                        The Alamo was established<br> as a Spanish mission in 1718.<br> For more than a century armed conflict<br> deprived it of its sacred purpose.<br> The church became<br> a makeshift fortification<br> against marauding Indians, rebels,<br> and a succession of conquering armies.<br> Location, proximity to settlements,<br> and perhaps even fate<br> made the Alamo a crossroads<br> for siege and battle.<br> Gregorio. Gregorio!<br> They're all dead!<br> Oh, God, they're all dead!<br> Massacred!<br> The Alamo has fallen!<br> They're dead, all of them!<br> They're all dead at the Alamo!<br> Did you hear what he said?<br> The Alamo!<br> Take the oath for militia duty,<br> and you will receive 640 acres..<br> ONE YEAR EARLIER<br> WASHINGTON DC, 1835<br> of your own choosing.<br> That's better.<br> Smooth.<br> If it doesn't burn going down,<br> how can you be sure it's bad for you?<br> I'll be interested to see you gentlemen<br> when you arrive in Texas<br> and have your first taste of mescal.<br> Is it true that men and women<br> imbathe together out in the open?<br> Cleanliness is next to godliness.<br> Yes, well.. excuse us.<br> Invest now, gentlemen,<br> or lament later.<br> I'm a screamer.<br> I got the roughest racehorse,<br> the prettiest sister,<br> the surest rifle and the ugliest dog<br> in the district.<br> My old man could lick<br> anybody in Tennessee,<br> and I could lick my old man.<br> I can outgrin a panther<br> and ride on a lightnin' bolt,<br> tote a steamboat on my back<br> and whip my weight in wildcats.<br> Whip my weight in wildcats.<br> Whip my weight in wildcats. Whip..<br> - What is it?<br> - He's here.<br> - Who's here?<br> - He is here!<br> Five minutes!<br> I'll tell you, these old bones<br> could sure use a respite.<br> 'Course, the good citizens of Tennessee<br> may grant me that wish come next election.<br> No!<br> - Excuse me one moment.<br> - Yes. Yes, of course.<br> Sam Houston.<br> Makin' friends wherever you go.<br> - To Tennessee.<br> - Oh, to hell with Tennessee.<br> To Texas.<br> It's sad, isn't it?<br> A year ago, we'd be looking at two men<br> with their caps set for the White House.<br> Now..<br> What you peddlin', Sam?<br> Somethin' a certain Congressman<br> might need before long.<br> Are you sellin' rockin' chairs?<br> I'm sellin' Texas.<br> And what would I want with Norte Mexico?<br> David, you remember<br> what Tennessee was?<br> You come to Texas.<br> Timber, water, game, cattle,<br> more land than you can possibly imagine.<br> You take the oath for militia duty, you will<br> receive 640 acres of your own choosing.<br> - My own choosing?<br> - Mm..hmm.<br> Sam! You figure this new republic's<br> gonna need a president?<br> Before we begin tonight's performance,<br> I should like to acknowledge<br> the presence of the man<br> whose life inspired our humble play.<br> Good evening, Mr Crockett.<br> Good evening, Mr Crockett.<br> SAN FELIPE, TEXAS<br> You want to call me an opportunist?<br> Hell, yes, call me an opportunist.<br> But taking the Alamo<br> changed everything.<br> - We're in control now.<br> - Yes!<br> We swore allegiance to Mexico under<br> the Federalist Constitution of 1824.<br> Santa Anna tore that document up<br> personally, did he not?<br> Named himself supreme dictator?<br> Well I for one, ain't swearin' allegiance<br> to no son-of-a-bitch dictator.<br> Yeah!<br> Neither am I.<br> Time to go, General.<br> They are talking crazy.<br> Drunk back sober.<br> It's a miracle of the first order.<br> Seguin, why'd they put me in charge<br> of the army if they won't listen to me?<br> We need to muster and train troops here,<br> not send soldiers all over Texas.<br> Idiots. They think Santa Anna's just gonna<br> hand over part of Mexico without a fight?<br> They are gonna want you humble,<br> General.<br> I humble myself before God,<br> and there the list ends.<br> To march an expedition<br> between here and Matamoros<br> is lunacy!<br> You do not split an army<br> into vagabond militias<br> that march off on the slightest pretext<br> like bloodthirsty rabble.<br> Do you really believe this war is over?<br> You opposed Bexar, but victory was ours!<br> Yeah!<br> And now you oppose Matamoros,<br> where victory will be as sweet.<br> No.<br> Perhaps, sir, you simply<br> oppose fighting.<br> Fighters shall lead the new country<br> of Texas, sir.<br> The council will now consider<br> the removal of General Houston<br> from command of the regular army.<br> - All in favour, show of hands.<br> - Aye!<br> The late, great Sam Houston,<br> former governor of Tennessee<br> and now former general<br> of the Texian army.<br> - Scottish catamite.<br> - What did you say?<br> I called you a Scottish catamite, Grant.<br> One step down from associate pederast.<br> - All right.<br> - Remain clothed!<br> Come for me! Come! Come!<br> Any excuse to start removin' your clothes,<br> is that right, Houston?<br> This is not your concern, Mr Bowie.<br> Indeed. This is between me<br> and the Scottish catamite.<br> Wanna borrow mine, Grant?<br> 'Cause I'll surely give it to ya.<br> Buy you a drink?<br> I didn't know you drank.<br> You marked the coat as single-breasted,<br> with a four-inch stand collar?<br> - As you desired, Mr Travis.<br> - Lieutenant Colonel.<br> And the epaulets are gold bullion?<br> Should be quite a sight.<br> Where would you like the uniform sent?<br> San Antonio de Bexar.<br> I'll be there defending the Alamo.<br> Defend against what? The Mexican army left<br> there with their tail between their legs.<br> Mr William.. she here.<br> In your office, waitin'.<br> Your wife.<br> Mr Bowie!<br> - Colonel.<br> - Buck.<br> Drunken Hottentot.<br> Two-bit dandy.<br> Well, the choices are<br> abandonment, adultery,<br> or cruel and barbarous treatment.<br> I think abandonment's most accurate.<br> Any of the choices would be appropriate.<br> You sure you want to do this?<br> Well, we..we signed the papers.<br> I meant Charlie.<br> I don't intend this harshly, but<br> he should have a male example in his life.<br> I've already made arrangements for him<br> to stay with a fine family while I'm away.<br> Well, we have a long way to travel.<br> Your father's becoming a rich man,<br> and he'll be able to see<br> to your education.<br> You're makin' a jackass<br> outta yourself, Sam.<br> Vindictive sons of bitches.<br> Texas.. wasted on the Texians.<br> They'll come back.<br> The Mexicans.<br> A well-trained army,<br> against all this handful of amateurs.<br> Only chance we have<br> is to fight 'em out in the open.<br> Forts, they're useless,<br> useless to us.<br> What is it about<br> that damn place, anyway?<br> What place?<br> The Alamo.<br> Every time a sour wind blows through,<br> everybody runs there and hides inside.<br> Ain't nothin' but mud.<br> A caved-in church.<br> And cannon.<br> Cannon.<br> Protects my home, Sam.<br> You don't have no home,<br> any more than I have.<br> It's a damn shame about your wife, Jim.<br> Am I still your general?<br> You know you are.<br> I want you to return to the Alamo,<br> fetch the cannon back.<br> Will you do that for me?<br> Will you promise<br> that you'll do that for me?<br> Yeah.<br> Now, you mind Mr and Mrs Ayers.<br> Don't go causing any fuss.<br> When I return,<br> we'll get a home of our own.<br> I promise.<br> "One crowded hour of glorious life"<br> "is worth an age without a name."<br> SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS<br> Jim Bowie's here!<br> - Know which one he is?<br> - Right there.<br> Welcome to San Antonio, Bowie!<br> - Welcome home, Jim.<br> - Welcome home, Mr Bowie.<br> Welcome home, Jim.<br> You all right, Mr James?<br> I have a home.<br> Sir?<br> We know you guys<br> from somewhere?<br> Whoo, that one's<br> pretty dandy, that one.<br> Halt!<br> - Have the quartermaster secure billeting.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Where you going, sir?<br> - I'd like to see what I'm fightin' for.<br> Dismount!<br> It was founded as a mission<br> The Bexarenos called it the Alamo,<br> after Alamo de Parras,<br> a Spanish cavalry unit<br> that moved in 30 years ago.<br> As you can see, it is not designed<br> with military intentions.<br> She's well armed.<br> Most cannon of any fort<br> west of the Mississippi.<br> I placed our largest, the 18-pounder,<br> on the southwest corner, so it fronts<br> the town.<br> The north wall is in ruins, so I have two<br> batteries with five cannon to defend it.<br> What was the original convento<br> is now barracks and a makeshift infirmary.<br> Major Jameson, our engineer,<br> is emplacing a palisade<br> between the main gate and the church.<br> - What was here before?<br> - Nothing. An indefensible flank.<br> It still appears indefensible.<br> Good riflemen and a 12-pounder<br> should hold it.<br> The church itself wasn't built till 1756.<br> It has no roof.<br> Was it destroyed in battle?<br> The Catholics never quite finished it.<br> Saints Dominic and Francis.<br> Francis had two gifts:<br> prophecy,<br> and the ability to inspire<br> passionate devotion.<br> This fort is the only thing<br> that stands between Santa Anna's army<br> and our settlements.<br> As goes the Alamo..<br> so goes Texas.<br> If the need arises, I recommend you take<br> my personal quarters on the west wall.<br> They're isolated,<br> yet near the primary defenses.<br> I'm afraid I don't understand, sir.<br> I have personal matters<br> to attend to in Mina.<br> I'm leaving you in command.<br> I know you fought this posting, Travis.<br> Forting up is not exactly<br> a cavalryman's dream.<br> I'll defend it with my life, sir.<br> Your biggest task will be keeping<br> the volunteers and the regulars<br> from killin' one another out of boredom.<br> The Mexican army would have to cover<br> to get here before I return.<br> I got one guy around my neck,<br> I got another guy takin' off half my ear<br> with his one good tooth.<br> The two that I knocked out are now<br> wakin' up, realisin' who knocked 'em out.<br> But I'm fine. I'm fine.<br> 'Cause I know I got my trusty, loyal Ward<br> right next to me.<br> So I turn over my shoulder,<br> and who do I find?<br> Tortilla lady<br> and her 13-year-old hound dog.<br> Where were ya?<br> I hate to tell you this, Jim,<br> but you were in the wrong.<br> Exactly. That's when I need you the most.<br> Oh, God. I love this place.<br> I love it, too.<br> Colonel?<br> You look terrible,<br> almost yellow right around<br> the cheeks and forehead.<br> You a doctor now,<br> along with everything else?<br> I've heard rumour that you plan to destroy<br> the mission and remove the cannon.<br> - Where'd you hear that?<br> - Men tend to prattle on when they drink.<br> Your men tend to drink.<br> It would be a great mistake.<br> I agree.<br> And any further discussion on this<br> will be between myself and Colonel Neill.<br> Colonel Neill left Bexar this morning<br> on personal business.<br> It's my command now.<br> Well, my, my, my.<br> That is a swift rise, Billy.<br> Might as well break out<br> those long britches.<br> Your men exhibit no discipline.<br> If matters don't change, it will become<br> my duty, as colonel of this post..<br> Lieutenant colonel.<br> Restrain your men.. or I will.<br> James..<br> sentries report hearing horses<br> just outside of town.<br> Don't move!<br> We got 'em, David.<br> It appears to me<br> that we're all on the same side here.<br> What you doin' out here?<br> My name is David Crockett.<br> Crockett of Tennessee?<br> Davy Crockett?<br> He prefers "David."<br> Now, there was this little detail<br> of a re-election back home.<br> Aww!<br> It's all right. It's all right.<br> - 'Cause you know what I told them folks?<br> - What'd you tell 'em?<br> I said, "You all can go to hell."<br> - "I'm goin' to Texas!"<br> - Yeah!<br> - Welcome to Texas, Davy.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Put your mark on it, Mr Crockett?<br> - Look out. Let me through here.<br> Absolutely.<br> "I'm half alligator,<br> half snappin' turtle."<br> "I can slide off a rainbow and jump<br> the Mississippi in a single leap."<br> Tell 'em, Davy,<br> how you can whup your weight in wildcats.<br> I seen you onstage.<br> Well, that wasn't me.<br> Why.. Why, sure it was.<br> No, sir, that was just an actor in a play.<br> He was performin' a character.<br> Aw, come on, Davy.<br> Say the lines.<br> Davy Crockett, the Lion of the West.<br> I dare Santa Anna to show his face<br> now you're here.<br> Well, I understood the fightin' was over.<br> Ain't it?<br> General, we've captured another<br> group of rebels.<br> Alto!<br> Shall we have them draw lots,<br> Your Excellency?<br> What for?<br> To determine which ones to execute.<br> Execute them all.<br> General, it is tradition.<br> If we follow tradition..<br> the people here will remember<br> that Fate took their loved ones.<br> Fuego!<br> Instead..<br> they will remember that it was<br> Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.<br> Well done.<br> You don't have the sand to even talk<br> to two of my men, much less arrest them.<br> I told you I intended<br> to restore order.<br> You've got no command<br> over my volunteers. None.<br> I have absolute command.<br> Break 'em out, boys.<br> Yeah.<br> 'Cause it's gonna be a cold day in hell<br> anybody takes orders from a debtor<br> who leaves his pregnant wife<br> in the middle of the night.<br> How about a land swindler<br> who marries a girl, God rest her soul,<br> for her father's money?<br> Whoa, whoa, fellers!<br> Hey, hey, hey, fellers, now, listen.<br> Just 'cause we ain't got nobody to fight<br> don't mean we need to fight one another.<br> Congressman Crockett has a point.<br> We should do this democratically.<br> A vote.<br> - What about Colonel Crockett leadin' us?<br> - No, I'm with you fellers, not above you.<br> All for the lieutenant colonel,<br> raise your hand.<br> Now, come on, men. No repercussions.<br> All in favour of me commanding.<br> And all for me?<br> All right.<br> You can command the militia only.<br> Regulars can't be led by a volunteer.<br> It's illegal.<br> You don't like the outcome,<br> you change the rule?<br> Is that it, Buck?<br> Aw, don't fret about it, Jim.<br> We all know who's in charge.<br> Why are you fighting for these low-lifes?<br> Because, the enemy of my enemy<br> is my friend.<br> But Santa Anna only wants<br> to rule Mexico..<br> these disgraces want the whole world.<br> You know, I don't know why<br> we had to tent up outside of town<br> when there are so many fine houses with<br> big corn-husk beds just sittin' empty.<br> Why are they empty?<br> Apparently some of the folks hereabouts<br> seem to think the Mexicans is comin' back.<br> Most of the boys think they wouldn't be<br> here till late spring if they come at all.<br> - Figure they know something we don't?<br> - Mijito, cierre la puerta y ven para aca.<br> Tell me what is going on!<br> We'll never be able to defend the town.<br> Orderly withdrawal<br> into the Alamo.<br> - Greys fall in!<br> - Close up!<br> Shoulder arms! Forward! Forward!<br> Orderly withdrawal!<br> Please proceed to the Alamo in an orderly<br> manner. Don't run. You're fine.<br> - Almeron!<br> - One, two, one, two.<br> Almeron!<br> Susanna!<br> There is a shotgun hidden in the closet.<br> Let's go, men!<br> Come on! Follow me!<br> Come on!<br> Colonel? I'm sorry to disturb you,<br> but we got quite a mare's nest out here.<br> I have to get couriers out<br> while there's still time.<br> You and your men<br> will defend the palisade.<br> The palisade? You talkin' about that<br> little old bunch of sticks over there?<br> You prefer a different assignment?<br> No, that's the one<br> I was gonna put in for.<br> If you could oversee manning the walls,<br> it would be a help.<br> We should have six men to a cannon,<br> - which works out to..<br> - 108 men.<br> And we should have a man with a musket<br> every four feet of wall.<br> We're gonna need more men.<br> Viva Santa Anna! Viva Mexico!<br> Your lodging is ready.<br> Are the advance troops encamped?<br> The batteries in place?<br> Yes, but it may not be necessary.<br> The Texians desire a truce.<br> Manuel..<br> How many times are we going to trade<br> this old church..<br> back and forth?<br> To Gonzales, and<br> to Colonel Fannin at Goliad.

Davy?<br> Why in the hell do you suppose<br> they don't just attack us?<br> I seen vaqueros spend all day long<br> just killin' one bull.<br> You bring a band, you're countin' on<br> havin' something to celebrate.<br> Mighty nice of 'em<br> to serenade us like this.<br> It's a cavalry march, but I'm told<br> Santa Anna fancies it for other uses.<br> He borrowed it from the Spaniards,<br> the Spaniards from the Moors.<br> - It's called "Deguello."<br> - Kinda pretty.<br> Deguello means "slit throat."<br> Now, ain't that pretty.<br> Get down!

No disparo."<br> What's that?<br> Mexican law said<br> there ain't no slaves, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - And contract or no, that's what you is.<br> Now, the Mexicans see your colour,<br> you tell 'em, "Don't shoot." They<br> pass you by.<br> But Mr William,<br> he gonna give me a gun, and I'll..<br> You clean up their shit, you take care of<br> their horses, you wash 'em, you feed 'em.<br> Damn if you ain't gonna die for 'em, too.<br> GONZALES, TEXAS<br> Where is everybody?<br> have already left for the Alamo.<br> Assemble the men that we have.<br> We need more men.<br> If they arrive every day,<br> soon we will have enough.<br> But for now, we wait.<br> If we can't run, we walk.<br> If we can't walk, we crawl.<br> But we gotta go to the aid of those boys.<br> It's only right.<br> General, I'm the man<br> who left Travis there.<br> I do not enjoy waiting<br> any more than the next man,<br> but I will not sacrifice Texas.<br> These 124 men cannot pierce<br> an army of thousands.<br> Colonel Fannin is en route from Goliad<br> with 400 men.<br> These troops need training.<br> I suggest that you commence with it.<br> - What should I tell Travis?<br> - Nothing. You're staying here.<br> No. General.. Sam.<br> I gave my word!<br> That's an order.<br> Dig her deep, boys.<br> Dig her deep.<br> Dig her deep.<br> Good work, boys.<br> Always good to have a fall-back position.<br> About the size of a grave,<br> ain't it, Cap?<br> Captain Dickinson..<br> I'm reassigning you and Private Esparza<br> to the battery at the rear of the church<br> so you can be near your families.<br> And I've arranged for a replacement<br> for your midnight watch.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Gracias.<br> Here you go, son.<br> So, Davy,<br> in all your lndian fightin',<br> you ever get into a scrape like this?<br> I was never in but one real scrape<br> in my life, feller.<br> - Yeah, but you was in the Red Stick War.<br> - Yeah, it's true. I was in that.<br> I sure was.<br> I was just about your age<br> when it broke out.<br> The Creeks boxed up<br> about 400 or 500 people at Fort Mims<br> and massacred every one of 'em.<br> Of course, this was big news around those<br> parts, so I up and joined the volunteers.<br> I did a little scoutin', but mostly..<br> I just fetched in venison for<br> the cookfire, things of that nature.<br> Well, we caught up with those redskins<br> at Tallushatchee,<br> surrounded the village,<br> come in from all directions.<br> Wasn't much of a fight, really.<br> We just shot 'em down like dogs.<br> Finally..<br> what lnjuns was left,<br> they crowded into this little cabin.<br> They wanted to surrender.<br> But this squaw, she loosed an arrow<br> and killed one of the fellers,<br> and then we shot her.<br> And then we set the cabin on fire.<br> We could hear 'em screamin'<br> for their gods in there.<br> We smelled 'em burnin'.<br> We'd had nary to eat<br> but parched corn since October.<br> And the next day,<br> when we dug through the ashes,<br> we found some potaters<br> from the cellar.<br> They'd been cooked by that grease<br> that run off them lndians.<br> And we ate till we nearly burst.<br> Since then..<br> you pass the taters,<br> I'll pass 'em right back.<br> He's been stabbed three times,<br> once through the lungs,<br> shot two or three times.<br> Cholera, malaria, every two years.<br> He is already dead.<br> And this is the place he has been sent.<br> We got riders!<br> Pull back.<br> Riders on the way!<br> Colonel Travis.<br> Congressman Crockett.<br> I figure this is just about<br> every able-bodied man in Gonzales, sir.<br> Those soldados,<br> they think they got it all sewed up.<br> But you avoid the roads, there's this<br> little sliver you can just ease on through.<br> And Colonel Fannin is behind you?<br> He ain't here?<br> I talked to him three days ago in Goliad.<br> That son of a bitch said he'd be here.<br> How many rode with you?<br> Brung ya 32 good men, sir.<br> And if it ain't the prettiest bunch<br> of Texians I ever seen.<br> Let's hear it for Gonzales, boys!<br> Has Houston arrived?<br> Excelencia..<br> Just a few men on horses.<br> I leave a corridor wide open for him.<br> Come here. Come to us.<br> Bring your army!<br> It is your opportunity to be<br> a great American hero.<br> Still, he does not come.<br> What am I supposed to do?<br> Send a message:<br> We grant safe passage to any native<br> Mexican choosing to leave the Alamo.<br> They will take their freedom..<br> and the men left behind..<br> will be thinking about escaping..<br> and will not fight like<br> men resigned to death.<br> Come on!<br> Fight!<br> You're yellow!<br> We're waitin'!<br> You look better.<br> Thank you for tending to me.<br> And now I want you to leave.<br> Sam..<br> You, too.<br> You giving me my papers, Mr James?<br> No. You're my property till I die.<br> And when I get up off my back,<br> I'm gonna come fetch ya.<br> For now I want you both to go.<br> Santa Anna ain't gonna<br> make that offer twice.<br> No. She was my sister.<br> You loved her.<br> Her blood was yours.<br> Your blood is mine.<br> We're family.<br> The men need a word from you.<br> I..<br> I don't know what to tell them.<br> My time in Washington,<br> the fellas in Congress<br> made a good deal of sport of me.<br> I learned an awful lot from 'em.<br> Learned how to dress,<br> to a certain degree,<br> what fork to use in polite company,<br> things like that.<br> I was never afraid<br> to stretch things a bit.<br> But I never learned to lie.<br> These people in here<br> been through an awful lot.<br> And I would allow that they've<br> earned the right to hear the truth.<br> I have here pieces of paper,<br> letters from politicians and generals,<br> but no indication of when,<br> or if, help will arrive.<br> Letters not worth the ink<br> committed to them.<br> I fear that..<br> no one is coming.<br> Texas has been a second chance for me.<br> I expect that might be true<br> for many of you as well.<br> It has been a chance<br> not only for land and riches,<br> but also to be a different man.<br> I hope a better one.<br> There have been many ideas<br> brought forth in the past few months<br> of what Texas is<br> and what it should become.<br> We are not all in agreement.<br> But I'd like to ask each of you<br> what it is you value so highly<br> that you are willing to fight<br> and possibly die for.<br> We will call that Texas.<br> The Mexican army hopes to<br> lure us into attempting escape.<br> Almost anything seems better<br> than remaining in this place, penned up.<br> If, however,<br> we force the enemy to attack,<br> I believe every one of you<br> will prove himself worth ten in return.<br> We will not only show the world<br> what patriots are made of,<br> but we will also deal a crippling blow<br> to the army of Santa Anna.<br> If anyone wishes to depart..<br> under the white flag of surrender,<br> you may do so now.<br> You have that right.<br> But if you wish to stay here,<br> with me, in the Alamo,<br> we will sell our lives dearly.<br> Leave it.<br> The light. I want the light.<br> What troubles you, Buck?<br> I spoke to the men earlier about our<br> situation. You deserve to hear it as well.<br> I heard, through the door, every word.<br> My words.<br> How painful for you.<br> Good words.<br> Good words.<br> We could try to get you out<br> with an escort.<br> If you're captured, perhaps, given<br> your condition, mercy would be extended.<br> I don't deserve mercy.<br> I do deserve a drink.<br> - You got anything stronger than water?<br> - I don't drink, Jim. You know that.<br> I gamble, go to whores,<br> run off on wives.<br> But drinkin'..<br> I draw the line.<br> You know, you live another five years,<br> you just might be a great man.<br> I think I will probably have to settle<br> for what I am now.<br> Buck..<br> Did it matter?<br> I'll see about fetchin' you a bottle.<br> God, I despise that tune.<br> I just figured it out.<br> Figured out what?<br> What it's missin'.<br> Take cover, boys!<br> Crockett.<br> It's amazing what a little harmony'll do.<br> Well, isn't that something?<br> Dearest Mary,<br> I hope someone with a kind voice<br> is reading this to you.<br> If you could see, you'd know<br> how beautiful this land.. our home.. is.<br> Kiss all six children for me,<br> and kiss them again.<br> The scarcity of paper, together<br> with other difficulties I've had<br> to labour under,<br> has prevented me from writing before this,<br> and, indeed, it is a matter of claim<br> whether this letter<br> will ever reach the United States.<br> Please remember me to my father<br> and tell him to think of nothing but of<br> coming to this fair country when it is free.<br> I go the whole hog<br> in the cause of Texas.<br> I expect to help them<br> gain their independence<br> and to also form their civil government,<br> for it is worth risking many lives for.<br> From what I have seen<br> and learned from others,<br> there is not so fair a portion<br> of the earth's surface warmed by the sun.<br> We know what awaits us,<br> and we are prepared to meet it.<br> My respects to all friends,<br> confusion to all enemies.<br> God bless you.<br> Take care of my little boy.<br> General Cos..<br> You will lead the first charge.<br> Here..<br> at the weak north wall.<br> Coronel Duque..<br> You will follow, from the northeast.<br> Romero..<br> From the east.<br> Morales..<br> South.<br> Our 12 pound cannon arrives tomorrow.<br> Why sacrifice our soldiers..<br> trying to take a wall<br> that can be demolished?<br> General Castrillon..<br> What are the lives of soldiers..<br> but so many chickens?<br> And if they surrender?<br> They are pirates..<br> not soldiers.<br> Take no prisoners.<br> There are rules governing ..<br> I am governing!<br> And you, sir, understand..<br> nothing of the difficulties<br> that entails!<br> My mission..<br> is to preserve the integrity<br> of the national territory.<br> Did we gain our independence only<br> to have our land stolen by bandits?<br> It stops here!<br> It must stop here!<br> If it does not, our grandchildren..<br> and their grandchildren..<br> will suffer the disgrace of begging for<br> crumbs from the Americans.<br> Without blood..<br> without tears..<br> there is no glory.<br> Agh!<br> Viva Santa Anna!<br> Viva Santa Anna!<br> Joe!<br> Fuego!<br> Faster, Joe, faster.<br> Ready?
