                        On November 1, 1959, the population<br> of New York City was 8,042,783.<br> If you laid them all end to end, figuring<br> an average height of 5 feet 6 and half inches,...<br> ..they would reach from Times Square<br> to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.<br> I know facts like this because I work for<br> an insurance company, Consolidated Life.<br> We're one of the top five companies<br> in the country.<br> Our home office has 31,259 employees,...<br> ..which is more than the entire population<br> of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.<br> I work on the 19th floor.<br> Ordinary Policy Department,...<br> ..Premium Accounting Division,<br> Section W, desk number 861.<br> My name is CC Baxter: C for Calvin, C for<br> Clifford. But most people call me Bud.<br> I've worked here three years, ten months,<br> and my take-home pay is $94.70 a week.<br> The hours in our department<br> are 8.50 to 5.20.<br> (Bell)<br> They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators<br> can handle the 31,259 employees...<br> ..without a serious traffic jam.<br> As for myself, I very often stay on at the<br> office and work for an extra hour or two,...<br> ..especially when the weather is bad.<br> It's not that I'm overly ambitious.<br> It's just a way of killing time...<br> ..until it's all right for me to go home.<br> You see, I have this little problem<br> with my apartment.<br> I live in the West 60s,<br> just half a block from Central Park.<br> My rent is $85 a month.<br> It used to be $80 until last July...<br> ..when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady,<br> put in a second-hand air conditioner.<br> It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy,<br> but kind of cozy. Just right for a bachelor.<br> The only problem is<br> I can't always get in when I want to.<br> (Latin-beat dance music)<br> (Woman hums along to music)<br> Cut it out, Sylvia.<br> We've gotta get out of here.<br> What's the panic?<br> I'm gonna have another martini.<br> Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.<br> First you can't wait to get me here<br> and then it's rush, rush, rush.<br> - Makes a person feel cheap.<br> - Sweetie, it's not that.<br> But I promised the guy<br> I'd be outta here by eight.<br> - What guy? Whose apartment is this?<br> - Some schnook that works in the office.<br> - Good evening, Mr. Baxter.<br> - Mrs. Lieberman.<br> Some weather we're having. Must be from<br> all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.<br> - You're locked out of your apartment?<br> - No, no. Just waiting for a friend.<br> - Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.<br> - Good night, Mr. Baxter.<br> - Where do you live?<br> - I told you. With my mother.<br> - Where does she live?<br> - 179th Street, in the Bronx.<br> - All right. I'll take you to the subway.<br> - Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.<br> - Why do all you dames live in the Bronx?<br> - You bring other girls up here?<br> Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.<br> - Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.<br> - Something's the matter?<br> Uh, no. I... seem to have<br> dropped my key. Ah, here it is.<br> Such a racket I heard in your place.<br> Maybe you had burglars?<br> Don't worry about that. There's nothing in<br> here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.<br> (Doorbell)<br> Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy,<br> but the little lady forgot her galoshes.<br> Mr. Kirkeby, you were supposed<br> to be outta here by eight.<br> I know, but those things don't always<br> run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.<br> I don't mind in the summer,<br> but on a rainy night...<br> - I haven't had any dinner yet.<br> - Sure, sure.<br> Oh!<br> I put in a good word for you<br> with Sheldrake in Personnel.<br> - Mr. Sheldrake?<br> - That's right.<br> We discussed manpower promotion-wise.<br> I told him you're a bright boy.<br> They're always on the lookout for<br> young executives. You're on your way up.<br> - And you're also out of liquor.<br> - Mr. Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans...<br> - ..last night he had a Halloween party.<br> - Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.<br> - You still owe me for the last two bottles.<br> - I'll pay you on Friday.<br> Oh, and whatever happened to those little<br> cheese crackers you used to have?<br> Cheese crackers?<br> Cheers.<br> - Good evening, Baxter.<br> - Hi, Doc. Had a late call?<br> Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate<br> a club sandwich - including the toothpick.<br> - Well, good night, Doc.<br> - Say, Baxter.<br> The way you're beltin' that stuff,<br> you must have cast-iron kidneys.<br> That's not me. Just once in a while<br> I have a few people in for a drink.<br> As a matter of fact, you must be<br> an iron man all around.<br> From what I hear through the walls,<br> you're at it every night.<br> - I'm sorry if it gets noisy.<br> - And sometimes there's a double-header.<br> - (Tuts) A nebbish like you.<br> - Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.<br> You know, I'm doing some research<br> at the Columbia Medical Center.<br> - Could you do us a favor?<br> - Me?<br> When you make out your will -<br> and the way you're going, you should -<br> would you mind leaving<br> your body to the university?<br> My body? I'm afraid you guys'd<br> be disappointed. Good night, Doc.<br> Slow down, kid.<br> Oh, for heaven...<br> From the world's greatest library<br> of film classics, we proudly present...<br> ..Greta Garbo, John Barrymore,...<br> ..Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery<br> and Lionel Barrymore...<br> ..in "Grand Hotel".<br> But first, a word from our sponsor.<br> If you smoke the modern way,<br> don't be fooled by phony filter claims.<br> (Bugle: cavalry charge)<br> And now, "Grand Hotel"...<br> ..starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore,...<br> ..Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery<br> and Lionel Barrymore.<br> But first, a word<br> from our alternate sponsor.<br> Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?<br> (Phone rings)<br> - Hello.<br> - Hiya, Buddy-boy.<br> I'm in this bar on 61st Street<br> and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.<br> That's very nice of you but... who is this?<br> Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.<br> - Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize your voice.<br> - That's OK, Buddy-boy.<br> Like I was saying, I'm in this joint<br> on 61st and I think I got lucky.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. I like to help<br> you fellas out, but it's sort of late.<br> - Why don't we make it some other time?<br> - Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.<br> She looks like Marilyn Monroe.<br> I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping<br> pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.<br> We're doing the monthly efficiency rating.<br> I'm putting you in the top ten.<br> You don't wanna<br> louse yourself up, do you?<br> No. But how can I be efficient in the<br> office if I don't get enough sleep at night?<br> It's only eleven, and I just<br> want the place for 45 minutes.<br> I'm getting lonely.<br> Who are you talking to, anyway?<br> - My mother.<br> - Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.<br> Ooh!<br> Make it 30 minutes.<br> What do you say, Bud, huh?<br> I'm all out of liquor,<br> there's no clean glasses...<br> - There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'.<br> - Let me worry about that.<br> Just leave the key under the mat<br> and clear out.<br> Yes, Mr. Dobisch.<br> Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch<br> No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch<br> Be my guest!<br> We never close at Buddy-boy's.<br> "Looks like Marilyn Monroe"!<br> - This the place?<br> - Yeah.<br> - How much?<br> - 70 cents.<br> Get the money, will you?<br> Watch those stingers!<br> - Give him a buck.<br> - Thanks, lady.<br> Put it back, honey!<br> Attagirl.<br> - Are you sure this is a good idea?<br> - Can't think of a better one.<br> Barging in on your mother so late at night.<br> Don't worry about the old lady. One<br> squawk from her and she's out of a job.<br> (Door closes)<br> Get the key, will you?<br> Not there! Under the mat.<br> - Under the mat?<br> - Yeah. Come on.<br> Open up. We haven't got all night.<br> - This is your mother's apartment?<br> - That's right.<br> (Drunken giggling)<br> (Latin-beat dance music)<br> Mildred! He's at it again!<br> - Morning, Mr. Kirkeby.<br> - How are you, Baxter?<br> - They keeping you busy these days?<br> - Yes, sir. They are indeed.<br> Good morning, Mr. Kessel, Miss Robinson,<br> Mr. Williams, Miss Livingston.<br> Good morning, Mr. McKellway,<br> Mrs. Schubert, Mr. Davis.<br> Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.<br> Good morning, Mr. Baxter.<br> - Morning, Miss Kubelik.<br> - That's all. Take it away.<br> Watch the door, please. Blasting off.<br> - What did you do to your hair?<br> - It made me nervous so I chopped it off.<br> - Big mistake, huh?<br> - No. I sort of like it. (Snuffles)<br> - You got a lulu.<br> - Yeah. Better not get too close.<br> - I never catch colds.<br> - Really?<br> I was reading some sickness<br> and accident claims figures.<br> The average New Yorker aged between<br> - That makes me feel just terrible.<br> - Why?<br> If I have no colds a year, some poor slob<br> must have five colds a year.<br> - Yeah. It's me.<br> - You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.<br> I shoulda stayed in bed last night.<br> Watch your step.<br> - And watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby!<br> - Pardon?<br> One of these days I'm gonna<br> shut these doors on you and...<br> That Kubelik. Boy, would I like<br> to get her on a slow elevator to China!<br> - She's the best operator in the building.<br> - I'm pretty good myself.<br> - But she won't give me a date.<br> - Maybe it's your approach.<br> A lot of guys around here have tried<br> all kinds of approaches. No dice.<br> - What's she trying to prove?<br> - She could just be a nice respectable girl.<br> Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.<br> (Bell)<br> Hello. Mr. Dobisch?<br> This is Baxter on the 19th floor.<br> Oh, Buddy-boy!<br> I was just about to call you. I'm sorry<br> about that mess on the living room wall.<br> My friend kept insisting Picasso was<br> a bum, so she started to do that mural.<br> It's not Picasso I'm calling about.<br> It's the key to my apartment.<br> You're supposed to leave it under the mat.<br> But I did. I distinctly<br> remember putting it there.<br> Oh, I found the key all right.<br> Only it's the wrong key!<br> It is? No wonder I couldn't get into<br> the executive washroom this morning.<br> And I couldn't get into my apartment!<br> So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady<br> and give her a whole song and dance.<br> That's a shame.<br> I'll send the key right down.<br> And about your promotion.<br> I'll send that efficiency report<br> to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.<br> You may hear from him<br> before the day's over.<br> Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.<br> (Coughs)<br> From Mr. Dobisch.<br> Wait.<br> For Mr. Dobisch.<br> Mm-hm. Mm-hm.<br> (Phone rings)<br> Vanderhof. Public Relations.<br> Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.<br> All right, Miss Finch.<br> Type up what we got so far.<br> Look, I've got you down for tonight,...<br> ..but I'll be using the place myself,<br> so I'll have to cancel.<br> But it's her birthday.<br> I already ordered the cake.<br> But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a<br> fever. I got to go to bed right after work.<br> If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.<br> Spend the night. Sweat it out.<br> That's how you get pneumonia. If I got<br> pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.<br> OK. You made your point. We'll just<br> have to do it next Wednesday night.<br> - It's the only night I can get away.<br> - Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.<br> I got somebody penciled in.<br> Let me see what I can do.<br> I'll get back to you.<br> - Mr. Eichelberger.<br> - Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?<br> Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws<br> a little monkey wrench into my agenda.<br> Thursday? No,<br> I'm all tied up on Thursday.<br> Let's schedule that, uh...<br> meeting for Friday.<br> Friday.<br> Let me see what I can do.<br> I'll get back to you.<br> Premium-wise and billing-wise, we are 18<br> per cent ahead of last year October-wise.<br> (Phone rings)<br> Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?<br> Instead of Friday, could you<br> possibly switch to Thursday?<br> You'd be doing me a great favor.<br> Let me check. I'll get back to you.<br> Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.<br> Sylvia, it's for you.<br> Yeah?<br> Oh, hello.<br> Sure I got home all right.<br> You owe me 45 cents.<br> Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,<br> could we make it Thursday night?<br> Thursday?! Well, that's<br> The Untouchables with Bob Stack!<br> Bob who?<br> All right, so we'll watch it<br> at the apartment. Big deal!<br> Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.<br> Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.<br> Mr. Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.<br> Mr. Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.<br> All right. I'll tell him.<br> Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.<br> Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.<br> She's been trying to reach you for the last<br> - Are you getting promoted? Or fired?<br> - Would you care to make a small wager?<br> - I've been here twice as long as you but...<br> - Let's say a dollar?<br> It's a bet!<br> - Going up?<br> - Oh! Excuse me.<br> precious cargo. I mean manpower-wise.<br> You may not realize it, but I am<br> in the top ten, efficiency-wise,...<br> ..and this may be the day promotion-wise.<br> You're beginning to sound<br> like Mr. Kirkeby already.<br> - Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?<br> - Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.<br> You know, you're the only one<br> who takes his hat off in the elevator.<br> Something happens to men in elevators.<br> It's the change of altitude.<br> The blood rushes to their head.<br> - I could tell you stories...<br> - I'd love to hear 'em.<br> We could have lunch<br> in the cafeteria sometime.<br> Or some evening, after work?<br> - 27.<br> - Oh.<br> - I hope everything goes all right.<br> - I hope so.<br> They would call me today,<br> what with my cold.<br> - How do I look?<br> - Fine. Wait.<br> Thank you.<br> I noticed, when you were still on the<br> local elevator, you always wore a flower.<br> Good luck. And wipe your nose.<br> CC Baxter, Ordinary Premium Accounting.<br> Mr. Sheldrake called me.<br> I called you. That is,<br> I tried to for 20 minutes.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Go on in.<br> - Baxter?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Come in, come in.<br> I was sort of wondering<br> what you looked like, Baxter.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> Been hearing some nice things about you.<br> Mr. Dobisch says you're loyal,<br> cooperative, resourceful.<br> - Mr. Dobisch said that?<br> - Mr. Kirkeby tells me you often work late...<br> - ..without overtime.<br> - You know how it is. Things pile up.<br> Mr. Vanderhof in Public Relations and<br> Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...<br> ..would both like you<br> transferred to their departments.<br> Very flattering.<br> Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it<br> that makes you so popular?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Think.<br> - Would you mind repeating the question?<br> - Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.<br> I know everything that goes on<br> in this building every day of the year.<br> You do?<br> In 1957 we had an employee here,<br> name of Fowler. He was very popular too.<br> It turned out<br> he was running a bookie joint,...<br> ..tying up our switchboard, using<br> our IBM machines to figure the odds.<br> The day before the Kentucky Derby I<br> called in the vice squad, who raided him.<br> - The vice squad?<br> - That's right.<br> What's that got to do with me?<br> I'm not running any bookie joint.<br> - Just what kind of joint are you running?<br> - Sir?<br> A key is floating around from Kirkeby<br> to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.<br> It's the key to a certain apartment.<br> - Know who that apartment belongs to?<br> - Who?<br> Loyal, resourceful, cooperative CC Baxter.<br> - Oh.<br> - Are you going to deny it?<br> No. I'm not going to deny it.<br> If you'd just let me explain.<br> You'd better.<br> Well,...<br> ..about a year ago, I was going to night<br> school, studying advanced accounting.<br> One of the guys in our department lives<br> in Jersey had to go to a banquet in town.<br> He needed someplace to change<br> into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.<br> Word must've gotten out because all sorts<br> of guys were suddenly going to banquets.<br> You give the key to one guy, you can't<br> say no to another. It all got out of hand.<br> Baxter, an insurance company<br> is founded on public trust.<br> Any employee who conducts himself<br> in a manner unbecoming...<br> How many charter members<br> are there in this little club?<br> Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.<br> So actually we can be very proud<br> of our personnel... percentage-wise.<br> That's not the point. Four rotten apples<br> in a barrel, however large the barrel...<br> - Do you realize if this ever leaked out...<br> - It won't!<br> Believe me. Never again. Nobody<br> is gonna use my apartment from now on.<br> - Where is your apartment?<br> - West 67th Street.<br> You have no idea what I go through with<br> the neighbors, the landlady and the key.<br> How do you work it with the key?<br> I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave<br> it under a mat. Never again. I promise.<br> (Intercom buzzer)<br> - Yes, Miss Olsen?<br> - Mrs. Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.<br> (Sheldrake) Yes, dear. Where were you?<br> You had to take Tommy to the dentist?<br> No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.<br> - Where are you going, Baxter?<br> - I don't wanna intrude.<br> - Since this is straightened out...<br> - I'm not through with you yet.<br> I won't be home for dinner tonight.<br> The branch manager from Kansas City<br> is in town. I'm taking him to the theatre.<br> Music Man. What else?<br> No, don't wait up for me,<br> darling. Goodbye.<br> Tell me, Baxter.<br> Have you seen Music Man?<br> Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.<br> How would you like to go tonight?<br> You and me? I thought you were taking<br> the branch manager from Kansas City.<br> No, I have other plans.<br> You can have both tickets.<br> Well... that's very kind of you.<br> But I'm not feeling well. I've got<br> this cold. I'm gonna go right home.<br> Baxter, you're not reading me.<br> I told you I have plans.<br> So do I. I'm gonna take<br> four aspirins, get into bed.<br> So give the tickets to somebody else.<br> Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving<br> these tickets. I wanna swap them.<br> Swap 'em? For what?<br> It also says here that you are<br> alert, astute and quite imaginative.<br> Oh?<br> Oh...<br> That's good thinking, Baxter. There's<br> gonna be a shift in personnel next month.<br> And as far as I'm concerned,<br> you are executive material.<br> - I am?<br> - Now put down the key.<br> And put down the address.<br> It's on the second floor. There's no name<br> over the door. It just says apartment 2A.<br> - It's that cold.<br> - Relax, Baxter.<br> Yes, thank you, sir.<br> You will be careful with<br> the record player? Shh.<br> Oh, and about the liquor.<br> I ordered some this morning.<br> I don't know when they'll deliver it.<br> - This is going to be our little secret.<br> - Of course.<br> - You know how people talk.<br> - Don't worry about that.<br> - Not that I have anything to hide.<br> - No! Anyway, it's none of my business.<br> Four apples, five apples.<br> What's the difference?<br> Percentage-wise.<br> Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.<br> You too, sir.<br> So I figure, a man in his position,<br> he'll take me to EI Morocco, maybe 21.<br> Instead he takes me to Hamburger<br> Heaven and some schnook's apartment.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Oh! Miss Kubelik?<br> I've been waiting for you.<br> I almost didn't recognize you.<br> This is the first time<br> I've seen you in civilian clothes.<br> - How'd it go on the 27th floor?<br> - Great.<br> - Look, have you seen The Music Man?<br> - No.<br> - Would you like to?<br> - Sure.<br> We could get a bite to eat first,<br> and then go.<br> - Oh, you mean tonight?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.<br> - Oh.<br> - You mean... Like a girlfriend?<br> - No. Like a man.<br> I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas<br> in the office were wondering if you ever...<br> You tell 'em now and then.<br> This date, is it... just a date?<br> Or is it something serious?<br> Well, it used to be serious.<br> At least, I was. But he wasn't.<br> So now the whole thing is<br> more or less kaput.<br> - In that case, couldn't you...<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> I promised I'd have a drink with him.<br> He's been calling me all week.<br> I understand.<br> Well, it was just an idea. I hate<br> to see a theatre ticket go to waste.<br> - What time does the show go on?<br> - 8.30.<br> Well, I could meet you at the theatre.<br> That's wonderful!<br> It's the Majestic on 44th Street.<br> I'll meet you in the lobby.<br> You know, I felt so lousy<br> this morning. Had 101 fever.<br> Now along comes my promotion<br> and us - 11th row centre.<br> And you said I should've stayed in bed.<br> - How is your cold?<br> - What cold?<br> After the show we could go out<br> on the town. (Hums dance tune)<br> - I've been taking from Arthur Murray.<br> - So I see.<br> There's a great band<br> at EI Chico, in the Village.<br> - Around the corner from where you live.<br> - Sounds good.<br> - How do you know where I live?<br> - Oh, I... even know who you live with.<br> Your sister and brother-in-law.<br> I know when you were born and where.<br> I know all sorts of things about you.<br> How come?<br> A couple of months ago I looked up<br> your card in the group insurance file.<br> I know your height and your weight<br> and your social security number.<br> You had mumps and measles<br> and you had your appendix out.<br> Don't mention the appendix<br> to the fellas in the office.<br> I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea<br> about how you found out. Bye.<br> (Light music)<br> (Plays "Jealous Lover")<br> - Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> - Please, Fran. Not so loud.<br> Still afraid someone<br> might see us together?<br> - Let me take your coat.<br> - No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.<br> - Can I have a frozen daiquiri?<br> - It's on the way.<br> - I see you went ahead and cut your hair.<br> - That's right.<br> - You know I liked it better long.<br> - I know.<br> You want a lock to carry in your wallet?<br> - Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.<br> - Thank you.<br> How long has it been, Fran? A month?<br> Six weeks. But who's counting?<br> I missed you.<br> Like old times.<br> Same booth. Same song.<br> - It's been hell.<br> - Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.<br> You don't know what it's like,<br> next to you in that elevator.<br> "Good morning, Miss Kubelik."<br> "Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."<br> I'm still crazy about you, Fran.<br> Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?<br> I'm just beginning to get over it.<br> I don't believe you.<br> Look, Jeff. We had two<br> wonderful months this summer.<br> But that was it. Happens all the time.<br> Wife and kids go away to the country and<br> the boss has a fling with his secretary,...<br> ..or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.<br> Come September,<br> the picnic's over. Goodbye.<br> The kids go back to school,<br> the boss goes back to the wife,...<br> ..and the girl...<br> They don't make these shrimp<br> like they used to.<br> I never said goodbye, Fran.<br> For a while there, you try kidding yourself<br> that you're going with an unmarried man.<br> Then one day he keeps<br> looking at his watch...<br> ..and asks you if any lipstick's showing,...<br> ..then rushes out to catch<br> the 7.14 to White Plains.<br> So you fix yourself<br> a cup of instant coffee...<br> ..and you sit there<br> by yourself and you think,...<br> ..and it all begins to look so... ugly.<br> How do you think I felt<br> riding home on that 7.14 train?<br> Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?<br> What do you want from me?<br> I want you back, Fran.<br> Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.<br> You'll have to take the next elevator.<br> You're not giving me a chance, Fran.<br> I have something to tell you.<br> - Go ahead. Tell me.<br> - Not here. Can't we go someplace else?<br> - No. I have a date at 8.30.<br> - Oh?<br> - Important?<br> - Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.<br> - You ready order dinner now?<br> - No. No dinner.<br> Just bring us two more drinks, will you?<br> (Coughs)<br> Fran, do you remember<br> that last weekend we had?<br> Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me<br> in a black negligee and a life preserver.<br> Do you remember what we talked about?<br> - We talked about a lot of things.<br> - I mean about my getting a divorce.<br> We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.<br> You didn't believe me, did you?<br> They got it on a long-playing record now.<br> "Music to String Her Along By."<br> "My wife doesn't understand me. You're<br> the best thing that ever happened to me."<br> - That's enough, Fran.<br> - "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."<br> - You're not being funny.<br> - I wasn't trying.<br> - Fran, just listen to me for a minute.<br> - All right. I'm sorry.<br> I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted<br> his advice about the best way to handle it.<br> - Handle what?<br> - What do you think?<br> Let's get something straight, Jeff.<br> I never asked you to leave your wife.<br> Of course not. You had<br> nothing to do with it.<br> Are you sure that's what you want?<br> I'm sure... if you'll just tell me<br> that you still love me.<br> You know I do.<br> Fran.<br> (Woman laughs)<br> Jeff, darling...<br> It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.<br> (Pianist plays "Jealous Lover")<br> Taxi!<br> - Jeff, I have that date, remember?<br> - But I love you, remember?<br> - (Whistles)<br> - Where are we going?<br> - Not back to that leaky boat?<br> - I promise.<br> Congratulations.<br> Would you mind? CC Baxter - that's me.<br> Thank you.<br> (Door opens)<br> (Kirkeby) Hi, Buddy-boy.<br> Congratulations and all that jazz.<br> - Hi, fellas.<br> - Well, you made it, just like we promised.<br> Quite an office.<br> Name on the door, rug on the floor.<br> Teamwork: that's what counts in this<br> organization. All for one and one for all.<br> - Know what I mean?<br> - I have a vague idea.<br> Baxter, we're a little disappointed<br> in you, gratitude-wise.<br> - Oh, I'm very grateful.<br> - Then why are you locking us out?<br> Well, it's been sort of rough the past few<br> weeks, what with my cold and... Like that.<br> We went to bat for you.<br> Now you won't play ball with us.<br> After all, it's my apartment. It's<br> private property, not a public playground.<br> So you got yourself a girl. That's OK<br> with us. But not every night in the week!<br> How selfish can you get?<br> Last week I had to use my nephew's car<br> and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.<br> I'm too old for that sort of thing -<br> I mean in a Volkswagen.<br> I sympathize with you.<br> Believe me, I'm very sorry.<br> - You'll be a lot sorrier.<br> - Are you threatening me?<br> Listen, Baxter. We made you<br> and we can break you.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> - Good morning, gentlemen.<br> - Baxter, do you like your office?<br> - Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.<br> Don't thank me.<br> Your friends here recommended you.<br> - We just dropped by to wish him luck.<br> - We know you won't let us down.<br> So long, fellas. Drop in any time.<br> The door is always open... to my office.<br> I like the way you handled that, Baxter.<br> - How does it feel to be an executive?<br> - Oh, fine.<br> - I'll work hard to justify your confidence.<br> - I'm sure you will.<br> About the apartment. Now that you've got<br> a raise, can't we afford a second key?<br> - I guess so.<br> - You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?<br> - Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that...?<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,<br> and passing that key back and forth...<br> - Why take chances?<br> - You can't be too careful.<br> Oh, I... have something<br> I think belongs to you.<br> - Me?<br> - I mean the young lady, whoever she is.<br> - I found it when I got back last night.<br> - Oh. Thanks.<br> The mirror is broken.<br> It was broken when I found it.<br> - Yeah. She threw it at me.<br> - Sir?<br> You know how it is.<br> They always give you a bad time.<br> Yeah, I know how it is.<br> You see a girl every week for laughs and<br> they think you're gonna divorce your wife.<br> - Now I ask you, is that fair?<br> - No, sir. It's very unfair.<br> - Especially to your wife.<br> - Yeah.<br> You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,<br> all the dames you want, no complications.<br> That's the life all right.<br> - Put me down for Thursday again.<br> - Roger.<br> And I'll get that other key.<br> - Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.<br> - Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.<br> Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.<br> Yeah? Yeah?!<br> Where?<br> You bet!<br> Somebody watch my line. There's<br> a swingin' party on the 19th floor!<br> # Oh, what fun it is to ride<br> in a one-horse open sleigh<br> # Hey! Jingle bells,<br> jingle bells, jingle all the way<br> # Oh, what fun it is to ride<br> in a one-horse open sleigh<br> (Singing continues)<br> So I said to him "Never again. Either you<br> get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."<br> Miss Kubelik? Miss...<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I thought you were avoiding me.<br> - What gave you that idea?<br> In six weeks you've only been in my<br> elevator once, and you kept on your hat.<br> As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt<br> that night you stood me up.<br> I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.<br> - I forgive you.<br> - You shouldn't.<br> You couldn't help it. You can't<br> suddenly walk out on one man...<br> ..because you have a date<br> with another man.<br> - You did the decent thing.<br> - Don't be too sure.<br> Just because I wear a uniform,<br> that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.<br> A second administrative assistant has<br> to be a pretty good judge of character.<br> And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.<br> I mean decency-wise and... otherwise-wise.<br> Cheers.<br> - One more.<br> - I shouldn't drink while driving.<br> You're so right. By the power vested<br> in me, I declare this elevator out of order.<br> Shall we join the natives?<br> - Why not? They seem friendly enough.<br> - Don't you believe it?<br> There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar<br> workers tossed into computers...<br> ..and punched full of little square holes.<br> - How many drinks did you have?<br> - Three!<br> - I thought so.<br> - Wait. I hear the sound of running water.<br> - I'll be right back!<br> - I'll be right here.<br> (Slurring) Hi!<br> How's the branch manager<br> from Kansas City?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - I'm Miss Olsen.<br> Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.<br> So you don't have to<br> play innocent with me.<br> He used to tell his wife<br> I was the branch manager from Seattle...<br> ..four years ago when we were having<br> a little ring-a-ding-ding.<br> - I don't know what you're talking about.<br> - Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.<br> And after me it was<br> Miss Koch in Disability.<br> And right before you was a Miss, um...<br> Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.<br> - Would you excuse me?<br> - What for? You haven't done anything.<br> It's him. Oh, what a salesman!<br> Always the last booth<br> in the Chinese restaurant...<br> ..and the same pitch<br> about divorcing his wife.<br> Then, in the end, you wind up<br> with egg foo yung on your face.<br> Miss Kubelik!<br> Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.<br> Always happy to do a little something<br> for our girls in uniform.<br> Are you all right? What's the matter?<br> Nothing. There are just<br> too many people here.<br> Why don't we step into my office? There's<br> something I want your opinion about.<br> I have my own office now. I'm the second<br> youngest executive in this company.<br> The only one younger is a grandson<br> of the chairman of the board.<br> (Whistles) Do you mind?<br> Miss Kubelik, I would like<br> your honest opinion.<br> I've had this under my desk<br> for a week. It cost me $15.<br> I haven't been able<br> to get up enough nerve to wear it.<br> It's what they call the Junior Executive<br> model. What do you think?<br> I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?<br> - I like it.<br> - Really?<br> You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen<br> with somebody in this hat?<br> - Of course not.<br> - Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.<br> - Is that better?<br> - Much better.<br> Since you wouldn't be<br> ashamed to be seen with me,...<br> ..how about goin' out tonight -<br> you, me and the bowler?<br> We'll stroll down 5th Avenue,<br> sort of break it in.<br> - This is a bad day for me.<br> - I understand. Christmas and family.<br> I'd better get back to my elevator<br> or I'll be fired.<br> Don't worry about that. I've got<br> quite a bit of influence with Personnel.<br> You know Mr. Sheldrake?<br> - Why?<br> - He and I are like that.<br> Sent me a Christmas card. See?<br> Makes a cute picture.<br> I could talk to Mr. Sheldrake.<br> Get you a promotion.<br> - Would you like to be an elevator starter?<br> - Too many girls have seniority over me.<br> No problem. Why don't we<br> discuss it over the holidays?<br> I could call you, pick you up, have<br> a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?<br> I think so. Here.<br> It's not tilted too much?<br> This is a conservative firm.<br> I don't want people<br> to think I'm an entertainer.<br> What's the matter?<br> - The mirror. It's broken.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> I like it that way.<br> Makes me look the way I feel.<br> (Phone rings)<br> Your phone.<br> Yes?<br> Uh, just a minute.<br> - If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.<br> - Have a nice Christmas.<br> Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the<br> Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.<br> Yes, sir. Same to you.<br> (Cheering)<br> Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?<br> The party's just starting.<br> Listen, kid. Gimme a break.<br> How about tomorrow afternoon?<br> I can't take her to that drive-in again.<br> The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?<br> (Slow band music)<br> Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon,<br> and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!<br> (Music ends)<br> You buy me a drink,<br> I'll buy you some music.<br> Rum Collins.<br> Uh...<br> Rum Collins and...<br> another one of these little mothers.<br> ("O Come, All Ye Faithful")<br> You like Castro?<br> I mean, how do you feel about Castro?<br> - What is Castro?<br> - You know. That big shot down in Cuba.<br> - With the crazy beard.<br> - What about him?<br> Cos as far as I'm concerned,<br> he's a no-good fink.<br> Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter.<br> Never even answered me.<br> That so?<br> All I wanted him to do was<br> let Mickey out for Christmas.<br> - Who's Mickey?<br> - My husband.<br> He's in Havana, in jail.<br> - Mixed up in that revolution?<br> - Mickey would do nothin' like that.<br> He's a jockey.<br> They caught him dopin' a horse.<br> Well, you can't win 'em all.<br> 'Twas the night before Christmas,<br> and all through the house<br> Not a creature was stirrin'...<br> Nothin'. No action.<br> Dullsville.<br> - You married?<br> - No.<br> - Family?<br> - No.<br> A night like this, it sort of spooks you<br> to walk into an empty apartment.<br> I said I had no family. I didn't say<br> I had an empty apartment.<br> (Fran crying)<br> Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.<br> Are you just gonna<br> sit there and keep bawling?<br> You won't talk to me?<br> You won't tell me what's wrong?<br> I know you think I'm stalling you but...<br> when you've been married for 12 years,...<br> ..you just don't sit down to breakfast and<br> say "Pass the sugar. I want a divorce."<br> It's not that easy.<br> Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids<br> are off school, my in-laws are visiting.<br> I can't bring it up now.<br> (Fran sobs)<br> This isn't like you, Fran. You were always<br> such a good sport. Such fun to be with.<br> That's me. The happy idiot.<br> A million laughs.<br> Well, that's a little more like it.<br> At least you're speaking to me.<br> A funny thing happened to me<br> at the office party today.<br> I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.<br> You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?<br> And I laughed so much, I like to died.<br> Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?<br> Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.<br> Well, I never was very good at history.<br> Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,<br> and then there was Miss Rossi.<br> No, she came before.<br> Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.<br> - Now, Fran...<br> - And just think.<br> Right now some lucky girl in the building<br> is gonna come after me.<br> OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.<br> But ask yourself: why does a man<br> run around with a lot of girls?<br> Because he's unhappy at home.<br> Because he's lonely. That's why.<br> But that was before you, Fran.<br> I've stopped running.<br> How could I be so stupid?<br> You'd think I would've learned by now.<br> When you're in love with a married man,<br> you shouldn't wear mascara.<br> It's Christmas Eve, Fran.<br> Let's not fight, huh?<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - What is it?<br> Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.<br> - Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here.<br> - Yeah, we'd better.<br> Oh, I have a present for you.<br> I didn't know what to get you. Besides,<br> it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...<br> Here's $100. You go<br> and buy yourself something.<br> They have some nice<br> alligator bags at Bergdorf's.<br> I didn't realize it was so late. Its quarter<br> to seven. I mustn't miss my train.<br> If we hadn't wasted all this time...<br> I have to get home and trim the tree.<br> OK. I just thought,<br> as long as it was paid for...<br> Don't ever talk like that, Fran.<br> - Don't make yourself out to be cheap.<br> - $100? I don't call that cheap.<br> And you must be paying somebody<br> something for the use of the apartment.<br> Stop it, Fran.<br> You'll miss your train, Jeff.<br> Are you coming?<br> No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.<br> Don't forget to kill the lights.<br> See you Monday.<br> Sure. Monday... and Thursday...<br> ..and Monday again, and Thursday again.<br> It won't always be like this, Fran.<br> I love you.<br> Careful. Lipstick.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> (Sighs)<br> ("Jealous Lover")<br> (Sniffs)<br> (Sobs)<br> (Big band blues)<br> - Drink up, pop. It's closing time.<br> - But it's early, Charlie.<br> - Don't you know what night this is?<br> - I know, Charlie. I know.<br> I work for the outfit.<br> Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.<br> O-U-T. Out!<br> Where'll we go? My place or yours?<br> Might as well go to mine.<br> Everybody else does.<br> Poor Mickey. When I think of him<br> all by himself in that jail in Havana...<br> Would you like to see his picture?<br> Not particularly.<br> He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.<br> Like a little Chihuahua.<br> - Can I ask you a personal question?<br> - No.<br> You got a girlfriend?<br> She may be a girl<br> but she is no friend of mine.<br> - Still stuck on her, huh?<br> - Obviously you don't know me very well.<br> - I don't know you at all.<br> - Permit me.<br> CC Baxter. Junior executive,<br> Arthur Murray graduate... lover.<br> I'm Mrs. MacDougall. Margie to you.<br> This way, Mrs. MacDougall.<br> Say! This is snugsville!<br> Mrs. MacDougall,<br> it's only fair to warn you...<br> ..you are now alone<br> with a notorious sexpot.<br> - No kiddin'!<br> - Ask anybody around here.<br> As a matter of fact, when it's time for me<br> to go - and I may go just like that -<br> I have promised my body<br> to the Columbia Medical Center.<br> Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps<br> just to think about it.<br> They haven't got me yet, baby.<br> Dig up some ice from the kitchen.<br> Let's not waste any more time<br> preliminary-wise.<br> I'm with you, lover.<br> (Latin-beat dance music)<br> (Hums along)<br> All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.<br> Come on. It's past checking-out time.<br> The management would appreciate it<br> if you'd get the hell outta here.<br> I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.<br> Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.<br> O-U-T, out!<br> Come on, wake up.<br> Oh my God.<br> Miss Kubelik?<br> Miss Kubelik?<br> I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.<br> You oughta buy yourself<br> a new refrigerator.<br> I didn't mean right now!<br> Dr. Dreyfuss.<br> Doc!<br> There's a girl in my place, took<br> some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.<br> - Let me get my bag.<br> - Hurry up!<br> Hey, over here, lover.<br> What's all the running around about?<br> You're gonna wear yourself out.<br> - Not so rough, honey!<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night?!<br> - The party's over.<br> What? Did I do somethin' wrong?<br> It's an emergency.<br> I'll see you some other time.<br> Not this one. In there, Doc.<br> - What's goin' on here, anyway?<br> - Will you please just get out?!<br> My shoes!<br> Some lover you are! Some sexpot!<br> Here. Find a phone.<br> Call your husband in Havana.<br> You bet I will! And when I tell him how<br> you treated me, he'll push your face in!<br> You fink!<br> Is she gonna be all right, Doc?<br> - How many pills were in that bottle?<br> - It was half-full. About a dozen.<br> - Do you have to take her to the hospital?<br> - Help me, will you?<br> - Into the bathroom.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> Get that stuff out of her stomach<br> if it isn't too late.<br> You'd better put some coffee on,<br> and pray.<br> (Fran vomits and coughs)<br> Bring my bag.<br> Roll up her right sleeve.<br> Hold that.<br> Nice veins.<br> Wanna tell me what happened?<br> I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.<br> You see, we had... some words earlier.<br> It was nothin' serious.<br> You might call it a lovers' quarrel.<br> So you went right out<br> and picked yourself up another dame.<br> - Something like that.<br> - You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.<br> Yes, you are.<br> If you'd come home half an hour later,<br> you'd have had quite a Christmas present.<br> (Kettle whistles)<br> Get the coffee.<br> (Fran moans)<br> Let's get some air in here.<br> Open the windows.<br> (Fran coughs)<br> What's her name?<br> Miss Kubelik. Fran.<br> Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because<br> you took too many sleeping pills.<br> Do you understand what I'm saying?<br> (Fran moans)<br> Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss.<br> I'm here to help you.<br> You took all those sleeping pills.<br> Remember?<br> - Sleeping pills.<br> - That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.<br> - Doctor?<br> - Dr. Dreyfuss.<br> Dreyfuss.<br> Get more coffee.<br> Now tell me again. What's my name?<br> Dr.... Dreyfuss.<br> And what happened to you?<br> I...<br> I took sleeping pills.<br> Do you know where you are?<br> - No.<br> - Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!<br> I don't know.<br> Do you know who that is?<br> Look at him.<br> Mr. Baxter. 19th floor.<br> Hello, Miss Kubelik.<br> Mr.? Miss? Such politeness!<br> We work in the same building.<br> We try to keep it quiet.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Don't you remember<br> we were together at the office party?<br> Oh, yes. The office party.<br> - Miss Olsen.<br> - That's right.<br> I told you we had a fight.<br> That was what it was about.<br> Miss Olsen. That girl<br> that was here earlier.<br> I don't understand.<br> The main thing is I got here in time and<br> you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?<br> I'm so tired.<br> Come on. Drink this.<br> Please... just let me sleep.<br> No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!<br> Let's get her walking.<br> We've got to keep her awake for the next<br> few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!<br> One, two, three, four!<br> One, two, three, four!<br> Left, right, left, right,...<br> ..left, right and return!<br> And... one, two, three, four!<br> Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!<br> Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!<br> One, two... And return again.<br> And... left, right, left, right.<br> She'll sleep on and off<br> for the next 24 hours.<br> Of course, she'll have<br> a dandy hangover when she wakes up.<br> Just as long as she's OK.<br> These cases are harder on the doctor than<br> the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.<br> - Any of that coffee left?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> How do you spell her last name?<br> Kubelik. Two k's.<br> What's her address?<br> Where does she live?<br> Why do you wanna know, Doc?<br> - You don't have to report this, do you?<br> - It's regulations.<br> But it was an accident. She had too much<br> to drink, didn't know what she was doing.<br> There was no suicide note or anything.<br> - I'm not thinkin' about myself.<br> - Aren't you?<br> She's got a family,<br> and there's the people at the office.<br> Can't you forget you're a doctor,<br> just say you're here as a neighbour?<br> Well, as a doctor, I can't prove<br> it wasn't an accident.<br> But as your neighbour,<br> I'd like to kick you around the block.<br> - Mind if I cool this off?<br> - Help yourself.<br> I don't know what you did to that girl,...<br> ..but it was bound to happen,<br> the way you carry on.<br> Live now, pay later. Diners Club!<br> Why don't you grow up, Baxter?<br> Be a mensch.<br> - You know what that means?<br> - I'm not sure.<br> A mensch/ A human being!<br> So you got off easy this time.<br> So you were lucky.<br> But you're not out of the woods yet,<br> because most of 'em try it again.<br> Well, you know where I am<br> if you need me.<br> Mr. Baxter! Open up already.<br> Oh.<br> - Mrs. Lieberman.<br> - Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?<br> What was going on here last night?<br> - Last night?<br> - All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!<br> - Army manoeuvres maybe?<br> - I'll never invite those people again.<br> What you get from renting to bachelors.<br> All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.<br> - And I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.<br> - Don't worry. He was out on a case.<br> I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter. This is<br> a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.<br> Come on, Oscar.<br> Operator, I want White Plains,<br> New York. Mr. JD Sheldrake.<br> Make that person-to-person.<br> Five, four, three, two, one...<br> - Let her rip!<br> - (Phone rings)<br> I'll get the phone.<br> Hey, Dad, why don't we<br> put a fly in the nose cone?<br> - See if we can bring it back alive.<br> - That's a thought.<br> Maybe we should put in two flies<br> and see if they'll propagate in orbit.<br> - See if they'll what?<br> - Propagate. You know. Multiply.<br> - Baby flies?<br> - Oh. Oh!<br> - It's for you, Dad.<br> - Thanks, Jeff.<br> A Mr. Baxter. Person-to-person.<br> Come on. Help me round up some flies.<br> - Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?<br> - Something came up that's important.<br> I think you should see me<br> at the apartment as soon as possible.<br> - What's this all about?<br> - I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.<br> But that certain party... You know<br> who I mean. I found her here last night.<br> - She took an overdose of sleeping pills.<br> - What?!<br> - What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?<br> - One of our employees had an accident.<br> I don't know why they bother me<br> with these things on Christmas Day.<br> Yes, Baxter.<br> Just how serious is it?<br> It was touch and go there for a while,<br> but she's sleeping it off now.<br> I thought maybe you'd like to<br> be here when she wakes up.<br> That's impossible. You'll have to<br> handle the situation yourself, Baxter.<br> - As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.<br> - Yes, sir. I understand.<br> She left a letter. Would you like me<br> to open it and read it to you?<br> Well, it was just a suggestion.<br> No, don't worry. I kept your name<br> out of it, so there'll be no trouble,...<br> ..police-wise or newspaper-wise.<br> You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,<br> so we were very lucky in that respect.<br> Actually, he thinks she's my girl.<br> No, he just jumped to the conclusion.<br> Around here I'm known as<br> quite a ladies' man.<br> Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.<br> Sometimes they try it again.<br> Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her<br> a couple of days to fully recover...<br> ..and I may have a little problem<br> with the landlady.<br> OK, Mr. Sheldrake. I'll keep her<br> in the apartment as long as I can.<br> Isn't there some sort of message<br> you want me to give her?<br> Well, I'll... think of something.<br> Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.<br> - What are you doing out of bed?<br> I didn't know. I had no idea<br> this was your apartment.<br> Here. Let me help you.<br> Oh, I'm so ashamed.<br> Why didn't you just let me die?<br> What kind of talk is that? You got<br> a little overemotional, but you're fine now.<br> Oh!<br> Oh, my head! It feels just like<br> a big wad of chewing gum.<br> - What time is it?<br> - Two o'clock.<br> Oh, my dress. I have to go home.<br> You're in no shape<br> to go anywhere but back to bed.<br> - You don't want me here.<br> - Sure I do. I...<br> It's always nice<br> to have company for Christmas.<br> - I'm stronger than you are.<br> - I just wanna brush my teeth.<br> Oh. Of course. I think I can find<br> a new toothbrush somewhere.<br> Here. Put that on.<br> - How about some breakfast?<br> - No. I don't want anything.<br> I'll fix you some coffee.<br> Oh! We're all out of coffee.<br> You had quite a lot last night.<br> Back in a minute.<br> Mrs. Dreyfuss,<br> could I borrow some coffee?<br> - And an orange and a couple of eggs?<br> - Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!<br> What you need is a good horsewhipping!<br> From me the doctor has no secrets.<br> Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?<br> I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...<br> You take a girl out just for laughs and<br> she thinks you're serious marriage-wise.<br> Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!<br> But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.<br> Who are you calling?<br> My sister, to tell her<br> what happened to me.<br> Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.<br> Just what are you gonna tell her?<br> - I haven't figured it out exactly.<br> - Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.<br> Suppose she asks you why<br> you didn't come home last night.<br> I'll say I spent the night with a friend.<br> - Who?<br> - Someone from the office.<br> - Where are you now?<br> - In his apartment.<br> - In his apartment?<br> - In her apartment.<br> - What's your friend's name?<br> - Baxter.<br> - What's her first name?<br> - Miss.<br> - When are you comin' home?<br> - As soon as I can walk.<br> - Your legs hurt?<br> - No, my stomach.<br> - Your stomach?<br> - They had to pump it out!<br> You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you<br> get the chewing gum out of your head.<br> They'll be worried about me.<br> They might call the police.<br> We have to be careful.<br> We don't wanna involve anybody.<br> After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.<br> Thanks for reminding me!<br> I didn't mean it that way.<br> I was just talking to him on the phone.<br> He's very concerned about you.<br> He doesn't give a damn about me.<br> - You're wrong. He told me...<br> - He's a liar.<br> But that's not the worst part.<br> The worst part is I still love him.<br> (Doorbell)<br> Oh. That must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.<br> Remember the doctor from last night?<br> That's his wife.<br> So where's the victim?<br> Max the Knife!<br> - Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today?<br> - I don't know. Kind of dizzy.<br> The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup<br> with chicken white meat and a glass tea.<br> - No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.<br> - Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.<br> You wouldn't have such a thing<br> as a napkin, would you?<br> - I have some paper towels.<br> - Beatnik.<br> In my kitchen, third drawer,<br> under the good silver, are napkins.<br> Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.<br> So, what are you waiting for?<br> A singing commercial?<br> - I can't eat.<br> - You must eat.<br> And you must get healthy<br> and you must forget him.<br> Such a fine boy he seemed<br> when he first moved in here.<br> Clean and cut, a regular lvy Leaguer.<br> Turns out he's King Farouk,<br> with the drinking, with the cha-cha.<br> With the no napkins.<br> A girl like you, for the rest of your life<br> you wanna cry in your noodle soup?<br> Who needs it? Now you listen to me.<br> You'll find yourself a nice,<br> substantial man - a widower, maybe -<br> and settle down, instead of<br> noshing all those sleeping pills.<br> For what? For whom?<br> For some good-time Charlie?<br> - (Door opens)<br> - Shh.<br> One napkin comin' up. Wish we had<br> some champagne to wrap it around.<br> - What did I tell you?<br> - Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.<br> - I'll wash the dishes.<br> - You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.<br> If he makes trouble, give me a yell.<br> - She doesn't seem to like you very much.<br> - Oh, I don't mind.<br> As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.<br> That anybody'd think a girl like you would<br> do a thing like this over a guy like me.<br> Did you find something here?<br> An envelope?<br> Yes. I've got it.<br> Don't you think we'd better destroy it<br> so it won't fall in the wrong hands?<br> Open it.<br> There's nothing here but a $100 bill.<br> That's right. Will you see<br> that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?<br> Sure.<br> Take this away, will you?<br> Would you like me to move<br> the television set in here?<br> - You play gin rummy?<br> - I'm not very good at it.<br> - I am. Let me get the cards.<br> - You don't have to entertain me.<br> There's nothing I'd like better.<br> You know. Togetherness.<br> Guess what I did last Christmas. Had<br> dinner at the automat, went to the zoo,...<br> ..then came home and cleaned up<br> after Mr. Eichelberger.<br> He had a little eggnog party here.<br> So I'm way ahead this year.<br> Three across. Spades double?<br> High deals.<br> Six? Eight.<br> I think I'm gonna give it all up.<br> Give what up?<br> Why do people have to<br> love people, anyway?<br> I know what you mean.<br> Queen.<br> - I don't want it.<br> - Pick a card.<br> What do you call it when somebody keeps<br> gettin' smashed up in car accidents?<br> - Bad insurance risk?<br> - That's me with men.<br> I was jinxed from the word go. First time<br> I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.<br> A cemetery?<br> I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.<br> His name was George and<br> he threw me over for a drum majorette.<br> Uh, gin.<br> That's 10, 20... 36.<br> And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.<br> I have this talent for falling in love...<br> ..with the wrong guy<br> in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br> Well, how many guys were there?<br> Three.<br> The last one was the manager of a finance<br> company back home in Pittsburgh.<br> They found a shortage in his accounts.<br> He asked me to wait for him.<br> He'll be out in 1965.<br> Cut.<br> So I came to New York and moved in with<br> my sister and her husband, a cab driver.<br> They sent me to secretarial school and<br> then I applied for a job at Consolidated.<br> But I flunked the typing test.<br> - Too slow?<br> - No. I can type up a storm.<br> I just can't spell.<br> So they gave me a pair of white gloves<br> and stuck me in an elevator.<br> And that's how I met Jeff.<br> Oh God, I'm so fouled up.<br> What am I gonna do now?<br> Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.<br> Was he very upset when you told him?<br> Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah, very.<br> Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't<br> have the nerve to tell his wife.<br> I'm sure that's it.<br> - You really think so?<br> - No doubt about it.<br> Would you hand me that pad and pencil?<br> - What for?<br> - I'm gonna write to Mrs. Sheldrake.<br> - You what?<br> - As one woman to another.<br> - I'm sure she'll understand.<br> - I don't think that's a very good idea.<br> - Why not?<br> - For one thing, you can't spell.<br> Secondly, if you did something<br> like that, you'd hate yourself.<br> I don't like myself very much anyway.<br> Pick up the cards. Let's go.<br> - Do I have to?<br> - You bet. I got a terrific hand.<br> - You really wanna discard that?<br> - Sure.<br> Gin.<br> (Hums nervously)<br> Spades are double... 154.<br> Blitzed. Two games.<br> (Sylvia hums along to dance music)<br> (Doorbell)<br> - (Doorbell)<br> - All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.<br> - Hi, Baxter.<br> - What do you want?<br> What do I want? Just a minute.<br> - You can't come in!<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> I made a reservation for four o'clock.<br> You can't stay.<br> Take your champagne and go.<br> I don't wanna pull rank on you,<br> but I told the little lady it was all set.<br> Are you gonna leave, Mr. Kirkeby,<br> or do I have to throw you out?<br> (Sniggers) Buddy-boy,<br> why didn't you say so?<br> - Got yourself a little playmate, huh?<br> - Now will you get out?<br> (Sylvia hums dance music)<br> Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?<br> Open up, will you?<br> (Dr. Dreyfuss) Mildred!<br> - What's holding things up?<br> - Say, let's have a party, the four of us.<br> No!<br> (Sniggers) Well, I don't blame you.<br> So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?<br> I mean Kubelik-wise.<br> Don't worry.<br> I won't say a word to anybody.<br> Stay with it, Buddy-boy.<br> Who was that?<br> Just somebody delivering<br> a bottle of champagne. Like some?<br> Would you mind opening that window?<br> - Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.<br> - I just want some fresh air.<br> It's only one storey down.<br> The best you could do is break a leg.<br> So they'll shoot me, like a horse.<br> Please, you gotta promise me<br> you won't do anything foolish.<br> - Who'd care?<br> - I would.<br> Why can't I ever fall in love<br> with somebody nice like you?<br> Yeah. Well...<br> That's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise.<br> Go to sleep.<br> - (Women) Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> - Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.<br> - Did you have a nice Christmas?<br> - Lovely. You were a great help!<br> Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik<br> at the office party.<br> - Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.<br> - I thought you could hold your tongue.<br> - It won't happen again.<br> - You bet it won't.<br> I'll arrange for you to get<br> a month's severance pay.<br> That's right, Miss Olsen.<br> I'm letting you go.<br> You let me go four years ago, Jeff.<br> And were cruel enough to make me sit out<br> there and watch the new models pass by.<br> I'd appreciate it if you'd be<br> out of here as soon as you can.<br> Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like<br> Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.<br> He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.<br> - (Baxter) Hello?<br> - Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?<br> Yes. She's in the shower.<br> - She's coming along fine, considering.<br> - Good.<br> - Is there anything you need? Money?<br> - No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> As a matter of fact, I have<br> some money for you. $100.<br> Oh.<br> - If there's anything I can do for you...<br> - For me? I don't think so.<br> But I was hoping maybe<br> you could do something for her.<br> Like what? Put yourself<br> in my place, Baxter.<br> How can I help her? My hands are tied.<br> Well... at least you can talk to her.<br> Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.<br> There's a call for you!<br> - For me?<br> - Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.<br> I don't wanna talk to him.<br> I think you should.<br> I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.<br> There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.<br> I'll be right back. OK?<br> Hello, Jeff.<br> - Yes, I'm all right.<br> - Why did you do it, Fran?<br> It's so childish,<br> and it never solves anything.<br> I oughta be very angry with you,<br> scaring me that way.<br> But let's forget the whole thing, pretend<br> it never happened. What do you say?<br> Fran?<br> Are you there, Fran?<br> Of course I'm not here, because<br> the whole thing never happened.<br> I never took those pills,<br> I never loved you,...<br> ..we never even met.<br> - Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?<br> - You know I didn't mean it that way.<br> You just get well.<br> Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.<br> I'll see you as soon as I can.<br> Goodbye, Fran.<br> Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.<br> Fine, thank you. I was wondering<br> if we could have lunch together.<br> I don't know how important it is,<br> but you might find it educational.<br> It concerns your husband.<br> All right. One o'clock,<br> Longchamps, Madison and 59th.<br> Don't worry. I'm on my way.<br> Just making a personal call.<br> Here's a dime.<br> Going down.<br> Oh, Mr. Baxter! I'm glad you're here.<br> - I was just going to get the passkey.<br> - What for?<br> I thought I smelled gas<br> coming from your apartment.<br> Gas?!<br> Miss Kubelik?<br> Miss Kubelik!<br> - You all right?<br> - Sure!<br> - What's that funny smell?<br> - Gas! Didn't you turn it on?<br> Yes, to boil water to get<br> the coffee stains out of my dress.<br> - You turned it on but you didn't light it.<br> - Are you supposed to?<br> In this house you're supposed to.<br> Hey, what are you doing with that?<br> I was washing my stockings,<br> so I thought I'd wash your socks too.<br> - Oh. Thank you.<br> - Very curious. I could only find 3 pair.<br> Things are a little disorganised<br> around here.<br> I'd say. What's a tennis racket<br> doing in the kitchen?<br> Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.<br> I was cooking myself an ltalian dinner.<br> I used it to strain the spaghetti.<br> - Why not?<br> - In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.<br> - Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> When I was straightening up the couch,<br> I found six hairpins, a lipstick,...<br> ..a pair of false eyelashes and<br> a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.<br> It's just that I'm the kind of guy<br> who can't say no.<br> - I don't mean to girls. I mean...<br> - To someone like Mr. Sheldrake.<br> - I guess so.<br> - I know so.<br> - He's a taker.<br> - What?<br> Some people take, some people get took.<br> And they know they're gettin' took<br> and there's nothin' they can do about it.<br> I wouldn't say that.<br> What would you like for dinner, huh?<br> Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...<br> I really should be getting home.<br> - My family'll be flipping by now.<br> - You can't leave yet.<br> The doctor said it takes 48 hours<br> to get that stuff out of your system.<br> How long does it take to get someone<br> you're stuck on out of your system?<br> If only they'd invent<br> some kind of pump for that.<br> I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You<br> think it's the end of the world. But it's not.<br> I went through exactly<br> the same thing myself.<br> - You did?<br> - Well, not exactly the same.<br> I tried to do it with a gun.<br> - Over a girl?<br> - Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.<br> And I was mad about her. But I knew<br> it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.<br> I went to a pawnshop and I bought a .45<br> automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...<br> - Do you know Cincinnati?<br> - No, I don't.<br> Anyway, I parked the car<br> and I loaded that gun...<br> You read in the papers that people shoot<br> themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.<br> I mean, how do you do it?<br> Here? Here? Here?<br> - Know where I finally shot myself?<br> - Where?<br> - Here.<br> - In the knee?!<br> Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.<br> A cop came up because<br> I was illegally parked.<br> I tried to hide the gun<br> under the seat and it went off.<br> - That's terrible!<br> - It was a year till I could bend the knee.<br> But I got over the girl in three weeks.<br> Still lives in Cincinnati.<br> Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.<br> Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.<br> Are you just making this up<br> to make me feel better?<br> Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.<br> - Do you wanna see my knee?<br> - No, thank you.<br> The fellas in the office might<br> get the wrong idea how I found out.<br> Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner<br> for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.<br> You just sit there and rest.<br> You've done enough for today.<br> - Yes, Nurse.<br> - (Baxter hums opera music)<br> - Can I help you?<br> - I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.<br> - So am I. She didn't report this morning.<br> - She didn't? Who's in charge here?<br> That comes under General Office<br> Administration. Mr. Dobisch, 21st floor.<br> Thanks.<br> So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and<br> guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.<br> - Who?<br> - Kubelik.<br> No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik<br> having a little toot?<br> Toot? More like a lost weekend.<br> Neither of 'em showed up for work today.<br> AWOL, hm?<br> What gripes me is<br> they guzzled my champagne...<br> ..while Sylvia and I wound up<br> at the Guggenheim Museum.<br> - Mr. Dobisch?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law<br> runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.<br> - Miss Kubelik?<br> - You know her?<br> Of course. We have a lot of employees,<br> but we're one big, happy family.<br> She lives with us, and my wife's nervous<br> cos Fran hasn't been home for two days.<br> That so?<br> So we wondered if somebody here<br> knew what happened to her.<br> I see.<br> What do you think, Al?<br> Can we help the man?<br> Why not? We don't owe<br> Buddy-boy anything.<br> Yeah. What's Buddy-boy<br> done for us lately?<br> Who is Buddy-boy?<br> (Hums opera music)<br> - Are we dressing for dinner?<br> - No. Just come as you are.<br> - You're pretty good with that racket.<br> - You should see my backhand.<br> Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.<br> - Shall I light the candles?<br> - It's a must, gracious living-wise.<br> (Hums opera music)<br> # Meatball<br> (Hums)<br> Meatball<br> (Baxter continues humming)<br> - You bought some napkins.<br> - Might as well go all the way.<br> (Baxter hums)<br> You know, I used to live<br> like Robinson Crusoe.<br> Shipwrecked, among eight million people.<br> And then one day I saw<br> a footprint in the sand...<br> ..and there you were.<br> It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.<br> - Do you usually eat alone?<br> - No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.<br> Or sometimes Dinah Shore<br> or Perry Como.<br> The other night it was Mae West.<br> She was much younger then. Cheers.<br> - Cheers.<br> - Know what we're gonna do after dinner?<br> - The dishes.<br> - I mean after that.<br> - What?<br> - You don't have to if you don't want to.<br> - Oh, I don't?<br> - We're gonna finish the gin game.<br> - So keep a clear head.<br> - (Doorbell)<br> Cos I don't wanna take advantage of you,<br> the way I did yesterday in bed.<br> - Baxter?<br> - Yes.<br> What's with you, Fran?<br> Did you forget where you live?<br> - My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.<br> - Oh! How do you do, Mr. Matusch...<br> - Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.<br> - Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...<br> It's none of my business<br> what you do. You're over 21.<br> - But your sister thinks you're a lady.<br> - All we were gonna do was eat!<br> If there wasn't a lady present,<br> I'd clobber you.<br> All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.<br> Want a martini?<br> How about some spaghetti<br> with meat sauce that I cooked myself?<br> Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.<br> It must be murder drivin' a cab<br> in New York with the cross-town traffic.<br> (Door opens)<br> Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?<br> Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.<br> Not you. Miss Kubelik.<br> - What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?<br> - This is Mr. Matuschka. He's... got a cab.<br> - Fran been sick?<br> - No. Just a little accident.<br> - What does he mean, accident?<br> - Well... these things happen all the time.<br> What things? What kind<br> of a doctor are you?<br> Not that kind! He just gave her<br> a shot, pumped out her stomach.<br> - What for?<br> - I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.<br> - Why'd you take sleeping pills?<br> - On account of me.<br> You?<br> Who else?<br> Leave him alone!<br> Oh, you fool. You damn fool.<br> - (Karl) Come on, Fran.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.<br> Goodbye, Doctor.<br> Well, I don't wanna gloat, but<br> just between us, you had it coming to you.<br> (Tuts)<br> You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.<br> Let me get my bag.<br> Don't bother, Doc.<br> It doesn't hurt a bit.<br> Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is CC Baxter.<br> Please tell him I'd like to<br> come up and see him. It's important.<br> Will you call me back, please?<br> Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.<br> All your troubles are over.<br> I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik<br> off your hands.<br> The plain fact is, I love her.<br> I thought you should be the first to know.<br> After all, you don't really<br> want her, and I do.<br> And though it may sound presumptuous,<br> she needs somebody like me.<br> - So I think it would be best all around.<br> - (Phone rings)<br> Solution-wise.<br> Yes?<br> I'll be right up.<br> Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.<br> All your troubles are over.<br> - Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?<br> - Hit by a swinging door?<br> - Or a yellow cab?<br> - That guy really must've belted him.<br> Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.<br> Those two days<br> she spent in the apartment...<br> ..made me realise<br> how lonely I'd been before.<br> But, thanks to you, I'm<br> in a financial position to marry her.<br> If I can ever square things with her family.<br> Good morning. CC Baxter.<br> (Intercom buzzer)<br> - Mr. Baxter is here.<br> - Send him in.<br> Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.<br> And I've got good news for you, Baxter.<br> - All your troubles are over.<br> - Sir?<br> I know how worried you were<br> about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.<br> I'm going to take her off your hands.<br> - You're gonna take her off my hands?<br> - That's right.<br> I've moved out of the house.<br> I'm gonna be staying in town,<br> at the Athletic Club.<br> - You left your wife.<br> - If you must know, I fired my secretary.<br> My secretary got to my wife, and my wife<br> fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?<br> Yeah.<br> Now what's your news, Baxter?<br> It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling<br> all right again so she went home.<br> Swell. And don't think<br> I've forgotten what you did for me.<br> This way, Baxter.<br> Sit down. Try it on for size.<br> - You like? It's all yours.<br> - Mine?<br> My assistant has been shifted to the<br> Denver office and you're taking his place.<br> What's the matter?<br> You don't seem very excited.<br> Well, it's just that so many things<br> have been happening so fast.<br> I'm very pleased.<br> Especially for Miss Kubelik.<br> I think she's the kind of girl that definitely<br> ought to be married to... someone.<br> Sure, sure. But first the property has to be<br> settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.<br> Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy<br> being a bachelor for a while.<br> Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch<br> in the executive dining room.<br> That's one of the privileges<br> that goes with this job.<br> You also get a nice little expense account,<br> use of the executive washroom...<br> Say, what happened to you, Baxter?<br> - I got kicked in the head too.<br> - Oh?<br> Good evening, Mr. Baxter.<br> Oh.<br> Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?<br> - I feel fine. How's your eye?<br> - Oh, fine.<br> - How are things at the apartment?<br> - Nothing's changed.<br> - We never did finish that gin game.<br> - I know.<br> I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.<br> Leaving his wife? Yeah.<br> I'm very happy for you.<br> - I never thought he'd do it.<br> - I told you all along.<br> - You were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.<br> - I guess so.<br> You were wrong about me too.<br> What you said about those who take<br> and those who get took.<br> Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.<br> I was using him. See?<br> Last month I was at desk 861 on<br> the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.<br> A panelled office, three windows.<br> So it all worked out fine.<br> We're both getting what we wanted.<br> Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?<br> No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the<br> truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.<br> - Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?<br> - No. You know how people talk.<br> I decided it was best not to see each other<br> until everything was settled, divorce-wise.<br> That's very wise.<br> - Good night, Mr. Baxter.<br> - Good night.<br> - Baxter, could you step in here a minute?<br> - Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> - There you are.<br> - Much obliged.<br> Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%<br> of females leave to get married and 22%...<br> Baxter, you work too hard.<br> It's New Year's Eve. Relax!<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.<br> - Naturally.<br> - I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.<br> - I finally talked her into it.<br> - I see.<br> The only thing is, I'm staying at the<br> Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...<br> If you don't mind?<br> - Don't mind what?<br> - You know my key to your apartment?<br> When we had that little scare<br> about Miss Kubelik,...<br> - ..I threw it out the window of the train.<br> - Very clever.<br> So now I'll have to borrow your key.<br> - Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> - What do you mean, sorry?<br> You're not bringing anybody<br> to my apartment.<br> - It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.<br> - Especially not Miss Kubelik.<br> - How's that again?<br> - No key.<br> Baxter, I picked you for my team because<br> I thought you were a bright young man.<br> Do you realise what you're doing?<br> Not to me, but to yourself?<br> Normally it takes years<br> to work your way up to the 27th floor.<br> But it only takes 30 seconds<br> to be out on the street again.<br> - You dig?<br> - I dig.<br> So what's it going to be?<br> - Now you're being bright.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> But this is the key<br> to the executive washroom.<br> That's right. I won't be needing it<br> because I'm all washed up around here.<br> - What's gotten into you?<br> - Just following doctor's orders.<br> I've decided to become a mensch.<br> Know what that means? A human being.<br> - Now hold on, Baxter.<br> - The old payola won't work any more.<br> Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.<br> (Doorbell)<br> - We're having a party and ran out of ice.<br> - Sure, Doc.<br> How come you're alone<br> on New Year's Eve?<br> Well, I got things to do.<br> - What's this? You're packing?<br> - Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.<br> Where are you moving to?<br> I don't know. All I know is<br> I gotta get outta this place.<br> Sorry to lose you, Baxter.<br> Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to<br> the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.<br> - Could you use some champagne?<br> - Booze we don't need.<br> Say, why don't you join us?<br> We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist<br> and three nurses from Bellevue.<br> No, thanks. I don't feel like it.<br> In case I don't see you again, how much<br> do I owe you for taking care of that girl?<br> Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.<br> I did it as a neighbour.<br> By the way, whatever happened to her?<br> You know me with girls.<br> Easy come, easy go.<br> - Goodbye, Doc.<br> - Happy New Year.<br> (Lively music and chatter)<br> Sorry I took so long<br> on the phone. We're all set.<br> - For what?<br> - I rented a car. It'll be here at one.<br> - We're driving to Atlantic City.<br> - Atlantic City?<br> I know it's a drag, but you can't find<br> a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.<br> Ring out the old year, ring in the new.<br> Ring-a-ding-ding.<br> I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.<br> Baxter?<br> He wouldn't give me<br> the key to the apartment.<br> - He wouldn't?<br> - No. He just walked out on me. Quit.<br> Threw that big, fat job right in my face.<br> - The nerve.<br> - The little punk. After all I did for him.<br> Said I couldn't bring anybody to the<br> apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.<br> What's he got against you, anyway?<br> I don't know. I guess that's the way<br> it crumbles, cookie-wise.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.<br> (All) # Should auld acquaintance be forgot<br> # And never brought to mind...<br> Happy New Year, Fran.<br> # And days of auld lang syne<br> # For auld lang syne, my dear<br> # For auld lang syne<br> # We'll drink a cup of kindness yet<br> # For auld lang syne<br> (Cheering)<br> (Horns and whistles)<br> Fran?<br> Where are you, Fran?<br> (Bang)<br> Mr. Baxter!<br> Mr. Baxter!<br> Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!<br> Oh!<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I'm fine.<br> Are you sure? How's your knee?<br> I'm fine all over.<br> - Mind if I come in?<br> - Of course not.<br> Let me get another glass.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Who knows?<br> Another neighborhood,<br> another town, another job.<br> I'm on my own.<br> That's funny. So am I.<br> What'd you do with the cards?<br> In there.<br> What about Mr. Sheldrake?<br> I'm gonna send him<br> a fruitcake every Christmas.<br> Cut.<br> I love you, Miss Kubelik.<br> Three.<br> Queen.<br> Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?<br> I absolutely adore you.<br> Shut up and deal.<br>
