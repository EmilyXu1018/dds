That's why we're here.<br> How come I knew that?<br> How come I knew that? Let me sit down.<br> I tell you...<br> How come I knew that?<br> I was just there. You're all here.<br> I was just there and you're here already.<br> She wanted it to come from<br> some portion of the church body.<br> She did? I see.<br> - She can't do that.

I follow.<br> Every step of the way. Yes, sir.<br> Amen. Lead me on.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Excuse me.<br> Do you have a hotel-motel around here?<br> A bed and breakfast, anything like that?<br> There used to be a motel called the Red Apple<br> Restaurant. I don't think it's there any more.<br> What's your problem there?<br> - Well, I set the points.<br> - What about them?<br> Well, I set them and I set the floater.<br> - But it's got to be something else.<br> - Screwdriver.<br> You've probably got a vacuum down there.<br> Let's see.<br> Your breaker plate's not advancing, see.<br> - See that tube?

Yes, sir.<br> How's it coming along, Sam?<br> You got that figured out?<br> Well, you had a small malfunction in your<br> distributor. We're going to fix it good as new.<br> That's great. Looks like we've found<br> a new mechanic. What do you say?<br> - I'm ready if you are.<br> - You serious?<br> If you are. Give me the parts, I'll build<br> any vehicle you want from the ground up.<br> - Where you from?<br> - See where I'm standing?<br> That's where I'm from.<br> I've got a little bit of everywhere in me.<br> Sounds like my first two wives.<br> You get around, huh?<br> Yeah. I've been to every state except for<br> Alaska, and a few foreign countries as well.<br> - Including Mississippi.<br> - Mississippi!<br> I'll talk with my partner. He knows more<br> about the cars than I do. Check you later.<br> Any of you know of a Reverend C Charles<br> Blackwell, might live around here?<br> - I think down that way, sir.<br> - This way?

I see.<br> - There you go.<br> - Yes, ma'am. Thank you.<br> - You don't have to get up. You're welcome.<br> In my dream, it appeared that I'd talk to you<br> about starting a church joint.<br> Talking never hurt nobody<br> so I thought we might examine the subject,<br> reflect on it, you know.<br> Yes. Well, pastor, I don't minister no more.<br> I'm in touch with some of my people<br> but most of them have joined<br> with other churches.<br> I see. Well, if I was to get<br> with some of those people<br> and they were willing<br> to start a new temple, small,<br> would you be willing to come<br> and help me in the community?<br> There is a possibility.<br> I don't preach no more.<br> I had two heart attacks in six months.<br> When I get up on that pulpit<br> and the spirits start moving in me, praise God,<br> I wouldn't hold back,<br> and I can't do that no more.<br> - Amen.<br> - I got to take everything a little calmer.<br> - Pray to God!<br> - But I'll pray on it.<br> You might consider it,<br> because I've set up temples all over.<br> Tell me something.<br> Why should I trust you?<br> Lord knows what you<br> could have been or done.<br> We got to look out for the Devil.<br> If he robbed you of your babies,<br> he could rob somebody here of their babies,<br> especially if he followed you<br> from wherever you come from.<br> Boy, I get it. Right on.<br> Now, you say God led you to me<br> and not to anybody else?<br> Yes, sir. I do believe that.<br> If he led you to me, I could accept that.<br> If he didn't, I'll find out. He's going to<br> let me know one way or the other.<br> If he did, I'd want to be with you, wouldn't I?<br> Then I'd be with him, right?<br> In other words, if he's leading you,<br> he got to lead me too.<br> You put that a lot better than I can,<br> that's for sure. Yeah.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> I'm going to keep my eye on you.<br> And the Lord keeps his eye on both of us.<br> And we all three keep our eye out<br> for the Devil, all right?<br> Hey, what's happening?<br> Good morning.<br> I'm Apostle EF. I'm here to see Elmo.<br> Hey, you. I'm Toosie. Welcome to KBBR.<br> I'll just buzz him for you.<br> He may be on the air at the moment.<br> - You can sit down.<br> - That's all right. No.<br> - Can I get you some coffee?<br> - No, thank you. Working hard?<br> Hardly working!<br> - They're slave-drivers, are they?<br> - Well, no. They keep me busy.<br> - There's lots of lulls, too.<br> - What you got, Toosie?<br> Mr EF's here to see you.<br> - The Apostle. Send him up.<br> - Just go on up.<br> I'll see you in a bit.<br> - It was good to meet you.<br> - Yeah.

What can I do for you today?<br> - I'll tell you.<br> I'd like to get on the radio to promote<br> a church I'm trying to get going for the Lord.<br> Have you had any religious spots<br> that you sold to preachers to air on?<br> - You bet I have.<br> - So, how did it work out?<br> I've had a number of preachers.<br> Some good and some not so good.<br> - How so?<br> - Well, some have been all right.<br> - Others skipped town before they paid me.<br> - Is that right?<br> So it's got to be a pay-before-you-pray deal.<br> That's what I tell everybody.<br> There haven't been many lately.<br> It's a pay-before-you-pray.<br> That's for those looking to pass through.<br> - I don't blame you.<br> - One other thing.<br> No fancy stuff. Only the King's English.<br> No speaking in tongues over these airwaves.<br> - I can understand that.<br> - What kind of preacher are you, anyway?<br> Well, I can preach on the Holy Trinity,<br> Old and New Testament, hell, resurrection.<br> You name it, I can do it.<br> I can preach on the Devil backwards<br> and forwards, anything, but no tongues.<br> That sounds good.<br> We'd have to get some money in here<br> while you got the word out over the air.<br> Absolutely, make ends meet.<br> - It's Elmo's place.<br> - Elmo, he's all over, isn't he?<br> He's something!<br> He's got his fingers in almost everything,<br> I guess.<br> - That's your house?<br> - Yes, sir. That's it.<br> Where did you learn about cars?<br> From my brother. He used to race them<br> out at Fresno, California.<br> Anything I know, he taught me.<br> My brother Robbie, he really is an expert.<br> That ain't no race car or nothing,<br> but that's it, right there.<br> Looks like you could get someplace<br> in a hurry in it!<br> It ain't going nowhere right now.<br> It's just pretty much sitting there.<br> - I plan to get it... It's got a 350 in it and...<br> - Looks good.<br> - Looks like you know what you're doing.<br> - I've been trying.<br> - I've been working for about four years.<br> - By the way, I'm the Apostle EF.<br> - People do call me EF.<br> - I'm Sam, EF.<br> - I'm not going to put you out, staying?<br> - I got plenty of room.<br> Don't even worry about that.<br> It's just me, so you're welcome.<br> I want to paint it black and everything, but...<br> Do you like it?<br> Lord, I'm not mad.<br> I'll never be mad at you ever again.<br> I know you're leading me.<br> You led me right to Sam.<br> He's a nice little fella. I know you love him<br> just as I know you love me.<br> So whithersoever thou leadest,<br> I will follow.<br> There she is.<br> I pastored here over 27 years<br> till my health broke down.<br> Where has everybody gone to? Your flock?<br> They're all spread out or gone on.<br> I don't know if you'd be interested in it.<br> It's just a thought.<br> I want it.<br> I'd fight ten men over it. I would.<br> Glory!<br> Let me tell you something. Hold on now.<br> Here's what I'm going to need.<br> All right, now.<br> Resurrection time.<br> I need about 29, 30 gallons of white paint,<br> five gallons of another colour for trim.<br> I need cement, glass, mortar, sand,<br> you name it.<br> And a fair amount of material for the roof,<br> obviously,<br> but we'll get her done.<br> I can get her done. Yes, sir.<br> It'll come out of my first two pay cheques.<br> Third, if necessary.<br> - There ain't no rent, 'cause it belongs to me.<br> - Well, bless you.<br> There are a few back taxes due, that's all.<br> Really? Well, I can get another job.<br> - I can set these churches up in my sleep.<br> - You move faster than any man I've seen.<br> When I was young, I'd tell everybody<br> I quit school because I didn't like recess.<br> I did, yeah.<br> Now, this is something here.<br> Let's see, now.<br> You got a good foundation here. Yes, sir.<br> Inside... You got no lock.<br> Hold on now.<br> I could do some shouting in here! Yes, sir.<br> This is a shouting church. I'm going to shout<br> something for the Holy Ghost.<br> Well, that'll do me just fine, if you're sure.<br> - I'm positive.<br> - That'll do me fine.<br> Bless you. You're a good man.<br> Glory be to God!<br> Praise him. Glory! Praise him.<br> Glory.<br> God bless you.

Lollipop.<br> Snow cones!<br> Good amigo, friend, Joe.<br> - Sonny. How's it going?<br> - Good.<br> - So?<br> - Horace ain't doing too good.<br> - Do you hold it against me?<br> - No way. I'd have done the same thing myself.<br> - I want you to be all right 'cause I love you.<br> - He's still in a coma?<br> The whole church is praying for him<br> round the clock in one-hour shifts.<br> The police have questions?<br> Maybe I shouldn't call you.<br> Maybe for a while.<br> They asked me a bunch of questions.<br> I told them I didn't know where you are,<br> which is the truth.<br> Joe, how come I haven't been able<br> to get hold of Mama?<br> I tried quite a few times and there's no answer.<br> I've been meaning to tell you.<br> Your mother's been in the hospital.<br> - I didn't know how to get hold of you.<br> - What's wrong, Joe?<br> I don't know, Sonny.<br> Something to do with her kidneys, I think.<br> What's the telephone number?<br> What hospital is she in?<br> I can't give you the number.<br> You can't be calling.<br> Them switchboards, the police is all over them.<br> - OK. Would you go visit her for me, Joe?<br> - I visit her every day.<br> - I will continue to.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm going now. I love you, son.<br> - You toeing the line?<br> - Yeah.

Maybe a year from now.<br> I'd like to do something for the fatherless.<br> When Satan robs you of your children<br> it makes you want to help others.<br> It all takes money. We'll get there.<br> It all takes time.<br> We'll create a little interest on the radio.<br> Elmo's going to plug us.<br> - And we have a newspaper, don't we?<br> - Yeah.<br> Extra! Extra!

Sell some tickets.<br> - Get some good publicity.<br> - Don't get so far ahead of yourself.<br> We'll show the community<br> that the Holy Lord is here to stay.<br> - Praise God.<br> - Can't get rid of him.<br> Lord.<br> I'm preaching like I'm going to war<br> this morning.

Glory.<br> - Sister Delilah.<br> - Glory to God tonight.<br> I'd like to give God glory for all he's doing<br> and thank him for being so real tonight.<br> I've been married twice<br> but both of my husbands have gone on.<br> But I dare to let that stop me<br> because Jesus lives in me.<br> Glory to God. Hallelujah.<br> Thank you, Jesus, for being so good.<br> I found this beautiful black penny<br> on the ground the other day.<br> The Lord said, "You have the power to call<br> the things that are not<br> to become the things that are. "<br> I said, "Lord, this penny is the down payment<br> on my house and my car. "<br> Glory to God! He's real tonight. Isn't he real?<br> He's real. Glory to God.<br> Oh-oh.<br> Equal time! Sister Johnson.<br> I praise God tonight.<br> I praise you for being in the midst.<br> And all the congregation of believers.<br> I'm saved tonight.<br> I'm sanctified. I'm Holy Ghost-filled.<br> I'm fire baptised.<br> My husband ran off with another woman.<br> Yes, he did.<br> I'm here to tell you if I ever do it again,<br> I'm going to check out his credentials.<br> He's going to have to be saved, sanctified<br> and Holy Ghost-filled.<br> - Glory to his name.<br> - Thank God and thank you, Sister Johnson.<br> Glory to God. Sammy?<br> Anything to say, Sammy?<br> I'm happy to be here.<br> And I'm happy<br> that everybody else is here, too.<br> Thank you so much. And now we have<br> Mr Elmo of KBBR. Mr Elmo.<br> Well, Apostle, I guess I'm thankful<br> that God sent you to my station.<br> I'm thankful that there were people listening.<br> I'm thankful to be anywhere!<br> - We're a good team, aren't we?<br> - That's right.<br> Glory be to God.<br> Yes, indeed. Elmo's very helpful in this area.<br> Brother George has been preparing something<br> on the horn. He's a wonderful musician.<br> He's going to play<br> one of these wonderful religious songs.<br> OK, George. Take it away.<br> It's all right.<br> Learn your ABC.<br> A, acknowledge that you're a sinner.<br> B, believe in Jesus Christ.<br> C, confess that you're saved.<br> Confess it to others.<br> Shout it in the hills and valleys.<br> If you keep your eye on Jesus,<br> he'll keep his eye on you.<br> As you can't escape the gaze of a picture<br> on the wall, his eyes will follow you,<br> the eyes of Jesus Christ.<br> Whithersoever thou leadest I will follow.<br> I am with you always. Everybody say "always".<br> Always!<br> Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,<br> Friday, Saturday, Sunday.<br> 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br> When I turn, he turns. When I jump<br> up and down, Jesus jumps up and down.<br> Somebody give me an amen. Somebody.<br> Glory. Glory be to God on high.<br> He backs me up here tonight.<br> Grab somebody, look them in the eyeballs,<br> say, "Jesus is here right now. "<br> Jesus the same yesterday, today, for ever.<br> Any time you think<br> the Devil's getting ahead of you<br> say, "Get thou behind me, Satan. Don't push. "<br> - Somebody say "get". Get behind me!<br> - Get!<br> The Lord don't want me drinking<br> because he's got his eye on me.<br> You can't hide the bottle<br> if he's got his eye on you.<br> The Lord don't want me to go dancing.<br> He's got his eye on me.<br> The Lord don't want me sinning.<br> He's got his everlasting eye on me and you<br> because he loves you and me.<br> How do we know he loves us<br> from now until the end of eternity?<br> How do we know that?<br> Because! Because! Because!<br> Because! Because!<br> Because he sent his only begotten son,<br> put him in a tabernacle of clay<br> so we could recognise him.<br> He came to save us.<br> He came to save us.<br> He could have called on how many?<br> How many? How many angels?<br> How many angels?<br> He could have called on 10,000 angels.<br> 10,000.<br> But he came to save us. He took our place.<br> He hung on a tree so we wouldn't have to.<br> That cruel tree.<br> He died so we could be saved.<br> It's free but it ain't cheap.<br> Am I right here this evening?<br> Glory be to God on high.<br> - Somebody give me an amen.<br> - Amen.<br> Glory be to God on high.<br> Let me ask you something.<br> - Do you want it? I know I want it.<br> - I want it.<br> Once you've felt 300 or 400 volts<br> of the Holy Spirit, you're going to want it.<br> Do you want to get plugged in?<br> Do I hear somebody say "amen"?<br> - Amen.<br> - You might get three in the one.<br> The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.<br> That's a mighty hot charged baptism!<br> If you want it, go for it. Be saved.<br> If God sent his only son, it's worth it.<br> - You want to be on the Devil's hit list?<br> - No!<br> - Then you'd better get on Jesus' mailing list.<br> - Yes!<br> Put all the elements of the Devil behind you.<br> Work on it.<br> Get rid of the combined satanic forces<br> and get right with God here tonight.<br> This ain't no petty subject.<br> This is the Holy Ghost power!<br> Get the Holy Ghost power<br> and the Holy Ghost explosion.<br> We're going to short-circuit the Devil tonight.<br> You Devil get behind me. You stay there.<br> You stay there. You stay there, Devil.<br> You stay there.<br> Oh, my, my, my...<br> We're going to be with Jesus tonight.<br> Oh, my, my, my...<br> We're going to be with Jesus tonight.<br> - Say, "We're going to be with Jesus tonight. "<br> - We're going to be with Jesus tonight.<br> Let those people on Pecan Island hear you.<br> We're going to be with Jesus tonight.<br> Sh... sh... sh... sh...<br> Sh... sh... sh... sh...<br> Look at these beautiful little hands.<br> Look at them.<br> Imagine a nail piercing the palm<br> of this child's hands.<br> Then picture the nails going in an old board.<br> If you were to take two boards<br> and nail them together?<br> I don't have that much love in me<br> to do this to my son. Do you?<br> I don't have that much love in me.<br> - But God does.<br> - Amen.<br> God does.<br> Bless you. Thank you.<br> Put your hand over your heart, with the other<br> hand reach out and touch somebody.<br> The Holy Ghost can and will enter you,<br> but there's another side of this issue.<br> On the other side of the Holy Ghost explosion<br> is a still small voice,<br> the still small voice of Jesus within you,<br> in your heart,<br> talking to you, leading you.<br> This powerful quiet force<br> can penetrate the most callous<br> and hard-hearted atheist you'd want to meet.<br> The only place that the still and small voice<br> of Jesus Christ can't enter<br> is into the heart of any man or woman<br> who says, "No, you cannot come in. "<br> "You cannot enter here... tonight. "<br> - I ain't going to say that.<br> - Lordy.<br> - Lordy.<br> - Amen.<br> I want every head bowed, every eye closed.<br> If anyone wants to come forward<br> and accept our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ<br> as his personal saviour, let him do so now.<br> - Once you're saved, it's a done deal.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Can you say, "I'm ready tonight?"<br> For any mother, son or daughter who wants it,<br> it's here tonight.<br> Jesus is here. It's a one-way road to heaven.<br> Jesus is waiting.<br> And the Holy Ghost conductor<br> is calling, "'Board! All aboard!"<br> d Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling<br> d Calling for you and for me<br> d See all the portals<br> He's waiting and watching<br> d Waiting, oh, sinner come home<br> d Come home, come home<br> d Ye go where thee come home<br> d Preciously, tenderly, Jesus is calling d<br> Sammy, my heart's broke for joy tonight,<br> Sammy.<br> My heart's broke for joy.<br> Come here, son.<br> You've come to accept the Lord Jesus Christ<br> as your personal saviour?<br> Are you ready to follow and accept him<br> at this very instant?<br> He's ready for you.<br> Saint Paul says any man<br> who accepts Christ as his saviour is a saint.<br> You're a saint here tonight, Sammy.<br> You're going to heaven.<br> I'm going to jail. You're going to heaven.<br> - I love you, son.<br> - I love you, too.<br> Glory be to God on high.<br> Let's give the Lord God on high<br> a big handclap.<br> We have a new member of Christ in our midst.<br> d... come home<br> d Preciously, tenderly, Jesus is calling<br> d Calling for you and for me d<br> Glory. We love you.<br> How many believe I preached here tonight?<br> - Yeah!<br> - Glory.<br> I'm going to have to leave you now.<br> Satan is calling me into the arena<br> one more time.<br> I may never see you much more again,<br> but I love you one and all.<br> I just want to say before I leave,<br> I've told you in the past,<br> some people get on the aeroplane,<br> they fly to Jackson, Mississippi.<br> Others fly to London, England,<br> some to Chicago, some to Dallas, Fort Worth.<br> But I've got my own little aeroplane.<br> Some day, I'm going down that runway.<br> I'm not going to Jackson, Mississippi,<br> to Philadelphia or London, England.<br> I'm going yonder to heaven and I'm going<br> to say, "Get out of the way, moon.
