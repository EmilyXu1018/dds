Come on in.<br> Sit down, Doc. Sit down.<br> Have a drink?<br> - Nothing to drink.<br> I got out of the habit behind the walls.<br> That's all it is, a habit.<br> Well, here's to the drink habit, the only one<br> I got that don't get me into trouble.<br> Well, Doc. What's on your mind?<br> I got a proposition. A big one.<br> How big is big?<br> - Too big for you, Cobby.<br> Now, wait, Doc. I don't like to brag,<br> but I'm doing all right.<br> Making book. I'm in the chips.<br> What kind of proposition is it?<br> A plan for a caper.<br> And it's a good one.<br> I could sell it for $ 100,000<br> on the open market...<br> ...but that would be throwing money away.<br> I prefer to execute it myself and make...<br> - How much?<br> Half a million dollars.<br> Maybe even more.<br> I will have to do a little checking,<br> as the plan is some years old...<br> ...but not much checking. Not much.<br> I need roughly 50,000 to operate.<br> Fifty thousand?<br> No, no, no. I don't see.<br> - Of course.<br> I thought maybe Mr. Emmerich...<br> What do you know about Mr. Emmerich?<br> Only what I heard in the walls...<br> ...that he has money to invest and that<br> the way to get to him is through you.<br> Lf my information is not correct...<br> - Correct, sure. Sure. It's correct.<br> I just never thought of Mr. Emmerich<br> in connection with this kind of deal.<br> Excuse me a minute.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Hello, Dix. What do you want?<br> - I wanna make a bet.<br> Well?<br> - Your man says you got to okay it.<br> What are you in for?<br> - 2300 and some.<br> Okay. Your tab's good for 2500...<br> ...but that's the limit. Either pick a winner<br> or pay me when you get that far.<br> Don't bone me.<br> I'm not...<br> - Did I ever welsh?<br> Nobody said you did...<br> - You just boned me.<br> I'm not asking you any favors.<br> I'll go get you your 2300 right now.<br> Now, Dix. Now, Dix, listen.<br> Will you have a drink? Come on.<br> Come on. Come back here.<br> Have a drink, will you?<br> Can you beat that?<br> Where does he come off, blowing a fuse?<br> - Who is he?<br> A smalltime hooligan,<br> who's crazy for horses.<br> My book beats him and beats him,<br> he keeps coming back for more.<br> Say, Doc...<br> ...I forgot on account of that big tramp.<br> I spoke to Mr. Emmerich on the phone.<br> He's gonna meet us later tonight.<br> He's giving a party at his house in town<br> for a bunch of swells...<br> ...but he'll be at another address later on.<br> A man like Emmerich has got<br> more than one place to hang his hat.<br> Smart cat. Never does a lick of work,<br> stays out all night, sleeps all day.<br> What's a big, dirty cat<br> doing at an eating joint?<br> I run over one every time I get a chance.<br> People feeding cats,<br> and some kids haven't got enough to eat.<br> You gonna buy that magazine?<br> Why should I?<br> I seen all the dames in it already.<br> Wanna make something of it?<br> You're a little off your beat.<br> - How do you mean, Humpty Dumpty?<br> I mean, you don't belong around here.<br> You're just passing through,<br> only not fast enough.<br> If I ever see you running over a cat,<br> I'll kick your teeth out.<br> I'd take you apart if you were about<br> a foot taller and straightened up a little.<br> Suppose you want your heater back.<br> Well, you ain't gonna get it.<br> How about that?<br> Quit kidding, Gus.<br> - I mean it.<br> Go on, get sore. Smack me down.<br> You know I wouldn't do that.<br> - Look, Dix...<br> ...take my advice and knock off for a while.<br> The happiness boys are on a rampage.<br> Headquarters has given them the push.<br> I can't afford to knock off.<br> - Oh, stop worrying. I'll stake you.<br> Yeah? I need 2300.<br> - What?<br> Something I just gotta take care of.<br> - Cobby, maybe?<br> Well, let him sweat. It'll do him good.<br> Cobby can spare a few pounds.<br> You can't owe money to a guy like him...<br> ...a little loudmouth who bones you<br> when he isn't even trying to.<br> I don't get you, Dix.<br> I just can't be in Cobby's debt<br> and keep my self-respect.<br> All right.<br> I got a grand put away.<br> You can have that.<br> Maybe I can dig up 1300 more.<br> I guess it's all right to owe me, huh?<br> - I guess.<br> Yeah. It's just my luck.<br> Well, I'll get it tomorrow or bust a gut.<br> In the meantime, stay away<br> from the boulevard, especially at night.<br> By the way, they knocked over<br> the Club Regal.<br> Wasn't that where Doll worked?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's coming in bunches, it looks like.<br> Go home, Dix. Stay home.<br> Don't get your flag at half-mast.<br> Remember, you still got old Gus.<br> Thirteen hundred? You must be crazy.<br> For Dix? What do I care for that hooligan?<br> I'd like to help you out, Gus,<br> but I got mouths to feed...<br> ...and rent to pay and all that stuff.<br> Why don't you wise up,<br> you wise guy?<br> You're a low-down scum.<br> A low-down, dirty scum,<br> to talk to me like that.<br> Look, Gus.<br> I guess I can make it, all right.<br> Yeah?<br> - Dix, it's me, Doll.<br> Doll?<br> Hi, honey.<br> Come on in.<br> Close the door.<br> - Well, sure, Dix. Sure.<br> I'm awful sorry to bother you,<br> honey, but...<br> Doll, if you're gonna smoke,<br> you gotta learn to carry matches.<br> Doll, what are you crying about?<br> Nothing...<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, Dix.<br> I don't know what I was thinking about,<br> bothering you at this time of the night.<br> I'll just run along.<br> Gus told me the Club Regal<br> got knocked over.<br> Yeah. Can you imagine, raiding the Regal?<br> The cops must have all gone crazy.<br> So it's a clip joint. So what?<br> And it would have to happen on pay night.<br> How about a drink?<br> - Hey, don't care if I do.<br> One of my eyelashes is coming off.<br> Were you locked out of your room?<br> How'd you guess?<br> Here's how.<br> Dix, if it wouldn't be too much trouble,<br> could I stay here a couple of days?<br> Just a day or two.<br> All right. Stay if you want to,<br> but don't you go getting any ideas, Doll.<br> Everything is here, from the observed<br> routine of the personnel...<br> ...to the alarm system,<br> the type of locks on doors...<br> ...the age and condition of the main safe<br> and so forth, so forth.<br> Take my word for it, Mr. Emmerich.<br> This is a ripe plum ready to fall.<br> My friend, according to the boys,<br> all takes are easy...<br> ...but as a lawyer, I make lots of money<br> getting them out of jail.<br> Please, Mr. Emmerich.<br> Perhaps you know my reputation.<br> I've engineered some very big things.<br> That's a fact, Mr. Emmerich.<br> Doc here is tops.<br> Am I to understand you gathered this<br> information before doing your last stretch?<br> That is correct.<br> I was ready to begin operations...<br> ...and the cops grabbed me for<br> an old caper I'd almost forgotten about.<br> The Adelphia Finance caper.<br> You took them for 160,000,<br> didn't you, Doc?<br> A hundred and fifty-eight.<br> You really believe<br> there's a million in this thing?<br> Maybe even more.<br> - You mean by that...<br> ...that the take will be worth<br> half a million to us in actual cash?<br> You know as well as I do<br> that in no case will a fence...<br> ...give you more than 50 percent.<br> - That's right, sir.<br> Well, what are your main problems?<br> - There are three.<br> Money to operate, personnel<br> and finally, the disposing of the take.<br> No trouble about the first, eh?<br> Wait a minute.<br> This remains to be seen.<br> The helpers will be paid off<br> like housepainters.<br> They'll be told nothing<br> about the size of the take.<br> Sometimes, men get greedy.<br> Well, how many helpers do you need?<br> - Only three.<br> A box man.<br> Him, we pay most.<br> Maybe $25,000.<br> I got a guy for you. Louis Ciavelli.<br> Best box man west of Chicago.<br> Expert mechanic.<br> Been in some very big capers.<br> From what I hear, he can open a safe<br> like the back of a watch. Only, he costs.<br> Then we need a topnotch driver,<br> in case of a rumble.<br> He should get 10,000.<br> And finally, sad to say,<br> we need a hooligan.<br> Most of these fellas are drug addicts.<br> They're a no-good lot.<br> Violence is all they know,<br> but they are, unfortunately, necessary.<br> For a more or less reliable man,<br> I'd say 15,000.<br> Well, that's 50,000 in all.<br> How...?<br> How's this take to be handled?<br> Get in touch with the best fences<br> in the Midwest...<br> ...and deal with whoever makes<br> the highest offer.<br> Maybe no one fence<br> can handle the whole thing.<br> In that case, we deal with two or three.<br> Half a million, eh?<br> I...<br> I'm just thinking.<br> If I decide to go into this thing, I...<br> I, myself, I might handle the...<br> You, a fence, Mr. Emmerich?<br> Oh, no, no, Cobby. Not exactly.<br> But your proposition looks pretty good.<br> I'd like to see the most made of it.<br> Oh, I suppose a fella should stick<br> to his own trade...<br> ...but I know some big men that might<br> not be averse to a deal like this...<br> ...if they're properly approached.<br> Highly respectable men, I might add.<br> So why don't you let me see what I can do<br> before you look for a fence.<br> A few days wouldn't make<br> much difference to you, I don't suppose.<br> Might mean a lot more money for all of us.<br> Good. There's just one thing.<br> I dislike to mention it, but...<br> ...I've just come from prison and...<br> - Well, of course.<br> Cobby will be glad to advance you<br> anything you need.<br> See that you have a place to stay. Cobby?<br> - Well, you bet your life.<br> And I got some fancy phone numbers<br> for you too, Doc.<br> What's it like, a man of your taste,<br> seven years behind the walls?<br> Not too bad.<br> It's a matter of temperament.<br> I cause no trouble.<br> The prison authorities appreciate that.<br> They made me assistant librarian.<br> I'm afraid I wouldn't make a model prisoner.<br> After this job, it's Mexico for me.<br> I'll live like a king.<br> Mexican girls are very pretty.<br> I'll have nothing to do all day long<br> but chase them in the sunshine.<br> You've been very kind, sir.<br> - Good night. Good night.<br> Mr. Emmerich.<br> - Cobby.<br> What's the big idea, standing there<br> staring at me, Uncle Lon?<br> Don't call me 'Uncle Lon.'<br> I thought you liked it.<br> Maybe I did.<br> I don't anymore.<br> I had the market send over<br> some salt mackerel for you.<br> I know how you love it for breakfast.<br> Some sweet kid.<br> It's late.<br> Why don't you go to bed.<br> Some sweet kid.<br> Hello, Bob Brannom?<br> This is Emmerich.<br> No, no. I didn't call you to get the right time.<br> Listen, I've got a job for you.<br> No, no. Nothing like that.<br> I've got over $ 100,000<br> standing out on my books.<br> Come to my office tomorrow, I'll give you<br> a list of the people that owe me.<br> No, no, no.<br> Use the method called for<br> in each particular case...<br> ...and don't tell me anything about it.<br> All I want is results.<br> Easy, boy.<br> Easy, boy. Easy.<br> Hello. Who?<br> Oh, sure, Gus.<br> He's still asleep.<br> What?<br> Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him.<br> Honey. Honey, that was Gus.<br> He says you can come over.<br> He's got something for you.<br> Okay.<br> Coffee, honey? I made fresh.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> Hey, you sure were dreaming.<br> How do you know?<br> You were talking in your sleep.<br> What was I saying?<br> It was all jumbled up,<br> but I heard one word real plain.<br> You called it out several times.<br> 'Corn cracker.'<br> What's that mean?<br> Corn cracker.<br> Corn Cracker was a colt.<br> Yeah, it would be.<br> Yeah. He was a tall, black colt.<br> Yeah, I remember what I was dreaming.<br> I was up on that colt's back.<br> My father and my grandfather were there,<br> watching the fun.<br> That colt was buckjumping and pitching...<br> ...and tried to scrape me off against<br> the fence, but I stayed with him.<br> Then I heard my granddaddy say, 'He's<br> a real Handley, that boy. A real Handley.'<br> And I felt proud as you please.<br> Did that really happen, Dix,<br> when you were a kid?<br> No. The black colt pitched me<br> into a fence on the first buck...<br> ...and my old man come over,<br> prodded me with his boot, said:<br> 'Maybe that'll teach you not to brag<br> about how good you are on a horse.'<br> It's nice to hear you laugh.<br> You know something?<br> One of my ancestors imported the first<br> Irish thoroughbred into our county.<br> Is that a fact?<br> - Sure.<br> Why, our farm was in the family<br> for generations.<br> One hundred sixty acres,<br> Fine barn and seven brood mares.<br> It sounds wonderful, Dix.<br> - It was.<br> And then everything happened at once.<br> My old man died,<br> and we lost our corn crop.<br> That black colt I was telling you about,<br> he broke his leg and had to be shot.<br> That was a rotten year.<br> I'll never forget the day we left.<br> Me and my brother swore we'd buy<br> Hickorywood Farm back someday.<br> Growing up in a place and then<br> having to leave must be awful.<br> I never had a proper home.<br> Twelve grand would have swung it,<br> and I almost made it once.<br> I had more than $5000 in my pocket...<br> ...and Pampoon was running<br> in the Suburban.<br> I figured he couldn't lose.<br> I put it all on his nose.<br> He lost by a nose.<br> Drink your coffee, honey,<br> before it gets cold.<br> The way I figure,<br> my luck's just gotta turn.<br> One of these days, I'll make a real killing,<br> then I'm gonna head for home.<br> First thing I do, I take a bath in the creek<br> and get this city dirt off me.<br> What's the matter?<br> - Nothing, Dix. Nothing.<br> I say something wrong?<br> - No.<br> But, gee, this place is a mess.<br> It needs a good cleaning.<br> How can you stand to live like this?<br> Count it.<br> Count it.<br> - Don't have to pay the whole tab at once.<br> Go ahead and count it.<br> Why get sore?<br> There's no reason to get sore.<br> You boned me in front of a stranger,<br> made me look small.<br> I didn't mean it.<br> I shoot my mouth off.<br> Maybe I had a slight load on.<br> You know how it is.<br> No, I don't know how it is.<br> Look, Dix...<br> ...I made a mistake.<br> Don't you ever make a mistake? Sure.<br> Sure. Here, have a drink.<br> Here you are.<br> There you are, Dix.<br> You gotta play the horses the smart way.<br> Save your money.<br> The next time there's a fix,<br> I'll let you know. It'll be money from home.<br> Excuse me.<br> Oh, it's the Doc. Come on in, Doc.<br> Meet a friend of mine, Dix Handley.<br> This is Doc Riedenschneider.<br> You heard of him, I guess.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, how'd you like the whiskey?<br> Made in your home state.<br> Where is that, sir?<br> Kentucky. Boone County, Kentucky.<br> Best water in the U.S.A.<br> - Is that so?<br> Yes, the water makes<br> the whiskey fit to drink.<br> Well...<br> ...I gotta be going.<br> I'll see you around, maybe.<br> So long, Dix.<br> Big hick.<br> His money's all right,<br> but I wish he wasn't so touchy.<br> Maybe it's a point of honor with him.<br> A gambling debt.<br> Him, that hooligan? Honor?<br> Don't make me laugh.<br> He's a hooligan?<br> - Yeah, but a smalltimer.<br> He'll stick up cigar stores, gas stations.<br> And every cent goes to the ponies.<br> One way or another,<br> we all work for our vice.<br> What do you say, Doc?<br> How was your date last night?<br> The young lady drank too much,<br> but the evening wasn't a complete loss.<br> She talked more than if she'd been sober.<br> - Yeah? What about?<br> Your friend Mr. Emmerich.<br> - Emmerich? Now, look here, Doc...<br> There's half a million at stake.<br> I've gotta know where I stand.<br> Emmerich must put up<br> before I can hire a crew.<br> For him, it's nothing. A dead cinch.<br> The information she gave me<br> is that he's broke.<br> Are you crazy?<br> I've seen him operate for 20 years.<br> He handles only the biggest cases.<br> He's got two houses, four cars,<br> half a dozen servants...<br> And one blond.<br> - Doc, whose word you gonna take?<br> Mine or some dimwitted dame?<br> Yours, naturally.<br> If he's broke,<br> I wanna be broke the same way.<br> Lieutenant. Lieutenant.<br> That guy you saw in my office,<br> he's just passing through.<br> Shut up. I didn't see anybody.<br> How could I? I wasn't here.<br> Yeah, that's right. That's right.<br> Look...<br> - Yeah?<br> I came to tell you<br> you'll have to stand still for a raid.<br> You mean they'll haul me downtown?<br> - It's a short ride.<br> I thought you were a friend of mine.<br> Right now I've got one friend: Ditrich.<br> And Ditrich's out on his ear<br> if he don't make a showing.<br> Why me? Why pick on me?<br> - Because it's logic.<br> You're the biggest parlor in my precinct.<br> The citizens know it, the newspapers<br> know it and even I know it.<br> And Mr. Commissioner knows I know it.<br> - I just hate to have it happen, that's all.<br> I'm as sorry as you are.<br> - Look, lieutenant...<br> ...I've always given you<br> plenty of cooperation...<br> ...but you're hitting me<br> at just the wrong time.<br> Well, all right.<br> Close up tight.<br> Keep the place dark.<br> Don't answer any phones.<br> Thanks, lieutenant.<br> Thanks.<br> That copper, he recognized me.<br> How'd you know he was a copper?<br> - I can smell one a block off.<br> Don't worry about Ditrich.<br> He's on my payroll.<br> Me and him, we're like that.<br> Experience taught me<br> never to trust a policeman.<br> Just when you think one's all right,<br> he turns legit.<br> A Mr. Brannom is here.<br> - Oh, yes, show him in.<br> Pardon me, sir.<br> Mrs. Emmerich is not feeling well.<br> Yes, well...<br> ...send for Dr. Houseman.<br> - I already have, sir.<br> Good.<br> Tell her...<br> Say I'll be up to see her later.<br> Well, what about my debtors?<br> How many of them came through?<br> Not a one.<br> - What's that?<br> You want all the excuses?<br> I've got some beauts.<br> - It's as bad as that, eh?<br> Two or three may come<br> through with a part.<br> They promised.<br> - I don't want promises, I want cash.<br> Look, my friend, a private detective<br> can't go around threatening people.<br> I'd lose my license. Ninety-eight percent<br> of them you're gonna have to sue.<br> There's no time for that.<br> I gotta have money.<br> I've gotta have it this minute.<br> What is it, girl trouble?<br> Shut up, Brannom. That's not funny.<br> How's that?<br> Nobody tells me to shut up.<br> Sorry, Bob.<br> Bob, l...<br> I'm broke.<br> There. That's the plain, simple fact.<br> I'm finished. I'm bankrupt.<br> How could you let Angela take you?<br> - It's not Angela.<br> It's everything. It's my whole way of life.<br> Every time I turn around, it costs thousands<br> of dollars. 10,000 here, 10,000 there.<br> I gotta... I gotta get out.<br> I gotta get out from under.<br> And the irony of it is<br> that I've got an opportunity...<br> ...and I can't take it.<br> - Tough.<br> Bob...<br> ...I'm gonna hand you<br> the shock of a lifetime.<br> Did you ever hear of Doc Riedenschneider?<br> Sure. Behind the walls, isn't he?<br> No, he's out. He got out last week.<br> Cobby brought him to me.<br> He's got a plan, beautifully worked out...<br> ...for the biggest caper ever to be pulled<br> in the Middle West.<br> Only, he wants $50,000 backing.<br> Who would be taken?<br> Belletier's.<br> The rocks alone would be worth,<br> conservatively speaking, half a million.<br> How much would you get out of it?<br> - A third of the take.<br> Brother. You're knocking me out.<br> What if I were to tell you that I've got<br> a plan worked out to get it all?<br> I could tell them that I'd fence<br> the stuff myself, you see?<br> Promise them cash on delivery.<br> Then...<br> ...when the time comes,<br> I simply wouldn't have the cash.<br> I'd tell them it'd take<br> a few days more to raise it.<br> I'm certain I could get them to leave<br> the stuff with me while we're waiting.<br> Go on.<br> - Well, then I'd disappear.<br> I'd take a plane to another country,<br> to another life.<br> The gold and platinum I could melt up<br> and sell as bullion, you see.<br> And the rocks, sell them one at a time.<br> There'd be no hurry.<br> They'd last a lifetime.<br> How wrong can a guy be?<br> Here I was worrying about your nerves...<br> ...and you were dreaming up<br> a double-cross like this.<br> Yes.<br> But I can't do it,<br> because I haven't got $50,000.<br> I can tell you how to raise it.<br> You? How?<br> What's in it for me?<br> - Fifty-fifty.<br> Okay.<br> But we may get ourselves killed,<br> my friend.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Well, how do we raise the money?<br> - Simple. Cobby.<br> Cobby.<br> - Believe me.<br> He can dig it up without half-trying.<br> Yes.<br> But what do we tell him?<br> Why do I need money?<br> Leave it to me. Cobby wants to feel big.<br> Here's his chance.<br> Advancing money<br> for the great Alonzo P. Emmerich.<br> He'll do it.<br> He'll sweat, but he'll do it.<br> What boxes have you opened?<br> Cannonball, double door,<br> even a few fire chests. All of them.<br> Can you open a vault with a time lock?<br> - Sure.<br> What do you use, lock or seam?<br> - Seam.<br> Ever taken one?<br> Remember the Shafter job?<br> - Yes, I heard about it behind the walls.<br> It was a good score.<br> Who supplies your soup?<br> - I thrash it myself.<br> How are you as a picklock?<br> - I can open anything in four minutes.<br> He'll do.<br> - You're in.<br> Not so fast. What's the cut?<br> No cut. You get a flat guarantee.<br> I want 30,000.<br> - 30,000? Now, Louis...<br> Twenty-five is what we figured.<br> All right, 15 down.<br> - Ten down.<br> Fifteen is satisfactory, I think.<br> There's your paymaster.<br> What are you sweating for?<br> Money makes me sweat, that's all.<br> It's the way I am.<br> Who are the others on this job, Doc?<br> - Haven't got them yet.<br> There's only one driver,<br> as far as I'm concerned. Gus Minissi.<br> Ask Cobby, he knows him.<br> Gus, 100 percent.<br> - Get hold of him.<br> He'll take the heat and won't flap his lip.<br> - Get hold of him.<br> Sure, Doc.<br> Any ideas about a hooligan?<br> I know a very good heavy. I haven't<br> seen him in some time. Red Traynor.<br> He's taking the cure.<br> - Rule him out.<br> What about Timmons?<br> Who's that?<br> - My doorman.<br> That busted-down wrestler,<br> are you kidding?<br> He's got nothing upstairs but solid knuckle.<br> I'm a stranger and do not know<br> as much as you gentlemen...<br> ...but what about this southerner,<br> this Dix?<br> He impressed me as a<br> very determined man...<br> ...and far from stupid.<br> Frankly, I don't like the guy,<br> but I never saw a hooligan I did like.<br> They're like left-handed pitchers.<br> They all have a screw loose somewhere.<br> I suppose he's as good<br> as anybody, though.<br> Gus thinks he's tops,<br> and Gus is usually right.<br> I like him. I say we take him.<br> Suits me. You're the boss.<br> Well, I better be getting home now.<br> Mrs. Ciavelli's worried about the kid.<br> What's the trouble?<br> - He's got a cold again.<br> She takes him out first thing<br> in the morning. It's cold then.<br> She claims a baby's gotta taste fresh air.<br> Like I'm always telling her, 'If you want<br> fresh air, don't look for it in this town.'<br> Here.<br> He's 9 months old there.<br> I must say, I envy you,<br> being a family man.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, always problems, huh?<br> One good thing about Dix,<br> you can get him for nickels and dimes.<br> Tell me something, Cobby.<br> It's your money, isn't it?<br> Not Mr. Emmerich's.<br> What difference does it make?<br> - None, really.<br> It's this way. Mr. Emmerich doesn't want<br> this transaction appearing in his books.<br> I'm not risking anything.<br> He's good for it in case of a runout.<br> Then you haven't got a worry.<br> No.<br> Where are you going?<br> - I found a place.<br> A girlfriend's leaving town.<br> She let me have her apartment.<br> The rent's paid up till the first of the month.<br> When did this happen?<br> - This morning, before you woke up.<br> I bumped into her on the street.<br> Remember that tall brunette, used to do<br> the novelty dances at the Bandwagon?<br> Blanche LaRue. It sure was nice of her.<br> I can't go living off you forever, can I?<br> I was glad to help out.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, maybe I can do something<br> for you sometime.<br> You don't owe me a thing. Forget it.<br> Well...<br> Goodbye.<br> How are you fixed for dough?<br> - A couple of bucks. Enough.<br> Here, take this and...<br> No. No, thanks, Dix.<br> I'm all through bothering.<br> Give us a kiss, huh?<br> Doll.<br> Yes, Dix?<br> Maybe I'll wanna get in touch with you.<br> Sure, my new address.<br> I'll be at 42 Merton Street.<br> Hello.<br> - Hello, Dix?<br> Yeah.<br> - Dix, this is Cobby.<br> Oh, hiya, Cobby.<br> - I got your number from Gus.<br> Yeah.<br> - Look, Dix...<br> ...do you want to get into something big?<br> I mean, real big.<br> If you do, be at Gus' tonight at 10:00.<br> Right.<br> Everything's here.<br> The soft spot's an old steam tunnel.<br> Manhole's on the corner.<br> You drop into the manhole at 11:45.<br> Dix will cover you.<br> You break through the wall.<br> It'll take about six minutes to get<br> into Belletier's from the furnace room.<br> Watch out for floor wires.<br> Make your way up the back stairs<br> and jump the alarm system.<br> That will take another three minutes.<br> At exactly 11:54,<br> Dix and I will come to the back door.<br> You open it for us.<br> I'll be waiting for you.<br> - Good.<br> Any questions?<br> Everything sounds okay.<br> - Same here.<br> Well, guess I better be getting home.<br> How's the boy?<br> - Oh, he's okay.<br> Ran a temperature yesterday.<br> Pretty high too.<br> We called the doctor, but temperatures<br> don't mean so much with kids.<br> He's back to normal today.<br> See you tomorrow night, 11:30.<br> - Good night.<br> Have you got a minute, Dix?<br> Sure. What's on your mind?<br> My friend, what do you know<br> about this fellow Emmerich?<br> You mean the big fixer?<br> I've heard his name, that's all.<br> I can talk to you, I think.<br> - Sure.<br> Mr. Emmerich is taking the jewelry<br> off our hands.<br> You sure are surprising me, Doc.<br> I don't exactly trust Mr. Emmerich.<br> Just a feeling. I may be wrong.<br> But it's up to us to collect, you and me.<br> Everything may go smooth,<br> but if it don't...<br> ...lf he's got it, we'll collect.<br> - Good.<br> We'll meet Mr. Emmerich after the caper,<br> deliver the jewelry and get our money.<br> The payment is to be immediate<br> and in cash.<br> After that, we pay off and scatter.<br> Don't worry, Doc. We'll collect.<br> Lon...<br> ...is that you?<br> Lon?<br> - Yes, May.<br> Come in, Lon.<br> I've got a business appointment.<br> - Sit down a minute.<br> It's 11:30. Isn't that rather late for business?<br> Lon.<br> - Yes, May?<br> I'm not feeling well.<br> You haven't been feeling well<br> for a long time.<br> At night, I get nervous.<br> And when I get nervous, I hate<br> to stay in this big house all by myself.<br> Look here. May, you're not alone.<br> There are three servants in the house.<br> All you have to...<br> - I know. Press a button.<br> Well, what do you want me to do?<br> Sit down, Lon.<br> All right.<br> Do I sit here and watch you<br> read a magazine?<br> Would that be so awful?<br> - Oh, now, look, May...<br> We could play cards.<br> Casino, like we used to.<br> - Some other night.<br> Please, Lon, just one hand.<br> I couldn't sleep last night.<br> Then I got to thinking of the old days...<br> ...how we used to like to stay up<br> and play casino. Just the two of us.<br> Yes. I wish I could stay, but I can't.<br> My dear, this is business.<br> I tell you what I'll do.<br> I'll look in later, and if you're still awake,<br> we'll have a little game.<br> Take your keys, please. We're closing up.<br> Okay.<br> All set?<br> - Yeah.<br> Better be careful how you handle this stuff.<br> They'll pick you up in little pieces.<br> What time have you got?<br> Good.<br> Good luck, Doc.<br> Did he give you the soup?<br> Here's the electric eye.<br> Soup.<br> It's gonna take a lot to blow this baby.<br> Here goes.<br> What's that?<br> - Keep going.<br> Hey, Doc, alarms are going off<br> all over the block.<br> The blast must've shook the whole system.<br> - What do we do?<br> I would hate to leave now.<br> We're so close.<br> I'm for finishing what we started.<br> - How about you, Louis?<br> It's okay with me.<br> - Will Gus hold still?<br> Don't worry about Gus.<br> What's the matter?<br> The drill broke.<br> We should finish before 12:15,<br> before the watchman gets here.<br> The store cop? Let me worry about him.<br> Hear that, Dix?<br> - Yeah.<br> Coming this way?<br> - From the river. Don't sound good.<br> Take a look, see what's happening.<br> We gotta blow, fast.<br> This is everything of real value.<br> Heavy, ain't she?<br> - Plenty.<br> This is the biggest one yet.<br> Wait till you see it in the papers.<br> Watchman. Pull open the door, Louis.<br> Maybe he'll go away.<br> - Do what Dix says.<br> Now.<br> Follow me.<br> Gus, take me home.<br> - Where did it get you?<br> Thigh. I can feel it going up.<br> I think I got the slug in my belly.<br> I'll take you to a guy, used to be a doctor.<br> - No, no. Take me home, Gus.<br> All right, Louis.<br> It's after 1.<br> They should be here any minute.<br> Unless there's been trouble.<br> Where is Angela tonight?<br> She's at her sister's.<br> She says.<br> I'd go easy on that liquor if I were you.<br> Half-drunk, I got better wits<br> than most people.<br> And more nerve.<br> You look worried, my friend.<br> Something bothering you?<br> Live and learn.<br> All these years, I've been suffering<br> from an inferiority complex.<br> I should've been in the money years ago.<br> You big boys, what have you got?<br> Front. Nothing but front.<br> And when that slips...<br> I do believe our guests are arriving.<br> Well? Everything go all right?<br> This is a friend of mine, Mr. Brannom.<br> He's been a great help to me on this deal.<br> Follow me. Follow me, gentlemen.<br> It's much more comfortable in here.<br> Say, I'll bet that thing is full<br> of Koh-i-noors and Grand Moguls, eh?<br> Could be.<br> Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.<br> Let me get you a drink.<br> - No, thanks.<br> Do you mind if we have a look?<br> You're entitled to a look, naturally.<br> Convinced?<br> - Why, of course. Of course.<br> There never was any doubt in my mind.<br> You know, I know this fellow's reputation.<br> Just a matter of curiosity, that's all.<br> I'll bet the appraisal is going to exceed<br> even your estimate...<br> Good. Good.<br> In that case, I'd just like to see<br> the color of the money.<br> Gentlemen, I must admit at this moment I...<br> I'm embarrassed.<br> You mean you haven't got the money?<br> - Oh, I have it.<br> That is, I have the assurance of it.<br> - You haven't got it.<br> No, I haven't got the currency<br> right here in my hands...<br> ...but it's promised<br> by an unimpeachable source.<br> Gentlemen, I'm afraid we were<br> a little hasty. We moved too fast.<br> We moved on your word.<br> Wait a minute.<br> That's a large sum of money, you know...<br> ...considering present-day conditions...<br> ...and considering the fact<br> that we had to have it in cash.<br> So I'm afraid a few days more<br> are needed to raise it.<br> A few days more may not seem like<br> a very long time to you, Mr. Emmerich.<br> But to me, carrying this around,<br> it would seem like years.<br> I understand.<br> I've got a solution for that too.<br> That is, if you boys trust me.<br> And if you don't, well, there's nothing<br> I can say except that I'm sorry.<br> Mr. Emmerich,<br> what are you trying to tell us?<br> About the jewels.<br> Wouldn't be safe for you<br> to carry that stuff around.<br> You mean, we leave them with you?<br> Well, when the police start looking<br> for that stuff tomorrow morning...<br> ...they're not likely to call me up.<br> They're not likely to send detectives out<br> to search my house, you know.<br> You, on the other hand, Doc, you...<br> You're just out of prison.<br> They're certainly gonna be looking<br> for the big-timers like yourself.<br> Some smart cop might even connect<br> this burglary with your release.<br> Well, there you are.<br> Of course, as I said, it's up to you.<br> Keep in touch with me through Cobby.<br> You did a great job, Emmerich,<br> but it's not working.<br> Bob.<br> Back away and keep out of this, Emmerich.<br> Now, you, farmer, get your hands up.<br> And you, Fritz...<br> ...throw the bag on the floor.<br> Over here by my feet.<br> Be careful how you throw it.<br> I got a pistol expert medal.<br> What do you say, Dix?<br> - He's got no say.<br> He makes a crooked move,<br> he'll never pitch another forkful of manure.<br> He's got us, Doc. Toss him the bag.<br> You're not as dumb as you look.<br> Are you a man or what?<br> Trying to gyp and double-cross me<br> with no guts for it.<br> What's inside of you?<br> What's keeping you alive?<br> Why don't you kill me?<br> What's stopping you?<br> - Okay, mister...<br> Dix, listen to me. Don't kill him.<br> It's too easy an out for him.<br> Sit down, sir.<br> Whatever possessed you<br> to pull such a stunt?<br> I was broke, facing bankruptcy.<br> He's a witness.<br> He saw me knock off that guy.<br> You think he wouldn't holler?<br> - He's in no position to talk.<br> What did you and your man on the floor<br> intend to do with the jewels?<br> Leave town.<br> Sell them off a little at a time.<br> No good. The police would have been<br> on you after the first sale.<br> You can't go peddling stuff like this around<br> when the heat's on.<br> Let's not fool around here any longer.<br> Be patient, Dix.<br> Mr. Emmerich got us into this hole,<br> and he's going to get us out.<br> I didn't save your life<br> because I'm a lover of humanity.<br> We're in trouble with<br> this satchel full of jewels.<br> As things stand, it's just so much junk.<br> There's nothing I can do.<br> - Yes, there is, Mr. Emmerich.<br> You can go to the insurance company.<br> Insurance company?<br> - They'll listen to reason.<br> This is a very bad jolt for them.<br> It's possible they'll be willing to buy<br> the jewels back, no questions asked...<br> ...for as high as 25 percent<br> of what they're worth.<br> Doc, let's blow.<br> I'll start on it tomorrow.<br> Get busy, Emmerich.<br> And remember, you might have been<br> lying here dead with your friend.<br> Shall I get in touch with you<br> through Cobby?<br> No. I'll get in touch with you.<br> Come on, Dix.<br> I advise you to clean up after your friend.<br> Don't give him any water.<br> - He asked for it.<br> I said, don't give him any water.<br> - Let go.<br> You wanna kill him?<br> Maybe he's hurt in the stomach.<br> Where's the doctor?<br> Why doesn't he come?<br> You said 10 minutes. It's half an hour.<br> Louis will die.<br> Why can't I take him to the hospital?<br> They wheel him into an operating room,<br> you'll never see him again.<br> Take it easy, Maria.<br> Louis is gonna be all right.<br> The doctor will be here,<br> fix him up good as new.<br> You and Louis are gonna have<br> six more kids.<br> All as fat as pigs, big black eyes,<br> lots of hair.<br> Just like Louis, eh, Maria?<br> Stay away from the baby.<br> Tell me the truth.<br> How did it happen?<br> I told you. A fight.<br> - Louis don't fight. You know that.<br> Why is it always you?<br> Whenever Louis gets into trouble,<br> you're around.<br> You dirty cripple. You crooked-back.<br> You have the evil eye.<br> - Shut your mouth, Maria.<br> I don't let anybody say that to me.<br> I'm sorry, Gus...<br> ...but I gotta blame somebody.<br> What I carry on my back,<br> I was born with it.<br> I didn't grow it myself.<br> Please forgive me, Gus. I didn't mean it.<br> Listen to that.<br> - Yeah. Must be a fire.<br> It's not in this neighborhood, though.<br> Someplace else.<br> Oh, Gus. I pray to God<br> that doctor get here quick.<br> He'll be here any minute, Maria.<br> Sounds like a soul in hell.<br> Dix, why don't you get in touch with Gus<br> and let him take you to the doctor.<br> Don't be foolish.<br> - I don't like doctors.<br> I'm getting along all right.<br> That bullet just ripped through my side<br> and went on about its business.<br> Good thing I jumped.<br> - How can things go so wrong?<br> How is it possible?<br> One man killed,<br> two others plugged.<br> I'm out 30 grand. We got a load<br> of rocks we can't even peddle.<br> Quit crying and get me some bourbon.<br> I must be awful stupid.<br> Here I am with a good business...<br> ...money rolling in...<br> ...I gotta get mixed up in a thing like this.<br> I ought to have my head examined.<br> Yeah, hello, hello.<br> Yeah, this is Cobby.<br> What?<br> It's Gus. Dragnet's out,<br> and they're combing the district.<br> He wants to talk to you.<br> You, Dix.<br> Gus? Dix.<br> Yeah. Listen careful.<br> Cops are knocking over joints along<br> the boulevard, meat wagons and all.<br> Now, look, I already called a guy,<br> Eddie Donato.<br> Donato's got a grocery down by the river.<br> Yeah. Thanks, Gus. How's Louis?<br> Louis is not so good. He got a slug<br> in his belly. Doc's doing all he can.<br> Here they are now,<br> the happiness boys.<br> Hello. How are you?<br> Looks like I'm in for a working-over.<br> Look. Go down to Eddie's<br> by way of the old car barn.<br> It's deserted at night.<br> You get beyond that, you're okay.<br> Cops never bother Eddie's neighborhood.<br> So long, Dix. Blow now.<br> All right, all right, all right.<br> What? Please talk a little louder.<br> This is Eddie Donato.<br> Oh, sure, sure.<br> I'll get Doc for you.<br> Hey, dottore, I got your man.<br> Hello.<br> Yes.<br> Fine, fine.<br> Good.<br> That will be satisfactory.<br> Cobby?<br> - Yes.<br> Emmerich came through.<br> The insurance people say okay.<br> Of course, we have to wait<br> till the banks open Monday morning.<br> But it's 250,000, which is not bad.<br> What's the matter?<br> - As a lawyer, you may be very brilliant.<br> But as a casino player,<br> you have a lot to learn.<br> You don't mind if I smoke, do you?<br> - Of course not, Lon.<br> Lon, how could you make a play like that?<br> You won't make a single point this hand.<br> Come in.<br> - Two gentlemen to see you, sir.<br> They are from the police department.<br> What on earth could they want, Lon?<br> Well, something to do<br> with a case, I suppose.<br> Excuse me?<br> - Oh, bother. We were having so much fun.<br> Hurry back.<br> - Sure.<br> Yes?<br> - Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Emmerich.<br> I'm Andrews.<br> This is Officer Janocek.<br> How do you do?<br> - How are you?<br> Well, what can I do for you?<br> Do you know a man<br> named Robert Brannom?<br> Brannom. Yes, of course.<br> What is it?<br> Something the matter?<br> There sure is, Mr. Emmerich.<br> His body was pulled<br> out of the river this morning.<br> Great heavens.<br> - But it was no drowning.<br> He had a hole through his pump.<br> He'd been shot.<br> Will you step in here for a minute?<br> Well, I must say, this is...<br> It's quite a shock.<br> Bob Brannom, eh?<br> Murdered, you say?<br> Great heavens.<br> We found a list of names in his pocket<br> written on your business stationery.<br> Who are these people, do you know?<br> - Oh, that's a list of my debtors.<br> Brannom was working for me.<br> He was trying to collect old debts...<br> ...without much success, I must say.<br> Was he giving the treatment<br> to anybody on this list?<br> Certainly not.<br> Then you don't think there's any connection<br> between this work for you and his death?<br> None whatever.<br> - When did you see him last?<br> Well, now, last Wednesday evening,<br> in this room.<br> Yes. We went over that list together.<br> The coroner says he was plugged<br> at 1:00 or 2:00 this morning.<br> Not much after the Belletier job was pulled.<br> We figured there might be a connection.<br> One of the heist guys was shot,<br> we know that.<br> There was blood on the floor.<br> Maybe it was Brannom's.<br> He could've died in the car,<br> they dropped him in the river.<br> Oh, no, no. Bob Brannom's a good deal<br> of a roughneck, but he's no criminal.<br> And if I'm any judge, Belletier's was<br> the work of bigtime professionals.<br> Oh, no, no, gentlemen.<br> Bob Brannom mixed up in any burglary...<br> ...why, that's inconceivable.<br> I see.<br> Oh, one more thing, Mr. Emmerich.<br> Just for the records, of course.<br> Could you give us an account<br> of your whereabouts last night?<br> Yes, I could.<br> Why? Is it necessary?<br> I'm afraid so, Mr. Emmerich.<br> Well, boys, a man of my years<br> hates to make an admission like this...<br> ...but a Miss Phinlay is living<br> in my cottage on the river.<br> And last night, I went to visit her<br> at about 11:30, I think it was.<br> Stayed rather late.<br> Oh, she'll verify this, of course.<br> Oh, but boys...<br> ...use a little discretion, eh?<br> Unless, of course, it serves<br> some useful purpose.<br> I understand, Mr. Emmerich,<br> and thank you very much for your help.<br> Oh, not at all. Thank you.<br> And say, if I can be any further help,<br> you just call on me.<br> Good day.<br> - Good day.<br> Hello, Angela?<br> - Yes.<br> This is Lon.<br> - Why haven't you called me?<br> Listen, baby,<br> you may have a visit from the police.<br> Is it your wife?<br> - No, no. It's nothing like that.<br> They'll probably ask you<br> some questions about last night.<br> Now, listen, baby.<br> I want you to tell them<br> that I was there with you...<br> ...from 11:30 until 3 in the morning.<br> That's most of the night.<br> - Most of the night, that's right.<br> Now, is that clear?<br> - Sure, it's clear.<br> Yes. Oh, no, no. Just politics, baby.<br> Good old dirty politics.<br> - All right. Call me right away.<br> Yes, I'll call you later.<br> - Don't forget.<br> Yes.<br> Can we go on playing?<br> Certainly. Why not?<br> Why, Lon, you're as pale as a ghost.<br> What's the matter?<br> Well, I just had some bad news.<br> A man who works for me got killed.<br> Oh, Lon, how awful.<br> Was it an accident?<br> No.<br> No. It was...<br> ...an intentional killing.<br> Do they know who did it?<br> - No.<br> Oh, Lon, when I think of all those<br> awful people you come in contact with...<br> ...downright criminals,<br> I get scared.<br> Oh, there's nothing's<br> so different about them.<br> After all, crime is only...<br> ...a left-handed form of human endeavor.<br> Ever been in Mexico City, Dix?<br> - Nope.<br> It's 8000 feet up.<br> The air is very pure.<br> Many first-class clubs,<br> restaurants, a horse track...<br> ...and girls.<br> Beautiful young girls.<br> How would you like to go there,<br> all expenses paid?<br> Sorry, Doc, not interested.<br> I'm heading home.<br> Listen, Dix.<br> You can always go home.<br> And when you do, it's nothing.<br> Believe me. I've done it. Nothing.<br> My mind's made up.<br> It's me.<br> Look, my friends.<br> My friends...<br> ...I am a respectable man.<br> For Gus, I do a favor, all right?<br> With this picture in the paper...<br> You mean you want us to blow?<br> Is that right, Eddie? Okay.<br> The sooner we get out of here,<br> the better.<br> Eddie's getting to the place where<br> he'd talk with encouragement.<br> Oh, no. I no talk.<br> Gus cut my belly open.<br> I'm sorry, my friends,<br> to bring you this bad news.<br> I go now, please.<br> - Sit down, Donato.<br> You're not going anyplace till I say so.<br> Stay put, Eddie.<br> Nobody's gonna hurt you, so long as you<br> sit still and keep your mouth shut.<br> The way I figure, the insurance guys sicced<br> the cops on that phony, and he spilled.<br> You never should've stopped me<br> from blasting him.<br> No, Dix. He hasn't spilled...<br> ...or they wouldn't be looking for just me.<br> - Then how come?<br> Because there's only three or four men<br> who can manage a job like this.<br> Somebody in the department with<br> a few brains has decided I'm the guy.<br> I've been half-expecting it.<br> It doesn't worry me much.<br> We'll get our money tomorrow, you bet.<br> I hope so.<br> Where are we going, Dix?<br> - I know a place.<br> Eddie, if you're a smart boy,<br> you'll forget you ever seen us.<br> I wanna see the commissioner.<br> - State your business.<br> I'm a citizen. I can see the<br> commissioner if I want to, can't I?<br> Is it about Riedenschneider?<br> - Could be.<br> He sure gets around, that guy.<br> About 5000 people have seen him<br> in the last 24 hours.<br> If you get in that line and wait your turn,<br> you can tell your story.<br> I won't tell anybody but the commissioner.<br> - Okay. Sit down and wait, buddy.<br> But it may be some time.<br> - Okay.<br> I'd like to see the commissioner.<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> We're on our way home.<br> - Yeah?<br> Where do you live?<br> - South on Camden.<br> You got no business here.<br> This is city property. There are signs.<br> Everybody uses it.<br> - You're telling me.<br> Even hoodlums have been<br> bringing girls here.<br> Is that a fact?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's cost one of our boys his job,<br> on account of the beefs.<br> If I were you, I'd stay out of here.<br> You understand?<br> Okay, officer.<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> You, with the bag.<br> Come here.<br> Dix.<br> Oh, Dix, honey.<br> You'll have to excuse me.<br> I took a couple of sleeping pills,<br> and I guess I'm still kind of groggy.<br> I haven't been able<br> to sleep much lately, Dix...<br> ...worrying about you and everything.<br> I was up at your place.<br> They told me the cops were after you.<br> Get me some cold water<br> and some towels and stop yapping.<br> Sure, Dix. Sure.<br> Get a move on.<br> - Oh, you bet.<br> Put in hours and hours of planning.<br> Figure everything down<br> to the last detail. Then what?<br> Burglar alarms start going off<br> all over the place for no sensible reason.<br> A gun fires of its own accord,<br> and a man is shot.<br> A broken-down old harness bull,<br> no good for anything but chasing kids...<br> ...has to trip over us.<br> Blind accident.<br> What can you do against blind accident?<br> One thing I ought to have<br> figured was Emmerich.<br> I know why I didn't.<br> I'm not kidding myself.<br> It was the extra dough he promised.<br> I got hungry.<br> Greed made me blind.<br> Hey, Dix. Dix, isn't he the one<br> with the reward on him?<br> Mind your own business.<br> She confirmed what Emmerich said,<br> that he was with her from 11:30 till 3.<br> How did she impress you?<br> - Very much.<br> She's some babe.<br> - That's not what I mean.<br> Was her manner straightforward?<br> Oh, I guess she was<br> telling the truth, all right.<br> Married 20 years,<br> consorting with a woman...<br> ...young enough to be his granddaughter.<br> It's disgusting.<br> But nothing about Emmerich<br> would surprise me.<br> Educated man who uses brains<br> to circumvent the law.<br> Worst type of human being.<br> No excuse for him.<br> Excuse me, commissioner.<br> - Well?<br> There's a taxi driver been waiting outside.<br> Says he's got some important information.<br> - Concerning what?<br> I tried to find out, but he<br> wouldn't talk to anyone but you.<br> He's been waiting two hours.<br> All right, send him in.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What's your name?<br> - Charles Wright.<br> Hackie number 14803.<br> Green Stripe Company.<br> What's this information you've got?<br> - That doctor everybody's looking for.<br> I think I had him for a fare.<br> - You drove him someplace?<br> Well, now, I'm pretty sure it was him I<br> picked up at the station a week ago Friday.<br> Friday the 16th?<br> Where did you take him?<br> To a number on Camden West.<br> I remember I asked him<br> if he wanted me to wait.<br> I know a fella that got<br> rolled once on Camden West.<br> He didn't have nothing,<br> so they stole his pants.<br> Where did you take him?<br> What number?<br> It was dark.<br> What's that number again?<br> - 4717.<br> Used to be a bookie joint, commissioner.<br> Get hold of Lieutenant Ditrich.<br> Yeah, that's him.<br> At first I thought I was making<br> a fool of myself by coming down here.<br> But that's him, all right.<br> You may be in for a reward.<br> I hope so.<br> Lieutenant Ditrich on one.<br> Where are you, Ditrich?<br> - I'm at 4th Street and 6th.<br> All right. Now, get a search warrant<br> and go to 4717 Camden West.<br> Riedenschneider was seen there.<br> - That's 4717?<br> Yeah.<br> Stake your men out before<br> you go in. Get a move on.<br> Some news just came in.<br> A patrolman was on duty at the car barn.<br> He ran into two men and was slugged.<br> They got away, but he identified one<br> as Riedenschneider.<br> Good. Great.<br> We'll block off the whole area.<br> No sirens. We'll make it a sneak.<br> How about the patrolman? Badly hurt?<br> A head wound and he's punchy.<br> The doctor doesn't think he's got a fracture.<br> Well, son, looks like maybe<br> we're getting somewhere at last.<br> Look, lieutenant,<br> what would I know about Belletier's?<br> I wouldn't mix into a robbery.<br> You know that.<br> Wouldn't you?<br> - No, of course not.<br> You saw Riedenschneider here, sure.<br> That don't say...<br> - You're nuts.<br> Never seen anybody here.<br> How could I?<br> I never been here before this.<br> Well, that being the case...<br> ...what's to connect me<br> with the Belletier job?<br> Somebody saw him here.<br> I don't know who.<br> Maybe you got a fink around.<br> Look. You're sure you<br> won't have one, lieutenant?<br> No, thanks.<br> I never drink while on duty.<br> It's against regulations.<br> Look, I got nothing to hide.<br> Riedenschneider holed up here.<br> He was broke.<br> I let him use one of the rooms<br> for a couple days.<br> I got tired of having him around.<br> I gave him a few bucks to get rid of him.<br> Where did he go?<br> - I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> Look, Cobby, do you figure me<br> for a pal, or don't you?<br> I sure do, lieutenant.<br> Then take my advice and turn state's.<br> We'll make a deal with the commissioner.<br> You won't get more than a year or two.<br> - Look, I'm clean.<br> I don't know where he went.<br> That's the truth.<br> They won't believe you at headquarters.<br> When you tell them that,<br> they'd work you over.<br> You ain't the type that can take it.<br> You'd spill your guts in a half-hour.<br> Give me a break.<br> You came to make a pinch, sure.<br> But I'm not here.<br> I had to go to Chi on business.<br> You're right here, Cobby.<br> I've always treated you right, lieutenant.<br> Let me duck out.<br> You can get away with it.<br> - No, I couldn't.<br> The commissioner's mad.<br> He's out for blood.<br> And it's not going to be mine.<br> You're not gonna stop me.<br> You're gonna let me go.<br> You're gonna do that.<br> If you don't...<br> Yeah, I know.<br> You'll be a Grade A pigeon.<br> That's right. I'll tell them<br> you saw Riedenschneider here...<br> ...and didn't roust him. Why?<br> You'd have to explain<br> what you were doing here.<br> I'll tell them about the juice<br> you've been getting.<br> The only thing you're doing<br> is making me sore.<br> Once I start singing, I won't stop.<br> They'll jug you right alongside of me.<br> That's where you're wrong.<br> Even if they believe you,<br> it won't go too hard with me.<br> Because I'll be the guy that cracked<br> the biggest case ever pulled in the country.<br> You're gonna get hurt, Cobby.<br> - What, have you gone crazy?<br> Stand up.<br> I told you you couldn't take it, Cobby.<br> Here.<br> They'll call me a fink.<br> That's my boy.<br> So since I'm gonna be<br> busy with a lot of cases...<br> ...you might like to take a trip.<br> - Where to?<br> I don't know. The coast, Florida.<br> Anywhere you like.<br> Could I, Uncle Lon?<br> Anywhere? No fooling?<br> Yes. I think a change of scenery<br> might be good for you.<br> Wait. You wait right here.<br> I've got the most terrific idea.<br> Oh, Cuba. There, that's not a bad idea.<br> Imagine me on this beach here<br> in my green bathing suit.<br> I almost bought a white one,<br> but it wasn't extreme enough.<br> If I really went in for the extreme extreme,<br> I would have bought a French one.<br> Run for your lives, girls.<br> The fleet's in.<br> Oh, Uncle Lon, am I excited.<br> Look, Uncle Lon. Isn't it romantic?<br> Real palms and ocean and everything.<br> Who can that be this time of night?<br> See who it is, Uncle Lon.<br> Why are they pounding so?<br> I'm scared, Uncle Lon.<br> Well, young man,<br> you've got an iron fist...<br> Oh, hello, Hardy. Come in.<br> Well, there's a fire in here.<br> Come on in. You look cold.<br> I'm here to arrest you, Emmerich.<br> May I ask what for?<br> Complicity in robbery and in murder.<br> If I were you, Hardy,<br> I'd think up a few more charges.<br> You might make one of them stand up...<br> ...if you get an imbecile jury<br> and the right judge.<br> Get the young lady.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> It may interest you to know that your<br> friend Cobb has signed a confession.<br> Want to take a look at it? Here.<br> Okay, miss. It's a shame to bust<br> this door in, but here goes.<br> Haven't you bothered me enough,<br> you big banana-head?<br> Just try breaking my door,<br> and Mr. Emmerich will throw you out.<br> Afraid not, miss.<br> He's got troubles enough.<br> As a matter of fact, he's a dead duck.<br> Hurry up, Andrews.<br> Bring the young lady in here.<br> Do I have to talk to him?<br> Couldn't I just talk to you?<br> Come on, baby.<br> Get it over with.<br> And be smart.<br> Tell the commissioner the truth.<br> That's the only thing to do.<br> Come on.<br> Sit down.<br> Andrews, repeat the statement Miss Phinlay<br> made before you yesterday afternoon.<br> She said Mr. Emmerich was here with her<br> from 11:30 p.m. To 3 a.m. Last Friday night.<br> Is that the statement you made?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Was it the truth?<br> You better think before you answer...<br> ...unless you wanna go to jail.<br> - Jail?<br> For setting up a false alibi to keep<br> another from being punished for a crime.<br> Mr. Emmerich wouldn't commit a crime.<br> - He would and did.<br> Tell him the truth.<br> Uncle Lon.<br> - It's the only thing to do...<br> ...unless you want to be indicted<br> for obstructing justice.<br> What I said yesterday was...<br> Well, it wasn't exactly...<br> I mean...<br> It wasn't really the...<br> - Was it the truth?<br> No, sir.<br> You weren't with Emmerich, were you?<br> - No, sir.<br> You were someplace else, not with him.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> He told you what to say,<br> made you learn it by heart.<br> Answer me.<br> I mean, yes, sir.<br> I mean, I learned it by heart.<br> Get a new statement from her.<br> Have her sign it.<br> This time, young lady,<br> I want the whole truth.<br> Over here, miss.<br> I'm sorry, Uncle Lon.<br> I tried.<br> You did pretty well, considering.<br> What about my trip, Uncle Lon?<br> Is it still on?<br> Don't worry, baby.<br> You'll have plenty of trips.<br> Seems to be all wrapped up, Emmerich.<br> Oh, here.<br> Say, I'd like to telephone my wife,<br> if you don't mind.<br> Getting late. She might be worried.<br> Help yourself. But don't try to run.<br> You won't get very far.<br> Emmerich.<br> Stop. Stop.<br> - Come on.<br> You wait and see...<br> - Break loose.<br> You dirty fink. You're gonna<br> wind up where you belong.<br> You're gonna wind up in the morgue.<br> You wait and see, you dirty fink.<br> Home of the pigeons.<br> Fink. Fink.<br> Fire escape.<br> We're looking for Louis Ciavelli.<br> I'd consider it a great favor<br> if you didn't insist on going in.<br> Mrs. Ciavelli is, well,<br> I don't have to tell you.<br> If the father says it's okay,<br> Williams, it's okay.<br> Call the commissioner's office.<br> - The commissioner knows me.<br> Mention my name. Sortino.<br> - Thank you, Father.<br> 'Emmerich was a graduate of<br> the law college of State University...<br> ...and had practiced here<br> for over 25 years.'<br> What foolishness. Unbelievable.<br> He wouldn't have gotten<br> more than two years.<br> He even double-crossed himself.<br> How's your head, Doc?<br> Good as it ever was,<br> which isn't saying much.<br> You know, getting out of town's<br> not gonna be a cinch for you.<br> Oh, I'll get out, all right.<br> I'll take a taxi to the edge of town,<br> then have him drive me as far as Cleveland.<br> Sure you wouldn't come<br> along with me, Dix?<br> Keep it.<br> No, thank you.<br> If you won't come,<br> will you finance me?<br> I haven't got but 4 or 5 dollars.<br> Sure, I'll finance you.<br> How much you need?<br> I can get along on $ 1000,<br> thanks very much.<br> And you can have the rest of these stones.<br> That's $50,000 worth.<br> What would I do? Can you see me<br> walking into a hockshop with that stuff?<br> First they'd think they were phony,<br> then they'd yell for the riot squad.<br> No. You can have the thousand,<br> but no rocks for me.<br> Well, thank you, Dix.<br> Tell me where to write you. At least I can<br> send you the 5 grand you got coming.<br> What will your address be in Kentucky?<br> - Forget it.<br> Maybe I'll see you around.<br> Well...<br> ...goodbye, then.<br> - Goodbye, Doc.<br> Hey, wait. You haven't got a heater.<br> I'd let you have mine,<br> but you got a gun, Doll?<br> No, Dix. I used to have one around,<br> but I guess somebody stole it.<br> I don't want a gun.<br> I haven't carried a gun since my 20s.<br> You carry a gun, you shoot a policeman.<br> Bad rap, hard to beat.<br> You don't carry a gun,<br> you give up and they hold one on you.<br> All right, Doc. You know best.<br> How about a cup of coffee, honey?<br> That squarehead.<br> He's a funny little guy.<br> I don't get him at all.<br> Maybe it's because he's a foreigner.<br> They just don't think like us.<br> I gotta get out of town too,<br> before morning.<br> Anyway, he's got plenty of guts.<br> How about a cup of coffee, honey?<br> - Make it or shut up about it.<br> It's that wound.<br> - Bright girl.<br> Dix, it's starting to bleed again.<br> I know, aspirin.<br> Pickering Avenue and Center Street.<br> You know where that is?<br> The other side of town.<br> - How far is that?<br> I can make it in an hour.<br> - Okay. I got relatives living there.<br> I'm between trains.<br> I got nothing else to do.<br> I know how it is.<br> I got relatives myself, on both sides.<br> Always writing me letters for money.<br> I haven't spoken German for a long time.<br> You have a Mnchen accent.<br> - I was born there.<br> You know what they say,<br> 'Home is where the money is.'<br> Yeah.<br> - Franz?<br> Would you drive me to Cleveland?<br> - It's a long way, my friend.<br> But it would still be quicker<br> than to take the train.<br> What about your relatives?<br> - Forget them.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> Cleveland, that's a long way.<br> Costs a lot of money.<br> - There's a $50 tip for you.<br> What do you say?<br> - For $50, I'd drive you to the North Pole.<br> Well, we better get gas<br> if we're going to Cleveland.<br> Let's not stop.<br> Wait till we get out of town.<br> We can do everything at once.<br> Have a little meal, beer, a cigar.<br> Go in comfort.<br> You're a man who likes his pleasures.<br> Well, Franz, what else<br> is there in life, I ask you?<br> You've been gone two hours.<br> What happened?<br> It took time.<br> I was stopped twice, prowler cars.<br> The neighborhood's<br> crawling with coppers. Dix, you...<br> Did you get a car?<br> - Yes.<br> Here's the change.<br> It only came to $400.<br> I got it from Big Vivian.<br> It's in pretty good shape, Dix, except...<br> Did you put gas in it?<br> - Yes.<br> Where is it parked?<br> - Three blocks away.<br> Good girl.<br> - Dix.<br> Yeah?<br> - I'm scared.<br> All those cops out there.<br> They don't worry me one bit.<br> I'll drive slow. Head down<br> the main boulevard, and in 10 hours...<br> ...I'll be home.<br> How are you gonna drive all that way?<br> I'll make it.<br> - No.<br> Not in the shape you're in.<br> I'll make it.<br> - Dix.<br> Let me go with you?<br> Please, Dix. Please.<br> Are you crazy? I'm on the lam.<br> I'm wanted bad, packing heat.<br> What good would you be?<br> - I could drive.<br> No, Doll. I'm wanted on a killing rap.<br> I don't care.<br> I just want to be with you.<br> You can't go without me.<br> I won't let you.<br> I won't tell you where the car is.<br> I don't get it.<br> I just don't get it.<br> All right, kid. Get your things packed.<br> Come on, let's play some more.<br> I'm fresh out of nickels, Jeannie.<br> How about you?<br> I'm always fresh out.<br> - Well, get some.<br> You know, you can cost a guy<br> a lot of dough.<br> Nickels he's complaining about.<br> What a spender.<br> Sure, he wants a date.<br> He always wants a date.<br> And where do we go?<br> To a third-run movie.<br> Then we take a ride and blow two tires.<br> Then we come in here,<br> and what do you treat me to? Cokes.<br> That's for you.<br> - Thanks.<br> Would you have change for this in nickels?<br> - Sure thing.<br> At least you could dig for enough<br> to play me some music.<br> Jeannie, cut it out.<br> Excuse me, boys.<br> Young lady, I like music too.<br> Would you play me a tune?<br> - Sure. What do you want?<br> You pick them.<br> - Gosh, how many have you got here?<br> Not very many. Play what you like.<br> - Okay.<br> Mister.<br> Mister. It's getting late.<br> Mister, we better be moving along.<br> Plenty of time, my friend. Plenty of time.<br> Look, mister, it's a long way to Cleveland.<br> Well, I suppose we better go now.<br> Don't go. We haven't used all the nickels.<br> - You use them.<br> Thanks. It's sure nice of you.<br> - Don't mention it.<br> Goodbye and thanks.<br> Thanks ever so much.<br> Pleasure was all mine.<br> You men want something?<br> What do you think, Ed?<br> Might be the number-one boy.<br> Just might be.<br> - Say, what is this?<br> Shut up.<br> - Better frisk him.<br> Go right ahead.<br> - Put up your hands.<br> You have me mixed up<br> with somebody else.<br> I'm from Cleveland, the importing business.<br> My name's Kremper.<br> Nothing there.<br> Let me see that coat.<br> You're making a big...<br> - Shut up. Stay out of this.<br> Bill, better phone the city<br> and check on the description.<br> We don't need a description.<br> I'll tell them we got him.<br> Okay, mister. Keep those hands up.<br> - Of course.<br> Excuse me, officer,<br> but will you tell me something?<br> Maybe. Just keep your face front.<br> How long have you been out here?<br> That's a darn funny question.<br> - It's not important.<br> We've been watching you<br> through that window two, three minutes.<br> Yes. Say, about as long as it takes<br> to play a phonograph record.<br> How's that again?<br> What are you talking about?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> - Keep your face front.<br> You mind if I smoke a cigar?<br> Just stand quiet there, mister.<br> We'll talk about smoking a cigar later.<br> Certainly, officer. Certainly.<br> How you feeling now, Dix?<br> All right. Cold.<br> Didn't used to get cold this time of year.<br> Why don't you let me drive<br> for a while, honey.<br> You don't know the way.<br> I don't wanna have to keep telling you.<br> Much longer, Dix?<br> Dix. Dix.<br> Dix.<br> Dix.<br> Mister. Mister.<br> Mister.<br> You gotta help me.<br> I gotta find a doctor.<br> My husband, he's sick.<br> Come on. I'll show you.<br> Go straight on, ma'am.<br> Down to the end of the block.<br> We'll get Doc Swanson.<br> He lives right near here, on Elm Street.<br> My husband, he's sick. Save him.<br> Get him inside here where I can look at him.<br> Right in this other room here, please.<br> On the table.<br> Take his coat off.<br> On the chair.<br> This man's been hemorrhaging.<br> He's lost a lot of blood. What happened?<br> He was hurt.<br> He was hurt in an auto accident.<br> How long has this wound been let go?<br> - A couple of days.<br> Is it bad, doctor?<br> Is he hurt real bad?<br> It's not good.<br> You got a good, strong arm?<br> - Good as any, Doc, I guess.<br> Come around here<br> and hold this for me, please.<br> That's right.<br> There we are.<br> Hello. Let me talk to Tom.<br> This is Dr. Swanson. Well, wake him up.<br> I'm thirsty. Get me a drink of water.<br> - Sure, Dix. Sure.<br> Lie down, sweetheart. Please lie down.<br> Hello, sheriff.<br> This is Tom. I got a man here<br> with a gunshot wound. Pretty bad.<br> Here, sweetheart.<br> - Who's that?<br> I had to take you to the doctor's, Dix.<br> I couldn't help it.<br> Hold him? I don't have to.<br> The man's unconscious.<br> No, no, no. He's a stranger to me.<br> His wife's with him.<br> She says it was an auto accident.<br> Dix.<br> Dix. Dix.<br> Well, he won't get very far,<br> that's for sure.<br> He hasn't got enough blood left in him<br> to keep a chicken alive.<br> Any more questions?<br> - I don't like to harp on the same point...<br> ...but what about Ditrich?<br> If the past of the department...<br> He's in jail and he'll go to trial.<br> He'll be tried by 12 citizens.<br> The people he's worked for. Let them<br> show justice or compassion as they see fit.<br> What would be your<br> verdict, commissioner?<br> I'm not sure.<br> I'm not sure at all.<br> Let me put it this way.<br> It's not anything strange that there<br> are corrupt officers in police departments.<br> The dirt they're trying to clean up<br> is bound to rub off on some, but not all.<br> Maybe one out of 100.<br> The other 99 are honest men<br> trying to do an honest job.<br> Robbery at 193 Scully Avenue.<br> - Listen.<br> All units, robbery at 193...<br> ...two male Caucasians,<br> armed with blue steel...<br> I know you're police reporters<br> and hear this all day...<br> ...but listen with your conscience,<br> not just your ears.<br> wearing a brown felt hat...<br> ...a shooting at 25 James Boulevard.<br> Woman screaming.<br> Car 12, shooting at<br> All units, strong-arm slugging,<br> We send police assistance<br> to each of those calls...<br> ...because they're not just codes<br> on a radio, they're cries for help.<br> People are being cheated,<br> robbed, murdered, raped.<br> And that goes on 24 hours a day,<br> every day in the year.<br> And that's not exceptional, that's usual.<br> It's the same in every city<br> of the modern world.<br> But suppose we had no police force,<br> good or bad.<br> Suppose we had...<br> ...just silence.<br> Nobody to listen. Nobody to answer.<br> The battle's finished.<br> The jungle wins.<br> The predatory beasts take over.<br> Think about it.<br> Well, gentlemen...<br> ...three men are in jail, three men dead, one<br> by his own hand. One man's a fugitive...<br> ...and we have reason to believe<br> seriously wounded.<br> That's six out of seven. Not bad.<br> And we'll get the last one too.<br> In some ways,<br> he's the most dangerous of them all.<br> A hardened killer. A hooligan.<br> A man without human feeling<br> or human mercy.<br> I tell you...<br> ...the black one's the best<br> we ever had at Hickorywood.<br> The bay's all right, but...<br> ...the black's a real good colt.<br> Prettiest way of...<br> Going of... Anything...<br> ...Pa ever bred.<br> Easiest thing...<br> ...but he's always way out front...<br> ...of the other yearlings.<br> He's a stake horse...<br> ...or I never saw one.<br> I sure hope...<br> ...Pa don't sell him.<br> If Pa just hangs on to that black colt...<br> ...everything's gonna be all right.<br> - Oh, Dix. God.<br> I said it.<br> I'll say it again.<br> If Pa just hangs on to that black colt...<br> ...everything's gonna be okay.<br> What's this...?<br> Oh, Dix.<br> Dix. Dix.<br> Oh, God. Oh, my God, Dix.<br> Dix.<br>
