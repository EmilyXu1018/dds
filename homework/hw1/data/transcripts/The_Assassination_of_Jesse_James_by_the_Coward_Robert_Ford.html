You just slide them things<br> right in there, right in your sleeve...<br> ...and then, when you get ready,<br> you just shake it out.<br> Like that, right there. You shake it out.<br> Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, fall<br> into hysterics when the moon was full.<br> President's men would tie her up<br> with hay-baling wire...<br> ...keep her from ripping<br> her husband's ears off.<br> You never heard word one about the wife of<br> the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?<br> - I didn't.<br> - No, you didn't.<br> He did his duty by her.<br> - Oh, my God, I'm speaking to children.<br> - No, I get it, I get it, I get it.<br> The president of the Confederacy discerned<br> his wife's needs and satisfied them...<br> ...with the utmost skill<br> and the utmost courtesy.<br> - Charley, you spit all over my boot.<br> - Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.<br> - Here, get it off.<br> - I'll wipe it... I'll wipe it off.<br> But Abraham Lincoln probably<br> sent his wife on a shopping expedition.<br> - A three-act play.<br> - With money stole from us.<br> Chow!<br> I think insanity run on both sides<br> of that Lincoln family.<br> You're right about that.<br> The river... You jump in the river.<br> - Chow!<br> - Don't be shy now, Dick.<br> - One more piece of meat.<br> - When you diddle a lot...<br> There's a good piece of bacon fat<br> in there for him.<br> Excuse me.<br> I see I've traipsed right on in<br> and interrupted you.<br> Who are you, then?<br> Bob Ford.<br> Charley's brother?<br> Yeah.<br> I was lying when I said<br> I just happened down here.<br> I've been looking for you. I feel lousy<br> I didn't say so at the outset.<br> Folks take me for a nincompoop...<br> ...on account of the shabby first impression<br> I make, whereas I think of myself...<br> ...as being just a rung down<br> from the James brothers.<br> I was hoping if I ran into you<br> aside from those peckerwoods...<br> ...I could show you how special I am.<br> I honestly believe I'm destined<br> for great things, Mr. James.<br> I got qualities that don't come shining<br> through right at the outset.<br> You give me a chance, I'll get<br> the job done. I guarantee you that.<br> Hey, Dick, is it true you diddled a squaw?<br> Come on, you can tell me. I've always<br> wanted to lay down with a redskin.<br> Well, Charley...<br> ...there's a feeling that comes over you...<br> ...getting inside a woman whose hands<br> has scalped a congregation.<br> There's this thunderous sound<br> that comes from their cooch...<br> ...on account of the fact that<br> they birth a child standing upright...<br> ...like a wild animal.<br> - What's it sound like?<br> Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds like<br> there, Charley. I don't know.<br> No.<br> They got a noisy quim<br> on account of the fact that...<br> ...they use their cunnis as a saddlebag<br> to carry sundries across the plains.<br> Come on, what'd it really feel like?<br> Did it feel good?<br> Come on, fess up, now.<br> I like you, Charley.<br> I like you too, Charley.<br> Well...<br> You're not so special, Mr. Ford.<br> You're just like any other tyro<br> who's prinked himself up for an escapade.<br> Hoping to be a gunslinger<br> like them nickel books are about.<br> You may as well quench your mind of it...<br> ...because you don't have<br> the ingredients, son.<br> Well, I'm sorry to hear<br> you feel that way...<br> ...as I put such stock<br> in your opinions.<br> As for me being a gunslinger, I've just got<br> this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...<br> ...and a borrowed belt to stick it in.<br> But I also got an appetite<br> for greater things.<br> I hoped by joining up with you, it'd put me<br> that much closer to getting them.<br> Well, what am I supposed to say to that?<br> Let me be your sidekick tonight.<br> Sidekick?<br> So you can examine my grit<br> and intelligence.<br> I don't know what it is about you...<br> ...but the more you talk,<br> the more you give me the willies.<br> Now, I don't believe I want you anywhere<br> within earshot this evening, okay?<br> You understand?<br> - Well, I'm sorry...<br> - Why don't you just get now? Scat.<br> All right.<br> I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.<br> But she was pretty.<br> She had yellow hair like a...<br> Oh, like something.<br> Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?<br> Yeah. Yeah, like that.<br> Boy, you... You talk good.<br> You can hide things in vocabulary.<br> Maybe you and me could write her a note,<br> send it by post?<br> See, all you gotta do, Ed...<br> ...is predict her needs<br> and beat her to the punch.<br> Well, this girl, she has a real specific job.<br> - Specific?<br> - We was only together once.<br> She...<br> She was afraid of lightning,<br> and she came up under the wagon and...<br> ...just cuddled right up to me.<br> She give me a kind price too.<br> Well, I'll be. That is specific.<br> Yeah, sure,<br> she'd been with other people...<br> ...but the kind of things she said to me...<br> ...people just don't say<br> unless they really mean it.<br> My love said she would marry only me<br> And Jove himself could not make her care.<br> For what women say to lovers, you'll agree<br> One writes on running water or on air.<br> My God, that's good.<br> Let's write her that.<br> No.<br> Poetry don't work on whores.<br> How do you do?<br> Am I too late<br> to wish you a happy birthday?<br> How'd you know?<br> You'd be surprised<br> at what I got stored away.<br> I'm an authority on the James boys.<br> Is you?<br> Well... Well, your brother Frank and I,<br> we just had a real nice visit.<br> Just chit-chatting about this and that,<br> right over there.<br> And must've been a hundred subjects<br> entertained...<br> Good Lord, you know<br> what this stew needs?<br> Dumplings?<br> Noodles.<br> You eat yourself some noodle stew<br> and your clock'll tick all night.<br> You ever see that woman up in Fayette?<br> Suck noodles up her nose.<br> - In Fayette?<br> - I don't believe I have.<br> You never heard of her, huh?<br> You got canals up there<br> you never dreamed of.<br> I don't like to harp on a subject...<br> I don't care who comes with me.<br> Never have.<br> That's why they call me gregarious.<br> I hear you and young Stovepipe here<br> had a real nice visit.<br> Your boys have got about a acre<br> of lumber to haul, dingus.<br> You better goose them down yonder.<br> The James Gang committed over 25 bank,<br> train and stagecoach robberies...<br> ...from 1867 to 1881.<br> But except for Frank and Jesse James...<br> ...all the original members<br> were now either dead or in prison.<br> - mine eye<br> All my soul and all my every part<br> And for this sin, there is no remedy<br> It is so grounded inward in my heart.<br> So for their last robbery at Blue Cut...<br> ...the brothers recruited a gang<br> of petty thieves and country rubes...<br> ...culled from the local hillsides.<br> Right on schedule, Buck!<br> Snuff those lanterns!<br> Look at those fools. They're gonna trip<br> and shoot each other into females.<br> I bet you I could find them husbands<br> if they do.<br> Fan out!<br> Hold your fire!<br> - Watch him!<br> - Going down.<br> Hold your fire, you idiots!<br> Hold your fire!<br> Let me in.<br> Buck! Boys!<br> Buck, this way!<br> Do you think that lock will hold?<br> No, I don't.<br> Let's go, let's go.<br> Let's not get clever, nor courageous,<br> any of you.<br> Hey there, boys!<br> These are all for me?<br> Looks like Christmas morning in here.<br> Hey, friend.<br> You mind if I have a peek around?<br> This shit. Nope.<br> Nope.<br> You got anything good here?<br> It could be.<br> Open that safe.<br> Do it!<br> - You didn't have to bop him.<br> - Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.<br> They got their company rules,<br> I got my mean streak...<br> ...and that's how<br> we get things done around here.<br> - Get on over here and attend to this thing.<br> - Come on, go.<br> Hold your fire, you idiots!<br> Dig deeper.<br> - Come on!<br> - Give me your money.<br> - And you, stand up.<br> - Let's see your hands.<br> What have you got?<br> Speak English.<br> Money. Money. You understand that?<br> Give me your money!<br> There's some receipts.<br> I got fives.<br> Jesse. Jesse.<br> Don't look good.<br> There ain't no 100,000 dollars<br> in here, Dick.<br> Get down on your knees.<br> Why?<br> Well, you ought to pray.<br> I'm gonna kill you.<br> Get at!<br> You're gonna have to make me.<br> All right.<br> Don't shoot him! No, don't shoot him.<br> Don't tell me what I can<br> and cannot do, Ed.<br> Round them up!<br> Chicago newspaper publishers made<br> a great deal of the Blue Cut train robbery...<br> ...alleging that in no state<br> but Missouri...<br> ...would the James brothers be tolerated<br> for 12 years.<br> Hey.<br> Can you keep a secret?<br> It depends on what you're concealing.<br> You afraid of the dark?<br> No.<br> You superstitious?<br> I put... I put an acorn in the window<br> to keep the lightning out.<br> Kid, you must've crept up on cat's paws.<br> I'll wager that's the first and last time<br> you'll ever be caught off-guard.<br> How old are you?<br> Twenty.<br> Except, well, I guess I won't<br> really be 20 till...<br> Till January, so...<br> I'm 19.<br> Yeah, you feel older than that, though,<br> don't you?<br> Yeah, I do.<br> Hey, Frank, you...<br> You think the sheriff's out already?<br> - More than likely.<br> - Yeah.<br> I had a real fine time tonight.<br> - You think so?<br> - Yup. Yeah.<br> Hey, I wasn't just flapping my lips<br> about my kid brother and me.<br> What I figured was if you and Jesse could<br> gauge our courage and our daring...<br> ...you might just make us<br> your regular sidekicks.<br> Your courage and your daring.<br> I about heard all I want to about sidekicks.<br> You sound like your damn brother.<br> Yeah. Well, I'll be square with you,<br> it's Bob who put me up to it. He's...<br> He's got plans for the James boys<br> I can't even get the hang of.<br> - They're that complicated.<br> - Yeah?<br> Well, you can just<br> get shed of that idea.<br> Because after tonight,<br> there'll be no more shenanigans.<br> You can jot that down in your little diary.<br> September 7th, 1881, the James Gang<br> robbed one last train at Blue Cut...<br> ...and gave up their nightriding for good.<br> Wait.<br> Well, how are you gonna<br> make your living?<br> Maybe I'll sell shoes.<br> I can't believe I woke up this morning...<br> ...wondering if my daddy<br> would loan me his overcoat...<br> ...and here it is just past midnight...<br> ...I've already robbed a railroad train<br> and I'm sitting in a rocking chair...<br> ...chatting with none other<br> than Jesse James.<br> Yeah, it's a wonderful world.<br> What's this?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I was real agitated this morning, so I was<br> wondering if I would know you or Frank...<br> ...tell you all apart, and so I had<br> this clipping that described you both.<br> Want me to read it?<br> Go on.<br> Well... I gotta find it. Hold on.<br> Here. Here.<br> "Jesse James, the youngest, has a face<br> as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.<br> The blue eyes, very clear and penetrating,<br> are never at rest.<br> His form is tall and graceful<br> and capable of great endurance...<br> ...and great effort.<br> Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,<br> and devil-may-care.<br> - There's always a smile on his lips..."<br> - All right, all right, all right.<br> Well, yeah, then it just... Frank, Frank,<br> Frank. That's nothing. And then...<br> You know what I got<br> right next to my bed?<br> Is The Train Robbers, or, A Story<br> of the James Boys by R.W. Stevens.<br> I mean, many's the night I stayed up...<br> ...with my eyes open<br> and my mouth open...<br> ...just reading about your escapades<br> in the Wide Awake Library.<br> They're all lies, you know.<br> Yeah, of course they are.<br> You don't have to keep smoking that<br> if it's making you bungey.<br> Alexander Franklin James<br> would be in Baltimore...<br> ...when he would read of<br> the assassination of Jesse James.<br> He had spurned his younger brother<br> for being peculiar and temperamental.<br> But once he perceived<br> that he would never see Jesse again...<br> ...Frank would be wrought-up,<br> perplexed, despondent.<br> My brother and me are hardly<br> on speaking terms these days.<br> Well, I wasn't gonna mention it.<br> Are you scared?<br> No, I'm just surprised a little.<br> They ain't as succulent as I like,<br> the devil to clean...<br> ...but if a man skins them<br> and fries them in garlic and oil...<br> ...mercy, them's good eating.<br> Well, I never been that hungry.<br> I give them names.<br> Such as?<br> Such as enemies.<br> I give them names of enemies.<br> Go tell Wood and Charley<br> to get their gatherings together.<br> All right.<br> Me too?<br> You can stay.<br> All right.<br> Hey.<br> - What do you want, peckerwood?<br> - Nothing.<br> Except to say Jesse wants<br> you two to gather your parts...<br> ...get on your horses<br> and get out of town.<br> And me to stick around.<br> Well, whoa, I'm his cousin...<br> ...I'll have you know.<br> My mama's his daddy's sister.<br> Is that how they described it to you,<br> Wood?<br> You better watch your tongue,<br> young sapling.<br> Why is it me who's gotta rattle his hocks<br> out of town and not you, Bunny?<br> Put your horns away.<br> If I know Jess...<br> ...there's some real nasty<br> sad-suzie work's gotta be done...<br> ...and Bob's the ninny that has to do it.<br> Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it, Charley.<br> You only met him 12 hours ago.<br> He doesn't even know your name.<br> Wood! You tell your daddy<br> I'll be in Kentucky in October.<br> We can hunt some birds together.<br> All right.<br> So how come it's Bob who gets to stay?<br> Bob's gonna move my gear to a house<br> down the street.<br> See?<br> - I don't mind.<br> - Yeah, well.<br> Sounds like an adventure.<br> They moved to 1017 Troost Avenue<br> at night...<br> ...so that the neighborhood couldn't get<br> a good look at them or their belongings.<br> Then Bob thought Jesse<br> would give him eight hours' sleep...<br> ...and a daydreaming goodbye.<br> But with a second day<br> in the Thomas Howard house...<br> ...Bob thought he might never go...<br> ...but might be brought in<br> as a good-natured cousin to the boy...<br> ...and a gentleman helper to Zee.<br> He went everywhere with Jesse.<br> They made trips<br> to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...<br> ...where Jesse could spend nearly<br> ...and still complain about feeling tipsy.<br> Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions<br> as they talked.<br> If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.<br> If Jesse palavered with another person,<br> Bob secretaried their dialogue...<br> ...getting each inflection,<br> reading every gesture and tic...<br> ...as if he wanted to compose<br> a biography of the outlaw...<br> ...or as if he were preparing<br> an impersonation.<br> Go away.<br> Used to be couldn't no one sneak up<br> on Jesse James.<br> Now you think otherwise?<br> I ain't never seen you without your guns,<br> neither.<br> I can't figure it out.<br> Do you wanna be like me...<br> ...or do you wanna be me?<br> I'm just making fun, is all.<br> Bob was sent away cordially<br> the next day...<br> ...with a goodbye from Jesse...<br> ...but nothing from Zee<br> beyond what good manners demanded.<br> It was 40 miles to his sister's farm<br> from Kansas City.<br> And it was well into the afternoon<br> by the time he arrived there.<br> Mrs. Martha Bolton rented<br> the Harbison farm in 1879...<br> ...just after becoming a widow.<br> And she made a good income<br> by giving rooms and meals...<br> ...to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,<br> and to members of the James Gang...<br> ...who would appear<br> whenever they needed seclusion.<br> Dick! You're gonna make her sick!<br> She's gonna upchuck<br> if you don't watch out!<br> Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha<br> in his affections...<br> ...and his attempt to switch his pursuit<br> to her daughter...<br> ...was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.<br> Wait a second, you assured me<br> that you were not ticklish.<br> Howdy!<br> What's going on, now?<br> What's going on...?<br> - Howdy!<br> - Were you fibbing about that?<br> - No.<br> - Not at all.<br> You're not supposed to peek, Dick.<br> Well, you're just so pretty<br> I can't help myself.<br> - You need to be warning him about that.<br> - Howdy.<br> Worry about the field instead,<br> might be able to worry about the work...<br> Howdy!<br> - Finally home.<br> - I'm so glad, Bob.<br> I'm in that room too, Bob.<br> Don't mess with my things.<br> All right, Grandpa.<br> "July 9th. Diligence, tact,<br> and a keen sense of responsibility...<br> ...capacity for detail are your dominant<br> traits. Your sense of duty's strong."<br> How long you been there?<br> Just now arrived. Did I miss much?<br> Not unless you never seen a man<br> wash his dirty carcass before.<br> Boy, you got a big old pecker<br> for being such a little squirrel.<br> That what you come here to see, Dick?<br> No.<br> Your brother said that Jesse<br> kept you in Kansas City some extra days.<br> What was the reason?<br> Well, I'm not at liberty to say exactly.<br> Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention<br> that me and Cummins were in cahoots?<br> Is that so?<br> Oh, dear. I went on and said too much,<br> have I?<br> Well, who else is partners with you two?<br> See, he'll cut our throats if he finds out.<br> You don't know him like I do.<br> You do Jesse dirt,<br> you connive behind his back...<br> ...boy, he'll come after you<br> with a cleaver.<br> So, what are you two cahoots<br> cooking up?<br> Don't know that I should say.<br> I'm not gonna wheedle<br> the dang news from you.<br> How about we'll leave it a mystery...<br> ...and then we won't neither one of us<br> regret our little chat?<br> Can you hand me that six-gun there, Bob?<br> If you so much as mention my name<br> to Jesse...<br> ...boy, I'll find out about it.<br> You had better believe that.<br> And I'll look you up.<br> I'll knock on your door,<br> and I will be as mad as a hornet.<br> I will be hot.<br> You be careful with that iron, Dick.<br> You know where I stand on these matters<br> and that's all there is to it.<br> Me and you can be as friendly as pigs<br> from now on.<br> I'm Bunny Ford, stick your hands<br> up in the air!<br> Mister.<br> Oh, you have some nerve.<br> We were just reading about the James boys<br> among the Mexicans.<br> What's this? This ain't Jesse.<br> - You don't know that.<br> - He would've never wore no mustache.<br> Never was anywheres near a cannon.<br> Let me see that picture.<br> Boy, I can't even calculate<br> what I'm looking at.<br> - Give me that.<br> - Ever since he was a child...<br> ...Bob's collected whatsoever he could find<br> about the James brothers.<br> Yeah, got himself a little museum<br> in his room.<br> Next time you come snooping around,<br> you better strap on a shooting iron!<br> Well, you can see how scared I am.<br> You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,<br> I'll put a bullet through your head!<br> Boy, you...<br> Son, you better recollect<br> who my cousin is...<br> ...because you've seemed to misremembered<br> that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.<br> Now, you may play it like you're<br> a dangerous person in the grocery store...<br> ...but don't misremember<br> who you be accounting to...<br> ...if I so much get my feelings hurt.<br> - I don't care!<br> Do I have to yell "suwee"?<br> Why don't we make up,<br> be pleasant for once?<br> Why don't we pass the evening<br> like pleasant human beings?<br> I like your nickel suit, cowboy.<br> You see something?<br> Just a bird.<br> The month of October came...<br> ...and Jesse began seeing<br> Pinkerton operatives in every floor walker...<br> ...street sweeper, and common man<br> poking about in a store.<br> On the morning of the 11 th,<br> he would wake his wife...<br> ...with the Scripture pertaining to<br> the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.<br> Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan<br> vanished from Kansas City.<br> Shortly thereafter,<br> four of the Blue Cut train robbers...<br> ...were arrested in shacks near Glendale.<br> How Jesse could have known<br> remains a mystery.<br> Theirs was a wandering existence.<br> Men who choose to be outlaws...<br> ...cannot afford to remain in one place<br> for very long.<br> - Well, goodness. Maybe I'll change my mind.<br> - Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.<br> - Martha.<br> - Buck up, man.<br> Wood and Dick would bicker<br> across the entire state of Kentucky...<br> ...until they made Russellville, home<br> of Major George Hite, Wood's father...<br> ...and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.<br> You stay away from this one.<br> She's my daddy's wife.<br> You got it?<br> Did you cook this, ma'am?<br> I've got a nigger woman.<br> How's that?<br> Dick asked if I cooked this.<br> Did you?<br> No.<br> She knew what he was like<br> when she married him.<br> I guess we're the night owls, you and I.<br> I'm glad.<br> How come?<br> You're interesting to look at.<br> You have a real pleasant disposition.<br> And I don't know, you sort of<br> make me feel warm all over.<br> You know, I'm what they call a...<br> An inamorato.<br> Well, I knew<br> there had to be a name for it.<br> You and the Hites<br> don't get along too well...<br> ...if I'm to trust Wood and his version<br> of the situation.<br> We hate each other like poison,<br> if you wanna know the truth.<br> Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me<br> if I was on fire.<br> They say that when a woman's on fire...<br> ...you're supposed to roll her around on<br> the ground and cover her with your body.<br> Well, you are a naughty tease.<br> Isn't it about bedtime?<br> Well, I'll just kiss those dainty nubbins.<br> Good night.<br> Would you stop?<br> Boy, I believe I drank too much coffee.<br> I gotta go visit the privy<br> something terrible.<br> This is embarrassing.<br> Now, you go ahead and do your duty.<br> I don't mind.<br> I've sort of got stage fright with<br> a strange man in the commode with me.<br> I ain't strange.<br> I'm built just like the rest of them.<br> You look awful pretty.<br> Do I?<br> I haven't never in my life seen<br> such well-shaped limbs.<br> Is Wood awake?<br> It's just me.<br> And I bet you thought I was a lady.<br> Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,<br> are you?<br> You didn't just happen by.<br> Why not?<br> Go on and take a load off your feet.<br> You ought to get yourself a wife.<br> Yeah.<br> I suppose.<br> I was gonna ask Martha. Charley's sister.<br> I was gonna ask her<br> if she could imagine it.<br> But I guess Wood has plans of his own.<br> And there's always Dick Liddil<br> getting in the way.<br> I'll give it some thought, though.<br> Your crops come in?<br> No, I don't got much.<br> Just a garden patch and a pasture.<br> I was sick at planting time.<br> So...<br> Ed, how you feeling now?<br> Why?<br> You're acting queer.<br> Well, you and me ain't been<br> just real good friends lately.<br> That's not your fault,<br> you understand that.<br> You hear talk, though.<br> Talk?<br> People tell you things.<br> Why don't you give me an example?<br> Jim Cummins come by here.<br> Jim Cummins.<br> Oh, and Jim says:<br> "You know them boys<br> that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?"<br> Well, Jim says he got word...<br> ...that you're planning to kill them.<br> Why would I do that?<br> That's just talk probably.<br> Jim Cummins. He say anything else?<br> Nope. No, that was it, basically.<br> That still don't explain why you're scared.<br> Well, I'm in the same situation, you see.<br> I was terrified I saw you ride up.<br> - I just happened by, Ed.<br> - Suppose you heard gossip, though.<br> Suppose you heard Jim Cummins<br> come by, you might have thought...<br> ...that we were planning to capture you<br> or get that reward, and that ain't true.<br> But you might have suspected it.<br> Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.<br> I got 600 dollars stashed away.<br> I don't need no governor's reward.<br> Well, it's the principle too.<br> Well...<br> - I'm glad I stopped by.<br> - Oh, me too.<br> What do you say<br> if we were to go for a ride?<br> We can go into town. I'll buy you dinner.<br> Then I'll be on my way.<br> Okay.<br> You ready to go for a ride?<br> We going to your place?<br> You seen Ed Miller lately?<br> Nobody has.<br> Must have gone off to California.<br> I'd still like to know where we're going.<br> If you were going to see Jim Cummins,<br> wouldn't you follow this road?<br> I guess so.<br> Howdy.<br> Oh, are you friends of my pa's?<br> We're friends of Jim Cummins.<br> Well, it so happens<br> he's been gone since August.<br> And never said where he gone to.<br> - I'm Matt Collins.<br> - Albert Ford.<br> Very happy to meet you.<br> - Dick Turpin.<br> - Pleased to make your acquaintance.<br> I don't know where he is!<br> Leave me alone!<br> Shut your mouth!<br> You shut your mouth!<br> - You shut your mouth.<br> - I don't know where he is!<br> - I don't know!<br> - Get in there.<br> Shut up.<br> - I don't know where he is!<br> - Shut up.<br> - I don't know!<br> - Shut up.<br> - Jesus.<br> - Shut up.<br> Jesse, he's just a kid.<br> He knows where his uncle Jim is and<br> that's gonna make him old soon enough.<br> - Maybe he doesn't know.<br> - He knows!<br> You need to ask and ask sometimes.<br> Sometimes a child don't remember so much<br> at first. But it'll come back to him.<br> My goodness, she's about to rip off,<br> sweetie.<br> Just a little more here to get her started.<br> Then I think I can rip her off<br> like a page from a book.<br> Jesus, he can't even talk.<br> Where's Jim?<br> Where's Jim?<br> Where's Jim? Where's Jim?<br> Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?<br> - Where's Jim?<br> - Quit it!<br> You bastard! I don't know where he is!<br> You won't believe me!<br> You never even gave me a chance!<br> You kept my... You kept my mouth shut!<br> I never know where Jim is or<br> when he comes! So leave me alone.<br> Get off me, you son of a bitch!<br> I'm worn out.<br> I can't. No, see...<br> My mind's all tangled anyway.<br> Little deals like this<br> just make me feel dirty.<br> Are you all right, Jesse?<br> Jesse was sick...<br> ...with rheums, and aches<br> and lung congestions.<br> Insomnia stained<br> his eye sockets like soot.<br> He read auguries in<br> the snarled intestines of chickens...<br> ...or the blow of cat hair<br> released to the wind.<br> And the omens promised bad luck,<br> which moated and dungeoned him.<br> How come it's you<br> that's gotta do all the chores?<br> Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha<br> so that they don't have to.<br> It still don't seem fair.<br> Martha.<br> Well, look what the cat dragged in.<br> You come from Kentucky?<br> Why do you have your head in a hole,<br> Martha?<br> Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape<br> a few months ago.<br> Cover the kettle, Ida.<br> And what did you and Dick<br> get in a scrape about?<br> Well, he tampered<br> with my daddy's wife...<br> ...while a pork chop<br> burned on the skillet...<br> ...so I shot at him.<br> Ida! Do not stick your thumb<br> in the cream when you skim it.<br> His chicanery and his philandering ways...<br> ...has instigated such malice.<br> He's a yellow snake in the grass<br> and he can't be trusted, Martha.<br> Dick told me a complete other version<br> of that affray.<br> Wood Hite's downstairs.<br> You mean he's here?<br> Yeah, he come in late last night.<br> Hey, simmer down!<br> Don't get into a fracas up there, you boys!<br> I've got breakfast almost ready.<br> He's still sucking air.<br> But I think he's a goner.<br> Maybe y'all better come wish him well<br> on his journey.<br> Wood?<br> You were a good fellow, Wood.<br> Oh, I sure hope you're not<br> in frightful pain, Wood.<br> I'd get you something to drink,<br> but I'm afraid you'd just choke on it.<br> Little Ida's gonna miss you.<br> So is the rest of the family.<br> Well, one thing's settled.<br> Can't take him into Richmond.<br> Why not?<br> Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.<br> And two, Jesse'll find out his cousin<br> Wood's been shot in our house...<br> ...and then that'll be the end<br> of each and every one of us.<br> "And in one merciless, violent thrust<br> broke in...<br> ...and carried all before him,<br> and scented and brewed...<br> ...reeking with blood of my virginity...<br> ...up to its utmost length in my body."<br> He ain't disappeared,<br> if that's what you were hoping.<br> What chapter you on?<br> She's met some Algerian corsair<br> down at Gibraltar.<br> Got herself all agitated.<br> How's that leg?<br> Full of torment, Bob. Thanks for asking.<br> Blessed are the poor in spirit...<br> ...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br> Blessed are them that mourn,<br> for they shall be comforted.<br> Blessed are the...<br> Meek.<br> Blessed are the meek.<br> - Is it him?<br> - Yeah.<br> Why is he here? Does he know<br> about Wood, do you think?<br> I don't know. All I know is<br> he don't miss very much.<br> - What should I say about you if he asks?<br> - Tell him I'm in K.C. with Mattie.<br> He was buffalo hunting.<br> He was thrilled to meet yours truly.<br> Yeah, over there in Europe there's only<br> two Americans they know for certain...<br> ...Mark Twain and Jesse James.<br> - Why, it's the kid.<br> - How's everything?<br> - I never take off my gun belts.<br> - Yeah?<br> Good thinking.<br> Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?<br> Yeah, I slipped...<br> I slipped off the roof...<br> ...and I smacked down into a snow bank<br> like a ton of stupidness.<br> One second I'm screaming,<br> "Whoa, Nelly!"<br> Next second, poof,<br> I'm neck-deep in snow.<br> Well, whatever possessed you<br> to climb a roof in December?<br> There was a k... A kite. What am I saying?<br> There was a cat.<br> A cat. It was on the roof<br> and I went after him.<br> It was a tomcat yowling<br> and what all, and I slipped.<br> I thought maybe your club foot<br> was gaining on you.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Dick went to Kansas City to be<br> with his wife. He was here for a bit.<br> Hey, here's a cute story, Jess.<br> Bobby was what, 11 or 12...<br> ...and you were by far<br> his most admired personage.<br> He couldn't get enough.<br> It was "Jesse this" and "Jesse that"<br> and "Jesse this" from sunrise to sunset.<br> Fascinating.<br> No, there's more. This is cute.<br> We're at supper and Bob asks,<br> "You know what size boot Jesse wears?"<br> - Charley, Jesse doesn't wanna hear this.<br> - Shush, now, Bob, let me tell it.<br> Bob says... He says, "You know<br> what size boot Jesse wears?"<br> He says, "Six and a half." He says,<br> "Ain't that a big enough boot...<br> ...for a man 5'8"tall?"<br> I decided to josh him a little, you know,<br> he being my kid brother and everything.<br> So I said, "He doesn't have toes is why."<br> That's a really stupid story.<br> "He was dangling his feet off a culvert<br> and a catfish nibbled his toes off."<br> Bob taxed himself trying to picture it.<br> That'd be a good joke if it was funny.<br> Isn't that a cute story, Jess?<br> Give me some more conversations, Bob.<br> I got one. This one's about as crackerjack...<br> It's the one about your...<br> Let Bob tell it.<br> All right.<br> I don't even know<br> what you're talking about.<br> About how you and Jesse<br> have so much in common.<br> Go on, Bob.<br> Yeah, come on, Bob.<br> Tell us a story.<br> - Nope. No.<br> - Come on, entertain Jesse. He's here.<br> Come on.<br> Well, if you'll pardon my saying so,<br> I guess...<br> ...it is interesting the many ways<br> you and I overlap and whatnot.<br> I mean, you begin with our daddies.<br> Your daddy was a pastor<br> at the New Hope Baptist Church...<br> ...and my daddy was a pastor<br> at the church in Excelsior Springs.<br> You're the youngest of three James boys,<br> and I'm the youngest of five Ford boys.<br> Between Charley and me,<br> there's another brother, Wilbur...<br> ...with six letters in his name.<br> And between Frank and you, is another<br> brother Robert, also with six letters.<br> And my Christian name<br> is Robert, of course.<br> You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes.<br> You're 5'8"tall, I'm 5'8" tall.<br> Me, I must have had a list as long as<br> your nightshirt when I was 12, but...<br> ...I seem to have lost some curiosities<br> over the years.<br> Ain't he something?<br> Did I ever tell you the story about<br> that scalawag, George Shepherd?<br> Shepherd's one of<br> Quantrill's lieutenants.<br> He give me a story much like Bob's<br> what bring him to mind.<br> Going on about how much<br> we had in common, and so on...<br> ...so he could get in the gang.<br> How could I have known<br> he had a grudge against me?<br> How could I have known<br> he was lying to get on my good side?<br> I said, "George, come on aboard.<br> Glad to have you."<br> George thought he was smart,<br> except he wasn't.<br> One morning, George rides into camp...<br> ...and about 20 guns open up on him.<br> See, old George, he only had one eye. You<br> gotta have two eyes, you wanna get Jesse.<br> You ought not think of me<br> like you do George Shepherd.<br> You brought him to mind.<br> Well, it's not very flattering.<br> Sure is good eating, Martha.<br> Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it.<br> How come George<br> had a grudge against you?<br> I said, how come George<br> had a grudge against you?<br> Well, you see, George had a nephew<br> he wanted me to protect during the war.<br> This nephew had 5000 dollars on him.<br> It just so happens he winds up killed<br> and someone swipes that money.<br> And when George is in prison,<br> someone whispers to him:<br> "It was Jesse James<br> slit the boy's throat."<br> It was just mean gossip, was it?<br> Bob's the expert. Let's put it to him.<br> Oh, dear, I made him cranky.<br> I'm not cranky. I just been<br> through this before is all.<br> Most people get around on making fun<br> of me. They don't ever let up.<br> Someone's getting awful fresh over there.<br> Woman, shut your face for once.<br> Don't want you to skip off<br> to your room and pout...<br> ...without knowing why I come by<br> for this visit.<br> Why? So you could<br> tell us how sorry you are...<br> ...you had to slap our cousin Albert around?<br> I come by...<br> ...to ask if one of you two Fords...<br> ...would care to ride with me<br> in a journey or two.<br> I guess we both agree<br> it ought to be Charley.<br> You've been acting sort of testy.<br> Have you seen Wood Hite lately?<br> No. Not at all.<br> I swear that stew<br> had some squirrel meat in it.<br> - Still arguing with you, is it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You're Charles Ford?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> You've seen me once or twice before.<br> I got a letter from George Hite.<br> He hasn't seen hide nor hair of him.<br> And you say you haven't seen Wood?<br> No, I... I can't imagine where he could be.<br> Yeah?<br> You finished with your sleeping?<br> I could use a couple more hours<br> if it's no trouble.<br> Yeah.<br> I been holding a discussion with myself<br> over if I ought to tell you this or no.<br> My good side won out and...<br> Well, I wanna make a clean breast<br> of things.<br> Yeah, my mind's a little cobwebby<br> is the only drawback.<br> I could use a little...<br> A little more sleep.<br> You know I went to Kentucky?<br> Yeah.<br> I come back through Saline County and...<br> ...I think to myself:<br> "Why not stop by and see Ed Miller?"<br> So I do.<br> Well, things are not to my satisfaction.<br> Ed's got himself all worked up<br> over something.<br> I can see that he's lying like a rug.<br> So I say to myself, "Enough's enough."<br> And I say to Ed, "Come on, Ed.<br> Let's go for a ride."<br> You understand what I'm saying?<br> Going for a ride is like...<br> Going for a ride<br> is like giving him what-for?<br> Exactly.<br> So...<br> ...Ed and Jesse...<br> ...they argue on the road.<br> Did you ever count the stars?<br> I can't ever get the same number.<br> They keep changing on me.<br> I don't even know what a star is exactly.<br> Well, your body knows.<br> It's your mind that forgot.<br> You go on ahead, partner.<br> I'll catch up with you.<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.<br> And when push came to shove...<br> ...Jesse shot and killed him.<br> Jesse did.<br> You got it.<br> You...<br> So, you see, your...<br> Your cousin, he got off easy.<br> I was just playing with Albert.<br> Yeah, I made him squeal<br> once or twice myself.<br> I'm just not as thorough as you are.<br> You got a tale to swap with me now?<br> I don't get your meaning.<br> Seems to me, if you have something<br> to confess in exchange...<br> ...it'd only be right...<br> ...that you'd spit it out now.<br> I can't think of a single thing.<br> About Wood Hite, for example.<br> I'm not gonna... I been saying over and<br> over I can't figure out where he's gone.<br> Now, I'm not gonna change my story<br> just to have something to spit.<br> - Why was your brother so agitated?<br> - Which?<br> Bob.<br> That's just his way. He's antsy.<br> You know?<br> You go on back to sleep now.<br> You got me agitated now, you see?<br> Yeah, just ain't no peace<br> when old Jesse's around.<br> You ought to pity my poor wife.<br> Ed Miller was a good friend of mine.<br> He introduced me to you<br> at that one poker game.<br> I'm a little angry with you, if you<br> wanna know the God's honest truth.<br> You ought to pity me too.<br> As proof of his confederacy with<br> the James Gang, Bob told the authorities...<br> ...that Dick Liddil was sleeping over<br> at the rented farmhouse...<br> ...while his ruined leg mended.<br> And then, created a map<br> of the Harbison property...<br> ...leaving out the creek where<br> Wood Hite's remains now moldered.<br> Right, you boys are cornered!<br> Come on out peaceably<br> and nobody'll get shot up!<br> Don't shoot!<br> Come on out and show yourself!<br> Hello.<br> We got him.<br> Give me that Colt, son.<br> - All right.<br> - Andrew James Liddil...<br> ...I have a warrant here<br> for your arrest...<br> Snowstorms would move over Missouri<br> that Sunday, February 19th...<br> ...shutting down commerce<br> for more than two days.<br> - Go, go, go.<br> - Are the papers here?<br> - He wanted to know if the papers are here.<br> - I don't care what he wants.<br> Yet this wouldn't prevent Robert Ford...<br> ...from presenting himself<br> to Governor Crittenden...<br> ...at the Craig Rifles Ball on Wednesday.<br> I deem it a great privilege<br> on this glorious occasion...<br> ...to recognize publicly...<br> ...the intelligent and effective assistance...<br> ...that Captain Henry Craig has rendered<br> the state of Missouri and myself...<br> ...in our joint quest<br> to rid Jackson County...<br> ...of the James band.<br> The task that Captain Craig<br> has assumed...<br> ...will require fearless courage,<br> extraordinary vigilance...<br> ...and an unerring selection<br> of instrumentalities.<br> Well, I've gotten the signal from my wife<br> that enough is enough.<br> However, before I sit...<br> ...I would like to ask you<br> to join me in a toast...<br> ...to a great son<br> of the state of Missouri...<br> ...my friend, Henry Craig.<br> - Here, here.<br> Yes.<br> Just let my attorney know.<br> Who is that? Who is it?<br> Get out of the way now.<br> You know, you're more goddamn trouble<br> than you're worth, Bob.<br> I was just gonna say hello.<br> No, you weren't gonna do that, Bob.<br> That's not why you're down here.<br> You think it's your goddamn coming-out.<br> You think you're the belle of the ball.<br> Now you get upstairs and try to keep your<br> identity secret, you silly little bastard.<br> The governor'll see you in good time.<br> Take him up, boys.<br> Bob would later be cross-examined<br> repeatedly...<br> ...about the exact nature of the deal<br> he had made with the authorities.<br> And he was never consistent<br> in his recollections.<br> My wife's asleep in the other room,<br> so let's speak as quietly as we can.<br> So you're Dick Little.<br> Liddil.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> I spell it with two D's.<br> He's given us a full confession, governor.<br> Newspapers haven't caught onto it yet.<br> And you've guaranteed him<br> a conditional pardon...<br> ...and amnesty for all the robberies<br> he's committed.<br> You Robert Ford?<br> How old are you?<br> Twenty.<br> You surrender to Sheriff Timberlake<br> as well?<br> No, no, governor. That's his brother,<br> Charley Ford, he's in the James Gang.<br> But little Bob here,<br> we got nothing on Bob.<br> He's just acting in capacity as a...<br> ...private detective.<br> Jesse James sent me a telegram<br> last month...<br> ...saying he'd kill me<br> if he had to wreck a train to do it.<br> He said once I got in his hands,<br> he'd cut my heart out...<br> ...and eat it in strips like it was bacon.<br> I'll wreck his train first.<br> I'm sorry, Your Excellency.<br> I was thinking about something else.<br> Jesse James is nothing more<br> than a public outlaw...<br> ...who made his reputation<br> by stealing whatever he wanted...<br> ...killing whoever got in his way.<br> You'll hear some fools say he's getting back<br> at Republicans and Union men...<br> ...for the wrongs his family suffered<br> during the war.<br> But his victims have scarcely been selected<br> with reference to their political views.<br> I'm saying his sins will soon find him out.<br> I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full.<br> I'm saying Jesse James<br> is a desperate case...<br> ...and may require a desperate remedy.<br> Y'all got the right man for the job.<br> Come on. Come on, now.<br> Come on, now.<br> Have you ever considered suicide?<br> I can't say that I have. There's always<br> something else I wanted to do.<br> Or my predicaments changed,<br> or I saw my hardships from a different slant.<br> You know all what can happen.<br> It never seemed respectable.<br> I'll tell you one thing that's for certain.<br> You won't mind dying<br> once you've peeked over the other side.<br> You'll no more wanna go back<br> to your body than...<br> ...you'd wanna spoon up your own puke.<br> Hey, since we're looking to rob banks...<br> ...I was wondering if we could<br> add another fella to the gang...<br> ...and sort of see if we couldn't<br> come out of our next job alive.<br> Bob wanted to know could he ride with us<br> next time we took on a savings bank or...<br> A savings bank or a...<br> A railroad.<br> Bob isn't much more than a boy<br> to most appearances.<br> But there's about two tons<br> of sand in him.<br> And he'll stand with a shooter<br> when that's what's called for.<br> And he's smart too.<br> He's about as intricate as they come.<br> You forget I already met the kid.<br> Hell, he surely thinks highly of you.<br> All of America thinks highly of me.<br> Still, not like you got two million names<br> to snatch out of a sock...<br> ...whenever you need a third man.<br> I can see you trying to<br> wear me down on this.<br> That's my main intention.<br> Robberies would be conceived<br> but never carried out...<br> ...in Nebraska, Colorado and Missouri.<br> During this time...<br> ...Henry Craig enjoined Robert Ford to return<br> to Elias' Grocery Store in Richmond...<br> ...and await instructions<br> from Sheriff James Timberlake.<br> All right, three cans...<br> ...peaches. Two cans...<br> Two cans sifted peas.<br> One bottle...<br> ...Mary's Morning Tonic, and a half...<br> Half a sack of flour.<br> I'll be right with you.<br> I haven't seen any sign of him.<br> Well, do you know where he's living?<br> No.<br> No?<br> Well, I can't guess how he does it...<br> ...but he is always knowledgeable<br> about what's going on.<br> He's gonna know I've been here with you.<br> You ought to take that for granted.<br> And he will kill you if he gets the chance.<br> Are you willing to risk that?<br> Yes, I am.<br> I've been a nobody all my life.<br> I was the baby.<br> I was the one they made promises to<br> that they never kept.<br> And ever since I can remember it,<br> Jesse James has been as big as a tree.<br> I'm prepared for this, Jim...<br> ...and I'm gonna accomplish it.<br> I know I won't get<br> but this one opportunity...<br> ...and you can bet your life<br> I'm not gonna spoil it.<br> Well...<br> ...wait for your chance.<br> Don't let yourself be found alone with him,<br> and do not...<br> ...let him get behind you.<br> You been chosen.<br> Well, what do you mean?<br> Well, your brother said that<br> you might wanna join us.<br> But maybe you like this grocery store<br> more than you said you did.<br> - So you missed me?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I been crying myself to sleep every night.<br> Don't let him see us so much as wink.<br> He's suspicious as a damn coyote,<br> and he don't trust you one iota.<br> - Well, I guess that makes...<br> - Hey.<br> He already put away Ed Miller. He said so<br> like it was something piddly he'd done.<br> If we're ever alone for more than a minute,<br> I'd like a chance to talk to you further.<br> They gave me ten days.<br> For what?<br> For arresting him.<br> You and me, huh?<br> It's gonna happen one way or another,<br> Charley. It's gonna happen.<br> So it might as well be us<br> who get rich on it.<br> - Bob, he's our friend.<br> - He murdered Ed Miller.<br> And he's gonna murder Liddil and Cummins<br> if the chance ever comes.<br> It seems to me Jesse's riding from<br> man to man, saying goodbye to the gang.<br> So your friendship could put you<br> under the pansies.<br> I'll grind it fine in my mind, Bob. I can't<br> go any further than that right now.<br> You'll come around.<br> You think it's all made up, don't you?<br> You think it's all yarns<br> and newspaper stories.<br> He's just a human being.<br> From now on, you two<br> won't go anywhere without me.<br> From now on, you'll ask for my permission!<br> From now on, you'll ask to be excused!<br> Charley, take them horses<br> around the barn. Bob, you go on inside.<br> - Hello, Mary.<br> - Hi.<br> Look at this rotten parsnip<br> I found in the compost heap.<br> You never mentioned Bob would be here.<br> Maybe he was saving it<br> as a pleasant surprise.<br> Got two cousins for company now.<br> How it's gonna be is...<br> ...we'll leave next Monday afternoon<br> and ride down to Platte City.<br> How far is that from Kansas City?<br> Platte City's 30 miles south.<br> You and me and Charley'll<br> sleep in the woods overnight...<br> ...and we'll strike the Wells Bank<br> sometime before the court recesses.<br> What time will that be exactly?<br> Well, you don't need to know that.<br> You know, I'm real comfortable<br> with your brother.<br> Hell, he's ugly as sin,<br> he smells like a skunk...<br> ...and he's so ignorant<br> he couldn't drive nails in the snow...<br> ...but he's sort of easy to be around.<br> I can't say the same for you, Bob.<br> Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that.<br> You know how it is when you're<br> with your girlfriend and the moon's out...<br> ...and you know she wants to be kissed,<br> even though she never said so?<br> Yeah.<br> Well, you're giving me signs<br> that grieve my soul...<br> ...and make me wonder...<br> ...maybe your mind's<br> been changed about me.<br> Well, what do you want me to do?<br> Swear my good faith on the Bible?<br> You two having a spat?<br> I was getting ready to be angry.<br> Sit over here closer, kid.<br> Come on.<br> Charley, you'll stay with the animals.<br> Me and the kid...<br> ...will walk into that bank<br> just before noon.<br> Bob will move that cashier...<br> ...away from the shotgun<br> that's under the counter...<br> ...and I'll creep up behind that cashier...<br> ...and I'll cock his head back like so.<br> And I'll say:<br> "How come an off-scouring<br> like you is still sucking air...<br> ...when so many of mine<br> are in coffins?" I'll say:<br> "How did you get to reach 20<br> without leaking out all over your clothes?"<br> And if I don't like his attitude,<br> I will slit that phildoodle so deep...<br> ...he will flop on the floor like a fish.<br> My God, what just happened?<br> Boy, I could hear your gears grinding...<br> ...hear your little motor wondering,<br> "My gosh, what's next?<br> What's happening to me?"<br> You were precious to behold, Bob.<br> You were white as spit in a cotton field.<br> You got him. You got him.<br> You wanna know how that feels?<br> Unpleasant. I honestly can't recommend it.<br> The old Charley looked stricken!<br> I was. I was.<br> "This is plumb unexpected," old Charley<br> was thinking."That done ruined my day."<br> Hell. Hell.<br> Jesse slept with Bob<br> in the children's room that night.<br> And Bob remained awake.<br> He could see that there was a gun<br> on the nightstand.<br> He could imagine its cold nickel<br> inside his grip...<br> ...its two-pound weight<br> reached out and aimed.<br> I need to go to the privy.<br> You think you do, but you don't.<br> You wait for grace, now.<br> - Thank you, Mama.<br> - Thank you, Zee. God, that looks good.<br> - Thank you, Zee.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Well, is this fit to eat or will it just do?<br> Woman's cooking's<br> always been a scandal.<br> Cut her meat and the whole table moves.<br> You want a biscuit?<br> You gonna have a biscuit?<br> Here's some butter.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Oh, shoot.<br> And so it went,<br> Jesse was increasingly cavalier...<br> ...merry, moody, fey...<br> ...unpredictable.<br> He camouflaged his depressions<br> and derangements...<br> ...with masquerades<br> of extreme cordiality, courtesy...<br> ...and goodwill towards others.<br> But even as he jested,<br> or tickled his boy in the ribs...<br> ...Jesse would look over at Bob<br> with melancholy eyes...<br> ...as if the two were meshed<br> in an intimate communication.<br> Bob was certain that the man<br> had unriddled him...<br> ...had seen through his reasons<br> for coming along...<br> ...that Jesse could forecast each of<br> Bob's possible moves and inclinations...<br> ...and was only acting the innocent...<br> ...in order to lull Bob<br> into stupid tranquility and miscalculation.<br> How long you been studying me?<br> You're gonna break a lot of hearts.<br> How do you mean?<br> It's a present.<br> It's heavy.<br> Well, you gonna look inside?<br> It's April Fools' Day, you know.<br> It ain't no joke.<br> Oh, such extravagance.<br> Don't that nickel just shine, though?<br> It's more than I could hope for.<br> I figured that granddaddy Colt<br> may blow into fragments...<br> ...next time you try<br> to squeeze the trigger.<br> Well, you might have something there.<br> Tom, supper's ready.<br> I'll be right there, sweetheart.<br> I might be too excited to eat.<br> You know what John Newman Edwards<br> once wrote about me?<br> He said I didn't trust<br> two men in 10,000...<br> ...and even them I was cautious around.<br> Government's sort of run me ragged.<br> I'm going the long way around the barn<br> to say that...<br> ...I been feeling cornered<br> and just plain ornery as of late...<br> ...and I'd be pleased if you'd accept<br> that gun as my way of apologizing.<br> Heaven knows I'd be ornerier<br> if I were in your position.<br> No. No, I haven't been acting correctly.<br> Seems I hardly recognize myself<br> when I'm greased.<br> I go on journeys out of my body...<br> ...and look at my red hands<br> and my mean face...<br> ...and I wonder about that man<br> that's gone so wrong.<br> I've been becoming a problem to myself.<br> Well...<br> - I better wash my hands if supper's on.<br> - Yeah, go ahead.<br> The day before he died was Palm Sunday.<br> And Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Howard,<br> their two children...<br> ...and their cousin Charles Johnson...<br> ...strolled to the Second Presbyterian<br> Church to attend the 10:00 service.<br> Bob remained at the cottage...<br> ...and slyly migrated from room to room.<br> He walked into the master bedroom...<br> ...and inventoried the clothes<br> on the hangers and hooks.<br> He sipped from the water glass<br> on the vanity.<br> He smelled the talcum and lilacs<br> on Jesse's pillowcase.<br> His fingers skittered over his ribs...<br> ...to construe the scars<br> where Jesse was twice shot.<br> He manufactured a middle finger<br> that was missing the top two knuckles.<br> He imagined himself at 34.<br> He imagined himself in a coffin.<br> He considered possibilities...<br> ...and everything wonderful<br> that could come true.<br> He's not gonna kill us.<br> Yeah, he is.<br> Well, I'll stay awake so he can't.<br> You're imagining things.<br> Ain't gonna be no Platte City.<br> That's Jesse fooling with us.<br> Go to sleep, Charley.<br> Morning.<br> Charley.<br> Bob, how much did you want to eat?<br> I'm feeling sort of peculiar.<br> Why is it you're looking so interested?<br> You think it's intelligent<br> to go out like that...<br> ...so all creation can see your guns?<br> Hi.<br> Come on, let's go see<br> what your mama's doing.<br> Timmy, get that door, would you?<br> - Well, you lost your shoe, sweetheart.<br> - Yeah, I did.<br> That's gonna be a problem.<br> They don't sell those one at a time.<br> We lost a shoe, Mama.<br> Will you put that up for Daddy,<br> would you?<br> - What you doing, you lose a shoe?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's only meant to go on top,<br> to complement.<br> Yeah, I know. Sometimes, I...<br> Bob, everything's getting cold!<br> - Where's Mary?<br> - She's outside, darling.<br> Mary?<br> What do you think goes on<br> in that noggin of his?<br> Nothing.<br> I was talking about his mind, not yours.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Oh, I get it.<br> Well, hello now.<br> "The arrest and confession<br> of Dick Liddil."<br> You don't say so.<br> That's very strange.<br> Says here Dick surrendered<br> three weeks ago.<br> You must have been<br> right in the neighborhood.<br> Well, apparently, they kept it a secret.<br> If I get to Kansas City soon,<br> I'll ask somebody about it.<br> You two ready?<br> I will be, by noon.<br> There is a ship<br> She sails the sea<br> She's loaded deep<br> As deep can be<br> But not as deep<br> As the love I'm in<br> I know not if I sink or swim<br> The water is wide<br> I can't cross o'er<br> And neither have I wings to fly<br> Give me a boat<br> That can carry two<br> Both shall row<br> My love and I<br> For love is gentle<br> And love is kind<br> Sweetest flower<br> When first it's new<br> But love grows old<br> And waxes cold<br> And fades away<br> Like the morning dew<br> There is a ship<br> She sails the sea<br> I guess I'll take my guns off...<br> ...for fear the neighbors might spy them.<br> Don't that picture look dusty?<br> What have...? What have you done?<br> Jesse.<br> Jesse?<br> Jesse? Jesse?<br> Jesse!<br> No!<br> No. Jess...<br> Come back. Oh, come back.<br> Oh, Jesse! No!<br> Oh, Bob. Have you done this?!<br> I swear to God I didn't.<br> It was an accident, Zee.<br> Come on. Pistol went off accidentally.<br> Put my name.<br> Why, what'd you do? I shot him.<br> You might wanna keep that.<br> Thank you all very much.<br> The resulting prints<br> sold for 2 dollars apiece...<br> ...and were the models for the lithographed<br> covers on a number of magazines.<br> Soon a thousand strangers were making<br> spellbound pilgrimages to the cottage...<br> ...or were venerating the iced remains<br> in Seidenfaden's cooling room.<br> The man who offered 30,000 dollars for<br> the body of President Garfield's assassin...<br> ...sent a telegram to City Marshal<br> Enos Craig offering 50,000...<br> ...for the body<br> of Jesse Woodson James...<br> ...so that he could go around the country<br> with it...<br> ...or at least sell it to P.T. Barnum<br> for his Greatest Show on Earth.<br> Another photograph was taken<br> of the renowned American bandit...<br> ...nestled in his bed of ice.<br> And it was this shot that was most<br> available in sundries and apothecaries...<br> ...to be viewed in a stereoscope<br> alongside the sphinx...<br> ...the Taj Mahal,<br> and the catacombs of Rome.<br> Hello, here!<br> "The arrest and confession<br> of Dick Liddil."<br> Young man, I thought you told me<br> you didn't know Dick had surrendered.<br> You mean he did? I didn't know.<br> But I knew I had not fooled him.<br> And he knew, as well as I, in that moment<br> that I intended to bring him to justice.<br> But he would not kill me<br> in the presence of his wife and children.<br> And so he was smiling<br> to throw me off-guard.<br> Well, it's all right, anyway, Bob.<br> It was widely felt that<br> Bob possessed some acting talent...<br> ...and Charley, not a jot.<br> That picture's awful dusty.<br> Charley was only expected<br> not to slouch or mutter...<br> ...and to transport his sicknesses<br> to the alley before letting them go.<br> And that's...<br> ...how I killed Jesse James.<br> By October of 1883, Bob Ford<br> could be identified correctly...<br> ...by more citizens than could<br> the president of the United States.<br> He was as renowned at 20 as Jesse was<br> after 14 years of grand larceny.<br> You won't get your hooks into me.<br> That's right. That's right.<br> Sit next to your boyfriend. Jezebel.<br> Charley was increasingly superstitious...<br> ...increasingly subject<br> to the advice of soothsayers...<br> ...who promised to cure his miseries<br> with pipe smoke and poultices.<br> You been spending too much time<br> with Gypsies, Charley.<br> Shit.<br> The picture's awful dusty.<br> Something began to change<br> in Charley's stage portrayal of Jesse.<br> His gait seemed more practiced.<br> His voice was spookily similar<br> to the man's.<br> His newly suggested dialogue<br> was analogous...<br> ...to a script Jesse might have originated.<br> He began to look at his younger brother<br> with spite...<br> ...as if he suspected that<br> in some future performance...<br> ...he might present himself<br> to a live cartridge in Robert Ford's gun.<br> Murderer!<br> Cur!<br> Coward!<br> You wanna investigate my courage?<br> Do you?<br> Find out! Find out!<br> Nobody.<br> Coward!<br> By his own approximation, Bob<br> assassinated Jesse James over 800 times.<br> He suspected no one in history<br> had ever so often or so publicly...<br> ...recapitulated an act of betrayal.<br> Bob always challenged<br> the allegations of cowardice...<br> ...but Charley seemed<br> to agree with them.<br> He spoke of Mrs. Zee James<br> as certain priests might the Madonna...<br> ...and composed long soul-describing letters<br> to her...<br> ...begging her forgiveness...<br> ...none of which he mailed.<br> Charley Ford became all that his countrymen<br> wanted an assassin of Jesse James to be.<br> Jesse James was a man<br> Who killed many men<br> He robbed the Glendale train<br> And he stole from the rich<br> And he gave to the poor<br> He had a hand<br> And a heart and a brain<br> Well, Jesse had a wife<br> To mourn for his life<br> Three children<br> They were brave<br> But that dirty little coward<br> Who shot Mr. Howard<br> Has laid Jesse James in his grave<br> It was Robert Ford<br> That dirty little coward<br> I wonder how does he feel<br> For he ate at Jesse's bread<br> And he slept in Jesse's bed<br> And he laid poor Jesse in his grave<br> Well, Jesse had a wife<br> To mourn for his life<br> Three children<br> They were brave<br> But that dirty little coward<br> Who shot Mr. Howard<br> Has laid poor Jesse in his grave<br> I'm Robert Ford.<br> It was two children, not three.<br> Hey.<br> You get yourself home, son, okay?<br> Come on. Get out of here.<br> Get out of my place.<br> He thought, at his angriest...<br> ...about visiting the kin<br> of Jesse's slaughtered victims:<br> Mrs. William Westfall in Plattsburg...<br> ...the Wymore family in Clay County...<br> ...perhaps even Mrs. Joseph Heywood<br> in Northfield, Minnesota.<br> He would go to their homes<br> and give his name as Robert Ford...<br> ...the man who killed Jesse James.<br> He imagined they would<br> be grateful to him.<br> It was only with Dorothy Evans<br> that Bob spoke revealingly or plainly...<br> ...and it was with her that he spoke of<br> things he didn't know he knew.<br> He told her that he had no real memory<br> of the shooting and its aftermath.<br> He could remember lifting the gun<br> that Jesse had given him...<br> ...and then it was Good Friday and he was<br> reading about the funeral proceedings...<br> ...as if they'd happened a long time ago.<br> Why did you kill him?<br> Well, he was gonna kill me.<br> So you were scared<br> and that's the only reason?<br> Yeah.<br> And the reward money.<br> Do you want me to change the subject?<br> You know what I expected?<br> Applause.<br> I was only 20 years old then.<br> I couldn't see how it would look to people.<br> I was surprised by what happened.<br> They didn't applaud.<br> He was ashamed of his boasting...<br> ...his pretensions of courage<br> and ruthlessness.<br> He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness,<br> his dispassion...<br> ...his inability to express<br> what he now believed was the case:<br> That he truly regretted killing Jesse...<br> ...that he missed the man<br> as much as anybody...<br> ...and wished his murder<br> hadn't been necessary.<br> Even as he circulated his saloon...<br> ...he knew that the smiles disappeared<br> when he passed by.<br> He received so many menacing letters...<br> ...that he could read them<br> without any reaction except curiosity.<br> He kept to his apartment all day,<br> flipping over playing cards...<br> ...looking at his destiny<br> in every king and jack.<br> Edward O'Kelly came up from Bachelor<br> at 1 p.m. on the 8th.<br> He had no grand scheme, no strategy...<br> ...no agreement with higher authorities...<br> ...nothing beyond<br> a vague longing for glory...<br> ...and a generalized wish<br> for revenge against Robert Ford.<br> - How'd it go last night?<br> - Not so bad.<br> The other one.<br> Edward O'Kelly would be ordered<br> to serve a life sentence...<br> ...in the Colorado Penitentiary<br> for second-degree murder.<br> Over 7000 signatures<br> would eventually be gathered...<br> ...on a petition asking for<br> O'Kelly's release...<br> ...and in 1902, Governor James B. Orman<br> would pardon the man.<br> You shouldn't be wearing that stickpin<br> again there, Bob. Opals are unlucky.<br> My luck's not very good as it is. I don't<br> think an opal's gonna change that much.<br> I hear you.<br> There would be no eulogies for Bob...<br> ...no photographs of his body<br> would be sold in sundries stores...<br> ...no people would crowd the streets<br> in the rain to see his funeral cortege...<br> ...no biographies would be written<br> about him...<br> ...no children named after him.<br> No one would ever pay 25 cents<br> to stand in the rooms he grew up in.<br> Hello, Bob.<br> The shotgun would ignite,<br> and Ella Mae would scream...<br> ...but Robert Ford would only lay<br> on the floor and look at the ceiling...<br> ...the light going out of his eyes...<br> ...before he could find the right words.<br>
