I keep forgetting to use it.<br> Keep forgetting to use it.<br> - How ya doing, pal? You awake yet?<br> - Getting there.<br> Tillie, I am tired of waiting.<br> You're making us late!<br> He's speaking to you, young lady.<br> You're gonna go through this<br> with your chin held high.<br> You're gonna come out the other side<br> and you're gonna be fine.<br> Do you hear me?<br> I expect only the best from you.<br> (man) Tillie, I am waiting!<br> (knocking)<br> Just a minute.<br> Come in.<br> - Have a good trip, Tillie.<br> - I'll try.<br> Ain't you gonna say anything?<br> So long, Tillie.<br> I am doing this because<br> I care for you and your future.<br> - Hard as that may be for you to believe.<br> - It's very hard, Father.<br> Hopefully your aunt<br> will know how to raise you.<br> I confess I don't. I'm not a mother.<br> I did the best I could<br> under the circumstances.<br> Under the circumstances, so did l.<br> Hopefully you will return with a new<br> attitude and a new sense of responsibility.<br> I sincerely hope so.<br> - A nine?<br> - Yeah.<br> Pull it over.<br> Don't want to carry it.<br> - Starboard weight is going around here.<br> - All right.<br> Thanks, Jimmy.<br> - See you in Boise.<br> - See you in Boise.<br> Take care.<br> Meet me tonight, around seven.<br> - Tony?<br> - Yeah?<br> - Come over for a second.<br> - Should I bring my kit?<br> (worker) Yeah, do bring your kit.<br> - What's that?<br> - Lunch.<br> I was making one for Jimmy.<br> I thought I'd make one for you too.<br> - Are you flying on Thursday?<br> - Schedule isn't out yet.<br> If you're not,<br> I was gonna invite you to dinner.<br> I'm making turkey with chestnut stuffing,<br> an old family recipe.<br> I'll probably get one run, for sure.<br> Thursday's Thanksgiving.<br> - You never know around here.<br> - (man) Edgar.<br> Yeah.<br> Edgar, I'm not after your heart and soul,<br> I'm just trying to be friendly.<br> I know that, Rose.<br> I was kind of getting the idea<br> that you liked me.<br> Oh, I like you.

You're almost at gross.<br> - How many sacks?<br> - Only six.<br> - Why's she so heavy?<br> - Didn't they tell you? You got a passenger.<br> - Who's the pilot?<br> - Oh, name is Edgar Anscombe.<br> - I suppose he's qualified?<br> - As far as I know.<br> Aren't you sure?<br> You mean does he have a thick logbook<br> with lots of hours in it? Yes.<br> However, logbooks can<br> sometimes be works of fiction.<br> I asked him certain questions, he<br> answered them correctly, so I hired him.<br> - I see.<br> - Morning, Edgar.<br> This is Mr Hansen. He owns Farmers Bank<br> account along with most of my airplanes.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Hello.<br> - Maybe you've read his sign.<br> - Yeah.<br> This is his daughter Tillie. She's going<br> to be flying with you this morning.<br> We have some details to discuss,<br> Mr Hansen.<br> Do you mind waiting outside by the plane?<br> It's number 14. Number's on the tail.<br> Come along, Tillie.<br> Can't she take the train<br> like everybody else?<br> Maybe the family is air-minded or maybe<br> she saw Buddy Rogers in Wings.<br> Maybe her father owns your airplanes.<br> She's 105 pounds of airfreight<br> in a month when averages are down.<br> I was considering mailing the phone books<br> to Pasco just to raise them.<br> She suits my needs better.<br> Want your weather?<br> Twin Falls and Boise<br> are calling overcast at 500.<br> Occasional breaks.<br> Visibility obscured to the west.<br> They don't know anything.<br> If you can't find a hole,<br> try to be back by 11.<br> I can train the mail and avoid<br> nasty phone calls from the postmaster.<br> Hey, you forgot this.<br> You think some guy's going to fly<br> beside me and hold me up?<br> It's regulation, you know that. These<br> bureaucrats are very sensitive people.<br> I wouldn't want them snooping around<br> and finding we didn't take them seriously.<br> Well, I'm a pilot, not a babysitter.<br> I know how you feel.<br> I even think I understand why.<br> But you've gotta remember that<br> passengers are the future of this business.<br> We're never gonna make<br> money hauling mail.<br> We have to learn to haul human beings,<br> and that includes you.<br> Have a good trip.<br> - Your airplane's leaking.<br> - Don't touch anything, OK?<br> Father, the thing is a wreck.<br> - Come on, get in.

You're not<br> going up in a scary piece of junk...<br> Go on, Tillie! These men have<br> a schedule to keep like everybody else.<br> I can do it myself, thank you very much!<br> (MrHansen) Mr Anscombe?<br> She is an affliction, but God made her<br> that way, for reasons known only to Him.<br> - How long do you stop at Boise?<br> - About 20 minutes.<br> I'd appreciate you keeping an eye on her.<br> Also, make sure that<br> she meets her aunt in Pasco.<br> - What's she going to do?<br> - Run away, possibly.<br> She is capable of anything.<br> I say this to you man to man,<br> if you know what I mean.<br> - I'll get her to Pasco anyway.<br> - Thanks.<br> Tillie, have a good flight.<br> If you gotta go potty, go now.<br> Once we're up we don't come down.<br> No? OK.<br> - When will they arrive?<br> - They'll have headwinds for sure.<br> when they land at Pasco if you like.<br> - I'd appreciate that.<br> - You don't have to worry.<br> They disappear at this end<br> and after a certain amount of time<br> they reappear at the other - it's quite safe.<br> Hey, kid, did you ever do this before?<br> Get down.<br> Here we go!<br> (thumping)<br> Pretty.<br> (gasps)<br> - Where are we?<br> - Starting down for Boise.<br> - I don't see anything.<br> - Don't worry, it's down there.<br> (she gasps)<br> (Edgar) Boise.<br> (worker) About three more.<br> That's fine with me.<br> - Hey, Jimmy.<br> - Hey, pal.<br> - You get a coffee.

OK?<br> I was just trying to pass the time.<br> Have you always been a pilot?<br> Mm-hm. I got my licence<br> when I was one year old<br> and I've been flying commercially<br> since I was three and a half.<br> Are you married?<br> Where I come from, you don't ask personal<br> questions about people you don't know.<br> Where I come from, people are civil,<br> especially employees to customers.<br> No. I'm not married and I don't plan to be.<br> How about you?<br> - I feel the same way.<br> - I think that's wise.<br> Considering the way<br> you get along with men.<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> - Your father wanted to smack you in Elko.<br> He smacks me all the time.<br> That's his idea of how to be a father.<br> This is all his idea. He's sending me up<br> to Seattle to stay with the Howards.<br> They have a son, William,<br> my second cousin. He's in medical school.<br> He's no looker. They're trying to match us.<br> I've no interest in him or any other boy.<br> How did you get that scar?<br> (sighs)<br> Moravia says you're the future of aviation.<br> - Who's Moravia?<br> - He's my boss in Elko.<br> I hope he's wrong.<br> If you're the future, I don't like it.<br> You're 105 pounds of freight...<br> Freight doesn't talk.<br> (man) Boys, can you take<br> advantage of that fishing?<br> (man) Yeah, good fishing.<br> (customers chatter)<br> - Can I have that doughnut, please?<br> - Edgar, the lady wants your doughnut.<br> - She can't have it.<br> - You can't have it.<br> - I don't see his name on it. How much?<br> - A nickel. I'll cut it in half.<br> It's impolite to read at the table.<br> - Hey, Stiller?<br> - Yeah?<br> - You got a call.<br> - Hold on a minute.<br> - It's your boss.<br> - I'll be right there.<br> - You're dripping.<br> - What?<br> You're dripping jelly all over the place.<br> Look, you don't wanna be here<br> and I sure as hell don't want you here.<br> We got another two hours<br> and 10 minutes to Pasco,<br> and then we don't have to see<br> each other again, OK?<br> - Fine with me.<br> - Fine.<br> Yes, sir, I just changed them.<br> OK, I'll pick up a couple of sets.<br> See you in Elko.<br> (dripping sound)<br> (engine splutters)<br> - What's happening?<br> - I've got to set it down. Get down!<br> Goddamn it!<br> Come on, baby, climb for me.<br> (engine stops)<br> (he groans)<br> Hey, are you all right?<br> Hey?<br> Hey, kid? Tillie?<br> (coughing)<br> Easy.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I'm all right. Leave me alone.<br> - Hey, kid, sit down.<br> - I don't wanna sit down.<br> Where are you going? Come back.<br> You just crashed in an airplane.<br> - I know what I just did!<br> - Suit yourself.<br> (piercing scream)<br> - Don't do that!<br> - I'll do it if I want to.<br> - What are you looking at?<br> - That river.<br> - What about it?<br> - Which one is it?<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe it's a fork of the Snake.<br> - People live along rivers.<br> - So?<br> So, we ought to climb down there.<br> How do you get down there in one piece?<br> We'll stay up by the wreck, that's the rule.<br> They can see a wreck from the air,<br> they can't see people.<br> - Go up and sit down.<br> - I could make it if I had to.<br> Say you did.<br> You gotta walk maybe 15, 20 miles<br> to the nearest place.<br> You've got no food, no equipment...<br> Just sit down.<br> Are you going to argue<br> with everything I say?<br> - I may.<br> - Hey, kid.<br> - You ever crash in an airplane before?<br> - No.<br> - I have.<br> - So?<br> - I got experience and you don't.<br> - You're a two-time loser is all it means.<br> - You're blaming this on me?<br> - You're the pilot.<br> Do you know what I had to do<br> to get that plane through the trees,<br> so we didn't wrap ourselves up in a ball?<br> - I know it wasn't my fault.<br> - Yeah? Let's consider that.<br> That heap that was an airplane<br> had a Wright J-Five engine in it.<br> It's the most dependable aircraft engine.<br> Lindbergh crossed the ocean behind one.<br> We've never had one<br> go wrong on this line until today.<br> So who's the jinx? What's different about<br> this trip on this day but you, kid?<br> Stop yelling at me.<br> You're a prize.<br> You're a real goddamn prize.<br> How do you like it?<br> Separate quarters.<br> Ladies in there and gents out here.<br> - So we don't have to see each other.<br> - Fine with me.<br> Hey! What do you smell? Gasoline!<br> Light it! See how far<br> you can fly without an airplane.<br> Stupid little brat!<br> I don't fly passengers!<br> If you hear anything, call me.<br> Good. All right.<br> Hello, this is Moravia at Elko.<br> Give me station 36, will you, please?<br> This should be fun. The guy's a lush.<br> I don't know if it's an emergency.<br> It may and it may not. I don't know yet.<br> Operator, just do your job<br> and let me get on with mine!<br> Jesus Christ!<br> (ringing)<br> Number 36. Whaddaya want?<br> A plane?! I can't even see the track!<br> How do you expect me<br> to see a goddamn airplane?<br> All right.<br> The answer to your question's no.<br> I don't see nobody.<br> On the other hand, number 12<br> came through half an hour ago.<br> Triple headed with 57 cars.<br> That's a pretty good haul, this time of year,<br> if you know anything about railroading.<br> State trooper's got nothing.<br> They're putting out the word.<br> What about aircraft? What's available?<br> OK. I called the National Guard<br> at Spokane.<br> They got three DH4s they'll lend us.<br> They don't know when they can get out.<br> They're socked in.<br> They're calling overcast<br> and snow flurries in the morning.<br> I got a private Waco Taper Wing at Boise<br> and maybe a guy with a Fleet.<br> Only his phone's down.<br> If the Guards get out we'll have 'em work<br> south. Our planes will stage through Boise.<br> If the weather holds.<br> This is one call I don't wanna make.<br> Have the operator get me Bruno Hansen.<br> Saw your fire. I'm cold.<br> - What's that?<br> - Oil.<br> What for?<br> Make smoke, in case a plane<br> comes over tomorrow.<br> We have a fire. If we had some food<br> we could almost live up here.<br> - You got a gun.<br> - This is accurate to about 50 feet.<br> It might hit something<br> if it stood there waiting for you.<br> You could try. I'm hungry.<br> - Then they'll find us, that's all.<br> - Mm.<br> My father has friends in the State House.<br> He'll move heaven and earth,<br> as will the Howards of Seattle,<br> who have entertained<br> the governor ofWashington.<br> Well, maybe all those nice folks<br> will come out and look for us.<br> Except they'll be looking about 60 miles<br> south of where I should have been.<br> I was taking a short cut<br> over the mountains to Pasco,<br> to get rid of you,<br> instead of turning back to Boise.<br> They'll find us. Next spring<br> they'll take us down in two blocks of ice.<br> - I can't listen.<br> - That's the truth.<br> You want me to lie, like you're a kid?<br> Hey! You wanted a way to talk to the pilot<br> so you know where you are.<br> I'll tell you.<br> You called me a two-time loser.<br> - It was just an expression.<br> - Well, you're right.<br> You're absolutely right.<br> Last time I crashed like this I killed a man.<br> George Toomey, eighteen years old.<br> A perfectly good human being<br> till I killed him.<br> Maybe you didn't wanna know that.<br> You're not the jinx. It's me.<br> Big thing you did wrong today<br> was to go flying with me.<br> Now you know where you are.<br> (gasps)<br> You better not hit me.<br> Why would I do that?<br> What good would that do?<br> Jimmy?<br> You heard?<br> What happened, Jimmy?<br> Sorry to say,<br> he may have picked up some ice.<br> Could have got stuck over the clouds<br> with no way down.<br> - Who's in there with Moravia?<br> - Mr Hansen, the banker.<br> His daughter's with Edgar.<br> Well, we may as well get in.<br> I was thinking I oughta stick around.<br> - I got your dinner in the oven.<br> - I don't know, Ev.<br> Everybody else is staying.<br> Maybe I should too.<br> They don't pay you<br> to sit around and worry.<br> If they need you they'll call.<br> That's what we put the telephone in for.<br> Think of that poor girl,<br> up there on a night like this.<br> I'm thinking about Edgar.<br> (bird calls)<br> - Morning, kid.<br> - Morning.<br> Management regrets they're out<br> of cornflakes and French toast.<br> - Here.<br> - What is it?<br> Pine-needle tea.<br> Jesus.<br> (sawing)<br> - It's nice and clear today.<br> - The wind shifted to the west.<br> - What are you making?<br> - A snare.<br> - Can I help?<br> - No, thanks.<br> I grew up round boys.<br> I know something about hand tools.<br> I even know how to shoot a gun.<br> - Are you still mad about last night?<br> - I'm not mad about anything.<br> - I sure didn't do it on purpose.<br> - Didn't say you did, did l?<br> Anyway, I'm sorry.<br> - Change your mind about leaving?<br> - Nope.<br> What are you gonna do with that thing?<br> - I'm gonna try some hunting.<br> - I said you ought to do that last night.<br> I just think it's always better<br> to do something than sit around.<br> - On the basis of your vast experience?<br> - That's right.<br> What should I do?<br> If a plane comes over, put oil on the fire.<br> Don't let it go out.<br> Can you handle that?<br> (bird calls)<br> (chuckles)<br> - Hey, kid, guess what? I nailed one.<br> - What?<br> I shot a rabbit.<br> Hope you can cook.<br> Easy, fella.<br> Here you go.<br> (screams)<br> (shot)<br> Mr Anscombe?<br> Mr Anscombe!<br> - What happened?<br> - Goddamn wolves.<br> I had a rabbit too.<br> - You better close that up.<br> - I know what I have to do.<br> Get me your bag.<br> Take it off.<br> (he winces)<br> - What are you looking for?<br> - The needle and thread.<br> Here.<br> I'll do it. You can't reach. I'll do it!<br> - Bleed to death and tell me you can!<br> - Do it!<br> Well?<br> You're one of a kind, Tillie.<br> You can do anything you put your mind to.<br> (winces)<br> What would you have done<br> if I wasn't here?<br> - You don't like to talk much, do you?<br> - You don't have that problem, do you?<br> No. No, I talk all the time.<br> I'm a flibbertigibbet. That's what<br> my English teacher, Mrs Wilson, calls me.<br> "Tillie Hansen, you are a flibbertigibbet."<br> (he groans)<br> Sounds like a noise<br> a chicken would make.<br> Mrs Wilson kinda looks like a chicken.<br> - How come you ain't screaming?<br> - I am. You just can't hear me.<br> - All right, that's enough.<br> - One more stitch.<br> - Don't argue with me.<br> - One more stitch.<br> Just tie that off.<br> Pull it through. Tie it right there.<br> Jeez!<br> All right. Here, get... Just put that on.<br> - Here.<br> - All right.<br> That's it. Oh, come on, easy!<br> Do it tight.<br> What was that you were saying before<br> to yourself, "You're one of a kind"?<br> I sometimes hear my mother talking to me.<br> Talking to you? Is she dead?<br> Yeah. She used to say things like that<br> when I was down about something.<br> - Here.<br> - OK.<br> Sorry.<br> There you go.<br> If I start foaming at the mouth,<br> just shoot me, OK?<br> Found something.<br> - Here.<br> - I lost my appetite.<br> Have it later.<br> (howling)<br> Do you hear those wolves?<br> They're all around here now.<br> They're not going anywhere.<br> They don't have anything better to do.<br> - Will they come over here?<br> - No.<br> You did OK.<br> It's good.<br> I can understand your point of view.<br> Now listen to mine.<br> Someday the world will be entirely<br> populated with bureaucrats such as you<br> because real people will do away<br> with themselves out of frustration.<br> I myself do not want anything out of you.<br> They do. They wanna be rescued.<br> This is what they would say<br> if they could speak themselves.<br> - What's it look like?<br> - There's a hole over the Tuscarora mine.<br> - The whole front's breaking up.<br> - Everybody go! Let's go!<br> On the double!<br> Well, at least the search is on.<br> - Is that everyone?<br> - One more. Stiller.<br> He's bringing the mail from Pasco.<br> He knows to keep his eyes open.<br> Got about two hours of light left.<br> What a mess.<br> - Then let's go down the cliff.<br> - Ha!<br> - Why do you do that?<br> - We can't make it, that's why.<br> (howling)<br> Those wolves are gonna hang around.<br> Anyway, we were dead<br> the minute the engine quit.<br> - I didn't wanna say anything.<br> - Why talk that way?<br> - It's the truth.<br> - It ain't. It's what you think'll happen.<br> - You made a snare and shot a rabbit.<br> - So what?<br> I'd rather be trying things<br> than sitting on my butt.<br> (howling)<br> All right. All right.<br> Let's go if we're going.<br> Take what you need.<br> I was thinking more like<br> a couple of sweaters.<br> (snarling and growling)<br> (sniffing and whining)<br> See? I told you I grew up with boys.<br> Jesus.<br> - Do you live by yourself?<br> - Yeah, that's right.<br> - Don't you have any friends?<br> - None in particular.<br> - Who drove you to work?<br> - Where did you see him?<br> Out the window of Mr Moravia's office.<br> I don't miss much.<br> That's Stiller, a guy I work with.<br> - How about that woman?<br> - What woman?<br> The one that gave you the lunch.<br> That's Rose, Stiller's sister.<br> - Is she your pash?<br> - My what?<br> Your passion.<br> I don't know. When you're...<br> when you're flying all the time,<br> you don't really have<br> much of a chance with women.<br> I think you hide behind that scar too much.<br> - You ever do anything with her?<br> - What do you mean, "do anything"?<br> You know what "do anything" means.<br> You're blushing. Your veins'll be too close<br> to the skin. I've known people like that.<br> I'm hungry.<br> (aircraft engine)<br> Hey! Hey! Wait a minute!<br> - It's Stiller! Hey!<br> - Hey!<br> - Jimmy! Hey!<br> - Hey! Hey!<br> - Jimmy, over here!<br> - Hey! Aah!<br> - Hey, Tillie.<br> - Dammit!<br> - Did he see us? Is he coming back?<br> - Forget it.<br> - What's up?<br> - Don't touch me!<br> Don't touch me!<br> - I didn't expect this to happen.<br> - Yeah, sure!<br> We've only got 50 yards to the bottom.<br> Now, let's move.<br> - Come on!<br> - I can't move.<br> - What?<br> - I can't move.<br> All right, let me look.<br> (screams)<br> It's probably broken. Great!<br> (she groans)<br> - Here, take one of these.<br> - What is it?<br> - A pain pill.<br> - I don't want it.<br> - Shut up and take it.<br> - I don't want it!<br> Now I'll have to think of something else.<br> We're going to lower you down.<br> - How?<br> - Go back to the wreck for some cable.<br> - You can't go back up there.<br> - I'll just have to.<br> Just sit here and shut up.<br> Can you do that?<br> - It'll be dark soon.<br> - You afraid of the dark?<br> I was thinking of you coming back down.<br> Hey, kid... I'm sorry.<br> - Ow.<br> - I'll get you down in the morning.<br> - Did it look like an airplane?<br> - Can't say for sure.<br> - What can you say for sure?<br> - It was a flash out the corner of my eye.<br> It might have been wings,<br> it might have been a couple of trees.<br> Could you have gone back to make sure?<br> It's pretty hard to tell<br> one ridge from the other.<br> Besides, I was running low on gas<br> and worried about getting back myself.<br> - Show me on the map.<br> - Well, that was the other problem.<br> My compass was messing up on me.<br> I didn't know where I was.<br> Not until I saw the rail line running<br> into Baker, somewhere around here.<br> You let your pilots fly<br> without knowing where they are?<br> The wind blew me down there. You can't<br> always tell what the wind's going to do.<br> You're talking about hundreds of square<br> miles - and suppose you were wrong?<br> You'd be responsible for sending<br> everybody in the wrong direction.<br> You were right to report the sighting.<br> But you see the problems it caused.<br> What do you think I should do?<br> (car engine and klaxon)<br> My wife.<br> All right, sit by the phone.<br> I'll call you if I need you.<br> Now that I've seen your company<br> in operation, Mr Moravia,<br> I do not think much of the men you hire.<br> I can see why you might<br> think that, Mr Hansen.<br> Stiller thinks mainly of his own ass.<br> Anscombe has half a face.<br> And myself, I have a leg made out<br> of Philippine mahogany.<br> Look around a little more,<br> you'll find Probosky, my chief mechanic.<br> He's missing three fingers due to a jenny<br> propeller and an over-anxious student.<br> Carson, that pilot you met, was shot down<br> in the war, spent the night in a fox hole,<br> and he breathed some mustard gas,<br> which left him with one lung.<br> All of us should have gotten out<br> of this business a long time ago.<br> The only problem is, in addition<br> to being cripples, we're all addicts.<br> Flying is all we care to do.<br> Stiller.<br> If I fire him and no one employs him -<br> no one would, who has any choice...<br> ...Stiller would wither and die...<br> as we all would.<br> As I would.<br> Therefore, considering<br> we are all cripples and addicts,<br> I'm of the opinion we're doing<br> as good a job as could be expected.<br> If you have any complaints,<br> take 'em to your congressman.<br> While you're doing that,<br> ask him for some more money.<br> Some more rotating beacons.<br> Twin-engine planes that climb over the<br> mountains instead of going through them.<br> Some radios so we don't have to spit into<br> the wind to find which way we're going.<br> Besides from that, don't tell me<br> how to do my job, Mr Hansen.<br> I don't tell you how to do yours.<br> (howling)<br> - It hurts.<br> - I know.<br> Take your mind off it. Think about<br> something else, something nice.<br> - Like what?<br> - I don't know. Anything nice.<br> How about that boy up in Seattle?<br> There ain't no boy in Seattle.<br> - There isn't?<br> - I made that up.<br> - Why did you do that?<br> - How should I know?<br> I don't know half the reasons I do things.<br> The only boyfriend I ever had<br> banged me on the floor of a caboose<br> in a Western Pacific rail yard.<br> - Watch your language.<br> - That is the right language.<br> Sure wasn't love.<br> He promised he would take me to Reno.<br> But he lied.<br> Then my father found out about it<br> and there was this big scandal.<br> He decided to get me out of town<br> as fast as he could.<br> That's why I was in the mail plane<br> in the middle of winter.<br> That was OK because they didn't want<br> to see me. I didn't want to see them either.<br> Don't cry, Tillie, you're not the type.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Sh...<br> Underneath.<br> You're the one that called me a jinx.<br> Yeah, but I took that back, didn't l?<br> My father... My father told me<br> I was spoiled merchandise.<br> - That I was ruined for life.<br> - You're all right.<br> Somebody's going to snap you up,<br> wait and see.<br> You saw what happened in Boise.<br> What happened?<br> Didn't you see all the guys in the diner<br> breaking their necks to look you over?<br> - I didn't see that.<br> - Sure.<br> How often does a girl like you<br> come into a place like that anyway?<br> Now, you see, in the morning<br> we'll take the old elevator down...<br> and we'll be on our way.<br> I wish it could have been you.<br> (wolves howl)<br> It would have been better.<br> You go to sleep.<br> (dog barking)<br> I think you should go back.<br> Back where?<br> He wasn't even sure where he was.<br> - What if it was them?<br> - He wasn't sure.<br> You did the right thing.<br> Let the National Guard go look.<br> - It's what they're there for.<br> - Ladies, would you mind holding it down?<br> I'm trying to think.<br> - What if it was my brother that was down?<br> - Now, quit!<br> I don't even want to think about that.<br> - Edgar'd go after him.<br> - You don't know that for sure.<br> I think he would.<br> You marry a mail-plane pilot, see how<br> anxious you are to send him off in one.<br> When the time comes, we all have to take<br> care of each other. Nobody else will.<br> You'd hold your breath every time he left<br> and wouldn't let it out<br> until he'd come home.<br> I hate airplanes.<br> I don't even know what keeps them up.<br> They're made out of sticks and bed sheets.<br> Why don't they just open up in two<br> and drop Jimmy like a stone into water?<br> That's right, Evelyn, you don't<br> understand anything about it.<br> You've never done it.<br> You don't know why I do it.<br> So would you please<br> just hold it down and let me think?<br> OK?<br> That's Capital Peak.<br> Now, what's Edgar doing there?<br> (mutters wearily)<br> Easy. Easy.<br> I'll give you another pill.<br> (howling)<br> - You can't carry me all day.<br> - Don't talk with your mouth full.<br> - You can't, we both know that.<br> - I'm not gonna carry you.<br> You should just leave me here.<br> Go on ahead and if you find somebody<br> send them back for me.<br> Just when I'm getting used to you?<br> - You mean that?<br> - Yeah, I mean that.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm going to make a travois.<br> The thing the lndians used to use<br> to carry stuff around in the wintertime.<br> Pretty smart.<br> Well, a pilot's gotta be.<br> Put yourself down in a field someplace,<br> it's up to you to get yourself out.<br> National Guard de Havillands got out<br> after problems with their plumbing.<br> Why are you here? I didn't call you.<br> - Been thinking it over, Mr Moravia.<br> - That's always a good sign.<br> It had to be them. I know where they are.<br> I'll get back to you, Frank.<br> Here, show me on the map.<br> (Stiller) I figured I must<br> have been around here.<br> But I couldn't understand<br> what Edgar was doing there.<br> Then I realised,<br> if he was fighting the weather,<br> and wound up somewhere east<br> of the mountains, about here,<br> he'd have a straight shot<br> over the mountains into Pasco.<br> He must have took the chance<br> that he had enough gas.<br> You always take chances like that?<br> If not, the mail wouldn't get through.<br> - This is Capital Peak.<br> - They must be on this ridge.<br> About halfway down the big saddle,<br> there's a clearing in the timber.<br> What I saw must have been wings.<br> Get the mail out by train.<br> He'll take out number eight.<br> Go as quickly as you can.<br> You'll have company. I'm sending<br> everyone up as soon as they refuel.<br> - He comes through after all.<br> - Yeah. Yeah.<br> Maybe our luck is changing.<br> Jim.<br> - (Tillie) We could get married.<br> - What makes you say that?<br> I cancelled the letters out in our names.<br> You ever do that?<br> You write some boy's last name<br> and then yours underneath,<br> and you cross out the letters<br> that are the same.<br> If there are a lot of crosses,<br> you can get married. A lot of ours do.<br> I don't know, kid. I'm too old for you.<br> I'm 31. How old are you?<br> Almost 17. Means when I'm 21,<br> you'll be almost 36. That ain't so bad.<br> - Edgar, I have to pee.<br> - Oh, God!<br> How are you back there, Tillie?<br> - Hey, I'm pulling. You talk.<br> - It hurts too much. You talk.<br> It's hard for me.<br> I haven't had a lot of practice at it.<br> When I was a kid up in Michigan,<br> we'd go hunting.<br> For three days we'd not say<br> ten words to each other.<br> Everybody just does what has to be done.<br> - Never told you about my first instructor.<br> - No.<br> His name's Sloaniger.<br> God, he could talk.<br> He'd yell at me, scare me to death.<br> I was all thumbs for a while,<br> the way you are.<br> Dammit, he stuck with me. Phew!<br> You know, he finally sent me off soloing.<br> I cried. It's true.<br> Before, I never felt I belonged anywhere<br> and my parents didn't bother with me.<br> I kinda grew up all over the place.<br> That day I was up there<br> by myself and I was just...<br> weaving through clouds and...<br> I knew that I belonged... someplace.<br> You know what I mean, Tillie?<br> I don't think that...<br> I don't think there's anything in the world<br> that's more important than that.<br> - Hey! What are you doing that for?<br> - Because I care about you.<br> Put that down.<br> You can't make it dragging me.<br> - You look like a jerk.<br> - You know me. I'll do what I say.<br> What is this, your mother<br> talking to you or something?<br> My mother's dead and we're here.<br> You'll never make it if you have to take me.<br> You don't want me anyway.<br> Is that what you think?<br> If you think that, then just do it.<br> What the hell.<br> Don't try to rattle me.<br> Your father gave me 20 bucks<br> to keep you from running,<br> but if you wanna do that, that's fine.<br> Blow your guts out all over the mountain.<br> See if I care.<br> Tillie, don't move!<br> I won't get any further alone. If you hadn't<br> been with me, I wouldn't have got this far.<br> I would've sat down<br> on that first night by the fire<br> and waited for the snow to cover me over.<br> Tillie... I don't wanna<br> go back there without you.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Edgar.<br> - What?<br> What is that?<br> Oh, my God, I think...<br> that's a telephone line.<br> Look, you just stay here<br> and I'll be back as soon as I can.<br> All right?<br> I'll go see.<br> Hey! Hey, mister, can I use your phone?<br> Hey, who are you?<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm a pilot that crashed.<br> Airplanes ain't safe.<br> Airplanes ain't dependable.<br> Look what happened to you.<br> Put that down. That's railroad property.<br> - Mister, I gotta eat something.<br> - Put that down!<br> You roach. It's been a home for me,<br> man and boy, for 50 years.<br> They still got a place<br> for me on the railroad.<br> Mister, I got a kid who's hurt bad.<br> I gotta take her something to eat.<br> - Leave it be!<br> - I'll pay for 'em.<br> You drop 'em.<br> Now you get outta here.<br> Take it easy. Just take it easy.<br> You know you ain't gonna make it.<br> (rustling)<br> (gunshot)<br> Damn!<br> (Tillie) Edgar!<br> No!<br> (Tillie screaming)<br> Help!<br> (screaming)<br> Come on, Tillie, you can do it!<br> (wolf whines)<br> (worker) Come on, guys!<br> - Let's get out there.<br> - I'm with ya.<br> - OK, let's get her.<br> - Hey, there's Edgar!<br> Move the stretcher over here.<br> - There we go.<br> - I've got you.<br> (cheering)<br> - Over here.<br> - Let her breathe.<br> - I got her!<br> - Give her some room!<br> - Watch your step, Edgar.<br> - Come on down.<br> (men chatter excitedly)<br> - Daddy!<br> - Don't talk. Everything is fine.<br> You don't have to go<br> anywhere you don't want to.<br> I wanna go home.<br> (chuckles) Daniel... and George.<br> You really had me scared there, you know.<br> Gently, boys.<br> Edgar!<br> Mr Anscombe, thanks.<br> Sorry I never got her to Pasco.<br> I wanna see Edgar alone.<br> You are going to the hospital, young lady.<br> I wouldn't argue with her, sir.<br> It's not worth it.<br> That's what people do<br> when they love each other, isn't it?<br> I'll never forget you.<br> Go to the hospital now.<br> - You'll come and see me?<br> - I guarantee it.<br> - Now I suppose you want some time off?<br> - A day or two.<br> Well...<br> Take Thanksgiving.<br> srt by OlFa<br>
