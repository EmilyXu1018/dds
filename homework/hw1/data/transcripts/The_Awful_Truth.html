                        Come on, get that sun lamp ready.<br> About 15 minutes is the most l'd advise,<br> Mr. Warriner.<br> Fifteen minutes nothing! l need<br> a deep Florida tan if it takes all afternoon.<br> Give her the gun.<br> All aboard for Miami,<br> Palm Beach and Point South.<br> -Hi, Jerry.<br> -Hello, Frank.<br> -How goes it?<br> -Fine!<br> -Like to play a little squash?<br> -No, thanks.<br> You're awfully white-skinned<br> for a guy who spent two weeks in Florida.<br> -That's what l thought.<br> -What did you do there, carry a parasol?<br> -Or didn't you go?<br> -Don't go spreading that around, Frank.<br> Pulling a fast one on the little wife?<br> Frank, l'm surprised at you.<br> l'm supposed to have been in Florida.<br> Supposing one of Lucy's friends<br> says to her:<br> ''Well, why isn't he tanned?''<br> Lucy will be embarrassed.<br> l'll be tanned,<br> and Lucy won't be embarrassed.<br> What wives don't know won't hurt them.<br> What you don't know won't hurt you.<br> l don't want to know.<br> How about coming by the house?<br> Some friends are coming by<br> for a late breakfast.<br> l got a better idea. Come to my place<br> for eggnogs and breakfast...<br> and maybe later we can duck the women<br> and play some golf.<br> -Swell, boy, you got me convinced.<br> -Okay.<br> -See you later, Jerry.<br> -So long, Frank.<br> Come on in!<br> Hey, Lucy!<br> That man is here.<br> Maybe she wasn't expecting you.<br> No, she's around somewhere.<br> Put your things down anywhere.<br> -Hello, Celeste.<br> -Hello, Mr. Warriner, you look well.<br> Thank you, Celeste, and vice versa.<br> Where's Mrs. Warriner? Look what l got her<br> all the way from Florida.<br> -She's out.<br> -She's out?<br> Never mind. Go get some eggnogs,<br> and we'll find something to drink to.<br> Come on, gang, enter.<br> Mr. Smith, look who's here.<br> Come on, boy.<br> Where's Mamma?<br> Look, l've got something for you.<br> Come on, get it.<br> What are you doing, reading my mail?<br> Several letters there for your wife.<br> Yesterday's, too.<br> l hope Lucy comes back<br> looking as well as you do.<br> She's probably up at her Aunt Patsy's.<br> She always goes there when she's lonely.<br> Thank you, Celeste, l'll take it up from here.<br> -Jerry.<br> -What?<br> Supposing Aunt Patsy wasn't home?<br> l get it. l'm up to my neck in funny people!<br> Seriously, l wish Lucy would go out and<br> get some fun now and again. Do her good.<br> That's the trouble with marriages today.<br> People are always imagining things.<br> The road to Reno is paved with suspicions.<br> First thing you know,<br> they're in a divorce court.<br> The broad-minded man from the Rio Grande!<br> lf you think l'll get a chance to prove my<br> broad-mindedness any minute, you're crazy.<br> Lucy's up at her Aunt Patsy's cabin.<br> l'll bet on it.<br> lncidentally, what a swell spot that is.<br> Good fishing....<br> Sometimes, on a clear day across that lake,<br> you can see for....<br> Mrs. Barnsley, Miss Heath,<br> Mr. Barnsley, Mr. Randall.<br> Aunt Patsy.<br> Any idea where Lucy is?<br> You know, she invited me to this--<br> -Darling!<br> -Hello, dear!<br> How grand and brown you are!<br> Hello, Patsy, dear.<br> -Did you miss me? Been thinking about me?<br> -Look what l brought you!<br> All the way from Florida? Bless your heart!<br> You know Armand Duvalle, dear.<br> Come on in, Armand.<br> Mr. Duvalle, this is my aunt, Miss Adams.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Barnsley,<br> Miss Heath and Mr. Randall.<br> We've had the most terrible time.<br> Armand's car broke down last night<br> miles from nowhere...<br> and we had to stay at the nastiest inn ever.<br> No modern conveniences. lt was dreadful!<br> We were coming home from the junior prom.<br> Armand's pupil invited us.<br> Oh, it's a long story, but l must....<br> Hello, there!<br> Your wife, she was the loveliest woman<br> in the party.<br> Armand, you always say the nicest things.<br> lsn't that cute? Did you bring him that?<br> -Yes--<br> -Go catch it!<br> -Were you disappointed l wasn't here?<br> -Not at all. After all, you didn't expect me.<br> And you'll forgive me<br> for my car's imperfect performance?<br> Of course.<br> l'm sorry the inn was so inconvenient.<br> That's the only thing that bothers me.<br> You know, your husband<br> is not like the average American man.<br> He's free of all mean suspicion.<br> He has more the Continental mind. Yes?<br> That's right, l have a Continental mind.<br> Will you have an eggnog?<br> Thank you.<br> l don't know what kind of a mind Jerry's got,<br> Continental or cockeyed...<br> but he's a wonder.<br> Now, if l stayed out all night...<br> and waltzed in with handsome Mr. Duvalle,<br> and said the car broke down....<br> lt did. Why should Jerry be angry?<br> l didn't build the car.<br> -You're perfectly right, dear.<br> -Of course l am.<br> Can't have a happy married life<br> if you're always suspicious.<br> Right again.<br> -A little nutmeg?<br> -Please.<br> -Why am l boring you with private matters?<br> -We're not bored.<br> No one's interested in my adventure<br> but Jerry, who knows it's innocent...<br> just as well as he knows<br> that he just got back from Florida.<br> l see what you mean.<br> More drinks, everybody? There's lots left.<br> -No, thank you, l think we better be going.<br> -You don't all have to go, do you?<br> Go? No.<br> -Well, it's silly to go so soon.<br> -We must go, really.<br> Patsy, dear, where are you going?<br> l haven't even had a chance to talk to you.<br> l'll see you later, my dear.<br> l always say four's a crowd.<br> There's something in what she says.<br> Thank you.<br> -Say, are you hungry?<br> -To tell you the truth, l'm starved.<br> Why don't you go out and grab a bite?<br> -A strong fellow should take care of himself.<br> -Why, what have l done?<br> -lf you speak of last night, l assure you--<br> -You don't believe--<br> We'll discuss it in private.<br> That is if Mr. Duvalle can remember<br> where we keep our door.<br> ln all fairness, you should permit me<br> to remain and explain ourselves.<br> American women<br> aren't accustomed to gallantry.<br> l appreciate your offer,<br> but maybe you'd better go.<br> Pardon me, Mrs. Warriner,<br> you misunderstand.<br> l am a voice teacher, am l not?<br> For one year she has been my pupil.<br> And from time to time, l pat her on the back.<br> l mean, l congratulate her on her...<br> -development.<br> -ls that so?<br> -Do l express myself?<br> -You've been doing all right.<br> But now my position must be considered.<br> l have never yet been in a scandal.<br> -Never been caught?<br> -No.<br> l am a great teacher, not a great lover.<br> That's right, Armand, no one could ever<br> accuse you of being a great lover.<br> That is, l mean to say,<br> who's to say whether you are or not?<br> lt's all so silly!<br> But maybe you had better go.<br> -l really don't know what to say.<br> -lf you go, you won't have to say anything.<br> -Perhaps it is best this way, Mrs. Warriner.<br> -l think so.<br> -l will see you soon?<br> -Yes.<br> lt has been all so perfect.<br> Thank you for everything.<br> Take another bow.<br> Not a bad performance<br> considering no rehearsals or anything.<br> Why, Mr. Warriner,<br> you're out of your Continental mind.<br> That was funny, what he said<br> about your Continental mind.<br> -No doubt he has a better sense of humor.<br> -No, l beg to differ.<br> Right now you're twice as funny as him.<br> -Quit stalling, Lucy.<br> -l'm not--<br> Perhaps our marriage means nothing to you.<br> Perhaps you have no sentiment left for me.<br> Look at this.<br> Look, a letter l wrote you.<br> Did you care when you read it? No!<br> You knew there'd be a letter<br> every morning...<br> but you were far too busy<br> with Armand Duvalle to give it a thought.<br> lt's enough to destroy one's faith, isn't it?<br> l haven't any faith left in anyone.<br> l know just how you feel.<br> What do you mean?<br> You didn't mention in any of your letters<br> the terrible rainy spell in Florida.<br> The papers were full of it.<br> -l can explain that, Lucy.<br> -You can?<br> Don't try to change the subject.<br> You think a great offense is a great defense.<br> Don't try to justify your behavior<br> by insinuating things about me.<br> l haven't any behavior to justify.<br> l've just been unlucky.<br> You caught me in a truth, and it seems<br> there's nothing less logical than the truth.<br> -A philosopher?<br> -You don't believe me.<br> How can l believe you?<br> ''The car broke down.''<br> People stopped believing that ages ago.<br> -His car's very old.<br> -So is his story.<br> -Let me tell you something.<br> -Let me tell you something.<br> l told you the truth about all this, Jerry.<br> Don't you see?<br> There can't be any doubt in marriage.<br> The whole thing's built on faith.<br> lf you've lost that, you've lost everything.<br> When that's gone<br> the marriage is washed up.<br> -Do you mean that?<br> -Yes.<br> -Then that settles it.<br> -l guess it does.<br> l wouldn't go on living with you<br> if you were dipped in platinum.<br> So divorce me. lt'll be a pleasure.<br> You think l'd drag that music lover to court<br> to show people the man you preferred?<br> Then l'll divorce you.<br> lt's customary for the wife to bring suit.<br> lt has something to do<br> with the husband being a gentleman.<br> Just get on with the divorce proceedings.<br> l can't wait.<br> -l'll call our lawyer right now.<br> -All right, here.<br> You don't mind? l don't know anyone else.<br> You get around much more than l do.<br> ls that so?<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Lucy.<br> What's that?<br> Divorce? You and Jerry?<br> Don't do anything in haste<br> you might regret later.<br> -Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--<br> -Can't she call back after we've eaten?<br> Please be quiet, will you?<br> You seem agitated, Lucy.<br> Try and calm yourself.<br> l'd hate to see you take any hasty action<br> in a matter like this.<br> -Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--<br> -Finish your meal.<br> -Why can't they call you back later?<br> -Will you shut your mouth?<br> As l was saying, Lucy,<br> marriage is a beautiful thing.<br> When you've been married as long as l,<br> you'll appreciate it, too.<br> Your food's getting ice-cold.<br> You always complain about your food.<br> Just shut your big mouth.<br> l'll eat when l'm good and ready.<br> lf you don't like it,<br> you know what you can do. So shut up!<br> Marriage is a beautiful thing.<br> You see? Because you were a naughty dog,<br> they made you leave the room. Come on.<br> ln the case of Warriner v. Warriner,<br> the court grants...<br> an interlocutory decree of divorce<br> in favor of the plaintiff, Lucy Warriner.<br> The divorce, without further contesting,<br> will become final 90 days from this day.<br> Plaintiff and defendant then have the liberty<br> to make other marriages, if they so desire.<br> Your Honor, there's a matter still unsettled.<br> -The matter about....<br> -Mr. Smith.<br> -Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Smith.<br> -Who is Mr. Smith?<br> -Mr. Smith is their dog.<br> -No, Mr. Smith is my dog.<br> -ls that so?<br> -Silence!<br> But, you see, Mr. Smith belongs to me,<br> and she has him.<br> Very well, go ahead.<br> The animal is in Mrs. Warriner's possession.<br> You ordered him from the courtroom<br> at the beginning, for contempt.<br> -Mr. Warriner wishes to have him because....<br> -Because he's mine!<br> -He is not.<br> -He is, too.<br> -He is not.<br> -Silence!<br> ls not.<br> Mrs. Warriner, step up and tell me<br> why you regard the dog...<br> as your personal property, so the court<br> may decide if he should remain with you.<br> Nothing would please me more.<br> Your Honor, l saw Mr. Smith first.<br> lt was in that pet shop on Madison Avenue.<br> You know it?<br> -You don't? lt's between 47th and....<br> -lt's frightfully immaterial.<br> Well, you ought to know.<br> l decided to buy Mr. Smith...<br> but l turned away for a moment<br> to look at a Persian kitten. Do you like cats?<br> l don't either. So l turned around again,<br> and this man had Mr. Smith in his arms.<br> l said, ''Pardon me, l'm buying this puppy.''<br> And then he just smiled at me.<br> Then somehow, suddenly,<br> the three of us were having lunch...<br> the man, and Mr. Smith, and l.<br> And then things happened swiftly...<br> so l said, ''We'd better get married,''<br> and we did.<br> That way we could give Mr. Smith<br> a better home and live happily ever after.<br> -Until now.<br> -l see.<br> ln these custody cases, Mrs. Warriner...<br> we often allow the final decision<br> to rest with the party in question.<br> You mean Mr. Smith?<br> Send for the dog.<br> Custody of the dog<br> will depend on his own desire.<br> -Mr. Warriner, will you step up here, please?<br> -Yes, Your Honor.<br> Unfasten him.<br> You may each call the dog.<br> -Mr. Smith, come on, boy.<br> -Smitty, look up here.<br> Don't pay attention.

Mr. Leeson thought that maybe<br> he'd like to buy your interest.<br> That is, if the price is right.<br> l was telling Mr. Leeson, l mean Daniel...<br> about how badly we were doing,<br> and he thought maybe he could do better.<br> l suppose you told him<br> there wasn't any coal in it, too.<br> Well, if you're interested,<br> you might bring around the data tomorrow.<br> l'm very lucky.<br> You know what they call me back home?<br> l can guess.<br> l just met her.<br> l guess it was easier for her<br> to change her name...<br> than for a whole family to change theirs.<br> That'd go great out West.<br> Seemed to go pretty well<br> with the cowboy here.<br> You want to change the subject?<br> Why don't you two get up and dance?<br> Or don't you dance?<br> Lucy doesn't care much about dancing.<br> Didn't you know that?<br> Did Lucy tell you that? She's holding out<br> on you. She's a beautiful dancer.<br> Why, l used to call her ''Twinkle Toes.''<br> Hello, Twinkle Toes.<br> Have you been fooling me, you little rascal?<br> Honestly, l didn't think<br> you cared much about it.<br> Care about it?<br> Why, l could dance till the cows come home.<br> l won several cups at it myself.<br> We never won any cups.<br> Maybe you had the wrong partner.<br> There's a lot in what you say.<br> -Can l have this waltz, Lucy?<br> -Of course.<br> Here, give this to the orchestra leader<br> and tell him...<br> -to play the same number again.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Come on, sing.<br> lt's ''all day.''<br> -l'm sorry.<br> -lt's all right.<br> -Not bad.<br> -Thanks.<br> -Never had a lesson in my life.<br> -You don't say.<br> -Have you?<br> -Well, yes.<br> Let's sing another one.<br> That must be him now.<br> -Hello, Warriner.<br> -Hello, Leeson.<br> -Hello, Lucy.<br> -Hello, Jerry.<br> -Glad you dropped up.<br> -Thanks.<br> l really am very interested<br> in that mine of yours.<br> Yes, l brought along all the records<br> and history of....<br> l've looked all over for McCall's report<br> on that mine.<br> -l can't find it anywhere. You must have it.<br> -Maybe l have.<br> Next chance you get,<br> look through your stocking drawer.<br> She always hides important things<br> in the top drawer of her dresser.<br> She does?<br> Every legal paper we had smelled of sachet.<br> lt did?<br> Even the marriage certificate.<br> Remember when the clerk asked to see it<br> and you couldn't find it?<br> We had a bunch of pals at the hotel.<br> They kept ribbing us all night.<br> Remember when they sent the bellboy?<br> We didn't want ice water.<br> No?<br> What's the matter?<br> When you two are married<br> the three of us can talk more freely.<br> About this mine business...<br> this place was formerly owned<br> by the Fullerton Brothers. They....<br> You've heard of the Fullerton Brothers,<br> haven't you?<br> Yes.<br> lt seems they didn't know much<br> about the mining situation in Pennsylvania.<br> -Their racket was mainly--<br> -Why, hello, Ma!<br> -Hello.<br> -Hello, Mrs. Leeson.<br> -Hello, Lucy.<br> -Ma, this is Mr. Jerry Warriner.<br> -Not--<br> -Yes, ma'am, that's right.<br> -We're discussing a business proposition.<br> -l see.<br> -lt's funny seeing you.<br> -lt is?<br> Well, it's funny seeing you.<br> What l mean is, l was at a tea this afternoon<br> where some people...<br> were speaking of you and of Lucy, too.<br> They knew you both before the divorce.<br> l'll bet you run into dozens of people<br> who knew us before the divorce.<br> Yes, we used to get around quite a lot.<br> Didn't we?<br> They spoke very well of you.<br> They said you were a real gentleman.<br> Oh, did they really?<br> And they were talking of Lucy, too.<br> You know, you do sing divinely, dear.<br> But l'd never realized till this afternoon<br> that you had a teacher...<br> and a very handsome one, l understand.<br> There was a woman there, if l hadn't been<br> a lady l would have slapped her face.<br> -Why didn't you?<br> -l wish l had, because she insinuated....<br> As a matter of fact,<br> she didn't even insinuate.<br> Well, she was talking<br> about your divorcing Mr. Warriner.<br> She came right out and said<br> that it should have been....<br> No matter, no matter.<br> -No matter.<br> -No matter.<br> Let's get down to business, Leeson.<br> lf l'd had time to work this mine myself,<br> l'd have made a fortune.<br> But l was always too busy<br> making money for other people.<br> There's a section up there<br> simply crying for someone to go in...<br> who has the time and money to give it.<br> l think if you could sink a shaft<br> in this north corner, right about here....<br> Wait, let me show you something.<br> l ought to tell you, Jerry,<br> nobody is listening to you.<br> The girl's name needs clearing, partner.<br> l wouldn't go so far as to say that.<br> But l'm sure Mr. Warriner<br> is pleased at the opportunity...<br> to deny that silly story<br> l heard this afternoon.<br> Why, certainly, Mrs. Leeson. What is it?<br> This woman said Mr. Warriner permitted you<br> to bring proceedings so that....<br> Well, so that your reputation<br> wouldn't be ruined.<br> There, it's out. l know it's silly but--<br> Of course it's silly, and so are you.<br> -What?<br> -See here, Warriner.<br> l mean it's silly for your mother<br> to believe such nonsense.<br> You see, our divorce was one of those<br> tragedies that you read about in the papers.<br> A trusting woman and a worthless man.<br> l was never good enough for Lucy<br> and finally she found it out.<br> l was never good enough for Lucy<br> and finally she found it out.<br> Lucy is above suspicion,<br> and always has been.<br> She's as pure as the driven snow,<br> as faithful as she is fair.<br> And l would that l had been worthy<br> to kiss the hem of her garment.<br> Never during our marital bliss<br> did she cause me a moment's uneasiness.<br> Never did l have to ask, ''Lucy, where<br> have you been, what were you doing?''<br> l always knew.<br> l tell you, something wonderful<br> went out of my life when l lost her.<br> -l know just how you feel.<br> -How do you know?<br> How can you know how it feels to have<br> used up the best years of a woman's life?<br> Of course, that's the way it goes.<br> Excuse me, you're sitting on my prospectus.<br> Dan, take those and look them over.<br> And let me know. And, Dan...<br> take good care of her.<br> l'll be going now.<br> Yes, Dan, take good care of her.<br> Maybe you'll succeed where l failed.<br> l'm sure that the three of you will be<br> very happy out where the West begins.<br> lf you ever think of me, send me a postcard.<br> Just say, ''Having a wonderful time.''<br> l'll understand.<br> Goodbye, now.<br> Ma, are you convinced about everything?<br> What about the music teacher?<br> You two try and settle things for yourselves.<br> Let me know how it comes out.<br> Put a light in the window if it's yes,<br> two if it's no.<br> And if you can't make up your minds,<br> just pull down the shade.<br> Hello.<br> What are you doing in my apartment,<br> if l'm not too inquisitive?<br> l thought after my swell reference<br> about you, l deserved a drink.<br> -Wish l'd mixed it for you.<br> -l see what you mean.<br> Certainly do appreciate<br> all the charming things you said about me.<br> When l get the chance,<br> l hope l can do as much for you.<br> lt was nothing at all.<br> l try to go through life--<br> l know,<br> spreading a little sunshine as you go.<br> No, frankly, l was worried about you.<br> You've never asked for money.<br> Do you need any?<br> No, l think l can struggle along<br> without any help from you.<br> l thought maybe you made<br> a bad investment.<br> -No. l only made one bad investment.<br> -Don't bite me.<br> l thought that maybe Buffalo Bill's millions<br> might have something to do--<br> Nothing to do with anything.<br> Millions or no millions,<br> he's a very charming person.<br> l've seen him.<br> l can't possibly interpret this as jealousy.<br> No.<br> l've come out from behind those clouds.<br> l've taken a definite turn for the better.<br> Nothing's going to hurt me anymore.<br> That's too bad, Jerry.<br> -Did it hurt you much?<br> -No.<br> -Just the one hand?<br> -Just the one hand.<br> l'll be going.<br> l always like to leave people laughing.<br> ls there anything l can get you for it?<br> No, l'm a stout fellow, l'll carry on.<br> -Where's Mr. Smith?<br> -Out with Aunt Patsy.<br> Tell me something before l go, will you?<br> -What do you see in this fellow?<br> -None of your business.<br> Not that l care, but what kind of a line<br> could he have that would impress you?<br> You might be surprised. You could take<br> a few lessons and profit nicely.<br> You'd be surprised what l'd give<br> to get an earful of that.<br> -You would.<br> -l couldn't wait to see you.<br> l had to tell you<br> how awful l feel about what happened.<br> You'll have to forgive Ma.<br> She's kind of old-fashioned.<br> -l'll forgive her.<br> -You won't hold it against her?<br> No. Now you go and dress for dinner.<br> We'll be very late.<br> l'm a lot quicker than you are.<br> Just to prove that you're not mad,<br> will you give me a little kiss?<br> -Right here in the hall? Don't be silly.<br> -There's nobody around.<br> -You never can tell if someone's around.<br> -l'll come in.<br> Don't come in. We'll be awfully late.<br> -Don't be bashful.<br> -l'm not bashful.<br> l've never kissed you before.<br> And l don't think this is exactly the place.<br> lf you knew how crazy l am about you,<br> you wouldn't hesitate. l can't sleep nights.<br> -Try drinking some hot milk.<br> -l must be in love...<br> -because l started writing poetry to you.<br> -Poetry.<br> l was going to surprise you with it at dinner,<br> but it's short. lt goes like this:<br> ''To you, my little prairie flower<br> l'm thinking of you every hour<br> ''Though now you're just a friend to me<br> l wonder what the end will be''<br> Excuse me, Dan,<br> l do laugh at the oddest times.<br> You see what l mean?<br> ''Oh, you would make my life divine<br> ''if you would change your name to mine''<br> That's really....<br> That's beautiful, Dan.<br> lt's really beautiful. There's my phone.<br> You've got to go now, really.<br> -Hello.<br> -Comment a va, madame?<br> -You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?<br> -Look, l have company.<br> All right, wait a minute, hold the phone.<br> There, now go on, Dan, l'll see you later.<br> Lucy, you've made me<br> the happiest man in the world.<br> Dreamed of this moment for days,<br> now it's all come true.<br> Dan, really!<br> l'll go home now and dress for dinner.<br> l'm so happy l could eat three steaks.<br> Hello?<br> Telephone.<br> Hello?<br> Can l expect you tomorrow?<br> At 3:00 tomorrow afternoon?<br> l think that would be convenient.<br> Very well then, 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.<br> Goodbye.<br> -Who was that?<br> -Why should it interest you?<br> Wait a minute, after all,<br> the final decree isn't in yet.<br> -lf you must know, it was my masseuse.<br> -My who?<br> l've heard everything. l'm going out<br> to get some popcorn and pink lemonade.<br> l've just seen a three-ring circus.<br> Armand Duvalle in?<br> -Please, your name?<br> -Jerry Warriner. ls my wife here?<br> l do not know.<br> What do you mean you don't know?<br> -l only know l don't know.<br> -You wouldn't mind if l look around.<br> Me, jujitsu.<br> -Me, jujitsu.<br> -ls that so?<br> Me, jujitsu, too.<br> You must not go in.<br> You must not disturb him.<br> l can't go in, he must not be disturbed.<br> You should have seen your master<br> this afternoon.<br> Come on, sit up, boy.<br> No, better still, l tell you...<br> go hide your eyes<br> and l'll give it to you that way.<br> Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five.<br> No peeking.<br> Five, ten, fifteen, twenty,<br> twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five. You ready?<br> All right, then, come on.<br> You're too smart.<br> Honestly, Patsy,<br> you should have seen Jerry this afternoon.<br> And when that chair<br> started to slip from under him.<br> -l will say that for Jerry, he's never dull.<br> -He was so silly, though.<br> l know he thought he'd find me<br> in Armand's arms.<br> He must have been terribly disappointed.<br> He must have felt awful<br> about not finding you two in a clinch.<br> Jerry's always had the most fantastic way<br> of getting into scrapes.<br> We've had some grand laughs together.<br> But a girl really wants<br> dependability and security.<br> Yes, l suppose she does.<br> Then she ought to buy an annuity.<br> Be more fun than Leeson.<br> Don't explain. l'm not marrying him.<br> That's what l wanted to tell you.<br> l'm not either.<br> l can't marry him because l'm still in love<br> with that crazy lunatic.<br> And there's nothing l can do about it.<br> Patsy, here and there, now and then...<br> -l've done a few things for you, haven't l?<br> -Yes.<br> Here's a note that l've written to Dan<br> explaining exactly why l can't marry him.<br> l could never phrase anything in person<br> as beautifully as l have in this note.<br> But now l've lost my nerve<br> about giving it to him.<br> -Could you sort of see that he gets it?<br> -l should say so.<br> Well, l tried to forget Jerry.<br> l know.<br> That's why you jumped at Leeson<br> as if he were the last man on earth.<br> l'll answer that.<br> Every time l open the door<br> somebody walks in.<br> -How do you do?<br> -How do you do?<br> -Hello, Armand.<br> -You sent for me, madam.<br> Yes, l've been so embarrassed<br> about what happened...<br> in front of your guests<br> l couldn't get out of there soon enough.<br> Your husband is a very funny man, isn't he?<br> l'm convinced he must care about me<br> or he wouldn't do those funny things.<br> Yes, but he doesn't care much about me.<br> No, Armand, that's just what l'm getting at.<br> -l'm wondering, could you do me a favor?<br> -But of course.<br> l've been thinking...<br> l wonder if you could convince him...<br> that everything was just as l said it was<br> that night at the inn.<br> l'd be glad to.<br> But does he carry a gun?<br> You're not afraid of him?<br> -Of course not, but--<br> -Will you do it for me?
