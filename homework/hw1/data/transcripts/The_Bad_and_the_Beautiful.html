                        Stage 5.<br> Mr. Amiel is rehearsing right now.<br> Very nice.<br> Honey, could you put your hand<br> up by your throat?<br> Telephone, Mr. Amiel.<br> Transatlantic, Paris. Jonathan Shields.<br> - Who?<br> - Jonathan Shields.<br> - Number one!<br> - Bring the boom back to one.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Amiel just left.<br> Hello? Yes.<br> Who? One moment, please.<br> Miss Georgia!<br> It's Paris, France. It's him!<br> I can't hear you.<br> It's Mr. Jonathan!<br> Jonathan Shields.<br> I still can't hear you.<br> Miss Lorrison is out.<br> No, I don't know.<br> No. I don't know where.<br> No, I don't know who...<br> ...nor where, nor what.<br> Out is out!<br> Hello.<br> What?<br> Talk a little louder, please.<br> It's a bad connection.<br> Yes, this is James Lee Bartlow.<br> Paris?<br> Mr. Shields?<br> Is Mr. Shields paying for this call?<br> Put him on.<br> Hello, Jonathan?<br> Drop dead.<br> - Hello, hello, hello.<br> - Harry, how are you?<br> - Georgia.<br> - Harry.<br> Since I became 60, more beautiful<br> women have kissed me than ever before.<br> You youngsters wouldn't know<br> anything about that.<br> Nice to see you.<br> That waistline is back down.<br> - Still keeping long hours.<br> - A little bit of midnight oil.<br> You can tell a successful author<br> by a cashmere jacket.<br> I'm trying to get a wardrobe like<br> yours. You're known for your style.<br> Georgia, darling. Come over<br> and sit down.<br> Freddie, take this chair.<br> - Congratulations on the Pulitzer Prize.<br> - Thanks, Harry.<br> - Your picture was great as usual, Fred.<br> - Thank you, Harry.<br> And you, my pretty one,<br> you really made me cry.<br> Have I flattered you enough?<br> Here's why I asked you here<br> in the middle of the night.<br> Why Jonathan called you today.<br> Jimmy told me you told him to drop dead.<br> Is that Pulitzer language?<br> James Lee never wrote a better line!<br> Well, here it is. After two years<br> Jonathan's ready to produce a picture.<br> He wants you to write it,<br> you to direct and you to star.<br> On the name Jonathan Shields,<br> it's impossible to raise five cents.<br> But on Fred Amiel, Georgia Lorrison,<br> James Lee Bartlow...<br> ...I can raise $2,000,000<br> by tomorrow noon.<br> I'm not going to beg you after<br> two years of begging for Jonathan.<br> That's enough. I know you'll never<br> work with him again.<br> But he doesn't get that.<br> Please. A favor to me, not to him.<br> Will you give me your answer<br> while I get him on the phone?<br> Good.<br> Get me the transatlantic operator.<br> We're ready to talk<br> with Jonathan Shields in Paris.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> You won't work with him.<br> I don't blame you.<br> Why should you? You've done enough<br> for him already... and vice versa.<br> Fred, you knew him first. You must<br> have known him for 15 or 16...<br> That guy standing next to me.<br> How should I know who he was?<br> We are met, my friends,<br> on a solemn occasion.<br> This man, Hugo Shields...<br> ...whose memory<br> we all cherish in our hearts...<br> ...whose loss we mourn so deeply.<br> Hugo Shields, one of the pioneers...<br> ...who built our great<br> motion-picture industry.<br> A madman who almost wrecked it.<br> A man of vision. An artist,<br> who created in the new medium...<br> A butcher who sold all<br> but the pig's whistle.<br> Hugo Shields brought<br> entertainment to millions.<br> He will never be forgotten.<br> Stay in line and take it easy.<br> You'll get your dough.<br> Thank you, Mr. Shields.<br> You're Shields?<br> You were hired to perform.<br> $11 to act like a mourner.<br> You didn't do your job,<br> you don't get paid. Next.<br> Next!<br> That afternoon I drove into<br> the Hollywood Hills. I just had to.<br> - It's me, Big Mouth.<br> - Come for a fight or your 11 bucks?<br> The things I said at the funeral<br> were childish and cheap. I'm sorry.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - What is it?<br> You in the business?<br> What do you do?<br> Bit of everything: Assistant director<br> on Poverty Row, four-day quickies...<br> ...sold a couple of story ideas. To eat<br> I work as an extra and do stunts.<br> - What I aim to be is a director.<br> - What's stopping you?<br> I can direct better than most<br> of the hacks I work for.<br> When it comes to telling people<br> how good I am, I get tongue-tied.<br> I'm not that tongue-tied with you.<br> - You are looking for a job?<br> - Yeah.<br> So am I.<br> Come on in.<br> If my father had died last year,<br> I'd be a millionaire.<br> Next year, he'd have put up<br> a new studio for me to inherit.<br> This year, I don't have a dime.<br> - Who paid the crowd at the funeral?<br> - That was the last of the cash.<br> He lived in a crowd.<br> I couldn't let him be buried alone.<br> The best legal counsel advised me<br> to change my name.<br> Because the town thought<br> your father was a heel?<br> He wasn't a heel.<br> He was the heel.<br> We couldn't stand living in the<br> same town, but I liked him a lot.<br> He made great pictures. So will I.<br> You haven't got much to begin with.<br> No, he brought me up to start at the<br> top. How do you start at the bottom?<br> - Are you gonna change your name?<br> - Change it?<br> I'm gonna ram the name of Shields<br> down their throats.<br> Where are you living?<br> Until they kick me out,<br> this is my bed and board.<br> Come on.<br> By the way, my name is Fred Amiel.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> but jobs were sky-high.<br> Particularly if your name was Shields.<br> Some days we'd hit with a quickie<br> or a Western on Poverty Row...<br> ... and eat well.<br> Okay, boys. Let's go.<br> Grab that one.<br> And some nights we played.<br> We crashed only the very best parties.<br> If the actor counts five between<br> each word, you think he's good.<br> And directing? If you don't film it,<br> get it in the cutting room.<br> Man's in love, cut to a cactus.<br> She goes crazy, fade into a wheel.<br> Montage, montage!<br> But where is your story?<br> All right, so I won't argue with you.<br> I'm taking off my agent hat<br> and putting on my friendship hat.<br> This boy can be the biggest ever,<br> your next Victor Ribera.<br> He's got everything: Heart, brains<br> and he's beautiful to look at.<br> I don't care what she writes about me.<br> It's what she wrote about Arturo.<br> He hit me and hurt me.<br> I'm not always yelling about<br> a star's right to a private life.<br> Fans are entitled to see us<br> in the flesh sometimes.<br> Only last week I was in New York...<br> I've got a full house,<br> and you can't have four of a kind. No.<br> Not even in one of your B pictures!<br> - Harry, I think you're bluffing.<br> - Put up or shut up.<br> Money talks, and I've got money.<br> I raise you 500.<br> - Right back at you.<br> - Five, and five more.<br> - Call.<br> - Four fours.<br> When did you begin to tell the truth?<br> Don't tell me "today." What time today?<br> - Harry Pebbel's a great poker player.<br> - Yeah.<br> But my father could always beat him,<br> and I could always beat my father.<br> - To get in a game like that, I need...<br> - You're crazy!<br> All I need is a few hundred dollars<br> for my first stack of chips.<br> What's a few hundred dollars when<br> four citizens pool their resources?<br> Came the dawn...<br> - Good night, gentlemen.<br> - Good night.<br> - Jonathan!<br> - How much did you win?<br> - Five hundred?<br> - A thousand?<br> - More than that. Six thousand.<br> - Jonathan!<br> I lost.<br> To be exact, I lost $6,351.<br> - Who won?<br> - Harry Pebbel.<br> Harry, I admit it.<br> I lost the money and I owe you.<br> - I wish I could pay.<br> - It's breaking your heart.<br> - I could give you an IOU.<br> - What would I do with it?<br> You don't run this studio,<br> but you're an executive producer.<br> - B pictures...<br> - They make money.<br> You have four producers, why not five?<br> At $300 a week I could pay you off,<br> slowly, but surely.<br> $6,351.<br> - All right, you got the job.<br> - I thought so.<br> So you're a genius boy.<br> You think you blackmailed me!<br> Harry, that's a horrid word.<br> Well, get this.<br> My unit turns out 18 pictures a year.<br> I cry for ideas. If you'd sweat out a<br> story the way you do $6,351...<br> ...I'd have hired you anyway.<br> Why didn't you come to me? Too proud?<br> I tried to. I couldn't get in.<br> - You know who gave me my first job?<br> - My father.<br> - You angle things the cute way.<br> - I'll pay you $100 a week.<br> I wouldn't take a dime. Just bring me<br> a picture I can shoot, Genius Boy.<br> - One day you'll work for me.<br> - Get me Joe Clareton in publicity.<br> Meanwhile, I need an office<br> with a desk for my assistant.<br> Shields. Amiel.<br> - That's a big dream, Jonathan.<br> - If you dream, dream big.<br> Meanwhile, you'll be drawing<br> a modest check each Thursday.<br> It's time you two made it legal.<br> - Tell him he's crazy, IKKay.<br> - You're crazy.<br> - Tell him I'm not.<br> - He's not.<br> I just happen to have a ring with me.<br> Syd Murphy knows a friend<br> who knows a jeweler.<br> - Shall we?<br> - Tell him yes, IKKay.<br> He said to tell me yes.<br> She says yes very nicely.<br> The next few years, Shields produced<br> I directed the third<br> and five more after that.<br> We weren't really picturemakers,<br> we were second-hand dealers.<br> But we learnt our trade.<br> Then, one cloudy day, Harry Pebbel<br> assigned us a horror...<br> ... called The Doom of the Cat Men.<br> This the sort of thing you had in mind?<br> They need freshening up, though.<br> - I can't get into this.<br> - Don't worry.<br> If they don't turn around too much,<br> some muslin will hide it.<br> This needs fitting. Our department<br> will take care of that.<br> This may be a problem<br> unless you get a thinner man.<br> This material is imported.<br> We can't get it anymore.<br> But don't let that be an obstacle.<br> Here, the perfect fit.<br> This will give the full effect.<br> Lots of character and detail.<br> Plenty of fright. Needs puffing, but it'll do.<br> You gotta visualize it in the lights,<br> use imagination.<br> Shoulder pads will straighten it out.<br> This will give you the effect.<br> It'll be good.<br> - What if...?<br> - Suppose we...<br> - Five men dressed like cats look like...<br> - Five men dressed like cats.<br> When an audience pays to see this,<br> what do they pay for?<br> - To get the pants scared off them?<br> - What scares us more than anything?<br> - The dark!<br> - Of course, and why?<br> The dark has a life of its own,<br> and all sorts of things come alive.<br> - Suppose we never show the cat men.<br> - Exactly.<br> No cat men.<br> What do we put on the screen that'll<br> make the backs of their necks crawl?<br> Two eyes shining in the dark.<br> A dog: Frightened, growling,<br> showing its fangs.<br> A bird: Its neck broken,<br> feathers torn from its throat.<br> A little girl: Screaming,<br> claw marks down her cheeks.<br> Cut!<br> Okay, boys, new deal. Wrap it up!<br> This is my first star!<br> The night of the sneak preview,<br> Harry Pebbel still hadn't seen it.<br> Jonathan and I<br> had made sure of that.<br> Go, go, go!<br> - Hurry, hurry.<br> - Now, sir.<br> "It stinks": 1. "Fair": 8.<br> "Good": 24. "Very good": 47.<br> We've never had cards like this.<br> - Give us more like this one.<br> - "Excellent": 34. "Outstanding": 17.<br> I'll put these in the executive dining room.<br> That'll show 'em.<br> - What Harry Pebbel can do...<br> - Be at my office at 10:00 a.m.<br> I'll give you your next assignment.<br> You did all right.<br> I did a great job at producing.<br> Tell that to the executives.<br> And remember that "Shields"<br> is not spelled P-E-B-B-E-L.<br> I don't wanna give you too much credit.<br> Just enough to keep you hungry.<br> By the way, my name<br> is spelled A-M-I-E-L.<br> I thought of taking a small bow myself.<br> A small bow never helped anybody.<br> Get this straight, Fred.<br> We're building Shields Productions.<br> What we'll ram it down their throats.<br> - It's big enough for both of us.<br> - I know.<br> A five-cent story, a ten-cent budget<br> and a two-cent leading man...<br> ...and we put it over.<br> We're getting to know our business.<br> - Yes, Mother.<br> - Let's go back and get my car.<br> When I work on a picture,<br> it's like romancing a girl.<br> You see her, you want her,<br> you go after her. The big moment.<br> Then, the letdown. Every time.<br> The after-picture blues.<br> Don't worry. Someday you'll learn<br> to love 'em and leave 'em.<br> - Why are you turning off here?<br> - This you got to see.<br> Crow's Nest.<br> George Lorrison built this.<br> This is where he died.<br> I wouldn't have missed it for anything.<br> Can we go home now?<br> So this is how actors used to live.<br> Cheerful little place, isn't it?<br> Now, if we can just find out<br> where he keeps the boiling oil...<br> The rumpus room.<br> Jonathan, will you please tell me<br> what we're doing here?<br> You scouting a location?<br> Sure, that's it.<br> For our next Harry Pebbel production.<br> It could be<br> The Bat Men Fly Again...<br> ...or Mama Vampire<br> and the Three Little Bloodsuckers.<br> - We don't even have to show...<br> - Hold this.<br> Lorrison's idea of my old man.<br> Lorrison's last three pictures<br> were for my father.<br> He gave me my first drink<br> when I was 13.<br> My first cigar at 14.<br> And when I was 15...<br> ...he taught me the facts of life.<br> He was a great actor...<br> ...and a great man.<br> - He was a rat and a drunk.<br> - Who are you?<br> - His daughter.<br> - I didn't know he had one.<br> - Neither did he half the time.<br> - What are you doing up there?<br> - Get out.<br> "A rat and a drunk."<br> What talk about your father!<br> He was my father.<br> Now, shut up and leave me alone?<br> - Go on, blow.<br> - Somebody ought to tan your rear!<br> Wanna try it?<br> I changed my mind.<br> Now, will you get out of here?<br> Go on, get out!<br> The next morning, Jonathan<br> received our next assignment.<br> Did you see Harry?<br> Well, what's our next picture?<br> Get a good grip on yourself.<br> You ready?<br> Our next picture will be<br> The Son of the Cat Men.<br> That settles it.<br> The time has come.<br> The Faraway Mountain.<br> It's a great book.<br> Three studios tried to lick it and couldn't.<br> Well, I can!<br> Here's my outline, scene for scene.<br> - You know what Harry will say.<br> - Yeah.<br> "Look, I've told you<br> a hundred times, Genius Boy...<br> ...I want pictures that end with<br> a kiss and ink on the books."<br> Jonathan, this is my baby.<br> I found it and I licked it.<br> I've been nursing it till I was sure<br> we could handle it. Now I'm sure.<br> Remember what you said last night?<br> Enough practice.<br> It's time we made one for real.<br> It cries for a million dollar budget<br> and location in Veracruz...<br> ...but you producing and me directing,<br> we can do it on a Harry Pebbel budget.<br> - For a guy who's tongue-tied...<br> - I could always talk to you.<br> You really wanna do this one, Fred.<br> I wanna direct it so much<br> I can taste it.<br> All right, let's do it.<br> Let's do it!<br> I've said 100 times<br> I don't wanna win awards.<br> Give me pictures that end with a kiss<br> and ink on the books.<br> I make this picture, or I quit.<br> This is my baby.<br> I found it, and I licked it.<br> I wanna produce it so much I can taste it!<br> I'm handing it to you,<br> father of The Son of the Cat Men.<br> Do I produce The Faraway Mountain<br> or don't I?<br> All right, Genius Boy.<br> You've got it coming to you.<br> Make it and hang yourself.<br> Why don't you fire me<br> and get it over with?<br> I know the talk around the studio.<br> They say I need you, that you do<br> the work and I get the credit.<br> You think I don't know anything.<br> Well, I know one thing:<br> Every studio in town turned<br> this stinker down. Go ahead, make it.<br> It'll lay such a bomb you'll never get<br> another job in this industry.<br> Will I let you produce it?<br> You're on suspension if you don't!<br> I thought my Faraway Mountain<br> outline was perfect.<br> After three weeks with Jonathan,<br> it was twice as good.<br> We worked day and night.<br> Kay kept the coffee hot and handy.<br> As Jonathan shaped our material,<br> I saw what Hollywood...<br> ... later came to call<br> the "Shields touch," Jonathan's magic.<br> Our toughest problem<br> was a leading man.<br> On a Harry Pebbel budget,<br> a top star was out of the question.<br> So, I directed tests, a dozen tests.<br> Action.<br> So you are Theresa.<br> I find you as your brother told me,<br> alone in the great house...<br> ... silent, proud and beautiful.<br> What is it?<br> Are you afraid of me?<br> Switch over to the next one.<br> Action.<br> So you are Theresa. I find you<br> as your brother told me I would...<br> ... alone in the great house,<br> proud, silent and beautiful.<br> - Who's the girl?<br> - Douvane said she could test with him.<br> What did she promise?<br> Who is she?<br> George Lorrison's daughter.<br> Why didn't you shoot her face?<br> She was drunk.<br> This is murder, Syd.<br> Let's have that list again.<br> You're the director, pick your poison.<br> Jonathan.<br> - What about Victor Ribera?<br> - Gaucho?<br> - Why not?<br> - Sure you'd like him. Who wouldn't?<br> - Why can't we get Gaucho?<br> - The whole town's after Latin lovers.<br> - You wouldn't stand a chance.<br> - How do we know till we've tried?<br> Maybe you could talk him<br> into it, Jonathan.<br> Syd, what would appeal<br> to a guy like that?<br> Gaucho? Well, if I know Gaucho...<br> I'll drive.<br> Jonathan forgot one thing.<br> He forgot he couldn't drink.<br> Nice boy. But does he always<br> take on so much altitude?<br> He's been working<br> night and day for three weeks.<br> Besides which, he hardly ever drinks.<br> - He wants me to make a picture?<br> - Yeah.<br> Why does he go to all this<br> lovely trouble? I'm a very simple man.<br> I read. What I like, I act.<br> What I do not like...<br> ...I do not act. Very simple.<br> A conference was held<br> in Pebbel's office...<br> ... to discuss production plans<br> for The Faraway Mountain.<br> The suspense was killing me.<br> - Yes, Mr. Pebbel?<br> - You can go to lunch now.<br> - Why don't you take a look in there?<br> - I think I'll stay here and be nervous.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Thanks.<br> Jonathan...<br> - Didn't he go for Gaucho?<br> - Go for him? He had a hemorrhage!<br> First time a star said he'd be<br> in a Pebbel picture.<br> Harry went to bat for us. He slugged<br> it out with the front office!<br> The Faraway Mountain will be made<br> with a million-dollar budget.<br> Location in Veracruz.<br> Von Ellstein to direct.<br> Gaucho. Wendy for the girl.<br> Chapman my cameraman...<br> - Von Ellstein to direct...<br> - You're taken care of.<br> No separate panel, but your name on<br> the screen: Assistant to the producer.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You know the story. It's your baby.<br> I want you on the set. You have<br> any ideas, I'll tell Von Ellstein.<br> Thanks, again.<br> Von Ellstein to direct...<br> - You said he was the best.<br> - Sure he is.<br> Fred, I'd rather hurt you now<br> than kill you off forever.<br> You're not ready<br> to direct a million dollar picture.<br> But you're ready to produce one.<br> With Von Ellstein, I am.<br> You're stealing my picture!<br> It was my idea!<br> Without me it was only an idea.<br> All right, Jonathan.<br> Let's put it this way.<br> You gave me your word.<br> So I did.<br> I got the starting date.<br> In two weeks you leave for Veracruz.<br> Mr. Von Ellstein,<br> you'll go one week earlier.<br> Mr. Shields, I don't like producers...<br> ...but for a man with such a script...<br> ...it'll be a pleasure to break my rule.<br> Today, I shall buy a producer lunch.<br> - Am I included?<br> - By all means, no.<br> Today I've seen a script prepared by<br> a producer who thinks like a director.<br> - 13 years I've been making pictures...<br> - Goodbye, Jonathan.<br> Fred...<br> So long, Fred.<br> This is the first time I've found a<br> script I can direct exactly as it is...<br> I always said the boy was a genius.<br> Are you looking at the Oscar he got<br> for The Faraway Mountain?<br> I know what you have<br> against Jonathan, and no wonder.<br> Look what he did to you, Fred.<br> He brushed you off his coattail,<br> so you had to stand alone.<br> And all you've got in the world is<br> a wife, six kids, two Academy Awards...<br> ...and every studio in town after you.<br> Why, Jonathan ruined you!<br> Look what he did to me.<br> I gave him his chance to do<br> The Faraway Mountain.<br> Four months later, his contract's up,<br> and he walks out of the studio.<br> And I go right with him.<br> I know how you feel about him, Georgia.<br> After all, you're a woman<br> and an actress.<br> The first time I saw Jonathan,<br> I was not a woman or an actress.<br> The next time I saw him,<br> five years later...<br> ... I wasn't an actress.<br> I was a nothing.<br> We'll sign you up outside. 9:00 people,<br> we'll need you in the background.<br> Following people, on your way out<br> please report to wardrobe.<br> - Mr. Amiel?<br> - What is it, Georgia?<br> I'd like to sign out early if I could.<br> They're casting a bit at Shields.<br> If I could get there by 3...<br> - Go ahead. Good luck.<br> - Thanks, Mr. Amiel.<br> Gus drove me over.<br> He waited while I changed.<br> There were few agents in town<br> with fewer clients than Gus.<br> He was the kind of agent<br> who handled only bit players...<br> ... and who never could get into<br> a major producer's office.<br> Gus is still my agent.<br> Girls, will you come in, please?<br> Line up right across here.<br> You stand here, you over here.<br> Honey, will you come down here?<br> Thank you.<br> They're for the drugstore bit.<br> - How about the newborn baby?<br> - Four here at 3:45.<br> Girls. Mr. Shields,<br> Mr. Pebbel, Mr. McDill.<br> How do you do?<br> You're the director.<br> Is the girl on the end all right?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> - You're it.<br> - Thank you. Girls, come with me.<br> My call came two days later.<br> By then, I'd memorized my one line.<br> I'll wait.<br> Read any good books lately?<br> - Cut.<br> - How was it?<br> - Was that all right with you?<br> - Take it again?<br> - Once again, boys! Here we go!<br> - How's the makeup?<br> Try it again.<br> All right, roll.<br> - Speed.<br> - Action.<br> I'll wait.<br> Read any good books lately?<br> - Cut!<br> - How was it?<br> Print that. Let's have a test.<br> - Move in for a close-up.<br> - New deal, boys.<br> Your door was unlocked.<br> For a one-day bit,<br> you sure expect a lot of company.<br> For that kind of company,<br> I don't have to trot here at 4:00 a.m.<br> - All I have to do is pick up a phone.<br> - Well, pick one up!<br> You were under contract to Al Cope.<br> - Can you hear me?<br> - Yes.<br> - You were under contract, right?<br> - Three years ago, for six months.<br> Until they found<br> they had another cluck.<br> Did you ever play<br> a real part in a picture?<br> Last year I played lead<br> in a little epic called Jungle Tigress.<br> I ran it. You played straight man<br> to a chimpanzee. I've tried to find...<br> I've been trying to find<br> one decent foot of film on you.<br> - Is there any?<br> - Yes.<br> That one line I did yesterday.<br> That was good.<br> But it's not enough to go by.<br> I want you to make a test for me.<br> All right, Mr. Shields.<br> Isn't this scene supposed<br> to go something like this?<br> I'll make a test for you, and you'll<br> be good to me, and I'll be good to you.<br> Who's kidding who?<br> It's 4 in the morning.<br> The test, I don't want it.<br> I wouldn't be any good anyway.<br> Just a waste of good film.<br> But you're a nice-Iooking guy,<br> and you did go to a lot of trouble.<br> And it's getting late,<br> so shall I turn out the light?<br> You're very generous.<br> Too generous.<br> You're a Lorrison, all right.<br> The Queen, my lord, is dead.<br> She should have died hereafter. There<br> would have been a time for such a word.<br> Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...<br> ... creeps in this petty pace<br> from day to day...<br> ... to the last syllable of recorded time.<br> And all our yesterdays have lighted<br> fools the way to dusty death.<br> Out, out, brief candle.<br> Life's but a walking shadow...<br> ... a poor player that struts and frets<br> his hour upon the stage...<br> Turn that off and get out!<br> I wanna get some sleep.<br> It is a tale told by an idiot.<br> Full of sound and fury,<br> signifying nothing.<br> Turn it off! I don't wanna hear it!<br> I hate him!<br> Make up your mind. You hate him,<br> and you build this shrine.<br> He died 10 years ago, and you've<br> been holding a wake since.<br> You can't be a star in a cemetery.<br> Stop pitching! I'm one girl<br> who doesn't wanna be a star.<br> Because he was a drunk, you are!<br> He loved girls, so you're a tramp!<br> You forget one thing.<br> He did it with style.<br> And you...<br> - Put that down.<br> - Suicide, how many times?<br> Twice. Put that pipe down!<br> Too sacred to touch?<br> Don't waste any sleep over me,<br> Mr. Shields.<br> The last time I tried to commit suicide<br> was six months ago.<br> - There won't be any next time.<br> - Won't there?<br> No.<br> People who knew my father<br> give me extra work now and then.<br> I drink what I want and see who I want.<br> Who knows?<br> Someday I may even get married...<br> ...to a nice upright assistant assistant.<br> And make him miserable<br> for the rest of his life...<br> ...because you're a Lorrison:<br> Haunted, living by make-believe.<br> You're acting now, playing the doomed<br> daughter of the great man.<br> The acting isn't good enough.<br> The cheap performance<br> of a bit player, not a star.<br> That's all, until you pull<br> yourself from this tomb!<br> Until you can see people as they are,<br> yourself as you are!<br> Until you can do this<br> to your father's picture...<br> ...and laugh as he would have!<br> That's not a god talking, Georgia,<br> that's only a man!<br> You!<br> Miss Lorrison! Miss Lorrison!<br> You better tell her it's all right.<br> It's all right, Mrs. Curry.<br> Good night, Georgia.<br> Good night.<br> It takes two hours<br> to get ready for a screen test.<br> Two very-early-in-the-morning hours.<br> Hello, honey. Here you are.<br> - Let's run the scene again.<br> - Thanks, Gus.<br> "I think you understand."<br> You mean you're through with me.<br> This is the end.<br> - "To put it that bluntly..."<br> - It means that little to you?<br> "Look, my dear.<br> We are two civilized people.<br> Let us act like civilized people."<br> They told me about you.<br> I didn't believe them. You hear...<br> - "But you're everything..."<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> But you're everything they said.<br> You hear evil.<br> You see evil. You speak evil.<br> You are evil.<br> - Fine. Let's run it again.<br> - Okay.<br> ... to put it bluntly.<br> It means that little to you?<br> Look, my dear.<br> We're two civilized people.<br> Let us act like civilized people.<br> They told me about you.<br> I didn't believe them.<br> But you're everything they said.<br> You hear evil. You see evil.<br> You speak evil.<br> You are evil!<br> What do you think?<br> Dear Jonathan, since you've paid me<br> $100,000 to direct this picture...<br> ...a lot of pound sterling...<br> ...presumably<br> you want my kind of picture.<br> With this girl, I tell you,<br> it won't be my kind of picture.<br> - She's impossible.<br> - Quite.<br> She's wooden, gauche, artificial.<br> - Completely out of the question.<br> - Quite.<br> Syd?<br> Jonathan, since you hire me<br> partly to yes you...<br> - You're fired.<br> - She stinks.<br> - You're hired. Harry?<br> - I know we can get her for nothing.<br> For nothing you get nothing.<br> She's nothing.<br> There were few agents in town<br> with fewer clients than Gus...<br> ... but the few he had he knew well.<br> I told you not to waste your film.<br> Gus, check with Harry Pebbel.<br> He's drawing up the contracts.<br> - She's in it?<br> - Of course.<br> You mean you're gonna give her a part?<br> The part.<br> Georgia!<br> Mr. Shields,<br> you're a very stubborn man.<br> Very, when I'm right.<br> I know I'm right about you.<br> I gave you no help. The test was<br> atrocious, but it proved one thing.<br> When you're on the screen,<br> the audience is looking at you.<br> That's star quality...<br> ...Lorrison quality.<br> Careful, Mr. Shields. You're looking<br> at me, but you see my father.<br> He gave me his name, but that's all.<br> Don't make a mistake.<br> Georgia...<br> ...no more doomed daughter, no more<br> whimpering, no more drinking...<br> - And no more men?<br> - By and by.<br> Gus, pull yourself together!<br> I can't help it, Mr. Shields.<br> I'm a very emotional man.<br> The picture was to start in six weeks.<br> And six weeks seemed like forever.<br> Then, suddenly, with fittings,<br> hairdressing and makeup tests...<br> ... five of them were gone.<br> I don't know what to do. The waist<br> has to be tight. The train, long...<br> Evelyn, will you tell me<br> what's worrying you?<br> Would you walk over there, please?<br> Now, turn.<br> Mr. Shields, I'm afraid Miss Lorrison<br> can't carry a dress like this.<br> It takes an enormous amount of poise.<br> You have to walk like a grand duchess<br> or hold yourself like Lilly Langtree.<br> Miss Lorrison will hold herself<br> like Miss Lorrison.<br> Miss Lorrison happens to be<br> an actress.<br> Make a wider turn, Georgia.<br> That's it.<br> Now, come over here.<br> You're all right.<br> Come here.<br> Sit down. Can you sit down?<br> - No.<br> - Perfect.<br> Everybody out now, please.<br> I wanna talk to my star.<br> - One week to go. Nervous?<br> - A little.<br> - Tired?<br> - Very.<br> You work very hard,<br> you're a good girl.<br> How good?<br> I'm sending you away.<br> Palm Springs for the rest of the week.<br> - Must I?<br> - Absolutely.<br> Till you're on set next week,<br> I want you to sleep...<br> ...relax, and not think about a thing.<br> Not even you?<br> - You said no drinking.<br> - One drink.<br> To Georgia, my star.<br> - You said no men.<br> - So I did.<br> - We'd agreed.<br> - You agreed all by yourself.<br> - Don't put words in my mouth.<br> - Well, they sure come flapping out.<br> My pavilion for the garden party,<br> it was to be three feet off the ground.<br> That three feet will cost,<br> with charges and extra shooting time...<br> ...$25,000, more or less,<br> and with you, more.<br> I can't shoot without it.<br> I won't shoot without it.<br> I'm building an entire sequence<br> to that one moment.<br> - So move the camera up!<br> - I will not cheat the shot!<br> - That's not the way I function.<br> - I'm not asking you to change...<br> Jonathan!<br> I have something to show you.<br> This is wonderful.<br> You can't say that.<br> I have to look after the budget.<br> Look. My new car.<br> I don't care where you put the camera.<br> Put your camera there.<br> - A boom costs 150 dollars a day.<br> - We talked about that 3 weeks ago.<br> - Like to drive it around the block?<br> - I'm busy.<br> - As smooth a drive you'll never have.<br> - Gaucho, I'm busy.<br> - How long would a quick ride take?<br> - Gaucho, I'm busy.<br> You're always busy!<br> Why don't you live a little? Adis.<br> - 25,000, I wanna tell you this...<br> - No, it's 7-8000.<br> 7-8000. I'm the one who's got to...<br> - I can't be shooting up their noses!<br> - Nobody's asking you to shoot up...<br> Gentlemen, there seems to be<br> an honest difference of opinion.<br> - We'll have to make a compromise.<br> - You bet.<br> The compromise, gentlemen, is this.<br> Harry, shut your penny-pinching<br> mouth and build him his platform!<br> The night before we started shooting,<br> I came back from Palm Springs.<br> I tried to sleep. I couldn't.<br> I don't know what drew me<br> to the empty stage.<br> I guess I was scared.<br> "To my new star, who will make me<br> very proud of her. Jonathan. "<br> It was cold on the set.<br> And suddenly, my throat was dry.<br> So dry I knew I had to have a drink.<br> The papers know,<br> but I asked them to lay off.<br> She'll burn up every column<br> in the country.<br> I wanted to do a picture with her, make<br> a star of someone this town discarded.<br> Cross her off. Let me contact<br> the agents and see who's available.<br> All right. Cast it and get it over with.<br> I'll tell Whitfield to shoot around the part.<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> - Get out a release.<br> We're signing Anne Gavery<br> for the part tomorrow morning.<br> - The morgue gives me the jitters.<br> - Forget her.<br> I've covered everything:<br> Waterfront, jails, hospitals...<br> ...scraped the Main Street booze parlors.<br> - I told you to forget her.<br> - I have professional pride.<br> I thought I knew every rathole in town.<br> She's found a new one, or she's left.<br> Janitor says she sometimes locks<br> her door and leaves for days at a time.<br> Where would I go for days at a time?<br> I try to put myself in her place...<br> Hello, Georgia.<br> You forgot...<br> ...you forgot to tie your tie.<br> You're sorry, aren't you?<br> Should I wash your mouth with soap<br> and send you to bed without supper?<br> Why did you do it, Georgia?<br> Do you know why?<br> Why?<br> Because I was afraid<br> I'd louse things up for you...<br> ...because I love you.<br> I do, you know.<br> It's cold sitting on the ground.<br> Georgia, come here.<br> Sit down.<br> Georgia, love is for the very young.<br> "For the very young." I like that.<br> Would you marry me, Jonathan?<br> Not even a little bit.<br> - That's too bad.<br> - Why?<br> Because I'd make you a good wife.<br> Well, right now I don't need a wife,<br> I need a star.<br> It's cold not sitting on the ground.<br> Let's go in by the fire, shall we?<br> We're signing Anne Gavery for the part.<br> - Oh? She'll be good.<br> - I think she will.<br> Why, that big ham, she couldn't...<br> Well, she...<br> Here.<br> Jonathan, if we were married,<br> I wouldn't take up much room.<br> Put those things on.<br> Your clothes will be dry soon.<br> - Hello.<br> - I've been trying to reach you.<br> - Oh, Harry...<br> - You have a picture in production.<br> - I know.<br> - We have to get a new star.<br> - Harry...<br> - Listen to me, and don't interrupt.<br> Jonathan, are you there?<br> - Hello. Hello.<br> - Harry, forget about Anne Gavery.<br> Have you gone crazy?<br> Are you drunk?<br> I said forget about her.<br> Georgia is right here.<br> Everything's fine. We'll use her.<br> I don't know what you've got<br> in your mind.<br> - You'll make a fool of yourself.<br> - I'll take that chance.<br> We'll see. I know.<br> Harry, listen to me...<br> Harry, shut up, and listen to me!<br> These are my instructions:<br> Georgia's in. We'll shoot in the morning.<br> - You call Whitfield and tell him.<br> - If I go to the bank, they'll laugh.<br> Everybody knows about this girl.<br> No studio will touch her...<br> Harry, shut up and listen to me.<br> Don't worry.<br> Everything's gonna be all right.<br> - I know just how to handle her now.<br> - You know how to handle her!<br> They're...<br> They're blue.<br> Blue is my, my lucky...<br> ...color.<br> We were 14 weeks<br> shooting the picture.<br> The most wonderful 14 weeks<br> I'd ever known.<br> Change that line right there.<br> ...see him. Up!<br> They'll throw pennies at us.<br> It's ridiculous.<br> This is a dramatic moment.<br> The guy you love is onstage.<br> You see him, and you know<br> somebody's gonna kill him.<br> If you're gonna joke about...<br> You're not taking this seriously.<br> I'll try once more, and that's all.<br> This mumbo jumbo<br> doesn't make any sense.<br> Try again. Make love<br> while you're lighting the cigarette.<br> Go ahead. Take it.<br> Light it.<br> Look up. That's it.<br> All the time thinking, thinking.<br> That's it.<br> That's a lot better.<br> Wasn't that much better?<br> Jonathan was a perfectionist.<br> When he loved a scene,<br> money meant nothing...<br> ... fatigue even less,<br> his or anyone else's.<br> We did it over and over and over<br> till we could hardly stand.<br> - All right, cut. How was that?<br> - Try it again.<br> Jonathan! For heaven's sake!<br> Fun is fun!<br> - Did they get it?<br> - I don't know. They're still arguing.<br> Oh, brother!<br> This is amateur night in Dixie!<br> They'll make up their minds<br> or lose Baby.<br> - Hi, Baby.<br> - You were gonna get me into pictures.<br> It takes a little while, Baby.<br> I worked as an extra for three years.<br> - This is good experience.<br> - This is experience?<br> By the time I get a speaking part,<br> they'll have to carry me.<br> - You're pretty when you're mad.<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> Wrap it up!<br> Get these people outside!<br> Stage setup first thing in the morning!<br> - Good night, Miss Lorrison.<br> - Good night, George.<br> I thought that take was good.<br> Pretty good,<br> but I wanna get more out of Gaucho.<br> - Happy?<br> - Very.<br> - Are you, Jonathan?<br> - Very.<br> - May I buy you dinner tonight?<br> - And tomorrow night.<br> That's the look I want on that wedding<br> scene. Can you give me that?<br> I'll try.<br> Mr. Shields, we're five over budget.<br> I need you to sign these sheets<br> before I can send out the checks.<br> Good night.<br> Hurry up, Baby.<br> Be an angel, bring my car around.<br> S, seor. You want me<br> to wash it for you too?<br> Georgia.<br> - You were wonderful in that scene.<br> - Thank you.<br> Every day I watch you grow<br> more and more an actress.<br> To give truth to a performance,<br> there's nothing like love.<br> - Love is for the very young.<br> - Love is for the birds!<br> - Good night, Georgia.<br> - Good night, Gaucho.<br> Lila, that wasn't nice!<br> I guess it depends on<br> who a girl has dinner with.<br> Shh, Baby.<br> She gets to be a star,<br> I get to park a convertible.<br> Don't talk like that about Georgia,<br> or Jonathan. He is a great man.<br> There are no great men, buster.<br> There's only men.<br> The last two weeks of the picture,<br> I was in a dream...<br> ... a bad dream.<br> All right, Jonathan!<br> Action!<br> - They're ready, Miss Lorrison.<br> - She'll be right there.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> I feel sick and frightened.<br> You're tired.<br> You've been trying so hard.<br> But they think I'm such a fool,<br> or temperamental...<br> It's only a few more days.<br> I feel like I'm gonna scream.<br> I can't help myself.<br> Hurry, Miss Lorrison.<br> Please, they're all waiting.<br> We were on the last scene.<br> We finished a little before dawn.<br> We're alone now.<br> And I can talk to you.<br> Now I can tell you<br> what I never could tell you before.<br> You must forgive me, my darling.<br> You mustn't mind my crying...<br> ...now that it's too late.<br> Now, at last, I can tell you.<br> I love you, Gregory.<br> I love you. I love you so...<br> After the opening, there was a party.<br> It was a lovely top-of-the-world party.<br> It was my party,<br> and everybody was there.<br> And everybody made<br> a fuss over me. Everybody...<br> ... but Jonathan.<br> You wouldn't come to my party,<br> so I brought my party to you.<br> Jonathan, it was so wonderful.<br> Everything you wanted for me.<br> Just as you promised.<br> They applauded, cheered,<br> oohed and aahed.<br> Georgia, go back and enjoy it.<br> But there's no one to enjoy it with.<br> Why, that's silly. Everybody in town<br> is fighting to be near the new star.<br> You know what I mean, Jonathan.<br> Georgia, I have to be alone tonight.<br> After a picture's done,<br> something happens.<br> It's a feeling of letdown, of emptiness.<br> It's bad. It gets worse.<br> I can't help it.<br> I know. Syd and Harry have told me<br> about that. But tonight...<br> I'd only depress you.<br> I want you to go back now.<br> - You've got bows to take. Take them!<br> - Darling.<br> I was afraid you might be angry<br> or resent my coming here...<br> ...but I had to take that chance.<br> Right in the middle of everything,<br> suddenly I knew one thing so clearly.<br> The party is where you are:<br> Depressed or gay or angry...<br> ...or tender or in any of your moods.<br> I know them all.<br> Let's have our party.<br> We've got so much to celebrate.<br> We'll ice the champagne.<br> We'll light the fire.<br> We'll put on the records and dance.<br> I'll help you pull yourself out of this<br> the way you helped me.<br> Give me that chance, darling?<br> Please?<br> Please don't shut me out.<br> Please.<br> You said you'd get rid of her quick.<br> Now, go back to your party.<br> The picture's finished, Georgia.<br> You're business, I'm company.<br> Shut up!<br> Shut up, and get back upstairs!<br> Oh, I forgot to tell you, Georgia.<br> I saw the picture.<br> I thought you were swell.<br> Good night, Georgia.<br> Stop looking like that.<br> Remember, I didn't ask you here.<br> You couldn't stay where you belong.<br> You couldn't enjoy<br> what I made possible for you.<br> You'd rather have this.<br> Well, congratulations.<br> You've got it all laid out for you...<br> ...so you can wallow in self-pity.<br> A betrayed woman, the wounded doe,<br> with all the dribble that goes with it.<br> "He doesn't love me. He was lying.<br> Lovely moments, tender words.<br> He's lying. He's cheap and cruel!<br> That low woman Lila!"<br> Well, maybe I like Lilas.<br> Maybe I like to be cheap sometimes.<br> Maybe everybody does.<br> Or don't you remember?<br> Get that look off your face!<br> Who gave you the right to dig into me<br> and decide what I'm like?<br> How do you know<br> how I feel about you?<br> Maybe I don't want anybody<br> to own me, you or anybody. Get out!<br> Get out!<br> I told you I'd never work for<br> him again, and I never will.<br> I don't blame you, Georgia.<br> Jonathan certainly ruined you.<br> You were a drunk and a tramp playing<br> bit parts, and he made a star of you.<br> You had an ironclad contract<br> with Shields Productions.<br> Iron, I know, because I drew it myself.<br> Starting at $100 a week,<br> we owned you body and soul.<br> The next morning you walked<br> right into this office.<br> That same look on your face as now,<br> and you threw the contract in my face.<br> Jonathan let you do with it.<br> I wanted to take you to court.<br> But he said no.<br> So you signed with ANL...<br> ...and made them the millions<br> we should have made.<br> For the last seven years, you've been<br> in the top 10 in every popularity poll.<br> Yes, Jonathan sure fouled you up.<br> Jim, you're pretty happy<br> with yourself these days, aren't you?<br> You and your Poolutzer... Poolitzer.<br> "To James Lee Bartlow,<br> whose first book"...so and so...<br> ..."graduate of Harvard<br> and the Sorbonne"...<br> "1949, professor of Medieval History<br> at a leading Southern university."<br> Summer is the quietest time of year<br> in a college town, and the loveliest.<br> I was outlining what I hoped<br> would be my second novel.<br> My first, on which I'd labored<br> seven years, was just out.<br> Surprisingly, for a scholarly work<br> about early Virginia...<br> ... my book was enjoying<br> a brisk nationwide sale.<br> Possibly because it was<br> liberally peppered with sex...<br> ... because, after all, early Virginia<br> was liberally peppered with sex.<br> Was that why Hollywood had bought it?<br> Why did I stay away from home<br> that afternoon?<br> Because Rosemary, my wife,<br> was entertaining the symposium...<br> ... factory wives who met bimonthly...<br> ... to enjoy a little culture<br> and a lot of gossip.<br> Rosemary was reading a paper<br> on the island of St. Daniels...<br> ... which we visited the summer before.<br> "The techniques of courtship,<br> marriage and consummation.<br> These are the concern<br> of the anthropologist...<br> ...rather than of the sociologist.<br> They are certainly<br> not for the drawing room.<br> The Longhorns:<br> Dating back to the misty past<br> of the first Spanish explorers..."<br> Her paper seemed<br> to be getting a good reception.<br> Possibly because it was<br> liberally peppered with sex...<br> ... because, after all,<br> the island of St. Daniels...<br> ... is liberally peppered with sex.<br> I started to work.<br> James Lee doesn't mind one bit.<br> Do you, darling?<br> He never minds.<br> Autograph, Miss Rosser?<br> Dear Miss Rosser,<br> isn't this just like a man?<br> I fixed his study with everything<br> an author could want...<br> ...and there he sits<br> in a dreary old rocker...<br> ...clickety-clack<br> on that dilapidated old portable.<br> I suppose we'll be losing you<br> to Hollywood now, Professor Bartlow.<br> The James Lee Bartlows in Hollywood,<br> isn't that a ridiculous idea?<br> Besides which, what could Hollywood<br> possibly offer us?<br> Besides which,<br> Hollywood hasn't asked us.<br> What did he write?<br> Oh, professor! You shouldn't have!<br> Ladies, look what Mr. Bartlow wrote!<br> James Lee, you have<br> a very naughty mind...<br> ...I'm happy to say.<br> James Lee, no.<br> There are ladies out there. No...<br> I started to work.<br> Mrs. Bartlow says eat.<br> It'll do you good.<br> Thanks, Milly.<br> I started to work.<br> Hello.<br> Yes, this is Professor Bartlow.<br> Who?<br> Where?<br> Oh. Yes, put him on.<br> Hello, Mr. Shields.<br> Fine, thanks.<br> I heard on the extension.<br> Hollywood! Jonathan Shields.<br> Sure I'm glad you bought the book.<br> I hope your movie of it makes me<br> as happy as your check did.<br> No.<br> No, I'm sorry.<br> I don't see how I can.<br> Tell him you're working on<br> your new novel. Go on.<br> I need all summer<br> to work on my new book.<br> - Don't tell him what it's about.<br> - Get your hand away.<br> I'd rather not discuss it<br> until it's finished.<br> My, just listen to that man talk!<br> All expenses paid.<br> You just tell him you'll think it over.<br> No, it's impossible.<br> I can't come out now.<br> Say something charming<br> for goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Shields.<br> - James Lee, that was not charming.<br> He has enough charm for all three of us.<br> - He surely rubbed you the wrong way.<br> - He surely did.<br> Darling...<br> ...I don't want you to feel sorry<br> you didn't say yes to Mr. Shields.<br> What if we do spend the whole<br> hot summer here? It doesn't matter.<br> Someday, I know we'll get to travel<br> and see all those wonderful places.<br> So don't you ever feel one bit sorry<br> you didn't say yes, James Lee.<br> Does a trip to Hollywood<br> mean that much to you?<br> Me?!<br> After all, it was only for two weeks,<br> all expenses paid.<br> It's not like Mr. Shields<br> wanted me to write a screenplay.<br> All he wanted was to talk,<br> to get my ideas on his ideas.<br> - Is this everything?<br> - Yeah, that's all.<br> Mrs. Bartlow, is this bungalow<br> all right with you?<br> - It's completely enchanting!<br> - Good.<br> - The studio car is yours for the stay.<br> - Thank you.<br> I have to meet a guy from the syndicate.<br> He's a nice guy,<br> but he hated our last two pictures.<br> - Bye.<br> - When do I see the great man?<br> Jonathan? Drop around the studio<br> tomorrow. Not too early, not too late.<br> Bye, Mrs. Bartlow.<br> James Lee, come here.<br> Hurry up.<br> Hurry up!<br> Come on.<br> It's Georgia Lorrison...<br> ...living in the very next bungalow.<br> Now, what do you know?<br> That night Rosemary<br> wrote 32 postcards.<br> Next morning I mailed them,<br> and we went to the studio.<br> Look here, James Lee.<br> The dining room at Round Oak...<br> ...just the way we saw it<br> when you wrote it.<br> Just the way I saw it when I read it.<br> Look at that chandelier.<br> - It's Waterford, isn't it?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> You write in motion-picture terms.<br> You like movies?<br> - The good ones.<br> - Would you like to write the script?<br> - No.<br> - Why not?<br> You look much younger than I thought.<br> - Must take good care of yourself.<br> - I do.<br> So do I. I'm here for two weeks only.<br> Get your money's worth out of that.<br> There's never been such silver,<br> not even in Richmond.<br> I wouldn't have missed this for anything.<br> Mr. Shields, James Lee didn't think<br> it proper for me to come along today.<br> The professor's a man of rigid ideas.<br> We're delighted to have you with us.<br> See, darling. I knew it was plain<br> sociable for me to come and say hello.<br> Don't worry, Mr. Shields.<br> I won't be a nuisance.<br> When James Lee is busy with you,<br> I'll be busy with my own work.<br> - What kind of work is that?<br> - It's nothing, really.<br> But I did promise the symposium<br> I'd do a paper on Hollywood.<br> I realize in two weeks I can't do more<br> than barely scratch the surface.<br> Get the feel of things,<br> and then we'll get together.<br> - Shall I phone you?<br> - No, let me phone you.<br> Thank you, Mr. Shields.<br> It was wonderful fun.<br> I like being an author's wife.<br> It took time to learn the secret:<br> His work comes first.<br> - Visit us again.<br> - Thank you. Goodbye.<br> "His work comes first."<br> She would buy dark glasses<br> with his first salary check.<br> No wonder it took him seven years<br> to write a book.<br> Do you have to have him<br> to write your script?<br> Do you think you can keep him<br> in Hollywood?<br> He kept me, all right. Two weeks later<br> I signed with Shields Productions...<br> ... to write a treatment of<br> The Proud Land.<br> - So you like my ideas?<br> - Yes.<br> - All of them?<br> - No.<br> - Who is that? His picture is all over.<br> - That's my father.<br> Angry little man, wasn't he?<br> I'm not used to an office. I'm<br> used to a portable and a soft rocker.<br> - Superstitious mind?<br> - No.<br> Supersensitive rear.<br> I had them flown out.<br> I thought it'd make you happy.<br> - I gather I failed.<br> - You were pretty sure of yourself.<br> - Pretty sure I'd stay.<br> - Yes, I was.<br> I know the legend. Jonathan Shields...<br> ...the man will do anything<br> to get what he wants.<br> Thanks.<br> Shields Pictures Incorporated.<br> Well, I'm flattered you want me<br> and bitter you got me.<br> Where do I start?<br> Just read these scripts.<br> See how it's done.<br> Rough out a storyline,<br> and then we'll get to work.<br> Don't worry.<br> Some great movies...<br> ...are made by people<br> who hate each other.<br> - Then we should make a great movie.<br> - I usually do.<br> What about your last two?<br> I liked them.<br> I started to work.<br> Look!<br> How do you like it?<br> I'll be right down.<br> I started to work.<br> Hello.<br> What is it, Rosemary?<br> But, dear, I told you I can't.<br> I know it's Sunday, but I've only<br> written half a page all week.<br> All right, Rosemary.<br> Where is it?<br> Yes.<br> And?<br> Not so fast.<br> Walking out that way.<br> You were rude.<br> I don't care how you feel about Shields...<br> ...if you are a gentleman, there is<br> no justification for boorishness!<br> He asked me how my work was going.<br> What was I supposed to say? Great?<br> Who was that overgrown bullfighter<br> you danced with?<br> You mean Victor Ribera? Gaucho?<br> Why, I only danced with him twice.<br> - An hour each time.<br> - You do get nasty when you're jealous.<br> Like the time you carried on<br> in St. Daniels...<br> ...over that charming<br> young governor's aide.<br> - He was too charming.<br> - He meant nothing at all!<br> You were even jealous<br> at that Swiss exchange professor...<br> ...just because he was polite!<br> He was too polite.<br> Rosemary, let's get some sleep.<br> James Lee Bartlow, take a good look<br> at yourself in that mirror.<br> You've changed<br> since you've come to Hollywood...<br> ...and I don't mind telling you,<br> it's no change for the better.<br> Have I changed too?<br> I dare say I am getting<br> a little too big for my breeches.<br> They're pretty breeches.<br> James Lee, you have<br> a very naughty mind...<br> ...I'm happy to say.<br> Get me Gaucho.<br> Harry?<br> Oh, call Arrowhead.<br> Long distance, please.<br> Lake Arrowhead, California.<br> I'm going up the lake with James Lee.<br> We'll get this treatment written.<br> - When are you leaving?<br> - In an hour.<br> - The bank wants to talk to you.<br> - Tell them I said you could do it.<br> - They're getting tough.<br> - You're getting too old.<br> You got something there.<br> Hello, Gaucho?<br> Just a minute.<br> - Harry, you take care of it, will you?<br> - All right, I'll see what I can do.<br> Gaucho. Qu tal?<br> Muy bien.<br> How are you booked for social life?<br> Well, get yourself unbooked.<br> How would you like to squire<br> a genuine Virginia dame?<br> I said "squire."<br> Mrs. James Lee Bartlow.<br> Mister is going up the lake with me.<br> IKKeep her occupied, Gaucho,<br> so she doesn't get in our hair.<br> I started to work.<br> I worked all day from 7:00 till noon,<br> from 2:00 to 5:00.<br> There were no interruptions.<br> In the evenings,<br> we worked together.<br> Jonathan, that's my best scene!<br> You've cut it down to three lines!<br> Look, Jonathan,<br> I don't think you understand.<br> The boy's going away, probably to be<br> killed! So when the mother speaks...<br> She doesn't speak.<br> We move the camera in close.<br> She opens her mouth,<br> but is too emotional to speak.<br> What she feels<br> we let the audience imagine.<br> They'll imagine it better than any<br> words you and I could write.<br> All right with you?<br> Yes, professor.<br> Now for that last scene.<br> - Proud of yourself?<br> - A little.<br> Should be. Not a weak scene<br> in the whole treatment.<br> I'm proud of Rosemary too.<br> She didn't interrupt the whole time.<br> Pleasant, wasn't it?<br> To tell you the truth,<br> I missed her interruptions.<br> Even when she's a bother, she does it<br> in a gay, naive, Southern belle way.<br> Why didn't you try to put her<br> on paper as a woman in your book?<br> - I did try.<br> - Just wouldn't write?<br> Funny.<br> Maybe you just don't know her<br> well enough.<br> Check the radiator too.<br> What's her story?<br> Gaucho a friend of his?<br> Was she gonna marry Gaucho?<br> Were they flying<br> for a Mexican divorce?<br> - How long did she love him?<br> - When did he last see her?<br> He was a close friend of the Bartlows.<br> They were flying to the lake.<br> - His flight plan said Acapulco.<br> - What flight plan?<br> Don't you wanna play with the press?<br> Gaucho was a friend of the Bartlows.<br> He was flying her to the lake...<br> - Let Mr. Bartlow identify the body.<br> - Just a minute...<br> - Will you shut up!<br> - You stay out of it...<br> I wish... I wish an awful lot.<br> Maybe if I'd been here...<br> You didn't know about them, did you?<br> Sorry, Jonathan.<br> Of course, you didn't know.<br> Look, Jim, I'm not gonna let you<br> brood about her.<br> She's dead, and you're alive.<br> You can't do anything about it.<br> Neither can I.<br> Let's get to work, you and I.<br> Without Jonathan, I don't know what<br> I'd have done those next few months.<br> He put me to work<br> and kept me working.<br> When the shooting script<br> was finished...<br> ... he asked me to stay<br> for production meetings and casting.<br> You see Miss Ronley<br> as the star of The Proud Land.<br> But it was my impression<br> this was a woman of sex.<br> Miss Ronley has<br> the sex appeal of an angleworm.<br> - How about that, Jonathan?<br> - About what?<br> I like Linda Ronley.<br> - I wonder...<br> - Yes, Jim?<br> - It's not my department.<br> - Go ahead. You're among friends.<br> While writing the script,<br> I had one girl in mind.<br> She lives next to my bungalow.<br> I think she'd be fine.<br> Georgia Lorrison.<br> If you'd like me to give<br> her the script, I...<br> You have just broken a sacred taboo.<br> You've mentioned the unmentionable.<br> - That's enough.<br> - That's all right, Syd.<br> Georgia is the best.<br> The best actress. The best box office.<br> Her last three pictures<br> for Fred Amiel grossed to... Harry?<br> $ 7,600,000 domestic.<br> We try to get her, we'll be wasting<br> our time. She hates my guts.<br> Jim, if you wanna show her the script,<br> there's no way I can stop you.<br> What am I supposed to do?<br> Thank you for saying no?<br> What are you trying to do? Fight<br> Jonathan Shields' battles for him?<br> - It happens to be my book.<br> - It happens to be his picture.<br> You're the first one I know to begin<br> by hating him and end up liking him.<br> - Do you always work backwards?<br> - Do you still love him?<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Fred, do I still love Jonathan?<br> - No, you don't get me on that one.<br> - A stupid question for a writer.<br> Don't you know about first love?<br> You may grow out of it,<br> but you don't get over it.<br> I'm sorry, that was stupid of me.<br> No, no. I wouldn't want to get over<br> my first love either, quite.<br> Well, it's time you two met.<br> Fred Amiel, James Bartlow.<br> Guess who we were fighting about.<br> Jonathan's more than a man.<br> He's a habit-forming experience.<br> If they bottled him, he'd outsell ginger ale.<br> - Ready, Mr. Amiel?<br> - No, thanks, Timmy.<br> Georgia let me read your script,<br> it's a beautiful job.<br> I'd like to talk about your next one.<br> Goodbye, Georgia.<br> Nice to have met you.<br> Shooting started on The Proud Land<br> and everything went well...<br> ... until the fourth day,<br> then something happened.<br> Cut!<br> Close-up of the girl.<br> About there.<br> Save all...<br> Mr. Von Ellstein!<br> Would you come here, please?<br> Am I to understand<br> you consider this scene complete?<br> - I do.<br> - I don't. You call that directing?<br> I have for 32 years.<br> I see values and dimensions<br> you haven't begun to hit!<br> Perhaps not the ones I wish to hit.<br> I could make this scene a climax.<br> I could make every scene a climax.<br> If I did, I would be a bad director.<br> I like to think of myself<br> as one of the best.<br> A picture all climaxes is a necklace<br> without a string, it falls apart.<br> You must build to your big moment.<br> Sometimes you must build slowly.<br> If I want a lecture on the aesthetics<br> of motion pictures, I'll ask.<br> It won't be a cover-up for a shallow,<br> inept interpretation of a great scene!<br> - To be a director you need imagination.<br> - Whose imagination?<br> Yours or mine?<br> There's only one answer. You see<br> this picture one way and I another.<br> It could be done your way,<br> but not by me...<br> ...and not by any other director<br> who respects himself.<br> You know what you must do<br> to have it exactly as you want it?<br> You must direct this picture yourself.<br> To direct a picture,<br> a man needs humility.<br> Do you have humility, Mr. Shields?<br> Jonathan the director<br> was a new Jonathan.<br> He was patience personified.<br> He was tolerant, even-tempered,<br> considerate and indulgent...<br> ... to his crew, his cast and his writer.<br> Six months after he started shooting...<br> ... we saw the picture<br> for the first time.<br> - Nice job at cutting, Tom.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Shields.<br> - Nice work, Tom.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Beautiful production.<br> - Beautifully written, Jim.<br> - Beautifully produced.<br> - Chapman's photography was perfect.<br> Congratulate Walter on his sets,<br> Lucien on her costumes...<br> ...and Boris on his score.<br> - I liked the music.<br> Tell the director to have<br> his head examined.<br> He should've shot himself,<br> not the picture.<br> - It's not as bad as all that...<br> - I butchered it.<br> Von Ellstein should have been here.<br> He would have enjoyed this.<br> I have no tension, no timing,<br> no pace, nothing.<br> I took a beautiful, sensitive story...<br> ...and turned it<br> into a turgid, boring movie.<br> If it were anyone else,<br> I'd never release it.<br> - Who's got a cigarette?<br> - Here you are.<br> I've made pictures that lost money,<br> but they had something.<br> - This is nothing.<br> - You're being drastic.<br> All you've got to do is cut<br> the dead wood out...<br> Please.<br> - Harry, shelve the picture.<br> - Are you crazy? We can't do that.<br> We're in hock up to our necks.<br> We went way over budget.<br> - We've got to release it.<br> - There's your penny-pinching mind.<br> Shelve it.<br> We shelve it,<br> that's the end of Shields Productions.<br> Goodbye to 17 years' work.<br> Goodbye to every dime you've got.<br> - How about the money in the sock?<br> - There isn't any sock.<br> Your last two pictures<br> and this one took care of that.<br> And every dime of mine is gone<br> and every dime of Syd's.<br> That I didn't know.<br> The banks turned us down<br> on money for the last retakes.<br> Syd and I... Oh, well.<br> You were shooting,<br> and who could bother you then?<br> The hardheaded businessman.<br> The hardboiled press agent.<br> I won't release a picture<br> that I know is bad.<br> But other men do!<br> Their pictures don't say<br> "Jonathan Shields presents."<br> - Okay, what story shall I break?<br> - That's easy.<br> "Jonathan Shields Lays an Egg!"<br> - What you gonna do now?<br> - I'm tired, Jim.<br> - What are you gonna do now?<br> - You mind changing the subject?<br> I just played my big scene in there:<br> The Great Man Fails.<br> You want an encore?<br> - You sound like Sebastian.<br> - Who? Oh, your new book.<br> You told me to never let a leading<br> character feel sorry for himself.<br> - Not for long.<br> - I was wrong.<br> It's very comforting<br> to feel sorry for yourself.<br> - You're coming with me.<br> - What?<br> I've taken a cabin at Tahoe to finish<br> my new book. You're coming along.<br> - Why?<br> - Why not?<br> Besides, I work better<br> when you're around.<br> Can you wait a while?<br> - How long?<br> - Five minutes.<br> It'll take me that long to pack.<br> Sebastian sounds like some character.<br> You'll have trouble casting him.<br> - This is a book, not a movie.<br> - You'll sell it to pictures.<br> Gaucho could have done that part.<br> He was Sebastian.<br> The guy with the world on a string.<br> The big happy baboon.<br> I begged him, "Don't take that plane,<br> Gaucho." But no, not him. He...<br> Today is my day for mistakes.<br> Jim...<br> ...I didn't kill Rosemary.<br> Gaucho didn't kill her.<br> She killed herself.<br> Whether you like it or not,<br> you're better off.<br> She was a fool. She got in your way.<br> She interfered with your work.<br> She wasted your time.<br> She wasted you.<br> You're better off without her!<br> "A sensitive, unforgettable portrait<br> of a present-day Southern belle.<br> Gay and foolish, naive, shrewd,<br> and heartbreaking all at once."<br> Yes, Jim,<br> Jonathan sure destroyed you.<br> You came out of it with nothing.<br> Nothing but a Pulitzer Prize novel...<br> ...and the highest salary<br> of any writer in Hollywood.<br> Look, folks,<br> you've got to give the devil his due.<br> We all owe him something,<br> and you've had years to think it over.<br> - What do you owe him, Harry?<br> - Plenty.<br> All the times he told me<br> to shut my penny-pinching mouth.<br> To Jonathan I was always<br> just an overpaid bookkeeper.<br> But without him I probably would still<br> be putting costumes on cat men.<br> You know, when they list<br> the 10 best pictures ever made...<br> ...there are always<br> two or three of his on the list.<br> And I was with him when he made them.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Yes?<br> - Your call from Paris is ready.<br> Hello!<br> Hello. Yes, Jonathan.<br> I can hear perfectly.<br> Yes, they're here, all three of them.<br> All right, I'll ask them.<br> Jonathan wants to know:<br> Will you help him get started again?<br> Will you work with him just this once?<br> Will you do this picture with him?<br> Georgia?<br> Sorry, Jonathan.<br> No, I can't.<br> I'm sorry, Jonathan.<br> They're gone.<br> I'm sure it's a great idea, but, Jonathan...<br> ...this costs $4.80 a minute.<br> Don't tell me your idea,<br> write me.
