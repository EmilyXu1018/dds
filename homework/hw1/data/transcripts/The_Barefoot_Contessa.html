                        I suppose when you spend most<br> of your life in one profession<br> you develop what could be called<br> an occupational point of view<br> So maybe I can be forgiven<br> for the first thing I<br> thought of that morning<br> Because I found myself thinking that<br> the staging and the setting<br> even the lighting of Maria's funeral<br> were just what she would have wanted<br> My name is Harry Dawes<br> I've been a writer<br> and director of movies<br> for longer than I like to remember<br> I go way back: back<br> to when the movies<br> had two dimensions,<br> and one dimension<br> and sometimes no dimension at all<br> I wrote and directed all three<br> of the movies Maria D'Amata was in<br> Her short, full career,<br> from start to finish<br> I wrote it and directed it<br> On the screen, that is<br> What was I doing there?<br> The Fates or the Furies<br> or whoever wrote and<br> directed her short, full life<br> they took care of that<br> Anyway, there I stood<br> halfway around the world<br> from Hollywood and Vine<br> in a little graveyard<br> near Rapallo, Italy<br> watching them bury the<br> Contessa Torlato-Favrini<br> in ground she'd never<br> heard of six months ago<br> with a stone statue to mark the spot<br> Life, every now and then, behaves<br> as if it had seen<br> too many bad movies<br> When everything fits too well:<br> The beginning, the<br> middle and the end<br> from fade-in to fade-out<br> And where I faded in,<br> the contessa was not a contessa<br> She was not even a movie<br> star named Maria D'Amata<br> Where I faded in,<br> her name was Maria Vargas<br> and she danced in a<br> nightclub in Madrid, Spain<br> Ol!<br> Ol!<br> And so, once upon a time, three<br> years ago, we came to Madrid<br> to a not very fashionable<br> nightclub, to see Maria Vargas dance<br> Let me tell you who "we" were<br> The man with the sweaty<br> face and frightened eyes<br> was and is Oscar Muldoon<br> He's a public relations<br> man, which can be many things<br> unrelated and not public at all<br> The blonde was made<br> in Hollywood, USA<br> Her name was Myrna,<br> and she travelled<br> I was a writer and/or director,<br> who hadn't been doing too well<br> We were all in the<br> employ of Kirk Edwards<br> Meet Kirk Edwards<br> You're saying to yourself<br> "So, that's what he looks like"<br> "A Wall Street wizard who came<br> up from the streets of New York"<br> "Who came up from the bottom,<br> but never really left it"<br> Don't feel sorry for Kirk Edwards<br> Not unless you're a<br> hungry psychiatrist<br> Kirk was producing a<br> motion picture, his first<br> He had as much in common<br> with anything creative<br> as I have with nuclear physics<br> Well, we'd been scouting for<br> what is called,<br> delicately, a new face<br> By most standards, flying all the<br> way to Madrid to look for a new face<br> would seem like going<br> to a lot of trouble<br> But I've known producers<br> who'd travel further<br> for a good smoked whitefish<br> Hey, um... Hey, Mac!<br> "S, seor"<br> How come the band is takin' a break?<br> - Uh, please. Don't...<br> - Signorina<br> Seorita. You're<br> in Spain now, buster<br> Seorita whatsis... Maria Vargas.<br> She does not dance no more?<br> No more, seor<br> You mean she dance only<br> one time, then "finito"?<br> "S, no ms. " One<br> time, then "finito"<br> Well, maybe she could dance one<br> more time, just for tonight, eh?<br> She never dance more.<br> One time and no more.<br> Well, why you not make her<br> dance more? You the boss, eh?<br> Is Maria Vargas. Nobody<br> boss. Maria Vargas<br> Funny, I always thought a woman<br> was a two-time thing. Sing it, Oscar<br> Oscar, have her come to the table<br> I'm very sorry, seor,<br> but Seorita Vargas<br> does not sit at the<br> tables with the guests<br> Now, I'm sure you don't consider<br> Mr Kirk Edwards just<br> an ordinary guest<br> Well, I have said, it is not<br> possible with Seorita Vargas<br> Well, maybe just this once,<br> for Mr Kirk Edwards<br> you can make an<br> exception to your rule<br> But it's not my rule.<br> It's rule of Seorita Vargas<br> I'm sorry. Excuse me, ladies<br> and gentlemen. Excuse me.<br> Oscar, go get her<br> We'll be right back<br> You haven't had much<br> to say this trip, Harry<br> I'd counted on you for laughs<br> some of your well-known<br> bright remarks<br> Maybe going on the<br> wagon makes a man dull<br> Could be<br> Oscar hasn't touched his whisky<br> - No, thanks<br> - How long has it been?<br> - Five months, next Tuesday<br> - Let that be a lesson to you, Myrna<br> It's never too late<br> to develop character<br> I've got time<br> The fact that you<br> don't drink at all, Kirk<br> is the greatest argument<br> for drunkenness I know<br> Wanna know why I went on the<br> wagon when I went to work for you?<br> Because I didn't want you around<br> when my brain was befuddled<br> First thing I know,<br> you might buy my soul<br> You can't buy people's<br> souls. They belong to God.<br> - What's champagne in Spanish?<br> - Wait till Oscar gets back<br> Not always, Kirk. Sometimes<br> it's quite a tussle<br> - Remember Faust?<br> - I don't believe I do<br> Faust was something like you, Kirk<br> Except, instead of all<br> the money in the world<br> he had all the knowledge<br> But the one thing he never knew<br> like you, was a moment<br> of real happiness<br> So he made a deal with the Devil.<br> He'd trade his soul to the Devil<br> in return for that one<br> moment of real happiness.<br> How'd it turn out?<br> Well, God fought the<br> Devil for Faust's soul<br> It was a close fight<br> Most people think God won<br> I personally always<br> thought it wound up a draw<br> I think it's a silly story<br> No man with all that<br> money and knowledge<br> could never have been happy<br> Sure it's a silly story<br> Can you ever imagine Kirk<br> being in a spot like that?<br> Worst come to worst,<br> he'd just "buy" God<br> A woman who drinks is bad enough<br> But I will not stand for a<br> woman cursing and blaspheming God<br> Now get out of here.<br> Right now. Get out<br> This is Madrid, in Spain,<br> not Sunset Boulevard<br> We flew from Rome in your<br> private plane, remember?<br> Then let her find her own way back<br> There must be other planes,<br> trains, buses. Give her some money<br> Is she changing? Then why<br> didn't you bring her with you?<br> - She don't sit with the customers<br> - You talked to her?<br> Through the door.<br> She opened it that wide<br> That fella in Rome was right.<br> Her English ain't bad<br> - Did you tell her what it was about?<br> - She knew. And she knew who you were<br> She don't sit at the<br> tables with the customers<br> One of the waiters tells me she's<br> got a reputation for not mingling<br> Do you suppose that, just this<br> once, you might have to go yourself?<br> This time, I want "you" to go<br> Sorry, my contract and the<br> bylaws of my various guilds<br> call for me to render my services<br> to you as a writer and a director<br> I'm not required to do<br> your... public relations<br> Look who's a candidate<br> for the Christopher Award<br> An ex-drunk who's<br> fallen on his face<br> in front of half of central casting<br> Shut up, Oscar<br> Now, this is as good a time as any<br> to get our relationship<br> straight, once and for all<br> You work for me. I pay you.<br> That means only one thing to me<br> whether you're a director or<br> a janitor in one of my plants:<br> I'm your boss<br> I'm also perfectly willing and able<br> to cancel this entire<br> production right now<br> Pay you off and write you off<br> The government will be<br> paying for most of it anyway<br> With Oscar's help,<br> I can let it be known<br> your script wasn't worth shooting<br> and that you were in<br> no condition to shoot it<br> Maybe you went off<br> the wagon. Who knows?<br> The majors aren't wanting you anyway<br> And if I can't afford you<br> as an independent, who can?<br> All that, just to meet a new face<br> All that, because I<br> want you to do what I say<br> even if it's picking up<br> my hat when I tell you to<br> Give me some money,<br> Oscar, to get back to Rome<br> I'll ad-lib the rest of the way<br> Why don't you come too, Harry?<br> You might as well put whisky in<br> that. And don't worry about your soul<br> You must have lost it at<br> some preview, a long time ago<br> Um...<br> Seorita Vargas?<br> Gracias<br> Seorita, your bare feet are showing<br> Now, I don't speak Spanish,<br> you don't speak english<br> so the only way we can<br> make any progress is to...<br> - I did not say to come in<br> - You did not say to stay out<br> - You did not actually say nothing<br> - Anything<br> Your English is very good<br> Where'd you learn it?<br> - This man, he is my cousin<br> - This man, he is your cousin<br> Did you come for the same reason<br> as the man with sweat on his face?<br> Yes. But, as you see, I<br> have no sweat on my face<br> Mr Edwards thought I<br> might persuade you...<br> I do not mingle with the customers<br> Only your cousin?<br> The man with the<br> sweat was more pleasant<br> Not really. Do you know<br> who Mr Kirk Edwards is?<br> I have heard of him.<br> He is the owner of Wall Street<br> That is correct. Recently, however,<br> he decided to produce motion pictures<br> and for that purpose he's<br> just bought California, too.<br> - And now he wants to buy me?<br> - Not exactly<br> Mr Kirk Edwards is looking<br> for somebody... like you<br> to play in his first production<br> and he wants to talk to you about it<br> - Who are you?<br> - Oh, I'm not important<br> I'm writing the film and I'll<br> direct it. My name is Harry Dawes<br> Harry Dawes<br> Harry Dawes<br> Did you not once direct Jean<br> Harlow and Carole Lombard?<br> You must have seen movies<br> when you were very little<br> How did you know my name? Only<br> one out of 10,000 moviegoers...<br> Oh, I can name to you Lubitsch and<br> Fleming and Van Dyke and La Cava<br> - You didn't think I was<br> dead too, did you? - Maria!<br> My cousin, he plays in the orchestra<br> - He had to go back to work<br> - Through the window?<br> That's a funny way<br> for a cousin to leave<br> In Hollywood, it is not<br> easy to become a star<br> Ah, where is it easy?<br> In Madrid, here at<br> least I'm a little star<br> Why should I take the<br> chance that I lose it?<br> - Do you know what a screen test is?<br> - Yes<br> We could make it in<br> Rome. Nobody would know<br> If it doesn't work out,<br> you'll have lost nothing<br> It can't hurt you<br> to meet Kirk Edwards<br> Nobody could accuse you of mingling<br> A business conference with one<br> of the richest men in the world<br> Could you teach me to act, Mr Dawes?<br> If you can act, I can help you<br> If you can't, nobody can teach you<br> Why did not Mr Kirk Edwards<br> come to ask me himself?<br> I'm sure he would<br> have been delighted<br> But since I'm the director...<br> Do all directors come<br> to ask young women<br> to sit with their producers?<br> Um... Not... not all<br> I think a man who<br> can write something<br> and can help someone to act<br> is worth much more than<br> a man who only has money<br> If and when you become an actress,<br> don't ever say that in public<br> You never know who's listening. Hm?<br> Seorita, this is Oscar Muldoon,<br> whom I'm sure you recognise<br> Meet Kirk Edwards.<br> Don't get up, Mr Edwards<br> Sorry we got here too<br> late to see you dance<br> We certainly are, seorita, because<br> we understand you got a lot of talent<br> And that's the one<br> thing that could make<br> Mr Edwards fly all the way from Rome<br> All the way from California. Talent.<br> And where other men go for a<br> pretty face or a pair of legs<br> talent is what Mr<br> Kirk Edwards worships<br> It's his religion, you might almost say<br> Something to eat, seorita? Waiter!<br> "Mangiare? Poco di vino," seorita?<br> - Do you speak Spanish, seor?<br> - Just a couple of words<br> Not even that. One<br> of them was Italian<br> Speak only English, please<br> A whisky for me, like before<br> Now, did Mr Dawes have<br> a chance to tell you<br> what Mr Edwards has in mind?<br> Oh, you wouldn't know, of course<br> who Mr Harry Dawes<br> is, in his own name<br> He is only one of<br> the top two or three<br> writers and directors<br> in the whole world<br> I only want to indicate to you<br> by this how Mr Edwards does things<br> Only the top, the class,<br> the finest money can buy<br> all the way up and down the line<br> Mr Edwards doesn't have to<br> watch the pennies. You know that?<br> I don't want to<br> throw Oscar off pitch<br> but I told Seorita<br> Vargas what this was about<br> I said we could<br> shoot the test in Rome<br> Seorita... Miss Vargas...<br> We'll have to change<br> that name. Maria<br> Naturally, Mr Edwards will pay<br> your expenses while you're tested<br> and if it works out, you'll be put<br> under contract to him personally<br> And you'll be paid in dollars.<br> Not pesetas, but dollars<br> - Maybe $100 a week to start with<br> - How much is that in pesetas?<br> Maybe $200 a week. We<br> can work that out later.<br> The point is, Mr Edwards is<br> going to leave no stone unturned<br> to develop your talent<br> and make you happy<br> Afraid you'll be lonely,<br> far away in Hollywood?<br> There's no reason why, after a<br> time, we can't send for your mother<br> After all, a girl likes to<br> have her mother with her. Right?<br> I would not like to<br> have my mother with me<br> Why not?<br> - Because I do not like my mother<br> - I'm sure you don't mean that<br> - Every mother should be loved<br> - If they deserve it<br> We can work all that out later too<br> The point is, the miracle has<br> happened and a great career is yours<br> No strings attached, no jokers<br> All Mr Edwards wants<br> is for the world<br> to enjoy your talent<br> and for you to be happy<br> And what does he get out of it?<br> Just your gratitude<br> What does he ever get out of the<br> things he does? Money? Power? Fame?<br> Nah. He's got all those<br> All that he can look forward<br> to is the honest gratitude<br> of the little people that he<br> helps, like you and me and Mr Dawes<br> Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?<br> I... have to telephone somebody<br> Please excuse me, Mr Dawes<br> Ah, Muldoon, you're a charmer<br> The little birds<br> right out of the trees<br> Signor Edwards, we're checked and<br> are ready whenever you are, sir<br> Oscar, go hurry her up. She<br> can buy what she needs in Rome<br> Right<br> Right now, Kirk, I wish my bankroll<br> was about one million dollars<br> - What would you do with them?<br> - I'd bet you the whole million that<br> this time, Oscar charmed the<br> little bird right back into the tree<br> He'll come up empty, Kirk<br> The trouble with you is you never know<br> where scripts leave<br> off and life begins<br> Ah, Muldoon, you're a charmer<br> You'd be so much more charming<br> if only you didn't sweat so much<br> She's gone. She never even went<br> back to the room. Nobody knows where<br> - I can't understand it<br> - We're leaving right now<br> Without you, Harry<br> We'll take off in one hour. You<br> find her and bring her with you<br> Don't show up without her<br> Just cable your agent collect...<br> if you've still got an agent<br> This is for the check<br> Kirk was wrong when<br> he said I didn't know<br> where scripts left<br> off and life began<br> A script has to make<br> sense, and life doesn't<br> Any self-respecting script would<br> have had me swallow Oscar's whisky<br> and go off on a bat<br> But it wasn't a script.<br> Right now, I wish it had been<br> The script would have made<br> so much more sense about<br> all of us than life did<br> Maria Vargas?<br> Seora Vargas?<br> I'm sorry. "No hablo espaol. "<br> I look for Maria Vargas<br> Wait a minute. This is important<br> Mucho importante<br> Why to find my sister<br> is so important?<br> Ah, Doctor Livingstone<br> - You got cigarettes?<br> - Help yourself<br> Keep the pack. I've got more<br> I'm a film director and I<br> talked to your sister tonight<br> about going to America<br> to play in the movies.<br> I want to talk to her again<br> It's good you no understand<br> my mother. Is liar<br> Why not fight this out<br> later? I haven't much time<br> I don't know what your troubles are<br> but I must find Maria.<br> Every minute counts<br> My mother forbids<br> Maria to go to America<br> - What does Maria say?<br> - I think we can talk better outside<br> - My brother took all your cigarettes?<br> - I have another pack<br> - What did you tell your mother?<br> - Just now?<br> Uh-huh<br> I told her if she said one more<br> word, I would go to America,<br> even if I did not want to go<br> - Are you in trouble with Mr Edwards?<br> - In a way<br> - Because I ran away?<br> - Mm-hm<br> I do not like Mr Kirk Edwards<br> You're standing at the<br> end of a long, long line<br> Somehow, to me, he<br> is not a healthy man<br> Somehow, he's sick<br> And I cannot bear to<br> watch sick people be sick<br> That is why so suddenly<br> I had to go away<br> Mr Dawes, do you think<br> really that I could be a star?<br> There's one phrase I've<br> avoided like the plague<br> because it never worked out<br> With you, I think it would.<br> You couldn't miss<br> I think that I am pretty enough<br> but I would not want<br> to be that kind of star<br> Pretty enough? Any woman that can<br> use the moon for a key light...<br> Key light? What is that?<br> Your own special light when the stage<br> is all lit up. It shines only on you<br> - Like the moon<br> - Like the moon<br> You must learn how to find<br> it out of all the other lights<br> How never to lose it.<br> How to make it do things<br> for your eyes, lips and hair<br> - But this is not acting<br> - No, this is not acting<br> And it's not all you<br> have to learn either<br> But... if I could act a little<br> would you help me to become a really<br> good actress? Would you help me?<br> What makes a man want to write<br> about people, or direct people<br> is because usually he has a sort of<br> sixth sense about<br> them, or thinks he has<br> Like a witch<br> Now, my five ordinary senses<br> what with alcohol and the<br> rest, are nothing special<br> But I have a sixth sense<br> that any witch in the world would<br> give her left broomstick to have<br> And... with sense number six,<br> you feel something about me<br> Therefore, owing to circumstances<br> which believe me,<br> are beyond my control<br> I hereby advise you not to<br> come to Rome to make the test<br> Not to come to America.<br> At least, not for a while<br> - At least, not...<br> - At least, not to Mr Kirk Edwards<br> - Is that what you fear?<br> - Part of it<br> That's the only part<br> I can put into words<br> Or perhaps you want me for yourself<br> and you are afraid Mr Edwards' money<br> will make him more<br> attractive than you<br> What makes women think that money<br> makes a man feel more attractive?<br> I never met a rich<br> man who didn't think<br> he was being loved<br> in spite of his money<br> - And you? - Me? Well, I'm afraid<br> I've had three wives<br> I've been around with actresses,<br> female writers, singers, painters<br> even a female agent<br> But I don't think I've met<br> more than three women in my life<br> Six months or so ago,<br> I fell in love with one of 'em<br> - Is she an actress?<br> - No, I told you. She's a woman<br> - Does she have to work?<br> - Script girl. Her name is Jerry<br> - She has the name of a man<br> - There is no further resemblance<br> - What is a script girl?<br> - You find out<br> Apparently, your sense number<br> six has changed its mind<br> No,I've just come to the realisation<br> that it's none of my business<br> - You now want me to go?<br> - It's up to you<br> I have no fear of Mr Kirk Edwards<br> America is a rich<br> and powerful country<br> but you have no monopoly on evil men<br> I have known them since<br> I was a very little girl<br> - Not like Kirk - They did not have<br> millions of dollars<br> But, to a girl with<br> nothing, a man with hundreds<br> is as rich as one with millions<br> I do not say this<br> with pride, Mr Dawes<br> Nor do I want it to sound<br> like one of the foolish things<br> we laugh at in the movies<br> But no man has ever paid for me<br> and I do not think any man ever will<br> Then... why not with pride?<br> Because it has not<br> been out of goodness<br> Not even because<br> I've tried to be good<br> I have nothing to say about<br> it, Mr Dawes, about whom I love<br> It is a kind of sickness<br> And, as I have said, I cannot<br> bear to be with sick people<br> But when the sick one is<br> yourself, you cannot run away<br> When I was a little<br> girl, like so many others<br> there was no money<br> to buy shoes for me.<br> And when the bombs<br> came, in the civil war<br> I used to bury myself in the<br> dirt of the ruins to be safe<br> I would lie there, safe in the dirt<br> and wiggle my toes<br> and listen to the noise<br> and dream of someday being<br> a fine lady, in fine shoes.<br> I hate shoes, Mr Dawes<br> I wear them to dance<br> and to show myself<br> but I feel afraid in shoes<br> And I feel safe with<br> my feet in the dirt<br> My words in English are so simple<br> And yet what I want to<br> say is not simple at all<br> Even in my own language<br> my brain and my words<br> could not say it, I'm afraid<br> There's more to<br> talking than just words<br> And you have one more<br> sense than other people<br> For instance, you understood<br> about my cousin right away<br> And when I was older<br> and the bombs still came<br> just to bury myself in the<br> dirt was not enough to be safe<br> I needed someone to be with me<br> Someone to love, to<br> love me, to make me safe<br> I needed it. I still<br> need it when I'm afraid<br> Like a baby who needs<br> a light on in the dark<br> I need to be loved when I'm<br> hiding in the dirt, and afraid<br> But the bombs are gone<br> You surprise me, Mr Dawes<br> Is fear gone?<br> - What are you afraid of?<br> - The same as everybody else<br> The same as you<br> Of being exposed and unprotected<br> Like Mr Kirk Edwards<br> without his money<br> Like you, as you used<br> to be without your drink<br> or now without your<br> script girl, who loves you<br> Like me, in my shoes and on<br> display for men and women to examine<br> for different reasons<br> Many men must be in love with you<br> In the dirt, it's hard to tell<br> Haven't "you" been in love?<br> From the dirt, it's easy<br> to look into the clouds<br> Has Mr Kirk Edwards already<br> flown away in his private plane<br> all covered with diamonds and stars?<br> Or, by now, has it<br> changed into a "calabaza?"<br> Oh, that must be<br> Spanish for "pumpkin"<br> We still have time, if you're coming<br> - Yes<br> - Then you'd better get your things<br> I have them<br> Then you'll want to say goodbye<br> I've no desire to look<br> at my mother once more<br> and I would only confuse "pap<br> Pedro will take care of him<br> Con Dios, pap<br> I am ready, Mr Dawes<br> You forgot your shoes<br> No. I did not forget them.<br> What happened next,<br> if you go to movies<br> or if you've ever sat under<br> a dryer or in a waiting room<br> is history<br> Movie history. The facts and figures<br> and fantasy of Maria's success<br> There are some, though, you<br> wouldn't have found in the textbooks<br> You've seen it and<br> read it a thousand times<br> It's one of the most tiresome<br> clichs of storytelling<br> It really happens once<br> or twice in a generation<br> But that first test of Maria Vargas<br> lit up all the lights<br> in show business<br> I had taken it upon myself<br> to invite the highest movie<br> brass I could find in Rome<br> Mr Black of America, Monsieur Blue<br> of France, and Mr Brown of England<br> The difference between European<br> and American movie magnates<br> is astonishing<br> There is absolutely none<br> Kirk, my dear fellow, I know<br> just what you have in mind<br> I couldn't agree more.<br> A British production...<br> I've got the perfect story...<br> You're not the type<br> to fool around with...<br> Now just a minute,<br> gentleman. In the first place<br> this young lady is<br> under exclusive contract<br> to Mr Kirk Edwards, of course<br> He cannot discuss her future<br> availability at this time<br> Secondly, this was a private showing<br> of a private test which<br> belongs to Mr Edwards<br> And I consider your presence here<br> highly irregular and unethical<br> Are you out of your mind,<br> Muldoon? You invited me<br> - Who, me?<br> - You must remember asking me<br> You suggested I come<br> in after the lights were out<br> in case I disturbed Mr Edwards<br> - Boss, I swear to you on my life...<br> - What about it, Harry?<br> I'm afraid I'm the guilty one.<br> I invited you, gentlemen<br> I used Oscar's name<br> because, franquely<br> I was afraid you<br> wouldn't be into my name<br> - What is your name, monsieur?<br> - He's Harry Dawes<br> I imagined you'd be<br> a much older man, Mr Dawes<br> I was, up to the<br> minute I saw this test<br> I'm flying to Paris tonight, Harry.<br> Drop in this afternoon<br> - I'm at the Excelsior<br> - Sorry, Max<br> - Not business. Just old friends<br> - How old? Since the test?<br> Why'd you have us come here, Harry?<br> Well, I should have<br> checked with Oscar Muldoon<br> It's not really a<br> director's function<br> But in Mr Edwards' organisation,<br> we all do all sorts of things<br> I wanted to make sure<br> that the leaders of our industry<br> knew about the contribution<br> Mr Edwards was going to make to it<br> "Alors," it was a "grand plaisir"<br> May I offer a ride<br> to any one of you?<br> I'll take you up on<br> that, if I may, Ren<br> - See you in London<br> - Au revoir, messieurs<br> Any time this afternoon,<br> Harry, if you get the chance<br> - Sorry, Max<br> - I'm at the Excelsior<br> Well, it's a great art we're<br> doing business in, gentlemen<br> Everybody be happy<br> Her make-up's too dark and too much<br> Hair and wardrobe have<br> got to be much more simple<br> No tricks. The less between<br> her and the camera, the better<br> The voice is good. Well placed<br> I don't want a voice<br> coach within a mile of her<br> How much closer will "you" be?<br> - What's that?<br> - How much closer have you been?<br> To Maria?<br> Coming from anybody else<br> that would be a compliment<br> What were those men doing here?<br> I've not answered<br> your first question yet<br> - I know the answer<br> - No, you don't<br> You won't admit it<br> It'd mean something is<br> possible between men and women<br> besides the few,<br> simple, physiological<br> relationships you know about<br> OK, that answer will satisfy<br> the Screenwriters Guild<br> Now tell us why you<br> planted those men in here<br> Maybe your master knows the answer<br> to that too, or doesn't wanna know<br> - I wanna know<br> - It's pretty long<br> We got the room booked<br> for the whole morning<br> It won't take that long<br> Kirk, Maria's made a chump out<br> of you. She's laughed at you<br> And you won't do<br> better. You'll do worse<br> Now, this pleases me and<br> frightens me. Because I know you<br> You're capable of destroying<br> a woman who's laughed at you<br> You've destroyed women who<br> loved you, so why not Maria?<br> And you're capable of burning<br> that test, as great as it is<br> and making it known she<br> had nothing worth testing<br> But right now, the name<br> and fame of Maria Vargas<br> is on its way to New York,<br> Hollywood, London and Paris.<br> - Does that answer your question?<br> - You can't get away with this<br> You're being disloyal, Oscar. You're<br> stealing dialogue from television<br> And you lied to those gentlemen<br> You can be forgiven<br> beaucause It's your job to lie<br> But you lied when you said<br> Maria was under contract to Kirk<br> - Isn't she?<br> - Well, I...<br> Those were your exact instructions,<br> Kirk, so don't punish Oscar for it<br> No contract till after<br> the test, remember?<br> You were going to use it<br> for one more pitch<br> Well, right now, it's after the test<br> And Maria Vargas will not<br> sign a contract with you<br> She's under contract<br> to "you. " Is that it?<br> Kirk, if ever a characterisation<br> followed a straight line, yours does<br> No, she's not under contract to<br> me because I'm not in that business<br> But what I tell Maria<br> to do, she will do<br> With her shoes on, that is<br> What's her shoes<br> got to do with it?<br> Nothing. Of course, you can<br> call off the production right now<br> Write it off, write me off and Maria<br> The government will pay<br> for most of it anyway<br> And I'll go see Max Black at<br> the Excelsior this afternoon<br> All right, let's go back to<br> Hollywood and make this movie<br> After that, Maria's on her own<br> And you can keep on looking for<br> new faces. The world's full of 'em<br> But you'll never find another Maria<br> You will find what you're<br> looking for, I'm sure<br> - Harry...<br> - Hm?<br> Nothin'<br> If ever a funeral laid<br> an egg, that one did<br> Standing round the grave, maybe<br> two dozen nobodies. A great finish<br> You just don't bury<br> a famous movie star<br> like she was an unidentified body<br> Well, it figured. It was like that<br> from the minute I laid eyes on her<br> Nothing worked according<br> to the book. Not my book, anyway<br> From the minute she waved<br> at the Statue of Liberty<br> everybody wanted to know<br> everything about Maria<br> And they wound up knowing nothing,<br> because there was nothing to know<br> Believe me, what they<br> said in Madrid was true<br> This bundle of passion, this hot<br> flame that burned from the screen<br> was a real untouchable<br> The columns and the wolves<br> were after me night and day<br> But how could I tell them<br> who she was with or when<br> when I didn't even<br> know who she knew?<br> I can tell you this:<br> It is entirely possible<br> that Maria D'Amata went to her grave<br> without ever being<br> inside of the Stork<br> El Morocco, Ciro's or the Mocambo<br> You got to admit this is not normal<br> But what was normal about this<br> whole business from start to finish?<br> Here is a doll who, on the<br> opening night of her first picture<br> with no known interest<br> in men, much less romance<br> whose private life<br> is strictly private<br> but who, the people have<br> decided, is already a star<br> This is the night I<br> first begin to think<br> maybe the public<br> has a mind of its own<br> Who else but Maria D'Amata would<br> show up at her world premiere alone<br> together with a couple<br> that everybody knew were<br> in love with each other?<br> It was real love<br> with Harry and Jerry<br> You could tell it was<br> because they didn't give out<br> interviews about getting married<br> Maria D'Amata. Whatever it is<br> - you name it<br> Whether you're born with it<br> or catch it from a public<br> drinking cup, Maria had it<br> The people with the money in their<br> hot little hands put her up there<br> and she could do no wrong<br> But I can remember very well<br> the day it did look like<br> the roof fell in on all of us<br> It was in London.<br> Back in the States<br> the picture was a smash<br> from coast to coast<br> I and Kirk Edwards had flown<br> over to see S Montague Brown<br> who wanted it for his<br> theatres in England<br> I could tell right<br> away something was wrong<br> Kirk didn't even look at me<br> And S Montague Brown<br> was eating and drinking<br> as if the Labour Party had<br> just been elected unanimously<br> May I know what the<br> depression is about?<br> - Maria<br> - What about Maria?<br> Maria's mother is dead<br> Everybody's mother's<br> gotta die sometime<br> Don't let it get you down like this<br> As a matter of fact, we can milk this<br> for some good exploitation in Spain<br> Maybe even worldwide. A big church<br> funeral, using pesetas, remember<br> Oscar, shut up<br> Mr Muldoon, it seems that Maria's<br> mother was murdered by Maria's father<br> Murdered? Her father<br> murdered her mother? When?<br> - Last night<br> - How'd you hear about this?<br> The Madrid office just telephoned<br> The papers? Has it<br> got to the papers?<br> Not yet<br> As you know, over here crime is<br> not exploited to sell newspapers<br> Without it you could<br> print the three main papers<br> in England on postage stamps<br> I am not interested<br> in selling newspapers<br> or in debating good and bad taste<br> The newspapers have<br> not yet picked it up<br> and won't, as long as<br> Maria stays out of it<br> Boss, you're 100% right<br> We gotta keep her out of it.<br> Does she know about it yet?<br> I've put in a call to Harry<br> Dawes. He can find out<br> - You want Harry to tell her?<br> - Of course not<br> Certainly not until the trial is<br> over and it's too late to be news<br> And we're finished<br> playing the key cities<br> Boss, you think of everything<br> Ah, what a business, show business<br> For years you sweat<br> and dream and dig<br> and finally you come<br> up with the jackpot<br> You've made it. You got a right to<br> open your collar, take off your shoes<br> and relax in Las Vegas<br> for the rest of your life<br> So what happens? Her father<br> chokes her mother to death<br> It could make ya cry<br> Montague, if there's one thing I<br> know about, it's Mr John Q Public<br> He wants clean people on the<br> screen for his children to look at<br> Don't let the eggheads<br> tell you he wants<br> high-class acting<br> and fancy dialogue<br> Oscar, the phone<br> He wants to forget his troubles,<br> look at clean people, escape<br> He don't wanna see<br> drunks, sex maniacs<br> divorcees, communists, murderers<br> And no children of murderers. He's<br> got enough of that at home. Hello?<br> Hello? Yeah, Mr Edwards<br> is right here. Put him on<br> - It's Harry, for you<br> - You talk to him<br> Hello? Hello? I hear nothing<br> Hello, Harry? No, this is Oscar<br> Yeah, how are you, Harry?<br> Fine, fine. Say,<br> how is it out there?<br> You don't say? Whaddaya know?<br> Nice day in California<br> Are you paying for<br> this call yourself, Oscar?<br> Harry, the reason we called...<br> What's new and all that, but also...<br> have you happened<br> to see Maria lately?<br> Oh, you just left her? Oh,<br> good, good. Say, how is she?<br> Fine, fine. Say, Harry, something<br> kind of important has come up<br> I say, something kind of<br> important has come up<br> Yeah. That maybe<br> you should know about<br> but that maybe you should keep<br> Maria from knowing about right now<br> Yeah. Yeah, it's got to<br> do with Maria in a way<br> Her old man knocked off her old lady<br> Her father murdered her mother<br> What?<br> I can't hear you, suddenly<br> What? What do you mean, you know?<br> Does Maria know?<br> How? The papers?<br> Her brother sent a cable?<br> Now, I hope Maria understands<br> that if the papers find out<br> it can not only ruin<br> the picture, but her also<br> She does? Harry says<br> Maria understands perfectly<br> And you too. This is no<br> time for you to be artistic<br> Remember, this is money out of<br> your pocket too, so take no chances<br> You do? Harry says<br> he understands also<br> I must say, Harry, you're being<br> very cooperative about this<br> And please extend our<br> heartfelt sympathy to Maria<br> at this time of her grief<br> What?<br> What? We can what?!<br> We can extend our sympathy<br> to Maria in person?<br> Harry, what are you talking about?<br> Didn't you tell me you just left her?<br> You left her at the airport?<br> She's flying to Madrid<br> to be with her father?<br> Who do we know in New York for<br> a snatch job between planes?<br> Dawes, are you outta your mind?<br> How could you let her do this? What?<br> What kind of an answer is that<br> against a $10 million world gross?<br> You don't say? Well, I'm just<br> as normal as you are, buster<br> Remember that in the years ahead<br> when you're directing<br> cigarette butts on TV<br> She loves her father<br> Neither the picture nor her<br> career mean as much to her<br> as being with her father<br> in his time of need<br> Starring Francis X Bushman<br> and Clara Kimball Young<br> Friday, Saturday and<br> Sunday at the Bijou<br> There will be a cornet<br> solo on Saturday night<br> Well, you remember<br> what happened<br> The trial drew more people than<br> "Madame X", and played better<br> Maria hired the best lawyers<br> in Spain. She never slept<br> You'd think it was her own<br> life she was fighting for<br> Harry and Jerry flew over<br> They couldn't help<br> much, but they were there<br> Nobody asked me and I wasn't<br> anybody's friend especially<br> but I stuck around<br> You couldn't help feeling<br> sorry for the old man<br> You could tell just by looking at him<br> that half the time he<br> didn't know where he was<br> And you wouldn't give a<br> bent kopeck for his chances<br> the way he kept admitting, over and<br> over, that he killed the old lady<br> Things picked up for the<br> home team when Maria's brother<br> a ganef if ever I saw<br> one, took the stand<br> He testified that his mother had<br> beaten up the old man many times<br> and how, on the night of the murder<br> she not only smashed<br> his radio, but hit him<br> But if I had to write down what<br> no actress should ever make public<br> I would copy Maria's testimony<br> in her father's defence<br> She left out nothing<br> She told about the squalor and filth<br> into which she and<br> her brother were born<br> and how they grew up like animals<br> She told about a mother<br> who was full of hate<br> and how she got back<br> the hate she gave<br> Maria handed Mom a rough<br> time on that witness stand<br> I couldn't help wondering how<br> this would go in box-office heaven<br> where Mom is the commanding saint<br> But that courtroom was<br> with her all the way<br> Some of them cried, even the judges<br> They must be appointed in Spain,<br> because I don't know of anybody<br> ever getting elected whose<br> mother was not an angel<br> And, as it turned out<br> the audiences of the whole world<br> could have been sitting<br> in that courtroom<br> From Scarsdale to<br> Singapore, they loved her<br> Her father beat the rap,<br> of course. Self-defence<br> And Maria walked out<br> of that courthouse a bigger star<br> than when she broke all<br> the rules by walking into it<br> So how are you going to figure it?<br> Suppose you're me<br> and what the public wants<br> and thinks is your business<br> You're standing in<br> the middle of them<br> asking yourself "Where<br> did I lose these people?"<br> You realise maybe the public<br> knows more about public<br> relations than you do<br> Maybe the public heart is<br> something you can't put on a chart<br> or penetrate with just money<br> You begin to think<br> that maybe, after all<br> Kirk Edwards couldn't really<br> walk across the English Channel<br> any time he wanted to<br> In many ways, Maria affected<br> Oscar more than any of us<br> Her father's trial<br> the fact that being honest<br> about something unpleasant<br> could make her more popular<br> than ever, it shook Oscar<br> His gods began to crumble<br> He became aware even of some clay<br> around the feet of Kirk Edwards<br> But two years went by<br> before the great god<br> Edwards toppled over<br> Two good and happy years,<br> for me at any rate<br> The night he fell to earth<br> (I suppose it was the most<br> losing night of Kirk's life)<br> was just about a year ago,<br> in Beverly Hills, California<br> It was quite a night. Turned<br> out to be quite a party<br> Kirk Edwards was the host<br> and over my objections,<br> Maria let him use her house<br> He'd asked personally<br> and Maria said yes<br> Kirk didn't give many<br> parties, but when he did<br> they were always for men<br> like Seor Alberto Bravano<br> Bravano did no less for Kirk<br> when Kirk visited South America<br> Noblesse oblige, sort of<br> But it soon became obvious<br> that the seor was only mildly<br> interested in the available talent<br> He'd found what he wanted: Maria<br> Jerry and I were playing backgammon<br> That dated us, all right,<br> but it gave us something to do<br> We weren't paying much<br> attention to the game<br> We were worried about Maria<br> She seemed too restless,<br> too tense, too withdrawn<br> And Kirk, when he<br> wasn't looking at Maria<br> he was watching<br> Bravano look at Maria<br> He didn't like it<br> Alberto Bravano was, and is<br> one of the three richest<br> men in South America<br> which makes him one of<br> the richest in the world<br> But unlike Kirk his<br> only interest in money<br> lay in spending it for<br> his own gratification<br> To Oscar, Alberto<br> Bravano was heaven-sent<br> A man with more<br> money than Kirk, even<br> and even more in need of a<br> counsel for public relations<br> It's a form of<br> insurance, you might say<br> Only, instead of your life<br> it protects your good<br> name and your reputation<br> Too late. My name and reputation<br> already are hopelessly bad<br> Mr Muldoon, in my whole life<br> I have made one major decision<br> When I was 15 years<br> old, I had two choices<br> Everybody wanted me<br> to be a good little boy<br> and do good for others<br> I chose to be a bad little<br> boy and do good for myself<br> So far, so good, seor. But the<br> world is getting smaller all the time<br> And if somebody drops a lot of money<br> in a gambling casino<br> in Deauville, France<br> the noise can be heard quite a way.<br> Interesting. And how<br> far, would you say<br> can this falling money be heard?<br> With nobody around to quiet it down<br> the sound could travel all<br> the way to certain mining camps<br> deep in the jungles<br> of South America<br> Camps where the men<br> aren't paid enough<br> or protected against disease enough<br> Interesting<br> And how would such fantastic lies<br> come to the ears of a man<br> such as you, Mr Muldoon?<br> Well, like I say, it's a tiny world<br> If, for instance, somebody rents a<br> whole hotel at Cap d'Antibes, France<br> for the entire season,<br> just to make sure<br> he can have it the<br> last two weeks in August<br> and if somebody else<br> doesn't keep it quiet<br> people might read about it in cafs<br> in certain South American cities<br> Is it not fortunate, for instance<br> that I own the<br> newspapers in my country?<br> Anyone with a printing<br> press in the cellar<br> and something to<br> say owns a newspaper<br> There are laws against propaganda<br> that certain governments<br> enforce very rigidly<br> Is any man rich enough<br> to own a government?<br> I will not answer vaguely,<br> Mr Muldoon. Yes<br> It's a funny thing about<br> the governments one owns<br> If the owner isn't around<br> but is cruising around the<br> Mediterranean on a yacht<br> that costs more to keep up than the<br> combined salaries of his government<br> and nobody is around to<br> protect his interests...<br> What do you think? Will Maria<br> d'Amata come with me to the Riviera?<br> She ought to jump at the chance,<br> but she's a strange girl<br> To have Maria D'Amata<br> as my personal guest<br> would be the best of possible<br> public relations for me, Mr Muldoon<br> Besides, is not Maria D'Amata<br> the chief asset of Kirk Edwards?<br> In what way do you mean?<br> One considers her<br> his prize possession<br> Only if one does not<br> know what the score is<br> You throw double sixes again and<br> I'll have you burned for a witch<br> Sore loser. He owes me<br> $187,000 and he won't pay up<br> - You won't take my cheque<br> - I'll say<br> - Double six<br> - Ouch<br> The last time this<br> witch went to a party<br> she made the princess prick her<br> finger and fall asleep for 100 years<br> Is that some kind<br> of Chinese chequers?<br> - Huh?<br> - Chinese chequers?<br> No, this is... pinochle<br> - I'm drunk<br> - It's just stuffy in here, that's all<br> Oh, no, I'm drunk<br> - Can I ask you something?<br> - Of course<br> - Nice house you got<br> - Thank you<br> - Nice party.<br> - And nice questions you ask<br> Yeah<br> What is with you?<br> What goes with you?<br> I don't understand those questions<br> Maria D'Amata. Great big<br> star. Great big sex number<br> Who is it? If it's not<br> Kirk, who is it? Harry?<br> - Shut up<br> - Is it gonna be Bravano or who?<br> On the screen, you get 'em all.<br> What about off?<br> What about in a room?<br> This room. Name a man<br> Or maybe you're afraid of men<br> All right, blow. And<br> don't forget to call a cab<br> Who's she kiddin'? She hasn't<br> even got what "I've" got<br> What she's got you couldn't spell<br> And what you've got,<br> you used to have<br> Now beat it<br> I don't even believe<br> you're playing pinochle<br> Come on, Maria, let's us<br> go sit upstairs for a while<br> I'd like to talk to Harry<br> for a moment. Would you mind?<br> Of course I wouldn't<br> Where will you be?<br> Right here, practising double sixes<br> Remember all the money I owe you<br> No sweet talk with these juveniles<br> or you won't collect a nickel<br> You know just the right<br> thing to say to a girl<br> at the right time, don't you?<br> I keep forgetting you don't smoke<br> A glamour girl, who<br> does not even smoke<br> I should really be in the<br> circus with the strange people<br> - Freaks<br> - Freaks<br> Harry, I think that I should go home<br> This "is" your home<br> This is an ugly house in<br> bad taste, which I rent<br> Containing a bed to<br> sleep on, which I rent<br> Chairs to sit on and a stove<br> to keep me warm, which I rent<br> Then buy a place of<br> your own, or build one<br> I cannot buy, and working<br> men cannot build a home<br> You've worked hard. Three<br> pictures, one right after another<br> Maybe a rest and a change<br> of scene will do you good<br> Finding me, bringing me here<br> our three films together, has<br> it been good for you, Harry?<br> I've never had it so good<br> Because I think I should go<br> back to Madrid, and stay there<br> I should stay where I belong<br> - Where is that?<br> - In the dirt of the streets<br> - Do you think you could stay there?<br> - Probably not<br> Probably now I would not belong<br> there any more than where I am<br> Where are you, Maria?<br> Half in the dirt and half out<br> Ah. Then it hasn't been good for you<br> Oh, in many ways it's<br> been beyond my dreams<br> Like a fairy tale of this century<br> And I have been "la Cenicienta"<br> Spanish for Cinderella?<br> I have gowns and jewels<br> of silver and gold<br> I have a coach not<br> pulled by four horses<br> but with the power of 200<br> Thousands of men write each<br> month that they dream of me<br> Mothers give my name to their babies<br> And young girls rub their faces<br> with the soap which I am paid<br> to say I use, but which I do not<br> And I have so many other things<br> Everything in the world<br> which can be rented<br> As I remember the story<br> you've left out one<br> very important character<br> I have left out the prince<br> Did it ever occur to you, Harry<br> that the prince looked<br> everywhere for Cinderella<br> just so that he could put<br> the shoe back on her foot?<br> Now that you mention it...<br> I thought you'd sent him away.<br> You asked him to come back<br> Yes, I asked him back<br> Your life is your own. I've<br> never told you how to live it<br> But this one is no good<br> No worse, no better than the others.<br> You cannot rent a prince<br> I've seen him. He's<br> mean and he's dirty<br> And which of the men<br> inside this house is not?<br> Who? Name him for me, Harry<br> You cast your films so well<br> Which of them would you<br> have play the prince?<br> All the men are not in this house<br> and what you need<br> is not in that house<br> All your talk about<br> a frightened child<br> finding love and<br> security in the dirt<br> All children love<br> dirt, but they grow up<br> The fairy tale again<br> Cinderella came out of the ashes<br> and was spotless when<br> the prince came along<br> Maria<br> most women in this world<br> pray and cry in their sleep<br> for just one small<br> part of what you've got<br> so that they can find what all<br> women need, what "you" need, Maria<br> A man you can look at in the daytime<br> A man you can love like a woman<br> have children by, grow old with<br> share joys and sorrows,<br> success and failure<br> You've got to make up your mind<br> Half in the dirt and half<br> out... Go one way or the other<br> But if you go back, what<br> a pitiful waste it'll be<br> And if I go the other<br> way, I go to what?<br> To a big white yacht<br> with Alberto Bravano?<br> Just because it is big and white<br> and a yacht, is it not still dirt?<br> Do not think that I do not agree<br> with everything you say, Harry<br> But I... I cannot help myself<br> One thing you can't knock<br> about Southern California,<br> the air at night<br> I sure pity the people who<br> have to breathe in the daytime<br> You got somethin' on your mind?<br> Not a thing, Oscar. How about you?<br> I was just wonderin'<br> You look like you had a<br> sneak preview playin' inside<br> I've been wondering too.<br> You can't see Kirk<br> Suppose he has a cigarette<br> in his mouth and needs a light<br> Maybe he should<br> carry his own matches<br> - Oh? Am I the first to know?<br> - Know what?<br> Oh, you're going to love<br> international caf society<br> No more plain Morocco/Stork<br> Club caf society for you<br> No bums in black ties. It's<br> bums in white ties from now on<br> I thought you were on the wagon<br> Oscar, this is Harry<br> - How about Bravano? Got him hooked?<br> - All but the clincher<br> I got him sold, Harry. I know it<br> I got that gaucho seeing himself<br> up there with the Rockefellers<br> It's the deal of my lifetime,<br> if I can just find that clincher<br> Hurry, hurry, hurry!<br> See the battle of the giants<br> - What?<br> - Kirk and Bravano are having it out<br> - A fight?<br> - Goliath versus Goliath<br> - Throwin' punches?<br> - Don't be silly<br> Neither one of them<br> has had his hands closed<br> since the day he was born<br> My tongue is loosened by champagne<br> I speak as I do everything,<br> for all the world to know<br> Everything I do - and I admit to all<br> your accusations - I do in the open<br> But you, Mr Kirk<br> Edwards, do them secretly<br> - Do you deny that?<br> - You're a liar. You're a liar!<br> You repeat yourself<br> Take a drink, my friend, and<br> say what you have in your heart<br> But you never drink. You never say<br> Is it because you fear<br> what's in your heart?<br> - You're a liar<br> - Granted. But so are you, Mr Edwards<br> You are everything that I am, plus<br> one more sin: Hypocrisy, my friend<br> You pretend not to be what<br> you are, not to do what you do<br> This is most evil of all<br> You've never done an honest<br> day's work in your life<br> I have never done a<br> day's work in my life<br> honest or dishonest,<br> but neither have you<br> To make $100 into $110, this is work<br> To make 100 million into<br> 110 million, this is inevitable<br> At least I keep my<br> money in my own country<br> and spend it here and pay my taxes<br> I keep my money in your country too<br> and for the same reason<br> as you. It is safest here<br> And as for taxes, how<br> many millions have you<br> in tax-exempt bonds and oil wells<br> whose power of production<br> your government protects<br> while it denies such<br> benefits to the brain?<br> What about "your" flea-bitten<br> country? What taxes do you pay?<br> It is a well-known<br> fact that everywhere<br> except for the British<br> Empire and the USA<br> the income tax can be easily avoided<br> by anyone with income. I pay none<br> Then what right do you have to<br> attack the American way of life?<br> Oh, please, Mr Kirk Edwards<br> I attack nothing and<br> nobody but you, personally<br> I've never met an American<br> to whom the American way<br> of life was not his own<br> But it is only yours I attack<br> My life is none of your business.<br> I live it my way and I like it<br> Then why does it not make you happy?<br> Do you not agree<br> to have an enormous amount<br> of money is a wonderful thing?<br> Why don't you shut up and<br> go back where you came from<br> Oh, this is unworthy, even from you<br> Next you will tell me the best<br> friend of a boy is his mother<br> - Mine was - Obviously.<br> And that of a man, his horse<br> It is not clear to me<br> when the transition from<br> mother to horse takes place<br> - Get out of here, Bravano<br> - I will go when I please<br> - I'll have you thrown out!<br> - I will offer no resistance<br> I am a physical coward. So<br> are you. But I admit it openly<br> I'm a selfish man, not a good<br> man. But I admit it openly<br> I enjoy to live. You do not<br> I waste my money with pleasure.<br> But yours is just a waste<br> I will not go back where I came<br> from because I do not like it there<br> You are incapable of liking it<br> anywhere, so you stay where you are<br> Goodbye, Mr Kirk Edwards<br> Are you coming with me?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - I leave tomorrow morning for Cannes<br> I invited you to join my yachting<br> party and you said you'd let me know<br> I ask you now, openly<br> It would delight me if<br> you would come with me<br> this minute, out of this house<br> You must be confused, seor.<br> This is my house. I live here<br> - Then tomorrow morning<br> - Maria!<br> Tell him you're not going,<br> tomorrow morning or ever<br> Always, Kirk, you choose<br> exactly the wrong moment<br> to play dictator with me<br> I forbid you to go with him!<br> And I want to hear you tell him so<br> Too bad. I had decided not to go<br> Now I think I must<br> I will come for you tomorrow morning<br> Oscar<br> Clear everybody<br> out. The party's over<br> This is your clincher,<br> Muldoon. Don't blow it<br> Just this once, Kirk, why don't<br> you empty your own ashtrays?<br> - You heard what I said?<br> - You said the party's over<br> Tell everybody to go home<br> The party's over<br> and I want to thank<br> you for a lovely evening<br> How drunk are you, Muldoon?<br> I've warned you about<br> getting too drunk<br> For four years<br> - and now it's over -<br> for four years I've<br> invited the guests<br> and provided the entertainment<br> and cleaned up the dirt and paid<br> off the waiters and paid off the cops<br> and paid off the papers<br> and paid off the guests<br> And now it's good<br> night. The party's over<br> I've had a lovely evening,<br> but I must be going<br> You're fired, as of right now<br> Don't call me, I'll call you<br> Bravo, Mr Muldoon<br> Mr Muldoon, it would<br> delight me almost as much<br> if you were to come with me<br> this minute, out of this house<br> Seor, I think you've<br> got yourself a deal<br> - She'll never make another picture<br> - How are you going to stop her?<br> Withdraw your financing and release?<br> It's late, but I'm sure MGM,<br> Fox, Paramount and the rest<br> will be happy to have me<br> wake them up with the news<br> I'll fight it for years...<br> to the Supreme Court<br> I'll keep her off<br> the screen, I'll destroy her<br> Nah, she's too big now<br> Oscar. I'll destroy Oscar<br> He knows too much<br> and where to tell it<br> Why not destroy Seor Bravano?<br> All those hundreds of millions of<br> dollars, crashing against each other<br> like a couple of big elks<br> with your horns locked<br> battling till you both<br> starve to death in the snow<br> You<br> Not even me. Not any more<br> Myrna<br> I'll drive you home<br> Don't I remember you from somewhere?<br> Maybe we'll fly to Las Vegas<br> I'll get my coat.<br> I'll meet you in the car<br> Harry, remember how you used<br> to say life wrote lousy scripts?<br> Even in one of yours I would<br> have thrown this glass at him<br> I'm going home with him instead<br> You want to know the (what<br> do you call it) motivation?<br> Easy<br> I'm a frightened tramp<br> - Where's your coat?<br> - In the car<br> - Where'd you park it?<br> - Driveway. We'll go around the back<br> Harry, look<br> They're Maria's<br> She was wearing them tonight<br> Cinderella's slippers<br> Who lives in the little<br> house? The prince?<br> - Cinderella's cousin<br> - I don't understand that<br> I'll tell you about it in the car<br> I didn't tell her, of<br> course. Not even Jerry<br> Some things you just<br> don't tell anybody<br> If it would have helped, I'd<br> have yelled it in the streets<br> But nothing could have helped<br> The moving finger had<br> already writ and moved on<br> And nothing I could do would<br> have cancelled half a line<br> Nor would my tears<br> wash out a word of it<br> If this paisan asks me again<br> am I sure the cameraman got his<br> picture coming to this funeral...<br> It's the only reason he's here<br> Ah, well. It's my own fault<br> I talked him into coming.<br> It's basic public relations<br> If people see the<br> biggest rat in the world<br> walk with his hat<br> off behind a casket<br> he becomes a lovable codger<br> Bravano practically<br> climbed into the coffin<br> to be sure they took his picture<br> At that, I assure you he got as close<br> to Maria dead as he did to her alive<br> He and Kirk, they both got nowhere<br> Only difference was<br> Kirk wouldn't quit till he<br> tried everything in the book<br> On the other hand,<br> Bravano quit like a dog<br> practically the first<br> time Maria said no<br> It seems to me he<br> was secretly relieved<br> The important thing to Bravano<br> was for people to<br> think Maria was his girl<br> as long as he got credit for it<br> If Bravano had to choose between<br> really having Maria, in secret<br> and not having her, but with<br> the whole world thinking he did<br> he'd want it just he way it was<br> This I cannot figure<br> This doesn't mean it can't be figured<br> You could fill a big, fat book<br> with what I haven't been<br> able to figure since I was 12<br> Maria, for instance, I could<br> never figure. But then, who could?<br> There she was, the world's<br> number one symbol of desirability<br> on display all over the<br> world's number one showroom<br> with the world's number<br> one customers wanting to buy<br> and nobody wrapped her<br> up and took her home<br> Nobody<br> I'll swear that into my own grave<br> Nobody<br> And while I'm on the broad<br> subject of what I can't figure<br> I give you that phenomenon<br> of this day and age called<br> "the international set"<br> Once a year, on the French Riviera<br> one of the most beautiful<br> seashores on God's earth<br> the international set gathers<br> the way an annual fungus<br> gathers on a beautiful tree<br> It's quite a set<br> It's as if ordinary human<br> beings, living ordinary lives<br> had suddenly vanished from the earth<br> and the world was suddenly full<br> of butterflies shaped like people<br> They are all happy, all the time<br> Some of them are happy<br> because they are beautiful<br> And some of them have to be happy<br> because they are nothing but rich<br> Some of the international set<br> are happy because they are dogs<br> Don't laugh. There's a<br> beauty parlour in Cannes...<br> just for dogs<br> But the happiest of the<br> international butterflies<br> are those who live as if<br> they never left the cocoon<br> They form in little groups<br> usually around some<br> piece of ex-royalty<br> Bravano, of course, had the<br> best cocoon that money could buy<br> To begin with, he had as his<br> guest for the entire season<br> the pretender to the throne<br> The name of the<br> throne doesn't matter<br> But, in the world of pretence<br> a pretender is the<br> best thing you can be<br> So, to the international<br> set, he was a king<br> His wife was English.<br> She was a commoner<br> And they don't come any commoner<br> But together they ruled the Riviera<br> by permission of the<br> copyright holder, Lulu McGee<br> Lulu McGee runs the<br> international set<br> She never asks for<br> money but, somehow<br> she always happens to<br> help grateful rich people<br> Hector Eubanks was the<br> fireball of our little cocoon<br> Oil hit Hector one fine day, and<br> he just never came out from under it<br> There was also Mrs Hector Eubanks<br> She was a joint income-tax return<br> And in the middle of all this<br> fantastic unreality was Maria...<br> more unreal, in a<br> way, than any of it<br> She moved among all<br> these crazy people<br> through the casinos and beaches<br> and brawls, from Marseille to Monaco<br> as if she were loaded with Novocaine<br> She showed no pain, no<br> pleasure, no interest, no nothing<br> You figure it. I can't<br> Any more than I could on that<br> night I saw Maria for the last time<br> It was at one of the<br> casinos, kind of late<br> We'd finished dinner hours ago<br> Bravano and Hector Eubanks<br> were inside, gambling<br> I assumed Maria was with Bravano<br> The rest of us had<br> run out of conversation<br> The rest of us had<br> run out of conversation<br> After all, we hadn't sen<br> each other since cocktails<br> and we hadn't eaten<br> together since lunch<br> Lulu was trying to work<br> up interest in a word game<br> It's not easy with people<br> who know just enough words<br> to tell room service what they want<br> It's really very<br> simple, Your Highness<br> You write the long<br> word on top of the page<br> and under it, you write<br> all of the short words<br> you can make out of the long one<br> Oh<br> For the long word,<br> let's use "vicissitudes"<br> Is that actually a word?<br> V- i-c-i-s-s-i-t-u-d-e-s<br> It's changes, fluctuations,<br> like the vicissitudes of life<br> How clever of you, my dear<br> J'ai besoin de champagne<br> Did you say<br> something, Your Majesty?<br> - I shall require more champagne<br> - "Mais certainement. " Oscar<br> - More of the same for the king<br> - Yes, sir<br> What news from the gaming table?<br> Very good. Alberto is<br> having a fantastic bank<br> It's about time<br> Last night that Greek took him<br> for a whole South American jungle<br> You know something? Off the screen<br> I don't think I've<br> seen you laugh before<br> I feel very good tonight<br> Every night's like every other night<br> - No, not tonight<br> - What's different?<br> I don't know. Something<br> in the way my heart beats<br> As if something very good were<br> going to come out of tonight<br> Something's coming tonight, all<br> right, but it's not good. He's mad<br> I've seen him like this before<br> He's half-crazy when<br> he gets like this<br> How do I find the words<br> to tell you what you are?<br> To begin with, a thief. You took<br> money from me when I was playing<br> When I was winning.<br> It changed my luck<br> You have cost me millions<br> and millions of francs<br> You put a curse on me,<br> not only for tonight<br> but from the unhappy moment<br> I knew of your existence<br> As you will put a curse always on<br> everyone and everything near to you<br> - Maybe you can talk this over<br> in private - Let him, Oscar<br> Next, you are not a woman<br> I do not know what you<br> are, but you are not a woman<br> You will not let yourself<br> be loved. You cannot love<br> Once, you had the look<br> for me of an exquisite lady<br> Now I do not see that look<br> I only see that you have<br> the body of an animal<br> A dead animal<br> I have paid for your company and<br> you will come and go as I tell you<br> Monsieur. Permit me<br> - Is the gigolo known to anyone?<br> - He is known to me<br> His name is Vincenzo,<br> Conte Torlato-Favrini<br> He is not a gigolo<br> He is less a gigolo than<br> anyone in our immediate company<br> Surely less than anyone you will<br> ever have the good fortune to meet<br> He certainly acts high<br> and mighty for just a count<br> My dear Lulu, there<br> are counts and counts<br> just as there are kings and kings<br> Among the counts,<br> Torlato-Favrini is a king<br> Just as among the<br> kings, I am a clown<br> I am puzzled only by his<br> presence in a place like this<br> among people like us<br> My champagne is not properly cooled<br> Alberto, do you happen to know<br> the Marquise de Baudenire?<br> A really distinguished family...<br> And that was the last I<br> ever saw of Maria Vargas<br> whom the world knew as Maria D'Amata<br> but who died as the<br> Contessa Torlato-Favrini<br> Che sar, sar.<br> What will be, will be<br> An ancient and<br> unimaginative Italian proverb<br> It has been the motto of my<br> house for more than 450 years<br> And it is only fitting perhaps<br> that as the House of<br> Torlato-Favrini comes to its end<br> our motto will never<br> be more to the point<br> What will be, will be<br> An easy generality. A universal cure<br> I am what I am, do what I<br> do, and cannot help myself<br> Therefore, I am free of my guilt<br> Nonsense, of course<br> Yet, I can suggest no other<br> answer, if there must be an answer<br> to how and why it began<br> between Maria and me<br> I was driving, as I had for<br> countless times before that time<br> I was driving somewhere, anywhere<br> just to be away from the restlessness<br> of nights after nights without sleep<br> and the empty dawns<br> that followed them<br> But why, of all the somewheres<br> and anywheres in the world<br> should I, that time, have crossed<br> the border from Italy to France?<br> Of all directions, why<br> should I have chosen one<br> leading to that parade<br> ground of vulgarity<br> which lies between Nice and Cannes?<br> Che sar, sar<br> She looked at me for no<br> longer than the beat of a heart<br> and I knew I would remember<br> her as long as I lived<br> That was my meeting with Maria<br> It occurs to me just now that,<br> oddly, we have never talked about it<br> But no more odd, surely,<br> than my driving away that day<br> away from her, knowing that<br> inevitably, we would meet again<br> And it was late that night in,<br> of all places, a gambling casino<br> when I saw Maria again<br> To begin with, a thief. You took<br> money from me when I was playing<br> When I was winning.<br> It changed my luck<br> You have cost me millions<br> and millions of francs<br> You put a curse on me,<br> not only for tonight<br> but from the unhappy moment<br> I knew you existed<br> As you will put a curse<br> always on everyone near to you<br> - Maybe you can talk this over<br> in private - Let him, Oscar<br> Next, you are not a woman<br> I do not know what you are,<br> but you are not a woman<br> You will not let yourself<br> be loved. You cannot love<br> Once, you had the look<br> for me of an exquisite lady<br> Now I do not see that look<br> I see only that you have<br> the body of an animal<br> A dead animal<br> I have paid for your company and<br> you will come and go as I tell you<br> Monsieur. Permit me<br> I cannot remember much of<br> that shabby little scene<br> except for some cheap<br> heroics on my part<br> But I do remember that Maria<br> seemed unsurprised at my being there<br> That she left with me without question<br> As if she had been waiting for me<br> Thank you. I do not smoke<br> What is your name?<br> Maria Vargas<br> Are you Spanish?<br> But I live in America. I work there<br> What is your work? Are you<br> a professional entertainer?<br> In a way. Perhaps not in<br> the way that you think<br> You have no way of knowing<br> the way that I think<br> Where are we going?<br> First, to your hotel,<br> so that you can pack<br> - And then? - To Rapallo.<br> Do you know where it is?<br> In Italy<br> - Why to Rapallo?<br> - I live there<br> And did you drive here<br> today from Rapallo?<br> - Mm-hm<br> - Why?<br> To bring you back with me<br> Oh, I think not<br> My name is Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini<br> And what are you doing here...<br> besides having come for me?<br> There is no other reason<br> Tell me, do you see many movies?<br> Oh, very few. A good foreign film<br> now and then... American or English<br> Then perhaps you read<br> many cheap novels?<br> I understand<br> You would be justified<br> in asking also<br> whether I am addicted to narcotics<br> I have told you the complete truth<br> - You have never seen me<br> before today? - Never<br> - But you have known about me?<br> - No<br> Then you left Rapallo to find<br> and to bring back someone you<br> had never seen or heard about?<br> No. I left my home simply<br> because I had to leave<br> It has happened many times before<br> There is, perhaps,<br> an explanation for it<br> But I will not attempt<br> one here and now<br> When did you know that<br> you had come for me?<br> When you knew, too<br> For the first time, when we looked<br> at each other in the Gypsy camp<br> and again at the window of the casino<br> and again, just now, when<br> I held out my hand to you<br> You knew, as well as I.<br> It won't take me long to pack<br> Torlatos, Favrinis, and Torlato-Favrinis<br> When my sister and I are extinct<br> perhaps they will name<br> automobiles after us<br> The Torlatos and the Favrinis<br> will be speedy little cars<br> and the Torlato-Favrini<br> a limousine, of course<br> This was Beatrice Favrini<br> How strange, to be painted<br> with a little boy and a sword<br> The little boy was her son.<br> The sword was her husband's<br> It was brought to<br> her when he was killed<br> in a stupid war<br> between Italian cities<br> My own husband was<br> killed in this last war<br> I have neither his<br> child nor his sword<br> He was blown up at sea. I<br> do not have even his cadaver<br> Eleonora...<br> But perhaps you should<br> tell the story, Vincenzo<br> of a "happy" ancestor<br> - Francesco the Fat, for instance<br> - Francesco can wait<br> I have the honour to<br> present Benvenuto Torlato<br> You have a resemblance to him<br> Thank you. I'm proud<br> of the coincidence<br> I admire this gentleman<br> He was one of Cesare Borgia's<br> most trusted assassins<br> He was stabbed to death<br> and thrown into the Arno<br> - Then what do you admire about him?<br> - His foresight<br> He adopted the motto of<br> our house. "Che sar, sar"<br> He knew what it<br> would be like with us<br> It has occurred to you, of course,<br> that I intend to marry Maria?<br> - It has occurred to me<br> - Do you approve?<br> - Have you told her?<br> - Not yet<br> She has been waiting to be told<br> I believe the proper word in<br> connection with marriage is "ask"<br> You keep saying "told"<br> I know Maria very little<br> but I've known for weeks<br> that she is in love with you<br> Do you approve?<br> It is almost frightening, how<br> much in love with you she is<br> - Then you don't approve<br> - Why do you ask me at all?<br> Because you want me to tell<br> you what you already know?<br> That to marry Maria<br> would be the most...<br> cruel and destructive<br> thing you'll ever have done?<br> As for destruction, we have<br> already been destroyed, you and I<br> We have come to the end of our line<br> Literally, to the end of the line<br> It is time for the Torlato-Favrinis<br> to get off the world<br> The fact remains that we are neither<br> unique nor important to the world<br> and it will go on without us<br> How will we be remembered, I wonder?<br> Why should we be remembered at all?<br> Nobility - the kind that continues<br> just because it continues to exist -<br> is becoming extinct<br> But why?<br> Because the world has<br> become a changed place<br> And, like the dinosaurs, we<br> can no longer function in it<br> Perhaps that's why I'm<br> incapable of having a child<br> Perhaps that's why you...<br> We cannot have come this<br> far to leave nothing behind<br> but some undistinguished,<br> unidentifiable portraits<br> to be hung on the back<br> walls of curiosity shops<br> to gather the dust of the future<br> Come here, Eleonora<br> The last contessa<br> The world will some day see<br> paintings of her, and of her and me<br> and then it will think:<br> "What a pity they have gone<br> and left nothing behind"<br> We will be remembered<br> Because the last<br> contessa was a movie star?<br> Vincenzo, you cannot marry a woman<br> as if you were putting on a play<br> because she's the type you've in<br> mind, because she's perfectly cast<br> as a portrait of the last<br> Contessa Torlato-Favrini<br> Maria is a living woman,<br> too much in love with you<br> Have you thought for<br> a moment about her?<br> Have you thought about<br> anybody else but yourself<br> and your obsession with<br> 14 letters of the alphabet<br> arranged in a hyphenated name?<br> Thought about anybody else?<br> Yes. Yes, Eleonora, I have<br> About everybody else, it seems to me<br> I have thought about<br> every individual living man<br> woman and child in the<br> world, it seems to me<br> I've had the time for it, you know?<br> Since the 25th October<br> 1942, to be exact<br> It's a lot of time<br> Especially when it stands<br> still with loneliness<br> Especially when it<br> has no days and nights<br> but just days that turn<br> black when the sun goes down<br> It's a lot of time<br> Especially when there<br> is nothing to think of<br> but all the living men, women<br> and children in the world<br> And nothing to do but<br> to think about them<br> And no way to forget<br> that I am none of them<br> Perhaps I have<br> become, as you put it<br> obsessed by our name and our past<br> and the absence of our<br> future, and by our paintings<br> As if, in some magical way<br> our long line of paintings<br> will accomplish what we cannot<br> I hadn't wanted this<br> It has happened to<br> me without my wanting<br> almost without my knowing<br> You are quite right, and<br> I do not have the right<br> But I do love Maria<br> The bride on whom<br> the rain doth fall<br> I read the official announcement in<br> the ship's newspaper I'm a way over<br> about six months ago<br> That Maria D'Amata was going<br> to marry Count Torlato-Favrini<br> The gossip columns had<br> been full of rumours<br> Mostly the kind of angry<br> insinuations they write<br> when nobody's really got the story<br> They even got on me, figuring<br> I knew more than I was telling<br> They were right. I'd had<br> many letters from Maria<br> What I knew was that the prince<br> had finally caught<br> up with Cinderella<br> and that nothing remained<br> but the slipper business<br> and a happy life ever after<br> Maria was trousseau-shopping<br> in Rome when I got here<br> So I went to work<br> Maria!<br> - Eddie?<br> - Yeah, boss?<br> You and Jack keep lookin' for that<br> alley. I'll see you back at the hotel<br> - Well<br> - Well<br> - How's Jerry?<br> - Jerry's fine. Sends her love<br> - You look fine<br> - I feel fine<br> Well?<br> Well<br> I'm behaving like...<br> like 13 years old<br> Don't kid yourself. You<br> look 14 if you look a day<br> Where do you want to begin?<br> There was no beginning<br> As if all my life I had<br> lived in a dark place...<br> and all at once the lights went on<br> That's the way it<br> happens in fairy tales<br> Are you still bewitched?<br> And bewildered?<br> No. Never in my life have<br> I been more sure of myself<br> and of everything else<br> - Tell me about him<br> - How can I? What would I tell you?<br> That he is handsome and tall, and<br> good and kind, and proud and so on?<br> This is how the hero is described<br> in the chip magazines one<br> reads at the hairdresser<br> Then what is "he"<br> that the hero is not?<br> This is what I do not<br> know how to tell you<br> For instance?<br> I say I cannot tell you<br> and you say "Tell it"<br> Harry the director: I say I cannot<br> play a scene and you say "Play it"<br> And you do. So, for instance?<br> It would sound silly even to try<br> but perhaps not to you<br> Harry, you won't laugh<br> but it is really like in the story<br> of "la Cenicienta" and the prince<br> - What is?<br> - Everything<br> Even when we're alone together<br> - How do you mean that?<br> - And now you will laugh<br> - He kisses my hand<br> - That figures. Standard opening<br> - And now you are being<br> deliberately stupid - No, I'm...<br> Oh! So he kisses<br> your hand, and period<br> - Is that all right with you?<br> - No, of course... Yes<br> - As it should be with a contessa<br> - In a fairy tale<br> How long's it been<br> since you've known him?<br> Almost six weeks<br> Six weeks of being<br> near you day and night<br> Sometimes he holds me with<br> his two hands, like this<br> and just looks at me<br> Are you sure he can see you?<br> He sees more than any man I have<br> ever known. Except perhaps you<br> I'm not seeing much of<br> anything at the moment<br> I told you. He is<br> what other men are not<br> That seems obvious. It also<br> seems obvious that maybe<br> we're carrying this<br> fairy-tale nonsense<br> a little too far...<br> right smack into reality<br> I don't want this<br> to be a shock to you<br> but a count is a man<br> and a contessa is a woman<br> - You had better see for yourself<br> - No, I want to hear more about this<br> No. I have a sitting and I'm late<br> Looking back, I probably wasn't as<br> worried then as I now think I was<br> But I do know that I was<br> filled with a sudden uneasiness<br> Good afternoon<br> Cominciamo<br> Well, Harry? Say something<br> Wait till they hear about<br> this in Southern California<br> In six months<br> Beverly Hills will have more<br> statues than orange trees<br> - Where does it go?<br> - Right where it is<br> Although, due to a whim of Maria<br> it will be more at<br> home in our garden<br> As you can see, she has insisted<br> upon posing with bare feet<br> Have I failed to understand<br> something amusing?<br> It's a private joke. A stupid one<br> that can't be explained and make sense<br> Signor Trilli would appreciate<br> having Maria to himself<br> without distractions, I think<br> I know exactly how he feels<br> The hardest thing in the world<br> is getting an actor to stand still<br> Won't you change your mind<br> and stay for dinner, Mr Dawes?<br> No, unhappily I can't<br> We're off location-hunting in<br> the morning and have work tonight<br> I'm overdue right<br> now, as matter of fact<br> Maria seems so<br> happy to have you here<br> I do hope you won't<br> return to America too soon<br> It'll be quite a while<br> We will see you<br> before then, I am sure<br> But I know that Maria will<br> want you to be at our wedding<br> Oh, haven't you heard?<br> I'm giving the bride away<br> And I did give her away<br> In an ancient chapel<br> witnessed by a handful of strangers<br> I gave the hand of Maria Vargas<br> into that of Vincenzo,<br> Count Torlato-Favrini<br> The servants had their own<br> party, after the wedding<br> Nobody can tell me it was like<br> that when the Borgias got married...<br> more going on outside<br> the palazzo than inside<br> Anyway, there were two receptions<br> And, knowing the bride as I did<br> I could tell she felt she'd<br> come to the wrong reception<br> The accordion player<br> is the gardener's son<br> The guitar is the gardener<br> - I do not know who plays the violin<br> - Paganini. He's the pastry cook<br> They must have more<br> guests than we have<br> That's as it should be.<br> Aristocracy only started to collapse<br> when there were more<br> aristocrats than servants<br> - And they're having more fun<br> - That they are<br> On my wedding night, Harry<br> I thought you would be happier<br> for me than you seem to be<br> Are you happy? Well, then I'm happy<br> It's just different from<br> what I'd pictured. I...<br> I had something corny in mind<br> Like dancing at your wedding.<br> Real bashful-boy stuff<br> Then come dance with me, out there.<br> We belong out there anyway<br> Maybe I do. But not you.<br> Not any more, contessa<br> Vincenzo, would you object<br> to dancing with me out there?<br> I would not object to<br> anything you wanted to do<br> but I don't think you'd<br> want to spoil their fun<br> But they are celebrating our<br> wedding. Don't they expect us?<br> I imagine they are<br> afraid we might turn up<br> It's hard to believe,<br> in this day and age<br> What makes you think we<br> live in this day and age?<br> Well, the time has come<br> Bedtime for children under<br> 12 and movie directors<br> I'll see you out<br> In case I wasn't<br> heard above the hubbub<br> - once more, I congratulate you<br> - Thank you<br> - And me<br> - And you<br> Oh, uh... I've got to say something.<br> I hope you won't mind<br> I won't know until<br> after you've said it<br> My relationship with Maria...<br> It's been a strange one. I've<br> never known what it was, really<br> Friend, director, confessor,<br> part-time amateur psychiatrist...<br> And, as of now, father of the bride?<br> As of now, more like a godfather<br> A fairy godfather,<br> with a sense of reality<br> No one could wish for anything more<br> She's lived her whole life<br> as a fairy tale, you know?<br> No, I did not know<br> She's never been in love before.<br> Take my word for it.<br> She's vulnerable. Wide<br> open to be hurt badly<br> Emotionally, she's a child<br> And she's wrapped all her dreams up<br> in one dream prince, and you're it<br> That's quite a responsibility<br> I don't want her hurt badly.<br> I don't want her hurt at all<br> Do you think I do? I don't mind<br> what you have said, Mr Dawes<br> But I wonder why did you<br> find it necessary to say<br> Oh, I don't know. My sense<br> number six again, maybe<br> - Number six?<br> - Another private joke. Good night<br> Good night<br> I have seen you like<br> this once or twice before<br> When your characters do not<br> work out as you have planned<br> or have taken a step themselves<br> and you're not sure<br> what the next will be<br> Let's not talk<br> about my script now<br> I'm not. You know<br> I'm talking about me<br> - It's not going to be easy<br> - Has it been, up till now?<br> - Good luck, contessa<br> - Don't you call me that<br> - I forget the Spanish for Cinderella<br> - Nor that<br> Some relationship we have!<br> Three pictures together<br> and not even a nickname<br> What is not going to be easy?<br> I wish I knew. I wish I knew<br> I saw her just once more<br> after that wedding night<br> Twice, really<br> But the second time, she was dead<br> The first time was<br> exactly a week ago<br> It rained all that<br> day and all that night<br> It hasn't stopped since,<br> come to think of it<br> I was holed up at my hotel<br> doing some last-minute rewriting<br> Avanti<br> - Just because you're a contessa...<br> - Are you happy to see me?<br> doesn't give you the right<br> to walk out of my life<br> and then walk right back in<br> any rainy night you feel like it<br> - I was just looking<br> - There isn't much to see<br> I'd like to decide for myself<br> For a contessa who doesn't<br> drink... That's Cognac<br> I know<br> - How was your trip?<br> - You mean my... honeymoon?<br> Whatever you were going on<br> the morning after your wedding<br> I don't want my honeymoon to<br> be called a trip. It was fine<br> You've been away all this time?<br> How much time has it been?<br> I've never known a bride<br> who couldn't tell you almost to the<br> minute, for the first year or so<br> Thirteen weeks, three days...<br> seven hours and twelve minutes<br> No, I've not been away all that time<br> We've been home for ten weeks<br> Nice of you to drop in.<br> Just passing by, I imagine<br> You don't have to hide. It's just me<br> I have to. I can't look at you<br> Now, you didn't drive here in<br> a rainstorm "not" to look at me<br> I'm on your side, remember?<br> Harry...<br> At any rate, this<br> is what I have known<br> I have known what it<br> is like to be in love<br> To be married in a church<br> to a man that I love<br> And on my wedding night to wait<br> for him, with my heart full of love<br> I have loved you all of my life<br> This is why I have never been<br> able to love anyone else before you<br> You have been unreal<br> to me for so long<br> it is hard to believe<br> that all of this<br> is not something I<br> dreamed a long time ago<br> - Is it true that you love me?<br> - I do love you<br> Maria...<br> there are things that<br> must be said sometimes...<br> for which there are no words<br> Or at least no way to say them<br> so that they are not<br> ugly and full of pain<br> You find it hard to believe<br> that this is not just a dream<br> you dreamed long time ago<br> It might very well be just that<br> Almost everything<br> that has to do with us<br> has been dreamlike up to now<br> How we met and why we met<br> Our understanding, without<br> question and without surprise<br> that we were never to be apart again<br> How much more like a<br> dream can a dream be?<br> But inevitably there<br> comes a time for waking up<br> even for us<br> A time for facing<br> the pain and ugliness<br> that can be kept out of<br> dreams but not out of reality<br> It is important that you believe<br> everything I say to you now<br> I love you with all of my heart<br> Do you believe me?<br> You are everything I<br> would want as my wife<br> I would want no one else.<br> I am proud of you<br> I want to make you as happy<br> as I can, as long as I live<br> As for the rest of<br> what I have to say<br> you will find it neatly typed, at<br> some length, on this piece of paper<br> Would it not be<br> better if you told me?<br> No<br> It looks like an army<br> document of some kind<br> It is in Italian, and<br> I do not understand<br> Che sar, sar<br> That is also Italian<br> Apparently, I am not<br> to be let off anything<br> Yes, it is an army document<br> A medical report,<br> dated October 25th 1942<br> from a base hospital in Benghazi<br> It describes in detail<br> the degree to which my body<br> was blown apart by an explosion<br> And, with understandable pride<br> the skill with which they<br> put some of it together again<br> Do you understand now why<br> it is so important to me<br> for you to believe that I<br> love you with all of my heart?<br> The report will tell you that almost<br> the only undestroyed part of me...<br> is my heart<br> I love you with all of it<br> So that was it<br> What?<br> Nothing<br> Tell me, how long<br> could you stand it?<br> What do you mean?<br> How long could you stand it?!<br> - As long as I could<br> - And who's the lucky peasant?<br> The gardener, the<br> chauffeur, the stable boy?<br> Who's the contessa's<br> cousin this week?<br> - Harry, I couldn't help myself<br> - Neither could he!<br> That's the unholy pity of it<br> The one man in all of your fantasy<br> and the one woman in all of his<br> who could have made each other happy<br> And, once more, life<br> louses up the script<br> But I will make him happy<br> Look, will he let<br> you go back to work?<br> I can wind this one up in six weeks.<br> You can take him to California<br> You weren't listening to me.<br> I'm going to make him happy<br> How? How are you going<br> to make him happy?<br> By more of the same,<br> until you get caught?<br> - I don't want to get angry with you<br> - Then why tell me about it?<br> Because I needed to tell you<br> Harry, what do you think<br> would make Vincenzo happy?<br> You, as the perfect, beyond<br> reproach, last contessa<br> That would only<br> make him less unhappy<br> What he would wish for more<br> than anything else in the world<br> is that neither he, nor his<br> sister, nor I be the last<br> - As a wish<br> - It will come true<br> What are you talking about?<br> - I have made it come true<br> - You what?<br> What has happened to your<br> sense number six, Harry?<br> - Who knows?<br> - Only you and I<br> - What about the father?<br> - It is not his concern<br> The baby will be<br> mine and my husband's<br> - Do you really believe that?<br> - It will make Vincenzo happy<br> Maria, don't you know the<br> man you are married to?<br> You're talking mawkish nonsense<br> you remember from cheap films<br> Your husband is not out of James<br> M Barrie or Hans Christian Andersen<br> He's a tortured, neurotic man,<br> who's finishing life on his own terms<br> No, Harry. This time it is<br> you who does not understand<br> I know Vincenzo better than you do<br> Amen to that<br> How much simpler it would be,<br> for so many of us<br> if Kirk Edwards had not found it<br> necessary to look for a new face<br> May I help you in any way?<br> - Who's going to tell him about it?<br> - I am, of course<br> - When?<br> - Tomorrow<br> - It will be difficult for me<br> - Suppose he doesn't see it your way<br> - What will you do?<br> - What every other woman would do<br> - I will have my baby<br> - What about... whoever he is?<br> That is all over. I'm going<br> to tell him now. Tonight<br> That will not be difficult at all<br> She's dead, Mr Dawes... and so is he<br> I have known for some<br> time that there was someone<br> It may be a questionable compliment<br> but I did not suspect you, even<br> though Maria visited you tonight<br> What did she tell you?<br> What did she say to you?<br> She just wanted to talk...<br> about old times<br> For a skilful writer, Mr Dawes,<br> you are an incredibly clumsy liar<br> Did Maria have a chance<br> to say anything before...<br> No. What could she<br> have had to say to me?<br> Not a thing<br> There is no need for you to stay,<br> Mr Dawes. I've sent for the police<br> It may be embarrassing for you<br> I'll hang around<br> - Do you know any Spanish?<br> - Very little<br> The Spanish word for... Cinderella?<br> I've been told a dozen times<br> Just a word I keep forgetting<br> Blue skies, boss.<br> We'll have some sun tomorrow<br> Yeah, we'll get a good<br> day's work done tomorrow<br>
