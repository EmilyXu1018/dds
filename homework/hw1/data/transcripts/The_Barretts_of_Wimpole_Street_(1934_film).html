                        Almighty Father giver of all good gifts...<br> ... who of thy divine providence<br> has provided thy unworthy servants...<br> ... with all things necessary to their bodily sustenance,<br> Grant, we beseech thee, spiritual grace...<br> ... that we may enjoy it in<br> quietness of spirit as proof of Thy bounty...<br> ... and render unto Thee<br> most humble and hearty thank. Amen<br> No, my dear. We doctors can't do everything.<br> Oh, my dear Dr. Chambers, you've done a great deal.<br> Yes, but now it's your turn.<br> You've got to help. You've got to want to get well.<br> Oh, if I could, I'd be downstairs now<br> having dinner with pa and the others.<br> But if you shut a person up<br> in one room for years on end...<br> ... you can't very well expect<br> to find her bursting with life and vigor.<br> Tell me, Miss Elizabeth,<br> have you ventured on your feet at all lately ?<br> No, hardly at all.<br> Sometimes when I'm feeling venturesome,<br> my maid supports me across the room.<br> You know, the fact is a change<br> from these surroundings would do you a world of good.<br> Italy is the place for you.<br> Italy...<br> Oh, no, doctor. This is my Italy.<br> Rubbish ! That's just it.<br> You don't want to go anywhere,<br> you don't want to see anybody.<br> Confounded, my dear.<br> Isn't there something you want to do ?<br> Yes, and I'm doing it.<br> I'm writing poetry.<br> And there are those<br> who think it isn't such bad poetry.<br> Mr. Robert Browning has sent me several kind letters of approval.<br> Browning ?<br> Never heard of him.<br> Oh, you will, some day.<br> I daresay. Well, I'm glad at least<br> there is something you care about.<br> Eve if it's only poetry ?<br> Yes, only don't overtax yourself.<br> All right. One small verse to be written<br> an hour after each meal with a little water.<br> Oh, doctor, that reminds me.<br> Sit down a minute.<br> Do you remember papa suggesting to you<br> that a certain kind of beer called Porter might do me good ?<br> Yes, and an excellent suggestion, too.<br> Oh, forgive me. But it was nothing of the kind.<br> I've had to drink it twice a day<br> and in consequence my life has become one long misery.<br> Bless my soul.<br> I'm not exaggerating, one long misery.<br> You poor little lady.<br> It's no use my appealing to papa<br> But if you did, Dr. Chambers,<br> suggest to him that something else might be equally beneficial...<br> What would you say to<br> a couple of glasses of hot milk as a substitute ?<br> I hate milk, but I'll drink it all day long<br> if you'll only rescue me from Porter.<br> Come in.<br> Beg your pardon, Miss Elizabeth.<br> May I take the tray now ?<br> Yes, Wilson.<br> Well, goodbye, Miss Elizabeth.<br> Goodbye, doctor, and you won't forget...<br> Eh ?<br> P-O-R-T-E-R.<br> I'll speak to him about it now.<br> Oh, thank you, doctor, thank you.<br> Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, old man.<br> Good night.<br> Thank God, away with it !<br> What, miss ?<br> The Porter, Quick take it away<br> and never mention the word to me again.<br> Very good, miss.<br> Since you haven't had your Porter...<br> I told you never to mention the word to me again.<br> Now, take it away, please. Please.<br> Very good, Miss Ba.<br> Hello, dear. May we come in ?<br> Yes, come in.<br> How was dinner ? Was papa... ?<br> He was, and dinner was awful.<br> Awful awful, awful.<br> Oh, Ba, dear, I do hope for all our sakes<br> that Dr. Chambers' report of you isn't too good.<br> It won't be.<br> Oh, darling.<br> Forgive me, dearest.<br> You know I didn't mean it, don't you ?<br> But any good news seems to depress him so.<br> It isn't pa's fault, I suppose.<br> In his way he loves us all.<br> In his way...<br> Captain Cook ? Is he nice ?<br> He seems quite nice.<br> I can't tell, of course. He isn't allowed to call.<br> Do you think it's serious ?<br> Oh, Ba, I hope not.<br> Do you remember when young Mr. Paul Frey<br> wanted to marry her two years ago ?<br> The dreadful scene with papa.<br> He's there.<br> Oh, Ba, I wish you could see him.<br> So drawn. So soldierly.<br> I can imagine.<br> It's so mean. He'll wait there for hours.<br> Just hoping that I can slip out for a moment.<br> And so I will.<br> But Henrietta. Papa ?<br> Oh, I know.<br> It's dreadfully imprudent, dear. And not very ladylike.<br> I don't care.<br> I don't care ! I...<br> Hello, Ba dear. I've just cccome to see<br> how you are and to wwwish you good night.<br> Come in.<br> Come in, Henry.<br> Ba, my dear, how are you ?<br> Better, thank you.<br> How's our dear tonight<br> How's our dear Ba tonight ?<br> Alfred.<br> How are you, Ba ?<br> I do think you're looking a little better.<br> Do you think so ?<br> What do you say, Charles ?<br> What ?<br> Looking better. More herself.<br> Well, Septimus.<br> How's Ba tonight ?<br> The doctor's just been here<br> and I'm afraid he wasn't too pleased with you.<br> No ?<br> Not looking quite so well, is she, Albert ?<br> On the contrary, I think she's looking considerably better.<br> So does Charles. don't you, Charles ?<br> What ?<br> Come in, George.<br> My dear.<br> How's the world's greatest poetess ?<br> The world's greatest poetess is much better, thank you.<br> Hello, Flush, old chum.<br> Come in.<br> A note for Mr. George.<br> I wonder what's in the note.<br> A note ?<br> From the master, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> When papa starts sending out notes from his study...<br> ... the crowds must draw. Read it for us !<br> Hear ye. Hear ye ! Hear ye ! This is undoubtedly a royal decree.<br> Given at our study at 50 Wimpole Street on this<br> the 19th day of November, 1845. God save papa !<br> What is it, George ?<br> You'll all be interested to learn that papa<br> is going to Plymouth on business this weekend...<br> And what ? Go on !<br> And that he's not expected to return for at least a fortnight.<br> George, will you Polk ?<br> Not a chance.<br> Well, I'll Polk.<br> Ha ha ha you and me<br> little brown jug don't I love thee<br> Ha ha ha you and me<br> little brown jug don't I love thee<br> My wife and I lived all alone in a little brown hut we called our own<br> She loves gin and I love rum<br> tell you what don't we have fun<br> Ha ha ha you and me<br> little brown jug don't I love thee<br> Ha ha ha you and me<br> little brown jug don't I love thee<br> Ha ha ha...<br> Good evening, papa.<br> I am most displeased.<br> I think I have told not once but several times<br> that in your sister's very precarious state of health...<br> ... it is not advisable for more than three of you<br> to be in her room at the same time.<br> You all of you know that she must avoid every kind of excitement...<br> ... and yet I find you rumping around her like a lot of disorderly children.<br> I am gravely displeased.<br> I am not aware that I have said anything amusing, Henrietta.<br> I beg your pardon, sir.<br> May I ask what you were doing as I came into the room ?<br> Showing Ba the polk.<br> How to...<br> to... dance the Polka.<br> I see.<br> Well, Ba, I think I'll say good night and...<br> I'd be grateful if you allowed me to finish speaking.<br> Are you being insolent, sir ?<br> No, indeed, sir. I assure you...<br> Very well.<br> Now...<br> Papa. I like nothing better than a little noise occasionally.<br> Perhaps you won't forgive my saying, Elizabeth,<br> but you're not the best judge of what is good or bad for you.<br> And that brings me to what I came here to speak to you about.<br> Dr. Chambers has just told me...<br> ... that you have persuaded him<br> to allow you to discontinue drinking Porter.<br> It needed very little persuasion, papa.<br> I said I detested Porter<br> and he agreed at once that I should take milk instead.<br> I questioned him closely<br> as to the comparative strenght giving values of milk and Porter...<br> ... and he was forced to admit that Porter came decidedly first.<br> That may be, but when you dislike a thing to loathing,<br> I don't see how it can do you any good.<br> Your likes and dislikes<br> are quite beside the point in a case like this.<br> But Dr. Chambers himself...<br> I have told you what Dr. Chambers said.<br> But, papa...<br> Did you drink your Porter at dinner ?<br> No.<br> Then I hope you'll will do so before you go to bed.<br> No, papa. That's really asking too much.<br> I can't drink the horrible stuff in cold blood.<br> Of course I have no means of cohersing you...<br> ... but I intend to give<br> your better nature every chance of asserting itself.<br> A tankard of Porter<br> will be left at your bedside and I hope that by tomorrow...<br> ... you will be able to tell me that you have obeyed your father.<br> Sorry, papa, but I shan't drink it.<br> Henrietta, go and fetch a tankard of Porter.<br> No.<br> I beg your pardon ?<br> It's sheer cruelty.<br> You know how Ba hates the stuff.<br> You're just torturing her because you like torturing.<br> I have told you to fetch a tankard of Porter.<br> I won't do it.<br> Must I ask you a third time ?<br> Obey me this instant !<br> Papa !<br> Go and fetch it, Henrietta. Go at once.<br> I can't stand this.<br> Oh, no, Ba...<br> Please.<br> You had all better say good night to your sister.<br> Good night, darling.<br> Good night, Ba, dear.<br> Good night, darling.<br> Give it to me, please.<br> No. You may go.<br> Good night, darling.<br> You may go !<br> Elizabeth, why do you look at me like that, child ?<br> Are you frightened ?<br> No.<br> You're trembling. Why ?<br> I... don't know.<br> You're not frightened of me.<br> No, no.<br> Don't say it. I couldn't bear it.<br> You're everything in the world to me and you know that.<br> Without you I should be quite alone and you know that too.<br> If you love me<br> you can't be afraid of me, for love casts out fear.<br> You love me, my darling ? You love your father ?<br> Yes.<br> Then you will prove your love by doing as I wish.<br> But I don't understand. I was going to drink...<br> Yes, out of fear, not love.<br> Listen to me, my dear.<br> I shall never in any way reproach you.<br> You shalll never know by deed or word or hint of mine...<br> ... how much you have grieved and wounded your father<br> by refusing to do the little that he asked of you.<br> Oh, papa. Let us get this over with and forget it.<br> I can't forgive myself for having made<br> the whole house miserable over a tankard of Porter.<br> You're acting of your own free will and not...<br> Yes, papa, yes.<br> You're not feeling any worse tonight, my darling.<br> No, papa.<br> Just tired ?<br> Yes, just tired.<br> I'd better leave you now.<br> Shall I say a little prayer with you before I go ?<br> Please, papa.<br> Almighty and merciful God...<br> in thine inscrutable wisdom<br> thou hast seen fit to lay upon thy daughter Elizabeth...<br> ... grievous and heavy afflictions.<br> For many years she hath languished in sickness...<br> ... for many years, unless in thy mercy thou take her to thyself, she may languish on.<br> Give her to bear her sufferings in patience.<br> Give her to fix her heart and soul on thee.<br> And on that heavenly eternity<br> which may at any moment open out before her...<br> Amen.<br> Amen.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, papa.<br> Better see your bed now, Miss Ba.<br> Oh, what a pity.<br> These flowers are dead, just since this morning.<br> Why don't they live longer ?<br> Nothing lives in this room.<br> What was that, miss ?<br> Oh, Wilson, I'm so tired.<br> Tired, tired.<br> Will it never end ?<br> End, miss ?<br> This long, long gray death of life.<br> Oh, Miss Ba, you shouldn't say such things.<br> No, I suppose I shouldn't.<br> Is it a fine night outside ?<br> Yes, it cleared up nicely after the rain.<br> And there's such a lovely moon.<br> Moon ? Do you think I could see it from here ?<br> Mm, I don't know, I'm sure.<br> Pull back the curtains.<br> There you are.<br> The moon is right above the chimney.<br> Yes.<br> Please put out the lamps, Wilson,<br> and leave me for a little while.<br> I don't want to go to bed quite yet.<br> Very well, Miss Ba.<br> Be careful.<br> Don't talk to me.<br> The woman opposite is watching.<br> Listen. But don't look at me.<br> It was kind of you to come so far.<br> And in the snow.<br> I wish I could ask you in, but I daren't.<br> Aren't you freezing ?<br> Don't answer me !<br> You're so tall.<br> I wish I could see you in full uniform. Could I ?<br> Don't tell me !<br> I daren't stay any longer.<br> It looks so odd.<br> And in this weather.<br> I'll come again tomorrow.<br> You'll wait for me, won't you ?<br> Don't tell me.<br> Goodbye. Goodbye.<br> Miss Barrett.<br> Hush !<br> But I say, Miss Barrett...<br> If the thing were only in the proper footing...<br> If you'd permit me to call on your father...<br> You mustn't think of it.<br> You'd be ordered out of the house.<br> But if I made it quite clear ?<br> My intentions are perfectly honorable and all that.<br> But that would make it worse.<br> Ever distinctly fatal, don't you see ?<br> I can't say that I do.<br> Papa would never permit any of us to marry.<br> A marriage in the family ?<br> He just almost goes insanely angry if you talk of it.<br> Yes, but I mean...<br> Oh, I say !<br> I proposed and I thought it would be so difficult.<br> Oh, yes, Wilson, I'm quite ready for my lunch.<br> You've had your lunch, Miss Ba.<br> Oh, yes, of course. I enjoyed it very much.<br> Let's keep covered up.<br> These cold days are are that treacherous.<br> No, it's quite beyond me.<br> I give it up.<br> Beg your pardon ?<br> Wilson, have you noticed anything strange in me today ?<br> Strange, miss ?<br> Yes, strange. I mean stupid, thickheaded, idiotic.<br> Good gracious, no, miss.<br> Very well.<br> But now listen carefully and see what you can make of this.<br> And after, for pastime, if June be refulgent<br> with flowers in completeness.<br> All petals, no prickles, delicious as trickles of wine..<br> ... poured at mass time<br> And choose one indulgent<br> To redness and sweetness.<br> Or if, with experience of man and of spider,<br> June use my June-lightning, the strong insect-ridder,<br> To stop the fresh film-work... why, June will consider.<br> I call that just lovely, Miss Ba.<br> Yes, but do you know what it means ?<br> Oh, no, miss.<br> Does it convey anything at all to your mind ?<br> Oh, no, Miss Ba.<br> Well, thank heavens for that.<br> But then, real poetry never does, miss.<br> Least ways not real poetry like what you make.<br> Oh, but I didn't write that.<br> It's by Mr. Browning.<br> Oh, he must be a clever gentleman.<br> Oh, Ba. Cousin Bella is here. May she come in ?<br> Yes, dear.<br> Oh. And Ba, just think. She's engaged.<br> She's going to be married.<br> Cousin Elizabeth !<br> Dear, dear cousin.<br> Bella, dear.<br> What's this I hear, engaged ?<br> Yes.<br> I just had to run right over and tell you.<br> Well, congratulations, dear.<br> Isn't it too thrilling ?<br> Harry couldn't come, but I'll bring him next time.<br> May I ? Oh, you'll love Harry.<br> I'm sure we shall. Harry who ?<br> Harry Bevan.<br> Oh, Henrietta, the very person !<br> I want want you to be one of my bridesmaids.<br> Bridesmaid ?<br> Yes, you simply must.<br> Cousin Bella's engaged. She's going to be married.<br> I want you te be a bridesmaid.<br> Oh, yes, it's your wedding. Thank you.<br> It's going to be a great big wedding.<br> Twelve bridesmaids.<br> You must help me to pick out the dresses.<br> And I'm going to wear mother's wedding veil.<br> Don't you just love weddings, Henrietta ?<br> Yes, I love weddings.<br> And we're going to Paris on our honeymoon.<br> And then to Rome.<br> And then we're going to take the dearest, sweetest little house.<br> It'll be just too thrilling for words.<br> And I'll be so happy to have you for a bridesmaid.<br> Thank you, Bella.<br> Of course, I'd love to if papa...<br> Oh, I don't see how he can possibly object.<br> Object ? Isn't she funny, Ba ?<br> You're only being asked to be a bridesmaid,<br> not a bride.<br> Yes, I know, Bella. Oh, it's so hard to explain.<br> What's the matter ?<br> You know what's the matter.<br> It's simply that nothing at all can happen without papa's assention.<br> We've got to obey his least will.<br> We can't move hand or foot without his permission.<br> We haven't got a soul of our own, not one of us.<br> Henrietta !<br> Or have we ? Have we, Ba ?<br> I tell you, Bella. He'll more than likely refuse<br> to let me be your bridesmaid...<br> ... and just because he's in a beastly temper.<br> Oh, gracious, cousin Henrietta,<br> you mustn't say such things about uncle Edward.<br> And I'm afraid we're disturbing poor dear cousin Elizabeth.<br> Poor, Ba. So pale, so fragile, so wisteria.<br> One has only to see your dear face<br> to know how near you are to heaven.<br> I wouldn't quite say that, Bella.<br> Oh, yes, you always have a look in your eyes...<br> ... as if you already saw the angels.<br> I really must be going.<br> Goodbye. I'll come again and bring Harry.<br> Yes, do.<br> Oh, you mustn't tell anybody about my getting married.<br> It's to be a big surprise.<br> And don't worry, cousin Henrietta. I'll manage uncle Edward.<br> Men are really so easy to manage.<br> If you just know how.<br> But, of course, you girls have had so little experience.<br> Goodbye, dear, dear cousins.<br> Well, why don't you say something ?<br> What do you want me to say ?<br> Nothing.<br> Oh, Ba, darling. Don't disown me.<br> I deserve it, I know.<br> But I couldn't help it.<br> I'm so miserable.<br> Miserable, dear ?<br> Yes, and so wildly happy.<br> Oh, Ba, darling. Do you mind if I tell you about it ?<br> I oughtn't to, I know...<br> ... because if papa ever found out you knew about it<br> he'd spend half his anger on you for not warning him.<br> What are you talking about, dear ?<br> Surtees has just asked me to marry him.<br> Surtees ?<br> Captain Cook. I've told you about him.<br> The guardsman, you know.<br> Yes, I remember, dear.<br> And of course I expected him and said that I couldn't...<br> ... and I had to tell him we must<br> never never see each other again so when we meet tomorrow...<br> You're not talking sense, child.<br> What really has happened ?<br> I don't know, Ba.<br> Except that we both love each other.<br> Terribly.<br> Oh, my darling.<br> But Henrietta, papa...<br> Do you think I haven't thought of that ?<br> He'll never consent. Never.<br> I know.<br> Ba, dear, is there anything at all<br> to be said for papa's attitude towards marriage ?<br> Can it possibly be wrong<br> to want a man's love desperately and...<br> long for babies of my own ?<br> Love and babies are something I don't know much about.<br> I know, dear, you're a woman apart.<br> But love and babies are natural to a normal girl like me.<br> And what's natural can't be wrong.<br> No...<br> And yet the holiest men and women renounce these things.<br> I daresay, Ba. But I'm not holy.<br> It's different for you. You're a great genius.<br> Oh, yes you are. You've got your work, your studies.<br> But do you know, Ba ?<br> Sometimes I wonder.<br> Are you completely satisfied ?<br> Is it enough just to correspond<br> with Mr. Browning, for instance ?<br> Don't you sometimes wish that you could see him ?<br> If I could see and not be seen.<br> Why ?<br> Because at heart I'm as vain as a peacock.<br> He thinks my verse is stately and beautiful.<br> Probably thinks me the same.<br> It would be so humiliating to disillusion him.<br> Oh, don't be silly, Ba. You're very interesting and picturesque.<br> Isn't that how the guidebooks usually describe a ruin ?<br> Oh, Ba, I didn't mean it.<br> Of course.<br> Tell me, is your friend very nice ?<br> Surtees ?<br> Yes.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Oh, Ba, what are we to do ?<br> Ba, do you think it would be wiser<br> if we were never to see each other again ?<br> I think it might be wiser, dear.<br> Oh...<br> But at your age one shouldn't be too wise.<br> Oh, Ba.<br> Come in.<br> A gentleman just brought this, dear.<br> A gentleman ?<br> Yes. And he said he would wait for an answer.<br> Really ?<br> Who is it from ?<br> Henrietta !<br> A moment, dear.<br> Oh !<br> Oh, Ba, dear, whatever is it ?<br> Oh, really !<br> Please tell us, darling.<br> Why, Ba, you're blushing.<br> No wonder ! Listen to this.<br> "Dear Miss Barrett,<br> I am unable to restrain my impatience to meet you...<br> ... and have taken it upon myself to select February 15th"...<br> that's today... ..."for that important occasion.<br> And I am at this moment seated<br> in your front hall awaiting your permission to present myself."<br> Wait a moment, there's more.<br> "I might add that I shall continue to sit here until<br> you gratify the earnest desire that prompts my impertinent persistence.<br> Sincerely yours, Robert Browning."<br> Robert Browning !<br> Oh, Ba, I like this Mr. Browning. You must see him.<br> No, I can't. At least not today.<br> But you should. It can't do you any harm.<br> Why not ?<br> I don't feel up to it. Really I don't. Another time.<br> I shall go and see him myself<br> and I'll send him up.<br> No, Henrietta ! Stay here.<br> I can't see him. I really don't<br> feel that I could see him now.<br> Arabel, tell Mr. Browning that I am very sorry<br> but I'm not well enought to see him.<br> But Ba, that's not true. You can't send him away.<br> But I'd much rather not see him.<br> Oh, fie. You're not a silly schoolgirl, I'll bring him up myself.<br> Is my hair tidy ?<br> Yes, dear. You look quite nice.<br> Arabel, fix the covers.<br> Yes.<br> Flush, get down dear.<br> Arabel...<br> Yes, dear ?<br> No... yes. No, never mind.<br> Yes, dear.<br> Thank you.<br> Arabel !<br> Arabel, do I...<br> Yes, darling.<br> You do. Really.<br> Mr. Robert Browning.<br> Miss Barrett.<br> Dear Miss Barrett, at last.<br> At last !<br> How do you do, Mr. Browning ?<br> I've had to put off the pleasure<br> of meeting you much longer than I wished.<br> Yes, that is it.<br> I beg your pardon ?<br> That voice.<br> I've heard that voice a thousand times.<br> How strange.<br> I've not been at all well this winter and I...<br> Won't you take off your cape ?<br> Thank you.<br> Wonderful !<br> Wonderful !<br> You may think, Miss Barrett, that this is the first time that I've been here,<br> but you're quite wrong, you know.<br> But...<br> Oh, yes, quite wrong.<br> I've seen this room more times than I can remember.<br> It's as familiar to me<br> as my own little study at home.<br> Before I came in<br> I knew just how your books were arranged.<br> Just how that tendril of ivy slanted across the window pane.<br> And those portraits of Homer and Chaucer are quite old friends.<br> No, really.<br> You know, I could never make out<br> who those other fellas were on the top of the wardrobe.<br> Oh, come, Mr. Browning. I can't believe that one of my friends<br> has bored you with a description of my poor little room.<br> I have pestered them for all the details I could possibly get.<br> And my imagination supplied the rest.<br> Directly after I read your brave and lovely verses<br> I was greedy for anything and everything I could get about you.<br> Oh, what they must have told you !<br> Oh, nothing they told me about you personally<br> had the slightest interest for me.<br> Because I knew it already. And better than they.<br> Oh, Mr. Browning. Do my writings give me so hopelessly away ?<br> Hopelessly, utterly, entirely. To me.<br> Of course I can't speak for the rest of the world.<br> I'm afraid it will be quite useless...<br> ... my ever trying to play act with you.<br> Quite useless.<br> I shall always have to be just myself ?<br> Always.<br> But you, you're never yourself in any of your poems.<br> It's always somebody else speaking through you.<br> Yes, and shall I tell you why ?<br> I'm a very modest man.<br> I am. really !<br> We didn't question that, Mr. Browning.<br> So modest, I fully realize that if I wrote about myself<br> my poems would be intolerably dull.<br> Oh, but those poems.<br> With their glad and great-hearted acceptance of life.<br> You can't imagine what they mean to me.<br> Here I am shut in by these four walls and...<br> ... and they troupe into my room,<br> those wonderful people of yours.<br> Out of every age and country and...<br> ... and all so tingling with life.<br> No, you'll never begin to realize just...<br> ... just how much I do owe you.<br> You really mean that ?<br> Of course you do, or you wouldn't say it.<br> You don't find me difficult, obscure ?<br> Many people do.<br> Surely not.<br> Yet, to me it's simple and easy as the rule of three.<br> And to you ?<br> No, not quite always.<br> Sometimes there are passages that...<br> I've marked one or two in your Sordello which rather puzzled me.<br> Ah, Sordello.<br> Somebody once called it a horror of great gothic.<br> I've done my best to forget it.<br> Here it is.<br> All right...<br> But then, a passage torn from its context...<br> All petals, no prickles...<br> No prickles like trickles...<br> Well ?<br> Well, Miss Barrett...<br> ... when that passage was written,<br> only God and Robert Browning understood it.<br> Now, only God understands it.<br> What do you say ? Shall we lighten<br> this great darkness by pitching it on the fire ?<br> No, indeed, we shall do nothing of the kind.<br> Please give me back the book.<br> I love Sordello.<br> You would.<br> Of curse you would. And shall I tell you why ?<br> Because it is a collossal failure<br> By a failure you mean an attempt.<br> Yes, you're right.<br> That's just why Sordello appeals to my very heart.<br> I too am always making collossal attempts.<br> And always failing.<br> But is not one such failure worth a hundred small successes ?<br> Oh, a thousand and more.<br> You think so too ?<br> But of course. I knew that.<br> Miss Barrett, you smiled when I told you<br> that your friends had no need to describe you because I knew you already.<br> But what you've just told me<br> about success and failure proves to me finally how right I was.<br> Tell me, did your fancy paint<br> my background with a very gloomy brush ?<br> The background possibly.<br> But the portrait of you I had painted with the true soul of you.<br> Ardent and lovely looking out of you.<br> Ardent and lovely.<br> Oh, Mr. Browning, you think you know me.<br> Too often impatient and rebelious.<br> Oh, what of it. I've no love for perfect patience under affliction.<br> My portrait is the portrait of a woman, not a saint.<br> I suppose people have told you that I...<br> ... that I'm a dying woman.<br> We are all of us dying.<br> And you find me a very pitiful object ?<br> I find you as I pictured you.<br> Full of courage and gaiety.<br> And yet I'm not at all sure that my colors were too somber.<br> But...<br> No, no, listen to me.<br> Those colors are not yet dry.<br> They must be scraped off.<br> The whole background must be repainted.<br> And if only you will allow it,<br> I must have a hand in that splendid work.<br> But this is...<br> No, listen.<br> I'll get my brush in the sunrise, the sunset and the rainbow.<br> You say my verses have helped you but they are nothing.<br> It's I, I who am going to help you now.<br> We've come together at last,<br> and I don't intend to let you go again.<br> Give me your hand.<br> I've more strength than is good for one man.<br> Up to now I've spent a little of that surplus energy<br> in creating imaginary men and women.<br> But there's still so much to give.<br> Mayn't I give it to you ?<br> Don't you feel in your life tingling and prickling<br> up your fingers and arms right into your heart and brain ?<br> Oh, please.<br> Mr. Browning, please let go of my hand.<br> Well ?<br> You're really rather an overwhelming person...<br> ... and in sober truth I...<br> Don't tell me that you're afraid of me.<br> You're not.<br> It's life you're afraid of, and that shouldn't be.<br> Life ?<br> Yes.<br> When life becomes a series of electric shocks I...<br> Was it as bad as all that ?<br> Indeed yes.<br> Do you affect other people in that way ?<br> They've often told me so.<br> No wonder I hesitated<br> about meeting you, much as I wanted to.<br> You know, you'll laugh at me, Mr. Browning,<br> but when my sister told me you were downstairs...<br> ... I was so panic stricken that I almost<br> sent a message down saying that I was too unwell to receive you.<br> I think I must have been quite<br> as nervous as you at that moment...<br> ... and I'm anything but a nervous man as a rule.<br> But that moment was the climax of my life.<br> Up to now.<br> Miss Barrett, do you remember the first letter I ever wrote you ?<br> Yes, indeed. It was a wonderful letter.<br> You may have thought I dashed it off<br> in a fit white out right out enthusiasm over your poems...<br> ... but I didn't.<br> I weighed every word of every sentence.<br> And of one sentence in particular.<br> This sentence: I love your books with all my heart.<br> And I love you, too.<br> Do you remember ?<br> Yes. I thought it was charmingly impulsive of you.<br> But there was nothing impulsive about it.<br> That sentence was as deeply felt<br> and anxiously thought over as any sentence I've ever written.<br> I hope I have many readers like you.<br> It's wonderful to think I may have good friends<br> all over the world whom I've never seen or heard of.<br> I'm not speaking of friendship but of love.<br> It's quite useless your trying to put aside the word with a smile and a jest.<br> I said love and I mean love.<br> Really, Mr. Browning, I must ask you to...<br> I'm insanely in love as any man alive.<br> In all these months<br> since I first read your poems I've been haunted by you.<br> And today you are the center of my life.<br> Mr. Browning...<br> If I were to take you seriously<br> it would have caused me the quick finish of a friendship which...<br> ... promises to be very pleasant for both of us.<br> Why ?<br> You know very well that love<br> in the sense that you apparently use the word...<br> ... has no place, and can have no place in my life.<br> Why ?<br> For many reasons, but let it suffice...<br> as I told you before...<br> ... I am a dying woman.<br> I refuse to believe it.<br> If that were so, God would be cruel.<br> And I know that He's compassionate.<br> And life would be dark and evil, and I know that it's good.<br> You must never say such a thing again.<br> I forbid you to.<br> Forbid, Mr. Browning ?<br> Yes, forbid.<br> Isn't it only fair that if you forbid me to speak with you<br> as I fear and I accept your orders, as I must...<br> ... that I should be allowed a little forbidding as well ?<br> Yes, but...<br> Dear Miss Barrett, what a splendid beginning to our friendship.<br> We've known each other a bare half hour<br> and yet we talk infinitely of art, and life, and death, and love.<br> We've oredered each other about and we've almost quarrelled.<br> Could anything be happier or more promising ?<br> With your permission, I'm going now.<br> I promised myself to make my first visit as short as possible.<br> Strangers are undoubtedly tiring.<br> Not that I am a stranger.<br> Still I could see that you're tired.<br> When may I call again ?<br> I don't quite know. Will next Wednesday suit you ?<br> Yes, I think so, but perhaps it would be better...<br> Next Wednesday.<br> At half past three again ?<br> yes, but I...<br> Au revoir, then.<br> Goodbye.<br> Au revoir.<br> Au revoir.<br> Thank you.<br> Splendid, splendid.<br> Really remarkable.<br> Once more, dear.<br> My dear Miss Barrett I congratulate you.<br> Now sit down.<br> You've done wonders, doctor.<br> The real healer is no one but Miss Barrett herself.<br> The will to live is better than a dozen physicians.<br> The will to live.<br> Mm. Yes.<br> Well now, Miss Barrett, about the future.<br> I fully agree with Dr. Chambers<br> that another winter in London must be avoided.<br> I see no reason against<br> your travelling South by October, say ?<br> Travelling South.<br> The Riviera, or better still, to Italy.<br> Italy ? Oh, Doctor, do you really mean it ?<br> Why not ?<br> I've taken the liberty to tell the doctor of the only real difficulty,<br> and he's quite prepared to deal with... him.<br> Quite, and drastically.<br> Oh, but I don't think it will be necessary.<br> Papa may not raise any objection at all.<br> It all depends on how he's feeling at the time.<br> Oh, fiddlesticks, my dear young lady...<br> ... Mr. Barrett's feelings are neither here not there.<br> What matters is his daughter's health and happiness.<br> And I intend to make it clear to him, quite clear.<br> What a beautiful day it is... I must be going, Miss Barrett.<br> Don't get up, don't get up.<br> I'm delighted with your improvement.<br> Delighted.<br> I'll put a little talk with your father.<br> Goodbye, Miss Barrett.<br> Goodbye, doctor.<br> Italy ! Italy ! Italy !<br> And you are coming too, Flush.<br> We'll see Rome together.<br> Rome, Venice and Naples.<br> See Naples and die...<br> Only I'm not going to die.<br> I'm not going to die.<br> Yes ?<br> Mr. Browning is here, Miss Ba.<br> You may ask him to come up.<br> Very good, miss.<br> No, wait.<br> Don't trouble, I'll go down.<br> Oh, Miss Ba. You won't think of it.<br> I shall not only think of it, but do it.<br> What's more, I shall do it alone.<br> You must let me help you. It's not safe.<br> You've not walked downstairs for years.<br> Let me alone, Wilson. I shall be quite all right.<br> I can do anything.<br> You see ?<br> Oh, Miss Ba.<br> Mr. Browning.<br> It is you !<br> Why this is magnificent.<br> Magnificent.<br> I... well I...<br> And I did it all alone.<br> I walked down those stairs alone. A hundred of them.<br> A hundred ?<br> Well, fifty.<br> This is only the first step.<br> In a little while you'll be able to drive, to walk in the park.<br> In the sun and fresh air.<br> Come, come sit down.<br> Oh, wonderful<br> Wonderful.<br> Here. Sit here in the sunlight.<br> Careful.<br> There we are.<br> There. Now, that's the setting I've dreamed for you.<br> The setting I'm going to keep you in.<br> Now tell me. Tell me quickly.<br> I've been in suspense all day.<br> You've seen the doctors. What did they say ?<br> Dr. Ford-Waterlow was quite taken out<br> of his grumpy self with astonishment over my improval.<br> Say that again.<br> Oh, must I, the whole sentence ?<br> I should like to see it in letters of fire<br> burning at me from each of these four walls.<br> This is the best moment I've had<br> since the day I gave myself permission to call on you.<br> How many years ago was that ?<br> Three months.<br> So... we've always been friends.<br> I've known you a lifetime, you know.<br> So he was almost taken out<br> of his grumpy self with delight, was he ?<br> Splendid. Of course I never once doubted<br> that you'd turn the corner some day.<br> I've told you so a hundred times.<br> And Italy ? Both doctors agreed about your wintering there ?<br> Yes.<br> This is wonderful. I'm quite off my head with excitement.<br> Unless, of course, papa should withhold his consent and...<br> Oh, that I just refuse to anticipate<br> When do they think you'll be fit for travel ?<br> The middle of October.<br> Unless there is a relapse.<br> Relapse ? Why, there isn't such a word.<br> October ?<br> That's extraordinary.<br> You know, October suits my own plans to perfection.<br> Your plans ?<br> Don't you remember my telling you<br> that had thought of wintering in Italy myself ?<br> Well, now I'm quite decided.<br> Oh, papa, isn't it wonderful ?<br> I walked downstairs.<br> So I observe.<br> A miracle, sir.<br> Nothing more or less than a miracle.<br> Did your doctors authorize this amazing imprudence ?<br> No, papa.<br> I should not have been surprised if they had.<br> Aren't you proud of me, papa ?<br> I thought there should be dancing in the streets.<br> A general holiday.<br> Mr. Browning, my daughter's health<br> has been my main concern for many years...<br> You'll permit me to remind you that<br> I'm much better informed on the subject than an outsider ?<br> I shall carry you to your room.<br> Oh, no, papa.<br> I don't need you, really.<br> Surely, Mr. Barrett...<br> Mr. Browning, I must say goodbye.<br> Thank you for calling.<br> Elizabeth.<br> Elizabeth.<br> You can't do it.<br> Elizabeth.<br> There, my child.<br> I'm all right, papa.<br> I could have done this.<br> You ought to rest to regain your strength.<br> All this talk and activity is most harmful.<br> I'd appreciate it if you tried to get a little sleep.<br> Papa.<br> Well ?<br> I'm all right, really I am.<br> Dr. Ford-Waterlow said I was. Didn't he tell you ?<br> Dr. Ford-Waterlow talked,<br> if I may say so, a great deal of nonsense.<br> But papa...<br> I'm naturally more than gratified at your improvement,<br> I'm delighted, of course, my poor child,<br> but it's unlikely you'll ever be a normal woman.<br> But I do feel so much better.<br> Perhaps it's the wonderful weather we've been having.<br> I always thrive in warmth, sunshine...<br> Rubbish ! Last time it was sweltering<br> and you've never been worse than then.<br> No, to my mind there is<br> only one whom we have to thank...<br> ... though this doctor whatsisname<br> would probably sneer if I mentioned him.<br> Him ?<br> I mean Almighty God.<br> That's all I have to say at present.<br> Papa.<br> What is it ?<br> Didn't he tell you that I should avoid spending next winter in England ?<br> Well...<br> And that he thinks<br> I should be able to travel to Italy in October ?<br> If you...<br> So !<br> ... it's out at last.<br> And how long has this precious plot been hatching, may I ask ?<br> You've discussed your plans<br> with all your friends and relatives, I suppose...<br> ... with this Browning fellow too.<br> And I, I alone am left out of my favorite daughter's confidence.<br> Treated like a cypher, insultant.<br> Insultant ?<br> I'm cut to the heart that you,<br> the only one of my children whom I trusted implicitly...<br> ... should be capable of such underhand conduct.<br> No, papa. No !<br> If returning health must bring<br> with it such a sad change of character,<br> I should be driven to wish<br> that you were once more lying helpless on this sofa.<br> There's nothing more to be said.<br> But there is more to be said.<br> And I must beg you to listen, papa.<br> How many years have I lain here ?<br> Five, six ? It's hard to remember,<br> each year seemed like ten to me.<br> And all that time I've had nothing<br> to look forward to or hope for but death.<br> Death ?<br> Yes, death !<br> I was born with a large capacity for happiness.<br> You remember me as a little girl.<br> And then when life brought me a little happiness<br> and much pain I was often impatient for the end.<br> Elizabeth !<br> Then this miracle happened.<br> Day by day I'm better able to take and enjoy<br> such good things that everyone has a right to.<br> Able to meet my friends, to breathe the open air,<br> to feel the sun and see the grass and flowers beneath the sky.<br> When Dr. Chambers first spoke to me about Italy...<br> I put the idea from me.<br> It seemed too impossibly wonderful<br> But as I grew stronger, it came over me as a revelation<br> that Italy wasn't an impossibility at all.<br> That nothing stood in my way of going.<br> That I really had a right to go.<br> Right ?<br> Yes, every right !<br> In my eagerness, I may have acted mistakenly, stupidly, tactlessly...<br> ... but to call my conduct underhanded, deceitful is more than unkind.<br> It's unjust.<br> Cruel.<br> Self, self, self.<br> No thought, no consideration for anyone but yourself.<br> For anything but your pleasure.<br> Didn't it ever once occur to you<br> that all through the long dark months...<br> that you propose to enjoy yourself in Italy<br> your father would be left here utterly alone ?<br> No.<br> Utterly alone.<br> Your brothers and sisters<br> might as well be shadows for all the companionship they afford me.<br> And you, oh my child, don't think that I haven't noticed<br> that you too are slowly drawing away from your father.<br> That's not true.<br> It is true. New life, new interests, new pleasures, new friends...<br> ... and little by little I'm being pushed into the background.<br> I who used to be your whole world, I who loved you...<br> ... who love you.<br> But papa...<br> No, there's nothing more to be said.<br> You want my consent for this Italian trot.<br> I shall neither give it nor uphold it.<br> If you go I hope you will sometimes<br> spare a thought for your father.<br> Think of him at night, stealing alone<br> in this empty room which once held all he loved.<br> Think of him kneeling alone<br> by the empty sofa imploring the good Shepherd to have...<br> Who's that ?<br> I shall come to you again<br> when you've had time to consider the wisdom of my words.<br> Well, Flush...<br> It seems we aren't going to Italy.<br> Cousin Elizabeth.<br> Hello, dear.<br> I brought Harry to see you.<br> This is my fianc, my dear, dear Harry.<br> Mr. Bevan, Miss Elizabeth Barrett.<br> Delighted, Miss Barrett. Charmed.<br> No, no, Harry. You must take her hand.<br> Such a little hand, so frail, so spiritual.<br> Yes. And a hand that pens so much that is noble and eloquent.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> I am honored, Miss Barrett.<br> So nice of you to come.<br> Thank you.<br> We'll only stay a minute.<br> I trust you're not too weary<br> of being congratulated upon the prize you've won.<br> Thank you, Miss Barrett. A prize indeed.<br> Dear Ba. And doesn't Henrietta look lovely ?<br> She'll be quite the prettiest of my bridesmaids.<br> Indeed I'm afraid she'll draw all eyes from the little bride.<br> At any rate, all the gentlemen's.<br> Oh, Bella, dear...<br> If I hadn't spoken to Uncle Edward myself<br> I should never have had her for a bridesmaid.<br> Yes, my dear, you certainly have a way with you.<br> Spoken to papa ? I like that.<br> While you sat on his knees and stroked his whiskers.<br> And why not ?<br> Isn't he my uncle ?<br> And besides that, I think he's most frightfully thrilling.<br> I adore that stern and gloomy type of gentlemen.<br> Oh, come, come, my pet.<br> And I must tell you, Ba, how much I adore your poems.<br> It's best when dear Harry reads them.<br> He reads so beautifully.<br> And he too adores your poems.<br> Which ought to please you, as he's dreadfully critical.<br> Not at all, not at all.<br> Dear Harry is so frightfully earnest.<br> Yes ?<br> Excuse me, Miss Elizabeth. Mr. Browning is downstairs.<br> Oh...<br> Ask him to wait, please.<br> Oh, no, dear cousin. Ask him to come right up.<br> We have to go downstairs and have tea with Uncle Edward.<br> And besides, we wouldn't dream of interrupting your tte--tte.<br> Isn't it thrilling, Harry ? Mr. Browning, a poet.<br> And Elizabeth a poet. Isn't that a coincidence ?<br> So quaint, my pet, quaint.<br> Ask Mr. Browning to come up now, Wilson.<br> Yes, and I'm quite sure that the tea is ready.<br> Arivederci, dearest Ba.<br> May I come soon again ?<br> Yes. Come whenever you like, Bella dear.<br> Next time I shall want you all to myself.<br> Without Harry.<br> But why must I be excluded ?<br> Because I keep the lids to tell dear Ba<br> about a certain big, big man who might easily<br> grow convinced if he heard me.<br> Oh, come, come, my pet.<br> It has been a pleasure, Miss Barrett.<br> Nice of you to come and see me.<br> Not at all. I have long been looking forward<br> to the honor of meeting you.<br> Good day.<br> Au revoir, darling.<br> Auf wiedersehen.<br> Good day.<br> Oh, Mr. Browning. I'm so thrilled to see you.<br> It is Mr. Browning, isn't it ?<br> It must be because I've often heard<br> him called the handsomest poet in England.<br> Of course you don't know poor little me.<br> Nevertheless, madam, I thank you.<br> Isn't he wonderful ?<br> Isn't he divine ?<br> The loveliest little shivers are running right down my back.<br> Come, come, my pet.<br> I've been unable to think of anything else.<br> What about Italy ? Have you asked him yet ?<br> I'm not to go to Italy.<br> In spite of the fact that both doctors...<br> The doctors may have proposed, but the decision lies elsewhere.<br> But didn't they make it clear to him<br> that this may mean all the difference between life and death ?<br> I believe Dr. Ford-Waterlow spoke very forcibly and...<br> In heaven's name...<br> It's rather hard to explain to seomeone<br> who doesn't know all the circumstances.<br> Papa is very devoted to me...<br> Devoted ?<br> Very devoted to me.<br> He depends a great deal on my companionship.<br> My brothers and sisters, they don't...<br> Devoted !<br> Miss Barrett, may I speak plainly ?<br> Oh, do you think you'd better ?<br> I know more or less how you feel but...<br> Very well.<br> I shall say nothing.<br> You tell me he's devoted to you.<br> I don't understand.<br> I don't understand a devotion<br> that demands favors as if they were rights.<br> I don't understand a devotion<br> that spends itself in petty tyrannies and gross bullying.<br> I don't understand a devotion<br> that grudges you any ray of light and glimpse of happiness.<br> Doesn't even stop at risking<br> your life to gratify its collossal selfishness.<br> Devotion !<br> Give me good, sound,<br> honest hatred other than devotion like that.<br> Mr. Browning, I must ask you...<br> Forgive me but I won't be silent any longer.<br> Even before I met you I knew<br> that sickness wasn't the only shadow on your life.<br> And all these months I felt<br> that other shadow deepen and I have stood by and looked on.<br> But I'm done with pretense from today on.<br> It's not just your comfort and happiness which are at stake now.<br> It's your very life.<br> And I forbid you to play with your life.<br> And I have the right to forbid you.<br> No, please don't say any more.<br> The right. At our first meeting you forbade me to speak of love.<br> But I knew well enough, we both knew,<br> that I was to be much more than just your friend.<br> Even before I passed that door I loved you.<br> And I've gone on loving you.<br> And I shall love you to the end.<br> And beyond.<br> You know that.<br> You've always known it.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I've always known it.<br> And now, for pity's sake,<br> for pity's sake, leave me.<br> If my father had the least suspicion that you were more than a friend,<br> both our lives would be made unbearable.<br> I love you and I shall never leave you.<br> And I love you, Robert.<br> And yet you ask me<br> to take my marching orders and go out of your life.<br> Yes, Robert. But what have I to give you ?<br> I have so little of all that love asks for.<br> I should have refused to see you again after our first meeting.<br> For I loved you then<br> though I would have denied it even to myself.<br> I love you.<br> Oh, Robert.<br> Do you know what you've done for me ?<br> I could have laughed when Dr. Chambers said<br> that I'd heal myself by wanting to live.<br> Oh, I wanted to live eagerly, desperately, passionately,<br> but only because life meant you.<br> You, the sight of your face,<br> the sound of your voice and the touch of your hand.<br> Oh, and so much more than that.<br> Because of you the air once more was sweet to breathe.<br> And all the world was good and green again.<br> And with those words singing in my ears,<br> I am to turn my back on you and go.<br> Yes, Robert. For how is it to end ?<br> What have we to look forward to and...<br> I love you.<br> And I want you for my wife.<br> Robert, I can't marry you.<br> How can I with...<br> Not today or tomorrow. Not this year perhaps, or next.<br> Perhaps not for years ro come.<br> I may never be able to marry you.<br> But what then ? If you remain to the last<br> beyond my reach, I shall die proud and happy...<br> ... in having spent a lifetime fighting<br> to gain the richest prize a man was ever offered...<br> No, no, no.<br> Robert, if we were to say goodbye today...<br> ... we should have nothing but beautiful memories<br> of each other to last to the end of our lives.<br> Is it you who are speaking ?<br> What do you mean ?<br> Here's life.<br> Life offering us the best that life can give.<br> And you dare not grasp at it<br> for fear that it will turn to dust in your hand.<br> I don't know you, I never thought you were a coward.<br> A coward ?<br> Yes, Robert, I'm a coward.<br> A coward through and through.<br> But it's not myself that am afraid.<br> I know that, my dear.<br> What's another disaster, great or small,<br> to me who have known it would disaster all my life ?<br> But you're a fighter. You were born for victory and triumph.<br> Oh, what if disaster came to you through me ?<br> Yes. A fighter. But I'm sick of fighting alone.<br> I need a comrade in arms to fight beside me.<br> But not one already wounded in the battle.<br> Wounded but not defeated. Undaunted. Unbroken.<br> What finer comrade could a man ask for ?<br> But Robert...<br> No, no.<br> But Robert.<br> No.<br> Dear Uncle Edward, don't you think<br> that your attitude about love and marriage...<br> I repeat that I do not care to discuss that subject.<br> Of course, dear Uncle Edward. Of course.<br> You aren't angry with me, are you ?<br> Certainly not, child.<br> Then why that gloomy frown ?<br> Sit down.<br> There.<br> There. All gone.<br> Oh, come, come, my pet.<br> If my children were as bright and open and affectionate as you are...<br> I should be a much happier man.<br> You mustn't say such things or they'll hate me.<br> You're a very charming little person.<br> Anything wrong in that ?<br> I didn't say so.<br> What's that scent you've got on ?<br> Scent ? Me ?<br> Don't you like it ?<br> I abominate scent as a rule, but yours is different.<br> Nice ?<br> It's delicate and subtle.<br> Still, I'd prefer you not to use it.<br> Why ?<br> Never mind.<br> Oh, uncle, you're a darling.<br> You call me bright, and open, and affectionate...<br> ... charming, and fragrant. All within a few minutes.<br> You may kiss me.<br> You know who's upstairs, Uncle Edward ?<br> Mr. Robert Browning, the poet.<br> Isn't that thrilling ?<br> I see nothing particularly thrilling in it.<br> Mr. Browning's respect for my daughter's intellect<br> seems to justify continuation of their friendship ?<br> Oh, yes. Such a nice intellectual friendship.<br> Two poets.<br> My, my, wouldn't it be frightfully interesting<br> if only dear Flush could speak ?<br> Not as interesting as if you could keep silent.<br> Oh, I'm just joking. And besides, I know that in his great big heart<br> Uncle Edward is really on the side of romance.<br> In the part of true love and all that.<br> What do you mean ?<br> If you could just have seen her face light up<br> when Mr. Browning's name was announced.<br> Bella, you...<br> Isn't it beautiful ?<br> Yes, miss, them wisteria is most certainly beautiful.<br> Isn't it though.<br> Oh, is that Mr. Browning over there ?<br> Shouldn't be at all surprised, miss.<br> Miss Barrett, I believe.<br> How do you do, Mr. Browning ?<br> How do you do ?<br> How do you do, Flush ?<br> Wilson ?<br> Isn't this a coincidence ?<br> We were just enjoying the beautiful wisteria<br> But it's much more exquisite over there.<br> I'm afraid, however, you shall have to go on foot.<br> Miss Ba, you mustn't.<br> Miss Wilson, I'm perfectly able to walk any distance.<br> If you would care to go with me...<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Wilson, would you wait here ?<br> And you too, Flush, dear.<br> Miss Ba, what would the master say ?<br> When my father returns to town<br> I shall be very pleased to tell him myself.<br> Shall we ?<br> Greatest of pleasure.<br> You'll pardon us, Flush.<br> Oh, it's so beautiful.<br> I'm delighted that you like it.<br> You can't imagine the difficulty I had<br> in getting that particular tree to grow that particular position.<br> And as for the sunlight, well, my dear, you won't believe the trouble I have with the sun.<br> It just won't stay still a minute.<br> So you got the sun to stay there just for me.<br> Oh, it was nothing at all, I assure you.<br> Wait until after we're married.<br> Please, Robert. Not today.<br> Let's just have today as a day of nonconsequential subjects.<br> Agreed.<br> Now, in here we have some very rare specimens.<br> The choicest and most exotic beauties in the floral kingdom.<br> For instance,<br> ... here we have the Orchidaceae Stictophyllum.<br> How exquisite.<br> Here, by a curious coincidence, we have two chairs.<br> Also very rare.<br> And here, my dear, you have a man who loves you.<br> Also very rare.<br> Very.<br> Has it got any feathers ?<br> No !<br> A tiger ?<br> No. No.<br> A dragon ?<br> No.<br> Think of something you're more afraid of<br> than anything else in the world.<br> Hm. Is is a gggg..girl.<br> I know ! It's papa !<br> Yes !<br> Listen, Ba.<br> Do you remember that, Ba ?<br> Yes, dear.<br> You wrote the words and I always loved it.<br> Yes, dear.<br> Let BBBBa play it.<br> I haven't played it in years.<br> My arm, madame.<br> Make way for the prima donna.<br> I'll turn the pages for you.<br> Oh, you're making me nervous.<br> Henrietta, dear, you should really play this.<br> No, darling, you play it.<br> Oh, I don't think I seem to remember it.<br> Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine...<br> ... to lie along with thine ?<br> As a little stone in a running stream...<br> ... it seems to lie and pine.<br> Now drop the poor pale hand, Dear,<br> ... unfit to plight with thine.<br> Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine...<br> ... to lie alone with thine ?<br> That's lovely, Ba.<br> Look at Henrietta, she's cccrying.<br> I just think it's so lovely seeing Ba sing again.<br> Bless you, dear.<br> Sing it again, Ba.<br> Yes, do.<br> I will if you all join me. Will you ?<br> Yes.<br> Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine...<br> ... to lie along with thine ?<br> As a little stone in a running stream...<br> ... it seems to lie and pine.<br> Now drop the poor pale hand, Dear,<br> ... unfit to plight with thine.<br> Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine...<br> ... to lie alone with thine ?<br> Good heavens, you'll be a success.<br> No...<br> Come on, let's have another game.<br> Its my turn to go out.<br> Beg your pardon, Miss Elizabeth.<br> This letter's just come. Special letter just brought.<br> It's from papa.<br> But he was to return tomorrow.<br> Perhaps he's been detained.<br> Do you think so ?<br> Oh.<br> What is it ?<br> "This is to let you know that<br> we shall be leaving London within a fortnight...<br> I've taken a furnished house at Bookham in Surrey,<br> six miles from the nearest railroad station...<br> You will benefit by the country air<br> and complete seclusion of your new surroundings."<br> Hurry up, aren't you ready yet ?<br> Oh, poor Henrietta.<br> We mustn't let her know.<br> Poor Surtees Cook.<br> "I have thought for some time now<br> that your present feverishly restless mode of living in London will, if continued...<br> ... affect you harmfully both physically and morally..."<br> ... my feverishly restless mode of living...<br> ... no wonder he doesn't describe me as a recklessly dissipated woman..<br> "You will inform your brothers and sisters of my decision<br> and tell them that I decline absolutely to discuss it when I return home."<br> He doesn't say when.<br> Oh, Ba, you poor darling.<br> He made my going to Italy impossible<br> and now we are to be cut off from any little pleasures we find here.<br> I see that he finishes up with the characteristic touch of humor.<br> Humor ?<br> He signs himself "your loving papa".<br> You see what this means ?<br> Yes.<br> Perhaps better than you do.<br> Oh, you're wrong. You don't know papa as I do.<br> He's growing jealous of my life here.<br> My pleasures and my friends...<br> and I'm slowly and surely to be parted from them.<br> Oh, Robert, it will soon be made impossible for me to see you at all.<br> This precious letter of your father's<br> means a great deal more that you as yet haven't been able to grasp.<br> Great deal more ?<br> It means that you will be in Italy before the month is out.<br> Italy ?<br> Yes. And with me.<br> Robert !<br> It means we must be married at once.<br> Do you know what you're saying ?<br> Yes, I know what I'm saying and I repeat it.<br> We must be married at once.<br> Oh, Robert. It's no use deceiving ourselves.<br> It's not only papa who stands between us.<br> It's I.<br> It's I.<br> However stronger<br> I may become I shall always remain an invalid.<br> Oh, Robert, as your wife, dear,<br> I should be haunted day and night by...<br> by thoughts of all the glorious things<br> you would have done but for me.<br> Freedom, adventure...<br> ... and passionate love. I...<br> ... I could never really satisfy.<br> No. No, listen.<br> Oh, Robert.<br> I should be haunted by the ghosts of your unborn children.<br> When I read that letter my world seemed to fall to pieces.<br> But now I thank God that it came while I was still free.<br> I have the strength to shake hands and say goodbye.<br> On the whole I think this will be our best plan of campaign.<br> We'll meet at Marylebone Church on Saturday<br> and be married quietly some time in the morning.<br> I'll see about the license at once and interview the vicar.<br> Robert !<br> The packet leaves the Royal Pier on Saturdays at midnight.<br> We must catch the 8 o'clock express at Vauxhall.<br> It arrives at Southhampton at 11.<br> Dear.<br> Come along, come along.<br> And I always thought that papa<br> was the most overbearing man in the world.<br> And yet you've known me for quite some time now.<br> I know, darling, but I mustn't give way.<br> I mustn't, I daren't.<br> There's one other thing, my darling.<br> You can't possibly travel without a maid.<br> Do you think Wilson would be willing to come abroad with us ?<br> Robert...<br> Have you ever thought that<br> my strenght may break down in the journey ?<br> Yes.<br> So as I were to die on your hands.<br> Are you afraid, Ba ?<br> Afraid,<br> You know I'd rather die with you beside me<br> than live a hundred lives without you.<br> But how would you feel if I were to die like that ?<br> And what would the world say of you ?<br> I should be branded as a little better than a murderer.<br> What I should feel, I leave you to imagine.<br> And yet you ask me to come with you ?<br> Yes.<br> I'm prepared to risk your life and much more than mine.<br> Get you out of that dreadful house<br> and into the sunshine, and to have you...<br> ... for my wife.<br> You love me like that ?<br> I love you like that.<br> Robert.<br> Yes, dear.<br> Will you...<br> will you give me a little time ?<br> Time is short, my dear.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Your father is expected back...<br> Not till next week<br> You shall know before then.<br> You promise me that ?<br> I promise.<br> Oh, Miss Ba, I was that worried about you.<br> Out in the rain and everything.<br> Rain ? Oh, yes.<br> Quite a shower.<br> The sun's shining and lovely now.<br> Contrary thing.<br> Oh, is anything wrong, miss ?<br> Wrong ?<br> No, no.<br> Ba ! Oh, Ba, you must see him at once, you simply must.<br> Him ?<br> He's in full regimentals. He's just been to St James<br> to receive whatever you call it,<br> ... his adjunctancy or something, from Queen Victoria herself.<br> Oh, he's wonderful, he's gorgeous.<br> I'm talking about Captain Cook, you know.<br> Yes, so I've gathered.<br> Darling, I'm swooning out now.<br> I've just been out and I'm quite tired.<br> But some other time will do just as well.<br> No, no. I told you, he's in full uniform.<br> Oh, he's just on the landing outside.<br> Please see him, Ba.<br> All right darling, bring him in.<br> Come up, Surtees.<br> Careful or you'll wreck yourself.<br> There.<br> Attention !<br> March !<br> Captain Surtees Cook, Ba.<br> My sister Elizabeth.<br> Your servant, Miss Barrett.<br> Captain Cook.<br> Twice honored in one day, you know.<br> First by Her Majesty, then by you, Miss Bartett.<br> Really, I don't know what I've done to deserve it.<br> That's right, you've just come from the palace, haven't you ?<br> I've never seen the Queen.<br> Tell me, what is she like ?<br> Very little lady, mam.<br> But royal every inch of her.<br> Surtees, you haven't got your sword on.<br> Not etiquette, as I told you, to wear it indoors.<br> Oh, bother. I shall get it. I want Ba to see you in full war paint.<br> Where did you leave it ?<br> Well, it's in the hall.<br> I'll fetch it.<br> No, look here, Miss Barrett doesn't want to...<br> But indeed I do, Captain Cook.<br> I don't think I've ever seen<br> an officer in full war paint before.<br> Indeed ?<br> Won't you sit down.<br> Oh, yes, Wilson, I think you'd better take Flush out.<br> He always gets so excited<br> when there are a few people in the room.<br> Oh, yes, of course.<br> Miss Barrett...<br> Yes ?<br> Miss Barrett...<br> Yes, Captain Cook ?<br> I say, Miss Barrett...<br> You want to tell me something about Henrietta, don't you ?<br> Just so, Miss Barrtett, just so. Exactly.<br> You know, Miss Barrett, you know...<br> Yes, Captain Cook, I know.<br> And believe me, you have my heartfelt sympathy.<br> Thank you, oh, thank you, it's more than I deserve.<br> Thank you, Miss Barrett.<br> Never was such a girl, you know. Henrietta, I mean.<br> I don't know what I've done to deserve it.<br> Captain Cook...<br> Did he tell you something while I was out of the room ?<br> Don't tell me he really managed to get it out.<br> Well, perhaps not quite...<br> Well, still you know, like most ladies, quick in the uptake.<br> Yes, I understood.<br> Listen, my dear. Don't ever let anything<br> keep you from doing what you think in your heart is right.<br> Remember that.<br> Quite aware I'm not much of a match, Miss Barrett.<br> Poor man you know.<br> Surtees, let me buckle on your sword.<br> Oh, I say...<br> Ba thinks that poets are the flower of manhood,<br> a certain poet at any rate.<br> I mean to show her that she's mistaken.<br> You've got it wrong, you know.<br> I have ?<br> The sword hangs from the left hip, you know.<br> Why ?<br> Well, it's sort of...<br> Papa !<br> You're back sooner than I expected, papa.<br> I don't think I have the privilege of this gentleman's acquaintance.<br> Captain Cook, may I introduce my father.<br> Papa, Captain Surtees Cook.<br> Your servant, sir.<br> Captain Cook is a great friend of George and Octavius.<br> Indeed.<br> My sons are very rarely at home at this hour of the day.<br> The fact is, sir, I was just passing the house and...<br> ... I thought I'd look in, you know,<br> in the off chance of finding one of them in and all that.<br> I see.<br> Captain Cook has just come from Buckingham Palace.<br> And Henrietta thought I should like<br> to see him in all the splendor of his regimentals.<br> Indeed.<br> Nothing much to look at, of course, sir, but...<br> ladies like a bit of color and I thought...<br> By Jove, it must be getting late...<br> It is 19 and a half minutes past twelve.<br> By Jove, it's high time that I was moving.<br> Goodbye, Miss Barrett.<br> Goodbye, Captain.<br> Goodbye, Miss Henrietta.<br> I'll see you out.<br> Your servant, sir.<br> I'm seeing Captain Cook to the door.<br> The servants will attend to that.<br> This house is fast becoming a rendez-vous for half London.<br> This was the first time I had the pleasure of meeting Captain Cook.<br> Indeed, but I infer from what I saw as I came into the room ...<br> ... that Henrietta's acquaintance<br> has a somewhat longer standing, or am I mistaken ?<br> I've known Captain Cook for some time now.<br> Oh, since when has it been your custom to buckle on his accoutrement ?<br> I'd never seen him in full uniform before.<br> And I think it improbable that you will see<br> him in full uniform or otherwise in the future.<br> But papa...<br> Captain Cook to be forbidden to visit us<br> because I helped him on with his sword....<br> You received my letter ?<br> Yes, papa.<br> What has just happened<br> fully confirms me in the wisdom of my decision.<br> Fortunately our new home is so far from town<br> that your London friends are not likely to trouble us.<br> Our new home ? I don't understand.<br> Are we leaving Wimpole Street ?<br> I have taken a house in Bookham in Surrey.<br> Why ?<br> I am not in the habit of accounting<br> for my actions to anyone, least of all to my children.<br> But one thing I've the right to ask you, papa.<br> Is Captain Cook to be forbidden the house because of what just happened ?<br> I understood you to say Captain Cook was George's friend and Octavius'.<br> Yes, and my friend too.<br> Ah... come here.<br> Yes, papa ?<br> Come here !<br> What is this man to you ?<br> I told you, he's a friend of ours.<br> What is he to you ?<br> A friend.<br> Is that all ?<br> Yes.<br> You liar !<br> Papa !<br> Papa, let me go.<br> What is this man to you ? Answer me.<br> Please, papa, please.<br> Answer me !<br> No. No.<br> Answer me !<br> He's... he's...<br> Oh, papa, I love him !<br> Ah...<br> Oh, you... you... you...<br> You... you... !<br> Papa ! Papa !<br> Let her go ! I won't have it !<br> Let her go at once.<br> You and this filthiness !<br> I've known that Henrietta loved Captain Cook<br> for some time and I've given her all my strength.<br> You dare to tell me !<br> Yes !<br> I would have given her<br> all my help too if I had it to give.<br> I'll deal with you later.<br> Get up !<br> Papa, listen to me, please...<br> I'm not a bad girl, I swear to you I'm not.<br> I know I've deceived you, I'm sorry.<br> I love him. I love him.<br> He's a good man. It can't be wrong to love him.<br> I want love. I can't live without love.<br> Papa, remember how you loved mama and she loved you<br> and you'll understand and pity me...<br> Get up !<br> Sit there !<br> How long has this been going on ?<br> Do you hear me ? How long have you been carrying on with this fellow ?<br> I've known Captain Cook for over a year.<br> You've been with him often ?<br> Yes,<br> Alone ?<br> Yes.<br> Where ?<br> We met in the park, and...<br> In here ?<br> Yes.<br> Here and alone ?<br> Have you been with him in this house alone ?<br> Yes.<br> So clandestine meetings under my own roof<br> and abetted by one whom I beleived to be holy, chaste and good...<br> How dare you, papa.<br> Now listen to me.<br> Unless you give me your solemn word that you will neither...<br> ... see nor have any communication with this man again,<br> ... you will leave my house at once<br> as you are with nothing but the clothes you have on.<br> Once outside my doors,<br> you can go to perdition any way you please.<br> But you will never be admitted again as long as I live.<br> I think you know I never go back on my word.<br> You have your choice. Take it.<br> Is it nothing to you<br> that I shall hate you for this to the end of my life ?<br> Less than nothing.<br> Will you give me your word neither to see<br> nor to have any communication with this man again ?<br> I have no choice.<br> Elizabeth, give me your Bible.<br> My Bible belonged to mama.<br> I can't have it used for such a purpose.<br> Give me your Bible.<br> No.<br> You refuse ?<br> Yes.<br> Come here.<br> Place your hand upon the Book.<br> Repeat after me.<br> I give you my solemn word...<br> ... that I shall neither see<br> nor have any communication with Captain Cook again.<br> I give you my solemn word that I will neither see...<br> nor have any communication with Captain Cook again.<br> You will now go your room<br> and remain there until you have my permission to leave it.<br> Henrietta.<br> Henrietta.<br> Do you remember what I told you ?<br> Just what did that mean ?<br> I was reminding Henrietta what I told her a short time ago.<br> I begged her to fight for her happiness.<br> You dare !<br> Yes, yes !<br> For years I've crushed down my doubts.<br> I tried to persuade myself that in spite of all you loved us.<br> But at last I've been forced to face the truth.<br> You're like a shadow over our lives.<br> I command you to be silent.<br> I won't stand by and see you wreck her life if I can save it.<br> You may be too strong for me, but at least I'll try.<br> I'll try...<br> Elizabeth !<br> You might have had the love of all your children.<br> But instead you have fear.<br> Fear and hatred.<br> Elizabeth !<br> Hatred, I tell you. Hatred and mine too. Hatred.<br> It will be hard for me to forget what you have said.<br> I shall leave you under my extreme displeasure.<br> When you have repented your wickedness<br> and are ready to ask for God's forgiveness,<br> ... and mine, you may send for me.<br> Come in.<br> Wilson, shut the door, please.<br> Wilson...<br> Are you my friend ?<br> Your friend ?<br> Yes, I'm very much in need of friendship and help at the moment.<br> Oh, I'm that fond of you<br> I'd do anything to help you, miss Ba.<br> Good.<br> I'm going to marry Mr. Browning.<br> Marry ?<br> Shhh.<br> Does he know ?<br> No, and he mustn't. Nobody must.<br> I should just think not indeed.<br> Oh, Miss Ba.<br> I'm that glad.<br> After we're married we're going to Italy.<br> And Mr. Browning would like to know if you'll come with us.<br> To Italy ?<br> Yes. Will you come ?<br> Well, miss, I don't see as how I can help meself.<br> Not that I hold to foreign parts, I don't, but...<br> husband or no husband,<br> you'd never get to Italy alive without me.<br> Thank you, Wilson.<br> Now, I want you to take a letter right to Mr. Browning.<br> You'll have to take a cab at once.<br> A cab ?<br> Yes, go and get all your things.<br> I'll have this finished by the time you're ready.<br> Hurry !<br> But Miss Ba...<br> ... is it to be at once ?<br> No, probably not for a month or so.<br> Be quick, though.<br> Yes, miss.<br> But Miss Ba...<br> If it's not to be for a month...<br> Yes, Wilson, I know I'm absurd...<br> but I made up this courage.<br> Besides, I believe Mr. Browning will be glad to get my letter.<br> Oh, I'm sure he will, miss.<br> Miss Wilson, has anything happened ?<br> What is it ?<br> Miss Ba sent this for you, sir.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, it's all right, sir.<br> Wilson, I...<br> I was afraid that... perhaps...<br> If you don't mind, sir...<br> I think it's splendid.<br> Oh, thank you, Wilson, thank you.<br> Thank you, Wilson.<br> If you don't mind, sir.<br> Wilson, I knew she'd do it.<br> I had no right to be afraid.<br> I wasn't really afraid.<br> Oh, no, sir.<br> Wilson, do you realize that you are the bearer<br> of the greatest good tidings since<br> they brought the good news from ------ ?<br> You wait here, Wilson.<br> I'm going upstairs and tell the good news to my mother.<br> I'm going to tell it to everybody.<br> Oh I wouldn't do that, sir.<br> You wait here and then we'll go back<br> together in triumph to Wimpole Street.<br> Perhaps we'd better have music, a band or something.<br> You're not to do that, sir.<br> The master's come home.<br> What's that ?<br> Mr. Barrett, sir. He came home.<br> Oh, Miss Ba.<br> Shhh.<br> Oh, Miss Ba, you can't imagine...<br> What did he say ?<br> Well, miss, he's a most unusual man.<br> There he stood giving me orders.<br> Telling me what you and me was to do.<br> Really, miss, I don't know what your married life is going to be like.<br> Wilson, was he pleased when he read the letter ?<br> He was that pleased, miss.<br> What did he say, how did he look ?<br> I want to know everything.<br> Well, miss... He couldn't say a word at first.<br> He seemd all kind of choked up, like...<br> Oh, Wilson.<br> Wilson, he was happy that I...<br> Yes, miss, he was that happy. You should have seen his face.<br> And then he started running<br> around with timetables and those things.<br> And he says you are to wear<br> your ordinary travelling clothes to the church.<br> Church ?<br> Yes, miss, you're going to be married tonight.<br> But, Wilson. That's absurd.<br> Tonight ? How can we ?<br> I don't know. But we're going to.<br> He's going to get a vicar and a special license.<br> And as soon as we're finished packing,<br> we're to meet him at the church.<br> So I might just as well start packing.<br> But Wilson, how can we ?<br> Don't ask me, ask him.<br> What dresses are you going to pack, miss ?<br> Wilson, do you want to drive me mad. You know we can't.<br> He says you can.<br> Oh, miss. There's a lot I'd give to be here...<br> ... when the master finds out you've gone and got married.<br> Don't Wilson, don't. The very thought terrifies me.<br> Wilson, put back those things and give me time to think.<br> You know it's out of the question.<br> I'm not prepared and I...<br> Wilson ! Put back those things.<br> Oh, miss, you did give me a turn.<br> Be quiet.<br> Ba !<br> What on earth is the matter ?<br> Why, nothing.<br> Nothing. It's just...<br> ... it's all been so upsetting.<br> I don't believe that's all.<br> Look at Wilson.<br> You've startled us.<br> Wilson, will you come back in a little while ?<br> Is there something you want to say to me, dear ?<br> Yes.<br> Papa threatened to turn me out of the house<br> unless I swore on the Bible not to write or see Surtees.<br> Well, I'm going to break that Bible oath.<br> Are you, dear ?<br> Yes, and I shall glory in breaking it.<br> I shall see Surtees every day when we leave.<br> And when we're in the country I shall write to him.<br> And if papa asks me, I'll go out of my way to lie to him.<br> I see. Why do you tell me this ?<br> Because I want you to say<br> that I'm a wicked, deceitful, perjured, loose woman...<br> ... so that I can fling the words back in your face.<br> Oh, Ba.<br> Ba, darling, I didn't mean that.<br> I'm not myself.<br> I'm all love and hate.<br> I don't know which is the worse torture.<br> Oh, my dear. You think I don't understand, but I do.<br> I do.<br> And I implore you, dear, never lose hope.<br> Never lose courage. Never.<br> The master.<br> Ba, there is something.<br> You're as white as a sheet.<br> What is it ? Is there anything I can do ?<br> No, no. Don't speak, don't ask me anything.<br> You know nothing, you understand ? Nothing, nothing.<br> What's the matter with that woman ?<br> Wilson ?<br> Yes. And you.<br> Nothing, papa.<br> Where have you been ?<br> Nowhere.<br> Where are you going ?<br> To Aunt Hedley's.<br> Is that the truth ?<br> Yes.<br> Remember your oath.<br> Yes.<br> Are you going to keep it ?<br> Yes.<br> I want to speak to your sister. You may go.<br> Do you know why I've come back ?<br> No, papa.<br> Because I cannot bear to be estranged from you.<br> You should have come to me to beg<br> my forgiveness for your wicked and cruel words.<br> But in spite of my sense of right<br> and justice and duty I had to come to you.<br> And I despise myself for coming.<br> I despise myself, I hate myself...<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> Oh, papa, can't you see,<br> won't you ever see that strength may be weakness ?<br> And that your sense of justice,<br> duty and right are all mistaken and wrong ?<br> It's been my heavy cross that those whom I was given to guide and rule<br> have always fought against the right which I knew to be the right.<br> And was in duty bound to impose upon them, even you.<br> Even your mother<br> My mother ?<br> Yes, your mother.<br> You, my eldest child, were born of love and only love.<br> But the others, long before they came,<br> love died out and fear took its place.<br> No, no...<br> Fear. And all because I saw the right and did it.<br> Not that she ever opposed me ever once.<br> Oh, dear God, what she must have suffered.<br> Ba, my dear, don't, don't.<br> I shouldn't have spoken about it.<br> Take your hands from your face.<br> Don't look at me like that. You don't understand, how should you ?<br> You know nothing of the brutal tyranny of the senses and how<br> even the strongest and best are driven by it to hell.<br> Would you have abetted your sister...<br> Henrietta's in love !<br> You dare speak of it in the same breath ?<br> Her, love ?<br> You ignorant little fool,<br> what do you know about love ?<br> Love. Desire.<br> It's time a little reality were brought into your dream of life.<br> I won't listen to you.<br> You must ! You shall !<br> Do you suppose I should have guarded my house<br> like a dragon from this so-called love...<br> ... if I hadn't known from my own life<br> all it entails of degradation and remorse ?<br> With the help of God and through years<br> of tormenting abstinence I strangled it in myself...<br> ... and so long as I have breath in my body<br> I'll keep it away from those I was given to protect.<br> Do you understand me ?<br> Yes.<br> I understand you.<br> I understand you.<br> Very well.<br> This has been a painful necessity<br> but I had to speak plainly lest your very innocence...<br> ... should smirch the purity I'm utterly<br> resolved to maintain in my household.<br> You're cold as ice. Why are you trembling ?<br> I shall never forget what you have said.<br> For the love of heaven, my darling,<br> don't let this raise any further barrier between us.<br> I cannot play the coward's part<br> and take the easier way and shirk my duty.<br> I'd rather be hated by the whole world<br> than gain love that way.<br> Oh, papa, you don't know how I pity you.<br> Pity ?<br> I don't want your pity.<br> If ever I should lose you or your love...<br> My darling, in our new home<br> we shall draw close to each other again.<br> Nothing and no one can come between us,<br> my child, my darling.<br> You want me to be happy.<br> The only happiness I shall ever know is all yours to give or take.<br> You must look up to me and depend on me and lean on me.<br> You must share your thoughts with me,<br> your hopes, your fears, your prayers...<br> I can't bear it, I can't bear any more.<br> Let me go papa. Please, let me go !<br> Forgive me, my dear, I was carried away.<br> Shall I leave you now ?<br> Please.<br> Shall I see you again tonight ?<br> Not tonight.<br> I shall pray for you.<br> Pray for me tonight ?<br> Yes.<br> Pray for me tonight if you will.<br> Did he find anything out ?<br> Wilson, I'm going. I must.<br> Now, at once.<br> Oh, Miss Ba, what's happened ? But we haven't packed.<br> Well, we must go without.<br> But we won't have as much as a nightgown.<br> We can buy them.<br> Miss Ba...<br> I can't stay here, Wilson.<br> I'm frightened. I'm frightened.<br> Fetch your cloak and bonnet.<br> But, Miss Ba, if he did catch us...<br> He can't stop me. I don't belong to him anymore.<br> He could kill me, but he can't stop me.<br> Oh, Miss Ba, I daren't just now. I daren't.<br> Let's go to the other room.<br> Oh, we can't do that.<br> Wilson, I must. That's all I know. I must go.<br> To Robert.<br> But, miss Ba...<br> Wilson, until today I've never really known my father.<br> I've even hoped I might confide in him,<br> but now I know t would be hopeless.<br> He'd crush me as he crushed my mother.<br> Oh, miss Ba...<br> He's cruel, Wilson, cruel and pitiless and I'm afraid.<br> If you want to draw back<br> you needn't ever reproach yourself.<br> But I must go to Mr. Browning now.<br> I'll fetch my cloak and bonnet at once, miss.<br> Wilson.<br> Oh, miss Ba.<br> They're all down to dinner now, miss.<br> The master's just gone in.<br> All right, Wilson.<br> Come, Flush.<br> Henrietta !<br> I'm going to call Arabel, papa.<br> Take your place and be seated without her.<br> Almighty Father, giver of all good gifts...<br> ... who of thy thy divine providence<br> has provided thy unworthy servants...<br> ... with all things necessary to their bodily sustenance.<br> Grant, we beseech thee, spiritual grace...<br> ... that we may enjoy it in<br> quietness of spirit as proof of thy bounty...<br> ... and render unto Thee<br> most humble and hearty thank. Amen<br> Amen.<br> For heaven's sake, what is it ?<br> Tell us at once !<br> She's gone. To be married.<br> What do you mean ?<br> Arabel !<br> Arabel, pull yourself together at once !<br> Where's Ba ? Answer me, where's Ba ?<br> She's gone. She left this note. Read it.<br> It's true.<br> It's true.<br> She sends us her love<br> and will write to all of us from Italy.<br> Italy.<br> Look !<br> This letter is for papa.<br> Papa.<br> What's to be done ?<br> Someone must give him Ba's letter.<br> Let me. I should love to.<br> What is the meaning of this ?<br> Who was making that hideous noise ?<br> Where is Elizabeth ?<br> You hear me.<br> Where is your sister ?<br> She left you this letter.<br> Left me ?<br> What do you mean ?<br> She left a letter for Arabel.<br> And this for you.<br> Oh, papa, you must forgive her.<br> Not for her sake, but for yours.<br> I thought I hated you, but I don't.<br> I pity you.<br> And if you have any pity for yourself, forgive her.<br> Elizabeth.<br> Yes, yes, her dog.<br> Yes, I'll have her dog.<br> Octavius.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Her dog must be destroyed at once.<br> What ?<br> You will take it to the vet tonight.<br> Do you understand me ? Tonight.<br> Do you understand me ?<br> Heavens, I don't see what the ppp...poor little beast has done.<br> Do you understand me ?<br> In her letter, Ba writes that she has taken Flush with her.<br> For as much as Robert and Elizabeth<br> have consented together in holy wedlock...<br> ... and have witnessed the same before God and this company...<br> ... I pronounce that they be man and wife together.<br> In the name of the Father,<br> and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost...<br> Amen.<br> God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost...<br> Bless, preserve and keep<br> that ye may so live together in this life...<br> ... that in the world to come<br> ye may have life everlasting.<br> Amen.<br>
