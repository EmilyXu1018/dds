                        It was the nicest little whorehouse<br> you ever saw.<br> It lay about a mile outside the city limits,<br> so everybody could feel real friendly.<br> Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace picked it out<br> for Miss Wulla Jean in 1910,...<br> ...and she moved there with her girls from<br> over the hardware store on main street.<br> 0h, the little house lay<br> In a green Texas glade<br> Where the trees were as coolin'<br> As fresh lemonade<br> Soft summer wind<br> had a trace of perfume<br> And a fan was turnin' in every room<br> Twenty fans were turnin',<br> they were turnin'<br> Twenty fans were turnin' in every room<br> Fevers were a-burnin',<br> they were burnin'<br> And they had to have<br> a way to cool down<br> Right from the beginning,<br> the little house was special,...<br> ...like a home away from home.<br> Miss Wulla Jean put a Pianola<br> in the parlour to sorta help break the ice.<br> A fella could ask a girl to dance<br> or, if he held back a little, she'd ask him.<br> And pretty soon they'd get<br> a little business goin'.<br> Two dollars' worth.<br> Yahoo!<br> It wasn't long before it became one of the<br> better-known pleasure palaces in Texas.<br> So much so that the fellas<br> who visited during World War I...<br> ...sent their sons back in World War I I.<br> The hospitality and friendliness<br> never changed,...<br> ...and neither did Miss Wulla Jean's<br> strict set of rules.<br> She liked her ladies, as she called 'em,...<br> ...to treat her customers real good,<br> but never in an unladylike way.<br> And she insisted that each girl<br> check her gentleman for the clap...<br> ...and wash him off<br> with soap and warm water.<br> Some of the fellas claimed that<br> that was the best part!<br> Oo-ee!<br> It was only durin' the Hoover Depression<br> that the little house had tough times.<br> Miss Wulla Jean put in a jukebox<br> to spark up business.<br> But it wasn't always easy in them days<br> to come up with hard cash.<br> (clucking)<br> Well, you just keep that in the bag...<br> ...and I'll take it out back<br> as soon as we're finished.<br> So for a while, as the story goes,...<br> ...the girls began acceptin'<br> poultry in trade.<br> 0ne bird, one lay.<br> And that's how the place got its name.<br> The Chicken Ranch.<br> Course, if you grew up<br> anywhere in Texas,...<br> ...you knew at an early age<br> they was sellin' somethin' out there,...<br> ...and it wasn't poultry.<br> Twenty fans were turnin',<br> they were turnin'<br> Twenty fans were turnin' in every room<br> Fevers were a-burnin',<br> they were burnin'<br> And they had to have<br> a way to cool down<br> Twenty fans were hummin',<br> they were hummin'<br> Twenty fans were hummin'<br> in every room<br> Customers were comin',<br> they were comin'<br> And they had to have<br> a way to cool down<br> (whooping)<br> Twenty fans were turnin',<br> they were turnin'<br> Twenty fans were turnin' in every room<br> Fevers were a-burnin',<br> they were burnin'<br> And they had to have<br> a way to cool down<br> Twenty fans were hummin',<br> they were hummin'<br> Twenty fans were hummin'<br> in every room<br> Customers were comin',<br> they were comin'<br> And they had to have<br> a way to cool down<br> Y'all come back now, you hear?<br> Yahoo!<br> Twenty fans were turnin',<br> they were turnin'<br> Twenty fans were turnin' in every room<br> Fevers were a-burnin',<br> they were burnin'<br> And they had to have<br> a way to cool down<br> Twenty fans were turnin',<br> they were turnin'<br> Twenty fans were turnin' in every room<br> Fevers were a-burnin',<br> they were burnin'<br> And they had to have<br> a way to cool down<br> Hallelujah<br> Hallelujah<br> For three generations, the Chicken Ranch<br> went peacefully about its business...<br> ...while the people in Gilbert<br> went about theirs.<br> That is, until about seven years ago.<br> I was a deputy back then,<br> workin' for Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd.<br> You wanted me to remind you<br> about your appointment.<br> That was right after I had lost<br> the fried chicken franchise,...<br> ...while Ed Earl had been sheriff<br> ever since old Jack Roy Wallace retired.<br> Everybody liked Ed Earl,<br> especially Ed Earl.<br> Course, he sure did know his job,<br> and he was a big influence on me.<br> Taught me everything I know.<br> He used to like to run a quiet town...<br> ...with plenty of time off for socialisin'<br> and coffee over at Dulcie Mae's Caf.<br> 0h, now and again there'd be a problem,<br> and we had some tough ones.<br> Like the time the mule<br> sat on Miss Modene's car.<br> (Miss Modene) He just buckled up his legs<br> and sat down.<br> She was really havin' a hissy fit,<br> but it didn't faze Ed Earl.<br> He just walked over to that jackass<br> and laid down the law.<br> You see, Ed Earl always<br> believed in talkin' first.<br> Cool reasonin', he used to tell me,<br> could solve any problem.<br> Course, he did have a bit of a temper.<br> Anyway, just about the time he became<br> sheriff, Miss Wulla Jean passed on.<br> She left the Chicken Ranch to her<br> favourite workin' girl, Mona Stangely,...<br> ...who saw the little house<br> as a Texas institution...<br> ...and aimed to keep it that way.<br> honky-tonk piano)<br> It's just a little-bitty<br> pissant country place<br> Ain't nothin' much to see<br> No drinkin' allowed<br> We get a nice quiet crowd<br> Plain as it can be<br> It's just a piddly, squattin'<br> old-time country place<br> Ain't nothin' too high-toned<br> Just lots of goodwill<br> And maybe one small thrill<br> But there's nothin' dirty goin' on<br> Nothin' dirty goin' on<br> We get simple farmers,<br> local businessmen<br> Congress folks from Austin,<br> young boys lookin' for sin<br> Now, we used to get<br> a lot of roughnecks<br> When the oil boom was high<br> But payday'd get a little rowdy<br> Thank God the field run dry<br> It's just a little-bitty<br> pissant country place<br> Nothin' much to see<br> No drinkin' allowed,<br> we get a nice quiet crowd<br> Plain as it can be<br> It's just a piddly, squattin'<br> old-time country place<br> Nothin' too

town caf<br> and say hi on the street<br> Mind your p's and q's and manners<br> And you don't need no other tools<br> Cos every girl that lives here<br> knows my special no-no rules<br> Yeah, every girl that lives here<br> knows Miss Mona's no-no rules<br> - Ruby Rae, start 'em.<br> Beds are not to be wallowed in<br> That's the kind of thing<br> that big fat lazy hogs do<br> - It don't make

You know Miss Mona.<br> Oh, yes, of course! We've met.<br> Mornin'.<br> - Good mornin'.<br> - Isn't this wonderful?<br> Miss Mona has just capped the goal<br> for the Little League fund campaign.<br> Oh, how nice!<br> Well, on behalf of my son and<br> his team-mates, I wanna thank you.<br> You tell 'em I'll be well repaid when<br> they take the championship next year.<br> - Goodbye, Rita.<br> - I'm sorry the sheriff wasn't here.<br> He went to Meritsville.<br> He'll be gone all afternoon.<br> Well, you tell him I said hi.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Bye.<br> - Hey, Miss Mona.<br> - How are you doin', Deputy Fred?<br> - It's nice to see you.<br> - Keepin' an eye on my place at night?<br> The sheriff's real particular<br> about security there.<br> Well, one of these nights,<br> you drop in.<br> My girls would love to show you<br> a little appreciation.<br> Shoot, Miss Mona!<br> You know I'm a married man.<br> Fred, you think the cows<br> don't appreciate the time off...<br> ...when a bull goes over<br> to another pasture?<br> Miss Mona!<br> - See you later, Miss Mona.<br> - OK. Goodbye.<br> - Damn it!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - You're in bed already.<br> - So?<br> So I told you a hundred times - watching<br> you get undressed is the best part.<br> The best part?<br> Well, maybe not the best part,<br> but in the top two.<br> Now, would I wanna disappoint<br> my little honey?<br> Whoo!<br> - I'm glad I was late.<br> - Me too!<br> You just hold your horses.<br> I got a surprise for you.<br> I went by the post office. I picked up<br> a package from Frederick's of Hollywood.<br> Just a little something sexy<br> I thought you'd like.<br> Little? It don't look little to me.<br> Well, it ain't a trainin' bra,<br> but I believe I can fill it out.<br> - I don't think you got any problem there.<br> - I'll be back with more.<br> (chuckles) You know, Mona,<br> I've known a lot of women in my life.<br> None of 'em have ever been<br> exciting to me like you are.<br> Really? Even after all these years<br> we've been meetin' like this?<br> I'll tell you something.<br> A year with you is like...<br> a minute of sheer happiness.<br> Well, now, that is just about the sweetest<br> thing anybody ever said to me.<br> I know.<br> You know, honey...<br> ...you bring out the... romantic in me.<br> Ta-da!<br> Whoo! You did that real fast.<br> I've had a lot of practice<br> gettin' in and out of my clothes.<br> How do you like the outfit?<br> Hot damn. Makes me feel real sexy!<br> Whoo!<br> Well, you don't look real sexy.<br> - I look like I always look.<br> - That's just it.<br> It's them damn droopy boxer drawers.<br> I just hate the looks of them.<br> - I've worn boxer shorts for years!<br> - And they look like it.<br> These are a brand-new pair.<br> I don't know what you're talkin' about.<br> People tell me I have<br> a real sexy quality about me.<br> Well, you do,<br> but them boxer shorts don't.<br> But when I was gettin' me some<br> sexy things, I thought about you.<br> They have a his-and-hers department...<br> ...and I thought you might<br> wanna try that on for size.<br> What the hell is it? A Japanese slingshot?<br> No, it's Jockey shorts<br> with little silver snaps on the side.<br> Mm. "Little" is the key word here.<br> They are real little.<br> A guy could hurt himself wearin' those.<br> I don't think so, thank you very much.<br> Ed Earl, I paid $20 for these, plus<br> postage, and I want you to wear 'em.<br> - You paid $20 for these?<br> - Yes!<br> Well, you got screwed.<br> - Come on, Ed Earl!<br> - No!<br> If they look half as good as I think,<br> you ain't gonna wear 'em but a second.<br> Maybe less.<br> - They're ridiculous.<br> - They're sexy.<br> No, no, no!<br> Well, fine! I'm gettin' dressed<br> and goin' home.<br> Well, fine! I'm goin' in the bathroom<br> and... put these on.<br> Be like puttin' two bowlin' balls<br> in a marble bag.<br> Braggin', braggin', braggin'.<br> - Well, I saw Dulcie Mae in town today.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> I guess you'll be goin' there<br> for Thanksgivin' dinner.<br> - Don't I always?<br> - You better check that turkey of hers...<br> ...because there's a hook in there that's<br> gonna drag your ass to a weddin' chapel.<br> (chuckles) No way.<br> I don't believe in matrimony.<br> It screws up a relationship.<br> Amen to that, Ed Earl.<br> - Ready?<br> - Oh, I'm always ready.<br> Well, hellfire!

What do you want?<br> The mayor wants to speak to you. Rita's<br> been callin' all over the county for you.<br> - He wants a meeting right away.<br> - Can't it wait?<br> - You mean till after your shower?<br> - Mm...<br> You go to your radio.<br> Tell him I'll be there when I get there.<br> Nothing can be that important<br> that it can't wait.<br> Right, Sheriff.<br> Nice man, but dumb.<br> Mona?

Miss Mona was<br> at the back, knockin' on the screen door.<br> She was in a hurry,<br> but just dropped by to give you this.<br> It's a Japanese slingshot.<br> Well, look at that! At last!<br> OK, Rufus. What's on your mind?<br> Something with serious implications<br> to the health of this town! Tell him, CJ!<br> I have this friend that works<br> in a TV station down in Houston.<br> He tipped me off that Melvin P Thorpe's<br> plannin' an expos on the Chicken Ranch.<br> - Who?<br> - Melvin P Thorpe.<br> He's that crazy consumer advocate.<br> Has a report on the late night news.<br> He's got a new show once a week:<br> The Watchdog Report. It's on tonight.<br> The Chicken Ranch on TV.<br> Now, come on, fellas.<br> - Television is a family medium.<br> - But he's a sensationalist.<br> He shows up every time a consumer has<br> a complaint. He's a menace to business.<br> He's that fella that put the peanuts<br> back in the chocolate bar.<br> What?<br> He made the makers of<br> the Peanut Delight candy bar admit...<br> ...that they put less peanuts in than<br> they said. He made 'em change their ways.<br> - Sounds like a tough customer.<br> - He has a lot of influence.<br> If he brings cameras<br> to the Chicken Ranch...<br> Come on, Rufus!<br> I'll make some phone calls.<br> I got a little influence<br> around this state myself.<br> Well, it's no use talkin' to me<br> about it, Sheriff.<br> Melvin P Thorpe is now the biggest<br> attraction at this station.<br> High ratings. Lots of letters.<br> He doesn't listen to anybody.<br> Hell, he wants to go national! Wants<br> to be watchdog for the whole US of A.<br> Love to help, but just like you don't<br> wanna mess with the Chicken Ranch...<br> ...I don't wanna ruffle<br> this old bird's feathers.<br> Here in Houston, he's becomin'<br> a regular Texas attraction.<br> Now, wait a minute, Ed Earl.<br> I'd tread easy on this one.<br> Them TV boys can be mighty powerful.<br> And mighty useful, if you get my meaning.<br> Senator, roll call.<br> Excuse me, Ed Earl. I gotta go.<br> It's that damn bilingual bullshit again.<br> Let me give you a word of advice<br> from one elected official to another.<br> Be careful of the box.<br> What the hell's goin' on? This goddamn<br> Thorpe's got the whole state bamboozled.<br> This is serious, Ed Earl.<br> You gotta do somethin'.<br> I intend to.<br> Deputy Fred, I want you to<br> hold down the fort for a while.<br> - Me?<br> - Yeah, you.<br> - Where you goin'?<br> - To Houston.<br> I'm gonna take care of that<br> little peckerwood myself.<br> - This is it.<br> - Thank you.<br> Come in.<br> - Mr Thorpe?<br> - I know you.<br> - You do?<br> - Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd.<br> They told me you were here. Come on in.<br> I hope I'm not... interruptin' anything.<br> Oh, please! It's my pleasure, my honour.<br> What brings you to Houston?<br> Sit down. Anywhere over here.<br> I'm gettin' dressed. Sit down.<br> I've got my TV show to do,<br> and I'm runnin' a bit behind time.<br> It's your show I want to talk to you about,<br> Mr Thorpe.<br> - Melvin.<br> - Melvin.<br> - Please. You watch the show, Ed?<br> - Well...<br> Last week was the best ratin' we ever had.<br> The city planning commissioner<br> was drivin' a city car...<br> Hold that for me, will you?<br> ...while he was on vacation.<br> Caught him dead to rights.<br> That pitiful putz.<br> Would you just pull that up?<br> Just pull that up.<br> And we broke a 30 share. It's affectin'<br> my pieces on the late night news.<br> Up, up, up.<br> They just love my little report.<br> - I hear you're very popular.<br> - The power of television...<br> ...of public exposure,<br> is so great it scares me.<br> I swear, I could get the mayor's<br> own children to throw rocks at him.<br> Which show did you like best, Ed?<br> I think the one about<br> the... nuts in the chocolate bar.<br> That's one of my favourites.<br> Threescore means 60, like the Bible says.<br> So if it says "60 nuts" on the wrapper...<br> ...I wanna see 60 nuts inside.<br> And I'm talkin' full nuts.<br> I'm not talkin' a half-nut...<br> ...or nut bits or nut chips.<br> I'm talkin' a full nut.<br> I can see that.<br> Thank God we still live in a society...<br> ...where anything that's phoney or<br> dishonest can't stand the light of day.<br> - Sock.<br> - Beg your pardon?<br> Sock. Thank you.<br> Yeah...<br> Most corporations<br> involved in false advertisin'...<br> ...would just laugh at a $50 fine.<br> But you show up with your TV camera<br> and give them a little bad publicity...<br> ...and they shape up faster than<br> goose shit slides through a tin horn.<br> (laughs)<br> (hums)<br> Melvin, it's that bad publicity I want to<br> talk to you about. That could hurt people.<br> You take that report you're doin'<br> on the Chicken Ranch.<br> That place is older than rocks and water.<br> I expect your granddaddy<br> took your daddy there...<br> ...to learn about the birds and the bees.<br> - (chuckles)<br> I'm from New Jersey. See, I moved<br> to Houston six years ago.<br> (chuckles)<br> Texas suits my style.<br> Every schoolboy in the state knows about<br> it. Most of the politicians have slept there.<br> The mayor and the people of my county<br> want to keep things just the way they are.<br> Hm. You know somethin', Sheriff.<br> It just struck me.<br> - We are in the same profession.<br> - What's that?<br> Law enforcement. I'm out there fightin'<br> for the rights of the public, just like you.<br> Both of us are trying to protect the public.<br> You in the old way and me in the new.<br> - The new?<br> - (chuckles) Television.<br> I'm the electronic bounty hunter.<br> I use a camera. You use a gun.<br> Yeah. Melvin, everybody'd be happy<br> if you'd just drop the whole thing.<br> I mean, those ladies out there,<br> they perform a necessary function.<br> - Right or wrong...<br> - Right or wrong don't interest me!<br> I'm no moraliser.<br> I leave all that to the preacher.<br> I'm glad. The mayor was thinkin' maybe<br> you'd want a little unnecessary publicity.<br> (laughs) Unnecessary publicity?<br> Well, he's got me all wrong!<br> I'm not one of those sensation-mongers<br> out to boost his own ego!<br> Clear.<br> - How do you like it?<br> - It's different.<br> I designed this myself.<br> No, you tell your mayor he's got<br> nothing to fear from me on that score.<br> - He'll be happy to hear that.<br> - I'm a lawman. That's my interest. Right?<br> (knocking)<br> - 20 seconds.<br> - Oh, I'm on!<br> Friend Ed, I gotta go.<br> That's my cue. Come on!<br> Aprs vous!<br> - I'd love to do an interview with you.<br> - I don't think I'm the type.<br> Nonsense! You're what<br> the public wants to see.<br> We'll discuss it after the show.<br> I want you to be my guest.<br> This is the sponsor's booth.<br> Just make yourself comfortable.<br> Make yourself to home.<br> See you later, partner.<br> He's out on the prowl<br> Guards and checks the best he can<br> Watchdog is a fighting man<br> Watchdog will throw<br> his beam of light around<br> If some folks don't toe the line<br> Watchdog's light will shine<br> Shine, shine, shine<br> (announcer) And now...<br> the Watchdog man himself.<br> The eyes and ears of Texas,<br> Melvin P Thorpe!<br> (cheering)<br> Thank you, fellow Texans,<br> and welcome to the Watchdog Report...<br> ...with yours truly, Melvin P Thorpe...<br> ...keepin' an eye on what's goin' on<br> in this beautiful state of ours.<br> This week's spotlight will shine<br> on a shameful situation...<br> ...that has been allowed to exist<br> for close to a hundred years.<br> I'm talkin' about<br> the Chicken Ranch, my friends.<br> The proprietor of this innocent-lookin'<br> ranch house is known only as Miss Mona.<br> And the man who turns his back<br> on her illegal operation...<br> ...is Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd!<br> Did I say "illegal"?

I knew a woman once<br> that had a vision of Jesus.<br> He came right into her house,<br> set right down at the foot of her bed.<br> Mm?<br> I don't know what I'd do<br> if that happened to me.<br> I'll tell you something. If Jesus comes to<br> your house, all hell's gonna break loose.<br> You got a point there, Ed Earl.<br> But Jesus was really good to<br> Mary Magdalene, the fallen woman.<br> He was always bein' very sociable.<br> He went to this big weddin' once,<br> and they ran out of wine.<br> You know what he did?<br> Turned the water into wine.<br> Well, that's a man that knows<br> how to throw a party.<br> Now, don't be sacrilegious.<br> I'm not. I'm not.<br> He forgives me.<br> - He knows I was kiddin'.<br> - I know he forgives you.<br> That's funny, how God can forgive you<br> and people can't.<br> - Now, why is that?<br> - Well, because people are not very godly.<br> I know. I know.<br> Yeah.<br> (chuckles)<br> What is it?<br> Melvin P Thorpe is a sorry son of a bitch.<br> You reckon he's gonna<br> run for the legislature?<br> Why?<br> I never told anybody this, Mona.<br> I was thinkin' of runnin'<br> for the legislature someday.<br> - Are you serious, Ed Earl?<br> - Yeah.<br> They say an honest man can't be<br> elected in this country any more.<br> But I don't believe that.<br> This is a good country.<br> I believe I could win.<br> Well, you got my vote.<br> I might even go register.<br> Boy, I sure didn't know<br> you had dreams that big.<br> - People really do like you, though.<br> - They like you too.<br> - Really?<br> - Sure.<br> You ask anybody in town.<br> Say "How do you like Miss Mona?"<br> They say "Shoot, she's a fine woman."<br> "Fine, friendly and nice."<br> I always just thought<br> if you see somebody without a smile...<br> ...give 'em yours.<br> - I like that.<br> I like that.<br> Think I'll use that as my campaign slogan.<br> "If you see somebody without a smile,<br> give 'em yours."<br> I'll have that printed up on a card.<br> Oh, you're kiddin' me, you smart ass.<br> I had a dream once.<br> Yeah?<br> - I'll tell you if you won't laugh.<br> - Oh, I won't laugh.<br> Well, I used to dream<br> of bein' a ballerina.<br> (sniggers)<br> Now, Ed Earl, I ain't tellin' you nothin'.<br> - Well... A ballerina?<br> - Yes, a ballerina!<br> (chuckles)<br> Well, I think that's wonderful. You still<br> could be a ballerina if you wanted to be.<br> - Don't be ridiculous!<br> - No, you could!<br> Go into training.<br> Just start jumpin' up and down.<br> Me? Jumpin' up and down?<br> I'd black both my eyes.<br> I couldn't now. I'm too top-heavy.<br> I have a hard enough time balancin' these<br> things now, without gettin' on my toes.<br> - You know somethin'?<br> - What?<br> You know that, uh... I don't see<br> anybody but you any more.<br> Course, you can't say the same, can you?<br> I haven't been to bed with another woman<br> besides you in three years.<br> You didn't know that, did you?<br> No, I didn't know that.<br> Nothin' better, once you've had the best.<br> - Hey, I like that.<br> - I thought you would.<br> Reckon if I was to run for the legislature<br> I could put that on my card?<br> Up next, Melvin P Thorpe continues<br> his expos of the Chicken Ranch...<br> ...with a violent demonstration<br> in the Gilbert town square.<br> Great God from Goldsborough!<br> (phone rings)<br> Yeah?<br> Ed Earl, you better turn on channel four.<br> That Melvin P Thorpe idiot's<br> got you on TV again.<br> Well, I don't give a shit, Rufus!<br> It's all very well to take<br> that attitude, Ed Earl...<br> Honey...<br> Put on the television there. Channel four.<br> That Melvin P Thorpe is<br> shootin' off his mouth again.<br> What could be so goddamn important?<br> Calm down, Rufus!<br> It can't be as bad as all that.<br> What happened to me as an individual<br> is not important.<br> Is this the kind of man we want<br> runnin' our law enforcement?<br> Is this the kind of foul-mouthed example<br> we wanna set for our innocent children?<br> Run the film.<br> Number three.<br> No sawed-off little (bleep) is gonna<br> accuse me of takin' a bribe and live,...<br> ...cos I wear the badge<br> in this (bleep) county!<br> - So you listen and you listen good, you...<br> - (bleeping)<br> If I ever see you or any of those (bleep)<br> In my town again,...<br> ...I'm gonna knock you so flat you'll...<br> - (bleeping)<br> (gunshots)<br> Ed Earl, that man<br> has made a fool out of you.<br> (gunshot)<br> I've had calls from preachers, deacons<br> and the presidents of two garden clubs!<br> Thank you for callin'.<br> The phones have been ringin' all mornin'.<br> Sheriff's office.<br> I don't know why I serve as mayor<br> of this incorporated sand trap anyway!<br> - What in the heck is keepin' him?<br> - He'll be along.<br> - Well, he'd better!<br> - My wife couldn't believe what she saw.<br> They bleeped him, but she read his lips<br> on every "hell", "goddamn" and "shit".<br> There's some folks gettin' up a petition<br> to close the Chicken Ranch.<br> All we wanted to do was keep it quiet.<br> Now, thanks to Ed Earl, it's the hottest<br> thing on the air since the Gong Show.<br> I'll tell him you called.<br> Mornin', Sheriff.<br> - Mornin', Rita.<br> - Here's your calls.<br> - Reckon you fellas are waitin' for me.<br> - We sure are!<br> You don't know the trouble you've caused!<br> Dad-gum it, Ed Earl!<br> If you ain't a pluperfect fool!<br> You may be right. I got over a dozen<br> messages here from outraged citizens...<br> ...tellin' me we got a whorehouse<br> in Lanville County.<br> Only been one here for about 150 years.<br> Ed Earl, you can set up speed traps<br> to catch the tourists.<br> You can look the other way when<br> a kid swipes a car to go joyridin'.<br> You can even let Miss Mona run her place!<br> But there's one thing you can't do:<br> Broadcast gutter talk on TV.<br> - I didn't know they was takin' pictures.<br> - What were the cameras for?<br> Damn it, CJ! You pious pissant.<br> I don't have one tenth the trouble<br> from Miss Mona's...<br> ...that I have from one of your<br> stag parties at the legionnaire hall.<br> - That ain't fair.<br> - There's just one thing to do.<br> Close the place before we all<br> go to hell in a handbasket.<br> Close it down!<br> She was just fine as long as<br> she was makin' civic contributions...<br> ...but the moment her luck ran sour,<br> you want to run out on her.<br> Run out on her like rats<br> from a burnin' barn!<br> That's just it, Ed Earl.<br> Who's gonna put out that fire?<br> Look, if you won't close her down,<br> tell her to lay low!<br> Yeah. Just until the heat<br> wears off a little bit.<br> Give it two months.<br> What's two months?<br> Nobody tells me<br> how to run my goddamn job!<br> And nobody gives me advice!<br> I'll do things my own way.<br> I'm gonna make up my own damn mind!<br> Two months.<br> What's two months?<br> Shut down for two months!<br> That is a hell of a lot<br> to ask somebody, Ed Earl.<br> And that's a hell of a lot of overhead<br> to pay out when cash ain't comin' in.<br> - What will I tell my girls?<br> - Well, maybe it won't be two months.<br> The holidays are comin'. Maybe in a week<br> or two the whole thing will blow over...<br> I warned you yesterday about<br> losin' your temper and carryin' on.<br> - Last night you was proud of me.<br> - Last night I wasn't on the 11.00 news!<br> I didn't know that son of a bitch<br> was gonna make an idiot out of me.<br> I don't know about that electronic bullshit!<br> How was I supposed to handle that?<br> That's your job, Ed Earl.<br> Ain't that what they pay you for?<br> I know my job! Don't be tellin' me<br> what my goddamn job is!<br> I could close this place down<br> in a New York minute!<br> All I'm askin' for is a little cooperation<br> so I can get through a difficult situation...<br> ...with as little trouble as possible!<br> - OK, OK! I'll shut it down.<br> - You will?<br> - What do you want? A written contract?<br> - You promise?<br> - Ed Earl, I am givin' you my word.<br> I'm sorry, Mona, about the whole situation.<br> Don't feel sorry for me.<br> I started out poor<br> and I worked my way up to outcast.<br> I know what I'm askin' is gonna turn out<br> to be the best thing for both of us.<br> Just trust me.<br> You know what burns my ass?<br> - What?<br> - A flame about three feet high.<br> Of course I trust you, you big cowboy.<br> Ain't I always?<br> Mm-hm.<br> No need to stop now.<br> Now get outta here.<br> Everything's gonna turn out just fine.<br> Don't you worry about a thing, honey.<br> Everything's gonna turn out<br> slicker than cat shit...<br> ...on a linoleum floor.<br> (laughs)<br> Well, if it ain't the celebrated<br> cussin' Sheriff of Lanville County.<br> - How are you, Sheriff?<br> - I'm fine. How are you, Porky?<br> Oh, Sheriff! I been real good all week.<br> I've lost six pounds.<br> Oh, yeah? Well, don't take nothin'<br> off them cheeks.<br> Oh, go on.<br> (laughs) Whoa!<br> Well, Jewel, I just promised the sheriff...<br> ...that we're gonna shut down<br> for two months.<br> What? How can you promise that?<br> What about the football game<br> celebration tomorrow night?<br> - I forgot all about that.<br> - It's the Thanksgiving game.<br> - That's real special.<br> - I know, Jewel!<br> I don't know what to do now.<br> I did promise.<br> You think, if we close the doors, just<br> went on as planned, that'd be all right?<br> I'm sure it will, honey. That party<br> is a bigger tradition than the game.<br> (crowd cheering)<br> here at Kyle Field...<br> ...and we have seen<br> an amazing ball game.<br> Texas A&M heavily favoured,<br> but we're tied 12-12.<br> Aggies have the ball, second down<br> at eight. Time is winding down.<br> They try the middle of the Texas defence<br> and again the break is stopped.<br> - This University of Texas defence...<br> - Whoo-wee!<br> Whoo!<br> String up the white. We'll see who wins<br> and put up the orange or the maroon.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> - I can't stand it if them Aggies win.<br> - What do you mean?<br> They're such animals. Always yellin'<br> and jumpin' about and sayin' "yee-ha".<br> They have to go for all the marbles,<br> they will have to throw right now.<br> Time running out. Miller rolls to the right.<br> Pass! Touchdown!<br> Yahoo!<br> Hell! That calls for a drink.<br> Don't let your mother see you.<br> - Well, who won?<br> - The Aggies.<br> - Oh, shit.<br> - (all) Yee-ha!<br> Yee-ha!<br> Yee-ha!<br> Hey, boys!<br> All right! Hey, boys!<br> Boys, boys! That was<br> the greatest victory...<br> ...since General Eisenhower won!<br> Senator, you ain't forgot you was gonna<br> take us to the Chicken Ranch, did ya?<br> - Yeah! How about it?<br> - I always keep my campaign promises.<br> The Chicken Ranch is a fine institution<br> and I'm proud to have it in my district.<br> And to hell with what<br> Melvin P Thorpe says.<br> I'll see all you seniors out at Miss Mona's.<br> We're gonna whomp and stomp<br> And a-whoop it up tonight<br> Those little gals won't<br> never ever be the same<br> They're gonna love it<br> when we whomp and stomp<br> And a-whoop it up, all right<br> It's even better than<br> an Aggie football game<br> Better than a football game?<br> And then we're gonna show them all<br> a thing or two<br> We're gonna demonstrate<br> Just what a champion can do<br> Yee-ha!<br> 75 miles until we get to heaven<br> 75 miles until our plans are laid<br> 75 miles until we get<br> to the Chicken Ranch<br> Where history and Aggie boys<br> get made<br> (whooping)<br> Yee-ha!<br> Lookit here!

Yee-ha!<br> One more mile until we get to heaven<br> One more mile until our plans are laid<br> One more mile until we get<br> to the Chicken Ranch<br> Where history and Aggie boys<br> get made<br> Yee-ha!<br> Y'all come on in!<br> Oh, I'm so glad to see you.<br> Congratulations!<br> Hey, boys!

I'm Senator Wingwood<br> of the 19th District...<br> ...and the Aggie class of '49.<br> Mighty proud to meet you.<br> To meet me!<br> Charlie, who you think you're talkin' to?<br> How's Mary Margaret and the kids?<br> Hell, Miss Mona,<br> I didn't think you'd remember.<br> Remember? Did you remember<br> to bring my cheque?<br> I got it right here.<br> Good. You know it's always a business<br> doin' pleasure with you, Charlie.<br> You boys head on out back.<br> We've got a nice surprise for you.<br> Come on, boys!<br> - (woman) Yoo-hoo! Boys!<br> honky-tonk piano)<br> Hi!<br> - Hiya, girls!<br> - (whistling)<br> (boys) Yee-ha!<br> (whistling)<br> Texas has a whorehouse in it<br> (humming)<br> (knocking)<br> - Yo!<br> - It's me, Deputy Fred!<br> Come on in, Fred!<br> - Evenin', Sheriff.<br> - Happy Thanksgiving. You want a drink?<br> Oh, no, thank you.<br> That stuff always tears up my stomach.<br> - I was readin' in the Reader's Digest...<br> - What do you want, Fred?<br> I was makin' my rounds around town...<br> ...and I saw Melvin P Thorpe and a bunch<br> of fellas headed out to the Chicken Ranch.<br> - Melvin P Thorpe.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Goin' out to the Chicken Ranch, was he?<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> He's gonna be real disappointed!<br> See, there ain't nothin' goin' on.<br> Miss Mona promised me to close down.<br> Well, she didn't.<br> I was out there this evenin'.<br> Those Aggies was just<br> celebratin' to beat the band.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Uh-huh!<br> - Oh, shit!<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Shh. Quiet.<br> Sh. This may be the most important<br> scoop of my television career.<br> Not now! Idiot boy.<br> Give me that.

Look who's here.<br> Senator, the eyes of Texas are upon you.<br> Come on, boys!<br> We got all we need.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> Oh!<br> Miss Mona!<br> Melvin P Thorpe. Gotcha!<br> Let's get to those vans!<br> We're gonna make the mornin' news!<br> See you on TV! (laughs)<br> Holy shit!<br> God almighty.<br> Damn it! You gave me your word!<br> And I took it!<br> - Now, I'm the law!<br> - That law! Talk about the law!<br> A bunch of crazies break into my house,<br> takin' pictures, invadin' my privacy.<br> Do you wanna know what the law's<br> gonna do? I can tell you - nothin'!<br> They had no reason to do nothin'<br> if you'd done what you said!<br> I trusted you. That's what hurt.<br> Don't you talk to me about trust!<br> I trusted you to protect me!<br> I made a mistake tonight, OK?<br> If that's your apology,<br> it ain't worth armadillo crap.<br> I ain't apologisin'! I'm a businesswoman<br> payin' out double taxes!<br> I expect a little protection for my money!<br> Where were you? I couldn't get you...<br> I was in bed, because you gave me<br> your word you were closin' down.<br> If Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace<br> was here, none of this...<br> Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace<br> couldn't hold my jock!<br> Goddamn it, Mona, you're makin' me mad!<br> Whoo! Listen at him cuss and shout.<br> Just like on TV!<br> You're just a kid<br> playin' at bein' a cowboy.<br> You ain't never gonna grow up!<br> You use me as your mistress.<br> You use that damn Dulcie Mae<br> as your in-town wife.<br> You even use that little boy of hers...<br> ...so you can play weekend daddy!<br> - Leave him out of it!<br> You're playin'. You're just a big,<br> overgrown kid playin' at bein' a man!<br> I don't have to listen to this shit. Damn it!<br> I'm the law. If I choose to, I'll close<br> this place down till hell freezes over.<br> Don't you threaten me.<br> I'm tellin' the truth, and you know it!<br> And all of your big dreams<br> of goin' to the legislature.<br> They're just dreams, cos you ain't never<br> gonna be no more than you are right now.<br> A chickenshit sheriff<br> in a chickenshit town.<br> You may be right. It's a hell of a lot<br> better than bein' a whore.<br> Legalised prostitution, pro or con,<br> is in the news today.<br> For a report, here is<br> Jeff Gerald in Gilbert, Texas.<br> The Chicken Ranch,<br> the legendary bawdyhouse...<br> ...is showing little activity after the<br> disclosure of the Thanksgiving-night raid.<br> - Get away!<br> - The deputy keeps away onlookers...<br> ...while up at the house the doors are<br> closed and the principals are not talking.<br> The Sheriff of Gilbert<br> refused interviews,...<br> ...while in Houston the man who launched<br> the campaign, Melvin P Thorpe,...<br> ...held a press conference today.<br> This report says that the Chicken Ranch...<br> ...is involved with and under the influence<br> of organised crime.<br> I am gonna take this report to Austin<br> in the hopes that the governor himself...<br> ...will come out of his long silence<br> on this issue and uphold the law.<br> - (applause)<br> - Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> The governor made no statement,...<br> ...but Senator Charles Wingwood,<br> a principal figure in the raid,...<br> ...held a press conference<br> explaining his involvement.<br> I have no independent recollection<br> of going to the Chicken Ranch.<br> I can only say, as the most dedicated<br> anti-Communist in the state legislature...<br> ...that I must have been drugged by<br> Communists or Communist sympathisers...<br> ...and placed there to harm<br> my reputation and good name.<br> Reaction across the state<br> is split 50-50.<br> But here in Gilbert,<br> the Chicken Ranch has many supporters.<br> I ain't never seen anything bad come out<br> of there, and I've lived here all my life.<br> Why, they attract a lot<br> of business to the community.<br> They pay their taxes,<br> just like you and me!<br> No one... no one was ever<br> forced to go up there.<br> My Frank, when he was alive,<br> used to go up there every Saturday.<br> I took it as a blessin'.<br> Of course, things were different then.<br> Nowadays women enjoy doin'<br> that sort of thing themselves.<br> At least, so I've been told.<br> The Chicken Ranch?<br> I think it's a good idea.<br> See, you take young boys<br> and they're gonna be lookin' for women.<br> If they can't find 'em, they'll rape 'em.<br> And if they don't...<br> ...they'll run to other women and get<br> diseases! Those girls went to doctors.<br> Although petitions are being circulated<br> to save the Chicken Ranch...<br> ...this bumper sticker<br> is beginning to appear.<br> And so, as feminists support the bill for<br> the decriminalisation of prostitution...<br> ...while traditionalists<br> lobby for its defeat,...<br> ...the fate of the Chicken Ranch rests with<br> the governor, who again was unavailable.<br> Jeff Gerald, ABC News,<br> Gilbert, Texas.<br> Thank you, Jeff. If there are...<br> Well, I hate admitting<br> I was wrong, Miss Mona.<br> But with television broadcasting all this...<br> ...we should've done what the sheriff said<br> and kept this place closed.<br> It was my fault, Jewel. It was my decision.<br> He ain't gonna be able to stop it<br> this time, is he?<br> No. He'd like to,<br> but he's out of his league.<br> He don't know how to fight 'em.<br> He's just a good old boy<br> that ain't never gonna grow up.<br> Honey, we see everything<br> in this profession.<br> But one thing I ain't never seen,<br> man nor woman, is a grown-up.<br> Don't be too hard on him.<br> He loves you.<br> Well, he ain't never said it.<br> Some men can't say the words, honey.<br> But that don't mean<br> they don't feel it in their heart.<br> Well, it's just as well anyhow, Jewel.<br> I set my course a long time ago...<br> ...and I can't go changin' now.<br> I don't know what to do. Folks got nothin'<br> to talk about but this Chicken Ranch mess.<br> Like a broken record:<br> Chicken Ranch, Chicken Ranch...<br> All of this bad publicity's<br> flat ruinin' business.<br> - I haven't sold a car in a week.<br> - It's ruinin' the town.<br> No one's blamin' you, Ed Earl.<br> It ain't your fault.<br> But we can't just sit around here<br> waitin' to grow tits!<br> The way I see it, the Chicken Ranch<br> served a purpose once.<br> But now everything's openin' up.<br> Do you know we are in the middle<br> of a worldwide sexual revolution?<br> Why, Miss Mona's ain't obscene,<br> it's just obsolete.<br> She ain't got a handful<br> of supporters left, Ed Earl.<br> All this publicity's makin' folks think twice<br> about signin' that petition.<br> Why can't that station in Houston look at<br> the cesspool in their own back yard?<br> How about Austin?<br> Two blocks from the state capitol...<br> ...you can have anything done to you<br> that you can get in Tangiers!<br> There's naked massages, tongue baths...<br> ...somebody ticklin' your ass with a feather.<br> If you know that for a fact,<br> Mr Newspaper Editor...<br> ...it's your duty to expose it!<br> Now, you see here, CJ! I don't give<br> a damn if folks want their ass tickled!<br> I kinda like to think that<br> that's what heaven is all about.<br> Boys, I got myself<br> a pretty good bullshit detector.<br> I can tell when somebody's peein' on<br> my boots and tellin' me it's a rainstorm.<br> Now, this thing's gotten way outta hand.<br> I don't know how.<br> - I figure there's only one thing to do.<br> - Close it down!<br> Nope. I'm goin' to Austin.<br> See the governor. Tell him<br> Miss Mona's side of the situation.<br> He sure as hell won't hear about it<br> from anybody here.<br> - You can't go up and see the governor!<br> - He don't see anybody!<br> He'll see me.<br> Feel like the country dog in the city.<br> If I stand still, they screw me.<br> - If I run, they bite me in the ass.<br> - (laughs)<br> I... I wish...<br> ...there was somethin' I could do.<br> Thank you.<br> They want me to close her down,<br> run her out of town.<br> How can I ask her to leave,<br> when all I want her to do is stay?<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> His Excellency, the Governor of Texas.<br> My friends, I want to thank you for that<br> sincere and heartwarming ovation.<br> No questions, please.<br> Governor, what do you think of<br> the crisis in the Middle East?<br> I was sayin' at the weekly prayer<br> breakfast in this historic capitol...<br> ...that it behooves<br> the Jews and the Arabs...<br> ...to settle their differences<br> in a christian manner.<br> Have you seen the evidence of the<br> disgraceful situation at the Chicken Ranch?<br> Fellow Texans, I am proudly<br> Standing here to humbly say<br> I assure you<br> And I mean it<br> Now, who says I don't speak out<br> as plain as day?<br> And fellow Texans<br> I'm for progress and the flag<br> Long may it fly<br> I'm a poor boy<br> come to greatness<br> So it follows<br> that I cannot tell a lie<br> - What the hell did he say?<br> - Same as usual. Not a damn thing.<br> Ooh, I love to dance<br> a little sidestep<br> Now they see me, now they don't,<br> I've come and gone<br> And ooh, I love to sweep<br> around the wide step<br> Cut a little swath<br> and lead the people on<br> - Governor!<br> - Yeah.<br> - Jerry Rogers of the Houston Post.<br> - Hi, Jerry.<br> Governor, do you plan to take action<br> against the Chicken Ranch?<br> Now, my good friends,<br> it behooves me<br> To be solemn and declare<br> I'm for goodness and for profit<br> And for living clean<br> and saying daily prayer<br> And now, my good friends,<br> you can sleep nights<br> I'll continue to stand tall<br> You can trust me<br> for I promise<br> I shall keep a watchful eye<br> upon y'all<br> - Did you get that?<br> - I hear him talkin', but he don't come in.<br> Ooh, I love to dance<br> a little sidestep<br> Now they see me, now they don't,<br> I've come and gone<br> And ooh, I love to sweep<br> around the wide step<br> Cut a little swath<br> and lead the people on<br> There he is. Come on, boys.<br> Governor! Governor.<br> Melvin P Thorpe,<br> Watchdog News.<br> Why has the Chicken Ranch operation<br> been so long ignored?<br> We have acoustic problems in here.<br> - Aren't you afraid of payoffs and bribes?<br> - Melvin, I'm sorry.<br> Enough pussyfootin', Governor.<br> What will you do...<br> ...about Miss Mona and the Chicken Ranch?<br> Now Miss Mona,<br> I don't know her<br> Though I've heard the name,<br> oh, yes<br> But of course I have<br> no close contact<br> So what she is doin'<br> I can only guess<br> And now Miss Mona<br> She's a blemish<br> on the face of that good town<br> I am takin' certain steps here<br> Someone somewhere's<br> gonna have to close her down<br> Can you believe that man?<br> - Is that a yes or a no?<br> - That's a possible maybe.<br> Ooh, I love to dance<br> a little sidestep<br> Now they see me, now they don't,<br> I've come and gone<br> And ooh, I love to sweep<br> around the wide step<br> Cut a little swath<br> and lead the people on<br> Ooh, I love to dance<br> a little sidestep<br> Ooh, I love to sweep<br> around the wide step<br> Cut a little swath<br> and lead the people on<br> Governor?
