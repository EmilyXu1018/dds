I got you.<br> You gonna pay for that though.<br> Mmm-mmm-mmm.<br> There you go.<br> We'll let the station<br> buy us lunch tomorrow.<br> I'll pick you up<br> around 11:00.<br> Splendid, Ms. Armstrong. That<br> fits very well into my schedule.<br> I'll call to confirm.<br> So, what, a sister<br> can't be professional?<br> Here we go. I guess<br> some things just never change.<br> Change is overrated, Harper.<br> All you had to do was ask me<br> for a copy of my book.<br> What for? You wouldn't<br> have given it to me.<br> True. But at least I would have<br> known that you were interested.<br> Don't play yourself, Harper.<br> I want the exclusive, okay? You can<br> save the sloppy seconds for Oprah.<br> If that's the case, how come you<br> can't look at me in my face?<br> Harper, Why'd you really leave<br> your girl at home this weekend?<br> 'Cause I wanted to hang out with the guys.<br> You know, cut up with the boys<br> before she came, that's all.<br> It's been a while. You know?<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> Good night, Harper.<br> Damn.<br> Come on, Harp! Let's go!<br> I'm about to run a Boston on you niggers.<br> Y'all about to be set.<br> Do you always have to talk trash?<br> Come on. It's just a game.<br> That's what all<br> punk-ass losers say.<br> Easy, Mojo,<br> leave the boy alone.<br> "Mojo." I haven't<br> heard that in a clip.<br> "Mo" to the "jo."<br> That's what I'll be putting on<br> my ladies when I do my thing.<br> Got them<br> turned the hell out.<br> They be making breakfast for<br> this fool, buying him jewelry.<br> Then they try<br> to figure out why,<br> 'cause they really<br> hate his yellow ass.<br> Then he drops them<br> like a bad habit.<br> Hold up, man.<br> I know damn well<br> you ain't talking<br> about a nigger<br> leaving a ho strung out.<br> Yeah, that is true, player.<br> You are the serial monogamist.<br> What? Serial what?<br> Yes.<br> Nigger, you be<br> having these girlfriends.<br> Better yet, these jive-ass<br> public relationships.<br> Talking about,<br> "This is my queen" and shit.<br> And the first moment<br> that she steps out<br> of your little boundary,<br> she's gone.<br> Dismissed with the quicks.<br> That's because none of them have<br> ever measured up to Jordan.<br> Oh!<br> Excellent point,<br> Counsel Murchison.<br> There it is right there.<br> Sustained.<br> - Get out of here!<br> - You know that's true.<br> Jordan's the best girlfriend<br> you never had.<br> Wait. Did you guys know<br> that they kissed in undergrad?<br> Up in the newsroom.<br> I remember that shit.<br> You knew about that?<br> Yeah, we knew about that shit.<br> Nigger, you know damn well<br> you can't keep a secret.<br> That is so messed up.<br> Come on, man.<br> Is that the case there, bro?<br> You waiting for Jordan to slow<br> down from that career path<br> for the Harper Stewart<br> rest stop?<br> You're tripping.<br> Let's play the game.<br> I still can't believe<br> you ain't never hit that.<br> Ah, me, neither.<br> Hey, y'all, I'm in a very<br> fulfilling relationship, okay?<br> A virtually drama-free<br> two years tomorrow. Okay?<br> That's right. She's a<br> stand-up comic, right?<br> No, no. She makes jewelry.<br> No, she is a teacher.<br> She is a caterer,<br> God damn it!<br> For the last time.<br> It took her a while to find her creative niche.<br> She found it. She's a caterer.<br> I can definitely<br> relate to that one.<br> But she still don't<br> sound like Jordan.<br> That's 'cause she ain't Jordan.<br> She's Robin.<br> Man,<br> I'm glad she ain't Jordan.<br> Why you say that?<br> Jordan's too damn sassy<br> and independent.<br> And she might make more cheese<br> than you someday, bro.<br> Yeah? And?<br> I love Jordan.<br> You know that, right?<br> But let's face it, dawg. A woman<br> like that don't need no man.<br> She's one step from lesbian.<br> Ooh!<br> No, hold on.<br> That's a nice thought.<br> All I'm saying is that the<br> only way a relationship works<br> is if the man<br> provides the loot<br> and the woman<br> takes care of the home.<br> You're talking like you're from the Stone Age.<br> You're a caveman.<br> - Just admit it, man.<br> - Isn't that ironic though?<br> Brothers are always talking<br> about gold diggers,<br> yet you can't take an educated<br> sister who makes more money?<br> No, I can't.<br> Murch,<br> we know you don't care.<br> Your woman gonna run<br> your ass regardless.<br> Bite it, Spivey.<br> Okay? Bite it.<br> Grow it, Murchie.<br> When me and Mia get married,<br> man, her only job's gonna be<br> being my wife and<br> raising our kids.<br> She's gonna be content with that?<br> Are you kidding?<br> Mia's straight-up old school.<br> She can't wait to drop<br> this mandingo's babies.<br> Consummate mother-whore.<br> Word is bond, dawg.<br> Word is bond.<br> Every man wants one.<br> Right.<br> Let me ask<br> you a question, man.<br> What's that?<br> What made you decide to just<br> up and get married now?<br> 'Cause you been dipping out on<br> Mia, no offense, for a while.<br> - And with the new contract...<br> - Oh, yes.<br> You're gonna need<br> a catcher's mitt to catch<br> all that new pussy<br> coming your way.<br> I done had all the ass 10 men can have.<br> My wild oats are sown.<br> Besides, how much ass<br> can one man have anyway?<br> A lot.<br> It's just time.<br> Marriage is sacred. My folks<br> have been together 35 years.<br> It means something to me.<br> I hear that.<br> Besides, marriage is gonna curb<br> that appetite for more women.<br> In case y'all didn't know, marriage<br> is the cure to promiscuity.<br> In what world?<br> I can't believe<br> you said that, man.<br> God damn, Lance.<br> You would have never known that<br> you graduated summa cum laude.<br> You say some dumb-ass shit.<br> Ah, there's a time<br> for everything, players.<br> We're in the real world now,<br> man.<br> The real world.<br> Real things.<br> Bang.<br> I don't give a damn<br> what y'all say.<br> Ain't nothing natural<br> about no monogamy.<br> God did not intend for us<br> to be with just one person.<br> If he had, he wouldn't have<br> given us all this sperm.<br> These bitches would not outnumber<br> us the way that they do.<br> Okay, okay.<br> Are you<br> a philosophy major now?<br> He is a bullshit artist.<br> Thank you.<br> What, nigger?<br> Fuck y'all, man.<br> Y'all know as well as I do,<br> ain't nothing better<br> than some pussy,<br> except some new pussy.<br> He's got a point there.<br> Plus, you can't trust<br> these bitches anyway.<br> They just as scandalous<br> as us niggers.<br> Oh, not all women, player.<br> Not all women.<br> Oh, so, you don't think that<br> Mia's ever got with other dudes?<br> I'm the first,<br> the last and the only.<br> Really?<br> Really.<br> How do you know this?<br> 'Cause the pussy curves to my dick.<br> That's how I know.<br> Besides,<br> I know my little angel, man.<br> You mean to tell me<br> with all the sticking<br> and moving<br> that you've done,<br> you don't think that Mia's ever<br> tippy-toed out the door on you once?<br> No.<br> Quentin, just play.<br> If she did go out and<br> get a little swerve on,<br> don't you think she'd be<br> well within her rights?<br> It's karma, baby.<br> Gotta take a piss.<br> Why did you<br> have to do that?<br> Whose hand is it?<br> Honestly, have you<br> ever fooled around with a girl?<br> What do you mean?<br> Yes, you have.<br> That night I met you,<br> you was talking...<br> Hold on a second.<br> What's up?<br> The book. I don't know, man.<br> I'm talking.<br> Go on, man.<br> It's in there.<br> Yeah, I'm back.<br> You didn't mess<br> around with a girl.<br> Ever mess around<br> with two guys at once?<br> Not even in high school?<br> Phew. Here we go.<br> Yo! You best get<br> your own copy, player.<br> I was just feeling a little<br> overprotective of my stuff.<br> It's too late for that. I<br> cannot wait to read this mug.<br> I know it's gonna be tight.<br> Well, you know...<br> Help yourself, man.<br> Look at you, man. You know<br> you're blessed, right?<br> The Lord is<br> smiling on you, bro.<br> Lance, dead that, man.<br> I make it happen.<br> Not some heavenly being<br> in the clouds possessing me.<br> Know what I'm saying? Me.<br> You're ignorant.<br> You know that, dawg?<br> How do you think we're as<br> fortunate as we are, man?<br> Any one of us.<br> We could be poor,<br> homeless, out on<br> the street with nothing.<br> Lance, tuxedo fitting tomorrow?<br> Yeah, man. We gotta<br> push it back till 5:00<br> 'cause Mia's got a laundry list<br> of things for this brother.<br> Actually that's cool, 'cause I'm<br> supposed to link up with Jordan.<br> That's right. Jordan.<br> I saw how she was<br> looking at you tonight, bro.<br> What, man? What did you see?<br> I saw that she wants<br> to get with you, player.<br> Whatever, man.<br> Yeah. "Whatever, man." You'll be<br> smacking bellies this weekend.<br> What happened to<br> that talk about fidelity<br> and putting an end<br> to promiscuity?<br> Come on, man. I was talking about me.<br> That don't apply to you.<br> Look here, man.<br> You got your girl,<br> and y'all doing<br> that relationship thing,<br> and that's cool.<br> Bu? Harp, YOU my boy, right?<br> MY man. my ace!<br> Jordan is fine, dawg.<br> So for once in your life<br> go ahead on and<br> be a dog, dawg.<br> I'm getting a headache. Oh, now<br> you're getting a headache.<br> Later, man.<br> All right.<br> All right, Murch, man.<br> Coming, dear.<br> Hmm, that's not the<br> worst thing in the world.<br> They were gonna<br> read it anyway, right?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> I just didn't think that they<br> would take it so literally.<br> I'm sure it'll be fine, baby.<br> Hey. I'm glad you called me.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, you're right. You're right.<br> It'll be okay.<br> Listen, did you<br> figure out what you're<br> gonna be wearing<br> to the wedding?<br> Not yet.<br> How about that little<br> beige number you got?<br> Strapless?<br> Harper, I know how to<br> dress for a wedding.<br> It's under control.<br> Okay. That's cool.<br> I'm not trying to...<br> Oh, my God!<br> Oh, my God!<br> Oh, my God,<br> look at the time.<br> I gotta get out of here.<br> Okay. I love you.<br> What?<br> I said, "I love you."<br> Uh...<br> I gotta go.<br> So, I'll see you, baby. Okay?<br> Morning.<br> Good morning.<br> I'm gonna be a second.<br> I'm gonna be a second.<br> Chop-chop. Time is money.<br> Okay.<br> Nice boxers.<br> I thought you were<br> strictly a briefs man.<br> They were a gift from Robin.<br> The girl's got taste, huh?<br> What about you? You got<br> any social life going on?<br> No, not really.<br> My professional<br> and personal life,<br> they cross over so much<br> I don't know where<br> to draw the line anymore.<br> But I'm fine with that, because<br> sacrifice is the name of the game.<br> You can't let<br> work consume you.<br> What?<br> Please, Harper. That doesn't<br> even sound like you.<br> Maybe I'm maturing.<br> No. Maybe you're<br> full of shit.<br> I know how badly you want<br> that limelight. I see it.<br> I recognize it in myself.<br> And besides,<br> you made that<br> painfully obvious<br> in your depiction<br> of Kendall.<br> I call it like I see it.<br> Then you must not<br> see yourself too well,<br> Jackson, because you<br> are exactly the same.<br> Two peas in a pod, huh?<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> You know, your girl, she must<br> be real patient or real dumb.<br> Robin deals with it.<br> She understands<br> that I had dreams<br> in my life way before<br> I had thoughts of her.<br> She is starting<br> to get that itch though.<br> Ooh.<br> The "M" word, huh?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> You got a problem<br> with that?<br> I mean, yeah!<br> Marriage, you know.<br> Moving in together.<br> The last person you<br> ever have sex with. Ever.<br> That's pretty deep.<br> At least you're getting<br> some on the regular.<br> What?<br> You ain't getting none?<br> Jordan!<br> Listen,<br> six months and counting.<br> And longer than that, if<br> you're talking about good sex.<br> You know what they say,<br> all work and no play makes...<br> Jordan a horny nut basket.<br> Okay. I'm gonna go with the pasta<br> bowls with the serving utensils.<br> Okay.<br> Thank you. Right?<br> Good choice.<br> Have you ever had Mia's shrimp<br> scampi with the linguini?<br> Yes, it is a bomb.<br> She used to cook at the drop of a<br> hat, and good stuff, too. Remember?<br> Oh, hell, yeah.<br> Girlfriend can throw it out.<br> Oh, that she does.<br> Little Mia.<br> Yeah, that<br> girl's got talent.<br> Oh, my God!<br> What's wrong with you?<br> You scandalous dog.<br> Jordan.<br> Oh, Harper,<br> don't walk away from me.<br> This whole thing,<br> it makes perfect sense.<br> Do you take Visa?<br> Yes, sir.<br> We just switched places.<br> Mia's Kacey, you're<br> Jackson and I'm Kendall.<br> You're bugging<br> the fuck out.<br> I'm Kendall.<br> Jackson sexes me crazy. Except you<br> and I, we never actually had sex.<br> And all Kacey and Jackson do is<br> sleep in the same bed together,<br> like you and I used<br> to do all the time.<br> The pressures of this wedding<br> are getting to you.<br> Oh, my God! The forehead kiss.<br> That is a dead giveaway.<br> What are you talking about,<br> forehead kiss?<br> The forehead kiss!<br> It's endearing.<br> Shit, it's damn near erotic!<br> You almost got me with it.<br> It's...<br> It's bullshit, okay?<br> We're talking about<br> fictitious accounts<br> of experiences that<br> I've gone through,<br> friends that I've known.<br> Ooh!<br> What? Now what?<br> You actually dedicated<br> that book to them?<br> Harper, are you crazy?<br> Do you want to be found out?<br> Harper, that is sick!<br> You're right, okay?<br> Because what you're suggesting to<br> me is sick and ludicrous. Okay?<br> So take a step back,<br> use your head and think.<br> If Lance finds out<br> what went down,<br> you better use<br> your feet and run.<br> That's cute. First off,<br> you need a sedative.<br> All right?<br> Secondly, Lance has got<br> a million important<br> things to do<br> to keep his mind<br> from wandering<br> on outlandish flights of fancy<br> from my little book.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> he won't have time to read it.<br> "White boys admired his<br> prowess on the hardwood<br> "and his reputation<br> with the ladies.<br> "They secretly deemed him<br> 'The Ebony Humper."'<br> This joint is hilarious, boy!<br> Whoo! Oh, man.<br> I'm gonna see you<br> at the church.<br> I see you've been reading.<br> Yeah, man, I've been reading.<br> That's funny. I figured you<br> wouldn't have enough time.<br> Me neither, man.<br> I had insomnia last night<br> and, player,<br> lam on edge, man.<br> Quentin's right. It's a<br> page-turner like a mug, man.<br> Quentin said that?<br> Yeah. You know what?<br> It's a good thing you changed<br> this dude to a hoop star, man.<br> I'll have to disassociate myself from this shit.<br> This dude banged many ho's.<br> You know what?<br> I'm flattered, right,<br> but was I really that bad?<br> Yeah, you were.<br> You're right. I can't deny it.<br> Oh, man!<br> Harp, open up, man!<br> What's up, man? I need your help, man.<br> I need your help.<br> I've called her, man. I haven't<br> talked to her in a week.<br> I went by her house,<br> she wasn't there.<br> Lance, Lance, Lance.<br> Okay, she's just upset.<br> I know she's upset.<br> Especially when she found out about<br> those honeys at the Cotton Bowl.<br> I know! I know! Damn it!<br> Lord, please forgive me<br> and my wayward dick.<br> What the fuck is<br> wrong with you?<br> I got to make<br> this right, Harp.<br> I cannot lose her over<br> this foolishness, man.<br> I love her, and I am so sorry<br> for what happened, man.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Then just say that, man.<br> Say it. Tell her.<br> Just tell her, "I'm sorry."<br> Yeah.<br> Isaiah 1:18?<br> Oh, Lance, man, you know I can't<br> get down with the religion.<br> All right.<br> Okay. "'Come, let's talk<br> this over,' says the Lord."<br> Ow, ow. My hand.<br> Uh. "No matter how deep<br> the strain of your sins<br> "I can take it out and<br> make you as clean as..."<br> "The freshly fallen snow."

I realized something.<br> I owe you a lot, man.<br> Mia's right.<br> You kept us together, dawg.<br> Man,<br> there ain't no need to...<br> No, you could have easily<br> dogged me out to Mia, man.<br> I know how close you and<br> your little sister are.<br> And I know that<br> there were times<br> you felt that<br> I didn't deserve her.<br> Lance, who am I to judge?<br> Harp, you're everything, man.<br> I just want to thank you.<br> And I promise you, I'm gonna make her happy.<br> I'm gonna be faithful to her.<br> Well, good.<br> Man, I can't believe it.<br> You are getting married.<br> You know, the ultimate step.<br> How do you...<br> Harp, I have to, man.<br> I may be strong<br> in mind and body,<br> but emotionally<br> I'm weak, dawg.<br> I need Mia in my life. She's<br> the one who makes me whole.<br> She's my Earth.<br> She's my queen.<br> Man, lam so far from that.<br> I mean, Robin is great,<br> but is she the woman<br> I'm supposed to grow old with?<br> Here I am. I'm just starting<br> to come into my own.<br> And I'm just supposed to commit to her?<br> Do I even know how to commit?<br> You committed to that book.<br> Man, no. No.<br> Those were on my own terms. All right?<br> I had sole control.<br> Lance, you don't understand.<br> No, I do understand.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> And I'm not afraid.<br> I made God a promise<br> that if he ever<br> gave me another<br> chance with Mia,<br> I would do right by her.<br> She has forgiven me for all my<br> indiscretions, man. It's amazing.<br> So if she ever slept<br> with somebody else...<br> What?<br> I'd just have to deal with it.<br> I wouldn't even<br> question her about it.<br> All because<br> of your faith in God?<br> Lance, I have to say<br> something to you, man.<br> What's up, dawg?<br> Damn!

You.<br> Okay.<br> Okay. I'm sorry.<br> I know we're both<br> a little emotional here.<br> I'm sorry.<br> We're peas in a pod, remember?<br> You know, maybe if I had the<br> luxury of getting my ass whupped,<br> I could be calm right now.<br> But I have been<br> drinking tequila shots.<br> My hormones are<br> raging out of control.<br> I'm emotional!
