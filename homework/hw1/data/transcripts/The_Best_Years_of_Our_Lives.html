Haven't you got anything<br> to say to your own son?<br> - Glad to see you, my boy.<br> - Look at him, Pat.<br> Look at your hero son. And look at<br> all those beautiful ribbons on his chest.<br> Go on, Freddy, tell your father how you<br> got those ribbons and what they mean.<br> - Where's Marie?<br> - Marie?<br> - Yeah. Is she out?<br> - Marie isn't here, Freddy.<br> - Will she be back soon?<br> - She's not living with us.<br> - She took an apartment downtown.<br> - Why didn't anybody write me about it?<br> We were afraid it might worry you,<br> you being so far away.<br> It was inconvenient for Marie,<br> living here, after she took that job.<br> But we forwarded all your letters<br> and the allotment cheques.<br> She took a job? Where?<br> Uh... some nightclub.<br> I don't know just which one.<br> The poor girl works till all hours.<br> - Where does she live?<br> - Uh... Grandview Arms on Pine Street.<br> But there's nothing to worry about.<br> Marie's fine.<br> We saw her last Christmas.<br> She brought us some beautiful presents.<br> - Marie's a good-hearted girl.<br> - You know what time she goes to work?<br> Uh... well, about supper time, I imagine.<br> Do you mind if I leave my stuff here?<br> I'll pick it up later.<br> Sure, but aren't you gonna stay<br> and have a bite to eat?<br> No, thank you, Hortense.<br> Well, uh... so long, Pop.<br> I'll be back.<br> Well, it's... I'm glad<br> to have you home, my boy.<br> It's good to be home, Pop. Bye.<br> Here, a cap.<br> Here's a samurai sword, Rob.<br> Thanks very much, Dad.<br> And here's a flag I found<br> on a dead Jap soldier.<br> All that writing is good-luck messages<br> from his relatives.<br> Yes, I know. The Japanese attach a lot of<br> importance to their family relationship.<br> Yeah. Yeah, entirely different from us.<br> - You were at Hiroshima, weren't you?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Did you notice any of the effects of<br> radioactivity on the people who survived?<br> No, I didn't. Should I have?<br> We've been having lectures<br> in atomic energy at school.<br> Mr McLaglen, our physics teacher,<br> he says that we've reached the point<br> where the whole human race has either<br> got to find a way to live together, or else...<br> - Or else.<br> - That's right. Or else.<br> When you combine atomic energy with jet<br> propulsion and radar and guided missiles,<br> just think of the...<br> Oh, you're just kidding me, Dad.<br> You've been to all these places<br> and you've seen everything.<br> I've seen nothing.<br> I should have stayed home<br> and found out what was really going on.<br> I finished the dishes.<br> Why do you have to do that?<br> Is this the maid's night out?<br> Our maid took a night out three years ago<br> and we haven't seen her since.<br> But everything's all right because<br> I took a course in Domestic Science.<br> What's happened to this family? All this<br> atomic energy and scientific efficiency...<br> - It was the war! You heard about that.<br> - Yeah.<br> All those problems on the home front.<br> We used to read about 'em<br> in Stars and Stripes.<br> We felt awfully sorry for the civilians.<br> You don't have to worry about us, though.<br> We can handle the problems. We're tough.<br> Rob, haven't you any homework?<br> Oh, sure.<br> - Night, Dad.<br> - I don't see why you have to go now.<br> Rob, aren't you going to take<br> the souvenirs Father brought you?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Thanks an awful lot, Dad,<br> for these... things.<br> - Good night. See you in the morning.<br> - Night.<br> - Night, Mom.<br> - Good night, darling.<br> Nice to have you around, Dad.<br> You'll get us back to normal.<br> Or maybe go nuts myself.<br> What do you think of the children?<br> The children?<br> I don't recognise them.<br> They've grown so old.<br> I tried to stop them, to keep them<br> just as they were when you left,<br> but they got away from me.<br> I guess Peggy has a lot of boyfriends.<br> She's very popular.<br> - Is she concentrating on anyone?<br> - She hasn't told me of anyone.<br> But you've, uh... told her<br> all the things she ought to know?<br> What, for instance?<br> Well, have you?<br> She's worked two years in a hospital.<br> She knows more than you or I ever will.<br> - Want a cigarette?<br> - Have you forgotten? I don't smoke.<br> - Sorry.<br> - It's all right, darling.<br> Yeah, it's frightening.<br> What is?<br> Youth.<br> Didn't you meet young people<br> in the army?<br> No, they were all old men, like me.<br> Yes...<br> It's terrible to be old, isn't it?<br> - Why don't you sit down and relax?<br> - I'm perfectly relaxed standing up.<br> Is there such a thing<br> as a drink in this house?<br> I'll see.<br> We haven't got bacon for Dad's breakfast.<br> I'll go out first thing and try to get some.<br> Is this all the liquor we have left?<br> Gosh, I'm afraid so.<br> I wish he'd given us some warning<br> he was going to get here today.<br> Don't worry, Mom.<br> I mean, so that we could have<br> gotten in some supplies of things.<br> Oh, Mother.<br> I know it's a little difficult, but...<br> that's only because Dad's<br> so crazy about you,<br> and he's been away so long<br> and missed you so terribly.<br> He can't just walk in<br> and immediately pick up...<br> Hey, I got a wonderful idea.<br> Let's go out on the town, the three of us.<br> - Tonight?<br> - Yes, tonight.<br> - To celebrate the old man's homecoming.<br> - Not me.<br> No, no, no. You too.<br> The three of us.<br> I want to do something, see something.<br> I've been in jungles<br> and around savages so long,<br> I gotta find out<br> I'm back in civilisation again.<br> (? swing)<br> ? Be-bop, be-bop<br> ? Be-bop a-ree-bop<br> (slurred) Rupert, another one in here.<br> (? swing)<br> I'll tell you, as I see it, we're headed<br> for bad times in this country.<br> Of course, we're in the backwash of the<br> war boom, but the tide is running out fast.<br> Next year, we'll see widespread<br> depression and unemployment.<br> Oh, have a cigar?<br> No, thanks. I've got my pipe.<br> Homer? Didn't you contract<br> the tobacco habit in the navy?<br> Just cigarettes, Mr Cameron. Thanks.<br> Wilma tells us you were in the Philippines.<br> I was around there, Mrs Cameron,<br> but I never saw anything.<br> - Did you meet General MacArthur?<br> - No, I didn't get to meet him.<br> - I've got a light, Mr Cameron.<br> - No, that's all right.<br> Got it.<br> - (Mr Parrish) Luella.<br> - Yes, Dad?<br> I've always thought<br> he's such a handsome man.<br> - Who?<br> - General MacArthur.<br> Oh...<br> - May I help you with that, Mrs Parrish?<br> - No, you sit right down.<br> - Lemonade, Mrs Cameron?<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Thought about getting a job, Homer?<br> - Well, I...<br> Father, it's much too soon for Homer<br> to be thinking about a job.<br> He's just out of the hospital.<br> Yes, but a few months from now the same<br> opportunities won't exist that exist today.<br> You might think about my business -<br> insurance. We've taken on veterans.<br> They make good salesmen, men who<br> have suffered some kind of disability.<br> Come down to the office<br> one of these days, we'll talk it over.<br> - I'm sorry, Mom.<br> - That's quite all right, Homer.<br> It won't hurt the carpet a bit.<br> Luella, go and get me a dishrag.<br> There's another one for you, Homer.<br> Wilma will hold it for you.<br> No, thanks. If you don't mind,<br> I think I'll go out and walk around a bit.<br> Where's Homer?<br> He went out.<br> (out of tune) ? It's home, boys, home,<br> home we ought to be<br> ? Home, boys, home,<br> back in God's country<br> Pick-Up Caf.<br> There it is, driver. Stop here.<br> Don't you think it's time to go home<br> to bed and get some sleep?<br> Absolutely. Sleep. But first we've got<br> to stop and have one last little drink.<br> No arguments. One drink.<br> Come on in, driver, and have one with us.<br> (? "Toot, Toot, Tootsie, Goodbye")<br> Hey, Homer!<br> It's good to see you, kid.<br> Your friend told me you were home,<br> but I didn't expect you...<br> Hiya, Captain!<br> Hiya, Homer, my old shipmate! Sit down.<br> So you took my advice and came to<br> Butch's? Come on, let's have a drink.<br> - Hello, Homer.<br> - Hi, Steve!<br> Am I happy to see you back home again.<br> Go ahead, shake, pal.<br> It won't bite you.<br> - What'll you have?<br> - I've dreamed of hearing that question.<br> Before I went in the navy<br> Butch would never let me drink liquor.<br> He'd read me lectures<br> on the curse of drink.<br> But it's different now. I'm a veteran.<br> Give me a whiskey, Steve. Straight.<br> - How about it, Butch?<br> - Draw a beer for the navy.<br> - Butch, I ordered whiskey.<br> - Beer.<br> Beer.<br> I'm gonna take my trade to some other<br> joint where I don't have relatives.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Why aren't you home with the folks?<br> Well, they... they went to bed<br> and I wasn't sleepy,<br> so I thought "Why not<br> come down and see Butch?"<br> Glad you did, Homer.<br> Well, here's to you, Butch.<br> How am I doing?<br> - Kid, you're doing great.<br> - Thanks.<br> Where did you leave Al?<br> Al's home in the swankiest<br> apartment house in town.<br> We'll never see him again.<br> Say, this is the best place we've been yet!<br> Hey, that's Al.<br> Hey, where you been?<br> We were just talking about you.<br> (Al) Oh, my aching back.<br> (slurring words)<br> Hey, Milly. Peggy.<br> Step up and meet the gang.<br> - This is Homer, this is Fred.<br> - How do you do?<br> Homer and I were together at the Battle<br> of Lingayen Gulf, only we didn't know it!<br> - Hiya, bud.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Al, this is my uncle Butch.<br> - Bu...?<br> Oh! I hear you got a new neon sign, huh?<br> Good for you.<br> - Now the party can really get started, eh?<br> - This way, please.<br> - Let's sit. Milly, come on.<br> - Here's a good booth.<br> Fred... Sit down. Fred, where's<br> your wife? I want to meet her.<br> I haven't been able to find her.<br> She works in some nightclub.<br> We'll find it, Fred, before this night is out.<br> We'll deploy our forces<br> and comb the town. Won't we?<br> By all means.<br> We got the navy to convoy us. Huh?<br> First, Homer lost his hands.<br> He's got those hooks instead.<br> They don't worry him, so they don't<br> need to worry anybody else.<br> - Right.<br> - Now let's get seriously to work.<br> - Telephone.<br> - Thanks. Give them anything they want.<br> - Any kind of beer.<br> - What'll it be, folks?<br> - How are you?<br> - Hiya.<br> - Nice to see you. Looking well.<br> - Hello.<br> A little grey...<br> - (British accent) Well, cheers. Cheers.<br> - Cheers!<br> Homer. Homer.<br> OK, Butch.<br> Aren't you drinking?<br> - Excuse me, folks.<br> - Sure, Homer.<br> Gee, Butch, it's swell<br> to hear you playing again.<br> How about "Lazy River"?<br> Remember that?<br> Sit down, Homer.<br> (? "Lazy River")<br> - Wilma phoned.<br> - Wilma?<br> - What did she want?<br> - You.<br> Oh, why can't they leave a guy alone?<br> Because they're fond of you, that's why.<br> What made you leave the house<br> and get them worried?<br> Oh, they... they got me nervous.<br> - How?<br> - It's nothing. I don't wanna talk about it.<br> How'd they get you nervous?<br> Well, they...<br> They keep staring at these hooks,<br> or else they keep staring away from 'em.<br> You mean whatever they do is wrong.<br> Why don't they understand that all I want<br> is to be treated like everybody else?<br> Take Pop, for instance.<br> He was cleaning his pipe,<br> like I've seen him do a million times.<br> All of a sudden he got conscious<br> that he had hands and I didn't,<br> and he... he stopped cleaning his pipe<br> and he tried to hide his hands,<br> like he was guilty or something.<br> Give 'em time, kid. They'll catch on.<br> You know, your folks'll get used to you<br> and you'll get used to them.<br> Then everything'll settle down nicely.<br> Unless we have another war.<br> Then none of us have to worry, because<br> we'll all be blown to bits the first day.<br> So cheer up, huh?<br> Hey, Butch.<br> You know "Among My Souvenirs", huh?<br> ? There's nothing left for me<br> Shh.<br> (? "Among My Souvenirs")<br> - Shall we dance?<br> - That's a charming idea.<br> Do you remember this tune?<br> Nice to see the young folks<br> enjoying themselves, isn't it?<br> So you're Al's daughter.<br> Yes. I've been that<br> as long as I can remember.<br> You don't seem like Al's daughter.<br> Actually, I'm not.<br> He's my son by a previous marriage.<br> - What did you say your name was?<br> - Peggy.<br> Peggy. My name's Fred.<br> How do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> (? tune ends)<br> No, you... Oh, no.<br> (? "The Beer-Barrel Polka")<br> You're a bewitching little creature.<br> - In a way, you remind me of my wife.<br> - But you never told me you're married.<br> Oh, yeah. I've got a little woman<br> and two kiddies back there in the States.<br> - But let's not think of them now.<br> - Oh, you're so right.<br> This night belongs only to us.<br> That's the type of thing<br> people ought to be thinking about.<br> All right, I promise<br> I'll get right to work on it.<br> And there's one thing<br> I've been wanting to ask you.<br> You ask it, Peggy.<br> You mustn't feel shy with me.<br> Why don't you call your wife?<br> I don't know her number.<br> I couldn't find it in the phone book.<br> Phone book?!<br> We don't need to do any telephoning.<br> We're all set.<br> What you need is a drink. (whistles)<br> - Good night, everybody. I'm going home.<br> - Why?<br> - I've got to. Butch is gonna drive me.<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> - No, you can't...<br> - It's quite all right.<br> - Don't leave. I'll be right back.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Poor kid. He's got to go home.<br> Doesn't that put any ideas in your head?<br> Yes. (whistles)<br> I'd love to.<br> (Peggy and Fred laugh)<br> (Butch) Lights out, Steve.<br> Oh! Ho-ho-ho!<br> Where do we go next, old pal, old pal?<br> Just follow me, old pal.<br> Step.<br> - Good night, Al.<br> - Good night. Nice party.<br> This it, Fred?<br> It looks like it.<br> Ooh, silly.<br> Good night, Milly. Many thanks<br> for a most enjoyable evening.<br> - Good night, Fred.<br> - Good night, Al.<br> Best of luck to you.<br> - I'll give him your message.<br> - You do that.<br> (British accent) And good night to you,<br> Peggy. It has indeed been a pleasure.<br> - Yes, Fred. See you soon.<br> - By all means.<br> Ooh!<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Good night.<br> We'd better wait and see if he gets in.<br> I don't think he even knows<br> if this is the right place.<br> Come on.<br> Up...<br> - Where are we all going now?<br> - Don't ask. We want it to be a surprise.<br> - They make a lovely couple, don't they?<br> - (laughs) Yeah.<br> I think they'll be very happy together.<br> - Who are you?<br> - Don't you remember? I'm Peggy.<br> Oh, yes. Peggy.<br> I'm not that Peggy.<br> That's too bad.<br> (AI humming)<br> (mumbling)<br> (continues humming)<br> As I remember, when you lie<br> flat on your back you snore.<br> Where's your hand?<br> (continues humming)<br> Give me your hand.<br> ?... my souvenirs<br> ?... my souvenirs<br> ?... my souvenirs<br> (continues slurred singing)<br> - Is Fred all right?<br> - Yes. He's all right.<br> - You'll be comfortable here.<br> - Sure, Mom. Night.<br> Night, dear.<br> - Night.<br> - Night.<br> (angry mumbling)<br> (sleepy mumbling)<br> Bandits at four o'clock.<br> It's all right, buddy.<br> You got him.<br> He's hit.<br> She's on fire. She's on fire!<br> The fire's spreading.<br> It's Gadorsky.<br> There goes number four.<br> She's breaking formation.<br> Watch out for fighters.<br> It's spread to the wing.<br> The wing's on fire!<br> She's out of control.<br> She's out of control!<br> She's going down!<br> Hey, you guys, jump!<br> Get outta there! Bail out!<br> Gadorsky!<br> Gadorsky, get out of that plane!<br> Two chutes open.<br> Three.<br> - The rest of you guys...<br> - Fred.<br> ...get out!<br> - Fred, wake up!<br> - Gadorsky! Gadorsky!<br> - Wake up!<br> - She's burning up! Get out! Get out!<br> - Fred! Fred, wake up!<br> She's burning up!<br> She's gonna hit. Look out!<br> It's all right, Fred. Go back to sleep.<br> Go back to sleep.<br> Go back to sleep, Fred.<br> - There's nothing to be afraid of.<br> - (sobbing)<br> All you have to do is...<br> go to sleep and rest.<br> Go to sleep.<br> Go to sleep, Fred.<br> Go to sleep and rest.<br> Go to sleep, Fred.<br> Go to sleep.<br> All you have to do is rest.<br> Go to sleep.<br> Oh, I'm terribly sorry I woke you up.<br> Oh, that's all right. But...<br> I know. You're about to say "Where am I?"<br> I'll tell you later, Fred.<br> You can sleep as long as you want.<br> (groans)<br> Did he fly 17 s or 24s?<br> I don't know.<br> - What group was he with?<br> - He didn't say.<br> Well, what did you two talk about?<br> Rob, you'd better hurry up.<br> You'll be late for school.<br> Holy Moses!<br> I'll see you later. Bye.<br> Oh, excuse me, Captain.<br> I'm Rob Stephenson, Peggy's brother.<br> She's in there in the kitchen,<br> fixing your breakfast.<br> I've gotta run. Goodbye.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Sit down.<br> - Here, this may help.<br> - Thanks.<br> Sit down.<br> You're Peggy, aren't you?<br> For the last time, yes.<br> - Want some eggs?<br> - You think I can take 'em?<br> Sure, they'll be good for you.<br> - Like 'em scrambled?<br> - Any way you cook 'em.<br> Good.<br> Sleep all right?<br> Wonderful.<br> That's good.<br> Can I help you with any of that business?<br> You can pour the coffee<br> if you want some.<br> Do you mind if I ask you<br> a personal question?<br> No.<br> Where did you sleep last night?<br> On the couch.<br> - That's terrible.<br> - What's terrible?<br> I should have had enough sense to go to<br> a hotel and not come here, bothering you.<br> You didn't bother anybody, Fred.<br> We're very glad to have you here.<br> Besides, you couldn't have<br> gotten a room in a hotel.<br> Did I get out of line with you?<br> No. Not really.<br> That's good.<br> Cos, you see, I'm married.<br> Yes, I know.<br> I must have got pretty plastered last night.<br> You had nothing on my dad.<br> Your dad? Who's he?<br> Don't you remember Al?<br> Oh, Al. Yeah, good old Al.<br> - Where is he?<br> - Still asleep, I guess.<br> So you're Al's daughter.<br> You've got it all straight now.<br> - I feel a lot better.<br> - That's good.<br> - Are you married, Peggy?<br> - No.<br> You've hardly had time.<br> You must have been engaged, though.<br> No.<br> Why not? What's the matter<br> with the guys around here?<br> I guess the best of 'em<br> are already married.<br> - Good morning, Fred.<br> - Good morning, Mrs, uh...<br> - Milly's the name.<br> - Thanks, Milly.<br> When Al wakes up, tell him how much I...<br> You're not going? You haven't even<br> finished your breakfast.<br> I haven't got much of an appetite.<br> Besides, I've got to get downtown.<br> Maybe now I can get into<br> where my wife lives.<br> I'll drive you, Fred. I've got to get to work<br> at the hospital. I'll just be a minute.<br> - I must've acted disgracefully last night.<br> - No.<br> You just fell in with bad company<br> at Butch's and got stinking.<br> You see, the whole trouble was,<br> I couldn't find Marie - that's my wife.<br> I didn't know she had a job<br> in a nightclub.<br> Could happen to anyone. If Al had come<br> home later, we wouldn't have been in.<br> - He wouldn't have known where we were.<br> - How is Al?<br> - We don't know yet.<br> - Ready, Fred.<br> Well, when he wakes up you can tell him<br> I think he's a pretty lucky guy.<br> - Thank you, Fred.<br> - Goodbye. Thanks a lot for everything.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Bye, Mom.<br> - Bye, dear.<br> (thud)<br> (shower starts)<br> ? Among my souvenirs<br> ? Among my... (gasps)<br> - What'd you do before the war, Fred?<br> - I was a fountain attendant.<br> - A what?<br> - Soda jerk.<br> - Oh.<br> - Surprised?<br> Yes, a little.<br> I'll bet you mixed up<br> a fine ice-cream soda.<br> You're darn right.<br> I was an expert behind that fountain.<br> I'd toss a scoop of ice cream in the air,<br> adjust for velocity, altitude,<br> and - wham! - in the cone every time.<br> I figure that's where<br> I really learned to drop bombs.<br> What do you think you'll do now?<br> I'm not going back to that drugstore.<br> Somehow or other, I can't figure myself<br> getting excited about a root-beer float.<br> I don't know just what I will do,<br> but I'm gonna take plenty of time<br> looking around.<br> I guess after all the places you've been,<br> Boone City looks pretty dreary to you.<br> Not from where I'm sitting right now.<br> That's not just a line. I really meant it.<br> (knocking at door)<br> - Who's that?<br> - It's me, Milly.<br> - I brought your breakfast.<br> - Oh! Thanks.<br> - Didn't think you'd be up for hours.<br> - I had a dream. I dreamt I was home.<br> I've had that same dream<br> hundreds of times before.<br> This time I wanted to find out<br> if it's really true.<br> - Am I really home?<br> - Looks like it.<br> And you're going to be royally treated.<br> You're having breakfast in bed.<br> I seem to have a vague recollection that<br> we had a couple of children. Is that right?<br> - That's right.<br> - Whatever became of them?<br> Rob's gone to school<br> and Peggy's driving downtown with Fred.<br> Fred? Oh.<br> Oh, yeah, Fred.<br> He's a great guy.<br> All right?<br> There's your breakfast.<br> I have work to do.<br> Well, it was nice knowing you, Peggy.<br> That sounds like a permanent goodbye.<br> You never know.<br> You and your wife<br> must come up to dinner.<br> That'd be fine.<br> Oh, there's one thing more.<br> About that dream I had last night.<br> I've had it before.<br> - I'm sorry I bothered you with it.<br> - I...<br> But you were very kind, and you didn't<br> even mention it this morning.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> you've been swell about everything.<br> They ought to put you in mass production.<br> - Goodbye, Fred.<br> - Bye.<br> Maybe I'd better wait and see if you get in.<br> Maybe that's a good idea.<br> Bye.<br> - (door bell)<br> - All right! All right!<br> Say, what's the big i...?<br> - Freddy!<br> - Hiya, babe.<br> Freddy, darling,<br> why didn't you let me know?<br> - You didn't give me time to fix my face.<br> - You look all right.<br> Oh, Freddy, darling, I'm so excited!<br> I can't believe it's you!<br> Come on in, honey,<br> where I can look at you.<br> Oh, you're marvellous!<br> All those ribbons!<br> You gotta tell me what they all mean.<br> But not now.<br> Let me look at you.<br> But how did you know I was here?<br> - I got in yesterday, went to Pop's house...<br> - Yesterday?! Why didn't...?<br> I came here, but you'd gone to work.<br> I went from one nightclub to another.<br> - You were looking for me?<br> - For my wife.<br> Well, you've found her now.<br> I wonder how Fred's getting along.<br> Fred's able to take care of himself.<br> I'm not so sure. It isn't easy for air force<br> glamour boys when they get grounded.<br> When you've been in the infantry, any<br> change is bound to be an improvement.<br> Stop fussing around<br> and sit down and talk to me.<br> All right, Sergeant.<br> Gosh, you've got tough.<br> - Is this all the cream?<br> - That's all.<br> Fine situation when a man can't<br> get enough to eat in his own home.<br> - Look at my pants.<br> - What about them?<br> Too big! Gives you an idea<br> of what the war did to my waistline.<br> - You holding your stomach in?<br> - No, it's disappeared.<br> I'll have to take<br> all my old clothes to be altered.<br> I wouldn't be in too much of a hurry.<br> A couple of weeks of heavy eating<br> and those pants will fit perfectly.<br> (phone rings)<br> Don't answer it.<br> Hello?<br> Oh, yes. He's here.<br> For me?<br> If it's the War Department, I'm out.<br> - It's Mr Milton.<br> - Who?<br> - Mr Milton at the bank.<br> - Oh.<br> He'll be right on.<br> Hello?<br> Oh, yes, Mr Milton.<br> Yeah, it sounds good to hear yours.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, indeed, Mr Milton. Yeah...<br> Well, not too bad, no.<br> Yes. Why, of course.<br> It's very kind of you to say that.<br> Mm-hm.<br> Mm-hm.<br> Yes.<br> Well, I'll... I'll certainly drop in.<br> Oh, she's fine, thank you.<br> Yes, they're fine too.<br> Well...<br> I...<br> That's...<br> Thank you, Mr Milton.<br> Yes, good...<br> Good...<br> Good... goodbye.<br> Mr Milton.<br> He calls every day to see if you're home.<br> I guess they want you back at the bank.<br> - He wants me to drop in and talk about it.<br> - You're not going to work right away?<br> You ought to rest awhile, take a vacation.<br> I've got to make money.<br> Last year it was kill Japs,<br> and this year it's make money.<br> - We're all right for the time being.<br> - Mm.<br> Why do they have to bother me<br> the first day I get home?<br> Why not give me time to get used to<br> my family? Come over here and sit down.<br> - Chair's liable to break.<br> - We can't be worrying about chairs.<br> Not when they want me back<br> in a nice fat job in a nice fat bank!<br> - You don't seem very happy about it.<br> - I'm not.<br> - Why not, darling?<br> - I keep thinking about the other guys.<br> All the ones who haven't got you.<br> - You're crazy.<br> - No, too sane for my own good.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - Wasn't this Bullard's Drugstore?<br> Yes, but it was taken over<br> by the Midway chain.<br> - Oh.<br> - But old Mr Bullard's still here.<br> - He's right over there by the phone.<br> - Thanks.<br> Yes, sir?<br> - Oh, Fred!<br> - Hello, Mr Bullard.<br> - It's good to see you again.<br> - It's good to see you.<br> - Say, what happened here?<br> - Well, I sold out.<br> Midway had been after<br> this location for a long time.<br> - Didn't he used to work here?<br> - Yes, he did.<br> I'll bet he's back looking for a job.<br> And he'll get it, too,<br> with all those ribbons on his chest.<br> Well, nobody's job is safe<br> with all these servicemen crowding in.<br> - Meet our new manager, Mr Thorpe.<br> - Oh, no, I don't think so.<br> I just dropped in to say hello to you.<br> I don't want that old job back.<br> Yes, I know.<br> But Midway's a big, big outfit.<br> You never can tell. Come along.<br> - Thank you, Mr Bullard.<br> - I'll see you later.<br> - I see you had a splendid war record.<br> - Just average, Mr Thorpe.<br> Since this business changed hands, we're<br> not obliged to give you your old job back.<br> I wasn't thinking of my old job.<br> I'm looking for a better one.<br> What are your qualifications?<br> Your experience?<br> Two years behind a soda fountain,<br> three years behind a Norden bombsight.<br> Yeah. While in the army, did you have<br> any experience in procurement?<br> - No.<br> - Purchasing of supplies, materials?<br> No, I just dropped bombs.<br> - Did you do any personnel work?<br> - No.<br> But as an officer you surely<br> had to act in an executive capacity,<br> you had to command men,<br> be responsible for the morale?<br> I was only responsible for<br> getting the bombs on the target.<br> - I didn't command anybody.<br> - I'm sure that required great skill.<br> But, unfortunately, we've no<br> opportunities for that with Midway Drugs.<br> Yeah.<br> We may be able to provide an opening as<br> assistant to Mr Merkel, the floor manager.<br> - "Sticky" Merkel?<br> - Clarence Merkel.<br> That's the fella. He was<br> my assistant at the soda fountain.<br> He's a very good man.<br> Incidentally, your work would require<br> part-time duties at the soda fountain.<br> - At what salary?<br> - 32.50 per week.<br> over $400 a month in the air force.<br> The war is over, Derry.<br> I think I'll look around, Mr Thorpe.<br> Thank you, very much.<br> And take care of that cold.<br> - I gotta run. I'll drop back later.<br> - All right, Fred. Bye.<br> Excuse me, girls.<br> No, conditions are none too good<br> right now, Al.<br> Considerable uncertainty in business.<br> Strikes. Taxes still ruinous.<br> - You like that cigar?<br> - Yes, Mr Milton. It's fine.<br> Hard to get those in the war, but they<br> come in regularly from Havana now.<br> Things will readjust themselves in time.<br> We want you back here with us, Al.<br> That's very nice of you, Mr Milton,<br> but I noticed Steese sitting at my old desk.<br> - I wouldn't want to push him out.<br> - Steese'll stay right there.<br> You're moving up.<br> What do you say to being vice president in<br> charge of small loans, at $12,000 a year?<br> What do you say to that, huh?<br> I... I'd say it can't be true.<br> Job's there, Al.<br> - You're the man for it.<br> - What makes you think I am, Mr Milton?<br> Well, your war experience<br> would prove invaluable to us here.<br> See, we have many new problems.<br> This GI Bill of Rights, for instance.<br> It involves us in consideration<br> of all kinds of loans to ex-servicemen.<br> We need a man who understands<br> the soldiers' problems,<br> and who's well grounded in the<br> fundamental principles of sound banking.<br> In other words, you.<br> Well? What do you say, Al?<br> Well, I'm... I'm overwhelmed.<br> Of course. Of course.<br> - Will you bring them in now, please?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - I'd thought of taking it easy...<br> - Naturally.<br> After what you've been through,<br> you need a vacation. Thank you.<br> You're entitled to enjoy life<br> before you come back to work.<br> - It's very kind of you to say that.<br> - When you get a chance...<br> This contains reports with all the figures<br> on our Small Loans Department.<br> Just in your spare time, of course.<br> Oh, the briefcase<br> is a slight gift from the bank.<br> Well, thank you.<br> Thank you very much, Mr Milton.<br> - Glad to have you back with us, Al.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Sweetheart, I knew you'd be heartbroken.<br> But listen, you can get another blonde.<br> What about Sylvia Mack?<br> (jazz on radio)<br> Oh, you're crazy.<br> I think her legs are cute.<br> I'm sorry too, but he doesn't<br> want me to work nights.<br> He says it's inconvenient.<br> Oh, he's wonderful. And how!<br> Snappy uniform, a whole<br> ribbon counter on his chest.<br> - Sure, I'll bring him in sometime.<br> - (door bell)<br> Hey, the door bell's ringing.<br> I guess that's my Freddy.<br> Bye.<br> Hey, Marie, have you got an extra key?<br> I'd like to have it.<br> - What are you looking at?<br> - Holy smoke, honey!<br> That's the first time I've ever seen you<br> in civilian clothes.<br> Well, from now on, honey,<br> you're not gonna see me in anything else.<br> I just got it out of the mothballs<br> over at Pop's house.<br> (music off)<br> I called up the Blue Devil.<br> - Who?<br> - The nightclub. I told 'em I'm through.<br> - Oh, swell.<br> - But let's go there for dinner.<br> I'd like to introduce you.<br> They've heard all about you.<br> Anything you say, honey.<br> Here's some perfume I bought in Paris.<br> Oh! Fleurette No. 5!<br> And this scarf's cute!<br> To think of having things from Paris!<br> Freddy, honey, you're just a big hunk<br> of heaven. What's that a picture of?<br> Bomb hits on Dsseldorf.<br> That's my B-17.<br> What are those?<br> - Little black flowers that grow in the sky.<br> - Huh?<br> - Hey, that's me!<br> - I had it pasted above my bombsight.<br> - It took a lot of trips over Germany.<br> - That's sweet.<br> The guys'd kid me about it. They'd take<br> a look at it and ask "Who's the dame?"<br> When I told 'em it was my wife they'd say<br> "Nobody's got a wife looks like that."<br> "What's her telephone number?"<br> When we go out<br> will you wear your uniform?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - For my sake.<br> - I'm sorry, baby.<br> - I'd be so proud to be out with you.<br> Won't you, please?<br> Well, seeing as it's you and seeing as I<br> can't find any place to hang it, all right.<br> But it's the last time.<br> If you don't like me in civilian clothes,<br> we'll just have to stay here all the time.<br> Would that be so bad?<br> You gotta get yourself some new clothes.<br> That suit's awful.<br> I know, it's terrible. But they tell me<br> you can't buy anything new now.<br> I know where you can get<br> snappy suits made to order.<br> - You mean there's a black market?<br> - If you know the right people,<br> and don't care how much you spend...<br> We're not worrying about that, baby.<br> I got money, cash money.<br> Nearly 1,000 bucks,<br> from the good old US Treasury.<br> Oh, now you look wonderful!<br> You look like yourself.<br> It's so wonderful,<br> I can hardly believe it.<br> Now we can have a real honeymoon,<br> without a care in the world.<br> Just as if nothing had ever happened.<br> Just as if you'd never gone away.<br> We're right back where we started.<br> - Don't say that, Marie.<br> - Don't say what?<br> That we're right back where we started.<br> We never wanna be back there.<br> But why not? What is it?<br> What's the matter?<br> Oh, never mind. Skip it. I went back to the<br> drugstore today and I just got reminded.<br> Come on, let's go out and have fun.<br> - Hello, Wilma.<br> - Good afternoon, Mr Parrish.<br> - Have you seen Homer?<br> - He's in the woodshed.<br> - (gunshot)<br> - He wants to practise shooting.<br> So he can go hunting.<br> You'd have thought he'd seen<br> enough shooting in the war.<br> I guess he just wants to find<br> something to occupy himself.<br> I guess so.<br> I wish there was something<br> I knew to do for him.<br> His mother and I have tried<br> to make him feel at home,<br> but he just keeps to himself all the time.<br> (gunshot)<br> (gunshot)<br> Hello, Luella.<br> What are you kids doing?<br> Nothing. We're just playing.<br> That's his girl. They're engaged.<br> (knock at door)<br> - Oh. Hello, Wilma.<br> - Hello.<br> - Looking for something?<br> - No. Go right ahead.<br> - How'd you do, Homer?<br> - Only fair.<br> Well, you did fine.<br> I'll do better.<br> I've been wanting to talk to you.<br> - What about?<br> - About everything. About us.<br> What about us?<br> We're all right, aren't we?<br> No. Listen to me, Homer.<br> I'm listening.<br> You wrote me that when you got home<br> you and I were going to be married.<br> If you wrote that once, you wrote it<br> Yes, but things are different now.<br> Have you changed your mind?<br> Have I said anything<br> about changing my mind?<br> No.<br> That's just it.<br> You haven't said anything about anything.<br> - That's not loaded, is it?<br> - Of course it isn't.<br> Don't you think I know<br> how to handle a gun?<br> I don't know what to think, Homer.<br> All I know is, I was in love with you when<br> you left and I'm in love with you now.<br> Other things may have changed,<br> but that hasn't.<br> You wanna see how the hooks work?<br> You wanna see the freak?<br> All right, I'll show you!<br> Take a good look!<br> I didn't mean anything, Homer.<br> I was only... (sobs)<br> I'm... I'm sorry, Luella.<br> It isn't your fault.<br> Go on and play with your friends.<br> (Luella sobbing)<br> I know, Wilma. I was wrong.<br> I shouldn't have acted like that.<br> It wasn't her that... burned my hands off.<br> I'll be all right.<br> I just gotta work it out myself.<br> - I could help you, Homer, if you'd let me.<br> - I've gotta work it out myself.<br> All I've wanted is for people<br> to treat me like anybody else,<br> instead of pitying me.<br> I guess it's hard for them to do that.<br> I've just gotta learn to get used to it<br> and pay no attention.<br> - Couldn't I...?<br> - No! I've gotta do it myself.<br> - Yes?<br> - OK, Pop, I'm going to bed now.<br> Be right with you, Homer.<br> - Night, son.<br> - Good night, Pop.<br> Thanks.<br> (jazz on radio)<br> (key in door)<br> - Hello, babe.<br> - What you got there?<br> Our supper. Cream of corn soup,<br> potato salad, salami and liverwurst.<br> We're going to Jackie's Hot Spot.<br> I made a reservation.<br> - We're eating at home.<br> - Are you sick or something?<br> No, dear. Broke.<br> - Broke?<br> - You got it.<br> Well, what happened?<br> Where did it go to?<br> We spent it, babe.<br> That's what happened.<br> I didn't tell you<br> the money was almost gone<br> because I kept hoping<br> I was gonna land a good job.<br> But I'm not going to get one,<br> so we'll have to forget about Jackie's Hot<br> Spot and the Blue Devil and all the rest.<br> Why couldn't you get a job?<br> Have you tried?<br> Sure. I've been all over town -<br> all the employment offices and the USES.<br> They say I ought to spend<br> a couple of years as an apprentice,<br> or go to a trade school.<br> A couple of years,<br> with you going to kindergarten.<br> And what would I be doing<br> in the meantime?<br> You can always help me<br> with my homework.<br> - Fred.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Are you really all right?<br> - Of course I'm all right. Why?<br> I mean, in your mind. Is anything...?<br> My mind?! You mean<br> you think I'm going goofy?<br> I've been wondering.<br> What was Gadowsky?<br> - Where did you hear about him?<br> - You talk in your sleep.<br> Something's on fire<br> and you want somebody to get out.<br> You keep saying "Gadowsky! Gadowsky!"<br> Gadorsky.<br> He was a friend of mine, a B-17 pilot.<br> He got it over Berlin.<br> - Can't you get it out of your system?<br> - Oh, sure(!)<br> The war's over. You won't get anyplace<br> till you stop thinking about it.<br> - Come on, snap out of it!<br> - OK, honey, I'll do that(!)<br> I didn't tell you, Fred,<br> but I got a little money saved.<br> Dinner's on me tonight.<br> You'd better keep on saving it.<br> It might come in handy sometime.<br> I appreciate the offer,<br> but we're eating at home.<br> Well, I'm hungry.<br> I'm going out by myself.<br> - You're not going. You'll eat what I cook.<br> - Let go of me!<br> When we married, the justice of the peace<br> said "For better, for worse". Remember?<br> - This is the "worse".<br> - When do we get the "better"?<br> When I get wise to myself, I guess.<br> When I realise I'm not an officer<br> and a gentleman any more,<br> I'm just another soda jerk out of a job.<br> Go and sit down and read a magazine or<br> listen to the radio while I cook the soup.<br> I'll fix you a nice meal, honey.<br> Just like I used to do behind<br> the fountain, before the war.<br> Perfume and Cosmetics<br> is our outstanding feature.<br> It accounts for 34/ of gross intake<br> and an even higher proportion of profits.<br> As you will surmise, our customers<br> in this department are women.<br> Yes, I'd surmised that.<br> You must familiarise yourself with the<br> correct pronunciation of all the perfumes.<br> - Rve Romantique.<br> - That means Romantic Dream.<br> - You speak French?<br> - Sticky, just enough to go to Paris bars.<br> Let's get one thing straight, Derry.<br> The name "Sticky" is out.<br> Yes, Mr Merkel. I understand.<br> This week we're pushing the new<br> Champagne Bubble Bath. $1.98.<br> Down here are some special... Come here.<br> Down here are some<br> specially made-up toilet sets...<br> - Thank you.<br> - Morning, Mr Latham.<br> - Morning.<br> - Good morning, Mr Stephenson.<br> What have we here?<br> The Bretton Woods Agreement(?)<br> That's a Mr Novak, waiting over there.<br> He's applying for a GI loan.<br> - Oh, good. I'll see him.<br> - Mr Novak.<br> - Sit down, Mr Novak.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Don't "sir" me, Mr Novak.<br> I'm a sergeant.<br> - I see you were in the navy.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I mean, yes, I was. In the Seabees.<br> Where'd you operate?<br> All over the Pacific.<br> One island after another.<br> What'd you do, mostly?<br> Go in before the landings and clear<br> the mines and underwater obstructions.<br> When they'd taken enough ground<br> for an airstrip we'd build it.<br> - Fairly interesting work, eh?<br> - No, it got monotonous.<br> Those islands all look alike.<br> Until lwo Jima. That was different.<br> So I've heard.<br> I see you have quite a family.<br> A wife and four children.<br> Yes. There'd have been more<br> if I hadn't been away three years.<br> - And now you wanna buy a farm.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Got my eye on a fine piece of property.<br> What about collateral?<br> - Collateral? What's that?<br> - Security for your loan.<br> What can you put up<br> in the way of property?<br> Have you any stocks and bonds?<br> Real estate? Valuables of any kind?<br> No, Mr Stephenson. You see, the point is,<br> I haven't got any property.<br> That's why I want the loan,<br> so I can get the property.<br> I see.<br> No collateral.<br> That makes things difficult.<br> I'm a good farmer, Mr Stephenson.<br> Why, even during the war<br> I kept my hand in.<br> I used to spend my spare time down on<br> those islands working truck gardens<br> so my outfit could have fresh tomatoes<br> and green corn and all that.<br> And before the war I was a sharecropper,<br> like my father before me.<br> And now, I feel I'd like to have<br> a little piece of my own to work.<br> - You like to grow things, eh?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And with the food shortage<br> all over the world,<br> farming's about the most<br> important work there is.<br> I mean... Well, don't you think so,<br> Mr Stephenson?<br> Yes.<br> You see, Mr Stephenson, I don't feel<br> this is asking the bank for a handout.<br> I feel it's my right. At least, that's what<br> I've been told by other ex-servicemen:<br> that the government<br> guarantees loans to us...<br> Your loan would be administered<br> through this bank,<br> which would put up<br> half of the $6,000 you require.<br> Now, that involves risk<br> for this bank, Mr Novak.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Al!<br> - Homer!<br> - Look at you!<br> - Look at you!<br> - So this is where you work.<br> - Sort of. Are you sticking up the bank?<br> Look, 200 leaves of cabbage. That's<br> what I get every month from now on.<br> - Pretty soft, eh?<br> - Pretty soft.<br> - You sure we haven't short-changed you?<br> - I kept my eye on the guy counting it out.<br> Did you know Fred Derry<br> had a job at the Midway Drugstore?<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - He introduced me to his wife.<br> - Yeah?<br> - (whistles) Some dish.<br> We'll all have to get together at Butch's.<br> - Fine. That's where I'm going now.<br> - Yeah?<br> - To take a piano lesson.<br> - You... Uh-huh?<br> Take one for me.<br> - See you later.<br> - So long, Homer.<br> Well, as I was saying, Mr Novak,<br> there is an element of risk involved.<br> We'll have to have the property appraised.<br> But you'll get your loan.<br> Say, Mr Stephenson,<br> I don't know how to begin to thank you.<br> Don't try. You look like<br> a good risk to me.<br> When the tomato plants start producing,<br> I want free samples.<br> - I'll tell you when the papers are ready.<br> - Thank you, sir. Thank you.<br> God bless you.<br> I've seen advertisements about this.<br> Night of Bliss.<br> Is it all that they say it is?<br> What do they say it is?<br> "Haunting, provocative, languorous."<br> Oh, yes, I'm sure it's all of those.<br> (wind-up toy whirring)<br> Dexter!<br> - Don't play with those toys, bud.<br> - My name ain't Bud!<br> - Dexter, stop that.<br> - I just wanted to see how it worked.<br> Sorry.<br> You heard what Mommy said.<br> Ooh, Seduction. How much is that?<br> This is... It's quite expensive.<br> It's 16.50. But it's a nice size.<br> You see what I mean?<br> - But it's a good, safe bet.<br> - Just what do you mean by that?<br> Well, I mean it's...<br> it's a perfume that fits any mood.<br> Oh!<br> - All right, I'll take it.<br> - Very good, madam.<br> Mommy! Mommy, look!<br> Bang, bang, bang, bang!<br> I shot it down! I shot it down in flames!<br> I'm very sorry... Oh, hello.<br> Hello.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I'll be with you in just a moment, madam.<br> Will you take this, please?<br> This lady will have your package<br> in a moment.<br> - Thank you very much. Come in again.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You were wonderful.<br> - I wanted to smack him.<br> It's against the rules to chat,<br> unless it's a sale.<br> Oh. All right, I'll buy something.<br> - What's this?<br> - Youth Recaptured, a complexion cream.<br> But you don't need<br> any of that phoney stuff.<br> That's vanishing cream.<br> This is a vanishing-cream remover.<br> I'll tell you how you can save money. If<br> you don't put that on, you don't need this.<br> How about some lotion?<br> Here's one at $2.98.<br> And you'd be overcharged<br> at half the price.<br> I didn't really come in to buy anything.<br> Dad told me you were working here.<br> I just dropped in to say hello.<br> Just a minute. I have...<br> I have an hour off at one o'clock.<br> Are you doing anything for lunch?<br> - Why, no.<br> - Thank you, madam.<br> I'll meet you outside in 20 minutes.<br> Come in again.<br> Thank you.<br> - The apple pie, she's homemade.<br> - Good.<br> Thank you.<br> It is a nice little place.<br> I never heard of it before.<br> I used to come here now and then<br> in the old days, before the war.<br> I used to think of this place<br> when I was overseas.<br> I thought "When I get back home I'm<br> never gonna eat in a dump like Lucia's."<br> What else did you think you wouldn't do?<br> I never had any clear ideas,<br> but there were two things I was sure of.<br> One, that I knew I'd never<br> go back to that drugstore.<br> What was the other thing?<br> That was even sillier.<br> I dreamed I was gonna have<br> my own home.<br> Just a nice little house for my wife<br> and me out in the country...<br> In the suburbs, anyway.<br> That's the cockeyed kind of dream<br> you have when you're overseas.<br> You don't have to be overseas<br> to have dreams like that.<br> Yeah. You can get crazy ideas<br> right here at home.<br> - You have to be back at work at two?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, hadn't you better...?<br> - Yeah. Check, please.<br> - 85c apiece for lunch, plus tax, is $1.76.<br> OK.<br> - Thank you very much. Goodbye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Goodbye, signorina. Come again.<br> - We'll do that. So long.<br> Arrivederci.<br> Well...<br> That shouldn't have happened.<br> But I guess it had to.<br> - Goodbye, Peggy.<br> - Goodbye.<br> We were discussing this loan<br> to this man... What's his name?<br> Novak.<br> Yes. Yes, I approved it.<br> May I ask, Al, on what basis?<br> On the basis of my own judgment.<br> Novak looked to me like a good bet.<br> But the man has no collateral, no security.<br> - Evidently, you saw something in him.<br> - Yes, Mr Milton.<br> - What was it?<br> - Security.<br> Collateral.<br> In the army I was with men stripped<br> of everything in the way of property<br> except what they carried around<br> with them and inside them.<br> I saw them being tested.<br> Some of them stood up to it, some didn't.<br> But you could tell<br> which ones you could count on.<br> I tell you, this man Novak is OK.<br> His "collateral" is in his hands, in his<br> heart, in his guts. In his right as a citizen.<br> - Nobody's denying him his rights.<br> - We are. If we deny him his chance...<br> Gentlemen, there's no need<br> to raise our voices.<br> Of course, since you've approved<br> the loan, the incident is closed.<br> - However, in the future, Al...<br> - Yes, I understand, Mr Milton.<br> In the future I must exercise more caution.<br> Thank you, Mr Prew.<br> Al, uh...<br> (door closes)<br> Al, you know how I feel<br> about you and always have.<br> Why, I've always considered you<br> one of the family, so to speak.<br> Like my own s... younger brother.<br> I picked you personally for this job,<br> and I know you'll make good.<br> We do have a desire to extend a helping<br> hand to returning veterans when possible.<br> But we must all remember that<br> this is not our money we're doling out.<br> It belongs to our depositors,<br> and we can't gamble with it.<br> I'll remember, Mr Milton.<br> We'll meet at the Union Club at 7.30.<br> - And give my best to your charming wife.<br> - Thank you, Mr Milton.<br> (key in door)<br> - Hello.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> Hurry and get dressed.<br> And wear your new suit.<br> We're going to dinner<br> at the Embassy Club.<br> Don't worry, it won't cost<br> a nickel. We got invited.<br> - Who invited us?<br> - Miss Peggy Stephenson.<br> She called up, said her father was a friend<br> of yours. She sounded like a nice kid.<br> She's going out with some boyfriend<br> and asked us on a double date, as guests.<br> - You told her we could go?<br> - You bet I did.<br> Well, call her up and tell her we can't go.<br> Tell her I made another engagement.<br> - Say, who is this Peggy Stephenson?<br> - She's a girl.<br> I didn't think she was a kangaroo.<br> Where'd you meet her?<br> The night I got back, Al Stephenson<br> and his wife took me home.<br> She's their daughter.<br> I'd never seen her before.<br> Or since?<br> If you wanna make anything out of this,<br> you'll be disappointed.<br> I just don't like accepting handouts.<br> You'd better get used to it, cos we won't<br> get much fun on your 32.50 a week!<br> Hold still!<br> You'll probably have to make a speech.<br> It's my plan to meet that situation<br> by getting well plastered.<br> - Peggy's going out with Woody Merrill.<br> - Who's he?<br> - You know, Bill Merrill's son.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Fine people, the Merrills.<br> Strictly TCR.<br> - What's that?<br> - Top credit rating.<br> - Are his intentions honourable?<br> - I doubt it.<br> But they're going to be chaperoned<br> by Fred Derry and his wife.<br> Fred Derry? Ha! Some chaperone!<br> - I think she's crazy about him.<br> - Who, Merrill?<br> No, Fred.<br> Have you got evidence<br> to support that amazing statement?<br> - Just a hunch.<br> - Oh.<br> But my hunches are pretty good.<br> - Ah! Cocktails!<br> - No, you don't.<br> I made this for Woody Merrill.<br> Surely you wouldn't deny your father<br> a drop on a cold night like this.<br> - I would if I could.<br> - I hear you're gonna see Fred, hm?<br> - Yes.<br> - What's his wife like?<br> I don't know. I'll tell you later.<br> They'll have cocktails at the Union Club.<br> I know the kind Mrs Milton serves:<br> pink, sweet and nauseating.<br> I was just asking Peggy about Fred's wife.<br> Never mind, Mom.<br> I know what you're both thinking.<br> What are we thinking?<br> You're afraid I may be in love with Fred.<br> - Why, I never had any such idea!<br> - Shut up, Al.<br> Are you in love with him?<br> Yes.<br> But I don't want to be.<br> That's why I asked him and his wife<br> to go out with us this evening.<br> I think it ought to have<br> a very healthy effect on me.<br> Once I get to know her, I...<br> I'm sure I'll stop being silly<br> about the whole thing.<br> (door bell)<br> We don't need to worry about that child.<br> She can take care of herself.<br> That's what she thinks.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - You know my father.<br> - Mr Stephenson.<br> - Nice to see you again. Have a drink?<br> - Thank you.<br> I've played golf with your father.<br> - Been to the club since you got back?<br> - I haven't had a chance.<br> - Al, we'll be late.<br> - Right.<br> - Good night.<br> - Night.<br> - Have a good time, children.<br> - Thank you.<br> Give my best to Fred.<br> Al, come on!<br> Yes, Mr Milton!<br> - Hello, Peggy.<br> - Oh, Woody, don't be a bore.<br> We'll be late.<br> Our country must stand today<br> where it has always stood,<br> the citadel of individual initiative,<br> the land of unlimited opportunity for all.<br> It is peculiarly appropriate<br> that we meet here tonight to honour one<br> who has valiantly fought for that freedom.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, we greet<br> our friend, our co-worker, our hero,<br> Al Stephenson.<br> Come on, on your feet, Al.<br> On your feet.<br> (applause)<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I'm very happy to be here.<br> In fact, I'm very happy to be anywhere.<br> In fact, I'm very happy!<br> Perhaps it'd be a good idea if you just<br> put that bottle down right here.<br> - Save yourself quite a number of trips.<br> - Good old Al! (polite laugh)<br> (ripple of laughter)<br> I'm glad to see<br> you've all pulled through so well.<br> As Mr Milton so perfectly expressed it,<br> our country stands today...<br> where it stands today. Wherever that is.<br> I'm sure you'd all agree with me if I said<br> that now's the time to stop this nonsense,<br> face facts, get down to brass tacks,<br> forget about the war, and go fishing.<br> But I'm not gonna say it.<br> I'm just going to sum the<br> whole thing up in one word.<br> (clears throat)<br> My wife doesn't think I'd better<br> sum it up in that one word.<br> The reason for my success as a sergeant<br> is due primarily to my previous training<br> in the Cornbelt Loan and Trust Company.<br> The knowledge I acquired<br> in the good old bank<br> I applied to my problems in the infantry.<br> For instance, one day in Okinawa,<br> a major says "You see that hill?"<br> I said "Yes, sir. I see it."<br> "All right," he said.<br> "You and your platoon will attack<br> said hill and take it."<br> So I said "But that operation<br> involves considerable risk."<br> "We haven't sufficient collateral."<br> "I'm aware of that", said the major, "but<br> you are the guys who are going to take it."<br> So I said to him "I'm sorry, Major.<br> No collateral, no hill."<br> So we didn't take the hill,<br> and we lost the war.<br> Uh, I think that little story<br> has considerable significance.<br> But I've... I've forgotten what it is.<br> Uh...<br> And now, in conclusion,<br> I'd like to tell you a humorous anecdote.<br> I know several humorous anecdotes, but<br> I can't think of any way to clean 'em up!<br> - (ripple of laughter)<br> - So I'll only say this much.<br> I love the Cornbelt<br> Loan and Trust Company.<br> Some say that the bank is suffering from<br> hardening of the arteries and of the heart.<br> I refuse to listen to such radical talk.<br> I say that our bank is alive,<br> it's generous, it's... it's human!<br> And we're going to have<br> such a line of customers<br> seeking and getting small loans<br> that people will think we're gambling<br> with the depositors' money.<br> And we will be!<br> We'll be gambling on<br> the future of this country.<br> I thank you.<br> (? swing)<br> Woody, I can't take it any more.<br> Let's sit down.<br> We can't get out. I'm trapped.<br> How do you do? Ow!<br> Beg your pardon!<br> Well, anyway, we can't fall down.<br> - Is that table satisfactory?<br> - Everything's lovely.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Would you care to order now?<br> Sorry.<br> - I can't understand it.<br> - What?<br> Why you're not mad about me.<br> I think I'm attractive.<br> You are, Woody. You're irresistible.<br> Then why do you go on resisting me?<br> All marriages don't have<br> to be like that one.<br> - Which one?<br> - Your friends, Fred and Marie.<br> - What's wrong with their marriage?<br> - Nothing, except one slight detail.<br> They just don't like each other.<br> It's murder on the dance floor. It's awful!<br> - You don't wanna dance any more?<br> - Love to! You don't mind if I borrow him?<br> No, not at all.<br> - Why did you do this, Peggy?<br> - Do what? What do you mean?<br> Calling up Marie<br> and going out like this. Together.<br> - I did it deliberately.<br> - Why?<br> To prove to myself that what happened<br> this afternoon didn't really happen.<br> But it did happen.<br> It had to happen.<br> And if we go on seeing each other, Peggy,<br> it'll happen again.<br> ? Be-bop a-ree-bop<br> ? Be-bop...<br> Excuse us.<br> Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> We want to have a picture taken<br> in a few minutes.<br> Fine. I'll be here.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Hello, Marie.<br> - Good evening.<br> - You got to watch yourself. More wolves!<br> - I know.<br> I'd pay no attention to the sign.<br> Go right in!<br> - Gee, Woody's a cute boy.<br> - He's a lot of fun.<br> He's got dough, too.<br> His family own half the city.<br> He has a terrific yen for you.<br> I don't want to butt into your affairs, but<br> if you take my advice, you'll grab Woody!<br> Woody and I are good friends,<br> but there's no romance.<br> Never mind the romantic part. That takes<br> care of itself. I speak from experience.<br> They'll tell you money isn't everything.<br> Maybe it isn't but, boy, how it helps!<br> While Fred was away<br> I was drawing over $500 a month.<br> I mean, from his army pay<br> and the job I had.<br> Now the two of us gotta live on what Fred<br> gets from the drugstore. 32.50 a week!<br> Poor Fred. Bet you think he's a sourpuss.<br> He didn't used to be that way, though.<br> Army's had an awful effect on him.<br> Knocked all the life out of him!<br> Fred isn't going to be satisfied<br> with that job at the drugstore.<br> - He'll get something better.<br> - Maybe in five years he'll draw 50 bucks.<br> You can't have happy marriages<br> on that kind of dough.<br> You know, Peggy, you're cute.<br> But you could use a little more make-up.<br> And get yourself a better hairdo.<br> I'll give you the name of my hairdresser.<br> Oh, but you've got nothing to worry about.<br> You'll get Woody and live<br> happily ever after. It's in the bag!<br> Thank you.<br> Now, everybody get in close together,<br> put our arms around each other.<br> Come on, Fred. I don't mind.<br> Ooh! Wait, I'll tell you when.<br> Everybody, happy. Let's all be talking.<br> What a marvellous party.<br> We'll have to do this again.<br> OK, shoot the picture!<br> We want four copies, honey.<br> Mr Milton certainly acted enthusiastic<br> about your speech.<br> Yeah, sure. That's how<br> he acted, the old hypocrite.<br> - Suppose he'll fire you in the morning?<br> - No, he'll never do anything impetuous.<br> He'll back me up, till the next time<br> I give a loan to some little guy.<br> - Then I'll have to fight it out again.<br> - (knock at door)<br> - Yes?<br> - It's me, Peggy.<br> Oh, come in, darling.<br> - Did you have a good time?<br> - Not very.<br> Ah, what's all this? Children's Hour?<br> (belches) I beg your pardon.<br> Well? What's she like?<br> I'm glad I went out with them.<br> Even though it was<br> a disagreeable experience.<br> It took guts, honey.<br> But you got plenty.<br> I'll need them.<br> I've made up my mind.<br> - Good girl.<br> - To do what?<br> I'm going to break that marriage up.<br> I can't stand seeing Fred tied<br> to a woman he doesn't love.<br> And who doesn't love him.<br> It's horrible for him. It's humiliating,<br> and it's killing his spirit.<br> Somebody's got to help him.<br> - Are you sure he doesn't love her?<br> - Of course I am.<br> Did he tell you?<br> - Did she?<br> - No.<br> So you just jumped to conclusions!<br> He doesn't love her, he hates her.<br> I know it.<br> - I know it.<br> - Who are you, God?!<br> How did you get this power<br> to interfere in people's lives?<br> Is Fred in love with you?<br> Yes.<br> - You've been seeing him?<br> - Only once. Today.<br> Oh, it was all perfectly respectable.<br> But when we were saying goodbye, he...<br> he took me in his arms<br> and kissed me and...<br> and I knew.<br> You think a kiss from a smooth operator<br> like Fred means anything?!<br> You don't know him. You don't know<br> anything about what's inside him.<br> Neither does she. His wife.<br> That's probably what she thought -<br> a smooth operator<br> with money in his pockets.<br> But now he isn't smooth any longer,<br> and she's lost interest.<br> Whereas you're possessed<br> of all the wisdom of the ages(!)<br> You can see into the secret recesses<br> of his innermost soul(!)<br> I can see because I love him.<br> So you're gonna break this marriage up.<br> Have you decided how?<br> Are you gonna do it with an axe?<br> It's none of your business<br> how I'm going to do it!<br> You've forgotten<br> what it's like to be in love!<br> Hear that? I'm so old and decrepit, I've<br> forgotten how it feels to want somebody.<br> Peggy didn't mean that.<br> Did you, darling?<br> No.<br> I don't know what I do mean.<br> It's just that everything has<br> always been so perfect for you.<br> You loved each other<br> and you got married in a big church<br> and you had a honeymoon<br> in the South of France.<br> You never had any trouble of any kind.<br> So how can you possibly understand<br> how it is with Fred and me?<br> We never had any trouble?<br> How many times have I told you<br> I hated you and believed it in my heart?<br> How many times have you said you were<br> sick of me, that we were all washed up?<br> How many times have we had to<br> fall in love all over again?<br> I'm sorry, Mom.<br> Never mind about that, darling.<br> - (Al) Fred.<br> - Hiya, Butch.<br> - Hello, Fred.<br> - Al here?<br> - He's back there, waiting for you.<br> - See you later.<br> - Hiya, Al.<br> - Sit down, Fred.<br> - What are you drinking?<br> - A cup of coffee. Gotta have a clear head.<br> - A cup of coffee and a bourbon and soda.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What's on your mind, Al? Want to<br> borrow some money or something(?)<br> I, uh... called you to ask you a question.<br> OK. Shoot.<br> Are you in love with Peggy?<br> - Is there a law compelling me to answer?<br> - No.<br> Nevertheless, I repeat:<br> are you in love with Peggy?<br> Yes.<br> I thank you for a short and honest answer.<br> You're welcome.<br> Now what do we take up next?<br> Your wife. What about her?<br> Where does she fit<br> in this romantic situation?<br> Is that any of your business?<br> That's what Peggy said -<br> that it's none of my business.<br> Oh, you've had her on the carpet, too.<br> She volunteered some information<br> to her mother and me.<br> You see, we have a rather unusual<br> relationship in our family.<br> It may seem corny and mid-Victorian,<br> but we tell each other things.<br> I happen to be quite fond of Peggy, and I...<br> You don't want her mixed up with a heel.<br> I haven't called you a heel. Yet.<br> I just don't want to see her<br> get into this mess.<br> OK, chum, what do we do now?<br> Step out and settle this thing in the alley?<br> I wouldn't want to recommend<br> that as a solution.<br> I've learned to fight dirty.<br> If I got tangled up with you,<br> I might break your neck.<br> I wouldn't like that.<br> - You see, I'm quite fond of you, too.<br> - Thanks.<br> But I don't like the idea of you<br> sneaking around corners to see Peggy,<br> taking her love on a bootleg basis.<br> I give you fair warning, I'll do everything<br> I can to keep her away from you,<br> to help her forget about you and get her<br> married to a guy who'll make her happy.<br> Then I guess that's it, Al.<br> I don't see her any more.<br> I'll put that in the form of a guarantee.<br> I won't see her any more.<br> I'll call her up and tell her so.<br> - That satisfy you?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Anything else on your mind?<br> - No.<br> OK, chum. So long.<br> So long, Fred.<br> The drinks are on me.<br> - Hello, Homer.<br> - Hi, Steve.<br> Say, Al Stephenson's back there.<br> - Al?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hi, Al.<br> - Hello, Homer.<br> - How are you?<br> - Fine, thanks.<br> - Hello, Homer.<br> - Hi, Butch.<br> - Say, let's show Al that new routine.<br> - Sure.<br> Got something to show you, Al.<br> Well, come on.<br> - Boy, wait till you hear this.<br> - All set, kid?<br> - I'm ready when you are.<br> - OK. One, two, three.<br> (? "Chopsticks")<br> That's fine!<br> What's the matter?<br> Didn't you like it, Al?<br> Sure, it was swell. I thought you were<br> kidding about the piano lessons.<br> Fred! Hey, Fred!<br> That was Fred.<br> Yeah.<br> - Is anything wrong?<br> - No, he had to go back to the drugstore.<br> Come on, Homer, buy me a drink.<br> Who was it?<br> Fred.<br> He said he's sorry for what happened,<br> but it was just one of those things.<br> He said it wouldn't be fair to his wife for<br> us to see each other any more because...<br> I'm obviously the kind of girl<br> that takes these things too seriously.<br> Then he said goodbye,<br> very politely, and hung up.<br> Well, I guess you and Dad<br> won't have to worry about me any more.<br> That's the end of my career<br> as a home-wrecker.<br> Mom, I know you feel sorry for me.<br> You think my poor little heart is broken.<br> But you can save your sympathy.<br> I can see things clearer now.<br> I made a fool of myself.<br> I'm getting some sense<br> hammered into me now.<br> I'm glad I'm out of that mess.<br> I'm glad I'll never see him again! I...<br> Two chocolate sundaes coming up.<br> What about a ham and cheese<br> on whole-wheat?<br> Ham and cheese coming up.<br> - Here you are.<br> - (delighted whistle)<br> Thank you.<br> - Hello, Homer. How've you been?<br> - Hi, Fred.<br> - Glad to see you.<br> - Say, Fred.<br> - Yeah?<br> - What happened at Butch's?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - You and Al. Was there any trouble?<br> Oh, no. We were just having<br> a little friendly chat.<br> - There you are, sir.<br> - Thanks.<br> - What'll yours be, Homer?<br> - Oh, I don't care. A chocolate sundae.<br> OK.<br> Hi.<br> - How are you, soldier?<br> - Sailor.<br> Excuse me.<br> Say, uh... do you mind if<br> I ask you a personal question?<br> I know what it is. How did I get<br> these hooks, and how do they work?<br> That's what everybody says when they<br> start off "Mind if I ask you a question?"<br> Well, I'll tell you. I got sick and tired<br> of that old pair of hands I had.<br> An awful lot of trouble,<br> washing them and manicuring my nails.<br> So I traded them in<br> for these latest models.<br> They work by radar. Look.<br> - Pretty cute, eh?<br> - You got plenty of guts.<br> It's terrible when you see a guy like you<br> that had to sacrifice himself. For what?<br> - For what?! I don't get you, mister.<br> - Well...<br> - Anything else for you?<br> - Check.<br> We let ourselves get sold down the river.<br> We were pushed into war.<br> Sure, by the Japs and the Nazis.<br> The Germans and the Japs<br> had nothing against us.<br> They wanted to fight<br> the limeys and the Reds.<br> They would've whipped 'em, too, if we<br> didn't get deceived into it by Washington.<br> What are you talking about?<br> We fought the wrong people, that's all.<br> Just read the facts, my friend. Find out for<br> yourself why you had to lose your hands.<br> - Then go out and do something about it.<br> - You'd better pay your check and go.<br> - Well, who do you think you are?<br> - Pay the cashier right over there.<br> - Coffee, please.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> There's another thing. Every soda jerk in<br> this country's got an idea he's somebody!<br> What are you selling anyway?<br> I'm not selling anything<br> but plain old-fashioned Americanism.<br> Some Americanism!<br> So we're all a bunch of suckers?<br> So we should've been on the side<br> of the Japs and the Nazis?<br> Again I say, just look at the facts.<br> I've seen facts. I've seen a ship go down,<br> and 400 of my shipmates went with it.<br> Were those guys suckers?!<br> That's the unpleasant truth,<br> and the sooner we get wise to it...<br> - Ooh, if I only had my hands!<br> - You put those down!<br> Take your hands off him!<br> (Merkel) May I get through, please?<br> - Go get the druggist.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Make way, please.<br> What happened?<br> - It was Fred Derry. He hit him.<br> - Bring some iodine and bandages.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Don't say it, chum.<br> The customer's always right, so I'm fired.<br> But this customer wasn't right.<br> I'll meet you outside in a minute, kid.<br> Gee, Fred, I'm sorry I lost you your job.<br> But that guy...<br> Yeah, I know. You read about guys like<br> that, but you don't often see 'em, luckily.<br> How about your girlfriend - Wilma?<br> - You and she gonna get married?<br> - I don't know.<br> Why don't you know?<br> Doesn't she want to get married?<br> It isn't Wilma's fault.<br> She's been swell about it.<br> - So then it's your fault?<br> - Yeah, I... I guess it is.<br> - Will you do me a favour, Homer?<br> - Sure, Fred. What is it?<br> I'm a hot one to be giving advice<br> to the lovelorn, but go see Wilma - now.<br> Take her in your arms, kiss her,<br> ask her to marry you, then marry her.<br> Tomorrow, if you can get a licence.<br> If you want anybody to stand up for you at<br> your wedding... There's my bus. So long.<br> So long, Fred.<br> - You all right?<br> - I'm just going to get a glass of milk.<br> Just knock on the door<br> when you want me.<br> OK.<br> Wilma! What are you doing out this hour?<br> I saw you were up, Homer.<br> I saw you through the window.<br> I've got to talk to you.<br> All right, come in.<br> - Want some chicken?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Sure?<br> - Yes.<br> - Want a glass of milk?<br> - No, thanks, Homer.<br> Sit down, Wilma.<br> Homer, I... My family want me<br> to go away, tomorrow.<br> - Where?<br> - Up to Silver Lake. My Aunt Vera's place.<br> That ought to be nice.<br> But I don't want to go.<br> I want to stay here.<br> You see, the reason they want me to go<br> is so that I'll forget about you.<br> They figure you don't want me around,<br> you don't want to see me,<br> and if I go away for a while,<br> maybe I'll get all this out of my mind.<br> Maybe that's a good idea, Wilma.<br> Maybe you ought to do that.<br> Do you want to get rid of me?<br> Tell me the truth, Homer.<br> Do you want me to forget about you?<br> I want you to be free, Wilma.<br> To live your own life.<br> I don't want you tied down forever<br> just because you've got a kind heart.<br> Homer, why can't you understand the way<br> things really are? The way I really feel?<br> I keep trying to tell you.<br> But... but you don't know, Wilma.<br> You don't know what it'd be like<br> to have to live with me,<br> to have to... face this<br> every day, every night.<br> But I can only find out by trying.<br> If it turns out I haven't courage enough,<br> we'll soon know it.<br> Wilma, you and I have been close<br> to each other for a long time, haven't we?<br> Ever since we were kids.<br> Yes, Homer.<br> I'm going upstairs to bed.<br> I want you to... I want you to come up<br> and see for yourself what happens.<br> All right, Homer.<br> I've learned how to take this harness off.<br> I can wiggle into my pyjama top.<br> I'm lucky, I have my elbows.<br> Some of the boys don't.<br> - But I can't button 'em up.<br> - I'll do that, Homer.<br> This is when I know I'm helpless.<br> My hands are down there on the bed.<br> I can't put them on again<br> without calling to somebody for help.<br> I can't smoke a cigarette or read a book.<br> If that door should blow shut,<br> I can't open it and get out of this room.<br> As dependent as a baby that doesn't know<br> how to get anything except cry for it.<br> Well, now you know, Wilma.<br> Now you have an idea of what it is.<br> I guess you don't know what to say.<br> It's all right. Go on home.<br> Go away, like your family said.<br> I know what to say, Homer.<br> I love you.<br> And I'm never going to leave you.<br> Never.<br> You mean, you... you didn't mind?<br> Of course not.<br> I told you I loved you.<br> I love you, Wilma.<br> I always have, and... and I always will.<br> Good night, darling. Sleep well.<br> Good night, Wilma.<br> Hey, sugar. You'd better step on it,<br> or your husband'll be home.<br> He's job-hunting.<br> He won't come home for another hour.<br> - And what if he does?<br> - I don't understand it.<br> All this money around and he can't<br> get into it. What's wrong with him?<br> - I guess he just isn't very bright.<br> - (key in door)<br> How do you do?<br> Fine, thanks. Who are you?<br> Fred, I want you to meet Cliff Scully,<br> an old friend of mine.<br> - Hiya, Freddy.<br> - Glad to know you, Scully. Get out.<br> - A tough guy, huh?<br> - Now listen, Fred.<br> You won't get anywhere with<br> that attitude. Cliff's an old friend.<br> He's asked me out, and I'm going out.<br> - You heard me, chum. Get out.<br> - What do I do next? Smack him?<br> Why ask her?<br> Can't you think for yourself?<br> Go on. I can handle this.<br> Wait for me downstairs.<br> OK.<br> Another ex-serviceman, huh?<br> Greetings. Have you had<br> any trouble getting readjusted?<br> Not in particular. It's easy if you<br> just take everything in your stride.<br> That's what I've heard.<br> - Be seeing you.<br> - I doubt it.<br> - When did you pick him up?<br> - He's an old friend.<br> He just dropped in for a friendly drink.<br> - Did you know him while I was away?<br> - I knew lots of people.<br> - What do you think I did all those years?<br> - I don't know, but I can guess.<br> Go ahead, guess.<br> I could do some guessing myself.<br> What were you up to in London<br> and Paris and all those places?<br> I've given you every chance to make<br> something of yourself. I gave up my job.<br> I gave up the best years of my life!<br> And what have you done? You've flopped.<br> Couldn't even hold a job at the drugstore.<br> So I'm going back to work for myself.<br> And I'm going to live for myself, too.<br> And in case you don't understand English,<br> I'm gonna get a divorce.<br> What have you got to say to that?<br> Don't keep Cliff waiting.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - I'm going away.<br> - Where?<br> - As far away from Boone City as I can get.<br> That's a good idea.<br> You'll get a good job someplace else.<br> There are drugstores everywhere.<br> Here's an old sweater<br> I found. Remember?<br> - Sure.<br> - You might need it sometime.<br> - Thanks, Hortense.<br> - You forgot these, son.<br> - Oh, I don't want 'em, Pop.<br> - What are they?<br> Fancy words that don't mean anything.<br> You can throw 'em away.<br> Say, these are citations for your medals.<br> Why, Freddy,<br> you never showed them to us.<br> Those things came in<br> the packages with K rations.<br> Well, we'll treasure them, my boy.<br> I'll get the socks I washed for you.<br> Think you're doing the right thing, son?<br> Going? Who's to say in advance whether<br> it's the right thing or the wrong thing?<br> It just means a fresh start<br> in some other place.<br> How do you know<br> it'll be different anyplace else?<br> There's a need here for fellas like yourself<br> that fought and won the war.<br> I know you haven't had the best of breaks<br> since you got back, but...<br> you ought to stick here and slug it out<br> a while longer on your own home ground.<br> You're all right, Pop.<br> But I know when it's time to bail out.<br> I gotta get going.<br> - Here are your clean socks, Fred.<br> - Just put 'em in here.<br> - Take good care of the old man.<br> - I'll do my best.<br> - But we'll miss you, Freddy.<br> - You ought to be used to that by now.<br> So long, Pop.<br> We've got two flights going out of here<br> tonight. One eastbound, one westbound.<br> You'll have to ask the pilot.<br> Which way you going?<br> Which one leaves first?<br> Eastbound. Eight o'clock.<br> That'll be fine. I'll just<br> hang around the field until then.<br> You don't seem to care<br> where you're going.<br> That's right, chum. I don't.<br> Hortense.<br> Hortense!<br> Listen to this. Sit down.<br> "Headquarters, 8th Air Force.<br> Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross."<br> Um... Here.<br> "Despite intense pain,<br> shock and loss of blood,<br> with complete disregard<br> of his personal safety,<br> Captain Derry crawled<br> back to his bombsight,<br> guided his formation<br> on a perfect run over the objective<br> and released his bombs<br> with great accuracy."<br> "The heroism, devotion to duty,<br> professional skill and coolness under fire<br> (voice wavers)<br> displayed by Captain Derry,<br> under the most difficult conditions,<br> reflect highest credit on himself and<br> the Armed Forces of the United States."<br> "By command of<br> Lieutenant General Doolittle."<br> (imaginary plane engines)<br> (man) Hey, bud,<br> what are you doing up there?<br> Hey, you!<br> What are you doing in that airplane?<br> - I used to work in one of those.<br> - Reviving old memories, huh?<br> Or maybe getting some of 'em<br> out of my system.<br> Well, take your last look.<br> We're breaking 'em up.<br> Yeah, I know. You're the junkman.<br> You get everything sooner or later.<br> This is no junk. We're using this material<br> for building prefabricated houses.<br> You don't need any help, do you?<br> - Out of a job?<br> - That's it.<br> I see. One of the fallen angels<br> of the air force.<br> Well, pardon me if I show no sympathy.<br> While you glamour boys were up in the<br> wild blue yonder, I was down in a tank.<br> Sometime I'll be glad to hear<br> the story of your war experiences.<br> What I asked you for was a job.<br> Have you got one?<br> - Do you know anything about building?<br> - No. But I know how to learn.<br> Same as I learned that job up there.<br> - Hey, Gus.<br> - Yes?<br> See if you think this guy<br> can be of any use to us.<br> Thanks.<br> Now, children, let's remember the words.<br> The bride will come down those stairs.<br> When I see her I'll hit the first note,<br> then I'll nod my head<br> and then we'll sing, huh?<br> All right, let's try it.<br> - Here she comes.<br> - ? Here...<br> Wait for the note.<br> ? Here's comes the bri...<br> That's fine.<br> (door bell)<br> - Mrs Cameron?<br> - Yes. Mrs Stephenson?<br> - Yes.<br> - Come right in, won't you?<br> - My daughter.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do, Mrs Cameron?<br> - How do you do?<br> - There you go.<br> - You shouldn't have.<br> - My daughter.<br> - Miss Stephenson.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Mr Cameron.<br> Meet Homer's folks.<br> Mr and Mrs Stephenson.<br> Miss Stephenson.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Hello, Al.<br> - Hello, Butch!<br> - It's good you're here.<br> - Mr Stephenson, punch?<br> Hello, Butch.<br> - How do you do, Mrs Stephenson?<br> - How do you do?<br> Steady, boy!<br> (chuckles)<br> I heard you were leaving town. I was<br> afraid you wouldn't stand up for me.<br> I'll stand up for you, kid, till I drop.<br> Oh, Fred, here's the ring.<br> Don't lose it.<br> - Hiya, Homer. Big day, huh?<br> - Hi, Al.<br> - Hiya, Fred.<br> - Hello, Al.<br> I, uh... I hear you moved back<br> with your folks.<br> Yeah.<br> I've sampled the punch.<br> I presume it was made for the kiddies.<br> - Will you have some, Homer?<br> - I might give the wrong answers.<br> - How about you, Fred?<br> - No, thanks. Maybe later.<br> Well, if I must be a solitary drinker,<br> good luck, kid.<br> - Thank you, Al.<br> - Al! You promised you wouldn't.<br> - Take a sip of this.<br> - Hello, Fred. Homer.<br> - There isn't a headache in a barrel of it.<br> - Al can take it.<br> - He certainly can.<br> - Excuse me.<br> See for yourself.<br> Hello, Fred. Nice to see you again.<br> Hello, Peggy. Nice to see you.<br> Well, what have you been doing<br> with yourself lately?<br> Working.<br> Yes... Dad told me he heard<br> you were in some kind of building work.<br> Well, it's a hopeful way of putting it.<br> I'm really in the junk business.<br> An occupation for which many people<br> feel I'm well qualified,<br> by temperament and training.<br> It's fascinating work.<br> - Where's Homer? Wilma's ready.<br> - I'll get him.<br> Excuse me.<br> Mary, Kay, go ahead.<br> Jackie. Jackie!<br> Over here.<br> Watch me.<br> ? Here comes the bride<br> ? All dressed in white<br> ? Sweetly serene<br> in the soft, glowing light<br> ? Lovely to see<br> ? Marching to thee<br> ? Sweet love united<br> ? For eternity<br> Dearly beloved, we are gathered together<br> here in the sight of God and this company<br> to join together this man and this woman<br> in holy matrimony.<br> If any man can show just cause why<br> they may not lawfully be joined together,<br> let him now speak, or else hereafter<br> forever hold his peace.<br> Homer, wilt thou have this woman<br> to thy wedded wife?<br> I will.<br> Wilma, wilt thou have this man<br> to thy wedded husband?<br> I will.<br> Who gives this woman<br> to be married to this man?<br> I do.<br> Now, Homer, will you take Wilma's<br> right hand in yours and say after me:<br> I, Homer, take thee, Wilma,<br> to my wedded wife.<br> I, Homer, take thee, Wilma,<br> to my wedded wife.<br> To have and to hold from this day forward.<br> To have and to hold from this day forward.<br> For better, for worse.<br> For richer, for poorer.<br> For better, for worse.<br> For richer, for poorer.<br> In sickness and in health. To love<br> and to cherish till death us do part.<br> In sickness and in health. To love<br> and to cherish till death do... us do part.<br> Now, Wilma, with your right hand, take<br> Homer by his right hand and say after me:<br> I, Wilma, take thee, Homer,<br> to my wedded husband.<br> I, Wilma, take thee, Homer,<br> to my wedded husband.<br> To have and to hold from this day forward.<br> To have and to hold from this day forward.<br> For better, for worse.<br> For richer, for poorer.<br> For better, for worse.<br> For richer, for poorer.<br> In sickness and in health. To love<br> and to cherish till death us do part.<br> In sickness and in health. To love<br> and to cherish till death us do part.<br> The ring.<br> Place it on the fourth finger<br> of Wilma's left hand.<br> Repeat after me:<br> With this ring, I thee wed.<br> With this ring, I thee wed.<br> Those whom God hath joined together,<br> let not man put asunder.<br> For as much as Homer and Wilma<br> have consented together in holy wedlock<br> and have witnessed the same<br> before God and this company,<br> and thereto have given and pledged<br> their troth, each to the other,<br> and have declared the same by giving and<br> receiving a ring, and by joining hands,<br> I pronounce that they are man and wife.<br> God bless you both.<br> You know what it'll be, don't you, Peggy?<br> It may take us years to get anywhere.<br> We'll have no money,<br> no decent place to live.<br> We'll have to work, get kicked around...<br> Stephanie Donohue<br> ENHOH<br>
