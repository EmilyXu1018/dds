I'm exhausted.<br> Good night, everyone.<br> I'll be up in a minute.<br> Good night, Sarah.<br> Harold, I'm sorry.<br> We all feel that way.<br> I forget what this is like.<br> In L.A., I don't know who to trust.<br> I feel like everybody<br> wants something from me.<br> I know that sounds terrible,<br> but it's true.<br> Tell me about it.<br> It's a cold world out there.<br> Sometimes I think<br> I'm getting frosty myself.<br> I don't know what people<br> think about me.<br> I don't know why they like me,<br> or even if they do like me.<br> You don't have<br> that problem here.<br> You know I don't like you.<br> Me either.<br> Ditto.<br> So relax.<br> Assholes.<br> I was just coming down.<br> Don't.<br> What are we doing?<br> I didn't get to talk to you before.<br> You got me stoned too quick.<br> But I'm okay now.<br> I'm just drunk and therefore brave.<br> I've always been<br> a cowardly drunk myself.<br> I bought the land three years ago.<br> He and Chloe were working on it.<br> There's an old house they were fixing up.<br> It's really pretty. I can take you<br> out there tomorrow if you want.<br> That's what I don't get.<br> It's one of the things I don't get.<br> He was really<br> involved in that.<br> It seemed to really mean<br> something to him.<br> I went with him three weeks ago<br> to buy a table saw.<br> Why does he do a thing like that?<br> I should've known.<br> - How could you know?<br> - Nobody knew.<br> I can't even believe it now.<br> I don't care.<br> I should've known.<br> All I want is a little warmth.<br> What?<br> Sweetheart?<br> Did I ever tell you...<br> ...what happened to me in Vietnam?<br> It's a fucking bat, and I think<br> it touched my hair!<br> I hate them!<br> They're like rats with wings.<br> No, pigeons are rats with wings.<br> - They're harmless. They eat mosquitos.<br> - I'm going to wash my hair and puke.<br> - Puke first, of course.<br> - Stand aside!<br> That's cashmere!<br> Give me that.<br> I'll be right bat.<br> Where'd it go?<br> Listen for it.<br> It makes weird sound.<br> Kind of:<br> It's quiet in here.<br> It's too quiet.<br> Shit!<br> Look out, Nick!<br> Behind you.<br> Here, let me open this.<br> Maybe it'll split.<br> All right!<br> Okay, now we got a fair fight.<br> Keep your mouth shut.<br> I'll do the talking.<br> You can't go in there.<br> I told you never to<br> walk in here without knocking.<br> What's this?<br> I'm not sure.<br> What's it about?<br> I don't know.<br> Who's that?<br> I think the guy in the hat<br> did something terrible.<br> - Who wants to be next?<br> - Like what?<br> You're so analytical.<br> Sometimes you just have to let art...<br> ...flow over you.<br> I'm hungry.<br> I had this really dirty dream.<br> Was it about Karen?<br> - Why do you say that?<br> - Why should anything have changed?<br> You're the one she always wanted.<br> In the old days, I wasn't emotionally<br> equipped to satisfy her.<br> Now the equipment doesn't<br> work at all.<br> Why do we have to talk about that?<br> Come on in the kitchen with me.<br> I think she found what she was<br> looking for in Richard.<br> Be careful what you want,<br> young lady...<br> ...or you will surely get it.<br> What're you doing up?<br> Why didn't you come in?<br> I didn't realize anybody else was up.<br> I've been thinking<br> about your friend Alex.<br> Did you ever meet him?<br> Karen's told me some.<br> I'm imagining mostly.<br> I never sleep through the night.<br> Insomnia. Karen doesn't know.<br> I might have something<br> that can help.<br> No, thanks.<br> I don't mind it.<br> Sometimes when my family's asleep,<br> I sit downstairs and it's so quiet.<br> I hate not being able to sleep,<br> but I don't mind the time alone.<br> Sometimes I think the thing about kids<br> is their instant priorities.<br> You know you must<br> protect and provide for them...<br> ...and sometimes it means your life<br> isn't exactly how you want it to be.<br> There's some...<br> ...asshole at work you<br> have to kowtow to...<br> ...and sometimes you do things<br> you never thought you'd do.<br> But you try to<br> minimize that stuff...<br> ...and be the best person<br> you can be.<br> But you set your priorities.<br> And that's the way life is.<br> I wonder if<br> your friend Alex knew that.<br> He couldn't live with it.<br> I know I shouldn't talk.<br> You guys knew him.<br> But the thing is...<br> ...nobody said it was<br> going to be fun.<br> At least nobody said it to me.<br> You can't run in those shoes.<br> I'll get you some good shoes.<br> I'm about to tell you something I'm<br> not supposed to tell anyone.<br> Then maybe you shouldn't.<br> I already told Alex.<br> Look what happened to him.<br> In a few months, a very large<br> corporation...<br> ...a conglomerate, is going to<br> buy my very small company.<br> Anyone who has our stock<br> will triple their money.<br> That's how Alex could afford<br> to buy the land.<br> I was thinking you could use<br> the information...<br> ...to get into another line of work.<br> You never learn, do you?<br> By telling you, I've violated about 16<br> regulations...<br> ...of the Securities Exchange<br> Commissin.<br> So please don't repeat it.<br> Repeat what?<br> I loved Alex.<br> What happened between<br> him and Sarah...<br> ...hurt, I can't deny that.<br> But that was five years ago.<br> We all got over it.<br> I think they felt as bad as I did.<br> You know...<br> ...they only slept together<br> a few times.<br> But in a way, their affair<br> had been going on since Ann Arbor.<br> She didn't marry Alex.<br> You'll explain everything?<br> I'll explain to them.<br> Have a safe trip.<br> That's the trouble with these.<br> You must watch them every minute.<br> Did I miss Karen and Richard?<br> Nope.<br> Just Richard.<br> Karen's staying the weekend.<br> But not Richard?<br> Went back to be with the kids.<br> That's interesting.<br> How did Richard feel about it?<br> If you sleep this late,<br> you'll miss a few mini-dramas.<br> I just hope you'll wake me<br> for anything ugly.<br> How do actors learn all those lines?<br> How do you remember them?<br> My wife used to run them with me,<br> but now my maid does.<br> - Your maid?<br> - That's how she learned English.<br> Sarah says to make three<br> of those milks nonfat.<br> Sure you don't mind this?<br> I'll never remember that.<br> Will you?<br> I don't know.<br> If we'd gotten married, we'd<br> go shopping like this.<br> No, if we'd gotten married,<br> I'd be doing this alone.<br> No, I did not say that, Molly.<br> I said we'll see.<br> I don't have to<br> explain it, young lady.<br> I want you to do it because I said so.<br> Understand?<br> When you're a mother you can be mean.<br> All right, you can do that.<br> Tell Carmelina I said it's okay.<br> I love you, sweetheart.<br> Daddy will call you later.<br> Sometimes I don't believe<br> what I hear myself saying.<br> So you came back from Vietnam...<br> ...a changed man.<br> Well, why don't you just<br> tell everybody?<br> Then, in 1972...<br> ...you returned to the University of<br> Michigan...<br> ...to enter the doctoral program<br> in psychology.<br> But you couldn't seem to<br> finish that dissertation.<br> I could have. I chose not to.<br> I'm not hung up on<br> this completion thing.<br> Then you had many jobs,<br> all of which you quit.<br> What are you getting at?<br> I was evolving.<br> I'm still evolving.<br> But your real fame came<br> as a radio psychologist...<br> ...on KSFO in San Francisco.<br> I wouldn't call it fame exactly.<br> I had a small...<br> ...deeply disturbed following.<br> What are you doing...<br> ...now?<br> Or I should say,<br> what have you evolved into now?<br> Oh, I'm in sales.<br> What are you selling?<br> I don't have to answer that.<br> We're leaving.<br> Have you seen Chloe?<br> We're on the air here.<br> Sorry.<br> Sorry, pal. Got to go.<br> Just answer that last question.<br> I said, "I've got to go."<br> So what happened to your partner?<br> He wasn't my partner.<br> He had the idea for the club.<br> He's out of it now.<br> We weren't conducive.<br> We got together and hypered<br> each other into a frenzy.<br> His wife left for a younger woman,<br> he couldn't make love.<br> He was hospitalized for<br> being such a nerd.<br> So he's out of it?<br> Yeah, he's out. It's just me,<br> looking for investors.<br> Alex and I made love the night<br> before he died. It was fantastic.<br> He went out with a bang,<br> not a whimper.<br> They're either married or gay.<br> If they're not gay, they've broken up<br> with the most wonderful woman...<br> ...or they've broken up with a bitch<br> who looks like me.<br> They're in transition from a monogamous<br> relationship and need space.<br> Or they're tired of space,<br> but can't commit.<br> Or they want to commit<br> but are afraid to get close.<br> They want to get close and you don't<br> want them near.<br> Can't be that bad.<br> You don't know.<br> I've been out there dating<br> for 20 years.<br> I know in the first 15 seconds<br> if there's a chance in the worid.<br> At least you're<br> giving them a fair shot.<br> Easy for you to say.<br> Married to Harold, the perfect man.<br> Sometimes I think I don't<br> want a man anymore.<br> So here I sit on my<br> ticking biological clock.<br> The only thing I've known my entire life<br> is that I want to have a child.<br> Don't remind me.<br> It was the right thing to do at the time.<br> So what do you do?<br> I'm going to have a baby.<br> What?<br> She was young when<br> Robin and I divorced.<br> Now she has a new father.<br> Sometimes I think it's confusing<br> to her when I'm around.<br> I don't know.<br> - I don't need it.<br> - God knows I don't.<br> - We should think of the others.<br> - Don't want to be selfish.<br> I know Sarah and Meg would<br> want some of this Fudge Royale.<br> They have no self-control.<br> And the Cherry Nugget too, I think.<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe I don't want to<br> give her the time.<br> Could I be that big an asshole?<br> It's one giant toilet.<br> Maybe you should put a spot like<br> this in your club.<br> It will be big.<br> You should take it more seriously.<br> You'd have your own table<br> waiting at all times.<br> I'm considering it.<br> I've always wanted my own table.<br> Now, I'd have a chair too, right?<br> Remember senior year we were all going to<br> buy that land near Saginaw?<br> What happened with that?<br> We didn't have any money.<br> That's when property was a crime.<br> You know, it's raining.<br> It's nice, isn't it?<br> Nice.<br> You're not afraid of snakes, are you?<br> You're a doctor.<br> Doctors know everything.<br> Be supportive for a minute and<br> shut up.<br> I've been taking my temperature<br> and I know I'm ovulating.<br> The ground is ready.<br> I need someone to plant the seed.<br> Who's going to be the lucky farmer?<br> These are the best guys I know.<br> My favourite men in the worid.<br> Unfortunately, I found out Nick is<br> no longer a candidate.<br> Michael's a possibility,<br> but I think as a fallback position.<br> So to speak.<br> So that leaves Sam.<br> - Harold's not good enough for you?<br> - Are you kidding? I'd love it.<br> But I couldn't ask that of you.<br> Anyway, Harold's got enough kids.<br> That's very considerate.<br> Too bad Richard left.<br> Have you and Sam discussed it, or<br> are you planning a surprise attack?<br> Why should he have a problem with it?<br> There won't be obligations.<br> I love him as a friend.<br> I assume he loves me.<br> He'd do anything for me.<br> Somehow I feel it isn't quite<br> this simple.<br> For one thing, it doesn't<br> always happen the first time.<br> That's not what they told<br> us in high school.<br> This is great.<br> This is really great.<br> Alex loved this place.<br> I can understand it.<br> It's terrific.<br> You remind me of Alex.<br> I ain't him.<br> Nobody thinks they're<br> a bad person.<br> I don't claim people<br> think they do the right thing.<br> They may know they do<br> dishonest or manipulative things...<br> ...but think there's a good reason<br> for it.<br> They think it'll turn out<br> for the best.<br> If it turns out best for them, it<br> is by definition what's best.<br> You also come up against<br> a question of style.<br> My style may be too direct.<br> Perhaps given my style<br> I seem more nakedly...<br> ...opportunistic or jerky or...<br> What was the other thing?<br> - Manipulative?<br> - Whatever.<br> All that's happening is<br> I'm trying to get what I want.<br> Which is what we all do, but<br> their styles are so warm...<br> ...you don't realize<br> they're trying to get what they want.<br> So my transparent efforts<br> are more honest and admirable.<br> Why does this sound<br> like a massive rationalization?<br> Don't knock rationalization.<br> Where would we be without it?<br> I don't know anyone who can go a day<br> without 2 or 3 rationalizations.<br> They're more important than sex.<br> Nothing's more important than sex!<br> Ever gone a week<br> without a rationalization?<br> What's your shoe size?<br> Six and a half.<br> Still the best way to determine<br> if it's ready.<br> - Meg, what's your shoe size?<br> - Who wants to know?<br> What, it's about a six and a half?<br> It used to be, but now it's seven.<br> - Your feet grow as you get older.<br> - I wish everything did.<br> How much longer?<br> Everything's getting cold.<br> After 12 years you haven't<br> learned to make anything else?<br> - I've improved on it.<br> - Now it's edible?<br> - The meal is ready. Let's go.<br> - J.T. Lancer!<br> Let's go watch this incredible show!<br> Oh, my God!<br> Come on, Sam.<br> Jesus.<br> Look at that hunk of man, kids.<br> He's so handsome.<br> Jesus!<br> Look out!<br> You forgot your Dramamine.<br> - Turn that off.<br> - No, it's great!<br> Does the suit<br> come with the machete?<br> You're dashing.<br> Dashing!<br> Why are you doing this to me?<br> You look great!<br> There she is.<br> I interviewed this girl.<br> Where is this?<br> I'm going to Hollywood.<br> "I want a Margarita now!"<br> Kids, don't try that at home.<br> That's a warning.<br> Watch out for that stick shift!<br> - Two at once?<br> - He's done a lot of pec work.<br> My favourite part!<br> Here it is.<br> - Say, baby, let's eat.<br> - Come on, big guy!<br> - The pasta's ruined now.<br> - You get money when that airs?<br> One thing I do want is<br> a Cosmic Invaders game for my trailer...<br> ...so Nick and I can watch it<br> and kick back.<br> - What? I don't want to hear this.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Video games?<br> You relax with video games?<br> Don't knock video games.<br> I let you guys out of sight and you<br> develop moronic interests.<br> Don't knock morons.<br> Would you prefer we got<br> into heavy drugs?<br> That might be better.<br> No offense, Nick.<br> He should be here.<br> I feel like we should've<br> had a chair for Alex.<br> Of course, we don't have<br> enough food.<br> This is all so familiar.<br> I love you all so much.<br> That sounds gross, doesn't it?<br> No, it doesn't.<br> I feel I was at my best<br> when I was with you people.<br> I know what you mean.<br> When I lost touch with this group...<br> ...I lost my idea of what I should be.<br> Maybe that's what happened to Alex.<br> We expected something of each other then.<br> We needed that.<br> Not me.<br> Getting away from you people<br> was the best thing to ever happen to me.<br> I mean, how much sex, fun,<br> friendship can one man take?<br> Had to get out in the worid,<br> get dirty.<br> No, I think Sam is right.<br> There was something in me then...<br> ...that made me want to go to Harlem<br> and teach ghetto kids.<br> I was going to help the scum, as I so<br> compassionately call them now.<br> Some of them are scum.<br> Some of us are scum.<br> So what's the thrust here?<br> We were great then and we're shit now?<br> I don't buy that.<br> That's not what we're saying.<br> I don't know.<br> I'd hate to think it was all just...<br> ...fashion.<br> What?<br> Our commitment.<br> It wasn't.<br> We accomplished things.<br> - All evidence to the contrary.<br> - You're just taking a position.<br> Sometimes I think<br> I've put that time down...<br> ...just so I can live with<br> how I am now.<br> Help me with these bleeding hearts.<br> I know what Alex would say.<br> What?<br> What's for dessert?<br> I'm not cynical about dessert.<br> - Want to load the dishwasher?<br> - I'd be thrilled.<br> I think I've just been too slow<br> to realize...<br> ...that people our age with histories<br> like ours...<br> ...having gone through the same stuff...<br> ...could be dishonest, unprincipled,<br> backstabbing sleazeballs.<br> Could have told you that<br> a long time ago.<br> I was prejudiced in their favor.<br> I thought because they look like us...<br> ...and talked like us they would<br> think like us.<br> I know that Richard<br> will always be faithful to me.<br> That's nice.<br> A little trust.<br> Fear of herpes.<br> It's not right.<br> Alex is still warm.<br> Can't blame Chloe.<br> She's a kid.<br> Michael hasn't changed.<br> Wait.<br> What?<br> Ever meet Michael's girlfriend,<br> Annie?<br> She's great.<br> She teaches the fourth grade.<br> Still teaching in Harlem.<br> It's not right.<br> I can't keep my eyes open.<br> I don't want to<br> go to bed, but I must.<br> - You really don't want to?<br> - I must.<br> But you don't...<br> ...want to?<br> Come with me.<br> What?<br> You want me to what?<br> Come on, Sam.<br> Don't make me say it again.<br> You've given me a massive headache.<br> You're not going to<br> use that old excuse, are you?<br> You've got good genes.<br> Where'd Chloe go?<br> She's coming right back.<br> No, I'm not in the mood.<br> Wait a minute.<br> What is that, a lude?<br> You want it?<br> Do you take a half?<br> Full stomach, I'd take a whole.<br> Right, I'm sure you would.<br> What the hell. L'Chaim!<br> There's a shift in your<br> perceptions of the world.<br> Forever you're responsible for another<br> living thing.<br> It's wonderful.<br> But it's a huge commitment.<br> A commitment that has nothing to do...<br> ...with legal names<br> and legal obligations.<br> I'm sorry, Meg.<br> I'd love to help you but I can't.<br> You know, you're something.<br> I love you.<br> - Really, I can't.<br> - I accept that!<br> I mean, I really love you.<br> You're a nice person.<br> Really?<br> So you want to fuck?<br> Just kidding!<br> Then one day I was driving home.<br> They were running a tape<br> of one of my shows.<br> I heard myself talking<br> to someone who had called up.<br> Someone in real pain.<br> I listened for about 45 seconds.<br> And I'm talking...<br> ...like I know them and understand...<br> ...and have something<br> useful to say about their lives.<br> The worst part was they<br> believed me.<br> I quit the next day.<br> You helped me.<br> I was 15 and my family was<br> living in Oakland.<br> And I used to<br> listen to you every night.<br> One night I called you up.<br> I was upset and thought<br> something was wrong with me.<br> - Like I was a pervert.<br> - What did I say?<br> That I'd be okay if I did<br> my homework...<br> ...and went to bed at a reasonable hour.<br> You were right. It was okay.<br> You helped.<br> I don't want to discuss this now.<br> Why? You have more people<br> to tell about the stock thing?<br> It's really a charming side of you.<br> Remind me to<br> get more cocaine tomorrow.<br> If you tell everyone about the stock deal,<br> it will blow up in your face.<br> Who will you tell next? Michael?<br> He came down here to find investors for<br> that moronic club of his.<br> - He came down for Alex's funeral.<br> - Maybe.<br> You are in no condition<br> to discuss this now.<br> You can't change people's lives!<br> Who do you think you are,<br> John Beresford Tipton?<br> I'm going to sleep.<br> How can you go to sleep?<br> I'm not even tired.<br> Some say suicide is<br> the ultimate act of self-absorption.<br> Alex didn't commit suicide.<br> It was an accident.<br> That's right, he was shaving.<br> Alex had hairy wrists.<br> Masturbation's the ultimate act<br> of self-absorption.<br> You jerk off?<br> Does a bear have fleas?<br> No, does a bear<br> shit in the woods?<br> Does a bear jerk off?<br> I shit in the woods,<br> but I can't jerk off.<br> We're trying to avoid<br> dealing with Alex.<br> Every time it comes up,<br> someone changes the subject.<br> It's a dead subject.<br> I get real tired of these jokes.<br> What are we afraid of?<br> To show our emotions?<br> Are we mad at him for<br> leaving no explanations?<br> I could say something funny<br> about that. But I won't.<br> Great, they got here early.<br> Thanks, Toby.<br> I appreciate it.<br> Yes, sir, Mr. Cooper.<br> It was my pleasure.<br> Yes, sir, Mr. Cooper. Sir.<br> Give me a break, that's my name.<br> Mr. Weber.<br> So you just fell asleep?<br> That's what I just said,<br> didn't I?<br> About five times.<br> I didn't know him in the biblical sense.<br> Is that clear?<br> I don't know why you're touchy.<br> I don't know why you're curious.<br> These feel great.<br> I'm never taking these off.<br> I will sleep in them.<br> Which doesn't mean he'll<br> have sex with them.<br> Is there any salt and pepper, please?<br> What do you think about<br> this latest brainstorm of Michael's?<br> I'm not sure I want to be part owner<br> of a jet-set greasy spoon.<br> Think we could<br> stall him for a while?<br> What is that?<br> Nick wanted to<br> take a look at the property.<br> He'll be back before<br> the game starts.<br> Thanks.<br> Are we the first ones up?<br> You remember.<br> Alex used to call me Sam the Sham.<br> Don't say that.<br> It was real.<br> I stood with thousands of people<br> listening to you. You moved them.<br> Now I reach<br> millions of people every week.<br> Hell, it's just garbage.<br> That's not true.<br> You entertain people.<br> God knows, we need that now.<br> I try.<br> I try once every show<br> to put something of value in there.<br> - But I don't know.<br> - You do.<br> I can see it.<br> I feel my kids have<br> gotten something from J.T. Lancer.<br> Really?<br> Kids.<br> There you go.<br> You've done something.<br> You and Richard have<br> built something for yourselves.<br> You know the secret of Richard?<br> Remember my father?<br> I didn't want that<br> to happen to me.<br> Richard looked like all that<br> had been missing in my childhood.<br> A man like that could<br> build a stable environment for children.<br> And he did.<br> It's just that now...<br> What?<br> Well, you know.<br> Tell me.<br> Well, it's not like<br> talking to you.<br> All my life, deep inside...<br> ...I felt there was something I wanted<br> to express...<br> ...but always felt, I don't know,<br> stymied.<br> I'm proud of what I did.<br> I'm doing a good job of raising my sons.<br> If it meant giving up<br> my writing, that's the way it goes.<br> - You don't remember my writing.<br> - Sure I do.<br> It's just poems and short stories.<br> I didn't show it to many people.<br> Why talk about it?<br> I made my decisin.<br> My children come first.<br> It's just that now it leaves<br> kind of a...<br> ...I don't know, a space.<br> And all of Richard's...<br> ...country clubs and home improvements<br> and business deals...<br> ...are pretty superficial stuff.<br> I'm not complaining.<br> Well, maybe I am.<br> Sorry.<br> It's just...<br> ...being with you...<br> ...opens me up somehow.<br> Forgive me?<br> Hail to the conquering heroes.<br> Come on, the game's starting!<br> You don't want to miss<br> any of the Blue.<br> Yes, you do, all right.<br> And you were ready to write<br> this one off at 10-0.<br> - I didn't say anything about that.<br> - I saw that smile.<br> That pass, I can't believe it.<br> Go, go, go!<br> A flag? What?<br> What are they calling that?<br> - What is that?<br> - Clipping.<br> That was a clean hit.<br> - He clipped him.<br> - What are you talking about?!<br> Clipping.<br> Called against Michigan.<br> Sorry, Chloe.<br> Come on, Blue, you're not supposed to<br> fold till the fourth quarter.<br> Don't heckle Bo.<br> He's got enough pressure.<br> Where is Nick?<br> I can't believe he's missing this.<br> Teach them the basics, Bo.<br> Ugliest helmets in the worid.<br> I don't know.<br> Sometimes I wonder<br> if I was sick of being a good girl.<br> I could be counted on<br> to do the right thing.<br> It's a disgusting curse.<br> Probably thought Alex could touch<br> that part of me...<br> ...that was unpredictable and magic.<br> The part I was always afraid of.<br> Who knows if it's even there?<br> When it was over, everything<br> went back to how it was before.<br> That's what we all agreed.<br> That's what we all said.<br> I was sorry everyone knew, but that was<br> as much my fault as anything.<br> Of course...<br> ...things weren't really the same.<br> Alex withdrew from me then.<br> I was probably different with him.<br> We never wanted Harold to think that...<br> You can imagine.<br> So we finally consummated<br> this ancient lurking passin.<br> All it had done was<br> put up a wall in our friendship.<br> What?<br> He's not passing!<br> Nobody in the area.<br> Who was he passing to?<br> I'm sure you're happy.<br> He threw it right to you!<br> Idiot!<br> They're flying up a new quarterback<br> from Texas or something.<br> What? I didn't throw the ball.<br> So what am I, chopped liver?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - You know.<br> - No, I don't.<br> - You know.<br> You asked Sam.<br> What is this, published somewhere?<br> You know we can do it.<br> We've done it.<br> Remember the march on Washington?<br> Armies of the night?<br> I remember.<br> I thought you'd be grateful.<br> - You're sweeping me off my feet.<br> - I thought you wanted a kid.<br> Thank you, Michael.<br> This is a big decisin.<br> I'll get back to you<br> in the third quarter.<br> Look at this! This could be us!<br> The next generation.<br> It could be.<br> Think about it.<br> Think!<br> Shit.<br> - How you doing, Harold?<br> - Not bad.<br> This guy claims to be a guest.<br> That true?<br> Depends.

Like what?<br> - Say anything.<br> Tell us about your past.<br> - I lived with Alex.<br> - Before that.<br> Before that.<br> Randy.<br> I don't like talking<br> about my past as much as you guys do.<br> Okay, I'll buy that.<br> Can you tell us<br> something about Alex?<br> Well, he was cute.<br> He said we made a good couple because I<br> had no expectations and he had too many.<br> He believed in reincarnation.<br> He never ate meat.<br> He said he was afraid<br> he would come back someday as a steak.<br> He said he should have<br> accepted that Rutledge fellowship.<br> What's the matter, Nick?<br> Two, three, four.<br> The biggest mistake I made was not<br> trying harder to steal you from Nick.<br> You know I always<br> wanted you to try.<br> I never got that feeling.<br> I guess you weren't<br> paying attention.<br> It's a little late now, isn't it?<br> Is it?<br> What are you saying?<br> I think you know.<br> I think you've known<br> this whole weekend.<br> Wait, you mean you and Richard...?<br> See?<br> You've always been able to read me.<br> You know my life with Richard<br> isn't working.<br> Well, I knew you two<br> weren't exactly...<br> But I didn't think-<br> I'm going to leave him.<br> Let's get the Wonton Express rolling.<br> You want to come along?<br> No, you go ahead.<br> I'll be right here.<br> Just climb in there regular, okay?<br> Listen to those guys.<br> Goddamn!<br> Remember the night we<br> saw them in Cobo?<br> No, you probably don't.<br> You were hallucinating<br> pretty bad that night.<br> We didn't even have any drugs.<br> Have you noticed anything<br> unusual about this weekend?<br> Other than Alex dying?<br> I've been getting<br> some pretty weird propositions.<br> I don't think I could<br> live down here all the time.<br> Last year I went to Hawaii<br> with my friend Reena.<br> We ate at a Chinese restaurant.<br> When they brought the fortune cookies...<br> ...hers said,<br> "You'll never amount to anything."<br> I don't believe it.<br> "Friendship is the bread of life..."<br> Wait a minute!<br> "...but money is the honey."<br> It doesn't say that.<br> - You're kidding.<br> - That's great!<br> Even fortune cookies<br> are getting cynical!<br> Cynical?<br> It's pragmatic.<br> I think it's touching.<br> There's nothing I'd rather<br> do right now than make love to you.<br> When it's over...<br> ...come into my life.<br> You and your kids<br> come out to L.A., move into my house.<br> There's plenty of room.<br> It's lovely, it's great.<br> I can't do that.<br> It has to do with Robin.<br> No, it's not that.<br> My marriage is completely over.<br> When Robin and I broke up,<br> I had a million good reasons.<br> A million things that<br> were wrong with her, wrong with us.<br> When I think back on it now...<br> ...and see my daughter with her new<br> father, I realize what broke us up.<br> What really did it,<br> and I hate to admit it, even now.<br> What did it was...<br> ...boredom.<br> I couldn't stick with it.<br> I'd hate to see you<br> make that same mistake.<br> You're a much better person than that.<br> Don't give me that shit!<br> For 15 years, you've acted like<br> I'm the one you really wanted.<br> You made sure everyone knew.<br> And now I come down here-<br> Don't be mad at him, honey.<br> Well, it's called an anus.<br> I'm sure it is boring to<br> hear it 20 times, but just ignore him.<br> All right.<br> Yes. Just a minute.<br> She's right here.<br> No, just hold on.<br> Hello, muffin.<br> How are you?<br> You got it? Great!<br> You did?<br> When I saw it, I said I have one friend<br> in the worid who'd appreciate it.<br> That's going<br> to be our little secret.<br> As soon as your<br> mommy and daddy say you can.<br> When do you get off from school?<br> So what would that have meant?<br> What do you mean?<br> It would've told us something.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Meg is pissed off because<br> Alex didn't leave a note.<br> - Could he summed it up in a note?<br> - Maybe a long note.<br> I can sum up<br> people's lives in 32 paragraphs.<br> I did a rock band in a page and a half<br> and they had 2 drummers.<br> Do you think this is funny?<br> One of our best friends<br> kills himself and we don't know why.<br> No one knows why anyone does anything.<br> Why did I choose these socks today?<br> Your socks, Alex's death.<br> They're pretty sad socks.<br> I believe that<br> everybody does everything to get laid.<br> Who said that? Freud?<br> No, I did.<br> All I'm saying is how could we<br> let Alex slip away like that?<br> Maybe he let us slip away.<br> I never heard from him.<br> - Did he hear from you?<br> - I tried. He resisted.<br> It's true.<br> We saw him a lot.<br> But he didn't tell us much.<br> Not me anyway.<br> I can't speak for Sarah.<br> I knew he was unhappy.<br> That doesn't tell you much.<br> I had no idea how bad it was.<br> I think he<br> wanted to cut off from us...<br> ...because he was so unhappy<br> with where he was at.<br> Is that true, Chloe?<br> Did you feel that?<br> I don't know.<br> We had some good times.<br> I haven't met many happy people<br> in my life. How do they act?<br> I'm sitting here and I realize...<br> ...I don't know what he<br> did for the last 5 years.<br> I remember he left<br> that caseworker job in Boston.<br> That was, what, '78 or so?<br> I don't know why he was doing that.<br> He was a scientific genius.<br> Why was he doing welfare work?<br> Then the construction job.<br> What was that for?<br> He didn't know what to do.<br> I can relate to that.<br> If you'd been in touch with him,<br> you could've saved his life?<br> You have that effect on people?<br> Keep them all jolly, do you?<br> Wise up, folks.<br> We're alone out there.<br> And tomorrow we're<br> going out there again.<br> It was straight of him not to cook up<br> a Reader's Digest condensation...<br> ...of his screwed up life<br> for our entertainment.<br> I am sick of people<br> selling their psyches for attention.<br> He was classier than that.<br> It was a real classy act<br> he pulled in the bathtub.<br> For some people it isn't a question<br> of why kill yourself, but why not.<br> Give me a break.<br> Spare us the tragic existential pose.<br> Didn't mean<br> to get into your area.<br> Come on now, guys.<br> We're all friends here.<br> This is a well-known dynamic.<br> I've seen it a million times.<br> Some people...<br> ...ease the pain of separation by<br> denigrating their relationship.<br> You're so deep.<br> I think Michael's right.<br> I feel shitty<br> about 10 different ways tonight.<br> I don't want<br> to let any of this go.<br> That's healthy. The only way to avoid<br> pain is to pretend you don't care.<br> I know. I've left<br> more places than you'll ever go.<br> Give him your pose line, Sam.<br> There's the existential man for you.<br> You're one tough cookie.<br> I could say you're one...<br> ...cold, manipulative guy and it<br> wouldn't bother you.<br> I'm deeply hurt.<br> At least our last night will be fun.<br> Please don't do this, guys.<br> This is happening because we miss him.<br> And we're really hurting.<br> That's a crock of shit!<br> We're afraid<br> just the opposite is true.<br> Alex died for most of us<br> a long time ago.<br> I think you're a crock of shit.<br> Don't speak<br> for me or anybody else.<br> You hate your life.<br> That's your problem.<br> - Don't tell us how we feel, okay?<br> - That's it.<br> That's all I'm saying.<br> If I hate my life, it's my problem.<br> Too bad you weren't around<br> to comfort Alex as compassionately.<br> We go back a long way.<br> I won't piss that away<br> because you're higher than a kite.<br> A long time ago we knew<br> each other for a short period.<br> You don't know anything about me.<br> It was easy then.<br> No one had a cushier berth than we did.<br> It's not surprising our<br> friendship could survive that.<br> It's only here in the world<br> that it gets tough.<br> I don't care what you say.<br> I know I loved you<br> and everybody else here.<br> And I'll go on<br> believing that till I kick.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> What's happened to you?<br> Wait!<br> I believe you can help other people.<br> I really do.<br> Sorry about that.<br> I do too.<br> Not that you can<br> save them, probably not.<br> But you can do what you can do.<br> That's how I feel.<br> So lay into me now.<br> Really let me have it.<br> I was just trying<br> to keep the conversation lively.<br> So you'll continue<br> to love me no matter what?<br> Just don't cross me.<br> Could you help me<br> in here for a sec?<br> Well, I think I've had enough.<br> I love you very much.<br> I'm yours.<br> I want you to do<br> something for me.<br> Anything.<br> I'd marry you, if you want.<br> No, wait. I did that.<br> Yes, you did.<br> Thank God.<br> It's about Meg.<br> Where to?<br> You know, I don't do anything.<br> It's me.<br> Come on in.<br> Nobody else will.<br> This bed has always<br> been lucky for Sarah and me.<br> I got to try and relax.<br> I think I just<br> forgot how to do it.<br> What, what?<br> It's not going to come out right.<br> Try me.<br> I feel like I got<br> a great break on a used car.<br> I remember this.<br> I remember when he got this.<br> I must tell you...<br> ...I'm picking up vibrations<br> here at the house.<br> I'm almost certain<br> there's sex going on around here.<br> Have I ever<br> told you how beautiful your eyes are?<br> My head.<br> Your feet.<br> Tell me about the club.<br> Fuck the club.<br> I couldn't deal with the hours.<br> It'd be nothing but aggravation.<br> Let's say it becomes successful.<br> I become a star.<br> People magazine sends<br> a nasty schmuck like me...<br> ...to do interviews. Big deal.<br> Nope. I'm going back to my novel.<br> I'll write<br> about this weekend.<br> What were you going to<br> write about before?<br> Last weekend.<br> If Richard and I<br> bring the boys to L.A...<br> ...maybe you could<br> get us in to see a studio.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Absolutely.<br> No problem.<br> Good.<br> Richard would like that.<br> I'm the worst about writing.<br> But I promise I will,<br> from now on, answer your letters.<br> - Great.<br> - Good morning, youngsters.<br> So how did everybody<br> sleep last night?<br> Did anybody sleep last night?<br> I know I did.<br> All alone in my airplane.<br> No co-pilot.<br> I slept like a baby. Even wet the bed.<br> Drink your coffee, Michael.<br> I'll come see you<br> whether you like it or not.<br> Well, good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> How you doing?<br> Don't have to be<br> in such a good mood.<br> Look what I found in Alex's papers.<br> I will be in Detroit<br> sometime on this deal...<br> ...and I'm just dying<br> to meet your boys.<br> I'd love it.<br> - You're all welcome in New York.<br> - Great!<br> Not in my apartment, you understand.<br> But in the city.<br> I'll accompany you anywhere,<br> even to Elaine's.<br> Thought Elaine's was dead.<br> That's why I can<br> get you guys in.<br> What's that?<br> The column I wrote about Alex<br> when he turned down the fellowship.<br> This is not bad.<br> Good, clean style.<br> Lean, economical, the right touch<br> of ideological fanaticism.<br> I remember Alex<br> was angry about that.<br> What do you mean?<br> I made him famous.<br> Think he saved<br> it because he hated it?<br> He also saved<br> his induction notice.<br> I'm collecting addresses.<br> Do you have one?<br> Or should I copy down<br> your license plate?<br> You can reach<br> Nick here for a while.<br> Nick and Chloe will stay here<br> and do some work at the old house.<br> I guess there's a certain<br> symmetry to that.<br> What's the flight schedule here?<br> Is there any way...<br> ...to coordinate<br> the airport transport?<br> I'll be glad to drive somebody.<br> Great, if we can take Harold's car.<br> Get Harold to drive it.<br> You're no fun.<br> That won't be necessary.<br> We took a secret vote.<br> We're not leaving.<br> We're never leaving.<br>
