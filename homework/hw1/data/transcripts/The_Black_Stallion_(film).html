He'll be here.<br> He probably doesn't even remember us.<br> - He'll be here.<br> - We're ancient history.<br> l tell you, he's gonna be here.<br> He's busy.<br> He's a little jumpy.<br> Come on. We'll work him.<br> Get him out there.<br> Henry!<br> - You okay?<br> - Where'd he get you?<br> - On my arm.<br> - Here?<br> - ls it broken?<br> - Leave it alone!<br> lt's all right.<br> He just nicked me.<br> Will you please stop?<br> All right. What?<br> lt's him.<br> - lt's him.<br> - No.<br> lt's him, by God.<br> l tell you, it's him.<br> lt is him.<br> Yeah. All right. lt's him.<br> All right. Give him a leg up there.<br> Remember, this is our big chance.<br> lt's up to you.<br> Take him out.<br> Come on! Bring him on!<br> Hey! He's out cold.<br> He passed out.<br> Get him out of that mane.<br> Hold him steady.<br> - Got him.<br> - Give me your knife.<br> - All right.<br> - Watch it. Hold him steady.<br> Whoa, sonny.<br> Here.<br> - Where'd you get this animal?<br> - Get him off.<br> Good boy.<br> - Get him outta here.<br> - l got him.<br> Watch yourself.<br> Watch it, sir.<br> Whoa, boy.<br> What happened?<br> Did l fall off?<br> No.<br> No, you hung on like a champ.<br> What happened?<br> Where's The Black?<br> lt's all right.<br> Don't worry about it. lt's fine.<br> He's over in the van with Nappy.<br> He did good, didn't he?<br> He did great.<br> You did great.<br> You all right?<br> - How did you like what you saw?<br> - l wasn't disappointed.<br> Disappointed?<br> You never saw a horse<br> run like that in your life.<br> This could put you back<br> in the action, eh, Dailey?<br> Don't get hard with me.<br> You know l never liked it.<br> l need this race.<br> l need it bad,<br> and you can do it.<br> Will you do it?<br> lf that horse goes like that<br> with a kid...<br> - what will he do with a real rider?<br> - The race.<br> Nice going, kid.<br> You got guts.<br> You heard me say<br> that Cyclone and Sunraider...<br> are the fastest horses<br> in the world today.<br> l'm going to eat those words now<br> because l've seen another horse...<br> that defies the imagination,<br> that runs like a demon possessed...<br> at night, alone,<br> at speeds beyond belief.<br> He's never run a race,<br> and he comes out of nowhere...<br> but he could be the greatest<br> sensation in racing history.<br> So l challenge the owners<br> of both Cyclone...<br> and Sunraider to meet this mystery horse<br> in their upcoming match race.<br> This isn't a joke.<br> This mystery horse is real,<br> and l'll stake my reputation on it.<br> This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville<br> from Belmont.<br> Do you know any<br> real good, famous jockeys?<br> There are a lot of 'em.<br> George Wolf, the lceman.<br> That's just what they call him.<br> Georgie Wolf.<br> They call him in the newspapers<br> the lceman...<br> because he sits chilly<br> on a horse.<br> That means he sits there<br> and he can wait.<br> He knows what to do.<br> He's studying a horse.<br> He's up there ridin',<br> goin' on with him.<br> You know what l mean?<br> He's sittin' up there, goin' on...<br> just studyin' him!<br> Studyin' him.<br> Just studyin' him.<br> When it's time to make his move...<br> he'll say--<br> Here comes the lceman!<br> Mom, do you want me<br> to mow the lawn...<br> or wash the dishes<br> or something?<br> Sure.<br> Why don't you make all the beds<br> and vacuum in here too?<br> - Mom, have you read this here?
