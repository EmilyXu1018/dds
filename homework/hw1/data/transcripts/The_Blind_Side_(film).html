                        There's a moment of orderly silence<br> before a football play begins.<br> Players are in position,<br> linemen are frozen,<br> and anything is possible.<br> Then, like a traffic accident,<br> stuff begins to randomly collide.<br> From the snap of the ball<br> to the snap of the first bone<br> is closer to four seconds than five.<br> One Mississippi.<br> Joe Theismann,<br> the Redskins quarterback<br> takes the snap and hands off<br> to his running back.<br> Two Mississippi.<br> It's a trick play, a flea-flicker,<br> and the running back tosses the ball<br> back to the quarterback.<br> Three Mississippi.<br> Up to now the play's been defined<br> by the what the quarterback sees.<br> It's about to be defined<br> by what he doesn't.<br> Four Mississippi.<br> Lawrence Taylor is the best<br> defensive player in the NFL<br> and has been from the time he stepped<br> onto the field as a rookie.<br> He will also change the game of football<br> as we know it.<br> ...And we'll look at it<br> with the reverse angle one more time.<br> And I suggest if your stomach is weak<br> you just don't watch ...<br> Legendary quarterback Joe Theismann<br> never played another down of football.<br> Now, y'all would guess<br> that more often than not<br> the highest paid player on<br> an NFL team is the quarterback.<br> And you'd be right.<br> What you probably don't know<br> is that more often than not<br> the second highest paid player is,<br> thanks to Lawrence Taylor,<br> a left tackle.<br> Because, as every housewife knows,<br> the first check you write<br> is for the mortgage<br> but the second is for the insurance.<br> And the left tackle's job<br> is to protect the quarterback<br> form what he can't see coming.<br> To protect his blind side.<br> The ideal left tackle is big,<br> but a lot of people are big.<br> He is wide in the butt<br> and massive in the thighs.<br> He has long arms, giant hands<br> and feet as quick as a hiccup.<br> This is a rare and expensive combination<br> the need for which can be traced<br> to that Monday night game<br> and Lawrence Taylor.<br> For on that day he not only<br> altered Joe Theismann's life,<br> but mine as well.<br> Mr. Oher?<br> Mr. Oher?<br> Do you understand..?<br> Do you know why I'm here?<br> To... investigate?<br> Yes. To investigate.<br> Im here to investigate your odd...<br> predicament.<br> Do you find it odd?<br> Your predicament?<br> Michael?...<br> I dunno.<br> Can I... can I leave now?<br> No. You can't.<br> # Strange face, with your eyes #<br> # So pale and sincere #<br> # Underneath, you know well #<br> # You have nothing to fear #<br> # For the dreams that came to you #<br> # when you were young #<br> # Told of a life where #<br> # Spring has crawled #<br> # You would seem so frail #<br> # In the cold of the night #<br> # When the armies of emotion #<br> # Go out to fight #<br> # But while the earth #<br> # sinks to its grave #<br> # You sail to the sky #<br> # On the crest of a wave #<br> They said you were the coach.<br> Burt Cotton.<br> Tony Hamilton, but everybody<br> just calls me big Tony.<br> Hey, Big Mike! Check it out.<br> Not even locked!<br> White people are crazy.<br> I promised my mama Boo, on her deathbed<br> that I'd get my son Steven outta<br> public school and into a church school.<br> I appreciate that, Tony.<br> But I'm not involved with admissions.<br> I just figured maybe I'd come<br> to talk to you,<br> seeing as you might need some players.<br> What kind of sport<br> is he playing?<br> Anything with a ball.<br> Boy's good, too.<br> Classes start in a week. It would<br> have to be for the next semester.<br> I know, what you're thinking, Coach.<br> But, look here, I got money, all right?<br> See I'm a mechanic at Wilson's Auto<br> the other side of town.<br> Look, what if somebody drops out<br> or moves?<br> Could they get in then?<br> "They?"<br> You only mentioned one son.<br> That's right, Steven.<br> But there's another boy.<br> - Another boy?<br> - Yeah.<br> Big Mike.<br> Sleeps on my couch<br> from time to time.<br> It's a bad deal. You know,<br> his mama's on the crack pipe.<br> He ain't got nobody else.<br> He just wanted to come along<br> for the ride.<br> - They're here?<br> - Yeah.<br> The little one, that's Steven<br> and the big one...<br> Big Mike.<br> Swish!<br> Mike!<br> Come on!<br> Mother of God....<br> Steven Hamilton's paperwork<br> looks acceptable to me.<br> And I believe he would do fine.<br> - But this other kid...<br> - Big Mike.<br> Michael Oher gives us<br> no reason to believe that,<br> based on his record,<br> that he would be successful here.<br> How bad could it be?<br> We're not exactly sure how old<br> he is due to his lack of records.<br> He has a measured IQ of 80.<br> Which is 6th percentile.<br> His grade point average begins with zero.<br> Zero-point-six.<br> Everyone passed him along<br> they gave him D's so they could hand<br> their problem off to the next school.<br> He's a brave kid.<br> For wanting to come here.<br> For wanting a quality education.<br> An education denied him by the poor<br> quality of the schools he's attended.<br> I tell you most kids<br> with his background<br> wouldn't come within two hundred miles<br> of this place.<br> Coach Cotton, we understand your interest<br> in this young man's athletic abilities.<br> Now, he wouldn't be able to play sports<br> until he got his grades up anyway.<br> Forget sports!<br> Look at the wall.<br> Christian.<br> We either take that seriously<br> or we paint over it.<br> You don't admit Michael Oher<br> because of sports,<br> you admit him<br> because it's the right thing to do.<br> Class, this is Mike Oher<br> and he's new here<br> so I expect you all<br> to make him feel welcome.<br> Mike, just take any empty seat.<br> This is a quiz based on the information<br> you learned last year<br> in your science curriculum.<br> Don't worry.<br> It's not gonna be graded.<br> I just want to see how much<br> information we need to hit again.<br> Just answer whatever you know.<br> Thank you.<br> - Can I leave now?<br> - Yeah.<br> Take your book.<br> Why should he always stay in our home?<br> - He's gonna eat all our food.<br> - This is not true.<br> I try to be Christian about the son.<br> All right?<br> Let somebody else be<br> Christian about this kid.<br> You want me to throw him out<br> on the street like some dog?<br> Let somebody else take<br> over the responsibility!<br> Should I throw him out<br> on the street?<br> He's here all the time.<br> I just want to be with you!<br> All right. All right. Whatever<br> You win. I'll take care of it.<br> I don't care if Patrick Ramsey<br> approved the chair.<br> He's the NFL quarterback<br> not Martha frickin' Stewart.<br> Because there's a difference between<br> Bunny Williams and a La-Z-boy.<br> No. See, when MTV Cribs<br> comes to his house<br> he's gonna be showing off<br> his home theatre<br> all I'm gonna see is<br> a brown Barcalounger.<br> No. No, listen to me.<br> I'm the designer, my name is on it.<br> Deliver what I ordered!<br> All right? Thank you.<br> - What'd I miss?<br> - Collins has just got a dig.<br> It's a girl's volleyball, Mom.<br> You didn't miss anything.<br> - Come on Collins! Move your feet! Come on!<br> - Good job, Collins!<br> Go!<br> Collins, we're gonna wait<br> for you outside.<br> But don't double condition in<br> the shower, you have homework!<br> I'm going over to Cannon's to study.<br> SJ! SJ, do not go to the<br> girl's locker room again.<br> Come here!<br> SJ, come here!<br> Well, the big kid's been here<br> for a month<br> he's still not cutting in my class.<br> Why does Admissions do this?<br> I mean, it's not fair to us or the boy.<br> Just setting him up to fail.<br> I don't think, he has any idea<br> what I'm teaching.<br> And how would you know if he did?<br> He won't even talk.<br> - He writes.<br> - His name. Barely.<br> He thew this in the trash can.<br> "I look and I see white everywhere:<br> white walls, white floors,<br> and a lot of white people.<br> The teachers do not know I have no idea<br> of anything they are talking about.<br> I do not want to listen to anyone,<br> especially the teachers.<br> They are giving homework<br> and expecting me<br> to do the problems on my own.<br> I have never done homework<br> in my life.<br> I go to the bathroom,<br> look in the mirror and say,<br> "This is not Michael Oher."<br> He entitled it "White Walls."<br> How's the spelling?<br> Hi.<br> Smile at 'em.<br> It lets them know<br> you're their friend.<br> You're Big Mike, right?<br> I'm Sean.<br> But everyone calls me SJ.<br> It's for Sean junior,<br> my Father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy.<br> He was a basketball star<br> at Ole Miss, point guard,<br> now he owns like<br> a million Taco Bells.<br> Manana.<br> - Who is that SJ?<br> - Big Mike.<br> Get you feet off my dash.<br> Thank you. Put on your seatbelt!<br> Big Mike?<br> Mike, I got a call from someone<br> at the police department.<br> Do you remember the story in the papers<br> awhile back about...<br> a man who fell off an overpass?<br> No one knew who he was<br> and or if he jumped, or...<br> Umm... anyway he...<br> he passed away.<br> Mike, that man was your father.<br> They've been looking for somebody to<br> notify and they...<br> They found your name on our registry.<br> I'm really sorry, son.<br> Were you close to him?<br> When's the last time you saw him?<br> I dunno.<br> - He knows it!<br> - Who knows it and what does he know?<br> The material. Michael Oher.<br> I gave him this test verbally.<br> Is that even allowed?<br> A "C."<br> On how big a curve?<br> He's been listening all along.<br> It's amazing what he's absorbed.<br> And trust me. He's listening to you, too.<br> Now, his reading level is low<br> and he's got no idea how to learn<br> in the classroom.<br> I'm not saying he's going to pass<br> but Big Mike is not stupid.<br> - Hey.<br> - What, Mom?<br> - Good job.<br> - Yes?<br> Good job.<br> Hey, I got a question for you.<br> Go.<br> There was a little girl<br> about two rows back.<br> What was her name?<br> - Oh, that was Kinsey.<br> - Kinsey. Yeah.<br> I saw your little indian feathers<br> get all ruffled up.<br> Yeah. She's nice.<br> SJ, don't let this go to your head<br> but I thought you were<br> very convincing in the role of...<br> - Indian Number Three.<br> - Yes.<br> I tried out for the Chief<br> but they gave it to Andy Sung.<br> I can't be sure, but I think there was<br> some multicultural bias thing working.<br> Or maybe they just thought<br> he'd make a better chief.<br> Dad, he's like Chinese.<br> Yeah and you're Irish.<br> And if you weren't the Chief,<br> how did you get that headdress?<br> Dad, I'm gonna need a few more<br> of those free Quesadilla tickets.<br> And where does the acorn fall?<br> Hey, don't laugh too hard.<br> The Quesadilla saved our ass.<br> Don't use the a-word.<br> What is he wearin'?<br> It's freezing.<br> What is his name again?<br> Big Mike.<br> Where is he going?<br> Hey, Big Mike!<br> Where you headin'?<br> Gym....<br> Go ahead.<br> Turn around.<br> Big Mike...<br> Stop the car.<br> Big Mike.<br> Hey, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy.<br> My kids go to Wingate.<br> You said you're going to the gym?<br> The school gym's closed.<br> Why were you going to the gym?<br> Big Mike?!<br> Why were you going to the gym?<br> Because... it's warm.<br> Do you have any place to stay tonight?<br> Don't you dare lie to me.<br> I've seen that look many times.<br> She's about to get her way.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> SJ, make room.<br> Get inside.<br> Come on.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - Home.<br> Oh no! That's my favourite part.<br> So cute.<br> How'd the dork do<br> in the school play?<br> Umm... Okay.<br> Collins, you know Big Mike<br> from school?<br> I'd give you the guest bedroom<br> but it's full of sample boxes.<br> And the sectional in the family room<br> slides apart when you sleep on it.<br> At least that's what Sean says.<br> Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the coach?<br> Only when he's bad. All right.<br> The powder room's right there and<br> we will be upstairs if you need us.<br> All right? Right.<br> Sleep tight, honey.<br> - Was this a bad idea?<br> - What?<br> Don't lie there and pretend like you're<br> not thinking the same thing as me.<br> Fine, tell me what you're thinking<br> so I know what's supposed to be<br> on my mind.<br> How well do you know Big Mike?<br> In case you haven't noticed<br> he doesn't have much to say.<br> What's the big deal?<br> It's just for one night, right?<br> It is just one night, right?<br> Leigh Anne?<br> You don't think he'll steal anything,<br> do you?<br> I guess we'll know in the morning.<br> Well if you hear a scream<br> call the insurence adjustor.<br> Mike?<br> Big Mike?!<br> Mike?<br> Big Mike!<br> You gonna make me<br> walk all the way?<br> All right then.<br> Where are you going?<br> I dunno.<br> Well, are you spending Thanksgiving<br> with your family?<br> TV commentary<br> TV commentary<br> - Come and get it, childs!<br> - Yeah, baby!<br> Let's eat<br> Come on!<br> We have a rebel turkey.<br> Everyone thank your mother for driving<br> to the store and getting this.<br> - Thank you, mama.<br> - Thank you, mama.<br> Food and football.<br> Eat all you want.<br> Come on.<br> Hustle, hustle!<br> We got to get back to the game.<br> Oh yeah!<br> - Don't take my spot.<br> - You rushin' us, dad.?<br> - SJ, slow down.<br> - Come on.<br> - No.<br> - That's just fantastic.<br> Oh, y'all forgot the potato salad!<br> - How's Ole Miss doing?<br> - kick-in butt.<br> Sean, salad.<br> - All right, Mom.<br> - Oh, good.

I got a just<br> what you're looking for.<br> Well, one thing I know<br> about shopping is<br> that if you don't absolutely love it<br> in the store, you won't wear it.<br> The store is where you like it best.<br> So before you choose something<br> think of yourself wearing it<br> and say to yourself:<br> Is this me?<br> Hmm.<br> What about this one?<br> This is not atrocious.<br> All right, well, you go look over there<br> and I'll go look over here.<br> Who would make this many<br> clothes out of plastic?<br> Good Lord...<br> What is this made of?<br> That's the one?<br> That's the one you like?<br> All right then.<br> Have a great day.<br> Learn something!<br> Don't get your panties in a wad.<br> The best part about Paris was the food.<br> They use sauce like we use gravy.<br> I had to join a gym the day I got back.<br> Any of y'all spent much time<br> on the other side of town?<br> - Where exactly are you talking about?<br> - Alabama Street... Hurt Village.<br> Hurt Village - that sounds like a threat.<br> You're not far off.<br> - I think it might "hurt" me to go there.<br> - It'd hurt your reputation to go there.<br> Well actually I'm from there<br> but didn't mind hard work<br> and look where I am now.<br> Eating an eighteen dollar salad.<br> And it's a little soggy to be honest.<br> Leigh Anne? What is this sudden interest<br> in the projects?<br> Is this another one<br> of your charities?<br> Wait. A project for the projects.<br> Oh, that's catchy.<br> Money would raise itself.<br> Okay. Count me in, Leigh Anne.<br> Break out your checkbooks.<br> SJ, you have two more minutes<br> on that playbox thing, all right?<br> Oh, Mom!<br> Michael, do you want to stay here?<br> I mean ... if you want to stay here...<br> for awhile longer...<br> I can find some time to figure out<br> a bedroom for you.<br> Because look at this, you've practically<br> ruined a ten thousand dollar couch.<br> You want to stay here, Michael?<br> I don't want to go anyplace else.<br> Well all right then.<br> - SJ, you'd better be off that playbox.<br> - That wasn't two minutes.<br> Good night Mrs. Tuohy.<br> I see on the admission that<br> we're Michael's contact<br> for medical emergencies?<br> Sean wrote that in last week.<br> We needed contact number and the ones<br> listed weren't in service.<br> Sean loves that man.<br> What's this?<br> The state makes schools measure<br> for career aptitude in the eighth grade.<br> and this just came with his file.<br> What does it say<br> about Michael?<br> Spatial relations - third percentile.<br> Ability to learn - fifth percentile.<br> It's funny though. He tested in<br> the 98th percentile in one category.<br> - Which one?<br> - "Protective instincts."<br> So over here we have a desk.<br> Chest o'drawers.<br> Over here a night stand, a light, alarm.<br> Sean says all the pro athletes use futons<br> if they can't find a bed big enough.<br> So I got you one of those<br> 'course the frame was heinous.<br> Not about to let that in my house.<br> But I got you someyhing nicer.<br> - It's mine?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What?<br> Never had one before.<br> What? A room to yourself?<br> A bed.<br> Well, you have one now.<br> Okay. Define osmosis.<br> I think I know what.<br> It's when water passes<br> through a barrier.<br> That's basically right.<br> Michael we'll get it.<br> Name the combatants in the battle<br> of Waterloo.<br> I know that one. Umm...<br> The little guy, Napoleon...<br> He was on one side and...<br> - ...and a duke was on the other.<br> - Duke of Wellington.<br> Yeah.

We've got like hundreds.<br> Eighty-five.<br> Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't<br> have to go to work?<br> Ho! Ho! Hey! I'm working<br> even when I'm not working.<br> What?<br> And you eat at all those places for free?<br> All you want. It's awesome.<br> What do y'all do with the leftover food?<br> From the restaurant?<br> Well, we have to throw some of it out.<br> What's already been cooked.<br> - That's too bed.<br> - Yeah. I'd rather sell it.<br> Seems like you could give it away<br> or something?<br> - You should check into that, Daddy.<br> - All right, I will, SJ.<br> How come we're not eatin' at one<br> of your restaurants tonight?<br> Because tonight is a special occasion.<br> What?<br> I talked to Coach Cotton and he said that<br> Michael's grades have improved enough<br> that he can go out for spring football<br> in March.<br> Isn't that great?<br> Oh, man!<br> You are gonna crush some people!<br> - Hey, guys. How we doin'?<br> - Great.

And he works there?<br> Yeah.<br> How do you know him?<br> He's my brother.<br> Well, we'd really like<br> to meet him someday.<br> Would that be okay with you?<br> I don't know where he stays.<br> When was the last time you saw him?<br> When I was little maybe.<br> "Once upon a time in Spain, there was a<br> little bull and his name was Ferdinand.<br> All the other little bulls he lived with<br> would run and jump<br> and butt their heads together,<br> but not Ferdinand.<br> He liked to sit just quietly<br> and smell the flowers.<br> He had a favorite spot out in the pasture<br> under a cork tree.<br> It was his favorite tree<br> and he would sit in its shade all day<br> and smell the flowers."<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> What?<br> Why are you smiling?<br> I don't know. I'm just happy.<br> Real happy.<br> Does this happiness have anything<br> to do with Michael?<br> No.<br> It has everything to do with Michael.<br> Happy's good.<br> You know what I think we should do?<br> We should start a charity<br> for kids like Michael.<br> Okay.<br> - Maybe fund a program at Wingate.<br> - Sure.<br> Lord knows that school<br> could use a little color.<br> Michael's like a fly in milk<br> in that place.<br> Are you listening to me?<br> I try to concentrate on one...<br> thing... at a time.<br> You knew I was a multi-tasker<br> when you married me, right?<br> - I sure did.<br> - All right.

With gusto.<br> She can't stand Tennessee.<br> Collie-bell, I thought you were<br> going over to your boyfriend's?<br> I thought I'd hang around here today.<br> I like that.<br> Hey, baby. There's a coupla messages<br> on the machine but I didn't check 'em.<br> All right.<br> Hey, Sean, hey, Leigh Anne,<br> It's cousin Bobby. Happy New Years!<br> Listen, I've had about five cold ones...<br> - Of course you heve - So I'm...<br> I'm just gonna go ahead and ask...<br> Ya'll know there's a colored boy<br> in your Christmas Card?<br> What?<br> You just looked teeny-tiny next to him.<br> Right? Like Jessica Lange and King Kong.<br> Hey, does Michael get the family discount<br> at Taco Bell?<br> Because if he does Sean's gonna lose<br> a few stores.<br> He's a great kid.<br> Well, I say make it official<br> and just adopt him.<br> He's gonna be eighteen<br> in a few months.<br> Doesn't really make much sense<br> to legally adopt.<br> Leigh Anne, is this some<br> sort of white guilt thing?<br> What will your daddy say?<br> Umm... before or after he turns over<br> in his grave?<br> Daddy's been gone five years Elaine,<br> make matters worse you were<br> at the funeral.<br> Remember? You were Chanel<br> and that awful black hat.<br> Look, here's the deal.<br> I don't need y'all to approve<br> my choices, all right?<br> But I do ask that you respect them.<br> You've no idea what this boy's<br> been through.<br> And If this is going to be<br> some running diatribe<br> I can find an overpriced salad<br> a lot closer to home.<br> Leigh Anne, I'm so sorry.<br> We didn't intend to---<br> No. We didn't really.<br> I think, what you're doing is so great.<br> To open up your home... to him.<br> Honey, you're changing that boy's life.<br> No.<br> He's changing mine.<br> That's awesome for you,<br> but what about Collins?<br> What about Collins?<br> Aren't you worried, I mean,<br> even just a little?<br> He's a boy, a large, black boy,<br> sleeping under the same roof.<br> Shame on you.<br> I've got this.<br> Be honest with me, okay?<br> Does Michael being here make<br> you uncomfortable?<br> They're stupid kids,<br> who cares what they say.<br> What kids?<br> At school.<br> They're juvenile.<br> And what do they juvenile kids say?<br> It's really not worth repeating.<br> And don't worry about SJ;<br> he likes all the attention.<br> He introduces Michael<br> as his big brother.<br> - What about you?<br> - It's fine.<br> I mean, you can't just throw him<br> out on the street.<br> I can make other arrangements.<br> - Hi, Mike.<br> - Hi.<br> - Need a push?<br> -Yeah.<br> Higher, Mike! Higher!<br> Higher!<br> Higher!<br> Don't look down.<br> Don't look down!<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Collins?<br> Quit looking at me like that.<br> I mean, we study together at home.<br> You know how much those things weigh?<br> This kid's gonna make us all famous.<br> Easy, Burt, man.<br> It's only the spring<br> he hasn't even been through<br> his first practice yet.<br> No. He's a player.<br> Ready.<br> Get down, son.<br> Get down in your stance.<br> In your stance!<br> Go!<br> Mike! Son!<br> You fought off the block and then<br> you wanna shuck - shuck the blocker.<br> Right? Shuck him!<br> All right? Let's go!<br> Papa?<br> How's he doing?<br> Doesn't quite get<br> the hang of it yet.<br> Hey, Mike. Son...<br> Shuck the blocker. Don't hold him!<br> No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No.<br> Balloons! There are balloons!<br> Guys, quit looking at the balloons.<br> Everybody.<br> Most kids from bad situations<br> can't wait to be violent<br> and that comes out on the field.<br> This kid, he acts like he doesn't want<br> to hit anyone.<br> He's Ferdinand the Bull.<br> - What?<br> - Nothing.<br> I thought sure he was gonna be a player.<br> I can't believe I used up my chits<br> to get him in school.<br> I thought you said it was<br> your Christian duty?<br> Look, Burt. He's never even played before.<br> And he won't this fall if he doesn't<br> improve a lot before then.<br> Who died and made him Bear Bryant?<br> Unbelievable!<br> Oh, God bless me.<br> This is your summer workout sheet.<br> Now, first it says to warm up<br> and get loose.<br> Go ahead, get loose.<br> Are you loose?<br> Okay, next it's five one hundred yard runs<br> to stretch out your legs.<br> Let's go home,<br> play some video games.<br> Look, everybody at Wingate is expecting<br> you to be a star football player.<br> You don't want to let<br> them down, do you?<br> I dunno.<br> What about Dad and Mom?<br> 'Cause you see, in our family<br> everyone's an athlete.<br> Dad was a basketball star,<br> Collins plays volleyball<br> and runs track.<br> And me, as you know, I do it all.<br> And Mom...<br> Mom was a cheerleader,<br> which doesn't exactly count<br> but don't tell her I said that.<br> - Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> Okay.<br> ...fifty, fifty-one,<br> fifty-two, fifty-three...<br> Come on and get it!<br> Go, go, go, go, go!<br> Come on. Five seconds left in the game!<br> Just like!<br> Just like!<br> High knees, high knees, high knees!<br> baby.<br> Run like the wind!<br> Go, Michael, go!<br> ...ninety-eight, nine,<br> one hundred.<br> Move your feet! Move your feet!<br> Come on! Come on! Come on!<br> Go. There you go.<br> Get on the tackle!<br> Come on! Come on! Come on!<br> Come on, Michael!<br> Mrs. Tuohy?<br> I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my<br> shoulder for my mother-in-law.<br> Call me Leigh Anne or Mama<br> or almost anything else.<br> - Can you help me get something?<br> - What?<br> Driver's license.<br> Why do you need a driver's license<br> when you don't even have a car?<br> Michael, why do you want<br> a driver's license?<br> Something to carry.<br> With my name on it.<br> There's no one by the name of<br> Michael Oher in the system.<br> Another last name perhaps?<br> Look, I will sign something<br> that says he lives with us<br> and we'll pay for all the insurence;<br> whatever it takes, okay?<br> What's it gonna take?<br> - You wanna do what?!<br> - You heard me.<br> - Shouldn't we at least talk about this?<br> - What do you think we're doing?<br> And don't act like I'm going<br> behind your back.<br> I know you put us down as Michael's<br> medical contact at school.<br> There's a huge difference between<br> paying for broken arm<br> and being legally responsible<br> for someone.<br> I mean a kid we barely know.<br> That's another thing. We need<br> to find out more about his past.<br> He won't talk about it.<br> He's like an onion,<br> you have to peel him back<br> a layer at a time.<br> Not if you use a knife.<br> What if we took him to a child<br> psychologist or something?<br> - Do you really expect Big Mike---<br> - "Michael"<br> You really expect Michael to lie down<br> on a coach and talk about his childhood<br> like he's Woody Allen or something?<br> I mean, Michael's gift<br> is his ability to forget.<br> He's mad at no one and he really<br> didn't care what happened in the past.<br> You're right.<br> Excuse me?<br> "You're right?"<br> How'd those words taste<br> coming out of your mouth?<br> Like vinegar.<br> At least promise me you'll think about it.<br> All right.<br> "All right" you'll think about it or<br> "all right" we should do it?<br> Is there a difference?<br> Just tell Gerald to hold on to the chiffonier<br> and I will be by there after awhile.<br> You don't...<br> I got to call you back. Bye.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm not cutting, I'm just asking.<br> Let me tell you something, all right?<br> We've been sitting around here<br> for over an hour<br> and when i look around<br> and all I see<br> is people shooting the bull<br> and drinking coffee.<br> Who runs this place?<br> Well, I'd have it in shape in two days,<br> I can tell you that.<br> I'd bet you would.<br> How can I help you?<br> - Oh, he was first.<br> - No, you go ahead.<br> - I think I want to hear this<br> - Me too.<br> I do not appreciate<br> the attitude.<br> Ma'am,<br> now you can tell me what you want<br> or I'll make sure you wait all day.<br> Now how can I help you?<br> I'd like to become<br> a legal guardian.<br> Lord help that child.<br> There's very little on Michael.<br> Most of his files have been lost.<br> - What is in there?<br> - A few case notes.<br> This one describes an incident where<br> officers forcibly removed Michael<br> from Denise Oher's care<br> when Michael was seven.<br> Quite a scene evidently.<br> They had to split up the kids.<br> And it's far from the worst.<br> Where is she? His mother?<br> I dunno, if you find her we got<br> a hep more files we could add to.<br> - How many kids does she have?<br> - At least a dozen, probably.<br> If not more.<br> With her drug arrest record<br> my guess would be<br> she can't even remember.<br> May I see that?<br> So we would need her permission, right?<br> No. Michael is a ward of the state.<br> Just apply and get a judge<br> to sign off on it.<br> So you would just give him away<br> without even telling his mother?<br> Mrs. Oher?<br> Hi.<br> Mrs. Oher?<br> - You from the state?<br> - No.<br> My name is Leigh Anne Tuohy<br> and your son Michael lives with me.<br> And my family.<br> How is my boy? How's big Mike?<br> He's fine. He's doing real well.<br> We might have some wine<br> in the kitchen, if you...<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> That's real kind.<br> When did you last see Michael?<br> I don't know.<br> How many foster kids you got<br> living with you?<br> Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael.<br> We were just helping him out.<br> - State don't pay you nothing?<br> - No.<br> And you feed him?<br> You buy him clothes, too?<br> Well, when we can find them in his size.<br> You a fine Christian lady.<br> Well I try to be.<br> This is all real nice<br> what you're doing,<br> but don't be surprised if one day<br> you wake up and he gone.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - He's a "runner."<br> That's what the state called him<br> after they took him from me.<br> Every foster home they sent him to,<br> he'd slip out the window at night<br> and come looking for me.<br> No matter where I was that boy would<br> come find me, take care of me.<br> I've had some health problems.<br> Mrs. Oher, was Michael born<br> under a different name?<br> Proctor. That was his Daddy's last name.<br> - Where is he?<br> - I ain't seen him since he left.<br> And when was that?<br> Week after was Mike born?<br> Do you happen to have his birth certificate?<br> It's all right. I'll figure it out.<br> Mrs. Oher, you'll always<br> be Michael's Mama.<br> Would you like to see him?<br> No. Not this way.<br> It's Williams.<br> His last name is Williams.<br> Couldn't even remember<br> who the boy's father is.<br> The colors are better, the graphic is bright.<br> It's awesome!<br> Michael, we have something<br> we'd like to ask you.<br> What?<br> Leigh Anne and I, we...<br> Well...<br> We'd like to become your legal guardians.<br> What's that mean?<br> What it means is, is that we want to know<br> if you'd like to become<br> a part of this family?<br> I kinda thought I already was.<br> Well all right then.<br> Right here.<br> We got a couple of steps.<br> - Watch your big foot.<br> - One more.<br> One more. There we go.<br> All right. Take off the blindfold.<br> Well, that's the one you wanted,<br> isn't it?<br> Here. Here you go.<br> Go ahead. Take it for a ride. Go on.<br> - Can I go too?<br> - Yeah.<br> Michael? Be careful.<br> Shotgun!<br> - He wanted a truck?!<br> - Michael thinks he's a redneck.<br> Come on, Michael!<br> Okay. See, you're the ketchup, here<br> at left tackle. On the weak side.<br> The first play is simple. "Gap."<br> Now, see, dishes means you're going<br> to block whoever is in front of you,<br> or on your inside shoulder if you're not<br> covered by a defender.<br> Now, I'll be the running back and you<br> show me what you're supposed to do.<br> Ready.... Hike!<br> You block him, you hit him,<br> quarterback will hand it off,<br> he gets the ball and...<br> Open lane to the end zone.<br> All there is to it.<br> What's going on here?!<br> Player Spice just scored.<br> We're going through the playbook.<br> Michael got moved to offense.<br> Yeah. Well, when you're done, please,<br> put the players back in the spice cabinet.<br> - Thank you.<br> - No problem.<br> Oh, actually, Mom, we were<br> kinda waiting for you.<br> You see, the new Madden game came out<br> and me and Michael wanted to go get it.<br> I can't, baby. I've got a meeting<br> in ten minutes<br> But he can drive!<br> He can drive us.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> That's what I'm talking about.<br> - What do you know about this?<br> - I know a lot about this!<br> - All right, show me something.<br> - I'll show you something, all right?<br> I'll start it.

I called the insurence.<br> He's fine. He's fine!<br> I'll talk to you later.<br> I got to go. Bye.<br> SJ's fine.<br> He is. He's actually enjoying all<br> the attention he's getting back there.<br> Hey, Michael. Could happen to anyone,<br> all right? It's not your fault.<br> Honey, look at me.<br> Michael, what happened to your arm?<br> I stopped it.<br> Let's go!<br> Oher!

Left tackle.<br> - Michael! Come on!<br> Oher? Come here, son.<br> If you're going to hold him, hold him here, inside,<br> between the tits. You got it?!<br> Would you look at me, son.<br> If you grab him outside here, like this,<br> with that horse collar thing, you just did,<br> we're going to get flagged and<br> I'm gonna get pissed.

I watched<br> your program you've done really well.<br> I don't think there is any question<br> that you'll be at the next level soon.<br> Oh, well, you know,<br> we do all we can with what we got.<br> Is that Michael?<br> Is that O'Hair?<br> It's Oher.<br> Like a paddle in a boat. Oher.<br> You think we might see some drills?<br> Perhaps... I think all the Coaches<br> would appreciate it.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Oh, yes, sir. You bet.<br> Listen up, fellas! New board drill!<br> Big Mike, Jay Collis.<br> Best on best. Right here.<br> Let's go! Come on! come on!<br> On my whistle, men!<br> Wow!<br> Coach, thank you.<br> - Where you off to Coach?<br> - Back to South Carolina.<br> You tell Michael Oher,<br> if he can qualify with the grades...<br> Clemson wants him.<br> Yeah. Good luck with that, Brad!<br> Coach, you've done a great job<br> with this young man.<br> Oh, well he was little raw<br> when we first got him<br> but we, you know,<br> coached him up a little bit.<br> Hello, mom.<br> Did you know that to be eligible<br> for a Division One scholarship<br> Michael's gonna need<br> to make a 2.5 GPA?<br> Really?<br> His ACT is low and I don't see him doing<br> any better if he retakes it right there.<br> - What's his GPA now?<br> - 1.76.<br> Oh, that's not too bad, when you<br> consider where he started.<br> He's gonna have to make all A's this year.<br> I'm serious.<br> And that might not even be enough.<br> So he goes to a junior college?<br> Most inner city kids that go to JC<br> drop out in the first year.<br> His shot at the pros would go<br> out the window.<br> Pros? Are we even sure<br> he's gonna get college offers?<br> Michael, Nick Saban from LSU<br> I'm looking forward to you coming<br> down and visit us sometime.<br> Grady. I'm Lou Holtz from<br> South Carolina. I'm call...<br> We are very interested in having Michael<br> over to Knoxville for a visit.<br> - Phil Fulmer, from Tennessee.<br> - Uh huh. There's twenty more of them on there.<br> And these things right here.<br> Fifty of 'em.<br> Any of those from Ole Miss?<br> No, they're not gonna start recruiting<br> until they hire a another coach.<br> Does make any difference<br> unless Michael makes his grades.<br> So, what are we going to do?<br> I understand you applied for<br> a teaching position at Wingate?<br> I wasn't religious enough for 'em.<br> I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy, but<br> I have certain, shall we say... doubts.<br> Oh, I appreciate your honesty, Miss Sue.<br> - What's the situation with Michael?<br> - He needs to do better in school.<br> Obviously. Why the big push?<br> Well, he's in line for<br> football scholarship<br> if he gets his grades up.<br> - Is he considering Ole Miss?<br> - He'd better be.<br> - I'd love to work with him.<br> - Well, when would you like to start?<br> Ms. Tuohy... Umm... There's something<br> you should know about me.<br> I don't usually tell many people, but<br> I feel it's something you should be aware of<br> before you hire me.<br> What is it?<br> I 'm a Democrat.<br> Okay.<br> - I don't understand it.<br> - Yet.<br> You don't understand it yet.<br> - How big is your head, Michael?<br> - Big.<br> And what's in there?<br> - A brain.<br> - A brain.<br> It's full of knowledge -<br> like a file cabinet with maps;<br> and shortcuts for figuring things out.<br> You'll get there, Michael Oher<br> because I'm here to help you use those maps<br> and reach your destination.<br> Like Sacagawea helped<br> Lewis and Clark.<br> Sacagawea?<br> We'll get to that.<br> And the history books have it wrong,<br> All you need to know<br> is I'll get you there.<br> Do you believe me?<br> You trust me, Michael?<br> Yes, Miss Sue.<br> Try it again.<br> Now, what's the next one?<br> Read that to me.<br> What does it say?<br> First, we have to find the constant.<br> Now, where is the constant?<br> Good. See?<br> Who'd thought we'd have a black son<br> before we knew a Democrat.<br> - Doorbell!<br> - I got it guys.<br> Coach, how are you? Come in.<br> - Sean Tuohy.<br> - Sean.<br> - Nick Saban. Nice to meet you.<br> - Nice to see you. Pleasure.<br> I appreciate the opportunity<br> to come in your home.<br> - That's my daughter, Collins.<br> - Hi. Pleasure to meet you.<br> - And you must be Leigh Anne.<br> - That would be me, Coach Saban.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - Me too.<br> Please, call me Nick.<br> With an incredible home.<br> The Windsor valances are a nice touch.<br> Oh, thank you. You obviously<br> have excellent taste.<br> Well we appreciate quality.<br> And recognize it when we see it.<br> Michael, why don't you come in here<br> and say hello to Coach Saban.<br> Hello, Michael. Nick Saban.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - And you must be SJ.<br> - That's me.<br> Michael, why don't you and Nick<br> go into the living room and talk?<br> Can SJ come?<br> Absolutely.<br> We'll recruit the both of you.<br> All right.<br> I find him extremely handsome.<br> Yeah, I'm right here, Leigh Anne.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> So Michael, we would love to<br> get you down to LSU for visit.<br> We've got a great thing going there<br> right now,<br> you have an opportunity to be<br> successful as a person, as a student,<br> and an opportunity to be a part of the next<br> national championship team at LSU.<br> So what do you say?<br> Would you like to commit to a visit?<br> - Can I ask a question?<br> - Sure.<br> My brother and I are very close.<br> And so... I'm very afraid that<br> if he goes off to school,<br> I might not get to see him.<br> - So ...<br> - Go on.<br> I guess I was just wondering how much<br> access I'd have to him.<br> Well, SJ, you would have total access<br> to Michael.<br> But better than that, in his first game<br> in Tiger stadium,<br> we would like for you to lead<br> the team out of the tunnel.<br> - What do you think about that?<br> - Sounds good.<br> Come on in!<br> Greetings. I'm Lou Holtz.<br> The University of South Carolina.<br> Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.<br> Come on in. Michael!<br> Hello. I'm Tommy Tuberville.<br> Auburn University.<br> Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.<br> Michael!<br> Howdy, Houston Nutt.<br> University of Arkansas.<br> Leigh Anne Tuohy.<br> Very nice to meet you.<br> - Ole Miss cup, huh?<br> - Michael!<br> Oh, come on. You know this.<br> It's logical.<br> I guarantee you come to the<br> University of South Carolina<br> it will be the smartest decision<br> you've ever made.<br> We want you, we need you,<br> but the other thing is,<br> Mike, you need us.<br> Knoxville is a tremendous place<br> to live and...<br> I know there's lions, there's tigers,<br> there's bears...<br> Hey, there's only one razorback<br> in the world.<br> ...and not only that, you would look great<br> in Gamecock red!<br> What's in if for me?<br> SJ, I'm gonna get you a hawg hat,<br> and the whole family a hawg hat.<br> Are you telling me,<br> that's the best you can do?<br> SJ, you remind me of me as a boy.<br> Coach, help me, help you.<br> I can get you a Gamecock headdress.<br> And with real feathers.<br> What you got for me, Phil?<br> SJ, I've been thinking a lot of<br> about that and one of the things<br> that I think will be special for both<br> of us is we'll walk arm in arm<br> to the center of Neely Stadium<br> at the first ball game,<br> and we will do the coin toss together.<br> How's that sound?<br> Coach Fulmer, a pleasure doing<br> business with you<br> My pleasure, CJ.<br> You betcha, buddy.<br> Congratulations on gettin' hired.<br> Thank you, Ma'am.<br> Ole Miss is my dream job.<br> You're coming a little late to the party<br> and we're diehard Rebels<br> so I'm gonna give you<br> a frickin' road map.<br> - All right?<br> - Got it.<br> LSU is out. Everybody knows<br> Saban's going to the NFL.<br> I don't wanna name names, but on<br> Michael's first two recruiting trips<br> somebody took him to a tittybar.<br> - That's terrible.<br> - Tell me about it.<br> He had nightmares about it for weeks.<br> So when he comes to visit<br> I want you to feed him Italian -<br> he likes Fettucine Alfredo -<br> and I want you to take him to a movie -<br> not Chainsaw Massacre<br> because he'll just cover his eyes -<br> and get him in bed by ten.<br> - You got it?<br> - Yes ma'am.<br> - All right.<br> - What about Tennessee?<br> It breaks my heart but they're still<br> in the hunt.<br> Fulmer made SJ a sweet deal.<br> I heard that kid can really<br> pepper the gumbo.<br> He's his daddy's boy.<br> - You ready?<br> - Let's do it.<br> All right.<br> Mike, do you love barbecue?<br> I tell you what, Mike.<br> You can go to a gas station<br> and get best barbecue,<br> you ever got in your life.<br> It's a wonderful place to live,<br> fried catfish,<br> all the good food<br> that we love to eat<br> and it's not good for us<br> as football players,<br> you're gonna have it there, Mike.<br> I promise.<br> And for you, SJ,<br> this is what I can do.<br> At Ole Miss we have the grove<br> by the stadium.<br> We walk it before every game,<br> in front of thousands of people.<br> It is a sacrad ritual. And I'm in front.<br> Seen it a thousand times.<br> Ever seen it from the front<br> of the line?<br> Next year, you and me;<br> leading the team.<br> Tennessee offered to let me run<br> on the field and flip the coin.<br> I'll throw in a sideline pass.<br> Have you decided yet, Michael?<br> No, Miss Sue.<br> But you like Tennessee?<br> It's a good school.<br> Not at the academic level of Ole Miss,<br> but they have an outstanding<br> science department.<br> You know what they're famous for?<br> They work with the FBI<br> to study the effects of the soil<br> on decomposing body parts.<br> What's that mean?<br> Well when they find a body, the police<br> want to know how long it's been dead.<br> So the fine folks at Tennessee<br> help them out.<br> They have a lots of body parts.<br> Arms and legs and hands -<br> from hospitals and medical schools.<br> And you know where they store 'em?<br> Right underneath the football field.<br> So, while it's fine and dandy,<br> to have 100,000 fans cheering for you,<br> the bodies you should be worried about<br> are the ones right under the turf.<br> Set to poke up through the ground<br> and grab you.<br> But it's your decision where you wanna<br> play ball.<br> Don't let me influence you.<br> All the other teachers are on board,<br> I don't know what your problem is.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I will not give a student a grade<br> he, or she, doesn't deserve.<br> Well, Michael needs a B.<br> What does he have to do to "deserve" that?<br> Right now Michael is doing C minus,<br> D plus work.<br> His best chance at improvement<br> is the written essay<br> at the end of the year.<br> It counts a third of the grade.<br> Well that's it. We're sunk.<br> Why don't you write about<br> "Great Expectations"?<br> You're a lot like Pip.<br> I mean he was poor, he was an orphan<br> and someone kind of found him.<br> You should be able to relate to that.<br> Fine, let's go through the reading list.<br> But you're gonna have to pick one, Michael.<br> "Pygmalion"...<br> "A Tale of Two Cities".....<br> "The Charge of the Light Brigade"...<br> "Half a league, half a league,<br> half a league onward"<br> I love that one.<br> He loves it.<br> Why don't you do this<br> and I'll watch basketball?<br> Okay.<br> "All in the Valley of Death rode<br> the six hundred."<br> They named LSU's stadium Death Valley<br> because of this story.<br> Alfred, Lord Tennyson, was writing<br> about LSU-Ole Miss.<br> - You're kidding?<br> - No. It's a great story.<br> It's a poem.<br> "Forward the Light Brigade!"<br> It's like the offense.<br> "Charge for the guns he said."<br> That's the end zone.<br> "Into the Valley of Death rode<br> the six hundred."<br> "Forward the Light Brigade!<br> Was there a man dismay'd?<br> Not tho' the soldier knew<br> someone had blundered."<br> Someone made a mistake?<br> Yeah, their leader, their coach.<br> But why would they go ahead<br> if they knew he messed up?<br> "Theirs not to make reply,<br> theirs not to reason why,<br> theirs but to do and die:<br> Into the Valley of Death rode<br> the six hundred."<br> They're all gonna die, aren't they?<br> Yeah.<br> That's really, really sad.<br> I think you just found something<br> to write about, Michael.<br> Courage is a hard thing to figure.<br> You can have courage based<br> on a dumb idea or mistake,<br> but you're not supposed<br> to question adults,<br> or your coach<br> or your teacher<br> because they make the rules.<br> Maybe they know best<br> but maybe they don't.<br> It all depends on who you are,<br> where you come from.<br> Didn't at least one of the six hundred<br> guys think about giving up.<br> and joining with the other side?<br> I mean, Valley of Death<br> that's pretty salty stuff.<br> That's why courage is tricky.<br> Should you always do<br> what others tell you to do?<br> Sometimes you might not even know<br> why you're doing something.<br> I mean any fool can have courage.<br> But honor, that's the real reason<br> you either do something or you don't.<br> It's who you are and maybe<br> who you want to be.<br> If you die trying for<br> something important<br> then you have both<br> honor and courage<br> and that's pretty good.<br> I think that's what the writer<br> was saying.<br> That you should hope for courage<br> and try for honor.<br> And maybe even pray that the people<br> telling you what to do have some, too.<br> Kevin Lynn.<br> - Good job.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Matthew Nichols.<br> Michael's final GPA.<br> Got it off Paul's computer.<br> Jamie North.<br> He did it, Sean. He did it.<br> Wait a minute. You broke into<br> the principal's computer?<br> Michael Oher.<br> Where in the world did you find<br> a baby picture of Michael?<br> Scanned it off an Internet ad<br> for a toddler boutique.<br> Congratulations, Mike.<br> Michael, up top!<br> Way to go, bro!<br> All right, that's enough.<br> Young man...<br> I think I need a proper hug.<br> All right. You're gonna be staying<br> in Deaton Hall - where is it?<br> And you're gonna be on the meal plan<br> so you're gonna be eating all the way over<br> here in Johnson Commons. Right there.<br> Johnson Commons. All you can<br> eat self-serve ice cream.<br> As much as you want?<br> Mm huh, that's how Mama put<br> on her freshman ten.<br> Stop it!<br> Hello?<br> This is Mrs. Tuohy.<br> They just want to ask you a couple<br> of questions, Michael.<br> You have nothing to hide.<br> Ms. Tuohy? Mr. Oher?<br> My name is Jocelyn Granger,<br> and I'm the Assistant Director<br> of Enforcement for the NCAA.<br> Please, call me Leigh Anne.<br> So, let's do this. Shall we?<br> Mrs. Tuohy, if you wouldn't mind<br> I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.<br> - And how long is that gonna take?<br> - Awhile.<br> All right. Go.<br> Michael? Michael! I'll be waiting<br> for you in the lobby, All right?<br> I don't know, Sean. I just have<br> a bad feeling about this one.<br> This woman is tough, tough...<br> Hold on.<br> Hey.<br> The client wants what?<br> Were you aware that Coach Cotton<br> was accepting a job at Ole Miss?<br> No.<br> And that this job offer came after<br> you signed with them?<br> Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian<br> went to Ole Miss.<br> He played basketball.<br> And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss as well.<br> She was a cheerleader.<br> Is it safe to say that Ole Miss<br> is their favorite school?<br> Did they like any other Universities?<br> What about, say Tennessee?<br> No. They can't stand Tennessee.<br> - And your tutor...<br> - Miss Sue.<br> Miss Sue.<br> Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.<br> Miss Sue ever tried to persuade you<br> to attend Ole Miss?<br> Did you know that the Tuohys make<br> generous donations to Ole Miss?<br> That even Miss Sue makes donations?<br> That the Tuohys, they have<br> a condo in Oxford<br> so they can attend as many<br> athletic events as possible?<br> That, in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy<br> are by our definition... "boosters."<br> Mr. Oher.<br> Mr. Oher?<br> Do you understand...<br> Do you know, why am I here?<br> To... investigate.<br> Yes. To investigate.<br> I'm here to investigate your odd...<br> predicament.<br> Do you find it odd?<br> Your predicament?<br> Michael?...<br> I dunno.<br> Can I... can I leave now?<br> No. You can't.<br> - What do you want, ma'am?<br> - I want the facts!<br> - I need the truth.<br> - I didn't lie!<br> - And I want to know what you think<br> about all this. - THINK ABOUT WHAT?!<br> The NCAA fears that with your recruitment<br> a door might be opened -<br> that boosters from lots<br> of schools in the south<br> will become legal guardians of<br> young athletes without means<br> and funnel them to their Alma Maters.<br> I'm not saying I believe it<br> and I'm not saying I don't,<br> but there're many people<br> involved in this case<br> who would argue that Tuohys<br> they took you in,<br> - they clothed you, they fed you,<br> - No.<br> - they paid for your private education,<br> - No.<br> - they bought you a car,<br> - No!<br> - and paid for your tutor,<br> - No.<br> all as part of a plan to insure<br> that you play football<br> for the University of Mississippi.<br> Michael! We're not finished.<br> It's not available. Just like I told you<br> three months ago.<br> So why don't we go with the ....<br> The low nap, it's a beautiful---<br> Oh, I'll call you back. Bye.<br> Michael. So what happened?<br> - Why'd you do it?<br> - What?<br> All along you wanted me<br> to go to Ole Miss.<br> Of course, I did.<br> We love Ole Miss!<br> Why did you do this for me?<br> - What?<br> - Everything!<br> Was it for you or was it for me?<br> Was it so I would go to school<br> where you wanted?!<br> Was it so I would do what you wanted?!<br> - Michael, no...<br> - That's what she thinks.<br> Is she right?<br> Michael, honey, I need for you<br> to just listen to me, all right?<br> Don't you dare to lie to me.<br> I'm not stupid!<br> Michael?!<br> Michael, of course,<br> you're not stupid.<br> Michael?!<br> Come on.<br> I should have followed him.<br> You had no way of knowing<br> he'd disappear.<br> Was he right?<br> What he said about us?<br> Leigh Anne, be reasonable.<br> We gave clothes to a boy<br> who had one pair of shorts.<br> We gave him a bed.<br> To hell with the NCAA,<br> I would do it again tomorrow.<br> What about all the rest of it -<br> all the stuff we did to make sure<br> that he got a scholarship?<br> A scholarship to Ole Miss.<br> He could go whenever he wanted,<br> he knew that.<br> Oh, did he?<br> Did you ask him?<br> 'Cause I sure as hell know I never did.<br> Hey.<br> Come here.<br> Am I a good person?<br> Not a joke. Not rhetorical.<br> You are the best person I know.<br> Everything you do, you do for others.<br> And why is that?<br> I have not a clue.<br> But you obviously get some<br> sort of sick satisfaction out of it.<br> - Sean...<br> - Yeah?<br> What if he never comes back?<br> Oh, shit!<br> Big Mike?<br> Hey, get your ass on in here, man.<br> I'm looking for my mama.<br> Your Mama?<br> Yeah, I seen Dee Dee around.<br> As a matter of fact...<br> Oh, yeah. She usually stop by for a taste<br> around this time.<br> But I tell you what.<br> Why don't you just come on inside<br> I'll get you a forty and we're<br> gonna chop it up like real fo,<br> just 'til she get here.<br> Come on, man.<br> Nobody gonna bite you, man.<br> Hey!
