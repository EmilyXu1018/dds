                        Hey, kid!<br> Hey, Ismael! Catch!<br> Such a pleasure to see you,<br> Herr Lieberman.<br> The pleasure is all mine,<br> Herr Strasser, I assure you.<br> I hate to bother such a famous<br> Nazi-hunter like yourself...<br> ...with such trifles as the rent,<br> but it is the third of the month!<br> Quite so. You will have a cheque<br> in, er... several days.<br> By all means take your time,<br> Herr Lieberman.<br> Feel free to ignore your responsibilities<br> while my property is being ruined!<br> We have floods all over the building<br> because of you!<br> You overload the floor,...<br> ...putting a strain on the pipes upstairs!<br> And then they break!<br> The pipes upstairs break,<br> and I'm to blame?<br> Everything is connected.<br> The whole building will soon collapse...<br> ...because of you.<br> Ezra!<br> - You have a call from Paraguay!<br> - Paraguay?<br> This is an apartment house,<br> not an office!<br> You have no right to bring<br> these heavy cabinets in here.<br> All right, all right!<br> So next time rent to a feather merchant!<br> Hello?<br> Mr Lieberman?<br> - Out! You understand?<br> - Speak a little louder! I can't hear you!<br> Barry Kohler?<br> No, I don't think I know you.<br> I sent you a package with photos.<br> You didn't?<br> You sound like an American.<br> What are you doing in Paraguay?<br> I've been monitoring the activities<br> of a group of Nazis.<br> And I've identified several of them<br> as war criminals.<br> From your books and articles.<br> and you call it junk!<br> Yes! Junk, junk, junk!<br> Herr Strasser,<br> we are wasting valuable time.<br> Huge chunks of plaster<br> are coming down from your ceiling.<br> Look how I step on the ground. Soon<br> I will be through into your apartment.<br> Right into the lap of your beloved wife,<br> God forbid!<br> Come.<br> - Don't push me!<br> - Leave my brother and me alone! Get out!<br> Come,...<br> ...Herr Strasser.<br> Esther, the man's an idiot.<br> No, I'm an idiot,<br> for letting him make me angry.<br> Go on, take your phone call.<br> The young man who has just discovered<br> there are Nazis in South America.<br> So, Mr Kohler, forgive the interruption.<br> Now, er...<br> I work alone, like you, Mr Lieberman.<br> Which is why I'm calling you.<br> I'm onto something.<br> Mr Kohler, it may be a blinding revelation<br> to you that there are Nazis in Paraguay,...<br> ...but I assure you, it is no news to me.<br> And if you stay there much longer,<br> there will still be Nazis in Paraguay,...<br> ...but there will be one less Jewish boy<br> in the world.<br> Something's going on! They seemed to be<br> gathered for some kind of operation.<br> A bunch of them have been moving<br> in and out of Ralph Gunther's estate.<br> I want to know what to do next.<br> Get on a plane and go home.<br> Better still, go to the American Embassy.<br> Run to the American Embassy,<br> and tell them to put you on a plane.<br> Thank you for your advice.<br> What did he want?<br> I don't know... Advice... Instruction...<br> A boy like that,<br> lucky to survive one day in Paraguay.<br> He's been there... some weeks.<br> I told him to go home and he hung up.<br> What did he want? Applause?<br> One, two, three,...<br> ...four.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> One, two,...<br> One, two...!<br> Goddamn! It works!<br> Come on, damn you! Tune in!<br> Gentlemen, he's coming.<br> So, Gunther... this is the moment.<br> Gentlemen, gentlemen,...<br> ...be at your ease, I beg of you.<br> - Gunther, would you do the honours?<br> - Certainly, Dr Mengele.<br> Mengele!<br> Captain Gerhardt Mundt.<br> I have heard nothing but the highest<br> praise for you, Captain Mundt.<br> Thank you, Herr Doktor.<br> - Major Ludwig Trausteiner.<br> - Thank you for coming, Major.<br> - Er... Captain...<br> - It's all right, Gunther.<br> Captain Farnbach and I are old comrades.<br> Are we not, Captain?<br> It's extremely flattering<br> to be remembered, sir.<br> Oh, I am not so senile or so ungrateful<br> that I cannot remember a loyal officer...<br> ...from the early days of the struggle.<br> And now for the youth.<br> This is Friedrich Hessen,<br> son of Wilhelm Hessen.<br> Welcome, young man.<br> Wolfgang Kleist.<br> - I am pleased you are with us.<br> - Thank you, Herr Doktor.<br> - And Otto Schwimmer.<br> - A great pleasure, Herr Schwimmer.<br> And now to business.<br> Sit down, gentlemen, please.<br> The task before you is<br> the most important operation that...<br> ...the Comrades Organisation<br> has ever undertaken.<br> It is the vital link in a programme...<br> ...to which I and your leaders have<br> devoted many years of enormous effort.<br> Your success on this project...<br> ...carries with it the hope<br> and destiny of the Aryan race.<br> And that is not an exaggeration,<br> but the literal truth.<br> It is a holy mission, gentlemen.<br> You should consider yourselves<br> highly honoured...<br> ...to have been chosen to perform it.<br> Now for the details.<br> In the next two and a half years,<br> Sixteen of these men<br> are in West Germany.<br> Fourteen in Sweden.<br> Thirteen in England.<br> Twelve in the United States.<br> Ten in Norway, nine in Austria.<br> Eight in Holland<br> and six each in Denmark and Canada.<br> A total of 94... assassinations.<br> All of these men...<br> ...will be 65 years old when their dates<br> come around. Obviously,...<br> ...a few of them will already<br> have died of natural causes.<br> Yes, Farnbach?<br> Who are these men? Jews?<br> Not one. They are all family men.<br> Civil servants, school principals,<br> men of minor authority.<br> Are we permitted to hire accomplices?<br> I would not advise it.<br> Bear it in mind<br> that these are 65-year-old men.<br> Their eyesight is failing, they have<br> slow reflexes, diminished strength.<br> I've been through Sweden quite a bit...<br> ...but I've never heard<br> of this place... Rasbo?<br> It is a village,...<br> ...about 15 km from Uppsala.<br> That is Bertil Hedin,<br> the postmaster there, ja?<br> And by killing this old mailman I will be<br> fulfilling the destiny of the Aryan race?<br> You wish to be relieved of<br> this assignment, Captain Mundt?<br> No, sir.<br> Then do not question your orders.<br> Simply obey them.<br> Yes, Herr Doktor.<br> I apologise.<br> Further questions?<br> The men's families<br> are not to be involved.<br> And in the case of, say, younger wives...<br> ...who might be open to<br> romantic overtures...<br> ...as accomplices,...<br> ...I repeat,<br> the families are not to be involved.<br> You will live in a manner befitting<br> salesmen for large German firms.<br> And you will have enough money<br> for any equipment you might need.<br> It is vital that you check in<br> with headquarters on the first, er...<br> Find it!<br> Find it!<br> Sir!<br> All right, Lieberman! Listen to this!<br> ...by killing this old mailman I will be<br> fulfilling the destiny of the Aryan race?<br> Operator, any word on my call yet?<br> Hello?<br> Kohler?<br> I thought I told you to leave!<br> Well, I didn't, Mr Lieberman.<br> But I think you're gonna be glad I didn't.<br> Doktor Josef Mengele was here tonight.<br> You call me at 3 o'clock in the morning...<br> ...to tell me Doktor Josef Mengele<br> is in Paraguay? I know that, Mr Kohler!<br> So does my sister,<br> so does my landlord, and my tailor!<br> And now you know it, too!<br> My congratulations!<br> He came to a meeting at Gunther's house<br> tonight, and the others were there, too.<br> Mengele's sending them out to kill 94<br> What are you talking about?<br> Two and a half years?<br> I can hear you, Mr Kohler.<br> I just can't follow what you're saying.<br> Goddamn it, you don't have to believe me!<br> I've got it all on tape!<br> All over. Europe, Canada,<br> the United States.<br> Mostly civil servants.<br> Okay. I'm running it down now.<br> It'll only take a second.<br> Take your time.<br> Old men don't go back to sleep<br> once they have been awakened.<br> Welcome, young man.<br> The stuff on now, it's just a lot of<br> introducing and glad-handing around.<br> Mengele's acting<br> like chairman of the board.<br> Will you stop asking questions<br> and just listen, Mr Lieberman?<br> Sit down, gentlemen, please.<br> Okay, here it comes.<br> The task before you is the most...<br> ...Organisation has ever undertaken.<br> Kohler?<br> Are you there, Kohler? Kohler!<br> Your success on this proj...<br> Kohler?<br> Clean the room.<br> Dispose of the body.<br> I do not want a trace of<br> this vermin to remain.<br> Everything is all right.<br> You will take care of the police.<br> - Who was the boy calling?<br> - It does not matter.<br> - Perhaps you should wait.<br> - We wait for nothing.<br> The Fourth Reich is coming, Gunther.<br> Our men will leave tomorrow as planned.<br> Kill him.<br> Is there no way<br> of checking this further?<br> All right, thank you.<br> The Vienna telephone exchange<br> says there was a call from Paraguay.<br> The Paraguayans say that<br> no such call took place.<br> I have finally found a couple<br> of things from that boy.<br> Mundt!<br> Captain in a Death-Head Regiment.<br> Farnbach, a Gestapo agent.<br> Trausteiner!<br> Assistant Commandant at Dachau!<br> Cheap bureaucrats and murderers!<br> And these,...<br> ...who knows?<br> Ezra! You know you shouldn't.<br> Esther, after all I've been through,<br> one puff won't hurt me.<br> These...<br> Oh!<br> Colonel Eduard Seibert.<br> He's Adjutant to Rausch,<br> the head of the Comrades Organisation.<br> He was in command of the extermination<br> unit on the Eastern Front.<br> He's a real aristocrat.<br> What's he doing<br> in such undistinguished company?<br> - Then it wasn't a hoax after all?<br> - No!<br> Esther,...<br> ...on the telephone,<br> after that boy was cut off,...<br> ...I felt something.<br> Something in the silence.<br> Something alive...<br> ...and...<br> ...hateful.<br> Maybe I'm getting senile, hm?<br> You haven't got the time.<br> ...ordinary men...<br> Beynon!<br> Oh, Christ!<br> Mr Beynon, so nice to see you again.<br> - How are you getting along?<br> - Can't complain. Who'd listen?<br> May I take up a moment of your time?<br> I'm so sorry, I'm late for lunch.<br> Always such a prodigious appetite!<br> What?<br> Eight times last week I called you,<br> and each time you were at lunch.<br> Maybe you have a tapeworm?<br> Now, Sidney, please...<br> Just a few moments of your time.<br> Oh, very well. Come on.<br> You carry this whole damn<br> concentration-camp thing...<br> ...pinned to your coattails.<br> Why do you keep knocking yourself out?<br> Nothing ever pays off.<br> Frieda Maloney is in jail.<br> Frieda Maloney!<br> She was only a guard in a camp.<br> Who strangled young girls with<br> their own hair. Bayoneted infants.<br> Maybe she was a despicable criminal,<br> but she just isn't news 30 years later.<br> Sidney, there is a plot by the Comrades<br> Organisation, which is the illegal army...<br> Yes, I know what it is.<br> It plots to kill 94 men<br> in the next two and a half years.<br> Jews, I suppose?<br> I want your European,<br> Canadian and American bureaux...<br> ...to send you clippings of all<br> ...accidentally.<br> You pass them to me<br> and I'll do the rest.<br> And whose plot is this?<br> Josef Mengele.<br> He's the red herring in this little barrel?<br> What a title for the chief doctor of<br> Auschwitz, who killed 2 million people!<br> Experimented on children,<br> Jewish and non-Jewish,...<br> ...using twins, mostly.<br> Injecting blue dyes into their eyes<br> to make them acceptable Aryans.<br> Ezra!<br> Amputating limbs and organs<br> from thousands,...<br> ...operating without anaesthetics,<br> but with the strength of Wagner...<br> ...providing an obbligato<br> to the screams of the mutants...<br> ...he was creating!<br> - Don't lecture me!<br> Sidney... you owe me something.<br> Even if only to humour an old man...<br> ...who once brought you<br> a page-one international story.<br> You owe me this much, Sidney.<br> Now I'm collecting.<br> Have you any idea how many men<br> in their mid-60s die every day?<br> I try not to think about it.<br> Save it for your wife, Herr Dring.<br> What I've got is too good for her.<br> I can see that, Herr Dring!<br> Go on, go on.<br> Pig!<br> Good boy. Good boy.<br> Seibert!<br> News?<br> Good news.<br> Our salesmen are all checked in.<br> The first quotas have been filled.<br> Four on the exact dates.<br> - Two a day early, and one a day late.<br> - Splendid! Splendid! Come...<br> We'll have a nice lunch.<br> Colonel, I will need a full report<br> on all this for my records.<br> I've already taken care of that.<br> Four out of seven on the exact dates.<br> They are good men.<br> Well chosen.<br> General Rausch called me<br> from the Costa Brava.<br> Why didn't you tell us about Lieberman?<br> I did not think it was necessary.<br> The General is concerned.<br> But Ezra Lieberman...<br> no one takes him seriously.<br> Even the rich Jews<br> who used to send him money...<br> ...have found better ways<br> to ease their consciences.<br> The man's bank has failed.<br> His followers have fallen away.<br> He's entirely without credibility.<br> I just decided it was not important.<br> If you'll forgive me, Herr Doktor,<br> it was not your decision to make.<br> You could have compromised our agents.<br> And if I had told you about Lieberman,...<br> ...you would have<br> compromised my project.<br> How bad would it be if we postponed<br> for three or four months?<br> That would reduce the outcome<br> by 20 per cent.<br> There are 18 men in the first four months.<br> It would change the results completely.<br> Assuming there is an outcome.<br> There will be exactly the results<br> I have promised.<br> General Rausch<br> wanted to recall these six men.<br> Impossible!<br> Until we find out<br> how much Lieberman knows.<br> Impossible! This project has a timetable<br> that must be observed.<br> - It cannot be changed.<br> - Herr Doktor...<br> Colonel, do you fully understand<br> what it is that I have done?<br> I...<br> ...the outlaw.<br> The so-called war criminal.<br> Right here in this godforsaken place,<br> I have created a scientific miracle.<br> I have turned the whole world<br> into a laboratory.<br> Our laboratory.<br> Don't talk to me about six men.<br> I would send out six more<br> if they were caught.<br> And six more, and six more,<br> until the task was done.<br> I agree, Herr Doktor.<br> I agree. Let's hope that we can resolve<br> this Lieberman business...<br> ...and that you get to put 94 check marks...<br> ...on that beautiful chart of yours.<br> Come. Walk me to the plane.<br> You see how...<br> passionate I am on this subject?<br> Uh-huh.<br> One day this place will be a shrine<br> visited by millions of schoolchildren.<br> That is a nice thought.<br> Nice thought.<br> - Gladbeck, 3.30, Ezra.<br> - We'll get there. We'll get there.<br> When do I ever miss a train?<br> Now, you know what to do<br> while I'm away?<br> Go through all those clippings, separate<br> them by countries, then cities.<br> Isolate all violent crime.<br> Ezra, there are more than 100 clippings,<br> and Beynon says there are more to come.<br> Well, we have to start somewhere.<br> Yes, but we can't afford<br> to hunt for all those men.<br> That's why I'm going to these cities first -<br> the closest and the cheapest. It's a start.<br> Yes, but...<br> Remember to separate the ones<br> in New England from the rest.<br> I can cover them on the lecture tour.<br> Still without any help.<br> Without help, without money,<br> without time. What else is new?<br> I'm more in love with you<br> It's not the feeling it will give you<br> for the things gone by<br> It's when you look at all the things...<br> The landlord!<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To turn that damn tape off.<br> Leave it! I like music.<br> Well, he doesn't. He's always prowling<br> around the landing, listening at my door!<br> - Just waiting to catch me.<br> - Catch you? Doing what?<br> Just what we're doing now, love.<br> Mr Harrington doesn't like any mucking<br> around. He has a wife and kid, you know!<br> Old coot! Bet he wouldn't say no<br> if I invited him in here.<br> Then maybe we'll invite him in...<br> ...later.<br> Is this Frau Dring's residence?<br> My name is Lieberman.<br> Thank you.<br> I think she's off the phone by now.<br> You her grandson?<br> Her son.<br> Herr Lieberman!<br> Frau Dring,<br> thank you so much for seeing me.<br> Oh! Won't you sit down?<br> Thank you.<br> You are the man who was on television<br> several months ago.<br> The Nazi-hunter. Frieda Maloney.<br> Yes.<br> - Do you kill Nazis when you catch them?<br> - No, that's against the law.<br> It's much better to put them on trial<br> so people can learn.<br> Learn what?<br> Who they were. What they did.<br> So why even catch them?<br> Just put it all in history books.<br> Clever boy you have, Frau Dring!<br> Yes. But, er... definitely lazy.<br> For example, right now<br> he should be in his room practising.<br> I can't be in my room<br> and answer the door at the same time,...<br> ...can I?<br> - Oh, I was only teasing, darling!<br> Now, please, go and practise, hm?<br> Now... we can talk.<br> First of all, may I express my sympathy?<br> Things must be very difficult for you...<br> ...right now.<br> Thank you.<br> Is he your only child?<br> Yes.<br> Did your husband leave all his money<br> to Erich and you?<br> And to a sister of his.<br> Why do you ask that?<br> I was looking for a reason<br> behind his death.<br> Emil's death was an accident.<br> Was he a Nazi?<br> I did not meet him until 1955,<br> so I have no way of knowing.<br> Did he ever...<br> ...mention the name of<br> a Doktor Josef Mengele?<br> Who?<br> There was a considerable age difference<br> between you, wasn't there?<br> Oh! That wasn't the only difference!<br> I was 20, straight off the farm,...<br> ...and he was Mr High and Mighty<br> of the Transport Commission.<br> Erm... 43, I think he was.<br> Did he... have any hobbies?<br> No.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, he did have one special hobby,<br> Herr Lieberman.<br> He humiliated and beat my son<br> at every given opportunity.<br> Would you like me to tell you<br> who really killed him?<br> God!<br> To set free a stupid little farm girl,<br> after 22 years of unhappiness!<br> Do Nazis answer prayers,<br> Herr Lieberman?<br> No. That is God's business.<br> And I have thanked him<br> every night since...<br> ...he pushed Emil under that car.<br> He could have done it sooner.<br> But I thank him, anyway.<br> We're home again<br> This time, for sure<br> We are home again<br> So close the door<br> And this time<br> What we've got, let's be thankful for<br> It's cold out there<br> Who the hell are you?<br> Come in, Mr Harrington.<br> She wants to talk to you.<br> - I'll talk to her.<br> - That would be nice.<br> John!<br> John!<br> Simon, stop playing with those puppets<br> and go and wash your hands.<br> Hello?<br> I'm on my way, Mother!<br> If you'd hold on, I'll just get her.<br> Nancy!<br> Nancy! Telephone, Nancy!<br> Nancy!<br> Nancy!<br> Nancy!<br> Nancy!<br> Nancy, you can't spend your life in bed.<br> Nancy!<br> Good! Good! Incredibly precise!<br> Everything right on schedule.<br> You did not have to make the trip, Seibert.<br> You could have used the radio.<br> Not that I do not welcome<br> a little intelligent company down here.<br> Gunther remembered the digital clock<br> you admired so much in his home.<br> Why, thank you, my friend.<br> Very nice of you.<br> Such a rational device.<br> - Remarkable.<br> - There is a problem.<br> Lieberman.<br> He was in Gladbeck, in Dring's house.<br> Could he possibly<br> have found out about Dring?<br> - You don't know?<br> - How could I?<br> - The boy, Kohler?<br> - Impossible.<br> Then how did Lieberman get to Dring?<br> Sheer coincidence.<br> That's not a very scientific explanation,<br> is it, Doktor?<br> Are you interrogating me,<br> Colonel Seibert?<br> General Rausch put me<br> in charge of security.<br> How can I function<br> if I don't have all the facts?<br> But you do!<br> A nosy, incompetent old Jew<br> has bumbled onto one victim.<br> What more do you have to know?<br> Any idiot could see the next logical step.<br> - Kill him!<br> - We don't want to create a martyr!<br> Ridiculous!<br> Besides, he could have contacted<br> police agencies or intelligence services.<br> They would not pay any attention to him!<br> If he died suddenly, they would.<br> Well,...<br> ...then what are you going to do?<br> Lieberman will have to be watched<br> more carefully.<br> If he gets too close,<br> a decision will be made.<br> We will balance<br> the danger of killing Lieberman...<br> ...against the scientific validity<br> of your project.<br> Are you, my esteemed Chief of Security,<br> telling me...<br> ...that a project 20 years and millions of<br> dollars in the making will be dropped...<br> ...because of this insignificant,<br> impudent old Jew?<br> Do not antagonise me, Doktor Mengele.<br> I have been one of your few supporters<br> since this Lieberman business began.<br> And should I drop to my knees<br> in gratitude?<br> Listen to me, Seibert.<br> I will not permit you to lay your failure<br> or your fear at my door.<br> I am a scientist. I have done my job.<br> You are an executioner. Do yours!<br> Ezra!<br> Ah! A reception committee! How nice!<br> - So, how did it go?<br> - Oh, a very rewarding trip.<br> The Krassner death at Freiburn<br> was a genuine accident...<br> ...witnessed by many people.<br> At Gladbeck, I met a young housewife...<br> ...who was not exactly heartbroken<br> by the death of her old husband.<br> And at Prozheim<br> they slammed the door in my face.<br> That's the way it will be<br> with most of these people.<br> - I know. Come, let's get a coffee.<br> - Yes, please.<br> Excuse me. Mr Lieberman?<br> My name is David Bennett. I think you<br> know a friend of mine - Barry Kohler?<br> Oh, are you the boy who's been calling?<br> What news of Mr Kohler?<br> None.<br> - I know he was working with you.<br> - That is not correct.<br> - He was in contact with you.<br> - How do you know?<br> From letters we received.<br> - "We"?<br> - The Young Jewish Defenders.<br> Oh, they're a bunch of fanatics.<br> Kohler told me he worked alone.<br> Yes. And he did, thanks to you.<br> After he read your books,<br> he decided to change his methods.<br> I did not send your friend to Paraguay.<br> He sent me these.<br> To prove that he wasn't off<br> on some wild-goose chase.<br> He couldn't identify these three,<br> so I traced them.<br> This is Kleist.<br> Hessen. And Schwimmer.<br> Members of a neo-Nazi organisation<br> in Paraguay.<br> This has nothing to do with me.<br> - Is Kohler's life nothing to do with you?<br> - You have no right to talk that way!<br> - Is Barry Kohler still alive?<br> - How do I know?<br> Mr Lieberman, Barry is dead!<br> You know that, and I know that!<br> And that's why I'm here -<br> to pick up where he left off.<br> - That means with you.<br> - I work alone.<br> I'm not asking you for a job!<br> I simply want some information.<br> I can't help you.<br> I won't leave you until you talk to me.<br> I will plant myself on your doorstep<br> and I'll be waiting every morning.<br> You're stuck with me until<br> you give me information.<br> Ezra, I got another envelope<br> of clippings from Beynon.<br> A big one.<br> All right, young man. We'll talk.<br> Good morning.<br> I'm looking for the village of Storlien.<br> You're going the wrong way.<br> Turn around and take the south road<br> for about 16 km.<br> Then bear right. You can't miss it.<br> Thanks.<br> - What are you doing in these parts?<br> - What?<br> You are not Swedish.<br> I come from Dortmund originally,<br> but...<br> ...I live in Stockholm now.<br> I have spent some time<br> in Germany myself.<br> Come now! Mundt!<br> - What's happened to your memory!<br> - My God! Major Hartung!<br> I knew it was you!<br> Can't believe it!<br> What in the world are you doing up here!<br> It's no great story.<br> My sister was married to a Swede.<br> After I escaped from the internment camp,<br> I hid out with them.<br> I am Lars Lfquist now, inspector of<br> the power company. What about you?<br> I come up here on a job,<br> for the Comrades Organisation.<br> In Sweden?<br> My God, what's going on? Can you<br> tell me or would it violate orders?<br> To hell with orders! I'm sick of orders!<br> I'm here in Storlien to kill<br> a schoolteacher by Saturday.<br> But don't ask me why.<br> I cannot make head or tail of it.<br> Who is this teacher?<br> Lundberg? Olafsson?<br> Lundberg.<br> But I don't know what he looks like.<br> He's probably a harmless old man!<br> It doesn't make any sense!<br> It makes sense to your superiors. Or they<br> wouldn't have given you the assignment.<br> An order is an order.<br> Good God, man!<br> You are an officer of the SS!<br> Have you forgotten?<br> "My honour is loyalty. "<br> Those words were supposed to be<br> engraved on your soul.<br> I know Lundberg.<br> I will point him out to you.<br> It isn't Lundberg.<br> And it doesn't have to be Saturday.<br> No one would have wanted to kill Jack.<br> The man was beloved.<br> If you had seen the wreaths<br> his students sent!<br> I have only one or two<br> more questions to ask.<br> Did your husband belong to<br> any international group?<br> Uh...<br> He was in the American Legion.<br> Rotary... I guess that's international.<br> The Legion sent a Colour Guard<br> to the funeral.<br> The coffin was draped<br> in the American flag.<br> What are you doing out of bed?<br> I just came to get a glass<br> of grapefruit juice.<br> He's got the flu.<br> I thought he could stay home<br> a few days because of it.<br> This is Jack Curry Jr.<br> Just Jack Curry... now.<br> Jack, you bite your tongue.<br> This is Mr Lieberman.<br> A famous man from Vienna,...<br> ...in Austria.<br> - What's he famous for?<br> This is fantastic!<br> You know you have a double?<br> A boy who lives in Gladbeck in Germany,<br> exactly like you!<br> Exactly like me?<br> I never saw anything like it! Two twin<br> brothers could not be more the same.<br> Jack, you go up to bed<br> and I'll bring you your juice.<br> - I want to find out...<br> - When you start paying the doctor bills,...<br> ...you can get sick all you want.<br> Just say goodbye...<br> ...and go.<br> Jesus H Christ! Goodbye!<br> You watch your mouth, young man!<br> It is amazing!<br> I thought he was this young boy<br> from Germany come to visit you!<br> Even the voice... the look in the eyes...<br> Look, I don't like to be rude, but, as you<br> can see, I got a lot of things to do here.<br> Look, I'm sure that nobody<br> shot Big Jack on purpose.<br> It was a horrible accident.<br> If you'll excuse me?<br> - Hello. Is this the Harrington residence?<br> - Yes, this is the Harrington residence.<br> - Can I talk to your mother, please?<br> - Well, you could, but you can't.<br> This will only take a moment.<br> - My mother isn't receiving today.<br> - Well, perhaps if you told her...<br> Don't you understand English, you arse?<br> We are not at home!<br> Wilcox had two married daughters.<br> No... No sons.<br> The Harringtons...<br> Did they have any children?<br> What did the boy look like?<br> Sort of pale.<br> He had straight dark hair. Very dark.<br> Blue eyes.<br> Yeah, I'm listening.<br> Why do you wanna know<br> about the kids all of a sudden?<br> Listen, Mr Bennett,...<br> ...if you want to ask the questions,<br> you pay for the phone call.<br> No,...<br> ...nothing.<br> No, I haven't found a link.<br> No! I'm... in the dark.<br> I'll call you tomorrow, I promise.<br> Coming.<br> I have to speak to you, Mr Lieberman.<br> Well, come in.<br> I was just coming to see you.<br> - Sit down.<br> - No, I can't stay long.<br> Jack Jr doesn't know where I've gone.<br> Mr Lieberman,...<br> ...my son is the only thing I've got.<br> You can't take him away from me.<br> I have no intention...<br> When you spoke about<br> that other boy, I got worried.<br> The lady who gave Jack Jr to us<br> made us swear never to tell anyone.<br> Your son's adopted?<br> It's just that... she was a German lady.<br> She was very nice, really.<br> I was amazed when I read in the papers<br> about all the things you said she did.<br> Frieda Maloney!<br> Oh, God!<br> I knew I should never have come here!<br> Will you give me your word that you do<br> not have a recording device in your bag?<br> Thank you.<br> Do you have the depositions?<br> I have brought one.<br> It was agreed you would provide<br> an advance look...<br> ...at all the testimony against my client.<br> With particular regard to scars, deformity<br> or disability suffered by witnesses.<br> This deposition is brought in good faith.<br> Two others will come if the interview<br> should prove satisfactory.<br> You realise how unjust all this is?<br> Mrs Maloney has been married<br> to an American citizen for 27 years.<br> She has two children. One grandchild.<br> I suppose this can be... corroborated?<br> By the mother of the child<br> and three other surviving witnesses.<br> We will keep the interview brief.<br> We will discuss only my client's activities<br> in America between 1964 and '67.<br> You will ask nothing about<br> the charges against her...<br> ...or about any event that occurred<br> during or directly after the war.<br> One question of that nature and I will<br> immediately terminate the interview.<br> So... I am to speak to you about<br> my work with the adoption agency.<br> Correct.<br> I don't mind.<br> What I did may have been<br> slightly illegal, but...<br> ...I brought happiness<br> to so many people, huh?<br> Now tell me, if you will,<br> how you came to work for this agency.<br> In the spring of 1963...<br> ...I was contacted by someone I knew<br> in the Comrades Organisation.<br> Who?<br> Frau Maloney will not answer that.<br> They'd helped me after the war...<br> ...and wanted me to return the favour<br> by getting a job in an adoption agency.<br> Did they say why?<br> If you let me finish, you'll find out.<br> The Rush-Gaddis agency hired me.<br> The Comrades Organisation<br> was interested in rejects.<br> Couples who were denied children<br> because the husband was too old.<br> I looked for applications from families<br> with Nordic Christian backgrounds,...<br> ...in which the husband was born<br> between 1910 and 1914, and the wife...<br> ...between 1933 and 1937.<br> The husband had to work<br> in something like the civil service.<br> And both spouses<br> had to be in perfect health.<br> - Did they explain why they wanted this?<br> - That information is not relevant.<br> I was expected to obey my orders,<br> not to question them.<br> This I did, as I always had.<br> About a year after that...<br> ...I was ordered to contact applicants and<br> offer them a healthy white baby boy,...<br> ...with New York State adoption papers.<br> They were to pay me $500.<br> After their medical certificates had been<br> cleared, they would receive the babies.<br> We would meet at a motel<br> near Kennedy Airport.<br> That used to be Idlewild.<br> The babies were delivered to me,...<br> ...usually by stewardesses<br> with Varig Airlines.<br> Varig?<br> Did the babies all come from Brazil?<br> Is that important to you?<br> What did they look like?<br> They were all beautiful little boys...<br> ...with black hair, piercing blue eyes...<br> If you're looking for a long-lost Jewish<br> grandson, he was not among them.<br> How many couples<br> did you give the babies to?<br> About 20.<br> - Only Americans?<br> - Some were Canadian.<br> - No Europeans?<br> - No.<br> Can you remember a Curry family?<br> - A Curry, yes.<br> - Who else?<br> Wheelock. Henry Wheelock.<br> They gave me my dog, Schatzie.<br> Beautiful Doberman.<br> He was only 10 weeks old when I got him.<br> Where is Wheelock from?<br> New Providence, Pennsylvania.<br> And how long after the Currys<br> did the Wheelocks get their baby?<br> It was 14 years ago! I don't remember.<br> And what has Josef Mengele<br> to do with all this?<br> We won't answer that.<br> It was all a trick, wasn't it!<br> I know nothing of Mengele!<br> But you'll link me with him, won't you?<br> You want your pound of flesh!<br> Nobody cares!<br> And you persist and persist!<br> Now why don't you get off my back?<br> One more minor question.<br> - I'll say nothing to you!<br> - As you wish.<br> This interview has not<br> gone to my satisfaction.<br> I will therefore withhold the other<br> two depositions we talked about.<br> You lying Jewish schmuck!<br> You are not a guard now, madam!<br> You are a prisoner!<br> I may leave here empty-handed,...<br> ...but you...<br> ...are not going anywhere.<br> I think Frau Maloney<br> could answer one more question.<br> When is your dog's birthday?<br> You are an insane old man<br> after all, aren't you?<br> Schatzie's birthday?<br> It was December 11th.<br> Why Mengele?<br> David's off to New York for his sister's<br> wedding, but he'll be back in a week.<br> Mengele...<br> ...gives babies...<br> He kills Dring, Harrington, Curry...<br> They got their babies four weeks apart,...<br> ...and the fathers were killed<br> four weeks apart.<br> Wheelock...<br> Maloney's dog was born December 11th,<br> ten weeks...<br> I've already worked it out. February 20th.<br> That's only four days from now!<br> Wheelock...<br> New Providence, Pennsylvania.<br> How can I call Wheelock and<br> tell him he's going to be killed...<br> ...by the people who gave him his baby?<br> By Josef Mengele, who's already killed<br> the fathers of at least two other boys...<br> ...who happen to be twins!<br> Who would believe<br> such a preposterous story?<br> Herr Doktor, how kind of you to come!<br> Pleasure to be here.<br> Can this be little Elsa?<br> Yes! You remember!<br> Last time I saw you,...<br> ...you were that high.<br> You had whooping cough.<br> No, no.<br> I'm going to dance<br> with your beautiful daughter.<br> Good evening. How are you?<br> May I present to you my wife Gertrud?<br> - My love, Doktor Mengele.<br> - It is such an honour meeting you!<br> We're here on a little second honeymoon.<br> You're supposed to be in Kristianstad<br> getting ready to kill Oscarsson.<br> Traitor!<br> No!<br> He betrayed me!<br> He betrayed you!<br> He betrayed the Aryan race!<br> Get a doctor!<br> I am a doctor, idiot!<br> Don't you come near him!<br> Shut up, you ugly bitch!<br> - I thought you knew.<br> - Hold still, hold still.<br> Doktor Mengele?<br> Could I call you away from surgery<br> for one moment?<br> If you'll excuse me?<br> Why was I not told that<br> that man was called back?<br> All the men have been recalled.<br> Recalled?<br> They should all be back here<br> by the end of the week.<br> But why? What has happened?<br> Lieberman visited Frieda Maloney...<br> ...in prison.<br> Lieberman again? Will I be plagued<br> to my dying day by that infernal Jew?<br> Maloney told him about the adoptions.<br> Well, that's not catastrophic, Seibert.<br> She only knows about America.<br> The work can continue in Europe.<br> The Organisation does not share<br> your optimism, Herr Doktor.<br> But all Lieberman has are a few<br> paltry shreds of information.<br> That means that,<br> according to your figures,...<br> ...we can be sure of one or two successes.<br> And if my calculations are wrong? And<br> there's only one chance in 20 or 30?<br> No, Seibert. The men must go back.<br> They can't.<br> The operation has been terminated.<br> Terminated?<br> By whose authority?<br> General Rausch, and the Colonel's.<br> I told you...<br> I told you from the beginning, kill him.<br> Kill him! It would have been so easy!<br> It has gone beyond Lieberman.<br> We don't know who else is involved.<br> You have betrayed me!<br> You are all a bunch of selfish old men<br> who have lost your courage!<br> You only want to bask in the sun<br> in your old age!<br> And if your Aryan grandchildren have to<br> live in a world which is run by Jews...<br> ...and Blacks and Orientals and slobs,<br> you could not care less!<br> Your operation has been cancelled.<br> No!<br> Your operation has been cancelled.<br> Mine continues.<br> Heil Hitler.<br> This Mengele was sort of a primitive<br> geneticist in his own way, wasn't he?<br> I understand that he experimented<br> on human beings.<br> Twins.<br> Then he was nothing more<br> than a sadist, really.<br> A sadist with an MD and a PhD.<br> Well, some people would say<br> that's a perfect definition of a scientist.<br> What exactly do you mean when you say<br> the boys you saw were more than twins?<br> Not only did they look alike but<br> they were also very alike in personality.<br> That is unusual.<br> Twins who are separated at birth<br> develop totally different personalities.<br> But these twins, or perhaps<br> I should say triplets,...<br> ...because I believe<br> my associate saw another,...<br> ...were like the same people,...<br> ...but brought up with different languages.<br> It's impossible, of course.<br> Excuse me, Doctor,<br> but what is impossible?<br> What is impossible, Doctor?<br> Mononuclear reproduction.<br> Oh... Doctor...<br> Cloning.<br> What if I were to tell you that I could take<br> a scraping of skin from your finger...<br> ...and create another Ezra Lieberman?<br> I would tell you not to waste<br> your time on my finger.<br> Anyway, that is cloning.<br> It was first done with plants. A cutting<br> taken from a plant and transplanted...<br> ...grew to be the exact duplicate<br> of the donor plant.<br> Now we are doing the same thing<br> with laboratory animals.<br> You mean you can produce<br> an animal from itself?<br> We take the unfertilised egg<br> of an ovulating female...<br> ...and destroy all of its genes<br> and chromosomes.<br> We then implant the nucleus<br> of the donor cell,...<br> ...which could be taken from a blood<br> sample, or even a skin scraping.<br> That cell,<br> with its genetic material intact,...<br> ...eventually becomes an embryo<br> and is born as a living creature.<br> Without parents?<br> Well, it has no father<br> because the egg was never fertilised.<br> No mother, because its genetic code<br> comes from another being.<br> Can you follow that?<br> And this creature<br> is an exact duplicate of itself?<br> Oh, Doctor, how can that be?<br> Come along.<br> Our experiments began with the simplest<br> of animals: shrimps and frogs.<br> Animals in which the female's eggs<br> are fertilised externally.<br> Then we moved on to mammals.<br> We tried several laboratory animals<br> and found the rabbit most convenient.<br> I had to develop instruments<br> which could accomplish the operation...<br> ...and a whole micro-injection system.<br> I'll show you how it's done.<br> Here we are removing the eggs<br> of a white rabbit...<br> ...from the Fallopian tubes.<br> Now you see the egg<br> under a microscope.<br> I have brought the point of an ordinary<br> sewing needle into view...<br> ...to give an idea of the size.<br> - They are that small?<br> Most mammal eggs are about that size.<br> - Including human eggs?<br> - Yes.<br> The next step is to destroy<br> the egg nucleus...<br> ...with ultraviolet light...<br> ...so that none of its genetic makeup<br> remains.<br> Now you see an egg from a white rabbit...<br> ...ready to be injected with the blood cell<br> from a black rabbit donor.<br> With the injection pipette...<br> ...one of the blood cells is sucked up<br> and then injected into the egg.<br> After a few hours,<br> the eggs in culture divide...<br> ...and are ready to be put back<br> into the female.<br> There they grow into embryos...<br> ...which, in a month's time,<br> the normal gestation period,...<br> ...will become baby rabbits.<br> In this instance...<br> ...a black litter from a white mother.<br> Their black colour proves<br> that they have been cloned...<br> ...from the blood cell of a black rabbit.<br> But isn't it difficult<br> to get the egg back into the female?<br> Transferring the eggs isn't a problem. We<br> do it all the time with laboratory animals.<br> The really tricky part is the microsurgery.<br> Getting the donor cell into the egg.<br> You're lucky if one in ten survives.<br> And this can be done with humans?<br> If the technique were precise enough.<br> - It's monstrous, Doctor!<br> - Why?<br> Wouldn't you want to live in a world<br> full of Mozarts and Picassos?<br> Of course, it's only a dream.<br> Not only would you have to reproduce<br> the genetic code of the donor,...<br> ...but the environmental background<br> as well.<br> Is Mengele trying to reproduce himself?<br> No. He has brown eyes and he comes<br> from a very wealthy family.<br> Let's examine the family background...<br> ...of the donor.<br> The father is 65 years old.<br> A civil servant.<br> The mother is 42, you say?<br> She dotes on the child.<br> Spoils...<br> The boy is...<br> ...pale.<br> Dark hair.<br> Blue eyes.<br> Spoilt.<br> Right?<br> Now, Mengele would certainly know<br> every social and environmental detail...<br> ...would have to be reproduced.<br> If the parents were divorced<br> when the boy was ten,...<br> ...this would have to be arranged.<br> Doctor Bruckner,...<br> ...the one who is cloned,...<br> ...the donor.<br> - He has to be alive, doesn't he?<br> - Not necessarily.<br> Individual cells taken from a donor<br> can be preserved indefinitely.<br> With a sample of Mozart's blood, and<br> the women, someone with the skill...<br> ...could breed a few hundred<br> baby Mozarts.<br> My God,...<br> ...if it's really been done,...<br> ...what I'd give to see one of those boys!<br> Herr Lieberman?<br> Herr Lieberman...<br> Not Mozart, Doctor.<br> Not Picasso.<br> Not a genius who would<br> enrich the world...<br> ...but a lonely little boy,<br> with a domineering father,...<br> ...a customs officer,...<br> ...who was 52 when he was born.<br> And...<br> ...an affectionate, doting mother...<br> ...who was 29.<br> The father died at 65...<br> ...when the boy was nearly 14.<br> Adolf Hitler.<br> Colonel Seibert!<br> You Lieberman?<br> Ja.<br> Come on in.<br> Okay, boys.<br> Beautiful dogs!<br> Tear the throat out of anyone<br> who even looks cross-eyed at me.<br> I guess you can see why I didn't exactly<br> wet my pants when you said...<br> ...someone was out to get me.<br> Take off your coat.<br> Very impressive.<br> Yeah.<br> My son took those pictures.<br> Very good!<br> Very good.<br> A little artsy-fartsy, if you ask me.<br> Is your son at home?<br> No. He's in school.<br> And, er... Mrs Wheelock?<br> - Is she at home?<br> - She's still at work.<br> So, you're the guy who got<br> that Nazi Eichmann?<br> I located him.<br> It was the Israelis<br> who did the actual kidnapping.<br> How much you get for that?<br> Nothing.<br> I did it for the satisfaction. I hate all Nazis.<br> I don't know about Nazis.<br> It's the niggers we gotta worry about.<br> Why are these Nazis after me?<br> Well...<br> I find it... very hard to talk.<br> Don't worry about them. They won't<br> bother you. Unless you bother me.<br> I was attacked by a dog<br> when I was a child.<br> A German shepherd.<br> And I still feel uncomfortable<br> with a dog in the room.<br> Jesus! You're like my neighbour Wally.<br> He won't walk up the driveway<br> unless the dogs are locked up.<br> Okay...<br> Come on, boys. In you go.<br> There's no other way<br> that they can come in?<br> No.<br> Thank you.<br> I feel much better.<br> - Hey!<br> - Put your hands up.<br> What the hell are you up to, anyway?<br> Is there a basement in this house?<br> Yeah.<br> Take me to it.<br> Do you have any pictures of your son?<br> There's an album on the table.<br> What do you want them for?<br> Please do not worry. I am very anxious<br> to see him and talk to him.<br> I am the doctor who delivered him.<br> Open the door.<br> Go down the stairs, Mr Wheelock.<br> Now listen. I don't give doodley-shit<br> about Jews or Nazis.<br> Good!<br> Tell me, please,<br> which way to Quarryville?<br> Down here to the end of the exit.<br> Take a left straight into Quarryville.<br> Thank you.<br> Quiet, damn you!<br> Bobby!<br> Dear, dear boy.<br> Mr Wheelock?<br> Mr Wheelock?<br> Mr Wheelock!<br> Mr...<br> You!<br> Herr Lieberman!<br> Get up.<br> Jew!<br> Up!<br> Up!<br> Yes... I am going to kill you.<br> But I want you to die with the knowledge<br> that all your efforts have gone for nothing!<br> I have the money and I have the will!<br> And no one can stop me!<br> Did you kill Wheelock?<br> No... he's in the kitchen,<br> mixing us some cocktails!<br> You know what I saw on the television<br> in my motel room...<br> ...at one o'clock this morning?<br> Films of Hitler.<br> They're showing films about the war.<br> The movement!<br> People are fascinated!<br> The time is ripe!<br> Adolf Hitler... is alive!<br> This album is full of pictures of him.<br> Bobby Wheelock and 93 other boys<br> are exact genetic duplicates of him.<br> Bred entirely from his cells.<br> He allowed me to take half a litre of his<br> blood and a cutting of skin from his ribs.<br> We were in a biblical frame of mind...<br> ...on 23rd May, 1943,...<br> ...at the Berghof.<br> He had denied himself children because<br> he knew that no son could flourish...<br> ...in the shadow of so God-like a father!<br> But then he heard<br> what was theoretically possible,...<br> ...that I could create one day not his son,<br> not even a carbon copy,...<br> ...but another original!<br> He was thrilled by the idea!<br> The right Hitler for the right future!<br> A Hitler tailor-made...<br> ...for the 1980s,...<br> ...'90s,...<br> ...2000!<br> Kill!<br> Kill!<br> Get away!<br> Off!<br> No more gun?<br> Holy shit!<br> Bobby!<br> Bobby...<br> My dear, dear boy!<br> You cannot imagine how happy I am,<br> how joyous I am,...<br> ...to see you standing there<br> so fine and strong...<br> ...and healthy!<br> Call these dogs off, Bobby.<br> Call the dogs off, please.<br> I am an old friend of the family.<br> In fact, I am the doctor who delivered you.<br> And I stopped by,<br> having just returned from abroad,...<br> ...and he let me in.<br> And then he pulled out...<br> ...a gun!<br> Fortunately, I was able to overpower him.<br> Now call them off, Bobby. Call them off.<br> Please.<br> Cut!<br> Cut - how clever!<br> I said "off" and I said "away",...<br> ...and I said "no gun, no more gun"...<br> Then you had the gun.<br> - No! He had...<br> - They attack anyone with a gun!<br> - They were locked up...<br> - The dogs are never locked up.<br> Bobby... My dear, dear...<br> Action!<br> Cut! Cut!<br> They won't listen to you.<br> I...<br> Bobby, that man is your enemy.<br> Do not listen to him, I beg of you!<br> Call... the police.<br> Yeah.<br> By all means, do so, Bobby.<br> But first there are some things<br> about yourself you must know.<br> What do you mean?<br> If I prove to you that I know you better<br> than anyone in the world,...<br> ...better even than your own mother,<br> will you listen to me?<br> You are a clever boy,...<br> ...are you not?<br> You do not do well in school.<br> That is because you are too clever.<br> Too busy thinking your own thoughts.<br> But you are much smarter<br> than your teachers, uh?<br> My teachers are nowhere.<br> You are going to be the world's<br> greatest photographer, are you not?<br> Have you ever felt superior<br> to those around you?<br> Like a prince among peasants?<br> I feel different from everyone sometimes.<br> You are infinitely different.<br> Infinitely superior.<br> You were born of the<br> noblest blood in the world.<br> You have it within you to fulfil ambitions<br> a thousand times greater...<br> ...than those of which<br> you presently dream!<br> And you shall fulfil them, Bobby!<br> You shall!<br> You are the living duplicate<br> of the greatest man in history.<br> Adolf Hitler.<br> Oh, man, you're weird!<br> Bobby, I'm telling you the truth!<br> Find... your... father.<br> What?<br> He killed...<br> ...your... father.<br> Bobby! Listen to me!<br> It was this vicious Jew,...<br> ...your sworn enemy!<br> He killed your father,<br> and he came here to kill you!<br> Bobby!<br> Let me protect you!<br> All your power will burst forth<br> when the time comes,...<br> ...when you grow older!<br> And you see the world<br> engulfed by human garbage!<br> When you feel this urge<br> rising within you...<br> ...to save your own Aryan folk<br> from extinction!<br> Then you will rejoice in your heritage...<br> ...and bless me for creating you!<br> Bobby!<br> You must understand your parents<br> are of no importance!<br> They were chosen for you!<br> Now that they have served their purpose,<br> they must disappear from your life!<br> Bobby!<br> Bobby!<br> You freaked-out maniac!<br> Print!<br> Bobby...<br> Holy shit!<br> Cut!<br> Cut!<br> Cut!<br> Phew, man... Get outta here.<br> Out.<br> You'll die if I don't call<br> an ambulance for you.<br> I could just go out right now.<br> My mom won't be home until late.<br> You'll be dead by then.<br> If I call the police,<br> will you tell them what I did?<br> Okay.<br> Shake.<br> Come on, shake!<br> Okay. You got a deal.<br> I'd like an ambulance<br> and a police car...<br> ...at the Wheelock residence<br> on Old Buck Road, please.<br> Hey, man, this is an emergency!<br> A heavy-duty emergency.<br> David!<br> What a surprise!<br> Which assassin was it, Mr Lieberman?<br> I thought you went to a wedding!<br> No more deception now.<br> No more blind alleys.<br> It was Mengele.<br> He's dead.<br> It's over.<br> The Dring boy isn't dead yet.<br> Neither is Simon Harrington<br> or Jack Curry or Bobby Wheelock.<br> It took a little time,...<br> ...a little backtracking,<br> a visit to Dr Bruckner.<br> But now we know... everything.<br> And what are you going to do about it?<br> Kill the boys.<br> Brilliant man, that Mengele.<br> I suppose he had all 94 of those names<br> and addresses memorised.<br> Now you are trying to fool me.<br> - You have been searching the room.<br> - He must have had a list.<br> He did. I have it.<br> - Give it to me.<br> - Why?<br> We have the right and we have the duty.<br> To do what? Kill children?<br> Give me that list.<br> You will have to take it from me.<br> And, when you do,<br> you can add my name to the list.<br> I don't mean you any harm.<br> You will have to kill me, David.<br> The first of those boys that you touch,...<br> ...I will turn you and your entire<br> organisation over to the police.<br> I will do that.<br> You would protect Hitler?<br> Not... slaughter the innocent,...<br> ...and neither will you.<br> A fanatic you may be, but a murderer<br> of young children you are not.<br> There is a nurse here, an angel of mercy<br> called Miss Hanrahan,...<br> ...who actually gives me cigarettes.<br> You know what she said?<br> She said, "Mr Lieberman,<br> if you can escape Buchenwald,...<br> ...and you can escape those bullets,...<br> ...then a few cigarettes<br> will not hurt you."<br> Isn't that a nice thing to say?<br> Man!<br>
