                        Finish work!<br> Go to hut.<br> Yeah, that figures.<br> If the new prisoners see us<br> digging graves, they may run.<br> No time for jokes. Finish work!<br> Dig, dig.<br> How about putting us<br> on sick list?<br> Have a heart, captain.<br> Put us in hospital.<br> You no sick. You never sick.<br> Why you always play sick<br> to me, Shears?<br> Don't want one of these<br> over my head, I guess.<br> Captain Kanematsu...<br> ...how about a butt?<br> I give you butt this morning.<br> Both of you.<br> That's what I mean.<br> I want to return the favour.<br> When a man gives a gift<br> from the goodness of his heart...<br> ...like you gave me that butt,<br> I remember it from the heart.<br> That's why...<br> ...I want you to keep this lighter.<br> Think I stole it?<br> It belonged to that English kid<br> we just buried.<br> He willed it to me<br> for a favour I'd done him.<br> Before I pass on,<br> I want to do the same for you.<br> You funny man, Shears.<br> Okay, you go on sick list. Him too.<br> One of these days Colonel Saito<br> will catch you bribing him...<br> ...then where'll we be?<br> Before that happens<br> we'll be far away from here, chum.<br> Far away.<br> Okay, let's knock off.<br> Here lies....<br> Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.<br> Thomson.<br> Yes.<br> Here lies<br> Corporal Herbert Thomson...<br> ...serial number 01234567.<br> Valiant member of the King's Own<br> or the Queen's Own or something...<br> ...who died of beriberi<br> in the year of our Lord, 1943...<br> ...for the greater glory of....<br> -What did he die for?<br> -Come off it.<br> No need to mock the grave.<br> I don't mock the grave or the man.<br> May he rest in peace.<br> He found little enough of it<br> while he was alive.<br> "A" Company, mark time!<br> Mark time!<br> Halt.<br> Into line, left turn.<br> Stand easy.<br> We're gonna be a busy pair<br> of gravediggers, Weaver.<br> Well done, well done.<br> That colonel doesn't know<br> what he's in for.<br> -You gonna tell him the truth?<br> -Of course not.<br> You're neither an officer<br> nor a gentleman.<br> My name is Nicholson.<br> I am Colonel Saito.<br> In the name of<br> His Imperial Majesty...<br> ...I welcome you.<br> I am the commanding officer<br> of this camp...<br> ...which is Camp 16...<br> ...along the great railroad...<br> ...which will soon connect<br> Bangkok with Rangoon.<br> You British prisoners<br> have been chosen...<br> ...to build a bridge<br> across the River Kwai.<br> It will be pleasant work,<br> requiring skill.<br> And officers will work<br> as well as men.<br> The Japanese army cannot<br> have idle mouths to feed.<br> If you work hard,<br> you will be treated well.<br> But if you do not work hard...<br> ...you will be punished.<br> A word to you about escape.<br> There is no barbed wire.<br> No stockade.<br> No watchtower.<br> They are not necessary.<br> We are an island in the jungle.<br> Escape is impossible.<br> You would die.<br> Today you rest.<br> Tomorrow you'll begin.<br> Let me remind you of<br> General Yamashita's motto:<br> "Be happy in your work."<br> Be happy in your work.<br> Dismissed.<br> Battalion, stand at ease.<br> Fall out, Major Hughes.<br> Battalion, stand easy.<br> Get the men to their quarters.<br> See who's sick.<br> I'm gonna have a word<br> with this fellow. Colonel!<br> I heard your remarks just now, sir.<br> My men will carry on in the way<br> one expects of a British soldier.<br> My officers and I<br> will be responsible for their conduct.<br> You may have overlooked the fact<br> that the use of officers for labour...<br> ...is expressly forbidden<br> by the Geneva Convention.<br> Is that so?<br> I have a copy of the Convention...<br> ...and would be glad to<br> let you glance through it.<br> That will not be necessary.<br> Sit down, please.<br> Yes, sir.<br> -I'm gonna have a word with Clipton.<br> -Very good, sir.<br> Clipton, don't let me interrupt.<br> -How's the arm?<br> -Nearly healed.<br> Sir, this is Commander Shears<br> of the United States Navy.<br> -Good.<br> -How do you do, sir?<br> We found him and an Australian.<br> All that's left of the prisoners<br> who built the camp.<br> U.S. Navy? Out here?<br> For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.<br> -You lost your ship?<br> -The Houston.<br> I made it ashore, but I got separated<br> from the other survivors.<br> And your group here?<br> Mostly Aussies. Some lime--<br> Some British.<br> Indians, Burmese, Siamese.<br> And what happened to them?<br> They died...<br> ...of malaria, dysentery,<br> beriberi, gangrene.<br> Other causes of death:<br> Famine, overwork, bullet wounds,<br> snakebites...<br> ...Saito.<br> Then there were some<br> who just got tired of living.<br> Has Clipton seen you?<br> Just about to, sir. Come over here,<br> commander, you can shave later.<br> All right.<br> You'll stay with the officers.<br> We'll scrape up<br> some decent clothing.<br> Don't bother about me.<br> I'm not anxious to<br> get off the sick list.<br> Besides, this is working kit.<br> It's the fashion out here.<br> The officers in your party<br> did manual labour?<br> I think you could call it that.<br> I raised that very point<br> with Colonel what's-his-name.<br> Saito.<br> -I think he understands now.<br> -Is that so?<br> Yes. I must say he seems<br> quite a reasonable type.<br> Well, I must be pushing on.<br> There's an officer's meeting at 7.<br> -Give me a list of your requirements.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Anything we can do.<br> Oh, thank you, sir.<br> -What is it?<br> -Never mind.<br> Go on, say it.<br> I can think of a lot of things<br> to call Saito...<br> ...but reasonable, that's a new one.<br> Perhaps Colonel Nicholson<br> defines the word differently.<br> Any other points?<br> -By your leave, sir?<br> -Yes, Jennings?<br> About the escape committee.<br> I've spoken with Commander Shears--<br> There won't be any<br> escape committee.<br> I don't understand, sir.<br> Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.<br> Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings<br> has a plan, but escape?<br> Where? Into this jungle?<br> That fellow, Saito, is right.<br> No need for barbed wire here.<br> One chance in 100 of survival.<br> I'm sure a man of Commander Shears'<br> experience will back me up on that.<br> I'd say the odds against a<br> successful escape are 100 to one.<br> -Right.<br> -But may I add another word?<br> Please.<br> The odds against survival in this camp<br> are even worse.<br> You've seen the graveyard.<br> They're your real odds.<br> To give up hope of escape...<br> ...to stop thinking about it,<br> is like accepting a death sentence.<br> Why haven't you tried to escape,<br> commander?<br> I'm biding my time. Waiting for<br> the right moment, the right company.<br> I understand how you feel.<br> Of course, it's the duty of a<br> captured soldier to attempt escape.<br> But my men and I are involved<br> in a curious legal point...<br> ...of which you are unaware.<br> In Singapore we were ordered to<br> surrender by command headquarters.<br> Ordered, mind you.<br> Therefore, in our case, escape might<br> well be an infraction of military law.<br> -Interesting?<br> -Yes, sir, interesting point.<br> I'm sorry, sir,<br> I didn't quite follow you.<br> You intend to uphold the letter<br> of the law, no matter what it costs?<br> Without law, commander,<br> there is no civilisation.<br> That's just my point.<br> Here, there is no civilisation.<br> Then we have the opportunity<br> to introduce it.<br> I suggest we drop<br> the subject of escape.<br> Is there anything else?<br> I think we're all clear<br> on the programme.<br> I want everything to go off without<br> a hitch starting tomorrow morning.<br> And remember this:<br> Our men must always feel<br> they are still commanded by us...<br> ...and not by the Japanese.<br> So long as they have that idea,<br> they'll be soldiers and not slaves.<br> Are you with me there, commander?<br> Well, l....<br> I hope they can<br> remain soldiers, colonel.<br> As for me, I'm just a slave.<br> A living slave.<br> Queer bird. Even for an Ameri--<br> He's been in isolation too long,<br> poor chap.<br> Cut off from his unit.<br> It should be a lesson to all of us.<br> English prisoners!<br> Notice I do not say English soldiers.<br> From the moment you surrendered,<br> you ceased to be soldiers.<br> You will finish the bridge<br> by the 12th day of May.<br> You will work under the direction<br> of a Japanese engineer.<br> Time is short. All men will work.<br> Your officers will work beside you.<br> This is only just...<br> ...for it is they<br> who betrayed you by surrender.<br> Your shame is their dishonour.<br> It is they who told you...<br> ...better to live like a coolie<br> then die like a hero.<br> It is they who brought you here,<br> not I.<br> Therefore, they will join you<br> in useful labour.<br> That is all.<br> Officer prisoners, collect your tools.<br> Bradley, back in your place.<br> I must call your attention,<br> Colonel Saito...<br> ...to Article 27<br> of the Geneva Convention.<br> "Belligerents may employ<br> prisoners of war...<br> ...who are fit,<br> other than officers--"<br> Give me the book.<br> By all means.<br> You read English, I take it?<br> -Do you read Japanese?<br> -I'm sorry, no.<br> If it's a matter of translation,<br> I'm sure it can be arranged.<br> You see, the Code states that--<br> Stand fast in the ranks.<br> You speak to me of code?<br> What code?<br> The coward's code!<br> What do you know<br> of the soldier's code?<br> Of Bushido? Nothing!<br> You are unworthy of command!<br> Since you refuse to abide by the laws<br> of the civilised world...<br> ...we must consider ourselves<br> absolved from our duty to obey you.<br> My officers will not<br> do manual labour.<br> We shall see.<br> All enlisted prisoners to work.<br> Sergeant Major!<br> Take the men to work.<br> Battalion, take up tools.<br> Move to the left in columnar route.<br> Left turn!<br> "A" Company, by the right,<br> quick march.<br> Eyes right.<br> Eyes front.<br> Eyes right.<br> Quick march, eyes right.<br> "C" Company, by the right.<br> What's he up to?<br> Looks like he doesn't<br> want any witnesses.<br> Now, you will be reasonable.<br> You will order your officers to work.<br> No.<br> I will count three.<br> If by the third count...<br> ...you and your officers<br> are not on the way to work...<br> ...I will give the order to fire.<br> He's going to do it.<br> Believe me,<br> he's really going to do it.<br> One.<br> I warn you, Colonel Saito.<br> Two.<br> Stop!<br> Colonel Saito,<br> I've seen and heard everything.<br> So has every man in the hospital.<br> There are too many witnesses.<br> You can't call it a mass escape.<br> Most of those men can't walk.<br> Is this your soldier's code?<br> Murdering unarmed men?<br> You see, Jennings, there are certain<br> advantages to being on the sick list.<br> I'll say this for the old man.<br> He's got guts.<br> "Into the valley of death<br> rode the 600."<br> How's that, sir?<br> That kind of guts.<br> Also the kind they had in 1914...<br> ...when officers fought<br> with only a swagger stick.<br> -I see what you mean.<br> -You don't see what I mean at all.<br> The kind of guts<br> that can get us all killed.<br> Excuse me, sir,<br> I'd like to go along too.<br> Arm's almost healed, sir,<br> really it is.<br> What about him?<br> He didn't order us not to escape,<br> he suggested.<br> Listen, when a man like your colonel<br> suggests something, it's an order.<br> Here we go again.<br> Colonel Saito says all officers<br> to punishment hut.<br> Tell them to go.<br> Not you.<br> Come.<br> Leave him alone!<br> They're gonna put him in the oven.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> And so say all of us<br> And so say all of us<br> And so say all of us<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> And so say all of us<br> Timber!<br> One, two, three, four.<br> No, no, no!<br> Let go!<br> You wish to see me?<br> I've been trying to see you<br> for three days.<br> It's about Colonel Nicholson.<br> He's been shut up in that hut--<br> I could have you shot.<br> Those prisoners who tried to escape,<br> they were in your charge.<br> I knew nothing about the escape.<br> It does not matter.<br> One must even respect<br> those who tried.<br> For a brief moment,<br> between escape and death...<br> ...they were soldiers again.<br> But it is insane to try and escape.<br> Two soldiers shot,<br> the third drowned.<br> To what end?<br> It was an escape from reality.<br> There is your reality.<br> This shows the position work<br> should have reached by noon today.<br> And this shows the position<br> of actual progress.<br> Because of your<br> colonel's stubbornness...<br> ...we are far behind schedule.<br> That is not all.<br> Enlisted prisoners<br> sabotaged the work.<br> Yes, I have seen it.<br> I could have them all shot.<br> Then who would build your bridge?<br> Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?<br> Perhaps the men don't work well<br> without their own officers.<br> My officers will direct them.<br> Your officers will work beside them.<br> That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.<br> As he said, it's against the rules.<br> Do not speak to me of rules.<br> This is war!<br> This is not a game of cricket.<br> He's mad, your colonel...<br> ...quite mad.<br> Sit down, please.<br> I have decided to allow you<br> one visit to your colonel.<br> Thank you.<br> Tell him that if his officers<br> will not work...<br> ...I'll be forced<br> to close the hospital...<br> ...and your patients will<br> work in their place.<br> And many will die,<br> and he will be responsible.<br> Go and speak to him.<br> You have five minutes.<br> Hey, the doc's going<br> to see the old man.<br> Sir....<br> It's Clipton, sir.<br> I brought you a few things.<br> -How are the men?<br> -Fine, sir, fine.<br> We scraped together a little meat<br> and a coconut.<br> And the officers?<br> Oh, they're not so good.<br> They're still in detention.<br> And Lieutenant Jennings....<br> Jennings is dead.<br> -What?<br> -Killed, attempting to escape.<br> Also two others,<br> Corporal Weaver and the American.<br> Jennings. Poor, brave lad.<br> I warned him, didn't l, Clipton?<br> Look, sir, we haven't much time.<br> I'm going to clean you up a little<br> while I talk.<br> I've got something to tell you.<br> I've just had a word with Saito.<br> That man is the worst commanding<br> officer I've ever come across.<br> Actually, I think he's mad. Carry on.<br> Blackmail.<br> I know, sir, but he means it.<br> I'm sure he does.<br> It's a question of face, pure and simple.<br> And he can't give in.<br> It's still blackmail.<br> Sir, you can't stand<br> much more of this.<br> Wouldn't the officers be better off<br> working than suffocating in that hole?<br> The men are doing a wonderful job.<br> They're going as slow as they dare.<br> But Saito's cut their food rations...<br> ...and if he makes<br> the sick men work....<br> Well, they're going to die.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.<br> But don't you see?<br> It's a matter of principle.<br> If we give in now,<br> there'll be no end to it. No.<br> Sir, we're lost in the jungle,<br> a thousand miles from anywhere.<br> We're under the heel of a man<br> who'll stop at nothing to get his way.<br> Principle!<br> No one will ever know or care<br> what happens to us.<br> Give in, sir. Please!<br> I'm adamant.<br> I will not have an officer<br> from my battalion working as a coolie.<br> -Time.<br> -All right.<br> Please thank those concerned.<br> Everybody in the hospital<br> contributed one piece.<br> Reynolds stole the coconut.<br> We'll be able to get you<br> something from time to time.<br> We've bribed one of your guards.<br> Goodbye, sir. And good luck.<br> Many thanks.<br> -Clipton!<br> -Yes, sir?<br> Did you say that American chap<br> was killed?<br> Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.<br> It's insane to plan escapes.<br> Three men killed, and to what end?<br> -Time!<br> -Here.<br> -Here is where we must win through.<br> -Time, time!<br> The doc just looked at us and shook<br> his head. Whatever that means.<br> Means only one thing,<br> colonel won't give in.<br> Well?<br> It's like this.<br> Colonel Nicholson<br> won't give in to force.<br> It's a question of principle.<br> As medical officer, I protest<br> to the way he's being treated.<br> It's a wonder he's still alive.<br> Should a tragedy occur,<br> it would be tantamount to murder.<br> He is responsible.<br> Not I.<br> You sick?<br> Are they both mad?<br> Or am I going mad?<br> Or is it the sun?<br> Attention!<br> Battalion, attention.<br> English prisoners.<br> Let us ask the question...<br> ...why does the bridge not progress?<br> You know why,<br> because your officers are lazy!<br> They think themselves too good<br> to share your burden.<br> This is not just.<br> Therefore, you are not happy<br> in your work.<br> Therefore, the bridge<br> does not progress.<br> But there is another cause.<br> I do not hide the truth.<br> With deep shame and regret...<br> ...I admit to you the failure...<br> ...of a member of the Japanese staff.<br> I refer to Lieutenant Miura.<br> He is a bad engineer.<br> He is unworthy of command.<br> Therefore, I have removed him<br> from his post.<br> Tomorrow we begin again.<br> I shall be in personal command.<br> Today we rest.<br> All work and no play<br> make Jack a dull boy.<br> As token of regard<br> for your efforts in the future...<br> ...I give presents to you all.<br> Let us be happy in our work.<br> Company, dismissed.<br> Battalion, dismissed.<br> Hey, take a look at this.<br> Red Cross! He's given us our--<br> Hey, he's given us<br> our own Red Cross parcels.<br> "Tomorrow we begin again."<br> Hey, Harry, look.<br> They're letting the old man out.<br> Most likely gonna give him<br> another pasting.<br> Good evening, colonel.<br> Do you mind sitting over here?<br> I am having rather a late supper.<br> English corned beef.<br> No, thank you.<br> Produce of Scotland.<br> I prefer it to sake.<br> I spent three years in London,<br> you know.<br> I studied at the London Polytechnic.<br> Cheers.<br> Sorry.<br> Later, perhaps?<br> Perhaps.<br> I was not a good artist.<br> My father disapproved.<br> He felt I belonged in the army.<br> So I changed from art<br> to engineering.<br> I must tell you, Colonel Saito.<br> I intend to make a full report<br> of your activities in this camp.<br> I do not think you quite<br> realise my position.<br> -I must carry out my orders.<br> -Oh, quite, quite.<br> My orders are to complete the bridge<br> by the 12th day of May.<br> -I have only 12 weeks more.<br> -No doubt.<br> Therefore, I am compelled<br> to use all available personnel.<br> But no officers, except in<br> an administrative capacity.<br> But officers are working<br> along the entire railway.<br> You know it. I know it.<br> I'm not responsible<br> for the actions of other officers.<br> Personally, I'm appalled.<br> Let's not get excited.<br> Will you have a cigar?<br> No. Thank you.<br> When I said all officers must work...<br> ...naturally, I never meant you,<br> the commanding officer.<br> My orders were only intended<br> for officers below--<br> None of my officers<br> will do manual labour.<br> Please! I was about to say:<br> I've been thinking the matter over<br> and have decided...<br> ...to put majors and above<br> on administrative duties...<br> ...leaving only junior officers<br> to lend a hand.<br> I'm afraid not. The Convention's<br> quite clear on that point.<br> Do you know what will happen to me<br> if the bridge is not ready in time?<br> I haven't the foggiest.<br> I'd have to kill myself.<br> What would you do if you were me?<br> I suppose if I were you...<br> ...I'd have to kill myself.<br> Cheers.<br> I warn you, colonel...<br> ...if I am to die,<br> others will die before me.<br> Do you understand that?<br> -Major Clipton did mention that.<br> -Well?<br> That won't solve your problem.<br> But I'm sure we can arrive<br> at a proper solution.<br> Please sit down.<br> Now, tell me, colonel...<br> ...do you agree that the first job<br> of an officer is command?<br> -Of course.<br> -Good.<br> Now....<br> Take this bridge of yours.<br> It's quite an enormous undertaking.<br> Frankly, I have grave doubts whether<br> your lieutenant-- What's his name?<br> -Miura.<br> -Miura.<br> --is capable of tackling<br> a job of such importance.<br> On the other hand, I have officers,<br> Reeves and Hughes for instance...<br> ...who have built bridges<br> all over India.<br> The men respect them.<br> It's essential for an officer to have<br> that respect, I'm sure you agree.<br> If he loses it,<br> he ceases to command.<br> And what happens then?<br> Demoralization and chaos.<br> A pretty poor commander I would be<br> if I allowed that to happen.<br> Perhaps you are not aware...<br> ...that the bridge is now<br> under my personal command.<br> Really? And may I ask,<br> are you satisfied with the work?<br> -I am not!<br> -You've proved my point.<br> I hate the British!<br> You are defeated<br> but you have no shame.<br> You are stubborn<br> but have no pride.<br> You endure<br> but you have no courage.<br> I hate the British!<br> Pointless, going on like this.<br> Stay there!<br> Stand down. Stand down!<br> Battalion, attention!<br> Battalion, stand at ease.<br> Please....<br> Do you know what is<br> the date today, colonel?<br> I'm afraid I've lost count.<br> It's the anniversary of<br> our great victory...<br> -...over Russia in 1905.<br> -Oh, yes.<br> Throughout East Asia<br> we are celebrating this date.<br> In honour of this occasion...<br> ...I have given your troops<br> a day of rest.<br> Many thanks.<br> I am declaring a general amnesty.<br> You and your officers may<br> return to your quarters.<br> As part of this amnesty...<br> ...it will not be necessary<br> for officers to do manual labour.<br> He's done it!<br> Somebody deserves a medal, sir.<br> How many men in your party?<br> Well, I don't really know, sir.<br> -You don't know?<br> -Sir, 12, usually.<br> But, well, one of the men took sick<br> very suddenly this morning, sir.<br> It took three or four<br> to help him to the hospital.<br> And-- He took terrible sick, sir.<br> A corporal should always know<br> how many men he has under him.<br> Oh, yes, sir.<br> Have you a nervous affliction?<br> If not, stop making those faces at once.<br> It may be funny to you,<br> but it's not military behaviour.<br> No, sir.<br> We must put a stop<br> to these demonstrations.<br> Yes, sir.<br> -I say, Reeves?<br> -Yes, sir?<br> You ever constructed a bridge<br> across a stream like the Kwai?<br> Yes, sir, half a dozen of them,<br> in Madras, Bengal....<br> If this were your bridge...<br> ...how would you get it under way?<br> Get it under way, sir?<br> Well, first of all,<br> I wouldn't build it here.<br> Oh, why not?<br> As I was trying to tell you...<br> ...the Japanese couldn't have picked<br> a worse location. There's no bottom.<br> You see those piles?<br> They're sinking.<br> Our chaps could drive those logs<br> till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.<br> Where would you build it?<br> Why, further downstream, sir.<br> Across those narrows.<br> Then we'd have solid bedrock<br> on both banks.<br> Hughes, if this were your bridge,<br> how would you use the men?<br> Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.<br> It's utter chaos, as you can see.<br> It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.<br> No teamwork.<br> Some of those parties are actually<br> working against each other.<br> Yes.<br> I tell you, gentlemen, we have<br> a problem on our hands.<br> Thanks to the Japanese,<br> we now command a rabble.<br> There's no order, no discipline.<br> -Our task is to rebuild the battalion.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Which isn't going to be easy.<br> But fortunately, we have<br> the means at hand. The bridge.<br> -The bridge, sir?<br> -The bridge.<br> We'll teach them a lesson in Western<br> efficiency that will put them to shame.<br> We'll show them what<br> the British soldier is capable of.<br> Yes. I see your point, sir.<br> I realise how difficult<br> it's going to be here...<br> ...where you can't find<br> what you need.<br> -But there's the challenge.<br> -I beg your pardon, sir.<br> You mean, you really want them<br> to build the bridge?<br> You're not usually<br> so slow on the uptake, Evans.<br> I know our men.<br> You've got to keep them occupied.<br> Fact is, if there weren't any work,<br> we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?<br> -That we would, sir.<br> -So we're lucky.<br> But it's going to be a proper bridge.<br> Here again I know the men.<br> It's essential that they<br> take pride in their job.<br> -Right, gentlemen?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Reeves, you're the key man<br> in this situation, as engineer.<br> Tell me what you want and we'll<br> organise it. Can we make a go of it?<br> -We'll do our best, sir.<br> -Fine.<br> We must draw up our plans...<br> ...then arrange a conference<br> with Saito...<br> ...and set him straight.<br> Well, I think that takes care of all<br> the procedural matters. Now....<br> Oh, yes.<br> The next point is somewhat unpleasant<br> for all concerned, I'm afraid.<br> Sorry to tell you, we feel the position<br> of the bridge was fixed hastily...<br> ...and, I have to add, incorrectly.<br> Incorrectly?<br> Unfortunately, yes.<br> Our engineer has made<br> a study of the site...<br> ...and has concluded that<br> the river bottom there is too soft.<br> Too soft?<br> Mud. All the work up to now<br> has been useless.<br> -Reeves, will you carry on?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Colonel, I've made tests.<br> Those piles of yours could be hammered<br> below water level before they'd hold.<br> That bridge would collapse<br> under the first train.<br> The pressure and soil resistance<br> figures in tons per square inch.<br> Just a moment, Reeves,<br> before you get too involved.<br> Colonel, do you suppose<br> we could have a cup of tea?<br> Then I take it we all agree<br> that if we're to avoid disaster...<br> ...we build a new bridge,<br> at the site picked by Reeves...<br> ...400 yards downstream.<br> So let's proceed to the next point.<br> I've decided to alter<br> the daily work quota of our men.<br> -Alter?<br> -Yes, I've increased it.<br> From a yard and a half<br> of earth moved to two.<br> I was sure it would meet<br> with your approval.<br> Major Hughes has all the facts.<br> Hughes, would you take over?<br> I've done a time study, Colonel Saito,<br> of the entire project.<br> As you can see, the available forces<br> have been badly distributed.<br> I would strongly urge we revise the<br> organisation of the working parties.<br> Just a moment. Colonel, it would save<br> time if we could work during dinner.<br> Would it be possible<br> to have a meal served here?<br> Of course.<br> If we--<br> -Carry on, Hughes.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> If we increase the number of squads<br> and specialise their functions...<br> ...I'm certain the total daily output<br> can be increased by 30 percent.<br> Now, Colonel Saito,<br> I have one more point....<br> Now, there's another important<br> decision that can't be postponed.<br> As most of the British<br> will work on the bridge...<br> ...only a small number will be available<br> for railway work.<br> I must ask you to lend us some of your<br> men to reinforce the railway gang...<br> ...so the final stretch of track can<br> be completed as quickly as possible.<br> I have already given the order.<br> We must fix the daily work quota<br> for your men.<br> I thought of setting it at a yard<br> and a half so as not to overtire them...<br> ...but isn't it best<br> to be the same as ours?<br> That would also create a healthy<br> competitive spirit.<br> I have already given the order.<br> -We'll try to surpass that, won't we?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> I think that completes<br> the agenda for this evening.<br> Thank you, Colonel Saito,<br> for your kind attention.<br> And are there any other questions?<br> One question.<br> Can you finish the bridge in time?<br> Frankly, the consensus of opinion<br> is that it's impossible.<br> But we'll certainly give it a go.<br> We mustn't forget we wasted a month<br> through an unfortunate disagreement...<br> ...for which I was not to blame.<br> Is there anything else?<br> No.<br> Thank you. The meeting is closed.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> I hope these Japanese appreciate<br> what we're doing for them.<br> For the moment, I'm not concerned<br> with their appreciation.<br> -Good night, Clipton.<br> -Good night, sir.<br> By the way, I meant to tell you...<br> ...there are trees in this forest<br> very similar to elm.<br> And the elm piles of London Bridge<br> lasted 600 years.<br> -Six hundred years, Reeves?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Six hundred years.<br> That would be quite something.<br> Good morning. I'm looking for an<br> American named Commander Shears.<br> -Oh, yes, down on the beach.<br> -Oh, thank you very much.<br> Kiss!<br> Too many eyes.<br> You give me powders, pills, baths,<br> injections, enemas...<br> ...when all I need is love.<br> It's true.<br> All you really need is love.<br> What makes you so sure<br> you'll get a medical discharge?<br> Because I'm a civilian<br> at heart, lover.<br> And I always follow my heart.<br> Kiss.<br> How's that, commander?<br> Don't call me commander.<br> It's unromantic.<br> You're an officer yourself.<br> How would you like it<br> if I called you Lieutenant Lover?<br> Let's be democratic.<br> Just call me "sir."<br> Yes, sir.<br> Brass ahoy.<br> He wants to see you. He's all yours.<br> -I'm going for a swim.<br> -Don't leave me.<br> -Commander Shears?<br> -Yes.<br> My name's Warden.<br> -How do you do?<br> -Sorry to intrude--<br> That's okay, major.<br> I'm used to it by now.<br> Like a martini?<br> That's very kind, but I think not.<br> -Mind if I have one?<br> -No.<br> How did you get that?<br> Where there's a hospital,<br> there's alcohol.<br> Oh, yes, of course. Jolly good.<br> Well, I'll be as brief as possible.<br> I belong to a rather rum group<br> called Force 316.<br> Our headquarters is up<br> in the Botanical Gardens.<br> -Protecting rare plants from the enemy?<br> -Not quite.<br> -Sure you won't have a martini?<br> -No, thanks.<br> We have a particular interest<br> in that railway you worked on.<br> You could give us no end<br> of valuable information.<br> Well, I'm leaving<br> for the States in a few days...<br> ...and I've already told your people<br> everything I know.<br> But you could help us<br> in a rather special sense.<br> I know it's a terrible imposition...<br> ...but I wonder if you could possibly<br> come out and see us.<br> Well, if you want to go over<br> the whole thing again.<br> Oh, that's very kind.<br> Lord Louis will be grateful.<br> -Lord who?<br> -Mountbatten.<br> -We're one of his special pigeons.<br> -Oh, I see.<br> Shall we say this evening, then?<br> About 8. I'll send a car for you.<br> This evening? Out of the question.<br> Well, tomorrow morning then?<br> About 10?<br> -Okay, 10:00.<br> -Thanks very much.<br> -Cheerio.<br> -Cheerio.<br> Good luck.<br> Thanks.<br> I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're<br> going to stand me up tonight.<br> You couldn't be more wrong.<br> General salute!<br> Present arms!<br> -May I see your pass, sir, please?<br> -Oh, yes.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Carry on, driver.<br> Major Warden's bungalow<br> is at the end of the path.<br> All right, thanks.<br> Good show, Jenkins. Good show!<br> Come along, Thomson.<br> Use your knife, man. Use your knife.<br> Good! On your feet, chaps.<br> Away to the debriefing room quickly.<br> Come on, move yourselves!<br> Move! Move quickly!<br> Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.<br> Always use your knife<br> immediately, Joyce.<br> You see, he's gained the initiative.<br> Wait a minute!<br> I'm terribly sorry, sir.<br> -You're sorry?<br> -So am l, sir.<br> -I thought you were the enemy.<br> -I'm American, if that's what you mean.<br> -That'll be all, Joyce.<br> -Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.<br> -What can I do for you, sir?<br> -I was on my way to see Major Warden.<br> I'll show you the way. He'll finish<br> his lecture any moment now.<br> -That's the end of his lecture.<br> -Thunderous ovation.<br> He believes in keeping our training<br> as close to real life as possible.<br> -Major Warden, sir?<br> -Yes?<br> Very good of you to come.<br> -I hope they took care of you.<br> -They certainly have.<br> Thank you, staff.<br> Well, come along, then.<br> Colonel Green is looking forward<br> to meeting you.<br> -Fascinating place, isn't it?<br> -Utterly charming.<br> Didn't realise it was<br> a commando school.<br> We're trying to discourage the use of<br> that word. Such a melodramatic air.<br> What do you do here?<br> Sabotage, demolition,<br> that line of country.<br> We're using P.E., plastic explosives.<br> It's wonderful stuff.<br> That pop was made<br> with a lump half this size.<br> It's twice as powerful as gelignite<br> and only half the weight. Here.<br> It's quite harmless<br> until it's detonated.<br> Thanks for telling me.<br> It's completely waterproof<br> and actually plastic.<br> See? You can do<br> what you like with it.<br> This is my place.<br> Go ahead.<br> Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.<br> -Would you care for one?<br> -No, thanks.<br> -A drink?<br> -No, thank you.<br> -Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.<br> -Very good, sir.<br> Do you read this?<br> Oh, I taught Oriental languages<br> at Cambridge before the war.<br> I never congratulated you<br> on your escape. It was a good show.<br> I was lucky. If your sea-rescue plane<br> hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.<br> No, I suppose not.<br> Would you like to see<br> where you were?<br> All right.<br> Our information's rather scanty.<br> It's mostly based on your report.<br> But we think the camp is about here.<br> Say, do your people have any idea<br> what happened to Colonel Nicholson?<br> He had guts. They were about to<br> shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.<br> If you're about to be shot<br> there's not much you can do.<br> Here is the River Kwai, and here is<br> the village where you were helped.<br> And here is the railway.<br> But then you must be fairly familiar<br> with all this area.<br> Not really, I was out of my head<br> half the time.<br> The railway starts down here<br> in Singapore. Malaya...<br> ...Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea<br> is to drive on through, into India.<br> -Where was I picked up?<br> -Oh, about here.<br> The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-<br> Rangoon section by the middle of May.<br> Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.<br> It's too far for bombers<br> to carry an adequate load.<br> We'll have to go smash it<br> on the ground.<br> -How will you get there?<br> -Parachute drop, then march.<br> With demolition equipment<br> through that jungle?<br> Our chief problem<br> is lack of firsthand knowledge.<br> You see, none of us have<br> ever been there.<br> -I don't want to discourage--<br> -It should be interesting.<br> Colonel Green's given me<br> the Kwai bridge.<br> I'm gonna take a team in<br> and blow it up.<br> Lucky you.<br> Sure you won't have tea?<br> No, thanks. I don't want to be rude,<br> but I've got a luncheon date at 2.<br> -So if there are any questions....<br> -Of course, I'm sorry.<br> Well, there is only<br> one question, actually.<br> How would you feel<br> about going back?<br> Come again?<br> I know, under the circumstances,<br> it's a bit much...<br> ...but you have a unique<br> knowledge for our purpose.<br> And we'd love to have you with us.<br> That's why you brought me here?<br> To ask me this?<br> Well, frankly, yes.<br> Major, I just got out of there.<br> My escape was a miracle.<br> Now you want me to go back?<br> Don't be ridiculous!<br> This is embarrassing--<br> I can't go back! I don't belong to you.<br> I belong to the American Navy.<br> Actually, Colonel Green has taken<br> the matter up with your people.<br> -With my people?<br> -Your Navy's turned you over to us.<br> A signal arrived yesterday morning<br> from your ClNC Pacific...<br> ...authorising your temporary transfer<br> of duty to Force 316.<br> -They can't do this to me.<br> -I'm afraid they have.<br> It was difficult to know how<br> to break it to you.<br> But they can't do this to me.<br> I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake.<br> Look. I'm not a Navy commander.<br> I'm not even an officer.<br> The whole thing's a fake. I'm just<br> an ordinary swab jockey, second class.<br> When the Houston sunk, I made<br> it ashore with a real commander.<br> Later on, we ran into<br> a Japanese patrol. He was killed.<br> I figured it was just a matter of time<br> before I was captured--<br> So you changed uniforms<br> with a dead man.<br> I thought officers would get<br> better treatment.<br> That's very sensible.<br> But at Saito's camp, the officers<br> worked along with the rest.<br> Yes, there's always the unexpected,<br> isn't there?<br> I kind of got used<br> to being a commander...<br> ...so when I arrived here<br> at the hospital...<br> ...I took a look at the enlisted men's<br> ward and then the officer's ward...<br> ...and I said to myself,<br> "Let's let it ride along for a while."<br> There were certain advantages.<br> I saw one of them on the beach.<br> Anyway, that's the whole story.<br> The point is, you can't use me.<br> You want an officer...<br> ...an American commander<br> named Shears who doesn't exist.<br> When the Navy learns the truth,<br> they'll say:<br> "Ship him home in irons<br> for impersonating an officer."<br> -Once that happens, I've got it made.<br> -Got it what?<br> -Made. I'd like that drink now.<br> -Of course.<br> I'll apply for a medical discharge.<br> I'll tell them<br> I impersonated an officer...<br> ...because I went off my rocker<br> in the jungle.<br> I'm getting worse, you know.<br> Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.<br> It's quite a clever plan.<br> It's not only clever, it's foolproof.<br> If my Navy finds out who I am...<br> ...those temporary orders won't be<br> worth the paper they're written on.<br> This is your photograph, isn't it?<br> -Where did you get this?<br> -It took a bit of doing...<br> ...because your people<br> couldn't identify you.<br> Finally your ClNC Pacific<br> sent us a copy of your service record.<br> The photograph, fingerprints.<br> Would you care to have a look?<br> No.<br> You see, we've known about<br> your actual rank for nearly a week.<br> Your Navy's in an awkward position.<br> In one sense you're a blasted hero...<br> ...for making an escape<br> from the jungle.<br> But at the same time,<br> they can't bring you home...<br> ...and give you the Navy Cross<br> for impersonating an officer.<br> I suppose that's why they were<br> so happy to hand you over to us.<br> You see?<br> Hot potato.<br> As far as your present rank<br> is concerned...<br> ...we're fairly informal<br> about those things in Force 316.<br> You'd have the simulated<br> rank of major.<br> Simulated major. That figures.<br> Well....<br> As long as I'm hooked,<br> I might as well volunteer.<br> Good show!<br> Oh, Colonel Green, sir.<br> This is Major Shears. He volunteered<br> to go and help me blow up the bridge.<br> Really?<br> Good show!<br> Jolly good show, major!<br> Get up to sick bay, Baker.<br> This foot's infected.<br> The colonel might think<br> I'm malingering.<br> I'm the medical officer, Baker.<br> Get cracking.<br> Will someone tell me why the old man<br> wants us to build a proper bridge?<br> Don't you worry about old Nick.<br> He knows what he's doing.<br> Hello, Clipton.<br> About time you paid us a visit.<br> Fine job our chaps are doing.<br> First-rate.<br> Yes. How's he behaving?<br> He's been most reasonable<br> since we took over.<br> -I wonder what he's thinking.<br> -I haven't the foggiest.<br> -Thanks, Reeves.<br> -Right, sir.<br> What do you think?<br> Quite a challenge, isn't it?<br> Sir, are you convinced that<br> building this bridge is a good idea?<br> -Are you serious?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> A good idea? Take another look.<br> You don't agree morale is high?<br> Discipline has been restored?<br> Their condition has been improved?<br> -Are they a happier lot or aren't they?<br> -Yes, sir, but--<br> They feed better<br> and they are no longer abused.<br> -That's all true.<br> -Well, then.<br> Honestly, Clipton, there are times<br> when I don't understand you at all.<br> I'll try to make myself clear, sir.<br> The fact is, what we're doing<br> could be construed as...<br> ...forgive me, sir,<br> collaboration with the enemy.<br> Perhaps even as<br> treasonable activity.<br> We're prisoners of war.<br> We haven't the right to refuse to work.<br> I understand that, sir.<br> But must we work so well?<br> Must we build them a better bridge<br> than they could have themselves?<br> If you had to operate on Saito,<br> would you do your best or let him die?<br> Would you prefer<br> we disintegrate in idleness?<br> Would you have it said that<br> our chaps can't do a proper job?<br> It's important to show these people<br> they can't break us in body or in spirit.<br> Take a good look, Clipton.<br> One day the war will be over.<br> I hope that the people who use<br> this bridge in years to come...<br> ...will remember how it was built,<br> and who built it.<br> Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.<br> British soldiers, even in captivity.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -You're a fine doctor...<br> ...but you've a lot to learn<br> about the army.<br> Hold him! Hold him!<br> Use your boot!<br> Get your boot in there, will you?<br> Good morning.<br> What on earth<br> are you people staring at?<br> Get on with your jobs!<br> Now get him with your boot!<br> I'm awfully sorry I'm late, sir.<br> Four minutes late, to be exact.<br> You were in need of medical attention?<br> -Sir?<br> -I was referring to the nurse.<br> Oh, yes, very ingenious.<br> Warden was right.<br> Sit down.<br> I asked you here to help us pick<br> the fourth member of your team.<br> -Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Chapman here wants Joyce,<br> but I have my doubts about him.<br> I think he has too much imagination<br> as distinct from cold calculation.<br> As I've told you before...<br> ...in this job, even when it's finished<br> there's always one more thing to do.<br> He's the best swimmer<br> in the school, sir.<br> I'm well aware of your evaluation.<br> The opinion I want is Shears'.<br> All right, at ease.<br> These gentlemen are thinking of<br> taking you for a hike into the jungle.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You were an accountant in Montreal?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Not really an accountant, sir.<br> That is, I didn't have my charter.<br> Exactly what did you do?<br> Well, sir, I just checked columns<br> and columns of figures...<br> ...which people had checked<br> before me...<br> ...and then other people checked them<br> after I had checked them.<br> -Sounds a frightful bore.<br> -Sir, it was a frightful bore.<br> How did you happen<br> to wind up here?<br> In '39 I came over to London<br> to enlist.<br> About two years later<br> I volunteered for this work.<br> -You volunteered!<br> -Yes, sir. See, the regular army--<br> Go ahead, you can be frank.<br> Well, the regular army reminded me<br> of my job in civilian life.<br> They don't expect you to think.<br> Think about this.<br> Are you quite sure you'd be able<br> to use it in cold blood?<br> I know how to use it, sir.<br> That's not what I meant.<br> Could you use it in cold blood?<br> Could you kill without hesitation?<br> That's a question I've often asked<br> myself, sir. It's worried me quite a bit.<br> And what was the answer?<br> I don't honestly know, sir.<br> I've tried to imagine myself....<br> I suppose I find it hard to kid myself<br> that killing isn't a crime.<br> It's an old army problem.<br> Well, I think that's all.<br> Thank you, Joyce.<br> Am I to go with the team, sir?<br> We'll let you know.<br> You see what I mean.<br> Well, at least he was honest.<br> None of us ever know the answer to<br> that question until the moment arises.<br> What's your opinion, Shears?<br> Well, sir, he's Canadian.<br> And that's in keeping with the<br> international composition of this outfit.<br> If he wants to go,<br> he can even take my place.<br> Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce,<br> he's yours.<br> I had a report from air reconnaissance<br> on that village.<br> There's sufficient clearing<br> to make your jump at last light.<br> -You've had parachute training?<br> -No, sir.<br> Blast. This is awkward.<br> Silly, it never occurred to me.<br> Well, maybe--<br> He's right.<br> Arrange some practice jumps for him.<br> I'll pop over<br> and check right away.<br> -All right, Chapman, you can run along.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Well, feel like a sniff of air?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You don't realise what a plum<br> you are for us.<br> Your knowledge of the area,<br> making friends in that village.<br> It's almost as if your whole escape<br> had been planned with us in mind.<br> By the way, here's something<br> that'll interest you. The new L pill.<br> -L pill?<br> -L for lethal. Instantaneous, painless.<br> Much better than the old ones.<br> For capture, of course.<br> You're telling me<br> not to be taken alive.<br> I wouldn't recommend it.<br> If any of you get hurt or wounded the<br> others will have to leave him behind.<br> The objective comes first<br> in our work.<br> You want my honest evaluation<br> of this team?<br> I didn't want to speak out<br> in front of them.<br> I understand, go ahead.<br> Well, Chapman will be fine.<br> Ice water in his veins.<br> Joyce is.... He'll be okay.<br> -It's Warden I don't get.<br> -Oh, why not?<br> Cambridge don and all of that.<br> It's one thing to play with explosives<br> like a kid with firecrackers--<br> He's not without experience,<br> you know.<br> When we lost Singapore, he stayed<br> behind to blow up a couple of bridges.<br> And many other installations<br> before the Japs caught him.<br> -Caught him?<br> -Yes.<br> -Fascinating story. He--<br> -Sir, it's most annoying.<br> In view of time, they don't think<br> practice jumps would be worthwhile.<br> -No?<br> -lf you make one jump...<br> ...you've only got 50 percent<br> chance of injury.<br> Two jumps, 80 percent. Three jumps,<br> you're bound to get your packet.<br> The consensus is, the most sensible<br> thing for Major Shears to do...<br> ...is to go ahead and jump<br> and hope for the best.<br> With or without parachute?<br> Oh, very good!<br> With or without!<br> He's in the trees!<br> Yai says we can't reach<br> the Kwai by the route you took.<br> There are too many Japanese patrols.<br> We'll swing north through heavy jungle.<br> -Who's gonna lead the way?<br> -Yai himself.<br> He hates the Japanese.<br> They took all his men.<br> Which means we shall have to<br> use women bearers.<br> -Women bearers.<br> -They're very capable, I'm told.<br> He says it's dangerous<br> to spend the night in the village.<br> There's an enemy post three miles away<br> so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.<br> -What about Chapman?<br> -Yai will bury him and his chute.<br> Is there something wrong?<br> I was just thinking.<br> You speak Yai's language. I don't.<br> He's gonna lead you back to the river<br> by a route I never took.<br> Will someone tell me why<br> I'm so indispensable to this outfit?<br> I know how you feel, but there's<br> always the unexpected, isn't there?<br> Tell that to Chapman.<br> Let's get cracking.<br> You're lovely.<br> Lovely.<br> Be happy in your work.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Leeches.<br> She's telling you to hold still.<br> She'll take the leeches off your back.<br> What's a nice girl like you<br> doing in a place like this?<br> I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.<br> No, that would spoil it.<br> Too much talk always spoils it.<br> What's wrong with that thing?<br> It's taken an awful beating.<br> I can't get a strong signal.<br> I'll tell you what's wrong.<br> It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.<br> Like everything else in this jungle.<br> You might as well dump it!<br> This is Radio Tokyo signing off.<br> This is your friendliest enemy<br> reminding you to take it easy...<br> ...and never volunteer for anything.<br> If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.<br> -I've got it all decoded, sir.<br> -Read it.<br> Yes, sir. "One, original<br> bridge works reported abandoned.<br> New construction downstream<br> from first site.<br> Two, enemy intends to open railway<br> with passage of special train...<br> ...Bangkok for Rangoon<br> with troops and V.l.P.<br> Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.<br> Three, synchronize demolition<br> with passage this train.<br> Four, good hunting. Have fun."<br> That's all, sir.<br> A train and a bridge!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Can we get there in time, sir?<br> Yai says we're two to three days'<br> march from the Kwai.<br> If we set a faster pace, we could<br> make it before sundown on the 12th.<br> It's worth it for the train.<br> Oh, by all means. Good hunting.<br> Good show.<br> Jolly good fun. Jolly, jolly good.<br> If you hadn't fixed the radio,<br> we wouldn't know about the train.<br> Well, there's always the unexpected,<br> isn't there?<br> Heave!<br> Heave! Heave!<br> -Half a pint, sir.<br> -Quinine.<br> Well, we'll complete this later.<br> -Clipton, we're facing a crisis.<br> -Yes, sir?<br> I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.<br> We won't finish the bridge on time.<br> We just haven't the manpower.<br> I've asked the officers to lend a hand,<br> but even that won't do it.<br> The officers are going to work?<br> I explained the situation and they<br> volunteered, but it's not enough.<br> Why not ask Saito<br> for some of his men?<br> This is our show. We must<br> make the most of our resources.<br> That's what I came to talk<br> to you about. The sick list.<br> There's not a man in this hospital<br> who doesn't belong there.<br> Don't jump to conclusions.<br> No reflection on you...<br> ...but there are always<br> a few malingerers.<br> Be honest. Keep an open mind<br> is all I ask.<br> Come along, let's see.<br> Don't move, don't move.<br> What's the matter with Haskins?<br> He's got amoebic dysentery and<br> blackwater fever. Temperature of 104.<br> Right. I see.<br> And this man?<br> Leg ulcers. I may be able to save<br> the leg if I do more cutting tonight.<br> Really want to send him<br> out to work, sir?<br> Don't talk rot, Clipton.<br> -And that man there?<br> -His arm's infected.<br> Most of their wounds<br> won't heal properly.<br> I wonder, in his case,<br> if fresh air and light duties...<br> ...might do more good<br> than being cooped up.<br> -Light duties?<br> -It's not our policy to keep a man...<br> -...just because he scratched his arm.<br> -Not our policy?<br> Well, is it?<br> A man may not be on top of his form,<br> but he can still make himself useful.<br> Trimmings and finishing jobs.<br> Stand easy, Baker.<br> Tell me, you feel up to doing<br> a little light work on the bridge?<br> -Anything you say, sir.<br> -Good show.<br> What about you? Nothing difficult.<br> -I'll try, sir.<br> -Good man.<br> Now, look here, men. It goes<br> without saying I'm proud of all of you.<br> But we're facing a crisis.<br> For those of you who feel up to it...<br> ...how about lending us a hand?<br> Fetch and carry, paint here and there?<br> What do you say?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -Good show. Come on, follow me.<br> Ten minutes.<br> Make sure they're all dead.<br> Come on, Joyce.<br> Use your knife, man,<br> or we'll be shooting each other.<br> Go that way, Joyce.<br> I could have done it. I was ready.<br> Are you hit, sir?<br> Let's go.<br> It's superficial. Maybe a chipped bone,<br> but there's nothing broken.<br> -It's my fault, sir.<br> -Oh, shut up, Joyce.<br> I can walk on it.<br> That's all that counts.<br> Yeah, but how far and how fast?<br> We won't know that<br> till I've tried it, will we?<br> What are you doing?<br> I didn't give orders for a halt.<br> We all need it.<br> We're still five hours' fast march<br> from the objective.<br> Maybe six.<br> Come on.<br> You keep walking on that foot,<br> you'll bleed to death.<br> Yeah.<br> -You're gonna leave me here.<br> -lf you stop, we stop.<br> You can't study the layout<br> of the bridge after dark.<br> You've got to get there<br> before sundown.<br> But, sir, when the job's done, who<br> knows if we can return by this route...<br> ...or whether we could find you<br> if we did?<br> If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate<br> to leave you and you know that.<br> He doesn't know it, but I do.<br> You'd leave your own mother here<br> if the rules called for it.<br> You'll go on without me.<br> That's an order.<br> You're in command now, Shears.<br> I won't obey that order.<br> You make me sick with your heroics.<br> You carry the stench of death<br> like the plague.<br> Explosives and L pills<br> go well together.<br> It's one thing or the other.<br> Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.<br> This is just a game, this war.<br> You and that Colonel Nicholson,<br> you're crazy with courage. For what?<br> How to die like a gentleman,<br> how to die by the rules...<br> ...when the only important thing<br> is how to live like a human being!<br> I'm not gonna leave you<br> here to die, Warden...<br> ...because I don't care about<br> your bridge or about your rules.<br> If we go on, we go on together.<br> Good old Yai.<br> I'm all right.<br> Come on.<br> Let's get closer.<br> Still sorry we brought you along?<br> -Feeling better?<br> -Yeah.<br> You're in command again now,<br> you know.<br> Thank you, major.<br> I can't understand it.<br> It's such a solid, well-designed job.<br> Not like the bridges<br> the enemy usually throws together.<br> Look.<br> Those poor devils down there.<br> Imagine being forced to build that<br> in the condition they must be in.<br> They've got a British officer<br> working on his knees.<br> The Japanese seem<br> to be enjoying it too.<br> If he knew we were here,<br> it might boost his morale a little.<br> If not for the train, we could<br> set a time fuse and be miles away.<br> Since we don't know<br> what time it'll cross tomorrow...<br> ...we'll have to do the job manually.<br> We'll set the charges<br> against the piles...<br> ...about three feet under the water,<br> I should think...<br> ...and run the main wire<br> downstream to the plunger.<br> The problem is where to hide it.<br> Our side of the river is quite<br> obviously used by the Japanese.<br> They'd spot it at once.<br> Look. Do you see<br> those fallen tree trunks?<br> And the grey rock just below them<br> on that little beach?<br> -Yes, sir, I see them.<br> -That's our key position.<br> It's on the wrong side of the river...<br> ...but it's the only hiding place<br> within feasible distance.<br> As soon as the bridge goes up...<br> ...whoever's there<br> will have to swim back.<br> It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.<br> Sir, I was the best swimmer<br> in my course.<br> Yeah.<br> It looks like<br> your line of country, then.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Shears, pick a spot on our side<br> of the bank where you can cover Joyce.<br> Yai will be with you<br> so you can occupy the Nips...<br> -...if they make any trouble for Joyce.<br> -Right.<br> On the theory that<br> there's always one more thing...<br> ...I'll set up the mortar here<br> to create an additional diversion.<br> Perhaps I might even take<br> a few potshots at the train.<br> All clear?<br> Any questions?<br> Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.<br> They're sure to have<br> sentries on the bridge...<br> ...so you'll have to float<br> the stuff down from upriver...<br> ...which means building a raft.<br> Yai.<br> Yai will take three women<br> to help you build the raft.<br> One will stay here with me.<br> All right, now get cracking.<br> Shears.<br> You know, if it wasn't for my ankle,<br> I'd take Joyce's assignment.<br> I know.<br> You think he'll be all right?<br> I think so. Want me to handle it?<br> I'd let you stay up here<br> with the mortar if I could.<br> I'm sorry.<br> When it's over, I hope you get<br> that medical discharge...<br> ...and not the hard way.<br> Thanks.<br> Load.<br> Beautiful.<br> Yes, beautiful.<br> A first-rate job.<br> I had no idea it would<br> turn out so well.<br> Yes.<br> A beautiful creation.<br> I've been thinking.<br> Tomorrow it will be 28 years to<br> the day that I've been in the service.<br> Twenty-eight years in peace and war.<br> I haven't been at home more<br> than 10 months in all that time.<br> Still, it's been a good life.<br> I love India.<br> I wouldn't have had it any other way.<br> But there are times...<br> ...when suddenly you realise you are<br> nearer the end than the beginning.<br> And you wonder....<br> You ask yourself...<br> ...what the sum total<br> of your life represents...<br> ...what difference your being there<br> at any time made to anything...<br> ...or if it made any difference<br> at all, really.<br> Particularly in comparison<br> with other men's careers.<br> I don't know whether that<br> kind of thinking's healthy...<br> ...but I must admit I've had<br> some thoughts on those lines...<br> ...from time to time.<br> But tonight....<br> Tonight....<br> Blast.<br> I must be off.<br> The men are preparing<br> some sort of entertainment.<br> Lovely.<br> I'm sure I speak for all of us...<br> ...when I say this has been<br> a most enjoyable evening.<br> As you know,<br> most of you move on tomorrow...<br> ...to a new camp<br> and new construction.<br> It's a pity you won't be here to see<br> the first practical use of this bridge.<br> However, you'll be glad to know<br> that the completion...<br> ...of this link in the railway...<br> ...will enable us to transport<br> the sick and disabled...<br> ...to the new camp by train.<br> Colonel Saito has kindly<br> permitted me to stay behind...<br> ...with Major Clipton<br> and the sick men...<br> ...and we'll rejoin you<br> in a few days' time.<br> Now that your work here<br> is finished...<br> ...I suppose many of you<br> feel somewhat let down.<br> That's quite understandable.<br> It's a very natural reaction.<br> But one day, in a week,<br> a month, a year...<br> ...on that day when, God willing,<br> we all return to our homes again...<br> ...you're going to feel very proud<br> of what you have achieved here...<br> ...in the face of great adversity.<br> What you have done should be...<br> ...and I think will be...<br> ...an example to all our countrymen,<br> soldier and civilian alike.<br> You have survived with honour.<br> That, and more.<br> Here in the wilderness...<br> ...you have turned defeat<br> into victory.<br> I congratulate you.<br> Well done.<br> To the king.<br> And you're in business.<br> Now, you got everything? Sten,<br> ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.<br> Yes.<br> I'll be directly across the river.<br> The professor says there's<br> always one more thing to do.<br> I can't think of what it could be.<br> Except to wish you<br> a long and happy life.<br> Thank you.<br> What's happened?<br> The river's gone down.<br> You can see the wire.<br> The charges!<br> Don't wait for the train.<br> Do it now!<br> If Saito is correct, the train<br> should be along in five or 10 minutes.<br> If you don't mind,<br> I'll watch from up on the hill.<br> Why? You'll get a better view<br> from the bridge.<br> It's hard to explain, sir.<br> I'd rather not be a part of it.<br> As you please. Honestly, sometimes<br> I don't understand you at all.<br> Well, as you once said, sir,<br> I've got a lot to learn about the army.<br> Good morning.<br> River's gone down in the night.<br> What's he doing?<br> Colonel, there's something<br> rather odd going on.<br> I think we better have a look around<br> before that train comes across.<br> He's gone mad.<br> He's leading him right to it.<br> Our own man!<br> I was right.<br> There is something going on.<br> You've got to do it, boy.<br> You've got to do it now.<br> Colonel, have you a knife? I've just<br> realised the bridge has been mined.<br> Mined?<br> Good boy!<br> Officer, sir. British officer.<br> Here to blow up the bridge.<br> -Blow up the bridge?<br> -Yes, sir. British commando orders.<br> -Blow up the bridge?<br> -Yes, sir. There's no time!<br> No, no! Help!<br> Help!<br> Kill him! Kill him!<br> Let me go, sir!<br> You don't understand, sir!<br> Kill him! Kill him!<br> Help!<br> Kill him, Joyce! Kill him!<br> You!<br> What have I done?<br> Madness.<br> I had to do it.<br> I had to do it.<br> They might have been captured alive.<br> It was the only thing to do!<br> Madness.<br>
