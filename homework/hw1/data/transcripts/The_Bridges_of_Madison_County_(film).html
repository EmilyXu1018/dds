Maybe|she didn't know what she was saying.<br> If she wanted to be cremated, why|the hell did she let Dad buy 2 plots?<br> She was very specific.<br> She wanted her ashes to be thrown off|Roseman Bridge.<br> -What?!|-Bizarre!<br> Mr. Peterson, are you sure|Mom wrote all this?<br> It was notarized and witnessed by|Mrs. Lucy Delaney.<br> -Maybe you could ask her.|-Who the hell is she?<br> I remember her, I just don't--<br> I don't care if it's legal. We're|not cremating her or throwing...<br> ...her ashes off some bridge|where we can't visit her...<br> ...because she'll be blown all over!<br> -And people driving all over her, dogs--|-We're not doing it.<br> I'm not even sure|it's Christian.<br> Maybe it's an Italian thing.|She was Italian.<br> Doesn't matter!<br> Move on.<br> We can come back to this.<br> Why don't we open the box?<br> Michael, look at these.<br> Have you ever seen these pictures?<br> It was in this envelope from 1965.<br> She's not wearing a bra.<br> That's the Holliwell Bridge.<br> -In case anyone's interested.|-Why are there 2 deeds here?<br> This is for the additional acres|he purchased in '59.<br> And this?<br> Those were bills of sale|from equipment your mother sold.<br> -This is for the original land parcel.|-Beautiful picture of her.<br> What?<br> Could you come here for a minute?<br> What?<br> Where are we going?<br> She say anything in there about me?|About leaving me anything?<br> No.<br> What's going on?<br> We were just wondering|if it might be better...<br> ...if Carolyn and I|looked at this stuff ourselves.<br> We don't want to keep you|waiting around.<br> I'll contact your office|about the legal work.<br> "I struggle to...<br> ...put it together in a way|that allows me to continue...<br> ...knowing that we're|on separate roads.<br> But then, I look through the lens|of my camera and you're there.<br> I start to write an article|and I find myself writing it to you.<br> It's clear to me now that we|have been moving towards each other...<br> ...towards those 4 days,|all of our lives."<br> I don't want to hear anymore.|Burn the damn thing.<br> I don't want to hear it.<br> Throw it away.<br> What's he saying now?<br> He just goes on about how|if Mom ever needed him...<br> ...she could reach him through the|National Geographic Magazine in D.C.<br> He was a photographer.<br> He promises not to write again.<br> And then, all it says is:<br> "I love you, Robert."<br> Robert!<br> Jesus!<br> I'll kill him.<br> That would be some trick. He's dead.|That's what this letter is...<br> ...from his attorney.<br> He left most of his things to Mom.<br> And requested....<br> What?<br> That he be cremated and his ashes|thrown off Roseman Bridge.<br> Damn him! I knew Mom|wouldn't have thought that up herself.<br> It was some damn perverted...<br> ...photographic mind influencing her.<br> When did the bastard die?<br> '82.<br> Wait a minute, that was...<br> ...3 years after Daddy....|Do you think...?<br> I don't know!|I'm completely in the dark.<br> That's what I get for moving away.<br> We were kids when this happened.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Do you think that she...<br> ...had sex with him?<br> Must be nice inside your head|with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.<br> Don't talk to me like that.|She was my mother!<br> Now I find that she was....|She was a....<br> A what?|Don't say that!<br> What am I supposed to think?<br> I can't believe she never told me.<br> We spoke at least once a week.|How could she do that?<br> When did she meet him?|Did Dad know?<br> Is there anything else in that envelope?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> You read it.<br> You read it.<br> "January, 1987.<br> Dear Carolyn:<br> I hope you read this with Michael.<br> I'm sure he wouldn't be able|to read it by himself...<br> ...and he'll need help|understanding all this.<br> First and most of all...<br> ...I love you both very much.<br> And although I feel fine,|I thought I'd put my affairs...<br> ...excuse that word, in order."<br> I can't believe she's making jokes.<br> "After going through|the safe deposit box...<br> ...I'm sure you'll find your way|to this letter.<br> It's hard to write this|to my own children.<br> I could let this die|with the rest of me, I suppose.<br> But as one gets older...<br> ...one's fears subside.<br> What becomes more and more important...<br> ...is to be known.<br> Known for all that you were|during this brief stay.<br> How sad it seems to leave this earth...<br> ...without those you love the most|ever really knowing who you were.<br> It's easy for a mother to love|her children, no matter what.<br> I don't know|if it's as simple for children.<br> You're all so busy being angry|at us for raising you wrong.<br> His name was Robert Kincaid.<br> He was a photographer|and he was here in 1965...<br> ...shooting a National Geographic|article...<br> ...on the covered bridges|of Madison County.<br> Remember when we got that issue,|when we got the subscription...<br> ...how we felt like celebrities?"<br> That's Roseman Bridge.<br> That must be Robert Kincaid.<br> And that's Mom's medallion.<br> "I don't want you to be angry with him.<br> I hope after you know the story,|you think well of him, even grateful."<br> -Grateful?|-"It's all there in the 3 notebooks."<br> "It was the week|of the Illinois State Fair.<br> The two of you were going|with Dad to exhibit...<br> ...Carolyn's prize steer.<br> It was the Sunday night you left.|I know it sounds awful...."<br> But I couldn't wait for you to leave.<br> You were going to be gone until Friday.<br> Just 4 days.<br> Richard!

I can't sleep|without you next to me anymore.<br> It's only 4 days.<br> Oh, God, where have you been?<br> You missed them.|They already left.<br> Why do you love me so much?|I don't like you.<br> Get down.<br> You like that song?<br> It's just you and me.<br> Just you and me.<br> Hi.<br> I get the distinct feeling|that I'm lost.<br> You supposed to be in Iowa?<br> Then you're not that lost.<br> I'm looking for a bridge.<br> One of those covered bridges|in this neighborhood.<br> Roseman Bridge?<br> That's it.<br> You're pretty close.|It's only about 2 miles from here.<br> Which way?<br> You go that way and come to Cutter's|and turn left.<br> To Cutters?<br> Cutter's a farm.|Small house, close to the road.<br> Big, mean yellow dog.<br> Mean yellow dog. Okay.<br> Then you go along that road|until you come to a fork.<br> It's only....|Less than half a mile.<br> And then where, after the fork?<br> The right.<br> And then you....<br> No, no.

It's quiet|and the people are real nice."<br> And all that's true.|Mostly.<br> It is quiet.<br> And the people are nice.<br> In certain ways.<br> We all help each other out.<br> If someone gets sick or hurt,|all the neighbors come in.<br> They pick the corn, harvest the oats|or whatever needs to be done.<br> In town, you can leave your car|unlocked, and let the kids run around.<br> Don't worry about them.<br> There are a lot of nice...<br> ...things about the people here.<br> And I respect them for those qualities.<br> But....<br> But?<br> It's not...<br> ...what I dreamed of...<br> ...as a girl.<br> I scribbled something down|the other day.<br> I often do that|when I'm out on the road.<br> Kind of goes like this:<br> "The old dreams...<br> ...were good dreams.<br> They didn't work out,|but I'm glad I had them."<br> I don't know what it means.|I thought I might use it someday.<br> Anyway, I think I know how you feel.<br> Would you like to stay for dinner?<br> There's not much in town.<br> And you'd have to eat alone.<br> So would I.<br> Yeah, I'd like that.<br> I don't get a home-cooked meal too often|out on the road.<br> Okay.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> Do you mind|if I put some film in the fridge?<br> -No, go ahead.|-This heat out here isn't too forgiving.<br> Anything I can do to help?<br> -To help?
