Not this song, babies.<br> Zanfield's bought it for his new revue.<br> And the Mahoney Sisters are coming<br> from the West to put it over for me.<br> Listen, Eddie, you're not gonna waste<br> a swell number like that...<br> ...on a smalltime sister act, are you?<br> Nix cracking, Rosie.<br> Half of that sister team is going to be<br> the future Mrs. Eddie Kearns.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute, Eddie.<br> If you wanna be made overnight,<br> just give us a crack at that number.<br> Oh, no. Oh, no.<br> No, no. Positively not.<br> I've gotta get back to the hotel.<br> The girls are waiting for me.<br> Oh, but listen,<br> if you want a song...<br> ...see Georgie Cohan.<br> He writes good music too.<br> How about it, Jimmy?<br> Oh, I'll take that, thank you.<br> Gee, this is elegant, ain't it?<br> Tell you better when<br> I get a peek at the beds.<br> Quiet. I told you to pack<br> that cooking outfit in the trunk.<br> Yeah? Well, I'm taking no chances.<br> If we can't pay our bill and the hotel<br> holds the trunks, we still eat.<br> And, baby, when you don't eat,<br> you lose a lot of calories.<br> Calories? What are they?<br> Oh, acrobats, you big sap.<br> - Well, I never got fat on your cooking.<br> - No?<br> You never got that complexion<br> from the Greeks.<br> - Don't talk to me like...<br> - lxnay, ixnay.<br> - Leave us plenty of towels too.<br> - I did.<br> And I counted them.<br> How high can you count?<br> Well, everything's okay.<br> Will there be anything else?<br> Yeah, food.<br> I think he may stall for a tip.

And why?<br> Just to save money enough<br> to get to New York and show our act.<br> Oh, honey.<br> With your looks and my ability...<br> I wouldn't steer you wrong.<br> Now don't worry.<br> You see that electric sign<br> of the fellow in BVDs?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well, right there...<br> ...they're gonna have<br> the Mahoney Sisters.<br> - In BVDs?<br> - Yes, in BVD...<br> Baby, they were plenty smart<br> when they made you beautiful.<br> Come on, let's get cleaned up<br> before Eddie gets here.<br> I'll run a tub for you.<br> The Mahoney Sisters in BVDs.<br> Hey, what are you singing?<br> The bubble song from Lux.<br> Will you join me?<br> No use of us both getting wet.<br> Will you wash mine?<br> I might as well. You never wash<br> anything but your neck.<br> I not only wash them.<br> I gotta pick them up.<br> Oh, Hank, I didn't think.<br> Oh, you never do.<br> Oh, don't strain yourself.<br> I'll get them.<br> Oh, boy, this is going to be good.<br> Oh, I'll go.<br> Can you imagine my embarrassment?<br> Uncle Jed!<br> Hello, honey. How are you?<br> - Fine, and you?<br> - Great.<br> - Gee, I'm glad to see you, Hank.<br> - Oh, Queenie, hurry up. It's Uncle Jed!<br> Uncle Jed?<br> I'll be right out.<br> What a break for you.<br> - I'll be with you in just a minute.<br> - All right, honey, but hurry.<br> What do you know, Uncle Jed?<br> I've got you booked for 30 weeks<br> over at the Manley Time.<br> Nothing doing.<br> We're in New York to stay.<br> Say, listen, girls...<br> ...you know, I know this town better<br> than you do. And there are more sisters...<br> ...doing their acts over the lunch counters<br> in New York than over the...<br> Than in the theaters.<br> You're just a crapehanger.<br> Maybe, but let me tell you...<br> ...tell you, tell you, tell you...<br> What's the name of that record<br> you're playing?<br> Say, listen, girls...<br> Yeah?<br> Well, what is it?<br> I love both you girls,<br> and I want to see you get along.<br> Sure, Uncle Jed, we know that.<br> But we aren't leaving this town till we<br> get a flash at Babe Ruth and Grant's Tomb.<br> - Oh, will you get that, Uncle Jed?<br> - You bet.<br> Oh, girls, your break...

Oh, gee!<br> That's my Queenie!<br> - Queenie? You don't mean to tell me it's...<br> - Sure.<br> Queenie, all grown up and everything.<br> Ain't she? That sisterly kiss<br> won't be so hard to take now.<br> I'll say it won't.<br> - Take it big.<br> - I did.<br> You were a funny-looking thing<br> the first time I saw you...<br> ...with those gangly legs and freckles.<br> But you certainly turned out to be<br> a beautiful girl.<br> Well, I'll go get some clothes on.<br> I'm just crazy about her, Eddie.<br> She's so young and beautiful.<br> Of course she is.<br> Well, Hank, now that you're here,<br> when are we going to get married?<br> Oh, not till we've put this act over.<br> I'm gonna give Queenie a break.<br> Always doing something<br> for somebody else.<br> No wonder I love you.<br> - I kind of got a weakness for you too.<br> - Yeah?<br> Mrs. Eddie Kearns?<br> Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?<br> Swell, Eddie.<br> Yeah, and you can feature<br> that anytime in the electric lights.<br> - Gee, still the same sweet kid, ain't you?<br> - Why, certainly.<br> Hank, did you pack my new dress<br> in the trunk?<br> I'll get it for you in a minute.<br> Come here, Queenie.<br> - Gee, I can't get over how she's changed.<br> - Well, you sure look elegant, Eddie.<br> - Doesn't he, Hank?<br> - He's an eyeful.<br> Three carats.<br> Platinum.<br> And here's the payoff.<br> Look, but don't laugh.<br> Gold garters!<br> Oh, Eddie, I always knew<br> you'd make good.<br> Yeah, and I ain't forgetting that you're the<br> little girl that made me come to New York.<br> Remember when I wanted to quit<br> and give the whole thing up...<br> ...and you made me stick it out?<br> Well, now I'm gonna do<br> something for you.<br> Zanfield's bought my new song,<br> "The Broadway Melody."<br> And he's naming his revue after it.<br> - But I've already spoken to him about you.<br> - You think we've got a chance?<br> Chance? Don't be silly.<br> One word from me, and you're in.<br> - Queenie, ain't that great?<br> - Sure, if it's true.<br> True? You don't know<br> how I stand with Zanfield.<br> - Lf we're in, what do we do?<br> - When do we start?<br> And how much do we get?<br> You're gonna sing<br> my "Broadway Melody" with me.<br> The Mahoney Sisters and Eddie Kearns.<br> Yeah, Eddie Kearns<br> and the Mahoney Sisters.<br> Well, how does it go?<br> How's it go? Now, listen, I sing a verse,<br> and you come in on the chorus.<br> Then we do another chorus,<br> and then go into a little dance.<br> - Give us an idea of the dance.<br> - I'll give you an idea.<br> - Good?<br> - Swell, Eddie, do it again.<br> Let's move back this table, kids.<br> We'll do our dance.<br> All ready, girls?<br> Come on, now, let's go.<br> There you are.<br> Queenie, why don't you look at my feet?<br> Look at her.<br> Attagirl!<br> You like that?<br> Don't do that.<br> Don't do that!<br> Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!<br> - What's the matter with the left leg?<br> - I've got a headache.<br> Go on, sit down,<br> take a load off your mind.<br> - Don't talk to me like that. I don't feel well.<br> - Listen, don't answer me back, understand?<br> Come here.<br> There's Eddie. Hello, hey!<br> Your rhythm is all wrong.<br> Nothing like I showed you.<br> All right, now watch.<br> - Hello, Eddie.<br> - Hello, how are you?<br> We had a tough time getting in!<br> When do we show the act?<br> In a few minutes.<br> I haven't had a chance<br> to talk to Zanfield yet.<br> - It's okay, ain't it?<br> - We're in?<br> Sure, it's in the bank.<br> - Whatever I say goes.<br> - Hey, Kearns!<br> Yes, sir?<br> We don't wanna take all afternoon<br> to set one dance.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Maybe we'd better get undressed.<br> Come on.<br> All right, Sam, let it go.<br> - Oh, George.<br> - Wait a minute, hold it there. Hold it, Sam.<br> The sets are all ready<br> for your okay, Mr. Zanfield.<br> That's just an idea<br> of what it's gonna be.<br> I can see that. It's just an idea.<br> Yes, sir. Yes, sir.<br> But don't worry, I'll fix it.<br> - Okay on those sets.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Remind me to see that rehearsal<br> in the morning. Make a note of that.<br> I'm having lunch at the Knickerbocker.<br> Oh, Mr. Zanfield, this material, I couldn't<br> get it in the gold design, only in the silver.<br> - Isn't it lovely?<br> - It's fine. Get it in the gold.<br> - Remember, I want that in the gold.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Oh, Mr. Zanfield, pardon me, will you take<br> a look at the Mahoney Sisters right now?<br> - The Maloney Sisters?<br> - No, the Mahoney Sisters.<br> - Who are they? I never heard of them.<br> - It's the sister act I told you about.<br> - Where are they?<br> - Right over there, across stage.<br> All right, wheel them in.<br> - Tell George I'll take a look at the act.<br> - Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.<br> Well, kids, you all set?<br> Got your music?<br> Well, go over there and tell him<br> what you want.<br> The Baloney Sisters.<br> Give us the introduction pickup<br> and some choruses. And swell to the finish.<br> - But you follow us.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Sam, looks like some carnival<br> lost a good act.<br> I'm gonna lay that dame<br> like a roll of linoleum.<br> - Hank, you can't pull that around here.<br> - Hank, don't start anything now.<br> - Get her in the dressing room.<br> - Sure. Now, come on. Get together.<br> - All set now?<br> - Oh, wait a minute.<br> - Don't mind if I put this down?<br> - No, ma'am.<br> I'll vamp till ready, and don't forget:<br> We do things intimately.<br> - All set.<br> - All set, fine. Babies, smack it over big.<br> You ain't got nothing to worry about.<br> You're as good as in now.<br> - I'll go and see how the boss likes it.<br> - All right.<br> Well, all right, shoot.<br> - Play it, will you?<br> - Something wrong with the piano.<br> - Do I have to come over and play it for you?<br> - Okay, go ahead.<br> What's the matter with them?<br> There's something wrong with the piano.<br> - Say, are you trying to crab our act?<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - Well, will you play it then, hot or cold?<br> - Well, go ahead then.<br> All right. All right, girls.<br> Mr. Zanfield's seen enough.<br> He'll let you know. Come in next Friday.<br> - But he ain't seen the finish yet.<br> - Yes. I know, all right. Line up, girls.<br> Oh, Mr. Zanfield, please give them a break.<br> You haven't seen their act.<br> I saw enough.<br> I can use the blond,<br> but that little cluck is out.<br> But don't you know it's tough<br> to put comedy over on a bare stage?<br> They'll be all right at the performance.<br> Give them another chance.<br> I know, Eddie.<br> Gee, kid, that's a tough break. Even if the<br> act is a louse, he should've seen the finish.<br> It ain't a louse. It's a good act.<br> We stopped the show<br> every performance we did for Jake Wells.<br> Yeah, the one I saw would stop a tank.<br> Say, you've been asking for trouble,<br> and now you're gonna get it.<br> You great big peroxide-headed dizzy blond,<br> you! What do you think of this act?<br> Hey, come here! Come here, girls!<br> Come here!<br> Let me at her, will you?<br> Let me at her!<br> Next time I'll give you a facial<br> instead of a scalp treatment.<br> - Yeah, and I'll fix you, you little peanut.<br> - Let go of me!<br> - Oh, boy, I'll sock her...<br> - Stop it, Hank, you're crabbing everything.<br> Go get your clothes on.<br> I'll fix everything.<br> The big blond baboon! Why'd she pick<br> on me? I didn't start any fight with her.<br> - Where's my music?<br> - Here's your music.<br> - Well, where's my bag?<br> - Now, be quiet. Be quiet, Hank!<br> Get in there. Straighten it out.<br> Let's get smart, Sam. Where are you?<br> Don't let them throw you<br> up in the air.<br> I'm not gonna waste all day at it.<br> Give me a pickup and two choruses.<br> And let me tell you dames something:<br> If I get ahold of her, I'll rip her wide open.<br> Flo, what was the trouble about?<br> - I was beside the piano, not doing a thing...<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - I can't stand for quarreling.<br> - I didn't start it.<br> Never mind who started it. Now<br> run along and be a good little girl.<br> - Oh, all right.<br> - And remember, no more quarreling.<br> - Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.<br> - Well?<br> I heard what you said about me.<br> Please, couldn't you use the both of us<br> at the same salary?<br> I might.<br> I think I can slip her in somewhere.<br> - Oh, thank you, Mr. Zanfield!<br> - All right.<br> My sister is the business manager<br> of the act.<br> You won't let on that it ain't<br> the both of us you want, will you?<br> Of course not.<br> - You send her over, and I'll talk to her.<br> - Oh, thank you!<br> All right.<br> Oh, Hank!<br> He can take his old show and put it<br> where it'll do him the most good!<br> Don't act like that, Hank.<br> He didn't see your act, that's all.<br> - He's a very busy man.<br> - Oh, he's busy?<br> Well, so am I busy,<br> with 30 weeks waiting for me.<br> - Now, don't get so excited over nothing.<br> - Hank, quick!<br> Mr. Zanfield wants to see you.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - On the level?<br> - Maybe we're in after all.<br> - Sure!<br> Let me handle this. I can always take care<br> of these things better with nobody around.<br> I'll talk to him.<br> All right, girls, we'll take this right from<br> the beginning. Okay, Sam, let it go.<br> I heard what you said to Zanny.<br> - You won't let on to Hank, will you, Eddie?<br> - Of course not.<br> Gee, that was wonderful of you,<br> Queenie.<br> I could kiss you for that.<br> You mustn't do that, Eddie.<br> I guess I shouldn't.<br> I never realized you were...<br> Gee, you're the sweetest little girl<br> I ever knew.<br> You mean next to Hank.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> You know, Hank's been everything<br> in the world to me.<br> She's looked after me and worked for me,<br> and fought for me, protected me.<br> I could never repay her<br> for all her love and care.<br> Of course you love her, Queenie.<br> And you're gonna be everything<br> that she wants you to be.<br> And I don't blame her for loving you.<br> Gee, but you're a cute kid.<br> And she loves you, Eddie.<br> I guess you and me are about all<br> she ever thinks of.<br> Oh, I never wanna hurt her, Eddie.<br> And I want her to be happy with you.<br> Why, Queenie, I'd rather lose my pipes<br> so I couldn't sing...<br> ...and go lame so I couldn't dance<br> than to hurt Hank.<br> - Sure you would. So would I.<br> - Can you imagine?<br> - We're in! Rehearsal in the morning!<br> - That's great!<br> - I knew you'd put it over, Hank!<br> - Oh, just leave it to me!<br> I ain't booked acts for 10 years<br> and not know how to handle them!<br> - You bet you haven't!<br> - You're both swell kids!<br> - And plenty smart!<br> - And how!<br> - Gee, rehearsal in the morning! Ain't it great?<br> - Yeah!<br> Come on.<br> I got a lot of washing and ironing to do.<br> - You have?<br> - I want you to look your best, honey.<br> But tell me, how did you put it over?<br> What did you say to him?<br> I said to him, "Now, you listen here,<br> Mr. Zanfield, this is a sister team.<br> And we splits up for nobody!"<br> And with that,<br> he smiled as nice as you please...<br> ...and said, "That's all right, Miss Maloney."<br> Can you imagine calling me Maloney?<br> And everybody knows our name's Mahoney.<br> - Yeah, can you imagine that?<br> - Imagine that.<br> "Maloney"!<br> Hey, come on and get those<br> clothes on, will you?<br> - Hurry up!<br> - Well, are we all set?<br> Yes, sir, everything ready to go<br> when you say the word.<br> All right.<br> - Are you safe up there, Audrey?<br> - Okay.<br> Yes, that's perfectly safe.<br> - You get the orchestra in the pit.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Oh, Hagerty.<br> - Yes?<br> - That looks very good.<br> - I think it'll be very effective.<br> - So do I.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Can you imagine? Putting on all this makeup<br> for just one show a day?<br> Oh, dear! I'm just shaky all over.<br> Queenie, will you stop?<br> You're getting me nervous now.<br> It ain't a bit different<br> than it was in Reading, PA.<br> And we're going over just as big.<br> - Oh, Hank, do you think so?<br> - Why, it's cream in the can, baby.<br> - Are you decent, girls?<br> - Yeah, come in.<br> Oh, Hank, get a load of this.<br> "Big mammoth appearance<br> of the Mahoney Sisters on Broadway.<br> Zanfield saw them once,<br> and they were in.<br> With appreciation and regards<br> to our agent, Uncle Jed."<br> - Is that a pippin or not?<br> - You care for that?<br> - Do I?<br> - Hank, will you get Eddie out of here?<br> I'm nervous!<br> What's eating her?<br> Eddie, you gotta run along now.<br> We're nervous.<br> I get you.<br> Now, Queenie, don't be nervous.<br> - Remember, this is your big opportunity.<br> - Will you get out of here?<br> - Beat it, Eddie, will you?<br> - Now, don't forget, a lot depends on this.<br> - Oh, get out!<br> - Get out!<br> Stop, stop! Girls, girls!<br> - Be careful of my hats!<br> - We gotta get down on the stage!<br> I don't care!<br> I won't allow you to ruin them.<br> I told you they were<br> too high and too wide.<br> Well, big woman, I design<br> the costumes for the show...<br> ...not the doors for the theater.<br> I know that. If you had,<br> they'd have been done in lavender.<br> Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield, but the orchestra's<br> killing my "Broadway Melody" number.<br> - Too much brass. They can't hear me.<br> - Kearns, tell them to keep it down.<br> Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.<br> - All right, boys, I think we can go.<br> - Yes, sir!<br> Hey, you!<br> When you get through with that noise,<br> try and play my number.<br> Cut out the brass,<br> and keep it very piano.<br> Are you back again?<br> Yes, and I'm telling you<br> how I want my music played.<br> I've conducted opera.<br> What do you know about music?<br> - Nothing. I only wrote it, that's all.<br> - Then you have the best of me.<br> You don't have to listen.<br> I'll tell Zanny what a sap he was<br> for buying it.<br> Maybe he'll get you<br> to write the music for the show.<br> If I couldn't do better than this...<br> If you could,<br> you wouldn't be waving a stick!<br> Electrician!<br> A little more this way with that spotlight.<br> What are you trying to do,<br> ruin my profile?<br> Your profile was ruined the day<br> you were born.<br> That's a smart crack.<br> Hit me with it and keep it here.<br> Hey, put that spotlight<br> over here on this girl!<br> - He wants it over there.<br> - But it goes over here.<br> That spotlight goes here.<br> I can't sing without a spotlight.<br> Say, you couldn't sing<br> if you had a searchlight.<br> - Did you get everything you wanted?<br> - Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield.<br> Would you okay this bill<br> for Miss William's second act?<br> What's the idea? Two grand for a coat worn<br> for less than three minutes? I won't pay it!<br> But you said ermine.<br> You'll giggle yourself<br> right out of here one day.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - It's a gorgeous garment, isn't it?<br> - Isn't it gorgeous?<br> In fact, it's the gorgeous-est thing<br> I have ever seen. You sweet little cutie!<br> - There you are.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Zanfield.<br> - Come here, Unconscious.<br> - Hello, boys.<br> Say, Joe LeBlanc saw the rehearsal,<br> and he says there's a fortune in the show.<br> - Yes, sir!<br> - We ought to know. We put it in.<br> - You think it's a good show then, Zanny?<br> - It's just an oil well.<br> - Let's see your gusher.<br> - Looks like a mine to me.<br> From all the gold-diggers<br> you got in the troupe.<br> Any old time one of them can pry a nugget<br> off of his ledge, they're going some!<br> Come on, Unconscious, put the load down.<br> Overture, girls.<br> This is the "Broadway Melody" number.<br> Get out of here and hurry up.<br> Come on. Come on. Get out of here.<br> Come on. Go on, get out.<br> Oh, there's the overture.<br> Oh, where's my hat?<br> Where's my hat?<br> Where's my hat?<br> Oh, where's my hat?!<br> - Over there!<br> - Over where?<br> - On the floor, under the clothes.<br> - Oh, yes. The clothes carton.<br> Why didn't you say so in the first place?<br> And make it snappy.<br> - Are you ready?<br> - Yes.<br> Now, honey, remember:<br> The dress rehearsal is tougher...<br> ...than a first-night performance.<br> So don't be nervous.<br> - I'm not nervous.<br> - Neither am I.<br> No, it's over that shoulder.<br> That's the idea.<br> More. With those beads.<br> That's it. That's better.<br> That's the idea. In this...<br> All right! Out of the way.<br> Clear the way.<br> Elgin, call a doctor.<br> Elgin! Call a doctor! Elgin!<br> What are we gonna do?<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> Hold it!<br> That number's too slow.<br> Cut out the Maloney Sisters.<br> - Cut out the whole first chorus?<br> - Yes.<br> Why, has he cut us out altogether?<br> Ain't it awful, the way<br> they cut out these big stars?<br> I'll get to you in a minute.<br> Listen here, Mr. Zanfield,<br> you can't cut us out like that.<br> We've got equity contract.<br> Kearns, go into the dance<br> on the first chorus and end it there.<br> One more cut for you, dearie,<br> and you'll be holding a spear.<br> And one more crack from you, bimbo,<br> and you'll be holding a lily.<br> Listen to me, Mr. Zanfield, we...<br> Keep quiet. Will you cut it out<br> and give me a chance to do my number?<br> But he cut us out of the whole show.<br> He can't do that.<br> Did you hear that, Mr. Zanfield?<br> They're trying to drown me out.<br> - Are you trying to drown him out?<br> - We're doing our best.<br> Mr. Zanfield, would you come backstage<br> a moment? It's very important.<br> - All right.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What's the trouble now?<br> The other dame flopped.<br> How about this one?<br> No, sir.<br> - Terrible.<br> - What are we gonna do about her?<br> There he is now.<br> I'm gonna give that guy an earful.<br> Where's that blond McGinty sister?<br> Use her.<br> Mahoney's the name,<br> and let me tell you something...<br> Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.<br> I'll get her up there.<br> You may not know it, but we've<br> played some of the very best...<br> Listen, we want you<br> on the prow of that boat.<br> Come on now.<br> Let's get your clothes off.<br> But I don't want<br> to take my clothes off.<br> No, that'll be all right.<br> But listen to me. I've never taken<br> my clothes off in my life.<br> I know all about that. Come on.<br> - How've you got this thing hooked?<br> - I don't know.<br> Over here.<br> Say, do I get that spot, or don't I?<br> That's tough. I missed him.<br> - How's everything going, Zanny?<br> - Very smoothly. Very, very smoothly.<br> - That's fine.<br> - Great.<br> Sit down with us.<br> Oh, Jules. Jules.<br> I like that number.<br> That's a very good arrangement.<br> How do you do it?<br> Where do you pick them?<br> I guess it's just a gift.<br> By the way, what's the name<br> of that little beauty on the boat?<br> Ask her.<br> It'll give you something to do.<br> - That's a great idea.<br> - Come on, Unconscious.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - You were great, Mahoney.<br> - I'll say you were.<br> - You'll be in a Rolls-Royce by Thursday.<br> - Go on.<br> What a flock of Johns will<br> be waiting at that stage door!<br> - Go on. You can't kid me.<br> - I'm not kidding you.<br> I may be there myself.<br> - Oh, Queenie.<br> - Go in and change.<br> Hank, did you see Queenie?<br> What's the matter, Hank?<br> Aren't you happy?<br> Wasn't Queenie great?<br> Aren't you proud of her?<br> Of course, Eddie.<br> I'm glad to see her make good.<br> Oh, but gee, we ain't never had<br> to get by on our legs before.<br> Oh, that don't mean nothing, Hank.<br> Those guys are not gonna pay 10 bucks<br> to look at your face.<br> This is Broadway.<br> Yeah. Broad's way.<br> Now, run along and change.<br> I'll get Queenie.<br> Attagirl.<br> Queenie, everybody is raving about you.<br> - Gee, but you're a beautiful kid.<br> - I'm glad you like me, Eddie.<br> Like you? Oh, boy. When I got a peek<br> at you up there on that boat...<br> - Isn't this the beautiful lady of the boat?<br> - Yes.<br> - Kearns. They're waiting for you.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - I'm Jock Warriner.<br> - How do you do?<br> - And this is Stew and Bay.<br> - How do you do?<br> I bet them that the most beautiful girl<br> in New York will have supper with us.<br> - You've got to help me win that bet.<br> - What have I got to do with that?<br> - Well, you see, you're the girl.<br> - Oh, no, I'm not.<br> - I guess we win that bet, Jock.<br> - Now, wait a minute. Not yet.<br> - Hey, Unconscious, where you going?<br> - I'm gonna get on that boat.<br> Come here, sap. You can't get on that.<br> That's not a real boat.<br> Please.<br> Please, won't you change your mind?<br> - I'm sorry, but really, I can't.<br> - Oh, come on. Please do.<br> - No. Not tonight.<br> - No?<br> - Come on. Slip us the 50.<br> - Wait a minute. I haven't lost yet.<br> Oh, yeah...?<br> Come here, Unconscious, come here.<br> You can't go up there, you'll get kicked out.<br> It's a ladies' dressing room.<br> - Let's go on the boat.<br> - On the boat. Get out of here.<br> Don't worry, Hank.<br> They only cut one number.<br> We got a couple of others.<br> "Zanny saw them once,<br> and they were in."<br> Zanny saw me once, and I was out.<br> Not altogether. And what of it?<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Do you think that's all I'll get to do,<br> go on without any clothes on?<br> Not if I can help it.<br> But you don't need to worry.<br> You got a lot more on<br> when you ain't got anything...<br> ...than most of the dames<br> I've seen around here.<br> Well, I guess I'll go get<br> undressed again.<br> Come in.<br> - Hello, kids. Are you all ready?<br> - Yep. All ready.<br> Well, listen. Zanny is giving<br> a big party at his apartment tonight.<br> - Let's go over.<br> - Gee, that's great. Did he invite us?<br> Not exactly, but what's the difference?<br> Ain't I the star of this troupe?<br> That guy threw me out<br> of your song tonight.<br> I ain't gonna give him a chance<br> to throw me out of a window.<br> Let's get a bowl of chop suey,<br> and we'll rewrite the show.<br> If it'll write me back in the show,<br> I'd go for a bowl of anything.<br> Well, you can get most anything<br> out of a bowl of chop suey.<br> Oh, cutie!<br> Come on, Queenie.<br> You two run along.<br> I've got some things to do,<br> and I'll join you later.<br> Why, what's the matter?<br> Well, I've...<br> I've got an awful headache.<br> I'm sorry, honey.<br> We'll go straight home if you'd rather.<br> Oh, no, Hank. You two run along.<br> You'll have a lot of fun, anyway.<br> Come on, Queenie.<br> We don't wanna go without you.<br> Get your hat. You'll feel better<br> when you get out of here.<br> Oh, sure, honey, come on.<br> I can't go.<br> - You got a date with somebody, huh?<br> - Of course not.<br> - Who, Queenie? You're crazy.<br> - Crazy, am I?<br> You've got a date<br> with that Jock Warriner, I'll bet.<br> - Well, and what if I have?<br> - Well, I don't like it.<br> Oh, you can't go out with that bird.<br> I'll have to show you<br> whether I can or not.<br> Come in.<br> - Hello.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> Well, here I am again.<br> You can't get rid of me.<br> - I'll be right with you, Mr. Warriner.<br> - All right.<br> Maybe you had better wait for me<br> just a few minutes down on the stage.<br> - Shall I wait at the stage door?<br> - Please.<br> - Now, don't be long.<br> - No, I won't.<br> - Hurry.<br> - I will.<br> Now, Queenie, don't act this way.<br> He ain't the right kind of a guy<br> for you to go out with.<br> What difference does it make<br> what kind of a guy he is?<br> I'm going out with him because I...<br> Well, because I want to.<br> - Oh, no, you're not.<br> - Oh, yes, I am.<br> You're not! You're gonna listen to me.<br> I can take care of myself. And you<br> can both mind your own business.<br> Why don't you mind your sister?<br> She knows best.<br> You keep out of this.<br> I've got my own life to live,<br> and I'm gonna live it.<br> I'm not gonna be the third wheel<br> to anybody's bicycle!<br> Oh, Queenie!<br> Oh, Eddie, what'll we do?<br> Why, she's never gone<br> against my advice before.<br> Don't worry, Hank. She's only a kid.<br> She'll snap out of it.<br> I guess the bright lights<br> got under her skin.<br> Come on, let's go<br> and get a bowl of chili.<br> Queenie!<br> - Oh, you didn't go. You didn't go!<br> - I couldn't, Hank.<br> Oh, dear! I'm so glad.<br> Oh, they're elegant.<br> - Yeah. Where do I park them?<br> - Wait a minute. Put them over there.<br> Good morning, beautiful lady.<br> Oh, you frightened me.<br> Good morning.<br> - Oh, they're elegant. Thanks.<br> - Just a little birthday card.<br> Yes, well, they're lovely.<br> You'll excuse me now?<br> You have some place to go, haven't you?<br> Are you putting me out?<br> What's the matter?<br> Don't you like the flowers?<br> - Oh, they're beautiful.<br> - They're not half so beautiful as you.<br> Any girl that can look beautiful<br> so early in the morning...<br> That sounds like you know<br> a lot about girls.<br> I do. I'm an expert.<br> - Much obliged for the compliment.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Well, so long.<br> - Must I go?<br> - Please do.<br> - And thank you for being so nice to me.<br> - Not half so nice as I'd like to be.<br> I'm arranging a little party tonight<br> for your birthday.<br> - A party for me?<br> - Yes.<br> Come in.<br> But you mustn't do that.<br> - But why not?<br> - Because I don't want you to.<br> That's silly. Everything's arranged.<br> You must come.<br> Please don't.<br> Hello, Eddie.<br> - Hello, Queenie.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> - How are you? Where's Hank?<br> - She's out.<br> Then I'm gonna wait right here<br> till she gets back.<br> Well, it looks as if I'd better<br> take the air.<br> I'll give you a ring a little later,<br> shall I?<br> Fine.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> And thank you again for the flowers.<br> Well, I've got my suspicions about<br> any guy that kisses a girl's hand.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - He'll give you a ring later.<br> He'll give you a ring.<br> On the telephone, but not here.<br> What are you burned up about?<br> - He hasn't done anything to you.<br> - No.<br> - And what's more, he ain't going to.<br> - Sit down and cool off.<br> Hank'll be here in a minute,<br> and you can start raving to her.<br> Oh, Eddie, don't be such a crab.<br> Why do you let a guy like that<br> hang around you?<br> Say, will you lay off him? I'm sick<br> of hearing you crab all the time.<br> - I'll give him a sock in the nose.<br> - You and how many others?<br> I don't need any others.<br> I can do it all by myself.<br> What do you think of that?<br> I know. But you haven't anything<br> to do in the show.<br> I can team you up with this blond<br> and still book you as the Mahoney Sisters.<br> Nope. I've gotta stick around<br> and keep an eye on Queenie.<br> Queenie? What has she been doing?<br> She's changed, Uncle Jed.<br> She don't tell me things anymore.<br> Night after night,<br> she's out with Jock Warriner.<br> If it wasn't for Queenie,<br> I'd be the happiest girl in the world.<br> With Eddie?<br> Now, now listen, Hank.<br> Why don't you give Eddie a break<br> and marry him?<br> - Maybe I will.<br> - Maybe.<br> Maybe that's just what Queenie needs:<br> - To see you and Eddie happy.<br> - Do you think so?<br> It's exactly what<br> I've been trying to... Sure!<br> Queenie, I didn't mean to get<br> all burned up about Jock Warriner.<br> Queenie, I couldn't sleep<br> at all last night, thinking of you.<br> On the level.<br> Queenie.<br> I wrote it for you.<br> I wrote it about you.<br> It's you. Don't you know what I mean?<br> No, no. Hank.<br> Aw, Queenie, l...<br> You keep your thoughts to yourself<br> about Jock. I like him.<br> Queenie, don't be so mean to Eddie.<br> You two both better lay off me<br> from now on.<br> I'm darn sick of being nagged.<br> She's just the same with me, Eddie,<br> every time I mention his name.<br> But look it.<br> "Happy birthday, Queenie."<br> That's great, Hank.<br> And wait till you see<br> what's coming up.<br> It's my old ring.<br> I had it reset for her.<br> She's always wanted a diamond,<br> and it's real platinum too.<br> - That's pretty, Hank.<br> - I've invited the whole gang tonight.<br> There's Uncle Jed<br> and the stage manager...<br> ...and Faye Fanchett<br> and the Flying Fools.<br> I'm gonna give her<br> the swellest party she ever had.<br> Oh, Eddie, I love her so.<br> You sure are regular, Hank.<br> Jock Warriner.<br> I wanna talk to her alone, Eddie.<br> I'll see you later<br> at the theater tonight.<br> All right, Hank.<br> Goodbye, Hank.<br> Oh, Queenie.<br> - You see, it's very simple.<br> - Rolling his own.<br> That's it.<br> Now, watch this one.<br> Boy, if you could do that<br> with my wife.<br> Say, give us something good,<br> something new.<br> Say, can you pull a rabbit from that?<br> Hello, everybody.<br> - I brought the radio with me.<br> - Joe, what have you got there?<br> - Gee, I can get Chicago with that.<br> - Chicago? Why, that's nothing.<br> - I got Scotland last night.<br> - How do you know you got Scotland?<br> Why, I heard the guy singing<br> "The Best Things in Life Are Free."<br> Take this cake in the other room,<br> and when you hear us yell "surprise"...<br> ...bring it back lighted.<br> Now, don't forget.<br> Hey, give me a few of those things.<br> Give me a few of them.<br> Someone's coming. Are you all set?<br> Quiet, quiet.<br> Surprise!<br> Surprise! Surprise!<br> - Well, where's Queenie?<br> - Yeah, where's Queenie?<br> Why, there was another party,<br> and I forgot to tell her about this one.<br> I thought she'd have more fun there.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Jock Warriner, huh.<br> Say, listen, I've got an idea.<br> Let's give the party...<br> Let's give the party...<br> - For Hank.<br> - Great!<br> Wait a minute, folks.<br> Just a second.<br> Take all the things down to my room.<br> We'll hold our party there.<br> Hank doesn't feel very well.<br> Well, all right,<br> we'll go down to your room.<br> Good night. I hope you feel better.<br> Look, Hank, I'm awfully sorry.<br> - I'm sorry, Hank.<br> - I left a present for you.<br> - I hope you're feeling better, Hank.<br> - We'll see you tomorrow.<br> You see what you're missing?<br> Why don't you have a little drink?<br> It might buck you up.<br> - Good night, Hankie.<br> - Good night, Uncle Jed.<br> Good night, dear.<br> Hey, Eddie.<br> Ain't you coming down?<br> You run along, Jed.<br> I've got to tell Hank something.<br> - I'll see you in a little while.<br> - Sure.<br> But don't make it too long. You know<br> that bottle won't last very long.<br> Queenie and me have always been<br> on the level.<br> And now I'm fronting for her.<br> Won't you please give her<br> all the best of the breaks?<br> What's the matter, Hank?<br> I lost something.<br> Oh, Eddie.<br> At least I've still got you.<br> That's one break.<br> Goodbye, baby.<br> Happy birthday.<br> Queenie, aren't you<br> having a good time?<br> I'm having a marvelous time,<br> Mr. Warriner.<br> Now don't call me Mr. Warriner.<br> Call me Jock, won't you?<br> All right.<br> Mr. Warriner.<br> - Wait a minute, everybody. Queenie.<br> - Oh, I can't.<br> I want you to stand up here<br> where everyone can see you.<br> - A toast!<br> - A toast to Queenie!<br> A happy birthday to Queenie,<br> the queen of New York's beautiful girls.<br> - Many happy returns!<br> - Happy birthday!<br> I can't say anything<br> but thanks, everybody. A lot.<br> Oh, it's a lovely surprise... Jock.<br> Oh, it's nothing at all.<br> Will you dance now?<br> That cake is just elegant...<br> ...but I can't eat it all.<br> Well, you eat as much as you can,<br> and we'll save the rest.<br> Please, Mr. Warriner,<br> ask them to play something else.<br> - I hate sentimental music.<br> - All right.<br> "Broadway Melody."<br> Don't wear a frown on old Broadway.<br> Tell me...<br> ...why don't you like that song?<br> I don't know.<br> Well, what do you like?<br> I like cake.<br> Won't you tell me that you like me a little?<br> Maybe.<br> You mean it?<br> Maybe.<br> Will you tell me why you're so nice to me?<br> Maybe.<br> Please, I wanna dance.<br> Oh, no, come on.<br> Let's sit this one out.<br> But look, everybody's dancing,<br> and the music is playing and everything.<br> Mr. Warriner.<br> You don't mean this for me?<br> Why, of course.<br> Diamonds should only<br> be worn by beautiful girls.<br> Oh, it's just adorable.<br> I'd like to do a lot of things<br> for you, Queenie.<br> How would you like<br> an apartment all your own?<br> Say, on Park Avenue.<br> And a car all your own.<br> Perhaps a Rolls-Royce.<br> Oh, and a lot of nice things.<br> Well, I'd have to think about that.<br> Say, where have you been?<br> I've been looking<br> all over the place for you.<br> You would come in at a time like this.<br> Certainly. Come on, little love boat.<br> Let's have this dance.<br> - Were you asleep, Hank?<br> - No, honey.<br> Well, that's swell,<br> because I wanna to tell you...<br> ...about the grandest party<br> that ever happened to me.<br> Look at that. Look at that. Did you ever see<br> anything more beautiful in all your life?<br> No, sirree. Because that's class, that is.<br> And Eddie said he wouldn't<br> even give me a ring.<br> What would I want with his ring?<br> There's more diamonds in a bracelet,<br> ain't they? Ain't they?<br> Honey, I don't know what<br> you're saying this for...<br> ...but I know you don't mean it.<br> You can't mean it.<br> - It ain't in you to mean it.<br> - Sure I mean it.<br> Why shouldn't I mean it?<br> And that ain't all I'm gonna have, either.<br> I'm gonna have a Rolls-Royce.<br> And an apartment on Park Avenue.<br> And everything that goes with it.<br> That's what I'm gonna have.<br> Now, honey, listen to me.<br> I know we ain't had the greatest break<br> in the world since we hit New York.<br> But that's gonna change.<br> That's got to.<br> And you're gonna meet<br> somebody that's right.<br> Somebody you can be proud of,<br> who'll just be crazy about you.<br> Somebody who's really worthy of you.<br> Somebody like Eddie.<br> Yeah? Well, that's all right for you...<br> ...but I ain't craving any hall-rooms...<br> ...with some song-and-dance guy...<br> ...who expects me to cook<br> his meals over a gas-jet...<br> ...listen to a lot of smart<br> wisecracks and bum songs.<br> - No, sir.<br> - Oh, Queenie.<br> Move over.<br> No more of these<br> kind of dumps for mine.<br> I'm gonna have everything<br> in the world I want.<br> That's me.<br> And you're gonna have Eddie.<br> Queenie, I don't want you<br> to answer me like that again.<br> - Then keep your nose out of my business.<br> - Well, your business is my business.<br> That package is from Warriner, ain't it?<br> - What if it is?<br> - I won't let you keep it, that's all.<br> How are you gonna stop me?<br> Oh, Queenie, don't you see what<br> I'm doing is for your own good?<br> And don't you see<br> what I'm doing is for your...<br> Oh, what are you talking about?<br> Now you listen to me.<br> You're not gonna go out<br> with that guy, hear me?<br> I'll stop you if I have to<br> tie you up to do it. You hear me?<br> Cut it out. Be quiet.<br> They can hear you out front.<br> Well, you hear me. I'm<br> going out with whoever I want...<br> ...and I won't hear orders<br> from anyone about it.<br> - Now get that and get it straight.<br> - Queenie!<br> You ain't my boss. So mind your<br> own business and shut up.<br> Oh, Queenie.<br> I won't shut up.<br> And you're gonna listen to me.<br> I won't listen to you any more than<br> I will to her. So you needn't get started.<br> - Getting near you, Kearns.<br> - All right.<br> Hank, you run along. I'll talk to her.<br> Now, listen, Queenie. You're young yet,<br> and you don't know things.<br> What Hank has been saying<br> to you is for your own good.<br> Yeah, and I suppose what you're<br> saying is for my own good too.<br> As far as that goes, yes, it is.<br> Whether you believe me or not,<br> I'm saying this because l...<br> - Hank finished that. Got nowhere with it.<br> - Well, I'm gonna get somewhere.<br> And whether you like me or hate me,<br> you're gonna pay attention to me...<br> ...because I'm...<br> Well...<br> Me and Hank won't let you<br> go out with that guy. He's no good.<br> - He wants girls who...<br> - You never went out with girls...<br> ...like he does.<br> - Plenty, but none since I met you.<br> You and Hank...<br> Get me right, sweetie.<br> I'm being on the level with you.<br> Here's your pants, sir.<br> - Hurry up, Kearns.<br> - All right.<br> Oh, can't I say nothing that will<br> make you see what I mean?<br> You're wasting time talking against<br> Mr. Warriner, if that's what you mean.<br> Mr. Warriner. Do you know<br> what they say about that guy?<br> I don't care what they say.<br> They're jealous, that's all.<br> - You and the rest.<br> - Me, jealous?<br> What are you so interested for?<br> What business is it of yours<br> where I go and who I go with?<br> It's my business because...<br> Well, because it is.<br> Oh, you ought to know<br> why I'm doing this.<br> - It's because l...<br> - No, no, Eddie. Don't say it.<br> Oh, I gotta say it, Queenie.<br> I can't stop from saying it now.<br> And you gotta hear it.<br> I love you, Queenie.<br> I love you, and you know it.<br> I can't help it. I tried, but I can't.<br> But it's easy to say now.<br> I love you, dear.<br> And I love you, Eddie. Never forget it.<br> - No matter what happens.<br> - Do you, Queenie?<br> Yes, Eddie.<br> And that's why we can't...<br> Oh, don't you see now why...<br> Why what?<br> - I'm going out with Jock Warriner...<br> - No, you're not.<br> Don't try to stop me, Eddie.<br> It's the best way.<br> Here's your coat, sir.<br> - Lf you go out with that guy, I'll...<br> - There's a stage wait, Kearns.<br> Let it wait.<br> Queenie, I gotta go on now.<br> - Promise me you won't go out with him.<br> - Are you trying to ruin the show?<br> - Promise me, Queenie.<br> - Oh, I can't promise.<br> - Then you won't?<br> - Well, then I won't.<br> I'll murder that guy. I'll tear him apart.<br> Go on out with him. Go ahead.<br> Get on there, Kearns.<br> Queenie, you better<br> be here when I get off.<br> - Get up to your dressing room.<br> - All right.<br> Oh, Queenie. You ain't got<br> no idea what you're doing.<br> Oh, yes, I have. Can't I have a little fun<br> without you trying to stop me?<br> Oh, I ain't trying<br> to stop you having fun...<br> ...but this thing will turn out bad.<br> That guy don't mean to marry you.<br> His kind don't never marry.<br> He ain't the type to take<br> a girl out and buy her drinks...<br> ...and let it go at that. You know that.<br> And you know what the finish will be.<br> Now listen to me, Hank.<br> Get this straight, once and for all.<br> I'm old enough to know<br> what I'm gonna do.<br> And I don't want no more cracks from you<br> and Mr. Wise-Guy Kearns about it either.<br> You can go your way, and I'll go mine.<br> What I'm saying's for your own good.<br> - Tell it to somebody you don't know.<br> - I ain't gonna let you get away with it.<br> - Give me that. That's mine.<br> - It's not yours...<br> - Well, it is mine, and you will give it...<br> - No, I won't.<br> You will give it to me.<br> Queenie.<br> Queenie, you mustn't go.<br> Queenie, you can't go.<br> Eddie, stop her.<br> Do something, will you?<br> - Queenie, just a moment, Queenie.<br> - Get your hands off me.<br> You're not gonna leave<br> except with me and Hank.<br> - You get out of my way.<br> - You heard what I said.<br> You can't get away with it.<br> I'll kill that guy just as sure as anything.<br> I'll make him suffer the way<br> he's making me suffer.<br> Shut up!<br> - I'm going.<br> - You can't go, Queenie.<br> Gonna stay right here. No.<br> Let go of me.<br> I've heard all I'm gonna hear from<br> either of you. You've said enough.<br> - I'd like to see you kill anybody.<br> - Queenie.<br> You dirty, cheap little songwriter, you.<br> I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!<br> Queenie, Queenie!<br> - Say, what kind of a sap are you, anyway?<br> - What do you mean?<br> You gonna let a john like that steal her from<br> you because he's got a little more jack?<br> Well, if you do, all I can say<br> is you're a rotten quitter.<br> You love her, don't you?<br> Oh, don't lie to me. I know you do.<br> Say, if I loved a girl<br> like you do Queenie...<br> ...l'd fight for her. What's the<br> matter with you? Where's your nerve?<br> - But, Hank, you don't...<br> - Oh, don't pass the buck to me.<br> What do you think I've been meaning all<br> along? I was on the level with this thing?<br> That I was in love with you?<br> That's a hot one.<br> I just been playing you for all<br> I could get out of you for the act.<br> - You been kidding me all the time?<br> - Sure, I been kidding you.<br> Say, I wouldn't marry you<br> if you was the last man on earth.<br> And at that, I ain't so sure<br> you're the right guy for her.<br> You're a coward.<br> You're afraid of Jock Warriner,<br> or you'd go out and fight for her.<br> - But you're just yellow.<br> - You think I'm yellow?<br> - Sure, you're yellow.<br> - I'll show you how much I'm yellow.<br> You're yellow. You hear me?<br> You're yellow.<br> - I'm yellow?<br> - Yes, you are. You're yellow!<br> You're yellow. Do you hear me?<br> Oh, Eddie, you're not yellow.<br> You're white.<br> Murray Hill-8400. Yes, please.<br> Hello.<br> Hello, Uncle Jed?<br> It's Hank.<br> Say, I've decided<br> to take those 30 weeks.<br> You can team me up with that blond.<br> I'm breathless.<br> Oh, I don't know what to say.<br> It's wonderful.<br> Oh, I can't thank you enough.<br> It's not half good enough for you.<br> I want you to have<br> everything in the world.<br> Thank you.<br> - Hello, Eddie.<br> - Where's Queenie?<br> I want you to meet my girlfriend.<br> - Come on, let's go back to the party.<br> - Oh, Queenie, not yet.<br> Why, I haven't had you<br> to myself for a moment tonight.<br> Oh, but I'd rather go back, please.<br> Wait, Queenie.<br> I have so many things<br> I want to tell you alone.<br> Oh, well, you can tell me out there.<br> Wait a minute, Queenie.<br> I've done all these things for you.<br> Aren't you going to be nice to me?<br> - Oh, Jock, let me go.<br> - Why should I let you go?<br> - Please let me go, please.<br> - No, I won't let you go.<br> You're going to stay right here with me.<br> - No, I'm not gonna stay here with you.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - I will keep you here.<br> You won't keep me here,<br> do you hear me? You won't.<br> - Let me go.<br> - I won't let you go.<br> I won't stay with you another minute.<br> - Let me go.<br> - I told you not to come here.<br> - Why did you come?<br> - Oh, Eddie, take me away.<br> What do you mean<br> coming in here? Get out.<br> - I won't before I'm finished with you.<br> - Oh, Eddie, let's go.<br> - I've been looking for you.<br> - Now that you've found me...<br> ...what do you want?<br> - I'll show you what I want.<br> Oh, Eddie.<br> What's the matter?<br> Oh, darling, let me see you.<br> Oh, Eddie. Have they<br> hurt you, sweetheart?<br> Have they?<br> You just hit him again if you dare.<br> Just try it, that's all.<br> - Eddie, let me see you.<br> - Queenie, Queenie.<br> You don't realize what you're doing.<br> You let me go. And you can take<br> your jewelry and your presents...<br> ...and everything. I don't want<br> anything to do with you.<br> Let me get a sock at that guy.<br> - No, Eddie don't...<br> - Let me get at him, just let me get at him.<br> - I wanna get at that guy.<br> - Throw him out.<br> - Out he goes.<br> - No, don't.<br> Don't let them. They're going to kill him.<br> Oh, Eddie. Don't you do that to him.<br> And stay out.<br> What do you know about that guy?<br> Got rid of that guy anyhow.<br> Oh, Eddie. Eddie, dear.<br> You dirty bums, you.<br> - Oh, Eddie, have they hurt you?<br> - What do you think?<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - I'll bet you are.<br> I am.<br> I don't know why you feel<br> sorry for anybody like me.<br> I'm no good.<br> I can't even scrap a little.<br> I let a heel like that take a sock<br> at me and get away with it.<br> Well, Eddie, he's bigger than you are.<br> - Yeah, a little bigger.<br> - And he's awfully strong.<br> I suppose you found<br> that out from his hugs.<br> Well, if you couldn't stop<br> them from throwing you out...<br> ...how could I stop him from hugging me?<br> Well, there's something in that.<br> I guess you'd better go home.<br> Oh, Eddie, aren't you<br> gonna take me home?<br> - I'll take you home.<br> - Don't you like me anymore?<br> Like you? Why, Queenie, l...<br> Oh, what is it? They've<br> hurt you, I know they have.<br> Oh, I'm all right, Queenie.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Now understand, it took<br> six of them to throw me out.<br> Yes, Eddie.<br> Oh, what is it?<br> Oh, they'll be here any minute.<br> What does it...? What does it...?<br> Read it.<br> "Arriving 2:30, wonderful honeymoon.<br> See you the minute we get in.<br> Love to our Hank, Queenie and Eddie."<br> Oh, I'm so excited. What time is it?<br> - 12:00 last night.<br> - It's what?<br> Well, what's the matter with this thing?<br> See who that is.<br> - Hello, Jed.<br> - Hank!<br> Oh, gee.<br> - Hello, Eddie.<br> - Hello, Hank.<br> Oh, come here.<br> Well, well, Queenie.

Hotels for mine,<br> where I can get service.<br> - I'd be all out of step in a real home.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - You're coming to live with us, all right.<br> - I should say she is.<br> Just like a trouper.<br> Troupers are all tramps.<br> Here today and gone tomorrow.<br> No home, no nothing.<br> Hank, you're just a born trouper.<br> Doggone this weather. It certainly<br> is tough on colds, isn't it?<br> Well, say, I want Queenie<br> and Eddie to see the act.<br> Say, where is that blond, anyway?<br> I don't know. She's always late.<br> Hank, you're a sight for sore eyes.<br> - Hello, Uncle Jed.<br> - Oh, hello, Flo.<br> - You know everybody, don't you?<br> - Hello, darling.<br> - Oh, Eddie.<br> - Hello, Flo.<br> Oh, Eddie, tell me, did you have<br> a good time on your honeymoon?<br> Yeah, great.<br> Oh, Eddie, when you<br> open your new show...<br> ...gonna give me a job, aren't you?<br> - Why, certainly.<br> Oh, you're grand.<br> Say, come on, stupid.<br> Let's run through the act for them.<br> Okay.<br> But, say, you know something?<br> She's a born trouper.<br> We're gonna break in the act<br> and bring it to New York.<br> - That's great.<br> - Say, step on it, will you?<br> - I've got a matinee.<br> - Sure.<br> I want two choruses...<br> ...and you follow us, not us you.<br> - Come on, Flo.<br> Say, listen. There's gonna be no part<br> in your show for that dame, get me?<br> Of course not, honey.<br> It's kind of rough yet, but don't<br> you say it's pretty good for an opening?<br> You know, if you don't hurry,<br> you're gonna miss that train.<br> - Oh, the train.<br> - Sure, the train.<br> Oh, Hank. Hank, can I help you?<br> Yes, you could hold my coat for me.<br> I forgot all about the thing.<br> Oh, Hank.<br> That's all right, Queenie.<br> - Goodbye, Eddie.<br> - Goodbye, Hank.<br> Oh, you'll write to me soon, won't you?<br> Yeah, I'll write you from Peoria.<br> Now, where's my hat? Where's my hat?<br> - Oh, where's my hat!<br> - Here's your hat.<br> Here. Here. Here's your valise.<br> - All right. Bring it, Uncle Jed. Come on.<br> - It's pretty heavy.<br> - Goodbye, Hank.<br> - Goodbye, Hank.<br> - Goodbye, Hank.<br> - Don't forget to write. Goodbye.<br> Oh, don't cry, dear.<br> Hank won't be gone long.<br> The season will be over before you<br> know it, and she'll be back here with us.<br> It ain't that, honey.<br> But it seems like Hank<br> ain't never had a real break.<br> And I guess I haven't done much<br> to make her any happier.<br> I wouldn't feel that way about it, dear.<br> Hank'll be much happier back on the road.<br> Why, she couldn't give it up.<br> It's her life.<br> She couldn't live without it.<br> And now that she knows<br> you're taken care of...<br> Don't cry, honey.<br> People can't help falling in love.<br> It comes to you no matter what you do.<br> And I love you, dear.<br> Oh, and I love you, Eddie.<br> You were just meant for me.<br> Opening in Peoria.<br> Four shows a day.<br> Zanny said he'd make me<br> a star in six months.<br> Say, listen, it's better to star in...<br> In Oshkosh than to starve on Broadway.<br> That's a bunk.<br> Say, now you listen to me,<br> stupid. I'll handle things.<br> Yes, and I'll have you back on Broadway<br> and in the Palace in less than six months.<br> - No fooling?<br> - Why, it's cream in the can, baby.<br> Sure, it's...<br> It's... It's in the can.<br>
