                        Today you are full-fledged ensigns.<br> Three months ago, you assembled here|from all walks of life. -<br> - Field, factory,|office and college.<br> Each of you knew|what the fighting was about.<br> Each of you knew that the American|way of life must be defended.<br> From here on, your education|must continue in the school of war.<br> As an ensign|in the United States Navy. -<br> - You go down to the sea to fight in|the toughest conflict of all time.<br> We Americans are confident that|you will serve the Navy with honour.<br> Good luck and good hunting.<br> Willie, over here!<br> - Darling, I'm so proud of you.|- Congratulations, Willie.<br> I hope the Navy|makes full use of your abilities.<br> Perhaps I could help you|be placed somewhere else.<br> Good luck for now.<br> Mother, I'll have to skip your party|tonight. The fellas are celebrating.<br> But the party's in your honour.<br> Your friends will forgive you.|You can call them from the house.<br> I'll see you at ten.<br> May...<br> - You were wonderful.|- Your mother let you out?<br> I had to be with her. I should|have told you yesterday. I'm sorry.<br> - Get me a drink, then we'll fight.|- Leo, two Scotch and waters.<br> Let's not spoil the night.|I've only got a couple of days left.<br> - I'm leaving Sunday.|- How do you expect me to feel?<br> You left me standing there alone.|Why couldn't I meet your mother?<br> - There's a time for everything.|- I'm sure.<br> To the most important woman|in your life... Mom.<br> - May, stop it.|- I'm sorry, Willie.<br> I didn't mean to ruin your evening.|I just bruise easily.<br> What do we do to celebrate?<br> We can go to the Fairmont...|Or we don't have to go to a club.<br> - Meaning what?|- I've only got 48 hours.<br> - Willie, don't.|- May, I love you.<br> All right.|Will you marry me?<br> If there were more time...<br> I didn't expect you to.<br> I forgot who I was. Just another|nightclub singer for a big weekend.<br> I don't want any more of it.|Not another minute.<br> - Good luck, Mr Keith.|- Thanks, George.<br> Goodbye, Mother.<br> Cable me from Pearl Harbour.|Your ship's been in lots of battles.<br> Do you have enough spending money?|You'd better take this extra $100.<br> - Mother, please don't cry.|- You're all I have left.<br> Promise me you'll be careful. Don't|volunteer or do anything dangerous.<br> I won't. I promise.|Goodbye, sweetheart.<br> Request permission|to come on board.<br> - The Caine's a real beauty.|- The Caine is the inboard ship.<br> This way, Keith.<br> Watch that enthusiasm.|This is the Caine.<br> - I'm sorry, I lost my footing.|- This is Lieutenant Tom Keefer.<br> Your orders. They transform|ex-civilians into men without minds.<br> - I hate to do this to you.|- Gangway, lady with a baby!<br> Meatball, Horrible,|pick up Mr Keith's gear.<br> This is our executive officer,|Steve Maryk.<br> Steve's the guy|who gets things done.<br> Come on, let's meet the captain.<br> - Watch your feet, sir!|- Come on, Keith!<br> It's a mistake scraping this ship.|The rust is keeping the water out.<br> - What do you want?|- He's here, sir.<br> - Bring him in.|- In here, Keith.<br> Captain DeVriess,|this is Ensign Keith.<br> May I see your orders,|or are they a military secret?<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> Princeton, 1941...<br> Top five percent|in midshipman's school...<br> Pretty good background,|pretty good record.<br> - Disappointed it's a minesweeper?|- To be honest, yes, sir.<br> - You saw yourself on a battleship?|- I had hoped that...<br> I only hope that|you're good enough for the Caine.<br> - I'll try to be worthy of the job.|- The Caine is a beaten-up tub.<br> After 18 months of combat, it takes|24 hours a day to keep her together.<br> I don't think you understand.|You're in the junkyard navy.<br> Steve, put in with Keefer|in Communications. -<br> - And have Tom show this Princeton|Tiger and the other ensign the ship.<br> And Keith...<br> Don't take it so hard.|War is hell.<br> - Ensign Keith, Ensign Harding.|- My condolences.<br> Let's get with it.|The USS Caine is a minesweeper.<br> These paravanes carry sweep wires|off both sides of the ship.<br> The wire saws the mine in two.<br> We've been in combat a year and a|half, and we've never swept a mine.<br> This ship was designed by geniuses|to be run by idiots.<br> This is the engine room. To operate,|all you need is a monkey.<br> 99 percent of what we do is routine,|one percent requires intelligence.<br> - That does it. Any more questions?|- Where do we go to surrender?<br> - It's not that easy.|- You don't like the Navy.<br> Just one more thing to do.|Climb the mast.<br> What for?<br> A tour is from the keel|to the foretop. That's the foretop.<br> I'm very fond of my wife and kid.|I'll probably never see them again.<br> Well done!<br> - I'm glad he liked it.|- Yeah.<br> Keith, I'm gonna be sick.|I'm sorry.<br> Height bothers me.|Those poor sailors down there.<br> - This is the only hat I've got.|- I have two others.<br> That's darn cordial of you.<br> What's keeping you up there?|Lunch!<br> - Excuse me, sir.|- It's all right.<br> Now that you've studied the Caine|up close, do you like her better?<br> - The tour was very interesting.|- Is the ship too messy for you?<br> The question is,|"Is this mess a ship?"<br> It's decent of you to join us.|I didn't think you had time.<br> Even the greatest of|literary artists gets hungry.<br> Pull up a chair, Tom, and|cast some pearls before the swine.<br> I have to protect these fresh young|faces from the captain's badgering.<br> I'm just conducting|a one-man board of inquiry.<br> I'm trying to find out if|Ensign Keith wants to stay on board.<br> There is no escape from the Caine.|We are all doing penance.<br> Sentenced to an outcast ship, manned|by outcasts, named after an outcast.<br> - Here we go again.|- It's a fact.<br> I've been trying for two years to be|relieved of command without luck.<br> But then... I don't have|Ensign Keith's influence.<br> I don't understand.<br> I received this dispatch from|Admiral Wards about an hour ago.<br> "Will request transfer to my staff|for Ensign Willis Steward Keith."<br> "Understand of course|needs of USS Caine have priority."<br> - I didn't know anything about this.|- Could be coincidence.<br> Or someone pulling strings.<br> What'll it be? The admiral's staff|or the hell of the Caine?<br> - I don't know.|- Do you want to fight a war?<br> - He shouldn't have to decide here.|- A good officer would be able to.<br> - Come on, we haven't got all day.|- Well, sir...<br> - I'll stay on board, sir.|- That takes care of that.<br> You will live to regret this day.<br> Sir, I spotted a Japanese aircraft|off the starboard bow. Angle 20.<br> See him?<br> If you stay ten years, you may learn|to tell an aircraft from a seagull.<br> Man all stations|for minesweeping drill.<br> Launch sweep gear.<br> Port paravanes in the water.<br> - That was a lousy performance.|- Stand by to stream starboard side.<br> Retrieve sweep gear.<br> Snap it up.|The Jones is beating us.<br> - Stop the engines. Get me a line.|- The water's full of sharks.<br> - Stand by the line.|- Yes, sir.<br> This dispatch just arrived.<br> I'll take care of it right away.<br> Haul away!<br> Lead the line|outboard of everything.<br> Report float recovered.<br> The Jones never could beat us.<br> You pooped out! We streamed three|minutes quicker at Guadalcanal.<br> You must love that guy|to do what you did for him.<br> Go dry yourself, Keith.<br> - Is that you, Willie?|- Yeah.<br> Didn't you go to Princeton? Maybe|I'll let you read some of my novel.<br> - Your opinion might be valuable.|- Thanks.<br> Horrible,|pick up those orange peels.<br> Meatball, laugh once more|and you're in trouble.<br> Ensign Keith, report to|the captain's cabin. On the double.<br> These 90-day wonders. They all|think they're five-star admirals.<br> Come in.<br> Three days ago, this ship received a|dispatch addressed to us for action.<br> - Smitty says he gave it to you.|- Yes, sir. I forgot about it.<br> - Did you decode the message?|- No, sir.<br> - It's incredible stupidity...|- I had it done for you.<br> - That'll be all, Smitty.|- Yes, sir.<br> Keith.<br> Do you know how serious misplacing|an action dispatch can be?<br> I don't think you do.<br> This ship might have failed|to carry out a combat assignment.<br> I'd bear the full responsibility|in a court martial.<br> I understand, sir.<br> I've been filling out|officers' fitness reports.<br> - How should this affect yours?|- Anyone can make a mistake.<br> There are mistakes and mistakes.|The margin for error is narrow here.<br> There's too much loss of life|and property damage possible.<br> Here.|Read it.<br> "Ensign Keith seems|a fairly bright young man."<br> "He may become a competent officer|once he overcomes...<br> ...a careless approach|to his duties."<br> - Is it unfair?|- Sir, if I may be permitted...<br> I made a mistake, but I don't think|I should be singled out for it.<br> The Caine's a slack ship. The decks|look like a Singapore junk.<br> You must also|strongly disapprove of me.<br> - Go ahead, man to man.|- I'm in no position to judge.<br> My conception of a captain|is different from yours.<br> I'll take it under advisement.|Since you feel so bitter. -<br> - Perhaps what's in the dispatch|will brighten your day.<br> As you can see,|I'm being relieved of command.<br> Next week|you'll have a new captain.<br> Lieutenant Commander|Philip Francis Queeg. Feel better?<br> - Definitely, sir.|- Good. That'll be all, Keith.<br> In accordance with|Bureau of Naval Personnel. -<br> - Order 01602 1 of November 1943. -<br> - You'll report to and relieve the|commanding officer of the USS Caine.<br> Signed, Louis Whitfield,|Rear Admiral, USN, Chief of Bureau.<br> I relieve you, sir.<br> All standing orders to remain|in force. Dismiss the men.<br> - Good luck, Captain.|- Thank you.<br> Crew dismissed.<br> I could stay aboard a few days|till you get used to things.<br> There's no need for that. We all|have our own ways of running a ship.<br> This one's tired. She ought|to be melted down for razor blades.<br> The crew's tired, too.|But every man is okay.<br> - I understand.|- I hope you do.<br> Yours, Captain.<br> Attention on deck.<br> - Request permission to leave.|- Captain, sir?<br> - What is it, Meatball?|- Nothing, sir.<br> A few of the guys chipped in and...<br> Whose idea was this?<br> - It's against Navy regulations.|- You don't go by regulations.<br> That's my trouble.|I've been aboard the Caine too long.<br> You take an even strain with the|new skipper, and it'll be all right.<br> - I'm leaving the ship, sir.|- Yes, sir.<br> What do you know? Somebody|left his watch lying around.<br> I might as well have a souvenir.|Not a bad-looking watch at that.<br> - What time is it?|- 11:00.<br> Make it 10:30.|I'll keep it a half hour slow -<br> - To remind me|of the fouled-up crew of the Caine.<br> Carry on.<br> What's everybody so choked up for?<br> I still think|that someday you'll make an officer.<br> Captain Queeg requests|a meeting of all officers at 13:00.<br> We'll be shipmates for a long time.|We should get acquainted.<br> I've formed some impressions.|You're probably curious about me.<br> My background is simple.|Just another naval officer.<br> I've had seven years|in the Atlantic.<br> The last two were very interesting.<br> I thought they had it in for me|personally. Let's get down to cases.<br> I'm a book man. I believe everything|in it was put in for a purpose.<br> On this ship,|we do things by the book.<br> Deviate from the book|and you'll get an argument from me.<br> I don't lose arguments on my ship.|That's why it's nice to be captain.<br> Remember, on board my ship|excellent performance is standard. -<br> - Standard performance|is sub-standard and does not exist.<br> Now that I've shot my face off, I'll|give you the chance to do the same.<br> It's been a long time since|this crew did things by the book.<br> There are four ways|of doing things on board my ship:<br> The right way, the wrong way,|the Navy way and my way.<br> Do it my way and we'll get along.<br> Okay?|Anyone else?<br> Come in.<br> Sorry to interrupt.|Official message.<br> Thank you.<br> One moment, messenger.<br> - What's your name and rate?|- Urban, sir. Seaman First.<br> - Very well. You may go.|- Yes, sir.<br> Gentlemen, did you notice anything|peculiar about Seaman Urban?<br> A shirt-tail outside trousers|is the uniform for bus boys. -<br> - Not for a sailor in the US Navy.|We will start noticing these things.<br> - Who's the Morale Officer?|- There is none.<br> - Who's the Junior Ensign?|- Keith, sir.<br> Mr Keith,|you are now the Morale Officer.<br> See to it that every man keeps|his shirt-tail inside his trousers.<br> If I see|another shirt-tail flapping. -<br> - Woe betide the sailor, the OOD and|the Morale Officer. I kid you not.<br> We are to proceed to Area X-ray|at 08:00 tomorrow to tow targets.<br> The Caine is going to be the best|target-towing ship in this navy.<br> That'll be all, gentlemen.<br> I want the men to have their hair|cut and their faces shaven by 24:00.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Well, he's certainly Navy.|- Yeah, so was Captain Bligh.<br> Attention all hands.<br> Ships will commence firing at 10:00.|Observers lay out to the fantail.<br> Flash.|Short. 200. Over.<br> 100. 250.<br> Hit. Over.|100. 250.<br> Short. 100.|Over. 150. 200.<br> Ensign Keith, report to the bridge.<br> Have you any explanation|for the appearance of this sailor?<br> You heard my order on shirt-tails.|Tuck your shirt in, now.<br> - The captain won't let me.|- See the rotten job you're doing?<br> - Gwendelyn, this is Tarzan.|- Tarzan, this is Gwendelyn.<br> Cease present exercises|and return to base. Well done. Out.<br> Roger.|Thank you, sir.<br> We're heading back.|Right standard rudder.<br> Now, Mr Keith...|Do you have an explanation for this?<br> I didn't ask for an alibi. My orders|must mean very little to you.<br> - I'm at fault, but I tried my best.|- Yes, a maximum of inefficiency.<br> What's the matter with the old man?|We're steaming in a circle.<br> - Captain...|- Don't interrupt me.<br> One more word, and you're on report.<br> - You were the officer of the deck.|- A man can't be everywhere at once.<br> You are equally as responsible|for your duties as I am for mine.<br> And one thing more.|War is a 24-hour job.<br> There will be no more|novel-writing on the Caine.<br> Mr Keith, Mr Keefer, you will|submit written reports explaining:<br> A, why his shirt-tail was out.|B, why you didn't obey my orders.<br> Meatball, look! We're|cutting back across our tow line.<br> It's impossible.|But it's happening!<br> We're gonna cut our own tow line.|You'd better tell him again.<br> What's happening?|What's going on?<br> What's our target doing out there?<br> What are you doing?|You idiot. All engines stop.<br> - We've steamed over our tow line.|- Who said we did that?<br> - We've cut the target adrift.|- No. We had a faulty cable.<br> We can hardly be held responsible|if we're given faulty cables.<br> Should we recover the target?<br> No. We'll be the last ship back|in Pearl Harbor. No thank you.<br> We don't want a lot of questions|about this. It's not our fault.<br> - Reel in the cable.|- Aye, aye, sir.<br> Mr Keefer,|send the following dispatch.<br> "Defective tow line parted,|south-west corner, X-ray."<br> "Target adrift.|Menace to navigation."<br> "Suggest tug,|recover or destroy."<br> He'll never get away with it.<br> Let's head for the barn.|All engines ahead full.<br> All engines ahead full, sir.<br> Willie, you look worried.<br> A man's shirt's a petty detail, but|big things are made up of details.<br> For want of a nail, a horseshoe|was lost, and then the whole battle.<br> A captain's job is a lonely one.|He's easily misunderstood.<br> Forget that I bawled you out. It|was good for the morale of everyone.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Look what just came in.|We're going back to San Francisco.<br> Thanks to Captain Queeg.|He's in plenty of hot water.<br> - The Navy won't accept his story.|- They're sending us back for that?<br> "Upon arrival,|Commanding Officer USS Caine -<br> - Report immediately|Commander Western Sea Frontier."<br> He's about to be boiled in oil.|And you'll be seeing your girl.<br> Willie!<br> - Willie, darling.|- Mother.<br> - This is a real surprise.|- You didn't expect me to stay away?<br> Mother... I'd like you|to meet a friend of mine. May Wynn.<br> I'm always delighted|to meet Willie's friends.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello, May?|Sure. I'll be right down. Okay.<br> I'm ready to go.|It's just a weekend at Yosemite.<br> - A sailor needs some play time.|- Miss Wynn is going with you?<br> Yes, she is.<br> - You must feel strongly about her.|- I do. I like her a lot.<br> - You have a nice weekend yourself.|- Are you in love with her?<br> I don't know. But I missed her|every minute I was away.<br> She is attractive, but you|don't know anything about her.<br> - You haven't even met her parents.|- I'll have to do that someday.<br> For your own sake,|promise you won't do anything rash.<br> - I promise.|- Do you mean it?<br> Goodbye, Mom.<br> Easy, May.|That's good.<br> - How did you like it?|- Like a new song. Fun but scary.<br> It was nice of your mother|to let you come.<br> - It wasn't up to my mother.|- Well...<br> - War has made a difference.|- Has it?<br> I missed you more than I planned to.<br> Let the fire fall!<br> This is paradise.<br> - Willie, there are people.|- Let them look.<br> You have changed.

Sorry I'm late.|I'm used to having an alarm clock.<br> - What a day. Have you ordered yet?|- Not yet.<br> - Orange juice and coffee.|- Make it two.<br> I'd love to take a long walk.|Climb to the top of that mountain.<br> - Darling, what's the matter?|- Just thinking.<br> Something's the matter.|I expected you to be happy.<br> Would you spend|the rest of your life with me?<br> - What's this?|- Let's get married.<br> - Is that what you really want?|- Yes. Don't look at me like that.<br> Is it because you feel sorry for me,|and it's the decent thing to do?<br> I love you and I want to marry you.|Yes or no?<br> - No.|- Why not?<br> Your mother won't approve.<br> - Of course she'll approve.|- She won't, and you'll be unhappy.<br> I won't be unhappy.|I love you.<br> Maybe you do... really do.<br> But marriage|has to be by your own approval.<br> That's asking a lot, May.<br> That's right.<br> Have a good cry, Willie.|I know I will.<br> In another 30 seconds|you'd have been AWOL.<br> - I just got the telegram.|- You couldn't leave your girl?<br> - Any news on Queeg?|- Stand by to cast off.<br> Have you been inconvenienced, |Mr Keith?<br> You made a mistake, Tom.|He's still here.<br> My mistake was nothing|compared to the Navy's.<br> As you probably know, we returned|to San Francisco to get a new radar.<br> However, certain misleading reports|were sent to the Force Commander.<br> He doubted the Caine's competence|as to being returned to combat.<br> I told him not to expect me to pull|the Caine into shape overnight.<br> There will be no further mistakes|from the officers and crew.<br> - The smoke went down the wrong way.|- This is an important command.<br> The Navy's waiting for me to make|a mistake, but I won't make it.<br> So much for old business.<br> Gentlemen, I have good news for you.<br> We're on our way to|the greatest invasion of this war.<br> I kid you not.|Let's straighten up and fly right.<br> All hands, put on battle dress.<br> All hands, put on battle dress.<br> We can scare the Japs to death.<br> Cease fire, cease fire.<br> Take stations.|Mr Keith, take the con.<br> That's the group we're to take in.|Jacob Group Four.<br> Come right to course 045.|All engines ahead full.<br> We're gonna run those boats down.|Where's the captain?<br> - He's on the wing.|- Why isn't he handling the ship?<br> All engines stop.<br> Boats ahoy!<br> - What's going on? Who's yelling?|- We were overshooting these boys.<br> - What's the distance to the beach?|- About three miles.<br> Steve, you get us there.|Full speed ahead.<br> We will proceed.|Follow us. Good luck.<br> Left tangent: 006.<br> - Beacon: 084.|- Distance: 5,000.<br> We're too far ahead.|All engines back one third.<br> Left tangent: 350.<br> - Beacon: 116.|- Distance: 4,000.<br> Why are we slowing down?

Running away?|- Don't look for trouble, Tom.<br> - What do you think of your boy now?|- I don't know.<br> - There must be a reason for this.|- Yeah. There's a reason, all right.<br> I've got those yellowstain blues|those silly yellowstain blues<br> when someone fires a shot|it's always there I am not<br> I've got those yellowstain blues|the old yellowstain blues<br> those yellowstain blues.<br> - We'd better pipe down.|- Don't worry.<br> It's about time you got over being|impressed by parents and captains.<br> - Thanks, Dad.|- More.<br> I've got those yellowstain blues|down from my head to my shoes<br> you should see strong men quail|if he should spy a shirt-tail...<br> - Cut it.|- Steve, I thought you'd be amused.<br> It's the saga of a man with very|little charm and even less courage.<br> It's not funny.|Find someone else to sing about.<br> - Old Yellowstain will be flattered.|- Don't use that name again.<br> - The captain wants a meeting.|- And he kids us not.<br> Don't get up, please. I'm not|feeling well. This won't take long.<br> That'll be all, steward.<br> I know that some of you|are a little afraid of me.<br> I'm not that terrible.|I have a wife and a child and a dog.<br> They're rather fond of me. Even|the dog doesn't think I'm a monster.<br> Certain things happened today.<br> A command is a lonely job.|It isn't easy to make decisions.<br> Sometimes the captain of a ship|needs help... constructive loyalty.<br> A ship is like a family.

My headache's much worse.<br> Yes, sir.<br> This is what is known|in literature as the pregnant pause.<br> Let's write to Walter Winchell.<br> - I almost felt sorry for him.|- Don't be so sentimental, Willie.<br> I thought it was a good speech.<br> It was close to an apology.|We could have backed him up.<br> He turned yellow|the first time we got into action.<br> You knew nothing about DeVriess|and you know even less about Queeg.<br> He's tired.|His nerves are shot.<br> A man can lose his head|after what Queeg has gone through.<br> That's endearing, but it won't hold.<br> Has it ever occurred to you that|our captain might be unbalanced?<br> I know about abnormal behaviour.<br> Captain Queeg has every symptom of|acute paranoia. He'll snap any day.<br> - Step outside.|- I'd like to stay.<br> - Let him. He studied psychology.|- You're fooling with dynamite.<br> The man is a Freudian delight.|He crawls with clues.<br> The rolling balls, the second-hand|phrases, the migraine headaches...<br> Shirt-tails, and tonight's speech:|I turned yellow but my dog likes me.<br> - I think Tom does make sense.|- You stay out of this.<br> So he has migraine headaches|and he rolls steel balls. So what?<br> You used to get up before reveille|and scribble on papers.<br> Everybody's a screwball in some way.<br> You're kidding yourself, Steve.<br> Will you go to the medical officer|with me and repeat what you've said?<br> - Do you agree with my diagnosis?|- Not even if I understood it.<br> I'm not doing it alone. If you|can't see it, they won't believe me.<br> Let's drop it. There'll be no more|talk of the captain being crazy.<br> - It can only blow up in our faces.|- I still insist he's paranoid.<br> See this bible?<br> I swear on this, I'll report|anything further you say about it.<br> There's no more friendship|on this point.<br> 25.000<br> Medical log|on Lieutenant Commander X-ray.<br> The possibility appears to exist -<br> - That the commander of this ship|may be mentally disturbed.<br> March 5, 1944. This evening, |as usual, we were showing a Western.<br> Stop the picture!|Will you please stop this picture!<br> Attention on deck!<br> - Why wasn't I told about the movie?|- You don't want to see Westerns.<br> This was calculated disrespect|to your commanding officer.<br> All right. There will be|no more movies for 30 days.<br> May 28, 1944. Morale couldn't|be lower. The crew is resentful.<br> The officers are just going through|the motions of carrying out orders.<br> Today, the captain ordered a general|drill for the safety of the crew.<br> This is the captain speaking. Many|of you aren't wearing battle gear.<br> Those not wearing a helmet or a life|jacket lose three days' liberty.<br> I see you! Knock that off!|Stop putting on that gear!<br> Put that man down there on report.|That one on number one machine gun.<br> You think you're clever.|You're not fooling me!<br> Get that red-headed fellow.<br> I can't tell which one's red-headed.|They're wearing their helmets.<br> This is the captain speaking. Some|of you think you can outsmart me.<br> You're mistaken. The innocent|will be punished with the guilty.<br> There will be no liberty for three|months. I won't be made a fool of.<br> July 30, 1944. Today we received|a gift from the USS Pinkney.<br> A gallon of frozen strawberries.<br> I was checking the watch at 0 1:00|when I spoke to Ensign Keith.<br> How's it going?<br> The captain's been put away|for the night.<br> - Lay off.|- I was with you at the beginning.<br> - But no ship can go on like this.|- You don't know that.<br> - I'm not blind.|- All right.<br> The captain's in rocky shape,|but he'll come out of it.<br> The captain wants a meeting|of all officers.<br> - At 01:00? What's it about?|- Strawberries.<br> - Are you sure this is a gallon can?|- Yes, sir. It's a lard can.<br> You must be wondering|why I called you here.<br> We had an excellent dessert tonight,|ice cream and frozen strawberries.<br> An hour ago, I sent for another|portion but got only the ice cream.<br> There weren't any more strawberries.<br> I don't believe that the officers|consumed a gallon of strawberries.<br> Mr Maryk, how many portions of ice|cream and strawberries did you have?<br> Two, sir.<br> Dole out a scoop of sand|for each portion.<br> - Mr Keefer, how many for you?|- Three, Captain.<br> - Keith?|- Two, sir.<br> - Harding?|- Two, sir.<br> - Painter?|- Two, sir.<br> - Comedy? Jorgensen...?|- Two, sir.<br> - And the steward's mates had three?|- Yes, one helping each.<br> - Mr Keith said it was okay.|- Yes, I did.<br> And I had four.<br> 24 portions in all.<br> This tureen holds as much sand|as we had strawberries tonight.<br> Mr Maryk,|tell me how much sand is left.<br> Maybe a quart,|or a little less.<br> Have any of you an explanation for|the quart of missing strawberries?<br> Someone else finished them for us.<br> You will all investigate to find out|who's responsible for this theft.<br> - Mr Maryk, you're in charge.|- You mean in the morning?<br> Now, by my watch, does not|mean in the morning, but 01:47.<br> I expect a full report by 08:00.<br> Pipe down. Let's get this done|so we can get some sleep.<br> Send in the stewards.<br> If only the strawberries had been|poisoned, we'd be done with this.<br> We've learned nothing further about|the missing quart of strawberries.<br> - Unsatisfactory.|- Sorry, Captain.<br> We kept the mess boys and the cook|most of the night. It's a dead end.<br> - We went over it all endlessly.|- You accomplished nothing.<br> I've thought the whole thing out.<br> Someone made a duplicate key|to the icebox.<br> - There's no indication...|- Some things we must assume.<br> When I was an ensign on a cruiser,|five pounds of cheese was missing.<br> Everybody forgot about it but me.<br> I found out a chow hound had made|a wax impression of the icebox key.<br> He confessed and I got a letter of|commendation. It's the same here.<br> We can't be sure there's a key...<br> I've got a simple plan. We tag every|key on board with the owner's name.<br> Then we strip all hands|to make sure we have all the keys.<br> Then we test each key|on the icebox padlock.<br> - The one that fits is the thief's.|- We don't know there's such a key.<br> - I say there's a key.|- The thief could toss it overboard.<br> He wouldn't do that after going|to the trouble of making it.<br> - He may hide it, but we'll find it.|- I never thought of that, sir.<br> Get on the ball. It should be fun|doing some detective work.<br> Steve, turn me in if you want to.|But this is over the line.<br> Queeg is a paranoid.|Can't you see what he's doing?<br> He's re-enacting his big triumph,|the cheese investigation.<br> He wants to be as hot as the young|Ensign Queeg. There is no key.<br> - What happened to the strawberries?|- Does it matter?<br> Would anyone but a crazy man care?<br> Steve, are you familiar with|Article 184 of Navy regulations?<br> Vaguely.<br> Listen to this. On the Caine|it's required reading. Article 184:<br> "Unusual circumstances may arise -<br> - In which the relief from duty of|a commanding officer is necessary.<br> Such action shall be subject to the|approval of the Navy Department. -<br> - Except when it is impracticable|because of the delay involved."<br> If I were you, I'd memorise it.<br> I'll take these to the captain.<br> - Great weather for stripping down.|- Great for pneumonia.<br> - Next.|- Meatball, you can get dressed.<br> - Don't you want to x-ray me?|- He swallowed his key.<br> Pipe down.<br> - So long, fellas.|- Are you escaping from the Caine?<br> - My wife is seriously ill.|- I'm sorry.<br> She'll be all right. We'll let you|know about the key investigation.<br> - Good luck, Harding.|- Thank you, sir.<br> If I tell you something, please|don't do anything till I'm ashore.<br> - What is it?|- There is no key.<br> - What?|- How do you know?<br> The mess boys ate the strawberries.|I saw them.<br> I kept my mouth shut because I|didn't want them to get in trouble.<br> But I told the captain. He said he'd|hold up my orders if I told anyone.<br> So please don't say anything.<br> I'm happy to get out|of this madhouse. So long.<br> I'll call all your wives and girls|for you.<br> - Well...|- I've thought about what you said.<br> I've thought about Article 184,|and I have to admit you're right.<br> Admiral Halsey is here|with the fleet. Let's go see him.<br> - Sure.|- You too, Willie.<br> Request permission to come on board.|Admiral Halsey's quarters.<br> Lt. Jones, these gentlemen|would like to see the admiral.<br> Just a minute please, gentlemen.<br> It's a fine time to think of this,|but we're making a big mistake.<br> - What are you talking about?|- Look.<br> This is the real navy,|with real officers, not Queegs.<br> - The Caine's a floating mistake.|- What are you driving at?<br> - They'll never believe us.|- Is the captain crazy or isn't he?<br> - Is this record correct or not?|- Yes, but we can't make it stick.<br> Everything there can be interpreted|as an attempt to enforce discipline.<br> - We know different.|- Because we've lived through it.<br> - Why didn't you tell me before?|- If we do this, we're in trouble.<br> It won't mean as much to us,|but you want to stay in the Navy.<br> This can smash your career. They'll|think you're a mutinous officer.<br> I'll risk it. Are you scared?<br> Scared? I see six sides to every|risk and 12 reasons not to take it.<br> Behind this eloquent exterior, I've|got a yellow streak 15 miles wide.<br> - I'm too smart to be brave.|- Admiral Halsey will see you.<br> - I pass.|- We've decided this isn't the time.<br> Station special C at anchor detail.|Make all preparations for sailing.<br> Make all preparations for heavy|weather. Dismissed from quarters.<br> - Steve, what do we do now?|- Without Tom, I'll get nowhere.<br> I never even heard the word paranoid|before he pulled it on me.<br> - I don't get it. Tom's no coward.|- I don't know what Tom is... now.<br> Hurry back. We received a storm|warning and the fleet's sailing.<br> Turn on the standard lights.<br> - The barometer's still dropping.|- I've seen it.<br> - Are you gonna take on ballast?|- No.<br> - I suggest that we do.|- I won't foul up the fuel lines.<br> We need more knots to outrun it.<br> Bridge to Engine Control. This is|the captain speaking. I want power.<br> Power on the starboard engine.|Emergency power.<br> Close that door.<br> - I've relieved the watch.|- Everyone put on life jackets.<br> It's difficult holding her.<br> We can't keep riding|with our stern to the wind.<br> - Those are fleet orders.|- Put the depth charges on safe.<br> - Mr Keefer told me to set them.|- Why wasn't I told?<br> - I told Mr Keefer...|- Put this man on report.<br> Get another helmsman.<br> - But Stillwell's our best man.|- Pay attention to my orders.<br> Number one switchboard shorted out.|Shifting to number two.<br> We're falling off to starboard.<br> Try backing the starboard engine.<br> - Back the starboard engine!|- Back the starboard engine.<br> Willie, look in the radar shack.|See if there are any ships near us.<br> If we keep our stern to the wind,|we'll roll over.<br> The radars are down.|There's no sign of the fleet.<br> - Swinging very fast.|- Captain, we have to manoeuvre.<br> The fleet didn't order us|to manoeuvre at discretion.<br> We don't know what our orders are.<br> - We're in trouble.|- No, we're not.<br> I can't hold the wheel.<br> Captain, back the starboard engine!<br> Captain!<br> Hold it a hard right!<br> - Ease your rudder to standard.|- Rudder easing to standard.<br> Heading 325.|She's coming around slower.<br> We'll head into the wind.|Steady on 000.<br> - Fleet course is 180.|- Captain, we're in serious trouble.<br> Don't question my decisions again.|Helmsman, come left.<br> Steady as you go.|Willie, note the time.<br> You're a sick man. I'm relieving|you of this ship under Article 184.<br> What are you talking about?|Helmsman, left 180.<br> - Mr Keith, what do I do?|- I told you to come left, and fast.<br> You're not issuing orders anymore.|I've relieved you.<br> - I take full responsibility.|- You're under arrest. Go below.<br> - Left to 180.|- Right standard rudder. Course 000.<br> - What do I do?|- Come north. Maryk's in command.<br> Call your relief.|You're under arrest, too.<br> All officers report to the bridge.<br> - What's up?|- I have just relieved the captain.<br> From now on, I will give all orders.|I take full responsibility.<br> Mr Keith backed you up.|He'll pay the same as you will.<br> If you officers know what's|good for you, tell them to stop.<br> You officers approve?|Do you, Mr Keefer?<br> - It isn't up to him to approve.|- You'll hang for mutiny.<br> Everybody back to their stations.|Hold the course 000.<br> - It's right over there.|- Thank you.<br> Yes?|This is Ensign Keith.<br> New York?|Thank you.<br> Hello?<br> - May?|- I've been phoning you all day.<br> - Are you all right?|- Yes.<br> Ensign Harding called and|told me that you were in trouble.<br> Willie, I'm worried.|Is your mother there with you?<br> - She's with my uncle. He's sick.|- Sorry to hear it.<br> It was wonderful of you to phone.<br> - May... darling.|- Willie, please don't.<br> What an idiot I was.<br> I could have married you in the|most beautiful place in the world.<br> - I'll always regret that I didn't.|- Don't... please.<br> It's over. It's all in the past.<br> I want you to know that I love you,|and I'll never forget you.<br> Goodbye, Willie.|Thank you.<br> Mr Maryk?|My name is Barney Greenwald.<br> Pleased to meet you.|Have a crack-up?<br> - Are you our lawyer?|- I'm a lawyer.<br> - Ensign Keith, Lieutenant Keefer.|- Keith. You're the co-defendant.<br> - And you, Mr Keefer?|- I'm holding his coat.<br> - I'm a friend of the family.|- That's pretty flip.<br> I was on board the Caine,|communications officer.<br> I read the report and frankly, I|think that what you've done stinks.<br> - Then why are you taking the case?|- I didn't say I'd take it.<br> I wanted to talk to Mr Maryk first.<br> - You should get another lawyer.|- Eight lawyers have turned it down.<br> At the moment, you have|an excellent chance of being hanged.<br> We'll answer anything|you want to know.<br> Are you a fool or a mutineer?|There's no third possibility.<br> - Should I have let the ship sink?|- Three ships were lost, you know.<br> And 194 stayed afloat without the|executive officer taking command.<br> - There was no other choice.|- Maybe I'm a fool. I'm no mutineer.<br> He had a paranoid skipper who went|to pieces, and he saved the ship.<br> The Navy has three psychiatrists|who will testify that Queeg is sane.<br> Paranoids walk a thin dividing line|between sanity and lunacy.<br> Are you a psychiatrist?<br> I'm a writer.|I'm a judge of human behaviour.<br> You were the first to notice|the captain's psychotic symptoms?<br> - Yes.|- Did you explain it to Mr Maryk?<br> - I discussed it.|- That's an interesting point.<br> - Would you repeat it in court?|- Why not?<br> Mr Keefer, you ought to take a look|at Article 186 of Navy regulations.<br> "An officer relieving his commanding|officer, or recommending it. -<br> - Together with others|who so counsel. -<br> - Must bear the responsibility for|and must justify such action."<br> That's confusing the issue.|I'm not on trial.<br> You're not an expert on psychiatry,|but you made the diagnosis.<br> Yes.<br> The atmosphere is getting thick|in here. I'll wait in the hall.<br> Tom had nothing to do with it.|Nobody told me what to do.<br> - Sure.|- Will you take the case?<br> I'd much rather prosecute.<br> I guess I can't blame you.<br> - I'll take it.|- How do we plead?<br> - Your case depends on Maryk.|- How do I plead?<br> Not guilty.|You're a great naval hero.<br> Charge: mutiny.<br> Specification: Steven Maryk,|Lieutenant, US Naval Reserve. -<br> - While serving on board the|USS Caine, did on July 31, 1944. -<br> - Wilfully and without authority|relieve Lt. Commander Queeg.<br> Queeg was engaged in the exercise|of his command, the US being at war.<br> Steven Maryk, how say you to the|specification? Guilty or not guilty?<br> - Not guilty.|- How say you to the charge?<br> Not guilty.<br> The prosecution|is prepared to prove -<br> - That the removal of Lt. Commander|Queeg was not justified. -<br> - And consequently,|constituted a mutiny.<br> We will submit psychiatric testimony|establishing without a doubt -<br> - That Lt. Commander Queeg is sane|and should not have been relieved.<br> No statement at this time.<br> The prosecution would like to call|Ensign Willis Stewart Keith.<br> Were you the officer of the deck|on the DMS Caine on July 31?<br> Was the captain relieved of command|by Mr Maryk during that watch?<br> Do you know why Mr Maryk|took the action that he did?<br> The ship was in imminent danger|of foundering.<br> - You've been in a foundering ship?|- No, sir.<br> - When did you join the Navy?|- A little over a year ago.<br> Do you know how long|Lt. Commander Queeg served at sea?<br> - No.|- Queeg has served over eight years.<br> Which of you is better at judging|if a ship is foundering?<br> Myself. When I am in possession of|my faculties and Queeg is not.<br> Describe this loss of faculties. Did|Queeg rave or make insane gestures?<br> No, sir.<br> After being relieved,|did he go crazy?<br> He was never wild or raving. There|are other forms of mental illness.<br> Thank you for your expert opinion.<br> Queeg has been found rational|by three psychiatrists.<br> They weren't there during the storm.<br> - Did you like the captain?|- At first I did.<br> I thought he was incompetent and|unfair. He rode the men too hard.<br> - Yourself included?|- Yes, sir.<br> - You ended up hating Captain Queeg?|- Yes, sir.<br> Let's come to|the morning of 31 July.<br> Did you obey Mr Maryk because|you thought the captain was crazy. -<br> - Or because you hated him?<br> Mr Keith, it's contempt of court|to refuse to answer questions.<br> Mr Maryk did the right thing.<br> No further questions.<br> Mr Keith, have you ever heard|the expression "Old Yellowstain"?<br> - Repeat that, please.|- Old Yellowstain.<br> Yes, sir.|It was a nickname for Captain Queeg.<br> - What did it imply?|- Cowardice.<br> I object. That was an unnecessary|attack on the honour of an officer.<br> The career of an officer with a long|unblemished record is involved here.<br> I warn you, you bear full|responsibility for your conduct.<br> The court will hold in abeyance|to the prosecution's motion.<br> Did that nickname have|anything to do with the typhoon?<br> - No, sir.|- That's all.<br> - No further questions.|- The court has no questions.<br> You may only discuss your testimony|with the parties to the trial.<br> You're excused.<br> You're excused.<br> The ship was rolling bad. Queeg said|to come left, Maryk said right.<br> - Which did you do?|- I obeyed Mr Maryk.<br> - Mr Keith said he'd taken command.|- Did the captain act crazy?<br> - Did Mr Maryk?|- No, sir.<br> Was the captain scared?|Mr Maryk? Was anyone?<br> Just me.|I was plenty scared.<br> - Did you like Captain Queeg?|- I liked him, but not a lot.<br> - He acted strange.|- Because he cleaned up the Caine?<br> Because he made you get haircuts|and was strict about regulations?<br> These were attempts to make good|sailors out of his crew. That's all.<br> - What do those stars represent?|- Well...<br> This silver star is the Coral Sea,|Midway, Guadalcanal...<br> - That's all.|- Call Lt. Thomas Keefer.<br> When did you learn|about Queeg's relief?<br> Mr Maryk called us to the bridge|and told us he had assumed command.<br> Did Captain Queeg look sick?<br> In a typhoon nobody looks very well.<br> Didn't you realise -<br> - The seriousness of Queeg's|warning about collusion in mutiny?<br> - Yes, I did.|- Then why didn't you take action?<br> I wasn't there when he was relieved.<br> I don't know what he did|to convince Mr Maryk he was sick.<br> For the safety of the ship|I obeyed Mr Maryk's order. -<br> - Until higher authority either|endorsed or overruled his action.<br> When Captain Queeg|was in command of the Caine. -<br> - Did you ever observe|any evidence of insanity in him?<br> I can't answer that.|I'm not a psychiatrist.<br> Did you have any reason|to think Queeg might be insane?<br> Prior to 31 July, did Maryk|suspect Queeg of being mentally ill?<br> Yes, sir. Maryk showed me a log|he had written on Queeg's behaviour.<br> Did you believe that log justified|the relief of Captain Queeg?<br> - Well, sir...|- Yes or no?<br> No, sir.<br> Maryk persuaded Mr Keith and me to|go with him to see Admiral Halsey.<br> On board the flagship I told him the|log didn't justify such action. -<br> - And that we'd be charged|with mutiny.<br> Were you surprised|when Maryk relieved the captain?<br> I was flabbergasted.<br> - Were you pleased?|- Maryk was a close friend.<br> I anticipated that he would|be involved in great difficulty.<br> - No further questions.|- No questions.<br> - Will you recall the witness?|- No, sir.<br> - No cross-examination?|- No, sir.<br> - He's lying.|- He'll get you into more trouble.<br> Forget it.|I want one hero, not two mutineers.<br> Call Dr Dixon.<br> Dr Dixon, please.<br> - How did it go, Tom?|- You know. You've tried it.<br> Sure, but you're the old word-king.|You knew what you were doing.<br> Yeah, I knew what I was doing.<br> Doctor, can a sane man possibly|perform offensive or foolish acts?<br> It happens every day.<br> Assuming that the captain's conduct|often showed bad judgement. -<br> - Would that be inconsistent|with your diagnosis of him?<br> No, my colleagues and I didn't find|Captain Queeg a perfect officer.<br> - But we found no mental illness.|- Then he was relieved unjustly?<br> From a psychiatric standpoint, yes.<br> Your witness.<br> My background is legal, not medical.|My questions might be elementary.<br> You said that Lt. Commander Queeg|had problems which he handled well.<br> - Could you describe the problems?|- I object. Queeg is not on trial.<br> The question is irrelevant.<br> Evidence regarding Queeg's mental|make-up is of great importance here.<br> Objection overruled.<br> The doctor may answer.|Repeat the question.<br> You said that Lt. Commander Queeg|had problems which he handled well.<br> Could you describe the problems?<br> The main problem concerns|childhood inferiority feelings. -<br> - Aggravated by adult experiences.<br> - What were those adult experiences?|- He'd undergone a lot of strain.<br> Long, arduous combat duty.|That's all I can say.<br> - Would he easily admit mistakes?|- None of us do.<br> - Would he be a perfectionist?|- Yes.<br> Inclined to hound subordinates|about small details?<br> - Would he find people hostile?|- That's part of the picture.<br> If criticised,|would he feel unjustly persecuted?<br> It all stems from the premise|that he must try to be perfect.<br> You have testified that these|symptoms exist in Queeg's behaviour:<br> Rigidity of personality,|feelings of persecution. -<br> - And a neurotic certainty|he is always right.<br> Isn't there one psychiatric term|for this illness?<br> - I never mentioned any illness.|- Thank you for the correction.<br> What would you call a personality|with all these symptoms?<br> A paranoid personality.|But that is not a disabling illness.<br> - What kind of personality?|- Paranoid.<br> I would like to protest|the counsel's twisting of words.<br> There's a difference between mental|illness and mental disturbance.<br> Could Captain Queeg have been|disabled by the strain of command?<br> - That's absurdly hypothetical.|- Is it?<br> - Have you ever had any sea duty?|- No.<br> Have you ever been at sea?|How long have you been in the Navy?<br> Five months.<br> - Have you ever dealt with captains?|- No.<br> You're no authority on this matter,|and you may be wrong about Queeg.<br> - Your witness.|- One minute, Doctor.<br> The defence|has an interesting point.<br> Did you ever have patients who dealt|with complicated command decisions?<br> - Plant managers, industrialists...|- Quite a few.<br> Including flyers, who deal with|life and death every day.<br> I've written a book on the subject.<br> Could you detect where a neurosis|might damage decision-making?<br> - Absolutely.|- You examined Lt. Commander Queeg.<br> - And you found no such damage?|- That's right.<br> Thank you, Doctor.|That'll be all.<br> - Smart guy.|- He's sure gonna bear down on me.<br> That's the way I saw it.|It was my duty as a naval officer.<br> Captain Queeg was mentally ill|and I had to take over.<br> If I had to do it again,|I'd do it.<br> Thank you, Mr Maryk.|Your witness.<br> Just a few questions. Were|your grades in high school average?<br> - Lower than average.|- And in college?<br> - Are you trained in psychiatry?|- No.<br> Where did you get the idea|that Queeg was mentally ill?<br> Out of books...|I can't remember the titles.<br> - Define schizophrenia.|- I can't.<br> - What's a manic-depressive?|- I don't know.<br> What's the difference between|"paranoid" and "paranoia"?<br> In truth, you don't know|anything about mental illness.<br> - I didn't say I did.|- You knew enough to commit mutiny.<br> - I wanted to save the ship.|- But doctors have found Queeg sane.<br> - They weren't in the ship.|- Isn't the reverse possible?<br> Under pressure, you became erratic|and couldn't understand the captain.<br> Who is presumed by the Navy to have|the best judgement in ship handling?<br> - The captain.|- One last question.<br> If the diagnosis of expert doctors|is correct, then you're guilty?<br> I guess maybe so.<br> - No more questions.|- No further questions.<br> You may step down, Mr Maryk.<br> This is just the first act.|The finale's still to come.<br> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<br> I assumed command of a badly-handled|ship. I tried to bring in into line.<br> Lt. Maryk opposed me|from the first.<br> Maybe he thought I was crazy|to keep trying.<br> Was your ship on the verge of|foundering when you were relieved?<br> A typhoon is an extreme hazard,|but the ship was riding well.<br> Lt. Maryk went into a panic.<br> He believed|only he could save the ship.<br> Ensign Keith, a disloyal officer,|combined with him against me.<br> It was bad luck for them. I bear|them no malice. I'm sorry for them.<br> - No more questions.|- A word of caution, Mr Greenwald.<br> The defence will try to challenge|the competence of Captain Queeg.<br> Nevertheless, all the requirements|of military respect remain in force.<br> During a period|when the Caine was towing targets. -<br> - Did you ever|steam over your own tow line?<br> Objection. The defence outrages|the dignity of this proceeding.<br> The prosecution believes the report|of the psychiatrist closes the case.<br> But it is up to you naval officers|to judge the captain's performance.<br> And I must review that performance.<br> - Objection overruled.|- Did you steam over your tow line?<br> I'm happy to dispose|of this particular slander.<br> When we were towing the target,|I saw some anti-aircraft bursts.<br> - I turned to avoid them.|- You turned in a full circle.<br> My unreliable helmsman|failed to warn me about that.<br> But I saw it and reversed course.|We didn't steam over the tow line.<br> - Did nothing else distract you?|- Not that I recall.<br> Weren't you reprimanding a seaman|for having his shirt-tail out. -<br> - While the ship turned 360 degrees?<br> That only took two seconds.<br> The morning the Caine escorted|attack boats to the beach. -<br> - Did your orders include|dropping a dye marker?<br> - I don't recall.|- Did you drop a dye marker?<br> I don't recall.<br> Didn't you steam ahead of the|attack boats, drop a dye marker -<br> - And retire, leaving the boats|to make the beach on their own?<br> - The question is abusive.|- Cowardice is a serious charge.<br> Sir, may I make one thing clear?<br> It is not the defence's contention|that Commander Queeg is a coward.<br> We assume that no commander of a US|naval ship can possibly be a coward.<br> If he commits questionable acts,|the explanation must be elsewhere.<br> - You may resume your examination.|- Were all your officers disloyal?<br> I didn't say that.|Only some were disloyal.<br> - Mr Keith and Mr Maryk?|- Yes.<br> You wrote this report on Mr Maryk|one month before he relieved you.<br> - Do you recognise it?|- Yes, I do.<br> Please read|your comments on Mr Maryk.<br> The court can't hear you.<br> "This officer|has improved in performance."<br> "He's consistently loyal,|courageous and efficient."<br> "He's recommended|for transfer to the regular navy."<br> Did you turn your ship upside down|searching for a phantom key?<br> I don't know what lies have been|sworn to here, but a key did exist.<br> The witness is understandably|agitated. I request a recess.<br> I don't want a recess.<br> - Did you conduct such a search?|- Yes.<br> My disloyal officers failed me,|and the key couldn't be found.<br> Wasn't this whole fuss|over a quart of strawberries?<br> The pilfering of food is a very|serious occurrence on board a ship.<br> You were told that the mess boys|ate the berries. There was no key.<br> The key was not imaginary. I don't|know anything about the mess boys.<br> Have you no recollection of|a conversation with Ensign Harding?<br> Didn't he tell you that|the mess boys ate the strawberries?<br> I remember he was grateful|for his transfer. His wife was ill.<br> Do you know|where Ensign Harding is now?<br> He's in San Diego. He can be flown|up here in three hours if necessary.<br> - Shall we have him testify?|- No, I...<br> I don't see any need of that.<br> Now that I recall, he might have|said something about mess boys.<br> I questioned many men, and Harding|was not the most reliable officer.<br> The defence has no other recourse|than to produce Ensign Harding.<br> There's no need for that.|He'll only tell you lies.<br> All the officers were disloyal.|They were always fighting me.<br> If the crew wanted their|shirt-tails out, they'd let them.<br> Take the tow line...|defective equipment.<br> But they began spreading wild|rumours about steaming in circles. -<br> - And then "Old Yellowstain". I was|to blame for Maryk's incompetence.<br> Maryk was the perfect officer,|but not Queeg.<br> But the strawberries,|that's where I had them.<br> I proved with geometric logic that a|duplicate key to the icebox existed.<br> I could have produced that key. They|were protecting some officer...<br> Naturally, I can only cover|these things from memory.<br> If I've left anything out,|just ask me specific questions -<br> - And I'll be glad to answer them|one by one.<br> - No further questions, sir.|- The court is closed.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow|for he's a jolly good fellow<br> for he's a jolly good fellow|that nobody can deny.<br> No, baby, there are no girls here.|Just the officers of the Caine.<br> What, darling?|Steve, make them pipe down.<br> - Knock it off, fellas.|- Hi, Tom.<br> Hi, fellas.<br> - Steve.|- Hello, Tom.<br> - I didn't think you dared show up.|- I didn't dare not to.<br> Steve.<br> Thank you for not telling the fellas|about what happened.<br> - I'm delighted about the outcome.|- It's over and done with.<br> You can fly in tonight. We'll|have plenty of time to get married.<br> We'll tell my mother afterwards.|Please, May.<br> I love you, darling.|Goodbye, sweetheart.<br> Steve, Tom, that was May.|We're...<br> Well, well, well. The officers|of the Caine in happy celebration.<br> - You're kind of tight.|- I've got a guilty conscience.<br> I thought the wrong man was on|trial, so I torpedoed Queeg for you.<br> I had to torpedo him.|And I feel sick about it.<br> Take it easy.<br> When I was studying law, and|Mr Keefer was writing his stories. -<br> - And Willie was tearing up|the playing fields of Princeton. -<br> - Who was standing guard|over this country of ours?<br> Not us. We knew you couldn't|make any money in the service.<br> Who did the dirty work for us?|Queeg did, and a lot of other guys.<br> Tough guys|who didn't crack up like Queeg.<br> Queeg endangered|the lives of the men.<br> He didn't endanger any lives.|You did. A fine bunch of officers.<br> - You said yourself he cracked.|- That's a very pretty point.<br> I left out one detail in court.|It wouldn't have helped our case.<br> At one point, Queeg came to you|for help, and you turned him down.<br> Yes, we did.<br> He wasn't worthy of your loyalty.<br> So you turned on him.|You made up songs about him.<br> If you'd been loyal to Queeg, do you|think all this would have come up?<br> I'm asking you, Steve. Would it|have been necessary to take over?<br> It probably|wouldn't have been necessary.<br> - If that's true, we were guilty.|- You're learning.<br> You don't work with the captain|because of his hairstyle. -<br> - But because he's got the job,|or you're no good.<br> The case is over.|You're all safe.<br> It was like|shooting fish in a barrel.<br> Now we come to the man|who should have stood trial.<br> The Shakespeare whose testimony|nearly sunk us all.<br> - Tell them, Keefer.|- You're telling it better.<br> You should read his testimony.|He never even heard of Queeg.<br> - Let's forget it.|- Queeg was sick.<br> But you're real healthy. You didn't|have one tenth the guts he had.<br> - Except I never fooled myself.|- I want to drink a toast to you.<br> You always hated the Navy.|Then you thought up this idea.<br> You managed to keep your skirts nice|and clean even in the court martial.<br> Maryk will be remembered|as a mutineer...<br> You'll publish your novel, make a|million bucks, marry a movie star. -<br> - And live with your conscience.|If you have any.<br> Here's to the real author of|"The Caine Mutiny". Here's to you.<br> I'll be outside. I'm drunker than|you are, so it'll be a fair fight.<br> - Goodbye, darling.|- Goodbye, Willie.<br> Attention on deck.<br> - Keith.|- Yes, sir.<br> - Take her out.|- Aye, aye, sir.<br> Single up all lines!<br> Stand by to cast off!<br>
