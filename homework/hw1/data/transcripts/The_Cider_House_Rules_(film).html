                        In other parts of the world,<br> young men leave home<br> and travel far and wide...<br> in search of a promising future.<br> Their journeys are often fueled<br> by dreams of triumphing over evil,<br> finding a great love...<br> or the hope of fortunes<br> easily made.<br> Here in St. Cloud's, not even<br> the decision to get off<br> the train is easily made,<br> for it requires an earlier,<br> more difficult decision...<br> add a child to your life<br> or leave one behind.<br> The only reason people journey here<br> is for the orphanage.<br> - Good morning.<br> - We have an appointment.<br> Yes. Come in.<br> Welcome to St. Cloud's.<br> We're going right upstairs<br> to see Dr. Larch.<br> I came as a physician<br> to the abandoned children...<br> and unhappily pregnant women.<br> I had hoped to become a hero.<br> But in St. Cloud's,<br> there was no such position.<br> In the lonely, sordid world<br> of lost children,<br> there were no heroes<br> to be found.<br> And so I became the caretaker<br> of many,<br> father of none.<br> Well, in a way,<br> there was one.<br> Here he is.<br> His name<br> was Homer Wells.<br> I named him after<br> the Greek writer.<br> You know, Homer, of course?<br> And I made his name Wells<br> because I could tell he was...<br> very deep.<br> In truth,<br> Nurse Angela named him.<br> Her father drilled wells, and she once<br> owned a cat named Homer.<br> Bye-bye, Homer.<br> - Good night,<br> you Princes of Maine,<br> - Can we see the doctor?<br> You Kings of New England.<br> - Good night.<br> - Doctor?<br> Doctor?<br> There's something wrong with him.<br> - He never makes a sound.<br> - He didn't cry.<br> Orphan babies learn<br> there's no point in it.<br> Do you think we could have a look<br> at someone a little different?<br> Thus was Homer Wells returned.<br> He was too happy a baby.<br> - Bye, Homer.<br> The second<br> family to adopt him had a gift<br> for getting sounds out of Homer.<br> They beat him.<br> He couldn't stop crying.<br> Shh, shh.<br> Shh, shh, shh.<br> It's okay now.<br> Nobody's gonna hurt you<br> anymore.<br> Here in St.<br> Cloud's, I try to consider with<br> each rule I make or break...<br> that my first priority<br> is an orphan's future.<br> Twice adopted,<br> twice returned.<br> It didn't bode well.<br> And yet it was always clear to<br> me that he was a special boy.<br> Near the angle of the rib. And...<br> - It was with<br> Homer's future in mind...<br> - Homer?<br> - That I began his tutorials.<br> - If you're going to stay at St. Cloud's,<br> I expect you to be of use.<br> I admit<br> that our lessons were, in part,<br> - the simple expression<br> of a father's love.<br> - Homer.<br> But in failing to<br> withhold love...<br> and making the orphanage<br> his home,<br> had I created a true<br> and everlasting orphan?<br> - No!<br> - Keep breathing. You're gonna be okay.<br> And so my<br> excellent pupil learned to look<br> after abandoned children...<br> - and to deliver unwanted babies.<br> - Relax!<br> Long ago, I had decided<br> that sometimes...<br> it was the women<br> who needed to be delivered.<br> I chose my own path.<br> No one would ever choose<br> for Homer Wells.<br> Dr. Larch!<br> Dr. Larch!<br> Dr. Larch?<br> We have two new patients.<br> - One to deliver.<br> - Coming.<br> - First pregnancy?<br> - Yes, for both.<br> I presume you'd prefer<br> handling the delivery?<br> All I said was,<br> I don't wanna perform abortions.<br> I have no argument<br> with you performing them.<br> You know how to help these women.<br> How can you not feel obligated...<br> to help them when they can't<br> get help anywhere else?<br> One: It's illegal. Two: I didn't ask<br> how to do it. You just showed me.<br> What else could I have shown<br> you, Homer? The only thing<br> I can teach you is what I know.<br> In any life,<br> you have to be of use.<br> Of use? Of use.<br> That was good, Carla. That was perfect.<br> Everything's gonna be fine.<br> - I don't wanna see it.<br> - You don't have to see it, dear.<br> Don't worry.<br> I don't even wanna know<br> what sex it is, so don't tell me!<br> - We won't tell you.<br> You're gonna be okay.<br> - Your baby's gonna be okay too.<br> - I don't wanna know!<br> - That's a big boy.<br> Let me see him.<br> I wanna see him.<br> - Would you mind joining me<br> in the nursery?<br> - Okay.<br> Wilbur, the adopting couple<br> is waiting in your office.<br> Life is waiting.<br> Let 'em wait.<br> Where's the name sheet?<br> Uh, nobody's named<br> this one yet.<br> Oh, it's my turn. Henceforth,<br> you shall be Little Dorrit.<br> Oh.<br> No, you don't like that,<br> do you?<br> He's a boy, that's why.<br> Can't a boy be a Dorrit?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - You do it.<br> Okay.<br> Henceforth,<br> you shall be Little Wilbur.<br> I'm not crazy about<br> the "Little."<br> Okay, just Wilbur then.<br> We haven't had a Wilbur in a year or so,<br> have we? We used to have dozens.<br> He sniffs that ether.<br> I've seen him do it.<br> It's because he's too tired<br> to sleep. He has to.<br> He smells like he could<br> put you to sleep.<br> He's a doctor, Buster.<br> Doctors smell like ether.<br> - You're a doctor, Homer.<br> You don't smell like ether.<br> - I'm not a doctor.<br> I haven't been to medical school.<br> I haven't even been to high school.<br> - But you've studied<br> with the old man for years.<br> - I'm not a doctor.<br> I'm sorry, Homer.<br> Fuzzy is not uncommon.<br> There's something about the premature<br> babies of alcoholic mothers.<br> They seem to be susceptible to every<br> damn thing that comes along.<br> I haven't read that.<br> I haven't either,<br> but you will.<br> Those morons who write the books<br> ought to do some research here.<br> Isn't Fuzzy just<br> underdeveloped?<br> When doesn't<br> he have bronchitis?<br> I wouldn't call his bronchial<br> infection underdeveloped, would you?<br> Come on, Fuzz.<br> Here we go. Feet up.<br> There you are.<br> - What's going on here?<br> - Sit up straight.<br> Wilbur? Wilbur, can you<br> come out here, please?<br> There you go.<br> - Hi, Homer.<br> - Hey. What is it, Mary Agnes?<br> Now calm down.<br> - What is it?<br> - Look.<br> Oh. Uh, did you bite it?<br> - Did you bite your tongue?<br> - I don't remember.<br> Uh, yeah. That looks like you bit it.<br> You'll be fine.<br> Well, maybe I was kissing<br> someone and he bit me.<br> Oh, I think you bit it. Maybe<br> in your sleep. Story time, Fuzzy.<br> O Lord, support us<br> all the day long...<br> until the shadows lengthen<br> and the evening comes...<br> and the busy world is hushed<br> and the fever of life is over...<br> and our work is done.<br> Then in Thy mercy,<br> - grant us a safe lodging<br> and a holy rest...<br> And peace at the last.<br> - Amen.<br> - Amen.<br> "A dog, which had lain<br> concealed till now...<br> "ran backwards and forwards<br> on the parapet...<br> "with a dismal howl.<br> "And collecting himself<br> for a spring,<br> "jumped for<br> the dead man's shoulders.<br> "Missing his aim,<br> he fell into a ditch...<br> "turning completely over<br> as he went...<br> "and striking his head<br> against the stone,<br> dashed out his brains."<br> - And that...<br> - Is the end of the chapter.<br> That's it till tomorrow.<br> Good night,<br> you Princes of Maine,<br> you Kings of New England.<br> Good night,<br> Princes of Maine, Kings of New England.<br> Whoa.<br> John, you all right?<br> Why does Dr. Larch<br> say that every night?<br> - Maybe to scare us.<br> - No, you jerk.<br> Dr. Larch loves us.<br> But why does he do that?<br> - Does it because we like it.<br> - Do you like it, Curly?<br> Yeah.<br> I like it too.<br> Watch the door.<br> You two get Copperfield<br> and Curly. Buster's mine.<br> - And remember, nobody touches Fuzzy.<br> - Attack!<br> Hey!<br> - Ow!<br> - Ouch.<br> What do you think<br> you're doing?<br> Children, stop it. No fighting.<br> Share the snowballs.<br> Fuzzy. Fuzzy.<br> Listen to you.<br> You've been running.<br> Hey, over here!<br> Look! Pick me!<br> I know the type.<br> They'll take one of the babies.<br> Mary Agnes.<br> Come here.<br> Don't run.<br> Fuzzy.<br> Curly.<br> John.<br> Hazel.<br> Andy.<br> They wanted a girl,<br> Curly.<br> Nobody ever wants me.<br> Oh, hey.<br> Hey, come on.<br> Come here.<br> You know, you're one<br> of the best, Curly.<br> And we wouldn't let<br> just anyone take you.<br> Dr. Larch wouldn't let<br> just anyone take any of us.<br> Well, that's true.<br> - Nobody's asked for me, have they?<br> - Nobody special enough, Curly.<br> You mean somebody has?<br> Only the right people<br> can have you.<br> Now what do you say<br> we go unpack your suitcase?<br> - It's movie night tonight, Curly.<br> - Okay.<br> Look. Kong thinks<br> she's his mother.<br> - His mother?<br> - He thinks she's his mother.<br> - He doesn't think<br> she's his mother, Fuzzy.<br> - He does so. He loves her.<br> - That's why he holds her.<br> - Shh, Fuzzy.<br> Fuzzy, how can she<br> be his mother?<br> He just thinks she is.<br> They want to replace me.<br> The board of trustees<br> wants to replace me.<br> They just want you<br> to hire some new help.<br> We don't need any more help.<br> Some new things would be useful.<br> - Yuck!<br> Aw, come on.<br> - Homer, I need you.<br> - Happens every time.<br> Kong, Kong, Kong,<br> Kong, Kong, Kong!<br> Thought you'd taken care of this.<br> Always breaks in the same place.<br> - It's your splice, isn't it?<br> - No, it is your splice.<br> You blame me for everything.<br> Angela, we need a new movie,<br> a new projector, a new typewriter.<br> That's what needs replacing<br> around here.<br> - Wilbur, we have a delivery.<br> - Homer, would you get this one?<br> She's a patient, right?<br> She should see a doctor.<br> Homer, you are a skilled<br> and gifted surgeon...<br> with near perfect obstetrical<br> and gynecological procedure.<br> I just mean that I'd rather<br> fix the movie tonight.<br> Okay, sure.<br> You splice,<br> I'll deliver.<br> Come on, Fuzz.<br> Let's go. Let go. Come on.<br> Homer, doesn't King Kong<br> think the woman is his mother?<br> - That's right, Fuzz.<br> That's what Kong thinks.<br> - That's why Kong loves her.<br> It's your turn.<br> I'll get this.<br> Okay.<br> Story time!<br> The Personal History<br> of David Copperfield.<br> Chapter one.<br> "I am born."<br> "Whether I shall turn out to be<br> the hero of my own life...<br> "or whether that station will be held<br> by anybody else, these pages must show.<br> "I was a posthumous child.<br> - "My father's eyes had closed<br> upon the light of this world...<br> Six months<br> when mine opened on it."<br> His father's dead, right?<br> That's right, Fuzz.<br> Is your father dead?<br> Cirrhosis.<br> It's a disease of the liver.<br> What, a liver killed him?<br> No, alcohol killed him.<br> He drank himself to death.<br> - But did you know him?<br> - Barely.<br> But it hardly mattered<br> that I knew him.<br> - Did you know your mother better?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> She's dead now too.<br> She was a nanny.<br> What's a nanny do?<br> She looks after<br> other people's children.<br> - Did she grow up around here?<br> - No.<br> - She was an immigrant.<br> - What's an immigrant?<br> Someone not from Maine.<br> Let us be happy for Hazel.<br> Hazel has found a family.<br> Good night, Hazel.<br> Good night, Hazel.<br> I was dreaming about you.<br> How beautiful you were.<br> - Ah, you weren't.<br> - I was.<br> - And I was beautiful?<br> - You were.<br> You are.<br> It was fantastic.<br> It was just the ether,<br> Wilbur.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey, Eddie, look at this.<br> - Homer, do you ever think about<br> trying to find your parents?<br> - Not really.<br> Why not?<br> Well, they never did the things<br> parents are supposed to do.<br> Dr. Larch did those things<br> and Nurse Edna and Nurse Angela.<br> Well, I wish I could<br> meet mine anyway, sometimes.<br> What for?<br> Well, I'd like to show 'em<br> that I could cook a little.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - And...<br> that I could drive a truck.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Sometimes I wanna meet them so I can<br> kill them. Just sort of kill them.<br> You know I'd never<br> kill anyone, right?<br> - Mm-hmm. I know.<br> - Get away!<br> Get the hell off of me!<br> I think Mary Agnes<br> could kill someone.<br> - What the hell do you<br> think you're doing?<br> - I don't think so.<br> No, she's... she's just<br> an emotional girl.<br> What's she so emotional about?<br> She got left here<br> like the rest of us, didn't she?<br> Throw it to Copperfield.<br> I go first.<br> I'll be on Buster's team.<br> Look!<br> Her temperature is 104.<br> Scoot down.<br> Come on. Good girl.<br> That's a girl. Little more.<br> Dear child, it won't hurt when I look.<br> I'm just gonna look.<br> All right.<br> Dear child, did you, uh,<br> do something to yourself?<br> It wasn't me.<br> It wasn't me.<br> - Did you go to someone else?<br> - He said he was a doctor.<br> - I would never have stuck that<br> inside of me. It wasn't me.<br> - Listen, you've been very brave.<br> - I'm going to put you to sleep.<br> - It wasn't me.<br> Homer, I want you<br> to see this.<br> You won't feel it any more.<br> You've been very brave.<br> We'll make it deep.<br> - You sure?<br> - You bet.<br> The fetus is unexpelled.<br> Her uterus is punctured.<br> She has acute peritonitis,<br> and there's a foreign object.<br> I think it's a crochet hook.<br> Take this.<br> If she had come to you four months ago<br> and asked for a simple D&C,<br> what would you have done?<br> Nothing!<br> This is what doing nothing gets you.<br> It means that somebody else<br> is gonna do the job, some moron<br> who doesn't know how.<br> I wish you'd have<br> come to me, dear child.<br> What did she die of?<br> She died of secrecy.<br> - She died of ignorance.<br> - Oh.<br> Homer, if you expect people to be<br> responsible for their children,<br> you have to give them the right to<br> decide whether or not to have children.<br> - Wouldn't you agree?<br> - How about expecting people<br> to be responsible enough...<br> to control themselves<br> to begin with?<br> How about this child?<br> You expect her to be responsible?<br> I'm not talking about her.<br> I'm talking about adults.<br> You know who I mean.<br> - What?<br> - It's just... It's just a marvel to me...<br> that you still have such<br> high expectations of people.<br> - I'm happy I amuse you.<br> - Look at it this way.<br> What choice does Buster have?<br> What are his options?<br> - Nobody will ever adopt him.<br> - Look at it this way.<br> Buster and I are sitting here<br> right beside you. We could have<br> ended up in the incinerator.<br> Happy to be alive under any<br> circumstances. Is that your point?<br> Happy to be alive?<br> Yeah, I guess so.<br> - You're it.<br> - Pass it over here.<br> - So many children.<br> Are they all orphans?<br> - Well, it is an orphanage.<br> - Who wants chocolate?<br> - I want some chocolate.<br> Hi. Okay.<br> They're getting in the car.<br> Watch your fingers.<br> Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - I'm the best.<br> - You are?<br> Wow! The best?<br> The best at what?<br> - I'm the best one.<br> - The best one, huh?<br> - I'm the best one of all the kids.<br> - You are?<br> He seems like<br> the best one.<br> Well, let's see if we can take care<br> of that. Can you blow?<br> I really am the best.<br> I just have a cold.<br> Sorry. They're not used<br> to seeing a car like this.<br> Ah, it's okay.<br> I don't mind.<br> Come on.<br> Come on. Let's get out.<br> Come on now.<br> - Oh, sure you can. Come on.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Morning.<br> - Dr. Larch.<br> - Candy.<br> - Hi, I'm Wally. I brought<br> some chocolates for the kids.<br> Chocolates? How thoughtful.<br> Come on, Curly.<br> - So, Mrs...<br> - Candy.<br> Candy Kendall.<br> Wally. Wally Worthington.<br> How many months are you?<br> - Uh, two.<br> - Two.<br> Um...<br> Are you... Are you the...<br> Are you doing the...<br> Oh, no. Dr. Larch will be<br> performing the procedure.<br> - Oh, good.<br> - Okay.<br> I was...<br> I was just curious.<br> Excuse me.<br> The woman you delivered last night,<br> she's complaining of pain.<br> Okay. I'll take a look.<br> Couple of minutes. Thank you.<br> Are you okay?<br> Yeah. I think<br> it was the ether.<br> Oh, the... That smell<br> must've got to me.<br> Oh, God,<br> this is all my fault.<br> Homer, Steerforth got into the pantry.<br> He's eaten all the pie dough.<br> - He wasn't sharing it either.<br> - He's down the hall throwing up.<br> - He's such a pig.<br> - Don't call him a pig. It's<br> not nice to call people names.<br> But he is a pig.<br> What kind of planes<br> do you fly in?<br> A B- 24 Liberator.<br> Oh. Liberator.<br> You enlisted?<br> They wouldn't take me. I'm Class 4.<br> I have a heart defect.<br> - Yeah? Is it serious?<br> - No.<br> No, it's not serious.<br> I'm just not supposed to get excited.<br> You know, no strain, no stress.<br> I try to keep calm all the time.<br> I can't imagine there's<br> any strain or stress around here.<br> Yeah.<br> - How she's doing?<br> - Just fine.<br> Good.<br> Boy or a girl?<br> - It's all over, dear.<br> - Yeah, it's all over, honey.<br> I would really like<br> to have a baby one day.<br> - I really would.<br> - Why, of course.<br> You can have as<br> many children as you want.<br> - I'm sure you'll have<br> very beautiful children.<br> - Oh, yes, I'm sure. I'm sure.<br> You'll have Princes of Maine.<br> You'll have Kings of New England.<br> Lieutenant, I think you should<br> find yourself some fresh air.<br> - I still don't feel so good.<br> - Cut it out, children.<br> Homer, what's a runt?<br> Copperfield called me a runt.<br> He was just kidding, Fuzz.<br> - Here.<br> - Orange is my favorite color.<br> Should I keep<br> the teeth orange?<br> Homer, look.<br> Homer, look, look.<br> Homer, when is Halloween?<br> - It's at the end of October.<br> - Is that soon?<br> That's a few months away, Fuzz.<br> Oh, it's the best time.<br> Homer?<br> - What is Honolulu?<br> - Honolulu?<br> Hmm. It's a city.<br> Oh. What's the moonlight like?<br> Well, I've never been there,<br> - but I think that it would<br> probably be very bright.<br> - Oh.<br> Why do we get pumpkins<br> only once a year?<br> Don't get too excited,<br> Fuzzy.<br> Eeew, that's disgusting!<br> He does this all the time.<br> Stop it right now.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey. How's she doin'?<br> - Oh, she's fine.<br> - Good.<br> Fine.<br> I... I was wondering<br> if you could give me a ride?<br> Sure.<br> I'd be glad to.<br> Uh, a ride where?<br> Where you goin'?<br> We're headin' back<br> to Cape Kenneth.<br> Cape Kenneth?<br> That sounds fine.<br> Okay.<br> Doubtless you will let me know<br> what immensely worthwhile...<br> or at least useful thing<br> that it is you find to do.<br> I wasn't intending to leave here<br> to be entirely useless.<br> I expect I'll find some<br> other way to be of use.<br> - In other parts of the world,<br> I suppose there are other ways.<br> - Of course.<br> Are you so stupid you imagine you're<br> going to find a more gratifying life?<br> What you will find is people<br> like the poor people who get left here.<br> Only nobody takes care of them<br> half as well. You won't be able<br> to take care of them either.<br> There's no taking care<br> of anybody, not out there.<br> You know I'm grateful for everything<br> that you've done for me.<br> - I don't need your gratitude.<br> - I don't need this.<br> I know all about my condition.<br> It's your heart.<br> You ought to take it with you.<br> Going where?<br> Does he have a plan of some kind?<br> - Will he be back soon?<br> - I don't know. He's just leaving.<br> You were the one who says<br> he needs to see the world.<br> - That's what he'll do, is see the world.<br> - He's leaving.<br> - He'll need clothes.<br> He'll need some money.<br> - Let him try to make some money.<br> That's part of seeing<br> the world, isn't it?<br> Oh, Wilbur, stop it. You knew this was<br> going to happen. He's a young man.<br> He's still a boy.<br> Out in the world,<br> he's still a boy.<br> Just find him some clothes,<br> Wilbur.<br> He could use some clothes.<br> Homer.<br> Copperfield.<br> It'll be all right.<br> Children,<br> up on the porch. Up, up.<br> Say goodbye.<br> Wave from here.<br> - Bye. Bye.<br> - Bye, Homer.<br> Bye, Homer.<br> Come on.<br> - I can walk. Put me down.<br> - Nope. I wanna carry you.<br> - No, it's okay.<br> - Here, let me get this.<br> Wally, put me down.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Hey.<br> Coming with us?<br> That's good.<br> You never know when<br> you're gonna need a doctor.<br> - Do you want me to put the top up?<br> - No.<br> - You might get cold.<br> - I want some fresh air.<br> She'll be just fine.<br> Is he gonna come out?<br> - Bye, Homer.<br> - Bye, Curly.<br> Sorry I have to go.<br> It's not fair.<br> You're too old.<br> I couldn't find Buster.<br> Maybe you could tell him that I...<br> - Bye, Homer!<br> - Don't go too far!<br> Homer, bye!<br> Hey, Homer!<br> Let us be happy<br> for Homer Wells.<br> Homer has found a family.<br> Aren't we all happy<br> for Homer?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good night, Homer.<br> Good night, Homer.<br> Good night, Homer.<br> Actually, the army's<br> given me leave twice.<br> First, when my father died.<br> And now I'm on leave to help<br> my mom with the harvest.<br> She's no farmer.<br> Apples were my dad's business,<br> but with the war on<br> she's short of pickers.<br> - Wally thinks apples are boring.<br> - I never said they were boring.<br> Yes, you did. You said apples<br> weren't exactly flying.<br> - They aren't.<br> - I think I would like<br> the apple business.<br> - You're a little overqualified,<br> aren't you?<br> - No.<br> - No, not really. I need a job.<br> - Where are you headed?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> I don't know.<br> Is your family in<br> the apple business too, Candy?<br> No. But I work there.<br> I like it.<br> My dad's a lobster man.<br> - Oh, wow.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> I've never actually seen<br> a lobster.<br> Are you serious?<br> I've never seen<br> the ocean either.<br> You... You've never<br> seen the ocean?<br> That's not funny.<br> That's serious.<br> It's beautiful.<br> Yeah.<br> Do you have cramps?<br> They'll ease up soon.<br> As long as the bleeding<br> isn't heavy, it's normal,<br> it should taper<br> off tomorrow.<br> Catch!<br> All right.<br> - Throw it back.<br> - Okay.<br> All right!<br> - Put your fingers on the laces.<br> Here's China.<br> Here's India.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Seven-hour round trip flight.<br> It's called the "Burma run."<br> And this part's called " Flying over<br> the hump." These are the Himalayas.<br> How high do you fly there?<br> Well, I have to fly 15,000 feet<br> within the first 35 minutes.<br> Otherwise we won't make it<br> over the first mountain.<br> - They got the worst<br> air currents in the world.<br> - Dangerous, huh?<br> Yeah. Actually,<br> I volunteered.<br> Did you really?<br> Hey, look. If you're serious<br> about wanting a job, picking<br> apples isn't that boring.<br> Yeah? Oh, I would<br> love that, Wally.<br> - See you around, Homer.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - Thank you, for everything.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Hi, Sam.<br> Hi, Dad!<br> Come on.<br> You're gonna meet my mom.<br> By the way, I've been<br> at a wedding, all right?<br> If it comes up, that's where<br> I met you, at the wedding.<br> Wally?<br> Wally, is that you?<br> Mom, this is Homer Wells.<br> - How do you do, Homer?<br> - Oh, good. How do you do?<br> He's the most overqualified<br> apple picker you'll ever meet,<br> but he's dying to learn.<br> Really? Were you a friend<br> of the groom's, Homer?<br> Homer's a friend of the groom's,<br> the bride's, everyone. Come on.<br> In that case, maybe you'd<br> like to stay to dinner, Homer?<br> Another time, Mom.<br> You gotta meet Mr. Rose.<br> You used up<br> all the hot water!<br> - You're usin' my soap, ain't you?<br> - I ain't usin' no soap.<br> They're migrants.<br> They pick the fruit.<br> All kinds.<br> They travel up and down<br> the coast with the seasons.<br> The trick to Mr. Rose<br> is you have to let him be boss.<br> Oh, excuse me.<br> - The sink's backed up again, Wally.<br> - Not again.<br> - Thought you said you was<br> gonna get us a plumber.<br> - Rose, this is Homer.<br> - Homer, this is<br> Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose.<br> - You a plumber?<br> Homer's the new picker.<br> He's gonna stay here with you.<br> - He's stayin' here?<br> - Yeah.<br> Uh-oh.<br> This daughter of mine, she's just Miss<br> Hospitality, ain't she, Wally?<br> New picker?<br> You got lots of experience, I expect.<br> Homer's got no experience,<br> Arthur,<br> but he's smarter than I am<br> and he's a fast learner.<br> Mr. Rose is gonna teach you<br> the apple business.<br> Well, I believe<br> this is history.<br> We're makin' history,<br> Wally, ain't we?<br> We're makin' history<br> havin' this young man stay with us.<br> - Why don't you<br> show him around?<br> Your name is Rose Rose?<br> - Pretty, ain't it?<br> - Very.<br> - You like to read?<br> - I really can't read that good.<br> Homer, what does<br> this say? Here.<br> "I looked at the stars<br> and considered...<br> "how awful it would be for a man<br> to turn his face to them...<br> "and he froze to death<br> and see no help or pity...<br> in all<br> the glittering multitude."<br> More.<br> - Since you the one...<br> who's smart enough to read,<br> what's this here?<br> - It's a list of rules it seems.<br> - Whose rules?<br> I imagine they're for us,<br> I suppose.<br> Go on then.<br> Read 'em, Homer.<br> "One: Please don't smoke in bed.<br> It's too late for that one.<br> Keep reading, Homer.<br> Two: Please don't operate the grinder<br> or press if you've been drinking."<br> You know, they ain't<br> our rules, Homer.<br> We didn't write 'em.<br> I don't see no need to read 'em.<br> Okay.<br> Good night,<br> you Princes of Maine,<br> you Kings of New England.<br> Hoo! Remember this.<br> In the morning when the grass<br> is wet, you can make it slide.<br> - Feel it?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's almost like flying.<br> Watch out for the trees.<br> Trees are flak,<br> antiaircraft fire...<br> from the geeks<br> on the ground.<br> - Hey, Homer.<br> - Hi.<br> I was just showin' Homer<br> the orchard.<br> - Kind of a geography lesson.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What's that?<br> - What?<br> - This, here. Looks like you've<br> been giving him flying lessons.<br> Ah, he loved it.<br> Didn't you?<br> Wally here thinks people<br> like being whacked by branches.<br> - Oh, I liked it.<br> - Really?<br> Yeah!<br> - You're unbelievable.<br> - Well, thank you very much.<br> Hey!<br> What's wrong with you?<br> Sorry.<br> That's Vernon. You better stay away from<br> him till he gets to know you better.<br> - Then you best stay away<br> from him even more.<br> - Homer.<br> Lieutenant's calling you.<br> You better watch your ass, Homer.<br> Hey, Wally.<br> - You gettin' along okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Guess what.<br> - What?<br> I'm shippin' out today.<br> It's a little sooner<br> than I expected, but...<br> I wanted to make sure that you're<br> settled and happy enough considering...<br> Are you bored stiff or do you think<br> you can stick it out a bit?<br> Yeah, of course.<br> I'm grateful for the job, Wally.<br> I'm grateful too. It gives me<br> peace of mind knowin' you're<br> here keepin' an eye on things.<br> - Well, that's good.<br> - You about ready, Homer?<br> Yeah.<br> - Uh, look, Wally, thanks.<br> I'm lucky I met you.<br> - I'm the lucky one.<br> - No, really, I'm lucky.<br> - Do you wanna fight about it?<br> - Kidding.<br> - Oh, okay.<br> - Take care of yourself.<br> - Okay.<br> Bye.<br> Okay, Mr. Rose.<br> Turn. That's right.<br> Turn and pull.<br> Turn and pull.<br> Just like that. Good. Good.<br> Okay, that's good. Right now<br> you're pickin' mostly cider apples.<br> All these drops here,<br> they good only for cider.<br> And you're picking apples with<br> the stem only half the time.<br> Golden rule, Homer. You wanna<br> pick the apple with the stem.<br> Now, see that there?<br> The spur right above the stem?<br> That's the bud for next year's apple.<br> That's called the "spur."<br> Pick the spur,<br> you're pickin' two years in one.<br> You're pickin' next year's apple<br> before it have a chance to grow.<br> So you wanna leave that.<br> - Okay.<br> - All right, let me see you work.<br> Yeah. That's good.<br> Yeah, that's much better.<br> That's better.<br> I can see you got yourself<br> some education.<br> Them good hands you got.<br> Them hands you got, they know<br> what they're doin'. Ain't that right?<br> - I guess so.<br> - All right.<br> - You keep on workin', Homer.<br> I'll be right back.<br> - Okay.<br> Wilbur? Wilbur?<br> Wilbur?<br> You should read this.<br> It's from the board.<br> Another letter.<br> "Merely suggesting that some new blood<br> might benefit you all.<br> Someone with new ideas in<br> the obstetrical and pediatric fields."<br> I think they're just testing some ideas<br> for our next meeting.<br> Dr. Holtz seems nice.<br> I think he only wants to help.<br> He's a goddamn psychiatrist!<br> Of course he wants to help.<br> He'd be happy to help<br> to commit me.<br> It's this Mrs. Goodhall<br> you have to be careful of, Wilbur.<br> We have to be more<br> than careful of Mrs. Goodhall.<br> She has enough Christian zeal<br> to start her own country.<br> I'd like to give her<br> a little ether.<br> - So, what are you going to do?<br> - Take this.<br> Homer Wells, born<br> Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915.<br> But Homer<br> was born here.<br> - In what was it? 1922?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Graduated Bowdoin College,<br> 1935.<br> Harvard School of Medicine,<br> - That's you, Wilbur. You went there.<br> - An internship,<br> and two years of training at<br> the Boston Lying-In, South End Branch,<br> he was judged an accomplished<br> gynecological...<br> - and obstetrical surgeon...<br> - That's not him.<br> With experience<br> in pediatric care.<br> Wilbur, you're making<br> this up.<br> Angela, the board<br> is going to replace me.<br> That is what<br> the new blood is for.<br> You mean they're going to<br> replace you with someone<br> who doesn't perform abortions.<br> Well, we can only guess at that.<br> They are against the law.<br> These credentials<br> are against the law.<br> We all know I trained Homer, so his<br> credentials are as good as mine.<br> And don't be holy to me<br> about the law.<br> What has the law ever done<br> for anyone here?<br> So, what do you think<br> about my candidate?<br> What about school records?<br> Homer doesn't have any diplomas.<br> Come here, Edna, please.<br> Come here.<br> He will have them.<br> Wilbur!<br> I don't know...<br> All of these on there, okay.<br> - Gotta pack 'em tight now, y'all.<br> - I got it.<br> What do you think we do?<br> - All aboard, Mrs. Worthington.<br> - Thank you, Arthur.<br> How's this crew this year?<br> Got any rotten apples?<br> - It's a good crew, ma'am.<br> - Hey, Rose Rose.<br> - You tryin' to break my finger? Damn!<br> - Just an accident.<br> Excuse me.<br> Well, maybe we got one bad apple,<br> but it's nothing we can't handle.<br> I see.<br> How's young Homer<br> working out?<br> - Good. He's a smart young man.<br> - Hey, Homer.<br> - Wally was right about him.<br> Real hard worker.<br> - Good.<br> Mornin', Miss Worthington.<br> Why don't you come up and visit<br> me at the house? I know I've<br> got clothes that will fit you.<br> - Okay.<br> - I'm sure I can find<br> a ton of things to fit you.<br> Rose don't really need<br> any more pickin' clothes, ma'am.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Now don't be a party-pooper, Arthur.<br> I have<br> a beautiful blouse...<br> - Hey, Rose Rose.<br> - Homer.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> How you feelin'?<br> When I'm not thinking<br> of Wally, I'm fine.<br> I'm not really good<br> at being alone.<br> Oh.<br> Feeling much better.<br> Thanks.<br> Hey, listen.<br> Maybe if you're free, you'd like to come<br> and have dinner at my dad's place?<br> - Okay.<br> - You haven't seen<br> a lobster yet, have you?<br> - No.<br> - Oh, good.<br> You're hungry, right?<br> - What is that?<br> - It's a drive-in<br> movie theatre.<br> - It's a movie outside?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, can we see it?<br> - Okay.<br> - It's closed now<br> because of the blackouts.<br> - Oh.<br> It's so big.<br> You smoke?<br> You want a cigarette?<br> Okay.<br> Wally would kill me<br> if he saw me doin' this.<br> - There you go.<br> - Thanks.<br> So, you like movies?<br> Yes. Seen only one, though.<br> You've seen only one?<br> Which one?<br> Uh, King Kong.<br> It's really good.<br> Mmm. Oh.<br> Wilbur, it's a pie apple. Here, look.<br> See? Try one of those.<br> So he's an apple expert now,<br> is he?<br> Oh, my, yes.<br> That's a far superior taste.<br> And crisp too.<br> So many apples<br> are disappointingly mealy.<br> Wilbur, he picked these<br> for us himself.<br> You don't find it depressing<br> that Homer Wells is picking apples?<br> Or that he can't be bothered<br> to write us a proper letter?<br> Wilbur, it's a gift.<br> I'll show him a gift.<br> I'll send him a gift<br> he can use.<br> There goes<br> Jimmy Stewart on his way to enlist.<br> One of the most popular<br> stars on the screen.<br> Today he's Lieutenant Stewart,<br> U.S.A.<br> Crossing the equator, there's a lighter<br> side, as novices are introduced...<br> to the traditional realm<br> of King Neptune.<br> Boxing matches, helping relieve<br> the monotony of long, weary days at sea.<br> Well, it looked<br> like you liked it.<br> I did like it. All I said was,<br> it's no King Kong.<br> I mean, first she loved him,<br> then she didn't. Then no one<br> else could have him.<br> No, but she did love him.<br> How many women have you known?<br> And what did she<br> die of exactly?<br> She was torn apart.<br> She died of a broken heart.<br> Oh. Well, I just...<br> I need a better<br> medical explanation.<br> Torn apart. At least King Kong,<br> he knew what he wanted.<br> Hey, what you doin'<br> with that Candy, Homer?<br> Makin' history, I suppose.<br> - You ain't gettin'<br> in no trouble, I hope.<br> - No trouble.<br> That Candy, she's<br> the nicest girl I know.<br> She's about the most beautiful<br> girl I've ever seen, but I<br> don't know if she's the nicest.<br> She's the nicest and most beautiful<br> girl I've ever known.<br> See, that sounds like<br> you in trouble already, Homer.<br> Sounds like big trouble<br> to me, Homer.<br> - I'm not in trouble.<br> - Yeah, you is.<br> I know when people<br> are in trouble.<br> You is.<br> His name is Homer Wells,<br> and his pathetic resume<br> is the best I've seen.<br> I find it hard to believe that the board<br> would be interested in this character.<br> But he looks like<br> an excellent young man.<br> A first-rate candidate.<br> Don't you think?<br> He looks like a bleeding<br> heart missionary moron to me.<br> But that would be the problem with any<br> doctor interested in coming here.<br> - Do you know him?<br> - No, and I don't want to.<br> He's doing missionary work<br> in India.<br> I wrote to him weeks ago, but either<br> he's too holy or too busy to answer.<br> Tomboy!<br> Sorry. Okay.<br> Come on.<br> I fail to see how someone<br> courageous enough...<br> to make a commitment<br> to a foreign mission is<br> automatically to be dismissed.<br> That part of the world requires<br> precisely the kind of dedication<br> that is needed here.<br> Does it snow in Bombay?<br> One winter here and we'll be<br> shipping him south in a coffin!<br> But Dr. Larch, he seems<br> exceptionally qualified.<br> I'm not talking about<br> his medical qualifications.<br> It's the Christian thing that<br> bothers me. I just don't see it<br> as being much use around here.<br> I fail to see how a little Christianity<br> could hurt anyone here.<br> Anyway, I was just showing<br> you this guy as an example...<br> of what's available.<br> - I didn't think you'd be interested.<br> - We're very interested.<br> - Oh, yes, very.<br> - You wouldn't be opposed<br> to meeting with him?<br> Well, it wouldn't hurt<br> to meet him.<br> - What's his name again?<br> - Dr. Homer Wells.<br> - It's a nice name. Very New England.<br> - Very Maine.<br> A very<br> local sounding name.<br> Very.<br> I told you.<br> If I appear to want it,<br> they don't want it.<br> If I appear to hate it, they just<br> gotta have it.<br> - Excuse me. I just wanna<br> ask you something.<br> - Edna, come dance with me.<br> Let's be foolish tonight.<br> Come on.<br> Does he know he's supposed<br> to be in India? Does he<br> even want to come back?<br> He's a field hand!<br> What could possibly<br> hold him there?<br> Homer!<br> It's time to go!<br> - Oh, I gotta go.<br> - Okay.<br> Right now, we're usin' them<br> early Macs and Gravensteins.<br> Cider is way too watery, man.<br> We ain't gonna get no good cider...<br> till we start pickin' them<br> Golden Delicious and Winter Bananas...<br> and Russets and Baldwins,<br> you know.<br> What about worms?<br> Don't the drops have worms?<br> Well, yeah, they got worms, Homer.<br> That ain't nothin' but protein, man.<br> Jack?<br> What the hell<br> is you doin', man?<br> Don't you know that cigarette's<br> gonna ruin this whole batch<br> of cider? I can't have that.<br> You gonna have to get that out of there.<br> You're gonna have to go fishin', boy.<br> - You mean swimmin'?<br> - Swimmin' or fishin'.<br> I ain't goin' in that vat<br> to fish out no cigarette.<br> Now, Jack...<br> Come on down here,<br> man.<br> What business<br> are you in, Jack?<br> Just tell me<br> what business you're in.<br> Just say you're in the<br> apple business 'cause that's the<br> only business you wanna be in.<br> Hey, Jack! Listen, Jack!<br> You don't wanna go in the knife<br> business with Mr. Rose, man.<br> - What you wanna do?<br> - Just tell him you're in<br> the apple business!<br> - What you wanna do?<br> What you want, man?<br> - Jack!<br> - Tell him you in<br> the apple business, boy!<br> - It ain't worth it.<br> - Shut up, Peaches!<br> - What you want?<br> Now, I'm in<br> the knife business, Jack.<br> I'm in the knife business!<br> Let me tell ya, you don't wanna be<br> in no kind of knife business with me.<br> Now I think it's time<br> for you to go fishin'.<br> He kind of fast,<br> ain't he, Jack?<br> Well, the good news is, you're already<br> half undressed for swimmin'.<br> Shoot, that Jack too slow<br> to get me.<br> I was so fast<br> I cut my own self.<br> You really showed him, huh?<br> You just about<br> cut your hand off.<br> And all you cut off him<br> was his clothes.<br> Now you know and I know you<br> don't go to nobody's jail for<br> cuttin' a guy's clothes off.<br> Ain't that right?<br> Rose Rose, ain't that right?<br> - Oooh.<br> - Ain't that right, Homer?<br> - Easy, easy. Okay. Jus...<br> Aaah!<br> God...<br> Not too much gas.<br> There you go.<br> You wanna go right in here.<br> Okay, okay, okay!<br> Slow on the gas. You really<br> have to be gentle.<br> That's the one.<br> That's the one.<br> We wanna stay right there.<br> Got it?<br> Slowly, slowly, slowly.<br> Okay, okay, okay!<br> You're a natural. You were born<br> to drive a car like this.<br> - You think so?<br> - Yeah. So this is a speaker.<br> This is where the sound<br> for the movie comes out.<br> Oh. I love this place.<br> This is, uh...<br> Have you seen a lot of movies here?<br> Yes and no.<br> When you come here, you don't really<br> care about the movie.<br> You don't care<br> about the movie?<br> What are you so crazy<br> about movies for?<br> Ah... That was my favorite night<br> at the orphanage. Movie night.<br> We'd all... We'd all<br> race into the dining hall,<br> and, of course, everyone wanted<br> to sit in front.<br> So we'd be packed in so tight you could<br> feel the kid next to you breathing.<br> You don't miss it?<br> I miss things.<br> I miss people.<br> I miss reading to the boys.<br> You had so much<br> responsibility, huh?<br> I didn't ask<br> for any responsibility.<br> Just a little privacy.<br> Well, you're in luck.<br> Let me show you.<br> Because privacy is what<br> drive-in movies are all about.<br> So, scrunch down like this.<br> Come on.<br> Scrunch down.<br> All the way.<br> And then<br> give me your arm.<br> Put your arm around me.<br> You just cuddle and hug<br> and, you know.<br> You don't really<br> watch the movie.<br> I would watch the movie.<br> Sorry, Fuzzy.<br> It's Homer's splice again.<br> Fuzzy?<br> Fuzz?<br> If the little ones<br> want to know what happened,<br> tell them that Fuzzy<br> was adopted.<br> - Okay.<br> - So, what happened to Fuzzy?<br> - He was adopted.<br> - Good.<br> - Will they believe that, you think?<br> - They'll believe it...<br> because they<br> want to believe it.<br> - Shouldn't we tell Homer?<br> - If Homer wanted to know<br> what was happening here,<br> he could pick up<br> the telephone and call us.<br> I think it was a nurse or a nanny<br> who, uh, who adopted Fuzzy.<br> Someone who could<br> take care of him.<br> Because they had a better<br> breathing machine...<br> than the one that Dr. Larch<br> built for him.<br> So I think we should be<br> happy for Fuzzy, okay?<br> He found a family.<br> Good night, Fuzzy.<br> Good night, Fuzzy.<br> Homer.<br> Morning, everybody.<br> Mornin', Miss Olive.<br> - Look. There's mail for you, Homer.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Rose, I brought those clothes for you.<br> Come on. Let's go see if they fit.<br> What's that?<br> - Oh, ain't you gonna open it, Homer?<br> - No.<br> Mind your business,<br> now, Peaches.<br> - Sorry 'bout that, Homer.<br> - It's okay.<br> - Okay, okay, okay.<br> - Oh, look. Right here.<br> It's glass.<br> Look at that.<br> - Isn't that beautiful?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Give me your hand.<br> Feel that.<br> - Feel that?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> The ocean rubs it<br> against the sand.<br> That's how it gets<br> that smooth.<br> Takes a year for it to get<br> like that, though.<br> Come on.<br> Ah!<br> You're too fast!<br> He volunteered.<br> Jesus. Nobody volunteers for<br> the Burma run. He said so himself.<br> He just leaves me here. What does<br> he want? He wants me to wait for him?<br> Oh, God, he knows me.<br> He knows I'm not good<br> at being alone.<br> This was right.<br> I know this was right.<br> - You're right. This was right.<br> - Yeah.<br> Just tell me. Do you want me to stay?<br> Do you want me to go?<br> I don't know.<br> I really don't know.<br> I just...<br> think we should<br> just wait and see.<br> Okay.<br> - Are we all set?<br> - Yeah, that's it.<br> Goodbye, Arthur. Thank you again<br> for all your hard work.<br> - My pleasure, ma'am.<br> - Have a safe trip, Rose. God bless.<br> - Take care now.<br> - Homer, you take care of yourself.<br> - Okay. You too. Okay.<br> - We'll see you next year.<br> - Homer, see you later.<br> - Bye, everyone.<br> - Bye.<br> - Don't freeze to death, Homer.<br> - Don't get yourself<br> in no trouble, Homer.<br> - Go on and freeze to death<br> if you want to, Homer.<br> - Shut up, Jack.<br> Take care<br> of yourself, Homer.<br> So you're staying.<br> Olive told me.<br> You know, you could have<br> told me yourself.<br> I'm just waiting and seeing,<br> like you said.<br> Dear Dr. Larch,<br> Thank you for your doctor's bag,<br> although it seems that I will not<br> have the occasion to use it,<br> barring some emergency,<br> of course.<br> I'm not a doctor.<br> With all due respect to your profession,<br> I'm enjoying my life here.<br> I'm enjoying being<br> a lobsterman and an orchardman.<br> In fact, I've never<br> enjoyed myself as much.<br> The truth is, I want to stay here.<br> I believe I'm being of some use.<br> I've looked at<br> so many women,<br> and I've never...<br> I've never felt a thing,<br> you know.<br> I mean, I've seen everything.<br> Just felt nothing.<br> With you, it, uh...<br> To look at you, it hurts.<br> Come here.<br> My dear Homer:<br> I thought you were over<br> your adolescence...<br> the first time in our lives<br> when we imagine we have...<br> something terrible to hide<br> from those who love us.<br> - Homer?<br> - Do you think it's not obvious<br> to us what's happened to you?<br> You've fallen in love,<br> haven't you?<br> By the way, whatever you're up to can't<br> be too good for your heart.<br> Then again, it's the sort<br> of condition that could be<br> made worse by worrying about it,<br> so don't worry<br> about it.<br> - Dear Dr. Larch:<br> What I'm learning here may not be<br> as important as what I learned from you,<br> but everything<br> is new to me.<br> Yesterday, I learned<br> how to poison mice.<br> Field mice girdle an apple tree,:<br> Pine mice kill the roots.<br> You use poison oats<br> and poison corn.<br> I know what you have to do.<br> You have to play God.<br> Well, killing mice is as close as I want<br> to come to playing God.<br> Homer, here<br> in St. Cloud's,<br> I have been given<br> the opportunity of playing God...<br> or leaving practically<br> everything up to chance.<br> Men and women of conscience<br> should seize those moments...<br> when it's possible<br> to play God.<br> There won't be many.<br> Do I interfere when<br> absolutely helpless women...<br> tell me they simply can't<br> have an abortion...<br> that they simply must go through with<br> having another and yet another orphan?<br> I do not.<br> I do not even recommend.<br> I just give them<br> what they want.<br> You are my<br> work of art, Homer.<br> Everything else<br> has been just a job.<br> I don't know if you've got<br> a work of art in you,<br> but I know what your job is:<br> You're a doctor.<br> I'm not a doctor.<br> You're going to<br> replace me.<br> The board of trustees<br> is looking for my replacement.<br> I can't replace you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> "Sorry"?<br> I'm not sorry.<br> Not for anything I've done.<br> I'm not even sorry<br> that I love you.<br> I think we may have<br> lost him to the world.<br> Come on, come on.<br> Just read the label.<br> - Come on.

Okay?<br> Don't do anything, Rose.<br> Don't do anything<br> to yourself, okay?<br> Rose? Do you hear me?<br> - Rose, do you hear me?<br> - Go on!<br> - Homer?<br> I think we should take her<br> to St. Cloud's and let her<br> decide when she gets there.<br> I told her.<br> She doesn't feel she can do that.<br> Well, we have to<br> help her, right?<br> We need to do something,<br> don't we?<br> Homer?<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> I have some more clothes<br> for you. I just keep forgetting<br> to bring them with me.<br> I don't need no more clothes.<br> Thanks.<br> I know what's<br> goin' on, Rose.<br> Homer told me.<br> You don't know this, but I got<br> pregnant about a year ago.<br> Do you want to have<br> this baby?<br> No?<br> Who's the father?<br> Does he know?<br> If you don't want to have<br> this baby, Homer and I will take<br> you to a place. It's safe.<br> - He knows this doc...<br> - I can't go nowhere.<br> Why?<br> Rose, listen to me.<br> You can tell me.<br> It's okay.<br> - Mornin'.<br> - Morning, Mr. Rose.<br> I'm gonna be up top, okay?<br> Mr. Rose.<br> He's the father.<br> - What?<br> - He's her baby's father.<br> Mr. Rose is<br> her baby's father.<br> Her baby.<br> Mr. Rose is the father.<br> - What? Are you sure?<br> - I can't believe this.<br> I knew there was something wrong.<br> What is she gonna do?<br> God, I can't believe it. We have to<br> keep her away from that bastard.<br> - Mr. Rose?<br> - Homer.<br> I know you ain't ready<br> for lunch, boy.<br> - Is it, uh, true?<br> - What's that?<br> Uh, are you...<br> sleeping with<br> your own daughter?<br> I think you've been staying up<br> too late at night, Homer.<br> You're having sex<br> with your own daughter.<br> Ain't nobody havin' sex with my<br> daughter! Let me just tell you that.<br> You're lying. Aren't you<br> ashamed of yourself?<br> What do you care<br> who hears?<br> I mean, come on.<br> They know already, don't they?<br> - They know, Mr. Rose.<br> - And you know<br> what your business is, boy!<br> I know you don't wanna be<br> in no kind of business with me!<br> - That's what I know.<br> - Yeah? Go on. Cut my clothes.<br> I've got other clothes.<br> You gonna come here talkin'<br> to me about lies and shame?<br> Those people took you in, and<br> that boy Wally is away at war!<br> - Yeah, well, she's your daughter!<br> - And I love her!<br> Ain't never gonna do<br> nothin' to harm her.<br> She's pregnant, you know that?<br> She's pregnant.<br> No! No!<br> He was over Burma<br> when he was shot down.<br> There were no injuries<br> from the crash, just disease.<br> When the plane was hit, the crew chief<br> and the radioman jumped close together.<br> The co-pilot jumped third,<br> all on Captain Worthington's orders.<br> - Come in.<br> - The captain was still flying the plane.<br> None of the men on the ground<br> could see the sky. That's<br> how thick the jungle was.<br> They never saw the plane crash.<br> They never heard it crash.<br> They never saw Captain<br> Worthington's parachute either.<br> But he was missing<br> for 20 days. Why?<br> He followed the Irrawaddy River<br> all the way to Rangoon.<br> He managed to avoid the Japs<br> but not the mosquitoes.<br> So it's malaria.<br> It's, um,<br> encephalitis "B."<br> What's that?<br> Captain Worthington is paralyzed<br> from the waist down.<br> He... He won't walk.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - When is he coming home?<br> In about a month.<br> By the end of October.<br> Just tell me.<br> I'll do whatever you wanna do.<br> Nothing.<br> Isn't that like<br> waiting and seeing?<br> No.<br> Nothing's nothing.<br> I want Wally<br> to come home.<br> I'm afraid to see him too.<br> - I know.<br> - Oh, don't do that, Homer.<br> I just want to sit here<br> and do nothing.<br> To do nothing.<br> It's a great idea,<br> really.<br> Maybe if I just<br> wait and see long enough,<br> then I won't have to do anything<br> or decide anything, you know?<br> I mean, maybe if<br> I'm lucky enough,<br> someone else will decide and choose<br> and do things for me.<br> What are you<br> talking about?<br> But then again,<br> maybe I won't be that lucky.<br> And it's not my fault.<br> It's not your fault.<br> And that's just it. Someone's gonna<br> get hurt, and it's no one's fault.<br> - I don't want to talk about this.<br> - If we just sit here...<br> and we wait and see<br> a little while longer,<br> then maybe you won't have to choose,<br> and I won't have to do anything!<br> What do you want from me?<br> Wally's been shot down. He's paralyzed.<br> What do you<br> want me to do?<br> Nothing. I'm sorry.<br> You're not the one<br> who has to do anything.<br> Where you<br> think you're goin'?<br> I got to go, Daddy.<br> You have to let me go.<br> Wait, Rose. Just wait.<br> I ain't gonna let you go nowhere<br> in the middle of the night.<br> - Hey. Hey.<br> - I can't stay here no more, Daddy.<br> Hey, nothin'.

That's what we say.<br> That's right.<br> That's the truth.<br> I'm just tryin'<br> to put things straight.<br> Sometimes you gotta<br> break some rules,<br> put things straight.<br> Ain't that right, Homer?<br> Good.<br> Do you think Rose<br> will be okay?<br> She'll be all right.<br> She knows how to take care of herself.<br> This is for you.<br> Olive wanted me to bring it.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> I know you don't think<br> much of being needed, or of<br> me for that matter, but I...<br> I'm sorry for what I said<br> about Wally needing you.<br> It was unnecessary.<br> You had every right<br> to be angry.<br> No, you warned me.<br> You told me you weren't<br> any good at being alone.<br> Wally's gonna be okay.<br> I know he is.<br> Yeah?<br> Dear Homer: I am<br> writing you to tell you about Dr. Larch.<br> Dr. Larch?<br> Dr. Larch?<br> Wilbur.<br> Oh, Wilbur.<br> Wilbur.<br> I can assure you<br> that the overdose...<br> was entirely accidental.<br> Let us be happy for Dr. Larch.<br> Dr. Larch has found a family.<br> Good night, Dr. Larch.<br> Good night, Dr. Larch.<br> Come on, Muddy.<br> Step on it, man!<br> - Let's get on it.<br> - Get on it, man.<br> I wanna get to the sunshine.<br> - Ha-ha-ha!<br> - Homer!<br> - Yeah!<br> - You ever seen a palm tree?<br> Oh, he ain't never<br> been outta Maine!<br> Ain't you sick<br> of pine trees, Homer?<br> - Let me tell you<br> something about Florida, Homer.<br> - The sun shines!<br> Man, it's so warm<br> down there, you can pick grapefruits...<br> and oranges naked<br> if you want to.<br> - Who would want to do that?<br> - I'm just sayin'<br> it's warm, Hero.<br> You used to say it was too hot.<br> Not me.<br> I love them peaches.<br> I love my peaches.<br> Homer? Hey,<br> what you think, Homer?<br> I'd love to go<br> with you guys,<br> but I have to move on.<br> - Hey, you hear that, Muddy?<br> - What?<br> - Boy said he ain't movin' on with us.<br> - Oh, Homer!<br> Come on, Homer.<br> Come on down with us!<br> - I can't do it, guys.<br> - Well, I reckon you gotta do<br> what you gotta do.<br> O Lord, support us<br> all the day long...<br> until the shadows lengthen<br> and the evening comes...<br> and the busy world is hushed<br> and the fever of life is over<br> and our work is done.<br> Then, in Thy mercy, grant us<br> a safe lodging and a holy rest...<br> and peace at the last.<br> Amen.<br> Homer?<br> Homer!
