I don't know where he is.<br> You know, I believe<br> you really didn't know where he was.<br> What's inside?<br> - There you go.<br> - Watch yourself.<br> What's up, kid?<br> What are you so scared of?<br> Did you have a bad dream?<br> You' re scaring your mama.<br> Get your thumb out.<br> Come on, baby.<br> Where have you been?<br> What is wrong with your brother?<br> What have you done now?<br> What the hell is going on?<br> - Boy witnessed a suicide, ma'am.<br> - He what?<br> Me and Ricky was just...<br> ...out in the woods playing...<br> This guy was dead<br> with a gun in his mouth.<br> Oh, my dear God!<br> And I ran home and called 911.<br> What happened to Ricky?<br> He just laid on the bed<br> and started sucking his thumb.<br> This is Sgt. Hardy.<br> We need paramedics at Sway's trailer.<br> This boy needs to be hospitalized.<br> I have no health insurance.<br> St. Peter's will take indigent cases.<br> Just pack up some things<br> in a bag for the hospital.<br> You telling the truth?<br> About what you saw?<br> Don't you believe me?<br> I didn't say I didn't believe you.<br> It just seems strange.<br> You called 911,<br> but you wouldn't leave your name.<br> I was scared.<br> It was the first dead guy I ever saw.<br> Then why'd you sneak back<br> and hide in the woods?<br> I don't know.<br> I just wanted to see, I guess.<br> Did you talk to the man...<br> ...before he killed himself?<br> No, I never talked to him.<br> Does "Jerome Clifford "<br> mean anything to you?<br> I found some fresh cigarette butts...<br> ...near the body.<br> Same brand as your mom smokes.<br> Somehow I can't see you<br> finding the body and then...<br> ...deciding to have a cigarette.<br> Look, Officer, we was walking through<br> the woods when we found Romey dead.<br> - That's all.<br> - Who's Romey?<br> - That's the guy's name, isn't it?<br> - I said, "Jerome Clifford. "<br> Whoever heard of the name Romey?<br> I'm Dr. Greenway, is this your son?<br> - Yes.<br> - What's his name?<br> - How long has he been this way?<br> - I didn't find him, my boy Mark did.<br> You found him, Mark? Ricky?<br> Jerome R. Clifford, attorney,<br> was found dead...<br> ...in an apparent suicide<br> outside Memphis just hours ago.<br> The famed Mafia lawyer<br> was to defend the alleged hitman...<br> ...Barry "The Blade" Muldano...<br> ...in the notorious case<br> of still-missing Louisiana senator...<br> ...Boyd Boyette, now presumed dead.<br> It'd be tough to build a case<br> against Muldano without a body...<br> ...but surely Clifford's death<br> will mean more delays.<br> As one informed source tells me...<br> ...the plot thickens<br> for U. S. Attorney Roy Foltrigg.<br> No body, no case, no conviction.<br> That means no front-page pictures<br> that Foltrigg likes so much.<br> No CNN interviews,<br> no speedy ascent to Capitol Hill.<br> Sorry, Reverend Roy.<br> I never liked that old cow.<br> We' re here, Roy.<br> He tried it first with a hose attached<br> to the tailpipe, but it didn't work.<br> - He was probably too stoned.<br> - He was full of downers and whiskey.<br> I guess he figured he'd swallow a bullet<br> for dessert. Cheap snub-nosed. 38.<br> Definitely a suicide.<br> Damn him. Two days ago I told him:<br> " I have enough evidence<br> to put your fat ass on the stand. "<br> I was bullshitting of course. But...<br> ...I didn't know he'd get so nervous<br> he'd kill himself.<br> He knew where the body was.<br> He'll never tell us now.<br> Without that body we have no case.<br> - How's the weather in Memphis?<br> - It's hot, Roy.<br> Sprite?<br> What happened?<br> I got in a fight at school.<br> It's summer. There's no school.<br> I meant, a kid from my school.<br> Who?<br> - Why?<br> - Why? Because I'm a cop.<br> It's my job to ask questions.<br> Besides, your story's full of holes.<br> I believe you were in that car<br> before Clifford died.<br> What does "indigent" mean?<br> Indigent?<br> It means " poor. "<br> Like you and your mother<br> and your little brother.<br> So tell the truth...<br> ...hope this snaps him out of it.<br> Otherwise...<br> ...he could lie in some...<br> ...institution for dirt-poor<br> crazy people...<br> ...with padded walls...<br> ...and cockroaches...<br> ...chained to some...<br> ...filthy bed, with snakes...<br> I'm Karen.<br> Come with me.<br> - We'll have to watch him.<br> - What will you do?<br> We'll just watch for now.<br> Sometimes a night's sleep...<br> ...and the next morning they wake up.<br> - His reflexes seem to be good.<br> - That's good.<br> Ricky's real sick.<br> What's wrong?<br> Post-traumatic stress syndrome.<br> Sometimes people see<br> something they can't deal with.<br> I'm always telling Mark...<br> ..." No horror movies.<br> No scary comics. "<br> Not for Ricky.<br> He's always been tender that way.<br> Easy, now.<br> You try to protect them,<br> but it's so bad out there.<br> Why don't you get some rest?<br> Just lie down and rest.<br> There's nothing more you can do.<br> We'll watch him.<br> You've had a rough day.<br> Just lie down. Stay with him.<br> Bad injury. What happened?<br> Car wreck. Got hit by a truck.<br> Nut ran a stop sign.<br> My name's Gill Beale. I'm a lawyer.<br> You got a problem, I can fix it.<br> I specialize in car wrecks.<br> Now, let's see what you got here.<br> - Broken leg, concussion, broken ribs-<br> - And a broken collarbone.<br> Great.<br> I can get you $600,000.<br> We'll file suit tomorrow.<br> Did I say 6? Six is just for starters.<br> Check me out.<br> Call up Gill Beale, he's for real.<br> More lawyers around this place<br> than there are doctors.<br> Don't be that way.<br> I'll outrun that little buggy of yours.<br> Wait till you get a load of this guy.<br> Mr. Foltrigg, Jason McThune, FBI.<br> Welcome to Memphis...<br> ...home of the King.<br> What do you know?<br> Kid's name is Mark Sway.<br> He said that he and his brother just<br> stumbled on the body in the woods.<br> - Then called the cops. He's lying.<br> - Why?<br> We got a set of his fingerprints. They<br> match prints that were inside the car.<br> He was in that car with Clifford<br> before he died, for quite a while.<br> There's a lot of prints.<br> - Why would he lie?<br> - He's scared.<br> And he's a kid. They always lie.<br> And maybe Romey Clifford told him<br> something he knows he shouldn't know.<br> People hate to die with secrets.<br> That's good work.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I'm going to keep it up, believe me.<br> Listen...<br> ...I'm sick of chasing Elvis sightings.<br> Is there any room on your staff?<br> - Where do you want to go?<br> - Anywhere.<br> Do something with your hair first.<br> Meantime, I want to talk to Mark.<br> Right away, sir.<br> Dr. Greenway wants to see you.<br> How old are you?<br> Are you married?<br> Sometimes.<br> I don't know nothing,<br> but he looks better to me.<br> He'll be fine if we get him home<br> in his own bed.<br> I don't know why you just can't...<br> ...give him some medicine or something.<br> - I have to go to work.<br> - Mrs. Sway, listen to me.<br> Our trailer rents by the week.<br> Listen to me.<br> Right now, it's as if Ricky<br> is in a dark place...<br> ...and trying to find a way out.<br> What's important...<br> ...what's very important is that<br> when he finds that way out...<br> ...the first thing he sees is your face.<br> Let's hope it'll only takes a few days.<br> There goes another job.<br> Must be setting some kind of record.<br> - I'll call your boss. He'll understand.<br> - My boss runs a sweatshop.<br> He will not send flowers.<br> He will not understand.<br> You could take shifts.<br> Perhaps the father could come.<br> Ex-father!<br> And you keep him away from Ricky!<br> Hush!<br> Okay, mom. I'm sorry.<br> I don't know if you've seen this,<br> but there are policemen downstairs...<br> ...and reporters and...<br> ...the FBI is coming to see Mark.<br> I don't want to talk to them.

Don't you read the paper?<br> You haven't answered my question.<br> Because I'm supposed to talk to<br> Reverend Roy in 10 minutes.<br> Reverend Roy Foltrigg?<br> Why is he called that?<br> He quotes the scriptures in court<br> and knows the Bible better than God.<br> He wins a lot?<br> Always.<br> Why can't people leave me alone?<br> Some sweaty guy kills himself-<br> Why'd you lie to the police?<br> - I didn't.<br> - It says here in the paper.<br> You found Clifford dead.<br> I did.<br> Dead men don't sweat...<br> ...now, do they?<br> If you was my lawyer...<br> ...and I told you something,<br> could you repeat it?<br> No. What is it you want to tell me?<br> That Clifford guy came...<br> ...driving up in his big black car<br> and me and Ricky...<br> ...snuck up to watch...<br> ...and that Clifford got out...<br> ...put a gun in his mouth,<br> and blew the back of his head out.<br> So you did see Clifford alive.<br> Why'd you lie to the police?<br> I don't know.<br> I was just scared, I guess.<br> My brother's in a coma<br> and my mom might lose her job.<br> The FBl's after me but<br> I don't know nothing.

That's it!<br> Help me!<br> There's no reason to get excited.<br> We'll take care of him.<br> - You' re getting riled up.<br> - Get your hands off of me!<br> They' re taking me to jail!<br> I'm 11! They hit my mother!<br> Shut up.<br> You going to read me my rights?<br> Do you even know how to read?<br> You' re going to cuff me?<br> - This isn't an arrest.<br> - What the hell is it?<br> - Watch your mouth!<br> - Kiss my ass, you stupid jerk!<br> He's all yours.<br> Calm down.<br> Empty your pockets.<br> Now follow me.<br> - There you are.<br> - I don't look bad.<br> You look good.<br> You got what you want.<br> The kid's in custody.<br> The hearing's tomorrow at 10 a. m.<br> I knew you could do it.<br> Well done.<br> One child in jail.<br> - What kind of place is this?<br> - Women's detention hall.<br> - Keep it down!<br> - Why am I being put in with women?<br> Because you' re a minor.<br> Stop treating me like a kid.<br> Put me with the men.<br> You' re safer here.<br> You have this whole cell to yourself.<br> - Is this what they mean by solitary?<br> - No.<br> Have any bed you want.<br> Don't give me any trouble.<br> You okay, boy?<br> Can I call my mom<br> just to tell her where I'm at...<br> .. and that I'm okay?<br> Please, she's probably<br> worried sick about me.<br> I suppose I could run a phone in here.<br> I'll make this little exception,<br> just this once.<br> Thank you.<br> Brother's Pizza.<br> I'd like to order 20 large Supremes.<br> And where's that going?<br> I'm ordering for Detective Nassar,<br> North Precinct.<br> And how would you like<br> to pay for it?<br> With my credit card.<br> Number, please.<br> The number is...<br> ...4000-0306...<br> ...1954...<br> ...0010.<br> Okay. Hold on.<br> That'll be $248. 10.<br> Fine. Cheaper than the last time.<br> Thank you.<br> Can't get him out.<br> Foltrigg filed a custody petition<br> and the hearing's at 10.<br> after filing a petition.<br> - Foltrigg'll do anything.<br> - You got that right.<br> A child behind bars for the night.<br> I have been through this wallet 3 times.<br> I found everything except my Visa.<br> Did you order the pizzas?<br> My, my, my.<br> You didn't have to sign a custody order.<br> I would have brought him.<br> Good morning to you too.<br> What's going on?<br> According to the FBI...<br> ...a Mr. Paul Gronke...<br> ...and his pal, Bono...<br> ...have just arrived in our city.<br> You ever heard of these guys?<br> Your client could be...<br> ...in a world of danger.<br> What does he know?<br> That's privileged.<br> He knows more than he should.<br> If he did know something...<br> ...would you guarantee witness<br> protection for him and his family?<br> This isn't standard.<br> Damn it! Why should he talk<br> if we can't protect him?<br> Forgive my presumption here,<br> but you do seem overly agitated.<br> Whatever became of that...<br> ...objectivity we used to fight about<br> at Memphis State?<br> After all...<br> ...he is just a client.<br> Isn't he?<br> Sorry, I didn't get much sleep.<br> It's just that...<br> ...he's never had a break<br> and he's counting on me.<br> Thanks, Doreen.<br> Good luck.<br> Brought your jacket.<br> You all right?<br> You sure clean up good.<br> You too.<br> Why can't Ijust tell them<br> I don't know nothing?<br> Because it's wrong,<br> and it's against the law.<br> And besides, no one will believe you.<br> Not the Mob, not the FBl, nobody.<br> Besides that, Muldano's a killer.<br> You've got a chance to stop him<br> before he hurts somebody else.<br> But didn't you tell the truth in divorce<br> court, about being a good mom?<br> Proof. The truth hurts.<br> They took your kids away!<br> You' re right.<br> Don't you see? If you lie,<br> you' re going to be just like them.<br> If I tell the truth, he'll kill me.<br> All right.<br> Have you ever heard...<br> ...of the witness protection program?<br> That's where they put you...<br> ...in funny mustaches and send you off<br> to New Jersey or someplace to live.<br> I saw it on TV. But the guy on the TV<br> movie, the Mob found him anyways.<br> They blew his legs off.<br> You saw that on TV?<br> No matter what I do,<br> I could probably get killed.<br> You can't let them ask me<br> any questions.<br> I'll try.<br> But if Foltrigg<br> gets you on the stand...<br> ...you can't lie...<br> ...or you'll be just like them.<br> Court is in session.<br> My...<br> We certainly have drawn a crowd<br> this morning. Officer?<br> I'm Sergeant Hardy.<br> What are you doing here with a gun?<br> Wait...<br> Thank you. You may go.<br> And you, Mr. Moeller.<br> Your coverage of the case has led me<br> to consider having you indicted...<br> ...for reckless endangerment.<br> But Your Honor-<br> Another word<br> and I will slap you with contempt.<br> Good day, sir.<br> Now, that's better.<br> Shall we proceed?<br> I'd like to note for the record<br> that the child is without a parent.<br> Request postponement<br> until she can appear.<br> I'm Thomas Fink, Assistant<br> U.S. Attorney for eastern Louisiana.<br> I'd like to address the issue<br> of the absence of the child's mother.<br> It's the position of the petitioners-<br> Your position...<br> ...is in that chair.<br> Please sit.<br> Listen carefully, I'll say this once.<br> As for you, Mr. Foltrigg...<br> ...this isn't New Orleans<br> and I'm not one of your federal judges.<br> This is my private courtroom<br> and I make the rules.<br> Rule one: You will speak<br> only when spoken to.<br> Rule two: Do not grace His Honor<br> with unsolicited commentary.<br> Rule three: His Honor doesn't like<br> to listen to U.S. Attorneys...<br> ...who love to hear themselves speak.<br> Do you understand?<br> Is Fink to handle the case<br> for the prosecution?<br> Yes, if it pleases the court, sir.<br> I'll allow it, but try<br> and keep his butt in that seat.<br> The court will act in loco parentis.<br> I'll watch out for the child's interests<br> in this hearing, Ms. Love. Proceed.<br> The child moves to dismiss.<br> The allegations are without merit.<br> The petition was filed to explore<br> what the child might know.<br> Quit calling me "the child. "<br> Quiet.<br> Proceed.<br> Mr. Foltrigg and Mr. Fink...<br> ...are using this hearing<br> as a fishing expedition.<br> Their supposition that the...<br> my client...<br> ...had any legally significant<br> conversation with Mr. Clifford...<br> ...is based on circumstantial evidence.<br> The petition should be dismissed.<br> Your Honor?<br> - If I may?<br> - You may.<br> The child is the last person<br> to see Jerome Clifford alive.<br> We have established<br> he willfully deceived us.<br> Fingerprints on a Cadillac<br> is hardly willful deceit.<br> We can show the child's fingerprints on<br> the suicide hose and on the gun itself.<br> We feel the child must testify<br> in order to exonerate himself.<br> Are you attempting to implicate<br> this child in Clifford's suicide?<br> No, we are alleging only<br> obstruction of justice.<br> Involvement in a suicide<br> could constitute juvenile delinquency.<br> He'd be taken from his mother-<br> There is no basis for this.<br> We are only asking that the child<br> testify to clear his good name.<br> We' re not forcing him<br> to testify, not yet.<br> Will he testify and put an end<br> to this foolishness?<br> If we refuse?<br> I'd have to lock him back up<br> till we sort this out.<br> The child moves for a change of venue.<br> The murder of Boyette occurred in<br> Louisiana. We'd like to relocate there.<br> As the U.S. Attorney for eastern<br> Louisiana, I waive venue.<br> The child declines.<br> - We give the case to your jurisdiction.<br> - The child declines.<br> That's a pretty suit.<br> Drop dead.<br> All right, you two.<br> Just settle down.<br> Nice try, but it would be<br> in everybody's best interests...<br> ...for Mark to take the stand.<br> That's my ruling.<br> I want you to come up here<br> and take this seat right by me.<br> It's okay.<br> Put up your right hand.<br> You swear to tell the truth?<br> Say it.<br> I swear.<br> Mr. Fink will ask you questions.<br> He'll keep them clear and simple.<br> May I rise?<br> How are you, Mark?<br> Were you forced into the car<br> with Mr. Clifford before he died?<br> Did you and Clifford converse?<br> Listen up.<br> Did Clifford mention Barry Muldano<br> or Senator Boyd Boyette?<br> Answer me.<br> Is taking the 5th Amendment lying?<br> No, it's not lying.<br> Can I take the 5th?<br> No, you cannot!<br> Why not? Doesn't it apply to kids?<br> Not in this case.<br> You' re not implicated in Boyette's<br> death, so you must answer the question.<br> As Mr. Foltrigg has tried<br> so thoroughly to implicate Mark...<br> ...I must, out of<br> an abundance of caution...<br> ...advise my client to take the 5th.<br> Haven't we played enough games?<br> We are all searchers for the truth.<br> A man's been murdered<br> and another man has killed himself...<br> ...yet this boy remains silent.<br> What wanton hubris is this?<br> Speak! Lying lips are an abomination<br> to the Lord, so sayeth the Psalm.<br> No, that's Proverbs, 12. 22.<br> This is still a courtroom,<br> not a church.<br> Please, sit down.<br> Did Romey Clifford tell you<br> where Boyd Boyette's body's at?<br> Answer the question.<br> I take the 5th Amendment.<br> I'm sorry, but I can't answer<br> any of these questions...<br> ...because I'm afraid of what<br> might happen to me or my family.<br> I have no choice but to return you<br> to protective custody.<br> It's for your own protection.<br> Can't you make him<br> answer the question?<br> These proceedings are closed.<br> I didn't lie.<br> You did great.<br> What lawyer tells a child<br> to plead the 5th, go back to jail...<br> ...and hold up a Federal investigation?<br> Are you trying to ruin this boy's life?<br> You did real good.<br> - We alone?<br> - Yes, we' re alone.<br> What happened?<br> I want a bit more this time.<br> I asked you a question.<br> Kid's going back to jail.<br> Judge wants him safe.<br> - What's he know?<br> - I'd say he knows everything.<br> The bastard.<br> He'll be in court tomorrow in case<br> a night in jail changes his mind.<br> - You didn't hear this from me.<br> - Shut up!<br> Give me a little break here.<br> Go powder your nose.<br> What is it? I'm eating here!<br> I just talked to Gronke in Memphis.<br> What can I get you?<br> Dos Equis.<br> Where's your regular waiter?<br> I don't know.<br> Cops got the kid.<br> I still can't move the stiff.<br> You' re a dumb ass, you know that?<br> We've had this conversation.<br> I'm sick of it. I deserve respect.<br> Nice work, Norm.<br> Picking it up just fine.<br> We still need to make the move.<br> The bastard knows something.<br> Probably told his lawyer.<br> We 're tapping the phones.<br> I hate goddamn lawyers.<br> Please, let me hit the kid.<br> We don't have to worry about him.<br> Let's call it quits.<br> The kid knows.<br> Goddamn bugs.<br> The city's lousy with them.<br> You' re probably right.<br> He knows nothing.<br> They' re onto us.<br> We' re out of business.<br> We' re putting this whole thing<br> behind us. Is that clear?<br> I got it, Uncle Johnny.<br> - What're you doing?<br> - Nothing, go to bed.<br> Do you know what time it is?<br> Mama, have you seen<br> my notebooks from school?<br> In the garage, maybe.<br> Oh, shit, yeah.<br> You need to get some sleep.<br> He's your client, Regina,<br> not your child.<br> Damn!<br> Damn!<br> Telda, call the medic! Quick!<br> Medic on 5 now!<br> Goddamn, the boy's soaking wet!<br> - He's in shock, isn't he?<br> - Go get a towel.<br> - What's going on?<br> - I don't know.<br> This kid's heart is about to explode.<br> Get an ambulance!<br> Right. Telda, call an ambulance!<br> - What is it?<br> - Elevated pulse and BP.<br> Shakes and sweats.<br> He's from juvenile court.<br> Did he bleed or anything?<br> He can wait 5 minutes.<br> - Sign on the line and he's yours.<br> - Where are the police?<br> He's just a juvenile.<br> Goddamn it! Look at this, man!<br> My guitar. I just can't believe it.<br> Look at my guitar.<br> - Forget the guitar.<br> - No, honey, this is an original guitar!<br> These people over here need help. I<br> need a new guitar. Who'll pay for this?<br> Is there coffee?<br> - There's a pot there.<br> - Too hot in there for you?<br> Paging Mr. Sway.<br> It's nothing personal, kid.<br> I don't want to hurt you.<br> I just want to talk.<br> Want a smoke?<br> Let's smoke together.<br> Okay, you little punk!<br> Game's over.<br> Isn't this a nice spot to die!<br> I wonder if we' re going to find<br> a live body in here.<br> Come here, boy.<br> Open this door,<br> you little punk! I'll kill you!<br> Chief, this isn't very...<br> It's about Mark Sway. He's escaped.<br> Pardon me?<br> Hi, thought you could use some coffee.<br> - Here you go.<br> - Thanks.<br> You' re welcome.<br> Is this really the best time<br> to defrost the freezer?<br> Will you shut up?<br> Need anything, just holler.<br> - What are you being nice to them for?<br> - Because they' re cute.<br> They' re just being protective.<br> Where have you been?<br> They are here hoping an 11-year-old<br> comes by so they can pounce on him!<br> I feel like a prisoner.<br> Shit!<br> Will you just be calm!<br> You haven't sat still<br> since they got here.<br> The cops don't stake out<br> your home everyday.<br> Fine. Let's just relax.<br> Can we do that?<br> Let's sit down and relax.<br> I'm relaxed.<br> Reggie, it's me.<br> I've busted out of jail, come get me.<br> Jeanette!<br> It's Jeanette!<br> It's Jeanette.<br> What' re you doing calling me so late?<br> Who's Jeanette?<br> I'm at St. Peter's, hiding out.<br> I ran in place for an hour...<br> ...and faked an attack<br> of post-traumatic stress disorder.<br> They rushed me right over.<br> It was easy as pie.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - No, I'm not okay.<br> I locked a Mafia guy in the morgue.<br> He was trying to kill me.<br> I hear something down the hallway!<br> Go find yourself a policeman, now.<br> Someone's locked in the cooler.<br> I'm not going back to jail.<br> If you don't come get me...<br> I'll go where I'm going on my own.<br> I'm serious. You must come get me.<br> You' re the only friend I've got,<br> you know that. Don't let me down.<br> Shit!<br> I'll meet you by the front parking lot<br> in a dark grey Honda.<br> Right in front of the cross...<br> ...the big one.<br> Thank you, Reggie. Thanks.<br> - My dark grey Honda?<br> - Just give me the keys.<br> You can't run away<br> with an escaped whatever-he-is.<br> They'll arrest you. You'll be<br> disbarred. You've lost your mind.<br> Momma, I need you<br> to distract the police.<br> Go get them coffee or something<br> and don't ask me any questions.<br> I need some cash.<br> - This is my rent money.<br> - You can live with Momma.<br> She likes you better than me.<br> That wouldn't be hard.<br> Down! Your mama<br> must be beside herself.<br> I called her and told her we'd fix it.<br> We?<br> You' re an accomplice now, right?<br> Shit!<br> We' re watching the mother's room<br> in case he comes. We bugged her phone.<br> - Talked to her yet?<br> - You said you wanted to.<br> - Your boy's missing.<br> - Missing? You mean, you lost him.<br> Has he tried to contact you tonight?<br> You searched the hospital?<br> He knows it real well.<br> We searched the hospital.<br> Reggie Love is missing too.<br> Could Mark be with her?<br> Hell, you' re the FBI!<br> Since you got involved,<br> our trailer's been blown up...<br> ...my boy's been thrown in jail<br> and now he's missing.<br> So, let me tell you something:<br> Act like the FBl, you find him!<br> - Head towards the bridge.<br> - Why?<br> I've been thinking.<br> That witness protection thing<br> sounds pretty good.<br> But Romey was all drunk and on pills.<br> If the body ain't where he said,<br> would we get witness protection?<br> We'll make our deal before we tell them<br> where the body is, then hope it's there.<br> First, we must be sure<br> the body's there, right?<br> What do you mean?<br> We must go to New Orleans and see if<br> Boyette's body's where Romey said it is.<br> You are out of your mind!<br> No way! Absolutely not!<br> That's it.<br> Where are you going?<br> Stay- Goddamn it!<br> Get back in the car!<br> Where are you going?<br> - Someone'll see you!<br> - Let go!<br> I'll hitchhike!<br> You'll get yourself killed!<br> A lot of other people<br> could get killed if I don't go!<br> I'll do it on my own if I have to.<br> Mark, please. Please!<br> Remember at Momma Love's...<br> ...what you told me<br> about asking people for help?<br> I guess now I'm asking you.<br> Please?<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I'm looking for a map to New Orleans.<br> What do you think I'm doing?<br> The kid broke jail.<br> The lawyer's missing.<br> Gronke spent all night in a freezer.<br> No one has been killed<br> and the body has not been moved.<br> Can you explain this to me,<br> Barry "The Blade"?<br> The thing is, Uncle Johnny...<br> ...I hid the body under a boat<br> in Romey's boathouse.<br> You what?<br> I wanted Romey to know how close<br> he was to being dead. It was a joke.<br> Very funny.<br> When Romey died<br> there were cops everywhere.<br> Now they' re gone, I'll get it.<br> The way this has been handled<br> has been very stupid.<br> I won't let you take<br> this family down, understand?<br> I'm begging you,<br> just let me get the body.<br> Help me now...<br> ...and I'll never make a mistake again.<br> Take Gronke and Bono.<br> I'm giving you one chance<br> to clear this up.<br> This is my last favor.<br> Thank you, Uncle Johnny.<br> Do you understand what I mean<br> when I say " my last favor"?<br> I understand.<br> Reggie Love's office.<br> Call Dianne, tell her Mark's okay.<br> He's with me.<br> Where the hell are you?<br> A motel outside New Orleans.<br> We'll be back tomorrow.<br> Where?<br> If anything happens,<br> take care of Momma Love for me, okay?<br> Don't hang up.<br> Got something.<br> Good. Good work.<br> We just monitored a call from Clint Von<br> Hooser to Dianne Sway at the hospital.<br> Love has the kid in New Orleans.<br> - We' re out of here!<br> - Get the airplane.<br> Excellent news.<br> We' re out of here.<br> We'll call you.<br> Move out, Walter.<br> Go, Wally!<br> Are we still going north?<br> I don't know.

I don't want<br> the shit shocked out of me.<br> Romey's place must be by those trees.<br> Looks like a boathouse.<br> How will we get there?<br> Come on.<br> Shit.<br> That's private property.<br> Turn off the lights and come to bed.<br> What do you think I'm doing?<br> - Romey's neighbors are paranoid.<br> - You'd be too, with the Mafia next door.<br> Don't touch!<br> Damn it!<br> I'll look around for another door.<br> There's another door<br> but it's locked too. Be quiet.<br> I'll try the window.<br> - Do you know how to get to Romey's?<br> - Everyone knows how to get there.<br> Be careful.<br> You okay?<br> See anything?<br> Quiet.<br> You'll wake the neighbors.<br> Do you see?<br> It's definitely a boathouse.<br> Wait! Don't go in there!<br> I'll climb in and unlock the door.<br> Listen to me. Get down here.<br> You okay?<br> - Got to see if the body's here.<br> - No, let me in.<br> It's here!<br> Open this door!<br> I'll kill you<br> if you don't open this door!<br> What happened?<br> Are you okay?<br> It's just a raccoon.<br> Good! Now let me in!<br> - Watch the water. If anyone comes-<br> - I know how to keep lookout.<br> Just take care of business.<br> I think Barry Muldano's coming.<br> Open this door.<br> It's locked.<br> I'm trapped!<br> Got a key?<br> You hear something?<br> Getting paranoid?<br> Shut up, asshole.<br> Bye-bye, Rocky Raccoon.<br> Leave a calling card, why don't you?<br> I told you I heard something, asshole.<br> - You buried him under here?<br> - Under the boat.<br> - Give me one of those picks.<br> - Rocket scientist you are.<br> - There are neighbors around here.<br> - Shut up and start digging.<br> Let's dig and get out of here.<br> Resurrection time, you old bastard.<br> They found the body.<br> Let's just get out of here.<br> You okay?<br> Get this thing off me.<br> Run!<br> You'll die, bitch!<br> Get off her. Now.<br> I'm serious.<br> Let her go.<br> Drop the knife.<br> Mr. Mark Sway!<br> You a big man?<br> You a big man with a gun?<br> You won't shoot anyone.<br> Yes, I will.<br> Give me the gun.<br> He was going to kill you.<br> He was going to kill me. He'd have<br> killed my mom and Ricky.<br> You' re a scared little prick.<br> Probably piss your pants.<br> Come on, big man, pull the trigger.<br> If I just shoot...<br> ...everything'll be okay.<br> No, you'll be just like him.<br> Give it to me.<br> Give it to me.<br> You should have let the kid shoot.<br> You haven't got the balls.<br> Really?<br> Jesus Christ!<br> You robbing son of a bitch!<br> Who the hell are you?<br> No one's breaking into my place,<br> you son of a bitch!<br> Damn it! I'm unarmed!<br> Honey! Get in the house!<br> Call the police!<br> Cops will be here soon.
