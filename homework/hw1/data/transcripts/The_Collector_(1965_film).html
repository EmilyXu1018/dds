My cousin.<br> Bring him along.<br> Actually, I was planning<br> to drive him to London.<br> I'll be gone all day,<br> but if I get back in time...<br> I'll perhaps come over.<br> Well, fine.<br> By the way, did they ever<br> tell you about this thing?<br> It's a priest hole.<br> A priest could hide in here<br> when he was on the run.<br> There's a story that some of Cromwell's<br> men trapped a poor devil in here...<br> and fired right through<br> the wall, killed him.<br> My wife knows more<br> about this place than I do.<br> She's well up on<br> all the local legends.<br> You must get her to come over one day<br> and tell you all about them.<br> Yes, I will.<br> Nice to have met you, Franklin.<br> Good Lord!<br> Look at the water!<br> It's really my girlfriend.<br> Are you all right?<br> I'm coming in.<br> You should have called me.<br> It's all right.<br> I fixed it now.<br> Don't be upset.<br> I should have told you<br> about these old baths.<br> Of course there's no damage.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> The handle came off the tap.<br> I got it back on, though.<br> Why didn't she call out?<br> She was embarrassed.<br> You know how it is.<br> Well, I remember how it was.<br> If you can't make it<br> tomorrow evening...<br> I'll understand.<br> Please tie them in front this time.<br> They hurt the other way.<br> There's something<br> I want to show you.<br> In there.<br> I wouldn't be a good prisoner<br> if I didn't try to escape.<br> It's my hobby.<br> I've been collecting all my life.<br> I'm an entomologist.<br> I won a hobby prize<br> for this setting.<br> And most of these<br> come from Central America.<br> I correspond with a monk<br> who sends me larvae, and...<br> and then I incubate them myself.<br> You see that?<br> This is a leaf butterfy.<br> Looks just like two leaves.<br> These are my chalkhills.<br> And... these are my Adonis blues.<br> I bred that aberration myself.<br> And it's better than any they've got<br> in the Natural History Museum.<br> These are my fritillaries.<br> That's the silver-washed<br> and that's the medium brown...<br> beckerwood, red admiral,<br> swallowtail, peacock.<br> They're beautiful...<br> but sad.<br> How many butterfies<br> have you killed?<br> You can see.<br> Think of all the living beauty<br> you've ended.<br> That's silly.<br> What difference does a few specimens<br> make to a whole species?<br> - Be careful. It's very rare.<br> - Let it go.<br> You're joking.<br> Don't do that!<br> I may never get another one.<br> And now you've collected me,<br> haven't you?<br> Don't you see what's happened?<br> You've had this... this dream<br> with me in the center of it.<br> It's not love. It's the sort<br> of dream young boys have...<br> when they reach puberty,<br> only you've made it come true.<br> I'll tell you something.<br> There'd be a lot more of this if<br> more people had the time and the money.<br> - We all want things we can't have.<br> - We all take what we can get.<br> I never had your advantages.<br> My father wasn't a la-di-da doctor.<br> I never went to a posh school.<br> I was just a clerk in a bank.<br> Reading.<br> Of course!<br> You won a fortune on the pools.<br> You had your picture in the paper.<br> I remember now!<br> You could do so much.<br> You could travel,<br> learn, meet people.<br> You could have a wonderful life.<br> But... this is death,<br> don't you see?<br> Nothing but death.<br> These are dead.<br> I'm dead.<br> Everything here is dead.<br> Is that what you love?<br> Death?<br> It's very good.<br> Would you consider selling it?<br> I hadn't.<br> But I will.<br> Two hundred pounds.<br> All right.<br> You'd give me 200 pounds for this?<br> But it's bad.<br> It's because it's of you.<br> Put it in a drawer<br> with the butterfies.<br> I know why you're upset.<br> It's that letter<br> to your mother, isn't it?<br> I'm going to London this afternoon.<br> I could post it then.<br> I bought these in Woolworths.<br> Nobody will ever be able to trace them.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll dictate it.<br> Dear Mother...<br> I'm safe and not in danger.<br> Do not try to find me.<br> It is impossible.<br> I'm being well looked after<br> by a friend.<br> That's all.<br> Just sign your name.<br> May I say Mr. Franklin<br> sends his regards?<br> Very funny.<br> I'll address the envelope.<br> If you really want one of my drawings,<br> why don't you go and choose one?<br> I like this one.<br> It's yours, for nothing.<br> Would you sign it?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Prisoner...<br> number 1436.<br> "Kidnapped by madman Gerald Franklin.<br> Pools winner.<br> Prisoner in cellar.<br> Old Tudor house, near Reading.<br> So far, safe.<br> Frightened."<br> Frightened?<br> What have I done?<br> And mad?<br> Think a madman would have gone<br> to all this trouble?<br> I'll tell you what a madman<br> would have done.<br> He'd have killed you by now.<br> I suppose you think I'm going for you<br> with a carving knife or something.<br> Don't look like that.<br> I was frightened. You can understand.<br> I'm a prisoner and it frightens me.<br> All that you live for is the day<br> you'll see the last of me.<br> I'm a nobody still, aren't I?<br> But I just want to see the last<br> of this house, not of you.<br> Take me out. We can go together.<br> You could come with me.<br> I won't tell anyone.<br> We'll get you a fat near mine.<br> I'll see you every day.<br> I'll introduce you to all my friends.<br> You could start a new life.<br> Your friends would look<br> down on me like you do.<br> - I don't look down on you.<br> - What about the other night?<br> You didn't even try to understand<br> about my collection.<br> I'm sorry about that.<br> I've seen you with your friends.<br> I know what they're like.<br> You'd be ashamed of me<br> in front of them.<br> - Oh, no, that's not true.<br> - Then why don't you talk to me?<br> You never talk to me,<br> not really.<br> So why should anyone else<br> of your kind?<br> People like you...<br> you just have to walk<br> into a room.<br> You can talk to anyone.<br> You understand things.<br> It's different for people like me.<br> Now, that book you asked me to buy<br> for you, The Catcher in the Rye.<br> Is that a good book?<br> Do you like it?<br> Oh, yes, it's a beautiful book!<br> I've read it three times.<br> Could I understand it?<br> Could I talk to your friends about it?<br> Oh, of course you could!<br> I'll read it.<br> The note wouldn't have<br> done you any good.<br> My name's not really Franklin,<br> and we're nowhere near Reading.<br> I put all the clothes back.<br> And the pictures, well,<br> you can have all of them.<br> You... know today is the last day?<br> I know.<br> At 12:00 tonight.<br> - I read your book.<br> - Oh?<br> Did you like it?<br> Well, I don't see much point<br> in it, really.<br> Why not?<br> I don't believe it,<br> for one thing.<br> That boy...<br> going to a posh school and...<br> his parents having money.<br> He's got no real problem<br> in my opinion.<br> Perhaps you're right.<br> So what right does he have...<br> to behave the way he does?<br> Well, I never looked<br> at it like that.<br> You mean, you never saw<br> the faults in the book before?<br> No, but it's an<br> interesting point of view.<br> Don't patronize me!<br> I'm not, really...<br> You've read that book three times.<br> You told me you loved it.<br> I do, but that doesn't mean...<br> You would never have agreed<br> with anybody else so fast.<br> You would have argued, wouldn't you?<br> You see, you won't really talk to me.<br> That's not true.<br> All right.<br> You tell me what you think<br> is so marvelous about that book.<br> Well... Well, the boy.<br> The way he hates everything<br> that's false. He's so aware.<br> See?<br> He sounds a mess to me.<br> But as a human being,<br> for all his faults...<br> I mean, you felt sorry<br> for him, didn't you?<br> I don't like the way he talks.<br> - Oh, but that's part of his charm.<br> - And the way he behaves.<br> Always talking about people squeezing<br> pimples. You think that's charming?<br> He behaves that way<br> because he doesn't fit anywhere.<br> I don't wonder,<br> the way he carries on.<br> - He didn't try to fit.<br> - You don't understand.<br> No?<br> Well, I mean...<br> you're not trying to see<br> how much like...<br> like all of us he is.<br> Like me. That's what you meant,<br> isn't it?<br> - I don't fit anywhere either.<br> - No, I didn't mean that.<br> - Then I'm too dumb to understand him?<br> - No, I didn't say that either!<br> No, but that's what you meant.<br> You're twisting my words.<br> Am I?<br> That's a good painting,<br> isn't it?<br> Yes, it's a Picasso.<br> People don't look like that.<br> Well, of course they don't.<br> He's not trying to draw<br> a face as it is.<br> He's trying to express a face<br> as he sees it and feels it.<br> - Him seeing it that way makes it good?<br> - But it's not a photograph.<br> - What's wrong with photographs?<br> - Nothing wrong with photographs.<br> - Photographs don't lie!<br> - Neither does this.<br> It's a face from all different angles.<br> It's a character behind the face.<br> It's just a joke, that's all it is.<br> It's just a bad joke.<br> - Because you can't grasp it right away...<br> - Well, how do I grasp it?<br> I'll tell you something<br> about this.<br> It doesn't mean anything!<br> Not just to me.<br> To anybody else.<br> You just say it does because some<br> professor somewhere told you it did!<br> It makes you so superior,<br> you and all your friends.<br> I don't think one-in-a-million,<br> decent, ordinary people...<br> would say this was any good.<br> It's rubbish!<br> Rubbish, that's all it is!<br> And the book, too,<br> that's just as bad.<br> It's filthy!<br> Oh, you're so blooming clever,<br> aren't you?<br> You and all your friends.<br> I can just see me with the lot of you.<br> I'd be a right laugh, wouldn't I?<br> Well, you're not gonna<br> get me in that position.<br> Not... Not you, not anybody, ever!<br> Please!<br> Let's not talk about it anymore.<br> Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, really.<br> Really, I'm sorry.<br> You see...<br> I was right to bring you here.<br> We could never be friends outside.<br> But we can.<br> But we can!<br> We can! Oh, my God!<br> Oh, God, what have I done?<br> What have I done?<br> Oh, let me be free.<br> Please, please, let me be free.<br> I bought you something...<br> for tonight.<br> Your last night...<br> I made some supper upstairs.<br> The dress is... is lovely.<br> Oh, no.<br> That's all over.<br> Why, it's lovely.<br> I bought some champagne<br> and... caviar.<br> You thought of everything.<br> Well, I wanted to<br> do it proper tonight.<br> To us.<br> We've come through,<br> haven't we?<br> You know, you don't have to<br> drive me all the way home.<br> You could drop me off<br> at a station.<br> No, I don't think<br> I could do that.<br> If you're still worried about me<br> telling anyone, you needn't be.<br> I know.<br> I just thought<br> it would be safer for you.<br> No, I'll take you<br> all the way home.<br> All right.<br> I suppose the first thing you'll do<br> when you get back is see that chap.<br> The first thing I'm going to do<br> is call my mother.<br> Thank you.<br> She'll be so relieved.<br> You will be seeing him, though.<br> Oh, no, no.<br> I don't see him all that... often.<br> It'll be lonely here without you.<br> I do want you to come<br> to London, really.<br> It'll be so much better for you.<br> Can we eat now?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Yes, I'm hungry.<br> Thank you.<br> This is how I hoped<br> it always would be.<br> You and me up here,<br> talking, having a nice time.<br> You're not drinking.<br> You said you were hungry.<br> Oh, I am.<br> Marry me.<br> Please marry me.<br> I don't expect anything.<br> I don't expect you to do<br> anything you don't want.<br> You can do what you like...<br> study art.<br> I won't ask anything...<br> anything of you...<br> except you live in the same house<br> and be my wife in name.<br> You can have your own bedroom.<br> You can lock it every night.<br> But that's horrible.<br> Why?<br> I couldn't marry a man I...<br> don't belong to...<br> in every way.<br> I belong to you.<br> I just want you here.<br> I want to be able to see you.<br> Say you'll marry me.<br> Please?<br> Say yes.<br> I'll marry you.<br> I'll marry you<br> as soon as you like.<br> That's what you want,<br> isn't it?<br> We'll stay here.<br> We'll marry and live here.<br> We'll start afresh<br> and get to know each other...<br> right from the beginning again.<br> We don't have to see<br> any of my friends ever.<br> Don't you think I know you need<br> witnesses to get married?<br> But you said you'd let me go.<br> You can't go back on your word.<br> I can do what I like.<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> I brought you<br> some orange juice.<br> I'm sorry about last night.<br> I know I said I'd never<br> use force unless obliged.<br> But you'll admit you did<br> oblige me by what you did.<br> Anyway, I want you<br> to know that...<br> while you were asleep,<br> I didn't take advantage of you.<br> I brought you straight down here.<br> I showed every respect.<br> Wait.<br> I've stayed the four weeks.<br> I just have to have you here<br> a little longer.<br> Why?<br> What more can I do?<br> What more can you want?<br> You know what I want.<br> It's what I've always wanted.<br> You could fall in love with me<br> if you tried.<br> I've done everything I could<br> to make it easy.<br> You just won't try.<br> Must I go straight back<br> to the cellar?<br> Couldn't we sit downstairs<br> for a bit?<br> All right.<br> Is there anything to drink?<br> There's sherry.<br> Could I have another one?<br> Thank you.<br> Why don't you sit down?<br> I'm sorry about<br> our dreadful fight.<br> I'd like us to try<br> and be friends again.<br> I'd like that too.<br> Put your arms around me.<br> Am I too heavy?<br> Kiss me.<br> Not like that.<br> Untie my hands.<br> What's wrong?<br> Nothing's wrong.<br> Come back then.<br> Put the light out.<br> Let's... just have the fire.<br> It's not right.<br> You're just pretending.<br> Why don't you come and see?<br> Look at me.<br> Would I be doing this<br> if I were only pretending?<br> Help me.<br> What is it?<br> You think if we make love<br> I'll have to let you go.<br> Is that what you think?<br> Well, I'm not going to!<br> I thought you wanted me.<br> I just wanted to please you.<br> I can buy what you're talking about<br> in London anytime I like.<br> Get dressed!<br> I used to respect you, but you're<br> no better than the common street woman.<br> You'd do any disgusting thing<br> to get what you want.<br> I'm never getting<br> out of here alive...<br> am I?<br> Help! Help!<br> Oh, don't die.<br> Oh, please don't die!<br> Please don't die!<br> Are you there?<br> Oh, please answer me.<br> Please!<br> Are you there?<br> Oh, God.<br> I've killed him.<br> I've killed him.<br> Oh, I'm so glad.<br> It's been so long.<br> Three...
