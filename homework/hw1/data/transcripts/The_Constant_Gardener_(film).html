A very civilized lunch<br> with Bernard Pellegrin...<br> Who expressed an interest<br> in Tessa's diary.<br> But Tess never kept a diary.<br> She hated the things.<br> You and I know that.<br> Pellegrin must have been disinformed.<br> Tess thought she was being watched.<br> Didn't stop her e-mailing twice a day.<br> More inquiries than Google.<br> Look at him.<br> The boy is two-thirds machine.<br> I'm telling you, it's scary.<br> Mind of a computer.<br> Appetite of a waste disposal.<br> And what's the other third?<br> Oh, Manzini, unquestionably.<br> Those e-mails from Tess<br> Guido helped me with them.<br> Company stuff. Boring.<br> Mm. Ownership, franchises,<br> that sort of thing.<br> I'm trying to find out<br> who brokered the marriage.<br> What marriage?<br> KDH and ThreeBees.<br> KDH make Dypraxa.<br> ThreeBees test it.<br> It's a marriage of convenience, of course.<br> Both in it for what they can get out of it.<br> That phrase about the marriage<br> Is that Tess's phrase or yours?<br> Oh, hers. Hers.<br> Producing dead offspring.<br> Oh, this is so good!<br> Why don't you try some.<br> It looks disgusting.<br> I can get that stuff<br> through her mirror server.<br> Well, how do you do that?<br> All you need is the password. Duh.<br> Yeah, but I don't have her password.<br> Come on, Jus.<br> Five letters. Three guesses.<br> - I have no idea.<br> - My name Guido.<br> She used the one for the "l"<br> and the zero for the "O."<br> - I set it up for her.<br> - Wait, wait.<br> - Give him a chance to read it.<br> - Lightning tour. I'm printing as I go.<br> What's Hippo?<br> German German Pharma Watch.<br> Keep an eye on what<br> the drug companies are up to.<br> Copy that.<br> KDH. Can we open that?<br> Sure. No problem.<br> A new plague is sweeping the world.<br> In the 21 st century, multi-resistant<br> T. B. Will kill one in three.<br> - But now there is hope.<br> - It's huge, isn't it?<br> KDH is developing a revolutionary<br> treatment for T. B. Sufferers.<br> It's global.<br> We call it Dypraxa.<br> You will call it life.<br> And I call it a blockbuster.<br> Karel Delacourt Hudson.<br> The world is our clinic.<br> It's gonna sell like hotcakes.<br> - Can you magnify that photograph?<br> - Magnify it? He can send it out<br> for doughnuts.<br> Is it possible to zoom in on it?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> It's Pellegrin.<br> Why is he there?<br> There's a personal file.<br> Do you mind if I open it?<br> No, sure. Go ahead.<br> Ti amo.<br> So you'd better ask that kind,<br> nice husband of yours to translate.<br> He's got very delicate little ears.<br> He's dreaming<br> about his favorite things.<br> He's dreaming about...<br> A world without any weeds.<br> Justin Quayle,<br> it's time to get up.<br> Go away.<br> You're very annoying.<br> Time to get up, Justin.<br> Get up.<br> This is really just not fair.<br> It's time to get up.<br> Tessa, just let me sleep.<br> There's gardening to be done.<br> Weeds to be pulled out.<br> Good morning.<br> Come back to bed.<br> Good morning.<br> Oh, sweetheart.<br> Moral dilemma, Ham.<br> And the person that I most<br> want to tell can't be told.<br> I had a creepy love letter today.<br> It's not your fault.<br> From a five-star creep.<br> You've got to move on, huh?<br> I've cold-bloodedly led on.<br> I stole something from him.<br> And worse,<br> I made him a vile promise...<br> That I have absolutely<br> no intention ofkeeping.<br> Oh, do come in.<br> Yeah, please. Of course.<br> Thank you.<br> You lead the way.<br> Go ahead. Go ahead.<br> Take a left.<br> I really hate to think how<br> it would hurtJustin ifhe knew.<br> I've violated his code, Ham,<br> In the most cynical way.<br> And the end<br> thatjustifies my means?<br> I need this creep to help me<br> blackmail Her Majesty's government.<br> Please tell me I'm not a ruthless bitch.<br> Please tell me thatJustin<br> would understand ifhe knew.<br> If you give me the wrong answer,<br> then I will push you into the Tiber...<br> Like I did when we were 16.<br> Ciao, my darling.<br> Thank you.<br> For this wonderful gift.<br> How very generous of me.<br> No, l<br> Here, Justin, put this on.<br> I like it here.<br> This is where you work from?<br> Mm.<br> Amnesty.<br> Won't make any difference.<br> That's the official line<br> of the Foreign Office.<br> I thought you were like that.<br> I thought you were one of those<br> privileged revolutionaries.<br> - My lady.<br> - Am I?<br> These plants If they were children,<br> you'd be prosecuted.<br> I do water them.<br> When I remember.<br> You say you're all into saving lives<br> around the world,<br> But you let your poor plants die.<br> I say put people first.<br> Why don't you water them?<br> You're being cruel.<br> I feel safe with you.<br> I can imagine when you were six.<br> You leading the revolution.<br> Ham? Hi. It's Justin.<br> Listen.<br> Do you still represent that<br> dodgy client in Amsterdam?<br> Sorry.<br> Sorry. Sorry. I only just got it.<br> Directions for use.<br> No air travel, no credit cards.<br> Never say your name on the phone,<br> or the computers will kick in.<br> Dodgy client adds,<br> "Welcome to my world."<br> Well, I don't want his world.<br> No choice, old chum.<br> Actually, I'm getting<br> a bit paranoid myself.<br> Look, suppose I posited<br> that all this was just coincidence<br> Tess killed by bandits,<br> pure and simple...<br> And that you're being<br> as paranoid as she was.<br> Ham.<br> Thanks for trying, Ham.<br> I have to finish what she started.<br> Well, look, look. I've got the address<br> of Aunt Claudia, the old bat in Rome.<br> If you need to contact me,<br> you'd better do it through her.<br> She adored Tess.<br> I failed her, Ham.<br> I lost my faith in her.<br> No, she forgives you.<br> She loved you rotten too,<br> you know.<br> You think?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Thank you.<br> It seems our erstwhile colleague<br> has disappeared.<br> Four days ago he lunched<br> in London with Pellegrin,<br> Who describes him as overwrought,<br> after which he visited his wife's lawyer...<br> Before going off our radar.<br> The poor man seems<br> to have convinced himself...<br> There was a conspiracy against Tessa<br> in which we are all complicit.<br> Lfhe has left the U. K.,<br> he did so without a passport.<br> Therefore, any contact from Justin<br> must be reported to me immediately.<br> In his own best interest.<br> No point asking if you've<br> heard from him, I suppose?<br> No, no, Tim, none at all.<br> Birgit, why are ThreeBees spending<br> $70 million testing Dypraxa for KDH?<br> I mean, is the African market<br> worth that much?<br> Tessa, you have to understand<br> the scale of this.<br> There is a T. B. Epidemic coming.<br> It will affect the entire world.<br> Or, put into the language that stock<br> exchanges all over the world understand,<br> If the T. B. Market performs as forecast,<br> Billions and billions of dollars<br> are waiting to be earned.<br> And the boy to earn them is Dypraxa.<br> Lf, of course,<br> the preliminary trials in Africa...<br> Have not thrown up<br> any disturbing side effects.<br> Ich suche Birgit.<br> Ich bin Justin Quayle,<br> Tessa Quayle's Ehemann.<br> - Michael Adams.<br> Okay, Herr Adams.<br> She collects Karl at 3:00<br> from the kindergarten at Bahnhofstrasse.<br> Karl, here.<br> Birgit.<br> You sent this to my wife.<br> Justin.<br> I need to talk to you.<br> Our computers<br> were stolen last night.<br> Yes, I know.<br> They have never gone<br> this far before.<br> I can't be seen with you.<br> Sorry. I've Karl to think of.<br> Is there some safe place<br> we could talk?<br> Nowhere. Nowhere safe.<br> Nowhere?<br> Please. Just... a few questions.<br> Okay, let's talk here.<br> With these people.<br> All right.<br> Okay. My bike's across the street.<br> Ask your questions before we get to it.<br> Is it a scam?<br> Scam?<br> Dypraxa.<br> Does it cure T. B.?<br> Yes, it cures.<br> But it can also kill, you know,<br> because they haven't got<br> the formula right.<br> Right. So why don't they work on that?<br> It's cheaper to fix the trials.<br> Exclude the patients that<br> have side effects, you know.<br> To go back to the lab would<br> cost them time two years<br> Millions of dollars, and other companies<br> would have time to produce their own cures.<br> Okay, next question.<br> You said to Tessa in your e-mails<br> that the Kenyan government<br> had approved the trials.<br> Somebody bribed them.<br> Who?<br> ThreeBees, Lorbeer.<br> We don't know.<br> But $50,000 in the right hands,<br> and you can test battery acid<br> as skin lotion.<br> My bike's there.<br> Stop! Stop!<br> - Stop!<br> Who is Lorbeer?<br> Birgit, is it a company?<br> A white coat.<br> He invented Dypraxa.<br> When patients started to die,<br> Lorbeerjumped clear.<br> Is that why Tessa went to Lokichogio?<br> Is that where Lorbeer is?<br> Disappeared.<br> Murdered?<br> Disappeared.<br> We've gotta go. I'm sorry.<br> Where can I find him?<br> Birgit? Where?<br> Go back to Africa.<br> Lorbeer's still there.<br> Tessa, why didn't you tell me?<br> I could have helped you.<br> It is my sad duty to inform you<br> that Dr. Bluhm has been found.<br> I'll spare you the details.<br> Suffice to say, the poor fellow...<br> Seems to have been tortured to death<br> on the same day Tessa was killed.<br> Which would seem to exonerate him.<br> Seem? So what's the new theory?<br> That he tortured himself to death?<br> That'd save you looking<br> for anyone else, wouldn't it?<br> Moving on.<br> What is the purpose of your visit?<br> I'm seeing a friend.<br> Welcome to Kenya, Mr. Black.<br> Thank you.<br> Has anyone seen<br> ThreeBees' share price lately?<br> Does that mean he won't be able<br> to contribute to tombola?<br> Hardly Kenny's fault if someone<br> put the word out on him.<br> Wish I'd know that's all it took.<br> I'd have done it sooner.<br> I expect he'll land on his feet.<br> Give him a life peerage.<br> Henceforth you shall be known as<br> Lord fucking Curtiss of fucking Kenya.<br> Whoever you are, I don't<br> take kindly to being blackmailed.<br> Christ. How did you get here?<br> Safari tour. Via Paris.<br> Hunting me now, Justin?<br> You're the one on the run.<br> I loved her.<br> I'm not ashamed of it.<br> Nor should you be...<br> if it were true.<br> It's not for you to tell me<br> how I felt.<br> If you've read that, you'll see<br> that I let her read something<br> she shouldn't.<br> Yeah. A letter from Pellegrin.<br> She trusted you.<br> What do you want for that?<br> I want to know why Pellegrin<br> suppressed Tessa's report.<br> It was him, wasn't it?<br> Don't try and play detective.<br> ThreeBees, KDH, Dypraxa.<br> What's the story on that axis of evil?<br> KDH is Swiss-Canadian.<br> So why are we involved?<br> Curtiss is one of us.<br> He's British.<br> Christ, Justin, stop bleeding<br> for bloody Africa<br> and show some loyalty.<br> That plant KDH built in Wales<br> could have gone to France.<br> Fifteen hundred jobs<br> in a depressed region.<br> We owed them.<br> They needed help<br> with the Dypraxa trials.<br> KDH needed<br> an investment partner here.<br> Curtiss and ThreeBees<br> served us both.<br> And Tessa wanted what?<br> Pressure on Kenny...<br> To stop the tests,<br> redesign the bloody drug.<br> Three years' delay,<br> millions of dollars.<br> Or?<br> We're not paid<br> to be bleeding hearts.<br> You know that, Justin.<br> We're not killing people<br> who wouldn't be dead otherwise.<br> Look at the death rate.<br> Not that anybody's counting.<br> But you were<br> a bleeding heart, Sandy.<br> Tessa was your salvation,<br> wasn't she, from all this?<br> You loved her. Remember?<br> Pellegrin said the report<br> was too damaging...<br> And she had to be stopped.<br> Oh, yes. She was stopped.<br> I betrayed her.<br> We all did.<br> You did it by... growing flowers.<br> How did you betray her, Sandy?<br> They wanted to know<br> what she was up to.<br> I'm the one who told them<br> she was going to Loki.<br> - Who did you tell?<br> - Pellegrin.<br> But God knows who he told.<br> Ghita, get in the car.<br> Get in the car!<br> - Go!<br> Get in.<br> Listen, fuckhead,<br> if I wanted you dead,<br> I would've brought Crick with me.<br> I wanna show you something.<br> Show me from there.<br> Don't mess me about.<br> I'm doing you a favor.<br> How did you know where I'd be?<br> I've still got a friend or two, you know?<br> We're marked men, Quayle.<br> They've called in my fucking bank loans.<br> I'm finished.<br> They want you silenced.<br> And they want another country's flag<br> flying over my pharma division.<br> So, you've been asking<br> about Wanza Kilulu.<br> She's under there,<br> covered in quicklime.<br> Her and 62 others<br> who never officially existed.<br> Dypraxa?<br> Yeah.<br> Is that where I'm going?<br> Not on my agenda.<br> Then why are you<br> showing me this?<br> Let's just say<br> if I'm going to the wall,<br> I want a trophy.<br> That's what you lot do,<br> isn't it? Heads on walls.<br> I think I'll have Pellegrin's<br> fucking head on mine.<br> So, now you know where it is.<br> I'm not taking any fucking questions.<br> What about Lorbeer?<br> That Bible-thumping bullshitter,<br> he's doing his penance in the Sudan.<br> Jesus the healer.<br> You don't know where I'm going?<br> You get one guess.<br> I'm gonna surprise you, Tess.<br> - I love this man.<br> - Hello.<br> I wish you had shared<br> just a few things.<br> I love you.<br> I love you too.<br> Who did you think it was?<br> Fuck you, Donohue.<br> This is bandit country.<br> Did you tell Curtiss where I'd be?<br> Ghita's car?<br> Well, Ghita's<br> my only friend here, Tim.<br> I wouldn't want her<br> to get into trouble.<br> She won't.<br> You do have another friend,<br> believe it or not.<br> You won't find what<br> you're looking for in Loki.<br> Let's be honest<br> with each other, shall we?<br> That's a a late career change<br> for you, Tim.<br> There's something else<br> we have in common, you and I.<br> We'll both be dead by Christmas.<br> There's a contract out on you.<br> Same people who did for Tessa,<br> I shouldn't wonder.<br> Mine's cancer.<br> My pain is controllable.<br> I knew that you were ill.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't realize.<br> Yeah. Sandy tell you?<br> He fingered Tessa.<br> He said he'd made a phone call.<br> He didn't know they'd kill her.<br> Silly sod was besotted with her.<br> But that's the way it works<br> with corporate murder.<br> Boss gets wind of something,<br> calls in his head of security,<br> Who talks to someone,<br> who talks to a friend of someone.<br> Finishes up with an answering machine<br> in a rented office,<br> A couple of sensitive gentlemen<br> in a blue pickup truck.<br> They will never know<br> who ordered the hit.<br> I can get you out of Kenya.<br> It's one of the few things<br> we still do well.<br> Drop it now, and it's over.<br> I'll make sure word<br> gets to the right people.<br> Go home... and live.<br> But I don't have a home, Tim.<br> Tessa was my home.<br> Know about Bluhm?<br> What about Bluhm?<br> Let me tell you<br> what you're facing.<br> They dragged him into the desert,<br> cut out his tongue,<br> Chopped offhis manly apparatus<br> and stuffed them where his tongue had been.<br> Then they crucified the poor bugger.<br> Pathologist's opinion is<br> he was still alive when they nailed him up.<br> Of course, you might be lucky.<br> It might be in their interest<br> to make yours look like suicide.<br> Which it is.<br> Balance of mind disturbed.<br> No fuss, no inquiry.<br> Nothing.<br> Right.<br> Well, thank you for the warning.<br> You've been very kind.<br> I was afraid you'd say that.<br> In case you meet any bandits.<br> I, uh I wondered<br> if you could help me.<br> Yes, sir?<br> Thank you for agreeing<br> to take me, Mr. <br> Please. I can't hear you.<br> Please put these on.<br> I said thank you<br> for taking me, Mr. Andika.<br> Jonah.
