                        I have telephoned<br> all over Brussels for you.<br> What kind of a husband are you<br> to desert your wife like this?<br> I walked from the office<br> by way of the park.<br> And while you walked in the park<br> I had to send for Dr. Renee.<br> Because you're ill?<br> No, Mr. Dodd had a letter from<br> the papers from London.<br> A boarder gets a letter,<br> so, you send for the doctor?<br> I thought he'd go insane!<br> He threw his piano<br> over on the floor.<br> Tore up his music. All of it.<br> The work of a year.<br> Good. We shall not hear it again.<br> He shouted out loud that he was<br> no longer a composer.<br> I would have shouted it to him<br> long before...<br> ...if boarders were easy to find.<br> He said he was no longer<br> a composer, but a mechanic.<br> A mechanic? Maybe he is.<br> I'll go up.<br> Tell me, my dear doctor,<br> do you know the difference...<br> ...between a consonance<br> and a dissonance?<br> I'm a doctor of medicine,<br> not a doctor of music.<br> I don't like doctors,<br> I don't need doctors.<br> -What do you need, Mr. Dodd?<br> -Nothing. I have everything.<br> This is very inconvenient.<br> I have patients at the hospital.<br> -Why am I here?<br> -Why are any of us here, doctor?<br> I don't know why<br> we're here now...<br> ...but I know why<br> you won't be here tomorrow.<br> Marie and I will require<br> this room.<br> Georges, you will consult me<br> about that.<br> I've decided!<br> The house is in my charge!<br> That is my piano<br> and this is my chair!<br> Is there any insanity<br> in your family, Mr. Dodd?<br> I have no family, how could I have<br> any insanity in it?<br> My dear doctor,<br> I'd like to pay you,<br> to thank you and<br> say good-bye.<br> It is my opinion that you are<br> much more than slightly mad.<br> -Thank you, doctor.<br> -Adieu.<br> Good-bye.<br> Before you put<br> that money back,<br> will you glance at this piano?<br> It's broken.<br> Can no one be right but me?<br> What would calm you, Mr. Dodd?<br> I don't know.<br> Brandy will not calm you.<br> And you're smoking all the time.<br> -You received something from England.<br> -Oh, yes, from London.<br> As you know, my symphony was presented<br> at Regents Hall in London last week.<br> -Remember?<br> -Yes, it was very strange music.<br> Did you ever tell me it was strange?<br> You heard it?<br> -We heard it so many times.<br> -I see.<br> And it made you uncomfortable.<br> -Oh, no, no...<br> -Yes, why should we be afraid?<br> Georges is right,<br> listen to this.<br> This is the foremost<br> music critic in London:<br> "It is inconceivable<br> to this critic..."<br> "...that a program as delicately<br> conceived as this..."<br> "...should be mire by the rude intrusion<br> of uncomfortable dissonance."<br> They were uncomfortable, Georges,<br> and so were you.<br> It must be that I was uncomfortable<br> and I conveyed it through my music.<br> But, we try to make you<br> comfortable here.<br> You worked for<br> a whole year!<br> That's right, a year, to become<br> a mechanic. Listen to this:<br> "However, it is to be considered<br> that Mr. Dodd,"<br> "the brilliant, young,<br> Belgium modernist,"<br> has accomplished a series of<br> tonal mechanics."<br> Now, you see?<br> I am a mechanic!<br> -There was another foreign letter.<br> -I didn't see it.<br> Yes, two of them.<br> One from London and<br> one from Switzerland.<br> Switzerland? The Sangers!<br> -What about dinner, Marie?<br> -What about dinner, Marie?<br> Every Christmas,<br> when you go to the Sanger,<br> you come back so changed<br> and so gay.<br> Well, I've known them<br> since they were babies.<br> I've seen them grow up.<br> Your Dr. Renee should meet them.<br> There he would find insanity<br> of the most enchanting kind.<br> Good place for you to go.<br> -Oh, Georges, please...<br> What about dinner, Marie?<br> Ah, poor Sanger.<br> -Mr. Dodd.<br> -Mm?<br> You remember you wrote a song<br> for the Sanger children?<br> -A little song?<br> -Mm-hmm, but you did not send it.<br> Oh, that. It was too sad.<br> They're so gay, I threw it away.<br> No, I found it in the rubbish.<br> -Here it is.<br> -You did! Look.<br> Cello for Kate.<br> She's the eldest.<br> Violin for Paula. Little Paula,<br> she's the youngest.<br> Piano for Toni...<br> ...and viola for Tessa,<br> the pick of the bunch.<br> And the mother?<br> They all have different mothers,<br> except Paula and Tessa.<br> Yes, these two share<br> the same mother.<br> And what has Mr. Sanger besides<br> children and all their mothers?<br> A genius for music and<br> a new Russian wife.<br> -He's rich?<br> -Tremendously rich.<br> So much so, sometimes he hasn't got<br> enough money to buy food.<br> Yet, they live in a chalet<br> in Switzerland.<br> Yes, a beautiful dilapidated spot.<br> I must go there tonight,<br> I can't wait.<br> Give Georges a hug, a kiss and<br> tell him not to be angry.<br> And ask him to send a telegram<br> for me, to Albert Sanger.<br> Here's the address.<br> "Arriving Wednesday, kill a pig and<br> buy some decent brandy. Lewis."<br> Thank you, Marie.<br> What's the matter, Roberto?<br> What is it?<br> "Arriving Wednesday, kill a pig and<br> buy some decent brandy. Lewis."<br> My God, I've been swimming and<br> I got my hair wet! Oh...!<br> Kate!<br> Kate! Kate!<br> -You'll wake your father.<br> -He's coming! Lewis is coming!<br> He says: "kill a pig<br> a buy some decent brandy"!<br> There, yeah, brandy.<br> -For Mr. Sanger.<br> -Give it to me.<br> I'll get his room ready<br> with some lovely flowers--<br> No, we have another guest coming,<br> a Mr... Mr. Trigorin.<br> He must have that room and--<br> Lewis must go to the stable loft.<br> Oh, God, I got my hair wet--<br> It'll dry in the sun!<br> Get Paula, you'll both help me<br> with the rooms.<br> Paula!<br> Paula!<br> Quiet, you'll wake your father.<br> Who cares?<br> You've broken my spine,<br> I suppose you know that.<br> -Lewis is coming.<br> -When?<br> Any minute.<br> That ribbon happens to belong to me.<br> -Where's mine?<br> -I don't know.<br> Hurry up if you want to come<br> to meet Lewis.<br> He'll be here any minute!<br> I don't want to stay here<br> with you, you drunken...<br> ...pig! Drunken pig!<br> He's a drunken pig.<br> It's my father<br> you're talking about.<br> My husband.<br> Kate!<br> -Kate, any coffee apart?<br> -Please, Lina--<br> Tessa, take this up to father...<br> ...and tell him about Lewis<br> and Mr. Trigorin.<br> -Lend me that ribbon, will you?<br> -Your hair is pretty without it.<br> -You had stomach-ache yesterday.<br> -It's better today.<br> Here, fasten me up.<br> -What's the matter with you, Tessa?<br> -Lewis is coming!<br> I've got my hair wet and<br> I can't find my ribbon!<br> -Where is it?<br> -I don't know.<br> -Here, take this one.<br> -Thank you, Kate, I'll return it.<br> Take this and don't drop it.<br> -What about Lewis' brandy?<br> -I put out half of it. Go on!<br> Who's there?<br> It's Tessa, father.<br> I'm afraid you'll have to<br> add a little water.<br> Roberto could only get one bottle.<br> We owe so much.<br> Lewis Dodd's coming today.<br> He sent us a telegram.<br> Lewis Dodd, yes, I--<br> I wrote to him.<br> Father, would you do me<br> a favor?<br> What?<br> Would you let me trim<br> your hair up a bit?<br> Lewis will think no one<br> takes care of you.<br> -No!<br> -Oh, come on, please.<br> What're you going to call it?<br> "A Little Girl Cutting<br> Her Father's Hair".<br> No, no!<br> -Father?<br> -Uh?<br> -Would you tell me something?<br> -Mm-hmm.<br> Is Lewis Dodd a really<br> very fine musician?<br> Good technique.<br> He's like the weather.<br> Today is thunders,<br> tomorrow is sunny.<br> Like children playing.<br> But there's no blood pulsing<br> through his music, no heart.<br> It's the new school<br> that's coming in.<br> If he'd only cry.<br> He ever really laughs,<br> I'm sure he couldn't cry.<br> If he'd fall in love, if some woman<br> could disturb him.<br> I'm sure he's never known<br> a woman.<br> If he could suffer,<br> that's what I mean.<br> What would make him suffer?<br> I don't know.<br> That's something that happens<br> to all of us.<br> Father, listen.<br> It's Lewis!<br> He's here!<br> Paula!<br> Paula, come on!<br> Didn't you hear Lewis?<br> Lewis Dodd!<br> Lewis Dodd!<br> -You're actually here!<br> -How are you, darling?<br> Hello, Tessa!<br> I've been swimming,<br> I've got my hair wet.<br> I wish you kids<br> would stop growing.<br> You make me feel very old!<br> You're growing up like sting weeds.<br> That's not very nice of you, Lewis.<br> Oh! What have you got there?<br> And those beautiful bags?<br> That's Mr. Trigorin.<br> The bags are his.<br> -Where did you find him?<br> -He's come to visit your father.<br> Mr. Trigorin staged a ballet<br> from one of your father's operas.<br> You are the charming daughters<br> of Mr. Sanger?<br> This is Paula.<br> And this--<br> this here is Tessa,<br> the pick of the bunch.<br> Girls, welcome your guest, please.<br> He looks like a flea trainer.<br> -Welcome.<br> -How long will you stay?<br> See what I mean, Mr. Trigorin?<br> They're charming little ladies.<br> -Ah, signore!<br> -Roberto, nice to see you!<br> Please, bring up these bags,<br> will you?<br> Oh, where is Toni?<br> -No, Tessie, you can't tell it.<br> -Of course, I can.<br> Lewis is part of this house.<br> Arent'you, Lewis?<br> What're you talking about?<br> Where's Toni?<br> Toni went to Zurich and<br> she wrote us a postcard.<br> She said she was staying with friends<br> only, we don't believe it.<br> Father's furious and says he'll<br> beat her when she gets back--<br> Wait, wait, one at a time.<br> You mean our mad little Toni...<br> ...has become a "bad little Toni"?<br> Yes, and we think Fritz Bercovy<br> is at the bottom of it.<br> -We don't know, we're very upset.<br> -Who's Bercovy?<br> Fritz Bercovy, he's very rich,<br> he owns ten theatres now.<br> -Oh, little Fritz...<br> -It's very disturbing, Lewis!<br> -Yes, I know. She'll be back.<br> -We hope so...<br> -Oh, good morning, dear Lina!<br> -Madame Sanger.<br> Yes, sorry, Mme. Sanger.<br> -I've got a gift for you.<br> -A gift?<br> A beautiful and plump one.<br> It's waiting for you<br> on the patio.<br> -His name is Trigorin.<br> -Oh, Trigorin!<br> I know him from<br> Saint Petersburg. Trigorin!<br> She's driving Sanger mad.<br> I think he'd be glad...<br> -...if she left him.<br> -I don't know about that.<br> Children, please.<br> -Where do I sleep?<br> -In the loft.<br> Mr. Trigorin has<br> the guest room.<br> -Only if you'd take the other bed.<br> -With a flea trainer?<br> On the loft!<br> -May we help you--?<br> -No, darling, I'm sorry...<br> ...but I'm dead.<br> I'm going to sleep.<br> Oh, if Sanger calls me, wake me...<br> (Thank you, darling.)<br> -...but gently.<br> -Yes, I will.<br> Here, let me do your hair.<br> Sanger said today that Lewis<br> was like the weather.<br> That if he never really cried,<br> he'd never be really great.<br> What do you think<br> could make him cry?<br> He must've been in love<br> and cried about that.<br> -He's never been in love.<br> -How do you know?<br> He may know<br> a lot of things but...<br> ...he's never known real love<br> any more than we have.<br> -How do you know?<br> -I know.<br> There're things nobody has<br> to tell you about, you just know.<br> The way you moon over him is enough<br> to turn one's stomach.<br> I love Lewis, he's mine.<br> Do you think he knows about it?<br> I don't think he knows now, but...<br> ...one day, he'll look at me<br> and he'll say:<br> "Darling, darling Tessa..."<br> And everything'll be all right.<br> -And you'll faint.<br> -Into his arms, probably.<br> And he'll be very glad because<br> he needs someone like me.<br> -Will you keep house for him?<br> -Of course I will.<br> Nobody on earth could be<br> more untidy than you.<br> Yes, except Lewis, so,<br> it'll be all right.<br> Shall you be engaged<br> or just married?<br> I'll be his very own wife and<br> love him as long as I live.<br> -Look, Tess, Toni!<br> -Where?<br> -Come on!<br> -Toni's back!<br> Toni!<br> Toni!<br> Toni!<br> Where did you get that hat?<br> -Hello, Tessa.<br> -Toni, you're b-- you're back.<br> -Of course, I'm back.<br> -Lewis is here.<br> -Lewis? Where?<br> -In the loft.<br> Kate!<br> Kate, Toni's back!<br> Toni's back!<br> -Hello!<br> -Hello, darling!<br> Kate, I'm back.<br> So I see.<br> If everyone's going to look<br> like that, I'm going.<br> Toni, may I ask<br> what is upon your head?<br> -The latest style. Zurich.<br> -Zurich? Oh!<br> -For a whole week!<br> -Did you have a good time?<br> I had a lovely time.<br> Anything I said I wanted,<br> Fritz got it for me.<br> -Fritz? Fritz Bercovy?<br> -Fritz, yes!<br> We had lovely meals.<br> -Not at Fritz's house?<br> -Of course not.<br> At the Splendid,<br> the best hotel.<br> Last night we had asparagus,<br> and lobsters...<br> -...and iced bombes and peaches...<br> -Did it make you sick?<br> Fritz had a saddle of mutton<br> and we had champagne.<br> We had champagne every night.<br> Did he buy you that hat?<br> No, I bought it<br> with my own money.<br> -Do you like it, Lewis?<br> -Superb.<br> It's large, but it suits you.<br> What have you done<br> to your hair?<br> -I had it dressed.<br> -Lovely.<br> -Sanger says he'll beat you.<br> -What will you tell him?<br> -The truth.<br> -What is the truth, Toni?<br> Anything you'd prefer to think<br> if that amuses you.<br> I know I did nothing<br> to be ashamed of.<br> Oh, we're all quite sure of that.<br> Fritz bought me a dozen<br> pairs of stokings.<br> All silk, every shade.<br> You took clothes from him,<br> how common.<br> Wrong, I threw them<br> out the window.<br> -I asked him what he took me for.<br> -Good for you, Toni.<br> They got caught on<br> the telephone wires.<br> People in the street looked<br> so surprised!<br> It was windy and they waved<br> like little flags.<br> I laughed so hard I nearly<br> fell out of the window myself!<br> -Fritz hated to see his money wasted.<br> -You sound as if you hated him.<br> I don't hate him.<br> I made him understand<br> he was mistaken about me.<br> I was so hurt...<br> ...because I--<br> I really thought<br> he liked me decently.<br> Don't cry, Toni.<br> We knew nothing<br> could happen to you.<br> But you're home now,<br> and we love you.<br> Oh, Toni, darling.<br> No man is worth a single one<br> of your tears.<br> Come, Toni.<br> Toni, don't cry.<br> Don't worry about Toni.<br> -Are you sure she's all right?<br> -I'm sure she is.<br> Thanks.<br> -Sanger's awake now.<br> -Good. I'll talk to him.<br> Hey, Lewis, don't tell us<br> you've been working!<br> -For the little girls Sanger only.<br> -Little girls...<br> When I make a promise<br> I keep it.<br> Composed specially for<br> the Sanger circus. You see,<br> I made it very simple,<br> so that you'd have no difficulty<br> in playing it.<br> -Isn't it rather sad?<br> -No comments from you.<br> Learn it. I'm going<br> to your father.<br> "When thou art dead,<br> the birds will stop their singing."<br> -It doesn't sound like Lewis at all.<br> -It's a nice melody.<br> "When thou art dead,<br> the birds will stop their singing."<br> "When thou art cold,<br> no sun will ever rise."<br> -Come on, let's learn it!<br> -"No more, no more..."<br> "...the joyful days upspringing<br> shall bless these eyes."<br> "When thou art in the grave<br> the flowers blowing..."<br> "...shall hang their heads..."<br> Sanger?<br> -Where have you been?<br> -Waiting for you to wake up.<br> Pull that shutter, too.<br> If that mountain could be moved...<br> ...the sun wouldn't come<br> blinding in here all day.<br> Where would you like it<br> moved to?<br> Over my grave.<br> I'd like a mountain<br> for a monument.<br> What would I print<br> for an epitaph?<br> Pull up a chair.<br> About the epitaph,<br> let it just say...<br> ..."Albert Sanger,<br> a dirty old man."<br> No, no, I would say...<br> ..."Albert Sanger, musician<br> and genius."<br> And then, if you like,<br> I could add...<br> "He was, also, a dirty old man."<br> No, thanks.<br> Tell me,<br> -What about your concert in London?<br> -It didn't go.<br> As the English say,<br> it flopped.<br> It made them uncomfortable.<br> Oh, by the way, your daughter<br> Toni is back.<br> Antonia? Oh, yes, she went--<br> Did she tell you were she went?<br> Yes, yes, and she was completely<br> innocent, I'm sure of that.<br> What's going to happen to<br> the children when I'm gone?<br> Lewis, I'm helpless.<br> I haven't got 20 pounds.<br> Didn't Paula's and Tessa's mother<br> have people in England?<br> Oh, yes.<br> When I ran out with their daughter,<br> Evelyn Creighton, their mother,<br> the Creighton family<br> disowned her.<br> There was a time when her brother,<br> Charles, hunted us all over Europe.<br> His idea was to shoot me on sight,<br> the American fashion,<br> and take the sister Evelyn back.<br> Then, the children came.<br> He gave up the hunting,<br> forgot us.<br> But this brother, Charles,<br> still alive?<br> You know this kind of people.<br> Good old Boston type.<br> Lewis,<br> if anything happened to me,<br> look up for this Creighton family.<br> They're very rich, get them<br> to do something for the children.<br> -They should go to school.<br> -I know, I know.<br> Oh, by the way,<br> you've got a guest.<br> -Trigorin.<br> -Keep him away from me!<br> Little monkeys.<br> -What is that music?<br> -Mine, I'm afraid.<br> Just a trifle I brought<br> for the children.<br> You mean, you wrote it?<br> It's nothing at all.<br> Leave the door open,<br> I want to listen to it.<br> Sugar candy.<br> It's very nice.<br> Nice, yes... nice.<br> You're ashamed of<br> melody, aren't you?<br> No, I have no gift for it.<br> Shut that door.<br> If you'd done that in London<br> you wouldn't have failed.<br> What?<br> -That is me?<br> -That is you.<br> Oh, if I could only<br> make you understand.<br> What would I make of it?<br> A love scene in an opera!<br> A symphonic poem,<br> what you will!<br> Go away, and tell Kate<br> to bring me some more brandy.<br> Mr. Bercovy, don't try to explain.<br> It's a disgrace.<br> Toni is a child!<br> But-but, please, madame,<br> try to understand me, I--<br> Madame, you're laboring<br> on a misapprehension!<br> We know all about it, Fritz!<br> Lewis! It's so nice<br> to see you.<br> Hello, Fritz, you look<br> very well!<br> Lewis, from man to man,<br> I must see Antonia.<br> From man to man, I doubt<br> that she will see you.<br> -No?<br> -You see, she's a little hurt.<br> My boy, the next time you ask<br> a young lady to Zurich...<br> ...pick somenone less sophisticated<br> than the Sanger ladies.<br> Fritzie, I'm surprised at you!<br> But, Lewis, honestly,<br> from man to man,<br> I had no bad intentions.<br> I'm very fond of Toni.<br> So are we all.<br> Remember that, Mr. Bercovy.<br> Hey, there! What's the matter?<br> This is terrible. Sanger said<br> it was a very nice little piece.<br> -It is charming!<br> -Really?<br> -What's he doing at the piano?<br> -He plays.<br> Yes! Trigorin plays very well<br> for a flea trainer.<br> A flea trainer?<br> Paula, please!<br> -He knows, we told him.<br> -Oh, you did.<br> Very sad, Lewis,<br> but quite playable.<br> Thank you, Kate.<br> Sanger said it would make<br> a symphonic poem, but...<br> ...somehow, I can't quite<br> agree with him.<br> Father instincts are<br> usually right.<br> Let's try it.<br> Where's your viola, Tessa?<br> I learnt it all perfectly<br> and I broke the strings.<br> Aw... Come on, let's hear it.<br> Ready?<br> No, no. Let's get together.<br> Nice on key. Paula.<br> "When thou art dead,"<br> "the birds will stop<br> their singing."<br> "When thou art cold,"<br> "no sun will ever rise."<br> "No more, no more the joyful<br> days upspringing..."<br> "...shall bless these eyes."<br> #Ah, say not so...#<br> Go ahead, sing it.<br> #When I am in my grave,#<br> #the flowers blowing<br> shall make thee garlands...#<br> #...twenty times as sweet.#<br> Beauty will live.<br> #Beauty will live...#<br> #...though I must sleep...#<br> #...unknowing...#<br> -Beneath thy feet.<br> #...beneath thy feet...#<br> #...beneath thy feet.#<br> Very pretty, darling.<br> Tessa!<br> Tessa!<br> -Why did you run away like that?<br> -I don't know.<br> It's quiet here, isn't it?<br> Yes, you hear things<br> in this kind of silence.<br> What do you hear?<br> -This is where I think out my words.<br> -Oh, poetry?<br> -No, just thoughts, I can't explain.<br> -Tell me one thought.<br> -You'll laugh.<br> -No, I won't laugh.<br> Well, there's so many, but,<br> sad things, like your music.<br> "I have tonight<br> a quiet desire to die."<br> "I have no tide of<br> exit note to leave."<br> "O, in this wound-cut earth to lie,"<br> "O, if they would not grieve."<br> "I have tonight a quiet desire."<br> You liked that?<br> Oh, it's very pretty,<br> but, you want to die?<br> I'm not in the least<br> anxious to die.<br> When I see troubles, I always<br> want to run away from them.<br> -Then you'd better run away from me.<br> -Oh, I'll never do that!<br> Really?<br> You're such a graceless<br> little baggage.<br> Strangely innocent.<br> I've got to talk to you.<br> -Why?<br> -Too many Frtizes around.<br> You know, you've got<br> to be protected.<br> Protected?

Find her.<br> Toni! Fritz is going to marry you!<br> Florence is very beautiful.<br> She is beautiful but she is<br> so sure about everything.<br> You think she is sure of Lewis?<br> I wouldn't be surprised<br> if she bewitched him.<br> Poor Tess.<br> When you love someone<br> as I love Lewis...<br> ...you've just got to<br> understand things.<br> Florence is only beautiful and<br> she just happens to be here but--<br> Secrets?<br> Hello, Florence.<br> -Did you find any primula?<br> -No, they grow over by the lake...<br> ...and we didn't have time<br> to get any before breakfast.<br> We'll get Lewis<br> to raw us over later.<br> I can't wait to take you to England<br> and buy you some decent clothes.<br> Well, we don't yet know whether<br> we're sure we want to go.<br> And I'm not so sure you aren't<br> too young to know what's good for you.<br> You see, we're too young for<br> some things, we're too old for others,<br> -we're in between, you know.<br> -Yes, I've been through that stage.<br> Hi.<br> Have you been behaving, girls?<br> Really, Lewis, sometimes<br> you can be very pompous.<br> I hope that's put you<br> in your place, Mr. Dodd.<br> I think we should go<br> and get the flowers.<br> Get plenty of flowers and put them<br> in a vase in the middle of the table.<br> -Yes, we know.<br> -Come on!<br> Come on.<br> What's the matter? You have<br> a funny look on your face.<br> -Funny?<br> -You're a fool.<br> The fool is wondering.<br> You look like a man<br> who's wondered a lot.<br> Mm-hmm. A little hopelessly<br> I'm afraid.<br> From what I've heard of musicians,<br> you're all the same.<br> Strange and a little<br> off-the-earth.<br> -I've come to the earth, suddenly.<br> -Do you like it?<br> -Do I like you?<br> -I didn't mean that.<br> I mean, being on the earth,<br> out of your clouds.<br> I do, I do like it very much.<br> But I'd like to take you back<br> to my clouds with me.<br> When do you leave, sir?<br> At your word.<br> This is becoming very pretty<br> and very gallant.<br> I mean it, very much.<br> You must've had a great success<br> with this method of approach.<br> No, I've had no success<br> whatever. Ever.<br> Poor Mr. Dodd. I'm not going to<br> attempt to believe you.<br> What woman could resist<br> a trip to the clouds...<br> -... with someone as...?<br> -Mm-hmm?<br> -I'm stumped.<br> -Oh, you mean,<br> someone who wanted to kiss you<br> the minute you got off that train?<br> -To kiss?<br> -Uh-huh.<br> A beautiful woman<br> gets off the train...<br> ...to rescue some girls,<br> and a poor musician...<br> ...wants to take her<br> into his arms and kiss her.<br> And they lived happily everafter.<br> You know they could.<br> I swear they could.<br> -I will, I think.<br> -What?<br> Live happily.<br> Florence!<br> Why do you think I stayed<br> up here this whole week?<br> I don't know. Why?<br> Tell me, I want to hear.<br> I wanted to find my way<br> up to you in your clouds.<br> See, I'm not exactly<br> the cloudy type.<br> I didn't know my way<br> until you told me.<br> You're so real,<br> so definite.<br> Is that what you like?<br> It's what I love.<br> Oh, Paula, darling--<br> Lewis, I--<br> I'm sorry, but--<br> Come here.<br> Breakfast is ready and--<br> Uncle Charles is screaming<br> for everyone.<br> Mm, yes.<br> Paula, my lamb,<br> I have news for you.<br> Florence and I are going to<br> get married.<br> Are you?<br> Yes.<br> But you scarcely know each other.<br> Don't be such a little woman.<br> Do I sense competition here?<br> Quite possibly.<br> Suppose you run along, young lady,<br> and have those hands washed.<br> Certainly.<br> Tessa!<br> Tessa!<br> Uncle Charles, have you seen Tessa?<br> Oh, Tessa, she was here<br> a moment ago...<br> ...messing about with some flowers.<br> I'm famish!<br> Where are the others?<br> Robert-o!<br> Tessa!<br> Tessa.<br> -Have you seen Tessa?<br> -I came in just now, Miss.<br> -Roberto, have you seen her?<br> -She's gone to find Miss Toni.<br> Here they are, now.<br> Tessa!<br> Tessa!<br> -She's fainted.<br> -She's quite pale.<br> Bring her into the house.<br> -You told her.<br> -Yes.<br> What's happened?<br> Told her what?<br> Poor little Tessa.<br> She often does this<br> when she runs too hard.<br> Take her to our bed, Lewis,<br> I know how to take care of her.<br> She's all right, Florence.<br> I can take care of her.<br> All right.<br> They're excitable little things,<br> arent' they? It's just a faint.<br> There's always something silly<br> happening up here!<br> All right you are, father dear.<br> What are you laughing at?<br> When you hear my news<br> you're going to faint.<br> I'll faint if I don't get<br> my breakfast. Robert-o!<br> S, s, signore!<br> Well, what's the joke?<br> The joke will wait till<br> after breakfast.<br> Have you gone barmy, too?<br> Yes, I'm afraid I have, darling.<br> Hello.<br> -She has faint before.<br> -Oh, please, go, Roberto.<br> Poor little Tessa.<br> Go and have your breakfast, Lewis.<br> Why did you run so fast?<br> Don't talk to her, Lewis.<br> Please, go.<br> She's all right now.<br> If you need anything<br> call me.<br> -Isn't that Lady Longborough's mare?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Hello, Charles!<br> Oh, there you are!<br> Hello... hello, Charles.<br> My dear Constance.<br> One can drop off<br> at this slow pace.<br> I've been behind you<br> all over around the park.<br> I couldn't mistake that<br> fat back of yours.<br> -When did you get back to London?<br> -About a week.<br> What's all this about Florence?<br> My girls tell me that...<br> ...she's hidden that beautiful<br> husband of hers away.<br> I can't wait to know<br> what's wrong with him.<br> That's a long story. You're coming<br> tonight, of course.<br> Yes, I called up Florence and<br> accepted at once.<br> I can't wait to see this man,<br> this Mr. Dodd. Who was he?<br> -That's still a matter of conjecture.<br> -Oh, I see.<br> Not a bad looking sort of bloke,<br> bangs away all day on a piano...<br> Nothing wrong, really.<br> It's all quite beyond me but...<br> ...as long as he keeps<br> Florence happy.<br> -She's all I've got left, you know.<br> -Is she happy?<br> It's something new for her,<br> a chap like this.<br> We, Creightons, have always been<br> on the exploring side.<br> Mmm, I remember, that nice<br> sister of yours, Evelyn.<br> That was a sort of<br> musician fellow too, wasn't it?<br> Yes, well, that's too<br> another story.<br> -Well, I see you tonight, right?<br> -All right.<br> -Good-bye.<br> -Good-bye.<br> Take care of yourself.<br> -What's all this about?<br> -Mrs. Dodd's orders, sir.<br> Reception tonight.<br> The second piano, sir.<br> Oh!<br> -Be careful!<br> -Careful!<br> -Where you want it, governor?<br> -I'll let you know.<br> The hat, sir?<br> I'd like to know how you got it<br> into your head that I'm a pianist,<br> -which I'm not.<br> -That's a pose, darling.<br> We're married.<br> Why pose to me?<br> I've heard you play with Carolli, so...<br> ...I have Carolli coming to play<br> the piece with you.<br> The other piano is coming in now.<br> Then let him play alone!<br> Why stick me out there<br> on exhibition?<br> I promised myself you'll play,<br> I promised lots of my friends--<br> I will not be told<br> what I must or must not do!<br> I've never permitted to be bullied<br> and I'm not going to start now.<br> I'm not a child.<br> Aren't you behaving like one?<br> One thing in the world I hate<br> is your class of upper-class.<br> -Pompous, hard-headed, domineering.<br> -Now, you're becoming rude.<br> If you hated my class,<br> why did you--?<br> I know. Why did I marry you?<br> Well,<br> you said that before, and<br> each time you ask...<br> ...I find it more difficult to answer.<br> -You'd not dare say such a thing--<br> I do dare! I have dared,<br> it's the blunt truth.<br> It's most ungallant and cruel of you<br> to say such a thing to my face!<br> You dislike the truth.<br> I'm sorry I haven't got<br> the gift for that...<br> ...mental sleight of hand<br> you people call manners.<br> I won't allow you to say<br> such things to me.<br> Then, stop me, or leave me alone.<br> -Madame...<br> -What?<br> The other piano, madame.<br> Oh, yes. Bring it in here<br> with the other one, will you?<br> Come on, boys.<br> -Good morning, Lewis.<br> -Good morning, Charles.<br> I'm very angry.<br> You're very wet.<br> Nevertheless, I-I--<br> I've never felt less like talking<br> to anyone in my life.<br> You two people are turning<br> this house into a camp room.<br> If this sort of brawling<br> gives you such squack...<br> why don't you go out in the park<br> and shout it out?<br> Was I very noisy?<br> I thought you weren't earnest!<br> And I'm sure the servants<br> and those workmen out,<br> even the policeman on the corner<br> would share my impression.<br> Whenever did you learn<br> to behave like this, Dodd?<br> Where did Florence learn<br> to believe she's a superior being?<br> Florence has no such illusions.<br> Whatever minor differences<br> arise between you...<br> ...you could have the decency<br> to keep it between yourselves.<br> Yes, Charles.<br> I realize that you're<br> a different sort of chap.<br> You have your ideas about things<br> and we have ours.<br> And there you are,<br> it's love's young dream and...<br> ...I can readily see that<br> it could easily go on the rocks.<br> I don't care about you,<br> but Florence, well, naturally...<br> ...she's a great concern to me.<br> And let me tell you, Dodd,<br> I think, well--<br> you seem to take a certain<br> satisfaction on upsetting her.<br> No, no...<br> Look, those people we had<br> to lunch last Thursday,<br> you lunched in the park!<br> And told her you'd rather<br> eat with the birds...<br> ...and share your lunch with them.<br> After all, that is--<br> well, it seems to me, I'm sure<br> that if I cared for a woman--<br> -well, you know what I mean.<br> -My dear Charles,<br> I will not be run by Florence<br> or anyone else.<br> Oh, no, come,<br> come, my dear chap.<br> How is she trying to run you?<br> She wants me to become<br> a concert pianist overnight...<br> -...and perform at the party.<br> -The poor girl's got her heart set on that.<br> -I know.<br> -I dislike this piano business myself.<br> But she's got quite<br> a lot of friends and...<br> ...you've been sort of<br> a mystery chap to them all.<br> -You know Florence.<br> -I wonder.<br> Have you had any doings<br> with horses?<br> -Mm?<br> -Horses.<br> Horses? I'm afraid not.<br> If you'd had, you'd know that<br> a strong light hand works wonders.<br> -Oh, you mean, slap?<br> -With Florence? Oh, dear, no!<br> Not on your life! Then,<br> you would have fireworks!<br> But a light rein,<br> Lewis, my boy.<br> She's got plenty of spirit.<br> You wouldn't have her otherwise.<br> And she's really devoted to you.<br> I know that.<br> You are the first and only one.<br> And she's a woman.<br> And a very charming one.<br> I do see clearly what you mean.<br> It might easily be that<br> I'm the one that's wrong.<br> -We must do something about it.<br> -Ah, good boy.<br> I'm really very sorry<br> about all this.<br> Now, don't you lean over<br> too much the other way.<br> She'll take the bit in her teeth<br> if you give her too much ahead.<br> -I see. Thank you very much, Charles.<br> -Not at all.<br> Hello.<br> Here's your piano.<br> I hope it's in tune.<br> Uh-huh. Very nice.<br> You're nice.<br> Do I always seem<br> to get my own way?<br> I see no reason why<br> you shouldn't.<br> I'm afraid my way is a little<br> on the selfish side sometimes.<br> But in this instance is<br> as much for you as for me.<br> -For me?<br> -I want them to know you, like you.<br> In other words, I want<br> to show you off.<br> I'm really very proud of you.<br> You can't blame me, can you?<br> In that case, I shall play<br> from the heart.<br> Who is that letter from?<br> -Paula.<br> -Oh, Paula?<br> -The girls! Let me see it.<br> -No, it's to me and private.<br> There can't be nothing private<br> about those kids.<br> -It's addressed to me.<br> -It's addressed to both of us.<br> I'm losing my patience with them.<br> -Why?<br> -They're spoiled, both of them.<br> "When Florence wrote that letter<br> to say we must stay,"<br> "our hearts were broken."<br> "It's probable that<br> we shall hang ourselves,"<br> "but Tessa insists that<br> it is a coward's game."<br> "Hanging, I mean."<br> "The girls here are hateful.<br> They say we don't wash."<br> They don't wash...<br> "Because of Tessa's heart,<br> she doesn't have to play hockey."<br> "I do, while she goes off and<br> thinks of so many things."<br> "One thing I know she wonders is..."<br> "...whether you're having a nice time<br> and like being married."<br> Well, they should be the ones<br> to lose their patience.<br> It sounds like a horrid school!<br> They've been there four months!<br> Darling, how can you say that,<br> I was there myself.<br> The girls say it, both of them.<br> They're not liars.<br> Lewis, didn't you yourself<br> want them to go?<br> -Didn't you write to father to come<br> to their aid? -Yes, I know.<br> Didn't I voluntarily constitute<br> myself their guardian?<br> I know you did, darling.<br> -What are we going to do with them now?<br> -Let them stay where they are.<br> There's Tessa with a bad heart...<br> Darling, I'm assured<br> it's not serious.<br> It's called valvular lesion, I went<br> into the matter thoroughly.<br> Valvular what? It sounds ugly.<br> I don't like it.<br> -No, we must take this our way.<br> -And send her where?<br> Wherever she can stay,<br> just as she is.<br> We'll go down to the school<br> and see what it's all about.<br> Darling, I know what it's all about.<br> Tonight we have the party.<br> I'll go down with you tomorrow.<br> -All right, we'll surprise them.<br> -Nothing would surprise those simps.<br> -You always seem to be digging at them.<br> -Do I?<br> Yes.<br> -You should bring this on a tray, Roberto.<br> -S, signora.<br> "Sanger sisters disappeared<br> this morning."<br> "Last seen at about 11:00.<br> Are they with you?"<br> "We'll not inform police<br> until I hear from you."<br> -There! You see?<br> -I do see.<br> I'm going to wash my hands<br> of them, that's all.<br> Fine. While you're washing<br> your hands...<br> ...I'm going to find them.<br> -Where?<br> -Roberto!<br> -S, signore.<br> First, I'll go to the school.<br> Would you be kind enough<br> to phone them there?<br> -And tell them to advise the police.<br> -Lewis...<br> I'm almost afraid to remind you<br> that we have guests tonight.<br> -Guests?<br> -Our party.<br> Oh! Well, if I find them<br> I'll be here.<br> You will not humiliate me by being<br> among those missing, will you?<br> Don't be absurd! I'm certainly<br> going to find those children!<br> The florists ask if you'd like<br> festoons in the drawing room.<br> I don't care.<br> -Hello, Florence.<br> -Hello, Constance.<br> Hello, Alicia.<br> -What on earth are you doing out here?<br> Go along, darling.<br> I'll be there in a moment.<br> You'll catch your death of cold.<br> -Good evening.<br> -Good evening, madame.<br> Ah, there you are, Charles!<br> Hello, Contance. Alicia.<br> How are you, Turtle?<br> Any woman's voice singing<br> gives me a toothache.<br> A nerve I suppose.<br> You should hold whiskey<br> in your mouth, over the tooth.<br> I can't do that. I've been drinking<br> brandy and they don't mix.<br> -Wouldn't brandy do as well, mother?<br> -Yes, I suppose so.<br> Your Florence will have<br> more than a toothache...<br> ...if she doesn't come away<br> from that draughty door.<br> Really? Oh, well...<br> Come on, let's go in.<br> What were you doing at the door?<br> You'll catch your death of cold.<br> It's humiliating. I don't even know<br> where he is.<br> He'll sure follow those wretched children<br> onto the continent.<br> -And never come back, any of them.<br> -Don't say that.<br> Take that look off your face.<br> It's an excellent party.<br> In spite of that dreadful woman<br> warbling her head off.<br> -Good heavens!<br> -What?<br> There's that Fritzie chap.<br> Did you ask him?<br> Lewis wanted them asked. I didn't think<br> they'd come all the way from France.<br> Hello, there.<br> I didn't see you come in.<br> -You were very preoccupied, madame.<br> -At the door, yes.<br> -I'm glad you're here.<br> -Oh, I love parties...<br> ...and Fritz loves moving in<br> higher circles, so we came.<br> I was frightfully sick<br> on the boat.<br> Florence, you're looking<br> awfully worried.<br> The children run away from school<br> and we're in a panic.<br> -Lewis is out searching for them--<br> -Fritz and I thought they would do it.<br> By the way, I'm going to<br> have a baby.<br> Florence, did you hear anything<br> since I telephoned?<br> No.<br> -Hello, Lewis.<br> -Hello, Fritz. Hello, Toni.<br> -Lewis, darling!<br> -Did you find them?<br> -No, I'm worried to death.<br> What did you do?<br> I was going up to Seven Oaks<br> from that school...<br> ...and I knew you wanted me back<br> for this thing.<br> I've got Scotland Yard<br> after them.<br> Darling, hurry and change,<br> Roberto's waiting for you.<br> Oh, yes, I must. You two,<br> come up with me, we can talk.<br> Yes. Careful, darling.<br> Hurry!<br> Roberto! I'm going to have a baby.<br> Un bambino, magnifico, signora.<br> -Hello, Roberto.<br> -Mr. Fritz.<br> Mr. Lewis, they are here.<br> Signorinas Paula and Tessa.<br> -Here?<br> -Yes, they arrived two hours ago.<br> -Did you tell madame?<br> -No, the girls would not have it.<br> They see the people,<br> they're afraid, so...<br> ...they wait in the stables.<br> -Go and get them! Pronto!<br> Ah, that's a load off my mind.<br> -In the stables?<br> Yes, the studio were I work<br> is over the stables.<br> Lewis, Fritz and I've been talking.<br> As I'm going to have a baby<br> I'll need company and--<br> Little Toni is going<br> to have a baby.<br> Lewis, don't embarrass me.<br> Oh, I've got to dress.<br> Paula could come with us<br> to Paris.<br> She'd be very happy with us and<br> she could go on with her dancing.<br> And we could leave Tessa to your<br> tender mercies. -Yes!<br> When is the big performance?<br> -Four weeks, Regents Hall.<br> Come along, Fritz.<br> He must dress.<br> I'll be down!<br> This is Toni and Mr. Bercovy.<br> Lady Longborough.<br> Her husband.<br> Are you hiding a family<br> as well as a husband?<br> Will you excuse me, please?<br> Who are those little girls?<br> -My little sisters.<br> -And the police were after you.<br> -The police? Lewis, you didn't!<br> Of course I did!<br> What was I to do?<br> Tessa, did you know<br> the police were after us?<br> Lewis!<br> -They're back.<br> -So we all heard.<br> Hello, Florence. We do hope<br> we're not in the way.<br> -Of course not. Hello, Tessa.<br> -Good evening, Florence.<br> Lewis--<br> What are you so shy about?<br> I'm not shy.<br> I've come to lay my bones<br> among you.<br> Darling, it's been so long.<br> -Longer than the longest book.<br> -Yes.<br> Come along. You're like a little boy.<br> You're younger than they are.<br> What a beautiful suit.<br> Thank you, darling.<br> -I'm really sorry about all this.<br> -About us coming back?<br> No! Here we go.<br> Now, you kids, behave.<br> Please don't be angry, Florence.<br> We couldn't bear that school<br> a moment longer.<br> Now, why didn't you let us know<br> you were running away?<br> We've been off our heads all day!<br> Haven't we, Florence?<br> I imagined you dead<br> under trains,<br> hanging from trees...<br> I could not bear it!<br> We'll go down now.<br> I'll send you up something to eat.<br> Oh, thank you so much, Florence.<br> We starved.<br> You haven't had anything to eat?<br> -When did you get here?<br> -Hours ago.<br> -Why didn't I know?<br> -Darling, you were having a party.<br> Naturally, they were afraid<br> you'd be upset.<br> -You can see that, right?<br> -Anyone would think I was an ogress.<br> I shall play for you,<br> sweet Florence...<br> -...as I've never played before.<br> -What are you going to play?<br> -The Sanger Symphony.<br> -Oh, Lewis, are you?<br> It's called "Tomorrow",<br> a symphonic poem.<br> Even you will like it.<br> Come along, darling.<br> Can we listen, you think?<br> I shall be most hurt<br> if you don't.<br> -From up there, girls.<br> -Naturally, Florence.<br> Florence, where have you been?<br> Lewis, my boy,<br> I want to introduce you...<br> ...to one of my oldest friends.<br> May I present my son-in-law,<br> Mr. Lewis Dodd. Lady Longborough.<br> -How do you do, Mr. Dodd?<br> -How do you do?<br> At long last.<br> -This is my daughter, Alicia.<br> -How do you do?<br> -Captain Turtle.<br> -How do you do?<br> -Turtle?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> I will buzz along. You know,<br> a little bubbly water.<br> Yes, run along.<br> -Excuse us.<br> -Careful, dear.<br> -Yes, mother.<br> -Is his name really Turtle?<br> -Yes, Turtle.<br> Archie Turtle, yes. Why?<br> I don't know.<br> What's the joke?<br> -It's no joke, Charles.<br> -What's no joke?<br> Captain Turtle!<br> Isn't there a fable about<br> a fox and a turtle?<br> You mean, the hare<br> and the turtle.<br> He has a fine pack of foxhounds,<br> if that's what you mean.<br> Yes, that's exactly<br> what we mean, Charles.<br> You two seem to have clicked.<br> Have you met before?<br> No, no, very unfortunately.<br> Dodd's very well-mannered.<br> He couldn't look less like a musician.<br> You should live in this house and<br> hear him musicianing every morning.<br> My husband used to sing in the bath<br> every morning, regularly.<br> I'm sure he did. He had<br> good cause to be happy.<br> I could beat Florence for<br> hiding you away from me.<br> Florence! Come here!<br> Constance is stealing your husband.<br> To the piano with me, my boy.<br> Mr. Carolli's waiting for you.<br> Besides,<br> you're making too much<br> of a success with women.<br> -If you take him away I shall go.<br> I'm 72 years old,<br> I don't like music.<br> -I have an appointment with a horse.<br> -Tonight?<br> No, early in the morning. Sylvia,<br> my mare, gets fretty if I'm late.<br> Mr. Carolli's getting fretty about<br> your music. Come along.<br> -I'd love a drink.<br> -You can have one later.<br> Please stay.<br> He's going to play now.<br> Yes, I stay. Get me<br> a straight chair.<br> It was very kind of you<br> to come, Mr. Carolli.<br> You know, I'm not a concert pianist.<br> You'll have to do most of it.<br> You have written a mouthful.<br> -A lot of people don't like music.<br> -Quiet, father, please.<br> That wretched woman warbling<br> got them all in.<br> -On your own head be it!<br> -Father...<br> It's a wonder to me<br> any reasonable piano...<br> ...can stand up under<br> such a pounding.<br> Maybe that's why<br> they have two pianos.<br> Quiet, Uncle Charles.<br> -What's the matter with you?<br> -That's not what he said he'd play.<br> The first opening chords were the ones<br> Sanger wrote on that day but--<br> -the main theme is so dissonant.<br> -There's no melodic line.<br> There's no feeling of it,<br> it's just rhythm.<br> It's very modern.<br> It's long way from tears.<br> -What do you mean?<br> Sanger said Lewis would be great<br> if he could only cry or suffer.<br> I suppose this is<br> a form of suffering.<br> Don't joke.<br> Listen to it.<br> I am, and he's forgot<br> his heart again.<br> He did remember it once.<br> Remember?<br> Then Florence came along<br> and he lost it again.<br> And they lived happily everafter.<br> -That's not what I mean.<br> It's his music.<br> Well, what can you do about it?<br> Lewis has gone from us.<br> What else could it ever be now?<br> -Good morning.<br> -Good morning, Miss Tessa.<br> -Nice party last night?<br> -Yes, Miss.<br> -Good morning.<br> -Good morning, Miss.<br> -Good morning, Tessa<br> -Good morning, Florence.<br> -Very nice last night, Thorpe.<br> -Thank you, madam.<br> There'll be six for lunch.<br> Tell the cook to come down.<br> -Good morning, Hamilton.<br> -Good morning, Miss Tessa.<br> -Oh, Florence?<br> -Yes.<br> -It must've been a lovely party.<br> -Yes, it was.<br> I'm really awfully sorry about it.<br> Yes, we must talk about that.<br> At least you got one of us<br> off your hands.<br> I just saw Paula off at the station<br> with Toni and Fritz...<br> ...and she looked very happy.<br> Now I only have<br> one little problem.<br> Speaking of problems,<br> where's Lewis?<br> At work, in the studio.<br> -Oh, thank you.<br> -He's working.<br> Yes, I know.<br> -Good morning, Robert-o!<br> -Good morning, signorina.<br> If you have a bad heart,<br> why you dash upstairs like that?<br> Here I am,<br> the last of the brood.<br> And the pick of the bunch.<br> -Well, I'm glad about one thing.<br> -What's that?<br> You haven't been turned<br> into a lady.<br> I thought that's what<br> you wanted me to become.<br> No! Promise me you won't change.<br> You're perfect as you are.<br> -You think so?<br> -I know so.<br> -Is your concert on the 28th?<br> -Uh-huh, 28th., Regents Hall.<br> -Are you very excited about it?<br> -Not a bit.<br> -I wouldn't blame you.<br> -Why?<br> It's only my opinion.<br> Of what?<br> Of what Sanger's opinion would be<br> if he had come to your nice party.<br> In the first place, it was not<br> my nice party. It was Florence's.<br> It sounded a bit like it.<br> Tessa! Are you being ungracious?<br> Of course not.<br> I only meant that, uh--<br> What?<br> -What? What do you mean?<br> -You know what I mean.<br> You mean this?<br> -Don't stop. It's so exciting.<br> -What's exciting?<br> You really took them by storm<br> last night. They were thrilled.<br> They were amateurs! Ask Tessa<br> what she thinks of it.<br> -Why should I?<br> -She's a musician.<br> What is your opinion, Tessa?<br> Well, it was very loud,<br> and very defiant,<br> and it was very aggressive,<br> and I suppose some people...<br> ...pretend to like it even<br> if they didn't understand it.<br> And did you understand it, Tessa?<br> Thank you, Florence.<br> Unfortunately no and I don't think<br> Lewis did, either.<br> That is, if he's as honest about<br> his work as he always has been.<br> What are you talking about?<br> A symphonic poem entitled "Tomorrow"<br> by Lewis Dodd. Remember?<br> That's what she's talking about.<br> It was very beautiful. Once you had<br> a melodic line you were going to develop it.<br> -And I haven't developed it, I suppose.<br> -No, you haven't.<br> Oh, what's the matter with you,<br> darling Lewis?<br> I don't know, I'm bewildered.<br> You aren't taking her seriously,<br> are you? Why argue with her?<br> Lewis had something very worthwhile.<br> once. Sanger said so...<br> ...and at the time Lewis agreed.<br> Then he must have become<br> ashamed of it and--<br> hid it under a lot of--<br> -A lot of what?<br> Mathematics!<br> Lewis is in deathly terror<br> of sentiment.<br> About his work, I mean,<br> aren't you, Lewis?<br> The melody is here!<br> Oboes.<br> Listen.<br> I did listen last night.<br> Eight miserly little bars<br> and then...<br> ...suddenly, off you go and<br> sound like a railway engine!<br> Bang-a-tee, bang-a-tee, bang!<br> Bang-a-tee, bang-a-tee, bang?<br> What do you mean?<br> Really, Lewis, I wonder<br> you have the patience.<br> Of course I have patience.<br> She's a Sanger.<br> Sanger or not, I hope<br> you won't change it.<br> I must say, all you Sanger people<br> are so talented.<br> It's a wonder to me you don't write<br> something of your own.<br> I wish I could, but, you see, I have<br> no talent or-- vocation for anything.<br> Well, let's change the subject.<br> I've spoken to Miss Batterfield<br> on the phone...<br> ...and she refuses<br> to have you back.<br> So, I decided upon a new school,<br> that is, if they'll have you--<br> No, school for Tessa<br> is out of question.<br> She can't play games and...<br> ...she doesn't like girls<br> and girls don't like her.<br> What are we to do with her?<br> -The first thing is to find out...<br> ...what her instinct tells her<br> about this piece.<br> You wouldn't think of changing it.<br> -Why not, if it's wrong?<br> -Your concert's in four weeks!<br> You don't think I'll perform<br> knowing I had missed.<br> You haven't missed.<br> You're caught up in all this<br> mad Sanger nonsense again.<br> After you worked so steadily<br> and so seriously.<br> Perhaps, too steadily<br> and too seriously.<br> Tessa, will you speak<br> when you're spoken to?<br> Will you please not<br> lose your temper?<br> Oh, I started this. I'm sorry.<br> All right, all right... Err,<br> let's stop all this, Florence.<br> If you don't mind, I--<br> I'd like to think a little.<br> Of course. We'll go for a walk<br> in the park, Tessa...<br> ...and talk about you and<br> what to do. Come along.<br> No, as a matter of fact,<br> I'd like Tessa to stay here...<br> ...and talk about it.<br> Obviously, she remembers<br> the original play.<br> Of course I'll stay, Lewis,<br> if you really want me to.<br> Would that be all right, Florence?<br> Certainly.<br> Lewis, that's it!<br> All right, it'll be<br> four dozens of these.<br> Mrs. Lewis Dodd,<br> Four dozens of these. Mrs. Lewis Dodd,<br> I'll take the large one.<br> Please wrap it up nicely,<br> I'll take it with me-- excuse me...<br> Do you think<br> it's too large for Lewis?<br> No, it's beautiful but<br> I don't think he'll wear it.<br> I think he will.<br> Do you by any chance send<br> bouquets to male composers?<br> I've never heard of it, Miss.<br> -I'm sending flowers to Florence.<br> -What are you sending?<br> -Roses, four dozens.<br> -Oh, Fritzie!<br> Wouldn't it be fun if you sent<br> the flowers to Florence from Lewis?<br> He's never sent her flowers,<br> he's been working so hard.<br> She'd be so pleased!<br> All right, then I'll send<br> some more from Toni and me.<br> Oh, no, that would take<br> all the gloss off the gingerbread.<br> There'd be nothing but roses.<br> Let's just send these from Lewis.<br> All right. And what shall I<br> write on the card?<br> She knows your handwriting.<br> He can write it.<br> The cards, please.<br> Thank you. Uh...<br> ...would you be kind to write<br> in a kind of untidy handwriting...<br> "To dear kind Florence"<br> No, "kind" isn't right, she--<br> It's not enough--<br> What is she?... uh...<br> "To dear, dear,<br> patient Florence..."<br> "To dear, dear, patient Florence,<br> with all my love, Lewis."<br> No, just say:<br> "Love..."<br> "Dear, dear, patient Florence.<br> Your Lewis."<br> Thank you.<br> No, he wouldn't say that. Um...<br> Leave out the "your".<br> Just say "Lewis".<br> "To dear, patient Florence.<br> Lewis."<br> Thank you. Send them over right away<br> You know the address?<br> -Yes, Miss.<br> -Thank you.<br> Come on, Fritzie.<br> -Thank you.<br> -You'll write it very untidily, right?<br> -Yes, Miss.<br> Ooh, look, they're all over London.<br> I'm so excited I can hardly breathe.<br> Would you stand still<br> just a minute? Thank you.<br> I wish Toni and Paula<br> were here to see it all.<br> We'll be over in Spring to stay,<br> after the baby.<br> Isn't Toni excited? It's such fun<br> creating things, isn't it?<br> -Good evening, sir.<br> -Good evening.<br> -Is tea ready?<br> -Yes, Miss.<br> You'll see Lewis if I have<br> to carry you. - I have to go.<br> -I'll take the box.<br> -I carry my dress. Come on.<br> -Hello, my darling Uncle!<br> -Hello.<br> You remember Fritzie, don't you?<br> -How do you do, sir?<br> I have to go to the hotel now--<br> -No, no...<br> Mr. Fritzie, I shall never<br> forget him.<br> How do you do, sir?<br> You look nice and warm<br> and comfy.<br> I have to go back.<br> -You're going to say hello to Lewis.<br> -I have an appointment!<br> You come and pour me<br> a cup of tea.<br> This place is like the Sahara desert.<br> Not a soul in sight and it's after 5:00.<br> All right, I will.<br> Good-bye, sir.<br> -Fritzie...<br> ...you go through there<br> and up those stairs,<br> and don't forget to tell Lewis<br> about the flowers for Florence...<br> ...so he knows.<br> -Oh, yes, the flowers.<br> Ooh, nice!<br> Oh!<br> -What?<br> I got a stitch.<br> It's all right, it's nothing.<br> I'm so excited about tonight.<br> Lewis' name is advertised on<br> all the sandwich boards.<br> Oh, well!<br> -Look.<br> -What is it?<br> It's my dress. Toni sent it,<br> Fritz brought it.<br> I won't look such a child<br> in this, will I?<br> You don't call yourself<br> a child, young woman.<br> Well...<br> It's fresh.<br> If I'm not a child, then,<br> why does your sweet daughter...<br> ...insists on bundling me away<br> to that finishing school in Harrogate?<br> I assure you,<br> if it doesn't finish me, I--<br> shall be here at home<br> on and off until I die.<br> That is, of course,<br> if Florence invites me.<br> Oh, my darling Uncle...<br> Can't I marry you?<br> Then I'll have some place<br> to stay on my holidays.<br> You'd have me whacking<br> at that silly piano all day,<br> just as you're doing with that<br> extraordinary son-in-law of mine.<br> Yes, you're right,<br> he is extraordinary.<br> And very, very tired.<br> -Hello, Florence.<br> -Who's tired?<br> Lewis. He worked until<br> ...and rehearsed till 11:00.<br> -Oh, you have your tea, father.<br> -Yes.<br> -All set for tonight?<br> -Yes, we're going to the Savoy.<br> -Oh, Florence?<br> -Yes?<br> Speaking of the Savoy,<br> I was wondering how you like<br> this dress.<br> -Toni sent it, Fritz brought it.<br> -Fritz?<br> I thought I heard his voice<br> in the studio.<br> If they want their tea, they'd better<br> come now. It's getting late.<br> I sent for Lewis twice.<br> -I'll get him.<br> She'll get him...<br> -She hasn't already?<br> -What are you talking about?<br> You know, I'm not quite such a fool<br> that I don't see what's going on.<br> It's obvious, a blind man<br> could see it. - No, no, no...<br> ...I mean what's going on with you,<br> not with anyone else.<br> You are the one that's heaping<br> coal to fire. And let me tell you...<br> ...if you care about your husband,<br> you'd better pull yourself together.<br> Stop moaning about like<br> a woman in a novel.<br> You have little Tessa<br> on the defensive for him.<br> I heard it just now.<br> I dislike her intensely.<br> Yes, and you made that<br> quite obvious to all and sundry.<br> I saw my sister Evelyn get herself<br> into just such a mess...<br> ...and it killed her.<br> Lewis has been very happy here<br> and so have I...<br> ...until these wretched<br> Sanger children came storming back.<br> They're like a drug to him.<br> There's some language between them<br> that only they can understand.<br> I feel like a stranger<br> in my own house!<br> He said quite casually to me today<br> that he might go away after the concert.<br> What?<br> -Go away.<br> -There you are...<br> ...he's like a weathervane,<br> this fellow.<br> I hardly see him anymore.<br> Lewis is the only man<br> I ever truly cared for...<br> ...or ever will care for.<br> It's some sort of a strange,<br> slow process of defeat.<br> Either very innocent...<br> or very clever.<br> If you don't stop<br> hammering away at it...<br> ...you'll force him to make<br> a bolt for it. You'll see.<br> You don't want them to bolt, do you?<br> That's my nightmare.<br> I'm so afraid of that.<br> -I couldn't stand it.<br> -Poor little Florence.<br> Come on, get your chin up.<br> You always had your own way.<br> You won everything you wanted<br> all along the line.<br> Now, if you have to be<br> a loser, well--<br> Don't worry, I won't lose.<br> I think I'll toddle off.<br> ...advertising your name<br> on the sandwich boards everywhere!<br> My dear sir.<br> I'm just going to get forty winks<br> before the show.<br> It isn't a show and don't you<br> fall asleep tonight, either.<br> Don't you think you<br> ought to get forty winks?<br> My lambkin, I don't even want<br> twenty winks. I'm wide awake.<br> Florence, darling, sorry I'm late.<br> Blame it on Fritzie.<br> So, you are the culprit, Mr. Fritz.<br> How's Toni?<br> She was fine when I left her.<br> I'm going to telephone her now.<br> My dress, Toni sent it.<br> You like it?<br> -Very pretty.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Tea, Mr. Fritz?<br> -No, thank you. I have to go.<br> We'll be seeing you tonight, Fritzie?<br> -Yes, of course.<br> Tea, Lewis?<br> -No, thank you, darling.<br> Later on, I might have a brandy and soda.<br> -Oh, I'll get it for you.<br> He said later!<br> I'm sorry.<br> Well-- I might just as well<br> have it now.<br> Here's Thorpe.<br> Bring the bottle of brandy<br> and some soda, will you, Thorpe?<br> I forgot to tell Lewis<br> about the flowers.<br> You know, I'm very jealous.<br> -Who's been sending you flowers?<br> -Lewis.<br> Come on, let me see the card.<br> -Lewis, I forgot...<br> -What did you forget?<br> -Madame, I can explain, I--<br> -It was really my fault.<br> We were at the florist's and--<br> Oh, Fritzie, you spoiled it all...<br> -What has he spoiled?<br> -Well, Florence, you see, I--<br> I bought some flowers for Lewis<br> to give to you and then,<br> Fritzie forgot to tell Lewis--<br> Yes, of course! I did ask Fritz<br> if he'd be kind enough to--<br> Lewis...<br> Thorpe, please put this flowers<br> in Mr. Dodd's studio. - Yes, madam.<br> Oh, darling, you're not cross,<br> are you?<br> Of course not. Why discuss it?<br> Although I don't think<br> it's important enough to lie about.<br> You know, I'm a thoughtless brute.<br> I should have done something<br> like that on my own.<br> I'm sorry, darling, it's the nature<br> of the beast, I'm afraid.<br> I have no regrets. Anyway,<br> you have Tessa to think for you.<br> Florence, truthfully, it was only an idea<br> I thought and it went wrong.<br> -Well, see you tonight, Fritzie.<br> -Yes...<br> Did Mr. Fritz think of the words<br> "patient Florence"?<br> Oh, darling, you are patient.<br> And you're altogether too nice<br> to be upset, today of all days.<br> -You won't recognize the music, Fritzie.<br> -Has it been changed?<br> Got a little heart in it now.<br> And you're familiar with Lewis' heart.<br> I appreciate it,<br> if that's what you mean.<br> But I suppose I always have.<br> -Good night, Lewis.<br> -Good night. See you tonight.<br> Come take the weight<br> off your feet.<br> What do you think<br> it is with Florence?<br> I don't know.<br> She's quite unaccountable.<br> -What do you think it is?<br> -I don't know!<br> Today I told her I'd go away<br> somewhere alone after the concert.<br> I see, that could easily be it.<br> Was she very angry?<br> No, on the contrary,<br> she was very quiet.<br> I feel sorry for her.<br> But we shouldn't be talking about<br> this private thing, should we?<br> I suddenly feel ashamed.<br> -I felt ashamed for so long.<br> -Don't say that, I don't want to hear.<br> -Then, you know what I mean?<br> -No, I don't want to know.<br> Are you disturbed about me?<br> Of course I am!<br> -Little Tessa...<br> -Such a "little Tessa",<br> such an insignificant<br> nuisance little Tessa.<br> I think I've known it always.<br> And yet, why didn't I know?<br> Lewis, whatever you think you know,<br> you must forget it now.<br> -I love you, Tessa.<br> -No.<br> I know I always have.<br> Once a long time ago,<br> when I kept a diary...<br> -...I wrote something down.<br> -Did you?<br> "One day Lewis will look at me<br> and everything will be all right."<br> And I didn't look.<br> There were other things to see,<br> that was all.<br> Please don't talk about it.<br> It's too late now.<br> No, it isn't.<br> You're coming away with me.<br> -Why did you marry Florence?<br> -I don't know. Now.<br> You couldn't have thought<br> anything about me.<br> Tessa, I always have, really.<br> Then it was unfair to both of us<br> for you to marry her.<br> You were so mad to get her<br> that you forgot all about me!<br> Oh, if only you had waited a bit.<br> It was something I didn't realize.<br> Can you understand that?<br> How can I not understand you?<br> You've been in my mind all the time.<br> You've never really been away from me.<br> I promised myself to you<br> such a long time ago.<br> My darling.<br> No! There's Florence.<br> She's my cousin,<br> I've been living in her house.<br> She's been very kind.<br> Anyway, you belong to her.<br> But if it weren't for that,<br> I'd rather go away with you...<br> ...than anything else in the world.<br> But I can't do this.<br> They'd say we've been carrying on<br> behind Florence's back,<br> I'd be a traitor. I can't.<br> One must do as one thinks right,<br> mustn't one?<br> I said my say.<br> Non giusto.<br> -Oh, Robert-o.<br> Scuzi, signore, but, all the servants<br> go to the concert but me.<br> Poor souls! Well,<br> if you must hear it,<br> there's a wireless radio<br> down in my study,<br> -You can switch it on down there.<br> -Grazie, signore.<br> All right, Robert-o.<br> Florence!<br> Are we going to be late as usual?<br> It's half past.<br> Very beautiful, my dear.<br> Thank you, father.<br> -I don't know about Lewis.<br> -Oh, Lewis, well, uh--<br> -Go along, father.<br> -Well, hurry. That's a good girl.<br> I couldn't face this thing without<br> a bite and a glass of something.<br> -I'll be down.<br> -Well, hurry. That's a good girl.<br> You look lovely, my dear.<br> -No white tie, dear?<br> -No, I'm not conducting tonight.<br> I prefer to wear this.<br> -I see you packed.<br> -Yes.<br> -Take me with you.<br> -Oh, Florence,<br> Don't you think<br> it's much wiser for us--?<br> I'm sorry about this afternoon, but<br> I thought you sent me some flowers.<br> Oh, darling, I can understand so well<br> how you felt.<br> Can you understand how I feel<br> now that you're going away?<br> Lewis, I'd do anything in the world<br> that you ask me to.<br> Go anywhere, be or do<br> anything.<br> Florence, I can't let you<br> say things like these.<br> I mean, you can't put yourself<br> in this position.<br> -After all, that's-- I'm the one--<br> -Oh, I don't care, I mean it.<br> I'm honest, we're married<br> and I love you.<br> If I haven't completely understood you<br> it's not my fault because I've tried.<br> And all the time I had the feeling<br> I was succeeding bit by bit.<br> This is humiliating, really.<br> -For you?<br> -No, of course not. For you!<br> You're attractive and young.<br> You deserve so much more<br> than I can ever be to you.<br> You're giving me up?<br> Oh, please, you can't<br> put it that way.<br> All right.<br> It's you don't want me anymore.<br> Give me another chance.<br> I'm begging you.<br> Look at me.<br> Don't tell me<br> what's in your mind just now.<br> I don't think I could stand it.<br> I'm sure I couldn't.<br> You're going away for a while,<br> I'll wait for you.<br> You might miss me.<br> I hope you will, a little.<br> Will you do me a favor<br> while I'm gone?<br> -Anything.<br> -It's about Tessa.<br> -What is Tessa to do with us?<br> -You were speaking of understanding.<br> If you could just try<br> to understand her.<br> But, what does Tessa matter<br> just now?<br> -Well, I won't be here and...<br> -And what?<br> If I could only be sure that<br> you two are good friends and...<br> -...that you understand her...<br> -Yes.<br> -Don't look like that.<br> -Go on.<br> Well, you know Tessa,<br> she's tender and loyal...<br> ...and she deserves to be loved.<br> Since when have you loved her<br> so deeply?<br> Always, I think.<br> And why did you marry me?<br> I saw no-one but you, then.<br> Have you told her?<br> Does she know?<br> Yes, and she will have none of me.<br> She spoke of you, immediately.<br> That's why I'm asking you to try<br> and understand what she's really like.<br> Don't ask me to try<br> and understand. I do!<br> -You dare suggest--?<br> -I do dare!<br> I told you she'd have nothing to do<br> with me! Ever, because of you!<br> I don't believe it!<br> I've seen enough of them all<br> to know they can't be trusted.<br> And in this house! How could you?<br> What else could it have been?<br> You couldn't even think<br> such a thing about that child.<br> Don't call her a child! It makes it<br> even more contemptible.<br> I put the thought away again and again,<br> because it was so horrible.<br> Because I felt that,<br> no matter what she was,<br> you... you, at least, were decent!<br> I told you to go to the concert.<br> -I was getting the smelling salts, madam.<br> -I don't need them!<br> -They're for Miss Tessa, madam.<br> -Miss Tessa?<br> -She fainted. One of them spells she has.<br> -Where?<br> In her room.<br> I'll take them.<br> Come in.<br> -Hello, Florence.<br> -I thought you were ill.<br> Hamilton said you were.<br> It's just one of those silly<br> dizzy spells. I'm all right, really.<br> Please, don't bother.<br> It's the excitement of tonight and...<br> Yes, the excitement of<br> so many things.<br> You'd better rest here. You could have<br> palpitations during the performance.<br> -No, I won't.<br> -Lie down. I'll call Dr. Tomlin.<br> -Please no, these things pass off.<br> -You'll do as you're told.<br> What's the matter, Florence?<br> You know...<br> I should've never come here.<br> I'm only a nuisance.<br> Don't you think that<br> if I packed my bag and...<br> ...went away with Fritz, stayed with<br> Toni and Paula for a while in Paris...<br> ...got some job and were out of the way,<br> don't you think it would be better?<br> Did you know that Lewis was leaving<br> for the continent after the concert?<br> -Yes, but not to Paris.<br> -You know his plans?<br> Florence, don't have<br> those thoughts, please!<br> -He only said he was going away.<br> -And you promptly have palpitations!<br> Go away.<br> Why did you run away from school?<br> To be near Lewis.<br> Why did you unsettle him<br> about his work?<br> You know what I'm talking about.<br> And you succeeded, didn't you?<br> Didn't you?<br> -With Lewis? Me?<br> -Of course!<br> Oh, you're making<br> a horrible mistake.<br> Such a little girl,<br> so innocent.<br> I'm talking to you now<br> as one woman to another.<br> I'm accusing you directly<br> into your face.<br> You've flung yourself at my husband<br> in this house and you succeeded!<br> I can't help it if I love Lewis! I did<br> long before you came to Switzerland!<br> It's not a happy thing, it brought<br> nothing but sadness into my life.<br> Yet,it's so overwhelming<br> I wouldn't want it to be different.<br> But I have come to understand<br> he is your husband and--<br> I'm not going to see him anymore.<br> That's the reason I want to go away.<br> As for your thinking that<br> we did anything else...<br> ...that's horrible and shocking, and<br> I wouldn't even lower myself to deny it.<br> But I've told you I love Lewis<br> and I can't help it.<br> You talk of love?<br> You don't even know what it means.<br> Yes, I do. I know all about it.<br> -What do you mean by that?<br> -Florence, please!<br> Tessa!<br> Tessa, come along.<br> Tessa.<br> Shouldn't you get going?<br> It's getting late.<br> I do think I'd lie down.<br> Yes, I will.<br> Please, don't be late.<br> I'm all right.<br> -Here are the smelling salts.<br> -Thank you.<br> Come in.<br> -Oh, what a pretty dress.<br> -You think so?<br> -Ready?<br> -No.<br> -What's the matter?<br> -Oh, well, I--<br> -What happened?<br> -I had a few flutterings inside and--<br> Nothing for you to think about.<br> You'd better hurry.<br> -What caused it?<br> -All the excitement of the concert.<br> Have they sent for the doctor?<br> Of course not, I'm used to them.<br> I know all about my valvular "lessons".<br> -What?<br> -My... lesions.<br> They go as quickly<br> as they come.<br> -Sure you're all right now?<br> -Of course, I wouldn't lie to you.<br> Hurry up and finish dressing.<br> I'll tie that up for you.<br> Well, I wonder if I should.<br> Why?<br> These spells behave in the most<br> embarrasing ways sometimes.<br> I wouldn't want to go fluttering<br> in the middle of the performance.<br> They come rather quickly, a sort of<br> humpy feeling here, and then...<br> ...things start to go<br> a little blurred,<br> and then you'd have me<br> slithering on the floor,<br> and considerate old gentlemen would break<br> their poor backs trying to help me up.<br> Then tomorrow the critics would say<br> that you stunt your audience.<br> Or at least, one of them.<br> So, I think I'll stay here<br> quietly and concentrate.<br> I may possibly be going away.<br> I think I'll think about it now.<br> Where would you go?<br> Anywhere, away from our situation.<br> It's getting late.<br> Better be going.<br> No. Our piece is not played<br> until last.<br> "Our piece".<br> Oh, sweet generous Lewis.<br> There's no-one like you in the world.<br> I've always known that, but you haven't.<br> You haven't know yourself at all.<br> -No, until today, I think.<br> -You mustn't.<br> Tessa, you know,<br> I've lived so much longer in this<br> hard world than you have...<br> but you have such wisdom<br> about things.<br> -Have I?<br> -Yes.<br> You said downstairs so truly that<br> ours was an impossible situation.<br> I wonder if you know<br> how many things have made it so.<br> It isn't that I'm married<br> to Florence.<br> It isn't that there are so many years<br> dividing you and me.<br> It's something that has been with me<br> ever since I was a little boy.<br> Hearing strange music<br> in almost anything.<br> -You know?<br> -Yes.<br> Everything, anything that came<br> into my mind...<br> -...was never quite of this earth.<br> -Really?<br> Poor, poor dear Lewis.<br> You never really possessed<br> happiness, have you?<br> I've known nowhere to find it.<br> I never had the power<br> to sense it or take it.<br> I've been very fortunate.<br> I've always had it,<br> as long as I can remember,<br> I've been very fortunate,<br> thanks so much to you. You know,<br> I've never thought of you as<br> either older or younger--<br> Tell me, did you ever suspect and then<br> brushed me off for being a child?<br> No, truthfully, no.<br> Although when I thought you were lost<br> I nearly went out of my mind.<br> No, it was just this evening,<br> downstairs.<br> When I looked at you...<br> ...everything I ever longed for<br> seemed to be there, for me.<br> Really, you must go<br> to your music, now.<br> I'll be thinking of you. Please, go,<br> dear sweet Lewis. Please.<br> I don't want to leave you a bit.<br> -Even if I ask you very nicely?<br> -I'll come back.<br> Aren't you going away?<br> You said you were.<br> I'm coming back.<br> Hurry.<br> Bless you.<br> You always kissed my forehead.<br> Even when I think of you, my forehead<br> pops up to be kissed naturally.<br> Beloved.<br> It's a very beautiful word.<br> You can feel it, but<br> it's so hard to say.<br> What?<br> Beloved.<br> I forgot to give you your flower.<br> I don't know when I'll see you again<br> to give it to you.<br> Because I'm going away.<br> I must.<br> Lewis!<br> Florence is having fits.<br> We gave you up.<br> Come on, boy.<br> Horses are leaving the barnyard.<br> Sorry.<br> Are you a shrinking violet?<br> We thought you deserted us.<br> With all due respect to Beethoven,<br> the thing gave me a headache.<br> Oh, Constance, it was his Fifth.<br> Here's Lewis.<br> Lady Saunders, General.<br> Hello again. This is your place.<br> Oh, no, please.<br> -The place is packed. Where were you?<br> -I walked.<br> He hasn't miss a thing.<br> The whole thing's very loud and harsh.<br> Your hands are like ice. Well,<br> even I'm nervous. Success, Lewis.<br> Oh, I forgot. Good luck!<br> -Good luck.<br> -Same here!<br> Thank you very much.<br> -That's Regents Hall coming through.<br> -Yes. Where do you go?<br> -With Fritz, to Paris.<br> -I'll get you something to eat.<br> All right.<br> -I've been calling you.<br> -Yes, Lewis.<br> You wanted me<br> to call you, didn't you?<br> Yes, I've waited so long<br> to hear you call me.<br> You're not going to school,<br> or anywhere else.<br> Then I'll never be<br> a great lady.<br> -You want to be?<br> -No, no.<br> I want to be growing up<br> like sting weeds.<br> That doesn't sound very nice, Lewis.<br> You want to be with me,<br> always, don't you?<br> Yes, always. Forever and ever.<br> It's the owl of death<br> that frightens me.<br> You must never be afraid.<br> You must be protected.<br> -Protected?<br> -Yes.<br> But my heart is a very simple heart.<br> Isn't that some protection?<br> Yes.<br> May I protect you, or try to?<br> There are so many years<br> between us.<br> But you belong to me,<br> even before I was born.<br> When you were a little boy,<br> you must have longed for me,<br> for me to take care of you.<br> I was on my way to you then.<br> I'm late, but I'm here.<br> I've been waiting for you.<br> Sanger said: "If Lewis could ever<br> suffer... or cry..."<br> Lewis...<br> #When I am dead,#<br> #another love will cheer thee.#<br> #The sun will rise...#<br> #...as bright tomorrow morn.#<br> I'm afraid!<br> The words frighten me!<br> #The birds will sing...#<br> #though I no longer near thee...#<br> #...must lie forlorn,#<br> #lie forlorn.#<br> #When I am in my grave,#<br> #the flowers blowing...#<br> #...shall make thee garlands<br> twenty times as sweet.#<br> #Beauty will live,#<br> #...though I must sleep unknowing...#<br> #...beneath thy feet,#<br> #I must sleep beneath thy feet.#<br> Where's Mr. Dodd?<br> Where is he?<br> -He left.<br> Where's Dodd?<br> -He went before it finished.<br> Did Florence go with him?<br> I didn't see her.<br> She left just after.<br> We'll stop by our house<br> for a nightcap.<br> -Your cab was just driving away. Lewis--<br> -Excuse me.<br> Roberto, where is Miss Tessa?<br> Darling, I must talk to you<br> for a moment.<br> -I can't go on with you hating me.<br> -How can I possibly hate you?<br> How can you not hate me?<br> I've said unkind, wicked things.<br> -I was jealous. Can you understand?<br> -Of course I can understand.<br> I won't stand in your way<br> another moment.<br> And I want to tell her so<br> myself. May I?<br> Why this sudden change?<br> Because I love you and<br> I want you to be happy.<br> This is all my fault, Florence.<br> I'm the guilty one.<br> How can you possibly<br> be guilty?<br> People don't arrange these things.<br> Something else does, I'm sure.<br> I realized that tonight, watching you<br> in the box, hearing at the music.<br> Anyone else would have been--<br> would have--<br> But you've been gentle and<br> very honest.<br> -But that's because you are you.<br> -My dear Florence.<br> Don't think that I haven't been<br> conscious of your quality of--<br> No, I just happen to exist outside<br> your inner world and Tessa's.<br> I understand it very clearly.<br> You must never be sorry for me.<br> We're friends, all of us,<br> aren't we? Always?<br> -Always, yes.<br> -Here they are.<br> Not a servant in the house. Florence<br> sent them all off to that show.<br> Go on with your story, sir.<br> -No, no, Charles, your incorrigible.<br> I never saw the girl again.<br> Girl? She was over 30.<br> -That's right, don't you think, sir?<br> -What?<br> About 30.<br> -She's asleep?<br> -Yes.<br> -Is it her bag?<br> -Yes.<br> -She's going away?<br> -Yes.<br> Did she hear the concert<br> over the radio?<br> Yes.<br> Tessa!<br> Tessa.<br> Little Tessa...<br>
