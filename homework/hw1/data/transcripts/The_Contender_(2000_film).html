                        I bet you've been<br> gettin' a lot of, uh...<br> Churchills, probably Mandela.<br> Some de Gaulles.<br> I'd have to go with, uh...<br> Anwar Sadat.<br> Anwar Sadat?<br> - The former Egyptian president.<br> - Right.<br> No, no. Two years at the paper,<br> I never heard that one.<br> I'd have to say Sadat. Talk about standing<br> up to political and popular pressure.<br> I'd like to think<br> that I had those kind of balls.<br> There's a guy who did not die<br> in vain. He died for peace.<br> Any ideas you'd die for,<br> Governor?<br> Obviously I'd die<br> for this country.<br> - I served, you know, not in Vietnam but Desert Storm.<br> - Right. The Bronze Star.<br> There wasn't a lot of shit<br> to get into there, but I was in it.<br> What I meant was,<br> would you take a bullet...<br> to advance abortion rights, flat taxes,<br> things you've been behind for years?<br> I'd like to think<br> that I'd die for civil rights.<br> Jesus!<br> Jesus Christ! What the...<br> Governor! Governor!<br> Governor Hathaway!<br> Christ! What the...<br> Governor! Governor! Jesus!<br> Yes! No... A car...<br> I'm under a br...<br> Somebody's obviously in the car.<br> The governor is in the water.<br> Yes, Governor Hathaway<br> is in the water.<br> You gotta send<br> somebody out...<br> No, no, I want to see the car<br> come out of the water.<br> - Back it up.<br> - Rewind!<br> - You okay?<br> - I don't know about this, Fiona.<br> Governor, excuse me.<br> Bottom line. You put your ass on the<br> line out there. This guy from the Post...<br> Paul Smith is his name.<br> He's describing what you did as if<br> you should get the Medal of Honor.<br> That isn't the reality, is it? She died.<br> In the end, that's the reality.<br> There's one reality here,<br> Governor.<br> The people have given you<br> Reagan-like approval numbers.<br> - Last week were in the 50s, today you were at 82.<br> - Look at it this way.<br> That girl died.<br> That's a tragedy.<br> But you did everything<br> you could possibly do to save her.<br> They couldn't save the Alamo, either,<br> but everyone who died there's a hero.<br> - We're at a commercial. You're almost up, okay?<br> - Okay.<br> Show your remorse,<br> but don't be broken.<br> You're a national leader now.<br> Think that way.<br> - Is Bert on our side?<br> - Absolutely.<br> - Three, two, one.<br> - This is it.<br> After this,<br> everything will be on our side.<br> He has long been considered<br> at the top of President Evans's list...<br> to fill the vacancy left by the death<br> of the vice president three weeks ago.<br> But after the heroics that have become<br> the stuff of national legend...<br> Governor Hathaway has become<br> the nation's choice...<br> to take on the post of<br> the heir-apparent to the presidency.<br> - Governor, thank you for joining us.<br> - Thank you, Bert.<br> That's a nasty bit of business,<br> what happened on that river. Nasty.<br> It's a damn shame you were<br> the unlucky bastard in that spot.<br> Six and a half years in the White House, press<br> still hasn't gotten wind of these bastards.<br> Yeah, pretty, uh...<br> pretty heroic,<br> what you tried.<br> Just like everybody's<br> been saying, very, uh...<br> - Pure Audie Murphy.<br> - Thank you, sir. I only wish...<br> If it was me, I don't know if<br> I would've dove in there.<br> Might have.<br> But honestly, I don't know.<br> Well...<br> At least for once, the press<br> is turning one of us into a hero.<br> What was it like?<br> It was...<br> It was cold.<br> Oh, sure, this time of year. You were<br> risking your life saving that woman.<br> - The cold alone could've snapped you like a twig.<br> - It was dark under the water.<br> The headlights were on.<br> So were the interior lights.<br> I could see her face.<br> She was very pretty. Young.<br> - She was terrified.<br> - Wow.<br> It was like<br> she was being buried alive.<br> She looked at me.<br> And then she had<br> this look of helplessness.<br> I, I tried to pull<br> at the door, but, uh...<br> I needed air, you know?<br> I couldn't...<br> No. By the time I got back down<br> to the car, she was dead.<br> Her face was frozen in that look.<br> She carried that look of terror...<br> right into her death.<br> You did more<br> than most men would.<br> I wonder.<br> Look, Jack, it's just not gonna happen.<br> I can't nominate you.<br> I can't put you up.<br> We can't have<br> another Chappaquiddick.<br> - I tried to save her. Kennedy ran away, remember?<br> - You failed.<br> Nobody's saying<br> it was your fault, but you failed.<br> It's a bad beef, Jack.<br> You're one of the leaders<br> of this party, a rising star...<br> but you've got<br> a Republican-heavy Judiciary.<br> They're not gonna give<br> a rat's ass about that.<br> They're not gonna care about your years of<br> service or what you've done for education.<br> This would be it.<br> A girl died and...<br> - This administration needs a smooth confirmation.<br> - You let it happen.<br> We had a rocky time<br> over the crime bill.<br> Can't have any more obstacles<br> put in front of us.<br> Well, I appreciate you<br> telling me personally, Mr. President.<br> I'll, uh...<br> I'll support<br> whoever you select, of course.<br> I know that.<br> You're the future<br> of the Democratic Party...<br> and you always will be.<br> Well, there's a boatload<br> of press out there.<br> I don't think<br> you should avoid them.<br> Take it easy, Jack.<br> I don't understand this, Kermit.<br> Six years ago I was the best man for<br> the job, and I'm still the right guy.<br> - I have a great relationship with Runyon...<br> - Listen to me.<br> - Isn't there something we can do about this?<br> - Believe me, I've tried.<br> He's made up his mind. Filling this slot<br> may well be his swan song.<br> Wants to be careful with it.<br> Let's not push it.<br> Why not keep<br> in his good graces?<br> You're a good man, Jack.<br> Want to see the governor out?<br> - Jerry, you want to come in?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Mr. President,<br> Jerry's here.<br> That was as rough as it comes.<br> Never seen anybody look so defeated.<br> - Yeah, poor son of a bitch.<br> - Mr. President?<br> Saw the governor out there. Looks like<br> he had the shit kicked out of him.<br> If I have any more caffeine,<br> I'll be voting for the flat tax.<br> I got this tea<br> from the Greek ambassador.<br> Go on, sit. Never thought of Greece<br> as a tea-producing country...<br> but, Jesus Christ,<br> if this isn't the tea to end all teas.<br> Well, looks like Jack Hathaway's<br> had a shitty week.<br> So Hathaway, he's out?<br> That's solid?<br> That leaves us<br> with Malloy or Hanson.<br> It's gotta be Hanson.<br> Malloy's out.<br> - Now, Mr. President, I think you know...<br> - It's Hanson.<br> You know how I feel. Hanson may have<br> turncoated our way, but a turncoat's a turncoat.<br> We've had a vacancy for three weeks. The<br> nation's moved from mourning to anxiety.<br> I need a vice president. And I need a<br> person who's gonna reflect my politics.<br> - Fill it with Frank Malloy.<br> - No, no. Malloy's got an inflammation of ambition.<br> He won't be doing his job. He'll be preparing<br> to do mine. He's not even my second choice.<br> If it doesn't work with Hanson,<br> we're gonna go back to Hathaway.<br> - Do you think Hanson's a team player?<br> - Senator Hanson is gonna work.<br> And it's the job of you two to make sure<br> that confirmation gets through.<br> - I need to know I can count on you.<br> - Of course you can.<br> The president and I discussed several<br> issues, including the vice presidency.<br> - Did the president offer you the position?<br> - I asked him to withdraw my name.<br> Don't answer it, please.<br> I gotta get it.<br> It's the red line.<br> No, no, no, no.<br> Hanson here.<br> Yeah, of course I'll hold.<br> Shh. Quiet.<br> Hello, sir!<br> I'm great, sir, thank you. Yes.<br> - As a matter of fact, we're watching him<br> on C-SPAN now. - No names were discussed.<br> Yes, she is.<br> One second, sir.<br> It's the president.<br> He wants to talk to you.<br> You wanna speak to him?<br> Hello, sir.<br> This is Senator Hanson speaking.<br> Oh, Christ.<br> That's what the prick said to you?<br> "We can't have another Chappaquiddick. "<br> No, not Evans. Newman said<br> the thing about Chappaquiddick.<br> What the fuck<br> is that supposed to mean?<br> That doesn't even make<br> any sense, Jack.<br> You weren't some drunk<br> who drove your car...<br> off a bridge and abandoned the whore<br> you were fucking to die.<br> That's what I told them.<br> Not in those words.<br> This is the second time<br> they fucked us over.<br> - Did he say who he was going with?<br> - No.<br> - It's gonna be Malloy. Fucking Frank Malloy.<br> - That's what I'm hearing.<br> Jack, he isn't worthy of...<br> - This isn't happening to me.<br> - You can go.<br> You're gonna take it up the ass. Want to<br> bend over and make their job a little easier?<br> You understand<br> what's going on here?<br> This is it.<br> The whole fucking plan, Jack,<br> everything, was to get to this point.<br> We have one shot at this,<br> and it's gone!<br> And you're gonna mope around like some<br> "Frank Malloy,<br> that's what I'm hearing. "<br> - What would you like me to do?<br> - I'd like you to give a shit.<br> I'd like you to call Shelly Runyon back<br> and get this fucking thing fixed!<br> - Why not?<br> - You've already gone over it. It's done, ancient history.<br> I don't feel reconciled<br> about it yet.<br> - I'll think about it.<br> - No, I think it's fine.<br> Okay, I'm not convinced.<br> Thanks.<br> You sure you want to have alcohol on your<br> breath the first time you meet the president?<br> - No, you're right.<br> - No offense. Just wondering.<br> I'm married<br> to the vice president, huh?<br> Whoa, whoa. I haven't been confirmed<br> yet. I haven't even been asked yet.<br> You know what we gotta do pronto?<br> We gotta start working Runyon.<br> - Runyon's gonna be a problem.<br> - Why is Runyon gonna be a problem?<br> - 'Cause he's head of Judiciary.<br> - But the Senate takes care...<br> Everything but the vice president.<br> Twenty-fifth amendment doesn't specify...<br> who runs the show<br> on that confirmation.<br> Rumor has it that the House<br> has advise and consent on this one.<br> - Runyon lobbied just hard enough to get his committee the gig.<br> - Yeah, I think he did.<br> I know his number-two guy, Ted Baker. We<br> went to college together. I'll phone him.<br> - I'll start pummeling him.<br> - No, no, no. Don't say anything to him yet.<br> - Why?<br> - Let's get it on our own merit for now.<br> You know what?<br> I'm not gonna argue with you.<br> Not only are you right, but you're about<br> to meet the president, and you look great.<br> - Doesn't she look great?<br> - Yeah, she looks great.<br> What do you think, Stevenson?<br> I'd go for the number six,<br> slightly right of center, sir.<br> That's what I was thinking.<br> That's what I was thinking.<br> How's your average?<br> - One forty-five last time out, sir.<br> - That's not bad.<br> No!<br> That's what I get<br> for my leftist tendencies.<br> - Senator Hanson and her husband are here.<br> - Bring 'em in.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - I'm gonna need some time with the senator.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Senator!<br> - Mr. President.<br> - You remember my husband.<br> - Will Hanson. The McMahon campaign.<br> We tried to steal your husband away.<br> He runs a hell of a campaign.<br> You gave me nightmare visions<br> of having to return to my law practice.<br> - Hi. Jackson Evans.<br> - Lewis Hollis.<br> - What was the first name?<br> - Hollis.<br> - No, Lewis is my first name.<br> - Lewis. Welcome, Lewis.<br> So, have you guys<br> been down here before?<br> - No.<br> - Johnson, he, uh...<br> built it in '65.<br> Right now some terrorist camp in Libya<br> is being spared a bombing raid...<br> because I'm obsessed<br> with beating my 150 average.<br> - You guys bowl?<br> - Once in a while.<br> What's your average?<br> - Seventy.<br> - I don't have one.<br> Hungry? You want some lunch<br> before we speak?<br> No, thank you, sir.<br> I saw this movie once<br> where the president...<br> is just tickled that anything he wants<br> to eat he can get in a moment's notice.<br> Here. Turns out, it's the perk<br> of the century.<br> - Otto?<br> - Yes, Mr. President?<br> Sorry for the late notice. For lunch,<br> could you arrange coq au vin...<br> with a side of penne?<br> - Spicy or mild?<br> - Spicy.<br> And, uh... Oh...<br> - hazelnut pudding for dessert.<br> - No problem, sir.<br> One day I'll catch him napping.<br> - Anyway, how much did we win that one by?<br> - 61 to 33, sir.<br> It's pretty easy<br> getting over things when you win.<br> I guess Sudan is where the press<br> will make its first hay.<br> I think if we announce, the press<br> might have other things on its mind.<br> But you know, Sheldon Runyon and Jack<br> Hathaway have been friends for years.<br> And Runyon is going to come after me<br> with all guns blazing.<br> Senator, why do we have to worry about Shelly<br> Runyon's guns when I control the atomic bomb?<br> We'll introduce you to the Cabinet in<br> one hour. I'll make the announcement then.<br> - That's fine, Mr. President.<br> - That's the way Jerry Ford did it with Rockefeller.<br> I always thought it was pretty damn<br> classy. Have we notified the networks?<br> Oh, yes. All the pundits<br> are in a guessing feeding frenzy.<br> Box of Malomars says<br> they've already anointed Malloy.<br> - You look great, by the way. Just great.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Okay, guys, one hour,<br> the Cabinet Room.<br> Off to the races!<br> - Senator, is this what you're gonna wear?<br> - She looks fine.<br> - No, she does.<br> - You look beautiful, Senator.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Very becoming.<br> I think it works.<br> Let me explain<br> how this is gonna work.<br> In a minute, POTUS is gonna come in,<br> make an announcement...<br> - introduce you to the vice presidential designate.<br> - Jerry.<br> We hear the president's decision<br> is Malloy. Can you confirm this?<br> In ten seconds you're gonna have<br> your answer. So calm down.<br> All right. Then after he's made...<br> Dave.<br> I'm gonna give you guys<br> So keep them short<br> and, hopefully, sweet.<br> And you can roll starting now.<br> I'll introduce him<br> in five... thousand...<br> four... thousand,<br> three... thousand, two.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> the president of the United States.<br> Welcome. Good afternoon.<br> Please.<br> - Thank you for coming here on such short notice.<br> - Laine Hanson, from Ohio.<br> As I embarked on the task<br> of selecting a vice president...<br> I was driven by the emotion<br> of wanting to make a choice...<br> that would've made Troy Ellard,<br> my friend, proud.<br> Senator Laine Billings Hanson<br> of Ohio is that person.<br> Sherri, you are first.<br> Ms. Hanson, do you feel being a woman played<br> any type of role in the president's decision?<br> Well, I, uh...<br> First I would like to say...<br> what an honor it is to be here<br> before you in this position.<br> And I hope to serve up to the standards which<br> President Evans set for me in that introduction.<br> Thank you so much, sir.<br> To answer your question...<br> - First rate, Mrs. Hanson.<br> - Thank you. I learned a lot from Will.<br> Ah, yes, Will.<br> You, sir, are gonna have<br> to make yourself scarce.<br> - No, of course. I'll give you your privacy.<br> - No, I mean scarce.<br> During the confirmation period,<br> I want you out of sight.<br> - Pardon me?<br> - A wife there behind her husband...<br> is perceived as supportive.<br> A husband following around behind<br> his wife is perceived as a puppeteer.<br> - But I think...<br> - No, honey. I think Mr. Newman's right on.<br> Let Hollis handle<br> the day-to-day...<br> - and I'll be the man behind the curtain.<br> - Where do we go from here?<br> The FBI's gonna have to do<br> an extensive background check.<br> - Director Friend will handle the investigation.<br> - Yes, we made sure of that.<br> Just about every aspect of your life<br> will be uncovered.<br> Your bank accounts,<br> your medical reports.<br> - What am I forgetting?<br> - Correspondence to government agencies, speeches...<br> When Nelson Rockefeller was confirmed,<br> they had over 300 agents working on him.<br> They had a lot more life<br> and cash to investigate, huh?<br> We'll do our own background check in case<br> anything falls through the cracks, to be safe.<br> At the same time,<br> the House will... Come in.<br> The House will put together<br> its bipartisan subcommittee...<br> of the Judiciary to interview you and<br> advise and consent to your nomination.<br> Shelly Runyon's<br> running the show there.<br> Cheyenne, Wyoming, you're on with<br> Vice President Designate Laine Hanson.<br> - Larry, how are you?<br> - I'm fine. Thanks for calling.<br> I just wanted to say<br> to the senator that...<br> all of Cheyenne is with her.<br> We think she's absolutely great for<br> the country and this administration.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - What's the question, sir?<br> I wanted to ask the senator, if she<br> could pick one person from history...<br> to serve as her model for how to behave<br> in office, who would that be?<br> Good question, Senator.<br> Hey, guys.<br> Nice to see you.<br> - Sorry to barge in on you.<br> - No, no, no, no. I'm just watching your girl.<br> - First female prime ministers?<br> - They were great leaders.<br> Would you put Thatcher<br> in that category?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> - You know what? I would have to say Thomas Jefferson.<br> - A man?<br> - She's something, isn't she?<br> - I don't really know her.<br> We served together<br> a few years ago, and, I guess...<br> we just ended up<br> in different company.<br> - Take a seat.<br> - Congressman, the president asked us to come down here.<br> He'd like to let you know he'd appreciate<br> your support in the senator's confirmation.<br> - Really?<br> - He asked me directly, Shell.<br> But the president didn't consider it<br> important enough to ask me personally?<br> You know it's important.<br> It's the old man's swan song.<br> Putting a woman in office<br> means something to him.<br> Laine Hanson's<br> the absolute best choice.<br> You don't believe that.<br> Come on. You're too smart.<br> Look, I don't mind<br> she's a woman...<br> but I'm not confirming a woman<br> just because she's a woman.<br> Laine Hanson<br> has an extra burden.<br> She's has to come on the world stage<br> with perfect credentials.<br> Margaret Thatcher didn't have perfect<br> credentials. The world respected her.<br> The world accepted Margaret Thatcher because<br> they knew she had to answer to Ronald Reagan.<br> A woman better be pretty damn qualified<br> to have nobody to answer to...<br> and Laine Hanson<br> is not that.<br> Look me in the eyes<br> and tell me...<br> that Laine Hanson is your first choice<br> for the vice presidency.<br> Laine Hanson<br> is my absolute first choice.<br> I'd so want you<br> in my poker game.<br> Country needs<br> a smooth confirmation.<br> The president needs<br> a smooth confirmation.<br> The country needs<br> a competent vice president.<br> Excuse me a minute.<br> There's only one person in the world<br> that has that phone number.<br> So who's the second choice?<br> We haven't really settled<br> on anybody yet.<br> Tell me, if Laine Hanson were<br> to be hit by a flying car...<br> who would the president<br> then select?<br> I think the president<br> still likes Jack Hathaway, Congressman.<br> You know...<br> Jack Hathaway, there's a good man...<br> for a Democrat.<br> There's a man<br> I would say would have...<br> a smooth confirmation.<br> - Jack Hathaway?<br> - Smooth as a baby's ass.<br> - He's already taken himself out of it, so...<br> - Right.<br> Right!<br> Well, who the hell knows?<br> Perhaps Lainey<br> will shock the world...<br> by pulling out<br> her brilliance...<br> and erudition at the hearings<br> that none of us know she has.<br> So, Shelly, can we ask<br> for basic fairness?<br> - Fifty-fifty, Democrat and Republican<br> at the hearings? - Of course you can.<br> Congressman! Congressman!<br> Mr. Runyon.<br> Just wanted to steal you<br> for a second. I'm Reg Webster.<br> - Oh, you're one of Stoney's boys?<br> - Uh, no.<br> You staff or intern?<br> Actually I'm a representative.<br> Reginald Webster of Delaware.<br> Oh, fuck me. I'm sorry, Webster.<br> What can I do for you?<br> - I'm running late.<br> - I was hoping I could grab your attention for a second.<br> - What's the skinny?<br> - Well, uh...<br> - I'm late, Mr. Webster.<br> - I understand a chair's opened up in the committee...<br> and I'd like<br> to put my name forward.<br> I believe you'll find me<br> industrious and hardworking.<br> The Judiciarys<br> for senior members.<br> Wheeling was in for five terms<br> before we let him in.<br> My hands are tied.<br> There's nothing I can do.<br> Shelly, I've been trying<br> to reach you for five days.<br> - I left you 32 messages.<br> - Well, leave me a 33rd.<br> - Where you from?<br> - Delaware.<br> Oh, yeah, you were...<br> You knocked Emory Bettis out.<br> Emory used to be<br> in the Thursday night game.<br> He was always good<br> for a few hundred bucks.<br> I guess he ran his campaign<br> like he played poker.<br> I take it you have<br> a predisposition.<br> - About the confirmation, I mean.<br> - No. Actually, I'm 100% objective.<br> - Mmm. Do you have a dictionary, Mr. Webster?<br> - Yeah.<br> Take a Magic Marker,<br> cross out the word "objectivity. "<br> Your constituents want you<br> for your opinions, your philosophy...<br> for your subjectivity.<br> Laver has to duck<br> out of the way of that one.<br> One that Laver can't get.<br> He's still trying to recover.<br> And he zings another<br> powerful forehand past Laver.<br> See that, Tim-Tim?<br> Know what we call that?<br> - We call that topspin. You know<br> how we get topspin? - Uh-huh.<br> - Yeah? Tell me.<br> - 'Cause Baby Jesus made topspin.<br> What?<br> - Baby Jesus gave it topspin.<br> - Jesus?<br> Ah! Why do you say that?<br> - Because Baby Jesus made everything.<br> - Yeah? Who told you that?<br> Miss Moyer in kindergarten,<br> and Mommy says...<br> - I have to listen Miss Moyer.<br> - Wow, this is news to me.<br> I gave up my career trying to strike that<br> nonsense out of the public school system.<br> Maybe I ought to put him<br> in public school, then.<br> Remember what I told you<br> about moving your grip down...<br> - and to the left?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Go see if Dad's found his bathing suit yet.<br> - Gimme a hug.<br> Yeah. Thanks, champ.<br> - They are paid to teach, not...<br> - To preach.<br> I know, but he's six years old, and he<br> also believes in the tooth fairy...<br> - and that George Washington never told a lie.<br> - Well, it drives me crazy.<br> - Mary, wanna turn the ball machine off?<br> - Yes, Mr. Governor.<br> Thanks for seeing me, Dad.<br> - Why wouldn't I see you?<br> - Partisanship.<br> I gotta love<br> at least one Democrat.<br> You know, Dad, I'm getting some reports<br> that you might not be ready to back me.<br> That you're opposed<br> to my confirmation...<br> - You've heard quotes?<br> - No, I haven't heard.<br> Just that we should expect<br> to be reading of your opposition.<br> Pardon my Swahili, but you're being led<br> a line of pure bullshit.<br> - I haven't said a word.<br> - Maybe it's just that. Maybe you've been quiet.<br> - I hate the press.<br> - I know, Dad.<br> - When I left the mansion, I swore I would never talk to them.<br> - I remember.<br> - I suppose you're gonna force my hand on this, huh?<br> - You wouldn't have to say much.<br> - Just a little something.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> I, uh...<br> I'll call back<br> Joe Glynn at the Times.<br> He's okay.<br> He'll write it up well.<br> I once leaked him some shit about<br> Buchanan. Damn near won him the Pulitzer.<br> - Thanks, Dad.<br> - Sure.<br> Thanks.<br> What would you do,<br> or have done, in my case?<br> Well, when your president<br> asks you to jump...<br> it's hard not to jump,<br> that's for sure.<br> But you remember what Ben Franklin<br> said about the vice presidency.<br> What did he say?<br> I didn't talk to him this week.<br> He said he ought to be addressed as<br> "Your Superfluous Excellency. "<br> In the past ten years, I've enjoyed the kind<br> of power the vice presidency can't offer.<br> Why would anybody want<br> to give that up? Am I crazy?<br> Baby, power is<br> where power goes.<br> - Think you can beat me?<br> - Uh, yeah. Okay.<br> Hey, Tony!<br> Foul!<br> Can't trust<br> those fuckin' people.<br> Speaking of which, Mr. Webster,<br> it turns out you're a Democrat.<br> I, uh, wasn't keeping it<br> a secret.<br> Sad to say, I don't think I can<br> bring you aboard the committee, son.<br> Ray Spies makes all the decisions<br> regarding the other party.<br> - It's a courtesy.<br> - But not a requirement.<br> - It's not, that's true.<br> - If Ray Spies interviewed me...<br> he'd refuse to put me<br> on the committee even for a minute...<br> because he'd find out that<br> when it comes to Laine Hanson...<br> I went to my dictionary<br> and crossed off the word "objectivity. "<br> Are you suggesting Mrs. Hanson may not<br> be your first choice for vice president?<br> I'm suggesting that Laine Hanson has stricken<br> our party with policies and attitudes...<br> that are best served<br> across the aisle from where she came.<br> I take it, like most<br> members of your party...<br> your selection would be<br> Governor Hathaway.<br> Governor Hathaway's a great man.<br> He's a visionary,<br> a bona fide hero.<br> - But he withdrew his name from consideration.<br> - Minds can be changed.<br> - How much discretion can I count on from you?<br> - A hundred percent, sir.<br> - Even from your own leadership?<br> - I said a hundred percent.<br> Good. Good man.<br> Good man.<br> I think if I make the rounds,<br> do the Sunday morning talk shows...<br> raise the level of the game a bit,<br> outtalk her on the issues...<br> Issues? What kind of fucking campaigns<br> are they running in Virginia?<br> Not the kind I'm used to. Jack, this<br> whole thing with the girl drowning...<br> It's bullshit!<br> - I was there, Shelly. The president told me himself.<br> - It's an excuse.<br> Jackson Evans has chosen to make<br> putting a woman in office his swan song.<br> Laine Hanson is the only<br> reasonable choice in your party.<br> He's not going with Boxer.<br> She's too liberal.<br> He's not going with Jones<br> because she's older than he is.<br> - There's Winslet.<br> - She's not coming off the Supreme Court.<br> Laine Hanson is attractive.<br> She's a looker.<br> The mere fact that she was a Republican<br> means that she can't be too far to the left.<br> It's a perfect pedigree.<br> We can't get you in by convincing him<br> you're the right man for the job.<br> We have to convince him that<br> she's wrong. Once we do that, you're in.<br> And Toliver,<br> he's as much as told me...<br> I'm not going for a low blow.<br> It's not my way.<br> You won't have to.<br> We have to go after her. We have<br> to make her wade in her own blood.<br> - Who did you say you were?<br> - I'm Makerowitz.<br> - Makerowitz.<br> - I'm sorry. That doesn't mean much to me.<br> - Web got somebody...<br> - A friend of the Hathaway campaign.<br> Who is footing the not-too-unimpressive<br> bill of Mr. Makerowitz.<br> Private citizen wants to do<br> their own investigation...<br> What exactly are you trying to find out?<br> Campaign irregularities, bribes?<br> - Isn't that the FBI's responsibility?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> But the FBI would not find anything. All<br> of her money is tied up in blind trusts.<br> The kind of improprieties you're talking<br> about, I think that only helps her.<br> Personally, I think the nation would be relieved<br> to know that just because she's a woman...<br> - it doesn't mean she can't be as ruthless as the rest of us.<br> - Governor?<br> You ever stabbed a man<br> in the navel? You?<br> Me? No, I haven't.<br> Stab a man in the navel,<br> and that's all she wrote.<br> Bleeding is so swift and severe, it wouldn't<br> matter if Jesus put His healing hand on the wound...<br> the bastard is dead.<br> We have to gut the bitch<br> in the belly.<br> We all have to understand,<br> we're going to obliterate her life...<br> but it will get you<br> the vice presidency.<br> - Hey, Dog!<br> - Lewis, how you doin'?<br> Wow, that's a plate of food!<br> You didn't have<br> to dress up for me.<br> I had to accompany the senator<br> to the Gridiron Lunch.<br> If John Q. Public could see the money that<br> the knuckleheads that run this country...<br> spend on these lunches,<br> there would be a second revolution.<br> I'm telling you, there is some money<br> spent on these stupid lunches.<br> - What is this?<br> - It's the reason you're here.<br> You can't let anybody know<br> where you got this from.<br> If Runyon found out<br> I gave this to you...<br> he'd fire me,<br> and I don't want him as an enemy.<br> That's Lainey Hanson<br> getting gang-banged.<br> Looks like something<br> out of Hustler.<br> That's her for sure.<br> I know it's hard to tell with her...<br> her face in someone's crotch...<br> but that's her, man.<br> Why are you showing me this?<br> I will not be party<br> to an ambush.<br> Why are you<br> showing me this, Ted?<br> Okay.<br> I want out of Runyon's office. And I<br> thought maybe you could get me on staff...<br> This is the best you could<br> come up with? This shit?<br> This is shit.<br> Read the deposition<br> of the LaVamere lady.<br> She was putting on a sex show.<br> - How long did this go on for?<br> - It was hours.<br> - How many hours?<br> - Three or four.<br> Which one? Three or four?<br> Three, I guess.<br> In her defense,<br> she was drunk.<br> To be honest, once she finished fucking<br> and sucking those two assholes...<br> she was carried into another room, and<br> boys were going in and out of there...<br> but I don't know<br> if she was fucking them.<br> When she came out,<br> she was covered in cum. It was awful.<br> Excuse me, Counselor.<br> I, um...<br> - May I?<br> - Of course.<br> Just to clarify, why exactly<br> was Mrs. Laine Hanson...<br> Strike that.<br> Laine Billings involved in this, uh...<br> appalling and disgusting behavior?<br> - That's... That's what's important.<br> - Exactly.<br> Thank you.<br> It's great to see you guys.<br> There you go.<br> Thank you so much<br> for your support. Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey, Madam Senator.<br> - How you doing?<br> - I'm okay.<br> I wish you'd heard the speech.<br> That line you gave me about...<br> "If we can put a man on the moon, then<br> why can't we put all men on the moon?"<br> It was perfect.<br> It really broke the ice.<br> - Great audience for that, huh?<br> - Yeah, it was great.<br> What's goin' on?<br> Uh...<br> well, it looks like Runyon<br> or somebody close to him...<br> has been running<br> a little private investigation...<br> looking for stuff that the Feds<br> wouldn't even touch.<br> - It's, um...<br> - Yeah?<br> What is it?<br> What...<br> - He doesn't know anything about it.<br> - You're asking me to step down?<br> I'm asking you to do what's in<br> the best interest of the party...<br> and this president.<br> Well, I'm sorry.<br> I can't do it, not over this.<br> He's not going to allow me<br> or himself...<br> to get shot down over what would've<br> been a private sexual encounter.<br> - Some swan song for the old man, huh?<br> - It's fuckin' awful.<br> The senator got a little wild<br> when she was 19. What is the big deal?<br> Let me explain<br> the big deal to you.<br> The people of this nation<br> can stomach quite a bit.<br> But one thing they can't stomach is the image<br> of a vice president with a mouthful of cock.<br> You don't have to use... Look.<br> Let's use the word "alleged. "<br> They got photos! They got witnesses!<br> They got the "alleged" slut...<br> Hey! Let me tell you something.<br> I'm her husband first.<br> I don't tolerate talk like that.<br> - Will, calm down.<br> - You better get used to it, Will.<br> Especially when not even your wife<br> will defend herself.<br> Give me something, Laine.<br> Anything.<br> Hell, just deny it.<br> Why don't you just deny it?<br> It is simply<br> beneath my dignity.<br> Dignity! Right.<br> We'll just have to make this all<br> not worthwhile for Mr. Runyon.<br> What have you got on the<br> distinguished gentleman from Illinois?<br> Some pretty good stuff.<br> - S.E.C. Investigation, 1985.<br> - You got stocks?<br> I want something embarrassing!<br> Something sexual!<br> Little boys, midgets,<br> that sort of thing.<br> - Cows! I don't give a goddamn!<br> - Come on, Kermit.<br> If we do that,<br> we're no better than he is.<br> We are no better than he is.<br> There's nothing there.<br> He got married when he was 21.<br> There's no evidence<br> he ever cheated on his wife.<br> Too bad we're not running in France.<br> We could really nail him on that one.<br> When do you have<br> your lunch with him?<br> With Shelly Runyon?<br> I'm not having lunch with him.<br> Friday, 1:00.<br> It's scheduled tomorrow.<br> It's automatic.<br> He's committee chairman.<br> It was set up. S.O.P.<br> - Laine.<br> - Shelly.<br> I'm sorry I started.<br> You were late.<br> - I'm not too late, I hope.<br> - A minute or two.<br> - Were you tied up with anything?<br> - No, sorry. I'm just late.<br> - Hi, Clem. You too.<br> - Senator, nice to see you.<br> - I ordered you the porterhouse.<br> - No, I don't eat meat.<br> - I'll have the penne.<br> - You should really... Mmm.<br> - Try the steak. Ask Hugo to burn it on the outside.<br> - No, thank you.<br> I really don't eat meat.<br> I'll just go ahead with the penne.<br> - Spicy?<br> - Yes, please. Thanks.<br> So, how are...<br> Will and the boy?<br> Let's forego<br> the small talk today, Shelly.<br> - It'll make me feel cheap.<br> - Let the big talk begin.<br> Have you seen this?<br> That's my... That's my file<br> on you, Senator.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - How did you get it?<br> Have you read it yet?<br> How did you get it?<br> Have you read it?<br> - What do you have to say for yourself?<br> - With all due respect...<br> um, Senator...<br> - it doesn't matter what I have to say for myself.<br> - Oh, it doesn't?<br> It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, all you can<br> claim about me... claim, is that I had sex...<br> - Deviant sex.<br> - Who says it was deviant?<br> I do.<br> And what I say, the people will believe.<br> And you know why?<br> Because I'll have a very big microphone<br> in front of me.<br> Wow, you must<br> really hate me, Shelly.<br> I don't hate you.<br> It's not possible to hate you. You're...<br> What the hell was it that Reynolds<br> called you the other day?<br> Groovy.<br> You're a groovy chick.<br> No, what I, um, do detest<br> is your selfishness.<br> I have served this nation without regard<br> for personal income for over ten years.<br> You are selfish because you want to take<br> on a job that positions you to assume...<br> a mantle of gigantic<br> responsibility...<br> and you do it full well<br> with the knowledge...<br> Of what?<br> What?<br> Greatness is<br> the orphan of urgency, Laine.<br> Greatness only emerges<br> when we need it most...<br> in times of war<br> or calamity.<br> I can't ask somebody<br> to be a Kennedy or a Lincoln.<br> They were men<br> created by their times.<br> What I can ask for<br> is the promise of greatness.<br> And that, Madam Senator...<br> you don't have.<br> Well, then...<br> I just wouldn't be using sex<br> as leverage...<br> if I were you, Sheldon.<br> Because there's one thing<br> you don't want.<br> It's a woman with her finger<br> on the button who isn't getting laid.<br> Will that be the argument the senator<br> offers up before the committee?<br> Sir? Can I get you<br> something to drink?<br> - Uh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.<br> - You sure?<br> No, great.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> - Ah, Mr. Webster.<br> - Mr. President.<br> - Good to see you.<br> - It's an honor, sir.<br> - I've been meaning to have you up here for some time.<br> - Really?<br> Excuse me. Willie?<br> Thank you, Willie.<br> Yeah, you betcha. You unseated<br> that old bastard Bettis.<br> He must've voted against me<br> You know what this is?<br> That's a shark steak sandwich.<br> Fucking shark steak.<br> - You want half?<br> - Uh, no, thank you.<br> - Are you a vegan? Had lunch?<br> - No. Uh...<br> So you choose not to break bread with<br> the president of the United States?<br> Thank you.<br> When I was in the Senate, Bettis could always be<br> counted to leave half a grand at the poker table.<br> Always stayed in, never folded.<br> Always wanted that miracle card.<br> - That's good, isn't it?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Now, Truman,<br> he was a poker player.<br> Damn fine one,<br> as I understand it.<br> Son, I understand you may be<br> making a mess of our plans...<br> to put Laine Hanson<br> into the vice president mansion.<br> Right now, sir, I cannot see<br> supporting Laine Hanson.<br> - How old are you?<br> - Me, I'm 28.<br> And at that age and experience, you think<br> you're the one to sit and judge Mrs. Hanson?<br> Well, that's the whole point,<br> isn't it?<br> I am, sir.<br> Mr. Webster,<br> I'm asking you to lay off...<br> as a personal favor.<br> It's one thing to break ranks<br> and vote against my candidate...<br> but to actively attack her<br> from the bench, that's another.<br> Mr. President, I just don't believe<br> in Laine Hanson...<br> especially when we have<br> at our disposal Governor Hathaway.<br> He's a party loyalist<br> and genuine hero.<br> And I cannot and shall not vote for a<br> candidate simply because she's a woman.<br> I am nothing if I do not<br> follow my heart, sir.<br> I envy you.<br> I do. You know why?<br> Because someday, years from now, you're<br> gonna come in here with your family...<br> and you're gonna look up<br> at my painting...<br> and you'll be able to say to them,<br> your kids and grandkids...<br> "Way back then<br> I defied my president.<br> It cost me my reelection,<br> kept me out of politics forever.<br> I was on the track<br> to maybe one day end up here...<br> destined to make the kind of changes<br> in this country...<br> that only great men, given the right<br> time and place, can make...<br> and I have none of that now,<br> but that's okay...<br> because I did<br> what was in my heart. "<br> The heart, it can never be wrong,<br> can it, Mr. Webster?<br> Mmm. Delicious.<br> You got a little...<br> Hi.<br> I'm Jack Hathaway.<br> How are you?<br> Hi, sir. Um...<br> Ow. I'm Special Agent Willomina.<br> Sure is good of you to meet me.<br> It's a pleasure.<br> How can I help you?<br> I know you're busy, so this<br> will be as routine as it gets.<br> - Did my girl offer you coffee or something to drink?<br> - Oh, yes, she did.<br> She was very nice, your girl.<br> Yes, she is.<br> She's very nice.<br> So like I said, I just want to cross<br> a couple of T's, little stuff.<br> It's all just part<br> of the process.<br> By the way, sir, I was real impressed<br> with your graciousness...<br> - on the whole Senator Hanson thing.<br> - Oh?<br> You know, in supporting her.<br> Real gracious.<br> Well, as you know, I withdrew my name<br> from consideration.<br> Right. Right.<br> And I think she's a real fine choice.<br> Anybody that knows her knows that.<br> How long have you known her?<br> - Oh, well, actually, I don't really...<br> - I'm sorry.<br> When you said,<br> "Anybody that knows her"...<br> - I know people who know her.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - I'm happy to give you their names, if you'd like.<br> - Great.<br> I don't really know her, but I've<br> seen her several times at functions...<br> and, uh, I think<br> she'll do a real good job.<br> Sir, can I just say that...<br> I was really hoping<br> you'd go for the position...<br> especially after what happened<br> on the Apachaway.<br> I think people would think,<br> in the back of their minds...<br> "This here's a guy who takes risks<br> when the right thing's at stake. "<br> - Lifesaver?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Anyway, some real bad luck,<br> your being right there.<br> Not if I'd been able<br> to save her.<br> No, no, in the crabbing area.<br> It's just that<br> you were fishing for bass, so...<br> That probably explains why<br> we didn't catch anything.<br> You fish in the Apachaway a lot, so I<br> thought that you would know that, but...<br> I don't fish a lot.<br> - I thought your equipment was pretty sophisticated, but...<br> - There's a difference...<br> between wanting to fish<br> and having time to fish.<br> Tell me about it.<br> - And he freed the slaves and won the Civil War.<br> - That's right!<br> He was probably<br> our greatest president.<br> - Even greater than George Washington?<br> - It's a running debate.<br> - Laine Hanson.<br> - Oh, Mr. President.<br> And you must be<br> one Timothy Hanson.<br> Timothy Muskie Hanson.<br> Well, Timothy Muskie Hanson, how would<br> you like a great big cookie? Any kind.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Any kind at all.<br> Oatmeal, white chocolate...<br> Actually, we just had dinner,<br> but thanks.<br> In that case, shall we have<br> our picture taken, young man? Hmm?<br> - How do I look?<br> - Your tie's a little crooked.<br> Well, can't take a picture like that.<br> Will you straighten it for me?<br> Your mommy tells me you know more about<br> the presidents than most grown-ups.<br> - I like to study them.<br> - Mmm! Me too.<br> I think we're ready<br> for business, Dennis.<br> - Sir.<br> - You must be very proud of your mom.<br> Yeah, being the vice president<br> is better than being the president.<br> Oh, I'm sure you're right.<br> 'Cause nobody wants to shoot<br> the vice president.<br> So, you must be feeling<br> pretty excited about now. Please sit.<br> - Hmm?<br> - Well, I think I'm a little nervous.<br> Well, good! Good.<br> Night before a confirmation hearing.<br> Anything else,<br> I would've withdrawn your name.<br> - What about this Webster, sir?<br> - Ah, one second. Anybody here hungry?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - No, sir, I'm not. Thanks.<br> Otto, could you whip up some<br> Kung Pao chicken, but with walnuts?<br> No problem, sir.<br> Ah, the kid. Met him. You know<br> this young congressman, Webster?<br> No, sir, I don't.<br> No matter. He reminds me of me<br> when I was his age. That's bad.<br> K, you need to put out word<br> that no matter what this kid does...<br> nobody's to give him<br> a hard time.<br> He's misguided, but he's got something.<br> And one day, who knows?<br> All right, sir. I'm sure the senator<br> can handle Mr. Webster.<br> There is one concern<br> we need to...<br> Oh, right, concern. Laine?<br> K told me about your little<br> sexual romp in college.<br> Shit. Tomorrow is the 17th.<br> - Glenda?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Tomorrow is Jacobson's birthday. Have<br> you got something for the son of a bitch?<br> Yes, sir. You got him<br> a leather-bound Don Quixote.<br> Oh, good. Good gift.<br> Metaphorical gift.<br> He'll be trying to figure out<br> why I got him that forever.<br> Ah, were you married<br> at the time?<br> Uh, I was a freshman in...<br> You know, sir, I'm just not going<br> to comment on the whole thing.<br> It's beneath me<br> and it's beneath the press.<br> That's the way to go. Fuck the press.<br> Senator Hanson does not kiss and tell.<br> - It's perfect.<br> - Maybe I was too rough on Shelly in Hartford.<br> Then this would all be moot,<br> 'cause you wouldn't be president, sir.<br> You know what?<br> Married, unmarried, One guy, two guys,<br> the whole football team.<br> Who the fuck cares?<br> You just look those bastards<br> in the eye and tell them exactly that.<br> These guys,<br> they're gonna confirm you.<br> But they want to embarrass you<br> in the process.<br> They want to send you into<br> this administration as a virus.<br> So you have only one choice.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - Don't... be embarrassed.<br> Two hours, gentlemen.<br> It is now up to us<br> to light the spark...<br> which will result in a moral uprising,<br> so that we may have...<br> a new birth<br> of national honesty...<br> and decency.<br> And sometimes in this process...<br> you will question<br> even yourselves.<br> And that's good,<br> that's healthy.<br> For what are we<br> if we are not what we believe?<br> Laine Hanson...<br> is a cancer.<br> A cancer of liberalism.<br> A cancer of disloyalty.<br> Her nomination itself is the cancer<br> of affirmative action.<br> What we will sing<br> with voices stentorian...<br> is that she is the cancer<br> of virtuous decay.<br> Clausewitz said that war<br> is the natural extension of politics.<br> But politics is also<br> the extension of war.<br> They are one and the same.<br> In this war,<br> there will be casualties.<br> But so help me God...<br> not among us.<br> Senator, could we have a word?<br> The president canceled<br> his golf game with me.<br> - He always cancels his golf game. Don't worry about it.<br> - Not with me.<br> - Kermit, can I talk to you a second?<br> - We'll talk later.<br> They're home,<br> they're watching, they're proud.<br> Lewis, this is it. Thank you.<br> Order. Order.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Sheldon<br> B. Runyon from the great state of Illinois.<br> It is my privilege<br> and my honor...<br> to serve as the chairman<br> of these special hearings.<br> We are here today for only<br> the third time in our history...<br> to ensure the proper implementation<br> of the 25th amendment...<br> and for the first time...<br> the House has taken on<br> that responsibility.<br> Myself and my esteemed<br> colleagues are determined...<br> to ensure that this very<br> important matter be handled with...<br> expedition and dignity.<br> We are proud to welcome<br> our friend and colleague, Laine Hanson.<br> Madam Senator,<br> I welcome you.<br> Thank you, Mr...<br> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<br> Will the "gentlelady" from Ohio<br> please rise and raise your right hand?<br> Madam Senator,<br> do you swear to tell the truth...<br> the whole truth and nothing<br> but the truth, so help you God?<br> - I do.<br> - Please be seated.<br> Mr. Chairman, point of order.<br> The Chair recognizes<br> Mr. Webster of Delaware.<br> Mr. Chairman, I direct<br> your attention to page 16...<br> tab C-25 of the ledger,<br> a transcript of the Q-and-A session...<br> between the nominee and several students<br> from Harvard University.<br> - Page 16?<br> - Page 16 at the bottom of the page.<br> You'll see the following remarks<br> in reference to a question...<br> regarding the separation<br> of church and state.<br> The nominee said, and I quote,<br> "The separation exists...<br> because we cannot have a fairy tale<br> govern a nation. "<br> What, sir, is the point?<br> The senator just swore an oath<br> to an entity she does not believe in.<br> Madam Senator,<br> you understand...<br> that you have promised<br> to be truthful to this committee?<br> - And that lying to this body is perjury, punishable by law?<br> - Yes, I do understand that.<br> Well, I think<br> we're all agreed...<br> that even though the senator<br> has shown a disdain...<br> for religion<br> and those practicing it...<br> which is her constitutional right...<br> that does not necessarily,<br> Mr. Webster, make her a liar.<br> I'm confident we can proceed.<br> - Madam?<br> - Yes?<br> For the record, would you<br> state your name and address?<br> Yes. My name is Laine Hanson.<br> My address is...<br> You can just do that,<br> pull phone records?<br> I work<br> for a pretty powerful guy.<br> Yeah, we're close,<br> we were close for a while.<br> That's till recently, of course. Our career<br> paths sort of went in different directions.<br> At least you have your life.<br> There's nothing sinister going on here.<br> At this point,<br> we just need...<br> to look at every aspect of her life<br> and find everyone that knew her.<br> You never know<br> what you're gonna find.<br> - Did you find anything?<br> - No, no, not really.<br> Not really?<br> You mean...<br> A little bit, actually.<br> I did speak to other classmates,<br> and they told me she was pretty wild.<br> Wild? Yeah, she was wild.<br> Wild enough you can be sure the tabloids<br> are gonna have a field day.<br> Have you spoken to them?<br> Um, me? No.<br> But somebody somewhere's gonna talk.<br> - But not you.<br> - Uh-uh, no.<br> - It's okay if you have. We're not gonna lock you up.<br> - No, I haven't.<br> So no one like,<br> maybe, the National Enquirer...<br> or one of those<br> silly television programs...<br> - that show, um... Access...<br> - Confidential?<br> No, no, no.<br> I don't know anything.<br> The last time I talked to her it<br> was just, "The kid this, the kid that. "<br> According to our records,<br> you spoke to her on the 15th.<br> - Three weeks ago?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, that makes sense.<br> I... She was going to Vegas.<br> Oh, is that right? Vegas?<br> She asked me to go along with her.<br> It was gonna be her treat.<br> I couldn't go<br> because I had to work.<br> We were gonna stay at one of those<br> ritzy new places. The, um, Bellage..?<br> - The Bellagio? Right.<br> - Yeah.<br> - With the contortionist.<br> - I've never been.<br> You've been going through my desk.<br> It never crossed my mind<br> when I was a younger woman...<br> that I'd be this age<br> and not have kids.<br> Somehow in my mind, kids.<br> Raising them,<br> making them good people.<br> That's what I wanted.<br> Then I met you,<br> and I realized that I'd be...<br> trading my dreams<br> so that we could live yours.<br> We sacrificed all of that<br> so we could do good.<br> We have done good.<br> I was never prouder when you fought to make<br> hate crimes a capital and federal offense.<br> You stood so tall,<br> defying the world, and you won.<br> It was then that I realized that all<br> of our sacrifices were not in vain...<br> that you were a good man.<br> And now, everything you have<br> ever achieved will be eliminated...<br> because, with this horrible filth...<br> you'll go down<br> as a second-rate Joe McCarthy.<br> Your problem, Shelly, is that<br> you have no sense of history.<br> She's no good.<br> Come on!<br> Come on.<br> See, Daphne? This is<br> how you get to the top.<br> Lew?<br> I have an issue to speak of,<br> and I'm most gravely concerned.<br> If this body will indulge me,<br> I have before me...<br> a perfect example of the need<br> for this institution...<br> to pass the Internet Libel<br> Protection Act.<br> In the Nichols Report piece...<br> posted to 40 million<br> Internet subscribers...<br> it is claimed that you,<br> Senator...<br> were involved in a sexual imbroglio<br> while in college.<br> That is...<br> trading favors...<br> with several partners in exchange<br> for entry into a sorority.<br> Though I will not waste<br> the committee's time with such...<br> nefarious and sleazy innuendoes...<br> I will not deny the senator<br> her right to respond.<br> Mr. Chairman,<br> I have nothing to...<br> I will not respond<br> to this article.<br> I say "Bravo" to you, Senator.<br> Bravo to you.<br> First let me state...<br> that I encourage<br> every American...<br> and every citizen<br> on this planet to boycott...<br> the Nichols Report.<br> This is the type of filth<br> and degenerate pornography...<br> that should not see<br> the light of day.<br> I can only assume, Senator,<br> that you will...<br> not only bring suit<br> against the perpetrators of...<br> but also against the remarkable look-alike<br> who appears in these disgusting photos.<br> And when you do file suit, know that it<br> comes with my full support.<br> Your refusal to deny this report<br> of sexual deviance...<br> will not have an effect<br> on this committee...<br> on whether or not it votes to advise<br> and consent to your nomination.<br> Mr. President, do you have a comment on<br> the allegations made on the Internet today?<br> I'm not gonna discuss any allegations,<br> especially those on the Internet.<br> But, sir, the sexual allegations were made<br> very public today by Congressman Runyon.<br> And I'm sure he quite regrets that.<br> Sir, if you agree with the allegations,<br> or agree the allegations are accurate...<br> do you think that Senator Hanson<br> is morally fit to take office?<br> I'll tell you what.<br> I'm sure that<br> President Mateo and I...<br> would both welcome the votes<br> of only those people...<br> with sexual indiscretions<br> in their past.<br> We'd be landslide victors<br> every time.<br> Hey, Sheila.<br> - They've been waiting for you for about ten minutes.<br> - Okay. Hey.<br> - Henry, I gotta talk to you in five minutes, okay?<br> - Okay.<br> How about "Her involvement<br> in prostitution"?<br> No, no. You gotta couch it<br> like it's something...<br> for the FB...<br> the AG to investigate.<br> - Hi, Reggie.<br> - Hi.<br> Well, how about,<br> "How embarrassing it is...<br> - that the... " No, no, no.<br> - Who...<br> - What?<br> - Where's Gilmore?<br> - Gilmore.<br> - Um, Idaho? Iowa?<br> Can I interrupt for one second?<br> We're all set with America Live.<br> What are you guys<br> talking about?<br> We're just going over<br> our statement...<br> in response to<br> The Washington Post story.<br> - What story?<br> - The one that says the secret investigation is ongoing...<br> to determine whether<br> she accepted money...<br> for her activities<br> in college.<br> I didn't hear about this.<br> Well, it's, uh...<br> It's, um...<br> It'll be in...<br> tomorrow afternoon's edition.<br> Just in time for the congressman<br> to make his statement...<br> and just in time for it to stick in<br> the minds of Americans over the weekend.<br> Wh... What's the source?<br> Where'd they get the story?<br> - Unnamed sources close to the investigation.<br> - I see.<br> Al.<br> - Al!<br> - Yes?<br> We can, um... Let's...<br> Let's dot the I's, cross the T's<br> on this one later.<br> All right, thank you.<br> I, uh...<br> I think I have some self-righteous<br> indignation coming my way.<br> Well, is there any truth<br> whatsoever to the story?<br> - There will be an investigation.<br> - She's gonna have the truth on her side.<br> - She's gonna deny it and make us all look like fools.<br> - Let her.<br> Let her deny just that part<br> of the story.<br> - Hold here.<br> - What? Oh.<br> That's all right.<br> I can do that myself. Yeah.<br> Thank you.<br> - America Live is not in the circus business.<br> - Pete's always fair.<br> Should I hear anything in this?<br> You're gonna be vice president.<br> - You'll talk about legitimate issues of concern.<br> - Right.<br> Where is the senator's monitor?<br> There is no monitor for her.<br> She'll hear Pete in the earpiece.<br> That is a piece of shit.<br> We talked about this, Ray.<br> If Peter's gonna be able to see her,<br> she has to be able to see him.<br> - He's got a sensory advantage over her.<br> - You wanna pull her?<br> I'm not talking about pulling her.<br> I'm just saying it's bullshit.<br> She was just great in the hearings<br> today. Cool and collected.<br> - Steve Poullet.<br> - Hi.<br> Should I hear anything?<br> Oh, I got it. Okay, great.<br> Oh, it's that one.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Can't hear...<br> Yeah, right, got it.<br> Okay, I've got<br> the intro now.<br> Thank you for having me, Peter.<br> Sure, that'd be fine.<br> Well, it has been<br> a taxing experience...<br> but if we're forced to take<br> the voters out of the equation...<br> I think that the vetting system<br> by simple necessity must be arduous.<br> Mmm.<br> I have to plead motherhood<br> on that one, Pete...<br> but I not only served<br> on the Foreign Relations Committee...<br> I sponsored the Hanson-Fineman Bill<br> which readjusted the War Powers Act...<br> to allow the executive to respond<br> to state-sponsored terrorism...<br> like that of Iraq, Libya,<br> North Korea, for instance.<br> But rather than boring you<br> with my rsum...<br> I'd rather answer your questions<br> on specific issues of foreign policy.<br> I suppose I could ask you, Mr. Crenshaw,<br> how you'd feel in the same situation.<br> Why would I answer that for you?<br> Sorry. It's simply a privacy issue.<br> Look, I won't address issues<br> of sexuality in a hearing room...<br> or on national television<br> or anywhere else for that matter.<br> - Where's the control room for America Live?<br> - Down the hall.<br> Excuse me.<br> The control room for America Live?<br> - Where is the fucking control room?<br> - Right down there.<br> Fuck!<br> Down here, down here, down here!<br> Don't tell me<br> we're gettin' sandbagged!<br> We're getting sandbagged! I knew<br> you couldn't trust this fucking guy!<br> Senator Hanson,<br> do you recognize Mr. Poullet?<br> Un, no. I don't have a monitor,<br> so I can't see him.<br> The truth is,<br> Lainey and I had that one incident.<br> I don't believe we ever<br> saw each other again after that.<br> To her credit, she was very drunk<br> when she had sex...<br> with my friends,<br> uh, my brothers and I.<br> A sandbag is what it is.<br> He's fucking your friend.<br> He has obviously infiltrated<br> your show.<br> Mrs. Hanson, you still have not taken<br> a stand on the accuracy of this report.<br> It's very accurate,<br> and those photos are accurate too.<br> We had them on the frat house<br> bulletin board for months.<br> We called that<br> "Life in the Sex Laine. "<br> - What are we gonna do now?<br> - We're gonna sue him.<br> I will not dignify those remarks<br> or your questions with a response.<br> Good evening.<br> The guy's a jerk. We're never gonna<br> put our people on that show again.<br> Some asshole called in<br> and made this idiot claim.<br> Hell, they've gotta investigate.<br> The whole situation's<br> a son of a bitch.<br> I would like to start<br> by saying...<br> that much has been made of the reports<br> in the press of an investigation...<br> into the possible...<br> possible, I say again...<br> criminal behavior<br> on the part of the nominee.<br> This committee will wait<br> for a report from the FBI...<br> before taking this matter up.<br> However, I'll once again afford<br> the nominee an opportunity to respond.<br> I, too, will wait for the FBI report<br> before responding.<br> Madam Senator.<br> Tell us a little bit about your family.<br> You have a son.<br> Mm-hmm. Yes, I have<br> one six-year-old boy, Timothy.<br> That's a very nice age.<br> Now, I see here<br> that when you...<br> had Timothy,<br> you were absent from your duty...<br> for a few months'<br> maternity leave.<br> - It's the right of every mother to be able to take maternity...<br> - Paid maternity leave.<br> Yes. I don't believe we should penalize<br> our citizens for having children.<br> I think I'm on safe ground saying that<br> valuing motherhood is quite nonpartisan.<br> - Um, were you to get pregnant again...<br> do you plan<br> to take maternity leave?<br> Um, I've not given that<br> any consideration.<br> No? Are you still able<br> to bear children?<br> Yes, I am...<br> I believe, yes, I am.<br> Yet you have not given<br> this matter any consideration.<br> Perhaps that means...<br> No, strike that.<br> Madam Senator...<br> let us assume you ascended<br> to the presidency...<br> and you were to have a child<br> during your term.<br> Would you cede your duties<br> to your vice president and for how long?<br> Mr. Chairman, would the chair expect to<br> have the designate assure this committee...<br> that she would have her tubes tied<br> before she assume office?<br> - Mr. Chairman, I humbly request a point of order.<br> - You will be afforded one.<br> - With all due respect...<br> - You will be afforded one when I am finished.<br> The truth is that while we have not put a<br> seal on the concept of having another child...<br> my husband and I practice<br> birth control.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Okay, I would<br> now like to...<br> enter the arena of loyalty.<br> Loyalty is a revered quality<br> among vice presidents. Would you agree?<br> - Yes, very much so. Yes.<br> - Yet you chose to officially move...<br> from the Republican to the Democratic party<br> when you left the House to run for the Senate.<br> I view switching parties as a testament<br> to my loyalty to my country.<br> I felt that the Republican party had shifted<br> from the ideals that I cherished through my youth.<br> As a Republican,<br> did you ever...<br> vote along party lines<br> but against your own beliefs?<br> No, never.<br> - You still believe in every vote you made?<br> - Yes.<br> - Including your vote to impeach President Clinton?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> That was an issue of fairness.<br> The president,<br> as commander in chief, stood by...<br> while several military officers, including<br> candidates for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs...<br> were prosecuted for adultery<br> or were not permitted...<br> to advance their careers.<br> I am opposed to making adultery, or even<br> lying about it, a crime in our armed forces.<br> But while it is a law, it should be<br> enforced without consideration of rank...<br> even if that rank<br> is commander in chief.<br> Perhaps the senator is unaware that commander<br> in chief is not actually a military rank.<br> I am aware of that.<br> What I think we can say of President Clinton<br> is that he was not guilty but responsible.<br> "Not guilty but responsible. "<br> I am...<br> I like that.<br> I, uh, I-I may, uh... I may use that.<br> - If you wish, you can go ahead.<br> - Thank you.<br> When... When considering you<br> for the vice presidency...<br> we must also consider your worthiness<br> as commander in chief.<br> - Would you agree?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> In that case, given your feelings<br> on the matter...<br> have you ever<br> committed adultery?<br> - No, I have not.<br> - No?<br> You're quite sure? Madam Senator, you<br> understand that, uh, you are under oath.<br> Yes, I understand that, between the two<br> of us, I'm the one that's under oath.<br> When you guys go before the Antitrust<br> Committee, don't you want Hank on your side?<br> Sure, but not at any price.<br> Last time we spoke,<br> you were sitting where you are now.<br> Hank was sitting where Len is. You started<br> telling him what a shame it would be...<br> if the refrigeration systems<br> on the trucks went out.<br> Hank's a hothead,<br> and he took that as a threat.<br> If we were threatening him,<br> he'd know it.<br> That's what I thought,<br> but now we have some massaging to do.<br> Hank's gotta be treated<br> with kid gloves.<br> - Senator Hanson? Congressman Webster's here to see you.<br> - Sorry. Yep?<br> - Guess we got our ten minutes.<br> - Okay, send him in.<br> No, I want to resolve this.<br> I do. Just give me a few minutes.<br> If you want something to drink,<br> Jerry will take care of you.<br> - We're gonna get back into this?<br> - We will. We will.<br> Senator, you want me to sit in? Make sure<br> the congressman's clear on everything?<br> We'll be fine. Won't we, Mr. Webster?<br> We'll be all right. Thanks.<br> Proud of yourself?<br> So, what can I do for you,<br> Mr. Webster?<br> I'm sure you're wondering<br> why I'm here.<br> I think you're here because you want<br> to know why I'm not fighting back.<br> Because despite it all, you've got<br> some odd sense of fair play.<br> You're kicking my ass. It's gone from feeling<br> like easy pickings to out-and-out bullying.<br> I feel like there should be some back and<br> forth between us, you and the committee.<br> I'll give you back and forth on Social<br> Security, relations with Israel...<br> on the Dow Jones, the census,<br> almost everything, but not this.<br> No, not my personal life.<br> It's just nobody's business.<br> That's not what the people will tell you; the<br> people will tell you it is their business...<br> that you're setting standards<br> of morality for their children.<br> Especially their girls.<br> Have you ever heard<br> of Isaac Lamm?<br> - Isaac Lamm? No.<br> - He was the first one to come before HUAC...<br> the House Un-American<br> Activities Committee.<br> He was also the first one to name names,<br> first to cooperate with the government.<br> The dominoes fell from there.<br> Careers crushed,<br> families destroyed.<br> Just imagine, Mr. Webster, if Mr. Lamm had<br> just said, "Fuck you," to the committee.<br> Imagine how much harder<br> he would've made it for them.<br> Are you accusing the committee<br> of sexual McCarthyism?<br> Well, it's not necessary<br> to make the accusation.<br> Oh, I just can't respond to the<br> committee's lightly veiled accusations...<br> because it's not okay<br> for them to be made.<br> Or maybe you can't respond because the<br> answers you have to give are too embarrassing.<br> You know what?<br> You're young.<br> That's okay. That's okay.<br> You're young.<br> I'm gonna choose to be amused by your<br> naivet, give you the benefit of the doubt.<br> I'm gonna spell it out<br> for you even more clearly.<br> If I were a man,<br> nobody would care...<br> how many sexual partners<br> I had in college.<br> And if it's not relevant for a man,<br> it's not relevant for a woman.<br> Jerry, send the folks back in, please.<br> I gotta finish this up.<br> He's not a bad man.<br> He believes in what he's doing.<br> There's an odd sort<br> of integrity there.<br> But in this business,<br> with so much at stake...<br> it's not enough to believe<br> in yourself, you have to be right.<br> This is an ideological rape<br> of all women.<br> - Timmy, that's a little too high.<br> - Okay, Mommy.<br> Thank you, sweetie.<br> Well, then I'll survive it<br> for all of us.<br> Tomorrow morning Congressman Marshall<br> is gonna ask you questions.<br> He's going to hit you<br> with abortion.<br> I promise you that Shelly will find<br> some way to call you a baby killer.<br> We're ready for him.<br> Our position papers are first-rate.<br> - Every one of them.<br> - You let him finish.<br> Then you look him in the eye<br> and you ask him...<br> "Mr. Runyon, 20 years ago<br> your wife Maggie had an abortion.<br> Do you think her a murderer?"<br> He's a hypocrite.<br> No, he's not.<br> Shelly has no idea.<br> Are you saying you would appoint<br> a Supreme Court justice...<br> based on his being pro-choice?<br> Mr. Marshall, the vice president<br> does not appoint Supreme Court justices.<br> Should you succeed the president<br> or even advise the president?<br> I would be inclined,<br> though not without flexibility...<br> to disregard any man or woman who is<br> pro-life from serving on the High Court.<br> So you would allow a personal political<br> belief to enter into such a decision?<br> Abortion isn't<br> a constitutional issue.<br> The fine ladies and gentlemen<br> who serve on the Supreme Court...<br> which is now stacked<br> with right-wing appointees...<br> have no business deciding whether women<br> have to resort to back-alley abortions...<br> You mean they have no business deciding<br> whether women have a license to commit murder.<br> Mr. Marshall, your time has expired.<br> Sir, if the distinguished "gentlelady"<br> from Ohio would answer the question...<br> I think the lady has made clear<br> her propensity for abortion.<br> - Come on, Mr. Runyon!<br> - Mr. Lewis, you do not have speaking privileges.<br> Mr. Chairman, I find your term,<br> "propensity for abortion"...<br> misrepresentative of my position.<br> I have a propensity<br> for a woman's right to choose.<br> - To abort a child!<br> - A fetus.<br> To kill a baby<br> as it grows in the womb.<br> Personally, Senator...<br> I do not believe that it is<br> the right of our citizens...<br> to... to butcher<br> a defenseless human being simply...<br> simply as a matter of choice.<br> At the risk of my own future,<br> I tell you this:<br> If you support the right...<br> of a woman to choose,<br> you are supporting...<br> nothing less than<br> a- a-a holocaust of the unborn.<br> Mr. Chairman,<br> are you calling me...<br> I believe my position<br> on this issue is clear.<br> Yes, madam,<br> it most certainly is.<br> God, I love this game.<br> When she tries to tell me<br> how to do it, I do it my way.<br> Then she comes back and changes it<br> afterwards, and that way...<br> Jeez.<br> Good one, sir.<br> You're an all-weather golfer,<br> I see.<br> What kind of stick<br> you using there?<br> - It's a putting stick.<br> - Right, putting stick.<br> When I asked for you last week,<br> they said you were in Vegas.<br> - Business, sir.<br> - Vegas is business?<br> I did blow<br> a roll of quarters.<br> Will you excuse us?<br> - How's that cough doing?<br> - Aah.<br> That's her casino account balance.<br> She offered to take her sorority sister<br> to Vegas, her treat.<br> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole<br> truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?<br> I do.<br> Please state your name<br> for the record.<br> Cynthia C-H-A-R-L-T-O-N Lee.<br> Thank you.<br> Please be seated.<br> We will start the questioning<br> with Mr. Skakle.<br> Mr. Skakle, the five-minute rule<br> is in effect.<br> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<br> Miss Lee.<br> Miss Lee, hello. I'm over here.<br> Thank you for joining us.<br> Now, you are under subpoena,<br> is that correct?<br> Yes.<br> - Miss Lee, could you speak directly into the mike?<br> - Yes.<br> I understand you're nervous, but believe<br> me when I tell you you're among friends.<br> Miss Lee, you are not married.<br> No... No.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - But you once were.<br> I was married<br> to William Hanson.<br> - Who is now married to the nominee.<br> - Yes.<br> He married Laine after our divorce.<br> It was about seven years ago.<br> Divorce. Right.<br> I've read your divorce papers.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> that by the way is tab 76.<br> They cite<br> irreconcilable differences.<br> Could you tell us, what were<br> those irreconcilable differences?<br> I can't really pinpoint them.<br> - Was your husband physically violent to you?<br> - No.<br> Did you have financial disagreements or<br> disagreements over how to raise your kids?<br> We didn't have children.<br> - Were there infidelities?<br> - Yes. There was one.<br> Is it safe to say that this infidelity<br> precipitated the divorce?<br> Miss Lee, please answer<br> the question verbally. Was that a yes?<br> Yes, it was.<br> It was a yes.<br> - Did you, ma'am, have the affair?<br> - No.<br> - It was your husband then?<br> - Yes.<br> Will...<br> Will was in charge...<br> of Laine Billings's<br> first senatorial campaign.<br> He was with her all the time.<br> Are you suggesting the senator, the<br> nominee, had an affair with your husband?<br> - Once again, Miss Lee...<br> - I'm sorry. Yes. Yes, yes.<br> Thank you.<br> Did the nominee know<br> Mr. Hanson was married?<br> Laine was my friend.<br> My good, good friend.<br> Miss Lee, would you explain to this<br> committee as you did in your deposition...<br> how you discovered<br> that the nominee was involved...<br> in an affair<br> with your husband?<br> Yes. Um...<br> On the night of the elections,<br> I was at home.<br> I had the flu.<br> I was watching TV, watching Laine<br> about to make her acceptance speech.<br> I was very sad<br> that I couldn't be there.<br> It was a triumph<br> for Laine and my husband.<br> She was up at the podium.<br> Will was by her side.<br> He was holding her hand<br> in victory.<br> On the other side<br> of Laine...<br> she was just sort of clasping<br> that person's hand.<br> But with Will...<br> their hands were interlaced.<br> It was odd<br> that I noticed it, but...<br> Um, my doorbell rang.<br> I answered the door,<br> and there was a gentleman there...<br> dressed very nicely,<br> he had a yellow tie on.<br> He had papers for me.<br> - Papers? I'm sorry.<br> - Separation papers.<br> Since the committee chose to humiliate a private<br> woman in the most public possible setting...<br> I would like to apologize<br> to her alike...<br> and I will also do so privately<br> when she allows me to do so.<br> Um, what I did to Miss Lee<br> was wrong.<br> It was not done out of malice.<br> Indeed the opposite.<br> Um...<br> love is an involuntary reflex,<br> and I fell victim to it.<br> Um, I deeply regret<br> causing Cynthia pain...<br> and it is especially saddening<br> for me because...<br> of how close we once were.<br> And whether or not the affair<br> that Will and I had...<br> should have any bearing on my assuming<br> office is for the committee to decide.<br> I dare not assume that I have the objective<br> wisdom to make that determination. Thank you.<br> - Senator, are you suggesting the public...<br> - Okay, she's had a long day.<br> You know what she's going through.<br> Come on, come on.<br> She was your best friend.<br> Runyon deposed Will's<br> ex-wife today, and, uh...<br> she stated that Will and I<br> had had an affair...<br> She saw her fucking holding hands,<br> interlocked fingers with this gal...<br> and she knew<br> that she'd been fucking him.<br> That's what she said.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - It's a bad beat.<br> I'm not sure that I get<br> the point of all this.<br> - You said under oath that you never committed adultery.<br> - That's right.<br> - You perjured yourself.<br> - I didn't commit adultery.<br> - You were fucking Will when he was married.<br> - All right.<br> Even the most loose definition of<br> committing adultery would not include that.<br> Goddamn it, she's right.<br> You're right.<br> In order for it to be committing adultery,<br> she'd have to be married at the time.<br> You're nitpicking<br> in reverse now.<br> Your husband may have been<br> an adulterer. You're not. Fine.<br> What you are is a sex-crazed, home-wrecking<br> machine. The female Warren Beatty.<br> Runyon knows<br> that you're clean of the perjury...<br> but he's got the world thinking you're<br> something out of a bad soap opera.<br> You've goddamned crystallized the difference<br> between being guilty and being responsible.<br> Are you asking me<br> to step down, sir?<br> No, it's not gonna be that easy for you,<br> and it's not gonna be that easy for them.<br> They caught you being<br> a human being. That's all.<br> I'll die before Shelly Runyon<br> checkmates me.<br> I think the president's trying to say<br> the Sitting Bull routine isn't working.<br> - The Sitting Bull routine?<br> - No!<br> Fight back.<br> Show them Laine Hanson isn't gonna take<br> their shit. Take the fight out of 'em.<br> - What's the process?<br> - Confess.<br> - Confess? - Yeah,<br> confess. - Confess.<br> Confess to the gang-bang.<br> Confess to all of it.<br> - Look what it did for Clinton with Flowers.<br> - Play it any way you want.<br> It didn't hurt his numbers.<br> It improved his numbers.<br> Show indignation about how a man would never<br> have to go through hell for having done this.<br> Confess and demonstrate<br> to the young women of America...<br> how such sexual impropriety<br> can ruin their lives.<br> Confess and preach about the dangers<br> that alcohol can bring to you.<br> For God's sakes, just confess!<br> I understand, Kermit, truly.<br> I understand, and you know what?<br> It's really nobody's business.<br> Well, it is<br> our fucking business!<br> Listen, Laine...<br> I don't care who you fucked...<br> and how many times<br> in how many positions...<br> as long as it doesn't threaten<br> the administration.<br> You can be cavalier<br> on your own dime.<br> Mr. President.<br> I am fully prepared<br> to step down...<br> but my personal life...<br> and my past...<br> are just that.<br> But I will do<br> whatever you say.<br> Show them why Laine Hanson is my nominee<br> with your closing statement.<br> Mr. Chairman...<br> ladies and gentlemen<br> of the committee:<br> Uh, remarkably enough, it seems<br> that I have some explaining to do.<br> So...<br> let me be absolutely clear.<br> I stand for a woman's right<br> to choose.<br> I stand for the elimination<br> of the death penalty.<br> I stand for a strong<br> and growing armed forces...<br> because we must stomp out genocide<br> on this planet...<br> and I believe that that<br> is a cause worth dying for.<br> I stand for seeing every gun<br> taken out of every home. Period.<br> I stand for making the selling of<br> cigarettes to our youth a federal offense.<br> I stand for term limits<br> and campaign reform.<br> And, Mr. Chairman, I stand for<br> the separation of church and state...<br> and the reason that I stand for that is the<br> same reason that I believe our forefathers did.<br> It is not there to protect religion<br> from the grasp of government...<br> but to protect our government<br> from the grasp of religious fanaticism.<br> I may be an atheist...<br> but that does not mean I do not<br> go to church; I do go to church.<br> The church I go to is the one<br> that emancipated the slaves...<br> that gave women<br> the right to vote.<br> It gave us every freedom<br> that we hold dear.<br> My church is this very chapel<br> of democracy that we sit in together...<br> and I do not need God to tell me<br> what are my moral absolutes.<br> I need my heart,<br> my brain and this church.<br> Get in there, get in there.<br> Oh, shoot!<br> Come on, come on, come on!<br> - Senator? Oh...<br> - Hello, Freshman.<br> Senator, I just wanted<br> to steal a couple of seconds.<br> What? See what whores do<br> on their time off?<br> Listen,<br> I know the things I've done.<br> They may not have been nice<br> or considered politically savvy...<br> but they have served the greater good<br> and they have been honest.<br> Okay.<br> Look, I know<br> you're not a whore.<br> - I'm not gonna talk about it.<br> - I know. You're not talking about it.<br> Somebody else<br> has come forward.<br> Somebody else from the night<br> of the incident sent me this letter.<br> They didn't send it to me.<br> They sent it to the committee.<br> I just happen to be in charge<br> of all the correspondence.<br> I don't think you can keep quiet<br> about what's in there.<br> Mr. Runyon has a copy,<br> and now so do you.<br> I beg you, Senator,<br> to deal with this.<br> - How long is this flight?<br> - About an hour and 40 minutes.<br> POTUS is scheduled to address<br> the American Legion on the third.<br> - American Legion? Who approved that?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I thought he had the D.A.R. Dinner<br> that night. - We have a five-hour window.<br> - Hey, Chuck.<br> - Hey, Kermit.<br> Did you get the AP reports?<br> - What's that?<br> - POTUS's poll numbers are down 23%.<br> - And Hanson's in the low 30s.<br> - Get in there. I'll talk to you in a minute.<br> - Are you Willomina?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You asked to see me?<br> - Is this your handiwork?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - How many people have seen this?<br> - I gave it only to the director.<br> - And who have you talked to about this?<br> - Nobody.<br> Not a husband? Boyfriend?<br> - Grandma in Kalamazoo?<br> - No, sir. Nobody.<br> - Keep it that way.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You did a good job,<br> Special Agent.<br> Sir! Uh, sir, I just... I just wanted<br> to ask, ask you. Um, well...<br> Are you gonna dump her?<br> Sir, this may be really,<br> really inappropriate...<br> but if that's what you guys<br> are thinking...<br> Please, you can't do it.<br> She's hope.<br> Hope that the standards...<br> That there is no double standard.<br> Hope that the goals<br> can be the same.<br> You know what?<br> You're goddamn right.<br> That was absolutely inappropriate.<br> Robertson.<br> I wouldn't take it too hard.<br> It's not exactly fair<br> when six foxes and one chicken...<br> are voting on<br> what to have for dinner.<br> Well, that's not<br> playing fair. I'll give you that.<br> You want an oatmeal cookie?<br> - Trevor?<br> - I'm getting them, sir.<br> I find these giant raisins...<br> Well, you'll see.<br> Taste like grapes.<br> Shelly, you really made<br> a mess of things for me.<br> You sure did clobber me.<br> Isn't it possible, sir,<br> that I was... that I was acting...<br> - in the best interests of the United States?<br> - No.<br> It's not possible.<br> That's what pisses me off. It's all<br> about retribution for Hartford.<br> Thank you, Trevor.<br> That'll be all.<br> - Go ahead. Try this. It's wonderful.<br> - No.<br> I may have taken the presidency<br> from you, but you one-upped me.<br> You took away my legacy.<br> I look at her and I see someone who<br> has proven the capacity for disloyalty.<br> Or the capacity<br> for seeing the light.<br> We're both sticking<br> to our guns.<br> The difference is...<br> mine are loaded.<br> Look, it doesn't matter, does it?<br> She's not being confirmed.<br> We can talk for days<br> about greatness and leadership...<br> but Laine Hanson<br> will not be confirmed.<br> I have seven from your side<br> who are giving her the ax.<br> Oh, indeed, the ax?<br> We can go through<br> the process of a vote.<br> You can waste time...<br> and suffer the humiliation,<br> or... or we can just move on.<br> - There's a lot of good folk to choose from.<br> - Who?<br> Who can I be certain<br> you'll confirm?<br> The man you wanted in the first place:<br> Jack Hathaway.<br> Shelly.<br> Good man.<br> Okay, Shelly...<br> I'll give you Governor Jack Hathaway,<br> but I wanna make damn sure...<br> - you'll give him a smooth ride.<br> - My word. There's a reason they call me Honest Shell.<br> Irony, Shelly.<br> I want an insurance policy.<br> I want a piece of the rock.<br> I wanna make sure...<br> you're not gonna pull<br> some kind of baloney out of your hat...<br> and make a mockery<br> of my administration again.<br> Listen. This is<br> what I'm gonna do.<br> I'm gonna ask Mrs. Hanson and<br> Mr. Hathaway up to the Oval Office...<br> before the D.A.R. Banquet<br> tomorrow night.<br> I want you there as well,<br> but, Shelly...<br> before then, I need you<br> to marry yourself to this guy.<br> I need you to make a public statement<br> that makes his sinking your sinking.<br> - Otherwise...<br> - But I'm not sure I can...<br> Let's make this confirmation<br> fast and furious.<br> - Help me save face on this one.<br> - Okay.<br> Oh, man. Mr. Runyon,<br> prefer I take you around back?<br> - No, I'll be fine.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> How do you respond to the rumors<br> that Mrs. Hanson has withdrawn her name?<br> That is a rumor<br> I've not yet heard.<br> Have you heard about the possibility<br> of Governor Hathaway...<br> - returning to the list of vice presidential...<br> - Governor Hathaway is a fine man.<br> Will he have a smoother ride<br> than Mrs. Hanson?<br> Let me go on record<br> as saying...<br> that in my opinion there is<br> no man alive... no Democrat alive...<br> who could bring...<br> more integrity<br> to the office of the vice presidency.<br> I would stake my career...<br> on Governor Hathaway's, uh,<br> smooth and efficient confirmation.<br> As for Laine Hanson...<br> - Got everybody, Glenda?<br> - Yes, sir. He says you can go in whenever you're ready.<br> - Great. Hello, Jack.<br> - Kermit.<br> - Fiona, you're looking particularly fetching this evening.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - I believe this is the first one of these affairs for you, right?<br> - Yes.<br> - My 37th.<br> - You look great.<br> - Hello, Shelly.<br> - Newman.<br> Everybody would understand if you<br> wanted to delay for two weeks.<br> I'm not sure I could stomach<br> another two weeks.<br> Oh, Jack.<br> - Jerry. Good.<br> - How are you?<br> Mr. Hanson.<br> - Gentlemen. Jack.<br> - Mr. President.<br> There he is! Shelly!<br> Hello, Mr. President.<br> Uh, you know what?<br> Before we get started...<br> I can't stomach the idea...<br> of touching that chichi food we always<br> get served at these state dinners.<br> - Glenda?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Could we put together a grilled<br> cheese sandwich? Muenster on rye.<br> Right away.<br> Oh, sorry. Where are my manners?<br> You guys want anything?<br> - No, thank you, sir.<br> - Shelly?<br> Jesus, uh, Shell,<br> those were some...<br> very nice things<br> you said about Jack.<br> Jack, there. I understand<br> that you two have never met.<br> - Laine Hanson, Jack Hathaway.<br> - It's a pleasure.<br> - I'm quite in awe of you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Mr. President?<br> - Yes, Glenda?<br> - Sir, the kitchen's all out of Muenster.<br> Really? Wow.<br> Well, um, let's get on that.<br> We don't want the wheels<br> coming off the wagon.<br> This is, uh...<br> This is quite an event.<br> Here we are. Quite a sad event.<br> - Mr. President, if I may?<br> - Yes, please.<br> A short while ago, you told me that you<br> thought I might be the future of the party.<br> I know that these<br> are tough times...<br> and the future is uncertain...<br> but I'm very pleased to think that I might<br> be able to help make things a little smoother.<br> The future, yes.<br> Well, there is one thing...<br> quite certain<br> about the future.<br> - What's that?<br> - Sir?<br> - You have the right to remain silent...<br> - Fred.<br> - I have to read him his rights.<br> - Fred, the governor, he knows his rights.<br> You know your rights, right, Jack?<br> You don't have to humiliate him.<br> You fucked up, buddy.<br> - The girl, do you know what she was?<br> - What girl?<br> - The girl in the river.<br> - She was a paralegal.<br> - Before that.<br> - She was military. Fourteen Golf.<br> We found the money that you put<br> in her account at the Bellagio.<br> - Two hundred thousand dollars.<br> - And that ad in...<br> - Soldier of Fortune.<br> - Yeah, Soldier of Fortune.<br> I don't mind confessing,<br> I am at a total fucking loss.<br> Shelly, he paid her<br> to go off the fucking bridge.<br> He paid her to save her.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> - Shelly, maybe I...<br> - You shouldn't say anything.<br> - Jack, look, we respect...<br> - You're going to have to come with me now.<br> Fred. We respect you.<br> We're trying to make this go<br> as smoothly as it possibly can.<br> I know you meant no harm.<br> - Hell, I don't even know... What would the charge be?<br> - Negligent homicide.<br> Oh, negligent homicide.<br> Sir.<br> - Good luck, Mrs. Hanson.<br> - You too.<br> Who doesn't want<br> a shortcut to greatness?<br> Oh, it's a goddamn shame<br> about the Muenster.<br> Mr. President.<br> Yeah, Shelly?<br> You set me up.<br> Just this once.<br> For the record, sir...<br> I find what you did<br> to be manipulative...<br> Mr. Chairman, let's just say...<br> "I'm guilty<br> but not responsible," hmm?<br> Shelly, you needn't worry<br> about us exposing the fact...<br> that you leaked all that horrible<br> material about Laine on the Internet.<br> We know that you were<br> just following your heart.<br> Yeah, Hartford,<br> it was a tough one.<br> But... Well, it doesn't<br> make a difference.<br> - She still is who she is.<br> - Yes, she is.<br> And you are who you are.<br> You're still coming<br> to the banquet, aren't you?<br> Because I'd love to see you.<br> Is your wife in town?<br> May I introduce<br> tonight's honoree, Miss Barr?<br> - Congressman Webster.<br> - Honor, madam.<br> And, Congressman,<br> you know the senator, of course.<br> We go about two feet back.<br> I asked them to have you seated<br> at my table tonight.<br> - If you want to break bread with me.<br> - Absolutely.<br> - Don't eat all the hors d'oeuvres.<br> - Shark steak sandwiches?<br> Yeah. Save me some.<br> Last time I shared one of these,<br> it was with the president of Russia.<br> Or maybe it was the kid<br> who won Wimbledon for the second time.<br> I'm honored, sir.<br> You're not supposed to inhale.<br> Maybe that's the first thing<br> you should've told me.<br> Recognize this affidavit?<br> Where'd you get that, sir?<br> Where you got yours.<br> Where Shelly Runyon got his.<br> From Mr. Webster.<br> He may not know<br> his right from his left...<br> but apparently<br> he does know right from wrong.<br> I understand you<br> even less now, Senator.<br> - You are an enigma wrapped in a riddle.<br> - Wrapped in a riddle.<br> Watch your step, Senator.<br> What if I told you that I'm just<br> busting at the seams...<br> to know what exactly<br> happened that night...<br> to hear the truth<br> from your own lips?<br> Totally off the record.<br> Not between the president and the senator,<br> but between the president and Laine.<br> Better than that.<br> Between Jackson and Laine.<br> Well, I had just turned 18<br> when I got to college...<br> and I had never been<br> away from home, not really.<br> And I was immediately...<br> I was immediately lonely.<br> And that's when<br> the sorority kicked in.<br> I wanted them,<br> they wanted me.<br> I was the daughter of the governor,<br> for chrissake.<br> - True blue catch.<br> - I guess so.<br> And like any other sorority,<br> they have an initiation, a rush.<br> And they have this girl, this woman<br> that Runyon deposed, Patty LaVamere.<br> She runs the sorority,<br> and she gives it to me straight:<br> If I wanna be in, I have to go to<br> their brother fraternity and have sex...<br> with two boys.<br> What a coup for them, huh?<br> Daughter of a big-time Republican<br> doing a frat house?<br> But I say,<br> "There's no chance. "<br> - The whole thing was pretty hairy.<br> - I bet.<br> But six beers later,<br> I'm talking a different tune...<br> so off we go<br> to the frat house.<br> Half the girls were there,<br> about a zillion boys.<br> They're cheering my name.<br> "Laine! Laine! Laine!"<br> And I'm just stumbling around.<br> Eventually I just say,<br> "I'm gonna go for it. "<br> If getting laid is a common initiation<br> for boys in the frat...<br> then why not for us, right?<br> - You're asking me?<br> - No, I'm not.<br> Oh, sorry.<br> Sorry. Go ahead.<br> That's okay.<br> So they send me<br> into this room.<br> It's dark and dim.<br> There are these two guys.<br> They both have towels<br> wrapped around their waists.<br> And the first guy,<br> he slips his towel off.<br> And I see his thing, and...<br> I take it in my hand...<br> and I say...<br> - It was the first thing that came into my head.<br> - What did you say?<br> I said,<br> "I'm sorry, I don't smoke. "<br> And then I just got<br> the hell out of there.<br> You okay, sir?<br> Oh, no, I'm just thinking what I'd pay<br> to be back in college again.<br> The next day, the campus<br> was rampant with word...<br> that I had been<br> the center of a gang-bang.<br> I mean, the governor's daughter.<br> Let me tell you.<br> That's one hell of a bell to un-ring.<br> - What about the photographs?<br> - Not me.<br> I never took my clothes off.<br> Even if I had, I've got<br> this big birthmark on my right thigh...<br> that the lady with the lovely physique<br> in the photo lacks.<br> - No witnesses?<br> - Pure urban legend.<br> A little bit of wishful thinking<br> thrown in, I think.<br> You know, Laine...<br> you could've looked those pricks<br> in the eye and told them the truth.<br> Under oath. Told them<br> they were full of shit.<br> And barring that,<br> you could've at least told me.<br> But see, it really wasn't any of your<br> business either, and it still isn't.<br> There's something about<br> almost puking on a Havana...<br> that just turns a girl...<br> to blush.<br> This letter from Jack Bennet...<br> and Larry Bellows, affidavit, I guess,<br> that you got from Webster.<br> It pretty much says<br> that nothing happened that night.<br> - They're ready to come forward to be deposed.<br> - That's very good of them.<br> So, that's it. The end.<br> Good guys win.<br> I'm gonna call a press conference<br> tomorrow, read that letter...<br> and damn it if you don't have<br> the fastest confirmation on record.<br> No, sir.<br> "No, sir"?<br> What, "No, sir"?<br> I would prefer that we not<br> have the press conference, sir.<br> Laine, maybe you've been out<br> of law school too long.<br> - This is what they call exculpatory evidence.<br> - Yes, I realize that.<br> - This is your ticket to wherever history is gonna take you.<br> - Yes.<br> But principles only mean something if you<br> stick by them when they're inconvenient.<br> If I ever did<br> answer the questions...<br> you know,<br> even to exonerate myself...<br> that would mean that it was okay for them<br> to have been asked in the first place...<br> and it isn't.<br> - You would sacrifice your reputation?<br> - Yes, I would.<br> People have sacrificed<br> a lot more for a lot less.<br> - We've got him! We have Goliath.<br> - Sir, are you all right, sir?<br> - It's okay, guys. Busted.<br> - POTUS is secure.<br> Of course, the president addressing<br> a joint session of Congress...<br> is always unusual,<br> always an event.<br> This speech is scheduled<br> to begin momentarily.<br> We understand the president<br> has arrived at the U.S. Capitol.<br> I don't care if I never<br> see any of these guys again.<br> Sources in the White House<br> have told us that the president...<br> - It's gonna be okay.<br> - Does intend to withdraw the name of Senator Laine B. Hanson...<br> I still have a year and a half on<br> my term. That's a long time to recover.<br> - Then there's always...<br> - Given the stunning charges made against Governor Hathaway...<br> - Laine, honey, it's gonna be fine.<br> - Those on the inside are suggesting...<br> - It's gonna be okay.<br> - The president will designate...<br> - Ambassador Francis J. Malloy as his number two.<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> Pace me at five to ten, okay?<br> ...after the greeting<br> of the president of the United States.<br> Mr. Speaker, the president<br> of the United States of America.<br> Thank you.<br> Napoleon once said, when asked to explain<br> the lack of great statesmen in the world...<br> that, "to get power...<br> you need to display<br> absolute pettiness.<br> To exercise power,<br> you need to show true greatness. "<br> Such pettiness and such greatness<br> are rarely found in one person.<br> I look upon the events<br> of the past weeks...<br> and I've never come so to grips<br> with that quotation.<br> So, ladies and gentlemen<br> of this Congress...<br> it pains my soul to tell you that you have<br> brought blood and shame under this great dome.<br> Your leadership has raised<br> the stakes of hate to a level...<br> where we can no longer separate<br> the demagogue from the truly inspired.<br> And believe this,<br> there are traitors among us.<br> And I'm not talking about those of you<br> who sided against your party leadership.<br> I'm talking about those of you<br> who were patriots to your party...<br> but traitors<br> to the necessary end result:<br> That of righteousness,<br> the truth...<br> the concept of making<br> the American dream blind to gender.<br> And you know,<br> I am not free of blame.<br> Right from the start<br> I should've come down here...<br> pointed a finger your way...<br> pointed a finger your way...<br> and asked you,<br> "Have you no decency, sir?"<br> Yesterday...<br> I met...<br> Mr. Runyon...<br> you may walk out on me,<br> you may walk out on this body...<br> but you cannot walk out<br> on the will of the American people.<br> Americans are a good people,<br> they're a just people, Mr. Runyon...<br> and they will forgive you,<br> but they will not forget.<br> Hate and ego<br> have no place residing...<br> in what my good friend Laine Hanson<br> calls the chapel of democracy.<br> So, let me make one thing clear.<br> You come at us with whatever weapons<br> that you have in your arsenal...<br> but there is<br> no weapon as powerful...<br> as that of an idea<br> whose time has come.<br> A woman will serve in the highest level<br> of the Executive. Simple as that.<br> Yesterday...<br> I spoke with Laine Hanson.<br> I told her that she could decide<br> her own destiny.<br> If she wanted to continue<br> her fight for confirmation...<br> that I would stand beside her.<br> She has asked me<br> to allow her to step aside.<br> She told me that she wanted<br> my administration to end on a note...<br> of triumph<br> and not controversy.<br> Understand, those of you who worked<br> to bring Laine Hanson down...<br> that she asked to have her name<br> withdrawn from consideration...<br> not because she isn't great,<br> but because she isn't petty.<br> Because those two<br> conflicting leadership traits...<br> could not live as one<br> within her body or her soul.<br> Greatness.<br> It comes in many forms.<br> Sometimes it comes in the form<br> of sacrifice. That's the loneliest form.<br> Now, it turns out<br> that Laine Hanson is a woman...<br> an American<br> of devout principle...<br> and she has inspired me<br> to act alike...<br> and I cannot accept<br> Senator Hanson's withdrawal.<br> And I'm now calling for an immediate<br> vote of confirmation of Laine Hanson.<br> And, Mr. Speaker...<br> I would like to make this<br> a live roll call.<br> I want to see the faces<br> of those of you...<br> who would eliminate the possibility<br> of greatness in American leadership...<br> because of half-truths,<br> lies and innuendoes.<br> I will not be deterred<br> by partisanship.<br> I will not be deterred<br> by misogyny.<br> I will not be deterred<br> by hate.<br> You have now come face-to-face<br> with my will.<br> Confirm my nominee,<br> heal this nation...<br> and let the American people<br> explode into this new millennium...<br> with the exhilaration of being true<br> to the glory of this democracy.<br> Thank you.<br> How's that for a swan song?<br> You're back, Laine.<br> Yeah, I know.<br>
