Hey!<br> You know something, Harry?<br> every telephone call...<br> made by the<br> presidential nominee...<br> of a major political party.<br> I don't want to say which party.<br> Everywhere he went,<br> that's where I was.<br> Coast to coast, I was listening.<br> I'm not saying I elected...<br> the president of<br> the United States...<br> but you can draw<br> your own conclusions.<br> I mean, he lost.<br> Harry, tell them<br> about the time...<br> you put the bug<br> in the parakeet.<br> Parakeet?<br> No kidding.<br> Harry one time actually<br> put a microphone...<br> in a little parakeet.<br> Is that right?<br> Parakeets don't happen<br> to be my thing...<br> but I sure would<br> like to know...<br> how you did<br> the teamster local back in '68.<br> What was that?<br> Don't you get papers<br> in Chicago, Millard?<br> Probably out on strike.<br> It was all over the front pages.<br> Harry was working<br> for the attorney general.<br> You didn't know I knew, did you?<br> The president of<br> this teamster local...<br> set up a phoney welfare fund.<br> I mean, you correct me<br> on the details, Harry.<br> I may be a little fuzzy.<br> Only two people seemed to know...<br> the president and his accountant.<br> They only talked about it<br> on fishing trips.<br> On a private boat...<br> That was the only place<br> they talked details.<br> That boat was bug-proof.<br> That's a fact.<br> They wouldn't strike up<br> a conversation...<br> if there was another boat<br> on the horizon.<br> That didn't stop Harry, did it?<br> No, he recorded everything.<br> Nobody knows<br> how you did it though.<br> Caused a hell of a scandal.<br> Why?<br> No reason.<br> Three people were murdered.<br> Harry's a bit too modest<br> to tell us how he did it.<br> It had nothing to do with me.<br> I just turned in the tapes.<br> The president thought<br> the accountant talked.<br> Nobody really knows for sure.<br> Three days later...<br> they found the accountant,<br> his wife, and kid...<br> naked and tied up in the house...<br> Hands and feet<br> tied up with rope...<br> all the hair on their bodies<br> shaved off.<br> The heads were found<br> in different places.<br> They killed them?<br> No. They gift-wrapped them.<br> This is ancient history now.<br> Harry, how'd you do it?<br> What they do with the tapes<br> is their business.<br> Next thing I knew,<br> you moved out of New York.<br> It had nothing to do with me.<br> Come on, show and tell.<br> How'd you do it?<br> For God's sake, tell him.<br> Turn it off, Stan.<br> What for?<br> Stan, turn it off.<br> They ought to hear this.<br> It's the best thing<br> you've ever done.<br> What was that, Stan?<br> Well, it's the assignment<br> that Harry did this week.<br> It'll make history.<br> Yeah?<br> There's no moment between<br> human beings that I cannot record...<br> and there's no method<br> that I cannot figure out.<br> I could figure out<br> any of Harry's schemes, right?<br> Come on, come on. Try me.<br> Let me give him<br> the assignment, Harry.<br> Yeah.<br> This is a quad<br> in the centre of the city.<br> These are steps,<br> benches all around.<br> It's 12:00 noon...<br> which means<br> that it's lunchtime...<br> for the people working<br> in these offices.<br> They're walking, talking,<br> having lunch...<br> and it's crowded.<br> Naturally. Come on, Stan.<br> Okay. Two people are constantly<br> moving in circles...<br> in and out of the crowd.<br> We don't know whether<br> they'll sit down or what.<br> They're convinced<br> they can't be recorded...<br> because they're in a crowd<br> and constantly moving.<br> Yet, they're the target.<br> The assignment is<br> to get everything they say.<br> How would you do it?<br> One system won't do it.<br> I could've told you that.<br> Why didn't you?<br> Go on, figure it out.<br> You get to their clothes first.<br> You pre-rig their clothes.<br> There's no way of telling...<br> what they're<br> going to be wearing.<br> Get somebody to bump into them.<br> Get a drunk to plant<br> a pin mike on them.<br> They've been bugged before.<br> It's too risky.<br> I got it.<br> You hire a lip-reader<br> with binoculars.<br> No. The client wants<br> their actual voice.<br> Why?<br> So he can believe it.<br> All right. I'll figure it out.<br> I don't know.<br> It must've been an expensive show.<br> Who was so interested?<br> Yeah, was it us?<br> Who's us?<br> Federal government.<br> Private party.<br> It would take<br> at least four passes.<br> I did it in three.<br> Three?

Sounds very pretty.<br> I'd like to take<br> a look at that mike, too.<br> There it is.<br> Oh.<br> I always said<br> we should be partners, Harry.<br> You're the best, but you<br> and me together, that'd be tops.<br> I need a quick look at<br> your plans and devices.<br> I got all the<br> manufacturing plants.<br> We could make a fortune<br> selling to Uncle Sam.<br> Did you hear about<br> the fag wiretapper...<br> who could only tap<br> a Princess phone?<br> No.<br> Made that up yourself, huh?<br> It's pretty funny.<br> Can I cut in?<br> He's got a hell<br> of a sense of humour.<br> I'm talking about<br> making millions...<br> he's making with the jokes.<br> Come on!<br> Thanks a lot.<br> What do you say, Harry?<br> How about going<br> into a partnership?<br> I could use a partner,<br> so could you.<br> I don't need anyone.<br> That's all right.<br> I do pretty good<br> on my own, anyway.<br> You got to give credit<br> where credit's due, right?<br> Abracadabra, Harry.<br> See, I'm number two, Harry.<br> I have to try harder.<br> Would you, um...<br> If you were a girl...<br> who'd waited for someone...<br> You can trust me.<br> Harry, that's you and me<br> when we were out there.<br> What? No shit. Ha ha ha.<br> It's the Moran Super P-7<br> pen mike and transmitter.<br> That's terrific!<br> The bugger got bugged, huh?<br> He got you, Harry.<br> And if you loved him<br> and were patient with him...<br> and even though<br> he didn't dare ever...<br> tell you anything about<br> himself personally...<br> Hey, touch, Harry.<br> That's wild.<br> When did you do that?<br> How do you like it?<br> What do you think?<br> Would you...<br> Would you go back to him?<br> I think you better<br> turn it off and get out.<br> Are you kidding? It's just<br> a joke, for Christ's sakes.<br> Bernie, Harry don't like you<br> to say "Christ's sakes."<br> Well, I'm sorry, Harry.<br> Are you crazy, too, Stanley?<br> What's wrong?<br> Let's have a party here.<br> Paul, it's getting late.<br> Come on, take it easy.<br> Come on.<br> Hey, Millard.<br> Know what these things cost?<br> This cost 1.500 beans.<br> On the house, from me to you.<br> Very nice to meet you.<br> It's only a joke.<br> Meredith?<br> He's got no sense of humour.<br> No. I'm going to stay here.<br> Paul!<br> Okay.<br> I forgot my bag.<br> Harry, I'm really sorry.<br> I didn't mean anything.<br> Come on, Stan.<br> See you Monday, Harry.<br> You want us to<br> put the lights out?<br> Night, Harry!<br> Yeah. Goodnight, Harry.<br> What do you think?<br> I don't know what<br> I'm going to get him...<br> for Christmas yet.<br> He's already got everything.<br> Harry, are you going to give me<br> a hard time tonight?<br> # When the red,<br> red robin #<br> Harry!<br> Harry!<br> Come on.
