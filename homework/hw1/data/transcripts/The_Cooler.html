How are you?<br> You should have called ahead.<br> I would have sent the car.<br> No, we figured<br> we'd surprise you.<br> Anytime, Nicky, anytime.<br> I know that, partner.<br> Shelly, let me<br> introduce you to our...<br> brightest VP here.<br> This is Larry Sokolov.<br> His numbers guy,<br> Marty Goldfarb.<br> How do you do, Shelly?<br> Can I get you<br> something to drink?<br> I'd love a vodka tonic,<br> thanks.<br> ...comes out of the<br> confessional and she...<br> says, 'Move over,<br> I have to gargle.'<br> So Nicky,<br> what brings you to town?<br> Shelly, I've got<br> a smart kid here.<br> He's got some good ideas...<br> about how to revitalize<br> the Shangri-La.<br> Revitalize?

Huh?<br> Forget about your tonsils.<br> When the muff confetti<br> stops coming,<br> that's when you know<br> you got trouble.<br> Did you get a receipt?<br> Excuse me?<br> - They're on sale in the lobby.<br> Charlayne's. This is<br> 'Victoria's Secret<br> Valentine Collection.'<br> What about that broad<br> you got coming here later?<br> How much did she set<br> you back? Nothing...<br> but the best for<br> old Buddy, right?<br> Are you fucking kidding me?<br> Gimme, you don't deserve this.<br> You got all those<br> ladies going home...<br> with a nice breeze<br> between their legs,<br> 'cause you do it<br> the way they like it...<br> and you're saying I'm some<br> Buddy Stafford<br> ego pimp, huh?<br> Hey, fuck you<br> and-- fuck you.<br> Come on, give it to me.<br> Give it to me, man.<br> Come on, come on!<br> Come on, don't be a prick.<br> Come on, man.<br> Come on, give it to me!<br> Come on, man.<br> Oh, fuck! Fuck!<br> Do you ever watch<br> any of those nature shows?<br> What?<br> You know, those<br> nature shows.<br> You watch them?<br> Yeah, I've seen<br> a few nature shows.<br> Yeah? Well, this one I've seen<br> about a dozen times.<br> It's about... lions.<br> It's about...<br> the cycle of life of the lions...<br> and the leader of the pack.<br> 'Pride'. With lions it's a pride.<br> - Yeah.<br> This old king lion, right?<br> He's getting on in years...<br> and then sooner or later...<br> some young male<br> comes along.<br> He challenges him...<br> and he beats...<br> the fuck out of this<br> old lion, right?<br> He just kicks the<br> shit out of him.<br> And then... then they push him<br> out of the pride...<br> and he has to go in the jungle...<br> and scavenge and<br> he dies alone.<br> The nature's got<br> some sense of humor, huh?<br> No shit.<br> See, but Shelly,<br> it's tragic because...<br> he's past it,<br> this old fucked lion...<br> and he doesn't know it...<br> and it would be so<br> much easier for him,<br> if he could just...<br> walk away.<br> And... he could<br> avoid all the pain...<br> and the humiliation.<br> Hey...<br> that would be like accepting...<br> that you were dead<br> already, right?<br> I think I like it better<br> nature's way, don't you?<br> Yeah, maybe you're right.<br> Yeah, that's it.<br> Buy you a drink?<br> Yeah.<br> Shelly, you got a minute?<br> Shelly, this is<br> Johnny Cappella.<br> How you doing, Shelly?<br> I know you from<br> some place, right?<br> Johnny's been opening<br> for Danny Ganz at the Mirage.<br> Now Sony is talking<br> about signing him...<br> to a three-album deal.<br> They're going to position him<br> as the new Harry Connick.<br> And I should be<br> interested in this... why?<br> Johnny's looking to headline.<br> I thought we might<br> be interested.<br> We?<br> - Did I come at a bad time?<br> Even if I was interested,<br> I got fresh ink with Buddy<br> for the next five years.<br> I just renegotiated his contract.<br> Listen, you two need to be<br> on the same page.<br> Larry, listen, if I don't<br> hear from you by Thursday,<br> I'm taking the Stardust.<br> All right? I'm going there.<br> I understand.<br> - Johnny Cappella, gone.<br> We'll definitely be<br> in touch, Johnny.<br> Assholes.<br> Your progressed<br> Venus is in Gemini...<br> and it's in direct motion,<br> which means...<br> ...you're a slow starter<br> when it comes to romance.<br> Sorry. You know what?<br> This is real<br> unprofessional of me.<br> I shouldn't discuss your chart<br> with you until I'm all done.<br> I can tell by the<br> look on your face...<br> you think this is all a lot of B.S.<br> No, I just... I know what<br> the outcome's gonna be.<br> There's not like one<br> particular outcome.<br> A lot of things come<br> into the picture, like...<br> the planets, the moon phases--<br> The outcome won't<br> change with me.<br> It'll be all bad.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> I have never met anyone...<br> who was so down<br> on themselves.<br> Do you know<br> what I do at the Shangri-La?<br> I asked around.<br> You're a cooler.<br> You turn winners into losers.<br> - Do you know how I do that?<br> Listen, I know there's<br> a lot of stuff...<br> that happens in<br> casinos all the time.<br> I do it by being myself.<br> People get next to<br> me, their luck turns.<br> It's always been that way.<br> Well, that sounds...<br> like a self-fulfilling<br> prophecy to me.<br> There's a whole chapter<br> of that in my book...<br> I only got six more days.<br> Well... really almost five.<br> I'm leaving town.<br> Only five more days?<br> Then we shouldn't waste<br> any more time.<br> You want to go back<br> to your place?<br> If this is--<br> I'm not sure...<br> I'm not sure I can afford...<br> I can't afford to--<br> - Christ.<br> Oh, God.
