                        Hey, Watty!<br> Stop!<br> What do you think of Wales?<br> - Gorgeous, isn't it?<br> - Very hilly.<br> It's very bumpy.<br> Goodbye.<br> Meet you at the house.<br> Anybody at home?<br> Good day, sir.<br> - Anyone home?<br> - Squire.<br> Oh, delicious lady, delicious surprise.<br> How are you, Jones?<br> Making the most of your half-day.<br> - Good afternoon, sir.<br> - Squat, man.<br> - No ceremony with me.<br> - I'll just get these out of sight.<br> Any sign of the new inhabitant?<br> Any moment now, I think,<br> if the train from London was on time.<br> And why, dear lady, did I not see you<br> at the Travazelis wedding?<br> Naughty man.<br> I sat with you at the breakfast.<br> Mr. Jones.<br> - Colonel?<br> - Colonel Moffat.<br> We must welcome him properly.<br> What is this? Is he married?<br> With children?<br> No mention of it in his letters.<br> - Do you speak English?<br> - I do.<br> Well, be a dear and hold that.<br> - Why don't you say something?<br> - Never speak till I'm spoken to.<br> - Who was that?<br> - My mommy. Never had no daddy.<br> It's heavy.<br> Give us a hand.<br> Oh, heavy.<br> Full of books, I shouldn't be surprised.<br> Don't stand there gawking.<br> Come on, give us a hand with the luggage.<br> Tallyho, I thought we'd lost you.<br> - Oh, dear. Good afternoon.<br> - Kitchen through here?<br> And garden through here.<br> Has anybody got a sweetie?<br> No.<br> Lovely.<br> Bigger than I expected.<br> So this is my house.<br> No, it isn't.<br> Well...<br> Isn't this Pengarth house?<br> The name of the building, I mean.<br> - Yes, it is.<br> - And it isn't yours, damn it.<br> - Belongs to this...<br> - Moffat.<br> Yes. Yes, it was left me by my uncle,<br> Dr. Moffat. I'm Miss Moffat.<br> And you must be Miss Ronberry,<br> who so kindly corresponded with me.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Do sit down.<br> But those letters were written by a man.<br> Well, if they were, I've been grossly<br> deceiving myself for all these years.<br> Surely you signed your name very oddly.<br> My initials, L.C. Moffat.<br> You see, I never felt that Lily Christobel<br> really suited me.<br> L.C.<br> I thought it meant lieutenant colonel.<br> Yes, but there was a military title<br> afterwards.<br> M.A., Master of Arts.<br> A female Master of Arts?<br> Any objections?<br> How long is this going to last?<br> Quite a long time, I hope...<br> ...considering that we've been waiting<br> for it for 2000 years.<br> Are you saved?<br> Are you saved?<br> - Am I what?<br> - Are you high or low?<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> - Church or chapel?<br> I really don't know. Low, I suppose.<br> And now you know all about me.<br> What do you do?<br> I'm afraid I don't do anything.<br> Good heavens. Nothing at all?<br> What a waste.<br> - Well, I mean to say...<br> - Mr. Treverby owns the hall.<br> Interesting. I never had much to do<br> with landed gentry.<br> If I may say so, dear lady,<br> that is patently obvious...<br> ...and I will not intrude<br> on you any longer.<br> Right, sir. Turn, sir. Out, sir. March.<br> - Good day, Jones.<br> - Good day, sir.<br> Nobody could say<br> that I've made a conquest there.<br> What's the matter with him?<br> - Oh, he's really very nice.<br> - When you get to know him?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm afraid I'll never have the time.<br> I do thank both of you.<br> You've arranged everything<br> quite splendidly.<br> I like this house. May I look about?<br> Oh, yes, of course.<br> Dear, where's his lordship?<br> Took offense and left.<br> - At her?<br> - I'm afraid so.<br> Ain't she a clinker?<br> She is unusual.<br> She's a clinker, that's what.<br> Terrible strong-willed though.<br> Would bring me here.<br> I said, "No," I said.<br> - "Not with my past," I said.<br> - Your past?<br> Yes, before she took me up.<br> But now, what with her...<br> And since I've joined the corps.<br> - The corps?<br> - Yes.<br> The Militant and Righteous Corps.<br> Singing and praying<br> and collecting full blast.<br> I've been a different woman ever since.<br> - Are you saved?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> So am I. Ain't it lovely?<br> But what was your past?<br> Light fingers.<br> Light?<br> Fingers.<br> Terrible. It was everything:<br> Pennies, brooches, spoons, tiddly.<br> Every time there was a do,<br> everything went.<br> And I always knew it was me.<br> - Kitchen all right?<br> - Ain't seen no mice yet.<br> - I'm going outside.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> Come look at this.<br> Come out here a minute.<br> This barn out here.<br> - Is it mine, by any chance?<br> - No chance.<br> It belongs to the Gwalia farm,<br> but the farm burned down.<br> Sir Herbert Vesey owns it.<br> He lives in London.<br> Then it's available.<br> I mean, it could be bought or rented.<br> I suppose so.<br> We'll find out, we'll write him a letter.<br> - Can we get in?<br> - Only too easily.<br> But you haven't come down<br> to farm, have you?<br> Hardly.<br> Perfect.<br> Perfectly awful, the smell.<br> I like the smell of cow dung.<br> Don't you, Mr. Jones?<br> I don't think I ever thought about it.<br> - Room for 30 desks here, blackboard there.<br> - Desks?<br> - Cloakroom, office.<br> - Office?<br> We haven't properly met.<br> John Goronwy Jones, isn't it?<br> Goronwy.<br> - Goronwy.<br> - Yeah.<br> You've had a grammar-school education.<br> You work as a clerk in a law firm<br> and you're not happy in your work.<br> How much do they pay you?<br> Why, 33 shillings a week.<br> - I'll give you 34 and your lunch.<br> - You will?<br> Yes, I will.<br> I don't expect to pay you anything.<br> You've had a fair education,<br> you live alone in a large house...<br> ...and have a quite ample annuity.<br> - I will give you lunch, naturally.<br> - Give me lunch?<br> Well, you can't pretend your life is so full<br> that you have no time for a worthy cause.<br> Well, not completely full<br> at the moment, perhaps.<br> But when the right gentleman<br> comes along...<br> If you're a spinster well on in her 30s,<br> he's lost his way and he isn't coming.<br> Why don't you face the facts<br> and enjoy life, same as I do?<br> You mean you've given up hope?<br> Oh, what a horrid expression.<br> I don't recall that I ever had any hope.<br> How very odd.<br> What's that singing?<br> Men, boys, coming from the mine.<br> They burst into song at the slightest<br> provocation. You mustn't take any notice.<br> On the contrary, I expect<br> to take the keenest possible notice.<br> How many families live around here?<br> - Families?<br> - I mean, within a radius of five miles.<br> Well, there's the squire, of course.<br> - Mrs. Rempryce in the castle out at...<br> - No, no, I mean ordinary families.<br> - The villagers?<br> - Yes, how many families?<br> - Really haven't the faintest idea.<br> - About 20 families in the village.<br> And 15 in the farms around.<br> - Many children?<br> - What age?<br> Up to 16 or 17.<br> Here, they are only children<br> until they are 12...<br> ...then they're sent into the mine.<br> And after one week, they are old men.<br> And all for a few pennies.<br> - What did he say?<br> - Never mind.<br> How many can read or write?<br> - Next to none.<br> - Why do you ask?<br> Because she is going to start a school.<br> Perceptive of you, Mr. Jones.<br> For the ordinary children, you mean?<br> Yes, my dear, for the ordinary children...<br> ...who came into the world<br> by the same process exactly as you and I.<br> A school for them? What for?<br> To teach them to read, teach them to write.<br> The old, the young...<br> But who will teach them?<br> - Me.<br> - You?<br> - And you.<br> - Oh, no.<br> And you.<br> My goodness, miss, I don't care<br> if you're not church or chapel, I'm with you.<br> Well, I couldn't teach those children,<br> they smell.<br> If we'd never been taught<br> to wash, so would we.<br> We'll put them under the pump. Well?<br> Well, I can do addition and subtraction.<br> - But I cannot do multiplication.<br> - We'll work on it.<br> The best thing about teaching<br> is you're learning all the time, you'll see.<br> Here we are,<br> three stolid, middle-aged folk...<br> ...and there are those infant creatures<br> hardly out of their shells...<br> ...when they're pushed back<br> under the ground.<br> Under the ground physically, and what<br> is worse, under the ground mentally.<br> Why? Because they were silly enough<br> to be born penniless.<br> They'll never have a chance unless...<br> We have the blessed opportunity to raise up<br> the children from the bowels of the earth...<br> ...where the devil hath imprisoned them<br> in powers of darkness...<br> ...bringing them to the light<br> of knowledge.<br> Well, that's one way<br> of putting it, Mr. Jones.<br> Now, the letter about the barn.<br> Come on. We'll have some tea.<br> We have to compose a letter...<br> ...that will make Sir Herbert Vesey<br> want to give us the barn.<br> Our tea, Watty!<br> Just one room.<br> All I need is one big schoolroom.<br> A floor, a stove, a few windows...<br> ...like this, as simple as can be. No frills.<br> That's good, boys.<br> Now, then, underneath the pump,<br> all hands.<br> That's good, boys.<br> That's it.<br> Now, then, let me have a look.<br> Show me your hands, everybody.<br> - Cat.<br> - Cat.<br> Good.<br> - Miss Ronberry?<br> - Rat.<br> Rat.<br> Dog.<br> Dog.<br> Dog.<br> Please, Miss Ronberry,<br> how do you spell it?<br> - What, dear?<br> - Curriculum.<br> Yes. Now, what would you like?<br> The Rivers of Europe<br> or King Alfred and the Cake?<br> - Goodbye, Madaly.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Ta-ta, Bladwin.<br> You here again?<br> - No, I said, are you here again?<br> - No, miss.<br> - What do you mean, "No, miss"?<br> - We isn't here again, miss.<br> Well, what are you, then?<br> - We isn't this same lot as this morning.<br> - Ain't you?<br> Miss Ronnyberry tell us to wait, miss.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Good evening.<br> I see you and the lady teacher<br> behind the door.<br> Wait till you see Miss Moffat.<br> She will give you what for.<br> Wait till you see Miss Moffat.<br> She will give you what for.<br> You wait till you see Miss Moffat.<br> She will give you what for.<br> Boys, sorry to keep you waiting,<br> I won't be a minute.<br> Yes, why don't you wash your hands<br> by the pump? You'll find the soap.<br> Did you understand that?<br> - Yes, miss.<br> - Thank you, miss.<br> - Good.<br> - Please, miss, can I have a kiss?<br> I beg your pardon?<br> What did you say?<br> Please, miss, can I have a kiss?<br> Of course you can.<br> - Anyone else?<br> - Please, miss, can I have a broken jaw?<br> I heard a dreadful noise. What happened?<br> That, I'm not quite sure.<br> - Did they attack you?<br> - No, no, I'm afraid that I attacked them.<br> Oh, dear, our poor school.<br> The mine owners don't want us,<br> the pub owners don't want us...<br> ...the chapel is suspicious,<br> and now I've attacked the youth.<br> What are these? Books.<br> They must have dropped them.<br> I set them a composition.<br> "How I Would Spend My Holiday."<br> The ones who write English.<br> Their holiday?<br> Did they know what you meant?<br> You know, I had a...<br> Good morning. Good morning, children.<br> - Good morning. And you too.<br> - Sorry.<br> Peasant slut.<br> You'll have to hurry, Mr. Jones. We're going<br> to see the squire about the barn.<br> We'll catch him leaving the pub, I hope.<br> - Good luck!<br> - We'll need it.<br> Hurry, hurry, fast as you can.<br> Stop. Let me out.<br> - Hello, lady.<br> - Good morning.<br> I was just going to drive up the hill<br> to see you. May we have a little contact?<br> We may, we may indeed.<br> - I will wait for you at the post office.<br> - Thank you.<br> Well?<br> Yes, I have a very important message<br> for you by word of mouth from a gent...<br> ...who's staying at my place<br> this weekend.<br> Sir Herbert Vesey. You know that name?<br> Yes. He's the owner<br> of the Gwalia farm next to me.<br> And more to the point,<br> he's the owner of the barn.<br> Yes, go on.<br> Sir Herbert has definitely decided<br> he has no use for the old wreck.<br> Yes, I know that already.<br> But what you don't know,<br> as he's only just now confided in me...<br> ...is that he does not see it as a school...<br> ...and under no circumstances<br> will he let it as such.<br> To which end, you will receive<br> official notice in tomorrow's post...<br> ...with profound regret,<br> yours faithfully, et cetera.<br> But he implied in his first letter<br> that he was willing to sell.<br> Well, then, some bigwig must've<br> made him change his mind, mustn't he?<br> You.<br> I'm not gonna have any<br> of this damned hanky-panky in my village.<br> - Your village?<br> - Yes, my village.<br> - My mine.<br> - Your mine?<br> Half share of it.<br> That explains a good deal.<br> Now, just a minute.<br> I do my level best for the villagers.<br> They call me squire.<br> It's a term of affection, you know.<br> It's jolly touching.<br> I mean, a hamper of food every Christmas?<br> The whole shoot.<br> They jabber away in that funny lingo,<br> but bless their hearts, it's a free country.<br> But giving them ideas,<br> trying to turn them into gentlemen...<br> ...what is the point, my dear madam?<br> Stop calling me your dear madam.<br> I'm not married, I am not French...<br> ...and you haven't<br> the slightest affection for me.<br> Right on every account.<br> Well, my dear lady, anything I can do<br> to make your stay here more pleasant.<br> Just a minute.<br> I know I shall be sticking a pin into a whale,<br> but here are two words about yourself.<br> You are the squire bountiful, are you?<br> Adored by his contented subjects...<br> ...intelligent and benignly understanding,<br> are you?<br> I should just like to point out that there<br> is a considerable amount of dirt...<br> ...ignorance, misery<br> and discontent in this world...<br> ...and that a good deal of it<br> is due to people like you...<br> ...because you're a stupid, conceited,<br> greedy, good-for-nothing...<br> ...addle-pated nincompoop.<br> And you can go to blue blazes.<br> I perceive you have been drinking.<br> That was undignified,<br> but I feel the better for it.<br> Good day, sir.<br> And good day, madam.<br> How can he be so mean?<br> It's so frustrating.<br> - That barn isn't even being used.<br> - Cheer up.<br> I can't cheer up,<br> the whole school is at stake.<br> I'm gonna turn that barn into a schoolroom<br> if I have to die doing it.<br> Look, miss.<br> I got you a present, see?<br> It's got a rope and everything.<br> We'll hang it on that tree over there.<br> I'll get those boys to help.<br> Morgan, Robbart.<br> Cheer up.<br> It will be nice to have a bell.<br> Oh, come on, boys.<br> It's a mess, and he won't budge,<br> the big fat fool.<br> It's so unlike the squire,<br> I can't believe it.<br> Oh, it's a mess, and I was so sure.<br> Men do know best, I think.<br> Then don't think.<br> No, I know I shouldn't.<br> - Hand me your handkerchief.<br> - Why?<br> I want to blow my nose.<br> Why don't you have a good cry?<br> Am I needed or am I just being stubborn?<br> Should I just give up and get out?<br> No, you're tired,<br> you haven't stopped for weeks. It will...<br> Here, look at these.<br> They're so funny, listen.<br> "If I has ever holiday, I has breakfast<br> and talks, then dinner and a rest...<br> ...tea, then nothing, then supper,<br> then I talks, and I go sleep."<br> From exhaustion, I suppose.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Just another walk.<br> What's the matter, little dear?<br> - Mom's hit me.<br> - Naughty Mom. Why?<br> Just because I told her she was common.<br> That child's unhappy.<br> Everyone's unhappy. You have to fight it.<br> Look at this.<br> I never wore bloomers in my life.<br> "Holiday time, that carefree, magic word.<br> What shall I do this year?<br> Tobogganing among the eternal snows<br> or bathing in the sunny south of France."<br> That's beautiful.<br> I might think so too if I hadn't read it<br> in the travel pamphlet...<br> ...that was opened on this desk.<br> Oh, you mustn't.<br> Listen to this, listen.<br> "The mine is dark.<br> If a light come in the mine,<br> the rivers in the mine will run fast...<br> ...with the voice of many women.<br> The walls will fall in<br> and it will be the end of the world..."<br> The bell is up, miss.<br> Thank you, thank you.<br> "So the mine is dark.<br> But when I walk through<br> the tan-something shaft in the dark...<br> ...I can touch with my hands<br> the leaves on the trees...<br> ...and underneath,<br> where the corn is green.<br> There is a wind in the shaft.<br> Not carbon monoxide they talk about,<br> it smell like the sea...<br> ...only, like, as..."<br> I can't read it. "As if... As if..."<br> As if the sea had fresh flowers<br> lying about.<br> "As if the sea had fresh flowers<br> lying about."<br> And that is my holiday.<br> Are you Morgan Evans?<br> Yes, miss.<br> Did you write this?<br> No, miss.<br> But it's in your book.<br> - Yes, miss.<br> - Then who wrote it?<br> I don't know, miss.<br> Come inside.<br> Come in.<br> Did you write this?<br> I don't know, miss.<br> What is the matter with it?<br> Sit down. Take your cap off.<br> Spelling was deplorable, of course.<br> Leaves, "L-A-F-S."<br> - What was it by rights?<br> - A V, to start with.<br> I never heard of no V's, miss.<br> Don't call me miss.<br> - Are you not a miss?<br> - Yes, I am, but it's not polite.<br> You say, "Yes, Miss Moffat,"<br> or, "No, Miss Moffat."<br> M-O-double-F-A-T.<br> - No V's?<br> - No V's.<br> Where do you live?<br> Llyn-y-Mwyn, Miss Moffat,<br> four miles from here.<br> How big is it?<br> Four houses and a beerhouse.<br> Have you any hobbies?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - What?<br> Rum.<br> Rum?<br> Do you live with your parents?<br> No, by me own self.<br> Me mother is dead,<br> my father and four big brothers...<br> ...was in the mine-shaft accident<br> when I was 10.<br> - Killed?<br> - Oh, yes, everybody was.<br> What sort of man was your father?<br> He was a mongrel.<br> A what?<br> He had a dash of English.<br> He learned it to me.<br> Do you go to chapel?<br> No, thank you.<br> Who taught you to read and write?<br> - Taught?<br> - Taught.<br> The verb, to teach.<br> Oh, teached?<br> Who taught you?<br> - I did.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What books have you read?<br> Books? Bit of the Bible<br> and a book a fella stole for me.<br> - What?<br> - The Ladies' Companion.<br> - Can I go now, please?<br> - No, no.<br> Would you like to learn any more?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Why not?<br> The other men would have a good laugh.<br> I see.<br> Have you ever written anything<br> before this exercise?<br> - No.<br> - Why not?<br> Nobody never asked me to before.<br> What is the matter with it?<br> Nothing's the matter with it.<br> Whether it means anything<br> is too early for me to say.<br> But it shows exceptional talent<br> for a boy in your circumstances.<br> Terrible long words, Miss Moffat.<br> This shows that you are very clever.<br> Has anyone ever said that to you before?<br> It is news to me.<br> What effect does the news have on you?<br> It is a bit sudden. Except it makes me...<br> Yes?<br> I want to get more clever still.<br> I wanna know<br> what is behind of all them books.<br> Can you be here tomorrow?<br> Tomorrow I am working<br> on the 6 till 4 shift.<br> I see. Then can you be here at 5?<br> Five? Not before 6,<br> there's five miles to walk.<br> Yes, 7, then. Of course.<br> In the meantime,<br> I'll correct this for spelling and grammar.<br> Yes, Miss Moffat.<br> Well, that will be all. Good night.<br> Good night, Miss Moffat.<br> "When I walk through<br> the tan-something shaft in the dark...<br> ...I can touch with my hands<br> the leaves on the trees...<br> ...and underneath,<br> where the corn is green."<br> That's right, more cleverness.<br> Ring that bell.<br> The hell with the barn.<br> Now, the history of Syracuse. Morgan?<br> Founded 734 B.C.<br> By colonists from Corinth.<br> Became leading city of Sicily.<br> Seized by Gelon, the tyrant of Gela,<br> in 485 B.C.<br> No, no, no.<br> Listen carefully.<br> Be not afeard.<br> The isle is full of noises...<br> ...sounds and sweet airs<br> that give delight and hurt not.<br> Sometimes, a thousand<br> twangling instruments...<br> ...will hum about mine ears,<br> and then...<br> ...sometimes, voices...<br> ...that, if I then had waked after long sleep,<br> will make me sleep again...<br> ...and then in dreaming,<br> the clouds methought would open...<br> ...and show riches<br> Ready to drop upon me...<br> ...that when I waked,<br> I cried to dream again.<br> Bravo.<br> Now...<br> Oh, please, could you help me? It says<br> in this book that seven eight's a 56.<br> And eight seven's a 56.<br> I can't understand that at all.<br> - Now, look here. Take this number and...<br> - Listen to this.<br> "The 18th century was a cauldron.<br> Vice and elegance boiled to a simmer...<br> ...until the kitchen of society<br> reeked fulminously...<br> ...and the smell percolated<br> to the marble halls above."<br> Signed, Morgan Evans.<br> So expressive. So...<br> - Do you know what he means?<br> - No. Neither does he.<br> - But he's reaching all those lovely words.<br> - It's wonderful.<br> My plans are laid around here.<br> - What plans?<br> - Not yet.<br> And to think that a year ago,<br> he hardly knew no English.<br> And now he knows too much.<br> Stuck-up teacher's pet.<br> Well done.<br> Did either of you ever believe that<br> our school would live to be 2 years old?<br> - It's wonderful.<br> - Indeed, it's a miracle.<br> - Guess what.<br> - What?<br> - I'm a sergeant major.<br> - You're not.<br> Remember Sergeant Major Hopkins<br> deserting and marrying a sailor?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - Well, she's dead, poor soul, and I'm in.<br> But we had a fine service for her.<br> We saved three sinners.<br> And the collection.<br> I ain't seen so much "oof,"<br> not since the great Liverpool exposition.<br> But they didn't make a collection<br> at the Liverpool exhibition.<br> No, but I did.<br> - You must be feeling better, Bessie.<br> - No, Miss Ronberry.<br> It's all this sitting down.<br> It's been going on two years now.<br> I hear tell it ends<br> in everything rotting away.<br> - What's rotting away?<br> - What's the matter, little dear?<br> I believe all these lessons<br> is bad for me insides.<br> I feel quite faint sometimes,<br> as if me heart had stopped.<br> It feels like the end of the world.<br> Oh, come on, Bessie Watty,<br> what is this dying doubt business?<br> Everybody's against me!<br> I'm gonna throw myself off a cliff<br> and kill myself.<br> It'll make a nice case in the papers,<br> me in pieces at the bottom of a cliff!<br> I'm going mad, mad,<br> and I'm gonna kill myself...<br> ...and nothing's gonna stop me!<br> Stone dead at the bottom of a cliff!<br> Oh, I've made a mess of your rug, ma'am,<br> but it was worth it.<br> There's bad blood in this girl,<br> you mark my word.<br> Well, she'll catch her death.<br> There's nothing better than a drop<br> of cold water, ma'am.<br> I found that out with her father,<br> he was foreign.<br> Better now, eh?<br> I can't remember nothing.<br> I'm in a coma.<br> She's one of my failures, I'm afraid.<br> - Fish out of water, guttersnipe species.<br> - Oh, she's young.<br> She's young.<br> Watty's talked about sending her away<br> into service. I suppose that's best.<br> Has anyone seen my copy<br> of Meditations?<br> I don't see how Morgan<br> can manage 10 hours in the pit.<br> And Marcus Aurelius on top<br> of all the other stuff you've set for him.<br> I don't... Oh, for heaven's sake,<br> where was it now?<br> I don't see how he can.<br> I thought... He's incredible.<br> He left the mine on Friday.<br> - Finished?<br> - Permanently.<br> He's agreed to accept a loan.<br> Have you looked at the accounts?<br> I'm afraid we'll have to sell out<br> a couple more of Uncle Robert's shares.<br> Forgive me if I start to cram.<br> "From my Grandfather Verus,<br> I learned good morals...<br> ...and the management of my temper.<br> From my father, and my memory of him...<br> ...modesty and manliness."<br> "From my mother..."<br> - Piety.<br> - "Piety."<br> "From my mother, piety and..."<br> - Giving?<br> - "Generosity" would be a better choice.<br> Generosity.<br> "Generosity and abstinence,<br> not only from wicked deeds...<br> ...but from wicked thoughts.<br> - And what is more..."<br> - Furthermore.<br> "And furthermore,<br> from my great-grandfather...<br> ...not to go to public schools,<br> but to have a good teacher at home."<br> Continue.<br> Now, you must memorize this, Morgan.<br> As given any two,<br> you can always find the third, because A...<br> She has some wonderful plans for him,<br> I can tell by her manner. It's so exciting.<br> I think she's riding for a fall.<br> - Bessie, why?<br> - All this ordering him about.<br> I got me eyes on the lad, if she hasn't.<br> He's getting sick of it. She's got no idea.<br> I got some scent on my hands, Mr. Jones.<br> Would you like to smell them?<br> No, thank you, Bessie.<br> I can smell them from here.<br> Sweetheart<br> The man in the moon<br> I'm going to marry him soon<br> All right, try it again.<br> Good. Don't forget.<br> That's the third one. Remember it.<br> Then read it.<br> Was Duddy...?<br> Can you repeat it?<br> Evans? Evans? Evans?<br> - Are you there, Evans?<br> - Yes, Miss Moffat.<br> What are you mumbling about?<br> Nothing. Nothing at all.<br> Finished?<br> Finally, Miss Moffat.<br> Let me see.<br> You are good, you know?<br> Anything wrong? You tired?<br> No, no, I'm not.<br> Give this a pull, will you?<br> Why not kill two birds with one stone,<br> get Voltaire by heart?<br> If you can even argue a point like that,<br> you'll do. Thank you.<br> Take a bit of a run.<br> It'll clear your head.<br> Then start your essay on<br> The Wealth of Nations.<br> You're buried under books.<br> Oh, you're here, Morgan.<br> Miss Moffat's having a bit of a walk.<br> And I am having a bit of a drink.<br> - I'll go and find her.<br> - I don't wanna see no Miss Moffat.<br> - Morgan, the double negative...<br> - Now, don't you start.<br> I like the double negative,<br> it says what I want the way I like.<br> I've never seen you like this before.<br> Come to think of it,<br> I haven't either, not for two years.<br> And I'm surprised by me self<br> and shocked by me self.<br> Got into one of them public houses<br> and pouring poison rum...<br> ...down me nice, clean teeth.<br> What's come over you, Morgan Evans?<br> Come back here to your little cage.<br> If you wash hands, comb hair<br> and get your grammar right...<br> ...we might give you a nice bit<br> of sewing to do.<br> Bloody Voltaire.<br> Don't you dare use an expression<br> like that to me.<br> I got plenty of others, thank you,<br> and they're all coming out.<br> You're in my road.<br> Move please, Miss Ronnyberry.<br> - Going for a walk, Evans?<br> - Yes, Miss Moffat.<br> - Can you repeat the Voltaire?<br> - Not yet.<br> It's very short.<br> Paper blowed away.<br> Copy it again<br> and bring it to me, will you?<br> Yes, miss.<br> I was just coming out to find you.<br> - Morgan seems...<br> - He's gone for a walk.<br> I do hope he doesn't slow down.<br> Taking on Greek is gonna be a real task.<br> You don't think all this, in his situation,<br> is rather sudden?<br> - I mean...<br> - Oh, no, no, not in his case, touch wood.<br> He has one of the most receptive brains<br> I've ever come across.<br> - Oh, I know his brain's all right, but...<br> - Oh, stop worrying.<br> Tomorrow you're gonna hear some news<br> that will dumbfound you, dumbfound him.<br> - You're going to see the squire?<br> - That's right.<br> - But he was furious with you last time...<br> - That's right.<br> - I'm afraid he might still...<br> - So am I, but I have to risk it.<br> Why?<br> I can only tell you that my plan<br> depends entirely on him.<br> How do I look?<br> Oh, charming.<br> - Is it a favor of the squire?<br> - Yes.<br> - A big favor of the squire?<br> - Yes, big.<br> Then may I suggest that you should borrow<br> Miss Ronberry's hat.<br> - Her hat?<br> - Yes, her hat and we'll keep yours.<br> Miss Ronberry?<br> Yes. Yes, of course.<br> - But it's so fluffy.<br> - That's the whole point.<br> Oh, it all helps.<br> I should feel a perfect fool.<br> - Ready?<br> - Yes, ready.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Wish me luck.<br> The door's open.<br> Good grief.<br> Is anyone here?<br> I say, is anyone at home?<br> This is the one.<br> Right. Up you go there<br> and I'll try and pass it up to you.<br> On the hook properly, is it?<br> Good.<br> Good heavens.<br> Yes?<br> Oh, squire.<br> I was just saying to myself,<br> what a perfectly delightful room.<br> So manly.<br> Just the sort of place you'd expect<br> an addle-pated nincompoop to live in...<br> ...I suppose.<br> Can you ever find it in your heart<br> to forgive me?<br> I know I don't deserve it,<br> but I ask it anyway, as a woman.<br> A poor, foolish woman.<br> You've got a lot of nerve<br> coming here uninvited, I must say.<br> I know, and how good of you,<br> how big of you to receive me.<br> But then, madam,<br> I haven't received you, have I?<br> And I want to tell you to your face<br> that I wouldn't...<br> I won't.<br> You're quite right, of course.<br> I don't deserve it. I should leave at once.<br> I should hope so, if you have<br> any sense of shame.<br> I shall leave at once.<br> - What's the matter? What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> - No, I'm all right.<br> - Would you like a glass of water?<br> No, no, I just... If I might sit here<br> just for a minute. Just for a minute.<br> Probably a touch of the sun.<br> That coupled with all the other problems<br> at the school.<br> I heard you're a spiffing success.<br> Oh, such a lot of obstacles<br> to be overcome.<br> So many times when one longs<br> for the qualities of a man.<br> The courage of a lion, the cunning of a fox,<br> the strength of a bear.<br> Yes, quite so.<br> I see what you mean, but...<br> The skin of a rhinoceros.<br> Beg your pardon?<br> So many things that only the wit...<br> ...and resourcefulness<br> of a man can provide.<br> I'll grant you that, my dear.<br> A woman's way, weak, weak, weak.<br> What is it, my dear, you're suffering?<br> Squire, I must bare my soul to you.<br> I have a problem,<br> a problem with Morgan Evans.<br> Evans?<br> Morgan Evans.<br> - Can't say it rings a bell.<br> - A pupil of mine. A tenant of yours.<br> Well, what's he been up to? A bit<br> of muslin? That little Cockney filly, eh?<br> - Bessie Watty, a schoolgirl?<br> - Don't you forget...<br> ...proximity is the mother of invention.<br> Well, you are so wise.<br> This boy is quite out of the ordinary.<br> Who?<br> - Oh, Morgan Evans.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> I mean he was born<br> with very extraordinary gifts.<br> You don't say.<br> - He should be given every chance to...<br> - To do what?<br> - To write.<br> - To write? What?<br> Well, you see, if he had been born earlier,<br> he would have had a protector.<br> Protector? Against what?<br> I mean, a patron...<br> ...in the sense that Lord Bolingbroke<br> was Pope's.<br> The pope?<br> Alexander Pope, the writer.<br> Yes, well...<br> ...think of Shakespeare.<br> - I will.<br> - He dedicated The Rape of Lucrece...<br> ...to the right honorable<br> earl of Southampton.<br> "Your Honor's in all duty,<br> William Shakespeare."<br> A rape?<br> I'd just as soon not have the family name<br> connected with a rape.<br> Southampton, his name will live forever<br> because of the help that he gave...<br> ...to a poor and helpless writer.<br> I never thought of Shakespeare as poor.<br> Some say his father was a butcher.<br> You see, Southampton realized<br> that the boy had genius.<br> And he fostered it.<br> He...<br> He backed him like a horse.<br> Now, wait, a horse.<br> - A horse.<br> - And you think that...?<br> Now, wait, wait, wait,<br> wait just a minute, just a minute.<br> Why shouldn't I have my writer too?<br> My little pit pony writer, eh?<br> Why not, indeed. But what do you mean?<br> I don't under... Oh, yes, yes.<br> Now I understand.<br> What a wonderful idea.<br> Typical, isn't it?<br> Everyone finally having to scream<br> to you for help.<br> - Scream away, dear lady, scream away.<br> - Well.<br> - There's a scholarship going.<br> - Scholarship to where?<br> - Oxford.<br> - Oxford.<br> A scholarship to Trinity College Oxford.<br> I've got a brother at Oxford.<br> - No.<br> - Yes. I'll write to him.<br> Why not let me compose<br> the recommendations for the boy?<br> Save you the trouble,<br> you have so many problems.<br> - Then we could post it immediately.<br> - I've got a better idea.<br> Why don't we all have dinner together<br> this evening and talk about it then?<br> You and Miss Ronberry,<br> Jones and the boy.<br> What's his name, Pope?<br> Pope.<br> How kind you are.<br> Nothing.<br> I'm glad you came to your senses.<br> Safe home. See you later, 7:30.<br> Thank you so very much, squire.<br> Drive off. For heaven's sake, drive off.<br> Bye-bye.<br> That man is so stupid,<br> it sits on him like a halo.<br> Evans.<br> Are you here?<br> I'm here.<br> Present for you.<br> What is it?<br> Greek book.<br> What do I want with Greek?<br> I'm entering you for a scholarship<br> to Oxford.<br> Oxford?<br> Trinity College Oxford. Get your cap.<br> Wash your hands.<br> We're having dinner with the squire.<br> Don't want no fancy dinner.<br> Don't need any Greek.<br> - Oh, yes, you do.<br> - No good to me in the mine.<br> What did you say?<br> I was born in a Welsh hay field<br> when my mother was helping in the harvest.<br> And I always lived in a small house<br> with no stairs, only a ladder. And no water.<br> And until my brothers were killed,<br> I never sleep except three in a bed.<br> Well, what on earth has three in a bed<br> to do with learning Greek?<br> It has a lot.<br> You can't carry a book of Greek<br> into the Gwesmor Arms.<br> But my dear boy,<br> you don't go to the Gwesmor Arms.<br> Oh, yes, I do.<br> I've been there every afternoon this week<br> and I've been there now...<br> ...and that is why I can speak my mind.<br> Well...<br> I had no idea you felt like this.<br> Because you are not interested in me.<br> Not interested in you?<br> How could you be interested<br> in a bloody machine?<br> You put a penny in and if nothing<br> comes out, you give it a good shake.<br> Evans, Evans, Evans.<br> My name is Morgan Evans,<br> and all my friends call me Morgan.<br> If there's anything that gets on the wrong<br> side of me, it's people calling me Evans.<br> The schoolmistress' little dog.<br> That's what they call me in the village.<br> What's it got to do with you<br> if my hands are dirty?<br> Mind your own business.<br> I...<br> I've spent money on you.<br> I don't mind that.<br> Money is meant to be spent.<br> But time is different.<br> Two years of valuable currency.<br> I've spent two years on you.<br> Ever since that first day, the mainspring<br> of this school has been your career.<br> Sometimes, in the middle of the night...<br> ...when I've been desperately tired,<br> I've lain awake making plans.<br> Large and small.<br> Sensible and silly.<br> Plans for you.<br> And you tell me<br> that I have no interest in you?<br> If I say any more, I shall start to cry,<br> and I haven't cried...<br> ...since I was younger than you are,<br> and I'd never forgive you for that.<br> I'm going to that dinner.<br> I am going out.<br> I don't care for this conversation.<br> Please, never mention it again.<br> If you want to go on,<br> be at school tomorrow.<br> If not, don't.<br> I don't want your money,<br> and I don't want your time.<br> I don't wanna be thankful<br> to no strange woman for anything.<br> Take your foot away from that door.<br> I don't understand you.<br> I don't understand you at all.<br> Sweetheart<br> The man in the moon<br> I'm going to marry him soon<br> It'd fill me with bliss<br> Just to give him one kiss<br> But I know that a dozen<br> I never would miss<br> Mom's gone out, you know.<br> To one of her meetings.<br> The rest has all gone out to dinner.<br> It's funny. We've never been<br> by ourselves before.<br> You don't have to go to Oxford.<br> Clever chap like you.<br> - Talking a lot, aren't I?<br> - Yes.<br> I think she's wicked.<br> - Mind your own business.<br> - I won't, you know.<br> I like to know about everything.<br> I like to do the things I like.<br> I like sweets.<br> Don't care if it does make me fat.<br> It's funny, isn't it?<br> First time we've ever been alone together,<br> just when I'm leaving.<br> - Leaving?<br> - I'll be gone tomorrow.<br> A friend of me mom's<br> has found a place for me...<br> ...at the house<br> she works at in Cheltenham.<br> Will you miss me?<br> I've got some scent on my hands.<br> Like to smell them?<br> It's lovely. It's lily of the valley.<br> Don't you want to?<br> You want to, don't you?<br> Then behind some dark cloud<br> Where no one is allowed<br> I'll make love to the man<br> In the moon<br> She doesn't understand.<br> What a man wants is a bit of comfort.<br> You always look at me<br> like I wasn't there.<br> You see me now though, don't you?<br> Naughty. Can't you wait a bit?<br> You're a big, wicked boy, aren't you?<br> I can tell.<br> The sort to drive a girl wild.<br> Good morning, Miss Moffat.<br> Good morning, Morgan.<br> We'll... We'll work in the study.<br> Yes, Miss Moffat.<br> You will sit for your Oxford examinations<br> on the 1 st of November.<br> - We haven't a minute to waste.<br> - I understand all of that.<br> Good.<br> - Very pretty, Bessie.<br> - Stylish, yes.<br> All Miss Ronberry.<br> I hope Cheltenham doesn't let you down.<br> I think my future lies in the city.<br> I'm not the school type, you might say.<br> Experience is more my line.<br> You know, something going on.<br> - Goodbye, Bessie.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Goodbye, all.<br> - Bye-bye, Bessie.<br> Up I go.<br> Just so you don't go down.<br> - Cheers.<br> - Don't you worry about me.<br> Well, she's gone, and the Lord be praised.<br> Oh, you don't mean that. You'll miss her.<br> I shouldn't think so. I don't like her,<br> you know? I never have.<br> - But, Mrs. Watty, your own daughter.<br> - I know.<br> But I've never been able to take to her.<br> First time I saw her, I said no.<br> - You're not too tired, are you, Morgan?<br> - No.<br> I mean, in the head.<br> No, I don't think so.<br> I'm a bit worried, of course,<br> now and then, about the...<br> Examination, yes, but confident.<br> Well, yes. I try to be.<br> You should be. You're absolutely up to it.<br> I'm scared too,<br> but I'm secure about you.<br> The main thing in any challenge<br> is to keep your head.<br> If you come to something you feel<br> you don't know, skip it for the moment.<br> Don't muddle about.<br> Answer everything you can.<br> Fast, clear, simply.<br> Then go back.<br> A try is better than a blank.<br> Who knows? You may hit it.<br> You have to sort of keep<br> your sense of humor.<br> That really means not being too tired,<br> not being too focused in one direction.<br> That's why we walk and laugh,<br> pick the wild flowers...<br> ...enjoy God's gifts.<br> It cools the engine, levels things.<br> - I think my engine is cool.<br> - Good.<br> I think so too.<br> - I'll run a bit. I'll meet you at the rock.<br> - Off you go.<br> Five minutes to 9.<br> - Who was that?<br> - It was only Mr. Jones.<br> - Announcing the time again.<br> - Oh, I wish he wouldn't.<br> We're all nervy enough without that.<br> Still raining, I see.<br> Wouldn't it be splendid if he won?<br> Oh, not very likely, not very likely.<br> He's up against wealthy boys who've<br> been preparing for this since they were 6.<br> - But surely he has a chance.<br> - A chance. A teeny little chance.<br> The syllabus<br> rather attaches importance...<br> ...to general information<br> of the academic sort.<br> His is bound to be patchy.<br> I've had to force it.<br> Two and a half years isn't enough,<br> even for him.<br> - It's odd.<br> - What is?<br> What is odd? You are odd. I am odd.<br> I woke up in the middle of the night<br> thinking about Henry Vlll.<br> I have a feeling there might be<br> a question there...<br> ...about the old boy and the papacy.<br> I'll cram a few facts into him<br> at the last minute.<br> Oh, my, my, my.<br> He must win it.<br> Bessie.<br> Your mother had a letter from you<br> only yesterday.<br> Bessie.<br> Well, this is unexpected.<br> Isn't it just?<br> Yes, you...<br> - You've arrived at an inconvenient time.<br> - Oh, fancy.<br> - Why are you here?<br> - I've come to see you.<br> I'll be in the study.<br> Morgan Evans is taking<br> his Oxford examination here this morning.<br> - Well, he needn't.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Because he won't ever be going<br> to Oxford.<br> Why not?<br> Because there's gonna be<br> a little stranger.<br> You're lying.<br> Dr. Brett, The Firs, Cheltenham.<br> And if you don't believe<br> it's Morgan Evans'...<br> ...you ask him about the night<br> you and him had that row.<br> Stupid of me. Stupid, stupid.<br> Does he know?<br> Nobody knows.<br> He'll have to marry me.<br> - Give the little stranger a name.<br> - Stop saying "little stranger."<br> If you must have a baby,<br> then call it a baby.<br> The squire is coming up the road.<br> Bessie, how did you get here?<br> - I came by the coach...<br> - Mr. Jones.<br> We're having a rather private talk,<br> if you...<br> - Yes, of course, but the squire...<br> - Yes, yes, I understand perfectly.<br> - But for now...<br> - I'll just wait here for Morgan.<br> For the next three hours,<br> he must not be disturbed.<br> And you are not going to see him.<br> You can't bully me, the way I am.<br> Couldn't see what was happening<br> right under your nose...<br> ...because you were too busy<br> managing everything.<br> You can't manage him any longer.<br> He's got to manage me now!<br> - Morgan has turned the corner up the hill.<br> - There isn't much time.<br> Yes, I understand. I'm afraid I'm gonna do<br> a little managing now myself.<br> You're going up to your mother's room<br> to wait until this session is finished.<br> - Then we'll have our little talk.<br> - He's here. I've got to see him.<br> If you try and disobey me...<br> ...I shall not be responsible<br> for the consequences.<br> - You wouldn't dare lay a finger on me.<br> - Yes, I would.<br> If you attempt to stay in this room<br> or to blab to anyone...<br> ...about this before we've had<br> our talk, even your mother...<br> ...l'm in a pretty nervous state myself<br> this morning...<br> ...and I shall strike you so hard,<br> I shall probably kill you.<br> I mean every word of that.<br> Now, move.<br> If you wanna get rid of me,<br> it's gonna cost you a pretty penny.<br> Don't worry.<br> I'll make it more than worth your while,<br> but we'll talk about it later.<br> - No, not you.<br> - That's right.<br> I want Bessie to wait upstairs in your room<br> until the examination is over.<br> Very well, ma'am.<br> Where did you get that coat?<br> - It's a present.<br> - Oh, that's all right.<br> - Squire.<br> - Oh, good morning.<br> - Good morning, let me take your coat.<br> - Thank you.<br> - How kind of you to come.<br> - Not at all, Mistress Pedagogue.<br> You'll have to explain to me exactly<br> what you expect me to do.<br> - We only have to invigilate.<br> - Invigilate?<br> Sounds positively indecent.<br> We were appointed by the university.<br> It's simply a question of our being present<br> while he's sitting the examination...<br> ...so that he won't cheat.<br> Poor little beggar,<br> doesn't stand a chance.<br> Don't say that.<br> To cheat, I mean, with us on the job.<br> I am sorry.<br> I've got some spiffing good news<br> for you, my dear.<br> I've bought the barn from Sir Herbert.<br> We can move the whole shoot over<br> come the spring.<br> Now, what do you think of that?<br> Oh, how thrilling.<br> Yes, yes.<br> - Is that all our headmistress is going to say?<br> - No, no. No, it is thrilling.<br> It's just that this examination, it's very...<br> Makes me nervous.<br> Run.<br> - Hello.<br> - Morgan.<br> Good morning, my boy.<br> Good day, sir.<br> I have a feeling that there may be<br> a question on Henry Vlll.<br> Memorize those two dates.<br> - Jolly good luck.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> White heather, just a thought.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Glad it isn't me.<br> - Don't be exuberant.<br> - No.<br> - Don't be illegible.<br> - No.<br> Aren't you going to wish<br> my little protg good fortune?<br> - Good luck.<br> - Thank you.<br> Begin.<br> Henry Vlll.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's gone.<br> - What's gone?<br> - I know I put it in my pocket.<br> - Where is it?<br> - What?<br> This bloody suit. I can't find anything.<br> All this fancy stuff, no key.<br> - What key, boy?<br> - The key to my case.<br> It's gone, it's gone.<br> I must have dropped it...<br> Now, calm down, Morgan. We stop.<br> I'm sure I saw you put it in your pocket.<br> I know, I did put it in my pocket,<br> but where is it?<br> We'll miss the train.<br> We'll have to go back.<br> - Check your pockets again.<br> - I already have.<br> Check them again.<br> I'm sorry, I... There's another pocket<br> inside the pocket.<br> No matter. Off we go.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm afraid we're going to have<br> to stop again. His birth certificate.<br> I put it in my bag.<br> I remember putting it in this bag,<br> and it isn't here.<br> Not to worry.<br> Where did you get that?<br> Bit of pages.<br> Miss Moffat, please tell me again<br> what I'm supposed to do.<br> I get to Oxford...<br> You get to Oxford.<br> You meet the nine other finalists.<br> Then you probably<br> will be introduced to the master...<br> ...and to several of the fellows.<br> Then you take the oral examination.<br> - The viva.<br> - Viva voce, living voice. If you live.<br> - Terrifying.<br> - Yes.<br> All life is terrifying, Morgan.<br> You just have to do your best.<br> And you will. You're a Welshman.<br> Then you come back here,<br> and we wait.<br> We wait for their decision.<br> Yes or...<br> Or no.<br> No or yes.<br> Yes or no.<br> - Any news?<br> - Not yet.<br> I thought not.<br> You don't appear to be nervous.<br> I'm past being nervous.<br> If he's won, I shan't believe it, flatly.<br> And if he has lost?<br> If he has lost...<br> ...we must proceed<br> as if nothing had happened.<br> The sun rises and sets every day,<br> and while it does...<br> ...we jolly well have to revolve around it.<br> The time to sit up and take notice<br> will be the day it decides not to appear.<br> You're a clinker, you are, ma'am.<br> I hope so, Watty.<br> You're here.<br> - Well...<br> - I'm not hopeful.<br> Why not?<br> - They talked to me for one hour at the viva.<br> - There's nothing wrong with that. Go on.<br> They jumped down hard on the New<br> Testament question, as you said they would.<br> - You're very pale.<br> - Oh, better than raging fever. Go on.<br> Well...<br> I spent five minutes explaining why St. Paul<br> sailed from a town 300 miles inland.<br> Oh, dear. Parnell?<br> Was gonna stick up for him, but when<br> they started with "that Parnell"...<br> ...I told a tale against him<br> for half an hour.<br> Wasn't born a Welshman for nothing.<br> - Did the president send for you?<br> - I had half an hour with him.<br> - You did?<br> - Yes, but so did the other nine candidates.<br> He was a very kind<br> and grand old gentleman...<br> ...sitting in a drawing room<br> the size of Penllyn Town Hall.<br> - I talked about religion, same as you said.<br> - "Just as you advised."<br> Just as you advised.<br> He asked me if I'd ever had strong drink,<br> and I looked him in the eye and said, "No."<br> - Of course.<br> - I was terrible... Terribly nervous.<br> My collar stud fell off and I had to hold on<br> to my collar with one hand.<br> And he did not seem impressed<br> with me at all.<br> He was very curious about you.<br> Did you know there was an article<br> in the post about the school?<br> Never mind about that.<br> What else makes you despondent?<br> The other candidates.<br> They appear to me brilliant.<br> I never thought they would be, somehow.<br> There was two from Eton,<br> one from Harrow.<br> One of them very rich.<br> I never thought a scholarship man<br> might be rich.<br> - He had his own servant.<br> - Gosh.<br> And the servant looked so like my father<br> I thought it was at first.<br> And as I was leaving...<br> ...the examiners appeared to be sorry<br> for me in some way.<br> And I received the impression<br> that I'd failed.<br> - When shall we know?<br> - The day after tomorrow.<br> They're writing to you.<br> The villagers are all in their best...<br> ...dressed up, talking about a holiday.<br> Stupid of them,<br> because if you've failed...<br> If I've failed?<br> - Don't speak about it.<br> - We must speak about it.<br> You faced that possibility<br> the day you left for Oxford...<br> But I've been to Oxford,<br> and come back since then.<br> Ever since the day I was born...<br> ...l've been a prisoner<br> behind a stone wall.<br> Now somebody has given me a leg up<br> to have a look at the other side.<br> They cannot drag me back again.<br> They must give me a push<br> and send me over.<br> If three days at Oxford<br> can do this to you...<br> Yes, that's just it.<br> It would be everything I need,<br> everything.<br> Starling and I spent three hours one night<br> discussing the law.<br> - Starling. You know, the brilliant one.<br> - Yes.<br> Words came pouring out of me.<br> All the words that I'd learnt<br> and written down, but never spoken.<br> I suppose I was talking a lot of nonsense,<br> but I was at least holding a conversation.<br> I suddenly realized that I had never<br> done it before. I'd never been able to.<br> "How are you, Morgan?"<br> "Nice day, Mr. Jones.<br> Not bad for the harvest."<br> A vocabulary of 20 words.<br> And there I was with Starling, talking,<br> I came out of his rooms that night<br> and I walked down the High.<br> - That's their High Street, you know?<br> - Yes.<br> I looked up, and there was a moon<br> behind Mag... Magdalen.<br> And everybody was walking very fast<br> with their gowns on.<br> And the bells were ringing, and I was<br> walking faster than anybody. And I felt...<br> The same as on the rum<br> in the old days.<br> All of a sudden, in one big rush...<br> ...I saw this room.<br> - You and me sitting here, studying.<br> - Yes.<br> And all those books.<br> Everything I've learned<br> from those books and from you...<br> ...was lighted up like a magic lantern.<br> Ancient Rome, Greece,<br> Shakespeare, Milton.<br> Everything had a meaning<br> because I was in a new world.<br> My world now.<br> And so it came to me<br> why you worked like a slave...<br> ...to make me ready for this scholarship.<br> I can talk to you now.<br> Yes.<br> I'm glad.<br> There's no sign... There you are, Morgan.<br> - Good day, sir.<br> - Well?<br> They're sending the results.<br> - I find this waiting quite a strain.<br> - Somebody said they'd seen...<br> - Day after tomorrow.<br> - Were the examiners all right, my boy?<br> - Rather sticky, sir.<br> - Well, I expect they're all old fogies.<br> - Somebody said they'd seen Morgan.<br> - Day after tomorrow.<br> - Morgan, how are you, dear?<br> - Morgan.<br> - You're back.<br> - The suspense is terrible.<br> - Are you hungry?<br> - Yes, I am a bit.<br> I've done you something lovely<br> in the oven.<br> Oh, Morgan, the excitement.<br> I've never known nothing like it before,<br> not in all my life.<br> Morgan, my boy, are you not exhausted<br> after your journey?<br> - Would you not like something to eat?<br> - I'm gonna take him and feed him.<br> Get him something to eat<br> before that mob get hold of him...<br> ...and treat him to a hero's welcome.<br> Oh, he's looking very well, isn't he?<br> You seemed in a hurry<br> to get them out of the room.<br> What's the matter?<br> Hello.<br> How do you do?<br> I'm very well, indeed, thank you.<br> How are you? Blooming?<br> Yes, thank you. What is this?<br> - Bessie.<br> - Hello, Miss Ronberry.<br> How's geography?<br> The world's still going around in circles?<br> Hello, Mr. Jones. Flirty as ever.<br> To what do we owe this honor?<br> Well, it's like this... Don't you push me.<br> Three days ago, she sent you money.<br> - Did you not receive the letter?<br> - Yes, I did...<br> ...and all the others<br> till I was sick of them.<br> What is all this?<br> Last week, I was glancing<br> through the Mid-Wales Gazette...<br> ...and I'm here to congratulate a certain<br> young gentleman on a scholarship...<br> ...he might have won.<br> - What has that to do with you?<br> - Please, don't say it.<br> Four weeks yesterday, I had a baby boy.<br> - You had a what?<br> - Baby boy.<br> Seven pounds, 13 ounces.<br> - It is a disgusting subject.<br> - It isn't disgusting at all.<br> If I had a wedding,<br> wouldn't you think it was sweet?<br> I'm just gonna take<br> Morgan's luggage upstairs.<br> - Yes, and I'll take his...<br> - Well, I'll be blowed.<br> - No.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hello. I've just been telling them<br> about you-know-what.<br> You little slut!<br> - Is that your basket?<br> - It's mine, all right.<br> - What's in it?<br> - Well, it ain't no picnic lunch, I can tell you.<br> Oh, to think she was in my class.<br> - This horrible, unnatural happening.<br> - Don't talk nonsense.<br> It isn't horrible and it isn't unnatural.<br> On the contrary...<br> ...it's Mother Nature giving civilization<br> a nasty tweak on the nose.<br> I think it's time you told us<br> who the fellow was.<br> - Well, as a matter of fact, it's...<br> - Morgan Evans.<br> What?<br> - I don't believe it.<br> - That's right.<br> I've got a four-week-old baby,<br> kicking and healthy and hungry.<br> And I've got no husband to keep him.<br> So his father's got to<br> turn into my husband.<br> That's only fair, isn't it?<br> I'm inclined to agree with her, I'm sorry.<br> You're sorry!<br> What the hell do you think I am?<br> - My friend will be furious.<br> - Friend?<br> The gentleman I've got in Cheltenham.<br> Gentleman?<br> He's quiet a swell, actually.<br> - Anything I can do, I'll be outside.<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> He's sporting, owns a race course.<br> I only met him 10 weeks ago.<br> Started serving behind a bar for fun.<br> I was the picture of health...<br> ...and ever so lucky in the counter<br> being very high.<br> Then, when you stepped out<br> from behind the counter...<br> ...the gentleman changed his mind<br> about marrying you, that it?<br> On the contrary, he talks of nothing else.<br> - Then what is the impediment?<br> - Oh, "the impediment."<br> Fancy. The impediment<br> is he won't have the baby.<br> So I've got to give up my friend<br> to marry Morgan.<br> Unless... You don't suppose Morgan<br> would consider the kid without me?<br> The baby, without you?<br> Your child?<br> - What about your mother love?<br> - Do you know I haven't any?<br> What a vile thing to say.<br> I didn't want the baby.<br> Nobody would have.<br> I was careful so it'd be all right.<br> Oh, blazes, I want a good time too.<br> My bit of fun, while I'm still<br> young enough to enjoy it.<br> I should have drowned her at birth.<br> You mean, if you could get rid of the...<br> I mean, respectably rid of the baby,<br> you'd be satisfied?<br> - That's a crude way of putting it.<br> - Yes, let's be crude.<br> - Where's Morgan?<br> - Or let's at least be factual.<br> - You never did like me, did you?<br> - No, but that's not the point.<br> You have a baby, you don't want the baby,<br> I will take the baby.<br> - You? Oh, don't make me laugh.<br> - Oh, ma'am.<br> Well, why not? I think of all the available<br> prospects, I'm the logical choice.<br> - But you don't know anything about babies.<br> - That doesn't matter.<br> - I'll bloody well learn. Get the basket.<br> - You get it.<br> Very well.<br> I had no idea he'd be so small.<br> Looks like a very nice baby.<br> Are you satisfied, Bessie? Are you?<br> What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?<br> - I shall adopt it. Are you satisfied?<br> - Good for you.<br> Yes, I suppose I am.<br> His papers.<br> Poor kid.<br> Well, that's that.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Don't mention it, I'm sure.<br> - Go on, then, bad news. Clear out.<br> - Don't you worry, granny, I'll clear out.<br> Books, books, look at them all.<br> I've got more out of life at my age<br> than she has out with them all her days...<br> ...and I'll get a lot more yet.<br> You'll never get anything out of life<br> but a cheap thrill...<br> ...so you'd better hurry.<br> Thrills wilt with the passage of time.<br> Au revoir, Miss Paleface.<br> Well, she's gone.<br> - And that's all settled then.<br> - For which we must be truly thankful.<br> In a manner of speaking.<br> - Has she gone?<br> - Why?<br> - The squire came to see me.<br> - Oh, that fool. That poor idiotic fool.<br> She and I... We don't know each other at all.<br> It was a long time ago.<br> I never thought again about it.<br> And neither did she, I know she didn't.<br> - But we're going to adopt it.<br> - What?<br> I am going to adopt it.<br> What in hell do you take me for?<br> - Please, let me explain...<br> - No, I will listen to nothing.<br> I'm gonna do what any fellow must do,<br> I'm gonna marry her.<br> You must try and understand...<br> Bessie Watty and I are gonna get married<br> as soon as possible, and that is final.<br> A telegram.<br> Open it, please.<br> You have won a scholarship.<br> First, Evans, second, Fayver-lles,<br> third, Starling.<br> He's won.<br> - He's won.<br> - Please, please, everybody outside.<br> Morgan Evans has won the scholarship.<br> He's won.<br> Listen to me, Morgan.<br> For the first time, we're together.<br> We're friends in the true sense of the word.<br> The clock is ticking<br> and there isn't a minute to lose.<br> - I'm going to marry her.<br> - And I am going to talk to you very simply.<br> I want you to change suddenly<br> from a boy to a man.<br> The decision you make now<br> will affect you the rest of your life.<br> Think. Think.<br> And think sensibly.<br> - Did you ever promise her marriage?<br> - No, never.<br> - Did you tell her you were in love with her?<br> - No, never.<br> Then your situation now<br> is the purest accident.<br> It's happened before,<br> it will happen again.<br> Only one thing matters...<br> ...there is a child living and breathing<br> on this earth...<br> ...and living and breathing<br> because of me.<br> - I have a duty.<br> - Of course you have a duty to the child.<br> I'm not blind. I know that.<br> But you have a duty too<br> to go out into the world...<br> ...and make something of yourself.<br> Not a duty, Morgan,<br> to go down the drain.<br> - But why should you pick up the pieces?<br> - I'm happy to.<br> I'm happy to.<br> We're friends, don't you understand that?<br> - That is my privilege.<br> - I cannot let you.<br> Two wrongs have never made a right.<br> You...<br> You have brains.<br> You have shrewdness,<br> eloquence, imagination.<br> And Oxford can give you enough<br> of the graces.<br> - For what?<br> - Maybe to become...<br> "When you walk in the dark...<br> ...you can touch with your hands<br> the leaves on the trees."<br> Remember?<br> "And underneath,<br> where the corn is green."<br> We all walk in the dark, Morgan.<br> And each of us must<br> turn on his own light.<br> Don't...<br> Don't lock yourself into a situation<br> which cannot succeed.<br> It cannot succeed.<br> Not for you, not for her,<br> not for your child.<br> You could be a man<br> for us to be proud of.<br> Perhaps I'm mad.<br> I don't know.<br> It's up to you.<br> Is it all right to ring the bell<br> to say holiday today?<br> Yes.<br> Ring the bell, Mr. Jones.<br> Good for you.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> Then don't say anything.<br> I've been so much time in this room.<br> And the lessons are over.<br> I'll be back.<br> We'll be here.<br> Thank you.<br> School tomorrow, same as usual,<br> Miss Moffat?<br> School tomorrow, same as usual.<br>
