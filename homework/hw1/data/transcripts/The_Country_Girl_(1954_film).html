                        Here's a coffee, Bernie.<br> Coffee, Mr Cook?<br> Let's discuss it. Don't pout as if<br> I'd just taken away your tricycle.<br> I'm not pouting. I just disagree.<br> But Frank Elgin?<br> Let the doorman read for the part!<br> Phil, we've been in rehearsal<br> for five days.<br> Our leading man was dreadful. Maybe<br> I was the wrong director for him.<br> We let him go yesterday.<br> We do not have a replacement.<br> We open in Boston on the 28th.<br> We are in trouble.<br> - I can do without the sarcasm.<br> - Let me audition him for you.<br> Phil, there's no harm<br> in giving the man a reading.<br> I agree with you, but when<br> I wanted to read Ray Watson,<br> that was a waste of time,<br> and he's a better actor than Elgin.<br> A lot of guys can act or sing better,<br> but nobody can do both as well.<br> - What about Billy Hertz?<br> - He's pompous.<br> This isn't Student Prince<br> or Blossom Time.<br> The guy has to act while he's singing<br> and sing while he's acting.<br> In Lonesome Town, Elgin played<br> a part like this. He was magnificent.<br> - Ask Henry. He played the piano.<br> - When?<br> - Eight years ago.<br> - He didn't fall off bar stools then.<br> - He hasn't had a drink in ages.<br> - To a drunk, ten minutes is ages.<br> - I just want you to listen to him!<br> - All right, go ahead!<br> Larry?<br> - As soon as Elgin comes in...<br> - He's here.<br> I didn't want to interrupt.<br> Send him in.<br> Now, Cookie, no cracks, please.<br> - What are you auditioning, owls?<br> - Hello, Frank. Bernie Dodd.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Our producer, Mr Cook.<br> - Hello. How are you?<br> - Paul Unger and Henry Johnson.<br> - Hey, Henry!<br> - It's been a long time.<br> I told him to write his own music.<br> You took my advice, huh?<br> - How's the family?<br> - Fine.<br> - Is your boy in high school?<br> - The Air Force.<br> - No!<br> - Yes, he is.<br> Let's get started.<br> I've got a luncheon date.<br> This is an offbeat show, a<br> dramatisation of The Land Around Us.<br> - You remember the book?<br> - Sure.<br> The boys have done<br> an exciting musical adaptation.<br> The music is part of the fabric,<br> woven in and out.<br> Keep the seats from getting dusty,<br> give them something different.<br> Yeah. Would you read<br> a couple of scenes for Mr Cook?<br> - There's one in the first act...<br> - Excuse me.<br> You were speaking of Lonesome Town.<br> Frank could do the Pitchman number.<br> That'd show Phil everything.<br> - All right.<br> - If I remember it. You sure you do?<br> I should. Eight performances a week<br> for a year and a half.<br> - Describe the number to Mr Cook.<br> - OK.<br> It wasn't much, really.<br> I played one of those pitchmen,<br> sort of a fanciful character.<br> Instead of selling a patent medicine,<br> I was selling a philosophy,<br> a sunshine salesman.<br> The scene was a New York<br> street corner, under a lamppost.<br> I had a... Is it OK<br> if I use this for a minute?<br> - Use anything you like.<br> - Thanks.<br> - When I made my entrance...<br> - OK, I get it. Get on with it.<br> I was carrying an imaginary valise,<br> one of those pitchman's outfits.<br> OK, Henry.<br> And then a crowd of sourpusses<br> began to gather round.<br> A left-handed Indian, this kid.<br> Friends, I have here in this valise<br> nostrums, cure-alls, panaceas,<br> unguents, oils and healing waters.<br> What did you say, son?<br> You say the valise is empty?<br> Son, this valise is loaded.<br> You're just looking at it,<br> and your windows are foggy.<br> What did you say?<br> You can't see nothing?<br> There's no trick in believing in<br> what you see.<br> The trick is believing in<br> what you can't see.<br> You've got to visualise<br> the indiscernible.<br> Every item in this valise belongs<br> to you as well as it does to me.<br> What's that you say, Officer?<br> Have I got a licence?<br> Just the greatest licence<br> in the world, poetic licence.<br> You been listening to my pitch?<br> We're going to the station house?<br> You got a desk sergeant<br> who's a little cantankerous?<br> Here's how we'll handle his case.<br> Share it among you, friends.<br> Tell them where you got it.<br> - You have a good beat for a writer.<br> - Fine, Frank.<br> You ought to hear it with<br> an orchestra. It's good and lousy.<br> - Wait outside for a second.<br> - I'm a little in the dark.<br> Is it a musical spot,<br> a small part or what?<br> It's the lead, Frank. The whole show<br> is built around this character.<br> Well, didn't it speak for itself?<br> He's probably been doing that<br> at dinner parties for ten years.<br> Did it prove he's worth<br> risking $200,000 on?<br> Did it prove he can carry a show?<br> Be sensible. That guy's been<br> in the pickle since you were a kid.<br> Someone took a chance with Laurette<br> Taylor in The Glass Menagerie.<br> Bernie, what are you trying to prove?<br> We've got a good book, good music.<br> Why can't you be satisfied<br> with a reliable, sober actor?<br> He'll give you<br> a reliable, sober performance.<br> That's not what people pay to see.<br> - You fought me over Danelli.<br> - I think you were wrong.<br> Instead of teaching an actor to box,<br> you teach a punch-drunk fighter<br> to act.<br> - He gave you a great performance.<br> - He gave us trouble, too.<br> If there was a fight at the Garden,<br> he wouldn't show up.<br> With Elgin, you'll get something<br> that happens once in 20 years.<br> I'll get it out of him.<br> - You're good, but not that good.<br> - People have always said that to me.<br> So now you're going to show them,<br> every one of them.<br> Directing doesn't satisfy you.<br> You want to take a corpse<br> and breathe life into it.<br> Maybe I'm crazy.<br> Doesn't this worry you guys?<br> - Not if it doesn't worry Bernie.<br> - He's too old for the part.<br> Hairpieces will make him look<br> ten years younger.<br> All right. Could we look for<br> someone else while he's rehearsing?<br> No, we don't let him go<br> without real cause,<br> a binge, or if he can't retain lines.<br> Give him a run-of-the-play contract.<br> - Wait a minute!<br> - I need his complete confidence.<br> No! I'll take a $40,000 loss before I<br> give him a run-of-the-play contract.<br> - OK, two weeks. Agreed, Paul? Henry?<br> - OK with me.<br> Frank? Frank Elgin?<br> - Elgin left.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - He left.<br> - Where? Coffee? What?<br> He just walked out. He didn't say.<br> Try the nearest bar.<br> - Mr Elgin in?<br> - No, he's not.<br> Mrs Elgin? I'd like to talk<br> to Frank. I'm Bernie Dodd.<br> I don't know when Frank will be back.<br> Mind if I wait?<br> - Would you like some coffee?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Did Frank say when he'd be back?<br> - He didn't say where he was going.<br> - Didn't he say he had an audition?<br> - No.<br> I looked around after it was over,<br> but he'd gone.<br> - Will he do?<br> - That all depends.<br> If you're wondering if you can get<br> Frank for very little money, you can.<br> It doesn't depend on that.<br> Does he still drink?<br> Just what did you think<br> I would answer to that?<br> - Touch.<br> - What?<br> - Touch. In French, that means...<br> - Everybody knows what it means.<br> You're even younger than I thought.<br> You try to look like an old lady.<br> You shouldn't do your hair like that.<br> Some women pay too much attention to<br> themselves and some don't pay enough.<br> That's quite a pearl of wisdom.<br> May I quote you?<br> - How long have you been married?<br> - Ten years.<br> - Did you meet in a show?<br> - Look, Mr Dodd...<br> - Were you ever an actress?<br> - Not me, thank you.<br> I'm just a girl from the country.<br> The theatre and its people have<br> always been a complete mystery to me.<br> They still are.<br> Dreiser, Balzac, Montaigne.<br> Who reads these books?<br> I do.<br> I'm afraid to ask if you enjoy them.<br> Montaigne's too polite for me.<br> - That doesn't surprise me.<br> - Frank's old recordings?<br> Some new. There's one on the machine<br> he did last week.<br> A man with his talent.<br> It's degrading.<br> So is not eating.<br> Why didn't you wait?<br> I figured the boat had sailed.<br> The producer didn't like me.<br> Since when does a producer<br> have to love an actor?<br> I can't go to battle unless<br> everybody is rooting for me.<br> - Cook thinks you're a drinker.<br> - Not on a show.<br> Not according to Maxwell.<br> You worked for him in '46.<br> After a couple of months,<br> he had to replace you.<br> While I was playing in that show,<br> our son died.<br> What about this show? I need an actor<br> who can stay sober and learn lines.<br> Are you that actor or not?<br> Make up your mind.<br> Give me time. Cook wasn't<br> the only reason I left the theatre.<br> I wouldn't take a part like this<br> without talking it over with Georgie.<br> - I'll be back in ten minutes.<br> - He's afraid of the responsibility.<br> But the gamble's all on my side!<br> It's not a question of being afraid<br> of the responsibility.<br> The part's the whole show.<br> You said so yourself.<br> You're opening in Boston the 28th.<br> I don't think I could learn<br> the lines. You need Walter Huston.<br> It's bad enough to go to Hollywood<br> to cast. You suggest I go to heaven?<br> - You can do it, Frank.<br> - Why are you so sure?<br> When I was a hat-check boy,<br> you, Lunt and Jolson were my heroes.<br> - I know everything you've done.<br> - You exaggerate to make your point.<br> - Are you for him or against him?<br> - I'm his wife.<br> I want honesty from both of you.<br> Flattery is cheap.<br> How about a little costly truth?<br> I'm not blind to Frank's condition.<br> This room tells me what he is.<br> I'm not one of those nice people<br> who buys you a drink and that's it.<br> I won't leave you on a limb. We'll<br> work together and worry together.<br> But if you do me dirt, just once,<br> no pity, not a drop of pity.<br> No pity. I like that.<br> Now he knows what to expect.<br> - What contract do you offer?<br> - Standard two-week contract.<br> - You could let Frank out any time?<br> - Exactly.<br> He won't have confidence with<br> a two-week clause. Would you?<br> I have nothing in my mind<br> except for Frank to play this part.<br> That's sentiment again.<br> I come here with the best intentions.<br> Suddenly I find I'm victimising you.<br> - Did I bring you a basket of snakes?<br> - It's not the two-weeks clause.<br> I don't want to bite off<br> more than I can chew.<br> We're in Boston for two weeks.<br> We can stay out until you're perfect.<br> - Would you do that?<br> - I'd insist on it.<br> Talk it over with your agent.<br> Call the office by 3 p.m., no later.<br> Need a $20 bill?<br> You need it.<br> Why did you make that crack<br> about responsibility?<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> about that audition?<br> Because I wasn't sure<br> whether I could make it.<br> I must have walked up and down<br> 47th Street a dozen times.<br> - Don't keep things from me.<br> - I can't do it, can I?<br> Of course you can. You've got to try.<br> It's a perfect opportunity.<br> If I do take it, Georgie,<br> I'll need you every step of the way.<br> I don't have any appointments,<br> Frank, all winter.<br> - I wish it were a run-of-the-play...<br> - Why didn't you tell him?<br> I didn't want to antagonise him.<br> I have to work with him.<br> You'll never get a better deal,<br> so take it and do your level best.<br> Wait a minute. The two-weeks clause.<br> They can give me notice any time,<br> but I can give them notice, too.<br> - I can walk out any time I want.<br> - You mean you can quit, Frank.<br> Not the way you mean it.<br> If the show doesn't pan out, I don't<br> want to come to New York in a turkey.<br> Maybe this time, it will work out.<br> Bernie likes me.<br> Henry Johnson's pulling for me.<br> It's Cook I got to worry about.<br> We've been having trouble, Joe.<br> Instead of fields of wheat,<br> we got stubble rotting in the dust.<br> I've talked it over with Stella.<br> We're leaving.<br> What are we waiting for?<br> Let's push on.<br> - How about you, Joe?<br> - I'm staying.<br> They say when a man falls<br> from a great height,<br> his whole life flashes by.<br> In one split second,<br> he sees himself for what he is.<br> You don't have to plummet like a<br> hailstone to face that split second.<br> Mean it, Frank.<br> ...plummet like a hailstone<br> to face that split second.<br> It can come to you as it did<br> to me today. As you stand...<br> - What is it?<br> - "...in a smouldering field."<br> As you stand in a smouldering field<br> and see your hopes go up in smoke.<br> This is the most important<br> decision in the man's life.<br> It sounds like he's deciding<br> what to have for breakfast!<br> That goes for the rest of you, too.<br> I'm sorry, but I'm still<br> fighting these words.<br> We've been in rehearsal ten days.<br> Let's take it from...<br> - Bernie.<br> - It can't be that late.<br> Where does it go? Knock off.<br> Same time tomorrow.<br> We'll start with this scene.<br> - See you tomorrow.<br> - Good night.<br> - Do you need me for anything?<br> - No.<br> - You want me to turn off the border?<br> - Yeah. Good night.<br> I'm sorry about the words.<br> I've had a lot of things on my mind.<br> I know you have.<br> Every time I give a direction,<br> you're off in space somewhere.<br> You can be great, but it demands<br> your concentration and energy.<br> I know. I keep telling myself that.<br> After rehearsal,<br> I go home to study and...<br> You've got headaches enough.<br> Good night.<br> - Frank? Having trouble at home?<br> - No, nothing like that.<br> - Don't you believe me?<br> - Everyone has trouble at home.<br> The ones who deny it<br> are those that have too much of it.<br> I denied it for five years<br> with the former Mrs Dodd.<br> I never had the impression<br> that you were married.<br> Neither did my wife.<br> That was my trouble. What's yours?<br> It's nothing important.<br> I'll see you in the morning.<br> - Does she want you to play the part?<br> - She's all for it.<br> The day I met her,<br> she seemed a little difficult<br> about terms, rather domineering.<br> - She wasn't always like that.<br> - I know.<br> They start out as Juliets<br> and wind up as Lady Macbeths.<br> When I first met her, she was as fine<br> a person as you've ever seen.<br> She had background and breeding.<br> She had a nobility about her that<br> made me feel proud to be with her.<br> I was a good deal older than she was,<br> but it didn't seem to matter.<br> She wasn't a flighty kid.<br> She had a poise and dignity<br> that was ageless.<br> Those first few years,<br> I never knew a better life.<br> A wife who was everything<br> I'd been looking for.<br> A son who was smart, healthy.<br> Then our son died.<br> I came home from the theatre<br> one night a couple of months later.<br> This kid, I don't think she ever<br> had a real drink in her life before.<br> There she is, stretched out<br> across the bed, dead drunk,<br> her wrists cut and bleeding.<br> She was jealous that I had my work,<br> something to live for.<br> She felt she had nothing.<br> Inside of a year,<br> she was a hopeless drunkard.<br> In an effort to give her<br> some purpose in life,<br> I made her feel that<br> I needed her in my work.<br> I let her pick the songs I should<br> record, the shows I ought to do.<br> She started taking over everything.<br> She became very possessive.<br> She wanted to make the decisions,<br> had to be with me all the time.<br> Whenever I was away, she acted<br> as if I'd run off with another woman.<br> She had fits of depression.<br> One time she set fire<br> to a hotel suite.<br> That's when I hit the bottle.<br> - Does she still drink?<br> - No. She stopped when I began.<br> That figures. You were the weak one<br> now. That's what she wanted.<br> - Do you have to bring her to Boston?<br> - I couldn't leave her alone.<br> You thought it was funny I didn't<br> hang around after the audition.<br> If I'd taken this part<br> without talking to her,<br> I don't know what would've happened.<br> I had to make believe<br> that I was afraid.<br> That left it open for her<br> to convince me, like it was her idea.<br> They can get awful bent out of shape,<br> can't they?<br> My wife was so twisted she said to<br> me, "I hope your next play's a flop,<br> "so the world can see I love you<br> even though you're a failure."<br> Georgie?<br> Just coming from a movie,<br> thought you might be through.<br> - Your timing was perfect, Mrs Elgin.<br> - I have a knack that way.<br> Good evening, Mr Dodd.<br> How is my husband doing?<br> In my less than humble opinion,<br> he's a natural.<br> Don't let him kid you, honey.<br> I was floundering.<br> We'll have to rehearse those cues.<br> Thank her for the words I did know.<br> Thanks.<br> - Did I intrude?<br> - No, we're just breaking up.<br> I don't like to be obtrusive<br> when Frank's working,<br> unless he needs my help.<br> - You're sure I'm not in the way?<br> - No.<br> We're just closing up shop,<br> giving it back to the theatre ghosts.<br> There's nothing quite so mysterious<br> and silent as a dark theatre.<br> A night without a star.<br> - Why don't we get some coffee?<br> - Georgie? She makes the decisions.<br> Is that true, Mrs Elgin?<br> To the extent that Frank's brought<br> out the mother in me, yes.<br> I'd like some coffee, and I'd like<br> to get to know Mr Dodd better.<br> I'd like to get to know you better.<br> Shall we go along?<br> Yes, the theatre is mysterious.<br> It sure is.<br> Hi, Charlie. Excuse me a minute.<br> No, thanks, never use them. Are you<br> really satisfied with Frank's work?<br> I'll be happy when he gets<br> the part out of his hands.<br> He has his worries with those lines.<br> I'd appreciate it<br> if you didn't add to them.<br> He seems to be more concerned<br> about you than the audience.<br> You mean he's too focused<br> on my reaction?<br> That's one way of putting it.<br> You could help by being careful<br> of what you do and say.<br> I try to be careful, but being<br> an actor's wife is not easy.<br> If I tell him he's magnificent,<br> he says I'm not honest.<br> - If not, he says I don't love him.<br> - He's good but can be better.<br> - Is that what the critics will say?<br> - Are you a critic or a wife?<br> I try in my small way to help.<br> That's what my ex-wife used to<br> keep reminding me, tearfully.<br> She had a theory that behind<br> every great man was a great woman.<br> She was convinced that she was great<br> and that all I needed<br> was guidance on her part.<br> She worked hard at it. Too hard.<br> It doesn't prove her theory<br> was completely wrong.<br> One could go through history<br> and find a few good examples.<br> It's a pity that Leonardo da Vinci<br> never had a wife to guide him.<br> He might have really got somewhere.<br> You know who that was? Charlie Blair.<br> You remember him. He was...<br> Here's another oldie.<br> It's on the hit parade again.<br> Let's listen to the original<br> recording made by Frank Elgin.<br> He's backed up<br> by Jimmy Bolton's Orchestra.<br> See if you remember it.<br> - Was that OK, Jimmy?<br> - Good.<br> Harry, you want to buy that one?<br> Sure will. I'll give you<br> the playback in a second.<br> Take five, boys.<br> You pretty near broke me up<br> with your bad beat. How'd it sound?<br> - It's a lovely tune.<br> - And the singer?<br> - He has a pleasant voice.<br> - If you were my agent, we'd starve!<br> I've got a hair appointment.<br> - You're not taking him.<br> - It's Sally's day off.<br> Oh, no. He'll grow up to be<br> a hairdresser. I'll take him.<br> To the Lambs' Club to play pool?<br> It's better than teaching him how to<br> set a wave. I'll take him to the zoo.<br> And bring him home full of peanuts,<br> ice cream and chocolate?<br> Johnny, tell this lady to run along.<br> This is strictly stag.<br> - Strictly stag.<br> - He's your responsibility.<br> If he gets a stomach ache in<br> the night, that's strictly stag, too.<br> Goodbye.<br> Isn't Mommy a doll?<br> Bye, hon.<br> - Peanuts!<br> - Yeah. First we'll hear this playback.<br> - Then Charlie wants some pictures.<br> - Take two of the chorus.<br> Can I get one shot of you looking at<br> the trademark for the album cover?<br> Make it fast. I got a date<br> with my friend here.<br> I think it would be better<br> without the hat. Right.<br> Put your hands on the record.<br> Put the right one at the bottom, too.<br> That's perfect. Just hold it.<br> Hold it. Hold it.<br> Johnny!<br> The men for the trunk<br> are downstairs...<br> - When did you get these, Frank?<br> - Last night, after you fell asleep.<br> I went out and got a paper and...<br> What's the difference?<br> - I got a good night's sleep.<br> - No more, Frank.<br> I'll get you some sleeping pills.<br> One a night can't hurt.<br> I'm not sure I'm going to Boston.<br> What's the use? I'll never<br> go through with this show.<br> I'll mess it up,<br> like everything else.<br> - That day was an accident.<br> - That's what the paper said.<br> - He was my responsibility that day.<br> - Frank, stop it! Stop!<br> - Have you told Dodd about this?<br> - No. Don't you tell him either.<br> I won't, but I think maybe<br> you should. It might help.<br> Nobody is going to have any respect.<br> He'd tell Cook. He'd fire me.<br> Who'd risk $200,000<br> on a guy that irresponsible?<br> Let's say you were responsible.<br> You've got to prove to yourself...<br> You don't know what it's like<br> to stand on that stage all alone.<br> If I'm no good, the show's no good.<br> I've got the future of 100 people<br> in my hand. This hand.<br> - Elgin, trunk for Boston?<br> - Come in.<br> - Theatre or hotel?<br> - Theatre.<br> - No...<br> - Everything's packed. It's ready.<br> "THE LAND AROUND US"<br> THEATRE<br> Joe's nothing but a dreamer.<br> Let him show you<br> what he's been dreaming about.<br> That's fair enough. Come on, Phil.<br> How do they expect me<br> to make these fast changes?<br> - Haven't I done it right?<br> - Yes, but I want you out front.<br> - Give me the dicky!<br> - You're doing wonderfully.<br> I am not! Why don't they get me<br> a dresser? They could afford a dozen.<br> - Do you want me to talk to Cook?<br> - Yes.<br> Tell him to stop that understudy<br> hovering there like a vulture.<br> - If you talked to Mr Dodd...<br> - You talk to him.<br> Tell him to keep that guy out front.<br> Get me some new tissue.<br> I will, right after rehearsal.<br> - I'm sorry I stepped on your line.<br> - Think nothing of it.<br> - I was so nervous.<br> - What about? It's just another show.<br> Where would you find<br> a star as sweet as that?<br> What a wonderful guy.<br> I'd like to hold the orchestra<br> for about a half-hour longer.<br> - Can't you do it in the morning?<br> - Can I take the doohickeys off?<br> - Yeah, go ahead.<br> - There we are.<br> - See you tomorrow.<br> - Paul mentioned something to me.<br> - Eleanor is way overboard.<br> - I know she is.<br> - I wasn't thinking about Eleanor.<br> - Don't you think I know?<br> - I have some notes.<br> - We'll go over them tomorrow.<br> Give the company a one o'clock call.<br> I'm going out for some fresh air.<br> Then we'll discuss that spot.<br> Larry, hold Frank and Helen.<br> Run the scene in front of the church.<br> Find out what caused the mix-up.<br> You talked about the scenery<br> but not about our real problem.<br> Elgin was terrible.<br> That's why you go out of town.<br> Actors improve. The scenery can't.<br> If he spoke the script,<br> I never heard it.<br> He trips on a rug, there's no chair,<br> the door won't open.<br> What do you expect of him?<br> Besides, his wife was backstage<br> during the performance.<br> - She's enough to upset anyone.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - Lower the boom on her.<br> - He's your problem. I got my own.<br> The union insists I take on<br> three more stagehands.<br> Mr Cook, excuse me.<br> May I ask you something?<br> - Do you think Frank needs a dresser?<br> - No, but I suppose you do.<br> Well, those two fast changes.<br> It's a very large part, after all.<br> Bernie, every time you nod your head<br> like that, it costs us $200.<br> You're going to nod us<br> out of business.<br> Don't worry. We'll get him a dresser.<br> Mr Cook is almost what the bad fairy<br> promised Frank at his cradle.<br> He's not too bad.<br> Gruff, but with a heart of stone.<br> You smoke too much.<br> That's obvious.<br> A whole pack since 10.30.<br> Careful you don't catch cold.<br> After every first dress rehearsal,<br> I always hope to catch pneumonia.<br> It never works. Oh, for the peaceful<br> quiet of an oxygen tent.<br> Mr Dodd, who is that tall, gloomy man<br> that hangs around backstage?<br> Lucas, is that the name?<br> Yes. General understudy.<br> Not much personality but competent.<br> Well, excuse me for saying this,<br> but must he stay backstage?<br> It seems to bother Frank.<br> I'll watch him.<br> Is Frank that insecure?<br> He's working well, in good humour.<br> Don't you know what hides<br> behind that good humour?<br> Certain men are very strange.<br> Business couldn't be better,<br> wife and kids are fine,<br> jokes with the boys at the club.<br> The next day, he's hung himself<br> from the chandelier.<br> Is that supposed to be<br> a picture of Frank?<br> Yes and no.<br> Frank doesn't like to make a remark<br> that might lose him people's regard.<br> If anything has to be said<br> that might cause antagonism,<br> well, that's my job.<br> I hate to say this,<br> but I hired a good performer.<br> I may want him without<br> his sisters, cousins and aunts.<br> I never meant to interfere. I was<br> just offering myself as a liaison...<br> I have no problems with Frank.<br> Don't make any.<br> Before this is over,<br> you may face a couple of beauties.<br> - Is that a threat?<br> - No.<br> It's just a simple statement<br> based on experience.<br> Whether you like it or not,<br> Frank's weak. He's a leaner.<br> I happen to be the one he leans on.<br> A good, strong helpmate.<br> You and your strength might be<br> the very reason he is weak.<br> I don't like strong women.<br> I'm not here to audition for you.<br> I'm here for the same reason you are,<br> to do everything in my power<br> to make him a success in this.<br> I want to see Frank stand on his own<br> two feet for very personal reasons.<br> Then don't overplay your hand. Frank<br> can go anywhere, right to the top.<br> Or he may go back to<br> that smelly room, and you with him!<br> I got that line straightened out.<br> Helen was throwing me the wrong cue.<br> I'm glad you got it fixed.<br> Frank, I noticed the understudy<br> backstage. Does that bother you?<br> No, never even noticed. How else<br> is he going to learn his business?<br> - Is that you, Georgie?<br> - Yes.<br> - Are you coming in?<br> - In a minute.<br> I want to get a breath of fresh air.<br> I can't come out. I'm still soggy.<br> What did they say about the dresser?<br> You'll get him.<br> It looks like they've got a little<br> respect for the old man after all.<br> Yes, they have respect for you.<br> I'll be out in a second.<br> - It's a different kind of a show.<br> - Yes, but I'm enjoying it.<br> It's a beautiful production.<br> I bet the costumes cost $50,000.<br> I think it's the most exciting thing!<br> - Where did you get it?<br> - From George, for my birthday.<br> You've seen him before, years ago,<br> in that show in Central Park.<br> - Was he the same one?<br> - So easy-going and likeable.<br> - Are you catching cold?<br> - That's all I need.<br> You're smoking too much. Go to sleep.<br> - I want to see the review first.<br> - You can see it at breakfast.<br> I can't sleep. What time do they<br> deliver the paper? In the afternoon?<br> I don't know why they picked<br> this place to open in.<br> It's like getting locked<br> in a deep freeze.<br> Just came in, Mr Elgin.<br> I'll get you another sleeping pill.<br> - Hello.<br> - I didn't think I'd be waking you.<br> The only important ones<br> are the New York notices.<br> Yeah, I don't worry about<br> these out-of-town critics.<br> They don't bother me.<br> Georgie was a little upset,<br> but I reminded her of Lonesome Town.<br> The Philadelphia critics murdered us,<br> but in New York we were a smash.<br> We've got five weeks. Opening night<br> in New York, it'll be great.<br> But let's not kid ourselves.<br> It'll take an awful lot of work.<br> You've got a big day tomorrow,<br> a rehearsal, a performance<br> and production stills after that,<br> so get all the rest you can.<br> - OK.<br> - Good night.<br> The dame in this paper<br> puts her finger right on it.<br> She says, "Elgin lacks authority<br> in a role that cries for it."<br> - No authority. That's it.<br> - You know why he lacks authority?<br> Because his wife has too much of it.<br> She's got to go back to New York.<br> We ought to make it<br> transportation for two.<br> If you don't like what I'm doing,<br> make it transportation for three.<br> Now, we were discussing that scene<br> in front of the town hall.<br> We go past the climax. Let's cut<br> the scene here tomorrow night.<br> - Over a little more. That's it.<br> - Everybody out front, keep quiet.<br> Sit down and keep quiet<br> or you'll be here all night.<br> Settle down.<br> All right, here we go.<br> Stay! Hold it!<br> - OK, go ahead.<br> - Hold it. Thank you.<br> Hold those positions.<br> I want to change one thing here.<br> While Frank is speaking,<br> I want you to look directly at him.<br> And no movement, nothing that will<br> distract the audience from him.<br> He's got to be<br> the centre of attention.<br> You really think<br> it would be better that way?<br> I thought it would be kind of nice<br> and natural if I was in the crowd.<br> No, it's all wrong.<br> The words lose importance.<br> He's asking these people<br> to have faith in him, to trust him.<br> He's accepting responsibility for<br> their future. It's got to be important.<br> We'll rehearse it tomorrow.<br> I just wanted to tell you about it.<br> We've got one more shot where<br> you're here looking at the poster.<br> Yell when you're ready.<br> Turn your head towards the poster.<br> - Would you look at the poster?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> WANTED FOR MURDER<br> - Hold it.<br> - Put your hands on the record.<br> Hold it.<br> - Frank, what's the matter?<br> - I got a cold.<br> I've got some stuff in the room.<br> I'll be right back.<br> - All finished?<br> - No.<br> Frank, I don't like that cough syrup.<br> - Why not? It's a buck a bottle.<br> - You can read labels.<br> It's 22% alcohol. I'll get you<br> some lemon and honey in the morning.<br> Cook didn't come back after the show.<br> No, he didn't.<br> I'm glad I got that two-weeks clause.<br> I can quit any time I want.<br> Why should I care? They don't.<br> The producer doesn't come back<br> after the show...<br> - Leave the bottle.<br> - I need it for my cough.<br> - Leave it here.<br> - But I need it.<br> George, I need it.<br> - Frank's on stage.<br> - I know. I want to talk to you.<br> Last time we talked, Mr Dodd,<br> you reduced me to tears.<br> I promise you it won't happen again.<br> In fact, I'm glad you're here.<br> You ought to know he's getting a cold<br> and shouldn't be kept up late.<br> - We need stills. How's his spirit?<br> - Low.<br> - Why?<br> - Ask the Boston critics.<br> I've spent between<br> 10 and 15 hours a day with Frank.<br> Nothing bothers him<br> except through your mouth.<br> We've been through that.<br> Either he laughs and makes bad jokes<br> or sits in silence and rots inside.<br> Either way, for your edification,<br> he's heading for a bender.<br> Why do women always think they<br> understand men better than men do?<br> Maybe because they live with them.<br> You'll have him full of whisky<br> before morning.<br> He's getting a cold. That's a reason<br> to jump down the well.<br> Why work so hard? You handle him,<br> and now you're trying to handle me!<br> And don't think I couldn't,<br> after handling a cunning drunkard.<br> If you loved this man, you could<br> never call him a cunning drunkard.<br> I have a greater love for the truth.<br> I'm a drunkard's wife.<br> That's the truth.<br> Stop looking at everything<br> as if it were a musical comedy!<br> I find you slightly grotesque.<br> You came here to tell me<br> something. What is it?<br> Cook's got a replacement for Frank<br> and a lot of money to protect.<br> I think Frank will improve.<br> Cook thinks he won't.<br> - Well, he won't unless you leave.<br> - You'll be sorry. He'll be helpless.<br> - I'll help him.<br> - You wouldn't know where to begin!<br> I'll begin by not calling him<br> a cunning drunkard.<br> I'll give him confidence<br> by rejoicing in his talents<br> instead of reminding him<br> of his weaknesses.<br> I'll let him face a decision<br> without fear.<br> I won't stifle him with bitterness.<br> I might bend the truth, but I'll get<br> a performance out of him.<br> That's the difference. You want him<br> to become the actor he once was.<br> I'm his wife. I want him once more<br> as the man he once was,<br> able to face responsibility, and you<br> don't do that by bending the truth!<br> You don't do it by stripping him<br> of self-respect.<br> I'll fight you for this man.<br> Not too hard. I may let you have him.<br> Oh, no. You want him wholly<br> and utterly dependent.<br> You realised, with all your fine<br> breeding, you were a failure.<br> It gave you a feeling of power<br> to control someone else's life.<br> Worse, you do it in the name of love.<br> You're as phoney as an opera soprano.<br> Did I forget to tell you I'm proud?<br> Make up your mind. Either you go<br> to New York alone, or you both go.<br> I'll go, on one condition.<br> Let me tell Frank in my own way,<br> in my own time.<br> As long as you're on that train<br> by tomorrow night.<br> - The traffic's a little heavy!<br> - Finished?<br> Got it all wrapped up.<br> Frank, I'd like to run through that<br> new scene after the matine tomorrow.<br> - You tired?<br> - Me?<br> How can you be tired playing a part<br> you've waited for all your life?<br> - Your energy was low again tonight.<br> - I know. It's this cold.<br> - Are you sure it's not nerves?<br> - Are you kidding?<br> - Tell him what's bothering you.<br> - What's bothering me?<br> - Cook and the notices, for instance.<br> - Oh, that.<br> I just wondered why<br> he didn't come backstage.<br> Is he mad or something?<br> Those weren't exactly money notices.<br> Mr Dodd believes in you. I can't<br> help you if you're worried. He can.<br> But I'm not worried.<br> Did you not tell me ten minutes ago<br> that you wanted<br> to hand in your notice?<br> I was just ribbing you, honey.<br> You got to be careful around here.<br> You can't open your mouth.<br> - Your wife's returning to New York.<br> - I said nothing of the sort.<br> - What do you mean, New York?<br> - We can talk about it later.<br> Would you leave us alone, Mrs Elgin?<br> Let's get one thing straight.<br> - What is that?<br> - It's cough syrup.<br> Pine, tar, cherries,<br> a whole bush in a bottle.<br> - This stuff is 22% alcohol.<br> - Alcohol?<br> I told Georgie to get something<br> to loosen my throat.<br> - Don't you know what these can do?<br> - She didn't look at the label.<br> Maybe she did. She's jealous<br> of the show and of me.<br> This is how far she'd go.<br> She'd even kick you off the wagon.<br> - I know she's high-strung...<br> - I want her back in New York.<br> We've got hard work ahead. I haven't<br> time for frustrated females.<br> Go back to the hotel and get some<br> sleep. I want you fresh tomorrow.<br> Mrs Elgin, Frank knows<br> exactly how I feel.<br> He appreciates what has to be done.<br> See you tomorrow, Frank.<br> He can be pretty arrogant<br> and insulting.<br> He had no right<br> to treat you like that.<br> Did you tell him that?<br> I poured it in the sink. If you<br> don't believe me, go and smell it.<br> - Where's the other bottle?<br> - What other bottle?<br> I'm tired. Where's<br> the other bottle of syrup?<br> I didn't buy another bottle. I wish<br> you'd take my word for something.<br> Never mind. I give up.<br> I'm not going to look.<br> - I apologise. He had no right...<br> - Stop putting on a front.<br> - Who's putting on a front?<br> - You are! You lie, you lie, you lie!<br> - Are you going back to New York?<br> - I don't know why not.<br> You want to leave me, don't you?<br> At the moment, I want you to get<br> dressed so we can get out of here.<br> Who's in New York? Who's the guy<br> you want to get back to?<br> I'm going to hit you<br> with the first thing I pick up!<br> - Now get dressed!<br> - If you're in such a hurry, go on.<br> I'll take a walk,<br> get something to eat.<br> - It won't do your cold any good.<br> - Let them worry about it.<br> - Do you want me to go?<br> - Yes, if you're in such a hurry.<br> Have you got the key to the room?<br> I'll get one from the hotel.<br> Don't wake me up when you come in.<br> I may be having a happy dream!<br> - 65, 75.<br> - That's for you.<br> Thanks.<br> Do you like me?<br> You're one of the most likeable guys<br> I've ever seen.<br> - Jackie, sing something!<br> - I'll sing if you'll be quiet.<br> - Yeah, Love And Learn.<br> - All right, simmer down.<br> It's my turn to holler.<br> Go, dad, go!<br> What about this guy?<br> Take me home, dad.<br> Hey, aren't you Frank Elgin?<br> I used to be. Not a word<br> or I'll tell them you're Harpo Marx.<br> - The Pump Song!<br> - I'm tired. Dance a while.<br> Order up. Buy something already.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - It's all right. Another?<br> Yeah. Give me a double.<br> Pour, pour. Go ahead, fill it up.<br> Sorry about that drink.<br> It's all right. Could have happened<br> to anybody. Just an accident.<br> Yeah. Just an accident.<br> That's what the papers said.<br> It could have happened to anybody.<br> It was just an accident.<br> - Come in.<br> - Morning.<br> - Morning.<br> - How's it going?<br> - We got out 23 minutes.<br> - That's fine.<br> If we cut that chorus in half,<br> what will that give us?<br> - Another seven minutes.<br> - Good. That's where we need it.<br> Hello? Yeah.<br> What? When?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - I think you'd better come down.<br> I'll wait for you.<br> - Here's his keys, his belt.<br> - I know, I know.<br> 75, 85, 90.<br> Here's your five dollars.<br> You promised me a couple of problems.<br> I see you made good your threat.<br> I didn't threaten you. I warned you.<br> When he hadn't come in,<br> why didn't you call me?<br> - Suppose he had been with a woman?<br> - You're being evasive.<br> Sit down, Frank.<br> Get me some water, Georgie.<br> What happened, Frank? Sit up!<br> Don't act as though I'm beating you.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - What happened?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What happened after I left you?<br> - Georgie and I had a fight.<br> - I thought so.<br> - I don't know...<br> - She picked a fine time.<br> - It wasn't her fault.<br> - Stop protecting her!<br> - She's weak, she's so weak.<br> - She's driven you to drink!<br> You could be magnificent.<br> She goes back to New York.<br> - I don't know what she'd do.<br> - She goes back this morning.<br> - She's weak.<br> - I'll talk to her.<br> If we go on, you move in with me.<br> - Cook doesn't want me.<br> - I'm not sure I want you!<br> Whatever you say. You decide.<br> Frank...<br> Frank stays, you go. The management<br> will pay your expenses.<br> Frank may follow you, I'm not sure.<br> He's moving in with me.<br> Crisp as lettuce, aren't you?<br> Do you want me to go, Frank?<br> I'll go and pack.<br> Tell Frank he has nothing to worry<br> about. He thinks you may go drastic.<br> - It's happened before, I understand.<br> - What?<br> Phoney suicide attempts.<br> Mr Dodd, when I was a child,<br> the town idiot insisted that<br> elephant tusks came from piano keys,<br> but he had nothing on you.<br> Suicide attempts<br> are Frank's department.<br> Show me your wrists, Frank.<br> Show me your wrists!<br> - Did you set fire to a hotel suite?<br> - He told you that?<br> Was I a hopeless drunk?<br> Did I have fits of depression?<br> Was I possessive?<br> Did I have to have a nurse<br> watch me when he was on stage?<br> Didn't you recognise any of it?<br> That was his big speech in one of<br> the plays you admired him in<br> when you were a hat-check boy.<br> Larry... do you think the understudy<br> can play the matine?<br> Yeah, I think so.<br> Pay the fine. This is a receipt<br> for his coat, wallet and the rest.<br> Take him back to the hotel.<br> Wait. If they see him in the lobby,<br> it'll be all over the papers.<br> Take him to the theatre<br> and let him sleep it off there.<br> - Georgie...<br> - Go on, Frank.<br> I won't leave without seeing you.<br> Tell Cook I'll be along in a few minutes.<br> - May I smoke?<br> - May you smoke?<br> What is that supposed to be?<br> Homage to a lady?<br> Lt'll never make me forgive you<br> for what you've said and done.<br> I'm not asking for forgiveness.<br> I want information.<br> - What made Frank go to pieces?<br> - The responsibility became too much.<br> - Why the lying, why the cunning?<br> - He hates himself.<br> Consequently, he'll do or say<br> anything to be liked by others.<br> People like Frank ought to have<br> two votes.<br> Then they could vote<br> Democrat and Republican.<br> Everybody would love them.<br> - Was he always like that?<br> - No. No, he drank a little.<br> He wasn't too dependable,<br> but it was only a pathetic hint of<br> frailty in a wonderful, glowing man.<br> That appeals to a lot of us.<br> It did to me. I was so young.<br> His weaknesses seemed touching and<br> sweet. They made me love him more.<br> One day, he was walking with our son.<br> He let go of his hand.<br> There was traffic. He looked<br> the other way. The boy was killed.<br> Ever since then, Frank has acted<br> like a murderer.<br> Guilt and repentance<br> and all that goes with it.<br> But worse than that, he's shunned<br> any responsibility like the plague.<br> It covered a pretty wide range.<br> Everything from not wanting<br> any more children to...<br> It must sound ludicrous to anyone<br> who hasn't lived through it.<br> It got to the point that he wouldn't<br> pick out a coat or suit by himself.<br> I don't know where to begin<br> to apologise, Mrs Elgin.<br> You can begin<br> by not calling me Mrs Elgin.<br> - And you never left him?<br> - Twice left, twice returned.<br> He's a helpless child.<br> Anyone taking a cab to New York?<br> If he's as helpless as you say...<br> He's not helpless now.<br> He has you, Mr Dodd.<br> You're the only one that can<br> handle him. I didn't know it before.<br> - Then you've learned something.<br> - The man has to be watched.<br> You take the job with waving banners<br> and ten hours later hand it back!<br> He has to be watched? He has to be<br> nursed and guarded, but not by me!<br> I'm going back to New York,<br> to the comfort of a quiet room.<br> I won't have to wonder where he is.<br> He'll be in the strong hands<br> of Bernie Dodd!<br> Can you stand him on his feet?<br> That's where my prayers have gone.<br> To see that holy hour<br> when he can stand alone again.<br> I might forgive you, Mr Dodd,<br> if you can keep him up long enough<br> for me to get out from under.<br> All I want is my own name and<br> a job to buy sugar for my coffee.<br> You can't believe that a woman<br> is crazy-out-of-her-mind<br> to live alone in one room,<br> by herself!<br> - Listen to me!<br> - Why are you holding me?<br> How could you be so angry<br> at someone you didn't even know?<br> Maybe I really wasn't.<br> Maybe I screamed at you to keep<br> myself at an angry distance.<br> No one has looked at me<br> as a woman for years and years.<br> I never knew there was such a woman.<br> Loyal, steadfast.<br> And when I found her...<br> Now I need your answer.<br> Do you think Frank can make it?<br> I don't know.<br> But if he doesn't go through with<br> this show, he'll never work again.<br> - I'm sure of that.<br> - You'll be taking a big chance.<br> They're the only ones worth taking.<br> But I can't unless you stay.<br> Will you?<br> Yes.<br> You kissed me.<br> Don't let it give you<br> any ideas, Mr Dodd.<br> No, Mrs Elgin.<br> It's more thoughtful. He's trying<br> to figure out an approach...<br> - Did you see Cook?<br> - No.<br> He's talking to Watson.<br> I haven't got time now.<br> I've been with the understudy.<br> Do you want to listen?<br> Not now.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - OK. Larry got me some coffee.<br> I'll be out in a minute.<br> You don't have to get out.<br> All you have to do is get some sleep.<br> The understudy will want to get in.<br> I listened to him. He's no good.<br> You'll have to play the matine.<br> Oh, no. Don't stick your neck out.<br> I'm in no mood to cut my throat<br> in public. The understudy stinks.<br> It's not just the matine.<br> You've got to replace me.<br> When you took this job,<br> I promised you no pity.<br> I don't expect any.<br> I'm only warning you. Get rid of me.<br> Let me go back to New York.<br> So you can tell the boys you quit<br> because the part wasn't big enough?<br> Oh, no. If you leave this show,<br> it'll only be for one reason.<br> Because I fire you for being<br> an unreliable, slobbering drunk.<br> I know a lot of people who hire<br> actors. That's what I'll tell them.<br> It's not just this performance.<br> I can do a show for you. I've gone on<br> when I can hardly stand up.<br> It's not when I'm out there<br> that it's bad.<br> This is a matine in Boston. If I do<br> this in New York, where are you?<br> - Where are you?<br> - You talk as if I do it on purpose.<br> I can't help it, Bernie.<br> In between shows and at night,<br> when I start thinking about it...<br> You mean the accident?<br> Georgie told me about it.<br> - It hasn't been easy.<br> - Why didn't you tell me about it?<br> - I don't know.<br> - You knew I wouldn't buy it.<br> I don't buy it. A crazy wife.<br> Yes, you knew I had one.<br> - It was an accident.<br> - It was a crutch.<br> You were getting older, beginning<br> to slip. You looked for excuses.<br> The accident was an excuse.<br> Everybody expects a guy to take that<br> pretty hard. You used it to the hilt.<br> - No, Bernie.<br> - I'm right, and you know it.<br> You're sure of yourself. You don't<br> know what it means to be afraid.<br> You're on top of the heap.<br> Everything's good for you, but wait<br> till you've had a couple of flops<br> and people stop talking about you.<br> You'll get afraid<br> and look for excuses.<br> I'm not blaming you. Just stop lying.<br> Sure, everybody thought<br> it was because of the accident.<br> That's what I wanted them to think,<br> because I was afraid.<br> Even when I was the biggest, I was<br> afraid. I've always been afraid.<br> I don't know why. It was good to find<br> a respectable excuse for failure.<br> I could drink a little more.<br> Nobody blamed me.<br> No, they blamed it on the accident.<br> After I'd milked every tear out of it,<br> I cut my wrists,<br> not deep enough to die,<br> just enough to bleed myself back<br> into the centre of attention.<br> Everybody felt sorry for me again.<br> They understood. Everybody<br> was talking about me and my tragedy.<br> That's the way I wanted it.<br> To keep it that way, I lied.<br> God, how I lied!<br> I even lied about Georgie!<br> You were so right, Bernie.<br> I keep thinking about it.<br> Not about the accident,<br> but how I used it.<br> - Get some rest.<br> - I'll keep on thinking about it.<br> You better not take a chance on me.<br> You better get rid of me.<br> - Bernie...<br> - Shh.<br> - He's got to sleep.<br> - I don't care if he hears me.<br> I talked to Ray Watson in California.<br> He can be here in the morning.<br> I said I'd call him back.<br> - Frank's going to play it.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Don't protect this guy any longer!<br> I'm calling Ray Watson.<br> If you do, tell him to bring<br> a director along with him.<br> THE LAND AROUND US<br> All that valley needs is a few<br> friends to treat it kindly for once,<br> to loan it a plough, some seeds,<br> plenty of care.<br> It'll pay us back.<br> I know it, Joe, but the others<br> will take a lot of convincing.<br> - Western Union.<br> - Yes, come in.<br> - How's it going, Ralph?<br> - Fine, Mr Dodd.<br> Mr Frank's a big man.<br> Positive honour to work for him.<br> - Have you been out front?<br> - Yeah.<br> Opening night in New York.<br> The world's most useless man.<br> - How's Frank?<br> - OK. How's it been back here?<br> He was a little uneasy<br> with the curtain going up so late.<br> If the first few rows<br> had the balcony's manners,<br> what a wonderful world this would be.<br> It was sweet of you<br> to send these wires.<br> - Who told you?<br> - I guessed. How many did you send?<br> - Nine or ten. You?<br> - Five or six.<br> Where did you get the names?<br> The Lambs' Club.<br> Good, good.<br> Why don't you go out front?<br> Not me. I don't sit with the critics.<br> I hear very well right from here.<br> That's the advantage<br> of an on-stage dressing room.<br> Keep quiet!<br> That's the disadvantage.<br> Larry's right. From now on,<br> it's his show. I'm just a visitor.<br> - Depressed, aren't you?<br> - Depressed and mean.<br> It's been a long nine weeks.<br> A job is home to a homeless man.<br> Now the job is finished.<br> Where do I go from here?<br> Georgie, five weeks ago<br> I kissed a woman, a married woman.<br> Now I know I love her.<br> I don't know where to turn.<br> - Close to you like this...<br> - Bernie...<br> I waited.<br> - Are you going to leave him?<br> - Bernie...<br> You told me you prayed to see him on<br> his feet again so you could get out.<br> Let me show you something.<br> Looks to me like he's made it.<br> What about you?<br> - Are you leaving him?<br> - Don't you think that can wait?<br> No, it's been on my mind<br> since that morning in Boston.<br> If I could make you understand...<br> Not now, Bernie. Not now.<br> First-act curtain. I've got to make<br> the dressing room tour.<br> - I thought you were out front.<br> - Just came back.<br> You hit it tonight. It's good.<br> I can handle this. Go have a smoke.<br> You know something, that's work.<br> It sounded wonderful back here.<br> I messed up a couple of spots.<br> Nobody noticed.<br> - You'd better touch up the grey.<br> - Make me look two weeks younger.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - Good. How are they liking it?<br> I only know what I read<br> in the papers. They came in late.<br> - As long as they don't leave early.<br> - Frank...<br> A lot of things are said<br> in the heat of the day.<br> Accept my apologies.<br> Those things can happen. Naturally,<br> you include my wife in your apology.<br> Of course. That includes you, too.<br> Then start by taking your hat off.<br> You're not at a smoker, Mr Cook.<br> This is the first kind word you've<br> had for us. I think I know why.<br> You'd like me to sign a contract<br> before the papers come out<br> so you can get me<br> for half what I'm worth.<br> You'll just have to take my word.<br> I have been thinking<br> of contractual arrangements,<br> but that's not why I came back.<br> I'm having some people for supper,<br> and I just wanted to invite you.<br> And you, Mrs Elgin.<br> Thanks. I'll drop by<br> if I'm not too tired.<br> - Good. Hope to see you.<br> - Yeah.<br> Excuse me, Mrs Elgin.<br> We'll be looking for you.<br> Thank you.<br> - Fine performance.<br> - Thank you. They got you trapped!<br> - Don't learn the piano.<br> - Just Chopsticks.<br> - Great performance.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Have you seen Georgie anywhere?<br> - She was here a minute ago.<br> There you are, dear.<br> I only lost about half of it.<br> Now is as good a time as any<br> to say thanks to both of you.<br> For what?<br> If it hadn't been for you,<br> Ray Watson would be here now,<br> looking for a coffee spoon.<br> Frank, there are as many reasons<br> for drinking as there are drinkers.<br> There are only two reasons<br> why a drinker stops.<br> He dies or decides to quit<br> all by himself.<br> I'm not sure I have.<br> I faced a crisis up in Boston<br> and got away with it.<br> Just about anybody can face a crisis.<br> It's everyday living that's rough.<br> I'm not sure I can lick it,<br> but I think I got a chance.<br> The point is, Georgie, what about us?<br> Don't go, Bernie. You're involved.<br> There's only one thing more obvious<br> than two people gazing at each other,<br> and that's two people avoiding it.<br> Frank, I didn't want to bring up<br> any of this tonight.<br> But you did, so let's have<br> the whole truth.<br> I married you for happiness.<br> Yours and mine.<br> If necessary, I'll leave you<br> for the same reason.<br> I can't guarantee you that happiness.<br> The rest of the whole truth is that<br> it was as much my fault as yours.<br> Bernie accused me of wanting you<br> completely dependent,<br> of wanting to control your life.<br> I denied it, of course, but I think<br> there's an element of truth there.<br> I don't want to run that risk again.<br> No, you're right.<br> This is something<br> I've got to work out for myself,<br> with you or without you.<br> Whether the show is a hit<br> or a flop is beside the point.<br> I've got to find myself,<br> whether it's in one room or five.<br> I don't think there's any point in us<br> torturing each other any longer.<br> You two talk it over. I'll go home.<br> But, Georgie, don't dismiss<br> what we had together.<br> I gave you ten of the roughest years<br> anybody ever spent outside<br> of a concentration camp.<br> It could be more of the same.<br> That was quite a little speech.<br> I'm still giving a performance.<br> This time there's a difference.<br> At least I know it's a performance.<br> I know it's gratifying<br> to be wanted and needed,<br> but not for every minute<br> of every day.<br> Remember that for years he's been<br> a leaner. You said so yourself.<br> - Pretty tune, isn't it? Remember it?<br> - Yes. Yes, I do.<br> I made a record of it once.<br> Bernie, I...<br> I'm always running out of cigarettes.<br> - You smoke too much.<br> - And you're impertinent.<br> But you're loyal and steadfast<br> and devoted.<br> I like that in a woman.<br> - Have you seen Frank anywhere?<br> - He just left, Mrs Elgin.<br> - Here you are.<br> - About time!<br> - How are they?<br> - I didn't read them.<br> - Here's The Times and Tribune.<br> - Thanks, Larry.<br>
