Help me!<br> Help me!<br> No, no! I can't move!<br> Help me, please!<br> I can't move!<br> Help me! Help!<br> Dress the child and<br> come to my study.<br> Betty.<br> Betty!<br> Betty?<br> Miss Williams.<br> Mrs. Griggs, Reverend Parris asks<br> that the doctor come at once.<br> - Betty's gone sick. She can't wake.<br> - Can't she?<br> The doctor's gone to the Putnam's.<br> Their Ruth can't wake either.<br> I fear there be no<br> medicines for this.<br> I have seen nothing<br> like it before.<br> There be no fever...<br> ...nor wound...<br> ...and yet she sleeps.<br> Oh, dear Lord.<br> My Betty is the same.<br> - The same?<br> - Only, her eyes are closed.<br> It's the devil, isn't it?<br> The devil is taking hold of them.<br> Oh, Goody Putnam...<br> Doctor, I beg you. She is my last,<br> my only. I cannot lose her.<br> I shall do all I can, Goody Putnam.<br> But this may be a sickness<br> beyond my art.<br> Thomas!<br> I beg you, we cannot leap to<br> witchcraft for the cause of this.<br> Don't you understand it, sir?<br> There are hurtful, vengeful spirits<br> laying hands on these children.<br> Let you take hold here.<br> Let no one charge you.<br> Declare it yourself.<br> Not yet. I need time.<br> I must think. I must pray.<br> Yes, I agree with Reverend Parris.<br> Good day to you, sir.<br> She still sleeps, then, doctor?<br> - She flies, you know.<br> - Flies? come now, man.<br> - George Collins has seen her.<br> - Seen what?<br> The minister's daughter<br> going over Ingersoll's barn.<br> - Uncle, perhaps you should go tell them...<br> - What should I tell them?<br> That my daughter<br> and my niece...<br> ...were discovered dancing like<br> heathen in the forest?<br> we did dance...<br> ...and let me be whipped if I must be,<br> but they are talking of witchcraft.<br> Betty's not witched!<br> were you conjuring spirits<br> in the forest?<br> - I want the truth now.<br> - We never conjured spirits.<br> Now, hear me, child.<br> You must know that there<br> is a faction in this church,<br> - sworn to drive me from my pulpit.<br> - I know that, sir.<br> And they will destroy me now<br> if my own house...<br> ...turns out to be the center<br> of some obscene practice.<br> Now, I saw someone naked<br> running through the trees.<br> - No one was...<br> - Don't lie to me! I saw it!<br> - It were only sport, uncle.<br> - You call this sport? She cannot wake!<br> Give me upright answer, now.<br> Your name in the town is entirely<br> white, is it not?<br> There be no blush<br> about my name, sir.<br> Why did Goody Proctor discharge you<br> from her service?<br> Because I refused<br> to be her slave.<br> I have heard said<br> that John Proctor...<br> John Proctor and you...<br> My name is good in the village! Elizabeth<br> Proctor's an envious, gossiping liar!<br> Mr. Parris, they're asking for you.<br> You must come down, sir.<br> Betty, my sweet, wake up.<br> Wake up, Betty.<br> Betty!<br> Now, stop this!<br> I know you hear me.<br> Wake up now!<br> Betty!<br> John!<br> Giles and Martha are here.<br> All right.<br> Boys.<br> You've got to come with me<br> to the village, John.<br> Mr. Parris, God help us, has summoned<br> a meeting of the society.<br> What for?<br> What for? Why has that man ever called<br> a meeting except for his own benefit?<br> - I'm explaining it.<br> - Sorry not to have noticed.<br> They're saying his daughter, Betty,<br> has been witched.<br> She sleeps and can't be waked.<br> And the Putnam girl too, they say.<br> - What do you know of this,<br> Mary Warren? - Nothing.<br> I smell mischief here.<br> You must come with me, John.<br> They will look to your judgment.<br> - How can they not wake up?<br> - God knows.<br> You go right ahead, I'll be along.<br> - I'll see you soon, Elizabeth.<br> - Goodbye, Martha.<br> There are still<br> flowers in the field.<br> You might cut some.<br> - It's winter in here yet.<br> - Aye, I'll cut some flowers.<br> Give a penny. Give a penny.<br> Annoy the devil.<br> Goody Osborne, you have<br> no permission to beg here.<br> - I'll wait for you. I fear this.<br> - Fear it? Why?<br> Let us quiet our hearts.<br> You are all aware<br> of the rumors...<br> ...of that spirit come<br> among us out of hell.<br> That hateful enemy of God and<br> all Christian people, the devil.<br> I have invited the Reverend John Hale<br> of Beverly to come to Salem.<br> He has delved deeply...<br> ...into all demonic arts and will<br> surely go to the bottom of this.<br> You may recall in Beverly last year<br> they believed they had a witch...<br> ...until Mr. Hale examined her...<br> ...and decided she was<br> innocent to witchcraft.<br> But it may well be that in Salem<br> he will find signs of Lucifer...<br> ...and if so, you may be sure...<br> ...he will hunt him down.<br> Let us turn our hearts...<br> ...to Psalm 73...<br> ..."Sure God Is Good To Israel. "<br> Sure God is good to Israel<br> You will stop this now!<br> Betty!<br> - What'll we do? They're talking<br> witchcraft! - She means to tell.<br> We've got to tell or they'll<br> be calling us witches.<br> Witchery's a hanging error.<br> Like they done in Boston two year ago.<br> You'll only be whipped for trying<br> to conjure the boys and the dancing.<br> Now, listen to me, Betty, dear.<br> I've talked to your papa<br> and I've told him everything.<br> So there's nothing to<br> be feared anymore.<br> I want my mama.<br> Your mama's dead and buried!<br> I'll fly to her!<br> - Let me fly!<br> - Stop it!<br> - Betty, come here!<br> - Mama! Mama! No! Mama!<br> Why are you doing this?<br> I've told him. He knows now.<br> You drank blood, Abby!<br> You didn't tell him that!<br> You never say that again!<br> You drank a charm to<br> kill John Proctor's wife!<br> - No, Abby. - You drank a<br> charm to kill Goody Proctor!<br> Now, shut it!<br> - She's going to die!<br> - Now, look, you!<br> All of you.<br> We danced.<br> That is all.<br> And mark this...<br> ...let anyone breathe a word...<br> ...or the edge of a word<br> about the other things...<br> ...and I will come to you...<br> ...in the black of the night and<br> I'll bring a pointy reckoning...<br> ...that will shutter you.<br> And you know I can do it.<br> I saw Indians smash my parents'<br> head on the pillow next to mine...<br> ...and I have seen some<br> reddish work done at night.<br> And I can make you wish you<br> never saw the sun go down.<br> - Mama!<br> - No, Betty!<br> - Mama! Mama!<br> - Keep still, you little devil!<br> - Betty!<br> - The devil is here!<br> When she heard the psalm,<br> she ran straight for the window.<br> Mark it for a sign, Mr. Parris.<br> My mother told me that.<br> There is hard sickness here,<br> Giles Corey, so please to keep the quiet.<br> I've not said a word.<br> Nobody can testify I've said a word.<br> Rebecca, I fear we're lost.<br> She cannot bear to hear<br> the Lord's name!<br> That's a notorious sign of<br> witchcraft afoot, Rebecca.<br> What have you done?<br> Goody Nurse, will you go to our<br> Ruth and see if you can wake her?<br> I think she'll wake<br> when she tires of it.<br> I am 26 times a grandma.<br> They can run you bowlegged<br> in their silly seasons.<br> So you've sent for<br> Reverend Hale of Beverly?<br> Only to satisfy all that<br> the devil's not among us.<br> - Mr. Proctor.<br> - John, come help us.<br> We are all at sea.<br> Why not meet before you<br> decided to look for devils?<br> A man cannot pick his teeth without<br> some sort of meeting in this society.<br> Society will not be a bag<br> to swing around your head.<br> Mr. Proctor, you must know by now that<br> the better half of Salem village...<br> Dear friends.<br> Mr. Parris, I think you'd best send<br> Reverend Hale back as soon as he come.<br> This will set us all to arguing<br> again in the society.<br> Let us rather blame<br> ourselves than the devil.<br> Blame ourselves?<br> How can we blame ourselves?<br> I'm one of nine sons. The Putnams<br> have peopled this province.<br> And we have but one<br> child left of eight.<br> Goody Ann, we can only go<br> to God for the cause of that.<br> God?!<br> You think it be God's work...<br> ...that you have never lost a child<br> or grandchild and I bury all but one?<br> Who or what lets us decide what is God's<br> work, Goody Putnam, and what is not?<br> God never spoke in my ear. I can't think<br> of anyone else he done the favor.<br> Your pardon, Rebecca.<br> Is this your mischief?<br> I hear the child goes<br> flying through the air.<br> Oh, she never flew.<br> We were dancing in the woods. My uncle<br> leaped in on us. She took fright, is all.<br> You'll be clapped in the stocks<br> before you're 20.<br> Oh, John, give me a soft word.<br> - No, Abby, that's done with.<br> - I am waiting for you every night.<br> You cannot. I never gave<br> you hope to wait for me.<br> I have something better<br> than hope, I think.<br> Child.<br> - How do you call me child?<br> - Wipe it out of mind, you must.<br> I'll not be coming<br> for you more.<br> You're surely sporting with me.<br> You know me better.<br> I know how you sweated like a<br> stallion whenever I'd come near you.<br> I saw your face when she put<br> me out. You loved me then...<br> ...and you do now.<br> Abby, I may think of you softly<br> from time to time.<br> But I will cut off my hand<br> before I reach for you again.<br> We never touched.<br> Aye.<br> But we did.<br> I marvel how a strong man<br> may let such a sickly wife...<br> - Speak nothing of Elizabeth.<br> - She is blackening my name in the village!<br> Telling lies about me!<br> - She's a cold woman and you bend to her!<br> - Do you look for whipping?<br> I look for John Proctor,<br> who put knowledge in my heart.<br> I never knew what<br> pretense Salem was.<br> Christian women and<br> their covenanted men!<br> And all of them<br> boiling in lust!<br> And now you bid me go dead<br> to all you taught me?<br> I know you, John Proctor!<br> You loved me.<br> Whatever sin it is,<br> you love me yet!<br> Dr. Hale.<br> How can the devil be here?<br> we love God.<br> - It's Mr. Hale, John.<br> - I know who it is. Can I help you?<br> I thank you.<br> Heavy books.<br> Well, they must be.<br> They're weighted with authority.<br> I'm John Proctor, Mr. Hale.<br> You have afflicted children?<br> My children's healthy<br> as bull calves, sir.<br> Like all the other children<br> in this village.<br> Where is my wood? My contract provides<br> I be supplied with all of my firewood.<br> There are wheels within<br> wheels here, Mr. Hale.<br> - I hope you'll not forget that.<br> - That 6 pound is part of my salary!<br> Salary's 60 pound...<br> - I am a graduate of Harvard college.<br> - I am well-instructed in arithmetic!<br> I cannot fathom you people!<br> I can never offer one proposition<br> but I face a howling riot of argument!<br> I've wondered if the devil<br> be in it somewhere.<br> Welcome to Salem.<br> Mr. Hale!<br> Good to see you.<br> Well, I see you've<br> come well-prepared.<br> - This is Thomas Putnam.<br> - How do you do?<br> Allow me, sir.<br> This is my wife, Goody Ann.<br> Will you come to our Ruth? Her soul<br> seems flown away. Will you come to her?<br> Aye, I'll come directly.<br> And you must be Rebecca Nurse.<br> And Mr. Nurse?<br> You know me?<br> No, but you look as such<br> a good soul should.<br> All of us in Beverly have heard<br> of your great charities.<br> There is prodigious danger<br> in seeking loose spirits.<br> I fear it.<br> - Francis.<br> - Mr. Hale.<br> I go to God for you, sir.<br> I hope you do not mean<br> that we go to Satan here.<br> I wish I knew.<br> I hear you be a sensible man,<br> Mr. Hale.<br> I hope you'll leave<br> some of it in Salem.<br> Our child cannot wake, sir.<br> She lies as though dead.<br> And this one cannot<br> bear the Lord's name.<br> It's a sure sign of witchcraft.<br> No, no, Mr. Putnam. We must not<br> look to superstition in this.<br> The marks of the devil<br> are as definite as stone.<br> What book is that?<br> What's there, sir?<br> Here is all the invisible world.<br> In these books the devil stands<br> stripped of all his brute disguises.<br> Here are all your familiar spirits,<br> your incubi and succubi.<br> Your witches that go by land,<br> by air and by sea.<br> Have no fear now.<br> We shall find him out<br> if he's among us.<br> And I mean to crush him utterly<br> if he has shown his face.<br> Here is my niece, Abigail.<br> I'd like to examine your Ruth<br> before I say more.<br> Mr. Hale, I've always wanted<br> to ask a learned man...<br> ...what signifies the reading<br> of strange books?<br> Many a night I've found her in a corner<br> reading of a book. Not the Bible, either.<br> - Who?<br> - Martha, my wife.<br> I'm not saying the devil's<br> touched her, but mark this:<br> Last night I tried and tried<br> but could not say my prayers.<br> Then she closed her book<br> and walked out of the house.<br> And suddenly, mark this,<br> I could pray again.<br> The stoppage of prayer.<br> We'll discuss that.<br> Mr. Hale, this way.<br> Was there no warning<br> of this affliction?<br> Do you recall any disturbance<br> before it struck?<br> Any unusual behavior?<br> Mr. Hale.<br> Mr. Parris.<br> I did discover my niece...<br> ...with a number of her friends,<br> dancing in the forest.<br> - You permit dancing?<br> - No, no. It was secret.<br> - Mr. Parris' slave has knowledge of<br> conjuring. - Now, that may not be true.<br> Abigail, you must tell<br> me about this dancing.<br> - Common dancing is all it is, sir.<br> - When you are dancing, is there a fire?<br> Why?<br> There was a fire.<br> They were boiling something.<br> - Lentils and beans!<br> - Was anything moving?<br> - That jumped in. We never put that in.<br> - What jumped in?<br> I must see these other girls.<br> Who are they?<br> I want their names.<br> Someone called the devil<br> in that forest.<br> Who was it led you to<br> dance around the fire?<br> You can save yourselves<br> if you tell me who it was.<br> Was there one among you<br> who drank from the kettle?<br> Was there perhaps<br> a casting of spells?<br> Was there?!<br> Not I!<br> It wasn't me, I swear it!<br> These two children<br> may be dying! Who?!<br> - Tituba.<br> - I knew it!<br> - Tituba!<br> - Come out now!<br> She made me do it!<br> She made Betty do it!<br> - Tituba no do bad thing!<br> - She made me drink blood!<br> - You drank blood?<br> - My baby's blood!<br> Who murdered my babies?<br> I want their names!<br> Who are they?!<br> Why can the girls not wake? Did you<br> send your spirit out to silence them?<br> I love me Betty.<br> - Hang that bitch!<br> - No! Not Tituba!<br> You've conjured her to be silent,<br> have you not?<br> She beg me conjure.<br> She begged me make charm.<br> She lies!<br> She sends her spirit into me in church!<br> She makes me laugh at prayer!<br> - She's often laughed at prayer.<br> - She comes into me when I sleep.<br> - She makes me dream corruptions!<br> - Why you say bad thing, Abby?<br> Some nights I wake...<br> ...and I find myself...<br> ...standing naked in the open doorway<br> without a stitch on my body!<br> And she makes me do that...<br> ...singing her damn Barbados songs,<br> tempting me!<br> Tituba, when did you compact<br> with the devil? Tell me!<br> I don't. I don't compact<br> with the devil.<br> Tell or I will beat you<br> to your death!<br> I tell!<br> I tell him!<br> I tell him.<br> I tell him.<br> I don't desire...<br> I don't desire to<br> work for him.<br> Then you saw him.<br> You poor woman.<br> He has you by the throat this<br> very moment, doesn't he?<br> Tituba, I'm going to break his<br> grip on both of you.<br> I'm going to pry open<br> the hands of Lucifer.<br> You would be a good Christian<br> woman once again?<br> - Aye, sir, a good Christian woman.<br> - You do still love God?<br> - I love him with all my being.<br> - In God's holy name...<br> - ... and to his glory...<br> - To his glory.<br> ...open yourself, receive his cleansing<br> light within you. You want that?<br> - I want that light. Save me, Mr. Hale.<br> - I will, if you open your heart to me.<br> When the devil comes to you,<br> does he bring other people?<br> - Sarah Good? Does he bring Goody Good?<br> - Are they men or women?<br> - I couldn't see, it was dark!<br> - You saw him, why not others?<br> They was talking<br> and running around!<br> - Are they Salem witches?<br> - I believe so. Yes, sir!<br> I will protect you.<br> - The devil can never overcome<br> a minister. - I know that, sir.<br> Tituba, God put you in our hands<br> to help cleanse this village.<br> You are God's eyes.<br> Now, face God and speak utterly.<br> Who came to you with the devil?<br> Two? Three? Four?<br> - Was Sarah Good with him, or Osborne?<br> - Their names, their names!<br> - How many times he bid<br> me kill you! - Kill me?<br> "Rise up, Tituba, and cut that man's<br> throat!" That's what him tell me.<br> I said, "No, devil.<br> I don't hate that man. "<br> Him say, "Tituba, you work for me.<br> I make you free.<br> I give you pretty<br> dress to wear...<br> ...and I put you way up<br> high in the air...<br> ...and you going flying back<br> home to Barbados. "<br> And I say, "No, devil, you lie!"<br> And then...<br> ...him come to me...<br> ...one stormy night and him say,<br> "Tituba, look!<br> I has white people belong to me. "<br> And I look.<br> I look.<br> And there was Sarah Good!<br> I knew it! Bless you, Tituba!<br> - Aye! And Goody Osborne!<br> - I knew it!<br> They were midwives to me three times<br> and my babies shriveled in their hands!<br> I want to open myself!<br> I want the light of God!<br> I want the sweet love of Jesus!<br> I did dance for the devil!<br> I saw him!<br> I wrote in his book!<br> I go back to Jesus!<br> I kiss his hand!<br> I saw Sarah Good with the devil!<br> I saw Goody Osborne with the devil!<br> I saw Bridget Bishop<br> with the devil!<br> - I saw Goody Howe with the devil!<br> - She speaks!<br> I saw Goody Good!<br> I saw Goody Osborne!<br> I saw Goody Barrow<br> with the devil!<br> Hallelujah!<br> Glory be to God!<br> It is broken, they are free!<br> Where's the marshal?<br> Arrest Sarah Osborne!<br> Sarah Good in a jail.<br> Would you believe a court would ever<br> bother to jail that silly old turtle?<br> John!<br> Giles!<br> News from the village.<br> There were six more accused today.<br> - More mischief here, Giles.<br> - The town's gone wild, I think.<br> They've sent to Boston for the deputy<br> governor to come and take charge.<br> That's Danforth. He'll bring<br> some sense to it. That's good news.<br> Judge Hathorne condemned<br> 14 more to the jail last night.<br> And promised hanging<br> if they don't confess.<br> - Confess? To what?<br> - Bewitching the children.<br> Abigail Williams suffers<br> most of all, he says.<br> Save my cider.<br> I'll go home now<br> and tell Martha.<br> I'm thinking if the<br> crop comes good...<br> ...I'll buy Joseph ward's heifer.<br> - How would that please you?<br> - Aye, it would.<br> I mean to please you, Elizabeth.<br> It would be well if<br> you went to Salem.<br> Abigail told you it had naught to do<br> with witchcraft, did she not?<br> They say Ezekiel Cheever's clerk<br> of the court now. Can you not tell him?<br> God forbid you keep that<br> from the court, John.<br> - A wonder they do believe her.<br> - But they do.<br> Mary Warren...<br> ...says that where Abigail walks the<br> crowds part like the sea for Israel.<br> I think you must go at once.<br> I would go tonight, John.<br> - Will you?<br> - I will think on it.<br> - You cannot keep it.<br> - I say I will think on it.<br> How will I prove what<br> she told me, Elizabeth?<br> We were alone together.<br> I've no proof of what she said.<br> You were alone with her?<br> For a moment, alone, aye.<br> Then it is not as<br> you told me.<br> A moment.<br> There were others close by.<br> - Do as you wish, then.<br> - I'll not have your suspicion anymore.<br> No, John, if it were not Abigail that you<br> must go to hurt, would you falter now?<br> - I think not. - You'll not judge<br> me more. I forgot Abigail.<br> - And I. - Spare me.<br> You forget and forgive nothing.<br> In this seven months<br> since she has gone,<br> I've not moved without<br> I think to please you.<br> But a funeral still marches<br> around your heart.<br> You're not open with me.<br> You saw her with a crowd, you said...<br> - I'll plead my honesty no more.<br> - John, I'm only...<br> No more!<br> I should've roared you down when<br> first you told me your suspicion...<br> ...but like a Christian, I confessed.<br> But you're not God, Elizabeth!<br> Let you look for some<br> goodness in me.<br> And judge me not.<br> The magistrate sits in your<br> heart that judges you.<br> I never thought you but a good man, John.<br> Only somewhat bewildered.<br> Oh, Elizabeth.<br> Your justice would freeze beer.<br> - Judge Hathorne.<br> - Judge Danforth.<br> - Judge Sewall.<br> - Sir.<br> - Mr. Parris.<br> - Your Honor.<br> - Mr. Hale.<br> - Judge.<br> The selectmen.<br> Thomas Putnam.<br> The afflicted girls, sir.<br> I assure you, gentlemen...<br> ...that His Majesty's Government<br> is now determined...<br> ...that the devil<br> shall not rule over<br> one single inch of<br> Massachusetts!<br> And if indeed he has come...<br> ...here in Salem is where<br> we shall dig him out.<br> Provided every precaution<br> be taken...<br> ...to guard against the testimony<br> of distracted persons...<br> ...and, of course, the mad.<br> Indeed, Judge Sewall.<br> Bring in Sarah Osborne!<br> Now, Sarah Osborne,<br> here is Sarah Good...<br> ...who has confessed to witchcraft<br> and will not hang.<br> I bid you follow her example.<br> She testifies that when the devil<br> came to her, you were in his company.<br> There they stood, big as life.<br> Him and her.<br> And Osborne writing her name in his<br> book with her own red blood!<br> Your Honors, I never<br> see the devil in my life.<br> But I can dance as<br> fast backwards...<br> ...as he can forward!<br> Sit down, I tell you!<br> - Sit her down!<br> - Let go of me!<br> You must stop your funning.<br> You must give up your stories!<br> You bring me to harm!<br> Do you hear me? You bring me to harm!<br> Stop hurting me,<br> Goody Osborne!<br> Help me, Judge Danforth!<br> - What are you doing to these girls?<br> - What do you mumble to make them so sick?<br> I was only saying my commandments.<br> I hope I may say my commandments!<br> Let her recite her<br> commandments.<br> Your Grace, I may only say<br> my commandments outdoor.<br> There are 10 commandments.<br> Do you know any?<br> Help me!<br> You have lied to the court.<br> I say, you have lied to the court.<br> Have you not?<br> I'm innocent to witch.<br> The devil knows that!<br> "Then Nebuchadnezzar the king<br> was astonished...<br> ...and rose up in haste<br> and spake and...<br> ...said unto his counselors:<br> "Did not we cast three men bound<br> into the midst of the fire?"<br> She's been to the court.<br> Get out of my garden,<br> you filthy beast!<br> Whose goat is this?<br> Take your hands off my goat!<br> And curb your wicked tongue!<br> Take your goat and get out!<br> The devil take you all!<br> All of you be damned!<br> You are arrested on<br> suspicion of witchcraft.<br> Any compact you have made<br> with the devil...<br> This man is full of spite!<br> I am no witch!<br> His goats were eating my food!<br> These girls are mad!<br> I warned you once before, Proctor.<br> That's my lumber.<br> You're in my bounds!<br> My land's always run up through<br> the forest and I haven't sold any.<br> It is clear in my<br> grandfather's will.<br> Your grandfather damn near<br> willed away my north pasture!<br> But he knew I'd bite his arm<br> if he tried it.<br> Good morning!<br> Morning, Mr. Putnam.<br> Order!<br> Now, Ruth Putnam, when<br> did you last see Mr. Jacobs?<br> He come to me two night<br> past when I was abed.<br> But, Ruth, you are mistaken.<br> You know me.<br> I am Mr. Jacobs, your neighbor.<br> I have 600 acres<br> next to theirs.<br> She has known<br> me all her life.<br> He come through my window.<br> Then he lay down upon me.<br> I could not take breath.<br> His body crush<br> heavy upon me.<br> And he say in my ear:<br> "Ruth Putnam, I will have your life<br> if you testify against me in court. "<br> What say you to this charge,<br> Mr. Jacobs?<br> But, Your Honor...<br> ...I must have these<br> sticks to walk with.<br> How may I come<br> through a window?<br> But you could have sent out your spirit<br> through a window, could you not?<br> But how may my spirit<br> go out of my body?<br> There's a black man whispering<br> at his shoulder.<br> Ruth Putnam has<br> informed me...<br> ...that there is a black man whispering<br> in your ear at this very instant.<br> He's there!<br> He's whispering, I see him!<br> - I see him. I see him.<br> - Do you see him?<br> A black man!<br> The devil is here!<br> - How dare you mock them, Martha Corey?<br> - What else are fools good for?<br> How do you dare go to Salem again,<br> when I forbade you?<br> No!<br> Don't hurt me!<br> I am sick, pray,<br> hurt me not!<br> Get in the house!<br> Go on!<br> I made a gift for you today,<br> Goody Proctor.<br> Thank you.<br> It is a fair poppet.<br> We must all love<br> each other now.<br> Go on in.<br> What ails you, child?<br> Oh, Mr. Jacobs will hang!<br> - Hang?<br> - Aye.<br> And Goody Osborne too.<br> - The deputy governor will permit it?<br> - He must.<br> But not Sarah Good.<br> She will only sit in jail some time,<br> for Sarah Good confessed, you see.<br> I am amazed you do not see<br> the weighty work we do.<br> The devil is loose<br> in Salem, Mr. Proctor.<br> We must discover<br> where he's hiding.<br> So I'll be gone every<br> day for some time.<br> - I am an official of the court now.<br> - I'll thrash the devil out of you!<br> I saved her life tonight!<br> I am accused?<br> You were somewhat mentioned.<br> But I told the court...<br> ...I never seen no sign you ever<br> sent your spirit out to hurt no one...<br> - ... and they dismissed it.<br> - Who accused me?<br> I am bound by law.<br> I cannot tell.<br> Go to bed, Mary.<br> I'll not be ordered to<br> bed no more, Mr. Proctor.<br> I am 18 and a woman,<br> however single.<br> Do you wish to sit up?<br> Then sit up.<br> I wish to go to bed.<br> Good night, then.<br> Good night.<br> The noose is up.<br> There'll be no noose.<br> Abigail wants me dead, John.<br> You know it.<br> Thank you, my dear.<br> God bless you, child.<br> I come to tell you to think on<br> what to do to save yourself.<br> You'll say you cannot<br> see spirits anymore.<br> And you will never<br> cry witchery again.<br> I know you must speak so, John.<br> I understand.<br> But my spirit's changed entirely.<br> I suffer now.<br> It's the truth, John!<br> Look!<br> The bite your wife gave me<br> is not yet healed.<br> - My wife?<br> - Saturday...<br> ...she come to my bed in the<br> night and bite my breast.<br> My wife has not left<br> the house this month.<br> Why must she leave the house<br> to send her spirit on me?<br> Don't George Jacobs come jabbing<br> at me with his walking sticks?<br> Feel the lumps he give<br> me only last night.<br> George Jacobs is<br> locked up in the jail.<br> And thank God he is!<br> They'll hang him.<br> - And he prays! He prays in jail!<br> - May he not pray?<br> And torture me at night while<br> he's praying! Hypocrite!<br> They all are. Thank God I have the<br> power to cleanse the town of them!<br> Hear me.<br> If ever you cry witch against my wife,<br> it will be the end of you.<br> I will not have her condemned.<br> I am but God's finger, John.<br> If he would condemn Elizabeth,<br> she will be condemned.<br> You know me.<br> If she is condemned,<br> it will be the end of you.<br> Samuel, I believe you are sometimes<br> not entirely content with us.<br> Am I correct?<br> I must tell you, Thomas.<br> I had not expected so much of our<br> evidence to come from children.<br> - Had you?<br> - I had not.<br> But you cannot doubt the children<br> are painfully attacked.<br> No, I see that plainly.<br> Recall the Gospel, Samuel:<br> "From the mouths of babes shall<br> come the truth. "<br> But it is also this<br> Putnam woman.<br> I wonder if losing her children<br> has not distracted her mind.<br> And Mr. Putnam is in constant disputation<br> with his neighbors over his boundaries.<br> Some tell me<br> he's not honest.<br> Dear friend...<br> ...no court can wait for saints<br> to provide evidence.<br> I shall be scrupulously just.<br> Surely you will rest on that.<br> I never doubted that, Thomas.<br> - Mr. Hale.<br> - Proctor.<br> Good evening to you, sir.<br> - You are Goodwife Proctor?<br> - Aye, sir, Elizabeth.<br> Are you aware your wife's name<br> is mentioned in the court?<br> Our Mary Warren told us.<br> we're entirely amazed.<br> I am a stranger here.<br> I find it hard to draw a clear opinion<br> of them that are accused.<br> So I go tonight from house to house.<br> I come now from Rebecca Nurse's house.<br> Rebecca is charged?<br> God forbid that such a one be charged.<br> But she is mentioned somewhat.<br> Mr. Hale...<br> ...I hope you'll never believe that<br> Rebecca trafficked with the devil.<br> Goody Proctor,<br> this is a strange time.<br> None can any longer doubt the powers<br> of darkness are attacking this village.<br> We have no knowledge<br> in that line, Mr. Hale.<br> I thought, sir, to put some questions as<br> to the Christian character of this house...<br> ...if you'll permit me.<br> We have no fear of questions, sir.<br> Come in.<br> In the book of record<br> Mr. Parris keeps...<br> ...I note that you are come to Sabbath<br> meeting but 26 time in 17 month.<br> Sit down, Mr. Hale.<br> I'll be straight with you.<br> No minister before Parris ever demanded<br> the deed to the house we lend him.<br> Since we build the meetinghouse had<br> pewter candlesticks upon the pulpit.<br> When Mr. Paris came, he preached nothing<br> but golden ones until he had them.<br> When I look to heaven and see<br> my money glaring at his elbows,<br> it hurt my prayer, sir.<br> It hurt my prayer.<br> And your children. How comes<br> it the last is not baptized?<br> Mr. Parris won't lay his hand upon my baby.<br> I see no light of God in that man.<br> But the man's ordained.<br> Therefore, the light of God is in him.<br> What is your suspicion?<br> I hung the door of the church!<br> - That's a good sign.<br> - Maybe we are too hard on Parris.<br> But sure we never<br> loved the devil here.<br> Do you know your<br> commandments, Elizabeth?<br> I surely do.<br> I'm covenanted, sir. There be no mark<br> upon my Christian life.<br> And you, mister?<br> Aye, I'm sure I do.<br> Let you repeat them.<br> - My commandments?<br> - Aye.<br> Thou shalt not kill.<br> Thou shalt not steal.<br> Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's<br> goods nor make graven images.<br> Shalt not take the name<br> of the Lord in vain.<br> Thou shalt have no other gods<br> before me.<br> Thou shalt keep the<br> Sabbath day holy.<br> Thou shalt honor thy father and mother.<br> Thou shalt not bear false witness.<br> Shalt not make<br> any graves...<br> - You said that twice.<br> - I know.<br> - Adultery, John.<br> - Aye.<br> You see, between the two of us, we do<br> know them all. I think it be a small fault.<br> Theology, sir...<br> ...is a fortress.<br> No crack in a fortress<br> may be accounted small.<br> I bid you both good night, then.<br> Mr. Hale?<br> Mr. Hale.<br> I know the children's sickness<br> had naught to do with witchcraft.<br> What?<br> Parris discovered them<br> sporting in the woods.<br> - They were startled and took sick.<br> - Who told you this?<br> Abigail Williams.<br> Abigail told you it had naught<br> to do with witchcraft?<br> - She told me the night you came.<br> - Why did you keep this?<br> I never knew till tonight the world<br> has gone mad with nonsense.<br> I have myself examined Tituba,<br> Sarah Good and 26 others...<br> ...who have confessed<br> to dealing with the devil.<br> Why not, when they must hang for<br> denying it? You ever thought of that?<br> I have a rumor you do not believe there<br> are witches in the world. Is that true?<br> The Bible speaks<br> of witches, so...<br> Sir, I am a good woman.<br> I know it.<br> If you believe that I may only do good<br> work and yet be secretly bound to Satan...<br> ...then I must tell you<br> I do not believe it.<br> You bewilder him.<br> - But you do believe there are witches?<br> - If I am thought one, then no.<br> You surely do not fly<br> against the Gospels?<br> Question Abigail Williams<br> about the Gospels, not myself!<br> They've taken<br> Martha and Rebecca!<br> On what charge?<br> The supernatural murder<br> of Putnam's babies!<br> Rebecca murdered children?<br> Are you still believing this?<br> Remember, until an hour before the devil<br> fell, God thought him beautiful in heaven!<br> I never harmed no one!<br> I never harmed no one!<br> My dear Rebecca!<br> We'll soon have you free!<br> Pity Cheever, not us!<br> He's the one going to hell!<br> Good evening to you, Proctor.<br> All.<br> Cheever.<br> - I've a warrant for your wife.<br> - I know nothing of this. Who charged her?<br> Abigail Williams.<br> For what crime?<br> On what proof?<br> I like not to search<br> a man's house.<br> But, by law, I must enter.<br> Will you hand me any poppets<br> your wife may keep here?<br> I have kept no poppet<br> since I were a girl.<br> This is Mary's.<br> Mary, come down here.<br> Mary!<br> I had my doubts, Proctor.<br> But this is calamity!<br> You see it, sir?<br> It is a needle.<br> What signifies a needle?<br> The Williams girl, Abigail,<br> today she fall to the floor...<br> ...with a needle stuck<br> in her belly!<br> She testified your wife's spirit<br> pushed it in!<br> - Tell how this poppet came to be here.<br> - What poppet is that, sir?<br> This poppet!<br> This poppet!<br> I made that in court and<br> give it to her yesterday.<br> A needle's been discovered<br> inside that poppet.<br> - I meant no harm by it.<br> - You stuck it in yourself?<br> For safekeeping.<br> I must have forgot to take it out.<br> You are certain this be your natural memory?<br> No one's conjuring you to say this?<br> No, sir, I am entirely myself.<br> Ask Abby.<br> Abby sat beside me<br> when I made it.<br> That girl is murder. She must<br> be ripped out of the world!<br> - You heard that, Herrick? "Ripped out. "<br> - Out of my house!<br> And you with him!<br> - You are a broken minister.<br> - I promise you, if she is innocent...<br> If she is innocent?<br> Why is it never wondered if Parris<br> be innocent? Or Putnam or Abigail?<br> Are the accusers always holy? Were they<br> born this morning as pure as God's fingers?<br> I'll tell you what's walking<br> Salem: vengeance.<br> The crazy children are jangling the keys of<br> the kingdom and vengeance writes the law!<br> I will not give my wife<br> to vengeance!<br> I think I must go<br> with them.<br> Mary, there is bread enough for morning.<br> You will bake in the afternoon.<br> - Heed your father. Help him.<br> - Yes, Mother.<br> I'll bring her home soon.<br> Aye, John, bring me soon.<br> Be good, my boys.<br> I will fall like an ocean<br> on that court.<br> Fear nothing, Elizabeth.<br> Let go.<br> Let go, Joseph.<br> I will fear nothing.<br> Ashamed of yourselves!<br> How can you do this?<br> She has children!<br> Don't you touch her!<br> God will never forgive you!<br> - You'll not chain her!<br> - Get your hands off her!<br> I'll kill you!<br> Damn you!<br> In God's name, John, let me stand<br> to my duty. I must chain them all!<br> Help them, Giles!<br> You are coming with me<br> to court tomorrow.<br> You will tell the court how that poppet<br> come here and who stuck the needle in.<br> I cannot charge murder on Abigail.<br> She'll charge lechery on you,<br> Mr. Proctor.<br> - My wife will not die for me.<br> - I cannot do it!<br> That goodness will<br> not die for me, Mary.<br> - I will bring your guts into<br> your mouth! - They'll turn on me!<br> You will tell the court what you know!<br> Make your peace with it!<br> - Peace!<br> - I can't do it!<br> I can't do it!<br> They'll turn on me!<br> Now hell and heaven grapple on our backs<br> and all our old pretense is ripped away.<br> Aye.<br> And God's icy wind will blow.<br> Now, Martha Corey,<br> how did you know beforehand...<br> ...that Goody Wofford's pigs were<br> to die the night of your visit?<br> As you know well, Mr. Hathorne,<br> I have kept pigs all my life.<br> And pigs that is not fed properly is<br> very likely to die! I had suspicions.<br> Suspicions? You predicted the pigs<br> would die! How come you to know that?<br> Mr. Hathorne!<br> I am innocent to a witch.<br> I know not what a witch is.<br> If you know not what a witch is,<br> how do you know you are not one?<br> - Excellency!<br> - Beware that man!<br> We have evidence for the court!<br> The girls are frauds!<br> Mary Warren has come back<br> To tell the truth.<br> She's a liar!<br> Who is this man?<br> - Giles Corey. And a more contentious...<br> - I'm old enough to answer.<br> I am Giles Corey.<br> I have written a deposition which<br> will open up your eyes, sir.<br> This is John Proctor.<br> He has 300 acres.<br> And Francis Nurse, 500 acres!<br> The court is in recess!<br> Your Excellency...<br> ...I never called my wife a witch.<br> I only said she were reading strange books.<br> We mean no disrespect, sir.<br> Disrespect?<br> This is disruption, mister!<br> This is the highest court of the<br> supreme government of the province.<br> Do you know it?<br> Who is this man?<br> His wife's Rebecca Nurse,<br> condemned this morning.<br> Nurse?<br> Indeed.<br> I have only good report of your character.<br> I'm amazed to find you in this uproar.<br> Excellency, we have proof for<br> your eyes. The girls are frauds!<br> Mary Warren, we were told you were sick.<br> What are you about here?<br> She has been striving<br> with her soul, Mr. Parris.<br> She would speak with<br> His Excellency.<br> Beware this man. This man is set<br> and bound to destroy my ministry.<br> You must hear this child.<br> We must do nothing but what<br> justice bids us do, Mr. Hale.<br> What would you tell us,<br> Mary Warren?<br> She never saw no spirits, sir.<br> She'll swear to you none of<br> the other girls ever saw them.<br> And you intend to spread this lie in<br> open court before the whole village?<br> We were sure His Excellency would<br> welcome the truth, as we can prove it.<br> Have you ever seen the devil,<br> Mr. Proctor?<br> No.<br> And there is no desire lurking in your heart<br> to undermine these investigations?<br> No, sir, I come only to save my<br> innocent wife and my friends.<br> What do you make of this?<br> God help me, I cannot say...<br> ...but I'm sure the child<br> must be heard, Thomas...<br> ...or it will surely spread<br> that you've silenced her.<br> Is this the man whose<br> wife is pregnant?<br> Aye, she's the one.<br> Your wife...<br> ...has sent me a claim that<br> she is pregnant now.<br> There be no sign of it.<br> We have examined her body.<br> But if she says she is pregnant,<br> she must be.<br> That woman will never lie,<br> Mr. Danforth.<br> - She will not?<br> - Never, sir, never.<br> You say you have no other purpose<br> than to safeguard her. Very well.<br> The law forbids harm<br> to the innocent child.<br> So if I tell you now that your wife<br> will be safe until she is delivered...<br> ...will you drop this charge?<br> She is saved at<br> least this year.<br> And a year is long.<br> Your purpose is accomplished,<br> mister.<br> Or is your design somewhat...<br> ...larger?<br> - My friends' wives are also accused...<br> - There! He comes to overthrow the court!<br> - I am no lawyer... - The pure<br> in heart need no lawyers.<br> Proceed as you will.<br> And quickly.<br> This is a sort of testament,<br> signed by 91 people.<br> They declare they've known<br> our wives over many years.<br> Never seen no dealings<br> with the devil.<br> - This is an attack upon the court.<br> - Is every defense an attack?<br> All innocent and Christian people<br> are happy for the courts in Salem.<br> These are gloomy for it.<br> I think you must<br> wish to know why.<br> Mr. Cheever.<br> Have warrants drawn for all of these.<br> Arrest for examination.<br> - They've done no wrong. - I have<br> brought trouble on these people.<br> Not if they are of good conscience,<br> Mr. Nurse.<br> You misunderstand, sir.<br> A person is either with<br> this court or against it.<br> There be no road between.<br> This is a new time.<br> A precise time.<br> we live no longer in the<br> dusky afternoon...<br> ...when evil mixed itself with<br> good and befuddled the world.<br> Now, by God's grace, the good folk<br> and the evil entirely separate.<br> I hope you will find<br> your place with us.<br> Mr. Herrick...<br> ...find Mr. Putnam and<br> bring him here to me.<br> This is...<br> ...very well-phrased.<br> You have no legal training?<br> I have the best, sir.<br> I am 33 time in court in my life.<br> And always plaintiff too.<br> Your father tried a<br> case of mine once.<br> Might be 35 year ago, I think.<br> Did he?<br> He never spoke to you of it?<br> No, I'm afraid I cannot recall it.<br> well, that's strange.<br> He give me 5 pound damages.<br> Did he?<br> Well done.<br> Mr. Putnam.<br> We have an accusation by<br> Mr. Corey against you.<br> He states that you prompted your daughter<br> to cry witchery upon George Jacobs...<br> ...so that you might buy up<br> his forfeited land.<br> It is a lie.<br> This man is killing his neighbors<br> for their land!<br> - But where is your proof?<br> - The proof is there.<br> The day his daughter<br> cried out on Jacobs...<br> ...he was heard to say<br> he bid her do it.<br> I have it from an honest man<br> who was there when he said it.<br> And the name of this man?<br> Why...<br> ...I cannot give you his name.<br> Then I shall have no choice but to<br> arrest you for contempt of court.<br> Do you know that?<br> This is a hearing. You cannot clap<br> me for contempt of a hearing.<br> It is a proper lawyer.<br> Very well.<br> Mr. Corey.<br> The court is now in session.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Your Honor, if what he says is true,<br> why won't he tell us this man's name?<br> It is understandable that he<br> conceals the man's name.<br> There is prodigious fear<br> of this court in the country.<br> No uncorrupted man<br> may fear this court.<br> None.<br> Giles Corey...<br> ...you are under arrest<br> in contempt.<br> Now, decide.<br> Either you give me the man's name<br> who accuses Mr. Putnam...<br> ...or you will sit in jail<br> until you be forced...<br> ...to answer our questions.<br> Mr. Proctor, what...<br> I'll kill you, Putnam!<br> I'm not done with you!<br> Remove him.<br> Say no more, John.<br> He means to hang us all!<br> Have no fear, Giles.<br> This will bring you home!<br> Mary Warren's deposition.<br> She swears upon her immortal soul<br> she lied and her friends lie now.<br> They never saw Satan and<br> no witch ever hurt them.<br> That is the truth, sir.<br> Excellency, clearly this goes<br> to the heart of the matter.<br> In God's name, sir, a claim so weighty<br> cannot be argued by a farmer.<br> Send him home and let him<br> return with a lawyer.<br> - Now, look you, sir...<br> - I have signed 17 death warrants!<br> This argument you must let<br> lawyers present to you!<br> For a man of such<br> terrible learning...<br> ...you are most bewildered, Mr. Hale.<br> Do forgive me.<br> I have been 42 year at the<br> bar and were I called...<br> ...to defend these people,<br> I promise you, I should be confounded.<br> Consider, now.<br> In an ordinary crime...<br> ...witnesses are called to<br> prove guilt or innocence.<br> But witchcraft is<br> an invisible crime.<br> Therefore, who may witness it?<br> The witch, of course.<br> And the victim.<br> Now, we cannot expect the witch<br> to accuse herself, can we?<br> Therefore, we may only<br> rely upon her victims.<br> And the children<br> certainly testify.<br> Therefore, what is left for<br> a lawyer to bring out?<br> But this one claims the<br> girls are not truthful.<br> But that is precisely what<br> I am about to consider.<br> What more may you ask of me?<br> Mr. Herrick,<br> bring the children here.<br> - I should like to question Mary.<br> - Will you be silent?!<br> Enter.<br> Children.<br> The Bible damns all liars.<br> Your friend, Mary Warren...<br> ...has given us a deposition stating<br> that she never saw familiar spirits...<br> ...and was never attacked<br> by any manifest of the devil.<br> She claims as well that you<br> never saw these things either...<br> ...and that you are<br> all pretending.<br> Now, it may be that Satan<br> has conquered Mary...<br> ...and sent her here today to<br> distract our sacred purpose.<br> If so...<br> ...her neck...<br> ...will break for it.<br> But if she speak true...<br> ...I bid you all confess<br> your pretense now...<br> ...for a quick confession<br> will go easier with you.<br> Abigail Williams.<br> - Is there any truth in this?<br> - No, sir.<br> The poppet that were discovered<br> in the Proctor house.<br> She claims she made<br> it in the court...<br> ...and that you saw her stick the<br> needle into it for safekeeping.<br> That is a lie, sir.<br> Did you see Goody Proctor's spirit?<br> And did she stab you,<br> as you have charged?<br> Goody Proctor sent her spirit<br> and it stabbed me.<br> If she is lying...<br> ...it can only mean she would<br> see your wife hanged.<br> She would wish that, sir.<br> This child would murder<br> your wife?<br> That is not a child.<br> Mary, tell how she led you<br> to dance in the woods.<br> This man is blackening my name<br> since I came to Salem.<br> what is this dancing?<br> Mr. Parris discovered them<br> in the dead of night.<br> - And they have danced naked.<br> - Naked?<br> when I first arrived,<br> Mr. Parris told me that.<br> - I did not say they were naked.<br> - But she have danced?<br> Aye.<br> Mary Warren.<br> If you will permit me, Excellency.<br> Mary, in the court<br> you would faint...<br> ...when people accused of witchery<br> sent their spirit out to choke you.<br> That were pretense, sir.<br> But your skin turned<br> icy and pale.<br> They are all marvelous<br> pretenders.<br> Then can she pretend<br> to faint now?<br> Why not? If it were all pretense,<br> pretend now.<br> Come.<br> Turn cold, Mary.<br> Faint.<br> - I cannot faint now.<br> - Can you not pretend it?<br> I have no sense of it now.<br> Why?<br> What is lacking now?<br> Is it that we have no<br> afflicting spirit loose...<br> ...but at the trials<br> there were some?<br> I never saw no spirits.<br> Then faint by your own will.<br> Come, do it.<br> I can't!<br> Are you protecting Satan? Confess!<br> You did see attacking spirits!<br> No! I only thought I saw them,<br> but I did not!<br> Your Honor.<br> I heard the other<br> girls screaming...<br> ...and you seemed<br> to believe them.<br> And then the whole world cried<br> "Spirits! Spirits!" and...<br> child.<br> I must ask you to<br> search your heart.<br> Is it possible the spirits you<br> have seen may be illusion only?<br> - This is a base question.<br> - I only ask you to consider...<br> And what shall I consider?<br> Have I seen my blood running<br> out of my flesh or have I not?<br> Is this my reward for risking my life,<br> to be mistrusted and denied?<br> Oh, my child,<br> I do not mistrust.<br> Beware, Mr. Danforth.<br> Do you think yourself so mighty<br> the devil may not turn your wits?<br> What say you?<br> Satan is no respecter of persons,<br> Mr. Danforth. He may corrupt anyone!<br> I feel the power of<br> hell in this room!<br> Oh, Abby, no!<br> A wind!<br> A cold wind!<br> - Your Honor, I freeze!<br> - They're pretending.<br> She is cold as ice, Your Honor!<br> Mary, stop this wind!<br> - Do you witch her?<br> - No.<br> Take back your spirit.<br> Let me go!<br> I cannot do it!<br> Oh, heavenly Father!<br> Take away this torment!<br> - Whore! How do you call heaven?<br> - Proctor, for God's sakes!<br> - It is a whore, Mr. Danforth!<br> - He lies!<br> Mark her now! She'll stab me with<br> a scream, but she is a whore!<br> This will not pass.<br> You will prove this.<br> I have known her, sir.<br> I have known her.<br> In what time?<br> What place?<br> In the proper place,<br> where my beasts are bedded.<br> My dear, good wife saw her for what<br> she is and put her out on the highroad.<br> And being what she is,<br> a lump of vanity...<br> ...she thinks to dance with me on<br> my wife's grave, and well she might...<br> God help me, I lusted!<br> For this is a whore's<br> vengeance now.<br> I place myself entirely<br> in your hands.<br> Do you deny every scrap<br> and speck of this?<br> If I must answer<br> that question...<br> ...I will leave and never<br> come back and I will<br> tell the world that<br> Satan has won Salem!<br> Your Honor.<br> What man will cast<br> away his good name?<br> What look do you give me?<br> I will not have such look!<br> You will not leave this room.<br> Mr. Parris.<br> Go to the jail and bring<br> Goodwife Proctor here.<br> Excellency, this is all a snare.<br> Bring her.<br> Now...<br> ...we shall touch the bottom<br> of this swamp.<br> Your wife, Mr. Proctor,<br> you say is an honest woman.<br> In her life, sir, she have never lied.<br> And when she put this<br> girl out of your house...<br> ...she put her out for a harlot<br> and knew of her a harlot?<br> Aye, sir, she knew<br> her for a harlot.<br> If she tell me, child,<br> it were for harlotry...<br> ...may God spread<br> his mercy on you.<br> Hold.<br> Turn your back.<br> Turn your back.<br> Do likewise.<br> No one may speak...<br> ...or gesture aye or nay.<br> Mr. Cheever.<br> Report this testimony<br> in all exactness.<br> Enter!<br> You will look at<br> me only, Goody Proctor.<br> In my eyes only.<br> We are informed that at one time<br> you dismissed your servant...<br> ...Abigail Williams.<br> Why?<br> For what cause?<br> Need not look at your husband.<br> The answer is in your memory.<br> Why did you dismiss<br> Abigail Williams?<br> She dissatisfied me<br> and my husband.<br> In what way dissatisfied you?<br> - She were...<br> - Look at me.<br> Were she slovenly?<br> Lazy?<br> What was it?<br> Your Honor...<br> My husband...<br> ...is a good and righteous man.<br> He's never drunk or wasting<br> his time at the shovelboard.<br> But I were a long<br> time sick last year.<br> And I thought I saw him turning<br> from me. And this girl...<br> - Look at me.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> What of Abigail Williams?<br> I came to think<br> he fancied her.<br> And so one night I lost my wits, I think,<br> and put her out on the highroad.<br> And did he indeed<br> turn from you?<br> He...<br> To your own knowledge...<br> ...has John Proctor committed<br> the crime of lechery?<br> Answer my question.<br> Is your husband an adulterer?<br> No, sir.<br> Remove her.<br> Elizabeth, I've confessed it.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - I beg you, stop now!<br> - She spoke nothing of lechery.<br> - It is a natural lie to tell!<br> Judge Danforth, I cannot shut my<br> conscience to it! I believe this man!<br> Private vengeancy is working<br> through this testimony!<br> By my oath to heaven,<br> this girl is false!<br> - What is it?<br> - What's there?<br> It's on the beam.<br> Beneath the rafter!<br> Why do you come,<br> yellow bird?<br> But you cannot want<br> to tear my face!<br> Envy is a deadly sin, Mary!<br> This is a black art,<br> to change your shape.<br> - Abby, I'm here!<br> - No, Mary, don't come down!<br> - I'm not hurting her!<br> - Why does she see you up there?<br> - She sees nothing!<br> - "She sees nothing!"<br> - Have you compacted with<br> the devil? - Never.
