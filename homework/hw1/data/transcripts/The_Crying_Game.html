Go slow.<br> Near by that tree.<br> - You gotta loosen my hands.<br> - I can't.<br> Can't? So, you're gonna have<br> to take my dick out for me...<br> Are you? Come on, man<br> I'm gonna wet my pants.<br> Take the fuck out of me<br> I'm dying!<br> I gotta lean forward<br> or dribble all over myself.<br> Can you hold hands for me?<br> - Now, that is worth waiting for.<br> - Hurry up, will you?<br> These things<br> take time, Fergus.<br> It's amazing how the small<br> details take such importance.<br> Now put it back in.<br> - Give us a break!<br> - I can't do it...<br> It's only a piece of meat!<br> Fuck sake! It's got no major diseases!<br> Thank you. I had a case<br> of the clap two years ago.<br> - Crabs in ulster?<br> - Shut up, will you!<br> Furthermore<br> it served pretty well.<br> - Get inside!<br> - I didn't mean to offend you.<br> I'm sorry. I know<br> it wasn't very easy for you.<br> The pleasure was all mine.<br> Oh, no. The pleasure was mine<br> Believe me, all mine.<br> - What the fuck is this?<br> - Nothing. He just took me for a pee.<br> Put the fucking hood on him.<br> - What the fuck is this?<br> - He's just got a sense of humor.<br> When you're on duty keep<br> your fucking mouth shut.<br> Now go and get some sleep.<br> Yeah... get some sleep.<br> Did he talk?<br> Didn't make you laugh?<br> - Here, have some breakfast.<br> - Good morning, Fergus.<br> - So he knows your name?<br> - Yeah, I told him.<br> - Are you over?<br> Come here.<br> - I said come here!<br> - Back in a minute, Jody.<br> You'll have minimum<br> contact with that prisoner.<br> You know why? Because tomorrow<br> we may have to shoot on him.<br> They're giving you trouble, Fergus.<br> It happens.<br> There are two kinds of people<br> those who give and those who take.<br> Take off the hood, man.<br> It's okay. I understand.<br> Don't mind if I prowl along, do you?<br> I take by silence you don't.<br> Two types, Fergus...<br> the scorpion and the frog.<br> Have you heard of them?<br> Scorpion wants to cross the river...<br> but he can't swim. He goes for<br> a frog who can and asks for a ride.<br> The frog says,<br> if I give you a ride...<br> The scorpion replies,<br> I might not be interested...<br> cause if I'd ridden on your back<br> we'd both have drowned.<br> The frog thinks it's not<br> worthwhile and except it.<br> Braves the water and halfway over<br> feels a burning spear on his side.<br> And realizes the scorpion<br> had stung him after all.<br> While they both sink, beneath<br> the waves the frog cries...<br> Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion?<br> Because now we both will drown.<br> The scorpion replies...<br> I can't help it,<br> it's in my nature.<br> - So what's that supposed to mean?<br> - It's what it says.<br> A scorpion does<br> what it is in its nature.<br> - Take off the hood, man.<br> - Why?<br> Cause you're kind.<br> And it's in your nature.<br> - See? I was right about you.<br> - Don't be so sure.<br> - Jody is always right.<br> - Where would you like to be now?<br> - Doesn't matter where.<br> Come on, man...<br> if this shit was all over.<br> - I want a pint in the Rock.<br> - You lack imagination, Fergus.<br> - Think of something more alluring.<br> Like what?<br> Like... having a pint<br> on the Metro.<br> - Having two pints on the Rock.<br> - Having a pint on the Metro.<br> - And Dil having a margerita.<br> - Who's Dil?<br> Special friend.<br> We got simple taste, you and me.<br> - Yeah, the best.<br> - You guys are never gonna break?<br> Do you?<br> We do to our duty<br> and we are finished.<br> - You guys are never finished.<br> - We don't look on it that way.<br> - Often I wonder I would do.<br> - It depends what you believe in.<br> - What do you believe in?<br> - That you guys shouldn't be here.<br> - That simple?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Put that thing back on him.<br> - Ele est com calor!<br> It doesn't matter if he's hot.<br> Just cover that fucker up.<br> You got no feelings, woman!<br> And you... shut your piss!<br> You'll have it for trouble, Fergus.<br> He's a good soldier!<br> I said shut the fuck up!<br> - He believes in the future.<br> - Oh, really?<br> - Is it bad?<br> - Not bad.<br> Women are trouble.<br> Did you know that, Fergus?<br> - I didn't.<br> - Some kinds of women are.<br> She can't help it.<br> Dil... she was no trouble.<br> No trouble at all.<br> - You liked her?<br> - Present tense, please, please.<br> Love her. Wherever she is.<br> I'm thinking of her now...<br> - Would you think of her too?<br> - I don't know her.<br> - I want you to do something for me.<br> - What?<br> - Lf they kill me...<br> - Don't think that way.<br> But they will, as sure as<br> night follows day. They have to.<br> I want you to find her.<br> Tell her I was thinking of her.<br> - See if she's all right.<br> - I don't know her.<br> Take her picture.<br> It's in my inside pocket.<br> - Take the whole lot. I won't need.<br> - Told you not to talk that way.<br> Go to Millies Hair Salon<br> in Spittalfields...<br> Take her to the Metro<br> for margerita.<br> You don't tell her who you are.<br> Just tell her I was thinking of her.<br> - Stop it. - that Jody loved her.<br> Volunteer!<br> We need you inside.<br> We've heard a word.<br> Having the guys putting...<br> track on the Booz<br> and began to talk.<br> You're gonna have<br> to do it in the morning.<br> - Are you okay by that?<br> - I'm a voluteer, am I not?<br> Good, cause you made me<br> doubt of it the past few days.<br> - You are the only one?<br> - Shut up, Jude.<br> You'd better get some<br> sleep tonight, Fergus.<br> - Peter.<br> - What?<br> I ask permission to guard<br> the prisoner tonight.<br> You're crazy! Don't let it be.<br> Shut the fuck up, Jude.<br> Why you wanna do that?<br> It would make me<br> feel better about it.<br> - Sure about that?<br> - Yeah, I'm sure.<br> Ok. You are a good man,<br> Fergus.<br> Don't.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Help me.<br> How can I?<br> I don't know. I don't know.<br> Just help me...<br> Give me a cigarrette.<br> I don't even smoke.<br> It's over.<br> It's the right thing to do.<br> - Go sleep now.<br> - I don't want to sleep.<br> - Tell me something.<br> - What?<br> - A story.<br> - Like the one about the frog?<br> And the scorpion. No. No.<br> Tell me anything.<br> - When I was a child...<br> - Yeah...<br> I thought as a child.<br> But when I became a man...<br> - I put away childish things.<br> - What does that mean?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Nothing?<br> Tell me something,<br> anything.<br> You're not of a lot of use,<br> are you, Fergus?<br> Me?<br> No, I'm not good for much.<br> Come on, stand up.<br> Turn to your right.<br> Step up, turn to your right.<br> Go forward, step up.<br> To your left.<br> I wish to say on behalf of<br> the Irish Republican Army...<br> Leave him, Pe!<br> - Take the hood off, Fergus.<br> - No.<br> I wanna see you, please.<br> Don't make me die like an animal.<br> I'm glad you're doing it.<br> - You know that, Fergus?<br> - Why?<br> Cause you are my friend...<br> - and I want you to go to the Metro.<br> - Stop that talk now.<br> - Hurling is a fast game, isn't it?<br> - The fastest.<br> - Faster than cricket?<br> - Cricket is in the hip. They piss.<br> So if I ran off, there's no way<br> I could beat you, is there?<br> - You won't run.<br> - But what if I did...<br> You wouldn't shoot<br> a brother in the back.<br> Jody!<br> You stupid bastard.<br> - What are you saying?<br> - I said you bastard.
