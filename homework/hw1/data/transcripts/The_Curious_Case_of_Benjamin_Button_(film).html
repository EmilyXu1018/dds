                        What are you looking at, Caroline?<br> -The wind, mom.<br> They say a hurricane is coming.<br> I feel like I'm on a boat...<br> drifting.<br> Can I do anything for you, mom?<br> Make anything easier?<br> Oh, sugar. There is<br> nothing left to do.<br> It is what it is.<br> I'm finding it harder<br> to keep my eyes open.<br> My mouth's full of... cotton.<br> There, there, miss Daisy.<br> You will scratch yourself to ribbons.<br> Do you want any more<br> medication, mother?<br> Doctor said you can<br> have as much as you want.<br> No need for anybody to suffer.<br> A friend told me that...<br> she never had a chance to say<br> goodbye to her mother.<br> I wanted to tell you...<br> how much I'm gonna miss you.<br> Mom.<br> Oh, Caroline.<br> Are you afraid?<br> -I'm curious.<br> What comes next...<br> They built that train<br> station in 1918.<br> Our father was there<br> the day it opened.<br> He said that...<br> a tuba band was playing.<br> They had the finest clockmaker<br> in all of the South<br> to build that glorious clock.<br> His name was<br> Mr Gateau.<br> Mr Cake.<br> He was married to a Creole<br> of Evangeline Parish<br> and they had a son.<br> Mr Gateau was from birth<br> absolutely blind.<br> When their son was old enough,<br> he joined the army.<br> They prayed God would keep him<br> out of harm's way.<br> For months, he did nothing<br> but work on that clock.<br> One day a letter came.<br> Mr Gateau, done for the night,<br> went up alone to bed.<br> And their son came home.<br> They burried him<br> in a family plot<br> where he would be with them<br> when their time came.<br> Mr Cake worked on his clock,<br> laboring to finish.<br> It was a morning to remember.<br> Papa said there were<br> people everywhere.<br> Even Teddy Roosevelt came.<br> It's running backwards!<br> I made it that way.<br> So that perhaps the boys<br> that we lost in a war<br> might stand and<br> come home again.<br> Home to farm,<br> work,<br> have children,<br> to live long, full lives.<br> Perhaps my own son<br> might come home again.<br> I'm sorry if I offended anybody.<br> I hope you enjoy my clock.<br> Mr Cake was never seen again.<br> Some say he died<br> of a broken heart.<br> Some say he went to sea...<br> Excuse me, do you mind<br> if I make a call?<br> Somebody's watching<br> my little boy. -Sure.<br> I hope I haven't<br> disappointed you.<br> You couldn't disappoint me.<br> Well, I...<br> I know I don't have much<br> to show for myself.<br> The suitcase.<br> There's a diary.<br> This?<br> Could you read it to me, dear?<br> -Is this what you wanna do?<br> I tried to read it a hundred<br> different times...<br> Mom, it's not exactly...<br> Just the sound of<br> your voice, darling.<br> It's dated "April 4th, 1985."<br> It says, "New Orleans."<br> This is my last will<br> and testament.<br> I don't have much to leave,<br> few possessions, no money really.<br> I will go out of this world<br> the same way I came in,<br> alone and with nothing.<br> All I have is my story.<br> I'm writing it now<br> while I still remember it.<br> My name is Benjamin.<br> Benjamin Button.<br> And I was born under<br> unusual circumstances.<br> The first world war had ended.<br> I've been told it was an<br> especially good night to be born.<br> We won the war!<br> What are you doing here?<br> -Thomas...<br> I'm afraid she's gonna die.<br> -What?<br> That's enough! All of you!<br> Get away from her!<br> I came as quickly as I could.<br> The streets are filled with people.<br> Thomas, promise me<br> he has a place...<br> Yeah.<br> She gave her life for me.<br> And for that,<br> I am forever grateful.<br> Mr Button...!<br> Thomas!<br> Thomas, wait!<br> Hey, what are you doing there!?<br> What do you have there?<br> The air is sweet.<br> You look very handsome<br> tonigh, miss Queenie.<br> Handsome as I ever seen you.<br> The brown matches your eyes.<br> -Oh, hush!<br> You ain't no slouch yourself.<br> Hambert's back in town.<br> He came home legless...<br> but he home... I know you was<br> sweet on him one time...<br> Sweeter than I shoulda been...<br> -Miss Simone messed herself.<br> Sweet Jesus! She got to stop<br> doing that, or it's diapers for her.<br> -I'll be right there!<br> -C'mon, it's awful nice out here.<br> Come out back for a moment,<br> take your mind off things.<br> What in God's name...!?<br> Oh, the Lord done<br> something here...!<br> I hope I didn't hurt it none,<br> steppin' on it like that.<br> We best leave that for<br> the police. -Oh, baby.<br> I'll go.<br> It's for sure nobody wanted<br> to keep it. Come on, baby.<br> Quennie!<br> -Hold your water!<br> I'll be back.<br> She went and messed<br> herself all over again...<br> Jane Childress, start her a bath.<br> And mind your own<br> business, Mrs Duprey.<br> You'll be messing yourself<br> soon enough.<br> Somebody stole my necklace.<br> OK, Mrs Hollister, I'll be right<br> with you. Go on back upstairs.<br> You are as ugly as an old pot,<br> but you still a child of God.<br> Queenie, she won't go<br> take a bath without you.<br> Mercy... I'll be right there!<br> You just wait right<br> here for me, okay?<br> My sister gave me those pearls.<br> I can't find them anywhere.<br> Somebody's been<br> stealing my jewelry.<br> They are right here,<br> Mrs Hollister. See?<br> Right around your pretty<br> white neck. Now come on.<br> Your heart is strong. You want<br> to avoid any undue stimulation.<br> I trust you ladies will<br> help me out with that?<br> I've never seen anything like it,<br> nearly blind from cataracts.<br> I'm not sure if he can hear,<br> bones indicate severe arthritis.<br> His skin has lost all elasticity<br> and his hands and feet are ossified.<br> He shows all the deterioration,<br> the infirmities not of<br> a newborn, but of a man<br> well in his eighties on his way<br> to the grave. -He's dying?<br> His body's failing him<br> before his life's begun.<br> Where did he come from?<br> -It's my sister's child.<br> From Lafayette. She had<br> an unfortunate adventure.<br> Poor child, he got the worse of it.<br> Come out white.<br> There are places for 'unwanted'<br> babies like these, Queenie.<br> No room for another<br> mouth to feed here.<br> The Nolan Foundation,<br> despite their good intentions,<br> thinks this place is a large<br> nuisance as it is. A baby...<br> You said he don't have long.<br> Queenie, some creatures<br> aren't meant to survive.<br> No, this baby here is a<br> miracle, that's for certain.<br> Just not the kind of miracle<br> one hopes to see.<br> Now listen! Listen up here!<br> We gonna have us a visitor<br> that's gonna be staying<br> with us for a little while.<br> My sister had a child, but she<br> couldn't see right by it. So...<br> He's known as...<br> Benjamin.<br> Benjamin...<br> He's not a well child,<br> so we're gonna have to<br> take good care of him.<br> I had ten children, there's<br> not a baby I can't care for.<br> Let me see him.<br> Oh, God in heaven, he looks<br> just like my ex husband.<br> Look, he's prematurely old.<br> Doctor Rose said he ain't got<br> much more time on this earth.<br> Join the club.<br> Oh, smile!<br> Hambert sends his<br> remembrances to you.<br> Are you right out of your mind?<br> I know you ain't got all the parts<br> it takes to make one of your own,<br> but this ain't yours to keep,<br> it may not even be human kind.<br> Mr Weathers, come back here!<br> Please.<br> "You never know<br> what's comin' for you."<br> It seemed I'd found a home.<br> Is any of this true?<br> You have such a lovely voice.<br> Mom, there's an ancient<br> streetcar token.<br> That clock just kept going,<br> year after year after year...<br> I didn't know I was a child.<br> -Same old crap every day.<br> I thought I was like<br> everyone else there.<br> An old man in a<br> twilight of his life.<br> Stop bangin' that fork. It's used<br> for eating, not for playin' with.<br> And use your napkin,<br> please Mr. Benjamin.<br> Queenie!<br> Hey, boy!<br> I always had a healthy curiosity.<br> What was up the street,<br> or around the next corner?<br> Benjamin! That is dangerous.<br> Come back over here!<br> Stay put, child!<br> I loved her very much.<br> She was my mother.<br> Momma... momma!<br> Some days I feel different<br> than the day before.<br> Everybody feels different about<br> themselves one way or another.<br> But we're all goin' the same way.<br> Just taking different roads<br> to get there, that's all.<br> You're on your own road,<br> Benjamin.<br> Momma, how much longer I got?<br> Just be thankful for<br> what you're given.<br> You already here longer<br> than you supposed to.<br> Some nights,<br> I'd have to sleep alone.<br> I didn't mind. I would listen<br> to the house breathing.<br> All those people sleeping.<br> I felt safe.<br> It was a place of great routine.<br> Every morning at 5:30<br> no matter the weather,<br> General Winslow, US army<br> retired, raised the flag.<br> Mrs Sybil Wagner, once an<br> opera singer of some note,<br> well, she sang Wagner.<br> Alright, c'mon.<br> We gotta put some life into<br> these old sticks for you.<br> get you walkin'.<br> No matter the season, supper<br> was served promptly at 5:30.<br> Mol-asses...<br> -Molasses.<br> Molasses.<br> I learned to read<br> when I was five.<br> My grandfather was<br> a dresser for a famous actor.<br> He brought home every<br> play for me to read.<br> "Kind keepers of my<br> weak decaying age<br> let dying Mortimer<br> here rest himself.<br> Even like a man new<br> haled from the rack.<br> So fare my limbs with<br> long imprisonment.<br> And these gray locks,<br> the pursuivants of death,<br> argue the end of<br> Edmund Mortimer."<br> You thought I was<br> plain ignorant, didn't you?<br> The actor my grandfather worked<br> for was John Wilkes Booth.<br> He killed Abraham Lincoln.<br> You never know<br> what's coming for you.<br> On saturday nights, momma<br> would make me go to church.<br> Benjamin!<br> Amen!<br> What can I do for you, sister?<br> Her parts are all<br> twisted up inside,<br> she can't have little children.<br> Lord, if you could see clear<br> to forgive this woman her sins<br> so she can bear<br> the fruit of the womb.<br> Out damnable affliction!<br> Praise God!<br> Hallelujah!<br> And what's this old<br> man's irrediction?<br> He's got the devil on his back,<br> trying to ride him into<br> the grave before his time.<br> Out, Zebuchar!<br> Out, Beelzebub!<br> How old are you?<br> Seven, but I look a lot older.<br> God bless you.<br> He's seven!<br> Now, this is a man with<br> optimism in his heart!<br> Belief in his soul!<br> We are all children<br> in the eyes of God!<br> We are gonna get you<br> out of that chair.<br> And we're gonna have you walk.<br> -It's all right.<br> In the name of God's glory,<br> rise up!<br> Come on!<br> Come on, man!<br> Now God is gonna see you<br> the rest of the way.<br> He's gonna see this<br> little old man walk<br> without the use of<br> a crutch or a cane.<br> He's gonna see that you walk from<br> faith and divine inspiration alone!<br> Now walk.<br> Don't touch him!<br> Rise up, old man!<br> Rise up like Lazarus!<br> I said rise up!<br> Yes!<br> Say hallelujah!<br> Walk. Walk on.<br> Now, when I look back on it,<br> it was miraculous.<br> But you know the saying:<br> "The Lord giveth and<br> the Lord taketh away."<br> Praise be to the Lord<br> on the highest...!<br> There was so many birthdays.<br> So we wouldn't run out,<br> we would spare the candles.<br> You know I don't like birthdays<br> and I don't like cake.<br> And death was a common visitor.<br> People came and went.<br> You always knew<br> when someone left us.<br> There was a silence in the house.<br> It was a wonderful<br> place to grow up.<br> I was with people who had shed all<br> the inconsequences of earlier life.<br> Left wondering<br> about the weather,<br> the temperature of a bath,<br> the light at the end of the day.<br> For everyone that died, someone<br> would come to take their place.<br> I've been married five times.<br> My first wife and I are captured<br> by neighbor tribe of cannibals.<br> We escaped across the river.<br> My wife, she can't swim,<br> so, sadly, she eaten.<br> My second wife steps<br> on a cobra and dies.<br> It was very bad luck<br> to be married to me.<br> That's Mr Oti. He's an acquaintance<br> of an acquaintance of mine.<br> The next summer I'm captured...<br> -He's a pigmey.<br> ...with six others<br> by Baschiele tribe.<br> They trade us for pigs,<br> shoes and beer<br> to a very strange<br> american man.<br> I hear you're not so old<br> as you looking.<br> You just foolin' everybody.<br> What's the matter,<br> did you get Madjembe?<br> What's madjembe?<br> -Worms.<br> I don't think I have worms.<br> This is just how I am.<br> Come, let's get a cold root beer.<br> I found medication<br> under your pillow.<br> I'm not supposed to.<br> It's dangerous.<br> Who said that?<br> Come on, little man.<br> Hurry up.<br> Halt, please!<br> Then I am in the monkey house<br> at Philadelphia Zoological Park.<br> Three thousand people<br> show up my first day.<br> Look.<br> What's it like living<br> in a cage? -It stinks.<br> But the monkeys,<br> they do some tricks there.<br> I throw a spear...<br> wrestle with Kowali,<br> she is orangutan.<br> When I'm not playing<br> with the monkeys,<br> they want me to run to the bars<br> in my cage, with my teeth.<br> So then what did you do?<br> -Then I leave ZOO.<br> Go here, go there,<br> wander most of the time.<br> You were all alone?<br> -Plenty of time you'd be alone.<br> When you're different like us,<br> it's gonna be that way.<br> But I tell you a little secret.<br> Fat people, skinny people,<br> tall people, white people...<br> they're just as alone as we are.<br> But they are scared shitless.<br> I think about the river<br> I grew up on.<br> It would be nice to sit<br> by my river again.<br> Come. I have an appointment.<br> There's my little man.<br> You ready, sugar?<br> Always ready.<br> Always ready.<br> Filamena, mr Benjamin.<br> It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.<br> -My pleasure, ma'am.<br> You can find your own<br> way home, can't you?<br> Take the St. Charles<br> line to Napoleon.<br> Where in God's name<br> have you been? Get in here!<br> Youre goin' to take my breath<br> away, you know that?<br> Oh Lord, I was so<br> worried about you.<br> It had been the best<br> day of my life.<br> How's her breathing?<br> -Shallow.<br> They're sayin' it will<br> reach us in few hours.<br> I gotta get my baby<br> and take him to my sister's.<br> They say there's nothin' to worry<br> about here in the hospital.<br> Nurses will be right here if you<br> need them. Are you okay?<br> Yeah, I'm okay, reading...<br> I shouldn't be more<br> than an hour.<br> Was there just company?<br> It was just Dorothy leaving.<br> Go on, Caroline.<br> On sundays, the families<br> would come and visit.<br> It was Thanksgiving, 1930.<br> I met the person who<br> changed my life forever.<br> Well, Benjamin...<br> Might I say you are looking<br> strikingly youthful.<br> Good day, Mrs Fuller.<br> A single cane,<br> back straight as an arrow...<br> What elixir have<br> you been drinking?<br> -Thank you, Ma'am.<br> -Grandma, look at me!<br> That was really something!<br> Come on over here, you.<br> This is my granddaughter Daisy.<br> This is mister...<br> I'm afraid, Benjamin, I don't<br> rightly know your last name.<br> Benjamin is fine.<br> I never forgot her blue eyes.<br> Good people, supper is served.<br> Did you know turkeys<br> aren't really birds?<br> -Why do you say that?<br> -They're in the pheasant family.<br> They can hardly fly. Sad, don't<br> you think? Birds that can't fly.<br> I like birds that can't fly.<br> They are so delicious.<br> -That's cruel.<br> -I have something to tell you all.<br> While we're giving thanks<br> for God's blessings...<br> I've had a miracle happen.<br> The Lord saw fit to<br> answer my prayers.<br> What does she mean<br> "answers her prayers"?<br> She's gonna have a baby, silly.<br> That's what my momma said when<br> I was gonna have a baby brother.<br> But he didn't live long.<br> Cause he didn't breathe right.<br> ...when he got his<br> beautiful hind legs<br> just as big God Ngog<br> had promised.<br> You can see that<br> it's five o'clock,<br> because big God<br> Ngog's clock says so.<br> Isn't that something?<br> -Again. Read it again.<br> -Read it again, please.<br> Alright. But afterwards,<br> you must go to bed.<br> I promise.<br> Old Man Kangaroo...<br> Are you sleeping?<br> -Who is that?<br> -It's me, Daisy.<br> -Hi!<br> -Come on!<br> Where are we going?<br> -Come on. Right in here.<br> Here, you light it. -I'm not<br> supposed to play with matches.<br> Don 't be a chicken.<br> Light it!<br> I'll tell you a secret if<br> you'll tell me one. -Okay.<br> I saw my momma<br> kissing another man.<br> Her face was red from it.<br> Your turn.<br> I'm not as old as I look.<br> -I thought so.<br> You don't seem like an old<br> person. Like my grandma.<br> -I'm not.<br> -Are you sick?<br> Well, I heard momma<br> and Tizzy whisper<br> and they said I was<br> gonna die soon.<br> But maybe not.<br> You're odd.<br> You're different than<br> anybody I've ever met.<br> May I? -Okay.<br> What are you doing<br> under there?<br> You come right out here<br> and get back up to bed.<br> It's after midnight!<br> You are not to be playing<br> together. -Yes, ma'am.<br> Not many people experience that.<br> You want me to go on?<br> What about your friend?<br> The tall lady?<br> We're not friends anymore.<br> That's what happens with<br> tall people sometimes.<br> Well... goodbye.<br> I spent a lot of time<br> by myself that year.<br> Hello?<br> -Hi. -I'm moving in today.<br> Welcome. We've been<br> expecting you.<br> Can you please show her up<br> to Mrs Rousseau's old room?<br> I'm sorry, but we usually<br> don't allow dogs in the house.<br> Well, she's old as the hills,<br> she's almost blind.<br> She won't be a<br> bother much longer.<br> Well, alright, as long as she<br> stays out from underfoot.<br> As hard as I try,<br> I can't remember her name.<br> Mrs Lawson, or Mrs Hartford,<br> or maybe it was Maple?<br> It's funny how sometimes the<br> people we remember the least<br> make the greatest<br> impression on us.<br> I do remember<br> she wore diamonds.<br> And she always dressed in fine<br> clothing as if she's going out.<br> Although she never did and<br> nobody ever came to visit her.<br> She taught me<br> to play the piano.<br> It's not about<br> how well you play,<br> it's how you feel about<br> what you're playing.<br> Try this.<br> You cannot help but put<br> yourself into the music.<br> There were many changes. Some<br> you could see, some your couldn't.<br> Hair started growing<br> in all sorts of places.<br> Along with other things.<br> I felt pretty good, considering.<br> Oh, darlin', the pain.<br> -Alright mom, I'll get the nurse.<br> Look at this eye.<br> This is a major hurricane.<br> Not doing too good?<br> Nobody seems to know<br> whether to stay or leave.<br> I'm gonna ride it out.<br> There, that should make<br> things much easier.<br> Have you had a chance<br> to say your goodbyes?<br> My father waited 4 hours for my<br> brother to get here from Boger City.<br> Couldn't go without him.<br> She seems like a sweet woman.<br> -Yeah.<br> I haven't had as much time<br> with her... -Are you busy?<br> -Excuse me.<br> -Sure.<br> Queenie would let me go with<br> Mr Daws to Poverty Point,<br> to watch the boats go<br> up and down the river.<br> These were hard times.<br> Did I ever tell you I was struck<br> by lightning seven times?<br> Once when I was in the field<br> just tending to my cows.<br> My fourt' hand didn't show up.<br> Anybody wanna make 2 $<br> for a day's work around here?<br> What's the matter?<br> Nobody wants to do an honest day's<br> work for an honest day's pay?<br> He never pays.<br> Nobody wants the job?<br> -I do.<br> You got your sea legs, old man?<br> I think.<br> That's good enough for me.<br> Get your ass on board,<br> we'll sure as hell find out!<br> I was as happy as I could be.<br> -I need a volunteer!<br> I would do anything.<br> -Yes, captain!<br> -Scrape off all this bird shit.<br> -Right away, sir.<br> I was actually goin' to be paid for<br> something I would've done for free.<br> His name was<br> captain Mike Clark.<br> He'd been on a tugboat<br> since he was seven.<br> Get movin'!<br> Come here.<br> Could you... still get it up?<br> I do every morning.<br> The old pole? The hard'n?<br> I guess.<br> When was the last time<br> you had a woman?<br> Never. -Never?<br> Not that I know of, sir.<br> Wait a minute!<br> You mean to say, you've been on<br> this earth for how many years,<br> and you never had a woman?<br> Damn! That's the saddest<br> thing I ever heard in my life.<br> Never? -No.<br> Then, by Jesus,<br> you are comin' with me.<br> -What did your father do?<br> -I never met my father.<br> You lucky bastard!<br> All father's gonna do<br> is hold you down.<br> Out on my father's boat,<br> working da two-a-days.<br> This little fat bastard,<br> "tug Irish" they call him.<br> I finally get up the<br> nerves and tell him:<br> "I don't wanna spend da rest of<br> my life on a goddamn tugboat!"<br> You know what I'm sayin'?<br> You don't wanna spend the rest<br> of your life on a tugboat.<br> Absolutely, damn right!<br> And you know what<br> my father says to me?<br> He says: "Who the hell<br> do you think you are?"<br> "What the hell do you<br> think you can do?"<br> I tell him:<br> "Well, if you're askin'..."<br> "I wanna be an artist."<br> He laughs... "An artist?"<br> "God meant for you to work<br> a tugboat just like me."<br> "And that's exactly<br> what you're gonna do."<br> Well, I turned myself<br> into an artist.<br> A tattoo artist!<br> I put on every one<br> of these myself.<br> You have to skin me alive to<br> take my art away from me now!<br> When I'm dead, I'm gonna<br> send him my arm.<br> That one.<br> Don't let anyone<br> tell you different!<br> You gotta do what<br> you're meant to do.<br> And I happen to be<br> a god-damned artist!<br> But you're a tugboat captain.<br> Captain Mike, we're ready<br> for you and your friend.<br> Go, old timer.<br> Break your cherry.<br> Hello, ladies!<br> Hi.<br> He gives me the willies.<br> That is not for me.<br> How are you tonight, grandpa?<br> It was a night to remember.<br> What are you, Dick Tracy or<br> something? I've got to rest.<br> I can't.<br> Thank you. -No, thank you.<br> Have a nice night.<br> -Will you be here tomorrow?<br> -Every night but sunday.<br> It sure made me understand<br> the value of earning a living.<br> Things money can buy you.<br> It's nasty out. Can I offer<br> you a ride somewhere?<br> That's awfully kind of you, sir.<br> My name is Thomas. Thomas Button.<br> -I'm Benjamin.<br> Benjamin... it's a<br> pleasure to know you.<br> Would you like to stop<br> somewhere and have a drink?<br> All right.<br> Evening.<br> -What will it be, sir?<br> -I'll have whatever he's having.<br> A Sazerac for both of us.<br> With whiskey, not brandy.<br> You don't drink, do you?<br> -It's a night for firsts.<br> -How's that? -I've never<br> been to a brothel, either.<br> -It's an experience.<br> -Certainly is.<br> There's a first time for<br> everything. -Sure enough.<br> Your drinks.<br> I don't mean to be rude...<br> but your hands, is that painful?<br> I was born with some form of<br> disease. -What kind of disease?<br> I was born old.<br> -I'm sorry. -No need to be.<br> Nothing wrong with old age.<br> My wife passed away<br> many years ago.<br> I'm so so sorry.<br> She died in childbirth.<br> To children.<br> -To mothers.<br> What line of work are you in,<br> Mr Button? -Buttons.<br> Button's Buttons. There isn't<br> a button we don't make.<br> Our biggest competition is B.F.<br> Goodrich and his infernal zippers.<br> Would you gentlemen<br> like anything else?<br> One for the road, Benjamin?<br> Only if you let me<br> pay for it, Mr Button.<br> So, what line of<br> work do you do?<br> I'm a tugboat man.<br> I enjoyed talking to you.<br> -I enjoyed drinking with you.<br> Benjamin...<br> would you mind if, time to time,<br> I stop by and say hello?<br> Anytime.<br> Good night, Mr Button.<br> Good night, Benjamin.<br> Drive off.<br> Where have you been?<br> Nothing. I met some people<br> and listened to music...<br> Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!<br> Growing up is a funny thing.<br> Sneaks up on you.<br> One person is there<br> and then suddenly<br> somebody else is<br> taking their place.<br> She wasn't all elbows<br> and knees anymore.<br> -Benjamin! Come on.<br> -Okay.<br> I loved those weekends<br> when she'd come<br> and spend the night<br> with her grandmother.<br> Daisy! Daisy!<br> You wanna see something?<br> You gotta keep it a secret.<br> Get dressed.<br> I'll meet you out back.<br> Come on!<br> Can you swim?<br> -I can do anything you can do.<br> Put this on. We gotta hurry.<br> Is he okay? -Captain!<br> Captain Mike!<br> Morning, captain.<br> Can you take us out?<br> Do you know what day it is?<br> -Sunday.<br> You know what that means?<br> It means that I was<br> very drunk last night.<br> You're drunk every night.<br> Is that a girl? -A close friend.<br> I want to show her the river.<br> I'm not supposed to go<br> joy-ridin' with civilians.<br> I could lose my licence.<br> What are you waiting for?<br> She put in for repair.<br> A wounded duck.<br> She's flyin' now!<br> I wish we could go with them.<br> Did you say something, mom?<br> It's getting really bad.<br> Can you hear me, mom?<br> Time just seeped out of me.<br> Things were changing quickly.<br> I don't know how it's possible,<br> but you seem to have more hair.<br> What if I told you that<br> I wasn't getting older,<br> but I was getting younger<br> than everybody else.<br> Well, I'd feel sorry for you.<br> To have to see everybody<br> you love die before you do.<br> It's an awful responsibility.<br> I've never thought about life<br> or death that way before.<br> Benjamin, we're meant to<br> lose the people we love.<br> How else would we know<br> how important they are to us.<br> And one fall day, a familiar<br> visitor came knocking on our door.<br> You wanna go with me<br> to the drugstore?<br> She taught me how to<br> play the piano. -Amen!<br> And she taught me what<br> it meant to miss somebody.<br> Let's go.<br> I had gone to a brothel,<br> I had my first drink,<br> Said goodbye to one friend<br> and burried another.<br> In 1936, when I was coming to the<br> end of the 17th year of my life,<br> I packed my bag<br> and said goodbye.<br> I knew, life being what it was,<br> I'd probably never<br> see them again.<br> Good luck to you, son.<br> -Thanks.<br> -I love you, mom.<br> -I love you too, baby.<br> I want you to say your<br> prayers every night, hear?<br> Be safe!<br> Benjamin!<br> Where are you going?<br> -Off to sea.<br> I'll send you a postcard.<br> From everywhere.<br> Write me a postcard<br> from everywhere.<br> Can you imagine?<br> He sent me a postcard<br> from everywhere he went.<br> Every place he worked.<br> Newfoundland, Baffin Bay,<br> Glasgow, Liverpool, Narvik...<br> He had gone with<br> that captain Mike.<br> Captain Mike had contracted for<br> three years with Moran Brothers<br> Tug and Salvage. The old<br> ship had been refitted<br> with a diesel engine<br> and a new sea winch.<br> We went around Florida<br> and up the Atlantic seaboard.<br> We were a crew of seven now.<br> Captain Mike and me,<br> the cookie, Prentiss Mayes<br> from Wilmington, Delaware.<br> The Brody twins, Rick and Vic<br> who got along fine at sea,<br> but for some reason,<br> once they were on dry land,<br> couldn't stand the sight<br> of each other. -Enough!<br> One in every eight<br> boats never returns...<br> There was John Grimm,<br> who sure fit his name.<br> ...all hands lost at sea.<br> From Belvedere,<br> South Dakota.<br> And Pleasant Curtis<br> from Nashville,<br> who never said a word<br> to anyone, except himself.<br> I wrote him constantly.<br> I told him I had been invited<br> to audition in New York City,<br> for the School of American Ballet.<br> Please stay. Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> You can stay.<br> I was relegated to the "corps".<br> Another dancing gypsy.<br> Benjamin, how is it<br> when you showed up,<br> you were no bigger than a bollard<br> with one foot in the grave.<br> Now... either I drink a helluva<br> lot more than I think I do,<br> or you sprouted!<br> What's your secret?<br> Well, Captain...<br> you do drink a lot.<br> We stayed in a small hotel with the<br> grand name, "The Winter Palace."<br> You have no idea what<br> you're talking about.<br> The hummingbird is<br> not just another bird.<br> Its heart rate is<br> Its wings beat<br> If you was to stop<br> their wings from beatin,<br> they would be dead in<br> less that ten seconds.<br> This is no ordinary bird,<br> this is a frikkin' miracle!<br> They slowed down their wings<br> with moving pictures,<br> and you know what they saw?<br> Their wingtips are doing...<br> You know what the figure "8"<br> is the mathematical symbol for?<br> Infinity!<br> Everybody, no matter<br> what differences they had,<br> languages, the color of their skin,<br> had one thing in common:<br> They were drunk<br> every single night.<br> Could you hold the lift, please?<br> -Thank you very much.<br> Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.<br> She was not beautiful.<br> She was plain as paper.<br> But she was pretty<br> as any picture to me.<br> What are you looking at?<br> If you must know, we have<br> a long standing agreement<br> never to go to bed sober.<br> Isn't that right, honey?<br> -Whatever you say, darling.<br> -Her husband was Walter Abbott.<br> He was Chief Minister of the<br> British Trade Mission in Murmansk.<br> And he was a spy.<br> Are you okay, darling?<br> -Oh yes.<br> I broke my heel off<br> one of my shoes.<br> I'm not in a habit of walking<br> about in my stocking feet.<br> They were long days there.<br> And even longer nights.<br> One particular night, I was<br> having trouble sleeping.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I couldn't sleep.<br> I was gonna make some tea.<br> Would you like some?<br> No, thank you.<br> -Milk? Honey?<br> -A bit of honey, please.<br> I hope you like flies in your<br> honey. -Oh, perhaps not.<br> Maybe... better to<br> let it steep a little.<br> Steep? -Soak.<br> I don't know, I mean... there's<br> a proper way of making tea.<br> Where I'm from,<br> people just want it to be hot.<br> Well, quite right.<br> You're a seaman?<br> -Sailor.<br> I hope I'm not being impolite,<br> but I have to ask:<br> Aren't you a little old<br> to be working on a boat?<br> There's no age limit,<br> as long as you can do the work.<br> And you have trouble<br> sleeping? Thank you.<br> I didn't think I did.<br> I usually sleep like a baby.<br> Something kept me up.<br> My father, in his eighties,<br> he was so convinced<br> he's gonna die in his sleep,<br> he limited himself to<br> having afternoon naps.<br> He was so determined<br> he was gonna cheat death.<br> Did he? -Did he what?<br> -Die in his sleep?<br> He died sitting in<br> his favorite chair,<br> listening to his favorite<br> program on the wireless.<br> He must have known something.<br> My husband is<br> British Trade Minister,<br> and we've been here<br> for fourteen months.<br> -Good God! -We were<br> supposed to go to Peking.<br> But it never seemed to work out.<br> Have you been in the Far East?<br> No. I've never been anywhere,<br> really. I mean outside harbors.<br> And where is it that you're from?<br> -New Orleans, Louisiana.<br> I didn't know<br> there was another.<br> And she told me about<br> all the places she had been.<br> What she had seen.<br> And we talked till<br> just before the dawn.<br> And we went back to our rooms,<br> to our separate lives.<br> But every night, we'd<br> meet again in that lobby.<br> A hotel in the middle of the<br> night can be a magical place.<br> A mouse running and stopping.<br> A radiator hissing.<br> A curtain blowing.<br> There's something peaceful,<br> even comforting,<br> knowing that people you love<br> are asleep in their beds,<br> where nothing can harm them.<br> Elizabeth and I would<br> lose track of the night,<br> till just before daybreak.<br> I think I may have given you<br> the wrong impression.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> Well, married women don't<br> customarily sit around<br> in the middle of the night<br> with strange men in hotels.<br> I wouldn't know what a married<br> woman does and doesn't do.<br> Good night!<br> Murmansk.<br> "I've met somebody and<br> I've fallen in love." Mom?<br> That was over 60 years ago.<br> -Did you love him, mother?<br> -What does a girl know about love?<br> I'm not dressed. -You look<br> splendid just as you are.<br> Don't waste any time bothering<br> about the wine or the cheese<br> in Murmansk, cause they are<br> really completely ordinary.<br> But the caviar and the vodka<br> are sublime and plentiful.<br> So...<br> Savor it... and don't<br> eat it all at once.<br> Because that way, there's<br> nothing left to enjoy.<br> Now take a little swallow of vodka<br> while it's still in your mouth.<br> Nazdrovia.<br> You haven't been with<br> many women, have you?<br> Not on sundays.<br> And you've never had a girlfriend<br> before, have you? -No ma'am.<br> When I was nineteen,<br> I attempted to become<br> the first woman ever to<br> swim the English Channel.<br> Really?<br> But the current that day<br> was so strong that...<br> for every stroke I took,<br> I was pushed back two.<br> I was in the water<br> for 32 hours.<br> And when I was<br> two miles from Calais,<br> it started to rain.<br> When I couldn't go any further,<br> I stopped.<br> I just stopped.<br> And everybody asked me<br> would I try again.<br> Why wouldn't I?<br> I never did.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I've never done anything<br> with my life after that.<br> Your hands are so coarse.<br> I can feel the wind<br> in your cheeks.<br> I'm afraid it's<br> the witching hour.<br> It was the first time<br> a woman had ever kissed me.<br> It's something<br> you never forget.<br> -Benjamin!<br> -You make me feel younger.<br> You make me feel years<br> younger too. I wish I was.<br> So many things I'd change.<br> I'd undo all my mistakes.<br> What mistakes?<br> I kept waiting, you know.<br> Thinking that I'd do something<br> to change my circumstances.<br> Do something.<br> Such an awful waste,<br> you never get it back.<br> Wasted time.<br> If we're going to have an affair,<br> you're never to look<br> at me during the day.<br> And we're always to<br> part before sunrise,<br> and we will never say<br> "I love you".<br> Those are the rules.<br> Are you cold?<br> -I'm freezing.<br> She was the first woman<br> that ever loved me.<br> Want me to skip some?<br> No, glad he had somebody<br> to keep him warm.<br> I couldn't wait<br> to see her again.<br> We saw each other every night.<br> We always used the same room.<br> But each time seemed<br> new and different.<br> Come here.<br> Elizabeth...<br> Good night.<br> Until one night.<br> Yesterday, December 7th 1941,<br> the day which will live in infamy.<br> ...in the near future,<br> and possibly beyond.<br> There's been a change<br> of plan, lads.<br> As you may or may not know,<br> the Japs bombed<br> Pearl Harbor yesterday.<br> Frank D. Roosevelt asked<br> each of us to do our part.<br> The Chelsea's been commissioned<br> to serve in the United States Navy.<br> To repair, salvage<br> and to rescue.<br> Anybody doesn't wanna go to war,<br> now's the time to say so.<br> Once you set foot on that boat,<br> you're in the Navy, friend.<br> I've been meaning to<br> talk with you, Mike.<br> My wife's doing poorly.<br> I'd like to maybe<br> see her one more time.<br> You're free to make your way<br> home any way you can, Mr Mayes.<br> If he's leaving,<br> who's gonna cook?<br> Food poisoning is one of the<br> leading causes of death at sea.<br> Right after inadequate<br> safety equipment.<br> I can cook, captain.<br> Been doin' it all my life.<br> Yeah, I knew it. You're a little<br> too old for war, Benjamin.<br> Ah, what the hell.<br> I'll take any man<br> who wants to kick the shit<br> out of Japs and Huns.<br> That's it! Back to your gear.<br> We're going to war, gentlemen!<br> She had left a note.<br> She wrote "It was nice<br> to have met you."<br> And that was it.<br> It wasn't the war<br> any of us expected.<br> We just towed crippled ships.<br> Scraps of metal, really.<br> If there was a war,<br> we didn't see it.<br> There was a man assigned to us.<br> The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.<br> But most of all,<br> he loved America.<br> There is no other<br> country in the world!<br> When you spell A.M.E.R.I.C.A,<br> you're spelling freedom.<br> His name was Dennis Smith and<br> he was a full blooded Cherokee.<br> His family had been americans<br> for over 500 years.<br> These pacifists. They say<br> they won't fight on conscience.<br> Where would we be...<br> if everybody decided to act<br> according to their conscience?<br> Keep it down, would you chief!<br> Hey...<br> I've been watching you.<br> You seem trustworthy.<br> If something happens to me,<br> could you see that<br> this gets to my wife?<br> He had given me all of his pay.<br> Hadn't spent a dime of it.<br> I want my family to know<br> that I was thinking about them.<br> All hands on deck!<br> Get you asses up here,<br> you lazy bastards!<br> The war had finally found us.<br> Full stop!<br> Pleasant, get on that light.<br> A transport carrying 1300 men<br> had been split by a torpedo.<br> We were first to<br> arrive at the scene.<br> Stop the engine!<br> Full stop!<br> We were the only sound.<br> Fellows!<br> We surely can't count<br> to outrun them fuckers.<br> Battle stations!<br> What?<br> Is that the last one?<br> Captain!<br> They shot the hell<br> out of my paintin'!<br> Give me your hand.<br> You'll be alright,<br> captain Mike.<br> Nice spot in heaven's<br> waitin' for you. Nice spot.<br> You could be mad as a mad dog<br> at the way things went.<br> You could swear,<br> curse the fates...<br> but when it comes to the end...<br> you have to let go.<br> Captain.<br> I said my goodbyes to the<br> Cherokee, Dennis Smith.<br> John Grimm who was right,<br> he was gonna die there.<br> I sent Pleasant Curtis'<br> wife his money.<br> I said goodbye to<br> the twin, Vic Brody,<br> and to Mike Clark, captain<br> of the tugboat "Chelsea."<br> I said goodbye to all the other men,<br> who had dreams of their own.<br> All the men who wanted to be<br> insurance salesmen or doctors<br> or lawyers or Indian chiefs.<br> This don't get fixed.<br> Out here, death<br> didn't seem natural.<br> I had never seen a hummingbird<br> that far out to sea.<br> Before or since.<br> And in may of 1945,<br> when I was 26 years old...<br> I'm coming!<br> Queenie? -Yes.<br> Oh, sweet Jesus!<br> You're home!<br> Lord, you came back!<br> Let me look at you!<br> Who's that, mama? -Child,<br> it's your brother, Benjamin.<br> I didn't know he<br> was my brother.<br> There's a shit load of<br> things you don't know.<br> Finish sweeping, wash your hands<br> and help me with the table. C'mon!<br> Turn around. Oh, you look<br> like you've been born again!<br> Younger than the springtime.<br> I think that preacher laid the hands<br> on you gave you a second life.<br> I knew it the moment<br> I saw you, you were special.<br> I tell you what, my knees are<br> sore cause I've been on them<br> every night asking the Lord,<br> I say God, bring him home safely.<br> Remember what I told you?<br> You never know what's comin'<br> for you? -That's right. Sit down.<br> Did you learn anything<br> worth repeating?<br> -I sure saw some things.<br> -Oh, you've seen some pain.<br> Some joy too? -Sure, sure I did.<br> -Yeah, that's what I wanna hear.<br> Look at you...<br> -Where's Tizzy?<br> Oh, baby!<br> Mr Weathers died in his sleep<br> one night last april.<br> Mama, I'm so sorry. -Don't you<br> worry about that, baby.<br> Well, there's only one or<br> two of them left now.<br> They're all just about new.<br> I guess they're waitin' their<br> turn like everybody else.<br> I'm so glad you're<br> back home with me.<br> Now we're going to find you<br> a wife and a new job.<br> Come and help me<br> with this table.<br> Benjamin! You're wasting<br> your time, baby.<br> She's stone deaf.<br> You'll be staying in what was<br> Mrs DeSeroux's old room.<br> You're too big to be rooming<br> with anybody else.<br> It's a funny thing<br> about coming home.<br> Looks the same. Smells<br> the same. Feels the same.<br> Did I ever tell you I've been<br> struck by lightning 7 times?<br> Once when I was sitting in my<br> truck, minding my own business.<br> You realise<br> what's changed, is you.<br> And late one morning,<br> not long after I'd been back...<br> Excuse me, is Queenie here?<br> Daisy?<br> It's me, Benjamin.<br> -Benjamin?<br> Oh my God!<br> Of course it's you! Benjamin!<br> How are you?<br> It's been such a long time!<br> There's so much I wanna know!<br> When did you get back?<br> -I got back few weeks ago.<br> I spoke to Queenie, she said<br> you were in the war,<br> somewhere at sea, we were so<br> worried about you. -I'm okay.<br> Well, look at you.<br> You are so lovely.<br> You stopped writing.<br> When I had left she was a girl.<br> And a woman had taken her place.<br> She was the most beautiful<br> woman I've ever seen.<br> Beautiful.<br> The most beautiful.<br> You remember grandma Fuller?<br> -Sure I do. -She passed.<br> I heard that, I'm sorry.<br> I just can't believe<br> we're both here.<br> Must be fate... no, no,<br> what did he call it? Kismet.<br> Do you know about Edgar Cayce,<br> the psychic? -I don't believe I...<br> He says that everything<br> is predetermined, but...<br> I like to think<br> that it is fate.<br> I'm not sure how it works,<br> but I'm glad it happened.<br> Have you been to Manhattan?<br> It's right across the river from me.<br> I can see the Empire State<br> Building if I stand on my bed.<br> What about you, where've<br> you been? Tell me everything.<br> Last time you wrote, you said<br> you've been to Russia.<br> I always wanted to go to Russia.<br> Is it as cold as they say?<br> -Twice as cold.<br> -My goodness!<br> We always said you were different.<br> I think you really are.<br> You wrote that you met<br> somebody. Did it work out?<br> It ran its course.<br> Hey, do you remember this?<br> This is the picture of Old Man<br> Kangaroo at 5 in the afternoon.<br> Would you like to have dinner?<br> Did I tell you that I danced<br> for Ballenchine?<br> He's a famous choreographer.<br> He said that I had perfect line.<br> In a rehearsal once,<br> a dancer fell.<br> And he just put it<br> right into the production.<br> Can you imagine that<br> in a classical ballet?<br> A dancer intentionally falling?<br> There's a whole new word for<br> dance now, it's called abstract.<br> He's not the only one though,<br> there's Lincoln Kirstein,<br> and Lucia Chase<br> and Agnes DeMille...<br> she has just torn up<br> all those conventions,<br> all that straight up<br> and down stuff...<br> And she told me about<br> this big new world.<br> Names that didn't<br> mean a thing to me.<br> I didn't really hear very much<br> of what she was saying.<br> It's new and modern<br> and it's American.<br> They understand our vigor<br> and our physicality.<br> Oh my God, I've just been<br> talking and talking.<br> No, no, I've enjoyed listening.<br> I didn't know you smoked.<br> -I'm old enough.<br> I'm old enough<br> for a lot of things.<br> In New York we stay up all night.<br> Watch the sun come up<br> over the warehouses.<br> There's always something to do.<br> I have to go back tomorrow.<br> -So soon?<br> -Wish I could stay.<br> Dancers don't need costumes<br> or scenery anymore.<br> I can imagine dancing<br> completely naked.<br> Have you read D.H. Lawrence?<br> His books were banned.<br> The words are like making love.<br> In our company,<br> we have to trust each other.<br> Sex is a part of it.<br> I know a lot of the dancers<br> are lesbians.<br> There was one woman who<br> wanted to sleep with me.<br> Was that upseting you?<br> -Which part?<br> Somebody wanted to sleep with me?<br> -You're a desirable woman,<br> I would think most of them<br> would wanna sleep with you.<br> Let's go back to the house.<br> Or we can get a room somewhere.<br> We can lay down your jacket.<br> -I don't know, Daisy...<br> It's not that I wouldn't like to.<br> I think I'd just disappoint you.<br> Benjamin, I've been<br> with older men.<br> You go back to New York<br> in the morning,<br> you should be with your friends.<br> You're only young once.<br> -Oh, I'm old enough.<br> Daisy, just not tonight, is all.<br> We can go hear some music.<br> Our lives are defined<br> by opportunities.<br> Even the ones we miss.<br> You look so handsome,<br> so distinct.<br> They're sayin' the hurricane is<br> gonna miss us. Blow right on by.<br> -Oh, that's great.<br> -I'll stay under the blankets...<br> with mother.<br> She said nothing...<br> Benjamin?<br> Things were becoming<br> different for me.<br> My hair had very little gray<br> and grew like weeds.<br> My sense of smell was keener,<br> my hearing more acute.<br> I could walk further and faster.<br> While everybody else was aging,<br> I was getting younger. All alone.<br> Come in.<br> Benjamin!<br> Do you remember me?<br> -Sure I do, Mr Button.<br> What happened to you?<br> -Darn foot got infected.<br> Welcome home, my friend.<br> I see you're still drinking<br> your Sazerac with whiskey.<br> I'm a creature of habit.<br> Still visiting the house<br> on Bourbon Street?<br> Not for a long time.<br> Interesting times, though.<br> We went from making 40 thousand<br> to nearly a million buttons a day.<br> We employed ten times<br> the number of people.<br> We were operating<br> around the clock.<br> Damn shame.<br> The war has been kind<br> to the button industry.<br> You know...<br> I'm sick. I don't know<br> how much longer I have.<br> I'm sorry to hear that,<br> Mr Button. -No...<br> I don't have any people.<br> I keep to myself.<br> I hope you don't mind, but...<br> whenever possible,<br> I'd enjoy your company.<br> I'll certainly do what I can.<br> Benjamin, do you know<br> anything about buttons?<br> Button's Buttons has been<br> in our family for 124 years.<br> My grandfather was a tailor.<br> He had a small shop in Richmond.<br> After the Civil War,<br> He moved to New Orleans<br> where my father had the wisdom<br> to make our own buttons.<br> So, with his help,<br> the tailor shop grew to this.<br> And today, I can't sew a stitch.<br> That's very, very interesting.<br> You sure have done<br> well for yourself.<br> So... what can I do<br> for you, Mr Button?<br> Benjamin, you are my son.<br> I'm so sorry I've never<br> told you before.<br> You were born the night<br> the Great war ended.<br> Your mother died<br> giving birth to you.<br> I thought you were a monster.<br> I promised your mother<br> I'd make sure you were safe.<br> I should never have<br> abandoned you.<br> My mother?<br> This is our summer house<br> on Lake Pontchartrain.<br> When I was a boy I loved to<br> wake up before anyone else,<br> run down to the lake<br> and watch the day begin.<br> It was as if I was<br> the only one alive.<br> I fell in love the<br> first time I saw her.<br> Your mother's name was<br> Caroline Murphy.<br> She worked in your<br> grandfather's kitchen.<br> She was from Dublin.<br> In 1903, Caroline and all<br> her brothers and sisters<br> came to live here,<br> in New Orleans.<br> I'd find excuses to go<br> down to that kitchen,<br> just so I could look at her.<br> April 25th 1918, the<br> happiest day of my life.<br> The day I married your mother.<br> Why didn't you just tell me?<br> I plan on leaving<br> everything I have to you.<br> I have to go.<br> -Where?<br> -Home.<br> What is he thinking?<br> He think he can just show up<br> and everything's supposed<br> to be fine and dandy.<br> Everybody's supposed<br> to be friends.<br> He got another thing coming,<br> that's for sure.<br> God be my witness,<br> he got another thing coming!<br> He left us 18 dollars<br> that night you was found.<br> and a filthy diaper!<br> -Good night, Mom.<br> -Good night, baby.<br> Did I ever tell you, I was<br> struck by lightning 7 times?<br> Once I was walking<br> the dog down the road.<br> I'm blind in the one eye,<br> can't hardly hear.<br> I get twitches and shakes<br> out of nowhere,<br> I always lose my line of thought.<br> But you know what?<br> God keeps reminding me<br> I'm lucky to be alive.<br> Storm's comin'.<br> Wake up.<br> Let's get you dressed.<br> You could be mad as a mad dog<br> at the way things went.<br> You can swear and<br> curse the fates...<br> but when it comes to the end...<br> you have to let go.<br> That sure is a beautiful service.<br> He'll be burried right<br> next to your mother.<br> You're my mother.<br> My baby.<br> I've never seen New York.<br> Excuse me, I'm a friend of<br> Daisy's. -Right this way.<br> Daisy!<br> Yes! I'm in the wardrobe!<br> Is somebody looking for me?<br> Benjamin! -Hi.<br> -What are you doing here?<br> -I thought I'd come visit.<br> Spend some time<br> with you if I could.<br> I wish you would have called.<br> You took me by surprise.<br> -Are you still mad?<br> -No. Thank you, they're lovely.<br> I couldn't take<br> my eyes off of you.<br> I thought you were mesmerizing.<br> Thank you. That's very<br> kind of you to say.<br> I better get changed. A group<br> of us are going to a party.<br> Would you wanna come?<br> Somebody told me about a restaurant<br> I thought you might enjoy.<br> I made a reservation.<br> Just in case.<br> It's just that all the dancers<br> go out after the show.<br> You're welcome to come with us.<br> I'll get changed, alright?<br> This is David.<br> He dances with the company.<br> This is Benjamin.<br> I told you about him.<br> Oh yeah... how are you doing?<br> I'll go get you a drink.<br> So, you were a friend<br> of her grandmother's?<br> Or something like that?<br> -Something like that.<br> -Excuse me.<br> Hey!<br> I had no idea you were coming!<br> Lord, Benjamin...<br> What did you expect?<br> What, you want me to drop<br> everything? This is my life.<br> Hey, going downtown?<br> Come on.<br> Have a good time. There'll be<br> musicians, interesting people...<br> You don't have to do that.<br> It's my fault.<br> I should've called.<br> I thought...<br> I'll come here and sweep you<br> off your feet, or something.<br> -Daisy, come on!<br> -I'll be right there.<br> He seems nice.<br> Do you love him?<br> I think so.<br> I'm happy for you.<br> Maybe I'll see you at home.<br> Okay.<br> I enjoyed the show!<br> He came to tell me<br> his father had died.<br> You couldn't have known.<br> I was 23. I just didn't care.<br> What did you do next?<br> -Some photographs, I think.<br> Front of my bag.<br> I was as good a dancer<br> as I was ever gonna be.<br> For five years...<br> I danced everywhere.<br> London, Vienna, Prague...<br> I've never seen these.<br> Mom, you never talked<br> about your dancing.<br> I was the only American<br> to be invited<br> to dance with the Bolshoi.<br> It was glorious.<br> But Benjamin was never<br> far from my thoughts.<br> And I'd find myself saying:<br> Goodnight, Benjamin.<br> -"Goodnight, Daisy."<br> -He said that?<br> Life wasn't all that complicated.<br> If you want, you might say<br> I was looking for something.<br> Benjamin, mrs La Tourneau<br> just passed.<br> Mr Benjamin Button?<br> -That would be me.<br> Bonjour.<br> -Oui, monsieur?<br> Miss Daisy Fuller.<br> -Just a minute.<br> Please, have a seat.<br> -Sure.<br> Sometimes we are on a collision<br> course and we just don't know it.<br> Whether it's by accident<br> or by design,<br> there's not a thing<br> we can do about it.<br> A woman in Paris was on<br> her way to go shopping.<br> But she had forgotten her coat,<br> and went back to get it.<br> When she had gotten her<br> coat the phone had rung,<br> so she had stopped to answer it<br> and talked for a couple of minutes.<br> While the woman was<br> on the phone,<br> Daisy was rehearsing for performance<br> at the Paris Opera House.<br> And while she was rehearsing,<br> the woman, off the phone now,<br> had gone outside to get a taxi.<br> Now a taxi driver had<br> dropped off a fare earlier,<br> and had stopped to<br> get a cup of coffee.<br> And all the while<br> Daisy was rehearsing.<br> And this cab driver who had<br> dropped off the earlier fare,<br> and had stopped to<br> get the cup of coffee,<br> had picked up the lady<br> who was going shopping,<br> who had missed<br> getting the earlier cab.<br> Taxi had to stop for a man<br> crossing the street,<br> who had left for work 5 minutes<br> later than he normally did,<br> because he forgot<br> to set his alarm.<br> While the man, late for work,<br> was crossing the street,<br> Daisy had finished rehearsing<br> and was taking a shower.<br> While Daisy was showering, taxi<br> was waiting outside a Boutique<br> for the woman to pick up a package<br> which hadn't been wrapped yet<br> because the girl who<br> was supposed to wrap it<br> had broken up with her boyfriend<br> the night before, and forgot.<br> When the package was wrapped,<br> the woman, who was back in the cab,<br> was blocked by a delivery truck.<br> All the while Daisy<br> was getting dressed.<br> The delivery truck pulled away<br> and the taxi was able to move.<br> While Daisy,<br> the last to be dressed,<br> waited for one of her friends<br> who had broken a shoelace.<br> While the taxi was stopped,<br> waiting for a traffic light,<br> Daisy and her friend came out<br> the back of the theater.<br> And if only one thing<br> had happened differently,<br> if that shoelace hadn't broken,<br> or that delivery truck had<br> moved moments earlier,<br> or that package had been<br> wrapped and ready,<br> because the girl hadn't<br> broken up with her boyfriend,<br> or that man had set his alarm<br> and got up five minutes earlier,<br> or that taxi driver hadn't<br> stopped for a cup of coffee,<br> or that woman had<br> remembered her coat<br> and had gotten<br> into an earlier cab,<br> Daisy and her friend would<br> have crossed the street.<br> And the taxi would<br> have driven by.<br> But life being what it is,<br> a series of intersecting<br> lives and incidents,<br> out of anyone's control,<br> that taxi did not go by,<br> and that driver was<br> momentarily distracted.<br> And that taxi hit Daisy.<br> -Daisy! Help!<br> And her leg was crushed.<br> Daisy...<br> -Who told you?<br> -Your friend wired me.<br> Very kind of you to come all this<br> way to see that I was alright.<br> You'd do the same for me.<br> My God!<br> Look at you.<br> You're perfect.<br> I wish you hadn't come.<br> I don't want you<br> to see me like this.<br> Her leg had been<br> broken in five places.<br> And with therapy, and time,<br> she might walk again.<br> But she'll never dance.<br> I'm gonna take you home with<br> me. I wanna look after you.<br> I'm not going back<br> to New Orleans.<br> Then I'll stay here in Paris.<br> Don't you understand?<br> I don't want your help.<br> I know I'm feeling<br> sorry for myself,<br> but I don't want to be with you.<br> I tried to tell you that in<br> New York, but you don't listen.<br> You might change your mind.<br> We are not little children<br> anymore, Benjamin.<br> Stay out of my life.<br> I was awfully cruel.<br> He didn't understand that...<br> I couldn't have him<br> see me like that.<br> I didn't leave right away.<br> I stayed in Paris for awhile<br> to look out for her.<br> I never knew that.<br> Darling, could you<br> get the nurse?<br> I taught myself to walk again.<br> I took the train to Lourdes.<br> Lets take a look.<br> That's normal.<br> Pulse rate is slowing. She is<br> gonna struggle to breathe.<br> Will you be alright?<br> -Yeah.<br> Alright, he says:<br> "I went back home..."<br> And then there's<br> lot of pages torn out.<br> "I listened to the sound of the<br> house." I think I've read that.<br> He spilled something on it,<br> so it's hard to read, mom.<br> Something about "sailing".<br> Does that make sense?<br> I learned to sail on an old boat of<br> my father's from the Lake House.<br> I can't lie, I did enjoy the<br> company of a woman or two.<br> Or maybe three.<br> Don't bother, Sam. It's just<br> gonna be there again tomorrow.<br> Mama.<br> And in the spring of 1962,<br> she came back.<br> You wanna know<br> where I've been? -No.<br> How come you didn't<br> write or nothin'?<br> Just disappearing like that.<br> It was something I needed<br> to do for myself.<br> I never took you to<br> be the selfish type.<br> I sure hope I'm not wrong.<br> I'm usually not wrong<br> about people.<br> -Good night, Momma.<br> -Good night, baby.<br> Now have fun.<br> You haven't said two words.<br> -I don't wanna ruin it.<br> Sleep with me. -Absolutely.<br> I asked her to come<br> away with me.<br> We sailed into the Gulf,<br> along the Florida Keys.<br> I'm so glad we didn't find<br> one another when I was 26.<br> -Why do you say that?<br> -I was so young.<br> And you were so old.<br> It happened when it was<br> supposed to happen.<br> I will enjoy each and every<br> moment I have with you.<br> I bet I can stay out here longer<br> than you. -Bet you can't.<br> You barely have<br> a line, a crease.<br> Every day I have<br> more wrinkles. Not fair.<br> I love your wrinkles.<br> Both of them.<br> What's it like,<br> growing younger?<br> Can't really say. I'm always<br> looking out of my own eyes.<br> Will you still love me when<br> my skin grows old and saggy?<br> Will you still love me<br> when I have acne?<br> When I wet the bed?<br> When I'm afraid of<br> what's under the stairs?<br> What?<br> What are you thinking?<br> -I was thinking how nothing lasts.<br> And what a shame that is.<br> Some things last.<br> -Goodnight, Daisy.<br> -Goodnight, Benjamin.<br> Mom?<br> When did you meet dad?<br> -Some time after that.<br> Did you tell him<br> about this Benjamin?<br> He knew enough, darling.<br> Momma!<br> Queenie!<br> Hallo?<br> Hi, Mrs Carter. It's Benjamin.<br> Where is everybody?<br> Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> So sorry for your loss.<br> She was a great woman.<br> We buried her beside<br> her beloved Mr Weathers.<br> And so we might have<br> memories of our own,<br> we sold my father's<br> house on Esplanade.<br> It's a wonderful<br> old place, darlin'.<br> I think we're going<br> to be so happy here.<br> Oh, what a long family<br> history you have.<br> They come with the house.<br> We have to see the master suite.<br> We bought ourselves a duplex.<br> I loved that house.<br> It smelled like firewood.<br> Don't stop, darlin'.<br> It was one of the happiest<br> times of my life.<br> We didn't have<br> a stick of furniture.<br> We would have picnics<br> in the living room.<br> We ate when we felt like it.<br> Stayed up all night<br> when we wanted.<br> We vowed never<br> to fall into routine,<br> to go to bed or wake up<br> at the same time.<br> We lived on that mattress.<br> Our neighbor, Mrs Van Dam,<br> was a physical therapist.<br> We lived four blocks<br> from a public pool.<br> You might have got a few<br> more years out of it.<br> You chose to do something<br> so special, unique,<br> that there was only a short<br> window of time you could do it.<br> So even if nothing ever happened,<br> you'd still be right here<br> where you're now.<br> I just don't like getting old.<br> They put too much<br> chlorine in here.<br> I promise you, I'll never lose<br> myself to self-pity again.<br> And I think right there<br> and then, she realised...<br> None of us is perfect forever.<br> She found her own peace.<br> She opened a studio and taught<br> young girls how to dance.<br> Come back the other way.<br> Excellent!<br> Good night!<br> You certainly are<br> beautiful to watch.<br> Dance is all about the line.<br> Line of your body.<br> Sooner or later you lose that line,<br> and you never get it back.<br> I figure...<br> You were born in 1918,<br> I am 43.<br> We are almost the same age.<br> We're meeting in the middle.<br> We finally caught up<br> with each other.<br> Wait. I want to remember<br> us just as we are now.<br> I am pregnant.<br> You know, I swear the nurse<br> slipped and said it was a boy.<br> But I think it's a girl.<br> I know you're afraid.<br> I'm not hiding it. -Okay.<br> -What's your worst fear?<br> -Baby born like me.<br> Then I will love it<br> all the more.<br> Okay.<br> How can I be a father when<br> I'm heading the other direction?<br> It's not fair to a child. I don't<br> wanna be anybody's burden.<br> Sugar, we all end up in diapers.<br> I'm gonna make this work.<br> I want this,<br> and I want it with you.<br> I want you to have<br> everything you want, all of it.<br> I'm just not sure<br> how to reconcile this...<br> Would you tell a blind man<br> he couldn't have children?<br> You be a father<br> for as long as you can.<br> I know the consequences.<br> I've accepted that.<br> Loving you was worth<br> everything to me.<br> I have to go pee.<br> The oldest woman to ever<br> swim the English Channel<br> arrived here today, in Calais,<br> Keep it!<br> having made the swim in 34 hours,<br> 68 years old Elizabeth Abbott,<br> arrived at 5:38 GMT,<br> exhausted but happy.<br> Mrs Abbott, how would you sum<br> up in words this achievement?<br> I suppose...<br> anything is possible.<br> Are you ready?<br> Yeah.<br> In the spring,<br> on a day like any other...<br> I'll be back in an hour!<br> Honey!<br> Gotta call the ambulance!<br> The baby is coming.<br> Operator, I need an ambulance!<br> Everyone's fine. She's a<br> perfectly healthy baby girl.<br> Honey...<br> She gave birth to a five pound<br> four ounce baby girl.<br> Did you count the toes?<br> She's perfect.<br> "And we named her for<br> my mother, Caroline."<br> This Benjamin was my father?<br> And this is how you tell me?<br> Excuse me.<br> ...all the conditions are there<br> for the major storm,<br> possibly even up<br> to a cathegory 5.<br> Hey, I know it's hard.<br> You can't smoke in here.<br> Nobody can tell you exactly<br> where it's gonna hit...<br> You grew as the doctor had<br> promised, normal and healthy.<br> You're gonna have to find<br> a real father for her.<br> What are you talking about?<br> She's gonna need someone<br> to grow old with.<br> She'll learn to accept whatever<br> happens.

The<br> house was filled with children.<br> -How are you?<br> -Hey, man.<br> Before you turn around,<br> they'll be in high school, dating.<br> I sold the summer house<br> on Lake Pontchartrain.<br> I sold Button's Buttons.<br> I sold my father's sailboat.<br> I put it all into<br> a savings account.<br> And so that you and your<br> mother might have a life,<br> I left, before you could<br> ever remember me.<br> "I left with just the clothes<br> on my back."<br> I don't want to read this now.<br> Can you just tell me<br> where he went?<br> I don't really know.<br> It's for me. 1970.

Yes, speaking.<br> I'm sorry, I don't understand.<br> It's the corner house.<br> Come on in!<br> I'm Daisy Fuller.<br> -I'm David Hernandez<br> with the Orleans Parish dept<br> of Child Welfare Services.<br> He was living in the<br> condemned building.<br> The police found this<br> with him, this address,<br> it's got your name<br> in here a lot.<br> He's in a very poor health.<br> He was taken to the hospital.<br> He doesn't seem to know who or<br> where he is. He's very confused.<br> I was telling Mr Hernandez<br> that Benjamin is one of us.<br> If he needs a place to stay,<br> it's alright. He can stay here.<br> Benjamin.<br> You play beautifully.<br> He doesn't seem to<br> like to be touched.<br> He goes in and out of<br> states of recognition.<br> The doctors said if they<br> didn't know any better...<br> it is the beginnings<br> of dementia.<br> Do you remember me?<br> I'm Daisy.<br> I'm Benjamin.<br> It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.<br> Do you mind if I sit with you?<br> I would love to hear you play.<br> Do I know you?<br> And every day I would stop by<br> to make sure he was comfortable.<br> Don't think that I don't<br> know what you're doing!<br> You're all fucking liars!<br> He doesn't believe<br> he just had his breakfast.<br> Why don't we see if we can find<br> something else for you to do.<br> I have a feeling there's a lot<br> of things I can't remember.<br> Like what, sugar?<br> It's like...<br> there's this whole life I had,<br> and I can't remember what it was.<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay to forget things.<br> Many times he would simply<br> forget who or where he was.<br> It wasn't easy.<br> -Benjamin!<br> I can see everything!<br> I can see the big river!<br> That's right. You can see<br> everything, sweetheart.<br> I can see the graveyard where<br> mama's buried and other people.<br> I want you to come down!<br> -What if I can fly?<br> I knew a man who could fly.<br> Come down and I'll<br> tell you all about him.<br> Somebody go up there.<br> He was five when I moved in.<br> Nearly the same age I was<br> when I had met him.<br> This is the picture of Old Man<br> Kangaroo at 5 in the afternoon,<br> when he got his<br> beautiful hind legs.<br> The days passed, and I watched<br> as he forgot how to walk...<br> What's my name?<br> ...how to talk.<br> I'm Daisy.<br> Can you say Daisy?<br> In 2002, they put up a new<br> clock in that train station.<br> And in the spring of 2003,<br> he looked at me,<br> and I knew that<br> he knew who I was.<br> And then he closed his eyes<br> as if he would go to sleep.<br> I wish I had known him.<br> Now you do.<br> Mom, I think I should go<br> see what's going on.<br> Goodnight, Benjamin.<br> Some people are born<br> to sit by a river.<br> Some get struck by lightning.<br> Some have an ear for music.<br> Some are artists.<br> Some swim.<br> Some know buttons.<br> Some know Shakespeare.<br> Some are mothers.<br> And some people... dance.<br>
