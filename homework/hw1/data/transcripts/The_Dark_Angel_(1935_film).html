Curse them!<br> It's the other things<br> We want to see,<br> And your fine words<br> Don't make it easier.<br> It's the green grass<br> And the flowing brooks<br> And the hills<br> In all their colors<br> And the faces<br> Of those people we love-<br> Those are the things<br> We want to see,<br> And those are the things<br> We'll never see again!<br> What do we care<br> How grateful you are?<br> I want to see my girl again.<br> That's all I want to see.<br> That's all I want to see!<br> Shut up!<br> Shut up, I tell you!<br> We know what you feel.<br> We feel it too.<br> What good does this do?<br> Shut up and sit down.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It can't be helped sometimes.<br> Gentlemen, I think<br> We're all tired.<br> I'll extend your regrets<br> To our guest, Mr. Tanner,<br> And I'm sure he'll understand.<br> Now, suppose we all<br> Go to bed,<br> And I hope<br> You all rest well.<br> Are the lights out yet?<br> How the devil<br> Do I know?<br> What difference<br> Does it make, anyway?<br> No, they're not out yet.<br> Can't you tell<br> When they go out?<br> No, I can't. I guess<br> I'm not used to it yet.<br> There go the lights now.<br> Can't you<br> Tell the difference?<br> No.<br> Good night,<br> George.<br> Good night, archie.<br> I say.<br> Yes?<br> Thanks for stopping me<br> Down there.<br> Oh, that's all right.<br> Good night, Crane.<br> Good night, austin.<br> Y.<br> Darling, good night.<br> I hope you're not<br> Too glad to leave us.<br> No, I think<br> I'm rather sorry.<br> You want to join them<br> Out there, Crane?<br> Oh, no, thank you.<br> I must be off soon.<br> We haven't been able to help<br> You very much, I'm afraid.<br> That's true, sir. It's<br> Been my fault, not yours.<br> Fighting something<br> With yourself, aren't you?<br> Yes, I suppose<br> You could call it that.<br> You don't want to<br> Talk about it?<br> No, sir George.<br> All right, Crane.<br> Now, there are a few routine<br> Things I must tell you.<br> First of all, I'm<br> Assigning an orderly to you.<br> He's a very pleasant fellow.<br> Worked for us before.<br> He will stay with you<br> Until you're settled.<br> I'd rather not.<br> Those are the rules.<br> He'll take you<br> To your home...<br> But I'm not going home.<br> I have no... Home.<br> And your name<br> Is not roger Crane.<br> It's as good a name<br> As any other.<br> Yes, I suppose so.<br> In any event,<br> It's your own business.<br> I've some things here<br> That belong to you.<br> A few pounds,<br> A very<br> Disreputable-looking pipe...<br> Thank you.<br> ...and a picture.<br> Oh. May I...?<br> No. I've kept<br> These things for a reason.<br> Now, look here, Crane.<br> You came to us<br> From an enemy prison hospital.<br> Your card read that all means of<br> Identification had been destroyed,<br> But that you'd given<br> The name of roger Crane.<br> Now, I could have pursued<br> The matter of identification,<br> But I didn't.<br> I knew that.<br> I was grateful. May I-<br> I knew that you were trying<br> To put the past behind you,<br> But today-<br> Today the past has come back,<br> And must be faced.<br> The picture.<br> This picture's<br> Of three people,<br> And I see there's<br> An inscription on the back.<br> "take care of each other.<br> Kitty."<br> Those people are not<br> Strangers to one another.<br> Why aren't you going home?<br> Fear of being pitied,<br> I suppose.<br> Fear of being a nuisance.<br> That's been your fight?<br> Yes.<br> All right, Crane,<br> Then fight your fight through<br> And go home.<br> Now, look here. I want<br> You to do something for me.<br> I want you to prove to me<br> That I'm not a failure<br> By going back to your people<br> And your friends<br> And living among them<br> Like an ordinary man.<br> You need owe nothing<br> To anyone but yourself.<br> But you do need<br> Love and companionship.<br> You can't live without them,<br> You know.<br> Now, go home.<br> You think I should?<br> You think it's right?<br> Yes, Crane, yes...<br> I do.<br> I've wanted to,<br> Every day, every hour.<br> The sun's out, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> And before it goes down,<br> You can be home.<br> Before it goes down,<br> I can be home.<br> It's true.<br> Think of it.<br> Before it goes down,<br> I'll be-<br> I'll be home!<br> Now we're coming<br> Into medford.<br> I used to come here for<br> The fair when I was a boy.<br> Pretty country,<br> Isn't it?<br> What time do you make it?<br> Getting very near.<br> I make it 12:23.<br> You must be a little slow.<br> Another 22 minutes.<br> The last minutes<br> Are always the longest.<br> Yes. Do you mind if I step out in<br> The corridor and have a bite, sir?<br> No, you go. I suppose<br> I've about talked your head off.<br> Oh, that's all right, sir.<br> Care to see the paper?<br> Thanks very much.<br> Thank you.<br> Why, I'm sorry. I<br> - I didn't know.
