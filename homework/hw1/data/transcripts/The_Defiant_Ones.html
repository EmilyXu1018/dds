A fella'd give me<br> his car and I'd say "Thank you, sir."<br> I was doin' him a favour,<br> but I had to say "Thank you, sir."<br> - The louder I said it, the bigger the tip.<br> - That figures.<br> You gotta be Charlie Potatoes,<br> the man with the money.<br> Then you don't have to<br> bow down to nobody.<br> That's the way I'm gonna live.<br> Even when they didn't give me a tip<br> I still had to say thank you.<br> That word got like it was stickin'<br> needles in me every time I said it.<br> That can happen with a word.<br> You know what I mean, boy?<br> Yeah. And I got a needle stickin' in me<br> right now. Joker, don't call me "boy".<br> You're just too sensitive, man.<br> - I'm too nothin'.<br> - That's right.

I don't try to argue out of it.<br> You can call me a bohunk. I don't mind.<br> You ever hear tell of a bohunk<br> in a woodpile, Joker?<br> You ever hear tell of<br> "catch a bohunk by the toe"?<br> - Depends on how you mean it.<br> - How'd you mean it?<br> Don't crowd me!<br> I didn't make up no names!<br> No, you breathe it in when you're born,<br> and you spit it out from then on.<br> That name sure bugs you, don't it?<br> Well, that's the way it is, and you're stuck<br> with it, cos I didn't make any rules.<br> - No, but you sure live by 'em.<br> - Everybody lives by 'em.<br> - Even them swamp animals.<br> - Even that weasel.<br> You callin' me a weasel?<br> No, I'm callin' you a white man.<br> (hooting)<br> What's the matter?<br> Nothin'.<br> Come on, let's get outta here.<br> (distant voice) Gee up!

Thanks. Thanks.<br> Thanks. Thanks!<br> That word sure bugs you, don't it?<br> Well, I been sayin' it all my life.<br> When I was a kid, I didn't have no shoes.<br> In church I'd sit with the rest of the kids<br> and I'd say "Thank you, Lord! Thank you!"<br> Well, they didn't have<br> no shoes either, Joker.<br> All God's children got shoes.<br> Come on.<br> (dogs barking)<br> Muller speakin'. Kill the roadblocks.<br> They've headed north.<br> No, no chance of them circlin' back.<br> They're already across the McHenry.<br> The trail is still pretty fresh.<br> We should have 'em in a day or two.<br> Max, I've got somethin' I want<br> to say to you. It's important.<br> Get down.<br> Call my wife, will you?<br> Tell her everything's OK.<br> Listen, Max. This is important.<br> I'm not lettin' my dogs<br> cross that water out there.<br> Fine.<br> I'm lettin' nobody make me ruin my dogs.<br> I hope you treat your grandmother<br> the way you treat those dogs.<br> - Oh, that's funny.<br> - Wasn't meant to be.<br> Well, I think more of these here dogs<br> than I do of any two old stinkin' convicts.<br> Good. Good.<br> Max, you don't care if<br> I use your phone, do you?<br> ( rock'n'roll)<br> Got anythin'?<br> Well, the way I got it figured,<br> we'll ford it here...<br> (radio off)<br> Regroup across the river,<br> then backtrack and pick up the trail.<br> - Fine.<br> - That detour will cost us two hours.<br> - Can't be helped.<br> - I think it could.<br> Why don't we call Cumberland?<br> For what? Ask for a tank<br> and armoured divisions?<br> They have a 12-hour start,<br> and we're about to lose two!<br> - I appreciate the arithmetic.<br> - Catchin' men is my business.<br> And makin' the decisions is mine.<br> It don't look like much.<br> That the company store?<br> Yeah.<br> There's tools in there,<br> and food too, waitin' for us.<br> They'll be asleep pretty soon. We better<br> hunker down before somebody sees us.<br> (hogs snorting)<br> They sloppin' the hogs.<br> That means suppertime's over.<br> I used to feed the hogs<br> at the prison farm sometimes.<br> That sure was a nice farm.<br> Yeah. All that machinery.<br> You know somethin'? Fella get himself<br> a farm, he'd have a pretty sweet setup.<br> As long as a fella don't have to scratch it<br> out with hand tools and a mule.<br> Leastways you always got<br> somethin' to eat.<br> I worked 36 acres by hand once.<br> My wife...<br> My wife helped me.<br> Sometimes even my little kid.<br> Man, we never had enough to eat.<br> I didn't know you was married.<br> What happened to your kid?<br> He was just five years old when I left.<br> He don't even remember me that much.<br> Everybody winds up alone.<br> Not just you. Everybody.<br> That's the way it is.<br> One down, five to go.<br> I got an old man around someplace.<br> The last time I seen him<br> was the day I got out of the army,<br> and we spent half my bonus cheque<br> gettin' lushed up together.<br> Ahh, I got nothin' against him.<br> My old man,<br> he was a Bible-thumper.<br> - Always tryin' to teach us somethin'.<br> - What's there to know?<br> I used to work in automobiles.<br> Transmission man.<br> $1.80 an hour, so some fink in a Cadillac<br> could drive it without havin' to shift gears.<br> - That's pretty good pay.<br> - You know what it meant to me?<br> Saturday night in a gin mill,<br> bein' Charlie Potatoes with a blonde,<br> or maybe a redhead. Anythin' I wanted.<br> Then Monday mornin' there I was, back<br> in that pit with grease in my eyeballs.<br> - Somebody gotta fix them cars.<br> - Let somebody else fix them cars.<br> Me? I wanna drive 'em!<br> - You gotta buy 'em first.<br> - On a buck-eighty an hour?<br> That's just a stopover<br> for a second-hand Chevy.<br> Nah, not for me. I got smart.<br> You're a maker or a taker. Me, I'm a taker.<br> That's how you wound up in jail.<br> Because I didn't know how to be<br> a big enough taker. I was just a stealer.<br> You gotta be a big enough crook<br> so you can get away with anythin'.<br> Just a few more lights now.<br> What did they get you for?<br> Assault and battery. Intent to kill.<br> Oh, that's great.<br> Man come on my land<br> cos I didn't pay the note.<br> When I gave him an argument,<br> he pulled a gun on me.<br> - I took it away from him.<br> - They put you in jail for that?<br> I whipped his head good.<br> Were you gonna kill him?<br> Maybe.<br> - If they hadn't pulled me off him, I would.<br> - You gotta roll with them punches.<br> Yeah!<br> What are you gettin' so mad about?<br> I ain't gettin' mad, Joker.<br> I been mad all my natural life.<br> - I'm just tellin' you the facts of life.<br> - I don't wanna hear it.<br> I been listenin' to that stuff all my life.<br> From my wife: "Be nice."<br> They throwed me in solitary confinement,<br> and she said "Be nice."<br> A man'd shortweight me. She'd say<br> "Be nice, or you get in trouble."<br> She'd teach my kid that same damn thing.<br> I never could get that woman to<br> understand how I was feelin' inside.<br> All of a sudden there<br> was nothin' left to say.<br> Ain't they never goin' to sleep?<br> I used to think,<br> if I could get away someplace,<br> someplace where folks<br> weren't always so afraid,<br> maybe she won't be<br> so afraid all the time.<br> Well...<br> There you go.<br> Well, that buttons it up for the night.<br> If we leave now they'll be asleep<br> when we get down there. Come on.<br> What?<br> Your white face shines out<br> like a full moon.<br> - What am I gonna do about it?<br> - I don't know what you're...<br> Here.<br> - How's that?<br> - Missed a couple of spots.<br> - Now just the meanness shines through.<br> - Then we sure look alike.<br> Check. Come on.<br> (insects chirping)<br> (dog barks)<br> (crow squawks)<br> Chain.<br> Can't see much.<br> Go on.<br> I... I can't reach it.<br> (cans clattering)<br> (dogs bark)<br> - I'm slippin'.<br> - Grab a hold of the chain.<br> Urgh!<br> Grab a hold of the chain!<br> (loud crash)<br> - How you doin', Joker?<br> - My wrist... My wrist...<br> (dogs barking)<br> I bet we woke up this whole town.<br> - Somebody's in there! I heard 'em!<br> - Hey! Over here!<br> - Do you see anybody?<br> - There's somebody in there!<br> - Where's Claude? He's got the key.<br> - Forget it! Let's try the back door.<br> They're in there, I know it.<br> You hang on to me, Joker, the best way<br> you can. We're gettin' outta here.<br> Hey, come on back here!<br> Hold it, you guys!<br> Here they are!<br> Hold it!<br> - Looks like you two boys are in trouble.<br> - Mac, they hurt Joe real bad!<br> Say! This one's white!<br> Here, Max. You look pretty beat.<br> I figured sure we'd grab 'em<br> sometime today.<br> Take it easy.<br> Here comes Captain Bligh.<br> ( rock'n'roll)<br> - How about a nice hot coffee, Captain?<br> - No.<br> - I thought you'd want the casualty report.<br> - Go ahead.<br> Three men.<br> - How bad?<br> - Legs.<br> - Send 'em back.<br> - Someone's gotta go with 'em.<br> - Pick someone out.<br> - That's a lot of men outta the line.<br> - What about it?<br> - Solly says the trail'll get no fresher.<br> So?<br> So I'd like to make it a matter of record<br> that I requested help. You refused.<br> - It's your responsibility.<br> - It is my responsibility.<br> Anythin' else you'd like to remind me of?<br> Just this.<br> I happen to be civil service.<br> I don't have to worry about my job.<br> Got a point there, Max.<br> If I listened to him<br> I'd be callin' out the marines.<br> If they get away because you refused<br> to call in help, you'll look pretty foolish.<br> And I'd have to print it, Max.<br> Look, let me tell you somethin', Dave.<br> I got a wife and two kids. And a mortgage.<br> My job as sheriff pays me 6800 a year.<br> It comes in steady.<br> I don't have to work too hard.<br> It's a good setup and I like it.<br> But don't frighten me about losin' it.<br> I can always go back to practisin' law.<br> Max... no offence.<br> We've been friends a long time.<br> You never made much of a livin'<br> as a lawyer. Stop kiddin' yourself.<br> I didn't think it was possible, but<br> I'm beginnin' to hate those two men.<br> I'll get them.<br> Rafe, get rid of the women and children.<br> Come on, ladies. Let's go.<br> - What you men fixin' to do?<br> - Old-fashioned prayer meetin', ma'am.<br> Let's go now. Come on. Let's go.<br> Prayer meetin'. That's pretty funny.<br> Give us a break, buddy, uh?<br> I ain't your buddy. You got your buddy.<br> Which one of you did it?<br> Did you do it?<br> Why did you do it?<br> - How is he, Sam?<br> - He ain't come to yet.<br> - He oughta be all right.<br> - He oughta be.<br> Did he do it?<br> Are you protectin' your buddy?<br> It don't matter. You're both gonna hang.<br> You can't do anythin' to us.<br> We're escaped cons.<br> - So?<br> - So they're lookin' for us.<br> What you gonna do when they find us?<br> You gonna be crow meat<br> when they find you.<br> Well, you ain't gonna get away with it.<br> Nobody's gonna know<br> who pulled the rope.<br> Don't you know there's a reward<br> for escaped convicts?<br> Rewards always say "dead or alive".<br> Don't you understand?<br> You can't go lynchin' me.<br> I'm a white man!<br> You are?<br> I'll tell you the kind of white man you are.<br> - Spit on him.<br> - For God's sake...<br> - Go on! Spit on him.<br> - Mac...<br> Let me alone, Sam!<br> We're just havin' a little fun, huh, boys?<br> Come on, you heard me.<br> Wait!<br> Outta my way, Sam,<br> or you'll have trouble, too.<br> - I told you. Joe's gonna be all right.<br> - You told me. Fine!<br> You just don't give a damn, do ya?<br> All right. The rest of you big men,<br> you wanna lynch 'em, huh?<br> You, Glover.<br> You look anxious. Go ahead.<br> Tie it around their necks. Go on!<br> You want blood, huh?<br> Well, here. Go ahead! Chop 'em up!<br> Go on!<br> Or do you wanna burn 'em?<br> Do you wanna burn 'em, huh?<br> You wanna burn 'em?<br> Or do you wanna burn 'em?<br> Go on! Burn 'em!<br> Mac!<br> Go on! Burn their eyes out!<br> Now,<br> any more big men?<br> Joe's all right.<br> Took six stitches, but he's OK.<br> All right. Lock them two up.<br> I'll take 'em back in the mornin'<br> in the wagons.<br> Put Mac in the shack where he belongs.<br> The rest of you go to bed.<br> Long gone<br> Ain't he lucky<br> Long gone<br> To Kentucky<br> Long gone<br> What I mean<br> Long gone Sam on a bowlin' green<br> Bowlin' green<br> Sewin' machine<br> Little kitten sittin'<br> On a sewin' machine<br> Sewin' machine<br> Sew so fast<br> Sew eleven stitches<br> You musta been crazy<br> to do a thing like that.<br> They might've beat us to death.<br> They still might.<br> What you got to live for, Joker?<br> You wanna spend the next 20 years<br> on some chain gang, bustin' rock?<br> It's better than bein' dead.<br> You ever seen a lynchin'?<br> Why?<br> Cos anybody as scared as you was, man,<br> they... they got to have seen a lynchin'.<br> Yeah, I seen a lynchin'.<br> I seen what they do to a guy,<br> how they drag him outta jail in the middle<br> of the night, like that mob out there.<br> They start drinkin'.<br> Then they start thinkin'.<br> And Big Sam, he falls asleep somewhere.<br> Then that mob comes in here<br> and they get us. Then what?<br> That's mighty easy for you, Joker.<br> You just tell 'em you're a white man.<br> (lock being forced open)<br> Wait a minute. What are you doin'?<br> I didn't hear any wagon bein' hitched up.<br> I'm lettin' you loose.<br> What do you mean,<br> you're lettin' us loose?<br> I already told you.

He'll be back.<br> Uh...<br> I've been to the Mardi Gras.<br> Yeah? Is it really like what it says?<br> It's all right.<br> You mean it ain't like what it says?<br> No, it's fine. It's very nice.<br> A lot of music and a lot of dancin'.<br> Good-lookin' women.<br> Oh, I...<br> I must look awful. I...<br> I been doin' the washin'.<br> Are you gonna be stayin' long?<br> No?<br> They comin' after you?<br> There's a train.<br> Tomorrow. Hits the ridge about<br> one o'clock in the afternoon.<br> It's a good place to catch it, too.<br> It goes slow up the ridge.<br> How come... how come you know<br> so much about the train?<br> My husband used to work for the line.<br> I found 'em.<br> - You got enough room for a swing?<br> - You just hold that chain, Joker.<br> Now me.<br> Here, hold that.<br> We cut loose now.<br> What's the matter with him?<br> He's sick. He got poison in his system.<br> - Heat some water!<br> - Stay where you are, kid.<br> Do like I told you!<br> Well, you get in there with him.<br> All right, they hit you. Then what?<br> What did you do to them?<br> I don't know. The next thing I know,<br> the doctor is fixin' me up.<br> Do you know what happened last night?<br> No, huh?<br> You, lady?<br> You? Were you deaf and blind<br> last night, too?<br> They sent us women away.<br> Why?<br> Ask them.<br> Sam, what did you do with 'em?<br> Like I told you before, Sheriff.<br> We caught 'em, locked 'em up.<br> They broke out and ran away.<br> Those jimmy marks are<br> on the outside of the door.<br> They didn't break out. Somebody<br> broke in and got them. Who was it?<br> I wouldn't know about that, Sheriff.<br> I run a turpentine camp, not a jail.<br> Who came for them, Sam?<br> Who came and got them?<br> Sam, if you lynched 'em,<br> you'd better tell me now.<br> The dogs are gonna find 'em anyhow.<br> Why'd we wanna kill 'em? Appears to me<br> like you're better rigged for that than us.<br> All right, that's enough.<br> Solly, get goin'.<br> You've been rushin' my dogs since<br> early this mornin'! They're bushed!<br> I'm tired of your complaining<br> about your dogs!<br> Will you get goin'!<br> Wait, Max. How about us?<br> We're dead tired on our feet.<br> - Max, have a heart.<br> - It'll be dark soon.<br> You wanted to be deputies, didn't you?<br> Well, you're under orders,<br> so get ready to move out!<br> Come on, come on.<br> Call Cumberland. Tell them<br> I want every man they can spare.<br> These men better be field-equipped.<br> It'll be dark before they can get started.<br> I don't care when they start!<br> You get them movin'!<br> All right, Sheriff.<br> All right.<br> You know that's the first time<br> I seen him smile?<br> Yeah.<br> - Where is he?<br> - Shh!<br> - How long I been asleep?<br> - Couple of hours.<br> - Where's the kid?<br> - In the other room.<br> - I'd better wake Cullen.<br> - No.<br> Don't go yet.<br> - You're feverish. You got plenty of time.<br> - What time is it?<br> About two o'clock.<br> - You been sittin' here all night?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Why don't you go and get some sleep?<br> I want to stay.<br> What is it?<br> I was thinkin' of the last time somebody<br> sat up all night takin' care of me.<br> Your wife?<br> No.<br> A skinny old man with a moustache.<br> He had red eyes and a torn T-shirt.<br> He was an orderly in the prison hospital.<br> I had a sunstroke from<br> workin' on the road gang.<br> I ain't married.<br> What's it like?<br> - What's what like?<br> - You know. Prison.<br> How you gonna explain it?<br> Is it lonesome?<br> Yeah.<br> What happened to your old man?<br> He run off... eight months ago.<br> I been stuck here.<br> Must get pretty lonesome for ya.<br> It's like that in jail, ain't it?<br> Yeah. It's like that.<br> - Does it ever get really bad?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> No. No, I mean...<br> I mean so bad that you just feel<br> kinda empty inside. You know?<br> Like a big empty thing, and all you<br> wanna do is fill it up with tears.<br> I'll tell you somethin'.<br> You fill it up with tears and you're a goner.<br> What can you do?<br> I fill it up with dreams.<br> You gotta know about somethin'<br> before you can dream about it.<br> No, you don't.<br> Look, I was born 20 miles from here.<br> And I just don't know nothin' else.<br> You don't have to know.<br> All you have to do is want.<br> Then you make up a million pictures<br> in your own head.<br> - Pictures?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> - What kind of pictures?<br> - All kinds of pictures.<br> Different things, different places,<br> different people.<br> All the things you ever wanted,<br> but you ain't gonna get.<br> Sometimes it's music and<br> bright lights and paper streamers,<br> and I'm dancin' in the streets.<br> Like the Mardi Gras?<br> Mm-hm. Just like the Mardi Gras.<br> And sometimes...<br> Sometimes I'm on a boat, a long boat,<br> and... I'm goin' far away.<br> I'm goin' to places<br> that I never seen before.<br> White sand.<br> Hot sun.<br> And tall buildings.<br> All tall buildings...<br> reachin' way up into the sky.<br> Tall buildings made of glass.<br> And there's always somebody waitin'.<br> Somebody clean,<br> and warm,<br> and nice.<br> Is she beautiful?<br> I better get Cullen.<br> Is she prettier than me?<br> It's been so long.<br> I get the dreams mixed up<br> with the real thing.<br> It's real now.<br> Don't go away.<br> I ain't goin' anywhere.<br> Don't go away.<br> (insects chirping)<br> (birds singing)<br> Hi.<br> - Mornin'! You're up early.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - I'll change your dressin'.<br> - It's OK.<br> That's great.<br> Thank you.<br> - I made you some breakfast.<br> - Fine.<br> - What's that? That your old man's?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> You're just about the same size.<br> You're a good-lookin' woman.<br> He must've been crazy to leave.<br> Oh, this place is no good. It needs a man.<br> - He'll be back one day.<br> - Yeah? Well, I won't be here.<br> - Where you figure on goin'?<br> - Where do you?<br> - I'm bound for Rio.<br> - Listen...<br> - I ain't got time.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - You like me, don't you?<br> - Yeah, I like you. I like you a lot.<br> Take me with you.<br> - Law's on my tail. I'm runnin' scared.<br> - I don't care. Take me with you.<br> - You gonna ride the freights with me?<br> - We don't have to. I got a car.<br> - A car?<br> - In the shed, in back.<br> Wait a minute! It's busted! It won't start!<br> - Get in and try it!<br> - Well, it won't start.<br> - How long's it been here?<br> - Three weeks.<br> All right, hit it.<br> - Try it again. Try it again!<br> - I am!<br> - It's the battery. You got a crank?<br> - I don't know. Do I?<br> - Put it in neutral.<br> - It's in neutral.<br> OK?<br> (engine starts)<br> - I gotta get Cullen.<br> - We can't take him!<br> - Why not?<br> - They'll recognise you!<br> - They're gonna spot us anyway.<br> - No, we'll travel as man and wife.<br> What about Cullen?<br> What's the difference if they're<br> followin' one or two of you?<br> What about Billy?<br> We can drop him off at my brother's,<br> then go south.<br> We're goin' too fast. I gotta think.<br> Honey, there ain't no time to think.<br> Will you come on?<br> All right. All right, get packed.<br> We'll leave in a couple...<br> (engine still running)<br> Nice shirt.<br> We're goin' south.<br> - We?<br> - Me and her.<br> - In this?<br> - Yeah, it runs.<br> Yeah? You're wastin' your gas.<br> (engine off)<br> They'll be watchin' the roads.<br> They'll be watchin' where<br> the dogs are goin'.<br> That kinda makes me the bait, don't it?<br> Cullen, travellin' together we're like<br> a sign that says "come and get us".<br> He's too weak to travel on foot anyway.<br> You got the same chance alone.<br> Maybe better.<br> I'll fix you somethin' to eat.<br> You got it all figured out.<br> Hey, you better go and get washed, Billy.<br> How far is it to that railroad?<br> About 12 miles,<br> if you go through the hills.<br> I'm fixin' sandwiches.<br> There's coffee there.<br> If I go through the hills?<br> Or you can short-cut through the swamp.<br> Swamp?<br> Save you a couple of hours.<br> Make it harder for the dogs.<br> You can find it easy.<br> Which way is that?<br> Go right up here by the shed.<br> You'll see a path.<br> Follow that till you get to the swamp.<br> You'll see a great big cypress over on<br> your left about half a mile. Follow that.<br> Then what?<br> Then nothin'. The rest is easy.<br> Just head for the railroad, that's all.<br> Thanks for the grub.<br> Hey, Cullen.<br> Yeah?<br> So long.<br> So long, Joker.<br> Here, I'll burn that.<br> Not now, honey, please...<br> We got plenty of time. Suppose...<br> We're goin' on a trip to Cumberland.<br> - Now?<br> - Now.<br> - Go and take your clothes off the line.<br> - Cumberland? With him?<br> Yeah.<br> You like him, don't you?<br> Sure. He's all right.<br> Well, go on.<br> You better talk to that kid.<br> On the way. He's a smart kid.<br> I wonder what they'll do<br> to Cullen if they catch him.<br> Don't worry, they won't.<br> - What makes you so sure?<br> - Look, will you quit worryin'?<br> They ain't gonna catch him, cos he ain't<br> never gonna get out of that swamp alive.<br> What?
