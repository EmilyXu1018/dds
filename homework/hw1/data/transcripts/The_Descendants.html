                        My friends on the mainland...<br> ...think just because I live in Hawai'i...<br> ...I live in paradise.<br> Like a permanent vacation.<br> We're all just out here<br> sipping Mai Tais...<br> ...shaking our hips, catching waves.<br> Are they insane?<br> Do they think we are<br> immune to life?<br> How can they possibly think<br> our families are less screwed up...<br> Our cancers less fatal...<br> Our heartache less painful.<br> Hell, I haven't been on<br> a surfboard in 15 years.<br> For the last 23 days...<br> ...I've been living in a paradise of IVs...<br> ...and urine bags and<br> endotracheal tubes.<br> Paradise.<br> Paradise can go fuck itself.<br> This is Elizabeth Thorson King.<br> My wife.<br> a powerboat during a race and hit her head.<br> Almost drowned.<br> When I heard about the accident<br> and about the coma...<br> ...I wasn't even in town.<br> I was on Maui on business.<br> We hadn't spoken in 3 days.<br> In a way, we hadn't<br> really spoken in months.<br> If you're doing this to get<br> my attention, Liz, It's working.<br> I'm ready now...<br> I am ready to talk,<br> I am ready to change...<br> I'm ready to be your<br> real husband and a real father.<br> Just wake up...<br> Please, Liz, just wake up.<br> Hi, Noe, what's up?<br> Matt, Scottie's teacher's on the phone.<br> She says it's urgent.<br> Okay, Put her on.<br> We don't think<br> these photographs are appropriate...<br> ...for Scottie to be sharing<br> with her classmates.<br> Some of them<br> went home quite disturbed...<br> ...and we've got some<br> angry calls from parents.<br> Yeah, she's kind of<br> been going to town...<br> ...on this whole<br> picture-taking thing, I had no idea-<br> Mr. King.<br> We see this every day.<br> Children acting out at school<br> when something's wrong at home.<br> And your family is<br> facing a devastating crisis.<br> Have you been engaging Scottie<br> in really talking about what's going on?<br> Yes. Yes. Absolutely.<br> Encouraging her<br> to express her feelings?<br> - That's crucial.<br> - I understand.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Showing those pictures of Mom<br> for your art project?<br> I'm a photographer, Dad,<br> a real photographer.<br> No, you're not.<br> You're overdoing it is what you're doing.<br> I saw it in a book.<br> Some famous photographer lady<br> took pictures of her mom in the hospital...<br> ...While she was dying,<br> and they're considered art.<br> That's what I'm doing.<br> First of all, your mother's very sick,<br> but she's not dying.<br> And second of all, we don't share<br> personal stuff with strangers.<br> What's going on<br> with Mom is private.<br> - I'm hungry. Can we get burgers?<br> - No.<br> The last time I took care of Scottie<br> by myself was when she was one 30.<br> Now she's 10.<br> And I have no idea<br> what to do with her.<br> I want to eat now,<br> not in an hour.<br> And with Elizabeth in the hospital,<br> she's testing me.<br> I'm the backup parent.<br> The understudy.<br> This's Matt King, I'm returning your call.<br> How can I help you?<br> It's your daughter, Scottie.<br> She's been texting some<br> awful things to My daughter, Lani...<br> ...and I'd like her to stop.<br> Huh.<br> Here's the latest one. "We all know<br> you grew pubes over the summer. "<br> I mean, my daughter can't help that<br> she's developing a little early for her age.<br> Do you think that's nice?<br> Oh, That's not like her at all.<br> She's usually very sweet.<br> As you may know, her mother isn't well,<br> maybe this is how she's dealing with it.<br> I'm very sorry about<br> your family situation, Mr. King...<br> ...But my daughter comes home<br> from school in tears.<br> Yeah, no, I get it. I'm sorry.<br> Scottie's the one who should be sorry.<br> I want her to come over<br> and apologize...<br> ...and I don't ever want her<br> to text my daughter again.<br> If she doesn't apologize,<br> I'll take it up with the dean.<br> You can't buy<br> your way out of this.<br> Can you give me an address?<br> Thank you for coming by.<br> Hi.<br> I forgot to mention<br> the time Scottie said...<br> ...she didn't want to be<br> Lani's partner at the rock wall...<br> ...because she didn't want to<br> fall into my daughter's butt crack.<br> That doesn't even make sense.<br> Scottie...<br> Do you have something<br> you want to say to Lani?<br> Sorry.<br> It's okay.<br> Great.<br> Well, nice meeting you both.<br> Lani, you should come over<br> to our house sometime.<br> For a swim or a hike or something.<br> I don't think she's sorry at all.<br> She's going to keep on<br> doing it. I can tell.<br> No, she won't.<br> Look... Scottie,<br> you're gonna stop, right?<br> And you're really really sorry, right?<br> - Oh, and Mr. King?<br> - Yes?<br> Good luck with the sale.<br> They say your decision<br> will have a major impact...<br> ...on Hawaiis real estate world.<br> Not to mention the whole<br> landscape of Kauai.<br> Hundreds of millions of dollars, yeah?<br> Yeah, it's a big decision.<br> My husband's family is from Kauai.<br> Hanapepe, born and bred.<br> They hope you don't sell.<br> You don't say.<br> All the traffic it's gonna make.<br> As if Liz's coma weren't enough already...<br> The whole goddamned state<br> is following my decision...<br> ...on who's gonna buy<br> ...that my family has<br> owned since the 1860s.<br> A lot of my cousins are broke and<br> the sale will make us all very very rich.<br> My family meets in 6 days<br> to approve a buyer.<br> But ever since my father died,<br> I'm the sole trustee.<br> Which means I alone<br> hold all the cards.<br> My great-great-grandmother was<br> Princess Margaret Ke'alohilani,<br> One of the last direct descendants<br> of King Kamehameha.<br> She was originally<br> supposed to marry her cousin...<br> ...but she fell in love with<br> Edward King, her haole banker...<br> ...whose parents were missionaries.<br> Between his land deals<br> and her huge inheritance...<br> ...generations of their<br> descendants, all of us...<br> ...have watched the past unfurl millions<br> into our laps through leases and sales.<br> Now something called<br> the Rule Against Perpetuities...<br> ...is forcing us to dissolve the trust.<br> We're selling our last huge parcel of<br> virgin Hawaiian land.<br> Unlike a lot of of my cousins,<br> I havent blown my share of the trust money.<br> Just like my father before me...<br> I live only on the income<br> from my law practice.<br> I don't want my daughters<br> growing up spoiled and entitled.<br> Liz always accuses me of being stinginess,<br> but I agree with my father:<br> You give your children<br> enough money to do something...<br> ...but not enough to do nothing.<br> Matt, your cousins are here.<br> Not only am I the sole trustee...<br> ...but I specialize in real<br> estate transactional low.<br> So a few of the more involved cousins...<br> ...have been meeting with me<br> regularly to analyze the bids.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey, guys.<br> Cousin Hal...<br> Cousin Milo...<br> Cousin Stan...<br> Cousin Six...<br> Cousin Wink...<br> Cousin Connie.<br> Okay.<br> And Cousin Dave, both of whom<br> oppose the sale entirely.<br> Good to see you.<br> Don't be fooled by appearances.<br> In Hawai'i some of the most powerful people<br> look like bums and stuntmen.<br> Alright, so, where are we?<br> The proposals are virtually the same.<br> Hotels, shopping centers,<br> condos and golf courses.<br> I have some major concerns...<br> A Chicago group is offering<br> half a billion dollars...<br> But we're leaning toward a lower bid<br> from a guy named Don Holitzer.<br> He's actually from Kauai...<br> ...made a fortune in Silicon Valley.<br> Old cousin Hugh is pushing us<br> in that direction, and I say why not?<br> The money will come from<br> Hawaii and stay in Hawaii.<br> Elizabeth's gonna<br> make it out okay. I know it.<br> It's not her time yet.<br> She'll wake up, Scottie and Alexandra<br> will have their mother back...<br> ...and we'll talk about our marriage.<br> I know I can make things right.<br> I'll sell the land and quit my practice<br> and buy her whatever she wants:<br> A big boat,<br> a house in France...<br> We'll take a trip around the world,<br> just the two of us.<br> We'll get close again...<br> ...like the early days.<br> I wish I had better news, Matthew.<br> But Dr. Chun and Dr. Mueller<br> and I agree that her condition...<br> ...is deteriorating.<br> She has no eye movements,<br> She has no pupillary responses...<br> She has no brainstem reflexes whatsoever.<br> The machines can keep her alive.<br> But the quality of her life<br> would be so poor...<br> Basically the way it is now.<br> She'll never be the way<br> she was, Matt. Never.<br> We know that now.<br> Look...<br> I can't tell you how sorry<br> I am to tell you this.<br> And you do have your daughters.<br> There's just nothing<br> more that we can do.<br> So if we do go ahead and<br> take her off the machines -<br> There is no if.<br> It's When. I have a legal<br> obligation, You know that.<br> How long will she last?<br> That's hard to say.<br> Could be a few days,<br> Could be a couple of weeks.<br> For planning purposes, I think you should<br> work off the shortest possible scenario.<br> I know I've got to get the ball rolling<br> on the organ donations right away.<br> Matt...<br> Elizabeth has many friends...<br> She has a big life.<br> If you're gonna let everybody<br> know to say goodbye which is...<br> ...the typical protocol for these<br> situations, you start now.<br> Then when the last day comes...<br> ...they feel more ready.<br> As ready as they<br> can feel for something like this.<br> I'm so sorry, Matt.<br> - Hey!<br> - Hey!<br> There he is!<br> How's it going?<br> What's going on?<br> Oh, she's been looking a little pale<br> lately all cooped up in here and...<br> ...I just know she'd be mortified if nobody<br> helped her out with some lipstick and blush.<br> I know she'll grill me.<br> And of course Kai's getting her<br> all caught up on all the latest gossip.<br> Well, I don't want to<br> start from scratch later.<br> Oh, and Matt,<br> on the way here we stopped by...<br> ...and putted some meals<br> in your fridge, all ready to nuke.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Mmhmm.<br> So what's the latest anyway, Matt?<br> Any updates?<br> Just more of the same.<br> just keeping her kidneys...<br> ...and other vital organs working,<br> And hoping for the best.<br> ocean outrigger club<br> The food at the club is so good.<br> Yeah, they do a good job here.<br> Why is it called a jellyfish?<br> It's not a fish,<br> it's not jelly.<br> I have no idea.<br> You ask good questions, Scottie.<br> You're getting too smart for me.<br> I'm gonna ask Mom<br> when she wakes up.<br> Do you think she's gonna<br> know everything she used to?<br> I don't know.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Hi, Matt.<br> Hi, Scottie.<br> Troy.<br> So, what's going on?<br> I mean, how's Elizabeth doing?<br> The same.<br> Well, you know, I went and<br> visited her last week and...<br> I thought she looked pretty good.<br> Then why'd you ask?<br> I don't know, I guess I just<br> wanted to know what the latest is.<br> And I've been praying for her every day...<br> ...you guys. Really hard. Seriously.<br> What I meant to say was, when<br> I was there, I talked to her and she...<br> ...She moved her hand and...<br> Then I was like... I was encouraged.<br> I thought that was an encouraging sign.<br> That's enough.<br> I really think she heard me.<br> Look, Troy...<br> Go to your friends.<br> There's no hard feelings.<br> Let's just leave it alone.<br> I told you, Matt.<br> The water that day was so choppy.<br> I told you a hundred times.<br> What happened to her<br> could have happened to me.<br> I mean the ocean was brutal that day.<br> You can ask anybody.<br> You weren't supposed to be driving,<br> She was supposed to be driving.<br> She wanted me to drive.<br> She's the one who told me to<br> pass the other boat before the turn.<br> You know, it's just your<br> whole attitude toward me.<br> I feel terrible about it.<br> Plus I almost drowned<br> myself when the boat caps -<br> Hey.<br> Scottie!<br> Hey! Scottie! Scottie!<br> Hey!<br> Listen.<br> Don't pay any attention to that guy.<br> That guy's a dope.<br> - I hate him.<br> - Yeah.<br> I know.<br> Hey. Let's do something crazy.<br> Alright?<br> let's drive over the airport...<br> We'll hop over to the Big Island<br> and we'll surprise your sister.<br> What do you say?<br> Right now?<br> Yes, it'll be fun.<br> She's not expecting us.<br> And... we can bring her home.<br> I think she should be<br> here with us, don't you?<br> Don't you miss her?<br> I miss her.<br> Yeah, I mean I'm out of school.<br> She should be too!<br> Okay. Let's go. Com on.<br> Hey, Troy.<br> Somehow it feels natural to find a<br> daughter of mine on a different island.<br> A family seems<br> exactly like an archipelago.<br> All part of the same whole,<br> but still separate and alone.<br> And always drifting slowly apart.<br> That's the wrong door.<br> Go back to sleep, Rylan.<br> It's ok.<br> Wake up to your roommate, please.<br> Um... Alex isn't here.<br> Where is she?<br> I think she's somewhere outside.<br> Where outside?<br> Hey, girls! What you guys<br> think you're doing out here?<br> Run!<br> - Fuck!<br> - Hi, Alex!<br> It's me, Scottie!<br> I pay $35,000 a year for this<br> kind of crap not to happen.<br> Alex!<br> Dad?<br> - My fucking dad is here!<br> - You need to watch your language.<br> This is unacceptable behavior.<br> What's up, Dad?<br> What's happening?<br> You need to come home<br> and see your Mom.<br> Fuck Mom!<br> Really? What did I just say<br> about the language?<br> You could get expelled for all of this.<br> What is it that makes the women<br> in my life wanna destroy themselves?<br> Elizabeth with her<br> motorcycles and speedboats...<br> ...and drinking.<br> Alexandra with her<br> drugs and older guys.<br> And Scottie...<br> ...with Elizabeth gone...<br> What kind of a chance<br> will she have with just me?<br> Go to bed.<br> All right.<br> Here we go.<br> I don't like eggs.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> before I made them?<br> I thought they were for you.<br> Good morning.<br> How're you feeling?<br> Hangover?<br> Why am I not surprised?<br> I thought you were supposed to be<br> getting your act together.<br> I have gotten my act together.<br> I was just drinking.<br> I've been doing really well, actually.<br> Nobody ever seems to notice that.<br> My grades are better...<br> How I was in that stupid play<br> that you guys didn't even bother to see.<br> Do you even<br> remember the name of it?<br> That's what I thought.<br> So what? What if I got drunk on the<br> one night you happened to stop by?<br> So fucking what?<br> Hey, hey. Watch your<br> language around Scottie.<br> I don't care.<br> Anyway.<br> Listen.<br> it's nice to see you.<br> Welcome home.<br> Want some eggs?<br> I can't believe that.<br> What?<br> Oh, my God!<br> Aha...<br> Alex?<br> What did she say?<br> Can I talk to you for a minute?<br> The pool's really dirty.<br> Aha...<br> Wait... what?<br> - Hey.<br> - No.<br> I really need to talk to you.<br> She didn't say anything to me.<br> Aha...<br> Oh my God, I can't believe...<br> Hey, yeah...

Just call them.<br> Alex, nobody<br> wants to do any of this.<br> But we have to tell your Grandpa<br> and Tutu, and a few friends.<br> They have the right to know,<br> They have the right to say goodbye.<br> I don't wanna talk<br> about Mom with anyone.<br> Look, whatever you two fought about<br> over Christmas, you have to drop it.<br> Grow up.<br> You love your mother.<br> Your mother loves you.<br> I can't drop it.<br> You have to.<br> You really don't have a clue, do you?<br> Dad...<br> Dad, mom was cheating on you.<br> That's what we fought about.<br> When I was over at Christmas,<br> I caught her with the guy.<br> It made me sick<br> to see her near you.<br> I went back to school<br> thinking that that was it...<br> ...that I was just done with her.<br> I was gonna call and<br> tell you everything, and...<br> ...and then the accident<br> happened, and...<br> ...I was waiting until<br> she woke up, I guess.<br> You didn't even suspect. Right?<br> Right?<br> You disgusted me too.<br> You're always so busy.<br> Caught her with a guy?<br> What does that mean?<br> I was on my way to swim in<br> the Black Point pool with Brandy...<br> ...and suddenly I see Mom and<br> some douche-bag walking into a house.<br> His house, I guess.<br> Just some guy?<br> It could be anybody.<br> Yeah, he had his hand on her ass.<br> It was gross.<br> Then what?<br> Then nothing.<br> Then they went into the house.<br> A few days later I told her<br> I knew what she was doing.<br> And?<br> And first she acted like she<br> had no idea what I was talking about.<br> Like I'm fucking blind.<br> Then she got like super-mad<br> and yelled and denied it.<br> That is when I decided I didn't want<br> anything more to do with her.<br> Who is he?<br> I don't know. Some guy.<br> What did he look like?<br> Dark hair.<br> Watch your sister.<br> Hello?<br> Kai?<br> Mark?<br> It's me, Matt!<br> Hey!<br> Hello!<br> Wait...

You want some coffee?<br> You want something to drink?<br> No, thanks.<br> - Fighting about something stupid.<br> - It is not stupid.<br> He wants us to throw parties and<br> have people over, which we do, of course...<br> ...but who winds up doing<br> all the work? Me.<br> You don't have to do anything.<br> - That's the whole point!<br> - Yes, I do.<br> It's doesn't have to be work.<br> You don't have to...<br> ...clean and buy a new outfit.<br> - Oh, I'm supposed to leave...<br> - ... and think of the...<br> ...goddamn theme cocktail<br> for every party.<br> We can just invite people over<br> to hang out and drink whatever we have.<br> Let's talk about it later.<br> Oh, shit, Matt, is everything okay?<br> Is there any news?<br> In fact there is.<br> I'll tell you about it in a moment.<br> Who is he?<br> Does she love him?<br> Who is he?<br> Matt...<br> I'm sorry to put you in that position.<br> But I'm not really the one<br> who put you there, am I?<br> I'd like to know who the guy is<br> that my wife was... seeing.<br> Matt, you're angry.<br> You have very keen<br> powers of observation.<br> Wow.

Let them play a while<br> longer.<br> Awesome cottage youre renting.<br> Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location.<br> I used to come here as a kid before it<br> was a vacation property.<br> Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian<br> built it back in the 20s.<br> Havent been<br> inside in years.<br> Come on. Well give you a tour.<br> Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad a little<br> walk down memory lane, and Julie and I can chat out here.<br> Yeah, Id like that, if you dont mind.<br> Just a quick look.<br> Yes. But its not like I live here anything.<br> but OK<br> Can you keep it?<br> Go from here.<br> Here it is.<br> How did you meet? Im curious<br> I cant do this.<br> Neither can I. How did you meet?<br> I thought you said you came here just<br> to tell me.<br> I changed my mind. And I cant very<br> well ask her the details. can I<br> Howd you meet?<br> At a party.<br> - What party?<br> Super Bowl party<br> At the Mitchells<br> Does that help? Does that make it<br> better?<br> Hey, Im doing you a favor here. I<br> could go out there right now and fuck you up,<br> so get a better attitude.<br> Then what?<br> Howd you get the nerve to ask<br> her out?<br> Was it about the deal?<br> Is that when you decided she was for you?<br> No.<br> Its not what you think.<br> It just happened.<br> Nothing just happens.<br> Everything just happens.<br> Was she going to leave me?<br> She would have.<br> But I, I, uh... I<br> didnt want that happened.<br> I love Julie.<br> Please dont tell her.<br> Please.<br> I dont know what Ive done. Im sorry.<br> Did she say she loved you?<br> Do you love her?<br> You dont love her.<br> You dont love<br> her. You just used her to get to me.<br> No, I told you. I wasnt trying to get<br> to you.<br> It was an affair,<br> an attraction. Sex. And she got sort of... carried away<br> with the whole thing, and I guess I went with it.<br> I mean, I didnt exactly<br> say no to things. I should have. I love my family.<br> Then I guess its all working out. Her lips are sealed,<br> and you dont have to go through the trouble of dumping her.<br> Hey, hey, thats really unfair. I had..<br> have... a lot of respect for her.<br> Shes a wonderful woman.<br> One more question for you<br> Yes?<br> Have you ever been inside my bedroom?<br> Once.<br> You could have had the decency to lie<br> about that one.<br> Okay, two.<br> Well, shes in Queens<br> Hospital if you want to say goodbye.<br> That really is all I came to say.<br> that's great, all remodeled, new<br> appliances.<br> Nice.<br> Alex, I think we should go.<br> Well, hey, thanks for stopping by.<br> Really nice to meet you both. Maybe<br> well see you at the beach tomorrow.<br> Yes, maybe.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> Hey.<br> So when do you think hell show up?<br> I have no idea.<br> Was he sorry?<br> I hope he was sorry, man.<br> You could have told his wife, and<br> you didnt.<br> I would say everything. I mean..<br> I hope he knows how lucky he is.<br> She deserves to know.<br> Or else shes going to be a dumb bitch the<br> rest of her life.<br> Sid.<br> Im just saying.<br> No need to get creepy about it<br> Anyway, doesnt<br> matter. Thats all behind us.<br> Yeah, the one we have to worry about<br> telling things to now is Scottie.<br> Ive asked Dr. Johnston to help us<br> break the news tomorrow.<br> Here we are.<br> Hey.<br> - Hey, Barry.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi, Alice.<br> - Hey, Barry.<br> - Hi, Alex.<br> - Glad to see you.<br> Scott.<br> Hi, Tutu.<br> Alex, we will... e.. bring some<br> chairs for Tutu, right?<br> There you are again.<br> so...<br> what did you decide?<br> Theres not much left to decide.<br> Were just sort of playing it by ear and<br> making sure shes comfortable.<br> I mean what did you decide about the<br> buyer?<br> Whos your buyer?<br> How much are you getting?<br> Dad...<br> Im sure youll be able to read<br> about it in the paper.<br> I dont need to read about it. I can<br> hear about it right now.<br> Scott, lets not talk about that here.<br> Its not the time for that.<br> All the same to you, I guess. A<br> million here, a million there.<br> Just ironic, thats all<br> Elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as youre<br> coming into a fortune.<br> She gave you<br> everything, Matt.<br> A good, happy home,<br> two beautiful daughters.<br> Scott, whats your point?<br> She wanted her own boat. She should<br> have had her own boat,<br> - one she would have been familiar with.<br> - She wasnt even driving!<br> Her boat,<br> someone elses boat... it wouldnt matter<br> Youre not going<br> to blame me for this.<br> quibble about the details.<br> She was a faithful, devoted wife. She<br> deserved more.<br> Youre right. She deserved more.<br> For Christs sake,<br> take it easy on the man.<br> You know, My father has been doing a really<br> amazing job under the circumstances.<br> Are we leaving?<br> No, Mom, not yet.<br> Man, that guys a prick.<br> Was he always<br> like that?<br> Yes.<br> Well, no surprise. Other than the<br> hold outs who dont want to sell at all,<br> its Don Holitzer.<br> Chicago group a distant second.<br> Feels good.<br> Were doing the right thing, Mattie.<br> At least there aint going to be any<br> Wal-Mart.<br> All right.<br> Now its your call, and<br> were all behind you,<br> most of us anyway.<br> Go ahead, Captain. Make it official.<br> Its strange, thats all.<br> Whats strange?<br> We didnt do anything to own that land.<br> It was entrusted to us.<br> And now were just...<br> I cant do it.<br> I wont do it.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Im not going to sign.<br> Whatre you doing, Matt?<br> I mean, we know you have a lot on your plate right now,<br> but youre not going to fuck this up for us.<br> Its over.<br> I dont want it to go to Holitzer.<br> I dont want it to go to anyone.<br> I want to keep it.<br> Your heads not right, Mattie.<br> Your heads not right.<br> You want a couple<br> days to think it over? Take a couple days.<br> dont need a couple days. I have the<br> authority, and this is what I want.<br> We have other businesses were<br> converting to corporations. We can figure it out.<br> Youre the trustee.<br> You know better than anyone we<br> only have seven years left.<br> Then I have seven years to figure out<br> how to keep it.<br> Well come after you.<br> Just because youre a lawyer doesnt mean the rest<br> of us would be afraid to come after you.<br> But nobody wants to do that.<br> Were family.<br> People will be relieved, Hugh, the<br> whole state.<br> I sign that document, Something<br> that was ours to protect will be gone.<br> were haole as shit<br> and go to private schools and clubs and cant<br> even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian,<br> But we have Hawaiian blood.<br> and were still tied to this land.<br> And our children are tied to this land.<br> Its a miracle that for whatever bullshit<br> reason 150 years ago, we own this much of... paradise, but we do.<br> And for whatever bullshit reason now,<br> Im the trustee.<br> And Im not signing.<br> And if you sue me, itll only make us closer.<br> All right.<br> everybody, listen up.<br> Cousin Mattie has an announcement.<br> Get ready.<br> come in<br> Julie?<br> I know we just met, but I was thinking<br> about you guys these past few days,<br> I knew your mom was here. I dont<br> know. I just felt I should stop by.<br> You remember Alex.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> This is Scottie.<br> Sid. This is Mrs. Speer.<br> Julie.<br> Julie.<br> Were you friends with my mom?<br> No, we never met. But I know a lot<br> about her.<br> Look, Julie, we appreciate your coming by.<br> The flowers are lovely.<br> - Scottie, Alex. Lets go to the cafeteria.<br> - Okay. Yes.<br> Come get up Scotty.<br> - I come.<br> - Come on, Scotty.<br> I wanted two more seconds.<br> - Scotty.<br> - coming!<br> I, uh, Im not sure how much you know<br> about my wifes condition,<br> but shes<br> going to die very soon.<br> Basically for this reason we are here.<br> I know.<br> Thats why I came. Because I<br> know.<br> I came because Brian wouldnt.<br> And that just didnt seem right. I thought someone from my<br> family should come.<br> So he told you, huh?<br> he was acting really weird. that night,<br> After you left Then I started smelling it all over him.<br> Id already smelled it.<br> I finally got it out of him. Weve<br> been going crazy ever since.<br> Not easy<br> with the kids around.<br> Its all<br> something I never could have imagined.<br> And then your familys decision about<br> the land. I think youre doing the right thing,<br> but Brian is... well, its<br> all so complicated and confusing.<br> I know.<br> Im angry,<br> but Im just so sorry.<br> I cant imagine what youre going<br> through.<br> Do you mind if I say<br> something to her?<br> Ok<br> Elizabeth, Im Julie.<br> Brians wife.<br> I just wanted to tell you...<br> I just want to tell you I forgive you.<br> I forgive you for trying to take Brian away<br> I forgive you for almost destroying my<br> family.<br> Why should I forgive you...<br> I have to forgive you.<br> Even though I want to hate you.<br> Okay. Thats enough,<br> I have to forgive you.<br> Frankly, I think that is enough.<br> Okay? Come, go.<br> Thank you, Julie.<br> He didnt love her. Just so you know.<br> He didnt really love her.<br> That's why I came.<br> All right.<br> Goodbye, Elizabeth.<br> Goodbye, my love.<br> my friend,<br> my pain,<br> my joy.<br> Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> I guess that is<br> are very few places that are difficult<br> can go in this world...<br> ...but there are others<br> be more difficult to live.<br> The average temperature here in the bottom<br> of the earth is about 50 degrees below.<br> With strawberry.<br> one scoop mocha chip.<br> Great.<br> Antarctica used to be tropical place.<br> With dense forests and bustling.<br> But then the continents<br> began to move south.<br> And to finish the move forests<br> were replaced by a new territory.<br> Ice<br> As for the old residents, all<br> died or moved long ago.<br> Basically, almost all of them.<br> The royal penguin<br> is essentially a bird.<br> Only he makes<br> the home of the sea.<br> And if you wonder what<br> done here on the ice, then...<br> This is another story.<br> is here around the same time<br> who wants to leave the ocean's house<br> and begin a memorable trip.<br> They traveled a long distance...<br>
