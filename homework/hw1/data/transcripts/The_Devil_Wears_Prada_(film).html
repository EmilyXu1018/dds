Uh, I have an appointment<br> with Emily Charlton?<br> - Andrea Sachs?<br> - Yes.<br> Great. Human Resources certainly<br> has an odd sense of humor.<br> Follow me.<br> Okay, so I was Miranda's<br> second assistant...<br> but her first assistant recently got promoted,<br> and so now I'm the first.<br> - Oh, and you're replacing yourself.<br> - Well, I am trying.<br> Miranda sacked the last two girls<br> after only a few weeks.<br> We need to find someone who can survive here.<br> Do you understand?<br> Yeah. Of course. Who's Miranda?<br> Oh, my God. I will pretend<br> you did not just ask me that.<br> She's the editor in chief of Runway,<br> not to mention a legend.<br> You work a year for her, and you can<br> get a job at any magazine you want.<br> A million girls would kill for this job.<br> It sounds like a great opportunity.<br> I'd love to be considered.<br> [ Giggling ]<br> Andrea,<br> Runway is a fashion magazine...<br> so an interest in fashion is crucial.<br> What makes you think<br> I'm not interested in fashion?<br> - [ Cell Phone Ringing ]<br> - Oh, my God.<br> No! No! No!<br> What's wrong?<br> She's on her way. Tell everyone!<br> She's not supposed to be here<br> until 9:00.<br> Her driver just text messaged,<br> and her facialist ruptured a disk.<br> - God, these people!<br> - [ Whistles, Whispers ] Who's that?<br> That I can't even talk about.<br> All right, everyone! Gird your loins!<br> - [ Excited Chattering ]<br> - Did somebody eat an onion bagel?<br> [ Exhales, Sniffs ]<br> [ Bell Dings ]<br> Sorry, Miranda.<br> [ Bell Dings ]<br> Move it! Ooh!<br> I don't understand why it's so difficult<br> to confirm an appointment.<br> I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda.<br> I actually did confirm last night.<br> Details of your incompetence<br> do not interest me.<br> Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl<br> that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.<br> I asked for clean, athletic, smiling.<br> She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.<br> And R.S.V.P. Yes<br> to the Michael Kors party.<br> I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30<br> and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.<br> - [ Whispers ] 9:45 sharp.<br> - Call Natalie at Glorious Foods,<br> tell her no for the 40th time.<br> No, I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes<br> filled with warm rhubarb compote.<br> Then call my ex-husband and remind him the<br> parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight.<br> Then call my husband, ask him to meet me<br> for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.<br> Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent<br> for that feature on the female paratroopers...<br> and they're all so deeply unattractive.<br> Is it impossible to find a lovely,<br> slender female paratrooper?<br> - No.<br> - Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.<br> Also, I need to see all the things that Nigel<br> has pulled for Gwyneth's second cover try<br> I wonder if she's lost any<br> of that weight yet Who's that?<br> Nobody. Um, uh-<br> Human Resources sent her up about the new<br> assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.<br> But she's hopeless<br> and totally wrong for it.<br> Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself<br> because the last two you sent me...<br> were completely inadequate<br> So send her in. That's all.<br> Right.<br> - She wants to see you.<br> - Oh! She does?<br> Move!<br> - This is foul. Don't let her see it.

That wasn't a question.<br> Um, I was editor in chief<br> of the Daily Northwestern<br> I also, um, won a national competition<br> for college journalists...<br> with my series on thejanitors'union,<br> which exposed the exploitation-<br> That's all<br> [ Scoffs ]<br> Yeah.

I don't fit in here.<br> I am not skinny or glamorous...<br> and I don't know that much<br> about fashion<br> But I'm smart<br> I learn fast<br> and I will work very hard.<br> I got the exclusive<br> on the Cavalli for Gwyneth...<br> but the problem is, with that huge<br> feathered headdress that she's wearing...<br> she looks like she's working<br> the main stage at the Golden Nugget.<br> Thank you for your time.<br> Who is that sad little person?<br> Are we doing a before-and-after piece<br> I don't know about?<br> Brown and Law, please?<br> Thank you.<br> - Andrea.<br> - Hmm?<br> Wait You got a job<br> at a fashion magazine?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - What was it, a phone interview?<br> - [ Woman ] Wow<br> - Ow!

Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets<br> and pulled up the Sedona shoot.<br> What's that costing me?<br> About 300,000.<br> Must have been some lousy jackets.<br> - Irv Ravitz.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> This is Andy Sachs,<br> Miranda's new assistant.<br> Congratulations, young lady.<br> A million girls would kill for that job.<br> Bye-bye.<br> - Hmm?<br> - Chairman of Elias-Clarke, Irv Ravitz.<br> You know what they say?<br> Tiny man, huge ego.<br> No. And I've seen all this before.<br> Theyskens is trying to reinvent<br> the drop waist, so actually it's-<br> - Where are all the other dresses?<br> - We have some right here<br> - Stand, watch and listen.<br> - And I think it can be very interesting-<br> No. No, I just-<br> It's just baffling to me.<br> Why is it so impossible<br> to put together a decent run-through?<br> You people have had hours and hours<br> to prepare It's just so confusing to me<br> Where are the advertisers?<br> - We have some pieces from Banana Republic.<br> - We need more, don't we?<br> - Oh. This is-This might be-<br> What do you think of-<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, you know me<br> Give me a full ballerina skirt<br> and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.<br> - But do you think it's too much like-<br> - Like the Lacroix from July?<br> I thought that, but no, not with<br> the right accessories. It should work.<br> Where are the belts for this dre-<br> Why is no one ready?<br> Here. It's a tough call.<br> - They're so different.<br> - [ Miranda ] Hmm<br> [ Snorts, Chuckles ]<br> Something funny?<br> No. No, no. Nothing's-<br> You know, it's just that both those belts<br> look exactly the same to me.<br> You know, I'm still learning<br> about this stuff and, uh-<br> "This... stuff'?<br> Oh Okay I see<br> You think this has nothing<br> to do with you.<br> You go to your closet<br> and you select- I don't know-<br> that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...<br> because you're trying to tell the world<br> that you take yourself too seriously<br> to care about what<br> you put on your back.<br> But what you don't know<br> is that that sweater is not just blue.<br> It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.<br> It's actually cerulean.<br> And you're also blithely unaware<br> of the fact...<br> that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta<br> did a collection of cerulean gowns<br> And then I think it was<br> Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it-<br> who showed cerulean military jackets?<br> - I think we need a jacket here.<br> - Mmm.<br> And then cerulean quickly showed up<br> in the collections of eight different designers<br> And then it, uh, filtered down<br> through the department stores<br> and then trickled on down<br> into some tragic Casual Corner...<br> and then trickled on down<br> into some tragic Casual Corner...<br> where you, no doubt,<br> fished it out of some clearance bin<br> However, that blue represents<br> millions of dollars<br> and countless jobs...<br> and it's sort of comical how you think<br> that you've made a choice...<br> that exempts you<br> from the fashion industry...<br> when, in fact...<br> you're wearing a sweater that was selected<br> for you by the people in this room...<br> from a pile of stuff.<br> So then I said,<br> "No, I couldn't see the difference<br> between the two<br> absolutely identical belts".<br> And you should have seen<br> the look she gave me!<br> I thought the flesh<br> was gonna melt off her face.<br> - [ Chuckles ]<br> - It's not funny<br> She's not happy unless everyone around her<br> is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.<br> And the Clackers just worship her.<br> - The who?<br> - They call them Clackers<br> The sound that their stilettos make<br> in the marble lobby.<br> It's like,<br> "Clack, clack, clack. Clack, clack."<br> [ Groans ] And they all act like<br> they're curing cancer or something<br> [ Chuckling ]<br> The amount of time and energy...<br> that these people spend on these insignificant,<br> minute details, and for what?<br> So that tomorrow they can spend<br> another $300,000 reshooting something...<br> that was probably fine to begin with<br> to sell people things they don't need!<br> God!<br> - I'm not even hungry anymore.<br> - What?<br> - That is why those girls are so skinny.<br> - Oh No, no, no<br> Give me that. There's, like,<br> eight dollars ofJarlsberg in there.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> You know what?<br> I just have to stick it out for a year.<br> One year.<br> And then I can do<br> what I came to New York to do.<br> But I can't let Miranda get to me.<br> I won't.<br> Easy there, tiger.<br> - Oh, good morning, Miranda.<br> - Get me Isaac.<br> I don't see my breakfast here<br> Are my eggs here? Where are my eggs?<br> Excuse me!<br> Pick up the Polaroids<br> from the lingerie shoot<br> Have the brakes checked on my car<br> - [ Truck Horn Honking ]<br> - [ Gasps ]<br> Where's that piece of paper<br> I had in my hand yesterday morning?<br> The girls need new surfboards or<br> boogie boards or something for spring break<br> - Hello.<br> - The twins also need flip-flops.<br> - Ow!<br> - Oh, my gosh!<br> Pick up my shoes from Blahnik,<br> and then go get Patricia<br> - Who's that?<br> - Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!<br> Get me that little table<br> that I liked at that store on Madison.<br> Get us a reservation for dinner tonight<br> at that place that got the good review<br> - Get me Isaac<br> - Thirty-six thank-you notes delivered today<br> - Where is everyone?<br> - Why is no one working?<br> [ Miranda's Voice Overlapping ]<br> Get me Demarchelier.<br> I have Miranda Priestly calling for-<br> Okay.<br> I have Patrick.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> Thank God it's Friday, right?<br> At least Miranda will be in Miami,<br> so we don't have to be on call this weekend<br> You know,<br> my dad's coming in from Ohio.<br> Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner,<br> maybe see Chicago.<br> You doing anything fun this weekend?<br> Yes.<br> [ Piano ]<br> [ Andy ]<br> Yeah, Nate said it was great<br> He actually- He applied here, but they<br> wanted someone with more experience.<br> - Here.<br> - Huh?

It's okay.<br> Go right ahead.<br> We're just a little worried, honey.<br> We get e-mails from you<br> at your office at 2:00 a.m.<br> Your pay is terrible.<br> You don't get to write anything.<br> Hey, that's not fair.<br> I wrote those e-mails.<br> I'm just trying to understand why someone<br> who got accepted to Stanford Law...<br> turns it down to be a journalist,<br> and now you're not even doing that.<br> Dad, you have to trust me.<br> Being Miranda's assistant<br> opens a lot of doors.<br> Emily is going to Paris<br> with Miranda in a few months...<br> and she's gonna meet editors and writers<br> from every important magazine.<br> And in a year, that could be me.<br> - All right?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Dad, I swear, this is my break.<br> - This is my- my chance.<br> - [ Cell Phone Ringing ]<br> This is my boss.<br> - I'm sorry, Dad.

Could I do that?<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> The girls' recital<br> was absolutely wonderful.<br> They played Rachmaninoff.<br> Everyone loved it.<br> Everyone except me...<br> because, sadly, I was not there.<br> Miranda, I'm so sorry.<br> Do you know why I hired you?<br> I always hire the same girl-<br> stylish, slender, of course...<br> worships the magazine<br> But so often, they turn out to be-<br> I don't know- disappointing and, um...<br> stupid.<br> So you, with that impressive rsum<br> and the big speech<br> about your so-called work ethic-<br> I, um- I thought you<br> would be different.<br> I said to myself, go ahead<br> Take a chance.<br> Hire the smart, fat girl.<br> [ Clears Throat ]<br> I had hope<br> My God I live on it<br> Anyway, you ended up<br> disappointing me more than, um-<br> more than any of the other silly girls.<br> Um, I really did everything<br> I could think of.<br> - Uh-<br> - That's all.<br> Excuse me!<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> She hates me, Nigel.<br> And that's my problem because-<br> Oh, wait. No, it's not my problem.<br> I don't know what else I can do because<br> if I do something right, it's unacknowledged.<br> She doesn't even say thank you.<br> But if I do something wrong,<br> she is vicious<br> - So quit.<br> - What?<br> - Quit.<br> - Quit?<br> I can get another girl to take your job<br> in five minutes- one who really wants it.<br> No, I don't want to quit.<br> That's not fair.<br> But, you know, I'm just saying<br> that I would just like a little credit...<br> for the fact<br> that I'm killing myself trying.<br> Andy, be serious.<br> You are not trying.<br> - You are whining.<br> - L-<br> What is it that you want me<br> to say to you, huh?<br> Do you want me to say, "Poor you.<br> Miranda's picking on you. Poor you. Poor Andy"?<br> Hmm?

Darling, shall we?<br> We have to get to the beauty department,<br> and God knows how long that's going to take.<br> [ Groans ]<br> I mean, I have no idea<br> why Miranda hired her.<br> Me neither. The other day,<br> we were in the beauty department.<br> She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler<br> and said, "What is this?"<br> [ Laughing ]<br> I just knew<br> from the moment I saw her...<br> she was going to be<br> a complete and utter disas-<br> - [ Phone Rings ]<br> - Miranda Priestly's office.<br> No, actually, she's not available,<br> but I'll leave word<br> Okay, thanks.

You put all your junk in it,<br> and that's it. You're done.<br> Fashion is not about utility.<br> An accessory is merely<br> a piece of iconography...<br> used to express individual identity.<br> - Oh! And it's pretty.<br> - That too.<br> Yeah. But the thing is, it turns out there is<br> more to Runway than just fancy purses.<br> Look, here's an essay byJay Mclnerney,<br> a piece byJoan Didion<br> Even an interview<br> with Christiane Amanpour<br> - Looks like someone's been drinking the Kool-Aid.<br> - What do you-<br> - [ Cell Phone Ringing ]<br> - I got it.

Well.<br> - Wise.<br> - [ Chuckling ]<br> - Uh, hi.<br> - Christian Thompson.<br> Christian Thompson?<br> You're kidding.<br> No, you're-You write for,<br> like, every magazine I love.<br> I actually- I reviewed your collection<br> of essays for my college newspaper.<br> Did you mention my good looks<br> and my killer charm?<br> - No, but-<br> - What do you do?<br> Oh. Well, I want to work for somewhere<br> like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair<br> - I am a writer too.<br> - Is that right?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - I should read your stuff.<br> Why don't you send it over?<br> Yeah?<br> That would be-Thank you.<br> That would be great. [ Giggling ]<br> But actually, right now, I'm working<br> as Miranda Priestly's assistant.<br> Oh, you're kidding.<br> Well, that's too bad.<br> That's-Whoa.<br> You'll never survive Miranda.<br> - Excuse me?<br> - Well, you seem nice, smart.<br> You can't do that job.<br> Gotta go.<br> Okay.<br> Well, it was very, very nice<br> to meet you, Miranda girl.<br> Emily?<br> Call James Holt's office Tell them I want<br> to move the preview up to today at 12::30<br> Tell everybody else.<br> Be ready to leave in half an hour.<br> But we're not expected until Tuesday<br> Did she say why?<br> Yes.

I'm appalled.<br> - It's absurd. Appalled.<br> - You deal with it.<br> - I'll talk to him.<br> So because she pursed her lips,<br> he's gonna change his entire collection?<br> You still don't get it, do you?<br> Her opinion is the only one<br> that matters.<br> - Call my husband and confirm dinner.<br> - At Pastis?

And she's bringing me in<br> to run all the editorial content.<br> You're really surprised?<br> Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.<br> She has a fresher take on things.<br> Not to mention American Runway's one<br> of the most expensive books in the business<br> Jacqueline does the same thing<br> for a lot less money<br> And Irv-<br> Irv's a businessman, you know.<br> Miranda will be devastated. Her whole life<br> is about Runway He can't do that to her.<br> It's done. Irv's gonna tell Miranda<br> after the party forJames.<br> And she has no idea?<br> She's a big girl. She'll be fine.<br> Shi- I have to go.<br> Andy.<br> Andy, it's done.<br> Baby, it's done.<br> I'm not your baby.<br> - [ Phone Ringing ]<br> - Allo<br> Oh! Oh! Thank God you're there.<br> - [ Sighs ] Excuse me?<br> - I need to talk to you right away.<br> It's aboutJacqueline Follet.<br> Shit! Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit!<br> - Yes.<br> - Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry to bother you.<br> I was wondering-<br> Have you completely lost your mind?<br> - I need to talk to you.<br> - Do not disturb me again.<br> But, um, it's just for one- Miranda!<br> [ Horn Honks ]<br> Miranda. Miranda.<br> Wait, I need to talk to you.<br> Irv is making Jacqueline Follet<br> the editor in chief of Runway<br> Christian Thompson told me<br> he's gonna work for her.<br> Irv is going to tell you today. I thought<br> maybe if I told you, that you could fix it.<br> Do I smell freesias?<br> What? No.<br> L-I specifically told them-<br> If I see freesias anywhere...<br> I will be very disappointed.<br> For 72 years, Runway<br> has been more than a magazine<br> It has been a beacon<br> of elegance and grace.<br> Miranda Priestly is the finest<br> possible guardian of that beacon<br> setting a standard that inspires<br> people across the globe<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I give you Miranda Priestly.<br> Thank you, my dear friend.<br> Bonjour<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Thank you very much<br> for coming today<br> to help celebrate<br> our dear friend, James Holt.<br> But before I talk to you aboutJames...<br> and his many accomplishments...<br> I would like first to share<br> some news with you.<br> Um, as many of you know<br> uh, recently Massimo Corteleoni...<br> has agreed to finance the expansion<br> of theJames Holt label<br> transforming the work<br> of this visionary artist...<br> into a global brand,<br> which is really an exciting enterprise.<br> Runway and James Holt share<br> many things in common<br> chief among them,<br> a commitment to excellence.<br> And so, it should come as no surprise<br> that when the time came...<br> forJames to choose the new president<br> ofJames Holt International...<br> he chose from within<br> the Runway family<br> And it's my great happiness today<br> to announce to you all<br> that that person...<br> is my friend<br> and longtime esteemed colleague<br> Jacqueline Follet.<br> Thank you. Merci<br> And now to the main event<br> our celebration ofJames Holt<br> We at Runway<br> are very proud to have been-<br> When the time is right,<br> she'll pay me back.<br> You sure about that?<br> No.<br> But I hope for the best.<br> I have to.<br> [ Clamoring ]<br> You thought I didn't know.<br> I've known what was happening<br> for quite some time.<br> Itjust took me a little while to find<br> a suitable alternative forJacqueline<br> And thatJames Holtjob<br> was so absurdly overpaid<br> that, of course, she jumped at it.<br> So I just had to tell Irv<br> thatJacqueline was unavailable<br> The truth is, there is no one<br> that can do what I do...<br> including her.<br> Any of the other choices would<br> have found that job impossible...<br> and the magazine would have suffered.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> Especially because of the list.<br> The list of designers, photographers...<br> editors, writers, models, all of whom<br> were found by me, nurtured by me<br> and have promised me<br> they will follow me...<br> whenever and if ever<br> I choose to leave Runway<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> So he reconsidered<br> But I was very, very impressed<br> by how intently you tried to warn me.<br> I never thought I would say this,<br> Andrea...<br> but I really-<br> I see a great deal of myself in you.<br> You can see beyond what people want<br> and what they need...<br> and you can choose for yourself.<br> I don't think I'm like that.<br> L-<br> I couldn't do what you did to Nigel,<br> Miranda.<br> I couldn't do something like that.<br> Mm. You already did.<br> To Emily.<br> That's not what l-<br> No, that was- that was different.<br> I didn't have a choice.<br> Oh, no, you chose<br> You chose to get ahead<br> You want this life,<br> those choices are necessary.<br> But what if this isn't what I want?<br> I mean, what if I don't wanna<br> live the way you live?<br> Don't be ridiculous, Andrea.<br> Everybody wants this.<br> Everybody wants to be us<br> [ Clamoring ]<br> [ Woman Vocalizing ]<br> [ Vocalizing Continues ]<br> [ Cell Phone Ringing ]<br> [ Vocalizing Continues ]<br> I have to be at work in 20 minutes.<br> What's up?<br> Well, I just-<br> I wanted to say<br> that you were right about everything.<br> That...<br> I turned my back on my friends<br> and my family...<br> and everything I believed in...<br> and- and for what?<br> For shoes and shirts<br> and jackets and belts.<br> Nate.<br> I'm sorry.<br> L-<br> [ Clears Throat ]<br> I flew up to Boston while you were gone.<br> I interviewed at the Oak Room.<br> And?<br> And you're looking<br> at their new sous-chef.<br> - I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.<br> - That's great. Congratulations.<br> I don't know what I'm gonna do without<br> those late-night grilled cheeses, but-<br> I'm pretty sure<br> they have bread in Boston.<br> May even haveJarlsberg<br> We might be able<br> to figure something out.<br> You think?<br> Yeah.<br> So, what about you?<br> I mean, what are you gonna do now?<br> Actually, I, uh-<br> I have a job interview today.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> That's what you're wearing?<br> Shut up. I like this.<br> - Andy, Greg Hill.<br> - Hello.<br> Come on. These clips are excellent.<br> This thing on the janitors' union,<br> that's exactly what we do here.<br> My only question is, Runway?<br> My only question is, Runway?<br> You were there for less than a year.<br> What the hell kind of a blip is that?<br> Learned a lot.<br> In the end though,<br> I kind of screwed it up.<br> I called over there for a reference,<br> left word with some snooty girl.<br> Next thing you know, I got a fax<br> from Miranda Priestly herself.<br> Saying that of all the assistants<br> she's ever had...<br> you were, by far,<br> her biggest disappointment.<br> And, if I don't hire you,<br> I am an idiot<br> You must have done something right.<br> - [ Beeping ]<br> - [ Phone Ringing ]<br> Miranda Priestly's office.<br> Hey, Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up.<br> I have a favor to ask you.<br> You have a favor to ask of me?<br> Yeah. The thing is,<br> I have all these clothes from Paris...<br> and I don't have anyplace<br> to wear them...<br> so I was wondering if you<br> could take them off my hands.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> It's a huge imposition.<br> And I'll have to get them taken in.<br> I mean, they'll drown me.<br> But I suppose I could help you out.<br> I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.<br> Thanks, Em. I appreciate it.<br> Good luck.<br> You have some very large shoes to fill.<br> I hope you know that.<br> I don't understand<br> why it is so challenging...<br> to get my car when I ask for it.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Go.<br>
