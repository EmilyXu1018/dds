This is just the same.<br> It's even better.<br> You have to be more clever selling<br> slippers than you do shoes.<br> Don't forget people can always do without slippers.<br> They have to be convinced.<br> How could he tell I'm not a good<br> a salesman as the next one?<br> It's just your vanity that's hurt.<br> And you can sell shoes<br> when you relief for lunch.<br> Show him then what a good salesman you are.<br> Your lunch hour will be from 12:00 to 1:00.<br> That's in 30 minutes.<br> I'm not going to eat lunch.<br> You're not?<br> I'm going to stay here selling slippers.<br> I'm going to make a good impression.<br> Why aren't you going to have lunch?<br> I'm not hungry.<br> I never have lunch anyway.<br> You go to lunch at 12:00 sharp.<br> I uh...No arguments.<br> You don't mind waiting on me do you?<br> What can I do for you madam?<br> Mr Higgins?<br> It's time for lunch.

No<br> Wonderful!<br> Be back in an hour now.<br> The restaurant's two flights up.<br> Aren't you coming?<br> I always bring my own lunch and eat in the park.<br> It's pleasant in there.<br> I don't intend to eat at all.<br> Would it inconvenience you if I sat with you?<br> Not at all. I'd love to have you.<br> Thank you.<br> Kind of stuffy in here.<br> Yes isn't it?<br> Sure you won't have something?<br> No, no thank you very much. I never eat lunch.<br> You men worry more about<br> your figures than women do.<br> It's not my figure I worry about.<br> It's uh...I'm just not hungry.<br> Isn't it terrible about the store<br> not letting people organize?<br> I made these myself.<br> It's very rude of you not to try one.<br> I wonder where they are<br> holding a meeting tonight?<br> Go on, eat it.<br> What is it?<br> Tunafish popover.<br> Tunafish popover?<br> My own invention.<br> Bite it.<br> On no, I couldn't really, I couldn't.<br> Oh please.<br> If I asked you too?<br> You haven't got a graham cracker have you?<br> Oh a grown man eating graham crackers.<br> Why there's no nurishment in that.<br> You eat that popover.<br> It won't bite you.<br> Won't it though?<br> Tunafish.<br> Like it?<br> I don't know yet.<br> Is it good tunafish?<br> Costs 12 cents a tin.<br> It's almost as good as you can buy.<br> Almost!<br> Go on, eat it.<br> Tastes good.<br> Thank you<br> Here, have another.<br> No no, thank you just the same.<br> Oh, one isn't enough to feed an infant.<br> Go on, take it.<br> How does a man exist without<br> a woman looking after him?<br> I could tell you were a single man.<br> You are single aren't you?<br> Yes, I am.<br> What did you do before this?<br> What kind of work?<br> Oh all kinds. You'd be surprised.<br> Were you out of work long<br> before you got this job?<br> Hmm. Yes.<br> How long were you employed at your last place?<br> Fifteen years.<br> And how long before that?<br> Ten years.<br> Isn't that awful.<br> Mr. Hooper's coming.<br> Hello, Mr. Hooper.<br> Good afternoon, Mr. Hooper.<br> How do you do Miss Ellis?<br> You usually sits here for a few minutes.<br> Oh. I hope that he's not angry.<br> Another popover!<br> Fire the section manager!<br> You know he ate almost all my lunch.<br> He was famished!<br> I gave him 50 cents.<br> He probably needed it so badly he<br> didn't want to spend it for lunch.<br> Oh dear.<br> Don't look up. A shopper is coming.<br> What?<br> A store shopper, they pretend they're customers.<br> But they're only testing you.<br> Be careful how you act.<br> Oh uh, may I help you madam?<br> Oh that's alright,<br> this gentleman will wait on me.<br> Yes, maam.<br> What can I do for you madam?<br> Do you sell slippers here?<br> Yes maam, we do.<br> These are slippers.<br> That's what we call them slippers.<br> They don't look very good. Oh but they are.<br> I wear a pair of these myself.<br> Woolies. Keep your feet nice and warm.<br> Real sheep wool.<br> Aren't they a little too warm for summer?<br> We never had any complaint<br> from the sheep. Haha.<br> I'll think about it. I hope you didn't mind<br> my inconvenicing you without buying anything.<br> Of course not madam.<br> I'm only here to serve you.<br> Are you chewing gum?<br> No maam.<br> I'm a store shopper.<br> Open your mouth.<br> Did you swallow that gum?<br> No maam, I wasn't chewing any gum.<br> Well, see that you don't in the future.<br> And don't lean on the counter.<br> Yes, maam.<br> Shoppers out.<br> Well you didn't do so badly.<br> Say! What are you doing? Keeping a diary?<br> It's kind of a diary.<br> A doomsday book.<br> What's a doomsday book?<br> A doomsday book contains the names of a lot of<br> people who are going to meet their doom.<br> I don't get it.<br> Employees! Listen employees!<br> Here I am! Right here!<br> Gather round please!<br> All the employees of the Neeleys Department Store.<br> I have a message for you.<br> They have fired some of us for organizing.<br> But we haven't given up!<br> We are still at it!<br> Call the detectives!<br> Call the detectives!<br> Don't be afraid!<br> Come to our meeting!<br> If enough of us stick together<br> they won't be able to stop it!<br> Nobody listen to him!<br> Everybody stop him!<br> I repeat, come to our meeting!<br> Get him out!<br> Get him out of here.<br> This is one time you can't throw me out gentlemen.<br> And I haven't any key.<br> Take him away!<br> Saw me out!<br> It will only take about four hours.<br> And while you're sawing I'll give a little speech.<br> Don't be afraid! Come to our meeting!<br> In union there is strength!<br> We have to fight together.<br> We have to think...Hey!<br> Right is on our side.<br> And don't be afraid.<br> We got the situation well in hand.<br> They can't stop us now!<br> I tell you they can't...<br> Fellow employees.<br> And I call you fellow employees...<br> because that is what we all are...<br> from the lowly stock clerk to me myself,<br> though, I carry the title of general manager.<br> There was a disturbance on the 5th floor today.<br> A shocking unamerican invasion of private property.<br> Nothing more or less than trespassing.<br> A criminal offense.<br> There are still some troublemakers<br> employed in this store...<br> ...we have not as yet burried it out. But we shall.<br> And if employees will come<br> cooperating with these traitors...<br> ...in our one big happy family<br> I can tell you now<br> they will be not only discharged.<br> but blackballed from working in any<br> department store in this city.<br> Now, may I wish you all a very good evening.<br> Good night, fellow employees.<br> Are you doing anything tonight?<br> Eh? No. Not especially.<br> Come with me.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> What've you got in there?<br> Me, you idiot!<br> Don't get excited pop,<br> I thought it was a package.<br> Come on, Come on.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Does it hurt much?<br> A little.<br> I can't understand how you<br> never have eaten in an automat before.<br> I never thought of it.<br> I could sue them getting my<br> finger caught like that.<br> Well, I don't know. I've been eating<br> there for years and I haven't heard of<br> anybody getting his fingers caught before.<br> Say, tell me the truth.<br> Was the manager right?<br> Did you try to get that blueberry pie<br> out without putting in a nickel?<br> You too?<br> I tell you, I did put in a nickel.<br> But I went to get coffee and somebody<br> must have sneaked the pie out.<br> It was their responsibility to<br> get me another piece of pie.<br> And I'd have gotten it too<br> if you hadn't interferred.<br> Honey! Joe, did they do anything<br> to you? Did they hurt you?<br> Never laid a hand on me.<br> I dared them too.<br> I was so afraid that they'd do something to you.<br> Well, uh, who's this?<br> He started in the store this morning.<br> Oh welcome brother!<br> Mr Higgins, this is Joe O'Brien.<br> He hung up the dummy of John P. Merrick.<br> Made the frontpage of the Times, that's all.<br> Did you see him?<br> Yes, I saw it. This is quite a pleasure.<br> Likewise. Come on.<br> We're just about ready to start.<br> Come on.<br> I knew you'd join us.<br> I could tell that from the minute I saw you.<br> Alright everybody...<br> I uh...see that some of you<br> are here for the 1st time.<br> and you'd probably like to know more about us.<br> We are not professional agitators.<br> I myself started six years<br> ago at the Neely store<br> as a packing boy<br> and worked up to assistant section manager.<br> Now, our quarrel is simple.<br> We're given a small raise every year.<br> Thanks.<br> At the end of 10 or 15 years when our<br> salary is higher than a new employs<br> we're let out<br> Now this is a regular practice<br> at the store mind you.<br> Probably good bookkeeping...<br> But, I think that it's pretty unfair.<br> We're entitled to some security in exchange...<br> ...for a quarter of a lifetime of loyalty<br> to one employer.<br> Um, may I interrupt please?<br> I've attended many of these meetings<br> but I've never spoken before.<br> I'd like to show you a practical case<br> of what we're fighting for if I may.<br> Certainly, Mary.<br> Step up here.<br> This is Miss Jones of childrens shoes.<br> (Applause)<br> Mr Higgins, would you step up here please?<br> Mr. Higgins!<br> Mr. Higgins!<br> Step up here, will you please?<br> This is Thomas Higgins.<br> How old are you Mr. Higgins.<br> Fifty five.<br> Now don't be nervious, Tom.<br> He's 55. Now that's not so very old.<br> Look at him, he's bright,<br> alert, has all his faculties...<br> ...Can you honestly expect to be<br> in better condition at his age?<br> I hardly think so.<br> This then is the picture<br> of you...and me...<br> at 55 years of age.<br> Now I'm going to tell you<br> the rest of that picture.<br> He came to work this morning<br> in childrens shoes...<br> without the few cents in his<br> pocket he needed to buy lunch.<br> And that isn't all.<br> I gave him 50 cents.<br> Do you know what he did with it?<br> He kept it because he needed<br> even that 50 cents...<br> ...more than he needed food.<br> Maybe for medicine.<br> Maybe for a place to sleep tonight,<br> I don't know. I didn't ask him<br> I felt too ashamed for him.<br> Do you want to know how he got his lunch?<br> From another employee.<br> Sharing the few crusts she brought<br> which were hardly enough for herself.<br> Fifty five years old...<br> ...and nothing to eat.<br> By what kind fate did he<br> get a job today I'll never know.<br> And how long will the store keep him?<br> And what will become of him<br> when they let him out?<br> And he will be let out, he has been before.<br> He worked 15 years. 15 long<br> loyal years and they let him go.<br> Before that, he had a job for 10 years.<br> Twenty five years for only two employers.<br> Surely this man must have<br> been capable of holding a job.<br> And yet, now.<br> White haired...<br> Friendless...<br> He faces another employer.<br> Who will use him.<br> and when he's through with him,<br> he'll throw him aside...<br> ...for a younger man.<br> Leaving him insecure, friendless, homeless...<br> with noone to turn to except<br> charity and the poorhouse.<br> Please, take your seat.<br> You were wonderful.<br> I didn't do anything.<br> Alright everybody.<br> If you don't think that we're right<br> now nothing will ever convince you.<br> Are you with us or aren't you?<br> We sure are Joe.<br> We're with you Joe.<br> What do you think their complaint is?<br> They are getting too much money.<br> That's what it is actually.<br> I knew they were crackpots.<br> Why don't they make themselves so<br> indispensible the store can't fire them?<br> Oh no. That's too hard. Heh<br> I'm glad I saw this.<br> I found out who some of them are.<br> The first day too.<br> Not all of them, just give<br> me another couple of days.<br> Heh. The idiots.<br> Making me one of them.<br> I'll show them who hangs who.<br> Shall I crumple them, sir?<br> Graham crackers, take it away.<br> And let me tell you another thing...<br> If I'm not sick by tonight or<br> tomorrow at the latest<br> my fancy Doctor Schindler from Vienna,<br> will wish he was back in Vienna.<br> Yes, sir.<br> And I want a lunch prepared for<br> me tomorrow to take along.<br> In a shoe box.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I want tunafish popovers.<br> Tunafish popovers?!<br> Tunafish popovers?<br> You heard me.<br> I wonder, I wonder if the chef<br> can make tunafish popovers?<br> Then get one who does.<br> If certain people can make<br> them on a little gas stove...<br> then that idiot downstairs ought to be<br> able to make them in that whole restaurant.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I didn't do so well selling<br> things today.<br> It's just a matter of luck.<br> Yes sir.<br> What I want you to do...<br> is to get a little girl...<br> ...and bring her to the shoe department<br> tomorrow at exactly ten after twelve.<br> Is there anything<br> I can do for you sir?<br> I thought, I thought I would buy<br> some shoes for my little girl.<br> Shoes for the little girl, yes sir.<br> Certainly sir.<br> Won't you be seated.<br> Yes sir. I mean certainly.<br> He'll bungle it.<br> No, he's pretty good Mr. Hooper.<br> I've been watching him. (Snort)<br> I want you to buy a dozen pair of shoes.<br> Eleven? I think that's too many.<br> They'll get suspicious.<br> You think so?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Alright, then a half dozen.<br> No less.<br> No, sir, half-a-dozen.<br> One and a half.<br> Thank you.<br> This is your chance.<br> Now don't be nervious.<br> I'm not nervious. Stop talking about it.<br> What size do you want?<br> One and a half.<br> Here. Now don't be nervious.<br> For heavens sake.<br> Is this the hardest shoe to sell?<br> What's the hardest shoe to<br> get rid of in the whole stock?<br> The hardest?<br> Yes.<br> Well, we have some hightops that<br> haven't moved for years.<br> Fine. These are the ones I want.<br> Don't you think that you'd better start on these?<br> How many of those do you got in stock?<br> Five.<br> That's too bad. I could sell six.<br> I wish that you'd try to sell the ordinary shoes,<br> you're making trouble for yourself.<br> Now. Here we are.<br> Just slip your foot in.<br> I don't like that.<br> Come come now.<br> Put your foot in the shoe Sally.<br> I don't want to, I don't like it.<br> Put your foot in.<br> I don't like it!<br> Where'd you get this brat?<br> She belongs to the upstairs maid.<br> If she doesn't stop squirming there's<br> going to be another upstairs maid.<br> Stop squirming dear.<br> I don't like it! I don't like it!<br> No! No! No!<br> I knew he didn't have the<br> personality for shoes.<br> Stop squirming dear.<br> I don't like it! I don't like it!<br> No, no, no...<br> I don't like it!<br> Grab hold of her, grab hold of her.<br> Well, well, well.<br> How are we coming along?<br> Fine!<br> Mr. Higgins.<br> We're not shoeing a horse you know?<br> Look. Look what I've<br> got for the little lady.<br> You're quite sure that<br> you want this type of shoe?<br> Yes, sir. This is the type that I want.<br> Hmm. All five pairs.<br> I've been looking for this model.<br> They are very hard to find.<br> (Nudges Higgins) There's someone at your<br> slipper counter. I'll take care of this customer.<br> I've got these shoes sold.<br> There's someone at your slipper counter.<br> He's not a regular shoe salesman.<br> I'm the section manager but<br> I'm going to wait on you myself.<br> Thank you.<br> There's someone at your slipper counter.<br> Will you take them with you sir<br> or shall I send them?<br> Are you taking these shoes sir?<br> Yes, sir. Wrap them up please.<br> (Higgins waves)<br> (Higgins falls)<br> Now young lady, your own shoe.<br> Fire Section Manager!<br> Don't you feel badly<br> He'll get his just desserts<br> one of these days.<br> I'd like to be as certain<br> of the hereafter Miss Jones.<br> And don't lose confidence in yourself.<br> You could've sold them just as well.<br> He only brought it in cause<br> he wanted to get the bonus.<br> I don't remember when I've ever<br> disliked anyone as hardily as I do him.<br> And I've disliked quite a<br> few people in my time...<br> ...to their misfortune.<br> You just forget all about it.<br> I'm an elephant, Miss Jones.<br> A veritable elephant.<br> I never forget a good deed<br> done to me or an ill one.<br> I consider myself sort of a divine justice.<br> Other people in this world<br> have to forget things.<br> I do not.<br> Now don't talk like you're out of your mind.<br> And don't be blasfemous about divine justice.<br> I don't like that.<br> I came over here to ask you<br> something very important.<br> What is it?<br> Well, Elizabeth asked me to ask you...<br> if you'd like to take her to Coney Island<br> tomorrow with Joe and me.<br> Oh, it's Dutch treat.<br> And you have to let her know right away because...<br> ...well Mr. Hopper's asked her out.<br> Has he ever taken her out before?<br> Oh. Lots of times.<br> Does she like him?<br> Well uh....<br> You know how it is, a girl has<br> to go out with someone.<br> He keeps asking her and asking her.<br> Oh, I'd like to go, certainly.<br> I'll tell her.<br> Um, there's something else.<br> Now I don't want you to say anything to<br> Mr. Hopper about the sale he took away from you.<br> There's no use antagonizing him, cause,<br> afterall he can let you out.<br> He can, eh?<br> Now promise me that you won't say anything.<br> Promise me.<br> Oh, alright. I won't say anything.<br> Do you know what would be very clever?<br> If you go over and thank him for helping you out.<br> Thank him?<br> You want to keep this job don't you?<br> You're in no position to be indepedent.<br> Go on over. Go on.<br> Go on.<br> Mr. Hopper.<br> Mr. Hopper.<br> Yes?<br> Well, uh. I wanted to say about that sale.<br> You've got quite a way with children.<br> They certainly take to you, like a duck to water.<br> Hot water.<br> Well I probably couldn't have<br> handled it as well as you...<br> As well as me? You couldn't handle it at all.<br> I made that sale.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I have a hunch those shoes are coming back.<br> My sales never come back.<br> Want to bet?<br> Certainly. How much?<br> Make it easy on yourself.<br> How much can you afford?<br> Oh. I can manage to scrap something together.<br> Would ten dollars be too much?<br> Make it twenty?<br> I'd be lucky if I get the ten.<br> I'll say so.<br> If you want to bet anymore...<br> I'll give you odds.<br> Ten dollars.<br> Just get back to your slipper counter.<br> What do you think I was wig-wagging at you for?<br> Playing Boy Scout?<br> I didn't understand, sir.<br> I keep indicating for you not to buy anything..<br> That was simple enough.<br> But you had given me such definite<br> instructions to buy the shoes sir.<br> I...<br> Kind of a picnic tomorrow.<br> Everybodys bringing something.<br> I said I'd bring a bottle of wine.<br> They don't think I will<br> because I haven't the money. Haha<br> Well, to the wine cellar.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I haven't been down here in 15 years.<br> No sir, you bought most of these before prohibition.<br> What's the best bottle of wine in the whole place.<br> Best? I would say this is, sir.<br> Romane-Conti 1903.<br> It's good, eh?<br> There were only 24 bottles in the world orginally.<br> You bought 12 and the royal<br> family have the other 12.<br> Take the label off the bottle.<br> I don't want them to be suspicious.<br> Label off the bottle?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Very interesting George, my little experiment.<br> I'm glad that you are enjoying yourself, sir.<br> I watch the little ants scurry around and I know<br> each and every one is going to get his just desserts.<br> I am sure they are.<br> That Joe, Mary's fellow...<br> Bad. An evil influence on the girl.<br> Kind of Svengali corrupting her whole viewpoint.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'm going to break that up tomorrow.<br> I'll talk her out of that.<br> And then there's Hopper.<br> A petty tyrant.<br> Well, he's going to get his reward.<br> Then there's Elizabeth...<br> Well, come on, up with you.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Oh dear, I knew that I forgot<br> something, the pickles.<br> Hey! You little guttersnipe!<br> Why don't you look where you're going.<br> Do you understand Italian?<br> I understand that. Hehe.<br> Say, would it be too much to ask<br> you two millionaires to lend a hand here?<br> Women's place in the world is to tend the male.<br> Not this woman and not this male.<br> Here, open it.<br> Why don't we try my wine?<br> Well, I've never been interested in domestic wine.<br> This isn't exactly domestic.<br> Oh Tom, you shouldn't have<br> spent your money for this.<br> Oh well. You only live once.<br> Skol!<br> But I don't know what it means.<br> Hehe.<br> Well?<br> You like it don't you?<br> Yeah, well I tell you Tom,<br> it's not really bad it's...<br> Tom, did you spend more than 50 cents for this?<br> Oh Tom, they saw you coming.<br> Who saw you coming?<br> You mean that you don't like this wine?<br> Say, I have a good mind to return it<br> and make them give you your money back.<br> Yeah. Oh the nerve of some people.<br> Gee wiz.<br> Now wait a minute.<br> You're not giving this wine a fair chance.<br> Hey, I got an idea. Just a second.<br> Here...<br> We'll open this and put some<br> of this in it. See?<br> Put some of this in.<br> No, come on, it'll help kill the taste.<br> Well, skol again.<br> No.<br> It's no use.<br> No. I guess that you can't save it.<br> It's a shame really.<br> Too bad we had to ruin a bottle of pop.<br> Isn't it?<br> Pour it out, Tom. It might make you sick.<br> I am sick.<br> Wine experts!<br> Now here's a bottle of wine,<br> that's really a bottle of wine.<br> This was made by our iceman's grandfather.<br> Same as he used to do in the old country.<br> He puts the grapes in the<br> bathtub and he jumps on them. Haha<br> I saw him do it.<br> Ah! Real jumped on grapes, huh?<br> Why didn't he take his socks off?<br> I knew you'd like it.<br> Well, I'm going for a swim.<br> See you all in a minute.<br> Haha!<br> Ah!<br> Now don't show off and swim way out!<br> We'll be watching you.<br> Say, maybe the pragperry man will have<br> some extra pickles he'll sell. I'll be back in a minute.<br> Don't worry.<br> Nothing will happen to him.<br> Ah. He's a pretty good swimmer.<br> He's pretty good at everything.<br> You wouldn't be prejudice.<br> Maybe.<br> Is it possible that you're reading<br> virtues into him that don't exist?<br> Don't you like him?<br> What makes you say that?<br> Well, I was watching you on the subway and<br> thought that you were making faces at him.<br> My feet were hurting me.<br> But you're not really crazy about him.<br> Well...That depends upon how<br> much you're in love with thim.<br> And I don't think that you're any judge.<br> Who's a better one?<br> Any outsider.<br> Me, for instance.<br> Now look around us.<br> There's a couple over there.<br> They think that they were made for each other.<br> He's bitting her ear.<br> Now, she's bitting his ear.<br> Very touching.<br> I think so.<br> They've found each other, haven't they?<br> Out of this whole wide world,<br> these two were lucky enough to come together.<br> But, don't you think. If she hadn't meet him<br> there'd be someone else bitting her ear right now?<br> And don't you think he'd be at some<br> other girl's ear? Probably ten feet away?<br> Maybe.<br> But that doesn't prove anything.<br> Scientists can write all the books<br> they like love being a trap of nature.<br> I remember reading that.<br> That it's biology and chemistry<br> inside a woman that fools her.<br> But all the scientists are going to<br> convince are other scientists, not women in love.<br> I don't say Joe is the greatest<br> thing that ever lived.<br> I probably wouldn't love him if he was...<br> ...I'd just want to look at him.<br> But you she I'm not the greatest<br> girl in the world either.<br> Two people look at each other...<br> ...and they see something way deep inside.<br> That nobody else can.<br> And that's it.<br> I wouldn't be surprised if the greatest love affair<br> in the world was between a chinamen wearing a pigtail<br> and a girl who's missing two front teeth<br> If you could measure it.<br> If they feel it, they feel it.<br> Do you?<br> Not the way you see in the movies.<br> Or hear in those songs, you know...<br> ...about the touch of your<br> hand you set me on fire.<br> I guess that I'm not the combustible type.<br> But, when I'm with him...<br> I don't know if it's the<br> advertised 7th heaven.<br> We get along just average I guess.<br> Little arguing...<br> ...Even maybe being a little<br> bored if we admit it.<br> But, yet if I knew that<br> I'd never see him again...<br> Yes?<br> I've never even thought of<br> what it would be like...<br> ...not to see him anymore.<br> I guess that's the test of it.<br> If I thought...<br> ...that I'd never see him again...<br> ...I don't think I'd care if I lived or died.<br> Look! I found some pretzels.<br> They're homemade.<br> The pragperryman's wife makes them.<br> From her own recipe. Don't they look delicious?<br> Gangway!<br> Oh boy! Pretzels!<br> Oh, Joe! No!<br> Don't you dare! You'll spoil your lunch!<br> Joe! No!<br> Joe! Spit it out!<br> Spit it out, Joe!<br> I beg your pardon.<br> I was wondering if I could find out whether my<br> clothes are in this bathhouse?<br> Did you take them off in here?<br> Well, I don't exactly remember.<br> Where's your locker key?<br> That's got our name on it.<br> I shared the locker with a young<br> friend of mine, he has the key.<br> But unfortunately I can't find him or<br> any of the people that I came with.<br> I've been walking about for hours.<br> Does this look like the place?<br> I rented this suit.<br> Can you tell me if it's yours?<br> Not ours.<br> That's a pretty cheap suit.<br> Not yours.<br> Thank you.<br> Ain't ours.<br> Thanks.<br> It don't belong to us.<br> How many bathhouses are there around here?<br> A couple of hundred.<br> A couple of hundred...<br> Thanks.<br> Young man.<br> Yes, sir?<br> I've got a big bargain for you.<br> How would you like to give me<br> a dollar or two for this gold watch?<br> You mean, uh, you want to leave it for security?<br> No, I don't think that I'll be down here again.<br> I'll let you have it for a dollar.<br> A dollar?<br> That's all. It's a very fine watch.<br> Solid gold. Here take a look at it.<br> Yes...Hmm...hmm<br> Uh, would you mind if I showed this<br> to the boss? I'll only be a second.<br> I only want a dollar for it.<br> This is a pretty good watch for a dollar, Pop.<br> You got anymore?<br> For heaven sake!<br> No need to get excited. There's been a lot<br> of stuff stolen from lockers around here.<br> and we're just checking up.<br> Well I assure you that watch is not stolen.<br> It's an awful good watch to go for a buck.<br> Officer, I've lost the friends I came with...<br> ...I can't find my bathhouse...<br> ...and I've been walking around for hours<br> trying to trace this rented suit.<br> I want to sell the watch so I can telephone<br> my home and have my car and chauffeur come for me.<br> Oh you have a car and chauffeur?<br> Yes, I have.<br> And you rent a bathing suit.<br> Where did you get this watch?<br> Well if you want to know, the governor<br> gave it to me on my birthday.<br> The Governor?<br> My boss works for him.<br> Now what do you say we go down and pay him a visit.<br> You know kind of friendly-like. You let go my arm!<br> Now be a good boy, pop. Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Take your hand off of me.<br> ...Pretty monotonous. Listen. I'm getting good<br> and sick of seeing your ugly little face.<br> You're not even a good pickpocket.<br> When are you going to get sense enough to quit?<br> Take him away. Marv.<br> Yes, sir. Come on.<br> He was trying to sell this watch<br> to a clerk in a drugstore for a dollar.<br> When I questioned him about it, he said he wanted<br> the money to call his chauffeur.<br> And beside that he told me that he got<br> the watch from the governor.<br> I thought that sounded suspicious.<br> Suspicious enough for me...<br> I would advise you two simple guardians of law and order...<br> ...for the sake of your own future security...<br> ...to be very careful of any<br> decision you make concerning me.<br> How was that again?<br> Tom!<br> Tom, we've been looking everywhere for you!<br> Joe's running up and down the boardwalk<br> and Elizabeth's gone to the hospital.<br> What happened to you?<br> I got lost.<br> My!<br> Well thank heaven you're all in one piece.<br> Thanks for finding him officer.<br> That's alright miss.<br> You can call your chauffeur from here.<br> Here.<br> What chauffeur?<br> What chauffeur?<br> The chauffeur that you were going to call.<br> Me?<br> Certainly you.<br> I haven't got any chauffeur.<br> Wasn't he trying to get money<br> to call his chauffeur?<br> That's what he told me.<br> Say! What's going on here?<br> I don't know what he's talking about.<br> Oh you must be mistaking him for somebody else.<br> Say, what do you two do for a living?<br> We work, of course.<br> Where?<br> Don't list the store. We'll get fired.<br> Hey, stop that!<br> Where do you work?<br> At the automat.<br> What do you do?<br> I have charge of blueberry pies.<br> I put them in those little boxes.<br> And what do you do?<br> I uh...I help him.<br> I snap the boxes shut.<br> There's something fishy going on here.<br> My feet hurt.<br> Can't we continue this while we're seated?<br> You know, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.<br> Supposing someone treated your father like this?<br> Is he your father?<br> Yes.<br> Girlie, I catch you in more lies<br> than you can shake a stick at.<br> If he's your father, why did you call<br> him Tom when you came in here?<br> I always call Tom. My goodness.<br> Is there a law against calling your own<br> father by his first name?<br> Come with me miss.<br> Where were you born?<br> In New York.<br> Shhh, keep your voice down.<br> What street?<br> Uh, 121st street.<br> What street was she born on?<br> Look at me!<br> They're the ones that have been selling<br> this hot stuff alright. I'll bet on it.<br> How much do you want to bet?<br> Mary! Where did you disappear to...<br> I got lost, and I couldn't find...<br> Quiet, everybody, quiet.<br> I'm telling you two that anything you say<br> may be used against you.<br> So, uh, use your own judgement.<br> What happened?<br> Joe, you better go home.<br> We'll met you later.<br> Quiet you!<br> How well do you know these two?<br> Well, I know them well enough to<br> know that they haven't done anything.<br> Where do they work?<br> Uh...Mary stop that!<br> Come on!<br> Neeley Department Store.<br> Ah-haa!<br> Ah-haa! Some detective!<br> Are they, uh, father and daughter?<br> Uh...yes...no!<br> What are you...<br> Joe, please don't say anything more.<br> I don't want to tell you to<br> keep quiet again, girlie.<br> How about using a more civil tone officer?<br> Who, me?<br> Yes, you.<br> Have they charged you with anything?<br> No.<br> Then you don't have to stay here.<br> Come on out.<br> Hey, stay right here!<br> Look you can't hold people here unless you've<br> got a charge preferred against them!<br> I can fix that.<br> Was he dressed like that in the drugstore?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Violating a city ordinance, wearing a<br> bathing suit on the boardwalk.<br> How do you like that for a charge.<br> There were many other people wearing bathing suits.<br> Well, are you satisfied, or would<br> you like to see another charge?<br> You just try it.<br> Really?<br> Say...<br> Did he come along peaceful or did he pull on your arm?<br> He made quite a protest.<br> He did, eh?<br> Resisting an officer.<br> Would you like to see another charge?<br> I'd like it fine!<br> Say!<br> Trespassing.<br> Suits me.<br> Soliciting funds.<br> Keep on.<br> Peddling without a license.<br> Haha, you're not frightening me.<br> Stop!<br> He's frightening me.<br> And we'll throw in a little case of vagrancy<br> How does that suit you?<br> That's just dandy.<br> A vagrant. Me?<br> We haven't even started on you, yet.<br> Young man, what do you think that you're accomplishing?<br> Tom, I'm giving him enough rope to hang himself.<br> You're giving me enough rope.<br> I've got a little surprise for you.<br> I'm charging you with obstructing justice.<br> Fine.<br> And contempt of police authority.<br> Fine.<br> And suspicion to start a group to riot.<br> Fine!<br> What's the matter?<br> Your imagination running out of charges?<br> Are you an idiot?<br> Who do you think this man is?<br> This man is a servant of the people that's all.<br> And a darn poor one at that.<br> I don't work for him,<br> he works for me.<br> How do you like that?<br> Let him put me in jail. I'll holler my head off.<br> This is a free country.<br> You let a guy say you were spitting on<br> the sidewalk when you weren't...<br> ...and the next thing he'll do is<br> tear up the Constitution<br> Say are you crazy?<br> Yes, I'm a little crazy.<br> But that happens to me my<br> particular kind of patriotism<br> I don't care how small the right is<br> you're trying to take away from me...<br> ...I'll fight for it.<br> The Boston Tea Party was<br> started over one penny.<br> This is big enough for me.<br> Well? Put me in jail.<br> Don't tell me what to do.<br> I'm running this place.<br> Go on! Lock me up!<br> You've got enough charges.<br> I'll lock you up when I'm good and ready.<br> Ok, take your time.<br> We, the People of the United States,<br> In order to form a more perfect union,<br> establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility,<br> provide for the common defense, promote...<br> Don't look so startled sargeant, in<br> case you didn't recognize it that's<br> the beginning of our Constitution.<br> I'll recite it for you.<br> Where was I? Oh, yes...<br> Provide for the common defense...<br> There he is. If he thinks he's<br> right he won't give into anybody.<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> Not very pratical.<br> No, he isn't. But he's wonderful!<br> I also know some of the Declaration of Independence.<br> I might get a couple of the words wrong,<br> but you'll get the general idea.<br> When, in the course of human events,<br> it becomes necessary to...<br> I don't like this.<br> Neither do I.<br> When they start reciting the Constitution.<br> Look out.<br> We had a nut like this downtown once.<br> Twas was awful.<br> What can one fellow like him do?<br> It's not him, but it gets in the papers.<br> That somebody sends down a big lawyer,<br> then you ought to see what happens in court.<br> You'd be thinking it was a big murder trial<br> What? For a little thing like this?<br> The way they mix it up?<br> Turns out that Abraham Lincoln's on trial.<br> Lincoln?<br> Trial downtown took over two weeks.<br> Two weeks?<br> My vacation starts Wednesday.<br> Oh, but you'll spend it listening to Abraham Lincoln.<br> In a nice hot courtroom.<br> My wife would skin me alive.<br> One of those reporters will be here any<br> minute now. You know what'll happen then.<br> Yeah...<br> Quiet!<br> A lucky thing for you that<br> I feel charitable today.<br> We're going to suspend charges<br> on both of you. You can go on.<br> Oh no you don't...wait a minute!<br> You're not going to get off that easy!<br> I'm not going to get off?<br> We don't want any suspended charges<br> hanging over our heads.<br> What do you want? Maybe you'd like an apology?<br> Well what's wrong with that?<br> You've humillated this man. You dragged him<br> in barefooted, questioned him like a criminal<br> And you think that an apology's too much?<br> Boys! Throw him out!<br> I'm not going to move one step until those<br> charges are not suspended, but dropped.<br> Alright, they're dropped.<br> And I apologize.<br> Now get out of here!<br> I didn't that you'd have the grace to apologize.<br> Even in that tone it's appreciated.<br> And stay out of this precint<br> or I'll have you arrested.<br> Gone on about your business.<br> Next time you bring a thing like that in here<br> I'll throw you right into the ocean.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I mean no sir.<br> Lincoln!<br> Say, we'd better get you dressed.<br> You two try to cool off on the sand.<br> Joe!<br> What's that for?<br> Because you're wonderful.<br> Some wonderful.<br> Come on.<br> It's getting pretty late.<br> Better wake him up and go home.<br> Oh, let's let them sleep a while longer.<br> They must be awfully tired.<br> You know, he didn't like you very much?<br> But I think that he changed his opinion<br> in the police station. I was watching him.<br> Whether that old goat likes me or not it<br> certainly doesn't change my life.<br> Did you watch what he's been eating?<br> He acts like a guy that<br> just discovered his stomach.<br> I don't think a goat could<br> put that stuff away.<br> You know, you're making him a responsibility.<br> I want him to marry Elizabeth.<br> Oh...<br> Why shouldn't they get married?<br> Well, why should they?<br> Because she loves him.<br> How do you know?<br> I can tell.<br> It'd be wonderful for him.<br> And he must be very lonely.<br> You know it doesn't make any difference<br> how many people you talk to during the day<br> If you haven't got someone that<br> really cares for you...<br> ...you're all alone.<br> You're one person against the world...<br> ...unless you have someone.<br> Then it's only half as hard.<br> At least you're two against the world.<br> So you both starve, instead of<br> starving alone.<br> Joe, don't let yourself get depressed.<br> It's all over, Mary.<br> We've lost.<br> What do you mean, we've lost?<br> How can you blame them?<br> Black list, store detectives.<br> I don't see how we got the 400.<br> Maybe if you gave it more time Joe.<br> Time? We had a year already.<br> So we have a 100 more, they'd<br> walk out like sheep to the slaughter..<br> People like this, who starve quietly<br> wishing that they hadn't joined.<br> Oh it's doomed Mary, I know it.<br> I got the poor suckers into working<br> at least keep their jobs<br> Joe, if only you could reach all of them.<br> Yeah, if, if, sure.<br> If the store would only ask them to<br> go out to Bryant Park for me to speak to them.<br> Mary, I want to talk to you.<br> I meant to do it when I brought you home,<br> but, now's as good a time as any.<br> I can't get a job in New York.<br> Mary, I...I can't see you anymore.<br> For awhile.<br> What do you mean?<br> Well, I...I can't.<br> I can't take up your time.<br> Is that what you call our relationship?<br> Taking up my time?<br> I haven't got the right to take up your time,<br> that's what I'm trying to tell you.<br> Well, I think that you ought to<br> ask my opinion about that.<br> What are your plans Joe?<br> What do you want to do? Go out of town?<br> I'll go with you, that's not<br> such a terrible thing to ask.<br> Oh, Mary you'd...<br> Oh, I'd love to if you want me.<br> I wish that you'd marry me,<br> just like it is.<br> I'm not afraid.<br> Marriage?<br> You're not afraid.<br> Women are never afraid.<br> How do you think that you'd be in love<br> with me living off your salary?<br> That's nothing to be ashamed<br> of, if you can't help it.<br> Not to you, but it is to me.<br> I bought me a $5 walet for my<br> birthday and left the sales slip<br> in so I could trade it in for the money.<br> Oh, who are we fooling?<br> The next guy won't be giving me the money.<br> Quarter at a time, no lodge for carfare,<br> for cigarettes...<br> ...I can't be in love under<br> those conditions.<br> I don't want to marry you.<br> Honey, I...<br> I shouldn't have done that.<br> I didn't have any right to ask you to marry me.<br> I don't own you, you know,<br> even though I act like it.<br> We've got to look at it sensibly.<br> Maybe, it'll still turn out alright, in someway.<br> But, I couldn't go away<br> obligating you to wait for me.<br> That's very considerate of you, at least.<br> Maybe, I hope that you'll wait for me.<br> But, you're young and attractive,<br> you got a whole life ahead of you.<br> Go out and meet people, have a good time.<br> It's certainly coming to you.<br> Who knows? You might get<br> interested in somebody wonderful.<br> Yeah. That's what somebody was<br> telling me reciently.<br> That's what nature does, is let you<br> get interested in other people.<br> It's uh...A kind of protection.<br> Well...<br> Then I don't promise to wait for<br> you, if that'll make you happy.<br> What do you intend to do, Joe?<br> Uh, why the government's taking<br> young fellow for construction work.<br> Down in Panama.<br> I'd have a trade by the time I got back.<br> You'd only have to stay a little while.<br> Two or three years I think.<br> Two or three years?<br> Why, I...I thought you meant you'd<br> only be gone a few months.<br> Why, you're nothing but a coward.<br> That's what you are.<br> For all your bravery in police stations<br> you can't even face life.<br> Half the world's starving to death,<br> and you're afraid to get married<br> because you might not be able to get a job.<br> It's not me I'm worrying about.<br> I'm not going to get locked up in<br> a home bedroom watching you iron my shirts...<br> ...and nobodys going to make me.<br> Nobody's going to make you do anything.<br> Go on to Panama, go to any place you like...<br> Oh Mary now...<br> Right now you can go on home.<br> Go on, unless you're afraid of the dark.<br> Better keep it.<br> It's going to turn out alright.<br> I've got a seventh sense.<br> You mean a sixth sense.<br> I mean a seventh sense.<br> I've got a sixth sense and a seventh sense.<br> It's going to turn out alright.<br> You really shouldn't drink.<br> It isn't good for you.<br> Three glasses of beer. You can't get drunk on that.<br> You are.<br> Oh...<br> Elizabeth,<br> Yes, Tom?<br> I want you to tell me something.<br> What is it?<br> Didn't Hooper ask you out today?<br> Yes, he did.<br> Well, tell me, why did you go with me instead?<br> You really want to know?<br> Certainly.<br> You won't laugh at me?<br> Of course not.<br> Well, Mr. Hooper is the...<br> Well, he's the executive type...<br> ...and you're sort of helpless<br> and someone to look after you.<br> He's the executive and I'm...<br> Now, don't be offended.<br> People can't tell on themselves.<br> That's the type you are.<br> Oh for heaven sake!<br> I don't like the executive type.<br> What you can see in him is beyond me.<br> Well, he asked me to marry him...<br> ...during the clearance sale.<br> Did you even consider it?<br> To be honest, I did.<br> Well, why didn't you?<br> I didn't know whether I loved him.<br> Maybe I'd be marrying him for his money.<br> Has he got money?<br> Oh, he makes $55 dollars a week.<br> Fifty five dollars.<br> I don't see how a woman can<br> marry a man with money.<br> She'd always feel that maybe...<br> Maybe she'd married him not for what he was...<br> ...but, for what he has.<br> There'd always be that doubt between them.<br> Oh my...<br> Don't you feel weel?<br> Elizabeth...<br> I wonder if you'd care...<br> ...for the real me.<br> I think I know the real you.<br> I may not be exactly as I<br> appear on the surface.<br> Well, noones really perfect.<br> I'm not.<br> What do you mean, on the surface?<br> Are you married or something?<br> No, no, no...<br> Then what is it?<br> Well, I uh...<br> I've got a very weak stomach.<br> You put your stomach in my hands.<br> Oh, our station!<br> Good night, Mary. It was lovely.<br> To Whom It May Concern:<br> Thomas Higgins is employed in a confidential capacity...<br> See you tomorrow, Mary. Good night.<br> Hello...<br> Hello!<br> Dorothy, I'm sorry to get you<br> out of bed so late<br> but this is very...<br> ...this is very important.<br> Do you still go with that fellow<br> that works in the personnel department?<br> Yes. I do.<br> Well, give me his telephone number.<br> I have to speak to him tonight.<br> It's for you, Sam.<br> Yeah?<br> Uh, Sam, Sam, listen...<br> We're in terrible trouble. Meet me at<br> the employees entrance right now?<br> Now?<br> You mean this late?<br> Yes, now!<br> Thomas Higgins: Private Detective.<br> Salary billed to Philadelphia office, Merrick Enterprises.<br> So long as there's a chance we can win...<br> ...I'm going to stick.<br> Yes, dear.<br> They locked me out of my room.<br> Can I sleep on your roof?<br> Yes, dear.<br> What's a matter with you, honey?<br> Mary!<br> Mary, I'm back.<br> Don't take it so hard.<br> I'm going to stay here.<br> Yes, dear.<br> Good night, Joe.<br> Good night, honey.<br> I won't see you for breakfast.<br> I'm starting out real early.<br> Well, you can have breakfast.<br> Hm-hmm. Good night.<br> Remember the list with the 400 names?<br> Hm-hmm.<br> Where do you think that it is?<br> Down on the sand at Coney.<br> It's in Higgins' pocket.<br> And he's a spy for the store.<br> What?<br> Who? Who? Higgins?<br> And there's no mistake.<br> And he's got all those names?<br> All those poor people.<br> And it's my fault.<br> Where does he live?<br> I'll get that list back tonight.<br> I don't know.<br> Tomorrow. You get him in the stock room.<br> I'll get that list.<br> How are you going to get in the store?<br> Don't worry how I get in the store.<br> You get him in the stockroom, see?<br> And I'll join you.<br> And I'll get that list if<br> I have to hit over the head.<br> Will you please sign, Mr. Hooper?<br> Our friend Higgins, seems to be<br> a little late this morning.<br> Probably drinking last night.<br> Oh, he only had three beers.<br> You were with him yesterday?<br> I...we...<br> ...Mary and Tom...<br> ...No, just Tom and I.<br> Mr Higgins and I went to the beach.<br> He asked me before you did, really.<br> That's perfectly alright.<br> Ah, who have we here?<br> Good morning, Elizabeth.<br> Good morning, Mr. Higgins. Tom.<br> We're a little late this morning aren't we?<br> Oh, did you come late too?<br> You are a little late this morning.<br> Yes, I am.<br> And why may I ask?<br> Because I overslept. I was tired.<br> Well that's a novel excuse.<br> Well, it's true.<br> I don't like your tone of voice.<br> I don't like yours either.<br> Who do you think you're talking too?<br> Just another employee in the store.<br> That's all. And a darn poor one at that.<br> Do you know what's going to happen to you?<br> You're going to be fired.<br> I'm going to be fired?<br> Yes.<br> Let me tell you something!<br> You're going to be fired. How do you like that?<br> Five pair of these hightops come back<br> on the exchange.<br> Ha. Give me my 10 dollars.<br> Bring them in here.<br> Hey, where's my money?<br> You shouldn't have done that, Tom.<br> Why not?<br> I'm entitled to common courtesy.<br> It doesn't work that way.<br> The trouble with you people is...<br> ...you have no faith in employers.<br> Well, where's my sale book?<br> I'm worried about him.<br> Elizabeth, you know, you've,<br> you've lead a very sheltered life.<br> Now, men aren't exactly what they seem to be.<br> Some men are wonderful.<br> Other men are beasts, like...<br> Well, like other men.<br> Oh, honey. Joe will come back.<br> It isn't Joe.<br> I'm talking about a particular party.<br> Who thinks nothing of toying with<br> the heart of good woman.<br> How'd you like what I said to Hooper?<br> You were very brave, but foolhardy.<br> Mr. Higgins, would you be kind enough to<br> assist me in the stockroom?<br> Is it necessary?<br> Most necessary.<br> Well, what happens?<br> Uh...there's been a lot of trouble in here.<br> Uh...there should be a right shoe and<br> a left shoe in everyone of these boxes...<br> ...and lately there's been a right<br> shoe with a right shoe...<br> ...there ought to be a right shoe<br> with a left shoe.<br> What's that again?<br> Uh, look, you just open every box<br> and see that there's a right shoe<br> and left shoe in it. I'll be right back.<br> Mr. Higgins!<br> Mr. Higgins.<br> Tom!<br> Tom!<br> Tom! Tom, say something.<br> Say something. Oh dear.<br> Is this Higgins?<br> Yes.<br> Are you Jones?<br> Yes.<br> He's drunk.<br> He is not!<br> Come on you two.<br> The general manager wants to see you. Up.<br> Where am I?<br> Where are you taking me?<br> To the general manger's office.<br> Is that how he makes<br> people go to his office? Oh!<br> You must feel pretty good, Mr Higgins.<br> You'll probably get a raise<br> after they fire all of these poor people.<br> You Benedict Arnold in sheep's clothing.<br> I'll show you who's a Benedict Arnold<br> in sheep's clothing!<br> You watch!<br> Is this the way you discharge<br> your responsibilty?<br> Can't you understand that dealing with<br> people the way you do is the reason<br> for this civil war around here?<br> I've worked with these people.<br> They have rights.<br> What do you suggest?<br> I suggest that you get a different job...<br> ...if you can't get the confidence of<br> your employees. You bumble-witted idiot!<br> Tom...<br> Tom, this is wonderful what you're doing.<br> And you'll never regret it.<br> Let them fire you.<br> As long as there's a breath in my<br> body you'll never go hungry.<br> Calling me names isn't the solution.<br> I'd like nothing better than to get<br> the confidence of my employees.<br> But, who can I talk to?<br> Who represents enough of these people?<br> Would you consider 400 enough?<br> Yes, I would.<br> There's our representative.<br> Where are your 400 names?<br> There's the catch.<br> He wants the names.<br> See? My hands are tied.<br> This isn't a trick is it?<br> Do I look like I'm lying to you?<br> No. You don't.<br> Mary, you can't.<br> If there's a right way, this is it.<br> We're not being fair to him.<br> If we want him to trust us we<br> have to trust him.<br> Well, I'm against it.<br> I'm taking a big chance too, Joe.<br> I...If this doesn't go I loose you.<br> Alright, honey.<br> Well, Tom, have you got the list<br> you picked up on the beach last night?<br> Yes, I have.<br> Give it to Mr. Allision, please.<br> It's going to be terrible if you<br> fool these two young people.<br> You old fool. How dare you come into my<br> office and talk to me like you did.<br> I can outwit morons like you everyday<br> of the week and twice on Sundays.<br> Which is why I sit behind this desk,<br> while you stand in front of it.<br> Why, you!<br> Hooper, get that paper!<br> Keep your hands off of her!<br> Harley, McGinnis, come in!<br> Ahh!<br> You idiots<br> Both of you, I discharge you!<br> Eat it! Eat it!<br> Give me that paper! Give me that!<br> Stop it! Stop it I say you idiots!<br> Stop it! Oh!<br> Stop it! Stop it I say!<br> Why! You mashing brute!<br> Give me that paper!<br> Stop it I say!<br> How dare you!<br> I'll have you discharged!<br> Every one of you!<br> Now, you simpleton!<br> I'll show you who can outwit who.<br> Who're you going to fire now?<br> You give me the name of everyone on that list<br> or I'll fire the entire 5th floor for starter.<br> That's not fair. Many people on the<br> Every name or else they all go.<br> Every one of them.<br> Get out of my way!<br> Discharge slips.<br> For everyone on the 5th floor.<br> Yes, sir...<br> How dare you! What do you mean?!<br> Hold that door! Get it open!<br> Help me Tom!<br> Stop that! Take it out!<br> Employees! Listen to me everybody!<br> Come out to Bryant Park!<br> Don't be afraid! Everybody together!<br> If we all walk out now we got them licked!<br> Come out to Bryant Park.<br> Drop what you're doing and come<br> out to Bryant Park.<br> Ouch!<br> If we all get together now<br> they can't stop us!<br> Here we go! Everybody out!<br> Leave what you're doing.<br> Don't just stand there.<br> Move! Go on, walk! Everybody Together!<br> Come out to Bryant Park, don't be afraid!<br> If we all walk out at once<br> we got them licked!<br> Come out to Bryant Park!<br> Shhh! Picket...Picketing your house.<br> George. I'm worried.<br> Elizabeth won't marry me.<br> A man with money.<br> Maybe, in your case, she'll make an exception.<br> Do you think so?<br> Maybe.<br> No.<br> No.<br> No, it's against her principles.<br> She'll have to know sometime.<br> Right now!<br> Don't get excited, J.P.<br> We'll call the police.<br> Nobody's going to call anybody.<br> I'm going to send for the ringleaders<br> and have it out right now.<br> You wait in there.<br> Excellent idea. We'll handle them.<br> How do I get out the back way?<br> This way, sir.<br> Get my hat.<br> Tommy, you son-of-a-gun!<br> There he is!<br> Tom, where have you been?<br> Mary! Here he is!<br> We got a surprise for you.<br> You've got a surprise for me?<br> Yup, look.<br> We decided that nobody was to have<br> the honor of carrying this but you.<br> Come on, folks, we have to keep moving.<br> Wait!<br> They're waiting inside there<br> to meet with us.<br> What?!<br> Tom, how did you arrange it?<br> It wasn't hard.<br> Oh Tom, that's wonderful!<br> Come on, in we go.<br> This is it folks.<br> Get rid of that old fool.<br> Elizabeth!<br> You do like me, don't you?<br> Of course I do, Tom.<br> Just the way you are.<br> Oh my!<br> You sit here.<br> Well, let's begin.<br> That's right, let's begin.<br> Suits me.<br> We're ready.<br> You know you're not in a very<br> good bargaining position.<br> Maybe not, but the store's closed.<br> We can open it again!<br> And very easily!<br> Let's not raise our voices.<br> Yes, that's right.<br> Let's not raise our voices.<br> Uh, I don't know very much about business,<br> but, from a woman's viewpoint,<br> there are moral issues involved here.<br> Miss, we are not concerned with moral issues.<br> Why aren't we?<br> Because we aren't!<br> Moral issues are pretty important.<br> Oh. Uh...<br> I see your point of view.<br> Uh, could I have a word?<br> This may sound foolish but in my opinion of the<br> things that ought to be corrected in this store is...<br> Go on!<br> Well, there ought to be somebody in<br> the store's pet shop on Sunday.<br> All those canaries without water the whole day.<br> Canaries?<br> That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard!<br> Talking about canaries at a time like this!<br> That's purely idioitic!<br> There's nothing idiotic about it!<br> Certainly! There's nothing idiotic about it!<br> There are moral issues involved.<br> How can you say a thing like that?<br> Uh, Excuse me.<br> (Crying)<br> Madam, have you gone mad?<br> Take your hands off him!<br> Let go of Mr. Merrick!<br> Let go of Mr. Higgins!<br> Are you alright, Mr. Merrick?<br> Are you hurt, Mr. Merrick?<br> Are you hurt, Mr. Merrick?<br> Are you alright, Mr. Merrick?<br> Are you hurt, Mr. Merrick?<br> Are you alright, Mr. Merrick?<br> Elizabeth, money isn't everything.<br> You could learn to love me.<br> Mary, you see my side of it.<br> Say something!<br> Joe!<br> Hey, that's my wife you've got there.<br> This one's yours.<br> Ignore him.
