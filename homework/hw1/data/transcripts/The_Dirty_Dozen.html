I'm sorry!<br> I didn't. . . . Sir? Sir?<br> It won't happen again, sir.<br> I didn't want. . . .<br> I didn't. . . .<br> Private Arthur James Gardner. . .<br> . . .you've been found guilty<br> as charged for the crime of murder.<br> Your case has been appealed<br> three times. . .<br> . . .and reviewed three times.<br> The verdict of each court-martial<br> has been the same:<br> Guilty as charged.<br> Do you have anything to say before<br> sentence is carried out?<br> I didn't mean it.<br> l-- I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Open it up.<br> Enjoy the show, major?<br> I want to see Major Armbruster.<br> -Just down the corridor--<br> -Yeah, I know where it is. I know.<br> John. Good to see you.<br> Don't you give me that. We had<br> dinner last night together, remember?<br> Be nice. Take it easy.<br> This time it's serious, John.<br> You've gotta cooperate.<br> Let's go.<br> Colonel.<br> General is waiting, major.<br> Major Reisman, sir.<br> Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.<br> -Sit down, major.<br> -Thank you, sir.<br> Well, major, what did you think<br> of the hanging?<br> Looked very efficient.<br> Then again, I'm not an expert.<br> I meant, how did you<br> personally feel about it?<br> It wasn't the nicest way<br> to spend an evening.<br> Well, it wasn't staged<br> for your entertainment, you know.<br> I hope Private Gardner<br> was aware of that.<br> -Private who?<br> -Private Gardner.<br> He was the object of the exercise.<br> There happens to have<br> been a reason, major.<br> I've got your service record here, major.<br> A lot of fireworks. A lot of transfers.<br> One tough scrape after another,<br> very short on discipline.<br> Very short on discipline.<br> I hear you did a pretty good job in Italy.<br> Then you loused it up by exceeding your<br> orders. And that's not the first time.<br> -I didn't write those reports, sir.<br> -What is that supposed to mean?<br> I don't necessarily agree<br> with what's in them.<br> -Maybe you'd like to write your own?<br> -No, thank you, sir.<br> I'm not very interested in embroidery,<br> only results.<br> Now, you hold it right there.<br> This war was not started<br> for your private gratification.<br> And you can be damn sure<br> that this Army. . .<br> . . .isn't being run for your<br> personal convenience, either.<br> You've been waiting for a transfer<br> for over two months now.<br> With a record like yours,<br> you could go on waiting forever.<br> However, I get orders too.<br> And right now I've got some. . .<br> . . .that sound as if they were made<br> for somebody just like you.<br> Personally, I don't go for this<br> behind-the-lines nonsense.<br> As far as I'm concerned, a soldier's job<br> is to wear his uniform and kill the enemy.<br> But that's another matter.<br> I'm gonna ask General Denton<br> to read these orders. . .<br> . . .just as they came down to us.<br> After, if you have any questions, ask.<br> Understand?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -General.<br> "Project Amnesty:<br> You will select 12 prisoners<br> sentenced to death. . .<br> . . .or long-term imprisonment for murder,<br> rape, robbery or other violent crimes.<br> Train these prisoners in as much of the<br> behind-the-lines operations. . .<br> . . .as they can absorb in a brief<br> but unspecified time.<br> You'll then deliver them secretly<br> to Europe and prior to the invasion. . .<br> . . .attack and destroy the target<br> specified: Overleaf. "<br> -That's all?<br> -That's all.<br> What about the target specified,<br> Overleaf?<br> Doesn't concern you now.<br> Well, what do you say, major?<br> I'd say it confirms a suspicion<br> I've had for some time now, sir.<br> Do you think we might share<br> that suspicion, major?<br> I think you should.<br> Since I'll have to assume we're<br> over here to win the war. . .<br> . . .it wouldn't pay to advertise. . .<br> . . .that one man we're working for<br> is a raving lunatic.<br> Now, that's enough, major. You're here<br> to be briefed on an operation.<br> You have permission to ask questions<br> about that operation.<br> You do not have permission<br> to make personal comments. . .<br> . . .concerning the officers<br> responsible for its conception.<br> -Now, is that clear?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Ask relevant questions or shut up.<br> Is it relevant to ask why I'm being<br> offered this mission?<br> It's not, as you say, being offered.<br> I'm volunteering.<br> Exactly, major.<br> I'm glad you look at these things<br> so realistically.<br> I don't mean to appear unduly cautious,<br> but if my personal survival. . .<br> . . .depends on the performance<br> of 12 deadheads. . .<br> . . .it might be helpful to know exactly<br> what I'm training them for.<br> Now, that's a very good question, major.<br> -Armbruster, let's have the basic outline.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> "The Germans are using a large chateau<br> near Rennes in Brittany. . .<br> . . .as a rest center and a conference<br> place for general staff officers. "<br> The target has no real<br> military value itself. . .<br> . . .but with these conferences, discussion<br> groups and the like going on. . .<br> . . .there's hardly a day when<br> there aren't a considerable number. . .<br> . . .of important general officers<br> in residence.<br> Usually with the benefit<br> of female companionship.<br> "Eliminating a number of senior<br> officers couldn't but have the effect. . .<br> . . .of disrupting<br> their chain of command. "<br> The idea is simply that our men<br> are dropped by parachute.<br> They enter the chateau and kill<br> as many senior officers as is possible. . .<br> . . .in the time available.<br> Naturally, the place is fortified<br> and heavily guarded.<br> Naturally.<br> What's the deal with the men?<br> None whatsoever. Let's have<br> no misunderstanding about that.<br> It's exactly what it says, an amnesty.<br> A temporary postponement.<br> You take it or leave it on that basis.<br> Like you say, sir, let's not<br> have any misunderstandings.<br> I don't like it. I think it stinks.<br> I've had enough of your insolence.<br> It's not a question of insolence<br> but of practicality.<br> I'm the guy that's being asked<br> to sell this idea. . .<br> . . .to 12 happy, smiling faces, right?<br> They do have an alternative way to go,<br> you know.<br> -That's no way for anybody to go.<br> -Oh, the hell you say, major.<br> Why, I know a lot of people<br> who should go exactly that way.<br> But that's beside the point.<br> Now, come on, major,<br> what's your basic objection?<br> These men are, by definition,<br> incapable of any discipline or authority. . .<br> . . .much less intensive training.<br> If there isn't a possibility<br> for a remission of their sentence. . .<br> . . .they have nothing to look forward to<br> and no reason to cooperate, right?<br> Got a point.<br> You got a point, major.<br> However, as you know,<br> I don't have the power. . .<br> . . .to reverse the findings<br> of a court-martial.<br> You do have the power to commute<br> the sentence of such a court.<br> -Excuse me, general.<br> -Yes?<br> You do have authority under the Visiting<br> Forces Act to make such a ruling.<br> -Visiting Forces Act?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> All right, major, you got a deal.<br> Let's say that if any of these men<br> distinguish themselves. . .<br> . . .then we will give serious consideration<br> to commuting their sentences.<br> That's no deal.<br> Who's to say whether they really<br> distinguish themselves or not?<br> You can leave that decision to me.<br> But remember, the other alternative<br> will apply with equal force.<br> Any breach of security,<br> any failure of discipline. . .<br> . . .those prisoners go right back<br> where they came from.<br> -Understood?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Good. Anything more, gentlemen?<br> Well, yes, sir. I noticed<br> Colonel Breed in the waiting room.<br> I wondered whether he was<br> connected with this operation.<br> -What if he is?<br> -I'd be very unhappy, sir.<br> Major, Colonel Breed<br> is your superior officer.<br> And you will behave<br> accordingly, at all times.<br> -Is that clear?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Now, it so happens that Colonel Breed<br> is not concerned with this operation.<br> But he is running the parachute school<br> where part of your training will be.<br> I don't want to hear any complaints,<br> from either of you.<br> Now, you've got a job to do,<br> mister, so move it.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Thank you, gentlemen.<br> Major Reisman seems to be heading<br> to his own court-martial.<br> He's the most ill-mannered,<br> ill-disciplined officer. . .<br> . . .it's ever been my displeasure to meet.<br> You think so, Denton?<br> You may be right.<br> But he's sure right about one thing.<br> Somebody up there must be<br> a raving lunatic.<br> Let's get Colonel Breed in here.<br> Open.<br> All right, you men,<br> this is an exercise period.<br> So exercise!<br> Major Reisman, Sergeant Bowren, sir.<br> -Have the prisoners fall in.<br> -Sir.<br> Prisoners, fall in.<br> All right, come on now. Get with it!<br> -Come on, come on.<br> -Move it!<br> Come on, move!<br> Hey, you, move, I said, move.<br> "Franko, V.R.<br> Death by hanging.<br> Vladek, M.<br> Thirty years' hard labor.<br> Jefferson, R.T.<br> Death by hanging.<br> Pinkley, V.L.<br> Thirty years' imprisonment.<br> Gilpin, S.<br> Thirty years' hard labor.<br> Posey, S.<br> Death by hanging.<br> Wladislaw, T.<br> Death by hanging.<br> Sawyer, S.K.<br> Twenty years' hard labor.<br> Lever, R.<br> Twenty years' imprisonment.<br> Bravos, T.R.<br> Twenty years' hard labor.<br> Jiminez, P.<br> Twenty years' hard labor.<br> Maggott, A.J.<br> Death by hanging.

Fall in line!<br> -Come on, move!<br> -Come on, come on. Turn around.<br> Come on, here! I said, get in line.<br> Straighten up your jacket there.<br> Get over there.<br> -All right, have them count off.<br> -Sir. Count off!<br> Let's see what they can do<br> with a little close-order.<br> -Hut, right!<br> -Right.<br> Left, march!<br> Hut, hut, hut, hut.<br> Two, three, four, hut, hut, hut.<br> Two, three.<br> Squad, halt!<br> About face!<br> Left, march!<br> Squad, halt!<br> Right face! At ease.<br> Now, what did I say to you?<br> Or maybe you don't understand English!<br> -What's the matter, Number 11 ?<br> -I got a pain.<br> -Where does it hurt?<br> -Well, I'll tell you. It's. . . .<br> I wish you would.<br> And do it correctly, please.<br> Oh, I don't have to say, sir, I. . . .<br> To you or anyone else.<br> And I don't have to march, either.<br> And I know the rules.<br> Why don't you have to march?<br> Because condemned men<br> don't have to drill.<br> And there's nothing you can<br> do about it, mister.<br> What's your name, son?<br> Eleven.<br> His name is Franko, sir.<br> Franko, come over here a minute.<br> Come on.<br> Look, you little bastard, either you<br> march or I'll beat your brains out.<br> Understand?<br> What'd you see, sergeant?<br> I saw the major attacked by the prisoner<br> and forced to defend himself, sir.<br> All right, have the prisoner<br> taken back to his cell.<br> Take his head, I'll get his feet.<br> Now let's see what they can do<br> with a little close-order.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Squad, ten-hut!<br> Right face.<br> Forward, march! Hut.<br> Squad, halt!<br> About face!<br> Forward, march!<br> General prisoner Franko, Victor, sir.<br> So how's the jaw?<br> If you're gonna act tough, you should<br> learn how to take care of yourself.<br> You really should.<br> You're worried about my jaw?<br> Franko's pain bothers the major?<br> You were a big man with<br> the syndicate back in Chicago?<br> You've seen my record.<br> Yeah, I've seen your record,<br> so let's knock it off, huh?<br> So, what happens first<br> when you hit London?<br> You get involved in a penny-ante stickup<br> and start blasting and kill some old guy.<br> And come away with what?<br> -What did you have when they got you?<br> -What did I have? What do you mean?<br> Come on, big shot.<br> How much money did you have?<br> I had enough.<br> Two pounds and 10 shilling.<br> That's almost 10 dollars.<br> You're gonna get yourself hung<br> for a lousy 10 bucks.<br> -What's that to you?<br> -Nothing.<br> Then why don't you get off my back?<br> You didn't come to visit me.<br> What do you want?<br> I don't care if they hang you<br> for 10 dollars or 10 cents.<br> It makes no difference to me.<br> But it just so happens that temporarily<br> I got a little pull around here.<br> And I might be able to get you<br> off the hook, if I wanted to.<br> Are you a general?<br> You're not a general, and only<br> a general can grant my reprieve.<br> Look, stupid.<br> I'm making you a proposition.<br> All I want from you<br> is a straight yes or no.<br> -You talk, I'll listen.<br> -Okay.<br> You either can sweat out the two days<br> you have before the hanging. . .<br> . . .or you join an outfit<br> that I'm putting together.<br> If you do that, I'll have you<br> out of here in less than 24 hours.<br> But you'll be worked to death, and<br> there's not a beating you won't take.<br> And then<br> when I'm satisfied with you. . .<br> . . .you'll go where the Army tells you.<br> Chances are you'll get killed anyway.<br> You don't know Victor Franko.<br> -Guard.<br> -All right, what's the deal?<br> What's the deal if I do stay alive?<br> -Might get off the hook.<br> -Count me in.<br> But you foul up once,<br> anywhere along the line, just once. . .<br> . . .and you'll be back here<br> at the end of a rope.<br> Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You think I want to die?<br> If you do, then you don't<br> know Victor Franko.<br> How come you speak German?<br> Because my old man was<br> a coal miner in Silesia.<br> If he didn't speak German,<br> he didn't dig coal and he didn't eat.<br> That was the language he spoke<br> when he came to the States?<br> Pretty tough job in those days.<br> Yeah, it still is.<br> I don't like officers,<br> not any of them, and I never have.<br> But you were one yourself,<br> weren't you?<br> Yeah, three lousy days.<br> Somebody must have thought<br> you'd make a good officer.<br> They made a big mistake, didn't they?<br> Well, I thought you claimed<br> he was going over the hill.<br> What the hell are you talking about,<br> "claimed"?<br> He was going over the hill.<br> My outfit was pinned down by<br> the worst crossfire you ever saw.<br> Half of them bleeding to death.<br> And this lover took off like a rabbit. . .<br> . . .with the medical supplies<br> on his back.<br> The only way to stop him<br> was to shoot him.<br> Anyhow, he had it coming.<br> Yeah. But you only made<br> one mistake, huh?<br> Guard.<br> You let somebody see you do it.<br> General prisoner Maggott, A.J., sir.<br> "Maggott, A.J. Death by hanging. "<br> Hey, midnight.<br> Be a real good boy, now, and maybe<br> I'll let you eat with the white folks.<br> Well, Maggott, I see you've got<br> a sense of humor.<br> The all-American hero,<br> laughing in the face of death.<br> They're not gonna hang me, major.<br> I never raped that evil slut. . .<br> . . .or any other creature.<br> The Lord gave me that woman<br> and told me to chastise her.<br> Then he told you to beat her<br> to death, huh?<br> I only do what I'm called on to do.<br> I was in a state of grace.<br> And that woman. . .<br> . . .she tried to soil my spirit.<br> Well, I'm sure you were, Maggott.<br> But it seems to me I remember<br> a quotation that goes like:<br> Vengeance is mine.<br> Vengeance is mine.<br> I will repay, sayeth the Lord.<br> Paul to the Romans, Chapter 12.<br> Exactly. Now, isn't that<br> supposed to mean. . .<br> . . .that we leave punishment<br> of the transgressors to his hands?<br> That's right, major.<br> That's exactly what it means.<br> But it doesn't restrict him to the kind<br> of tools he would use, now does it?<br> And like I told you, major,<br> I only do what I'm called on to do.<br> You know, Maggott, I don't think<br> you're going to hang after all.<br> I think a man like you is destined<br> for higher things. Guard.<br> Besides, us Southern boys have<br> to stick together now, don't we?<br> I sure didn't mean to kill that fella.<br> But you do like I say,<br> and maybe they won't hang you.<br> Fixing to kill me some other way?<br> It might not come to that.<br> I reckon the folks would be a sight<br> happier if I died like a soldier.<br> Can't say I would.<br> Who does this hotshot major<br> think he is?<br> Making us play wet nurses<br> to a bunch of scum.<br> Corporal Morgan.<br> If you can't find something to do,<br> I'll find something for you.<br> Now, move it.<br> Don't sweet-talk me, whitey.<br> You know why I'm here.<br> Or maybe you think I should've let<br> those cracker bastards. . .<br> . . .go right ahead and castrate me?<br> Seeing what those guys<br> tried to do to you. . .<br> . . .I'd say that you had<br> considerable justification.<br> Thank you, Mr. Major, sir.<br> I really do thank you for that.<br> But the court didn't agree, right?<br> So where does that leave you?<br> I'm offering you an alternative,<br> which means you can keep fighting.<br> -Who for, major?<br> -For yourself, if you want.<br> But the Krauts,<br> they're the real master-race merchants.<br> That's your war, man, not mine.<br> You don't like the Krauts,<br> major, you fight them.<br> Me, I'll pick my own enemies.<br> That's your privilege. But you won't<br> be able to exercise it much longer.<br> Guard.<br> Because on March 25th,<br> you have a date with the hangman.<br> That's just six days from now.<br> Buenos das, major.<br> You know, sergeant, going over<br> the transcript of that man's trial. . .<br> . . .there are a couple of things<br> I don't get.<br> Did he ever claim<br> that he didn't do it?<br> I beg your pardon, but you haven't been<br> around prisons very much, have you?<br> You see, the first thing one learns<br> in prison, everybody is innocent.<br> This one, he doesn't say too much<br> about that one way or another.<br> He's only disturbed because we don't<br> allow him to have strings for his guitar.<br> Sergeant, did you ever lose a man. . .<br> . . .because he hung himself<br> with a guitar string?<br> No, sir, I haven't,<br> and I'm not about to.<br> Well, if he makes the trip,<br> see he gets the strings.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Attention!<br> -Tell the men to be seated.<br> -Yes, sir. Take seats!<br> -Guards out.<br> -Sir, l--<br> -Guards out.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> You heard him. Guards, out!<br> My name, for those of you<br> who may have forgotten, is Reisman.<br> You've all volunteered for a mission<br> which gives you just three ways to go:<br> You can foul up in training and be sent<br> back here for execution of sentence. . .<br> . . .or you can foul up in combat. . .<br> . . .in which case<br> I'll blow your brains out. . .<br> . . .or you can do as you're told,<br> in which case you might just get by.<br> You must not attempt to escape.<br> There will be no excuses,<br> there will be no appeal.<br> Any breach of either of these conditions<br> by any one of you. . .<br> . . .means you'll all be shipped back<br> for immediate execution of sentence.<br> You are therefore dependent<br> upon each other.<br> Any one of you try anything smart. . .<br> . . .and the 12 of you get it<br> right in the head, all right?<br> So try to remember that.<br> Now, are there any questions?<br> Sir?<br> Do we have to eat with niggers?<br> It's all right.<br> The gentleman from the South. . .<br> . . .made some kind of inquiries<br> about the dining arrangements.<br> He and his colleagues are discussing<br> the place-card settings.

Could you do it?<br> If you had to kill somebody with a knife,<br> do you think you could do it?<br> -Come on. Tell me.<br> -I'd rather not.<br> I don't care what you'd rather do.<br> Come on, stick that knife in me.<br> You can do that. Come on.<br> Major, I don't want to do this.<br> Come on, Posey. Just stick it<br> right here in me, it won't hurt.<br> Come on.<br> -I don't want to hurt you.<br> -You're not.

What a name for a guy like you.<br> -Stop!<br> -Don't tell me what to do.<br> -I'm giving orders.<br> -I don't like pushing.<br> Give it to him, Pose! Come on!<br> I don't like to be shoved.<br> Stop pushing!<br> Posey. Posey!<br> -Posey.<br> -Yes, sir?<br> Are you all right?<br> Yeah.<br> All right, now. Relax.<br> Come on, get up.<br> You know, you learn how to take care<br> of that temper of yours. . .<br> . . .ain't nobody gonna take<br> this knife away from you.<br> You're right. I'm sorry.<br> Okay, major. We're all set.<br> All right, you go in<br> and see Captain Kinder.<br> -What's he gonna do?<br> -He's just gonna talk to you, Posey.<br> -Brush yourself off and go on in.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> All right, which<br> of you gentlemen is next?<br> Come on. I'm looking for a volunteer.<br> All right, Maggott. You're next.<br> Speed it up, men.<br> Come on, speed it up.<br> They're looking good.<br> Yes, sir. I hope they don't forget<br> what they're getting in shape for.<br> Captain Kinder figures<br> maybe he can teach me letters.<br> Folks back home would be proud<br> if I could write.<br> Well, that would put you way ahead<br> of most of the guys around here.<br> -Better fall in and join them.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> It's true that I've been blessed. . .<br> . . .with an insight into women<br> that others don't have.<br> And sometimes. . . .<br> Well, sometimes I'm called upon. . .<br> . . .to use it in our beloved master's will.<br> If women are your special province, why<br> do you hate Major Reisman so much?<br> There are 11 evil men out there. . .<br> . . .and they must be punished<br> for their wickedness.<br> And this Major Reisman,<br> he just snatched them up. . .<br> . . .from the brink of the pit, and he<br> cheated the master of his vengeance.<br> And you think that's what God wants?<br> To punish these men?<br> Oh, he will, captain. He will.<br> And Major Reisman too.<br> -So, what does that give you?<br> -It doesn't give me anything.<br> But along with these other results,<br> it gives you. . .<br> . . .about the most twisted, anti-social<br> bunch of psychopathic deformities ever.<br> And the worst, the most dangerous<br> of the bunch is Maggott.<br> You've got one religious maniac,<br> one malignant dwarf, two near-idiots. . . .<br> And the rest, I don't even want<br> to think about.<br> Well, I can't think of a better way<br> to fight a war.<br> The results of these tests<br> point to the fact that each man. . .<br> . . .has a built-in resentment against<br> any kind of authority. Any kind.<br> -Don't you?<br> -But this is different.<br> These guys think the U.S. Army<br> is their enemy, not the Germans.<br> Well, they know the U.S. Army.<br> But the Krauts haven't done<br> anything to them yet.<br> Very sophisticated.<br> Well, at least they know the U.S. Army.<br> You can twist it any way you want.<br> But the point is. . .<br> . . .you are their main enemy.<br> And when the time comes,<br> you'll be the number one target.<br> Well, at least it gives them<br> something in common.<br> What do you mean?<br> They've come a long way individually,<br> further than we have a right to expect.<br> But not as a unit. Not as a group.<br> They've gotta function as a team.<br> And that's what's lacking.<br> You think putting them<br> on guard duty will help?<br> Well, it might give them<br> a sense of participation.<br> Why don't you let me weed out<br> the real morons? Especially Maggott.<br> I didn't pick these men, the Army did.<br> And I didn't pick the assignment either.<br> This is one time the Army's going<br> with a starting lineup all the way.<br> -Including Maggott?<br> -Including Maggott.<br> -Cheers.<br> -Cheers.<br> -We could get ourselves hurt, right?<br> -Why don't you shut up, huh?<br> What's the matter?<br> You planning to save your mother?<br> Why don't you lay off?<br> Want me to show you<br> how to do it, huh?<br> All right.<br> Take my arm, put it around your neck.<br> Very simple, right?<br> And then it's all in the leverage.<br> Better learn how to fall.<br> You'll end up in a wheelchair.<br> That's what I tried to tell him.<br> Trouble is you just don't know<br> how to fall right. Here.<br> Slob. Ah, that's a bad attitude.<br> Kind of rough on the little fella,<br> aren't you? Like to try that with me?<br> Now, this is really quite simple.<br> I'm going to say a word,<br> and you come back at me. . .<br> . . .as fast as you can<br> with whatever comes to mind.<br> For instance, if I were to say<br> "happiness," you might say "children. "<br> I wouldn't say that.<br> Well, that was just an example.<br> But if I said "ambition,"<br> what would you say?<br> I wouldn't say anything.<br> Well, let's give it a try, okay?<br> -Weapon.<br> -Baseball.<br> -Knife.<br> -Dodgers.<br> -Officer.<br> -Pitcher.<br> You seem to be thinking about<br> just one thing, aren't you?<br> Yeah. What are you thinking about?<br> Well, you see, I don't want you<br> to think of just one thing.<br> I'd like for you to concentrate<br> on each word I throw at you. Okay?<br> Okay.<br> Food.<br> Cincinnati.<br> -Comfort.<br> -Chicago.<br> -Now, what made you say that?<br> -That's what I was thinking about.<br> The hell with it!<br> Franko, what is it this time?<br> How am I supposed to shave<br> in cold water?!<br> You're in the field now.<br> Where are you gonna get hot water?<br> The guards got hot water!<br> You got hot water!<br> -You're in the field!<br> -That's tough.<br> Right. How come you guys have<br> hot water and we don't?<br> You keep quiet!<br> You keep your big mouth shut.<br> -We ain't shaving in cold water!<br> -Not if all you don't.<br> You want us to shave in cold water?<br> Why don't you?<br> -That's right.<br> -Yeah!<br> Franko means it.<br> We ain't shaving. We ain't washing.<br> Not in cold water!<br> -Is that right?<br> -That's right!<br> The guards got hot, we won't use cold.<br> And you can't make us!<br> You're gonna get yourself<br> into hot water, Franko.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> You gonna hang us?<br> What can they do?<br> They can't do nothing!<br> -Nothing.<br> -Now what are you gonna do?<br> You know, I think Franko<br> might be right this time.<br> Yeah, shaving in cold water<br> won't make us any better soldiers.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> We got some trouble outside.<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear.<br> -All right, sergeant. Fall them in.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> All right, fall in. On your feet!<br> Come on, right over here, Posey!<br> Come on! Dress it up there. Get in line!<br> What's this about refusing to shave?<br> Who is refusing to shave?<br> -We are!<br> -Who is we?<br> We!<br> All those refusing to shave,<br> take one step forward.<br> So you want to stink, huh?<br> And maybe itch too?<br> Well, that's okay with me<br> because I don't have to smell you.<br> Sergeant, there will be no further<br> issue of shaving equipment. . .<br> . . .or the use of soap.<br> And there will be no more hot meals.<br> Just K rations.<br> Courtesy of Mr. Franko.<br> At ease.<br> -Hey, I really think we got something.<br> -Yeah, it's what the Navy calls "mutiny. "<br> No, no. Remember what I was saying<br> last night about 12 rugged individualists?<br> So?<br> You heard them. It was "we ain't gonna<br> do this and we ain't gonna do that. "<br> When I asked them to step forward,<br> even Posey joined.<br> I'll bet you he's been shaving<br> in cold water since he was a kid.<br> Boy, do I love that Franko.<br> That means that we are going to have<br> that much more time for work.<br> Right?<br> So now, if you. . . .<br> You "dirty dozen" have no objections. . .<br> . . .we will get our equipment. . .<br> . . .and we will start in right now.<br> Attention!<br> Ready, hut!<br> That's very good.<br> You look just like real soldiers.<br> Fall out!<br> Now, move it!<br> You're still the dirtiest soldiers<br> in this man's army. . .<br> . . .and you're getting<br> filthier every day.<br> But your training is almost over.<br> In two days, you'll be learning<br> how to jump with a parachute. . .<br> . . .and you'll learn quick.<br> This training will take place<br> at a regular Army base.<br> And I just want to remind you<br> that this operation is secret.<br> Top secret.<br> You will not be wearing dog tags.<br> You will not say anything to anyone.<br> Do you understand? Nothing.<br> Nothing!<br> One word, one slip<br> from any one of you. . .<br> . . .and the deal is off!<br> And you all know what that means,<br> right?<br> All right, serve it up.<br> All right, serve it up!<br> Colonel Breed won't like this secrecy bit.<br> He'll want to know.<br> -We're still top-priority, aren't we?<br> -You can't ignore his author--<br> -Do we have the juice?<br> -Yes, but Colonel Br--<br> Then I don't care<br> what Colonel Breed likes.<br> Look, you're supposed to be<br> the liaison officer.<br> I want you to get orders<br> to the highest echelon. . .<br> . . .stating to Colonel Everett<br> Dasher Breed. . .<br> . . .that a group, over which he will have<br> no authority, will be arriving Tuesday. . .<br> . . .and the identity of the men is secret.<br> Tell him we got a general with them. . .<br> . . .tell him anything you want, just get<br> that West Point bum off of my back.<br> A general, huh?<br> I'll see what I can do.<br> -I know you will.<br> -Hey, Franko. What is it, man?<br> -What kind of food is that?<br> -Pig face, serve it up!<br> What is it?<br> I don't know. I never ate<br> anything like this before.<br> I've stepped in it a couple of times,<br> but I never ate it.<br> What is it?<br> Did you ask what general?<br> Yes, sir. Got the same thing again.<br> No information beyond<br> what was in the order.<br> What about General Denton?<br> When we first called, his extension<br> was busy. Now he's not there.<br> Not now.<br> -Well, what about you?<br> -Nothing, sir.<br> Not now, you. . . .<br> I think they're coming.<br> Yeah, it's them.<br> Yes? Sir, they just passed<br> the checkpoint.<br> Let's go.<br> Now.

I suppose it could.<br> I mean, there might be a way.<br> What I mean is,<br> general, if you recall. . .<br> . . .next week we've got divisional<br> maneuvers in Devonshire.<br> Yes, yes, yes.<br> Colonel Breed's outfit will be<br> part of that exercise.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> one of his companies. . .<br> . . .has been assigned the defense<br> of divisional headquarters.<br> So?<br> So. . . .<br> So you let my 12 men act<br> as an independent unit. . .<br> . . .attached to the opposing force.<br> And they'll knock out Breed's<br> headquarters and capture his entire staff.<br> That I'd like to see.<br> So would I.<br> Charlie and Fox Companies will support<br> the back of the woods.<br> They'll need supplies<br> from the 2nd Battalion.<br> Rogers won't like that,<br> but I don't want to hear about it.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -How's Johnson's armor?<br> They just ran through two minutes ago,<br> sir. The armor's all set.<br> Hold it!<br> Back!<br> Change!<br> You think we're gonna<br> get away with this?<br> Smile, you idiots!

D-day.<br> We get out as best we can<br> and make our way to the coast.<br> And hope that the entire invasion<br> hasn't been a total disaster.<br> Otherwise, we got a long swim home.<br> How much longer, major?<br> I'll ask the driver.<br> You're not worried about jumping<br> at night, are you?<br> Getting back.<br> Ready.<br> Cargo.<br> Go.<br> -Where have you been?
