I know better.<br> Well, don't let's talk about me.<br> Tell me about Dorothy, Paul.<br> Well, we're still married.<br> Oh, just that?<br> I've heard your name quite often, Jerry.<br> - From whom?<br> - Dorothy.<br> Oh, why?<br> She knows that I loved you, Jerry.<br> That I always have and always will.<br> My dear, you don't mean that.<br> You're not going to tell me<br> that love is anything lasting.<br> I've tried to forget that.<br> Forever and a day, Jerry. And after that.<br> Oh, I've made such a mess of it, Paul.<br> I'm so tired.<br> Forgive me, Jerry.<br> I didn't mean to upset you.<br> I'm so tired.<br> You brought back so much.<br> Oh, I... I'm so fed up.<br> I've made such a wreck of things.<br> Such a good for nothing mess.<br> Well, what is it, dear. What's the matter?<br> I'm just dizzy. I can't see.<br> Oh, I'm not going to faint,<br> but I'm just...<br> Jerry, take it easy, please.<br> It's all right, dear.<br> Oh, you mustn't let yourself go this way.<br> Come on, dear. It's all right.<br> It's all right, Jerry.<br> You're just worn out, you're tired.<br> It's all right, Jerry.<br> It's all right, dear.<br> I'll see you in the morning.<br> Oh, listen, old man.<br> Jerry's pretty tired<br> and she's not feeling well,<br> but I think she'll sleep.<br> So if I were you, I wouldn't go back.<br> You assume some rights, do you not?<br> You are not her guardian.<br> - No, but you're not going back.<br> - No?<br> - We shall see.<br> - I mean it.<br> Oh.<br> Good old American custom, eh,<br> minding other people's business?<br> What sentimental slop!<br> You are not protecting an innocent girl.<br> - She is nothing more...<br> - Why, you...<br> That's another good old American custom.<br> - Oh, porter?<br> - Yes?<br> There's only supposed to be one person<br> in Drawing Room A, isn't there?<br> - Yes, boss.<br> - Well, see that's how it is. Get me?<br> I get you.<br> Did he hurt you, boy?<br> Go away!<br> Mmm-mmm!<br> He's got a kick on him<br> like a Missouri mule.<br> What are you thinking of?<br> Oh, how nice it is.<br> And how much you can shake off<br> with just a little change in environment.<br> Happy? You look great.<br> I told you what a couple of weeks<br> would do for you.<br> - Oh, it's been lovely, Paul.<br> - It's yours for the rest of your life, Jerry.<br> - With my compliments.<br> - Thank you.<br> Oh, Jerry,<br> I have here the confirmation of my<br> appointment to the Far East from my firm.<br> You like the idea, don't you?<br> If I can take you.<br> There's nothing anywhere without you.<br> What about Dorothy?<br> She'll be much happier, Jerry.<br> Our marriage hasn't meant anything.<br> She's always bitter and morbid.<br> Never lets me forget for a minute<br> the accident that disfigured her.<br> Oh, well, you know.<br> Poor Dorothy.<br> It hasn't been easy for you either,<br> has it, dear?<br> Oh, it's been fair enough, Jerry.<br> It's just that it hasn't mattered very much,<br> but now things are different.<br> I have this offer, it's interesting.<br> And most important, I found you.<br> Dorothy'll give me a divorce.<br> You and I can be married and...<br> And we'll be happy.<br> - You think so, Paul?<br> - I'm crazy about you, Jerry.<br> Always have been.<br> I believe you. I really do.<br> They want me to spend<br> five years in Japan.<br> You know, we can have a beautiful time.<br> Leave all our mistakes 7,000 miles<br> behind us.<br> It sounds grand.<br> We deserve a little happiness,<br> don't you think?<br> I think you do, Paul.<br> I think you deserve anything you can get.<br> (HANNAH CLEARS THROAT)<br> Beg pardon. Lunch will be ready<br> in just a minute, Miss Jerry.<br> Good news, Hannah.<br> - Nice here, eh?<br> - It's just heaven.<br> Of course I ain't heard any angels singing,<br> but aside from that...<br> Well, we've got to eat anyway.<br> Hey, come on.<br> Don't you know it's 4:00 in the morning?<br> The night is young<br> and we are practically children.<br> - Hello, Joe.<br> - How are you?<br> How about a table for six?<br> Harry, table for six in the other room.<br> HARRY: Right this way, please.<br> I want four specials<br> and two orders of turkey legs.<br> Oh, here we are. Right here.<br> Well, isn't New York a wonderful place?<br> You go to shows and you see legs.<br> You go to restaurants,<br> and they give you legs.<br> (LAUGHING)<br> Don't laugh, Joe. It's a serious matter.<br> - Don.<br> - Well, this is luck.<br> Well, you old son of a sea cook.<br> I didn't even know you were in New York.<br> I've been in Europe<br> for the last few months.<br> Just got back.<br> Well, you're doing a lot<br> of that sort of thing, aren't you?<br> Gee, I'm glad to see you.<br> Same here. How've you been?<br> Oh, fine. Lost my job yesterday.<br> And I'm nursing<br> a pretty, little hangover today.<br> - Outside of that, I'm great.<br> - That's tough. Anything I can do?<br> No, thanks. I'll work it out all right.<br> - Say, it seems ages since I've seen you.<br> - Mmm.<br> Seen any of the old mob?<br> Mmm-mmm.<br> I suppose you heard about Jerry and me?<br> - Yeah. Too bad.<br> - Oh, well. That's life.<br> Say, I'd like to get together with you, Don.<br> - Fine.<br> - How about tomorrow?<br> Tomorrow? I'm off again tomorrow.<br> - Canada, for a couple of weeks.<br> - Really?<br> - When I get back.<br> - Sure, if I'm here.<br> - Oh, you leaving town?<br> - Yes. New York's bad medicine.<br> A lot of things I want to forget.<br> I can't seem to do it very well around here.<br> I know exactly how you feel.<br> You see, I keep thinking<br> what a sad, little fellow I am,<br> and brooding over the man<br> that ruined my life.<br> - What would you do if you found him?<br> - Kill him, I suppose.<br> Funny, isn't it,<br> how one girl can be bigger<br> than all the tall buildings?<br> Well, I'll look you up.<br> When you get settled, let me know.<br> I may start and never stop.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> That's my specialty. Well, so long.<br> So long, Don.<br> She'll be in any minute now, Miss Helen.<br> She knows you're here.<br> - You going to Japan with them, Hannah?<br> - Oh, sure.<br> I want to see where the money's gone.<br> I've gave to foreign missions<br> for the heathen.<br> How soon are they starting?<br> Oh, I forget you've been honeymooning<br> so long you don't know anything.<br> His wife's going to let him loose.<br> It'll be soon, now.<br> Miss Jerry's gave up her job.<br> - Really? She's resigned?<br> - Mmm-hmm.<br> And her firm come right back with an offer<br> of $7,500 a year to go to London.<br> - They have branches in Europe.<br> - Hooray for Jerry.<br> Personally, I'd a darn sight rather go<br> to London than to Yokohokohamie.<br> - Hello there, darling!<br> - Jerry.<br> Well, globetrotter bride<br> and what have you.<br> Hello, yourself, you stormy petrel.<br> It's about time I came back.<br> Gee whiz, but I'm glad to see you.<br> Say, I've missed you<br> like the dickens, Helen.<br> You, getting yourself out of one upheaval<br> into another all the time.<br> Let me take a look at you.<br> Better be careful, darling.<br> My sea legs are still wobbly.<br> Now tell me, are you happy?<br> Yes, sure. Bill's a big shot in his way.<br> He stands without hitching.<br> Nice and secure, eh?<br> Yes, but... That other business.<br> You know, when you stand at the altar<br> with someone you're wild about<br> and the organ makes you dizzy<br> and you say,<br> "This is heaven and we'll last forever."<br> Of course, that's gone forever.<br> - I wish you hadn't said that, Helen.<br> - But why?<br> Well, that brings my leaping mind<br> back to its big news.<br> Big news?<br> We ran across Ted.<br> - Where?<br> - In Paris. Saw quite a lot of him.<br> What's he doing?<br> Trying to wreck a fairly good mind<br> and an A-1 body.<br> Really?<br> He's doing newspaper work,<br> for the time being.<br> Of course, it won't last.<br> Ask about me?<br> My dear, he hates you so hard,<br> I think he's still mad about you.<br> Oh, no, he's not.<br> Making a fool of himself, eh?<br> Oh, well, you know what<br> Americans do in Paris.<br> When they meet someone<br> who speaks American and knows Paris.<br> Ted was taking bets to see<br> how many nights in succession<br> he could stay drunk<br> without spending a cent for it.<br> He'd gone six weeks when we started.<br> You know, Bill's been crazy about him<br> ever since he broke up our wedding party.<br> It seems in the West<br> where men are so and so,<br> that, that's considered<br> a pretty good piece of work.<br> Well, anyhow,<br> I've been busting to tell you.<br> What a girl.<br> The lad I divorced is married again,<br> has a baby<br> and arrives in Wall Street<br> every morning at 9:00.<br> Helen!<br> (DOORBELL RINGING)<br> Oh, I guess that's Paul now.<br> - He'll be delighted to see you, Helen.<br> - I'll be very glad to see him.<br> Oh.<br> It's Dorothy, Jerry.<br> Oh, yes, of course. Come in, Dorothy.<br> I suppose I should have called you<br> and made a date.<br> Well, for heaven's sake, Dorothy.<br> Hello, Helen. I hear you've married again.<br> Yes, a big cattle and horse man.<br> Thanks for the tea, darling.<br> I must be going.<br> Buffalo Bill is waiting.<br> - I hope I didn't interrupt.<br> - Oh, no, not at all.<br> We're at the Ritz, dear.<br> Why don't you come over<br> and have dinner with us?<br> Sorry, I have a date for dinner.<br> - Helen!<br> - Hello, Paul.<br> Hello. Well, Jerry...<br> If anything happens to your date, dear,<br> come on over.<br> Thanks.<br> - Goodbye, Paul, see you later.<br> - Goodbye, Helen.<br> - Have some tea, Paul, won't you?<br> - No, thanks, Jerry.<br> Well, Dot, what are you doing here?<br> I just wanted to see Jerry<br> for a few minutes.<br> What did you want to say to her?<br> I guess I was going to ask her<br> not to take you from me.<br> But I've told you that Jerry has<br> no responsibility in the matter, Dot.<br> I thought that everything was all settled.<br> And besides, you said that we...<br> I know I said I'd set you free.<br> When you told me, my pride revolted<br> at holding you against your will.<br> But now that I've had time to think it over,<br> I have no pride, Paul.<br> Maybe our marriage hasn't meant much,<br> but there's nothing at all without it.<br> It does give me an excuse for living,<br> being married to you.<br> - There isn't anything else.<br> - Wait a minute, Dot.<br> You know that I'm not planning<br> to desert you.<br> I've made certain definite arrangements<br> to take care of you.<br> And that's everything in the world<br> I have for you, my dear.<br> I have a right to a chance at some kind<br> of personal life, haven't I?<br> Like anyone else?<br> Well, how about it, Dot?<br> Just a minute.<br> - Can't we talk afterwards?<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> I'm afraid she's right, Paul.<br> I couldn't do it.<br> I wouldn't dare expect to be happy.<br> Please, Paul, it hit me.<br> It brought back something.<br> Devastation just like this.<br> Only I deserved it.<br> Let me say it, Paul.<br> She married the man she loved. So did I.<br> Every woman does, if she can.<br> But Dorothy is just trying to hang on.<br> I didn't.<br> I see my way. I see it so clearly now, Paul.<br> I've never given my word<br> and broken it before, except once.<br> And that was the promise I made<br> on the altar with all my heart and soul.<br> Jerry I... This is just a storm.<br> - I'm terribly sorry.<br> - Oh, please.<br> You've saved us both<br> from a horrible mistake.<br> I'm really grateful.<br> This is right, Paul, and in our hearts<br> we've known it, haven't we?<br> Marriage is the one thing in the world<br> I thought ought to be perfect.<br> Nothing else is.<br> And when mine wasn't, I quit.<br> I don't know whether Ted could ever<br> give me another chance.<br> But wherever he is, I'm going to find him<br> and find out.<br> Jerry, if Ted doesn't come here,<br> we'll go over to Zelly's.<br> We may find him there.<br> We'll wait a while, Hank.<br> What do you think he'll do<br> when he finds you're in Paris?<br> Who can tell?<br> Why, there he is now!<br> - Is he alone?<br> - HANK: No.<br> BILL: Quite a party.<br> HELEN: Jerry,<br> don't you want to talk to him?<br> - Hank, will you take me over there?<br> - Why, certainly, Jerry.<br> Ted! Come on, Ted. Come on.<br> - Ted!<br> - Jerry!<br> What are you doing here?<br> Surprised?<br> Well, I thought when I put<br> the Atlantic Ocean between us,<br> I wouldn't be seeing you.<br> You should have found a wider ocean.<br> Don't you think it would be more Christian<br> if you'd give me a chance to forget you?<br> Do you still hate me that much, Ted?<br> Where's your husband?<br> Oh, he's not far away.<br> You do keep track of me, don't you?<br> That's why I left New York,<br> because I couldn't think of anything else.<br> I'm still a little groggy, Jerry,<br> but with time out I think I'll be able<br> to finish the game.<br> You deserve the best in the world, Ted.<br> There's no one that wishes it<br> for you more than I do.<br> Sure, I know.<br> And there's no reason on Earth<br> why we can't still be friends.<br> No, of course not.<br> I hope that, that other fellow gives you<br> the break you deserve.<br> I certainly didn't.<br> Well, here's everything, Jerry.<br> And happy New Year.<br> I'm working in London, Ted.<br> This is the third time I've been in Paris<br> looking for you.<br> - For me?<br> - Yes.<br> Why?<br> You see, I had to leave New York, too.<br> Couldn't forget that little church<br> and a lot of other things.<br> You're the only husband I've ever had<br> and ever want.<br> It's New Year in a minute, Ted.<br> All the world gets a new chance.<br> Don't kid me, Jerry.<br> I'd give my right arm for another chance.<br> I like that right arm.<br> How about putting it around me?<br> (PEOPLE CHEERING)<br> English - SDH<br>
