                        'German aircraft carried out<br> a number of attacks<br> 'on Great Britain last night.<br> 'The raids,<br> which lasted for several hours,<br> 'were scattered over many<br> parts of the country.<br> 'And the enemy aircraft has been...<br> AIR- RAID SIREN<br> '.. reported over towns on<br> the south coast,<br> 'the west of England, the North<br> Midlands and the north-west,<br> 'as well as over the London area. '<br> He does nothing but cry.<br> Are they keeping him in?<br> They wouldn't let me stay.<br> The doctor said<br> I seemed to make matters worse.<br> I should never have taken him<br> to the hospital.<br> I don't know what came over me.<br> I should have brought him<br> back here where he belongs.<br> Why is his coat on the floor?<br> And his hat?<br> Drying out. They're wet through.<br> Well, how did he come to<br> be in such a state, Norman?<br> When you telephoned, I thought<br> at first that he'd been hurt<br> in the air raid. Oh, no.<br> Or had an accident.<br> Oh, no, not an accident.<br> No, I know because they said there<br> was no sign of physical injury.<br> Your Ladyship. He's in a state<br> of collapse. Yes, I know.<br> Well, how did he get like that?<br> Your Ladyship... What happened to<br> him? Sit down. Please, sit down.<br> We must remain calm.<br> The doctor said it must have been<br> coming on for weeks.<br> Oh, if not longer.<br> Well, I didn't see him this morning.<br> He left the digs before I woke.<br> Where was he all day?<br> Where did you find him? Well, what<br> happened was this, Your Ladyship.<br> After the last "all clear" sounded,<br> I went into Market Square<br> just as dusk was coming on.<br> Peculiar light, ever so yellowish.<br> I'd hoped to find a packet or two<br> of Brown & Polson's cornflour,<br> since our supplies are rather low.<br> So I was asking at this stall<br> and that's when I heard his voice.<br> Whose voice?<br> Sir's, of course.<br> He was taking off his overcoat -<br> in this weather!<br> "God help the man who stops me,"<br> he shouted, and then<br> he threw the coat to the ground just<br> like King Lear in the storm scene.<br> Look at it. I don't know<br> that I'll ever get it clean.<br> And he was so proud of it,<br> do you remember...?<br> Oh, no, perhaps it<br> was before your time.<br> The first Canadian tour, Toronto.<br> What happened after<br> he took off his coat?<br> Started on the hat!<br> Dunn's, Piccadilly, only a year ago,<br> down on the coat it went and<br> he jumped on it, he stamped on his<br> hat, viciously stamped on his hat.<br> Well, you can see.<br> Then he lifted his arms in the air<br> like he does to convey<br> sterility into Goneril's womb, "How<br> much further do you want me to go?"<br> His fingers were all of a fidget,<br> undoing his jacket,<br> loosening his collar and tie,<br> tearing at the buttons of his shirt.<br> Were there many people about?<br> A small crowd.<br> That's why I ran to him.<br> I didn't want him to stand there<br> looking ridiculous<br> with people all around, sniggering.<br> Did he see you?<br> Did he know who you were?<br> I didn't wait to find out.<br> I just took his hand and I said,<br> "Good evening, Sir, shouldn't<br> we be getting to the theatre?"<br> in my best nanny voice, the one<br> I use when he's being wayward.<br> He paid no attention.<br> He was shivering.<br> You shouldn't have let the public<br> see him like that.<br> It's easy to be wise after<br> the event, if you don't mind<br> my saying so, Your Ladyship,<br> but I tried to spirit him away,<br> not easy with a man<br> of his proportions.<br> Only, just then...<br> .. a woman approached,<br> quite old, wearing bombazine<br> under a tweed coat<br> but perfectly respectable.<br> She'd picked up his clothes<br> and wanted to help him dress.<br> And Sir said to the lady,<br> "Thank you, my dear,<br> but Norman usually helps me.<br> "I'd be lost without Norman,"<br> and I thought,<br> "Well, this is your cue, ducky,"<br> so I said,<br> "I'm Norman, I'm his dresser. "<br> And the woman, she had her hair in<br> curlers, she took his hand,<br> she kissed it, and she said,<br> "You was lovely in<br> The Corsican Brothers. "<br> He looked at her for a long time,<br> then he smiled sweetly,<br> you know the way he does<br> when he's wanting to charm?<br> "Thank you, my dear,<br> but you must excuse me.<br> "I have to make an exit,"<br> and he ran off.<br> He said, "I have to make an exit"?<br> Well, of course, I followed him,<br> fearing the worst.<br> I didn't know he could run so fast.<br> I just followed this trail of<br> discarded clothing, the jacket,<br> the waistcoat, and I thought,<br> "We can't have Sir doing a<br> striptease round town. "<br> But then I found him.<br> Leaning up against a lamppost.<br> Weeping. Where?<br> Outside the Kardomah.<br> Without a word,<br> hardly knowing what I was doing,<br> I led him to the hospital.<br> The sister didn't recognise him,<br> although later she said she'd<br> seen him last night as Othello.<br> A doctor was summoned,<br> short, bald, bespectacled,<br> and I was excluded<br> by the drawing of screens.<br> And then you telephoned me.<br> No, I waited.<br> I lurked, as Edgar says,<br> and I heard the doctor whisper,<br> "This man is exhausted.<br> This man is in a state of collapse. "<br> And that's how it happened.<br> He did nothing but cry.<br> Yes, you said.<br> I left him lying on top of the bed,<br> still in his clothes, crying,<br> no, weeping, as though he'd lost<br> control, had no choice,<br> wept and wept, floodgates.<br> What are we to do?<br> In an hour there will be<br> an audience in this theatre<br> hoping to see him as King Lear.<br> What AM I to do?<br> Well, don't upset<br> yourself, for a start.<br> Well, I've never had to make this<br> sort of decision before.<br> Any sort of decision before.<br> As soon as I came out<br> of the hospital I telephoned Madge<br> and asked her to meet me<br> here as soon as possible.<br> She'll know what to do.<br> Oh, yes, Madge'll know what to do.<br> She won't upset herself,<br> that's for certain.<br> No, Madge will be ever so sensible.<br> I suppose stage managers have to be.<br> I had a friend once,<br> had been a vicar before falling from<br> the pulpit and landing on the stage.<br> Ever so good as an ugly sister.<br> To the manner born.<br> His wife didn't upset easily.<br> Just as well, I suppose,<br> all things considered.<br> Madge reminds me of her.<br> Cold, businesslike, boring.<br> The doctor took me into a little<br> room littered with enamel dishes<br> full of blood-stained bandages.<br> The smell made me faint.<br> He asked me<br> about his behaviour in recent days.<br> Had I noticed anything untoward?<br> And what did you say?<br> If you don't mind my asking.<br> I lied.<br> I said he'd been perfectly normal.<br> I don't want to appear neglectful.<br> I should have been more vigilant.<br> Only last night I woke...<br> Is that Madge? No, it's Irene.<br> You were saying?<br> Last night you woke.<br> He was looking at me. He was naked.<br> It was bitter cold,<br> he was shivering.<br> He said, "Thank you for watching<br> over me but don't worry.<br> "Just go on looking after me.<br> "I have the feeling<br> I may do something violent. "<br> Talk about untoward.<br> I'm glad you didn't<br> tell the doctors that,<br> they'd have locked him up for good.<br> Last night, after Othello,<br> he asked me,<br> "What do we play tomorrow, Norman?"<br> I told him King Lear and he said,<br> "Then I shall wake with<br> the storm clouds over my head. "<br> I should have made him rest.<br> The doctor said he'd come to the end<br> of his rope and found it frayed.<br> So would anyone that had to<br> put up with<br> what he's had to put up with.<br> You should've told<br> the doctor about the troubles.<br> No. Civilians never understand.<br> I could kick myself for taking him<br> to the hospital.<br> It was the right thing to do.<br> I hope so. Doctors.<br> Can you imagine trying to explain to<br> a doctor what Sir's been through?<br> "Well, you see, doctor,<br> he's been trying to recruit actors<br> "for his Shakespeare company and<br> all the able-bodied and best ones<br> "are in uniform, and the theatres<br> are bombed<br> "as soon as you book them. "<br> Doctors.<br> He'd have had his hypodermic<br> rampant before you could say<br> As You Like It.<br> Madge is right.<br> There is no alternative.<br> We'll have to cancel.<br> Oh, no, oh, Your Ladyship, no,<br> cancellation's ever so drastic.<br> He's ill.<br> There's no crime in being ill,<br> it's not high treason,<br> it's not a capital offence, it's not<br> desertion in the face of the enemy.<br> He's not himself. He can't work.<br> Will the world stop turning?<br> Will the Nazis overrun England?<br> One Lear more or less in the world<br> won't make any difference.<br> Sir always believes it will.<br> Who really cares<br> whether he acts or not?<br> I never imagined it would<br> end like this.<br> I've always thought<br> he was indestructible.<br> All the years we've been together.<br> Feels like a lifetime.<br> Even longer, he and I.<br> It'll be the first time<br> we've ever cancelled.<br> Look, I want to go to the hospital.<br> No, Norman.<br> I want to sit with him,<br> be with him<br> and try to give him some comfort.<br> I can usually make him smile.<br> Maybe when he sees me...<br> They wouldn't even let me stay.<br> I wish I could remember the name of<br> the girl who got me into all this.<br> Motherly type, she was,<br> small parts, play as cast.<br> I can see her face clearly.<br> I can see her standing there,<br> on platform two at Crewe,<br> a Sunday, I was on platform four.<br> " Norman," she called.<br> We'd been together in Outward Bound,<br> the number three tour,<br> helped with the wardrobe I did, and<br> understudied Scrubby, the steward.<br> That's all aboard a ship, you know.<br> It's a lovely first act.<br> "We're all dead, aren't we?"<br> And I say, "Yes, sir,<br> we're all dead. Quite dead. "<br> And he says, "How long have you<br> been... you been...? Oh, you know. "<br> "Me? Oh, I was lost young. "<br> And then he says,<br> "Where... where are we sailing for?"<br> And I say, "Heaven, sir.<br> And hell, too.<br> "It's the same place, you see. "<br> Lovely. Well,<br> to cut a short story shorter,<br> Sir wanted help in the wardrobe<br> and someone to assist generally<br> but, mainly, with the storm in Lear.<br> I've told you this before,<br> haven't I?<br> Put me on the timpani, he did.<br> And on the first night, after<br> the storm, while he was waiting<br> to go on for, "No, they cannot touch<br> me for coining", he called me over.<br> My knees were jelly.<br> "Were you on the timpani tonight?"<br> I said, "Yes, sir," fearing<br> the worst. "Thank you," he said.<br> "You are an artist. "<br> My father was exactly the same.<br> Always exaggerated his illnesses.<br> That's why I thought it was not<br> very serious, I thought...<br> Any further developments?<br> We had better see<br> the theatre manager.<br> Perhaps you ought to come with me.<br> Oh, no, Your Ladyship, please,<br> let's take our time,<br> let's not rush things.<br> There's no alternative.<br> Madge is right, we can't play<br> King Lear without the King.<br> We have to make a decision.<br> Forgive me, Your Ladyship, it's not<br> a decision you have to make,<br> it's the right decision.<br> I had a friend, in a very low state,<br> he was, ever so fragile,<br> a pain to be with.<br> You weren't safe from him<br> on top of a bus.<br> If he happened to sit beside you,<br> he'd tell you the ABC of unhappiness<br> between request stops.<br> Someone close to him, his mother,<br> I believe,<br> although it was never proved,<br> understandably upset,<br> made a decision.<br> "A little rest", she said,<br> "with others similarly off-centre,<br> "in Colwyn Bay", never a good date,<br> not in February,<br> wrapped in a grey rug,<br> gazing at a grey sea.<br> Talk about bleak.<br> Mother-dear made a decision<br> but it was the wrong decision.<br> And my friend never acted again.<br> We have to face the facts.<br> I've never done that in my life, Your Ladyship,<br> and I don't see why I should start now.<br> I just like things to be lovely.<br> Yes, but things aren't lovely,<br> Norman.<br> They aren't if you face facts.<br> Face the facts, it's facing<br> the company I worry about.<br> I'll be in Madge's office<br> if I'm wanted.<br> Don't decide yet, Your Ladyship,<br> let me go to the hospital,<br> let me see how he is,<br> you never know.<br> I do know. I realise now that I've<br> witnessed a slow running down.<br> I've heard the hiss of air escaping.<br> Norman! Norman!<br> Good evening, Sir.<br> Good evening, Norman.<br> Good evening, Pussy.<br> Bonzo, why are you here?<br> Well, my name is on the door.<br> Did the doctors say you could leave?<br> Doctors?<br> Executioners.<br> Do you know what he told me?<br> A short, bald butcher.<br> Il Duce in a white coat.<br> When a doctor tells you<br> you need rest, you can be certain<br> he has not the slightest<br> idea of what is wrong with you.<br> I discharged myself.<br> Telephone the hospital.<br> Do not telephone the hospital!<br> Norman, will you leave us, please?<br> I'll see Madge and tell her<br> there is an alternative.<br> Shh-shh!<br> You're fit for nothing.<br> Please, Pussy, don't.<br> Cancel the performance.<br> Can't, mustn't, won't.<br> Then take the consequences.<br> When have I not?<br> Where have you been all day?<br> Don't tell me<br> you found a brothel in this town.<br> I can't remember all I've done.<br> I know towards the evening<br> I was being pursued<br> but I couldn't see who<br> the villains were.<br> Then the air-raid warning went.<br> I refused to take shelter.<br> Wherever I went,<br> I seemed to hear a woman crying.<br> Then, suddenly,<br> I had a clear image of my father<br> on the beach near Lowestoft.<br> "An actor?" he said, "Never. "<br> "You will be a boat builder like me. "<br> But I defied him and lost his love.<br> Father preferred people to cower.<br> But I had to chart my own course.<br> I decide when I'm ready<br> for the scrapyard. Not you. I.<br> No-one else. I.<br> The woman you heard crying was me.<br> Norman! Sir.<br> I want you by me, Norman.<br> Yes, sir. Don't leave my side,<br> Norman.<br> No, sir. I shall need help, Norman.<br> Yes, sir. Madge.<br> You speak to him.<br> He doesn't listen to a word I say.<br> He's obviously incapable.<br> You look exhausted.<br> That's what I call tact.<br> Are you sure you're able to<br> go on tonight?<br> How long have you been with me?<br> Longer than anyone else.<br> Have I ever missed a performance?<br> No, but then you've never been ill.<br> I only want what's best for you.<br> What's best for Sir is that<br> he's allowed to get ready.<br> Ready, yes, I must get ready.<br> Ready for what?<br> If you'll excuse me, Your Ladyship,<br> shouldn't you be getting ready too?<br> I can't bear to see him like that.<br> Then best to leave us.<br> I've had experience of these things.<br> I know what has to be done.<br> Imagine waking to that<br> night after night.<br> SHE CHUCKLES<br> Right, shall we begin<br> at the beginning? Good evening, Sir.<br> "Good evening, Norman. "<br> And how are you this evening, Sir?<br> "A little tearful, I'm afraid.<br> And you, Norman?"<br> Oh, I'm very well, thank you.<br> I've had ever such a quiet day,<br> just ironing your costumes,<br> cleaning your wig and beard,<br> washing your undies.<br> And what have you been up to, Sir,<br> if I may ask?<br> "Oh, I've been jumping on my hat,<br> Norman. "<br> Have you? Well, that's an odd thing<br> to do. May one ask why?<br> "Why what, Norman?"<br> Why have we been jumping<br> on our hat, Sir?<br> SIR GRUMBLES<br> Shall we play I -Spy?<br> I spy with my little eye something<br> beginning with...<br> A.<br> I know you won't guess,<br> so I'll tell you.<br> A is for actor.<br> And actors have to work, and actors<br> have to put on their make-up<br> and change their frocks and then,<br> of course, actors have to act.<br> Good lord. Zounds, madam,<br> where dost thou get this knowledge?<br> From a baboon, sir,<br> that wandered wild in Eden.<br> Or words to that effect.<br> There's less than an hour to go<br> and you usually want more.<br> So, come on, shall we make a start?<br> Yes, it's me, Norman,<br> the one with the soulful eyes.<br> There.<br> Drink up. It's tea, not rat poison.<br> There you go, that's better,<br> isn't it? Isn't it?<br> Would you like a biccie?<br> I saved some from the mayor's<br> reception in Bridlington.<br> No?<br> Would you like one, Norman?<br> Ooh, I say.<br> Thank you, I will.<br> If you don't mind my saying so, Sir,<br> there seems little point<br> in discharging yourself<br> from hospital and then coming to<br> sit here like Niobe prior<br> to being turned into stone.<br> So, shall we make a start?<br> No, no, don't do that.<br> That's what I'm here for.<br> HE SOBS<br> Ohh!<br> Oh, I know how it feels.<br> I had a friend,<br> worse than you, he was,<br> and all they ever wanted to do<br> with him was put him away.<br> And no-one should have to<br> go through that.<br> That's what my friend said.<br> You know they'll send you<br> to Colwyn Bay<br> and you never do any<br> business in Colwyn Bay.<br> And guess what got my friend well?<br> Sounds silly this.<br> An offer of work.<br> Can you understudy Scrubby?<br> Outward Bound, start Monday.<br> He discharged himself, just like<br> you, my friend did, took the train<br> up to London, found digs<br> in Brixton and never looked back.<br> What do you make of that?<br> An offer of work.<br> It meant that someone...<br> .. was thinking of him.<br> It was ever such a comfort.<br> And here's something<br> to cheer you up.<br> A full house tonight.<br> People thinking of you,<br> wanting to see you act.<br> Really? A full house?<br> Now, shall we make a start?<br> What play is it tonight?<br> King Lear, Sir.<br> That's impossible.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Oh, that's nice, isn't it(?!)<br> People paying good money to see you<br> and you say "impossible".<br> Very nice indeed(!) I don't think.<br> I don't want to be seen.<br> Well, that's difficult<br> when you're playing King Lear<br> with the lighting you use.<br> I don't want to see her ladyship.<br> Oh, well, even more difficult<br> when she's playing your daughter.<br> You saw her a moment ago.<br> You were alone together.<br> Were we?<br> What play is it tonight?<br> King Lear, Sir.<br> Madge was wrong.<br> Yes, well, she often is.<br> I have been ill before this.<br> Did you ever see me in<br> The Corsican Brothers?<br> Ah, no. Alas, sir, before my time.<br> I went on with<br> double pneumonia then.<br> Apt when you're playing<br> the Corsican brothers.<br> I'd rather have<br> double pneumonia than this.<br> Than what?<br> What prevents me from packing up<br> and going home?<br> Why am I here<br> when I should be asleep?<br> Wasn't that a strange light<br> in Market Square this evening?<br> I don't remember<br> being in Market Square.<br> You've been missing whole days.<br> What do you remember?<br> Walking, walking, walking. If only<br> I could find a good, catchy title.<br> I think My Life a little plain,<br> don't you?<br> Still stuck, are we?<br> No, no. I wrote a little today.<br> Two or three sides<br> of an exercise book.<br> But I can't find a title.<br> Oh, well, we'll think of something.<br> See if it's still in my jacket.<br> And my reading glasses.<br> I thought I had written today.<br> No, well, you'll not see<br> much through those.<br> Well, look for me.<br> Is there anything?<br> Evidently not.<br> It cannot be Lear again.<br> Shall we start our make-up?<br> I'm getting out of here.<br> I'm not staying in this place<br> a moment longer.<br> I am surrounded by vipers,<br> betrayal on every side.<br> I am being crushed, the lifeblood<br> is draining out of me.<br> The load is too much.<br> Norman, Norman, if you have any<br> regard for me, don't listen to him.<br> Who? Who? More, more, more,<br> I cannot give any more.<br> I have nothing more to give.<br> I want a tranquil senility.<br> I'm an old man.<br> I don't want to go on painting<br> my face night after night<br> after night, dressing up in clothes<br> that are not my own,<br> I'm not a child dressing<br> up for charades.<br> This is my work, this is<br> my life's work, I'm an actor.<br> Who cares if I go out there tonight<br> or any other night<br> and shorten my life?<br> Shorten my life...<br> I don't care if there's only<br> three people out front,<br> or if the audience laughs<br> when they shouldn't, or don't<br> when they should, one person, just<br> one person will know and understand.<br> And I act for him.<br> I cannot move that which<br> cannot be moved.<br> What are we on about now?<br> I'm filled inside with stone.<br> Stone upon stone.<br> I cannot lift myself.<br> The weight is too much.<br> Oh, I know futility when I see it.<br> I dream at night of unseen hands<br> driving wooden stakes into my feet.<br> And the dream is long and graceless.<br> I awake, sweat-drenched, poisoned.<br> And the whole day long there is<br> a burning heat inside of me,<br> driving all else from my mind.<br> HE GRUNTS<br> What did I do today?<br> You walked. You thought you wrote.<br> You went into Market Square.<br> And a woman kissed your hand<br> and said you were lovely<br> in The Corsican Brothers.<br> How do you know all this?<br> Has someone been talking?<br> I don't wish to hurry you, Sir.<br> No, I lie, I do.<br> I hate the swines. Who?<br> He's a hard task-master,<br> he drives me too hard.<br> I have too much to carry.<br> (Yes?)<br> I'd like to see him.<br> (I'd rather you didn't.)<br> It's my responsibility to take<br> the curtain up tonight.<br> There isn't much time.<br> (Things have reached<br> a delicate stage.)<br> What's all the whispering?<br> Nothing, nothing.<br> Has he begun to make-up yet? Not<br> yet. Do you realise how late it is?<br> They'll be calling<br> the half in a moment.<br> I know how late it is.<br> SIR HUMS A TUNE LOUDLY<br> Then on your head be it.<br> Oh, look! A dressing-gown!<br> Shall we put it on<br> and keep ourselves warm?<br> What does it matter where you were<br> or what you did today?<br> You're here in the theatre,<br> safe and sound, where you belong.<br> Another full house. Lovely.<br> Really? A full house?<br> They'll be standing in the gods.<br> Do you know they bombed<br> The Grand Theatre, Plymouth?<br> And much else of the city besides.<br> I made my debut<br> at The Grand Theatre, Plymouth.<br> They weren't to know.<br> I shouldn't have come out this<br> autumn but I had no choice.<br> He made me. Who?<br> I should have rested.<br> I had a friend that was<br> ordered to rest.<br> He obeyed<br> and that was the end of him.<br> He was ever so ill.<br> Nearly became a Catholic.<br> Right, now, would you like<br> a little rub-down?<br> I'm not surprised<br> you're feeling dispirited.<br> It's been ever such a hard time.<br> No young men to play juveniles and<br> the trouble with Mr Davenport-Scott.<br> What news of Mr Davenport-Scott?<br> The police have opposed bail. What?<br> Well, he'd had his second warning.<br> How then do we dispose our forces?<br> Mr Thornton is standing by<br> to play Fool.<br> And who as Oswald?<br> Mr Brown, I'm afraid.<br> That leaves me a knight short for<br> "reason not the need".<br> 98 short, actually,<br> if you take the text as gospel.<br> One more or less won't seem<br> too upsetting.<br> Herr Hitler has made it<br> very difficult<br> for Shakespearean companies.<br> It'll be a chapter in the book, Sir.<br> I hate to mention it but we're going<br> to be short for the storm.<br> We've no-one to operate<br> the wind machine,<br> not if Mr Thornton is to play Fool.<br> Mr Thornton was ever<br> so good on the wind machine.<br> Madge knows the problem<br> but she's very unsympathetic.<br> You tell Madge from me I must<br> have the storm at full strength.<br> What about Oxenby?<br> Not the most amenable of gentlemen.<br> Send him to me at the half.<br> I'll have a word with him.<br> Better talk to Thornton, too.<br> There you are, you see?<br> That's more like it.<br> You're where you belong,<br> doing what you know best,<br> and you're yourself again.<br> Right, well, you start<br> doing your make-up and I'll go<br> and tell them to come and see you.<br> I've cleaned the wig and beard.<br> Shan't be a minute.<br> Oh, no, Sir! Not Othello!<br> The lines are fouled.<br> Up on your short, down on your long.<br> Is there a dead for it?<br> Instruct the puppeteer to<br> renew the strings.<br> The stuffing is<br> escaping at the seams,<br> straw from a scarecrow lies<br> scattered down, stage left.<br> I would have given anything to see<br> the play tonight.<br> There's you all blacked up<br> and Cordelia saying,<br> "You beget me, bred me, loved me. "<br> Well, the time has come,<br> if you don't mind my saying so,<br> to stop waxing poetical<br> and to wax a bit more practical.<br> KNOCKI NG<br> Who?<br> Irene.<br> I've come for the triple crown.<br> Enter.<br> Good evening, Sir.<br> All well? Yes, thank you, Sir.<br> You've come for the triple crown.<br> Yes, Sir.<br> Polish it well. I like it gleaming.<br> Yes, Sir.<br> And return it to me<br> well before curtain up.<br> I like to wear it by the quarter.<br> Yes, Sir.<br> And when I have used it on stage,<br> see that it is returned to my room<br> after the interval.<br> She has done it before, Sir.<br> I like to be certain.<br> There it is, my child.<br> Pretty young thing, aren't you?<br> Thank you, Sir.<br> Sir, it's time to age.<br> They're all the same colour.<br> Which stick do I use?<br> I can't see the colours.<br> What now? How is he?<br> He'll be all right<br> if he's left in peace.<br> I want to see with my own eyes.<br> No, no, he is not to be disturbed.<br> And what about the understudies?<br> He knows all about it,<br> everything's in hand.<br> You realise now there's going to be<br> an audience out there.<br> It'd be a bit silly going through<br> all this if there wasn't.<br> Will he be ready on time?<br> Will he be well enough? Yes.<br> Madge, can I just, erm...?<br> Who was that?<br> Just a minion minioning.<br> Too many interruptions,<br> my concentration.<br> Norman. Yes, Sir?<br> How does the play begin?<br> Which play, Sir?<br> Tonight's, tonight's,<br> I cannot remember the first line.<br> "Attend the lords of France<br> and Burgundy, Gloucester. "<br> Yes, yes.<br> What performance is this?<br> Tonight will be your...<br> 227th performance of the part, Sir.<br> 227 Lears and I cannot remember<br> the first line.<br> Haven't we forgotten<br> something else, Sir?<br> If you don't mind my asking.<br> We have to sink our cheeks.<br> I shall look like this in my coffin.<br> And a broad straight line<br> of number 20 down the nose.<br> 'Give you strength, you say. '<br> 'Surgical spirit. '<br> 'I know how to stick on a beard.<br> 'I've been a depicter for 50 years. '<br> 'I shall need a rest after<br> the storm scenes. '<br> 'There's no need to tell me.<br> I know. '<br> 'And shall we take extra care with<br> the wig join tonight?'<br> 'I shall give them<br> a good one tonight. '<br> Norman! Yes, Sir?<br> What's the first line again? All this<br> clitter-clatter-chitter-chatter...<br> "Attend the lords of France<br> and Burgundy, Gloucester. "<br> You've put it out of my mind.<br> Keep silent when I'm dressing.<br> I have work to do,<br> hard bloody labour.<br> Sir, Sir. I cannot remember<br> the first line. 100,000 performances<br> and I have to ask you<br> for the first line.<br> Yes, I'll take you through it.<br> Take me through it?<br> Nobody takes you through it,<br> you're put through it,<br> night after night after night.<br> I haven't the strength.<br> And you're a fine one.<br> I must say, you of all people,<br> you disappoint me,<br> if you don't mind my saying so.<br> You, who always say that self-pity<br> is the most unattractive<br> quality on stage or off.<br> Who have you been working for<br> all these years?<br> The Ministry of Information?<br> Struggle and survival, you say,<br> that's all that matters.<br> The whole world's struggling for<br> bloody survival, so why can't you?<br> My dear Norman, I seem to have<br> upset you. I'm sorry.<br> I understand.<br> We cannot always be strong.<br> There is danger in<br> covering the cracks.<br> Never mind about<br> covering the cracks,<br> what about covering the wig join?<br> KNOCKING<br> Half an hour, please, Sir. Already?<br> You were in late this evening, Sir.<br> She hasn't returned with<br> the triple crown.<br> I like it on my head by now.<br> Look! What?<br> My hands, they're shaking.<br> Well, they'll be very<br> effective in the part.<br> Don't forget to make them up.<br> I can't stop them. You do it.<br> Oh, oh, look here.<br> Look here, it must be infectious.<br> I can face the division<br> of my kingdom.<br> I can cope with Fool.<br> I can bear the reduction<br> of my retinue.<br> I can stomach the curses<br> I have to utter.<br> I can even face being<br> whipped by the storm.<br> But I dread the final entrance.<br> To carry my Cordelia...<br> dead, dead.<br> To cry like the wind,<br> howl, howl, howl.<br> To lay her gently on the ground,<br> to die.<br> Have I the strength?<br> If you haven't the strength,<br> no-one has.<br> You're a good friend, Norman.<br> Thank you, Sir.<br> You shall be rewarded.<br> Pardon me while I get my violin.<br> Do not mock me. I may not have long.<br> My father used to say that.<br> He lived till he was 93.<br> He may still be alive,<br> for all I know.<br> Bonzo, how do you feel?<br> A little more myself, Pussy.<br> You see? Once he's assumed<br> the disguise, he's a different man.<br> "Egad, Madam,<br> thou hast a porcupine wit. "<br> And are you sure you're<br> able to go on?<br> On and on and on.<br> Pussy, I thought<br> it was the black one tonight.<br> My dear.<br> Did I wake in the night, Pussy?<br> Did I thank you<br> for watching over me?<br> Was there talk of violence?<br> No, Bonzo, you dreamt it.<br> I still have the feeling.<br> Would you like me to fetch the<br> cloak and tie it on as usual?<br> Yes, as usual.<br> Oh, erm, Mr Thornton and Mr Oxenby<br> are waiting outside to see you.<br> Would you like me<br> to ask them to come in?<br> I don't want to see Oxenby.<br> He frightens me.<br> Mind you, he was the best<br> lago I've ever had or seen<br> and I include that 4'6"<br> ponce Sir Arthur Palgrove.<br> That's more like the Sir<br> we know and love.<br> He went on playing Hamlet<br> till he was 68.<br> There were more lines on his face<br> than steps to the gallery.<br> I saw his Lear. I was pleasantly<br> disappointed. Sir Arthur Palgrove.<br> Who advises His Majesty,<br> answer me that?<br> You're a miracle-worker, Norman.<br> Thank you, Your Ladyship.<br> (Here's a piece of chocolate<br> for you.)<br> (Oh, thank you, Your Ladyship.)<br> It'll be all hands to the pump<br> tonight, Norman.<br> A small part of the service,<br> Your Ladyship. Thank you.<br> Don't suppose I didn't see that<br> because I did.<br> There are more children in this<br> beloved land of ours scavenging<br> the larders for something sweet,<br> if only they came to me<br> I could tell them of<br> the one person in England who has an<br> inexhaustible supply of chocolate.<br> Because it is I who have to carry<br> her dead as my Cordelia.<br> It is I who have to lift her<br> up in my arms.<br> Thank Christ, I thought,<br> for rationing<br> but, no, she would find sugar<br> in a sand dune.<br> Shall I show the actors in, Sir?<br> What? No, I don't want...<br> Sir, you have to see the actors.<br> Ah, Mr Thorton. Mr Thornton<br> to see you, Sir.<br> SIR GARGLES<br> Geoffrey, does the costume fit?<br> Mr Davenport-Scott was<br> such a tall man.<br> Mr Davenport-Scott was a worm.<br> You look, er...<br> Do you know the lines? Yes.<br> Don't keep me waiting for them.<br> Oh, no.<br> Pace, pace, pace, pace, pace, pace.<br> Yes. And keep out of my focus. Yes.<br> The boom lights placed<br> in the downstage wings<br> are for me and me only.<br> Yes, old man, I know.<br> You must find what light you can.<br> Right.<br> Let me hear you sing. What?<br> "For he that has the little<br> tiny wit. Heigh-ho... "<br> WHIMPERING: He... he...<br> # He that has the little<br> tiny wit... #<br> HE WHIMPERS<br> # He that has and a little tiny wit<br> # With a heigh-ho,<br> the wind and the rain<br> # Must make content with<br> fortunes fit<br> # For the rain it raineth<br> every day. #<br> All right, speak it, don't sing it.<br> And in the storm scene, if you<br> are going to put your arms around<br> my legs, as Mr Davenport-Scott did,<br> then around my calves, not my thighs.<br> He almost ruptured me twice.<br> I'd rather I didn't, old man.<br> Feel it, my boy, feel it,<br> it is the only way.<br> Whatever takes you. Right.<br> But do not let it take you too much.<br> Remain within the bounds.<br> And, at all costs, remain still<br> when I speak. Of course.<br> Serve the playwright...<br> and keep your teeth in.<br> It's only when I'm nervous.<br> You will be nervous, I guarantee it.<br> There will be no extra<br> payment for this performance.<br> I believe your contract is<br> play as cast. Yes.<br> Good fortune attend your endeavours.<br> Thank you, Sir.<br> (God bless, Geoffrey.)<br> (I'd rather face<br> the Nazi hordes any day.)<br> I hope Mr Churchill has better<br> men in the cabinet.<br> Mr Oxenby is waiting, Sir. Oxenby?<br> What... what...? I don't know.<br> What does Oxenby want?<br> It's not what he wants,<br> it's what we want - someone to<br> operate the wind machine.<br> I don't want to see Oxenby,<br> I can't bear the man,<br> it's stifling in here.<br> We'll have no storm without him.<br> Mr Oxenby to see you, Sir.<br> You wanted to see me?<br> I... I don't know, erm, why?<br> Er, Norman?<br> Sir was wondering<br> if he could ask of you a favour.<br> He can ask.<br> You've not been with us very long<br> but I'm sure you've seen<br> enough to know that we're not<br> so much a company as one great<br> big happy family.<br> And...<br> we all muck in as required.<br> As I'm sure you've heard,<br> Mr Davenport-Scott will not be<br> rejoining the company.<br> Yes, I've heard.<br> You share a dressing-room<br> with one or two of them,<br> you hear nothing else.<br> It upsets the pansy fraternity<br> when one of their number is caught.<br> Because Mr Thornton is having<br> to play Fool,<br> and because our two elderly knights<br> are setting the hovel behind<br> the cloth during the storm scene,<br> we've no-one to operate<br> the wind machine.<br> We'd ask Mr Brown<br> but he's really rather too fragile.<br> We were wondering<br> if you'd turn the handle.<br> In short, no.<br> Anything else?<br> Has he read my play yet?<br> Perhaps the Russians have had<br> a setback on the Eastern Front.<br> Bolshevism will be<br> the ruin of the theatre.<br> What are we going to do?<br> Fancy not wanting to muck in.<br> He hates me. I can feel his hatred.<br> All I stand for he despises.<br> I wouldn't read his play, even if<br> he were Commissar of Culture.<br> I've read it.<br> Is there a part for me? Yes.<br> I know what Oxenby's up to.<br> He's writing plays for critics,<br> not people.<br> Oughtn't we to be quiet<br> for a bit, Sir?<br> Where's the girl with<br> the triple crown?<br> Don't fuss. I'll go and find her.<br> Oh, my dear.<br> Norman's just gone to find you.<br> Has he? I must have missed him.<br> Remind me of your name, child.<br> It's Irene, Sir.<br> Irene. Charming.<br> Were you at the Rada?<br> No, sir. I went straight into Rep.<br> Of course. I remember. Which Rep?<br> Maidenhead. Maidenhead, yes.<br> Next week in Eastbourne.<br> KNOCKING<br> I can't find her.<br> Just admiring her bone structure.<br> Run along, Irene. Run along.<br> BELL RINGS<br> A born actress.<br> Can tell by the cheek bones.<br> Put the crown on.<br> It's almost the quarter.<br> Shall I fetch her ladyship<br> and ask her to tie on the cloak?<br> How does the play begin?<br> God help me, that child has<br> driven it from my mind.<br> KNOCKING<br> Quarter of an hour, please,<br> a few minutes late, I'm sorry,<br> that girl Irene is going to be<br> the death of me.<br> The quarter, I can't, I'm not ready,<br> tell them to go home,<br> give them their money back.<br> I hate the swines, I can't, I can't.<br> What are you saying?

Told you.<br> Sweet as Winston Churchill.<br> I can't have you pissed.<br> DOOR OPENS<br> You not dressed yet?<br> I'm a little slow tonight,<br> Pussy.<br> I'm not waiting.<br> I'll go back to the digs,<br> and see if I can get a fire lit.<br> I won't be long.<br> Goodnight, Norman... I'm not sure<br> whether I should thank you or not.<br> Not. I can't bear to be thanked.<br> Goodnight.<br> She's a good woman.<br> Good woman.<br> BANGING ON DOOR<br> Who? Mr Oxenby.<br> HE SOBS<br> What do you want? My manuscript.<br> He won't read it, I know that.<br> Keep your voice down! He's not gone<br> yet. Just wait there.<br> He's a little slow tonight.<br> All that struggling and surviving<br> has tired him, no doubt.<br> Please, Mr Oxenby.<br> Outmoded hypocrite.<br> Tell him from me, I look forward<br> to a new order.<br> I want a company without tyrants.<br> Who'd be in charge?<br> I would.<br> You'll be lovely with a bit success,<br> Mr Oxenby.<br> Your nose is browner than usual<br> tonight, Norman.<br> Goodnight, Sir.<br> If you hurry,<br> you'll catch Mr Oxenby.<br> HE GROANS<br> Sir? AGH!<br> Oh, good God! I am tired. Terribly<br> tired. The room is spinning.<br> I must lie down.<br> See if you can get me a taxi<br> in this godforsaken place.<br> All in good time.<br> Oh, don't cry. Now, don't cry.<br> There's nothing left.<br> Stop that at once.<br> I had a friend...<br> Oh, for Christ's sake,<br> I'm sick of your friends!<br> The motley crew they are.<br> Pathetic, lonely, despairing...<br> That's nice, isn't it(?)<br> I beg your pardon. Uncalled for.<br> Think of me as your friend.<br> Never despairing.<br> Have apologised.<br> Never, never despairing.<br> Well, perhaps sometimes. At night.<br> Or at Christmas,<br> when you can't get a job in a panto.<br> But never once inside the building.<br> Never.<br> Pathetic maybe, but not ungrateful.<br> Too mindful of one's luck,<br> as the saying goes.<br> No duke is more privileged. Here's<br> beauty, here's spring and summer.<br> Here pain is bearable.<br> And never lonely. Not here.<br> For he that sheds his blood today<br> with me. Soft, no doubt.<br> Sensitive - that's my nature.<br> Easily hurt, but that's a virtue.<br> And I'm not here<br> for any reasons of my own either.<br> No-one could accuse me<br> of base motives.<br> I have got what I want<br> and I don't need anyone to know it.<br> Inadequate, yes.<br> But never, never despairing.<br> I've begun My Life.<br> Fetch it. The book.<br> I made a start...<br> You didn't get very far...<br> What did I write?<br> "My Life. Dedication.<br> "This book is dedicated<br> to my beloved Pussy,<br> "who has been my splendid spur.<br> "To the spirit of all actors<br> because of their faith<br> "and endurance<br> which never fails them.<br> "To those who do<br> the work of the theatre yet have<br> "but small share in the glory.<br> "The carpenters, electricians,<br> scene-shifters, property men.<br> "To the audiences, who have laughed<br> with us, have wept with us<br> "and whose hearts have united<br> with ours<br> "in sympathy and understanding. "<br> "But finally... "<br> ah, Sir,<br> "to the memory<br> of William Shakespeare...<br> ".. in whose glorious service<br> we all labour. "<br> My Life will have to do.<br> Wait a moment, wait a moment...<br> "The carpenters, electricians,<br> scene-shifters... "<br> Sir?<br> Sir...<br> Sir?<br> Sir...<br> We're not dead, are we?<br> That's your cue.<br> You know the line.<br> "You lie! Jack Clinton... "<br> "lives!"<br> Talk about untoward.<br> Ooh... You're right.<br> The room is spinning.<br> Your Ladyship!<br> MADGE!<br> Anybody!<br> FOOTSTEPS APPROACH<br> Wasn't much of a death scene.<br> Unremarkable.<br> And ever so short.<br> For him.<br> Where's Her Ladyship?<br> They all left before he did.<br> Couldn't wait.<br> I'll telephone her.<br> And I'll get a doctor.<br> Too late for a doctor, ducky.<br> What's going to happen to me?<br> Close the door. Wait outside.<br> I don't want to wait outside.<br> I NEVER wait outside.<br> I want to be with HIM.<br> I know my place, ducky.<br> Try and sober up.<br> Ambulance, please.<br> "Carpenters, electricians,<br> property men"? You cruel bastard.<br> You might have remembered.<br> Yes, Your Ladyship, it's Madge.<br> I was wondering if you could come<br> to the theatre.<br> MADGE HANGS UP PHONE<br> FOOTSTEPS APPROACH<br> Her Ladyship's coming at once.<br> She took it very calmly.<br> She asked for him<br> to be covered in his Lear cloak.<br> Covered in his Lear cloak?<br> Ooh! Fetch the photographers, ducky.<br> Covered in his Lear cloak?<br> This isn't the Death of Nelson,<br> you know.<br> Where is it?<br> There's no mention<br> of stage managers either.<br> Come out of here.<br> Are we going to get paid?<br> I mean, is there money in the till<br> after deductions for income tax?<br> We've got to be paid<br> for the full week, you know.<br> Just because a man dies<br> on Thursday doesn't mean to say<br> we get paid pro rata.<br> Come away.<br> Where will I go?<br> Where?<br> I'm nowhere... out of my element.<br> I don't want to end up running<br> a boarding house in Colwyn Bay.<br> What am I going to do?<br> You can speak well of him.<br> Speak well of THAT old sod?<br> I wouldn't give him a good<br> character, not in a court of law.<br> The ungrateful bastard.<br> Get out. Get out!<br> I don't want you in here.<br> Holy, holy, holy, is it?<br> This isn't a shrine!<br> No pissing on the altar.<br> Stop it.<br> Speak well of him?<br> I know what YOU'D say.<br> I know all about YOU, ducky.<br> I have eyes in my head.<br> We all have our little sorrows.<br> I know what you'd say - stiff upper,<br> faithful, loyal, loving.<br> Well, I have only one thing to say<br> about him<br> and I wouldn't say it in front<br> of you, or Her Ladyship, or anyone.<br> Lips tight shut. I wouldn't give you<br> the pleasure. Or him.<br> Especially not him.<br> If I said what I have to say, he'd<br> find a way to take it out on me.<br> No-one will ever know.<br> We all have our little sorrows,<br> ducky...<br> You're not the only one.<br> The littler you are,<br> the larger your sorrows.<br> You think you loved him?<br> What about me?<br> Oh, this is no place for death.<br> I had a friend...<br>
