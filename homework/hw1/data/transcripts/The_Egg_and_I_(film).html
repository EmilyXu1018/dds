                        - Whoops!<br> Now look what you've done.<br> No harm done, ma'am.<br> It's only an egg.<br> - Only an egg?<br> - Yes, ma'am. Just a little old egg.<br> I suppose it never occurred to you<br> that this egg is somebody's child.<br> - That it once had a mother.<br> - No, ma'am.<br> - And a father.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> You're one of those people who thinks<br> a chicken lays an egg all by herself.<br> - Yes, ma'am!<br> - Well, she doesn't. She lays it with help.<br> - And I ought to know because I helped her.<br> - Yes, indeed, ma'am!<br> Telling me about eggs.<br> And I'll bet you think an egg is something<br> you casually order for breakfast...<br> when you can't think<br> of anything else.<br> Well, so did I once.<br> But that was before The Egg And I.<br> # This is the day<br> they give babies away #<br> # With a half a pound of tea #<br> # You open the lid and out pops a kid<br> with a half a pound of tea #<br> - Betty?<br> - Hmm?<br> - Remember once we talked about<br> maybe having a farm someday? - Uh-huh.<br> - Have you thought about it since?<br> - Uh-uh.<br> I have. Betty, you ever think how we're<br> going to spend the rest of our lives?<br> Whatever my husband chooses<br> to do, it's all right with me.<br> The question is, are we going to trod the old<br> paths or break new roads into the wilderness?<br> I don't know.<br> Which?<br> You know, Betty, when you're<br> lying in a foxhole in Okinawa...<br> you got plenty of time<br> to think things out.<br> You know what I said to myself?<br> I said, "Just exactly what...<br> have Saddle, Finch, Tanner, Pease<br> and Stuck to do with all this?"<br> - You know what the answer was?<br> - Uh-uh.<br> Nothing, absolutely nothing. That's why I'm<br> not going back to be a mere customer's man...<br> - at Saddle, Finch, Tanner, Pease and Stuck.<br> - Aren't you?<br> I am not. I resigned yesterday. Hang<br> Saddle, Finch, Tanner, Pease and Stuck.<br> Well, you'll find<br> something else I'm sure.<br> - We'll talk about it in the morning, hmm?<br> - Do you know what a fellow...<br> thinks about when he's<br> lying out there in the mud...<br> - with the shells bursting all around him?<br> - I'd think about you.<br> He thinks about the fundamental things.<br> The things that really count.<br> The basic things.<br> Love, food, babies.<br> Things growing out of the ground.<br> He thinks about cows, horses...<br> Do you know what I dreamt<br> about most, Betty?<br> - Tell me, darling.<br> - About chickens.<br> - Chickens?<br> - Can't you just picture it, Betty?<br> Just you and me all by ourselves with<br> thousands and thousands of chickens.<br> Everyone of them<br> laying eggs all day long.<br> - What would we do with that many eggs?<br> - We'd sell them!<br> - Those we don't keep for incubating.<br> - Incubating?<br> - Darling, I bought a chicken farm.<br> - A chicken farm?<br> It's the most wonderful place<br> you can possibly imagine.<br> It's situated high up in the mountains.<br> Miles from everywhere, 40 beautiful acres.<br> That sounds fine.<br> We'll go there every weekend.<br> Every weekend? Honey, we're gonna live there<br> all the time! We're gonna raise chickens.<br> - Are we?<br> - You bet we are.<br> You have no idea what a fascinating<br> little devil a chicken can be.<br> There must be over 100 varieties.<br> Australorps, Dorkings.<br> Leghorns...<br> twelve different kinds of them.<br> The New Hampshire Red,<br> the Rhode Island Red.<br> The Light Brahma, the Black Sumatra,<br> theJersey White Giant.<br> The Plymouth Rock, the Barbrock.<br> There are millions of them.<br> Take the average White Leghorn<br> that lays 150 to 250 eggs a year.<br> - We'll say she costs between<br> $2.25 and $2.50 to raise...<br> They all right back there?<br> Oh, they're fine.<br> They love it.<br> Of course, our profit will vary...<br> The percentage of cockerels is a vital<br> factor in determining the cost of each pullet.<br> You've got to keep watching for those<br> little combs to break out of the shells.<br> Then you separate 'em, fatten 'em up,<br> dress 'em and off to market they go.<br> Oh, my hat! Oh, Bob, stop!<br> Can't stop here.<br> We'll get it later.<br> He's eating it!<br> Don't worry.<br> It won't hurt him.<br> - How much longer?<br> - Pretty soon now.<br> - Beautiful country, isn't it?<br> - Mmm.<br> - Seems so far away.<br> - Far away from what?<br> I don't know.<br> Just far away.<br> - Get ready, Betty.<br> - Are we there?<br> In a minute. Close your eyes.<br> I want to surprise you with it.<br> - They were closed.<br> - Close them again.<br> All right, open 'em.<br> - Where's the house?<br> - That's it right there.<br> Oh.<br> Needs a new coat of paint.<br> The agent told me there wasn't another<br> house like it in the whole county.<br> Come on,<br> I'll show it to you.<br> Isn't this the most beautiful setting<br> for a house you ever saw?<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> How do you like this view<br> from the front porch?<br> Well, honey, this is it.<br> Over the threshold.<br> - Oh!<br> - Hang on.<br> - Darling, you'd better put me down.<br> - Yeah, I...<br> It's stuck.<br> I'll have to force it.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yeah, I'm all right.<br> - Those hinges must have loosened up.<br> - Oh.<br> I'll fix that. Well, honey,<br> what do you think?<br> Hasn't it got a lot of character?<br> That stairway goes up to the attic.<br> This is the bedroom.<br> This is the living room.<br> Nice size room,<br> isn't it?<br> - Good floors. Won't have<br> to do a thing to 'em.<br> Just scrub 'em<br> and polish 'em.<br> Here's the dining room.<br> They don't build houses<br> like this nowadays.<br> This table isn't bad, is it?<br> Solid oak.<br> Don't care much for<br> that fixture though, do you?<br> Wait'll you see the kitchen. Isn't this<br> something? An old-fashioned kitchen.<br> Haven't seen one like this since I was a kid.<br> None of that streamlined stuff.<br> This is the kind of place where you can<br> really get down to living.<br> No running water, no Frigidaire.<br> Just plenty of elbow room.<br> Here's the back porch<br> out here.<br> Go on, take a look. That's<br> the chicken house over there.<br> Of course, we'll have<br> to make it bigger.<br> Those woods back there<br> belong to us too.<br> Isn't that some barn?<br> That's the pigpen in front of it.<br> Compact little layout, isn't it?<br> It needs a little sprucing up.<br> Some paint, some patches. We'll get<br> started on that in the morning.<br> Come on, I'll show you<br> the rest of the house.<br> You haven't seen anything yet. It keeps<br> getting better and better. Here's the pantry.<br> These steps go to the cellar<br> where we can store vegetables...<br> and all those canned goods<br> you're going to put up.<br> What's that?<br> Huh? Oh!<br> Isn't that a beauty?<br> I bet you've never seen a stove<br> like that in all your life.<br> Just aching for a big side of beef<br> or a pot full of soup...<br> or couple of<br> dozen loaves of bread.<br> Fresh bread.<br> I can smell it already.<br> You're going to have<br> a wonderful time with that stove.<br> You can get to the bedroom<br> right through the kitchen here.<br> I don't think it likes me.<br> - Betty?<br> - Coming.<br> You and I, my friend, are not<br> going to get along at all.<br> - Bob...<br> - How do you like this bed?<br> - Isn't it a wonderful old piece?<br> - Hmm.<br> It needs a little<br> propping up.<br> There, that ought to do it.<br> Kind of noisy,<br> don't you think?<br> - Isn't this the life, Betty?<br> - I guess so.<br> Once you get used to it.<br> - It's raining.<br> - Right through the roof.<br> Gesundheit.<br> There, we'll be<br> all right here.<br> I'll have to get up on that roof. Some<br> of the shingles must have loosened up.<br> You catching cold? You must have<br> been sitting in a draught.<br> - Ah, I must have.<br> - You better get in bed.<br> Ah, just smell that. Wonderful to fill<br> your lungs with clean air for a change.<br> Well, the first night<br> in our own home.<br> Doesn't it feel great, Betty?<br> Gonna make it a real home too.<br> Something to be proud of.<br> None of that hit-and-run stuff for us.<br> Just think, Betty,<br> this is where we'll...<br> probably spend<br> the rest of our lives.<br> - Doesn't it give you<br> a wonderful sense of security?<br> Now, then, everything's<br> gotta be scheduled.<br> Can't leave anything to chance.<br> Farming's a big enough gamble as it is.<br> Now by June we should have<br> at least a half-dozen sucklings.<br> We'll have a calf in July.<br> Then, along about August, we can begin<br> to figure on more important offspring.<br> - Oh, darling.<br> - Maybe 500 or 600 of them.<br> - 500, 600 what?<br> - Chicks, of course.<br> Maybe even more<br> if we're lucky.<br> I'd like to raise something<br> besides chickens, you know.<br> Oh, we'll have plenty of those too.<br> I'm counting on at least four.<br> Maybe even five.<br> Three boys and two girls, huh?<br> - All at once?<br> - Oh, no, one at a time.<br> Let's schedule the first one<br> for, uh, a year from today.<br> - How's that?<br> - That looks like a good day for it.<br> ## Betty?<br> Betty?<br> Hmm?<br> Hey, Betty?<br> Wake up. Didn't you<br> hear the alarm clock?<br> You gonna lie there in bed forever?<br> Come on, get out.<br> - I've got breakfast almost ready.<br> - Hmm?<br> It's still night out.<br> What do you mean "night"?<br> It's 4:30. Half the morning's gone.<br> I let you loll in bed<br> because it's the first day...<br> but from now on you've got to be<br> up every morning at 4:00 sharp.<br> - Hey, Betty?<br> - Hmm?<br> Come on, get out of there!<br> Got a lot of work to do.<br> Betty!<br> Bob!<br> How are those nails,<br> Betty?<br> - Oh! Bob!<br> - Yeah?<br> Hey, Betty?<br> Hey, Betty,<br> what are you doing down there?<br> Oh!<br> Just dropped in<br> to say howdy.<br> - Howdy.<br> - Howdy.<br> Ma told me to come by and ask you<br> over for a visit when you got time.<br> We're your neighbours<br> just down the road a spell.<br> Kettle's the name.<br> Folks call me Pa.<br> - I'm glad to know ya, Pa.<br> - Likewise.<br> - Hello!<br> - Hi.<br> This is my husband.<br> Meet Pa Kettle, Bob.<br> - Just dropped in to say howdy.<br> - Well, uh, howdy.<br> Howdy. Thought I'd tell ya<br> long as we're neighbours...<br> you can count on us for<br> anything you might be needin'.<br> Just step in and ask for it.<br> Be glad to lend a helpin' hand.<br> Thanks, Mr Kettle.<br> That's very nice of you.<br> - Building somethin'?<br> - Yes, we're putting up a new chicken coop.<br> Wouldn't mind having<br> a few of them two-by-fours.<br> Been fixin' my barn. Ain't<br> had no time to get to town.<br> - Go ahead. Help yourself.<br> - That's real neighbourly of you.<br> Won't be needin'<br> more than two... or so.<br> - Give me a holt here, will ya?<br> - You bet.<br> Oh, uh, two more...<br> just in case.<br> Oh, uh, better have<br> another one for good measure.<br> - Sure you got enough?<br> - Well, maybe one more for the house.<br> - Huh?<br> - I'll take 'em.<br> I'm gonna need a couple of pounds of nails.<br> Ain't got none to fit a two-by-four.<br> I guess I can let you<br> have a couple of pounds.<br> And an extra hammer and a saw. Kids<br> been usin' my saw and ruined the edge.<br> - Couldn't cut butter with it now.<br> - I'll give you a hammer and saw.<br> - I have to have them back.<br> - Send it back as soon as I'm through.<br> Come around the barn.<br> I'll see what I can dig up.<br> Say, you'll have to paint the place,<br> won't ya?<br> - Have you got any paint?<br> - Come to think of it, I ain't.<br> - Got any red you could spare?<br> - No, we've only got green.<br> Green will do.<br> I ain't particular.<br> Gee-up, there.<br> There! I'll bet you've never looked as good<br> as this in your whole life.<br> Oh! Oh, you!<br> Indians! Bob!<br> Bob! Bob!<br> Indians!<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - There, by the porch!<br> - That's Geoduck and Crowbar.<br> - Who?<br> - Geoduck and Crowbar. They sell fish.<br> - Fish?<br> You've been seeing too many<br> Westerns. Hiya, fellas.<br> - How!<br> - Betty, look at these crabs.<br> - Get a load of the size.<br> - Are we gonna raise them too?<br> We'll take a dozen. Just put 'em on<br> the back porch. Give a hand, will you, Tom?<br> - Say, who's Tom?<br> - He's Pa Kettle's boy. He's gonna work for us.<br> - Hope he doesn't take after his father.<br> - So far, he hasn't borrowed a thing.<br> I've been looking at the egg charts. Have<br> you been collecting the eggs regularly?<br> - Well, not exactly. They won't let me.<br> - They won't let you?<br> No, anyway it seems kind of cruel<br> to break up the family so early.<br> It's no joke. Those eggs have to be<br> collected regularly.<br> Couldn't I do<br> something else instead?<br> There's nothing difficult about it.<br> A child can do it.<br> - They look at me so hurt. I haven't got the heart.<br> - That's ridiculous.<br> Here I'll show you.<br> They don't act like that<br> when I do it.<br> Let's see you do it.<br> There! Now you see?<br> - That's funny.<br> - They don't like me.<br> Maybe you have the wrong attitude.<br> Chickens sense things in people.<br> Frankly, I think they're<br> stuck on you and resent me.<br> Maybe I better collect the eggs.<br> You do something else.<br> - Have you fed Cleopatra?<br> - No, I was just going to.<br> - She'll never get fat if you don't feed her.<br> - She's as fat as a pig now.<br> Okay, toots,<br> come and get it.<br> No, you don't! You come right back here<br> this minute!<br> Cleopatra,<br> do you hear me?<br> You get right back in this pen before<br> I do something you'll be very sorry for.<br> Do you hear me?<br> All right,<br> you asked for it. Come on.<br> Come on now. Get back in here.<br> Do you hear... Oh!<br> Come back here.<br> Cleopatra!<br> Cleopatra, come back here!<br> Having any difficulty?<br> Maybe I can help.<br> Here, pig, pig, pig!<br> Come on, pig, pig, pig.<br> Piggy, piggy, piggy.<br> Here, pig.<br> Well, that's the idea.<br> You certainly have a way with pigs.<br> Hello. I'm Harriet Putnam,<br> Bella Vista Farm.<br> - Oh, you have the fancy place down the road.<br> - That's right.<br> - This is my wife, Betty. Come on, honey.<br> - We've met already.<br> You're going to have a lovely place here<br> once you get it fixed up.<br> - It has loads of possibilities.<br> - Still needs a lot of work.<br> - Mind if I look around?<br> - Not at all. I'll show you around.<br> We've only just started<br> to get it in shape.<br> It's going to be so nice having<br> real people around for a change.<br> You better get cleaned up. That isn't<br> exactly perfume you're covered with.<br> Oh!<br> - How charming we look today, madam.<br> - We look nothing of the sort.<br> - Who are you?<br> - Best friend the farmer's wife ever had. Smiling Billy Reed.<br> "Whatever you need,<br> see Billy Reed. " That's me.<br> Right now I don't need anything except<br> a bath. Will you get out of my way...<br> For the bath.

"<br> - Bath salts from the Isle of Capri.<br> - Some other time.<br> "Time," the lady says.<br> I got all the time in the world.<br> Alarm clocks, grandfather<br> clocks, wristwatches, pocket watches.<br> If it's time you need, see Billy Reed...<br> "If at first you don't succeed, try again,"<br> says Billy Reed.<br> - Please, I've got to change my clothes!<br> - "Clothes," the lady says.<br> Yes, I know. If it's clothes you need,<br> see Billy Reed.<br> I don't want any.<br> Now, will you go away?<br> You can turn me down<br> and send me away, but I'll be back...<br> another day!<br> Oh, isn't he nice? Is he ours?<br> Yeah, I bought him from Doc Wilson.<br> - Hi!<br> - He's a wonderful hunting dog, but he's vicious.<br> - Oh, he doesn't look...<br> - Don't touch him! He's bitten about everybody in town.<br> - Honest?<br> - Doc said he took a piece out of two postmen and three delivery boys.<br> I'll just tie him up front here<br> till I build a run for him.<br> - Don't want to get him<br> too near the livestock.<br> - What's his name?<br> - Sport.<br> - Hiya, Sport.<br> - Betty, don't touch him. I tell you he's dangerous.<br> Takes a steady nerve<br> to handle a dog like this.<br> - Better leave him to me<br> and stay away from him.<br> He looks<br> awfully sweet to me.<br> Women.<br> - What on Earth is that?<br> - Hello. I didn't hear you come in.<br> It's just a contraption I rigged up.<br> Kind of an automatic feeder.<br> The chicken pokes its head in there and<br> then the grain will just naturally pour out.<br> - I hope.<br> - Did you invent that?<br> There's a couple of things<br> I have to figure out.<br> - You're a regular Thomas Edison.<br> - Not quite.<br> I just like to tinker around<br> with machines and things.<br> - Better than farming?<br> - Oh, much.<br> Put 'er there.<br> I'll tell you something.<br> I like anything better than farming,<br> especially chicken farming.<br> - It's not much fun.<br> - It's no fun at all.<br> - You better let me.<br> - Oh, would you?<br> They don't care<br> very much about me.<br> - Shouldn't you be in school today?<br> - I finished school last year.<br> Oh, I see.<br> - What are you going to do now?<br> - Oh, I don't know.<br> - This or that, I guess. Doesn't make much difference.<br> - Doesn't it?<br> I sort of hoped I could go to college.<br> Study engineering or something.<br> But there's<br> not much chance of that.<br> - Why not?<br> - A lot of reasons.<br> For one, Ma needs somebody<br> around the place.<br> - You know how Pa is.<br> - Yes, I know how he is.<br> And, I'm the oldest, so...<br> Well, anyway...<br> - Here.<br> - Thanks.<br> Think I'll have a talk<br> with Ma one of these days.<br> Oh! Oh, no!<br> Well, well, well.<br> Well, hello,<br> Mr Vicious.<br> Bob's going to be awfully disappointed<br> when he comes home...<br> and finds out you haven't<br> torn me to pieces.<br> Did you want to show me<br> what a great retriever you are, huh?<br> Is that it? Come on.<br> Oh, you old fraud.<br> You don't even retrieve, do you?<br> Okay.<br> All right, we won't<br> tell Bob. No, we won't.<br> We'll just let him dream<br> a little while longer.<br> - Get in.<br> - Oh, I'm only going as far as the Kettles.<br> - I'll drop you. Get in.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm Mrs Hicks, the oldest family<br> in the county. That's my mother.<br> - How do you do? How are you?<br> - Fine, considering my condition.<br> - I'm so sorry. Aren't you feeling well?<br> - Never had a sick day.<br> - It's all in her mind.<br> - Don't you go saying that, Birdie. I've got complications.<br> Doctor Wilson says he never came across a<br> case like mine in his whole medical practice...<br> Pa Kettle been borrowing things<br> from ya already? Never get it back.<br> Lazy, shiftless crew, the whole lot of'em.<br> Disgrace to the community.<br> I went to the city last year and had<br> a wonderful going-over by a doctor there.<br> You the young couple took that abandoned<br> farm up the mountains a ways?<br> - It wasn't exactly abandoned. We bought it...<br> - He said to me...<br> "I don't ever remember seeing<br> a liver quite like yours. "<br> Nobody else wanted it. I call that<br> abandoned. Whatever you buy it for?<br> - He gave me the most wonderful pills.<br> - You'll never get it...<br> to look like anything,<br> too rundown.<br> I still got some. I'll send a few over to you<br> if there's anything the matter.<br> As for farming, be nothing short<br> of a miracle if you get anything to grow.<br> Better folks than you<br> have tried it and failed.<br> Eyesore to the community. I've tried<br> my best to get them run out of the county.<br> - Sure you want to stop off here?<br> - Positive.<br> You must come over sometime and let me tell<br> you all about the time I went to the hospital.<br> - Can't say you weren't warned.<br> - Thanks for the lift.<br> Give me mine! Give me it!<br> - Hello!<br> - Oh, hello. How are you?<br> Fine.<br> - Hello!<br> - Hi.<br> # Seesaw, seesaw,<br> Margery Daw, seesaw #<br> Where's your mother?<br> # Seesaw ##<br> Stop that dad-blasted noise!<br> Clear outta here!<br> Go on, you!<br> - Well, hello. Ain't this nice?<br> - How are you?<br> I was just wondering how long it'd be<br> before you got so lonesome you'd visit.<br> - Come on in the kitchen where we can talk a spell.<br> - Thank you.<br> Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!<br> Go! Go!<br> Get out of here.<br> My, my,<br> don't you look fine?<br> - Take a seat and make yourself to home.<br> - Thank you.<br> Just throw that stuff<br> anywhere.<br> How do you like your new place?<br> You don't look like a farmer.<br> I'm not, I'm afraid,<br> but I'm learning.<br> Nothin' like it, if it don't kill ya.<br> You're staying for dinner naturally.<br> - Oh, no, thank you.<br> - Oh, of course, you will.<br> Enough here for an army. Now, if you'll<br> just give me a hand settin' the table.<br> Oh, surely.<br> Tom was tellin' me what<br> real nice people you was.<br> We think a lot of him too.<br> He's a good boy, and he's so clever.<br> Ain't he, though? Not a mite like<br> the rest of the Kettles.<br> Makes me...<br> wonder sometimes.<br> - Seems a shame he had to leave school.<br> - Well, you know how it is.<br> We need Tom around the place.<br> Pa ain't much for workin' and...<br> - The rest of the young'uns<br> seem to take right after him.<br> Well... just the same<br> he ought to go to college.<br> College! What fer?<br> Oh, just so he can<br> make something of himself.<br> You wouldn't want to watch him<br> go to seed around here, would you?<br> Of course not.<br> Ain't for me to say.<br> If he had a little help, he could make out<br> all right at the State University.<br> There's no tuition<br> and he could work.<br> - He been talkin' to ya?<br> - He wants to go so badly.<br> Yes, I know he does.<br> I can see it in his eyes.<br> Tom got real high marks<br> when he was in high school.<br> - Ain't much I can do about it.<br> - Well, it's too bad.<br> Don't know as I could<br> get along without Tom.<br> We ain't got a live buck in the house<br> except what he brings in.<br> Last money I saved up, Pa put in a couple of<br> minks he was going to breed and make us a fortune.<br> Only they up and died before<br> they got around to breedin'.<br> Pa's kind of a dreamer<br> that way.<br> If you'll just get hold of that bell, we'll<br> let the varmints know dinner's ready.<br> Oh, sure.<br> You better stay out<br> of that doorway, honey...<br> - before you get trompled on.<br> - What?<br> You better stay out of that doorway!<br> Howdy.<br> Just sit yourself down anywheres, honey.<br> We don't stand on no ceremonies.<br> Henry, move over. Let the lady in.<br> Where's your manners?<br> Henry, move over and give<br> the lady a place to sit.<br> I ain't Henry, Ma. I'm Albert.<br> That's Henry, remember?<br> Whatever your name is,<br> move over and give the lady a seat.<br> Just make yourself<br> comfortable, honey.<br> Okay, Pa.<br> Much obliged<br> for everything.<br> - Hey, Betty, what's this?<br> - My kitchen garden. I told you about it.<br> You didn't tell me<br> you were going to put it here.<br> - What's the matter with here?<br> - Nothing, except when it rains.<br> - The water's gonna come over that embankment in sheets.<br> - That's why I put it here.<br> - So it would get plenty of water.<br> - Have it your own way.<br> Come on, get dressed. We're gonna have<br> lunch at Harriet Putnam's, remember?<br> - Do we have to?<br> - Yep.<br> It certainly is<br> a beautiful layout.<br> Betty, maybe one of these days<br> we can have something like this.<br> - If we ever get a contract for our eggs.<br> - I could speak to Mr Henty.<br> He's the agent for Great Western Markets<br> out here. They buy all my dairy products.<br> I'd appreciate it. We're at the stage<br> where we can handle a steady contract.<br> I'll talk to him. He does almost anything<br> I ask him to do.<br> - He's such a dear.<br> - Ayoung man, I take it?<br> Ah, he used to be.<br> He's a little crotchety now, I'm afraid.<br> Besides, he has a wife.<br> Ha, those were<br> the old rules.<br> - Do you think we could go outside and look around?<br> - Oh, of course.<br> I love to show it off.<br> Just wait 'til we get to the barn...<br> and I show you<br> my Speckled Sussex.<br> - Her what?<br> - Speckled Sussex.<br> - That's a breed of hen. Very special too.<br> - Oh.<br> It's my theory an egg-raising flock ought<br> to be kept at 96% lay most of the year.<br> - I've got a headache.<br> - What do you think, Harriet?<br> Well, of course,<br> so much depends on the breed.<br> - I've got a headache!<br> - Huh?<br> - I've got a headache. I think I'd like to go home.<br> - That's too bad.<br> - Wouldn't you like to take something and lie down?<br> - No, I'd like to go home.<br> - Sort of hoping we could look around a little more.<br> - You can stay.<br> I can get home by myself.<br> I'm sure Miss Putnam...<br> will be only too glad to drive you home...<br> when she's through with you.<br> - I'm sorry we have to rush off like this.<br> - I understand.<br> Drop in sometime when you're driving by.<br> You haven't seen anything yet.<br> - I'll do that. Don't forget about Mr Henty.<br> - I won't.<br> - I do hope you'll feel better.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Do you have these headaches often?<br> - Often enough.<br> - Very interesting. Goodbye.<br> - Bye!<br> - Do you find Harriet attractive?<br> - She knows a lot about chickens.<br> If that's how you measure your women,<br> where does that leave me?<br> You don't have to know about chickens<br> to be attractive. A lot of women don't.<br> When I think of the years I spent learning<br> how to be irresistible to my husband.<br> All you have to do<br> is cackle.<br> - I wonder if she could.<br> - Could what? Cackle?<br> No. Take you<br> away from me.<br> - Don't be an idiot.<br> - It's happened, you know.<br> Men have no sense at all when it<br> comes to women. Babes in arms.<br> - Will you stop? I can take care of myself.<br> - Every man has his danger point.<br> Just get beyond it and...<br> he's a goner.<br> - Don't talk like that.<br> - It's true.<br> Your danger point might happen<br> to be Harriet Putnam's beautiful house...<br> and all that expensive farm machinery<br> and those fat Hereford cows...<br> touched by no human hand,<br> poor things.<br> I am not interested in Harriet Putnam's<br> beautiful house...<br> or her farm machinery<br> or her cows.<br> I'm only interested<br> in chickens and, uh, you.<br> Oh, look out!<br> Oh, now look what you've done.<br> What's that?<br> That is a flat tyre.<br> It isn't enough<br> to go in the ditch.<br> - What are we going to do now?<br> - We're going to change it.<br> Oh. Well.<br> - Lucky I got some new equipment or<br> we really would be stuck. - Mm-hmm.<br> - That's funny.<br> - What are you looking for?<br> - The jack!<br> - Is that it?<br> No, that's a wrench.<br> Don't you know the difference?<br> Oh, is a jack that kind of funny-looking<br> thing that goes up and down?<br> - Yes, that's it.<br> - Oh, that.<br> - Where is it?<br> - I... used it yesterday...<br> to prop open<br> the kitchen door.<br> You see, Sport was...<br> - It's probably there now.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> All we need now to make<br> the day perfect is for it to rain.<br> You had to open your big mouth.<br> Bob! My garden!<br> - Don't say it! You told me so!<br> - It's too bad, honey.<br> Bob, we've got to get away<br> from here before it's too late.<br> They don't want us here. The mountains,<br> rain, wind, they don't want us here!<br> - They're fighting us all the time!<br> - Stop it.<br> - It'll be all right.<br> - We've got to get away before we lose everything!<br> - Before we lose each other!<br> - Betty!<br> Betty, wait!<br> "Stir rapidly. "<br> "... rapidly... and drop<br> gently into pot. "<br> Well.<br> - Betty, where are my guns?<br> - In the closet.<br> - What's the matter? What?<br> - Cougar!<br> - A cougar!<br> - What's that?<br> Something like a lion.<br> Very dangerous.<br> - Oh.<br> - He's in the woods back of the barn.<br> Crowbar and Geoduck<br> just told me. They saw him.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - Shoot him!<br> - Why? Won't he go away?<br> - No, he's after the livestock.<br> Oh.<br> Maybe if you'd just<br> leave him alone, he'd disappear.<br> Cougars don't disappear.<br> You have to shoot 'em!<br> Here you are, Crowbar.<br> Now we'll get Sport.<br> He's a great hunting dog. Be a wonderful<br> chance to see how he works.<br> - Look at him, he's raring to go.<br> He's got the scent already.<br> - Stand aside when I let him out.<br> He's pretty wild.<br> All right, boy, after him! Hey, Sport!<br> - Sport, this way! Sport, where are you going?<br> - Bob!<br> - Hey, Sport!<br> - Bob!<br> - Where is he?<br> - He's under the stove! What is it, the cougar?<br> - No, it's Sport. Sport, come on, boy.<br> - Sport?<br> Come on, we're<br> going hunting. Cougar!<br> Sport, come on, boy. Come on, Sporty.<br> Sport, come out of there!<br> All right, stay there.<br> That dog is... is dishonest.<br> Okay, it's safe now.<br> You can come out.<br> Bob! Bob!<br> Bob, they're here!<br> Hurry up!<br> Oh, oh.<br> Oh, you little darlings you.<br> Oh, aren't they cute!<br> - What's happened? What's the matter?<br> - Look, millions of them!<br> Aren't they wonderful?<br> - Be careful, they injure very easily.<br> - Wait 'til Mr Henty sees.<br> I'll bet he'll get us the biggest egg<br> contract in the county.<br> - Oh, do we have to name them all?<br> - They're not pets, you know.<br> They're our stock in trade. If they<br> don't get jammed under the brooder...<br> and smother or drown in the drinking<br> fountain or get coccidiosis...<br> or peck each other to death,<br> we may be in the chicken business yet.<br> If you feel that way about them,<br> why not drown 'em all now?<br> After you've fed and watered them every three<br> hours until they can take care of themselves...<br> you won't feel<br> so sentimental about them.<br> If you kids had any sense, you'd go<br> right back where you came from.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm cutting down a tree.<br> - Whatever for? It's a lovely tree.<br> - To clear space for the new chicken house.<br> Oh, don't you think it's kind of awful<br> to cut down a tree?<br> We're not running a park here. Stand over<br> there so the chips don't fly in your face.<br> - Won't it fall on the chicken house?<br> - No, no, dear, it won't.<br> Looks like it to me.<br> Darling, you take care of the kitchen<br> and I'll take care of the tree.<br> I just thought,<br> that's all.<br> Honey, it just so happens that I spent<br> a whole summer in a logging camp once.<br> I've watched experts<br> fall tree after tree.<br> Just the same.<br> Look, dear, this isn't a matter of guesswork.<br> It's a matter of science.<br> It's a question of leverages, weights and<br> balances which I've worked out to the nth degree.<br> The tree isn't going to fall on the chicken<br> house. It's going to fall right there.<br> If you don't believe it,<br> just wait and see.<br> If you don't mind, I'll wait in the house<br> where I'll be safe.<br> Timber!<br> No! No! No!<br> Bob? Bob!<br> Bob, where are you?<br> Where are you, Bob?<br> Oh!<br> Timber!<br> Very funny.<br> Is that you, Bob? Dinner's ready.<br> Be there in a minute.<br> Oh, Bob.<br> I hope I'm not late.<br> Happy Tuesday.<br> - Oh, thanks to you and many of them.<br> - I like your gown.<br> - Have I seen it before?<br> - Yes, I wear it at all my weddings.<br> - Where would you like to dine?<br> - Wherever you say.<br> There's the Palace Hotel in San Francisco.<br> Wonderful food.<br> Or Antoine's in New Orleans<br> if you like bouillabaisse.<br> - Or we might hop over to New York and try "21."<br> - Yes, let's try "21."<br> All right. Oh, Mac,<br> you have a table for us?<br> This one right here?<br> This is our table here.<br> Wonderful-looking food,<br> and a wonderful-looking chef.<br> - An excellent dinner. My compliments.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Shall we go dancing?<br> - I wouldn't mind.<br> - The Stork Club's just around the corner.<br> - That sounds fine.<br> - I'll have the orchestra play something special.<br> - All right.<br> Oh, darling, thanks<br> for a wonderful evening.<br> - You the folks that live here?<br> - Why, yes.<br> Well, I'm Henty,<br> Great Western Markets.<br> Henty? Oh, Mr Henty.<br> It's Mr Henty.<br> - How do you do, Mr Henty?<br> - Knocked on the front door, nobody answered.<br> So I come around by the back way.<br> Interrupting something, am I?<br> No, my wife and I were just,<br> uh... Oh, this is my wife.<br> How do you do, Mr Henty?<br> We were just celebrating...<br> - our anniversar...<br> - Birthday...<br> - I see. Maybe I better make it another time.<br> - Oh, don't go.<br> - We're all through, aren't we, Bob?<br> - Of course, we are.<br> Come and sit down.<br> We're certainly glad to see you.<br> - Sit down there.<br> - Well, just for a minute.<br> - Would you, uh, care for a cigar, Mr Henty?<br> - Never touch 'em.<br> - Bob, perhaps Mr Henty would like a drink.<br> - Of course.<br> - Don't touch that either.<br> - Oh, well...<br> we just keep it<br> around in case.<br> - Some people do, you know?<br> - So I've heard tell.<br> Oh, isn't this nice, your dropping in<br> on us like this, Mr Henty.<br> - We've heard so much about you.<br> - We certainly have.<br> I was over to Miss Putnam's.<br> Wonderful lady.<br> - Yes, wonderful.<br> - She's my dearest friend.<br> - She told me you people might have some eggs to sell.<br> - That's right, we have.<br> Thought I'd drop 'round on<br> the way home, look things over.<br> Mighty glad you did.<br> We're not up to full production yet...<br> - but be glad to show you the layers we have.<br> - Won't be necessary.<br> I judge my eggs by the people<br> that produce 'em.<br> "Like chicken, like master,"<br> I always say.<br> When I was a little girl...<br> I got seven medals for perfect attendance<br> at Sunday school.<br> - Didn't I, Bob?<br> - Yes!<br> Yes, she did. That's the...<br> main reason I married her.<br> I was an Eagle Scout myself.<br> - Well...<br> - You're not going to leave us so soon.<br> - It's early. You just got here.<br> - Don't believe in folks staying up too late.<br> - "Early to bed, early to rise... "<br> - "Makes a man...<br> healthy, wealthy<br> and wise. "<br> - How right you are.<br> - Where's my hat?<br> It's right over there...<br> Sport! I'll get it.<br> Sport, get off.<br> Very friendly dog.<br> He likes to sit on hats.<br> Here, I'll fix it.<br> Never mind,<br> I'll do it.<br> How many dozen eggs do you think<br> you'll be needing per week?<br> - Any idea?<br> - I don't know.<br> Got to think it over.<br> Goodnight.<br> - Goodnight, Mr Henty.<br> - Goodnight, Mr Henty. Come again.<br> - Well, that's the end of Mr Henty.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Gonna have to eat<br> an awful lot of omelets.<br> Oh, why did he have to show up tonight?<br> Oh, well.<br> Hey, I just remembered.<br> I never did carry you over the threshold.<br> That's right, you didn't.<br> Oh, just a minute.<br> Now.<br> Send up another batch of them nails,<br> and I figure we'll be all set.<br> - Okay, drop 'er down.<br> - There she goes.<br> Say, is Ma home?<br> - I've got business with her.<br> - That's where I left her.<br> - All right, take it away.<br> - Up she goes.<br> Betty, how do you like it?<br> All set up and ready to go.<br> You'll have water in the kitchen any<br> minute now. All we have to do is fill it up.<br> - Think it'll work?<br> - Oh, sure. Pa's an expert on water tanks.<br> He may not know about anything else,<br> but he knows about water tanks.<br> He says.<br> Hello!<br> - Bob, I need your help.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Just about everything. My generator<br> broke down and everything is stopped.<br> The cows haven't been milked. The chickens<br> can't be fed. My dairy products are ruined.<br> My foreman hasn't the slightest idea<br> what to do about it.<br> - I can leave here for a while. I'll come over.<br> - Would you?<br> Why don't you get Tom Kettle?<br> He's a genius with machinery.<br> I couldn't possibly trust him.<br> He's such a boy. This is a man's job.<br> I see what you mean.<br> Uh-huh.<br> - Be back for lunch.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Bye.<br> Hello!<br> Come right on in!<br> Don't stand on no ceremony.<br> - Come on in!<br> - I came to bring you something. It's a present.<br> - For me?<br> - Yep.<br> - Jiminy whizz!<br> - I made it myself. Do you like it?<br> Drat my hide and call me a possum.<br> Ain't this somethin'?<br> I thought you might like to wear it<br> at the dance tonight, so I rushed it.<br> - You might have to do over a couple of the seams.<br> - I ain't never been so surprised.<br> First new dress I've had<br> since way back before the war.<br> - Stylish too, ain't it? - You'll<br> be the best-dressed girl at the ball.<br> - Can't imagine why you went to all this trouble for me.<br> - It's no trouble, it's fun.<br> - Get some of them cookies and I'll pour some coffee.<br> - All right.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> Pay it no mind. Just leave it.<br> Might as well be one place as another.<br> Come on, get away.<br> When I was first married, I was<br> as neat as the next woman.<br> Tried to keep my house<br> and kids clean.<br> But Pa's an awful<br> old lazy so-and-so.<br> It was fight, fight, fight all the time,<br> so finally give it up.<br> I can't make Pa change and be neat,<br> so I'll have to change and be dirty.<br> Been peace in this house ever since.<br> There, ain't this pretty?<br> - It's perfectly beautiful.<br> - Made one every year since I was married.<br> Got 'em in the closet<br> in the spare room.<br> Figured it'd be something real nice<br> to leave the kids when I die.<br> Why don't you enter it<br> in the county fair?<br> - Oh, you should! It's a wonderful idea.<br> - What in tarnation fer?<br> You might win first prize.<br> You could give the money to Tom.<br> - He could enter college. Wouldn't that be grand?<br> - 'Tain't no use.<br> Birdie Hicks will win.<br> She wrangles things around every year...<br> so one of her relations gets on<br> the committee that judges them.<br> - You could try.<br> - I've got a better idea.<br> - When it's finished, I'm givin' it to you.<br> - Oh, no, I couldn't.<br> Oh, I got a whole parcel of'em laid away.<br> There ain't nobody I'd rather see have it.<br> - Oh!<br> - Take another one of them cookies, why don't ya?<br> Plenty where they come from.<br> I'll get you some to take home.<br> They're wonderful.<br> How do you make 'em?<br> Just a drop of this<br> and a drop of that.<br> - Mix it together<br> and shove it in the oven.<br> - You home already? 'Tain't near feeding time.<br> - Got your water tank up.<br> - Be havin' running water any minute now.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> - That'll be a relief.<br> - Never see the sense of running water in the house.<br> Rather get mine straight out of<br> the ground where the good Lord put it.<br> I don't hold with too much water anyhow.<br> Rusts the bones.<br> Well, I'll chance it.<br> Thank you, goodbye.<br> Mighty fine of you to make me<br> that dress, honey. I appreciate it.<br> I got the best of the trade.<br> It doesn't hold a candle to your quilt.<br> - See you at the party tonight!<br> - You bet.<br> - Hello there!<br> - Hello!<br> - Oh, hello.<br> - Hiya, kids!<br> - How do I look?

Don't you recognize her?<br> - Oh! You mean it's...<br> - It's Cleopatra.<br> It's our donation.

Fresh out of the still<br> this afternoon. None of that old stuff.<br> - Is my head still on?<br> - I can't see it anyplace.<br> - Oh, Bob.<br> - Yipe.<br> - Are you took?<br> - What?<br> - Are you took?<br> - He wants to dance.<br> I'm sorry, I'm engaged.<br> Betty, at affairs like this you're supposed<br> to dance with anybody that asks you.<br> - Otherwise they'll say you're a snob.<br> - Are you ready?<br> Ah. Yes.<br> Betty doesn't seem to be able to find<br> a partner that fits her.<br> - I better rescue her.<br> - Get me a cold drink first, please.<br> - I'm dying of thirst.<br> - Well...<br> I certainly had a hard time getting to you.<br> You're the most popular girl.<br> It's an honour<br> I'd gladly give up.<br> I've been pushed and pulled around this floor.<br> I don't know whether I'm coming or going.<br> You wouldn't like to sit this one out,<br> would you, and give my feet a rest?<br> Oh, sure, I'll get you<br> something to drink.<br> - May I?<br> - Oh, must you? Couldn't you some other time?<br> "Never put off until tomorrow<br> what you can do today,"<br> Billy Reed's motto<br> in work or play.<br> - Think we could slow down a bit?<br> - Follow the lead with Billy Reed.<br> If I have any feet left.<br> Oh, thank heavens.<br> - Don't you ever get tired?<br> - Vitamin pills.<br> - Yeah, I know, you sell them.<br> - Greatest little item I handle.<br> I don't want any. I'd rather wear out<br> in my own way.<br> I've got to get out of here<br> while I can still walk.<br> I admire you tremendously.<br> You're one in a million.<br> - Greatest sales resistance I ever met up with.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> - It's no effort at all.<br> - Try and resist if you can, but Billy Reed will get his man.<br> But I'm not a man.<br> - How's this?<br> - Fine.<br> Ah, Bob, can't we talk<br> about something besides chickens?<br> - All right, what'll it be?<br> - What about you?<br> - Do you like your farm?<br> - Oh, sure.<br> And, Betty, does she like<br> being a farmer's wife?<br> She likes it fine.<br> It was rough at first.<br> But she's getting<br> used to it.<br> Men are such fools about women.<br> They invariably marry the wrong one.<br> - I wouldn't say that.<br> - All my husbands did.<br> - Oh, Bob, darling, are you hurt?<br> - No, but...<br> Party's getting rough.<br> I think we better go in.<br> - Harriet, would you excuse me?<br> - Of course. See you later.<br> Getting some air?<br> How long have you<br> been out here?<br> I just came out this minute.<br> It was awfully hot in there.<br> - Having a good time?<br> - Somebody hit me on the head with this shoe.<br> - No. What for?<br> - Just trying to be funny, I guess.<br> Oh, for heaven's sake.<br> Oh, don't do that.<br> It's mine!<br> - So it was you?<br> - Yes, now you go right out there and get it.<br> - What was the idea?<br> - Must be over in those bushes.<br> - I repeat, "What was the idea?"<br> - I didn't mean to hit you, honest.<br> - I meant to hit her. Did it hurt?<br> - Of course it hurt!<br> I don't see why you don't<br> like Harriet; she likes you.<br> - She said she admires you very much.<br> - Now she's saying nice things.<br> - That's just why I don't like her...<br> - You're being childish.<br> - I am not being childish!<br> - Shh!<br> That barnyard glamour girl<br> is setting a trap for you.<br> You're just goofy<br> enough to fall into it.<br> You know, I don't like to point, but you're<br> beginning to make a noise like a jealous female.<br> - This isn't becoming.<br> - What does she got that I haven't got?<br> - Except chickens.<br> - For one thing, she hasn't got me...<br> - as you seem to think.<br> - It's hardly noticeable.<br> You're not really serious about this?<br> You know better.<br> Every time I look around<br> you've got your heads together.<br> - It's getting monotonous.<br> - I should think you could trust me.<br> - In my book, a marriage without trust doesn't amount to much.<br> - I trust you.<br> - It's Miss Dreamy-puss I don't trust.<br> - Thanks for the confidence.<br> If I had a farm like hers with running water<br> and plumbing and electricity...<br> and machines to take care of the livestock,<br> I'd have more time to concentrate on you too.<br> So it isn't me you're<br> jealous about, it's her farm.<br> I'd like to see her carry water<br> from the well to the house.<br> What do you want to do, Betty, give up?<br> All you have to do is say the word.<br> When are we going to get a farm<br> like that, with machines and gadgets...<br> - and little men all over the place doing things?<br> - When we've earned it.<br> - Did she earn it?<br> - That's different. With her, her farm's a hobby.<br> With me, it's a cause. I want to carve it<br> out of rock with my bare hands.<br> And mine, don't forget.<br> Just look at them.<br> You'd never believe they used to get<br> a manicure twice a week.<br> - Never did anything rougher than play the piano.<br> - They're being a lot more useful.<br> - You should be very proud of them.<br> - I've got a great idea.<br> Why don't you poison me and marry her?<br> You'd make a wonderful husband for her.<br> Fine!<br> I like that.<br> We could spend our honeymoon<br> in the electric chair, thinking about you.<br> Attention, folks. Quiet, please.<br> Sheriff Drum is here to make<br> a very important announcement.<br> We better go see what's up.<br> But what about my shoe?<br> I don't like interruptin',<br> but we've got trouble.<br> - Is Pa Kettle here?<br> - Right over this way, sir.<br> - Pa, you better get home. Your barn's on fire.<br> - Jehoshaphat.<br> I told you that still of yours would<br> blow up someday, and by golly, it did!<br> - Ma!<br> - We're comin', Pa! Tom!<br> Here, Ma!<br> That ain't all, folks.<br> A westerly wind blew up and carried<br> the flames to the woods just beyond.<br> Now, we've got a man-sized forest fire<br> on our hands, moving up the whole valley.<br> We did the best we could,<br> but it sort of got out of hand.<br> I suggest all you folks that have<br> homes up in that district...<br> - that you get along.<br> - Come on, Betty.<br> We can use all the volunteers<br> that we can get.<br> Looks pretty bad. We better<br> wet down the barn and chicken houses.<br> I'll get a shoe.<br> Lucky we built this tank. It'll give us<br> enough pressure to do some good.<br> Take it up to the barn.<br> We'll start on that first.<br> - Don't let it kink.<br> - No. Okay.<br> Here it comes.<br> Oh, Bob, look out!<br> Well, that's that. I guess<br> Pa can't build tanks either.<br> We could carry pails<br> of water from the well.<br> No, we couldn't do it<br> fast enough to do any good.<br> - You better get back to the house and start packing.<br> - Packing?<br> If the wind changes, we're a cooked goose.<br> We'd better be ready.<br> - I'll go get the animals out.<br> - Oh, Bob.<br> - Don't worry, honey. We'll manage.<br> - Sure we will.<br> - Wind's changin'!<br> - Comin' from the east!<br> - Headin' this way!<br> - Only thing can save you now is for it to rain.<br> - Doesn't look like it's going to.<br> - I better get back to the house.<br> - Sorry about that still.<br> - Couldn't be helped.<br> No use doing anything more here, men.<br> Thanks for your help anyway.<br> Get!<br> Bob!<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yeah, I'm all right.<br> - How is it?<br> - The wind shifted. If it doesn't rain, we'll be burned out.<br> - Do you think it will rain?<br> - Doesn't look like it.<br> It'll be the only time it hasn't.<br> We better finish packing,<br> get the truck loaded.<br> - Well, not very pretty, is it?<br> - It's awful.<br> Anyway it rained<br> before the house burned.<br> Something to be<br> thankful for.<br> Betty, this is it.<br> We're finished.<br> I wonder if Saddle, Finch, Tanner,<br> Pease and Stuck will take me back.<br> Not in<br> those clothes.<br> I'll have to dig out<br> the double-breasted with a pinstripe.<br> I think you look handsome<br> in the double-breasted with a pinstripe.<br> Certainly going to take a lot of building<br> to get this place going again.<br> Yeah, new barn,<br> new chicken house, new pigpen.<br> Plant a new orchard.<br> Gonna be a lot of work for somebody.<br> - When do we begin?<br> - "We"?<br> - I don't know who else, do you?<br> - Betty, you're crazy.<br> - I know when I'm licked.<br> - Just on account of a little fire?<br> What's the matter with you?<br> They built up Chicago after the fire.<br> And San Francisco.<br> If they can build up a couple of cities...<br> we ought to be able<br> to build up a chicken farm.<br> You mean you want to,<br> really?<br> - I want to, really.<br> - I don't want to quit either.<br> I'd never feel right about it.<br> I was just thinking about you.<br> - We're not going to quit.<br> - Oh, Betty.<br> I think you've outgrown<br> the double-breasted pinstripe anyway.<br> If that's Harriet Putnam, all I can say is,<br> she picked the wrong day!<br> No, it sounds like<br> something's up.<br> You got yourselves pretty well<br> burned out last night.<br> Livestock, buildings,<br> crops, most everything.<br> There's hardly one of us that hasn't<br> got more than he can use at this time.<br> So, we've gotten together to give you<br> whatever might be necessary to get you started.<br> I don't want you young people to think<br> we've come here with charity.<br> Nothing of the sort.<br> You took a bad beating<br> last night. No denying that.<br> But you're not the first,<br> and you won't be the last.<br> We know that you're not foolish enough to<br> be feelin'sorry for yourselves this morning.<br> We've all had our share of troubles,<br> everybody that you see gathered here.<br> If it wasn't fire,<br> it was something else.<br> Sickness, death,<br> bad crops, one thing or another.<br> But that's the Lord's way.<br> I guess He knows what He's doing.<br> Now, folks, I'm gonna call<br> your names off of this list.<br> I want you to reply and tell me<br> what you're going to give...<br> what your donation is.<br> Whether it's a couple of days<br> work or a jar of preserves.<br> Whatever it may be,<br> just speak right up.

Won't you sit down?<br> - Thank you.<br> My husband's been delayed,<br> and I hate being home alone.<br> - Won't you have some coffee? I was just going to.<br> - That would be lovely.<br> I don't seem to remember<br> seeing you anywhere.<br> No, we don't seem to get around<br> as much as we used to.<br> Albert and me keep pretty much<br> to ourselves these days.<br> Don't we, dear?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Oh, my.<br> I don't believe you've met<br> my husband yet, have you?<br> This is Albert.<br> He's so retiring.<br> Sometimes people<br> just don't notice him at all.<br> How do you do?<br> Oh, my, don't they<br> look delicious though!<br> Did you make them yourself?<br> - Does he want any, do you think?<br> - Oh, no, dear.<br> Albert never touches sweets.<br> Not good for his figure.<br> Albert and me used to have<br> a chicken farm too, a long time ago.<br> Didn't we, dear?<br> It was so nice.<br> Everything was so happy<br> until Charlotte came.<br> - You heard about Charlotte?<br> - No.<br> Didn't ya? She was<br> just a plain, ordinary...<br> little white leghorn<br> when she was hatched.<br> But as time went on, she got bigger<br> and bigger and bigger and bigger...<br> and bigger,<br> until she was this high.<br> Higher than a man.<br> That's when I begun<br> to notice she wasn't friendly.<br> She used to look at Albert and me<br> as if she could peck us right to pieces.<br> It made me nervous,<br> I can tell you.<br> Once when I was getting into bed, I<br> heard a scratching noise and I looked up.<br> There she was, staring<br> at me through the window.<br> The wickedest look<br> in her eye you ever saw.<br> Then one night, Albert and me<br> was sitting in the kitchen...<br> having a cup of coffee, just like we are now,<br> when I heard a noise on the porch.<br> Before we could take any notice of it,<br> there was a knock at the door.<br> Knock, knock, knock.<br> Oh, there you are, Emily.<br> I thought I'd find you here.<br> Hello, Sheriff.<br> I've been expecting you.<br> You've been a bad girl again, Emily.<br> Come along, Albert.<br> It's time to go back now.<br> Thank you very much.<br> We've had a lovely visit.<br> You must drop in<br> and see us sometime.<br> She's a good soul.<br> - Hope she didn't disturb you too much, ma'am.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - I enjoyed every minute.<br> - Emily's harmless enough.<br> She walks out once in a while.<br> It's up to us to come and fetch her.<br> But it's never any trouble finding her.<br> She always comes to this place.<br> - She used to live here.<br> - Sh-She lived here?<br> Yes, she and her husband<br> used to raise chickens.<br> Made a very nice thing<br> out of it too.<br> Then one day Albert<br> ran off with another gal.<br> We've never seen<br> hide nor hair of him since then.<br> Drove poor Emily plumb loco.<br> Well, goodnight, ma'am.<br> Sleep tight.<br> Leaving me all alone.<br> Lunatics running all over the place...<br> with husbands you can't see<br> and chickens bigger than a man.<br> You can't do this to me,<br> Bob, you understand?<br> I won't put up with it another night!<br> No, I won't! Not another night!<br> Oh, no. Oh, no.<br> I'm losing my mind too.<br> Oh, Bob!<br> - What is it?<br> - Got a message for you, ma'am.<br> Thanks,<br> there's no answer.<br> My goodness, you didn't sleep<br> in your bed again last night.<br> Your mother's going to raise the roof<br> when she hears about this.<br> And what's more,<br> I'm going to tell her!<br> I told you, I can't sleep in it.<br> It's too soft.<br> Now, whoever heard<br> of a bed being too soft?<br> Stuff and nonsense. You'll have<br> no spine left sleeping on that sofa.<br> You were up early again too.<br> I heard you moving around the kitchen.<br> I can't help it, Emmy. I got in the habit.<br> The minute the sun rises,<br> I just have to get up.<br> First thing you'll know, you're going<br> to be sick, carrying on this way.<br> - Shall I fix your bath?<br> - Yeah, bring it in.<br> - "Bring it in"?<br> - Hmm? Oh.<br> Oh, I keep forgetting.<br> We have a room for<br> that here, haven't we?<br> Oh, land sakes, went right out of my mind.<br> I got a letter for you.<br> Looks like it might be<br> from your husband.<br> - Send it back unopened.<br> - You mean you're not gonna read it?<br> No! Send it back!<br> - Anything from Bob?<br> - No.<br> Betty, you don't mean to tell me you're<br> still sending his mail back unopened.<br> It's perfectly ridiculous.<br> No wonder he stopped writing you.<br> Mother, if he had any real interest in me,<br> he'd have been here months ago.<br> Emmy, I told you never to serve me eggs.<br> I can't stand the sight of them!<br> You've got to eat. You've got to keep<br> your strength up.<br> If I never see another egg,<br> it'll be all right with me.<br> Just as you say,<br> but I won't be responsible.<br> In my opinion, both you and Bob<br> are behaving very stupidly.<br> Mother, we've been all over this before,<br> now please, don't.<br> You know how I feel about interfering,<br> but I hate to see a good marriage...<br> break up because of<br> a lot of silly stubbornness.<br> In my opinion, you ought<br> to keep in touch with him...<br> especially at this time.<br> I don't want to be<br> in touch with him.<br> Nothing in the whole world would<br> make me go back to him again!<br> Nothing.<br> Isn't it funny how a little bit of nothing<br> like this makes everything else so unimportant?<br> You fight and struggle<br> and argue and...<br> do crazy things.<br> None of it makes<br> any difference.<br> This is what really counts.<br> Mother, I'm going back to Bob<br> just as soon as I can.<br> We're coming into your station, ma'am.<br> Better be getting started.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, here we go.<br> Get ready<br> to surprise your father.<br> It won't be long now, darling.<br> It's not much,<br> but it's home.<br> Remember, don't be too hard on it.<br> It'll grow on you after a while.<br> So will your father<br> when you get to know him.<br> He's a pretty nice fellow<br> in many ways.<br> Of course, he has some<br> strange ideas about how to live.<br> He can be taken in by any<br> designing female in a station wagon.<br> But on the whole,<br> he's really swell...<br> and awful cute.<br> Full of high ideals.<br> You could do a lot worse than<br> to grow up to be just like him.<br> What are you<br> stopping here for?<br> - You're lookin' for your husband, ain't ya?<br> - Yes?<br> Well, that's<br> where he lives.<br> Well, ain't you goin'in?<br> Drive back to the station.<br> Oh, you poor child.<br> It's not your fault he's your father.<br> Don't you worry.<br> They say there's nothing<br> to heredity anyway.<br> But if you ever grow up to be like him,<br> I'll never speak to you again...<br> as long as I live.<br> Oh, I only wish I had him here<br> a minute. I'd show him.<br> And that woman too.<br> Driver! Stop!<br> - Huh?<br> - Go right back to that house.<br> Yes, indeedy!<br> - Would you hold her for me for a minute?<br> - Huh?<br> - Ain't I gonna get to see nothin'?<br> - No!<br> But you're going<br> to hear plenty!<br> Get away from me, you traitor!<br> Very cosy.<br> - Betty?<br> - Don't you "Betty" me, you, you bluebeard!<br> - "Bluebeard"?<br> - You could hardly wait till I got out of your way...<br> so you could move over here with that<br> silly woman and her station wagon...<br> - and her automatic milkers...<br> - Now, wait a minute...<br> Wait 'til she finds out you're more<br> interested in those automatic milkers...<br> - than you are in her!<br> - Listen to me...<br> - I gave you the best years of my life!<br> - One year!<br> It seemed like 10! Washing, ironing,<br> cooking, keeping house...<br> tending pigs, chasing cows,<br> hatching eggs!<br> And for what? So you could run off with<br> the first idiot who made eyes at you.<br> - Are you through?<br> - Yes, I am for the moment.<br> If you have anything to say,<br> you'd better make it good.<br> I'll make it good, all right. I'm not<br> living with Harriet, as you seem to think.<br> I'm living by myself,<br> and do you know why?<br> Because my wife walked out on me before I had<br> a chance to tell her I bought this farm for her.<br> - You what?<br> - Yes, I bought it.<br> I hocked everything I owned<br> to make the down payment.<br> I wanted to surprise you. You were<br> wonderful and worked so hard.<br> - Don't think I didn't know and appreciate it.<br> - Oh, Bob!<br> Then what do you do?<br> The night I'm closing the deal...<br> after spending the whole afternoon<br> listening to her silly talk...<br> and sitting through a nine-course dinner<br> with crepe suzettes, which you know I hate...<br> and I finally get her to sign the deal<br> after promising half my life away...<br> I go home and what do I find?<br> A big sign: "I'm through!"<br> - Gone, just like that!<br> - Bob, I... I didn't know.<br> If you'd have had the decency<br> to read my letters, you'd have known.<br> - It's all in here.<br> - Oh, no, don't!<br> Bob, I'm so sorry.<br> It's like this, Betty.<br> If two people are going to get along,<br> they just have to believe in each other.<br> No matter what, always.<br> - Oh, Betty.<br> - Oh, Bob.<br> - I'm glad you're back.<br> - Oh, darling.<br> Oh!<br> - Do you know what day this is?<br> - Uh-uh.<br> Happy anniversary.<br> I mean, happy day<br> after our anniversary.<br> Same to you<br> and many of them.<br> - Do you remember this?<br> - What?<br> - Oh.<br> - We're a little off schedule, aren't we?<br> - Don't worry, darling. We'll make it.<br> - Where you going?<br> I've got a surprise<br> for you.<br> - Right on schedule.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, here.<br> - What's his name?<br> - Anne.<br> Oh.<br> - Glad to know you, Anne.<br> - Mr Bob! Mr Bob!<br> Better come right away, Mr Bob!<br> We got trouble in the chicken house.<br> - Those water pipes again?<br> - Busted wide open and them hens is goin'crazy! Ten drowned.<br> - Bob!<br> - Hmm? Oh!<br> - I'll be right with ya!<br> - Okay!<br> Don't go away, you two!<br> You see what I mean?<br> I could write a book.<br>
