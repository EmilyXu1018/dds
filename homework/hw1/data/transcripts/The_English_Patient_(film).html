Did you look?<br> - Yes.<br> Isn't it? A wedding present<br> from Katharine's parents.<br> We're calling it<br> Rupert Bear.<br> - Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.<br> - Almsy.<br> We can finally consign my old bird<br> to the scrap heap.<br> Mrs. Clifton,<br> I'd like to present...<br> - Count Almsy.<br> - Hello.<br> Geoffrey gave me your monograph<br> and I was reading up in the desert.<br> - Very impressive.<br> - Thank you.<br> I wanted to meet the man who could write<br> a long paper with so few adjectives.<br> Well, a thing is still a thing,<br> no matter what you place in front of it.<br> Big car, slow car,<br> chauffeur-driven car.<br> - Broken car.<br> - It's still a car.<br> - Not much use, though.<br> - Love?<br> Romantic love,<br> platonic love, filial love.<br> - Quite different things, surely.<br> - Uxoriousness.<br> That's my favorite kind of love.<br> Excessive love of one's wife.<br> Now there you have me.<br> - They're tourists.<br> - Absolute rot.<br> They're highly recommended<br> by the Royal Geographic Society.<br> She's charming and<br> has read everything.<br> - He's meant to be a ruddy good flier.<br> - We don't need another pilot.<br> He can make aerial maps<br> of the whole route.<br> You can't explore<br> from the air, Madox.<br> If you could explore from the air,<br> life would be very simple.<br> Contact.<br> Contact.<br> I should try<br> and move the bed.<br> I want you to be able<br> to see the view.<br> It's good. It's a view<br> from a monastery.<br> - I can already see.<br> - How?<br> - How can you see anything?<br> - No, no, not the window.<br> I can't bear<br> the light anyway.<br> I can see all the way<br> to the desert.<br> I'm turning you.<br> Exploring before the war,<br> making maps.<br> Is there sand in my eyes?<br> Are you cleaning sand from my ears?<br> No sand.<br> That's your morphine speaking.<br> I can see my wife<br> in that view.<br> Are you<br> remembering more?<br> - Could I have a cigarette?<br> - Are you crazy?<br> Why... Why are you so determined<br> to keep me alive?<br> Because I'm a nurse.<br> Bravo.<br> - Next!<br> - Katharine!<br> "The King insisted that<br> he would find some way...<br> "to prove beyond dispute...<br> "that his wife<br> was fairest of all women.<br> "'I will hide you in your room<br> where we sleep,' said Candaules...<br> - said Candaules."<br> - Candaules.<br> "Candaules."<br> Candaules.<br> Candaules tells Gyges that the Queen has<br> the same practice every night.<br> She takes off<br> her clothes...<br> and puts them on the chair<br> by the door to her room.<br> "'And from where you stand,<br> you will be able to gaze<br> on her at your leisure. "'<br> And that evening, it's exactly as<br> the King has told him.<br> She goes<br> to the chair,<br> removes her clothes<br> one by one,<br> until she's standing naked<br> in full view of Gyges.<br> And indeed, she was more lovely<br> than he could have imagined.<br> But then,<br> the Queen looked up...<br> and saw Gyges concealed<br> in the shadows.<br> And although she said<br> nothing, she shuddered.<br> And the next day,<br> she sends for... for Gyges<br> and challenged him.<br> - And hearing his story,<br> this is what she said.<br> - Off with his head!<br> She said, "Either you<br> must submit to death...<br> "for gazing on that<br> which you should not,<br> "or else kill my husband<br> who has shamed me...<br> and become King<br> in his place. "<br> So Gyges kills the King,<br> marries the Queen and becomes ruler<br> of Lydia for 28 years.<br> The end.<br> Shall I spin<br> the bottle?<br> So, Geoffrey,<br> let that be a lesson to you.<br> - D'Agostino!<br> - D'Agostino!<br> Are you asleep?<br> Yes.<br> No. I'm dropping off.<br> Go away!<br> Go! Go!<br> Buon giorno.<br> - Hana?<br> - What do you want?<br> I met your friend Mary.<br> She said I should stop and see<br> if you were all right.<br> Apparently we're neighbors. My house<br> is two blocks from yours in Montreal.<br> Cabot, north of Laurier.<br> - Bonjour.<br> - Bonjour.<br> For you.<br> I'd like to take credit for it,<br> but it's from Mary.<br> My name is David Caravaggio,<br> but nobody ever called me David.<br> Caravaggio they find<br> too absurd to miss out on.<br> Oh!<br> Oh!<br> Oh, shit.<br> Stupid hands.<br> Let me do that.<br> They're fresh.<br> I haven't had<br> an egg in...<br> Have you noticed<br> there are chickens?<br> In Italy, you get chickens<br> but no eggs.<br> In Africa, they're always eggs<br> but never chickens.<br> - Who's separating them?<br> - You were in Africa?<br> Yes, I was.<br> So was my patient.<br> Look, I'd like to<br> stay for a while.<br> I have to do<br> some work here.<br> I speak the language.<br> There are partisans to be disarmed.<br> We embrace them and see<br> if we can relieve them of their weapons,<br> you know,<br> while we hide.<br> I was a thief, so the army<br> thought I'd be good at it.<br> - So you can shoot a pistol?<br> - No.<br> Do you have a problem<br> with those?<br> No.<br> - I should look at them before you go.<br> - Look.<br> It's a big place.<br> We needn't disturb each other.<br> I'll sleep in the stable.<br> It doesn't matter where I sleep.<br> I don't sleep.<br> I don't know what Mary told you<br> about me, but I don't need company.<br> I don't need<br> to be looked after.<br> There is a man<br> downstairs.<br> He brought us eggs.<br> He might stay.<br> Why?<br> Can he lay eggs?<br> He's Canadian.<br> Why are people always so happy when they<br> collide with one from the same place?<br> What happened in Montreal<br> when you passed a man in the street?<br> Did you invite him<br> to live with you?<br> He needn't<br> disturb you.<br> He can't.<br> I'm already disturbed.<br> There's a war. Where you come from<br> becomes important.<br> Why? I hate that idea.<br> Ah!<br> It's gonna work.<br> Gently.<br> Can I help?<br> It's finished.<br> So, you're our<br> Canadian pickpocket?<br> Thief I think<br> is more accurate.<br> I understand you were in Africa.<br> Whereabouts?<br> Oh, all over.<br> All over?<br> I kept trying to cover<br> a very modest portion and still failed.<br> - Are you leaving us?<br> - Yes.<br> Now's our opportunity<br> to swap war wounds.<br> Then I'm definitely going.<br> Does she have<br> war wounds?<br> I think anybody<br> she ever loves...<br> tends to die on her.<br> - Are you planning to be the exception?<br> - Me?<br> I think you've got...<br> the wrong end<br> of the stick, old boy.<br> So...<br> Caravaggio.<br> Hana thinks<br> you invented your name.<br> And you've<br> forgotten yours.<br> I said that no one would ever invent<br> such a preposterous name.<br> And I said you can<br> forget everything,<br> but you never forget<br> your name.<br> Count Almsy.<br> That name mean<br> anything to you?<br> Or Katharine Clifton?<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - How much did you pay?<br> - Oh, hello.<br> They don't see foreign women<br> in this market. How much did you pay?<br> Um, 7, 8, I suppose.<br> - Which store?<br> - Why?<br> You've been cheated.<br> Oh, don't worry, we'll take it back.<br> I don't want<br> to take it back.<br> - This is not worth 8.<br> - It is to me.<br> - Did you bargain?<br> - I don't care to bargain.<br> That insults them.<br> I don't believe that. I think<br> that you're insulted by me somehow.<br> I'd be very happy to obtain<br> the correct price for this.<br> I apologize<br> if I appear abrupt.<br> I'm rusty at social graces.<br> How do you find Cairo?<br> - Did you visit the pyramids?<br> - Excuse me.<br> Or the Sphinx?<br> Latitude, 25, 33.<br> Longitude, 25, 16.<br> We attempt to drive northeast of Kofer,<br> we'll leave our bones in the desert.<br> - I disagree.<br> - You're Hungarian. You always disagree.<br> - Good evening, gentlemen.<br> - Good evening.<br> - How is your charming wife?<br> - Marvelous.<br> She's in love<br> with the hotel plumbing.<br> She's either in the swimming pool.<br> She swims for hours.<br> She's a fish. It's quite incredible.<br> Or she's in the bath.<br> Actually, she's just outside.<br> Chaps only<br> in the Long Bar.<br> Mrs. Clifton.<br> You'll have to forgive us. We're not<br> accustomed to the company of women.<br> Not at all. I was thoroughly<br> enjoying my book.<br> - The team is in mourning, darling.<br> - Oh, really?<br> I'm afraid we're not having much luck<br> obtaining funds for the expedition.<br> Oh. Well, what'll you do?<br> More modest expedition,<br> or even wait a year.<br> - It's a disaster.<br> - Remind our families we still exist.<br> Good heavens,<br> are you married, Madox?<br> Very much so.<br> We all are.<br> - Save my friend Almsy here.<br> - I feel much better.<br> Don't you, darling?<br> We were feeling rather self-conscious.<br> Let's toast, then.<br> Absent wives.<br> - Absent wives.<br> - And present ones.<br> And future ones.<br> Thank you.<br> Excuse me.<br> May I?<br> - Why did you follow me yesterday?<br> - I'm sorry. What?<br> After the market,<br> you followed me to the hotel.<br> I was concerned. A woman<br> in that part of Cairo, a European woman.<br> - I felt obliged to.<br> - You felt obliged to?<br> As the wife of<br> one of our party.<br> So why follow me?<br> Escort me, by all means.<br> But following me<br> is predatory, isn't it?<br> Could I ask you<br> to move?<br> I'm sorry, but I...<br> I'm sorry.<br> Of course.<br> - It's just when you move.<br> - How stupid of me.<br> - I can't really bear the pressure...<br> - Are you all right?<br> I was dreaming.<br> Awful.<br> Hana.<br> Hana, are you<br> all right?<br> Leave me alone.<br> You're in love with him,<br> aren't you?<br> Your poor patient.<br> You think he's a saint<br> because of the way he looks.<br> I don't think he is.<br> I'm not so<br> in love with him.<br> I'm in love with ghosts.<br> So is he.<br> He's in love with ghosts.<br> What if I told you<br> he did this to me?<br> How could he have?<br> When?<br> I'm one of his ghosts,<br> and he wouldn't even know it.<br> - I don't know what that means.<br> - Ask your saint who he is.<br> Ask him<br> who he's killed.<br> Please, don't creep<br> around this house.<br> See, I don't think<br> he's forgotten anything!<br> I think he wants to forget!<br> Gentlemen, to mapmaking.<br> To mapmaking!<br> And a special thank you<br> to Geoffrey and Katharine,<br> without whose fund-raising heroics,<br> we'd still be kicking our heels.<br> - To arm-twisting.<br> - Arm-twisting.<br> Did Katharine say Geoffrey<br> has to fly back to Cairo?<br> Return the favor.<br> Take a few photographs for the army.<br> Oh, um, what kind<br> of photographs?<br> Portraits.<br> The brigadier,<br> the brigadier's wife,<br> the brigadier's dog, brigadier<br> by the pyramids, brigadier breathing.<br> And I shall,<br> of course, be bereft.<br> I'll finally be able to<br> explore the Cairo nightlife.<br> I shall produce an authoritative guide<br> to the zinc bars and...<br> I want to say hareems. Are we<br> in the right country for hareems?<br> Harems.<br> - Bye, my love.<br> - Travel safe.<br> Catch up<br> in a week.<br> Clifton, safe journey.<br> You too. Good luck.<br> Glad the funds have turned up.<br> Clifton.<br> This is probably<br> none of my business.<br> Your wife.<br> - Think it's appropriate to leave her?<br> - Appropriate?<br> Well, the desert is, it's, uh...<br> for a woman, it's very tough.<br> I wonder if it's<br> not too much for her.<br> Are you mad? Katharine loves it here.<br> She told me yesterday.<br> - All the same, were I you...<br> - I've known Katharine<br> since she was three.<br> We were practically brother and sister<br> before we were man and wife.<br> I think I'd know what is and what isn't<br> too much for her.<br> I think<br> she'd know herself.<br> Very well.<br> Why are you people<br> so threatened by a woman?<br> I have come to love...<br> that little tap of the<br> fingernail against the syringe.<br> Tap.<br> Tap.<br> Tap.<br> Stop playing! Please, stop playing.<br> I don't have the key<br> to that door. You...<br> The Germans were here.<br> The Germans were all over this area.<br> They left mines<br> everywhere.<br> And pianos were their<br> favorite hiding places.<br> I see.<br> Sorry.<br> Then maybe you're safe<br> as long as you only play Bach.<br> He's German.<br> Is something funny?<br> No. I'm sorry.<br> I've met you before.<br> I don't think so.<br> Look. See?<br> Move that,<br> and no more Bach.<br> Lieutenant!<br> Are you all right, sir?<br> Fine, Sergeant.<br> So you're working<br> with the Italians.<br> Yeah, trying to get them<br> to give up their weapons.<br> I was a thief, so the army<br> thought I'd be good at it.<br> I like the Italians.<br> He wants us to move out.<br> He says there could be<br> He thinks I'm mad<br> because I laugh at him.<br> He's Indian.<br> - He wears a turban.<br> - No, he's Sikh.<br> If he wears a turban,<br> he's Sikh.<br> I'll probably marry him.<br> Really?<br> That's sudden.<br> My mother<br> always told me...<br> I would summon my husband<br> by playing the piano.<br> - I liked it better when<br> there were just the two of us.<br> - Why? Is he staying?<br> With his sergeant,<br> a Mr. Hardy.<br> We should charge.<br> Doesn't anyone have a job to do?<br> They have to clear all the roads<br> of mines. That's a big job.<br> In that case, I...<br> I suppose we can't charge.<br> No, we can't.<br> Thank you.<br> I've been thinking. How does someone<br> like you decide to come to the desert?<br> What is it? You...<br> You're doing whatever you're doing in<br> your castle, or wherever it is you live,<br> and one day you say,<br> "I have to get to the desert," or what?<br> I once traveled with a guide<br> who was taking me to Faya.<br> He didn't speak<br> for nine hours.<br> At the end of it, he pointed<br> at the horizon and said, "Faya."<br> That was a good day.<br> Actually, you sing.<br> - What?<br> - You sing.<br> All the time.<br> - I do not.<br> - Ask Al Auf.<br> Al Auf!<br> Give me your hand.<br> Thanks.<br> Madox!<br> Madox!<br> Madox!<br> - Come quickly!

Bermann!<br> Quick!<br> My God.<br> They're swimming.<br> They're swimming.<br> Ow!<br> - You okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> How do you explain...<br> to someone who has<br> never been here,<br> feelings which seem<br> quite normal?<br> I don't know,<br> my friend.<br> I don't know.<br> - Aaah!<br> - Kamal!<br> Bermann,<br> what are you doing?<br> Bermann!<br> Watch out!<br> Watch out!<br> - Get them out of the car!<br> - Let me help!<br> Almsy,<br> are you all right?<br> Yes, yes,<br> I'm fine.<br> My wrist!<br> Ah!<br> I'll be back as quick as I can,<br> Try to get<br> an additional radiator.<br> We can store it between here<br> and Pottery Hill. And a better jack.<br> - We planned badly.<br> - Bermann?<br> Safe journey.<br> Now what?<br> Let's get all<br> this stuff off.<br> - I'll stay behind, of course.<br> - Certainly not.<br> - I caused the problem. I shall stay.<br> - You can't. None of you can.<br> No, I insist. There clearly<br> isn't room for all of us.<br> I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not<br> one of the walking wounded.<br> It's only one night.<br> If I remain, it's the most effective<br> method of persuading my husband...<br> to abandon whatever he's doing<br> and come and rescue us.<br> - All right.<br> - Come on, let's get going.<br> I thought you might like to<br> paste them into your book.<br> Well, we...<br> We took<br> photographs.<br> There's no need.<br> No, really.<br> I'd like you to have them.<br> Well, there's really no need.<br> This is, um...<br> This is just a scrapbook.<br> They are too good.<br> I should feel obliged.<br> Thank you.<br> And that would be unconscionable,<br> I suppose, wouldn't it?<br> To feel any obligation.<br> Yes, of course it would.<br> You should come<br> into the shelter.<br> I'm quite all right,<br> thank you.<br> - Look over there.<br> - What am I looking at?<br> Do you see what's happening to them,<br> the stars?<br> - They're so untidy.<br> I was trying to rearrange them.<br> - No, no.<br> Over there.<br> In a few minutes,<br> there'll be no stars.<br> The air<br> is filling with sand.<br> - This is not very good, is it?<br> - No.<br> - Will we be all right?<br> - Yes.<br> Yes.<br> Absolutely.<br> "Yes" is a comfort.<br> "Absolutely" is not.<br> Let me tell you<br> about winds.<br> There is a, a whirlwind<br> from southern Morocco,<br> the Aajej,<br> against which the Fellahin<br> defend themselves with knives.<br> And there is a,<br> a Ghibli from Tunis.<br> - A Ghibli?<br> - A Ghibli.<br> Which rolls and rolls<br> and rolls and produces a...<br> a rather strange nervous condition.<br> And then there is the,<br> the Harmatten,<br> a red wind, which mariners call<br> "the sea of darkness."<br> And red sand<br> from this wind...<br> has flown as far as<br> the south coast of England,<br> apparently producing...<br> showers so dense that they were<br> mistaken for blood.<br> Fiction!<br> We have a house on that coast<br> and it has never, never rained blood.<br> No, it's all true.<br> Herodotus, your friend.<br> - My friend.<br> - Your fri...<br> He writes about it...<br> and he writes about...<br> a, a wind, the Simoon,<br> which a nation thought<br> was so evil,<br> they declared war on it<br> and marched out against it.<br> In full battle dress.<br> Their swords raised.<br> Katharine, Katharine, I need<br> to get out your side, quickly.<br> A car!<br> Let me out!<br> Of course.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Ridiculous<br> to fall asleep!<br> Unforgivable!<br> Damn!<br> The flare!<br> Stop!<br> Over here!<br> - Here!<br> Stop!<br> Madox!<br> Madox! Madox!<br> Our tracks<br> have disappeared.<br> Madox will calculate how many miles.<br> He'll soon turn around.<br> Could I ask you,<br> please, to...<br> paste your paintings<br> into my book.<br> I... I should like<br> to have them.<br> I should be honored.<br> The others!<br> - Oh, God.<br> - Quick!<br> Oh, how awful!<br> We've got to get them out.<br> Quick!<br> Get the other shovel!<br> Am I a terrible coward<br> to ask how much water we have left?<br> A little in our can. We have, uh, water<br> in the radiator, which can be drunk.<br> And, uh, that's not cowardly at all.<br> It's extremely practical.<br> We, uh... Oh, come on!<br> Come on!<br> There's also a plant.<br> I've never seen it,<br> but I believe you can cut a piece<br> the size of a heart from this plant,<br> and the next morning it'll be filled<br> with a delicious liquid.<br> Find that plant,<br> cut out its heart.<br> Here.<br> Here's the window.<br> Clear the glass.

No.<br> No, I was never a spy.<br> It's ghastly.<br> It's like a witch hunt.<br> Anybody remotely foreign<br> is suddenly a spy.<br> - So watch out.<br> - Right.<br> We didn't care about<br> countries, did we?<br> Brits, Arabs,<br> Hungarians, Germans...<br> None of that mattered, did it?<br> It was something finer than that.<br> Yes, it was.<br> I'll leave the plane<br> in Kufra oasis.<br> - So, if you need it...<br> - Right.<br> Hard to know<br> how long one's talking about.<br> We might all be back<br> in a month or two.<br> Hmm.<br> I have to teach myself not to<br> read too much into everything.<br> It comes of too long having to read<br> so much into hardly anything at all.<br> Good-bye, my friend.<br> There is no God.<br> But I hope someone<br> looks after you.<br> In case you're<br> still wondering,<br> this is called<br> a suprasternal notch.<br> Come and visit us in Dorset<br> when all this nonsense is over.<br> You'll never come<br> to Dorset.<br> So, you didn't know<br> Madox shot himself.<br> No.<br> And you didn't kill<br> the Cliftons?<br> Sh...<br> She...<br> She die...<br> She...<br> I can't.<br> Well,<br> maybe I did.<br> Maybe I did.<br> I was packing up<br> our base camp...<br> at the Cave of Swimmers.<br> Clifton had offered to fly down<br> from Cairo to collect me.<br> He flew like<br> a madman always,<br> so I...<br> I took no notice.<br> Aaah!<br> Katharine?<br> Dear God, Katharine,<br> what are you doing here?<br> I can't get out.<br> I can't move.<br> "Surprise,"<br> he said.<br> Poor Geoffrey.<br> He knew.
