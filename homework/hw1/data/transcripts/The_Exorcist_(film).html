                        I sure do love you.<br> -Good morning.<br> -Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.<br> -How are you today?<br> -Fine, thank you.<br> It's okay, I've got it. Thanks.<br> -Good morning, madam.<br> -Good morning, Karl.<br> Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic.<br> You'd better get some traps.<br> Rats?<br> I'm afraid so.<br> But the attic is clean.<br> All right, then, we've got clean rats.<br> -No rats.<br> -I just heard them, Karl.<br> Maybe plumbing.<br> Yeah, or maybe rats.<br> Now, will you just get the traps?<br> Yes, I go now.<br> -Don't go now. The stores aren't open yet.<br> -I'll go see.<br> They're closed!<br> In the group over here,<br> I need a couple of priests, a nun....<br> That's exactly what we want.<br> Is this scene really essential? Would you<br> just consider if we can do without it?<br> Look at this damn thing.<br> It just doesn't make sense.<br> It's plain. You're a teacher of the college.<br> You don't want the building torn down.<br> -I can read, for Christ's sake!<br> -Well, what's wrong?<br> Well, why are they tearing<br> the building down?<br> Shall we summon the writer?<br> He's in Paris, I believe.<br> Hiding?<br> Fucking.<br> Scene 39: Hotel. Take four.<br> All right. Hustle back on in.<br> Is this your campus?<br> Let's get the Defense Department<br> off this campus!<br> It's our school!<br> They have no right!<br> I've seen enough killing in my life!<br> There's no reason for it anymore!<br> Wait a minute!<br> We're all concerned with human rights,<br> for God's sake...<br> ...but the kids who want<br> to get an education have a right, too!<br> Don't you understand? It's against<br> your own principle, for God's sake!<br> You can't accomplish anything<br> by shutting kids off from their....<br> If you want to effect any change,<br> you have to do it within the system.<br> Okay, cut! That's a wrap.<br> I think I'll walk home tonight, Mike.<br> Here, take that and drop it by my house.<br> Good night, Tom.<br> There's not a day in my life<br> that I don't feel like a fraud.<br> I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers.<br> I've talked to them all.<br> I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.<br> Hello?<br> In here.<br> -Hi. How did your day go?<br> -Not too bad.<br> It was like the Walt Disney version<br> of the Ho Chi Minh Story.<br> Other than that, it was terrific.<br> What have we got, anything exciting?<br> Also, you got an invitation.<br> What's this?<br> Dinner at the White House.<br> You're kidding!<br> Is it a big party or something?<br> I think it's five or six people.<br> Thursday? All right.<br> Hi, Mom.<br> What did you do today?<br> -Stuff.<br> -What does "stuff" mean?<br> Me and Sharon played a game<br> in the backyard.<br> And we had a picnic down by the river.<br> Mom, you should have seen it!<br> This man came along<br> on this beautiful gray horse.<br> Really? What kind?<br> Was it a mare, a gelding?<br> I think it was a gelding.<br> It was gray.<br> It was so beautiful.<br> The guy let me ride it<br> all around and everything.<br> She rode it for about half an hour.<br> I loved it! Mom, can't we get a horse?<br> -Not while we're in Washington, honey.<br> -Why not, Mom?<br> We'll see when we get home, okay?<br> -When could I have one?<br> -We'll see, Regan. We'll see.<br> On the party invitations,<br> I want to write a personal--<br> Regan, don't! Come back!<br> -All right, give it up. Give it up!<br> -No!<br> You'll be sorry!<br> Father?<br> Could you help an old altar boy?<br> I'm a Catholic.<br> Mama?<br> -I'm so glad to see you.<br> -You look good.<br> I'm all right.<br> -How's your leg?<br> -How about you? You are all right?<br> I'm fine, Mama.<br> Your Uncle John...<br> ...passed by to visit me.<br> Really? When?<br> Last month.<br> -Is that too tight?<br> -No.<br> You have to stay off it. You can't go<br> up and down the stairs. Give it a rest.<br> Okay.<br> I could take you somewhere where<br> you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.<br> There would be people around.<br> You wouldn't be sitting here<br> listening to the radio.<br> You understand me?<br> This is my house<br> and I'm not going no place.<br> Dimmy, you worry for something?<br> -No, Mama.<br> -You are not happy?<br> Tell me, what is the matter?<br> Mama, I'm all right. I'm fine. Really, I am.<br> Here it comes.<br> There!<br> -Look at that!<br> -Do you like it?<br> Isn't that funny?<br> I better put him over here to dry, though.<br> He's still wet.<br> Hey, where did this come from?<br> -I found it.<br> -Where?<br> In the closet.<br> Have you been playing with it?<br> -Yep.<br> -Do you know how?<br> I'll show you.<br> Wait a minute. You need two.<br> No, you don't. I do it all the time.<br> Well, let's both play.<br> You really don't want me to play?<br> No, I do! Captain Howdy said no.<br> -Captain who?<br> -Captain Howdy.<br> Who's Captain Howdy?<br> You know. I make the questions<br> and he does the answers.<br> -Captain Howdy. I see.<br> -He's nice.<br> I'll bet he is.<br> Here, I'll show you.<br> Captain Howdy,<br> do you think my mom is pretty?<br> Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice.<br> -Maybe he's sleeping.<br> -You think?<br> Why are you reading that stuff?.<br> Because I like it.<br> It's not even a good picture of you.<br> -You look so mature.<br> -I wouldn't talk!<br> You wouldn't talk?<br> I didn't have my makeup man there.<br> Let me take an eyelash off your face.<br> No, I didn't get it.<br> What are we going to do on your birthday?<br> Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?<br> No work? What can we do?<br> I don't know.<br> What would you like to do? Got any ideas?<br> Let me think....<br> We never finished seeing all the sights<br> in Washington.<br> We didn't get to the Lee Mansion,<br> lots of stuff.<br> Shall we do that? Go sightseeing?<br> -If it's a nice day?<br> -Yeah, let's do that.<br> And tomorrow night,<br> I'll take you to a movie.<br> I love you!<br> I love you, Rags.<br> We'll have a good day.<br> You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like.<br> Mr. Dennings?<br> Well, you know, it's okay.<br> Thank you very much...<br> ...but why would I want to bring Burke<br> on your birthday?<br> Well, you like him.<br> Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him?<br> What's going on? What is this?<br> You're going to marry him, aren't you?<br> You've got to be kidding!<br> Me marry Burke Dennings?<br> Don't be silly. Of course not.<br> Where did you ever get an idea like that?<br> But you like him.<br> Of course I like him. I like pizzas too,<br> but I'm not going to marry one.<br> You don't like him like Daddy?<br> Regan, I love your daddy.<br> I'll always love your daddy, honey.<br> Burke just comes around here a lot<br> because...<br> ...well, he's lonely.<br> He don't got nothing to do!<br> Well, I heard differently.<br> Oh, you did? What did you hear?<br> I don't know. I just thought.<br> Well, you didn't think so good.<br> How do you know?<br> Because Burke and I are just friends.<br> Okay? Really.<br> Are you ready for sleep?<br> Good night, honey.<br> It's my mother, Tom.<br> She's alone and I never<br> should have left her.<br> At least in New York, I'd be near her.<br> I'd be close to her.<br> I could see about a transfer, Damien.<br> I need reassignment, Tom. I want out<br> of this job. It's wrong, it's no good.<br> You're the best we've got.<br> Am I really?<br> It's more than psychiatry,<br> and you know that, Tom.<br> Some of their problems<br> come down to their faith...<br> ...their vocation, the meaning of their lives,<br> and I can't cut it any more.<br> I need out. I'm unfit.<br> I think I've lost my faith, Tom.<br> Hello?<br> Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.<br> Operator, you have got to be kidding!<br> I have been on this line for 20 minutes!<br> Jesus Christ! Can you believe this?<br> He doesn't even call his daughter<br> on her birthday!<br> Maybe the circuit is busy.<br> Circuit, my ass! He doesn't give a shit!<br> -Why don't you let me--<br> -No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right.<br> Don't tell me there's no answer.<br> It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome!<br> Would you try it again, please,<br> and let it ring?<br> Hello? Yes.<br> No, Operator,<br> I've given you the number four times!<br> Do you take an illiteracy test<br> to get that job, for Christ's sake?<br> Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!<br> Yeah?<br> You're kidding me!<br> I thought I just went to bed.<br> What are we doing, Scene 61?<br> Just remind Flo about that blue belt.<br> What are you doing here?<br> My bed was shaking.<br> I can't get to sleep.<br> Goddamn it!<br> Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that!<br> I'm very sorry, but you see? No rats.<br> No rats. Thanks a lot. That's terrific.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Unroll your fist.<br> Arm up.<br> Very good. That wasn't so bad, was it?<br> Remain perfectly still. Breathe normally.<br> Tell me if you feel a vibration.<br> Regan?<br> You feel anything?<br> Can you feel this?<br> I don't feel anything.<br> Put this in your mouth.<br> Keep it there.<br> This tells your temperature.<br> When the red light goes on...<br> ...that's your temperature.<br> I don't want it.<br> A disorder of the nerves...<br> ...at least we think it is.<br> We don't know yet exactly how it works.<br> It's often seen in early adolescence.<br> She shows all the symptoms.<br> Hyperactivity.<br> Her temper.<br> Performance in math.<br> Why the math? What is that?<br> It affects her concentration.<br> Now this is for Ritalin.<br> Is that a tranquilizer?<br> It's a stimulant.<br> A stimulant? My God,<br> she's higher than a kite now.<br> Her condition isn't quite what it seems.<br> Nobody knows the cause<br> of hyperkinetic behavior in a child.<br> The Ritalin seems to work<br> to relieve the condition.<br> And as to how or why,<br> we really don't know.<br> But her symptoms could be overreaction<br> to depression.<br> That's out of my field.<br> My daughter isn't depressed.<br> You mentioned her father<br> and the separation....<br> Do you think I should take her<br> to a psychiatrist?<br> No. I think we should wait<br> and see what happens with the Ritalin.<br> I think that's the answer.<br> Let's wait two, three weeks.<br> All right. And the lies she's been telling?<br> That's part of it?<br> -Lies?<br> -Like saying her bed's shaking.<br> Have you ever known<br> your daughter to swear?<br> -To use obscenities?<br> -No, never.<br> Interesting.<br> Similar to things like her lying...<br> -...it's uncharacteristic.<br> -I don't understand. She doesn't swear.<br> She let loose quite a string<br> while I was examining her.<br> I find that hard to believe.<br> What did she say?<br> Her vocabulary is rather extensive.<br> Well, give me an example. Like what?<br> Specifically, what did she say?<br> Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil...<br> ...she advised me to keep my fingers<br> away from her...<br> ...goddamned cunt.<br> I can't believe it.<br> You don't think a psychiatrist....<br> No. I think the best explanation<br> is always the simplest.<br> We'll wait. We'll wait and see.<br> In the meantime...<br> ...try not to worry.<br> How?<br> The edema affected her brain,<br> you understand?<br> She don't let no doctor come near her.<br> She was all the time screaming,<br> even talking to the radio.<br> You should've called me when it happened.<br> Regular hospital is not going<br> to put up with that, Dimmy.<br> We give her a shot and bring her here...<br> ...until the doctors fix up her leg,<br> then we take her right out.<br> Two or three months and she's out,<br> good as new!<br> We want to see Mrs. Karras.<br> -Do you have an appointment?<br> -Yes.<br> -Are you a relative?<br> -I am her brother. He is her son.<br> Just a minute.<br> You know, it's funny.<br> If you weren't a priest, you'd be<br> a famous psychiatrist now on Park Avenue.<br> Your mother would be living<br> in a penthouse instead of there.<br> You go in, Dimmy. I'll wait for you outside.<br> You'll find Mrs. Karras on the last bed<br> on the left-hand side.<br> It's Dimmy, Mama.<br> Why did you do this to me, Dimmy?<br> Why?<br> Come on, I'll take you out of here.<br> Mama, I'm going to take you home.<br> Mama, everything's going to be all right.<br> I'm going to take you home.<br> -Couldn't you have put her someplace else?<br> -Like what?<br> Private hospital?<br> Who's got the money for that?<br> You?<br> There seems to be an alien pubic hair<br> in my drink.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> Never seen it before in my life. Have you?<br> We're pretty comfortable up there...<br> ...compared to the Gemini and Mercury<br> programs, which were tight for space.<br> We've got about 210 cubic feet,<br> so we can move around.<br> If you ever go up there again,<br> will you take me along?<br> What for?<br> First missionary on Mars!<br> Tell me, was it public relations you did<br> for the Gestapo or community relations?<br> I'm Swiss!<br> Yes, of course.<br> And you never went bowling<br> with Goebbels, either, I suppose.<br> Nazi bastard!<br> Over behind the church. You know where<br> I mean? It's a red brick wing.<br> What goes on there?<br> Who's the priest I keep seeing there?<br> He's there all the time. He has black hair<br> and he's very intense looking.<br> -Who's that?<br> -Damien Karras.<br> That's his office the back of Saint Mike's.<br> He's our psychiatric counselor.<br> He had a pretty rough knock last night,<br> poor guy. His mother passed away.<br> She was living by herself, and...<br> ...l guess she was dead a couple of days<br> before they found her.<br> Cunting Hun!<br> Bloody, damned, butchering, Nazi pig!<br> Stop it! I'll kill you!<br> What's for dessert?<br> You sleeping?<br> Burke, your car's at the curb.<br> Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm.<br> Yes, honey. What?<br> Fuck it.<br> -Was he acting up!<br> -Blind is what he was.<br> Hi, Chris. It's a great party.<br> Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.<br> I don't need any encouragement. My idea<br> of heaven is a solid white nightclub...<br> ...with me as a headliner for all eternity,<br> and they love me.<br> "Down on the eastside<br> of toidy-toid and toid<br> "That's my home sweet home! "<br> I think we've got a guest.<br> You're going to die up there.<br> Oh, my God, honey.<br> Honey, what's the matter?<br> I'm sorry, she's been sick.<br> She didn't know what she was saying.<br> What made you say that, Regan?<br> Do you know, sweetheart?<br> Mother?<br> What's wrong with me?<br> It's just like the doctor said.<br> It's nerves, and that's all.<br> You just take your pills<br> and you'll be fine. Really.<br> Okay?<br> Is it coming out, Willie?<br> Yes, I think so.<br> Mother!<br> Where'd you get the money<br> for the Chivas Regal, the poor box?<br> That's an insult. I've got a vow of poverty.<br> Where'd you get it, then?<br> I stole it.<br> I believe you.<br> College presidents shouldn't drink.<br> Tends to set a bad example.<br> I figure I saved him from a big temptation.<br> Oh, Christ!<br> I should have been there. I wasn't there.<br> There was nothing you could do.<br> Lie down.<br> Give me the butt. Come on.<br> -Now you think you can sleep?<br> -Yes.<br> -Are you going to steal my shoes now?<br> -No.<br> I tell fortunes by reading the creases.<br> Now, shut up and go to sleep.<br> Good night.<br> Stealing is a sin.<br> I don't want it!<br> Honey, it's to help you.<br> I don't want it!<br> You fucking bastard!<br> Remember also, O Lord,<br> Thy servant, Mary Karras...<br> ...who has gone before us...<br> ...with the sign of faith,<br> and sleeps the sleep of peace.<br> "Lord, I am not worthy to receive you.<br> "But only say the Word<br> and I shall be healed.<br> "May the body of Christ bring thee<br> to everlasting life."<br> It's a symptom...<br> ...of a type of disturbance in<br> the chemical-electrical activity of the brain.<br> In your daughter's case,<br> in the temporal lobe.<br> Up here in the lateral part of the brain.<br> It's rare, but it does cause<br> bizarre hallucinations...<br> ...and usually just before a convulsion.<br> A convulsion?<br> The shaking of the bed.<br> That's doubtless due to muscular spasms.<br> No, no, that was no spasm.<br> I got on the bed.<br> The whole bed was thumping<br> and rising off the floor...<br> ...and shaking, the whole thing!<br> With me on it!<br> Mrs. MacNeil, the problem<br> with your daughter is not her bed.<br> It's her brain.<br> What causes this?<br> Lesion in the temporal lobe.<br> It's a kind of seizure disorder.<br> Look, Doc, I really don't understand<br> how her whole personality could change.<br> In the temporal lobe, it's very common.<br> It is?<br> It can last for days, even weeks.<br> It isn't rare to find destructive...<br> ...even criminal behavior.<br> Hey, do me a favor, will you?<br> Tell me something good.<br> Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion,<br> in a way, she's fortunate.<br> All we have to do is remove the scar.<br> Regan, can you sit up and scoot over here?<br> A little more.<br> Good.<br> I'm just going to move you down<br> on the table, okay?<br> That's just for a short time.<br> You're doing fine.<br> Very sticky.<br> Now, Regan, you're going to feel<br> something a little cold and wet.<br> Now you're going to feel a little stick here.<br> Don't move.<br> Good.<br> You're going to feel some pressure here.<br> Now, don't move.<br> Hook up!<br> There's nothing there.<br> No vascular displacement at all.<br> Do you want me to run another series?<br> I don't think so.<br> I'd like you to see her again.<br> Excuse me, Doctor.<br> Chris MacNeil is on the phone.<br> She says it's urgent.<br> Have you got some time?<br> Dr. Klein?<br> Yes, I'm Dr. Klein. This is Dr. Tanney.<br> Things have gotten worse since I phoned.<br> Come upstairs.<br> -Is she having spasms again?<br> -Yes, but they're violent.<br> -You gave her the medication?<br> -Yes.<br> -What was that?<br> -Thorazine.<br> Before that, it was Ritalin.<br> Chris, doctors.<br> Mother, please!<br> Please, Mother, make him stop!<br> It's burning! It's burning!<br> Do something, Doctor. Please, help her!<br> Make him stop! He's trying to kill me!<br> Mother!<br> Keep away!<br> The sow is mine!<br> Fuck me!<br> Fuck me!<br> Stay away from me!<br> Hold her tight!<br> Don't let them, Mother, please!<br> She's heavily sedated.<br> She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.<br> What was going on in there?<br> How could she fly off the bed like that?<br> Pathological states can induce<br> abnormal strength...<br> ...accelerated motor performance.<br> For example...<br> ...say a 90-pound woman sees her child<br> pinned under the wheel of a truck...<br> ...runs out and lifts the wheels<br> a half a foot up off the ground.<br> You've heard the story. Same thing here.<br> Same principle, I mean.<br> So what's wrong with her?<br> We still think that the temporal lobe--<br> What are you talking about,<br> for Christ's sake?<br> Did you see her or not?<br> She's acting like she's fucking<br> out of her mind!<br> Psychotic, like a split personality, or....<br> There haven't been more<br> than 100 authentic cases...<br> ...of so-called "split personality,"<br> Mrs. MacNeil.<br> Now, I know the temptation is<br> to leap to psychiatry...<br> ...but any reasonable psychiatrist would<br> exhaust the somatic possibilities first.<br> So, what's next?<br> A pneumoencephalogram,<br> I would think, to pin down that lesion.<br> It will involve another spinal.<br> Oh, Christ!<br> What we missed in the EEG<br> and the arteriograms...<br> ...could conceivably turn up there.<br> At least it would eliminate<br> certain other possibilities.<br> Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative.<br> In other words: normal.<br> Do you keep any drugs in your house?<br> No, of course not. Nothing like that.<br> Are you sure?<br> Of course, I'm sure.<br> I'd tell you.<br> Christ, I don't even smoke grass.<br> Are you planning to be home soon?<br> I mean to L.A.<br> No, l....<br> I'm building a new house.<br> My old one has been sold.<br> I was going to take Regan to Europe<br> for a while after she finished school.<br> Why do you ask?<br> I think it's time we started<br> looking for a psychiatrist.<br> Hello?<br> What do you mean going off<br> and leaving Regan by herself?.<br> Are you crazy? Her window's wide open!<br> -Didn't he tell you?<br> -Didn't who tell me?<br> What's Burke got to do with it?<br> Nobody was here.<br> When I went to get the Thorazine...<br> ...l had him stay with her, and....<br> -I should have known better.<br> -I guess you should have!<br> How were the tests?<br> We have to start looking for a shrink.<br> Hi, Chuck. Come on in.<br> I suppose you heard.<br> Heard what?<br> You haven't heard.<br> Burke is dead.<br> He must've been drunk.<br> He fell from the top of the steps outside.<br> By the time he hit M Street,<br> he broke his neck.<br> Oh, God!<br> Yeah, I know.<br> When I touch your forehead,<br> open your eyes.<br> Are you comfortable, Regan?<br> Yes.<br> How old are you?<br> Twelve.<br> Is there someone inside you?<br> Sometimes.<br> Who is it?<br> I don't know.<br> Is it Captain Howdy?<br> I don't know.<br> If I ask him to tell me,<br> will you let him answer?<br> No.<br> Why not?<br> I'm afraid.<br> If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you.<br> Do you want him to leave you?<br> Yes.<br> I'm speaking to the person<br> inside of Regan now.<br> If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized...<br> ...and must answer all my questions.<br> Come forward...<br> ...and answer me now.<br> Are you the person inside of Regan?<br> Who are you?<br> Father Karras?<br> Have we met?<br> No, we haven't met,<br> but they said I could tell.<br> That you look like a boxer.<br> William F. Kinderman. Homicide.<br> What's this all about?<br> It's true. You do look like a boxer.<br> Like John Garfield in Body And Soul.<br> Exactly. John Garfield.<br> Do people tell you that, Father?<br> Do people say you look like Paul Newman?<br> Always.<br> You know this director<br> who was doing the film here...<br> ...Burke Dennings?<br> I've seen him.<br> You've seen him.<br> You're also familiar how last week he died?<br> Only what I read in the papers.<br> Father, what do you know<br> on the subject of witchcraft?<br> From the witching end, not the hunting.<br> I once did a paper on it.<br> Really?<br> From the psychiatric end.<br> I know. I read it.<br> All of this desecration in the church...<br> ...do you think this has anything to do<br> with witchcraft?<br> Maybe. Some rituals used<br> in the Black Mass.<br> And now Dennings. You read how he died?<br> In a fall.<br> Let me tell you how. Please, Father...<br> ...confidential.<br> Burke Dennings, good Father...<br> ...was found at the bottom of those steps<br> leading to M street...<br> ...with his head turned completely around...<br> ...facing backwards.<br> That didn't happen in the fall?<br> It's possible.<br> -Possible, however--<br> -Unlikely.<br> Exactly.<br> So, on the one hand,<br> we've got a witchcraft kind of murder...<br> ...and on the other hand, a Black Mass-type<br> desecration in the church.<br> You think the killer<br> and the desecrator are the same?<br> Maybe somebody crazy...<br> ...somebody with a spite<br> against the Church.<br> Some unconscious rebellion.<br> A sick priest, is that it?<br> Look, Father, this is hard for you.<br> Please, I understand...<br> ...but for priests on the campus here,<br> you're the psychiatrist.<br> You'd know who was sick at the time,<br> who wasn't.<br> I mean, this kind of sickness,<br> you'd know that.<br> I don't know anyone<br> who fits that description.<br> Doctor's ethics.<br> If you knew, you wouldn't tell?<br> No, I probably wouldn't.<br> Not to bother you with trivia,<br> but a psychiatrist...<br> ...in sunny California, no less...<br> ...was put in jail for not telling the police<br> what he knew about a patient.<br> Is that a threat?<br> No, I mention it only in passing.<br> Incidentally, I mention it only in passing...<br> ...l could always tell the judge<br> it was a matter of confession.<br> Father, wait a minute!<br> -Do you like movies?<br> -Very much.<br> Well, I get passes<br> to the best shows in town.<br> Mrs. K, you know,<br> she gets tired, never likes to go.<br> That's too bad.<br> I hate to go alone.<br> I love to talk film...<br> ...discuss, to critique.<br> You want to see a film with me?<br> I've got passes to the Crest. It's Othello.<br> Who's in it?<br> Debbie Reynolds: Desdemona and Othello:<br> Groucho Marx. Are you happy?<br> I've seen it.<br> One last time. Can you think<br> of some priest who fits the bill?<br> Come on!<br> No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.<br> All right.<br> You know who I think really did it?<br> Who?<br> The Dominicans. Go pick on them.<br> I could have you deported, you know that?<br> I lied.<br> You look like Sal Mineo.<br> It looks like a type of disorder<br> that's rarely ever seen anymore...<br> ...except in primitive cultures.<br> We call it "somnambular-form possession. "<br> Quite frankly, we really don't know<br> much about it at all, except that...<br> ...it starts with a conflict or a guilt...<br> ...and it leads to the patient's delusions<br> that his body has been invaded...<br> ...by some alien intelligence:<br> A spirit, if you will.<br> Look, I'm telling you again,<br> and you'd better believe me...<br> ...l am not going to lock her up<br> in some goddamn asylum!<br> And I don't care what you call it.<br> I'm not putting her away!<br> I'm sorry.<br> You're sorry? Jesus Christ!<br> with all your bullshit is....<br> Of course, there is one outside chance<br> for a cure.<br> I think of it as a shock treatment.<br> As I said, it's a very outside chance.<br> Would you just name it, for God's sake?<br> What is it?<br> -Do you have any religious beliefs?<br> -No.<br> What about your daughter?<br> No.<br> Why?<br> Have you ever heard of exorcism?<br> Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the...<br> ...rabbi or the priest try to drive out<br> the so-called invading spirit.<br> It's been discarded these days...<br> ...except by the Catholics, who keep it<br> in the closet as a sort of embarrassment.<br> But it has worked...<br> ...in fact, although,<br> not for the reasons they think.<br> It's purely force of suggestion.<br> The victim's belief in possession...<br> ...is what helped cause it,<br> so in that same way...<br> ...the belief in the power of exorcism<br> can make it disappear.<br> You're telling me I should take<br> my daughter to a witch doctor.<br> Is that it?<br> Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?<br> She's going to be well?<br> Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,<br> I want you to tell me. Now, did you?<br> No, not me.<br> I didn't.<br> This was under Regan's pillow.<br> Did you put it there?<br> Of course, I didn't.<br> I didn't put it.<br> Excuse me, madam.<br> What?<br> -A man to see you.<br> -What man?<br> Might your daughter remember, perhaps...<br> ...if Mr. Dennings was in her room<br> that night?<br> Why do you ask?<br> Might she remember?<br> No, she was heavily sedated.<br> It's serious?<br> Yes, I'm afraid it is.<br> May I ask...?<br> We still don't know.<br> Watch out for drafts.<br> A draft in the fall,<br> when the house is hot, is...<br> ...a magic carpet for bacteria.<br> Excuse me, madam. Anything else?<br> No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.<br> It's all right.<br> Why are you asking all this?<br> It's strange.<br> The deceased comes to visit,<br> stays only 20 minutes...<br> ...and leaves all alone a very sick girl.<br> And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil...<br> ...it isn't likely he would fall<br> from a window.<br> Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck<br> what we found.<br> Except maybe one chance in a thousand.<br> No. My hunch....<br> My opinion...<br> ...he was killed by a very powerful man:<br> point one.<br> And the fracturing of his skull: point two...<br> ...plus the various other things<br> we mentioned...<br> ...would make it very probable...<br> ...probable, not certain...<br> ...that the deceased was killed and then<br> pushed from your daughter's window.<br> But nobody was in the room<br> except your daughter, so how can this be?<br> It could be one way.<br> If someone came calling<br> between the time Miss Spencer left...<br> ...and the time you returned.<br> Judas Priest, just a second.<br> The servants? They have visitors?<br> Not at all.<br> You were expecting a package that day,<br> some delivery?<br> Not that I know of.<br> Groceries, cleaning...a package?<br> I really wouldn't know.<br> Karl takes care of all that.<br> I see.<br> Would you like to ask him?<br> No, never mind, it's...<br> ...it's very remote.<br> No, never mind.<br> Would you like some more coffee?<br> Please.<br> That's cute.<br> Your daughter, she's the artist?<br> Thank you.<br> Incidentally...<br> ...you might ask your daughter...<br> ...if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings<br> in her room that night.<br> Look, he wouldn't have any reason<br> in the world to go up to her room.<br> I know, I realize, but...<br> ...if certain British doctors never asked,<br> "What is this fungus?"...<br> ...we wouldn't today have penicillin.<br> Correct?<br> When she's better, I'll ask her.<br> It couldn't hurt.<br> In the meantime....<br> That's okay.<br> I really hate to ask you this, but...<br> ...for my daughter,<br> could you please give an autograph?<br> Of course. Where's a pencil?<br> Right here.<br> She'd love it!<br> What's her name?<br> I lied. It's for me.<br> The spelling is on the back: Kinderman.<br> You know that film you made, Angel?.<br> I saw that six times!<br> Really?<br> It was beautiful.<br> Thank you.<br> You're a very nice lady.<br> -Thank you.<br> -You're a nice man.<br> I'll come back when she's feeling better.<br> -'Bye.<br> -'Bye.<br> Please, no!<br> -Do it!<br> -Please, don't!<br> You bitch! Do it!<br> Please, no!<br> Let Jesus fuck you!<br> Let Jesus fuck you!<br> Give it! Give it to me!<br> Lick me! Lick me!<br> Mrs. MacNeil, open the door!<br> Do you know what she did,<br> your cunting daughter?<br> Chris MacNeil?<br> Please go away.<br> I'm Father Karras.<br> I'm very sorry. Hello.<br> I should have told you<br> I wouldn't be in uniform.<br> Yeah, that would have helped.<br> Have you got a cigarette, Father?<br> Thanks.<br> Cold.<br> How did a shrink ever get to be a priest?<br> It's the other way around. The Society<br> sent me through medical school.<br> Where?<br> Harvard, Bellevue...<br> ...Johns Hopkins. Places like that.<br> -You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?<br> -Yes, I am.<br> -Pretty close?<br> -Pretty close.<br> Did he talk to you about my party?<br> He sure did.<br> About my daughter?<br> No, I didn't know you had one.<br> -He didn't mention her?<br> -No.<br> He didn't tell you what she did?<br> He didn't mention her.<br> Priests are pretty tight-mouthed then?<br> That depends.<br> -On what?<br> -The priest.<br> I mean, what if a person...<br> ...came to you, you know, that was<br> a murderer or a criminal of some kind...<br> ...and they wanted some kind of help?<br> Would you have to turn them in?<br> Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice,<br> I'd say no.<br> -You wouldn't?<br> -No, I wouldn't.<br> But I would try to convince him<br> to turn himself in.<br> And, how do you go about<br> getting an exorcism?<br> I beg your pardon?<br> If a person's, you know,<br> possessed by a demon, or something...<br> ...how do they get an exorcism?<br> First, I'd have to get them<br> into a time machine...<br> ...and get them back to the 16th century.<br> I didn't get you.<br> It just doesn't happen anymore,<br> Mrs. MacNeil.<br> Oh, yes? Since when?<br> Since we learned about mental illness,<br> paranoia, schizophrenia.<br> All those things they taught me at Harvard.<br> Mrs. MacNeil,<br> since the day I joined the Jesuits...<br> ...l've never met one priest<br> who has performed an exorcism. Not one.<br> Yeah, well...<br> ...it just so happens<br> that somebody very close to me...<br> ...is probably possessed.<br> And needs an exorcist.<br> Father Karras, it's my little girl.<br> Then that's all the more reason<br> to forget about exorcism.<br> Why? I don't understand.<br> To begin with, it could make things worse.<br> How?<br> Secondly, the Church,<br> before it approves an exorcism...<br> ...conducts an investigation<br> to see if it's warranted.<br> That takes time.<br> -You could do it yourself.<br> -No, I couldn't.<br> I'd need Church approval,<br> and that's rarely given.<br> Could you see her?<br> Yes, I could.<br> I could see her as a psychiatrist--<br> Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest!<br> She's seen every fucking psychiatrist<br> in the world...<br> ...and they sent me to you!<br> Are you gonna send me back to them?<br> Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?<br> You don't understand--<br> Can't you help her? Just help her!<br> It wants no straps.<br> Hello, Regan.<br> I'm a friend of your mother's.<br> I'd like to help you.<br> You might loosen these straps, then.<br> I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan.<br> I'm not Regan.<br> I see.<br> Well, then, let's introduce ourselves.<br> I'm Damien Karras.<br> And I am the devil.<br> Now kindly undo these straps.<br> If you're the devil,<br> why not make the straps disappear?<br> That's much too vulgar<br> a display ofpower, Karras.<br> Where's Regan?<br> In here, with us.<br> Show me Regan<br> and I'll loosen one of the straps.<br> Could you help an old altar boy, Father?<br> Your mother is in here with us, Karras.<br> Would you like to leave a message?<br> I'll see that she gets it.<br> If that's true...<br> ...then you must know<br> my mother's maiden name.<br> What is it?<br> What is it?<br> Thank you.<br> Look, I'm only against the possibility<br> of doing her more harm than good.<br> Nothing you could do<br> could make it any worse.<br> I can't do it.<br> I need evidence that the Church<br> would accept as signs of possession.<br> Like what?<br> Her speaking in a language<br> she's never known or studied.<br> What else?<br> I don't know. I'd have to look it up.<br> I thought you were supposed<br> to be an expert.<br> There are no experts.<br> You probably know as much<br> about possession as most priests.<br> Your daughter doesn't say she's a demon.<br> She says she's the devil himself.<br> If you've seen as many psychotics<br> as I have, you'd realize...<br> ...that's the same as saying<br> you're Napoleon Bonaparte.<br> You asked me what I think<br> is best for your daughter.<br> Six months under observation...<br> ...in the best hospital you can find.<br> You show me Regan's double...<br> ...same face, same voice, everything...<br> ...and I'd know it wasn't Regan.<br> I'd know in my gut.<br> I'm telling you that that thing upstairs<br> isn't my daughter.<br> I want you to tell me<br> that you know for a fact...<br> ...there's nothing wrong with my daughter<br> except in her mind!<br> Tell me you know for a fact<br> that an exorcism wouldn't do any good!<br> You tell me that!<br> Did Regan know a priest was coming over?<br> No.<br> Did you know my mother died recently?<br> Yes, I did. I'm very sorry.<br> Is Regan aware of it?<br> Not at all.<br> Why do you ask?<br> It's not important. Good night.<br> Hello, Daddy?<br> This is me.<br> -What should I say anyway?<br> -Just talk to your daddy.<br> Tell him what you've been doing<br> and how you're feeling.<br> I hope you can hear me.<br> Can you hear me okay?<br> He's not going to answer you.<br> Talk to your daddy, honey.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> Well, let's see. First we.... No....<br> Wait. I don't know.<br> -Tell him about Washington.<br> -Okay.<br> You see, we're in Washington now,<br> Daddy, and....<br> "He broke the bread,<br> and gave it to his disciples and said:<br> "'Take this, all of you, and eat it.<br> "'For this is my body.'<br> "When the supper was ended,<br> he took the cup.<br> "Again he gave you thanks and praise.<br> "He gave the cup to his disciples and said:<br> 'Take this...<br> "'...all of you, and drink from it.<br> "'This is the cup of my blood.<br> "'The blood of the new and everlasting<br> Covenant, the mystery of faith."'<br> What an excellent day for an exorcism.<br> You'd like that?<br> Intensely.<br> But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?<br> It would bring us together.<br> You and Regan?<br> You and us.<br> Did you do that?<br> Do it again.<br> In time.<br> No, now.<br> In time.<br> Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?<br> You speak Latin?<br> Ego te absolvo.<br> Quod nomen mihi est?<br> Bonjour!<br> Quod nomen mihi est?<br> La plume de ma tante.<br> How long are you planning<br> to stay in Regan?<br> Until she rots<br> and lies stinking in the earth.<br> What's that?<br> Holy water.<br> You keep it away!<br> It burns!<br> Oh, it burns!<br> Who are you?<br> You know, I'm like in seclusion.<br> No, I'm just exhausted from work.<br> She's, she's all right.<br> I don't want to talk about it, okay?<br> Okay, I'll talk to you.<br> I'll call as soon as it's over, all right?<br> No, I just, I'm going through something<br> and I just have to....<br> No, no....<br> There's nothing.<br> Hey, thanks a lot.<br> -Want a drink?<br> -Please.<br> What do you drink?<br> Scotch.<br> Ice and water.<br> No ice. I'll get some from the kitchen.<br> That's all right. I'll take it straight.<br> Please sit.<br> Where's her father?<br> In Europe.<br> -Have you told him what's happening?<br> -No.<br> Well, I think you should.<br> I told Regan that was holy water.<br> I sprinkled it on her<br> and she reacted very violently.<br> It's tap water.<br> What's the difference?<br> Holy water is blessed. And that doesn't<br> help support a case for possession.<br> She killed Burke Dennings.<br> What?<br> She killed Burke Dennings.<br> She pushed him out her window.<br> No one.<br> Who are you?<br> No one!<br> It's a language, all right. It's English.<br> What do you mean?<br> It's English in reverse. Listen.<br> Give us time.<br> Let her die.<br> I am no one. I am no one.<br> Fear the priest.<br> Fear the priest.<br> Merrin!<br> I am no one.<br> Merrin! Fear the priest!<br> Merrin!<br> Yeah?<br> I'll be right there.<br> I don't want Chris to see this.<br> What's wrong? What is it?<br> You're convinced that it's genuine?<br> I don't know.<br> No, not really, I suppose.<br> But I have made...<br> ...a prudent judgement that it meets<br> the conditions set down in The Ritual.<br> You would want to do<br> the exorcism yourself?.<br> Yes.<br> It might be best to have a man<br> with experience.<br> Someone who's spent time<br> in the foreign missions.<br> I understand, Your Excellency.<br> Let's see who's around.<br> In the meantime,<br> I'll call you as soon as I know.<br> Thank you, Your Excellency.<br> Well, he does know the background.<br> I doubt there's any danger<br> in just having him assist.<br> There should be<br> a psychiatrist present, anyway.<br> What about the exorcist?<br> Have you any ideas?<br> How about Lankester Merrin?<br> I had a notion he was in lraq.<br> I read he was working<br> on a dig near Nineveh.<br> You're right, but he's finished.<br> He came back three or four months ago.<br> He's at Woodstock now.<br> What's he doing there, teaching?<br> He's working on another book.<br> Don't you think he's too old, Tom?<br> How's his health?<br> He must be all right.<br> He's still running around digging up tombs.<br> -Besides, he's had experience.<br> -I didn't know that.<br> Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa.<br> The exorcism supposedly lasted months.<br> I heard it damn near killed him.<br> Father?<br> -You're Mrs. MacNeil?<br> -Yes.<br> I'm Father Merrin.<br> Come in.<br> Thank you.<br> -Is Father Karras here?<br> -Yes. He's here already.<br> It's an honor to meet you, Father.<br> -Are you very tired?<br> -No.<br> I'd like you to go quickly<br> across to the Residence...<br> ...and gather up a cassock for myself...<br> ...two surplices, a purple stole,<br> and some holy water...<br> ...and...<br> ...your copy of The Roman Ritual.<br> The large one.<br> I believe we should begin.<br> Do you want to hear the background<br> of the case first, Father?<br> Why?<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> You're welcome.<br> Would you like some brandy<br> in that, Father?<br> The doctors say I shouldn't.<br> But thank God...<br> ...my will is weak.<br> Especially important is the warning<br> to avoid conversations with the demon.<br> We may ask what is relevant,<br> but anything beyond that is dangerous.<br> He's a liar.
