Super Chief.<br> Around the corner.<br> No, I left my dog<br> here this morning.<br> Regular hours are 8 to 5.<br> I know. I was passing and thought<br> I'd drop by and see him.<br> You can check on him,<br> tomorrow between 8 and 5.<br> I thought I could just...<br> We are not communicating<br> here, are we?<br> You want to know<br> if he's okay, right?<br> Yeah.<br> - Alright. Hold on.<br> - The name is Baker.<br> Save it! What's he look like?<br> Black. Lab.<br> The dead ones are in the cold room.<br> No, just a couple of poodles.<br> I want my dog.<br> - Listen, get out of here.<br> - No, you listen you little fuck.<br> Off your ass, get my dog or I'll<br> stick the magazine down your throat.<br> - We communicating now?<br> - Yeah, all right.<br> Baker, right?<br> How about a little light?<br> Eddie!<br> Forget it.

Pictures.<br> Welcome to the road, Dorothy.<br> You're about to lose your virginity.<br> Why, thank you.<br> I'll see you boys inside.<br> I took the right<br> side of the closet.<br> Since my bed's on the right,<br> I think it makes sense.<br> - Right.<br> - We'll do the drawers the same.<br> Unless you want the right.<br> No, you take the right.<br> Looks like Carmen Miranda<br> had an accident in my room.<br> They must get a deal on these.<br> What do you make of this?<br> Kiwi.<br> It's got more hair than you, Frank.<br> No peeking at tub time.<br> What the hell is this?<br> Do you hear this?<br> I do now.<br> Great! Before we play a note,<br> we're gonna get thrown out.<br> So she's playing a little music.<br> She's got the Harry James<br> Orchestra in there!<br> Ellington.<br> Frank!<br> What?<br> You're looking a little tense.<br> Of course! It's 2 AM and she's<br> going to wake up everyone!<br> See?<br> Massage?<br> Down here, gorgeous.<br> I figured you for jockeys.<br> New socks?<br> The look<br> Of love<br> Is in<br> Your eyes<br> A look<br> Your smile can't disguise<br> The look<br> Of love<br> Is saying so much more<br> Than just words could ever say<br> And what my heart has heard<br> Well, it takes my breath away<br> I can hardly wait to hold you<br> Feel my arms around you<br> How long I have waited<br> Waited just to love you<br> Now that I have found you<br> Don't ever go<br> Don't ever go-oh-oh<br> Don't ever go<br> I love you so<br> Mark my words.<br> From this night forward,<br> our lives will never be the same.<br> Frank, you get a lot of pop out<br> of two glasses of champagne.<br> Long way from "Hula<br> Girl Hideaway", eh?<br> Remember? Banana<br> trees in the lobby.<br> Takahama's Tahitian.<br> Did we play there?<br> - I thought we stopped for teriyaki.<br> - Three nights.<br> It's amazing. He can remember<br> ever place we ever played.<br> The day, the month, the year,<br> how many shows, you name it.<br> When was Takahama's?<br> August '74.<br> See? He's brilliant.<br> Really!<br> Brilliant!<br> Hey, Jack.<br> You are brilliant.<br> Thanks.<br> It's the same with music.<br> Should've seen him as a kid.<br> Nobody could ride<br> the keys like Jack.<br> Mrs. Simpson played something<br> once, and he had it.<br> Really?<br> I never won a single blue<br> ribbon until the day Jack<br> showed up drunk at spring<br> recital and played<br> "One O'clock Jump" instead<br> of "Clare de Lune".<br> The mood just hit me.<br> "Moonglow".<br> - "Moonglow"?<br> - High school. I couldn't dance.<br> Jack did the box step<br> with me for a week.<br> It wasn't a week.<br> - You two are that close?<br> - He paid me.<br> It was my first social with Donna.<br> We fell in love on the dance floor.<br> I have a beautiful wife,<br> two beautiful children,<br> all because of my brother.<br> You overestimate the box step.<br> It was just like this,<br> on our honeymoon.<br> The moon, the stars.<br> Remember, Jack?<br> I wasn't there.<br> Right.<br> My first solo gig.<br> God, she was gorgeous.<br> I couldn't believe she was mine.<br> How come I got so lucky, Jack?<br> You're a lucky guy.<br> You know?<br> I never kissed my wife<br> on New Year's Eve.<br> I'm always on stage somewhere.<br> I think I'm drunk.<br> You two dance.<br> I'm gonna...<br> go sit with the wallflowers.<br> I'm not used to leading.<br> Come on, give the girl a glide.<br> No. I think your little brother<br> prefers to dance alone.<br> No, thanks.<br> I never touch French cigarettes.<br> Your brother's a good dancer.<br> Big heartbreaker.<br> A couple of turns, that was it.<br> Really?<br> Got them right in the knees.<br> Practically had to carry<br> the girls off the floor.<br> Really?<br> Have another drink, Frank.<br> No, I'm sleepy.<br> Go to sleep then.<br> Alright.<br> I think I just lost my chaperone.<br> You're safe.<br> So where do you keep your<br> blue ribbons, Mr. Baker?<br> Frank keeps them.<br> Nice night, huh?<br> It's quiet, it's like...<br> the whole world is asleep.<br> Careful.<br> I had too much to drink.<br> Champagne goes right to my head.<br> - Maybe we should call it a night.<br> - Yeah.<br> Miss Diamond!<br> These just arrived for you.<br> Looks like you have an admirer.<br> There's no card.<br> The gentleman said he would<br> be in contact with you.<br> He's with the cat food convention.<br> I can have put them in water.<br> No, that's alright.<br> It's nice.<br> It's nice.<br> It's been 5 years since I've<br> seen you without a cigarette.<br> The whole room upstairs<br> smells like an ashtray.<br> You know that? The sheets,<br> the carpets, the drapes.<br> The towels, my tux, my shirt.<br> Want to smell my shirt?<br> Maybe later.<br> I'm not kidding. Do you know<br> what an insidious habit that is?<br> How many do you smoke a day?<br> Must be hundreds!<br> This is just a wild stab, but<br> is something bothering you?<br> Leave her alone.<br> I mean it.<br> This isn't a hatcheck girl you can<br> leave behind at the Sheraton.<br> You've got two shows<br> a night with her.<br> You don't know what you're saying.<br> I know trouble, and it's<br> name starts with 'S'.<br> Do me a favor, Frank. Relax.<br> Do me a favor, little brother.<br> Stick to cocktail waitresses.<br> Meeting here each night,<br> sharing these few moments,<br> I feel as if we're becoming<br> one big happy family.<br> The fine wine, the music...<br> What's all this mean?<br> I don't know. Who's to say?<br> All I can tell you is...<br> it makes it very<br> special for us here...<br> to have you out there.<br> Right, Susie?<br> Right, Frank.<br> Right, Jack?<br> Right.<br> But if I can add one more thing.<br> I love you, Frank.<br> What?<br> I love you.<br> I just wanted to say it.<br> You came in late on<br> "Little Green Apples".<br> - Excuse me?<br> - You heard me.<br> No, Frank.<br> You came in early.<br> - You have for the past decade.<br> - I never missed a beat.<br> I never miss the beat!<br> That's because you make it up.<br> Take it back.<br> Take it back?<br> What's this, the 3rd grade?<br> Take it back!<br> Take a kiwi, Frank.<br> Go to bed, Frank,<br> or this will get ugly.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah, come on.<br> It's the fucking Newlywed Game.<br> - You hit me.<br> - I told you I was going to.<br> Hello? Yeah.<br> No, this is 512-B.<br> Mr. Baker is in 512-A.<br> Urgent.<br> No, never mind. I'll get him.<br> We made a deal.<br> Training wheels for a<br> month, then we would see.<br> He ran into somebody's car?<br> Mrs. Ramadino's station wagon. It wasn't<br> moving. It was parked down the street.<br> Barely made it out of the driveway.<br> Got a pencil? Pencil anybody?<br> Here.<br> I want you to take down<br> the New Year show.<br> "Thanks for the Memories".<br> - Then you segue into...<br> - "Happy Days Are Here Again".<br> - I know the show.<br> - Then the song from Camelot.<br> Don't hesitate to call.<br> Come on.<br> Any word from Egghead?<br> I saved you the crossword.<br> Thanks.<br> Well, happy reading.<br> Hear anything yet?<br> Not a peep.<br> I'm going to take a bath.<br> Yeah?<br> It's Frank.<br> So how's little Frank?<br> Good. That's a relief.<br> No, I understand.<br> Call me when you have time.<br> What are you doing?<br> We're taking a bath.<br> I mean...<br> Susie's taking a bath.<br> I'm doing the crossword puzzle.<br> Okay.<br> Bye.<br> Kid's in the pink.<br> Good.<br> Another bride<br> Another June<br> Another sunny<br> Honeymoon<br> Another season<br> Another reason...<br> For makin' whoopee<br> A lot of shoes<br> A lot of rice<br> The groom is nervous<br> He answers twice<br> It's really killing<br> That he's so willing<br> To make whoopee<br> Picture a little love nest<br> Down where the roses cling<br> Picture that same sweet love nest<br> Think what a year can bring<br> He's washin' dishes<br> And baby clothes<br> He's so ambitious<br> He even sews<br> But don't forget, folks<br> That's what you get, folks<br> For makin' whoopee<br> For makin' whoopee<br> For makin' whoopee<br> For makin'<br> Whoopee<br> Boys and girls, find a friend.<br> This is it!<br> Ten, nine, eight, seven...<br> six, five, four, three...<br> two, one...<br> So...<br> make any resolutions?<br> No. You?<br> No. I figure that stuff is<br> a bunch of crap anyway.<br> - You do what you do, right?<br> - That's right.<br> Old Egghead would've blown a<br> gasket seeing us here tonight!<br> You're good, aren't you?<br> I can carry a tune.<br> You're better than that.<br> I saw you guys once.<br> You and Frank.<br> At the Roosevelt.<br> Must've been a cheap date.<br> Soap convention.<br> Soap?<br> Yeah, they got a<br> convention for everything.<br> The guy was some<br> big roller in suds.<br> At least he was clean.<br> Some guys you wouldn't believe.<br> The older ones,<br> they weren't so bad.<br> Nice. Polite.<br> Pulled you chair out for you.<br> But the younger ones...<br> It wasn't so bad.<br> I'd get a nice piece of steak,<br> flowers, sometimes even a gift.<br> Usually whatever the guy was into.<br> I got a set of socket<br> wrenches once.<br> Guy looked at me like he'd<br> given me 4 dozen roses.<br> But I stayed at the<br> Hartford one time.<br> You should see the rooms.<br> All satin and velvet.<br> And the bed...<br> royal blue, trimmed in<br> lace clean as snow.<br> Hard to believe a room like<br> that don't change your life.<br> But it don't.<br> The bed may be magic,<br> but the mirror isn't.<br> Still wake up the same old Susie.<br> I didn't always.<br> You know, I mean...<br> if I liked the guy.<br> I never liked the<br> Hartford much myself.<br> My neck, it's so tight.<br> Usually singing relaxes me.<br> But tonight...<br> Thanks.<br> You'd make a hell of a<br> fireman, you know that?<br> Do you practice that at<br> home with a stopwatch?<br> I didn't want to wake you.<br> I'm an early riser.<br> I didn't expect you to buy<br> be a corsage this morning.<br> Your high school ring is safe.<br> Shit!<br> Shit!<br> That takes care of<br> the week of the 5th.<br> After that, we got the Avedon<br> or the Plaza, 4 day turn.<br> What do you think, Jack?<br> You with me, Jack?<br> The Avedon's a dump.<br> There's no cover, no minimum.<br> They water their drinks.<br> Strictly the Fuller Brush crowd.<br> It's not that bad. Besides,<br> Blacky Carson books the Avedon.<br> He's always been good to us.<br> - He hasn't been that good.<br> - Okay, we'll take the Plaza.<br> - Then the Capri for 5 days.<br> - Not the Luau Lounge again.<br> What the matter?<br> They don't salt their peanuts?<br> Singing "Feelings",<br> knee-deep in paper orchids<br> and plastic Tiki lamps<br> is not my idea of a fun evening.<br> Fun? Who promised you fun?<br> We get paid, remember?<br> I'm saying, maybe we<br> should vote on it.<br> Maybe we should ask<br> Jack what he thinks.<br> I don't have to.<br> I know what he thinks.<br> It's 5 days, the money's green.<br> We're there.<br> Speaking about "Feelings",<br> you might brush up on the lyrics.<br> The other night, you sang<br> the first verse twice.<br> Really?<br> That explains the gasps I<br> heard from the audience.<br> We trashed the Avedon, the Luau.<br> What's your beef with "Feelings"?<br> Nothing.<br> Except, who cares?<br> Does anybody really<br> need to hear "Feelings"<br> again in a lifetime?<br> It's like parsley.<br> Take it away, nobody<br> knows the difference.<br> "Feelings" isn't parsley.<br> To you, "Feelings"<br> may be filet mignon.<br> To me, it's parsley.<br> Less than parsley.<br> Look, "Feelings", despite<br> what you think of it,<br> is always a bright moment<br> and a crowd-pleaser.<br> Consequently, we have an<br> obligation to perform it.<br> The audience would be disappointed.<br> They weren't crying<br> on New Year's Eve.<br> You passed over "Feelings"?<br> Yeah.<br> And...<br> "Bali Hai" went out with<br> the bath water, too.<br> I see.<br> The cat goes away and the<br> mice take over the orchestra.<br> Hey,<br> I ain't no mouse.<br> That's right. You're parsley.<br> This food's been sitting here<br> too long. It's making me sick.<br> Why don't you loosen the leash?<br> Let's not let a whiff of perfume<br> blow off 15 years. Be reasonable.<br> I play 300 nights a year with you.<br> Is that reasonable enough?<br> Can I have a double vodka, please?<br> I was in the neighborhood.<br> Listen, don't get nervous.<br> I just came by to...<br> talk.<br> I guess you found him, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> I came to walk Eddie.<br> Come.<br> Terry's Tap Room.<br> First gig we ever played.<br> The owner gave us that bottle,<br> but wouldn't open it.<br> How come?<br> Told us to save it.<br> He said someday it would soften<br> the edges of the bad times.<br> And make the good ones<br> seem even better.<br> We should've drunk it before<br> we played Terry's Tap Room.<br> Want some coffee?<br> You want to leave?<br> Listen.<br> The reason I came last night is...<br> I'm thinking about leaving.<br> The act.<br> I met this guy at New<br> Year's at the Hotel.<br> And he liked my voice.<br> He thinks I can sell cat food<br> just by singing about it.<br> It's crazy, huh?<br> Take it.<br> I haven't decided yet.<br> I'm just thinking about it.<br> No, take it.<br> How long have you been taking<br> care of the kid upstairs?<br> I don't take care of her.<br> Didn't look that way to me.<br> What's the difference?<br> Anyway, I know Frank has<br> us booked through March.<br> Don't worry about Frank.<br> What about you?<br> What's that to do with anything?<br> Nothing. I don't want to leave<br> you guys with an empty mike.<br> There's always another girl.<br> Right.<br> Thanks for the advice.<br> I'll think it over.<br> Teardrops<br> Falling down on my face<br> Trying to forget my<br> Feelings of love<br> Feelings<br> For all my life I'll feel it<br> I wish I'd never met you, boy<br> You'll never come again<br> I told Frank I'm quitting.<br> Congratulations.<br> As of now.<br> If you need a recommendation,<br> you let me know.<br> Jesus you're cold! You know that?<br> You are like a fucking razor blade.<br> Careful, you'll have me thinking<br> you're going soft on me.<br> You don't give a fuck, do you?<br> About anything.<br> What do you want from me?<br> To tell you to stay?<br> Beg on my knees for you to<br> save the Baker Boys from doom?<br> Forget it, sweetheart.<br> We survived for 15 years before<br> you strutted on the scene.<br> Two seconds and you're<br> bawling like a baby.<br> You should be wearing a<br> diaper, not a dress.<br> You and he are<br> brothers, aren't you?<br> Let me tell you something.<br> They've dropped like flies.<br> We're still here!<br> We've never held a day<br> job in our lives.<br> He's an easy target,<br> but add it up, he's done fine.<br> Yeah, Frank has done great.<br> He has the wife, kids,<br> little house in the suburbs.<br> While his brother lives a shitty<br> apartment with a sick dog,<br> Little Orphan Annie and a chip on<br> his shoulder size of a Cadillac.<br> Listen, Princess. We<br> fucked twice, that's it.<br> Once the sweat dries, you<br> still know shit about me.<br> I know one thing. While<br> Frank put his kids to bed,<br> little brother Jack was<br> dusting off his dreams.<br> I was there.<br> I saw it in your face.<br> You're full of shit.<br> You're a fake.<br> Every time you walk<br> in those places,<br> you're selling yourself cheap.<br> I know all about that.<br> I find myself at the end of the night<br> with some creep, and I tell<br> myself it doesn't matter.<br> You kid yourself you've got this<br> empty place inside to put it.<br> But do it long enough<br> and all you are is empty.<br> I didn't know whores<br> were so philosophical.<br> At least my brother's not my pimp.<br> I had you pegged for a loser<br> the first time I saw you.<br> But you're worse.<br> You're a coward.<br> My name is Frank Baker<br> and you know my brother Jack.<br> My brother and I have been<br> playing together for...<br> I don't know.<br> Jack?<br> But of course, back then...<br> it was a little different.<br> We were just kids.<br> The only one who'd listen to<br> us was the family cat, Cecil.<br> We must've shaved two<br> lives off that cat, huh?<br> Sorry.<br> We're not getting paid then.<br> I told you, it's a telethon.<br> No one gets a cent.<br> What's it for?<br> I don't know, some disease.<br> What channel is it on?<br> A channel, just a little further<br> down the dial. It's publicity.<br> Publicity's publicity, right?<br> Right.<br> I'll see when we're on.<br> What's wrong with the kid.<br> Tore his knee playing St Joseph's<br> just before the accident.<br> Accident?<br> The fire.<br> Rate we're going, we'll be lucky to<br> buy jockstraps, let alone a gym.<br> Earl the pearl!<br> We're on after Mr. Basketball.<br> - Are you fucking kidding me?<br> - What?<br> We're playing for a<br> God damn gymnasium.<br> Let's hear it for Jimmy Marshall.<br> Most of you know Jimmy<br> twisted that knee<br> trying to win one for good<br> old Lahuga High this year.<br> Luckily, the doctors tell us that<br> Jimmy will play next season.<br> That's where you come in.<br> Pick up the phone.
