                        Good day, sir.<br> In his office there, miss.<br> Uh, Baines, is, uh... -<br> is the ambassador's car at the door?<br> - It's waiting, sir.<br> - His Excellency has been delayed.<br> He'll drive straight to the airport.<br> Of course.<br> Oh, uh, Baines, flowers for her room.<br> You know the sort my wife likes. After eight months<br> in a hospital the place must look like home.<br> She'll find everything<br> just as she left it, sir.<br> The doctors don't yet know<br> if they'll permit her to fly.<br> - The journey will be a strain.<br> - Master Phillipe, sir.<br> He should have his hair cut.<br> He looks as if we've neglected him.<br> - Any message for your mother, Phillipe?<br> - Tell her I've got something to show her.<br> That will bring her home.<br> Look after the embassy while I'm away.<br> Be back on Monday morning<br> with my wife, I hope.<br> I hope so too, Your Excellency.<br> It's been a long time.<br> Papa. Papa.<br> Au revoir, Papa.<br> Hello, Macgregor.<br> Aw.<br> Hello, Macgregor. Hello.<br> Come on. Come on. Hmm.<br> Come on.<br> Oh.<br> Look. London.<br> Good day, sir.<br> Baines.<br> Baines!<br> - One of her moods again.<br> - Always some grouse.<br> Not healthy to be as clean as all that.<br> You be careful, sonny.<br> Mrs. Baines is on the warpath again.<br> Anyway, these foreigners like a bit of dirt.<br> Poor kid. Be a good thing<br> for him when his mother gets back.<br> Master Phillipe, just because<br> your father's away for a couple of days...<br> you mustn't think<br> you can run wild all over the house.<br> - No, Mrs. Baines.<br> - I've got plenty to do without clearing up after you.<br> What's that you've got in your hand?<br> Show me. What is it?<br> Piece of chalk.<br> You've been making marks<br> all over the floor again?<br> - Well? Have you?<br> - Just little marks.<br> Give me the chalk.<br> Come on. Give it to me.<br> Have you done what<br> I told you to do, Master Phillipe?<br> Done what?<br> - Got rid of it.<br> - Yes.<br> You know what happens<br> to little boys who tell lies?<br> I won't have any vermin<br> in any house I run.<br> Did you put it where I told you to?<br> Down the lavatory?<br> - Did you? Answer me. Did you?<br> - Yes.<br> What are you hiding in your pockets?<br> Bring your hand out.<br> Show me. Come along.<br> Only toffees.<br> I won't have you eating between meals,<br> Master Phillipe. Give them to me.<br> You need a mother's care.<br> I've tried to do it for months.<br> Is that all you've got? Run along,<br> and try and not get into mischief.<br> It's difficult enough<br> with half the staff away.<br> - See you on Monday, Mr. Baines.<br> - Have a good weekend, Harry.<br> Get out of it.<br> Can't you see I'm busy?<br> Can't you pick on someone else?<br> Well, since you are here,<br> you might as well do a job of work.<br> - Get on with that.<br> - Look. Macgregor.<br> Oh. Hmm.<br> Looking well this morning, isn't he?<br> - Have you got a little box for him?<br> - Little box?<br> - Hmm. Might find something.<br> - Will you take me for a walk this afternoon, Baines?<br> Well, I might, if you work hard enough.<br> I might. We'll see.<br> Quite a lot to be done.<br> This is exciting... -<br> your mother coming back... - isn't it?<br> Yes, but, you know,<br> I don't remember her very well.<br> Have a glass of pop, Phile. Spot of drink<br> will do us good. Give us an appetite for dinner.<br> - I am having my meals down here, aren't I?<br> - Of course.<br> - What have you got for chop?<br> - Chop?<br> You said that was<br> what food was called in Africa.<br> - Oh, yes, of course. Chop.<br> - Tell me more about Africa.<br> - Another time.<br> - Was is it hot there?<br> You never felt such heat.<br> Not... - Not even where you come from.<br> Not a nice heat, mind you,<br> like you get in the park on a day like this.<br> The white man's grave, they call it.<br> Wet. Smelling of rot.<br> - What does rot smell of?<br> - Eh?<br> Oh, the opposite to this.<br> I smell that carbolic stuff.<br> When there's nothing<br> but carbolic round you hanker after rot.<br> Mmm. I understand.<br> - Hmm.<br> - It reeks of chains.<br> Yes. Hmm.<br> - It's a man's life out there, Phile.<br> - But why did you leave Africa?<br> Why? Oh, um,<br> get married, you know.<br> Wasn't there anybody to marry<br> out there in Africa?<br> Oh, yes. Plenty.<br> But they weren't white.<br> - Must they be white?<br> - Um... - Hmm.<br> Ah, Mrs. Patterson.<br> What are you doing with those?<br> - Mrs. Baines told us to fill 'em.<br> - Where's Dolly and the others?<br> The weekend off. The place is empty except for<br> Mrs. Baines, Phile and me. We carry on.<br> - Phile, drink up the pop and lend a hand with this.<br> - Don't overwork him, Mr. Baines.<br> Got to make a living like everybody else.<br> - Does everybody make a living?<br> - Everybody.<br> - Even Papa?<br> - Just a slave really.<br> - Not an easy life like us.<br> - Can you make a living in Africa?<br> Make a living? You can make a fortune.<br> Make anything you like.<br> Make elephants and kings and castles.<br> Yes. And shoot 'em too.<br> - If they don't get you.<br> - Can I show her the gun?<br> Don't you dare. Leave it where it is.<br> It's not loaded,<br> and Baines keeps the safety catch on.<br> Leave it be, Phile.<br> - It's got bullets too!<br> - Phile... -<br> Phile.<br> So there you are.<br> Holding up the work again?<br> - There's still plenty to do.<br> - We'll get it finished.<br> - By sitting around here all day long?<br> - Good morning, Mr. Baines. Till Monday.<br> - Ta, ta.<br> - No business to keep that gun in the house.<br> Come along, Master Phillipe.<br> Sit down there. Get on to that salad.<br> Baines is going to take me<br> for a walk this afternoon.<br> No, he isn't.<br> Not with all this work to do.<br> - There'll be time enough for both.<br> - Oh, please.<br> Work first,<br> and pleasure afterwards.<br> Easy to see you've been eating<br> between meals, Master Phillipe.<br> - I'm sick to death of your ways, spoiling the boy.<br> - He didn't. I took it.<br> - Lying again, Master Phillipe?<br> - There's lies and lies.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> - Some lies are just kindness.<br> Kindness?<br> Temper, temper. I won't have you<br> swearing in front of the boy.<br> - Do go on, Master Phillipe. What are you waiting for?<br> - I don't want any.<br> Master Phillipe, do as you're told<br> and eat it up. Go along.<br> Why don't you let Baines<br> take me for a walk?<br> Because I say so.<br> I hate you.<br> Master Phillipe,<br> you'll say you're sorry for that.<br> I'm not sorry.<br> Very well. Go straight upstairs to the nursery,<br> and you'll stay there for the whole afternoon.<br> Do you hear me?<br> Go along. Up, up, up!<br> Get along with you. Go along.<br> I don't care.<br> Hello, Macgregor.<br> Look. You're very pretty, you know.<br> Baines!<br> Baines!<br> Quick. Come on, Macgregor.<br> I got you.<br> Ah!<br> - Baines!<br> - Mustn't come in here, sonny.<br> - Isn't Mr. Baines here?<br> - No. Hasn't been in here yet.<br> Baines!<br> Phile.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I saw you through the window.<br> Are you by yourself?<br> Yes.<br> You gave me a start.<br> - I thought it would be funny.<br> - Yes. It's funny. Of course it's funny.<br> - Phile, this is Julie.<br> - How do you do?<br> Have a bun.<br> He spells his name queer.<br> P-H-I-L-E. Phile.<br> Oh, she... - she hasn't got an appetite, isn't eating.<br> You can have both of them.<br> You don't need to take any notice of us.<br> - Got a glass of milk?<br> - I think I've got a drop.<br> Well, go and get it, Phile.<br> I wish I were dead.<br> It wouldn't work.<br> There are things have got to be said.<br> If you'd like another cake, you can<br> go to the counter and change it, Phile.<br> No.<br> This is how I see it, Julie.<br> This, uh, girl you're talking about.<br> This, uh... -<br> This friend of yours.<br> She... - She... likes the fellow,<br> doesn't she?<br> It's real, I mean?<br> L 'amour?<br> L 'amour ternel.<br> The things you say, Julie.<br> The way you put things.<br> What I mean is you...<br> can't break a thing like that.<br> Not just by going away,<br> leaving no trace, going home.<br> She wouldn't be going home.<br> - Home is here.<br> - Her own country I mean.<br> Wouldn't work, Julie.<br> There'd be her,<br> as it were you, and...<br> him, as it were me...<br> and all that distance between them.<br> Like this table.<br> It wouldn't work.<br> He'd go crazy, Julie...<br> hoping every time the post came.<br> Not being able to write.<br> Oh, he'd... - he'd forget.<br> There wouldn't be much to remember.<br> For seven months, ever since she came<br> to the embassy, seeing her every day... -<br> Not speaking because of<br> people looking on.<br> Like this.<br> Give it... - Give it time, Julie.<br> - But it's torture.<br> - What's torture?<br> - What's he say?<br> - He says he's had pain too. It soon goes.<br> But this... girlfriend of yours, Julie.<br> She doesn't have to go away.<br> - While there's life there's hope.<br> - There's always hope.<br> Things happen. Things change.<br> People don't change. He's tied.<br> She wouldn't like him so much<br> if he didn't feel tied.<br> I can't believe it.<br> I can't believe we'll go out of here<br> and say good-bye and never... -<br> - Careful.<br> Have you got a handkerchief?<br> No.<br> No. Have you got one, Phile?<br> She's got something in her eye.<br> - Mine's clean.<br> - Well, let her have it, Phile.<br> Pull the top bit over the other one.<br> That's what I always do.<br> There... - There's nothing<br> fixed yet, is there?<br> The... - The boat I mean.<br> - The day after tomorrow.<br> - Monday?<br> Can I have this one too<br> if you don't want it?<br> They couldn't stand it forever,<br> meeting in tea shops and cinemas.<br> All the difficulties and lies.<br> - He's not that kind of man.<br> - What kind of man is he?<br> Good and kind.<br> - Can't hurt anyone.<br> - What a fool the man is.<br> That's what I think too.<br> - Here's your handkerchief, Phillipe.<br> - I've got to see you tomorrow, Julie.<br> It's no good.<br> You've got to take him home now.<br> Listen. I'll ring you somehow.<br> There's so much I have to say.<br> It's all been said over and over again.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - I don't know what to do.<br> You don't need to do anything.<br> Nothing.<br> She does make a fuss<br> about her friend, doesn't she?<br> Can I have some tea in my milk?<br> It's sad about her friend, isn't it?<br> Is Julie your niece or something?<br> - How much is that, please?<br> - One and eight pence.<br> The cup that cheers.<br> Come on, Phile.<br> I'm sorry I gave you a start.<br> That's all right, Phile.<br> - Is that car a Ford?<br> - I didn't see.<br> Oh, look.<br> There's your niece again.<br> Look. I'll speak to her tonight.<br> I'll say to her, "What's the use?<br> You and I don't get on anymore."<br> And then I'll tell her everything.<br> Perhaps she'll see it.<br> She'll never let you go.<br> She might. Anyway, we've one last day.<br> I must see you tomorrow. Just the last time.<br> I'll telephone you.<br> - Promise?<br> - Baines, it is a Ford.<br> I promise.<br> Oh, look.<br> There's Mrs. Baines on the balcony.<br> Need we go in yet?<br> Listen, Phile. I... -<br> I don't want you... -<br> I don't ask you to say<br> what isn't true, but...<br> there's no need to mention<br> to Mrs. Baines that you metJulie.<br> - Is it a secret?<br> - That's right, Phile. Our secret.<br> You see, Mrs. Baines... -<br> She... - She doesn't likeJulie.<br> It was stupid of me to meet her so near home,<br> but I'd got to see she was all right.<br> Of course you had.<br> You can trust me, Baines.<br> Mrs. Baines'll get it out of you<br> if she can.<br> Oh, I'll never let you down, Baines.<br> Funny, isn't it? Julie working for the embassy<br> and all this time she was your niece.<br> Yes. It's a scream.<br> Need we go in yet?<br> - Come on, Phile.<br> - Take me for a walk in the park.<br> Here. Phile.<br> Give me your handkerchief.<br> It's things like that give secrets away.<br> Isn't it exciting, Baines?<br> Good night, Macgregor.<br> Bonsoir.<br> Oh. What are you doing?<br> just looking.<br> - What at?<br> - Nothing.<br> I suppose you were doing nothing<br> this afternoon... - you and Mr. Baines.<br> - Well?<br> - No.<br> We'll see about that later.<br> Come along now.<br> Off you go.<br> I've got work to do. Come on.<br> Now what are you waiting for?<br> You can see I'm busy, can't you?<br> Get along with you. Downstairs.<br> Hurry up.<br> Come down from there!<br> Get down at once!<br> No. No, don't.<br> No. You wait. Wait, wait, wait.<br> Master Phillipe,<br> come away from there at once.<br> Do I have to come and drag you away?<br> Right. Come here.<br> Do you hear me? Give me your hands.<br> Oh, now look what you've done.<br> And all over my shoes.<br> Dirt. Nothing but dirt.<br> No. No. No, you don't. It stays there.<br> Stay there for your mother to see.<br> Show her the sort of tricks<br> you get up to.<br> - Get along. Don't ever let me find you on there again.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> just for that, you shall have your supper in<br> the nursery. Your tray's downstairs. Go fetch it.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - And no more chatting with Baines.<br> Take your tray and go straight upstairs.<br> I'll fetch it later.<br> She knows we were out,<br> but I haven't told her a thing.<br> just slip along upstairs now, Phile.<br> She told me to fetch my tray.<br> I've got to have it upstairs.<br> There it is.<br> I put Macgregor to bed.<br> She nearly caught me.<br> Phile, I'd say I'm sorry about it.<br> - You know. Lunchtime.<br> - Hmm.<br> If my mother does come back on Monday,<br> it won't make any difference to us, will it?<br> Not a bit.<br> I'm sorry I said I hated you.<br> It's all right.<br> I said you weren't to take him out.<br> I didn't take him out.<br> I brought him home.<br> You went out by the back door...<br> he by the fire escape,<br> and you two met outside.<br> Phile's been out on his own.<br> So have I.<br> I told him he wasn't to go out,<br> and you take him.<br> Oh, don't let's talk about him.<br> - There's something more important.<br> - What could that be?<br> You and I.<br> Go on.<br> Well, I've tried to make a go of it.<br> And so have you.<br> But we only make each other miserable.<br> It's years now since there's been a day<br> without some blessed row.<br> - We can't go on like this.<br> - You want your freedom?<br> You don't want me around anymore.<br> This is something new,<br> this kind of talk.<br> I've thought about it long enough.<br> - And now it's time tell you. Because... -<br> - You go off, and see what happens to me.<br> Oh, don't talk like that.<br> - You do as you say. You and your freedom.<br> You'll feel fine when you read it<br> in the Sunday newspapers.<br> You'll be able to say, "That's me. I did that."<br> That'll make you feel happy.<br> Oh, don't talk so foolish.<br> Oh, go and give the boy his supper.<br> We'll talk about it later.<br> You know your father<br> doesn't like you going out alone.<br> - Funny you should meet Baines, wasn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> He likes wandering about<br> on his own too.<br> - Not much appetite, have you, Master Phillipe?<br> - No, Mrs. Baines.<br> Why don't you try eating some of that<br> nice pudding? You don't eat enough.<br> Don't eat enough to keep a fly alive.<br> No lunch and... -<br> and now no supper, Master Phillipe.<br> So that's why you've lost your appetite,<br> Master Phillipe.<br> Been eating between meals.<br> Buying cream buns again.<br> - That's not what your pocket money is for.<br> - I didn't.<br> Don't lie to me, Master Phillipe. You're going to be<br> a fine worry to your mother when I tell her.<br> I will not put up with any more lies.<br> You're becoming a regular little liar!<br> - I won't put up with any more lies from you!<br> - They gave it to me!<br> - They?<br> - Baines I mean.<br> "They."<br> Oh.<br> So that's it.<br> Yes.<br> You mustn't mind Mrs. Baines,<br> Master Phillipe.<br> She, um... - She lets her tongue<br> run away with her.<br> We have a secret now...<br> you and I...<br> that I know all about them.<br> Can you keep a secret?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good.<br> I suppose she was having tea with him.<br> just tea. No cakes.<br> Is she young?<br> Of course. She's his niece.<br> So that's what he said.<br> The old scoundrel.<br> It's all right. She's not seeing him anymore.<br> Tomorrow she's going away.<br> Is she? Tomorrow.<br> You can keep our secret now?<br> Hmm? Yes?<br> Yes.<br> You do, and I'll get you<br> that 2A Meccano set.<br> Do you want the light up there?<br> He hasn't eaten his supper.<br> Think he'd be hungry after his long walk.<br> Wait till I put on the light.<br> I don't think I want to go on<br> with our talk tonight, if you don't mind.<br> You know when you two<br> were out this afternoon?<br> - What? Me and Phile?<br> - Yes.<br> I thought to myself,<br> "Perhaps I stay indoors too much.<br> I ought to get out more,<br> take some time off."<br> - I've been telling you that for weeks.<br> - Yes. So you have.<br> I think it might be a very good idea.<br> You asleep, Phile?<br> Come on, Phile. Time to wake up.<br> Come on, Phile. Up you get.<br> Where's Mrs. Baines?<br> - She's gone to see her Aunt Hilda.<br> - No. Why?<br> Said she needed an outing, Phile.<br> Like you and me.<br> - When will she come back?<br> - Not until tomorrow morning.<br> - Are we really alone?<br> - Of course we are.<br> We're going to spend the day together.<br> - Will we be alone all day, Baines?<br> - We'll be together, Phile.<br> It's misty still.<br> The cat's been out all night.<br> There she is, sniffing round the railings.<br> There's Doris shaking the mats out.<br> It's a great life if you don't weaken.<br> - It's early, isn't it?<br> - It's going to be a long day, Phile.<br> Now, you get dressed,<br> and I'll be cooking the sausages.<br> Yes. To see her aunt.<br> I'm quite alone, you understand?<br> No. Not about that. No.<br> I'll explain it all.<br> Oh, you must come.<br> You promised you would.<br> We'll have the whole day together.<br> Oh, it makes no difference<br> about the boy.<br> Yes. Uh, back here to supper, Julie.<br> Ah, of course it's safe. I... - Well, I'm so<br> looking forward to seeing you, Julie.<br> I must talk to you.<br> I'll... - I'll wait for you.<br> Of course I'll wait for you.<br> It'll amuse the boy,<br> and we'll be able to talk.<br> No. Of course he doesn't understand.<br> I'd rather see the snakes, Baines.<br> I was sure you'd like the lions.<br> My old legs are getting tired.<br> - You're not so old, Baines.<br> - I'm not so young as I used to be.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> Let's sit down over there.<br> I'll tell you things.<br> Then we'll go to the reptile house.<br> Did you shoot lions in Africa?<br> Oh, just a few. I mostly let them live.<br> - You shot a man though, Baines.<br> - Who told you that?<br> You did.<br> You murdered him, you said.<br> Murdered?<br> I never murdered anyone.<br> You said you killed someone,<br> once in Africa with that gun.<br> Oh, yes, yes. Oh, well, that wasn't murder, Phile.<br> That was self-defense.<br> You see, one day the blackies planned<br> what they call a rising.<br> I was the only white man<br> for miles around.<br> Well, this chap... -<br> He called himself a king.<br> He got the blackies properly<br> worked up, speechifying.<br> They... -<br> Yes? Go on. Go on.<br> Uh, th-they all came up to my hut.<br> Hundreds of them.<br> Knives, spears, clubs.<br> - Well, all I had was that... - that gun I showed you.<br> - Go on.<br> "Clear off," I said to that king of theirs.<br> "Hop it," I said.<br> But he was after my blood.<br> Well, if they'd got me,<br> it wouldn't have ended there.<br> They'd have tasted blood.<br> - Like those lions there.<br> - Th-Then what happened?<br> Oh, I plugged him. Then I threw the gun away<br> and went in with my fists.<br> But you found the gun again.<br> Oh, yeah. Yes. So I did.<br> I'll tell you about that one day.<br> I wish I could<br> go away with you to Africa.<br> Oh, look. There's your niece.<br> Oh, yes. So it is.<br> Now can we go and see<br> the reptile house?<br> - Look. Would you like an ice cream, Phile?<br> - I wouldn't say no, Baines.<br> Well, here's a bob. Get one forJulie too.<br> There you are. Over there.<br> What did she... -<br> - Did you tell her?<br> - No.<br> I couldn't get around to it somehow.<br> And then she went away.<br> - Two wafers, please.<br> - Two wafers.<br> - Here you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Then everything's just the same.<br> - Give me time. I'll manage it somehow.<br> - There's your ice cream.<br> - Thank you, Phillipe.<br> I've been telling Julie<br> she's gotta have supper with us.<br> But you asked on the telephone,<br> and she said she would.<br> - The things you know.<br> - It would only be worse afterwards.<br> She doesn't trust my cooking, Phile.<br> - Oh, can't we see the snakes, Baines?<br> - Of course we're going to see the snakes.<br> Hello, polly.<br> I'd like to find a snake like Macgregor.<br> - Who's Macgregor?<br> - It's a secret.<br> We don't need to have secrets from Julie.<br> Are you scared to come back home?<br> - Scared of what?<br> - Mrs. Baines.<br> Look, Phile. There... -<br> There's the reptile house. Over there.<br> Ah. You are pretty.<br> - What time's the boat train?<br> - 9:00.<br> Can you get food on the train?<br> I'm taking sandwiches.<br> Newhaven - Dieppe?<br> Dover - Calais.<br> Have you packed?<br> Of course I have.<br> Oh, stop looking after me.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Baines.<br> - Do come and have a look at the snake.<br> - Is it as nice as Macgregor?<br> - Oh, you've told her.<br> - I said we don't have secrets from Julie.<br> - I do.<br> - Macgregor wouldn't be frightened of me, would he?<br> There's only one person<br> in the whole world he's frightened of.<br> - And who's that?<br> - Mrs. Baines.<br> Baines!<br> Baines!<br> Oh, look, Baines.<br> Come and look at this.<br> Baines! What are they doing?<br> Here.<br> Where's Phile?<br> - Oh. There he is.<br> - Phile!<br> Time to be off.<br> She's coming back, Phile.<br> We'll all three have supper together.<br> Wouldn't Mrs. Baines be angry if she knew!<br> - Suppose she came back after all?<br> - She won't do that. Not when her mind's made up.<br> She... - She doesn't know<br> about yesterday, does she?<br> No. Phile's a wonder for secrets.<br> - Is it very important to keep secrets?<br> - It certainly is.<br> - Even if you don't like the person?<br> - That makes no difference.<br> Even Mrs. Baines's secrets?<br> Yes, Phillipe.<br> Even Mrs. Baines's secrets.<br> I'll just go and open up.<br> This is a "man's hole." You can get<br> right down to the sewers through here.<br> - You're very fond of Baines, aren't you, Phillipe?<br> - Of course.<br> But you don't like girls.<br> Baines doesn't either. Not really.<br> Come in, you two.<br> Telegram! Telegram!<br> Can I open it?<br> If you like.<br> This is our kitchenette.<br> Handy for getting a cup of tea.<br> It's from Mrs. Baines.<br> Her aunt's not well.<br> She won't be back for a day or two.<br> Do you think it's true?<br> True? Why, yes. Of course it's true.<br> She wouldn't say it if it wasn't. Would she?<br> Does Mrs. Baines keep secrets?<br> We don't want to waste<br> good time cooking.<br> Got plenty of tins.<br> What we want's a good spread...<br> and every man his own drink.<br> How long does<br> a telegram take to get to a place?<br> Depends where it comes from.<br> I'm going to make a dart of this one.<br> Move along now, Phile. Move along.<br> - Do telegrams cost much?<br> - Oh, don't natter.<br> Couldn't we eat out here?<br> We could easily make a...<br> table out of some of the cases.<br> - Don't you think?<br> - Yes. Of course.<br> - It would be a picnic.<br> - Oh, must we have a picnic?<br> - Well, you'd like that, wouldn't you?<br> - Can I feed Macgregor first?<br> Of course you can,<br> while I'm taking out the things.<br> - Can I come too, Phillipe?<br> - Show her Macgregor.<br> Mmm. But won't you need me here?<br> Oh, I think I can manage.<br> Mrs. Baines doesn't like Macgregor.<br> - She doesn't, huh?<br> - She doesn't like you either.<br> What do you mean? Phile.<br> What do you mean she doesn't like me?<br> She doesn't like anybody really.<br> But Baines doesn't like her.<br> - How do you know?<br> - She won't give him his... freedom.<br> - Did he ask her?<br> - Oh, yes. I heard him. But I didn't mean to listen.<br> No, no. I'm... - I'm sure you didn't.<br> - When was this?<br> - Yesterday after Baines and I came back.<br> - What did he say, Phile?<br> - "I want my freedom."Just like that.<br> And she went on. Natter, natter.<br> Always nattering.<br> Poor Baines.<br> He did want it so badly.<br> When she comes back<br> I'll ask her for my freedom too.<br> That was a good dart.<br> Why did you throw it away?<br> Oh, I can make lots more like that.<br> - What room is this?<br> - The guest room.<br> For very important people.<br> - Oh. It's very pretty.<br> - Macgregor lives here.<br> Supper.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - He's gone.<br> How could he have got out?<br> She must have killed him.<br> It's just a bit of bad luck you've got to take.<br> She never really liked him.<br> - She said he was vermin.<br> - Well, tomorrow we'll... -<br> we'll put up a little stone<br> in the garden...<br> and we'll write his name on it.<br> "Macgregor, killed by Mrs. Baines."<br> - And the date.<br> - No, no. No. Not that.<br> Something like...<br> "My Macgregor.<br> Very lovely he was in his life."<br> And then the date.<br> No. We... - We'll just have "Macgregor."<br> That'll be plenty.<br> We'll remember.<br> How about a bite of supper?<br> Then we'll play a game.<br> Come on.<br> Well, sit down, Julie.<br> Let's... - Let's have a drink to happier days.<br> Let me.<br> - Hey!<br> - Hey!<br> There he is. What is it? I've caught a fish?<br> Is it a rabbit or a roly-poly pudding?<br> Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?<br> We'll catch him this time.<br> We'll catch him and kill him.<br> Puss, puss, puss, puss,<br> puss, puss, puss, puss.<br> Thunder and lightning! Lightning and thunder!<br> Terrible storm in the jungle now.<br> I catch... - I catch... - I catch you.<br> Oh, what a run.<br> Where is he? Phile? Bedtime.<br> - Come along.<br> - Phillipe.<br> Think he went along here.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Where are you?<br> - Phillipe.<br> - No?<br> I'm only going because... -<br> because it's not possible to stay.<br> All day long I've wanted<br> to talk to you, Julie.<br> Now's my last chance.<br> Now we're alone, I just want... -<br> I just want you around always.<br> - Baines.<br> - What is it?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I saw... -<br> What frightened you?<br> I'm... - I thought I saw a ghost.<br> Aw.<br> The game's gone on too long.<br> Come on. Upstairs.<br> Where are they?<br> Where are they?<br> Don't lie to me.<br> I know they're here.<br> I have been here all the time.<br> That's not nice, Master Phillipe.<br> All I want to know is where they are.<br> I want... -<br> I want to talk to them.<br> Help me. Help Mrs. Baines.<br> Master Phillipe, we... - we've always<br> been friends, haven't we?<br> No.<br> We were friends, last night.<br> Do you remember that secret we had?<br> About them?<br> We didn't have a secret.<br> Oh, you know all about them.<br> You're not such a child<br> as you pretend to be.<br> You've got a nasty, wicked mind,<br> and it ought to be beaten out of you.<br> Phile? Phile?<br> Is that you?<br> Baines!<br> Look!<br> Help! Help!<br> She's in there!<br> You've got that girl in there!<br> - Now, wait a moment. Listen to me.<br> - I don't want to hear any excuses.<br> I know all about it. Let me get at her.<br> I'll tell her a thing or two!<br> We can say what we've got to say to<br> each other downstairs. Don't make a scene.<br> Get out of my way!<br> Don't you tell me what to do!<br> You're a fine one to dictate to me!<br> How dare you! Let me go!<br> I'll put you and her in the gutter<br> before I'm finished with you!<br> I'll give you something you'll remember<br> for the rest of your life!<br> Will you let me go!<br> Thought you had me safely out of the way,<br> didn't you? Hypocrite!<br> And you! You needn't go on<br> hiding in that room! I recognized you!<br> You needn't think you can come back here<br> on Monday to your safe littlejob!<br> - I'll get you deported out of the country!<br> - Quiet!<br> For heaven's sake,<br> don't go on like this!<br> If you've no thought of yourself or of me,<br> at least think of the boy.<br> - Him? When I'm finished with her,<br> I'll give him what he deserves!<br> - Be quiet!<br> He'll think twice before he starts on his<br> sneaking ways, the lying, beastly little brat!<br> Stop, or I'll lose my temper!<br> Now, you go downstairs.<br> I'll join you, and we'll... -<br> He pushed her.<br> Hello, sonny.<br> What are you up to?<br> Out a bit late, aren't you, sonny?<br> What's your name, sonny?<br> Come here.<br> Here.<br> Cold, sonny?<br> Come here.<br> Put this on.<br> How about<br> a nice, warm cup of tea?<br> Yes?<br> You would? Good.<br> Come on.<br> Yes?<br> Well, I'm going to have one anyway.<br> - Yes?<br> - And so I arrested her.<br> Well, Rose, what have you<br> got to say this time?<br> Nothing,<br> except it's not my turn yet.<br> Same address?<br> There we are.<br> - Now, round here. Come on.<br> - Come here.<br> Bring him here.<br> Who is he?<br> What's all this about?<br> I found him wandering about.<br> - Pickin' up kids now, are ya?<br> - Quiet, Rose.<br> Where do you live, sonny?<br> - He won't speak.<br> - Quite right.<br> Come on, sonny.<br> You come over here.<br> So, what have you been up to, eh?<br> Playing about, have you?<br> Come and sit over here.<br> There you are.<br> Now, then, what were you doing?<br> - Walking in your sleep, were you?<br> - That's all I was doing.<br> Remember where you live, sonny? Eh?<br> Come on. Try to think.<br> Come on, sonny.<br> There's nothing to be frightened of here.<br> Nothin' at all.<br> Shh. Shh.<br> We just want to help you, see.<br> You tell us where you live,<br> and we'll take you home.<br> Come on, sonny.<br> Tell us where you live.<br> See what you can do, Rose.<br> - Hello, deary.

Tell me your name.<br> - Yes, Doctor. Of course.<br> What's the matter?<br> Come on.<br> Phillipe.<br> Phillipe? Phillipe what?<br> - Yes.<br> - That's all.<br> Come on.<br> It's a bit long, isn't it?<br> You want a haircut.<br> I'll have one sent over.<br> Anything else I can do?<br> Phillipe? Phillipe what, eh?<br> Where do you live?<br> Come on, chum.<br> You pop your feet into these.<br> Oh! Aren't you a lucky boy!<br> Oh, look.<br> They'd last forever.<br> - I'd like a pair of those.<br> - Good night, Doctor.<br> jones.<br> There's been an accident... - 48 Cheston Square.<br> You know, that embassy.<br> Woman killed herself.<br> Fell down a flight of stairs.<br> Get an ambulance sent over.<br> Ask for Mr. Baines.<br> Is it too hot? Is it?<br> Here, try it now. Go on.<br> - Now, Rose, have you got the address?<br> - Give me time.<br> - Did you say the name was Baines?<br> - Uh, yes, Baines. 48 Cheston Square.<br> Baines.<br> What's the matter?<br> Do you know him?<br> I live there.<br> What made you run away, sonny?<br> Nothing.<br> You weren't frightened or anything?<br> No.<br> Then everything<br> was all right at home?<br> Yes.<br> Does your father<br> work at the embassy?<br> No. He's ambassador.<br> Oh!<br> I know your daddy!<br> Oh, there you are, Phile.<br> We picked him up in Hilton Street.<br> There's been an accident?<br> Yes.<br> - Over there?<br> - The doctor's with her now.<br> Now...<br> just... -<br> just... - just sit down there...<br> for a moment, Phile.<br> - How did it happen?<br> - We'd had a few words up there.<br> She was angry with the boy<br> for some reason.<br> The next thing I knew...<br> she'd slipped going down the stairs.<br> - Can I help at all, sir?<br> - No. Just an accident.<br> I'll be off. There's nothing more that I can do.<br> You better tell the ambassador at once.<br> He's away.<br> I've phoned the first secretary.<br> Don't worry, man.<br> More than you can help.<br> You did all that you could.<br> These things happen, you know.<br> - I can't believe that she's... -<br> - I know.<br> The ambulance will be coming.<br> I'll sign the certificate first thing in the morning.<br> - Let me see. Where did I leave my coat?<br> - It's here, I think.<br> Don't think me heartless.<br> In my position one must try to be hard.<br> Death is like a business.<br> It has to be attended to.<br> Why, it's Phillipe, isn't it?<br> What are you doing here?<br> You ought to be in bed.<br> We found him wandering around.<br> We were going to send him home<br> when we heard about the accident.<br> He said he was sleepwalking.<br> Why, I know Phillipe.<br> He doesn't walk in his sleep.<br> Do you, Phillipe?<br> What's the boy been doing?<br> Now, listen, Phillipe,<br> did anything happen to frighten you?<br> We went to the zoo, that's all.<br> The boy's tired out.<br> I'll take him upstairs to bed.<br> Wait a moment.<br> Come here, Phillipe.<br> - Did he see it?<br> - I don't think so.<br> Well, you're a fine sort of chap, aren't you,<br> wandering about at night in your pajamas.<br> Who do you think you are... -<br> Nick Carter?<br> Where'd you get this outfit?<br> We had to find him those<br> at the station.<br> Why did you run away, Phillipe?<br> I've told you... -<br> she went for the boy.<br> Tell me everything you know, Phillipe.<br> Then you won't be frightened anymore.<br> It's long past bedtime.<br> We'll go upstairs.<br> - He needs sleep.<br> - I'm a doctor, Baines.<br> Why was she angry with you, Phillipe?<br> Because of secrets.<br> Secrets?<br> Do you know what he means?<br> You've no business pestering the boy.<br> He's half asleep.<br> What were those secrets, Phillipe?<br> Come on. You can tell me.<br> Was she angry at the zoo?<br> - No.<br> - Was everything all right at the zoo?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do you know what made her angry?<br> No.<br> You're not angry with Baines,<br> are you?<br> No. Of course not.<br> You're not going<br> to send him to prison.<br> Doctors don't do that.<br> I don't mind going to bed now.<br> You'd better take him up there, Baines.<br> Give him one of these tablets.<br> Was it self-defense,<br> like in Africa?<br> Dr., um... - Dr. What's-his-name<br> is the police doctor, isn't he? Dr. Wilson?<br> Good evening, Dr. Fenton.<br> This is a terrible business.<br> Is Baines about?<br> He's upstairs putting the child to bed.<br> He was found in the street, scared.<br> What about?<br> I should like the police doctor<br> called in, if you don't mind.<br> Police doctor?<br> What's he got to do with it?<br> I should like Dr. Wilson called.<br> - Surely there is nothing to worry you, is there?<br> - Possibly not.<br> I don't like it.<br> I don't like it at all.<br> The ambassador's a great stickler.<br> He won't like the police<br> within the embassy.<br> You do realize that this is<br> officially foreign territory.<br> - Police are not allowed in here without permission.<br> - The woman's dead.<br> Yes, but an accident, surely.<br> - Probably.<br> - Well, wasn't it?<br> Perhaps.<br> But I'm not prepared<br> to sign the death certificate.<br> Very well. I'll have to phone<br> the foreign office in Scotland Yard.<br> Goodness only knows whether<br> there'll be anybody there this hour.<br> The Yard doesn't close, sir.<br> I meant the foreign office.<br> It'll make you sleep.<br> You've got to try and put it<br> right out of your head, Phile...<br> everything you've seen<br> and heard tonight.<br> I understand.<br> Well, go to sleep...<br> and forget it.<br> I'm going to give you<br> two night-lights tonight.<br> It'll be daylight before<br> you can sayJack Robinson.<br> Baines, are you going?<br> Listen, Phile, you... -<br> you remember that telegram<br> Mrs. Baines sent me?<br> You had it.<br> You... - You made a dart of it.<br> - What did you do with it?<br> - I threw it away.<br> Where?<br> I... - I don't remember.<br> Why?<br> Well, I wouldn't... -<br> I wouldn't like anyone else to find it.<br> You see, th-they think Mrs. Baines<br> was with us at the zoo.<br> It'd look funny,<br> that telegram coming.<br> And I... - I don't want them to know<br> julie was with us tonight.<br> She wouldn't like it.<br> There's no need to tell the police<br> more than they know.<br> Yes, I understand.<br> Are you scared?<br> Scared? No.<br> Only we've... - we've got to be careful<br> what we say to policemen.<br> Oh, well, no good putting it off, I suppose.<br> Better go down and talk to them.<br> Good night, Phile.<br> Baines, you could run away.<br> I remember.<br> I remember where I threw it.<br> Well, then I heard the boy say,<br> "Was it in self-defense?"<br> He admits there was a quarrel<br> at the head of the stairs.<br> - Is that the staircase?<br> - Yes.<br> Are the injuries consistent<br> with a slip... -<br> Evening, Fenton.<br> It's an awful hour to be called out.<br> - I'm used to it. It's the hour for babies.<br> - Is it? Well, what's the trouble?<br> This is Inspector Hart, sir,<br> of the special branch.<br> He'll help with any interpreting.<br> I wouldn't mind so much<br> if the ambassador was here.<br> - You were here at the time?<br> - No.<br> I was having dinner with some friends<br> in a restaurant.<br> All right, all right.<br> Where is this fellow Baines?<br> In the basement, I think.<br> No, he went upstairs<br> putting the child to bed.<br> There'd be no objection, I suppose,<br> to our seeing over the servants' quarters?<br> No, none at all.<br> Through the door there.<br> You would trouble me much less<br> if you'd speak English.<br> Of course, the story<br> of her slipping may be true...<br> but the type of injuries<br> suggest something more violent.<br> What if there'd been a push?<br> - Why do you say that?<br> - We know that they quarreled.<br> - Up there?<br> - Mmm.<br> - Is he a big chap?<br> - You saw him come down just now.<br> Oh, he.<br> - Mr. Baines?<br> - Yes.<br> We've permission<br> to ask you a few questions.<br> This has been a terrible night for you<br> and we don't propose to keep you long.<br> I'll tell you anything I know.<br> There was nobody else in the house,<br> was there, when it happened?<br> No.<br> You had supper out in the yard.<br> The boy wanted a picnic.<br> just the three of you.<br> just the boy and I.<br> But there were three places laid.<br> Oh, yes, of course.<br> I forgot.<br> Mrs. Baines was with us.<br> Try to remember things like that.<br> It helps us, you know,<br> to get the details right.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Can we have a word with you?<br> Good heavens.<br> What's he doing there?<br> Now what, boy?<br> - Come along, Phile.<br> - It's all right, Baines. I'll take him up.<br> Hello. What's this<br> you've got hold of? Hmm?<br> You don't want that now.<br> I'll take it. Now watch. See?<br> He's in the same room?<br> Baines.<br> Is he in the same room?<br> Uh, y-yes.<br> Well, what was he up to?<br> Oh, n-nothing, sir.<br> Mr. Baines, I understand<br> there was some sort of scene...<br> between your wife<br> and the boy tonight.<br> Do you know what it was about?<br> Well, she... - sh-sh-she used to<br> get in a fuss about...<br> trying to keep the house tidy.<br> Do you know what he'd been up to?<br> Or was there nothing unusual<br> to make her angry tonight?<br> No.<br> You said just now that Mrs. Baines<br> had had supper with you downstairs.<br> You did say that, didn't you?<br> Yes.<br> Well, then... -<br> I... - I... forgot.<br> She wasn't with us.<br> But there were three places laid.<br> Who else was there?<br> Nobody.<br> l-l-I must have laid it from h-habit.<br> But the third place was used.<br> How do you account for that?<br> Well, I think we'll leave all the questions<br> to Chief Inspector Crowe in the morning...<br> after he's read the doctor's report.<br> Doctor's report?<br> It's only that your story of the slip<br> doesn't quite fit in with what they say.<br> julie!<br> - Why not tell them everything?<br> - No, no. Leave it to me.<br> There's no need for you<br> to be brought into this.<br> You go to the office.<br> - Good morning, Baines.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - Are they here yet?<br> - Not yet, sir.<br> Who is this lady?<br> She... - She works here, sir,<br> in the typing room.<br> - A bit early, aren't you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I had something to do<br> that I didn't finish on Saturday.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Do you do shorthand?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Good. Don't go for a moment.<br> Chief Inspector Crowe, sir.<br> I'm the first secretary. I'm in charge here<br> until the ambassador returns.<br> Yes, I know. We shall try to cause you<br> as little trouble as possible.<br> I see.<br> This is Mr. Baines.<br> Oh.<br> My sympathy, Mr. Baines.<br> - My ambassador will expect a full report.<br> - Yes, naturally.<br> Have you any objection to<br> one of our typists taking down what's said?<br> No, none whatever.<br> Actually, I've no right to object.<br> We're on foreign territory here.<br> Oh, could I see<br> the little boy, Phillipe.<br> - If you think it's necessary... -<br> - Yes. Thank you.<br> Oh, Baines, uh, would you? Better fetch him.<br> - Have you got a notebook?<br> - I'll get one, sir.<br> There.<br> What shall I say, Baines?<br> Tell them anything they want to know,<br> except for you-know-who.<br> Was it like this<br> that time in Africa?<br> - What time?<br> - The time you killed a man.<br> Not a bit like this.<br> Don't worry, Baines.<br> I won't tell them anything.<br> Would you mind, Baines,<br> putting a notice on the front door...<br> telling the clerks to use the empty office<br> next to the visa section next door.<br> - Hello, sonny. Don't run away.<br> - I wasn't running away.<br> No, I mean, I just wanted<br> to say, "How do you do?"<br> - Your name is Phillipe, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> I've heard quite a lot about you.<br> - You're the little boy who ran away.<br> - I didn't run away.<br> I've said that again, have I?<br> I meant, you're the one<br> who took a walk.<br> And a rather late walk, wasn't it?<br> After supper, hmm?<br> Oh, quite a party you had last night,<br> didn't you? A picnic party.<br> No.<br> - Didn't you have it downstairs with... -<br> - No!<br> Do you want me<br> to take all this down?<br> No, no, no.<br> This is just friendly conversation.<br> We are friends, aren't we?<br> - Hmm?<br> - No.<br> Well, anyway, you didn't have<br> a picnic downstairs last night with anybody.<br> No!<br> I've put up the notice.<br> No!<br> I'd like to have a word<br> with Mr. Baines.<br> - Where could we be quiet?<br> - Uh, here in the ambassador's room.<br> I'd like you and your secretary<br> to be present.<br> I just want to get<br> Mr. Baines's story quite straight.<br> - My story's straight enough.<br> - Yes, yes, of course.<br> I just want to iron out<br> one or two inconsistencies.<br> Oh, would you wait outside<br> for a few moments, sonny?<br> I just want to have<br> a little talk with Mr. Baines.<br> - Have you got a ball to play with?<br> - No.<br> Well... - Oh. Mm-hmm.<br> Uh, Ames, let him borrow<br> your chiming watch.<br> It's like this, see.<br> Do be careful with it now.<br> Tsk.<br> Poor Mrs. Baines.<br> Down these very stairs.<br> I can almost see her. Can't you?<br> Yes. I expect her neck<br> was snapped like a matchstick.<br> - Mmm.<br> - Do you see any blood?<br> There wouldn't be any blood<br> if her neck was broken, would there?<br> Might be a little<br> if the bone came through.<br> Treacherous stuff, this marble.<br> I wouldn't have it in my house at any price.<br> You listen to the watch, sonny.<br> I wonder if you could find<br> something to do somewhere else, hmm?<br> Crowe says, will you photograph the position<br> of the body from the top of the stairs.<br> Right.<br> No, not that way, sonny.<br> Like this. See?<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Hmm?<br> Oh, yes. See this powder?<br> Well, that's solved more crimes<br> than the whole police force put together.<br> Here, put your thumb just down there.<br> just press it down quite like that. That's it.<br> Now put some powder on.<br> Now you blow and watch.<br> See? There's only one person in the world<br> that has a thumb like that.<br> And that's how we find things out.<br> Yes, they, uh... -<br> they want to have<br> a word with you, Phile.<br> Oh, well, we shan't need you<br> for a few moments, Baines.<br> Well, I'll be downstairs.<br> Well, Phillipe, I don't suppose<br> you ever met a detective before.<br> Except in books.<br> Did the watch work?<br> Not taken out the works yet?<br> You know, Phillipe,<br> I've got a boy at home very like you.<br> He's a bit older, that's all.<br> Oh, he likes marbles.<br> Do you like marbles?<br> Look here.<br> What do you think of that one?<br> I think that's a champion.<br> Don't you?<br> I always win with it anyway.<br> I don't suppose Mrs. Baines<br> would have liked marbles, would she?<br> But I expect Baines could<br> throw a marble with the best of us.<br> I like Baines.<br> Don't you?<br> Yes.<br> But not Mrs. Baines?<br> She killed Macgregor.<br> Killed Macgregor?<br> Who was he?<br> - My snake.<br> - Oh.<br> You can keep that marble if you'd like.<br> Baines had a quarrel with Mrs. Baines<br> about you last night, didn't he?<br> No!<br> Didn't you hear them quarreling?<br> No!<br> - Phillipe, why did you run away?<br> - I took a walk.<br> Oh, a bit late, wasn't it, for a walk?<br> In your pajamas?<br> Now, wasn't it because Mrs. Baines<br> frightened you?<br> No.<br> But she did hit you, didn't she?<br> No.<br> - She came to your room last night.<br> - No.<br> Phillipe, tell me, what did you see<br> that made you run away?<br> I didn't run away.<br> Mrs. Baines was away all day<br> yesterday, wasn't she?<br> - What did you do?<br> - I went to the zoo with Baines and... -<br> "And"?<br> Phillipe. And?<br> And then we went to the reptile house,<br> and then we came home.<br> - And then?<br> - We had supper.<br> - "We"?<br> - Baines.<br> - I, Baines and... -<br> - Yes? And?<br> And then we... -<br> And then we played games.<br> - What sort of games, Phillipe?<br> - Hide-and-seek in the dark.<br> I always get a bit frightened<br> when I play that. Who hid?<br> I hid, and they couldn't find me.<br> - "They"?<br> - Baines, I mean! Baines, I mean!<br> "They," Phillipe?<br> Now, who was with Baines?<br> - Nobody! Nobody!<br> - Phillipe.<br> - Who did you play hide-and-seek with?<br> - Baines! Just Baines!<br> You must tell the truth.<br> What is this? What are they saying?<br> - It's a bit fast, sir. I can't quite follow.<br> - Will you speak English, please.<br> Don't badger them!<br> I'm here, aren't I,<br> if you want to ask any questions.<br> Now, Phillipe, tell me...<br> who was with Baines?<br> His niece.<br> - Was she your niece, Mr. Baines?<br> - I told him so.<br> Your girl?<br> Yes. It was me.<br> - You were here?<br> - Yes. He wanted to keep me out of it.<br> He d... - He di... -<br> didn't mean any harm.<br> And this telegram?<br> She tried to catch us out, I suppose.<br> You'd better go upstairs, Phillipe.<br> You can keep the marble if you like.<br> - Baines.<br> - No, no. Mr. Baines is staying here.<br> Now we're getting somewhere.<br> Your quarrel with Mrs. Baines last night<br> was over this young lady.<br> It was what I said.<br> She went for the boy. She was hitting him.<br> That's not what the boy says.<br> Can't you see that child is lying?<br> I'm afraid there have been<br> a lot of lies in this business.<br> - There was no need for them.<br> - I sincerely hope there wasn't.<br> Now, will you come upstairs<br> and tell me exactly what happened.<br> I was in this room... with Julie.<br> Mm-hmm? Yes?<br> I thought I heard the boy calling.<br> I came out here...<br> and then I saw her hit him,<br> as I told you.<br> - Go on.<br> - She came running down these stairs.<br> She wanted to get into that room,<br> toJulie.<br> I caught hold of her.<br> She pushed me back.<br> She was hysterical.<br> She used to get into these rages<br> and do anything.<br> I've known her to put her hand<br> through a window she couldn't open.<br> I wasn't going to let her get in there.<br> Yes? And then?<br> And then I pushed her back...<br> over there.<br> She was shouting all the time.<br> I don't remember exactly what.<br> And we... - we were struggling...<br> here.<br> Yes.<br> "Stop it," I said. "Stop it.<br> Go downstairs, and presently<br> I'll come down and talk to you."<br> Then she seemed calmer<br> and started down the stairs.<br> I went back to this room.<br> - What is it, Harry?<br> - They're on the telephone from Selfridges.<br> They want to know if it'd be all right if they deliver<br> the 40 gilt chairs tomorrow afternoon...<br> instead of today...<br> as the reception<br> is not till Wednesday night.<br> Yes, yes, tomorrow will be all right.<br> Then I... -<br> I went back to this door.<br> No, Harry... - Harry, tell them they must<br> deliver the chairs today because we... -<br> just tell them they must<br> deliver the chairs as arranged.<br> Then I... -<br> I went back to the door.<br> When I got there,<br> I heard the scream...<br> as I told you.<br> I came out...<br> and when I got here...<br> I saw her hit the last step.<br> We've examined this staircase<br> very carefully, Mr. Baines...<br> and there's no evidence<br> of her having slipped.<br> When people slip,<br> they try to recover.<br> They leave some sign... -<br> a scratch on the banister, anything.<br> It's just like a car skidding.<br> - What, and there's nothing?<br> - Nothing.<br> And the injuries would indicate<br> something more than a slip.<br> You're quite sure<br> you didn't, uh, push her?<br> You were both, I take it, very angry.<br> I'd done enough to her without that.<br> You see,<br> if she'd slipped from here...<br> or even a few steps down...<br> she couldn't possibly have landed<br> where she did... -<br> because we've tested that... -<br> unless she was pushed.<br> You're a very strong man, Mr. Baines.<br> You probably don't know your own strength.<br> I didn't push her.<br> Why did the boy ask you,<br> "Was it self-defense...<br> as in Africa?"<br> I've never been out of the country.<br> - Never?<br> - Well, except once, to Ostend.<br> Very well, Mr. Baines. Would you come<br> into the other room? And you too, miss.<br> - And whose room is this?<br> - A guest room.<br> Where were you when it happened,<br> when the scream came, hmm?<br> Yes?<br> There.<br> Although there had been a struggle outside<br> and angry words, according to Mr. Baines?<br> I couldn't do anything else.<br> I should have thought<br> you'd have got up and tried to hide.<br> I couldn't.<br> I'm sorry to have to ask you<br> all these questions.<br> - You then dressed in a great hurry, I suppose.<br> - Of course.<br> That would be after the scream.<br> Yes.<br> How long was that<br> after the child called out?<br> I don't know.<br> Two, three minutes.<br> I don't know.<br> - The child said he never called out.<br> - He must be lying.<br> It's obvious somebody must be lying.<br> When you dressed,<br> what did you do?<br> He showed me out.<br> Wouldn't it have been wiser,<br> and more honest, to have stayed?<br> He wanted to keep me out of it.<br> I was frightened because of our lies.<br> I don't understand you.<br> Then I... - I can't explain to you.<br> How long had you known Mr. Baines?<br> Ever since I started to work<br> at the embassy... - seven months.<br> - Without Mrs. Baines's knowledge?<br> - Yes.<br> And all that time you were<br> carrying on an affair with each other.<br> - We are very busy here.<br> - Won't be a moment.<br> Look, can't you come back later?<br> The first Monday of every month...<br> this clock has to be done.<br> They behave much better if they're, uh... -<br> if they're looked after.<br> Oh, be as quick as you can.<br> You don't want to do itjerkily...<br> and not too fast.<br> You must take your time.<br> Thank you.<br> Did you ever discuss marriage?<br> No.<br> But your relations with this man<br> were intimate.<br> - We love each other.<br> - And intimacy took place during that period?<br> We don't talk the same language.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> - I mean, in plain language... -<br> - Oh, leave her alone, can't you?<br> Don't worry.<br> It's his duty to ask questions.<br> Last night was the first time<br> we were ever alone like this.<br> Now, you take your photographs<br> and fingerprints and everything.<br> It's love you'll photograph,<br> not "intimacy."<br> What do you want, sonny?<br> You've got to leave Baines alone.<br> He didn't do it.<br> - Didn't do what?<br> - He didn't murder her!<br> Why did you say "murder," Phillipe?<br> No one has mentioned murder.<br> Thank heaven someone has then.<br> Why did you say "murder," Phillipe?<br> He didn't do it.<br> Well, if he didn't do it...<br> who did?<br> Hmm?<br> I did. My thumbmark's<br> downstairs on the banister.<br> Will somebody take this child away?<br> Come on.<br> - I'll take him upstairs.<br> - No, Mr. Baines, it might be better<br> if you kept away from the boy.<br> What, are you charging me?<br> I would advise you<br> to reconsider your story.<br> You've already admitted that you were<br> both quarreling at the top of the stairs.<br> Perhaps there was a push<br> that you didn't intend.<br> Only please don't ask us<br> to believe too much.<br> - I tell you, I don't know how she fell!<br> - He's quite right, Baines.<br> - Think carefully.<br> - I don't have to think! It's the truth!<br> Run along, sonny.<br> - I'll take him up.<br> - I don't think you'd better, miss.<br> There's questions to be asked, and the less<br> either of you see the boy the better.<br> - Are you forbidding me?<br> - No, I'm advising you. That's all.<br> - In your interest and Mr. Baines's.<br> - Well, I know his interests better than you do.<br> As you please, miss.<br> - Would you care to sit down, Mr. Baines?<br> - I'm all right.<br> Listen, you've got to stop telling these lies.<br> It's only silly. It makes things much worse.<br> It doesn't. We've got to think of lies<br> and tell them all the time.<br> Then they won't find out the truth.<br> But Baines didn't do it, Phillipe!<br> She hit me.<br> Baines doesn't let people hit me.<br> Of course he doesn't.<br> But he'd never kill anyone. You must know that.<br> - Why, he did in Africa.<br> - Oh, that's one of his stories.<br> He's never been to Africa.<br> Baines doesn't tell me lies.<br> He's got a gun too.<br> You can't have understood, Phillipe.<br> The truth can't harm Baines.<br> Don't you realize he's innocent?<br> - Oh, if there could only have been a witness.<br> - What's a witness?<br> Someone who saw.<br> Couldn't I say<br> that I saw somebody?<br> Phillipe, now what<br> have I just told you?<br> Now listen, you promise that from now on<br> you'll speak only the truth.<br> - Must I?<br> - Yes, you must. Now, you promise?<br> - If you like.<br> - All right. Now you go and tell them<br> that you told a lot of lies.<br> Mr. Baines, it would be<br> much more satisfactory...<br> if you'd consent to come along with us<br> just to make a formal statement.<br> And more convenient<br> for the embassy too, I should think.<br> Do I have to?<br> You've got to decide it yourself, Baines.<br> They can't force you to leave here.<br> They can't arrest you<br> so long as you are an embassy employee.<br> Of course,<br> we could appeal to the ambassador.<br> - Yes, yes? What is it, Phillipe?<br> - I've told you lies.<br> Yes, yes, I know all that.<br> I'd strongly advise you, Mr. Baines... -<br> - Mrs. Baines did hit me.<br> - Yes, yes. You shouldn't tell lies.<br> I only wanted to help Baines.<br> Please.<br> I'd strongly advise you, Mr. Baines, to come with us,<br> or else we shall have to appeal to the ambassador.<br> I don't want His Excellency troubled.<br> I'll get my hat.<br> That's all right, Mr. Baines.<br> Perhaps Mr. Hart would get it for you.<br> I'm not under arrest yet, am I?<br> I'm going down to my own basement...<br> and I haven't invited the police there.<br> Baines! Oh, Baines!<br> Now, now, you, uh... -<br> you mustn't come with me, Phile.<br> They... - They don't want me<br> to talk to you.<br> I haven't done harm, have I?<br> Trouble is, we... -<br> we've told a lot of lies.<br> About Africa... -<br> you didn't make it up, did you?<br> They weren't lies.<br> Why, that was just a game, Phile.<br> I didn't really do those things.<br> No?<br> But you did kill Mrs. Baines,<br> didn't you?<br> Yes?<br> - Didn't you?<br> - No.<br> Oh.<br> But you did want to be free,<br> didn't you?<br> There are faults on both sides, Phile.<br> We don't have any call to judge.<br> Perhaps she was what she was because...<br> I am what I am.<br> We ought to be very careful, Phile...<br> 'cause we make one another.<br> I thought God made us.<br> Trouble is,<br> we take a hand in the game.<br> I hope your mother comes back soon.<br> Good-bye, Phile.<br> Oh, Baines, we must never<br> tell any more lies.<br> - Mr. Crowe, sir.<br> - Yes?<br> - Will you come over here a minute?<br> - What is it?<br> Somebody's been up here.<br> Oh, sir, that was me.<br> Sir! Sir!<br> Please.<br> I want to tell you something.<br> I want to tell you something.<br> It's very important.<br> Yes, it's a woman's heel mark, all right.<br> - Please, sir. Please.<br> - Run along.<br> - You can see how it happened.<br> - Oh, please. It'll only take a minute.<br> - She wanted to see into the bedroom...<br> - Please, sir. Please.<br> - maybe force her way in.<br> - Will you listen to me, please?<br> She came along here<br> and upset the flowerpot.<br> Please, sir!<br> It's about the flowerpot.<br> - Could she have got<br> into the bedroom from there?<br> - Ah, yes, sir, easily.<br> - I must tell you. Will you listen to me?<br> - Come along. We don't want another accident.<br> You must listen to me.<br> How much easier it would be if everybody<br> told the police the truth in the first place.<br> It's very important! Please!<br> - Would you call Mr. Baines.<br> - I'll get him.<br> - The flowerpot, Julie, was there when... -<br> - It's all right. They know what happened.<br> - She upset it before she fell.<br> - But it was me. I upset it.<br> Now, will somebody<br> please listen to me!<br> You don't need your hat.<br> They know what happened.<br> It's all right.<br> Come on upstairs.<br> You must listen.<br> It will make everything all right.<br> - Now, sonny... -<br> - It's the truth.<br> - I'd like to call your ambassador on his return<br> just to explain our action.<br> - Oh, please. Oh, please.<br> Oh, Mr. Baines,<br> we shan't require you after all.<br> We found some evidence up there<br> which makes sense of your story.<br> Yes, she... - she's told me.<br> Now we know how it happened,<br> what you've said is quite clear.<br> - Please, I've got to tell you something.<br> - Will you send this young shaver about his business?<br> - Come along, Phile.<br> - I've got to tell him.<br> Sit down over there, Phile.<br> We'll attend to you presently.<br> Come on. Come on. Over there.<br> - Sir, please! I'm telling the truth!<br> - Sit down.<br> Your father always goes away<br> at the worst possible moment.<br> - It's the truth this time.<br> - Where did we leave the hats?<br> - I'll go and get them, sir.<br> Your evidence will be needed<br> at the inquest, Mr. Baines.<br> Of course, we must keep the boy out of it.<br> Oui.<br> I'm afraid, sir,<br> we've caused you some trouble.<br> That's all right.<br> If only... -<br> Oh, well.<br> That doesn't matter.<br> Oh, please. Please.<br> It's the truth. Please.<br> Oh, please, do listen to me.<br> Please.<br> It's very important<br> what I want to tell you.<br> Well, what is it?<br> - Julie said only the truth would help Baines.<br> - What do you want to say?<br> It wasn't Mrs. Baines that upset the flowerpot.<br> It was me. You see?<br> It's my fault.<br> I did it.<br> - I've told fibs in my time too.<br> - Cross my heart!<br> Shall I tell you a secret?<br> No!<br> Nice weekend, Mr. Baines?<br> Phillipe!<br> Phillipe, your mother!<br>
