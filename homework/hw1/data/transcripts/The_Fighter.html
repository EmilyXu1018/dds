                        - You bringing Micky in?<br> - Yeah, he's gonna come.<br> He should be here as well.<br> You think he'll answer questions?<br> They said it was<br> gonna be both of us here.<br> - Am I looking right in the camera here?<br> - Just look at me, right here.<br> All right. You don't want me to look<br> in the camera with the...<br> - Right over here.<br> ...interviews?<br> I started boxing<br> when I was 12 years old,<br> and I'd lie and say I was 18,<br> or whatever it was.<br> You know, I had a different<br> name and everything.<br> I mean, I don't know how many fights...<br> I'd done a hundred, more than that,<br> before I turned professional.<br> - Go ahead and sit right there.<br> - Why we doing this?<br> - I don't wanna do this.<br> - You want to start again?<br> This is my younger brother.<br> I taught him everything he knows.<br> I'm still his trainer.<br> You know, we got different styles.<br> I'm fuckin' squirrelly as fuck.<br> I'm like... I'm not even there.<br> You know, that's what Sugar Ray said.<br> I was the most tricky fighter<br> he'd ever come across.<br> In '78, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard.<br> I went toe-to-toe with him.<br> He couldn't get to me.<br> He couldn't get to me.<br> They called me the pride...<br> the pride of Lowell.<br> Everybody still talks about it,<br> especially my brother.<br> His whole life he wanted<br> to do what I did, you know?<br> But we're very different fighters.<br> Micky's, you know,<br> he's a heavy hitter.<br> He's got... a thunderous,<br> I'm telling you,<br> thunderous left punch.<br> Micky, he gets you<br> and he takes a punishment,<br> I don't know why he does it,<br> till you're right fuckin' in there.<br> He likes getting on the inside,<br> I stay on the outside.<br> Come on.<br> Dicky.<br> Would you come on?<br> Will you stop?<br> You gotta help me finish this.<br> Come on!<br> - And predictable as ever.<br> - All right.<br> - You don't need to be Columbo<br> - Here you go.<br> To see where this fight is headed.<br> Bam!

Hey, Lou!<br> - How are you guys?<br> - Dicky.<br> Making my comeback.<br> Hey, naughty, naughty.<br> What's going on here?<br> Hey, Dicky, Micky!<br> Take my picture.<br> - Take a picture?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hey!<br> - Hey, Louie!<br> HBO's making a movie on me!<br> What's going on? Hey, beautiful.<br> Did you tap that?<br> I can't remember. I got CRS:<br> I Can't Remember Shit!<br> Hey, Jerry Garcia!<br> Are you nuts?<br> How'd you get here?<br> You drive around?<br> Hey, Ray. Ray. I love you, Ray.<br> You're doing well.<br> You're walking. Get on it.<br> - We make a mistake?<br> - Nah, I mean, he'll be here.<br> You know, like I said,<br> sometimes he goes on his own schedule<br> but when he gets here, we work hard.<br> You know, nobody pushes me harder.<br> He's supposed to be<br> training you right now, right?<br> Why don't you just go talk to them,<br> my sisters? They'll talk your ear off.<br> You gotta pay them to shut up.<br> He can tell you<br> how Dicky was helping him.<br> Yeah, come on, Micky.<br> - O'Keefe!<br> - Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.<br> You know where he is.<br> What's that Keystone Kop<br> doing in there?

Girls?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Did you see him, your brother?<br> - Not this morning?<br> - Look at Ma!<br> All dressed up for the movie, huh?<br> - Wow!<br> - Get outta the ring, O'Keefe.<br> My Dicky should be doing that, huh?<br> Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.<br> Micky's got an important fight<br> coming up and he's not training.<br> Don't. Just forget about him.<br> He's number two man.<br> He's not part of this, all right?<br> - He's not being handled right.<br> - You get me coming in all right?<br> You want me to do that again?<br> Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.<br> Dicky's the trainer.<br> - I'm doing a favor, Alice.<br> - I will show you over here<br> these scrapbooks<br> I've been collecting for years.<br> Micky used to follow<br> his big brother everywhere.<br> Taught ya everything, didn't he, honey?<br> In '78, we got the offer<br> to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.<br> Oh, my God, it was...<br> Have you seen that video?<br> Oh, you're from HBO.<br> You gotta see it again. Come on.<br> Art, Art, where's the video at?<br> Tonight, my son is gonna surprise<br> everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.<br> Believe me, I know it.<br> Sugar Ray might have<br> some trouble tonight.<br> That's a good possibility.<br> He comes in here against a good boxer,<br> a young man who can punch,<br> and I would like to say at this time<br> that physically<br> they're just about equal.<br> Leonard is down.<br> Let's see if that's a knockdown.<br> This is unbelievable.<br> Eklund just walked over him!<br> Nobody seems<br> to know what's happening!<br> Dicky did it.<br> Yeah.

You did.<br> - I didn't park it.<br> - Check your pockets for the keys.<br> - You got the keys, yeah?<br> - I didn't park it, man.<br> - Down there? I don't know.<br> - Check your pockets, all right?<br> - You're fuckin' mental.<br> - Fuck it!<br> I'll run. I need the fuckin' roadwork.<br> - Roadwork? Are you crazy?<br> - He's a great runner.<br> Hey.<br> Hey!<br> Quacka!<br> - Hey, Dicky.<br> - Better late than never.<br> Oh, look! Detective's on the scene.<br> Gonna get to the bottom of this.<br> - Figure this one out, huh?<br> - Dick, you're an asshole.<br> Hold it, hold it.<br> Let me get this straight.<br> You guys are working in the same corner<br> as Micky, together, right?<br> Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner,<br> and this is what goes on.<br> OK.<br> Don't you have<br> a job to go to or something?<br> Really, O'Keefe has a job<br> that he should be at.<br> Yeah, Sergeant<br> O'Keefe's working overtime here.<br> So we got Saoul Mamby,<br> Jewish, black, former world champ.<br> I think we got all the bases covered.<br> And my kid brother,<br> he's lost three fights in a row.<br> You know, he can't get used<br> to losing. It's a mental thing.<br> But we're gonna break<br> that with Mamby, right?<br> Yeah, I hope, if we can train...<br> We can train, right. Enough of you<br> wasting time, Mick. You know?<br> - Wasting time?<br> - Half the fuckin' day's gone!<br> - We got work to do.<br> - Yeah, half the day's gone,<br> - and I been waiting here for you.<br> - You wanna win?<br> Jab, two, three, four.<br> Left, right, punch right.

There you go!<br> Come on, move!<br> Might as well drop the weight,<br> we're gonna out-box Mamby.<br> - Take it out on the mitts.<br> - Head, body, head.<br> That's your fuckin' combo.<br> Head, body, head.<br> Head, body, head, body.<br> My Dicky taught him that.<br> You know,<br> Sugar Ray's gonna be there,<br> calling the fight for ESPN.<br> I ain't seen him<br> since I knocked him down.<br> Like 14 years ago or somethin'. Right?<br> Hook!<br> Let's get<br> a real sparring going on here.<br> Don't wanna embarrass yourself.<br> Don't wanna embarrass yourself<br> in front of Sugar Ray, do you, Mick?<br> - You got him...<br> - Come on.

Charlene!<br> Hey, Charlene!<br> - We're doing shots with Charlene!<br> - Yeah, you get over here.<br> - Come on! Come over here.<br> - Come on, drink yours.<br> On the count of three... Three!<br> Good job, fellas.<br> Oh, hey, one more time.<br> Why don't you just go talk to her?<br> She's a nice girl.<br> I told her all about you.<br> I don't wanna ask her<br> if she's gonna say no.<br> Can't beat that ass, can ya?<br> Get out of the booth.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Are you just gonna stand there<br> and stare at my ass?<br> Your father stares at my ass,<br> but he talks to me.<br> Thinks you're the greatest.<br> - He didn't tell me you were mute.<br> - Keep the change, doll.<br> He told me you're<br> Kenny Fleming's sister.<br> - This is a tip?<br> - Yeah, that's my tip.<br> You know what the bell<br> says about this tip?<br> Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.<br> Comes in here every day,<br> gives me shitty tips.<br> - Fuck that.<br> - Yeah, fuck you, too.<br> - Forget it, boys...<br> - You pave streets, right?<br> - Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.<br> - Oh, yeah,<br> I heard you were a stepping-stone.<br> - No, I'm no stepping-stone.<br> - You're the guy they use,<br> against the other fighters<br> to move the other fighters up.<br> I've had a few tough fights,<br> but that's not who I am.<br> The next fight's gonna show who I am.<br> Yeah, and he's<br> gonna lose that one, too.<br> Scotch and soda, Charlene.<br> And one for yourself.<br> So move that sugar ass<br> and get my...<br> You be nice. OK?<br> Be respectful.<br> Don't disrespect her.<br> Hey, don't hurt your hands.<br> We got a fight next week.<br> Besides, you wipe<br> your ass with that one.<br> Don't lean up, or I'm gonna hit you<br> in the cocksucker.<br> - He's gonna beat Saoul Mamby, say it!<br> - Yeah, he's gonna beat him!<br> Right? Right? Hey!<br> - Right.<br> - That's right!<br> I'm gonna take your drink, as well.<br> I'm taking his drink.<br> Hey, this guy's gonna be champion.<br> He's a great guy.<br> He's a great fighter. You can't<br> go wrong. Thanks for the drink.<br> Those cameras are makin'<br> a movie about him.<br> He knocked down<br> Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO,<br> that's why they're following him<br> around with the camera.<br> And now they're making<br> a movie about his comeback.<br> Yeah, everybody's talking about it.<br> But who are you fightin'?<br> - Saoul Mamby.<br> - Saoul Mamby?<br> - What kind of name is that?<br> - Black and Jewish.<br> Where did they find a guy like that?<br> He's no joke. Former world champ.<br> - Former champ?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I match up good with him though.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What does that mean?<br> Well, I got lighter, you know?<br> I have a reputation for brawlin',<br> but I'm not gonna brawl with him.<br> I'm gonna try and out-box him.<br> - And there's a difference?<br> - Yeah, you know.<br> Brawlin', you slug it out.<br> I hit you, you hit me.<br> Boxing's a chess game, you know?<br> I pick my punches to take him down.<br> And go head, body, head, body.<br> - What is "head, body, head, body"?<br> - Well, I hit him in the head,<br> and then his hand's gonna go up<br> to protect himself,<br> so it opens up his body,<br> and then when I hit him in the body,<br> the hand goes back down,<br> I go back up to the head,<br> hand goes back up, hit him in the body.<br> People who don't know fighting<br> think you can do a lot of damage<br> hitting somebody in the head,<br> but you do more hitting 'em in the body.<br> So what do you think?<br> Can I take you out?<br> Are you married?<br> No. Would I ask you out<br> if I was married?<br> - What kind of guy do you think I am?<br> - Happens all the time. Trust me.<br> I'm not like that.<br> I'm not married. I got a daughter.<br> I see her every other weekend.<br> Her name's Kasie. But that's it.<br> Come on. Let me take you out.<br> When?<br> Saturday night.<br> I get back from Atlantic City.<br> - Is this the real number?<br> - You have to call it and see.<br> I will. Saturday. Dinner and a movie.<br> - Hey. Jimmy.<br> - Micky, hey. How's it going?<br> I don't think Laurie's<br> expecting you right now.<br> What's he doin' here?<br> This isn't your visitation day, Micky.<br> Look, I just want to say hi to Kasie.<br> It's not your day. Good-bye.<br> Yeah, but I'm not<br> around next weekend.<br> - You ditchin' the days you do have?<br> - No, I have a fight. I told you that.<br> - Jimmy...<br> - I can't get in the middle.<br> I can't talk to her, OK?<br> So I'm asking you, Jimmy.<br> I want to talk to my daughter. Now.<br> - Talk to your father.<br> - Goddamn it, Jimmy.<br> Daddy's gonna fight Saoul Mamby.<br> That's right. I want<br> to tell you that after I win,<br> I'm gonna start making good money,<br> and I'll move into a bigger apartment<br> like we talked about<br> so you can live with me more days, OK?<br> - Yeah, bigger apartment!<br> - Wish me luck, all right?<br> Don't hold your breath, Kasie.<br> It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.<br> Good luck, Daddy.<br> Thanks, Kasie.<br> I love you, honey.

Get a look, all right!<br> Going to Hollywood!<br> Going to Hollywood, yeah!<br> All right!<br> All right, get this started!<br> Lowell was the birthplace of<br> the Industrial Revolution in America.<br> Industrial Revolution... Lowell.<br> I used to live over there.<br> This town got good memories, right?<br> - Check it out.<br> - Fuck, yeah.<br> - This house here, this white house?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> White, big fat guy.<br> First time I got my crack, over here.<br> Did you ever know that?<br> They smoke crack at the White House?<br> White, black, Puerto Rican, everything.<br> The first time I did crack, or whatever,<br> I was about 23<br> and a friend of mine gave me<br> a gram, or whatever.<br> Fuck, I wish that'd never happened.<br> Before that, I'd been doing<br> the Silver Mittens and stuff.<br> I was the only kid.<br> I'd be 12... I was shit... faced.<br> I'll tell ya how crack works.<br> When it enters your lungs...<br> When it enters your lungs...<br> - I wanna watch, Daddy.<br> - Oh, my God. No, sweetie.<br> - You go back upstairs.<br> - But I wanna watch Daddy on TV.<br> I know, baby.

Are you talking<br> shit about the family?<br> - Oh, no, no, no...<br> - I heard you say "Dicky, Micky..."<br> We're not like that.<br> This is not what Lowell is all about.<br> I thought he could make a comeback<br> - and make us proud, but he didn't.<br> - I don't know what Dicky was thinking.<br> Very disappointing,<br> very disgusting.<br> You brought the city of<br> Lowell back 30 years. We're not happy.<br> - Hello?<br> - Jimmy?<br> Hey, will you do me a favor?<br> Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?<br> Actually, we're watching it right now,<br> Mick, but don't worry about it.<br> I got it...<br> I want her to see it.<br> Let her see who her uncle is.<br> - What?<br> - Who you are.<br> Who I am?<br> What are you talking about?<br> - Kids need to know the truth, Mick.<br> - Laurie, turn it off, please.<br> She does not need to see this.<br> She doesn't need to see it.<br> She's a kid.<br> When you smoke crack, you know...<br> ...you feel so much lighter.<br> You know, you feel young, like when<br> everything was in front of you,<br> everything was just...<br> ...everything was... just...<br> ...it was in front of you, you know?<br> And then...<br> ...it fades and you<br> gotta get high again.<br> Your part in the movie<br> is gonna end with you going to jail.<br> What about little Dicky?<br> Who's gonna take care of him, huh?<br> You guys can't talk to 'em?<br> Oh, man...<br> Turn this shit off.<br> Turn this off, all right?<br> Turn it off. Will you turn this off?<br> If you don't...<br> I'm turning it fuckin' off.<br> Hey, hey, that is my life.<br> - My movie night!<br> - That's my fuckin' life out there.<br> - I wanna watch this.

He's crying. He needs me.<br> And I'm fuckin' stuck in here?<br> But you know what?<br> Dicky was a street kid.<br> Micky, you watching this?<br> What are they doing to us?<br> Ma, I don't know what to tell you.<br> You're pretending like you<br> don't know what's going on.<br> He's been doing this for years.<br> Yeah, I know it's horrible, Ma, but...<br> - What do you think?<br> - You think they set him up?<br> What do you think he was doing?<br> You know, gave him money,<br> gave him drugs for the movie. Right?<br> Micky... Micky?<br> Shit. Micky...<br> - You got a new bag, huh?<br> - Yup.<br> - New bracket, too?<br> - Yup.<br> - What happened to the peanut?<br> - I don't know.<br> It's like a beach ball.<br> - Mick. Sal Lonano.<br> - Hey, Mick, how you doing?<br> You own a cab company,<br> you're a good businessman, right?<br> - Yeah, he's very organized.<br> - How's the hand?<br> It's good. You know,<br> it's getting better. Stronger.<br> Yeah, you know, I made a few calls<br> already. I talked to Buddy Tags.<br> Said he can set up something local,<br> something to start back with.<br> - Get your confidence back.<br> - That's it.<br> You gotta get your confidence back.<br> That's all.<br> Your dad wants Sal to manage ya,<br> and he wants me to train ya.<br> But I'll only do it on one condition.<br> - No crazy-time nonsense.<br> - It's how it's gotta be.<br> - No Dicky. No Alice.<br> - No Dicky. No Alice.<br> I get it, I get it.<br> I'm good, I understand.<br> - Look, I appreciate the opportunity.<br> - I can't take the bullshit, Mick.<br> - No offense, Georgie.<br> - None taken.<br> I'm gonna be the one who gets<br> his balls cut off, anyway.<br> - Yeah. You laugh.<br> - You...<br> ...fuckin' traitor!<br> - What are you doing?<br> What the hell's the matter with you?!<br> Come on! The pans hurt!<br> Do they hurt?! I hope it hurts!<br> - Sal Lonano is a good man!<br> - A good man?!<br> He's a legitimate businessman,<br> for Chrissakes!<br> - Legitimate businessman?<br> - Yes. What?<br> Oh, my God,<br> you know what that sounds like?<br> - He's a crook, George!<br> - He owns a taxi cab company!<br> - He's organized!<br> - Oh, my God. He's a cab driver.<br> He knows everything<br> about boxing, right?<br> I don't think so! He's gonna steal<br> your son's money and rob him blind!<br> Why would you think that?<br> Why would you even think that?<br> - Why can't you trust anybody with?<br> - I know people.<br> I know, George, you think I don't<br> know anything, but I know people.<br> - I know you know people.<br> - And that Sal Lonano<br> banana fucking thing,<br> we don't need that in our lives!<br> We haven't made one dollar<br> with these kids!<br> - You betrayed me!<br> - Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.<br> - You always react the same way.<br> - He's a fuckin' crook!<br> What's Micky supposed to do?<br> Dicky's in jail!<br> We're not talking about his trainer,<br> sweetheart!<br> We're talking about his manager,<br> that's me!<br> But, Mom, maybe Micky<br> should try something different!<br> What are you doing opening<br> your mouth in my kitchen?<br> - You owe me $200.<br> - I said I was gonna pay you next week.<br> I don't want<br> another word outta you.<br> That was last month<br> you told me two weeks.<br> You take sides against me in<br> my own house, you owe me money?<br> And Ma's been great<br> to Micky, Sherri.<br> Really, I mean, who's gonna look out<br> for Micky better than his own mother?<br> It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.<br> We gotta get rid of her.<br> Ma, we gotta get rid of her.<br> It's that girl, Charlene. She gotta go.<br> You're gonna get Charlene involved?<br> - Is that what you're telling me?<br> - I know where she lives.<br> What are you pickin' on her for?<br> She lives in that<br> yellow house on Stevens Street.<br> I'm gonna go talk to Micky,<br> sort this out for myself.<br> Yeah, sure. You go handle it<br> with your vigilantes. All of yous now.<br> This is wrong, Alice!<br> I got it!<br> Get outta my way! Get in the car!<br> Come on, come on, come on, come on!<br> Get in the car.<br> - Yeah, they're in there!<br> - Up there on the second floor.<br> Micky!<br> Where the hell are you?<br> You up there? Come on down!<br> Where are you?<br> Holy shit, Micky, your mother<br> and your sisters are here.<br> No, don't.<br> Do not go out there. Please.<br> No, I'm not hiding from<br> your crazy fuckin' family.<br> Hi.<br> Well, well, well.<br> Look at this.<br> Look at what?<br> - Why you hiding from us, Micky?<br> - He's not hiding.<br> Wasn't talking to you.<br> I was talking to my son.<br> What are you doing, Mickster?<br> I'm right here.<br> I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.<br> You're not helping yourself with<br> your father's scumbag friend Lonano.<br> What are you gonna do,<br> turn your back on Dicky next?<br> All we ever wanted for you<br> was to be world champion.<br> Micky's a grown man.<br> He can think for himself.<br> - Shut your mouth.<br> - Skank.<br> Don't call me skank. I'll rip that nasty<br> hair right out of your fuckin' head.<br> I'm his mother. And his manager.<br> You're not my manager anymore.<br> And I'm not waiting for Dicky, OK?<br> I'm not gettin' any younger.<br> Who's gonna look after you, sweetheart?<br> I mean, come on. I know you don't<br> understand it, but I had nine kids<br> - and I love every one of you the same.<br> - You got a funny way of showing it,<br> letting him get beat up,<br> letting him get his hand broken.<br> - You're crazy.<br> - You fuckin' bar skank!<br> - What did I just say to you?<br> - Don't put your hands on her...<br> - Get off of me!<br> - Stop it!<br> Let her go!<br> Let her go!<br> - Fuck you, Charlene!<br> - Fuck you!<br> - Get the fuck outta here! Now!<br> - Fuck you, Charlene!<br> - Skank!<br> - Micky...<br> - Fuckin' bitch!<br> - Oh, my God! Gail!<br> What'd she do to your nose?<br> What is happenin'?<br> What is happenin' to everybody?<br> I don't understand, sweetheart.<br> Why... Why do you think<br> I spell my name with an E?<br> 'Cause I don't.<br> - No-E Micky Ward.<br> - Hey, somebody push the button.<br> - Where we going? What's with the ring?<br> - Ring's across the street.<br> - The ring's across the street?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, smaller venue.<br> They got no dressin' rooms over there.<br> - Yeah, but...<br> - Micky, It's just a start. Don't worry.<br> Hey. Good luck.<br> That's it!<br> Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!<br> Visit for Dick Eklund.<br> Dicky!<br> Eklund, you got a visitor!<br> Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.<br> That's good.<br> I know you know what I been doing.<br> I'm sure Alice<br> and everybody else told you.<br> I just wanted to tell you<br> to your face myself.<br> I got new management.<br> Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.<br> It's all good.<br> Yeah. They got you fightin'<br> Alfonso Sanchez.<br> - On HBO.<br> - And you're proud of that?<br> - Fuckin' right.<br> - HBO is invested in the Mexican.<br> I didn't think they were gonna be<br> invested in me?<br> - I got a shot. I'm gonna take it.<br> - Wake up.<br> They don't care if he kills you.<br> Mike Toma did it. He's using you,<br> like a stepping-stone for Sanchez.<br> - Why don't you see?<br> - Oh, I see.<br> How could I stand a chance without the<br> great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?<br> You didn't give a fuck<br> if I got killed by Mungin.<br> Now all of a sudden you're worried<br> Sanchez is gonna hurt me? Why?<br> 'Cause you're stuck in here and can't<br> be the center of attention no more?<br> - You need it that bad?<br> - I've seen this Mexican fight.<br> He fights, hits,<br> like a fuckin' mule, all right?<br> Fifteen knockouts, undefeated.<br> You crazy?<br> And that taxi cab idiot,<br> Lonano, he went right for it.<br> He's a paper gangster,<br> he's using you to steal money.<br> Why can't you just shut up<br> and be happy for me?<br> I spent the last ten years of my life<br> in bad fights set up by you and Alice.<br> I finally got a good thing going for me<br> and you can't be fuckin'<br> happy for me? Why?<br> What's your plan?<br> How you gonna fight Sanchez?<br> - I ain't here to talk about that.<br> - What's your plan?<br> - I am not here to talk about that.<br> - What's your plan?<br> Yes, you are.<br> You watch the fight<br> and you'll see the plan.<br> I can't watch it. They don't let us.<br> It's too fuckin' violent. I mean...<br> Two minutes, Dicky.<br> They'll let us watch a stupid<br> documentary about crack,<br> but I can't watch my own<br> brother fighting, you know?<br> Hey... Mick, what is it?<br> You scared? You embarrassed<br> because you don't even have a plan?<br> I'm your brother. Just tell me.<br> Are you gonna shit on it<br> no matter what I say?<br> I'm not gonna shit on it. Just tell me.<br> Go toe-to-toe.<br> Overhand right in the middle rounds.<br> He's weak against the overhand right.<br> Who came up with that?<br> Fatty fuck O'Keefe?<br> Fuck you, Dicky.<br> You gotta run against this guy.<br> Let him punch himself out.<br> Take him to the body, right? Get inside.<br> Switch stances like you're gonna<br> work his right, hit him on the left.<br> You ain't me. All right?<br> You can't be me.<br> - Careful. Switch outside...<br> - You had a hard enough time<br> being you when you had<br> your fuckin' chance,<br> and that's why you're in here.<br> I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.<br> I'm talking about the way<br> you fight, you moron!<br> Yeah, you know I'm right!<br> He knows I'm right. All right.<br> He knows I'm right.<br> Ward's record: 29 wins,<br> seven losses so far, 20 KOs.<br> He's been a little better since<br> he refocused himself on the sport,<br> as JB pointed out.<br> Now, here's Ward's opponent,<br> Alfonso Sanchez, out of Tijuana, Mexico.<br> You see the record: 16 wins,<br> There's Mike Toma,<br> the promoter of the fight,<br> who has a lot invested in Sanchez.<br> And he says that Sanchez is<br> one of the most talented young<br> prospects in the sport of boxing.<br> This is really one of<br> the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.<br> - Get out of the corner!<br> - Micky Ward is 31 years old,<br> he's here because he needs the money,<br> he's taking a beating...<br> And my point is<br> that he doesn't really have to sit here<br> and take this beating.<br> He can do something about it.<br> Which is what?<br> Have his corner throw in the towel?<br> - Or fight back.<br> - Get back.<br> You can see his power.<br> Every time he hits Ward,<br> he backs him up.<br> How about taking points away from him?<br> Larry, unless<br> the referee does, you can't.<br> The referee should just go<br> ahead and stop this fight.<br> He knows that Micky doesn't want<br> to be here. I wouldn't even make...<br> He's fightin' scared, Dick.<br> Runnin' away, not hittin' back.<br> Oh, Jesus. He's gonna get hurt.<br> Doing that same old shit.<br> They never seen such<br> an embarrassing performance.<br> He's doing what I told him, Ma.<br> He's doing what I told him.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> He's doing what I told him.<br> Micky Ward, showing nothing<br> but respect.<br> What are you runnin' around for?<br> Stop running around!<br> Shut the fuck up, Sal!<br> Shut the fuck up!<br> I don't know what you're doing, Micky.<br> Want to fuckin' tell me?<br> 'Cause I don't know what you're doing.<br> We have lost all five rounds,<br> is that what you want?<br> Dreadful.<br> This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.<br> You gotta show me something soon,<br> Mick, or I'm gonna stop the fight.<br> Now they're gonna stop the fight, Micky.<br> He's gotta go inside, Ma.<br> He's gotta take it to the body.<br> He's gotta.<br> Come on, get your punches up...<br> - Don't stop the fight.<br> - They're gonna stop this fight.<br> Then you gotta do something, baby.<br> That's not what we talked about, Micky.<br> We had a plan and you're<br> not doing it. Now, let's go.<br> All right, Micky.<br> You've lost the first five rounds.<br> What's the next strategy gonna be?<br> Double right hand by Sanchez,<br> then a triple left hook.<br> A couple of the left hooks landed<br> flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.<br> Ward tying Sanchez up.<br> Very curious performance<br> by Micky Ward.<br> Come on, Micky, come on!<br> Ward seems...<br> trying to land one big shot<br> to change Sanchez's mind...<br> And he's beginning to open up.<br> Taking advantage of more and more<br> opportunities to get close to Ward<br> and throw against a fighter...<br> Time!<br> ...who's not defending himself<br> by punching.<br> Sanchez is gonna try<br> to end this fight.<br> - What are you doing? Come on!<br> - That's it.<br> Good boy!<br> He's down on an uppercut!<br> - Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.<br> ...three, four, five...<br> And right after Ward threw<br> a pretty good right hand.<br> Mick, you all right?<br> Come to me. Come to me.<br> This is a fight<br> that should be stopped.<br> Come on, head, body, head.<br> This is not professional.<br> That's exactly what I'm saying.<br> - Punch him! You gotta punch!<br> - Someone should pay me to watch this.<br> Come on, man! Head, body, head!<br> That was a good body shot by Ward.<br> That was good.<br> Maybe it'll turn him around.<br> Maybe. I'm talking about if I...<br> Sanchez drops<br> like he's shot! Oh, my God!<br> The most unlikely<br> knockout you have ever seen.<br> That was a kidney shot,<br> the kind of kidney shot...<br> ...nine, ten!<br> I still don't believe<br> what I just saw.<br> Oh, Micky won!<br> Now, did Micky Ward<br> just make idiots of us all<br> with a spectacular piece of strategy?<br> Take another look. Amazing.<br> A brilliant win in the career<br> of Micky Ward out of Lowell, Mass.<br> Unbelievable defeat<br> at the hands of Micky Ward,<br> who had all but given away the first<br> half-dozen rounds of the battle.<br> I think what Micky did was he recognized<br> that he'd hurt the guy<br> with the body shot.<br> Micky's a better fighter than that to<br> not be runnin' from that guy like that.<br> Theater of the unexpected.<br> Hey, you never know<br> what can happen, right?<br> Never give up in this game, right?<br> Never give up.<br> You can't make it up, folks.<br> You hear what he said?<br> He said, "You can't give up<br> in this game."<br> Well, maybe Micky Ward<br> heard me say you should stop this fight<br> and he went out and stopped it.<br> - Right there. Right there.<br> - Yeah! I can't believe it.<br> I'm lookin' over, and I'm thinkin'<br> to myself like they were thinkin':<br> This thing is over.<br> But I tell you what, if you<br> looked at the commentators,<br> they started to take their headsets off<br> before he was even counted out.<br> Theyjust wanted to get out of there.<br> Mick, Mick.<br> I just spoke to Mike Toma.<br> - He told me something very interesting.<br> - Holy shit, what?<br> He just told me,<br> had Sanchez won tonight,<br> he would've gotten the title shot.<br> - Holy Christ, that's beautiful.<br> - Why? Why is that beautiful?<br> - A title shot. Mick gets the shot.<br> - Micky gets the shot!<br> - Are you kidding me?<br> - Are you sure about that?<br> I just spoke to the guy. Mike!<br> Come here, Mike. Look, tell these guys.<br> - Hey, Mike Toma. Thank you.<br> - Congratulations.<br> You're not a stepping stone anymore.<br> I always knew you had the talent.<br> That was a hell of a strategy, wearing<br> him down and taking it to the body.<br> Thirty years in the business,<br> I'd never seen a knockout like that.<br> Larry Merchant was writing<br> your obituary,<br> and Sanchez drops<br> like he's shot with a gun.<br> Where'd you get that?<br> That's the first thing<br> my brother taught me.<br> Tap 'em to the head,<br> ding 'em to the body.<br> - That's a hell of a body shot.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You ready for a title shot?<br> - I ain't gettin' no younger.<br> Thanks, Mr. Toma. Thank you.<br> He's ready. You're ready, aren't ya?<br> Shea Neary in London<br> for the title.<br> Are you kidding,<br> we got some celebrating to do.<br> - Yeah, I think so.<br> - Thank you so much.<br> - Gonna have a great champ in my boy.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Toma.<br> It's what your brother<br> would've always wanted.<br> He's not even gonna be there.<br> - Hey!<br> - Daddy!<br> - Come here, buddy.<br> - Daddy, Daddy!<br> Good to see you!<br> That's a good hug!<br> That's a good hug! Yeah!<br> - Sweetheart.<br> - Hey, Ma.<br> Oh, you look so good. Oh, my God.<br> - You have clean teeth.<br> - I do! Look at my teeth!<br> I got new teeth. Everything.<br> How you think I look?<br> - Good.<br> - Yeah?<br> Cake and more cake.<br> - Ice cream?<br> - Ice cream and cake.<br> Ice cream and cake and cake. Right?<br> Ice cream, cake and cake.<br> Ice cream, cake and cake...<br> Quacka!<br> Ma.<br> - They gave you some new teeth, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey, Georgie. What, they let<br> you outta the house now?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Lettin' him outta the house, Ma?<br> Hey, look, I want you<br> to meet Sal Lonano.<br> How you doing, Dicky?<br> Let's spar.<br> Hey, Charlene.<br> Welcome back!<br> It's supposed to be a surprise.<br> You're late.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> Mick, I can't even tell you, being in<br> this smelly-ass locker room. You know?<br> Being back with you,<br> this is what got me through.<br> - You look good. Your eyes are clear.<br> - Yeah. You know...<br> ...Alice says prison might've<br> been the best thing for me.<br> Got me clean. Got me clear. Up here.<br> It's a beautiful thing, Dick.<br> - I gotta talk to you about something.<br> - Yeah.<br> Look at this locker.<br> The old locker.<br> I love it. Fuckin' love it.<br> I made a promise to them<br> I wouldn't work with you again.<br> I had to. After everything<br> that happened, I'm sorry.<br> You stickin' to that?<br> I'm glad you're back. You look good.<br> I don't know what else to say.<br> - Mick, you fuckin' kidding me?<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - Oh, hey, Mick.<br> - Come on, come on!<br> You gotta... Ma. You gotta<br> do this at home. Please?<br> What are you talkin' about?<br> What's the matter?<br> Mom, please?<br> All right, girls. Let's pack it up.<br> I know. We'll see him at home.<br> - What the hell?<br> - Would you please pack it up?<br> - Why?<br> - Let's get it put away.<br> If that's what Micky wants,<br> we're gonna put it away.<br> - There's your brother.<br> - Dicky...<br> - How ya doing?<br> - Micky?<br> That's nice. That's nice.<br> We've been working on it<br> for two weeks.<br> Sherri, come on, stop it.<br> All right, girls,<br> come on, let's go home.<br> It's not the time to do this,<br> obviously. Come on.<br> You stay here.<br> What the hell's going on?<br> - What's going on?<br> - We ain't gonna work together.<br> He don't want me to work with him.<br> What're you talking about?<br> That's not right.<br> Micky never would've won<br> Sanchez without Dicky.<br> That's fuckin' bullshit! Take it back!<br> Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you fuckin'<br> talk to my mother that way.<br> - Fuck you!<br> - Fuck you!<br> Take 'em home.<br> Why don't you ask Micky?<br> If we're gonna train, they gotta go.<br> They gotta go, Mick, come on.<br> Ask him, George. Ask him if he would've<br> won Sanchez without his brother?<br> Hey, take him outside, all right?<br> No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez<br> if it wasn't for Dicky.<br> How can you say that to O'Keefe?<br> Because it's true.<br> I went with that game plan,<br> it wasn't working.<br> So I went back to what<br> I learned with Dicky.<br> And I wouldn't have won without you,<br> either, O'Keefe, OK?<br> I mean, you know that.<br> We worked hard. You got me ready.<br> You got your confidence<br> and your focus from O'Keefe,<br> and from Sal and<br> your father and from me.<br> - Dicky's a junk bag.<br> - Hey.<br> He's a junk bag!<br> - Fuck you, Charlene.<br> - Fuck you.<br> - I'm eight months sober.<br> - Oh, yeah,<br> and I'm sure you're gonna need<br> something now that you're out.<br> "Oh, my back. Oh, my back."<br> - Fuck you always picking on me for?<br> - No, fuck you!<br> And what about O'Keefe?<br> We're in the same boat.<br> One day at a fucking time, right,<br> O'Keefe? You know what I mean?<br> What, it's all right<br> for him to be here?<br> Why am I the fuckin' problem?<br> I'm his blood, I'm his family!<br> - You are the problem!<br> - I'm the one fighting, OK?<br> Not you, not you, and not you.<br> - I know what I need.<br> - And you need Dicky?<br> I want Dicky back.<br> And I want you, Charlene.<br> And I want O'Keefe.<br> I want my family.<br> What's wrong with that?<br> It's not the deal we made, baby.<br> She's right, Micky.<br> That's not the deal.<br> It wasn't the deal.<br> Come on, you can't do this to us.<br> - You sound like them now.<br> - I sound like them now?<br> - Yeah, you sound like them.<br> - You sound like them.<br> How could I do this to you?<br> "You can't do that to us.<br> He can't do that to us."<br> You sound like them.<br> You should fuckin' listen to yourself.<br> You sound like them and maybe<br> this is where you belong.<br> That's the way you love him?<br> - Charlene!<br> - Come on!<br> - You wanted your brother? Good luck.<br> - O'Keefe, come on.<br> - Mickey.<br> - Mickey.<br> Come on, everything<br> happens for a reason.<br> You know? Maybe it's for the best.<br> God has a plan.<br> Wanna spar with your brother?<br> Dick Eklund, pride of Lowell!<br> Watching that for years, huh?<br> Micky, Micky!<br> Whoa, hey!<br> What the hell are you doing?<br> Micky!<br> - Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!<br> - For crying out loud!<br> Take that baby out of here.<br> I told you take him away<br> ten minutes ago!<br> Sweetheart, you all right?<br> You OK? Your back?<br> What are you doing?<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Can this be my fight, Alice?<br> Just once?<br> Maybe just this one time<br> not for Dicky?<br> I know you think he's coming back.<br> He's 40 years old and doesn't<br> have a tooth in his head<br> - that's his fuckin' own.<br> - I'll go fuckin' ten rounds.<br> Let your brother talk<br> for a minute here, all right?<br> - What are you sayin', sweetheart?<br> - I'm Shea Neary...<br> Shut up before I bust your<br> fuckin' head open, Dicky.<br> - Hey, hey...<br> - What're you gonna do? I'm Shea Neary.<br> You want me to bust<br> your fuckin' head open?<br> Come on, come on! George, please!<br> - Dicky!<br> - Please! What are you saying?<br> - Tell me what you're saying.<br> - This is supposed to be my fight.<br> This is my shot at a title.<br> I won't get another one after this.<br> - Am I being selfish?<br> - No.<br> Am I saying, "Micky, Micky, Micky?"<br> You know what? If I am, I'm sorry.<br> I thought I was fightin'<br> for the championship.<br> And I thought you<br> were my mother, too.<br> I am your mother.<br> Yeah, Ma.<br> Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea<br> you felt like that, all right?<br> If I made mistakes,<br> I'm gonna be better.<br> I don't wanna hurt you.<br> I am so sorry. I'm sorry.<br> Dicky!<br> Stay with him.<br> Dicky... Dicky!<br> - Dicky!<br> - Gotta do something.<br> Dicky, wait, come on!<br> - Micky wants you! I want you!<br> - I gotta do something.<br> I know what that means.<br> Don't do this!<br> Hey, Chan.<br> - What's going on?<br> - Hey, Dicky.<br> Hey, Dicky's back!<br> Hey!<br> Look at you!<br> What's up, my boy?<br> How you doing? Good to see you, man.<br> - You look good. Welcome back.<br> - Yeah, you're looking good.<br> - Great.<br> - Good to see ya.<br> - Welcome home.<br> - Hi, honey.<br> What's up, man?<br> You're looking good.<br> - Wanna head upstairs?<br> - Dicky's back.<br> - Hi, Dicky. We're gonna party.<br> - Go upstairs, man?<br> - Go upstairs, take a while?<br> - We missed you!<br> - Let's go, buddy.<br> - Come on, Dicky.<br> - Make for a little party for you...<br> - Hey, come back.<br> - What the fuck's that all about?<br> - What the hell was that?<br> Charlene? It's Dicky.<br> Get off my porch,<br> you piece of shit.<br> How fuckin' dare you...<br> ...cocksucker...<br> ...fuckin'...<br> You're a fuckin' asshole, Dicky.<br> I want you off my fuckin' porch!<br> Why don't you just fuckin'<br> come down here and talk to me?<br> Such an asshole, coming to my<br> fucking house. You piece of shit!<br> - Standing on my porch...<br> - Charlene...<br> It's not fuckin' lady-like to be<br> shoutin' in the street like this.<br> You're such a fuckin' cocksucker<br> coming over here.<br> - Please?<br> - Oh, yeah, you think I fuckin' care?<br> - Come on, just fuckin'...<br> - Get off my fuckin' porch, Dicky!<br> Would you just fuckin'<br> come down here... and talk to me?<br> What kind of dog is that?<br> Is that a Cocker Spaniel?<br> All right, I know you<br> can't fuckin' stand me.<br> Really, what makes you say that?<br> I ain't got no use for you, either.<br> All right? But my brother loves ya.<br> And you can't just<br> run away because of me.<br> He don't deserve that. All right?<br> So I will quit if you want me to quit.<br> - You're full of shit.<br> - I swear to God.<br> I will quit if it means<br> you'll come back, all right?<br> But I want you to think about something.<br> Micky has a chance to do<br> something that I never did.<br> That in my time, I never had.<br> "Oh, yeah, my big chance<br> was with Sugar Ray Leonard.<br> I'm so great.<br> I'm the pride of fuckin' Lowell.<br> Oh, yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."<br> I've heard it.<br> I came here to make things right.<br> - OK, let's make things right.<br> - Yeah.<br> Number one: You didn't knock down<br> Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.<br> I was in the ring. Don't you think<br> I know what really happened that day?<br> All right? What have you<br> ever done with your life?<br> - I like my life.<br> - Yeah, what you ever done with it?<br> - I like my life now, Dicky.<br> - What have you done with your life?<br> You're a college dropout, Charlene.<br> You're just a little bar girl.<br> Your life sucks.<br> All right. I drank too much.<br> I worked in a lot of bars.<br> And I ruined a lot of opportunities, but<br> I'm trying to do something better here.<br> - And so is Micky.<br> - And so am I.<br> And he needs me. You heard him.<br> And I know he needs you.<br> What is that blue shit on your arm?<br> It's icing.<br> OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner.<br> Otherwise, go fuck yourself.<br> - It's a deal.<br> - All right? It's a deal.<br> We worked it out for you. Ask her.<br> Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.<br> I will.<br> Hey, Mick...<br> You think I knocked down<br> Sugar Ray Leonard?<br> Went ten rounds. One of the best<br> ever and he couldn't hurt you.<br> You were my hero.<br> I was.<br> I was.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You are?<br> There's a press conference downstairs.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Spot of tea, mate!<br> Neary: Ten stone... six pound.<br> Ward: Ten stone... six pound.<br> Hey, Micky, Micky Ward!<br> We have a question over here.<br> - How you been training?<br> - I train, I train hard.<br> Shea's 22 and 0.<br> He's never been knocked down.<br> - That's gonna change tomorrow.<br> - In fact, we expected<br> a much better fighter.<br> I'm just grateful to be here<br> and have the opportunity.<br> Thank you guys for the shot.<br> Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?<br> And who would you like to fight next?<br> I plan on moving right<br> through Micky Ward tomorrow.<br> Moving on to other great fighters,<br> like Gatti.<br> Yeah, I believe Gatti and I<br> would make a great match.<br> Are you scared, Mr. Ward?<br> And now, ladies and<br> gentlemen, 12 rounds of boxing<br> for the WBU Welterweight<br> Championship of the World!<br> I can't see!<br> Here I go again on my own<br> Goin' down the only road<br> I've ever known<br> Like a drifter<br> I was born to walk alone<br> - Hey, fellas, let's go.<br> - I made up my mind<br> I ain't wasting no more time<br> Here I go again on my own<br> Going down the only road<br> I've ever known<br> Like a drifter I was born<br> to walk alone<br> Don't listen to 'em, Mick.<br> I made up my mind<br> I ain't wasting no more time...<br> And there is Micky Ward<br> of Lowell, Massachusetts,<br> entering the ring. It's his<br> first fight outside the United States.<br> Micky Ward: 30 wins, seven losses.<br> He's gotten better recently, 20 KOs.<br> And now Ward awaits his<br> opponent, Shea Neary.<br> Neary regards himself<br> as the European Arturo Gatti.<br> Meaning that he is a head-on,<br> high-contact fighter<br> who throws 70 punches per round.<br> Neary's from Liverpool<br> and should have<br> a huge following here tonight.<br> Accompanied<br> by Paint the Town Red by The Mahones.<br> Neary is the current<br> Welterweight Champion of the World.<br> He is a very tough young man.<br> Beyond dedicated.<br> Lives a Spartan existence.<br> And according to his promoters,<br> does nothing but eat,<br> drink, think, fantasize...<br> ...dream of fighting.<br> Shea Neary has had 22<br> professional fights and won them all.<br> Seventeen KOs.<br> Come out when you hear the bell.<br> Don't piss about. Shake hands.<br> Both of ya... shake hands!<br> As close as we just saw<br> them in the middle of the ring,<br> - forehead to forehead,<br> - Did you see that?<br> That's how close we expect them to be<br> for as long as this fight goes on.<br> Ward is a long ways from home.<br> Don't coast in a foreign country.<br> Well, the big challenge for Ward<br> is to get off to a faster start<br> than is customary for him.<br> Micky Ward, a notoriously<br> slow starter in big fights,<br> Shea Neary, an ultra-fast starter.<br> And that's the question<br> that hovers over round one.<br> Will Ward be ready for the fight?<br> Already, Shea Neary starts<br> taking it to him on the ropes!<br> And Neary going to the body,<br> which is Ward's specialty.<br> Neary bangs Ward to the body.<br> And a big uppercut by Neary.<br> Neary leads off with a good left jab.<br> - Come on, Micky!<br> - Keeps Ward off balance,<br> jabbing here and there.<br> There's a good left hook<br> by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.<br> Ward not able to deal with him very well<br> when Neary stands at range like this.<br> - Come on!<br> - That's it! Get him!<br> And a left hook<br> lands up top from Micky Ward.<br> Neary digging his<br> own right hand to the body.<br> They trade shots at close range.<br> Ward, he's trying<br> to match Neary blow for blow<br> and now Neary starts to come on and<br> take the last 30 seconds of the round...<br> How about that?<br> Break!<br> Tremendous barrage in<br> the first minute. Just look at this.<br> - Unbelievable.<br> - What a great round one!<br> Ward is gonna have<br> to pick up the tempo<br> and beat him with volumes of punching.<br> No doubt, Neary is a better boxer.<br> Four hard right hands...<br> Neary has belted in the last minute.<br> Quicker than Ward,<br> more assertive than Ward,<br> surer of what he wants to do.<br> They're standing and trading shots<br> at the center of the ring.<br> Ward's gonna have<br> to step it up a little bit more<br> than he is right now.<br> Micky Ward's corner<br> taking a real deep look<br> at what's going on now.<br> And his family at ringside well aware<br> he's stepping up in class.<br> Ward has fallen to the pedal.<br> He's gotta be more aggressive.<br> He can't just try to wait<br> until everything is perfect.<br> His dominance over Micky Ward<br> is increasing as the fight goes on<br> because his technical plan<br> was the right one and he's executing it.<br> Punches like these make it seem...<br> ...that it's now Neary's fight.<br> Ward hasn't been in this kind of war<br> with this strong of fighter as Neary.<br> They are trying<br> to hurt each other with every punch.<br> They've tested each other's will,<br> now they're testing each other's skill.<br> And Ward wobbled there<br> by a right cross from Neary!<br> Ward hurting now. His legs are gone.<br> Neary goes to the body<br> as he tries to finish Micky.<br> Vicious body shots from Neary.<br> And Ward still doesn't<br> even try to move off the ropes!<br> I don't know if he can, Jim.<br> He's waiting for Neary<br> to punch himself out.<br> Down goes Micky Ward! He may be out.<br> That ain't fuckin' it!<br> - One... two...<br> - Come on! That's it!<br> - That's my boy!<br> - Forward! Forward! Come on!<br> Ward is out on his feet.<br> Loser! Go back to America!<br> - This could be it for Micky Ward.<br> - Dicky, give him the fuckin' stool.<br> Charlene, will you get<br> the fuck outta here.<br> He needs to fuckin' sit down!<br> His brother's got<br> Ward jumping to wake up his legs.<br> I think this could be Ward's last chance<br> to turn this fight around.<br> It's Micky Ward<br> against the aggressiveness<br> and clean punching of Shea Neary.<br> If you don't have your defense up,<br> you can really get hurt.<br> He's making it very<br> difficult for Micky Ward.<br> I don't think he's gonna<br> get into it at this rate.<br> This is a survival mode...<br> Are you like me? Was just<br> good enough to fight Sugar Ray?<br> Never had to win, did I?<br> You gotta do more in there.<br> You gotta win a title.<br> For you, for me, for Lowell.<br> This is your time, all right?<br> You take it.<br> I had my time and I blew it.<br> You don't have to.<br> All right?<br> You fuckin' get out there,<br> and use all the shit<br> that you've been through,<br> all the shit we've gone through<br> over the fuckin' years<br> and you put it in that ring right now.<br> This is yours. This is fuckin' yours.<br> OK. Fuckin' head, body, head, body.<br> Say it back to me.<br> Fuckin' say it back to me.<br> - Head, body, head, body.<br> - Head, body, head, body.<br> Get in your mind this is<br> fucking yours. Fuckin' do it.<br> Stay off the fuckin' ropes.<br> If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,<br> I thinking if he doesn't pick things up<br> this round and get going,<br> he'll just get totally wiped out.<br> Off the ropes!<br> Get off the ropes, Mick!<br> Once again, Ward against<br> the ropes as Neary is free to attack.<br> What are you doing? Come on, Mick!<br> Sometimes if you wanna win,<br> you gotta be something that you're not.<br> Come on!<br> Off the fuckin' ropes, Mick,<br> that ain't it!<br> Neary continues to pound away.<br> Don't take no abuse!<br> This is your time Micky! It's up to you!<br> - Two big misses by Neary!<br> - That's it! That's it!<br> Ward seemingly getting his legs back.<br> He backs Neary off.<br> - Ward trades his way back.<br> - That's it!<br> Ward nods as if to say,<br> "Come on!"<br> "Come on, let's fight!"<br> Just imagine if you bought a ticket.<br> Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.<br> This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.<br> And a left hook to the body<br> and an uppercut lands<br> - and now he backs Neary off.<br> - Head, body, head fuckin' body!<br> Ward hurt Neary with a body shot.<br> Ward hurts him again<br> with that left to the body.<br> Oh, and that one plants<br> Neary on his butt.<br> First time in 23 professional fights<br> - that Shea Neary has been down.<br> - This is it! This is it!<br> This is it, Micky!<br> Keep going! Don't look at me for it!<br> Take it to him!<br> - Come on, Micky, get in there!<br> - Ward lands a huge left hook!<br> As Micky Ward pounds away!<br> Goes to the body with the left hook!<br> Lands the uppercut again!<br> Neary down for the second time.<br> Mickey Vann's gonna stop it there.<br> "Irish" Micky Ward<br> with a big eight-round TKO!<br> He's done it again.<br> He's done it again.<br> The grinding, gutty Micky Ward<br> pulls out another big victory!<br> You're the champion of the world, Mick!<br> You're the fuckin' champ of the world!<br> You fuckin' did it!<br> Oh, you're the best!<br> - Oh, I love you!<br> - My boy's the champion of the world!<br> I love you!<br> This town always said,<br> you're a fuckin' boxer, right?<br> He thought he was a piece of shit. He<br> put Lowell back on the map, you know?<br> - We.<br> - I tell ya...<br> - We.<br> - No, but hold on.<br> Who used to be the pride of Lowell?<br> Right here.<br> Who's the pride of Lowell now?<br> Right there.<br> That's how it's meant to be, you know?<br> Handin' it down to him.<br> Nothin' better than that.<br> Nothin' better than that.<br> He did it. I gotta go.<br> I gotta go.<br> Oh, look at cabbage head. Boo Boo!<br> Quacka!<br> - What's up buddy?<br> - Boo, where's your teeth?<br> Oh, I'm under arrest!<br> Let's go, move it out!<br> It's been real, ain't it?<br> It's been real, it's been unreal.<br> It's been a great experience.<br> Just glad it's done, finally,<br> and thanks to everyone so much,<br> from the bottom of my heart.<br> Thanks so much,<br> all you Hollywood people.<br> Now you know what I mean<br> when I say I can't get a word in.<br> I'm telling ya.<br> He'll never get a word in.<br> - All right, thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Thanks, everybody.<br>
