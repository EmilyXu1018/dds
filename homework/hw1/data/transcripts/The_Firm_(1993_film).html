                        Stroke! Stroke!<br> Come on, come on.<br> Pick him up, pick him up.<br> Son of a bitch!<br> I mean, Your Honor,<br> that was a hell of a shot.<br> Well, I'm currently doing an externship<br> for two extra credits<br> as a clerk for Judge Hookstratten.<br> B. J. Hookstratten?<br> That's more impressive<br> than being in the top 5%.<br> Look, I don't know what kind of offers<br> you've had from Wall Street...<br> The top five, sir. In my class.<br> Not the top 5%. I'm sorry, I just...<br> Mr. McDeere, we've just offered you<br> $68,000 a year<br> from arguably<br> the leading law firm in Chicago.<br> Is there somewhere else<br> you have to be?<br> Yes, sir. I have a job.<br> I'm just on lunch break.<br> I know you've had a lot of offers.<br> Did you know, for example,<br> that we have 127 clients<br> that are Fortune 500 companies?<br> Now, look, we'll offer you $74,000...<br> ...our billing requirement for a<br> first-year associate is only 2,000 hours,<br> not the usual 25 or 26 or 2,700.<br> We want you<br> to have a life outside the office, Mitch.<br> And if you're a Lakers fan,<br> we have a fabulous box at the Forum.<br> I know there are firms<br> from all over the country<br> that have been up here<br> offering you everything.<br> But with your ability and ambition,<br> there is only one place for you,<br> and that's with our firm in Washington...<br> Let's stop talking about<br> the ribbon on the package,<br> and start talking about<br> what's in the package.<br> One of our partners is an ex-governor,<br> two are congressmen<br> and one's a former<br> Senator of Agriculture.<br> May I take your coat, sir?<br> - Mitchell McDeere, right?<br> - Yes.<br> Lamar Quinn. Come on in.<br> I'd like you to meet<br> - Oliver Lambert, our senior partner.<br> - Mitch. Mitch.<br> - How do you do, sir?<br> - This is Royce McKnight,<br> - our managing partner.<br> - How do you do, sir?<br> - Welcome.<br> - Care for a drink?<br> - No, I'm fine.<br> - Take a seat, Mitch.<br> Tired of interviews?<br> No, sir.<br> I just don't quite know what to say.<br> Unusual for a lawyer.<br> I can get tongue-tied<br> in any number of situations, sir,<br> but it's usually with my wife.<br> Would you mind describing one,<br> with your wife?<br> The first time I saw her.<br> Any time we argue.<br> Whenever she walks into a room,<br> as a matter of fact.<br> Might we ask<br> about the rest of your family?<br> My father was killed in the coal mines<br> and my mother remarried<br> and lives in Florida.<br> Brothers and sisters?<br> None.<br> Mitch, I hope<br> you don't think us intrusive,<br> but stability in the family<br> has a special importance for us.<br> Bendini, Lambert & Locke<br> is just a small Memphis firm,<br> 41 lawyers.<br> But we're a large family.<br> So we're careful.<br> Now, sir,<br> do you have any questions for us?<br> Do you have an offer in mind?<br> It includes a bonus schedule,<br> a low-interest mortgage<br> so you can buy a home,<br> country club membership,<br> and we'll lease you a new Mercedes.<br> You pick the color, Mitch.<br> Lamar, you haven't been<br> paying attention.<br> His wife picks the color.<br> - Do I... Do I open it here?<br> - Of course.<br> Unless you can tell us what's in it.<br> A lawyer worth that offer<br> shouldn't have to open the envelope.<br> Mr. McKnight, you are<br> the managing partner<br> at Bendini, Lambert & Locke,<br> is that correct?<br> Yes.<br> Did Mr. Lambert, as senior partner,<br> give you any instructions<br> regarding my employment?<br> He did.<br> And, Mr. McKnight, do you usually<br> follow Mr. Lambert's instructions?<br> Objection. Vague. Ambiguous.<br> Sustained.<br> What precisely were those instructions?<br> That you were in great demand,<br> and I should make certain<br> that we obtained your services<br> before a bidding situation developed.<br> How did you go about making certain?<br> I bribed a clerk<br> in the Harvard Law placement office<br> for the exact amount<br> of the highest offer,<br> and then added 20%.<br> Mitch, the letter you got<br> from Bendini, Lambert & Locke<br> was the only one sent out. We want you.<br> Okay.<br> You're gonna have to leave now.<br> I'm expecting my husband.<br> The hell with him.<br> Come here.<br> Moo shu pork, Szechwan beef,<br> mandarin duck from Wong Boys.<br> It's even got a cork.<br> What's going on?<br> You remember the letter I got<br> from that firm in Memphis?<br> Memphis?<br> That's what I thought, until their offer.<br> What was the offer?<br> They didn't say. It's in there.<br> It's sealed.<br> I guessed.<br> What?<br> Yeah, but I'm a good guesser.<br> Plus a 5% increase the second year.<br> Why?<br> "Why?" Whose side are you on anyway?<br> Yours.<br> Plus bonuses,<br> plus a low interest mortgage...<br> As in a home, with grass around it?<br> They want to fly us down to Memphis<br> for a little visit.<br> If you've been in one limo,<br> you've been in them all.<br> Bye. See you later, Your Honor.<br> Sir.<br> Hey, Mitch.<br> Come on, associates first,<br> then lunch with the partners<br> in our private dining room.<br> He's our number one draft pick,<br> so to speak,<br> and he's being romanced<br> by the big boys<br> from New York and Chicago<br> and everywhere else,<br> so we have to sell him on<br> our little firm here in Memphis.<br> Meanwhile, he's gonna try<br> not to be embarrassed<br> while I remind you that he's about to<br> graduate from Harvard with honors.<br> Hear, hear.<br> No one's divorced in the Firm?<br> No one's divorced in the Firm.<br> - Impossible.<br> - No bachelors either.<br> What about women?<br> - They had one once.<br> - Only one?<br> Alice Krauss,<br> wobbled around on 4" heels.<br> Affirmative action on stilts.<br> All white, all male, all married, huh?<br> - What the hell is this?<br> - There he goes.<br> Hey!<br> It's different from the northeast.<br> The pace, we're almost stately<br> by comparison.<br> Courteous and not as gossipy.<br> We keep each other's secrets.<br> I like that.<br> What do you like about it?<br> All of it. It's a family.<br> Just the way you said.<br> For the last three years,<br> I've been teaching in the Boston area<br> at a private school.<br> Do you work?<br> Well, not since<br> I put Lamar through law school.<br> But, you know, working isn't forbidden.<br> - Forbidden?<br> - Working, by the Firm, you know.<br> - How could it be forbidden?<br> - It isn't.<br> Anyway, two babies in 14 months<br> and I had all the work I could handle.<br> - Do you plan to start a family?<br> - Maybe in a couple of years.<br> The Firm encourages children.<br> How do they do that exactly?<br> Hey, how about it?<br> How about it.<br> Okay, okay. The Love Boat band,<br> the secret recipe ribs,<br> they're a little square maybe...<br> I don't mind square. I like square.<br> Weird, I mind.<br> What do you mean, "weird"?<br> Well, here's a quote.<br> "The Firm does not forbid me to take<br> a job, and they encourage children."<br> Ask me why.<br> Because they love kids.<br> Because children promote stability.<br> Want to hear more?<br> No, you're right.<br> Don't pay any attention. I'm just gonna<br> throw myself over the rail.<br> - I think my will is self-explanatory.<br> - Okay, okay, okay.<br> These are nice people, Abby.<br> These are nice people. Okay.<br> I'm more impressed with it than you are.<br> You grew up with it.<br> Do you know<br> what $96,000 a year is here?<br> It's like 150 in New York.<br> Did you ever think<br> I'd make a six-figure salary?<br> Absolutely.<br> You did?<br> Well, your folks! Your folks<br> are only a few hours away, too.<br> You mean, if we fight,<br> I don't have far to drive.<br> Exactly.<br> She made two phone calls<br> from the hotel,<br> one to her parents<br> and one to the Memphis School Board.<br> She seemed a little reluctant.<br> I'd hate to lose this young man.<br> I think she'll come around.<br> What about Kozinski and Hodges?<br> Have you spoken to Chicago?<br> I have.<br> It's not good.<br> We're gonna have to do something.<br> I drew the happy face.<br> Where's Memphis?<br> Is that it?<br> - Yeah?<br> - It looks different.<br> It's prettier than the pictures they sent.<br> "Mitch and Abby, we've taken the liberty<br> of furnishing the house temporarily.<br> "Just a few things<br> to make you feel at home.<br> "Hope you don't mind."<br> Abby!<br> Not bad, huh?<br> Where's yours?<br> - Don't get up.<br> - Don't worry.<br> Mitchell McDeere.<br> Tad eager are we, Mr. McDeere?<br> What are you doing?<br> Dutch says you've been here since 6:30.<br> I thought<br> I'd jump start the bar exam work.<br> Good.

I'll show you your new office.<br> Wally Hudson, Contracts.<br> - Here to help with the bar exam.<br> - Thanks, Wally.<br> No associate of the Firm<br> has ever failed the bar exam.<br> The first day<br> is a four-hour multiple choice on ethics.<br> Look at the first six chapters.<br> I'll see you Wednesday, 8:45.<br> Oh, no associate of this firm<br> has ever failed the bar exam.<br> No kidding.<br> - Ken Curry. Domestic Relations.<br> - Mike Allen. Wills and Estates.<br> Nina.<br> Fuck! Please.<br> I'm sorry. Can I help you?<br> Actually, I think I'm here to help you.<br> I'm Avery Tolar,<br> your designated mentor.<br> Let's go to lunch.<br> Lunch? But it's not even...<br> Not even noon, I know.<br> It will be a working lunch.<br> Come on up to my office<br> while I drop this off.<br> Everything depends on billing.<br> How many hours you spend<br> even thinking about a client.<br> I don't care if you're stuck in traffic<br> or shaving or sitting on a park bench.<br> Now, my particular field...<br> Is forming limited partnerships<br> for offshore corporations,<br> mainly in the Cayman Islands.<br> Good. I want you to review the last one<br> I did for a client named Sonny Capps.<br> He made over 14 million last year,<br> paid less than 4% in taxes<br> and resents every buck of it.<br> But he paid us $400,000 in fees,<br> so I don't want to make him unhappy.<br> Take a look at the deal,<br> see if you can come up with anything.<br> Madge, tell him<br> I'll call him in the morning, please.<br> Yes, Mr. Tolar.<br> Should I save these for later?<br> - Could you, please?<br> - What do you mean by "anything"?<br> What do you think I mean?<br> I don't know, you're the risk taker.<br> Do you think<br> I'm talking about breaking the law?<br> No, I'm just trying to figure out<br> how far you want it bent.<br> As far as you can without breaking it.<br> In other words, don't risk an IRS audit.<br> I don't give a damn about an audit.<br> They just better not win.<br> Yes, Mr. Tolar?<br> Something before lunch?<br> I should warn you the Firm frowns<br> on drinking during office hours.<br> Iced tea, please.<br> Bombay martini on the rocks, Ellis,<br> three olives.<br> On the way.<br> Senator.<br> I'm allowed a few minor rebellions.<br> - Put that in the bedroom, please.<br> - Hey, hon, I made you some tea.<br> Kay, please. I've never had so many<br> people trying to do things for me.<br> It's the South, Abby.<br> We encumber you with hospitality.<br> Would you like to have your phone<br> programmed for speed dialing, ma'am?<br> Other than my husband's office number,<br> let's see, that's...<br> We have it, Mrs. McDeere.<br> We do all the installations for the Firm.<br> What led you to law school?<br> - I can't remember, really.<br> - Sure you can, Counselor.<br> I was a delivery boy for a pizza parlor.<br> One day the owner<br> got a notice from the IRS.<br> He was an immigrant,<br> didn't know much English,<br> even less about withholding tax.<br> He went bankrupt. Lost his store.<br> That was the first time<br> I thought of being a lawyer.<br> In other words, you're an idealist.<br> I don't know any tax lawyer<br> who's an idealist.<br> When he lost his store, I lost my job,<br> and it scared me.<br> - Being out of work?<br> - No.<br> What the government<br> can do to anybody.<br> What about you?<br> What led you to law school?<br> It's so far back<br> I don't think I can remember.<br> Sure you can, Counselor.<br> I used to caddie for young lawyers<br> off from work on weekdays<br> and their wives.<br> I'd look at those long tan legs<br> and just knew I had to be a lawyer.<br> The wives had long tan legs, too.<br> Ellis, another martini, please.<br> So we're not a couple of idealists.<br> Heaven forbid.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> I'll let Mrs. Quinn know you're here.<br> - Are you sure it's today?<br> - That's what he told me.<br> Kay?<br> There's been...<br> Marty Kozinski and Joe Hodges<br> were killed.<br> We just got word about 20 minutes ago.<br> Did you meet them at the barbecue?<br> What happened, Kay?<br> We're not sure.<br> They were diving off a boat<br> on Grand Cayman,<br> and then there was<br> some kind of explosion on the boat.<br> Lamar?<br> Marty was...<br> His twin girls<br> are a month older than our son.<br> I'm very sorry, Lamar.<br> By the way,<br> Oliver wanted me to tell you,<br> you shouldn't be burdened<br> with a student loan.<br> Excuse me?<br> If you bring the papers by tomorrow,<br> the Firm will repay it for you.<br> Kay was scared.<br> What? No, she was upset.<br> There is a difference between<br> being upset and being scared.<br> She was scared.<br> Of what?<br> What, do you know her that well?<br> Maybe not.<br> But I've spent<br> a lot of time with her lately.<br> They have their own horses.<br> Two of them. Quarter Horses.<br> Does that make half a horse?<br> Sorry. I...<br> ...and gently wipe away<br> every tear from our eyes.<br> In the name of the Father<br> and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.<br> Amen.<br> Let us pray.<br> Lord our God, you are always faithful<br> and quick to show mercy.<br> Our brother Marty was suddenly<br> and violently taken from us.<br> Come swiftly to his aid.<br> Have mercy on him,<br> and comfort his family and friends<br> by the power<br> and protection of the cross.<br> We ask this through Christ our Lord.<br> Amen.<br> Let us go in the peace of Christ.<br> I'm just gonna go say goodbye to Oliver.<br> - Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> - I'll catch up with you.<br> - All right.<br> Mrs. McDeere, I'm Avery Tolar.<br> You're the reason I see so little<br> of my husband these days.<br> He must be the most ambitious man<br> in the world.<br> One of them.<br> No, I mean leaving you every day<br> just to go off to work.<br> I'm sure you could manage.<br> Just tell me how.<br> Did you know them well?<br> The men who died?<br> Yes.<br> You must be overwhelmed with grief.<br> People grieve in different ways,<br> Mrs. McDeere.<br> Abby!<br> Hey, Hearsay, come here.<br> Shit.<br> - Is he in?<br> - Yes, Mr. Tolar.<br> Hell of a proposal, kiddo.<br> Just redraft this section<br> on repatriation of offshore funds.<br> I need it tomorrow.<br> - Tomorrow?

I'm just a little punchy.<br> That firm looks like a health hazard.<br> - Hours they make you keep.<br> - Kind of work they make you do.<br> Kozinski and Hodges.<br> Bob Lamm and Alice Krauss.<br> That's four dead lawyers out of 41<br> in less than 10 years.<br> And none of them<br> over the age of what, 45?<br> I mean, that beats the hell out of any life<br> insurance tables I've ever heard about.<br> Who are you guys?<br> Could we get those sandwiches<br> to go, please?<br> We'll probably see each other again.<br> The car wouldn't start.<br> I got<br> caught in this incredible accident,<br> 12 cars, maybe 13.<br> There was a pregnant woman<br> in one of them.<br> I had to help deliver the baby.<br> It was a girl.<br> They said<br> they're gonna name her Abigail.<br> Come on, Abby. Why do you think<br> I'm working like this, huh?<br> - 'Cause I want you to have all the stuff...<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I never asked for anything, Mitch,<br> except for us to be together.<br> But I want to give it to you.<br> I want to give you<br> everything you gave up to marry me.<br> Stop it.<br> It's sweet. I know.<br> It's some kind of courtship,<br> but I don't need all that.<br> Just bring me flowers sometime.<br> What were you working on all night?<br> Just, you know, it's...<br> It's just this stuff Avery's got me doing<br> for the Cayman trip.<br> Hey, want to have some eggs?<br> I had some eggs.<br> Want to have some naked?<br> You don't even know<br> what moves me about you, do you?<br> Mitch, I know what you want,<br> but it's not for me.<br> It's not even for you. And you know it.<br> It's easy for somebody rich<br> to talk about being poor<br> like it's some fly that's bothering you<br> and you just wave it away.<br> This isn't about rich or poor.<br> This is about trying to fix something<br> that won't get fixed with 10 Mercedes.<br> Hey, that's not fair, Abby!<br> That's not fair!<br> This is about a mother in a trailer park.<br> And a brother<br> you pretend you don't have.<br> Have a nice trip.<br> Just follow me, and don't over-breathe.<br> What about Sonny Capps?<br> I thought<br> we were under a lot of pressure.<br> We're under tremendous pressure.<br> If we don't get this dive in<br> before the bank, we can't do it.<br> You can't dive<br> and then fly within 24 hours.<br> I don't see how you can dive<br> so soon after the accident.<br> We don't even know what happened<br> to Kozinski and Hodges.<br> Hey, there was a plane crash last week.<br> We didn't take a boat<br> to the Caymans, did we?<br> That's ridiculous, Sonny.<br> Let us sit down with you<br> for five minutes. Thank you.<br> Son of a bitch pays less than 5% tax<br> and wants to fire us. The Hyatt!<br> This new plan<br> is very aggressive, Sonny,<br> and it defers all your tax liability for<br> years. And you could start right away.<br> I'm sorry, sweetheart.<br> I can't talk right now.<br> These taxes are only deferred, right?<br> The future value of the tax dollars will<br> be less than half their present value.<br> - Who says?<br> - After the election...<br> Are you telling me who's gonna be<br> in the White House the next four years,<br> 'cause that would be<br> valuable information.<br> - Well...<br> - Mr. Tolar has a plan that...<br> That meets all your needs,<br> whoever's in the White House.<br> - Let him tell me.<br> - He's been trying to.<br> Hey, who the fuck are you?<br> His lawyer or mine?<br> - Neither one, sir.<br> - What the fuck are you doing here?<br> Sonny, you're not the Firm's<br> only concern here.<br> We put you into deals with other clients<br> where they may be very sensitive<br> about exposing their relationships<br> to outside attorneys.<br> You hear that, Counselor?<br> That's a veiled threat.<br> If you're talking about our friends<br> in Chicago,<br> they don't make money<br> when I pay you fees.<br> You make money when I pay you fees.<br> They make money<br> being in business with me.<br> And as long as they're making money,<br> they don't give a flying fuck<br> who does my taxes.<br> Hey, you don't know me. I'm a nice guy.<br> You lose a million bucks for me,<br> I'm not gonna hurt you.<br> I'm not gonna break your legs.<br> Sonny, let's don't get carried away here,<br> all right?<br> What did I say?<br> Maybe it's what you didn't say.<br> - "What I didn't say." What didn't I say?<br> - Thank you.<br> Mr. Tolar handed you a schedule<br> that virtually guarantees you<br> zero tax with zero risk.<br> The basis of your stock would be<br> the face amount of the installment note,<br> but the stock would have no value.<br> Even so,<br> it's deducted in offsets income.<br> You defer your tax in full<br> even though you have a bankable LC.<br> - Deferred till when?<br> - What do you care?<br> Whenever it is, it's still the best<br> interest free loan you'll ever get.<br> So the worst is,<br> I pay my taxes much, much later.<br> No.<br> The worst thing is next year<br> they're going to close the loophole,<br> change the regs and if<br> you haven't grabbed this proposal,<br> you're gonna feel like you were fucked<br> with a dick big enough<br> for an elephant to feel it.<br> You know that for a fact?<br> Hey, you like the word "protg"?<br> I never had one. You ever been one?<br> I'm A, you're B, right next door.<br> Avery, who's in Chicago?<br> We'll get to all that.<br> The hell with it.<br> Clean up and come on over.<br> You earned a good dinner<br> and a night out.<br> Hey.<br> I lost my son.<br> Don't you think<br> I would have screamed bloody murder<br> if I thought something was wrong?<br> You're right, Mr. Abanks, I'm sorry.<br> Okay? You're right. I'm sorry.<br> Nothing to bury even. Just a stone.<br> They never did find him<br> or the other two.<br> What other two?<br> The other two who split the charter.<br> Your friends and two other guys.<br> - Lawyers?<br> - They were in swim suits.<br> They paid cash.<br> Were they American?<br> Could have been anything.<br> One was, I don't know, squat, heavy.<br> Other guy had long blond hair,<br> almost white, with weird blue eyes.<br> - Mitch?<br> - Yeah.<br> Grab a Red Stripe out of the fridge.<br> I'm a little slow.<br> Take your time.<br> I'm trying to look as pretty as you,<br> which I'm convinced I can.<br> It just takes me a little longer.<br> You got anything to munch on?<br> Yeah, there's a thing full of stuff<br> next to the fridge.<br> It's got a lock on it.<br> Use that key from the ring I gave you.<br> Do you see it?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> You find something?<br> Listen, Capps is a tough guy,<br> but he's also a blowhard.<br> He loves to give the impression<br> that he's connected.<br> Thinks it's glamorous.<br> He said a couple of things.<br> Hey, you're about to take the bar exam.<br> Here's a multiple choice.<br> The difference between<br> tax avoidance and tax evasion is...<br> A, whatever the IRS says.<br> B, a smart lawyer.<br> C, 10 years in prison.<br> D, all of the above.<br> Being a tax lawyer's<br> got nothing to do with the law.<br> It's a game.<br> We teach the rich how to play it,<br> so they can stay rich.<br> The IRS keeps changing the rules<br> so we can keep getting rich<br> teaching them.<br> It's a game.<br> One you just played very, very well.<br> Where's your beer?<br> I decided to wait for the rum.<br> I hear it's good down here.<br> Everything's good down here.<br> You deserve a taste of all of it.<br> I think that<br> since we're here on this island,<br> there's things we can do on it,<br> you know, primitive things.<br> Come on, you deserve it.<br> Look, I don't mean to hurt your feelings,<br> but this isn't gonna happen.<br> Would you tell my friend<br> I went back to the condo?<br> You don't know what you're missing.<br> Thanks anyway.<br> - Leave me alone!<br> - Listen to me.<br> Are you all right?<br> It's okay. Just wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Can I look at this?<br> You're not a doctor.<br> No, but I've<br> sprained a lot of ankles.<br> Mostly mine.<br> You should ice this.<br> You should also report that guy.<br> That was your boyfriend.<br> That was for money.<br> - Aren't you gonna finish?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - You think that's...<br> - Got nothing to do with me.<br> - Is this too tight?<br> - No.<br> I work in a travel agency.<br> I wanted to feel like all those people<br> with first class tickets<br> and pretty clothes.<br> I guess I wanted to feel...<br> Rich.<br> How much would it take to feel rich?<br> I don't know.<br> How much would it take to feel safe?<br> You did that.<br> You made me feel safe.<br> Hey...<br> Will you stay with me for a while?<br> Why don't you take the afternoon off?<br> You deserve it.<br> Spend it with that pretty wife of yours.<br> Oh, shit, I forgot, she phoned last night.<br> What'd you tell her?<br> That you were probably<br> walking on the beach.<br> I was.<br> I guessed right then, didn't I?<br> Okay, Mr. McDeere.<br> If you'll sign where the "X" is<br> and initial where it's marked.<br> Well, well.<br> The man from Gentleman's Quarterly.<br> How you doing, Ray?<br> Pretty fair. How's yourself?<br> It's a long time, huh?<br> It's okay. I've become a patient man.<br> Don't beat yourself up, kid.<br> If I wasn't here,<br> I wouldn't want to be here either.<br> - Do you ever talk to Ma?<br> - A few months ago.<br> - Still with the same guy?<br> - They're all the same guy.<br> So, you finish law school?<br> Yeah.<br> That suit's a dead give-away.<br> What, you get a job on Wall Street?<br> - You always said...<br> - No, I'm not. I just...<br> I went with a firm across the river<br> in Memphis.<br> Memphis?<br> Hey, Ray,<br> wouldn't it be funny<br> if I went to Harvard and you went to jail<br> and we both ended up<br> surrounded by crooks?<br> Sonny Capps is thrilled.<br> McDeere was dazzling.<br> I think we ought to pull Lamar<br> out of that tax seminar in Washington<br> and send Mitch instead.<br> Let him take the jet.<br> Any problem with that, Bill?<br> No. No, no problem.<br> So far the kid's been real predictable.<br> If you're even half right, you're gonna<br> need some help. What does Abby think?<br> I haven't told her.<br> I guess...<br> I guess I don't want it to be real.<br> Nothing's real until I tell it to Abby.<br> How did you ever land a job<br> with a brother in the joint?<br> That's okay.<br> I'd have done the same thing myself.<br> You were always around for me, Ray.<br> All those years after Dad died.<br> I'd have done the same.<br> You think I'd ever tell guys around here<br> I got a brother in Harvard?<br> Jesus, Ray.<br> Hey, listen.<br> I want you to see a friend of mine.<br> His name is Eddie Lomax.<br> He's a private investigator in Little Rock.<br> Ex-cop.<br> Anything I can do for you?<br> Sure. Get me out of here.<br> Where to?<br> Anywhere I can see a whole lot of sky.<br> I can get through the days,<br> I even eat the food.<br> It's amazing<br> how much you miss the sky.<br> Ever plug one of these in<br> only you forgot to put the water in?<br> No.<br> - Do you know what happens?<br> - No.<br> The lights go out.<br> He's been dying to see you<br> since you called.<br> That's what I saw. Tammy!<br> Mr. Lomax will see you now.<br> - Mr. McDeere.<br> - Yes.<br> I practically went to law school with you.<br> Ray talked about you<br> every stinking day for three years.<br> I was his cellmate,<br> he must have told you.<br> Did he tell you,<br> by the way, it was statutory rape?<br> She was 17. Looked 25.<br> I got one to four.<br> Sit down. Sit down. Come on. Sit down,<br> sit down. You want some Sweet'N Low?<br> - You want some dairy cream?<br> - No.<br> You want some sugar?<br> You want some...<br> Eddie, I've got some business<br> - I'd like to go over with you here.<br> - Good. Good. Good.<br> I owe your brother my life.<br> - I'm leaving.<br> - Thank you, dear.<br> That's my secretary. She is terrific.<br> But she's got a nutcase for a husband.<br> He's a truck driver.<br> He moved here<br> to be close to Graceland.<br> The reason why, he thinks he's Elvis.<br> What do you think his name is?<br> It's Elvis. Elvis Aaron Hemphill.<br> I run across some strange things<br> in this job.<br> Some things I'd never spray-paint<br> on an overpass.<br> Now, what can I do for you?<br> - What a nice surprise.<br> - Avery.<br> They didn't have to disturb you.<br> You didn't have to come down.<br> Believe me, it's no bother.<br> I was just looking for Mitch.<br> Nina says<br> he hasn't been in all afternoon.<br> I didn't mean for her to call you.<br> Didn't he come back with you?<br> I'll be honest with you.<br> This is not my area of expertise.<br> - But you think it's possible?<br> - Anything's possible.<br> I'll tell you one thing, if those guys<br> at the steak joint were feds,<br> you better watch out for them.<br> 'Cause they don't give a damn<br> about you.<br> I get some pretty pissed off<br> husbands in here.<br> On the other hand, the lawyers at your<br> firm sure as hell seem accident prone.<br> Okay.<br> I'll see what I can find out.<br> You better let me call you.<br> You sure remind me of your brother.<br> Ray comes up for parole in a while.<br> Says that he can last it.<br> What do you think?<br> There's guys that can do<br> all the hard time the State gives them.<br> Whatever Ray had,<br> he used up to get this far.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - I didn't think you were home.<br> - Why not?<br> - No car.<br> - I took it in for service.<br> Avery brought me home.<br> I went to the office looking for you.<br> I wasn't there.<br> Apparently not.<br> I even looked under your desk.<br> - Yeah, I went...<br> - Avery told me you were at MSU,<br> at the law library.<br> - Avery did.<br> - Avery did.<br> But when I happened to<br> spot your car in the parking lot,<br> it made him kind of edgy.<br> Yeah, well,<br> Avery didn't exactly know where I was.<br> Probably thought<br> you were with another woman.<br> I went to see Ray.<br> Ray?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Just like that, after all this time?<br> You were right. I've been stupid.<br> I would have gone with you on Saturday.<br> I know. God, I just wasn't...<br> I wasn't thinking.<br> How'd it go?<br> It was...<br> God, he...<br> He tried to make it easy for me.<br> Is he okay?<br> He's gotta get that parole.<br> You want to try something?<br> Let's put the books away,<br> pretend we're back<br> in our old beat-up apartment, broke,<br> and we find some money<br> we forgot in pockets.<br> - We'll send out for pizza and drink beer.<br> - Drink beer.<br> And watch Star Search.<br> Who knows where it will lead.<br> Your wife?<br> - She's in Cleveland.<br> - She lies.<br> Don't you answer your phone?<br> Don't you knock?<br> Where's your secretary?<br> Out.<br> - She left a cigarette burning.<br> - She does that.<br> Why don't you come back in one hour,<br> and make an appointment?<br> Why bother? We're here.<br> I'm busy.<br> Doing what?<br> I'm getting a pedicure.<br> What's it to you?<br> Now this is gonna turn out badly for you,<br> but we can make it relatively painless.<br> Why are you asking questions<br> about dead lawyers?<br> What dead lawyers?<br> Who hired you to do that?<br> Okay! Okay.<br> Just let me think.<br> His name was Julio Iglesias.<br> No! No!<br> Great!<br> Just great.<br> You want to ask him<br> a few questions now?<br> I think<br> this is a carefully balanced proposal.<br> I think it's high-minded<br> and I think it's fair-minded.<br> In other words, it's got something in it<br> to offend everyone.<br> If you want to follow along with me,<br> we'll begin on page "l"<br> of the introduction.<br> We'll revue sections 704-B<br> of the IRS code of 1986<br> and the treasury regulations<br> amended under Section 1/704-1.<br> Quote, "The distribution provisions<br> "in limited and<br> general partnership agreements."<br> These regulations permit the IRS to<br> disregard allocations<br> which are not made in accordance<br> with partners' interests<br> in the partnership<br> unless those allocations<br> satisfy the economic effect<br> most easily satisfied<br> by taking advantage of the safe<br> harbor provisions set forth therein.<br> In other words,<br> in an ever-changing sea of tax laws...<br> Hey, brother.<br> Brother, go down the steps<br> towards the pool.<br> Here you go, brother.<br> - Voices from the Wall.<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Mister.<br> Who killed Eddie Lomax?<br> Go over and sit next to<br> the man on the bench.<br> I appreciate your coming, Mr. McDeere.<br> I'll call you Mitch, if I may?<br> My name is Voyles. Denton Voyles.<br> I'm with the Department of Justice.<br> What happened to Eddie Lomax?<br> We've been investigating<br> Bendini, Lambert & Locke for four years.<br> No lawyer has ever<br> left your law firm alive.<br> Two tried to leave, they were killed.<br> Two were about to try,<br> you know what happened.<br> Now, we have reason to believe<br> that your house is bugged.<br> Your phones are tapped,<br> your office is wired.<br> They may follow you, they may be here<br> in Washington as we speak.<br> Are you saying my life is in danger?<br> I'm saying that<br> your life as you know it is over.<br> Your law firm<br> is the sole legal representative<br> of the Morolto crime family in Chicago.<br> Known as the Mafia. The Mob.<br> I don't believe it.<br> They set up legitimate businesses<br> with dirty money from drugs,<br> gambling, prostitution.<br> All cash, all moved offshore.<br> You believe it.<br> That's why you talked<br> to Thomas Abanks in the Caymans.<br> That's why you got<br> this private investigator<br> asking questions that got him killed.<br> Maybe 30% of their clients<br> are legitimate.<br> They bring in a new rookie,<br> throw money at him,<br> buy the car, the house.<br> After a couple of years,<br> and your kids are in private schools,<br> you're used to the good life,<br> they tell you the truth.<br> You mean every partner in the Firm is...<br> Every partner knows.<br> We suspect most of the associates.<br> Why don't you get indictments<br> and bust it all up?<br> We have to have<br> somebody on the inside.<br> We need to see copies of contracts,<br> clients' bank records,<br> - articles of incorporation.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - You think I'm...<br> - You can say no.<br> But we're gonna break this firm.<br> And when that happens, you're gonna<br> go to jail along with the rest.<br> It will happen, son, believe me.<br> Why can't I just leave?<br> That's what Kozinski and Hodges<br> were trying to do.<br> You have to think this over.<br> Meanwhile, you and your wife have to<br> behave as though everything is normal.<br> Now don't discuss this with anyone,<br> but make a decision.<br> If you help us,<br> we'll make it worth your while.<br> Worth my while?<br> You can still have a pretty good life.<br> You mean<br> in a witness protection program?<br> How? I live somebody else's life?<br> In some nowhere place, and one day<br> I'm backing out of my driveway<br> and my car explodes?<br> Doesn't have to be that way.<br> I don't need much of a life, Mr. Voyles,<br> but it has to be mine.<br> Is that what you've got now, son?<br> You ought to get back to the seminar.<br> Tarrance has full authority<br> to negotiate on our behalf.<br> Why don't you wander back<br> past the memorial?<br> You can call me in Memphis anytime,<br> day or night.<br> The second one's a mobile number.<br> Let me get this straight.<br> I steal files from the Firm<br> and turn them over to the FBI.<br> Testify against my colleagues,<br> send them to jail.<br> They suckered you into this.<br> Reveal privileged information that<br> violates attorney-client confidences,<br> get me disbarred, and then testify<br> in open court against the Mafia.<br> - Well, unfortunately, Mitch...<br> - Let me ask you something.<br> Are you out of your fucking mind?<br> How long<br> before they find out Lomax's cellmate<br> was a guy named Ray McDeere?<br> And when they do,<br> what do you think they'll do to him?<br> They can get to anyone, anywhere.<br> What can you do?<br> Your brother comes up for parole soon,<br> doesn't he?<br> You cooperate with us,<br> I'll guarantee the board will be grateful.<br> Otherwise... Well, you know<br> what those parole hearings are like.<br> It could go either way.<br> Forget about home, driver.<br> Take me to the Firm.<br> - The employer will have...<br> - Mr. McDeere, you can't go in there!<br> Call everybody. Right now!<br> - I'm on overseas and I've got two...<br> - Right now!<br> I just had a little chat with the FBI.<br> - And they didn't try to coerce you?<br> - No.<br> - They didn't offer you money?<br> - Nope.<br> Did they ask you to contact them again?<br> What for?<br> Exactly what did they want?<br> The secret files.<br> Who had those secret files last?<br> You have them, Royce?<br> - I gave them to you.<br> - No.<br> They also suggested that Hodges<br> and Kozinski were murdered.<br> Those sons of bitches!<br> Now, we ought to build a case and sue.<br> This is pure harassment.<br> And that was it?<br> That was everything that was said?<br> Well, I mean, as far as I can remember.<br> It wasn't exactly<br> a sequential conversation.<br> There was a lot of yelling, mostly by me.<br> Mitch, we're always doing battle<br> with the government.<br> If it isn't the Justice Department,<br> it's the IRS, and you know what?<br> We beat them every time.<br> And they hate us for it.<br> They can't get to us<br> so they pick on somebody new.<br> They invite you to break the law.<br> Doesn't cost them anything,<br> but it costs you everything.<br> Now, I don't want you<br> to worry about this.<br> It's gotten serious enough.<br> We'll have to get into it legally.<br> I guess the only other question is,<br> who do we bill this hour to?<br> How about the FBI?<br> I can't believe that. That is so weird.<br> I was just thinking about you.<br> Somebody's burning leaves outside,<br> did you smell it?<br> It reminded me of the time...<br> Hey!<br> If you're afraid you'll wake the kids,<br> we don't have any.<br> Abby!<br> - Abby!<br> - Don't say anything! Don't say anything!<br> Don't tell me any more!<br> Everything.<br> Every single thing we've said<br> or done since we've been in that house,<br> nothing has been between us.<br> Can't we just get in our own car<br> and drive back to Boston, tonight?<br> - We'll just leave everything.<br> - They'd find us.<br> How do you go to work tomorrow?<br> How do you look at Avery?<br> What do you say to him?<br> I talk about work.<br> - That's insane!<br> - I have thought of every possible way.<br> Here, in the Caymans, in Washington,<br> that's all I've done.<br> Try to think of a way out. If we run,<br> they'd find us, and it gets Ray killed.<br> - But if you testify...<br> - The FBI says they'll help Ray<br> - and protect us.<br> - Protect what?<br> What are you going to do?<br> Go in tomorrow and start to copy files.<br> I don't have a choice.<br> Mitch,<br> what are you saying?<br> You'll be revealing clients' secrets.<br> - You'll be disbarred.<br> - Abby, don't...<br> You'll never be able to practice<br> law again for the rest of your life.<br> Everything you've worked for!<br> They can't ask you to do that!<br> They are not asking!<br> We have to behave<br> exactly as we have been.<br> We have to go to work<br> and come home every day<br> and never wonder about the walls<br> and the wires...<br> And do nothing we want to do.<br> Szechwan beef from Wong Boys.<br> That was the last time<br> I remember laughing.<br> - Come on! Every single day we got...<br> - Oh, not you again, man.<br> ...one of your trucks out here,<br> blocking this alley.<br> - Hey, leave me alone.<br> - What's it gonna take, huh?<br> Hey, would you leave me alone, buddy?<br> You're using this place as a parking lot!<br> What the hell are you doing?<br> Jesus, I was just trying<br> to make a copy of...<br> They just started this. You have to have<br> the billing code for each client.<br> You mean every time<br> I copy a piece of paper, it's recorded?<br> What are you trying to do, kill yourself?<br> Come on. Nina should do that anyway.<br> Come down for one night, can't you?<br> Well, it used to be worth it.<br> Okay. Yeah, maybe next time.<br> Bye, Cordelia.<br> That was Cordelia.<br> Yeah. Your wife.<br> From the song of the same name.<br> Avery, I have a couple of ideas<br> about those Capps LCs.<br> When's the next Cayman trip?<br> For me? Next week.<br> If you think I'm gonna let Sonny Capps<br> get another look at you, you're crazy.<br> But you write down<br> every single thought you have.<br> I'll be happy to take credit.<br> Mr. McDeere! Mr. Mulholland's<br> called twice about his bills again.<br> Tell Mr. Mulholland to take his bill and...<br> No, wait a minute, wait a minute.<br> Isn't he just up the street?<br> - Yes. In the Cotton Exchange.<br> - Cotton Exchange.<br> Tell him I'll see him later.<br> Did you order a fried egg sandwich<br> from the Front Street Deli?<br> A fried egg...<br> Yes, I did. I did.<br> Come in.<br> It's $2.65. The receipt's in the bag.<br> The receipt's in the bag.<br> How did you see them,<br> and they didn't see you?<br> I was under the desk.<br> I was vacuuming the rug.<br> You want me to draw you a diagram?<br> I loved him.<br> I'm sorry, Tammy.<br> They wanted to know who hired him<br> and why he was asking questions<br> about dead lawyers.<br> You actually saw them?<br> One guy was stocky,<br> looked like a wrestler.<br> He's gonna limp the rest of his life<br> 'cause Eddie hit him in the knee<br> with that cannon under his desk.<br> And the other guy was like an albino.<br> Long thin hair, almost white.<br> Dead blue eyes.<br> My landlady said<br> they came looking for me yesterday,<br> so I checked into the Motel 6<br> on River Street.<br> I couldn't think of anywhere else to go.<br> Listen, they're gonna put Eddie<br> together with Ray, and when they do,<br> it'll lead to you.<br> I don't want anything bad<br> to happen to you.<br> Eddie wouldn't like it.<br> So, you're in as much trouble as I am.<br> Listen, there's a building around<br> the corner called the Cotton Exchange.<br> Maybe you can help, Tammy.<br> Hi there, Mitch.<br> Bill Devasher, Firm Security.<br> Mr. Locke and Mr. Lambert were telling<br> me about your little run in with the FBI.<br> I wonder if we could have a little talk.<br> Actually, I told them everything.<br> I'm sure you did.<br> This won't take a minute.<br> Hop in.<br> So, Mitch, this is a debriefing.<br> I know pretty much<br> what you told the fellows,<br> so I kind of got the picture.<br> Now it's my job to give you the picture.<br> What I'm concerned about, son, is this.<br> The FBI wouldn't have come after you<br> if they didn't figure they'd get to you.<br> What do you suppose<br> made them think that?<br> I have no idea.<br> Well, see, it's my job<br> to have an idea about that.<br> For example, they might know<br> how important your young wife is to you.<br> They might use that.<br> How?<br> Avery says last Friday<br> you took the afternoon off.<br> He figures you might have been<br> with another woman.<br> - Why would Avery think...<br> - How do you know<br> you weren't followed?<br> Picture Abby one day<br> walking to the mail box,<br> anticipating the arrival of her Redbook,<br> her Sharper lmage catalog.<br> What does she find instead?<br> She finds heartache, Mitch.<br> The death of love and trust.<br> Imagine her one day opening that.<br> Go ahead. Take a look.<br> Devastating.<br> Not just screwing, Mitch.<br> But the kind of intimate acts,<br> oral and whatnot,<br> that can be particularly hard<br> for a trusting young wife to forgive<br> and impossible to forget.<br> That's just the kind of stuff<br> the FBI could use for coercion, Mitch.<br> So you watch yourself.<br> I'll do the best I can to protect you,<br> and I know you will do your best<br> to protect the Firm.<br> So if the FBI so much<br> as spits in your direction,<br> you'll let me know<br> before it hits the ground, won't you?<br> Won't you, Mitch?<br> Oliver wants to see you right now<br> in the library. Where you been?<br> Let me just put my coat away.<br> Right now. He's been waiting.<br> You think you're pretty smart, don't you?<br> Well, we've been informed<br> there's somebody smarter.<br> You didn't get the highest score<br> on the bar exam,<br> you got the second-highest score.<br> Cheers!<br> Nice one.<br> Congratulations.<br> They called you, huh?<br> Guilty, Your Honor.<br> I did it.<br> Well, it's your moment of glory.<br> You know, my wife missed mine,<br> and she never forgave herself.<br> I wouldn't want that to happen to you.<br> - That's very considerate, Avery.<br> - Well, I thought so.<br> Well done. Well done.<br> - Quite an achievement, Mitch.<br> - Abby.<br> Well, the space is just great. I'll take it.<br> - And the lease would be under...<br> - Greenwood Secretarial Services.<br> And you are...<br> - Doris Greenwood. I like that suit a lot.<br> - Well, thank you.<br> They're gonna deliver<br> a copier tomorrow.<br> - I'll make sure the office is open.<br> - All right.<br> I will employ such means only<br> as are consistent with truth and honor.<br> I will maintain the confidence<br> and preserve inviolate<br> the secrets of my client.<br> I will maintain the confidence<br> and preserve inviolate<br> the secrets of my client.<br> I will truly and honestly conduct myself<br> in the practice of my profession<br> to the best of my skill and ability,<br> so help me God.<br> "I will maintain the confidence<br> and preserve inviolate<br> "the secrets of my client"?<br> The first thing I'm gonna do<br> is violate the secrets of my clients.<br> Do you see any other way?<br> Okay, then.<br> Aren't we doing the best we can?<br> No.<br> What do you mean?<br> I can't.<br> What?<br> That...<br> That night...<br> That night in the Caymans<br> when you telephoned...<br> You were on the beach.<br> What?<br> What did you do?<br> No.<br> You didn't...<br> Who was she?<br> - I don't know.<br> - You don't know?<br> I don't even know her name.<br> It didn't mean anything.<br> Like hell it didn't. It means everything.<br> What did you do?<br> Why did you fuck some stranger<br> on a beach one night away from me?<br> Who does that?<br> - Abby, I promise you...<br> - What?<br> You can't promise anything. Not ever.<br> Not anymore.<br> Why did you tell me?<br> Because I couldn't stand not to.<br> I couldn't stand your not knowing.<br> Well, now I know.<br> Give me the keys.<br> Sorry, I...<br> Just give me the keys.<br> I thought<br> there were only two Brothers Grimm.<br> Sit down, Avery.<br> Anthony and Joey<br> are coming down next week.<br> - What for?<br> - Works out your protg's got a brother.<br> So?<br> He didn't mention him<br> at the interview in Boston.<br> I've got a brother<br> I might not mention either<br> - in polite conversation.<br> - This brother's doing time.<br> How did you find that out?<br> What do you think I am here,<br> a fucking night watchman?<br> I get confused sometimes.<br> - Well, don't!<br> - All right, Avery.<br> We got a prison guard in Arkansas.<br> He's on the arm.<br> He tells us about a Ray McDeere<br> doing time for manslaughter.<br> The Moroltos have been edgy ever<br> since the Kozinski and Hodges mess.<br> They're concerned that<br> we might be misreading McDeere.<br> And the Moroltos are coming for what?<br> - To personally take over?<br> - Are we misreading him?<br> I don't think so.<br> Wouldn't you lie if you had a felon<br> in the family to get a job like this?<br> I still think we ought to<br> keep him on a pretty tight leash.<br> Why? You've got nothing to be<br> suspicious about.<br> I get paid to be suspicious when<br> I got nothing to be suspicious about.<br> Excuse me.<br> You're not listening, Mr. McDeere.<br> I'm sorry. You were talking about hours?<br> Listen, I know I'm not Bendini-Lambert's<br> most valuable client,<br> but I've got a legitimate complaint here.<br> You never spent 33 hours last month<br> on my account.<br> Is that what you were billed?<br> You don't see your own bills?<br> No, I just submit my time sheet.<br> Where is it?<br> It's on file with the office manager.<br> You know,<br> this overbilling's gotten so common<br> nobody gives it another thought.<br> It's kind of like tipping.<br> Well, it's not policy, Mr. Mulholland.<br> It sure seems like policy.<br> It's been going on over there for years.<br> People forget something else, too.<br> When somebody over there<br> put a stamp on this and mailed it,<br> you know what happened?<br> - It became a federal offense.<br> - It became a federal offense.<br> You're damn right.<br> Each instance punishable by...<br> $10,000 fine.<br> Three to five years each instance.<br> Nina, I'm going over to Mulholland's<br> for a half hour or so.<br> All righty.<br> - Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br> - I got the beeper.<br> I think there might be<br> a way of doing this<br> without getting disbarred<br> and without breaking the law.<br> Is that our chief concern here?<br> Tear those up.<br> I might not have to use them.<br> But I got to get to<br> that stuff in the Caymans.<br> What, for the FBI?<br> No. For me.<br> They won't let you go, you said.<br> Somebody's gonna have to get to it<br> another way.<br> It has to happen fast.<br> I got to figure out what to do about Ray.<br> What?<br> In Eddie's stuff, is there some<br> kind of wireless recording device?<br> Yes. Yes!<br> You know how to use it?<br> Whenever Eddie said, "My associate"?<br> Yours truly.<br> Did he have any<br> high-speed camera equipment?<br> - Sure.<br> - I want you to get hold of a van, Tammy.<br> Hey, Tammy,<br> did Elvis ever find out about Eddie?<br> Oh, man. He loved Eddie.<br> Are you kidding?<br> Hell, that stuff was over<br> between me and Elvis when I was 18.<br> We'd been married two years,<br> and one morning at breakfast<br> I just turned too old for him.<br> But I tell you, everybody loves Elvis.<br> The man's a panda.<br> And he'd do anything for me.<br> They're off, and Say Something<br> comes away on top<br> and Right There<br> is stepping over on the inside.<br> Champagne Now rushes up...<br> Doesn't a dog ever get the bone?<br> Yeah, I hear it happens once in a while.<br> It's a disaster.<br> They can never get that dog<br> to run again.<br> Listen, Mitch,<br> Mr. Voyles wants me to tell you<br> how much the Bureau appreciates...<br> A million dollars<br> in a numbered account in Switzerland.<br> IBG Bank International in Zurich.<br> Well, you sure as hell<br> turned greedy overnight.<br> And my brother out. Now.<br> Your brother is a convicted felon, Mitch.<br> Then get yourself another snitch.<br> He's in for manslaughter.<br> It was a brawl in a bar.<br> If he hadn't done any boxing,<br> it would have been self-defense.<br> It's still a felony, Mitch.<br> You heard me, Tarrance.<br> My brother out now.<br> And make it a million and a half.<br> How about you get down on your knees<br> and kiss my ass<br> for not indicting you<br> as a co-conspirator right now,<br> you chickenshit<br> little Harvard cocksucker!<br> I haven't done anything,<br> and you know it!<br> Who gives a fuck? I'm a federal agent.<br> You know what that means,<br> you low life motherfucker?<br> You got no rights. Your life is mine.<br> I could kick your teeth down your throat,<br> yank them out your asshole<br> and I'm not even<br> violating your civil rights.<br> - You are Agent Wayne Tarrance.<br> - Yeah, you're goddamn right I am!<br> Maybe local cops can't...<br> - Yeah.<br> - Is this Wayne Tarrance?<br> - Who is this?<br> - Is this Wayne Tarrance?<br> Yeah, this is Wayne Tarrance.<br> So is this.<br> ...cocksucker!<br> I haven't done anything,<br> and you know it!<br> Who gives a fuck?

Your life is mine.<br> I could kick your teeth down your throat,<br> yank them out your asshole<br> and I'm not even<br> violating your civil rights.<br> Now, I think you ought to reconsider.<br> I think I might have found a way out.<br> Not out, exactly.<br> It's more like a way through.<br> It's a long shot, but it's... Well, it's legal.<br> I know it's weird, but if we follow<br> the law, it just might save us.<br> You don't want to hear the plan.<br> Would it change anything between us?<br> It's just a plan.<br> I can't do this anymore.<br> I can't help you here. I can't help myself.<br> I've given notice at the school.<br> I'll leave after the break Wednesday.<br> You're right. It's better if you go, safer.<br> - You have no idea...<br> - Don't!<br> - I love you, Abby.<br> - Don't you dare, you son of a bitch!<br> You want to tell me your plan?<br> Tomorrow.<br> Abby, where are you gonna go?<br> To my parents, first.<br> After that, I don't know.<br> It might not be safe for you to leave,<br> unless they know why...<br> I know.

I want him brought in.<br> Use the Memphis police if you have to,<br> but get him.<br> It's a red KW 10-ton registered<br> to a Farley's Catfish Farm.<br> Get its routes and find that truck.<br> And issue APBs<br> on Ray and Mitchell McDeere.<br> During the great steamboat era,<br> which was at its height in the 1870s,<br> these great floating palaces,<br> like the Robert E. Lee,<br> whose model you see here,<br> numbered by the hundreds<br> on the Mississippi River.<br> The Robert E. Lee<br> was actually designed specifically<br> to travel on the Mississippi River,<br> which is a shallow river...<br> Follow me now to the main deck of the<br> boat where the cargo would be carried<br> as well as the deck passengers.<br> The great rollers<br> that powered the steam engine<br> were situated here<br> on the main deck of the boat.<br> Hey, Mitch. Mitch!<br> The end of the great steam era<br> and the advent of the railway.<br> The next gallery detailing...<br> We have here the working steam engine<br> off the US Army Corps of Engineers<br> snag boat, the Arkansas II.<br> Now a steam engine works<br> by lighting a fire underneath the boilers<br> where the water is contained.<br> This heats the water<br> and turns it into steam.<br> Because the kids wanted me<br> to bring them by.<br> Why, what's the matter?<br> Okay. Oh, Lamar, I just saw Mitch<br> at Mud Island Museum.<br> He was zipping through like a tourist.<br> I waved to him but he didn't see me.<br> Northwest Airlines Flight 264<br> arriving from Chicago,<br> Gate B-1, main concourse.<br> - Devasher.<br> - Sir,<br> they spotted McDeere on Mud Island.<br> Get the boys over there, right away!<br> I'm on my way.<br> Okay. Let's get these below<br> with the rest of them.<br> - Abanks' Diving Lodge.<br> - How are my friends?<br> Okay.<br> Your brother's on the plane and<br> Tammy's loading the ship now.<br> It worked out.<br> Your lawyer friend is dead.<br> He never was on the boat.<br> He canceled the charter.<br> - Well, how did...<br> - He drowned.<br> In his bathtub. After the lady left.<br> Didn't Tammy tell you?<br> What lady?<br> - How did you get...<br> - I don't know.<br> A lady friend of Tammy's slipped him<br> some kind of Mickey Finn.<br> I think it was somebody he knew.<br> What are you talking about?<br> What lady friend?<br> Wait a minute.<br> Mitch is asking about your friend Abby.<br> Isn't that her name?<br> Hey!<br> Excuse me.<br> Come here.<br> He's in that first door.<br> I'm going around the front.<br> You sick son of a bitch!<br> Well, of course I can talk.<br> Why, isn't that what I'm doing?<br> I mean, if it's something else,<br> please advise me, Maury.<br> I always like to learn something<br> I don't know at $500 an hour.<br> I swear to you, Joey, every fucking<br> lawyer on the face of the earth<br> ought to be killed.<br> You want to what?<br> You want to meet with McDeere?<br> For what? So the two of you can get<br> together and charge me $1,000 an hour<br> while they send me to Joliet<br> for 30 years?<br> Stay in Chicago, Maury.<br> This kid's cut a deal<br> and I bet it's a beaut.<br> If I get my hands on this fucking kid,<br> Joey, if I get my hands on this kid...<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Not now, Ruthie.<br> I think it's urgent, Mr. Morolto.<br> Ruthie thinks it's urgent.<br> What do you think, Joey?<br> It's a Mr. McDeere.<br> Mr. Mitchell McDeere.<br> He's waiting to see you.<br> I think Ruth is right.<br> I'm Mitch McDeere.<br> I'm your attorney.<br> One of them, anyway.<br> I assume you knew,<br> but I thought I'd mention it, in case.<br> - Would you care to sit down?<br> - Not really.<br> I want to try and...<br> This is just... This is very awkward.<br> I'm afraid my firm has behaved<br> in an unethical manner.<br> It seems that we,<br> Bendini, Lambert & Locke,<br> the entire firm, has been engaged in a...<br> Well, a conspiracy.<br> We've been<br> overbilling our clients.<br> In some cases, massive overbilling.<br> I assure you I had no idea any of this<br> was going on when I joined the Firm.<br> Well, I feel I have to report<br> this criminal behavior.<br> But I can't use...<br> I can't use your invoices<br> without your written authorization.<br> - Our invoices?<br> - Tony, please.<br> Listen.<br> Yes, sir. Your bills.<br> You see, it's an important part<br> of the proof that we've overbilled you.<br> That's it?<br> Pretty much.<br> Well, most of our clients<br> have already agreed, pretty much all.<br> Except for you. Which is why I'm here.<br> And this is what<br> you've been talking to the FBI about?<br> You want us to let you turn our bills...<br> What we charged you,<br> I should say overcharged you.<br> ...over to the government.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Now, does that in any way...<br> - No, sir.<br> It does not in any way waive your rights<br> to full and complete confidentiality<br> in any other area<br> of the attorney-client relationship.<br> I'm your lawyer, gentlemen.<br> Whether I like it or not, I can't talk<br> to the government about you<br> even when I'm no longer your lawyer.<br> That would be breaking my word,<br> my oath.<br> All right, Mitch.<br> So what was this stealing of the files?<br> What the fuck was this all about?<br> The files haven't been stolen.<br> They're in exactly the same place<br> they were.<br> I just felt it was important for me<br> to be thoroughly familiar<br> with the precise make-up<br> and whereabouts<br> of all your holdings and activities.<br> So I prepared copies of everything.<br> That way you and I<br> can communicate perfectly,<br> and, of course,<br> if we ever have to talk to a third party,<br> then I know everything,<br> right down to the penny, pound,<br> franc and deutsche mark.<br> I know everything you know.<br> As I should, as your attorney.<br> And what if the Firm<br> should desire at some point<br> to terminate your employment?<br> Whatever I know, wherever I go, I am<br> bound by the attorney-client privilege.<br> I am very much like...<br> I would say I am exactly like<br> a ship carrying a cargo<br> that will never reach any port.<br> And as long as I am alive, that ship<br> will always be at sea, so to speak.<br> Like Yasir-fucking-Arafat, huh?<br> Never a night in the same place.<br> In any case,<br> I need your written authorization,<br> so I can release your bills,<br> like every other client has given.<br> You have this authorization with you?<br> I do.<br> - Anything in there?<br> - Nothing.<br> Fuck!<br> You got the account number?<br> You know how to access it?<br> Mitch has verified<br> that the money's there.<br> $750,000.<br> I love your crooked little mouth.<br> Well, it's not my best feature.<br> Wow!<br> Well, what is?<br> Where the hell are you?<br> What is this supposed to be? Huh?<br> - You let the Moroltos off the hook?<br> - They're my clients.<br> They're the crooks.<br> You're letting the Mafia get away.<br> - What the hell are you doing?<br> - You guys are always one villain<br> behind the times, you know that?<br> You gave me a bunch of pencil pushers<br> who padded their bills.<br> You think if they don't pull guns,<br> they aren't the bad guys.<br> Ask the Moroltos who's harder to find,<br> the killer or the lawyer<br> who hides their money.<br> Don't give me that shit!<br> That's a bunch of double talk<br> and you know it.<br> You want the Mafia? Get their lawyers.<br> Without the Firm, the only way<br> the Moroltos can launder money<br> is in a washing machine.<br> You are so naive.<br> There'll be a thousand other<br> Bendini-Lamberts<br> fighting for the chance<br> to launder money tomorrow.<br> How the hell you gonna get all of them?<br> One at a time.<br> I'm a lawyer and I got mine.<br> You're the cop, Tarrance,<br> you get the rest of them.<br> Get them with what?<br> Overbilling? Mail fraud? That's exciting.<br> It's not sexy, but it's got teeth,<br> $10,000 and five years in prison.<br> That's 10 and five for each act.<br> Have you really looked at that?<br> You've got every partner in the Firm<br> on overbilling.<br> There's 250 acts<br> of documented mail fraud there.<br> That's racketeering.<br> That's a minimum<br> of 1,250 years in prison<br> and two and a half million dollars<br> in fines.<br> That's more than you had on Capone.<br> You twist this into whatever you want.<br> You made a deal to save your ass.<br> You got our money,<br> three quarters of a million dollars of it,<br> you're still a hot-shot lawyer<br> and you're out of this.<br> I didn't keep a nickel of your money.<br> It was always for somebody else.<br> And, yeah,<br> I'm still a lawyer with references<br> from Bendini, Lambert & Locke.<br> You want to put that on your resume?<br> You think I'm ever gonna<br> turn on the ignition in my car again<br> without sweating?<br> Then I don't understand you.<br> What did you do it for?<br> You didn't win a thing.<br> Oh, yeah, I did. I won my life back.<br> You don't run me and they don't run me.<br> You want to know something weird?<br> I discovered the law again.<br> You actually made me think about it.<br> I managed to get through three years<br> of law school without doing that.<br> It's you at the dog track.<br> I could've gone public with it.<br> - Why didn't you?<br> - It's against the law.<br> Okay.<br> How in the hell<br> did you ever come up with mail fraud?<br> It was on the bar exam.<br> They made me study like hell for it.<br> Well, you've had a busy day.<br> So did you.<br> Why didn't you tell me the truth<br> about your plan?<br> All of it? The Moroltos.<br> Because I knew you'd worry,<br> and that might make you stay.<br> And I knew you needed to leave.<br> I like what you've done to the place.<br> - I thought you were going to your folks'.<br> - I was.<br> Some detour.<br> Where are you going?<br> To look for you.<br> I guess I didn't feel I could leave you<br> without trying to help you.<br> Do you want to tell me what happened?<br> Someday.<br> I think you should know<br> that Avery was pretty decent.<br> He was decent, and corrupt,<br> and ruined, and so unhappy...<br> Listen, Abby...<br> And it could have happened to you,<br> all of it.<br> You were on your way.<br> Did I lose you?<br> You look tired.<br> Did I?<br> I've loved you all my life.<br> Even before we met.<br> Part of it wasn't even you,<br> it was just a promise of you.<br> But these last days,<br> you kept your promise.<br> How could you lose me?<br> - You think it will make it?<br> - Make it where?<br> Boston.<br> What's in Boston?<br> We are.<br> And the Wong Boys, and my kids.<br> And a very small unknown law firm.<br> With a lot of potential.<br> Yeah. 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br> 10<br> 11<br> 12<br>
