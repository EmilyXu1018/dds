                        Hey, it's Monday morning,<br> and I'm Jack Lucas.<br> Hi. This is about my husband.<br> Yes.<br> He drives me crazy.<br> I'll be talking...<br> and he'll never let me<br> finish a sentence.<br> - He's always finishing--<br> - He's always finishing your thoughts.<br> That's awful.<br> It absolutely drives me--<br> It drives you crazy, doesn't it?<br> He's a scoundrel.<br> Jack, you've hit the nail--<br> Hit the nail on the head.<br> Somebody ought to hit you on the head.<br> So tell us. How long have you<br> and Senator Payton been having...<br> this sleazy affair?<br> This is great.<br> This is disgusting.<br> I am tired<br> of the public thinking...<br> that they have a right to invade<br> a person's private life.<br> Come on. You had sex with a senator<br> in the parking lot of Sea World.<br> You're telling me you're<br> a private kind of person? No.<br> - You're our--<br> - Spotlight Celebrity!<br> We want to hear about<br> the backrests of limos.<br> About the ruined lives of people<br> we want to be.<br> New and exotic uses<br> for champagne corks.<br> I have been humiliated enough already,<br> okay?<br> Perhaps not.<br> We need those details.<br> You're a pig, Jack.<br> You're on the air, caller.<br> Hello, Jack. It's Edwin.<br> Oh, it's Edwin!<br> We haven't heard from you in what?<br> A day? I've missed you.<br> I've missed you, too.<br> It's sunrise confession time.<br> What have you got for us?<br> I went to this bar...<br> this very hard-to-get-into place<br> called Babbitt's.<br> I know the place. It's a chic<br> yuppie watering hole.<br> I met this beautiful woman.<br> Come on. If you start telling me<br> you're falling in love again...<br> I'll have to remind you of the time<br> we made you propose...<br> to that check-out girl at Thritty's<br> that you liked so much.<br> Do you remember her reaction?<br> She was just a girl.<br> This is a beautiful woman.<br> And "Pinocchio" is a true story.<br> You'll never get this tart<br> to your dessert plate.<br> This is different.<br> She likes--<br> Edwin ! Come on, now.<br> I told you about these people.<br> They only mate with their own kind.<br> It's called yuppie inbreeding.<br> That's why so many are retarded and wear<br> the same clothes. They're not human.<br> They don't feel love.<br> They only negotiate love moments.<br> They're evil.<br> They're repulsed by imperfection,<br> horrified by the banal.<br> Everything that America stands for,<br> everything that you and I tight for.<br> They must be stopped<br> before it's too late.<br> It's us or them.<br> Okay, Jack.<br> All right.<br> Well, it's been a thrill, as always.<br> Have a perfect day. Everyone here<br> at the "Jack Lucas Show"...<br> says "Bye."<br> This is Jack Lucas.<br> So long. Arrivederci.<br> I'll be sending you a thought today...<br> as I lie in the back<br> of my stretch limo...<br> having sex with the teenager<br> of my choice.<br> And that thought will be...<br> "Thank God I'm me."<br> Some of this is very funny.<br> They even secured the rights to the<br> Donna Summer song to play over credits.<br> Ooh, I have chills.<br> You sure they want me? I won't read it<br> unless I have an offer.<br> Of course. Not even a question.<br> When I talked to them on the phone,<br> I could smell how much they want you.<br> I could smell it over the phone.<br> Bums.<br> I don't have any change.<br> You have any?<br> I'm not opening this window.<br> A couple quarters isn't gonna make<br> any difference anyway.<br> I hate my cheeks.<br> Raoul called before about dinner.<br> Oh, God.<br> About dinner as a concept,<br> or about dinner with Raoul?<br> You're so witty.<br> I've got to get out of here<br> and do something.<br> Tomorrow is a very big day for me.<br> It would be nice it you pretended<br> like you understood.<br> Fine. I'll say no.<br> - They're putting me on film tomorrow.<br> - Fine.<br> First time in my life<br> I'll be a voice with a body.<br> You know what that means?<br> What this could lead to?<br> It's a sitcom, Jack.<br> You're not defining pi.<br> I'll remember that when you get excited<br> drawing pubic hair on Raisin Bran.<br> Do you want some?<br> No. I have to work.<br> How un-'60s of you.<br> I was nine in the '60s.<br> I used to think...<br> my biography<br> ought to be entitled...<br> "Jack Lucas:<br> The Face Behind the Voice."<br> But now it can be,<br> "Jack Lucas: The Face and the Voice."<br> Or maybe just "Jack!"<br> Exclamation point.<br> "Honey, where's my orange cup<br> with the teddy bear?<br> I'll kill that old bitch.<br> I have a fever.<br> I really think I'm dying.<br> Well, forgive me."<br> Forgive me.<br> I have this.<br> I really have this.<br> They're evil. They're repulsed by<br> imperfection, horrified by the banal.<br> Everything that America stands for,<br> everything that you and I fight for.<br> They must be stopped before<br> it's too late. It's us or them.<br> It was Mr. Lucas's offhand remark<br> that had fatal impact on Mr. Malnick.<br> Marc Saffron is on the scene.<br> An after-work hot spot...<br> Babbitt's is popular<br> with single, young professionals.<br> Edwin Malnick arrived<br> at the peak hour of 7:15...<br> took one long look at the collection<br> of the city's best and brightest...<br> then removed a shotgun<br> from his overcoat and opened fire.<br> Seven people were killed before<br> Mr. Malnick turned the gun on himself...<br> and shot a hole through his head.<br> Representatives of radio personality<br> Jack Lucas expressed regret...<br> however no formal comment<br> has been made.<br> Neighbors of Malnick said he was<br> a quiet man who lived alone.<br> "You scarcely knew he was there," said<br> a woman who lived near Malnick 11 years.<br> But today, few will soon forget<br> this lonely man...<br> who reached out to a world<br> he knew only through the radio...<br> looking for friendship,<br> and finding only pain and tragedy.<br> Marc Saffron, Channel Seven News.<br> Fuck.<br> Garbage. People are garbage.<br> Pigs!<br> Go ahead and panic.<br> Mr. Happiness.<br> You gonna do a little work today<br> or what?<br> What, out there?<br> They're not terrorists.<br> They're just ordinary people<br> like you and me.<br> Breakfast of champions, right?<br> That one.<br> That will be for me,<br> and then this scary one.<br> Yes. A scary one and a funny one.<br> Can you help me?<br> I've been looking over an hour,<br> and I'm losing my mind.<br> What I'm in the mood for is<br> a Katherine-Hepburny, Cary-Granty thing.<br> Nothing heavy. I couldn't take heavy.<br> I'm looking for something zany.<br> Or something modern would be fine,<br> like a Goldie-Hawny, Chevy-Chasey thing.<br> You know, funny.<br> I have to laugh tonight.<br> Do you have anything with<br> that comedian? He's on that show.<br> It's "On the Radio." You know,<br> the guy who says, "Hey, forgive me."<br> I get such a kick out of the way<br> he says that.<br> He's so adorable.<br> That would be perfect.<br> Didn't he make a movie?<br> "Ordinary Peepholes."<br> It's kind of a big-titty,<br> spread-cheeky kind of thing.<br> Excuse me. I just want<br> to borrow him for a minute.<br> You're gonna love that.<br> - That was a frightening woman.<br> - Are you in one of your moods today?<br> If she didn't get something zany quick,<br> she was going to pull the pin.<br> Is this one of the days<br> when you're in your emotional abyss?<br> I don't understand these moods<br> that you get into.<br> They're my moods.<br> You want to understand moods, have one<br> of your own. I hate desperate people.<br> Sweetie, baby, love of my life,<br> you hate people.<br> Why don't you take the day off?<br> Go upstairs, put your feet up.<br> I'll cook tonight. Okay?<br> All right.<br> Have you seen my orange cup<br> with the teddy bear?<br> Grandma used it<br> for her urine specimen.<br> - It's funny. What do you want from me?<br> - It's not funny.<br> -Why do we watch it all the time?<br> -I feel good to see how not funny it is.<br> How America doesn't know funny, which<br> makes it easier not being famous...<br> because that would mean<br> I'm not really talented.<br> You are a sick fuck.<br> You know that?<br> I don't know why you torture yourself.<br> - Don't do that. I don't like that.<br> - I'm trying to watch.<br> You have too many thoughts<br> roaming around.<br> You're very self-absorbed.<br> Divert yourself.<br> Read a book.<br> It's important to think, Anne.<br> It's what separates us from lentils...<br> and people that read books<br> like "Love Song."<br> Great book, dumb title.<br> You know, you used to say<br> you liked that about me.<br> You used to say you liked that we<br> didn't have to think all the time...<br> that we could just be together<br> and not think.<br> Well...<br> suicidal paranoiacs<br> will say anything to get laid.<br> Have another drink, Jack.<br> It's on the house, like everything else.<br> I hope when you're my age, your children<br> treat you with the same disrespect.<br> I've got a fever. I'm dying.<br> You're not dying.<br> You just have a cold.<br> You can't die before Sunday because<br> we're going to the Billy Joel concert.<br> Well, forgive me!<br> Madness!<br> Shit!<br> Forgive me!<br> Fuck.<br> Watch it, asshole.<br> Forgive me, tuck-head!<br> Hey, over here!<br> Here I am.<br> Taxi !<br> Hello! Merry Christmas!<br> Hey, buddy, help a guy out.<br> Help me out with a quarter.<br> Come on. Sport.<br> Get away from me.<br> You're a maniac.<br> You're crazy.<br> Mr. Bum?<br> Here.<br> Anybody here named Jiminy?<br> You ever read Nietzsche?<br> Nietzsche says there are<br> two kinds of people in the world.<br> People who are destined<br> for greatness...<br> like Walt Disney and Hitler...<br> and then there's the rest of us.<br> He called us...<br> "the bungled and the botched."<br> We get teased.<br> We sometimes get close to greatness...<br> but we never get there.<br> We're the expendable masses.<br> We get pushed in front of trains,<br> take poison aspirin...<br> get gunned down in Dairy Queens.<br> You want to hear the new title<br> of my biography...<br> my little Italian friend?<br> "It Was No Fuckin' Picnic:<br> The Jack Lucas Story."<br> You like it?<br> Il Nova Esta<br> Fuckin' Picnic-O.<br> You're a good kid.<br> You just say "No" to drugs.<br> You ever get the feeling sometimes...<br> you're being punished for your sins?<br> What's goin' on?<br> I said, what's goin' on?<br> What are you doin' here, man?<br> You shouldn't hang around<br> this neighborhood.<br> I was just leaving.<br> People spend hard-earned money<br> for this neighborhood.<br> It's not fair looking out their window<br> and see your ass asleep on the streets!<br> Yes, I agree.<br> That's very good.<br> You believe this drunk?<br> Me neither, man. Do it!<br> Hold, varlet...<br> or feel the sting of my shaft!<br> In the name of Blanche De Fleur,<br> unhand that errant knight!<br> Do you speak English?<br> Let the bum go, dipshit.<br> Mendacity!<br> Why are two city squires like you...<br> abusing a knight like this?<br> You a faggot?<br> Faggot? No, but I do believe<br> in fairies.<br> - Not without dinner.<br> - You fucking nuts?<br> Viola! Let's show him what he's won.<br> I advise you to let us go.<br> - You advise us?<br> - Yes. You're outnumbered, son. See?<br> Looks like "Night of the Living Dead."<br> Come on! Go for it!<br> - They can't do nothin'.<br> - "Can't do nothin'."<br> Nothing?<br> Gentlemen.<br> I like New York in June<br> How about you<br> I like a Gershwin tune<br> How about you<br> Look, it's show time.<br> You know, boys...<br> there's three things in this world<br> that you need:<br> Respect for all kinds of life...<br> a nice bowel movement<br> on a regular basis...<br> and a navy blazer.<br> One more thing.<br> Never take your eye off the ball!<br> Of course, the ability to bean<br> a shithead can be a fabulous advantage.<br> Please, don't hurt me.<br> Why? So you can be healthy<br> when you jump? No.<br> You can't leave me tied up here alone,<br> you fucking faggot!<br> Oh, you're not gonna be alone.<br> Come and get it!<br> I need a drink.<br> I know a fabulous place<br> with great ambiance.<br> What do you think of the death penalty?<br> Death's definitely a penalty.<br> It ain't no fuckin' gift.<br> Life's too goddamn short.<br> Great place, huh?<br> - How are you tonight?<br> - Not bad, John. And you?<br> - Can't complain.<br> - Can I interest anybody in a fruit pie?<br> No, thank you. Too fattening.<br> - Have a drink.<br> - I better be leaving.<br> Drink, goddamn it!<br> I think they like you.<br> I like New York in June<br> How about you<br> You were great tonight, Parry.<br> I like potato chips<br> and moonlight and roses<br> How about you<br> Welcome back.<br> How you feeling?<br> Have I died?<br> Easy. You want to get up?<br> There you go.<br> Gravity works.<br> Take it real slow. There you go.<br> - Take a few breaths.<br> - Where am l?<br> It's my domicile.<br> It's my humble abode.<br> Mi casa is su casa.<br> Want something to eat? Your stomach must<br> be a real tabula rasa after last night.<br> These are raisins or rat shit.<br> You can't tell sometimes.<br> Oh ! How about a fruit pie?<br> You're right.<br> I was off a couple months.<br> It's nice to have company.<br> Hi.<br> - Where are my shoes?<br> - What?<br> Excuse me.<br> What is it? I've got company.<br> What?<br> I knew it. I knew it last night.<br> I did too.<br> Don't look at me.<br> He's the one.<br> - Can you keep a secret?<br> - No.<br> Good. Because you know what<br> the little people told me?<br> The little people?<br> You know.<br> They said you're the one.<br> The one what?<br> Shut up!<br> Get away from him!<br> This will get them.<br> Wintergreen.<br> I'm sorry about this.<br> There we are.<br> They said you're not ready<br> to know yet.<br> I'm not.<br> He is too!<br> Get out of here!<br> Beat it! I have Raid!<br> Oh, yeah, fly up there.<br> Move out. Out of here.<br> You can't be in there.<br> You're frightening him.<br> - You know who I am?<br> - I'm drawing a blank.<br> Take a guess.<br> Let him guess.<br> I don't know. You seem to be<br> some kind of vigilante?<br> That happens along the way, of course,<br> but here's a clue.<br> A hood ornament.<br> No. I'm a knight...<br> on a special quest.<br> And I need help.<br> Quest.<br> That's why they sent you.<br> - The little--<br> - Yes. Yes.<br> You see, they work for Him.<br> So do l.<br> Him?<br> God.<br> I'm the janitor of God.<br> I know.<br> Yeah. I know how you feel.<br> They came to me about a year ago.<br> I was sitting on the john having one<br> of those satisfying bowel movements.<br> Those ones that border on mystical?<br> Where you're like--<br> And there they were.<br> Hundreds of the cutest<br> little tat people...<br> floating right in front of me.<br> It was wonderful.<br> And then...<br> they spoke.<br> They said I had been chosen<br> to get back something very special...<br> that He had lost,<br> and my part would be dangerous.<br> I said, "Whoa! Hold it right there."<br> You start seeing little fat people that<br> tell you you're on a mission from God...<br> they'll slap you<br> some heavy Thorazine.<br> I said, "Give me a sign."<br> They said, "Look in<br> 'Progressive Architecture'...<br> February '88, page 33."<br> That's pretty specific, huh?<br> Bingo! He knows.<br> He knows. It's right here.<br> Where is it?<br> A, B, F, M!<br> It's under miscellaneous,<br> not mythology.<br> Look at this. Here it is.<br> Right there. See it?<br> Langdon Carmichael.<br> Right there. See it?<br> What?<br> The grail.<br> The Holy Grail.<br> It's God's symbol of divine grace.<br> The Holy--<br> Some billionaire has the Holy Grail<br> in his library on Fifth Avenue.<br> Who'd think you'd find anything divine<br> on the Upper East Side?<br> I don't mean to be flippant<br> or enrage you...<br> but you're a psychotic man.<br> A very nice psychotic man.<br> I appreciate what you did.<br> I think it was a brave and noble thing.<br> You're embarrassing me.<br> I'm sure I'll see of lot of you<br> on talk shows when you get the grail.<br> Please, don't go!<br> I can't.<br> I can't get it...<br> 'cause he's out there.<br> He's always out there.<br> That's why you can get it.<br> That's why you're the one.<br> I'm not the one.<br> I'm not anyone.<br> Forget about the shoes.<br> - I'm gonna take a cab--<br> - Parry.<br> - I'm Jack.<br> - I know.<br> Wait. Don't--<br> They're-- Here they are!<br> - Here you go.<br> - Thanks.<br> You can keep the doll.<br> Thanks a mil, huh?<br> Now that you know where we are,<br> don't be a stranger.<br> Come back. We'll rummage.<br> Take care of yourself, Jack.<br> Give my love to the wife.<br> I'm not married.<br> Really? You look married.<br> Don't be a stranger.<br> See ya.<br> Hey, where you coming from?<br> The basement, I think.<br> I tell him no visitors!<br> Hold it.<br> You a friend of Parry's?<br> I don't allow no entertaining.<br> I let him stay here out of the goodness<br> of my heart because of the tragedy...<br> but I'm not running a hotel,<br> and nobody's taking advantage of me.<br> Tragedy?<br> He and his wife were in some bar...<br> and some nut comes in with a shotgun<br> and blew the place apart.<br> Splattered her brains<br> all over the walls.<br> She was a beautiful girl.<br> Never knew what hit her.<br> You heard about that,<br> that nut who listened to the radio?<br> You could've been attacked,<br> raped, God knows what!<br> I was up all night, Jack!<br> Sorry.<br> - A guy wants to check out pornos.<br> - So send him back.<br> - What the hell happened?<br> - I was attacked.<br> What?<br> Oh, baby!<br> Two kids tried to set me on tire.<br> What did they do to you?<br> You almost done? Are you looking<br> for a story, what?<br> - I've seen most of them.<br> - "Creamer Versus Creamer." Won an award<br> Go.<br> Did you call the police?<br> Do you want me to call the doctor?<br> No, I'm fine.<br> Are you sure?<br> So where did you sleep last night?<br> I stayed at a friend's, Anne.<br> Okay, Jack, I want you<br> to be up front with me.<br> It you're seeing somebody else,<br> just tell me.<br> You don't have to pour gasoline<br> on yourself and light a match...<br> just to break up with me.<br> Just tell me the truth.<br> I was not seeing anyone else.<br> I really was attacked.<br> - I've got a cut here.<br> - Okay, I see it now. I'm sorry.<br> I love you.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> You don't have to say it back...<br> although it wouldn't break your jaw<br> to try.<br> - You know what the Holy Grail is?<br> - Holy Grail?<br> Yeah, I know that one.<br> That was like Jesus' juice glass.<br> Yeah, I used to be such a Catholic.<br> - You still believe in God?<br> - You gotta believe in God.<br> But I don't believe God made men<br> in His image...<br> 'cause most of the shit that happens<br> is 'cause of men.<br> No. I think man was made<br> in the devil's image...<br> and women were created out of God...<br> 'cause after all, women can have babies,<br> which is kind of like creating.<br> And which also accounts for the tact<br> that women are attracted to men.<br> 'Cause let's face it, the devil<br> is a hell of a lot more interesting.<br> I've slept with some saints in my day,<br> and I know what I'm talking about.<br> Boring.<br> So the whole point of life...<br> I think,<br> is for men and women...<br> to get married so that<br> God and the devil can get together...<br> and work it out.<br> Not that we have to get married<br> or anything.<br> God forbid.<br> You have a little thing right here.<br> A pimple?<br> This stuff is supposed to blend with<br> my skin. Like it really works.<br> I don't think I'm up for it tonight,<br> honey.<br> I just had<br> a very traumatic experience.<br> I know.<br> I'm getting sick.<br> Careful, careful.<br> Anne, I spent the night<br> in a boiler room.<br> I'm tired. I'm upset.<br> I'm not in the mood, okay?<br> Parry?<br> Parry?<br> Can I help you?<br> I was looking for Parry.<br> He's not here.<br> The hospital said it would be best<br> it we kept certain things away from him.<br> There's his real name.<br> Henry Sagan.<br> He was a teacher<br> at Hunter College.<br> They kept him in a mental place<br> over on Staten Island.<br> He did not speak for a year.<br> Then all of a sudden he started talking.<br> Only now he's this Parry guy.<br> He and his wife<br> used to live upstairs.<br> When he got released,<br> they sent him here.<br> I felt bad.<br> He couldn't work.<br> Nobody wanted him.<br> So I let him stay in the basement.<br> He helped out.<br> I gave him a couple of dollars.<br> People throw things away,<br> he gets them.<br> She was a beautiful girl.<br> He was crazy about her.<br> I appreciate the way<br> you deal with people.<br> - I really do. I'm a big fan.<br> - Good. I enjoy appreciation.<br> I especially appreciated the other day<br> when you told that homeless schmuck...<br> who does he think he is<br> talking about the money that you made.<br> Who was he to ask Jack Lucas anything?<br> - Asshole.<br> - A scumbag like that?<br> I liked the way you dealt with him.<br> It was perfect Jack Lucas style.<br> I listen to you every day,<br> and I'm telling you...<br> you are a consistent,<br> integral man.<br> What's the matter, baby?<br> Can't sleep?<br> Yeah.<br> I'll tell you something, Anne.<br> I really feel cursed.<br> Stop it.<br> Things will change.<br> I feel like I'm a magnet,<br> but I attract shit.<br> Out of all the people in the city...<br> why did I meet a man<br> whose wife I killed?<br> You didn't kill anybody.<br> Stop it.<br> I wish there was some way I could...<br> just pay the tine and go home.<br> I know, I know.<br> Oh, baby.<br> Have you seen Parry?<br> Deign, Princess,<br> to remember thy faithful slave...<br> who now endures such misery<br> for love of thee.<br> - Parry?<br> - Hi, Jack.<br> - I thought you could use a couple--<br> - Come on.<br> She'll be back.<br> Isn't she a vision?<br> Yeah, gorgeous.<br> I just wanted to--<br> Wait. Hey, look.<br> I'm leaving.<br> I just wanted to give you--<br> Shit!<br> Wait.<br> Now!<br> No. Come here.<br> This way.<br> Down!<br> She buys a new book every two days.<br> Hey, sweetheart!<br> What the hell you doing?<br> She's into trash,<br> but what are you going to do?<br> Come here.<br> She loves dumplings.<br> That's her Wednesday ritual.<br> It's so sweet<br> how she does that every time.<br> We're looking through the window!<br> You got a problem with that, buddy?<br> I'm looking through the tucking window.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> It anybody told me I'd love a girl who<br> chews jawbreakers, I'd say they're nuts.<br> Look at that jaw.<br> There she goes.<br> You follow her every day?<br> It's not like that.<br> I'm deeply smitten.<br> - What's her name?<br> - I don't know.<br> A cooler!<br> That's beautiful.<br> It needs a little work.<br> Here. Come here.<br> I just would like to help you.<br> Fifty dollars?<br> All right, look.<br> Here's another $20.<br> Will that do it?<br> Seventy dollars?<br> How much is this gonna take?<br> You're so nice.<br> That's okay.<br> You mensch, you.<br> Can I take you to lunch?<br> No. I gotta go back to work.<br> Take care of yourself.<br> Sell !<br> Buy!<br> Fuck 'em all!<br> What are you doing?<br> Give that back!<br> What are you doing?<br> Let go! Let go!<br> - What the fuck are you doing?<br> - Why did you do that?<br> - I gave that to you !<br> - What will I do with it?<br> I gave it to you to help you,<br> not him.<br> Do you really want to help me?<br> Okay, open your eyes.<br> Pretty impressive, huh?<br> But don't let it scare you.<br> As formidable as it seems, everything<br> has its weakness. There's no moat.<br> You can't just break into<br> Langdon Carmichael's house.<br> - This man's done nothing--<br> - Hey! I'll deal with this.<br> Let's go through this one more time.<br> Listen to me.<br> Don't start drooling or rolling<br> your eyes when I tell you this.<br> You shouldn't be doing this.<br> There is no Holy Grail.<br> Oh, Jack! Ye of little faith.<br> There has to be a grail.<br> What were the crusades?<br> The pope's publicity stunt?<br> You heathen!<br> There's a grail.<br> Wait a minute. Look.<br> You're only partly insane.<br> People like you can lead<br> semi-normal lives. You can get a job.<br> I have a job, Jack.<br> I have a quest.<br> I take it back.<br> You're tucking deranged.<br> You'll get killed<br> trying to get in there.<br> That's so sweet.<br> I know what you're trying to do.<br> You're trying to protect me.<br> You think there's danger.<br> I think you're a moron,<br> and I don't want to get in trouble.<br> You care.<br> First the money, now this.<br> That's so sweet!<br> You fabulous guy!<br> Don't hug me in public again.<br> Men with men. Oh, Jack!<br> I love this guy!<br> You hear me?<br> I love this guy!<br> You hear me, jaded city?<br> I love Jack! He cares!<br> In this jaded motherfucking city,<br> that you--<br> Will you shut up?<br> I'm loopy about this guy!<br> Oh, Jack!<br> You're a real human being.<br> You're a friend.<br> A true friend.<br> I'm not, believe me.<br> - I'm scum.<br> - I'm not gonna listen.<br> - You're an honest-to-goodness good guy.<br> - I'm self-centered, I'm weak.<br> I don't have the willpower<br> of a fly on shit.<br> That's why the little people sent you.<br> They knew that. It's like magic.<br> I don't believe in little<br> floating people, okay?<br> There is no magic.<br> But you're still gonna help me.<br> That's what matters.<br> Parry, or whatever your name is,<br> you know none of this is true.<br> The grail, the voices. There's a part<br> of you that knows it's not true!<br> - We have to start planning now.<br> - Listen to me!<br> Jack, you're acting weird.<br> - I know who you are.<br> - Jack, let go of me!<br> You used to teach at Hunter College.<br> Parry, you're a teacher.<br> What are you looking at?<br> What?<br> He's afraid of you.<br> We've got him!<br> Come on !<br> Holy shit!<br> Yes! I got him, Jack!<br> Yes!<br> I've got you!<br> I'm dying.<br> I can't breathe.<br> Isn't this a beautiful spot?<br> Who have we been chasing?<br> Can I ask this question now?<br> He's gone now.<br> We had him on the run, didn't we? If<br> we'd had horses, we'd have had his ass.<br> - Who?<br> - What?<br> Who have we been chasing?<br> I thought you saw him.<br> Saw who?<br> The Red Knight.<br> I gave you money.<br> You want to keep it, tine.<br> You want to give it away, fine.<br> I just want You to know<br> I did give him the money, okay?<br> Are we clear?<br> Who are you talking to?<br> Help me, somebody!<br> Please!<br> Heaven be praised for the opportunity<br> to fulfill the duties of my profession.<br> These cries proceed from a miserable<br> male or female in need of my protection.<br> This is too hard.<br> Help me!<br> Will you, lady on the horse,<br> please trample me?<br> Over here.<br> No! Get away from me!<br> I'm not gonna hurt you.<br> That's what the other guy said.<br> Leave me alone! Please!<br> - I want to help you.<br> - No. I want to go. Let me go now.<br> They knocked the stuffing--<br> Come on. Let me help you up.<br> No. I want a debutante on a horse<br> to step on me.<br> Leave me alone.<br> Sorry to tell you this, but the days<br> of the debutantes are over.<br> Isn't it awful?<br> Poor little Gloria.<br> Poor Brenda Frazier.<br> They ruined them.<br> They ate them alive.<br> What about Slim Keith,<br> that little Guggenheim girl?<br> Impostors!<br> Leave me alone.<br> - Come on, lend a hand.<br> - He needs to sleep it off.<br> - Somebody will take care of him.<br> - Who? Mother Teresa? She's retired.<br> - It's just us. Let's go.<br> - Maybe he wants to stay here.<br> - You want to stay here?<br> - Sure. I'll love bleeding in horseshit.<br> How very "Gandhi-esque" of you.<br> Get out of the way!<br> Dr. Klein to physiotherapy.<br> Please! I was born in a place like this.<br> I don't want to be here.<br> - Please.<br> - Come on.<br> Jack, take care of him.<br> No, no. I want to go.<br> Please let me go.<br> - Where do you want to go?<br> - To a nice place I know about.<br> - Maybe we can go there later.<br> - We can't go there tonight.<br> - Maybe we can. Where do you want to go?<br> - We can't.<br> Come on. Maybe we can.<br> Where do you want to go?<br> Venice.<br> Like Katharine Hepburn<br> in "Summertime."<br> Why can't I be Katharine Hepburn?<br> I want to die!<br> I just want to die.<br> That's it.<br> Okay, ready?<br> I like New York in June<br> - I'm in the wrong place.<br> - Aren't we all?<br> I like a Gershwin tune<br> Don't hold back. Okay!<br> - I like to read good books<br> - What will I do with the children?<br> Where am I gonna put them?<br> Goddamn daughter-in-law!<br> Comes in the house<br> looking for dust balls.<br> Get the fuck out of my dining room,<br> you asshole!<br> That's wonderful feeling,<br> but you're stretching.<br> Come on, tempo.<br> Allegro, people, allegro.<br> When you--<br> Did you lose your mind all of a sudden,<br> or was it a slow, gradual process?<br> Well...<br> I'm a singer by trade.<br> Summer stock, nightclub reviews,<br> that sort of thing.<br> And God,<br> I absolutely lived for it.<br> I can do "Gypsy." Every part.<br> I can do it backwards.<br> Then one night, right in the middle<br> of singing "Funny"...<br> suddenly it hit me.<br> What does all this mean?<br> I mean, that, plus the tact<br> I'd watched all my friends die.<br> Sound like a veteran, don't l?<br> - Fuck off!<br> - My dad would be so proud of me.<br> - Pizza!<br> - It's about time.<br> Never gonna find her in this crowd.<br> She's like clockwork. She comes<br> through here at the same time every day.<br> She's late.<br> Thank you.<br> Parry?<br> Did you hear Jimmy Nichols<br> got picked up yesterday?<br> Oh, yeah?<br> He got caught<br> pissing on a bookstore.<br> Man's a pig.<br> No excuse for that.<br> Thank you, babe.<br> We're headed for social anarchy<br> when people start pissing on bookstores.<br> Asshole.<br> Didn't even look at you.<br> Well, he's paying<br> so he don't have to look.<br> A guy goes to work every day,<br> Gets his nuts so tight...<br> he starts questioning<br> the very fabric of his existence.<br> Then one day about quittin' time...<br> the boss calls him into the office<br> and says...<br> "Bob, come on in here and kiss my ass<br> for me, will you?"<br> He says, "Hell with it.<br> I don't care what happens.<br> I just want to see his expression...<br> as I jam these scissors<br> into his arm."<br> Then he thinks of me.<br> He says, "Wait a minute.<br> I got both my arms, both my legs.<br> At least I'm not begging<br> for a living."<br> Sure enough, Bob's gonna put<br> those scissors down and pucker up.<br> I'm what you call a kind of<br> moral traffic light.<br> I'm like saying,<br> "Red. Go no further."<br> I do not need this!<br> I do not need this!<br> A woman my age?<br> I'm a person. There's a person here.<br> This is kid's stuff.<br> You come, you go.<br> All I do is cook like a jerk.<br> You're a waste of good lasagna.<br> I don't need this.<br> Find yourself another dope.<br> He's a son of a bitch.<br> God, what a beautiful night, Jack.<br> Don't you think it's time to go?<br> Running around here during the day<br> is one thing, but at night...<br> we could be killed<br> by a variety of people.<br> That's stupid, Jack.<br> This park is mine<br> as much as it is theirs.<br> Do you think it's fair they keep us out<br> because we might get killed?<br> - Yes, I think it's very fair.<br> - I don't.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm cloud busting.<br> Have you ever done it?<br> You lie on your back...<br> concentrate on the clouds and<br> break them apart with your mind.<br> It's wild. But you have to be nude.<br> You can't diffuse the psychic energy.<br> This is New York. No one's allowed<br> to be naked in a field in New York.<br> It's too midwestern.<br> It's wild. It's really treeing.<br> The air on your body, the nipples are<br> hard, little guy dangling in the wind.<br> Come on. You're pissing me off.<br> We're bare-assed naked<br> in the middle of it.<br> I'm not doing this. This is nuts.<br> I'm leaving.<br> Free yourself. You know why dogs<br> do this? 'Cause it feels good.<br> - I'm not doing that.<br> - Yes!<br> - I'm leaving.<br> - Come on, Jack. Get back to your roots.<br> The man talks to invisible people,<br> he sees invisible horses.<br> He's lying naked in the middle<br> of Central Park.<br> I'm not surprised. I'm out of<br> my tucking mind to even be here!<br> Who are you talking to?<br> - I'm talking to the little people.<br> - Are they here?<br> They're saying, "Jack, go to<br> the nearest liquor store...<br> findeth the Jack of Daniels...<br> that ye may be shit-taced!"<br> - They said that?<br> - You are out of your tucking mind!<br> Bingo!<br> Come on ! Free up the little guy.<br> let him flap in the breeze!<br> Oh, Jack!<br> Nothing's happening.<br> Concentrate.<br> What it some homophobic jogger<br> kills us...<br> to get back at his father?<br> "Jack Lucas found dead<br> next to a dead naked man.<br> The two were dead,<br> his companion was naked."<br> I hate it when they use the word<br> "companion." It's so insinuating.<br> Probably boosts the sales<br> of my biography.<br> The public is fascinated with celebrity<br> murders that involve nakedness.<br> Bastards.<br> I may be going out on a limb, but you<br> don't seem like a happy camper.<br> Did you ever hear the story<br> of the Fisher King?<br> It begins with the king as a boy having<br> to spend the night alone in a forest...<br> to prove his courage<br> so he can become king.<br> While he's spending the night alone...<br> he's visited by a sacred vision.<br> Out of the fire appears<br> the Holy Grail...<br> the symbol of God's divine grace.<br> And a voice said to the boy.<br> "You shall be keeper of the grail<br> so that it may heal the hearts of men."<br> But the boy was blinded<br> by greater visions of a life...<br> filled with power<br> and glory and beauty.<br> In this state<br> of radical amazement...<br> he felt for a brief moment<br> not like a boy...<br> but invincible...<br> like God.<br> So he reached in the fire<br> to take the grail...<br> and the grail vanished...<br> leaving him with his hand in the tire<br> to be terribly wounded.<br> Now, as this boy grew older...<br> his wound grew deeper...<br> until one day...<br> life for him lost its reason.<br> He had no faith in any man,<br> not even himself.<br> He couldn't love or feel loved.<br> He was sick with experience.<br> He began to die.<br> One day, a fool wandered<br> into the castle...<br> and found the king alone.<br> Being a tool, he was simpleminded.<br> He didn't see a king.<br> He only saw a man alone<br> and in pain.<br> He asked the king,<br> "What ails you, friend?"<br> The king replied...<br> "I'm thirsty. I need some water<br> to cool my throat."<br> So the fool took a cup from beside<br> his bed, tilled it with water...<br> and handed it to the king.<br> As the king began to drink...<br> he realized his wound was healed.<br> He looked in his hands,<br> and there was the Holy Grail...<br> that which he sought<br> all of his life.<br> He turned to the tool<br> and said with amazement...<br> "How could you find that which<br> my brightest and bravest could not?"<br> The tool replied, "I don't know.<br> I only knew<br> that you were thirsty."<br> It's beautiful, isn't it?<br> I think I heard that<br> at a lecture once. I don't know.<br> It was a professor...<br> at Hunter.<br> How come you never asked<br> that girl for a date?<br> I can't ask her.<br> I have to earn her.<br> This is the 20th century.<br> You don't have to earn a woman.<br> Maybe after we get the grail.<br> She could help you get the grail.<br> Women are great.<br> They make homes<br> and they kill the livestock...<br> so the knights can go out there<br> and get grails...<br> and slaughter villages<br> with a clear head.<br> Where would King Arthur be<br> without Guinevere?<br> Happily married, probably.<br> Well, that's a bad example,<br> but trust me on this.<br> A woman who loves you...<br> keeps you going,<br> gives you strength...<br> makes you feel<br> like you can do anything.<br> Is that what your girlfriend<br> does for you?<br> Sure. Yeah.<br> Get out of the fucking way!<br> Yes. Two Hearts Publishing?<br> May I speak to Lydia, please?<br> Lydia?<br> - Who is Lydia?<br> - I don't know her last name.<br> You are calling Lydia<br> from my apartment?<br> You must think I am some kind of dope,<br> you son of a bitch.<br> You stay out all night long.<br> I don't get a phone call.<br> You stroll in here at noon.<br> You think I need this?<br> I was not out with a woman last night.<br> I was with Parry.<br> - The moron?<br> - He's not a moron.<br> Who's Lydia?<br> Lydia is the girl<br> that Parry likes.<br> I thought--<br> - What did you think?<br> - You wouldn't understand.<br> Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.<br> That pisses me off.<br> - I'm sorry.

Tea?<br> A little tequila?<br> Will it hurt?<br> That all depends on you.<br> You sure you don't want a drink?<br> You just enjoy this.<br> That a boy.<br> - This is mud.<br> - We just washed that oft.<br> This is going to make you look great.<br> It's good mud.<br> Close...<br> lips.<br> - Close.<br> - What are you doing?<br> There we go.<br> Now, you just relax.<br> So, anybody special in your life?<br> Does it look like<br> there's anybody special in my life?<br> You don't have to say it like that.<br> It's not so crazy an idea.<br> You're a healthy woman.<br> You have a steady job.<br> You're not cross-eyed or anything.<br> - There is nobody special.<br> - Okay. Fine.<br> It's not easy<br> in this day and age.<br> What's not easy?<br> - Meeting people.<br> - Oh, God, tell me about it!<br> I've been dating longer<br> than I've been driving.<br> I can't believe that.<br> I have never been through<br> a dating period.<br> It's a disgusting process.<br> You haven't missed a thing.<br> - Hold still.<br> - I'm so excited.<br> Did you feel like this<br> when you first met Anne?<br> Because she's a wonderful woman.<br> She loves you too much, Jack.<br> But you love her, too, don't you?<br> You know you do. It's just that you're<br> a little bit of an asshole sometimes.<br> Sorry.<br> Thanks.<br> My mother calls once a week<br> like an ongoing nightmare.<br> "Have you met anyone?"<br> "No, Mom."<br> "What's going to happen?"<br> "I don't know, Mom."<br> Thank God I moved out of that house.<br> I cannot believe you lived with her<br> as long as you did.<br> It I had to live with my mother,<br> I would stab myself six times.<br> I think some people<br> are meant to be alone.<br> This is my idea, that I was born a man<br> in a former life...<br> and I used women for pleasure...<br> so now...<br> I'm paying for it.<br> I wouldn't mind so much it I could<br> just remember the pleasure parts.<br> I think you're getting<br> a little too complicated.<br> What, in your opinion,<br> is the actual problem?<br> I don't make an impression on people.<br> At office parties,<br> I rearrange the hors d'oeuvres...<br> while people are eating them<br> so the platters will remain full.<br> I never start any of the conversations<br> because I just don't know--<br> I don't know where<br> to make it end, to go.<br> Listen. You've got to be<br> a little easier on yourself, doll.<br> A conversation<br> has a life of its own.<br> You have to have some faith<br> in that fact.<br> I mean, look at us.<br> We're having...<br> a very lovely conversation.<br> I'm paying you.<br> Will you stop it? I'm not like that!<br> I don't do people favors.<br> It I talk to you, it's because<br> I want to talk to you.<br> All right, you're not a super model.<br> We can't all be Jerry Hall.<br> What a boring world<br> it we were all Jerry Hall.<br> You do the best you can<br> with what you got.<br> You're not so invisible.<br> Hey, you want a personality?<br> Try this on for size.<br> You can be a real bitch.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm going to give you my wallet<br> so you can pay for dinner.<br> You're a nice man, Jack,<br> doing all this for me.<br> - I'm scared.<br> - No, no, no.<br> I feel so much for her.<br> I feel like something<br> awful's going to happen.<br> Nothing awful is going to happen.<br> Anne is going to be there.<br> I'm gonna be there.<br> Nothing awful's going to happen. Okay?<br> - I'm still scared.<br> - I know. It's going to be fine.<br> Okay. All right.<br> You're looking good.<br> Just remember to breathe.<br> - Okay, I gotta breathe.<br> - Big breath.<br> Oh, please, no, stay.<br> - Look. It's Lydia Sinclair, our winner.<br> - I know.<br> What have you fellas been up to?<br> We thought we'd get some dinner.<br> Say, anybody up for Chinese?<br> Hmm?

Sorry.<br> Sorry.<br> It's hot.<br> Help her with that.<br> What do you think?<br> I think that they were made<br> for each other.<br> It's scary, but true.<br> I got it. You got it.<br> There it is. Okay.<br> Oh, Lydia, oh, Lydia<br> Say, have you met Lydia<br> Lydia, the tattooed lady<br> She has eyes that men adore so<br> And a torso even more so<br> Oh, Lydia, oh, Lydia<br> Say, have you met Lydia<br> Lydia, the Queen of Tattoos<br> On her back<br> is the Battle of Waterloo<br> The sight at the wreck<br> of the "Hesperus" too<br> And proudly above waves<br> the red, white and blue<br> You can learn a lot from Lydia<br> When her robe is unfurled<br> she will show you the world<br> If you step up and tell her where<br> For a dime, you can see<br> Kankakee or Paris<br> Or Washington crossing the Delaware<br> When her muscles start relaxing<br> Up the hill comes Michael Jackson<br> Did you see her with the noodles?<br> She had a noodle<br> hanging down her head.<br> I couldn't believe it.<br> Come on.<br> And then they started in<br> on the dumplings.<br> They were playing hockey<br> with the dumpling on the table.<br> - It was broccoli.<br> - No, it was a dumpling.<br> They were batting it around<br> with a chopstick.<br> Stop or I'll lose it right here.<br> - Yo, Lydia!<br> - Watch out.<br> Tell me more about yourself.<br> I'd like to know everything.<br> - There's nothing more to tell.<br> - Don't say that.<br> - No, that's it.<br> - It's enough for me.<br> - I really think she went for him.<br> - I know. I can't believe I did it.<br> What?<br> It's Latin.<br> It means "Love conquers all."<br> I don't mean us.<br> I mean everybody else.<br> - You think it'll work out?<br> - Who knows?<br> Two people could be at a party together<br> and never find each other.<br> Another two people could be<br> on opposite sides of the world...<br> and nothing could keep them apart.<br> The thing is, if a thing<br> is meant to happen--<br> What?<br> - Nothing. Go on.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> You must be very proud<br> of yourself.<br> You did a great thing<br> for somebody tonight.<br> I was very proud<br> to be with you tonight.<br> You were great.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> Steamed dumplings!<br> Mu shu pork!<br> You don't have to say that.<br> You don't have to say that.<br> I never say anything I have to.<br> I mean, you don't have to say<br> nice things to me.<br> It's a little old-fashioned<br> considering what we're about to do.<br> - What are we about to do?<br> - You're walking me home.<br> - I think you're attracted to me.<br> - Yeah.<br> And...<br> you'll probably want to come upstairs<br> for some coffee.<br> I don't drink coffee.<br> And we'll probably<br> have a drink and talk...<br> and get to know each other better,<br> get comfortable.<br> Then you'll--<br> You'll sleep over.<br> And in the morning,<br> you'll awake...<br> and you'll be distant.<br> And you won't be able<br> to stay for breakfast.<br> Maybe just a cup of coffee.<br> I don't drink coffee.<br> Then we'll exchange phone numbers...<br> and you'll leave...<br> and never call.<br> I'll go to work and I'll feel<br> so good for the first hour...<br> and then, ever so slowly,<br> I'll turn into a piece of dirt.<br> I don't know why<br> I'm putting myself through this.<br> It was really nice to meet you.<br> Night.<br> Excuse me! Wait. Just--<br> Sorry. Wait one minute.<br> Excuse me. Please wait.<br> - Wait.<br> - I'm not feeling very well.<br> No wonder. We just met, made love<br> and broke up in 30 seconds.<br> And I don't remember the first kiss<br> which I think is the best part.<br> It was so special to meet you--<br> It was for me, too. But I think<br> it's time you should shut up now.<br> Shut up, please?<br> I'm not coming up to your apartment.<br> That was never my intention.<br> - Oh, God! You don't want to.<br> - Oh, no, I want to!<br> I have a hard-on for you<br> the size of Florida.<br> But I don't want just one night.<br> I have a confession<br> I have to make to you.<br> You're married?<br> You're divorced?<br> - You have a disease?<br> - No. Please, stop.<br> I'm in love with you.<br> Not just from tonight.<br> I've known you for a long time.<br> I know you come from work at noon,<br> you fight your way out that door...<br> get pushed back in and three<br> seconds later, come back out again.<br> I know it it's a good day if you get<br> that romance novel at that bookstore.<br> I know what you order. On Wednesdays<br> you go to that dim sum parlor.<br> I know that you get a jawbreaker<br> before you go back in to work.<br> And I know you hate your job<br> and don't have many friends.<br> I know sometimes you feel<br> a little uncoordinated.<br> You don't feel as wonderful<br> as everybody else...<br> feeling as alone and separate<br> as you feel you are.<br> I love you.<br> And I think you're the greatest thing<br> since spice racks.<br> I'd be knocked out<br> if I could have that first kiss.<br> And I won't be distant.<br> I'll come back in the morning<br> and I'll call you it you let me.<br> But I still don't drink coffee.<br> You're real...<br> aren't you?<br> It's the wrong door.<br> You can call me.<br> She didn't give me the number.<br> Please let me have this.<br> Let me have it!<br> Where are you?<br> We're tired of looking at you people!<br> Thank you.<br> Yeah, well, I'm feeling good.<br> I don't know how else to put it.<br> Yeah, well, I had those personal<br> problems to work out, and I have.<br> And now I want to get back to work.<br> You think that's possible?<br> Yeah, I understand.<br> I am.

So the guy, he's been beat up.<br> He's got a concussion, right?<br> Right?<br> He's gonna snap out of it.<br> I'm afraid not.<br> See, the beating's bad,<br> but it's not the problem.<br> He seems to be reexperiencing<br> the catatonia.<br> Like before, he could<br> snap out of it in an hour...<br> or 13 months, 13 years.<br> There's no way to be sure.<br> A person could actually reexperience<br> the full effect of a tragedy...<br> long after the event took place.<br> I was reading how he lost his wife.<br> Are you relatives?<br> Well, it doesn't matter.<br> We'll take care of him.<br> He'll have to be sent back<br> to the same institution.<br> What if I was a relative?<br> You'd have the option<br> to care for him at home...<br> but I wouldn't recommend it.<br> It wouldn't be good for him.<br> He needs hospital care.<br> I just thought you could sign the<br> release forms, but the city can do that.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Poor Lydia.<br> She finally finds her prince,<br> and he falls into a coma.<br> Some women have no luck.<br> I'll call you, okay?<br> The answer: two dwarves and a melon.<br> Well, I'm out of here.<br> Have a perfect weekend.<br> And remember, on Monday we have as<br> our special studio guest, Ben Starr...<br> star of the recently defunct<br> hit TV show "On the Radio."<br> So, from one of the botched<br> to you bungled cats out there...<br> I love you,<br> and right back at you.<br> Yeah.<br> Lou, look, I said I want an otter<br> or they can forget it.<br> You tell them I'm talking<br> to the cable people about a talk show.<br> What?<br> Beth's father set it up.<br> No, he owns it.<br> - You gotta get outta here.<br> - I'm not bothering anybody.<br> You gotta move it.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Jack, it's me!<br> Stop it.<br> I know that guy.<br> Remember me?

Please!<br> You know this guy?<br> Why won't you talk to me?<br> Leave me alone!<br> Why?<br> It's a weekly comedy about the homeless,<br> but it's not depressing in any way.<br> We want to find a funny, upbeat way...<br> of bringing the issue<br> of homelessness to television.<br> So, we've got three wacky<br> homeless characters.<br> But they're wise.<br> They're wacky and wise.<br> And the hook is they love<br> being homeless.<br> They love the freedom,<br> the adventure.<br> It's all about the joy of living,<br> not the bullshit we deal with...<br> the money, the politics.<br> And the best part is,<br> it's called "Home Free."<br> I'm getting a rush.<br> What is this,<br> another disappearing act?<br> It's not a problem.<br> It's a bathroom break.<br> I'll check.<br> Shit!<br> - Parry.<br> - Damn.<br> What?<br> It's a grail!<br> The Holy Grail.<br> The Holy--<br> Some billionaire has got the Holy Grail<br> in his library on Fifth Avenue?<br> Exactly.

Just make sure<br> he does get them when they are cleaned.<br> Hi. It's Jack.<br> How are you doing?<br> You're looking good.<br> Yes, you do.<br> You going to wake up for me?<br> This isn't over, is it?<br> You think you're going<br> to make me do this, don't you?<br> Forget it.<br> No tucking way.<br> I don't feel responsible<br> for you or anybody.<br> Everybody's got bad things<br> that happen to them. I'm not God!<br> I don't decide--<br> People survive.<br> Say something!<br> Everything's been going great.<br> Great.<br> I'm going to have<br> my own cable talk show...<br> with an incredible equity,<br> I might add.<br> I've got an incredible incredibly<br> fucking gorgeous girlfriend.<br> I'm living an incredible<br> tucking life.<br> So don't lay there<br> in your comfortable coma...<br> and think I'm going to risk all that<br> because I feel responsible for you.<br> I'm not responsible!<br> I don't feel guilty.<br> You've got it easy.<br> I'm out there every day,<br> every tucking day...<br> trying to figure out<br> what the hell I'm doing.<br> Why no matter what I have,<br> it feels like I have nothing.<br> So I don't feel sorry for you.<br> It's easy being nuts.<br> Try being me!<br> So I won't do it.<br> I don't believe in this shit.<br> Don't give me that stuff<br> about me being the one.<br> There's nothing...<br> nothing special about me.<br> I control my own destiny,<br> not some...<br> floating overweight fairies.<br> I decide what I'm going to do,<br> and I'm not going to risk my life...<br> to get some fucking cup<br> for some tucking vegetable!<br> You motherfucker!<br> What am I supposed to do?<br> Cup.<br> All right. For the sake of argument,<br> let's say I do do this.<br> It I do this...<br> I want you to know it wouldn't be<br> because I felt I had to...<br> or because I felt cursed<br> or guilty or responsible.<br> It I do this--<br> It I do this...<br> and I mean if...<br> it's because<br> I want to do this for you.<br> That's all.<br> For you.<br> Don't go anywhere.<br> Shit!<br> Great.<br> I'm hearing horses now.<br> Parry will be so pleased.<br> Radio personality turns screwball<br> on mission from God.<br> I just hope when they put me away,<br> they find me a place right next to his.<br> Fuck!<br> Thank God nobody looks up<br> in this town.<br> Shit.<br> Shit!<br> "To Lannie Carmichael.<br> Christmas, 1932."<br> Shit.<br> Hey, come on.
