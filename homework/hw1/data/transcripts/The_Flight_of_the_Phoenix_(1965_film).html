                        Mr. Moran, we going to be on time<br> in Benghazi?<br> I don't see why not, Gabriele.<br> I'll ask Captain Towns<br> to make a special point of it.<br> Voltage regulators inoperative.<br> Holding course for Benghazi.<br> Thanks, Mike.<br> I'll let you have them back.<br> - How's it going up there?<br> - Lousy.<br> Never taken off in one of Arabco's<br> old tubs without something being wrong.<br> This time we've got faulty regulators<br> and a duff radio.<br> Don't let that hold you up.<br> I've got two months' leave coming.<br> It's not the company's time<br> we're flying on.<br> Radios are no good anyway.<br> I got a radio.<br> Record players are nice, though.<br> Reliable.<br> Thank you, doctor.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - No, thank you.<br> It's good of you<br> to give the Army a lift.<br> Not at all.<br> That's not much good, is it, sergeant?<br> Stow it away with the cargo.<br> The number four control pulley<br> on the starboard side seems a bit noisy.<br> Perhaps binding a bit.<br> I couldn't see properly.<br> I don't feel it up here.<br> I'd better have a look.<br> Hand me the flashlight.<br> - Ready for another flying lesson?<br> - Haven't recovered from the last one.<br> Oh, now, I got her<br> all trimmed up for you.<br> Just hold her straight.<br> Straight and level, 20 degrees.<br> Here, I'll take that.<br> Straight. Now, don't over-control it.<br> Don't sway it.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Don't leave me holding<br> this thing forever, will you?<br> Hi, skipper.<br> How are you?<br> Hey, Mr. Bill. Here, try this.<br> It's real good for you. One drink, the girl<br> comes out of the picture and bites you.<br> Hey, skipper, you want some ouzo?<br> - Make you fly real good.<br> - No thanks, son. I'm driving.<br> I reckon I deserve this. Listening to that<br> wog music has given me a headache.<br> The pulley's all right.<br> Squeaking a little, that's all.<br> - How are you getting along?<br> - Magnificently.<br> But I think someone up there<br> knows that I'm flying this thing.<br> That's quite a sandstorm<br> he's sending our way.<br> Yep, I've seen it.<br> So much for your weather report.<br> Let's have a look at that chart.<br> - If it closes in on us...<br> - This old bird will need a coat of paint.<br> - What alternate did you nominate?<br> - El Aouzzad.<br> Three mud huts and a poison well.<br> That's not a place, that's a disease.<br> Oh, now, Lew, don't worry. We're not<br> about to start turning to alternates yet.<br> We're bigger than<br> a little local sandstorm.<br> Old Auntie at traffic<br> management's gonna have kittens.<br> A pilot is supposed to use his own<br> judgment, don't you think?<br> Gee, if it weren't for that...<br> I don't know, Lew, I suppose pilots are<br> just as good now as they ever were...<br> ...but they sure don't live<br> the way we did.<br> Well, I can tell you<br> that there were times...<br> ...when you took real pride<br> in just getting there.<br> Flying used to be fun.<br> It really did, Lew.<br> It used to be fun.<br> - You don't think perhaps we should...?<br> - Head for the alternate?<br> You better take a look out the window.<br> We're being followed.<br> There goes our alternate.<br> That stuff up ahead<br> looks like it's rising.<br> I think we'd better find out<br> just how high it does go.<br> I must say, without the radio,<br> I would have expected them...<br> ...to turn for the alternate airport<br> by now.<br> Wouldn't you?<br> I don't know you, do I, boy?<br> Are you from the oil field?<br> My brother is there. Dorfmann.<br> I went to visit him on my holiday.<br> - You went to visit your brother in Jebel?<br> - Yes.<br> He's chief analytical geophysicist<br> for the Arabco Oil Company.<br> That pilot...<br> I would have thought he was a little<br> elderly to be flying without a co-pilot.<br> Wouldn't you?<br> That sand's a bastard, you know that?<br> A real bastard.<br> Hey, Standish. Not while the train's<br> in the station.<br> It's not gonna let up, Frank.<br> There she goes.<br> Are we gonna put her down?<br> That right engine didn't make it,<br> the other one probably won't either.<br> We're gonna have to put her down<br> before this one quits.<br> Can you get any lift out of her at all?<br> Well, maybe enough to hop over<br> a few sand dunes.<br> I'm gonna have to make it<br> on the first try.<br> We going in with our wheels down?!<br> I'd give anything not to,<br> but we'll never get up again if I don't.<br> No, I suppose not.<br> What's happening? What is it?<br> - The lights are shorting out.<br> - It's gonna start a fire.<br> The cargo!<br> It's breaking apart!<br> Lew?<br> Lew?<br> Come on, come on. Get a flashlight.<br> Let me out of here.<br> Come on, run. Run!<br> It's gonna blow!<br> Get away from the plane!<br> Maria.<br> Maria!<br> Harris, keep those guys together.<br> She won't burn now.<br> Get them under the wing<br> before we lose somebody.<br> Lew, see if you can get<br> the emergency lighting...<br> There are three trapped at the back.<br> Three trapped in the back!<br> Dr. Renaud!<br> Dr. Renaud!<br> Dr. Renaud!<br> Come on. Come on!<br> - Careful.<br> - All together now. Easy.<br> Here it comes.<br> The leg is entirely crushed.<br> See if you can find my bag.<br> - What about the other two back here?<br> - They've had it.<br> They've what?<br> Frank.<br> Skipper!<br> What are we gonna do now?<br> Do you want to say something?<br> Like what? "Sorry"?<br> There. Make it secure, will you?<br> Captain, don't you think it's time<br> we started getting things organized?<br> Yes, you're right.<br> I'll get Sergeant Watson to make up<br> some containers for flares.<br> - We'll need some of your fuel.<br> - Leave that to Moran.<br> Maybe you'd better check on our water<br> supply and figure up some rationing.<br> How much longer do you estimate<br> we'll have to be here?<br> I mean, I take it there will be<br> an air search before long.<br> Yes, well, we're not due<br> in Benghazi till... Well, now.<br> He's a right little organizer,<br> your captain.<br> Yeah, they're all the same.<br> Toffee-nosed bunch of gits.<br> You shouldn't have joined,<br> should you?<br> I never did. I was what they call<br> a boy soldier. Me dad joined me.<br> - Did he?<br> - Attendant at the public baths, he was.<br> November 21 st, 1934.<br> Me mum made me a sponge cake<br> for me birthday tea.<br> Next morning the old man walked me<br> down our street right into the barracks.<br> "You'll be all right," he said.<br> "You'll like it. I know you will."<br> for bleeding life, did you?<br> I don't know.<br> One thing leads to another, doesn't it?<br> Hey, Fritz!<br> Give us the loan of your book<br> when you're finished.<br> I don't think you'll find it interesting.<br> Oh, incidentally...<br> ...my name is Dorfmann,<br> Heinrich Dorfmann.<br> Go on. Is it really?<br> Yes.<br> Hey, sergeant. His name's Dorfmann,<br> Heinrich Dorfmann.<br> - What's the matter, doc?<br> - Nothing, Mr. Cobb. Nothing.<br> - How are you feeling today?<br> - All right.<br> What do you care?<br> Anyway, why ask me?<br> You got it written down<br> in that little black book.<br> No, no. I have nothing written down,<br> Mr. Cobb. Nothing.<br> Yeah?<br> - Then why don't you show it to me?<br> - Any time you wish.<br> Right now, though, I have to have<br> a look at Gabriele.<br> What a crummy quack.<br> They're all alike.<br> What... What about my wife, doctor?<br> No, don't think about it now.<br> She'll be all right. She'll be fine.<br> Do you have any kind of liquor<br> onboard?<br> Well, there's still some morphine left.<br> Wouldn't that be better?<br> I would like to save it<br> for when the pain gets worse.<br> Doctor.<br> Pilot error.<br> All right if we issue<br> the water ration now?<br> Sure, go ahead.<br> - Work something out?<br> - Yes, I think so.<br> Could I have your attention, please?<br> We have something important<br> to say concerning our water supply.<br> Now, there is just under<br> a full measure for each of us here.<br> Dr. Renaud informs me that we shall<br> require, as an absolute minimum...<br> ...one pint of water per person<br> per day. Is that right?<br> Yes, that's right.<br> Now, on the basis of the 15 gallons<br> in the emergency tank...<br> ...that gives us roughly 10 to 11 days.<br> That is, of course, if we just sit here<br> and don't exert ourselves in any way.<br> Hey, Lightning, do you hear that?<br> You're not to wear yourself out.<br> As we are somewhat off our original<br> course, unless we are certain...<br> ...of being picked up, we ought to make<br> do with the absolute minimum.<br> - Is that understood?<br> - Hear, hear.<br> - Hear, hear.<br> - Yeah.<br> - All right, Mr. Towns?<br> - Sounds reasonable.<br> If we have enough water<br> for all that time...<br> ...couldn't we set aside<br> a little bit for washing?<br> - Washing?<br> - What a dumb thing.<br> Hey, captain.<br> What are we supposed to do for grub?<br> I reckon we ought to eat the monkey.<br> As far as food is concerned,<br> we seem to be singularly fortunate.<br> There happens to be an almost unlimited<br> supply of pressed dates on board.<br> - Pressed dates?<br> - All they're good for is regularity.<br> Yes, I quite agree.<br> They were being sent back from Jebel<br> because nobody would eat them.<br> Yes, I think that's about all.<br> That's about all?<br> That's enough, isn't it?<br> Thank you.<br> Excuse me, but shouldn't some kind<br> of rescue plane have seen us by now?<br> Don't worry. Someone will be along<br> even before you can think about lunch.<br> Our accounts people will be waiting<br> for my Jebel operation report...<br> ...before they can get started<br> on the annual figures.<br> How big a hole will a busted-up<br> sky truck make in your annual figures?<br> There will be insurance, but insurance<br> companies move in mysterious ways.<br> Like God, of course,<br> but not half as generous.<br> - It's bound to be a setback.<br> - I imagine it will be.<br> Anyway, you don't have to worry.<br> They'll be here.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> It will work very well.<br> The captain says our chances are good.<br> - A bit optimistic, aren't you?<br> - I don't think so.<br> Well, being 130 miles off-course<br> isn't exactly going to help.<br> It's not gonna stop them either.<br> Music while you work?<br> It's mine. I bought it.<br> We could use this thing<br> to find out what's happening.<br> Nobody told...<br> He did say something about it, Frank.<br> It's my fault. I should have...<br> It's mine.<br> What's the matter with this thing?<br> Look at Heinrich, will you?<br> Hey, shut that damn thing off!<br> What are you trying to prove?<br> I'm trying to remain reasonably clean.<br> You think this is some kind<br> of a picnic?<br> That's just a local station<br> relaying a political broadcast.<br> I don't think you'll find any stations<br> we'd want until nightfall.<br> Doctor, what was that chap<br> talking about, anyway?<br> Water conservation<br> and a five-year plan for irrigation.<br> A fat lot of use that is.<br> What this country needs<br> is a few more pubs.<br> Fold it up. Get this stuff furled.<br> Tie it on so it won't blow away.<br> Get that line.<br> Give a hand. Pull, man.<br> - This darn wind's too much.<br> - Hold it, hold it.<br> Don't let it get away.<br> Close it up! Come on!<br> Close it up! Okay, now, get aboard.<br> Push. Push.<br> Get in there, lock it up!<br> Here it comes!<br> Get inside. Come on!<br> Let's get the door closed.<br> How are you feeling?<br> Better have some more of this.<br> Come on. Up you come.<br> I think you like this better than I do.<br> That's all right. As a matter of fact,<br> I've given it up.<br> How is he doing?<br> Oh, he's fine. We'll have him back<br> with his wife in no time.<br> But maybe too late.<br> No, you can't tell. Perhaps she'll<br> be better by the time you get there.<br> No, she would never send a cable.<br> My wife is a very modest person.<br> She'd send a cable<br> only if it were something bad.<br> Now, don't you worry.<br> We'll get you out of here.<br> He's right, Gabriele.<br> The sandstorm will make it<br> more difficult, won't it?<br> What, finding us?<br> No, simplify things no end, old chap.<br> They'll bloody well give up.<br> Are you frightened?<br> You don't want to be despondent,<br> old man.<br> Wait till the water runs out,<br> then you can really start laughing.<br> They wouldn't really just give up looking,<br> would they?<br> Never.<br> Don't you worry, me old duck,<br> they'll find us.<br> Trouble is, we'll all be dead.<br> Give that to the boy for a little while.<br> To the boy.<br> Thank you.<br> I told Standish we wouldn't<br> even have time to think about lunch.<br> That was three days ago.<br> This is our fifth day.<br> Most of them still believe it's only a<br> matter of time before we're picked up.<br> I wish I could be sure of that.<br> This heat is intolerable.<br> You should come here in the summer.<br> It's lovely.<br> Hey, sarge, look at this!<br> Hey, Abdul!<br> They went that way.<br> Abdul!<br> Your mates went flashing through here<br> on a herd of camels about an hour ago.<br> Can they see us?<br> - There it is.<br> - Where?<br> Yeah, I see it. Up there!<br> Hey! Down here!<br> - Down here!<br> - Down here!<br> - Hey!<br> - Down here!<br> Down here!<br> - Come on!<br> - Come down here!<br> Hey, come on! Get down here!<br> - Here we are!<br> - Down here!<br> - Come on!<br> - Hey! Hey!<br> - Hey!<br> - Come on!<br> - Come on down here!<br> - Come down here!<br> - Come on!<br> - Come back here!<br> It's pretty high.<br> Probably about 30,000.<br> More like 35. Couldn't be<br> the airlines, not in this area.<br> I don't think they could see<br> us even if they were looking for us.<br> - Hey!<br> - Come on!<br> No, I suppose not.<br> - Hey!<br> - All right, come on now, forget it.<br> - You're wasting time, they didn't see us.<br> - Bloody pilots.<br> All them flares do is make a lousy stink.<br> Might as well quit using them.<br> There'll be nothing.<br> Nobody could find us.<br> That's right, Standish. Nobody will.<br> It's time we tried to march out of here.<br> Oh?<br> You've heard the others.<br> You know what they're thinking?<br> It's five days,<br> we've had two sandstorms...<br> - ...we're not sure they're even looking.<br> - They're looking.<br> Nevertheless, if we're<br> Which way were you thinking<br> of marching, captain?<br> What is our nearest water point?<br> You can show me on your charts.<br> Well, yes, I can do that. How many<br> were you thinking of taking with you?<br> Well, apart from Sergeant Watson,<br> I don't know yet.<br> Well, perhaps now's<br> the time to find out.<br> Yes, perhaps it is.<br> - He can't walk out of here.<br> - No, of course he can't, but...<br> - He's entitled to try.<br> - He's not entitled to kill himself.<br> Oh, don't worry, Frank. I don't think<br> he's aware of the problems involved.<br> I'll get the maps.<br> Gentlemen, I made a decision<br> and I'd like you all to hear about it.<br> Now, I intend marching out of here.<br> The plan is to travel<br> at night when it's cool...<br> ...and then rest as best<br> we can during the day.<br> We leave at sundown this evening.<br> Sergeant Watson, would you come here?<br> I'll take Sergeant Watson and anybody<br> else who wants to come with me.<br> Volunteers, give me your names...<br> ...and we'll start making<br> the preparations.<br> Captain Harris?<br> You wanted to know our position.<br> If you'd like to come over here,<br> I'll show you.<br> Now, gentlemen, we're in<br> the middle of this circle...<br> ...which runs through<br> the three water points.<br> That's Marada in the north, Tazerbo<br> in the east and Namous in the south.<br> Marada is 106.<br> Say, London to Birmingham.<br> Marada's not a city,<br> it's a flea-bitten waterhole...<br> ...with some borax quarries,<br> an oil well and a few lousy palm trees.<br> Well, that's our objective then, Marada.<br> Say, captain...<br> ...you done much marching<br> in desert terrain?<br> - On exercises and that sort of thing.<br> - How far?<br> Ten or 15 miles.<br> Full equipment, of course.<br> - Plenty of water, I suppose?<br> - Sufficient.<br> Look, I don't know what your practical<br> navigation's like, mine's not bad.<br> But I wouldn't march<br> In the daytime,<br> it's hitting 120 in the shade...<br> ...and out there, there is no shade.<br> If you could take as much<br> as four pints a day with you...<br> - ...you'd still be sweating 10.<br> - We intend marching by night.<br> Fine, well, precisely in what direction?<br> - There are compasses, you know.<br> - That's fine.<br> That's just fine.<br> Someday I'll have you tell me...<br> ...what your compass was reading as<br> you passed the Jebel Haroudj Mountains.<br> They're mostly magnetic rock...<br> ...and that sort of makes nonsense<br> out of the compass.<br> - One can navigate by the stars.<br> - If you marched 106 miles by the stars...<br> ...and your calculations<br> were just one percent out...<br> ...you could pass the Eiffel Tower<br> in daylight and never see it.<br> Look where Marada is.<br> There's absolutely n-n-noth...<br> - Nothing.<br> - Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.<br> If you miss this glorious<br> little bunch of trees...<br> ...there's n-nothing between you<br> and the coast, and that's 500 miles.<br> Well, nobody's suggesting<br> that it was easy, Mr. Moran.<br> Tell me this, captain,<br> are you right-handed?<br> - Yes, as a matter of fact.<br> - That means your right leg...<br> ...is more developed than the other<br> and takes a longer step.<br> If you have an unreliable compass,<br> you just go around...<br> ...in a left-handed circle<br> and there's nothing you can do about it.<br> You're right, Mr. Towns, but you're<br> talking about right-handed civilians.<br> In an officer's training corps...<br> ...we military men are taught to march<br> with absolute precision.<br> I'd even send Sergeant Watson<br> here on ahead.<br> As it happens, he's left-handed.<br> Now, if you'll excuse me.<br> Come along, sergeant.<br> There's nothing you can do, Frank.<br> He goes by the book.<br> And you can't re-write it for him.<br> No.<br> Gentlemen.<br> I've been examining this aeroplane.<br> - You have?<br> - Yes. We have everything here...<br> ...that we need to build a new one<br> and fly it out.<br> If you'd have a look<br> at my calculations.<br> - Don't know if you can read my writing.<br> - Are you trying to be funny?<br> - What did you say?<br> - I said, are you trying to be funny?<br> That is precisely the reaction<br> I'd expect from a man...<br> ...of your obvious limitations.<br> What's happening to everybody?<br> Here. Here, you can have this.<br> And here you are, Ratbags.<br> I won't be needing this anymore.<br> I won't be needing this either.<br> Hey, you don't have a coat, do you?<br> Take mine. I won't be<br> needing it anymore.<br> - I don't think I should.<br> - What's wrong? That's a good coat.<br> It cost me 50 bucks in Marseilles.<br> It'd cost more than 100 in the States.<br> - If you really want me to...<br> - Oh, sure.<br> I gave the radio to the boy.<br> I won't be needing it anymore.<br> I'm going with Captain Harris.<br> I got something for you fellas too.<br> I got a lot of work shirts<br> I picked up cheap in Genoa.<br> They're good shirts.<br> I only washed them once.<br> Harris, don't you know better<br> than to tell Cobb he could go with you?<br> How far do you...? The man's crazy.<br> He wouldn't last a day out there.<br> - Cobb? I haven't even spoken to him.<br> - He seems to think he's going with you.<br> Does he? Well, I'll have<br> to disillusion him.<br> No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> Just let it alone for a while.<br> Incidentally, I appreciate<br> your concern about me going...<br> ...but I want you to know<br> I'm doing it all off my own bat.<br> It may be a gamble, but it can increase<br> your chances of being picked up.<br> Come on, sergeant.<br> - What's happened?<br> - Must have twisted it.<br> All right, let's get him over here.<br> Just tripped in the doorway, sir.<br> Must have caught it on something.<br> It seems there is nothing broken.<br> Perhaps you just sprained it.<br> Sorry we have no ice.<br> Looks as if you're for<br> the Sick Parade, sergeant.<br> Just my luck, sir.<br> I suppose I'd only be a burden to you.<br> - Well, it can't be helped now.<br> - Perhaps, if I could rest it tonight...<br> - ...I'd be all right tomorrow.<br> - I'm afraid we haven't time.<br> Don't you worry about it, sergeant.<br> Yes, sir.<br> What do you mean? You don't think<br> you're going out there on your own?<br> Oh, no. No, he's not.<br> He's not gonna go alone.<br> - I'm going with him. Isn't that right?<br> - I'm afraid not, old chap.<br> But I just told you.<br> I just told you I was going.<br> You're in no condition<br> to come with me.<br> Sorry, but I think it's better<br> that you stay here.<br> Why, I told you I was going!<br> I told you! I told you!<br> - Take it easy, Cobb. Come on.<br> - I told you!<br> - Let me go!<br> - Easy, Cobb.<br> - Let me go!<br> - Easy, Cobb, easy. Easy.<br> We don't want to hurt you.<br> I told you!<br> We'll all end up like him, I'm betting.<br> Leave him now, captain.<br> I'll talk to him later.<br> Here.<br> Thank you.<br> - That an oil journal you're reading?<br> - No.<br> You're not in this line, then.<br> Line?<br> Well, yes. I mean drilling. Oil.<br> No, I'm a designer.<br> Oh, really? What, furniture,<br> that sort of thing?<br> No, Mr. Moran, aeroplanes.<br> I'm an aircraft designer.<br> Are you?<br> Then you really meant what you said<br> about getting this thing out of here.<br> Did you think I was joking, perhaps?<br> No, Mr. Dorfmann, that I didn't think.<br> You always have to spoil things<br> for me, don't you?<br> What did you have to tell the captain<br> I couldn't go along for?<br> - I didn't tell the captain anything.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, you're the one had me fired<br> in Jebel, though, wasn't it?<br> Chief rigger, in charge of seven guys.<br> You think I couldn't handle<br> a crummy job like that?<br> All I had to do was hold onto<br> this lousy job for another six months.<br> I could have gone back<br> to the States as a chief.<br> But, no. Oh, no.<br> You had to spoil it for me.<br> - Well, you still could go back.<br> - Yeah, to what?<br> They ain't gonna let no headcase<br> run a drilling operation.<br> Nobody's describing you<br> as a headcase, Mr. Cobb.<br> That's what I came to tell you.<br> Now, you really must try<br> to understand that fatigue mentale...<br> ...I mean, mental exhaustion...<br> ...can happen to anyone.<br> But it doesn't last.<br> Well, I don't understand<br> all those fancy words.<br> I don't think those guys<br> that do the hiring do either.<br> Possibly not, but it will pass.<br> It will pass, I assure you.<br> I tell you now, mate,<br> we're better off right here...<br> ...than traipsing<br> off on that bloody desert.<br> Do you think you can look<br> after Chucho?<br> I'm gonna go along<br> with Captain Harris.<br> - Well, well, yeah. But...<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> I thought you were saving him<br> for some snotty-nosed Mexican kid.<br> Sure, but don't be jealous, Ratbags.<br> Maybe one day I find<br> a present for you too.<br> What's this "jaloose"?<br> Can't you learn to speak English?<br> Hey, why would you want<br> to go walking off into that?<br> - Didn't you see enough of that in Jebel?<br> - Who knows, Mike?<br> Maybe after a few days walking<br> we'll be better off than you are.<br> It's all right, Chucho.<br> It's all right, Chucho.<br> - I will be back. It's all right, Chucho.<br> - Easy, easy, easy.<br> You must be bloody daft, mate.<br> Anyway, maybe Capitn Harris<br> can teach me to speak...<br> ...real good English<br> like you, my little Ratbags.<br> Stupid sod.<br> Thank you.<br> - Good, you all set?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Welcome aboard.<br> I'm not as confident<br> that we won't make it as you...<br> ...but I'd be grateful if you'd send up<br> some smoke at midday...<br> ...for three days.<br> To help keep our bearings.<br> - Three days?<br> - Yes, we won't need it after that.<br> Ah.<br> Well, captain, we all wish you every...<br> Well, you know how all of us feel so...<br> Yes, well, come along.<br> It will be getting dark soon.<br> We might get lost.<br> Hey, Babozo, slow down.<br> - Remember you got flat feet.<br> - Adis, little Ratbags.<br> He's gone! He's gone!<br> He's gone.<br> Cobb's gone.<br> I don't understand. Can they see<br> him from up there or can't they?<br> Of course not, he's just<br> looking at the view.<br> Haven't you been up there? Lovely.<br> There's a big lake on the other side.<br> They got speedboats, everything.<br> Frank, he's got six hours' start on you.<br> How far could he get without water?<br> He didn't even stop to take<br> a canteen. And it's my fault.<br> - I should have watched him.<br> - Even if you find him, what can you do?<br> What can we do? You'll be just<br> as badly off as Harris would be.<br> I'm gonna bring him back, Lew.<br> You will see we have all we need:<br> Welding torches, steel cable,<br> all the tools we need.<br> For example, this here,<br> it all looks quite adequate.<br> - Why were they being returned?<br> - You know what engineers are like.<br> They just love shiny new tools, especially<br> if someone else is paying for them.<br> The prototype I have in mind would<br> have to fly at the first attempt.<br> To achieve that, Mr. Moran, requires<br> a pilot of quite outstanding capabilities.<br> Granted, this may not be the best<br> possible advertisement...<br> ...but Frank Towns is one of the few<br> really great pilots left in this world.<br> - Oh, really?<br> - Yes, oh, really!<br> He flew in planes that were n-nothing<br> more than bits and pieces...<br> ...before you went to school.<br> That's what is wrong. He's remembered<br> everything and learned nothing.<br> However, since he apparently finds it<br> necessary to run off into the desert...<br> ...in pursuit of a lunatic who could be<br> of no practical value to this project...<br> ...the question is entirely academic.<br> Don't you think so, Mr. Moran?<br> I agree. Entirely academic.<br> Get away! Get out of here!<br> Get out of here!<br> Get out! Get out!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - It's three minutes after 12.<br> Don't you want to start<br> the signals for Captain Harris?<br> And your Captain Towns?<br> Get out if it, you stinker!<br> It's Frank!<br> - Hey, skipper!<br> - Someone get some water.<br> I'll get it.<br> Frank!<br> What happened to Cobb?<br> You all right?<br> We're stuck here, Lew.<br> You know that, don't you?<br> Frank, I talked to Dorfmann again.<br> L... l...<br> I realize that he... That he,<br> you know, irritates you.<br> But I do think he knows more<br> than we give him credit for.<br> Well, what's he dreamed up now?<br> Well, maybe he hasn't a leg to stand on,<br> I don't kn-kn-know.<br> But you're the only person<br> who's qualified to tell him so...<br> ...and all I'm asking you<br> to do is to... Is to talk to him.<br> Well, just talk to him.<br> All right, I'll talk to him, Lew.<br> If it makes you happy, I'll talk to him.<br> There's no component problem.<br> The port boom is undamaged and<br> so are all the portside components.<br> If we remove the starboard wing<br> and attach it to the port boom...<br> ...and perform a similar operation<br> on the tail plane...<br> ...you'll see that we'll have<br> the basis of an entirely new...<br> ...and aerodynamically sound structure.<br> - Is that understood?<br> - Oh, absolutely.<br> We need only to clear the port engine<br> of the sand that choked it in flight.<br> The Coffman starter is serviceable...<br> ...and we should have no difficulty<br> starting up the engine.<br> If we don't waste too much fuel<br> on signals to Captain Harris...<br> ...who's unlikely to be in any condition<br> to benefit from them...<br> ...we shall have enough of that as well.<br> Most of the hydraulic fluid<br> has leaked away...<br> ...but I worked out direct rod and<br> cable controls, so that is no problem.<br> All right, now, what are you going<br> to use for an undercarriage?<br> Our last landing rendered<br> the undercarriage unserviceable.<br> There is enough H-section<br> in the cargo monorail...<br> ...and hull longerons to make up<br> the skid cradle for takeoff.<br> Skid cradle?<br> Well, skis, Mr. Moran. Skis.<br> To take off, we shall have<br> to move the final structure...<br> ...to the valley beyond that far dune.<br> The surface there should be adequate.<br> Now, as to whether it will fly...<br> ...as far as the general design factors<br> are concerned, there are no problems.<br> The center of gravity will allow us<br> to distribute the payload...<br> ...that means ourselves, on both wings.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> Are you suggesting we string people<br> on top of that wing...<br> ...like sacks of potatoes?<br> They'll be behind fairings.<br> Never mind fairings!<br> We got an injured man in there.<br> The doctor says<br> he can't even be moved.<br> You're suggesting we tack<br> him onto this thing...<br> ...and bounce him around<br> like a wrangler in a rodeo?<br> That is not what I had in mind,<br> Mr. Towns.<br> With the material<br> and personnel available...<br> ...this project would require<br> at least 12 days.<br> How long did you say Mr. Scarnati<br> might be expected to live? Six days?<br> Perhaps less.<br> See, the problem does not even arise.<br> Mr. Scarnati will remain here.<br> Why, you really are a miserable...<br> Even with the men, the wing loading<br> will be half that of the sky truck.<br> We shall leave the hull, starboard boom,<br> undercarriage, chanson on the ground.<br> Now, any more questions?<br> Yeah! Yeah, I have a few.<br> Now, let's see if I've got this straight.<br> You're gonna unzip that starboard wing,<br> lift it up from the other side...<br> ...and tag it onto this port boom.<br> Is that correct?<br> Well, yes. The tapers<br> will be the wrong way, but...<br> The tapers? Forget about the tapers!<br> You know what that wing weighs?<br> I would estimate it at something<br> just over a ton.<br> That's just about right.<br> There are eight of us.<br> Do you think you can lift<br> We use wedges and levers.<br> There is also a winch<br> and we can construct an A-frame.<br> All right, we'll have levers and wedges<br> and we'll throw in a winch.<br> This bunch is living on pressed dates<br> with a sip of water once in a while.<br> In a couple days, nobody's gonna have<br> the strength to do anything around here.<br> That is a very good point.<br> The heavy work will be done first.<br> The wing will be moved tonight.<br> - Tonight?<br> - Yes, I've worked out...<br> ...a simple winding gear for use<br> with the starboard generator...<br> ...which will keep the batteries charged<br> and provide lighting.<br> I see no immediate problems.<br> Unless you have some more questions,<br> I still have some calculations to make.<br> I thought it was all cut and dried.<br> You mean you have a few things<br> you haven't figured out yet?<br> Well, naturally I discontinued<br> my work...<br> ...when you embarked<br> on your romantic search for Mr. Cobb.<br> We do need a pilot on this project...<br> ...and frankly, I considered your chances<br> of survival quite remote.<br> However, now that you are with us<br> again, I can complete my calculations.<br> - I see no insoluble problems.<br> - Well, I'll give you one.<br> You say building this thing of yours<br> will take 12 days. Well, that's just fine.<br> If we're real lucky, we just have<br> enough water to last another 10.<br> We have several gallons<br> of antifreeze.<br> We can distill enough to provide<br> for another four or five days.<br> But I agree water will be<br> a critical factor.<br> Maybe we'll be dead before<br> you finish this and maybe we won't.<br> That's what you'd call a critical factor.<br> Let me tell you something<br> that makes nonsense out of this.<br> - Please do.<br> - I won't give you...<br> ...the old veteran flyer routine,<br> Mr. Dorfmann.<br> I just want you to know I've<br> been flying for quite some time...<br> ...and it hasn't always been<br> for crummy outfits like this one.<br> I'm sure you've had a colorful career.<br> But that's not the point.<br> All right, you know a whole lot more<br> than I do about aerodynamics...<br> ...and drag coefficients<br> and stress factors. Okay, okay.<br> Your theory's fine. But you get this: That<br> engine's rated at 2000 horsepower...<br> ...and if I was fool enough<br> to let it get started...<br> ...it'd shake your pile of junk<br> into 1000 pieces...<br> ...and cut us up into mincemeat<br> with the propeller.<br> I told you there'd be no difficulty<br> building this aeroplane.<br> I also told you it would require<br> an outstanding pilot to fly it.<br> The only thing outstanding about you,<br> Mr. Towns, is your stupidity!<br> - What did he expect?<br> - Shh.<br> - Easy, easy.<br> - What did you...?<br> You want me to throw<br> a conniption fit with his drawings?<br> Say he's a genius or something?<br> What good would that do when<br> I know the damn thing could never fly?<br> Excuse me, captain, but perhaps...<br> Perhaps there is one other thing.<br> The way it is now, some of these men<br> may not last as long as the water.<br> But they need to believe<br> that there is hope for them.<br> I don't know, Mr. Towns,<br> but maybe to build a thing like this...<br> ...could be a lot of help.<br> We prove it can't fly<br> and get killed in the process?<br> What're you giving us, doc?<br> This is hard work.<br> These men can't stand hard work.<br> Watching each other die<br> could be even harder.<br> I've lost five men, Lew.<br> Gabriele in there, he's on the way.<br> That'll be six.<br> Are you...? Are you asking me<br> to kill the rest of them...<br> ...trying to get a deathtrap<br> off the ground?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know, Lew. It won't work.<br> It just can't work.<br> All right, maybe it can't.<br> Maybe it can't and we'll all be killed.<br> But if there's just one chance in<br> a thousand that he has got something...<br> ...boy, I'd rather take it than just<br> sit around here waiting to die.<br> You there, Mr. Crow.<br> We'll need those panels again.<br> You must be more careful.<br> All right, Heinrich, I'll watch it.<br> Oh, he's a lovely little fella,<br> a little ray of sunshine.<br> A slow, steady turn<br> is quite sufficient.<br> You'll be relieved in about half an hour.<br> Don't let that needle drop below 80.<br> That one there.<br> - Eighty, huh?<br> - That's right.<br> Now, we pull on three.<br> One, two, three.<br> Shift, you wee mother...<br> Hey, Bellamy!<br> You big horse! Come on up here<br> and give me a hand.<br> Hang on, little Ratbags. I'm coming.<br> My hand's tough enough.<br> You want me to leave this<br> in place, Frank?<br> Ask Mr. Dorfmann.<br> Leave both of the bolts in place until<br> the trestle is ready to take the weight.<br> As soon as you have finished that...<br> Mr. Moran, once you have<br> finished that...<br> ...come to the tail end.<br> I'll mark out the assembly for you.<br> Hey. Hey. Hey, what are you<br> building, sandcastles?<br> Hashish, huh?<br> Hubbly-bubbly. Hubbly-bubbly.<br> What's it for? Come on.<br> I'm constructing a still.<br> The sand will prevent the tube<br> from fracturing when I bend it.<br> That's very cunning.<br> Sometimes I wonder how you chaps<br> never won the war.<br> - War?<br> - You know:<br> I wasn't involved.<br> That's it, then.<br> That's why they never won.<br> They didn't have old Heinrich.<br> Oh, no, no! No, no! We<br> won't need that second winch now.<br> Go around and get that cable<br> over the apron.<br> We've got enough rope?<br> Go on! Don't keep Uncle Heinrich<br> waiting.<br> Double up. Double, double, double.<br> Mr. Watson?<br> Don't forget, save those bolts.<br> Very good.<br> We need a spanner.<br> Have you got a 3/8 spanner, darling?<br> Thank you, dear. Give us<br> a big, wet kiss, will you?<br> Look, knock it off, mate.<br> All right, everything's set.<br> Easy, now.<br> There, that's it.<br> Come on. Come on,<br> that's it. Watch your step.<br> Are we ready, Mr. Towns?<br> Yeah, I guess so.<br> All right.<br> Let's commence. Now!<br> Keep the pressure up. That's it.<br> Come on, come on. Come on, now.<br> All right, a little slower.<br> Easy, now.<br> Don't let her loosen up!<br> Easy. Come on, pull harder, come on.<br> Hold it. Hold it there!<br> Enough!<br> Stop.<br> Oh, Lord, I'm tired.<br> Harris!<br> Harris!<br> Well, sergeant...<br> You've been holding the fort?<br> Yes, sir.<br> This is full of sand.<br> Clean it out for me like a good chap?<br> Yes, sir.<br> We've worked at it two nights now...<br> ...but Dorfmann 's brainchild looks<br> less like an airplane...<br> ...than it did when we started.<br> It's almost midday<br> and he's still working.<br> He's right about one thing, though.<br> The little men with the slide rules and<br> computers are going to inherit the Earth.<br> And it's kind of sad that Dorfmann<br> won't be there to see it.<br> But then, I guess he<br> doesn't need to see it.<br> He already knows it.<br> Here. Here, is that any better?<br> I'll try it.<br> Mr. Standish...<br> ...you can continue<br> with the cutting of the tail surfaces.<br> The tools are still in the hull.<br> Hey, Standish! Watch your diet.<br> You don't have to eat all those dates.<br> Save some for the scum up here.<br> Your wife's a lovely girl.<br> She died.<br> But you can't know that.<br> You there, we need help<br> with the welding.<br> All right. We're coming, men.<br> It's getting cold up here, anyway.<br> Sisters of mercy!<br> Your brother will play the violin again.<br> Did you...? Did you say something<br> to Captain Harris?<br> Now, what would I have said<br> to Captain Harris?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> He's acting very funny.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> In here!<br> In here!<br> Here.<br> We are ready to proceed.<br> Come along. It is quite essential<br> to maintain our schedule.<br> Oh, I reckon we've been flogging<br> a dead horse long enough.<br> Well, of course you're right.<br> But couldn't we just rest<br> for another hour and then...<br> Absolutely not.<br> - Come on, let's get...<br> - Before we start talking...<br> ...about who's gonna work<br> and when, let me tell you something.<br> Somebody's been stealing water<br> out of this tank.<br> Stealing the water? What do you mean?<br> Who in the hell would do<br> a thing like that? Skipper, you sure?<br> Damn! How much is gone?<br> I starting checking on it<br> yesterday. How do you like that?<br> Now, I don't even want to know<br> who it is, but I'm telling you this.<br> If it happens again and I see<br> who's doing it, I'll kill him.<br> It was me.<br> It was you?!<br> Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!<br> You... You bloody fool.<br> In any case, I didn't steal it.<br> I took it.<br> You took it?<br> The people here could die for lack<br> of water and you took it?<br> Yes.<br> Because whilst you have been sleeping<br> or pursuing your ridiculous interests...<br> ...I have been working.<br> Since I was working harder<br> than you were...<br> ...I also needed more water<br> than you did.<br> However, it won't happen again.<br> Because from now on<br> we shall all work equally hard.<br> - Is it clear now?<br> - No, it isn't.<br> But maybe I'm an idiot.<br> Maybe you'll have to explain it to me.<br> If you think being a boy wonder<br> entitles you to other people's water...<br> ...you've got another thing coming.<br> Why did you have to steal it?<br> Why didn't you just come<br> and ask me for it?<br> Because you wouldn't have<br> given me any.<br> You're damn right I wouldn't!<br> Listen, if you're coming here<br> to tell me I shouldn't be unkind...<br> ...to that miserable Kraut,<br> you're wasting your breath.<br> Now, don't tell me<br> you don't think he's crazy.<br> Well, suppose we agree<br> he's as mad as a hatter.<br> Do you think the rest of us aren't?<br> Do you think you've been<br> behaving rationally?<br> - Do you really think anyone would?<br> - All right, maybe not.<br> He isn't concerned about<br> getting out of here.<br> All he wants is<br> to see that thing fly.<br> He doesn't care who gets killed<br> in the process.<br> - Well, now...<br> - Well, nothing!<br> I've done my share of killing.<br> My score is five. What does<br> he want to do, improve on that?<br> - Back to that, are we?<br> - Yes...<br> I don't believe you're really<br> that concerned about those five men.<br> - No, I'm laughing myself sick.<br> - You're not laughing either.<br> What really gets you<br> is that maybe you're wrong.<br> And maybe that little dried-up<br> calculating machine down there...<br> ...really does kn-know the answers.<br> Maybe Frank Towns, who's flown<br> every crate they've built...<br> ...who could fly in and out<br> of a tennis court if he had to...<br> ...maybe that great trailblazer's<br> nothing more than a back number now.<br> And maybe men like Dorfmann<br> can build machines...<br> ...that can do Frank Towns' job for him.<br> And do it better.<br> You're getting to be quite a philosopher,<br> aren't you?<br> All right.<br> Let's suppose you have killed five men.<br> If it gives you any satisfaction<br> to sit here feeling sorry for yourself...<br> ...well, that's your... That's fine!<br> But if you really mean it's your fault...<br> ...it's up to you to get us out of here,<br> isn't it?<br> And if you're not too proud<br> to talk to Dorfmann...<br> ...and you're half the pilot<br> you think you are, well, maybe you will!<br> "If"! All right.<br> If you hadn't been such a drunk...<br> ...you might not have been a second-rate<br> navigator in a fifth-rate outfit.<br> If you hadn't stayed in your bunk<br> to kill that last bottle...<br> ...you might have checked the engineer's<br> report. We might not be here.<br> All right?<br> Oh, Lew, I...<br> Oh, Lew.<br> Why the hell isn't anyone<br> on the generator?<br> What's the point?<br> Come on, you drunken bum.<br> Let's get back to work.<br> Don't worry. It'll be cut in time.<br> Think the Wright Brothers<br> would approve?<br> I can't see why not.<br> It's all free and clear up here, Heinrich.<br> What's the drill, Mr. Dorfmann?<br> - You're not yet ready for heavy work.<br> - I'd like to do something.<br> We could use<br> Dr. Renaud down here.<br> Perhaps you could relieve him<br> at the generator.<br> Now, how about that?<br> Heinrich Schweitzer.<br> It's all set.<br> I think we are read...<br> I think we are ready to proceed.<br> All right? Go!<br> We did it!<br> Are we all ready?<br> Let's go!<br> Hold it, stop!<br> - All right.<br> - Well done, Watson.<br> All right, now, everybody pull together.<br> Keep pulling. Keep going.<br> Keep pulling, boys.<br> Coming fine now. Keep it going.<br> Keep it going. That's it.<br> Don't let up with the slack.<br> Now, it's coming fine. Just fine.<br> Hold it!<br> Hold it!<br> Take it easy.<br> It's nearly there. Nearly.<br> Hold it!<br> I've got a story for the<br> Daily Mirror when I get back.<br> "How I stopped smoking<br> in three days."<br> Here, hold this.<br> You've done a wonderful job, Heinrich.<br> But will it fly?<br> Oh, come on, will you? Let's finish it.<br> It's all set up there.<br> You know, it's really<br> beginning to look like something.<br> Don't worry, Mr. Towns.<br> Helicopters don't look very elegant<br> either, but they fly reasonably well.<br> Really looks pretty good.<br> You suppose if we get out of here<br> we're gonna have extra leave coming?<br> From Arabco Oil?<br> We'll be lucky they don't take this<br> off our two months.<br> Tell you what though,<br> if ever we do get out of here alive...<br> ...and I get my leave,<br> I'm going to stay put in Benghazi.<br> And fix myself up<br> with one of them Arab bints.<br> That's not all you'll fix yourself up with<br> in Benghazi. I've been there, mate.<br> Now, Australia.<br> This place I was at last year,<br> there's this bint.<br> Farida or something.<br> She did a sort of a dance.<br> You should have seen it.<br> I've woken up a few nights in a cold<br> sweat thinking about it, I can tell you.<br> Probably some poxed-up old bag<br> from Manchester.<br> Is this right?<br> What's the point of that?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I just thought I'd give it a name.<br> What sort of a name<br> is that supposed to be?<br> It's a bird.<br> The phoenix was a mythical bird<br> that burnt itself to ashes and rose...<br> I'm not bloody stupid, you know.<br> What's the matter, captain?<br> Smell the sea?<br> He's staggering around Benghazi,<br> you know, with this ugly, ugly broad.<br> Boxed out of his mind with Kickapoo<br> joy juice...<br> ...or hashish or something or other.<br> I've never seen anyone...<br> Kickapoo joy juice.<br> Shh. Hey! Hey! Hey! Shh!<br> What's wrong with him?<br> Get Mr. Towns.<br> Eleven... I count 12.<br> - They are way off any route.<br> - Yes.<br> Probably a razzia raiding party.<br> Better go and tell the men.<br> We don't want to rush into anything.<br> - Tell Mr. Towns to come up here.<br> - I already have.<br> There! Up there!<br> Arabs.<br> I'm sorry. That's all I know.<br> But I don't get it. They've got camels.<br> They could take us out of here.<br> If they are a raiding party,<br> they're outcasts from their own tribe...<br> ...and so far beyond the law<br> that killing a few people like us...<br> ...wouldn't mean a thing.<br> They are, in all probability, lost.<br> And just as short of water as we are.<br> They can only cause difficulties.<br> If we leave them alone they'll move on<br> and we can get back to work.<br> But why don't we just talk to them?<br> We can do that, can't we?<br> - They sound friendly enough.<br> - I wouldn't count on it.<br> No.<br> - But we have to find out.<br> - This time I'll go with you.<br> They're staying put.<br> Now, I'll take Sgt. Watson with me<br> and we'll go and tell...<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> I've already told you I'd be going.<br> What's the sense building this<br> if you're not here to drive?<br> - He's right, Frank.<br> - Nobody's going to drive this fool thing.<br> What?<br> Don't let's have an argument.<br> It's sublimely unimportant who goes out.<br> The sergeant and I have the best chance.<br> At first we'll say<br> there's only two of us.<br> We'll approach them in a circle<br> so if they prove to be unfriendly...<br> ...they won't double back and find you.<br> I think the uniform might do the trick.<br> - Where's the sergeant?<br> - In the hull.<br> Right.<br> Makes sense, Frank.<br> Here you are, sergeant. Ready?<br> - What's the trouble, sergeant?<br> - Nothing. No trouble, sir.<br> Come along, then.<br> I'm not going.<br> - What was that?<br> - I'm not going!<br> Sergeant, I don't think<br> you've quite understood.<br> I'm giving you an order<br> to come with me.<br> Now, look here, old chap.<br> There's only water for three days.<br> This thing they're building won't work.<br> It's up to us to go to those Arabs<br> and get them to help us.<br> Nothing to be afraid of.<br> I'm not afraid, Mr. Harris.<br> Sergeant, I'm going to repeat my order.<br> If you refuse it...<br> ...I'll assume you're willfully disobeying<br> a superior officer. Is that understood?<br> Don't let yourself down, Watson.<br> Report for duty and come with me.<br> You leave me no alternative but to place<br> you under arrest. Give me that revolver.<br> - No.<br> - You refuse?<br> Very well, sergeant.<br> Mr. Towns, I am going out on my own.<br> Now, I'd suggest that you<br> don't light any fires...<br> ...and maintain absolute silence<br> until I report back.<br> I'll keep them quiet.<br> There won't be any lights.<br> - Right.<br> - I believe I go along with you.<br> - Thank you. That's not necessary.<br> - Perhaps not...<br> ...but I do speak a little Arabic.<br> Do you?<br> Well, not enough,<br> but these fellows will understand.<br> Well, maybe not as much<br> as you might suppose.<br> Anyway, I'd like to go with you.<br> I'm gonna wait another half-hour,<br> then I'm gonna go look.<br> - We can't just sit here.<br> - Look, Frank, Harris is n-no fool.<br> He may be a bit excessively British,<br> but he's no fool.<br> If those people can be induced<br> to help us, Harris will do it.<br> If the situation is a bit tricky<br> down there...<br> ...and he's told them<br> there are just the two of them...<br> ...he can't suddenly announce<br> there are seven more of us.<br> And if you and I go barging in<br> that'll really put the lid on it.<br> Yeah, maybe you're right.<br> I doubt it all the time.<br> Hey!<br> Captain Towns! Captain Towns!<br> They've gone!<br> They've taken our fellows,<br> but they left a camel or something.<br> I can't see properly up there.<br> Frank, there's no...<br> Come on, Lew, we'd better have a look.<br> Camel's lame.<br> That's why they left it, it's lame.<br> Give me the...<br> He's dead, isn't he?<br> Mr. Towns and<br> I will be in the fuselage itself.<br> The heaviest men will need to be<br> inboard...<br> ...the lighter men outside.<br> They'll lie flat...<br> ...holding onto the ribs<br> of the windscreen.<br> We testing this engine today?<br> Mr. Dorfmann,<br> it's time we tested this engine.<br> - I think you can leave things to me.<br> - No, wait. Wait a minute.<br> I'm not forgetting you're the designer,<br> but if you want me to fly this thing...<br> This thing. This thing has a name.<br> - It's called an aeroplane.<br> - All right, it's an aeroplane.<br> I'd have a lot more respect for it<br> if I knew the engine worked.<br> The engine was running perfectly...<br> ...until the sand blocked<br> the carburetor jets in flight.<br> There is no reason why<br> it shouldn't run as it did before.<br> Unless you haven't cleaned the jets<br> properly...<br> ...in which case I'd advise you<br> to do it again.<br> Now listen, those sand screens are clear.<br> I've checked everything<br> under that cowling pretty thoroughly.<br> And if I'm to fly this machine<br> I'm gonna test run that engine today.<br> If we'd start this engine now...<br> ...the vibration will put unnecessary<br> strain on the whole structure.<br> Furthermore, there are only<br> seven cartridges in the Coffman starter.<br> It could take four or five<br> to start the engine...<br> ...leaving us only with two or three<br> when we are ready to depart.<br> I imagine even you will understand that<br> once we have used all seven cartridges...<br> ...we have no further means<br> of starting this engine.<br> Any doubt about starting this engine,<br> now is the time to find out.<br> Mr. Towns.<br> You behave as if stupidity were a virtue.<br> Why is that?<br> Lew, I'm gonna run up this engine.<br> A couple of you guys come up<br> and pull this prop through.<br> And that's an order.<br> No, you're not!<br> There's no point in going over it<br> all again.<br> Look, I've got them working<br> on the fairings...<br> ...but we need you<br> for the control groupings.<br> There's nothing down on paper.<br> It's all in your head.<br> I'd hate to spoil the job<br> after all the work you've put in.<br> I know it's difficult for you<br> to get on with Frank Towns.<br> But you've got to understand.<br> He need...<br> He needs to feel he's doing something.<br> You don't leave him anything.<br> Do you want yours n-now?<br> Uh-huh.<br> - You ought to come in, it's freezing out.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, now I've really balled things up,<br> haven't I?<br> - Dorfmann?<br> - Yeah. I've been thinking about this.<br> And I guess old Frank Towns just never<br> could stand being told what to do.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> You know, funny thing.<br> He was right about the engine too.<br> I guess I just wanted to make a point.<br> That's what really gets you about him,<br> he...<br> He always has to be right.<br> - You coming in?<br> - In a few minutes.<br> What else do you want me to say?<br> Nothing.<br> Leave me alone.<br> Tomorrow's the last day.<br> Then there'll only be what we get<br> from the still.<br> And that's not enough<br> to keep us all going.<br> Do you want them to fight over<br> the water? Is that what you want?<br> If we don't go back to work<br> we're going to die. All of us.<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, for God's sake, man...<br> - ...you're not a child, are you?<br> - Go away.<br> You told Towns he was behaving<br> as if stupidity was a virtue.<br> If he's making it into a virtue,<br> you're making it into a bloody science!<br> Ah, uh...<br> Lord Muck's woke up.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> No, I want to talk to all of you.<br> Mr. Towns, who is in authority here?<br> You are.<br> Very well, then.<br> Since I am in authority...<br> ...I have decided to finish this plane<br> and make it fly.<br> We shall now go back to work.<br> Hallelujah.<br> The fairings are about ready...<br> ...but you'll need to look<br> at the control linkages.<br> I'll be with you right after this here.<br> Well, is this the outfit you work for?<br> Becker Flugzeuge, yes.<br> I think I've heard of them.<br> Build all kinds of models?<br> Don't they build model planes?<br> The best.<br> I didn't know they produced<br> the big stuff too.<br> Well, the biggest we make is the Adler.<br> I think you'll find it on page 23.<br> The Adler has a two-meter wingspan.<br> But it's not one of my designs,<br> because it's a glider...<br> ...and I work only on the power models.<br> Page 23?<br> Yes, I think it's 23.<br> What about the big stuff?<br> Is it a different department or what?<br> The biggest I've personally designed<br> is the Jaeger 250.<br> Could I have this a moment, please?<br> Thank you.<br> Wait, it's here. There it is.<br> Jaeger 250.<br> It won the prize for extended flight<br> at Frankfurt last year.<br> Extended... Extended flight?<br> Yes. The radio control also<br> is my design...<br> ...and then on the opposite page there<br> there's another rather fine model.<br> It's called the Schwalbe. Right there.<br> Yes, yes, but I think what<br> Mr. Towns meant was the real thing.<br> How much designing<br> have you done on the real thing?<br> The real thing?<br> Well, yes. You know, like this.<br> Oh, no, no, no. You misunderstand.<br> We make nothing<br> but model aeroplanes.<br> You mean you've never designed<br> a full-sized aeroplane?<br> Full-size? No.<br> But then, of course,<br> the principles are the same.<br> Well, yes, they would be, wouldn't they?<br> Well, of course one encounters<br> different problems...<br> ...but basically the principles<br> are the same.<br> I think I'd better check on<br> the control linkages.<br> He's crazy, Lew.<br> He builds toy aeroplanes.<br> He didn't even keep anything from us.<br> He really doesn't think<br> there's any difference.<br> Well, what are we going to tell<br> those guys out there? They...<br> What are we going to tell them, Lew?<br> Nothing.<br> We haven't enough water left...<br> ...to stay alive.<br> We can die here...<br> ...or we can die in that thing.<br> What's the matter?<br> Haven't you any curiosity left?<br> Wouldn't you like to know<br> how it feels to fly a toy aeroplane?<br> Now what's he up to?<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe we'd better<br> have a word with him...<br> ...about not saying anything<br> to the others.<br> I don't know why you keep<br> humoring him like that.<br> If the thing can't fly, it can't fly.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> Anything missing?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> I'm arranging the harness attachments.<br> You'll be lucky if these guys can walk<br> tomorrow, let alone pull this thing.<br> Nevertheless, it will have to be done.<br> The propeller itself<br> will provide the basic impetus.<br> The men will mainly be<br> to give it direction.<br> Well, why n-not n-now?<br> It's too dangerous in the dark.<br> Well, I think maybe you're right.<br> It's too risky.<br> Go on.<br> Oh, well, one other thing.<br> It might be better<br> not to mention to the others...<br> ...about being a toy plane designer.<br> Toy plane designer?<br> Lew and I feel it might upset them.<br> Mr. Tow...<br> Mr. Towns.<br> A toy plane is something you wind up...<br> ...and it rolls along the floor.<br> A model aeroplane<br> is something totally different.<br> Model aeroplanes<br> have been flying successfully...<br> ...more than 50 years before the Wright<br> Brothers ever got off the ground.<br> They were not toy planes.<br> - All right.<br> - I didn't know that, Frank, did you?<br> Nevertheless, it is a fact.<br> And there is something else<br> you should remember, Mr. Towns.<br> A model plane has to fly itself.<br> There is no pilot to correct the trim.<br> Therefore, a model plane<br> has to be designed...<br> ...for greater stability than what<br> you are pleased to call the real thing.<br> In 1851, Henson and Stringfellow<br> built a rubber-powered model...<br> ...that flew 600 meters<br> before encountering an obstruction.<br> Aerofoil surfaces, lift<br> and drag coefficients...<br> ...weight-thrust equations and<br> the whole pattern of modern aviation...<br> ...originates from right there.<br> Well, where is he?<br> I'll go and get him.<br> Here he is.<br> Our friend Dorfmann's a bit impatient.<br> In 1851, Henson and Stringfellow...<br> ...built a rubber-powered<br> m-model aircraft...<br> ...that flew 600 meters<br> before encountering an obstruction.<br> Did you kn-know that, M-Mr. Towns?<br> That's great.<br> No, not great, but significant.<br> You understand, those are<br> the only cartridges we have.<br> If you fail with them<br> my work has been wasted.<br> The moment the engine fires,<br> throttle back.<br> Too much unnecessary vibration<br> could shake the structure to pieces.<br> Vibration must be kept to a minimum.<br> Clear.<br> That's number one.<br> Two.<br> What's wrong?<br> There ain't nothing wrong<br> with that engine.<br> Maybe he ain't giving it enough juice.<br> Three.<br> But he should know, shouldn't he?<br> He does know.<br> Wait. Wait!<br> You're wasting the cartridges.<br> You have only three left.<br> I know that.<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm gonna use one cartridge, ignition off,<br> clean out the cylinders.<br> No!<br> What are you doing?<br> Stop! I forbid you!<br> I forbid you!<br> Do you hear me? I forbid you!<br> Come on, mate.<br> You'll make it.<br> Take it easy.<br> You bastard, Frank!<br> You bastard!<br> You made it!<br> Frank, you bastard!<br> Stop! Stop it!<br> Stop it!<br> Throttle back! I told you, stop it!<br> All right, Mr. Dorfmann, start pulling.<br> All aboard.<br> I can't. I can't.<br> You did good, skipper.<br> Give it some slack. Come on, move!<br> That's it. That's it.<br> Watch your step.<br> Go!<br> Go!<br> What the hell is that?<br> They ain't gonna try to land<br> that thing here, are they?<br> Boy, it sure as hell looks that way.<br> Look at it! Look at it! Just look at it!<br> I've never seen anything so beautiful.<br> Seventeen days without a drink.<br> Boy, I wouldn't have believed<br> just plain water could look so good.<br> You never know, Frank.<br> I might become an addict.<br> - It's beautiful!<br> - Where'd they come from?<br> Those guys are either drunk or crazy.<br> How far did you say<br> that Henson and Stringfellow flew...<br> ...that rubber-powered model<br> in 1851, Mr. Dorfmann?<br> Six hundred meters, Mr. Towns.<br> Is that meters or yards?<br> Meters, Mr. Towns, meters.<br>
