Flush.<br> Criminal Courts, pressroom.<br> No, Hildy Johnson isn't here.<br> Queen.<br> Oh, hello, Mr. Burns.<br> No, Hildy hasn't come in yet.<br> Sure thing, Mr. Burns, I'll tell<br> him the minute he shows up.<br> That's the third time<br> Walter Burns has called.<br> Where do you suppose Hildy is?<br> Probably had a big night<br> at Madame Chow's.<br> I hear she's got some new<br> broads in from San Francisco.<br> I could go for a little of that<br> sweet and sour pork right now.<br> Come on, cut the gab.<br> Jacks bet.<br> I check to the Chinese gourmet.<br> Two bits.<br> Call me a sucker.<br> El foldo.<br> This place smells<br> like the city dump.<br> How can you breathe in here?<br> Hey, Bensinger, any<br> news on the hanging?<br> Did you talk to the Sheriff?<br> Why don't you

a couple of minutes.<br> Bet a dime.<br> Now, this is what the condemned<br> man ordered for his final meal:<br> Shrimp cocktail with<br> Thousand Island dressing,<br> rare roast beef, Brussels sprouts,<br> apple pie a la mode, Ovaltine.<br> "For his last meal<br> Williams is getting<br> a 95-cent blue plate special from the<br> greasy spoon across the street."<br> "At 9:00 tonight, Williams

to tell that dumb son-of-a-bitch<br> bastard to get his ass over here?<br> Thank you.<br> Any luck?<br> I've tried every speakeasy,<br> every gamblin' joint.<br> I've tried the Turkish bath.<br> No Hildy.<br> Call the Sanitation Department,<br> maybe they've picked<br> him up in some gutter.<br> I guess I better check the<br> hospitals or the morgue.<br> Be just like that clown to die<br> on me on the eve of a hanging.<br> How about those headlines?<br> Which one do you like?<br> They all stink.<br> Trouble is, there's not much<br> you can do with a hanging.<br> Now, if we had the electric<br> chair in this state,<br> that's something you can<br> really sink your teeth into.<br> "Williams gets the hot seat!"<br> "Williams Fries."<br> "Williams Roasted Alive."<br> Step right up

Hildy.<br> Is it a holiday or something?<br> Hey, look at him.<br> Prince of Wales.<br> Congratulate me I'm in love<br> Where the hell have you been?<br> Well, let's see.<br> I had a haircut,<br> I got a manicure,<br> I did a little shoppin'.<br> Hi, Duffy.<br> Yeah.<br> What the hell are<br> you dressed up for?<br> You're not covering a polo match,<br> you're covering a hanging.<br> That's what I wanted<br> to talk to you about.<br> Tomorrow you and I are gonna<br> stand this town on its ear.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Every damn paper is gonna have the<br> same damn story on that execution.<br> But we're going to scoop them all.<br> Because you know<br> what goes in there?<br> A picture of Williams<br> swinging by the neck.<br> A picture? A photograph,<br> the first time anywhere.<br> Exclusive in the Examiner.<br> What are you talkin' about?<br> That's against the law.<br> You can't bring a camera in there.<br> Who's gonna know?<br> Here, I had this<br> specially rigged up.<br> You clip it to your ankle,<br> you run the tube up your pants leg.<br> Make a hole in your pocket.<br> The minute Williams drops<br> through that trap door<br> you lift your pants leg and<br> squeeze the bulb. Clever?<br> You sure come up with some doozies.<br> At 7:00, the guy kicks off,<br> at 7:03 you're out<br> of the jail yard,<br> there's an ambulance<br> waiting for you<br> with a darkroom and a<br> typewriter inside.<br> You take off with the sirens going.<br> While you're batting out the story,<br> they're developing the negative.<br> At 7:22, the picture<br> gets to the engraver,<br> and we start setting up your copy.<br> At 7:56, we re-plate<br> the front page.<br> At 8:12, the presses start rolling<br> and at 8:47, you're out in the<br> street with an extra. How's that?<br> Walter, you'll either get the Pulitzer<br> Prize or a year in the clink.<br> You and me both, we're<br> in this together.<br> Now, what I want is<br> about 1,200 words.<br> You know, lots of atmosphere.<br> With the cold, gray dawn,<br> and a voice from the death house<br> singing Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,<br> and the body twisting<br> slowly, slowly in the wind.<br> I don't have to tell you.<br> Anything else?<br> Yeah. We'll need some<br> last words from Williams<br> as he walks up those 13 steps.<br> Something with a punch to it.<br> If necessary make 'em up yourself.<br> Last words? You want<br> some last words?<br> I'll give you some<br> last words. I quit.<br> A guy about to be hung? No.<br> He wouldn't say that.<br> Not Williams, me. I quit.<br> What?<br> I'm resigning.<br> Effective immediately.<br> It's the Tribune, right?<br> They've been trying to<br> steal you for years.<br> I won't work for the Tribune...<br> Damn right.<br> Nobody walks out on Walter Burns.<br> Or any newspaper.<br> Walter, I'm getting married.<br> Getting married? What the hell for?<br> You've already been married.<br> Some marriage that was.<br> I never even got to Niagara Falls<br> 'cause you made me get off the<br> train to cover the torch murder.<br> That's what makes you a<br> first-class reporter.<br> You're always in the right<br> place at the right time.<br> But never at home, Walter. Not for<br> Christmas, not for our anniversary.<br> When she was sick in the<br> hospital and nearly died,<br> I was stuck in Tennessee covering<br> that goddamn Monkey Trial.<br> It's not gonna happen again,<br> Walter. Not this time.<br> Okay, Hildy.<br> You want to take<br> the plunge again, all right.<br> Tell you what we do.<br> First you cover the hanging,<br> then you can get married.<br> Take the whole weekend off.<br> Don't come into the office till Monday.<br> Monday I'll be in Philadelphia.<br> Philadelphia?<br> We're taking the midnight train,<br> tomorrow afternoon we get married<br> with her family and<br> everything and everybody.<br> Monday I start working for her<br> uncle in the advertising business.<br> The advertising business?<br> You heard me.

Could be some sort<br> of a Communist trick.<br> Oh, no. I was right there with<br> the Governor when he signed it.<br> Get the Governor on the phone.<br> Oh, you can't.<br> We can't?<br> He's gone fishing.<br> Just him, an Indian guide, and<br> a canoe. No phone, no nothin'.<br> He sure picked a hell<br> of a time to go fishing.<br> Excuse me.<br> Uh, just between us,<br> it's not really fishing.<br> Because that Indian<br> guide is really a girl.<br> She isn't even Indian.<br> She's from New Jersey.<br> Yes, Jacobi.<br> What? You do?<br> Are you sure? Herbie. Your Honor!<br> Hold on a minute.<br> It's Jacobi.

I don't know, Herbie.<br> What about that reprieve?<br> I-If it ever comes out.<br> Nobody reprieved that<br> policeman he shot.<br> There was no clemency, either.<br> Do what I tell you!<br> Jacobi, you there?<br> Listen. Shoot to kill!<br> You heard me.<br> Okay, okay, Sheriff.<br> Only, I thought you<br> wanted him alive.<br> Anything you say, Sheriff.<br> We know you're up there, Williams.<br> Now, this is your last chance.<br> Throw the gun out the window<br> and come out with your hands up.<br> Or we'll smoke you out.<br> New instructions.<br> No bullhorn, no tear gas.<br> We go in there,<br> and we go in shooting.<br> All set!<br> Let's go, men!<br> Give us a break, fellas,<br> we're Press.<br> Christ, we're gonna miss the<br> whole thing.

You know that.<br> I'd kill you if you ever<br> worked for anybody else.<br> Hear that, Peggy?<br> That's my diploma.<br> All aboard!<br> Wish I had time to get you<br> a wedding present. I know!<br> What?<br> Walter, I couldn't take it.<br> I insist.<br> It was a present from<br> the big chief himself.<br> And if you look on the inside<br> you'll find a little inscription:<br> "To the best newspaperman I know."<br> When you get to Philadelphia,<br> you can have my name scratched<br> out and put yours in its place.<br> You know I wouldn't do that.<br> Goodbye, Mr. Burns.<br> Best of luck, you love birds!<br> Goodbye, you big palooka.<br> That train that just left.<br> What's the first stop?<br> Gary, Indiana.<br> All right. Send a message to the<br> police chief of Gary, Indiana.<br> Tell them to meet the midnight<br> train to Philadelphia<br> and arrest one Hildy Johnson.<br> Hildy Johnson?<br> Yeah.<br> Son of a bitch stole my watch.<br>
