Summon the others.<br> Tell them to bring their babies.<br> They will not come for me, Father.<br> The men, yes.<br> The women... no.<br> Perhaps they will come for me.<br> (bell rings)<br> (bell continues ringing)<br> Maria Dolores, I baptise thee<br> in the name of the Father,<br> and of the Son,<br> and of the Holy Ghost.<br> Amen.<br> I baptise thee in the name of the Father,<br> and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.<br> Amen.<br> (funnel blasts)<br> (man) Attention!<br> Detail, dismount!<br> Dismiss!<br> Where's the chief of police?<br> I wouldn't know.<br> You, get out of here!<br> All right, bring these people in.<br> - Drunk and disorderly.<br> - Fine five pesos.<br> - Drunk and disorderly.<br> - Five pesos.<br> - Alcohol on his possession.<br> - 20 pesos.<br> - Drunk and disorderly.<br> - Five pesos.<br> But Your Excellency,<br> I have no money.<br> I am not "Your Excellency"!<br> Won't you people ever learn?<br> I'm an Indian like you are,<br> and like you.<br> And like you.<br> And I'm proud of it.<br> Stand up straight.<br> Let him work it off<br> cleaning out the cells.<br> Found wearing a holy medal<br> under his shirt.<br> - What of the rest?<br> - All drunk.<br> - Oh, dismiss them.<br> - All right. Come on, outside. Hurry up.<br> Everybody outside. Hurry up.<br> (cheering)<br> - Thank you for doing my work.<br> - Somebody's got to carry on.<br> Well, where were you?<br> With the governor.<br> - He's in splendid health.<br> - You don't look very happy.<br> The governor and I are friends.<br> We understand each other.<br> - He asked a few questions about you.<br> - About me? What about me?<br> Well, he had a copy of your report<br> on his desk.<br> - You know how he feels about the clergy.<br> - I feel exactly the same way.<br> We shot the last priest six months ago.<br> - The governor doesn't seem to think so.<br> - Well, he's wrong!<br> I tell you, the last priest<br> was shot six months ago.<br> Do you wish to argue<br> with the governor, my boy? That's stupid.<br> Remember, he gets information<br> we don't get.<br> - Oh, there's no doubt about it.<br> - What's the name of this priest?<br> What's his village? What's his parish?<br> Where was he born?<br> That's the trouble - nobody knows<br> anything when it comes to these traitors.<br> Nobody talks,<br> no one knows their name.<br> They go from village to village and the<br> people hide them, the superstitious fools.<br> They do anything to hide a priest.<br> How does he expect us to find a man<br> when we haven't got a photograph?<br> This time, the governor says we have.<br> You can tell he's a priest<br> by the collar, that's all.<br> Not a good picture,<br> but it's the best we've got.<br> They all look alike to me.<br> I've shot him a dozen times.<br> (chief) The governor says we must<br> have this priest before the rains come.<br> I know how to get this man<br> before the rains come.<br> You know what I'd do?<br> Take hostages.<br> Take a hostage from every village.<br> Then if the people don't report him,<br> if they don't turn him in,<br> shoot the hostages,<br> then take more.<br> It'll cost lives, yes. But we've got to drive<br> these people out of the country.<br> (guitar plays)<br> (man sings)<br> (shouts instructions)<br> (men whoop)<br> (woman screams)<br> (laughs)<br> (baby cries)<br> What are you doing here?<br> Why did you leave your village?<br> My father made me leave.<br> After you left.<br> I meant to come back.<br> I had work to do.<br> We're making a better world,<br> Maria Dolores. For him too.<br> It's a girl, like me.<br> - What's her name?<br> - My name - Maria Dolores.<br> How do you live?<br> Do you work?<br> I work in the canteen.<br> Oh, Lieutenant.<br> Hey, you, what are you doing here?<br> Get out!<br> (baby cries)<br> I've got 'em all corralled in the plaza.<br> Are you the head man of the village?<br> S, seor.<br> You know what we're here for, don't you?<br> We're looking for the priest.<br> You know what a priest is?<br> A traitor to the state!<br> Anyone who hides him is a traitor too!<br> I know he's here.<br> This was his village.<br> Up there was his church.<br> This is a very rich village -<br> it seems to have lots of wax candles.<br> They were burned there last night.<br> There was water in the fountain.<br> Where's the priest?<br> Point him out.<br> You superstitious fools! Do you<br> still believe what the priests told you?<br> All they ever wanted was your money.<br> They took it and what did they give you?<br> Anything to eat?<br> Did they feed your children?<br> No. They filled you full of lies.<br> They talked to you about heaven.<br> They told you to be meek and humble.<br> Everything would be fine when you die.<br> They want you to die,<br> these priests, not live!<br> They preach against the revolution,<br> because we want you to live, not die.<br> Where's the priest?<br> Point him out.<br> There's a reward of 1,000 pesos.<br> Point him out.<br> Why don't you trust me?<br> I'll find this priest. You know why?<br> Because we're taking hostages.<br> And if you don't give up the priest,<br> we'll shoot the hostages.<br> Can't you see I'm one of you?<br> I'm doing this for your own good.<br> This priest is a coward.<br> If he were half the man you think he is,<br> he would have<br> given himself up to save you.<br> Is it worth dying for a man like this?<br> Why don't you trust me?<br> Give him up.<br> I don't want to see any of you die.<br> You're my own people.<br> Can't you understand?<br> I want to give you everything.<br> All right, I'll take you.<br> - No! No!<br> - Tally-ho!<br> No.<br> - Excellency, take me.<br> - Why should I take you?<br> He has a family. They need him.<br> I'm no good, Excellency. Take me.<br> If you're no good as a man,<br> you're no good as a hostage.<br> What will you do now, Father?<br> I'll go to Puerto Grande.<br> Sell the mule.<br> Take a boat,<br> get out of the country.<br> It's better that I go, Maria Dolores.<br> I haven't been a good priest.<br> I don't understand, Father.<br> I'm afraid I don't understand myself.<br> Be careful of the police, Father.<br> Oh, what a fine mule.<br> A beautiful mule.<br> You must be rich.<br> You come a long way, yes?<br> - How far is it to Puerto Grande?<br> - Oh, two, three days.<br> With a mule like that,<br> maybe one day.<br> Why you want to go<br> to Puerto Grande?<br> I have business there.<br> What a beautiful bag.<br> What do you have in the bag?<br> Jewels? Money?<br> A pistol, maybe?<br> - Who is that man?<br> - The Gringo.<br> Very brave man. He held up<br> a gringo bank, stole 100 dollars,<br> killed two or three people.<br> Very brave.<br> Who put that up there?<br> Why, the police, of course.<br> That's their business.<br> - How long ago were they here?<br> - Oh, two or three days.<br> Don't worry, they won't come back.<br> You think I'm worried?<br> Why do you ask about the police?<br> I'm sorry if I offended you<br> about the police.<br> Don't go. Stay here, it's better.<br> The river, it's nice.<br> It's too hot to travel.<br> - Ah, you went so fast you almost lost me.<br> - What do you want?<br> I'm going to Puerto Grande too,<br> on business.<br> It's more safe to travel together.<br> Me, I can protect you.<br> - You wouldn't refuse me, would you, sir?<br> - Why do you call me "sir"?<br> Oh, I can see you're an educated man.<br> But you are tired.<br> There's a place down here we can stop<br> and you can sleep.<br> - I'm in a hurry.<br> - Why are you in a hurry?<br> It's not good to be in a hurry.<br> It's dangerous to travel at night.<br> Gringos - wild animals, snakes,<br> they eat you up.<br> - They never touch me because I'm poor.<br> - I am also poor.<br> Oh, no, you have a mule, costly clothes,<br> a rich bank full of money.<br> But you have no gun to protect you.<br> Oh, you have a light.<br> Isn't it beautiful?<br> A wax candle.<br> They cost a lot of money, real wax. It's the<br> kind they used to have in the churches.<br> I haven't seen one since the old days.<br> That makes everything fine.<br> It's nice to be comfortable.<br> It must be wonderful to be rich.<br> Go ahead, sleep.<br> You're tired.<br> I will watch.<br> I'm never tired.<br> - Why are you going to the city?<br> - I'm keeping you company.<br> I'm protecting you.<br> I'm your guide.<br> - You said you had business there.<br> - Me?<br> When did I say that?<br> Why should I tell you lies?<br> I'm giving up my time to help you,<br> to guide you.<br> You would get lost.<br> But you don't trust me, just because<br> I'm trying to do you a good turn.<br> Cos I'm trying to be a good Christian,<br> you don't trust me.<br> You don't trust me.<br> Ah, good wine.<br> I never had wine like that before.<br> What a lovely taste.<br> It's against the law to have wine.<br> See? I'm protecting you.<br> What's the matter?<br> It wasn't consecrated, was it?<br> The wine wasn't blessed,<br> was it, Father?<br> - Why do you call me "Father"?<br> - Don't be afraid, I'm a good Christian.<br> You're wrong.<br> I can find out easily, can't I?<br> All I have to say is,<br> "Hear my confession, Father."<br> Bless me, Father,<br> for I have sinned.<br> You cannot refuse a man<br> in mortal sin, can you?<br> The light!

Just a minute.<br> Come here.<br> I am not a hard man.<br> Sit down, sit down.<br> To the contrary,<br> I always try to oblige my friends,<br> when it's in my power<br> and does no harm.<br> I have a position, you understand?<br> - These drinks come to me quite legally.<br> - Of course, Excellency.<br> - And I have to charge what they cost me.<br> - Of course, Excellency.<br> - Otherwise, I would be a ruined man.<br> - Of course, Excellency.<br> - Are you a talker?<br> - He's my cousin.<br> Not directly, you understand. By marriage.<br> His wife is related to my uncle's sister.<br> I don't mind your telling the right people,<br> you understand?<br> - Here. This is good stuff.<br> - That's brandy, Excellency.<br> - Very good brandy.<br> - But I don't want brandy, I want wine.<br> In these days,<br> you take what you get.<br> Then I think I'd rather<br> have my 20 pesos back.<br> - How much?<br> - 20 pesos.<br> (hurdy-gurdy man laughs nervously)<br> How about two bottles of brandy?<br> - One brandy and one wine, please.<br> - It's the finest brandy you can get.<br> But I'm a wine drinker, Excellency.<br> You don't know how I long for wine.<br> - How about a bottle of gin?<br> - No, no. Wine, Excellency, please.<br> I was saving this for the chief of police.<br> He is a great lover of wine.<br> - Now take it or leave it.<br> - Thank you, Excellency. Thank you.<br> Will you honour us<br> by having a drink with us?<br> Well, I don't mind.<br> It's a hot night.<br> I'll fix you up.<br> Ah, here we are, here we are.<br> Ah, no, no.<br> Wait, wait, wait. It's too hot for brandy.<br> I haven't had a glass of wine<br> in a long time.<br> Come here.<br> You don't mind if we sample it, do you?<br> Of course he don't mind.<br> That's what he wants - wine.<br> You don't care where you drink it,<br> eh, cousin?<br> Ah, here we are.<br> If you'll excuse me,<br> I think I'll have brandy.<br> What did I tell you?

Figaro!<br> - Figaro, Figaro, Figa...<br> - Excellency!<br> Shut up! Figaro!<br> - Care for another drink, Excellency?<br> - (sings) If you insist, if you insist.<br> If you insist.<br> I think I'll try the wine now.<br> It is smoother than the brandy.<br> - Excellency...<br> - Here you are.<br> Please.<br> - Cousin, what's wrong?<br> - I want to take some of that wine home.<br> - What for?<br> - For my friend.<br> Oh, you have a friend.<br> Once I had a friend myself -<br> my mother.<br> You want me to tell you?<br> Sit down here, I'll tell you all about it.<br> Although now she's dead, you know.<br> Oh, with your permission.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I think I'll try another one.<br> In fact, I think in the future,<br> I'll drink nothing else but wine.<br> - Me too.<br> - How about yourself?<br> No, thank you.<br> I think the brandy is much better.<br> That's right. That's right.<br> I'll try both.<br> (sings) I...<br> I'll try both.<br> (laughter)<br> Come in, come in.<br> Ah, never mind. Sit down, sit down.<br> We are having a little private party.<br> - Care for a little drink, Excellency?<br> - What have you got?<br> - Wine and brandy.<br> - Try both. Very smooth.<br> What the gringos call<br> a cocktail, I believe.<br> I don't mind.<br> - This gentleman isn't drinking.<br> - Oh, here, man.<br> Here, have a sip, have a sip.<br> That's a good thing.<br> That'll set you up.<br> Another one, like a real man.<br> (women laughing)<br> (hurdy-gurdy plays)<br> (man sings) Figaro!<br> Figaro!<br> - Brandy, huh?<br> - Let's go.<br> Take him to the bullpen.<br> Attention!<br> - Another one?<br> - Brandy, sir.<br> Brandy? I see no brandy.<br> - You can smell it.<br> - I smell your breath. That's enough!<br> Take his name, Sergeant.<br> Get up.<br> Bullpen.<br> Haven't I seen you before?<br> (shouts)<br> (shouting)<br> What are you doing here, Father?<br> Who caught you?<br> Who gets the reward?<br> - The men who caught me, I suppose.<br> - Who? Who? Who?<br> - The police.<br> - Oh, the traitors.<br> So that's why they got me drunk?<br> You can't believe a soul these days.<br> - You're educated. Advise me.<br> - Where are they taking him?<br> Don't worry about him, Father.<br> Worry about me, I'm a poor man.<br> I have so much to worry about, Father.<br> It's your duty to help me. Advise me.<br> Why don't you tell them now?<br> They'll give you something.<br> Something? Why shouldn't I get it all?<br> I found you. It's mine, it belongs to me.<br> Help me. We must trust each other.<br> Hey, you. Come here.<br> - Jefe wants to see you.<br> - Where are they taking him?<br> Through the town.<br> It impresses the people.<br> Stay away from that crumb.<br> He's a police squealer.<br> Brandy, eh?<br> Very, very serious.<br> Against the law, you know.<br> Where's the evidence?<br> Oh, yes. Lieutenant broke the bottle, eh?<br> Too bad.<br> Ask him where he got it.<br> At the Hotel Splendide.<br> Poor man like this?<br> The Splendide?<br> You got it from a stranger,<br> didn't you?<br> Yes.<br> And you don't know<br> his name, do you?<br> No.<br> - Did he work off his fine?<br> - He's all right.<br> Dismissed.<br> All right, fellow, all right.<br> - Father, here I am.<br> - (coins rattle)<br> Father! Father!<br> Father!<br> Father!<br> (dog barks)<br> Father! Father!<br> Did you see the priest?<br> I mean, a man?<br> Wait! Thief! I was a rich man!<br> I had a million pesos! Why did I trust him?<br> Father!<br> (cock crows)<br> (man sings)<br> (stops singing)<br> (resumes singing)<br> It's OK, sister.<br> Give the change to...<br> Good night, Father.<br> Please.<br> Father, we thought you had gone.<br> We thought you had left this land.<br> It was not to be.<br> You must get over the mountains.<br> That's the only way now.<br> I'll go with you.<br> We must start right away.<br> - If I could sleep... for a few hours.<br> - I'll get you some food.<br> But we must start right away.<br> Please.<br> The reason I'm going with you, Father,<br> is that I know the way.<br> Besides, you will be in less danger.<br> They will think I'm your wife<br> and Maria Dolores your baby.<br> I hope you're not offended, Father.<br> Are you?<br> You're not angry, Father?<br> (baby cries)<br> (cock crows)<br> (dog barks)<br> (horses approaching)<br> Father!<br> Father!<br> Father!<br> (men whoop)<br> (men shout)<br> - What's in there?<br> - My baby.<br> Please! She's asleep.<br> Keep watch for new boots, will you?<br> What have you got under here?<br> A priest maybe?<br> Maybe a sergeant.<br> Maybe a drink for a sergeant, huh?<br> (baby cries)<br> Viejo/<br> How about a little cup, hm?<br> (guitar plays)<br> Hey, what have you got in there?<br> A kiss for a sergeant maybe, huh?<br> Perhaps.<br> Awful noisy out here.<br> Let's go inside.<br> Come on, what are you afraid of?<br> Don't you want me<br> to dance for you?<br> Dance? Sure, why not?<br> I can't dance in this dress.<br> OK.<br> Go ahead.<br> Father! Father!<br> It's the police!<br> You must get away.<br> Out through the cornfield.<br> Get across the river and wait for me.<br> (baby cries)<br> Maria Dolores, shh!<br> (music plays)<br> (whoops)<br> (men whoop)<br> (music stops)<br> What kind of men are you? Are you swine,<br> enticed by the first girl to show her legs?<br> I'll get your stripes for this, Sergeant!<br> And you, with your fancy dress<br> and your bare legs, what are you?!<br> What are you? Tell me.<br> I don't know, Juan Rafael.<br> What kind of a woman am I?<br> Did I hurt you, Maria Dolores?<br> No, Juan Rafael.<br> No.<br> (gunshots)<br> They found the priest. Let's go.<br> (men whoop, whistle blows)<br> Pablo, Miguelito, hide!<br> Go on, Father. Beat it.<br> (whistle blows)<br> Whoa. Whoa.<br> (baby cries)<br> (men whoop)<br> (Juan Rafael) Get on the other side!<br> Beat that corn down and get the priest!<br> See anything?<br> (gunshot)<br> (men whoop)<br> (gunshots)<br> Five years. It's a long time.<br> I know from experience.<br> - You've shown great courage, Father.<br> - Oh, no.<br> No, it wasn't courage, Doctor.<br> I can't deceive myself.<br> It was only pride.<br> Yes, I see it now. It was pride.<br> The first year...<br> Well, the whole thing<br> seemed fantastic.<br> I couldn't believe<br> there was any real reason to leave.<br> Things like that<br> have happened before.<br> I thought I'd stay another month<br> and see if things got better.<br> And then another month and another<br> month. You know how time goes by.<br> Yes.<br> Then I began to lose grace.<br> I began to have pride.<br> I began to think I was a brave man.<br> Who knows? A martyr.<br> I suddenly realised<br> I was the only priest left in the country.<br> Those who weren't shot<br> had left, they went.<br> I can't blame them.<br> They were quite right to go.<br> But in my growing pride,<br> I couldn't understand that.<br> Oh, don't be so hard<br> on yourself, Father.<br> A man is entitled to a little pride.<br> Not in my profession. I was building<br> a fine lie and wearing it like a proud cloak.<br> The strange thing is that,<br> all the time, I knew in here<br> I wasn't cut out to be a martyr.<br> When the real test came,<br> I couldn't measure up.<br> I didn't have the courage.<br> I was afraid to give myself up.<br> I let men die for me.<br> Innocent people.<br> Well, finish your coffee.<br> - Doctor, it's time for Father's nap.<br> - Thank you.<br> Thank you, Doctor.<br> Father. Don't be frightened, Father.<br> I'm your friend.<br> - I'm here on an errand of mercy.<br> - Have you brought the police with you?<br> The police? No, I'm here to do good.<br> Believe me, Father.<br> I want to make up for my sins.<br> I have two mules outside.<br> Hurry, Father, the man is dying.<br> - What man?<br> - The Gringo.<br> The Gringo - the Americano,<br> the man the police want.<br> He robbed a bank.<br> You know the man I mean.<br> He's dying, Father.<br> He wants you to come. You cannot refuse<br> a man who is dying, Father.<br> He has so much to confess.<br> - He's never betrayed his friends.<br> - Neither have I.<br> Neither have I!<br> You don't trust me.<br> Go back where you came from.<br> You think I'm a fool.<br> The man is dying.<br> He wants a priest.<br> You're lying.<br> No. No.<br> I'll prove it.<br> No, the other side.<br> - Will he still be alive?<br> - Yes. Yes. Yes, Father.<br> Father.<br> Did you call?<br> Father.<br> Beat it, Father.<br> When did you last<br> receive the sacraments?<br> Ten...<br> fifteen years, I guess.<br> - Beat it, Father.<br> - Don't you want to confess?<br> No.<br> No.<br> You did when you wrote this.<br> I... I didn't write that, Father.<br> Beat it. Get out of here.<br> Don't be a sap. Get away!<br> You're dying. You're given this chance<br> to confess, you won't have another.<br> - Father. Father.<br> - Yes?<br> Get...<br> Get my gun, under my shoulder.<br> Get my gun, Father.<br> You're gonna need it.<br> You have no gun.<br> Lie still. It's not there.<br> Listen to me, you believed once.<br> Try and understand.<br> This is your chance. At the last moment,<br> like the thief on the cross.<br> I know you've sinned a great deal,<br> but that only belongs to this life.<br> Forget about me, Father.<br> Skip it, skip it. Take the...<br> Oh, Merciful Father,<br> the souls of the departed,<br> through the mercy of God, rest in peace.<br> Amen.<br> Have you finished?<br> Yes, I've finished.<br> You've been tried and found guilty.<br> Couldn't I have been present<br> at my own trial?<br> It wouldn't have mattered anyway.<br> - When do I?<br> - In the morning.<br> I brought you a lamp.<br> It's hard to be alone<br> on a night like this.<br> I'd rather be alone.<br> I have so much to think about.<br> May I ask you a question,<br> Lieutenant?<br> - When did you lose your faith?<br> - When I found a better one!<br> Look, priest, I have nothing against you<br> as a man. My viewpoint...<br> I know that.<br> I'm the sort of man you lock up every day<br> and give money to.<br> I hate your arguments.<br> If you see somebody in pain, people<br> like you say perhaps pain is a good thing.<br> Right now you're shivering cos you're<br> afraid of a little pain when you're shot.<br> Well, I'm not a saint.<br> I'm not even a brave man.<br> I'm a coward.<br> But the priesthood is large,<br> it's tremendous.<br> I was always too small for it.<br> (thunder)<br> You know, it's very strange,<br> but I'm beginning not to be afraid.<br> - Even you believe in God.<br> - That's not true!<br> Of course you believe.<br> That's why you're afraid.<br> You want to kill God<br> and you can't do it.<br> That's a lot of nonsense.<br> You can't tell me you're not afraid.<br> - Listen, priest, do you want to die?<br> - No.<br> Well, maybe I can help you.<br> I'll go to the governor myself.<br> Renounce your faith<br> publicly tomorrow.<br> Say to the people<br> you've been telling them lies.<br> I'm sorry, Lieutenant.<br> In the village,<br> there's an Indian woman.<br> Maria Dolores.<br> Yes, a good woman.<br> You baptised her child, didn't you?<br> Yes.<br> Can I get you some brandy?<br> Lt'll make it easier in the morning.<br> It's very kind of you,<br> but no, thanks.<br> - It'll make you forget.<br> - No.<br> I want to live my death.<br> Father.<br> Father.<br> (bugle call)<br> Ready?<br> Get going.<br> Well, that's the last one, eh?<br> If you want me,<br> I'll be in the Hotel Splendide.<br> Squad, halt!<br> About face!<br> Forward, hut!<br> Your blessing, Father!<br> Your blessing!<br> - You can't sell a blessing.<br> - Forward!<br> Go home and pray.<br> Give the money to the poor.<br> March!<br> (praying)<br> (gunshot)<br> (gunshot)<br> (knock at door)<br> (knocking continues)<br> I am the new priest.<br> I am Father Serra.<br>
