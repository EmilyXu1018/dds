                        Don't let it bother you<br> When things go wrong<br> If you're glum, just hum<br> And some good luck will come along<br> Don't let it bother you<br> If now and then<br> You may stumble, never grumble<br> Count from one to 10<br> - A frown is a smile upside down<br> - So turn that frown upside down<br> And smile<br> And sing oh-la-la-la<br> Don't let it bother you<br> If skies are gray<br> Learn to grin<br> And take it on the chin<br> Then everything will be okay<br> Oh, it's no use, Guy.<br> Mine has housemaid's knee.<br> Don't be discouraged, Egbert.<br> I think you show distinct tendencies<br> towards terpsichorean excellence.<br> You think so, really?<br> You know, as a matter of fact...<br> ...my inner soul has always yearned<br> to express itself in the dance.<br> - lf you were I, what would you do?<br> - Stick to law.<br> Spoken like a real native.<br> Do you recognize it?<br> No.<br> What? Oh, yes.<br> Oh, my, Guy,<br> this is an expensive place here.<br> Guy, in the excitement of changing<br> my clothes on that train...<br> ...I left my wallet in that other suit.<br> Egbert, what would you do without me?<br> I mean to say...<br> I've been in America<br> for several months with my friend.<br> We're passing through Paris on our way<br> to London. We're taking the boat tomorrow.<br> I am the proprietor.<br> What can I do for you?<br> Well, I'm afraid we'll have to mail you<br> the amount of the check.<br> Well, monsieur, I do not know you.<br> This gentleman's father<br> is Sir Frederick Fitzgerald...<br> ...the distinguished London attorney.<br> Yes, and I'm a lawyer too.<br> You, monsieur?<br> My friend here is Guy Holden,<br> the American dancer.<br> Musical comedy and whatnot.<br> Certainly you've heard of Holden.<br> Oh, yes, I have heard of Guy Holden.<br> But, monsieur, have you any means<br> of identification?<br> Well, you see, we...<br> Left them in the other suit.<br> Oh, yes, yes, yes.<br> Well, I...<br> I have it, I have it.<br> Look here, old chap,<br> if my friend dances like Guy Holden...<br> ...that proves he is Guy Holden,<br> doesn't it?<br> Go ahead, Guy, dash them off<br> a bit of a minuet...<br> ...or a polka or a schottische.<br> Now, wait a minute, I'm on my vacation.<br> I'm not going to do any dancing.<br> I've heard they make you<br> wash dishes in Paris.<br> There you are.<br> That means nothing.<br> Then you try it.<br> Suppose you do it over there.<br> - With all these people around?<br> - Well, if you are Guy Holden...<br> ...people should not disturb you.<br> No.<br> French cooking must make the dishes<br> very difficult to wash.<br> Guy, never mind.<br> Thank you.<br> Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald.<br> Mr. Fitzgerald.<br> - Mr. Fitzgerald.<br> - Who is it? What's the matter?<br> What do you want?<br> - Mr. Fitzgerald?<br> - Yes.<br> - Mr. Pinky Fitzgerald?<br> - Yes.<br> Pinky? That's the first time<br> I've heard that one.<br> Must be from Father.<br> He's always called me Pinky.<br> Ever since I was a golden-haired little tot<br> paddling about in pale-pink pajamas.<br> What do you want?<br> Tip that boy, will you?<br> Read that for me.<br> I'm all involved here, Guy, please.<br> - Thank you, governor.<br> - Right you are.<br> Yes, it's from your father. He says:<br> "Leaving for Scotland. Stop.<br> Take charge of office in my absence. Stop."<br> Good. Father's placing everything<br> in my hands.<br> But I haven't finished yet. He also says:<br> "But don't do anything, just sit."<br> Let me see that.<br> Why, Pinky, evidently you've been<br> in charge of the office before.<br> - Excuse me. Can you help me in section D?<br> - What is it?<br> - I can't do a thing with her, sir.<br> - Who?<br> The lady in section D, sir.<br> She's an American.<br> You know how these Americans are, sir.<br> - When finished, look after that gentleman.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Will you gentlemen come with me, please?<br> Excuse me, madam, I am the chief<br> inspector. Anything I can do for you?<br> You most certainly can.<br> This man wants to mess up my trunks...<br> ...after I've packed the lovely things<br> I bought in Paris.<br> I'm very sorry, madam,<br> but we have to inspect all luggage...<br> ...for dutiable merchandise.<br> Now, madam, how much<br> did you pay for this?<br> That? Oh, now, how much<br> did I pay for that?<br> I know I paid an awful lot. But I shouldn't<br> be telling you that, should I?<br> - Where did you buy it?<br> - Where did I buy it? Oh, now, let me see.<br> What was the name of that town?<br> - Paris?<br> - Paris? No. No, it wasn't Paris.<br> - Lyons?<br> - No. No, it wasn't Lyons...<br> ...but you're getting warmer.<br> - Nice?<br> - Niece. Yes, that's who I'm waiting for.<br> - What?<br> - Yes, my niece, Mimi.<br> I sent her a cable to London<br> and told her to meet me here.<br> - Where is she?<br> - I'm sure I don't know, madam.<br> This is the only other place<br> she might be.<br> Oh, there she is.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Hortense.<br> - Mimi, dear.<br> How are you?<br> Oh, you look perfectly marvelous.<br> Yes, don't I.<br> This is my niece, Mimi.<br> I told you about her.<br> The poor thing has had her life<br> all mixed up...<br> ...but I've come over expressly<br> to straighten it all out for her.<br> Madam, we would appreciate it<br> if you'd straighten this matter out first.<br> Well, what is it you want me to do?<br> Come with me and we'll make<br> a declaration of all your purchases.<br> Everything's so topsy-turvy.<br> Will you put those things in<br> while I lock this?<br> - These?<br> - Yes, please.<br> Would you be good enough<br> to hold this for me? Thank you.<br> - Did you have a nice trip?<br> - I had a marvelous trip. I adore Paris.<br> It's so like Chicago.<br> I enjoyed every minute of it.<br> It's such a relief when you're traveling<br> to feel that you've never left home at all.<br> I shouldn't be long, dear.<br> Come along, men.<br> Porter. Porter.<br> - Oh, porter.<br> - Sorry, I'm busy, ma'am.<br> Porter.<br> Oh, porter. Porter.<br> Porter.<br> Porter. Porter.<br> Porter.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Can I be of any assistance?<br> Why... Well, yes.<br> My aunt is in the inspector's office.<br> Would you call her for me?<br> - Well, yes, indeed.<br> - Thank you.<br> With pleasure.<br> - You're an American, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - So am I.<br> - So is my aunt.<br> You know, the one you were<br> going to call for me.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Is there anything special<br> you want me to tell her?<br> Well, you might tell her<br> that my dress is caught.<br> Your dress is caught.<br> My, my.<br> - Locked.<br> - Yes.<br> And you want me to call your aunt?<br> Yes.<br> You know, a third party<br> might spoil this.<br> Porter. Oh, porter.<br> Oh, porter. Porter.<br> There's no reason why I can't<br> handle this myself.<br> I pulled a cat out of a well once<br> when I was a boy.<br> Now, let me see...<br> - Maybe I should've called your aunt.<br> - Well...<br> Oh, I'm awfully sorry. Please take this.<br> - Please forgive me.<br> - I'm living in London.<br> Where can I return this to you?<br> Oh, I'm stopping in London too.<br> May I save you the trouble and call for it?<br> I'd rather you wouldn't.<br> Well, here's my address.<br> I'll be waiting to hear from you.<br> - You didn't say goodbye.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> Well, that's wonderful.<br> That means I'll see you again.<br> I'll pay it, but I want to know<br> how every cent is spent.<br> Oh, here you are, Hortense.<br> I just had the most embarrassing<br> experience.<br> A man tore my dress off.<br> My goodness. Anyone we know?<br> - Hortense.<br> - Here you are, madam.<br> Oh, for me? And I do adore fruit baskets.<br> Oh, isn't he generous.<br> You shouldn't have been so extravagant.<br> After all, we've just met, you know.<br> Not bad. Not bad at all.<br> Have you time for an encore?<br> - Sorry, guvnor. My time's too valuable.<br> - Oh, so sorry.<br> Don't you want to ask me<br> who sent that, sir?<br> Oh, I see, the play spirit.<br> All right, tell me. Who sent it?<br> The young lady gave me 3 shillings,<br> sir, and asked me not to tell.<br> Oh, yes. I see.<br> "And asked me not to tell."<br> - Guy.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Package for you.<br> - A package?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, that's my raincoat.<br> That must be her handwriting.<br> Let me see.<br> I used to study handwriting.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, it's very neat.<br> Yes. The O's and the A's are open.<br> That means extravagance.<br> Look at the way she crosses her T's.<br> That denotes temper.<br> She makes little circles instead of dots.<br> Dreadful. It's an unfailing sign of vanity.<br> Yes. Of course, don't let me<br> discourage you. l...<br> Guy, what is the matter with you?<br> You seem to be under some sort of a spell.<br> I am, and for the first time in my life.<br> What are you looking for?<br> - Where's the note?<br> - Oh, no note.<br> - No note?<br> - No note.<br> - Did you talk to the messenger?<br> - I did.<br> And he said that she asked him<br> not to tell where it came from.<br> I wonder if she resented<br> my tearing her skirt.<br> Well, I wouldn't be at all surprised.<br> That's the usual reaction.<br> - What did you do that for?<br> - She couldn't move.<br> Sounds very unsporting of you.<br> Guy, really.<br> Well, you don't understand.<br> You see, she... It was an accident.<br> - It usually is. What's her name?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Where does she live?<br> - I don't know.<br> My, what an interesting romance.<br> I was in hopes that she'd send some note<br> with this raincoat, along with her address.<br> Well, without having the prophetic powers<br> of a seventh son...<br> ...I would hazard that she doesn't want<br> to see you anymore.<br> Yes. Well...<br> ...I'm going to rush off<br> to the office.<br> - What are you going to do, Guy?<br> - I'm going to start looking for her.<br> I'll find that girl, Egbert,<br> if it takes me from now on.<br> Well, it shouldn't be difficult. After all,<br> there are only 3 million women in London.<br> It's just like looking for a needle<br> In a hay stack<br> Searching for a moonbeam in the blue<br> Still, I've gotta find you<br> It's just like looking for a raindrop<br> In the ocean<br> Searching for a dewdrop in the dew<br> Still, I've got to find you<br> I'll roam the town<br> In hopes that we'll meet<br> Look at each face<br> I pass on the street<br> For sometimes I hear<br> The beat of your feet<br> But it's just imagination<br> Oh, it's like looking for a needle<br> In a haystack<br> Still, I'll follow every little clue<br> 'Cause I've got to find you<br> It's just like looking for a needle<br> In a haystack<br> Searching for a moonbeam in the blue<br> Still, I've got to find you<br> It's just like looking for a raindrop<br> In the ocean<br> Searching for a dewdrop in the dew<br> Still, I've gotta find you<br> I'll roam the town<br> In hopes that we'll meet<br> Look at each face<br> I pass on the street<br> Sometimes I hear<br> The beat of your feet<br> But it's just imagination<br> Though it's like looking for a needle<br> In a haystack<br> Still, I'll follow every little clue<br> 'Cause I've gotta find you<br> Hello, hello.<br> I've been looking for you.<br> Well, wait a minute.<br> Please stop. I want to talk to you.<br> Isn't it peaceful here?<br> Would you mind moving your car,<br> or don't you want it anymore?<br> Yes, Guy, it is peaceful, isn't it?<br> What a shame.<br> Two perfectly beautiful cars.<br> In a moment,<br> the air will be full of fenders.<br> Wait. Would you mind hitting it<br> just about there?<br> That cigarette lighter<br> never did work anyway.<br> Well, don't say I didn't warn you.<br> Porter. Porter.<br> Can't do it.<br> I guess I'm too economical.<br> Now there.<br> Can I offer you something?<br> Frosted chocolate, Cointreau,<br> Benedictine, marriage?<br> What was that last?<br> - Benedictine.<br> - No, after that.<br> Oh, marriage.<br> Do you always propose marriage<br> as casually as that?<br> There's nothing casual about it.<br> I've given it a lot of sincere thought.<br> Matter of fact, I've lost sleep.<br> Do you realize I've spent<br> the last two weeks looking for you?<br> Didn't you get your coat all right?<br> Yes, but I missed something.<br> Some little note telling me<br> where I could get in touch with you.<br> I've got to know something<br> about you:<br> Whether you're happy,<br> what flowers you like...<br> ...your favorite books and music.<br> Look, when do I see you again?<br> Won't you please tell me<br> where I can get in touch with you?<br> You can't.<br> I'm staying with friends, old friends.<br> You'd be much too upsetting. I wouldn't<br> know what you were going to do next.<br> Well, if you won't give me<br> your phone number, here's mine.<br> Just wasting paper.<br> I thought you were economical.<br> That's better.<br> May I go now?<br> All right. But you will try<br> and call me tomorrow, won't you?<br> I'll be waiting.<br> I'll be waiting every day.<br> And then I'll rest up at night<br> so I can wait some more.<br> I say, old chap, do you mind<br> letting us through here?<br> Oh, rather. Right you are. Cheerio.<br> Right you are, sorry.<br> Awfully sorry, folks. Right.<br> I bought this in a sporting goods store.<br> Wait. You didn't tell me your name.<br> Mimi.<br> Mimi?<br> Mimi.<br> - I'll tell Mr. Fitzgerald you're here, Mrs...<br> - Thank you very much.<br> Hortense, it's hopeless.<br> I don't know why we're here.<br> Darling, Egbert's<br> a very old friend of mine.<br> He doesn't know much about law.<br> It's his father who's the brains.<br> You know, all of his family<br> spent their entire lives at the bar.<br> Dear Egbert. He was nearly<br> my third husband.<br> He would have been, too, but he suddenly<br> left for India on an elephant hunt.<br> I wonder why he preferred to hunt elephants<br> when he could've married me.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Ditherwell, Mr. Fitzgerald<br> doesn't seem to recall your name.<br> Why, what do you mean, he doesn't?<br> Oh, of course, I've been married again.<br> He wouldn't know me as Ditherwell.<br> That was my third husband, my last.<br> Now, let me see.<br> What name did Egbert know me by?<br> Hortense, darling.<br> I didn't marry in 1929 or '30.<br> That was the year of the crash. Men<br> didn't know whether they had money.<br> Well... Well, I tell you<br> just what you say.<br> You say "peanuts." He'll know.<br> - Peanuts?<br> - Yes.<br> You know, the association of ideas.<br> Peanut, elephant. Elephant hunt, me.<br> - I'll tell him "peanuts," madam.<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, yes, yes.<br> She said to say, "peanuts."<br> Oh, did she?<br> Well, tell her I don't want any.<br> She also mentioned something about India.<br> Elephant hunting.<br> Well, that makes it,<br> "peanuts, India, elephant hunt."<br> That doesn't make sense. Horte...<br> Oh, no. No, it couldn't be.<br> Tell her I'm not here.<br> Tell her I'm in conference.<br> Tell her I'm out of town.<br> Egbert, darling.<br> Oh, darling.<br> Oh, you mustn't mind him.<br> He's so impetuous.<br> You do look wonderful,<br> and you look just the same.<br> The same sweet smile,<br> and the same dear little eyes.<br> I want you to meet my niece,<br> Mrs. Glossop.<br> Mrs. Glossop.<br> - How do you do, Mrs. Glossop?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Glad to know you.<br> - Thank you. Well, yes. Sit down.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> I'm here professionally, Egbert.<br> This poor little thing is married,<br> unhappily married.<br> Now, isn't that criminal?<br> It's no crime to be married.<br> Just shows a weakness on the part<br> of men that women take advantage of.<br> Egbert, are you proposing to me again?<br> No, no, no.<br> Mrs. Glossop, I presume, has a problem.<br> Yes, I have.<br> There are so many things in connection<br> with it that I hardly know where to begin.<br> - Oh, well...<br> - Sit down, Egbert.<br> I'll tell him all about it.<br> You see, she's been married two years<br> and she's scarcely ever seen her husband.<br> In fact, she never hears from him<br> unless he wants some of her money.<br> I met him at school.<br> He was one of my instructors.<br> Yes, he's a geometrist.<br> Oh, a geometrist.<br> - No, darling, a geologist.<br> - Oh, a geologist.<br> Well, all right, a geologist.<br> What difference does it make?<br> It's all the same.<br> - You know, rocks and things.<br> - He threw them?<br> No, he digs them, he digs them.<br> Well, have you asked your husband<br> for a divorce?<br> Repeatedly, but he refuses to even<br> discuss it with me.<br> Well, you understand that<br> obtaining a divorce in England...<br> ...is a very difficult thing,<br> unless the husband agrees to grant it.<br> Oh, Egbert, I didn't know you like dolls.<br> He always had the mother instinct.<br> Ladies, as your legal adviser,<br> I would suggest that we resort to a...<br> - Thingamajig.<br> - Flagrante delicto.<br> - Why? Yes, yes, of course.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> You know, I had one<br> at my second divorce.<br> Yes. Of course, Mrs. Glossop...<br> ...the details are very simple.<br> - A seaside hotel and...<br> - Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll do anything you say.<br> And leave the further details<br> to the two of you.<br> I think really it would be<br> much better for me if you remained.<br> No, no, run along, dear.<br> I'll fix everything.<br> Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald,<br> and I feel very comfortable in your hands.<br> Really? Well, Mrs. Glossop,<br> I'll work my brain to the bone for you.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Now, let's get right down to business.<br> Oh, Egbert.<br> I mean the hotel.<br> I know a very nice one<br> just opening at Brightbourne.<br> It's the hotel Bella Vista.<br> Oh, Bella Vista,<br> and so easy to remember.<br> I had a cook named Bella once,<br> or was it a masseur?<br> Well, anyway, I'll have my niece<br> drive down...<br> ...and she'll meet you there tomorrow<br> at the Hotel Maryland.<br> No, no, no, that wasn't it, was it?<br> But it had something to do with<br> a girl's name.<br> Perhaps you'd better take this with you.<br> The Bella Vista. Of course.<br> That's what I said in the first place, isn't it?<br> Oh, goodbye, Egbert.<br> You know, divorces make me<br> so sentimental.<br> Don't you wish it was ours?<br> Yes, miss.<br> I understand, miss.<br> - Who was it? A man or woman?<br> - A lady, sir.<br> - Did she give you a message?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Well, what is it, what is it? Tell me.<br> It's no use getting excited, sir.<br> It was the wrong number.<br> Well, get everything ready. Hurry, hurry.<br> I'm leaving for the seashore immediately.<br> What, did another woman<br> propose to you?<br> Yes, sort of... No, no, no, no.<br> I've got a case.<br> - Case of what?<br> - Oh, dear. A divorce case.<br> With father out of town,<br> this is my opportunity.<br> - I'm going to handle it all myself.<br> - That will be good.<br> Yes. Hurry, man. Pack my things.<br> And Mr. Guy's also, sir?<br> What's he got to do with it?<br> Of course, a splendid idea.<br> You've got to come along.<br> Change will do you good.<br> You look a little liverish.<br> It isn't liver, sir. It's love, sir.<br> I can't leave London.<br> I'm waiting for a telephone call.<br> Guy, you're not pining for that girl?<br> Pining? Men don't pine. Girls pine.<br> Men just...<br> ...suffer.<br> Guy, she hasn't called you in<br> over a fortnight.<br> It's perfectly obvious<br> that she's not interested.<br> You pulled her gown.<br> She pulled your leg.<br> - Maybe you're right.<br> - Of course.<br> I never waited two minutes<br> for a girl in my life...<br> ...and here I've waited two weeks<br> for this one.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - Brightbourne, a marvelous hotel.<br> To the Hotel Mabel...<br> The Margaret... The Nellie...<br> Confound that woman.<br> Why did she come back into my life?<br> It doesn't make any difference.<br> The change will do you good.<br> Sea air, sunshine, gaiety, girls.<br> You're my type<br> Of a shy type of a beau, dear<br> Beg pardon?<br> So let's do things<br> Well, really.<br> I'll teach you a few things<br> Are you talking to me?<br> Now, who said just what you said<br> For I know, dear<br> No, no, I've been reading. Look here.<br> I'm not bashful<br> I'm mashful and pashful<br> I'm beginning to sense that.<br> When you're near I feel<br> So let's play house-y<br> Oh, you make me feel<br> So Mickey Mouse-y<br> For a well-known lawyer,<br> at a place like this...<br> You're sweet and so agreeable<br> And I feel so gosh-oh-geeable<br> Do warm me or I'll freeze<br> And let's k-nock k-nees<br> You are so bill and coo-able<br> And I'm so l-love-you-able<br> Come cuddle closer, please<br> And let's k-nock k-nees<br> Is this sort of a game?<br> They say make hay while the sun shines<br> It's an agricultural term.<br> So let's, oh, let's make hey-hey-hey<br> While the moon shines<br> My heart's so tick-tock-tick-able<br> Your lips are so lipstick-able<br> You know your ABCs<br> So let's k-nock k-nees<br> Oh, Guy...<br> Never mind.<br> It's so incomprehensible<br> It doesn't seem quite sensible<br> And yet I like it<br> Please, let's knock knees<br> It's almost hoi polloi-able<br> And yet it's quite enjoyable<br> Oh, I'm full of rhapsody<br> Too many people here.<br> Tripping, skipping, lightly bounding<br> - Stop it, knock it<br> - Really, this is most astounding<br> It makes one feel so thrill-able<br> Well, we've exhausted every syllable<br> I crave frivolity<br> I've got one. Let's k-nock...<br> Let's knock knees<br> Let's knock knees<br> Hello, hello.<br> Thank you, thank you.<br> Well, I've been looking all over for you.<br> - Just dancing.<br> - Oh, is that what it was?<br> This is a marvelous place, isn't it, Guy?<br> Remind me to come down here the next<br> time I want my constitution undermined.<br> I think it's wonderful.<br> Oh, what is the matter with you?<br> Are you still moping over that same girl?<br> Why, the world is just full of girls.<br> I know, I know, but not like her.<br> She's music.<br> She's the buzzing of the bees in clover.<br> She's the rustle of the leaves<br> in the trees.<br> She's water lapping on the shore.<br> Yes. She sounds like<br> a series of strange noises to me.<br> Well, cheer up, Guy, cheer up.<br> You may chance across her<br> again some time.<br> I know I will.<br> And when I do,<br> it won't be chance.<br> Chance is the fool's name for fate.<br> What was that last?<br> "Chance is the fool's name for fate"?<br> Guy, that's marvelous.<br> Where did you get it?<br> Where did I get it?<br> It's just a line from my last show,<br> that's all.<br> It's wonderful.<br> Make a good title for a song.<br> Chance is the fool's name for fate, my lad<br> Chance...<br> Do you mind if I use it? Come in handy,<br> you know, to shoot into a conversation.<br> Go ahead, spring it on your father.<br> It may encourage him about you.<br> "Chance is the fool's name for fate."<br> I'll have to remember that.<br> I love the place.<br> Oh, if Father could only see...<br> ...with what clat I am upholding<br> the professional dignity of the firm.<br> Guy, I'm going to stay here<br> and wait for my client.<br> Without me, Egbert.<br> I'm going to my room.<br> - I'll see you later.<br> - Well, I'll be here.<br> Pardon, you rang, sir?<br> Who, me? Why, my dear fellow,<br> what is there here to ring with?<br> Pardon, sir, that's just a figure of speech.<br> Well, bring me...<br> Let me have a...<br> There. There, you see?<br> Your figure of speech has made me<br> forget entirely what I wanted.<br> Could it have been<br> that you required crumpets, sir?<br> No, no, no. I never ring for crumpets.<br> Would you be the kind of man<br> who'd ring for a toasted scone, sir?<br> Scone? Well, now...<br> No, no, try me again.<br> Well, then, can you imagine yourself...<br> ...with a hankering<br> for a nice gooseberry tart?<br> Oh, what an acid thought. Please.<br> No crumpets, no scones,<br> no gooseberry tart.<br> Well, that lands both of us<br> in a cul-de-sac, doesn't it, sir?<br> Of course it does. I knew it would.<br> You know, I hate to leave you like this.<br> You, torn with doubts...<br> ...and me with my duty undischarged.<br> Oh, well, cheer up, old man, cheer up.<br> It will come to me.<br> Was it animal or vegetable, sir?<br> No.<br> Well, that leaves us mineral, doesn't it, sir?<br> Now, sir, was it a bit of half-and-half?<br> A noggin of ale...<br> ...a pipkin of porter...<br> ...a stoup of stout...<br> ...or a beaker of beer?<br> Tea.<br> Tea? Well, isn't it a small world, sir?<br> - Hello, Mrs. Glossop.<br> - Oh, hello, Mr. Fitzgerald.<br> Well, well, well.<br> All ready for graduation day?<br> Oh, hello, Egbert.<br> Oh, no. It can't...<br> Oh, it is. It's a stowaway.<br> I thought you might forget something,<br> so I came down to help you.<br> So good of you. Yes, yes.<br> Now, Mrs. Glossop, before you register...<br> ...I'm very anxious to have just a few<br> last words with you.<br> - Last words?<br> - Yes, if you don't mind. Right here.<br> Thank you. Now...<br> Oh, Egbert.<br> Pardon.<br> Yes. Now...<br> I have come to the conclusion<br> that to expedite matters...<br> ...it will be necessary for someone<br> to discover you with someone...<br> ...other than your husband.<br> Just as a matter of form, of course.<br> Hortense, I don't think I can go<br> through with it.<br> Now, don't be silly. Get it over with.<br> Think of Cyril Glossop. Think hard.<br> I knew that would do it.<br> Good. Now, the young man<br> is on his way here.<br> You understand, of course,<br> it wouldn't be technically correct...<br> ...for me to introduce you.<br> He will present himself to you.<br> Then we'll need a password.<br> It's too mysterious and wonderful.<br> Well, I have the password. I have it.<br> The young man will say to you,<br> "Chance is the fool's name for fate."<br> Shakespeare?<br> Nothing of the kind.<br> It's a thing of my own.<br> "Chance is the fool's name for fate."<br> Good. That's just it. Yes.<br> Now, it will be necessary<br> for you to have a name.<br> A name, of course, yes.<br> So your name will be Mrs. Green.<br> Green. I do adore green.<br> And, you know, the oculists say<br> it's very soothing to the eye.<br> Oh, Egbert, are you coming with us?<br> Why, Hortense. Oh, my, no.<br> You can't remain with her.<br> This is supposed to be<br> a clandestine affair.<br> You can't have a clandestine affair<br> between three people.<br> That's what you say.<br> By any chance, are you Mr. Tonetti?<br> Rudolfo Tonetti at your service.<br> Yes. Well, I am Mr. Fitzgerald.<br> Mr. Fitzgerald? I am delightful.<br> I shouldn't doubt it, old man.<br> I shouldn't doubt it.<br> But don't you think a corespondent<br> ought to come to work quietly?<br> Let's have more repose<br> and less Rigoletto.<br> I am ready for action<br> and I will do a first-class job.<br> Well, don't be too determined about it.<br> The lady in question is very sensitive<br> and you must treat her accordingly.<br> Whichever way the wind,<br> she is blowing, that is the way I sail.<br> - Yes. Well, sit down.<br> - Pardon, your tea, sir.<br> Your life, Mr. Tonetti...<br> ...must be full of excitement.<br> Full of excitement and full of danger.<br> - Oh, yes, of course, from the husbands.<br> - No, from the ladies.<br> Oh, how interesting.<br> But, Tonetti, he know what to do.<br> Yes, sometimes the lady and I<br> have the conversations.<br> Sometimes I play the concertina.<br> Sometimes I play the solitaire,<br> but mostly I practice my singing.<br> At home, my wife<br> do not like me to sing.<br> Unquestionably, a woman<br> of great perspicacity.<br> You bet.<br> You're absolutely sure, Mr. Tonetti,<br> that my client will be safe?<br> Oh, signor, with me, strictly business.<br> My slogan:<br> "Your wife is safe with Tonetti.<br> He prefer spaghetti."<br> Now, listen.<br> - I'll give you the password.<br> - Yes.<br> When you see the lady,<br> you must go to her...<br> ...and say, "Chance is<br> the fool's name for fate."<br> - "Chance is the foolish name..."<br> - "For fate."<br> "The fool's name for fate."<br> Yes. Well, tell me, please,<br> what she mean?<br> Well, you have to have some method.<br> You have to... When you...<br> Who? Oh, never mind.<br> - Never mind what it means. Just say it.<br> - Yes.<br> Now, Tonetti, remember...<br> ...I want delicacy, tact,<br> assurance, finesse.<br> I have brought everything.<br> And now, con permesso, I go inside<br> to make the telephone call...<br> ...to tell my wife I am safely arrive.<br> "Fate is no fooling..." No.<br> "Chances are a foolish..."<br> Oh, scusi, please.<br> "Taking the name of a foolish..."<br> Pardon, ma'am,<br> can I be of service to you?<br> I doubt it.<br> Let me have the menu.<br> I'm waiting for my niece.<br> What have you?<br> Crumpets, ma'am.<br> That's too bad, isn't it.<br> Does it run in the family?<br> Begging your pardon, ma'am,<br> but that's very "whumsical."<br> - What?<br> - Very "whumsical," ma'am.<br> You know, like Sir James Barrie.<br> You mean "whimsical," don't you?<br> In a manner of speaking, yes, ma'am.<br> Why not "whamsical," then?<br> Pardon, ma'am, but "whumsical" is<br> much more whimsical than "whamsical."<br> You know, you're beginning to fascinate me<br> and I resent that in any man.<br> I'm sorry, ma'am.<br> Oh, hello, darling.<br> I was just going to order.<br> I really can't eat a thing.<br> But you must eat. After all, you can't<br> have a divorce on an empty stomach.<br> What's the matter?<br> You look as though<br> you'd seen your husband.<br> It's Guy Holden,<br> the man I told you about.<br> What have you done?<br> Sent out invitations for this affair?<br> Well, I didn't know he was here.<br> Oh, he mustn't see me.<br> Mimi. Mimi.<br> Mimi.<br> I've been chasing after you.<br> You mustn't run like that.<br> - Why not?<br> - It's bad for my health.<br> What are you doing here?<br> - Same as you.<br> - What?<br> I came down here<br> looking for pieces of my heart.<br> Oh, no. Mimi, do you know<br> what I've been doing?<br> Thinking of you, longing for you,<br> waiting to hear from you.<br> I haven't left my telephone.<br> Well, as I remember it,<br> you gave me a London number.<br> Well, I had to come down here<br> just overnight.<br> A little business.<br> Oh, yes, I saw quite a few of them<br> in bathing suits this afternoon.<br> Oh, no, Mimi. Nothing like that.<br> Why didn't you at least<br> just leave some message for me?<br> - I did.<br> - You did?<br> But they said that you'd left London.<br> Mimi, you did call. That's wonderful.<br> I'd better leave now.<br> Please don't go.<br> It's going to be grand here.<br> They're having a gala on the esplanade.<br> It's usually pretty terrible.<br> But think what it will mean<br> to miss seeing it.<br> It's worthwhile staying down here<br> just to miss it.<br> Please don't ask me to stay.<br> All right, I won't.<br> Don't go. I've so many things<br> to say to you.<br> Like the beat, beat, beat<br> Of the tom-tom<br> When the jungle shadows fall<br> Like the tick, tick, tock<br> Of the stately clock<br> As it stands against the wall<br> Like the drip, drip, drip<br> Of the raindrops<br> When the summer shower is through<br> So a voice within me keeps repeating<br> "You, you, you"<br> Night and day<br> You are the one<br> Only you beneath the moon<br> And under the sun<br> Whether near to me or far<br> It's no matter, darling<br> Where you are<br> I think of you<br> Night and day<br> Day and night<br> Why is it so<br> That this longing for you<br> Follows wherever I go?<br> In the roaring traffic's boom<br> In the silence of my lonely room<br> I think of you<br> Night and day<br> Night and day<br> Under the hide of me<br> There's an oh-such-a-hungry yearning<br> Burning inside of me<br> And its torment<br> Won't be through<br> Till you let me spend my life<br> Making love to you<br> Day and night<br> Night and day<br> Cigarette?<br> I still don't know<br> what you're doing down here.<br> I came down with my aunt.<br> Isn't that a coincidence.<br> I'm here with my aunt too. Aunt Egbert.<br> Egbert?<br> Yes, Egbert Fitzgerald,<br> lawyer friend of mine.<br> We're down here on a case.<br> Aren't you ever gonna stop<br> running away from me?<br> When two people are destined<br> to come together as we are...<br> ...there's no use in struggling.<br> Do you believe in that kind of destiny?<br> Of course I do. In these things<br> there's no such a thing as chance.<br> "Chance is the fool's name for fate."<br> You?<br> You?<br> Me?<br> Why, yes, of course it is.<br> So you're the man I've been waiting for.<br> None other.<br> I'll be waiting for you<br> in my room, 216, at midnight.<br> My dear, it's 12:00.<br> I feel just like New Year's Eve.<br> Good luck to you.<br> Oh, don't leave me.<br> I can't bear to face him.<br> He seems so different.<br> Oh, there's nothing different<br> about any of them except the neckties.<br> Him, of all people.<br> Well, aren't you even astonished?<br> Me? Astonished?<br> I haven't been astonished since I was 8.<br> And mind you, I wasn't precocious,<br> just moderately intelligent.<br> I'll give him the most miserable night<br> of his entire business career.<br> A locked door between us.<br> You seem to be going to a lot of trouble<br> for a man you hate.<br> Could anything be more degrading?<br> Well, after all, my dear...<br> ...a corespondent must be<br> something of an artist.<br> He has to have<br> a sense of balance, you know.<br> Rather like a mountain goat.<br> Well, I think I'll look up Egbert.<br> The poor darling<br> must be lost without me.<br> Oh, you needn't run away.<br> I knew you were coming here.<br> - You knew?<br> - Of course. I'm Mimi's aunt.<br> I know, but I have relatives myself.<br> This isn't exactly old-home week, is it?<br> Well, nothing is ever done without me.<br> You're not planning to be there.<br> Well, of course not.<br> Just a moment, please. You see...<br> ...I don't know Mimi very well.<br> I wish you'd please tell me about her.<br> Well, I'll let her tell you.<br> After all, if she has to keep you here...<br> ...she'll want something<br> to talk about, won't she?<br> Keep me here?<br> Well, she has to.<br> Say, which one of us is crazy?<br> Well, it's not me.<br> All of this is a bit of a shock to me.<br> Well, your being here<br> is a bit of a shock to Mimi too.<br> Yes, but it's Mimi's own doing.<br> Well, I think it's much better<br> to have this settled now, at once.<br> And then the poor girl<br> can start a new life.<br> A new life?<br> Brand-new. She's gonna make<br> a clean sweep of the old.<br> - I see.<br> - Yes. Yes, and you're the broom.<br> I'll be right out.<br> I'm sorry I've kept you waiting.<br> Mimi.<br> Mimi, there's something I wanna...<br> ...get straight in my mind.<br> - Yes?<br> At first you were so shy<br> and so reserved...<br> ...and then this evening you were...<br> Well, what was I?<br> - Lovely.<br> - Was I?<br> Yes, but that's not<br> what I'm trying to say.<br> Well, what are you trying to say?<br> Well, I'm trying<br> to describe the shock. You see...<br> Well, that negligee<br> is charming. Charming.<br> - From Paris, isn't it?<br> - You ought to know.<br> You've probably seen plenty of them.<br> Well, a few, of course.<br> Of course.<br> But never one like that.<br> Oh, Mimi...<br> - Stay where you are.<br> - What?<br> Keep away from me. Now, will you please<br> keep your distance and I'll keep mine.<br> I want you to sit there.<br> What's the matter with it?<br> Now, we're going through with this<br> in a dignified silence.<br> I'd really prefer it.<br> It's warm, isn't it?<br> Do you mind if I recite capitals?<br> - What?<br> - Capitals of states.<br> North Dakota: Bismarck.<br> Wyoming: Cheyenne.<br> Ohio: Columbus.<br> It's lots of fun. I used to do it as a boy.<br> I don't care what you did as a boy.<br> Well, I did nothing as a girl<br> so there goes my childhood.<br> - Oh, Mimi...<br> - Keep your place.<br> Oh, scusi, one moment, please.<br> Give me a name for chance<br> and I am a fool.<br> Captain. Captain!<br> Maybe I'm a mistake.<br> Oh, signora.<br> Fate is a foolish thing<br> to take chances with.<br> So are you.<br> Oh, scusi. You are not the lady.<br> Stay where you are.<br> Oh, Mimi, I mean to say...<br> ...I thought that after the few<br> lovely moments we've had together that...<br> How can you have the impudence<br> to speak of that now?<br> But I suppose it's just the callousness<br> of your kind.<br> - My kind?<br> - Don't think you fooled me for a moment.<br> I knew what you were all along.<br> I knew how you made your living.<br> Oh, I'll admit I'm not proud of it,<br> but I hope to do better someday.<br> And in the meantime<br> it does bring me in a decent income.<br> Some people will do anything for money.<br> It's not as bad as all that.<br> After all, I bring pleasure<br> to thousands of people.<br> Thousands?<br> Yes, tens of thousands.<br> I bring romance to tens of thousands<br> of shop girls, servant girls...<br> ...stenographers.<br> - You might spare me, Mr. Bluebeard.<br> Oh, Mimi, if I would...<br> Are you expecting someone?<br> Why, of course.<br> But not till morning.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Hortense.<br> I better get out of here.<br> I have something very,<br> very important to tell you.<br> Oh, dear, if I only could remember<br> what it was.<br> - It was something about that man.<br> - What man?<br> Oh, yes. Are you sure<br> you have the right one?<br> - Well, he gave me the password.<br> - Well, I met a man downstairs and he said:<br> "Fate is a foolish thing<br> to take chances with." I said, "So are you."<br> Then he said,<br> "You're not the lady."<br> Maybe he said, "You're not a lady."<br> I don't know, my darling.<br> I was so upset I can't be sure.<br> Oh, wouldn't it be too awful<br> if I've made a mistake?<br> Go and ask him.<br> But I'll have to confess<br> that I'm married and why I'm here.<br> Well, don't ask him then,<br> but find out everything you can.<br> But until I'm sure,<br> well, how shall I treat him?<br> Oh, I don't know. Be feminine and sweet,<br> if you can blend the two.<br> I really must go and find Egbert again<br> and tell him all about this.<br> You don't think Egbert is hiding<br> from me, do you?<br> May I run along now?<br> Must you go just yet?<br> Won't you come in<br> and sit down for a while?<br> I didn't do so well in here.<br> Well, of course,<br> if you'd rather stay out there.<br> Guy...<br> ...do you think it was fair<br> not to tell me something of your work?<br> Well, I've been trying to forget about it.<br> Well...<br> ...how did you get started in your career?<br> Oh, I was started by<br> a very well-known actress.<br> And the thousands<br> and thousands came later. I see.<br> Oh, well, in a way, yes.<br> You see, she encouraged me<br> from my very first step.<br> - Very first step?<br> - Yes.<br> Dance step. I'm a dancer by profession.<br> You knew that, of course.<br> Do you mind?<br> Why, no. No, I'm glad.<br> I'm glad.<br> You know, you're the most emotionally<br> unstable girl I've ever met.<br> Scusi, lady. I am fate to take<br> foolish chances with.<br> Tonetti?<br> Tonetti.<br> I cannot find the lady.<br> I give everywhere the passwords,<br> and everywhere I get the slaps.<br> Well, I don't under... Oh, by Jove.<br> I forgot to tell you the lady's name.<br> It's Mrs. Green. She's in room 216.<br> And listen, no more prowling around<br> this hotel like a hyena.<br> And be sure the lady doesn't leave<br> her room before morning.<br> Tonetti, he stays, do and die,<br> until the detective, she arrive.<br> That's right,<br> and when the detectives get...<br> Oh, my word,<br> I forgot all about the detectives.<br> Detectives or no detectives,<br> Tonetti, he gets paid. Tonetti, I am here.<br> Well, I'll rush up to London.<br> I'll bring the detectives<br> first thing in the morning.<br> Oh, dear.<br> - Egbert.<br> - Detectives... What?<br> - Where were you going?<br> - Why? I'm... No. I was just thinking...<br> - Looking for you.<br> - Yes, I've been looking for you.<br> I have something<br> important to tell you.<br> Not now. I've gotta rush to London.<br> No, but I must tell you now.<br> Yes. Well, what is it?<br> What is it? What is it?<br> Well, that's just it.<br> I can't remember what it is.<br> Egbert, you're so tempestuous.<br> You drive everything<br> right out of my head.<br> I'm sorry, but I can't wait.<br> - Well, then I'll go to London with you.<br> - What?<br> And maybe it will come back to me<br> by the time we get there.<br> Besides, you mustn't ride alone at night.<br> I'll bet you say that<br> to every man you marry.<br> - Oh, Egbert.<br> - Oh, well, come along, dear. Come along.<br> Aren't the shadows on the sand lovely?<br> Yes, they are. Lovely.<br> And the light on the water.<br> The edge of the cloud<br> crossing the moon.<br> Look, it's coming out.<br> Look, Guy, it's coming out.<br> It came out.<br> Oh, isn't it beautiful?<br> It's a honey.<br> I wonder what causes<br> that peculiar effect.<br> That's what I'm trying to figure out.<br> Mimi, who is that man<br> that just went into your room?<br> - Man?<br> - I saw a weird-Iooking individual go in there.<br> How many men<br> did you invite here tonight?<br> Mimi, are you married?<br> - What?<br> - Is it your husband?<br> - Husband?<br> - Yes, husb...<br> - Oh, scusi, please, scusi.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> Chances are that fate is foolish.<br> Will you please stay here just a minute?<br> - It's no one.<br> - No one?<br> Mimi, who is it? What's he doing here?<br> Well, he's here on business.<br> Business?<br> - Let's look at the moon.<br> - Not until I throw him out.<br> No, no, no. You mustn't. Oh, you can't.<br> Well, then please tell me who he is.<br> Well, he...<br> - I am married.<br> - You, married?<br> To a geologist.<br> Oh, then it is your husband.<br> Oh, no, no.<br> You see, I'm not really married.<br> That is, I won't be very long.<br> I'm getting a divorce right away...<br> ...and he's here to help me get it.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Mimi, are you the women whose divorce<br> Egbert Fitzgerald is handling?<br> And you thought<br> I was your corespondent?<br> Oh, but now how could you<br> possibly think a thing like that?<br> Well, you said the right words.<br> What right words?<br> Oh, scusi, please, scusi.<br> Fate is the foolish thing. Take a chance.<br> Are you the corespondent?<br> Rudolfo Tonetti, at your service.<br> - You are no longer needed.<br> - What?<br> I am taking your place.<br> Are you a union man?<br> Are you hired by Mr. Egbert too?<br> Oh, Mr. Tonetti, you don't understand.<br> This gentleman isn't to take your place.<br> He isn't going to stay.<br> - Then you need me.<br> - Nothing of the kind. You're intruding.<br> - Get out of here.<br> - But, Guy...<br> Think I'm gonna leave you with an Italian?<br> He might be a tenor.<br> Listen.<br> I was wrong.<br> - I'm gonna throw him out.<br> - Oh, but, Guy.<br> But I have a contract<br> and I sue for damages.<br> First for my ear, second for my honor...<br> ...and third...<br> - Quiet, please, both of you.<br> This is my affair. I'm here for a divorce,<br> and Mr. Tonetti must stay.<br> Well, if he stays, I stay.<br> I feel crowded, but that's life.<br> At last my call, she come.<br> Scusi, please. I answer.<br> Hello? Oh, hello, hello, Maria.<br> Six times I call you and you are busy.<br> Gives always:<br> Yes, the busy signal.<br> Yes, yes, I'm all right.<br> No, blond.<br> Just a blond.<br> Scusi, signora, but I talk to the wife.<br> She want to know all about the lady.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, kiss the kiddies for me.<br> What?<br> What? Maria.<br> Maria, who is that speaking to you?<br> What?<br> What do you think?<br> My little son Rodolfo only 9 years old<br> and already his voice is changing.<br> Good night, sweetheart.<br> You stay, you do not stay.<br> Tonetti does not care.<br> But no monkey business.<br> And the lady must not leave the room<br> while Tonetti is on the case.<br> You mean we're prisoners?<br> You don't think I'm going<br> to take the lady away?<br> - I will see that you do not.<br> - That's awfully nice of you.<br> Oh, scusi, maybe you like to play<br> some three-handed bridge?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - No?<br> Not a bit.<br> All right, then I go inside<br> and play some solitaire.<br> And please remember not to leave.<br> I watch.<br> - Guy, I don't wanna drag you into this.<br> - But I wanna be in it. And from now on.<br> You know, I don't think it's gonna be<br> so bad being kept prisoner here.<br> Hello, hello.<br> That doesn't sound<br> like the prisoners' song to me.<br> That's not a bad tune.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's the newest thing here.<br> - It's called the Continental.<br> - The Continental?<br> I like it.<br> That's the second thing I've found<br> I'd like to take back home with me.<br> Do you know the words?<br> It's beautiful music<br> Dangerous rhythm<br> It's something daring<br> The Continental<br> A way of dancing<br> That's really ultra new<br> It's very subtle<br> The Continental<br> Because it does<br> What you want it to do<br> It has a passion<br> The Continental<br> An invitation<br> To moonlight and romance<br> It's quite the fashion<br> The Continental<br> Because you tell of your love<br> While you dance<br> Your lips whisper so tenderly<br> Her eyes answer your song<br> Two bodies swaying<br> The Continental<br> And you are saying<br> Just what you're dreaming of<br> So keep on dancing<br> The Continental<br> For it's a song of romance<br> And of love<br> You kiss<br> While you're dancing<br> That's not a bad idea.<br> It's Continental<br> It's Continental<br> You sing<br> While you're dancing<br> Your voice is gentle<br> And sentimental<br> You stroll together<br> Arm in arm<br> You nonchalantly glide along<br> With grace and charm<br> You will find<br> While you're dancing<br> That there's a rhythm<br> In your heart and soul<br> A certain rhythm<br> That you can't control<br> And you will do the Continental<br> All the time<br> Oh, can't we go down there<br> and join the fun?<br> But what if our jailer should catch us?<br> I forgot all about "scusi, please."<br> What is it?<br> An idea, an idea.<br> Is this one of those?<br> I think I know how we can get out of here<br> without our friend Tonetti missing us.<br> This is something<br> I used to do as a boy.<br> - I don't care what you did as a boy.<br> - "What you did as a boy." I know.<br> This might work, though.<br> Look, you've got me<br> cutting out paper dolls.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Well, I'll go change.<br> - That's cute.<br> - That's beautiful.<br> Come on.<br> Look, Mimi.

Come on.<br> - Now, why did you do this?<br> - I wanted to be sure of you.<br> - Who is this?<br> - How do I know?<br> This isn't my racket. You've been<br> through these things before.<br> I know, but you've upset<br> my entire routine.<br> - Find out who it is.<br> - Yes.<br> - Who is it?<br> - It's the waiter, sir.<br> - It's the waiter.<br> - Ask him what he wants.<br> - What do you want?<br> - Breakfast.<br> Breakfast. What shall we do?<br> Give him his breakfast.<br> No, wait a minute.<br> - Oh, Mimi. Oh, Mimi.<br> - Yes?<br> There's a waiter<br> who says he wants breakfast.<br> - What?<br> - That's what he says.<br> The poor fellow may be hungry.<br> Clown. That's our breakfast.<br> I just ordered it.<br> - That's our breakfast, Tonetti.<br> - I open it.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Did you rest comfortably?<br> - Oh, yes, indeed.<br> - Put that right here.<br> - Yes. May I?<br> - Mr. Tonetti, you sit there.<br> - Thank you.<br> And, Guy, you sit there.<br> You know, I'd like to have breakfast<br> with you every morning.<br> Yes? Thank you.<br> I hope you like what I ordered.<br> You know, I've never had breakfast<br> with two gentlemen before.<br> I've tried it. It's no fun.<br> Now, now, when the detectives arrive,<br> we must be very careful.<br> Oh, I hope they don't arrive too soon.<br> I've grown to like<br> both of you tremendously.<br> That's so sweet.<br> - Guy. Guy, you'd better hide.<br> - Let Tonetti hide.<br> She's right. You'll ruin all. Go.<br> Guy, please.<br> You want me to be free, don't you?<br> - I'll hide, but call if you need me.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> Go ahead.<br> - No, not over here.<br> - Where?<br> Over there. Anywhere. Just stay...<br> Coffee, ma'am.<br> I thought it best to keep it hot for you.<br> - Guy.<br> - Yes, dear.<br> It's all right. It's just the waiter<br> with the coffee.<br> Waiter, next time you knock,<br> let's have some sort of signal.<br> Like this, will you?<br> I can't be dashing in and out,<br> coffee or no coffee.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Knock each time.<br> - I understand.<br> - Yes, you see, that's it.<br> Tell me, the gentleman in this case<br> is a scientist, is he not?<br> A very distinguished scientist<br> in his own field.<br> A fossil among fossils. A geologist.<br> - Pardon, but are you discussing geology?<br> - Always and again.<br> If you'll excuse me, sir,<br> I have an unnatural passion for rocks.<br> Well, you ought<br> to be ashamed of yourself.<br> Oh, no, sir,<br> it's a wonderful thing, geology, sir.<br> Do you know, geologically speaking,<br> this little island of Great Britain...<br> ...is 500 million<br> and 3 and one-half years old?<br> How do you know it's exactly that old?<br> Professor Brown told me it was<br> ...and that was<br> three and a half years ago.<br> - Who was that?<br> - Professor Brown.<br> - Professor Brown?<br> - Yes. He's a geologist.<br> Him and his wife stopped<br> at the last place I worked.<br> Do you know, sir,<br> it was Professor Brown who told me...<br> ...that this seacoast around here<br> is really an igneous intrusion?<br> You know, you're somewhat<br> of an igneous intrusion yourself.<br> Oh, thank you, sir.<br> Now, to return to the facts, we...<br> Is that the way<br> you want me to knock, sir?<br> - Yes, thank you. Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> I see. Thank you very much.<br> Oh, what a day this is going to be.<br> - Well, Mrs. Glossop.<br> - Hello, Egbert.<br> Quiet, pl...<br> Oh, Guy, what are you doing here?<br> Oh, Egbert, that's what I've been trying<br> to remember to tell you about.<br> - Oh, was it?<br> - Yes.<br> This is my Mimi.<br> Oh, really? Yes. Well, this is my finish.<br> - Tonetti, if you have bungled this job...<br> - Now, scusi, signor, please, scusi.<br> Now, Guy, get out.<br> You're messing up the whole thing.<br> - You brought the detectives?<br> - Better than that.<br> I've pulled a supreme coup.<br> A masterpiece.<br> I'll bet this will be good.<br> I have brought Mr. Glossop.<br> - My husband?<br> - Yes.<br> The husband is coming.<br> Shut up, Guy. You've got to get out.<br> - No more hiding.<br> - Oh, please, Guy. You promised.<br> All right, I'll hide.<br> But please call if you need me.<br> - Call anyhow.<br> - Yes, I will.<br> Mimi, it was my idea to have your<br> husband here. Wasn't it clever of me?<br> Oh, Hortense, why did you do that?<br> Something terrible is liable to happen.<br> - Courage, I don't think he'll shoot.<br> - Shoot?<br> Is somebody going to shoot? Let's wait.<br> Shoot? Mr. Egbert, never, never have I had<br> to come in contact with a husband before.<br> I don't think it's fair to ask me to do so<br> now. Where are the detectives?<br> I demand the detectives.<br> It's in my contract.<br> I'm sorry. I can't do anything about that.<br> He's probably on his way up.<br> Do something. Do something.<br> Look amorous. Tonetti, look amorous.<br> Hortense, look... Never mind.<br> - Come on, come on.<br> - Yes, Egbert.<br> Well, this is too much for Tonetti.<br> Quick, quick. What shall we do?<br> Well, Mr. Egbert said try<br> to look amorous. See, like this:<br> Oh, you just look sick.<br> Well, try this:<br> Come in.<br> Pardon, madam,<br> I hope I knocked the right way.<br> - Now you've spoiled everything.<br> - I'm sorry, sir. I came for the dishes.<br> Oh, well, the dishes can wait.<br> - Can't we do something with him?<br> - Yes, here.<br> - Go quickly there, please.<br> - Yes, hide him.<br> - In the bedroom?<br> - Yes. Hurry. Hurry.<br> - Yes, hurry.<br> - Oh, now, sir, please...<br> - Hi, waiter.<br> - How do you do, sir?<br> - You hiding too?<br> - Yes, sir. They just shoved me in here.<br> Now, once more.<br> Come in.<br> Oh, Cyril.<br> Who is this fellow?<br> This is my husband.<br> Oh, how do you do?<br> I'm so very pleased.<br> You haven't answered my question.<br> I must confess, he's my...<br> This object?<br> No, I don't believe it.<br> My dear child, he's nothing to you.<br> He has all the earmarks<br> of a hired corespondent.<br> That is not true.<br> She love me and I love she.<br> Mimi, you amuse me.<br> I'd never believe it with him.<br> This...? This hairdresser?<br> Guy! Guy!<br> I'm sorry to ask you to do this,<br> but will you kiss me?<br> I'm not sorry.<br> Bravo. Bravissimo.<br> And who, pray, is this new Lothario?<br> After the divorce,<br> we're going to be married.<br> What divorce?<br> Why, aren't you going to divorce me?<br> Why, no, my dear.<br> I'm going to forgive you.<br> Forgive her.<br> Enough of this nonsense.<br> Mimi, you pack up your things<br> and come home at once.<br> At once, I tell you.<br> Why, you're just a little lamb who's strayed.<br> And you, sir,<br> are just an ineffectual little puppy.<br> At last, I've got my chance<br> to throw somebody out.<br> Oh, no, no, Guy.<br> You mustn't, please.<br> Pardon me, ma'am.<br> May I go now? I've got my work to do.<br> Yes, yes, go ahead.<br> Why, how do you do, Professor Brown?<br> Professor Brown?<br> How are you, professor,<br> if you don't mind my asking?<br> Oh, is this your dear old friend,<br> the rock thrower?<br> Yes, sir, that's him.<br> That's ridiculous.<br> He doesn't know what he's talking about.<br> - I never saw this man in my life.<br> - Oh, come, professor.<br> Don't you remember all those little chats<br> we used to have about rocks?<br> You and me and your wife?<br> No, I do not.<br> And would you know<br> the professor's wife if you saw her?<br> Why, of course I would, sir.<br> Am I Mrs. Brown?<br> No, ma'am. You're Mrs. Green.<br> Well, strike me pink.<br> You see, Mrs. Brown, she was French.<br> She couldn't speak a word of English.<br> Why, Buster Brown,<br> this is most "unfossilish" of you, sir.<br> I've got to catch a train.<br> - Let me pass, sir.<br> - I will not, sir.<br> - Let me pass, I say.<br> - Never, sir.<br> Well, well, what happened? Did it work?<br> Did it work?<br> Meet the future Mrs. Holden.<br> Oh, now... Oh, I told you.<br> I told you.<br> Father will be so proud of me.<br> - Egbert and I are going to be married too.<br> - Yes.<br> Why, darling, why, what's the mat...?<br> We were married last night,<br> on our way back from London.<br> Last night? Were we?<br> Why, of course, sir, we were.<br> Darling, I'd forgotten about it.<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> I'll tell you what we'll do.<br> We'll hurry back to London<br> to have a celebration.<br> Oh, scusi, scusi, I'm also very good<br> at parties.<br> SiRiUs sHaRe SyNc:<br> Radu108<br>
