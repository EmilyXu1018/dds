Perhaps youve heard of him?<br> Yes, yes. Of course.<br> Hed like to speak to you<br> about a private matter.<br> This is..uh..<br> an awkward moment---<br> Im sorry. Im about to sit down to<br> Christmas dinner myself.<br> No, thats not exactly what I mean.<br> Youre referring to your recent<br> legal problems.<br> That has provided us with much ammusement.<br> Herr Vanger has little love<br> for Wennerstrom either.<br> Have him call me.<br> But, hed like to meet in person,<br> If possible.<br> Up north. In Hedestad.<br> That's not gonna be possible.<br> Herr Vanger is far too old to make a trip to<br> Stockholm,<br> Please.<br> If youd be so kind as to consider.<br> Hedestad is lovely in winter.<br> I'll call you back on this number.<br> Okay?<br> Usually when I wake up in a cold<br> bed, its at home.<br> - I'm Sorry.<br> - What are you doing?<br> Writing the press release.<br> Saying...<br> Youre taking over as publisher.<br> Youre sorry for any nuisance<br> Wennerstrom was caused.<br> I cant be<br> reached for comment.<br> - Are you giving up?<br> - Just stepping aside.<br> This makes me sick.<br> - FRODE: First time in Hedestad?<br> - And the last.<br> Oh, don't say that.<br> Its lovely in the spring.<br> You said it was lovely<br> in winter.<br> Well, this is unseasonable.<br> Ill be on the 4:30 train back to<br> Stockholm.<br> Unless we get snowed in ...<br> Im joking.<br> Youll be home tonight,<br> if thats what you wish.<br> Welcome. Come inside.<br> Its warm.<br> How do you do?<br> So...<br> What do you know about me?<br> That you used to run one of the<br> biggest industrial firms in the country.<br> - Used to. Thats correct.<br> - Right, I didn't mean to...<br> My grandfather forged the tracks<br> the 4:30 train will take you home.<br> We stitched this country together.<br> We made the steel--<br> and milled the lumber that built<br> modern Sweden.<br> And what our most profitable<br> product now is?<br> Fertilizer.<br> Im not obsessed with the declining<br> health of the company,<br> but I am with<br> the settling of accounts -<br> and the clock is ticking.<br> I need your help.<br> Doing..doing what?<br> Officially, assisting me with my memoirs.<br> But what youd really be doing..<br> is solving a mystery. And<br> by doing what you do so well -<br> Your recent legal mishap of<br> yours notwithstanding.<br> Youd be investigating<br> thieves, misers, bullies,<br> - the most detestable collection<br> of people youll ever meet ...<br> my family.<br> Would you like to sit? I could<br> possibly clear a place if necessary.<br> - Did you make it?<br> - Have you something for me?<br> Im on welfare;<br> I dont administer it.<br> This isnt enough.<br> No thank you?<br> This is Harriet. The grandaughter<br> of my brother Richard.<br> Richard, was a<br> Nazi of the first order -<br> joining the<br> - Nationalist Socialist Freedom League<br> when he was 17.<br> Isnt it interesting how fascists<br> always steal the word freedom "freedom".<br> The 4:30. Yes.<br> Okay...<br> Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi<br> cause -<br> in 1940, missed all the real<br> excitement -<br> but not the opportunity<br> to regularly beat his wife Margareta..<br> and their son, Gottfried.<br> Now, Gottfried - Harriets father -<br> was what people used to call<br> - a Good-Time-Charlie.<br> - Theyre still called that.<br> Are they? Okay.<br> He was a charmer, a ladies man,<br> a drunk.<br> In other words, a born salesman -<br> which is what he did for the company -<br> traveling around, taking clients<br> out to dinner and so forth.<br> - Well, Somebody has to do it.<br> - Thats right.<br> Anyway, he died in 1965.<br> Drowned. Drunk.<br> Here on theisland.<br> His wife Isabella - who was pretty<br> much useless as a parent before -<br> became even more so after his death -<br> which is when I began looking after<br> their children -<br> Martin - who runs Vanger Industries<br> now that Im retired -<br> - I've been with him.<br> - and Harriet.<br> She was bright and curious,<br> a winning combination in any person.<br> - And beautiful.<br> - Yeah.<br> Something happened to her?<br> Someone in the family<br> murdered Harriet.<br> And for the last forty years<br> has been trying to drive me insane.<br> It was September 24th, 1966.<br> A Saturday.<br> Harriet was 16.<br> My brothers - along with their<br> wives, children and grandchildren -<br> had gathered here<br> for our loathsome<br> annual board meeting and dinner.<br> It was also the day the Yacht Club held<br> its Autumn parade.<br> Harriet and a couple of school<br> friends had gone into town to see it.<br> She returned a<br> little after two oclock.<br> She came to the parlor.<br> She asked if she could talk to me.<br> I honestly<br> dont remember what I was doing<br> that I thought was more important, but I<br> told her to give me a few minutes.<br> It was during those few minutes,<br> that something else occurred.<br> The accident had<br> nothing to do with Harriet -<br> and yet, everything.<br> It was chaos as everyone put down<br> what they were doing.<br> Police, an ambulance,<br> fire brigade,<br> reporter, photographer and onlookers<br> quickly arrived from town,<br> just as those of us on the island - the family -<br> hurried to the bridge from our side.<br> The driver of the car -<br> a man named Aronsson -<br> was pinned and severely injured.<br> We tried desperately to pry him out<br> with our hands - since metal tools could spark.<br> It was an hour after the crash,<br> Harriet was in the kitchen.<br> Anna herself saw her.<br> We finally got poor<br> Aronsson out of his car<br> and off to the hospital,<br> Just us we from our side<br> slowly drifted back to the house.<br> The sun was down,<br> the excitement over,<br> we sat down to dinner.<br> It was then, that<br> I noticed Harriet wasnt there.<br> And she wasnt there the next<br> morning. Or the next.<br> Or the next forty years.<br> What was she going to tell me? Why<br> didnt I make time for her?<br> Why didnt I listen?<br> - And she couldnt have run away?<br> - Not without being seen.<br> Firemen stayed<br> on the bridge all night<br> pumping out the gasoline.<br> And no one swam across,<br> or took a row boat.<br> All of them were still tied up<br> on this side Sunday.<br> Believe me,<br> I checked.<br> She couldnt have just<br> fallen and drowned?<br> Oh, no. The currents<br> arent strong here.<br> Anything that falls into the water<br> turns up nearby.<br> Like her father.<br> His body didnt drift more<br> than ten meters<br> when he drowned<br> the year before.<br> No. No. Someone killed her,<br> Someone on the island<br> that day.<br> Someone close enough to know<br> what she used to give me each year<br> on my birthday.<br> Those were from her.<br> The rest...from her killer.<br> - Who knows about these?<br> - Just me, the police, the killer...<br> and now you.<br> After, the police investigation evaporated,<br> I kept at it -<br> studying all the information there was,<br> Ive spent half my life<br> examining the events of a single day.<br> I understand your frustration, But...<br> what youre asking me to do is<br> a waste of money<br> We havent discussed your fee.<br> We dont need to.<br> Thank you.<br> I cant find something you havent<br> been able to in forty years.<br> You dont know that.<br> You have a<br> very keen investigative mind.<br> Heres what I propose:<br> You come stay on the island. I have a nice little<br> cottage by the water you can use.<br> You study the material I give you.<br> You find something Ive missed- or you dont.<br> What you're asking me to do<br> is set aside my life and career....<br> Think of it as a well<br> deserved holiday.<br> A way of avoiding all the<br> people you want to avoid right now.<br> As for compensation, Ill pay you double<br> your salary for as many months as it takes.<br> Ill quadruple it if<br> you solve the mystery.<br> - Herr Vanger.<br> - Im not done.<br> Ill throw in one more thing -<br> even though youre a<br> terrible negotiator.<br> Its something you want more than anything else<br> and it cant be bought at any price.<br> So, let me give it to you ...<br> Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.<br> He began his career working for me.<br> And Ive followed it with interest,<br> shall we say, ever since.<br> You were right about him.<br> You just couldnt prove it.<br> Were in the middle of our worst crisis ever<br> and youre writing a memoir?<br> You fired me;<br> I need something to do.<br> You fired you;<br> I need you here,<br> not the North Pole.<br> Mikael, You know what this<br> is going to look like.<br> Like Ive been gutted. Like Im<br> running away. I am.<br> Wennerstrm wants to see me waving<br> a white flag, not a red one.<br> The more it looks like theres a problem<br> between you and me, the more itll satisfy him.<br> There is a problem between us. He<br> wont be satisfied until he shuts us down,<br> Youre leaving me to fight him alone?<br> Its four hours by train.<br> Its not the North Pole.<br> Hey, hey.<br> The network is busy,<br> please try again later.<br> The network is busy,<br> please try again later.<br> What?<br> Want some Milk?<br> The network is busy,<br> please try again later.<br> You are Palmgren's daughter?<br> His ward,<br> He doesn't have a daughter.<br> Please.<br> He's had a severe<br> cerebral hemorrhaging.<br> Either from the fall itself,<br> or a stroke that led to the fall.<br> His blood pressure is too high.<br> Im hopeful hell regain consciousness,<br> but thats not assured.<br> And its possible, even if he does,<br> there will be<br> neurological damage.<br> Hi, Im Gunner.<br> The caretaker.<br> Oh, hey, Gunnar.<br> Youre an author?<br> Well, I'm doing a biography<br> on Herr Vanger.<br> - I saw you on television.<br> - Thats unfortunate.<br> Bit of trouble, I guess.<br> No jail time, though.<br> Thats good.<br> Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?<br> There.<br> It's good.<br> The entire island is<br> owned by my family.<br> Your closest neighbor is<br> my brother<br> Harald, another Nazi if you can believe.<br> Two in the family.<br> Oh, yes. Hes quite detestable<br> to put it nicely,<br> but youll probably never see him.<br> Hes a recluse.<br> - He was there that day?<br> - Indeed, he was.<br> His daughter, Cecilia,<br> lives over there.<br> They dont speak.<br> Does anyone speak to<br> anyone on this island?<br> Isabella, Harriets mother<br> - who lives there - she speaks to Harald -<br> which is one of reasons<br> I dont speak to her<br> Cecilias brother Birger<br> lives there.<br> - Who doesnt he speak to?<br> - You, probably.<br> Not that youd want him to.<br> He can be as unpleasant as Harald.<br> Im quickly losing<br> track of whos who, here.<br> Oh, how youll wish<br> it were always so.<br> Soon youll know us all only too<br> well - with my apologies.<br> Out there is my nephew Martins<br> house; Harriets brother.<br> - Who speaks to him?<br> - I speak to him.<br> He runs the company<br> now, as I think I told you.<br> Someone shooting their dinner.<br> Gunner probably.<br> Oh yes, I met him earlier.<br> He was 19 when<br> Harriet disappeared.<br> He lives over there.<br> - And you live there?<br> - Sorry?<br> Your house.<br> Oh, yes!<br> Yes, youre right.<br> The man who hires the detective should<br> always bekept on the suspects list.<br> I never found a body was not surprising.<br> You cant dig up an entire island.<br> But neither could I find the motive.<br> Was it spontaneous? Was it calculated?<br> Did she know something someone<br> wished she didnt?<br> - Was it about business?<br> - Business? But she was sixteen.<br> And very bright.<br> Henrik told me he could easily see her<br> running the business one day,<br> She was with some friends that day.<br> At a parade.<br> She told them she was feeling unwell.<br> She left early<br> But they also told me<br> she kept secrets from them, too.<br> The main thing I learned was that<br> teenage girls are complicated.<br> - I have one.<br> - Then, you know.<br> I wanted to...<br> Ask you about this.<br> She received that from Henrik,<br> the Christmas before.<br> I studied it more times<br> than I can say.<br> - I know every page of it.<br> - The last page Im curious about.<br> As was I.<br> List of Names, Numbers and..<br> Must have some significance.<br> Theyre local phone numbers.<br> The first belonged to a woman<br> called Margot,<br> whose mother was Magda,<br> who denied she didnt know Harriet.<br> The fourth, R.L., belonged to<br> Rosemarie Larsson,<br> an elderly woman who died<br> some years before.<br> The other three were not connected<br> in any way that I could find.<br> Ive reminded you of things youd<br> rather forget. Im sorry.<br> I cant forget it.<br> Its my "Rebecka Case".<br> I don't know what that is.<br> Every policeman has at least<br> one unsolved case to obsess over.<br> Back then we had an Officer,<br> Torstensson.<br> Year after year he kept<br> going back to his "Rebecka Case".<br> taking out the files -<br> studying them over and over.<br> We were young, we laughed at him.<br> That was also a missing girl case?<br> No, no, no. Thats not why I mention it.<br> I'm talking about the soul<br> of a policeman.<br> Poor old Torstensson never solved it,<br> and he never let it go.<br> Hows Mr. Palmgren doing?<br> I heard he had a stroke of some kind?<br> That's Terrible.<br> What exactly do you do at this<br> security company?<br> Make coffee and sort mail.<br> But not full-time.<br> Not even part-time consistently.<br> They somehow got<br> along without coffee or mail<br> in July and August?<br> - How much did you made there?<br> - Enough.<br> - How much is your rent?<br> - I pay my rent.<br> And when was the last time you were late?<br> Never.<br> Do you think that ring in your eyelid<br> makes you attractive?<br> Heres the problem.<br> There a discrepancy..<br> between the obligation of<br> Mr. Palmgrens guardianship<br> and the management of your finances.<br> There's no discrepancy or a problem.<br> It was clear to him<br> I could manage myown finances.<br> - But thats not clear to me.<br> - Im not a child.<br> No. Youre not.<br> But you were.<br> And between then and now -<br> you're committed to a ward at St. Stephens,<br> where you continued to display<br> a violent aggression -<br> And you failed to adapt to four foster homes<br> arrested twice for intoxication,<br> twice for narcotics<br> again for an assault: smashing<br> a bottle smashed into a mans face.<br> And that's not even that long ago.<br> You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into<br> thinking youve changed, but<br> looking at this...<br> - not to mention how youre looking<br> at me now -<br> I don't think you have.<br> So the Good<br> -Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are over.<br> Starting now, youll be given a monthly allowance.<br> Youll provide me with receipts for your expenses.<br> If the numbers dont balance, Ill<br> have to assume the difference is going to drugs.<br> Ive been on myself<br> since I was ten.<br> The State- has taken care of you.<br> Ms. Salander? Please look at me.<br> Because this is important.<br> Since, behavior youre displaying<br> right now is elaborately documented here -<br> - so it would come as a shock to no<br> one if I chose an alternative to<br> very lenient arrangement<br> I've just outlined.<br> Would you prefer<br> institutionalization?<br> - Mikael?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm Liv.<br> - Hi.<br> Were going to the same place.<br> Hop in.<br> Okay, thank you.<br> I found him at deaths door<br> halfway up the hill.<br> Im afraid Im a bit out of shape.<br> No, its a climb for anyone.<br> I shouldve warned you.<br> - Come on in.<br> - Thank you, Martin.<br> Henrik says great things about you.<br> What a place,<br> look at that view!<br> I used to work in the companys<br> petrochemical division in Goteborg.<br> When it was sold, I went with it.<br> A dark day.<br> I live in Hong Kong now, but come<br> back to Stockholm for family events,<br> and when I do, I drive up to spend a<br> couple days with Martin.<br> - She comes for the moose steak.<br> - You can't blame her, it's wonderful.<br> Something let's open.<br> Would you like to try something<br> else?<br> No, no, no.<br> It's fine.<br> Youre writing a book now,<br> What is it?<br> - Henriks biography.<br> - I love Henrik.<br> Hes fascinating.<br> Martin, too.<br> Together theyre the<br> Old Sweden and the New.<br> They are.<br> You know about Harriet, right?<br> - You dont?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> The family doesnt like<br> to talk about it,<br> but it cant just be<br> swept under the rug.<br> - What cant.<br> - Harriet.<br> - We can talk about that later.<br> - No.<br> We can talk about it now.<br> Liv knows everything about<br> my crazyfamily.<br> - Which is why shell never marry me.<br> - Thats one reason...<br> I don't wanna read about that<br> in the book.<br> Everything else is fine,<br> Harriet certainly.<br> Everything changed after that.<br> Not just the family,<br> but the company as well.<br> - How so?<br> - Were not Nordea or Ericsson,<br> but were still the largest family-owned<br> company in the country.<br> At the height, we had 40,000 employees.<br> We have about half that now,<br> and that downward slide -<br> began after my sisters death.<br> It broke Henriks entrepreneurial spirit,<br> and his heart.<br> You were here that day?<br> I came in a little late, after the accident<br> on the bridge. The 4:30 train.<br> I know it well.<br> It was a terrible day.<br> And the days after -<br> searching and not finding her<br> - were even worse.<br> This event, Mikael, has to be a<br> big part of your book.<br> I got a call from social welfare.<br> Ive been on to find a new guardian.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello.<br> I thought Id come over<br> and say hello.<br> - Im Cecilia.<br> - Oh, yeah. Please, come in.<br> Some coffee?<br> No, Thank you.<br> Were all uncomfortable with the<br> idea of a chronicle of our family.<br> Its not about the family.<br> Its about Henrik and the company.<br> Like I said...<br> Its not my intention to present a<br> malicious portrait of anyone.<br> Unlike the one<br> that landed you in court.?<br> Unlike that one. Yes.<br> So, what youre saying is, youre not really here<br> to look into what happened to Harriet?<br> I cant ignore such<br> a dramatic event,<br> but no, thats not<br> by any means my focus.<br> All those boxes Gunner carted down here<br> - which are where? - in the closet now?<br> - those werent Henriks<br> private investigation?<br> I wonder sometimes whos crazier -<br> my Nazi father<br> or my obsessed uncle.<br> Since were talking about it,<br> since you brought it up, what was she like?<br> Im sure Henrik has told you.<br> He was my age back then, he couldnt know<br> what was going on<br> with a teenager,<br> anymore than I can with my own daughter.<br> - You were the same age.<br> - Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age.<br> She knew Harriet better than anyone -<br> You should talk to her.<br> Id love to, where is she?<br> If I had to guess -<br> London.<br> - You dont know where your own sister lives?<br> - I havent seen her in years.<br> - We never really got along.<br> - Im getting used to that comment.<br> She hates this place<br> even more than I do.<br> She left, moved to London,<br> That was it.<br> You couldnt pay her to send a Christmas card,<br> much less visit.<br> Ill try to track and help you.<br> If you do,<br> and try talking to her about us,<br> dont be surprised<br> if she tells you to fuck off.<br> You backed up?<br> - Hard drives at home, yeah.<br> - Thats good. B'cos this one is gone.<br> Have you ever had an STD?<br> Whens the last time<br> you were tested for HIV?<br> How many partners have you had<br> in thelast month?<br> How many of those were men?<br> It's regulation,<br> I have to ask you these things.<br> - Its a matter of health.<br> - Write what you want.<br> Why do you need<br> such an expensive computer?<br> - For work.<br> - Making coffee and sorting mail ?<br> I shouldnt even have to ask.<br> I should have control of my money.<br> And you will.<br> Once you learn to be sociable.<br> Get along with people.<br> Can you do that?<br> Why don't we start with that?<br> Why don't we start with me?<br> You do something for me,<br> I do something for you.<br> Thats how normal people do.<br> I want you to have that computer.<br> You feel that?<br> Thats gaberdine.<br> Unzip it.<br> And ...<br> And ...<br> I like the reticence.<br> Its almost convincing.<br> - Anita Vanger?<br> - Through there.<br> Thank you.<br> Excuse me.<br> I probably should have made an appointment.<br> No, Its fine.<br> - Please.

Did I miss something?<br> Were talking about an<br> investment in the magazine.<br> I gather that.<br> Why would you want to do that?<br> Well, not out of greed,<br> thats for sure.<br> I feel badly that Ive taken Mikael<br> away from you at the worst possible time.<br> Now i'm convinced that this is<br> the right thing to do. The moral thing..<br> Thats one reason.<br> And.<br> And....<br> The enemies of my friends<br> are my enemies.<br> How long have you<br> been discussing this with them?<br> I havent been.

Did I drag you in? No.<br> All I had to do was..<br> offered you a drink.<br> Youd never think the fear of offending<br> can be stronger<br> than the fear of pain -<br> but you know what?<br> It is.<br> They always come willingly.<br> And then they sit here.<br> They know its over like..<br> you do - But somehow..<br> they still think<br> they have a chance.<br> Maybe if I say the right thing -<br> Maybe if Im polite -<br> or I cry and beg - "<br> when I see the hope draining<br> from their face like it is<br> from yours right now -<br> I feel myself...<br> getting hard.<br> We are not that different,<br> You and I.<br> We both have urges.<br> Satisfying mine,<br> requires more towels.<br> It might amuse you to know that while you<br> were upstairs having mousse with me and Liv -<br> who, by the way,<br> finds me very conventional -<br> I had Irina was down here<br> in the cage.<br> Whos Irina, you might ask?<br> Just another girl.<br> Just another immigrant whore.<br> Who misses them?<br> - Your sister wasnt.<br> - What?<br> Your sister, Harriet,<br> wasnt just another girl.<br> You found her?<br> What happened to her?<br> You killed her.<br> You useless fuckin detective.<br> Is that too tight to talk?<br> Good.<br> Im tired of talking to you.<br> Ive never had a man in<br> here, before.<br> In fact, Ive never touched a man.<br> Except my father.<br> But it was our duty.<br> Harriets and Mine.<br> There's a gun in the television.<br> May I kill him?<br> How come a 23 years old<br> can be a ward of the state?<br> Im mentally incompetent<br> and cant manage daily life.<br> - Since when have they said that?<br> - Since I was twelve.<br> Something happened<br> when you were twelve?<br> I'm sorry,<br> That's none of my business.<br> I tried to kill my father.<br> I burned him alive.<br> Got about 80 percent of him.<br> I'll make some coffee.<br> - Who is it?<br> - It's Harriet.<br> I found it in Martin's basement.<br> Among his souverneers.<br> Martin didnt deny killing anyone.<br> But when I mentioned Harriet,<br> he was confused.<br> He was angry - at me - b'cos<br> I couldn't tell him what happened to her.<br> He didnt kill her.<br> And his father didn't do it.<br> He was dead the year before.<br> What if she did somehow get away?<br> And if...<br> she's still alive?<br> Theres only one person in this family<br> who would know where she is.<br> Fuck me, fuck me.<br> Your turn.<br> Right.<br> Yeah.<br> Hi.<br> - I'm Sorry to bother you.<br> - What do you want?<br> - No ones called you?<br> - About?<br> Your cousin, Martin.<br> What about him?<br> He died in a car accidentlast Thursday.<br> There's going to be a memorial...<br> Im not interested in any memorial.<br> - I understand.<br> - What do you understand.?<br> That you dont care<br> very much of your relatives.<br> - I just, thought you should know.<br> - Now, I know.<br> Howd it go?<br> - Okay. I think.<br> - Shes on.<br> And she's shopping.<br> Shes playing solitaire?<br> - And she still hasnt called anyone?<br> - No.<br> Do we have her cell phone, too?<br> I was so shed lead us to her.<br> Put your hand back in my shirt.<br> Theres only one reason she<br> hasnt call Harriet.<br> She cant,<br> because Harriet is dead.<br> - I was just thinking. What if -...<br> - Just one second.<br> What were you going to say?<br> I was just thinking, there could be<br> one other possibility.<br> - What is it now?<br> - Before he died,<br> your brother hung me<br> from a hook ...<br> Harriet.<br> - So you send the flowers?<br> - Yes.<br> We found in the Swedish General Registry,<br> Annita was married.<br> But the family never knew,<br> did they?<br> So, Im guessing she then came here<br> on a married name passport<br> you followed on her<br> maiden name passport.<br> No, Actually, it was the other way around.<br> She thought that it safer for me<br> to travel with Spencer myself.<br> What did he think about that?<br> Nothing. Only that he loved her.<br> She said, If you love me, youll do<br> this and not ask why.<br> He never did.<br> And they both died twenty years ago.<br> A car accident.<br> You found that, too.<br> Is that you?<br> I was 14 the first time he raped me.<br> - Martin?<br> - No, my father.<br> Martin only started,<br> after he died.<br> Why didnt you tell someone?<br> I did. My mother.<br> Henrik would have done something.<br> I almost told him. But I was afraid<br> because of what I've done.<br> I uh...<br> You still dont understand, Do you?<br> A year after the first time -<br> There were many times<br> during that year -<br> my father got drunker<br> than usual one night<br> and started bragging...<br> about women hed killed.<br> He quoted from the Bible<br> as he tore off my clothes.<br> He tiedd a belt around my neck.<br> He<br> wanted to kill me.<br> I uh...<br> I made it out of the house and<br> I went down to the dock.<br> He came staggering<br> after me -<br> I could never fight him off<br> in a small space,<br> but out in the open..<br> I was strong enough to deal<br> with an old drunk.<br> When it was over...<br> I looked up, Martin was standing there -<br> looking at me.<br> All Id accomplished was<br> substitute one for another.<br> A couple months later, Henrik sent<br> Martin to school in Uppsala.<br> And I thought maybe -<br> just maybe - the nightmare was finally over.<br> And then I saw him.<br> across the street -<br> And I knew..<br> It would never be over.<br> Howd you escaped?<br> Annita...<br> She insisted that I leave<br> everything behind.<br> If I took anything, the police<br> might've suspected that I was still alive.<br> While everyone was eating dinner,<br> I was alone 20 meters away from them.<br> I spend the night there,<br> That's when the set-up started.<br> In the morning,<br> she came to get me.<br> I'd grown up with that bridge<br> as my link to home.<br> But all I could think is,<br> If I could just get away for a moment,<br> Just get passed the police.<br> I might be safe.<br> And I was.<br> Until, you showed up.<br> You're safe now.<br> How did you got away?<br> Someone saved me too.<br> - How're you feeling?<br> - I'm fine.<br> Thank you, Anna.<br> I made you a promise.<br> Whether you found anything,<br> or not.<br> So, What do you have to tell me?<br> Hello, Henrik.<br> I dont even remember Wennerstrom<br> working here, much less<br> - being fired.<br> - How could you?<br> It was a long time ago.<br> Which is kind of more to the point than<br> the money he embezzled to start...<br> If you're referring to<br> the statued of limitation...<br> I had no idea, this was what<br> Henrik was holding out. If I had,<br> I never would have let him bring you up here.<br> He wasnt trying to deceive you.<br> Oh, Come on, he knows you cant try<br> somebody after 35 years after the event.<br> I like Henrik,<br> but he knows that.<br> A mans reputation used to mean<br> something -<br> he still believes that.<br> Im sure he thought you could destroy<br> Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion.<br> The court of public opinion,<br> now celebrates people's bad behaviour.<br> He promised me<br> Wennerstroms carcass on a plate.<br> This isnt even the plate.<br> I cant do anything with this.<br> Of course...<br> What happened with Wennerstrm?<br> How did he get you?<br> I was stupid.<br> I got something, I got it from<br> an anonymous source..<br> Who I'm sure, was one of<br> Wennerstrm's lakies<br> Which<br> he easily proved in court.<br> You were emphatic that the way I<br> looked into your life was illegal<br> and immoral.<br> Would you feel the same<br> about Wennerstrm?<br> Go on.<br> I did some work on my own on him,<br> before you hired me.<br> I havent had a chance to look at it all -<br> B'cos you and Harriet-fucking-Vanger<br> have kept me busy ...<br> - but I may have something.<br> - You may have something?<br> Maybe.<br> They launder money from arms and drug<br> sales, and<br> crime syndicates in Russia.<br> And that money - accounts for all<br> but 5-percent of his holdings -<br> the rest ends up in accounts in the<br> Cayman Islands.<br> How do you know this?<br> This time you dont want to know.<br> This time I do want to know.<br> I have access to his computer,<br> and<br> his accountants and lawyers.<br> And how do you have that?<br> I could have gotten it from a source<br> inside the company.<br> - But you didnt.<br> - But thats what youll say.<br> But what will you say to me?<br> That depends on<br> if you really want to know.<br> I do. Mikael,<br> Who gave you access?<br> Financial Journalist Mikael Blomkvist -<br> who this time<br> last year was convicted of libel<br> in a Stockholm courtroom -<br> doesnt seem to have learned<br> from his mistakes.<br> Or maybe he has -<br> In the current issue of Millennium<br> magazine,<br> he now charges the same<br> company that successfully sued him -<br> Before the shit hits the fan.<br> What happens now?<br> Hell say i'st a personal vendetta<br> but it wont work.<br> The police will investigate,<br> FI will investigate.<br> Maybe we'll go to court.<br> Maybe he'll go to prison.<br> Do you think?<br> Probably, not.<br> This guys never do.<br> - Whats wrong?<br> - Its embarrassing.<br> Tell me.<br> I need to borrow some money.<br> I have a chance to make an investment.<br> Its a smart, safe investment.<br> I really don't think I've got 50,000.<br> Yes, you do.<br> You have 65 thousand<br> in your two accounts.<br> Im sorry that I know that.<br> Youll get the money back.<br> I promise.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> You want a coffee?<br> These allegations - like the last<br> ones from this so-called journalist -<br> are as ridiculous as they are untrue -<br> Ill be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again.<br> Im looking forward to it.<br> What about his documentation?<br> Fabricated. All of it.<br> The Securities Fraud Office isnt<br> quite as certain as Mr. Wennerstrom of that.<br> If even a fraction of what Mr.<br> Blomkvist is alleging proves to be true,<br> not only will there be<br> a securities investigation,<br> but an organized crime<br> inquiry as well.<br> Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.<br> And we cant force him to.<br> But we can look for them.<br> - Beginning where?<br> - Beginning with...<br> those closest to Mr. Wennerstrm,<br> Only someone in the inner circle of a<br> corporation like this could have access<br> to this kind of information.<br> Mr. Wennerstrm isnt available for<br> comment today,<br> but Id be happy to answer<br> your questions.<br> - Where is he??<br> - No, he's not.<br> Has he left the country?<br> I don't think so.<br> Thank you.<br> With his failure to appear before a<br> Security Exchange Commission panel,<br> a warrant has been issued for The<br> Wennerstrm Group CEO.<br> I can confirm that he left Sweden on<br> a private jet<br> that landed in Paris last week,<br> but whether hes still there,<br> we dont know.<br> He could be anywhere by now.<br> Thank you.<br> I have a number of accounts at Bank<br> of Kroenfeld, Cayman Islands.<br> I'd like to transfer those accounts<br> and convert them to bonds.<br> Naturally,<br> you have the clearingcodes.<br> Naturally.<br> How many accounts<br> will you be transferring?<br> Thirty.<br> This will take some time.<br> For which youll receive<br> a 4-percent commission.<br> - I will?<br> - Then it wont be a waste of it.<br> A Swedish tourist vacationing here in<br> Barbados says<br> he knows where fugitive financier<br> Hans-Erik Wennerstrm is:<br> Here in this Caribbean islands<br> capital, Bridgetown.<br> Police released this photograph, yesterday-<br> and say they believe is the disgraced billionaire.<br> How many of these would you like to<br> convert for deposit?<br> All fifty.<br> Into five accounts.<br> That looks correct.<br> The man who is now being called<br> "Swedens Charles Ponzi ",<br> may not have<br> a country to call home,<br> but does have<br> enough money to buy one.<br> According to the International<br> Banking Commission,<br> Wennerstrm, a week after the<br> Millennium article appeared on news stands,<br> began emptying accounts<br> at Bank of Kroenfeld in the Cayman Islands.<br> That money, approximately<br> two billionEuros,<br> was then spread over a number of<br> accounts with the help of<br> this confederate,<br> seen here in Zurich -<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> The money I borrowed.<br> Already?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> I quit.<br> Was it a good investment?<br> It was okay.<br> What are you doing later?<br> I'm seeing my daughter.<br> Okay.<br> You look nice.<br> It's Christmas again ...<br> I'll see you soon.<br> I miss our meetings.<br> Im sure you dont.<br> Why would you?<br> I was always such a headache for you.<br> Never showing up with good news.<br> Only problems.<br> I have some good news now.<br> Ive made a friend.<br> I mean one that youd<br> approve of.<br> Im happy.<br> - shot three times in the head at<br> close range<br> in what is being called a<br> classic gangland execution.<br> The investigation into Wennerstroms<br> ties to crime organizations worldwide will<br> now turn to speculation:<br> Which of them caught up with him before<br> Swedish authorities could?<br> Wennerstrm spent<br> the last days of..<br> Its perfect.<br> - Your father?<br> - A friend.<br> Must be a very good friend.<br>
