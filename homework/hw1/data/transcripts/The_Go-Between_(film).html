Making money.<br> MURMUR OF CONVERSATION<br> I don't want you boys to get too hot.<br> Perhaps you should go and get yourself<br> a jolly nice glass of lemonade.<br> Ah! Marian, my dear.<br> - Hugh will be here on Saturday.<br> - Hmm. That's nice.<br> Hugh coming?<br> He's staying till the end of<br> the month, perhaps longer.<br> Are you sure, Mama? You know<br> Trimingham never misses Goodwood.<br> Well, I think this year he means to.<br> So, Leo. Marcus tells<br> me you are a magician.<br> No, not really. Only at school.<br> He put a curse on Jenkins and Strode<br> and they fell off the house roof and<br> broke every bone in their bodies.<br> - MRS MAUDSLEY LAUGHS<br> - They were dreadful bullies.<br> He could have killed<br> them, if he'd wanted to.<br> In fact, it was jolly<br> decent of him not to.<br> How powerful you must be, Leo.<br> I hope you're not going to curse us here.<br> Oh, no. I wouldn't do that.<br> Can you put a spell on the weather, then?<br> It would be lovely to have a hot summer.<br> Well, I don't know...<br> I'm sure it's within your powers.<br> Couldn't you do it, just for me?<br> In the name of Virgo,<br> I command the weather to obey me.<br> Make it a hot summer, the hottest ever.<br> BIRDSONG, CRICKETS CHIRP<br> You can't catch me!<br> What are we going to do to<br> combat this frightful heat?<br> No, no, no -- walk,<br> don't run, Marcus dear.<br> Haven't you anything cooler to wear, Leo?<br> I may look hot, but I'm<br> quite cool underneath.<br> Did you leave your summer clothes at home?<br> I expect Mother forgot<br> to put them in my case.<br> Why don't you write and<br> ask her to send them?<br> Oh, that would take too long.<br> Let me take him to town<br> tomorrow, get him a new outfit.<br> You'd like that, wouldn't you, Leo?<br> But I haven't much money...<br> That doesn't matter. We've got some.<br> Don't forget, he has the<br> things at home, Marian.<br> We'll give them to him<br> as a birthday present.<br> Your mother wouldn't mind<br> that, would she, Leo?<br> When is your birthday, by the way?<br> The 27th.<br> Of this month? How splendid!<br> Now we can all give him something to wear.<br> Bags I the ties!<br> Why don't you wait till Monday,<br> when Hugh will be here?<br> Then you could make up a<br> party and go together.<br> It wouldn't be any treat to Hugh.<br> He wouldn't want to go trailing<br> around the shops with Leo and me.<br> Besides, by Monday, Leo<br> will have melted into butter,<br> and all he'll need will be a muslin bag.<br> Are you sure you wouldn't<br> rather wait till Monday?<br> Quite sure.<br> But of course, if anyone would<br> like to come with us...?<br> Then I suppose we can go, Mama?<br> Of course.<br> How beautifully these are mended!<br> I wish we had someone who<br> could mend clothes like this.<br> My mother does it herself.<br> Those clothes you have at home<br> don't really exist, do they?<br> They do, but they're rather old.<br> We can't afford new ones.<br> Well, it'll be our secret.<br> TRAIN ENGINE CHUGS<br> Can I get a cup of tea, please?<br> Yes, of course.<br> Thank you.<br> Anyone would think you'd<br> never been on a train before.<br> MARIAN GIGGLES<br> Leo, I have a few errands to run.<br> Can you manage on your own for an hour?<br> I'll see you back at the station.<br> All aboard!<br> TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS<br> 3.42, calling at Halesham,<br> Croxham, Brandham...<br> 'Let me look at you.'<br> Perfect.<br> MURMUR OF CONVERSATION<br> MARIAN CLEARS HER THROA - GENTLE LAUGHTER<br> - Oh, darling Leo, look at you.<br> What a cool customer he looks!<br> Just like a cucumber.<br> And the same shade of green.<br> It's Lincoln green. He<br> might be Robin Hood.<br> And there's his Maid Marian!<br> - Do you feel different?<br> - I feel quite another person.<br> Let me look at you, Leo.<br> I think it does very well.<br> Did you see anyone in town?<br> Not a cat.<br> We were hard at it the whole<br> time, weren't we, Leo?<br> Yes, we were.<br> Well, he'll be much cooler now, anyway.<br> What a cheek! He must<br> know he's trespassing.<br> - Goodness! I think he's naked.<br> - Well, you'd better not look.<br> Ah, it's Ted Burgess, the<br> tenant at Black Farm.<br> We don't know him socially, of course,<br> but he mustn't think us stuck-up.<br> Whoever he is, we're going to change.<br> It takes us a long time.<br> He doesn't swim badly, for a farmer.<br> I didn't know anyone<br> were going to be here.<br> I shan't be long.<br> Well, don't hurry on our<br> account. We'll, um...<br> We'll swim further up.<br> Oh, by the way,<br> Trimingham's coming tonight.<br> Er, he'll probably want to<br> come and check on the harvest.<br> I shouldn't be a bit surprised.<br> Well, I... I think I put him at his ease.<br> LADIES GIGGLE<br> Oh, oh, my hair!<br> My hair's come down, it's all wet!<br> I'll never get it dry! I'm coming out.<br> LADIES LAUGH<br> Is that man going?<br> Yes. It's quite safe now.<br> Oh.<br> Hello, Leo.<br> Do you know him, Marian?<br> I don't know, I might have<br> met him. I don't remember.<br> You're here, though.<br> That's the main thing.<br> Come on.<br> Welcome back, my Lord.<br> I trust you had a comfortable journey?<br> - Perfectly tolerable...<br> - That's Trimingham.<br> He was wounded by the Boers.<br> He was shot in the face.<br> It's never got right.<br> He owns this house. Father is<br> just renting it at the moment.<br> Mama wants Marian to marry him.<br> - Mrs Maudsley, you're looking as<br> radiant as ever. - How kind of you.<br> But why, if he's so ugly?<br> Because it's such a good match.<br> Marian?<br> Bring his Lordship's bags upstairs.<br> ORGAN PLAYS<br> ALL SING HYMN<br> HYMN ENDS<br> I don't think we've been introduced.<br> My name's Trimingham.<br> - How do you do, Mr Trimingham?<br> - Oh, just plain "Trimingham" will do.<br> Aren't all grown-up men called Mister?<br> Oh, well, doctors aren't, or professors.<br> That's a title they have.<br> Ah. Well, I suppose I have a title too.<br> It's Viscount Trimingham.<br> But "Trimingham" is quite<br> sufficient in ordinary conversation.<br> You can call me Hugh, if you<br> prefer. I don't charge extra.<br> TRIMINGHAM CHUCKLES<br> You haven't told me your name.<br> It's Colston.<br> Mr Colston? Or Viscount?<br> My Christian name is Leo.<br> Really, it's Lionel, but<br> everyone calls me Leo.<br> Does Marian call you that?<br> I noticed you were talking earlier.<br> Yes, she does.<br> Well, then so shall I.<br> Do you like her -- Marian?<br> Enough to do something for her?<br> Anything.<br> Well, then take her a message.<br> Say I've got her prayer book.<br> She left it behind on the pew.<br> Marian?<br> - Hugh asked me to tell you...<br> - WHO asked you to tell me?<br> Yes, Hugh asked me to tell you...<br> WHO asked you to tell me<br> what? I don't understand.<br> Marian. Don't tease the poor boy.<br> She knows exactly who you mean, Leo.<br> MARIAN GIGGLES<br> - Trimingham says he's got your prayer<br> book. - Oh! - You left it behind.<br> How careless of me. Please thank him.<br> Why don't you go back and get it?<br> I'll fetch it later.<br> CHURCH BELL RINGS<br> Marian said thank you.<br> - Is that all?<br> - Yes.<br> Is it the Black Death?<br> I have a headache and some spots.<br> Mama thinks it's the heat,<br> but the doctor's coming.<br> Bad luck.<br> Perhaps we shall all get it,<br> then we shan't be able<br> to have the cricket match.<br> Is there to be a cricket match?<br> We have it every year. It<br> helps keep the locals quiet.<br> We'll never be able to<br> lift our heads if we lose.<br> BIRDSONG<br> CRICKETS CHIRP<br> Ah, Leo.<br> Marcus will be in bed for a day or two.<br> The doctor doesn't think it's<br> measles, but better safe than sorry.<br> Can you amuse yourself,<br> somehow, without him?<br> Perhaps you'll spend<br> more time with Marian?<br> I might. If she wants.<br> I'm sure she does. She's very fond of you.<br> Soon you'll know all her<br> secrets, won't you, Leo?<br> I think it's a messy, dirty business,<br> and no-one can say otherwise.<br> But the thing is, once you're<br> in a war, you must win it.<br> You must use every<br> weapon you have. It's...<br> it's not about bravery, you see,<br> it's about being the last man standing.<br> INSECTS BUZZ<br> DOGS BARK<br> BIRDS COO<br> HE CHUCKLES<br> Ah!<br> HE CRIES OU LEO GROANS<br> LEO GRUNTS<br> What the hell do you think you're doing?<br> I've a good mind to<br> give you a thrashing...<br> LEO WHIMPERS<br> I saw you at the river, didn't I?<br> You're from the Hall.<br> We better do that up for you.<br> Come on.<br> Sit down here while I get<br> you something for that knee.<br> You're lucky you didn't<br> spoil that nice green suit.<br> Miss Marian gave it to me.<br> Miss Marian Maudsley.<br> I don't have much to do with the Hall.<br> LIQUID POURS<br> Now, this might sting a bit.<br> STIFLED CRY<br> Brave lad.<br> Some boys might have cried.<br> How old are you?<br> I shall be 13 on the 27th of this month.<br> I should have given you a bit less.<br> You're small for your age.<br> Good things come in small packages.<br> But won't you need that?<br> I've got plenty more. Do I<br> look as though I haven't?<br> You can throw it away when you're done.<br> Try walking.<br> Thank you, Mr Burgess.<br> Is there anything I can<br> do for you in return?<br> Perhaps there is.<br> Could you take a message for me?<br> Of course.<br> But can I trust you?<br> Can I really trust you<br> to keep your mouth shut?<br> Are you ever alone with Miss<br> Marian? Just the two of you?<br> Sometimes.<br> Near enough to give her a<br> letter without anyone seeing?<br> Easily near enough for that.<br> Wait here, then, while I write it.<br> Is it a secret?<br> It's more than that.<br> If anyone else gets hold of this...<br> it'll be a bad lookout for her,<br> perhaps for you, too.<br> I'll defend it with my life.<br> Is this Mr Burgess' handkerchief?<br> Yes. He said he didn't want it back.<br> You can throw it away.<br> Perhaps I'll wash it out.<br> It's quite a good one.<br> He asked me to give you this.<br> DOOR OPENS<br> SHE SIGHS<br> These dresses...!<br> SHE CHUCKLES<br> Aren't you going to read it?<br> Later, perhaps.<br> Now, where's that bandage...?<br> You've already put it on.<br> So I have.<br> Your stocking, then.<br> You mustn't tell anyone about this letter.<br> Not even Marcus.<br> Of course not.<br> I'll be terribly angry with you if you do.<br> Oh... I won't be.<br> You see, Leo, it would get us all<br> into the most frightful trouble.<br> I won't say a word.<br> Mercury!<br> Just the man I was looking for.<br> Why did you call me Mercury?<br> Oh, well, Mercury was the<br> messenger of the Gods.<br> Can you take a message to Marian?<br> Tell her we need her to<br> make up a four at croquet.<br> You might have to search a bit.<br> We seem to have lost her.<br> Bring her in dead or alive.<br> BIRDS FLY AWAY<br> What are you doing here?<br> Trimingham asked me to find you...<br> Why? What time is it?<br> Nearly seven o'clock.<br> Oh. We don't dine until 8:30.<br> He wants you to play croquet.<br> He said I was to bring<br> you in dead or alive.<br> Did he? Well, which am I?<br> THEY CHUCKLE<br> What will you do to<br> amuse yourself tomorrow?<br> Well, I might do several things.<br> I might go for a walk...<br> Where might you walk to?<br> I might slide down a<br> strawstack at Farmer Burgess's.<br> Oh, really?<br> Well, if you do go that way...<br> will you give him a letter?<br> I was hoping you'd say that!<br> Why? Because you like him?<br> Because I like you.<br> That is very nice of you to say.<br> Tell her it's all right.<br> Tell her it's on.<br> You too, Trimingham.<br> I'm not much of an adornment.<br> Oh, do hurry up, Denys.<br> SHUTTER CLICKS<br> (Leo.)<br> Leo is so devoted to you, Marian.<br> He's like your little lamb.<br> - Hm.<br> - He follows you everywhere.<br> A little adult company goes<br> a long way at that age.<br> I thought I might pop into the<br> village later to visit Nanny Robson.<br> You know how she likes to see me.<br> Never mind Nanny.<br> You ought to pay more<br> attention to Trimingham.<br> Why?<br> You know why.<br> He's quite put out.<br> Has he said something?<br> No, of course he hasn't. But<br> don't think he hasn't noticed.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> MOTHER SCOFFS<br> You're being deliberately obtuse.<br> MARIAN SIGHS<br> Oh, Mama...<br> Leo!<br> I need you for a moment.<br> Will you take this to Mr<br> Burgess in the morning?<br> I can't go. Marcus is better now.<br> But still, will you try?<br> DOOR OPENS<br> Ah... A love scene!<br> I heard Marian calling and<br> I hoped it might be for me.<br> Can I snatch her from you now?<br> I thought we might take a<br> little stroll on the terrace.<br> GEESE CRY<br> How's the postman?<br> I won't be able to bring<br> you any more letters.<br> Miss Marian counts on<br> getting those notes through.<br> She won't know what to<br> do. No more shall I.<br> You wouldn't want Miss Marian<br> to stop liking you, would you?<br> No...<br> What difference would it make to<br> you if she stopped liking you?<br> Where would you feel it?<br> Oh. So you do have a heart.<br> She counts on getting those<br> letters through, same as I do.<br> It's something we both look forward to.<br> They're not just ordinary letters.<br> I know.<br> She'll miss them.<br> She'd cry, perhaps.<br> Is that what you want?<br> You look hot.<br> You better come in.<br> 'I thought I'd find you<br> out in the fields.'<br> I came back here to look after Smiler.<br> Is she ill?<br> In a way. She's going to have a foal.<br> Why is she having one,<br> if it makes her ill?<br> It's nature.<br> Between you and me, she<br> did a bit of spooning.<br> But spooning's so silly!<br> Spooning isn't silly.<br> That's just something spiteful<br> people say when it's...<br> well, when it's something<br> they want to do themselves.<br> They're envious, you see.<br> If you spoon with someone, does<br> it mean you have to marry them?<br> Generally speaking.<br> Could you spoon with someone<br> without marrying them?<br> I suppose so.<br> Right, that's enough<br> questions for one day.<br> But you haven't answered them.<br> You've hardly told me anything.<br> I'll make you a bargain.<br> I'll tell you all about<br> spooning, on one condition.<br> You go on being our postman.<br> DOOR OPENS<br> Hello, Mercury.<br> Er, bad news, I'm afraid.<br> We couldn't get you in the<br> team... to play the village...<br> so you're going to be twelfth man.<br> Twelfth man! I never expected anything.<br> I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do<br> you feel like taking a message?<br> Ask Marian if she's going<br> to sing Home Sweet Home<br> at the concert after.<br> HE CHUCKLES<br> Tell him I'll sing it if he'll sing<br> She Wore A Wreath Of Yellow Roses.<br> But I don't sing.<br> Oh, it was only a joke.<br> Do you think so?<br> Just do your best, old boy.<br> No-one can do more than that.<br> - Ma'am. - Morning. - Morning.<br> Ladies.<br> Hall team. You ready, chaps? Shall we?<br> Time to meet the enemy.<br> ALL: Good luck.<br> - Yes, good luck.<br> - Good game.<br> Mr Burgess, this is Leo<br> Colston, our twelfth man.<br> Master Colston and I<br> already know each other.<br> He comes to slide down my strawstack.<br> Ah, yes, of course, he told us.<br> But you should make him<br> run errands for you.<br> He's a wizard at that.<br> I'm sure he's a very<br> useful young gentleman.<br> SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMEN Come on, lads, let's have 'em.<br> APPLAUSE<br> OK, gents.<br> HE GRUNTS<br> CHEERING<br> Come on, lads.<br> Yes. Well played.<br> Ah, splendid!<br> Come on.<br> Take a single.<br> Come on, lads, look lively.<br> CHEERING<br> Well done.<br> - Bad luck.<br> - Good luck.<br> Good shot, sir. Well played.<br> Come on!<br> Sorry. Lad's a bit wild.<br> Oh, don't worry in the<br> least. All's fair, and so on.<br> CHEERING<br> Well done.<br> Now, come on, chaps.<br> - Right, shall we?<br> - Yep.<br> Come on, Ted!<br> Show them what you're made of, Ted.<br> Come on, Ted.<br> Everything depends on getting<br> Ted Burgess before he's set.<br> Burgess is just a hitter.<br> CHEERING<br> That's it, Ted.<br> Show them how it's done.<br> Come on, chaps. That's it.<br> You're a good boy, Ted.<br> CHEERING<br> HE SIGHS<br> Isn't it exciting?<br> HE GRUNTS<br> CHEERING<br> You don't want them to win, do you?<br> Come on, Ted.<br> CHEERING<br> HE GROANS<br> If we don't get him out soon,<br> we'll lose. That is unthinkable.<br> Can you carry on, old man?<br> No.<br> - One more.<br> - Leo.<br> Good luck, Leo.<br> - APPLAUSE<br> - Good luck, Leo.<br> I'm going to put you at square leg.<br> Now, you won't have much to do,<br> but sometimes he hooks one.<br> Just there.<br> HE BREATHES HEAVILY<br> CHEERING<br> Well done.<br> - Well done, Leo.<br> - You got him.<br> Well done, old man.<br> We did it!<br> HE LAUGHS<br> Sorry, Ted.<br> It was a damn good catch.<br> Well done, Ted.<br> Thank you very much. You<br> played extraordinarily well.<br> Have you tried that ale?<br> CHATTER AND LAUGHTER<br> I'm sorry, madam, but the<br> accompanist is feeling a bit seedy.<br> There's no-one to play the piano.<br> Well, Marian can play it.<br> Marian! Marian, you'll<br> play the piano, won't you?<br> Now, who'll start us off?<br> Come on, Ted! Give us a song.<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> Go on, Ted! Get up there, Ted!<br> Don't disappoint us, Ted.<br> All right.<br> APPLAUSE AND ENCOURAGEMEN Go on, lad. You surprise us.<br> Er...<br> My Love Is Like A Red, Red Rose.<br> My love is like a red, red rose<br> That's newly sprung in June<br> My love is like a melody<br> That's sweetly played in tune<br> And fair art though My bonnie lass<br> So deep in love am I<br> And I will love you still My dear<br> Till the sea's gone dry.<br> APPLAUSE<br> CHEERING<br> - Good job, Ted.<br> - Not bad, boy.<br> Not bad.<br> Don't they make a lovely couple!<br> LAUGHTER<br> Done us proud, Ted. Well done.<br> Well, what about our twelfth<br> man? Can't he give us something?<br> - Come on, Leo.<br> - Well done, Leo.<br> Go on, then, Master Colston.<br> Well done, young man, up you go.<br> ENCOURAGEMEN Don't be nervous, Leo.<br> Well, what's it to be?<br> I only know Angels Ever Bright And Fair,<br> but it's a sacred song.<br> That doesn't matter. I know it.<br> WOMAN: Come on, then, Master Colston.<br> Sh, sh, sh.<br> Angels<br> Ever bright and fair<br> Angels<br> Ever bright and fair<br> Take, oh, take me<br> Take, oh, take me to your care<br> Take me<br> Take, oh, take me<br> Angels<br> Ever bright and fair<br> Take, oh, take me to your care<br> Take, oh, take me to your care.<br> MUSIC ENDS<br> APPLAUSE<br> HE WHISPERS<br> Golly, you did look pleased with yourself.<br> But at least you got rid<br> of that brute Burgess.<br> God, when I saw him at<br> the piano with Marian...<br> it made me go all goosy.<br> Can you keep a secret?<br> I heard Mama talking.<br> Marian is to be engaged to Trimingham.<br> It'll be announced next week.<br> Are you glad?<br> Yes. I am.<br> I'm sure I am.<br> SOBBING<br> Why is there no fifth Viscount?<br> He's not here.<br> Well, that's rather a sad story.<br> He was killed in a duel<br> and some people thought it<br> rather a disgrace to the family.<br> Was he killed avenging his honour?<br> In a way.<br> He thought his wife was too<br> friendly with another man.<br> So he challenged the fellow to a duel.<br> The man shot him.<br> It should have been the other way around.<br> Yes, he was unlucky. His wife's<br> friend was rather a good shot.<br> BALLS CLINK<br> I didn't know people<br> fought duels about ladies.<br> Well, they did then.<br> Would the Viscount have minded<br> so much about the wife's friend<br> if he hadn't have been<br> married... only engaged?<br> Quite as much...<br> .. I should think.<br> BALLS CLATTER<br> I think it would be better<br> for all concerned to bring<br> the announcement of the<br> engagement forward.<br> We agreed it would be<br> the end of the summer.<br> - No. The whole matter is settled.<br> - No-one asked for my opinion.<br> Trimingham has been the<br> soul of honour and patience!<br> You couldn't make a better match.<br> - You mean YOU couldn't!<br> - You're being childish!<br> Am I to be allowed no say in my own life?<br> What possible objection could you have?<br> Don't you dare turn your back on me!<br> SHE WHIMPERS<br> Leo, there you are, I was looking for you.<br> Will you do something for me?<br> Of course.<br> Will you take this?<br> Where to?<br> The farm, you silly.<br> Oh... I can't.<br> Why not?<br> Because of Hugh.<br> - He might not like it.<br> - What's Trimingham got to do with it?<br> This is a business matter<br> between Mr Burgess and I.<br> You come into our house and we<br> make a great fuss of you, and now<br> you have the infernal cheek to say<br> you won't do a simple job for me!<br> I'll never speak to you again.<br> I know.<br> You want paying, don't you?<br> Well, how much do you<br> want, you little Shylock?!<br> SHE PANTS<br> HE SOBS<br> GUNSHO Do you ever miss?<br> Well, I'm a pretty good<br> shot, though I say it myself.<br> You been crying?<br> Come on.<br> Have you got a letter for me?<br> Have you any message for her?<br> Yes.<br> But do you want to take it?<br> Not much.<br> But if I don't, she'll be angry.<br> So it was her that upset you, then?<br> What can I do to make<br> things right for you?<br> Well, last time I was here you<br> said you'd tell me about spooning.<br> So I did.<br> HE EXHALES<br> Well, it's a job for your dad, really.<br> He should be the one to tell you.<br> My father's dead -- and I'm<br> quite sure he never spooned!<br> It's putting your arm around<br> a girl and kissing her.<br> I know that. But it's something else, too.<br> It makes you feel something.<br> It makes you feel on top of the world.<br> There must be more to it.<br> What do you like doing best?<br> Something that happens in dreams.<br> Like flying, or floating... or waking up<br> and knowing that someone you<br> dreamed was dead is really alive.<br> Right, well, I've never had<br> that dream, but you get the idea.<br> Think of that, and add some more...<br> and that's what spooning's like.<br> But you still haven't really told me.<br> You heard.<br> It's what you like doing<br> best, and then some more.<br> What more? I won't take any<br> more messages unless you tell me!<br> Look, you'd better clear off<br> quick or you'll be sorry!<br> Master Colston! Leo!<br> Wait!<br> HE ROARS<br> It's deadly nightshade.<br> Belladonna. Every bit of it is poisonous.<br> Don't!<br> You'll die!<br> MAN LAUGHS<br> It must be a loony talking to himself.<br> WOMAN LAUGHS<br> BOTH LAUGH<br> They're spooning!<br> Let's go and see who<br> it is and rout them out.<br> No. Leave them alone.<br> What confounded cheek!<br> Why should they come here to do it?<br> I wonder what Mama would say.<br> No, please don't tell her,<br> Marcus. Promise you won't!<br> HE GROANS<br> Your shot, old man.<br> He's daydreaming.<br> You look tired, Leo. You should rest.<br> He was up all night thinking<br> about his catch, I expect.<br> But for him, Burgess<br> would have won the day.<br> So, I've been talking to Burgess<br> about joining up to fight the Boer.<br> He's a likely man -- single, no<br> ties. He would make a first-rate NCO.<br> He's a good shot, too, by all accounts.<br> Not that I'm any<br> advertisement for Army life.<br> Is Ted really going to join up?<br> Oh, we're on "Ted" terms now, are we?<br> Well, yeah, the first time I<br> asked him he didn't want to.<br> But yesterday, he seemed<br> to have changed his mind.<br> Thought he might like a crack at them.<br> So, you think he'll go?<br> I think he may.<br> He won't be altogether<br> a loss to the district.<br> I didn't think you'd come again.<br> Is it true you're going to the war?<br> Who told you that?<br> Lord Trimingham.<br> Did you know Marian and he were engaged?<br> Is that why you're going?<br> I don't know that I am going.<br> It's up to her, really.<br> Look here, you haven't told<br> anyone about this, have you?<br> No.<br> She said you wouldn't.<br> I wasn't so sure, but she<br> said we could trust you.<br> I'm sorry I shouted at you.<br> It's natural for a boy your age<br> to want to know those things.<br> I just didn't feel like it...<br> not after hearing you sing like that.<br> Don't trouble yourself. I know<br> other people who'll tell me.<br> TED CHUCKLES<br> Well, so long as they<br> don't tell you wrong.<br> Shall I take one more message for you?<br> Are you sure you want to?<br> Yes...<br> just this one last time.<br> Well, tell her tomorrow's<br> no good, I'm going to town.<br> But Friday at half past<br> six, same as usual.<br> Have you got that?<br> Friday at half past six, yeah.<br> Ted?<br> Go to war?<br> What do you mean?<br> Trimingham asked him to sign<br> up, and he said he might.<br> Do you mean that?<br> Hugh made Ted say he would enlist?<br> I don't think Hugh could MAKE him go...<br> Ted as strong as he is,<br> stronger, I should think...<br> That's where you're wrong.<br> Ted is weak, as weak as water!<br> Hugh is far stronger...<br> Oh, my God...<br> If Hugh dares, I'll make<br> him put a stop to it!<br> Blackmail is a game two can play.<br> I'll tell him I won't<br> marry him if Ted goes.<br> You mustn't! They might hurt each other...<br> They might.<br> I tell you, Ted is a dangerous<br> man when his blood is up.<br> Perhaps Ted wants to go.<br> Oh, but he couldn't.<br> He couldn't.<br> Marian...<br> .. why don't you marry Ted?<br> I can't.<br> I have to marry Hugh.<br> I've got to.<br> 'Well, tell her tomorrow's<br> no good, I'm going to town.<br> 'But Friday at half<br> past six, same as usual.<br> 'Have you got that?'<br> He said today is no good...<br> but Friday, six o'clock...<br> Are you sure he said six? Not half past?<br> Yes. Six o'clock. He was quite certain.<br> Bless you, Leo.<br> You're a friend in a thousand.<br> I don't want bad things to happen.<br> I don't want Ted and Trimingham to fight.<br> I want it all to end.<br> This is the only way.<br> I'm sorry, Marian.<br> I'm sorry, Ted.<br> Leo the all-powerful commands<br> that Marian and Ted will quarrel.<br> Marian will go to the outhouse<br> at six... and Ted won't be there.<br> They'll quarrel. And they'll<br> never see each other again.<br> And Trimingham won't be killed in a duel.<br> I command it to be so.<br> I command it.<br> THUNDER RUMBLES<br> - Here's tea.<br> - Could I have some more milk, please?<br> This toast is a little underdone.<br> Tea or coffee, sir?<br> At least our birthday boy<br> is dressed for the weather.<br> He won't have to change<br> like the rest of us.<br> WOMAN LAUGHS<br> What do you say to a picnic at<br> luncheon, Leo, if it's not raining?<br> I expect you'd like the morning<br> free to play with Marcus.<br> Yes, thank you, Mrs Maudsley.<br> It's Leo's birthday, Mama. He<br> should choose what he wants to do.<br> But he's chosen, hasn't he?<br> Well, no. You... You've chosen for him.<br> I think you'll find the<br> arrangements perfectly satisfactory.<br> And then at... six o'clock...<br> .. we can help Leo cut his cake.<br> MAN CHUCKLES<br> At six? Tonight?<br> Yes, of course tonight.<br> Can't it be...<br> Can't it be what?!<br> That will be very nice.<br> You must tell Ted I can't<br> be there at six o'clock.<br> Oh, no...<br> But I say yes...<br> I can't.<br> Marian!<br> Leo?<br> What were you fighting about?<br> I was just teaching the<br> little beast a lesson.<br> I wanted him to take a<br> note to Nanny Robson,<br> let her know I'll visit her<br> some time this afternoon.<br> Would you believe it, he refused!<br> I shouldn't let it worry you, Marian.<br> You say Nanny hardly remembers<br> whether you've been or not.<br> I thought Leo and I might<br> take a walk in the garden.<br> He hasn't seen it properly yet.<br> Come along, Leo.<br> Are you interested in flowers, Leo?<br> A little, but mainly poisonous ones.<br> Mm-hm. You won't find many of those here.<br> How sweet of you to take<br> Marian's note to Nanny Robson.<br> Does she often send you with messages?<br> Not often. Just once or twice.<br> It rather worries me that I<br> stopped you going just now.<br> Perhaps you should go. You<br> know the way, of course.<br> Not quite, but I can ask.<br> You don't know the way?<br> Even though you've been there before?<br> Stanton! We have a note for<br> Miss Robson, rather urgent.<br> Would you mind taking it?<br> I haven't got it! It must have fallen out.<br> Feel again.<br> Very well. Just tell Miss Robson<br> that Marian will visit her<br> some time this afternoon.<br> I could ask you to turn out your<br> pockets, but I won't do that.<br> I'll just ask one question.<br> You say you took messages<br> for Marian before.<br> If you don't take them to Nanny<br> Robson, to whom DO you take them?<br> I think you are rather tired, Leo.<br> Go to your room immediately,<br> and rest until your party.<br> We must look after you...<br> for your mother's sake.<br> INSECT BUZZES<br> THUNDER RUMBLES<br> Ahhh!<br> - Many happy returns.<br> - Many happy returns, Leo.<br> Very happy birthday to you, Leo.<br> The number 13 is unlucky, so...<br> so we've put 12 candles round<br> the big cake, and then, when they're<br> blown out, you can light this one.<br> - When will that be?<br> - When Marian comes.<br> She wants to be the first<br> person to give you a present.<br> Well, she's missed her<br> chance! Leo can have mine now.<br> I think it turned out rather well.<br> Come and sit here, dear, next to me.<br> DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER<br> Come on, Leo, show us what you can do!<br> LEO BLOWS<br> DENYS CHUCKLES<br> HUGH CHUCKLES<br> THEY LAUGH<br> APPLAUSE AND CONGRATULATIONS<br> Leave a piece for Marian.<br> Yes, er, she... she<br> ought to be here by now.<br> I sent the carriage for<br> her. It'll be back soon.<br> Why don't you p-pass the cake around, Leo?<br> Excuse me, madam.<br> Miss Marian wasn't at Miss Robson's...<br> .. and hasn't been all day.<br> Where CAN she be?<br> Well, all we can do is wait.<br> No, we won't wait!<br> I'm... I'm going to look for her.<br> Leo, you know where she<br> is. You know where she is.<br> - Mrs Maudsley...<br> - You can show me the way.<br> Mrs Maudsley, please, Madeleine...<br> Stay here!<br> THUNDER RUMBLES<br> I know you know where she is.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> You know where they are.<br> Come on!<br> THEY GROAN<br> SHE GRUNTS<br> THEY GROAN<br> No!!!!<br> Liar...<br> serpent...<br> deceiver...!<br> SHE WAILS<br> SHE WAILS<br> THUNDER RUMBLES<br> GUNSHO BIRDS CRY<br> HE SOBS<br> HE SOBS<br> 'But for that fateful summer of 1900...<br> '.. everything would be different.<br> 'My life would be different.<br> 'I should not be alone.<br> 'I've been a foreigner<br> in a world of emotion...<br> '.. ignorant of its language.<br> 'The truth is...<br> 'I've been too afraid... to live.'<br> I'll drop it round to Brandham later.<br> Very good, Steven.<br> ENGINE STARTS<br> Leo?<br> (Leo.)<br> I half expected you to look<br> as you were, a little boy.<br> I should know you anywhere, Marian.<br> Well, Marcus was killed...<br> .. in the first war...<br> Denys also.<br> And your mother?<br> Oh. Poor Mama.<br> Those nervous types...<br> Well, she couldn't stay<br> with us, she had to go away.<br> And, Leo... You were<br> ill, too, weren't you?<br> I lost my memory. Or<br> rather, I chose to lose it.<br> But I recovered, in my fashion!<br> And Hugh? What about him?<br> Oh, he married me.<br> He was as true as steel.<br> We raised a son.<br> I saw your grandson in the village.<br> Does he remind you of anyone?<br> His grandfather, Ted Burgess.<br> Does he know?<br> The village is a hive of gossip.<br> He hardly ever comes to see me.<br> He's got some kind of grudge against me...<br> His own grandmother!<br> He wants to marry a nice<br> girl but he can't ask her<br> because he feels weighed<br> down with all of this.<br> He feels ashamed, he feels<br> there's some kind of curse on him.<br> A curse?<br> Yes. But you could help, Leo.<br> Tell him.<br> You know all the facts,<br> you know what happened.<br> Ted and I... were lovers.<br> I'm not a child any more, Marian...<br> to be ordered about.<br> Please!<br> You owe it to us... to Ted and me.<br> Do you remember...<br> .. what that summer was like?<br> There hasn't been such a<br> beautiful summer since.<br> And what was the most<br> beautiful thing in it?<br> Our feelings for each other.<br> And it was beautiful love.<br> Wouldn't you feel proud to be<br> descended from such a union?<br> Yes. Yes, I would.<br> So tell him.<br> Tell him... everything.<br> Make my grandson give up this<br> ridiculous notion that he<br> can't marry.<br> Every man should get married.<br> You too, Leo.<br> You're all dried up.<br> I can see that.<br> It's not too late.<br> Don't YOU feel the need for love?<br> Tell my grandson there's<br> no spell or curse,<br> except an unloving heart.<br> BIRDSONG<br>
