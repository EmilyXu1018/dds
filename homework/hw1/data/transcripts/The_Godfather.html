                        I believe in America.<br> America has made my fortune.<br> And I raised my daughter<br> in the American fashion.<br> I gave her freedom, but I taught her<br> never to dishonour her family.<br> She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.<br> She went to the movies with him.<br> She stayed out late.<br> I didn't protest.<br> Two months ago he took her for a drive<br> with another boyfriend.<br> They made her drink whiskey...<br> ...and then they tried to<br> take advantage of her.<br> She resisted, she kept her honour.<br> So they beat her like an animal.<br> When I went to the hospital,<br> her nose was broken...<br> ...her jaw was shattered,<br> held together by wire.<br> She couldn't even weep<br> because of the pain.<br> But I wept. Why did I weep?<br> She was the light of my life.<br> Beautiful girl.<br> Now she will never be beautiful again.<br> Sorry.<br> I went to the police,<br> like a good American.<br> These two boys were brought to trial.<br> The judge sentenced them to three years<br> in prison, but suspended the sentence.<br> Suspended the sentence!<br> They went free that very day!<br> I stood in the courtroom like a fool.<br> Those two bastards, they smiled at me.<br> Then I said to my wife, "For justice,<br> we must go to Don Corleone. "<br> Why did you go to the police?<br> Why didn't you come to me first?<br> What do you want of me? Tell me<br> anything, but do what I beg you to do.<br> What is that?<br> I want them dead.<br> That I cannot do.<br> I'll give you anything you ask.<br> I've known you many years, but this<br> is the first time you've asked for help.<br> I can't remember the last time<br> you invited me for a cup of coffee.<br> Even though my wife is godmother<br> to your only child.<br> But let's be frank here.<br> You never wanted my friendship.<br> And you were afraid to be in my debt.<br> I didn't want to get into trouble.<br> I understand.<br> You found Paradise in America.<br> You made a good living, had police<br> protection and there were courts of law.<br> You didn't need a friend like me.<br> But now you come to me and say...<br> "Don Corleone, give me justice. "<br> But you don't ask with respect.<br> You don't offer friendship. You don't<br> even think to call me Godfather.<br> You come on my daughter's wedding<br> day and ask me to murder for money.<br> I ask you for justice.<br> That is not justice.<br> Your daughter is alive.<br> Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.<br> How much shall I pay you?<br> Bonasera, Bonasera.<br> What have I ever done to make you<br> treat me so disrespectfully?<br> If you'd come in friendship...<br> ...the scum that ruined your daughter<br> would be suffering this very day.<br> And if an honest man like you should<br> make enemies, they'd be my enemies.<br> And then they would fear you.<br> Be my friend?<br> Godfather?<br> Good.<br> Some day, and that day may never<br> come, I'll ask a service of you.<br> But until that day...<br> ...accept this justice as a gift<br> on my daughter's wedding day.<br> - Grazie, Godfather.<br> - Prego.<br> Give this to Clemenza.<br> I want people that aren't going to<br> get carried away.<br> We're not murderers,<br> in spite of what this undertaker says.<br> - Where's Michael?<br> - Don't worry, he'll be here.<br> We're not taking the picture<br> without Michael.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - It's Michael.<br> Don Barzini.<br> Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.<br> Paulie! More wine.<br> - You look terrific on the floor.<br> - Are you a dance judge or something?<br> Take a walk and do your job.<br> Sandra, watch the kids.<br> Don't let them run wild.<br> You watch yourself, all right?<br> In that little silk purse.<br> If this were somebody else's wedding...<br> Sfortunato!<br> Hey, Paulie!<br> Stupid jerk!<br> What's the matter?<br> - Have to go back to work.<br> - Tom.<br> No Sicilian can refuse any request<br> on his daughter's wedding day.<br> Don Corleone, I'm honoured and<br> grateful that you have invited me.<br> Get out of here!<br> It's a private party. Go on!<br> What is it? It's my sister's wedding.<br> Goddamn FBl don't respect nothing!<br> Come here, come here, come here!<br> ...but towards the end, he was paroled<br> to help with the American war effort...<br> ...so for six months he's worked<br> in my pastry shop.<br> Nazorine, what can I do for you?<br> Now that the war is over...<br> ...this boy, Enzo, they want to<br> repatriate him back to Italy.<br> Godfather, I have a daughter.<br> You see, she and Enzo...<br> You want Enzo to stay in this country,<br> and your daughter to be married.<br> You understand everything.<br> Mr Hagen. Thank you.<br> Wait till you see the wedding cake<br> I made for your daughter!<br> The bride, the groom and the angel...<br> - Who should I give this job to?<br> - Not to our pais.<br> Give it to a Jew Congressman in<br> another district. Who else is on the list?<br> Hey, Michael!<br> He's not on the list,<br> but Luca Brasi wants to see you.<br> Is this necessary?<br> He didn't expect to be invited to the<br> wedding, so he wanted to thank you.<br> Don Corleone, I'm honoured and<br> grateful that you have invited me...<br> ...on the wedding day of your daughter.<br> May their first child be a masculine child.<br> Michael...<br> That man over there<br> is talking to himself.<br> See that scary guy over there?<br> - He's a very scary guy.<br> - What's his name?<br> His name is Luca Brasi.<br> He helps my father out sometimes.<br> Michael, he's coming over here!<br> You look terrific!<br> My brother Tom Hagen,<br> Miss Kay Adams.<br> Your father's been asking for you.<br> - Very nice to meet you.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> Why does your brother<br> have a different name?<br> My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen<br> in the street.<br> He had no home,<br> so my father took him in.<br> He's been with us ever since.<br> He's a good lawyer.<br> Not a Sicilian. I think he's<br> going to be consigliere.<br> - What's that?<br> - That's a...<br> ...like a counsellor, an advisor.<br> Very important for the family.<br> You like your lasagne?<br> Don Corleone.<br> I'm honoured and grateful...<br> ...that you have invited me<br> to your daughter's wedding.<br> On the day of your daughter's wedding.<br> And I hope that their first child<br> will be a masculine child.<br> I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.<br> - For your daughter's bridal purse.<br> - Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.<br> Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you<br> now, because I know you're busy.<br> Thank you.<br> Signora Corleone!<br> No!<br> Senator Cauley apologised for not<br> coming, but said you'd understand.<br> Also some of the judges.<br> They've all sent gifts.<br> What is that outside?<br> Johnny! Johnny!<br> I love you!<br> He came all the way from California.<br> I told you he'd come!<br> - He's probably in trouble again.<br> - He's a good godson.<br> Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!<br> You never said you knew<br> Johnny Fontane!<br> - Sure. You want to meet him?<br> - Great! Sure.<br> - My father helped him with his career.<br> - He did?<br> How?<br> - Let's listen to this song.<br> - Michael...<br> Please, Michael. Tell me.<br> When Johnny was starting out, he was<br> signed to a personal service contract...<br> ...with a big bandleader.<br> And as his career got better and better,<br> he wanted to get out of it.<br> Johnny is my father's godson.<br> My father went to see this bandleader.<br> He offered him 10,000 dollars<br> to let Johnny go...<br> ...but the bandleader said no.<br> So the next day my father went to see<br> him, but this time with Luca Brasi.<br> Within an hour...<br> ...he signed a release<br> for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.<br> - How did he do that?<br> - Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.<br> - What was that?<br> - Luca Brasi held a gun to his head...<br> ...and father said that either his brains or<br> his signature would be on the contract.<br> That's a true story.<br> That's my family, Kay. It's not me.<br> Beautiful!<br> I'll take care of it.<br> Tom...<br> I want you to find Santino.<br> Tell him to come to the office.<br> How are you, Fredo?<br> My brother Fredo,<br> this is Kay Adams.<br> - Hi.<br> - How are you doing?<br> - This is my brother Mike.<br> - Are you having a good time?<br> Yeah. This is your friend?<br> I don't know what to do.<br> My voice is weak. It's weak.<br> Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,<br> it puts me right back on top again.<br> But this... Man won't give it to me,<br> the head of the studio.<br> - What's his name?<br> - Woltz.<br> He won't give it to me,<br> and he says there's no chance.<br> Sonny?<br> Sonny?<br> Sonny?<br> - Sonny, are you in there?<br> - What?<br> The old man wants you.<br> One minute.<br> A month ago he bought the movie rights<br> to this book, a best-seller.<br> The main character<br> is a guy just like me.<br> I wouldn't even have to act.<br> Godfather, I don't know what to do.<br> You can act like a man!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Is this how you turned out a Hollywood<br> finocchio, that cries like a woman?<br> "What can I do? What can I do?"<br> What is that nonsense?<br> Ridiculous.<br> - You spend time with your family?<br> - Sure I do.<br> Good.<br> Because a man who doesn't spend time<br> with his family can never be a real man.<br> You look terrible. I want you to eat.<br> Rest, and in a month this Hollywood<br> big shot will give you what you want.<br> It's too late, they start shooting<br> in a week.<br> I'm going to make him an offer<br> he can't refuse.<br> Just go outside and enjoy yourself,<br> and forget about all this nonsense.<br> - I want you to leave it all to me.<br> - All right.<br> - What time does my daughter leave?<br> - Soon, after they cut the cake.<br> Do we give your son-in-law<br> something important?<br> Never. Give him a living, but never<br> discuss the family business with him.<br> - What else?<br> - Virgil Sollozzo called.<br> - We'll have to see him next week.<br> - When you come back from California.<br> - When am I going to California?<br> - Tonight.<br> I want you to talk to this movie big shot<br> and settle this business for Johnny.<br> If there's nothing else, I'd like to go<br> to my daughter's wedding.<br> Carlo, we're going to take the picture.<br> Wait a minute.<br> No, Michael. Not me.<br> Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!<br> - You need a little more heat on that arc.<br> - Start talking.<br> I was sent by a friend<br> of Johnny Fontane.<br> This friend would give<br> his friendship to Mr Woltz...<br> ...if Mr Woltz would grant us a favour.<br> Woltz is listening.<br> Give Johnny the part in that war film<br> you're starting next week.<br> And what favour would your friend<br> grant Mr Woltz?<br> He could make your future union<br> problems disappear.<br> And one of your stars has just moved<br> from marijuana to heroin.<br> Are you trying to muscle me?<br> Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!<br> Let me lay it on the line. Johnny<br> Fontane will never get that movie!<br> No matter how many Dago Guinea<br> greaseballs come out of the woodwork!<br> - I'm German-Irish.<br> - Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.<br> - I'm going to make trouble for you!<br> - I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...<br> I know New York's big lawyers.<br> Who are you?<br> I have a special practice. I handle<br> one client. I'll wait for your call.<br> By the way, I admire your pictures<br> very much.<br> Check him out.<br> - It's really beautiful.<br> - Look at this.<br> - It used to decorate a king's palace.<br> - Very nice.<br> Why didn't you say<br> you work for Corleone?<br> I thought you were some cheap hustler<br> Johnny was running in.<br> - I only use his name when necessary.<br> - How's your drink?<br> - Fine.<br> - Now I'll show you something beautiful.<br> You do appreciate beauty, don't you?<br> There you are.<br> I bet Russian czars never paid<br> that for a single horse.<br> Khartoum.<br> Khartoum.<br> I'm not going to race him, though.<br> I'm going to put him out to stud.<br> Thanks, Tony.<br> Let's get something to eat.<br> Corleone is Johnny's godfather.<br> To the Italian people that's<br> a very sacred, close relationship.<br> I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything<br> else. This favour I can't give him.<br> He never asks a second favour<br> when he's been refused the first.<br> You don't understand. Johnny Fontane<br> never gets that movie.<br> That part is perfect for him.<br> It'll make him a big star.<br> I'm going to run him out of the business,<br> and let me tell you why.<br> Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz<br> International's most valuable protgs.<br> We trained her for five years.<br> Singing, acting, dancing lessons.<br> I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars<br> on her, to make her a big star.<br> Let me be even more frank.<br> To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted<br> man. That it's not all dollars and cents.<br> She was beautiful.<br> She was young and innocent!<br> She's the greatest piece of ass I've had<br> and I've had them all over the world.<br> Then Johnny Fontane comes along with<br> his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.<br> And she runs off.<br> She threw it all away<br> just to make me look ridiculous!<br> And a man in my position can't afford<br> to be made to look ridiculous!<br> You get the hell out of here!<br> If that goombah tries any rough stuff,<br> tell him I'm no bandleader.<br> Yeah, I heard that story.<br> Thank you for dinner<br> and a very pleasant evening.<br> Maybe your car can take me<br> to the airport.<br> Mr Corleone insists on hearing<br> bad news immediately.<br> - You're not too tired, are you, Tom?<br> - No, I slept on the plane.<br> I have the Sollozzo notes here.<br> Now...<br> Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's<br> supposed to be very good with a knife...<br> ...but only in matters of business<br> with reasonable complaint.<br> His business is narcotics.<br> He has fields in Turkey,<br> where they grow poppy.<br> In Sicily he has plants to process them<br> into heroin.<br> He needs cash, he needs protection<br> from the police.<br> He'll give a piece of the action.<br> I don't know how much.<br> The Tattaglia family is behind him here.<br> They have to be in it for something.<br> - What about his prison record?<br> - One term in Italy, one here.<br> He's known as a top narcotics man.<br> - Santino, what do you think?<br> - A lot of money in that white powder.<br> Tom?<br> Yes. There's more money in narcotics<br> than anything else.<br> If we don't get into it, somebody else<br> will, maybe the five families.<br> With that money they can buy<br> more police and political power.<br> Then they come after us.<br> Now we have unions and gambling, and<br> that's great, but narcotics is the future.<br> If we don't get a piece of that action,<br> we risk everything in ten years' time.<br> So? What's your answer<br> going to be, Pop?<br> Don Corleone.<br> I need a man who has powerful friends.<br> I need a million dollars in cash.<br> I need those politicians that you carry<br> in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.<br> - What is the interest for my family?<br> - 30 per cent.<br> In the first year your end should be<br> three, four million dollars.<br> And then it would go up.<br> And what is the interest<br> for the Tattaglia family?<br> My compliments.<br> I'll take care of them, out of my share.<br> So I receive 30 per cent for finance...<br> ...political influence and legal protection?<br> That's right.<br> Why do you come to me?<br> Why do I deserve this generosity?<br> If you consider a million dollars in cash<br> just finance...<br> ...ti saluto, Don Corleone.<br> I said that I would see you, because<br> I heard you were a serious man...<br> ...to be treated with respect.<br> But, I must say no to you.<br> And I'll give you my reason.<br> It's true, I have<br> a lot of friends in politics.<br> They wouldn't be friendly long if I was<br> involved in drugs instead of gambling...<br> ...which they regard as a harmless vice,<br> but drugs is a dirty business.<br> It doesn't make any difference to me<br> what a man does for a living.<br> But your business is...<br> a little dangerous.<br> If you're worried about security,<br> the Tattaglias will guarantee it.<br> - The Tattaglias would guarantee our...<br> - Wait a minute.<br> I have a sentimental weakness<br> for my children, and I spoil them.<br> They talk when they should listen.<br> But anyway...<br> Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to<br> congratulate you on your new business.<br> I know you'll do well, and good luck.<br> Especially since your interests<br> don't conflict with mine. Thank you.<br> Santino.<br> Come here.<br> What's the matter with you? Your brain<br> is going soft from playing with that girl.<br> Never tell anybody outside the family<br> what you're thinking again.<br> Go on.<br> Tom, what's this nonsense?<br> It's from Johnny.<br> He's starring in that new film.<br> - Take it away.<br> - Take it over there.<br> And...<br> ...tell Luca Brasi to come in.<br> I'm a little worried<br> about this Sollozzo fellow.<br> Find out what he's got<br> under his fingernails.<br> Go to the Tattaglias.<br> Make them think that you're not<br> too happy with our family...<br> ...and find out what you can.<br> I got something for your mother<br> and for Sonny...<br> ...and a tie for Freddy,<br> and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.<br> - What do you want for Christmas?<br> - Just you.<br> Andiamo, Fredo.<br> - Tell Paulie to get the car.<br> - Okay, Pop.<br> I'll have to get it myself.<br> Paulie called in sick this morning.<br> Paulie's a good kid.<br> I don't mind getting the car.<br> Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.<br> - Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.<br> - I know.<br> You know who I am?<br> I know you.<br> You have been talking to the<br> Tattaglia family... Right?<br> I think you and I can do business.<br> I need someone strong like you.<br> I heard you are not happy...<br> ...with the Corleone family.<br> Want to join me?<br> What's in it for me?<br> $50,000 to start with.<br> Not bad!<br> Agreed?<br> Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.<br> - Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.<br> - I haven't got time.<br> Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.<br> What are you worried about? If I wanted<br> to kill you, you'd be dead already.<br> Get in.<br> - Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.<br> - Okay, Pop.<br> Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.<br> Would you like me better<br> if I were a nun? Like in the story.<br> No.<br> - What if I were Ingrid Bergman?<br> - Now, that's a thought.<br> Michael.<br> No, I wouldn't like you better if you were<br> Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?<br> They don't say if he's dead or alive.<br> - Sonny, it's Michael.<br> - Where have you been?<br> - Is he all right?<br> - We don't know yet.<br> There are all kinds of stories.<br> He was hit bad, Mikey.<br> - Are you there?<br> - Yeah, I'm here.<br> - Where have you been? I was worried.<br> - Didn't Tom tell you I called?<br> No. Look, come home, kid.<br> You should be with Mama, you hear?<br> Oh, my God.<br> Sonny!<br> Stay back there.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Open up, it's Clemenza.<br> There's more news about your old man.<br> Word is out that he's already dead.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Take it easy!<br> - Where was Paulie?<br> - Sick. He's been sick all winter.<br> - How often?<br> - Only three, four times.<br> - Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.<br> - Pick him up now.<br> I don't care how sick he is. Bring him<br> to my father's house right now.<br> - You want anyone sent over here?<br> - No. Go ahead.<br> I'm going to have a couple of our people<br> come over to the house.<br> - Hello?<br> - Santino Corleone?<br> - Yeah.<br> - We have Tom Hagen.<br> In three hours he'll be released<br> with our proposition.<br> Listen to what he has to say<br> before you do anything.<br> What's done is done. Don't lose that<br> famous temper of yours, Sonny.<br> I'll wait.<br> Your boss is dead.<br> I know you're not in the muscle end<br> of the family, so don't be scared.<br> I want you to help the Corleones<br> and me.<br> We got him outside his office<br> about an hour after we picked you up.<br> Drink it.<br> It's up to you to make peace<br> between me and Sonny.<br> Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?<br> And you knew<br> it was the right thing to do.<br> - Sonny will come after you.<br> - That will be his first reaction, sure.<br> So you have to talk sense into him.<br> The Tattaglia family is behind me.<br> The other New York families will go<br> along with anything to prevent war.<br> Let's face it, with all due respect,<br> the Don - Rest in peace - was slipping.<br> Ten years ago,<br> could I have gotten to him?<br> Well, now he's dead, Tom,<br> and nothing can bring him back.<br> You've got to talk to Sonny, to the<br> Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.<br> It's good business, Tom.<br> I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able<br> to call off Luca Brasi.<br> Yeah, well...<br> Let me worry about Luca.<br> You just talk to Sonny.<br> And the other two kids.<br> - I'll do my best.<br> - Good.<br> Now you can go.<br> I don't like violence, Tom.<br> I'm a businessman.<br> Blood is a big expense.<br> He's still alive.<br> They hit him with five shots,<br> and he's still alive!<br> That's bad luck for me, and bad luck<br> for you if you don't make that deal.<br> Your mother is at the hospital with<br> your father. Looks like he'll pull through.<br> It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip<br> Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...<br> - You gonna kill all those guys?<br> - Stay out of it.<br> If you get rid of Sollozzo,<br> everything falls into line.<br> What about Luca?<br> Sollozzo thinks he can control him.<br> If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.<br> - Has anyone been in touch with Luca?<br> - We've been trying all night.<br> - Hey, do me a favour...<br> - Luca never sleeps over with a broad.<br> Well, Tom, you're consigliere.<br> What do we do if the old man dies?<br> If we lose the old man, we lose the<br> political contacts and half our strength.<br> The other New York families might<br> support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.<br> This is almost 1946.<br> Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.<br> If your father dies...<br> ...you make the deal.<br> - Easy to say. He's not your father.<br> - I'm as much a son as you or Mike.<br> What is it?<br> - Paulie, I told you to stay put.<br> - The guy at the gates has a package.<br> Tessio, go see what it is.<br> - Shall I stay?<br> - Yeah. Are you all right?<br> - I'm fine.<br> - There's food. Are you hungry?<br> - No.<br> - A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - That might be a good idea.<br> Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.<br> Paulie sold out the old man.<br> - Make that the first thing on your list.<br> - Understood.<br> Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys<br> and go to Luca's apartment.<br> Maybe we shouldn't get Mike<br> mixed up in this too directly.<br> Hanging around the house on<br> the phone would be a big help.<br> Try Luca again.<br> - What's this?<br> - A Sicilian message.<br> It means Luca Brasi<br> sleeps with the fishes.<br> - I'm going.<br> - When will you be home?<br> Probably late.<br> - Don't forget the cannoli!<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> Rocco, sit on the other side.<br> You block the rear-view mirror.<br> Sonny's running wild. He wants<br> to go to mattresses already.<br> We have to find a spot on the<br> West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.<br> - Know a good spot on the West Side?<br> - I'll think about it.<br> Think while you're driving.<br> I want to hit New York this month.<br> Watch the kids.<br> Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up<br> Yeah, all right.<br> Make sure they're clean, because<br> the guys will be there a long time.<br> - They're clean and exterminated.<br> - That's a bad word to use.<br> Exterminate! Watch out,<br> so we don't exterminate you!<br> Pull over. I've got to take a leak.<br> Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.<br> Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!<br> - Yeah.<br> - Phone call!<br> - Who is it?<br> - Some girl.<br> - Hello. Kay?<br> - How's your father?<br> He's going to make it.<br> I love you.<br> I love you!<br> - Michael?<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> - Tell me you love me.<br> - I can't talk.<br> Can't you say it?<br> I'll see you tonight.<br> Why don't you tell that nice girl<br> you love her?<br> I love you with all my heart. If I don't<br> see you again soon, I'm going to die!<br> Come and learn something. You might<br> have to cook for 20 guys some day.<br> You start with a little oil,<br> then fry some garlic.<br> Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,<br> fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.<br> You get it to a boil, you shove in<br> all your sausage and meatballs.<br> Add a little bit of wine.<br> And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.<br> Cut the crap. I have more important<br> things for you. How's Paulie?<br> You won't see him anymore.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To the city.<br> - Send bodyguards with him.<br> - I'm going to the hospital...<br> He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows<br> he's a civilian.<br> - Be careful.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Send somebody with him anyway.<br> - I have to go.<br> - Can I go with you?<br> No, Kay. There will be detectives there,<br> people from the press.<br> I'll wait in the cab.<br> I don't want you to get involved.<br> When will I see you again?<br> Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll<br> call you at your parents' house.<br> - When will I see you again, Michael?<br> - I don't know.<br> What are you doing here?<br> You're not supposed to be here.<br> I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.<br> What happened to the guards?<br> Your father had too many visitors.<br> They interfered with hospital service.<br> The police made them leave<br> about ten minutes ago.<br> Get me Long Beach 45620, please.<br> Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.<br> Sonny, I'm at the hospital.<br> I got here late, there's nobody here.<br> No Tessio's men, no detectives,<br> nobody. Papa's all alone.<br> - Don't panic.<br> - I won't panic.<br> I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.<br> We're going to move him to another<br> room. Can you disconnect the tubes?<br> - That's out of the question!<br> - Do you know my father?<br> Men are coming here to kill him.<br> Do you understand?<br> Help me, please.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I am Enzo, the baker.<br> - Remember me?<br> - Enzo.<br> You'd better go,<br> there's going to be trouble.<br> If there is trouble, I'll stay here to<br> help you. For your father.<br> Listen. Wait for me outside,<br> in front of the hospital, all right?<br> I'll be out in a minute.<br> Just lie here, Pop.<br> I'll take care of you now.<br> I'm with you now.<br> I'm with you.<br> Get rid of these. Come here.<br> Put your hand in your pocket, like you<br> have a gun. You'll be all right.<br> You did good.<br> I thought all you Guinea hoods<br> were locked up!<br> - Why isn't anyone guarding my father?<br> - You little punk!<br> Don't you tell me my business!<br> I pulled them off.<br> - Stay away from this hospital!<br> - Not until my father's room is guarded.<br> - Phil, take him in!<br> - The kid's clean, Captain.<br> - He's a war hero. He's never been...<br> - I said take him in!<br> - What's The Turk paying you?<br> - Take a hold of him. Stand him up.<br> Stand him up straight.<br> I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men<br> are hired to protect Vito Corleone.<br> They're licensed to carry firearms.<br> If you interfere, you'll have to appear<br> before the judge and show cause.<br> Let him go.<br> - What's with all the new faces?<br> - We'll need them now.<br> After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.<br> We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Looks like a fortress around here.<br> Tommasuccio! Hey... 100 buttonmen<br> on the street 24 hours a day.<br> That Turk shows one hair on his ass,<br> he's dead.<br> Mike, let me look at you.<br> You're beautiful, beautiful.<br> You're gorgeous.<br> The Turk wants to talk! Imagine<br> the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.<br> - He wants a meeting today.<br> - What did he say?<br> What did he say... He wants us to send<br> Michael to hear the proposition.<br> He promises that the deal<br> is too good to refuse.<br> - And Bruno Tattaglia?<br> - That's part of the deal.<br> - He cancels out what they did to Father.<br> - We should listen to them.<br> No more! Not this time, Consigliere.<br> No more meetings, discussions,<br> or Sollozzo tricks.<br> I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...<br> - The other families...<br> - They hand me Sollozzo!<br> This is business, not personal!<br> - They shot my father...<br> - Even that was business, not personal.<br> Then business will have to suffer.<br> Do me a favour.<br> No more advice on how to<br> patch things up. Just help me win.<br> I found out about Captain McCluskey,<br> who broke Mike's jaw.<br> He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,<br> and for big money.<br> McCluskey has agreed to be<br> The Turk's bodyguard.<br> So when Sollozzo is being guarded,<br> he's invulnerable.<br> Nobody has ever gunned down<br> a New York police captain.<br> All the families would come after you.<br> The Corleone family would be outcasts!<br> Even the old man's political protection<br> would run for cover.<br> Do me a favour.<br> Take this into consideration.<br> All right, we'll wait.<br> We can't wait. We can't wait.<br> No matter what Sollozzo says,<br> he's going to kill Pop.<br> That's the key for him.<br> We've got to get Sollozzo.<br> - Mike is right.<br> - Let me ask you something.<br> What about this McCluskey?<br> What do we do with this cop?<br> They want to have a meeting<br> with me, right?<br> It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.<br> Let's set the meeting.<br> Get our informers to find out<br> where it's going to be held.<br> We insist it's a public place.<br> A bar, a restaurant.<br> Some place where there are people,<br> so I feel safe.<br> They'll search me when I meet them,<br> right?<br> So I can't have a weapon on me.<br> But if Clemenza can figure out a way to<br> have a weapon planted there for me...<br> ...then I'll kill them both.<br> Nice college boy. Didn't want to<br> get mixed up in the family business.<br> Now you want to shoot a police captain<br> because he slapped you?<br> This isn't like the army! You have to get<br> close and get their brains on your suit.<br> You're taking this very personal.<br> Tom, this is business<br> and he's taking it personal.<br> - Where does it say you can't kill a cop?<br> - Mikey...<br> I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up<br> in drugs, a dishonest cop.<br> A cop who got mixed up in the rackets<br> and got what was coming.<br> That's a terrific story. We have<br> newspaper people on the payroll, right?<br> - They might like a story like that.<br> - They might.<br> It's not personal, Sonny.<br> It's strictly business.<br> It's as cold as they come. Impossible to<br> trace, so you don't worry about prints.<br> I put a special tape on the trigger<br> and the butt. Try it.<br> Is the trigger too tight?<br> My ears!<br> I left it noisy, so it scares away any<br> pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.<br> You've shot them both.<br> Now what do you do?<br> - Sit down, finish my dinner.<br> - Don't fool around.<br> Let your hand drop to your side<br> and let the gun slip out.<br> Everybody will still think you've got it.<br> They'll stare at your face...<br> ...so walk out fast, but don't run.<br> Don't look anybody in the eye,<br> but don't look away either.<br> They'll be scared stiff,<br> so don't worry about nothing.<br> You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,<br> nobody knows where...<br> ...and we'll catch the hell.<br> - How bad do you think it will be?<br> - Pretty goddamn bad.<br> All the other families will probably<br> line up against us.<br> These things have to happen every five,<br> ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.<br> Been ten years since the last one.<br> You have to stop them at the beginning.<br> Like they should have stopped Hitler in<br> Munich, not letting him get away with it.<br> You know, Mike, we were all proud<br> of you. Being a hero and all.<br> Your father too.<br> Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.<br> Even Sollozzo's people don't know<br> where the meeting will be held.<br> How much time do we have?<br> They're going to pick you up outside<br> Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.<br> - We could put a tail on them.<br> - Sollozzo would lose our ass.<br> - What about the negotiator?<br> - He's playing pinochle with my men.<br> - He's happy. They're letting him win.<br> - Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.<br> The negotiator plays cards<br> until Mike is back safe.<br> - He could blast whoever is in the car.<br> - They'll expect that.<br> Sollozzo might not even be<br> in the car, Sonny!<br> I'll get it.<br> Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.<br> - Is it reliable?<br> - My man in McCluskey's precinct.<br> A police captain is on call 24 hours<br> a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.<br> - Anybody know this joint?<br> - Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.<br> A small family place, good food.<br> Everyone minds his business. Perfect.<br> They've got an old-fashioned toilet.<br> You know, the box and the chain thing.<br> We might be able to tape the gun<br> behind it.<br> All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant...<br> ...you eat, talk for a while, you relax.<br> Make them relax.<br> Then you go to take a leak. No, better<br> still, you ask permission to go.<br> Then you come back blasting.<br> Two shots in the head apiece.<br> I want somebody very good<br> to plant that gun.<br> I don't want him coming out<br> with just his dick.<br> - The gun will be there.<br> - You drive him and pick him up.<br> Let's move.<br> Did he tell you to drop the gun<br> right away?<br> Yeah, a million times.<br> Don't forget. Two shots apiece in<br> the head as soon as you come out.<br> How long do you think it will be<br> before I can come back?<br> At least a year.<br> I'll square it with Mom, that you're not<br> seeing her before you leave and...<br> I'll get a message to that girlfriend<br> when the time is right.<br> Take care.<br> Take care, Mike.<br> I'm glad you came. I hope we can<br> straighten everything out.<br> It's not the way I wanted things to go.<br> It should never have happened.<br> I want to straighten everything out.<br> I don't want my father bothered again.<br> I swear on my children<br> that he won't be, Mike.<br> But you have to keep an open mind<br> when we talk.<br> I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.<br> You can't talk business with him.<br> He's a good kid.<br> I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.<br> I've got to frisk you, so turn around.<br> On your knees, facing me.<br> I guess I'm getting too old for my job.<br> Too grouchy.<br> Can't stand the aggravation.<br> You know how it is.<br> He's clean.<br> Going to Jersey?<br> Maybe.<br> Nice work, Lou.<br> - How's the food in this restaurant?<br> - Try the veal. It's the best in the city.<br> I'll have it.<br> - I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.<br> - Go ahead.<br> What I want...<br> What's most important to me...<br> ...is that I have a guarantee.<br> No more attempts on my father's life.<br> What guarantees can I give you?<br> I'm the hunted one!<br> I missed my chance.<br> You think too much of me, kid.<br> I'm not that clever.<br> All I want is a truce.<br> I have to go to the bathroom.<br> Is it all right?<br> When you got to go, you got to go.<br> He's clean.<br> Don't take too long.<br> I've frisked a thousand punks.<br> Okay, you take over.<br> I love you, Grandpa.<br> I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.<br> - Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.<br> - Okay.<br> "I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish<br> I see you soon. Your grandson Frank. "<br> Go with your mother.<br> Take them downstairs.<br> Go on, Carlo, you too.<br> Go on.<br> - What's the matter with you, Carlo?<br> - Shut up and set the table.<br> Since McCluskey's killing, the police<br> have cracked down on our operations.<br> And also the other families.<br> There's been a lot of bad blood.<br> They hit us, so we hit them back.<br> Through our newspaper contacts<br> we've been able to put out material...<br> ...about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo<br> in the drug rackets.<br> So things are loosening up.<br> And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under<br> the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.<br> - I want him to rest.<br> - I'm going to learn the casino business.<br> Where's Michael?<br> It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.<br> But he's safe. We're starting to work<br> to bring him back.<br> Did you find out where that old pimp<br> Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.<br> Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.<br> If you go after Tattaglia, all hell<br> will break loose. Pop can negotiate.<br> - He must get better first. I'll decide...<br> - War is costly. We can't do business.<br> - Neither can they. Don't worry about it!<br> - We can't afford a stalemate.<br> - No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!<br> - You're getting a great reputation!<br> Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime<br> consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!<br> Pop had Genco. Look what I got.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.<br> Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.<br> Niggers are having a good time<br> with our policy banks in Harlem.<br> Driving new Cadillacs,<br> paying 50 per cent on a bet.<br> That's because they've started<br> making big money.<br> Poppa never talked business<br> at the table.<br> - Shut up, Connie...<br> - Don't you ever tell her to shut up.<br> Don't interfere.<br> I'd like to talk to you after dinner.<br> I could do more for the family...<br> We don't discuss business at the table.<br> I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.<br> Why are you so far<br> from the house?<br> You know I'm responsible to your<br> father for your life.<br> The bodyguards are here.<br> It's still dangerous...<br> We've heard from Santino<br> in New York...<br> Your enemies know you're here.<br> Did Santino say when<br> I can go back?<br> Not yet.<br> It's out of the question.<br> Where are you going now?<br> Take my car.<br> I want to walk.<br> Be careful.<br> Where have all the men gone?<br> They're all dead from vendettas.<br> There are the names of the dead.<br> Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!<br> Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!<br> Clark Gable!<br> America! Take me to the America, G.I.!<br> Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!<br> Mamma mia what a beauty.<br> I think you got hit<br> by the thunderbolt.<br> In Sicily women are more<br> dangerous than shotguns.<br> Did you have a good hunt?<br> You know all the girls<br> around here?<br> We saw some real beauties.<br> One of them struck our friend<br> like a thunderbolt.<br> She would tempt the devil himself.<br> Really put together.<br> Such hair, such mouth!<br> The girls around here are<br> beautiful... But virtuous.<br> This one had a purple dress...<br> And a purple ribbon in her hair.<br> A type more Greek than Italian.<br> Do you know her?<br> There's no girl like that<br> in this town.<br> My God, I understand!<br> What's wrong?<br> Let's go.<br> It's his daughter.<br> Tell him to come here.<br> Call him.<br> Fabrizio, you translate.<br> I apologise if I offended you.<br> I'm a stranger in this country.<br> I meant no disrespect<br> to you or your daughter.<br> I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.<br> My name is Michael Corleone.<br> There are people who'd pay a lot<br> of money for that information.<br> But then your daughter<br> would lose a father...<br> ...instead of gaining a husband.<br> I want to meet your daughter.<br> With your permission, and under<br> the supervision of your family.<br> With all respect.<br> Come to my house Sunday morning.<br> My name is Vitelli.<br> What's her name?<br> I'll knock you dizzy.<br> Save it for the library.<br> We've got to pick up my sister.<br> What's the matter?<br> What's the matter?<br> - It was my fault!<br> - Where is he?<br> It was my fault. I hit him.<br> I started a fight with him.<br> I hit him, so he hit me...<br> I'm just going to get a doctor<br> to take a look at you.<br> Sonny, please don't do anything.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> What am I going to do?<br> Make that baby an orphan<br> before he's born?<br> You spic slobs still betting Yankees?<br> Tell them to stop taking in action.<br> We lost enough money last week.<br> Come here, come here!<br> If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.<br> Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.<br> You should call.<br> Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.<br> - I want to reach Michael.<br> - Nobody knows where he is.<br> All we know is that he's all right.<br> - What was that?<br> - An accident, but nobody was hurt.<br> Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.<br> Please?<br> If I accepted that, a court could prove<br> I have knowledge of his whereabouts.<br> He'll get in touch with you.<br> I let my cab go, so can I call<br> another one, please?<br> Come on. Sorry.<br> - Hello?<br> - Is Carlo there?<br> - Who is this?<br> - A friend of Carlo.<br> Tell him that I can't make it tonight<br> until later.<br> Bitch!<br> - Dinner's on the table.<br> - I'm not hungry.<br> - The food is getting cold.<br> - I'll eat out later.<br> You just told me to make you dinner!<br> She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.<br> That's it, break it all, you spoiled<br> Guinea brat. Break it all!<br> Why don't you bring your whore<br> home for dinner?<br> Maybe I will.<br> - Clean it up!<br> - Like hell I will!<br> You skinny, spoiled brat.<br> Clean it up! Clean it up!<br> Clean it up! I said, clean it up!<br> Clean it up!<br> Clean it up. Clean that up, you...<br> Clean it!<br> Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.<br> Be a murderer, like your father!<br> - All you Corleones are murderers!<br> - I hate you!<br> Come on, kill me!<br> Get out of here!<br> - I hate you!<br> - Now I'll kill you.<br> You Guinea brat. Get out of here!<br> Connie, what's the matter?<br> I can't hear you.<br> Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.<br> Santino, I can't understand.<br> I don't know.<br> Yeah, Connie.<br> You wait there.<br> No, you just wait there.<br> Son-of-a-bitch.<br> - Son-of-a-bitch!<br> - What's the matter?<br> Open the goddamn gate!<br> Get off your ass.<br> Sonny!<br> - Sonny.<br> - Get out of here!<br> Go after him, go on!<br> Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!<br> Give me a drop.<br> My wife is crying upstairs.<br> I hear cars coming to the house.<br> Consigliere of mine...<br> ...tell your Don what everyone<br> seems to know.<br> I didn't tell Mama anything.<br> I was about to come up and wake you<br> and tell you.<br> But you needed a drink first.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, now you've had your drink.<br> They shot Sonny on the causeway.<br> He's dead.<br> I want no inquiries made.<br> I want no acts of vengeance.<br> I want you to arrange a meeting...<br> ...with the heads of the five families.<br> This war stops now.<br> Call Bonasera.<br> I need him now.<br> This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for<br> Vito Corleone, at his request.<br> You owe your Don a service.<br> He has no doubt that you will repay it.<br> He will be at your funeral parlour<br> in one hour. Be there to greet him.<br> Well, my friend, are you ready<br> to do me this service?<br> Yes. What do you want me to do?<br> I want you to use all your powers<br> and all your skills.<br> I don't want his mother<br> to see him this way.<br> Look how they massacred my boy.<br> It's safer to teach you English!<br> I know English...<br> Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,<br> Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.<br> Greetings, Don Tommasino.<br> How are things in Palermo?<br> Michael is teaching me to<br> drive... watch, I'll show you.<br> How are things in Palermo?<br> Young people don't respect<br> anything any more...<br> ...times are changing for the worse.<br> This place has become<br> too dangerous for you.<br> I want you to move to a villa<br> near Siracusa... Right now.<br> What's wrong?<br> Bad news from America.<br> Your brother, Santino,<br> they killed him.<br> Let's go... You promised.<br> Get the car.<br> Are you driving yourself, Boss?<br> Is your wife coming with you?<br> No, take her to her father's house<br> until things are safe.<br> Okay, anything you say.<br> Calo, where is Apollonia?<br> She's going to surprise you.<br> She wants to drive.<br> She'll make a good American wife.<br> Wait, I'll get the baggage.<br> Fabrizio!<br> Where are you going?<br> Wait there! I'll drive to you.<br> No, Apollonia!<br> Don Barzini, I want to thank you<br> for helping me organise this meeting...<br> ...and the other heads of the five families<br> from New York and New Jersey.<br> Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx...<br> ...and from Brooklyn...<br> ...Philip Tattaglia.<br> And from Staten Island...<br> ...we have with us Victor Strachi.<br> And the other associates that came as<br> far as from California and Kansas City...<br> ...and all the other territories<br> of the country. Thank you.<br> How did things ever get so far?<br> I don't know.<br> It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.<br> Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.<br> We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees...<br> ...then I'm willing to let things go on<br> as before.<br> We're grateful to Don Corleone<br> for calling this meeting.<br> We all know him as a man of his word.<br> A modest man who listens to reason.<br> Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.<br> He had all the judges and politicians<br> in his pocket.<br> He refused to share them.<br> When did I ever refuse<br> an accommodation?<br> All of you know me.<br> When did I ever refuse,<br> except one time? And why?<br> Because I believe this drug business<br> will destroy us in the years to come.<br> It's not like gambling or liquor<br> or even women...<br> ...which is something that most people<br> want, but is forbidden by the Church.<br> Even the police that have helped us in<br> the past with gambling and other things...<br> ...are going to refuse to help us<br> when it comes to narcotics.<br> I believed that then...<br> and I believe that now.<br> Times have changed.<br> It's not like the old days,<br> when we could do anything we wanted.<br> A refusal is not the act of a friend.<br> If Don Corleone had all the judges and<br> politicians, then he must share them...<br> ...or let others use them. He must let us<br> draw the water from the well.<br> Certainly he can present a bill<br> for such services.<br> After all, we're not communists.<br> I also don't believe in drugs.<br> For years I paid my people extra, so<br> they wouldn't do that kind of business.<br> Somebody says to them<br> "I have powders. "<br> "If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,<br> we can make 50,000 distributing. "<br> They can't resist. I want to control it<br> as a business, keep it respectable.<br> I don't want it near schools,<br> I don't want it sold to children.<br> That's an infmia.<br> In my city we would keep the traffic<br> to the coloured.<br> They're animals,<br> so let them lose their souls.<br> I hoped that we could come here<br> and reason together.<br> And I'm willing to do whatever is<br> necessary to find a peaceful solution.<br> We are agreed. The traffic in drugs<br> will be permitted, but controlled.<br> Don Corleone will give us protection<br> in the east, and there will be peace.<br> I must have strict assurance<br> from Corleone.<br> As time goes by and his position<br> becomes stronger...<br> ...will he attempt any individual vendetta?<br> We are all reasonable men.<br> We don't have to give assurances.<br> You talk about vengeance.<br> Will vengeance bring your son<br> back to you?<br> Or my boy to me?<br> I forgo the vengeance of my son.<br> But I have selfish reasons.<br> My youngest son was forced<br> to leave this country...<br> ...because of this Sollozzo business.<br> And I have to make arrangements<br> to bring him back here safely.<br> Cleared of all these false charges.<br> But I'm a superstitious man.<br> If an unlucky accident should befall him,<br> if he should be shot by a police officer...<br> ...or if he should hang himself<br> in his jail cell...<br> ...or if he's struck<br> by a bolt of lightning...<br> ...then I'm going to blame<br> some of the people in this room.<br> And that I do not forgive.<br> But, that aside...<br> ...let me say that I swear...<br> ...on the souls of my grandchildren...<br> ...that I will not be the one to break<br> the peace we've made here today.<br> Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's<br> drug middlemen have clean records?<br> Mention it. Don't insist.<br> - Barzini will know without being told.<br> - You mean Tattaglia.<br> Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never<br> have outfought Santino.<br> But I didn't know until this day<br> that it was Barzini all along.<br> Come on, Nancy.<br> Keep together, everyone. Brian.<br> Okay, all right.<br> How long have you been back?<br> I've been back a year.<br> Longer than that, I think.<br> It's good to see you, Kay.<br> I'm working for my father now, Kay.<br> He's been sick. Very sick.<br> But you're not like him. You told me you<br> weren't going to become like your father.<br> My father is no different<br> than any other powerful man.<br> Any man who's responsible<br> for other people.<br> Like a senator or president.<br> - How naive you sound.<br> - Why?<br> They don't have men killed.<br> Who's being naive, Kay?<br> My father's way of doing things is over.<br> Even he knows that.<br> In five years the Corleone family<br> is going to be completely legitimate.<br> Trust me. That's all I can tell you<br> about my business. Kay...<br> Michael, why did you come here? Why?<br> What do you want with me after all<br> this time? I've been calling and writing.<br> I came because I need you.<br> I care for you.<br> - Please stop it, Michael.<br> - Because... I want you to marry me.<br> - It's too late.<br> - Please, Kay...<br> I'll do anything you ask to make up for<br> what's happened to us.<br> Because that's important, Kay.<br> Because what's important is that...<br> ...we have each other.<br> That we have a life together.<br> That we have children. Our children.<br> Kay, I need you.<br> And I love you.<br> Barzini's people chisel my territory<br> and we do nothing about it!<br> - Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!<br> - Be patient.<br> I'm not asking for help.<br> Just take off the handcuffs.<br> - Be patient.<br> - We must protect ourselves.<br> - Let me recruit some new men.<br> - No.<br> - Barzini would get an excuse to fight.<br> - Mike, you're wrong.<br> Don Corleone...<br> You once said that one day Tessio<br> and me could form our own family.<br> Till today I would never think of it.<br> I must ask your permission.<br> Michael is now head of the family.<br> If he gives his permission,<br> then you have my blessing.<br> After we make the move to Nevada...<br> ...you can leave the Corleone family<br> and go on your own.<br> - How long will that be?<br> - Six months.<br> Forgive me, but with you gone, me and<br> Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.<br> I hate that Barzini. In six months' time<br> there will be nothing left to build on.<br> - Do you have faith in my judgement?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do I have your loyalty?<br> - Always, Godfather.<br> Then be a friend to Michael.<br> Do as he says.<br> Things are negotiated that'll solve your<br> problems and answer your questions.<br> That's all I can tell you now.<br> Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.<br> When we make our move there,<br> you'll be my right-hand man.<br> Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.<br> He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.<br> That's no reflection on Tom,<br> just how I want it.<br> If I ever need help, who's a better<br> consigliere than my father? That's it.<br> - Thank you, Poppa.<br> - I'm happy for you, Carlo.<br> Mike... Why am I out?<br> You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.<br> Things may get rough with the move.<br> Tom.<br> I advised Michael. I never thought<br> you were a bad consigliere.<br> I thought Santino was a bad Don,<br> rest in peace.<br> Michael has all my confidence,<br> just as you do.<br> But there are reasons why you must<br> have no part in what is going to happen.<br> - Maybe I could help.<br> - You're out, Tom.<br> I can't get over the way your face looks.<br> So good!<br> This doctor did some job. Did Kay<br> talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!<br> Leave them out here.<br> He's tired and wants to clean up.<br> Let me open the door, all right?<br> - Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!<br> - All for you, kid! It's all his idea.<br> - Your brother Freddy.<br> - Girls?<br> I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.<br> - Anything you want, kid, anything.<br> - Who are the girls?<br> - That's for you to find out.<br> - Get rid of them, Fredo.<br> - Hey, Mike...<br> - I'm here on business. Get rid of them.<br> I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.<br> Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.<br> Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.<br> Hey, come on! Scram!<br> Come on, honey. I don't know<br> what's the matter with him, Johnny.<br> Sorry.<br> I don't know. He's tired.<br> What happened to Moe Greene?<br> He had some business. He said to<br> give him a call when the party started.<br> Well, give him a call.<br> - Johnny, how are you?<br> - Nice to see you, Mike.<br> - We're proud of you.<br> - Thanks.<br> Sit down, I want to talk to you.<br> The Don is proud too.<br> Well, I owe it all to him.<br> He knows how grateful you are. That's<br> why he'd like to ask a favour of you.<br> Mike, what can I do?<br> We're thinking of giving up our interests<br> in the olive oil business and settle here.<br> Moe will sell us his share of the casino<br> and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!<br> Are you sure? Moe loves the business.<br> He never said nothing about selling.<br> I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.<br> See, Johnny...<br> We figure that entertainment<br> would draw gamblers to the casino.<br> We hope you'll sign a contract<br> to appear five times a year.<br> Perhaps convince some of your friends<br> in the movies to do the same.<br> We're counting on you.<br> Sure, Mike. I'll do anything<br> for my godfather.<br> Good.<br> Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.<br> Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.<br> - Good to see you.<br> - How are you, Moe?<br> Have everything? Specially prepared<br> food, the best dancers, and good credit.<br> Draw chips for everybody,<br> so they can play on the house.<br> Is my credit good enough<br> to buy you out?<br> Buy me out?<br> The casino, the hotel. The<br> Corleone family wants to buy you out.<br> The Corleone family wants to<br> buy me out? No, I buy you out.<br> Your casino loses money.<br> We can do better.<br> - You think I'm skimming off the top?<br> - You're unlucky.<br> You Guineas make me laugh.<br> I took Freddy in when you had a bad<br> time, and now you try to push me out!<br> You did that because we bankrolled<br> your casino...<br> ...and the Molinari family guaranteed<br> his safety. Let's talk business.<br> Yes. First of all, you're all done. You<br> don't have that kind of muscle anymore.<br> The Godfather is sick. You're getting<br> chased out of New York by the others.<br> Do you think you can come to my hotel<br> and take over?<br> I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal<br> with him and still keep my hotel!<br> Is that why you slapped my brother<br> around in public?<br> That was nothing, Mike.<br> Moe didn't mean nothing by that.<br> He flies off the handle sometimes,<br> but we're good friends.<br> I have a business to run.<br> I've got to kick asses sometimes.<br> We had an argument,<br> so I had to straighten him out.<br> You straightened my brother out?<br> He was banging cocktail waitresses!<br> Players couldn't get a drink.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> I leave for New York tomorrow.<br> Think about a price.<br> Son-of-a-bitch!<br> I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones<br> when you were out with cheerleaders.<br> Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.<br> Tom, you're the consigliere.<br> Talk to the Don...<br> Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and<br> Mike is in charge of the family business.<br> If you have anything to say,<br> say it to Michael.<br> Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and<br> talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!<br> Fredo...<br> You're my older brother, and I love you.<br> But don't ever take sides with anyone<br> against the family again.<br> I have to see my father and his people,<br> so have dinner without me.<br> This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to<br> the city, see a show and have dinner.<br> Your sister wants to ask you something.<br> - Let her ask.<br> - She's afraid to.<br> They want you to be godfather<br> to their boy.<br> - We'll see.<br> - Will you?<br> Let me think about it. Come on.<br> Barzini will move against you first.<br> He'll set up a meeting with someone<br> you absolutely trust.<br> Guaranteeing your safety.<br> And at that meeting<br> you'll be assassinated.<br> I like to drink wine more than I used to.<br> - Anyway, I'm drinking more.<br> - It's good for you, Pop.<br> I don't know.<br> Are you happy with your wife<br> and children?<br> - Very happy.<br> - That's good.<br> I hope you don't mind the way I keep<br> going over this Barzini business.<br> - No, not at all.<br> - It's an old habit.<br> I spend my life trying not to be careless.<br> Women and children can be careless,<br> but not men.<br> - How's your boy?<br> - He's good.<br> He looks more like you every day.<br> He's smarter than I am. He's three<br> and can read the funny papers.<br> Read the funny papers.<br> I want you to arrange for a telephone<br> man to check all in- And out-going calls.<br> - I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.<br> - That's right. I forgot.<br> What's the matter?<br> What's bothering you?<br> I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,<br> so I'll handle it.<br> I knew that Santino would have to<br> go through all this.<br> And Fredo...<br> Fredo was, well...<br> But I never wanted this for you.<br> I worked my whole life. I don't apologise<br> for taking care of my family.<br> And I refused to be a fool...<br> ...dancing on a string<br> held by all those big shots.<br> I don't apologise. That's my life,<br> but I thought that...<br> ...that when it was your time, you would<br> be the one to hold the strings.<br> Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.<br> Something.<br> Another pezzo da novanta.<br> Well...<br> Just wasn't enough time, Michael.<br> Wasn't enough time.<br> We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.<br> Now listen, whoever comes to you<br> with this Barzini meeting...<br> ...he's the traitor. Don't forget that.<br> Can I hold it, please?<br> - Can I water these?<br> - Yes, go ahead.<br> Over here, over here.<br> Be careful. You're spilling it.<br> Antony!<br> Come here, come here.<br> That's it. We'll put it right there.<br> I'll show you something. Come here.<br> Stand there.<br> Give me an orange!<br> That's a new trick.<br> You run in there. Run in there.<br> Where are you?<br> Mike, can I have a minute?<br> Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.<br> He says we can straighten out<br> any of our problems.<br> - You talked to him?<br> - Yeah.<br> I can arrange security. On my territory.<br> - All right?<br> - All right.<br> Do you know how they're going to<br> come at you?<br> They're arranging a meeting<br> in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.<br> Where I'll be safe.<br> I always thought it would be<br> Clemenza, not Tessio.<br> It's the smart move.<br> Tessio was always smarter.<br> But I'm going to wait.<br> After the baptism.<br> I've decided to be godfather<br> to Connie's baby.<br> And then I'll meet with Don Barzini...<br> ...and Tattaglia.<br> All the heads of the five families.<br> Michael, do you believe in God, the<br> Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?<br> I do.<br> Do you believe in Jesus Christ,<br> His only Son, our Lord?<br> I do.<br> Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,<br> the Holy Catholic Church?<br> I do.<br> Michael Francis Rizzi,<br> do you renounce Satan?<br> I do renounce him.<br> And all his works?<br> I do renounce them.<br> Oh, God!<br> - And all his pomps?<br> - I do renounce them.<br> Michael Rizzi, will you be baptised?<br> I will.<br> Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may<br> the Lord be with you. Amen.<br> Kay!<br> Kiss your godfather.<br> Can't go to Vegas. Something's come<br> up. Everybody has to leave without us.<br> - Mike, it's our first vacation!<br> - Connie, please.<br> Go back to the house, wait for my call.<br> It's important.<br> I'll only be a couple of days.<br> We're on our way to Brooklyn.<br> - I hope Mike can get us a good deal.<br> - I'm sure he will.<br> Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a<br> separate car, so you two go on ahead.<br> - That screws up my arrangements.<br> - That's what he said.<br> I can't go either, Sal.<br> Tell Mike it was only business.<br> I always liked him.<br> - He understands that.<br> - Excuse me, Sal.<br> Tom, can you get me off the hook?<br> - For old times' sake?<br> - Can't do it, Sally.<br> You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.<br> - Mike, you got it all wrong.<br> - You fingered Sonny for Barzini.<br> That little farce you played<br> with my sister.<br> - You think that could fool a Corleone?<br> - I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.<br> - Please, don't do this.<br> - Sit down.<br> Don't do this to me, please.<br> Barzini is dead.<br> So is Philip Tattaglia.<br> Moe Greene.<br> Strachi. Cuneo.<br> Today I settle all family business,<br> so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.<br> Admit what you did.<br> Get him a drink.<br> Come on.<br> Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think<br> I'd make my sister a widow?<br> I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.<br> Go ahead, drink, drink.<br> No, you're out of the family business.<br> That's your punishment.<br> You're finished.<br> I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.<br> Tom.<br> I want you to stay there. Understand?<br> Only don't tell me you're innocent.<br> Because it insults my intelligence.<br> Makes me very angry.<br> Who approached you?<br> Tattaglia or Barzini?<br> It was Barzini.<br> Good.<br> There's a car waiting outside<br> to take you to the airport.<br> I'll call your wife and tell her<br> what flight you're on.<br> - Mike...<br> - Get out of my sight.<br> Hello, Carlo.<br> - I'm trying to tell you...<br> - Mama, please!<br> Michael!<br> - What is it?<br> - Where is he?<br> Michael, you lousy bastard!<br> You killed my husband.<br> You waited until Papa died,<br> so nobody could stop you.<br> You blamed him for Sonny.<br> Everybody did.<br> But you never thought about me!<br> Now what are we going to do?<br> Connie.<br> Why do you think he kept Carlo at the<br> Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.<br> And you stood godfather to our baby.<br> You lousy cold-hearted bastard!<br> Want to know how many men he had<br> killed with Carlo? Read the papers!<br> That's your husband,<br> that's your husband!<br> No! No, no...<br> Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.<br> She's hysterical.<br> Hysterical.<br> Michael, is it true?<br> - Don't ask me about my business, Kay.<br> - Is it true?<br> Don't ask me about my business.<br> Enough!<br> All right.<br> This one time.<br> This one time I'll let you ask me<br> about my affairs.<br> Is it true?<br> Is it?<br> No.<br> I guess we both need a drink. Come on.<br> Don Corleone.<br>
