                        They've killed the boy!<br> They've killed young Paolo!<br> They've killed your son Paolo!<br> Murderers! Murderers!<br> My son...<br> All my respect, Don Ciccio.<br> You killed my husband because<br> he wouldn't give in to you.<br> And his oldest son Paolo...<br> ...because he swore revenge.<br> But Vito is only nine.<br> And dumb-witted.<br> He never speaks.<br> It's not his words I'm afraid of.<br> He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.<br> But when he grows, he'll grow strong.<br> Don't worry. This little boy<br> can't do a thing to you.<br> When he's a man, he'll<br> come for revenge.<br> I beg you, Don Ciccio,<br> spare my only son.<br> He's all I have left.<br> I swear to God he'll never do<br> you any harm. Spare him!<br> Move and I'll kill him!<br> Run, Vito!<br> Kill him!<br> Any family who hides the boy<br> Vito Andolini will regret it!<br> You understand?<br> Anybody who hides the boy<br> Vito Andolini is in for trouble!<br> Vito, we're praying for you!<br> If anyone is hiding the boy<br> Vito Andolini...<br> ...turn him over to us.<br> Don Ciccio will thank you for it!<br> lt'll be better for the boy,<br> and better for you!<br> Any family who hides the boy<br> Vito Andolini will regret it!<br> Nurse.<br> Money?<br> Interpreter!<br> Where are you from?<br> - What is your name?<br> - Maria.<br> What is your name?<br> Come on, son. What is your name?<br> Vito Andolini from Corleone.<br> Corleone. Vito Corleone.<br> Okay, over there.<br> Next.<br> Tell him he has smallpox.<br> Quarantine three months.<br> Vito Corleone!<br> Vito Corleone!<br> Here he is. This is him.<br> Did you bring the car keys?<br> Laurie! Laurie!<br> Mama!<br> Mama!<br> - Look who's here.<br> - Father Carmelo.<br> - This is Father Carmelo.<br> - I'm Merle Johnson.<br> Mama!<br> - Here I am.<br> - Constanzia, after one week?<br> I sent the car to the airport last week<br> to pick you up.<br> It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just<br> one week late. This is for my mama!<br> - What is this?<br> - You remember Merle?<br> Hello. How are you? Thank you.<br> Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him<br> and I can't wait on line.<br> You go see your children first.<br> Then you worry about waiting on line to<br> see your brother. Like everybody else.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> A most distinguished guest<br> would like to say a few words.<br> Please welcome Senator Pat Geary<br> of the State of Nevada.<br> And there is Mrs Geary.<br> Thank you very much.<br> This is a very, very happy day<br> for me and my wife Mrs Geary.<br> We see Nevada far too seldom.<br> But today we can join with old friends,<br> we can make new friends,<br> and we help celebrate<br> a young man's first Communion.<br> And also to thank that boy's family for<br> a magnificent contribution to the State.<br> I have here in my hand a cheque<br> made out to the university,<br> and it is a magnificent endowment<br> in the name of...<br> ...Anthony Vito Corleone.<br> The cheque is signed by<br> that young man's parents,<br> whom I think we should recognise.<br> Mike, Pat, Kay - stand up, please.<br> Let the folks see you!<br> Folks, I want you to join me<br> in giving a real Nevada thank you<br> to Mr and Mrs Michael Corleone!<br> We also have, as a special added<br> attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir,<br> who have chosen a certain special song<br> and a special arrangement<br> to honour their host,<br> Mr Michael Corleone.<br> Boys.<br> The plaque.<br> Okay, fellows, did you get that one?<br> Okay, that's good.<br> Now, Senator,<br> just you and Mrs Corleone.<br> My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.<br> He arranged everything<br> through your man Turnbull.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - Sit down.<br> I thought that you and I<br> would talk alone.<br> I trust these men with my life, Senator.<br> To ask them to leave would be an insult.<br> Well, it's perfectly all right with me,<br> but I am a blunt man and I intend<br> to speak very frankly to you.<br> Maybe more frankly than anyone in my<br> position has ever talked to you before.<br> The Corleone family<br> has done well in Nevada.<br> You own, or control,<br> two major hotels in Vegas,<br> and one in Reno.<br> The licences were grandfathered in,<br> so there was no problem<br> with the Gaming Commission.<br> Now my sources tell me<br> that you plan to make a move<br> against the Tropigala.<br> They tell me that, within a week,<br> you're going to move Klingman out.<br> Quite an expansion. However, it will<br> leave you with a little technical problem.<br> The licence will still be<br> in Klingman's name.<br> - Turnbull is a good man.<br> - Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.<br> I don't want to spend more time here<br> than I have to. You can have the licence.<br> The price is 250,000 dollars.<br> Plus five per cent of the gross monthly,<br> of all four hotels, Mr Corleone.<br> The price for the licence<br> is less than 20,000 dollars, right?<br> That's right.<br> - Why would I pay more than that?<br> - Because I intend to squeeze you.<br> I don't like your kind of people.<br> I don't like to see you come out<br> to this clean country in oily hair,<br> dressed up in those silk suits<br> and try to pass yourselves off<br> as decent Americans.<br> I'll do business with you, but the fact is<br> that I despise your masquerade,<br> the dishonest way you pose yourself<br> and your whole fucking family.<br> Senator...<br> ...we're both part of the same hypocrisy.<br> But never think it applies to my family.<br> All right, all right.<br> Some people have to play little games.<br> You play yours.<br> Let's say that you'll pay me<br> because it's in your interest.<br> I want your answer and the money<br> by noon tomorrow. One more thing.<br> Don't you contact me again, ever.<br> From now on you deal with Turnbull.<br> Open that door, son.<br> Senator, you can have my answer now<br> if you like.<br> My offer is this:<br> Nothing.<br> Not even the fee for the gaming licence,<br> which I would like you to put up.<br> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<br> Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.<br> - Honey, we have to go.<br> - Really? I'm sorry.<br> - It's been delightful.<br> - It was our pleasure.<br> It was wonderful talking to you.<br> Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,<br> you look great!<br> Frank Pentangeli! I thought you was<br> never coming out west, you big bum!<br> I've got to check on my boys.<br> - What's with the food here?<br> - What's the matter?<br> "A kid gives me a Ritz cracker<br> with chopped liver and says ""canaps""."<br> "I said, ""Can of peas, my ass. That's<br> a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"""<br> Bring out the peppers and sardines!<br> Seeing you reminds me of New York<br> in the old days!<br> You remember Willi Cicci, who was<br> with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?<br> We were all upset about that.<br> Heart attack, huh?<br> No, that was no heart attack.<br> That's what I'm here to see<br> your brother Mike about.<br> - But what's with him?<br> - What do you mean?<br> Do I have to get a letter of introduction<br> to get a sit-down?<br> - You can't get in to see Mike?<br> - He's got me waiting in a lobby!<br> - Johnny Ola.<br> - Al Neri.<br> - Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?<br> - I remember Tom from the old days.<br> Rocco...<br> - What's this?<br> - It's an orange from Miami.<br> Take care of Johnny's men. They look<br> like they might be hungry. Johnny?<br> Tom won't stay. He only handles<br> specific areas of the business.<br> Sure, Mike.<br> - What are you drinking, Johnny?<br> - Anisette.<br> - If you need anything, I'll be outside.<br> - Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.<br> - I just left Mr Roth in Miami.<br> - How is his health?<br> It's not good.<br> Can I do anything or send anything?<br> He appreciates your concern, Michael,<br> and your respect.<br> That casino...<br> Registered owners: Jacob Lawrence,<br> Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.<br> The real owners are the old Lakeville<br> Road group and our friend in Miami.<br> Klingman runs it and owns a piece of<br> it too, but I've been instructed to tell you<br> that if you move him out,<br> our friend in Miami will go along.<br> It's very kind of him.<br> Tell him it's greatly appreciated.<br> Hyman Roth always makes money<br> for his partners.<br> One by one, our old friends are gone.<br> Death - natural or not,<br> prison, deported...<br> Only Hyman Roth is left, because he<br> always made money for his partners.<br> I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional<br> musicians there isn't one Italian!<br> Let's have a tarantella!<br> You! Up, up, up!<br> Questa mano!<br> Questa mano!<br> What the hell have we here?<br> - I'll see my sister alone.<br> - It concerns me too. May I stay?<br> How are you, honey? You've met<br> Merle, he was with me in Vegas.<br> - I saw him with you.<br> - Could I have a drink?<br> Al, please get him a drink!<br> We're going to Europe. I'd like to book<br> passage on the Queen.<br> Why don't you go to a travel agent?<br> We're getting married first.<br> The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,<br> and you're getting married?<br> You see your children on weekends.<br> Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno<br> for a theft you don't even know about.<br> You fly around the world<br> with men who use you!<br> - You're not my father!<br> - So why come to me?<br> I need money.<br> Connie, Connie, Connie...<br> I want to be reasonable with you.<br> Why don't you stay with the family?<br> You can live on the estate<br> with your kids.<br> You won't be deprived of anything.<br> I don't know this Merle. I don't know<br> what he does or what he lives on.<br> Tell him marriage is out of the question<br> and you don't want to see him anymore.<br> He'll understand, believe me.<br> Connie.<br> If you don't listen to me,<br> and marry this man...<br> ...you'll disappoint me.<br> - Famiglia!<br> - Cent' anni!<br> "What's ""Chen dannay""?"<br> Cent' anni. It means 100 years.<br> It means we should all live happily<br> for 100 years. The family.<br> - It would be true if my father were alive.<br> - Connie.<br> Hey...<br> Merle, you've met my sister-in-law<br> Deanna.<br> - Fredo's wife.<br> - My pleasure.<br> With all respect, I didn't<br> come here to eat dinner!<br> I know, I know.<br> - I just want to dance!<br> - You're falling all over the floor.<br> You're just jealous<br> because he's a real man!<br> - I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.<br> - You couldn't belt your mama!<br> These Dagos are crazy<br> when it comes to their wives.<br> Michael says that if you can't<br> take care of this, I have to.<br> - I think you'd better.<br> - Never marry a Wop.<br> They treat their wives like shit!<br> I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!<br> What are you doing to me,<br> you big slob? Help!<br> Fredo!<br> - I can't control her, Mikey.<br> - You're my brother, don't apologise.<br> Clemenza promised the Rosato<br> brothers three territories after he died.<br> - You took over and didn't give it to them.<br> - I welched.<br> Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.<br> He promised them nothing.<br> - He hated them more than I do.<br> - Frankie, they feel cheated.<br> You're sitting up in the Sierra<br> Mountains and you're drinking...<br> - What's he drinking?<br> - Champagne.<br> ...Champagne cocktails, and passing<br> judgement on how I run my family.<br> Your family's still called Corleone.<br> And you'll run it like a Corleone.<br> My family doesn't eat here,<br> doesn't eat in Las Vegas...<br> ...and doesn't eat in Miami...<br> ...with Hyman Roth!<br> You're a good old man, and I like you.<br> You were loyal to my father for years.<br> The Rosato brothers<br> are taking hostages.<br> They spit right in my face, all because<br> they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.<br> I know. That's why I don't want<br> them touched.<br> - Not touched?<br> - No, I want you to be fair with them.<br> You want me to be fair with them?<br> How can you be fair to animals?<br> Tom, listen. They recruit spics,<br> they recruit niggers.<br> They do violence in their grandmothers'<br> neighbourhoods!<br> And everything with them is whores!<br> And junk, dope!<br> And they leave the gambling to last.<br> I want to run my family without you on<br> my back. I want those Rosatos dead!<br> - No.<br> - Morte.<br> I have business that's important with<br> Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.<br> Then you give your loyalty to a Jew<br> before your own blood.<br> You know my father did business<br> with Hyman Roth. He respected him.<br> Your father did business with Hyman<br> Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,<br> but he never trusted Hyman Roth<br> or his Sicilian messenger boy<br> Johnny Ola.<br> You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,<br> and I'm a little drunk!<br> I want everybody here to know, there's<br> not going to be no trouble from me!<br> Don Corleone.<br> Cicci, the door...<br> You want him to leave now?<br> Let him go back to New York.<br> I've already made my plans.<br> The old man had too much wine.<br> It's late.<br> How's the baby?<br> - Sleeping inside me.<br> - Does it feel like a boy?<br> Yes, it does, Michael.<br> Kay?<br> I'm sorry about all the people today.<br> Bad timing.<br> It couldn't be helped, though.<br> It made me think of what you<br> once told me.<br> In five years the Corleone family<br> will be completely legitimate.<br> That was seven years ago.<br> I know. I'm trying, darling.<br> Did you see this?<br> Why are the drapes open?<br> Kay, are you all right?<br> - Are you hit?<br> - No.<br> It's all right.<br> Stop! Stop!<br> Halt!<br> They're still on the property.<br> Please stay inside.<br> - Keep them alive.<br> - We'll try.<br> Alive!<br> Stay by the door.<br> Yeah, come in.<br> - Mike, are you all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.<br> And I know that's upset you in the past.<br> You felt it was because of<br> some lack of trust or confidence.<br> But it's because I admire you<br> and love you,<br> that I kept things secret from you.<br> Now you're the only one I can trust.<br> Fredo?<br> Well, he's got a good heart.<br> But he's weak and he's stupid,<br> and this is life and death.<br> Tom, you're my brother.<br> I always wanted to be thought of as<br> a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.<br> I know that.<br> You're going to take over.<br> You're going to be the Don.<br> If what I think has happened, has<br> happened, I'm leaving here tonight.<br> I give you complete power. Over Fredo<br> and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.<br> I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife<br> and my children, the future of this family.<br> - If we catch them, will we find out...?<br> - We won't catch them.<br> Unless I'm very wrong,<br> they're dead already.<br> They were killed by somebody<br> close to us.<br> Inside. Very, very frightened<br> that they botched it.<br> You don't think that Rocco and Neri<br> had something to do with this?<br> See... All our people are businessmen.<br> Their loyalty is based on that.<br> One thing I learned from Pop...<br> ...was to try to think<br> as people around you think.<br> On that basis, anything is possible.<br> Mike, they're dead!<br> Right outside my window!<br> I want to get out of here.<br> They're lying there dead!<br> Over here! There's two of them.<br> Looks like they were hired out of<br> New York. I don't recognise them.<br> Won't get anything out of them now.<br> Fish them out.<br> Get rid of the bodies.<br> - Where's Mike?<br> - Rocco.<br> Anthony, everything is going to be<br> all right. Try to sleep.<br> - Did you like your party?<br> - I got lots of presents.<br> I know. Did you like them?<br> Yeah. I didn't know the people<br> who gave them to me.<br> Well, they were friends.<br> - Did you see my present for you?<br> - It was on my pillow.<br> I'm going to be leaving<br> very early tomorrow.<br> - Will you take me?<br> - No, I can't, Anthony.<br> - Why do you have to go?<br> - I have to do business.<br> I could help you.<br> I know. Some day you will.<br> Get some sleep.<br> She's really beautiful.<br> You've got to see her.<br> Wait till you see her.<br> Words can't describe her.<br> I left Naples. I left Mama.<br> For a no-good tramp!<br> Now here I am in America,<br> in New York.<br> Alone! Thinking of my mother.<br> Without news from home.<br> Finally, a letter from Naples!<br> Vito, how do you like my little angel?<br> Isn't she beautiful?<br> She's very beautiful.<br> To you, she's beautiful. For me,<br> there's only my wife and son.<br> Our dear mother -<br> ...is dead!<br> We'll go backstage later<br> and take her to eat.<br> Sit down, you bum!<br> Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.<br> We'll go see her backstage.<br> Who was that?<br> The Black Hand.<br> That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.<br> We'll talk about it tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!<br> You'll pay me today!<br> Let's go.<br> Not my daughter! Let her go!<br> Here, take all my money!<br> Vito, come on.<br> I know what you're thinking. But<br> you don't know how things are.<br> Fanucci's with the Black Hand.<br> The whole neighborhood pays him.<br> Even my father, in the grocery store.<br> If he's Italian...<br> ...why does he bother other Italians?<br> He knows they have nobody<br> to protect them.<br> Forget that. Did you like my angel?<br> If you're happy, I'm happy.<br> Don't you feel well?<br> Is your boss treating you all right?<br> Forget it.<br> Hey, you speak Italian?<br> Hide this for me!<br> Next week I'll come and get it!<br> Abbandando, meet my nephew!<br> How's business?<br> It's good, it's good.<br> Fanucci's mad. Says the<br> neighborhood's getting sloppy.<br> People don't pay on time,<br> don't pay the full amount.<br> Says he's been too nice to everyone.<br> So Fanucci's changing?<br> Sure. He wants double<br> from everybody.<br> Even from my father.<br> I'm a friend, right? So you'll<br> let him work here?<br> I've got some bad news.<br> I feel rotten about telling you this...<br> But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...<br> And you have to give him my job.<br> You've always been good to me,<br> ever since I came here.<br> You looked after me like a father.<br> I thank you.<br> And I won't forget it.<br> Vito!<br> Oh, no!<br> Take this to your family.<br> Thanks anyway. But please,<br> I can't accept.<br> What a nice pear!<br> I'm Clemenza, you still<br> have my goods?<br> Did you look inside?<br> I'm not interested in things<br> that don't concern me.<br> A friend of mine has a nice rug.<br> Maybe your wife would like it.<br> Sure she would. But who has<br> money for a rug?<br> It would be a present.<br> I know how to return a favor.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> My wife would like it.<br> The son of a bitch! He isn't home!<br> Damn, he didn't even leave the key.<br> Well, he won't mind.<br> This is your friend's place?<br> This is a real palace.<br> One of the best.<br> Vito, give me a hand, will you?<br> Look how pretty it is, Santino!<br> Come on in.<br> It's all right. Hyman's in there.<br> - Would you like a tuna sandwich?<br> - No, thank you.<br> ... pick up of two by Holden.<br> Second and eight for S. C...<br> - Mr Roth?<br> - Come in, Michael.<br> Sit down, make yourself comfortable.<br> It's almost over.<br> - Do you follow the football game?<br> - Not for a while I haven't.<br> I enjoy watching football<br> in the afternoon.<br> One of the things I love<br> about this country. Baseball too.<br> Ever since Arnold Rothstein<br> fixed the World Series in 1919.<br> I heard you had some trouble.<br> Stupid.<br> People behaving like that with guns.<br> The important thing is you're all right.<br> Good health is the most important thing.<br> More than success, more than money.<br> More than power.<br> I came here because<br> there's going to be more bloodshed.<br> I wanted you to know,<br> so another war won't start.<br> Nobody wants another war.<br> Frank Pentangeli asked my permission<br> to get rid of the Rosato brothers.<br> When I refused he tried to have me<br> killed. He was stupid, I was luck.<br> I'll visit him soon.<br> The important thing is that nothing<br> interferes with our plans for the future.<br> Nothing is more important.<br> - You're a wise and considerate man.<br> - And you're a great man, Mr Roth.<br> - There's much I can learn from you.<br> - Whatever I can do to help, Michael.<br> - Excuse me. Lunch.<br> - Come in.<br> - Thank you, my dear.<br> - You're going to break your eardrums.<br> - Enjoy it.<br> - Thank you.<br> You're young, I'm old and sick.<br> What we'll do in the next few months<br> will make history.<br> It's never been done before.<br> Not even your father would dream<br> that such a thing could be possible.<br> Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.<br> You don't object?<br> He's small potatoes.<br> What's up?<br> We got company?<br> Michael Corleone is here.<br> He's in your den. You better hurry.<br> He's been waiting a half hour.<br> Is something wrong?<br> I wish you would have let me know<br> you were coming.<br> - I could have prepared something.<br> - I didn't want you to know.<br> - You heard what happened?<br> - I almost died. We were so relieved...<br> In my home!<br> In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!<br> Where my children come to play.<br> In my home.<br> I want you to help me take my revenge.<br> Michael, anything. What can I do?<br> Settle these troubles<br> with the Rosato brothers.<br> I don't understand. I don't...<br> I don't have your brain for big deals.<br> But this is a street thing.<br> That Hyman Roth in Miami.<br> He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.<br> - I know he is.<br> - So why ask me to lay down to them?<br> It was Hyman Roth<br> that tried to have me killed.<br> I know it was him.<br> Jesus Christ, Mike.<br> Jesus Christ, let's get them all.<br> Now while we've got the muscle.<br> This used to be my father's old study.<br> It's changed.<br> I remember there used to be<br> a big desk here.<br> I remember when I was a kid. We had<br> to be quiet when we played near here.<br> I was very happy that this house<br> never went to strangers.<br> First Clemenza took it over. Now you.<br> My father taught me many things here.<br> He taught me in this room.<br> "He taught me, ""Keep your friends close,<br> but your enemies closer."""<br> If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded<br> in this, in the Rosato brothers' favour,<br> he'll think his relationship with me<br> is still good.<br> That's what I want him to think.<br> I want him relaxed and confident<br> in our friendship.<br> Then I'll be able to find out<br> who the traitor in my family was.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.<br> - We need some more help.<br> - Johnny?<br> Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?<br> - Who's that, honey?<br> - Listen good, Fredo.<br> Why are you calling me?<br> I don't want to talk to you.<br> Pentangeli is going to accept<br> the Rosato brothers' deal.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - Will he come alone?<br> I don't know. You've got me in<br> deep enough already.<br> Everything will be all right. Pentangeli<br> says he's willing to make a deal.<br> All we want to know is if he's on<br> the level, or if he'll bring his boys.<br> You lied to me. I don't want you<br> to call me anymore.<br> - Your brother won't find out we talked.<br> - I don't know what you're talking about.<br> - Who was that?<br> - Wrong number.<br> - Frankie, I've got nobody here.<br> - Wait in the car, Cicc'.<br> - Frankie.<br> - That's okay, Cicc'.<br> - What's this?<br> - A luck C note for our new deal.<br> Ritchie. Give us a taste.<br> We were all real happy<br> about your decision, Frankie.<br> - You won't regret it.<br> - I don't like the C note, Rosato.<br> I take that as an insult.<br> Michael Corleone says hello!<br> Close the door!<br> Your friend the cop...<br> Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.<br> Are you open or closed?<br> I just came in to clean up a little,<br> you know?<br> What's the matter?<br> - Is that something on the floor?<br> - Carmine, not here! Anthony!<br> You open this bar<br> and I'll blow your head in!<br> Freddy, it's good to see you.<br> - How is he?<br> - He's okay. He's in the back.<br> Girls, take a hike.<br> In this room here.<br> - I want to talk to him alone first.<br> - Come on.<br> I thought I could help you, Senator.<br> Hagen?<br> - Listen, I did not...<br> - It's all right.<br> - I didn't do anything.<br> - It's okay. You're very luck.<br> My brother Fredo operates this place.<br> He was called before anyone.<br> Had this happened some place else,<br> we couldn't have helped you.<br> When I woke up, I was on the floor.<br> - And I don't know how it happened.<br> - You can't remember?<br> I passed out.<br> Just a game. Jesus.<br> Jesus, Jesus!<br> Jesus God!<br> God!<br> I don't know, and I don't understand<br> why I can't remember.<br> Doesn't matter, just do as I say.<br> Put in a call to your office.<br> Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.<br> You decided to spend the night at<br> Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.<br> - As his guest.<br> - I do remember that she was laughing.<br> We'd done it before, and I know<br> that I could not have hurt that girl.<br> This girl has no family.<br> Nobody knows that she worked here.<br> It'll be as though she never existed.<br> All that's left is our friendship.<br> - Yes?<br> - Sorry, but we're not to let you through.<br> - I'm just going to the market.<br> - We'll pick up anything you want.<br> - Whose orders are these?<br> - Mr Hagen's. He's coming.<br> I'll speak to him.<br> I wanted to explain,<br> but I had business in Carson City.<br> It's Michael's request for your safety.<br> We'll get anything you need.<br> - So I'm supposed to stay in my house?<br> - No, within the compound will be fine.<br> - We were going to New England.<br> - That's off.<br> - Am I a prisoner?<br> - That's not how we see it, Kay.<br> Come on, kids.<br> We're going back to the house.<br> Joe.<br> Cuba, Cuba!<br> Most respected gentlemen.<br> Welcome to Havana.<br> I want to thank this distinguished group<br> of American industrialists...<br> ...for continuing to work with Cuba...<br> ...for the greatest period of prosperity...<br> ...in her entire history.<br> Mr William Shaw...<br> ...representing<br> the General Fruit Company.<br> Messrs Corngold and Dant...<br> ...of United Telephone<br> and Telegraph Company.<br> Mr Petty...<br> ...regional Vice President of<br> the Pan American Mining Corporation.<br> Mr Robert Allen<br> of South American Sugar.<br> Mr Michael Corleone of Nevada...<br> ...representing our associates<br> in tourism and leisure activities.<br> And my old friend and associate<br> from Florida...<br> ...Mr Hyman Roth.<br> I would like to thank United Telephone<br> and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.<br> A solid gold telephone.<br> Perhaps you gentlemen<br> would like to look at it.<br> - Mr President?<br> - Yes?<br> Could you discuss the rebel activity and<br> what this can mean to our businesses?<br> - Of course.<br> - Heavy stuff.<br> I assure you that, although the rebels<br> have started a campaign in Las Villas...<br> ...my staff indicates, with assurance,<br> that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara<br> before the New Year.<br> I want to put you all at ease.<br> We will tolerate no guerrillas<br> in the casinos or the swimming pools.<br> He said that they're making an arrest,<br> and in a few minutes he'll let us through.<br> Johnny...<br> It's nothing.<br> Just some lousy bandits.<br> The police are cleaning them up.<br> Viva Fidel!<br> I hope my age is correct.<br> I'm always accurate about my age.<br> Make sure that everybody<br> sees the cake before we cut it.<br> I'm very pleased...<br> ...you're all able to come from<br> such distances to be with me today.<br> When a man comes to this point<br> in his life...<br> ...he wants to turn over<br> the things he's been blessed with.<br> Turn them over to friends,<br> as a reward for the friends he's had...<br> ...and to make sure that everything<br> goes well after he's gone.<br> - Not for years.<br> - Hear, hear!<br> We'll see. The doctors would disagree,<br> but what do they know?<br> These are wonderful things<br> that we've achieved in Havana,<br> and there's no limit<br> to where we can go from here.<br> This kind of government knows how to<br> help business, to encourage it.<br> The hotels here are bigger and swankier<br> than any of the joints in Vegas.<br> We can thank our friends<br> in the Cuban government,<br> which has put up half the cash with the<br> Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis,<br> and has relaxed restrictions on imports.<br> What I'm saying is that we have now<br> what we have always needed:<br> Real partnership with a government.<br> Smaller piece.<br> You all know Michael Corleone<br> and we all remember his father.<br> At the time of my retirement, or death,<br> I turn over all my interests<br> in the Havana operation to his control.<br> But, all of you will share.<br> The Nacionale will go<br> to the Lakeville Road Boys,<br> the Capri to the Corleone family,<br> the Sevilla Biltmore also,<br> but Eddie Levine will bring in the Pennino<br> brothers, Dino and Eddie, for a piece<br> and to handle the casino operations.<br> We've saved a piece<br> for some friends in Nevada<br> to make sure that things go smoothly<br> back home.<br> I want all of you to enjoy your cake.<br> So, enjoy!<br> - Happy birthday!<br> - L'chaim!<br> I saw an interesting thing happen today.<br> A rebel was being arrested<br> by the military police.<br> Rather than be taken alive, he exploded<br> a grenade he had in his jacket.<br> He killed himself and took a captain<br> of the command with him.<br> - Those rebels are lunatics.<br> - Maybe so.<br> But it occurred to me, that the soldiers<br> are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.<br> - What does that tell you?<br> - They can win.<br> This country has had rebels<br> for 50 years. It's in their blood.<br> I know, I've been coming here<br> since the Twenties.<br> We were running molasses<br> from Havana when you were a baby.<br> The trucks were owned by your father.<br> Michael...<br> I'd rather we talked about this<br> when we're alone.<br> The two million never got to the island.<br> It mustn't be known<br> that you held back the money,<br> because you worried about the rebels.<br> Sit down, Michael. Sit down.<br> If I could only live to see it,<br> to be there with you.<br> What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.<br> Here we are, protected. Free to make<br> our profits without Kefauver,<br> the goddamn Justice Department<br> and the FBI.<br> with a friendly government.<br> Just one small step for a man looking<br> to be President of the United States<br> and having the cash<br> to make it possible.<br> Michael...<br> ...we're bigger than U.S. Steel.<br> Mikey, how are you? Okay?<br> - Hi! Freddie Corleone.<br> - Mio frati.<br> Jesus Christ, what a trip!<br> "I thought, ""What if somebody knows<br> what I've got in here""."<br> Can you imagine that? Two million<br> dollars on the seat next to me.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - It's okay.<br> You want to count it?<br> What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.<br> The family is making an investment in<br> Havana. This is a gift for the President.<br> That's great! Havana's great.<br> It's my kind of town.<br> - Anybody I know in Havana?<br> - Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?<br> No. I've never met them.<br> Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...<br> ...kind of nervous from the trip.<br> Can I get a drink or something?<br> I thought maybe we'd go out together.<br> I know a place where we<br> can spend some time together.<br> Sometimes I think I should have<br> married a woman like you did. Like Kay.<br> Have kids. Have a family.<br> For once in my life, be more like...<br> ...Pop.<br> It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.<br> It's not easy.<br> "Mama used to say,<br> ""You don't belong to me."""<br> You were left on the doorstep<br> by gypsies.<br> Sometimes I think it's true.<br> You're no gypsy, Fredo.<br> Mikey... I was mad at you.<br> Why didn't we spend time<br> like this before?<br> - You want a drink, right?<br> - Waiter!<br> Por favor...<br> - How do you say Banana Daquiri?<br> - Banana Daquiri.<br> - That's it?<br> - That's it.<br> Uno Banana Daquiri...<br> ...and a club soda.<br> Senator Geary flies in from Washington<br> tomorrow with some government people.<br> I want you to show them<br> a good time in Havana.<br> - That's my speciality, right?<br> - Can I trust you with something?<br> Of course, Mike.<br> Later in the evening we're all invited to<br> the President to bring in the New Year.<br> After it's over they'll take me home<br> in a military car - alone.<br> For my protection.<br> Before I reach my hotel,<br> I'll be assassinated.<br> - Who?<br> - Roth.<br> It was Roth who tried to kill me<br> in my home.<br> It was Roth all along.<br> He acts like I'm his son, his successor.<br> But he thinks he'll live forever<br> and wants me out.<br> - How can I help?<br> - Just go along, as if you know nothing.<br> - I've already made my move.<br> - What move?<br> Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.<br> You're to take it easy,<br> he'll be back tomorrow.<br> Fly in my own doctor from Miami. I don't<br> trust a doctor who can't speak English.<br> - Gracias, seor.<br> - Buenas noches.<br> - Honey, go to the casino.<br> - If you're feeling better.<br> Feel fine.<br> - Play the bingo game.<br> - Okay. Nice to see you, Mr Paul.<br> My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought<br> a bag full of money. Where is it?<br> - You're pulling out?<br> - Just want to... Just want to wait.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - Terrible.<br> I'd give four million to be able to take<br> a painless piss.<br> - Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?<br> - The Rosato brothers.<br> I know, but who gave the go-ahead?<br> I know I didn't.<br> There was this kid I grew up with.<br> He was younger than me.<br> Sort of looked up to me, you know.<br> We did our first work together.<br> Worked our way out of the street.<br> Things were good.<br> During Prohibition<br> we ran molasses into Canada.<br> Made a fortune. Your father too.<br> As much as anyone,<br> I loved him and trusted him.<br> Later on he had an idea to build a city<br> out of a desert stop-over<br> for G.I. s going to the West Coast.<br> That kid's name was Moe Greene<br> and the city he invented was Las Vegas.<br> This was a great man.<br> A man of vision and guts.<br> And there isn't even a plaque, signpost<br> or statue of him in that town.<br> Someone put a bullet through his eye.<br> No one knows who gave the order.<br> When I heard it, I wasn't angry.<br> I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.<br> Talking loud, saying stupid things.<br> So when he turned up dead, I let it go.<br> And I said to myself,<br> This is the business we've chosen.<br> I didn't ask...<br> ...who gave the order, because it had<br> nothing to do with business.<br> That two million in a bag in your room...<br> I'm going in to take a nap.<br> When I wake, if the money<br> is on the table, I know I have a partner.<br> If it isn't, I know I don't.<br> Does everybody know everybody?<br> You know Senator Geary.<br> Good to see you, Mike.<br> I'm glad we spend this time together.<br> Senator Payton from Florida...<br> ...Judge DeMalco from New York...<br> ...Senator Ream from Maryland...<br> ...Fred Corngold from UTT.<br> - That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!<br> - He does?<br> Gentlemen, it's refill time!<br> You might try some of the local drinks.<br> Cuba Libre, Pia Colada...<br> I think I'll try<br> one of those redheaded Yolandas...<br> - That you got! Con gusto...<br> - Johnny!<br> You don't know my brother Fredo.<br> Johnny Ola, Fredo.<br> - We never met. Johnny Ola.<br> - Pleasure.<br> Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!<br> - Happy New Year!<br> - Happy New Year!<br> - Feliz Ao Nuevo!<br> - Happy New Year.<br> - Hey, Freddie, why are we standing?<br> - Everybody stands.<br> - It's worth it. You won't believe this.<br> - I don't believe it already.<br> - 50 dollars, right?<br> - You've got a bet, mister.<br> That's Superman.<br> Did I tell you or did I tell you?<br> - I don't believe it!<br> - It's got to be fake.<br> It's real. That's why he's called<br> Superman.<br> Hey, Freddy, where did you find<br> this place?<br> Johnny Ola brought me here.<br> I didn't believe it, but seeing is believing!<br> - I see it, but still don't believe it!<br> - 50 bucks, Pat.<br> Roth won't go here,<br> but Johnny knows these places!<br> - Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.<br> - I want to see him break a brick!<br> Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.<br> ...and you'll continue to get those.<br> I don't believe that President Eisenhower<br> would ever pull out of Cuba,<br> as we have over one billion dollars<br> invested in this country.<br> The American public<br> believe in non-intervention...<br> Fredo! Where are you going?<br> I'm getting a real drink,<br> because I can't...<br> What kept Mr Roth?<br> I understood he was coming.<br> Reeves, what's the protocol?<br> How long should we stay?<br> I think a half hour ought to do it. Just<br> long enough to bring in the New Year.<br> It's New Year's Eve. Come on,<br> just for a minute.<br> There's a plane waiting to take us<br> to Miami in an hour.<br> Don't make a big thing about it.<br> I know it was you, Fredo.<br> You broke my heart.<br> You broke my heart!<br> Due to serious setbacks to our<br> troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...<br> ...my position in Cuba is untenable.<br> I am resigning from office<br> to avoid further bloodshed.<br> And I shall leave the city immediately.<br> I wish all of you good luck.<br> Salud!<br> Viva la revolucin! Viva Fidel!<br> Fredo!<br> Come on. Come with me.<br> It's the only way out of here tonight.<br> Roth is dead.<br> Fredo, come with me!<br> You're still my brother.<br> Fredo!<br> I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.<br> Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!<br> Al. Get me a wet towel.<br> Does Kay know I'm back?<br> My boy? Did you get him<br> something for Christmas?<br> - I took care of it.<br> - What was it, so I'll know.<br> It was a little car with an electric motor<br> that he can ride in. It's nice.<br> Thank you, Al.<br> Fellows, could you step outside<br> for a minute?<br> Where's my brother?<br> Roth got out on a private boat.<br> He's in a hospital in Miami.<br> He had a stroke, but recovered okay.<br> Your bodyguard is dead.<br> I asked about Fredo.<br> I think he got out.<br> He must be somewhere in New York.<br> All right.<br> I want you to get in touch with him.<br> I know he's scared.<br> Tell him everything is all right.<br> Tell him I know Roth misled him. That<br> he didn't know they would try to kill me.<br> - They can come in now.<br> - There was something else.<br> What?<br> What? Come on.<br> Kay had a miscarriage.<br> - Was it a boy?<br> - At three and a half months...<br> Can't you give me a straight answer?!<br> Was it a boy?<br> I really don't know.<br> Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.<br> Young man, I hear you and<br> your friends are stealing goods.<br> But you don't even send a<br> dress to my house. No respect!<br> You know I've got three daughters.<br> This is my neighborhood.<br> You and your friends should<br> show me some respect.<br> You should let me wet<br> my beak a little.<br> I hear you and your friends<br> cleared $600 each.<br> Give me $200 each, for your own<br> protection. And I'll forget the insult.<br> You young punks have to learn<br> to respect a man like me!<br> Otherwise the cops will<br> come to your house.<br> And your family will be ruined.<br> Of course if I'm wrong about how much<br> you stole - I'll take a little less.<br> And by less, I only mean -<br> a hundred bucks less.<br> Now don't refuse me.<br> Understand, paesano?<br> I understand.<br> My friends and I share all the money.<br> So first, I have to talk to them.<br> Tell your friends I don't want a lot.<br> Just enough to wet my beak.<br> Don't be afraid to tell them!<br> Suppose we don't pay?<br> You know his gang, Tessio.<br> Real animals.<br> Maranzalla himself let Fanucci<br> work this neighborhood.<br> He's got connections with the cops, too.<br> We have to pay him.<br> $200 each... everybody agreed?<br> Why do we have to pay him?<br> Vito, leave this to us.<br> He's one person, we're three.<br> He's got guns, we've got guns.<br> Why should we give him the<br> money we sweated for?<br> This is his neighborhood!<br> I know two bookies who don't give<br> anything to Fanucci.<br> They don't pay Fanucci.<br> If they don't pay Fanucci, then<br> somebody else collects for Maranzalla!<br> We'll all be better off if we<br> pay him. Don't worry.<br> Now what I say stays in this room.<br> If you both like, why not give me<br> $50 each to pay Fanucci?<br> I guarantee he'll accept<br> what I give him.<br> If Fanucci says $200...<br> ...he means it, Vito!<br> I'll reason with him.<br> Leave everything to me.<br> I'll take care of everything.<br> I never lie to my friends.<br> Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.<br> He'll ask for the money.<br> Tell him you'll pay whatever<br> he wants. Don't argue with him.<br> Then I'll go and get him to agree.<br> Don't argue with him, since<br> he's so tough.<br> How can you get him to take less?<br> That's my business.<br> Just remember that I did you a favor.<br> Is it a deal?<br> His family's out of the house.<br> Fanucci's alone in the cafe.<br> Vito, here's my 50 dollars.<br> Buona fortuna.<br> Are you sure he's going to go for it?<br> I'll make an offer he don't refuse.<br> Don't worry.<br> It looks like there's -<br> $100 under my hat.<br> I was right.<br> Only $100...<br> I'm short of money right now.<br> I've been out of work... so just<br> give me a little time.<br> You understand, don't you?<br> You've got balls, young man!<br> How come I never heard<br> of you before?<br> You've got a lot of guts.<br> I'll find you some work<br> for good money.<br> No hard feelings, right? If I can<br> help you, let me know.<br> You've done well for yourself.<br> Enjoy the festa!<br> Oh, this is too violent for me!<br> What've you got there?<br> Michael, your father loves you<br> very much.<br> Mr Cicci, from the year 1942<br> to the present time,<br> you were an employee<br> of the Genco Olive Oil Company?<br> That's right.<br> But in actuality you were a member<br> of the Corleone crime organisation.<br> No, we called it<br> the Corleone family, Senator.<br> What was your position?<br> At first, like everybody else,<br> I was a soldier.<br> - What is that?<br> - A button, you know, Senator.<br> No, I don't know. Tell me.<br> "When the boss says ""push a button"" on<br> a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?"<br> Mr Questadt.<br> You mean you kill people?<br> You kill people at the...<br> behest of your superiors.<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> And the head of your family<br> is Michael Corleone?<br> Yeah, Counsellor. Michael Corleone.<br> Did you ever get such an order<br> directly from Michael Corleone?<br> No, I never talked to him.<br> Mr Cicci, could you amplify<br> your answer a bit?<br> - Do what?<br> - Could you expand on your answer?<br> I'm particularly interested in knowing,<br> was there always a buffer involved?<br> Someone in between you<br> and your superiors who gave the order.<br> Right, a buffer.<br> The family had a lot of buffers!<br> You may find this very amusing, but<br> the members of this committee do not.<br> Tell me something, Ma.<br> What did Papa think...<br> deep in his heart?<br> He was being strong...<br> Strong for his family.<br> But by being strong for his family...<br> ...could he...<br> ...lose it?<br> You're thinking about your wife...<br> about the baby you lost.<br> But you and your wife can<br> always have another baby.<br> No, I meant... lose his family.<br> But you can never lose your family.<br> Times are changing.<br> It's my pleasure.<br> I don't want money.<br> Take it as a gift.<br> If there's something I can do for you,<br> you come, we talk.<br> Signora Colombo, why did you<br> come to see me?<br> Your wife told me to ask<br> if you could help me.<br> She's in bad trouble.<br> Her neighbors complained to the<br> landlord about her dog.<br> He told her to get rid of the animal.<br> But her little boy loves that dog.<br> So she hid it.<br> When the landlord found out, he<br> got mad and told her to leave.<br> Now she can't stay even if she<br> gets rid of it.<br> I'm so ashamed!<br> He said he'd get the police to<br> throw us out on the street.<br> I'm sorry, but...<br> I could give you a couple dollars<br> to help you move.<br> I can't move!<br> I want you to talk to him!<br> Tell him I want to stay here!<br> What's your landlord's name?<br> His name is Signor Roberto.<br> He lives on Fourth Street, near here.<br> They break the windows,<br> they dirty the floors...<br> A real pig-sty, eh?<br> My name is Vito Corleone.<br> Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.<br> She says she's been evicted<br> for no good reason.<br> She's a poor widow, she has nobody<br> to take care of her.<br> She has no relatives, no money.<br> All she has is this neighborhood.<br> I already rented the place<br> to another family.<br> I told her that I'd talk to you.<br> That you're a reasonable man.<br> She got rid of the animal that<br> caused all the trouble.<br> So let her stay.<br> Impossible.<br> Are you Sicilian?<br> No, I'm Calabrese.<br> We're practically paesani,<br> do me this favor.<br> I already rented it!<br> I'll look like an idiot.<br> Besides, the new tenants<br> pay more rent.<br> How much more a month?<br> Five bucks.<br> Here's six months increase in advance.<br> But don't tell her about it.<br> She's very proud.<br> Come see me in another six months.<br> Of course, the dog stays. Right?<br> The dog stays.<br> Who the hell are you<br> to come give me orders?<br> Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass<br> right into the street!<br> Do me this favor.<br> I won't forget it.<br> Ask your friends in the<br> neighborhood about me.<br> They'll tell you I know how<br> to return a favor.<br> What a character!<br> That landlord is here... Roberto,<br> the one who owns those ratholes.<br> He's been asking all around<br> the neighborhood about you.<br> I hope I'm not disturbing you,<br> Don Vito.<br> What can I do for you, Don Roberto?<br> What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!<br> Of course Signora Colombo can stay!<br> I'm giving back the money you gave me.<br> Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!<br> Because after all, Don Vito,<br> money isn't everything.<br> Can I sit down?<br> Your kindness to that widow<br> made me ashamed of myself.<br> The rent stays like before!<br> I'll even lower it.<br> I'll lower it $5.<br> I'll lower it $10!<br> Can I offer you some coffee?<br> I'm late for an appointment! I can't<br> this time! Ask me another time!<br> You'll have to excuse me for now.<br> I wish I could stay longer!<br> Just call me and I'll be here!<br> He won't be back. He'll hide out<br> in the Bronx!<br> - Vito, what do you think?<br> - We'll make a big business!<br> Would you speak up, please?<br> New York City.<br> - Are you the son of Vito Corleone?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Where was he born?<br> - Corleone, Sicily.<br> Did he at times use an alias that was<br> known in certain circles as Godfather?<br> Godfather is a term used by his friends.<br> One of affection and respect.<br> Mr Chairman, I would like to verify<br> the witness' statement.<br> For years many of my constituents<br> have been of Italian descent.<br> I've come to know them well.<br> They have honoured me<br> with their support and their friendship.<br> I can proudly say that some of my<br> very best friends are Italian-Americans.<br> However, Mr Chairman, unfortunately<br> I have to leave these proceedings,<br> in order to preside over a very important<br> meeting of my own committee.<br> Before I leave, I do want to say this,<br> that these hearings on the Mafia<br> are in no way whatsoever<br> a slur upon the great Italian people.<br> I can state from my own knowledge<br> and experience<br> that Italian-Americans are among<br> the most loyal, most law-abiding,<br> patriotic, hard-working<br> American citizens in this land.<br> It would be a shame, Mr Chairman,<br> if we allowed a few rotten apples<br> to give a bad name to the whole barrel.<br> Because from the time of Christopher<br> Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi,<br> to the present day,<br> Italian-Americans have been pioneers<br> in building and defending our nation.<br> They are the salt of the earth, and<br> one of the backbones of this country.<br> I'm sure we all agree<br> with our esteemed colleague.<br> Mr Corleone, you have been advised<br> as to your legal rights.<br> We have testimony from<br> a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.<br> He stated that you are head of the most<br> powerful Mafia family in the country.<br> - Are you?<br> - No, I'm not.<br> He testified that you are personally<br> responsible<br> for the murder of a New York<br> police captain in 1947,<br> and with him a man<br> named Virgil Sollozzo.<br> - Do you deny this?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Is it true that in the year 1950<br> "you devised the murder of the heads<br> of the ""Five Families"" in New York,"<br> to assume and consolidate<br> your nefarious power?<br> - It's a complete falsehood.<br> - Mr Questadt.<br> Is it true you have a controlling interest<br> in three major hotels in Las Vegas?<br> No, it's not true. I own some stock in<br> some of the hotels there, but very little.<br> I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.<br> Do you have any control over gambling<br> and narcotics in New York State?<br> No, I do not.<br> Senator, my client would like to<br> read a statement.<br> Mr Chairman, I think this statement<br> is totally out of order at this time.<br> Sir, my client has answered this<br> committee's questions with sincerity.<br> He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,<br> so this statement should be heard!<br> No, I'll allow Mr Corleone to read<br> his statement. I'll put it in the record.<br> In the hopes of clearing<br> my family name,<br> to give my children their share<br> of the American way of life<br> without a blemish on their name<br> and background,<br> I have appeared before this committee<br> and given it all my cooperation.<br> I consider it a great personal dishonour<br> to have to deny that I am a criminal.<br> I wish to have the following noted<br> for the record:<br> That I served my country faithfully<br> in World War Two<br> and was awarded the Navy Cross<br> for actions in defence of my country.<br> That I have never been arrested<br> or indicted for any crime.<br> That no proof linking me to any<br> criminal conspiracy,<br> whether it is called Mafia<br> or Cosa Nostra or any other name,<br> has ever been made public.<br> I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth<br> Amendment, although I may do so.<br> I challenge this committee to produce<br> any witness or evidence against me,<br> and if they do not, I hope they will have<br> the decency to clear my name<br> with the same publicity<br> with which they have besmirched it.<br> I'm sure we're impressed. Particularly<br> with your love for our country.<br> We'll be in recess until 10 a.m. Monday,<br> when we will produce a witness who'll<br> corroborate the charges against you.<br> At which time you may very well<br> be subject to indictment for perjury.<br> I remind you that you're still<br> under subpoena. Adjourned!<br> Ten-to-one shot, you said.<br> He would take the Fifth, and I'd lose.<br> You sound like my bookie.<br> I owe that monkey my life.<br> - Well, just get a good night's sleep.<br> - Yeah.<br> You've got a big day tomorrow.<br> I've got you a new suit,<br> new shirt, new tie.<br> I'll shave you myself in the morning.<br> You'll look respectable for 50 million<br> of your fellow Americans.<br> Tomorrow... My life won't be worth<br> a nickel after tomorrow.<br> Come on! I saw this 19 times.<br> You've got a great home here,<br> for the rest of your life.<br> Nobody gets near you,<br> you're not going anywhere.<br> That's great. Beautiful.<br> Some deal I made.<br> You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.<br> You'll live better here<br> than most people outside.<br> Some deal!<br> Alive. Pentangeli is alive.<br> - How did they get their hands on him?<br> - Roth. He engineered it, Michael.<br> When Frankie went to make a deal with<br> the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.<br> He thought you double-crossed him.<br> Our people with the detectives<br> said he was half dead, scared,<br> and shouted that you'd turned on him.<br> They already had him on possession,<br> bookmaking, murder one and more.<br> The FBI has him airtight. He's on<br> an army base, 24 hour guards.<br> We can't get to him. You've opened<br> yourself to five counts of perjury.<br> What about Fredo?<br> What does he know?<br> He says he doesn't know anything,<br> and I believe him.<br> Roth, he... played this one beautifully.<br> I'm going to talk to Fredo.<br> I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.<br> We have time.<br> I was kept pretty much in the dark.<br> I didn't know all that much.<br> What about now? Is there anything<br> you can help me out with?<br> Anything you can tell me now?<br> They've got Pentangeli.<br> I didn't know it was going to be<br> a hit, Mike.<br> I swear to God I didn't know.<br> Johnny Ola bumped into me<br> in Beverly Hills.<br> He said that he wanted to talk.<br> He said that you and Roth<br> were in on a big deal together.<br> And that there was something in it<br> for me if I could help him out.<br> He said that you were being tough<br> on the negotiations,<br> but if they could get a little help<br> and close the deal fast...<br> ...it would be good for the family.<br> And you believed that story?<br> You believed that?<br> He said there was something in it<br> for me, on my own!<br> - I've always taken care of you, Fredo.<br> - Taken care of me?!<br> You're my kid brother!<br> You take care of me?<br> Did you ever think about that?<br> Did you ever once think about that?<br> Send Fredo off to do this,<br> send Fredo off to do that!<br> Let Fredo take care of some<br> Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere.<br> Let Fredo fetch somebody at the airport!<br> I'm your older brother,<br> but was stepped over!<br> - It's the way Pop wanted it.<br> - It's not the way I wanted it!<br> I can handle things, I'm smart!<br> Not like everybody says.<br> Like dumb. I'm smart<br> and I want respect!<br> Is there anything you can tell me about<br> this investigation? Anything more?<br> The senate lawyer, Questadt...<br> He belongs to Roth.<br> Fredo...<br> ...you're nothing to me now.<br> Not a brother, not a friend.<br> I don't want to know you,<br> or what you do.<br> I don't want to see you at the hotels.<br> I don't want you near my house.<br> When you see our mother, I want to<br> know in advance, so I won't be there.<br> You understand?<br> Mikey.<br> I don't want anything to happen to him<br> while my mother's alive.<br> There's more people<br> than at a ballgame in here.<br> - Hey, there's Willi Cicci!<br> - Frankie Five-Angels...<br> This committee will come to order!<br> - State your name, please.<br> - Frank Pentangeli.<br> - Where were you born?<br> - Pontenegro, it's outside of Palermo.<br> Where do you live now?<br> I live in an army barracks<br> with the FBI guys.<br> We have here a witness<br> that will further testify<br> to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal<br> empire that controls all gambling.<br> This witness has had no buffer between<br> himself and Michael Corleone.<br> He can corroborate enough charges<br> for us to recommend a charge<br> of perjury against Michael Corleone.<br> - Senator.<br> - Thank you, Chairman.<br> Mr Pentangeli...<br> Mr Pentangeli. Were you a member<br> of the Corleone family?<br> Did you serve under Caporegime,<br> Peter Clemenza,<br> and under Vito Corleone,<br> also known as the Godfather?<br> I never knew any Godfather.<br> I have my own family.<br> Mr Pentangeli, you...<br> You are contradicting<br> your own sworn statement.<br> I ask you again, sir, here and now<br> under oath,<br> were you at any time a member of a crime<br> organisation led by Michael Corleone?<br> I don't know nothing about that!<br> I was in the olive oil business<br> with his father,<br> but that was a long time ago.<br> We have a sworn affidavit.<br> Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered<br> on the orders of Michael Corleone.<br> Do you deny this confession, and do<br> you realise what will happen if you do?<br> The FBI guys promised me a deal,<br> so I made up a lot of stuff about<br> Michael Corleone, just to please them.<br> But it was all lies. Everything!<br> They kept saying,<br> "Michael Corleone did this<br> and ""Michael Corleone did that""."<br> "So I said, ""Yeah, sure. Why not?"""<br> Mr Corleone, would you kindly identify<br> the gentleman sitting to your left?<br> I can answer that.<br> His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.<br> - Is he related to the witness?<br> - He is, I believe, his brother.<br> - Will he come forward and be sworn?<br> - He doesn't understand English.<br> He came at his own expense<br> to aid his brother.<br> He's not under subpoena<br> and has an impeccable reputation.<br> - He knows nothing about this?<br> - To my knowledge, nothing.<br> I'm going to find out what happened!<br> This committee is now adjourned.<br> - The witness is excused.<br> - Senator!<br> Senator! This committee<br> owes an apology!<br> This committee owes an apology.<br> Apology, Senator!<br> - Michael, excuse me.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> The children are outside. We're going.<br> What do you mean?<br> We're leaving tomorrow.<br> Rocco?<br> I'll be in my room, Mike.<br> Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.<br> I brought the children<br> to say goodbye to you.<br> I'm very happy for you.<br> I always knew you were too smart<br> to let any of them beat you.<br> - Why don't you sit down?<br> - No, I'm not going to stay long.<br> There are some things<br> I'd like to talk to you about.<br> Things that have been on my mind,<br> changes I want to make.<br> I think it's too late for changes, Michael.<br> "- I wasn't going to say anything...<br> - What do you mean, ""too late""?"<br> What really happened with Pentangeli?<br> - His brother came and helped him.<br> - I didn't even know he had a brother.<br> Where is he now?<br> He's on a plane, back to Sicily.<br> All he had to do was show his face.<br> It was between the brothers, Kay.<br> I had nothing to do with it.<br> Don't tell me you're going.<br> Not you, not the kids. No.<br> You're my wife and my children.<br> I love you and won't allow it.<br> You say you love me,<br> but talk about allowing me to leave!<br> Things between men and women<br> will not change.<br> You've become blind!<br> Look what's happened to us.<br> - Look what's happened to our son!<br> - Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!<br> - Anthony is not fine!<br> - I don't want to hear about it.<br> - Anthony is...<br> - I don't want to hear about it!<br> Over!<br> At this moment<br> I feel no love for you at all.<br> I never thought that would ever happen,<br> but it has.<br> Kay...<br> We're leaving tomorrow.<br> Why don't you take the kids<br> back to their room?<br> - Michael, you haven't heard me.<br> - Kay, what do you want from me?<br> Do you expect me to let you go,<br> to let you take my children from me?<br> Don't you know me? Don't you know<br> that that's an impossibility?<br> That I'd use all my power<br> to keep that from happening?<br> Don't you know that?<br> Kay...<br> In time, you'll feel differently.<br> You'll be glad I stopped you now.<br> I know that.<br> I know you blame me<br> for losing the baby.<br> Yes.<br> I know what that meant to you.<br> I'll make it up to you, Kay.<br> I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...<br> I'm going to change.<br> I'll change. I've learned that I have<br> the strength to change.<br> Then you'll forget about<br> this miscarriage...<br> ...and we'll have another child.<br> And we'll go on, you and I.<br> - We'll go on.<br> - Oh, Michael!<br> Michael, you are blind.<br> It wasn't a miscarriage.<br> It was an abortion.<br> An abortion, Michael.<br> Just like our marriage is an abortion.<br> Something that's unholy and evil!<br> I didn't want your son, Michael!<br> I wouldn't bring another one<br> of your sons into this world!<br> It was an abortion, Michael.<br> It was a son - and I had it killed<br> because this must all end!<br> I know now that it's over. I knew it then.<br> There would be no way, Michael,<br> no way you could ever forgive me.<br> Not with this Sicilian thing<br> that's been going on for 2,000...<br> - You won't take my children.<br> - I will.<br> - You won't take my children!<br> - They're my children too.<br> Fredo, give this to Grandmother.<br> Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.<br> Allow me the honor of<br> introducing someone.<br> My partner in America, in New York.<br> His name is Vito Corleone.<br> We'll send him olive oil from here.<br> To his company in America.<br> They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.<br> We'd like your blessing, and your<br> permission to start work.<br> Where is this young man<br> from New York?<br> Have him come closer.<br> I can't see him so good.<br> My respects, Don Ciccio.<br> Give me your blessing.<br> Bless you!<br> What's your name?<br> You took the name of this town!<br> And what's your father's name?<br> His name was... Antonio Andolini.<br> Louder, I don't hear so good.<br> My father's name was<br> Antonio Andolini...<br> ...and this is for you!<br> Michael, say goodbye.<br> Hi, Al.<br> Can I speak with you<br> for a second, Tom?<br> Tom, where's Mike?<br> Waiting for you to leave.<br> - Can I talk with him?<br> - Sorry, Fredo. No chance.<br> - Can I see him?<br> - He's in the boathouse.<br> Michael, it's Connie.<br> Michael...<br> I'd like to stay close to home now,<br> if it's all right.<br> Is Kay coming?<br> No.<br> Fredo's in the house with Mama.<br> He asked for you<br> and Tom said you wouldn't see him.<br> That's right.<br> Kids, why don't you go outside<br> for a while?<br> Please, I want to talk to you.<br> Michael, I hated you for so many years.<br> I think I did things to myself,<br> to hurt myself, so that you'd know...<br> ...that I could hurt you.<br> You were just being strong for all of us,<br> the way Papa was.<br> And I forgive you.<br> Can't you forgive Fredo?<br> He's so sweet,<br> and helpless without you.<br> You need me.<br> I want to take care of you now.<br> Connie...<br> Tom, sit down.<br> Our friend and business partner,<br> Hyman Roth, is in the news.<br> - Did you hear about it?<br> - I hear that he's in Israel.<br> The High Court in Israel<br> turned down his request to live there.<br> His passport's been invalidated,<br> except to return here.<br> He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.<br> He offered them a million dollars<br> if they'd let him live there.<br> - They turned him down.<br> - He's going to try Panama.<br> Panama won't take him.<br> Not for a million, not for ten million.<br> His condition is reported as terminal.<br> He's only got six months left.<br> He's had the same heart attack<br> for 20 years.<br> - That plane goes to Miami.<br> - That's right. That's where I want it met.<br> Impossible. They'll turn him over to the<br> Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.<br> It's not impossible.<br> Nothing's impossible.<br> - There's no way we can get to him!<br> - Tom, you surprise me.<br> If anything in this life is certain...<br> ...if history has taught us anything...<br> ...it's that you can kill anyone.<br> - Rocco?<br> - Difficult. Not impossible.<br> Good.<br> Why did you ask me if something<br> was wrong when I came in?<br> I thought you were going to tell me that<br> you're moving your family to Vegas...<br> ...and that you'd been offered the Vice<br> Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.<br> - I thought you'd tell me that.<br> - Must I tell you every offer I turn down?<br> - Let's do business.<br> - All right.<br> Just consider this, Michael.<br> Just consider it.<br> Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.<br> Are they worth it, are we strong enough?<br> Is it worth it? You've won.<br> Do you want to wipe everybody out?<br> I don't feel I have to wipe everybody<br> out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.<br> Are you with me in these things,<br> or what?<br> Because if not, you can take your wife,<br> your family and your mistress,<br> and move them all to Las Vegas.<br> Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've<br> always been loyal to you. What is this?<br> So... you're staying?<br> Yes, I'm staying.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Hey, Anthony...<br> How would you like it if I taught you<br> how to catch the really big fish?<br> - Would you like that?<br> - Okay.<br> You know, when I was your age...<br> ...I went out fishing with all my brothers<br> and my father. Everybody.<br> I was the only one that caught a fish.<br> Nobody else could catch one.<br> Do you know how I did it?<br> Every time I put the line in the water<br> I said a Hail Mary<br> and every time I said a Hail Mary,<br> I caught a fish.<br> Do you believe that? It's true.<br> That's the secret.<br> - Do you want to try it out on the lake?<br> - Okay.<br> What else have you got?<br> Everything will be okay.<br> - Did my brother go back?<br> - Yeah, don't worry.<br> He's ten times tougher than me,<br> my brother. He's old-fashioned.<br> He didn't want dinner,<br> just wanted to go home.<br> That's my brother! Nothing could get<br> him away from that two-mule town.<br> He could have been big here.<br> He could have had his own family.<br> Tom...<br> ...what do I do now?<br> Frankie...<br> You were always interested<br> in politics and history.<br> I remember you talking about Hitler<br> back in '33.<br> Yeah, I still read a lot.<br> I get good stuff in there.<br> You were around the old-timers, who<br> built the organisation of the families,<br> "basing them on the old Roman legions,<br> with ""regimes"", ""capos"" and ""soldiers""."<br> - And it worked.<br> - Yeah, it worked.<br> Those were the great old days,<br> you know.<br> We was like the Roman Empire.<br> The Corleone family<br> was like the Roman Empire.<br> Yeah...<br> ...it was once.<br> Frankie...<br> When a plot against the Emperor failed...<br> ...the plotters were always<br> given a chance...<br> ...to let their families keep their fortunes.<br> Right?<br> Only the rich guys.<br> The little guys got knocked off and all<br> their estates went to the Emperors.<br> Unless they went home and killed<br> themselves, then nothing happened.<br> And their families were taken care of.<br> That was a good break, a nice deal.<br> Yeah.<br> They went home...<br> ...and sat in a hot bath...<br> ...opened up their veins...<br> ...and bled to death.<br> And sometimes they had a little party<br> before they did it.<br> Don't worry about anything,<br> Frankie Five-Angels.<br> Thanks, Tom. Thanks.<br> - See you, Tom.<br> - Addio, Frankie.<br> Kay... You have to go.<br> - So pretty...<br> - Kay, please hurry. He's coming.<br> Anthony...
