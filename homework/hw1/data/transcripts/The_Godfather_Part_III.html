Let's go.<br> We trusted you to manage<br> our money in the casinos.<br> lt's not even 20 years. You've sold the<br> casinos and made fortunes for all of us.<br> Bravo, Don Corleone!<br> Thank you.<br> Friends, l have come here<br> because our business together is done.<br> We have prospered,<br> and now it is time for us to dissolve<br> the business relationship between us.<br> That's it.<br> But l do have a little surprise. Al?<br> Your shares in the casinos.<br> l've cut the red tape, so you could<br> get your money right away.<br> - Not everybody gets the same.<br> - Nothing for you...<br> - lt depends on your investment.<br> - Michael, this is really generous!<br> Wonderful!<br> - Parisi, how much did you invest?<br> - l don't remember.<br> You're blessed.<br> My family has done much of<br> the hard work, taken many risks.<br> All to make money<br> for the rest of the families.<br> You all know Joey Zasa.<br> He is, l admit, an important man.<br> His picture is on the cover<br> of the New York Times magazine.<br> He gets the Esquire Magazine award<br> for the best dressed gangster.<br> The newspapers praise him<br> because he hires Blacks,<br> which shows he has a good heart.<br> He is famous.<br> Who knows? Maybe one day<br> he'll make all of you popular.<br> lt's true.<br> l make more of a bella figura.<br> That is my nature.<br> But l also want to make a move<br> into legitimate enterprises.<br> l'd like a little pin from the Pope.<br> Sure, l take the Blacks and the Spanish<br> into my family,<br> because that's America.<br> And you guarantee<br> that they don't deal drugs?<br> l don't guarantee that. l guarantee<br> that l'll kill anybody who does.<br> - Let me talk to him.<br> - Who can refuse Don Altobello?<br> - Joey, are you...<br> - No!<br> l say to all of you: l have been<br> treated this day with no respect.<br> l've earned you all money. l've made<br> you rich and l asked for little.<br> Good. You will not give, so l'll take!<br> As for Don Corleone,<br> he makes it very clear to me today<br> that he is my enemy.<br> You must choose between us.<br> No, Joey!<br> Michael, we could reason together.<br> No.<br> Michael, please... let's agree.<br> He doesn't know what he's...<br> No, no.<br> Michael, the news is everywhere.<br> Everyone says that you<br> control lmmobiliare.<br> lmmobiliare is already laundering<br> money in Peru and Nassau.<br> We've worked with you for 40 years.<br> We should wet our beaks a little.<br> - We want to do business with you.<br> - That's right, we've been together...<br> - lt's a hit!

We're out of here.<br> - You did good, Vincent.<br> - Grazie.<br> The old Dons were pretty much<br> wiped out.<br> The survivors made deals with Zasa.<br> - Altobello?<br> - He survived.<br> He's with his daughters in Staten lsland.<br> He says he's going to retire in Sicily.<br> Joey Zasa would never pull something<br> like this without the backing.<br> He's just muscle. He doesn't have<br> the wit for that helicopter attack.<br> He doesn't even have the ambition<br> to wipe out the whole Commission.<br> l say we hit back and take Zasa out!<br> Never let anyone know<br> what you're thinking.<br> Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.<br> l respect what he's done.<br> The new overthrows the old. lt's natural.<br> How can you do business<br> with this guy?<br> l'm a businessman, first and foremost.<br> l want no further conflict.<br> - Tell him that he can live or he can die.<br> - Vincent, will you shut up!<br> That's it.<br> Joey Zasa...<br> He can't be doing this alone.<br> Just when l thought l was out,<br> they pull me back in.<br> Our true enemy has not yet<br> shown his face.<br> Michael!<br> - Has he had his medicine?<br> - l don't know what he took.<br> - l've got my wind back.<br> - Call a doctor.<br> - Run, run, run!<br> - Vincent!<br> Run at thunder, girl!

Dad!<br> Excuse me.<br> l'll call Kay.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.<br> Mr Harrison, you said it was urgent.<br> Have you come to confess your sins?<br> Michael Corleone has had a diabetic<br> stroke. l wanted you to know about it.<br> He's in a coma. l'm here to insist<br> the deal goes through in any event.<br> The Pope has not much time left.<br> So, as you, l am in a difficult position.<br> We have to ratify this deal<br> as soon as possible.<br> - We have an understanding.<br> - Good.<br> - l'm going to the hospital.<br> - l'll pray for Mr Corleone.<br> - Our thoughts are with Mr Corleone.<br> - Thank you, Father Jim.<br> Everything would be out in the open<br> if Corleone dies.<br> Play for time, Keinszig.<br> A habit born of a long contemplation<br> of eternity.<br> - Forget about it, Vinnie.<br> - Why? lt's a simple hit.<br> l'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then<br> whack the fag. But it's impossible.<br> He's always with people, in front of TV<br> cameras in his own neighbourhood.<br> - lt's not impossible. lt'll work for us.<br> - How?<br> Do you think he's going to let<br> Uncle Michael survive? Would you?<br> He may not survive anyway.<br> - How would you do it?<br> - l'd do it myself.<br> Do it!<br> - What would you need?<br> - A couple of guys.<br> Hello, Michael.<br> lt's Kay.<br> Kay...<br> l never expected you.<br> No, l know.<br> But l'm here.<br> - l'm glad.<br> - You know...<br> l've never seen you looking so helpless.<br> lt's not so bad, really.<br> l feel... l'm getting wiser now.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - The sicker you get, the wiser you get?<br> - When l'm dead, l'll be really smart.<br> Michael... l want to thank you for Tony.<br> He's doing really well.<br> He's gotten some very good notices,<br> and he'll make his operatic debut<br> in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...<br> So, thank you.<br> That's a real honour. ln Sicily.<br> l will be there. l won't miss that.<br> l won't miss that.<br> Mary, Tony...<br> Go see Dad.<br> - Sweetheart!<br> - Everything's going to be all right.<br> - Tony!<br> - How are you doing, Pop?<br> Your mother told me what happened.<br> - About Palermo? l hope you'll be there.<br> - Of course.

They are the true Mafia.<br> The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,<br> that's the big problem.<br> They're the same problem.<br> B.J., they're connected.<br> The Archbishop has powerful friends.<br> They totally protect him.<br> ls there someone in the<br> Church we can turn to?<br> Someone we can tell<br> our problem to?<br> Cardinal Lamberto.<br> A wise and good man...<br> very influential.<br> He will see you.<br> l will see this Cardinal Lamberto<br> and see if we can work things out.<br> You honour your agreements,<br> but you are dealing with crooks.<br> They have no honour.<br> My word is final.<br> Politics and crime,<br> they're the same thing.<br> l've invited you all here to celebrate<br> my son's debut in an opera house...<br> We'll play ''Philadelphia''.<br> Seven cards. Two down, four up.<br> Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.<br> ...in the opera ''Cavallaria Rusticana''.<br> - lt's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'', Dad.<br> - ''Cavalleria''.<br> l think l have tickets to the wrong opera.<br> l've been in New York too long.<br> You will all receive tickets,<br> so come on time.<br> Dad, l've got a present for you.<br> lt comes from the town of Corleone<br> and it's authentic Sicilian.<br> And... l learned it for you.<br> She was wonderful, beautiful.<br> l loved her. And then she died.<br> My trusted bodyguard<br> planted a bomb in my car.<br> She drove it before l did.<br> Why is such a beautiful country<br> so violent?<br> History.<br> Mom was telling me about when your<br> biggest worry was passing your exams.<br> - Yes, it was then.<br> - l worry about you now.<br> Oh, Mary, you're such a<br> warm-hearted girl. You always were.<br> - l love my family.<br> - Even your cousin Vincent?<br> l really love him.<br> - He's your first cousin.<br> - Then l love him first.<br> Mary, you can't see him.<br> Just don't see him anymore.<br> He's right. lt's too dangerous.<br> Mary, you can't see him anymore.<br> - Not in that fashion.<br> - No.<br> - Please, promise me.<br> - No!<br> - Obey me on this.<br> - No, Dad!<br> Mary is smart, Dad.<br> She'll understand eventually.<br> Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.<br> - You wanted to see me?<br> - Yeah.<br> l want you to do something for me.<br> lt's dangerous.<br> Good. l'm in. What do you need?<br> l want you to sell your soul<br> to Don Altobello.<br> To betray me.<br> He'd never believe me.<br> - That depends.<br> - Sit down.<br> l have an idea.<br> See if you can learn<br> how high Altobello is connected.<br> Arrange a meeting.<br> You say how devoted you are to me.<br> Tell him your problems.<br> - Ask for his help.<br> - What problems?<br> That you want to run away<br> with my daughter.<br> But you know that if you do,<br> l will become your enemy.<br> - You know that l would never do that.<br> - l know.<br> Ask Altobello to speak to me.<br> To further the marriage.<br> But you're cousins, after all.
