I'm not afraid!<br> I go to the Great House to say,<br> to tell'em<br> I've got an important business<br> Money is concerned<br> What is a fair price,<br> I have it in my hand!<br> Well it was a good thought<br> But what use is a good thought then?<br> If no one agrees with it?<br> And the child!

Must I waste the whole day?<br> Hey hey hey!<br> He's a beautiful child!<br> He's a beautiful child!<br> Hey hey hey!<br> You won't believe she laughed!<br> And say he's a beautiful child!<br> She said those words<br> "a beautiful child"!<br> Well she said no more than the truths!<br> And I saw not<br> one slave in all that house<br> with a new coat like mine!<br> And why should you go about<br> like a wife of a common fellow?<br> I can afford a piece of cloth I think!<br> Now I have 2 fields!<br> I bought it today from the Great House!<br> The land?<br> They said it was less than an inch<br> And took all that silver<br> as if it were nothing!<br> And the foolish clerks<br> who don't own a foot land<br> laughed the goose clack at me<br> 'cause I couldn't write my name!<br> But I'll buy again and again!<br> Until my land is more than an inch!<br> Even in a house of a prince!<br> Look here farmer!<br> Someday all this will belong to you!<br> And you'll be a prince too!<br> And I'll buy more land<br> and more land and...<br> What a pity!

Only a female,<br> and covered with small pox,<br> as well!<br> You mighty gods! You wise gods!<br> You've been good to me, for many years<br> you've been good to this humble person;<br> I had only 1 field, now I have 5!<br> I had only 1 child, now I have 3!<br> My eldest son<br> planted his first rice today!<br> My youngest son<br> is big enough to lead the ox!<br> My third child is only a female,<br> but I won't reproach you for that!<br> Excuse me!<br> Now we haven't forgotten you!<br> We brought you<br> fine new rogues of red paper<br> so you won't forget me!<br> You send me rich harvest this year also<br> and you persuade my uncle,<br> to work a little now and then.<br> And not ask for money so often<br> And if he does,<br> please allow my husband to refuse him!<br> I'll do that anyway!<br> Very gracefully!<br> Wong Loong! Come up!<br> Wong Loong come up here!<br> Wong Loong!<br> Wong Loong will know,<br> he'll know what it is!<br> Wong Loong! How would he know?<br> He is as slow witted as my woman!<br> Hey hey! Well! And what now?<br> Look! Look!<br> An army!<br> No! Virgins perhaps?<br> So many?<br> People from the North! But why?<br> There must be famine in the North!<br> They're going south where there's food!<br> Famine!? Ha ha ha!<br> What ideas you have!<br> The woman is right!<br> I have seen it before!<br> That's what happens<br> when a man has only 1 field!<br> But I have 5!<br> We must thank the gods<br> for giving me so much foresight!<br> What talk is this!?<br> Forgive him!<br> My son he's young and stupid<br> and talks too much!<br> It was famine that made me a slave!<br> It dries even if we carry it!<br> Well if the vines starve,<br> we'll all starve!<br> The wheats' gone! And the rice!<br> The more my fields<br> I have only this handful of beans!<br> Mother! Mother!<br> You know we're not thieves!<br> But the ox is mine!<br> We're hungry! Our children are hungry!<br> You should help us!<br> If I have money I would help you!<br> My nephew! You can sell your land!<br> Sell my land?<br> Yes!<br> But then the money is gone,<br> and the land!<br> At least we could<br> live well through the famine!<br> What good is this land now?<br> You're young,<br> you don't know what a famine is like!<br> My father knew years of famine,<br> but he kept the land<br> I must keep it for my sons!<br> The earth is good,<br> if we work it would feed us<br> But how am I to live?<br> How am I to live?<br> Work! As I do!<br> I'll not rob my sons to feed you!<br> You you! Must we go hungry<br> while you have land?<br> This land that you won't sell!<br> I'm not selling my land<br> It's my life, it's mine!<br> I'll never sell it,<br> I'll dig up the earth<br> first and feed it to my children<br> Yes! And you'll bury them in it!<br> He's my friend, my friend<br> We're not hungry!<br> Mercy on me you powerful ones!<br> I starve and my woman starve,<br> and there's no one<br> to give me a handful of rice!<br> There's one who has plenty,<br> but he's a rich man!<br> And rich's hardened the heart,<br> soften his heart<br> o powerful ones,<br> that he may give me a little<br> out of his abundance!<br> Would not a man sell his lands<br> unless he has foods<br> to give his children?<br> He has food! And I starve!<br> He has food! And these good men starve!<br> Well, what?<br> You have food! We're starving!<br> You have food! Food!<br> I have nothing!<br> I dig for roots, for my children<br> You have food hidden! Food and silver!<br> Food?

We can fight it!<br> Have you ever seen a plague of locusts?<br> No but...<br> I have! They came in millions<br> The air is black with them and stinky<br> And where they come down<br> there's nothing left!<br> Not a green of wheat!<br> Not a blade of grass!<br> Not a leave nor flower! Nothing!<br> And can you fight that with your book?<br> Forgive me!<br> I mean no disrespect for my elders,<br> but I speak for what I heard at school!<br> And I heard this:<br> "That a man is a slave to the earth,<br> or its master<br> and when it turns against him,<br> he must fight it!"<br> We can fight these creeping things!<br> If we save but 1 field,<br> it would a new thing in all this land,<br> and the best in a thousand years!<br> This thing can be done?<br> Show us how to do it!<br> If it'd please you,<br> come on to the fields!<br> Now look!<br> The locusts will come down here,<br> the wind blows between these hills<br> There! Like a whirlpool,<br> if it blows the locusts<br> they'll come down there<br> and no other place!<br> I saw it! As a boy!<br> They came down there!<br> And they were gone,<br> with a change of wind<br> But the crops, were gone with them!<br> But that's the thing!<br> We can hold them off<br> till the wind changes!<br> We must take a fire break<br> along these hill tops<br> Make a wall of fire!<br> But my wheat<br> lights on fire in a fire wall!<br> And mine! And mine! And mine!<br> I'll pay for<br> what is eaten and what is burnt!<br> We'll get kerosene,<br> bring it in carts!<br> The fire stuff,<br> it makes a quick, high flame<br> We can fight everything<br> behind this wall!<br> If they break through,<br> we'll wind the ditch behind the fire;<br> a wall of water!<br> It will fail!<br> If it fails,<br> we'll fight them with torches!<br> With noise! With our hands!<br> If we can hold them off until<br> the wind picks them up again,<br> we can save at least those fields!<br> It can't be done!<br> It must be done!<br> All you have<br> and all I have depends on it!<br> You think I'm rich?<br> But if I lose<br> this harvest there's nothing!<br> If I save anything I'll share it!<br> Yeah yeah yeah!<br> Let the men dig and women,<br> let the old men and boys make torches,<br> gather all things that'll make a noise!<br> Bring the fire stuff!<br> Get the oxens and ploughs,<br> sickels, spades!<br> Everyone!
