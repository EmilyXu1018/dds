But I just -<br> Look - what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?<br> What if he did?<br> Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?<br> Don't you think he trusts us together?<br> Of course he does,<br> But he might get the wrong idea.<br> Anyone might.<br> I don't see why.<br> I'm twice as old as you are.<br> How could anyone think......<br> But they would! Don't you see?<br> Benjamin - I'm not trying to seduce you.<br> I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson,<br> This is difficult for me.<br> Would you like me to seduce you?<br> What?<br> Is that what you're trying to tell me?<br> I'm going home now.<br> I apologize for what I said.<br> I hope you can forget it.<br> But I'm going home right now.<br> Benjamin?<br> Yes.<br> Will you bring up my purse before you go?<br> I have to go now. I'm sorry.<br> I really don't want to put this on again.<br> Won't you bring it up?<br> Where is it?<br> On the table in the hall.<br> Mrs. Robinson?<br> I'm in the bathroom.<br> Well here's the purse.<br> Could you bring it up?<br> Well I'll hand it to you. Come to<br> the railing and I'll hand it up.<br> Benjamin - I am getting pretty<br> tired of all this suspicion.<br> Now if you won't do me a simple favor,<br> I don't know what.<br> I'm putting it on the top step.<br> For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop<br> acting that way and bring me the purse?<br> I'm putting it here by the door.<br> Will you bring it in to me?<br> I'd rather not.<br> All right. Put it in Elaine's room where we were.<br> Right.<br> Oh, God!<br> Let me out!<br> Don't be nervous.<br> Get away from that door.<br> Let me say something first.<br> Dear God!<br> Benjamin, I want you to know<br> I'm available to you.<br> If you wont sleep with me this time.<br> Oh my God!<br> If you wont sleep with me this time<br> I want you to know you can call me up any time<br> you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.<br> Do you understand what I said?<br> Let me out!<br> Benjamin, Do you understand what I said?<br> Yes. Yes. Let me out!<br> Because I find you very attractive<br> and any time you want-<br> Oh, Jesus that's him!<br> Is that Ben's car in front?<br> Yes, Sir!<br> I drove uh... I drove Mrs. Robinson home.<br> She wanted me to drive her home so I...<br> I drove her home.<br> Swell. I appreciate it.<br> She's upstairs. She wanted me to<br> wait down here till you got home.<br> Standing guard over the old castle, are you?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Hey, congratulations!<br> Thank you!<br> It looks like you need a refill.<br> Oh no. I got to go.<br> Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.<br> No. No - I'm just - I'm just a little worried about<br> my future. I'm a little upset about my future.<br> Come on. Let's have a nightcap together.<br> Scotch?<br> Bourbon.<br> Ben - how old are you now?<br> That's a hell of a good age to be.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben -<br> Sir?<br> You'll never be young again.<br> I know.<br> Ben, can I say something to you?<br> What?<br> How long have we known each other now?<br> How long have you and I known each other?<br> How long have your Dad and I been partners?<br> Quite a while.<br> I've watched you grow up, Ben.<br> Yes, sir.<br> In many ways I feel as though<br> you were my own son.<br> Thank you.<br> So I hope you won't mind my giving<br> you a friendly piece of advice.<br> I'd like to hear it.<br> Ben - I think - I think you ought to be taking it<br> a little easier right now than you seem to be.<br> Sow a few wild oats. Take things as they come.<br> Have a good time with the girls and so forth.<br> Don't get up.<br> I was just telling... -Ben... -Ben here he ought to sow<br> a few wild oats. Have a good time while<br> he can. You think that's sound advice?<br> Yes, I do.<br> I've got to go.<br> You have yourself a few fillings this summer.<br> I bet you're quite a ladies' man.<br> Oh no.<br> What? You look to me like the kind of guy that<br> has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you<br> like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?<br> Yes, he does.<br> Oh say - Elaine gets down<br> from Berkeley on Saturday.<br> Oh yes.<br> I wish you give her a call.<br> I will.<br> Benjamin? Benjamin?<br> Yes.<br> Thank you for taking me home.<br> I'll see you soon, I hope.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please<br> for this afternoon's feature attraction.<br> Hey, over there!

Well, I will then.<br> If you'll excuse me.<br> Yes sir?<br> A room. I'd like a room, please.<br> Single room or double room?<br> A single. Just for myself, please.<br> Will you sign the register, please?<br> Is anything wrong, sir?<br> What? No, Nothing.<br> Do you have any luggage, Mister... Gladstone?<br> Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.<br> Where is it?<br> What?<br> Where is your luggage?<br> Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.<br> Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.<br> -Oh no. I mean I'd rather not go<br> to the trouble of bringing it all in.<br> I just have a toothbrush.<br> I can get it myself. If that's all right.<br> Of course.<br> I'll have a porter show you the room.<br> Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself.<br> I just have the toothbrush to carry up<br> and I think I can handle it myself.<br> Whatever you say, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> Mrs. Robinson.<br> Yes?<br> For you.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello?<br> Mrs. Robinson?<br> Yes?<br> It's Benjamin.<br> Yes?<br> Benjamin Braddock.<br> Benjamin, where are you?<br> Can you look through the glass.<br> Can you see me now?<br> Yes, I can.<br> I got a single room.<br> That's fine.<br> But there's one thing. The desk clerk<br> seemed to be a little bit suspicious.<br> I don't know what their policy is.<br> Well - do you want to go up first?<br> Yes - I think that would be good.<br> I'll be up in five minutes.<br> Well - goodbye then -<br> Benjamin.<br> Yes?<br> Isn't there something<br> you want to tell me?<br> To tell you?<br> Yes.<br> Well, I want you to know how<br> much I appreciate this, really.<br> The number.<br> What?<br> The room number, Benjamin.<br> I think you ought to tell me that.<br> Oh? You're absolutely right.<br> It's 568.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome. Well - I'll see<br> you later, Mrs. Robinson.<br> Check, please.<br> I've got it.<br> I say I've got it.<br> Sir?<br> The toothbrush. I got it all right.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Yes. Well - goodnight.<br> Goodnight, sir.<br> Hello, Benjamin.<br> Hello, Mrs Robinson.<br> Benjamin.<br> Yes?<br> I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?<br> Sure.<br> Shall I - I mean shall I just stand here?<br> I mean - I don't know what you want me to do.<br> Why don't you watch?<br> Oh, sure. Thank you.<br> Will you bring me a hanger?<br> What?<br> A hanger.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Wood?<br> What?<br> Wood or wire? They have both.<br> Either one will be fine.<br> Okay.<br> Thank you!<br> Will you help me with this, please?<br> Certainly.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> Benjamin, Would this be<br> easier for you in the dark?<br> Mrs. Robinson - I can't do this.<br> You what?<br> This is all terribly wrong.<br> Do you find me undesirable?<br> Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.<br> I think - I think you're the most<br> attractive of all my parents' friends.<br> I mean that. I found you desirable, but I-<br> For god's sake, can you<br> imagine my parents?<br> Can you imange what they will say if<br> they just saw we are in this room like now?<br> What will they say?<br> I have no idea, Mrs. Robinson.<br> But for God's sake.<br> They brought me up, they<br> made a good life for me.<br> And I think they deserve better than this.<br> I think they deserve a little better than<br> jumping into bed with their partner's wife.<br> Are you afraid of me?<br> Oh, no, you are missing the point.<br> Look, maybe we could do something else together.<br> Mrs. Robinson, would you like to go to a movie?<br> Can I ask you a personal question?<br> I should do anything you want.<br> Is this your first time?<br> Is this what?<br> It is, isn't it?<br> It is your first time.<br> That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.<br> That's really a laugh. Ha ha.<br> You can admit that, can't you?<br> Are you kidding?<br> It's nothing to be ashamed of -<br> Wait a minute!<br> On your first time -<br> Who said it was my first time.<br> that you're afraid -<br> Wait a minute.<br> - of bring - inadequate - I mean just because<br> you happen to be inadequate in one way -<br> INADEQUATE?<br> Don't move.<br> Ben - what are you doing?<br> Well - I would say that I'm just<br> drifting. - here - in the pool.<br> Why?<br> Well - it's very comfortable -<br> just to drift here.<br> Have you thought about graduate school?<br> No.<br> Would you mind telling me then -<br> what were those four years of<br> college for? What was the point<br> of all that hard work?<br> You got me.<br> Now listen, Ben.<br> I think it's a very good thing that a young<br> man - after he's done some very good work -<br> should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself,<br> and lie around, and drink beer and so on.<br> But after a few weeks<br> I believe that person would want to take<br> some stock in himself and his situation<br> and start to think about<br> getting off his ass.<br> The Robinson's are here.<br> Hi, Ben. What are you doing<br> with yourself these days?<br> Oh, not too much. Taking it easy.<br> That's what I'd do if I could.<br> Nothing wrong with that.<br> Hey, Ben, Elaine's coming<br> down from Berkeley soon.<br> I want you to call her up this time.<br> I will.<br> Because I just think you two would<br> hit it off real well together.<br> Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.<br> Hello, Mrs. Robinson.<br> Hello, Benjamin.<br> Can I talk to you for a minute?<br> Sure.<br> Benjamin, Darling.<br> I'm going to ask you something<br> but you don't have to tell me<br> if you don't want to.<br> What?<br> Well I'm going to ask you what<br> you do when you go off at night.<br> When I go off?<br> You don't have to tell me if<br> you don't want to.<br> No, I do. I want to tell you.<br> I drive around.<br> What else?<br> Nothing else.<br> Well you don't drive around from midnight<br> until noon the next day, Benjamin.<br> Oh, no.<br> Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?<br> Meet someone?<br> Why did you say that?<br> Well this is your business,<br> I won't play games.<br> No wait. Wait, I don't meet anyone,<br> Mother. But why did you say that?<br> Benjamin, I don't want to pry<br> into your affairs,<br> but I'd rather you didn't say<br> anything at all than be dishonest.<br> Goodnight.<br> Well, wait.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Will you wait a minute, please?<br> Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say<br> a few words to each other first this time?<br> I don't think we have much<br> to say to each other.<br> Look, for a month, all we ever do is to<br> come up here and leap into bed together.<br> Are you tired of it?<br> I'm not. No. But do you think<br> we could liven it up with a little<br> conversation for change?<br> Well what do you want to talk about?<br> Anything. Anything at all.<br> Do you want to tell me about<br> some of your college experiences?<br> Oh my God.<br> Think of another topic.<br> How about art.<br> Art. That's a good subject.<br> You start it off.<br> You start it off. I don't know<br> anything about it.<br> What do you want<br> to know about it.<br> Are you interested more in modern<br> art or more in classical art.<br> Neither.<br> You're not interested in art?<br> No.<br> Then why do you want to talk about it?<br> I don't.<br> Now look, we are going to do this thing.<br> we are going to have a conversation.<br> Tell me what you did today.<br> I got up.<br> I fixed breakfast for my husband.<br> There!<br> There's something we could have<br> a conversation about Your husband!<br> Oh...Him.<br> I mean everything. I don't know<br> anything about how you work this.<br> What do you say to him when<br> you leave the house at night?<br> Nothing. He's asleep.<br> Always? Doesn't he wake up<br> when you come home?<br> We have seperated bedrooms.<br> Oh I see... So you don't - I mean<br> I don't like to seem like I'm prying<br> but I guess you don't sleep<br> together or anything.<br> No we don't.<br> Well how long has<br> this been going on.<br> Forgot it.<br> Wait a minute, Why do you marry?<br> See if you can guess.<br> Well I can't.<br> Think real hard, Benjamin.<br> I can't see why you did, unless<br> You didn't have to marry<br> him or anything, did you?<br> Don't tell Elaine.<br> Oh no. You had to marry him<br> because you got pregnant?<br> Are you shocked?<br> Well I never thought of you and Mr.<br> Robinson as the kind of people who...<br> Oh, I know. Let's get to bed.<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> So how did it happen?<br> What?<br> Mrs. Robinson, I mean do you feel like telling me<br> what were the circumstances?<br> Not particularly.<br> Was he a law student at the time?<br> And you were a student also.<br> At college.<br> Yes.<br> What was your major?<br> Benjamin, why are you asking<br> me all these questions?<br> Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.<br> Now what was your<br> major subject at college?<br> Art.<br> Art?<br> But I thought you...<br> I guess you kind of lost interest<br> in it over the years then.<br> Kind of.<br> Well how did it happen?<br> What?<br> You and Mr. Robinson.<br> How do you think.<br> I mean did he take you<br> up to his room with him?<br> Did you go to a hotel?<br> Benjamin, what does<br> it possibly matter?<br> I'm curious.<br> We'd go to his car.<br> Oh no. In the car you did it?<br> I don't think we were the first.<br> What kind of car was it?<br> What?<br> Do you remember the<br> make of the car?<br> Oh my God.<br> Really. I want to know.<br> It was a Ford, Benjamin.<br> A Ford! A Ford! God damn it,<br> That's great! a Ford!<br> That's enough.<br> So old Elaine Robinson<br> got started in a Ford.<br> Don't talk about Elaine.<br> Don't talk about Elaine?<br> No.<br> Why not?<br> Because I don't want you to.<br> Why don't you?<br> I wish you'd tell me.<br> There's nothing to tell.<br> Well why is she a big taboo<br> subject all of a sudden?<br> Well - I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date<br> and find out what the big deal is...<br> Benjamin, don't you ever take that<br> girl out. Do you understand that?<br> Well look. I have no<br> intention of taking her out.<br> Good.<br> I was just kidding around.<br> -Good.<br> But why shouldn't I?<br> I have my reasons.<br> Then let's hear them.<br> No.<br> Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson.<br> Because I think I know what they are.<br> I'm not good enough for her<br> to associate with, am I?<br> I'm not good enough to<br> even talk about her, am I?<br> Let's drop it.<br> We're not dropping it.<br> I'm good enough for you but I'm not good<br> enough to associate with your daughter.<br> That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?<br> Yes<br> You go to hell. You go straight<br> to hell, Mrs. Robinson.<br> Do you think I'm proud of myself?<br> Do you think I'm proud of this?<br> I wouldn't know.<br> Well, I am not.<br> No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time<br> with a brokendown alcoholic!<br> I see.<br> And if you think I come here for<br> any reason besides pure boredom,<br> then you're all wrong.<br> Because, Mrs. Robinson, this is the sickest,<br> most perverted thing that ever happened to me.<br> And you do what you want<br> but I'm getting the hell out.<br> Are you?<br> You're goddamn right I am.<br> That's how you feel about me.<br> That I'm a sick and disgusting person.<br> I won't start this.<br> What?<br> Don't start acting hurt.<br> Don't you expect me<br> to be a little hurt?<br> Mrs. Robinson, you lie here and tell me<br> I'm not good enough for your daughter.<br> Did I say that?<br> In so many words.<br> Benjamin, I want to apologize to you<br> if that's the impression you got.<br> Well two minutes ago you told me<br> I wasn't good enough for your daughter.<br> Now you say you're sorry<br> I got that impression.<br> I didn't mean it. I don't think<br> you'd be right for each other.<br> But I would never say you weren't<br> as good a person as she is.<br> You wouldn't.<br> Of course I wouldn't.<br> What are you doing?<br> Well it's pretty obvious you<br> don't want me around any more.<br> Well look -<br> I was kind of upset there.<br> I'm sorry I said those things.<br> That's all right. I think I can<br> understand why I'm disgusting to you.<br> Oh no. Look, I like you.<br> I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.<br> But if it's sickening for you -<br> It's not.<br> I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the<br> one thing I have to look forward to.<br> You don't have to say that.<br> Well I wouldn't. I would<br> never say it if it wasn't true.<br> May I stay then?<br> Yes. Please. I want you to.<br> Thank you.<br> Well don't thank me,<br> because I want you to.<br> But you won't ever take out Elaine, will you?<br> I want you to promise me that.<br> Look. Why the hell did you bring this up.<br> It never occured to me to take her out.<br> Then give me your word you won't.<br> This is absurd.<br> Promise me, Benjamin.<br> All right, I promise, for Christ's sake.<br> I promise I will never take<br> out Elaine Robinson.<br> Thank you.<br> Benjanmin.<br> Let's not talk about it.<br> Let's not talk at all.<br> Elaine's back from school.<br> I think it might be a nice gesture<br> if you asked her out.<br> Suppose she's not good<br> enough for you, is that it?<br> Look - Elaine Robinson and I<br> do not get along.<br> How do you know?<br> You haven't seen her since high school.<br> Suppose<br> your evenings, whatever<br> you do with them, are just too valuable.<br> That has nothing to do with it -<br> I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson<br> that you're just too busy every<br> evening - doing God knows what -<br> Don't go on like this.<br> If Benjamin absolutely<br> refuses to take her out -<br> I do.<br> - then I'll simply have to invite all the<br> Robinsons over on Thursday.<br> Well, Braddock - it's about<br> time you got around to this.<br> Hello.<br> Come on in. I'm afraid the young<br> lady isn't quite ready yet.<br> What would you say to a short one?<br> Scotch still your drink?<br> Bourbon.<br> I'll see if she's ready.<br> Now listen, this was not my<br> idea. It was my father's idea.<br> Benjamin, I thought I made myself<br> perfectly clear about this.<br> Look, we'll go out to dinner and<br> have a drink and I'll bring her right back.<br> Because it was either that or a<br> dinner party for the two families.<br> And I'm afriad I couldn't quite<br> handle that, if you don't mind.<br> Look, I have no intention of ever taking<br> your precious daughter out again in her life.<br> So don't get upset about it.<br> But I am. I'm extremely<br> upset about it, Benjamin.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Well, I want you to keep your wits about you tonight.<br> You never know what tricks Ben<br> picked up back there in the East.<br> You're living at home now. Is that right?<br> Yes.<br> Do you know what you're going to do?<br> No.<br> Are you going to graduate school?<br> No.<br> Do you always drive like this?<br> Yes.<br> Sit down.<br> Why don't you watch the show?<br> Benjamin, do you dislike<br> me for some reason?<br> No - why should I?<br> I don't know.<br> You're missing a great effect here.<br> How do you like that?<br> Could you do it?<br> Stop.Hey!!!<br> Elaine, I'm sorry.<br> Will you take me home now?<br> I'm sorry I took you in there.<br> I think I'd better go<br> home now, please.<br> Where is the car?<br> I just want to tell you something.<br> I want to go home.<br> But could I just tell you this one thing?<br> What?<br> This whole idea, this date and everything.<br> It was my parents' idea.<br> They forced me into it.<br> Oh - that's very nice of<br> you to tell me.<br> No. What I mean is - that's<br> why I've been acting this way.<br> I'm not like this.<br> I hate myself like this.<br> Listen, could you just stop crying, please?<br> No, I couldn't.<br> But could you try?<br> No.<br> I've had this feeling ever<br> since I've graduated.<br> This kind of compulsion that<br> I have to be rude all the time.<br> Do you know what I mean?<br> Yes, I do.<br> It's like I've been playing<br> some kind of - game -<br> but the rudes<br> don't make any sense to me.<br> They're being made up<br> by all the wrong people.<br> No, I mean no one makes them up,<br> they seem to have made themselves up.<br> Hey - I wonder if I could request<br> you to turn that down a little?<br> Would you like to come in?<br> I could make some coffee.<br> No, I mean - I wouldn't<br> want to wake anyone up.<br> We won't. Let's go inside.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Is anything wrong?<br> No, I was just thinking.<br> It's still early.<br> We could do something,<br> go somewhere else.<br> All right.<br> Where we going?<br> I'm trying to think of where there's a place<br> to have a drink around here.<br> Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?<br> What is the matter?<br> Nothing. I'm just wondering<br> if they have a bar or not.<br> I mean let's go see. Let's<br> go see if they do or not.<br> Listen, Elaine, it seems to me<br> that there isn't a bar here.<br> I mean - as far as I know.<br> Of course there is. Look, the<br> Veranda Room, right there.<br> Good evening.<br> Hello, how are you, sir?<br> Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.<br> Hello again.<br> Hi, Mr. Gladstone.<br> How are you this evening?<br> Benjamin -<br> Let's get out of here, Elaine.<br> Let's go somewhere else.<br> Do they know you?<br> Of course not.<br> Good evening, sir.<br> Come on, Elaine. We're leaving.<br> Mr. Gladstone - how are you?<br> Benjamin, what's happening?<br> I don't know. They must think<br> I look like this guy Gladstone.<br> Hello, Mr. Brannif.<br> Elaine, I like you.<br> I like you so much.<br> Do you believe that?<br> Do you?<br> Yes.<br> You're the first - you're the first<br> thing for so long that I've liked.<br> The first person<br> I could stand to be with.<br> My whole life is such a waste.<br> It's just nothing.<br> I'm sorry. I'll take you home now.<br> Benjamin - are you having<br> an affair with someone?<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> That is not my business.<br> It just happened.<br> It was just this thing that happened<br> along with everything else.<br> Can you understand that?<br> Was she married or something?<br> Yes.<br> With a family?<br> Yes. She had a husband and a son.<br> Did they ever find out?<br> No.<br> And it's all over now.<br> Yes.<br> I'm glad.<br> Can we do something tomorrow?<br> All right.<br> During the day? We'll go<br> for a drive or something.<br> Okay.<br> You sure you really want to?<br> Yes.<br> Because I wouldn't want you to<br> do it unless you really wanted to!<br> I do.<br> You do?<br> Drive down the block.<br> Mrs. Robinson, Elaine I have<br> a date. We're going for a drive.<br> Do exactly as I say.<br> Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin<br> You are not to see Elaine again, ever.<br> Those are my orders. Is that clear?<br> Mrs. Robinson, do you think -<br> I can makes things quite unpleasant.<br> How?<br> In order to keep Elaine away from you,<br> I am prepared to tell her everything.<br> I don't believe you.<br> Then you'd better start believing me.<br> I just don't believe you would do that.<br> Try me.<br> Elaine! Elaine!<br> Benjamin?<br> Benjamin?<br> I'm coming up.<br> I'm not dressed yet.<br> Benjamin - I said I wasn't dressed.<br> You've got to go over the back fence<br> and I'll meet you on the corner.<br> Benjamin, what's the matter?<br> Hurry up. Put your shoes on.<br> Benjamin, Benjamin.<br> Elaine.<br> What are you doing?<br> Elaine, I have to tell you something.<br> What is it?<br> That woman.<br> What?<br> The older woman we talked about.<br> You mean the one who -<br> Yes, the married woman.<br> It wasn't just some woman -<br> What are you telling me?<br> Benjamin, will you just tell<br> me what it is all about?<br> Oh, no.<br> Elaine -<br> Oh my God!<br> Please!<br> Get out of here!<br> Don't cry -<br> GET OUT!<br> GET OUT!<br> Goodbye, Benjamin.<br> Say that again.<br> I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.<br> Ha...Ha... Well - Well - Well<br> What's happening?<br> Ben says he and Elaine<br> are getting married.<br> I don't believe it.<br> That's what he says. Right?<br> I'm going up to Berkeley today.<br> Come on, let's call the Robinsons.<br> We've got something to celebrate.<br> No, I think you'll want<br> to wait on that.<br> They don't know?<br> No - they don't.<br> Well, when did you decide all this?<br> About an hour ago.<br> Wait a minute. You talked<br> to Elaine this morning?<br> No, she doesn't know about it.<br> You mean she doesn't know<br> that you're coming up to Berkeley?<br> No. Actually, she doesn't know<br> about us getting married yet.<br> When did you two talk this over?<br> We haven't.<br> You haven't?<br> Ben, this whole idea<br> sounds pretty half-baked.<br> No, it's not. It's completely baked.<br> It's a decision I've made.<br> But what makes you think<br> she wants to marry you?<br> She doesn't. To be perfectly<br> honest, she doesn't like me.<br> You're a student?<br> Not exactly.<br> What's not exactly?<br> - I said not exactly, no.<br> What are you then?<br> Well, I'm just sort of traveling through.<br> I like to know who's living in my house,<br> like to know what my boys are up to.<br> I'm not up too much.<br> I'm just visiting.<br> I mean - I've always wanted to see Berkeley.<br> You're not one of those agitators?<br> What?<br> One of those outside agitators.<br> Oh - no.<br> I hate that.<br> I won't stand for it.<br> Well, how about this for a coincidence.<br> I was wondering where<br> you were headed.<br> I'm meeting someone.<br> Ah. Where?<br> Where are you meeting this person?<br> At the zoo.<br> The Zoo. They have a pretty<br> good one here, do they?<br> I don't know, I've never seen it.<br> Oh. Well, I haven't either.<br> I might just ride out there with you.<br> Is that him over there?<br> No.<br> Where did he say he was going to meet you?<br> I thought he said by the monkey house.<br> Benjamin - I would like to know<br> what you're doing here.<br> Here? In Berkelely?<br> Yes.<br> Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter<br> Street, and I've been getting to some classes.<br> But you're not enrolled.<br> No, I just sit in.<br> They don't seem to mind.<br> They've been very congenial about it.<br> Benjamin - you're -<br> I don't know what to say.<br> Maybe we could get together<br> some time and talk about it.<br> Really incredible.<br> Here he comes.<br> What?<br> I've got a real feeling<br> that this is the fellow.<br> Elaine!<br> He certainly is a good walker.<br> Am I late? I'm sorry.<br> We thought you said by<br> the monkey house.<br> This is Benjamin Braddock.<br> Carl Smith.<br> Benjamin rode here with me on the bus.<br> Glad to meet you, Ben.<br> Great meeting you, Carl.<br> Swell seeing you.<br> Who is this?<br> I want to ask you a question. and I'm going.<br> Come in.<br> No. I want to know why<br> you're here in Berkeley?<br> Because - I am.<br> Is it because I'm here?<br> What do you think?<br> I think it is.<br> I said I think it is.<br> All right then! Yes!<br> Well, I want you to leave.<br> Oh, look, I love you!<br> How could you do that, Benjamin?<br> Do you just hate everything?<br> How could you possibly rape my mother?<br> What?<br> I don't understand -<br> I don't understand how you - how<br> anyone - could do a thing like that.<br> What did she say?<br> You got tell me what did she say.<br> Why?<br> Because it isn't true.<br> Tell me.<br> She said she was having a drink<br> in the hotel with a friend.<br> You waited for her in the parking lot and told<br> her she was too drunk to drive home<br> and you would get her a room for the night.<br> Then what?<br> Then you took her upstairs<br> and raped her.<br> Oh, no, no, no, that's not what happened.<br> What happened was there<br> was this party at my parents.<br> I drove your mother home -<br> I don't want to hear it.<br> then we went upstairs<br> to see your portrait.<br> No - I no -<br> and when we got up in the room -<br> This is my mother!<br> - she starts taking her her clothes off<br> suddenly there she was without any<br> clothes on. I mean really naked.<br> Oh, hello, Mr. McCleery.<br> Who screamed?<br> It's all right, Mr. McCleery.<br> Screaming isn't all right.<br> Not in my house, it isn't.<br> It was just a visitor.<br> But it's all right now.<br> What did you do to her?<br> Look, she's all right. She's upset and<br> she screamed. But she's okay now.<br> Shall I get the cops?<br> What?<br> I'll get the cops.<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> Damned look, see, here<br> she's having some water.<br> Now there's no need<br> for the cops or anything.<br> All right, boys, I think you can<br> get back to your rooms now.<br> I don't think we'll have<br> any more of this agitation.<br> Will we, Braddock?<br> No, sir.<br> I want you out of here.<br> What do you mean?<br> You heard me. Out of here.<br> What for?<br> Because I don't like you.<br> I'm sorry I screamed.<br> Benjamin, when you came up here,<br> what did you think was going<br> to happen between us?<br> Elaine - right now I don't<br> feel like talking much.<br> I'm sorry about everything.<br> but I think I'll just do this now.<br> Can I just sit here while you're packing?<br> If you want.<br> What are you going to do now?<br> I don't know.<br> Are you going home?<br> No.<br> Well, where are you going?<br> Elaine, you're going to stop asking me.<br> I don't want you to leave tomorrow.<br> I don't understand.<br> I don't want you to go anywhere.<br> until you have a definite plan.<br> Goodbye.<br> What's happening?<br> Benjamin?<br> What?<br> Will you kiss me?<br> Will you marry me?<br> You won't?<br> I don't know.<br> But you might.<br> I might.<br> Is that so? You might marry me?<br> Yes.<br> When?<br> I don't know.<br> How about tomorrow?<br> I don't mean to be pushy but -<br> I don't know. I don't<br> know what's happening.<br> You mean you're confused?<br> Well, look, don't be confused.<br> We're getting married.<br> I don't see how we can.<br> We just can.<br> I have to go now.<br> Elaine, are you serious about this?<br> I'll think about it.<br> You really will?<br> Yes.<br> We can go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow?<br> Or this afternoon.<br> It's a good day for it.<br> Benjamin, I haven't even<br> said I'll marry you yet.<br> We'll need our Birth Certificates.<br> I happen to have mine<br> with me. Where's yours?<br> I just don't think it would work.<br> Why wouldn't it?<br> Why wouldn't it?<br> I just don't think it would...<br> Tomorrow then - can we get our<br> blood tests tomorrow morning?<br> Why don't you just drag me off<br> if you want to marry me so much?<br> Why don't I just drag you off?<br> All right, I will.<br> Right after we get the blood tests.<br> I have to see Carl first.<br> Carl who?<br> Carl who?<br> Carl Smith. He's a medical student.<br> We've known him for years.<br> Who, that guy at the Zoo?<br> Yes.<br> Why do you have to see him?<br> Well, I said I might marry him.<br> You WHAT?<br> How did he do it?<br> Did he get down on his knees?<br> He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.<br> No, Benjamin.<br> Well, what did he say? I'm curious.<br> He said he thought we'd<br> make a pretty good team.<br> Oh no. He said that.<br> Where did he do it?<br> I'd like to know where it happened?<br> It wasn't in his car, was it?<br> Good Night.<br> Are we getting married tomorrow?<br> No.<br> The day after tomorrow?<br> I don't know. Maybe we are<br> and maybe we're not.<br> Do you want, do you want to<br> try and tell me why you did it?<br> Mr. Robinson?<br> Do you have a special grudge against me?<br> Do you feel a particularly strong resentment?<br> No.<br> Is there something I've said<br> that's caused this contempt?<br> Or just the things I stand for that you despise?<br> It was nothing to do with you, sir.<br> Well, Ben, it was quite<br> a bit to do with me.<br> Now look, please!<br> Ben, I think we're two civilized people.<br> Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?<br> I'm not threatening you.<br> Do you want to unclench your fists, please.<br> Thank you.<br> I can see in the dark, you know.<br> I've been here quite a while.<br> I am trying to tell you I have no personal<br> feelings about you, Mr. Robinson.<br> I am trying to tell you<br> I do not resent you.<br> You don't respect me terribly<br> much either, do you?<br> No, Sir.<br> What?<br> No, Sir.<br> Don't shout at me, Ben. I may not be younger<br> than you, but I still have good hearing.<br> Mr. Robinson.<br> Have the decency to wait until I finish?<br> I do think you know the consequences<br> of what you've done.<br> I do think you should know that my<br> wife and I are getting a divorce soon.<br> But why?<br> -Why?!<br> Listen to me.<br> What happened between Mrs. Robinson<br> and me was nothing. It didn't mean anything.<br> We might just as well have been shaking hands.<br> Shaking hands. Well, that's not<br> saying much for my wife, is it?<br> You miss the point.<br> -I guess I do.<br> The point is I don't love your wife.<br> I love your daughter, sir.<br> All right, now listen this.<br> I don't know what I can possibly do.<br> But I think I can.<br> I think I can get you behind bars if<br> you ever look at my daughter again.<br> I have seen Elaine and I've made<br> damned sure you can get to her.<br> Stay away from me, Ben!<br> I don't want to mince words with you.<br> As far as Elaine's concerned, you're to<br> get her out of your filthy mind right now.<br> Is that perfectly clear to you?<br> And that's all, Ben.<br> You'll pardon me if I don't<br> shake hands with you.<br> I think you are filth.<br> I think you are scum.<br> You are a degenerate!<br> Mr. McCleery, do you have some change?<br> I need to use the phone.<br> I want you out of here.<br> Look, I'll give you ten dollars<br> for a dime. I'll give you twenty.<br> For God's sake, will you<br> let me use that phone?<br> I'll call the police, now.<br> Could I make one phone call first?<br> Get out here!<br> Elaine Robinson has left the school. Her<br> roommate is coming down with a note for you.<br> Dear Benjamin, please forgive me.<br> Because I know what I'm doing<br> is the best thing for you.<br> My father is so upset<br> you've got to understand.<br> I love you, but it would never work out.<br> Elaine.<br> Hello, Benjamin.<br> Where is she?<br> Hello. Get me the police, please.<br> Where is Elaine?<br> I'll be with you in a moment.<br> Do you have a petrol car in the<br> vicinity of 1200 Glenview Road.<br> Good, we have a burglar here.<br> Just a second. I'll ask him.<br> Are you armed?<br> No, I don't believe he is.<br> Thank you!<br> What have you done to her?<br> I think we have everything quite<br> under control now, Benjamin.<br> Would you like a quick drink before you go?<br> You can't stop me from seeing her,<br> Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.<br> I'm sorry we won't be able to invite<br> you to the wedding, Benjamin<br> but the arrangements have been so rushed.<br> What the hell have you done?<br> Ahh. I don't think you'll have<br> time for that drink after all.<br> I'll find her.<br> -I don't think so.<br> Say, fellows. Any of you fellows<br> know where Carl Smith is?<br> He took off in the middle of<br> the night to get married.<br> Proabaly one step ahead of the shotgun.<br> Would you happen to know where he's<br> getting married? I'm supposed to be there.<br> Why not just ask Carter?<br> Would you happen to know<br> where I might find him?<br> Hey, Carter, where's the Make<br> Out King getting married?<br> Santa Barbara.<br> You don't happen to know exactly where<br> the Make Out King is getting married, do you?<br> I'm supposed to be there.<br> Where in Santa Barbara?<br> I don't know. Maybe at his old man's house.<br> Or in the maternity ward!<br> Are you going to the wedding?<br> Yes.<br> Hey, tell him to save a piece for me.<br> of the wedding cake.<br> Can I use your phone?<br> Yes.<br> Hello - who is this?<br> This is Dr. Smith's answering service.<br> Is the doctor anywhere?<br> I'm afraid Doctor can't be reached right now.<br> If you like to...<br> I have to know where he is.<br> Well, you see, the doctor is at his son's<br> wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now.<br> He should be checking in any moment.<br> Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's<br> brother - Reverend Smith -<br> and I am supposed to perform the<br> ceremony. I just got in from Portland.<br> and I've forgotten what church, you see?<br> Oh. Well, I'm not sure, but you<br> might try the First Presbyterian.<br> That's on Allan Street.<br> Thank you!<br> Allan Street. Where is it?<br> Alan Street. It's, it's<br> You need any gas, Father?<br> Oh, Jesus - God - no -<br> Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!<br> Who is that guy?<br> What's he doing?<br> I'll take care of him.<br> He is too late.<br> Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!<br> Get up, we have to stop him!<br> Ben!<br> You punk, you crazy punk!<br> Elaine, it's too late.<br> Not for me!<br>
