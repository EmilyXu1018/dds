                        1<br> It is an extremely common mistake,<br> people think the writer's<br> imagination is always at work,<br> that he's constantly inventing<br> an endless supply<br> of incidents and episodes,<br> that he simply dreams up his<br> stories out of thin air.<br> In point of fact, the<br> opposite is true.<br> Once the public knows<br> you're a writer,<br> they bring the characters<br> and events to you<br> and as long as you maintain<br> your ability to look<br> and to carefully listen,<br> these stories will continue to...<br> Stop it. Stop it! Don't!<br> Don't do it!<br> Will continue to seek you<br> out over your lifetime.<br> To him who has often told<br> the tales of others,<br> many tales will be told.<br> - Sorry.<br> - It's all right.<br> The incidents that follow<br> were described to me<br> exactly as I present them here<br> and in a wholly unexpected way.<br> A number of years ago,<br> while suffering from a mild case<br> of "Scribe's Fever,"<br> a form of neurasthenia common among<br> the intelligentsia of that time,<br> I decided to spend<br> the month of August<br> in the spa town of Nebelsbad<br> below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz,<br> and had taken up rooms<br> in the Grand Budapest,<br> a picturesque, elaborate, and once<br> widely celebrated establishment.<br> I expect some of you will know it.<br> It was off season and, by that time,<br> decidedly out of fashion,<br> and it had already begun its descent<br> into shabbiness and<br> eventual demolition.<br> What few guests we were<br> had quickly come to recognize<br> one another by sight<br> as the only living souls residing<br> in the vast establishment,<br> although I do not believe any acquaintance<br> among our number had proceeded<br> beyond the polite nods<br> we exchanged as we passed<br> in the Palm Court,<br> in the Arabian baths,<br> and onboard the Colonnade Funicular.<br> We were a very reserved<br> group, it seemed,<br> and, without exception, solitary.<br> Perhaps as a result of<br> this general silence,<br> I had established a casual<br> and bantering familiarity<br> with the hotel's concierge,<br> a West-continental<br> known only as Monsieur Jean,<br> who struck one as being, at once, both<br> lazy and, really, quite accommodating.<br> I expect he was not well paid.<br> In any case, one evening,<br> as I stood conferring elbow-to-elbow<br> with Monsieur Jean,<br> as had become my habit, I noticed<br> a new presence in our company.<br> A small, elderly man,<br> smartly dressed,<br> with an exceptionally lively,<br> intelligent face<br> and an immediately perceptible<br> air of sadness.<br> He was, like the rest of us, alone,<br> but also, I must say,<br> he was the first that struck one<br> as being deeply and truly lonely.<br> A symptom<br> of my own medical condition as well.<br> Who's this interesting old fellow?<br> I inquired of Monsieur Jean.<br> To my surprise,<br> he was distinctly taken aback.<br> - Don't you know?<br> - He asked.<br> Don't you recognize him?<br> He did look familiar.<br> That's Mr. Moustafa himself.<br> He arrived earlier this morning.<br> This name will no doubt be familiar<br> to the more seasoned<br> persons among you.<br> Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time<br> the richest man in Zubrowka,<br> and was still indeed the owner<br> of the Grand Budapest.<br> He often comes and<br> stays a week or more,<br> three times a year at least,<br> but never in the season.<br> Monsieur Jean signaled to me<br> and I leaned closer.<br> I'll tell you a secret.<br> He takes only a single-bed<br> sleeping room without a bath<br> in the rear corner of the top floor<br> and it's smaller than<br> the service elevator!<br> It was well known,<br> Zero Moustafa had purchased<br> and famously inhabited<br> some of the most lavish castles<br> and palazzos on the continent.<br> Yet here, in his own<br> nearly empty hotel,<br> he occupied a servant's quarters?<br> At that moment, the curtain rose<br> on a parenthetical, domestic drama...<br> Shit.<br> which required the immediate<br> and complete attention<br> of Monsieur Jean,<br> but, frankly, did not<br> hold mine for long.<br> However,<br> this premature intermission<br> in the story of the curious, old man<br> had left me, as the expression goes,<br> "gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen,"<br> that is, on the edge of my seat,<br> where I remained throughout<br> the next morning, until,<br> in what I have found to be its<br> mysterious and utterly reliable fashion,<br> fate, once again,<br> intervened on my behalf.<br> I admire your work.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> I said, I know and admire<br> your wonderful work.<br> Thank you most kindly, sir.<br> Did Monsieur Jean have a word or two<br> to share with you<br> about the aged proprietor<br> of this establishment?<br> I must confess, I did<br> myself inquire about you.<br> He's perfectly capable,<br> of course, Monsieur Jean<br> but we can't claim he's a first,<br> or, in earnest, even<br> second-rate concierge.<br> But there it is.<br> Times have changed.<br> The thermal baths<br> are very beautiful.<br> They were in their first condition.<br> It couldn't be maintained, of course.<br> Too decadent for current tastes.<br> But I love it all just the same,<br> this enchanting old ruin.<br> How did you come to<br> buy it, if I may ask?<br> The Grand Budapest.<br> I didn't.<br> If you're not merely being polite,<br> and you must tell me<br> if that's the case,<br> but if it genuinely<br> does interest you,<br> may I invite you to<br> dine with me tonight,<br> and it will be my pleasure and,<br> indeed, my privilege to tell you<br> "my story." Such as it is.<br> Two ducks roasted with olives.<br> Rabbit, salad?<br> Pouilly-Jouvet '52, plus<br> a split of the brut.<br> That should provide us ample time<br> - if I commence promptly.<br> - By all means.<br> Well, it begins, as it must, with<br> our mutual friend's predecessor.<br> The beloved, original concierge<br> of The Grand Budapest.<br> It begins, of course, with...<br> - Bring the table to the window.<br> - Yes, Monsieur Gustave.<br> - Bring the tray to the table.<br> - Right away, Monsieur Gustave.<br> Right there.<br> Have those been brushed and blocked?<br> - Of course, Monsieur Gustave.<br> - Pack them in the hat boxes.<br> - Is that from Oberstdorf & Company?<br> - I believe so, Monsieur Gustave.<br> - Second trunk. Who has the tickets?<br> - I do, Monsieur Gustave.<br> Give them to me.<br> These are in order.<br> Wait in the corner.<br> - I'm not leaving.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - I'm not leaving.<br> - Why not?<br> - I'm frightened.<br> - Of what?<br> I fear this may be the last time<br> we ever see each other.<br> Why on earth would that be the case?<br> Well, I can't put it into<br> words, but I feel it.<br> For goodness sake, there's no reason<br> for you to leave us if you'd...<br> - Come with me.<br> - To fucking Lutz?<br> - Please.<br> - Give me your hand.<br> You've nothing to fear. You're always<br> anxious before you travel.<br> I admit, you appear to be suffering<br> a more acute attack on this occasion.<br> But, truly and honestly... Oh, dear God.<br> What have you done to your fingernails?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - This diabolical varnish.<br> - The color is completely wrong.<br> - Don't you like it?<br> It's not that I don't like it.<br> I am physically repulsed.<br> - Perhaps this will soothe you.<br> - What? Don't recite.<br> - Just listen to the words. Hush.<br> - Please. Not now.<br> "While questing once in noble wood<br> of gray, medieval pine,<br> "I came upon a tomb,<br> rain-slick'd, rubbed-cool, ethereal,<br> "'its inscription long-vanished,<br> "yet still within its<br> melancholy fissures..."<br> Will you light a<br> candle for me, please?<br> - In the sacristy of Santa Maria?<br> - I'll see to it myself immediately.<br> Remember, I'm always with you.<br> - I love you.<br> - I love you.<br> It's quite a thing winning<br> the loyalty of a woman like that<br> for 19 consecutive seasons.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - She's very fond of me, you know.<br> Yes, sir.<br> But I've never seen<br> her like that before.<br> No, sir.<br> She was shaking like a shitting dog.<br> Truly.<br> Run to the cathedral of Santa Maria<br> in Brucknerplatz.<br> Buy one of the plain,<br> half-length candles<br> and take back four<br> Klubecks in change.<br> Light it in the sacristy,<br> say a brief rosary<br> then go to Mendl's<br> and get me a courtesan au chocolat.<br> If there's any money left, give it<br> to the crippled shoe-shine boy.<br> - Right away, sir.<br> - Hold it.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy.<br> - Zero, you say?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I've never heard of you, never laid<br> eyes on you. Who hired you?<br> - Mr. Mosher, sir.<br> - Mr. Mosher!<br> Yes, Monsieur Gustave?<br> Am I to understand you've<br> surreptitiously hired this young man<br> in the position of a Lobby Boy?<br> He's been engaged for a trial period,<br> pending your approval, of course.<br> Perhaps, yes.<br> Thank you, Mr. Mosher.<br> You're most welcome,<br> Monsieur Gustave.<br> You're now going to be<br> officially interviewed.<br> Should I go and light<br> the candle first, sir?<br> What? No.<br> Experience?<br> Hotel Kinski, Kitchen<br> Boy, six months.<br> Hotel Berlitz, Mop and Broom Boy,<br> three months.<br> - Before that I was a Skillet Scrubber...<br> - Experience, zero.<br> - Thank you again, Monsieur Gustave.<br> - Straighten that cap, Anatole.<br> - The pleasure's mine, Herr Schneider.<br> - The strap's busted.<br> - These are not acceptable.<br> - I fully agree.<br> - Education?<br> - I studied reading and spelling.<br> I started my primary school.<br> I almost...<br> - Education, zero.<br> - Now it's exploded.<br> Good morning, Cicero.<br> Call the goddamn plumber!<br> - This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave?<br> - Without fail, Frau Liebling.<br> - What in hell is this?<br> - Not now.<br> Family?<br> Zero.<br> Six, Igor.<br> Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy?<br> Well, who wouldn't,<br> at the Grand Budapest, sir?<br> It's an institution.<br> Very good.<br> - A thousand Klubecks.<br> - My goodness.<br> Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir?<br> What do you think?<br> Well, I suppose you'd have<br> to start somewhere...<br> - Go and light the goddamn candle.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And so, my life began.<br> Junior Lobby Boy in-training,<br> Grand Budapest Hotel,<br> under the strict command<br> of Monsieur Gustave H.<br> I became his pupil, and he was<br> to be my counselor and guardian.<br> What is a Lobby Boy?<br> A Lobby Boy's completely<br> invisible, yet always in sight.<br> A Lobby Boy remembers<br> what people hate.<br> A Lobby Boy anticipates<br> the client's needs<br> before the needs are needed.<br> A Lobby Boy is, above all,<br> discreet to a fault.<br> Our guests know their<br> deepest secrets,<br> some of which are, frankly,<br> rather unseemly,<br> will go with us to our graves.<br> - So keep your mouth shut, Zero.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> That's all for now.<br> I began to realize that<br> many of the hotel's<br> most valued and distinguished guests<br> came for him.<br> It seemed to be an essential part<br> of his duties,<br> but I believe it was<br> also his pleasure.<br> The requirements were<br> always the same.<br> They had to be rich,<br> old,<br> insecure,<br> vain,<br> superficial,<br> blonde,<br> needy.<br> Why blonde?<br> Because they all were.<br> He was, by the way,<br> the most liberally perfumed man<br> I had ever encountered.<br> The scent announced his approach<br> from a great distance<br> and lingered for many minutes<br> after he was gone.<br> I worked six days each week<br> plus a half-day Sunday,<br> 5:00 AM until just after midnight.<br> Our meals were small but frequent,<br> for stamina.<br> Two breakfasts, two lunches<br> and a late supper.<br> Monsieur Gustave also delivered<br> a nightly sermon.<br> Rudeness is merely the<br> expression of fear.<br> People fear they won't<br> get what they want.<br> The most dreadful and unattractive<br> person only needs to be loved,<br> and they will open<br> up like a flower.<br> I am reminded of a verse,<br> "The painter's brush touched<br> the inchoate face<br> "by ends of nimble bristles<br> "and with their blush of first color,<br> rendered her lifeless cheek living."<br> His own dinner, he took<br> alone in his room.<br> The identity of the owner of the<br> hotel was unknown to all of us.<br> Each month, his emissary,<br> known as Deputy Kovacs, arrived<br> to review the books<br> and convey messages<br> on behalf of the<br> mysterious proprietor.<br> On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave<br> and our business manager,<br> Herr Becker, met with him in private<br> consultation above Reception.<br> This was also when I met Agatha,<br> but we won't discuss that.<br> - What do you want?<br> - Look.<br> Dear God.<br> I'm terribly sorry, sir.<br> - We must go to her.<br> - We must?<br> Tout de suite. She needs me, and I need<br> you to help me with my bags and so on.<br> - How fast can you pack?<br> - Five minutes.<br> Do it. And bring a bottle<br> of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26<br> in an ice bucket with two glasses<br> so we don't have to drink the cat<br> piss they serve in the dining car.<br> I blame myself.<br> She tried to tell me she had<br> a premonition. I didn't listen.<br> All of Lutz will be<br> dressed in black,<br> except her own ghastly,<br> deceitful children<br> whom she loathed<br> and couldn't bear to kiss hello.<br> They'll be dancing like gypsies.<br> There's really no point<br> in doing anything in life,<br> because it's all over in<br> the blink of an eye...<br> And, the next thing you know,<br> rigor mortis sets in.<br> Oh, how the good die young.<br> With any luck, she's left<br> a few Klubecks for your old friend,<br> but one never knows until the ink<br> is dry on the death certificate.<br> She was dynamite in<br> the sack, by the way.<br> She was 84, Monsieur Gustave.<br> I've had older.<br> When you're young,<br> it's all fillet steak,<br> but as the years go by, you have to<br> move on to the cheaper cuts,<br> which is fine with me,<br> because I like those.<br> More flavorful, or so they say.<br> Why are we stopping<br> at a barley field?<br> Well, hello there, chaps.<br> Documents, please.<br> With pleasure.<br> It's not a very flattering<br> portrait, I'm afraid.<br> I was once considered<br> a great beauty.<br> What does the "F" stand for?<br> Fritz? Franz?<br> - Franz.<br> - I knew it!<br> He's making a funny face.<br> That's a Migratory Visa with Stage<br> Three Worker Status, Franz, darling.<br> He's with me.<br> Come outside, please.<br> Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero.<br> His papers are in order.<br> I cross-referenced them myself with<br> the Bureau of Labor and Servitude.<br> You can't arrest him simply because<br> he's a bloody immigrant.<br> He hasn't done anything wrong.<br> Stop it, damn you!<br> Never mind, Monsieur Gustave!<br> Let them proceed!<br> Ow! That hurts!<br> You filthy, goddamn,<br> pock-marked, fascist assholes!<br> Take your hands off my Lobby Boy!<br> What's the problem?<br> This is outrageous.<br> The young man works for me at the<br> Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.<br> Monsieur Gustave?<br> My name is Henckels.<br> I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs. Wolfgang<br> Henckels-Bergersdofer.<br> Do you remember me?<br> I know exactly who you are.<br> It's uncanny. You're little Albert.<br> I'm terribly embarrassed.<br> Release them.<br> Release them.<br> Your colleague is stateless.<br> He'll need to apply for a<br> revised Special Transit Permit,<br> which at this point<br> may be very difficult to acquire.<br> Take this.<br> It's temporary but it's the<br> best I can offer, I'm afraid.<br> And how's your wonderful mother?<br> - She's very well, thank you.<br> - I adore her.<br> - Send my love.<br> - I will.<br> Your companion was very kind to me<br> when I was a lonely little boy.<br> My men and I apologize<br> for disturbing you.<br> I beg your pardon, sir.<br> You see? There are still<br> faint glimmers of civilization<br> left in this barbaric slaughterhouse<br> that was once known as humanity.<br> Indeed, that's what we provide in our<br> own modest, humble, insignificant...<br> Oh, fuck it.<br> Where is she, Clotilde?<br> Take me to her.<br> You're looking so well, darling.<br> You really are.<br> They've done a marvelous job.<br> I don't know what sort of cream they've<br> put on you down at the morgue,<br> but I want some.<br> Honestly, you look better<br> than you have in years.<br> You look like you're alive.<br> Oh, you changed it after all.<br> It's perfect.<br> - Clotilde?<br> - Oui, Monsieur Gustave?<br> A glass of chilled water<br> with no ice, please.<br> All right, then.<br> I shan't be long, darling.<br> We were escorted through<br> a green baize door,<br> down a narrow service corridor<br> and into the butler's pantry.<br> A moment later, the kitchen<br> passage swung open<br> and a small servant dressed in white<br> jolted into the room.<br> I've never forgotten<br> the look on that man's face.<br> What the devil is going on?<br> I, myself, had never set foot inside<br> a house of this kind in my life.<br> I understood very little about<br> the events that were to follow.<br> But, eventually,<br> I came to recognize,<br> when the destiny of a great fortune<br> is at stake,<br> men's greed spreads like a poison<br> in the bloodstream.<br> Uncles, nephews, cousins,<br> in-laws of increasingly<br> tenuous connection.<br> The old woman's most<br> distant relations<br> had come foraging out<br> of the woodwork.<br> At the head of this congregation,<br> it was a disorienting coincidence,<br> we discovered our own Deputy Kovacs,<br> himself an important<br> attorney, of course.<br> He was the executor<br> of the dead widow's estate.<br> This is Madame D's last<br> will and testament.<br> It consists of a general tontine<br> drawn up before the event of her<br> husband's death 46 years ago,<br> in combination with 635 amendments,<br> notations, corrections,<br> and letters of wishes<br> executed during the<br> subsequent decades.<br> The ultimate legality<br> of this accumulation<br> requires further analysis,<br> but in the opinion of this office,<br> it was Madame D's intention<br> that control of the<br> vast bulk of her estate<br> should be transferred, forthwith,<br> to her son, Dmitri,<br> with special allowances<br> for his sisters,<br> Marguerite, Laetizia, and Carolina,<br> and minor gifts for various members<br> of the extended family<br> as shown in the List of Recipients,<br> which I will elucidate in due course.<br> However.<br> An additional codicil,<br> delivered into my possession<br> by post only this morning,<br> and, by all indications,<br> sent by Madame D<br> during the last hours of her life,<br> contains an amendment<br> to the original certificate,<br> which, as prescribed by law,<br> I will read to you now.<br> The authenticity of this document<br> has not yet been confirmed<br> by the presiding magistrate,<br> so I ask that all parties be patient<br> and refrain from comment<br> until such time as our<br> investigations can be completed.<br> "To my esteemed friend<br> who comforted me in my later years<br> "and brought sunshine<br> into the life of an old woman<br> "who thought<br> that she would never be happy again.<br> "Monsieur Gustave H,<br> "I bequeath, bestow and devise,<br> free of all taxation<br> "and with full and absolute<br> fiduciary entitlement,<br> "the painting known as<br> 'Boy with Apple...'"<br> - Wow!<br> - "...by Johannes van Hoytl..."<br> - I can't believe it.<br> - "...the younger..."<br> - What?<br> - "which gave us both so much pleasure."<br> The van Hoytl?<br> - Tax-free?<br> - Can she do that?<br> Who's Gustave H?<br> I'm afraid that's me, darling.<br> That fucking faggot!<br> He's a concierge. What<br> are you doing here?<br> I've come to pay my respects<br> to a great woman whom I loved.<br> - This man is an intruder in my home!<br> - It's not yours yet, Dmitri.<br> Only when probate is granted,<br> and the Deed of Entitlement...<br> You're not getting Boy with Apple,<br> you goddamn little fruit!<br> How's that supposed to make me feel?<br> Call the police.<br> We're pressing charges.<br> This criminal has plagued my family<br> for nearly 20 years.<br> He's a ruthless adventurer<br> and a con-artist<br> who preys on mentally feeble,<br> sick old ladies,<br> and he probably fucks them, too!<br> I go to bed with all my friends.<br> Where's Celine?<br> What? She's dead.<br> We're reading her will.<br> Oh, yes, yes, of course.<br> If I learn you ever once<br> laid a finger on my mother's body,<br> living or dead, I swear to God,<br> I'll cut your throat! You hear me?<br> I thought I was supposed to be<br> a fucking faggot.<br> - You are, but you're bisexual.<br> - Let's change the subject.<br> I'm leaving.<br> That picture, Boy with Apple,<br> is priceless. Understand?<br> Congratulations, Monsieur Gustave!<br> They're going to fight me<br> for the son of a bitch.<br> - Is it very beautiful?<br> - Beyond description.<br> "E'en the most gifted bard's rhyme<br> can only sing<br> "but to the lack of her<br> and all she isn't!<br> - "His tongue doth..."<br> - Can I see it?<br> I don't see why not.<br> This is van Hoytl's<br> exquisite portrayal<br> of a beautiful boy on<br> the cusp of manhood.<br> Blond, smooth.<br> Skin as white as that milk.<br> Of impeccable provenance.<br> One of the last in private hands,<br> and unquestionably, the best.<br> It's a masterpiece.<br> The rest of this shit<br> is worthless junk.<br> What did you want<br> to tell me, before?<br> I think I cannot say right now.<br> Write me tomorrow. Lutzbahn Station!<br> I'll never part with it.<br> It reminded her of me.<br> It will remind me of her. Always.<br> I'll die with this<br> picture above my bed.<br> See the resemblance?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Actually, we should sell it.<br> Sooner rather than later,<br> in case they try to steal it back.<br> Plus, something about those lunatic<br> foot-soldiers on the express...<br> This could be a tricky war and a<br> long dry spell in the hotel trade.<br> For all we know, they could<br> board us up tomorrow.<br> Let's make a solemn blood-pact.<br> We'll contact the black market<br> and liquidate Boy with Apple<br> by the end of the week,<br> then leave the country and lay low<br> somewhere along the Maltese Riviera<br> until the troubles blow over<br> and we resume our posts.<br> In exchange for your<br> help, your loyalty<br> and your services as<br> my personal valet,<br> I pledge to you 1.5%<br> of the net sale price.<br> - 1.5?<br> - Plus room and board.<br> - Could we make it 10?<br> - 10? Are you joking?<br> That's more than I'd<br> pay an actual dealer,<br> and you wouldn't know<br> chiaroscuro from chicken giblets.<br> No, 1.5 is correct. But<br> I'll tell you what,<br> if I die first, and I most certainly<br> will, you will be my sole heir.<br> There's not much in the kitty except<br> a set of ivory-backed hairbrushes<br> and my library of romantic poetry,<br> but when the time comes,<br> these will be yours,<br> along with whatever we haven't<br> already spent on whores and whiskey.<br> This is our sacred bond.<br> I'll draw it up right now.<br> I, Monsieur Gustave H, being of<br> relatively sound mind and body,<br> on this day, the 19th of October,<br> in the year of our Lord 1932...<br> He never told me where he came from.<br> I never asked who his<br> family had been.<br> Excuse me.<br> Uh-huh?<br> The police are here.<br> They asked for you.<br> Tell them I'll be right down.<br> Okay.<br> Have you ever been questioned<br> by the authorities?<br> Yes, on one occasion I was arrested<br> and tortured by the rebel militia<br> after the Desert Uprising.<br> - You know the drill, then. Zip it.<br> - Of course.<br> You've never heard the word "van<br> Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go.<br> How may we serve you, gentlemen?<br> Ah, Inspector Henckels.<br> "By order of the Commissioner<br> of Police, Zubrowka Province,<br> "I hereby place you under arrest<br> for the murder<br> "of Madame Ceine Villeneuve<br> Desgoffe und Taxis."<br> I knew there was something fishy.<br> We never got the cause of death.<br> She's been murdered and<br> you think I did it.<br> Hey!<br> Stop!<br> What happened?<br> What happened, my dear Zero,<br> is I beat the living shit<br> out of a sniveling little runt<br> called Pinky Bandinski<br> who had the gall to<br> question my virility,<br> because if there's one thing we've<br> learned from penny dreadfuls,<br> it's that, when you find yourself<br> in a place like this,<br> you must never be a candy-ass.<br> You've got to prove<br> yourself from Day One.<br> You've got to win their respect.<br> You should take a long look<br> at his ugly mug this morning.<br> He's, actually,<br> become a dear friend.<br> You'll meet him, I hope.<br> So. You've talked to Kovacs?<br> I saw him last night in secret.<br> He made me take an oath on a<br> Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.<br> - You're supposed to also.<br> - I'll do that later.<br> - He suspects you're innocent.<br> - Of course he does.<br> What's the charge?<br> In the small hours<br> of the evening of 19 October,<br> an individual well-known to the house<br> and staff, a Monsieur Gustave H,<br> did arrive at the Desgoffe<br> und Taxis residence in Lutz<br> and entered by the<br> rear service alley,<br> alerting no one to his presence,<br> and did then proceed by way of<br> back stairs and servants' passage,<br> to deliver himself into<br> the private chambers of Madame D.<br> There is no evidence<br> to indicate whether this visit<br> had been pre-arranged<br> with her or not.<br> The next morning Madame D was<br> found dead by strychnine poisoning.<br> Monsieur Gustave was not observed<br> on the premises again<br> until, of course, 24 hours later.<br> The identity of his accusers is made<br> clear in this notarized deposition.<br> They include, essentially,<br> all members of the extended family,<br> but the key witness who actually<br> ostensibly saw the alleged events<br> appears to have fled<br> the jurisdiction.<br> His whereabouts are<br> currently unknown,<br> but he's being sought and pursued<br> by the relevant authorities.<br> Who is he?<br> - Serge?<br> - I'm afraid so.<br> That little prick.<br> No, I don't believe it.<br> They put him up to it.<br> I've been dropped into<br> a nest of vipers.<br> You have an alibi?<br> Of course, but she's married<br> to the Duke of Westphalia.<br> I can't allow her name to get<br> mixed-up in all this monkey business.<br> - Your life may be at stake.<br> - I know, but the bitch legged it.<br> She's already onboard the Queen<br> Nasstasja halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.<br> Don't give up.<br> The details of the conspiracy,<br> now a matter of public record,<br> were, at that time,<br> impossible for us to apprehend.<br> I'm looking for Serge X,<br> a young man in the<br> service of my employer,<br> the family Desgoffe und Taxis<br> of Schloss Lutz.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - You're his sister?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Seen him lately?<br> - No, sir.<br> - No, sir?<br> No, sir.<br> I need to find him right away,<br> for his own safety<br> and everybody else's.<br> If he shows up...<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - Tell him Jopling says,<br> "Come home."<br> But one thing was certain,<br> the Desgoffe und Taxis<br> were a very powerful family,<br> and time was not on our side.<br> A letter from Monsieur Gustave.<br> Zero.<br> - You want me to?<br> - Read it.<br> "My dear and trusted colleagues..."<br> I miss you deeply<br> as I write from the confines<br> of my regrettable<br> and preposterous incarceration.<br> Until I walk amongst you again<br> as a free man,<br> the Grand Budapest remains<br> in your hands,<br> as does its impeccable reputation.<br> Keep it spotless and glorify it.<br> Take extra special care<br> of every little-bitty bit of it<br> as if I were watching<br> over you like a hawk<br> with a horse whip in its talons,<br> because I am.<br> Should I discover a lapse<br> of any variety during my absence,<br> I promise, swift and merciless<br> justice will descend upon you.<br> A great and noble house has been<br> placed under your protection.<br> Tell Zero if you see<br> any funny business.<br> "Your devoted Monsieur Gustave."<br> Then there's a poem, but we<br> might want to start on the soup<br> since it's 46 stanzas.<br> "A moist, black ash dampens the<br> filth of a dung-dark rat's nest<br> "and mingles with the thick scent<br> of wood rot<br> "while the lark song<br> of a guttersnipe..."<br> I never trusted that butler.<br> - He's too honest.<br> - Too honest, you say?<br> Right, well, be that as it may,<br> find him quick and make it snappy.<br> May I offer any of you inmates<br> a plate of mush?<br> No? Anyone?<br> You with the very large<br> scar on your face?<br> Try it. It's actually quite warm<br> and nourishing this morning.<br> It needs a dash of salt.<br> Good day.<br> Mush, gents? Any takers?<br> Suit yourselves.<br> Rise and shine. Chop, chop.<br> Good morning, Pinky.<br> - Mendl's again?<br> - Precisely.<br> Who's got the throat slitter?<br> - Out of this world.<br> - Mendl's is the best.<br> - Well, back to work.<br> - Monsieur Gustave?<br> Yes?<br> Me and the boys talked it over.<br> We think you're a<br> really straight fellow.<br> Well, I've never been accused<br> of that before,<br> but I appreciate the sentiment.<br> You're one of us now.<br> What a lovely thing to say.<br> Thank you, dear Pinky.<br> Thank you, Gnther.<br> Thank you, Wolf.<br> Anything else?<br> Tell him, Ludwig.<br> Checkpoint 19 ain't<br> no two-bit hoosegow.<br> You got broad-gauge iron bars<br> on every door, vent and window.<br> You got 72 guards on the floor<br> and 16 more in the towers.<br> You got a 325-foot drop<br> into a moat full of crocodiles.<br> But, like the best of them,<br> it's got a soft spot,<br> which in this case<br> happens to take the form<br> of a storm-drain sewer system<br> dating from the time<br> of the original rock fortification<br> way back in the Middle Ages.<br> Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll<br> down a tree-lined promenade<br> with a fine lady and a white poodle,<br> but it's got what you'd<br> call "vulnerability,"<br> and that's our bread and butter.<br> Take a look.<br> Who drew this?<br> What do you mean,<br> "Who drew this?" I did.<br> Very good. You've got a<br> wonderful line, Ludwig.<br> This shows great artistic promise.<br> Question, how do you intend<br> to penetrate this lowest rudiment?<br> It's 25 inches of reinforced<br> granite masonry, is it not?<br> Digging with the throat-slitter,<br> I expect this would take three<br> to six months of continual effort,<br> during which time<br> several of our members<br> will have been violently executed.<br> You hit the nail on the<br> head, Mr. Gustave.<br> We got fake documents,<br> second-hand street clothes,<br> a rope ladder made of<br> sticks and bunk-linens,<br> but we need digging tools,<br> which are proving hard to come by<br> in this flop-house.<br> At this point in the story,<br> the old man fell silent<br> and pushed away his saddle of lamb.<br> His eyes went blank as two stones.<br> I could see he was in distress.<br> - Are you ill, Mr. Moustafa?<br> - I finally asked.<br> - Oh, dear me, no.<br> - He said.<br> It's only that I don't<br> know how to proceed.<br> He was crying.<br> You see, I never speak of Agatha,<br> because even at the<br> thought of her name<br> I'm unable to control my emotions.<br> Well, I suppose there's<br> no way around it.<br> You see, she saved us.<br> On our third formal rendezvous,<br> I had asked for her hand in marriage<br> and she had agreed.<br> - Will you marry me?<br> - Yes.<br> We did not have 50 Klubecks<br> between the two of us.<br> No one knew, of course,<br> but, then, who would have cared?<br> We were each<br> completely on our own in the world,<br> and we were deeply in love.<br> - Here.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's a book.<br> - I see.<br> Romantic Poetry, Volume One.<br> Monsieur Gustave recommended it.<br> I have a copy of my own as well.<br> - I ruined the surprise, I suppose.<br> - I'll go ahead and open it, anyway.<br> Read the inscription.<br> Monsieur Gustave insisted<br> on an immediate<br> and thorough cross-examination...<br> She's charming. She's so charming.<br> during which he presented Agatha<br> with a porcelain pendant<br> and five dozen individually<br> tissue-wrapped white tulips<br> in a box the size of<br> a child's coffin.<br> - It's not right.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> Why is he sulking?<br> She's my girlfriend.<br> You can't just buy her things.<br> I'm only interviewing this vision<br> of loveliness on your behalf.<br> Never be jealous in this life, Zero,<br> not even for an instant.<br> Is he flirting with you?<br> - Yes.<br> - I approve of this union.<br> Agatha, my beauty,<br> return to your beloved.<br> Soon we learned...<br> Blessings upon you both.<br> not only was Agatha<br> immensely skilled<br> with a palette knife<br> and a butter-cream flourish...<br> - Mendl.<br> - Go.<br> she was also very brave.<br> I believe she was born that way.<br> Something's missing.<br> A crucial document, either misplaced<br> or, conceivably, destroyed.<br> I don't know what it contains,<br> I don't know what it represents,<br> I don't know what it is,<br> but there are traces<br> and shadows of it everywhere.<br> Now, I don't want to alarm you,<br> and I don't expect to see any<br> significant change<br> in the magistrate's ultimate decision<br> vis-a-vis your own inheritance,<br> but, especially given the<br> circumstances of the death,<br> as well as the disappearance of the key<br> witness in the murder case, Serge X,<br> I suggest that<br> we immediately bring this matter<br> to the attention of the<br> municipal inspector<br> so that there can be<br> absolutely no question<br> of impropriety at any future date.<br> - Agreed?<br> - Not agreed.<br> - Not agreed?<br> - Not agreed.<br> - Can I ask you a question, Vilmos?<br> - Yes, Dmitri?<br> - Who are you working for?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> Who are you working for? I thought<br> you're supposed to be our lawyer.<br> Well, in point of fact,<br> I'm the executor of the estate.<br> In this particular situation,<br> I represent the deceased.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Yeah. A provision for my fees<br> was included in the...<br> Just wrap it up<br> and don't make waves. Agreed?<br> I'm an attorney. I'm obligated to<br> proceed according to the rule of law.<br> Not agreed.<br> This stinks, sisters.<br> Did he just throw my<br> cat out the window?<br> I don't think so.<br> - No. Did he?<br> - Jopling?<br> Okay.<br> There's something<br> I haven't told you, Agatha.<br> - Okay.<br> - We stole a painting.<br> It's very valuable, maybe five<br> million Klubecks, in fact.<br> I don't know if anyone's<br> even noticed it's missing yet,<br> but if something<br> should happen to me...<br> You steal art?<br> One picture. Anyway, we need<br> to make a plan for your survival.<br> Hide this. It's in code and you might<br> need a magnifying glass to read it,<br> but it tells you exactly where<br> and how to find Boy with Apple.<br> Don't take less than half<br> the retail asking price. Also...<br> - Zero, I'm a baker.<br> - You're a pastry chef.<br> I'm not a fence, if that's the term.<br> I don't trade in stolen property.<br> I said it wrong.<br> She willed it to him.<br> Go to sleep.<br> Yes, Herr Mendl.<br> - Hide this.<br> - No.<br> Okay, but take it anyway.<br> The next morning,<br> Herr Becker received a peculiar,<br> last-minute notice<br> from the office of Deputy Kovacs,<br> postponing their scheduled meeting,<br> in perpetuity.<br> Let's blow.<br> - How did you get out there?<br> - Shut the fuck up.<br> These guys are trying to escape.<br> What's wrong with you,<br> you goddamn snitch?<br> Guard! Guard!<br> It's you. Thank you.<br> Thank you, you sweet, kind man.<br> Okay.<br> I suppose you'd call that a draw.<br> Good evening.<br> Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf,<br> Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.<br> Gnther was slain in the catacombs.<br> Well, boys, who knows when we'll<br> all meet again, but if one day...<br> Hold it.<br> No time to gab.<br> Take care of yourself, Mr. Gustave.<br> Good luck, kid.<br> - Which way to the safe house?<br> - I couldn't find one.<br> No safe house? Really?<br> We're completely on our own out here?<br> I'm afraid so.<br> I asked around, but...<br> I understand. Too risky. We'll<br> just have to wing it, I suppose.<br> Let's put on our disguises.<br> - We're wearing them.<br> - No, we're not.<br> We said false whiskers<br> and fake noses and so on.<br> - You didn't bring any?<br> - I thought you were growing one.<br> And it wouldn't look<br> realistic, would it?<br> No, when done properly,<br> they're perfectly convincing.<br> But I take your point. So be it.<br> Give me a few squirts of<br> L'air de Panache, please, will you?<br> - Can I not get a squirt, even?<br> - I forgot the L'air de Panache.<br> Honestly, you forgot<br> the L'air de Panache?<br> I don't believe it. How could you?<br> I've been in jail, Zero! Do you<br> understand how humiliating this is?<br> I smell.<br> That's just marvelous, isn't it?<br> I suppose this is to be expected back<br> in... Where do you come from again?<br> - Aq Salim al-Jabat.<br> - Precisely.<br> I suppose this is to be expected<br> back in Aq Salim al-Jabat<br> where one's prized possessions<br> are a stack of filthy carpets<br> and a starving goat,<br> and one sleeps behind a tent flap and<br> survives on wild dates and scarabs.<br> But it's not how I trained you.<br> What on God's earth<br> possessed you to leave<br> the homeland where<br> you obviously belong<br> and travel unspeakable distances<br> to become a penniless immigrant<br> in a refined,<br> highly-cultivated society<br> that, quite frankly, could've<br> gotten along very well without you?<br> The war.<br> Say again?<br> Well, you see, my father was murdered<br> and the rest of my family were<br> executed by firing squad.<br> Our village was burned to the ground<br> and those who managed to<br> survive were forced to flee.<br> I left because of the war.<br> I see. So you're, actually, really<br> more of a refugee, in that sense?<br> Truly.<br> Well, I suppose I'd better take<br> back everything I just said.<br> What a bloody idiot I am.<br> Pathetic fool.<br> Goddamn, selfish bastard.<br> This is disgraceful, and it's beneath<br> the standards of the Grand Budapest.<br> I apologize on behalf of the hotel.<br> It's not your fault. You were<br> just upset I forgot the perfume.<br> Don't make excuses for me.<br> I owe you my life.<br> You are my dear friend and protg<br> and I'm very proud of you.<br> You must know that.<br> I'm so sorry, Zero.<br> We're brothers.<br> How's our darling Agatha?<br> "'Twas first light<br> when I saw her face upon the heath,<br> "and hence did I return,<br> day-by-day, entranced,<br> "tho' vinegar did brine<br> my heart, never..."<br> Very good. I'm going to stop you<br> there because the alarm has sounded,<br> but remember where we left off<br> because I insist you finish later.<br> I want roadblocks<br> at every junction for 50km.<br> I want rail blocks<br> at every train station for 100km.<br> I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds<br> ready in five minutes.<br> We're going to strip-search every<br> pretzel-Haus, Waffel-hut, Biergarten<br> and especially every grand hotel<br> from Augenzburg to Zilchbrock.<br> These men are dangerous,<br> professional criminals.<br> At least three of them are anyway.<br> Who are you?<br> What are you doing here? Civilian personnel<br> aren't permitted in the cellblock.<br> - This is a military investigation.<br> - This is Mr. Jopling, sir.<br> His employer's mother<br> was one of the victims...<br> Shut up.<br> You work for the family<br> Desgoffe und Taxis?<br> Are you aware of the murder of Deputy<br> Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October?<br> I'm aware of his disappearance.<br> His body was found stuffed in<br> a sarcophagus behind a storage room<br> at the Kunstmuseum late last night.<br> He was short four fingers.<br> - What do you know about that?<br> - Nothing.<br> Escort Mr. Jopling off the premises.<br> Mendl's.<br> Operator, get me the Excelsior<br> Palace in Baden-Jurgen<br> and reverse the charges, please.<br> We've no choice.<br> There's nowhere else to turn.<br> I'll hold. Thank you.<br> It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't<br> even mention its existence to you.<br> It goes without saying, never breathe<br> a word about this to a living soul.<br> - Do you swear?<br> - Of course. What is it, in fact?<br> I can't say.<br> How does one come by<br> front-row aisle seats<br> for a first night at the Opera<br> Toscana with one day's notice?<br> How does one arrange<br> a private viewing<br> of the tapestry collection<br> at the Royal Saxon Gallery?<br> How does one secure a corner table<br> at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?<br> Ivan, darling, it's Gustave. Hello.<br> Well, I was until about<br> five minutes ago.<br> We've taken it upon ourselves to clear<br> out in a hurry if you see what I mean.<br> Well, through a sewer,<br> as it happens. Exactly.<br> Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to cut you<br> off, but we're in a bit of a bind.<br> This is an official request.<br> I'm formally calling<br> upon the special services of...<br> I'll call you back, Gustave.<br> Right. Stand by.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Do you prefer to walk?<br> We're right here. It's very simple.<br> Straight down the<br> corniche, then left.<br> Jojo, see the gentleman out.<br> Get me Monsieur Georges<br> at the Chteau Luxe, please.<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Take over.<br> Happy birthday, dear...<br> Hello, Ivan?<br> Got it.<br> Get me Monsieur Dino<br> at the Palazzo Principessa, please.<br> Higher, goddammit, higher!<br> Take over.<br> - Monsieur Georges.<br> - Higher.<br> I see. Straightaway.<br> Get me Monsieur Robin<br> at l'Hotel Cote du Cap, please.<br> and two and three.<br> Monsieur Robin. There's a call<br> from Monsieur Dino for you.<br> Take over.<br> - One, two, three.<br> - Yes, Dino.<br> Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.<br> Get me Monsieur Martin<br> at the Ritz Imperial, please.<br> Too much salt.<br> Not enough pepper.<br> Take over.<br> - Robin? Martin.<br> - Too much salt.<br> So I've heard.<br> Maybe. Let me make a few calls.<br> Serge X, missing.<br> Deputy Kovacs, also missing.<br> Madame D, dead.<br> Boy with Apple, stolen, by us.<br> Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless,<br> cold-blooded savages.<br> Gustave H, at large. What else?<br> - Zero, confused.<br> - Zero, confused, indeed.<br> The plot "thickens," as they say.<br> Why, by the way?<br> Is it a soup metaphor?<br> I don't know.<br> Get in.<br> We found the butler.<br> He's hiding out in the remote<br> foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak.<br> Our contact convinced him<br> to meet you midday tomorrow<br> at the observatory on the summit.<br> Tell no one.<br> He'll explain everything.<br> Your train departs<br> in four and a half minutes.<br> Here's your tickets.<br> - Third class?<br> - It was overbooked<br> but the conductor used to be<br> a sommelier at the old Versailles.<br> He pulled some strings.<br> You'll need these<br> for the dining car.<br> One last thing.<br> L'air de Panache.<br> They only had the half-ounce.<br> We should give him something<br> as a symbolic gesture.<br> - How much money you got?<br> - 42 Klubecks and 3 postage stamps.<br> Give me 25. Yes.<br> - Bless you.<br> - Please.<br> - I've got to hand it to him.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> I didn't see that coming.<br> Well, what do you want next?<br> Talk to the club-footed sister again,<br> and, this time, be persuasive.<br> Goddamn son of a bitch.<br> Holy fuck!<br> What's the meaning of this shit?<br> Boy with Apple? I thought<br> you'd hidden it.<br> - Why are you only noticing now?<br> - I assumed it went to the tax appraiser.<br> Are you fucking kidding me?<br> I believe it was removed<br> by Monsieur Gustave.<br> I'm not angry with Serge.<br> You can't blame someone<br> for their basic lack of moral fiber.<br> He's a frightened, little,<br> yellow-bellied coward.<br> - It's not his fault, is it?<br> - I don't know. It depends.<br> Well, you can say that<br> about most anything.<br> "It depends." Of course it depends.<br> Of course it depends.<br> Of course it depends.<br> Yes, I suppose you're right.<br> Of course it depends.<br> That doesn't mean I'm not going<br> to throttle the little swamp rat.<br> May I officiate, by the way?<br> The ceremony?<br> With pleasure.<br> I must say, I find that<br> girl utterly delightful.<br> Flat as a board, enormous birthmark<br> the shape of Mexico<br> over half her face,<br> sweating for hours on end<br> in that sweltering kitchen<br> while Mendl, genius though he is,<br> looms over her like<br> a hulking gorilla.<br> Yet without question, without fail,<br> always and invariably,<br> she's exceedingly lovely.<br> Why?<br> Because of her purity.<br> She admires you as well,<br> Monsieur Gustave.<br> - Does she?<br> - Very much.<br> That's a good sign, you know.<br> It means she "gets it."<br> That's important.<br> Don't flirt with her.<br> A radio telegram was delivered and<br> signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM.<br> The envelope was found near the body,<br> but its contents were missing.<br> However, the telegraph office always keeps<br> a carbon of the ticker tape for 24 hours.<br> I copied it down.<br> It reads as follows,<br> "Pack your things stop.<br> "Be ready to leave<br> at moment's notice stop.<br> "Hide-out is vicinity<br> of Gabelmeister's Peak stop.<br> "Destroy this message<br> all my love full stop."<br> Where's the basket?<br> Where you headed, mister?<br> Skiing? Sledding? Mountain climbing?<br> Three Klubecks.<br> By express wireless, I wrote Agatha<br> with instructions to move<br> to our pre-arranged hideout,<br> a Gypsy caravan<br> on the outer Nebelsbad road,<br> while Monsieur Gustave<br> and I continued east<br> into the Zubrowkian Alps,<br> toward our high-altitude rendezvous<br> with the butler Serge X.<br> As a precaution, we<br> disembarked quietly<br> in the freight yard just<br> outside the station.<br> L'air de Panache.<br> It's a hell of a view. I give<br> them that, for what's it's worth.<br> I agree.<br> "'Tis oft'-remarked, no single,<br> falling-flake does any other<br> - "in its pure and perfect form..."<br> - Somebody's coming.<br> Are you Monsieur Gustave<br> of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Get on the next cable car.<br> Are you Monsieur Gustave of the<br> Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Switch with me.<br> Are you Monsieur Gustave of the<br> Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Put these on and sing.<br> - Are you Monsieur Gustave of the...<br> - Yes, dammit.<br> Confess.<br> I'm innocent.<br> Hmm? No, no.<br> Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave.<br> I never meant to betray you.<br> They threatened my life and now<br> they've murdered my only family.<br> No. Who did they kill this time?<br> - My dear sister.<br> - The girl with the club foot?<br> - Yes.<br> - Those fuckers!<br> I tried to warn you<br> at the beginning.<br> I know, darling. Let's<br> put that behind us.<br> Listen, I hate to put you on the spot, but<br> I really must ask you to clear my name.<br> - Obviously you're grieving...<br> - There's more.<br> - To the story.<br> - I get it. Go on.<br> I was the official witness<br> in Madame D's presence<br> to the creation of a second will<br> to be executed only in the event<br> of her death by murder.<br> - A second will?<br> - Right.<br> - In case she got bumped off?<br> - Right.<br> - Uh-huh?<br> - But they destroyed it.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - However...<br> - Uh-huh?<br> - I pulled a copy.<br> A second copy of the second will?<br> - Right.<br> - Uh-huh?<br> What does it say? Where is it?<br> What's it all about, dammit?<br> Don't keep us in suspense. This has<br> been a complete fucking nightmare.<br> Just tell us what the<br> fuck is going on!<br> Serge? Serge? Serge!<br> Bloody hell.<br> They've strangled the poor slob.<br> Come on! Let's go!<br> - What do we do if we catch him?<br> - I don't know.<br> He's a homicidal psychopath.<br> Let's stop.<br> I can't. I can barely steer.<br> You sick, pathetic creep.<br> I hate you.<br> "'If this do be me end, farewell!'<br> cried the wounded piper-boy,<br> "whilst the muskets cracked<br> and the yeomen roared 'Hurrah!'<br> "And the ramparts fell.<br> "'Methinks me breathes me last,<br> me fears!' said he..."<br> Holy shit! You got him!<br> Well done, Zero!<br> Gustave H! You are a<br> fugitive from justice!<br> Surrender lawfully<br> and I will personally vouchsafe<br> your fair treatment.<br> Do not attempt to flee!<br> - What do you think?<br> - I don't know.<br> I'd rather jump off this cliff right now<br> than go back to fucking prison.<br> I say we steal that sick maniac's<br> motorcycle, go fetch Agatha,<br> take back Boy with Apple and head for<br> the Maltese Riviera, once and for all.<br> Very good! You're so extraordinary, Zero.<br> Thank you.<br> A moment of silence<br> in memoriam of a devoted servant<br> killed violently<br> during the conduct of his duties.<br> Goodbye, Serge.<br> Okay, let's go.<br> The war began at midnight.<br> Pffeifelstad fell by lunch<br> under heavy shelling,<br> and 10 battalions surged across<br> the long western border.<br> High-command advanced to Nebelsbad.<br> Compliments of Herr Mendl,<br> for the executive staff.<br> General Stieglitz requests a garden-view<br> sitting room with an extra roll-away.<br> Let's put him in the<br> Duke Leopold Suite.<br> Secretary Woroniecki's<br> office cabled.<br> He's checking in a day early.<br> Rooms 401-2-3.<br> Tell Tactical Logistics<br> we're moving them<br> to a standard double<br> on the third floor.<br> They'll need more space than that.<br> The beginning of the end of the end<br> of the beginning has begun.<br> A sad finale played off-key<br> on a broken-down saloon piano<br> in the outskirts of a<br> forgotten ghost town.<br> I'd rather not bear witness<br> to such blasphemy.<br> Me neither.<br> The Grand Budapest<br> has become a troops' barracks.<br> I shall never cross<br> its threshold again in my lifetime.<br> - Me neither.<br> - Never again shall I...<br> Actually, I think we might be<br> going in there right now after all.<br> Dmitri.<br> Agatha.<br> Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.<br> I'm Monsieur Chuck.<br> We've booked you and your sisters<br> into the King Ferdinand Suite.<br> Good evening.<br> General von Shrecker asked me...<br> - Who's that?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> I think that girl's got my picture.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Six.<br> - Hold it.<br> Six.<br> Compliments of Herr Mendl.<br> Excuse me.<br> Have you seen a pastry girl<br> with a package under her arm<br> in the last minute and a half?<br> Yep. She just got on the elevator<br> with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm sorry. Who are you?<br> - Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy.<br> - You haven't been trained properly.<br> A Lobby Boy never provides<br> information of that kind.<br> You're a stone wall. Understood?<br> Pretty picture.<br> Sixth floor.<br> Where's Boy with Apple?<br> None of your goddamn business!<br> I'm going to blast your candy-ass<br> once and for all right now.<br> Drop your weapon!<br> - Cease fire! Cease fire!<br> - Whoa!<br> Stop it!<br> Who's shooting who?<br> That's Gustave H!<br> The escaped murderer and art thief.<br> I've got him cornered!<br> That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis!<br> He's responsible for the killing<br> of Deputy Kovacs,<br> Serge X and his club-footed sister,<br> plus his own mother!<br> Nobody move.<br> Everybody's under arrest.<br> Who's out the window?<br> Agatha!<br> Hang on! Here I come!<br> Something's on the back of the...<br> Agatha!<br> Agatha!<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I think so.<br> Something's on the<br> back of the picture.<br> She left everything<br> to Monsieur Gustave, of course.<br> The mansion, known as Schloss Lutz,<br> the factories, which produced<br> weapons, medicine and textiles,<br> an important newspaper syndicate,<br> and perhaps you've already deduced<br> this very institution,<br> the Grand Budapest Hotel.<br> He anointed me his successor,<br> and as the war continued,<br> I served my adopted country<br> from the narrow desk still found<br> against the wall in the next room.<br> He was the same as his disciples,<br> insecure, vain,<br> superficial, blond, needy.<br> In the end he was even rich.<br> He did not succeed, however,<br> in growing old.<br> "Dearly beloved,<br> we are gathered together..."<br> Nor did my darling Agatha.<br> She and our infant son<br> would be killed two years later<br> by the Prussian grippe.<br> An absurd little disease.<br> Today we treat it in a single week,<br> but, in those days many millions died.<br> On the 21st day of the occupation,<br> the morning<br> the independent state of Zubrowka<br> officially ceased to exist,<br> we traveled<br> with Monsieur Gustave to Lutz.<br> In answer to your earlier question,<br> by the way,<br> of course.<br> Zero asked me about my humble<br> beginnings in the hotel trade.<br> I was, perhaps, for a time,<br> considered the best Lobby Boy<br> we'd ever had at the Grand Budapest.<br> I think I can say that.<br> This one finally surpassed me.<br> Although, I must say,<br> he had an exceptional teacher.<br> Truly.<br> "Whence came these two<br> radiant, celestial brothers,<br> "united, for an instant,<br> "as they crossed the stratosphere<br> of our starry window?<br> "One from the East<br> and one from the West."<br> Very good.<br> Don't flirt with her.<br> Why are we stopping<br> at a barley field again?<br> I find these black<br> uniforms very drab.<br> Well, hello there, chaps.<br> We were just talking about you.<br> - Documents, please.<br> - With pleasure, as always.<br> You're the first of the<br> official death squads<br> to whom we've been<br> formally introduced.<br> How do you do?<br> Plus a change, am I right?<br> That's a migratory visa with<br> stage three worker status, darling.<br> Read this.<br> - Come outside.<br> - Now, stay there.<br> I give you my word,<br> if you lay a finger on this man,<br> I'll see you<br> dishonorably discharged,<br> locked up in the stockade<br> and hanged by sundown.<br> There are still faint<br> glimmers of civilization<br> left in this barbaric slaughterhouse<br> that was once known as humanity.<br> You filthy, goddamn,<br> pock-marked, fascist assholes!<br> He was one of them.<br> What more is there to say?<br> What happened in the end?<br> In the end they shot him.<br> So it all went to me.<br> After dinner, we went to collect<br> the keys to our rooms,<br> but Monsieur Jean had<br> abandoned his post.<br> I expect he's forgotten<br> all about us.<br> In recent years, of course,<br> such properties and holdings<br> as the Grand Budapest<br> had with very few exceptions<br> become common property.<br> While the precise terms<br> of his negotiation<br> with the new government<br> had never been announced,<br> the result was an open secret,<br> Zero Moustafa had traded<br> a great and important fortune<br> in exchange for one costly,<br> unprofitable, doomed hotel.<br> Why?<br> Was it merely sentimental?<br> It was quite forward of me<br> and a bit out of character,<br> but I felt I must know,<br> for my health, I suppose.<br> Forgive me for asking.<br> I hope I haven't upset you.<br> No, of course not.<br> Is it simply your last connection<br> to that vanished world,<br> his world, if you will?<br> His world?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> You see, we shared a vocation.<br> It wouldn't have been necessary.<br> No. The hotel I keep for Agatha.<br> We were happy here.<br> For a little while.<br> To be frank, I think<br> his world had vanished<br> long before he ever entered it.<br> But, I will say,<br> he certainly sustained the illusion<br> with a marvelous grace.<br> - Are you going up?<br> - No, I'll sit for a little while.<br> Good night.<br> The next week,<br> I sailed for a cure in South America<br> and began a long,<br> wandering journey abroad.<br> I did not return to<br> Europe for many years.<br> It was an enchanting old ruin.<br>
