Ask me anything.<br> - I didn't mean nothin'.<br> Me, neither. I'm just trying to get along<br> without shoving anybody, that's all.<br> See that road ahead?<br> That's where I get out.<br> You're about to bust a gut<br> to know what I done, ain't you?<br> Well, I ain't a guy<br> to let you down.<br> Homicide.<br> Mm-mmm, He's my savior <br> Mmm, mmm, mmm, my savior <br> Mmm, mmm, mmm<br> my savior now <br> - Howdy, friend.<br> - Howdy.<br> Say, ain't you young Tom Joad,<br> old Tom's boy?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm on my way home now.<br> Well, I do declare.<br> I baptized you, son.<br> Ain't you the preacher?<br> Used to be.<br> Not no more.<br> I lost the call.<br> But, boy,<br> I sure used to have it.<br> I used to get an irrigation ditch so<br> squirmin' full of repented sinners...<br> I'd pretty near<br> drown half of'em.<br> But not no more.<br> I lost the spirit.<br> I got nothin' to preach about<br> no more, that's all.<br> I ain't so sure of things.<br> I remember you preachin'<br> a whole sermon...<br> walkin' around on your hands,<br> shoutin' your head off.<br> Yeah, I remember.<br> Went pretty good that way.<br> But that was nothin'.<br> Why, I preached a whole sermon<br> once straddlin' the ridgepole of a barn...<br> like this.<br> - You see that one?<br> - No.<br> - You see that one?<br> - No.<br> You didn't?<br> Oh.<br> Well, it's all gone,<br> anyway.<br> You should've<br> got yourself a wife.<br> Why, at my meetings, I used to get the girls<br> a-glory-shoutin' till they about pass out.<br> Then I'd go<br> to comfort 'em.<br> I'd always end up<br> by lovin' 'em.<br> I'd feel bad and pray and pray,<br> but it didn't do no good.<br> Next time,<br> do it again.<br> I figured I just<br> wasn't worth savin'.<br> [Chuckles] Pa always says you was<br> never cut out for no preacher.<br> I never let one get by me<br> if I could catch her. Have a snort?<br> But you wasn't<br> a preacher!<br> A girl was just<br> a girl to you.<br> To me,<br> they's holy vessels.<br> I was savin'<br> their souls.<br> I asked myself, what is this here<br> called "Holy Spirit"?<br> Maybe that's love.<br> Why, I love<br> everybody so much...<br> I'm fit to bust<br> sometimes!<br> So maybe there ain't no sin<br> and there ain't no virtue.<br> It's just<br> what people does.<br> Some things folks do is nice<br> and some ain't so nice.<br> And that's all any man's<br> got a right to say.<br> Of course, I'll say a grace<br> if somebody sets out the food...<br> but my heart<br> ain't in it.<br> - Nice drinkin' liquor.<br> - Yeah, it ought to be.<br> That's factory liquor. Cost me a buck.<br> You been out<br> travelin' around?<br> Oh, ain't you heard?<br> It's been in the papers.<br> - No, I never.

He had a knife in me...<br> That's why they only give me seven years.<br> I got out in four... parole.<br> - Ain't seen your folks since?<br> - No, but I aim to 'fore sundown.<br> And I'm gettin' excited about it too.<br> Which way you goin'?<br> Oh, it don't matter.<br> Ever since I lost<br> the spirit, I'd...<br> it looks like I'd just as soon go one way<br> as the other.<br> I'll go your way.<br> - [Dog Barking]<br> - Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper.<br> I ain't had pork but four times<br> in four years... every Christmas.<br> I'll be glad<br> to see your pa.<br> [Laughs]<br> Last time I seen him was at a baptizin'.<br> He had one of the biggest doses<br> of the Holy Spirit I ever seen.<br> Got to jumpin' over bushes, howlin'<br> like a dog-wolf at moon time.<br> Finally, he picks hisself<br> out a bush big as a piano.<br> And he lets out a squawk<br> and takes a run at that bush.<br> [Howls]<br> Well, he cleared her...<br> but he busted his leg<br> snap 'n two doin' it.<br> [Laughs] There was a travelin' dentist<br> there and he set her...<br> and I give her<br> a prayin' over...<br> but there wasn't no more<br> Holy Spirit left in your pa after that.<br> [Wind Howling]<br> Listen.<br> That wind's fixin'to do somethin'.<br> Sure, it is.<br> Always is this time of year.<br> Ma?<br> Pa?<br> Ma?<br> Ain't nobody here?<br> Something's happened.<br> You got a match?<br> They're all gone<br> or dead.<br> - They never wrote you nothin'?<br> - Nah, they wasn't people to write.<br> It's Ma's.<br> She had 'em for years.<br> Used to be mine.<br> I give it to Grandpa when I went away.<br> You reckon they're dead?<br> I never heard<br> nothin' about it.<br> [Creaking]<br> [Man]<br> Tommy?<br> - [Tom] Muley.! Where's my folks, Muley?<br> - Why, they gone.<br> I know they're gone,<br> but where they gone?<br> It's Muley Graves. You remember<br> the preacher, don't you?<br> - I ain't no preacher anymore.<br> - All right.

It's a company.<br> They got a president,<br> ain't they?<br> They got somebody that knows<br> what a shotgun's for, ain't they?<br> Oh, son, it ain't his fault,<br> because the bank tells him what to do.<br> All right,<br> where's the bank?<br> Tulsa.<br> And what's the use of pickin' on him?<br> He ain't nothin' but the manager,<br> and he's half crazy hisself...<br> tryin' to keepin' up with<br> his orders from the East.<br> - Then who do we shoot?<br> - Brother, I don't know.<br> If I did, I'd tell you.<br> I just don't know who's to blame.<br> Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, there<br> ain't nobody gonna push me off my land!<br> My grandpa took up this land<br> My pa was born here!<br> We was all born on it!<br> And some of us<br> was killed on it!<br> And some of us... died on it.<br> And that's what makes it our'n...<br> bein' born on it...<br> and workin' on it...<br> and dyin'... dyin' on it!<br> And not no piece of paper<br> with writin' on it...

I seen her nearly beat a peddler<br> to death with a live chicken.<br> She aimed to go for him with the ax<br> she had in her other hand.<br> She got mixed up,<br> forgot which was which...<br> and when she got through with that peddler,<br> all she had left was two chicken legs.<br> Just a... Just a plain,<br> old graveyard ghost.<br> That's all.<br> She's settlin'.<br> What do you figure<br> on doin'?<br> Ah, it's hard to say.<br> Stay here till morning.<br> Go to UncleJohn's, I reckon.<br> After that, I don't know.<br> - [Vehicle Approaching]<br> - Listen.<br> That's them... them lights.<br> Come on! Come on!<br> We got to hide out.<br> Hide out for what?<br> We ain't doin' nothin'.<br> Well, you're trespassing, Tom!<br> This ain't your land no more, and that's<br> the superintendent with a gun. Come on!<br> Come on, Tom.<br> You're on parole.<br> Muley!<br> All you got to do<br> is hide and watch.<br> - Won't they come out here?<br> - [Laughs] I don't think so.<br> - One came out once<br> and I clipped him from behi...<br> - Shh.<br> [Softly]<br> Behind with-with a fence stake.<br> They ain't bothered since.<br> He ain't here.<br> If anybody ever told me I'd be hiding out<br> at my own place...<br> [Vehicle Departs]<br> [Dog Barking]<br> Lord, make us grateful for what we are<br> about to receive for His sake. Amen.<br> I seen you.<br> You ate durin' grace.<br> Just one little dab!<br> Just one teeny little dab, that's all!<br> Ain't he messy, though?<br> I seen him,<br> gobblin' away like an old pig!<br> Why don't you keep<br> your eyes shut durin' grace, you old...<br> What's it say again,<br> UncleJohn?<br> It says, "Plenty of work<br> in California. 800 pickers wanted."<br> Wait till I get<br> to California!<br> I'm gonna reach up and pick me<br> an orange whenever I want it!<br> Or some grapes! Now...
