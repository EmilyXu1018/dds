Things have been quiet<br> in the ghetto lately.<br> Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel.<br> What's good about it?<br> Conditions could be worse.<br> If you think so,<br> you have a great imagination.<br> You heard Hynkel's speech.<br> I heard nothing.<br> I've got my own troubles.<br> You're better off<br> than a lot of people.<br> What about the barber?<br> Still in hospital.<br> He's been there since the war.<br> Why not rent<br> his barbershop for him?<br> He won't let me. Every few weeks<br> he writes to say he's coming back.<br> A pity it should be idle<br> all these years.<br> Why worry?<br> The government<br> will soon take it from him.<br> Perhaps you're right.<br> Not such a good morning after all.<br> Now you said it.<br> Hannah.<br> On the mantelpiece is my tobacco<br> pouch. Will you get it?<br> Everyone is full of troubles.<br> Yeah, everyone.<br> Look at Hannah, poor girl.<br> A hard worker, can't get a job.<br> Father was killed in the war,<br> mother died last year.<br> Can't earn enough to pay her rent.<br> What can I do?<br> I can't throw her out.<br> You need some more.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.<br> You'd better take the key.<br> Mrs. Jaeckel and I are going out.<br> I'm locking up<br> in case the storm troopers<br> start their monkey business again.<br> Aryan!

Who hit you?<br> I think it was a gang.<br> You'd better get fixed up.<br> We'll investigate later.<br> What time is it?<br> All right, they've gone.<br> Thanks, mister.<br> That did me a lot of good.<br> You've sure got some nerve.<br> We should all fight back.<br> We can't fight alone,<br> but we can lick 'em together.<br> We didn't do so bad.<br> You're the barber,<br> who was in hospital!<br> Mr. Jaeckel has talked about you.<br> We didn't think you'd come back.<br> The storm troopers<br> will be after you.<br> You'd better hide.<br> I'll get the key to the cellar.<br> - Is this the man?<br> - That's him.<br> Hail Hynkel!<br> Who's he?<br> Don't fool with me. Hail Hynkel!<br> Your hands.<br> Just a moment. Not here.<br> Bring him outside.<br> First you'll finish this.<br> Here.<br> Go on, paint that!<br> Wait a minute, boys.<br> I've got a bright idea.<br> Commander Schultz!<br> First in command.<br> Second in command.<br> Oh, never mind. You!<br> Who told you<br> to hang people from lampposts?<br> What was the trouble?<br> A Jew attacking storm troopers.<br> - Where is he?<br> - There.<br> Break ranks.<br> So there you are. Stand him up.<br> Get up.<br> You?<br> Don't you remember me?<br> - You saved my life.<br> - Me?<br> Strange. And I always thought<br> of you as an Aryan.<br> I'm a vegetarian.<br> Don't you remember?<br> We got away in my plane.<br> Plane?<br> Then we crashed.<br> Now I remember.<br> Well, how are you?<br> What's my friend done?<br> He resisted my men<br> painting his windows.<br> Any brave man would resist.<br> I'm sorry for this.<br> No harm.<br> In future you will not<br> be molested again.<br> If you or your friends<br> ever need help...<br> Who did that?<br> One of my friends.<br> Hynkel's palace was the centre<br> of the world's<br> greatest war machine.<br> Behind it<br> was the dynamic Adenoid Hynkel,<br> whose genius ran the nation,<br> whose ceaseless activity kept him<br> occupied every moment of the day.<br> Marshal Herring is waiting.<br> Enough!<br> I believe we've got something now.<br> A bulletproof uniform.<br> The material is as light as silk.<br> Where?<br> I've arranged for a demonstration.<br> It will only take two minutes.<br> I can spare one.<br> Professor Herr Kibitzen.<br> Actions speak louder than words.<br> A bulletproof uniform.<br> One hundred percent perfect.<br> Shoot!<br> Far from perfect.<br> - Where's my secretary?<br> - In the outer office.<br> Call her.<br> Take a letter.<br> Herring here in the tower room.<br> We've got something marvellous.<br> I shall be up.<br> A parachute.<br> The most compact in the world.<br> Worn like a hat.<br> It will open in 25 feet.<br> Demonstrate, professor.<br> Herring,<br> why do you waste my time like this?<br> Send Garbitsch here.<br> Herr Garbitsch is waiting.<br> Enough!<br> What's the meaning of this?<br> We need to manufacture munitions.<br> - We've made a few arrests.<br> - How many?<br> Five or ten thousand...<br> a day.<br> - A day?<br> - Just a few dissenters.<br> Dissenting about?<br> Working hours, wage cuts,<br> the synthetic food, the quality<br> of the sawdust in the bread.<br> What more do they want?<br> It's from the finest lumber!<br> Nevertheless, the people<br> are overworked. They need diversion.<br> The people, bah!<br> We might go further with the Jews.<br> Burn some of their houses.<br> An assault on the ghetto.<br> Something more dramatic. When can<br> we be ready to invade Osterlich?<br> Three months.<br> I can't wait.<br> Napaloni's army might invade first.<br> We must strike now.<br> We'll require foreign capital.<br> Borrow it!<br> The bankers have refused.<br> One man<br> might make us a loan: Epstein.<br> - Epstein? He's a Jew, isn't he?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, let's be big about it.<br> We'll borrow from Epstein.<br> It might be difficult in view<br> of our policy towards his people.<br> Then we'll change our policy.<br> Tell Schultz all persecution<br> of the Jews must cease.<br> At least<br> till we've negotiated this loan.<br> I don't understand it.<br> The whole ghetto is so quiet.<br> You can't imagine<br> what was going on.<br> This Hynkel business.<br> You weren't here, you were<br> in the hospital, unconscious.<br> You don't appreciate<br> what a good time you were having.<br> If things get worse<br> we can go to Osterlich.<br> That's still free.<br> Sooner or later we'll have to go.<br> Anyway, it's nice to see you back.<br> It's like the old days again, eh?<br> How's business?<br> Very slow.<br> The men are in concentration camp.<br> You should fix up the women.<br> The beauty parlour business.<br> Know anything about it?<br> You can learn.<br> You can practise on Hannah.<br> Hannah, get in that chair,<br> we'll make you look beautiful.<br> What for?<br> He's going to practise on you.<br> Not with mud on my face?<br> No, we'll take some off.<br> Make me look beautiful?<br> Sure.<br> He can't make you look any worse!<br> Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry!<br> I'll give it to her.<br> You sit here and enjoy yourself.<br> I know.<br> I've seen you making eyes.<br> Don't pay any attention to him.<br> I like your shop<br> since it's fixed up.<br> I wish I had a business like this.<br> There's no future in housework.<br> Maybe if I save my money<br> I can have a barbershop some day.<br> But I can never save.<br> Money slips through my fingers.<br> I've always lived<br> up to every penny I've earned.<br> Why shouldn't I?

They do not fulfil<br> that promise. They never will!<br> Dictators free themselves<br> but they enslave the people.<br> Now let us fight<br> to fulfil that promise!<br> Let us fight to free the world,<br> to do away with national barriers,<br> to do away with greed,<br> with hate and intolerance.<br> Let us fight for a world of reason,<br> a world where science and progress<br> will lead to the happiness of all.<br> Soldiers, in the name of democracy,<br> let us unite!<br> Hannah,<br> can you hear me?<br> Wherever you are, look up, Hannah.<br> The clouds are lifting,<br> the sun is breaking through.<br> We are coming out of the darkness<br> into a new world,<br> a kindlier world,<br> where men will rise<br> above their hate, their greed<br> and their brutality.<br> Look up, Hannah.<br> The soul of man<br> has been given wings.<br> He is flying into the rainbow,<br> into the light of hope,<br> into the future,<br> the glorious future<br> that belongs to you,<br> to me and to all of us.<br> Look up, Hannah.
