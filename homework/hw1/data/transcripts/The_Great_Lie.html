                        Dirty pigs.<br> Expecting me to clear up this mess.<br> Heh. Fourteen dollars a week.<br> Poor devils. I don't suppose<br> they'll get up today too.<br> I don't know where to start in this place.<br> Oh, well, I suppose I'd better<br> get back to this. I'll get these cleaned up.<br> They're both asleep.<br> - They are?<br> - A nice-looking place this is, isn't it?<br> - Still a party?<br> - Till dawn.<br> They've made a madhouse of this apartment<br> since they were married.<br> Oh, but I have to know<br> about Philadelphia.<br> I'm going to see her.<br> I've got to know.<br> I've got know.<br> She told the reporters she was going on<br> with her career.<br> Shh.<br> Shh, shh.<br> You're the husband.<br> Guilty.<br> Do you realize that Madam Kovak is due<br> to play with the Philadelphia Symphony...<br> ...on Tuesday?<br> - Yes. The piano.<br> Mr. Van Allen,<br> your lawyer called three times.<br> - He wants to see you. It's important.<br> - Thank you.<br> - He called yesterday.<br> - Why didn't you tell me?<br> - I did.<br> - You did?<br> - You were saying something, sir?<br> - I am madam's manager.<br> She's due in Philadelphia, Tuesday.<br> House is sold out.<br> - I've got to know.<br> - Well, you sit right down here now.<br> I know little about madam's musical talent.<br> I just married the lady.<br> Oh, an artist like Madam Kovak<br> should be married in a cathedral.<br> A wedding of importance.<br> Everything she does is of importance.<br> Instead of which she runs away<br> like a chorus girl.<br> Yeah. It was all very impulsive,<br> wasn't it?<br> - Would you like a drink?<br> - No.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - No.<br> Morning paper? Maybe a sedative<br> to cool you off and quiet you down.<br> - No.<br> - Would you like a glass of milk?<br> Well, what do you want?<br> There's only one thing I want.<br> Madam Kovak.<br> I've got to see Madam Kovak<br> and I'm going to wait until I do.<br> Well, sleep tight.<br> The house is yours.<br> What's that...?<br> What's that peculiar smell around here?<br> Fresh air. I've just opened the window.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Skoal?<br> - Hello, Jock.<br> - Hello.<br> - How's the lawyer?<br> - How's the bridegroom?<br> Oh.<br> Not so good.<br> Say, you could've told a friend, who's your<br> lawyer, that you intended to marry Sandra.<br> - You looked on the wine, I take it.<br> - You may take it. I did.<br> You haven't been out in daylight<br> for a week.<br> Well, there's something<br> about that woman.<br> There must be.<br> She's a great pianist, a great beauty.<br> But after all, marriage is a step.<br> - It's a leap.<br> - In the dark.<br> Well, it's morning now.<br> Seriously, Pete.<br> Are you going through with this?<br> - Well, we're married.<br> - That's just it.<br> - What?<br> - You're not.<br> - What do you mean we're not married?<br> - Sandra's divorce wasn't final.<br> Well, don't be silly. She gave that party<br> to celebrate her final divorce.<br> - You climaxed the party by getting married.<br> - That's what they told me when I woke up.<br> Look, Pete, her divorce decree<br> cannot be entered until next Tuesday.<br> - The lady got her dates mixed.<br> - You mean, we're not really married?<br> Not unless you do it again.<br> If you wanna go through with this thing,<br> you'll have to marry her soberly and legally.<br> Oh.<br> It will all be arranged very simply for you<br> to be married by a judge, if you want to.<br> Come out and have lunch<br> and we'll talk it over.<br> Oh, no.<br> No. Uh...<br> What I need is some nice,<br> clean fresh air.<br> I know where I can get it.<br> - You'd better pull yourself together, Pete.<br> - Don't worry. I will. Thanks very much.<br> So long, Pete.<br> Mr. Pete.<br> Violet, Violet.<br> What is it?<br> It's Mr. Pete, flying down from the sky<br> like an angel of the Lord.<br> Hush your mouth.<br> Don't go calling that man's name.<br> He ain't coming here no more.<br> He's on his honeymoon, he is.<br> How are you, Mr. Pete?<br> Hello, Jefferson.<br> - Been raining?<br> - Yes, sir. Been pouring down.<br> - Where's Miss Maggie?<br> - Violet's right in there.<br> She's the one that knows<br> about Miss Maggie's whereabouts.<br> Man, did you see that old airplane<br> come a-raring and a-snorting?<br> Man, I sure did.<br> Hello, Violet.<br> No use using that whistle, Mr. Pete.<br> That sound belongs to the days<br> that is gone.<br> Where's Miss Maggie?<br> Mr. Pete, if you take my advice,<br> you'll get right back in that airplane...<br> ...and fly away like a bird<br> right back where you come from.<br> I've just arrived and I wanna<br> see Miss Maggie. Where is she?<br> Mr. Pete, if you take my advice,<br> you'll get right back in that airplane and...<br> Now, nobody ain't gonna use<br> no force, Mr. Pete.<br> If your conscience don't keep you<br> from going up, your good manners should.<br> Just think, Mr. Pete.<br> I have been thinking.<br> The whole of the morning.<br> We has had our thoughts too.<br> And they ain't been very good company.<br> Violet.<br> Yes, Miss Maggie.<br> Your name ain't Violet, Mr. Pete.<br> My goodness, honey child.<br> Lay down before you catch more cold.<br> Is he drinking?<br> What do you care if he's drinking<br> or if he ain't?<br> Tell him I'm busy and I've got a cold.<br> - Are you taking your medicine?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm much better.<br> I don't wanna see him anyway.<br> That's what I told him<br> but I'll tell him again.<br> You go down and be nice<br> and polite now.<br> Tell him I've got a cold,<br> that I'm busy and that I...<br> I can't see him, can I?<br> No, Miss Maggie. You can't.<br> Well?<br> Why not?<br> Don't ask me the reason why not.<br> Just tell me the reason why.<br> She's got a bad cold, Miss Maggie has.<br> How did she catch it?<br> Walking in the rain alone.<br> Then coming home soaking wet<br> and sitting down thinking...<br> ...and forgetting she's wet.<br> Thinking so hard about someone<br> or something.<br> Oh, I see.<br> We sees too, Mr. Pete.<br> We sees the papers.<br> It's a fine thing when you read news<br> about your friends in the papers.<br> Well, I'm sorry.<br> Miss Maggie would never tell you,<br> not till Judgment Day, what you done to her.<br> But I knows and you knows, Mr. Pete,<br> there's only one thing to do now...<br> ...and that's to go away<br> and stay away, Mr. Pete.<br> You get right back in that airplane<br> and fly away.<br> Pete.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> What's the matter with me?<br> Oh, you got a cold.<br> - Yes.<br> - What are you taking for it?<br> None of your business.<br> - Well, how did you get it?<br> - I got wet.<br> You didn't have sense enough<br> to come in out of the rain.<br> - If I had any sense. If I had any sense...<br> - I wouldn't be in your life.<br> No, you wouldn't.<br> Just like this cold,<br> a sneeze or two and you'd be gone.<br> Your nose is pink. Your eyes are red.<br> And violets are blue<br> and sugar is sweet and I wish you'd go.<br> I only asked you to come up...<br> ...because I didn't want you to think<br> I was afraid to see you.<br> Like a little child hiding in her room.<br> Hey.<br> - What?<br> - Sit down.<br> Look at that. Without your shoes on.<br> - What are you doing here anyway?<br> - I wanna talk to you.<br> You wanna talk to me?<br> You act as if nothing had happened.<br> Well, among other things, I...<br> I'm thinking about going back<br> into aviation.<br> You know, there's a lot doing now.<br> Hemisphere defense and all that stuff.<br> - Whose idea is this?<br> - Yours.<br> Don't you remember?<br> The day after New Year's.<br> There was snow and we skated and...<br> Yeah, and I proposed.<br> And I refused.<br> Oh, Pete, let's not go into this<br> all over again.<br> You see, the unfortunate thing for me<br> is that...<br> And I'm not whining.<br> - It's been like this for four years.<br> On and off and off and on.<br> Well, there was only one thing<br> I ever asked you.<br> One thing I begged you to do.<br> To be a sober, solid citizen.<br> Well, sober anyway.<br> But I guess the prospect<br> was too dull for you.<br> Well, now it's all over...<br> ...and I feel the way I did<br> when they took the bands off my teeth.<br> And I had those blasted things<br> for four years too.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Tell me honestly,<br> is this marriage of yours going to help?<br> If I thought it would, I'd be so for it.<br> Well, you know Sandra.<br> Yes, I do.<br> You like her?<br> I hate her.<br> Oh, not because you're married to her, Pete,<br> but you know.<br> Well, I won't talk about her.<br> The fact remains that whatever she was<br> or is...<br> ...she is your wife<br> and I can't discuss her.<br> - Maggie, let me...<br> - Oh, Violet was right.<br> You shouldn't have come<br> and I shouldn't have seen you.<br> I wonder what you think of me, really.<br> You know what I think of you.<br> You think of me as you would<br> a nagging, haggling wife, and I'm not.<br> I'm young. I like to drink and dance<br> and go to parties...<br> ...like other people do?<br> Every time I see you, I feel like<br> your little old gray-haired mother...<br> ...with the roses over the door<br> and the lamp in the window.<br> Well, the lamp's out.<br> That's not true.<br> Anyway, I'm tired of being your...<br> Your haven.<br> - Did your wife know you came down here?<br> - No.<br> Don't you think it would've been nicer<br> if you'd told her?<br> Yes, but she was asleep.<br> Besides, I wanted some fresh air...<br> ...and I wanted to talk to you<br> about something.<br> Aviation.<br> No, but...<br> Well, we all make blunders.<br> Have you come behind her back in the first<br> week to tell me that you've blundered?<br> - No.<br> - Then what did you come here to tell me?<br> Oh.<br> I don't know.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Come in.<br> Excuse me, Miss Maggie,<br> I just had to come up.<br> - Mr. Pete, you is bad for us around here.<br> - Violet.<br> Your lady wife must be waiting<br> for you now.<br> I'm sure your intentions are of the best,<br> but this is a personal matter.<br> There's nothing personal between Maggie<br> that ain't personal with me.<br> - Why, since she's that big, I've always...<br> - Violet, please.<br> Pete, you'd better go.<br> Perhaps I'd better.<br> I did tell you about that aviation thing,<br> didn't I?<br> - Yes. Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Sorry, Violet.<br> Please, Violet. Stop, please.<br> - Are you still here?<br> - Yes.<br> Did you see her?<br> No, and I'm not leaving till I do.<br> She sent word<br> she would wait till you got back...<br> ...and then talk it over with you.<br> It's a crime.<br> Those are her new records out today.<br> The woman's a sensation.<br> And this concert waiting for her<br> with the Philadelphia Symphony.<br> How would you like a little drink?<br> Cigarette? Glass of milk?<br> No, I want Madam Kovak.<br> - Oh, that's where I came in.<br> No.<br> - What's that?<br> - Oh, that's been going on for a long time.<br> No.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - You opened the window this morning...<br> ...and I caught cold in my shoulder.<br> Do I get a kiss or don't I?<br> We've been talking<br> and he agrees with me.<br> That's nice.<br> About going on with my work.<br> After all these years of working,<br> it'd be silly to give it up.<br> Of course, he's right.<br> My name is Peter Van Allen.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.<br> Oh!<br> Get out. You hurt.<br> Pardon, madam.<br> This is Worthington James.<br> Oscar.<br> Well, how do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> Oh, Petie, ring the bell.<br> I don't think I've ever had such a headache<br> in my life.<br> Pay that little man.<br> I think he's made it worse. Bertha.<br> Bertha, I want a cup of black coffee<br> with brandy in it.<br> Do you think that'd be best?<br> Would you like one?<br> - No, dear.<br> - No?<br> No.<br> Worthy James waited to meet you.<br> He's one of my oldest and best friends.<br> He gave me the money for my first real<br> piano lessons here in New York with Vannez.<br> How old was I then, Worthy?<br> Too young.<br> How do you like my Pete<br> now that you've seen him?<br> Very good.<br> Go get a drink, Petie. You look sad.<br> You failed me. I expected you to come in<br> with something to say.<br> Something amusing.<br> He's a gay lad, really.<br> I'm sure of it.<br> Oh, Pete, go and tell poor old Joshua<br> I'll call him up in an hour.<br> I want to talk to you first.<br> Go along now.<br> Well, I must be hopping.<br> Oh, don't hop yet, Worthy.<br> Stick around a bit.<br> - Would you like cheese or some port?<br> - No.<br> - What about Philadelphia?<br> - She'll call you in an hour.<br> - I guarantee it.<br> - Thanks. I'll be at home waiting.<br> - I'll show you out.<br> - No, don't bother.<br> - Goodbye, old man.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Bertha.<br> Come here.<br> Take this tray away.<br> I hate the smell of food.<br> - Don't look like that. Are you angry?<br> - No.<br> Worthy James has been like a father<br> to me.<br> Oh, why, I haven't a jealous emotion<br> in me.<br> I could take that two ways.<br> Where were you today?<br> You didn't even call.<br> Oh, I went down to see my good lawyer,<br> Jock...<br> ...then I flew down to Maryland.<br> - Whatever for?<br> - Fresh air.<br> - Did you get it?<br> - What?<br> The air.<br> Well, what would you like to do?<br> Do you feel like kissing me?<br> Oh, Pete.<br> You've got to be patient with me, Pete.<br> I've been a bachelor so long.<br> So have you, for that matter.<br> I should have been a dutiful wife...<br> ...and whipped up a little home dinner<br> for you today.<br> You know, one of the most attractive things<br> about you to me...<br> ...has always been<br> that you understood women.<br> Now, you're going to try<br> and understand me, aren't you?<br> I wonder if you could ease up<br> on this party life of yours.<br> You know,<br> come away someplace quietly.<br> Some golf and some walks<br> and some fresh air.<br> Golf? Walks? Me?<br> Pete, this is a side of you<br> I've never seen.<br> By the way, I haven't told you.<br> We'll have to do it again.<br> - What?<br> - Get married.<br> - Are you kidding?<br> - No.<br> I'll have to propose<br> and you'll have to say yes...<br> ...and then we can be married again.<br> That's what Jock wanted<br> to see me about today.<br> But I don't see what was wrong.<br> Well, it seems your divorce from Mr. Stokes<br> will not be final until next Tuesday.<br> Ridiculous.<br> It was final when I married you.<br> I'm afraid you're mistaken.<br> The decree can't be entered<br> until next Tuesday.<br> - You had your dates mixed.<br> - Dates bore me.<br> Then we're not actually married.<br> That's it.<br> Did you tell someone in Maryland all this?<br> She must have been very amused.<br> And if there's one thing I adore,<br> it's being laughed at. And by a woman.<br> Of course I haven't told anyone.<br> Well, are you gonna propose<br> to me again?<br> I think we should sit down<br> and talk this thing out...<br> ...and see where we're going.<br> Then we can be married next Tuesday.<br> - I'll be playing in Philadelphia.<br> - Put it off.<br> Is there a doubt in your mind<br> that we could make a go of this?<br> Well, I'm asking you to marry me.<br> You were much more amusing<br> the first time.<br> I'm sober now.<br> Well, suppose you go out<br> and get yourself into another mood?<br> All right.<br> Pete.<br> When are you coming back?<br> - Next Tuesday.<br> - I'll be in Philadelphia.<br> That's the day we're going to be married.<br> I have asked you to marry me<br> on Tuesday.<br> I've already told you I won't be here.<br> Then don't go to Philadelphia.<br> - Is that Miss Kovak's room?<br> - In there, ma'am.<br> Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.<br> Bravo.<br> - Here you are.<br> - It's so warm.<br> I'll get your wrap.<br> You were magnificent.<br> Bravo. Bravo.<br> - Hello. How are you?<br> Oh, darling, you were never better.<br> - Darling.<br> How are you?<br> Let's have some food.<br> I've never known you<br> when you played so magnificently.<br> Sweet of you to come. I'd have come to you,<br> but I'm catching the New York plane.<br> What happened to that young man<br> you ran away with?<br> - What? Oh, hello. Come in.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> He's still running.<br> I've only paused for breath.<br> If that's Peter Van Allen I know,<br> don't let him get out of your sight.<br> You might have let us know.<br> We were in New York.<br> Well, I'm afraid that party was a little wild,<br> even for you and Harry.<br> Excuse me just a moment.<br> - Hello, Maggie.<br> - Hello.<br> - Weren't you out front at all?<br> - No, I just got in at 10:15.<br> Oh, and you came right back to see me.<br> How sweet.<br> Where's Pete?<br> - In New York.<br> - Oh.<br> Did you come to see him?<br> I came to see you both.<br> I thought he'd be here, naturally.<br> How did you know I was playing here?<br> - Called your apartment in New York.<br> - Was Pete there?<br> No, there wasn't any answer<br> so I talked to the porter downstairs.<br> Oh.<br> - You see, I was calling from Washington.<br> - Oh.<br> Well, would you like me<br> to give a message to Pete for you?<br> Yes.<br> Let's go into my dressing room<br> for a moment.<br> Sit down, Maggie.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - No, thank you. I've just had one.<br> Sweating like a stoker.<br> Well, don't catch cold. I'm just over one.<br> - May I bring you anything?<br> No, thank you.<br> Pete left the window open while I was<br> in bed and I caught cold in my shoulder.<br> I didn't play very well tonight.<br> I'm sure he did it on purpose.<br> One thing, there's never a dull moment<br> with Pete.<br> Tell me, did you find him stubborn?<br> When?<br> Well, you were engaged to him twice,<br> weren't you?<br> Yes.<br> You're looking very well<br> under the circumstances.<br> What circumstances?<br> You said you had a cold.<br> Oh, yes, but I said I was over it.<br> The cold?<br> Definitely.<br> Good for you.<br> Now, what is it you want me<br> to tell Pete?<br> It's an idea I've had for him<br> for a long time.<br> If you write it, I promise not to open the<br> letter if you mark it "Personal from Maggie. "<br> I went to Washington<br> to see my Uncle Ted.<br> After Pete told me he was going<br> to offer himself to the government.<br> What for? Income tax?<br> Aviation.<br> Didn't he tell you his plans?<br> Not about flying for the government, no.<br> No, I'm going to keep Pete<br> on the ground.<br> What is this scheme?<br> Pete is an expert at maps<br> and navigation.<br> He was made a Fellow of the Royal<br> Geographical Society in England.<br> Oh, he has a natural instinct for it.<br> And that coupled with his flying...<br> ...makes him the kind of man<br> the government's gonna need.<br> Uncle Ted said all he'd have to do would be<br> to apply for a job.<br> Well, that's very kind of you, Maggie.<br> But I like Pete where he is and as he is.<br> Well, he's your husband.<br> Yes, he is.<br> Supposing you go.<br> I came...<br> - It was just a thought.<br> - Oh, and a very sweet one.<br> If I didn't think you meant so well,<br> I'd feel like slapping your face.<br> On that one point, Sandra,<br> we deeply understand each other.<br> - Don't miss your little train, Maggie.<br> - I won't.<br> I want to make a party-to-party call.<br> What?<br> Person-to-person call then.<br> Mr. Peter Van Allen.<br> V- A-N A-L-L-E-N. In New York.<br> Gramercy, 550264.<br> If he's not there, try the Racquet Club.<br> If he's not there, try the Yale Club.<br> Find him.<br> His wife, Mrs. Van Allen, is calling.<br> Hurry it up.<br> - Jefferson, whose car is that?<br> - Mr. Pete's.<br> - When did he come?<br> - This morning.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> Violet promised me she'd sweep him<br> out of the house with the trash...<br> ...while I was getting you<br> from the station.<br> But why didn't you tell me?<br> Well, we wasn't gonna say anything<br> if Violet done got him cleared out.<br> You done had all the botheration<br> you can stand.<br> I heard a roar like thunder and in come<br> this machine a-flying through the gate.<br> It done tore down part of the gate.<br> Slammed on the brakes and might've<br> thrown itself through the window.<br> Miss Maggie.<br> - Yes?<br> We tried every means at our disposal...<br> ...outside of witchcraft,<br> to get him out of the house.<br> But he wasn't in no moving mood.<br> I do think you have your nerve.<br> - Now, hold your horses.<br> I will not. This isn't a roadhouse...<br> ...that you can drop in and out of.<br> I don't want you here. Go to your wife.<br> - Don't be a fool.<br> - Don't touch me.<br> Let's not brawl.<br> At least listen to what I have to say.<br> Supposing you go.<br> A prisoner has a chance to speak<br> before he's sentenced.<br> - You sound like a book, a cheap one.<br> - I thought the line was a good simile for me.<br> All right, laugh.<br> Supposing I admit I haven't had<br> a particularly happy time lately.<br> It's been a shock.<br> I did love you more than anything else<br> in the world and it does hurt.<br> Now, what could you say<br> that would alter that? What?<br> Do you suppose I'd come here<br> if I didn't have something to say?<br> - Definitely bearing on what you've just said.<br> - No, but what about your wife?<br> Sandra?<br> Well, Sandra was not properly divorced<br> from my predecessor, Mr. Stokes...<br> ...when it was thought<br> that we were married.<br> The necessity<br> for a second marriage ceremony...<br> ...was explained to me by my lawyer,<br> Jock Thompson, last Wednesday...<br> ...when I came here to see you.<br> But you didn't tell me that.<br> I should liked to have told you,<br> but I had a clear duty ahead of me.<br> I returned and explained the situation<br> to Sandra.<br> I asked her to marry me<br> when her divorce papers were final.<br> That was yesterday, Tuesday.<br> But she preferred to go to Philadelphia<br> and perform on her piano.<br> So I waited in New York until midnight.<br> And then by every stroke<br> of my conscience, I was free.<br> So I came down here to tell you about it.<br> I've always told you everything<br> about myself, haven't I?<br> Give me a cigarette.<br> Oh.<br> I've got a funny feeling<br> in the pit of my stomach.<br> This room is full of ghosts. I haven't been<br> in this part of the house in years.<br> Yes, you know, we're going to have to<br> do something about this room.<br> Violet...<br> ...lunch.<br> Ham, cakes, honey and coffee.<br> Jefferson.<br> - Jefferson. Jefferson.<br> Ho.<br> You go right out and get that peanut-fed<br> hickory-smoked, sweet Virginia ham.<br> You ain't gonna feed that man, is you?<br> Listen, Jefferson.<br> I'd feed the devil himself...<br> ...if he'd polish up the smile<br> on Miss Maggie's face like that.<br> Violet, you better practice ducking.<br> Ducking, what for?<br> When that high-toned New York lady<br> what he done married...<br> ...comes stomping here with that gun...<br> - Gun?<br> There's gonna be shooting here<br> and shooting there.<br> No dog's gonna be safe.<br> I ain't gonna<br> have nothing to do with it myself.<br> I ain't worried now.<br> Steady, Jefferson, here we go.<br> I'm steadying.<br> Nice music.<br> Yes.<br> Must be something very special<br> going on around here.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, a wedding.<br> - Oh, friends of yours?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> I've known them both for years.<br> Personally, I'm glad the suspense is over.<br> They've been messing about at<br> getting married ever since I can remember.<br> - Fools.<br> - Yes.<br> Was it a nice wedding?<br> The usual thing: "Do you? I do. "<br> Kiss the bride. Have some cake.<br> - That's a good idea.<br> - What?<br> Kiss the bride.<br> Why do I love you?<br> Because I am so beautiful.<br> You know,<br> you are a funny-looking little thing.<br> - What?<br> - But I do like your face.<br> And that crooked little tooth<br> when you smile.<br> - And your hair.<br> - What's the matter with my hair?<br> That cowlick. You couldn't even fix it<br> for your wedding, could you?<br> Ouch!<br> I can hear your heart.<br> It's beating so fast.<br> Don't be silly.<br> That's my watch.<br> It's still beating.<br> Well, it's getting late.<br> I really should be on my way,<br> you know.<br> Dear. So should I.<br> I'm on my honeymoon.<br> So you are. Yes.<br> - Having a lovely time?<br> - Lovely, so far.<br> All right.<br> - Maggie.<br> - What?<br> You've shrunk.<br> Oh, I forgot.<br> Maggie Patterson,<br> are you still doing that?<br> - Well, they hurt.<br> - Well, then sit down.<br> Do you remember the first time<br> I met you?<br> Mm-hm. At a football game.<br> Yes, you had lost your shoes.<br> And you had to carry me out.<br> Yup. And when you clutched me<br> around the neck, I said:<br> "Pete, old boy, you're hooked. "<br> And Pete, old boy, you are.<br> Pete.<br> Pete, no.<br> All right, I won't argue with you.<br> You can make the house white.<br> - The trees white, the dogs white.<br> - I'll paint you white if...<br> Darling, now listen. Mr. Talbot's waiting.<br> He's a very busy man.<br> I think we should start in this room<br> in here, don't you?<br> You know, Papa preferred this room<br> to his own study.<br> Well, we can redo the ceiling.<br> That was his chair.<br> He even let the dogs sit here.<br> And lots of mint juleps if I remember.<br> - Oh, yes, nice big ones.<br> - He was a tough old gentleman, your father.<br> - Yes, he was.<br> - Yeah.<br> And I can be tough too.<br> - What about, for instance?<br> - About you.<br> - Oh, I don't believe...<br> Oh, Pete, stop it.<br> Here's Violet.<br> What's this, Violet?<br> A letter for Mrs. Van Allen.<br> I signed for it.<br> Washington.<br> Anything bad?<br> He has to go to Washington at once.<br> And you just married five days?<br> I'd just let that letter blow away<br> in the wind.<br> Violet.<br> - Yes, Mr. Pete?<br> - Take off the covers in the other room.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - How about curtains?<br> - Curtains?<br> I think some nice bright chintz.<br> You know, brighten the whole room up.<br> Hey...<br> ...that letter for me?<br> Oh, no. It's for me, from Uncle Ted.<br> Oh.<br> - Venetian blinds?<br> - Huh?<br> - Venetian blinds?<br> - Oh, Venetian blinds?<br> Yeah. Well, why don't you just...?<br> You're an expert, you know?<br> You do the whole thing<br> and let me know tomorrow.<br> - All right.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hey.<br> Talbot's gonna take a look around<br> and bring some estimates tomorrow.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Nothing.<br> Oh, yes, there is.<br> - Anything in that letter?<br> - No.<br> - Let me see it.<br> - No, I won't let you.<br> You will let me see because<br> I'll get it anyway. Give me that.<br> All right.<br> I would have had to tell you anyway.<br> It's from Washington<br> and they want you to leave at once.<br> Really? Let me see it.<br> Uncle Ted says, "If Peter is serious...<br> ...I strongly advise that he lose no time<br> in coming here. "<br> Then he goes on to say that Aunt Ada<br> is in New York now and...<br> I have an idea. You fly to Washington.<br> And I'll go on to New York,<br> stay with Aunt Ada.<br> You see your man in Washington,<br> come to New York and we'll have a spree.<br> - What do you say?<br> - Why, that's great.<br> You were going to lie to me.<br> You were gonna hold out on me.<br> With those innocent little eyes of yours.<br> Darling, I know you must go,<br> but I hate it.<br> Now, now.<br> We made a bargain, didn't we?<br> Maggie, you smell of hay and horses<br> and sunshine.<br> Gee, what lovely kids<br> you're going to have.<br> Yes, hello. Oh, yes, yes, yes.<br> Yes, I understand.<br> Oh, operator, when the long-distance call<br> comes through for Mrs. Van Allen...<br> ...she's in the Palm Lounge.<br> Mr. James.<br> Hey, Emile.<br> Where is Mrs. Van Allen?<br> Oh, Mrs. Van Allen? Oh, yes, madam.<br> She's there.<br> Say, where are you going, dear?<br> It's Maggie. I must congratulate her.<br> Order me...<br> ...a double.<br> Hello, Sandra.<br> Congratulations.<br> Thank you.<br> Where is Pete?<br> Washington.<br> - So you did get him into the air.<br> - Yes.<br> Maggie, I'm giving you fair warning.<br> I'm going to get him back.<br> Pete's married to me now, Sandra.<br> There wasn't any flaw in that ceremony,<br> was there, Maggie?<br> You'd see to that, wouldn't you?<br> Do we have to go on with this?<br> I've canceled my Australian tour.<br> Really?<br> Maggie, I'm going to have a baby.<br> - Pete's?<br> - Yes.<br> But you wouldn't. You couldn't.<br> - You're wrong, Maggie. I can and I will.<br> Mrs. Van Allen, please.<br> - Yes.<br> Your long-distance call, ma'am.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> I'm talking from your Uncle Ted's house.<br> Hello, darling. Hold on, will you?<br> I'll go upstairs.<br> No, there isn't time.<br> I said, I haven't time.<br> I'm leaving on a trip immediately.<br> - Well, yes, dear, I know it's a shock but...<br> - Well, I'm down in the bar.<br> I can't hear anything.<br> Let me go upstairs, will you? What?<br> You did? How long?<br> - Well, that's very quick, isn't it?<br> - It was sheer luck.<br> You had the right hunch.<br> If I'd been a day later, I'd have missed it.<br> Your Uncle Ted<br> will explain everything to you.<br> Yes, he wants you to come back here<br> with your Aunt Ada.<br> And stay here until I return.<br> Well, do you know for how long?<br> Oh, you don't? I see.<br> Tell him I'm with you.<br> Well...<br> Well, darling, goodbye<br> and take good care of yourself.<br> Goodbye, my darling.<br> There's a kiss. Did you hear it?<br> Well, send one back.<br> Aren't you pleased?<br> Oh, yes, of course I'm pleased.<br> Goodbye, Pete.<br> Goodbye.<br> Pete going away?<br> You're going to lose him, Maggie.<br> I'm going to get him back.<br> Time will take care of that.<br> I told you I'm going to have a child.<br> You're lying.<br> Time will take care of that.<br> Ask Mrs. Greenfield<br> if she will come into the study.<br> Yes, sir.<br> The senator said he would like to see you<br> in the study, ma'am.<br> - What for? Who's with him?<br> - Colonel Harriston.<br> Colonel Harriston.<br> I'd love to meet him, Aunt Ada.<br> You will, dear. We'll have him in to tea.<br> What is it?<br> Oh, how do you do, Colonel Harriston?<br> Mrs. Greenfield.<br> The plane's missing.<br> Peter Van Allen?<br> Oh, that poor girl.<br> - Maggie.<br> Yes.<br> Come here, dear.<br> Yes, Aunt Ada.<br> Come into the study.<br> Hello, uncle.<br> This is Colonel Harriston.<br> - Not the Colonel Harriston?<br> - Mrs. Van Allen.<br> How do you do?<br> Maggie, we've had some news about Pete<br> and his party.<br> It's not altogether hopeless but...<br> Colonel.<br> They've been missing for 24 hours<br> over the Brazilian jungle.<br> Brazilian jungle? Missing?<br> Yes. The terrain is a little difficult.<br> It takes some time to get a searching party<br> and their planes back over there.<br> It's very rough, and none of them<br> have been able to make a landing yet.<br> And the weather wasn't any too good.<br> They were on their way back.<br> Actually, they were due last night.<br> Of course, we don't know.<br> I wouldn't say<br> that it was hopeless but...<br> Did you say you had sent<br> a searching party out for him?<br> Yes. As far as we know,<br> the only point they could land...<br> ...is 40 miles from where they last heard<br> from the plane.<br> The country's very thick<br> and it may take a little time.<br> Yes, I see.<br> But they're all experienced men.<br> Brady, who's with them, knows the country<br> as well as it's possible to know it.<br> I'm very sorry, Mrs. Van Allen.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> It's not hopeless.<br> Mr. And Mrs. Latan...<br> ...and Madam and Miss Rosinni<br> are in the drawing room.<br> Very well. I suppose this is still secret.<br> Yes, I was going to point that out.<br> Oh, I understand.<br> Come, darling.<br> - Doesn't look very good, does it?<br> - No, it doesn't.<br> Jefferson.<br> You go up<br> and see what Miss Maggie wants.<br> I just can't stand to look at her face.<br> Who is that gentleman upstairs<br> with Miss Maggie?<br> That gentleman is from New York.<br> That's Mr. Pete's lawyer, that is.<br> It's so hard to believe...<br> ...so hard to understand.<br> I know, Maggie, but you've got to think<br> of yourself, some sleep, some food.<br> What for? There's nothing.<br> I really don't care.<br> There's nothing.<br> All these weeks he's been missing,<br> I've kept hearing him come over here...<br> ...with that silly little plane...<br> ...and his signal going,<br> brup, brup, brup.<br> - I really heard him this morning.<br> - What?<br> Of course it was only Jefferson<br> and his lawn mower.<br> There was no one else like him alive.<br> Do you remember<br> those ridiculous sketches...<br> ...and that silly old whistle and?<br> - But you know him very well, didn't you?<br> - Oh, yes. School, college, his lawyer.<br> I knew Pete.<br> - You've got to forgive me.<br> - Oh, of course, my dear.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Jefferson, um, Mr. Thompson will stay<br> for lunch.<br> - Yes, Miss Maggie.<br> - Will you have a drink?<br> If you'll have one, it might be good.<br> - Bring Mr. Thompson a mint julep, will you?<br> - Yes.<br> And, Jefferson, don't you and Violet<br> go around looking like that.<br> Mr. Pete's just gone, that's all.<br> Yes'm, just gone.<br> Yes, Miss Maggie.<br> Nice people.<br> Oh, yes.<br> They both loved Pete very much.<br> Everyone did.<br> Oh, by the way, Sandra called me<br> at 4:00 this morning.<br> Somebody saw it in the early editions<br> and called her.<br> She's out of her mind.<br> Is she?<br> There is a satisfaction in knowing<br> when he went out...<br> ...he was doing something worthwhile.<br> - Oh, I know, I've thought of that.<br> I've thought of everything<br> that would make it easier.<br> - But, you see, I made him do it.<br> - He was a very happy man, Maggie.<br> He was very happy to go on that trip.<br> He called me from Washington<br> the day he left.<br> He called himself "the big family man. "<br> He wanted children.<br> Yes, I know he did.<br> That would have been something,<br> wouldn't it?<br> What?<br> Something of his.<br> To live on.<br> - Yes.<br> - Oh, if I could only scream or something.<br> Maggie. Maggie.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Oh.<br> This...<br> This letter registered special<br> came from Sandra.<br> - For you?<br> - No, it's for Pete.<br> Oh, well, I'll send it back to her.<br> It seems like a very long letter.<br> I think I'll go to New York with you.<br> I was going to suggest you didn't stay<br> down here alone.<br> Yes.<br> - Jock, let's leave right away.<br> - All right.<br> I'll hurry.<br> Miss Kovak?<br> She's not at home.<br> May I wait?<br> It won't do any good.<br> Could I leave her a note?<br> Well, you may.<br> Have you a piece of paper and pencil?<br> Yes, miss.<br> Thank you.<br> Who was it, Bertha?<br> I must speak to you.<br> Were you lying when you told me you might<br> be going to have a child? Pete's child?<br> Does that matter now?<br> If it's true, it does.<br> It happens not to be true.<br> Then you were lying.<br> Yes.<br> Sandra, do you remember telling me<br> sarcastically in Philadelphia...<br> ...if I wished to leave Pete a letter marked<br> "personal," he'd receive it unopened?<br> Here's a letter from you to Pete<br> marked "personal. "<br> In that you tell him you're going<br> to have a child, don't you?<br> Yes, yes, yes.<br> Sandra, be honest with yourself.<br> You only wanted that child...<br> ...when you thought you could get<br> Pete back, didn't you?<br> Now he's dead.<br> I came here to ask you for that child.<br> - What?<br> - I was married to Pete.<br> I could give him Pete's name.<br> I could give him everything that Pete<br> could have given him, had he lived.<br> Sandra, why shouldn't you hate me?<br> It's the same old story, isn't it?<br> We both loved the same man.<br> So you admit that, do you?<br> Of course I must admit it.<br> I do believe there's one true thing<br> about you, Sandra.<br> And that's your feeling for Pete.<br> You know, I can't think of him as gone.<br> How he loved life.<br> He left us two things in this world.<br> I have his money,<br> you might have his child.<br> You're extravagant, you're a woman<br> of the world, a public figure.<br> Your piano, your success,<br> they won't go on forever.<br> None of us gets younger.<br> Let me ensure your future<br> and you ensure mine.<br> - Your future?<br> - His child.<br> That could be my future.<br> And I'd make you secure<br> financially always.<br> - Money.<br> - Yes.<br> That's so completely mad.<br> Oh, think, Sandra.<br> Oh, no, I couldn't do it now.<br> It's different.<br> I'd be alone. I'd be afraid.<br> But you needn't be.<br> I won't leave you for an instant.<br> You?<br> Sandra...<br> ...let's call a truce.<br> - A what?<br> A truce until it's over.<br> - You haven't told anyone else?<br> - Of course not.<br> We'll go away secretly.<br> You say no one knows,<br> no one else will know.<br> Don't worry about anything.<br> Leave the arrangements,<br> everything to me.<br> Hello.<br> Oh, I'll do that.<br> Here's the latest issue of Fashion.<br> The smell of cooking is making me sick.<br> Boiled vegetables.<br> And chicken.<br> You can't have steak every day.<br> There.<br> That's better.<br> You won't strain your eyes.<br> Oh, I brought you something.<br> - What is it?<br> - Open it and see.<br> Sadie?<br> Here's some more apples.<br> She's raising a rumpus<br> about the stew.<br> I know, but she can't have steak<br> every day.<br> I ordered them from New York.<br> Piano and orchestra.<br> Here, let me play them for you.<br> Whatever gave you the idea<br> that he's a pianist?<br> He's a fake.<br> Sorry. I guess I don't know much<br> about music.<br> Well, here are your things.<br> Cologne, talc, bath salts, lilac.<br> Couldn't get gardenia.<br> Vitamin B tablets.<br> What's in the big box?<br> Oh, things that we'll need later.<br> What things?<br> Stuff the doctor ordered.<br> Oh, I got you something else too.<br> You like color, Sandra, look.<br> Isn't that pretty?<br> Lovely. Suppose you wear it.<br> Did you bring my sleeping tablets?<br> - No.<br> - Forget them?<br> - No.<br> - Well, why?<br> Well, I asked the doctor.<br> - What did he say?<br> - He said no.<br> You couldn't have told him<br> how badly I was sleeping.<br> I told him how badly I was.<br> It amounted to the same thing.<br> I don't ask you sit up nights with me.<br> Oh, I know you don't.<br> I have to keep my eyes on you.<br> Hey, how many?<br> My third since lunch.<br> Three, four, five, six, seven.<br> This pack holds 20.<br> All right, all right, all right.<br> I smoked 12 cigarettes since lunch.<br> If you really wanna know,<br> I had six this morning.<br> - I knew that.<br> - Spying on me.<br> - I have to.<br> - Why?<br> Because you're such a liar.<br> - You smoke your head off.<br> - Oh, sure, but that's me.<br> I'm not special.<br> What do you want me to do,<br> sit here and go crazy?<br> Why don't you take a walk?<br> Oh, it's too cold.<br> Wear your fur coat.<br> That's a good idea.<br> I'll wear my new mink cape.<br> There might be a photographer<br> from Fashion...<br> ...waiting to snap me<br> as I step over a cactus.<br> Sandra. Ham, onions, butter...<br> ...everything the doctor said<br> you couldn't have.<br> What have you got behind your back?<br> Come on. Hand it over.<br> Pickles. Oh, Sandra.<br> Yes, pickles. I like them.<br> - I know you do.<br> - I want them.<br> I'm sick and tired of doing<br> without things I want.<br> You and that doctor with your crazy ideas<br> of what I can and what I can't eat.<br> You're starving me.<br> But you've kept very well on this diet.<br> You know you have.<br> And it's not for much longer.<br> And left alone, how you eat.<br> That's the way I'm made.<br> I'm not one of you anemic creatures...<br> ...who can get nourishment<br> from a lettuce leaf.<br> I'm a musician. I'm an artist.<br> I have zest in appetite and I like food.<br> I've been lying awake thinking about food<br> and now I'm gonna have it...<br> Sandra, Sandra, sit down.<br> I'll make you a sandwich.<br> But no pickles.<br> No onions?<br> A very thin slice.<br> Whoever heard of an ounce of brandy?<br> The doctor said, as long as you were used<br> to brandy, you could have an ounce a day.<br> But no more.<br> Come on, Sandra, play.<br> Just because you don't drink.<br> Oh, I do, I love a drink.<br> I haven't had any up here...<br> ...because you weren't allowed it.<br> - That's very kind of you.<br> I suppose you think<br> I'm a chronic alcoholic.<br> Oh, Sandra, I don't.<br> This will probably turn into a cyclone,<br> one of those tornadoes...<br> ...you read about in the newspapers,<br> and blow us all away.<br> I wish it would.<br> Oh.<br> I'm stifling.<br> Well, let's...<br> Let's play over here.<br> Come on, Sandra.<br> We've got time for one more game.<br> The wind is driving me mad.<br> Can't you do something about that lamp?<br> It's a pity you couldn't have found<br> a place with electric light.<br> Well, I could have.<br> I'd have also found newspaper reporters.<br> If you want privacy,<br> you have to pay for it.<br> Why don't you tell me<br> I've smoked enough?<br> Well, if it will take your mind off<br> the weather...<br> That's right, be patient with me.<br> I'm a spoiled child, an imbecile,<br> to be humored.<br> Maggie, the martyr. You make me sick.<br> As for keeping my mind off weather,<br> who brought me here?<br> - Come on, Sandra. Let's play.<br> - You brought me here and I've had enough.<br> I'm fed up with the whole business.<br> I'm going to get out of here.<br> Sandra.<br> No, you can't keep me here<br> and I won't stay. I won't stay.<br> Don't go like this. It's not good for you.<br> I'm going to the garage<br> and start that car and get out.<br> Be careful with that lamp,<br> you'll set the house on fire.<br> Oh, I will? That will be fine.<br> - That will settle everything.<br> - Sandra.<br> You burned me. You burned me.<br> No.<br> No.<br> Sandra, I'm sorry. Really, I am.<br> I'm sorry. Come on.<br> Maggie.<br> Maggie.<br> Isn't that doctor here yet?<br> He should be any minute.<br> Ed left an hour ago.<br> I never thought I'd be doing this<br> with some hick doctor taking care of me.<br> He's not a hick doctor.<br> Oh, no, he's a Park Avenue specialist.<br> That's why he's in Arizona<br> delivering babies at a nickel a bunch.<br> You know very well why. He could easily be<br> a Park Avenue specialist if he wanted to.<br> That's what he says.<br> Now, look, Sandra,<br> I know you're uncomfortable.<br> But don't worry about Dr. Ferguson.<br> I know about him,<br> that's why I took this place.<br> He's had a brilliant record<br> at Johns Hopkins.<br> Oh, I suppose he knows his job.<br> I wish he'd get here.<br> You smoke a lot, don't you?<br> Yes.<br> Sadie, don't leave her alone<br> for a minute.<br> - So you never had a child of your own, huh?<br> - No.<br> Mm. A pity.<br> Just the sort of woman<br> that should have them.<br> - Oh, well, you'll have plenty of time.<br> - I suppose so.<br> It spells life with capital letters.<br> A woman without a child<br> is like a man without an arm.<br> The right arm.<br> Tragic, the father dying<br> before the child was born.<br> Did you know the father?<br> Yes.<br> What sort of man was he?<br> Oh, he was handsome and clever<br> and gay.<br> - Will you have some coffee?<br> - Yeah.<br> Doctor?<br> Do you know what I miss here tonight?<br> I miss the father standing around<br> getting in everybody's way.<br> Waiting for me to say:<br> "Well, old man, it's all over<br> and they're doing nicely. "<br> Doctor?<br> All right.<br> There he is, safe and sound.<br> Pete.<br> Oh, Pete, my darling.<br> Bravo.<br> Now, here, you see, is the river.<br> The Amazon.<br> - And down here is Manaos.<br> - Manaos.<br> The nearest point<br> which they could be brought.<br> Up here, this section here.<br> That's all jungle. It's almost impassable.<br> But where were they heard of? Here?<br> Oh, I can't tell you that.<br> All I know is that the searching party<br> left Manaos yesterday by canoe.<br> They must have had something to go on.<br> Of course, it's just the vaguest chance.<br> What are you up to? Hello, Colonel<br> Harriston. I didn't now that you were here.<br> You're always whispering.<br> Want your coffee here?<br> - Come here, darling.<br> - What?<br> Harriston has come over to tell me<br> there's a faint chance...<br> ...of at least two of those men being alive<br> down here in Brazil.<br> Do you mean Pete?<br> Well, they have rumors<br> of whites living with natives up here.<br> Miles away from anywhere.<br> - You mean Peter Van Allen?<br> - Possibly.<br> We don't know that.<br> There's a rescue party going in to see.<br> Then I must telephone to Maggie at once,<br> but I don't know where to get her.<br> Last I heard was a post card<br> months ago...<br> ...from, I think, the Grand Canyon.<br> Something about Old Faithful.<br> I wouldn't say a word. Remember<br> the suspense when they were lost?<br> - I'll never forget it, nor Maggie's face.<br> - We don't want that.<br> After all, it's just a chance.<br> No, I think you're quite right.<br> I shan't say a word.<br> Oh, Ted. Do you realize it's months<br> since we've heard from that girl?<br> All the better. Save us some awkward<br> moments while we're waiting.<br> Yeah. You're not going, colonel.<br> - I'm afraid I must.<br> - I wanna follow this thing through.<br> Oh, well, I'm sorry.<br> Anyone would think<br> you hadn't been fed for a month.<br> Here, Mabel, greedy.<br> Give your sister a chance.<br> Now, that's all for today.<br> It's Petie's feeding time, Miss Maggie.<br> We're coming.<br> Come on, Petie, going in to lunch.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> There we go.<br> Pete, now we'll have a little lunch.<br> Yes, we will.<br> Now we're gonna have our lunch.<br> Come on. Come on, darling.<br> I got his lunch all ready for him.<br> - We know.<br> You know, I was thinking, Violet,<br> Mr. Pete went to college at Yale.<br> I suppose he'd like Young Pete<br> to go there too.<br> Yes, Miss Maggie.<br> Shall I go up and pack his things now...<br> ...or would in the morning<br> be soon enough?<br> Oh, Violet.<br> He sure going to look mighty funny up<br> at that Yale college without any teeth.<br> I am silly.<br> Now you're talking sense.<br> Straining your eyes to appear<br> What you going to be doing<br> in the meantime?<br> Bringing up this young gent.<br> You is young, Miss Maggie,<br> and your little boy needs a pappy.<br> And you, Miss Maggie,<br> you ain't hardly had no marriage at all.<br> Nope. No other man for me.<br> You're the man of the family now,<br> aren't you, Pete?<br> - We mustn't spoil him, Violet.<br> - No, ma'am.<br> What's that?<br> Oh, Pete, you're getting bigger<br> every single day.<br> It looks like your Aunt Ada's automobile<br> coming through the gate.<br> Really?<br> Well, I didn't know she was coming.<br> - Here, you'd better take Pete and feed him.<br> - Yes'm.<br> - Aunt Ada will probably stay for lunch.<br> - Yes'm.<br> - Violet, there's the telephone. Answer it.<br> - Yes'm.<br> Violet will lay you down here.<br> I is a-coming, telephone.<br> Hello there.<br> What a surprise.<br> Where did you spring from?<br> Washington. I came like the wind.<br> How are you, Maggie?<br> Never felt better.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> Come on in then.<br> - Is that your baby crying?<br> - Oh, yes. Violet's with him.<br> Darling, let me have your things.<br> Maggie, I hardly know how to begin.<br> - But you're trembling. What is it?<br> Miss Maggie.<br> - Miss Maggie.<br> Yes, what's the matter?<br> You're wanted on the telephone.<br> It's a telegram.<br> I just couldn't write it down.<br> You better go.<br> All right. Excuse me, Auntie.<br> Violet...<br> ...I came down to be with her<br> when she got the news.<br> - It is a telegram?<br> - Yes'm.<br> Just like the grave opened up and spoke.<br> Quiet, Young Pete.<br> Hello.<br> Yes?<br> Yes, this is Mrs. Van Allen.<br> Go ahead.<br> From where?<br> - Signed Pete?<br> - Ted was down in a place called Manaos...<br> Oh, but... Darling. Shh, shh.<br> What? Go ahead.<br> Yes?<br> "Could not wait telephone connection. "<br> Yes.<br> "On my way"?<br> - Your uncle telephoned me this morning...<br> - Auntie Addy, please? Go ahead.<br> Yes?<br> "Arrive Cartersville. " Yes.<br> "About midnight Thursday. "<br> "Love, Pete. "<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Arriving Cartersville<br> about midnight Thursday?<br> - Pete and another man were found.<br> - Why didn't you tell me?<br> - When did you first hear?<br> - About six weeks ago.<br> Harriston came to your uncle...<br> Arriving Cartersville<br> about midnight Thursday.<br> But that's today.<br> Darling, your father's coming home.<br> Yes, yes.<br> That's Pete. That's his signal.<br> How far is it to the airport?<br> Oh, about 10 miles farther on.<br> What time is it, Parker?<br> Eleven thirty-five, ma'am.<br> He's over here, this way, towards home.<br> He's gonna land at home like he used to.<br> Come on, Parker. Turn around.<br> He'll land,<br> and we won't be there to meet him.<br> - That can't be nobody else except Mr. Pete.<br> - It sure can't. Listen to that engine.<br> You go right on<br> and call the airplane station...<br> ...and tell Miss Maggie<br> to come right smack home.<br> You go right on and stand...<br> Be standing by.<br> - Maggie.<br> - Take it easy, Pete.<br> Mr. Pete, Mr. Pete.<br> The next thing I expects to hear<br> is the angel Gabriel blowing his horn.<br> Good evening, Violet, where are they?<br> Good evening.<br> They is at the airplane station.<br> They reckoned you was landing there.<br> Jefferson, he's telephoning.<br> Home.<br> This is your home, Mr. Pete.<br> This is where you belong.<br> Oh?<br> Hear that, Mr. Pete?<br> Hear that welcome for you?<br> - That's him, isn't it?<br> - Who else?<br> Well... Well, I think I'll wait here<br> till his mother gets here.<br> Hey, you don't think he's having<br> any trouble, do you?<br> You think he's all right?<br> Well, I better go see.<br> Come on, Mr. Pete.<br> I knows what you want.<br> You want to get up<br> and say howdy to your pappy.<br> You ain't no poor, little orphan no more.<br> You has got a pappy<br> just like any other little boy.<br> Hold his little head.<br> There.<br> There he is, Mr. Pete.<br> The sweetest little lamb<br> that ever drew the breath of life.<br> - Where is he?<br> - He's upstairs.<br> Oh, Pete.<br> What about that?<br> Oh, yes.<br> What's his name?<br> We call him "Young Pete. "<br> Do you like him?<br> He's lovely.<br> Darling, you look ill.<br> Oh, no. I'm all right. Really.<br> - Tell me, are you all right?<br> - Of course I'm all right.<br> Oh, Maggie...<br> ...do you think I've changed?<br> Oh, the grey hair.<br> - A sober, solid citizen, remember?<br> - Yes.<br> Maggie...<br> ...let me look at you<br> to see if you've changed.<br> Have I?<br> No.<br> Nothing was the same without you.<br> Nothing.<br> He's like me.<br> Young Pete, oh, yes.<br> How old is he?<br> Three months and four days exactly.<br> Our son.<br> Yes.<br> Our son.<br> He was all I had of you.<br> Except so often,<br> I had the feeling you were here.<br> Laughing at me and chasing me...<br> ...and roaming around<br> in that silly little plane.<br> Yes, but, Maggie, I'm here now.<br> But you know what? It still seems<br> like I'm seeing you through a mist.<br> Jungles and dark woods.<br> But, darling, you're here.<br> You've come home.<br> Did she really wanna go up<br> and take that baby with her?<br> No, she wanted to hold<br> the plane on the ground.<br> Says it's bad for his ears.<br> Don't you ever let me catch you<br> taking that baby up ever.<br> No, ma'am. But ever is a long time.<br> Isn't it, Petie?<br> Topsy-turvy like you.<br> "Out with the boys. " Now, really.<br> Violet, you're spoiling the show.<br> There's only one show going on now,<br> and that's that baby going to his bed.<br> Violet's right, Pete.<br> Do you know what time it is?<br> - Anyway, that's bad for his eyes, darling.<br> - The plane is bad for his ears.<br> Movies are bad for his eyes.<br> It'll be tough on his feet.<br> - What?<br> - When he learns to walk.<br> Mr. Pete, can I trouble you<br> for this bundle?<br> Very good.<br> Sleep well.<br> Oh, would you like a nightcap<br> before you turn in?<br> - Now, kiss your mammy.<br> - Good night, darling.<br> - And wave bye-bye.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> Yeah, he's going with Violet.<br> Violet's gonna put him to bed.<br> You know, Maggie, nobody but you<br> could have such a lovely baby.<br> Oh, he'd be a perfect baby<br> no matter who his mother was.<br> Why can't we take him with us<br> to New York tomorrow?<br> Pete, you're insane.<br> But he'd like New York.<br> How do you know?<br> He told me he would.<br> You're absolutely mad.<br> He's a marvelous boy.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> You know, I have dozens of these.<br> If you really enjoy looking at them...<br> ...I could send you 50 to Washington<br> if you send them back.<br> - He'll send you 150 if you want.<br> Your Coke, sir.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Coke, my eye.<br> - That's a Cuba libre.<br> - Do you mind?<br> No, darling, we're on a spree.<br> But don't forget, I'm right here beside you.<br> - First time in New York since I got back.<br> - It's a celebration.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Guess.<br> I don't know.<br> Pete, darling.<br> What does one say to a ghost?<br> Hello, Maggie. I couldn't believe it<br> when I heard you were alive.<br> It was in Australia before a concert.<br> I drank champagne...<br> ...and played Chopin's "Funeral March"<br> in swing time, actually.<br> - Have a drink?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Colonel Harriston, Miss Kovak.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Staying in town long?<br> No, we're going home tomorrow.<br> - Running away so soon?<br> - We've been here a week.<br> - I do miss the country.<br> - That's what she says. Don't believe her.<br> She's just dying to get back to her boy.<br> She hates being away from him. Oh.<br> I've got something to show you.<br> - Here.<br> - Oh, pictures. Oh, I love them.<br> That's the son and heir.<br> What do you think of him?<br> Why, he's so big.<br> He's 31 inches tall, weighs 29 pounds,<br> has eight teeth and he bites.<br> And if you don't believe me,<br> just ask that puppy there.<br> Oh, he's lovely.<br> And here.<br> Here's one taken with his mother.<br> I think he looks like Maggie.<br> But she will have it that he looks like me.<br> He is like you.<br> - Oh, but he has Maggie's smile.<br> - Perhaps.<br> I don't know much about babies.<br> Well, I must go.<br> You're both looking so well.<br> That must have been quite a moment...<br> ...when you told Pete about the baby.<br> I'd like to have been there.<br> Well, that's what I call a striking woman.<br> Mister and Missis...<br> Come on.<br> Here you go. Here.<br> Jefferson, take them.<br> Come on, Mister and Missis,<br> get your supper with the rest of them.<br> Well, here I am.<br> Yes, I was expecting you.<br> - Going to ask me to stay?<br> - No.<br> - You'd better.<br> Maggie.<br> Maggie. Maggie.<br> Pete.<br> - Why, Sandra.<br> - Hello, darling. How are you?<br> What are you doing here?<br> I hardly know myself.<br> I was motoring to White Sulphur Springs.<br> I realized<br> I'd gone through to Maryland...<br> ...that you lived in Maryland,<br> and here I am.<br> I hope I'm not intruding.<br> Of course not.<br> Would you like some tea?<br> - I'd rather have a drink.<br> - Good.<br> - Gee, Sandra, you're looking fine.<br> I feel well. A little tired.<br> Oh, I love this place.<br> Yes, I must show it to you.<br> I was wondering,<br> could you put me up for the night?<br> I was going to White Sulphur<br> for a rest anyway. I've had a tough season.<br> Why, yes, I suppose we could.<br> Couldn't we, Maggie?<br> Why, yes.<br> Oh, that would be lovely. Thanks.<br> How much ground have you got here?<br> Oh, about 20 acres. You see,<br> we're still sort of doing the house over.<br> Maggie used the other wing.<br> This part of the house used to be shut off.<br> I see. And when the family expanded,<br> the house went with it.<br> Mm-hm. That addition,<br> let me tell you, is something.<br> I can hardly wait to see it.<br> It? It's a him.<br> Oh, that's right. It was a boy, wasn't it?<br> - What would you like to drink, Sandra?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Mint julep?<br> - Lovely.<br> - What are you drinking?<br> - The same.<br> Three mint juleps,<br> nice and cold and frosty.<br> Yes, sir, Mr. Pete.<br> I'm dying to see that baby.<br> - Could we go up now?<br> - Of course you can.<br> Pete, it's time for his bath.<br> - I know.<br> - Can't I see him in his bath?<br> Why, certainly. Come on.<br> Isn't the proud mama coming?<br> Oh, here he is.<br> Oh, he's got company.<br> - Good evening, ma'am.<br> - Good evening.<br> Lady come to see you.<br> - Has he had his bath?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Now take your little bow<br> the way Violet taught you.<br> He's kind of shy of strangers.<br> He's got to get over that now.<br> Let me have him, Violet.<br> - Go to your pappy.<br> - Come on now.<br> - There.<br> - Now, no more nonsense.<br> Now, go on bow for the lady.<br> There, that's it.<br> That's a good boy.<br> Now you go to your mother.<br> - What do you think of him?<br> - Oh, I like him.<br> - What's that?<br> - He always likes his little tune...<br> ...before he goes to sleep.<br> Oh, musical?<br> Where do I sleep?<br> In the south room.<br> Jefferson will light the fire.<br> I'll show you.<br> Maggie likes to stay and tuck him in.<br> Shall we have that drink first, Pete?<br> They's nice and frosty, Mr. Pete.<br> Coming right down, Jefferson.<br> Pete.<br> - Hm?<br> Come on. Our drinks are waiting.<br> Hey, aren't you dressed yet?<br> Oh, are we dressing?<br> Well, I thought you'd want to.<br> We have a guest.<br> - What's the matter? You got a headache?<br> - No.<br> Well, then you better hurry.<br> It's almost 7:00.<br> All right.<br> Harriett won't leave New York,<br> even in the winter.<br> She was a good sort.<br> Didn't she lose money?<br> No, that's the story she tells.<br> Fuzzy left her a lot.<br> Did Fuzzy die?<br> No, he gave her a lot.<br> He's in a home for inebriates,<br> someplace in New Jersey.<br> Oh. Hello, darling. You're late.<br> - We've already had three.<br> - Three?<br> Oh, Maggie, that wifely tone.<br> Do you count his cigarettes too?<br> It's doctor's orders.<br> Doctor's orders.<br> How familiar that sounds.<br> Would you believe it?<br> I was under doctor's orders.<br> You?<br> Yes. I had to count my cigarettes,<br> my drinks and my calories.<br> I had a little dragon watching over me<br> every minute to see that I did it.<br> It didn't seem to do you any harm.<br> No, I have never seen you look<br> more blooming.<br> - Come on. Have another one.<br> - Why, I shouldn't.<br> But how I love to do things I shouldn't.<br> To my hostess.<br> Maggie, my dear, may you always be<br> as happy as you are now.<br> Dinner's served.<br> You always were a traveler.<br> You would love Australia, Pete.<br> It's a great man's country.<br> Earthy and exciting.<br> Reminds me of our own West.<br> You know, Arizona.<br> Arizona?<br> That's where Young Pete was born.<br> Oh, really?<br> Yeah.<br> - Not here in the ancestral home?<br> - No.<br> That's when I was missing.<br> Pretty grim for Maggie.<br> No wonder she wanted to get away<br> from people.<br> Mr. Pete, you're wanted<br> on the telephone. Long distance.<br> Oh, excuse me, ladies.<br> Jefferson, we'll have our coffee<br> in the drawing room.<br> Oh, I'll take my brandy with me.<br> Put the coffee there.<br> What are you going to do?<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - Nothing.<br> - You're going to hold me to my bargain?<br> - Yes.<br> When I made it,<br> I didn't know Pete was alive.<br> When you thought he was dead,<br> you didn't want that child.<br> Now he's alive, you want both.<br> It was never a part of the bargain<br> that Pete should be alive.<br> The money you gave me is in trust.<br> It's never been touched.<br> You're not going to tell Pete.<br> No, Maggie.<br> I'm not going to tell him.<br> You're going to tell him.<br> And I'm gonna stay here until you do.<br> Well, that's that.<br> Harriston has new planes<br> that he wants me to see.<br> I think I'm gonna say good night.<br> I won't have any coffee.<br> It might keep me awake.<br> I want sleep.<br> - Sleep? You're not turning in now?<br> - Maggie looks a little tired.<br> Are you, Maggie? It's so early.<br> I won't go to bed right away.<br> I'll read and write letters.<br> Open the windows<br> and get some of your good country air.<br> - You've got luncheon guests tomorrow.<br> - Yes.<br> Then I think you've had quite enough<br> for one evening.<br> - Good night and try and get some rest.<br> - Good night, Sandra.<br> Oh, don't bother, Maggie.<br> I can find my way.<br> Good night, Sandra.<br> Coffee?<br> What's going on between you two?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Well, something must have happened.<br> Did Sandra say anything to upset you?<br> No, she didn't.<br> Well, then, my darling,<br> don't you think you've let me down a little?<br> How?<br> Well, I don't know<br> why Sandra came here.<br> But I'm sure she came here<br> for some reason.<br> And I particularly wanted her to see<br> how happy we are.<br> We are happy, aren't we?<br> Of course.<br> Then, my darling, don't you think you could<br> have taken some other way of showing it?<br> You hardly ate. You hardly spoke.<br> Anyone would think that I beat you<br> in private.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Maggie, there's something between us<br> tonight.<br> I don't know what it is<br> but it's like flying in a fog.<br> I can't seem to get my bearings<br> and I don't like it.<br> We've always told each other everything,<br> haven't we?<br> That's been the great thing. No secrets.<br> Always honest with each other,<br> haven't we?<br> Well, then don't you think you can tell me<br> what's making you unhappy?<br> Maggie, I think I know what it is.<br> It's Sandra. Her being here<br> is what upset you, hasn't it?<br> And you think that... Well, that I still<br> find her attractive, don't you?<br> Do you?<br> I'd be lying to you if I said anything else.<br> Any man would find Sandra attractive.<br> Perhaps even a little exciting.<br> But you see, Maggie,<br> I'm not just any man now.<br> I'm your husband.<br> The father of Young Pete.<br> And believe me,<br> that makes a whale of a difference.<br> You and Young Pete.<br> You'd have to be a man<br> to know what that means.<br> But it's the tops.<br> What time is it, Violet?<br> I didn't get to sleep till early this morning.<br> It's 10:00. I've laid your clothes out.<br> That wretched lunch.<br> What am I going to do?<br> The first thing you'll do is drink your coffee.<br> There ain't nobody coming for an hour.<br> And me and Jefferson done got everything<br> under control.<br> Well, give them their mint juleps<br> when they arrive.<br> And then smoked turkey<br> and Virginia ham...<br> ...and then all the hot dishes<br> out on the buffet.<br> I don't want anything to go wrong,<br> Violet.<br> Oh, is Kovak up yet?<br> Her? Laws, yes.<br> She was up with the birds.<br> Had breakfast and then come<br> to the nursery and took the baby.<br> Where?<br> What's the matter with you this morning?<br> You're as white as the tablecloth.<br> She just took him for a little walk.<br> They is down on the lawn.<br> - He's not a bit afraid, is he?<br> - No. No.<br> You're not afraid, are you?<br> All right.<br> Good morning, Maggie.<br> Good morning.<br> Hello, sleepy head.<br> Hello.<br> I'm sorry I slept so late.<br> I'm getting dressed now.<br> Take your time. I'm getting acquainted<br> with this young man.<br> He's a darling.<br> Yes, isn't he?<br> I'm thinking of stealing him.<br> You better not try it.<br> Here, Miss Maggie.<br> Pete.<br> - Pete.<br> - Maggie.<br> I've changed my mind since last night.<br> If you think I'll stand by, let Pete think that<br> child is yours and say nothing, you're crazy.<br> Why didn't you tell him the truth<br> when he came back?<br> Why did you lie to him?<br> I didn't lie to him.<br> Pete thinks that child is yours.<br> He is.<br> - What?<br> - I didn't lie to Pete.<br> The child is mine.<br> Your part was finished<br> the minute you gave that baby to me.<br> From that day on,<br> I had only one purpose in my life...<br> ...to make that baby mine<br> and to forget that you ever existed.<br> So you told Pete the baby was yours.<br> What did you think I'd do about that?<br> Oh, I don't know what I thought.<br> That you'd never come back.<br> That perhaps you'd marry<br> and stay away for years.<br> Perhaps you'd die.<br> I hoped you would.<br> But I didn't die and I haven't stayed away,<br> and I want that child.<br> Sandra, you walked away from<br> that baby without one backward look.<br> - I've seen him.<br> - You could have anytime. We made no rule.<br> I was in Australia.<br> It takes more than an ocean to keep a<br> mother from a child she really wants to see.<br> All those months, you never<br> wrote me one line asking about him.<br> You were perfectly satisfied to have him<br> off your hands.<br> Why, if that had been my child,<br> I'd have never given him up.<br> But he's not your child<br> and you're going to give him up.<br> You could justify that lie to yourself,<br> but you can't justify it to Pete.<br> He'll never forgive you, Maggie.<br> Oh, you're not going to tell Pete,<br> are you?<br> You see, you're afraid. You don't dare<br> tell him how you've lied to him.<br> I'll tell you something else you're afraid of.<br> You're afraid you'll lose Pete. You will.<br> He never loved you as he loved me.<br> You were second choice.<br> You caught him on the rebound.<br> There's only one thing holding him<br> to you, Maggie, and that's my baby.<br> I'd be too proud to hold a man<br> with another woman's child.<br> Pete...<br> ...come here.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Sit down.<br> - I've got something to tell you.<br> - Oh, what?<br> I've lied to you about Young Pete.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean, he isn't mine.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - He belongs to Sandra.<br> Sandra's his mother.<br> He's mine, Pete.<br> Yours and mine.<br> I'll tell you as simply as I can.<br> When you were in South America<br> before you were missing...<br> ...Sandra told me she was going<br> to have a child.<br> Your child.<br> And then when you didn't come back<br> and we thought you were dead...<br> ...well, it wasn't an easy situation<br> for Sandra to face alone...<br> ...so I went away with her and stayed<br> until Young Pete was born.<br> Then I persuaded her to let me take him.<br> It was the only way he could have<br> the place in life he was entitled to.<br> He was your son.<br> So Sandra gave him up...<br> ...so he could have that place.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Oh.<br> That's why you went to Arizona alone.<br> That's why you didn't take Violet<br> or Aunt Ada with you.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> I thought there was something funny.<br> You were always so shy<br> about taking the credit for Young Pete.<br> And I remember you saying once:<br> "No matter who the mother is,<br> the baby would be perfect. "<br> Yeah.<br> At the time,<br> I thought that was rather sweet.<br> I liked it.<br> And you, Sandra.<br> Ever since you've been in this house...<br> ...you've been hammering sarcastically<br> at Maggie about that baby.<br> The "proud mother" business.<br> I thought there was something.<br> - Pete, don't you see that...?<br> - Yeah.<br> You told everyone that the baby was yours.<br> You lied to everyone.<br> When I came back, you even lied to me.<br> How long did you intend to go on lying,<br> Maggie?<br> Well, I couldn't bear the thought<br> of losing either of you.<br> Well, why are you telling me now?<br> Because now Sandra wants the baby.<br> - You're gonna take the baby away?<br> - He's mine, Pete.<br> When I gave him up,<br> I didn't know you were still alive.<br> - It's different now.<br> - How is it different now?<br> Sandra just told me that I was only<br> holding you because of Young Pete.<br> Her child.<br> And that if you knew<br> I'd lied to you, you...<br> Well, you'd leave me.<br> Stop. Stop it.<br> - Haven't you any sense?<br> - Oh, but...<br> Shut up.<br> Don't act like a crybaby.<br> Well, Sandra...<br> ...the baby is yours.<br> If you want to take him...<br> ...there isn't very much I can do about it.<br> He's a fine little chap...<br> ...and we'll miss him, naturally.<br> Maggie...<br> ...thank heaven we've got each other.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Here they is.<br> Your mammy and your pappy.<br> The company is almost here.<br> It's time for this little rascal<br> to have his nap.<br> Now kiss your mammy.<br> And your pappy.<br> And wave bye-bye to the lady.<br> And come on with Violet, honey child,<br> to your little bed. Yeah.<br> I wonder if I could have a drink.<br> Oh, of course.<br> Maggie, I'm not staying for lunch.<br> What about Young Pete?<br> I'm leaving him with his mother.<br> Come on.<br> If you look like that,<br> people will think I beat you.<br> If you don't stop, I will. Now, come on.<br>
