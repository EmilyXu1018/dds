This way.<br> This little lady has wiggled herself...<br> ...from the desert<br> to the shores of Lake Michigan.<br> And she's about to give you<br> an exhibition absolutely free.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the dance<br> that Little Egypt does inside...<br> ...but to prove our generosity,<br> we're going to give a demonstration...<br> ...of that famous dance,<br> the hootchy-kootch. Egypt, wiggle.<br> That's sufficient.<br> Now, ladies and gentlemen--<br> He's a masterpiece of manhood.<br> Step up to the box office and buy<br> your tickets. The show's about to begin.<br> --phenomenon.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, this--<br> Well, how's business, Ziggy?<br> And now, ladies and gentlemen,<br> Sandow concludes this performance...<br> ...by lifting, with Herculean strength,<br> the largest dumbbell in the world.<br> An unusual feat,<br> ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...for inside this huge dumbbell,<br> there are other dumbbells.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, look.<br> There you are. Aren't they beautiful?<br> Aren't they glorious?<br> A total weight of 750 pounds.<br> Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it marvelous?<br> Let's give him a big hand.<br> What made you bring me<br> to a show of this kind?<br> Well, you wouldn't let me see Little Egypt.<br> I'll bet a heifer against a mare<br> the weights ain't on the level.<br> Seven hundred and fifty pounds, my foot.<br> - I wonder what her total weight is. Oh, Bill?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Open the curtains, will you?<br> - Open up those curtains.<br> Hey, Bill, you know, it seems to me<br> that this platform--<br> Oh, hello, baby.<br> Want some candy, Jane, huh?<br> Bill, we ought to have<br> this platform built higher.<br> There ought to be more steps.<br> The people in the back row can hardly see.<br> But, Mr. Ziegfeld, there's never<br> anybody in the back rows.<br> Well, nevertheless, I want this higher.<br> There ought to be a lot more steps.<br> Okay, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> I'm sorry I lost my temper, Florenz...<br> ...but I am awful disappointed.<br> I hope you never get<br> downright disgusted.<br> What is wrong?<br> Why don't they come in?<br> You're the attraction,<br> and you're asking me?<br> Maybe you would like<br> to cancel my contract.<br> Oh, no, Sandow.<br> When I make a deal, it's a deal.<br> I like that. I like you.<br> Well, I like you too.<br> If you want to pay me some of my<br> back salary, I take you to dinner, yeah?<br> Well, I'm not very hungry.<br> You're not worrying<br> about your money, are you?<br> - You don't think I'd ever walk out on you?<br> - No, no.<br> Nobody do that to Sandow.<br> - Maybe I better take you to dinner.<br> - That's fine.<br> Hands up, mister, and give me<br> all your money.<br> Well, I can't give you anything<br> with my hands up, sweetheart.<br> All right, fresh, 23 skidoo for you.<br> I'll help myself.<br> Oh, no. Oh, I see you got<br> my little surprise.<br> This morning. Gee, ain't it swell?<br> - Were you really surprised?<br> - Well, wouldn't you be?<br> - Yes.<br> - If you expected a diamond ring.<br> Oh, don't be--<br> Tell you what we'll do.<br> - We'll go to the Little Vienna Restaurant.<br> - Oh, I'd like that.<br> - Telegram, Mr. Billings.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Just wait a minute. There might<br> be an answer. Let me see.<br> - Oh, well, I'll be.<br> - Bad news?<br> No, it's from Ziegfeld.<br> He's across the midway.<br> He can touch me,<br> but he has to send wires.<br> Listen, "In Little Egypt, you have<br> the best female attraction of the fair.<br> In Sandow, I have the greatest<br> male attraction.<br> Why not fake a romance?<br> The people will eat it up.<br> Then we can show them together,<br> and I'd be willing to split 50-50."<br> - Well, that sounds like a great idea.<br> - Oh, yes, great.<br> I'm selling out every performance,<br> he's going to be thrown out...<br> ...and he's willing to split 50-50.<br> Give me your pencil.<br> I'll answer this one.<br> - Jack?<br> - Yes.<br> - Is Ziegfeld a good friend of yours?<br> - Oh, yes, we've been pals for years.<br> - But you wouldn't like him.<br> - No?<br> No, he's up one day and broke the next.<br> If he got $ 10,000 tomorrow...<br> ...he'd spend it on the girl<br> he liked tomorrow night.<br> Wouldn't want to waste your time<br> meeting a fellow like that.<br> - Not if I met him on the right night.<br> - On the right--? Oh, don't you--<br> - Shut up! And just send that collect.<br> - Yes, sir, and I'll deliver it too, sir.<br> Because every time I take Mr. Ziegfeld<br> a message, he gives me 50 cents.<br> - Oh, he does, does he?<br> - Sure.<br> Yes, well, that's probably<br> why he's always broke. Come on, dear.<br> This cheese is so strong it could<br> walk over and say hello to your coffee.<br> Well, it had better not.<br> This coffee's too weak to answer it.<br> Florenz, you're wonderful.<br> You make jokes even when you're<br> so worried you can't touch your cold cuts.<br> I got no appetite neither.<br> No?<br> Message for you, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> - They told me I'd find you here.<br> - From Billings.<br> So soon he answers?<br> He must be crazy about your proposition.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Read it to me, Flo. Read it.<br> "Dear Ziggy, your proposition interests me."<br> What did I tell you?<br> "But why fake a romance<br> between Sandow and Little Egypt?<br> Let's make Sandow marry Little Egypt,<br> and I'll split the children with you 50-50."<br> That message was collect.<br> - Fifty cents.<br> - Have you change for a dollar?<br> - Sure, but you always....<br> - Keep it.<br> Gee, thanks.<br> Florenz, I love you.<br> I will break chains for you...<br> ...I will lift buildings for you,<br> but I will not have children for you.<br> But if I have children,<br> I will not split them.<br> - Oh, hello, Ziggy, I got your wire.<br> - I just got yours too.<br> Patterson tells me<br> he's putting you out Saturday.<br> - He tells me too.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Ziegfeld?<br> How do you--?<br> - How do you do, Miss...?<br> - Yes, Blair, this is Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> - I'm very happy to know you, Miss Blair.<br> - I'm so happy to meet you, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> And this is Mr. Sandow,<br> the strongest man in the--<br> The strongest man in the world.<br> Jack tells me<br> the loveliest things about you.<br> Oh, yes, I imagine.<br> - I could tell you lovely things about you.<br> - He's only just met you...<br> ...and he's going to tell<br> you all about yourself.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Oh, but no, we've got-- There's a table--<br> - I've seen you many times...<br> ...on the midway.<br> - Fibber. I bet you never even noticed me.<br> - Yes, I have.<br> Yesterday, you were wearing<br> a red dress trimmed in black lace.<br> - Yes.<br> - And a yellow hat, and it was atrocious.<br> - Oh, indeed?<br> - Each was all right in itself, mind you...<br> ...but the combination....<br> And last Sunday, you were wearing<br> a blue gown and an orchid hat.<br> - Well, yes.<br> - And you were wrong again.<br> Well, aren't we the observer?<br> Do you always check the right<br> combinations for women?<br> - Always for beautiful women.<br> - Oh, well, that's nice. Thank you.<br> - How do I look today?<br> - Well, I don't like your hat.<br> - It shades your eyes, and I like your eyes.<br> - Thank you.<br> He ought to be packing his own clothes<br> instead of selecting yours.<br> - Come on, Ruth, we've got to go.<br> - Yes. Well, goodbye, then.<br> - I'll be seeing you around the grounds.<br> - Yes. Well, not after Saturday, you won't.<br> - That fella Billings makes me mad.<br> - Yes?<br> Even that music from his Little Egypt<br> drives me crazy.<br> You won't have to listen to it<br> much longer. Wait a minute.<br> Come away. For five weeks you've been<br> touching that elephant for luck...<br> ...and now in five days, we get put out.<br> I know it's superstition,<br> but an old Hindu told me...<br> ...that if you touch an elephant's trunk,<br> and he raises it, everything will be all right.<br> Wait, wait. We know we got hard luck<br> without that elephant should tell us.<br> Say, I know what's wrong. You should<br> touch him. You're the attraction.<br> - Me?<br> - Sure. Go on, go ahead.<br> It sounds silly, but all right, I'll do it.<br> Look, Florenz, would he do that for me?<br> The Great Sandow.<br> Sandow.<br> So that's what you call good luck, yeah?<br> Look, Sandow, you've got to expect<br> a little rain with the sunshine.<br> That was very embarrassing, Florenz,<br> very embarrassing.<br> Don't get your dander up. Who knows?<br> Maybe that little shower<br> will bring us oodles of luck.<br> Well, I hope it brings us<br> so much business like that Little Egypt.<br> Look at those peoples, how they crowd<br> in to see that woman make wiggles...<br> ...when yet they wouldn't come to see me<br> lift weights no other man in the world can.<br> Sandow, I'm afraid your trouble<br> is you developed the wrong muscles.<br> What you say? Every muscle<br> in Sandow's body is developed...<br> ...even the toes, like that.<br> With one arm I make a better dance<br> than that Little Egypt with the whole body.<br> Look, boss.<br> Good heavens!<br> - Are you Mr. Sandow, the strongman?<br> - Yes, madam, this is the Great Sandow.<br> Oh, look at those huge shoulders.<br> Aren't they marvelous?<br> - Yes, dear, come on.<br> - And that big chest.<br> - I never saw a chest like that before.<br> - Oh, come on.<br> And his waistline, oh,<br> it's simply magnificent.<br> - Precious, come on.<br> - Just a minute, dear.<br> Mr. Sandow, I think your muscles<br> are simply astounding.<br> Perhaps madam would like<br> to feel the muscles of Sandow.<br> - Oh, I'd love to.<br> - Sandow, your arm.<br> - Florenz, is she dead?<br> - No, she's only fainted.<br> - But, oh, what an idea. Come on!<br> - What? Wait a minute. What's wrong?<br> - Where are you going?<br> - The papers. To the newspapers.<br> I'll fill them so full,<br> women will fight to see you.<br> Not to watch you lift weights,<br> but simply to feel your muscles.<br> Why, you've got more sex appeal<br> in your one arm...<br> ...than Little Egypt has in her whole--<br> Sandow, the modern Hercules.<br> The miracle of strength.<br> Watch his muscles quiver<br> in musical rhythm. Sandow, quiver.<br> Sufficient.<br> And now, ladies, if you want<br> to see more of the Great Sandow...<br> ...if your hearts are strong enough<br> to stand the thrill...<br> ...step up and buy your ticket.<br> The show starts in five minutes.<br> - Folks, this is the show--<br> - How's business, Jack?<br> All right?<br> - Doesn't it sparkle?<br> - Yes, doesn't it?<br> - You like it?<br> - I certainly do.<br> I'm glad.<br> - Dr. Ziegfeld.<br> - Yeah?<br> Can't I play my piece for you now?<br> I get awful tired of this....<br> I don't blame you, Mary Lou. So do I.<br> Go ahead, then.<br> Go on, play your little piece now.<br> - Dr. Ziegfeld?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> - Do you know I was mad at your son?<br> - What?<br> Mad at your best fella?<br> Oh, but why?<br> Because he left us for that old World's Fair.<br> Oh, well, darling, you know<br> the fair closed yesterday.<br> And is he coming back here again?<br> Well, I hope so.<br> Go on. You go on with your lesson.<br> - Dr. Ziegfeld.<br> - Yes, dear.<br> Did you know I was<br> going to marry your son?<br> Well, well, this is so sudden.<br> - Are you?<br> - Oh, yes. We got that settled months ago.<br> Oh, yes, Father, didn't you know<br> Mary Lou and I are engaged?<br> Well, don't I get a kiss today?<br> Not even a smile?<br> Well, Father, what do you think of that?<br> My future wife won't even kiss me...<br> - ...and I brought her a present too.<br> - What?<br> - Kiss first.<br> - No, present first.<br> No, kiss first. I'll tell you what. We'll both<br> give at the same time. How's that?<br> I'll count three. Ready? One.<br> - Two.<br> - Same time, remember.<br> Three.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Dr. Ziegfeld, isn't it lovely?<br> - Beautiful.<br> - I'm going to open it right now.<br> - Right now. Yes.<br> - Oh, well, well, well.<br> Well, Florenz, what have<br> you decided to do?<br> Well, I'm going to New York<br> tomorrow, Dad.<br> With that Sandow, that strongman?<br> Father, I don't really belong here.<br> No, I don't like it.<br> You don't like it, huh? The greatest<br> music conservatory in the country.<br> I built it all myself. Students from<br> all over the world are coming here...<br> ...and you-- You don't like it.<br> You realize that maybe somewhere<br> in one of these rooms...<br> ...we find a future<br> Beethoven or Liszt?<br> And you, my own son,<br> all you want is a circus.<br> A circus with a fellow that can<br> throw cannonballs.<br> Well, now, Dad, don't be upset.<br> - Sandow is a means to an end.<br> - Yeah, to your end.<br> When you was a little fellow, since then,<br> I've educated you in music and art.<br> From your mother, you got<br> the refinement, taste, culture.<br> What good has it all done?<br> What has it done you?<br> What are you now anyhow?<br> A muscle manager. A beef exhibitor.<br> Then you got to go on the outside,<br> and you gotta be....<br> You gotta act like a dog outside.<br> You act like a dog.<br> Wait a minute,<br> what do you mean, a dog?<br> You know what I mean. I don't mean<br> you're a dog, I mean you got--<br> You gotta go outside and be a barker.<br> That's a dog, ain't it?<br> Now let me tell you something.<br> If you go away from here...<br> ...I'll never speak to you again<br> as long as I live.<br> - Oh, Dad, you don't mean that.<br> - Yes, I do mean it.<br> And I mean-- I mean every word of it.<br> Hey, wait a minute here.<br> Now, you just stop that crying.<br> Now, you tell your fellow<br> why you're crying.<br> If you're my fellow,<br> why are you going away?<br> What--?<br> Now look here, you sit right up here,<br> and I'll tell you all about it.<br> Now, I'll be honest with you.<br> - I'm not really your fellow.<br> - You mean you don't like me anymore?<br> I not only like you, I love you.<br> But you know, I'm the funniest kind<br> of a fellow. I love all the girls.<br> How can you do that?<br> Do they let you?<br> Well, you didn't quite understand<br> what I mean, darling.<br> Look....<br> Some people like beautiful paintings.<br> - Like that one?<br> - Like that one.<br> Some people love beautiful flowers.<br> - Like those?<br> - Like those.<br> Now, I love beautiful little girls<br> like this one.<br> - You know what I'm going to do someday?<br> - What?<br> I'm going to take all the beautiful<br> little girls like you...<br> ...and I'm going to put them together<br> and make pictures with them.<br> - Will I be in a picture?<br> - Well, I should say you will.<br> But in the meantime, I think that<br> we ought to break our engagement.<br> - Why?<br> - Well, because...<br> ...there are going to be lots of boys...<br> ...who want to take you out<br> and buy you sodas.<br> If you're engaged to me,<br> you can't go with them.<br> - Why can't I?<br> - Because if you're married to me...<br> ...I'm not going to have you running around<br> with other boys. I couldn't stand for that.<br> - You couldn't?<br> - Well, of course I couldn't.<br> - Well, what are you laughing at?<br> - At you, you're jealous.<br> Well, you can just bet I'm jealous.<br> Well, now I've got to run along.<br> Florenz.<br> - Will you be home to dinner tonight?<br> - Yes, Dad.<br> Well, I'll see you then.<br> And in the meantime, son, remember:<br> Anything you do, I wish you luck.<br> I knew you would.<br> Hold it, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> Greetings. Greetings to San Francisco...<br> ...from my troupe, including the<br> strongest man in the world, Sandow.<br> Humane Society?<br> Say, what's this I read in the papers<br> about a lion and a bear?<br> Is your society going<br> to tolerate such an atrocity?<br> Are you going to spill the blood of animals<br> over the good name of San Francisco?<br> Well, I didn't think<br> you'd permit such cruelty.<br> Why, it would be a crime<br> to send a poor grizzly bear...<br> ...into a cage with<br> a man-eating lion. Crime.<br> - What's so funny?<br> - Oh, you wouldn't understand...<br> ...because you don't know Ziegfeld.<br> Police are after him...<br> ...and this paper's two weeks old,<br> so he's probably in jail by now.<br> - But do you know him, Jack?<br> - Oh, yeah, he's a pal of mine.<br> Hello.<br> - Well, Jack, this is a surprise.<br> - Yes.<br> - Certainly glad to see you aboard.<br> - Yes, well, I'm glad I--<br> Pardon me, I'll be back<br> in a few minutes, darling.<br> I thought perhaps you were--<br> - Hey, who is she?<br> - You'll never know.<br> What happened in Frisco? Did you<br> really send Sandow in against a lion?<br> Sure, but the lion wouldn't fight.<br> Wouldn't or couldn't?<br> To tell you the truth, Jack,<br> I didn't stay for the finish.<br> - I sort of thought that....<br> - Yes, I know.<br> Well, where is Sandow now?<br> He's in New York.<br> He's going into the legitimate.<br> - He's with Lillian Russell in As You Like It.<br> - Yeah, well, I don't think I'd like it.<br> What are you going to Europe for,<br> another strongman?<br> Oh, no, no. Just a little vacation.<br> - London?<br> - Well, Monte Carlo first.<br> You're gonna lose all the money<br> you made on Sandow, huh?<br> - No, I'm going to double it.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> What are you going for,<br> another Little Egypt?<br> Oh, no, just a rest. Of course, if I see<br> any exceptional talent, I'll pick it up.<br> Well, naturally. So will I.<br> Oh, you got anybody in mind?<br> No, no. Why, have you?<br> No, no.<br> Only the greatest artist<br> in Europe, that's all.<br> Say, who's that?<br> If I told you, you'd cross me<br> before we crossed the ocean.<br> Beg pardon, sir.<br> Miss Carlisle wishes to know whether<br> there will be three for tea or just two.<br> Just two. Yes, just two.<br> - Miss Carlisle, huh?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> You're....<br> - You're Mr. Billings' man, are you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Well, you're very efficient.<br> - What is your name?<br> - Sidney, sir.<br> Sidney. How much does<br> Mr. Billings pay you, Sidney?<br> One hundred a month, sir.<br> Only-- Well, that's not very much, is it?<br> I hadn't thought of it, sir.<br> Well, think of it, Sidney.<br> London Evening News.<br> London Evening News.<br> Oh, take care of the luggage, will you?<br> And tip the doorman, Sidney.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You have a reservation<br> for Florenz Ziegfeld Jr?<br> - Yes, sir. Will you register, please?<br> - Surely.<br> Is Mr. Billings still here?<br> - Yes, sir, on your floor.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Boy. Rooms 325 and 26.<br> Thank you.<br> Sidney. Well, you ingrate, you deserter--<br> Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.<br> Well, why didn't you tell me<br> you were dissatisfied? I--<br> - You pirate.<br> - Now wait a minute, Jack.<br> Gentlemen don't quarrel<br> over gentlemen's gentlemen.<br> - Oh, you--<br> - Let me tell you the whole story.<br> If you're still angry,<br> Sidney can go back with you.<br> - Oh, I--<br> - Look, Jack, it was this way.<br> I've always envied you.<br> Your dress, your style, the way you look.<br> So that when I saw your valet,<br> and I realized...<br> ...that it was he who took<br> such magnificent care of you...<br> ...well, I just couldn't resist the temptation<br> of hiring him for myself.<br> You mean, you wanted to look like me?<br> Well, that's right, Jack.<br> I wanted to look just like you.<br> You faker.<br> What are you doing here? I thought you<br> weren't going to be in London for weeks.<br> Well, that's a long story.<br> You know, I was going to break<br> the bank at Monte Carlo.<br> Yes, I know.<br> But the bank broke you, huh?<br> - What did you lose?<br> - Fifty-thousand dollars.<br> - What have you got left?<br> - Fifty cents.<br> Fifty cents. Well, I'll see you later.<br> But, Jack, wait a minute.<br> Lend me 5000, will you?<br> Well, would you--?<br> Would you make it 2500?<br> If I gave you $2500, by the time you<br> tipped six bellboys, you'd be broke again.<br> Look, Jack, I really need it.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> I'll give you $500 if you'll catch<br> the next boat back to New York.<br> There's one leaving in the morning.<br> Fair enough?<br> It's fair, but not enough.<br> Will you sail with me?<br> Oh, no, Mr. Ziegfeld,<br> I have business in London.<br> Oh, haven't you got<br> the world's greatest artist yet?<br> No, not yet, but I will have.<br> Who is it, Jack?<br> Go on, you can tell me now. I'm broke.<br> I won't tell you till I have<br> her name on the dotted line.<br> It's a her, is it?<br> Yes, and a beautiful her too,<br> and she's signing the contract tonight.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Billings.<br> I say, doorman,<br> did Mr. Billings come out?<br> Just this moment drove away.<br> I've got a very important message for him.<br> - Do you know where he went?<br> - Palace music hall.<br> - Is it a good show?<br> - Not so much, sir.<br> Except for the French actress.<br> She's truly wonderful.<br> She has eyes this big, sir.<br> Every time she blinks them at you,<br> you jolly well blink yourself, sir.<br> - Have you seen Anna Held, sir?<br> - No, no, I haven't, but I will tonight.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I say, sir, do you realize you gave me 5?<br> Yes, I'm trying to lose weight.<br> Isn't it magnificent?<br> For me, Marie?<br> From whom?<br> Whoever gathered all the orchids<br> in the world just for me?<br> I do not know, but they must've<br> cost thousands of francs.<br> Was no card with it? Oh, yes.<br> - Marie, this is very strange.<br> - What, madame?<br> I learned the English words, I sing the<br> English songs, yet I cannot read English.<br> What shall that mean?<br> Please read it to me.<br> "My dear Miss Held,<br> it is very important to your future...<br> ...that you see me<br> before signing any contracts.<br> I shall be waiting at the stage entrance<br> immediately after your performance.<br> Florenz Ziegfeld Jr."<br> - Who's this Florenz Ziegfeld Jr?<br> - I do not know, madame.<br> - And why is it junior? Is he a little boy?<br> - I do not know, madame.<br> I will not see this Mr. Ziegfeld Jr.<br> You will see Monsieur Billings, oui?<br> Oh, Marie, these flowers are very nice.<br> I think I am polite and see this<br> Monsieur Junior Ziegfeld.<br> But Billings is coming to talk to you<br> about the great American tour.<br> Has madame forgotten his cables?<br> Oh, yes, that's all right,<br> but these flowers are very beautiful.<br> Well, Jack, she's all right.<br> Yeah, I know she is<br> without you telling me.<br> - I wish you wouldn't keep following me.<br> - All right.<br> - Well, good night.<br> - Good night.<br> I wish you wouldn't annoy me.<br> Miss Held is expecting me.<br> - I'm going to sign the contract tonight.<br> - That's great.<br> - You bet it is.<br> - I said it was.<br> - Yes, well, good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Will you stop shadowing me?<br> I'm not following you.<br> I just happen to be going your way.<br> You've got a date with a chorus girl,<br> I suppose.<br> You're going to spend that $500.<br> I can't spend it. I've spent it.<br> - Oh, you've spent-- Well, good night.<br> - Good night.<br> I beg your pardon, sir, but--<br> I have an appointment with Miss Held.<br> - Is Mr. Ziegfeld out here?<br> - Oh, no--<br> Yes, my dear. I'm Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld, Miss Held<br> would like you to come in, please.<br> Would you mind that for me?<br> Well, good night, Jack.<br> Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld, your orchids. They are<br> the most beautiful orchids I have ever seen.<br> Won't you come in, Monsieur Ziegfeld?<br> Your flowers are so beautiful. I could<br> not resist the temptation to thank you.<br> Miss Held. Do you mind my telling you...<br> ...that you should never wear<br> so many jewels on your hands?<br> - You think so?<br> - Some women, yes.<br> But your hands, no.<br> Oh, that's a very nice compliment.<br> Did you hear that, Marie?<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> - Thank you.<br> I did not know Americans<br> could be so gallant.<br> Tell me, Monsieur Ziegfeld,<br> are you in the theater?<br> Yes, I'm a producer.<br> Did you hear that, Marie?<br> Monsieur Ziegfeld is an American producer.<br> Do you know Monsieur Billings?<br> Billings?<br> - Billings.<br> - He's American producer too.<br> Oh, is that so?<br> - No, I've never heard of him.<br> - No?<br> Of course, not in New York, that is.<br> America's a big country.<br> We still have producers in the West<br> putting on shows for the Indians.<br> - Indians? Do you mean the savages?<br> - Yes.<br> Did you hear that, Marie?<br> - I do not think I will like America.<br> - Oh, you'll love New York.<br> - Would New York love me?<br> - I think so.<br> You only think so?<br> Did you not like my performance?<br> Yes and no.<br> - Yes and no. Does it mean yes or no?<br> - Well, both.<br> - Did you not care for my singing, no?<br> - Yes.<br> A trifle nasal, I thought, but yes.<br> And you did not like my costumes either?<br> I thought one dress was<br> very effective, but the rest, no.<br> Monsieur Ziegfeld,<br> I think you are very rude.<br> Please go.<br> Marie, open the door.<br> Monsieur Ziegfeld.<br> Yes?<br> Come back, please.<br> Sit down.<br> You know, you are very honest.<br> I like you very much.<br> Your note says it is important to my future<br> to see you. Why is that?<br> - If you want to play in New York, it is.<br> - I have many offers for New York now.<br> I've no doubt, but so have many others.<br> There's foreign talent going<br> into New York every day.<br> - What happens to them?<br> - What?<br> Well, they open at Tony Pastor's theater,<br> and they get the hook.<br> The hook, what is that?<br> Hook, a little thing you catch fish with.<br> You know, a hook.<br> Now, if I take you over,<br> I'll present you on Broadway.<br> In a great show, in the best theater,<br> to the best people.<br> I'll exploit you from coast to coast.<br> Exploit? What is that?<br> I'll put you over, I'll sell you.<br> - Sell me?<br> - To the public.<br> And I'll make them pay for you.<br> And how much will you pay me?<br> I'll advertise your name<br> from every corner.<br> Women will be wearing Anna Held hats,<br> shoes, corsets.<br> Even the children will know you.<br> But how much will you pay me?<br> More publicity than<br> you've ever dreamed of.<br> Yes, that's all right.<br> But how much money will you give me?<br> I'll give you the greatest opening night<br> that New York has ever had.<br> You'll see the Goulds, the Astors,<br> the Vanderbilts.<br> "Diamond Jim" Brady, Lillian Russell.<br> - Lillian Russell?<br> - Yes.<br> - Oh, I would so much like to see her.<br> - Well.<br> No. First you must speak about the money<br> because I have so many offers now.<br> I'll meet your biggest offer.<br> Really?<br> Well, that is very nice of you.<br> But maybe when you hear how much it is,<br> you don't think I'm worth so much.<br> How much is it?<br> They are all very good, but the highest one<br> is that of Mr. Billings.<br> He says he will give me 50,000 francs<br> besides my salary, which is very big...<br> ...just to sign the contract. That is<br> how much in American money?<br> - $ 10,000, madame.<br> - $ 10,000, monsieur.<br> - Ten thousand dollars.<br> - Oui, that's a very big amount.<br> And even if you would give me<br> the $ 10,000 and I sign with you...<br> ...you still would have to wait<br> till I finished my London engagement.<br> I couldn't do that.<br> You couldn't even wait for me?<br> I couldn't even give you the $ 10,000.<br> - You think it's too much, huh?<br> - I think it isn't enough.<br> But I haven't it.<br> What, you expect I should sign a contract<br> for America with you...<br> - ...and you don't even have $ 10,000?<br> - I haven't even 1000.<br> I did have before I stopped at Monte Carlo,<br> but right now, I haven't even 100.<br> - But I'll spread your name all over--<br> - It is enough!<br> You're just trying<br> to make the fool of me.<br> You are the impostor.<br> You are no gentleman.<br> Please go.<br> Marie, open the door.<br> Monsieur Ziegfeld.<br> Come back, please.<br> Sit down.<br> You know, you're very honest.<br> I like you very much.<br> Mr. Vanderbilt's carriage.<br> Mr. Van Rensselaer's carriage.<br> - She has big eyes.<br> - But I couldn't understand a word she said.<br> - I'll take Lillian Russell.<br> - Mr. Astor's carriage.<br> - Did you like her?<br> - Cute. Did you notice the empty seats?<br> Miss Russell's carriage.<br> - I think she's charming.<br> - Why, there's Lillian Russell.<br> Mr. Thaw's carriage.<br> Never mind, I don't want a carriage.<br> The show's all right<br> if they had an American star.<br> Mrs. Harriman's carriage.<br> Mr. Stuyvesant's carriage.<br> You made a bad bet, Jim.<br> - May I have your carriage called, Mr. Brady?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, Ziggy.<br> Stanford and I just made a little wager.<br> He bet me 5000 that I wouldn't get back<br> the 10,000 you borrowed...<br> - ...to bring Anna over here.<br> - Mr. Brady's carriage.<br> I'll split your end 50-50<br> with you, Mr. White.<br> I told you so. I told you so.<br> Well, what's a few thousand<br> dollars anyway?<br> Mr. Chandler's carriage.<br> Mr. Saks' carriage.<br> Balcony 22.<br> Well, Sampston,<br> what's the loss this week?<br> The show earned a profit of $ 1340.32.<br> You drew $2550...<br> ...which gives us a loss of $ 1209.68.<br> That's terrible. We can't keep<br> the show running with losses.<br> - Say, where's Sage?<br> - Upstairs.<br> What a press agent, never around.<br> Take a wire to him.<br> - But he's just upstairs in his office.<br> - I know it. Take a wire anyway.<br> How can you do business<br> without publicity? Stop.<br> Anna Held was the sensation<br> of Europe. Stop.<br> Appeared before kings<br> and queens. Stop.<br> Yet you get nothing<br> in the papers. Stop.<br> You're ruining me. Stop.<br> If you're a press agent,<br> I'm President Cleveland.<br> Stop.<br> Beg your pardon.<br> Pardon, madame.<br> It is not jolie. It is jolly.<br> Jolie, that's what I said, jolie.<br> Pardon, it's my mistake. I mean jolly.<br> Jolly. Good.<br> Please, let's start again. Jolly.<br> No, no, no. I won't sing today.<br> I can't sing today.<br> I'm much too much inside here.<br> Much too much.<br> Marie?<br> Marie.<br> It's so silly for Anna Held<br> to take singing lessons.<br> But Ziegfeld did not ask me to teach you.<br> I simply want to help madame<br> to lose her French accent.<br> But your accent is much more than my<br> accent, and I don't want to lose my accent.<br> Marie, did you try to get<br> Monsieur Ziegfeld again?<br> - He is not home, madame.<br> - Please try it again.<br> - And the reporters?<br> - They are still in the lobby.<br> Tell them to go away.<br> Tell the hotel to push them out.<br> Tell them we are going back to France.<br> That's what we will do.<br> We are going back to Paris.<br> - Shut up, Pierre.<br> - I'm too happy, madame.<br> - Happy about what?<br> - We are sailing for Paris.<br> - No.<br> - No?<br> No, I changed my mind.<br> Marie, go unpack my things.<br> - You see, it's true.<br> - It is not.<br> - It is.<br> - No.<br> What is true and what is not true?<br> Pierre says madame is in love<br> with Monsieur Ziegfeld.<br> Did you say that, Pierre?<br> - Why did you say that, Pierre?<br> - Because I'm afraid it's true.<br> Why are you afraid?<br> Don't you like Monsieur Ziegfeld?<br> Oui, madame, that's the trouble.<br> Everybody likes him,<br> especially the ladies.<br> Oh, madame, you'd never<br> be happy with him.<br> You'd never be able to hold him.<br> Why, he attracts women<br> like the flowers attract bees.<br> Like the flypaper attract the flies.<br> Well, that's all right.<br> I've seen the flies on the flypaper...<br> ...and it seems to me<br> they stick very well.<br> - But, madame--<br> - Pierre, please.<br> How can I love someone who puts<br> terrible things in the newspaper...<br> ...has millions of reporters annoying me?<br> Pardon, madame, but the newspapers<br> have been very nice to you.<br> Why don't you want to see the reporters?<br> Because I know exactly<br> what they want to ask me.<br> - You do not understand, no?<br> - Frankly, no, madame.<br> Oh, then I will tell you what happened.<br> Two months ago,<br> Monsieur Ziegfeld says:<br> "Anna, from now on, I'm going<br> to send you, every day, a big present."<br> I say, "Thank you so much, Flo--"<br> I mean, "Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> But already you send me orchids<br> every morning."<br> Those are from him.<br> But he says, "No, Anna, this is something<br> much more important."<br> So naturally, I cannot wait to see<br> what he sends me.<br> And the next day,<br> what do you think I get?<br> - A diamond ring?<br> - No.<br> - A bracelet?<br> - No. Four big cans of milk.<br> - Milk.<br> - Twenty gallons.<br> - Twenty gallons of milk?<br> - Twenty gallons of milk.<br> - Shut up!<br> - Twenty gallons of milk.<br> - Oh, please.<br> - No.<br> I'm so sorry. Excuse me.<br> Well, that night I say to Flo--<br> I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld:<br> "Flo, why do you send me<br> so much milk?"<br> And he just laughs and says,<br> "Anna, that's a great idea.<br> You get it from now on every day."<br> "Every day, 20 gallons of milk?"<br> I say, "Flo, who can drink so much milk?"<br> And do you know what he says?<br> "Don't drink it, bathe in it.<br> And you will be a big success."<br> - No!<br> - Well, I'm too angry to speak.<br> In Paris, I was a big success<br> because they liked my voice.<br> In London,<br> because they liked my singing.<br> But in America, to be a big success,<br> I need 20 gallons of milk and must sit in it!<br> - Well, do you bathe in it, madame?<br> - No, of course not.<br> But every day, we get the milk<br> and take it in...<br> ...because Monsieur Ziegfeld says<br> we must carry out his idea.<br> And what happened?<br> Did you read this morning, the paper?<br> - No, madame.<br> - Please.<br> - "Ziegfeld is sued for Anna Held's milk bill."<br> - On the front page.<br> - Twenty gallons of milk.<br> - Oh, I'm so ashamed.<br> Marie, please call him again.<br> If he's not there, leave the message.<br> Tell him I do not want<br> one can more of milk from him.<br> And I don't want the orchids either.<br> - Hello?<br> - Oh, those reporters again.<br> Tell them no.<br> I do not want to speak to them.<br> Madame, it is Monsieur Ziegfeld.<br> I don't want to speak to him either.<br> I never wish to speak to him again.<br> Where is he?<br> Downstairs in the lobby, madame.<br> Tell him to come up.<br> But if he brings one of those reporters,<br> don't let him in.<br> No, Pierre. Let them on the floor.<br> I want him to see them there.<br> I make him pick them up.<br> He embarrasses me, I embarrass him.<br> Madame, if you will take my advice,<br> you will not appear so excited.<br> Yes, you are right, Pierre.<br> Pierre, play. Play. I sing for you, yes.<br> Just like he's not here.<br> We'll let him wait till I'm finished.<br> Come on, play, play, play.<br> - Your missus is in lovely voice today, Marie.<br> - Oui, monsieur. You will see.<br> Marie, someone has apparently<br> spilled the orchids.<br> Now, will you phone Sidney for me? Have<br> him send up another dozen immediately.<br> Well? Why do you not pick these up?<br> Because fallen flowers, my dear,<br> are like fallen stars.<br> They soon lose their luster.<br> Marie, pick them up.<br> No, I cannot sing today.<br> I'm much too angry to sing.<br> I'm sick of watching you<br> roll your eyes like I do.<br> Please go home. I give you your notes.<br> Please take them. Go home, yes?<br> Go.<br> So I'm a fallen star, yes?<br> I have no luster, no?<br> Oh, yes, you have, my dear.<br> - But do you know what it comes from?<br> - I don't care.<br> What?<br> Milk baths. Or at least that's what<br> you must tell the reporters.<br> I'm so hurt. The front page of the paper<br> says you are sued on my account.<br> If you send milk,<br> why don't you pay for it?<br> If I did, it wouldn't be in the papers.<br> Can't you tell them I just used the milk<br> without buying it and being sued for it?<br> They wouldn't believe it.<br> Now it's a matter of record.<br> Besides, they don't care<br> whether I ever pay the bill.<br> All that interests them is that in two<br> months, you've used 1200 gallons of milk.<br> This is terrible.<br> - Ask the reporters to come up.<br> - Do nothing of the kind.<br> Anna, you must not insult the press.<br> If they come up, I tell the truth.<br> No, at first, tell them nothing.<br> Desk, please.<br> Pretend embarrassment.<br> Pretend it? I was never so ashamed.<br> Are the gentlemen of the press<br> still waiting for Miss Held?<br> What are you doing?<br> Oh, yes, if you will, please.<br> I will say I never in my life<br> took a milk bath.<br> I will tell them it is all a press story.<br> I will go back to France.<br> Marie, pack the things. Quick.<br> This time I mean it!<br> You cannot make a circus of me.<br> I'm not a strongman like Sandow.<br> I'm a real artist,<br> and I never, never, never will say that.<br> Yes? Oh, ask them<br> to come right up, please.<br> No!<br> Anna, don't you realize<br> that if we put this story over...<br> ...your name will be in headlines<br> from coast to coast?<br> Every woman in the country will be<br> talking about you.<br> I don't care.<br> I do not have to be a cow<br> to be a success.<br> And before I make such a fool of myself,<br> I tear up my contract with you. So...<br> ...where is it?<br> And besides-- Besides--<br> And besides, you do nothing<br> as I like to have it.<br> It must always be your way.<br> I ask you 1000 times<br> to have costumes like Lillian Russell.<br> She has not to take milk baths<br> to be a success. She is beautiful.<br> But, no, I cannot have gowns like her.<br> There now.<br> Tell the reporters about that!<br> - Anna.<br> - I mean it. I'm determined.<br> Anna.<br> You let the reporters come up, yes?<br> All right, I tell them everything.<br> Anna?<br> Well, I should tell them, no?<br> No.<br> Now, you do what I ask you to, darling...<br> ...and I'll do whatever you wish.<br> You mean, you'll let me have<br> gowns like Lillian Russell?<br> Oh, no, darling.<br> You're not her type.<br> - But I'll tell you what I will do.<br> - What?<br> I'll put eight Lillian Russells<br> on the stage behind you.<br> Isn't Anna beautiful?<br> I wonder if the milk baths<br> really make her skin so nice.<br> Oh, they most certainly do.<br> I've been taking them for a long time.<br> Oh, Marie, were they not<br> wonderful tonight?<br> And the girls!<br> Don't they look gorgeous?<br> Marie.<br> Look. From my Flo.<br> Oh, my Flo.<br> Oh, Marie! Marie!<br> You read what he says.<br> Oui, madame.<br> Read it to me, quick!<br> What does it say?<br> "My darling.<br> I never knew that one long year<br> could seem like one short moment.<br> You are magnificent, my wife. Flo."<br> Oh, Marie.<br> - Marie, did you hear that?<br> - I just read it, madame.<br> No, no. Did you hear what he says?<br> "You are magnificent, my wife."<br> Oh, madame, look! Look!<br> Marie!<br> Come on, help me.<br> Oh, isn't it gorgeous?<br> Oh, madame, look, look!<br> Here's another one!<br> Oh, Marie!<br> Oh, that makes me<br> so much inside. Here.<br> Much too much.<br> First, he gives me all<br> the flowers in the world...<br> ...and now he takes the stars<br> from the heavens, just for me.<br> "You're magnificent, my wife."<br> - Am I magnificent, Marie?<br> - Oui, madame.<br> No, no, no.<br> He's magnificent, not I.<br> Marie!<br> Marie, I must show them to the girls!<br> I come back immediately!<br> And when Mr. Ziegfeld comes,<br> please tell him he shall wait!<br> Girls, would you like to see<br> something wonderful?<br> Oh, what is it?<br> - Look! And this!<br> - Diamonds!<br> - From my husband!<br> - May I try the bracelet?<br> - Yes, sure.<br> - That's gorgeous.<br> Audrey, are you not interested<br> in my presents?<br> I would be if they were mine.<br> But, Audrey, you will have<br> many of them someday.<br> Maybe you have to work a little,<br> to suffer a little.<br> - But what is that?<br> - I'll work, but I won't suffer.<br> - Here you are, dear.<br> - Thank you.<br> Isn't it beautiful, Audrey?<br> I'll say it is.<br> I'd give my soul for one like it.<br> That would be a very<br> bad bargain, Audrey.<br> All right, that's fine! Tie it off!<br> You're better with your feet<br> than your broom.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld, you think so?<br> I wish you'd give me a chance.<br> I've got talent.<br> I'd like to get away from shifting<br> scenery and moving props.<br> - How long have you been a property boy?<br> - Five years. But my heart hasn't been in it.<br> You've been working a long time<br> without your heart.<br> - That tickle you?<br> - It does.<br> And this weekly return tickles me more.<br> Look, a profit of $5000.<br> If you'll just be conservative,<br> I mean, live reasonably.<br> Don't incur any fresh obligations,<br> forget you have charge accounts...<br> - ...and you'll soon--<br> - You're right.<br> - I will.<br> - Darling!<br> Oh, Anna.<br> Anna.<br> You're the sweetest husband<br> in the whole world.<br> Mr. Sampston!<br> Look.<br> From my husband.<br> On our anniversary.<br> This and this.<br> Are they not gorgeous diamonds?<br> Yes, indeed, Miss Held, gorgeous.<br> Good night, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Good night, Sampston.<br> He didn't seem very happy<br> about my presents, oui?<br> Anna, men who keep books<br> are never very happy.<br> Marie, you go out for a while.<br> He is my maid tonight. Go, go, go, go.<br> - Oh, I am, am I?<br> - Yes, you are.<br> Later, I count the diamonds in the bracelet<br> and necklace and kiss you for each one.<br> What about the orchids?<br> Don't I get anything for them?<br> For each petal of each orchid,<br> another kiss extra. So....<br> Take off my stocking, please.<br> You know, this might get to be a habit.<br> Flo, you're wonderful.<br> Do you know that?<br> I suspect it.<br> Everything you promise me, you do.<br> Everything you say will happen, happens.<br> And now I am a big success<br> in America, thanks to you.<br> Flo!<br> Why do you do that when I am<br> trying to say nice things to you?<br> Besides, you're<br> a very bad mate.<br> But I love you.<br> - Flo?<br> - What?<br> Flo, are you as happy as I am?<br> Happier. Why do you ask?<br> Because sometimes<br> I think I am too happy.<br> Sometimes I get afraid<br> it won't be always like this...<br> ...working only for you<br> while you do the show just for me.<br> Couldn't I do another show<br> without spoiling our happiness?<br> Of course you could. Don't be silly.<br> Do you want to do another show?<br> Well, darling, now that you've<br> made such a tremendous success...<br> ...I have a little idea<br> that I'd like to carry out.<br> Idea for a show?<br> - The biggest kind of a show.<br> - With music and girls?<br> - Beautiful girls and--<br> - And without me, oui?<br> Well, darling, you couldn't do<br> two shows at once, could you?<br> Now, Anna, see here.<br> Suppose we go down to Rector's<br> and celebrate our anniversary?<br> - No, I don't--<br> - Just us and a bottle of wine.<br> - I don't feel like it.<br> - Come on, now, dear.<br> - No, I'm so nervous.<br> - It'll be good for you.<br> I'm so tired.<br> I'm so disappointed in you<br> I could scream!<br> - Now, Anna--<br> - I mean it.<br> I thought you loved me more<br> than anything in the world.<br> I thought I am your one ideal,<br> your only ambition.<br> - Anna--<br> - No.<br> I think only of you, and I thought<br> you will only think of me.<br> But it is not so.<br> You have big plans without me.<br> You will do a big show.<br> You will go broke again!<br> Anna, you're jealous.<br> - No, Flo!<br> - Yes.<br> Don't say that, no, no, no!<br> I hate jealous people,<br> and I don't know what's....<br> I'm angry, and I wish you would go.<br> Please, please.<br> Please go. Go! Go!<br> Marie!<br> Marie.<br> Flo.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Billings.<br> - Good morning, Miss Drake. Messages?<br> Nothing important, except Mr. Erlanger<br> wants to see you today.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld is in your office.<br> Well, why in my office<br> instead of out here?<br> I thought he'd be more<br> comfortable in there.<br> Well, I-- Oh yes, I see.<br> To what do I owe the honor<br> of this visit, Mr. Ziegfeld?<br> Mr. Billings, if you've ever had it in for me,<br> you've certainly avenged yourself.<br> This is positively the worst cigar I've ever<br> smoked in my life. How are you, Jack?<br> - All right. How are you?<br> - Never better. Sit, won't you?<br> Thank you. Nice of you.<br> I'm here to do you a great favor.<br> I'm sorry, I can't take advantage of it.<br> I'm broke.<br> That's why I'm hooked up<br> with Erlanger.<br> Oh, well, that's fine for me.<br> He's just the man I need.<br> Jack, I want to do a new show,<br> a big show.<br> I'm willing to split it 50-50 with Erlanger,<br> and all he has to do is put up the money...<br> - ...and furnish the theaters.<br> - Oh, that's all?<br> That's all.<br> Of course, you'd furnish the star.<br> Oh, this isn't for Anna.<br> Anna's show is all set.<br> No, in this one...<br> - ...I want to star the girls.<br> - Don't be ridiculous.<br> Without personalities,<br> you haven't got a chance.<br> I'll have personalities, all right,<br> Iots of them.<br> But they'll mostly be<br> blonds and brunettes.<br> What are you going to call this opera?<br> I'm going to call it<br> the Ziegfeld Follies.<br> Follies. Follies, all right.<br> What's the matter?<br> That's a good title.<br> What's so unusual about a girl show?<br> We've got plenty now.<br> I don't mean that kind.<br> They're way out-of-date.<br> You're using the same scenery you used<br> I want to do a show with silk drapes,<br> with lace, with beautiful girls.<br> I won't dress them<br> for the men in the front...<br> ...but for the women in the back.<br> I want to surround them with<br> glamour, glitter. Glorify them.<br> Say....<br> There's a good word, Jack. "Glorify."<br> Sounds all right<br> if you know what it means.<br> It'll look all right too.<br> "Glorifying the American Girl."<br> Where you gonna find<br> these beautiful girls?<br> I'll take them from homes,<br> from stores, from shops--<br> From offices.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Mr. Erlanger would like to see you now.<br> Oh, all right.<br> - Yes, well, that'll do, Miss Drake.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Now, listen, Ziggy, not her.<br> She's the best stenographer I ever had.<br> - All right, Jack.<br> - Here, here.<br> - You will buzz the little giant?<br> - I'll tell him...<br> - ...but I doubt he'll be interested.<br> - He's missing a great opportunity.<br> Yes, I know.<br> But, well, I'll drop you a line about it.<br> Perhaps tomorrow.<br> Wire me, will you?<br> Well, if you'd rather hear<br> the sad news sooner, I'll wire.<br> Yes.<br> What's that? They won't give us<br> our share of the profits?<br> All right! Open him in Boston...<br> ...jump him to New Orleans,<br> and then on to Frisco.<br> Funny thing, Billings.<br> You just can't be nice to some people.<br> Yes, that's what I was thinking.<br> Ziegfeld was just here.<br> What did he want?<br> Remember when he stole Anna Held<br> right from under my nose?<br> Then, so I couldn't get her back,<br> he married her and made enough to retire.<br> Now he comes back, broke again...<br> ...asking me to ask you for the money<br> to put on a new show!<br> Well, that's nerve.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Give him the money.<br> - Cantor and Will Rogers!<br> - $50 a pair!<br> - Best show in town!<br> - Tickets, boys? And gentlemen?<br> Standing room only.<br> Come on, girls, come on, come on!<br> Get up those steps! Come on!<br> You realize this is opening night?<br> You take that brace and put it down here!<br> What is it?<br> I've only got two minutes.<br> You ready to go in with those steps?<br> I've built so many steps for Ziegfeld,<br> they go in by themselves.<br> - What follows this number?<br> - The--<br> I know, Greg Williams.<br> Have the finale costumes arrived?<br> Mr. Sampston's talking<br> to the costumer now.<br> Oh, I see. Trouble again.<br> You can't do this!<br> It's an unheard-of procedure!<br> I'm very sorry, Mr. Sampston,<br> I want my money.<br> It's preposterous! Ridiculous!<br> - No money, no finale costumes.<br> - It's a holdup! Oh, hello.<br> You can't do this to Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Wait here a minute.<br> - Allen!<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Where's Ziegfeld?<br> - Haven't seen him in 10 minutes.<br> - See if he's in the front.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> No, no, I'll go.<br> No, no, you go.<br> - No, no, send somebody else.<br> - Yes, sir. Joe!<br> Tell him I must see him immediately.<br> The show depends on it.<br> This is going to be the death of me.<br> This is awful.<br> Wait here for me. You will wait?<br> You bet I will.<br> Yes?<br> - Hello, Sam. How are y'all?<br> - Mr. Rogers?<br> You look kind of worried.<br> What's on your mind, Sam?<br> I was looking for Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Just a minute, Sam.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld, it's very important.<br> The costumer's--<br> Will, the audiences love<br> to hear you talk.<br> Well, shucks, Flo.<br> I can't talk any more than I do.<br> Gotta get the rope tricks in, don't I?<br> I think they like to hear<br> your wisecracks better.<br> Perhaps they do, but what will I talk about?<br> I ain't got anything to say that's funny.<br> - Mr. Ziegfeld--<br> - Now wait a minute, Sam.<br> Your wife tells me you keep<br> her laughing all the time...<br> ...just about things<br> you read in the papers.<br> I catch on. Betty's been putting<br> you up to this, huh?<br> Well, I got a sort of a habit of telling her<br> all I know is what I read in the papers...<br> ...and she says that's what I ought<br> to tell the audience.<br> Just sort of be kind<br> of a running gag item.<br> - She's right.<br> - Oh, sure, Betty's always right.<br> But she don't have to stand on the stage<br> and catch those overripe tomatoes...<br> - ...if the gag don't work.<br> - Mr. Ziegfeld, I must interrupt you.<br> - The finale costumes are here.<br> - Oh, good.<br> - Will you do it?<br> - I might.<br> - They won't leave without the money.<br> - Give them a check.<br> - Will you do it tonight?<br> - They want the cash.<br> They sent the costumes<br> for this show COD?<br> No, sir, not this show.<br> They want some money on the last show.<br> Reckon you got your shows mixed up?<br> Well, I reckon. A little.<br> If I can help you out on anything,<br> why, let me know.<br> Thanks, Bill. I'm all right.<br> Well, tell me if I can.<br> Of course, I don't suppose it makes<br> a lot of difference, because...<br> ...even with the costumes on,<br> girls in this show...<br> ...ain't exactly overdressed.<br> You save your wisecracks<br> for the audience, Bill.<br> - Hey, buddy! Hey!<br> - Yes?<br> Your opening night, your big chance,<br> and you're still moving scenery?<br> I can't help it, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> It gets in the blood.<br> Besides, I don't know how<br> I'm gonna go over tonight.<br> I don't wanna lose a job<br> till I'm sure of the other.<br> When I hired you as an actor,<br> I fired you as a stagehand.<br> Better make good.<br> You'll find yourself without any job.<br> - Well, what seems to be the trouble?<br> - No trouble, I hope, except--<br> Except he's holding us up!<br> - He refuses to leave the costumes unless--<br> - Unless he gets some money, and he's right.<br> Let me see them first.<br> At once, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Open up the basket.<br> I tell you, Mr. Ziegfeld,<br> these dresses are wonderful.<br> The finest work I have ever done.<br> Look, Mr. Ziegfeld, isn't it stunning?<br> Perhaps you made a mistake.<br> This isn't for me.<br> Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld, for the finale.<br> Not my finale.<br> Mr. Schutz, this is the<br> New Amsterdam Theatre.<br> This is the Follies.<br> I know, Mr. Ziegfeld,<br> and this is the costume for the finale.<br> Well, not for my show.<br> Why, I couldn't let my girls appear<br> in a thing like that. That's horrible!<br> Oh, take it away.<br> But, Mr. Ziegfeld, they were made from<br> the sketches of your own designer.<br> You yourself made the changes on<br> the sketches when you gave me the order.<br> I never ordered that. That's terrible!<br> Take it away, take it out of my theater!<br> But, Mr. Ziegfeld, I worked over<br> three weeks on these dresses.<br> I have plenty of money<br> invested in them.<br> I'm sorry, but I can't help that.<br> What do you want to do? Disgrace me?<br> No, no, Mr. Ziegfeld. But please<br> do not disgrace me.<br> I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld, please<br> let your girls wear my costumes tonight.<br> No, I wouldn't humiliate them.<br> If you aren't satisfied, I'll make it up to you,<br> but please don't make me take them back.<br> All right, but just this once.<br> Send them up to the dressing rooms.<br> See me in my office next week.<br> - Next month.<br> - Next month.<br> Thank you very much, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> - They are beautiful, aren't they?<br> - Awfully expensive.<br> All right, girls,<br> places for the melody number!<br> He's singing very well<br> tonight, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> He's all right,<br> but there's too much white.<br> Merv, he's too white.<br> Bring up the pink in your footlights.<br> Are the steps high enough<br> for you this time, Mr. Ziegfeld?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> We could use more, a lot more.<br> - I'd like to see them higher.<br> - How's that, Mr. Ziegfeld?<br> That's perfect now.<br> Keep it that way the rest of the number.<br> Ain't that something?<br> Don't you like your flowers, honey lamb?<br> - They're beautiful. Was there a card?<br> - Oh, sure. Here it is.<br> And there was a package too.<br> I done unwrapped it for you.<br> - You've done looked at it too, I suppose.<br> - Oh, no, honey lamb, I never.<br> - Pour me a drink, Flossie.<br> - Another? Ain't you all forgetting...<br> ...you got a midnight show to do<br> on the roof tonight?<br> And ain't you all forgetting<br> to pour that drink?<br> Well, scratch my back, honey.<br> Is them diamonds, or is them stars?<br> - Who sent them to you, honey lamb?<br> - Who do you think?<br> I know.<br> They's from Mr. Zieg--<br> - Here he is.<br> - Tell him to come in.<br> Yes'm.<br> Audrey.<br> - You were beautiful tonight.<br> - Thank you.<br> Flossie, pour us a drink.<br> No, no, no, please, dear, no.<br> I just came to tell you--<br> Somebody else thought<br> you were beautiful too, oui?<br> From an old friend.<br> Not too old, I hope.<br> What a beautiful bracelet, Audrey.<br> Is this from your old friend too?<br> - Do you like it?<br> - Yes, it's charming!<br> You know, your friend<br> must have very good taste...<br> ...because this is just the sort<br> of jewelry Flo would like.<br> I told you someday<br> you will have lots of diamonds, didn't I?<br> Yes, you did.<br> And I told you<br> I wouldn't suffer, remember?<br> Yes...<br> ...I do.<br> Well, congratulations again, Audrey.<br> I'll see you later.<br> On the roof, oui?<br> She's really quite beautiful, Flo, oui?<br> - Yes, she is, isn't she?<br> - You're very much interested in her, oui?<br> I'm interested in all my girls, dear.<br> But maybe a tiny, little bit more<br> in her, oui?<br> A lot more.<br> - She's very unusual.<br> - Yes.<br> I could make a great star out of her,<br> if she'd only let me.<br> Ladies and gentlemen!<br> On behalf of the rest of the company,<br> I've been asked to make a little speech.<br> Well, you see,<br> I have a confession to make.<br> Little Audrey is a wee bit tight tonight.<br> No, but seriously,<br> you really shouldn't applaud all of us...<br> ...because everything we've done<br> we owe to Flo.<br> You see, I was just a little chorus girl<br> when Flo discovered me.<br> He taught me how to walk<br> and how to dress...<br> ...and how to smile.<br> So....<br> Well....<br> Here's to Flo.<br> I am afraid you must forgive<br> Miss Lane tonight.<br> She just passed through many weeks<br> of very tedious rehearsals.<br> And the nervous strain of an opening night.<br> She's not really herself.<br> On behalf of my company,<br> I want to thank you.<br> You've been very kind<br> to my girls and my stars.<br> And speaking of stars...<br> ...there's a young lady here tonight<br> who, in my opinion...<br> ...is destined to reach<br> the top of her profession.<br> She doesn't work for me,<br> I'm sorry to say...<br> ...but I'm very proud of her. She's here<br> tonight with her producer, lucky fellow.<br> And if she will, I'm going to ask<br> Sally Manners to take a bow.<br> Sally Manners.<br> Nice of him to pay my star<br> a tribute, isn't it?<br> Yes, it is. I hope you've got her<br> on a long contract.<br> - Are you ready, Mr. Ziegfeld?<br> - All ready.<br> Now, you'll be signing the contract<br> but look in the camera.<br> The picture wouldn't be right<br> without the Manners smile.<br> All right?<br> All right, shoot!<br> Those things horrify me.<br> - I think we're both to be congratulated.<br> - I feel it's a great opportunity.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Sage, if you'll take Miss Manners...<br> ...and the boys into your office,<br> I'm sure she'll have things to say.<br> - I could tell them how happy I am now.<br> - May I congratulate you?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Right this way, Miss Manners.<br> - Ms. Manners....<br> - Come along now, boys.<br> - Where's that girl you said was my friend?<br> - Here I am.<br> I didn't want to disturb you.<br> You told them out there<br> that you were a friend of mine, huh?<br> Yes, I did.<br> Well, I see.<br> Just to get into my office, huh?<br> - Smart girl.<br> - Well, I am a friend of yours.<br> Have you forgotten me?<br> No, no, of course not. I....<br> I remember you very well.<br> Who am I?<br> - As if I didn't know.<br> - Do you?<br> Of course. I always remember<br> the time, the place and the girl.<br> It was....<br> - Atlantic City.<br> - Nope.<br> - No?<br> - No.<br> Well, that's funny. I seem to remember<br> a chair on a boardwalk...<br> ...you beside me and....<br> Are you sure it wasn't Atlantic City?<br> It might have been Atlantic City,<br> but it wasn't me.<br> Now I remember!<br> Why, it was right here in this office.<br> You came up to see me about a year ago.<br> Oh, now it all comes back to me.<br> Well, how are you?<br> Where have you been?<br> No.<br> - No?<br> - No. You don't seem to remember...<br> ...the time, the place or the girl.<br> Well....<br> Perhaps this will help you.<br> Mary Lou!<br> Well, how's my girl?<br> How's my fella?<br> Well, my little Mary Lou<br> is a big girl now, isn't she?<br> Yes!<br> Yes, indeed, a very big girl.<br> - Aren't you glad to see me?<br> - Yes, I certainly am!<br> Even if I wasn't at Atlantic City<br> with you?<br> Don't be silly.<br> I knew you all the time.<br> Now, fibber....<br> - Well, how long you been in New York?<br> - One day.<br> - One day. You seen my father lately?<br> - Yes, just before I left.<br> Oh, that reminds me,<br> he told me to give you a big kiss.<br> Well.<br> You know, I think that in all fairness...<br> - ...I should tell you I am a married man now.<br> - Yes, I know. I read about it.<br> It nearly broke my heart.<br> But being married in New York<br> doesn't mean anything, does it?<br> Oh, yes, it does, young lady.<br> Now, why are you here,<br> and what can I do for you?<br> Well, first of all, I want to give you<br> a big kiss for all the candy you sent me.<br> You've already done that twice.<br> Now, what else?<br> - Well, I want to go into the Follies.<br> - You do?<br> - I've been taking dancing lessons two years.<br> - Yeah?<br> - How do your father and mother feel?<br> - I haven't a father and mother anymore.<br> I'm so sorry, my dear.<br> Of course, Jimmy won't like it.<br> - Who's Jimmy?<br> - Just another fellow I've been engaged to.<br> Oh, well....<br> - All right, I think we can look after you.<br> - Do you think we can have dinner tonight?<br> Well, no, no, I'm afraid we can't.<br> - Oh, Alice!<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Take this lady down to the stage and tell<br> Julian to put her on as an extra dancer.<br> - For the time being.<br> - Oh, gee, thank you!<br> Mary Lou is an old friend of mine<br> from Chicago, and she's a stranger here.<br> - So I'd like you to sort of look after her.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - This way, dear.<br> - Oh, may I say one thing before I go?<br> - Well, yes, of course. What?<br> - I forgive you for not marrying me.<br> - All right. Goodbye, dear.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Hello. Pardon me. Hello, Alice.<br> - Say, Flo!<br> I know! You got a new song.<br> I'll say we have.<br> Play him the melody, Danny.<br> Oh, you'll go crazy over this, Flo.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> I must interrupt you.<br> This is important.<br> - I got an idea.<br> - How much will it save?<br> - This has nothing to do with money.<br> - Feeling all right?<br> My usual headache,<br> but this is about talent.<br> - Good and cheap, no doubt?<br> - Exactly. A young lady, the name of Brice.<br> - Fannie Brice.

Depend on her now.<br> Go on, star her.<br> Do anything you like with her.<br> I hate you!<br> I'm never gonna see you again.<br> I'm quitting you and your show.<br> I hope you don't get the money to open it.<br> And if you do, I hope it's a flop!<br> That's how I feel about you!<br> And this is how I feel<br> about your elephant!<br> - Sidney?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Take a wire to Mr. Billings.<br> Will that be all, Mr. Billings?<br> Yes, that'll be all, thank you.<br> - Miss Jones, take care of that right away.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I got another telegram from Ziegfeld.<br> He can't open his show unless we help him.<br> We won't help him.<br> I told him so yesterday.<br> I'm not interested,<br> and I won't loan him 5 cents.<br> - Send him a wire--<br> - I just did.<br> - Did what?<br> - Wired him the money.<br> Isn't that Mr. Ziegfeld?<br> Say, Flo, why don't you go<br> put on the costume...<br> - ...and get into the spirit of the dance.<br> - I'm tired, Gene.<br> Come on, Flo.<br> Don't lose interest in everything.<br> No, I'm going home.<br> Good night.<br> - Let me have that megaphone, honey.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Willie.<br> - Flo, you're not leaving.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - We're starting a Paul Jones inside...<br> ...and I promise whenever you get<br> a pretty girl, I'll blow the whistle.<br> Not tonight, Willie.<br> Say, who is that girl<br> with the gorgeous red hair?<br> Why, that's Billie Burke.<br> Thanks, Willie.<br> - Good evening, Jack.<br> - How do you do? Come on.<br> Willie.<br> - Yes, Flo?<br> - I'm staying for the Paul Jones.<br> Whenever you see me with Miss Burke,<br> blow the whistle.<br> Okay.<br> Take your places for the Paul Jones,<br> everybody.<br> The Paul Jones!<br> - Well, do you think we ought to? I--<br> - Oh, yes. I love the Paul Jones.<br> - Perhaps we could both go the same way.<br> - No, we can't do that!<br> Oh, Well, I....<br> Miss Burke.<br> Mister...?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> Oh, no, I'm supposed to--<br> I've got to-- We're not--<br> - Oh, no, this is our dance.<br> - Oh, is it?<br> - Miss Burke.<br> - We meet again, Mister...?<br> It still doesn't matter.<br> Won't you tell me?<br> - Tell you what?<br> - Your name.<br> - Why don't you ask Mr. Billings.<br> - I will, if I can find him.<br> But you seem to stand in<br> with the whistle.<br> Oh, yes, when I was a little boy,<br> I used to love to whistle...<br> ...and a whistle never forgets.<br> - Aren't you getting bored?<br> - No. Are you?<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> - Tired?<br> - Are you?<br> - No, but I'd much rather just talk.<br> - Would you mind?<br> - No.<br> Don't you love the lights of New York?<br> For me, they're more beautiful<br> than any landscape.<br> - More beautiful than the mountains?<br> - Yes, I think so.<br> - Are you too cold out here?<br> - No, indeed. I'm enjoying it.<br> That is, I....<br> I mean, the electric signs fascinate me.<br> "Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Fleischmann's<br> Yeast, Ziegfeld's Follies."<br> - Do you know Ziegfeld?<br> - No, I don't want to.<br> - I understand he's a horrible person.<br> - Horrible?<br> Yes, they say he's a terrible lady's man.<br> Well, I suppose that's forgivable.<br> He's surrounded by so many<br> beautiful women.<br> Yes, yes.<br> Strange you've never met him.<br> I don't want to. I love his shows.<br> They're so beautiful and in such good taste.<br> It would disappoint me to meet him...<br> ...and find him to be a fat, pudgy man<br> with a big stomach.<br> He's not fat<br> and not really so pudgy.<br> - No? You know him?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Yes. He would like you.<br> - How do you know?<br> - Didn't you just say he had good taste?<br> Well, you're sort of a lady's man yourself,<br> aren't you?<br> I think with you as the lady,<br> I could make Ziegfeld look like an amateur.<br> - You haven't told me your name yet.<br> - If you don't mind, Mr. Ziegfeld...<br> ...Miss Burke, with the permission<br> of her producer...<br> ...came here with me tonight.<br> And if you've no objection,<br> I'd like to have one dance.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld? Well, you were right.<br> He isn't pudgy.<br> - Shall we go in?<br> - Yes!<br> - Don't I get one more dance?<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> I imagine it's Mr. Frohman<br> you're really afraid of, isn't it?<br> - Oh, I'm....<br> - Perhaps.<br> He doesn't want you to appear<br> too much socially.<br> Frankly, no, he doesn't.<br> And you don't like me<br> very well anyway, do you?<br> - Frankly, no, I don't.<br> - No. She doesn't!<br> You put him in his place, all right.<br> What would Gen. Grant think<br> if he knew we were using...<br> ...the very shadow of his tomb<br> as our meeting place?<br> Well, I never knew the general personally,<br> but I have an idea he'd approve.<br> I don't know. Nobody else seems to.<br> At least, Mr. Frohman doesn't.<br> And why not?<br> Why can't we meet where we like?<br> Go where we want?<br> Just because he has you<br> under contract...<br> ...is no reason he should<br> dictate your personal life.<br> - I'm here.<br> - Yes, and so am I.<br> But it must seem like<br> kindergarten to you.<br> Why?<br> The great Mr. Ziegfeld,<br> producer of the Follies...<br> ...surrounded by hundreds<br> of beautiful women...<br> ...sitting on a bench, holding hands...<br> ...watching the riverboats<br> go back and forth.<br> - Doesn't sound a bit like you, does it?<br> - No, it doesn't.<br> But here I am, sitting on a bench...<br> ...holding hands and watching<br> the riverboats go back and forth.<br> And regretting all the years<br> I haven't known you.<br> Didn't Anna Held take up a few<br> of those years?<br> Yes, Billie, she did.<br> She was truly a wonderful woman.<br> I love you for saying that.<br> Look, there's another ferryboat going<br> across to the Palisades.<br> Will you keep your eyes on it<br> while I tell you something?<br> Must I look at a ferryboat<br> to listen to you?<br> Yes, or I won't be able to tell you.<br> You mean the great lady's man<br> is bashful?<br> Strange as it may seem,<br> in your presence, he is.<br> All right, I'm looking.<br> I love you, Billie.<br> The ferryboat.<br> I haven't anything to offer you, because<br> there's nothing you really seem to need.<br> You've made the most of yourself<br> unassisted, and that's grand.<br> Ferryboat.<br> You're a great star already,<br> so there's little I can offer you.<br> Nothing I can give you,<br> except my love.<br> That isn't enough.<br> I'd expect part of your ambition,<br> half of your trouble...<br> ...two-thirds of your worries<br> and all of your respect.<br> Here's your medicine, madame.<br> No, thank you, Marie.<br> I'm tired of it.<br> - But, madame....<br> - No, no, no, no.<br> Perhaps you would like<br> to go to Paris?<br> No, I'm too tired to go anywhere<br> and to do anything.<br> Marie....<br> Look at the paper...<br> ...and tell me where did they go<br> on their honeymoon?<br> But they couldn't go anywhere,<br> madame.<br> Miss Burke is appearing in a play here.<br> We saw her only two weeks ago.<br> You insisted, madame.<br> You remember.<br> Oui, I know. And we enjoyed it<br> very much too.<br> She's a lovely actress, Marie, oui?<br> She has such twinkling eyes...<br> ...and such a funny little twitter<br> when she speaks.<br> Yes, I can well imagine<br> Flo being in love with her.<br> Marie?<br> Call his office.<br> I will congratulate him.<br> Hello? Brian 3093, please.<br> I should wish him luck, oui?<br> - Oui, I should.<br> - Mr. Ziegfeld, please.<br> - Miss Anna Held speaking.<br> - No, Marie, hang up!<br> - I cannot speak with him today!<br> - Mr. Ziegfeld?<br> He's on the telephone, madame.<br> He is?<br> Hello, Flo.<br> Yes, here's Anna.<br> I'm so happy for you today.<br> I could not help but call on you<br> and congratulate you.<br> Wonderful, Flo.<br> Never better in my whole life.<br> I'm so excited about my new plans.<br> I'm going to Paris.<br> Yes, for a few weeks,<br> and then I can get back...<br> ...and then I'm doing a new show,<br> and I--<br> Oui, it's all so wonderful.<br> I'm so happy.<br> Yes, and I hope you are happy too.<br> Yes?<br> I'm so glad for you, Flo.<br> It sounds funny for ex-husband and ex-wife<br> to tell each other how happy they are, oui?<br> Yes, Flo.<br> Goodbye, Flo.<br> Goodbye.<br> If you love him so much,<br> why did you divorce him?<br> Because I thought it would<br> bring him back to me.<br> I was sure that it would<br> bring him back to me.<br> Goody, goody, goody!<br> Is that all for me?<br> That certainly is, every bit for you.<br> And that isn't all. Sidney?<br> Yes, sir?<br> Now, if you don't like the view<br> from this side...<br> - ...then--<br> - I don't.<br> - That's the chimney Santa came down.<br> - Yes!<br> - That's where the reindeer stopped.<br> - I wonder how they kept from sliding off.<br> Probably the bricks stopped them.<br> See, Mommy, it's almost big enough<br> for me to get in.<br> - It is!<br> - It's almost big enough for us all to get in.<br> - Oh, yes! Sidney....<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Hasn't Santa Claus brought<br> the elephant yet?<br> Not yet, sir, but he, she-- It may<br> be here at any moment, sir.<br> - You didn't buy an elephant?<br> - I did.<br> - A live elephant, Daddy?<br> - A great big, live elephant.<br> I beg your pardon, sir, madam.<br> In behalf of the help,<br> and as their spokesman...<br> ...I wish to express our thanks<br> for your thoughtfulness and generosity...<br> ...and to wish you a very<br> merry Christmas.<br> - Thank you.<br> - That's very nice, Sidney.<br> And may we wish a very<br> merry Christmas to all of you.<br> Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> And to you, Miss Patricia.<br> Same to you, Sidney.<br> Now, how about opening<br> your presents?<br> With all this extravagance,<br> I'm a little afraid to.<br> Nonsense, darling,<br> that's what Christmas is for.<br> Come on, now.<br> - Oh, Flo.<br> - Now.<br> - This isn't all for me?<br> - Well, who else?<br> - I don't know which one to open first.<br> - Well, suppose you try this one.<br> Oh, Flo!<br> A crown of diamonds.<br> How beautiful.<br> This proves that America<br> is not a republic.<br> Because you are the queen,<br> and queens always wear crowns.<br> A bracelet for the regal wrist.<br> A pendant for the royal throat.<br> - And....<br> - Flo!<br> A cloak for Her Majesty's shoulders.<br> - Darling!<br> - And....<br> - Oh, no, Flo. Nothing else!<br> - Yes.<br> A kiss from her most humble subject.<br> Darling!<br> Oh, everything's so lovely.<br> - But you shouldn't have done so much.<br> - Oh, well, I....<br> I hadn't anything to do with it.<br> It was Santa Claus.<br> He brought everything.<br> Yes, I know, but Santa Claus<br> was far too extravagant.<br> You should take some of it back.<br> Oh, Mama, I don't want Santa Claus<br> to take back any of my presents.<br> Don't worry, he won't.<br> No, and he won't take back<br> any of your mama's either.<br> I'd cry if he took my circus back.<br> - You would?<br> - Why, darling?<br> - You like it better than your other presents?<br> - But I wish it was a real, live circus.<br> Well, I guess you'll have to do<br> a circus, Flo.<br> Could you, Daddy?<br> Well, I don't know. Let's see.<br> I've never had any experience<br> with circuses.<br> But I can try.<br> I'll tell you what. Let's make a chorus<br> in front of these two wagons.<br> Who's this fellow? That's the ringmaster<br> in the center, where a ringmaster should be.<br> Now, we'll put these two acrobats<br> up next to him...<br> ...then we'll put this Tyrollean fellow<br> there. Put the clown next to him.<br> He's a funny fellow,<br> and there's the lion-tamer.<br> Gosh, I bet he's a brave fellow too.<br> And there's the drum major.<br> And here is the strongman.<br> We'll call him Sandow.<br> - And who is this?<br> - Well, that's....<br> Oh! Of course.<br> That's little Harriet Hoctor.<br> I've always wanted<br> to give her a chance.<br> I'll tell you what. Now, you hold her for a<br> minute, and we'll bring her on later. Now...<br> ...let's put it all back of a curtain,<br> just as I do in the theater.<br> Now, this is the curtain.<br> - What's the laugh, Jack?<br> - This article on Ziegfeld.<br> Says he's broke and can't<br> borrow a nickel from any bank.<br> He wouldn't have to borrow<br> if he'd commercialized.<br> He'd never send out<br> a number two company.<br> He wanted the public to see<br> his best production.<br> Why doesn't he stick to his Follies?<br> That other show is terrible.<br> - Guess the old boy's washed-up.<br> - He's been slipping for years.<br> - White and Carroll have got it all over him.<br> - Bob....<br> Let me have a cold towel, will you?<br> Well, the guy's getting old.<br> Yeah, and broke. He won't<br> have another hit on Broadway.<br> - Isn't someone making a theater for him?<br> - Yeah. It's to be his monument.<br> It's about time.<br> He could use a monument.<br> - I don't know you fellows.<br> - You got nothing on me. I don't know you.<br> You ought to. You've been burying me<br> for five minutes. I'm Ziegfeld. You're right.<br> I'm not gonna have another hit<br> on Broadway. I'm gonna have four.<br> Four at one time.<br> You get that? Four!<br> And all hits.<br> Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld!<br> You forgot your tie.<br> He's gonna have four hits,<br> and he hasn't got a tie left.<br> Flo.<br> Darling.<br> Why did you come upstairs without<br> saying hello? Are you trying to elude me?<br> Well, I'm not feeling very well, dear.<br> Poor darling. You're just tired.<br> Where's your tie?<br> What do you think of that? I....<br> I must have left it<br> in the barbershop this afternoon.<br> And you've been around<br> without it ever since?<br> Darling, that isn't like you.<br> What's wrong, Flo?<br> Billie, I'm all through.<br> - Through with what?<br> - Everything. I'm slipping. I'm...<br> ...getting old.<br> And who told you that?<br> - Three men in the barbershop.<br> - That's why you forgot your tie.<br> Yes, I've never done anything<br> like that in my whole life.<br> Isn't that tragic? For the first time<br> in your long career, you forgot a tie.<br> It's a calamity.<br> - Who were those men, Flo?<br> - I don't know. I never saw them before.<br> They said I'd never produce another hit.<br> And what did you say?<br> I told them I'd have four on Broadway<br> at the same time.<br> - Sounds more like you.<br> - Yeah, but it was only a bluff.<br> I'm sorry, dear.<br> I don't mean to worry you.<br> Where's Patricia?<br> She's having her dinner.<br> - You came home very late, dear.<br> - Yes, dear. I'm sorry. I....<br> I've been so worried.<br> The play is such a terrible failure.<br> But you're not, darling.<br> Afraid I am.<br> - Well, shall we have some dinner?<br> - Flo.<br> I'm disappointed in you.<br> I didn't think you'd ever lose<br> confidence in yourself.<br> But I must be the failure, not you.<br> - Oh, Billie.<br> - No, I mean it, darling.<br> Before we were married...<br> ...you never thought of failure<br> even when you were broke.<br> It was your sublime superiority<br> more than anything else...<br> ...that made me admire you so much.<br> Please don't change, Flo.<br> Don't let Patricia and me<br> become a worry to you.<br> We don't expect you<br> to reduce your life to just us.<br> I want you to go right on<br> being just as you always were.<br> I would never be jealous...<br> ...because with your love of beauty,<br> you could never be cheap or common.<br> So in whatever you do...<br> ...you need never fear me.<br> And what is more important...<br> ...don't be afraid of yourself.<br> I'm not gonna be afraid, Billie.<br> All right, young man.<br> I'll give you a chance to prove it.<br> In my vault, I have all the jewelry<br> you've ever given me...<br> ...even the queen's crown...<br> ...and some very good bonds.<br> They're all yours...<br> ...on one condition.<br> That you keep your promise to those<br> three men and have four hits on Broadway.<br> - Is that a bargain?<br> - Oh, Billie.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Just a minute.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld, it's Police Inspector Doyle.<br> He says it's important.<br> - Why didn't you say so? Send him in.<br> - All right.<br> All right, Mr. Doyle.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Hello, inspector.<br> - We got them, all right.<br> - You did? That's wonderful.<br> It is wonderful,<br> with the descriptions you gave us.<br> - Where are they?<br> - Right outside.<br> - Bring them in.<br> - All right, sir.<br> Bring those birds in here.<br> - Here they are.<br> - What's going on?<br> - Pipe down, pipe down.<br> - What's the charge against these men?<br> - Murder.<br> - Murder?<br> Yes, murder.<br> About a year ago, these three gentlemen<br> killed me and buried me.<br> - Killed? Buried?<br> - Yes. In a Times Square barbershop.<br> - Remember?<br> - Oh, yes, I remember. Don't you?<br> Now, I'm going to give each of you<br> a box to all four of my shows.<br> Four hits, all in one season.<br> And then I want you to tell me whether<br> or not you still think I'm washed-up.<br> I'm sorry, but this is the only way<br> I could locate you.<br> I knew that if you were to be found at all,<br> Inspector Doyle was the one to do it.<br> Sam, have Goldie take their reservations<br> for whatever nights they wish.<br> - Good day, gentlemen.<br> - This way.<br> - Thank you.<br> - That's getting even with a vengeance.<br> That's not a bad ending<br> for a practical joke, is it?<br> Goldie, take these gentlemen's<br> names and addresses.<br> Don't you realize what you<br> may have let yourself in for?<br> - What?<br> - They can sue you for false arrest.<br> - And the police department.<br> - Don't you realize we have nothing...<br> - ...to worry about anymore?<br> - I hope so.<br> No need to hope.<br> You know what I've been doing?<br> - What?<br> - Buying stocks. I've bought over a million.<br> - Outright?<br> - No, on margin.<br> But all solid securities.<br> When I've paid for them, I'm gonna<br> buy another million and another.<br> - Sam, I'm going to be really rich.<br> - I hope you're right, sir.<br> But the market's been behaving<br> very queerly these last few days.<br> - Yes?<br> - Croydon & Company on the phone.<br> - Put them on.<br> - Been trying to get you.<br> They're my broker. Hello? Speaking.<br> Oh. Well, what happened?<br> Down 20 to 40 points?<br> How much?<br> - Three hundred thousand?!<br> - What is it?<br> Oh, no, no, no! Don't do that!<br> I'll cover. I'll get the money<br> to you in just a little while.<br> - Will you put Holloway on the phone?<br> - Flo, what is it?<br> The market, Sam, it's crashed.<br> I've got to get $300,000<br> in cash, immediately.<br> - How are we gonna do it?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Maybe I could borrow it from a bank.<br> - On what?<br> On your shows.<br> It's too late. I've already mortgaged the<br> shows for the first payments on the stock.<br> What's that?<br> But you've got to locate him!<br> Yes, I'll cover. I'll get the money to you<br> in a while. Just hold the wire.<br> - Sam, get Billings.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Try his house, his office,<br> anywhere, but get Billings!<br> Mr. Nagus, we haven't received your check,<br> and your margin's wiped out.<br> Hello, Mr. Billings. I'll be right with you.<br> No, we can't, Mr. Nagus.<br> I'm sorry, but we can't hold<br> your stocks any longer.<br> Mr. Billings, we've had<br> to sell you out too.<br> Well, that takes me back<br> to my second childhood consistently.<br> I was a poor kid when I started.<br> - Mr. Ziegfeld's on number six for you.<br> - Excuse me, Mr. Billings.<br> Hello? Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Yes, we had to sell you out<br> about half an hour ago.<br> Yes.<br> I know it is, and I'm terribly sorry.<br> - I didn't know Ziegfeld was in the market.<br> - Yes, very heavy.<br> - He'll lose everything.<br> - Everything?<br> Everything.<br> Well, this is one time<br> he can't get it from me.<br> Yes, madam. Yes, madam, it is.<br> The doctor left<br> about 10 minutes ago, madam.<br> He seemed very happy<br> about Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Said he might stay up for a while longer.<br> Oh, he did so enjoy sitting up to dinner<br> with you and Miss Patricia.<br> - No, madam.<br> - But don't let him stay up too long.<br> Yes, I know, but the more he rests,<br> the sooner he'll be well again.<br> And tell him I'll be home<br> immediately after the performance.<br> - It's time for your entrance, Miss Burke.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> Sidney, be sure to call me<br> right after the second act.<br> Yes, about 10:05.<br> Yes, madam.<br> Madam was very happy about you, sir.<br> Oh, my poor Billie.<br> I wish she weren't working.<br> But it does help some, Sidney.<br> - Get those wires off as quickly as you can.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Were you able to reach<br> Eddie Cantor by phone?<br> The Los Angeles operator's<br> been trying for some time, sir.<br> Tell her to keep on trying.<br> - Sidney?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> When you get him...<br> ...tell him that I want him<br> for a new show.<br> Tell him I'll start rehearsals the instant<br> he can get away from those pictures.<br> Tell him I need him.<br> - I haven't had a real show in two years.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Wasn't that the bell, Sidney?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Well, why don't you answer it.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Mr. Billings.<br> - Hello, Sidney.<br> How's Mr. Ziegfeld?<br> Well, he's much improved, sir,<br> but he's very nervous.<br> He will be glad to see you, sir.<br> If we could get him<br> started on a new show, sir.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I mean to say, if he had the money, sir.<br> Yes, well, we'll see that he gets it.<br> My valet isn't as efficient<br> as you used to be, Sidney.<br> He lets me neglect things.<br> All right for me to see him?<br> - Yes, sir. I wouldn't stay too long.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Well, hello, Ziggy.<br> How are you feeling?<br> Hello, Jack.<br> I'm feeling much better.<br> - Thank you. Sit down, won't you?<br> - Yes.<br> Let me look at you.<br> I don't think you've been sick. Just playing<br> possum so your creditors can't find you.<br> No.<br> No creditors.<br> No. No creditors.<br> - When are you gonna be up and around?<br> - Well...<br> - ...pretty soon now, I hope.<br> - Hurry up.<br> I'm expecting you<br> to go to Europe with me.<br> Oh. Well, when are you sailing?<br> In a couple of weeks.<br> We'll stop off at Monte Carlo.<br> You can break the bank again.<br> And then we'll go to London. Maybe<br> we can find some new talent together.<br> Does it interest you?<br> Yes. Yes, I'd like to go to London.<br> Yeah? Why?<br> - You got someone in mind?<br> - No.<br> - Why, have you?<br> - No.<br> But I wouldn't tell you if I had,<br> not if you were 10 times as sick as you are.<br> Oh, those were great old days, Jack.<br> Yeah.<br> Remember the fair?<br> Do I. Little Egypt.<br> - Sandow.<br> - Yeah, and then Anna Held.<br> Yes.<br> Oh, I'm sorry, Ziggy.<br> Why is it, Jack, that in a world so old...<br> ...life must be so short?<br> Short? I feel as if<br> I'd been here 1000 years.<br> And I'm gonna stay 1000 more.<br> And you'd feel the same way if you'd<br> snap out of it and get a new show started.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I'd like to do another Follies.<br> Why don't you do it.<br> Don't you think it's about time<br> that you and I split 50-50 in something?<br> I'd love to, Jack.<br> But it'll take a lot of money.<br> I've never refused you before, have I?<br> No, but...<br> ...that was all in the dark ages.<br> Before the Depression, I mean.<br> - I heard that the market got you.<br> - Me? Why, I.... Don't be silly.<br> I'm too smart for any stock market.<br> Oh, I lost a couple of thousand or so,<br> but I got out in time.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> How about you? Did it get you?<br> Oh, no. No, I....<br> I never played the market.<br> Oh, I may have dropped<br> a few hundred, maybe...<br> ...but nothing to speak of.<br> Well, how much money<br> do you suppose it'll take, Ziggy?<br> - A couple of hundred thousand.<br> - A couple of hundred thousand?<br> Well, okay, it's a deal.<br> Pull yourself together, get well,<br> and I'll give you money.<br> Isn't that wonderful, Mr. Ziegfeld?<br> Doesn't that make you feel better, sir?<br> Yes, that makes me feel much better.<br> Jack...<br> ...you're a real person.<br> Yeah, well, you're....<br> You're not a bad sort yourself, Ziggy.<br> Well, I'll drop in tomorrow.<br> Yes. Do that.<br> And, Ziggy, if you just put your mind to it,<br> I think you'll be up and around in a week.<br> Don't let me rush you, because<br> while you're here convalescing...<br> ...I'll be picking out the gals<br> for the new show.<br> - Well, he looks all right to me, Sidney.<br> - Undoubtedly he will be, sir.<br> Thanks to you.<br> I hope so.<br> Take good care of him, Sidney.<br> Because if anything happened<br> to Ziggy, I....<br> Well, take good care of him.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> I wouldn't tax my strength<br> if I were you, sir.<br> Sidney...<br> ...I've got things to do.<br> I must get Cantor, Bill Rogers,<br> Bill Fields.<br> They must come back to me!<br> I'll have all my old stars<br> together in one great show.<br> I must do the biggest Follies<br> of my whole life!<br> I....<br> Oh, Sidney, I'm so terribly broke.<br> But Mr. Billings, sir,<br> isn't he going to help you?<br> Sidney, he hasn't a nickel.<br> He was lying to me just<br> to make me feel better.<br> We're both broke.<br> I wouldn't worry about that, sir.<br> You've been broke before, sir.<br> Yes, I know.<br> I've always laughed about it.<br> But I can't laugh anymore, Sidney...<br> ...because I've been wrong.<br> I've got nothing.<br> Nothing to leave anyone.<br> Nothing, sir?<br> You leave them the memories...<br> ...of the finest things ever done<br> on the stage, sir.<br> You'll leave them a name that they<br> can be proud of all their lives.<br> You'll soon feel better...<br> ...and then you can do more beautiful<br> things than ever before, sir.<br> It's nice of you, Sidney, to say that.<br> I must call madam again now, sir.<br> It's after 10.<br> The memories...<br> ...of the finest things ever done<br> on the stage.<br> Chicory 5161.<br> Hello? Get me Miss Burke's<br> dressing room, please.<br> Yes.<br> Oh, Miss Burke.
