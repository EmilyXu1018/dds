He doesn't like<br> the dark and cries on occasion...<br> ...but other than that....<br> He cries, does he?<br> Got a lot to cry about, I'd say.<br> You know what he did.<br> I read the court transcript.<br> Thank you, missus.<br> My pleasure.<br> IKids!<br> Lunch is about ready.<br> Y'all come on up.<br> Coming, Mama!<br> What exactly are you<br> trying to find out?<br> I wonder if he did anything<br> like that before.<br> Why? Has he said anything?<br> No, but a man who does<br> a thing like that...<br> ...has often developed a taste for it<br> over time. It occurred to me...<br> ...that it might be easy enough to<br> follow his back trail. Find out.<br> A man his size, and colored to boot,<br> can't be that hard to trace.<br> You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.<br> Believe me, we tried.<br> Like he'd dropped out of the sky.<br> How can that be?<br> We're in a depression.<br> A third of the country's out of work.<br> People are drifting by the thousands,<br> looking for jobs, for greener grass.<br> Even a giant like Coffey<br> wouldn't get noticed everywhere.<br> Not until he kills<br> a couple of little girls.<br> He is...<br> ...strange, I admit.<br> But there doesn't seem to be<br> any real violence in him.<br> I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.<br> I deal with them day in and day out.<br> You didn't come to ask me<br> whether he killed before.<br> You came to see if I think<br> he did it at all.<br> Do you?<br> One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.<br> He was found with the victims<br> in his arms.<br> And yet you defended him.<br> Everyone is entitled to a defense.<br> IKids! Lunch!<br> Y'all listen to your mama!<br> I'll tell you something.<br> You listen close too, because it<br> might be something you need to know.<br> I'm listening.<br> We had us a dog.<br> Just a sweet mongrel.<br> You know the kind.<br> Well, in many ways,<br> a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.<br> You get to know it.<br> Often, you get to love it.<br> It is of no particular use...<br> ...but you keep it around<br> because you think it loves you.<br> If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you<br> never have to find out any different.<br> My wife and I were not so lucky.<br> Caleb, come here for a second.<br> Come here.<br> Please, son.<br> He still has the one good eye.<br> I suppose he's lucky...<br> ...not to be completely blind.<br> We get down on our knees and thank God<br> for that much at least.<br> Right, Caleb?<br> Go on in, now.<br> That dog attacked my boy<br> for no reason.<br> Just got it in his mind one day.<br> The same with John Coffey.<br> He was sorry afterwards.<br> Of that I have no doubt.<br> But those little girls...<br> ...stayed raped and murdered.<br> Maybe he'd never done it before.<br> My dog never bit before.<br> But I didn't concern myself with that.<br> I went out with my rifle, grabbed<br> his collar and blew his brains out.<br> Is Coffey guilty?<br> Yes, he is.<br> Don't you doubt it.<br> And don't you turn your back on him.<br> You may get away with it once<br> or even a hundred times...<br> ...but in the end...<br> ...you'll get bit.<br> Oh, me! Oh, my!<br> I'm smelling me some corn bread.<br> It's from my missus.<br> She wanted to thank you.<br> Thank me for what?<br> Well, you know.<br> For helping me.<br> Helping you with what?<br> You know.<br> Was your missus pleased?<br> Several times.<br> John, I can smell that from over here.<br> I surely can.<br> Can I give Del and Mr. Jingles some?<br> Well, it's yours, John.<br> You can do with it as you please.<br> Here.

I will.<br> He's pitching a fit.<br> He'll be fine, boys.<br> Trust me on this one.<br> Hey, fellers!<br> All I wanted me was a little<br> corn bread, you motherfuckers!<br> All I wanted me was<br> a little corn bread!<br> I learned my lesson.<br> I'll be good.<br> Hey, Toot.<br> Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.<br> Little Black Sambo!<br> Yes, sir, yes, sir.
