                        1<br> Greece and the islands<br> of the Aegean Sea...<br> ...have given birth to many myths<br> and legends of war and adventure.<br> And these once-proud stones,<br> these ruined and shattered temples...<br> ...bear witness to the civilization<br> that flourished and then died here.<br> And of the demigods and heroes<br> who inspired those legends...<br> ...on this sea and these islands.<br> But though the stage is the same,<br> ours is a legend of our own times...<br> ...and its heroes are not demigods,<br> but ordinary people.<br> In 1943, so the story goes...<br> ...2000 British soldiers lay<br> marooned on the island of Kheros...<br> ...exhausted and helpless.<br> They had exactly one week to live.<br> In Berlin, the Axis had determined...<br> ...on a show of strength<br> in the Aegean Sea...<br> ...to bully neutral Turkey into<br> coming into the war on their side.<br> The scene of that demonstration<br> was to be Kheros...<br> ...itself of no military value,<br> but only miles off the coast of Turkey.<br> The cream of the German war machine,<br> rested and ready...<br> ...was to spearhead the attack.<br> The men on Kheros were doomed...<br> ...unless they could be evacuated<br> before the blitz.<br> But the only passage<br> to and from Kheros...<br> ...was guarded and blocked<br> by two great...<br> ...newly designed,<br> radar-controlled guns...<br> ...on the nearby island of Navarone.<br> Guns too powerful and accurate...<br> ...for any Allied ship then<br> in the Aegean to challenge.<br> Allied Intelligence learned<br> of the projected blitz...<br> ...only one week before<br> the appointed date.<br> What took place in the next six days<br> became the legend of Navarone.<br> Yes?<br> I'm looking for<br> Commodore Jensen.<br> I'm Jensen.<br> Come in, Mallory.<br> You're late.<br> I'm sorry. Our plane was attacked<br> an hour out of Crete.<br> - We got into Alex on one engine, sir.<br> - The Germans have a price on you...<br> ...and Andrea Stavros<br> of 10,000 pounds apiece.<br> How did you know that?<br> I should do. I'm your boss.<br> You've been working for me<br> the past 18 months.<br> I'm delighted to make<br> your acquaintance.<br> Did they say<br> you were going on leave?<br> Yes, sir. They did.<br> Well, I'm sorry.<br> I'm afraid that's not true.<br> Not yet, at any rate.<br> Here's your old chum.<br> Come and say hello to him.<br> You haven't changed since Athens.<br> Hello, Roy.<br> Come along, gentlemen, will you?<br> Barnsby...<br> ...these gentlemen have<br> an interest in Navarone.<br> We've heard you on radio, but<br> perhaps you'll be more specific now.<br> I'll be specific.<br> As you can plainly see,<br> it was bloody awful!<br> Squadron Leader<br> Barnsby's Australian.<br> But we'd love to go back,<br> wouldn't we boys?<br> - Sure! Right!<br> - Just as soon as we can! But...<br> ...only on one condition.<br> We want the joker who thought<br> of this to come with us...<br> ...and when we get there...<br> ...we're gonna shove him<br> out at 10,000 feet...<br> ...without a parachute.<br> Bloody right.<br> - It was bad as that?<br> - Bad?!<br> It can't be done.<br> Not from the air, anyway.<br> You're sure about that,<br> squadron leader? This is important.<br> So's my life!<br> To me, anyway. And the lives<br> of these jokers here...<br> ...and the 18 men we lost tonight!<br> Look, sir...<br> ...first...<br> ...you've got that old fortress<br> on top of that bloody cliff.<br> Then you've got<br> the bloody cliff overhang.<br> You can't even see the bloody cave,<br> let alone the guns.<br> And anyway, we haven't got<br> a bloody bomb big enough...<br> ...to smash that bloody rock.<br> And that's the bloody truth, sir.<br> I know how to hit those guns.<br> Yes?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You fill a plane full of TNT...<br> ...and then you do a suicide<br> dive right into that cave.<br> There's just one problem, sir:<br> Getting someone to pilot the plane.<br> I see. Perhaps you might<br> consider it yourself.<br> Thank you, squadron leader,<br> and all of you.<br> I know you've done your best,<br> and nobody could have done more.<br> And I'm sorry.<br> As you've probably surmised, I'm the<br> joker they'd heave out at 10,000 feet.<br> And I can't say I blame them.<br> I knew it was hopeless from the start,<br> but it had to be tried.<br> Anyway, this is why you<br> were hauled out of Crete.<br> And don't mislay this, will you?<br> No, sir.<br> We're pressed for time.<br> Let's go, gentlemen, shall we?<br> - Any questions?<br> - Only one.<br> Why me?<br> What you want is<br> a seagoing taxi driver.<br> Other men know these waters<br> as well as I do.<br> Yes, but you've got<br> special qualifications.<br> Franklin'll explain it.<br> It's his idea, anyway.<br> First, you speak Greek and German.<br> Second, you've kept alive in occupied<br> territory for a year and a half.<br> And before the war, you were the<br> greatest mountain climber in the world.<br> "Keith Mallory, the human fly."<br> Come to the point, Roy.<br> The point is that our Resistance<br> contacts on Navarone...<br> ...say there's only one spot on<br> the coast the Germans don't watch:<br> The South Cliff.<br> It's 400 feet straight up...<br> ...and it can't be climbed<br> by man or beast.<br> And that's where you come in.<br> That was your idea too?<br> That's right.<br> I want you to get me and my team<br> over there and on top of that cliff.<br> When you've done that, you can<br> take a richly deserved leave...<br> ...and a long-overdue promotion.<br> I see.<br> Can you do it?<br> No.<br> With all due respect,<br> I think the operation is insane.<br> But that's not my business.<br> My business is to climb<br> and I haven't climbed in five years.<br> That's a long time.<br> It's too long for this cliff.<br> And you're asking me<br> to do it at night.<br> I wouldn't try it in broad daylight.<br> I'll have a go myself, then.<br> I've climbed a bit.<br> Don't be a fool. You'd get yourself<br> killed and your team along with you.<br> - Then it's scrubbed?<br> - No, it's not scrubbed!<br> It can't be.<br> Not now.<br> Mallory...<br> ...this is our last hope.<br> The Germans won't expect<br> a team of saboteurs at this late date.<br> Those 2000 men on Kheros will<br> die next Wednesday morning...<br> ...unless somebody climbs the cliff.<br> There's nobody else<br> we can get in time.<br> If there were,<br> you wouldn't be here now.<br> I suppose it's too late to get<br> Andrea Stavros to help me.<br> On the contrary.<br> I think you'll find him waiting<br> for you in your hotel.<br> You think of everything.<br> I have to. It's part of my job.<br> - Thanks, Keith.<br> - It's my pleasure.<br> Nothing I like better<br> than a well-organized setup.<br> You'll want to know about the team.<br> Sydney, would you get us<br> some more coffee, please?<br> Franklin considers it the best team<br> in the business. I agree.<br> He himself is ideal for the job. He's<br> experienced and extremely capable.<br> Don't blush, Roy.<br> And best of all, he's lucky.<br> Aren't you lucky?<br> - If you say so, sir.<br> - I do, indeed.<br> Napoleon said once, when somebody<br> was up for promotion to general:<br> "Yes, I know he's brilliant.<br> But is he lucky?"<br> The emperor knew the value of luck.<br> Our Roy seems to have it.<br> - Then make me a general, sir.<br> - Patience, my dear boy, patience.<br> Now this is our Corporal Miller.<br> A chemistry professor in private life.<br> An absolute genius<br> with high explosives.<br> He blew up Rommel's headquarters...<br> ...with no damage<br> to the orphanage next door.<br> They don't come any better. We tried<br> to make him an officer. He refused.<br> This is "Butcher" Brown,<br> our mechanical marvel.<br> He's a genius with engines,<br> machinery, radios, et cetera.<br> And the best man with a knife<br> I've ever met.<br> He got his training in Spain. The boys<br> call him the Butcher of Barcelona.<br> Private Spyro Pappadimos.<br> What's his particular genius?<br> He's a born killer. A useful man<br> to have along on a job like this.<br> His father happens to be our chief<br> resistance contact on Navarone.<br> The boy went to America<br> to get an education.<br> I'm afraid he got the wrong kind.<br> Well, there's the team.<br> Pirates and cutthroats,<br> every one of them.<br> And of course, there's Lucky here.<br> And the redoubtable Mr. Stavros<br> and yourself.<br> With every one of us a genius,<br> how can we fail?<br> You can't.<br> We're sending six destroyers through<br> the Navarone Channel next Tuesday...<br> ...to take the men off Kheros.<br> If those guns aren't spiked by then...<br> ...there'll be six more ships<br> at the bottom of the Aegean.<br> There's your car, gentlemen.<br> Surprised?<br> I didn't think I'd see you again<br> so soon.<br> You thought you'd have<br> to look for me?<br> When the time came,<br> I would find you.<br> What is this?<br> We have to ferry some operators<br> to an island called Navarone.<br> - Do you know it?<br> - I know it.<br> I also know I have<br> work to do on Crete.<br> - Who's responsible for this?<br> - A major I used to know.<br> Name of Franklin.<br> He's a man who still has to prove<br> to himself he's a hero.<br> I'll speak to Franklin.<br> Where do I find him?<br> That's the man.<br> You can speak with him on the way.<br> Think they've got a chance?<br> Frankly, no.<br> Not a chance in the world.<br> I'll be surprised if they<br> get halfway to Navarone.<br> It's just a waste of six good men.<br> However, it doesn't matter, considering<br> how many have been wasted already.<br> I'm glad it's not my decision.<br> I'm only the middleman.<br> Still, they may get there<br> and they may pull it off.<br> Anything can happen in a war.<br> In the middle of absolute insanity...<br> ...people pull out<br> extraordinary resources.<br> Ingenuity, courage, self-sacrifice.<br> Pity we can't beat the problems<br> of peace in the same way.<br> It would be so much cheaper.<br> I never thought of it<br> in just that way.<br> - You're a philosopher.<br> - No.<br> I'm just the man who has to send<br> people out on jobs like this one.<br> Must have been delayed.<br> I'm sure he'll be here soon.<br> - Major Franklin?<br> - Right.<br> My name's Baker. Sorry I was delayed.<br> Come with me, please.<br> It's been so comfortable,<br> I hate to leave.<br> When you're all quite ready...<br> Charming.<br> Just like an English country hotel.<br> Where does everybody else sleep?<br> Nobody sleeps. On your feet,<br> professor. We've got homework to do.<br> If you insist, major.<br> What are you doing, friend?<br> Looking for dust?<br> No, friend. Microphones.<br> This is the British Army Post.<br> Don't you trust anyone?<br> No. That is why I have lived so long.<br> Mr. Stavros is Colonel Stavros<br> of the Greek 19th Motorized Regiment.<br> - He outranks us all.<br> - It is of no moment.<br> The 19th Regiment no longer exists,<br> for the time being.<br> - I beg your pardon, colonel.<br> - Andrea.<br> Please continue.<br> Right. If you're ready, corporal.<br> Yes, sir. Ready, sir.<br> Ready, willing and able, sir.<br> Champing at the bit.<br> Captain Mallory and Andrea...<br> ...are responsible for getting us<br> to where we're going.<br> I'll tell you where it is,<br> and why we're going.<br> That is, if you really want<br> to know, professor.<br> I'm all ears, sir. All ears.<br> We must avoid the coast road.<br> That means a 12-mile trek...<br> ...to St. Alexis, where Resistance<br> people from the town of Mandrakos...<br> ...will come and meet us<br> if they can make it.<br> Any questions?<br> I have an alternative route<br> to that place.<br> May I borrow your pencil, please?<br> Does the major think<br> this is possible?<br> I see.<br> That's a thought, isn't it?<br> Well, let's re-examine the plan<br> and see if we have any alternative.<br> Watch out!<br> - How long has he been there?<br> - I heard something 10 minutes ago.<br> I thought my ears were playing tricks.<br> Then I heard it again.<br> Ten minutes?<br> Brown, go and get Major Baker.<br> Yes, sir.<br> What's your name?<br> What are you doing here?<br> The major asked you a question!<br> Answer the major.<br> Sounds like Kurdish.<br> I don't understand it.<br> I'll try Greek.<br> - Translation, please.<br> - He doesn't speak English.<br> Why was he listening?<br> - What are you doing to that man?<br> - You know him?<br> That's Nicolai, our laundry boy.<br> Is he the reason I've been disturbed?<br> I've had a hard day!<br> Does his job involve<br> listening at keyholes?<br> - I don't believe it.<br> - We caught him at it.<br> It was just idle curiosity.<br> He doesn't speak English.<br> Why does he listen?<br> And why did he try to stab this man?<br> I presume he was trying<br> to defend himself.<br> In this part of the world, carrying a<br> knife doesn't make you a criminal.<br> Let him go.<br> Major Baker, arrest this man and<br> hold him incommunicado for a week.<br> After that, my advice is you<br> kick him out of Castelrosso.<br> Who the hell are you to give<br> me advice, major?<br> Then I'm asking you as a favor.<br> I'll consider it.<br> All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.<br> I said, let him go!<br> Pappadimos,<br> have you got your silencer?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Then use it. Shoot the laundry boy!<br> Are you crazy?<br> And if the major gets<br> in your way, shoot him too.<br> That's an order.<br> Captain, he's insane!<br> Surely you won't let him do this.<br> I can't stop him, he's in charge.<br> Anyway, I agree with him.<br> Of course, he doesn't have<br> to shoot you.<br> He can just call our HQ and you'll<br> be on a troopship home, as a private...<br> ...unless you give him your word that<br> you'll do exactly as he says.<br> All right.<br> If it means that much to you,<br> you have my word.<br> Take him, sergeant!<br> Stupid theatricals.<br> You're entitled to your opinion...<br> ...but I just saved your life.<br> I'm desperately sorry, gentlemen.<br> Really, I am.<br> It's embarrassing.<br> Just look at it!<br> No, it's exactly what we want.<br> They said you wanted a boat no one<br> would notice, but that's a disgrace!<br> Give me 36 hours,<br> and I know I can lay my hands...<br> ...on a German E-boat<br> in absolutely perfect condition.<br> I promise you,<br> only one careful owner.<br> I can pop over to Rhodes<br> and get it for you.<br> Won't the Germans have<br> something to say about that?<br> I suppose so, if they knew.<br> But I've got good connections there.<br> What do you say?<br> - No, thanks. We can't wait.<br> - Pity.<br> I'll get my chaps<br> to help with your gear.<br> No, that's all right, thank you.<br> Right. I get it.<br> Special cargo and all that, what?<br> Well, good luck to you.<br> Brown?<br> Yes, sir?<br> What do you think?<br> Well, she's a bit of a monster, sir.<br> But I think I've got her worried.<br> - Comfortable, professor?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> Matter of fact,<br> the boys have almost finished.<br> Permission to speak?<br> - What about?<br> - Well, the condition of this vessel.<br> Talk to Captain Mallory.<br> He's in charge of transportation.<br> Very good, sir.<br> I've inspected this boat<br> and I think you ought to know...<br> ...I can't swim.<br> I'll keep it in mind.<br> Dead on 10, sir.<br> Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.<br> Report my signal. Report my signal.<br> Hello, George-Mike-William.<br> George-Mike-William.<br> Strength three. Strength three, over.<br> Hello, Lucky.<br> High Flight reports Indians on warpath<br> in your territory.<br> So please be careful.<br> Also, severe storms expected<br> throughout your area tonight.<br> Repeat. High Flight reports<br> Indians on warpath...<br> Hey.<br> Ship ahoy!<br> Go on working.<br> They'll have glasses.<br> Lower your sails!<br> We are coming aboard!<br> It's knee-deep in the hold,<br> but I think we'll manage.<br> You want a breather?<br> Wouldn't mind.<br> Funny the way that German officer<br> spoke English to us back there...<br> ...almost as if he knew who we were.<br> I had the same thought.<br> I think our friend Baker<br> may have some explaining to do.<br> I shouldn't have done it.<br> What's that?<br> Dragged you into this.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Forget it. I was getting tired<br> of Crete food anyway.<br> No, I'm stupid sometimes.<br> Even as a kid, I'd expect<br> people to play the games I liked.<br> Then I'd get furious when they didn't.<br> Well, now they have to,<br> so why worry?<br> Hot coffee!<br> That's good.<br> I'm sorry, captain.<br> There's a serious shortage of cups<br> aboard this ship.<br> I pointed out deficiencies<br> in this vessel.<br> I remember.<br> - Thanks.<br> - My pleasure.<br> Any time you want another chat,<br> about this boat, I mean, I'm available.<br> All right.<br> And I still can't swim.<br> Don't mind him.<br> He doesn't mean anything.<br> I don't mind him as much<br> as he seems to mind me.<br> Have you been together long?<br> Since the beginning out here.<br> He's the best friend I have<br> in this part of the world.<br> That's a pretty good partner<br> you've got there yourself.<br> Yes.<br> - We've been together a long time too.<br> - You're lucky.<br> He's going to kill me<br> when the war's over.<br> - You're not serious.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> So's he.<br> About a year ago, I gave<br> a German patrol a safe conduct...<br> ...to get their wounded into hospital.<br> I still had some romantic notions<br> about fighting a civilized war.<br> Anyway, they wanted Andrea<br> pretty badly even then.<br> They shot their casualties,<br> went to his house and blew it up.<br> He was out on a job, but his wife<br> and three children were in the house.<br> They were all killed.<br> I helped him to bury them.<br> He didn't say a word to me.<br> Never looked at me.<br> But after it was over, he said that<br> as far as he was concerned...<br> ...it wasn't the Germans who were<br> responsible, but me.<br> Me and my stupid<br> Anglo-Saxon decency.<br> He said what he<br> was going to do, and when.<br> Do you think he still means to do it?<br> He's from Crete.<br> Those people don't make idle threats.<br> I thought I was getting leave.<br> I was going to ask for<br> transfer to another area.<br> Take some time to think,<br> get ready for him.<br> And I messed that up.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's all right.<br> It's gonna be a long war.<br> What makes you sure<br> he's gonna wait that long?<br> I'm not. Not if he gets<br> the right opportunity.<br> What I'm banking on is, that now<br> all he wants to do is to kill Germans.<br> As long as I can be useful to him<br> in that department...<br> ...he'll do his best to keep me alive.<br> I hope.<br> That's nice of him.<br> Well, I can see his point.<br> The only way to win a war is to be<br> just as nasty as the enemy.<br> I'm only worried we'll find out<br> we're even nastier than they are.<br> I can't say that worries me.<br> Well, you're lucky.<br> Think I better<br> have a look at the hold.<br> Before Miller tells me to!<br> Help!<br> We've saved the explosives...<br> ...the guns...<br> ...and most of the ammunition.<br> I'm afraid we've lost the food<br> and the medical supplies.<br> But if we rendezvous with<br> the Resistance...<br> ...at St. Alexis,<br> they'll supply us with both.<br> Let's get out of this place<br> as quickly as we can.<br> Pappadimos and Miller, you'll have<br> the first shift with the stretcher.<br> You're officially<br> taking command, sir?<br> Yes, I suppose I am. Why?<br> Just for the record.<br> This afternoon on the boat...<br> ...you fumbled your job.<br> How'd that happen?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> The man was a foot away from you.<br> You only wounded him.<br> How could you miss?<br> I must have hesitated, sir.<br> You hesitated?<br> A man of your experience?<br> The Butcher of Barcelona?<br> How could you hesitate?<br> Well, I was tired.<br> I'm tired and I'm fed up.<br> I've been fighting this war<br> a long time.<br> I've been killing Germans since 1937.<br> There's no end to them.<br> Shoot a man at 200 yards,<br> he's just a target.<br> You kill him with a knife...<br> ...you're close enough to smell him.<br> I smell them in my sleep.<br> After the last time, I made a pact<br> with myself: I'd do my job.<br> But I wouldn't do the other anymore.<br> Not if I could help it.<br> And who gave you the right<br> to make a private peace?<br> You think you're<br> the only one who's tired?<br> I do my job, sir!<br> Your job is to kill enemy soldiers.<br> There will, of course,<br> be a code word.<br> If we don't answer, a patrol<br> will be here in no time.<br> Let's pack and get out.<br> Let's go.<br> Well?<br> The major's leg is broken<br> in two places.<br> He could be hurt inside too.<br> He needs medical attention.<br> What do you suggest?<br> - Leave him for the Germans.<br> - They'd get him to a hospital.<br> If he doesn't get sulphanilamide,<br> he doesn't stand a chance.<br> Naturally, you all think a lot<br> of Major Franklin. So do I.<br> We have two choices.<br> We can take him,<br> and if he doesn't get help, he'll die.<br> Or we can leave him here,<br> and he'll tell the Germans everything.<br> Roy? Never!<br> He might not be able to help himself.<br> They have other drugs<br> besides sulpha.<br> All they have to do is use scopolamine,<br> and he'll tell them our whole plan.<br> There is, of course, a third choice.<br> One bullet now. Better for him.<br> Better for us.<br> You take that man along,<br> you endanger us all.<br> Why not drop him off the cliff<br> and save a bullet?<br> And why don't you shut up?<br> Yes, there's a third choice.<br> We'll make it if necessary...<br> ...when it's necessary...<br> ...and not before!<br> Now let's move!<br> Brown, from now on your job is<br> to look after Major Franklin.<br> I said, move!<br> Morning!<br> I'm sorry.<br> Don't be silly. It's just bad luck.<br> Well, what do we do now?<br> Where are we?<br> We're on our way.<br> - I'm going to hold you up.<br> - No, you won't.<br> Anyway, the professor won the toss<br> and he's dying to carry you.<br> That's right. You're not<br> nearly as heavy as I thought.<br> Now look...<br> ...you've got to leave me.<br> You're out of your mind.<br> It's radio time.<br> Well, it's all on your plate now.<br> You'll never be able<br> to thank me enough.<br> I wanted the job all the time.<br> Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.<br> Report my signal.<br> Hello, George-Mike-William.<br> George-Mike-William.<br> Strength four. Strength four, over.<br> Hello, Lucky. This is most urgent.<br> Paddington Station will close<br> at midnight, X minus one.<br> Do you understand?<br> X minus one, over.<br> We've lost a full day.<br> Germans are gonna hit Kheros<br> a day ahead of time.<br> Gives us until midnight,<br> the day after tomorrow.<br> Message understood.<br> Message understood. Over and out.<br> I'd like to be alone with the major.<br> Roy, that was foolish.<br> You almost ruined everything.<br> We've just heard, we're canceled out.<br> Scrubbed.<br> What?<br> They're going for an amphibious<br> landing the day after tomorrow...<br> ...on the east coast.<br> The Turkish side.<br> The Turkish side?<br> And they're coming in force.<br> As far as we're concerned,<br> the pressure's off.<br> All we have to do is<br> make as much trouble as we can.<br> By tonight, we'll have you<br> in the hands of the underground.<br> We'll have you taken care of.<br> Try this again, I'll have Andrea<br> break your other leg.<br> Good luck.<br> Do not worry.<br> I shall see you tonight at St. Alexis.<br> Good evening, gentlemen.<br> Obviously, this place<br> has been used before.<br> Any food around?<br> I regret to say no.<br> Weren't you careless?<br> We might have been anyone.<br> I heard you coming five minutes ago.<br> No.<br> No!<br> Pappadimos,<br> it's time to relieve Andrea.<br> I'll take it.<br> No.<br> Pappadimos...<br> ...you go.<br> - Maybe he brought food.<br> - Hold it.<br> He might be faking.<br> Saved!<br> Don't move!<br> Raise your hands!<br> Raise your hands high!<br> All of you!<br> You there, with the food, speak!<br> You are not Germans.<br> Which of you is Major Franklin?<br> The man on the stretcher.<br> Who are you?<br> My name is Maria Pappadimos.<br> You may put your hands<br> down now, gentlemen.<br> Pappadimos?<br> They said Pappadimos was a man.<br> My father.<br> He was taken two days ago.<br> He was taken?<br> He told them nothing.<br> He will die first.<br> - You have sisters or brothers?<br> - A brother, Spyro, in America.<br> Oh, he's not as far away as all that.<br> He's that handsome devil<br> right over there.<br> Spyro!<br> Why did you do that for?<br> To remind you to write letters<br> occasionally.<br> - There's a war on!<br> - I mean before the war!<br> I promised myself I would do this<br> the first time I saw you again.<br> Well, I'm sorry, brother.<br> Which of you did this?<br> Well...<br> I'm afraid it was me.<br> - Who is she?<br> - My friend, Anna. She's one of us.<br> It's bad that this happened to her.<br> Before the Germans came, she was<br> a schoolteacher in Mandrakos.<br> Last year, she was caught. They<br> tortured her to make her betray us.<br> They whipped her until<br> the white of her bones showed.<br> Some nights, we could<br> hear her screaming.<br> Then they kept her in<br> the fortress for six months.<br> When they let her go...<br> ...she could not speak.<br> She has never spoken since.<br> Not even in her dreams.<br> Even I have never been allowed<br> to see the scars on her back.<br> But she's a good fighter.<br> As good as any of you!<br> Like a ghost, she goes anywhere!<br> She got us these guns.<br> And she kills without mercy.<br> You are very lucky, brother.<br> No, they are the friends! Our friends!<br> It's gangrene, sir.<br> If the leg doesn't come off, he'll die.<br> Does he know?<br> I don't think so.<br> Sir...<br> ...I beg your pardon, but I haven't<br> had a chance to talk to you alone.<br> I don't want to be left out anymore.<br> I want to be part of the team again.<br> Please give me a chance.<br> You can trust me.<br> I'll think it over.<br> That's gangrene! What choice<br> do we have now, captain?<br> - Who relieved you?<br> - She did.<br> - In future, take orders only from me.<br> - I asked you a question, sir!<br> And I heard you, corporal.<br> Get yourself something to eat.<br> That's an order.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> There's a lot of activity down there.<br> I can hear it.<br> They're turning Mandrakos<br> inside out.<br> As soon as they move out,<br> we'll move in.<br> We're gonna get you to a doctor.<br> Brown says that you are doing well.<br> Brown is a liar. And so are you.<br> I haven't lost my sense of smell,<br> you know.<br> I just hope the doctor's<br> a good surgeon.<br> I wonder what old Jensen would say?<br> My luck seems to have changed,<br> doesn't it?<br> I don't suppose I'll ever<br> be a general now.<br> This Franklin...<br> ...he's not a bad fellow.<br> No, not bad at all.<br> - You're sure there's a tunnel there?<br> - They'll never find us.<br> Well, they found us here.<br> Let's go. Let's go!<br> Oh, excuse me.<br> - Where is this tunnel?<br> - Up here, sir.<br> Where does this lead to?<br> We'll come out<br> just behind Mandrakos.<br> All right.<br> Let's keep going.<br> Anna?<br> You're limping. Are you hurt?<br> Do you need help?<br> Thank you, old bean.<br> Get off your behinds.<br> Think there's a fire escape?<br> These are fine people.<br> Give up quietly, gentlemen.<br> Unless you want many innocent<br> people killed, as well as yourselves.<br> Turn around, please.<br> Captain Mallory, you've made<br> a remarkable effort.<br> Unfortunately, it was<br> doomed from the beginning.<br> Will you tell me where you've<br> hidden your explosives?<br> No.<br> As your commanding officer, Captain<br> Mallory must play a heroic role.<br> You needn't carry such a burden.<br> You've all suffered a great deal.<br> Why prolong that suffering?<br> For you, the war is over.<br> Another officer is coming<br> to question you. A captain in the SS.<br> His methods, quite frankly,<br> are most severe.<br> None of you are in uniform.<br> Therefore, you're considered spies.<br> You know the penalty for espionage.<br> But if any one of you has the courage<br> to tell me where the explosives are...<br> ...I promise, you will not only<br> save your own life...<br> ...but the lives of your comrades.<br> This will be your only chance.<br> I do advise you to take it.<br> Please, sir! I am no spy!<br> I am not one of them!<br> You yellow...<br> Go on.<br> Sir, I swear to you, sir...<br> ...I'm just a poor fisherman.<br> Two days ago these men killed<br> my sailors and stole my boat.<br> They forced me to join them.<br> Sir, I am their prisoner!<br> Where did you learn<br> your English, fisherman?<br> In Cyprus, sir.<br> I swear to you, it's true.<br> Aren't you Andrea Stavros?<br> Colonel Stavros?<br> Oh, no. No, sir.<br> My name is Nondus Salonikus.<br> I told you,<br> I'm a fisherman from Cyprus.<br> Then how do you happen to wear<br> a shoulder holster?<br> They forced me to wear it...<br> ...and made it a kind ofjoke.<br> Where are the explosives?<br> I swear, sir...<br> ...I would tell you if I knew.<br> But, see, they didn't say.<br> The truth is, sir, they don't trust me.<br> I don't blame them.<br> The commandant will telephone<br> to congratulate you, Muesel.<br> Thank you.<br> I've questioned them about the<br> explosives, but they refuse to answer.<br> The Greek claims<br> he is not one of them.<br> Now you! You are not<br> of this company, you say?<br> No, sir, I'm not.<br> You are a liar!<br> - But Your Excellency...<br> - A liar!<br> Come, come. That didn't hurt.<br> - Where are the explosives?<br> - I don't know, Your Excellency.<br> Your Excellency,<br> I swear I do not know!<br> I am not one of these men!<br> They forced me to join them.<br> As I explained to the captain...<br> ...I'm just a...<br> ...poor fisherman from Cyprus.<br> My name is...<br> ...Nondus Salonikus.<br> I swear to you.<br> These men stole my boat and then<br> they forced me to join them.<br> Your Excellency...<br> Your Excellency, I am their prisoner!<br> Where are the explosives?<br> I want an answer now, or I'll personally<br> rearrange this officer's splints.<br> Very well.<br> I can't!<br> Please, I can't!<br> I can't!<br> - Get up!<br> - I'm sick! I'm sick!<br> - Get up!<br> - Please! Oh, I'm sick!<br> But I'm sick! No, please!<br> Please, I'm sick!<br> I'm sick! I'm sick!<br> Call the sentry in.<br> Now, Oberleutnant...<br> ...get on the phone.<br> Tell them you're not to be disturbed<br> until you give further orders.<br> Remember...<br> ...I speak German...<br> ...perfect.<br> Not very hygienic, I must say.<br> Shocking taste in undies too.<br> Ah, well...<br> Heil, everybody!<br> Roy...<br> ...we're gonna leave you here.<br> I understand.<br> We're gonna let them<br> chase us around for a while.<br> But the one thing<br> they mustn't know...<br> ...is about the landing<br> tomorrow night.<br> Of course.<br> Don't worry.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> Good luck.<br> Hold it.<br> We'll leave Major Franklin behind.<br> He's a wounded officer.<br> I expect him to get medical attention.<br> We don't make war on wounded men.<br> We're not all like Hauptmann Sessler.<br> Now, where's the camp radio station?<br> I will not tell you.<br> You wouldn't hesitate to kill me<br> for any number of reasons.<br> But not this one.<br> In any event, I will not tell you.<br> - So long, Roy.<br> - Good luck, Keith.<br> Well, Lucky, I shall miss you.<br> Try to be a bad patient, will you?<br> Keep on asking for bedpans.<br> Drives them mad.<br> I'll keep it in mind.<br> When this is over,<br> you'll buy me a lunch.<br> Roast beef, Yorkshire pudding,<br> a nice little red wine...<br> Steak and kidney pie.<br> Anything you say.<br> You'll be paying for it.<br> And you, colonel,<br> what a performance.<br> All right.<br> I hope you were right to leave<br> Franklin with the Germans.<br> Sir?<br> - Yes?<br> - No, not you, sir. Mr. Stavros.<br> Tell me about yourself.<br> - What do you want to know?<br> - Are you married?<br> I have been married.<br> My wife and children were killed.<br> Have you killed many people?<br> Only Germans.<br> Oh, some Italians too.<br> - Captain Mallory?<br> - Yes?<br> You are a lucky man.<br> Yes, I know.<br> - Mr. Stavros?<br> - Yes?<br> I like you.<br> I like you too.<br> I don't know.<br> Well, baby face,<br> I never would have known you.<br> You better get rid of that<br> fuzz under your nose.<br> No, I'm an officer, remember?<br> You just picked the wrong uniform.<br> Lights out in five minutes.<br> I want you as well-rested as possible.<br> Now, first thing in the morning...<br> ...we'll ditch the truck<br> and get hold of another car.<br> Then we'll pick up the explosives<br> and go into Navarone.<br> We've got to be inside the fortress<br> by 10:00 tomorrow night.<br> Might one inquire how?<br> We're gonna walk in.<br> Simply because of this masquerade?<br> No.<br> Because I told Franklin<br> our orders had been changed.<br> That we weren't after the guns.<br> That we were just to create<br> a diversion for an assault...<br> ...tomorrow night<br> on the Turkish side.<br> Now, if my hunch is right, the Germans<br> will give him scopolamine...<br> ...and that's what he'll tell them.<br> They may not believe it, but they'll<br> be faced with the fact that he does.<br> Now I'm gambling that<br> they'll clear out of Navarone...<br> ...and take up positions on the coast.<br> Very clever.<br> But that still leaves the garrison<br> inside the fortress...<br> ...and we get them out by having<br> Andrea, Pappadimos and Brown...<br> ...start up diversions<br> all over Navarone.<br> If there's enough confusion going...<br> ...Miller and I should have<br> a chance to break in.<br> At the same time, the girls will steal<br> the fastest boat they can find...<br> ...so we all have a chance of<br> getting out when this thing is over.<br> Very clever, indeed.<br> Suppose they don't have any<br> scopolamine? What happens then?<br> Suppose they use the<br> old-fashioned methods?<br> Suppose your ventriloquist's dummy<br> just won't talk...<br> ...because he's a good man?<br> He won't be easy to break!<br> He may take a lot of punishment<br> before he tells them our plan!<br> He may even die on them<br> and tell them nothing at all!<br> Have you considered that?<br> Yes, I have.<br> I'll bet you have!<br> I'll bet you've considered that<br> as far back as the cliff!<br> You and your...<br> ...three choices.<br> I'll bet that's why you dragged him<br> around with us all this time!<br> If he lives,<br> he'll never be the same again!<br> Do you know what you've done?<br> You've used up<br> an important human being!<br> Oh, I misjudged you.<br> You're rather a ruthless character,<br> Captain Mallory.<br> I didn't think of it back on the cliff.<br> But if I had...<br> ...I'd have done the same thing.<br> It's our only chance!<br> Well, right now I say<br> to hell with the job!<br> I've been on 100 jobs,<br> none of which altered the war.<br> There've been 1000 wars and there'll<br> be 1000 more, until we're all dead.<br> I don't care about the war anymore.<br> I care about Roy!<br> And if Turkey enters<br> on the wrong side?<br> So what? Let the world blow itself<br> to pieces, as it deserves!<br> What about the 2000 men on Kheros?<br> I don't know them.<br> But I do know the man on Navarone!<br> Mr. Miller, the man was<br> finished when he fell.<br> That's easy for you to say,<br> sitting there, drinking coffee!<br> It's funny. I was grateful<br> when you left him behind today.<br> I just hope before this job's over...<br> ...that I get the chance to use you<br> the way you've used him.<br> I'm sorry, but I couldn't think<br> of any other way.<br> Everybody get a good night's sleep.<br> No matter how it goes tomorrow...<br> ...you're gonna need it.<br> I'll take the first watch.<br> Hello.<br> Tell me, schoolteacher...<br> ...from a purely moral point of view...<br> ...bearing in mind that we represent<br> goodness and civilization...<br> ...do you think that what I did<br> was a civilized thing to do?<br> Scopolamine.<br> They are burning Mandrakos...<br> ...in punishment.<br> This part of town<br> has been evacuated...<br> ...because the guns' vibrations<br> has weakened the houses.<br> Where will the attacks come?<br> On the Turkish side.<br> What time?<br> Is the timetable clear?<br> Any questions?<br> Good luck.<br> I won't be needing this. You take it.<br> Spyro.<br> Andrea.<br> Everybody stay where you are.<br> The party's over.<br> Somebody's stepped on the cake.<br> Exhibit A: A clockwork fuse.<br> Elementary and archaic,<br> but they work.<br> This one won't work anymore.<br> Know why?<br> The clock's okay,<br> but the contact arm's broken off.<br> It could tick until Christmas<br> and not even set off a firecracker!<br> Exhibit B:<br> Exhibit B is missing.<br> All my slow burning fuses are gone.<br> Disappeared! Vanished!<br> Exhibit C: My time pencils.<br> 75 grains of fulminate of mercury<br> in each of them.<br> Enough to blow my hand off.<br> And very unstable, very delicate.<br> Which means there's<br> a traitor in this room.<br> You're crazy.<br> It happened at base.<br> No, I'm not that crazy!<br> I checked it all before I left base.<br> No, here.<br> Here!<br> Someone here.<br> But who?<br> Who?<br> This stuff's only been<br> out of my sight two times.<br> Once was when Andrea and Maria<br> took it away to hide it.<br> But it was all right<br> when we picked it up again.<br> The only other time was<br> when we left it in the truck...<br> ...and we scouted the gates.<br> All of us!<br> Except her.<br> We left her on guard in the truck...<br> ...alone.<br> You are crazy, sir!<br> Let me just think for a moment.<br> Since we got here, we've jumped<br> out of one frying pan into another.<br> Just think...<br> We were hiding in the carob grove...<br> ...and she's up in a tree. Remember?<br> Anybody can signal an airplane<br> with tin or a mirror.<br> And they found us there,<br> didn't they?<br> And then in the tunnel.<br> In the tunnel she lagged far behind,<br> with a shocking limp.<br> Seen her limping lately?<br> But being behind us,<br> she could leave some messages.<br> So when you take Roy to the doctor,<br> the Germans are waiting for you.<br> When she takes us to her place,<br> they come there.<br> But she got us out.<br> Of course! That house would be a<br> shambles and she'd be dead with us.<br> So, what does she do?<br> She disappears into the bedroom<br> to change her clothes...<br> ...and to leave a little note.<br> She takes us to the wedding<br> and we're caught...<br> ...because we can't get to our guns!<br> But even if we can, we slaughter<br> half of Mandrakos!<br> You are an insane man!<br> Am I?<br> Maybe I am.<br> Nothing surprises me anymore.<br> We can settle this thing very easily.<br> Let's see those scars<br> the Germans made on her back...<br> ...those terrible scars.<br> How about it, Maria?<br> Don't you want to see those scars?<br> Q.E.D.<br> You cannot believe it?<br> Believe it.<br> I cannot stand pain.<br> It's easy to be brave when you're free,<br> when you're with friends.<br> But I was caught.<br> The others were free but they didn't<br> help me. I was alone.<br> I was alone in their hands.<br> They said they would put me<br> into their brothels.<br> They said they would torture me.<br> I saw what they did to other people.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I cannot stand pain.<br> When we got here...<br> ...why didn't you put in with us?<br> You could have come with us!<br> It was your only chance<br> to get free of them!<br> There was never any chance.<br> You never had any chance!<br> It was hopeless from the beginning.<br> You'll never get out of here!<br> Never!<br> I tried to tell you last night.<br> Can you do anything at all?<br> I don't know.<br> There's always some way<br> to blow up explosives.<br> The trick is not to be around<br> when they go off.<br> But aren't you forgetting<br> something, captain?<br> The lady.<br> As I see it,<br> we have three choices:<br> One, we can leave her here.<br> But she might be found.<br> And in her case<br> they won't need a truth drug.<br> Two, we take her with us.<br> But that makes things more difficult.<br> And three...<br> Well, that's Andrea's choice.<br> Remember?<br> You really want<br> your pound of flesh.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I do.<br> I just couldn't manage to get<br> to sleep last night.<br> - If you're anxious to kill her, do it!<br> - I'm not anxious to kill her.<br> I'm not anxious to kill anyone.<br> See, I'm not a born soldier.<br> I got trapped.<br> You may find me facetious...<br> ...but if I didn't make some bad jokes,<br> I'd go out of my mind.<br> No, I prefer<br> to leave the killing to you.<br> An officer and a gentleman.<br> A leader of men, a hero.<br> If you think I enjoy this, you're mad!<br> I never wanted it.<br> I was trapped like you,<br> or anybody in uniform.<br> You wanted it.<br> You're an officer, aren't you?<br> I'll never want the responsibility<br> of an officer.<br> Then you've had a free ride<br> all this time.<br> Someone's got to be responsible.<br> Do you think it's easy?<br> I don't know!<br> I'm beginning to wonder who is<br> responsible to do the dirty work.<br> Is the man who gives the orders guilty,<br> or the one who has to do it?<br> - We've no time for this.<br> - Now just a minute!<br> If we're gonna get this job done,<br> she has got to be killed!<br> And we all know how keen you are<br> on getting the job done.<br> I've never killed a woman before,<br> traitor or not...<br> ...and I'm finicky.<br> So why don't you do it?<br> Why don't you let us off for once?<br> Come on, be a pal.<br> Be a father to your men.<br> Come down off your cross,<br> close your eyes and pull the trigger!<br> What do you say, sir?<br> You all know what you<br> have to do. Get started.<br> Brown, you go with Maria.<br> Now, you know when you put on<br> a uniform and learn how to do it...<br> ...it's not hard to kill anyone.<br> Sometimes it's harder not to.<br> You think you've been getting away<br> with it all this time, standing by.<br> Well, son...<br> ...your "bystanding" days are over.<br> You're in it now, up to your neck!<br> They say you're a genius with<br> explosives. Start proving it!<br> You got me in the mood<br> to use this thing...<br> ...and by God, if you don't think<br> of something, I'll use it on you!<br> I mean it.<br> Go on.<br> You stay here.<br> I'll call you if I need you.<br> Whatever you say, sir.<br> Spyro!<br> Detonators, sir, please.<br> I'll be finished here in about<br> 30 seconds.<br> Miller?<br> Miller!<br> - Miller!<br> - Yes, what is it?<br> What are you doing?<br> They'll search those guns first<br> and find my stuff.<br> They're not stupid.<br> But if they remove it carelessly,<br> they could have the same result.<br> But I'm banking on this job<br> being our insurance.<br> - What happens?<br> - Would you bring down the hoist?<br> Whoa, that's enough!<br> See this bottom runner?<br> When they send this hoist down for<br> shells or charges, it'll come here.<br> It'll hit these<br> two wires and we get a circuit...<br> ...that'll send up<br> all my plastic explosives here...<br> ...plus this little item...<br> ...that I borrowed here.<br> They won't see these wires<br> under the grease.<br> Are you sure it'll work?<br> No guarantee, but the theory's<br> perfectly feasible.<br> But if this stuff goes up...<br> ...everything else in this place<br> will go up with it.<br> Suppose you don't get a contact?<br> Then I'll be responsible for sinking<br> one of the destroyers...<br> ...maybe the whole lot of them.<br> I'm sorry, sir. It's the only way<br> I know to get the job done.<br> As you said, I'm in it now...<br> ...up to my neck.<br> Hurry up.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - After you.<br> Remember? I can't swim.<br> You won't let me drown, will you?<br> I can't make it.<br> My arm...<br> Come on, man. Take it!<br> Grab it!<br> Spyro's dead, isn't he?<br> What happened?<br> He forgot why we came here.<br> And now you're going back to Crete?<br> Yes.<br> Come with us.<br> With us?<br> With me.<br> I must go back.<br> You saw what the Germans did<br> to Mandrakos.<br> Navarone will pay heavily for<br> your success tonight.<br> Come on,<br> I'll give you a hand.<br> I'm going back.<br> The job is finished.<br> Your job is finished.<br> What chance do you think you have<br> of staying alive back there?<br> I'm not so easy to kill.<br> Hey.<br> Well, the boys on Kheros<br> will be happy soon.<br> It'll be crowded, but<br> there's nothing like an ocean voyage:<br> Fresh air, good food,<br> deck sports, pretty girls...<br> I'd like to offer you<br> my apologies...<br> ...and my congratulations.<br> The truth is,<br> I didn't think we could do it.<br> To tell you the truth,<br> neither did I.<br>
