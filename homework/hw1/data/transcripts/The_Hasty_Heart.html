                        This is Burma, 1945.<br> Mountains, jungle,<br> more mountains, more jungle.<br> A hundred miles of it. Two hundred.<br> Five hundred. A thousand.<br> Measured in inches and sweat.<br> A full-time job.<br> A dirty, relentless backbreaking job,<br> 24 hours a day.<br> Until everything blends into a weary haze,<br> and all that's important<br> is getting it over with.<br> Days become weeks,<br> the weeks become months.<br> It rains, keeps on raining.<br> Then it's blistering hot.<br> Half the year you're drowning,<br> the other half you fry.<br> This is how it is in Burma.<br> They go by endlessly,<br> Chinwits, Indians, Gurkhas,<br> Chinese, Basutos,<br> Scots, Australians, New Zealanders,<br> Americans, Canadian, English,<br> and many others.<br> Tired, dirty, indomitable.<br> There are only two classifications<br> in the jungle, friends and enemies.<br> - MacLachlan?<br> - Aye.<br> Two.<br> Keep your eye on my pipes.<br> And remember,<br> they're my own personal, private property.<br> In Burma, in 1945, the fighting,<br> working and suffering<br> have become a routine.<br> A way of life.<br> If a man falls, he's taken away.<br> The battle goes on.<br> The road to victory is a long road<br> that sometimes ends at a hospital.<br> It's been like this a long time now.<br> There's a feeling it may go on forever.<br> But there's an end to everything.<br> It's finished now. The war is over.<br> Aye? Would you repeat that, chum?<br> The war is over.<br> Blimey! Thanks. Thanks very much.<br> Hey, it's over. It's over!<br> - What's over?<br> - The war is over.<br> Hey! Hey! The war is over!<br> It's over!<br> It's over, Sarge. It's over!<br> - What?<br> - The war is over.<br> It just came through the blower.<br> The war, over! Oh, boy!<br> - Morning, Sister.<br> - Morning, Sister.<br> - Wanna come along with us?<br> - I wish I could.<br> - We're gonna miss you.<br> - I'll miss you too.<br> - What about us?<br> - I'll miss you all.<br> - Goodbye, Sister.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Bye.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, Sister.<br> The matron asked me to report<br> to Colonel Dunn.<br> - Is he up yet?<br> - Yes, I think so.<br> - I'll see if I can find him.<br> - Thank you.<br> Good morning.<br> - I'm here to see the Colonel.<br> - He isn't in at the moment.<br> I can see that. Where should I find him?<br> What is it? Perhaps I can help you.<br> I'm here to examine<br> his medical certificate.<br> - What's that?<br> - Did I not make myself clear?<br> But why?<br> Do you see they men?<br> They're going home,<br> every last man jack of them.<br> Everyone but me.<br> What may I ask is wrong with me<br> that I should be kept by force<br> in this foul-smelling den?<br> I'm sure the Colonel<br> has his reasons for keeping...<br> Aye, observation, he says.<br> But I'm hale and hearty,<br> and fit as ever I was.<br> - So why can I not go home?<br> - Now, look here.<br> I know how anxious you must be.<br> We all are. But don't you see...<br> Oh, what's the good of talking?<br> You're all the same in this army.<br> First it's days and days<br> of parading and saluting,<br> and learning how to handle<br> a deadly weapon.<br> Then it's months of waiting<br> to be shipped out.<br> Then it's 5,000 miles around the world<br> to a godforsaken spot<br> in the middle of nowhere.<br> And then, the day before the war ends,<br> I get a small wound in my back.<br> And now I'm bogged down<br> in a mass of medical red tape!<br> Yeah, I wasted my time, surely!<br> - Good morning, Sister.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - How many patients left in your ward?<br> - Five, sir.<br> Five. Should be enough.<br> What are they like?<br> - What are they like, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> Are they a decent crowd, you know?<br> - Kind, friendly, sympathetic?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> They seem to be.<br> Well, we shall just have to take it<br> for granted that it'll work out.<br> It's rather a delicate situation.<br> Now, to begin with,<br> I'm thinking of sending you over<br> a new patient this morning.<br> A young Scotsman.<br> - A Scotsman?<br> - Yes.<br> - Not the...<br> - A very decent chap. You'll like him.<br> Yes, sir.<br> But before I send him over,<br> I want you to take a look at his history.<br> Then I want you to talk to your patients.<br> It's a case that's going to call<br> for the cooperation of the entire ward.<br> - Now, come inside with me, will you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Will you call the orderly in Ward 3?<br> - Tell him the Colonel will be over shortly.<br> - Very good, Sister.<br> Now then, wakey, wakey, wakey!<br> Rise and shine. Show a leg up.<br> Patients into the washroom.<br> Come on, Tommy!<br> Get cracking, Kiwi. Yank!<br> Wake up,<br> the Colonel will be in in a few minutes.<br> Digger, let's be having you.<br> Now then, Blossom, up with you,<br> the war's over. Time to get up.<br> Blimey, would you believe it?<br> Wake up, wake up!<br> Why don't you drop dead?<br> I might even try that<br> if I thought it'd get you up.<br> Come on, come on,<br> the hospital's burning down.<br> The monsoons have started.<br> There's an air raid, there's an earthquake.<br> - You're not very funny, buster.<br> - Anything to get you blokes up.<br> Well, try and think<br> of something different tomorrow.<br> Now, do get up.<br> I'm half an hour late and the Colonel's<br> coming around early this morning.<br> - What for?<br> - How should I know?<br> Now, come and get out of it.<br> What do you think this is,<br> a blinking health resort?<br> Somebody ought<br> to do something about him.<br> - Something nasty.<br> - Yeah.<br> To be woke with a kiss and a kind word...<br> And a cup of coffee.<br> Now, here we are then.<br> Come on, come on, get a wriggle on.<br> - Yank, get Digger up.<br> - Okay, buster. Okay.<br> It's a mistake to get well<br> in an army hospital.<br> Come on, Digger, wake up.<br> The General's here to give you a medal.<br> Tell him I'm out to lunch.<br> Hey, don't look now,<br> but I think somebody's in bed with you.<br> They're mine. All mine.<br> I don't know,<br> either this bed's getting shorter<br> or I'm growing again.<br> Come on, Tommy, put a jerk into it!<br> What's the matter with you,<br> ill or something?<br> Here, what is this? Get up, Blossom.<br> Get up, or else I'll put a snake in with you.<br> Up, Blossom. Understand?<br> Blossom.<br> That's your name, all right, we hope.<br> Into the washroom.<br> - Blossom.<br> - Blossom.<br> Blimey, what a shower.<br> - Hiya, Blossom.<br> - G'day, mate.<br> Blossom.<br> That's nerve-wracking, that is.<br> Hey, drown it, will you? Drown it!<br> - Yeah, break it up, Tommy!<br> - Put a sock in it!<br> Kiwi, pull his mattress out<br> from under him.<br> Wake up, me chubby love!<br> Wake up, you mountain of flesh!<br> - Has something happened?<br> - Yes, you died.<br> - It's Judgment Day.<br> - Ah, you...<br> Snap your wings to attention.<br> Here, somebody snores in here.<br> - No.<br> - And I wonder who that could be?<br> - Who, me?<br> - Yes, you.<br> How can you make so much noise<br> in your sleep without waking yourself up?<br> I had a terrible dream last night.<br> I dreamed I was working.<br> I nearly killed myself working.<br> I'm that tired this morning,<br> I can hardly lift a finger.<br> Look at him.<br> I've seen them fat,<br> but I've never seen a man like that.<br> Aren't you uncomfortable?<br> Them's muscles, you see.<br> I just relaxed them a bit.<br> Relax them anymore<br> and you'll trip over them.<br> My old lady loves<br> every sweet ounce of me.<br> Hey, Blossom.<br> Blossom.<br> Hey, Yank,<br> why don't you teach him another word?<br> It only took him a week to learn one.<br> If he learns two words<br> they'll make him an officer.<br> He's doing all right.<br> He knows one word of English,<br> we don't know any Basuto.<br> Yank's right.<br> Those Basutos are okay.<br> And great fighters, too.<br> I was with a company once.<br> You know, they let a whole year pass<br> without drawing a cent of their pay.<br> - Why? Were they ashamed of it?<br> - No, they let it pile up.<br> So when they go home they can buy<br> themselves a wife and a herd of oxen.<br> More likely an ox and a herd of wives.<br> All right. Tea up, tea up.<br> Come on, come on, get a move on!<br> The Sister's coming.<br> We're supposed to be finished.<br> - Goodbye, Sister.<br> - Goodbye, Johnny.<br> - You made it a nice war while it lasted.<br> - Thank you.<br> Good morning, Alfie.<br> - Good morning, good morning.<br> - Good morning, Sister.<br> - How is everyone this morning?<br> - Oh, good, I would think.<br> Tea up, Sister?<br> This tea tastes like<br> a baby's been boiled in it.<br> - Here, this is for you.<br> - Oh, thanks, Sister.<br> - Haven't you finished yet?<br> - Well, not quite, Sister.<br> Why not?<br> Weren't you told about the Colonel?<br> - Yes, but I...<br> - All right, then hurry up.<br> Let's see if we can get this place<br> looking a little less like a foxhole.<br> All right.<br> Oh, Jennings, after you're through<br> I want you to go to Ward 7.<br> There's a young Scotsman<br> who's coming here.<br> - Help him with his things.<br> - All right, Sister.<br> Did you say a Scotsman was coming here?<br> Yes. Now, hurry up,<br> the Colonel will be here soon.<br> What does Old Cobwebs want<br> this time of morning?<br> You will please show a little more respect<br> for the commanding officer.<br> You will not refer to Cobwebs...<br> To the Colonel as Old Cobwebs.<br> Anything for you, sweetheart.<br> I think you're getting well.<br> So, we're going to have a Scot in here.<br> It'll make a change<br> from looking at your ugly mug.<br> That's all I need, is a Scot.<br> - What's that?<br> - Well, let's have a look.<br> The fellas in number seven.<br> They're going home today.<br> Home. That must be a good feeling.<br> Hey, that must be the Scots bloke.<br> - I wonder why they didn't take him along?<br> - I don't know.<br> But I don't like him even from here.<br> What's the matter?<br> Don't you get along with the Scots?<br> I do not.<br> And I don't know anyone else who does,<br> except another Scot.<br> - Well, Sister's a Scot, isn't she?<br> - She is not.<br> She taught school there<br> for awhile, kindergarten.<br> After three months of trying to teach<br> a bunch of young Scots to speak English,<br> she had a nervous breakdown.<br> Well, she's fine, whatever she is.<br> She's lovely. Bless her little heart.<br> - What have you got against the Scots?<br> - I'm Scottish myself. Scotch descent.<br> You should've known<br> my grandfather, Angus.<br> There were two infallible beings<br> to his way of thinking.<br> Angus McDonald and God.<br> Sometimes God was wrong,<br> but never Grandfather Angus.<br> You know what he'd make me do<br> every time I lost my temper?<br> - No, what?<br> - Recite the books of the Bible.<br> - Get away.<br> - You didn't.<br> Well, I can still do it.<br> Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,<br> Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,<br> Samuel, Kings, Chronicles,<br> Ezra, Nehemiah,<br> Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs,<br> Ecclesiastes, Solomon,<br> Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations,<br> Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos,<br> Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum,<br> Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,<br> Zechariah, and Malachi!<br> You wonder why I hate the Scots.<br> He must've been a terror,<br> your grandfather.<br> You know what he'd do<br> if you got the best of him in an argument?<br> He'd pretend he didn't hear you<br> and start playing his bagpipes.<br> How I learned to hate bagpipes!<br> Now I know why the Scots<br> always march when they play them.<br> They're trying to get away from the sound.<br> Yes, sir, if it were humanly possible<br> for me to get rid of my Scottish blood,<br> I'd donate it all to the Red Cross!<br> Sister, don't look now,<br> but the Colonel just left his office.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> - Jennings, finish with those beds.<br> - Right.<br> - Get those nets rolled.<br> - Come on, Tommy, be quick.<br> Well, I'm doing my best.<br> Here, hide these under<br> the covers with you.<br> - He'll think I'm bloated, Sister.<br> - You can say that again.<br> Blossom, Blossom, line up the beds.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> Sit down.<br> - You keep a nice, tidy ward, Sister.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Have you told them anything?<br> - No, sir.<br> Just that he's coming here.<br> - You're getting fatter.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I didn't think it was possible.<br> - Well, how's the face?<br> - Better, thank you, sir.<br> We shall have to get that beard<br> off you one day.<br> - See what you really look like.<br> - Oh, don't do that, sir.<br> Well, as the Sister's told you,<br> I'm sending over a new patient.<br> I came here this morning<br> to enlist your help with him.<br> Our help, sir?<br> - Yes. You see...<br> - What sort of help, sir?<br> - You're the American, aren't you?<br> - Yes, sir. Ambulance driver.<br> Got malaria in the British zone,<br> been here ever since.<br> Sort of reverse lend-lease, sir.<br> I see. Well, you can help, too.<br> Sit down.<br> Now, about this patient.<br> We did an emergency operation on him.<br> The day war ended, poor beggar.<br> Took a piece of shrapnel out of him,<br> had to remove a kidney.<br> He's about recovered from the operation,<br> but I think you could help him.<br> - In what way, sir?<br> - By keeping him contented.<br> You see, he wants to go home,<br> as we all do, but as far as he's concerned<br> that's quite out of the question.<br> You and I,<br> all of us will be leaving here soon,<br> but not this man.<br> He'll die here.<br> But you said he'd about recovered, sir.<br> And so he has, from the operation itself.<br> That's not the difficulty.<br> You see, he has one kidney left.<br> Now normally<br> that would carry him through life.<br> Unfortunately,<br> we've discovered that it's defective.<br> For a very limited time it'll do<br> the work of two, then collapse.<br> Uremic poisoning will set in,<br> and that's the end.<br> - Does the patient know this, sir?<br> - No.<br> No, I decided against telling him.<br> First, I couldn't,<br> and later it seemed a good idea<br> not to tell him at all.<br> He has no family, no ties,<br> and worry won't help.<br> I'm placing him here because,<br> well, it seems to me<br> that a man should have friends<br> around him when he dies.<br> That's your job.<br> To be friends with him, make him...<br> Make him happy.<br> How long has he got, sir?<br> Well, that's very difficult to say.<br> Not more than a few weeks.<br> And nothing can help him, sir?<br> The only help anyone can give him<br> now will come from you.<br> Well?<br> - We'll try to make it easy for him, sir.<br> - We'll do our best, sir.<br> He won't learn he's due<br> to kick off from us, sir.<br> They're good men, sir.<br> You can rely on them.<br> Thank you. Thank you all.<br> It's a pity it has to be like this.<br> Most unfortunate.<br> - It's a shocker.<br> - It's always a shocker.<br> A few weeks, he said.<br> Blimey, we'll just get to know him.<br> Why can't a bloke live without a kidney?<br> He can get along all right without a brain.<br> - Hey, Yank?<br> - Yeah?<br> Would you want to know it?<br> If you were going to die?<br> I am going to die, someday.<br> I'd just as soon let<br> God surprise me though.<br> - Are you sure you don't want any help?<br> - I need no help!<br> - Come on, mate...<br> - I told you, I need no help!<br> Here he is, Sister.<br> - Why'd you let him carry all that?<br> - He wouldn't let me touch it.<br> We didn't introduce ourselves<br> this morning. I'm Sister Parker.<br> It's nice to have you here.<br> Lachlan MacLachlan, that's a nice name.<br> You're a Scot, aren't you?<br> I'd hardly be called MacLachlan<br> if I were not a Scot.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Quite a few parents give their children<br> Scottish names because they like them.<br> Aye, it deceives no one.<br> Parading under false pretenses.<br> Well, I doubt if it's a deliberate<br> plot against the Scots.<br> I presume we've exhausted<br> this topic of conversation.<br> Is there aught more you want of me?<br> I guess not.<br> Come along. We'll find you a bed.<br> This way, please.<br> Now, boys, this is our new patient,<br> Corporal Lachlan MacLachlan.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> I know you're all going to be great friends.<br> - Yeah. Of course we are.<br> - Yes.<br> You'll find that Corporal MacLachlan<br> has a wonderful sense of humor.<br> - Yank, would you fix him up with a bed?<br> - Sure.<br> I do not like to have things done for me.<br> Don't you?<br> I love to have things done for me.<br> You may. Not I.<br> The Colonel said you could sit up<br> if you wanted to, or get into bed and rest.<br> I'll sit and think a bit.<br> Just as you like.<br> Here, buster, try this one.<br> The last fella that had it<br> was a light sleeper. No bumps.<br> I'll take this one.<br> - Want a smoke?<br> - I've my own.<br> Go on. Take one of these,<br> they're not issue. I got them from home.<br> - I do not accept presents.<br> - Why not?<br> I've no wish to put myself<br> in any man's debt.<br> Well, a cigarette isn't gonna<br> put you very deep in debt.<br> I'll smoke my own.<br> Okay.<br> Hey, Jock.<br> He's talking to you.<br> My name's no Jock!<br> All Scots are Jock to me.<br> If you must address me,<br> you'll use my proper name.<br> Well, I... I heard Sister call you something,<br> but I didn't catch it.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's Lachlan something.<br> All right, Lachie. How's that?<br> - What did you want?<br> - I thought you might feel like talking.<br> - About such as?<br> - Well, nothing. Just talk.<br> I place little value on talking of nothing.<br> He's a Scot all right.<br> Hey, Lachie!<br> You... You may have noticed<br> I'm a bit... A bit plump.<br> - Aye.<br> - Well, I shouldn't eat this stuff.<br> Here, you give it to him, Yank.<br> Here you are, buster.<br> May I be so bold as to ask<br> what you're thrusting on my person?<br> Well, it's a bar of chocolate.<br> Don't you want it?<br> Is it no good?<br> Well, of course it's good. It's very good.<br> What do you think<br> he's giving it to you for?<br> Well, why are you?<br> Well, I want it,<br> but I thought you might want it more.<br> Is that an insult?<br> It's not consistent.<br> Grandfather Angus rides again.<br> Hey, Lachie, would you like<br> a book to read?<br> I place little value on books.<br> They're a waste of a thinking man's time.<br> - Oh, so you're a thinking man?<br> - Aye.<br> Well, you're also a bit small<br> to be so unpleasant.<br> When you get that thing off your arm<br> I'll show you how unpleasant I can be.<br> Small as I am.<br> What regiment were you with, Lachie?<br> - Why do you ask?<br> - Just curious.<br> Thought I might know somebody<br> in your outfit.<br> Are you a Scot?<br> No, but my grandfather was.<br> I think it unlikely you'd find<br> your grandfather in my regiment.<br> Look, buster,<br> I know where my grandfather is,<br> he's in the family plot where he belongs.<br> But I was an ambulance driver,<br> got around quite a bit.<br> I thought we might have<br> some friends in common.<br> Most unlikely. I do not make friends freely.<br> You don't make friends, period!<br> - Well, how are we getting along?<br> - Great. We're all buddies.<br> Well, Lachie, how was supper?<br> I do not consider soybeans<br> fit for human consumption.<br> I suppose you like haggis better?<br> What do you know of haggis?<br> You're not a Scot, are you?<br> No, I'm Canadian.<br> But I once taught school in Scotland.<br> - Do you happen to know Ayrshire?<br> - You looked on my card.<br> - I was born in Ayrshire.<br> - No.<br> Now, if you tell me you belong to the<br> Cameron Highlanders I won't believe you.<br> - Aye, I do.<br> - You don't.<br> Have you trouble<br> with your hearing, Sister?<br> Oh, they're a grand regiment.<br> You wear the Erracht kilt, don't you?<br> - Them as does, do.<br> - Would you wear it for us?<br> Wouldn't you boys like<br> to see Lachie in his kilt?<br> Do we have a choice?<br> Oh, you must put it on.<br> With your cap cocked over one eye<br> and your kilt swishing<br> as you walk down the street,<br> you must be the proudest man<br> in the world.<br> I do not have a kilt.<br> - You must have a kilt.<br> - I do not must at all.<br> But you said you belonged<br> to the Camerons?<br> We're required to pay<br> for the kilt ourselves.<br> And there's a great cost to a proper kilt.<br> If I were in your regiment I'd buy the finest<br> to be had, no matter what it costs.<br> Being a woman, you would.<br> I put my money to better use.<br> It's in Scotland.<br> In the earth.<br> I knew it! He's got it buried in a tin can!<br> Would you care to have me<br> rattle your jaw with my fist!<br> Oh, relax, buster.<br> You wouldn't hit a man with malaria,<br> would you?<br> Yank, if you're not well,<br> lie down and be quiet. And please be civil.<br> Go on, Lachie.<br> I'll not return to Scotland with naught<br> but wounds to show for my time.<br> I've invested my money in a bit of land.<br> I'll be a landowner when I go home.<br> Oh.<br> Now, why you say "Oh"?<br> What on earth is finer than a farm?<br> Land of your own to work on.<br> Spend the rest of your life content.<br> And is your land about paid for?<br> A couple of months<br> and my farm's my own.<br> Lachie, why don't you<br> do something very foolish?<br> Why don't you buy yourself a kilt?<br> I can tell you want one,<br> and the land will wait.<br> The kilt will wait.<br> Are you going<br> to share your farm with someone?<br> I share with no one.<br> - You're going to live all by yourself?<br> - Aye.<br> And you won't be lonely?<br> I've never been lonely in my life.<br> And now, if you don't mind,<br> you're keeping me awake.<br> What's more, you're wasting<br> a good deal of my time in idle chatter.<br> Yes. I guess I am.<br> All right, get your nets down.<br> - Right-o, Sister.<br> - Good night, Sister.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Look, buster, do you mind<br> if I ask you just one question?<br> I'll grant you one.<br> What are you so griped about?<br> Would you be so kind<br> as to speak the King's English?<br> Buster, I've got a parrot<br> talks better English than you do.<br> A pity you didn't learn<br> from your parrot then.<br> I just wanna know what you're sore at.<br> When people try to be friendly,<br> why can't you be nice?<br> Who's being friendly?<br> Well, the Sister for one,<br> and us too for that matter.<br> Well, you should've told me,<br> I could've saved you time and trouble.<br> I place no value on casual friendships.<br> I do not like to have<br> my freedom nibbled into.<br> Just what do you put a value on?<br> If you'd use your God-given wits,<br> you wouldn't need ask.<br> - I value my privacy. Do you mind?<br> - Well, you can have it.<br> You can sit in your own private world<br> and hug yourself to death.<br> As far as we're concerned, brother,<br> you won't exist!<br> If you do not mind, I'm not your brother!<br> Somebody give me a dull razor,<br> I think I'll cut my throat.<br> Hey, Yank, Sister's gonna take<br> a dim view of this.<br> Well, he asked for it, didn't he?<br> He's getting just what he wants.<br> All right. Good night, Kiwi.<br> - Good night, Blossom.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Digger.<br> - Good night, fellas.<br> What was that?<br> Don't you look at me.<br> Bagpipes!<br> Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,<br> Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,<br> Samuel, Kings...<br> - Hey, I'll be leaving here soon.<br> - I know.<br> Who's gonna carry things for you<br> after I'm gone?<br> I have no idea.<br> You'll find somebody.<br> Yes, I suppose I will.<br> Please put that in my office.<br> - Who wants mail?<br> - I do.<br> That's what we've been waiting for.<br> - One for you, Digger.<br> - Sister, you're an angel.<br> - You got one for me?<br> - Well, somebody loves you.<br> - Any more, Sister?<br> - Yes, here's one. Here's two for you.<br> Any more, Sister? You're an angel.<br> I don't know what can be happening<br> to your mail, Lachie.<br> Unless they're holding it<br> at your regimental headquarters.<br> I expect no mail.<br> Don't your friends know where you are?<br> - You do have friends, don't you, Lachie?<br> - Aye, many friends.<br> Very carefully chosen individuals<br> in various parts of the world.<br> However, they all know my views<br> and I'm fully acquainted with theirs.<br> Still, it's nice to know what's<br> happening back home sometimes.<br> My knowing will not change anything.<br> I see.<br> Lachie, is there anything special<br> you'd like for tea?<br> No, nothing.<br> Well, there must be something you'd like.<br> Something I can fix for you myself.<br> - Why?<br> - Why do you ask why?<br> I've noticed, Sister,<br> you seek to do me favors.<br> I do not ken your motive,<br> but I think it only fair to warn you,<br> I've no place for marriage in my plans.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> - I thought you might as well know.<br> - How kind of you to tell me.<br> But I assure you, Lachie,<br> I have no desire to marry you.<br> - None at all.<br> - Aye, so you say.<br> Now that you ken it's no use.<br> I only ask you about the food<br> because I thought something<br> a little different might please you.<br> May I remind you that I do not like<br> to have things done for me!<br> And I do not seek privilege.<br> Lachie, we're all entitled<br> to privilege every once in a while.<br> When I have a right for privilege,<br> I'll not ask for it. I'll demand it.<br> You are aggravating.<br> Why don't you make an effort<br> to be human?<br> I'm sorry I cannot be a weak character<br> to your liking.<br> So am I.<br> At least it's something I can understand.<br> - Lachie, I'm sorry I was cross with you.<br> - I do not notice the tantrums of women.<br> That will be such an advantage<br> if you ever marry!<br> It's odd how you harp on marriage.<br> Lachie, will you please believe me?<br> I'm not setting a trap for you.<br> I have no designs on you.<br> I'm gonna be strong<br> and resist your charm.<br> I would just like to know<br> if I can prepare any special dish for you.<br> I'll take what comes.<br> - I've had a baby!<br> - Did you suffer much?<br> - Boy or girl?<br> - A boy!<br> She's named it after me!<br> - Congrats, Kiwi boy!<br> - Thanks, Tommy mate!<br> - Good on you, Kiwi.<br> - And he's kicking well?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Blimey, boy!<br> Hey, did you hear that?<br> I've had a baby! A baby!<br> Blossom.<br> Yeah!<br> I've had a baby.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Yeah, come on, spill it.<br> His mother-in-law died.<br> Oh, oh, dear, oh, dear.<br> They've had a dinner in me honor.<br> Me old woman's told them all<br> about my wound.<br> I'm a hero!<br> They've named a pudding after me!<br> I bet it's a heavy one!<br> A fine lot of women you must have!<br> What's wrong with you?<br> Have you any idea of the tons of paper<br> that's wasted writing such drivel?<br> Have you ever considered<br> the fortune in stamps<br> that could be spent on food instead?<br> Do you ken the number of ships<br> and planes it takes to deliver the letters<br> of millions of giddy females?<br> You're guilty of criminal waste,<br> you and your women.<br> Do us a favor, buster.<br> Don't show us the error of our ways.<br> Why don't you try<br> running the world for a bit?<br> Okay, it's your conscience troubles you,<br> not I.<br> Okay, so it's our conscience.<br> Oh, somebody give him asthma.<br> Lachie, the Colonel just called.<br> He wants to see you in his office.<br> - What does he want?<br> - I believe he wants to take an X-ray.<br> - Would you like someone to go with you?<br> - I need no one.<br> My legs and my health<br> have little respect for the Colonel.<br> - He's got a spite on me.<br> - That's not true, Lachie.<br> Well, why else should I be kept here?<br> My operation has mended,<br> and I've recovered from his butchery.<br> And yet there's never any mention<br> of letting me go home. Why?<br> I'll tell you.<br> I'm a Scot with a mind of my own.<br> Something no Englishman can abide.<br> Is he really gonna die, Sister?<br> Because if he isn't,<br> I'm thinking of killing him.<br> Yank, that's a dreadful thing to say.<br> - Well, you don't have to live with him.<br> - Hear, hear.<br> Why don't you try to understand him?<br> - Understand him?<br> - To understand him is to loathe him.<br> He's a terrible, stern man, he is, Sister.<br> We've all tried to get along with him,<br> Sister, but you can't touch him.<br> Now, listen to me, he wasn't sent here<br> to make things pleasant for you.<br> He was sent here for your help.<br> And whether you like him or not<br> is unimportant.<br> I admit, I lose patience, too.<br> - But we mustn't stop trying.<br> - But you can't get near him, Sister.<br> He doesn't know the meaning<br> of the word friendship,<br> and he doesn't want to.<br> If you're nice to him, he thinks<br> you're trying to steal something from him.<br> - Right.<br> - Aren't we all like that sometimes?<br> Don't we all suspect people's motives<br> and try to shut them out?<br> Yeah, but with him it's a disease.<br> He's got a spite<br> against the whole world, Sister.<br> And do you know why?<br> You know what kind of life he's had?<br> He tells everyone he's an orphan.<br> That's not true.<br> He was a foundling.<br> His mother wasn't married.<br> Do you know what that means?<br> He sure is.<br> Yank, I'm serious.<br> Lachie's probably worked<br> since he was old enough to walk.<br> Because his mother was foolish,<br> he spent all that time with no friends<br> and nothing but ridicule<br> from everyone around him.<br> Of course he suspects us.<br> Of course he hates the world<br> and everything in it. Why shouldn't he?<br> What's it ever meant to him<br> but bitterness and sorrow?<br> Even here now, when he's dying?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I reckon we're not much good, Sister.<br> What do you want us to do?<br> I'm gonna give you a chance<br> to redeem yourselves.<br> Today's his birthday.<br> - Oh, is it?<br> - I wanna give him a party.<br> - How old is he?<br> - He's 24, I looked on the record.<br> Now, what about the party?<br> I need your help.<br> Well, look, boys,<br> it isn't often you have an opportunity<br> to make a man grateful he spent<br> the last weeks of his life with you.<br> Remember, you're going to get well.<br> He's not.<br> - We'll do what we can.<br> - We might as well have a go at it, Sister!<br> Yank?<br> - We'll give him a party.<br> - Thanks.<br> And he better enjoy himself,<br> or we'll beat him to death<br> with those bagpipes.<br> - Hey, Sister, what about presents?<br> - Oh, I've got that arranged, too.<br> - Come on, Blossom.<br> - Bring the gorilla, Kiwi.<br> Now, here are the presents.<br> - Hey, it's a kilt!<br> - That's right.<br> A Cameron Highlander's kilt, complete.<br> The RAF brought it<br> all the way from Calcutta.<br> You did all that for him, Sister?<br> That ought to make him happy,<br> if nothing else does!<br> Say, wait a minute.<br> You're not gonna pay for all this yourself?<br> - Yes. But I want you to give it to him.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - lf we give it to him, we pay for it.<br> - That's right.<br> Sister, if that's a pricelist,<br> why don't you let us<br> pick out what we can afford?<br> - I think that's a very good idea.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Right. Come on!<br> - Let's get at it.<br> - All right, Blossom.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I think I'll give him the brogues, Sister.<br> - Good.<br> What about you, Kiwi?<br> - Hey, I could use a pair of these myself.<br> - Kiwi?<br> I'll give him the spats, and the stockings.<br> - I'll give him the belt, Sister. All right?<br> - All right.<br> - Thanks, Sister.<br> - Belt might do him a lot of good.<br> Well, what about you, Yank?<br> Well, if nobody objects,<br> I'll give him that jacket and skirt.<br> - Kilt, you Red Indian.<br> - All right, kilt.<br> I'd hoped you would.<br> Well, after all, I dislike him more<br> than the rest of you.<br> - How do you know this will fit?<br> - It will.<br> I checked everything with his regiment.<br> - Hey, what about Blossom?<br> - Hey! Mustn't leave old Blossom out!<br> Here, Blossom can give him the cap.<br> Go on, Blossom.<br> Blossom!<br> Hey, Sister, you better grab that quick.<br> Oh, Blossom, wait. Blossom.<br> It's for him. Him. Gift. Gift.<br> I feel like such an idiot.<br> - Kiwi, will you get it for me?<br> - I'll try.<br> - Oh, sure. Just go over and ask him for it.<br> - Yes, it's no risk, much.<br> We'll pick you up.<br> Here, Blossom, you haven't been<br> working on your beads lately.<br> - Pretty good, boy.<br> - I'm sorry, Blossom.<br> - What are you giving him, Sister?<br> - The sporran.<br> And that's everything.<br> - What is it?<br> - He keeps his small change in it.<br> Mixed with fish hooks, no doubt.<br> - Get your presents out of sight.<br> - Okay, Sister.<br> - Hey, fellas.<br> - Oh, what?<br> Didn't she forget something?<br> Something important?<br> What?<br> Well, don't they wear some kind<br> of fancy pants under this?<br> - Didn't you know?<br> - What?<br> Are you kidding?<br> - Well, it's a bit drafty isn't it?<br> - Drafty? It's indecent.<br> It's not indecent, just thrifty.<br> Oh, they must wear some kind<br> of diaper or something.<br> - Well, something.<br> - Nothing.<br> Get away.<br> Ten bucks says you're wrong.<br> - How much is that in real money?<br> - L2.<br> - Couple a quid, you're wrong.<br> - Well, at L2, the Yank's right.<br> - I'll take that, Kiwi.<br> - All right, you're on.<br> I'm telling you they're<br> the most haughty race.<br> Boys, please,<br> hurry and put those things away.<br> - He's coming back.<br> - All right, Sister.<br> - Digger, pour some more tea.<br> - Okay, Sister.<br> After all, this is supposed to be a surprise.<br> - Get the cups.<br> - All right, Sister.<br> - When do we give him the presents?<br> - I'll let you know.<br> - Am I big enough to give him his belt?<br> - Well, don't throw it at him.<br> How do we know<br> he'll accept these things?<br> He will, it's his birthday.<br> Well, there I was doing a bit<br> of plumbing in Buckingham Palace.<br> I was in the Royal Engineers<br> at the time, of course.<br> Well, I remember, it was raining that day.<br> And the King comes up to me and he says,<br> "Where's your hat at, my good man?"<br> So, I says, "We haven't been issued<br> with no hat, Your Royal Majesty."<br> So, he says, "Here, take my crown,<br> keep the rain out of your eyes."<br> I... I heard it was your birthday, Lachie.<br> Thought you may be able<br> to use a pair of brogues.<br> Congratulations.<br> Well, you can't wear the brogues<br> without the stockings,<br> or you'll get corns.<br> Good luck, Lachie.<br> Well, Lachie, seeing as how<br> it's your birthday, I thought...<br> I...<br> Here, look, Lachie.<br> Look, it says, "Made in Scotland," see?<br> Happy birthday.<br> I wish we had a haggis for you, Lachie.<br> I hope you have a very happy birthday.<br> God bless you.<br> All the best to you, Lachie.<br> Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers...<br> I wanna have a word with you.<br> I don't understand you.<br> I do not understand myself.<br> You've done a thing that numbs my brain.<br> No man in all my life before<br> give me tuppence for nothing.<br> Or a kind word for a kick.<br> Forgot it was my birthday.<br> I wouldn't have remembered<br> if it weren't for you.<br> I thank you. One and all.<br> Digger.<br> But have I the right to take your kilt?<br> The taking lays a claim on me.<br> I must make it very plain to you,<br> I have no way to return your kindness.<br> So I must not make a mistake.<br> They say that sorrow<br> is born in the hasty heart.<br> Now, I've no wish to invite sorrow,<br> - so my problem is...<br> - Oh, Lachie, do be quiet.<br> For once in your life,<br> be hasty and risk a mistake.<br> But I must explain my feelings.<br> You don't have to explain anything.<br> Keep your mouth shut<br> and let your heart talk.<br> When a Scot makes a fool of himself,<br> he makes a big one.<br> Blow.<br> Take one.<br> - Is he gonna keep the kilt, Sister?<br> - Of course he is.<br> You were just searching<br> for a dignified way<br> to thank them, weren't you, Lachie?<br> Good boy.<br> Lachie, we were having a little discussion,<br> you could probably help us out.<br> Do you or don't you<br> wear something under the kilt?<br> Yank, what a question!<br> - No! We bet on it.<br> - We got a bet on it, Sister.<br> It's a very silly bet.<br> On behalf of general knowledge.<br> Well, Lachie?<br> My friends, I deeply regret<br> you've asked, for I cannot tell you.<br> It's the one question<br> no Scot will answer rightly.<br> - Now look, Lachie.<br> - Come on, Lachie.<br> Never mind, Lachie.<br> Just slip it on, let's see how it fits.<br> - Yeah. Good idea.<br> - Come on.<br> I have no intention of wearing my kilt<br> until the proper time.<br> You mean you're not gonna<br> let us see you in it?<br> I'll wear my kilt<br> when the occasion is fitting.<br> I'll put it on the day I leave here.<br> Not before.<br> Sister, you're not gonna<br> let him get away with that.<br> It's Lachie's birthday,<br> he can do what he pleases.<br> I'm pleased to wait.<br> Well, I guess the party's over.<br> Is there more to do?<br> No, buster, that's all.<br> A perfect Scottish birthday party.<br> Tommy.<br> You're sleeping on your back again.<br> - Roll over.<br> - Yes, my love.<br> - Lachie?<br> - Aye?<br> What are you doing out here?<br> You should be in bed.<br> I had a problem.<br> My brain gave me no peace.<br> What's worrying you? Perhaps I can help.<br> Well, it's not easy for a man<br> of my strong character<br> to admit he might have blundered.<br> I'm not what you think I am, Sister.<br> Are you sure you know what I think?<br> You undoubtedly<br> think me wise and shrewd.<br> I daresay you think<br> there's nothing confuses me.<br> Is that what I think?<br> It's what I thought myself until today.<br> You see, Sister,<br> I've not always liked the human race.<br> I had no love or respect for any man.<br> I had no faith in the goodness of people.<br> And the war came and did not help.<br> It only proved what I'd been thinking.<br> But you told me you had many friends<br> in Scotland<br> and various other parts of the world.<br> - Remember?<br> - Oh, I lied.<br> How could I have friends?<br> I had no education.<br> Being as poor as a church mouse,<br> I had no money to squander.<br> And there was always the fact that I was...<br> Well, well, there were<br> other reasons as well.<br> So I kept to myself.<br> I thought no one liked me,<br> and there was no one I liked.<br> I did not ken a man could be your friend<br> and not want something from you.<br> I ended up hating the whole world<br> and everyone in it.<br> I tell you, Sister, I despaired.<br> You mustn't think you were alone, Lachie.<br> We've all felt that way at times.<br> That's good to hear.<br> In my blindness and my rage<br> I was wicked enough to think<br> that only I knew the meaning of suffering.<br> And now I'm twenty-four years old,<br> and for the first time today<br> it occurred to me<br> I've never really been alive before.<br> I've been a poor dour man with nothing<br> in my favor, and no reason to exist.<br> - Don't, Lachie, you mustn't talk like that.<br> - Aye, but it's true, girl.<br> And I've got to do something about it.<br> I owe so much.<br> If it's the goodness of my fellow man<br> I've wronged,<br> well, I must make up for it.<br> Lachie, if you feel you've made a mistake,<br> you don't have to rush out<br> - and pay for it immediately.<br> - But, it's like repentance, Sister.<br> I've got a terrible need to help.<br> It's a great torment to me.<br> If there was only something I could...<br> There's my farm,<br> - maybe I could share it in some way.<br> - Slowly, Lachie.<br> Remember, sorrow is born<br> in the hasty heart.<br> Well, I'm not hasty. I know my duty.<br> And I've made up my mind.<br> Everything I own, my farm and all,<br> I'll share with my fellow man.<br> Lachie, I...<br> Oh, it's a great relief to me.<br> Do you know something, Sister,<br> if I had not stopped my bit of shrapnel,<br> I'd never have known<br> I could be so content with myself.<br> I had to be hurt to learn.<br> Oh, I don't think you had to be hurt,<br> but there was good in it.<br> I've come to the conclusion<br> the world would be a healthier place<br> if more people were sick.<br> Well, I don't know about that.<br> Come on, back to bed with you.<br> Aye.<br> How have you felt today?<br> - It's odd you should ask that.<br> - It's one of my duties.<br> I thought you had read my mind.<br> I've a wee weariness.<br> My hands sweat a bit,<br> and my feet seem swollen.<br> You've been thinking too much.<br> Could be I'm not used to thinking.<br> Sister, could I move my bed<br> in the morning?<br> I think there's a bit more breeze<br> at that end.<br> - I don't see why not.<br> - Thank you.<br> Lachie, it just occurred to me.<br> If you want to share something<br> with your fellow man,<br> instead of the things you own,<br> why don't you share yourself?<br> - Share myself?<br> - Yes.<br> Tell them about yourself.<br> About, well, where you live<br> and the things you've done,<br> what you like. They'll be richer for it.<br> I know I am, for the things<br> you've shared with me already.<br> - You cannot mean me, Sister.<br> - But I do.<br> As a human being,<br> I don't suppose<br> I have any real individuality.<br> I'm the people I've met.<br> I'm a mixture of everything<br> I've ever read or seen.<br> I'm everyone I ever loved.<br> And you've taken something from me?<br> Without your knowing it.<br> Sister,<br> do you ken you've given me something,<br> too, without your knowing it?<br> Something I've never had before.<br> Something that makes me know<br> when you come into the room.<br> Even when I can't see you.<br> Lachie, have you been as happy with us<br> as you've ever been in your life?<br> I think I've shared a moment with kings.<br> That's very sweet.<br> - Good night, Lachie.<br> - Good night, Sister.<br> You're a lovely, lovely angel.<br> I shouldn't have done that.<br> I had no right.<br> No right at all.<br> And you may recall,<br> when a humble Member of the House<br> asked Parliament for thruppence<br> to be added to the old-age pension,<br> what happens?<br> You'd have thought the government<br> would've been asked<br> to throw away the crown jewels!<br> Their Lordships leaped to their feet<br> like jack-in-the-boxes.<br> "Bankrupt the empire," they shouts!<br> For thruppence, mind you!<br> - Thruppence to help the poor.<br> - Very interesting, Lachie. Very interesting.<br> Why don't you talk to Yank.<br> He knows more about politics than I do.<br> "Where will the money come from?"<br> says the Prime Minister.<br> You cannot get blood from a turnip.<br> But do you happen to know how much<br> His Majesty's government<br> - spent daily to persecute the war?<br> - Why don't you relax, buster?<br> - You haven't stopped talking for a week.<br> - But do you know?<br> - Well, it must've been plenty.<br> - Aye!<br> Over a million pounds a day.<br> A million pounds!<br> And where did the money come from<br> in the first place, eh? Eh?<br> - You cannot answer, can you?<br> - Blossom.<br> Well, I'll tell you.<br> They ups and print it. That's what they do.<br> Do you realize how much it costs<br> to train each soldier put into the field?<br> Ten thousand pounds a piece!<br> Now, if they'd given just a half of that<br> to each man on both sides,<br> they could've stopped the war<br> in two minutes<br> and cut the national debt in half.<br> Look, Lachie, my lad,<br> if it's votes you're after,<br> you can have mine and welcome.<br> Tommy?<br> - Could I have a minute of your time?<br> - Why, of course.<br> Hey, it occurred to me<br> that when we go home<br> you might like a place to visit<br> and rest a bit.<br> Well, as you ken,<br> I've got a wee place in Scotland.<br> There'd always be tobacco to smoke<br> and bread to eat.<br> And a good chair of your own<br> to sit and talk in.<br> Why, thanks for the offer, Lachie.<br> But if I'm to get away from my old woman,<br> I'll have to go further than Scotland.<br> But you'd like Ayrshire.<br> It's not a hasty offer.<br> Oh, I'm very grateful to you.<br> But it's me for old London.<br> Remember now, if you ever come<br> to the city, my wife's home is yours.<br> - Kiwi?<br> - Yeah?<br> Have you got a job waiting for you<br> back home?<br> Nothing definite,<br> but now I got Kiwi Junior.<br> Well, have you ever thought<br> of looking for work in Scotland?<br> Good Lord, no, has anyone?<br> Well, as you no doubt recall,<br> I've got a bit of land<br> with a wee house on it.<br> And you're most welcome to it,<br> for you and your family.<br> - Oh, well, I...<br> - There'd be no charge.<br> Well, no thanks, Lachie.<br> When I turn in my pay book<br> I'm heading in one direction only,<br> New Zealand.<br> When I think of it,<br> it gives me a toothache in my heart.<br> But I'll visit you someday, when I get rich.<br> When you're rich you'll need no help.<br> I'll not see you again.<br> Don't worry, I'll never get that rich.<br> Are you having trouble<br> with the mosquitoes, Digger?<br> Yeah, it's a wonder I haven't got malaria.<br> - Could you not sleep with your socks on?<br> - That wouldn't make any difference.<br> Those little monsters would<br> just gang up and pull them off.<br> They seem to think my feet<br> are a blood bank.<br> Hey, there are no mosquitoes<br> to speak of in Scotland.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Aye.<br> That's interesting.<br> I dare say they're quite ferocious<br> where you're from.<br> Oh, terrible.<br> - Well, then why don't...<br> - But Australian mosquitoes<br> can have all my blood they want.<br> When I get home nothing's<br> ever going to get me away again.<br> - You really must go home?<br> - Afraid so, Lachie.<br> Did you ever transplant anything<br> and manage to get all the roots<br> out of the ground?<br> Aye, that's true.<br> Blossom?<br> Would you like to...<br> They'd not understand you in Scotland.<br> Lachie?<br> Get Sister.<br> Sister, it's Lachie.<br> I do not ken what came over me.<br> - What happened?<br> - He keeled over.<br> - He'd been walking about too much.<br> - And talking too much.<br> You do talk when you get started.<br> But a man must walk and talk a bit.<br> He's not a vegetable.<br> - Take his shoes off.<br> - I'm all right now.<br> No, you aren't.<br> You must lie down and rest.<br> - But I just got up.<br> - Did you hear me?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I'll get you some medicine.<br> Remember, no more speeches.<br> But I was just giving my friends<br> the benefit of my experience.<br> Take it easy, Lachie.<br> Hey, why don't you roll over?<br> I'll give you a rub.<br> - I'll get the alcohol.<br> - Go on, Lachie, it'll do you good, boy.<br> Thanks.<br> Here you are.<br> - Do you think you'll be all right, Lachie?<br> - Of course he'll be all right.<br> Come on outside,<br> we'll get a bit of fresh air.<br> - Yeah, that's an idea.<br> - Hey, Blossom, come on.<br> See you later, Lachie.<br> We'll see you outside, Lachie.<br> - Yank?<br> - Aye?<br> Now that the war's over,<br> what are you going to do?<br> You've got no place to go but America.<br> - Well, it isn't that bad.<br> - Well, I've been thinking.<br> You could stay at my wee house<br> in Scotland for a while.<br> For as long as you like.<br> Well, that's mighty nice of you,<br> buster, but...<br> You're going to turn me down,<br> like the others.<br> It isn't a case of turning you down.<br> We've all got places<br> we've been dreaming about<br> and wanting to see again.<br> Just like you and your wee house<br> in Scotland.<br> For me it's a little place<br> on the Rock River, Dixon, Illinois.<br> But once you get back there<br> I'll not hear of you again.<br> Well, of course you will.<br> Just because we're a few miles apart<br> doesn't mean<br> we're gonna forget each other.<br> I'll be writing to you.<br> - You'll write me a letter?<br> - Certainly, we all will.<br> A letter in my own name?<br> Lachlan MacLachlan,<br> - Esquire?<br> - Esquire.<br> Oh, that'll be fine.<br> Here, Lachie, drink this.<br> Yank, the Colonel wants to see you.<br> - Okay.<br> - Yank, I'll write you, too.<br> I'll send you a photo of my house<br> in Scotland.<br> Send me a picture of you in that kilt.<br> Looks like the only way<br> I'll ever get to see it.<br> I guess he'll be leaving us<br> in a couple of days.<br> So soon?<br> He's going for his final examination.<br> Oh, I'll miss him sore.<br> We all will.<br> I even find myself wishing<br> he was not well enough to leave.<br> - That's selfish, I suppose.<br> - No, not exactly.<br> We all hate to see good friends leave.<br> You know, Sister,<br> Yank's gonna write to me.<br> - Is he?<br> - Aye.<br> He says they'll all write to me.<br> I'll be getting letters<br> from all over the world.<br> - That should make you very proud.<br> - Aye.<br> No matter where I go in my life<br> I'll not be alone.<br> I'll have friends.<br> Good friends.<br> Rest, Lachie.<br> Don't talk so much.<br> Where's Lachie?<br> Inside. He's having a nap.<br> - What did Old Cobwebs say?<br> - Yeah, when are you going?<br> - Well, as a matter of fact, I...<br> - Yank?<br> Yeah?<br> The Colonel just called.<br> What's this about you<br> not wanting to go home?<br> - Eh?<br> - What's that?<br> What do you mean?<br> Of course I wanna go home.<br> - I haven't been feeling well lately.<br> - You haven't?<br> What's wrong?<br> I don't know.<br> My hands have been shaking a little,<br> - and I get a lot of headaches.<br> - You're a liar, but a nice liar.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> This'll make it much easier for Lachie,<br> but what about you?<br> - You must be barmy.<br> - Don't be a fool, Yank. Go on home.<br> There's nothing more<br> we can do for Lachie.<br> Look, I...<br> Corporal MacLachlan.<br> Present and ready for your inspection, sir.<br> Oh, Lachie, it's beautiful.<br> That's jolly!<br> Come on down.<br> We'll all have a look at you.<br> I put it on for you, Yank.<br> I knew you'd want to see it before you left.<br> Do you like it?<br> Now I know why<br> those Scot troops are so proud.<br> I thought, since you were going away...<br> Yeah, well, to tell you the truth, Lachie,<br> I'm not leaving just yet.<br> - You're not? Sister, I thought you said...<br> - Well.<br> Old Cobwebs changed his mind<br> this morning.<br> - There's something wrong with my head.<br> - Oh? Nothing serious?<br> Oh, no, just an occasional hole<br> here and there.<br> - That's all.<br> - Oh, that's fine.<br> Oh, I mean, I'm sorry you're not<br> going home, but I'm glad you're staying.<br> - Now, I can take this off.<br> - Oh, wait a minute, buster,<br> we want a picture of you in that outfit.<br> Get your camera, Sister.<br> I've never had my photo took in my life!<br> Oh, no. I refuse! I absolutely refuse.<br> All right now, be very still.<br> Ready?<br> Smile.<br> Lachie, could you smile a little more?<br> I cannot make an expression at will.<br> Well, if you can't smile a little more,<br> see if you can frown a little less.<br> Go on, do what Sister tells you.<br> Now, ready,<br> one, two, three.<br> There. I think that'll be a good one.<br> Now, let's take one of Lachie by himself.<br> Oh, no!<br> I refuse.<br> - I absolutely refuse.<br> - Why?<br> - Well, I can not face that alone.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> It won't hurt a bit. Stand right here<br> and we'll tell you what to do.<br> All right, I'm being harried into it,<br> but let's go on with it.<br> Come on, Blossom.<br> Now, Lachie, just pretend you're standing<br> on your own land,<br> - Iooking down the road.<br> - Up to your kilt in heather.<br> Lachie, can't you stand some other way<br> except with your arms crossed?<br> Well, I...<br> There, that's nice. Now, ready.<br> Still.<br> Lachie, don't move about so much.<br> Well, I do not ken<br> what to do with my hands.<br> - Stand on them.<br> - Put them in your pockets.<br> Just stand up straight and look happy.<br> Yeah, face this way<br> and keep your head up.<br> And don't look so uncomfortable.<br> All right now.<br> Lachie, shade your eyes with one hand.<br> You're looking down the road<br> for your sheep.<br> Facing this way.<br> Tommy, get out of the picture!<br> Yes, Sister.<br> Ready, smile.<br> - Lachie, smile.<br> - I cannot smile.<br> You'd better grab it while you can.<br> He's getting mad.<br> All right, one, two, three.<br> - That's it.<br> - That's a good boy, lad. Nice work.<br> Say, a mad Scot in a kilt<br> is really something terrific.<br> I thought you were my friends.<br> Thank you, Lachie, you were very patient<br> and handsome.<br> - Yank, would you get those developed.<br> - Okay.<br> Now, some of you boys go over to<br> the main block and pick up the bathtub.<br> They've promised to loan it to us<br> for a couple of days.<br> Okay. We'll do that.<br> Now, if you'll pardon me,<br> I'll put my kilt away.<br> Oh, what's the hurry, Lachie?<br> We haven't had time to see it properly.<br> Yeah, we haven't been able to examine it.<br> - Well, you have my photo to study.<br> - That won't tell us what we want to know.<br> - I mean, it's such a beautiful kilt.<br> - Yeah, it's such a lovely color.<br> We want to see it swing.<br> Lachie, how about walking about a bit?<br> - That's a good idea!<br> - Yeah, go on, boy.<br> - All right, if you wish it.<br> - That's a good boy. Come on, then.<br> There we are.<br> - Well, that's smashing, Lachie.<br> - Very nice.<br> - Very nice indeed.<br> - Smashing, eh?<br> Well, tell me, Lachie.<br> What happens if you have to make<br> a little turn?<br> Well, there's a wee flare.<br> - A wee flare? Hey, what's that like?<br> - I think we ought to see that, Lachie.<br> Very interesting.<br> Tell me, Lachie, what happens<br> if you had to do a very quick turn?<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing?<br> I should have thought<br> it had been as graceful as a fountain.<br> - A beautiful sight.<br> - Oh, lovely, lovely.<br> So I don't think we should miss it, Lachie.<br> Tommy!<br> Are you boys going to get that tub, or not?<br> Okay, Sister.<br> Go ahead.<br> You fellows can manage without me.<br> Don't go away, Lachie.<br> Yank, could you wait?<br> There's something I'd like to ask you.<br> - Well, sure, Lachie.<br> - Take a seat.<br> - What's on your mind?<br> - Have you ever been in love?<br> With bells on.<br> - Well, when was the first time you knew?<br> - Oh, I'd say the first time I kissed her.<br> Hey, you're not asking me to tell you<br> about the bees and the flowers, are you?<br> There are certain things that are as<br> well-known in Scotland as anywhere else.<br> Well, I'm glad to hear it.<br> I'd hate to see the Scots die out.<br> Well, about this kissing,<br> when a good girl kisses you,<br> it's an encouraging sign, is it not?<br> Well, good or bad, it's encouraging<br> any way you look at it.<br> Aye.<br> Tell me, you think I have the right<br> to ask a lass to be my wife?<br> - Well, look, buster, you don't mean...<br> - Aye.<br> - Bonny Sister Parker.<br> - Wait a minute, Lachie.<br> Everybody falls in love with his nurse.<br> It's natural.<br> Well, I bet every patient in that ward has<br> been in love with the Sister for a while,<br> - including me.<br> - I do not resent it. She's a bonny girl.<br> Well, yes, but just because<br> the Sister takes care of us<br> and is good to us,<br> doesn't mean she's in love with us.<br> You might be making a mistake.<br> Have you ever heard<br> of the Sister kissing a patient?<br> - No.<br> - Of course not.<br> So if she did kiss a man<br> of her own free will<br> it would mean that<br> she meant to encourage him.<br> - Eh?<br> - Well...<br> And if she kissed me, and she did,<br> it must mean something.<br> Lachie,<br> I don't know.<br> Well, the one sure way of finding out<br> is to ask her, and I will.<br> I have my proposal all prepared.<br> Wish me luck.<br> Oh, wait right there.<br> I'll not be long, whatever happens.<br> Come in.<br> Have you a minute to spare, Sister?<br> Well, I was just going to take these over<br> to the matron.<br> Oh, that can wait.<br> I was thinking of making<br> a proposal of marriage.<br> - Good gracious, you don't mean me?<br> - Well, who else?<br> I think you'd best be seated.<br> I told you once,<br> I had no plans for marriage in my future,<br> - you may recall.<br> - Vividly.<br> - But, Lachie, you mustn't feel that you...<br> - Please do not interrupt.<br> My proposal.<br> I'm not much of a man on the surface,<br> but I have a great and powerful<br> will to work.<br> I have a wee house in Scotland<br> that you know about.<br> My health is good.<br> I've a fearful temper, but I do not think<br> I'll ever make you suffer for it.<br> I'll do my best. I'll give you all I can.<br> You'll never want for food.<br> And you'll never have<br> to worry about the rent.<br> I've worked since I was seven.<br> I've been a cabin boy,<br> a seaman, a carpenter, a farmer,<br> a miner and a stevedore.<br> I can give you<br> numerous character references.<br> I've good teeth.<br> I'm not tattooed or anything.<br> I love you.<br> I hope you'll do me the honor<br> of considering my proposal.<br> Lachie,<br> are you asking me to marry you,<br> because you think<br> you owe me something?<br> I offer you my heart<br> because it does me no good without you.<br> I wish I knew what to do.<br> I mean, what to say to you.<br> You do not share my feelings?<br> I've made you unhappy.<br> I presumed too much.<br> No. No, it's not like that at all.<br> I'm making you unhappy.<br> And only because<br> I haven't the courage to...<br> Lachie,<br> you want us to be married?<br> Is that what you want most in your life?<br> Aye, my darling. You'll marry me, girl?<br> If it makes you happy to think of us<br> being married,<br> then that's what I want, too.<br> Oh, oh, my bonny, bonny lass.<br> Oh, I'll do nothing to displease!<br> - Lachie.<br> - Oh, I promise. I promise.<br> Lachie, there's so many things<br> I want to say to you.<br> - But they can wait.<br> - Aye.<br> Yank, Yank! She will, lad! She will!<br> She'll marry you?<br> Aye, we've not set the date,<br> but she agreed.<br> Well, that's great, Lachie. Congratulations.<br> Will you stand up for me?<br> - Be your best man?<br> - Aye.<br> Yeah, I guess I can do that all right.<br> Thanks, lad. Thanks!<br> Come on, Blossom.<br> I'll teach you another word.<br> One suitable for all occasions.<br> - How much further is it?<br> - Only another hundred miles.<br> When I get this thing inside I'm gonna sit<br> in it and do my laundry.<br> - You sit in that, you'll wear it for life.<br> - That must be the tub they boil the tea in.<br> Getting heavy?<br> Getting no lighter<br> with all the help I'm getting.<br> Well, it's uphill, that's why.<br> Well, use your periscope if you can't see.<br> Where are we going from here?<br> - A little bit more.<br> - Nearly there.<br> All right. Put it down.<br> - Yeah, we'll take it from here.<br> - Thank you, big-hearted Arthur.<br> - Now rest yourself.<br> - Thanks, mate.<br> Oh, I'll tell you.<br> - You're out of condition, you know.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey, Yank, where's Lachie?<br> - In the washroom taking off his kilt.<br> - Oh.<br> What's going on here?<br> - A kilt, sir. We was having a bet, sir.<br> - A Scotch bet, sir.<br> Just a little joke, sir.<br> - Where is the Sister?<br> - Stepped out, sir.<br> - And Corporal MacLachlan?<br> - In the washroom, sir.<br> Well, ask him to come out, will you?<br> I want to talk to him.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Lachie, Colonel wants to see you.<br> - I was just changing, sir.<br> - That's all right.<br> - Oh, did you take the pills I sent over?<br> - Aye.<br> But you cannot force me<br> to take any more, sir.<br> What's that?<br> May I be so bold as to remind you, sir,<br> that as a British soldier<br> I have the right to refuse them.<br> Now, look.<br> You fellows wait outside, will you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Sit down.<br> Well, Corporal, I've had a call about you<br> from my Brigadier at headquarters.<br> He's instructed me to tell you that<br> you can go home to Scotland immediately,<br> if you want to go.<br> Is there not a waiting list, sir?<br> Well, he evidently thinks you're more<br> important than the waiting list.<br> Well, he must be joking, sir.<br> I'm only a Corporal.<br> - Of course, from the Camerons.<br> - Well, whatever your rank,<br> there's a passage<br> booked for you tomorrow.<br> They've given you<br> a very high priority by plane.<br> You can be home in Scotland<br> in a few days.<br> But why am I so important, sir?<br> What's the reason?<br> Because yours happens to be<br> a very special case.<br> Well, what's so special about it?<br> The point is, Corporal,<br> would you like to go?<br> Before I answer that, sir,<br> I think I have the right to know<br> why I'm being given this privilege.<br> There's more to this than meets the eye.<br> Well, since you really want to know,<br> I've been ordered to give you<br> all the facts of the case.<br> - But I've been given the facts.<br> - No. No, not entirely.<br> When you came in here<br> with a bit of shrapnel in your kidney<br> there was a chance<br> that you would recover.<br> I have.<br> You've recovered from the operation, yes.<br> But you only have one kidney left.<br> It's a bad one. I know you feel quite well,<br> but that one kidney<br> is destined to collapse.<br> Then what happens?<br> We can't give a man a new kidney.<br> Understand?<br> Aye.<br> It's very clear.<br> How long have I got, sir?<br> Not very long, I'm afraid.<br> A week, maybe two.<br> I've not very much time, have I?<br> I didn't tell you before, MacLachlan,<br> because to me<br> there seemed nothing to gain.<br> But perhaps it's just as well<br> that you do know.<br> I misjudged you, sir. I'm sorry for it.<br> - I thought you had a spite on me.<br> - Hardly.<br> I only wished there was something I...<br> Lad, would you like<br> to go back to Scotland?<br> Or would you rather stay here<br> with your friends?<br> Did the men in the ward<br> know about me, sir?<br> Well, I wanted to make things as pleasant<br> as possible for you,<br> - so I asked them to help you.<br> - And the Sister?<br> Naturally, she had to know.<br> I'd like to go back to Scotland, sir.<br> - Well, if that's your wish.<br> - That's my wish!<br> MacLachlan,<br> I'd like to be able to say something<br> warm and wise and comforting.<br> You can spare me that.<br> I've had enough pity, thank you.<br> If I can help you, let me know.<br> I'll take care of your papers<br> and arrange your transport.<br> We'll get you down to Calcutta<br> in the morning.<br> Hey, Lachie, what'd he say to you?<br> Did he tick you off<br> about those pills, Lachie?<br> I bet our Lachie stood up to him.<br> Yeah, did you tell him where to get off?<br> Well, never mind, Old Cobwebs<br> just likes to throw his weight around.<br> I think I'll get that roll of films<br> developed before dinner.<br> Hey, what are you doing?<br> You're ruining them!<br> You swine. You dirty swine.<br> Where's Lachie?<br> Well, he's in the washroom.<br> Hey, what's wrong with him?<br> - He lost his temper with us...<br> - He threw out our film.<br> - He called us dirty swine.<br> - The Colonel told him everything.<br> What?<br> - I'll return these to you.<br> - Lachie.<br> I'll be going away in the morning.<br> If you have any decency in you,<br> will you kindly not speak to me again?<br> I have no wish to see you, any of you!<br> - Now, wait a minute.<br> - I'll break your face if you come near me.<br> You'll need us, Lachie. You'll need us.<br> I'll need no one.<br> I'll die as I've lived,<br> alone and with some dignity.<br> I should've known<br> you'd be like all the rest!<br> Well, you've bought my friendship cheaply.<br> For the price of a kilt.<br> I should've put a higher value on my pride.<br> How righteous you must've felt<br> in your pity and your goodness.<br> Well, I'll not let you hurt me again.<br> Are you the driver<br> for Corporal MacLachlan?<br> - That's right, Sister.<br> - He won't be ready for a little while yet.<br> - Oh, could I get myself a cup of tea?<br> - Of course.<br> Any more tea, Yank?<br> Here are your papers, Yank,<br> they're all signed.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You'll be leaving this afternoon.<br> When's he going?<br> In a little while.<br> Could I talk to you?<br> Later.<br> - Finished?<br> - Yeah.<br> I could make better tea with feathers.<br> - How about you?<br> - Yeah.<br> I suppose this'll be my job,<br> now you're going.<br> You can have it.<br> You let your breakfast get cold.<br> Don't you want it?<br> Sister said you'd be leaving<br> in a little while.<br> If you stayed, Lachie, I would.<br> Well, I'm sorry to see you go.<br> I'd like to say goodbye.<br> You've said it.<br> Here are your papers, Lachie.<br> Your transport's outside.<br> I'll be ready in a moment.<br> Lachie.<br> - How about some help with these dishes?<br> - Yeah, of course.<br> - How about some help?<br> - I'm coming.<br> - How about some help, Digger?<br> - Okay.<br> Come on, Blossom.<br> May I stay and talk with you?<br> I have nothing to say.<br> Oh, Lachie dear, please listen.<br> I may not have another chance.<br> We wanted to save you<br> all the unhappiness we could.<br> - Was that so terrible?<br> - Did you forget I was a soldier?<br> Didn't you know I'd faced dying before?<br> You didn't have to go out of your way<br> to make it easy for me.<br> Do you think the way<br> we feel about you now is less genuine,<br> less honest<br> because we knew to begin with?<br> Dare you answer that truthfully?<br> Well, of course we were more considerate<br> because we knew.<br> What kind of people would we be<br> if we'd been indifferent?<br> The kind of people<br> I should've known you'd be!<br> You're easy to find the world over,<br> the kind that would beat a man, rob him,<br> hound him, slander him and betray him,<br> and think it fair game unless he was dying.<br> We're your friends, Lachie.<br> No matter how you acquired us.<br> We're the only friends you have<br> in the world, remember that.<br> Don't value us lightly.<br> For a time you made me think<br> I'd been wrong.<br> You gave me a fool's religion to die on.<br> If you only knew the bitterness<br> I must thank you for.<br> Do you think the only reason we were<br> kind to you was because we knew?<br> Oh, what other reason was there?<br> Was it easy to like me?<br> - No, it wasn't.<br> - Did I go out of my way to be<br> - pleasant to you?<br> - No.<br> Did I ask you or invite you,<br> or even encourage you<br> - to worm your way into my heart?<br> - No, you didn't.<br> Well, then, should I be proud that you<br> liked me only because I was to die?<br> If that were the only reason, no.<br> Lachie.<br> Lachie, please listen to me.<br> Forget everything but this.<br> For a little while you learned<br> the meaning of friendship.<br> Didn't you say<br> you'd shared a moment with kings?<br> If I must die to learn to love<br> my fellow man, I'll do without him.<br> It's too high a price to pay.<br> Darling, what difference does it make<br> why people are good?<br> Do you think I said I'd marry you<br> only because I pitied you?<br> - Well, didn't you pity me?<br> - With all my heart.<br> Surely there's pity in every woman's love.<br> I'm done with my packing.<br> Would you hate it if I kissed you goodbye?<br> You did ask me to be your wife, you know.<br> I've no words for you.<br> Lachie.<br> Yank.<br> Could you help him out with his things?<br> Yeah.<br> - I'll take these.<br> - I need no help.<br> Hand me the camera, will you?<br> I thought I'd put some new film in here<br> and get some new pictures of all you guys<br> before I go.<br> You can count me out,<br> I don't feel like pictures.<br> Me neither.<br> Blossom.<br> Baksheesh.<br> Baksheesh.<br> Oh, leave me be!<br> I want to tell you something, buster,<br> before you go.<br> There's a mean streak in you<br> that only a bullet can cure.<br> You've been sore your whole life<br> because things didn't come easy for you.<br> And you've taken your spite out<br> on every person you ever met.<br> You don't want our friendship?<br> Well, you didn't pay for it,<br> you didn't earn it, you got it for nothing,<br> so what are you kicking about?<br> And now the payoff,<br> you're sore because you didn't know<br> when you were going to die.<br> Does anybody know<br> when he's going to die?<br> No. But you had to know.<br> You're the kind of a hero<br> who wants to bet on a sure thing.<br> Why, you don't know what courage is.<br> You've been afraid to live<br> since the day you were born!<br> I'm not afraid of dying. Do not think it.<br> But you've tricked and cheated me.<br> You did not give me friendship,<br> you gave me pity.<br> Sure, at first we did.<br> What else could we give you?<br> I'm not gonna stand here and try<br> to convince you that we were your friends.<br> You're determined not to believe that.<br> But you're wrong, and I can prove it.<br> Did Blossom pity you?<br> Or was he a friend like we tried to be?<br> Blossom.<br> See? No English.<br> He didn't know you were going to die.<br> He still doesn't know.<br> He doesn't even know<br> what we're talking about.<br> He didn't make that necklace for you<br> out of pity.<br> He wanted to give you something<br> because he liked you.<br> Now, go ahead, Lachie,<br> fling it in his face again.<br> Throw his friendship back at him,<br> the same as you did with us.<br> Blossom.<br> Your driver's waiting. Are you ready to go?<br> Are you ready, Lachie?<br> Aye.<br> - Would you help him with his kit?<br> - He doesn't want any help.<br> Yank, please.<br> He doesn't have to leave,<br> he knows he's wrong,<br> but he's just too stubborn to admit it.<br> Let him go.<br> I wish I could understand what makes<br> a man wanna die despised and friendless.<br> Digger?<br> Sure.<br> - Where's your bag, Lachie?<br> - I need no help.<br> Goodbye, Lachie.<br> Well, now that he's out of the way<br> we can take some pictures.<br> Come on, you guys, how about it?<br> Let's have some fun.<br> Digger, Kiwi, Tommy,<br> get in right over here.<br> You too, Blossom.<br> Here, Sister, you take the pictures.<br> Come on, line up,<br> here's a good place right here.<br> Get down on the bed.<br> Okay, right here, Blossom.<br> Now, let's smile everybody.<br> Come on, a great big, broad smile.<br> I'd be willing to consider remaining<br> if you admit you wronged me.<br> If you think we're gonna beg you to stay,<br> you're wasting your time.<br> We're ready, Sister.<br> - I'll not give you another chance.<br> - I told you, you're wasting your time.<br> Come on, take the picture, Sister.<br> I do not want to die alone.<br> Lachie, why don't you say everything<br> you want to say?<br> It's not easy for me to say it.<br> All my life<br> I've hated what I could not have,<br> and saved my pride.<br> But, now, I've not the time<br> to squander on my pride.<br> So I ask you humbly.<br> I want to stay.<br> If I must beg you to take me back,<br> then I beg you.<br> Why don't you get washed up, buster?<br> You'll feel better.<br> Aye.<br> Well, you made him stay, Yank.<br> Yeah, I feel as if someone<br> should kick my teeth in.<br> Here.<br> You think it'd make him feel better<br> if we let him play his bagpipes?<br> Don't be silly,<br> he hasn't any wind left in him.<br> True enough.<br> Oh, Sister, he looked a bit pale.<br> Maybe you'd better go in and see him.<br> No, I think not.<br> He just swallowed his pride,<br> it'll take him a moment or two to digest it.<br> Come on, let's finish<br> taking these pictures, shall we?<br> Yeah, we might as well get that over with.<br> Come on, Blossom,<br> have your picture taken.<br> Oh, I'm gonna sit down for a change.<br> - Tommy?<br> - Coming now, Sister.<br> Now, stand close together.<br> Oh, this is lovely.<br> One, two, three.<br> Would you be so good as to let me<br> have my photo taken with you?<br> Please?<br> You belong here, buster.<br> - Ready?<br> - Oh, excuse me.<br> Now, hold still.<br> Do we look very handsome, Sister?<br> No, not very handsome.<br> But very, very wonderful.<br> One, two, three.<br> That's it.<br> Hey! Now, don't you do that!<br> I found out! I looked, I found out!<br> Hey, Sister, it's not fair!<br> Tommy.<br> English<br>
