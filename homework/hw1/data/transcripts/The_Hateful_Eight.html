Marquis had a bright idea.<br> So bright...<br> you got to wonder,<br> why nobody never thought about it before.<br> Tell John Ruth about your bright idea.<br> Well the whole damn place<br> was just made out of kindling.<br> So I burnt it down.<br> There was a rookie regiment<br> spendin' the overnight in that camp.<br> Forty-seven men...<br> burnt to a crisp.<br> Southern youth, farmer's sons,<br> - cream of the crop-<br> - And I say, "Let 'em burn".<br> I'm suppose to apologize<br> for killin' Johnny Reb?<br> You joined the war to<br> keep niggers in chains.<br> I joined the war to<br> kill White Southern<br> Crackers And that means<br> kill 'em anyway I can.<br> Shoot 'em. Stab 'em.<br> Drown 'em. Burn 'em.<br> Drop a big ole' rock on their head.<br> Whatever it took to put<br> White Southern Crackers in the ground<br> that's what I joined the war to do,<br> and that's what I did.<br> To answer your question, John Ruth,<br> when Major Marquis<br> burned forty seven men alive,<br> for no more a reason then to give<br> a nigger a run for the trees,<br> that's when The South put a reward<br> on the head of Major Marquis.<br> And I made them trees, Mannix.<br> And you best belive I ain't look back<br> till I crossed The Northern Line.<br> But you had a surprise waitin' for you<br> on The Northern Side, didn't ya'?<br> See once they started pullin' out<br> all the burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,<br> seems not all of them boys were Rebs.<br> You burnt up some of your own boys,<br> didn't ya' Major?<br> How many burnt prisoners<br> they end up findin'?<br> Wasn't the final Yankee death count<br> somethin' like thirty-seven?<br> That's the thing about war Mannix,<br> people die.<br> So ya' chalkin' it up to "War Is Hell", ha?<br> Well admittedly that's a hard argument<br> to argue with. But if memory serves,<br> your side didn't look at it that way.<br> I think they thought,<br> thirty-seven white men for one nigger<br> wasn't so hot a trade.<br> I belive they accused you<br> of being a kill crazy nigger who<br> only joined the war to kill white folks<br> and the whole Blue and Grey<br> of it all didn't really much matter to ya'.<br> And that's why they drummed<br> your black ass outta'<br> the Cavalry with a yellow<br> stripe down your back.<br> Isn't it Major?<br> Horse shit.<br> If he did all that, the<br> Cavalry woulda' shot him.<br> I didn't say they could prove it.<br> But they sure did think it out loud,<br> didn't they Major?<br> But,<br> Warren's war record was stellar,<br> and that's what saved his ass.<br> Are you killed<br> yourself your share of<br> redskins in your day,<br> didn't ya' Black Major?<br> Cavalry tends to<br> look kindly on that.<br> I'll tell a' what The Cavalry<br> didn't look kindly on.<br> Mannix's Marauders that's what.<br> And the fact that Erskine<br> Mannix's little boy<br> would talk about anybody<br> else's behavior<br> during war time makes<br> me wanna horse laugh.<br> Don't you say anything about my daddy,<br> what he fought for,<br> was dignity in defeat,<br> and against the unconditional surrender.<br> We weren't foreign barbatians<br> pounding on the city walls.<br> We were your brothers.<br> - We deserved dignity in defeat.<br> - Just,<br> how many nigger towns did y'all sack<br> in your fight for dignity in defeat?<br> My faire share, Black Major.<br> 'Cuz when niggers are scared,<br> that's when white folks are safe.<br> You gonna talk<br> that hateful nigger talk,<br> you ride up top wtih O.B.<br> No no no,<br> you got me talkin' politics<br> I didn't wanna'.<br> Like I said y'all,<br> I'm just happy to be alive.<br> I...<br> I think I'll just look out this winda'<br> let this beatuiful<br> carriage rock me to sleep.<br> And dream about how lucky I am.<br> Chapter Three<br> Minnie's Haberdashery<br> Get in there.<br> Easy.<br> What the hell's going on,<br> we weren't expecting another stage tonight?<br> I can see<br> you already got another one up in here.<br> I just got through putting the horses away.<br> This ain't the normal line. But we are<br> stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,<br> so it looks like you're stuck with us.<br> Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?<br> They ain't here.<br> I'm running the place while they're gone.<br> Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?<br> He says they ain't here. He's lookin'<br> after the place while they gone.<br> Who are you?<br> I'm Bob.<br> Well whoever you are,<br> help O.B. with the horses.<br> Get 'em outta this cold,<br> before that blizzard hit's 'em.<br> I just put those other horses away.<br> You need it done fast, you need to help.<br> I got two of my best men on it.<br> You heard him freeloaders,<br> get to work.<br> Come on let's go!<br> - Open up!<br> - Kick it open!<br> - What?<br> - Kick it open!<br> Shut that door,<br> there's a goddamn blizzard out there!<br> - You gotta' nail it shut!<br> - You have to nail it shut!<br> - Hold it shut!<br> - There's a hammer and nails by the door!<br> You have to nail it shut!<br> There's a hammer and nails by the door!<br> - Give me a hammer.<br> - Yeah.<br> You need to do two pieces of wood!<br> One ain't good enough!<br> - Two pieces of wood.<br> - That fuckin' thing is busted!<br> Not just one piece of wood.<br> - Gimme that other piece of wood.<br> - Yeah, allright.<br> - Gimme the nail.<br> - Here.<br> Jesus.<br> That door's a son of a gun.<br> Who's the idiot who broke that,<br> that Mexican fella'?<br> Good heavens,<br> a woman<br> out in this white hell.<br> You must be frozen solid, poor thing.<br> Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.<br> When did you fella's arrive?<br> About forty minutes ago.<br> The Cowboy fella' in the<br> courner, is that your driver?<br> No he's a passenger.<br> The driver lit out. He<br> said he was going to<br> spend the blizzard shacked<br> up with a friend.<br> Jesus Christ, that's awful!<br> Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella'<br> do, soak his ole socks in the pot?<br> I think we all felt the same way, but were<br> a little too polite to say something.<br> - He don't have that problem.<br> . Where's the well water?<br> Over there.<br> So,<br> all three of you fellas' headed to Red<br> Rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh?<br> Yes, all three of us<br> were on that stagecouch out there.<br> Coffybeans?<br> Over there.<br> Get your hand outta' there.<br> The new sheriff of Red<br> Rock is traveling with us.<br> Sheriff of Red Rock,<br> that'll be the day.<br> If he is a goddamn sheriff,<br> I'm a monkey's uncle.<br> Good.<br> Then you can share bananas<br> with your nigger friend in the stable.<br> So...<br> the new sheriff of Red<br> Rock is traveling with you?<br> No he's lyin'<br> he ain't sheriff of nothin'<br> He's a southern renegade. He's just talkin'<br> his self outta' freezin' to death, is all.<br> What the fuck I tell you<br> about talkin', huh?<br> I'll bust you in the mouth right in<br> front of these people, I don't give a fuck!<br> You never gave your name, sir.<br> John Ruth.<br> - Are you a lawman?<br> - I'm takin' her to the law.<br> - You're a bounty hunter?<br> - That's right, Buster.<br> - Do you have a warrant?<br> - 'Course I do.<br> May I see it?<br> Why?<br> You're suppose to produce it upon request.<br> How am I suppose to know,<br> you're not a villain,<br> kidnapping this woman<br> without a warrant in your possession?<br> What's your name, Buster?<br> Well...<br> it certainly isn't Buster.<br> It's Oswaldo Mobray.<br> - Oswaldo?<br> - Yes.<br> Well...<br> I got my warrant, Oswaldo.<br> - I take it you're Daisy Domergue?<br> - Yeah it's her.<br> - It says here, Dead or Alive?<br> - Yeah it does.<br> Transporting a desperate<br> hostile prisoner such as her<br> sounds like hard work.<br> Wouldn't transporting her be easier<br> if she were dead?<br> No one said the job<br> was suppose to be easy.<br> And why is her hanging proper,<br> so important to you?<br> Let's just say I don't like to cheat the<br> hangman. He's gotta' make a living too.<br> Well I appreciate that.<br> Allow me to properly introduce myself.<br> I'm Oswaldo Mobray,<br> The Hangman in these parts.<br> - Looks like I brought you a customer.<br> - So it would appear.<br> Have you ever spent two days or more<br> locked up with one of your customers?<br> No I can't say I have.<br> Don't talk to my prisoner. I talk to<br> my prisoner, that's it. You got it?<br> I got I got. Jolly good.<br> You got anything in here besides<br> coffee that can help warm us up?<br> The Bar is open, follow moi.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> Come on, goddamnit I'm cold!<br> I'll feed and water the horses.<br> You go inside and get some hot coffy.<br> I've got some stew cooking.<br> Should be done soon.<br> Now look...<br> now matter how bad this blizzard gets,<br> we still gotta' feed these horses<br> and take a squat from time to time.<br> So me an' Chris better lay out a line<br> from the stable to the front door,<br> and from the front door to the shithouse.<br> Okay?<br> Good idea.<br> Come on, Chris.<br> I'll give you a hand.<br> No no no, go inside, get warm.<br> You're doing stable work in a goddamn<br> blizzard, I offer to help and you say no?<br> You're right, mi amigo.<br> Muchas gracias.<br> All right, follow me.<br> We gonna' drop one,<br> every ten paces.<br> - From here to the door.<br> - Yeah! - All right.<br> Now, you're wanted for murder.<br> For the sake of my analogy,<br> let's just assume that you did it.<br> John Ruth wants to take you back to<br> Red Rock to stand trail for murder.<br> And, if...<br> you're found guilty,<br> the people of Red Rock will hang you in the<br> town square. And as the hangman,<br> I will perform the execution.<br> And if all those things<br> end up taking place,<br> that's what civilized<br> society calls "justice".<br> However,<br> if the relatives and the<br> loved ones of the person<br> you murdered were outside<br> that door right now.<br> And after busting down that<br> door, they drug you out<br> in the snow and hung you<br> up by the neck, that,<br> we would be frontier justice.<br> Now the good part<br> about frontier justice is<br> it's very thirst quenching.<br> The bad part is<br> it's apt to be Wrong as Right.<br> Not in your case. In<br> your case, you'd have it<br> comin'. But other people,<br> maybe not so much.<br> But ultimately what's the<br> real difference between the two?<br> The real difference is Me...<br> The Hangman.<br> To me, it dosen't matter what you did.<br> When I hang you, I<br> will get no satisfaction from your death.<br> It's my job.<br> I hang you in red Rock, I move on to the<br> next town, I hang someone else there.<br> The man who pulls the lever,<br> that breaks your neck<br> will be a dispassionate man.<br> And that dispassion is<br> the very essence of<br> justice. For justice delivered<br> without dispassion,<br> is always in danger of not being justice.<br> Amen.<br> No offense cowboy fella',<br> just gettin' your attention.<br> Yeah, well...<br> you got it.<br> What'cha writing firend?<br> - Only thing I'm qualified to write about.<br> - What's that?<br> My life story.<br> - You're writing your life story?<br> - You bet I am.<br> Am I in it?<br> You just entered.<br> Well you like writing<br> stories so much, why don't<br> you tell me the story<br> that brings you here?<br> - Who's askin'?<br> - I am.<br> John Ruth. I'm bringin' in<br> this one to Red Rock to hang.<br> Ain't no way I'm spendin'<br> a coupla' nights under a<br> roof with somebody I don't<br> know who you they are.<br> And I don't know who you are.<br> So...<br> who are you?<br> - Joe Gage.<br> - What?<br> That's my name, Joe Gage.<br> Okay Joe Gage, why you goin' to Red Rock?<br> - I ain't goin' to Red Rock.<br> - Where you goin'?<br> - About nine miles outside of Red Rock.<br> - What's there?<br> My mother.<br> Your mother?<br> Listen,<br> I'm just a cow puncher I just...<br> I got back from a long drive and...<br> I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time,<br> I was a partner.<br> For the first time in my life I,<br> made a pretty penny and, eh....<br> Come home and spend time with<br> my mother for Christmas.<br> Now that's funny.<br> 'Cuz you don't look like the<br> coming home for Christmas type.<br> Yeah, well...<br> you know, looks<br> can be deceiving.<br> Because I definitely am a...<br> coming home for Christmas to<br> spend time with mother type.<br> Christmas with Mother?<br> I mean...<br> it's a wonderful thing.<br> Now is that... good<br> enough for you?<br> John Ruth?<br> For now.<br> Just steer clear of my prisoner.<br> Hello old timer.<br> General.<br> General.<br> You sir,<br> are a Hyena.<br> And I have no wish to speak to you.<br> I've been called worse.<br> Fair enough, General.<br> Sorry to bother you.<br> - You gonna' kick it open.<br> - Kick it open.<br> It's already cold enough in here.<br> It dosen't have latch you<br> gonna' hammer up a board.<br> You gotta' nail it shut!<br> - The hammer and nails is by the door.<br> - There is a hammer and nails right there!<br> Oh god,<br> - Holdin' this Chris.<br> - Here, here.<br> You need to nail it in!<br> You need two pieces of wood.<br> You gotta' hammer another one.<br> One ain't good enough!<br> It's gonna' blow right open.<br> - Goddamn it!<br> - It's gotta' open if you don't.<br> - Shut up!<br> - I got it! Son of a bitch!<br> Jesis Christ,<br> that door's a whore!<br> I get it, haberdashery,<br> that was a joke.<br> How's the coffy?<br> Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself.<br> Thank you.<br> Guess who he is?<br> Buffalo Bill?<br> Hardly, no.<br> - I'm Oswaldo Mobray, I'm The-<br> - He's the hangman of Red Rock.<br> - Oh, you are?<br> - Yes I am.<br> Well good to meet you Mr.?<br> - Mobray.<br> - Mobray, I'm Chris Mannix,<br> - the new sheriff in Red Rock.<br> - Really?<br> Horseshit!<br> - Pay no attention to him.<br> - Horseshit!<br> Fella' warmin' himself by the that pot<br> by the stove is a hell of driver named O.B.<br> That's the only thing you<br> said that's the truth.<br> You comin' into Red Rock<br> to hang Lance Lawson?<br> Precisely.<br> - Do you have the execution orders on you?<br> - In my beg.<br> - May I see 'em?<br> - Of course.<br> Who's Lance Lawson?<br> He's a fell' been sittin' in the<br> Red Rock jail about a month now.<br> He's the fella - who shot the fella' -<br> who was sheriff 'fore me.<br> Precisely.<br> What did she mean when she said,<br> bounty hunter's nigger<br> friend in the stable?<br> He's got a nigger<br> bounty hunter firend in the stable.<br> But all that<br> just to guard her?<br> I don't think that was<br> the original idea, but...<br> that's the idea now.<br> - Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy?<br> - Yeah.<br> Five of you?<br> Well, well, well, looks<br> like Minnie's Haberdashery<br> is about to get cozy<br> for the next few days.<br> Yes it does.<br> Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter?<br> The Lincoln what?<br> The letter from Abraham Lincoln?<br> President Abraham Lincoln?<br> - Weren't you pen pals?<br> - With the President?<br> I'm sorry, I heard somebody<br> in your party had a<br> letter from Abraham Lincoln,<br> I assumed it was you.<br> Not him!<br> The black fella' in the stable.<br> The nigger in the stable<br> has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?<br> Yeah.<br> The nigger in the stable<br> has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?<br> Say your name was again?<br> - Bob.<br> - Warren.<br> Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?<br> Minnie and Sweet Dave went to visit her<br> mother on the north side of the mountain.<br> - What?<br> - Yeah.<br> - They ain't here?<br> - Yes, they're visiting her mother.<br> - Her mother?<br> - Yes.<br> I never knew Minnie had a mother.<br> Everybody's got a mother.<br> Yeah, I suppose.<br> - And she left you in charge?<br> - Si.<br> That sure don't sound like Minnie.<br> Are you callin' me a liar?<br> Not yet, I ain't.<br> - But it sounds peculiar, though,<br> - What sound peculiar?<br> Well first of, Minnie never struck me<br> as the sentimental type.<br> Secondly,<br> I can't imagine Sweet<br> Dave liftin' his fat ass<br> outta' his chair long<br> enough to fetch well water,<br> unless Minnie was<br> layin' a fryin' pan upside his head.<br> Along takin' trips to the north side.<br> That sounds a whole lot like you're calling<br> me a liar, mi negro amigo.<br> Yeah it do sound a whole<br> lot like, don't it?<br> But I still haven't done it yet.<br> Minnie still serve food?<br> - Do you consider stew food?<br> - Yes. - Then we serve food.<br> She still stinkin' up the place<br> with her "Old Quail" pipe tobacco?<br> Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.<br> She rolls her own.<br> "Red Apple Tobacco"<br> But mi negro amigo,<br> I think you already know this.<br> Yeah I do, Senor Bob.<br> Just seein' if you do.<br> - Fill me up, O.B.<br> - Yeah.<br> Goddamn it!<br> Thank you.<br> Well cut my legs off and call me Shorty...<br> is that Genaral Sanford Smithers I see?<br> You've got a good eye son.<br> Well, I'll be double dogged damned!<br> General Sandy "Don't give a damn" Smithers!<br> Captain Chris Mannix, Mannix Marauders.<br> - Erskine's boy?<br> - Yes sir.<br> May I sit down, Sir?<br> According to the Yankees,<br> it's a free country.<br> Genaral Sandy Smithers...<br> boy...<br> oh boy.<br> Did my daddy talk about you.<br> I heard you gave those<br> Blue Bellies sweet hell.<br> Me and my boys did our part.<br> Just like Erskine and<br> his boys did their part.<br> Hell yeah, we did.<br> - Yankees sons of bitches?<br> - I never knew your father, son.<br> But, I always respected his resolve.<br> Thank you for saying that, General.

It's a rough life,<br> but folks can learn it.<br> If he had done what he came here to do,<br> he'd a come home.<br> Close it, close it!<br> You have to hold it closed<br> while I nail it shut!<br> Really?

Which,<br> If I remember it correctly,<br> that was one of them Bar of Iron rules,<br> kinda rule,<br> she'd want kept up in her absence.<br> You seem to have a laissez faire<br> attitude when it comes to the hats.<br> I'm guilty.<br> I have a laissez faire<br> attitude about the hats.<br> How about we forget<br> about the hats today,<br> considering there's a<br> blizzard going on and all,<br> and make tomorrow "No Hat Day"?<br> A large black dog.<br> Labrador.<br> You know my daddy,<br> I said that my daddy!<br> Always said that Davis<br> was a courages man.<br> But he should have put capital<br> in Montgomery and not Richmond.<br> Yes, Sir.

I heard 'em hillbilly.<br> Inform this old cracker that<br> I was in Baton Rouge also.<br> On the other side.<br> Oh that's interesting.<br> General Smithers,<br> he said that he was also in Baton Rouge.<br> - On the other-<br> - Cap't Mannix, tell the nigger,<br> that I don't acknowledge<br> niggers in Northern uniforms.<br> You captured a whole<br> Colored Command that day.<br> But not one Colored Trooper<br> made it to a camp, did they?<br> We had neither the time or the food.<br> Nor the inclination<br> to care for Northern horses,<br> and least of all Northern niggers.<br> - So we shot 'em where they stood.<br> - Gentlemen,<br> Gentlemen,<br> I know Americans aren't apt<br> to let a little thing like an unconditional<br> surrender get in the way of a good war.<br> But I strongly suggest we don't restage<br> The Battle of Baton Rouge,<br> during a blizzard<br> in Minnie's Haberdashery.<br> Now, my Nubian friend,<br> while I realize passions are high,<br> that was a while ago.<br> And if you shoot this<br> un-armed old man I guarantee<br> I will hang you by the<br> neck until you are dead.<br> Once we arrive in Red Rock.<br> I damn will guarantee that too.<br> Yeah Warren,<br> that's the problem with old men.<br> You can kick 'em down<br> the stairs and say it's<br> a accident, but ya'<br> can't just shoot 'em.<br> Gentlemen, since we<br> may be trapped here,<br> close together like for a few days,<br> may I suggest a possible solution?<br> We divide Minnie's in half.<br> The Northern side<br> and The Southern Side.<br> With the dinner table<br> operating as a neutral territory.<br> We could say that the<br> fireplace side of the room,<br> acts as a symbolic representative of...<br> Georgia<br> While the bar, represents...<br> Philadelphia!<br> As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree.<br> We still got that deal<br> we talked about in the wagon?<br> I help you protect your eight thousand,<br> you help me protect my ten?<br> One of them fella's<br> is not what he says he is.<br> What is he?<br> He's in cahoots with this one<br> that's what he is.<br> One of them, maybe even two of 'em,<br> is here to see Domergue goes free.<br> And to accomplish that goal,<br> they'll kill everbody in here.<br> And they got 'em coupla' days.<br> So all they gotta' do<br> is sit tight and wait for<br> a winda' of opportunity.<br> And that's when they strike,<br> huh bitch?<br> If you say so, John.<br> Are you sure you're not<br> just being paranoid?<br> Our best bet is this,<br> duplicitous fella' ain't<br> as cool a customer as Daisy here.<br> He won't have the leather patience<br> it takes to just sit here and wait.<br> But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing<br> it's the right one, isn't so easy.<br> If he can't handle it, he'll stop waiting.<br> He'll try and create his opportunity.<br> And that's when Mr.Jumpy reveals himself.<br> And what do you got to say about all this?<br> What do I got to say?<br> About John Ruth's ravings?<br> He's absolutely right.<br> Me and one of them fella's<br> is in cahoots.

You<br> ain't never been cold as<br> your boy was that day.<br> You'd be surprised what a man that cold,<br> would do for a blanket.<br> Wanna know what your boy did?<br> I took my big, black,<br> pecker outta' my pants.<br> And I made him crawl through<br> the snow on all fours over to it.<br> Then I grabbed a hand full<br> of that black hair on the back his head...<br> Then I stuck my big, black Johnson<br> right down his goddamn throat.<br> And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm.<br> You bet your sweet ass it was warm.<br> And Chester Charles Smithers,<br> sucked on that warm black dingus<br> for long as he could.<br> Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'?<br> Your boy...<br> black dudes dingus in his mouth.<br> Him shakin', him cryin'<br> me laughin'<br> and him not understandin'<br> But you understand, doncha' Sandy?<br> I never did give your boy that blanket.<br> Even after all he did,<br> and he did everything I asked.<br> No blanket.<br> That blanket was just<br> a heart breakin' liar's promise.<br> Kinda' like those uniforms<br> the union issued those colored troopers,<br> that you chose not to acknowledge.<br> So what you gonna' do old man?<br> You gonna' spend the<br> next two or three days,<br> ignore the nigger that killed your boy,<br> Ignoring how I made him suffer?<br> Ignoring how I made him...<br> lick, all over my Johnson?<br> The dumbest thing your boy ever did...<br> was to let me know...<br> he was your boy.<br> Chapter Four<br> Domergue's Got a Secret<br> About fifteen minutes has passed,<br> since we last left our characters.<br> Joe Gag volunteered<br> to take Smithers dead body outside.<br> Straws we drawn to see<br> who would help him...<br> O.B. lost.<br> Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo,<br> had vigorous debate about the legality of<br> self-defense murder they just transpired.<br> Marquis Warren who is<br> supremely confident about the<br> legality of what just<br> transpired, ignored them<br> sat at a table by himself<br> and drank brandy.<br> Captain Chris Mannix dawn<br> the dead Generals coat and<br> joined Oswaldo in lighting<br> the candles and lanterns.<br> Hey Ozzy,<br> hey you got the right idea.<br> Let's light this place up.<br> John Ruth held the door close,<br> waiting for Joe Gage and O.B. to return.<br> Bob enjoyed an manzana roja.<br> Domergue, however,<br> hasn't moved from her spot at the community<br> dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her.<br> John Ruth...<br> Yeah?<br> Can I play that guitar over there?<br> Let's go back a bit.<br> Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth.<br> Fifteen minutes ago Major Warren shot<br> General Smithers in front of everybody.<br> But fourty seconds before<br> that, something equally<br> as important happened, but<br> not everybody saw it.<br> While Major Warren was<br> captivating the crowd<br> with tales of black dicks<br> and white mouths...<br> somebody... poisoned the coffy.<br> He did everything I asked, no blanket.<br> And the only one to see 'em do it...<br> was Domergue.<br> That's why this chapter is called...<br> Domergue's Got a Secret.<br> John Ruth.<br> Yeah.<br> Can I play that guitar over there?<br> Yeah.<br> You come back with anything<br> else but a guitar.<br> My pistol plays a tune.<br> Domergues death march, you got it?<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> I got it.<br> That's the one you like to sing<br> in the stagecoach, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> It's kinda' pretty.<br> - Got another verse to it?<br> - Yeah I got.<br> Go ahead, sing it.<br> Gimme that guitar!<br> Music time's over!<br> Turn around.<br> - No, no, no, no, no.<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up!<br> When you get to hell, John.<br> Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'.<br> Mannix the coffy!<br> Oh my god!<br> Gimme that fucking gun!<br> Don't test me, bitch.<br> Everybody get your back sides up<br> against that back wall over yonder.<br> Goddamit-<br> Get or don't get, Joe Gage.<br> It's up to you.<br> - I'll get.<br> - Then get.<br> You too, Senor Bob.<br> Everybody turn around<br> and put your hands on that wall.<br> Move 'em down snowshoes.<br> Everybody keep your mouth<br> shut and do like I say.<br> You open your mouth; you<br> gonna' get a bullet.<br> You move a little sudden, a little strange;<br> you gonna' get a bullet.<br> Not a warning, not a question;<br> a bullet.<br> You got that?<br> - Let me hear you say, "I got it".<br> - "I got it".<br> - "I got it" - "I got it".<br> - We have it.<br> Chris Mannix,<br> come over here on this side.<br> Come on.<br> Take this gun out of my holster.<br> Point it at them.<br> Like I said, anybody does anything.<br> And I mean, anything.<br> Kill 'em.<br> So...<br> you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth<br> 'bout bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?<br> I don't know 'bout all that.<br> But you ain't the killer<br> who poisoned that coffy.<br> 'cos you almost drunk<br> it your own damn self.<br> But one of 'em is.<br> Gimme the key.<br> Gimme the key!<br> You motherfucking black bastard!<br> You're gonna' die on this mountain<br> and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do!<br> What I say 'bout talkin?<br> 'Meant it, didn't I?<br> And you need to understand,<br> you just killed the only<br> man here, comitted to gettin'<br> you to Red Rock alive.<br> Now, one of y'all...<br> is workin' with her.<br> Or two of y'all is workin' with her.<br> Or all y'all is...<br> but only one of you poisoned the coffy.<br> So what charms this bitch got,<br> take a man brave a blizzard,<br> kill in cold blood, I'm<br> sure I don't know.<br> But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman,<br> so you kill him... okay- maybe.<br> But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.<br> He damn sure would.<br> But he sure enough led over there<br> dead now, though, ain't he?<br> He damn sure is you<br> sons of bitches.<br> Just like any one of us<br> who'd drank that coffy.<br> Like me god damnit.<br> Now those of y'all with<br> your hands on the wall<br> don't practice in poison<br> need to think about that.<br> Think about how that coulda' you<br> been you rollin' around on this floor.<br> And about the men standin' next<br> ta' ya' would be responsible.<br> And I know who I got my money on. Yeah<br> that's right Joe Gage I'm lookin' at you.<br> Not so fast Chris.<br> We'll get there.<br> Let's slow it down.<br> Let's slow it way down.<br> Who made the coffy?<br> He did.<br> - Yeah, he did, didn't he?<br> - Yeah, he did, didn't he?<br> But it's the stew that's got me thinking.<br> How long you say Minnie been gone?<br> A week?<br> Si.<br> See, my mama used to make stew.<br> And it always tasted the same,<br> no matter the meat.<br> And there was another fellow<br> on the plantation, Uncle Charly.<br> He made stew too<br> and like my mama's.<br> I ate his stew from the<br> time I was a whipper,<br> to I was a full grown man.<br> And no matter the meat,<br> it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.<br> Now I ain't had Minnie's stew in six<br> months, so I ain't no expert, but that,<br> damn sure is Minnie's stew.<br> So if Minnie's on the north side<br> visiting her mama for a week,<br> how'd she make the stew this morning?<br> And this?<br> This... is Sweet Dave's chair.<br> When I sat in it earlier,<br> I couldn't belive it.<br> Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chaire.<br> This may be Minnie's place,<br> but this is damn sure,<br> Sweet Dave's chair.<br> And if... he went to<br> the north side....<br> I'm pretty goddamn sure<br> that chair's be going with him.<br> What's in the chair?<br> Just what I thought.<br> Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.<br> So...<br> are you actually accusing me of murder?<br> The way I see it, Senior Bob,<br> whoever's workin' with her,<br> ain't who they say they is.<br> And if it's you,<br> that means Minnie<br> and her man ain't at her mama's.<br> They're lyin' out back<br> there dead somewhere.<br> Or if it's you Britisch Man,<br> the real Oswaldo Mobray is lyin'<br> in a ditch somewhere. And<br> you're just an English fella'<br> passin' off his papers.<br> Or we go by my theory, which<br> is the ugliest guy did it.<br> Which makes it you, Joe Gage.<br> So I take it you've<br> deduced the coffy was<br> poisoned while you were<br> murdering the old man?<br> Yes.<br> Well, mi negro amigo,<br> during that whole incident...<br> I was sitting on that side of the room.<br> Playing Silent Night on the piano.<br> I didn't say you poisoned the coffy.<br> I said you didn't make the stew.<br> My theory is...<br> you're working with man<br> who poisoned the coffy.<br> And both of y'all murdered Minnie,<br> and Sweet Dave and whoever<br> else picked this bad luck<br> day to visit Minnie's<br> Haberdashery this morning.<br> And at some point, y'all intented<br> to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy.<br> But you didn't count on the blizzard<br> and you didn't count on the two of us.<br> That's as far as I got.<br> How am I doin'?<br> Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you?<br> So, do you intend to murder me<br> based on a far fetched nigger theory?<br> Or can you prove it, cabrone?<br> It ain't so far fetched, Senior Bob.<br> And it's a little bit more then my theory.<br> How long you say you been<br> working for Minnie's?<br> Four months.<br> If you would have been here<br> two and half years ago<br> you'd know about the sign<br> usta' hang above the bar.<br> - Minnie mentioned that to you?<br> - No.<br> You know what that sign said, Senior Bob?<br> "No dogs or Mexicans allowed"<br> Minnie hung that sign up the<br> day she opened this Habadashery.<br> And it hung over that<br> Bar every day till she<br> took down, a little<br> over two years ago.<br> You know why she took it down?<br> She started lettin' in dogs.<br> Now Minnie likes just about everybody,<br> but she sure don't like Mexicans.<br> So when you tell me, Minnie went<br> to North side to visit her mama?<br> Well I find that highly<br> unlikely... but okay - maybe.<br> But when you tell me Minnie<br> Mink took The Habadashery,<br> the most precious thing to<br> her in the whole world,<br> and left it in hands of a Goddamn Mexican?<br> Well that's what I meant in the barn when I<br> said: "That sure don't sound like Minnie".<br> Now I am calling you a liar, Senior Bob.<br> And if you lyin, which you are,<br> then you killed Minnie -<br> and Sweet Dave.<br> Four measly bulltes and<br> there goes Senior, Bob.<br> That still don't get us no closer...<br> to which one of y'all<br> poisoned the coffy, though.<br> - Does it Chris?<br> - No it sure don't.<br> Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy,<br> to free Daisy.<br> If I don't hear a<br> confession from one of you<br> motherfuckers quick,<br> fast and in a hurry,<br> I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy,<br> down that bitches goddamn throat.<br> Okay, time's up.<br> Stop! Alright I did it,<br> it was me I poisoned the coffy.<br> I fuckin' knew it!<br> You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard.<br> Major Warren please let me<br> sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell.<br> You killed O.B. he's worth ten of you!<br> Warren can I kill him?<br> Say adios to your Huevos.<br> Major Warren?<br> I ain't got no gun, sheriff.<br> Chapter Five The Four Passengers<br> Earlier That Morning.<br> - Hey Charly my, how the hell are you?<br> - Hi ya' Ed, hi ya' Judy-<br> - How many ya' got?<br> - Full house today, friend.<br> We got on in there waiting.<br> Well he's gonna' hafta keep on<br> waitin' cause we ain't got no room.<br> Well you need to tell Minnie.<br> Cause he's been<br> here two days and Minnie<br> wants him outta here.<br> Well I can't give him a seat I don't have -<br> Listen why don't you take the passengers<br> inside, introduce them to Minnie.<br> - Warm youself up and drink some coffy.<br> - Okay.<br> Here we are everybody,<br> Minnie's Haberdashery.<br> Step outside you and<br> your friends can stretch<br> your legs.

Cause I<br> doubt you can drive a four horse team.<br> And that wagon out there is<br> too heavy for a two horse team.<br> So that means you're gonna' hafta'<br> lead a string of horses into Red Rock<br> And with that deep snow after a blizzard,<br> you ain't gonna' be able to get away with<br> any more then let's say one body per horse.<br> So that's you, leading a string of<br> four horses into Red Rock,<br> and with all them horses, in that snow,<br> and you all by your lonesome,<br> you're gonna be a mite poky.<br> And you gonna' run smack<br> dab into The Domergue<br> Gang and agin Grouch,<br> how many is that?<br> - Fifteen killer strong.<br> - And when those fifteen killers,<br> come across you,<br> in possession of all of<br> our dead bodies, they<br> ain't just gonna' kill<br> you and that nigger.<br> There gonna go back to Red Rock<br> and kill every son of a bitch in that town.<br> You really the Sheriff of Red Rock?<br> You wanna save the town?<br> Then shoot that nigger dead!<br> You belive in Jesus now, huh, bitch?<br> Well good 'cos 'bout meet him!<br> Anybody else wanna' make a deal, huh?<br> The deal still stands, Chris.<br> You ain't done we can't forgive.<br> It's still all on that nigger.<br> Shoot 'em dead, take my body<br> and sit out the snow with Daisy and Grou-<br> Mannix!<br> Give me my pistol!<br> Catch 'em here.<br> Catch 'em here.<br> So...<br> you were sayin'...<br> we sit here...<br> all nice and friendly like...<br> for the next two days...<br> then the snow melts,<br> you leave here, meet up<br> with your gang and high tail it to Mexico?<br> Yeah.<br> And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?<br> Yeah.<br> But Jody's worth fifty thousand,<br> what 'bout his body?<br> You gonna make a deal with<br> this diabolical bitch?<br> I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal<br> with her, we're just talkin'. Calm down.<br> So what about Jody's body<br> and the fifty thousand?<br> You've gotten greedy, Reb, no deal.<br> We take Jody's body back with us<br> he got children.<br> So I kill, Warren...<br> and we're all friends?<br> Yeah.<br> No deal, tramp.<br> Chris you're makin' the biggest<br> mistake of your life!<br> When our boys get here in a coupla' days,<br> their gonna cut your nuts off!<br> And there won't be a<br> stick left in that town unburnt.<br> Well I guess I should be<br> plum scared right now, huh?<br> If you had any brains, you would be.<br> You see...<br> here's the problem Daisy.<br> In order for me to be<br> scared of your threats,<br> I got to believe in those fifteen extra<br> gang members waitin' it out in Red Rock.<br> And boy, oh boy...
