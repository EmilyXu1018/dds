I can't change that.<br> Anyway, Mick...<br> ...your mama and l<br> have been figuring things.<br> And we've been going over it,<br> going over it.<br> And the long and short of it is<br> we gotta do something.<br> Like what?<br> We thought you could, uh, keep working<br> down to the five-and-dime...<br> ...and go to school nights.<br> Just for this next year.<br> Oh, Papa, I can't quit school.<br> I just can't.<br> Well, you won't be quitting.<br> You'll just be going nights.<br> I've seen kids do that.<br> Pretty soon, they don't go nights either.<br> Margaret, maybe there's some way...<br> -...we haven't figured yet--<br> -Of what?<br> The only other way<br> is for me to get a job.<br> Mick would have to stay home<br> to look after you and the boys.<br> No, this is the only way.<br> But Mama, I wanna make something<br> of myself, Mama.<br> I got this feeling inside me<br> like I was destined for something.<br> We all have that feeling<br> when we are young.<br> It will pass.<br> Margaret, don't.<br> Well, I know it won't be easy.<br> But without a high school diploma,<br> what chance have I got?<br> The same chance I had.<br> You'll meet some fellow and get married.<br> If you're lucky, you'll love him.<br> You'll have kids.<br> That's what life is, Mick. That's all it is.<br> -You make it sound awful.<br> -No.<br> -It's not awful.<br> MRS.
