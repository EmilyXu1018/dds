                        So, what's new, Eddie?<br> Anything exciting?<br> Yeah, we just got those new Nike<br> SasQuatch drivers into the store,<br> so that's been kind of cool.<br> Let me rephrase the question.<br> You been crushing any pussy?<br> No, Dad,<br> I haven't been crushing any pussy.<br> Seriously, who you booming?<br> Dad, seriously,<br> I'm not "booming" anybody,<br> I'm just kind of dating a little right now.<br> I don't get you.<br> You refuse to get married,<br> yet you don't really enjoy the fruits<br> of bachelor life.<br> It's like you're living<br> in a purgatory over here.<br> Dad, I don't refuse to get married.<br> It's just I wanna do it<br> with the right person, okay?<br> I'm sorry to ride you, pal.<br> I just want you to be happy.<br> I hate you to be alone<br> on Valentine's Day.<br> I won't be. I'm going to a wedding.<br> Oh. Now you're talking.<br> Weddings are a great place<br> to meet women.<br> Who's getting married?<br> Jodi.<br> Jodi?<br> What are you...<br> What?<br> - Are you serious?<br> - Dad. Come on.<br> - Eddie, don't do this to yourself.<br> - We're still friends.<br> I'm just saying, watching<br> your ex-fiance walk down the aisle<br> on Valentine's Day might sting a little.<br> No. We're way past that.<br> Really. I mean, if anything,<br> it's gonna be cathartic.<br> Give me a little closure.<br> I think it's flat-out wrong,<br> but maybe I'm just old-fashioned.<br> Come on, skip the wedding.<br> You and me, we'll head to Vegas.<br> Maybe we'll get lucky and tag-team<br> a couple of broads.<br> Yeah, I have to say the idea<br> of a tag team<br> with my 77-year-old father<br> is extremely tempting,<br> but I already RSVP'd, so...<br> I appreciate the offer.<br> Come on, come on.<br> Hey, can I get a beer, please?<br> - And I will get a Cosmopolitan.<br> - No problem.<br> Cosmopolitan?<br> Isn't that sort of a female-type drink?<br> Oh yeah. Yeah.<br> Tammy turned me on to them.<br> And I pretty much drink<br> what she drinks, so...<br> Oh. Really?<br> Yeah. Happy wife, happy life.<br> That's a good one.<br> "Happy wife, happy life." I like that.<br> - Rhymes. Must be true.<br> - Yeah. Thank you.<br> Wow. Look at Jodi.<br> She looks great, huh?<br> Yeah, she looks really good.<br> And she's got the kind of looks<br> that are gonna last, you know?<br> Look at her mom.<br> Oh, what a cougar.<br> Some good genes there.<br> Hey. Come on.<br> Look, you had five years to pull<br> the trigger with Jodi, okay?<br> And if I recall, you had plenty<br> of reasons for calling it off.<br> Yeah. I know. I'm just trying<br> to remember what they were.<br> God, there was a million of them.<br> "She doesn't like my fantasy football<br> league. She never shares her food.<br> "She doesn't try anything new."<br> Man, what are you...<br> That's not my voice.<br> That's you. That's exactly you.<br> That's spot-on you.<br> I don't sound like an Italian mouse.<br> Little bit.<br> I do not-a talk-a like this.<br> Oh, yeah? Okay, remember this one?<br> "She hates-a Caddyshack-a."<br> Yeah, and you know why<br> she hates-a Caddyshack?<br> 'Cause she said that<br> the gopher looked too fake.<br> Come on, that would bother you.<br> Oh, totally. Totally.<br> Throw away a chance at happiness<br> because the gopher looks fake.<br> Come on, man.<br> You've never been married.<br> You're 40 years old.<br> Eddie, at some point you're just gonna<br> have to close your eyes and jump.<br> I did it. I'm the happiest guy I know.<br> - Hey, Eddie.<br> - Oh, hey.<br> - How are you?<br> - I'm good. How are you doing?<br> Good, good. Are you sad?<br> No.<br> Oh, good. Good.<br> Mac, come on, honey, we gotta go.<br> Everyone's already at our table.<br> - Lead the way, gorgeous.<br> - Is that for me?<br> - No, that's his.<br> - Oh. Well, it's mine now.<br> What table you at, Eddie?<br> I am at table 34.<br> - Oh, too bad. We're at 11.<br> - We're at 11.<br> - Okay. See you later.<br> - All right.<br> - Save me a dance.<br> - Okay.<br> - Don't forget.<br> - I won't.<br> - Mac, come on.<br> - Bye. Gotta go.<br> Cheers!<br> And that was that!<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey, are you running this whole thing?<br> Oh, sure.<br> Walk up to the first homo you see<br> and assume he's<br> the wedding coordinator, right? Nice.<br> - No, no. I didn't mean that.<br> - Nice stereotype, buddy, nice.<br> Did I hear someone<br> say "wedding coordinator"?<br> That would be moi.<br> So, how can I help you?<br> So, how can I help you?<br> I think there's been a mistake, 'cause<br> I'm at table 34, but that's the kids' table.<br> Oh, oh. That's not the kids' table.<br> That's the singles' table. Enjoy.<br> Wife couldn't make it, huh?<br> No wife.<br> Oh. Divorced?<br> No.<br> Girlfriend?<br> Kind of in-between right now.<br> Sort of playing the field and<br> keeping my options open, you know?<br> Hey, mister.<br> - What?<br> - Are you gay?<br> - No.<br> - Yes! You owe me 10 bucks.<br> Hold on, hold on. Are you bi?<br> No. No, I'm not bi.<br> See? It's a tie. We both lose.<br> Are you like a widow or something?<br> Yeah. I'm a widow. That's... Yeah.<br> - Sorry.<br> - He's full of it. He's gay.<br> No. I'm not gay.<br> - Let's play five-in-five, then.<br> - What is that?<br> It's where I ask you five questions<br> in five seconds.<br> If you're telling the truth,<br> then you shouldn't have to think.<br> Yeah. I don't wanna play your game.<br> Sorry.<br> - Quick. How'd your wife die?<br> - Murdered.<br> - How?<br> - Ice pick.<br> - They get the guy?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What was his name?<br> - Ronald.<br> Brad Pitt, Russell Crowe. Who's hotter?<br> Brad Pitt.<br> - What? I thought you...<br> - Yeah, we got you.<br> No, I thought you meant<br> who's hotter career-wise.<br> You're totally busted.<br> - Gay.<br> - Gay.<br> You're gay.<br> And I just want you all to know that<br> Jodi is the only woman I've ever loved.<br> And I wanna thank her for letting me<br> into her fairytale life.<br> And that's not to say I didn't have to<br> kiss a few frogs before I met my prince.<br> Cantrow! Did you hear that?<br> But seriously, Michael has been<br> the answer to all my prayers.<br> And quite frankly, he's the only guy<br> my father ever approved of.<br> And that's because he's<br> the first guy she ever went out with<br> who wasn't a total asshole.<br> All right, all right, okay.<br> Look, thank you all for coming.<br> We're gonna have some fun<br> today, right?<br> Stop him, he's got my purse!<br> Somebody stop him!<br> Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!<br> Fuck off, man!<br> This has nothing to do with you!<br> Calm down, buddy, give me the purse.<br> Back off, man! I swear to God,<br> I'll cut your fucking head off!<br> - Give me the...<br> - I will snap you!<br> No, man, that's mine. It's mine!<br> Hey, man, man, it's mine. It's mine!<br> It's mine!<br> Shit.<br> Shit!<br> Oh, God, are you okay?<br> No, it stings. He Maced me.<br> It's just my perfume.<br> Shit, I can't believe this!<br> I've got everything in there.<br> My credit card, my wallet.<br> Everything is in that bag.<br> My license, my keys,<br> my life.<br> Yeah, that guy, he's like a freak.<br> I mean, I just... I tried to stop him, but...<br> Sorry. I almost had him.<br> No, no, it's not your fault.<br> I should have, like, punched him<br> or something. I'm sorry.<br> Thank you.<br> It was really cool of you to get involved.<br> - Here. Let me help you with this stuff.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Oh. I'm sorry. I don't wanna...<br> I don't know what the protocol there is.<br> It's okay. I got it. No problem.<br> Okay. Nice undergarment there.<br> So, there you go.<br> So, you live around here?<br> Yes, I do. Yeah, I do.<br> I actually live a couple blocks down.<br> - Over by Bay City Sports?<br> - Bay City Sports? I...<br> Yeah, a big sports... Sort of sporting<br> goods emporium, over on Van Ness.<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I know that.<br> - I actually own the place, so...<br> - Oh, cool.<br> - Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.<br> - That's great. Oh, this is me.<br> - That's you? Okay.<br> I don't have any money.<br> He took my wallet.<br> Wait a minute. Here. I got it.<br> Oh, no. I wasn't saying it to...<br> You've done enough. Really.<br> No. Here. Please. Please.<br> I got a five-spot. Here you go.<br> Go ahead. Take it. I got like hundreds<br> of dollars in the bank, so I'm good.<br> - I can't take it, then.<br> - No, I'm kidding. I do fine.<br> I mean, I'm not rich, I'm comfortable.<br> I'm good. Go ahead. Get on the thing.<br> - Got it.<br> - All right.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - Thank you.<br> All right.<br> Hey, what's your name?<br> Lila!<br> Lila, I'm Eddie! Eddie... Eddie Cantrow!<br> Okay!<br> Shit.<br> Oh, yeah. This is your girl, Eddie.<br> I've always said you can tell a lot<br> about a woman by her panties.<br> When have you ever said that?<br> I've said it like a mantra.<br> You just don't pay attention.<br> So, did you get her digits?<br> No, I didn't get her digits.<br> The girl had just gotten mugged.<br> I wasn't gonna hit on her.<br> Wait a second. She's hot, friendly,<br> it's Valentine's Day, she's all alone...<br> She has David Bowie, your all-time<br> favorite musician, pasted on her undies.<br> And you don't think to ask her out?<br> It was... A lot was going on.<br> I mean, I had just gotten sprayed<br> in the eye by a very sting-y perfume.<br> I was disoriented. I was...<br> And it never occurred to you<br> to chase the trolley down the street,<br> waving her underwear<br> and calling out her name?<br> No! I mean, look,<br> this girl was incredibly gorgeous.<br> There's no way in hell she's single.<br> I'm sure she's got, like, a dot-com<br> billionaire boyfriend.<br> A billionaire<br> who makes her do the wash<br> at a laundromat on Valentine's Day.<br> Come on, Eddie! She was available.<br> You wimped out.<br> Oh, that's my wife.<br> Okay.<br> Hey, honey.<br> Yeah.<br> Okay, sure, you got it. Right away.<br> All right, guys. I'm on husband duty.<br> Aunt Flo just arrived at our house.<br> Who's Aunt Flo?<br> Tammy just got her period,<br> so gotta pick her up some Maxibons.<br> Is there anything that she asks you to<br> do that you don't jump to attention for?<br> No. Why? I wanna make her happy.<br> That's why I grew out the bangs.<br> Sorry you let that girl go, Eddie.<br> Sounded like a keeper.<br> - Thank you, makes me feel better.<br> - You're welcome.<br> He speaketh the truth.<br> All you had to do was ask her out<br> for coffee or a goddamn piece of pie.<br> Oh, pie. Yeah, pie really would've<br> clinched the deal, Dad.<br> I'm just saying, when you<br> happen on ass-floss like these,<br> you don't let them get away.<br> I'm late for a root canal. Be good.<br> All right, Ralphie, let's go.<br> Shit. Eddie, what am I doing wrong?<br> All right. First of all, don't ever swing<br> at the first pitch. You gotta be patient.<br> - But the ball was right down the middle.<br> - It was a little high and inside.<br> Hey, pussydick, can you break away<br> for nine holes?<br> You know what?<br> I'm in the middle of something, Dad.<br> Listen, everybody wants<br> to hit homers, right?<br> But the fact is,<br> a walk's as good as a hit.<br> - It is?<br> - Yeah.<br> That's the worst piece of advice<br> I ever heard.<br> - Swing at the next one, slugger.<br> - No, wait.<br> You want me to swing or wait?<br> Listen to me, I'm older than him. Swing!<br> - Wait.<br> - Swing!<br> No, Dad, now you're screwing him up.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Dad, that's her.<br> - Who?<br> That's the girl I was telling you<br> about, Lila. You gotta get out of here.<br> - Go. Go, go, go.<br> - Relax. I'm not gonna blow your cover.<br> But it's nice to put a face to the panties.<br> Where did you get those?<br> Will you calm down? They're not for me.<br> I was just gonna bring them by the club!<br> What?<br> A guy can't brag about his own kid?<br> - No, Dad. Dad.<br> - Give me. Give me.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey.<br> I was in the neighborhood<br> looking for a fleece.<br> What do you think?<br> Excellent taste.<br> That's my dad.<br> Hi, Dad.<br> Nice to meet you, Lila.<br> How do you know my name?<br> Okay, cat's out of the bag.<br> My son found your panties<br> on the sidewalk,<br> and we've been talking<br> about you all week.<br> Eddie, give her back<br> her undies, will you?<br> Here you go.<br> I was watching those for you,<br> hoping you'd come in and claim them.<br> It worked out.<br> - Okay.<br> - We're good now.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Okay. My work here is done.<br> Let me go.<br> He's so cute.<br> Yeah, he is. He's a cutie.<br> - So, what do you think?<br> - Well, what are you looking to do?<br> You looking to just go hiking,<br> or bopping around town, or...<br> Little bit of both, probably.<br> Okay, well, they're both<br> quick-dry material, which is good,<br> 'cause it wicks away the sweat<br> from the surface,<br> allows it to evaporate quickly.<br> But if I was gonna go with one,<br> I'd probably go with the Patagonia,<br> 'cause it's 100% recycled material.<br> Hey, you a pie fan?<br> A fan of pie? Do you like pie? The...<br> Pie? Food? Pie.<br> Oh, pie. Like apple pie, and...<br> Yeah, I love pie.<br> Get out of town.<br> So you're an environmental researcher.<br> Why do you sound so surprised?<br> No, it's just, I mean, you know,<br> you don't really look like<br> the prototypical scientist type.<br> Well, it's not really that scientific.<br> It's more, you know...<br> - It's just researching.<br> - Right. I know. Just research.<br> Well, it is.<br> Well, I'm sure you make it sound<br> much simpler than it is, but...<br> For us knuckleheads who, you know,<br> sell baseball gloves...<br> No, you're not a knucklehead.<br> Eddie...<br> Can I be honest with you?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> I didn't really need that fleece<br> that I bought today.<br> I came in the store today to see you.<br> Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, cool.<br> I mean, if you wanna return the fleece,<br> it's fine, seriously.<br> Oh, no, Eddie, I don't.<br> I don't wanna return it.<br> Okay, but just know<br> that that's okay, too.<br> - No, I love it.<br> - I mean, aside from all of this other...<br> Eddie, I think it's perfect for me.<br> You're not mad?<br> Of course I'm not mad.<br> I don't want you to do anything<br> you're not comfortable with. Come on.<br> I know it's silly. I mean,<br> it's not like I'm a virgin or anything.<br> Lila, you don't owe me<br> any explanations, okay? Really.<br> I know, but I just want you<br> to understand where I'm coming from.<br> I just...<br> I've seen how sleeping together<br> too soon can ruin a relationship,<br> and I don't wanna risk what we have.<br> 'Cause what we have<br> is really, really nice.<br> Last time I checked,<br> we're not in a race, right?<br> Cool.<br> - All right.<br> - All right.<br> - Good night.<br> - Night.<br> Sleep well.<br> I will.<br> Eddie, phone call, Line 3.

I can't do it.<br> "I wanna be a researcher, but I'm not,<br> you know, I'm not gonna..."<br> Eddie, this is my career.<br> I can't say that.<br> I understand that,<br> but can't you, like, just say, you know...<br> Isn't there somebody else<br> who wants to go?<br> No, it's either me or this other<br> researcher, and he's married.<br> So what?<br> So, they don't move married people.<br> It's policy.<br> So what are the negatives?<br> Well, for one thing,<br> I've only known her for six weeks.<br> That's half a summer, Eddie.<br> I proposed to your mother<br> after three dates.<br> She gave me 18<br> of the best years of my life.<br> You were engaged to Jodi for five years.<br> What good did that do you?<br> All right, yeah,<br> but there's other stuff, too.<br> Such as?<br> She doesn't have<br> a great sense of humor.<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> Funny's a male gene, you idiot.<br> Haven't you ever noticed,<br> whenever you see a really funny girl,<br> she's a little mannish?<br> Think about it. Lily Tomlin,<br> Evelyn DeGeneres, Rosie O'Donnell...<br> Oh, I got a thing<br> for Ellen DeGeneres, though.<br> I do. I have to admit it.<br> I think she's great. I think she's hot.<br> Great ass.<br> Check it out.<br> All right, you know what?<br> Forget that stuff, okay? She's wonderful.<br> She's an incredible girl.<br> There's no better. Okay?<br> Still, just the idea of marriage.<br> It's just so permanent. You know?<br> It's like...<br> It's like at the end of the day,<br> I'm choosing between Lila<br> and all the other women in the world.<br> You've barely nailed<br> any of the other women in the world.<br> You haven't crushed more than three<br> pussies since you broke off with Jodi.<br> Dad, what is this obsession<br> with pussy-crushing counting?<br> I really, I just...<br> I'm not comfortable with that term.<br> Sorry. Snatch. Whatever.<br> - Who do you think you are?<br> - Huh?<br> Just who the hell<br> do you think you are, Eddie, huh?<br> Sitting here, trying to come up<br> with reasons not to marry this girl?<br> You should be thanking God<br> that a woman this fantastic<br> would even consider you.<br> Now, unless you wanna be<br> the 75-year-old dad<br> at the Little League game,<br> I suggest you get on with your life,<br> 'cause that's what this is, Eddie.

What are you guys doing here?<br> I don't know.<br> We're on vacation with our parents.<br> You look disappointed to see us.<br> What? Did you think<br> this was a gays-only resort?<br> For your information,<br> the hot blond over there, she's with me.<br> That's who I'm gonna<br> be sleeping with tonight, so...<br> I'll give you this. It's impressive.<br> - Yeah.<br> - How does he do it?<br> Does he tuck his balls under<br> or does he tape them up real high?<br> You know what? Why don't you take<br> your little Human Genome Project<br> and hit the road?<br> You homophobic hobbits.<br> Punks.<br> Do you think you could tell me<br> where I could find Uncle Tito?<br> Yes. May I ask who is inquiring?<br> Yeah, my name's Eddie Cantrow,<br> and I'm a friend of a friend of his.<br> I'm supposed to give him something.<br> I'm sorry to tell you this,<br> but he no longer works here.<br> He's actually in jail<br> serving six to ten years.<br> He was caught running cock fights,<br> and I'm not speaking about<br> the kind with roosters.<br> Really?<br> Screw off! I'm joking, man!<br> Come on! I am Uncle Tito!<br> Pleasure to meet you.<br> You're Uncle Tito! Okay.<br> You should have seen<br> the look on your face.<br> Did you bring the present from Mac?<br> Yes, I did. Yes.<br> Here... Yeah, here you go.<br> It's funny, I... Uncle Tito. I was thinking<br> of, like, an older, gray-haired...<br> - Yes.<br> - I don't know why.<br> - You like the hair?<br> - I like it. You got a whole...<br> Pardon me.<br> I was wanting to know if we could...<br> Here is the adult sex tape you ordered,<br> Seor Cantrow.<br> I will bill it to your room.<br> Would you like me<br> to bring up any more?<br> No. Thank you.<br> Perfecto!<br> You will have a fun night tonight.<br> Baby, you've gotta try this Mind Eraser.<br> The guy put in, like,<br> four shots of Patrn.<br> You are even more sexier<br> than Mac described.<br> Thank you.<br> I was not talking to you,<br> I was talking to him.<br> Screw off! I'm joking, man!<br> Come on. You are unbelievably hot.<br> By the way, please put your jewelry<br> inside the safe.<br> I cannot tell you how many<br> honeymooners come down here<br> and they lose their rings on the beach.<br> - It's very sad.<br> - Okay, thanks for the tip.<br> Also, Mac's a pal, so I want you to know<br> I totally set you guys up.<br> I got you the honeymoon suite.<br> Hey, all right, thank you!<br> This is amazing!<br> How beautiful is this?<br> Man. Look at that view.<br> Eddie, think fast!<br> Honey, come on! Babe!<br> You could take out an eye<br> with that thing.<br> Oh, hush, I didn't come close.<br> Man, look at this place.<br> Jeez. Wonder how much<br> the room costs.<br> Oh, honey, stop worrying about money.<br> This is our honeymoon.<br> We're gonna remember this<br> for the next 40 to 50 years.<br> You're right.<br> I'm thinking like a single guy.<br> I gotta remember<br> we're a two-income family now.<br> Really? You have a second job?<br> No, I mean my salary, your salary.<br> - My salary?<br> - Yeah. Oh, what?<br> You wanna keep our finances<br> separate now?<br> Honey, I'm a volunteer.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Well, how much do volunteers make?<br> A volunteer is a volunteer.<br> I help raise money for my<br> environmental group. I told you this.<br> So they force volunteers<br> to move to Rotterdam?<br> Unmarried volunteers?<br> They don't force them.<br> But if you wanna get in good with<br> the company, you gotta play the game.<br> You told me<br> you're an environmental researcher.<br> Yeah, I am.<br> Unless you don't count wading in<br> the freezing-cold San Francisco Bay<br> for three months, measuring PCBs<br> and getting stung by jellyfish,<br> which I won't even tell you what<br> they had to do to take the pain away.<br> They had to pee on me.<br> You get stung by a jellyfish, that makes<br> you an environmental researcher?<br> You know what, Eddie? I love my job<br> and I don't have to defend it to you.<br> Job? No, no, no. I don't think<br> you're allowed to call it a job.<br> Job? No, no, no. I don't think<br> you're allowed to call it a job.<br> Oh, really?<br> And what am I supposed to call it?<br> A hobby?<br> - A hobby?<br> - A hobby. You get paid for a job.<br> - Says who?<br> - Says the dictionary.<br> Well, who reads the dictionary?<br> Not everybody.<br> Yeah, apparently not! A "job" is a word.<br> There is a definition for it!<br> You married me for my money.<br> What? No, wait a minute, wait a minute.<br> Don't turn this around.<br> What's next? You're gonna steal<br> my purse, like my last boyfriend did?<br> Your last boyfriend stole your purse?<br> Duh! You were there!<br> That was your boyfriend?<br> That maniac mugger guy?<br> That was my ex-boyfriend.<br> The crazy guy on the bike<br> was your ex-boyfriend?<br> - Yes.<br> - And you didn't tell me this. Why?<br> Why would I?<br> You and I were complete strangers.<br> So... And why was he<br> stealing your purse?<br> Because he owed me money,<br> so I took his wallet.<br> And I'm not about to leave it<br> in my apartment,<br> because then he'd break in<br> and steal it back.<br> So I kept it in my purse,<br> along with his keys and his cell phone.<br> And let me tell you something else<br> about my little "hobby."<br> One day, our kids are gonna<br> inhabitate this Earth.<br> And I'm just trying to make sure<br> that there's some aqua life<br> left for when they do!<br> - That's not a word.<br> - What's not a word?<br> "Inhabitate." Not a word.<br> Oh, really? Why don't you look it up<br> in your little "dictionary,"<br> and why don't you look up "shitfuck"<br> while you're at it?<br> I will look it up with "shitfuck"!<br> And guess what?<br> I won't find "inhabitate" or "shitfuck"!<br> Fuck! Shit!<br> Lila?<br> Lila?<br> This is stupid.<br> Excuse me.<br> A little help?<br> Sorry, I dropped my camera.<br> Doesn't look broken.<br> No, don't throw it. I'll be right down.<br> Okay.<br> - Here you go.<br> - Thanks.<br> I didn't mean to sneak up on you.<br> I was...<br> Oh, yeah. No problem.<br> Was that you this morning<br> at Reception?<br> Yeah.<br> That wasn't what it looked like.<br> Just looked like<br> you were renting a videotape.<br> No, no, I know, but I wasn't.<br> I mean, that wasn't... I wasn't.<br> You don't have to explain to me.<br> All right? Boys will be boys.<br> I got a cousin who drives a truck with<br> a bumper sticker that says "Born Hard."<br> Right. Okay, but I'm not that guy.<br> I mean, I'm not...<br> Miranda!<br> We're getting ready to play Parcheesi!<br> Please come upstairs.<br> I'm coming, I'm coming.<br> - That's my cousin.<br> - That's your cousin?<br> - We're down here for a family reunion.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> Yeah. My aunt and uncle renew<br> their wedding vows every year.<br> It's a little hokey, but they're still in love<br> after 42 years, God bless them.<br> - So we go along with it.<br> - That's nice.<br> Yeah. What about you? What's got you<br> standing out here mumbling to yourself?<br> Running low on your medication?<br> Was I mumbling?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Audibly?<br> Miranda!<br> We are all ready to play Parcheesi.<br> I'm coming!<br> All right, okay.<br> Hope your camera's okay.<br> Happy mumbling.<br> Hey.<br> I am so sorry.<br> - No, no, no. Honey, I'm sorry.<br> - No, I'm sorry.<br> No, no, no. I'm sorry.<br> Look, really. Look, first of all,<br> I love that you love the fishes, okay?<br> And I think it's great that you wanna<br> clean up the ocean, okay?<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, I'm just, you know...<br> - Eddie.<br> - I got all worked up.<br> - But you were right, Eddie.<br> - No, no.<br> Yes. They should have been paying me<br> a long time ago.<br> Whatever. Whatever.<br> No, but really, I mean...<br> How am I ever gonna get out of debt<br> if I keep letting them do this to me?<br> - How are you gonna what?<br> - Get out of debt.<br> You're in debt? What kind of debt?<br> You know, the kind where you owe<br> a lot of money to people.<br> How much money?<br> Well, it's not so bad. I mean,<br> ever since I stopped doing the blow,<br> it's down to about 26 K.<br> You had a... You snorted...<br> You had a cocaine problem?<br> That's how I got<br> the deviated septum, remember?<br> You said you had a deviated septum.<br> You didn't say that you had a...<br> You know...<br> Snorting the cocaine.<br> Yeah, but that's how you get<br> a deviated septum.<br> I didn't... Okay.<br> That kid at camp, he didn't have<br> a blow problem, you know. He was...<br> Well, how do you know?<br> Because he was eight<br> and he was my bunkmate.<br> I mean, you know,<br> I would have been aware...<br> Tell me a little bit more<br> about this, though.<br> You know, it's a chapter of my life<br> that I'm not particularly proud of.<br> Right, right.<br> But you know what?<br> If I had to do it all over again,<br> I wouldn't change a darn thing.<br> Because it made me who I am today.<br> And do you know<br> who I am today, Eddie?<br> No. Who are you?<br> I'm Mrs. Edmund Cantrow.<br> Edward.<br> "Edward"? You didn't tell me that!<br> I... Yeah, Edward.<br> Well, Mr. Cantrow.<br> Are there any other dark, dirty secrets<br> that I should know about?<br> Cock me.

I got some.<br> Are you becoming a control freak?<br> I mean, first the thing about having<br> to tip the maid every day, and now this?<br> Forget about it, Eddie. I'll just do it<br> myself if it's such a problem.<br> I'm just saying<br> the sun's really different down here.<br> I'm just saying<br> the sun's really different down here.<br> The sun is the sun, Eddie.<br> Honey!<br> Oh, Grouchy Marx, calm down.<br> Hey, look.

No?<br> It's not my fault.<br> It's the stupid Mexican ozone!<br> No. The Mexican ozone<br> isn't stupid, Lila.<br> You just needed to wear<br> some sunscreen.<br> I was trying to get a tan.<br> No, you were trying to get "savage."<br> Whose side are you on, Eddie?<br> - What? What sides are there?<br> - Mine or the ozone's? Choose one!<br> I'm on your side, all right?<br> Just calm down.<br> Now look, I'm gonna put a little<br> of this aloe on your back, okay?<br> Should make you feel better.<br> You fucking cunt!<br> Or not.<br> Hello?<br> Hey, Pop, it's me.<br> Listen, is this a good time?<br> I'm in Vegas. Flew out for the weekend.<br> Here, I want you to say hi to somebody.<br> Hi, Eddie, this is Patty!<br> Yeah, I met your father playing keno.<br> What a hot ticket.<br> Hey, I heard you got married.<br> Congratulations.<br> Your father says she's amazing.<br> Not really. Can I talk to my dad?<br> All right.<br> What's up? You okay, kid?<br> No, I'm not okay.<br> Dad, I got big, big problems here.<br> I think Lila might be...<br> I think she might be a little off.<br> Kitty ring? So, let me get this straight.<br> You think your wife's a nutcase<br> because on your honeymoon,<br> in a tropical paradise,<br> she's singing a lot,<br> wanting to have sex around the clock,<br> and, accidentally,<br> she got a little too much sun?<br> Well, yeah, but it's a lot worse<br> than it sounds.<br> Now listen to me,<br> and listen to me good!<br> When your wife on her honeymoon<br> asks you to cock her,<br> you cock her good, God damn it!<br> - Seor Eddie, are you finished?<br> - Yeah. Thanks, Tito.<br> Where is your lovely wife this evening?<br> She got a little too much sun,<br> so she decided to crash out early.<br> Are you sure it was the sun<br> that made her tired, and not you?<br> You.<br> - Tito!<br> - Yes, seorita.<br> All right, I want another round,<br> but make it Flytails this time.<br> No problem.<br> Hey.<br> Hey! What are you doing<br> down here at the bar?<br> VCR break down?<br> I was starting to chafe. So...<br> Well, that's the way it goes.<br> - You're Miranda, right?<br> - I am.<br> I'm Eddie.<br> - Nice to meet you, officially.<br> - Nice to meet you, too.<br> What's a Flytail?<br> I've got no idea,<br> but it's got tequila and a cool name,<br> so I thought I'd give it a whirl.<br> I like your thinking.<br> You know who figured out<br> how to do it right?<br> The people who live in the spots<br> where the rest of us vacation.<br> Oh, yeah. You mean<br> like those perma-vacationers.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Though, I don't know.<br> You think they're really having<br> that good a time?<br> - Oh, hell yeah.<br> - Really?<br> - Oh, of course.<br> - Really? I don't know.<br> I mean, I always feel like those people,<br> like, must be running from something.<br> They're running from their boring lives.<br> You know, most people get two or three<br> weeks of vacation to have fun.<br> These people, man,<br> they party all year round.<br> Yeah. Where are you from?<br> - Oxford, Mississippi.<br> - Really?<br> You don't have an accent.<br> - Excuse me?<br> - Yeah?<br> Are you here on your honeymoon?<br> Actually, I am.<br> Are you having a good time?<br> We're having an incredible time.<br> We're having the time of our lives.<br> What the hell are you doing down here?<br> Why don't you go to your room?<br> She's...<br> Here are your Flytails.<br> Thank you!<br> Sweetheart, will you help me<br> with the drinks?<br> Yeah, sure, Dream Weaver.<br> No problem. Just gonna help her.<br> Take it easy.<br> Hey, next time you tell people<br> we're married,<br> I'd appreciate<br> if you at least acted happy.<br> Yeah, well, actually...<br> Miranda! Where have you been?<br> Relax, everybody, I got more booze.<br> - This is my friend, Eddie.<br> - Hi.<br> Hey, how'd you manage<br> to make a friend down here, Miranda?<br> I put an ad in the paper.<br> Eddie, this is my family, starting with<br> my aunt and uncle, Beryl and Boo.<br> Beryl and Boo.<br> It's your anniversary, right?<br> - That's right.<br> - Congratulations.<br> Thank you.<br> I think that's a beautiful name, Boo.<br> Is that short for something?<br> I'm Boo.<br> Sorry.<br> - Yeah, it's short for Buford.<br> - Buford?<br> Okay.<br> But why don't they call you "Byoo"?<br> Byoo! Why didn't we ever think of that?<br> It's been sitting there for 30 years<br> and we never even noticed it.<br> And then you walk up, and boom!<br> You are a hair-trigger is what you are.<br> That is too funny.<br> These are my cousins, Buzz and Martin.<br> - Hello, Mr. Funny, I'm Buzz.<br> - Pleasure to meet you.<br> And their lovely wives,<br> Deborah and Gayla.<br> I remember you, Eddie.<br> You're the film buff, right?<br> And the lovely man in the back is<br> my Grandpa Anderson.<br> Hi there.<br> Well, nice to meet all of you guys.<br> I'm gonna get running,<br> but have a great night.<br> - Excuse me, seor.<br> - Yeah?<br> You have a round of shots<br> from your new friends.<br> Oh! Well!<br> Thank you.<br> Nope. Deborah and myself will not<br> be having any, thank you.<br> Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass also.<br> I just... Yeah. I think I'm gonna...<br> Yeah, I don't think you're gonna<br> get off that easy, sweetheart.<br> Thank you!<br> Well, might as well give them<br> their money's worth. Thank you.<br> Hey, here's to Beryl and Byoo.<br> He did it again!<br> You are too much.<br> All right, everybody. Are you ready?<br> Bottoms up!<br> This is awful! That's, like, awful!<br> It's like somebody<br> gets inside your chest<br> and just like, a guy with, like, a bongo.<br> And we gotta pay for it!<br> That's the punchline. Oh, man.<br> So, Martin, you're<br> a high school baseball coach.<br> - Yeah.<br> - That is so cool.<br> Boo actually coached the team<br> before Martin did.<br> Never missed a game in 28 years.<br> Well, there were a few games<br> I wish I had missed.<br> And Miranda coaches<br> the women's lacrosse team at Ole Miss.<br> That's right.<br> - I do.<br> - You're a lacrosse coach?<br> - I am.<br> - That is... Wow. That's...<br> - So you're a whole family of coaches.<br> - Yes, we are.<br> You know, there was a big article about<br> them in the Oxford Eagle.<br> You could still probably find that online.<br> That's amazing.<br> And what about you, Buzz?<br> I'm not a coach.<br> I have a couple Subway sandwich shops<br> in the Oxford area.<br> And we're about to open up<br> a third on Route 122.<br> We find if you keep the tuna fresh,<br> they'll keep coming back.<br> At Subway. Oh, I love Subway.<br> We're also gonna open<br> a Ruby Tuesday's.<br> We're gonna take it to the next level.<br> But that's this, okay?<br> That's right. Don't let it leave this circle.<br> That's exciting. That's great.<br> We wanna keep it all,<br> you know, class organizations,<br> good food, served in a hurry.<br> And with metal silverware this time.<br> - That's cool.<br> - How about you, Eddie?<br> You a sports fan?<br> I am. Actually, I own a sporting goods<br> store up in San Francisco.<br> Yeah. I love sports.<br> In fact, I even lost my virginity<br> on a baseball diamond.<br> - You're too much. Really?<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> Couple of the older kids<br> pushed me down, and...<br> It was not pretty.<br> Did you file charges?<br> No.<br> - He was making a joke, Gayla.<br> - Yeah, I was just...<br> About anal rape?<br> You are a pistol.<br> My point is,<br> why do we always assume<br> that the aliens from the spaceships<br> are people?<br> Why couldn't they be cows<br> from that planet?<br> Right!<br> Do you understand what I'm saying?<br> So even if the cows are so evolved<br> to the point where they're smart enough<br> to build flying saucers,<br> the people on the planet<br> are probably so far past that<br> that they still look down at the cows.<br> Perhaps.<br> They're saying, "Look at the dumb cows<br> and their stupid UFOs."<br> Or "FO" to them,<br> because they know what it is.<br> - Yes, exactly.<br> - Hey. So... Here, okay.<br> Can I just say, about your family,<br> apropos of nothing?<br> I love them. They're awesome.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Yeah.<br> With one exception.<br> I get a weird vibe from... Marvin?<br> - Martin.<br> - Martin.<br> Yes, I feel like Martin is<br> maybe just a little bit of a big,<br> wet, flapping douchebag?<br> - Dude! That's my cousin!<br> - Just saying. JS.<br> - He's cool.<br> - Come on.<br> He's... Martin's just got a burr<br> up his butt lately, 'cause he's...<br> 'Cause there's this guy back home, Cal.<br> It's his best friend.<br> And up until about a month ago,<br> we were serious, so...<br> I guess it comes to a point where it's<br> gonna happen or it's not gonna happen.<br> Right, right.<br> And he or you did not want it<br> to happen, or...<br> He's like one of those guys who likes<br> his routine a lot, you know, so...<br> - So he didn't want...<br> - He didn't want to mess with that.<br> What... So, you mean, like... Marriage?<br> Like he didn't want to marry you?<br> - Can you believe that?<br> - No.<br> No, right?<br> What is his deal?<br> What the hell is wrong with Cal?<br> So, anyway, I told him that I thought<br> we should take a breather.<br> And now I'm realizing, with all the time<br> that we're spending apart,<br> how different we really are.<br> So, what about you, kind sir?<br> Do you have a girlfriend back home?<br> Miranda!<br> - Where the hell have you been?<br> - I've been here...<br> I've been stomping around<br> for 45 minutes looking for you.<br> Everybody up there in the suite<br> is passed-out drunk.<br> So?<br> So, nobody's looking after Peepaw.<br> I just caught him urinating<br> in the hallway.<br> Oh, shit!<br> You think that's funny, mister?<br> How about I have you go up there<br> and clean it up?<br> - Martin.<br> - Martin, relax.<br> Sorry.<br> We're gonna go deep-sea fishing<br> tomorrow. Do you wanna join us?<br> Now, hold up, all right? We can't just be<br> inviting anybody to come along.<br> Gotta talk to the captain.<br> There's weight capacity issues.<br> Point is moot.<br> I can't go anyway, so we're cool.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> I'll see you. Okay.<br> I smell something weird out here.<br> Smells like somebody's<br> been hitting the devil's lettuce.<br> Where have you been?<br> Hi! Hey!<br> Honey, I was downstairs.<br> Downstairs.<br> You left here seven hours ago, Eddie.<br> You said you were just going<br> to have dinner.<br> I did! I did. I was right down at the bar.<br> I had the chimichangas<br> and the chalupa sampler on the side.<br> Chimichangas don't take that long.<br> No, no, they were quick. The chalupas<br> were a little slow coming out.<br> But, honey, what happened was<br> I met this great older couple<br> who found out it was our honeymoon,<br> and so they offered to buy me a shot<br> and this other group a shot, and then<br> we all ended up having shots, and...<br> What other group?<br> This other group. Just these rednecks<br> who were down at the bar.<br> But cool rednecks, you know,<br> like Jimmy Carter types.<br> Eddie, that still doesn't explain<br> why you're coming in at 4:00 a.m.<br> when the bar closed at 2:00.<br> Honey, you said you wanted to sleep,<br> so I wanted to allow you to rest,<br> so I ended up just sitting on the beach<br> watching the waves all night.<br> You were on the beach all this time?<br> Yeah.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes. Honey.<br> - Eddie Bear.<br> - Honey.<br> I don't want you to be... Careful!<br> Okay.<br> I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean<br> to take it out on you. I just...<br> I've been so miserable.<br> You know, I have this sunburn.<br> I have a pill stuck up my nose.<br> I can't sleep.<br> Wait, what?<br> You got a pill stuck up your nose?<br> Yeah. I tried to take a Tylenol<br> for the pain, you know,<br> and these Mexican pills are so big<br> that I started choking,<br> and then it got stuck<br> in my stupid deviated septum.<br> Wow. Did you try to get it out?<br> These crappy tweezers don't work.<br> It's just stuck.<br> Honey. I'm gonna take care<br> of this, all right?<br> - Okay.<br> - I'm gonna get rid of your little...<br> Your little unwanted visitor up there.<br> Here, go this way.<br> - Okay.<br> - Good. Now tilt back.<br> Hey, this is like that game Operation.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> - You touched my nose!<br> - Yes, I did.<br> - Okay, you gotta hold still, though.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> Wow, that's big.<br> My face feels so swollen.<br> I should take the cream off, I think.<br> All right.<br> That feels so much better.<br> How do I look?<br> What, is it bad?<br> No. It's not that...<br> Oh, my God!<br> - Honey.<br> - It's awful!<br> Honey! It's not that bad! Babe!<br> Lila, come on!<br> Lila, they have our credit card.<br> We're liable for the damages.<br> Go away! This is all your fault!<br> How is it my fault?<br> You threw such a hissy fit<br> about your stupid sunblock<br> that I wanted to prove you wrong!<br> You won, okay? Are you happy now?<br> - Lila, that's crazy talk.<br> - I'm ugly!<br> Honey, it's just a sunburn!<br> Lila?<br> Lila, come on.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> How long are you gonna stay in there?<br> None of your business.<br> Now leave me alone, Edward.<br> Babe, come on, I gotta pee.<br> - So?<br> - Let me in.<br> Go pee somewhere else.<br> Why don't you go explore Mexico<br> or something?<br> Honey, I don't want to explore Mexico<br> without you. Come on.<br> Well, I wanna be alone.<br> Well, you gotta eat.<br> Wanna have some breakfast?<br> Slide the menu under the door.<br> - Hey, you!<br> - Hey!<br> Hey.<br> I thought you guys were going<br> on that fishing expedition.<br> We slept in.<br> Yeah, I'm out a $150 deposit,<br> thanks to you, Mr. Party Boy.<br> Well, I guess that's how y'all do it<br> in California, huh?<br> You just rock on with no consideration<br> for other people's plans, right?<br> All right, Martin,<br> stop being such a tightwad.<br> We all gonna chip in for the boat.<br> I'm not gonna chip in<br> for no goddamn boat.<br> - You gotta hear this one. You tell him.<br> - No, you. All right.<br> Earlier today we were walking on<br> the beach, having our morning coffee,<br> and we got to talking about last night.<br> Anyhow, Buzz was just saying how<br> much fun it was getting to know you.<br> - It's really been a pleasure.<br> - Oh, yeah. Me, too.<br> By the way, for his birthday this year,<br> we're gonna get Boo<br> a license plate that says "Byoo"!<br> Can you imagine that?<br> Christmas morning,<br> he's gonna open it up,<br> it's gonna say "Byoo"!<br> - No numbers. "Byoo"!<br> - "Byoo"!<br> That's great. He'll love that.<br> He'll love that.<br> But that's a big secret.<br> Mum's the word, okay?<br> Who am I gonna tell?<br> - Good to see you.<br> - Take it easy.<br> Eddie, what do you have there?<br> It looks like you're eating for two.<br> Oh, no, no. Yeah. No, no. I just...<br> I just wanted to load up on some carbs<br> this morning, so...<br> And eggs, too. Eggs and carbs,<br> and, you know, full-on...<br> Hey, here's something to do.<br> There's a double-decker bus running<br> tours out to a town called Miraflores.<br> It's the basil capital of Mexico.<br> Let me see that.<br> - Did you say "bagel capital"?<br> - No.<br> I've always wondered how they cultivate<br> and harvest basil. That'd be great.<br> - Me, too. Education. No, it's a herb.<br> - It's a herb. Italian herb.<br> She puts it on a lot of<br> the food she cooks.<br> Everything.<br> - Oh, everything. I love it. Pesto.<br> - It's delicious.<br> - Is it spicy?<br> - No, it's not spicy.<br> You can order a whole box of it.<br> Uncle Tito will take care<br> of everything. Okay.<br> Hey. Listen, Tito, I need you<br> to do me a big, big favor.<br> You don't even know what it is yet.<br> It is something nasty,<br> or you would be doing it yourself.<br> All right, fine.<br> Honey? Is that you?<br> Good. I'll open the door,<br> and you slide it in.<br> Thank you.<br> Thanks. Okay. A little bit of salsa.<br> Are you okay?<br> But he keeps nipping at me.<br> Lime!<br> Oh, my God.<br> Good.<br> Hello?<br> Hey, Mac! Listen, man,<br> I owe you, buddy. This place is like...<br> This is like my favorite place ever!<br> I told you you'd love it.<br> And the people, the people down here!<br> Oh, my God, I know. Aren't they great?<br> I'm seriously thinking<br> I should sell the store<br> and open up a place down here.<br> I mean, wouldn't that be incredible?<br> So, how's Lila?<br> - Oh, I'm sorry, your name's Joachim?<br> - Who?<br> Your wife. Lila.<br> She's not so good.<br> She got a little sunburned, so...<br> I've been hanging out<br> with this other girl.<br> Yeah.<br> Wait. What, are you serious?<br> Divorce lawyer?<br> What the hell are you talking about?<br> Do you get a buzz off it?<br> I'm telling you, the second we<br> got married it's like a switch flipped.<br> She's a nightmare, Mac.<br> Yeah, well, bitches be crazy, man.<br> You know that.<br> Tammy's always flipping switches.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You're always talking about<br> how happy you are with her.<br> Look, you wanna know the secret<br> to a happy marriage? Do what I do.<br> Plaster on a fake smile,<br> plow through the next half-century,<br> sit back, relax and wait<br> for the sweet embrace of death.<br> - Hey. Wow!<br> - What about my hips?<br> - And my butt?<br> - Great. I love it. Looks great.<br> Where is it?<br> - Come on back!<br> - Yes! I'm coming, Alfons!<br> So, this other girl. It doesn't bother her<br> that you're a newlywed?<br> No. I mean, I haven't exactly made it<br> clear to her yet, but I'm going to.<br> I just have to find<br> the right moment, you know?<br> Eddie. Eddie!<br> Hold on a second.<br> Eddie! Come on, there are sea lions<br> in the ocean!<br> Really? Okay, hang on!<br> She found sea lions now, come on!<br> Isn't that amazing? I gotta go!<br> Don't! Eddie, Eddie! Come home!<br> Come home! Come home, Eddie!<br> Wow.<br> Ashes to ashes, funk to funky<br> We know Major Tom's a junkie<br> Strung out in heaven's high<br> Hitting an all-time low<br> Wow, what a great day.<br> I had so much fun.<br> Here are your Mexican sombreros.<br> Look, the gang's back.<br> Basil sniffers.<br> Okay, let's hurry up.<br> We're supposed to meet everybody<br> on the veranda in 15 minutes, right?<br> Right, right. Okay, good.<br> Hey, Dad.<br> There's the guy from San Francisco<br> whose wife was murdered.<br> - Where?<br> - The guy right there.<br> Yeah, some crazy guy<br> hacked her up with an ice pick.<br> They caught the dude, though.<br> Some guy named Ronald.<br> Hey, baby!<br> Eddie Bear's home!<br> And boy, do I got a story for you.<br> Well, I hope so,<br> seeing that you've been gone all day.<br> Honey. Guess what happened?<br> I go downstairs to get your breakfast.<br> Who do I run into out of the clear blue?<br> - Who?<br> - Yvon Chouinard!<br> Who?<br> Yvon Chouinard,<br> big cheese at Patagonia.<br> - And?<br> - And?<br> Come on, honey,<br> Patagonia's like my biggest supplier.<br> I carry their entire line. You know that.<br> So, Yvon and his buddies<br> are going out golfing. Water?<br> - No.<br> - They ask me if I want to go.<br> So, what am I gonna do?<br> Say no? No. Right?<br> But you didn't bring your clubs.<br> I demoed a set! TaylorMade!<br> Sweet, too!<br> Added like 30 extra yards to my drives!<br> - Who were the buddies?<br> - Just a couple of guys.<br> This guy Lenny from Akron, insurance<br> guy. Kind of a stiff, but good golfer.<br> And the local Patagonia rep.<br> What was his name?<br> His name was Six-toe.<br> - Six-toe?<br> - Yeah, Six-toe.<br> Amputee.<br> Lost four toes scaling up Everest.<br> Did it without oxygen.<br> One of those guys.<br> By the way, amazingly, he showed me.<br> Retained the outer toes,<br> lost the middle stuff<br> but kept the balance points,<br> which are all you need.<br> In fact, he says<br> it gives him a better swing<br> because he swings<br> right through the ball,<br> less resistance. Fascinating guy.<br> Eddie, since when has golf<br> taken seven hours?<br> Yeah, well, we got behind<br> a Korean couple, so...<br> But I'll tell you, it actually worked<br> to my advantage,<br> because we got to talk shop,<br> and if things pan out<br> the way I think they might,<br> we could be talking about some<br> really sweet credit terms for the store.<br> Why didn't you call me?<br> I've been worried sick about you.<br> Honey, I did!<br> You get a mile outside of this place, it's<br> like trying to get reception on the moon!<br> What are you doing?<br> Are you going somewhere?<br> Lila, I just told you, I'm taking them<br> out to dinner in five minutes.<br> When did you say that?<br> Okay. First of all, these people...<br> Let me explain something to you.<br> These people, okay, they're primed.<br> This opportunity... Do you understand?<br> This is the head of an incredibly<br> important outerwear company.<br> International, okay?<br> They have taken the bait, and now<br> I just gotta gaff 'em, get 'em in the boat<br> and club 'em to death. Kill time, honey.<br> Kill time. I can't let the air out.<br> Then all the momentum I built up all day<br> just evaporates.<br> By the way, shouldn't take too long,<br> because they started dropping back<br> the shots about two hours ago.<br> So... Very interested<br> in anything anybody has to say.<br> So, you know, it's gonna be good.<br> All right. Well, hang on a sec.<br> Let me put on some makeup.<br> You're coming?<br> Of course I'm coming.<br> Yes! Good! Sweet!<br> I'll just call down and tell them<br> to make room for one more on the skiff.<br> On the skiff?<br> We're going out on this little 12-foot<br> Zodiac, inflatable job, twilight cruise.<br> No, Eddie, I can't go on a boat.<br> Oh, crap. That's right.<br> You sure?<br> Because really, honey, we're only going<br> a couple miles out past the breakwater.<br> Right to where the continental shelf<br> drops off? It's supposed to be amazing.<br> The guy said it's where they filmed<br> that movie, The Perfect Storm?<br> Honey, I'm sorry, I feel really bad,<br> but there's no way I'd last out there.<br> You know what? Screw it. Screw it!<br> What am I doing?<br> I'm on my honeymoon!<br> Thank you for getting my head straight.<br> - I'm gonna call and cancel. Right now.<br> - What about the credit terms?<br> All right. You know what? Fine. You win.<br> We do it your way.<br> I'll go, finish the deal quickly, come<br> back, take you out for a late dinner.<br> That sound good? All right?<br> - Okay.<br> - Good.<br> Also, there's some important stuff<br> I wanna talk to you about.<br> Oh, yeah? Like, good stuff or bad stuff?<br> Like, well, you know,<br> at first you might flinch,<br> but then, I think, in the long run,<br> great stuff.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay, good.<br> - Oh, honey?<br> - Yeah?<br> I'm sorry I swatted you away<br> this morning.<br> I didn't mean to hit you so hard.<br> Swatted me away?<br> You know, when you were<br> sitting outside the bathroom door<br> after you dropped off the food,<br> and you put my hand on your schlong?<br> You just surprised me, you know?<br> And I wasn't feeling so well.<br> But I promise<br> I'll make it up to you tonight.<br> Super.<br> - Hey there, Tito.<br> - Hey, Seor Eddie.<br> How's it going, man?<br> - I'm okay.<br> - Yeah? Sure?<br> 'Cause you look like you got<br> a little hitch in your giddyup.<br> Oh, that. No, it is a long story.<br> I will not bore you with it.<br> No, no, no. You bore me. Bore me.<br> Please. I got all the time in the world.<br> I'd love to hear. What happened?<br> Okay. After I dropped the food off<br> at your room this morning,<br> I placed my penis in your wife's hand<br> and she smacked it away.<br> She nailed me pretty good, too.<br> Are you for real?<br> What are you doing? You don't just...<br> You crossed a serious line there.<br> That's not acceptable.<br> You don't do that. Come on.<br> Screw off! You're joking, right?<br> You had me.<br> - No.<br> - That's good!<br> No, I'm not joking. That's outrageous!<br> That's not acceptable behavior.<br> You don't just go and take your penis<br> and put it in my wife's hand.<br> Well, when you put it that way...<br> Wow, I'm sorry. I feel really bad, okay?<br> What were you thinking?<br> It's just that, well...<br> You come down here and you try<br> to bribe me with your porno tapes,<br> and then I see you running around<br> with other women on your honeymoon,<br> and I just figured that,<br> "Anything goes with this guy, hey?"<br> All right, fine.<br> I am sorry<br> for the misunderstanding, seor!<br> - Hey!<br> - Hey!<br> Wow. You look beautiful.<br> Thanks.<br> - So, you gonna walk me over?<br> - Yeah. Yeah. Hey, listen.<br> I gotta tell you something.<br> And it's something I should have said<br> before, but I didn't, and...<br> I know about your wife.<br> You do?<br> How?<br> Beryl and everybody overheard some<br> people talking about it on the bus.<br> They were talking about it on the bus?<br> So it's true, then?<br> Yeah, but it's really important<br> for you to know that it is over.<br> And I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.<br> It's just...<br> You know,<br> at first it didn't even occur to me<br> because, you know,<br> when I first met you...<br> And then... I don't know, I didn't realize<br> I was gonna like you so much.<br> And I didn't wanna freak you out, so...<br> You wouldn't have freaked me out.<br> Really? So you're not mad?<br> No.<br> I'm sad.<br> That must have been horrible.<br> It was. It is. I mean, it sucks.<br> You're like the coolest person<br> on the planet.<br> Really.<br> No, I mean,<br> I wasn't expecting this reaction.<br> - So your whole family knows?<br> - Yeah.<br> I can't imagine they're taking it<br> as well as you are.<br> Of course they are.<br> - They just wanna support you.<br> - Even Martin?<br> Boo instructed everybody<br> not to even bring it up.<br> Dynamite!<br> The burros.<br> You go to the top of a mountain and<br> they leave you there with a pack of...<br> No, all the way up<br> to the top of the mountain,<br> and you can camp out there overnight.<br> - By starlight, you make a fire...<br> - We should do that.<br> - Totally. Totally in.<br> - I'm serious.<br> - Anytime.<br> - We could do it the day after tomorrow.<br> That would be... Okay, I have some<br> things that I have to move around.<br> It will be a bit of a headache,<br> but I can make it happen.<br> Buzz.<br> Am I the only one who's still<br> a little bothered by this guy?<br> I believe you are.<br> All right.<br> Well, let me ask you this, okay?<br> This dude's supposed to be<br> down here in mourning.<br> What's he doing<br> canoodling with Miranda?<br> - And the goat was dead?<br> - No, no.<br> - Really?<br> - The goat got back up.<br> Everybody mourns in their own way.<br> Why don't you cut him some slack?<br> He likes her and she likes him.<br> And I don't think<br> they're breaking any rules, all right?<br> I don't trust him.<br> Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> How you doing?<br> Honey, I'm sorry<br> for ruining our honeymoon.<br> I'm such a sucky wife.<br> No, honey, you're not.<br> You're great.<br> You're an amazing, beautiful person.<br> However, I do think we should talk.<br> Hold on. I have something for you.<br> I love that. Thank you.<br> So anyway, I've been thinking...<br> Honey, turn it over.<br> Did you make this?<br> Before we left.<br> You made this?<br> - You sewed this yourself?<br> - Yeah.<br> And the hearts?<br> Your heart and my heart,<br> together<br> forever.<br> So, honey, what did you<br> wanna talk to me about?<br> I want to talk to you<br> about nothing right now.<br> I want you to get some rest<br> and we'll talk in the morning, okay?<br> Give me a kiss.<br> Okay.<br> Eddie Bear, I love you.<br> I love, love, love, love, love...<br> Love, love, love.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> So, what's this important stuff<br> you wanted to talk to me about?<br> Yeah, okay.<br> Oh, my God!<br> This guac is fucking awesome!<br> Is it? That's good. Good.<br> Your hand, Eddie.<br> Look, I'm just gonna<br> lay this out there, all right?<br> I have not been a good husband.<br> I've been bad.<br> I am so glad to hear you say that, Eddie.<br> I mean, I thought I was losing my mind.<br> It's like the moment we got married,<br> a switch went off<br> and you became this loony bird.<br> Yes! Yes, you're right!<br> I did turn into... I've been a loony bird,<br> and it's not you, it's me.<br> This conversation<br> is all about my deficiencies,<br> because as a wife you've been spot-on.<br> You've been incredible.<br> You've been doing everything<br> a wife should do,<br> and any man would be happy<br> to have a wife like you,<br> and kudos to you for putting up with me<br> and all of my junk.<br> Thank you.<br> But the point is, honey, you shouldn't<br> have to put up with your husband.<br> You deserve so much better.<br> You understand what I'm saying?<br> Yeah, you're apologizing.<br> That's very sweet.<br> No. No, I'm not... I'm not...<br> Oh, God, that frigging stuff is hot.<br> Honey, look...<br> In life, sometimes...<br> Sometimes we make choices,<br> and in retrospect, we realize<br> the choice wasn't the right choice.<br> Not a bad choice, not a good choice,<br> just not the correct choice<br> for the people who are involved.<br> What are you getting at, Eddie?<br> Lila,<br> we're not gonna be happy together<br> in San Francisco.<br> Rotterdam! That's where you gotta be.<br> It hit me!<br> That's where your destiny is.<br> Cleaning up the bogs,<br> and getting the environment<br> right over there.<br> That's what you should be doing,<br> not hanging out in San Francisco<br> with me, some sporting-goods schmo...<br> Oh, my God!<br> Are you saying<br> what I think you're saying?<br> I'm saying...<br> Lila?<br> This is gonna be a good thing, Lila.<br> Lila, it's better. It's for the...<br> Lila, you got a little piece of tri-tip<br> coming out here.<br> This is so for the best. Do you hear me?<br> Can I call my mom?<br> Yes, of course!<br> You wanna call her, go ahead, call her.<br> - Hello?<br> - Mom, it's me.<br> No, no, I'm okay. It's just...<br> Something's happened.<br> Something huge.<br> Eddie's moving to Rotterdam with me.<br> No, no, wait! No, Lila, no.<br> He doesn't wanna be<br> a sporting-goods schmo anymore!<br> Hold on, he wants to tell you himself.<br> I didn't want... Hello?<br> Hey, Eddie! You having fun?<br> Yeah, yeah, we're having a ball.<br> And I hear you're moving to Germany?<br> No, no.<br> See, Lila got a little bit<br> ahead of herself on that one,<br> and I haven't actually gotten through<br> the entire plan with her, but she...<br> You know what? I gotta go.<br> I gotta say goodbye, okay?<br> - Okay. Yes.<br> - Love you! Bye!<br> - Hey!<br> - Isn't he the greatest?<br> What's that?<br> I know. I know.<br> - How you guys doing?<br> - Not too good, actually.<br> Beryl and Boo are set<br> to renew their vows on the terrace<br> and we can't find Miranda anywhere.<br> Have you seen her?<br> Hang on. Honey, who's Miranda?<br> Miranda, honey, is their cousin.<br> Their cousin.<br> You know what? Excuse me<br> for one second. Come here.<br> Sorry, Mom. Yeah, no. I don't know.<br> Just some guys.<br> Guys! Guys! What are you doing?<br> You're killing me here.<br> What is this? What's going on?<br> Look, Martin, I know you're upset<br> about this whole thing<br> with Cal, Miranda and me.<br> But there'll be a time and a place<br> we can talk about it, but not now.<br> I'm about to tell her.<br> Who is that?<br> It's my wife!<br> Wife?<br> Guys, what are you, like, snorting<br> peyote? Come on, it's me. It's Eddie.<br> - But your wife was murdered.<br> - What?<br> Those twins.<br> They said that your wife was murdered<br> by a maniac with an ice pick.<br> No, no, no, no, no.<br> Look, you guys, all you have to know<br> is that from the second<br> I fell in love with Miranda,<br> I have not once cheated on her<br> with my wife, okay?<br> And I'm not saying that<br> to toot my own horn, it's just...<br> - I really haven't...<br> - You sick little prick!<br> - Martin! Martin!<br> - Come here.<br> - No, stop!<br> - Here, take this.<br> Hey, what are you doing?<br> Get off me!<br> You gotta get yourself<br> right with God, buddy!<br> - He is not worth it!<br> - Get off me! Get off!<br> What is going on?<br> Eddie, who was that?<br> I have absolutely no idea.<br> How's your... How's your...<br> What do you mean, you have no idea?<br> They called you Eddie.<br> You knew their cousin!<br> No, I know. I mean, I know who<br> they were, they're the Patagonia guys.<br> I just didn't understand<br> why they were so...<br> You know, they get so...<br> Acting like that.<br> Eddie, are you okay?<br> No! I'm not okay!<br> Look, Lila, we're not okay. It's over!<br> No!<br> Could you please go away?<br> - What?<br> - We're over!<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Stop!<br> - What's over?<br> - Hang on a sec.<br> Here! Here you go. Fifty.<br> Fifty Americano. Please stop, okay?<br> Can you... No! No, stop!<br> Will you shut up?<br> We're trying to have lunch here!<br> Would you stop? I'm paying<br> a lot of money to stay at this hotel!<br> I'm on my honeymoon.<br> We just want to have a nice quiet lunch!<br> Eddie, Eddie. It's okay.<br> They're not bothering me.<br> No! It's not okay!<br> We're newlyweds! We just wanna have<br> a quiet time together!<br> How can we have any good memories<br> if you guys keep...<br> Eddie, Eddie.<br> It's okay, I am having good...<br> Eddie, please sit down!<br> Wow, I was starting to wonder<br> where all that passion had gone.<br> Lila, I'm sorry,<br> but you and I are finished.<br> What are you talking about, Eddie?<br> What about our Rotterdam plans?<br> I'm sorry. I'll be right back.<br> I'm sorry. I'll be right back.<br> Eddie!<br> You're acting like a loony bird again!<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> Oh, my God!<br> What happened to your nose?<br> - Martin stuck a pepper up it.<br> - What?<br> Look, there's been<br> a massive misunderstanding.<br> I don't mean to be rude, Eddie,<br> but can this wait?<br> No!<br> I'm gonna be late<br> for Beryl and Boo's ceremony.<br> Look, my wife was never murdered.<br> - What?<br> - Yeah, my wife, she never died.<br> In fact, I never actually said that,<br> it was just those stupid twins, they...<br> What are you saying?<br> You're not a widower?<br> - No...<br> - No, he's married!<br> Martin just told me.<br> He's been staying here with his wife<br> all week!<br> What is she talking about?<br> It's true, I'm...<br> But it's over, Miranda. I mean, it's...<br> Get away from me.<br> Miranda, it's okay.<br> Will you listen to me, please?<br> Get away from me. Leave me alone!<br> Miranda!<br> Hang on!<br> Eddie!<br> Shit!<br> - Eddie!<br> - I was trying to tell you before.<br> - Leave me alone! Get away from me!<br> - Miranda!<br> Eddie! What the hell is going on?<br> Lila, I was trying to tell you before,<br> and I...<br> Did I cut my back on the rocks?<br> Oh, my God!<br> Man-o'-war!<br> Get it off! Get it off!<br> Come on, do something.<br> I'm not doing anything.<br> This is what he gets.<br> - It's okay! I know what to do.<br> - What are you doing?<br> Get off of me! No! No!<br> Oh, my gosh!<br> I know what I'm doing!<br> - No!<br> - Eddie!<br> - Burning! Burning!<br> - It's okay!<br> It's okay. It's okay.<br> I know, honey. Isn't that nice?<br> Sick!<br> Oh, no! It's okay, I'm his wife.<br> - We're on our honeymoon!<br> - Honeymoon?<br> Miranda, it's not what it seems.<br> No. Wait, Miranda!<br> Miranda!<br> I think it was<br> a confluence of events, you know?<br> With my dad busting my balls<br> about my dating life,<br> then going to Jodi's wedding.<br> Why did I even go to Jodi's wedding,<br> you know? Just to torture myself?<br> Mac's all up in my grill about being<br> married. It's just...<br> I don't know, I jumped,<br> you know, I jumped.<br> I felt the heat and I jumped, and it was<br> like two days, three days early.<br> And I'll tell you something.<br> I should've just gone with my dad to<br> Vegas and double-teamed those girls.<br> That would've been<br> the decent thing to do.<br> Seor Eddie!<br> Hey, there he is! Seor Tito!<br> My Tito-Bandito!<br> Eddie, what are you doing?<br> I'm just hanging with my brother,<br> my brother Manuel.<br> Eddie, people are looking for you.<br> Your father keeps calling, and then Mac<br> is trying to track you down.<br> And what am I supposed to tell<br> the American girl, the... Miranda?<br> - What do I tell her?<br> - Miranda?<br> - Miranda?<br> - Yes!<br> - What?<br> - Her family flew home, but she didn't.<br> And she has been everywhere<br> searching for you.<br> She has?<br> Screw off! I'm joking, man!<br> That chick ran for the hills, huh?<br> You should've seen your face!<br> You were so happy!<br> For a moment, you were like...<br> I can't believe I got you again!<br> The funny man!<br> That's cool man, that's cool.<br> Don't worry about me.<br> Seriously, are you here for a reason?<br> Huh? What's the deal?<br> What, you want me to... You want<br> to tell me to, like, go back and get Lila?<br> Or go back to the States?<br> It's not gonna happen!<br> Look at you. Listen to you.<br> You are sounding loco!<br> - Oh, I'm loco?<br> - Yes.<br> No, you're loco!<br> Lila burned my wallet, she burned<br> my clothes, she burned my passport.<br> Okay? Even if I wanted<br> to go back, I couldn't!<br> I can't get papers<br> for like a month or something.<br> But you know what? I don't need papers<br> to hang with this guy,<br> 'cause he doesn't want papers.<br> He just wants friendship, don't you?<br> And we're gonna stay here,<br> we're gonna keep talking it out<br> and talking it out,<br> until it feels right up in my head.<br> Right, Manny?<br> Even if it takes forever. Am I right?<br> Listen, you little gringo pussy,<br> you've been ear-fucking me for<br> two straight weeks about all this shit!<br> You wanna fix what you did?<br> Stop talking about it, just do it!<br> Get off your ass and do it!<br> Manuel is right, Seor Eddie.<br> You are going to have to go back and<br> fix this yourself, okay? Now, come on.<br> - Get up!<br> - Can't.<br> You can do it, come on! Listen.<br> I have connections. You know, people<br> that can sneak you back into California.<br> You're not joking?<br> No, I promise. I'm not kidding this time.<br> - Okay, good. Good, good.<br> - Yes!<br> But I don't wanna go to California.<br> I wanna go to Mississippi.<br> It's cool! It's cool, guys!<br> I'm an American. I just lost my passport.<br> America!<br> Stop right there!<br> I'm an American!<br> - Come on, grab his hand!<br> - You can do it!<br> Come on, buddy!<br> Come on! Grab it!<br> I'm going on the record here, Eddie.<br> I think this is a bad, bad idea.<br> Look, Pop, I appreciate your coming<br> down here and helping me out.<br> This is just something<br> that I have to do, okay?<br> I still don't understand<br> what happened with you and Lila.<br> She was such a sweet kid.<br> Dad, I love Miranda, okay?<br> I've never been more sure<br> of anything in my life.<br> All right, Eddie. Just be careful, okay?<br> Remember, this is the Bible Belt.<br> These people have guns.<br> This is it, right here! Stop! Stop!<br> Don't you think we should clean you up<br> or give you a shave or something?<br> No. Look. I've been working on<br> this speech for over a month.<br> I just want to go in and do it.<br> Knock 'em dead!<br> Seven pitches in a row over 90 miles<br> an hour? That boy hums that ball!<br> Byoo! Look what the cat dragged in!<br> I know, don't ask. Is Miranda around?<br> - You must be out of your mind.<br> - Well, no, I'm not.<br> Oh, my God! Why am I not surprised<br> that this moron's standing out here?<br> It's all right.<br> Look, I don't want any trouble, Martin.<br> Oh, you don't want any trouble?<br> You're about to get some trouble, boy!<br> You better get off my stoop!<br> You piece of shit!<br> That is a refreshingly honest response.<br> And let me just drop some of that<br> back on you,<br> and tell you I made<br> a huge mistake, okay? Guilty. Boom.<br> I stepped in it, big-time.<br> And I admit it, okay?<br> I jumped into a marriage<br> way too quickly.<br> I only knew my wife for a couple months<br> before we got married, okay?<br> So that's the back story.<br> And how long did you know Miranda<br> before you decided she was the one?<br> Two days, and I hear that.<br> Let me just say to you,<br> "That's my point."<br> I'm not gonna make<br> the same mistake again, okay?<br> You can rest assured,<br> I have got my act together.<br> And once my annulment is finalized,<br> I really believe that Miranda<br> and I should just go slow.<br> I mean, you know, date for a while.<br> Move in together for like a year, at least.<br> See what it feels like,<br> then go from there, okay? No promises.<br> - Really?<br> - I wanna do everything right this time.<br> There ain't gonna be a "this time,"<br> Eddie. The popcorn has popped.<br> Miranda and Cal got married<br> two weeks ago Saturday.<br> What?<br> What're you talking about?<br> She has finally come to her senses.<br> I don't believe you.<br> - Oh, you better believe it.<br> - Eddie...<br> - I don't believe you.<br> - Eddie...<br> It's true.<br> They got married?<br> Well, can I...<br> At least, can I talk to her in person...<br> - No, you cannot, all right?<br> - Martin! Martin! Calm down!<br> You will stay the hell away<br> from Miranda, okay?<br> I'm gonna put my fist through your face!<br> I'll put both of my fists<br> through your face!<br> I'm calm! I'm calm! I'm being calm.<br> You're holding me too tight!<br> Stop it. Eddie...<br> - Take it easy, boy.<br> - I'm fine.<br> Now, look, we ask you to respect<br> Miranda and Cal's privacy.<br> Give those kids a chance to be happy.<br> If you care about Miranda,<br> that's what you'll do.<br> Okay, Beryl.<br> I will.<br> Miranda!<br> It's okay!<br> It's me. It's just Eddie.<br> Are you crazy?<br> This is crazy!<br> Hi!<br> - What the hell are you doing here?<br> - It's okay, it's okay.<br> Beryl told me you got married.<br> I just wanted to talk to you.<br> This is my husband sleeping<br> right next to me. Do you see that?<br> Yes, I do.<br> This is not the time or the place<br> to do this!<br> Please, please. Look, I'll keep it quiet.<br> I'll be cool. Just hear me out.<br> No! I am not going to hear you out!<br> This is insane!<br> I'm begging you! You don't know<br> what I've been through to get here.<br> Please, just hear me out.<br> You got one minute. Go.<br> Okay, look. First of all, I'm so sorry<br> I didn't tell you I was married.<br> See, I tried to tell you a couple of times,<br> but we kept on getting interrupted.<br> And then there was this sort of<br> classic misunderstanding<br> about my wife being murdered.<br> Anyway, the point is...<br> No! The point is,<br> whether you tried to tell me or not,<br> you tried to pick me up<br> on your honeymoon!<br> Do you know how creepy that is?<br> Yes, I do. I do. It's repulsive,<br> and I owe you a massive apology.<br> But, on the other hand,<br> I'm glad it happened.<br> Look, it's not my fault the Lord works<br> in mysterious ways.<br> And so, yeah, I screwed up, okay?<br> I got married a week too early.<br> But you know what?<br> I wouldn't change any of it.<br> I don't regret marrying Lila<br> because if I hadn't,<br> then I wouldn't have gone to Cabo,<br> and I wouldn't have met you, and<br> I wouldn't have fallen in love with you,<br> and I will never apologize for that.<br> Not ever.<br> God damn it, Eddie.<br> I know.<br> Cal, it's fine.<br> Martin! Martin, put the bat down.<br> Just shush, all right?<br> This ain't about you, it's about him!<br> What?<br> Who the hell is that guy?<br> This the psychopath who's trying<br> to steal your woman, man!<br> I knew you wouldn't stay away from her,<br> you son of a bitch!<br> I can't help it.<br> The heart wants what it wants.<br> Eddie, you've gotta get out of here!<br> Not until you give me an answer.<br> No! There ain't gonna be no answer!<br> Damn you, Martin!<br> Damn, that hurts! Shit!<br> You... Martin, that hurts!<br> You wanna throw down, tough guy?<br> I will mess your shit up! Come on.<br> I don't want any trouble here.<br> Why don't you just back up, all right?<br> Well, trouble's found you, pussydick!<br> Dad! It's okay.<br> Look, Miranda, just tell me,<br> do you feel the same way, or not?<br> We can figure everything else out.<br> No, I don't, Eddie.<br> We had a connection in Mexico,<br> and that's all it was.<br> I love Cal, and everything that happened<br> in Cabo made me realize that.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's the deal.<br> Come on, kid, let's get out of here.<br> Come on, come on.<br> Come on.<br> Bitches be crazy, you know that.<br> Come on.<br> Yeah, take care, Grandpa.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Wow.<br> Hey, Dad?<br> Take a look.<br> If she's watching,<br> it means I still have a shot.<br> Your goose is cooked, Eddie.<br> Come on, man. You can't leave me now.<br> I finally straightened Tammy out.<br> What does that mean?<br> It means I stood up to her.<br> I told her that from now on,<br> Thursday through Sunday,<br> it's gonna be bros before hos.<br> I said, "I's needs my's alone time."<br> Really? You said that? Just like that?<br> Putting your hand up, like...<br> Like, half that, yeah.<br> And she bought that?<br> Honey, I'm conversing<br> with Edward right now.<br> I'll speak to you later.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Wow. Impressive.<br> - Yeah, see?<br> That's how it's gonna be from now on.<br> Please don't go.<br> Mac, we've been through this before.<br> There's no reason for me<br> to be here, okay?<br> Lila got the store in the divorce.<br> My dad's off in Vegas all the time.<br> I haven't really met anybody<br> in the last six months.<br> That's because you're still<br> hung up on that Miranda chick.<br> No, I'm not! I'm over her. I moved on.<br> In fact, I'm starting to think<br> there's a lot of good<br> that came out of that experience.<br> - Oh, really?<br> - Yeah!<br> Like, you got to sit around<br> for six months in your panties,<br> growing that funky beard.<br> That was awesome.<br> Yeah, which is why I need to change.<br> I can't just sit around<br> waiting for life to happen to me.<br> I need to follow my instincts,<br> and right now my instincts<br> are telling me that I...<br> Mac, get your ass<br> in the fucking car right now!<br> You got it, sweetie. Hi.<br> Eddie! Think about what I said.<br> Bros before hos!<br> How you doing, Eddie? You sad?<br> - No.<br> - Good.<br> Good. Okay.<br> Okay. Bye, Lester.<br> Now, for another $150,<br> I can give you the Uncle Tito special.<br> A guided tour to the island's best reef!<br> - $150?<br> - That's a little steep, isn't it?<br> Or you can find it yourself.<br> You guys are pretty big.<br> I don't think you're gonna have<br> a problem fending off the sharks.<br> Tito! Don't scare these people.<br> There's no sharks.<br> There's sand sharks,<br> but they don't have any teeth.<br> You see that attitude right there?<br> You have no business sense.<br> Hey, Manuelito! Do me a favor.<br> Help Tito give these folks<br> some snorkel gear, all right?<br> Throw in the fins for free.<br> - Oh, hey. Thanks, Eddie.<br> - Thanks again, Eddie.<br> How much for a skimboard?<br> Hey! Hi!<br> Hi.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Down here with the family.<br> It's that time of year again.<br> Beryl and Boo are renewing their vows<br> on the beach this afternoon, so...<br> Wow!<br> And, to be honest,<br> I had heard a rumor that<br> you'd opened a business down here.<br> Oh, yeah? How'd you hear that?<br> I got the e-vite for your grand opening.<br> Oh, right.<br> Yeah, I had a group e-mail list that I...<br> I can't believe you really moved here.<br> Yeah, I did it.<br> I became one of those<br> perma-vacationers,<br> like we talked about.<br> - Yeah, I remember.<br> - Yeah.<br> Suits you.<br> You look beautiful.<br> Thanks.<br> So, you down here with Cal<br> and the crew and...<br> Cal and I split up.<br> Split up.<br> He's a great guy, but we probably<br> should've never gotten married.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I guess now I know what you<br> went through on your honeymoon.<br> It's not easy being married when<br> you're in love with someone else.<br> He's in the car,<br> and I am dying for you to meet him!<br> He's...<br> Really? He's in the car?<br> No! No.<br> Funny.<br> Got me. That was... That's good.<br> - Very funny.<br> - Thank you.<br> - So, you are single. You're single?<br> - I am.<br> I'm actually staying at the hotel, if you<br> wanna grab a drink or something.<br> I would love that.<br> How about tonight, 7:00?<br> I could do that.<br> - Cool.<br> - Great.<br> Miranda!<br> Come on, we're gonna miss<br> the ceremony!<br> - I'm coming!<br> - Hey, Martin!<br> Hello, asshole!<br> Great to see you, too!<br> So, I'll see you tonight.<br> Yeah, I'll see you tonight.<br> Eddie?<br> Who was that?<br> Oh, hey! Yeah, it's unbelievable.<br> That was Gretchen Construbias.<br> Who?<br> Gretchen Construbias,<br> the CEO of Da Huey?<br> Da Huey Water Wear Sports.<br> They're, like, my biggest supplier. Yeah.<br> Yeah, anyway, she's in town<br> for one night.<br> She wants to get together and have<br> drinks at 7:00 to discuss credit terms.<br> - Tonight?<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, but, honey, it's our first anniversary.<br> I know, I know.<br> But, Consuela, I'll be back by 9:00, so...<br> - Oh, okay. So we have a late dinner?<br> - Okay.<br> Yes, perfect.<br> Late dinner, and that'll be good,<br> because there's some stuff<br> that I think we should discuss.<br> Oh. Good stuff or bad stuff?<br> Well, I think at first you might flinch,<br> but in the long run, great stuff.<br> I love you, Eddie.<br> Love, love, love, love, love.<br> Fuck me.<br> Cock me! Cock me!<br> Yes, yes!<br> Finally!<br> Yes, you're doing it!<br>
