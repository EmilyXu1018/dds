                        - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Here's the dress for Miss Sloper.<br> - Thank you.<br> Miss Cathy, it's your new dress!<br> Will you take it out of the box,<br> Maria, and hang it up?<br> Yes, Miss.<br> Well, that's all, I think.<br> - I'll be at the Harrisons'.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> I may not get to the clinic today<br> at all.<br> - Good morning, Lavinia.<br> - Good morning, Austin.<br> - Catherine's starting another?<br> - She embroiders beautifully.<br> I hope she doesn't let it become<br> a life's work.<br> Austin, yesterday<br> I had the most exciting experience!<br> - Oh?<br> - I met two people from Poughkeepsie.<br> Birth certificate. They had been<br> members of my husband's congregation.<br> When I told them I was stopping<br> with my brother,<br> Dr. Sloper, 16 Washington Square,<br> they were so impressed.<br> It's just made my visit!<br> Lavinia, would you care<br> to spend the winter here?<br> The winter? Oh, gladly!<br> Good. I thought if you stayed on,<br> you might help Catherine.<br> Help her? But help her how, Austin?<br> For instance,<br> Elizabeth's party this evening,<br> you could persuade Catherine<br> to join in with the young people.<br> Enjoy herself.<br> - But of course she'll do that.<br> - I hope so.<br> Ah.<br> Six pounds. That'll be 30 cents.<br> - Could you please cut off the head?<br> - Yes, Miss. Kitty, kitty, kitty.<br> - There you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> Yes, ma'am. Fresh fish!<br> - Morning, Father.<br> - Morning, Catherine.<br> I bought a fine fish<br> for the chowder you like.<br> That's very thoughtful.<br> Next time,<br> let the man carry it in for you.<br> - Oh. Yes, Father.<br> - Coming!<br> It's a lovely morning. Why don't you<br> invite your Aunt Lavinia or a friend<br> to take luncheon with you,<br> perhaps go to a park concert?<br> I can't. I have some embroidery<br> I'd like to attend to.<br> Ah, yes.<br> Well, I'll see you this evening.<br> Yes, Father. Goodbye.<br> - Catherine?<br> - Come in, Aunt Penniman.<br> Ooh, you must hurry, dear.<br> You were a long time<br> at that hospital committee.<br> - Too long.<br> - Didn't you like it?<br> Some ladies on the committee<br> are so foolish, they're useless.<br> They think it ill-bred to know<br> anything about food or the kitchen.<br> Such airs and graces.<br> When I was young,<br> we took pride in our housewifery.<br> My, the meals I used to set before<br> the Reverend Penniman, rest his soul!<br> - Then, you have deceived me, Aunt.<br> - How so?<br> You led me to believe<br> that you and he lived on love alone.<br> A witticism like that would be<br> of interest to people this evening.<br> It's a very good way to get started.<br> What I mean is, don't go off<br> by yourself tonight, will you?<br> Stay with all of us<br> and enjoy the party.<br> You have been talking to Father.<br> Well, yes, dear. In a way I have.<br> - Your father...<br> - Father would like me to be composed<br> - and to join in the conversation.<br> - Yes.<br> - I can't, Aunt Lavinia.<br> - Perhaps you don't try sufficiently.<br> Oh, I do! I do!<br> I would do anything to please him.<br> There's nothing<br> that means more to me.<br> I have sat here in my room<br> and made notes of the things I should<br> say and how I should say them.<br> But when I am in company, it seems<br> that no one wants to listen to me.<br> Now, Catherine.<br> If you will stay by me this evening,<br> you will see that what I say is not<br> always of the greatest importance<br> but, dear,<br> that doesn't keep me from talking.<br> Yes, Aunt.<br> Now, I'll finish dressing<br> and meet you downstairs.<br> Father!<br> Come in, Catherine.<br> Good evening, Father.<br> Do I disturb you?<br> You are not a disturbing woman,<br> my dear.<br> Do you like my dress?<br> Is it possible this<br> magnificent person is my daughter?<br> But you are sumptuous, opulent.<br> You look as if<br> you have 80,000 a year.<br> - I thought you'd like the color.<br> - Yes.<br> - It's cherry red.<br> - So it is.<br> I believe my mother used to wear it.<br> In her hair ribbons, Austin.<br> Ah, yes.<br> But, Catherine, your mother was fair.<br> She dominated the color.<br> Well, I must dress.<br> I'll try not to keep you waiting.<br> Oh, I must pack our silver punch cups<br> for Aunt Elizabeth.<br> Is it proper for me to go<br> to Sister Elizabeth's party?<br> - Of course, why not?<br> - After all, I'm still in mourning.<br> Lavinia, I know you bear your sorrow<br> with equal fortitude,<br> whatever the surroundings.<br> That's right. After all, I'm just as<br> grief-stricken no matter where I am.<br> You were wonderful!<br> Your Aunt Penniman<br> has made a conquest.<br> Yes.<br> - Having a nice time, Catherine?<br> - Delightful, Aunt Elizabeth.<br> - So's Jefferson.<br> - Oh!<br> Austin, who's sick, who's dead?<br> Who've you been cutting up?<br> When your gout's troubling you,<br> you're more respectful to me.<br> - Are you making that announcement?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> - Go on! Go on!<br> - Alright! Alright!<br> If he doesn't do it now<br> he'll make it from under a table.<br> My good neighbors and dear friends,<br> I am about to lose the loveliest,<br> the most beautiful daughter...<br> ...very dearest girl,<br> to a most wonderful young man,<br> to Arthur Townsend.<br> I am at once<br> a sad and a very lucky father.<br> I'd like you all to toast my loss<br> and my gain.<br> - To the happy couple.<br> - To the happy couple.<br> Oh, Momma!<br> Don't look so happy. I'll be home<br> for all my meals. Uncle Austin.<br> Marian, my dear,<br> great happiness to both of you.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Cathy, isn't it wonderful?<br> Isn't this a lovely party?<br> Come along, Arthur, let's dance!<br> - Excuse us.<br> - Excuse us.<br> Oh, er, Quintus.<br> - You're not dancing?<br> - No, ma'am.<br> You remember Catherine Sloper,<br> my niece?<br> Yes, indeed.<br> May I have the pleasure, Catherine?<br> Thank you, Quintus.<br> Excuse me, Father.<br> - Permit me, Catherine.<br> - Oh, thank you, Father.<br> Do you suppose there's another Arthur<br> somewhere in this great city of ours?<br> - Catherine will find a husband.<br> - You think so?<br> She has the prospect<br> of 30,000 a year.<br> I see that you appreciate her.<br> I don't mean it's her only merit.<br> But you always allude to her<br> as an marriageable girl.<br> My allusions are as kind as yours,<br> Liz.<br> Do you suppose Jefferson<br> has left any French brandy?<br> Let's see.<br> May I get you some claret cup?<br> Oh, yes. Thank you.<br> She's gone to the best schools<br> in the city,<br> she's had the finest training<br> I could get her, music and dancing.<br> She's sat with me evenings on end.<br> I've tried to make conversation,<br> give her some social adeptness.<br> I've given her freedom wherever<br> I could. The result is what you see.<br> An entirely mediocre and defenseless<br> creature with not a shred of poise.<br> Austin, you're so intolerant.<br> You expect so much.<br> You remember her mother, Liz?<br> Her mother who had so much<br> grace and gaiety.<br> This is her child.<br> Austin, no child could compete with<br> this image you have of her mother.<br> You've idealized that poor dead woman<br> beyond all recognition.<br> You are not entitled to say that.<br> Only I know what I lost<br> when she died.<br> What I got in her place...<br> Catherine, what are you doing here?<br> I'm waiting for Quintus Seabury.<br> Well, don't wait here, dear.<br> Make him look for you.<br> Dancing was the one thing we<br> disagreed about, the Reverend and I.<br> Do you suppose<br> he's watching over me tonight?<br> That depends on where he is, Aunt.<br> - Good evening, Mrs. Penniman.<br> - Good evening.<br> Catherine, may I present<br> Mr. Morris Townsend?<br> How you doing, Miss Sloper?<br> Mr. Townsend's Arthur's cousin,<br> and he's just returned from Europe.<br> - How do you do, sir?<br> - Would you dance, Miss Sloper?<br> I believe she has a waltz left.<br> Excuse me, dear. There is Mr. Abeel.<br> May I?<br> Yes.<br> Which one will it be?<br> Oh! Yes...<br> Erm... the fifth?<br> The fifth? Thank you.<br> Two Rs in Morris...<br> Miss Sloper, I consider<br> that you're doing me a great honor.<br> You see, I'm rather choosy, too.<br> Catherine... Sloper.<br> Catherine Sloper.<br> Catherine Sloper, Catherine Sloper.<br> You know, we don't have to wait<br> until the fifth.<br> - No?<br> - No.<br> Miss Sloper,<br> we must make an arrangement.<br> I will not kick you<br> if you will not kick me.<br> Oh, dear! I'm so clumsy.<br> No, I'm wearing Arthur's boots<br> and he's a very bad dancer.<br> Oh!<br> Now, one, two, three, point.<br> One, two, three, point.<br> - Don't look at your feet.<br> - Where shall I look?<br> - Look at me.<br> - Oh.<br> No.<br> Very good.<br> When we were boys,<br> Arthur was called Porridge Head.<br> Shall we sit down?<br> While I've been in Europe,<br> he's become<br> a promising young businessman.<br> And now, Miss Sloper,<br> I think it's time you said something.<br> Erm...<br> Are you going to remain<br> in New York now, Mr. Townsend?<br> What a delightful question.<br> Well, I haven't been at all sure<br> what I was going to do.<br> But right now, I've decided.<br> Yes, Miss Sloper,<br> I am going to remain in New York now.<br> Are you warm?<br> - Let me get you some claret cup.<br> - Oh, no!<br> Are you a member<br> of the Temperance League?<br> - Er, yes, I believe I am.<br> - Oh.<br> Well, I'm not.<br> Will you excuse me for a moment?<br> Oh, Mr. Abeel,<br> I can't keep this up any longer!<br> I must rest.<br> Catherine, dear,<br> your old aunty is exhausted.<br> Finish this delightful polka, dear.<br> - Mr. Abeel is an accomplished dancer.<br> - Well, I...<br> It would be a pleasure,<br> Miss Sloper.<br> Mr. Townsend,<br> are you looking for my niece?<br> Yes. She must have been ambushed.<br> - Will you console me?<br> - She'll be back in a moment.<br> This is the sixth dance in a row.<br> Now, he just can't keep it up.<br> You know, I can dance most of these<br> young whippersnappers off their feet.<br> Lavinia.<br> Austin, may I present<br> Mr. Morris Townsend?<br> - Mr. Townsend, my brother, Dr. Sloper.<br> - I've looked forward to meeting you.<br> - I'm honored.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Have you had a nice time?<br> - I've had a most wonderful evening.<br> And we had difficulty persuading her<br> to come.<br> The gentlemen here all owe you<br> a vote of thanks, Doctor.<br> I'll be ready very soon.<br> Will you tell Catherine?<br> - It's the best part of the evening.<br> - It really is, Austin.<br> Ah, but you're used to those<br> gay nights at the parsonage.<br> I, alas, must be an early riser.<br> - Good night, Mr. Townsend.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> Oh, Catherine, I have bad news.<br> We're leaving.<br> Yes, Aunt.<br> - Where is Mr. Abeel?<br> - He's having a nosebleed.<br> Oh, dear!<br> - Good night, Mr. Townsend.<br> - Good night, Mrs. Penniman.<br> I wish to apologize, sir.<br> You should, Miss Sloper.<br> Had Mr. Abeel kept his health,<br> I should've invited him out<br> with sabers.<br> Well, I...<br> I must get my wrap.<br> - I, er, I've just met your father.<br> - Yes, I saw.<br> He left before I could ask him<br> when I might call.<br> His office hours are in the morning.<br> Are you not well, Mr. Townsend?<br> I'm in the best of health.<br> I wish to call on you.<br> Oh!<br> Oh.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Townsend.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Miss Sloper's not at home, sir.<br> - She isn't?<br> Why, Mr. Townsend!<br> - Good morning, Miss Penniman.<br> - Do come in.<br> I stopped by because Miss Sloper<br> told me she'd be home this morning.<br> - Is she really out?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> She has taken flight<br> at your third visit this week.<br> - I wonder why.<br> - Ooh, I cannot betray a confidence.<br> - You must ask her that.<br> - When?<br> Well...<br> - I know she won't be long.<br> - Thank you, ma'am.<br> The parsonage<br> was a veritable beehive<br> with our spelling matches,<br> taffy pulls.<br> Oh, and in the winter, the sleigh<br> rides over the Poughkeepsie hills...<br> Mrs. Penniman, do you suppose<br> Catherine, I mean, Miss Sloper...<br> - You may let yourself go with me.<br> - Yes, thank you, but...<br> - She will be home!<br> - Yes, but when?<br> Mr. Townsend, you remind me<br> so of the Reverend Penniman.<br> The same ardency,<br> the same passionate nature.<br> How I wish I might've known him.<br> Tell me about the doctor, ma'am.<br> What sort of...<br> - Oh, Catherine, is that you?<br> - Yes, Aunt.<br> - You have a visitor, young lady.<br> - Good morning.<br> It is a beautiful morning<br> for me now, Miss Sloper.<br> I was afraid you might not come back.<br> I would have to come back some time.<br> I live here.<br> I know you do, Miss Sloper.<br> That is why I'm here.<br> Mr. Townsend wondered if his flowers<br> had been delivered in good condition.<br> Yes, thank you. They were very fresh.<br> - I mailed you a note this morning.<br> - I shall treasure it, Miss Sloper.<br> Although I did not send the flowers<br> in order to be thanked.<br> - I sent them to give you pleasure.<br> - Thank you.<br> Oh, I brought that song<br> I told you I found in Paris.<br> Pardon me, ma'am, I'll get it.<br> - I will leave you alone.<br> - What will I talk about?<br> You will not have to do the talking.<br> He has come a-courting!<br> - Courting me?<br> - Well, certainly not me.<br> Now, you must be very gracious<br> to him!<br> Oh, Mr. Townsend, you must excuse me.<br> I have numerous duties which call me.<br> - I trust we shall see you again.<br> - I'm your servant, ma'am.<br> - You haven't forgotten this evening?<br> - No, Aunt.<br> Our girl is off to another one<br> of her endless parties.<br> It makes me very unhappy<br> to hear that.<br> Why?<br> That you're so sought after.<br> It makes my way harder.<br> I am not going to a party.<br> My father and I are dining<br> with Mr. And Mrs. Holme, that's all.<br> That's what I like you for.<br> You're so honest.<br> Tell me something.<br> Did you go out this morning<br> because you thought I might call?<br> Yes.<br> Do you not like to see me?<br> Yes, I like to see you, Mr. Townsend,<br> but you've called so frequently<br> this week...<br> - You're tired of me.<br> - Oh, no!<br> You consider my behavior improper.<br> I-I do not know.<br> I am puzzled.<br> Good. I like that.<br> If you're puzzled,<br> you're thinking of me.<br> - Is that the song?<br> - Yes.<br> - Will you play it for me?<br> - I do not play.<br> May I?<br> I assure you, I shan't harm it.<br> Can you hear me way over there?<br> You know, on my tenth visit,<br> you might even sit here.<br> Mr. Townsend, you are very bold.<br> - Do you know what it means?<br> - No.<br> The joys... of love...<br> ...they last... but a short time.<br> The pains... of love...<br> last all your life.<br> All... your life.<br> It's a lovely song.<br> You know,<br> I think of you constantly.<br> I'm not very good<br> at this kind of conversation.<br> Neither am I.<br> I'm afraid that is our trouble.<br> I am not a glib man, Miss Sloper.<br> I think you talk very well.<br> Not when I need it most.<br> Oh, with Miss Penniman,<br> or in my room at home<br> I can think of the most delightful<br> things to say.<br> - Can you understand that?<br> - Yes, I can.<br> But here with you,<br> I sound like a fool.<br> I don't think so.<br> You don't?<br> Well, if ever you do think so,<br> if ever I sound high-blown or false,<br> put it down to that, will you?<br> - I will try.<br> - And... take pity on my situation.<br> What situation?<br> Miss Sloper...<br> ...I have fallen in love with you.<br> You have?<br> - Ah, Catherine. Are you receiving?<br> - Yes, Father. I have a visitor.<br> Morning, my dear.<br> How do you do, Mr. Townsend?<br> - Morning, Dr. Sloper.<br> - Is your cousin here with you?<br> No. I'm on my own.<br> - I hope you don't mind.<br> - Delighted.<br> I have taken the liberty of calling<br> on a most attractive young lady.<br> - And her attractive father.<br> - Oh, we're not that attractive!<br> I'd like my sherry and biscuits.<br> Perhaps Mr. Townsend<br> might enjoy some with me.<br> I'd be honored.<br> Hmm. That's an excellent bay rum<br> you're using, Mr. Townsend.<br> I brought it with me from France.<br> Permit me to share it with you.<br> Thank you. Very kind.<br> But I can hardly let you do that.<br> Well, have you been out this morning,<br> my dear?<br> - Catherine?<br> - Oh!<br> Yes. I stopped by to see Mr. Rutini<br> after breakfast.<br> Oh, yes, about the lessons.<br> What did he say?<br> You need a very true ear<br> for the harp.<br> It seems that I<br> have not a very true ear.<br> Nonsense.<br> Your mother's ear was impeccable.<br> Yes, Father, I know.<br> She used to tune her own piano.<br> Miss Sloper has a great appreciation<br> for music.<br> That is a talent in itself.<br> Ah.<br> - Is cook's knee any better, Maria?<br> - It is a little easier, Doctor.<br> I'll be up to see her in a while.<br> Here. Give that to Mr. Townsend.<br> You're very kind, sir.<br> Most great doctors are too busy to<br> see the illness under their noses.<br> You're full of flattering<br> observations,<br> both for Catherine and myself.<br> That is the way you both strike me.<br> I told Miss Sloper, I'm very candid.<br> Oh, yes, he is. Very candid.<br> How long do you plan to remain<br> in our city, Mr. Townsend?<br> Oh, my stay is quite indefinite, sir.<br> Will you dine with us<br> one evening this week?<br> - I should be delighted.<br> - Shall we say Thursday, at six?<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Ah!<br> I was there quite a while.<br> Not as long as I should've liked.<br> - I think you'll find Paris changed.<br> - I hope not.<br> I should like it to be<br> exactly as it was.<br> Dr. Sloper went there<br> on his wedding trip.<br> In that case, Paris can never change<br> for you, Doctor.<br> How do you keep busy since your<br> return to New York, Mr. Townsend?<br> I'm looking for a position.<br> Your studies abroad<br> should open many avenues to you.<br> If I'd engaged in those studies,<br> Miss Penniman.<br> I was merely idling.<br> You see, I had a small inheritance<br> and... that was how I used it up.<br> What sort of position<br> should you prefer?<br> What am I fit for?<br> Very little, I'm afraid.<br> I have nothing but my good right arm,<br> as they say in the melodramas.<br> You're too modest. In addition to<br> that arm you have a very good mind.<br> I know from what I see<br> that you are extremely intelligent.<br> Oh, yes!<br> Thank you very much.<br> You advise me, then, not to despair?<br> I should be very sorry to admit<br> that a robust,<br> well-disposed man need ever despair.<br> If he doesn't succeed in one thing<br> he can try another.<br> Only,<br> he should choose with discretion.<br> Oh, yes. With discretion.<br> Were you kindly intending to propose<br> something for my advantage?<br> No. I've no particular proposal<br> to make.<br> But I hear the west is opening up.<br> Many young men are turning their eyes<br> in that direction.<br> I'm afraid I shouldn't be able<br> to manage that.<br> You see, I have ties here. My sister.<br> Oh, yes. Mrs. Montgomery, Austin.<br> Liz knows her.<br> They met at a charity bazaar.<br> She's widowed. Now that I'm back,<br> I'm staying with her.<br> - She's very dependent on me.<br> - Naturally.<br> Er, Mr. Townsend has<br> five little nephews and nieces.<br> He is helping to bring them up.<br> Yes, I give them lessons.<br> I'm a kind of tutor.<br> That's very proper.<br> Family feeling is very proper.<br> - But it's hardly a career.<br> - No. It won't make my fortune.<br> Ah. You mustn't be too much bent<br> on a fortune.<br> I'd looked forward<br> to an evening at home,<br> but the hospital commission<br> is session and I am to address them.<br> I understand, sir.<br> - Lavinia, I hope you'll excuse me.<br> - Of course.<br> Catherine, you will extend the<br> honors of the house to Mr. Townsend.<br> I'm very grateful for your interest,<br> sir.<br> Yes. Yes, indeed.<br> He doesn't like me.<br> - He doesn't like me at all.<br> - I don't see how you know.<br> - I feel. I'm very quick to feel.<br> - Perhaps you are mistaken.<br> You ask him and you'll see.<br> - Then, I would rather not ask him.<br> - Right.<br> - But you wouldn't contradict him.<br> - I'd never contradict him.<br> Austin,<br> isn't he a charming young man?<br> I never dreamed<br> he'd be so interested in Catherine.<br> - Nor did I.<br> - He's so agreeable. So elegant.<br> He may find it hard to maintain<br> elegance without working for it.<br> But he's looking for a position<br> earnestly.<br> I wonder if he's looking for it here,<br> Lavinia.<br> Wouldn't being husband to a<br> defenseless girl with a large fortune<br> suit him to perfection?<br> - How can you entertain suspicion?<br> - Suspicion? It's a diagnosis, dear.<br> You're not in your clinic now. Morris<br> would be a feather in any girl's cap.<br> You've only to use your eyes,<br> which are as good as mine.<br> Better.<br> Austin, you must help this along<br> and be thankful that it's come about.<br> Very well. When I'm being thankful,<br> I hope you will not forget<br> your duties as chaperone.<br> - Good night, my dear.<br> - Good night, Austin.<br> Have you any spirit of camphor?<br> I have one of my headaches.<br> - Headaches?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> They strike like a thief<br> in the night.<br> - Permit me to retire.<br> - Of course.<br> - Aunt!<br> - It's not like me to give in, dear,<br> but sometimes fortitude is folly.<br> Good night, dear.<br> - Good night, Mr. Townsend.<br> - Good night.<br> Poor Mrs. Penniman.<br> May I offer you your port<br> in the drawing room?<br> You see...<br> Yes?<br> Your Aunt, she's on my side. She<br> wouldn't let your father abuse me.<br> My father won't abuse you.<br> He doesn't know you well enough.<br> You know...<br> I would've liked you to say to me,<br> "My father doesn't think well of you,<br> what does it matter?"<br> But it would matter.<br> I could never say that.<br> We could do anything<br> for the one we love.<br> My dearest girl...<br> You must believe<br> how much I care for you.<br> You're everything<br> I've ever yearned for in a woman.<br> But I am...<br> I am so...<br> Oh, Catherine...<br> - Will you marry me?<br> - Yes.<br> You make me very happy.<br> - Do you love me?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, Catherine...<br> I... love... you.<br> I'll cherish you forever.<br> Oh! We must speak to my father.<br> I will do it tonight.<br> You must do it tomorrow.<br> It's sweet of you<br> to want to do it first.<br> A young man generally does that.<br> Oh! Women have more tact.<br> They can persuade better.<br> You'll need all your powers<br> of persuasion.<br> Naturally, your father wants<br> a brilliant marriage for you.<br> - I'm a poor man.<br> - My father will not care about that.<br> He might.<br> He might fear that I am mercenary.<br> Mercenary? Oh, no!<br> He may say it.<br> Well, I shall simply say it isn't so.<br> You must make a great point of that,<br> Catherine.<br> Why?<br> Because it's from the fact<br> of your having money<br> that our difficulties may come.<br> Oh, Morris!<br> Are you very sure you love me?<br> Oh, my own dearest...<br> ...do you doubt it?<br> Catherine.<br> Since your aunt has left us alone,<br> it's not proper<br> that I stay any longer.<br> Yes, Morris.<br> I'll be back in the morning<br> to call on your father.<br> - At what time?<br> - At 11:00 sharp.<br> I will tell him.<br> Please, Morris, promise me this.<br> When you speak with Father, you will<br> be very gentle, very respectful.<br> Of course. There's something<br> you must promise me.<br> If your father's against me, you will<br> be faithful no matter what comes.<br> Yes, Morris, no matter what comes.<br> You know, you're your own mistress.<br> You're of age.<br> Oh, I love you.<br> - I've always loved you.<br> - My dear girl!<br> - Oh, Father!<br> - Have you waited up for me?<br> - Yes, I have something to tell you.<br> - Have you?<br> - Yes!<br> - Well...<br> Let us go into the back parlor<br> and hear it.<br> Now, my dear, do you suppose<br> that we might both sit down?<br> - Well, now...<br> - I'm engaged to be married.<br> You do right to tell me.<br> And whom have you honored<br> with your choice?<br> Mr. Morris Townsend.<br> - You have gone fast.<br> - Yes, I think we have.<br> Mr. Townsend ought to have waited<br> and told me.<br> He means to tell you<br> tomorrow morning at 11:00.<br> It's not quite the same thing,<br> my dear.<br> You shouldn't be pleading for him.<br> He should plead for you.<br> Yes, Father, but I think<br> he is a little afraid of you.<br> - Is he?<br> - He fears that you do not like him.<br> Well, I hardly know him, Catherine.<br> But our liking each other<br> isn't important.<br> The only thing that is important<br> is that he loves you.<br> He does. He loves me and I love him.<br> It is a great wonder to me<br> that Morris has come into my life.<br> Oh, Father, don't you think he is the<br> most beautiful man you've ever seen?<br> Well, he's very good-looking,<br> my dear.<br> You wouldn't let a consideration<br> like that sway you unduly.<br> Oh, no! But that is what<br> is so wonderful to me,<br> that he should have everything,<br> everything a woman could want,<br> and he wants me.<br> - I'll see him tomorrow.<br> - I knew you would!<br> And you are so good that you will be<br> fair and honest with him.<br> I shall be as fair and honest<br> with him as he is with you.<br> Thank you, Father,<br> that is all we shall need.<br> Aunt Penniman.<br> Aunt Penniman.<br> - Oh, Catherine.<br> - He proposed to me.<br> Does your father know?<br> - Yes.<br> - What did he say?<br> - He will see Morris in the morning.<br> - Eureka!<br> - How is your headache now, Aunt?<br> - Headache?<br> Shhh!<br> Good morning, my dear.<br> This is my brother, Dr. Sloper,<br> Mrs. Montgomery.<br> Mrs. Montgomery<br> has been good to come.<br> - I'm very grateful to you, ma'am.<br> - I'm glad to come.<br> - She left a busy household.<br> - I should have gone to you,<br> but this is my morning at the clinic.<br> I dared not take the time off.<br> Oh, I quite understand, Doctor.<br> - Elizabeth...<br> - Certainly. Excuse me.<br> - Certainly.<br> - I should like to see my sister.<br> Will you come into the study<br> where we may talk?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You understand my situation,<br> Mrs. Montgomery.<br> Your brother<br> wishes to marry my daughter.<br> So I want you to tell me<br> something about his character.<br> What sort of a gentleman is he?<br> Well, Doctor,<br> he's intelligent, charming.<br> - He's a wonderful companion.<br> - Yes, I know that.<br> But is he reliable?<br> Is he trustworthy? Is he responsible?<br> If you mean, is he financially<br> secure, he is not, Doctor.<br> - But I'm sure you must know that.<br> - Yes, he told me that himself.<br> That is another thing about Morris,<br> he's honest.<br> Is he? Is he, then, honest<br> in his feeling for my daughter?<br> I don't know that, Doctor.<br> I never could say what goes on<br> in people's hearts. Could you?<br> Well, I have to try.<br> He told me that he'd used up<br> a small inheritance.<br> - Did he handle it well?<br> - Probably you would not think so.<br> But from his own point of view,<br> he did a great deal with it.<br> He saw Europe.<br> He met many interesting people.<br> He enlarged his capacities.<br> - Did he help you, ma'am?<br> - No.<br> - Shouldn't he have?<br> - I don't think so.<br> You are a widow and have children.<br> I think so.<br> Oh, but if I'd needed it,<br> I know he would have helped me.<br> Are you sure?<br> You want me to complain about him,<br> sir, but I have no complaint.<br> I brought him up<br> as if he were my child<br> and I have accepted<br> the good and bad in him<br> just as I accept them in my children.<br> I have made you angry, madam.<br> I apologize.<br> I think, Doctor,<br> you expect too much of people.<br> If you do,<br> you'll always be disappointed.<br> I want you to meet my daughter.<br> - Would you excuse me?<br> - Certainly.<br> Catherine. Catherine.<br> Yes, Father.<br> Will you come into the study?<br> Yes, Father.<br> - Is this she?<br> - No, that is a picture of my wife.<br> - Oh, she's very beautiful.<br> - Yes, she was. Very beautiful.<br> Oh.<br> Catherine, this is Mrs. Montgomery,<br> Mr. Townsend's sister.<br> Miss Sloper.<br> - How do you do?<br> - I am very happy to meet you.<br> Thank you. Isn't Morris coming?<br> His appointment is for 11:00,<br> Catherine.<br> Oh, yes.<br> - Are your children well?<br> - Quite well, thank you.<br> I hope Morris will bring you<br> to see me and my family very soon.<br> Yes.<br> My brother tells me you have an aunt<br> visiting you, Miss Sloper.<br> Yes.<br> It is delightful to have someone<br> to whom one can show New York.<br> Oh, yes, it is.<br> Does she like our city?<br> Yes.<br> Catherine, perhaps you will offer<br> Mrs. Montgomery a glass of Madeira.<br> Oh, yes, indeed. Excuse me, ma'am.<br> - She... She is very shy.<br> - Yes, she is.<br> Perhaps she is less shy with Morris.<br> You said they've just fallen in love.<br> You were right about Catherine.<br> Were you right about your brother?<br> Well, I can only suppose<br> that Morris is more mature<br> in his feelings than I thought.<br> This time he has not sought out<br> superficial charms.<br> Perhaps he's considered<br> the gentle character underneath.<br> - Are you being honest?<br> - I think I am.<br> Well, I believe her money<br> is the prime attraction.<br> - What money?<br> - She's an heiress.<br> - Didn't your brother tell you that?<br> - No, he did not.<br> She has 10,000 a year<br> from her mother.<br> And, on my death,<br> she will have twice as much more.<br> - She... She will be immensely rich.<br> - Yes, she will, of course.<br> If she marries a man I don't approve,<br> I shall leave my part to the clinic.<br> - Yes, but she has the 10,000 now.<br> - Yes, she has.<br> That is still a great deal of money,<br> Doctor.<br> It is and consider<br> how he has behaved with money.<br> He gratified his every wish.<br> Did he help you with the children?<br> No!<br> He enlarged his capacities in Europe.<br> He left his gloves here last night,<br> the finest chamois. Look at yours.<br> Will he help you<br> with this fortune he hopes to marry?<br> I would stake my life he would not!<br> You must follow your own dictates,<br> Doctor.<br> Tell me she's not a victim of<br> his selfishness. Tell me I'm wrong.<br> I must go now.<br> - Good day, Doctor.<br> - Good day, ma'am.<br> Oh, has Mrs. Montgomery left?<br> I wanted Lavinia to meet her.<br> - Yes, Liz, she has left.<br> - Did you like her?<br> - Very much.<br> - Oh, good.<br> Catherine has just asked Elizabeth if<br> Marian might be her maid of honor.<br> Catherine is radiant.<br> I've never seen her this way before.<br> She must get over it.<br> He is worthless.<br> - What?<br> - The man's a fortune hunter.<br> All he's interested in is her money.<br> Are you going to tell that<br> to Catherine?<br> - No.<br> - But, Austin...<br> Catherine, Mrs. Montgomery has left.<br> Oh, I took too long. I wanted<br> to make the tray especially nice.<br> It was not your fault, my dear.<br> We have concluded our talk.<br> Concluded?<br> Did Mrs. Montgomery<br> tell you something bad, Father?<br> - No, Catherine.<br> - I did not impress her favorably.<br> Good heavens!<br> Don't hold yourself so cheaply.<br> I was embarrassed.<br> I won't be another time.<br> - You had better go to your room.<br> - Yes.<br> Father, tell him about me.<br> You know me so well.<br> It will not be immodest in you<br> to praise me a little.<br> How is it possible to protect<br> such a willing victim?<br> You will kill her<br> if you deny her this marriage.<br> You forget I'm a doctor.<br> People don't die of such things.<br> Be very careful, Austin.<br> He may take good care of Catherine<br> and her money and make her happy.<br> - He will. I know he will.<br> - But she's been taken in.<br> She's in love.<br> Mr. Townsend<br> is in the front parlor, sir.<br> Good morning, Mr. Townsend.<br> How do you do, sir? You expected me?<br> Yes, I did. You are admirably prompt.<br> I could hardly be late<br> for so important an occasion.<br> Yes. Catherine told me yesterday<br> what has been going on between you.<br> - Will you sit down?<br> - Thank you.<br> I've been walking all morning.<br> Sir, I find New York<br> as lovely as any city in Europe<br> this time of year.<br> Yes. You must allow me to say,<br> Mr. Townsend,<br> that it would've been becoming of you<br> to give me notice of your intentions<br> before they had gone so far.<br> It was only the other day that<br> Catherine made your acquaintance.<br> We have not been slow<br> to arrive at an understanding.<br> My interest in Miss Sloper<br> began the first time I saw her.<br> Did it not even precede<br> your first meeting?<br> I certainly had already heard<br> she was a delightful girl.<br> A delightful girl,<br> that's what you think her?<br> Otherwise I shouldn't be here.<br> My dear young man,<br> as Catherine's father,<br> I hope I have a just appreciation<br> of her many good qualities.<br> But I don't mind telling you I've<br> never thought of her in that light.<br> I don't know what I might think<br> of her if I were her father.<br> I speak from my own point of view.<br> You speak very well. Please sit down.<br> Did you really expect that I would<br> throw my daughter into your arms?<br> No, I had an idea you didn't like me.<br> - What gave you that idea?<br> - The fact that I'm poor.<br> Well, that has a harsh sound<br> but it's about the truth.<br> You have no profession, means.<br> Please sit.<br> No visible resources or prospects.<br> And so you are in a category from<br> which not to choose a son-in-law.<br> Particularly not for my daughter who<br> is a weak woman with a large fortune.<br> I don't think she is weak.<br> Even if she were not,<br> you are still penniless.<br> Yes, that is my weakness<br> and therefore you mean I'm mercenary.<br> - I don't say that. You say that.<br> - But that's what you mean.<br> There are many poor men,<br> Mr. Townsend,<br> but they do not proclaim<br> that they're not thieves,<br> especially when no one<br> has accused them.<br> I simply said<br> you are in the wrong category.<br> But your daughter doesn't marry<br> a category. She marries a man,<br> a man she's good enough<br> to say she loves.<br> A man who offers nothing in return.<br> Is it possible to offer more than<br> affection and lifelong devotion?<br> Lifelong devotion<br> is measured after the fact.<br> It's usual to offer<br> a few material securities.<br> What are yours? A handsome face<br> and figure and a good manner.<br> All are excellent as far as they go<br> but they don't go far enough.<br> - You think I'm an idler?<br> - It doesn't matter what I think.<br> I just don't think of you<br> as a son-in-law.<br> - You think I'd squander her money?<br> - Ah, I plead guilty to that.<br> Because I spent my own, I suppose.<br> It was just because it was my own<br> that I spent it. I've made no debts.<br> When it was gone, I stopped.<br> I don't owe a penny in the world.<br> Allow me to ask.<br> What are you living on now?<br> The remnants of my property.<br> You left your gloves here yesterday.<br> Thank you.<br> Doctor, don't you care<br> to gratify your daughter?<br> Do you enjoy the idea<br> of making her miserable?<br> I'm resigned to her thinking me<br> a tyrant for a few months.<br> - A few months?<br> - For a lifetime, then.<br> She may as well be miserable that way<br> as with you.<br> - You are not polite, sir.<br> - You push me to it.<br> - You argue too much.<br> - I have a great deal at stake.<br> I know and you have lost it.<br> It is over.<br> I wouldn't be too sure of that, sir.<br> You are impertinent.<br> Dr. Sloper, if it were not<br> for my feeling for Catherine,<br> I should not have put up with<br> the indignities you've offered.<br> You have only to leave my house to<br> escape them. Good day, Mr. Townsend.<br> - Good day.<br> - Morris, wait!<br> Morris! You promised me, Morris.<br> You promised you would be respectful<br> when you saw my father.<br> - Catherine.<br> - What is the matter, Father?<br> Catherine, you are without dignity.<br> Why are you angry? Why are you and<br> Morris quarrelling? Tell me, please.<br> - I will tell you when we are alone.<br> - Your father does not approve of me.<br> - You want me to give him up?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Why? What has he done?<br> What did Mrs. Montgomery tell you?<br> My sister, have you spoken with her?<br> She paid my a visit this morning<br> on my invitation.<br> You see how painful this is for me,<br> Father.<br> Surely you would want me<br> to know your reasons.<br> - He's a selfish idler.<br> - My sister never said that.<br> - No, I say it.<br> - Father, I know he loves me.<br> I know that he does not.<br> In heaven's name, Father,<br> what makes you so sure?<br> My poor child, I can't tell you.<br> You must just take my word for it.<br> Father, I can't.<br> I can't.<br> I love him.<br> I have promised to marry him,<br> to stay by him no matter what comes.<br> So, he forearmed himself<br> by getting a promise like that?<br> - You are beneath contempt.<br> - Don't abuse him, Father.<br> I think we shall marry quite soon.<br> That is no further concern of mine.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Dr. Sloper.<br> We cannot marry<br> without your approval.<br> It would bring unhappiness<br> to all of us.<br> - Do you mean that, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> Then, will you put it off,<br> Mr. Townsend, for six months?<br> I would like Catherine<br> to go to Europe with me.<br> - Europe?<br> - I would like you very much to go.<br> - Why, Father?<br> - He thinks you will forget me.<br> I shall still love him<br> when I come back.<br> You're very sure of your love but,<br> Catherine, do you dare to test him?<br> - You underestimate him.<br> - I don't think so.<br> Catherine, go to Europe.<br> Go to Europe with your father.<br> That way, sir.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Good morning, Doctor.<br> Good morning, ma'am. Catherine.<br> I came because I felt sure you would<br> not deny me the opportunity<br> of wishing you both a safe journey.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Morris, I'm glad you came.<br> I've brought Miss Sloper<br> a small gift, sir.<br> It is not usual for young ladies<br> in my daughter's situation<br> to receive gifts from gentlemen.<br> Yes, Doctor, I know,<br> but this is a very humble gift.<br> - It's only a little hand warmer.<br> - Father, I would like to have it.<br> Just put live charcoals in it,<br> Catherine.<br> - I give it to you with all my love.<br> - Morris!<br> I will be thinking of you, Catherine.<br> Good day, ma'am. Bon voyage, Doctor.<br> I never expected to hear a sermon<br> like that in New York City.<br> When the Reverend Penniman<br> sermonized on the loaves and fishes,<br> they were right before you.<br> You could practically smell them.<br> - Look, Mrs. Penniman, you've lost.<br> - Why is it you always win?<br> I cheat.<br> Had it not been for your invitations,<br> these past few months<br> would have been unbearable.<br> You like this house, don't you,<br> Morris?<br> Yes, ma'am, I do.<br> You know,<br> the doctor is a man of fine taste.<br> Although we do not like each other,<br> we seem to like the same things.<br> That can be a bond<br> between you in time.<br> I hope so. He has earned<br> all of this by his work.<br> He believes that every man<br> should do the same.<br> The trouble is<br> that some of us cannot.<br> - You miss her, don't you, Morris?<br> - Very much.<br> - Dinner is served, Mrs. Penniman.<br> - Yes, Maria.<br> - And the claret is room temperature.<br> - Thank you, Maria.<br> - I hope I haven't kept you waiting.<br> - No, my dear.<br> - Wouldn't you prefer to go inside?<br> - I like this table.<br> Oh, did you use to come here<br> with my mother?<br> Yes, Catherine, I did.<br> Would you like some chocolate?<br> No, thank you very much.<br> - Oh! There's the Caf Riche.<br> - So it is. What about it?<br> Aunt Penniman mentioned it<br> in her last letter.<br> Lavinia?<br> She said that<br> all the best people of...<br> ...Paris frequent it.<br> A winter of loneliness<br> has given her second sight.<br> - Something for mademoiselle?<br> - No.<br> Bien, monsieur.<br> Have you given him up?<br> No, Father.<br> You mean that in all this time<br> you have not yielded one inch?<br> No, Father.<br> I see no reason<br> to prolong this trip. Do you?<br> I thought you wanted to see England.<br> I've seen England.<br> Pilot's going down the bay.<br> They are to dock within the hour.<br> We're almost ready.<br> - Maria, did you find my gloves?<br> - I'll look again.<br> Geier, we have to be at the pier<br> in half an hour.<br> Ma'am.<br> What an inconvenient hour to land!<br> Now, you will be careful<br> to get the details right?<br> - They are most important.<br> - Of course.<br> You will have a closed carriage<br> at the corner of McDougal Street<br> tomorrow evening<br> as soon as it gets dark.<br> - Tomorrow night at 9:00.<br> - Yes, at 9:00.<br> Oh, here they are!<br> - Now, tell her everything.<br> - I will.<br> - Tell her I love her.<br> - I will.<br> You wait in the mews for my signal,<br> Morris.<br> Giddy up.<br> Oh, Catherine!<br> Oh, Catherine, you look so French.<br> Well, no matter how fascinating<br> distant places are,<br> there's always someone at home<br> one misses, isn't there?<br> I've caught a chill, Lavinia.<br> Would you be so kind as to get me<br> some hot water for a toddy?<br> Why, of course, Austin.<br> It's good to be home, isn't it,<br> Father?<br> You'll feel better<br> now that we're back.<br> I... I wish you had let me<br> try to care of you a little.<br> - Here you are, Austin.<br> - Thank you, Lavinia.<br> Your brandy decanter is right there.<br> Well...<br> Have you taken to drink, Lavinia?<br> My heart,<br> I thought it would help my heart.<br> Ah, yes.<br> I know I shouldn't ask, Catherine,<br> but did you bring me something?<br> - We brought you a silk parasol.<br> - Just exactly what I wanted.<br> Come and show it to me.<br> Your heart would improve, Lavinia,<br> if you stopped smoking cigars.<br> When I come home to find<br> an empty brandy glass<br> and a particular cigar brand,<br> I can only think of one person.<br> Well, what's happened to Mr. Townsend?<br> - Is he upstairs in my bed?<br> - Austin, I forgot to tell you.<br> - He did stop by this evening.<br> - This evening?<br> - Was he here this evening, Aunt?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - He's made my house his club.<br> - You should be in bed.<br> Now, I'll just see that everything<br> has been attended to.<br> What a ridiculous position to be in.<br> Well, I suppose you'll be going off<br> with him any time now.<br> Yes, if he will have me.<br> Why not? You'll be<br> a most entertaining companion.<br> - I will try to be.<br> - Your gaiety and brilliance<br> will make up the difference between<br> the 10,000 a year you will have<br> and the 30,000 he expects.<br> He expects nothing.<br> He does not love me for that.<br> No? What else, then?<br> Your grace, your charm,<br> your quick tongue and subtle wit?<br> He admires me.<br> I've tried for months<br> not to be unkind.<br> But now it's time<br> for you to realize the truth.<br> How many girls do you think he might<br> have had in this town?<br> - He finds me pleasing.<br> - Oh, yes, I'm sure he does.<br> A hundred women are prettier,<br> a thousand more clever.<br> But you have one virtue<br> that outshines them all.<br> - What? What is that?<br> - Your money!<br> - Father!<br> - You have nothing else!<br> Oh.<br> What a terrible thing to say to me.<br> I don't expect you to believe that.<br> I've known you all your life<br> and I've yet to see you<br> learn anything.<br> With one exception, my dear.<br> You embroider neatly.<br> Morris.<br> Morris!<br> - I haven't had a moment with her.<br> - Where is she?<br> She's upstairs with Austin.<br> He's out of mood. You'd better leave.<br> - I'll tell her everything.<br> - I want to tell her myself.<br> - I'll wait until he's gone to bed.<br> - No, please go.<br> - If Austin should see you...<br> - He won't. I'll stay here.<br> No, I'll take her shopping in the<br> morning and meet you in the square.<br> Please go.<br> Morris. Morris!<br> Morris!<br> Morris, I'm so, so glad.<br> Cathy.<br> You were waiting!<br> You were as anxious as I.<br> Oh!<br> - Cathy.<br> - Oh, Morris.<br> - Have you been true to me?<br> - Oh, yes!<br> Yes. You've not changed your mind?<br> No, no! Have you?<br> Oh, wait until you hear my plans.<br> - Plans?<br> - Yes.<br> For our marriage.<br> - Our elopement.<br> - Oh, our elopement!<br> It's for tomorrow night. In a country<br> parsonage up on Murray's Hill,<br> there's the Reverend Lispenard<br> who knows our story. He'll help us.<br> Do you hear me, Catherine?<br> Oh, I love you so.<br> Tell me what to do.<br> I have a closed carriage engaged.<br> I will come to the corner of<br> the square tomorrow night at 9:00.<br> We'll drive to the parsonage.<br> After the marriage, we'll spend<br> the night at an inn up the river.<br> The next day we'll go to Albany<br> on our honeymoon.<br> Oh, Morris!<br> My husband!<br> - You like my plan?<br> - Oh.<br> And I've brought you<br> such a beautiful silk waistcoat.<br> - You must wear it for our wedding.<br> - My dear girl!<br> I bought you a set of buttons<br> in Paris.<br> - Buttons?<br> - They are rubies and pearls.<br> - They are quite nice.<br> - Dear girl, how happy we shall be.<br> - Morris?<br> - Yes?<br> - Take me tonight.<br> - Tonight?<br> - How can we?<br> - We must.<br> In another hour,<br> everyone will be asleep.<br> We can get away quietly<br> and no one will know.<br> But, Catherine,<br> it's only one more day.<br> - Morris, I beg you.<br> - Where would we go?<br> - To the Reverend Lisp...<br> - Lispenard.<br> Yes! He will not turn us away<br> because we've come one day early.<br> - I implore you!<br> - Catherine.<br> If you love me...<br> - Very well, we'll do it.<br> - Oh!<br> I'll leave and find a carriage.<br> It's almost 10:30.<br> I can be back here at 12:30<br> on the dot in front of the house.<br> You must be ready and waiting for me.<br> Will you do that?<br> Oh, I can do anything, my dearest.<br> - Leave a letter for your father.<br> - A letter?<br> - Yes. Shall I compose it for you?<br> - No.<br> Think very carefully of how<br> to word it. You must melt his heart.<br> - I will not write him.<br> - Of course you must write him.<br> - We want him to forgive us.<br> - He won't forgive us. I know it.<br> I know it now. I have good reason to.<br> - What reason?<br> - My father doesn't like me.<br> What an unhappy thing to say.<br> Of course he does.<br> - No.<br> - He must love you very much<br> or he wouldn't try so hard<br> to protect you from me.<br> No, Morris, in this one thing<br> I know I am right.<br> I couldn't say it unless I was sure.<br> I understood it tonight<br> for the first time in my life.<br> You can tell when a person speaks<br> to you as if... as if...<br> - As if what?<br> - As if they despised you.<br> Despised?<br> We must be very happy together and<br> you must never despise me, Morris.<br> - Catherine.<br> - We must never ask him for anything<br> or depend upon him for anything.<br> We must be very happy<br> and expect nothing from him ever.<br> No.<br> I will try to be<br> the best wife in the world.<br> - I know you will.<br> - I will get ready immediately.<br> Catherine, dear.<br> He can't dislike you that much.<br> He's bound to come round.<br> No, Morris, he will not.<br> But even if he would, I would not.<br> I see.<br> I will try to be punctual, Morris.<br> I know you like that.<br> - So, 12:30, then.<br> - Hurry, my darling!<br> - Catherine.<br> - Shhh.<br> What are you doing?<br> I'd like it if you'd go back to bed.<br> But I want to know what you're doing.<br> I am eloping with Morris.<br> That's impossible, it's for tomorrow.<br> - Hush.<br> - No, you've got everything wrong.<br> Now, Morris will be here<br> tomorrow evening.<br> No, he will be here<br> in the next two minutes.<br> - Have you seen him?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, Catherine. Will you spend<br> the night with him unwed?<br> We are going directly to<br> Reverend Lispenard on Murray's Hill.<br> If he will marry us<br> perhaps we may stay with him.<br> If not, we will drive all night.<br> I don't care.<br> Oh, Catherine. How romantic.<br> - Morris is so daring.<br> - I think I heard a carriage.<br> No.<br> Wouldn't you like me to dress<br> and come with you?<br> There's no time.<br> Morris will be here any instant.<br> But I should.<br> You must have a chaperone.<br> - Your father would be shocked.<br> - Serves him right.<br> Father, he finds me so dull.<br> It would surprise him to have such<br> a dull girl disgrace his name.<br> Catherine, are you quite yourself?<br> It was just a shutter blowing.<br> Think of it. I may never stand<br> in this window again.<br> I may never see Washington Square<br> on a windy April night.<br> Why won't you?<br> Because I will never be<br> in this house again.<br> Nonsense. You and Austin<br> will be reconciled within the year.<br> I will never see him again<br> in my life.<br> What?<br> I'm leaving tonight<br> instead of tomorrow<br> because it is one time less<br> I will ever have to lay eyes on him<br> or he on me.<br> We dislike each other too much, Aunt.<br> Good heavens, child.<br> You are disinheriting yourself.<br> - Yes. Completely.<br> - Have you told Morris this?<br> Of course. I told him everything.<br> He is to be my husband.<br> Oh, you should have waited.<br> Did... Did he understand?<br> There he is. Goodbye, Aunt.<br> I will write to you.<br> - Aunt?<br> - Yes, dear?<br> Why shouldn't I have told Morris?<br> Oh, dear girl. Why were you<br> not a little more clever?<br> Clever? About what?<br> Oh, Catherine.<br> Why shouldn't I have told him?<br> Morris would not want to be the cause<br> of your losing<br> your natural inheritance.<br> He could not see you impoverished.<br> Impoverished?<br> I have ten thousand a year.<br> That is a great deal of money.<br> Not when one has expected 30.<br> You think what my father thinks.<br> Well, you are wrong. Morris loves me.<br> I am everything<br> he ever yearned for in a woman.<br> - Oh, Catherine.<br> - I am. I am. He has told me so.<br> He thinks I am pretty. He wants me.<br> He could not wait for tomorrow night.<br> He said we must go tonight.<br> No, I said that, didn't I?<br> But he agreed. He was willing.<br> You can see that for yourself.<br> He was very willing.<br> Well, then, perhaps he will come.<br> Perhaps? He must come.<br> He must take me away.<br> He must love me. He must.<br> Please take hold of yourself.<br> No, no. Morris must take hold of me.<br> Morris will love me<br> for all those who didn't.<br> Morris! Morris! Morris!<br> Morris! Morris! Morris!<br> I'm sorry,<br> the Doctor's office is closed.<br> I heard he came back from Europe.<br> He did, but he's confined to his bed.<br> Try Dr. Isaacs in Great Jones Street.<br> Thank you.<br> - Doctor. You shouldn't be up, sir.<br> - Now, stop fluttering about.<br> - Doctor, please go back to bed.<br> - You just go about your business.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Ah, Catherine.<br> I haven't seen you since I returned.<br> No, Father.<br> Of course, if he were ill,<br> he could not write.<br> Perhaps you should send him<br> a brief note.<br> - No, Aunt.<br> - But I'd gladly deliver it for you.<br> Stay out of it, Aunt.<br> I want to help, if I can.<br> Can you bring him back<br> from California?<br> California?<br> I went to Mrs. Montgomery's<br> to see him.<br> You didn't?<br> She told me.<br> He borrowed the passage money<br> from his cousin Arthur... and left.<br> You had better go to your market.<br> - Oh, one moment, Maria.<br> - Yes, Doctor?<br> If you will interrupt your<br> embroidery for a moment, Catherine.<br> I... I think you both<br> should know this.<br> I am ill.<br> It's not just a simple congestion,<br> there are rales in the lungs.<br> I shall need very good nursing.<br> I shall not recover but I wish<br> everything to be done as if I should.<br> - I hate an ill-conducted sickroom.<br> - Maybe you will get well.<br> Now, in a few days you will need<br> a doctor. Get Dr. Isaacs.<br> If the street noises make me<br> restless, see the tanbark's put down.<br> Catherine, I don't want your<br> Aunt Lavinia in my room at all.<br> Unless I should go in to a coma.<br> As for food, don't overload me. Keep<br> me on soup. Beef broth and gruel.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Find a small lamp. Put fresh wicks<br> in it so that it doesn't smell.<br> Doctor.<br> Now, will you please make up my bed<br> for me? I'll be up in a moment.<br> Yes.<br> - I will help you, Maria.<br> - Will you stay a minute, Catherine?<br> I can only assume<br> that your departure is imminent.<br> Is it soon? This week?<br> No.<br> Has he asked you to keep your plans<br> secret from me?<br> I am not leaving.<br> - Not leaving?<br> - Will you excuse me, Father?<br> Come here for a moment.<br> Here, in the light.<br> You are flushed. Your eyes look sick.<br> You have been weeping.<br> You have broken your engagement.<br> Oh, if you have, I must tell you,<br> Catherine,<br> that I admire you greatly for it.<br> I know the effort you must have made.<br> - Do you, Father?<br> - But in time the pain will pass.<br> I cannot begin to tell you<br> how proud of you I am.<br> - Are you?<br> - Oh, deeply. Most deeply proud.<br> He deserted me.<br> What?<br> Morris deserted me.<br> - Now do you admire me, Father?<br> - Oh, Catherine.<br> Don't be kind to me.<br> It doesn't become you.<br> Are you blaming me<br> because I tried to protect you?<br> Yes.<br> Someday you will realize<br> I have done you a great service.<br> I can tell you now what you<br> have done. You have cheated me.<br> You thought any handsome, clever man<br> would be as bored with me<br> as you were.<br> It was not love that made you<br> protect me, it was contempt.<br> Morris Townsend did not love you,<br> Catherine.<br> I know that now, thanks to you.<br> Better to know it now<br> than 20 years hence.<br> Why? I lived with you for 20 years<br> before I found out<br> you didn't love me.<br> Morris may not have have hurt me<br> or starved me of affection<br> more than you did.<br> Since you couldn't love me,<br> you should have let someone else try.<br> You have found a tongue at last,<br> Catherine.<br> It is only to say<br> such terrible things to me.<br> Yes. This is a field where you<br> will not compare me to my mother.<br> Should I have let him ruin your life?<br> You'll find some honest, decent man.<br> - You have many fine qualities.<br> - And 30,000 a year.<br> Yes. That should make it possible<br> for you to choose with discretion.<br> If I am to buy a man,<br> I would prefer buying Morris.<br> Don't say such things.<br> You know him to be a scoundrel.<br> I love him.<br> Does that humiliate you?<br> Promise me you are done with him!<br> - I won't promise.<br> - Then, I must alter my will.<br> You should.<br> You should do it immediately.<br> "I, Austin Sloper,<br> surgeon of 16 Washington Square..."<br> You had better tell me<br> how you wish it worded.<br> - I wish to consider more carefully.<br> - There is nothing to consider.<br> You want your money<br> used for purposes you approve.<br> Leave it to the clinic.<br> It will do as you wish.<br> Catherine, I am ill.<br> "...hereby make<br> my last will and testament."<br> I don't want to do it. I don't want<br> to disinherit my only child.<br> I know that you don't.<br> You'd like to think of me sitting<br> in dignity in this handsome house,<br> rich, respected and unloved.<br> But I may take your money and chase<br> after Morris and squander it on him.<br> I don't know what you would do,<br> Catherine.<br> That's right, Father.<br> You'll never know, will you?<br> Catherine.<br> Dr. Isaacs said you'd better come now.<br> Your father is very low, miss.<br> He wants you, miss.<br> I know he does.<br> Too late, Maria.<br> Yes, miss.<br> Tell Lavinia I'm sorry we missed her.<br> - I will, Aunt Elizabeth.<br> - Come along. Arthur's waiting.<br> - Alright, I'm coming.<br> - Say goodbye to Aunt Catherine.<br> - Goodbye, Aunt Catherine.<br> - Goodbye, Andrew.<br> Here, Mother, you take Andrew.<br> Goodbye.<br> That's right.<br> Why don't you come up this August?<br> You'd love Newport. Jefferson and I<br> have taken a big house this year.<br> Maybe I will.<br> We've asked you every year<br> since your father died.<br> You always say, "Maybe I will."<br> Then you never do.<br> I like the square.<br> - Goodbye, Catherine.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Say goodbye, Andrew.<br> - Goodbye, Aunt Catherine.<br> Goodbye.<br> Oh, Miss Catherine. You've changed<br> into one of your Paris gowns.<br> - You look very handsome in it.<br> - Thank you.<br> It's such a hot night.<br> Would you mind if cook and I<br> took a stroll in the square?<br> Maria, you are as free in this house<br> as I am.<br> When you want a favor you need not<br> blandish me with false compliments.<br> But... But, Miss Catherine,<br> I meant what I said.<br> It was the coolest dress<br> I could find.<br> Yes, miss.<br> - Aunt Penniman, you're home early.<br> - Yes, dear. Yes.<br> Did you see your friends<br> from Poughkeepsie?<br> No, dear, I did not. Now, this will<br> come to you as a great surprise.<br> Good, I like surprises.<br> Well, then...<br> I have seen Morris Townsend.<br> We met quite by accident.<br> He has only been home a week. Oh!<br> Catherine, he is so handsome.<br> And he asked so many questions<br> about you, dear.<br> He had heard that you hadn't married.<br> He seemed very interested in that.<br> He fears that you never understood<br> him, never judged him rightly.<br> How can you say that to me?<br> You were in this room<br> the night he deserted me.<br> If you will hear him out,<br> and if you would try to understand<br> his side of it, Catherine.<br> He meant it nobly. Really, he did.<br> I can hear<br> that you have been with him.<br> He has beguiled you again.<br> You talk like a fool.<br> I don't care what you think of me.<br> I am convinced you will be happier<br> after you've seen him.<br> Save your breath, Aunt Penniman.<br> I will not see him.<br> Aunt Penniman, have you dared?<br> He walked home with me.<br> He implored me to ask you.<br> Oh, I only want your happiness,<br> Catherine.<br> Go to the door, Aunt, and tell<br> Mr. Townsend that I am not at home.<br> - Please, Catherine.<br> - I am not at home.<br> She is not at home, Morris.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Did you give her my message?<br> Yes, but she is not at home.<br> I see.<br> It has been a long time<br> since I stood here.<br> I know.<br> Well, I'm sorry.<br> - Good night, Mrs. Penniman.<br> - Goodbye, Morris.<br> Come in, Morris.<br> - Good evening, Morris.<br> - Good evening, Catherine.<br> Do I offend you by coming?<br> You should not have come.<br> I had to.<br> I had to see you, Catherine.<br> - May we not sit down?<br> - I think we had better not.<br> Can't we be friends again?<br> We aren't enemies.<br> You don't know how happy it makes me<br> to hear you say that.<br> I've never ceased to think of you.<br> If you cannot be honest with me,<br> we shall have nothing more to say<br> to each other.<br> But it's true, Catherine.<br> Ever since... the night I left,<br> it's been the desire of my life that<br> you should understand my motives.<br> I have had years<br> to think about them, Morris.<br> And I understand them. So we have<br> nothing further to discuss.<br> I will bid you good night.<br> But I've come all the way<br> from California to see you.<br> To explain this to you.<br> - It is late for explanations.<br> - No, Catherine.<br> I would have been back long since<br> but I had to beg and borrow<br> the passage money.<br> It's been a real struggle for me<br> to get back here.<br> Why, between New Orleans<br> and Charleston I worked as a hand,<br> a common seaman.<br> Now that I'm here, you will give me<br> the chance to vindicate myself.<br> You must hear me out, Catherine.<br> You must.<br> For the sake of what we have been<br> to each other.<br> What is it you want to explain?<br> Many things, Catherine.<br> May we not sit down now?<br> Catherine, it was because I loved you<br> that I disappeared that night.<br> I know how it looked.<br> I behaved abominably.<br> But I knew that if I returned<br> that night,<br> I might have done you great harm.<br> No man who really loves a woman<br> could ever permit her to give up<br> a great inheritance just for him.<br> It's only in storybooks.<br> My father did not disinherit me,<br> Morris. He threatened it to test you.<br> But I couldn't be sure of that<br> the night... I went away.<br> No, you could not.<br> Try to understand me, Catherine.<br> Try not to think of what<br> it looked like but of what it was.<br> I had to make a choice. I chose<br> your welfare rather than my own.<br> - Can you think of it that way?<br> - I will try.<br> You know that I have never changed.<br> I believe your nature is that you<br> will always care for me a little.<br> Yes, Morris, that is true.<br> Catherine, will you forgive me<br> for the pain I caused you?<br> I forgave you a long time ago.<br> Oh, Catherine, my dearest.<br> We have only waited<br> and now, now we're free.<br> Nothing stands between us, Catherine.<br> Do you mean you love me?<br> I didn't dare to say it.<br> - Why not?<br> - I wasn't sure you would believe me.<br> I believed you once, didn't I?<br> Catherine, let us make the rest<br> of life happy for each other.<br> How?<br> By... picking up where we left off.<br> By marrying, Catherine.<br> Would you like that, Morris?<br> It would make me the proudest<br> and happiest man in the world.<br> And I will try and be a good husband<br> to you. I'm older, I'm wiser now.<br> And I know that you love me.<br> I need that.<br> I need it more than anything else.<br> When would you like to marry me?<br> Oh, Catherine.<br> Then, you will. Let's marry soon.<br> Very soon. Next month.<br> You are not as impetuous<br> as you used to be, Morris.<br> Impetuous? Why,<br> I would marry you tonight if I could.<br> Come with me now,<br> we can find a carriage in the square.<br> Do you think the Reverend Lispenard<br> is still waiting?<br> We could tell him we were detained.<br> Oh, Morris, I have thought so many<br> times of that inn up the river.<br> My own dearest.<br> Shall we have the same honeymoon?<br> You must give me time to pack.<br> Yes, of course.<br> My things are at my sister's. I'll...<br> We'll pick them up on the way.<br> Why don't you get them now, Morris,<br> and come back for me?<br> Alright, I will. We can be<br> at Murray's Hill in an hour.<br> We can be there by ten.<br> Do you remember the buttons<br> I bought for you in Paris?<br> - Buttons?<br> - Wait, I will get them.<br> Oh!<br> I'm home.<br> Really, truly home.<br> What, Morris? What?<br> - She's magnificent.<br> - Yes.<br> - She's superb.<br> - Yes.<br> - She has such dignity now.<br> - Tell me.<br> - We're going to be married tonight.<br> - Tonight? Catherine, my dear girl!<br> Here they are, Morris,<br> your wedding present.<br> Thank you, my darling.<br> Oh, Catherine, they're rubies.<br> Look, Mrs. Penniman.<br> I've seen them. They sparkle so.<br> They suit you, Morris.<br> Yes, they do.<br> They're the most beautiful things<br> I've ever had.<br> Catherine, you'll have no regrets.<br> Till nine, then.<br> Oh, Catherine, we have him back.<br> I knew it would turn out this way.<br> You were not so sure as I,<br> but I had faith in love like this.<br> Oh, I hope I always stay romantic.<br> You know, Catherine, you are much<br> more romantic than you think you are.<br> Morris sensed that. Don't bother<br> about that, dear, I'll do it.<br> That beautiful Paris lingerie,<br> how fortunate that you kept it.<br> I'm going to pack that for you.<br> I'll sprinkle it with fresh lavender.<br> Catherine, wouldn't you like me<br> to come with you?<br> Come, dear, we must pack.<br> Catherine, you haven't time for that.<br> - There's not much left to do.<br> - But you can finish it afterwards.<br> I must finish it now,<br> for I shall never do another.<br> No?<br> He came back with the same lies.<br> The same silly phrases.<br> What... What are you saying?<br> He has grown greedier with the years.<br> The first time he only wanted<br> my money, now he wants my love, too.<br> Well, he came to the wrong house,<br> and he came twice.<br> I shall see<br> that he never comes a third time.<br> Catherine,<br> do you know what you're doing?<br> Yes.<br> Poor Morris.<br> Can you be so cruel?<br> Yes, I can be very cruel.<br> I have been taught by masters.<br> Right here.<br> Wait.<br> - I will attend to that. It's for me.<br> - Yes, miss.<br> Bolt it, Maria.<br> - Bolt it?<br> - Bolt the door, Maria.<br> Yes, miss.<br> Good night, Maria.<br> Good night, miss.<br> Catherine.<br> Catherine.<br> Catherine!<br> Catherine.<br> Catherine!<br> Catherine!<br> Catherine!<br> Catherine!<br> Catherine!<br> Catherine! Catherine! Catherine!<br> Catherine!<br>
