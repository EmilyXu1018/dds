Come on.<br> Miss Stein, you said in your letter<br> to write about what disturbs me,<br> particularly if it bothers no one else.<br> Come on.<br> And I understand that now.<br> Continue.<br> I'd like to write something<br> from the point of view of the help.<br> These colored women<br> raise white children,<br> and in 20 years,<br> those children become the boss.<br> We love them and they love us,<br> but they can't even use the toilets<br> in our houses.<br> Don't you find that ironic, Miss Stein?<br> I'm listening.<br> Margaret Mitchell glorified<br> the mammy figure,<br> who dedicates her whole life<br> to a white family.<br> But nobody ever asked Mammy<br> how she felt about it.<br> So, a side to this never before heard?<br> Yes.<br> 'Cause nobody ever really<br> talks about it down here.<br> Skeeter, who are you<br> talking to in there?<br> Go away!<br> - Who was that?<br> - My mother.<br> Look.<br> No maid in her right mind is ever gonna<br> tell you the truth.<br> That's a hell of a risk to take in<br> a place like Jackson, Mississippi.<br> I already have a maid.<br> Really? A Negro maid has already agreed<br> to speak with you?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Well... I guess I can read<br> what you come up with.<br> The book biz could use<br> a little rattling.<br> Thank you, Miss Stein.<br> Hey, hey, hey, all I'm saying<br> is that I'll let you know<br> if it's even worth pursuing.<br> And for God's sake, you're<br> a 23-year-old educated woman.<br> Go get yourself an apartment.<br> "Dear Miss Myrna:<br> When I'm chopping onions, how do I<br> keep tears out of my eyes?"<br> Shoot, that's easy. You tell<br> her hold a matchstick between her teeth.<br> Is it lit?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Miss Leefolt said<br> you could start right away.<br> Build it just like the bathroom<br> at my house. Let's see.<br> - Right there. That will be nice.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> My goodness, we got to run back<br> to the car. Come on.<br> Bye, Skeeter!<br> Aibileen.<br> There's something else I want to<br> write about. I would need your help.<br> I want to interview you about<br> what it's like to work as a maid.<br> I'd like to do a book of interviews<br> about working for white families.<br> And we could show what it's like<br> to work for, say, Elizabeth?<br> You know what Miss Leefolt do to me if<br> she knew I was telling stories on her?<br> I was thinking that we wouldn't<br> have to tell her.<br> The other maids would have<br> to keep it a secret, too.<br> Other maids?<br> I was hoping to get four or five.<br> To show what it's really like<br> in Jackson.<br> Show what y'all get paid,<br> and the babies and the bathrooms.<br> The good and the bad.<br> I bought you this damn house.<br> I put up with your new clothes<br> and trips to New Orleans,<br> but this takes the goddamn cake.<br> Hilly spoke to the surgeon general,<br> and she also said it'll add value<br> to our home.<br> I guess Mae Mobley can go to college<br> in that damn bathroom!<br> Hilly's covering the cost and said<br> you could just do William's taxes<br> to pay her back.<br> We don't take orders<br> from the Holbrooks.<br> Skeeter, how you doing?<br> Fine.<br> Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.<br> Aibileen, Mae Mobley's<br> crying her eyes out.<br> Skeeter.<br> I'm sorry, but I think it's best<br> if you leave now.<br> Oh, sure, sure.<br> And this Miss Myrna thing isn't going<br> to work out with Aibileen.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You're making it hotter,<br> flapping your arms like that, Minny.<br> Look how big the waves are, Minny.<br> Let's go to the beach.<br> Run, get Mr. Walters!<br> He loves riding these waves!<br> You know we went to Biloxi<br> on our honeymoon?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Are we in Biloxi, Minny?<br> No, ma'am.

Minny!<br> Please! Please!<br> Come here!<br> Please open your Bibles to Exodus.<br> Chapter four, verse ten.<br> God, having asked Moses<br> to free the Israelites...<br> ...Moses answered:<br> "Oh, my Lord. I am not eloquent.<br> I am slow of speech and slow of tongue. "<br> See, courage isn't just<br> about being brave.<br> Amen!<br> Courage is daring to do what is right<br> in spite of the weakness of our flesh.<br> And God tells us,<br> commands us, compels us,<br> - to love. Amen?<br> - Amen.<br> See, love,<br> as exemplified<br> by our Lord Jesus Christ,<br> is to be prepared to put yourself<br> in harm's way<br> for your fellow man.<br> And by your fellow man,<br> I mean your brother,<br> your sister, your neighbor,<br> your friend and your enemy.<br> If you can love your enemy,<br> you already have the victory.<br> Let's stand.

Thirty-one maids.<br> They all too scared. Think we crazy.<br> If we don't get more,<br> we're not getting published.<br> I gots plenty stories,<br> Miss Skeeter.<br> Just write them down<br> and invent the maid that said it.<br> You're already making up names.<br> Just make up the maids, too.<br> We're not gonna do that.<br> That would be wrong.<br> Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter.<br> It wouldn't be real.<br> They Killed my son.<br> He fell carrying two-by-fours<br> at the mill.<br> Truck run over him, crushed his lung.<br> Aibileen.<br> That white foreman threw his body<br> on back of a truck.<br> Drove to the colored hospital...<br> ...dumped him there and honked the horn.<br> There was nothing they could do,<br> so I brought my baby home.<br> Laid him down on that sofa right there.<br> He died right in front of me.<br> He was just 24 years old, Miss Skeeter.<br> Best part of a person's life.<br> Anniversary of his death comes...<br> ...every year, and I can't breathe.<br> But to y'all, it's just<br> another day of bridge.<br> You stop this...<br> ...everything I wrote, he wrote,<br> everything he was is gonna die with him.<br> I am just honored<br> to be hosting Elizabeth's shower.<br> Doesn't she look glowing, everybody?<br> Yes, she does!<br> Honey, you hold on to it,<br> to the bitter end.<br> - I'll try.<br> - Well, congratulations.<br> I'm hungry, Mommy.<br> She's always hungry.<br> You know she can hear you, Elizabeth.<br> I'll cut you<br> a piece of cake, baby. Go on, now.<br> Aibileen, are you enjoying your new<br> bathroom over at Elizabeth's'?<br> Nice to have your own.<br> Isn't it, Aibileen?<br> Yes, ma'am. And I thank you.<br> Separate, but equal.<br> That's what Ross Barnett says,<br> and you can't argue with the governor.<br> Well, certainly not in Mississippi,<br> the birthplace of modern-day government.<br> Hey, Miss Skeeter.<br> Can I get you something?<br> No, thanks.<br> Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you<br> about something.<br> I already know what you're gonna ask,<br> Miss Skeeter.<br> Minny and Aibileen already did.<br> I'm trying to get my boys<br> off to college.<br> It's worthwhile what<br> y'all are doing, but...<br> ...but my boys are worth more.<br> I understand.<br> What do you understand, Skeeter?<br> Yule Mae was just saying how excited she<br> is that her boys are going to college.<br> Did you also ask Miss Skeeter<br> if you could borrow money?<br> Of course not.<br> I'm gonna put Billy down for his nap.<br> Excuse me.<br> Come on, baby.<br> Skeeter, are you intentionally not<br> putting my initiative in the newsletter?<br> No, not at all. I just have been<br> really busy with Mama.<br> I know.<br> I know, you must be so worried<br> about your mother, but...<br> I'm worried about you.<br> Reading this stuff?<br> Believe it or not, there are real<br> racists in this town.<br> If the wrong person caught you<br> with anything like that,<br> you'd be in serious trouble.<br> I'll be on the lookout.<br> Put my initiative in the newsletter.<br> OK?<br> Skeeter, get up!<br> - No! What?<br> - We've got to get dressed.<br> What's wrong?<br> Don't panic. Don't panic.<br> There's a particularly tall and very<br> handsome man named Stuart here for you.<br> Oh, God.<br> Oh, mother.<br> You would not like him. Trust me.<br> He's a drunken asshole.<br> Love and hate are two horns on the same<br> goat, Eugenia, and you need a goat.<br> Put that on. Hurry!<br> Look, I know it was a few weeks back,<br> but I came to say I'm sorry<br> for the way I acted.<br> Who sent you, William or Hilly?<br> Neither.<br> Hilly. But I wanted to come, OK.<br> I was rude, and I've been<br> thinking about it a lot.<br> - Well, I haven't. So you can just go.<br> - Goddamn it!<br> I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on<br> any date. Wasn't even close to ready.<br> I was engaged last year. She ended it.<br> I'm sure she did.<br> It's not like that.<br> I'm not always a jerk.<br> We had been dating since we were 15,<br> and you know how it is.<br> Actually, I don't. I've never really<br> dated anyone before.<br> Ever?<br> Ever.<br> All right, I, uh...<br> Well, that must be it, then.<br> - What?<br> - You, Skeeter.<br> I've never met a woman that says<br> exactly what she's thinking.<br> - Well, I got plenty to say.<br> - Yeah, I'll bet you do.<br> You make me laugh, smile.<br> Would you like to come<br> have dinner with me?<br> We could talk. I could actually<br> listen to you this time.<br> I can't think of anything worse.<br> I understand, and I'm sorry.<br> That's what<br> I came here to say, and I said it.<br> Just give me a minute.<br> Let me get my sweater.<br> Not a big fan of oysters, huh?<br> Oysters are a vehicle<br> for crackers and ketchup.<br> Well, here's to new beginnings.<br> Mm.<br> You're disgusting.<br> You've already made that pretty clear.<br> And just so you know,<br> the boys caught me reading<br> your Miss Myrna column<br> on the rig the other day.<br> Really?

I know you do.<br> She was our president.<br> What was I supposed to do?<br> She did you the biggest favor of<br> your life. She taught me everything.<br> Well, you idolized her too much.<br> You always have.<br> I needed someone to look up to.<br> Well, I...<br> I went to her house the next day,<br> but she had already gone.<br> How could you not tell me all this?<br> Because I didn't want to upset you<br> during your final exams.<br> I knew you'd blame me,<br> and it wasn't my fault!<br> I have to go find her. She needs me.<br> - Eugenia.<br> - What?<br> We sent your brother up to Chicago<br> to bring Constantine home.<br> When he got there...<br> ...she had died.<br> You broke her heart.<br> I'm...<br> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!<br> I'm sorry.<br> They printed a few thousand copies<br> with the worst advance Miss Stein<br> had ever seen.<br> Baby, what you doing with Alicia book?<br> You can't read.<br> They sent Miss Skeeter $600. She broke<br> that money up and gave it to each of us.<br> Divided 13 ways,<br> that came to about $46 each.<br> Y'all finish your homework.<br> Aibileen. Aibileen!<br> We just got this from Miss Skeeter.<br> Look at it.<br> Look at it.<br> Look at it!<br> Minny, we're rich!<br> "She fired me<br> for using her inside toilet.<br> Put me out in a storm and told me never<br> to come back. But I did come back.<br> I came back with a pie I had baked<br> to say I'm sorry.<br> I watched her eat... "<br> Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly.<br> Filled with gripping testimonials<br> from Mississippi's housekeepers.<br> OK, Mama. I need to run.<br> Well. You should read the book, Hilly.<br> It's quite scandalous.<br> Sounds like... Jackson, if you ask me.<br> Quite scandalous.<br> What book?<br> What's it called again?<br> Uh...<br> The Help. H-E-L-P.<br> There it is.<br> You told me to write something good.<br> - Something I believed in.<br> - It's not what I believe in.<br> That joke you pulled with Hilly<br> with the toilets, that's funny.<br> Why would you do this to us?<br> I don't even know why you care.<br> - What?<br> - Things are fine around here.<br> Why go stir up trouble?<br> Trouble's already here, Stuart.<br> I had to tell you this.<br> You needed to know.<br> Goddamn right I needed to know. You<br> should have told me this from the start.<br> You're a selfish woman, Skeeter.<br> Stuart.<br> I think you're better off being alone.<br> Yeah.<br> Did you get to that part yet<br> that I was telling you about?<br> Don't read ahead, whatever you do.<br> "What you done put up in this?"<br> "She Said, 'My Shit. "'<br> What's the matter, Hilly?<br> - Get off of me! Get off!<br> - Ouch! Stop hitting me!<br> I heard that Betty character<br> might be Mary Elizabeth.<br> It's not Jackson.<br> And that book is garbage. I bet the<br> whole thing is made up by some nigra.<br> And Jolene, didn't your mama<br> leave Cora to you in her will?<br> Yes, but that's not odd, is it?<br> Happens all the time, right?<br> The book is not about Jackson.<br> What the hell?<br> What are you doing here?<br> I've contacted my lawyer.<br> Hibbie Goodman?
