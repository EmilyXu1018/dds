                        Hey, fella.<br> Ain't you Dan Roman?<br> Yeah.<br> I heard you whistling<br> and I said to myself,<br> only one guy does that just so.<br> I'd know that<br> ugly face of yours anywhere.<br> But you don't remember me, I bet you.<br> Sure I do. Ben Sneed.<br> I thought you'd be milking cows<br> somewheres on your own...<br> I mean, I thought you'd quit flying.<br> I thought you'd stay away<br> from these things.<br> They're only a hunk of metal.<br> They don't go no place in particular.<br> I guess I just haven't got<br> much willpower, Ben.<br> - What are you up to?<br> - Crew chiefing with Far East.<br> It's a good job.<br> I gotta go, Dan.<br> - I just thought I'd say hello.<br> - Sure. Good luck.<br> - Either one of you know that man?<br> - Sure looks old for a copilot.<br> - Didn't know we were so hard up.<br> - He weren't always a copilot.<br> We used to call him "Whistling Dan. "<br> One of the finest men you'd ever know.<br> And the most miserable. He was<br> down in Colombia same time I was.<br> He's taking off one night<br> with a full load<br> and one of them South American<br> line squalls<br> decided to hit the field at the same time.<br> The wind shifts too late for him to stop<br> and he don't quite make it over<br> a little hill at the end of the field.<br> I remember that one.<br> Right after the war, right?<br> Yeah. Dan hits flap,<br> but the ship breaks in half<br> and there's nothing but fire<br> in 10 seconds.<br> Dan gets tossed<br> through the cockpit window<br> and only gets a few scratches<br> plus that game leg of his.<br> Which leaves him alive to blame<br> himself. Everybody else gets killed.<br> Sounds to me like he was pretty lucky.<br> It don't work out quite that way.<br> I knew two of the passengers.<br> They were off to the coast for a holiday.<br> Blonde girl, name of Mary<br> and a little boy, name of Tony.<br> Everybody thought<br> they were wonderful people,<br> including Dan Roman.<br> Mary was Dan's wife<br> and little Tony was his only kid.<br> Yup.<br> Dan is the only guy I ever knew who<br> had guts enough not to commit suicide.<br> Flight 21 now arriving,<br> Gate 1, from Los Angeles.<br> Miss Betty Emsley,<br> please report to the information desk.<br> Nice to have you with us, Mr Flaherty.<br> Please check with immigration now.<br> You'll board in about 30 minutes.<br> This is Miss Spalding, your stewardess.<br> - I'll be in the bar.<br> - We'll call you, Mr Flaherty.<br> Trouble.<br> - Mr and Mrs Joseph?<br> - Yes, sirree.<br> The Waikiki kids.

Liberty and prosperity.<br> Bounded on the north by New York,<br> on the south by...<br> - And Mrs Joseph?<br> - Shall I tell him? I'm 33,<br> and I was born in Ogden, Utah.<br> Thank you, immensely.<br> Aloha.<br> - Hey, look. Remember?<br> - Yeah.<br> My name is Sally McKee.<br> I'm 30 years old.<br> I was born in Riverside, California.<br> - You're still a United States citizen?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> Thank you, Miss McKee.<br> Please check with immigration.<br> Your flight will be announced.<br> She may be put together<br> with paste and flour,<br> but that woman has something.<br> What would you say it was?<br> Practise. Plenty of practise.<br> - Aren't you...<br> - Yes, I'm Gustave Pardee.<br> I've enjoyed your New York shows<br> very much.<br> Good. Delighted.<br> Here are our tickets.<br> I'm 47 and I was born in New York City.<br> Mrs Pardee?<br> I'm 30,<br> and I was born in Owosso, Michigan.<br> - How will the weather be?<br> - Fine, Mr Pardee.<br> You should have a very pleasant trip.<br> He looks like a tired walrus on a rock.<br> She looks like she's done all right<br> for a slender redhead from Owosso.<br> - Ken Childs, 53. Born in Philadelphia.<br> - Yes, Mr Childs.<br> I don't know where my luggage is. The<br> Royal was supposed to send it down.<br> We'll check right into it, sir.<br> May I introduce your stewardess,<br> Miss Spalding.<br> Hello, sister. New here, aren't you?<br> Four months now with the company,<br> Mr Childs.<br> Good. I don't know where they get<br> some of the girls<br> but things are improving.<br> One of the few men who has ever made<br> any real money out of aviation.<br> He's one of our stockholders.<br> Treat him accordingly.<br> If you please.<br> - Dorothy Chen?<br> - Yes.<br> - Born in Antung, Manchuria?<br> - Yes, but I am Korean.<br> You have your passport handy,<br> of course.<br> Please take it to immigration.<br> It's just over there.<br> It's a real pleasure<br> to have you with us, Miss Chen.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - That face.<br> - A moon and a willow tree.<br> West Airlines,<br> Flight 7 from San Francisco,<br> now arriving, Gate 11.<br> I'm sorry I'm late, Skipper.

I don't want to make<br> no trouble for nobody.<br> Serving you will be a pleasure,<br> Mr Locota.<br> Thank you.<br> Just a minute, Mr Locota.<br> There you are.<br> Thank you. Excuse me very much.<br> You didn't know all about that little man.<br> The ticketing sheet had nothing on him<br> except statistics.<br> I'm afraid he falls into<br> the "nobody" category.<br> He's gonna be more<br> than a statistic to me. I like him.<br> Oh, brother.<br> Will I be glad to get on that plane.<br> Didn't you enjoy Honolulu?<br> Listen, honey, I always enjoy myself.<br> But this place,<br> Coney Island with coconuts.<br> As far as I'm concerned,<br> you can take all the Hawaiian Islands...<br> Tobey, will you tell your mother<br> something for me?<br> Tell your mother that there shouldn't be<br> an ocean between us.<br> Tell her I wish<br> she'd come with you next time.<br> - Can you remember all that, Tobey?<br> - Yes, Daddy.<br> I got him, Daddy. I got him.<br> - Everything okay, Dan?<br> - Yeah. Everything's fine.<br> There's a slight oil leak, Number 4.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> How long does it look like?<br> Lennie says 12 hours<br> and 15 minutes, about.<br> Twelve hours and 16 minutes exactly.<br> Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.<br> San Francisco.<br> I must go to San Francisco.<br> Sorry, sir, we're departing very shortly.<br> You're not on the list.<br> Mr Kenneth Childs is on your plane,<br> isn't he?<br> Why, yes. Mr Childs...<br> Then you must have room.<br> I insist. I must go.<br> Very well, sir. Fortunately<br> we have space available today<br> - if you're an American citizen.<br> - I am. I am for sure.<br> My name is Humphrey Agnew.<br> I'm the founder of Agnew Aids.<br> Right here in Honolulu.<br> Perhaps you've heard?<br> Yes. Do you have a travel card,<br> Mr Agnew?<br> I pay cash for everything.<br> If you'll just step across the lobby<br> and check with immigration,<br> then come right back here,<br> we'll have your ticket ready, sir.<br> Now, there goes a real quack.<br> He's made a fortune<br> selling Agnew's aids to better living.<br> What have you got?<br> Asthma, arthritis, ague, biliousness,<br> sticky liver?<br> Agnew has got a curing pill<br> for all of them.<br> - So long, Alsop. Have fun.<br> - I'll weep at your wedding, Spalding.<br> May I take your coat, Mrs Pardee?<br> - You all right, Mr Locota?<br> - Yes.<br> - We going to fly very high?<br> -7,000 or 9,000 feet, sir,<br> depends on our clearance.<br> Wouldn't you like to sit<br> next to the window, Mr Briscoe?<br> You know something, miss? This is<br> as far as the old carcass would go.<br> I'd rather look at you<br> than what's outside, anyhow.<br> Your seat belt isn't fastened.<br> Shame on you.<br> My arm just won't bend around<br> the way it should.<br> - Holes in my bones, or so they tell me.<br> - I don't see any holes.<br> You know something, miss?<br> Neither do I.<br> Would you like me to take your leis,<br> put them in a cool place?<br> They'll keep better.<br> Now, that's just about the smartest idea<br> anybody ever had.<br> Gotta keep them as long as we can.<br> Gotta get back<br> to the old salt mines tomorrow.<br> Get the nose to the grindstone.<br> That's Hawaiian for "thank you. "<br> Let me tell you something.<br> If we get into any trouble,<br> any serious trouble<br> that the pilot can't handle,<br> you just come to old Ed Joseph.<br> I'll be glad to go up there and help him<br> if he needs me.<br> - Got it?<br> - Got it.<br> All right, young man,<br> it's time to get you buckled down now.<br> Just make you nice and comfy here.<br> And the next thing you know<br> we'll be in the air, all right?<br> - Mind if I sit next to you during takeoff?<br> - I would be so pleased.<br> I am so happy<br> you wish to sit next to me,<br> because I have been watching you<br> walk down the aisle<br> and have the desire<br> to say a thing to you.<br> It is that you are<br> the first real, alive American girl<br> I have ever greeted in person.<br> You are so very beautiful.<br> I fear I shall feel terribly the ugly one<br> if all the girls in America<br> are so beautiful and kind.<br> I don't think you're going to<br> have to worry about a thing.<br> Off.<br> - Wing flaps.<br> - Fifteen degrees.<br> - Mixture.<br> - Auto rich.<br> V1 and V2 speeds?<br> - Check the radios, Dan?<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay, Lennie, let's deliver your tray.<br> When you have time, I wish you'd come<br> back and talk to one of my passengers.<br> All right.<br> He's a Mr Pardee,<br> big rumpled-looking man,<br> sitting halfway back on the right side.<br> Alsop said he had something to do<br> with the New York theatre.<br> I suppose he wants to put you<br> on the stage.<br> Call me<br> if you need your honour defended.<br> And jump from the frying pan<br> into the fire?<br> He's the original frightened Freddie.<br> Every time you bank or change<br> propeller pitch, he goes all white.<br> Grabs on his seat<br> like it was an electric chair.<br> Okay.<br> I thought you were<br> going to quit smoking.<br> I did. I haven't smoked<br> in three hours and 20 minutes.<br> Go ahead, stain your teeth.<br> Come see me when you grow up, junior.<br> What in the world are you<br> bawling about?<br> Have I done something to bring this on?<br> - Nell, cut it out.<br> - I'm trying to.<br> I just can't.<br> It's just, it's all over.<br> What's over?<br> Our honeymoon.<br> Doesn't that mean anything to you?<br> Of course it does. It's not over<br> for another 12 hours or so.<br> And it never has to be<br> as far as I'm concerned.<br> Oh, Milo.<br> I'm scared.<br> I'm just plain scared.<br> What are you scared of? We've got<br> the whole world in front of us.<br> It's just that we're so young.<br> And just like you said,<br> we've got that whole big world<br> down there.<br> - And you know what?<br> - What?<br> We've got to face it.<br> I thought you had confidence in me.<br> Of course I do.<br> It's just that<br> all the rest of the people in the world<br> don't know you like I do.<br> Supposing I was going to have a baby<br> and you didn't have a job?<br> - You're not supposed...<br> - Suppose I was?<br> All right.<br> You're going to have a baby<br> and I haven't got a job,<br> there's no food in the apartment,<br> it's snowing outside,<br> and the sheriff's knocking on the door...<br> Look, I didn't mean it that way.<br> - Are you?<br> - Am I what?<br> Are you...<br> You know.<br> - Me?<br> - You.<br> Oh, Milo. No.<br> Whatever gave you such an idea?<br> I don't know.<br> Prof. Flaherty. Welcome.<br> Are we to believe<br> you are at last resolved<br> to abandon the arts<br> and return to science?<br> If so, we rejoice.<br> We have sorely missed your help<br> and advice.<br> You're doing all right.<br> You'll find out how to blow up the world<br> all by your little selves.<br> It won't be long now and blooie.<br> Congratulations.<br> Professor, we all appreciate the fact<br> that you've been under enormous strain.<br> We deeply regret<br> that a man of your calibre<br> no longer sees fit to cooperate with us.<br> Cooperate?<br> I had a seat on a nice little campus<br> even if I wasn't making much money,<br> or my students didn't know<br> what I was talking about.<br> And I played pretty good golf<br> and I slept nights.<br> I was happy because I figured<br> it was still God's business<br> to monkey around with the universe.<br> He can fix a star<br> so it'll burn for a billion years.<br> Keep going and you'll find out<br> how to burn one up in a minute.<br> Did any of you ever bother<br> to look at the lagoon out there?<br> It's beautiful and blue,<br> and the people around it<br> are brown and kind<br> and they did know<br> how to laugh and sing.<br> Only now all the fishes<br> in the lagoon are dead.<br> And the people are scared forever.<br> They don't sing anymore.<br> You found a way to blow out a window<br> Only, suppose there's a mother<br> standing in that window<br> with a baby in her arms?<br> Professor,<br> I suggest you go to your tent<br> and rest for a while.<br> I'll arrange transport back to the States<br> for you at the earliest possible moment.<br> Yeah, do that.<br> I want to find a shepherd in the hills<br> or a mountain in the mist,<br> and paint their picture<br> before it's too late.<br> So, you'll please forgive me<br> another question, Captain.<br> Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?<br> I've made almost 200 flights<br> across here<br> and I feel a lot safer<br> than if I were driving my car.<br> I've got a lovely wife and two kids,<br> another on the way.<br> I wouldn't be doing this<br> if I didn't think it was safe.<br> You hedged, Captain.<br> You didn't answer my question.<br> Come now,<br> be a good honest fellow<br> and tell me exactly what frightened you?<br> They were technical incidents. I don't<br> think you'd understand, Mr Pardee.<br> I understand perfectly.<br> For some reason,<br> you were afraid you wouldn't reach<br> your Biblical span of life.<br> Which is precisely what's bothering me<br> at the moment.<br> I'm convinced I couldn't swim<br> from here to the nearest shore.<br> You won't have to swim, Mr Pardee.<br> Suppose one of your motors<br> ceases to function?<br> We'd just go back to Honolulu. These<br> ships fly beautifully on three engines.<br> If it should happen<br> beyond our point of no return<br> we'd simply continue<br> on to San Francisco.<br> Suppose two of your motors<br> became uninterested in further toil?<br> Each engine is entirely independent<br> of the other.<br> The chances of two quitting during the<br> same flight are one in several million.<br> Even if that should happen,<br> we could still fly,<br> lower and much slower,<br> but we'd get there.<br> You are very reassuring.<br> Why is it I read about so many crashes?<br> The newspapers always exaggerate<br> the importance of an air accident.<br> It would be very important to me<br> if I were in one.<br> You won't be, Mr Pardee.<br> Just relax. Enjoy your flight.<br> Please, Captain. I'd like to talk to you<br> for just a minute.<br> It can only be a minute,<br> then I'll have to go back to work.<br> I'm afraid I'm going to embarrass you.<br> I used to work in reservations<br> for Pan American.<br> That's fine. I'm glad you decided<br> to try a flight with us.<br> Aren't there two exits to this plane?<br> One up forward,<br> where you<br> and the rest of the crew leave?<br> Yes.<br> Could I leave the plane that way?<br> With you and the crew?<br> Please, it's very important to me.<br> It's not what you're thinking.<br> I am going to be met in San Francisco,<br> but not by the police or anybody else<br> who could get you into trouble.<br> It just wouldn't work.<br> Confused, Captain?<br> Why, no. That's you.<br> It was me, eight years ago.<br> A fellow in the States saw that picture.<br> He wrote me.<br> I was lonely, so I answered.<br> There were a lot of letters,<br> beautiful letters.<br> And then last month,<br> I agreed to marry him.<br> I never got around to telling him<br> the picture was eight years old.<br> I don't want to bore you<br> with my troubles,<br> but that dream kept me sane<br> for a long time.<br> I know I'm a<br> mess.<br> I'm so much older than he thinks I am.<br> But<br> if I could just see him<br> and then leave without meeting him.<br> Please understand, Captain.<br> What you're asking<br> is not exactly in my line.<br> Let me think it over. I'll let you know.<br> - Newspaper?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - How's AT&T?<br> - It's up a point.<br> I hope you don't mind,<br> I couldn't help watching you.<br> You remind me so much of a man<br> I once knew.<br> My name is Ken Childs<br> and I don't mind at all.<br> Fourteen minutes behind<br> on the last fix, Skipper.<br> So?<br> We should make it up.<br> The wind seems to be shifting around.<br> Good.<br> You know it's nice having<br> a guy like Dan Roman up here.<br> For a change,<br> I don't feel like a grandfather.<br> I was just saying to my wife<br> the other day,<br> I never had it so good.<br> Easy job, no strain,<br> and I'm pretty lucky in having<br> a girl like Susie.<br> It makes all the difference in the world<br> what kind of a wife a guy has.<br> Don't you think so, Skipper?<br> Now, you take a girl like my Susie.<br> I guess a lot of people<br> do think it's funny,<br> because I do the dishes<br> and the cooking, too,<br> but they forget<br> how much younger Susie is than I am.<br> And as for an extra martini<br> once in a while...<br> And so you'll please forgive me<br> another question, Captain.<br> Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?<br> ...it's spirit.<br> You know, she once called me...<br> Are you?<br> Are you now, for no reason at all...<br> You wait till you see what she does<br> with that hardwood tray I bought her.<br> ...after almost 2 million miles...<br> ...maybe beside the little bar<br> she bought...<br> ...afraid?<br> ...to keep herself company<br> while I'm away.<br> She'll show it to everyone<br> who drops in<br> to keep her company when I'm away.<br> But it's there.<br> It's like a heavy bundle in your belly.<br> You can almost touch it.<br> She spent most of her time<br> riding around in it<br> so she wouldn't get too lonesome.<br> Guess she drove a little too fast...<br> It's come like it has to so many others<br> for no reason at all...<br> And besides...<br> ...except maybe the wear and tear<br> of those 2 million miles.<br> ...because they look like they're going<br> faster than they really are.<br> Like what the bartender told me<br> last December<br> when she was picked up<br> for being drunk in and about...<br> They'll give you a certificate<br> for those 2 million miles<br> to hang on a wall at home.<br> Only, the certificate doesn't add up<br> to the wear and tear.<br> ...but the wrong word.<br> It's spirit she's got.<br> Dan knows about it.<br> All the old timers say<br> it's only temporary,<br> like growing pains.<br> Like this note she left me<br> on my last trip.<br> And now, it's here for no reason at all,<br> and you've got to fight it,<br> all alone.<br> "Welcome home, fatso.<br> "Got sleepy and couldn't wait<br> so you take a taxi.<br> "Don't make any racket when you come<br> home banging around the kitchen,<br> "and don't wake me up<br> in the morning. Love, Susie. "<br> What a sense of humour.<br> Someday, they're going to invent<br> a stool for navigators<br> that'll come somewhere near<br> fitting the human frame.<br> Ask Hobie if he can't synchronise<br> the props a little better.<br> I don't know<br> whether it's Number 1 or Number 3,<br> but one of them keeps slipping out.<br> It's getting on my nerves.<br> Okay.<br> Skipper says,<br> "What's the matter with you?<br> "Can't you keep the props together?"<br> They are together.<br> Skipper says they're out of phase.<br> One and 2 are as smooth as silk.<br> - So are 3 and 4.<br> - So be it.<br> The boys say the props<br> couldn't be smoother.<br> Yeah?<br> Well, there's something haywire.<br> Are you all right, Mr Briscoe?<br> All right?<br> Little girl,<br> I'm getting along like $10 million.<br> Can I get you something?<br> Perhaps a cup of tea<br> would taste good to you.<br> - What was that?<br> - It's 5:00.<br> - You mean it chimes?<br> - You heard it.<br> Funny thing. It happens to be<br> the last possession<br> I haven't signed over to someone else.<br> I wish it would chime again.<br> What a wonderful way<br> to keep track of the time.<br> If I had a watch like this, I couldn't wait<br> for the next hour to come,<br> and then the next one.<br> You know something?<br> I used to feel the same way.<br> But right now I'm in no hurry<br> for the hours to pass.<br> No, the watch is yours.<br> I want you to have it.<br> - I couldn't think of accepting it.<br> - Please.<br> A watch is the last thing<br> I'm going to need.<br> I'd like to think of it<br> marking the kind of hours<br> only a young girl can have,<br> exciting hours.<br> You'll make me very happy<br> if you'll accept it.<br> Well, if you put it that way.<br> I can't thank you.<br> I've never met anyone like you,<br> yet I shall remember you<br> for the rest of my life.<br> I'd rather you remember<br> it's only a possession<br> and so, not worth very much.<br> I will, always.<br> We can hear it chime together again,<br> it needs setting, you know.<br> - It's 7:00 in San Francisco.<br> - Sure. I forgot.<br> Is it really 7:00, little girl?<br> As far as this aeroplane is concerned.<br> Then you know something?<br> I don't want tea or coffee.<br> - A glass of water?<br> - Water is for bathing,<br> but if you can put some Scotch in it,<br> I'll feel cleaner.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - It's way past my cocktail time.<br> - Right now.<br> How about my friend over there?<br> Will you join me for a drink, mister?<br> Yes, thank you very much.<br> That's awful nice music.<br> We picked up four minutes, Skipper.<br> Looks like that wind<br> is finally swinging around now.<br> Good.<br> I may pass a miracle<br> and hit San Francisco right on time.<br> - Have a Lifesaver, Skipper?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Let me know, will you, when we pass<br> the point of no return?<br> Naturally.<br> Lydia, if you're through pouting,<br> maybe we could try talking things over<br> in a reasonable manner.<br> We have nothing to talk over.<br> Anyone who would sell<br> a New York advertising agency<br> - for a broken-down mine in Canada...<br> - It isn't broken.<br> ...just to make yourself feel important,<br> the big operator.<br> Operating on my money.<br> I just want to get up with the feeling<br> that anything I accomplish that day<br> is due to my own efforts.<br> Not because my wife happened<br> to inherit a business.<br> In three years I should be able<br> to pay you back. Every penny.<br> Three years in the wilderness<br> and I'd be a genuine country bumpkin<br> with my skirts around my ankles<br> when they ought to be around my knees<br> or the other way around.<br> For the last time, Lydia,<br> I'm asking you to come with me.<br> I'm glad it's the last time you're going<br> to make that insane request<br> so I won't have to say no again.<br> I'm getting a divorce as fast as I can.<br> You're out of your head.<br> What am I supposed to do<br> while you clump around<br> in your boots and lumberjack shirt?<br> Have cocktails with the chipmunks?<br> Play bridge with the Eskimos?<br> Go on off to your primeval forest.<br> Play Daniel Boone,<br> get up with the pigeons or whatever<br> kind of birds they have up there.<br> Get calluses on your hands.<br> Be a great<br> dirt-under-the-fingernails boy.<br> Make fire by friction. Eat out of cans.<br> Take a bath Saturday nights<br> and go to an Eskimo hoedown.<br> Teach them to samba, for all I care.<br> Do just as you please<br> if it will make you feel like a man.<br> Only don't ask me to share<br> your juvenile adventures.<br> It's bad enough having to pay for them.<br> - Is that your last word?<br> - No.<br> I've always felt your brain<br> would fit nicely in a demitasse.<br> Hey, fella.<br> You got nothing but trouble, right?<br> - I assure you...<br> - I know what you're going to say,<br> everything with you is hunky-dory.<br> That's the first thing a fella<br> in trouble always says.<br> The booby hatches are full of people<br> that keep things to themselves,<br> either because they're scared<br> to tell them the truth,<br> thinking they'll make a monkey<br> out of themselves,<br> or they figure no one else can<br> appreciate the situation they're in.<br> Okay?<br> Well, the Good Neighbours<br> believe that ain't so.<br> - And just who...<br> - A club I belong to back home.<br> It's like the Alcoholics Anonymous.<br> Their luncheons are a riot.<br> Over the speaker's desk,<br> they've got a great big towel<br> with the letters "For Crying Out Loud"<br> embroidered on it.<br> And every member<br> has his own crying towel, get it?<br> When they bring in a bad case,<br> a couple of the Good Neighbours<br> hold the towel for the fella<br> so he can concentrate on weeping,<br> and then don't have to exert himself<br> in any other way.<br> It turns out to be a good<br> old-fashioned revival meeting<br> and the fella who has<br> no particular worries at the time,<br> he sort of feels left out of things.<br> And if this fella don't actually wind up<br> laughing at himself,<br> at least he feels better.<br> The main thing is, everybody does,<br> because nine times out of 10,<br> they think they're better off<br> than the other fella.<br> What do you sing at the end<br> of your meetings?<br> Pack Up Your Troubles<br> in Your Old Kit Bag?<br> How'd you guess?<br> When a fella comes in<br> with real trouble,<br> like he can't pay his income taxes,<br> or his wife just smashed up the car,<br> or his new house<br> shows cracks along the foundation,<br> they've got an organ that plays<br> real sad music.<br> It's a kick.<br> I can see how it might be.<br> Of course, a fella never comes in<br> with real troubles.<br> You know, like,<br> the guy's wife dying,<br> or his business really going broke.<br> They just confess little problems,<br> like who are they gonna get<br> to mow the lawn,<br> or will they ever break 100<br> on the golf course?<br> It's all relative, see.<br> You get the habit of laughing<br> at little problems<br> when they come along,<br> and then you don't blow your top<br> when the genuine,<br> serious things happen. Get it?<br> Yes, I'm beginning to follow you, Mr...<br> Ed Joseph. I sell furniture.<br> Getting back to your case,<br> maybe it'd make you feel better<br> if I cried some.<br> Then you'd understand<br> what the Good Neighbour means.<br> Imagine yourself with a towel.<br> Ready?<br> The wife and I scrimped<br> for over four years<br> to take a trip to Hawaii.<br> You know, palm trees, sunshine, sand,<br> things we ain't got at home.<br> We dreamed of the day<br> that we were to leave.<br> So, the wife persuades a woman<br> to take care of our children<br> for $10 a day,<br> which is more than I made<br> the first five years we were married.<br> We got all unpacked<br> and were really living,<br> but the ship don't sail.<br> Strike or something.<br> But all right, we're lucky. We get<br> the last two tickets on an aeroplane,<br> and although we can't take<br> all our luggage,<br> we're in the land of our dreams.<br> At the little hotel that fits our budget,<br> there's a mix-up in the reservations.<br> Another couple named Joseph<br> from Milwaukee.<br> So we figure<br> maybe they've had a dream, too.<br> So we don't start any arguments.<br> We finally wind up at a hotel<br> which is way beyond our budget.<br> So we have to cut our trip short.<br> Okay? Comes evening,<br> the wife gets into the one evening dress<br> she could bring along<br> and I get into a tux<br> I haven't had on in 10 years.<br> Mommy!<br> We were ready for the light fantastic.<br> The wife was wearing new shoes<br> with heels much higher<br> than she was used to and...<br> My back.<br> The house doctor says the wife<br> has twisted her sacroiliac,<br> which ends the dancing for the trip.<br> So everything passes.<br> In a couple of days the wife is well<br> enough to hobble down to the beach.<br> It rains bullfrogs for three straight days.<br> All we got to do is sit around<br> and write postcards back home<br> about what a wonderful time<br> we're having.<br> Three days we got left,<br> then we meet the Wilsons.<br> One of the pleasures of any trip<br> should be the people you meet, right?<br> The Wilsons had their own ideas<br> of what was fun.<br> He thought my wife was his dish,<br> and she thought I was Clark Gable.<br> The wife can't run very fast<br> on account of her sacroiliac.<br> I'm having my own track meet.<br> Fella, you have never lived<br> until you've been chased around<br> the palm tree by that guy's wife.<br> So we spend the rest of our dream trip<br> eating away from the hotel<br> so we don't run into these people<br> and have to play post office all the time.<br> But the last day the sun comes out.<br> Whoever heard of coming home<br> from a dream trip without a tan?<br> We're desperate, see?<br> We really soaked up that sun, all day.<br> The wife has a third-degree burn<br> on her shoulders.<br> I don't dare put any weight on my back.<br> I'm gonna have to borrow money<br> from the bank<br> to pay next month's food bill,<br> if we ever do get home.<br> If you still think you got troubles,<br> mister...<br> Wonder if you and Mrs Joseph<br> would care to join me in a drink?<br> You can have your towel back now.<br> Take a breather, Dan.<br> I'll turn the knobs awhile.<br> Good, I could use a little shuteye.<br> Funny thing how a fella can sleep with<br> four big engines hollering in his ears,<br> only wake up when they stop hollering.<br> Imagine silence<br> waking you up at home?<br> No human being should have to put up<br> with such an arrangement.<br> San Francisco tollsman, 2930.<br> I don't care if you did build<br> that radio yourself.<br> It's against the law.<br> Throw it overboard before I do.<br> But I like to listen to the aeroplanes.<br> I spent a long time building that set.<br> You touch my set and I'll kill you.<br> I might do it anyway.<br> Just to have something happen<br> on this rust bucket.<br> You're going off your rocker.<br> You need six months ashore.<br> Being shipmates with you is enough<br> to drive anybody off their rocker.<br> Get out of here.<br> Don't say I didn't warn you.<br> The FCC will jerk your licence<br> in a minute<br> if you send anything on that pile of junk.<br> Get out of here.<br> Hello, Honolulu.<br> This is 420 with a position report.<br> Come on, Honolulu. Wake up.<br> Answer him.<br> 420, this is San Francisco,<br> Honolulu unable to read you<br> on account of poor conditions.<br> Go ahead with your report.<br> Okay, San Francisco. Copy, Honolulu.<br> Position at 0557.<br> Latitude 34/30 north.<br> Longitude 140 west, 9,000 feet.<br> 1,500 gallons remaining.<br> From the window at my side,<br> sometimes I can see the stars.<br> America is all around me in every way.<br> Do you understand a funny thing?<br> In Honolulu, I must be inspected<br> by the American customs<br> and immigration persons.<br> And not one soldier to guard things.<br> I look everywhere for soldiers<br> with guns and...<br> Would you like your dinner now,<br> Miss Chen?<br> Yes. Please, I am so stupid.<br> Here is a letter to my brother in English<br> and I cannot remember this word.<br> It is that thing soldiers wear<br> at the end of their guns,<br> like a sword?<br> - Bayonet?<br> - Yes.<br> I am so very stupid. Thank you.<br> I am embarrassed.<br> Anyone who can write and read<br> more than one language<br> should never be embarrassed.<br> Being the original dumb-bunny,<br> I can barely write my own.<br> "Dumb-bunny"?<br> That's slang for mentally-retarded<br> American girls like me.<br> Dumb-bunny.<br> How delightful.<br> I must tell my brother of this.<br> You tell him you met the number one<br> stupid rabbit.<br> If he knows any American girls,<br> he'll understand.<br> Now I'll get your dinner.<br> Dumb-bunny.<br> There's something very wrong<br> back there. The tray...<br> - I know.<br> - A whole tray jumped.<br> - I burned myself.<br> - I swear it's that Number 1 engine.<br> It was running perfectly. They all are.<br> Maybe it's in the tail. If our little girl got<br> burned, maybe it's worse back there.<br> Dan, take your flashlight,<br> have a look through the tail.<br> - Report to me as soon as you can.<br> - Right.<br> Leonard, take a fast fix,<br> let me know our position now<br> and every 10 minutes from now.<br> Spalding, get back to your passengers.<br> If this thing lets go again,<br> they'll start wondering.<br> Hobie, tell San Francisco<br> we're experiencing<br> some unusual vibration<br> and to stand by until further advised.<br> Do you want to declare an emergency?<br> No, not yet.<br> - Is everything all right?<br> - We're still in one piece.<br> I was just starting to serve<br> the passengers. Should I go ahead?<br> You might as well.<br> Sometimes these things<br> never do get explained.<br> Say, hang up a minute, will you?<br> Tell me what's wrong<br> with this aeroplane.<br> - Is there something wrong with it?<br> - Cut it out.<br> Something popped so hard a while ago,<br> it spilled my drink.<br> Order another. We're not stingy.<br> You won't talk?<br> I would if there was anything to say.<br> I'll make you a bet right now,<br> we're late getting into San Francisco.<br> Could be.<br> - Did you find anything?<br> - Nope.<br> - What do you suppose it could it be?<br> - Beats me. Where are we?<br> I'll let you know in a couple of minutes.<br> Nothing wrong with the tail.<br> The Number 1 head temperature has<br> gone up five degrees in the past hour.<br> San Francisco wants to know<br> the nature of our trouble.<br> Tell them if we knew,<br> we'd have told them.<br> No, don't say that. Tell them...<br> Just say we still don't know<br> and to keep standing by.<br> I got news for you guys.<br> We just passed the point of no return.<br> - Have you lost something, Mr Agnew?<br> - My lighter is out of fluid.<br> Maybe he thinks he's aboard ship<br> and is trying to work up an appetite<br> for dinner.<br> I seen a crazy man act like that once.<br> It ain't so nice.<br> He's looking for trouble.<br> You're Kenneth Childs, aren't you?<br> Well, isn't that your name?<br> Yeah. Why?<br> I don't think we've met before.<br> No. We've not met<br> because no one wanted us to.<br> What can I do for you?<br> My name is Humphrey Agnew.<br> Well, does that mean anything to you?<br> - Agnew. You're Martha's husband.<br> - I am.<br> I didn't hear you say<br> you were pleased to meet me.<br> - Of course...<br> - Of course not!<br> Look, Mr Agnew, this lady and I<br> are having a quiet drink together.<br> You seem to be disturbed<br> about something.<br> Perhaps we can talk later.<br> If you'll excuse...<br> No, you don't just snap your fingers<br> and send me on my way.<br> Mr Agnew, I don't know what's<br> eating you, and frankly, I don't care.<br> Why don't you go back<br> wherever you came from and sit down.<br> - Now, honey.<br> - This man's a nuisance.<br> I've no doubt I'm a nuisance.<br> I must have been<br> an even greater nuisance<br> when you and my wife were scheming<br> to avoid me in Honolulu,<br> - so you could be alone.<br> - You're right out of your head.<br> I took your wife to lunch twice<br> because she was a very nice girl.<br> And a long time ago<br> she happened to work for me.<br> The worst crime she is guilty of<br> is shaking my hand.<br> Now stop insulting her<br> and making a fool of yourself. Beat it.<br> I knew you'd have<br> some fancy explanation.<br> But I'm not such a fool<br> as you and my wife think I am.<br> I'm going to let you wonder<br> what I'm going to do.<br> Wonder and think and think,<br> as I've been doing.<br> I've heard about you for years<br> and I'm sick of the sound of your name.<br> You're quite a conqueror<br> with the ladies, aren't you?<br> That should interest you, madam.<br> - I've had enough of this.<br> - What's the matter with you guys?<br> - Hey, what's this all about?<br> - Easy, break it up.<br> He's crazy, he's got a gun.<br> We're on fire!<br> - Pull the bottle on it.<br> - Hobie, pull the bottle quick!<br> - Get on the radio. Tell San Francisco.<br> - San Francisco 420.<br> The prop! The whole prop is gone.<br> Yes, and you may lose your engine, too.<br> - She's off her mountings.<br> - Pull the other bottle, Dan.<br> - I'm starting for the water.<br> - San Francisco 420.<br> Thank you, sweet Lord.<br> I don't think she's gonna burn any more.<br> I can't raise San Francisco. Static.<br> - Try the secondary frequency.<br> - I've tried both.<br> Use emergency.<br> Give them a mayday call.<br> - Are we going into the water?<br> - No.<br> She flies lousy<br> with that engine hanging down,<br> but I think we can stay in the air.<br> - How long to the coast?<br> - Six hours, about.<br> But at regular cruising speed. I've not<br> figured it out for this sort of thing.<br> Figure it!<br> ...mayday 420.<br> Mayday 420, anybody.<br> I got somebody. A ship.<br> This is the Cristobal Trader calling 420.<br> I can hear you very clearly.<br> You passed right over me<br> about 20 minutes ago.<br> Do you want me to relay<br> all your messages? Over.<br> Roger. Advise San Francisco<br> we've lost Number 1 propeller.<br> Fire started but is now out.<br> We are now at 5,000, but sinking.<br> Request they clear<br> all altitudes below us. Over.<br> Will do. Stand by.<br> This is Cristobal Trader<br> calling San Francisco.<br> Clear sea rescue from Oakland Control.<br> Right.<br> Warm up the ready plane. Intercept.<br> San Francisco wants to know<br> if you are going to ditch. Over.<br> Negative for now.<br> What's the state of the sea<br> about you, just in case. Over.<br> Heavy northwest swells.<br> We are rolling about 30 degrees.<br> It's very rough.<br> Keep that ship in the air if you can, boy.<br> It's wet down here. Over.<br> Thank you, Cristobal Trader. We'll try.<br> Attaboy, papa.<br> Some of these days, I'm gonna<br> get smart and go back to buttons.<br> - What's the poop?<br> - Eastbound lost a prop.<br> Had a fire but that's out.<br> Looks like he's headed for the drink.<br> - How far out is he?<br> -1,000 miles maybe.<br> My aching eyes!<br> This might well be my last show<br> and not a laugh in it.<br> I shouldn't have screamed,<br> but I was so scared.<br> My own heart is just returning<br> from the ceiling.<br> Troubles? Wait till I tell<br> the Good Neighbours about this.<br> I was almost asleep when someone<br> pulled the champagne cork.<br> This could become interesting.<br> Things were pretty interesting<br> before this happened.<br> Two apes were trying to kill each other.<br> Why don't you be a good boy<br> and go back and sit down.<br> I'm sure everything will be all right.<br> They'll come back from the flight deck<br> and explain in a minute.<br> I'm just gonna keep this for you<br> till we make San Francisco.<br> You can get in plenty trouble<br> with them things.<br> I'll get coffee for everyone.<br> Did you know space guns don't kill you?<br> No.<br> They just make you stiff.<br> You know, the funny part of all this,<br> is that for the first time<br> in my whole life, I'm innocent.<br> What I told him was the truth,<br> so help me.<br> This is gonna cost the taxpayers<br> a lot of money.<br> What would you have them do?<br> Swim home?<br> No Alameda, this is the Coast Guard<br> Rescue Coordination Centre.<br> - New position, Skipper!<br> - Name it!<br> To the coast, 5 hours, 47 minutes,<br> if we can hold this air speed.<br> - How's our fuel?<br> - Enough. Just.<br> We'll only need about 1,150 gallons,<br> we've 1,300 according to my graph.<br> - It's pinching things close...<br> - You can throw your graph away.<br> - Because we haven't got 1,300 gallons.<br> - How do you figure that?<br> The Number 1 tank. It read 200 gallons<br> when we lost our prop.<br> My guess is that when the prop left us,<br> it kicked holes in the wing.<br> Ruptured the tank.<br> We just can't make it this way.<br> I'll figure it up again, but the winds,<br> - maybe they'll change some.<br> - We're going into the drink.<br> It's just a question of when and where.<br> We've got plenty of time. Let's not rush<br> off into the heat of the day about this.<br> Let's hold on a while<br> and see what the wind does.<br> - We'll be closer to the coast.<br> - Water will be colder there.<br> And probably rougher, but I still think we<br> should stretch it out as long as we can.<br> I'll go along with you on that.<br> It'll give us more time<br> to get squared away.<br> I want you up here with me<br> when we really start down.<br> Meantime get everything<br> you can overboard.<br> Thousand pounds or so<br> will make a difference in our speed.<br> You want me to tell them<br> they're going into the drink?<br> Use your own judgement.<br> I guess I don't have to tell you people<br> that we've had a little trouble.<br> Maybe if I explain<br> exactly what has happened,<br> you'll feel better all around.<br> I'm not gonna minimise it,<br> nor will I make it any tougher<br> than it really is.<br> We've lost our Number 1 propeller.<br> This is just one of those things<br> that never happens but does<br> once in a billion flying miles.<br> We've extinguished the fire<br> with the carbon dioxide,<br> so there's no further danger from that.<br> But our speed has been considerably<br> slowed down<br> because the Number 1 motor<br> is partially twisted in its mountings,<br> causing a severe drag,<br> sort of like dragging your feet<br> in a rowboat.<br> I can't blame you<br> if you are a little scared, I am, too.<br> I've been flying since 1917<br> and I don't like this sort of thing<br> any better than you do.<br> However, with all that flying,<br> you'll notice that<br> I'm still very much alive.<br> Now comes the hard part.<br> - Can you take it?<br> - Please, tell us everything.<br> I think we all want to know.<br> We're really very lucky.<br> That propeller could have done<br> a great deal more damage.<br> Anyway, there are several holes in<br> the wing, that's where our fuel is stored.<br> Which means that we can't quite make<br> the California coast.<br> Can't we go back to Honolulu?<br> We'd already past the point<br> of no return when it happened.<br> We will probably have to ditch<br> this plane in the sea.<br> We'll all be killed.<br> There's just a chance that you'll only be<br> in the water a few minutes.<br> There's a rescue plane<br> already on its way to intercept us.<br> Before we actually have to go in<br> there'll probably be several more.<br> Some of which can land on water.<br> And surface vessels<br> will be directed toward us.<br> Aeroplanes have gone<br> into the water before<br> and no one received the slightest injury,<br> except maybe a little dampening.<br> Casualties come from panic.<br> So you must not hurry.<br> Miss Spalding and our second officer,<br> Mr Wheeler, will be back here with you.<br> Do exactly as they tell you.<br> Aeroplanes have been known to float<br> for so long that<br> they became a menace to navigation<br> and had to be sunk by gunfire.<br> They've been known to sink<br> in a few minutes, too.<br> This is an inflatable life raft.<br> It's really a wonderful gadget.<br> It's got everything in it<br> but T-bone steaks.<br> It will hold all of you very comfortably.<br> Mr Wheeler, our second officer,<br> will be in charge.<br> He will tell you<br> when to take off your shoes.<br> We don't want anybody kicking holes<br> in this raft.<br> Miss Spalding will show you<br> where the emergency rations are,<br> when you get hungry.<br> How're we gonna get hungry if we're<br> only gonna be in the raft a few minutes?<br> Aren't you giving us a lot of malarkey?<br> Maybe a little,<br> but we just don't want bad things said<br> about the service<br> and cuisine on this airline.<br> No doubt there'll be caviar.<br> It would be most arduous<br> if there were no caviar.<br> I'll speak to the emergency chef.<br> I don't think<br> this is anything to joke about.<br> You're wrong.<br> The more jokes, the better.<br> When you get in that raft,<br> you might even try singing.<br> I was once a fair-to-middling bass.<br> I can't carry a tune in a basket,<br> but I'm sure loud.<br> Now, this is very important.<br> When we actually go in,<br> there will be two shocks.<br> If you know about them in advance,<br> they won't frighten you.<br> The first will be hardly noticeable,<br> like a normal landing.<br> But the second may be quite severe,<br> so brace yourselves.<br> Soon after that, the lights will go out,<br> but Miss Spalding and Mr Wheeler<br> both have flashlights.<br> So unfasten your seat belts<br> and wait for his call.<br> And keep calm.<br> Now, is there anything<br> you don't understand?<br> Could we send a radio message<br> to our families?<br> They were gonna meet us at the airport.<br> They will be standing.<br> I'm sorry, our radio is extremely busy<br> giving our position<br> and contacting the rescue plane.<br> I've some important papers<br> in my briefcase, many years of work.<br> Can I take them with me?<br> Not unless you can stuff them<br> in your pockets.<br> No baggage of any kind.<br> Come to think about it,<br> the bottom of the sea<br> is the best place for them.<br> And one thing more.<br> Now, don't get your hopes up.<br> There is one chance in a thousand<br> that we can make the coast.<br> This isn't possible unless there is<br> a marked change in the wind.<br> And according to our forecast,<br> it just couldn't happen.<br> But it could. And the one thing<br> we can do right now to help matters<br> is to lighten ship.<br> That way we'll use slightly less fuel.<br> If any of you gentlemen have ever had<br> an urge to throw things out of windows,<br> this is your chance of a lifetime.<br> What about us girls?<br> I love to throw things.<br> Good, go back and help Miss Spalding.<br> I'd better stick with the wife. She's<br> awfully worried about our children.<br> Please, let me help.<br> I'll sue the airline for this,<br> I'm not supposed to exert myself.<br> - The doctor says my heart...<br> - Your heart is breaking my heart.<br> We can get rid of some of this baggage<br> if you gentlemen will come with me,<br> and the rest of you<br> form a line clear back to the door.<br> My new Mainbocher frock is in here.<br> The insurance company<br> isn't gonna like this.<br> What a wonderful excuse<br> to get a new wardrobe.<br> Be kind of nice<br> if he came through all this<br> and didn't know a thing about it.<br> I need a big man.<br> Interested?<br> - Fascinated.<br> - Grab me around the waist.<br> All right, start kicking things out,<br> but be careful.<br> Keep behind me,<br> it's lonesome out there.<br> That does it.<br> Now all we have to do is wait.<br> Excuse me.<br> My kids, they like to hear me play this.<br> - Aren't you coming back to our seat?<br> - I'm staying here.<br> I can't stand that crying towel.<br> Hobie, give me 2,250 rpm.<br> Crack the cowl flaps.<br> Watch those head temperatures.<br> Give me another inch of boost!<br> Look at the fuel, Skipper,<br> the flow meters, we're pouring it in.<br> I can't help it. This turbulence is slowing<br> us down and we can't climb out of it!<br> Have a cup of coffee.<br> - I'm plenty hot enough now.<br> - Then it will cool you off.<br> Of course you're worried, Mrs Joseph.<br> But I'm quite certain<br> we'll get out of this all right.<br> By tomorrow we can look back on it<br> as an interesting experience.<br> By the by, how old are your children?<br> Jennifer is six and Edward is four.<br> Jennifer is such a delightful name,<br> Mrs Joseph. How fortunate you are.<br> Jennifer has always brought to me<br> the suggestion of the Scottish moor,<br> heather, great peace,<br> and visions of little villages<br> nestled against the hills.<br> That sort of thing.<br> Is your Jennifer anything like that?<br> I don't know exactly what you mean,<br> but she's always been a quiet child.<br> Precisely.<br> Somehow I knew your Jennifer<br> would be like that.<br> And Edward, I've no doubt, is growing<br> so fast you can't buy shoes for him.<br> Every three weeks.<br> Why don't you try to rest now?<br> Later I'd like to hear<br> a great deal more about your children.<br> I thought you hated<br> the mere mention of children.<br> I do.<br> But that poor woman is terrified.<br> I think I helped her.<br> For 10 years you've said that<br> love was a word in the dictionary<br> and children were monsters.<br> And you would never go two inches<br> out of your way to help anybody.<br> What goes, Gustave?<br> I've never seen you this way.<br> You've forgotten yourself<br> for a whole hour.<br> You've been magnificent.<br> Exaggeration is a foolish indulgence.<br> You told that woman<br> we'd get out of this all right.<br> - Do you really believe that?<br> - No.<br> In spite of what that pilot said, I think<br> we're batting at a very sticky wicket.<br> - And yet you're not afraid?<br> - Yes and no.<br> I'm not sure just how I feel.<br> If I were openly afraid now,<br> some of the others might become so.<br> I was guilty of the cheapest theatrics<br> right after the fire<br> and now it seems, I'm stuck with it.<br> I just want to know one thing.<br> What happened to the biggest baby<br> in the world?<br> The child-man who was afraid to sleep<br> with the lights off.<br> You used to burst into tears<br> if the laundry put starch in your shirts,<br> or the crepe suzette was underdone.<br> I don't understand you, Gustave.<br> I guess I never will.<br> Maybe it isn't important<br> to understand you<br> like the other women<br> you've always managed to keep around.<br> I've tried to tell myself I made a bargain<br> with a throwback, a Roman emperor.<br> You bought me on the market, Gustave,<br> paid for me,<br> like you might pay for a play<br> which you thought might turn out well.<br> For 10 years I've lived with that thought<br> and hated it.<br> Now it'll never bother me again.<br> Gustave, there is something<br> I'd like to tell you.<br> And if we don't get out of this,<br> I'd like you to know it even more.<br> I've never said it before<br> and probably you'll never want me<br> to say it again.<br> What else is on your twisted little mind?<br> I'm in love with you, Gustave.<br> I guess I always have been.<br> And then you tie the ribbons like this.<br> These preservers are not inflated now.<br> If you jerk this cord on either side,<br> carbon dioxide will be released<br> from the capsules<br> and the vest will inflate immediately.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> - Any calls for me?<br> - Take your pick.<br> Boyd, public relations.<br> No, Tommy.<br> We've not lost an aeroplane.<br> I'm standing right here in Operations<br> and our plane is still in the air.<br> Yeah, we had a little trouble. No,<br> I don't know the passengers' names.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> Where's Garfield? This jerk newspaper<br> wants a statement from the manager.<br> He's on his way.<br> He'll be here any minute.<br> Boyd, public relations.<br> Listen, Oswald, this airline has flown<br> over 30 million passenger miles<br> without ever scratching a passenger.<br> Sure we want to cooperate.<br> You'll get the straight dope,<br> just give me time to get organised.<br> Goodbye.<br> Mr Garfield, can you give me a minute?<br> Just about. What's your trouble?<br> The papers are on my neck already.<br> What will I tell them?<br> How about "drop dead" for an opener?<br> - You know I can't do that.<br> - I know.<br> - How long can you stall them?<br> - I don't know, maybe an hour.<br> They're crying about morning editions.<br> An hour might be enough.<br> We've got real trouble.<br> Does it look that bad?<br> It don't look good.<br> Is everything all right with you two?<br> I don't know when I've felt better<br> in the last five years.<br> I've just elected Miss Chen as the girl I<br> would most like to be on a life raft with.<br> Of course, now,<br> she may prefer a younger man.<br> There is in my family a very old saying.<br> I will try to translate it for you.<br> "The youth of man will never die<br> "unless he murders it. "<br> I plead not guilty.<br> I just want to show you<br> how to use your life vest.<br> My neck won't stand any weight,<br> and my bones are only held together<br> by my imagination.<br> A burial at sea will save my heirs<br> a lot of money.<br> - I'm ashamed of you for talking like that.<br> - Why do that?<br> You just look more comfortable<br> that way, Mr Briscoe.<br> You impress me<br> as the open-collar type anyway.<br> Rugged, you know.<br> - Outdoorsy, you mean?<br> - Yes.<br> You behave yourself.<br> I'll be coming back to make sure<br> you're being nice to Miss Chen.<br> It's a rough assignment<br> for an outdoor man without his horse,<br> but I'll do my best.<br> Would you like<br> to put your vests on now?<br> Investigation will undoubtedly prove this<br> aeroplane was ready for the junk heap.<br> And we're in the hands of incompetents.<br> I don't want to make no trouble,<br> but why don't you shut up?<br> You hate me, don't you?<br> All of you hate me<br> because I tried to do what was right.<br> Do like the little lady says.<br> Don't touch me, please.<br> You're giving me a very bad time,<br> Mr Agnew. I'm only trying to help you.<br> I have a perfect right...<br> You got no rights at all<br> for some time to come.<br> Do like she says or no life vest<br> is gonna keep you from drowning<br> because I'm gonna hold your head<br> under till you stop wiggling.<br> If we should happen to go down,<br> I'll give you plenty of warning.<br> Cross your arms like this<br> right in front of your face.<br> Brace your hands<br> on the seat just ahead.<br> Bend your head down<br> between your arms,<br> and keep them there<br> until we've stopped completely.<br> Remember to remove your shoes.<br> You men should loosen<br> your collar and tie.<br> Why?<br> According to the ditching instructions,<br> there is less possibility<br> of breaking your neck.<br> Anything from 420?<br> Not a sound out of them, sir.<br> Those people,<br> if they have to ditch tonight<br> with the way that wind's<br> kicking up that sea,<br> they don't stand much of a chance,<br> I'm thinking.<br> Cristobal Trader from San Francisco.<br> We can work the aircraft clearly now.<br> Thanks for your help. Over.<br> Good. Muchas gracias.<br> Cristobal Trader over and out.<br> How about letting me take over<br> for a while? Save yourself for later.<br> - We'll need you.<br> - All right.<br> Hey, Skipper, it will be almost dry tanks.<br> Maybe 20 or 30 gallons left. But if the<br> winds are right we can make it.<br> We picked up four minutes<br> in the past hour. I figured it all out.<br> If we can pick up a total of 11 minutes,<br> we're safe.<br> Hey, Skipper,<br> the interceptor is calling us.<br> We estimate our position<br> at 145 miles east of you.<br> Expect interception<br> in approximately 20 minutes.<br> Get a bearing on him.<br> We will transmit every three minutes<br> from now on.<br> When your needle begins to<br> fluctuate rapidly, advise us immediately.<br> We will then be very close to you.<br> You should have a bearing by now.<br> How about it?<br> We're gonna make it.<br> Five degrees north of our course.<br> We're awful glad to know you're around.<br> We know what you mean.<br> Say, can you guys climb any higher?<br> Out of this stuff<br> interception would be a lot easier.<br> Negative. We can climb, but we don't<br> want to use the fuel to do it.<br> Every gallon's a mile nearer shore<br> for us.<br> Okay. We'll find you anyway.<br> - Are you still afraid?<br> - No, my darling.<br> I don't mean the aeroplane.<br> I mean us, our future.<br> I'm not afraid of anything now.<br> I can't hear you.<br> How could I ever be afraid<br> when you hold me like this?<br> - I love you.<br> - Darling.<br> No.<br> Just think where we are.<br> I'm thinking how awful it would be<br> if this was the last time<br> I could hold you so.<br> - We'll have years, all our lives.<br> - If this aeroplane makes it.<br> Careful, darling.<br> Howard.<br> I thought you weren't speaking to me.<br> Would you be sorry if I drowned?<br> - Don't be ridiculous.<br> - I have to know.<br> I'd be more than sorry.<br> You could go off to your North woods.<br> It's occurred to me<br> that trying to make a go at that mine<br> might turn out to be a bad dream.<br> But it is a dream, Howard, your dream.<br> It was.<br> I could switch things back.<br> I suppose that would please you.<br> I'd only lose you.<br> A few hours ago,<br> you insisted on getting rid of me.<br> At times I'm a very stupid<br> and selfish woman.<br> I think you should go up to your mine.<br> That's you.<br> And you might take me along for laughs.<br> I'm hearing things.<br> You'd be miserable.<br> No doubt.<br> But I want you.<br> The guy I had sense enough to marry.<br> If I choke on hotcakes, or try to put<br> evening gowns on the natives,<br> or have cocktails with the sled dogs,<br> you'll just have to be patient with me.<br> You don't have to, but I wish you would.<br> Mush! That's what you say<br> to a sled dog, isn't it?<br> I want to start practising.<br> Makes them turn left,<br> if you yell it loud enough.<br> You're very good.<br> - Can you get that through to Sullivan?<br> - I can try.<br> - Everything else buttoned up?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Any improvement in the local weather?<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> - Radar, anything yet?<br> - No target, sir.<br> Navigator, how's our position<br> for interception?<br> Dead on. Just got a loran fix.<br> We should be joining now,<br> if their navigator is anywhere near right.<br> - Radar?<br> - No target, sir.<br> - Somebody's wrong.<br> - We should be right on top of them.<br> We can easily miss this guy.<br> No target, sir.<br> That navigator's wacky.<br> We're already seven minutes overdue.<br> Radar?<br> Target, Skipper. Strong blip.<br> Four degrees left, eight miles.<br> Looks like he's 500 feet below us.<br> Made a mistake, didn't you, fatso?<br> What happened to the 11 minutes<br> you were counting on?<br> What happened to them, fatso?<br> You never could make them up,<br> you just thought you could.<br> - Lennie, what about it?<br> - Hang on, Skipper. I'm still checking.<br> Time's wasting, fatso. Stop shaking.<br> Find the minutes,<br> and you can come back to me.<br> Minutes.<br> Who's got the minutes?<br> Your Susie's got them, right here.<br> Come on, Lennie.<br> What's holding things up?<br> The Coast Guard says<br> your position's wrong.<br> I'll be right with you, Skipper.<br> Skipper?<br> I got bad news.<br> The Coast Guard was right.<br> I made a dumb kid's mistake.<br> We're not as close to the coast<br> as I thought we were.<br> I was figuring in knots instead of miles.<br> I guess I was just scared.<br> What about those 11 minutes?<br> They can make the difference<br> between the water and your own bed.<br> They aren't there.<br> They never were there.<br> I'm sorry, Skipper.<br> I hope this will float.<br> I am so excited about your arrival,<br> Sally.<br> Tomorrow, I'll leave these mountains<br> and pines, which will be your home, too,<br> and go down to the city<br> for my first visit in over a year.<br> I want to get there<br> a few days before you arrive,<br> because there are some things<br> this cabin needs<br> to make it more comfortable for a girl.<br> I'm still scared you won't like it up here,<br> unless you're nuts about<br> the sound of a mountain stream,<br> or love to watch the sun seem to turn<br> a mountain peak around very slow.<br> Hey, Henry.<br> One of our neighbours<br> just came by to say hello.<br> A little fawn I call Henry.<br> He seems to ask,<br> "Where is Sally? Where is your wife?"<br> So hurry, girl!<br> So you'll be sure to recognise me<br> at the airport,<br> I'll be wearing a bright green tie.<br> P.S. I was just thinking how lucky I am.<br> I happened to pick up<br> an old torn magazine<br> and there is your picture,<br> smacking me right between the eyes.<br> And only a short time later,<br> that very wonderful-looking little girl<br> is coming to share my life.<br> Remarkable.<br> What's so remarkable?<br> Is it faith or just habit<br> that compels a woman<br> to put on fresh makeup<br> before boarding a life raft?<br> Aren't you jumping the gun?<br> You're being a fatalist<br> about this business then?<br> I'm not sure I even know<br> what a fatalist is.<br> I'm not sure I even know<br> what a fatalist is.<br> How can you sit there so calmly then,<br> when a little while ago<br> you were terrified?<br> I sat down here with you because<br> I thought I might be able to help you.<br> But I'm not needed.<br> If you came over to give me help,<br> it was partly because<br> you needed help yourself,<br> very badly.<br> Don't worry about me.<br> I've just stopped worrying<br> about losing something<br> I never had a chance to get<br> in the first place.<br> Would the thing be a man?<br> Or am I getting too personal?<br> You are.<br> I don't care anymore.<br> I've been kidding myself long enough.<br> I'm not gonna run away anymore.<br> What are you hiding from?<br> Myself.<br> He's a kind, clean, wonderful man.<br> He has a right to know<br> what kind of a person I am.<br> I'm going to tell him<br> that I'm a different kind of person<br> than he thinks I am.<br> I'm not wonderful,<br> not kind, I'm not clean.<br> Telling you these things is easy,<br> because you're a stranger<br> and I'll never see you again.<br> Telling him is...<br> It's going to be one of the hardest things<br> I've ever done in my life,<br> 'cause in my heart,<br> I'll always see him<br> even when he turns his back<br> and walks away.<br> Look at my face.<br> Wouldn't you walk away?<br> I'm so much older<br> than my years have made me.<br> Look at my face carefully, as he'll do.<br> You'll see how very old I am.<br> I'm beat.<br> I'll make a swell-looking bride.<br> A beat bride.<br> But I'm not afraid anymore.<br> Now that I know what's going to happen,<br> I'm almost happy.<br> So, I wasn't making up my face<br> a few minutes ago.<br> I was looking in the mirror, at me.<br> Does that answer your question,<br> mister?<br> I was mistaken.<br> You aren't a fatalist.<br> You're a very courageous young lady.<br> Maybe some of it will brush off on me<br> if I keep sitting here.<br> Maybe I can throw a few things<br> out of my own life.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - No, thanks. I don't use them things.<br> - Do you have to do that?<br> - Yeah.<br> Could I have my property back now?<br> - Why?<br> - It would mean a great deal to me.<br> Take away this feeling<br> of being constantly watched.<br> I'm all right, now. Quite calm.<br> You can trust me.<br> Sit down.<br> You got lots to think about,<br> and maybe not so much time for to do it.<br> Holy Mary, mother of God,<br> pray for us sinners,<br> now and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br> Our Father, who art in Heaven,<br> hallowed be thy name.<br> Thy Kingdom come...<br> Sparks, get on the horn.<br> Advised interception completed at 56.<br> Okay, Dan. I'll take over.<br> Go back now. Take the Gibson girl,<br> get the passengers all set.<br> You'll have plenty of time.<br> Turn on the seat belt sign 10 minutes<br> before we start for the water.<br> Good luck, you guys.<br> - Anything new with the wind, Lennie?<br> - No.<br> We're not very fat, then?<br> - If we only had 11 minutes more of fuel.<br> - Eleven minutes? Is that all you need?<br> - Are you sure?<br> - I know exactly where we are now.<br> Eleven minutes more of fuel<br> would see us through.<br> What increase in wind velocity would<br> we need to arrange that little thing?<br> Twenty knots in the next hour.<br> - That's asking a lot.<br> - Yeah.<br> It couldn't happen so I'm not asking.<br> But if the wind swung around<br> a little more in the tail<br> it could be.<br> I guess they'll pick us up<br> before we get too damp.<br> Susie will sure be worried.<br> She'll lay down the law.<br> Probably insist I quit flying.<br> Will you?<br> No.<br> - Everything's here. I just hope it works.<br> - It will.<br> Wouldn't you rather<br> not have to depend on it?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Suppose we didn't ditch.<br> You've got to.<br> Lennie says all we need<br> is 11 extra flying minutes to make land.<br> Sullivan's the captain. He says we ditch.<br> Would you think I was wrong<br> if I tried to talk him out of it?<br> Maybe try a little luck?<br> Luck?<br> That's has-been thinking.<br> Wanna run out of fuel,<br> right over San Francisco?<br> Wipe out a few bridges<br> or apartment houses?<br> Sullivan's been over this ocean<br> lots of times. He knows his business.<br> I've seen men act like this before.<br> Sometimes because of one thing<br> or another,<br> fella stops thinking straight temporarily.<br> I've been flying a long time, Hobie.<br> Only, you're not the captain.<br> Maybe because your so-called luck<br> ran out on you once<br> down in South America.<br> This is no luck operation.<br> You better go back to<br> your helmet and goggles.<br> Maybe.<br> Here it is, Lennie.<br> Colour may not become you<br> - but it'll suffice you.<br> - Thanks, for nothing.<br> About that 11 minutes,<br> are you absolutely sure?<br> Absolutely.<br> Lennie says if we can pick up<br> He could be right.<br> It'll be rough down there.<br> If we hit wrong, we've had it.<br> Maybe we ought to ease off a little on<br> the power and save a few drops of fuel.<br> Any objections if I try it?<br> This won't work.<br> She's going to stall on me.<br> That's no good.<br> We'll blow another engine.<br> What's the difference?<br> We'll blow them all if we ditch.<br> Put those controls back<br> where they belong.<br> - Put those props back.<br> - Nothing doing, Skipper.<br> That's an order!<br> Hang on, chum. You can do it.<br> Now fly and let me pray.<br> We'll run out of gas,<br> right over San Francisco.<br> Let's try out this way for a while.<br> Don't be so anxious to go for a swim!<br> - She's starting to shake again.<br> - Let her shake!<br> Let her mush down a few feet if you<br> have to. We're saving fuel this way.<br> Hang on and fly!<br> Did you call Sullivan's wife?<br> Yes, sir. She's on her way to the airport.<br> - You didn't alarm her?<br> - No.<br> I just told her, her husband was on<br> his way, and that you wanted to see her.<br> Then she knows something's happened.<br> Probably. But her voice was quite calm.<br> How about the others?<br> Wheeler lives with another pilot,<br> Dupree. There was no answer.<br> The same for Wilby.<br> I called his home<br> and then a bar I know about.<br> His wife had been there,<br> but she left about an hour ago,<br> drunk.<br> - The stewardess?<br> - No, Spalding's mother isn't well.<br> Her father is out of town on business.<br> I wish I could tell them all together.<br> I think maybe they could<br> help each other.<br> There isn't anybody listed on there<br> for Dan Roman.<br> - Do you know any person close to him?<br> - Yeah.<br> But I don't think you could reach her.<br> Dan lives alone.<br> - Is everything all right?<br> - Just great, junior.<br> This is a stunning garment.<br> I feel like a catcher for the Dodgers.<br> It's a frowsy looking shroud,<br> if you ask me.<br> Baby.<br> I went through the first World War<br> and the Blitz in London.<br> I was scared, but not like this.<br> I want to show you something cute.<br> Want to see something cute?<br> I must be slipping.<br> No reaction, even from a man like you,<br> who should appreciate such things.<br> Keep talking. Please. Keep talking.<br> I'm frightened.<br> Talking. Honey, you don't know<br> what you're asking.<br> I'll tell you a good joke on me.<br> You know, I always dreaded<br> the idea of becoming an old woman,<br> and from the way things look now,<br> I won't have to worry about it anymore.<br> You know, I haven't been whistled at<br> in years.<br> And the idea of growing roses<br> for the rest of my life<br> was really beginning to haunt me.<br> There ought to be a home<br> for dames like me.<br> We should have organised.<br> You know, a house somewhere<br> with no mirror in it.<br> Far away, where we'd never have<br> to look at a young girl.<br> They have homes<br> for unmarried mothers.<br> But everybody forgets<br> about the girls who<br> never quite managed<br> to make things legal.<br> I think I could start one.<br> I can call it the "May Holst Home<br> for Broken-down Broads. "<br> I kind of like that, don't you?<br> Well, they're as ready now<br> as they'll ever be.<br> Can you take something else<br> in your stride?<br> I can try.<br> Good.<br> I want you to do me a favour.<br> Look, when I tell you, sit down there<br> with your back against that seat,<br> stay there,<br> no matter what else is going on.<br> Don't try to be a heroine<br> because in those last few moments,<br> there isn't anything in the world<br> you can do to help anybody.<br> You know, your face<br> can improve any landscape.<br> I want you to keep it that way.<br> So the favour for me is this pillow.<br> Hold it tightly over your face,<br> for yourself and for me.<br> With the wind and the sea<br> neither God nor Sullivan<br> can set this thing down tonight<br> like an egg crate.<br> We might just as well slam<br> into a mountain. Dan knows it. I know it.<br> And so does Sullivan.<br> Wilby, check your final position.<br> I'm going to take her down.<br> - Wait a few more minutes.<br> - Do as I say.<br> - But it looks like...<br> - Do as I say.<br> Give him a few more minutes.<br> I've already waited too long.<br> Here we go.<br> No, we don't. Get a hold of yourself,<br> you yellow...<br> Radar reports you're descending.<br> Are you going to ditch?<br> You are now below the minimum legal<br> altitude for approaching the coast.<br> Time's wasting.<br> You better climb or settle for the drink.<br> We're right with you. We'll follow you<br> down. Advise immediately.<br> We've been too busy to answer.<br> Stand by.<br> We may have a change in plans.<br> Thirty minutes of fuel left.<br> Cross-feed problem.<br> Throw the rule book away.<br> Highest obstruction, 1,950 feet,<br> so 2,200 will be safe.<br> Leonard, stand by electric altimeter,<br> call out readings.<br> Nose tipped down, ship fly faster.<br> More efficient use of fuel against time.<br> Study approach book.<br> Air Traffic Control to clear area.<br> Direction finders on range station.<br> Start right now.<br> Dan?<br> Yeah?<br> Thanks.<br> Thanks for knocking some sense<br> into my head.<br> - Someday I'll explain.<br> - You don't have to.<br> We're not going to ditch.<br> We'll make San Francisco the hard way.<br> Any change in the wind, Lennie?<br> We picked up three of those<br> Bring me the approach chart<br> for San Francisco.<br> Whistle me a tune, Dan.<br> I like music while I work.<br> - Can I get you something, Mr Briscoe?<br> - Yes. A ham sandwich.<br> I can't. Everything went overboard.<br> Now you put on that vest.<br> Great service.<br> You throw all the food to the sharks,<br> so you won't have to serve it.<br> Tell you what. Proposition.<br> I think Miss Chen will let me<br> buy her a steak in San Francisco,<br> if you come along, too.<br> If you'll accept, I'll put on the vest.<br> Mr Briscoe, you have yourself a deal.<br> - Take a breather, Dan.<br> - Okay.<br> The Farallon Islands, any minute now.<br> - Don't go any lower.<br> - No. I'll hold this altitude.<br> Get back and call out our altitude<br> on the radio altimeter.<br> We'll make straight for the<br> northwest leg of San Francisco range.<br> The area's been cleared<br> and we're practically on the ground.<br> I like the way you said that.<br> Twenty-eight miles to go.<br> He's made first base.<br> But if that guy runs out of fuel<br> between here and the airport,<br> I don't know where he'll put<br> that thing down<br> except in the middle of Market Street.<br> Shut that thing off.<br> Well?<br> I'm going over to the terminal.<br> If needed, I'll be in the control tower.<br> This is it. Ten minutes.<br> Come on, let's make a final check.<br> Inflate your vest, please.<br> - We're going down?<br> - Yeah, but you'll be all right.<br> Take your time coming back to the door.<br> Wait until I yell.<br> - Coast Guard plane still with us?<br> - Right off our wing. He'll stick with us.<br> Put out your cigarette, please.<br> Inflate your vest, Mr Childs.<br> You too, Miss Holst.<br> - Some brassiere.<br> - Don't smoke from now on. Good luck.<br> I really ought to take my briefcase.<br> Sorry, nothing doing.<br> Inflate your vest, please.<br> I can't.<br> I'm terrified.<br> I can't seem to move.<br> Don't worry. Good luck.<br> - All set, you two?<br> - We're still hungry.<br> Our steak date is postponed.<br> Inflate your vest, please.<br> Maybe you should keep this.<br> I'd loved thinking it was mine,<br> even if it was just for a few hours.<br> Nonsense.<br> You can keep it as dry as I can.<br> If it's still working tomorrow night<br> at 7:00,<br> take a cab to Ernie's restaurant<br> on Montgomery street.<br> If it isn't working, come anyway.<br> Thanks.<br> We got them all to blow up, see?<br> Good work. Remember take your time<br> coming back to the door.<br> You want?<br> No, thanks. Thanks just the same.<br> If anything happens to me,<br> get in touch with my wife in Honolulu.<br> - Tell her I loved her. I was mistaken.<br> - You tell her yourself, mister.<br> You'll be all right. I'm not worrying and<br> I'll be the last guy off this aeroplane.<br> - Do you have to be?<br> - That's what I get paid for.<br> - Seat belt tight?<br> - I think so.<br> This is for real, isn't it?<br> I'm afraid so. Inflate your vest, please.<br> Well, even I might float.<br> Inflate your vest, please.<br> I don't want to die.<br> Ed, don't let me die. My babies, Ed.<br> Give her two of these when you can.<br> They'll quiet her.<br> Stand by for anything. Sullivan is gonna<br> try and make San Francisco.<br> - Can we?<br> - I don't see how.<br> Technically, we're out of fuel right now.<br> We've bought it.<br> The coast hills must be coming up.<br> - Watch it!<br> -400, a little less.<br> Hang on!<br> Ground's coming up fast!<br> Twin Peaks coming up on your left<br> in a minute or so.<br> Remember those radio towers.<br> Stay on course.<br> Don't descend anymore.<br> Thanks. We're trying not to.<br> We must be past the hills.<br> Special weather.<br> Ceiling, 300 feet. Visibility, one mile.<br> Wind, west northwest.<br> Twenty to 25. Over.<br> Okay, San Francisco Tower.<br> We'll make an ILS approach.<br> Turn the runway lights up full blast.<br> - Cone of silence.<br> - Right with you, chum.<br> - We're cleared straight on down.<br> - This is going to be a fast one.<br> Stand by, check me with flaps and gear.<br> Get the outer marker, Dan.<br> Outer marker identified.<br> But we're way below our glide path,<br> so watch it, chum.<br> There's a 690-foot radio tower<br> around here someplace.<br> Has to be behind us,<br> we're right on the approach leg.<br> Let me know it when they're clear.<br> Feather it, Dan! Quick!<br> No time to fool with it.<br> Give me full power on the other two.<br> - You see anything?<br> - Not yet.<br> - Contact yet?<br> - No.<br> - This is a sweater.<br> - You're doing fine.<br> When we pass the inner marker,<br> I'm shoving her down regardless.<br> Yeah.<br> Approach lights dead ahead.<br> Maybe a mile.<br> Give her the gear.<br> Three green lights and pressure.<br> We can only stay in the air<br> another 30 seconds.<br> - Full flaps.<br> - Full flaps.<br> Now I lay me down to sleep.<br> Did you get hurt?<br> Was anyone hurt at all?<br> Two more coming down now.<br> There's Mr Pardee,<br> the famous producer.<br> He'll give us some information.<br> - You're Gustave Pardee, aren't you?<br> - I was. I'm not so sure now.<br> Please leave us alone. We're very tired.<br> Give us a few words about your flight.<br> I couldn't tell you.<br> Not in a million words.<br> - What will your next production be?<br> - It will take a little longer than usual.<br> - Next year, I hope.<br> - Next year?<br> Now, please let us pass.<br> Sally!<br> Who are you?<br> Miss, just one statement.<br> - Tell us who you are.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Why, it's a boy!<br> - Little boy.<br> He'll sure have a story<br> to tell his grandkids.<br> - Daddy wants you to come and see him.<br> - I will, darling. I will!<br> Look at my space material.<br> - Here he is. Who's that?<br> - Give us a statement.<br> Where's the nearest telephone?<br> I have to call Honolulu, my wife.<br> - Over there.<br> - Thanks.<br> No questions, please.<br> What happened?<br> Here she is.<br> Hold it right there. Thank you.<br> She must be in show business.<br> She's in show business, all right.<br> She's the star of the Follies!<br> Tell us your story.<br> Just one.<br> Papa!<br> Just a moment.<br> Listen, boys. I'm just a fisherman.<br> I want to see my kids.<br> Thirty gallons, Mr Garfield.<br> That's all there was left in all the tanks.<br> Too little to really measure.<br> Tell this man we must have<br> reservations on the plane,<br> first thing tomorrow morning.<br> We'll miss Elvira's party.<br> It's important to you.<br> What's Elvira's party<br> got to do with sled dogs?<br> Really, darling. Don't be tiresome.<br> We might as well play safe until you find<br> out how things are going to turn out.<br> All right, Lydia.<br> Hello, Pete.<br> Meet us out front.<br> We're going for our steaks.<br> Ten minutes, Mr Briscoe,<br> I'll be there for sure.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi, Mr Garfield.<br> - I think your wife's waiting for you.<br> - Yeah.<br> I don't want to keep her<br> standing too long. We're expecting.<br> When you get rested, call me.<br> We'll have a talk.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, Mr Garfield.<br> - Souvenir?<br> - For my wife.<br> I guess the rain won't hurt it,<br> better get it home though.<br> Susie will be waiting. Good night.<br> Well, I guess I better get going.<br> Little past my bedtime.<br> You had 30 gallons left.<br> Yeah.<br> Good night.
