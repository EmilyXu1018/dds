                        On Monday morning,<br> a patient named Guernsey...<br> male, middle 70s, was admitted<br> to the hospital complaining of chest pains.<br> He had been referred by a nursing home...<br> where the doctor had<br> diagnosed his condition as Angina pectoris.<br> It is axiomatic...<br> that nursing-home doctors<br> are always wrong.<br> The intern who admitted<br> Mr. Guernsey, however...<br> accepted the diagnosis<br> and prescribed morphine...<br> a drug suitable for angina,<br> but not at all suitable for emphysema...<br> which is unfortunately<br> what the old man actually had.<br> Within an hour, the patient<br> became unresponsive and diaphoretic...<br> and was raced up to Intensive Care,<br> with an irregular pulse of 150...<br> blood pressure 90 over 60,<br> respiration rapid and shallow.<br> The resident on duty in Intensive Care<br> compounded the blunder...<br> by treating the old man<br> for pulmonary edema.<br> He gave him digitalis, diuretics and oxygen.<br> This restored the old mars color.<br> He was sent to his room<br> in the Holly Pavilion...<br> ruddy-complected and peacefully asleep.<br> But the patient was in CO 2 narcosis,<br> and died at 7:30 that evening.<br> I mention all this only to explain<br> how the bed in Room 806 became available.<br> The intern involved<br> was a prickly young buck named Schaefer...<br> who had a good thing going for him<br> with a technician in the Hematology Lab.<br> In the haphazard fashion<br> of hospital romances...<br> Dr. Schaefer had been zapping this girl...<br> on wheelchairs, stretchers, pantry shelves...<br> in the kitchen, in the morgue,<br> in the dark corners of corridors...<br> standing up, sitting down...<br> So you can imagine<br> what an available bed meant to him.<br> Sheila, this is Howard.<br> I got a bed for us for tonight.<br> A real, honest-to-God bed.<br> Dr. Schaefer...<br> Did you know that Dr. Schaefer<br> was in Room 806 because he's dead?<br> What?<br> I'm just telling you that Dr. Schaefer is dead.<br> - What do you want, Perez?<br> - I don't know what this is about...<br> but Dr. Schaefer is in Room 806<br> with an IV running, and he's dead.<br> - I didn't even know he was sick.<br> - What the hell are you talking about?<br> - Do you know what she's talking about?<br> - No.<br> Maybe I'm going crazy. I don't know.<br> Isn't Room 806 the patient Guernsey?<br> Did something happen<br> that maybe I didn't know about?<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> This is the nuttiest thing I ever saw.<br> Dr. Schaefer is in Room 806, dead.<br> What Dr. Schaefer? Our Dr. Schaefer?<br> Our Dr. Schaefer. The one<br> who's always grabbing everybody's ass.<br> - Do you know what she's talking about?<br> - No.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> What do you mean,<br> "Dr. Schaefer's in Room 806, dead"?<br> I mean, he's lying on the far bed,<br> stone dead, and with an IV.<br> If you don't believe me,<br> you ought to go and look for yourself.<br> Maybe you'd better call Mrs. Christie.<br> Dr. Bock.<br> Yes, Mrs. Christie, what is it?<br> It's all right. I'd have to be getting up<br> any minute, anyway.<br> Sorry, I missed that.<br> Would you say it again, please?<br> I know.<br> Schaefer, the stud with the glasses,<br> fancies all the nurses.<br> I'm afraid I don't understand.<br> What do you mean?<br> Was he sick?<br> I mean...<br> What was the cause of death?<br> Was he being treated? I don't understand.<br> What was he doing in the bed?<br> You did say...<br> Mrs. Christie, did you call the office?<br> Good, I'II...<br> It's all right.<br> I'd be getting my wake-up call<br> any minute, anyway.<br> People!<br> What do you say, Sundstrom?<br> How long do you think your monopolistic,<br> exclusionary, racist policies will work?<br> Free the hope!<br> Now, hold it.<br> Herb! I'm glad I caught up with you.<br> How's it going?<br> One of my interns<br> dropped dead this morning.<br> Really? I'm sorry to hear that.<br> I understand you moved out to a hotel.<br> - Things got that bad with Phyllis?<br> - It's been that bad for 24 years.<br> You gonna be solicitous?<br> God.<br> I'm the guy<br> that brought you into this hospital...<br> so I think I can skip<br> the diplomatic overtures.<br> Marty stopped me<br> in the hall yesterday, very upset.<br> He had just had lunch with you.<br> He said you sounded suicidal.<br> Marty tends to be extravagant,<br> but he's not the only one.<br> Jack Singer mentioned<br> that you were boozing it up a lot.<br> Let's face it, you have been sloughing off.<br> I understand<br> you haven't even been doing rounds.<br> I'm going to do rounds today.<br> Do you want to take a couple of days off?<br> Go down to Montego Bay,<br> get drunk, get laid, get a little sun?<br> For God's sake, I'm 53 years old,<br> with all the attendant fears.<br> I just left my wife, after 24 years.<br> A standard case of menopausal melancholy.<br> - Maybe you wanna see Einorn.<br> - Don't wanna see a psychiatrist, don't worry.<br> If I just get to work, I'll be fine.<br> I'm sorry if I caused you concern.<br> Sid called from St. Luke's.<br> He said the demonstrators there...<br> - are planning a march to join those here.<br> - God.<br> - Did you call the cops?<br> - Sure.<br> - They're all in 806, Doctor.<br> - What happened?<br> I think I'll just let Mrs. Christie<br> tell you about it.<br> Oh, boy, what happened?<br> I've seen some pretty good snafus.<br> But this one...<br> There's a certain splendor to this one.<br> One of the night nurses<br> thought he was a patient...<br> and plugged an IV into him.<br> He was a diabetic.<br> What do you mean<br> she plugged an IV into him?<br> It's a really screwed-up story.<br> We had an old man in there<br> who died last night.<br> So the bed was available.<br> You know Schaefer. He's Sammy Stud.<br> He talked a nurse<br> into zapping him on the bed?<br> A girl from Hematology<br> he's been running around with.<br> - God, it's a Roman farce!<br> - I thought I heard you out here.<br> I suggest you do that right now.<br> I'm so terribly sorry.<br> As I understand it...<br> a nurse inadvertently administered an IV<br> to Schaefer. How could that happen?<br> - We ought to straighten this out elsewhere.<br> - Very good idea.<br> Oh, God, what a mess!<br> - These things happen.<br> - I'd better call the Medical Examiner.<br> - I still don't understand what happened.<br> - It took us an hour to get it sorted out.<br> A patient named Guernsey<br> died last night, in 806.<br> That information wasn't given<br> to the night nurses. These things happen.<br> At any rate, according to the cardex...<br> the patient, Guernsey, was down<br> for 25 mg of Sparine at q. 6h.<br> Mrs. Reardon sent Nurse Perez<br> to give him his 12:00 shot.<br> In the meantime, Dr. Schaefer<br> usurped that particular bed...<br> for his own purposes.<br> Dr. Brubaker suggests<br> it was for a love tryst...<br> and some weight is given that hypothesis...<br> - by the fact that Dr. Schaefer was naked.<br> - I get the drift.<br> Nurse Perez went in<br> and sedated Dr. Schaefer...<br> thinking it was the patient Guernsey.<br> What I don't understand...<br> May I finish, please?<br> After Perez gave him his shot, she noticed<br> the IV was pinched off on the bed.<br> She reported this to Mrs. Reardon...<br> who then assigned Nurse Rivers<br> to restart the IV.<br> Rivers was a float. She didn't even know<br> the staff people on the floor.<br> Nobody knew what the patient looked like,<br> since he'd only been admitted that morning.<br> - So she plugged an IV into him.<br> - Yes.<br> - How much?<br> - A liter.<br> Five percent glucose solution<br> won't kill anybody.<br> Was he dehydrated?<br> Did he have any ancillary conditions?<br> Didrt anybody bother to go check on him<br> during the night?<br> Even under the impression<br> that he was merely a patient?<br> Was he hyperosmolar?<br> Did he have a bad heart?<br> He must have had some sort of thrombosis.<br> I want the post done here, Mr. Hitchcock.<br> You and I better have a chat<br> about your excessive use of float nurses.<br> I've got nearly a thousand nurses<br> in this hospital...<br> Every time one of them has her period,<br> she disappears for three days.<br> Doctors complain they can't find<br> the same nurse on the same floor...<br> two days in a row.<br> What am I gonna tell Schaefer's parents?<br> That a substitute nurse assassinated him...<br> as she couldn't tell the doctors<br> from the patients on the floor?<br> My God!<br> The incompetence here<br> is absolutely radiant!<br> Two nurses walk into a room<br> and stick needles in a man...<br> and one of those is a Number 18 Jelco,<br> tourniquet the poor guy...<br> anchor the poor guy's arm<br> with adhesive tape...<br> and it's the wrong poor son of a bitch!<br> Where do you train your nurses,<br> Mrs. Christie? Dachau?<br> All right.<br> Wrap him up<br> and get him down to Pathology.<br> I'm especially interested in his blood sugar.<br> A liter of glucose never killed anybody.<br> Your ladies must have done something else.<br> - Will there be anything else?<br> - No.<br> Before you call the family,<br> I wish you'd speak to Mr. Mead about this.<br> We'd like, naturally, to avoid litigation.<br> A few things have been piling up.<br> Would you like to go into them?<br> A quickie.<br> Dr. Esterhazy wants to start hiring<br> temporary people...<br> to cover the summer vacations.<br> He says, last year,<br> some of the replacement people...<br> didn't receive their checks<br> until they waited six months.<br> He wonders if you could do something<br> about getting these people paid promptly.<br> Ms. Aronivici complains the lab reports<br> are coming in slow into the ER.<br> I called Dr. Immelman about that,<br> and she says three microscopes...<br> have been stolen out of her lab<br> in the last two months.<br> Charlie Walters<br> also complains about pilferage.<br> I've clumped all these together for you.<br> As you know...<br> we've agreed to take over<br> the local ambulance cases...<br> as part of the hospital's commitment<br> to the community...<br> and it's created a serious overload in ER.<br> I don't know why this was dumped<br> in our lap, but they seem to think...<br> Find out if Dr. Einorn is in his office.<br> Which Dr. Einorn?<br> - Ophthalmology or Psychiatry?<br> - Psychiatry. Never mind. I'll look in, myself.<br> Is he in?<br> - Can I have a minute, Joe?<br> - Of course.<br> I've been having periods<br> of acute depression, recently.<br> Apparently, it's becoming noticeable.<br> A number of people have remarked about it.<br> John Sundstrom thought it might<br> be a good idea if I spoke to you about it.<br> - Do you want to sit down?<br> - No. I'm not good at confessional.<br> What can I tell you?<br> The last year, two, three...<br> It goes way back, I suppose.<br> I remember entertaining suicidal thoughts<br> as a college student.<br> At any rate...<br> I've always found life demanding.<br> I'm an only child<br> of a lower-middle-class people.<br> I was the glory of my parents.<br> "My son, the doctor." You know.<br> I was always top of my class.<br> Scholarship to Harvard. The boy genius.<br> The brilliant eccentric.<br> Terrified of women, clumsy at sports.<br> God, how do I go about this?<br> I understand<br> you just separated from your wife.<br> I left her a dozen times.<br> She left me a dozen times.<br> We stayed through a process of attrition.<br> Obviously, sadomasochistic dependency.<br> My home is hell.<br> We've got a 23-year-old boy.<br> I threw him out of the house last year.<br> A shaggy-haired Maoist.<br> I don't know where he is.<br> Presumably, building bombs in basements<br> as an expression of universal brotherhood.<br> I've got a 17-year-old daughter<br> who's had two abortions in two years...<br> got arrested last week at a rock festival,<br> for pushing drugs.<br> They let her go.<br> The typical affluent American family.<br> I don't mean to be facile about this.<br> I blame myself<br> for those two useless young people.<br> I never exercised parental authority.<br> I'm no good at that.<br> Oh, God, I'm no good at this, either.<br> Let's just forget the whole thing.<br> I'm sorry I bothered you.<br> How serious are your suicidal speculations?<br> I amuse myself with different ways<br> of killing myself that don't look like suicide.<br> I wouldn't want to do my family<br> out of the insurance.<br> Digitalis will give you an arrhythmia.<br> A good toxologist would find traces.<br> Potassium's much better.<br> Then you're stuck<br> with how to get rid of the hypodermic.<br> Forty milli-equivalent.<br> Gives you time to dispose of the evidence.<br> You seem to have given<br> considerable thought to the matter.<br> You ought to know that a man<br> who talks about it all the time never does it.<br> I don't know. I see a man exhausted...<br> emotionally drained, riddled with guilt...<br> has been systematically stripping himself<br> of wife, children, friends...<br> isolating himself from the world.<br> - Are you impotent?<br> - Intermittently.<br> - What does that mean?<br> - I haven't tried in so long, I don't know.<br> Let's just drop the whole thing, Joe.<br> I feel humiliated and stupid.<br> I just got to pull myself together<br> and get back into my work.<br> I'm sorry I troubled you.<br> Take care of yourself. I'll see you later.<br> Ten-four, save our homes.<br> Two, four, we the poor.<br> Don't go 'round. Don't tear us down.<br> - All set?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Who was that exotic group?<br> - You got me.<br> - They've been here about an hour.<br> - I think they're with the old man in 806.<br> Dr. Perry said he picked the tuberculosis<br> and liver nodes for today.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Good, because that's the one I studied up.<br> - A hell of a case.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Who's presenting?<br> - I am, sir. Should I start?<br> Mr. Hemmings!<br> Is there anybody seated<br> who hasn't been to see me first?<br> Is there anybody here who has not<br> given me their health-insurance number?<br> Emergency Room.<br> I don't know, Sybil. What's his name?<br> Wait a moment, please. I'm on the phone.<br> Can't you see I'm on the phone?<br> I am, Sybil. I'm looking.<br> Of course not. Do they ever?<br> Would you mind, please? Excuse me.<br> Thirty-two?<br> Telescope sights.<br> They follow me everywhere.<br> Three big Black men. Naked,<br> completely exposed, right in the street.<br> Hanging down to their knees.<br> It's disgusting.<br> Did you call upstairs and tell them<br> to admit a patient named Mitgang?<br> - Is that the concussion?<br> - I don't know.<br> They said you didn't fill out the chart.<br> Where do you come off sending anyone<br> up to Admitting without my okay?<br> Would you get the hell out of here?<br> The patient's in the holding room.<br> You want his Blue Cross number, go get it.<br> Dr. Spezio, may I see you for a moment,<br> if you don't mind?<br> Is this your handwriting, if you don't mind?<br> Am I supposed to read this?<br> Was that a sprain, a broken wrist?<br> I can't read that scribbling.<br> I have to bill these people.<br> I know you are the ministering angels...<br> and I'm the bitch from the<br> accounting department, but I've a job, too.<br> If you don't mind, Doctor.<br> The kid had a colly fracture,<br> we had him in the OR.<br> We reduced it,<br> and we gave him a small cast.<br> But did you give him a sling?<br> You must've taken x-rays.<br> How am I supposed<br> to make out the charges?<br> - Are you Mitgang?<br> - I'm Mitgang.<br> Do you carry Blue Cross Blue Shield,<br> if you don't mind?<br> Do you have your card with you?<br> Do you know your number?<br> You are not leaving this room<br> until I have this information.<br> Do you mind if I at least<br> ask this gentleman to fill out his chart?<br> May I have your AHS policy number, sir?<br> Do you carry Blue Cross Blue Shield?<br> Dr. Spezio!<br> I think one of your patients in here is dead.<br> Why do you say that, Mrs. Cushing?<br> Because he wouldn't give me<br> his Blue Cross number.<br> Christ!<br> How long has this man been lying here?<br> Isn't he the doctor that came in<br> around 9:00?<br> "Pete's sake," I said, "This is a hospital.<br> One of our feed lines just blew."<br> We were lucky to trace it in time.<br> Have we covered everything?<br> Dr. Kish has been driving me nuts<br> about the OR schedule.<br> He's supposed to see me about that.<br> This is the Emergency Room.<br> One of the doctors died of a heart attack.<br> - One of our staff?<br> - I think so.<br> Tom, you want to go down<br> to the Emergency Room?<br> - One of our doctors just died.<br> - Another one?<br> See what that's about.<br> I'll be on Holly 8, and I'll be right back.<br> It's no longer pilferage.<br> It's reached the point of piracy.<br> - That's the third microscope this month.<br> - Let's get together on this later today.<br> - How about 1:00?<br> - 1:00 will be fine.<br> Your brother's in his room.<br> - What one is it?<br> - 806.<br> You're gonna be in the hospital<br> for two lousy days.<br> - What's the fuss about?<br> - You're supposed to be a big wheel here.<br> The private rooms are full.<br> If they brought in Jesus Christ<br> fresh off the cross, I couldn't get him one.<br> - I'm not staying in a room with a dying man.<br> - He's not dying.<br> They'll screen him off.<br> You won't even know he's here.<br> If you want a private room, go home.<br> I'll call you when one comes up.<br> But you phoned me, in a panic.<br> You're going on vacation.<br> They'll cut this polyp out tomorrow.<br> You'll be home Thursday, in Miami Friday.<br> - Will you talk some sense into this lunatic?<br> - You said it. He's a lunatic.<br> Big wheel! Can't even get me a private room.<br> I'll get you a tranquilizer.<br> "Five. A full...<br> "abdomen..."<br> contrasted with wasting elsewhere.<br> "Six. Ascites..."<br> with a protein content above 4 grams.<br> Unexplained anemia, leukopenia.<br> Unexplained elevation<br> of the serum gamma globulin level.<br> Especially abnormal flocculation tests,<br> and of course, a positive PPD.<br> All of these findings<br> assume special significance in Negroes.<br> This has been a very commendable workup.<br> It's as commendable a workup of an FUO<br> as I can remember.<br> The staff on this floor is to be applauded.<br> All right, let's go take a look at the girl.<br> It's a reportable case, Brubaker.<br> I'd write it up.<br> Nurse...<br> who's the senior resident on this floor?<br> That would be Dr. Brubaker.<br> But he's at Chief-of-Service rounds, now.<br> That's this way?<br> I wonder if there's some correlation between<br> hepatic tuberculosis and drug addiction.<br> Presumably, there was an early<br> consideration of SBE?<br> Yes, sir. We discounted it<br> after repeated blood cultures were negative.<br> - You, Ambler. Is that right, "Ambler"?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What else do you look for<br> in Bacterial Endocarditis?<br> Dr. Brubaker, can I see you<br> for a minute, please?<br> Still a little icteric.<br> Who's got an ophthalmoscope?<br> Did anyone note Roth spots?<br> Don't worry about it. There aren't any.<br> Ambler, you're our big man on SBE.<br> - What was the latex fixation?<br> - It wasn't done, sir.<br> Don't you think that's an important test<br> to differentiate SBE from miliary TB?<br> Not you, Biegelman. Ambler.<br> There's about a 70 percent incidence<br> of false-positive latex in SBE.<br> You have been reading up.<br> If the diagnosis were SBE...<br> would a positive latex<br> indicate anything in the therapy?<br> - We'd expect the latex to become negative.<br> - Lf...<br> If the antibiotic therapy were successful.<br> - Are you applying for your internship here?<br> - I'm not sure.<br> Come and see me.<br> Would you sit up, please, miss?<br> We've got a little thing here, Doctor.<br> The girl over there<br> is the daughter of the patient in 806.<br> He is at the moment comatose,<br> and requires intravenous feeding and meds.<br> The daughter wants to take the father<br> out of the hospital...<br> and back to Mexico, where they live.<br> The patient's name is Drummond.<br> He's apparently a Methodist missionary.<br> They run some kind of religious mission<br> among the Apache Indians.<br> The daughter says she's a licensed nurse...<br> so she can give<br> the necessary IVs and treatment.<br> I don't think he should be let out<br> of the hospital.<br> The attending,<br> the guy in brown over there, concurs.<br> Wait, let me have all that again.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> this is Dr. Biegelmars case.<br> Never mind the professional ethics.<br> What happened?<br> I don't know why I'm covering up<br> for that son of a bitch in Farkis Pavilion.<br> The patient, a man of 56,<br> was admitted to the hospital 10 days ago...<br> in good health, for a checkup.<br> No visible distress.<br> We did the mandatory workup on him.<br> Blood cultures, stool, LE preps, chest EKG.<br> All negative. However, there was<br> some evidence of protein in his urine.<br> I don't know how that guy<br> in Farkis Pavilion found out.<br> Maybe he had a deal<br> with one of the girls in the lab.<br> He turned up the next day...<br> conned the patient into signing<br> an authorization for a biopsy.<br> - What guy in Farkis Pavilion?<br> - Some postgrad fellow named Ives.<br> Elroy Ives. I never met him. He's on<br> one of the immunology research programs.<br> Some postgrad came up here,<br> did a biopsy on the patient?<br> Yes, sir. He conned Biegelman<br> with that story...<br> Protein in the urine?<br> - And he biopsied the man?<br> - And he nicked a vessel.<br> They woke up Biegelman at 2:00<br> in the morning, as the patient was in shock.<br> Biegelman called the kidney people<br> for a consult.<br> But what was there to see?<br> The patient was sour and bleeding.<br> Spoke to this fellow, Sutcliff.<br> He referred us to a surgeon named Welbeck.<br> - That barber?<br> - You ain't heard nothing yet.<br> We finally got Welbeck<br> around 4:00 in the morning.<br> He said go ahead.<br> So they laid the surgery for 8:00.<br> Welbeck turned up half-stoned,<br> orders an IVP, clears him for allergies...<br> Without actually testing,<br> and the patient went into shock.<br> And tubular necrosis.<br> They lopped out the bleeding kidney...<br> ran him back to the room,<br> we waited for urine.<br> Fever began spiking like hell, uremia,<br> vomiting. So we arranged hemodialysis.<br> He's putting out good water now...<br> but some nurse goofed on his last<br> treatment. A shunt separated, something.<br> Blood pressure plunged.<br> They ran him up to ICU...<br> gave him two units of whole blood.<br> Vital signs are normal, but he's comatose.<br> - That was two days ago.<br> - In short...<br> a man comes into this hospital<br> in perfect health...<br> and in the space of one week,<br> we chop out one kidney...<br> damage another, reduce him to coma,<br> and damn near kill him.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You know, Brubaker...<br> last night I sat in my hotel room,<br> reviewing the shambles of my life...<br> and contemplating suicide.<br> I said, "No, Bock, don't do it.<br> You're a doctor, you're a healer.<br> "You're the Chief of Medicine<br> at one of the great hospitals of the world.<br> "You are a necessary person.<br> Your life is meaningful."<br> Then I walk in here, today,<br> and I find out that one of my doctors...<br> was killed by a couple of nurses<br> who mistook him for a patient...<br> because he screwed a technician<br> from the Nephrology Lab.<br> - Hematology...<br> - Now you come to me...<br> with this gothic horror story in which<br> the entire machinery of modern medicine...<br> has apparently conspired<br> to destroy one lousy patient.<br> How am I to sustain my feeling<br> of meaningfulness in the face of this?<br> I'll tell you something.<br> If there were an oven around here,<br> I'd stick my head in it.<br> What was the name<br> of that guy from Farkis Pavilion, again?<br> Ives, sir. Elroy Ives.<br> - Somebody ought to ream his ass.<br> - I'm going to ream his ass.<br> I'm gonna break that Welbeck's back.<br> I'll defrock those two cannibals.<br> They will never again practice<br> in this hospital. I'll tell you that.<br> What about the girl? She says<br> we have no right to stop her...<br> from taking her father out.<br> She's willing to sign an AOR form.<br> Let him go...<br> before we kill him.<br> Get me Dr. Gilley.<br> I want to talk to him right now.<br> Put him on page, if you have to.<br> I don't care if he's operating.<br> You get me some monkey named Ives.<br> L-V-E-S. First name, Elroy.<br> He's in the Farkis Pavilion.<br> I want to talk to you, Joe.<br> Come in my office, please.<br> You got some punk rotating<br> in your department, named Ives?<br> Also, I want to ask you<br> what kind of dialysis room you're running.<br> Excuse me.<br> Gilley? Bock.<br> Didrt you tell me a few months ago...<br> you were gonna cut off all privileges<br> for that assassin, Welbeck?<br> Welbeck, yes! He just butchered<br> another one of my patients!<br> The mars a buccaneer.<br> I want him brought up<br> before the Medical Executive Committee.<br> He's in your department, not mine.<br> He's putatively a surgeon!<br> I'll be here.<br> I think you should know<br> you've got some research guy named Ives...<br> in your department<br> who's doing some dubious biopsies.<br> We're having enough problems<br> squeezing grants...<br> - out of the Nixon Administration...<br> - Ives is dead. That's why I'm here.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I mean he's dead.<br> He had a heart attack<br> in the Emergency Room.<br> He had a heart attack<br> in the Emergency Room?<br> What is this? Some kind of plague?<br> Where is he now?<br> They were just taking him<br> down to Pathology.<br> ...the next thing anybody knew,<br> three hours later...<br> Mrs. Cushing said there was a dead man<br> in the holding room.<br> You don't find anything<br> a little grotesque about all this?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I mean, at 8:30 this morning...<br> we meet over a doctor<br> who's killed intravenously...<br> and here we are four hours later,<br> with another doctor...<br> who's died of a heart attack<br> in the Emergency Room.<br> What are you suggesting?<br> You think we have a mad killer<br> stalking the hospital halls?<br> Presumably, Dr. Ives died of a heart attack,<br> and Schaefer in a diabetic coma.<br> People do die of these things.<br> It's all coincidental,<br> but I wouldn't call it grotesque.<br> How long are they gonna be<br> on Schaefer's post?<br> - I don't think you'd like to call next-of-kin?<br> - No, thanks.<br> God, I need a drink.<br> Mr. Mead?<br> I have an injection for you.<br> What the hell is going on in there?<br> Honey, we got a witch doctor in 806...<br> and you better go in there.<br> You know that Indian that was sitting<br> in 806 all night? He's still there.<br> And the girl's there,<br> and they're doing some voodoo in there.<br> - And I ain't kidding!<br> - What're you talking about?<br> I mean that Indiars in there,<br> half-naked, going...<br> ...with a little bag.<br> You just better get in there, Mrs. Dunne.<br> You wanna see something, baby?<br> You just come here.<br> It's a perfectly harmless ceremony.<br> It's nothing to get excited about.<br> It'll be over in a few minutes, anyway.<br> Mr. Blacktree is a shaman<br> who gets his power from the thunder...<br> and it's imperative he conclude his ritual<br> while the storm is still going on.<br> Visiting hours were over at 9:00.<br> All that's going on in there<br> is a simple Apache prayer...<br> for my father's recovery.<br> The markings he's made<br> on my father's arms...<br> are from the pollen of the tule plant.<br> The twigs have no significance,<br> except they've been struck by lightning...<br> and are consequently appeals<br> to the spirit of lightning.<br> It's all entirely harmless.<br> A religious ceremony, not a medical one.<br> You don't seriously believe<br> all that mumbo jumbo's gonna cure him?<br> On the other hand, it won't kill him.<br> - Okay. Go ahead.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You still gonna take your father out?<br> - I have to arrange an ambulance.<br> - Is there a phone here I could use?<br> - Use my office.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello. I'd like to arrange an ambulance.<br> I'd like to arrange an ambulance<br> at 1:30, tomorrow afternoon.<br> Drummond. First name, Barbara.<br> I'll pay cash.<br> You're to pick up my father,<br> Drummond, Edward...<br> at the Manattan Medical Center,<br> Holly Pavilion, Room 806.<br> It's a stretcher case.<br> I presume you provide the stretcher.<br> He's to be taken to American Airlines...<br> Kennedy Airport,<br> Flight 729 to Yuma, Arizona.<br> I'll accompany the patient. Thank you.<br> - You believe in witchcraft, Miss Drummond?<br> - I believe in everything.<br> - You like a drink?<br> - Yeah.<br> My father, you should know,<br> was a very successful doctor in Boston.<br> A member of the Harvard Medical Faculty.<br> He was a widower, and I was his only child.<br> He was not an especially religious man,<br> a sober Methodist.<br> One evening, seven years ago...<br> he attended a Pentecostal meeting<br> at Harvard...<br> and found himself speaking in tongues.<br> He sank to his knees at the back of the room<br> and began to talk fluently...<br> in a language which no one<br> had ever heard before.<br> This sort of thing happens frequently<br> at Pentecostal meetings...<br> and began happening regularly to my father.<br> It was not unusual to walk into our home<br> and find my father sitting in his office...<br> utterly serene, happily speaking to the air<br> in this strange, foreign tongue.<br> I was, at that time, 20 years old...<br> having my obligatory affair<br> with a minority group.<br> In my case, a Hopi Indian,<br> a postgraduate fellow at Harvard...<br> doing his doctorate in aboriginal languages<br> of the Southwest.<br> One day, I brought the Indian boy home...<br> just as my father was sinking to his knees<br> in the entrance foyer in one of his trances.<br> The Indian wheeled in his tracks,<br> and he said, "I'll be a son of a bitch!"<br> You see, my father<br> was speaking an Apache dialect...<br> an obscure dialect, at that...<br> spoken only by a ragged band<br> of unreconstructed Indians...<br> who had rejected the reservation,<br> and gone to live in isolation...<br> in the Sierra Madre Mountains<br> in Northern Mexico.<br> What do you say to that?<br> What the hell am I supposed to say to that?<br> I'm sitting here boozing,<br> and you come in and tell me...<br> some demented story<br> about your father's religious conversion.<br> You miss the point.<br> Not my father's conversion, mine.<br> You see, I'd been hitting the acid<br> pretty regularly at that time.<br> I had achieved a few minor sensory<br> deformities, some suicidal despairs...<br> but nothing as wild<br> as fluency in an obscure Apache dialect.<br> I mean, like, "Wow, man!"<br> Here was living afflatus<br> right before my eyes!<br> Within a week, my father had closed<br> his Beacon Hill practice...<br> and set out to start a mission<br> in the Mexican Mountains.<br> I turned in my SDS card<br> and my crash helmet, and I followed him.<br> It was a disaster, at least for me.<br> My father had received the revelation, not I.<br> He stood gaunt on a mountain slope<br> and preached the Apocalypse...<br> to solemnly amused Indians.<br> I masturbated a lot.<br> We lived in a grass wickiup...<br> ate raw rabbit and crushed pion nuts.<br> It was hideous.<br> Within two months, I was back in Boston.<br> A hollow shell, disenchanted<br> with everything, and dizzy with dengue.<br> I turned to austerity, combed my hair<br> tight, entered nursing school.<br> I became haggard, driven...<br> had shamelessly incestuous dreams<br> about my father.<br> I took up with some of the senior staff there.<br> One of them...<br> a portly psychiatrist, explained...<br> I was generated<br> by an unresolved lust for my father.<br> I cracked up.<br> One day, they found me walking to work<br> naked and screaming obscenities.<br> There was talk of institutionalizing me.<br> So I packed a bag and went back to join<br> my father in the Sierra Madre Mountains.<br> I've been there ever since.<br> That's three years.<br> My father is, of course, as mad as a hatter.<br> I watch over him,<br> and have been curiously content.<br> You see, I believe in everything.<br> What was that all about?<br> I thought I was obvious as hell.<br> I'm trying to tell you,<br> I have a thing about middle-aged men.<br> I admire your candor.<br> You've been admiring a lot more than that.<br> You're wasting your time.<br> I've been impotent for years.<br> Rubbish.<br> What the hell is wrong with being impotent?<br> Kids are more hung up on sex<br> than the Victorians.<br> I got a son, 23 years old.<br> I threw him out of the house last year.<br> Pietistic little humbug.<br> He preached universal love,<br> and he despised everyone.<br> Had a blanket contempt for the middle class,<br> even its decencies.<br> Detested my mother<br> because she had a petit bourgeois pride...<br> in her son, the doctor.<br> I cannot tell you how brutishly<br> he ignored that rather good lady.<br> When she died,<br> he didn't even come to the funeral.<br> He felt the chapel service was an hypocrisy.<br> He told me his generation<br> didn't live with lies.<br> I said, "Listen, everybody lives with lies."<br> I grabbed him by his poncho...<br> and I dragged him the length...<br> of our seven-room, despicably affluent...<br> middle-class apartment,<br> and I flung him... out.<br> I haven't seen him since.<br> You know what he said to me?<br> He's standing there on the landing,<br> on the verge of tears.<br> He shrieked at me:<br> "You old fink.<br> "You can't even get it up anymore."<br> That was it, you see.<br> That was his real revolution.<br> It wasn't racism...<br> the oppressed poor, or the war in Vietnam.<br> The ultimate American societal sickness...<br> was a limp dingus.<br> My God.<br> If there is a despised,<br> misunderstood minority in this country...<br> it is us poor, impotent bastards.<br> I'm impotent, and I'm proud of it.<br> Impotence is beautiful, baby!<br> - Power to the impotent! Right on, baby!<br> - Right on!<br> You know...<br> when I say impotent,<br> I don't mean merely limp.<br> Disagreeable as it may be for a woman,<br> a man may lust for other things...<br> something a little less transient<br> than an erection.<br> A sense of permanent won'th.<br> That's what medicine was to me,<br> my reason for being.<br> When I was 34...<br> I presented a paper<br> before the annual convention...<br> of the Society of Clinical Investigation...<br> that pioneered<br> the whole goddamn field of Immunology.<br> A breakthrough.<br> I'm in all the textbooks.<br> I happen to be an eminent man.<br> You know something else?<br> I don't give a goddamn.<br> When I say impotent...<br> I mean I've lost even my desire to work.<br> That's a hell of a lot<br> more primal passion than sex.<br> I've lost my reason for being.<br> My purpose.<br> The only thing I ever truly loved.<br> It is all rubbish, isn't it?<br> Transplants, antibodies...<br> We manufacture genes.<br> We can produce birth ectogenetically.<br> We can practically clone people<br> like carrots...<br> and half the kids in this ghetto<br> haven't even been inoculated for polio!<br> We have established the most enormous...<br> medical entity ever conceived...<br> and people are sicker than ever!<br> We cure nothing!<br> We heal nothing!<br> The whole goddamn wretched world...<br> is strangulating in front of our eyes.<br> That's what I mean when I say impotent.<br> You don't know<br> what the hell I'm talking about, do you?<br> Of course I do.<br> I'm very tired.<br> And I hurt.<br> I've got nothing going for me anymore.<br> Can you understand that?<br> Of course.<br> Can you also understand...<br> that the only admissible matter left is death?<br> Sounds to me like a familiar case<br> of morbid menopause.<br> Christ.<br> It's hard for me<br> to take your despair seriously.<br> - You obviously enjoy it so much.<br> - Bugger off!<br> That's all I need now, is clinical insight.<br> Some cockamamie 25-year-old acidhead...<br> is gonna reassure me<br> about the menopause now!<br> I'd like to be alone.<br> Why don't you just beat it?<br> Close the door and turn off the lights<br> on your way out.<br> Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my miniskirt...<br> but it was the only thing I had<br> to come to the city with.<br> Back at the tribe,<br> I wear ankle-length buckskin.<br> Swell. Close the door and turn off the lights.<br> What're you shooting?<br> Leave me alone.<br> Potassium.<br> You take enough of this stuff, it'll kill you.<br> I thought I might have read you wrong, that<br> you really were suicidal, so I came back.<br> Who asked you?<br> Leave me alone!<br> Why can't you leave me alone?<br> Leave me alone.<br> Why didn't you let me do it?<br> I'll see you.<br> Do you have a match, Doctor?<br> You wouldn't be awake?<br> - What time is it?<br> - Almost 7:00.<br> I swiped this for you<br> out of the nurses' locker room.<br> I'll make good on your dress.<br> I'm afraid it was torn beyond repair.<br> I'll buy you a new one, or give me the size<br> and I'll send it on to you.<br> I wanna talk to you about that.<br> - Talk to me about what?<br> - Your father.<br> You really shouldn't take him out of here<br> in his condition.<br> I've just been looking at his chart.<br> There's no reason to presume brain damage.<br> You can't predict anything<br> in these instances...<br> but he could come out of that coma<br> at any time.<br> I think you should leave him here.<br> I'll personally look after him.<br> Is this your way of saying you'd like me<br> to stay in town a few more days?<br> That would be nice, too.<br> What do you say, Miss Drummond?<br> I expect you can call me Barbara...<br> considering you ravished me<br> three times last night.<br> - Three times?<br> - Look at him pretending he didn't count.<br> You were as puffed up as a toad about it.<br> Punched a couple of holes in your crusade<br> for universal impotence, didn't it?<br> I think we're on first-name basis now.<br> I'll call you Herb.<br> Let's give your father a week, Barbara.<br> What do you say?<br> I don't want my father in this hospital.<br> I had a dream about this hospital.<br> I dreamt this enormous...<br> starched, white-tile building<br> suddenly erupted like a volcano...<br> and all the patients, doctors, nurses,<br> attendants, orderlies...<br> the whole line-staff, food-service people,<br> the aged, the lame...<br> and you, right in the middle...<br> were stampeding in one hideous,<br> screaming, suicidal mass into the sea.<br> I'm taking my father out of here,<br> and as quickly as I can.<br> You're really a fruitcake, you know?<br> Let me put it this way. I love you.<br> I fancied you from the moment you came<br> lumbering down that hallway, upstairs.<br> I said to Mr. Blacktree,<br> "Who's that hulking bear of a man?"<br> The Apaches are reverential about bears.<br> Won't eat bear meat, never skin bears.<br> Bears are thought of as both benign<br> and evil, but very strong power.<br> Men with bear power are highly respected<br> and are said to be great healers.<br> "That man," I said,<br> "gets his power from the bear."<br> Swell. Now, look.<br> You haven't got a hotel room<br> or some sort of accommodations...<br> - where you can stay...<br> - Let me put it this way.<br> My father and I accept<br> the implacability of death.<br> If he dies, he dies.<br> I'm getting him out of here<br> and back to Mexico at 1:00 p.m.<br> I want you to come with us,<br> because I love you and want children.<br> I'm afraid Mexico<br> is a little too remote for me.<br> We could use you down there.<br> There's a curiously high incidence of TB.<br> You'd be a doctor again.<br> You'd be necessary again.<br> If you love me, I don't see any other choice.<br> What do you mean, if I love you?<br> I raped you in a suicidal rage.<br> How did we get to love and children?<br> I ought to know if a man loves me or not.<br> You must've told me half a hundred times<br> last night you loved me.<br> You murmured and shouted it.<br> You even opened the window<br> and bellowed it out into the street.<br> Those were more expressions<br> of gratitude than love.<br> Gratitude for what?<br> For resurrecting feelings of life in me<br> I thought dead.<br> My God, what do you think love is?<br> All right, I love you! You love me!<br> I'm not about to argue<br> with so relentless a romantic.<br> Since we have this great passion<br> going for us...<br> why don't you stay around New York<br> for a week or 10 days?<br> It's up to 10 days now.<br> - Just until your father's condition improves.<br> - No.<br> I've had these prophetic dreams<br> for seven nights.<br> Seven is a sinister number.<br> The meaning of these dreams is very clear,<br> seven times as clear.<br> I'm to get you and my father out of here<br> before we're all destroyed.<br> You're certifiable.<br> Half the time<br> you're an intelligent young woman...<br> then all of a sudden,<br> you turn into a Cabalist...<br> who believes in dreams<br> and witchcraft and bear power.<br> I don't like the way<br> you dismiss my whole life as unnecessary.<br> I do a lot of healing here in Manattan.<br> I don't have to go to Mexico to do it.<br> I also teach.<br> I send out 80 doctors a year into the world...<br> often inspirited, at least competent.<br> I've built up one of the best departments<br> of medicine in the world.<br> We have a hell of a heart unit,<br> we have a hell of a kidney group.<br> A lot of people come into this place<br> in big trouble...<br> and go out a lot better for the experience,<br> so don't tell me how unnecessary I am.<br> So why were you trying to kill yourself<br> with an overdose of potassium?<br> - Where are you going?<br> - My hotel. I have to check out.<br> Mr. Blacktree doesn't speak any English.<br> - You're coming back, of course?<br> - Of course.<br> I have to settle the bill, pack my father.<br> I think you need a few hours alone<br> to make your decisions.<br> What decision?<br> You're a very tired, very damaged man.<br> You've had a hideous marriage,<br> I assume a few tacky affairs along the way.<br> You're understandably reluctant<br> to get involved again.<br> And here I am with this preposterous idea...<br> you throw everything up and go off with me<br> to some barren mountains in Mexico.<br> Utterly mad, I know. On the other hand...<br> you find this world as desolate as I do.<br> You did try to kill yourself last night.<br> So that's it.<br> Either me and the mountains,<br> or the bottle of potassium.<br> I'll be back in an hour or so.<br> I'll be in my father's room.<br> All right, I love you!<br> My God!<br> I repeat, I'm asking you<br> to come out peacefully.<br> These buildings are condemned<br> and unfit for habitation.<br> You people are possessing<br> this building illegally...<br> and in violation of the law.<br> I'm asking you to come out peacefully.<br> So the hospital has assumed<br> the responsibility...<br> for finding 400 housing units<br> in good buildings.<br> The hospital wishes to point out<br> that this row of buildings on First Avenue...<br> was condemned by the city<br> before the hospital acquired ownership...<br> and even then...<br> only after responsible leaders<br> in the community...<br> approved the building<br> of our new drug-rehabilitation center.<br> God damn it. I've got a dozen community<br> leaders waiting for me in the library.<br> We're trying to work out<br> a negotiable formula for two years...<br> with no help from you people<br> in the Urban Affairs Division, I might add.<br> I am not going to throw<br> all that down the drain...<br> because some cockamamie activist group...<br> is showboating for the television cameras.<br> You get those people out of those buildings<br> before a wall collapses...<br> or a fire breaks out<br> and we've got a riot on our hands.<br> Okay.<br> Having your troubles?<br> I won't take much of your time.<br> My name is Welbeck.<br> I've been associated with this hospital<br> for six years...<br> and yesterday afternoon,<br> Dr. Gilley called me...<br> to tell me he was cutting off my privileges<br> with the hospital.<br> - Do you know anything about that?<br> - That's news to me.<br> - He said he sent the report on.<br> - I'll probably get the report tomorrow.<br> - I assume...<br> - A report about what?<br> I'm not sure myself.<br> I did a nephrectomy on a man<br> about seven days ago.<br> Emergency called in at 4:00 a.m.,<br> and the man was hemorrhaging...<br> I'm really sorry.<br> I do have a meeting to go to.<br> In any event,<br> there's nothing I can do about it.<br> If Gilley... I'll be in the library.<br> If Gilley wants to cut your privileges...<br> he's Chief of Surgery,<br> it's within his province.<br> You'll have to have the hearing.<br> I have a laparotomy for today.<br> I assume I'll be able to go through with that.<br> I've been connected with this hospital<br> for six years.<br> It seems to me I've had your name<br> down here before, for something.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You're the fellow...<br> with the Medicaid collecting business...<br> who incorporated and went public, right?<br> Something like that?<br> Milton Mead was telling me about you.<br> You're a whole medical conglomerate.<br> You've got a factoring service,<br> a computerized billing company...<br> a few proprietary hospitals,<br> a few nursing homes.<br> Good heavens, you shouldn't be brought up<br> before a committee of mere doctors.<br> You should be investigated by<br> the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br> You have to go through with the hearing.<br> I can't do anything about that.<br> ...imperializing the Blacks.<br> We reject the bourgeois,<br> middle-class Black traitors and flunkies...<br> who are selling out the Black proletarians...<br> - to the expansionist, racist policies...<br> - Let's get back to the abortion issue.<br> What the hell does the male establishment<br> know about abortion?<br> Who the hell<br> raised the issue of birth control?<br> The issue at hand<br> is the control of drug addiction...<br> in this community<br> and in the ghetto, personally.<br> - We don't want no goddamn abortion.<br> - Let's get to the core of this matter.<br> The point is that this hospital<br> is the landlord for those buildings...<br> and instead of tearing them down...<br> and building some imperialistic extensions<br> of the medical establishment...<br> this hospital ought to be rebuilding<br> those tenements...<br> - give those people decent housing.<br> - Please.<br> You know, I hallucinated last night.<br> I hallucinated there was an Indian<br> doing a war dance in here.<br> You werert hallucinating, Mr. Mead.<br> - There was an Indian in here last night.<br> - There was?<br> Okay. Down to the Operating Room.<br> Dr. Norris said about half an hour.<br> - Okay. Coming up fine.<br> - Half an hour.<br> - Hold him right there.<br> - Miss Shirley...<br> it's just an ovarian cyst.<br> Okay. Go up to Holly 6...<br> on the double. Go.<br> Who is that? Is that Mangafranni?<br> Yeah. Number 3.<br> Good morning, Doctor.<br> It's legal for a doctor<br> to incorporate in New York, isn't it?<br> Since last September.<br> If they'd had that when I was your age,<br> I'd have put away a couple of million.<br> It gives you a variety of deferral devices.<br> Profit sharing, for example.<br> Let's say you pick yourself<br> an October 31 fiscal.<br> You declare a bonus payable in '71.<br> An accrued item payable<br> to a principal shareholder must be paid...<br> within two and a half months after the year<br> end, to get the deduction in the prior year.<br> But your corporation doesn't pay that tax...<br> because we've eliminated<br> the taxable income with the bonus.<br> With two taxable entities,<br> you can bury a lot of expenses.<br> Hello, this is Welbeck.<br> Any messages for me?<br> I'm at the hospital.<br> I gotta cut open some guy soon.<br> I'll try to make it as fast as I can.<br> How urgent did he say it was?<br> Doctor Hogan made those arrangements<br> with the underwriters.<br> The registration statement<br> was filed with the SEC well over a year ago.<br> If he calls again, have me paged here.<br> - Mangafranni, right?<br> - Right.<br> What do you say?<br> We're not gonna hang it in the Louvre.<br> There's no pulse, Doctor.<br> - What's the pressure?<br> - There's no blood pressure.<br> No pulse. Get the tube and EKG.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I can't feel a thing here.<br> - What the hell happened?<br> - I don't know.<br> She must have thrown an embolus.<br> She was doing fine, up to now.<br> - Did you check the gases?<br> - I did.<br> 'Cause the only time<br> I saw anyone conk out...<br> some jerk switched the nitrous oxide<br> and the gas lines.<br> Get the damn leads on.<br> For Christ's sake, what the hell is this?<br> She's a young woman.<br> Should we open the chest?<br> - She's 53, you button-head.<br> - Bicarb.<br> Jesus H. Christ!<br> Stop for a minute.<br> - V-fib, Doctor.<br> - Get me the paddles.<br> I may be crazy, Doctor,<br> but I don't think this is your patient.<br> What the hell are you talking about?<br> I don't want to get into an intestine hassle.<br> The malpractice here is monumental.<br> As you can see,<br> Dr. Schaefer's blood sugar was 23.<br> No glucose solution is going to do that.<br> The only thing that'll do it...<br> is at least 50 units of insulin,<br> probably more.<br> We must presume one of the nurses shot 50<br> units of insulin into his bloodstream...<br> either by injection or IV, although<br> how in God's name a thing like that...<br> I'm very sorry, Doctor.<br> - May I use your phone?<br> - Certainly.<br> Did you ask the head nurse<br> from eighth to tell you...<br> - when a Miss Drummond got here?<br> - Yes.<br> - She just got there.<br> - I better get down there directly.<br> Have you called the OOD?<br> You better call Dr. Gilley.<br> And call Mr. Sloan.<br> I'll be right down.<br> I'm very sorry.<br> There's a very nasty one in the OR.<br> They've just operated on the wrong patient.<br> I don't understand. Is she back in her room?<br> When did she get back in her room?<br> Who brought her back?<br> She's back in her room.<br> - Who?<br> - Mrs. Mangafranni...<br> the woman who was<br> supposed to have been operated on.<br> Are they still working on that woman in 3?<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Fried,<br> could you say that again?<br> Nobody in this office sent her back up.<br> All right, Mrs. Fried.<br> I'll have to call you back.<br> Did any of you take a woman patient<br> named Mangafranni...<br> out of the holding room,<br> back up to Holly 5, around 10:00?<br> - What happened?<br> - I don't know what happened.<br> A patient named Mangafranni<br> was scheduled to have a hysterectomy...<br> at 10:00. Dr. Mallory.<br> I talked to Sylvia, in the holding room,<br> who admitted her, so she was here.<br> Now I just spoke to Mrs. Fried on Holly 5...<br> and she says an orderly<br> brought Mrs. Mangafranni...<br> back to her room about 20 minutes ago.<br> Now Mrs. Mangafranni<br> is in her room, sleeping.<br> - Who's the woman in the operating room?<br> - I don't know.<br> Is she dead?<br> They had to open her up,<br> and that's not good.<br> I better get Mr. Mead.<br> Now, we can rectify the injustices...<br> of the world tomorrow, but right now...<br> could we get those people<br> out of those buildings?<br> Will you please listen to me?<br> Will you shut up?<br> Will you please shut up and listen to me?<br> Let's call a halt to this...<br> participatory democracy...<br> and address ourselves<br> to the immediate problem!<br> - When did it happen?<br> - About half an hour.<br> - Called the Medical Examiner?<br> - No.<br> You'd better do that now.<br> Call the precinct station house, too.<br> Good morning.<br> This is really something, isn't it?<br> I thought she looked different<br> when they brought her.<br> I said to one of the nurses,<br> "She looks younger without her dentures."<br> I talked to her half an hour before.<br> Does anyone know who she is?<br> What's her chart say?<br> Her chart and her bracelet<br> say "Mangafranni."<br> The only thing that isn't Mangafranni<br> is the woman.<br> Jesus H. Christ!<br> I've been chopping out<br> is it too much to expect<br> you people to bring in...<br> the right goddamn Jesus Christ uterus?<br> I talked to her in the holding room.<br> She was perfectly fine. A little drowsy.<br> I thought it was funny that<br> when they brought her in, she was out cold.<br> We'll have to stay here till Mr. Mead<br> or someone from the OOD comes back.<br> I'm not taking the rap for this.<br> I've got one malpractice suit pending.<br> I'm not taking the rap for this one.<br> You're not leaving.<br> I love you, and I'm not gonna let you go.<br> Let's start putting your father's things back.<br> He's staying here.<br> I'll find you an apartment.<br> I'm staying in a filthy little hotel room.<br> We can't use that.<br> I can't make it, up here. I'll crack up.<br> I can retain my sanity<br> only in a simple society.<br> You can't really expect me...<br> to live in a grass shack and hunt jackrabbit.<br> - Be sensible, for God's sake.<br> - I am being sensible.<br> What is it you're so afraid of leaving here?<br> Your plastic home?<br> Your conditioned air?<br> Your synthetic clothes? Your instant food?<br> I'm offering you green silence, and solitude.<br> The natural order of things.<br> Mostly, I'm offering me.<br> I think we're beautiful.<br> You make it sound almost plausible.<br> I don't know why you even hesitate.<br> What's holding you here?<br> Is it your wife?<br> That's all over.<br> If I'm married to anything, it's this hospital.<br> It's been my whole life.<br> I can't walk out on it<br> as though it never mattered.<br> I'm middle class.<br> Among us middle class,<br> love doesn't triumph over all...<br> responsibility does.<br> Don't ask me to stay up here with you,<br> because I love you, and I will.<br> And we'll both be destroyed.<br> I have the bill here to pay, yet.<br> I'll come with you.<br> You wanted to know the name<br> of that dialysis nurse?<br> Who?<br> The one who goofed<br> on your patient, Drummond.<br> Her name is Teresa Campanella.<br> You're not gonna believe this.<br> She died on the operating table of OR 3<br> about an hour ago.<br> - What?<br> - You heard about the screwup in OR 3.<br> - You mean she was the one?<br> - I just identified her.<br> What is going on?<br> Every time I try to find somebody,<br> they either died of a heart attack...<br> or anesthesia shock in an OR.<br> I just came from the OR.<br> They're trying to find a Dr. Schaefer.<br> Doesrt a kid named Schaefer work here?<br> Did. He died yesterday<br> of an overdose of insulin. Why?<br> The nurse says there's a Dr. Schaefer<br> hanging around the holding room.<br> Wouldrt have been your Schaefer.<br> Nurse says it was senior staff,<br> middle-aged man.<br> There's no senior staff by that name.<br> I told them that. I said, "I don't know<br> any senior staff named Schaefer."<br> They've got detectives down there.<br> A whole big investigation.<br> - How'd the nurse know his name?<br> - His nameplate.<br> I am the fool for Christ,<br> and Paraclete of Caborca.<br> For heavers sakes, Dad.<br> What the hell's going on?<br> We thought you were at death's door.<br> What are you doing out of bed?<br> What happened?<br> What's he going at you for?<br> Did he say anything?<br> As a matter of fact...<br> he said, "I am the fool for Christ<br> and the Paraclete of Caborca."<br> Shut that door,<br> because if he tells everybody...<br> he's the fool for Christ and the Paraclete<br> of Caborca, they'll put us all away.<br> He's killed two doctors and a nurse.<br> I am the wrath of the lamb,<br> and the angel of the bottomless pit.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean he's killed two doctors and a nurse.<br> He just tried to kill me.<br> He has something against doctors.<br> He got ahold of some insulin and put it<br> in Dr. Schaefer's intravenous solution.<br> Somehow, he got Dr. Ives<br> to die of a heart attack...<br> in the middle of the Emergency Room.<br> Somehow, he got a dialysis nurse,<br> Campanella...<br> to die of anesthesia shock<br> on an operating table.<br> He's been running all over the hospital,<br> dressed up in Dr. Schaefer's uniform.<br> They're looking all over the place<br> for the mysterious Dr. Schaefer.<br> It's incredible to us both, but as you can<br> see, your father is not a helpless comatose.<br> I'm not the one who's crazy.<br> Ask your crazy father.<br> I was merely an instrument of God.<br> I kill no one.<br> They all three died by their own hands.<br> Ritual victims of their own institutions...<br> murdered by irony.<br> "An eye for an eye."<br> Biblical retribution.<br> Schaefer was first, because he killed God.<br> God was admitted<br> to this hospital last Monday...<br> under the name of Guernsey.<br> I was instantly aware of a divine presence.<br> I was convinced this porcelain old man<br> was an angel of the Lord...<br> perhaps even Christ himself.<br> Our savior was suffering from emphysema.<br> He was relentlessly subjected<br> to the benefits of modern medicine...<br> and died at 7:30 that evening.<br> A few hours later,<br> he appeared to me in a revelation.<br> Rise up, Drummond.<br> You are dead, now you are restored.<br> Those who killed you,<br> and those who killed me...<br> will die in our place.<br> You are the Paraclete of Caborca.<br> The wrath of the lamb.<br> The angel...<br> of the bottomless pit.<br> Not quite the burning bush, perhaps,<br> but prodigal enough for me.<br> I was to avenge the death of God,<br> and my own brutalization.<br> I was to kill doctors Schaefer,<br> Ives, and Welbeck...<br> and the dialysis nurse, Miss Campanella...<br> whose negligence caused my coma.<br> I awaited a further sign from God,<br> which was given to me later that evening.<br> Dr. Schaefer had arranged an assignation...<br> with a girl from the Hematology Lab<br> named Sheila.<br> Boy, I sure hope nobody walks in.<br> - What about him?<br> - He's zonked out.<br> - What's new?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What's this?<br> - It's my insulin.<br> I forgot to put it back.<br> What's the insulin for?<br> I didn't know you were a diabetic.<br> It ain't contagious, don't worry.<br> You took the insulin from Dr. Schaefer's<br> pocket and put it in the IV.<br> Yes.<br> Then a nurse came...<br> and plugged the IVjar into Schaefer.<br> God clearly intended<br> a measure of irony here.<br> The hospital was to do all the killing for me.<br> All I need do is arrange for the doctors<br> to become patients in their own hospital.<br> The next morning,<br> I pinched some digoxin from the pharmacy...<br> and a sandbag from a utility can't...<br> and found my way to Dr. Ives' laboratory.<br> I crushed him with the sandbag...<br> and gave him a massive shot of the digoxin.<br> This brought on an instant condition<br> of cardiac arrhythmia.<br> I waited for him to come to.<br> Then I brought him down<br> to the Emergency Room.<br> He had, at that time, perhaps an hour to live.<br> Prompt treatment would've saved his life.<br> He was suddenly taken ill.<br> I got him here right away.<br> As a staff doctor,<br> he was seen without preliminaries.<br> His vital signs were taken.<br> An electrocardiogram...<br> which revealed occasional<br> ventricular premature contractions.<br> An intern took his history,<br> and then he was...<br> promptly, simply...<br> forgotten to death.<br> Simply mislaid.<br> Mislaid among the broken wrists...<br> the chest pains, the scalp lacerations...<br> the man whose fingers<br> were crushed in a taxi door...<br> the infant with a skin rash,<br> the child swiped by a car...<br> the old lady mugged in the subway,<br> the derelict beaten by sailors...<br> the teenage suicide, the paranoids...<br> drunks, asthmatics, the rapes,<br> the septic abortions...<br> the overdosed addicts...<br> the fractures, infarcts, hemorrhages,<br> concussions, boils, abrasions...<br> the colonic cancers, the cardiac arrests...<br> the whole wounded madhouse of our times.<br> Who's Number 7680202-S?<br> Is there anybody here who is that number?<br> In this way...<br> was it revealed to me<br> the manner of Nurse Campanella's death.<br> She was to die<br> of the great American plague:<br> Vestigial identity.<br> So, last night I crushed Miss Campanella<br> with a sandbag...<br> sedated her with Thorazine,<br> shaved her, prepped her...<br> and parked her in a corridor<br> of the x-ray department for five hours.<br> - Why x-ray?<br> - At x-ray...<br> a sedated body lying around<br> unattended for five hours...<br> - wouldn't seem unusual.<br> - Of course.<br> Her operation, that is to say...<br> Mrs. Mangafranni's operation,<br> was not scheduled till 9:30.<br> At 9:15 this morning, I rang for my nurse.<br> Rang for your nurse?<br> To insure one full hour<br> of uninterrupted privacy.<br> I got up, wheeled Miss Campanella<br> off to the operating rooms...<br> I exchanged<br> Mrs. Mangafranni's bed with hers.<br> I transferred the charts<br> and identity bracelets.<br> She died officially of anesthesia shock.<br> In fact, she died because she was wearing<br> another womars identity.<br> God, what do we do now?<br> Let me take him back to Mexico.<br> It's a simple world there. He functions there.<br> If you turn him in...<br> they'll cage him in the Rockland<br> State Hospital for the criminally insane.<br> - Let me take him back.<br> - Are you kidding?<br> We'll both take him. I'm going with you.<br> Let's get him dressed.<br> We'll leave before the police<br> put us all in Rockland State.<br> I haven't finished my work here.<br> I have this Welbeck to dispose of.<br> I'm the angel of the bottomless pit,<br> and the wrath of the lamb.<br> He's having another revelation.<br> That ambulance must be there by now.<br> You go and get them.<br> I'll give him a shot of something.<br> We'll go to the airport in the ambulance.<br> You're hallucinating again.<br> Powell never showed up.<br> I'm short-staffed as hell.<br> It's just me and Alice.<br> - It's like a Sunday. Nobody's here.<br> - I'll be in with the bleeder.<br> You gotta send me somebody.<br> We'll be in 806.<br> Then what did she say?<br> I'm Dr. Welbeck. I have a patient<br> on this floor named Drummond.<br> I'd like to see his chart.<br> Dr. Bock, can I have a few minutes<br> of your time?<br> Dr. Gilley tells me that you initiated<br> these proceedings against me.<br> - I'm busy.<br> - What is it you have against me?<br> Eight days ago you showed up half-stoned<br> for a simple nephrectomy...<br> botched it, put the patient in failure,<br> and damn near killed him.<br> Then, pausing only to send in your bill,<br> you flew off on the wings of Man...<br> to an island of sun in Montego Bay.<br> This is the third time in two years<br> we've had to patch up your patients.<br> The other two died.<br> You're greedy, unfeeling, inept, indifferent...<br> self-inflating,<br> and unconscionably profitable.<br> Besides that, I have nothing against you.<br> I'm sure you play a hell of a game of golf.<br> What else do you want to know?<br> How much do you make a year?<br> For a guy who makes<br> a lousy $40 to $50,000...<br> This is Dr. Welbeck. Were you paging me?<br> You've been trying to reach me all morning.<br> He pulls out the wires and the tubes...<br> and he gets up and he puts on<br> a doctor's uniform, and he murders doctors.<br> He just went out<br> I'll tell you something else<br> about this crazy place.<br> There was a naked Indian here, last night,<br> doing a war dance.<br> That's the kind of crazy place<br> you're running here.<br> You gotta get me out of here.<br> This is a crazy place.<br> Listen to me.<br> I wake up last night and there was<br> an Indian in here, a naked Indian!<br> - What kind of a hospital is this?<br> - Are you paging me?<br> Sometime later, the guy in that bed there<br> is getting out.<br> Are the police still here? Get them up here.<br> All day, he lays there like he's dead.<br> In the middle of the night,<br> he gets out of bed! Thought I was crazy!<br> He says, "You're hallucinating."<br> I just... Listen. I saw a naked Indian,<br> now I'm seeing a ghost.<br> I figure he's right, I'm hallucinating.<br> I'll be down soon.<br> It never rains, but it pours.<br> A fire broke out in one of the buildings.<br> The squatters came out.<br> The police tried to arrest them.<br> Now the situation has erupted into a riot.<br> - You must be wondering what this is about.<br> - Don't leave me alone here!<br> Mr. Hitchcock will stay with you.<br> Better call the cops, Tom.<br> I haven't time now.<br> I'm not gonna try to tell you this crazy story<br> my brother just told me.<br> I'll fill you in on it at lunch, sometime.<br> - Hold it!<br> - The ambulance is here.<br> But your father isn't. Disappeared.<br> He put on Schaefer's uniform<br> and took off to do God's work...<br> presumably the murder of Dr. Welbeck.<br> - The guy on the phone is Dr. Welbeck.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Also, the other patient in your father's room<br> just overheard the whole confession...<br> and told the Chief Administrator.<br> They're sending for the cops.<br> Oh, my God. Who held title?<br> Do the underwriters know about this yet?<br> What are you waiting for?<br> Arrest the son of a bitch. Turn him in.<br> Oh, my God! When?<br> Call me right back.
