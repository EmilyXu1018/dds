It's not easy.<br> I know.<br> It did take him<br> ten years to write.<br> Maybe it just takes<br> another ten to read.<br> It's you, isn't it?<br> What is?<br> In the novel,<br> isn't it meant to be you?<br> Oh, I see.<br> Yeah.<br> Sort of.<br> I mean, in a way.<br> You know, Richard's a writer.<br> That's what he is.<br> He uses things<br> which actually happen.<br> Yeah.<br> And years ago,<br> he and I were students.<br> That's true.<br> But, you know,<br> then he changes things.<br> Oh, sure.<br> I don't mean in a bad way.<br> It's more like...<br> he makes them his own.<br> A woman's whole life...<br> in a single day,<br> just one day...<br> and in that day,<br> her whole life.<br> This is what we need.<br> Shortening...<br> Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.<br> Yes, it's me!<br> Oh... It's me.<br> Come in.<br> Richard,<br> it's a beautiful morning.<br> How about we let in<br> a little more light?<br> Is it still morning?<br> Yes, it is.<br> Have I died?<br> Good morning, my dear.<br> Any visitors?<br> Yes.<br> Are they still here?<br> No. They've gone.<br> Mm. How'd they look?<br> Today?<br> Sort of like black fire.<br> I mean, sort of light<br> and dark at the same time.<br> There was one a bit<br> like an electrified jellyfish.<br> They were singing.<br> May have been Greek.<br> So the ceremony is at 5:00.<br> Do you remember?<br> And then...<br> the party is right after.<br> They did bring you breakfast,<br> didn't they?<br> What a question. Of course.<br> Richard, you did eat it?<br> Well, can you see it?<br> Is it here?<br> Any breakfast lying around?<br> No, I don't see it.<br> Well, then I must have<br> eaten it, mustn't I?<br> I suppose.<br> Does it matter?<br> Of course, it matters.<br> You know what the doctors say.<br> Have you been skipping pills?<br> Clarissa, I can't take this.<br> Take what?<br> Having to be proud and brave<br> in front of everybody.<br> Oh. Honey, it's not<br> a performance.<br> Of course it is.<br> I got the prize<br> for my performance.<br> Well, that is<br> nonsense.<br> I got the prize for having AIDS<br> and going nuts<br> and being brave about it.<br> I actually got the prize<br> for having come through.<br> It's not true.<br> - For surviving, that's what<br> - It's not true.<br> I got the prize for.<br> Oh, you think they<br> would have given it to me<br> if I were healthy?<br> Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.<br> Is it here somewhere?<br> What?<br> The prize.<br> I'd like to look at it.<br> No, you haven't gotten it yet.<br> It's tonight.<br> Are you sure?<br> Um...<br> I remember<br> the ceremony perfectly.<br> I seem to have<br> fallen out of time.<br> Richard.<br> Richard...<br> it's a party,<br> and it's only a party.<br> Hmm?

Excuse me!<br> Mr. Woolf, what an<br> unexpected pleasure.<br> Perhaps you could tell me<br> exactly what you think<br> you're doing?<br> What I was doing?<br> I went to look for you,<br> and you weren't there.<br> You were working in the garden.<br> I didn't wish to disturb you.<br> You disturb me<br> when you disappear.<br> I didn't disappear.<br> I went for a walk.<br> A walk?!<br> Is that all?<br> Just a walk?<br> Virginia, we must go home now.<br> Nelly's cooking dinner.<br> She's already had<br> a very difficult day.<br> It's just our obligation<br> to eat Nelly's dinner.<br> There is no such<br> obligation.<br> No such obligation exists.<br> Virginia,<br> you have an obligation<br> to your own sanity.<br> I have endured this custody!<br> I have endured<br> this imprisonment.<br> Oh, Virginia!<br> I am attended by<br> doctors, everywhere.<br> I am attended by doctors<br> who inform me of<br> my own interests!<br> They know your interests.<br> They do not!<br> They do not speak<br> for my interests.<br> Virginia, I can...<br> I can see that it must be<br> hard for a woman of your...<br> - Of what? Of my what, exactly?<br> - Uh, your...<br> your talents to see<br> that she may not be<br> the best judge<br> of her own condition!<br> Who, then, is a better judge?<br> You have a history!<br> You have a history<br> of confinement.<br> We brought you to Richmond<br> because you have a history<br> of fits, moods, blackouts,<br> hearing voices.<br> We brought you here<br> to save you<br> from the irrevocable damage<br> you intended upon yourself.<br> You've tried to kill yourself<br> twice!<br> I live daily with that threat.<br> I set up the press...<br> we set up the printing press<br> not just for itself,<br> not just purely for itself,<br> but so that you might have<br> a ready source<br> of absorption and of remedy.<br> Like needlework?<br> It was done for you!<br> It was done for your betterment!<br> It was done out of love!<br> If I didn't know you better,<br> I'd call this ingratitude.<br> I am ungrateful?<br> You call me ungrateful?<br> My life has been stolen from me.<br> I'm living in a town<br> I have no wish to live in.<br> I'm living... a life<br> I have no wish to live.<br> How did this happen?<br> It is time for us<br> to move back to London.<br> I miss London.<br> I miss London life.<br> This is not you speaking,<br> Virginia.<br> This is an aspect<br> of your illness.<br> - It's not you.<br> - It is me. It is my voice.<br> It's not your voice.<br> It's mine and mine alone.<br> This is the voice<br> that you hear.<br> It is not! It is mine!<br> I'm dying in this town!<br> If you were thinking clearly,<br> Virginia,<br> you'd recall it was London<br> that brought you low.<br> If I were thinking clearly...<br> If I were thinking clearly...<br> We brought you to Richmond<br> to give you peace.<br> If I were thinking clearly,<br> Leonard,<br> I would tell you that I wrestle<br> alone in the dark,<br> in the deep dark,<br> and that only I can know,<br> only I can understand<br> my own condition.<br> You live with the threat...<br> you tell me...<br> you live with the threat<br> of my extinction.<br> Leonard, I live with it,<br> too.<br> This is my right.<br> It is the right<br> of every human being.<br> I choose not the suffocating<br> anesthetic of the suburbs,<br> but the violent jolt<br> of the capital.<br> That is my choice.<br> The meanest patient,<br> yes, even the very lowest<br> is allowed some say<br> in the matter of her own<br> prescription.<br> Thereby she defines<br> her humanity.<br> I wish, for your sake, Leonard,<br> I could be happy in this<br> quietness.<br> But if it is a choice between<br> Richmond and death,<br> I choose death.<br> Very well, London, then.<br> We'll go back to London.<br> You hungry?<br> I'm a little hungry myself.<br> Come along.<br> London train on platform one!<br> This is the London train<br> terminating at Vauxhall.<br> You cannot find peace<br> by avoiding life, Leonard.<br> This is the London train!<br> London train on platform one!<br> Mommy!<br> Mommy!<br> Hey. Hey, there, bug.<br> Hey, what's wrong?<br> Hi, Mrs. Latch.<br> Sorry I'm late.<br> He's fine.<br> He's been fine.<br> He's, he's just happy<br> to see you.<br> Aw, it couldn't have been<br> that bad, could it? Hmm?<br> So, you got it cut, then?<br> Oh, yes, yes. No problem.<br> Looks great.<br> Well, they didn't have<br> to do very much.<br> Well, we had a fine time<br> together.<br> Thank you very much.<br> So, that wasn't too bad, was it?<br> I wasn't gone too long.<br> No, you weren't long.<br> That's right.<br> At one point...<br> I don't know.<br> There was a moment where<br> I thought I might be longer.<br> But I changed my mind.<br> What is it, honey?<br> Mommy, I love you.<br> I love you, too, baby.<br> What's wrong?<br> What?<br> Don't worry, honey,<br> everything's fine.<br> We're going to have<br> a wonderful party,<br> and we've made your daddy<br> such a nice cake.<br> I love you, sweetheart.<br> You're my guy.<br> Mommy!<br> Mommy!<br> Richard, it's me. I'm early.<br> What the hell is going on?<br> Richard!<br> What are you doing here?<br> You're early!<br> Wha-What is going on here?<br> What are you doing?<br> L-I had this wonderful idea.<br> I needed some light.<br> I needed to let in some light!<br> Richard, what are you doing?<br> I had this fantastic notion.<br> I took the Xanax<br> and the Ritalin together.<br> It-it never occurred to me.<br> Richard...<br> Don't come near me!<br> It seemed to me I needed<br> to let in some light.<br> What do you think?<br> I cleared away all the windows.<br> All right, Richard,<br> do me one simple favor.<br> Come. Come sit.<br> I don't think I can make it<br> to the party, Clarissa.<br> You don't have to go<br> to the party.<br> You don't have to go<br> to the ceremony.<br> You don't have to do anything<br> you don't want to do.<br> You can do as you like.<br> But I still have to face<br> the hours, don't I?<br> I mean, the hours<br> after the party,<br> and the hours after that...<br> You do have good days still.<br> You know you do.<br> Not really.<br> I mean, it's kind of you<br> to say so, but it's...<br> I mean, it's kind of you<br> to say so, but it's...<br> not really true.<br> Are they here?<br> Who?<br> The voices.<br> Oh, the voices are always here.<br> And it's the voices that you're<br> hearing now, isn't it?<br> No, no, no, no.<br> Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.<br> I've stayed alive for you,<br> but now you have to let me go.<br> Richard, I...<br> No, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br> Wait.<br> Tell me a story.<br> What about?<br> Tell me a story from your day.<br> I, um...<br> l-I got up...<br> Yes?<br> ...and I went out, and, uh,<br> I went to buy flowers,<br> Like Mrs. Dalloway,<br> in the book, you know?<br> Yes.<br> And it was a beautiful morning.<br> Was it?<br> Yes, it was so beautiful.<br> It was so fresh.<br> Oh, fresh, was it?<br> Yes.<br> Like a...<br> like a morning on the beach?<br> Yes.<br> Like that?<br> Yes.<br> Like that morning when you<br> walked out of that old house,<br> and you were, you were 18,<br> and maybe I was 19.<br> Yes.<br> I was 19 years old,<br> and I'd never seen<br> anything so beautiful.<br> You...<br> coming out of a glass door<br> in the early morning,<br> still sleepy.<br> Isn't it strange?<br> Most ordinary morning<br> in anybody's life.<br> I'm afraid I can't make it<br> to the party, Clarissa.<br> The party...<br> doesn't matter.<br> You've been so good to me,<br> Mrs. Dalloway.<br> I love you.<br> "I don't think two people<br> could've been happier<br> than we've been."<br> Oh, God, no!<br> Happy birthday.<br> Happy birthday, Dan.<br> This is perfect.<br> This is just perfect.<br> Oh, do you think so?<br> Do you really think so?<br> Why, sure.<br> You must've been<br> working all day.<br> Well, that's what<br> we were doing.<br> Weren't we, bug?<br> Been working all day.<br> This is just fantastic.<br> It's what I've always wanted.<br> Oh, Dan.<br> One day, Richie, I'll tell you.<br> I'll tell you<br> how it all happened.<br> Don't.<br> I want to.<br> I want to tell him the story.<br> What happened...<br> when I was in the war.<br> At war, I found myself<br> thinking about this girl<br> that I had seen...<br> I had never met her...<br> at high school,<br> this... strange,<br> fragile-Iooking girl<br> named Laura McGrath.<br> Yeah.<br> And she was shy...<br> and she was interesting.<br> And... well,<br> your mother won't mind if<br> I tell you this, Richie.<br> She was the sort of<br> girl that you see<br> sitting mostly on her own.<br> And I'll tell you...<br> sometimes, when I was<br> in the South Pacific,<br> the fact is<br> that I used to think<br> about this girl.<br> Dan.<br> I used to think<br> about bringing her to a house,<br> to a life.<br> Pretty much like this.<br> And it was the thought<br> of the happiness...<br> the thought of this woman,<br> the thought of this life...<br> that's what kept me going.<br> I had an idea of our happiness.<br> Why does someone have to die?<br> Leonard...<br> In your book,<br> you said someone had to die.<br> Hmm.<br> Why?<br> Is that a stupid question?<br> No.<br> I imagine my question is stupid.<br> Not at all.<br> Well?<br> Someone has to die<br> in order that the rest of us<br> should value life more.<br> It's contrast.<br> And who will die?<br> Tell me.<br> The poet will die.<br> The visionary.<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm brushing my teeth.<br> Are you coming to bed?<br> Yeah, in a minute.<br> Come to bed, Laura Brown.<br> I ran into Ray.<br> He said Kitty had to<br> go to the hospital.<br> I know.<br> Nothing serious.<br> He said just a checkup.<br> I'm terrified.<br> Why?<br> Only I knew<br> that she could disappear.<br> Maybe you could<br> go see her<br> in the morning, honey.<br> I was going to.<br> I was going to stop by.<br> I've had a wonderful day,<br> and I have you to thank.<br> Come to bed, honey.<br> I'm coming.<br> Are you coming?<br> Yes.<br> What?<br> I was hoping<br> you were going to bed.<br> I am.<br> I am going to bed.<br> What, then?<br> All else is clear.<br> The outline of the story<br> is planned,<br> now one thing only.<br> Mrs. Dalloway's destiny<br> must be resolved.<br> You're Laura Brown.<br> Yes, I'm Richard's mother.<br> Of course.<br> I'm Clarissa Vaughan.<br> Please come in.<br> My friend Sally<br> is in the kitchen,<br> and my daughter.<br> I'll take this.<br> We were having a party.<br> We were going to have a party.<br> I was lucky.<br> I got the last plane<br> from Toronto.<br> So, that's the monster.<br> Hope I did the right thing.<br> I found your number<br> in his phone book.<br> Yes, he had it.<br> We didn't speak often.<br> It's a terrible thing,<br> Miss Vaughan... to outlive<br> your whole family.<br> Richard's father died.<br> Yes, he-he died of cancer<br> quite young.<br> And Richard's sister is dead.<br> Obviously, you...<br> feel unworthy.<br> Gives you feelings<br> of unworthiness.<br> You survive and they don't.<br> Have you read the poems?<br> Oh, yes. Oh...<br> I also read the novel.<br> You see, uh, people say<br> the novel is difficult.<br> Uh... I know.<br> They say that.<br> I know.<br> He had me die in the novel.<br> L-l-I know why he did that.<br> It hurt, of course.<br> I can't pretend it didn't hurt,<br> but I...<br> I know why he did it.<br> You left Richard<br> when he was a child.<br> I left both my children.<br> I abandoned them.<br> They say it's the worst thing<br> a mother can do.<br> You have a daughter.<br> Yes...<br> But I never met Julia's father.<br> You so wanted a child.<br> That's right.<br> You're a lucky woman.<br> There are times<br> when you don't belong,<br> and you think you're going<br> to kill yourself.<br> Once, I went to a hotel.<br> Later that night, I made a plan.<br> The plan was<br> I would leave my family<br> when my second child was born...<br> and that's what I did.<br> I got up one morning,<br> made breakfast,<br> went to the bus stop,<br> got on a bus.<br> I'd left a note.<br> I got a job in a library<br> in Canada.<br> It would...<br> be wonderful to say<br> you regretted it.<br> It would be easy.<br> But what does it mean?<br> What does it mean to regret...<br> when you have no choice?<br> It's what you can bear.<br> There it is.<br> No one's going to forgive me.<br> It was death.<br> I chose life.<br> Time to take your coat off.<br> I thought you might like<br> a cup of tea.<br> Oh my goodness.<br> Thank you, dear.<br> I feel like I'm stealing<br> your room.<br> Um, we put the food away,<br> so, if you're at all hungry<br> in the night,<br> just help yourself.<br> Oh, I will.<br> Where will you sleep?<br> Oh, the sofa.<br> Oh, oh, I'm sorry.<br> Good night, sweetheart.<br> Good night.<br> "Dear Leonard,<br> "to look life in the face...<br> "always to look life<br> in the face,<br> "and to know it for what it is.<br> "At last, to know it,<br> "to love it for what it is,<br> "and then...<br> "to put it away.<br> "Leonard...<br> "always the years between us,<br> "always the years...<br> "always... the love...<br> "always...<br> the hours."<br>
