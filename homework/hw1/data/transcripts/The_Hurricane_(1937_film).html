                        Doctor, the captain told me<br> we were in the South Seas now.<br> Right in the heart of them.<br> That's right, madame.<br> The South Sea islands.<br> The last hiding place<br> of beauty and adventure.<br> That's what all<br> the travel folders say.<br> l thought you'd been here before,<br> and that you adored the islands.<br> Yes, l do in my own way.<br> What's that wretched-looking spot<br> we're passing?<br> lt's one of the South Sea isles.<br> Nothing like that is mentioned<br> in the folders.<br> Well, it's a little in disrepute.<br> lt was mentioned<br> in all the folders once.<br> That silly-looking sand waste?<br> Has it a name?<br> lt's the island of Manukura.<br> That was once the most beautiful<br> of all the islands...<br> that raised their little green heads<br> above these waters.<br> The most beautiful and enchanting<br> bit of paradise in all the world.<br> l always throw it a kiss<br> when l pass it.<br> Excuse me, madame.<br> What happened to it?<br> lt made the mistake of being born<br> in the heart of the hurricane belt.<br> You've stolen a canoe.<br> Stealing is against the law.<br> You must pay the penalty<br> for breaking the law.<br> You are sentenced<br> to 30 days punishment.<br> When you have finished 30 days, you will<br> know better than to break the law again.<br> l don't understand.<br> He says...<br> He's defending himself against the power<br> of the French government and very ably.<br> Does he deny the theft?<br> No. He offers in rebuttal<br> that there was moonlight.<br> An awful lot of it.<br> And his lady love says...<br> she saw a gold fish in the sea.<br> My dear doctor...<br> l am as sensitive to the whims of love<br> as the next man.<br> But as governor of these islands,<br> l cannot afford...<br> to sit 'round admiring<br> the quaint and the curious.<br> Thirty days, my good fellow.<br> lt's not exactly my business,<br> de Laage...<br> but you've only been here a year.<br> Whereas l, indolent wretch...<br> have spent a pitifully long time<br> on these islands.<br> - l know these people.<br> - You're wasting your time pleading.<br> l'm not pleading.<br> l'm pleading for you...<br> not this scoundrel of a canoe thief.<br> You're a sensitive man.<br> You'll do something to yourself if you<br> govern these somewhat childish people...<br> according to your ideas<br> instead of theirs.<br> You'll destroy yourself.<br> That sounds very ominous.<br> What is that?<br> Father Paul has sighted the Katopua.<br> - He's chattering in his belfry.<br> - Come along, Doctor.<br> You can complain about<br> my tyrannical soul to Madame de Laage.<br> Your wife will like it if you let<br> this miserable canoe-snatcher go.<br> As a homecoming gift!<br> Chief Mehevi, he's sentenced to<br> My dear Doctor...<br> l am ready to give my wife and my<br> friends anything l own in the world...<br> except my sense of honor and duty.<br> A sense of honor in the South Seas<br> is about as useful and often as silly...<br> as a silk hat in a hurricane.<br> Marama!<br> - l think the ship never comes home.<br> - Me, too.<br> l think the wind never blows.<br> l feel like praying...<br> for the wind that overturns the world<br> to hurry the Katopua home.<br> l worry about everything<br> when you're away.<br> About the wind, the waves.<br> Sometimes l worry the fish eat you up.<br> Me? You worry about me?<br> - Why l'm the best sailor in the world!<br> - l know.<br> - l'm the best swimmer, too.<br> - l know.<br> And tonight when we come out of church,<br> l'm the best husband in the world.<br> - l know, l know.<br> - Shut up. You don't know anything yet.<br> Eugene.<br> - Oh, Germaine.<br> - Darling, it seemed forever!<br> All my happiness went with you<br> to France...<br> but it's returned now.<br> O Heavenly Father...<br> we thank Thee for the safe return<br> of our loved ones.<br> Amen.<br> Your health, madame.<br> We certainly missed<br> your civilizing influence.<br> Here's to your homecoming.<br> Your health, Doctor, and Father Paul's<br> and yours, Chief Mehevi.<br> All our people are happy<br> that you come back.<br> Thank you.<br> Tell me, Father Paul...<br> how's my husband been<br> conducting himself in my absence?<br> Like a good governor.<br> - Has he fallen under the tropic's spell?<br> - No, madame!<br> He's been staunchly under the spell<br> of honor and duty.<br> l don't suppose there's any use<br> of my inquiring...<br> whether my uncle answered<br> my application to return to France?<br> No. He said nothing.<br> Farewell, old Cafe de Rostand<br> for another year.<br> l'm sorry.<br> Yes. And in Paris, our good doctor<br> would weep day and night...<br> for his little half-drowned homeland...<br> the island of Manukura.<br> Why, he's as deeply rooted in this place<br> as l am, or Chief Mehevi.<br> My roots are parched, Captain.<br> We'll drink this one to Mehevi.<br> l brought him back the finest<br> bridegroom in the islands.<br> Yes, l know.<br> l see him jump from mast.<br> Who's that?<br> Terangi.<br> l'm delighted to hear the news. l didn't<br> know he was marrying your daughter.<br> You've been too busy<br> with your report cards to France.<br> The romance is known<br> to every child in the islands.<br> l'm delighted.<br> Terangi is utterly charming.<br> He was delightful on the trip.<br> He'd hang from the top of the mast like<br> a bird with wings stretched for home.<br> l hope you'll be able to leave him<br> behind for one voyage, Captain.<br> He's planning on spending<br> his honeymoon in a canoe.<br> lt won't be a long honeymoon.<br> l'd as soon sail without sails<br> as without my first mate.<br> The more l see these natives, the more<br> l think they're more bird than man.<br> Terangi can smell a wind<br> before it's begun to blow.<br> He knows every rock<br> on the sea bottom...<br> and he runs a ship<br> as if it were a pair of shoes.<br> l was saying that very thing<br> to de Laage.<br> l wasted ten good minutes pointing out<br> he's the governor of a flock of birds.<br> Not birds that should be put<br> in a cage...<br> but birds that should be allowed to<br> flutter through the sky which they own.<br> With stolen canoes in their bills,<br> you forgot to mention.<br> When are the nuptials<br> to take place, Father?<br> The wedding will begin at sundown...<br> and will continue until the entire<br> native population is exhausted.<br> Wait a minute.<br> l wanna give a toast.<br> My dear people...<br> l am very happy<br> and l'm a little sad...<br> because when l return to France...<br> any day now...<br> l shall miss your happy faces.<br> But l leave with you<br> my very, very dearest love.<br> And to Terangi...<br> and Marama...<br> Terangi, l had a dream.<br> l had no dream. l slept.<br> Terangi, don't sail away<br> on the ship.<br> Without me,<br> the ship doesn't move.<br> lt stands still<br> in the middle of a wind.<br> Don't sail away.<br> l don't want to,<br> but l smell a wind coming.<br> By noon, the wind will be good.<br> l dreamed that all the birds<br> flew away from Manukura.<br> From Manukura?<br> Where did they fly to?<br> There's no place to go.<br> They flew away.<br> Did you dream there was a wind?<br> No. lt was quiet.<br> Only the sky<br> was full of birds flying away.<br> The dream's no good.<br> Because how could the birds fly away<br> if there is no wind?<br> They only leave<br> when the ifu mantui comes.<br> The wind that overturns the world.<br> The world is gone when you go away.<br> Stay here.<br> You're married a few days and already<br> you're an old wife full of worries.<br> What are you worried about?<br> - About your going away.<br> - l come back!<br> - lf something happens to the boat...<br> - l swim back. Where's my cap?<br> lt's very funny what a difference<br> a cap makes in the world.<br> ln Tahiti, when l wear this cap,<br> everybody is my friend.<br> You think l'm just Terangi who swam<br> with you when you were a little fish.<br> ln Tahiti, when l sit in a cafe with<br> this cap on l'm the same as a white man.<br> Take me with you.<br> No, please.<br> l like to, but l can't.<br> Please! l won't take any room.<br> l'll sleep on top of the mast.<br> You can hang me over the boat's side<br> at night and pull me along with a rope.<br> Only take me.<br> Please, take me.<br> Quiet, quiet.<br> What in blazes are you doin' aboard<br> this boat, Marama?<br> Please, l go to Tahiti.<br> - How did she get aboard? You bring her?<br> - No, l come in a bag like a coconut.<br> What's wrong with going to Tahiti?<br> l never been. l go just once.<br> Listen, the longer you stay aboard,<br> the further you'll have to swim back.<br> You have no reason to go to Tahiti.<br> Oh, yes. l buy a dress<br> with a ribbon on.<br> And red shoes with high heels.<br> And a hat with a feather,<br> and a petticoat with flounces.<br> And a doll that dances.<br> All right. You stay on board.<br> But we'll take Terangi's cap away<br> and he's through being a first mate.<br> l can't have a first mate with a bride.<br> He'll be an ordinary sailor.<br> Scrubbing decks. Gimme that cap.<br> Oh, no, no. Don't take his cap.<br> No, Terangi, he won't.<br> Good-bye.<br> Hurry back.<br> Aloha!<br> l can't give you anything but love<br> Marama!<br> Get up!<br> Get up!<br> Get up, l said!<br> Clear out!<br> Get up when a white man tells ya!<br> Terangi, get back on the ship.<br> My warrant says<br> the man's jaw was broken.<br> l don't care if his jaw was broken!<br> Pity it wasn't his neck.<br> l saw the whole thing,<br> and my mate is not to blame.<br> lf you're his witness, Captain,<br> there won't be any trouble.<br> But he's got to be surrendered.<br> All right. Come on.<br> But l'm going along.<br> l'll see the governor about this.<br> l've spent hours, Governor,<br> trying to find out why my first mate...<br> is sentenced to six months in jail<br> for doing exactly as you or l would do.<br> Your boy hits too hard.<br> Not hard enough. l saw the whole thing.<br> l even testified in court.<br> The sentence is unjust.<br> But surely six months in jail<br> isn't unheard of...<br> in a serious case<br> of assault and battery.<br> Come, Nagle, it isn't a matter<br> of life and death.<br> You don't know the Tuamotu natives.<br> They're not like your Tahitians.<br> They can't stand confinement.<br> There's something behind this. A matter<br> of maintaining European prestige?<br> A native mustn't raise his hand<br> against a white man?<br> Your boy not only hit too hard...<br> but he hit the wrong man.<br> That rum-soaked bully.<br> Strange as it seems,<br> he has influence at home.<br> As soon as he recovered consciousness<br> in the hospital...<br> he cabled the Ministry of Colonies.<br> So Terangi is made<br> a victim of politics.<br> l'm afraid you're right, Nagle.<br> l sail for Manukura in three days.<br> You can't pardon him?<br> Later, perhaps. Not now.<br> l've done all l can.<br> You'll have to take your punishment<br> quietly and cheerfully.<br> You hit too hard, man.<br> That's all.<br> The next time you hit a man,<br> take care not to break his jaw.<br> You're too much of a man<br> to store up any bitterness.<br> Your berth will be waiting on my ship.<br> Time will pass quickly.<br> l'll explain everything to your wife.<br> Will you give her this?<br> Sure, l will.<br> Don't you worry about her.<br> Remember what l've told you.<br> l'll tell you what l'll do.<br> l'll put him on the road gang.<br> Keep him outdoors all day.<br> He's going to take his medicine<br> all right.<br> l hope so.<br> Wasting water, eh, convict?<br> The Katopua.<br> And wouldn't you like<br> to be going home on her!<br> Come on, pick 'em up.<br> Get movin'.<br> Captain Nagle!<br> Chappeli, coffee.<br> Captain Nagle!<br> l wouldn't have had this happen<br> for anything, son.<br> lt just hangs another year<br> on your sentence. That's the penalty.<br> That's what l've got to go by:<br> the law.<br> Lucky you didn't break from the inside.<br> That would've added five years.<br> Now you behave yourself.<br> We don't want to keep you here<br> any longer than we've got to.<br> The long and short of it was,<br> l couldn't do a thing for Terangi.<br> How silly, how unjust.<br> - lt's up to you.<br> - To me?<br> l fail to see in what way.<br> As governor of his island, you can ask<br> to have him paroled in your care.<br> And much as l should like<br> to do just that...<br> l don't think it wise to interfere<br> with the administration of the law.<br> Oh, administration of fiddlesticks!<br> The man's absolutely right.<br> lt isn't a matter of law.<br> lt's political pull and injustice.<br> Just a minute. Let me explain the case<br> a little less legally.<br> De Laage, our friend Terangi<br> isn't just an errand-running islander.<br> He's the best loved of every man, woman<br> and three-year-old child in Manukura.<br> You're not only allowing him to rot<br> in jail, but offending your subjects.<br> And what's worse,<br> you're hurting yourself.<br> Your concern for my soul<br> has flattered me for some time.<br> l must ask you to concern yourself<br> with my more physical ailments.<br> He means well, dear.<br> He's only saying what we all think.<br> l know he means well.<br> l know you all mean well.<br> But l am not the representative<br> of well-meaning points of view.<br> l represent a civilization...<br> that cannot afford to show confusion<br> or conflict to the people it governs.<br> The law has spoken in Tahiti.<br> l must uphold that law.<br> Would it influence<br> your sense of duty at all...<br> to know that Mrs. Terangi<br> is about to be a mother?<br> Really?<br> That's wonderful!<br> That puts everything in a different<br> light. Explain to the authorities.<br> No. lt puts me in a worse light.<br> Now l'm not only Terangi's persecutor,<br> l'm the oppressor of an unborn child.<br> l think it's unfair to appeal<br> to a side of me that's very strong...<br> but that simply cannot<br> function as governor.<br> l understand you, de Laage.<br> Thank you.<br> And my heart feels sad for you.<br> Though six months isn't forever.<br> Terangi's young.<br> Let's make the best of it.<br> So easy to say, Father.<br> But l have to tell her.<br> Yes. He sent her a little gift.<br> Oh, l'll take it to her.<br> There's no need for you<br> to put yourself out, darling.<br> Yes, there is.<br> ln six months, it'll all be over.<br> He'll be back, and you'll both<br> forget so soon.<br> Go away.<br> l want you to come with me and live<br> in my house while you're waiting.<br> There's a lovely garden<br> and you can sit...<br> l don't go to your house.<br> lt'll be easier.<br> l don't want it any easier.<br> Terangi in a jail.<br> You're right.<br> lt won't be long...<br> because no jail can hold Terangi<br> very long.<br> lf it has a window, he'll fly away.<br> lf it has water around it,<br> he'll swim away.<br> And everybody will laugh at the jail<br> that tried to hold Terangi.<br> They'll laugh.<br> lt's another two years, Terangi.<br> Every time you try to break out,<br> it's two more years.<br> Understand? Two more years.<br> That's two more years, Terangi.<br> He cannot possibly escape.<br> - You have jurisdiction over this case!<br> - l don't deny it.<br> You're the only man who can save him<br> from this mad thing that's happening.<br> - He's broken the law.<br> - What law?<br> The law that condemned him<br> unjustly to prison?<br> That refused him the simple rights<br> of a human being?<br> l can't.<br> Eugene, don't be angry<br> at what l'm going to say.<br> l love you. l know your heart.<br> Please stop. My feelings are my own.<br> l won't have them discussed.<br> Sixteen years in a cell with rats<br> for companions! And for what?<br> For thinking himself<br> greater than the law.<br> For breaking jail.<br> For defying authority.<br> Man alive!<br> You can't do it!<br> You know what these people are,<br> and Terangi's the best of them.<br> He'll not live in a cell!<br> He'll die!<br> You're condemning<br> an innocent man to death...<br> out of a cold-blooded whim<br> called honor and duty.<br> Will you listen to Mehevi? Perhaps<br> the chief can think of something.<br> Tell him what you think would be just.<br> Excellency...<br> the people in my island<br> were all happy before.<br> Now they're very unhappy.<br> This is not good law<br> or good justice.<br> You once asked me not to worry<br> about your soul...<br> but to concern myself<br> with more pharmaceutical matters.<br> Well, l'm back on that worry.<br> You're not only condemning poor Terangi,<br> you're condemning yourself.<br> You're condemning yourself to black<br> nights and dreams of ugly remorse...<br> to the betterment of a man who prefers<br> to be a martinet instead of a human.<br> You'll see your guilt as a man<br> written in every face in Manukura.<br> You'll walk as if you were dead among<br> them, without a smile or a greeting...<br> if you lived in these islands<br> for 100 hears.<br> lt'll dry you up!<br> lt'll kill your heart.<br> l am doing my duty.<br> l come of a family that has administered<br> my country's affairs for generations.<br> l understand how strongly<br> your humanitarian feelings run.<br> And yours, Germaine,<br> and yours, Mehevi.<br> Understand mine then.<br> They run as deep.<br> There is no Terangi.<br> There is only a man who has set himself<br> above and beyond the law.<br> lt is not a question of justice<br> or injustice to a human being.<br> lt is a question of upholding the law<br> under which these islands are governed.<br> l am not asking for anyone's smiles<br> as my reward.<br> Take a good look, convict.<br> You haven't got fat Sam to deal with.<br> He wouldn't take my advice<br> and now he's out.<br> And now l'm in.<br> And by all that's holy,<br> you're in.<br> And you're gonna serve every day<br> of your 16 years.<br> And if you ever want<br> that iron off your leg...<br> you're gonna break, see?<br> You're gonna open that ugly mouth<br> of yours and act like a human being!<br> Get that door open!<br> Hurry up!<br> Come on, you blundering fool!<br> Warden.<br> Did you ask the doctor over tonight<br> for chess?<br> Yes. l'm sorry, he was busy.<br> And Father Paul?<br> He had a christening.<br> What's that noise?<br> l don't know.<br> There's no festival<br> this time of year.<br> What are you going to do?<br> Gonna have a walk,<br> take a look around.<br> l'll go with you.<br> Get your wrap.<br> l will.<br> Perhaps it's something nice, a native<br> dance we haven't been told about.<br> Get your wrap.<br> Mehevi!<br> l heard this noise. l came here<br> to find out what it was.<br> The people are celebrating, Excellency.<br> - What are they celebrating?<br> - Their happiness, Excellency.<br> - What has given them happiness?<br> - Terangi.<br> - What about him?<br> - He has escaped, Excellency.<br> When did you hear this?<br> Who brought the news?<br> l have had no official report.<br> The drums have brought the news.<br> The birds have brought it.<br> Do you hear that wind?<br> lt came on the wind.<br> What have you got to say to all this?<br> ls there any law against dancing<br> and singing when the heart's happy?<br> As your governor, l demand<br> what information you have.<br> ls he on this island?<br> Have you seen him?<br> You don't have to see him.<br> He's a legend.<br> You can celebrate him<br> like Bastille Day.<br> He's the soul and symbol<br> of all these good people.<br> No cage can hold 'em.<br> They're the last of the world's<br> afflicted race of humans...<br> who believe in freedom.<br> Look at 'em dance!<br> There's the island's answer<br> to your law.<br> How long have you known of his escape?<br> - The last voyage.<br> - Why wasn't l informed?<br> lt was an official matter.<br> l saw no reason to interfere with the<br> excellent official communication system.<br> Murder!<br> Did you know there was a man<br> murdered by him?<br> He broke the bars that held him<br> in a cage he didn't belong.<br> But murder!<br> l imagine this puts an end<br> to the legend of Terangi.<br> There'll be no more escapes.<br> He'll be caught<br> and sent where he belongs.<br> Sent to the fortress of Cayenne<br> and stowed away in a dungeon...<br> until he's dead and forgotten.<br> Dead and forgotten<br> like any law breaker.<br> Murder and anarchy<br> will leave no legend behind.<br> Father!<br> - What do you see, lad?<br> - There.<br> What is it? A log?<br> No. There's a man hanging on it.<br> Feel better?<br> Yes, Father.<br> And you came from Tahiti<br> in that canoe?<br> Yes.<br> At least 600 miles.<br> Why did you come?<br> l want to go home.<br> They say you killed a man.<br> l don't know.<br> l hit him hard.<br> - Did you mean to kill?<br> - No! Only to go home.<br> You're only a few miles away now.<br> Before you tell, Father,<br> let me go home for one day.<br> l have a daughter.<br> l've never seen her.<br> And Marama.<br> Tell me, Father,<br> has she waited for me?<br> Yes, she's waited.<br> lt's good to be alive...<br> after being drowned.<br> How can l be your judge?<br> You've sinned, but others<br> have sinned more against you.<br> You weren't meant for evil.<br> You were made to do evil.<br> How can l judge?<br> You won't tell, Father?<br> No.<br> We found you in the sea,<br> we shall leave you on land...<br> near to those who love you.<br> No, you owe me no thanks, my son.<br> This is between me...<br> and somebody else.<br> Father, can l tell Marama that Terangi's<br> waiting for her on Motu Tonga?<br> No need to. She's there.<br> Went there yesterday, fishing.<br> To Motu Tonga? He doesn't know it.<br> Why didn't you tell him?<br> What? And spoil their surprise<br> tomorrow morning?<br> You young rascal, l'm ashamed of you.<br> Mama, l saw a man.<br> A strange man.<br> A strange man?<br> Why, Tita,<br> there are no strange men.<br> Marama, l've come back.<br> l've been waiting.<br> Eight years. Long time.<br> You are the same.<br> You?<br> The same.<br> Who is that?<br> She is Tita.<br> Mine?<br> Yes.<br> This is what l dreamed of<br> all the time.<br> l dreamed l'd see you again,<br> and my child.<br> They'll find you and take you away.<br> They can't take this hour away,<br> or this day.<br> They can only take away tomorrow.<br> l heard.<br> l have waited as long as l dared.<br> You must go now.<br> - They know?<br> - The island knows, but not de Laage.<br> Not yet. He will find out.<br> He will hunt you down.<br> De Laage?<br> Why will he hunt me?<br> What have l done against him?<br> His heart is black against you.<br> You must go tonight.<br> - Where, Father?<br> - Fenua lno.<br> Fenua lno.<br> The forbidden place.<br> lt is taboo. No one goes there.<br> No one will look there.<br> You will be safe there until you die.<br> Stay hidden till the darkness.<br> We will load my big canoe.<br> You will start<br> when the island is asleep.<br> Gee, quite a wind coming up.<br> This is the worst l've seen or heard<br> for a long time.<br> Like devils running around.<br> Can you imagine Paris<br> in a wind like this?<br> All the silk hats blowing off,<br> all the bouquets blowing away.<br> All the ashcans bouncing<br> down the avenue.<br> l'm afraid civilization wouldn't look<br> very pretty in a high wind.<br> l've missed you<br> from our dinner table, Doctor.<br> Eugene's been pining for a game of chess<br> for a long time.<br> So have l.<br> You know...<br> Eugene and l<br> have been having a feud.<br> - Cognac, Doctor?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Sort of a battle of souls.<br> Let's check our souls for tonight,<br> de Laage.<br> Let's be Frenchmen,<br> both of us.<br> You're not angry at the doctor,<br> are you?<br> No, l'm not angry at anyone.<br> lt's they who are angry with me,<br> all of them.<br> Black looks and mutterings.<br> Father Paul!<br> Why isn't he here tonight?<br> Praying for my soul, l suppose.<br> They love their precious murderer.<br> Let's forget Terangi,<br> just for tonight.<br> Forget him? He haunts this island<br> like a school of ghosts.<br> l can no longer sense what's going on.<br> l took a walk through the village today.<br> - There's something strange in the air.<br> - Strange?<br> Well, the wind gives the island<br> a different smell.<br> No, not the wind.<br> The natives behaved queerly.<br> Some of them smiled at me.<br> Kept watching me and smiling.<br> l had a feeling something queer<br> was going on behind my back.<br> Something strange. Hidden.<br> lmportant.<br> The only thing important that's<br> happening in the village today...<br> is that Mama Rua is dying.<br> Terangi's mother.<br> Afraid she's gonna die.<br> And Marama's sister's having a baby.<br> l play a kind of chess game...<br> with the oldest gambler<br> in the world: death.<br> He takes Mama Rua...<br> and l checkmate him with a baby.<br> l think l'll have<br> another drop of cognac...<br> just to keep the wind out of my bones<br> on the way home.<br> l've never been on the island<br> in a storm. Do they get bad?<br> l've heard tales of them.<br> Winds that blow the islands<br> out of the sea.<br> But l think Manukura<br> is pretty well anchored.<br> At least part of it.<br> The devil's abroad tonight!<br> We're all on edge tonight.<br> What are you doing, boy?<br> Answer me.<br> What are you up to?<br> What are you doing<br> with the chief's canoe?<br> Stealing?<br> Stubborn, eh?<br> Very well.<br> Come along to Father Paul's house<br> with me.<br> Be careful with the sail.<br> - Excuse me coming at this hour, Father.<br> - You are welcome.<br> - l want your help.<br> - lt's yours, de Laage.<br> - You know this boy?<br> - Yes. Mako. He's a good boy.<br> - He won't lie to you, Father Paul.<br> - Oh, no.<br> Ask him where he was going<br> with that canoe.<br> Whose canoe?<br> A boat loaded with food.<br> Food being smuggled to Terangi.<br> He's on this island.<br> He's being hidden.<br> He's waiting for the boy in that canoe.<br> Father, l didn't tell!<br> l didn't tell!<br> Hear that? He confesses.<br> Captain Nagle smuggled him in.<br> l'd been waiting for that.<br> And you refused to come<br> to my home tonight. Why?<br> Because you know. You were afraid<br> to face me. You're guilty.<br> They're all guilty.<br> The whole island.<br> l'll break Nagle for this.<br> Neither this boy nor Captain Nagle<br> had anything to do with it.<br> Terangi was picked up at sea<br> ten miles from here.<br> By whom?<br> You! When?<br> Last night.<br> You helped Terangi.<br> You, my own priest!<br> - l'm his priest, too.<br> - You helped a murderer.<br> l aided a man<br> whose heart is innocent.<br> You betrayed your own government.<br> You've given aid to anarchy<br> and bloodshed.<br> - l'll answer for it.<br> - You'll answer me, Priest.<br> - Where is he?<br> - l don't know.<br> He knows! You're in the presence<br> of your own priest, boy!<br> You dare not lie.<br> Where is Terangi?<br> Would you ask this child<br> to betray someone he loves?<br> l'm asking him to tell the law<br> what he knows.<br> The government demands information<br> against the murderer.<br> There are stronger things<br> than governments in this world.<br> Something deeper.<br> More real.<br> This child has that in his heart.<br> Though you tortured him,<br> he wouldn't speak.<br> He shall pay for his silence.<br> And l shall bless him for it.<br> - l've never seen the barometer so low.<br> - Did you send my note to Captain Nagle?<br> Yes, he's waiting inside.<br> l'll come to the point at once.<br> l am commandeering your schooner.<br> - This wind is too strong to be out in.<br> - How soon can you be ready to sail?<br> - The weather's bad.<br> - How soon can you be ready to sail?<br> - Nagle's thinking of your safety.<br> - He's trying to frighten you.<br> l'm not trying to frighten anybody.<br> We can't find Terangi in this storm.<br> - lt'll get worse.<br> - lt'll blow itself out in 24 hours.<br> lf l delay, it may be too late.<br> He'll get away.<br> We're in the track of a rising wind.<br> The barometer's falling!<br> - You must listen.<br> - l'll listen to one voice, my own.<br> De Laage, l told you<br> you'll end by destroying yourself.<br> l'm ordering your schooner<br> in the name of the government.<br> Take him along.<br> Go out in this wind, de Laage.<br> Maybe you'll find something<br> more important than Terangi.<br> When you feel the might of the sea<br> and wind, maybe you'll discover...<br> there's something greater in this world<br> than the French criminal code.<br> Terangi's out there.<br> He's paddling through this storm<br> in a canoe.<br> Go chase him. Then hear God howl<br> and laugh at you.<br> - Get your ship ready.<br> - l'll be ready when you are.<br> Oh, Eugene.<br> Look! What is it?<br> The birds. They're flying away,<br> like your dream.<br> - Terangi, where are you going?<br> - Back to Manukura.<br> Look!<br> The great storm is coming,<br> the wind that overturns the land.<br> Go to Tavi's store.<br> Get ropes. Anchor your houses.<br> Take to the trees<br> if the sea should cover the land.<br> - Go quickly!<br> - Go!<br> - What's that?<br> - Either the wind or end of the world.<br> And me with a baby to deliver.<br> - Take her to the church.<br> - No. Surf boat! Surf boat better.<br> Surf boats?<br> Are you crazy?<br> Sea will cover land.<br> Surf boat better!<br> All right, take her to the surf boats.<br> Surf boats!<br> And l commit suicide.<br> - You'll need me to help you.<br> - Everyone go to the church.<br> No! Sea rising.<br> Carry church away.<br> No, the church is on high ground.<br> Come with me.<br> No, come to the boat!<br> Come on.<br> The reef!<br> lt's breaking.<br> Come on!<br> Come on!<br> Father, will the sea rise<br> and cover the island?<br> We're on the highest spot here,<br> my daughter.<br> Even if the sea reaches us,<br> the walls will keep it out.<br> The church! lt's going!<br> Father Paul, come. The sea is breaking<br> in. The walls are going. Look!<br> Take those who want to go.<br> l am staying here.<br> You will drown.<br> You saved me. Take my arm<br> and let me save you.<br> - No, my son. Take madame.<br> - No, l'll stay here with you.<br> Take her back safe to the world<br> that has wronged you.<br> Please, madame, go.<br> Terangi, take her.<br> Yes, Father.<br> Those of you who wish to go, go now.<br> Those who wish to sing with me<br> for the last time, stay.<br> Where is the child?<br> There.<br> ls it boy or girl?<br> You don't know! You haven't got it!<br> lt's dead!<br> No, my daughter. lt's here, alive.<br> lt's a boy!<br> How many survivors, Doctor?<br> ls that all?<br> Germaine, my wife?<br> l wish it could've been me<br> instead of her.<br> l gave you up as well.<br> How did you pull through?<br> We were at the edge of the hurricane.<br> You were at the center.<br> What is it, Terangi?<br> A canoe.<br> A war canoe.<br> Then Father Paul took your wife to<br> the church. lt seemed the safest place.<br> l'd have gone too,<br> except l couldn't desert my patient.<br> That's the last you saw of her?<br> lt grew so dark, you couldn't see<br> the church from the reef boat.<br> But when that bell stopped ringing,<br> l knew what happened.<br> As soon as you can get your<br> engine running, we'll make a search...<br> for survivors.<br> l must make a report, list all dead.<br> l shall want all details.<br> Come with me to the ship.<br> The ship will find us.<br> l know that.<br> The ship will come,<br> and then they'll take Terangi.<br> Oh, no, Marama, no.<br> But l know they will.<br> Terangi knows it.<br> But l'll make them take Tita<br> and me, too.<br> Be quiet, Marama.<br> lt doesn't matter now.<br> We're lucky to be alive.<br> Katopua.<br> - Good-bye, Marama.<br> - Good-bye, madame.<br> Good-bye, little Tita.<br> God bless you, Terangi.<br> Captain!<br> Easy left!<br> Germaine.<br> My dear. My dear.<br> l thought l lost you,<br> but l never gave up hope.<br> Germaine, forgive me.<br> Forgive you?<br> For what?<br> For everything l failed to be<br> since we were married.<br> l faced it all today.<br> l've nearly gone mad.<br> Take me back to the boat now.<br> l'm so dreadfully tired.<br> l know, dear.<br> - Where are the others?<br> - There are no others. Not a soul.<br> l was tied to a tree and drifted here<br> alone. All the others were lost.<br> Let's go back to the boat.<br> Eugene, take me back to the boat!<br> There's something out there.<br> lt's only a floating log.<br> You're right, Germaine.<br> lt's only a floating log.<br> Captions, lnc.
