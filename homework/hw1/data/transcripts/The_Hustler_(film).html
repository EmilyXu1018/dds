I'm not drunk, I'm lame.<br> Why me?<br> Please! You're too hungry.<br> Take it. It's yours.<br> The room is $1.50 a night,<br> or $7 by the week.<br> - By the night.<br> - In advance.<br> A bottle of beer.<br> Hey, mister, is it okay if I grab a cue?<br> - You're Eddie Felson!<br> - Who is he?<br> I saw you play at Ames the other night.<br> I'll play you a game<br> and keep one hand in my pocket.<br> Man, you're way out of our league.<br> - What are you stuck for?<br> - A three. That's enough for me.<br> Thanks.<br> Can I buy you fellows a drink?<br> You know, you shoot good,<br> but you also shoot lucky.<br> Yeah, I shoot lucky.<br> - Why did you do that?<br> - I wanted to see what kind of day it is.<br> A day like any other.<br> - People come. People go.<br> - Give me a drag.<br> - What time is it?<br> - 11:00.<br> I'll be back later.<br> Why?<br> Come here.<br> You need a shave.<br> You mustn't go looking like that.<br> There's a razor and shaving cream in<br> the bathroom, compliments of the house.<br> Why did you say that, Sarah?<br> - How do you know my name was Sarah?<br> - You told me.<br> I lie. When I'm drunk I lie.<br> So what's your name today?<br> It's Sarah.<br> Eddie...<br> ...l've got troubles<br> and I think maybe you've got troubles.<br> Maybe we should leave each other alone.<br> My things are at the hotel.<br> I'll bring them over later.<br> I'm not sure.<br> I don't know.<br> What do you want to know, and why?<br> Thank you.<br> - Where have you been all day?<br> - At school. It's Thursday.<br> Oh, I forgot.<br> You were asleep when I left.<br> I didn't want to wake you.<br> Did you go out?<br> I went out for a couple of hours.<br> A present.<br> You know,<br> I've been living here for almost three years.<br> Now, in three days,<br> it seems like I know everybody.<br> When I pass people on the street...<br> ...I want to stop them and say,<br> "Listen, I've got a fellow!"<br> Thanks.<br> Eddie, where do you go when you go out?<br> Museums, art galleries, concerts.<br> I believe you<br> when you say you go to school.<br> - Do you want to go with me?<br> - Are you kidding?<br> See that book?<br> I began it when I first got here,<br> I haven't finished the first chapter.<br> Did you read all those books?<br> Got it all in your head?<br> When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up<br> when I'm drunk. Usually they're mixed up.<br> Stop talking about yourself<br> like you're a lush. I don't like it.<br> You should go to a clinic,<br> and get some treatment.<br> I'm getting treatment right here.<br> I'm hungry.<br> Take your choice.<br> I got enough so we won't have to leave<br> the house till Tuesday.<br> What did all this stuff cost you?<br> - When you got money, you'll pay.<br> - I want to know, to keep the score.<br> The bills are right here.<br> You didn't say what you wanted.<br> - Don't you ever cook anything?<br> - Eggs. How do you like them?<br> Raw.<br> I cut my finger.<br> - I got something in my bag.<br> - It's not bad.<br> Eddie, what's in that case?<br> - Haven't you opened it?<br> - No. Why should I? It's yours.<br> It's a machine gun.<br> A guy told me, in the big city<br> I'd need a machine gun. So I bought one.<br> Where did you get the money<br> to pay for all this?<br> I mean liquor and the groceries<br> and the rent.<br> From a rich old man<br> who used to be my lover.<br> Hello, Eddie.<br> Hello, Charlie.<br> Come on in.<br> - That's my girl.<br> - Hello, Eddie's girl.<br> I looked all over for you.<br> - How did you find me?<br> - I asked around.<br> - Do you want me to go?<br> - No. Stick around.<br> - Can we get you a drink?<br> - I don't want to be no bother.<br> Don't play it small.<br> It don't look good on you.<br> - How do you want me to play? I'm broke.<br> - So am I.<br> Sit down.<br> Would you get us a couple of drinks?<br> You walked out on me. No goodbye,<br> no nothing. Like a thief in the dark.<br> We were partners, more than partners.<br> He was like a...<br> - A son.<br> - Yes, like a son.<br> I've known him since he was 16.<br> The first time I saw him in Oakland, I said:<br> "This is a talented boy.<br> This is a smart boy."<br> Talk to me.<br> I want you to come back<br> on the road with me.<br> I have no stomach<br> for that kind of life anymore.<br> What is your life like here? Playing the<br> small rooms, winning a few bucks a day.<br> I'll connect. I'll get your money back.<br> Do you intend to play Fats again at Ames?<br> Is that what's on your mind?<br> Never been out of it.<br> I'm going to beat that fat man...<br> ...with that curly hair and<br> those diamond rings and that carnation.<br> This boy is crazy! They wiped the floor<br> with him and he wants to go back.<br> - What for? Another beating?<br> - You'll get your money back!<br> He thinks I care about the money.<br> I care about you.<br> Do you care about me, Eddie?<br> We were together a long time,<br> night and day.<br> So how do you say goodbye?<br> You give me the car and $100.<br> Do you think I care about the dough<br> or the car? I care about you.<br> This boy is the greatest pool hustler<br> you ever saw.<br> A high-class con man.<br> He can charm anybody into anything.<br> Did he tell you how well we did<br> on the road? We had everything.<br> We ate well, we slept late...<br> ...we had money to burn.<br> Whiskey, dames... Excuse me.<br> I tell you what, take her along.<br> And if you don't want to start right away,<br> we won't start right away.<br> We'll drive to Miami.<br> Get it all out of your system.<br> Have a few laughs, a few weeks in the sun.<br> - With what?<br> - Don't worry, I'll raise the money.<br> - Yeah? Where?<br> - What's the difference? I'll raise it.<br> Could I have another drink?<br> Did you hold out on me, Charlie?<br> How much?<br> How much?<br> My 25%. Approximately $1,500.<br> You crumb! With that much<br> I could have beat him! That's all I needed.<br> Give me the money!<br> - What for, to play Fats again?<br> - Yes, I'll play Fats again!<br> If you want to come back on the road,<br> the money is yours...<br> ...but not if you want to give it to Fats.<br> What do you say?<br> You still don't see, do you, Charlie?<br> You're nothing but a small-time Charlie.<br> You would love to keep me hustling,<br> wouldn't you?<br> In a couple more years,<br> with me playing in those little towns...<br> ...you might be able to buy a poolroom<br> in Oakland...<br> ...six tables and a handbook on the side.<br> Is that when you say goodbye to me?<br> - Is that what you think?<br> - Yeah. That's what I think.<br> All right, that's what I want...<br> ...a poolroom and a little handbook<br> on the side.<br> I'm getting old.<br> Lay down and die by yourself.<br> Don't take me with you.<br> - Just like that.<br> - Yes, just like that!<br> Thanks for the drink, Eddie's girl.<br> Give me another drink.<br> Boy.<br> Everybody wants a piece of me!<br> Won't you have one?<br> What did he have to come back here for,<br> anyway?<br> Come here.<br> Come here.<br> - Are you going out?<br> - For a little while.<br> Are you okay?<br> What are you writing?<br> It's a story. A story I'm making up.<br> Give it to me.<br> What is this supposed to mean?<br> Give it back to me!<br> What does this mean?<br> "We have a contract of depravity.<br> All we have to do is draw the blinds."<br> Write yourself another story!<br> Well, what else have we got?<br> We never talk about anything.<br> We stay here in this room<br> and we drink and we make love.<br> We're strangers!<br> What happens when the liquor<br> and money run out, Eddie?<br> You told Charlie to lay down and die.<br> Will you say that to me, too?<br> What happens, Eddie?<br> - You find another rich old lover.<br> - That's right. And I'm sure you'll help me!<br> Are you waiting for me to cry?<br> You bum!<br> You poolroom bum!<br> - Give me a bottle of beer.<br> - Right.<br> - How did you make out?<br> - I made a few bucks.<br> - Poker game?<br> - Yeah.<br> Is it open?<br> It's open.<br> - What will you have?<br> - Give me a beer.<br> - Okay?<br> - Sit down.<br> - What's the limit?<br> - Half and a dollar.<br> - Give me $10 worth of chips.<br> - $10.<br> - Make it $20.<br> - $20.<br> Cut.<br> Deal.<br> - Bourbon. J.T.S. Brown.<br> - Two.<br> I'm buying.<br> I thought you only drank milk.<br> - Only when I work.<br> - Yeah? Why?<br> I like it. It's good for you.<br> If you're gambling, whiskey gives you<br> an excuse for losing. You don't need that.<br> - How did you make out in the poker game?<br> - I lost $20.<br> Poker's not your game.<br> - What is?<br> - Pool.<br> Are you being cute?<br> No pool player shoots better pool<br> than you shot the other night at Ames.<br> - You have talent.<br> - So I have talent. So what beat me?<br> - Character.<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> You're damn right, I'm sure.<br> Everybody has talent. I have talent.<br> You think you can play big-money pool<br> or poker for 40 hours with only talent?<br> Is Fats the best in the country<br> just because he has talent? No.<br> He has more character in one finger<br> than you have in your body.<br> - I got drunk.<br> - He drank as much whiskey as you did.<br> - He knows how to drink.<br> - You bet he knows how.<br> You think that's a talent, too?<br> You think Fats was born<br> knowing how to drink?<br> Okay, what do I do now?<br> Lie down and bow from the ankles?<br> - What do I do, go home?<br> - That's your problem.<br> Or do I stay?<br> Stay until I hustle up<br> enough to play Fats again.<br> Maybe, by that time,<br> I'll have developed some character.<br> Maybe, by that time, you'll die of old age.<br> - How much will you need?<br> - $1,000.<br> At least $3,000.<br> He'll start at $500 a game,<br> and he'll beat the pants off you.<br> That's the way he plays against a man<br> who knows the way the game is.<br> He'll beat you five times or more,<br> depending on your nerves.<br> He might be scared of you. That could<br> change things, but don't count on it.<br> How do you know<br> when nobody knows that much?<br> Did you see that big car parked outside?<br> Well, that's mine. I like that car.<br> I get a new one every year, because I know<br> what guys like you and him will do.<br> I made enough off you the other night<br> to pay for it twice over.<br> In that case, you owe me another drink.<br> Eddie?<br> - May I get personal?<br> - What have you been so far?<br> Eddie, you're a born loser.<br> What's that supposed to mean?<br> It was the first time<br> I'd ever seen Fats hooked, really hooked.<br> - But you let him off.<br> - I got drunk.<br> Sure you did.<br> You have the best excuse for losing.<br> No trouble losing<br> when you have a good excuse.<br> But winning, that can be heavy<br> on your back, too, like a monkey.<br> You can drop that load with an excuse.<br> You have to learn to feel sorry for yourself.<br> It's one of the best indoor sports, feeling<br> sorry for yourself, and enjoyed by all.<br> - Especially the born losers.<br> - Thanks for the drink.<br> - Wait. Maybe I can help you.<br> - To do what?<br> - Get the $3,000, play Fats again.<br> - Why?<br> Ten reasons, maybe fifteen.<br> Also there's something in it for me.<br> - I figured that. How much?<br> - 75%.<br> - For who?<br> - For me.<br> That's a big slice.<br> Who do you think you are, General Motors?<br> How much do you think<br> you are worth these days?<br> I'm supplying the money and time,<br> for that I get 75% return, if you win.<br> - You think I can lose?<br> - That's all I've seen.<br> - You saw me win $18,000.<br> - You want to hustle pool, don't you?<br> The game isn't like football.<br> Nobody pays you for yardage.<br> When you hustle,<br> you keep score real simple.<br> At the end of the game, you count<br> your money to find out who is best.<br> Why back me, then?<br> Back yourself, play poker and get rich.<br> I am already rich, but I like action.<br> That's one thing you're good for, action.<br> Besides, like I say, you've got talent.<br> You already told me that.<br> You cut that slice down to bite-size,<br> and maybe we can talk.<br> We don't talk. I don't make bad bets.<br> It is 75%-25%.<br> - Kiss off.<br> - Wait.<br> - What'll you do about the money?<br> - There are places. I'll scuffle around.<br> The word's out on you, Eddie.<br> In the wrong place, they'll eat you alive.<br> When did you adopt me?<br> I don't know when it was.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> You lucky punk. I quit you!<br> Do you want in, friend?<br> - How much are you playing for?<br> - $1 on the five. $2 on the nine.<br> - I'll play a couple of games, just for kicks.<br> - Okay, friend.<br> That's it for me.<br> That does it for me, too.<br> - Are you quitting, too?<br> - You're a pretty good player.<br> - How much are you ahead?<br> - A couple of bucks.<br> - It's just you and me.<br> - I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.<br> Do you want to raise the bet?<br> $2 on the five. $5 on the nine.<br> You know, kid,<br> I think maybe you're a hustler.<br> - Try me.<br> - Shoot.<br> Okay.<br> You sure you don't want to quit, friend?<br> Let's cut out the small stuff.<br> $100 freeze-out.<br> Ten games at $10 a game,<br> the winner takes all.<br> Then we'll see who quits.<br> Okay, friend, you're on.<br> - Call it.<br> - Heads.<br> You win.<br> You better not miss, friend.<br> I don't rattle, kid.<br> But just for that, I'm going to beat you flat!<br> That's one.<br> That's five.<br> That's six.<br> That's ten.<br> You two-bit punk, come on. Pay up, $100!<br> - You quitting, friend?<br> - Yes, I'm quitting.<br> Why, you're a pool shark, boy.<br> A real pool shark.<br> - So is he.<br> - You're better than he was. Much better.<br> There's your money, boy.<br> There's your money, boy.<br> Pool shark!<br> Wait a minute.<br> Let's give this boy his money.<br> We always pay what we lose, boy.<br> We've got no use for pool sharks<br> around here!<br> - Who is it?<br> - It's me, Eddie.<br> What happened?<br> I got beat up.<br> They broke my thumbs.<br> God!<br> Sarah, they broke my thumbs.<br> Broke my thumbs.<br> It's all right.<br> I'm here.<br> You can read it if you want to.<br> Do you want to go out for a while?<br> To a movie?<br> - Do you want a drink?<br> - No, do you?<br> What's it so hot in here for?<br> Please!<br> - Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?<br> - A loser?<br> Yeah.<br> I met this guy, Bert Gordon.<br> He said I was a born loser.<br> - Would he know?<br> - He knows a lot.<br> - Why did he tell you?<br> - I'm not sure.<br> He says there are people<br> who always look for an excuse to lose.<br> - What does this Bert Gordon do?<br> - He's a gambler.<br> - Is he a winner?<br> - He owns things.<br> - Is that what makes a winner?<br> - What else does?<br> - Does it bother you, what he said?<br> - Yeah.<br> It bothers me a lot.<br> Because, you see, twice,<br> once at Ames with Fats...<br> ...and then again at Arthur's...<br> That cheap, crummy poolroom.<br> Why did I do it, Sarah?<br> I could have beat that guy cold.<br> He never would've known.<br> I just had to show him.<br> I had to show those punks<br> how great the game can be when it's great.<br> You know, anything can be great, anything.<br> Bricklaying can be great if a guy knows.<br> If he knows what he's doing and why,<br> and if he can make it come off.<br> Why, when I'm really going, I feel like a...<br> Like a jockey must feel sitting on his horse,<br> with all that speed and power underneath.<br> He's coming into the stretch,<br> the pressure's on and he knows.<br> He just feels when to let it go,<br> and how much.<br> He's got everything working for him.<br> Timing, touch.<br> It's a great feeling.<br> A real great feeling,<br> when you're right and you know it.<br> Suddenly, there's oil in my arm.<br> The pool cue is part of me.<br> The pool cue has nerves in it.<br> It's a piece of wood with nerves.<br> Feel the roll of those balls.<br> You don't have to look, you just know.<br> You make shots<br> that nobody's ever made before.<br> And you play that game<br> the way nobody's ever played it before.<br> You're not a loser, you're a winner.<br> Some men never feel that way<br> about anything.<br> I love you, Eddie.<br> Some day, Sarah, you'll settle down.<br> You'll marry a college professor.<br> You'll write a great book, maybe about me.<br> "Fast Eddie Felson, Hustler."<br> I love you.<br> Do you need the words?<br> Yes, I need them very much.<br> If you ever say them,<br> I'll never let you take them back.<br> You glad?<br> Yes, I'm glad.<br> Hello, Eddie.<br> Hi.<br> - How's business?<br> - Slow.<br> - Something wrong with your hand?<br> - I had an accident. A place called Arthur's.<br> You seem to do all right that way.<br> My game is about 20% off, maybe more.<br> - Did somebody step on your hand?<br> - A big creep broke my thumbs.<br> A man named Turk?<br> You know everybody, don't you?<br> Everybody who can hurt me or help me.<br> It pays.<br> - You should give me lessons.<br> - Sign up.<br> Where do I sign?<br> The first match I have in mind<br> is in Louisville, Kentucky.<br> Name the place, boss, I'll be there.<br> - What happened?<br> - Like I told you, my thumbs.<br> I don't mean the thumbs.<br> You already told me.<br> - I've been thinking.<br> - Thinking about what?<br> Maybe I'm not such a great piece<br> of property right now.<br> A 25% slice of something big<br> is better than a 100% slice of nothing.<br> Give us a couple of drinks.<br> J.T.S. Brown.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - 'Evening.<br> - Give us a nice quiet table.<br> - Yes, sir, right this way.<br> Would you like a drink before dinner?<br> Okay?<br> Sherry, very old, very dry.<br> Two.<br> Sherry?<br> - It's a nice joint. You look very pretty.<br> - I feel pretty.<br> - What's so funny?<br> - Your tie.<br> I've never seen you wear one before.<br> There's a first time for everything.<br> Yeah, that's great.<br> Excuse me.<br> To you, Eddie.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> What is it, Eddie?<br> Want another drink?<br> What do you want to tell me?<br> I'll be leaving town for a little while.<br> For how long?<br> - I don't know.<br> - A week, a year?<br> - More like a week. I'll be back.<br> - Sure.<br> Let's go home.<br> Taxi!<br> - No, I'll walk.<br> - Come here.<br> Better get some dry things on.<br> - Don't you want to know where I'm going?<br> - No.<br> Yes, I want to know what for,<br> but I don't want to ask.<br> I'm going to Kentucky,<br> to Louisville with a friend.<br> I'm going to try to make some money.<br> I need it.<br> I'll leave early in the morning.<br> - Leave now.<br> - Grow up.<br> Why should I?<br> I'm going there to play pool<br> with a guy named Findley.<br> I need the action and I need the money.<br> I told you I'd be back.<br> If you were returning, you wouldn't<br> have taken me out or bought this dress.<br> You're hustling me.<br> You've never stopped hustling me.<br> No, I've never hustled you,<br> even when I thought I was, you know it.<br> Do you want me to sit and wait?<br> Faithful little Sarah.<br> Pull the shades down and sit.<br> When you feel like coming back,<br> you'll come back and love me.<br> And then you'll go away again.<br> Is that your idea of love?<br> I've got no idea of love.<br> Neither one of us would know what it was<br> if we saw it coming down the street.<br> I'd know it.<br> I'd know it.<br> For God's sake, what are you doing to me?<br> I love you.<br> What's your idea of love, chains?<br> No.<br> I made you up, didn't I, Eddie?<br> You weren't real.<br> I made you up like everything else.<br> There was no car crash, Eddie.<br> When I was five I had polio.<br> I was never an actress.<br> The rich old man is my father.<br> He walked out on us when I was seven.<br> He sends a check every month<br> to buy his way out of my life.<br> The men I've known...<br> ...after they'd left, I'd say,<br> "They weren't real, I made them up."<br> But you, Eddie, I wanted you to be real.<br> I'm so scared!<br> I'm scared.<br> - Sarah Packard, Bert Gordon.<br> - How do you do?<br> That one of mine goes in Drawing Room A.<br> Thank you.<br> I got it.<br> - You sure you'll be comfortable, Miss...<br> - Packard. Sarah Packard.<br> It takes me a while to memorize a name.<br> - Are you sure you don't want anything?<br> - No, I'm fine.<br> You ever been to Louisville for Derby week,<br> Miss Packard?<br> - I've never been to Louisville.<br> - Lots of action, lots of money, lots of class.<br> You see the best dressed,<br> most beautiful women in the world.<br> Knock your eyes out.<br> Findley is rich. His grandfather<br> left him 20% of a tobacco company.<br> What, and he hustles, too?<br> He's a gentleman, a gentleman gambler<br> who gets his kicks playing with hustlers.<br> He's got an old southern mansion,<br> with a pool table.<br> He drinks eight-year-old bourbon,<br> smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.<br> - How good is he?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I never saw him play. I hear he's great.<br> - I'm ready.<br> As soon as I've finished my coffee.<br> - You have great confidence in me.<br> - I don't.<br> - I've confidence in Findley.<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> It means I'm confident he's a loser.<br> All the way a loser.<br> You are only about one half loser,<br> the other half winner.<br> - I'm finished.<br> - I got it.<br> No. When you play for me,<br> I pick up all the tabs.<br> Fats knew the game was in the clutch,<br> so he had to do something to stop you.<br> - He played it smart.<br> - I've played that game in my head, too.<br> Play it again. Learn something.<br> Fats went to the john.<br> He washed his face, cleaned his fingernails,<br> made his mind a blank...<br> ...combed his hair,<br> and came back all ready to go.<br> You were through.<br> You saw how he looked,<br> clean, ready to start all over again.<br> Hold tight and push hard.<br> Do you know what you were doing?<br> You were waiting to get beat.<br> You were flattened out on your butt,<br> swimming in glory and whiskey...<br> ...probably deciding how you could lose.<br> What makes you know so much?<br> How do you know what he was thinking?<br> I know.<br> Been there myself.<br> We've all been there, haven't we,<br> Miss Packard?<br> Got a match?<br> Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?<br> I forgot all about it.<br> - How is your hand?<br> - Fine.<br> Good. I'd hate to put my money<br> on a cripple.<br> - Why did you say a thing like that?<br> - I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense.<br> It was a figure of speech.<br> - That's right, Miss Packard.<br> - A fact is a fact.<br> She's a smart girl, Eddie.<br> Right this way, Mr. Gordon.<br> Here you are, Mr. Gordon, Suite 56.<br> I wired ahead for two suites adjoining.<br> - I don't recall.<br> - I do! I want two suites.<br> I'm sorry, we're filled up,<br> this is Derby week.<br> You're wrong, you must've gotten my wire.<br> - Look through your reservations.<br> - I'll see what I can do.<br> Yes, you're right, Mr. Gordon.<br> I mislaid your wire. Two adjoining suites?<br> That's sweet music in there. You can<br> almost smell the action and the money.<br> I can feel it right down<br> in the bottom of my shoes.<br> - Eddie!<br> - Billy, how are you?<br> I didn't know you were here. Everyone's<br> here. It's like a hustlers' convention!<br> West Stone Kid, Johnny Jumbo.<br> Come in, the guys will be glad to see you.<br> - What room are we in?<br> - 57.<br> I'll be up later.<br> Wait, Miss Packard.<br> We're neighbors, now. Call me Sarah.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> Do we need words?<br> I think so. We could cut each other up,<br> but that'd be bad for everybody...<br> ...for me, for you,<br> and worst of all for Eddie.<br> You know what's good for him.<br> To win.<br> For whom and for what?<br> What makes the world go around?<br> For money and for glory.<br> Answer my first question. For whom?<br> Today for me, tomorrow for himself.<br> There is no tomorrow with you.<br> You own all the tomorrows,<br> because you buy them today, cheap.<br> Nobody has to sell.<br> - You bastard...<br> - Miss Ladybird!<br> You are here on a rain check, and I know it.<br> Hanging on by your nails.<br> You let that glory whistle blow for Eddie...<br> ...and you're a wreck on the track,<br> a horse that finished last.<br> Don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird.<br> Live and let live!<br> While you can.<br> I'll make it up to you.<br> How?<br> You tell me.<br> Thanks.<br> There are three late scratches<br> in the following race:<br> Rosemary, Stroke of Luck, and L & R.<br> - Where's Bert?<br> - He went off somewhere.<br> That old loving horse paid $22.40!<br> With the $200 I won from that jockey<br> last night, and today at the track, I've $540.<br> - Here, you hold it.<br> - Why?<br> Just for luck.<br> - Findley's here.<br> - Where?<br> Over there by the bar.<br> - Aren't you going to talk to him?<br> - Sit tight. He'll be over here.<br> - You ready for another?<br> - Thank you.<br> No more for me.<br> Hello. I haven't seen you in a long time.<br> I haven't been here for a long time.<br> Miss Packard, Eddie Felson. James...<br> Findley.<br> - Glad to meet you.<br> - And I, you.<br> I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson.<br> You play pocket billiards, don't you?<br> - Now and then. Why? Do you?<br> - A little, but I'm afraid I generally lose.<br> So does Eddie.<br> - I win sometimes.<br> - I bet you do, Mr. Felson. I just bet you do.<br> How much?<br> Bert?<br> I believe Mr. Felson<br> is making a proposition.<br> Could be.<br> Well, Mr. Felson...<br> ...maybe you'd like to come to my place<br> sometime. We can play billiards.<br> When?<br> - You're very direct.<br> - That's right. When?<br> - Tonight?<br> - What time?<br> I'm having some people for drinks<br> right after the races.<br> Why don't you all come?<br> Then about 10:00 we can play.<br> - We'll be there.<br> - Good.<br> If you don't mind,<br> I think I will stay at the hotel.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I'm tired.<br> Come on, it'll be a lot of laughs.<br> Findley's parties are famous.<br> He invites everybody from high society<br> to every tramp in town.<br> Another way he gets his kicks.<br> It excites him to be around<br> the criminal type.
