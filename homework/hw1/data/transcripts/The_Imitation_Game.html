What of?<br> Well, that's just it.<br> Nothing missing, really.<br> What's he doing in Manchester?<br> Something with machines.<br> The project at the NPL.<br> I checked, but he won't<br> say what it's on.<br> Professor Turing?<br> Detective Nock,<br> Manchester Police.<br> Sergeant Staehl here tells me<br> you had a burglary last night.<br> Professor Turing?<br> Take a step back,<br> and don't breath heavily.<br> -Breathe?<br> -Undiluted cyanide.<br> It-it wouldn't take<br> more than a thimbleful<br> to kill you.<br> Ah.<br> Disappointing.<br> Pardon?<br> I-I had hoped for a bit more.<br> Sergeant Staehl, is it just me,<br> or do you get the sense<br> that we're being insulted?<br> Last night, you had a break-in.<br> Your neighbor, Mr. Springborn,<br> called to report the noise.<br> He said there was<br> quite a ruckus.<br> Only you say nothing was taken.<br> It's odd.<br> So how about you tell us<br> what happened, and we'll find<br> the chap who did this.<br> Gentlemen,<br> I-I don't believe<br> that you could find the chap<br> that did this<br> if, uh, he walked up to you<br> and spat in your face.<br> Uh, what I could us right now<br> is not a bobby,<br> but a really good cleaning lady.<br> So unless one of you<br> has a-an apron<br> in your car, I suggest<br> you file your reports<br> and leave me alone.<br> As you say, Professor Turing.<br> Best of luck with your cyanide.<br> I'll give you a quid<br> if you can name me<br> a more insufferable sod.<br> Seemed a bit forced,<br> though, didn't it?<br> Don't know what you mean.<br> Well, if you didn't want<br> a pair of bobbies<br> digging around in your<br> personal affairs,<br> that'd have been a stellar way<br> to make sure they don't.<br> Tell me you don't think<br> this is suspicious.<br> I don't think<br> this is suspicious.<br> A mysterious professor<br> who won't admit<br> he's had something stolen<br> from his house?<br> I think Alan Turing's<br> hiding something.<br> (steam train whistle squeals)<br> War declared!<br> German bombs on their way!<br> Get your papers here!<br> Fresh off the press!<br> War declared!<br> German bombs expected soon!<br> This morning,<br> the British Ambassador<br> in Berlin<br> handed the German government<br> a final note stating that<br> unless we heard from them,<br> by 11:00,<br> a state of war<br> would exist between us.<br> I have to tell you now<br> that no such undertaking<br> has been received.<br> And that, consequently,<br> this country is at war<br> with Germany.<br> (indistinct children playing)<br> KING GEORGE VI:<br> For the second time<br> in the lives of most of us,<br> we are...<br> at war.<br> ...to find<br> a peaceful way out...<br> Papers, please.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Oh, uh,<br> the lady told me to wait.<br> In my office?<br> She tell you to help<br> yourself to tea<br> while you were here?<br> Uh, no, she didn't.<br> She obviously didn't tell you<br> what a joke was, then,<br> either, I gather.<br> Was she supposed to?<br> Who are you?<br> Alan Turing.<br> Ah, Turing.<br> The mathematician.<br> Correct.<br> -However could I have guessed?<br> -Well, you didn't.<br> You just read it on<br> that piece of paper.<br> King's College, Cambridge.<br> Now, it says here you were<br> a bit of a prodigy<br> in the maths department.<br> I-I'm not sure I can<br> evaluate that, Mr....<br> -How old are you, Mr. Turing?<br> -Uh, 27.<br> And how old were you when you<br> became a Fellow at Cambridge?<br> -24.<br> -And how old were you<br> when you published<br> this paper that has a title<br> I can barely understand?<br> -Uh, 23.<br> -And you don't think<br> that qualifies you<br> as a certified prodigy?<br> Well, Newton discovered<br> binomial theorem aged 22.<br> Einstein wrote four papers<br> that changed the world<br> by the age of 26.<br> As far as I can tell,<br> I've... (chuckles)<br> I've barely made par.<br> My God, you're serious.<br> Would you prefer I made a joke?<br> Oh, I don't think you know<br> what those are.<br> Hardly seems fair that<br> that's a requirement<br> for employment here, Mr....<br> Commander Denniston,<br> Royal Navy.<br> All right,<br> Mr. Turing, I'll bite.<br> Why do you wish to work<br> for His Majesty's government?<br> Oh, I don't, really.<br> Are you a bleeding pacifist?<br> I'm... agnostic about violence.<br> Well, you do realize<br> that 600 miles away from London<br> there's this nasty little chap<br> called Hitler<br> who wants to engulf Europe<br> in tyranny?<br> Politics isn't really<br> my area of expertise.<br> Really?<br> Well, I believe<br> you've just set the record<br> for the shortest job interview<br> in British military history.<br> Oh, uh...<br> Mother says I can be off-putting<br> sometimes on account<br> of being one of the best<br> mathematicians in the world.<br> In the world?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Do you know how many people<br> I've rejected for this program?<br> -No.<br> -Well, that's right,<br> because we're<br> a top-secret program.<br> But I'll tell you,<br> just because we're friends,<br> that only last week,<br> I rejected one of our<br> great nation's top linguists.<br> Knows German better<br> than Bertolt Brecht.<br> I don't speak German.<br> What?<br> I don't...<br> speak German.<br> Well, how the hell<br> were you supposed to decrypt<br> German communications<br> if you don't...<br> I don't know, speak German?<br> Well, I'm really quite excellent<br> at crossword puzzles.<br> -Margaret!<br> -The German codes are a puzzle.<br> A game, just like<br> any other game.<br> -Margaret, where are you?<br> -I'm really very good at games.<br> Uh, puzzles.<br> And this is the most difficult<br> puzzle in the world.<br> Margaret!<br> For the love of God.<br> This is a joke, obviously.<br> I'm afraid I don't know<br> what those are,<br> Commander Denniston.<br> Have a pleasant trip<br> back to Cambridge, Professor.<br> Enigma.<br> You called for me?<br> That's what you're doing here.<br> The top-secret program<br> at Bletchley.<br> You're trying to break<br> the German Enigma machine.<br> What makes you think that?<br> It's the greatest<br> encryption device in history,<br> and the Germans use it<br> for all major communications.<br> If the Allies broke Enigma,<br> well,<br> this would turn<br> into a very short war, indeed.<br> Of course that's what<br> you're working on.<br> But you also haven't got<br> anywhere with it.<br> If you had, you wouldn't<br> be hiring cryptographers<br> out of university.<br> Y-You need me a lot<br> more than I need you.<br> I-I like solving problems,<br> Commander.<br> And Enigma is the most<br> difficult problem in the world.<br> No, Enigma isn't difficult;<br> it's impossible.<br> The Americans, the Russians,<br> the French,<br> the Germans,<br> everyone thinks Enigma<br> is unbreakable.<br> Good.<br> Let me try,<br> and we'll know for sure,<br> won't we?<br> Welcome to Enigma.<br> The details of every<br> surprise attack,<br> every secret convoy<br> and every U-boat in<br> the bloody Atlantic<br> go into that thing.<br> And out comes gibberish.<br> It's beautiful.<br> It's the crooked<br> hand of death itself.<br> Our Wrens intercept thousands<br> of radio messages a day,<br> and to the lovely young ladies<br> of the Women's Royal Navy,<br> they're nonsense.<br> It's only when you feed<br> them back into Enigma<br> that they make any sense.<br> But we have an Enigma machine.<br> Yes, Polish Intelligence<br> smuggled it out of Berlin.<br> So what's the problem?<br> Just put<br> the intercepted messages<br> back into the Enigma<br> and you'll...<br> Look, it's not<br> that simple, is it?<br> Just having an Enigma machine<br> doesn't help you to decode<br> the messages.<br> Very good, Mr. Turing.<br> To decode a message, you need to<br> know the machine's settings.<br> Now, the Germans<br> switch settings<br> every day promptly at midnight.<br> We usually intercept<br> our first message<br> around 6:00 a.m.,<br> which gives you exactly<br> to crack the code<br> before it changes,<br> and you start again.<br> Five rotors.<br> Ten plugboard cables.<br> -That's... -One million...<br> -A thousand million...<br> No, no, it's,<br> uh, I've got it.<br> -It's million, million. -It's in<br> the millions, obviously.<br> It's over 150 million million<br> million possible settings.<br> Very good.<br> If you want to be<br> exact about it. 1-5-9<br> with 18 zeroes behind it.<br> Possibilities.<br> Every single day.<br> Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander.<br> I personally selected him<br> -to run this unit.<br> -Didn't you...<br> Mr. Alexander won Britain's<br> national chess championship.<br> Twice.<br> You're not the only one<br> who's good at games<br> around here, Turing.<br> Are-are we<br> to work together, then?<br> I prefer to have my own office.<br> You're a team,<br> and you will work as one.<br> I-I-I don't have time<br> to explain myself as I go along,<br> and I'm afraid these men<br> -would only slow me down.<br> -(chuckles) -If you can't<br> play together, then I'm afraid<br> we can't let you play at all.<br> This is Stewart Menzies, MI6.<br> There are only five divisions<br> of military intelligence.<br> There is no MI6.<br> Exactly.<br> That's the spirit.<br> Mr. Turing, do you know<br> how many British servicemen<br> have died because of Enigma?<br> Uh, no, I don't.<br> Three...<br> while we've been having<br> this conversation.<br> Oh, look, there's another.<br> I rather hope he<br> didn't have a family.<br> This war Commander Denniston's<br> been going on about,<br> we're not winning it.<br> Break the code,<br> at least we have a chance.<br> Shall we leave<br> the children alone<br> with their new toy?<br> Hm.<br> All right, gentlemen...<br> -let's play.<br> The game was quite a simple one.<br> Every single German message,<br> every surprise attack,<br> every bombing run,<br> every imminent U-boat assault...<br> They were all floating<br> through the air.<br> Radio signals that...<br> well, any schoolboy<br> with an AM kit<br> could intercept.<br> The trick was<br> that they were encrypted.<br> There were 159 million<br> million million possible<br> Enigma settings.<br> All we had to do<br> was try each one.<br> But if we had ten men checking<br> one setting a minute<br> for 24 hours every day<br> and seven days every week,<br> how many days do you think<br> it would take to, uh,<br> to check<br> each of the settings?<br> Well, it's not days, it's years.<br> Good morning.<br> It's 20 million years.<br> -To stop a coming attack,<br> -Thank you.<br> we would have to check<br> of settings<br> in 20 minutes.<br> I'm famished.<br> Lunch?<br> Good Lord. What is it<br> about women with little hats?<br> The boys, we're going<br> to get some lunch.<br> Alan?<br> Yes?<br> I said we're going<br> to get some lunch.<br> Alan?<br> Yes?<br> -Can you hear me?<br> -Yes.<br> I said we're<br> off to get some lu...<br> This is starting to get<br> a little bit repetitive.<br> -What is?<br> -I had asked<br> if you wanted to come<br> to lunch with us.<br> Um, no, you didn't.<br> You said you were going<br> to get some lunch.<br> Have I offended you in some way?<br> Why would you think that?<br> Would you like to come to lunch<br> with us?<br> -What time's lunchtime?<br> -Christ, Alan,<br> it's a bleeding sandwich.<br> -What is?<br> -Lunch.<br> Oh, I don't like sandwiches.<br> Never mind.<br> You know,<br> to pull off<br> this irascible genius routine,<br> one actually has to be<br> a genius, Alan.<br> And yet we're the ones<br> making progress here,<br> aren't we?<br> Oh, you are?<br> Yes, we are.<br> We have decrypted a number<br> of German messages<br> by analyzing the frequency<br> of letter distribution.<br> Oh, even a broken clock<br> is right twice a day.<br> That-That's not progress;<br> that's just blind luck.<br> I'm designing a machine<br> that will allow us<br> to break every message<br> every day instantly.<br> Who's hungry?<br> Let's go.<br> I'm hungry.<br> What?<br> Peter asked who was hungry.<br> Can I have some soup, please?<br> ...another break<br> in the circuit there.<br> What do you mean, "classified"?<br> No, I'm aware of the literal<br> meaning of the word classified.<br> What I'm asking is why would<br> a maths professor<br> have his military records<br> classified?<br> Yeah, well, I will come down.<br> WPC: Sorry, can I get you<br> to hold for a minute, please?<br> Pardon me, I'd like to see<br> some documents, if I may.<br> Service records<br> of a Mr. Turing.<br> Alan.<br> Foreign Office sent me.<br> This is unacceptable.<br> If you wish to discuss<br> the complaint,<br> I suggest you make<br> a proper appointment.<br> Alexan...<br> Complaint?<br> No, no, Hugh Alexander<br> has denied my requisition<br> for parts<br> and-and equipment that I need to<br> build the machine I've designed.<br> Your fellow code-breakers<br> are refusing to work with you,<br> and they filed<br> a formal complaint.<br> It's is inspired<br> by an old Polish code machine.<br> Only this one<br> is infinitely more advanced.<br> If you don't respond<br> to the complaint,<br> I shall have to take it up<br> with the Home Office.<br> Put those files by my desk.<br> Fine, my response is<br> they're all idiots.<br> Fire them and use the savings<br> to fund my machine.<br> I only need<br> about 100,000 pounds.<br> Why are you building a machine?<br> It's highly technical.<br> You wouldn't understand.<br> I suggest you make<br> the effort to try.<br> Enigma is...<br> an extremely<br> well-designed machine.<br> Our problem is that we're only<br> using men to try to beat it.<br> No, what if only a machine<br> can defeat another machine?<br> Well, that's not very technical.<br> Hugh Alexander is in charge<br> of your unit; he said no,<br> and that is that.<br> I simply don't have time<br> for this.<br> Have you ever won a war, Turing?<br> I have.<br> Do you know how it's done?<br> Order, discipline,<br> chain of command.<br> You're not at university<br> any longer.<br> You are a very small cog<br> in a very large system.<br> And you will do as your<br> commanding officer instructs.<br> Yes.<br> Who-who is<br> your commanding officer?<br> Winston Churchill,<br> Number 10 Downing Street,<br> London, SW1.<br> You have a problem<br> with my decision,<br> you can take it up with him.<br> TURING (voice-over):<br> Mr. Menzies!<br> Mr. Menzies!<br> A-A-Are you going to London?<br> Possibly.<br> Would you deliver<br> a letter for me?<br> Look, I'm sorry,<br> but are you joking?<br> Churchill's put Alan in charge?<br> -This is a terrible idea.<br> -No, no, no, no, no.<br> So I can give these<br> men orders now?<br> I hate to say it, but yes.<br> Excellent. Keith and Charles,<br> you're both fired.<br> -Excuse me?<br> -What?<br> You're mediocre linguists,<br> and positively<br> poor code-breakers.<br> Alan, you can't just<br> fire Keith and Charles.<br> Well, he just said I could.<br> No, I did no such thing.<br> But Churchill did.<br> Go to hell.<br> Well,<br> this is inhuman.<br> Even for you.<br> Popular at school, were you?<br> The problem began, of course,<br> with the carrots.<br> Carrots are orange.<br> And peas<br> are green.<br> They mustn't touch.<br> I got it.<br> Do you know why people<br> like violence?<br> It is because it feels...<br> good.<br> Humans find violence<br> deeply satisfying.<br> But remove the-the satisfaction,<br> and the act becomes...<br> -hollow.<br> Turing?<br> Come on.<br> Don't be such a kike about it.<br> Leave him to bloody rot.<br> I didn't learn this on my own,<br> of course.<br> I had help.<br> Christopher helped.<br> Alan, are you all right?<br> It's not my fault.<br> The carrots got in<br> with the peas and...<br> I'm sorry.<br> I won't let them do it again.<br> They're getting worse.<br> They only beat me up because<br> I'm smarter than they are.<br> No, they beat you up<br> because you're different.<br> Mother says<br> I'm just an odd duck.<br> And she's right.<br> But you know, Alan,<br> sometimes it's the very people<br> who no one imagines anything of<br> who do the things<br> no one can imagine.<br> So, what do we do now?<br> We're short on staff.<br> Well, we, uh, we get<br> more staff then.<br> And how do you propose<br> to do that?<br> Um, Alan Turing<br> to see Stewart Menzies.<br> Very good, sir.<br> So who are they?<br> Oh, all sorts, really.<br> Teacher, an engineer,<br> a handful of students.<br> And you think they're<br> qualified for Bletchley<br> 'cause they're good<br> at crossword puzzles?<br> Well, they say they're good,<br> and now we shall find out,<br> won't we?<br> In order to aid your efforts,<br> there is, to the right of you,<br> a green scratch card book.<br> You are to make notes in that.<br> Gentlemen, you<br> have six minutes<br> in which to complete the<br> puzzle, at which point,<br> I will...<br> Pardon, ma'am,<br> this room's restricted.<br> Oh, apologies<br> for my tardiness.<br> The-the bus caught a flat tire.<br> Uh, may I continue, please?<br> -Thank you. -You're not<br> allowed in here, ma'am.<br> Oh, but I'm only<br> a few minutes late.<br> The secretaries are<br> to head upstairs.<br> This room's for the candidates.<br> May I get on with<br> this now, please?<br> I-I am a candidate.<br> -For what position?<br> The letter didn't say precisely.<br> Yeah, so secretaries<br> are to head upstairs.<br> It did say<br> that it was top secret.<br> What is going on?<br> I-I solved<br> a-a crossword puzzle<br> in the newspaper,<br> and I-I got this letter saying<br> that I was a candidate for<br> some sort of mysterious job.<br> My name's Joan Clarke.<br> Miss, did you really solve<br> this puzzle yourself?<br> What makes you think I couldn't<br> solve the puzzle myself?<br> -I-I'm really very good at...<br> -Ma'am,<br> -I'll have to ask you to...<br> -Miss Clarke,<br> I-I find tardiness<br> under any circumstance,<br> um, unacceptable.<br> Take a seat so that<br> we may continue.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, um,<br> as I was saying,<br> you-you have six minutes<br> to, uh, complete the task<br> in front of you.<br> Uh, gentlemen and lady,<br> begin.<br> Six minutes.<br> Is that even possible?<br> No, it takes me eight.<br> This isn't about<br> crossword puzzles.<br> It's about how one, uh,<br> approaches solving an<br> impossible problem.<br> Do you tackle the whole thing<br> at once or divide it<br> into small...<br> You've finished?<br> Yes.<br> Five minutes and 34 seconds.<br> You said to do it in under six.<br> Congratulations.<br> My warmest welcome to<br> His Majesty's service.<br> If you speak a word<br> of what I'm about to show you,<br> you will be executed<br> for high treason.<br> You will lie to your friends,<br> your family<br> and everyone you meet<br> about what it is you really do.<br> And what is it<br> that we're really doing?<br> We're going to break<br> an unbreakable Nazi code<br> and win the war.<br> Oh.<br> What's that you're reading?<br> It's about cryptography.<br> Like secret messages?<br> Not secret.<br> That's the brilliant part.<br> Messages that anyone can see,<br> but no one knows what they mean<br> unless you have the key.<br> How's that different<br> from talking?<br> -Talking?<br> -When people talk to each other,<br> they never say what they mean.<br> They say something else,<br> and you're expected to<br> just know what they mean.<br> Only I never do.<br> So, how's that different?<br> Alan, I have a funny feeling<br> you're going to be<br> very good at this.<br> Good night, Alan.<br> Good night.<br> Hold on,<br> Marion, I'm coming!<br> Coming round the lesser settings<br> and then route back through...<br> -Back to those ones...<br> Uh, careful, will you?<br> Um, it-it's not a toy.<br> Funny.<br> Looks like a toy.<br> Bloody great<br> Your new minion's arrived.<br> Jack Good. We met...<br> Well, where's Miss Clarke?<br> Lovely, isn't he?<br> It's not just a-a usual<br> humdrum production mill factory.<br> I mean, well,<br> as-as I was saying,<br> it's a very important,<br> uh, radio factory.<br> I-It's not, actually.<br> Uh, well, um,<br> on the spectrum of,<br> uh... radio factories,<br> this-this one<br> is-is particularly...<br> Why are you not<br> at Bletchley?<br> Thank you... so much for<br> your visit, Mr. Turing.<br> -Was your trip pleasant? -Gather<br> your things and let's go.<br> I'm sorry, but I'm unable<br> to accept your offer.<br> We feel that<br> such a position<br> would hardly<br> be appropriate.<br> You earned a double first<br> in mathematics.<br> But sadly wasn't granted the<br> opportunity to become a Fellow.<br> You belong at Bletchley.<br> I'm sorry,<br> but for someone in my position<br> to live... to...<br> to work in a radio factory<br> so far from home,<br> with all your<br> men, um...<br> it-it would be...<br> indecorous.<br> What in the world<br> does that even mean?<br> We have a group of,<br> uh, young ladies<br> who tend to all of our<br> clerical tasks:<br> assistants, translators.<br> Uh, they live,<br> um, together in town.<br> W-W-Would that be a more,<br> uh, suitable environment?<br> Hm. So-so I would be working<br> amongst these women?<br> Yes.<br> Wonderful ladies. Uh, they<br> even organize social events<br> at St. Martin's Church<br> down the road.<br> Uh, really, the whole thing<br> is-is quite, uh...<br> uh, um...<br> decorous.<br> Now, you won't have proper<br> security clearance,<br> of course, so, uh, we'll have<br> to improvise things a bit.<br> Why are you helping me?<br> Because there is only<br> one thing that matters<br> in this entire world right<br> now-- do you understand?--<br> and that is<br> breaking Enigma.<br> But-but, Mr. Turing...<br> why are you helping me?<br> Oh. Um...<br> sometimes it's the very people<br> who no one imagines anything of<br> who do the things that<br> no one can imagine.<br> Sir.<br> -What's this? -Alan Turing's<br> classified military file.<br> -It's bloody empty.<br> -Exactly.<br> -It's an empty manila envelope.<br> -Yeah.<br> Well, you've cracked the case<br> wide open, then, haven't you?<br> Alan Turing's war records<br> aren't just classified,<br> they're nonexistent.<br> That means someone's<br> got rid of them.<br> Erased them.<br> Burned them.<br> And that same person broke into<br> his house and stole nothing?<br> Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.<br> What, the spies<br> from the papers?<br> The Soviet spies.<br> But first they were<br> professors, weren't they?<br> Radicalized at Cambridge,<br> then they joined<br> the Communist Party,<br> then Foreign Office,<br> then leaked information<br> to Stalin during<br> the war-- now,<br> can you think of anyone else<br> we know who was at Cambridge,<br> then took up something murky and<br> top secret when war broke out?<br> You think this Alan Turing<br> might be a Soviet agent?<br> I think...<br> something very serious<br> is happening<br> right here under our noses.<br> Wouldn't you like<br> to find out what it is?<br> Welcome, ladies.<br> If you'd like to follow me.<br> Some<br> people thought we were at war<br> with the Germans-- incorrect.<br> We were at war with the clock.<br> Britain was literally<br> starving to death.<br> The Americans sent over<br> and, uh, every week<br> the Germans would send<br> our desperately needed bread<br> to the bottom of the ocean.<br> Our daily failure was announced<br> at the chimes of midnight.<br> And the sound would haunt<br> our unwelcome dreams.<br> Tick...<br> tock...<br> tick.<br> Damn it!<br> -What just happened?<br> Midnight--<br> all the work we've done<br> today is useless.<br> Oh, but don't worry,<br> we've a few hours<br> before tomorrow's messages<br> start flooding in...<br> and we start<br> all over again.<br> From scratch.<br> I'm so sick of this.<br> Four hours rewiring<br> his plugboard matrix.<br> Three hours yesterday<br> on his rotor positions!<br> -Don't go over there.<br> -Look, John, no.<br> If this job wasn't<br> already impossible before,<br> -it bloody well is now.<br> -Hugh, don't.<br> Damn you and your<br> useless machine.<br> My machine is<br> how we are going to win.<br> Really?<br> This machine? Hmm?<br> Are you talking about<br> this bloody machine?!<br> -Hugh! Hugh! Hugh, don't!<br> -Hugh! Hugh! Stop!<br> You<br> arrogant bastard.<br> You could help us.<br> You could make this go<br> faster, but you won't.<br> Get off.<br> He's right, Alan.<br> There are...<br> actual soldiers out there<br> trying to win an actual war.<br> My brother<br> protects food convoys<br> in the Navy.<br> My cousins fly<br> RAF patrols.<br> All my friends,<br> they're all making a difference,<br> while we just...<br> while away our days<br> producing nothing.<br> Because of you.<br> My machine...<br> will work.<br> Come on, Peter.<br> Okay.<br> -Uh, will you...<br> -Could you make<br> a bit more noise?<br> I'm not quite sure<br> -my landlady woke up.<br> -Oh, sorry.<br> Oh, uh, look.<br> I think that's the<br> best I can do.<br> No male visitors<br> after dark.<br> So...<br> what did you bring me?<br> There you go.<br> Here.<br> Some men try flowers, you know.<br> These are actual<br> decrypted Enigma messages<br> direct from Nazi<br> High Command.<br> "0600 hours.<br> "Weather today is clear.<br> "Rain in the evening.<br> Heil Hitler."<br> Well, clearly,<br> that vital piece of information<br> is going to win us the war.<br> It's the relationship<br> between the encrypted<br> a-and decrypted messages<br> that interests me.<br> Can we find a clue here that<br> we can build into Christopher?<br> Who's Christopher?<br> Oh, he's, uh,<br> he's my machine.<br> You named him?<br> Is that a bad name?<br> No.<br> No, never mind.<br> Are you trying to build<br> your universal machine?<br> I read your paper<br> -at university.<br> -Is it already being taught?<br> No. No. No, I was precocious.<br> So...<br> you-you theorized<br> a machine that<br> could solve any problem.<br> It didn't just do one thing,<br> it did everything.<br> It wasn't just programmable,<br> it was reprogrammable.<br> Mm.<br> Is that your idea<br> behind Christopher?<br> Well, human brains can compute<br> large sums very quickly--<br> even Hugh can do that-- but I<br> want Christopher to be smarter.<br> To make a calculation<br> and then, uh...<br> to determine<br> what to do next.<br> Like a person does.<br> Think of it.<br> Electrical brain.<br> A digital computer.<br> Digital computer.<br> Hmm.<br> -What's going on?<br> What's happening?<br> No. No, no. No, no, no!<br> Don't touch that!<br> -Stay back.<br> -That's my desk.<br> Thank goodness.<br> I'd hate to think<br> we were searching<br> -the wrong one. -What are<br> you doing? What's going on?<br> There is a spy<br> in Bletchley Park.<br> The Navy thinks<br> that one of us<br> is a Soviet double<br> agent, Alan.<br> Uh... why?<br> Our boys intercepted this<br> on its way to Moscow.<br> Look familiar?<br> It's a Beale cipher.<br> Encrypted with a phrase<br> from a book or a poem or...<br> You don't seriously think<br> I did this, do you?<br> Double agents are<br> such bastards.<br> Isolated loners.<br> No attachments to<br> friends or family.<br> Arrogant.<br> Know anybody like that?<br> I...<br> Hm, I know you don't like me,<br> but that does<br> not make me<br> a Soviet spy.<br> Nothing<br> out of the ordinary, sir.<br> Really.<br> Mm, all right.<br> The Home Office may be<br> protecting you now,<br> but sooner or later<br> you will make a mistake.<br> And I needn't<br> bother firing you.<br> They will hang you<br> for treason.<br> Hello.<br> I heard about<br> what happened.<br> It's all the girls in<br> Hut 3 can talk about.<br> I have an idea<br> of what might cheer you up.<br> So because no letter<br> can be encoded as itself,<br> there's already a handful<br> of settings that can be<br> rejected at the outset.<br> Is that your team?<br> -Y-Yes.<br> -Shall we say hello?<br> -No.<br> -Hello.<br> I-I told you not t-to do that.<br> -Alan.<br> -Uh, Hugh, h-hello.<br> -Didn't know you drank.<br> -He doesn't, really.<br> He just sort of sips<br> at the foam.<br> Well, I'll let you into a<br> little secret, Miss...?<br> Clarke.<br> -Miss Clarke.<br> -Please.<br> Foam's my favorite part, too.<br> Is it really?<br> Come and join us<br> for a drink?<br> We'll be there<br> in a moment.<br> Miss Clarke.<br> Well, he likes you.<br> -Yes.<br> -You...<br> g-got him to like you.<br> Yes.<br> Why?<br> Because I'm a woman<br> in a man's job,<br> and I don't have the luxury<br> of being an ass.<br> Alan...<br> it doesn't matter<br> how smart you are,<br> Enigma is always smarter.<br> If you really<br> want to solve your puzzle,<br> then you're going to need<br> all the help<br> you can get,<br> and they are not going<br> to help you<br> if they do not like you.<br> -What are those?<br> -Apples.<br> -No.<br> -Oh, they really are.<br> Um, I... well, Miss Clarke,<br> Joan actually, um...<br> said that it would be...<br> (clears throat)<br> nice if I was to, uh,<br> bring you all something.<br> So here we are. I...<br> Thank you.<br> I like apples.<br> My best to Miss Clarke.<br> Uh, there are two people<br> in a wood,<br> and, um, they run into a bear.<br> The first person<br> gets down on his knees to pray.<br> The second person<br> starts lacing up his boots.<br> The first person<br> asks the second person,<br> "My dear friend,<br> what are you doing?<br> You-you-you<br> can't outrun a bear."<br> Uh, to which<br> the second person responds,<br> "I don't have to.<br> I only have to outrun you."<br> I'll be w-with Christopher,<br> if anyone needs me.<br> If we assume<br> that the square root of two<br> is a rational number,<br> then we can say<br> that the square<br> root of two<br> is A over B...<br> where A and B<br> are whole numbers<br> and B is not zero.<br> Mr. Turing,<br> passing notes, are we?<br> No, sir.<br> Only Turing would pass notes<br> written in gibberish.<br> -All right, gentlemen,<br> do not forget your algebra<br> over the break.<br> Have a pleasant holiday,<br> and we'll resume<br> your irrationals<br> when you return.<br> Mm.<br> But Euler's Theorem<br> gives you that immediately.<br> Um...<br> Here. Look at this.<br> If you run the wires across<br> the plugboard matrix diagonally,<br> it will eliminate rotor<br> positions 500 times faster.<br> That's, uh...<br> actually not an entirely<br> terrible idea.<br> I think that was Alan<br> for "thank you."<br> Uh, th-that's my sandwich.<br> You don't like sandwiches.<br> You nervous?<br> What happens now?<br> It-it should work out the<br> day's Enigma settings.<br> How long?<br> Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!<br> The German Army<br> has fanned out across Europe,<br> from Poland to Serbia,<br> Lithuania to Denmark,<br> Norway to France.<br> The Nazi flag now flies<br> from more than two dozen<br> national capitals.<br> Their campaign mounts in fury<br> as a free Europe crumbles.<br> Oh, it's still going.<br> -Good morning, sir.<br> -Morning, Margaret.<br> Gears keep spinning<br> on and on.<br> Rotors on and on.<br> It's endless.<br> With no result in sight?<br> -No.<br> Ow.<br> Turing.<br> Turing,<br> -open the bloody door.<br> -Uh, no.<br> No.<br> Open the door or<br> we'll break it down.<br> I can't let you in! I-I...<br> I cannot let you interfere.<br> Go on, then.<br> Turn that thing off.<br> No. Don't, please. Please.<br> Please! Please!<br> No!<br> N-No. No!<br> Don't!<br> Well, then, it seems<br> that your great big<br> expensive machine<br> doesn't work.<br> It does.<br> Wonderful.<br> So you've broken<br> Enigma, then?<br> It was just...<br> s-still working.<br> This is my associate<br> from the Home Office.<br> You see, a hundred<br> thousand pounds<br> is rather a<br> lot of money,<br> and he's here to see what<br> you have to show for it.<br> You... will never<br> understand<br> the importance of what<br> I-I am creating here!<br> Have you decrypted<br> any German messages?<br> A single one?<br> Can you point to anything<br> at all that you've achieved?<br> Hmm. Your funding is up,<br> and our patience<br> is expired.<br> It's with such<br> great pleasure<br> that I am finally<br> able to say this.<br> Alan Turing,<br> you're fired.<br> Please escort Mr. Turing<br> from the premises.<br> No.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> If you fire Alan...<br> well, then you'll<br> have to fire me, too.<br> What on earth are you saying?<br> Trust me when<br> I tell you there is no one<br> who would rather say this<br> less than I do, but...<br> he's right.<br> Alan is right.<br> His machine can work,<br> and it's probably<br> the best chance<br> that we've got.<br> God, it's beyond belief.<br> If you fire them...<br> you'll have to<br> fire me, too.<br> And me.<br> We're the best<br> cryptographic minds in Britain.<br> Are you going to fire us all?<br> Commander, at least<br> give us some more time.<br> Six months, and if the<br> machine doesn't produce<br> any results that we need,<br> then we'll go back<br> to doing things the old way--<br> how about that?<br> One month.<br> And then,<br> so help me God,<br> you're all gone.<br> Oh, leave him.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> Oh, and, Alan,<br> your machine...<br> ...it better bloody work.<br> Hugh.<br> I swear...<br> I'm not a spy.<br> Oh, for God's sake, of course<br> you're not a bloody spy.<br> What?<br> Denniston gave me<br> the Beale cipher,<br> and guess what?<br> I cracked it.<br> "Ask, and it shall<br> be given to you;<br> seek and ye shall find."<br> Matthew 7:7.<br> That was the key.<br> Far too simple<br> for the likes of you.<br> Pity Denniston disagrees.<br> -Come in.<br> Sir, I think I've got Turing.<br> I tailed him<br> to a pub last night,<br> where he met a bloke.<br> They exchanged<br> an envelope.<br> So I follow<br> this other fella,<br> pick him up,<br> give him a good shake.<br> He's a poofter.<br> He confessed.<br> What?<br> The man admitted it.<br> Arnold Murray.<br> Hangs around that pub;<br> men pay him for a go.<br> Turing's one of<br> the men that paid.<br> Only Mr. Murray here<br> then has the<br> bright idea<br> of robbing Turing's house<br> after, with a friend.<br> That's what Turing's hiding.<br> Well, he's a poof, not a spy.<br> -No.<br> -What's the matter?<br> We can charge a<br> university professor<br> -with indecency.<br> -No, this is...<br> it's bloody rubbish.<br> Turing's up<br> to something important...<br> He's committed a crime<br> and he's broken the law.<br> And with a bloke.<br> Jesus Christ,<br> -it's bloody disgusting.<br> -This isn't<br> the investigation<br> I was conducting.<br> Bring him in.<br> Wait.<br> L-Let me interrogate him.<br> Please. Give me<br> half an hour alone,<br> and then I swear,<br> I'll spend the next month<br> running errands on as many<br> rubbish cases as you like.<br> Fine. Now,<br> will someone get me a warrant<br> for the arrest of Alan Turing.<br> Alan?<br> Christopher's simply<br> not moving fast enough.<br> -We should talk. -And even<br> with the diagonal board,<br> he's still not eliminating<br> settings as quickly<br> -as we need him to in order...<br> -I'm leaving.<br> But you've<br> just walked in.<br> No.<br> No. Bletchley.<br> What?<br> It's my parents.<br> I'm 25, I'm unmarried,<br> I'm living alone,<br> and they want me home.<br> That's ridiculous.<br> That's my parents.<br> You... you can't leave--<br> I-I won't let you.<br> "I'll miss you." That's<br> what a normal person<br> -might say in this situation.<br> -I-I don't care what is normal.<br> What am I supposed<br> to do, Alan?<br> I-I will not...<br> give up my parents.<br> (laughs)<br> You... you have<br> an opportunity here<br> to make some actual use<br> of your life.<br> And end up like you?<br> No, thanks.<br> -I'm sorry you're lonely.<br> But Enigma<br> will not save you.<br> Can you decipher that,<br> you fragile narcissist?<br> Or would you like me<br> to go and fetch<br> your precious Christopher<br> to help?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Mm...<br> I want you... I want you to stay<br> because I-I like you.<br> I like...<br> talking to you.<br> I like talking to you,<br> too, Alan.<br> And what if you weren't alone?<br> What if you had a husband?<br> Do you have one in mind?<br> I do.<br> Hugh?<br> Hugh's terribly attractive,<br> I'll give you that,<br> but I don't really think<br> he's the marrying kind.<br> No, I-I wasn't<br> thinking of Hugh.<br> Or Peter.<br> Peter's so quiet.<br> Oh, my God.<br> But this makes sense.<br> Did you just propose to me?<br> Well, it is<br> the logical thing to do.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> This is your parents.<br> I-I can't... believe<br> that this is happening.<br> Mm. Joan...<br> Is your middle name<br> Caroline or Catherine?<br> -Elizabeth.<br> -Um, Joan Elizabeth...<br> Clarke, um...<br> ...will you marry me?<br> It's beautiful.<br> Well, I know<br> it isn't ordinary, but...<br> whoever loved ordinary?<br> She had it<br> in both hands... -<br> and she looked up at me<br> with her doe eyes and said,<br> "Am I supposed<br> to put that in my mouth?"<br> And I said, "Yes.<br> You know, the French way."<br> So she pops it in,<br> clamps her lips around it,<br> and starts humming<br> the bloody Marseillaise.<br> Come have a dance.<br> No, no,<br> no, you can dance<br> with your fiance<br> anytime you like.<br> Right now, this moment...<br> -my turn.<br> What's the matter?<br> Wh-What if...<br> Wh-What if I don't<br> fancy being...<br> with Joan i-in that way?<br> Because you're<br> a homosexual?<br> I suspected.<br> Well, should-should I tell her<br> that I've had...<br> affairs with men?<br> You know, in my...<br> admittedly<br> limited experience,<br> women... tend<br> to be a bit touchy<br> about accidentally<br> marrying homosexuals.<br> Perhaps not spreading<br> this information about might be<br> in your best interest.<br> I care for her,<br> I truly do. I...<br> I-I... I just don't know<br> if I can, um... pretend.<br> You can't tell anyone, Alan.<br> It's illegal.<br> And Denniston is looking<br> for any excuse he can<br> to put you away.<br> I know.<br> This has to<br> stay a secret.<br> Come on, it's your turn.<br> Ah. Okay.<br> Cup of tea?<br> No, thank you.<br> Mr. Turing, can I<br> tell you a secret?<br> I'm quite good<br> with those.<br> I'm here to help you.<br> Oh, clearly.<br> Can machines think?<br> Oh, so you've read some<br> of my published works?<br> What makes you<br> say that?<br> Well, because I'm sitting<br> in a police station,<br> accused of entreating<br> a young man to touch my penis<br> and you just asked me<br> if machines can think.<br> Well, can they?<br> Could machines ever think<br> as human beings do?<br> Most people say not.<br> You're not most people.<br> Well, the problem is you're...<br> asking a stupid question.<br> I am?<br> Of course machines...<br> can't think as people do.<br> A machine is different...<br> from a person.<br> Hence, they think differently.<br> The interesting question is,<br> just because something, uh,<br> thinks differently from you,<br> does that mean<br> it's not thinking?<br> Well, we allow for humans<br> to have such divergences<br> from one another.<br> You like strawberries,<br> I hate ice-skating,<br> you... cry at sad films,<br> I... am allergic to pollen.<br> What is the point<br> of-of different tastes,<br> different... preferences<br> if not to say that<br> our brains work differently,<br> that we think differently?<br> And if we can say that<br> about one another,<br> then why can't we say<br> the same thing for brains...<br> built of copper and wire, steel?<br> And that's...<br> this big paper you wrote?<br> What's it called?<br> "The Imitation Game."<br> Right, that's...<br> that's what it's about?<br> Would you like to play?<br> Play?<br> It's a game.<br> A test of sorts.<br> For determining<br> whether something is a...<br> a machine or a human being.<br> How do I play?<br> Well, there's a judge<br> and a subject, and...<br> the judge asks questions,<br> and, depending<br> on the subject's answers,<br> determines who<br> he is talking with...<br> what he is talking with,<br> and, um...<br> All you have to do<br> is ask me a question.<br> What did you do<br> during the war?<br> I worked in a radio factory.<br> What did you really do<br> during the war?<br> (laughs softly)<br> Are you paying attention?<br> Damn it!<br> We're soon out of time. A month.<br> So that's it, then, is it?<br> Oh, the trouble is, it doesn't<br> matter how much we improve it.<br> The machine's never<br> gonna be able to process<br> possibilities in time.<br> It's just<br> bloody hopeless.<br> It's searching.<br> It's just...<br> It... doesn't know<br> what it's searching for.<br> If we knew what the messages<br> were going to say...<br> If we knew what the messages<br> were going to say,<br> we wouldn't have<br> to decrypt them at all.<br> Who's Alan's friend?<br> Hugh. He's a bit<br> of a cad, actually.<br> So my type, then?<br> -Well, I'll introduce you.<br> -No.<br> He'll come over.<br> -Are you sure?<br> -Yes.<br> I smiled at him<br> and haven't<br> looked back since.<br> Who's that with Joan?<br> Hmm?<br> Uh, Helen. Works with her.<br> She's really pretty.<br> She wants me<br> to come over.<br> What? H-How on earth<br> can you know that?<br> She smiled at me<br> a while back<br> and she hasn't<br> looked again since.<br> And got him.<br> Now, why is this,<br> that when I was single<br> I found it very boring,<br> but now that I'm engaged,<br> I just find it<br> dreadfully fun.<br> Bingo. She's in.<br> Alan, introduce us.<br> What? Wh-Why me?<br> Because there's nothing<br> like a friend's engagement<br> to make a woman want to do<br> something she'll later regret<br> with the fiance's<br> better looking chum.<br> Let's go.<br> Half a crown says Alan<br> bollixes this up entirely.<br> -No bet.<br> -Alan Turing has a theory.<br> -JOAN: He has many.<br> He believes that<br> the regulations<br> against men and women working<br> side by side are sound<br> because such proximity will<br> necessarily lead to romance.<br> What? No,<br> I don't. I...<br> However...<br> I disagree.<br> -You do?<br> -Yeah.<br> I think that if I were working<br> beside a woman all day long,<br> I could appreciate her<br> abilities and intellect<br> without taking<br> her to bed.<br> I'm sorry, have we met?<br> I don't recall.<br> But let's assume we haven't.<br> Helen Stewart.<br> Hugh Alexander.<br> So who do you<br> agree with,<br> -Alan or myself?<br> -Well, Alan, of course.<br> I-I'm very flattered, really,<br> but I-I don't think...<br> Rubbish. -<br> Well, I work beside a man<br> every day,<br> and I can't help<br> but have developed<br> a bit of a crush on him.<br> Well, who is this man?<br> So I can kick his arse.<br> Well, there's no need<br> to worry-- it's been chaste.<br> We've never even met.<br> He's a German.<br> -Now I really want to kill him.<br> How-how do you mean<br> you work alongside a German?<br> Well, each of us<br> intercepts messages<br> from a specific<br> German radio tower.<br> So we have a counterpart<br> on the other side<br> who's tip-tapping out<br> the messages.<br> Everyone types<br> a touch differently,<br> so you get to know the rhythm<br> of your counterpart.<br> It's strangely intimate.<br> I feel as if<br> I know him so well.<br> It's a pity<br> he has a girlfriend,<br> but that's why I disagree<br> with you, Mr. Alexander.<br> Because I'm in love<br> with a coworker of sorts,<br> and we've never even met.<br> Well, allow me to buy<br> you another pint,<br> and I'll tell you<br> why you're wrong.<br> Let's.<br> Excellent.<br> Thanks.<br> Um, pints.<br> Have you got any sloe gin?<br> In case you were wondering,<br> that's what flirting looks like.<br> TURING<br> Helen...<br> Really, no<br> cigarettes?<br> Alan...<br> Yes, Alan?<br> Wh-Why do you think<br> -your German counterpart<br> has a girlfriend? -It's just<br> -a stupid joke; don't worry.<br> -No, no, no, no. Tell me.<br> Well, each of his messages<br> begins with the same<br> five letters:<br> C-I-L-L-Y.<br> So I suspect that Cilly<br> must be the name<br> -of his amore.<br> -But that's impossible.<br> The Germans are instructed<br> to use five random letters<br> at the start of every message.<br> Well, this bloke doesn't.<br> Love will make a man do<br> strange things, I suppose.<br> In this case, love just lost<br> Germany the whole bloody war.<br> Oh!<br> Go, Peter.<br> Sorry.<br> Alan! Alan!<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<br> Hey, hey, hey! -Alan!<br> -I just want...<br> Hugh Alexander.<br> John Cairncross.<br> Peter bloody Hilton.<br> Alan? What-wha...?<br> What...<br> what if...<br> what if Christopher<br> doesn't have to search<br> through all of the settings?<br> What if he only has<br> to search through<br> ones that produce words<br> we already know will be<br> -in the message? -Repeated<br> words; predictable words.<br> Exactly.<br> Look, look, like this one.<br> "0600 hours. Weather<br> today is clear.<br> Rain in the evening.<br> Heil Hitler."<br> Well, that's it.<br> Exactly.<br> They send a weather report<br> every day at 6:00 a.m.<br> So that's-that's three<br> words we know will be<br> in every 6:00 a.m. message--<br> "weather," obviously,<br> -a-and...<br> -Heil bloody Hitler.<br> Heil bloody Hitler.<br> Here's the 6:00<br> message from this morning.<br> Hugh, the, uh,<br> the right-hand letter wheel,<br> set them to...<br> I know, I know.<br> "Weather" and "Hitler."<br> Peter, John, run voltages<br> through those letters,<br> -through the back scramblers.<br> -PETER: So we'll use the loops?<br> TURING: Yes. Joan, what was<br> the last 6:00 a.m. message?<br> -L...<br> -L...<br> H...<br> H...<br> -W...<br> W...<br> A...<br> -A...<br> -Q.<br> -Q.<br> Done.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Come on, Christopher.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Wh-What happened?<br> -Did it work?<br> -Alan?<br> Alan! Alan!<br> I need a new message.<br> The latest intercept.<br> Thank you.<br> O... T...<br> Ready?<br> -Yes.<br> -M...<br> -M...<br> -Y...<br> -Y...<br> -M... S...<br> -M... S...<br> -A...

Hugh! Hugh!<br> That's enough!<br> -That's enough!<br> Stop, Hugh!<br> John, the attack is in minutes.<br> Yes, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.<br> I'm fine.<br> You know why people<br> like violence, Hugh?<br> It's because it feels good.<br> Sometimes we can't do<br> what feels good.<br> We have to do what is logical.<br> What's logical?<br> Hardest time to lie to somebody<br> is when they're expecting<br> to be lied to.<br> Oh, God.<br> What?<br> If someone's waiting for a lie,<br> you can't just,<br> uh, give them one.<br> Damn it, Alan's right.<br> What?<br> What would<br> the Germans think if we destroy<br> their U-boats?<br> Nothing. They'll be dead.<br> No.<br> No, you can't be right.<br> So our convoy<br> suddenly veers off course...<br> a squadron of our air bombers<br> miraculously descends on the<br> coordinates of the U-boats--<br> what will the Germans think?<br> The Germans will know<br> that we have broken Enigma.<br> They'll stop all<br> radio communications by midday,<br> and they'll have changed<br> the design of Enigma<br> -by the weekend.<br> Yes.<br> Two years' work.<br> Everything that<br> we've done here<br> will all be for nothing.<br> There are 500<br> civilians in that convoy.<br> Women...<br> children.<br> We're about to let them die.<br> Our job i-is<br> not to save one<br> passenger convoy, it is to win<br> -the war.<br> -Our job was to crack Enigma.<br> We've done that.<br> Now for the hard part.<br> -Keeping it a secret.<br> Carlisle.<br> What?<br> The convoy you're about to...<br> it's, uh...<br> The HMS Carlisle<br> is one of the ships.<br> We can't act<br> on every piece of intelligence.<br> So fine, we won't.<br> Just this one.<br> Peter, what's<br> the matter with you?<br> My-my brother's...<br> well, he's on the Carlisle.<br> A gunnery ensign.<br> I'm...<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Who the hell<br> do you think you are?<br> This... this is my brother.<br> He's my big brother,<br> all right, and you have<br> a few minutes<br> to call off his murder.<br> We can't.<br> He's right.<br> Alan.<br> Joan.<br> Hugh.<br> John.<br> Please, I...<br> The-the Germans, they<br> won't get suspicious<br> just because<br> we stop one attack.<br> No one will know.<br> (pants)<br> I'm asking you...<br> as your friend.<br> Please.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> You're not God, Alan--<br> you don't get to decide<br> who lives and who dies.<br> Yes, we do.<br> Why?<br> Because no one else can.<br> Why are you telling me this?<br> We need your help to keep<br> this a secret from...<br> Admiralty, Army, RAF.<br> Uh, no one can know<br> we broke Enigma.<br> Not even Denniston.<br> Who's in the process<br> of having you fired.<br> You can take care of that.<br> While we develop a system<br> to help you determine<br> how much<br> intelligence<br> to act on--<br> which a-attacks to stop,<br> which to let through.<br> Statistical<br> analysis.<br> The minimal number of actions<br> it would take for us<br> to win the war...<br> but the maximum number<br> we can take<br> before the Germans<br> get suspicious.<br> And you're going to trust<br> all this to statistics?<br> -To maths?<br> -Correct.<br> And then MI6 can come up<br> with the lies<br> that we tell everybody else.<br> You'll need a believable<br> alternative source for all<br> -the pieces of information<br> you use. -A false story<br> so that we can explain<br> how we got our information<br> that has nothing to do<br> with Enigma.<br> And then you can leak those<br> stories to the, uh, the Germans.<br> And then to our own military.<br> Maintain a conspiracy<br> of lies<br> at the highest levels<br> of government.<br> Sounds right up my alley.<br> Alan, I so rarely<br> have cause to say this,<br> but you are exactly the man<br> I always hoped you would be.<br> They code-named it "Ultra."<br> It became the largest store<br> of military intelligence<br> in, uh...<br> the history of the world.<br> It was like having a tap<br> on Himmler's intercom.<br> I-E-O...<br> Secrecy<br> became the primary concern,<br> and for some reason, they...<br> they trusted me.<br> Peter... do you<br> have the, uh,<br> the-the 630 decryp...<br> ...it's a Beale cipher<br> encrypted with a phrase<br> from a book or...<br> "Ask,<br> and it will be given to you;<br> seek and you will find."<br> Matthew 7:7.<br> That was the key.<br> Peter will come<br> around eventually.<br> Jack.<br> Could you give Alan and<br> me a moment, please?<br> The Soviets and us,<br> we're on the same side.<br> What I'm doing<br> will help Britain.<br> I-I have to tell Denniston.<br> No, you don't.<br> Because if you tell<br> him my secret...<br> I'll tell him yours.<br> Do you know what they<br> do to homosexuals?<br> You'll never be able<br> to work again,<br> never be able to teach.<br> Your precious machine...<br> I doubt you'll<br> ever see him again.<br> Hello. Can I... can I, um,<br> speak to Stewart Menzies,<br> please? It's urgent.<br> One moment, please.<br> Hello. Menzies.<br> Some<br> advice about keeping secrets.<br> It's a lot easier if you don't<br> know them in the first place.<br> Were they steaming my letters,<br> tapping my telephone?<br> Trailing my nervous walks?<br> You know, I...<br> I never did find out.<br> Joan?<br> Joan?<br> What's...<br> Uh...<br> where's Joan?<br> Military prison.<br> What have you done?<br> Decoded Enigma intercepts.<br> I found a pile of them<br> -in the bedside table.<br> -No, no. I-I gave those to her<br> over a year ago when<br> I was trying to figure out<br> -a link between...<br> -I'm sure you did.<br> Denniston's been looking<br> for a Soviet spy.<br> He's been looking inside Hut 8.<br> I know who the spy is.<br> It's not Joan.<br> It's...<br> it's Cairncross.<br> I-I found the Beale cipher,<br> the Bible.<br> God, I wish you'd been a spy.<br> You'd be so much better<br> at this than he is.<br> You knew it was him?<br> Of course I bloody knew.<br> I knew before<br> he came to Bletchley.<br> Why do you think<br> I had him placed here?<br> But we have<br> an Enigma machine.<br> Yeah, Polish Intelligence...<br> You-you placed<br> a... a Soviet agent<br> at Bletchley Park?<br> It's really quite useful<br> to be able<br> to leak whatever<br> we want to Stalin.<br> Churchill's too damn paranoid.<br> He won't share a shred<br> of intelligence<br> with the Soviets.<br> Not even information that will<br> help them against the Germans.<br> There's...<br> so much secrecy.<br> Cairncross has no idea<br> we know, of course.<br> He's really not<br> the brightest bulb.<br> Which is why I need your help.<br> I want to know<br> what to leak to John,<br> what to feed to the Soviets,<br> as well as<br> the British.<br> I... I'm not a spy.<br> I'm... I'm just a mathematician.<br> I know a lot of spies, Alan.<br> You've got more secrets<br> than the best of them.<br> You... you have to promise me<br> that you will release Joan.<br> Yes, Joan's at the market.<br> She's gonna be back<br> in an hour. I lied.<br> I better hold on<br> to these.<br> If anybody finds out about them,<br> prison will be<br> the least of her worries.<br> Oh, Alan...<br> we're gonna have such a<br> wonderful war together.<br> I need you to leave Bletchley.<br> -What? -It's Menzies.<br> I don't trust him.<br> It's not safe here.<br> -Do you think it's any safer<br> -anywhere else?<br> -You need to get away.<br> You need to get<br> very far away from me.<br> Alan, what's happened?<br> We can't be<br> engaged anymore.<br> You... your parents<br> need to take you back<br> and find you<br> a husband elsewhere.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> I have something,<br> uh, uh, to tell you.<br> I'm...<br> I'm a homosexual.<br> All right.<br> No, no. M-Men, Joan...<br> uh, not women.<br> -So what?<br> -Well,<br> I-I just told you.<br> So what?<br> I had my suspicions;<br> I always did.<br> But we're not like<br> other people.<br> We love each other<br> in our own way,<br> and we can have the life<br> together that we want.<br> You-you... you won't be<br> the perfect husband.<br> Well,<br> I can promise you,<br> I have no intention of<br> being the perfect wife.<br> I'll not be... fixing<br> your lamb all day<br> while you come home<br> from the office.<br> I'll work.<br> You'll work.<br> And we'll have<br> each other's company.<br> We'll have each other's minds.<br> That sounds like<br> a better marriage than most.<br> Because I care for you.<br> And you care for me.<br> And we understand one another<br> more than...<br> more than anyone else ever has.<br> I don't.<br> -What?<br> -Care for you.<br> I never did.<br> I-I just needed you<br> to break Enigma.<br> I've done that now,<br> so... so you can go.<br> I'm not going anywhere.<br> I've spent entirely<br> too much of my life<br> worried about what<br> you think of me,<br> or what my parents<br> think of me,<br> or the boys in Hut 8<br> or the girls in Hut 3.<br> And do you know<br> what? I'm done.<br> This is the most important<br> work I will ever do,<br> and no one is<br> going to stop me.<br> Least of all, you.<br> You know what,<br> they were right.<br> Peter, Hugh, John.<br> You really are a monster.<br> The war dragged on<br> for two more...<br> solitary years...<br> and every day we performed<br> our blood-soaked calculus.<br> Every day we decided<br> who lived and who died.<br> Every day we...<br> helped the Allies to victories,<br> and nobody knew.<br> -Stalingrad.<br> The Ardenne.<br> The invasion of Normandy.<br> All victories that<br> would not have been possible<br> without the intelligence<br> that we supplied.<br> And people...<br> talk about the war as<br> this epic battle between, um...<br> civilizations...<br> freedom versus tyranny,<br> democracy versus Nazism,<br> armies of millions<br> bleeding into the ground,<br> fleets of ships<br> weighing down the oceans,<br> planes dropping bombs<br> from the sky<br> until they obliterated<br> the sun itself...<br> (birds chirping)<br> The war wasn't like that for us.<br> For us, it was just...<br> ...half a dozen<br> crossword enthusiasts<br> in a tiny village<br> in the South of England.<br> WINSTON CHURCHILL:<br> This is...<br> your victory.<br> -Victory...<br> of the cause of freedom<br> in every land.<br> PRESIDENT TRUMAN: This is<br> a solemn but glorious hour.<br> I wish that<br> Franklin D.

With a bit<br> of luck, you'll never have<br> to see me or one another again<br> for the rest of your lives.<br> That's unbelievable.<br> Now, Detective,<br> you get to judge.<br> So, tell me...<br> what am I?<br> Mm, am I...<br> a machine?<br> Am I a person?<br> Am I a war hero?<br> Am I a criminal?<br> I can't judge you.<br> Well, then...<br> ...you're no help to me at all.<br> Come in.<br> You wanted to<br> see me, sir?<br> Turing. Sit down.<br> Something the matter?<br> You and Christopher Morcom<br> are quite close.<br> I wouldn't say that.<br> Well, your<br> mathematics teacher<br> says the two of you<br> are positively inseparable.<br> We're the best students<br> in the class.<br> He caught you passing notes<br> the other day.<br> Cryptography, to pass the time.<br> The class is too simple.<br> You and your friend solve maths<br> problems during maths class<br> because the maths class<br> is too dull?<br> He's not my friend.<br> Well, I'm told<br> he's your only friend.<br> Who said that?<br> Something's come up<br> concerning Morcom.<br> Why am I here?<br> Christopher is dead.<br> I don't understand.<br> His mother sent word<br> this morning.<br> The family were<br> on holiday, you see.<br> I don't understand.<br> Well, he had<br> bovine tuberculosis,<br> as I'm sure he told you.<br> So this won't come<br> as a shock, but...<br> still, all the same,<br> I'm sorry.<br> You're mistaken.<br> Did he not tell you?<br> Well, he's been sick<br> for a long time.<br> He knew this<br> was coming soon.<br> But he had a stiff<br> upper lip about it.<br> Good lad.<br> -Are you all right, Turing?<br> -Yes. Of course.<br> Like I said,<br> I didn't know him very well.<br> Ah. I see.<br> Very well.<br> May I leave, Headmaster?<br> Congratulations, sir.<br> Sorry.<br> I would have come.<br> I would have testified.<br> And what would you have said,<br> that I, uh...<br> I wasn't a homosexual.<br> Alan... this is serious.<br> They could send<br> you to jail.<br> Damn it.<br> Your hands.<br> You're twitching.<br> No-no, I'm not.<br> -Alan.<br> -Uh...<br> It's the medication.<br> The medication?<br> Uh, well, the judge<br> gave me, um, a choice--<br> uh, ei-either<br> two years in prison<br> or... ho-hormonal therapy.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Yes, yes, that's right.<br> Chemical castration.<br> Um, to, uh, to cure me<br> of my, um...<br> homosexual predilections.<br> Well, of course<br> I chose that.<br> I mean, I... couldn't...<br> work in prison, and, uh...<br> All right.<br> Now, I-I'm going to<br> speak to your doctors.<br> -I'm going to speak<br> to your lawyers. -I'm-I'm fine.<br> -Please let me help you. -No,<br> I, uh, don't need your help,<br> thank you.<br> Alan, you do not have<br> to do this alone.<br> I'm not alone.<br> Never have been.<br> Christopher's<br> become so smart.<br> If-if I don't continue<br> my treatment,<br> then they'll, um...<br> ...they'll take him<br> away from me.<br> You...<br> You-you can't let<br> them do that. You can't.<br> You... you can't let<br> them leave me alone.<br> I don't...<br> I don't want to be alone.<br> -I don't want to be alone.<br> -All ri... all right, all right.<br> All right.<br> It's all right.<br> Come and sit down.<br> It's all right.<br> Come and sit down.<br> -It's all right.<br> Oh, well, that's a...<br> that's a much nicer ring<br> -than the one I-I made you.<br> Yes. His name's Jock.<br> He's an Army man,<br> if you can believe it.<br> -We work together.<br> Why don't we do<br> a crossword puzzle.<br> It'll only take us<br> five minutes.<br> Or, in your case, six.<br> There.<br> Uh...<br> Uh...<br> Uh, p... perhaps later.<br> Yes, of course.<br> You-you got what<br> you wanted, didn't you?<br> Work, a husband.<br> Normal life.<br> No one normal could<br> have done that.<br> Do you know,<br> this morning...<br> I was<br> on a train<br> that went through a city<br> that wouldn't exist<br> if it wasn't for you.<br> I bought a ticket<br> from a man<br> who would likely be dead<br> if it wasn't for you.<br> I read up<br> on my work...<br> a whole field of<br> scientific inquiry<br> that only exists<br> because of you.<br> Now, if you wish you<br> could have been normal...<br> I can promise<br> you I do not.<br> The world is an<br> infinitely better place<br> precisely because<br> you weren't.<br> Do you...<br> do you really think that?<br> I think...<br> that sometimes<br> it is the people<br> who no one imagines<br> anything of<br> who do the things<br> that no one can imagine.<br>
