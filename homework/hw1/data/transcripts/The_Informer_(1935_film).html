Go on! Go and get your 20 pounds<br> from that scut I threw in the gutter.<br> Say, Gypo.<br> Too good for me, eh?<br> Well, let me tell you something.<br> You're no better than any<br> other man. You're all alike!<br> Oh, Katie, I didn't mean it.<br> Go along with you<br> and your fine principles.<br> I can't afford 'em!<br> Katie!<br> Throw light over there, lads.<br> Paddy's not out tonight, boys.<br> Don't you know me, Gypo?<br> I don't wonder that you stare.<br> I'm lucky to be finding you here.<br> Man, what is it?<br> What are you staring at?<br> Nothing, Frankie.<br> You came up to me so...<br> sudden like.<br> I guess I'm getting jumpy.<br> Finding out there's<br> a price on my head.<br> Oh, so that's all I'm worth!<br> Six months is a long time,<br> my boy, to be on the run.<br> Sleeping out in the hills,<br> freezing to death.<br> And no decent grub.<br> So I says to myself, "I'll sneak<br> into town and I'll see my mother."<br> "And I'll duck right out again."<br> And here I am.<br> Did you deliver my messages?<br> And what did my mother say?<br> Ah, she blessed the saints<br> that you're alive.<br> She followed me out crying<br> and put a half a quid in my hand.<br> To give to you.<br> Well, I was that hungry meself<br> that I... I spent it.<br> Ah, you big lubber.<br> That was her way of giving it to you!<br> She likes you, Gypo.<br> The Lord knows why.<br> What's come over you?<br> What are you gawking at?<br> Is there something queer about me?<br> No, Frankie.<br> You see,<br> I've been court-martialled.<br> Man, what for?<br> You remember the Tan<br> that killed Quincannon?<br> We drew lots for it,<br> and I got the short match.<br> Well, I took him out in the lorry...<br> and he begged for his life.<br> I couldn't do it, Frankie.<br> Not in cold blood.<br> Besides, he swore he'd desert<br> if I let him go.<br> And you believed him?<br> What did Commandant Gallagher say?<br> Oh.<br> He near had me plugged<br> when I went back to report.<br> Then they threw me out<br> of the organisation.<br> And now the British think<br> I'm with the Irish<br> and the Irish think<br> I'm with the British.<br> And the long and short of it is<br> I'm walking around starving<br> without a dog to lick my trousers.<br> Ah, you poor fathead!<br> Think of the jobs<br> we've pulled off together,<br> the scrapes we've come through.<br> Ah, we were a great pair, eh, Gypo?<br> With your muscle and my brain.<br> When you got into a tight place,<br> it was me that thought a way out.<br> Remember?<br> And I leave you alone for a minute<br> and you go and get in trouble again.<br> Man alive! I'm your brain!<br> But it's your help I'm needing now.<br> I looked you up first to find out<br> if the Tans were still watching<br> my mother's house.<br> Is there any guard on the house?<br> Not since Christmas.<br> Well, I'm off. If I get a chance to see<br> Gallagher, I'll put the word in for you.<br> Up the rebels!<br> Carry on.<br> Yes?<br> Well, I... It's like this. I...<br> Well, speak up.<br> What do you want to say?<br> I've come to claim the 20 pounds reward<br> for Frankie McPhillip.<br> Frankie McPhillip?<br> Right now, men, let's go.<br> Mary, the bread's that fresh,<br> I can't cut it.<br> Look at the crumbs it's made.<br> Oh, my boy! My boy!<br> - Mother! Mary!<br> - Oh, Frankie!<br> Oh, praise be to God.<br> You've come back to us.<br> Save your praise for this fog<br> that's upon us, Mother.<br> It's the best friend I have<br> this night.<br> And me dodging down dark streets to get<br> here. Oh, I was so homesick to see you.<br> I'd have walked down the middle of<br> O'Connell Street to get a glimpse of you.<br> Ah, mercy, my son.<br> Sure, you must be starving!<br> Frankie, you shouldn't have come.<br> It's not safe.<br> Ah, what a long face for a sister.<br> I'm in with the fog and I'm out with<br> the fog and nobody'll be the wiser.<br> - Nobody's seen you?<br> - Just my pal Gypo Nolan.<br> See, I had to find out<br> if the Tans had a guard on the house.<br> Have a nice cup of tea.<br> You can do all your talking afterwards.<br> Come on, get on the front door there.<br> Get on the door there.<br> Machine gunner! Machine gunner!<br> Get on the rear.<br> Open the place.<br> - No. No!<br> - Let me out!<br> Out of the way.<br> Stay back. Stay back! Stay back.<br> Get back. I gotta get away.<br> Frankie, no!<br> - Where's McPhillip?<br> - He's not here. Get out!<br> No, Frankie! Frankie!<br> Mary! Clear out of the way!<br> Get out of the way and let me shoot!<br> Dammit! Get out of the way!<br> Move out!<br> Frankie!<br> Frankie, no! Stop!<br> Frankie!<br> Yes?<br> Yes.<br> Right.<br> McPhillip was killed<br> trying to escape, sir.<br> Show him out the back way.<br> Why, you!<br> Whisky.<br> Oh-ho! There's a lot of things I'd like<br> if I could afford it.<br> Good night.<br> I've got to have a plan.<br> I've got to have a plan.<br> Ah, Gypo, I'm your brain.<br> You can't think without me.<br> You're lost. You're lost.<br> Oh. What do you want to be<br> sneaking up behind a man like that for?<br> I've been looking all over for you.<br> I'm...<br> I'm sorry I blew up at you like that -<br> out in the street, I mean.<br> Ah, Gypo.<br> You know I love you.<br> You're the only one. You know that.<br> Sometimes I get so crazy<br> I don't know what I'm doing.<br> I've got it. I did it for you.<br> You did what?<br> You forgot your change, me boyo.<br> Gypo, where did you<br> get that money?<br> Look at it. And not an hour ago,<br> you hadn't a penny to warm your pocket.<br> Did somebody die<br> and leave you a pot of gold?<br> - What are you saying that for?<br> - Well, did you rob a church or what?<br> - That's it.<br> - You...<br> You mean you robbed a church?<br> Ah, Gypo.<br> No. No, it wasn't a church.<br> It was a sailor,<br> off an American ship.<br> Shh! Not so loud.<br> I went through him behind Cassidy's pub<br> on Jerome Street. He was drunk.<br> But if you say a word of it<br> you'll get me into trouble.<br> Who, me?<br> What do you take me for?<br> An informer?<br> Why are you talking about informing?<br> Who's an informer?!<br> - Gypo!<br> - Don't be saying that.<br> What's the matter here?<br> What's the matter?<br> Oh, it's all right, Barney.<br> Let him alone.<br> He didn't mean any harm.<br> Come on. Let's get out of here.<br> Come on up to my room.<br> There's a nice warm fire there.<br> Here's your money.<br> You'll be all right.<br> Darling,<br> you don't want any more of that.<br> Let's get in the car.<br> I'll take you back...<br> Ah, no, Gypo.<br> Oh!<br> Gypo!<br> You gave him a pound note!<br> I forgot something.<br> They'll be wondering<br> why I'm not there already.<br> 'Tis the work of an informer.<br> 'Tis surely.<br> 'Tis the work of an informer.<br> Oh, Frankie!<br> Oh, Frankie!<br> Don't cry, Mother.<br> I'm sorry for your trouble,<br> Mrs. McPhillip.<br> What are you shouting for?<br> Don't you know there's a wake going on?<br> Ah, let him alone, Bartly.<br> Sure, he was a friend<br> of my dead boy's.<br> All the same, you should<br> show more respect for the dead.<br> Leave 'em alone!<br> Sure, I was only going<br> to give them back to you, Mr. Nolan.<br> I swear by all that's holy I warned him<br> to keep away from this house.<br> Good heavens, man,<br> there's no one suspects you.<br> Sure, that's right, Gypo.<br> No one suspects you.<br> You've been very good to me,<br> Mrs. McPhillip.<br> I'm sorry for your trouble.<br> Gypo! Gypo! Gypo!<br> - My life, what are you hurrying for?<br> - What makes you think I'm in a hurry?<br> Don't be getting your rag out, me boyo.<br> 'Tis a free country, and a man can ask<br> questions without all this gusting.<br> Especially from an old pal.<br> Are you working now?<br> No!<br> Don't be shouting at me<br> like an Aboriginal.<br> You can't blame us for taking a friendly<br> interest in you for old times' sake,<br> seeing as how you were<br> one of us at one time.<br> You don't seem to be<br> in any need of money tonight, Gypo.<br> Argh! Bartly!<br> What's wrong, boys?<br> What are you up to?<br> - He suspects me!<br> - Suspects you of what?<br> - I didn't say anything, Bartly...<br> - You're a liar! You did! Both of you.<br> And well I know you.<br> You're Gallagher's right-hand men...<br> Shut up, Gypo. Are you mad? Don't you<br> know there are people listening?<br> - Don't be accusing me, then.<br> - Let's get out of here.<br> - No.<br> - Gallagher wants to see you.<br> Well, I'm not going.<br> Come on, man!<br> He's not going to eat you.<br> Is it afraid of the commandant you are?<br> Afraid? I'm not afraid of the finest man<br> that was ever whipped!<br> Come on, man...<br> Keep your hands off me.<br> Come on.<br> Captain Mulholland, sir.<br> Gypo Nolan.<br> Well, Gypo.<br> You don't seem glad to see me.<br> You've got a grudge against me. Why?<br> Ah!<br> There isn't a thing I wouldn't do<br> for you, Dan Gallagher.<br> But you had me court-martialled<br> and expelled from the organisation.<br> You disobeyed orders,<br> endangered the organisation.<br> You had a fair trial, Gypo.<br> Only for me, you wouldn't have<br> got away as easy as you did.<br> There were others<br> who wanted to give you this.<br> Forget that.<br> We've got something on hand now<br> that's as much your business as ours.<br> Frankie McPhillip was your pal...<br> wasn't he?<br> I want your help, that's all.<br> This looks like<br> the job of an informer.<br> We have to get that informer,<br> understand?<br> If you don't help us with this job,<br> people might think...<br> It isn't that. It isn't that.<br> Look here, Commandant.<br> It's... it's how... it's how...<br> Oh, I don't know what I'm doing!<br> - What's the matter, Gypo?<br> - What's the matter?!<br> The last six months I've been starving,<br> that's what's the matter.<br> I've been living from hand to mouth<br> on whatever I could foray from sailors.<br> I got no clothes. I got no money.<br> I got nothing.<br> Look here, Gypo.<br> I'm going to make a fair deal with you.<br> Last October you put us all<br> in a very dangerous position.<br> We'll call it quits and reinstate you.<br> On one condition.<br> That you find the man<br> that's informed on Frankie McPhillip.<br> - Do you mean that?<br> - Indeed I do, Gypo.<br> Put it there, Danny, my boy.<br> Put it there.<br> What did I tell you?<br> What did I tell you, Bartly?<br> There isn't anything<br> I wouldn't do for you, Dan.<br> There isn't anything I wouldn't do.<br> Can we have a drink on that?<br> Let's have a little drink on that.<br> Have a drink<br> on the commandant, Tommy.<br> Bartly, my boy,<br> a little drink for you.<br> There.<br> Ah!<br> Ah, that's fine stuff.<br> It's good stuff, Bartly, eh?<br> Ahh!<br> Danny, there isn't anything<br> I wouldn't do for you.<br> There isn't anything.<br> Ah, it's nice to be friendly.<br> I'd go through fire and water for you.<br> Who informed on Frankie McPhillip?<br> I'll tell you.<br> It was that rat Mulligan.<br> - Mulligan?<br> - Mulligan, the tailor?<br> - As sure as you were born, it was him.<br> - How do you make that out?<br> I'll tell you, Commandant.<br> I didn't like to say it meself.<br> A man can't be too sure<br> about a thing like that.<br> But, as you said it yourself, Commandant,<br> in the way you put it...<br> Hurry up, man.<br> Make your statement.<br> Ah! That's fine stuff.<br> - How didn't I think of that before?<br> - Think of what?<br> - It... it was the grudge!<br> - What grudge?<br> Oh, the grudge. The grudge.<br> - Th-th-that Mulligan had on Frankie!<br> - About what?<br> Ah...<br> Ah, it's a long long story.<br> It's a long story.<br> There's another little drink<br> in the bottle.<br> Take it.<br> Man alive,<br> you've eradicated the bottle.<br> Ah, Tommy, Tommy.<br> Come on now, Gypo, out with it.<br> What grudge are you talking about?<br> - Do you remember his sister Suzy?<br> - Whose sister?<br> - Mulligan's.<br> - What has she got to do with it?<br> What has she got to do with it?!<br> Why shouldn't she have<br> something to do with it?<br> Wasn't she in trouble?<br> And wasn't Frankie<br> the boyo that was named?<br> I never heard that.<br> Well... well, it's true, anyway.<br> Well...<br> Here.<br> Figure that out for your...<br> figure that out for yourself.<br> That's why Mulligan informed.<br> That's why Mulligan informed.<br> Hey.<br> I saw him going to the Tan...<br> Tans' headquarters tonight.<br> - What time?<br> - What time?<br> Half past six.<br> Well?<br> Are you taking me back, then?<br> If your statement checks up,<br> you'll get back.<br> There's a court of inquiry at 1:30<br> at the ammunition dump. Be there.<br> Take him up.<br> Arrange to meet him somewhere.<br> Bartly, my boy,<br> you'll find me down at Katie Madden's.<br> Right.<br> I'll see you boys later.<br> - Bartly, my boy.<br> - Show him out.<br> It's him, Dan. I'd stake my life on it.<br> He's the one that did it.<br> - He's drunk.<br> - Drunk, is it?<br> It's a wonder he can walk at all.<br> Tell me, how has Mary taken it?<br> Her heart is dying inside of her,<br> Commandant, but you'd never know it.<br> She's waiting for you, Dan.<br> Look, it would be God's own mercy<br> for you to go and see her.<br> One thing is certain.<br> We must destroy that informer.<br> It may be Gypo,<br> but I don't believe it.<br> He was Frankie's friend<br> and had no motive.<br> Or it may be Mulligan,<br> though I doubt it again.<br> Whoever it was,<br> we've got to find them tonight.<br> One traitor can destroy an army.<br> It's his life against ours.<br> - You understand, Bartly?<br> - I do.<br> Keep at Gypo's heels like a pot of glue.<br> Find out all you can and bring him<br> to the ammunition dump at 1:30.<br> Find Captain Conlon. He's to mobilise<br> his company and round up Mulligan.<br> - I'll attend to the rest. Get started.<br> - Right.<br> Time! Time!<br> Come along, it's closing time.<br> Time now! You heard what he said.<br> Go on, off you go.<br> Gypo!<br> - Attaboy, Gypo!<br> - Stand up, man. Stand up.<br> Shake hands with<br> Gallagher's right hand.<br> Come on!<br> - What are you looking at me for?<br> - I'm not looking at you.<br> You're a liar.<br> You're a liar!<br> You can't just...<br> I can see you looking at me.<br> A cat can look at a king.<br> What are you talking about kings for?<br> Hear, hear.<br> Don't be talking about kings<br> around here.<br> You tell him, Gypo. That's the boy.<br> You'll be getting into trouble.<br> Ah, you're drunken!<br> Break it up. Break it up.<br> What do you think you're doing?<br> I saw you hit that man.<br> You've got no business hitting men like<br> that. You'll have to come to the station.<br> What a blow, Gypo.<br> What a blow.<br> Ah, will you look at the two of them.<br> Lying there sweet and peaceful<br> as the babes in the wood.<br> And, gentlemen,<br> there's the hand that rocked the cradle.<br> Me old Gypo!<br> Hurry!

Run!<br> So, you'll try and beat up a policeman,<br> will you?<br> Ah, let me go,<br> I had nothing to do with it at all.<br> I want to get me pipe and me hat!<br> I paid three shillings for that pipe.<br> Will you let me get back there<br> and get me pipe and me hat?<br> Ah, Gypo, me old son...<br> - Gentlemen. I have an announcement.<br> - Quiet, people.<br> With my own two eyes, I saw Gypo<br> knock Maloney flying across the road,<br> - like a man diving off the Bull Wall.<br> - Who is he?<br> Who is he? Who is he? He's Gypo Nolan,<br> and he's as strong as any bull.<br> - Hey, Gypo, am I right?<br> - Didn't you ever hear of him?<br> I tell you what this boyo is -<br> he's a king.<br> That's what he is. King Gypo.<br> Am I right?<br> Wasn't he pals with Frankie McPhillip who<br> was shot by the Black and Tans tonight?<br> Hey. When you mention the dead, you<br> add, "The Lord have mercy on his soul."<br> Unity, boys, now. Unity.<br> - Did you hear what he said?<br> - Aye.<br> "May the Lord have mercy<br> on his soul."<br> He died fighting for Ireland<br> to be free,<br> and every man here should do<br> the same thing.<br> And I'll do it when my time is called,<br> and so will King Gypo. So will King Gypo.<br> Am I right, Gypo, milord?<br> Right.<br> Silence! Quiet!<br> Silence here. Quiet, everybody.<br> Gypo, you have the floor.<br> I want ever...

But I'll see you<br> at one o'clock. You know where I mean.<br> Sure, my boy! Sure!<br> Oh, it's a fine night!<br> The finest night of my life!<br> Gypo!<br> That reminds me.<br> There's somebody waiting for me.<br> You know what I mean.<br> - Good night, all!<br> - Gypo! Gypo! Gypo!<br> Wait for me, you darling.<br> Wait for me. Wait for me.<br> Ah, Gypo, you have a sweet voice.<br> A sweet voice.<br> Listen.<br> Even the birds are still.<br> Where are you taking me to,<br> you little scut?<br> I have to get to Katie's.<br> Ah, there you go, there you go,<br> talking about Katie.<br> And we having a fine little jamboree.<br> Don't worry about your little Judy.<br> She'll be all right on the streets.<br> Hey!

A big lump of beef.<br> You're drunk,<br> and your last penny is spent,<br> and I have no further use for you,<br> Mr. Gypo Nolan.<br> Ipso facto.<br> And another thing.<br> Oh, be the holy...<br> Where did you get it, Gypo?<br> There's enough there to choke a horse.<br> And me joking about it<br> a few minutes ago.<br> Ah, Gypo, me boy, you're a king,<br> and the descendant of kings.<br> I'd fight for you,<br> and die for you when the time comes.<br> And there's me hand on it, Gypo.<br> The hand of a man that's loyal and true.<br> Am I right, Gypo?<br> Come on, you scut.<br> I'm going to find Katie!<br> Yes, and I'm the boy<br> to lead you to her.<br> Come on, she's a lovely girl, Gypo.<br> A lovely girl.<br> You should be proud of her.<br> You should be proud of her.<br> Come on, don't waste<br> the whole night on her.<br> - I tell you, it's not the place.<br> - Will you listen to the man?<br> Are you trying to insinuate that I'd lead<br> you astray, lead King Gypo astray? Never!<br> Up the barricades first!<br> Up the barricades and die like a man.<br> Ah. I don't know where I'm at.<br> Listen, you're in front of Aunt Betty's,<br> the finest shebeen in town,<br> and your little Katie is inside.<br> You hear her laughing and singing?<br> And they're playing the piano.<br> Open up!

Show him he can't intimidate us!<br> Up the rebels!<br> - What do you want?<br> - What does he want? What does he want?<br> Don't be disrespectful to me friend Gypo,<br> or you'll have me to settle with.<br> Ah, shut your gob!<br> And what do you mean,<br> breaking in here?<br> - I'm looking for Katie Madden.<br> - Well, you won't be finding her here.<br> Come on... Come back.<br> Come back, Gypo.<br> Come on back<br> and face them like a man.<br> Aw, get out! Get out! Throw 'em out!<br> Throw 'em out!

Get out before I throw you out!<br> Katie.<br> My name isn't Katie.<br> What is it you want?<br> That's what I'm asking.<br> What do you want?<br> What do you suppose,<br> you old harridan? A drink.<br> You'll get no drink here,<br> you... social climber!<br> - Go back to the gutter where you belong.<br> - Don't talk to Gypo and me like that.<br> And don't be looking down your nose,<br> either, you old squint.<br> I suppose you think we have no money?<br> Well, we have lashes of it.<br> Am I right, Gypo, or am I wrong? What did<br> I tell yous? He's as rich as Croesus.<br> Give everybody a drink.<br> I'm calling for drinks for the house.<br> - Glasses for everybody!<br> - Glasses for everybody!<br> Gypo!<br> Music! Music! Music for me old friend<br> and bosom companion!<br> Music for King Gypo!<br> And if there's anyone here thinks<br> he's a match with his fists,<br> kindly step up.<br> - Am I right, Gypo, or am I wrong?<br> - You're right. You're right.<br> Wait! Shut up!<br> Go to the devil, all of you!<br> There's more drink<br> where this came from.<br> - There's more where this came from.<br> - Get me more drink.<br> Gypo!<br> Stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it!<br> Do you want to get me<br> picked up by the police?<br> Hey. Hey.<br> I'll keep order for you.<br> Hey!<br> Who's making all the row?<br> The first one that opens his mouth above<br> a whisper... I'll crack his skull open.<br> - And he'd enjoy doing it.<br> - Yeah.<br> Gypo! Come on!<br> I'll teach you to behave<br> like a gentleman amongst ladies.<br> Hey.<br> Hey. 'Scuse me.<br> Can you play<br> "All Those Endearing Charms"?<br> "Believe Me If All Those<br> Endearing Young Charms".<br> - That's what I said!<br> - Do you hear? That's what he said.<br> The commandant<br> wants to see you.<br> - Oh, Dan!<br> - Mary, darling.<br> You shouldn't have come.<br> What if the Tans come back?<br> It's all right, dear.<br> My lads are outside.<br> Poor darling.<br> I know how you feel.<br> And there's nothing I can say or do<br> to help, except... well...<br> I wish it could have been me<br> instead of... Frankie.<br> If I lost you, I would only want to die.<br> Poor Mother.<br> Oh, Dan, when is this trouble<br> going to end, this...<br> this killing and more killing?<br> It's hard on you women, I know.<br> You're braver than we are.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry, dear.<br> - I love you, Mary.<br> I love you, Dan!<br> I must ask you some questions...<br> about Frankie.<br> May I?<br> Of course.<br> There must have been an informer,<br> you know that?<br> The man who knew about Frankie<br> knows enough to destroy us all.<br> The moment he's frightened,<br> he'll tell the Tans everything.<br> And they'll wipe us out.<br> I'm not thinking about myself.<br> It's the organisation. It's Ireland.<br> You know that, don't you?<br> I know that, dear.<br> I have to find that informer.<br> Did Frankie think he was followed<br> when he came home tonight?<br> He was sure he wasn't.<br> - Had he seen or spoken to anybody?<br> - Nobody.<br> Only his friend Gypo Nolan.<br> He had to ask him if there was<br> a guard on the house.<br> - Where?<br> - Let's see.<br> - The Dunboy House, I think he said.<br> - Mm. I see.<br> - Did he mention a man named Mulligan?<br> - No, I'm sure not.<br> We're holding a court of inquiry at 1:30.<br> Can you come? I need you.<br> If you need me, I'll come.<br> I'll come back for you<br> about one o'clock.<br> Can you slip out the back way?<br> Oh, Dan! Dan! What would I do<br> if anything happened to you?<br> Whatever happens to you<br> it happens to my own heart!<br> Dan!<br> Commandant, there's a patrol of Tans<br> in the neighbourhood. You'd better hurry.<br> I forgot something.<br> I gotta be going.<br> - Gypo!<br> - Gypo!<br> Oh, Gypo, come on back now<br> and I'll get you a nice drink.<br> And I'll sing you another song.<br> Come on.<br> How contemptible you are. You only<br> tolerate him because of his money.<br> - Watch what you're saying, my fine lady.<br> - I know you hate me.<br> Simply because I'm... I'm not coarse.<br> Simply because I'm...<br> No. I hate you because<br> you're stuck-up<br> and think you're better<br> than anybody else.<br> She does, too!<br> I had no right to come here.<br> I should have gone to the police.<br> Police? Oh, none of that talk.<br> Keep away from the police.<br> What do you want the police for?<br> I want to get back home.<br> Where's your home?<br> It's... it's near London.<br> Now, listen, Gypo, be very careful.<br> Don't do anything you'll regret, Gypo.<br> How much would it cost<br> to get back there?<br> There. There's your fare.<br> Five pounds!<br> What are you after doing, Gypo?<br> Now, don't be afraid. Now get outta here<br> and go home. Keep the money. Go on.<br> But... keep away from the police.<br> You're a good man. A good man.<br> Five pounds! On my immortal soul!<br> Gypo, do you know what...<br> That's all right, deary. But she owes me<br> four pounds for board and lodging.<br> Now, who's gonna pay me that?<br> Oh, shut your gob!<br> And not another word.<br> Now, listen, Gypo,<br> don't start this all over again...<br> Two and five is seven,<br> and four is eleven.<br> Eleven pounds.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen<br> the wonders of our generosity.<br> Money scattered like snuff<br> at a wake.<br> I want you to drink a health<br> to King Gypo,<br> as brave as a lion<br> and as strong as a bull.<br> I'd go through fire and water for him,<br> and he'd do the same for me.<br> From now on, from this night, wherever<br> you see one of us, you'll see the other.<br> Or vice versa, as the case may be.<br> - Am I right or am I wrong, Gypo?<br> - Right.<br> I ask you to drink<br> to the undying friendship...<br> Shut up!<br> And who, may I ask, has the impertinence<br> to tell me and Gypo to shut up?<br> Quiet!<br> Make way there. Make way!<br> Bartly, my boy!<br> - Come and have a drink.<br> - Come along, Gypo.<br> It's time to be going.<br> Ha-ha! Be off with you!<br> Who are you to be giving me orders?<br> Bash him, Gypo. Bash him. Who does<br> he think he is, giving orders to us?<br> I said shut up!<br> They're not my orders,<br> they're Gallagher's.<br> And you'd better be careful<br> about disobeying them.<br> You're right, Bartly.<br> Is it one o'clock?<br> It is.<br> I know who they are. Them's the<br> Republican Army. The Republican Army.<br> I'm no friend of Gypo.<br> He wormed his way into my confidence.<br> I'm a son of Erin, and I'd never<br> lift me hand against the crown.<br> Crown or no crown,<br> army or no army,<br> who's going to pay me<br> for that last round of drinks?<br> Come on, Gypo. Let's go.<br> You ought to be thrown into the Liffey,<br> you old hag!<br> For serving liquor after hours,<br> and on the holy day of obligation.<br> Not so fast, you little snake.<br> You can pay for the drinks yourself.<br> Now, listen, Aunt Betty.<br> You're a lovely, quiet,<br> decent little woman.<br> Give me till tomorrow<br> till I raise the wind.<br> Tomorrow, is it?<br> McCabe! McCabe!<br> Oh dear, oh dear.<br> I have a queer feeling<br> there's going to be a strange<br> face in heaven in the morning.<br> Gypo!<br> Katie. Katie.<br> I've been looking all over for you.<br> Where have you been?<br> I was in my digs. I waited for you.<br> Why didn't you come?<br> What's wrong, Gypo?<br> Where are they taking you?<br> Ah, Katie, it's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> Don't you worry.<br> Gallagher's taking me back.<br> - Ah, shut up! Come on.<br> - Shut up, Gypo. Let's get out of here.<br> - Wait... Wait...<br> - Let's get out of here.<br> Will you stop?<br> Keep your hands off me, will you?<br> Hey. Do you remember the 20 pounds<br> I was talking about?<br> The 20 pounds?<br> I got it. I got it for you.<br> I got it for you.<br> - Come on!<br> - You've had enough talk.<br> Come on, Gypo.<br> Gypo!<br> All right, sir.<br> Attention!<br> Our case is prepared, gentlemen.<br> Watch out below!<br> Let me alone, will you?<br> Hello, boys! Here I am!<br> And I can fight the best six men<br> that ever walked the earth. Come on.<br> Danny... Danny, me boy. Ha-ha!<br> Am I right? You and me,<br> we can put 'em in the ground. Come on.<br> What's the matter<br> with your eye, Bartly?<br> He got me riled.<br> I gave him a backhander.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Come on.<br> Give me my hat, will you?<br> There's my hat.<br> Bartly, me boy!<br> Bartly, me boy!<br> Mulligan.<br> What brings you here?<br> Man alive, you ought to be in bed.<br> This is no hour<br> for a sick man to be out.<br> Dan, I...<br> Listen, men.<br> I had a drop taken before I came here,<br> and I didn't know what I was saying.<br> But... now I remember.<br> That's the one that<br> informed on Frankie McPhillip.<br> - I saw him and he knows it.<br> - It's a lie! It's a lie!<br> I swear, I never left the house except<br> to go to the chapel to say my prayers.<br> Ha-ha-ha, me fine boyo!<br> It's easy work for an informer<br> to be swearing oaths.<br> It's a lie! It's a lie!<br> Sit down, Gypo.<br> Sit down.<br> Peter Mulligan, do you recognise<br> the authority of this court?<br> I do. I do, Commandant.<br> Heaven knows I do.<br> Stand here and give the court an account<br> of your whereabouts from noon today.<br> Could you find no better man to carry off<br> in the middle of the night than me,<br> that's having to work my hands off<br> a- stitching in a basement so cold and<br> damp that I've caught me death of cold?<br> I'm sorry, Mulligan, start at noon.<br> Where were you?<br> At noon today<br> I was lying in my bed.<br> I had a pain in my side from bronchitis<br> all morning and I had to stay in my bed.<br> Then, at one o'clock, the old woman<br> gave me a cup of tea and an egg.<br> I remember I couldn't eat the egg -<br> a good egg, too.<br> But good or bad, no matter.<br> I had to get up then on account of a suit<br> that had to be finished for Mick Foley.<br> It's got to be ready by Friday.<br> His daughter's getting married...<br> Never mind Foley.<br> Tell us about yourself.<br> There y'are. There y'are.<br> Hear what he said?<br> Come on, Mulligan.<br> Make a clean breast of it.<br> It's not for me to condemn you, Gypo.<br> Maybe you're not responsible.<br> Why, blast you!<br> What are you driving at?<br> Sit down, Gypo, and keep quiet.<br> - Do you think?<br> - Sit down.<br> - Bartly, me boy.<br> - Shut up!<br> Continue, Mulligan.<br> Well, I worked on till<br> about half past three<br> or maybe a quarter to four,<br> when Charlie Corrigan came in and said<br> his brother Dave was just out of prison.<br> "Where is he?"<br> "He's upstairs", says he.<br> We went up and we talked over<br> a cup of tea till about six o'clock -<br> yes, it was just six - I remember<br> I heard the Angelus beginning to strike<br> on my way down the stairs, because<br> I remember I stopped to cross myself.<br> Then I ran down home and put on my<br> overcoat - this one, second-hand it is -<br> and I went to the chapel to...<br> I'm making the Stations of the Cross.<br> - How far is the chapel from your house?<br> - It's maybe 100 yards, maybe it's more.<br> If you go around by King's, it's less,<br> but if you go the long way around...<br> Let's say it's 100 yards. You arrived at<br> the chapel about three minutes past six.<br> - How long did you stay?<br> - I stayed till about half past six,<br> and then I stayed outside talking to<br> Father Conroy for about ten minutes...<br> - Anyone else?<br> - I was coming to that.<br> Then, after I left Father Conroy,<br> I met Barney Kerrigan there...<br> Near the chapel?<br> Yes, it must be within 50 yards of it<br> if you're going by measurements...<br> Never mind. You couldn't have been near<br> the Black and Tans' headquarters at six?<br> Heaven forbid.<br> I hope to die right here if I was.<br> - You liar! You liar!<br> - Sit down!<br> - Liar, Bartly!<br> - Shut up!<br> What did you do<br> after you left Kerrigan?<br> I went back to the house<br> and did a bit more work till about eight.<br> Then I felt the pain in my side again<br> and I went to my bed.<br> Till three men, under Mr. Tom Connor<br> there, came in and bundled me into a cab<br> without a by-your-leave,<br> as if I was a criminal.<br> One more question.<br> Do you bear anyone a grievance -<br> about your sister Suzy, I mean?<br> My sister Suzy, is it?<br> Sure, my sister Suzy's name<br> is Mary Ellen.<br> For 28 years she's been living in Boston.<br> She's the mother of eight children.<br> - That's enough.<br> - It is that.<br> - Did you bear any man a grudge?<br> - I bear no man a grudge, on me oath.<br> No grievance against<br> Frankie McPhillip?<br> The Lord have mercy on his soul.<br> What for?<br> I hope his sorrows are over him.<br> I swear on my immortal soul,<br> Miss McPhillip,<br> I bore no grudge<br> against your brother.<br> Kerrigan, did you meet Peter Mulligan<br> at about half past six this evening?<br> - I did.<br> - Are you sure about the time?<br> I'm certain.<br> It was just about half six. I was...<br> - As you were.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Bartly, Bartly, Bartly. I...<br> You will be taken home in the car<br> that brought you here.<br> I'm sorry this had to happen.<br> For now, this may help you.<br> We'll see what can be done for you later.<br> Good night, Mulligan.<br> Show him out, Kerrigan.<br> Hey! Hey! Wait a minute.<br> He did it!<br> Now, Gypo, tell us<br> what you did with your time<br> from six o'clock this evening<br> until Mulholland picked you up at one.<br> - What's it to do with you where I was?<br> - Tell us what you did<br> after meeting Frankie McPhillip<br> at the Dunboy House at six.<br> It's a lie!<br> I'm sorry, Mary, repeat what Frankie<br> told you when he came home tonight.<br> He said that he met him<br> at the Dunboy House.<br> He said he had to make sure<br> there was no guard on our home.<br> Is that true, Gypo?<br> If not, why did you say at the wake<br> that you warned him to stay away?<br> That's it. That's what I told him.<br> You did see him! Why did you<br> tell those lies about Mulligan?<br> Were you drunk or what?<br> Well, I... I...<br> I'd taken me a drop.<br> Maybe two. I...<br> What did you do after leaving Frankie?<br> Tell me.<br> What did you do<br> after leaving Frankie?!<br> Well, it was...<br> Suppose I don't tell you.<br> What will you do?<br> Suit yourself.<br> If you don't want to tell me,<br> Bartly Mulholland here<br> can do it for you.<br> - Come on. Better tell us.<br> - Ah.<br> I...<br> I- I-I-I-I'm all mixed up.<br> I-I don't know what I'm doing.<br> I was... I'm drunk. I...<br> Dan, I...<br> I don't know what I'm doing, that's all.<br> I don't know what I'm doing.<br> Where did you get<br> the money you spent?<br> I can't make nothing out, Dan.<br> I'm drunk.<br> You broke your first pound in Ryan's. The<br> blind man says you gave him a pound.<br> He did, he did, the poor man.<br> A pound note, he gave me.<br> Two pounds<br> you spent on fish and chips.<br> Two pounds went for drinks in the<br> shebeen, where Mulholland found you.<br> Five pounds you gave to some woman.<br> Four pounds you gave to another woman,<br> known as Aunt Betty.<br> And finally, you gave five pounds<br> to Katie Madden.<br> That makes just 20 pounds.<br> - Ah, me head is sore, Dan. I'm drunk...<br> - Where did you get that 20 pounds?!<br> I can't remember.<br> I can't remember, Dan.<br> Confess, man. Ease your soul.<br> Who was the informer?<br> I didn't know what I was doing, Dan.<br> I didn't know what I was doing, Dan.<br> I didn't know what I was doing.<br> You can see what I mean.<br> Bartly! Boys!<br> Isn't there a man here<br> that can tell me why I did it?<br> Me head is sore. I can't tell him.<br> I-I can't tell him. I can't tell him.<br> I... I don't know why I did it.<br> I don't know why I did it.<br> - Dan!<br> - No. Lock him up.<br> - Come on, Gypo. Come on. Come on.<br> - I don't know why I did it...<br> Bartly, I didn't know<br> what I was doing. I...<br> Oh, the Lord have mercy on him.<br> I'm sorry you had to see this.<br> Why must we be killing one another?<br> What good will it do?<br> Oh, why can't we have peace?<br> - Have mercy on us all.<br> - It's all over now, dear.<br> I'll take you home in just a moment. It's<br> not a matter of revenge.

Tell me you'll<br> give him a chance!<br> There's no harm in him.<br> He didn't know what he was doing!<br> Miss McPhillip, for the sake of your own<br> love, ask him to give my man a chance.<br> Katie, Katie. This is no time<br> for sentiment. This is war!<br> I tell you, I gave Gypo the benefit<br> of every doubt, every chance.<br> He confessed. I didn't<br> pass sentence on him, the court did.<br> Don't you see how helpless I am?<br> Suppose it was his life<br> you were begging for!<br> It is mine, and the lives<br> of hundreds of other men.<br> Can't you see what you're asking?<br> I see you won't do it!<br> You won't!<br> Come on, now, Dennis. It was<br> you that drew the match. Don't be afraid.<br> I'm not afraid.<br> Are you sure he's in there?<br> The door is locked.<br> 'Tis locked, I tell you.<br> Katie! Katie!<br> - I'll bl... I'll blow the lock off.<br> - Yes. Sure, now. That's an idea. Go on.<br> Mother of God!<br> Bartly!<br> Gypo!<br> Gypo!<br> 'Twas I informed on your son,<br> Mrs. McPhillip.<br> Forgive me.<br> Ah, Gypo.
