You can go up now.<br> Sorry. I'm accepting<br> an award...<br> from the Retinitis<br> Pigmentosa Foundation.<br> It's gonna kill<br> the rest of my day.<br> So, have you had a chance<br> to play golf?<br> Jeff's a premier golfer.<br> What are you, a two handicap?<br> - Seven.<br> - And he gets out there...<br> and he has<br> five strokes on us.<br> He has more concentration<br> than anybody I've ever met.<br> It's spooky<br> how he can concentrate.<br> I'd rather play<br> than talk about it.<br> What did you<br> want to see me about?<br> I don't like<br> being back here.<br> Jeffrey says exactly<br> what's on his mind.<br> Most people consider<br> what they're saying... social skills.<br> Jeffrey just charges<br> right ahead.<br> Now, I know you understood the nature<br> of the confidentiality portion...<br> of your severance agreement<br> with Brown & Williamson.<br> - Chapter and verse.<br> - Yeah, I know you do.<br> You know, I came up<br> through sales.<br> One of the reasons<br> I was a great salesman...<br> was I never made a promise<br> I couldn't keep.<br> I knew that if I ever<br> broke my promise,<br> I'd suffer<br> the consequence.<br> Is that a threat?<br> We worked together for...<br> what was it, three years?<br> Now, the work we did here is<br> confidential, not for public scrutiny...<br> any more than<br> are one's family matters.<br> You're threatening<br> my family now too?<br> Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.<br> About the direction of research here,<br> we may have had our differences, but...<br> Research. You declare<br> as a badge of honor you don't<br> even know what makes water boil.<br> Well, that's why<br> we hire scientists.<br> Okay.<br> I don't believe that you can<br> maintain corporate integrity...<br> without<br> confidentiality agreements.<br> I was paid well<br> for my work,<br> the health and welfare<br> benefits are good,<br> the severance package<br> is fair.<br> I have no intention of violating<br> my confidentiality agreement...<br> and disclosing that<br> which I said I wouldn't.<br> I appreciate<br> all that, Jeff,<br> but upon reflection, we've decided<br> to expand our zone of comfort with you,<br> so we've drafted a supplement<br> to your agreement.<br> It broadly defines and<br> expands in more detail...<br> what is confidential.<br> Nobody will be able<br> to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret,<br> I didn't know that<br> was a secret."<br> We're very serious<br> about protecting our interests.<br> We'd like you<br> to sign it.<br> And if I don't?<br> If we arrive at the conclusion<br> that you're acting in bad faith,<br> we would terminate right now<br> payoffs under your severance package,<br> you and your family's medical<br> benefits and initiate litigation<br> against you, Mr. Wigand.<br> - Dr. Wigand.<br> - Dr. Wigand.<br> If you've examined the document, you'll<br> see it's in your own best interest...<br> and you'll sign it.<br> What you're saying is it isn't enough<br> that you fired me for no good reason.<br> Now you question<br> my integrity?<br> On top of the humiliation<br> of being fired, you threaten me,<br> you threaten<br> my family.<br> It never crossed my mind<br> not to honor my agreement.<br> I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur...<br> and Brown & Williamson too...<br> Fuck me?<br> Well, fuck you!<br> I'm not sure<br> he got the message.<br> Oh, I think he did.<br> - Yeah.<br> - You fucked me!<br> - Who's this?<br> - Protect your sources?<br> You screwed me.<br> You sold me out.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Where are you?<br> - Fuck you too!<br> Stay away from me.<br> You stay away from me!<br> Jeffrey, you forgot<br> the lunches!<br> - Mrs. Wigand?<br> - Jump in quick. Come on.<br> How do you do? I'm Lowell Bergman.<br> We spoke on the phone.<br> - Come here. I want to talk to you.<br> - Good. I want to talk to you.<br> - This is my house.<br> In front of my wife, my kids?<br> - I did not burn you.<br> I did not give you up<br> to anyone.<br> - What business do we have?<br> - I'm here to straighten<br> something out with you.<br> Right here, right now.<br> You haven't mentioned my name?<br> You haven't talked to anybody about me?<br> - What am I gonna mention your name for?<br> - Why are Brown & Williamson...<br> How the hell do I know about<br> Brown & Williamson?<br> It happened just after I talked to you.<br> I do not like coincidences.<br> Well, I don't like paranoid accusations.<br> I'm a journalist.<br> Think. Use your head.<br> How do I operate as a journalist?<br> By screwing the people...<br> who could provide me with information<br> before they provided me with it?<br> - You came all the way<br> down here to tell me that?<br> - No, I did not.<br> Big Tobacco<br> is a big story,<br> and you got something<br> important to say. I can tell.<br> But yes, I did. I came all<br> the way down here to tell you...<br> Story, no story...<br> fuck your story.<br> I don't burn people.<br> Ride with me while I<br> take the girls to school.<br> My little girl has acute asthma.<br> Deborah, my oldest daughter.<br> And I'm unemployed, so I have<br> to protect my medical coverage.<br> So I left them a message<br> this morning. Their expanded<br> confidentiality agreement...<br> I will sign it.<br> - They're afraid of you, aren't they?<br> - They should be.<br> Talk to me outside the zone<br> of your agreement.<br> - Like what?<br> - Like, uh, where'd you work<br> before Brown & Williamson?<br> Johnson &Johnson.<br> Union Carbide in Japan.<br> I was the general manager and director<br> of new products. I speak Japanese.<br> I was a director<br> of corporate development at Pfizer.<br> All health-related.<br> What else<br> outside the zone?<br> I don't know. Do you think the Knicks<br> are gonna make it to the semifinals?<br> - Just give me an example.<br> - Okay.<br> For example, um,<br> James Burke.<br> - C.E.O. Of Johnson &Johnson.<br> - Yeah.<br> When he found out that some lunatic<br> had put poison in Tylenol bottles,<br> he didn't argue<br> with the F.D.A.<br> He didn't even wait for the F.D.A.<br> To tell him. He just pulled Tylenol...<br> off every shelf of every store<br> right across America, instantly.<br> And then he developed a safety cap.<br> Because as a C.E.O., sure, he's<br> gotta be a great businessman, right?<br> But he's also<br> a man of science.<br> He's not gonna allow his company<br> to put on the shelf a product<br> that might hurt people.<br> Not like<br> the Seven Dwarfs.<br> - Seven Dwarfs?<br> - Seven C.E.O. S of Big Tobacco.<br> They got in front of Congress<br> that time. It was on television.<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Swore under oath that<br> they know nothing about addiction...<br> It was on C-SPAN.<br> Yeah.<br> Okay, so, here you are.<br> You-You-You go to work for tobacco.<br> You come from corporate cultures<br> where research...<br> really creative thinking...<br> these are core values.<br> You go to tobacco.<br> Tobacco is a sales culture...<br> market and sell enormous volume,<br> go to a lot of golf tournaments.<br> The hell with everything else.<br> What are you doing?<br> - Why are you working<br> for tobacco in the first place?<br> - I can't talk about it.<br> The work I was supposed to do...<br> might have had some positive effect,<br> I don't know.<br> Could have been beneficial.<br> Mostly, I got paid a lot.<br> I took the money.<br> My wife was happy.<br> My kids had good medical,<br> good schools. Got a great house.<br> I mean, what the hell<br> is wrong with that?<br> Nothing's wrong with that. That's it.<br> You're making money.<br> You're providing for your family.<br> What could be wrong with that?<br> I always thought of myself as a man of<br> science, that's what's wrong with it.<br> Then you're in<br> a state of conflict, Jeff.<br> Because look,<br> here's how it lays out.<br> If you've got vital<br> insider stuff,<br> the American people, for their<br> welfare, really do need to know,<br> and you feel impelled<br> to disclose it...<br> and violate your agreement<br> in doing so, that's one thing.<br> On the other hand, if you want<br> to honor this agreement,<br> then that's simple...<br> you do so.<br> You say nothing,<br> you do nothing.<br> There's only one guy<br> who can figure that out for you,<br> and that's you<br> all by yourself.<br> I gotta go pick up the girls.<br> They only had a half a day.<br> I've heard virtually<br> all the... We touched on it...<br> - Yes or no, do you believe<br> nicotine is not addictive?<br> - Congressman,<br> cigarettes and nicotine clearly<br> do not meet the classic<br> definitions of addiction.<br> - There is no intoxication.<br> - We'll take that as no.<br> Again, time is short.<br> I think each of you believe<br> nicotine is not addictive...<br> and just would like to<br> have this for the record.<br> I believe that nicotine<br> is not addictive.<br> I too believe<br> that nicotine...<br> He referred to this...<br> the Seven Dwarfs...<br> - What Seven Dwarfs?<br> - The seven C.E.O. Of Big Tobacco...<br> referred to this.<br> Said they should be afraid of him.<br> I assume afraid of what he could reveal.<br> Now you tell me. What does this guy<br> have to say that threatens these people?<br> Well, it isn't cigarettes<br> are bad for you.<br> - Hardly new news.<br> - No shit.<br> - What's this?<br> - What that is is tobacco's<br> standard defense.<br> It's the "we don't know"<br> litany.<br> Addiction? We believe not.<br> Disease? We don't know.<br> We take a bunch of leaves,<br> we roll them together, you smoke 'em.<br> After that, you're on your own.<br> We don't know.<br> So, that<br> tells me nothing.<br> - Besides, you'll never get<br> what he's got.<br> - Why not?<br> Because of this guy's<br> confidentiality agreement,<br> he's never gonna be able<br> to talk to you.<br> That's not good enough.<br> This guy is the top scientist...<br> in the number-three<br> tobacco company in America.<br> He's a corporate officer.<br> You never get whistle-blowers<br> from Fortune 500 companies.<br> This guy is<br> the ultimate insider.<br> He's got something to say. He wants<br> to say it. I want it on 60 Minutes.<br> Doesn't matter what he wants.<br> Am I missing something here?<br> - What do you mean, Mike?<br> - He's got a corporate secrecy agreement.<br> Give me a break.<br> This is a public health issue, like an<br> unsafe air frame on a passenger jet...<br> or some company dumping cyanide<br> into the East River.<br> Issues like that.<br> He can talk, we can air it.<br> They've got no right to hide behind<br> a corporate agreement. Pass the milk.<br> They don't need the right.<br> They got the money.<br> The unlimited checkbook.<br> That's how Big Tobacco wins...<br> every time<br> on everything.<br> They spend you to death.<br> $600 million a year in outside legal.<br> Chadbourne-Park, Ken Starr's firm,<br> Kirkland and Ellis.<br> Listen, G.M. And Ford,<br> they get nailed...<br> after 11 or 12 pickups<br> blow up, right?<br> - These clowns have never... I mean ever...<br> - Not even once.<br> Not even with hundreds of thousands<br> dying each year from an illness...<br> related to their product have ever<br> lost a personal injury lawsuit.<br> On this case, they'll issue gag orders,<br> sue for breach... anticipatory breach...<br> enjoin him, you, us,<br> his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian,<br> tie 'em up in litigation for ten<br> or 15 years, I'm telling you,<br> they bat a thousand.<br> Every time. He knows that.<br> That's why he's not gonna talk to you.<br> Okay, let's look through<br> the looking glass the other way.<br> What do you mean?<br> We got a guy who wants to talk,<br> but he's constrained.<br> - What if he were compelled to talk?<br> - Oh, torture. Great ratings.<br> What do you mean, "compelled"?<br> I mean, compelled<br> by a, uh, Justice Department.<br> State courts.<br> Be a witness.<br> That would cut through any<br> confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?<br> - What does that do?<br> - What do you mean, what does it do?<br> What I mean is like, how does it cut<br> through the confidentiality agreement?<br> Because he has to, uh,<br> reveal it in a court of law.<br> It's on record. It's out.<br> It's no secret anymore.<br> So how can they restrain his speech<br> or retaliate? It's out in the world.<br> If you could engineer it into the<br> court record, you might have something.<br> They would have a hell of a time<br> trying to restrain his speech<br> then, wouldn't they?<br> Yeah, but what venue? And where does<br> he get... Does he have killer attorneys?<br> I don't think he's got<br> any attorneys.<br> He's gonna need attorneys who aren't<br> afraid of risking years of litigation...<br> and millions of dollars<br> of their own dough in legal costs.<br> What do you say, Mike?<br> What do you think?<br> Even if he gets<br> the defense team,<br> will he go for it?<br> You're awfully<br> overqualified, Dr. Wigand.<br> I'm trying to start<br> a new career.<br> I believe I could be<br> a good teacher.<br> Let me give it<br> some thought.<br> And not a lot of companies in the health<br> care field hire ex-tobacco scientists.<br> That's it.<br> It's where<br> our babies were born.<br> Debbie took her first steps<br> right there on...<br> In the grass.<br> - I didn't plan on this.<br> - Hey, hey, hey.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> We can make this<br> work for us. Okay?<br> It's just...<br> It's not...<br> It's just...<br> It's a smaller scale.<br> Simpler, easier.<br> More time.<br> More time together.<br> More time<br> with the kids.<br> More time for us.<br> Okay? It's just...<br> Can you imagine me<br> coming home from some job...<br> feeling good<br> at the end of the day?<br> This is gonna be better.<br> This is gonna be better.<br> Love your home<br> with beautiful Broyhill furniture...<br> You'll find incredible<br> sale prices throughout Smith's<br> Broyhill showcase gallery,<br> with extra savings on every style<br> for every room in your home.<br> If you've been putting off<br> decorating that special room,<br> now's the time to act during the<br> love-your-home sale at Smith's.<br> - Back to...<br> - Welcome back.<br> Hey, baby.<br> What's wrong?<br> Who's that outside,<br> Daddy?<br> - Did you see somebody<br> or did you hear them?<br> - I heard him.<br> - Where?<br> - In the backyard.<br> Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?<br> Why don't you sit up at the desk.<br> All right?<br> Get out some paper,<br> and draw me a picture. Okay?<br> What are you gonna draw me, baby?<br> An animal? Something like that?<br> You stay down here until Daddy<br> gets back, all right, Barbara?<br> You stay down here.<br> You almost got<br> your damn head blown off.<br> Daddy!<br> It was just a raccoon, baby.<br> Nothin'.<br> They're nocturnal.<br> You know what that means?<br> That means that they<br> only come out at nighttime.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.<br> Is it too late?<br> No, no, it's okay. I...<br> How-How's the new place?<br> The new place?<br> New.<br> - You okay?<br> - Sure.<br> I was thinking of<br> calling you tomorrow anyway.<br> - Uh, how's your kids,<br> uh, handling the new house?<br> - Good.<br> - You got kids?<br> - We have a couple.<br> One's hers, one's mine.<br> Everybody uses a different name.<br> Modern marriage.<br> Uh, how's Liane?<br> Uh, she's okay. Uh...<br> Hold on a minute.<br> Lowell.<br> Somebody may be following me. I-I don't<br> know. They came on the property.<br> What do you mean, following you?<br> Did you call the police?<br> I-I don't wanna be paranoid.<br> I mean...<br> - Maybe it's a game.<br> Some kind of mind game.<br> - What do you really think?<br> I don't know what the fuck<br> I really think.<br> Are they doing it?<br> Is some crank doing it?<br> Are they doing it<br> to make me feel paranoid?<br> Are they doing it for real and don't<br> give a shit what I think? I don't know.<br> - I don't fuckin' know.<br> - Jeffrey, describe for me...<br> in detail what happened.<br> Well...<br> No. Look, I mean, there was<br> a footprint. Forget it.<br> It's probably<br> not important at all.<br> You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching<br> high school. Japanese and Chemistry.<br> Uh, so, uh, what were you<br> calling about?<br> - You called me.<br> - No, you said you were gonna<br> call me tomorrow.<br> - So, what about?<br> - Oh, yes, yes, yes. I did.<br> I wanted to talk to you.<br> I wanted to hook up with you,<br> talk to you about what we were<br> talking about in your car.<br> Okay.<br> It makes you feel good,<br> putting what you know to use?<br> - How'd you know that, Lowell?<br> - It's obvious, isn't it?<br> Hello?<br> Are you there?<br> Yeah.<br> Look, um...<br> Thanks for talking.<br> I'm sorry I woke you up.<br> - I didn't know.<br> - It's okay.<br> Lowell.<br> Who is this?<br> Do not call here!<br> Do not...<br> What are you<br> gonna get us?<br> Tempura.<br> The Internet said you did<br> graduate work at Wisconsin,<br> then went to U.C. La Jolla<br> with Professor Herbert?<br> - Marcus...<br> - Marcuse. Yeah.<br> He was my mentor.<br> He had a major influence<br> on the New Left in the late '60s.<br> And on me, personally.<br> - Next to your father?<br> - My father?<br> What the hell's that got<br> to do with my father?<br> I, uh...<br> Is that why you became a journalist?<br> Then you get to ask all the questions?<br> You charge by the hour?<br> My father was a...<br> A mechanical engineer.<br> Most ingenious man<br> I ever knew.<br> My father left us<br> when I was five years old.<br> He was not the most ingenious man<br> I ever knew.<br> Let's get back to Brown & Williamson.<br> If you decide to go on 60 Minutes,<br> I gotta know everything<br> about why you were fired.<br> - Why?<br> - They're gonna dig up<br> stuff from your past.<br> They're gonna throw it at you.<br> I gotta know what they're gonna throw.<br> You understand?<br> I drink.<br> - Couple of occasions<br> more than I should have.<br> - Um-hmm.<br> I was cited for shoplifting<br> once, but it was a mistake.<br> Pushed Liane one time. We were both<br> stressed out because of the pressure.<br> She went to her mother's.<br> I got, uh, fired,<br> because, uh,<br> when I get angry, I have<br> difficulty censoring myself,<br> and I don't like<br> to be pushed around.<br> I'm not pushing you around.<br> I'm asking you questions.<br> I'm just a commodity<br> to you, aren't I?<br> I could be anything, right? Anything<br> worth putting on between commercials.<br> To a network, probably,<br> we're all commodities.<br> To me, you're not a commodity.<br> What you are is important.<br> You go public, and 30 million people<br> hear what you gotta say,<br> nothing... I mean nothing...<br> will ever be the same again.<br> - You believe that?<br> - No.<br> You should. Because when<br> you're done the judgment...<br> is gonna go down in the court<br> of public opinion, my friend.<br> And that's...<br> the power you have.<br> - You believe that?<br> - I believe that?<br> - Yes, I believe that.<br> - You believe that...<br> - because you get information out<br> to people, something happens?<br> - Yes.<br> Maybe that's just what you've been<br> telling yourself all these years...<br> to justify having a good job.<br> Having status.<br> Maybe for the audience<br> it's just voyeurism, something<br> to do on a Sunday night.<br> Maybe it won't<br> change a fuckin' thing,<br> and people like myself<br> and my family...<br> are left hung out to dry,<br> used up, broke, alone.<br> Are you talking to me, or did somebody<br> else just walk in here? I never...<br> Don't evade a choice you gotta make<br> by questioning my reputation...<br> or 60 Minutes<br> with this cheap skepticism.<br> I have to put my family's welfare<br> on the line here, my friend.<br> - What are you putting up?<br> You're putting up words.<br> - "Words."<br> While you've been dicking around some<br> fucking company golf tournaments,<br> I've been out in the world<br> givin' my word...<br> and backing it up<br> with action.<br> Now, are you gonna go<br> and do this thing or not?<br> I said I'd call the kids<br> before they went to bed.<br> Stringer was supposed to be shooting<br> B- roll on street cops in New Orleans.<br> - What's with all the horses?<br> - Camera guy's got<br> a thing about mounted police.<br> Don't any of these guys<br> ride in cars? Walk?<br> - How long are these things?<br> - What was he saying?<br> Hello. Yes, I'm trying<br> to reach Mr. Richard Scruggs.<br> This is Richard Scruggs.<br> Can you hold on<br> a second, please?<br> Lowell, got him<br> on the phone.<br> - Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.<br> - Hold on.<br> Mobile Approach, this is<br> Leo-November-643. Over.<br> Request a flight level<br> of 220...<br> on a heading<br> of 284 degrees. Over.<br> - Mr. Bergman?<br> - Yes, I'm right here.<br> - Could you call me back on a hard line?<br> - All right.<br> - Area code 212-555-0199.<br> - I'll call you then.<br> What do we do with that?<br> I don't know.<br> Richard Scruggs.<br> You filed a lawsuit against tobacco<br> on behalf of the state of Mississippi.<br> - Did you not?<br> - That's right.<br> I'm working with someone now<br> who's the former head of<br> research at Brown & Williamson.<br> Former corporate officer there.<br> What's your interest<br> in this, Mr. Bergman?<br> Well, he may tape<br> an interview with us,<br> and we believe if his testimony<br> showed up in a court record first,<br> it would free him up from his<br> confidentiality agreement<br> and give him some protection.<br> It could work. If it's public record,<br> it's public record.<br> Yeah, and he's gonna need<br> legal representation.<br> He sure as hell will.<br> Has he decided<br> to go public?<br> Because let me tell ya.<br> We been doin' this for three years now,<br> and we've worked with a lot of corporate<br> cases involving whistle-blowers.<br> So we know Big Tobacco will do<br> everything in their power to stop him.<br> So is your man<br> truly committed?<br> Well, actually, no... Well, he's<br> on the fence. That's the point.<br> Well, we'd certainly be interested<br> in making his acquaintance.<br> But without knowing<br> what he's gonna do...<br> Would you want him to call you, or you<br> wanna call him? How do you wanna do it?<br> It would be better<br> if he called us.<br> - Yeah. Okay.<br> - All right?<br> Okay. Thank you.<br> Shit.<br> We need cops on the streets.<br> We don't need them on horses.<br> - I don't know what he was thinking.<br> - For God's sake.<br> - This guy got a horse fetish?<br> - All right, all right.<br> Get me, uh...<br> Get me to New Orleans this afternoon.<br> I'll shoot<br> the fucking thing myself!<br> - Have a good one.<br> - All right.<br> What are you cooking?<br> - I'm cooking pasta primavera.<br> - Oh, I love that stuff.<br> I'm going to<br> have to go downstairs.<br> Jeffrey!<br> Jeffrey! Jeffrey!<br> Jeffrey! Jeffrey!<br> - What happened?<br> - Dispatcher received a call<br> of shots fired in the area.<br> Uniforms arrived on the scene, found<br> this white male subject shot to death.<br> - Was it gang related?<br> - There's no indication...<br> as far as a tag or an advertisement.<br> Yeah.<br> They're terrorizing us.<br> Death threats. My family, my kids.<br> Whoa. What are you<br> talking about?<br> - Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.<br> - Jeff, call the F.B.I.<br> - Right away.<br> - They do this with impunity.<br> - Jeff...<br> - They get to go home at night.<br> What does it cost these people<br> to do this to us? Nothing!<br> My girls are crying.<br> So fuck them.<br> - I wanna tape. I'm done...<br> - I heard you.<br> I gotta arrange<br> for a legal defense first.<br> I gotta get you to testify in court,<br> get it on public record.<br> Then hold it off the air until you<br> got that, but I wanna go to New York,<br> and I wanna go on the record...<br> right now.<br> - Good. But, Jeff...<br> - I'll call them, Lowell.<br> Did you handle the round,<br> Mr. Wigand?<br> Yes, I'm afraid I did.<br> We won't be able to lift<br> usable prints.<br> Do you own a gun,<br> Mr. Wigand?<br> - A gun? Yes.<br> - What caliber is your gun?<br> What caliber is my gun?<br> Yes, sir.<br> What caliber is your gun?<br> What does that have to do<br> with the price of tea in China?<br> You think I put the bullet<br> in the mailbox myself?<br> If we could<br> take a look, Mr. Wigand.<br> Why do you keep this gun?<br> I don't think it's unconstitutional<br> yet to own a gun. I'm a target shooter.<br> That bullet was for a.38 caliber.<br> Do you own a.38?<br> Yes, I do. A.38 Target Master<br> in my gun safe downstairs.<br> A.45 Gold Cup,<br> a.22 target pistol. So what?<br> Do you have a history<br> of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?<br> Yeah. Yes, I do.<br> Yes, I get extremely emotional when<br> assholes put bullets in my mailbox.<br> I didn't tell you that so you could<br> pick it up and take it away.<br> - Jeffrey!<br> - What's going on?<br> I told them you had an e-mail<br> death threat that told you...<br> if you didn't shut the "F" up,<br> they were gonna kill you.<br> You can't take that. It's personal<br> property. My personal correspondence,<br> letters to my brother, my will.<br> You all right?<br> That computer has<br> every single...<br> You all right, Mr. Wigand?<br> We need to take a look<br> at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand.<br> I'm telling you... your agents<br> in that office are acting improperly.<br> Now who are they<br> trying to protect?<br> Let me, tell you something,<br> Lowell. Look, look.<br> You're talking about two agents<br> in a regional office in Louisville.<br> I got the goddamned Unabomber<br> threatening to blow up L.A.X.<br> I gotta move 45 agents<br> from all over the country into L.A.<br> All right? When I get a chance,<br> I'll give it a look.<br> You better take a good<br> look because I'm getting two things:<br> Pissed off and curious!<br> Now, any of these guys been offered jobs<br> in corporate security after they retire?<br> Either one of those guys got<br> ex-agent pals already in those jobs?<br> Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor<br> who's already at Brown & Williamson...<br> as we fuckin' speak!<br> - I'll give it a look.<br> - You're getting my drift?<br> I'll give it a look.<br> So is everything okay?<br> - How are the rooms? Comfortable?<br> - Yes, very.<br> Do you know,<br> I enjoy your work so much.<br> When you're talkin' to somebody,<br> I always feel like I'm right there.<br> Thank you for saying that.<br> Do you think we could<br> talk about the taping?<br> Tomorrow's taping? Just so we<br> can get it out of the way and order.<br> Yeah, well, questions will go<br> towards what work you did there,<br> why you were fired and other...<br> Taping?<br> - What are you taping?<br> - I'm doin' an interview.<br> An interview?<br> Do you know what<br> they will do to us?<br> I thought we...<br> I'm sorry.<br> Liane, this is<br> a preliminary...<br> You didn't<br> tell her we were taping?<br> What did she think she was<br> coming to New York for?<br> Talk about it, think about it.<br> I had a plan to, uh, ease her into it,<br> but I really...<br> I don't know how to do that.<br> Oh, man.<br> Who are these people?<br> Ordinary people under<br> extraordinary pressure, Mike.<br> What the hell you expect,<br> grace and consistency?<br> Five, four, three, two...<br> You heard Mr. Sandefur say...<br> before Congress that he believed<br> nicotine was not addictive.<br> I believe Mr. Sandefur<br> perjured himself...<br> because I watched those<br> testimonies very carefully.<br> All of us did. I mean,<br> there was this whole line of people,<br> whole line of C.E.O. 's<br> up there swearing.<br> Part of the reason<br> I'm here is that I felt...<br> that their representation<br> clearly misstated...<br> at least within Brown & Williamson's<br> representation...<br> clearly misstated what is common<br> language within the company.<br> We are in<br> the nicotine delivery business.<br> And that's what<br> cigarettes are for.<br> Delivery device for nicotine.<br> A delivery device<br> for nicotine.<br> Put it in your mouth, light it up<br> and you're going to get your fix.<br> - You're gonna get your fix.<br> - You're saying that<br> Brown & Williamson...<br> manipulates and adjusts<br> the nicotine fix...<br> not by artificially<br> adding nicotine,<br> but by enhancing<br> the effect of nicotine...<br> through the use<br> of chemical elements such as ammonia.<br> The process is known<br> as impact boosting.<br> While not spiking nicotine,<br> they clearly manipulate it.<br> There is extensive use of this<br> technology, known as ammonia chemistry.<br> It allows for the nicotine to be<br> more rapidly absorbed in the lung...<br> and therefore affect the brain<br> and central nervous system.<br> The straw that broke the camel's<br> back for me and really put me<br> in trouble with Sandefur...<br> was a compound called coumarin.<br> When I came on board<br> at B&W,<br> they had tried to transition<br> from coumarin to a similar flavor...<br> that would give the same taste<br> and had been unsuccessful.<br> I wanted it out immediately.<br> I was told...<br> that it would effect sales, so<br> I should mind my own business.<br> I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur<br> indicating I could not in conscience...<br> continue with coumarin<br> in a product that we now knew...<br> we had documentation... was similar to<br> coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen.<br> And you sent the document<br> forward to Sandefur?<br> I sent the document<br> forward to Sandefur.<br> I was told that we would<br> continue to work on a substitute.<br> We weren't going to remove it<br> as it would impact sales<br> and that that was his decision.<br> In other words,<br> you are charging Sandefur...<br> and Brown & Williamson...<br> with ignoring health<br> considerations consciously?<br> - Most certainly.<br> - And on March 24,<br> Thomas Sandefur,<br> C.E.O. Of Brown & Williamson,<br> had you fired.<br> And the reason<br> he gave you?<br> Poor communication skills.<br> And you wish<br> you hadn't come forward?<br> You wish you hadn't<br> blown the whistle?<br> Yeah, there are times<br> I wish I hadn't done it.<br> There are times I feel com...<br> compelled to do it.<br> If you'd asked me...<br> would I do it again,<br> do I think it's worth it?<br> Yeah, I think it's worth it.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> My name is Jeff Wigand.<br> You can call me, uh,<br> Mr. Wigand.<br> You can call me<br> Dr. Wigand.<br> I have a Ph.D. In biochemistry<br> and endocrinology.<br> You can call me Jeff.<br> Anything else you want to call me,<br> you'll have to do so in private.<br> Um, okay.<br> I find chemistry<br> to be magical.<br> I find it an adventure.<br> An exploration into the building<br> blocks of our physical universe.<br> So how many of you have<br> taken chemistry before?<br> Okay. I've never taught it<br> before, so we're gonna be fine.<br> Our first experiment<br> is gonna be measuring...<br> the molecular weight<br> of butane.<br> He's on line three.<br> - Hello?<br> - Mr. Scruggs? Jeff Wigand.<br> Lowell Bergman said<br> I should give you a call.<br> My co-counsel,<br> Ron Motley and I,<br> have filed a lawsuit against<br> the tobacco industry on behalf<br> of the state of Mississippi...<br> to get the state<br> reimbursed Medicaid costs...<br> for treatin' people<br> with smoking-related illness.<br> If you'd be interested<br> in talkin' to us,<br> we'd certainly like<br> to talk to you.<br> When should we do this?<br> Who the hell are you?<br> What are you doing in my house?<br> - It's okay, Jeff. It's okay.<br> - Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...<br> You've got<br> your own security now.<br> You know, Lowell,<br> I can't... I can't afford to...<br> No, they volunteered.<br> A friend owns a large security company.<br> How're you doing, Mr. Wigand?<br> I'm John Telafarro.<br> There'll be three of us<br> on the detail.<br> I'm going to the store. Please explain<br> our new houseguests to your children.<br> Mrs. Wigand's leaving the house.<br> Uh, I called Richard Scruggs<br> in Mississippi.<br> - I heard.<br> - I'm gonna be a witness for them<br> in their litigation.<br> So I'm gonna fly to Pascagoula,<br> give a deposition.<br> I know. I'm gonna<br> go there tonight.<br> You all right?<br> - Did you have a good day?<br> - Yes, I did. I had a great day.<br> - Uh, coffee, Lowell?<br> - Yeah, all right.<br> Wanna play that game<br> we were playing before?<br> You know, I think you<br> got it up to five.<br> I was ahead of you,<br> and then you just...<br> Please don't wash your hands<br> in the sink.<br> Where should I wash them?<br> Use the bathroom.<br> What's the difference?<br> That's for food.<br> Leave it on.<br> Just leave it on! Okay?<br> I don't think<br> I can do this.<br> I want to stand by<br> my husband.<br> I really do, Jeffrey,<br> but...<br> I don't think I can<br> do this anymore.<br> I am so sorry.<br> Can we talk about this<br> when I get back?<br> Yes, Jeffrey.<br> It's okay.<br> Jeff!<br> You've been served.<br> Now, what this one is is<br> a temporary restraining order,<br> a gag order,<br> issued by a Kentucky court.<br> Jeff Wigand,<br> Michael Moore.<br> Good to meet you,<br> Dr. Wigand.<br> Mike's our attorney general<br> down here.<br> I was just explaining to Jeff<br> they got a Kentucky court...<br> to issue a gag order<br> to stop his deposition today.<br> - Right.<br> - Now,<br> they tried to get<br> the Mississippi court to honor it,<br> but the judge threw it out.<br> However, for you, there is a more<br> perilous effect of the gag order.<br> Dr. Wigand, you do understand<br> what can happen, don't you?<br> I'm not free to testify...<br> here.<br> That's right. If you violate<br> the Kentucky order,<br> when you<br> step foot back in Kentucky...<br> they can find you in contempt<br> and they can incarcerate you.<br> And you ought to know that.<br> - Jail.<br> - Possibly, yes.<br> That is one of the possible consequences<br> of your testifying here today.<br> That's right.<br> How does...<br> How does one go to jail?<br> Wh-What does my family do?<br> Go on welfare?<br> If my wife has to work,<br> who's gonna look after the kids?<br> Put food on the table?<br> I mean, my children need me.<br> If I'm not teaching,<br> there's no medical.<br> No medical, even on co-pay,<br> that's like... Tuition...<br> Dr. Wigand, listen.<br> You may not be able<br> to do this thing.<br> As I understand from Dick,<br> you're our key witness,<br> and I hope<br> you don't withdraw.<br> Um, I guess we'd all<br> understand if you did.<br> Guys, I gotta go.<br> I'm gonna be late for court.<br> I'll see y'all later.<br> Dr. Wigand, good luck.<br> I know what you're facing,<br> Jeff.<br> And I think I know<br> how you're feeling.<br> In the navy, I flew<br> A-6's off carriers.<br> In combat, events have<br> a duration of seconds.<br> Sometimes minutes.<br> But what you're going through<br> goes on day in, day out,<br> whether you're<br> ready for it or not.<br> Week in, week out.<br> Month after month<br> after month.<br> Whether you're up<br> or whether you're down.<br> You're assaulted<br> psychologically.<br> You're assaulted<br> financially,<br> which is its own special kind<br> of violence because it's<br> directed at your kids.<br> What school can you afford?<br> How will that<br> affect their lives?<br> You're asking yourself,<br> "Will that limit<br> what they may become?"<br> You feel your whole family's future<br> is compromised,<br> held hostage.<br> I do know how it is.<br> You attract a crowd.<br> Yeah.<br> Great.<br> I heard about<br> the Kentucky gag order.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Hold on a second.<br> Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he<br> expects his witness to appear or not?<br> I can't seem to find<br> the criteria to decide.<br> It's too big a decision to make<br> without being resolved in my own mind.<br> Maybe things have changed.<br> A lot's changed.<br> You mean since this morning?<br> No, I mean since whenever.<br> Fuck it.<br> Let's go to court.<br> Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.<br> Okay, Jeff. I'm gonna sit you down<br> at that table over there.<br> I want to start<br> as fast as possible.<br> I don't want to give them a chance to<br> get another restraining order. Okay?<br> - Let's go.<br> - Good luck, Doc.<br> Please stand.<br> Raise your right hand.<br> Do you swear to tell the truth,<br> the whole truth and nothing<br> but the truth, so help you God?<br> - I do.<br> - You may be seated.<br> You understand, Dr. Wigand,<br> you are under oath?<br> This is a sworn deposition.<br> There's no judge. It's not a trial.<br> Will you state your name<br> for the record?<br> Jeffrey S. Wigand.<br> R-E-Y. W-I-G-A-N-D.<br> Got any idea what's<br> going on in there?<br> No, I don't have<br> a clue.<br> - That is correct.<br> - In other words, it acts as a drug,<br> - Object to the form of the question.<br> - It acts as a drug...<br> - Object to the form...<br> - It acts as a drug...<br> - Object!<br> - Is there an echo in here?<br> Your objection's been recorded.<br> She typed it into her little machine<br> over there. It's on the record.<br> So now I'll proceed<br> with my deposition of my witness.<br> - Does it act as a drug?<br> - Dr. Wigand!<br> I am instructing you...<br> not to answer that question.<br> In accordance to the terms of<br> the contractual obligations...<br> undertaken by you...<br> not to disclose<br> any information...<br> about your work at the Brown<br> & Williamson Tobacco Company.<br> And in accordance<br> with the force and effect...<br> of the temporary<br> restraining order...<br> that has been<br> entered against you...<br> by the court<br> in the state of Kentucky.<br> That means you don't talk.<br> Mr. Motley, we have rights here.<br> Oh, you've got rights.<br> And lefts.<br> Ups and downs and middles.<br> So what? You don't get<br> to instruct anything around here!<br> This is not North Carolina,<br> not South Carolina, nor Kentucky.<br> This is the sovereign state<br> of Mississippi's proceeding.<br> Wipe that smirk off your face!<br> Dr. Wigand's deposition<br> will be part of this record!<br> And I'm gonna take my witness' testimony<br> whether the hell you like it or not!<br> Answer the question,<br> Doctor.<br> Yes. It produces<br> a physiological response, which<br> meets the definition of a drug.<br> Um, nicotine<br> is associated with...<br> impact, satisfaction.<br> It has a pharmacological effect that<br> crosses the blood-brain barrier intact.<br> Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.<br> One of the reasons<br> I'm here is that I felt...<br> that their representation<br> clearly...<br> Run that Sandefur piece<br> on "nicotine's not addictive."<br> Run that on camera, then cut right to<br> Wigand with "I believe they perjured..."<br> Then go wide to the C.E.O. S<br> all taking the oath.<br> Then back on Jeff...<br> and play the pause after<br> the word "felt" on the B-side.<br> Hell of a show, Mike.<br> Explosive material.<br> - It went great in Mississippi, Mike.<br> - Good.<br> - I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.<br> - Yeah.<br> They argued that he was going<br> to reveal the secret formula<br> of Kools to the world.<br> Sealed doesn't hurt Scruggs litigation,<br> and since we're the only ones<br> with the story, I believe<br> we're sitting on an exclusive.<br> I like that.<br> Corporate has some questions.<br> We've got a meeting at "Black Rock"<br> first thing in the morning.<br> - When's the air date?<br> - Lowell, Sharon's on line three.<br> - Tell her I'll call her back in ten.<br> - Here we go.<br> That they had long<br> known that the nicotine in tobacco...<br> is an addictive drug despite their<br> public statements to the contrary.<br> Like the testimony before Congress<br> of Dr. Wigand's former boss,<br> Brown & Williamson's chief<br> executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.<br> I believe that nicotine<br> is not addictive.<br> I believe Mr. Sandefur<br> perjured himself...<br> because I watched those<br> testimonies very carefully.<br> All of us did.<br> There was this whole line of people,<br> whole line of C.E.O.'s<br> up there all swearing.<br> Part of the reason<br> I'm here is that I felt...<br> that their representation<br> clearly misstated...<br> what is common language<br> within the company.<br> We are in the nicotine<br> delivery business.<br> There is extensive use of this<br> technology, known as ammonia chemistry.<br> It allows for the nicotine to be<br> more rapidly absorbed in the lung...<br> and therefore affect the brain<br> and central nervous system.<br> That's what cigarettes are for.<br> - Delivery device for nicotine.<br> A delivery device<br> for nicotine. Put it in your mouth,<br> light it up and<br> you're going to get your fix.<br> You're going to get your fix.<br> - Shall I send for coffee?<br> Sorry I'm late.<br> - No, we're fine.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yeah.<br> All right. I thought<br> we'd get together...<br> because there's<br> a legal concept...<br> that has been getting<br> some new attention recently.<br> Tortious interference.<br> If two people have an agreement,<br> like a confidentiality agreement,<br> and one of them breaks it because they<br> are induced to do so by a third party,<br> the third party can be sued<br> for damages for interfering.<br> Hence, tortious interference.<br> "Interfering"?<br> That's what we do.<br> I think what we're trying to tell you<br> is that it happens all the time.<br> This is a news organization. People are<br> always telling us things they shouldn't.<br> We have to verify if it's true<br> and in the public interest.<br> And if it is, we air it.<br> And after we corroborate it.<br> That's why we've never lost<br> a lawsuit and run a classy show.<br> - Anything else?<br> - And 60 Minutes' verification<br> is exact and precise.<br> And I don't think it would hurt<br> to make sure you're right on this one.<br> Why? You think we have liability?<br> What's the CBS News position,<br> Eric?<br> There's a possibility.<br> It's rather remote.<br> But one we<br> have to check on, Mike.<br> I've retained outside counsel<br> to do exactly that...<br> on a segment, I might add,<br> that's already rife with problems.<br> What does that mean?<br> "Rife with..."<br> I'm told unusual promises<br> were made to Wigand.<br> No, only that we would hold his story<br> until it was safe for him.<br> And I'm told there are questions<br> as to our star witness' veracity.<br> His "veracity" was good enough<br> for the state of Mississippi.<br> Our standards have to be<br> higher than anyone else's,<br> because we are the standard<br> for everybody else.<br> Well, as a "standard," I'll hang with<br> "is this guy telling the truth?"<br> Well, with tortious interference,<br> I'm afraid...<br> the greater the truth,<br> the greater the damage.<br> - Come again?<br> - They own...<br> the information he's disclosing.<br> The truer it is,<br> the greater<br> the damage to them.<br> If he lied, he didn't<br> disclose their information,<br> and the damages are smaller.<br> - Is this Alice in Wonderland?<br> - You said "on this one."<br> What about this one?<br> If this holds up...<br> And it very well may not, Mike.<br> But if it did<br> and we aired this segment,<br> and CBS was sued<br> by Brown & Williamson,<br> I think we could be<br> at grave risk.<br> - How grave?<br> - Well, at the end of the day,<br> because of your segment,<br> the Brown & Williamson<br> Tobacco Company...<br> could own CBS.<br> Oh. You know,<br> I am sorry,<br> but I'm due upstairs.<br> Is CBS Corporate<br> telling CBS News...<br> "Do not go to air<br> with this story"?<br> You're getting ahead of yourself.<br> We're all in this together.<br> We're all CBS.<br> We'll find out soon.<br> Thank you, gentlemen.<br> "Tortious interference."<br> That sounds like a disease<br> caught by a radio.<br> - Lunch?<br> - Sure.<br> Don't worry.<br> We call the shots around here.<br> Hello?<br> Debbie, it's me. I want<br> you to check some filings,<br> and give me John Wilson's number<br> at Bear-Stearn.<br> - What now?<br> - Kluster's coming over.<br> Hello, Lowell, Mike.<br> Don.<br> There has been so much soul searching<br> about this Wigand.<br> I've decided we should cut<br> an alternate version of<br> the show without his interview.<br> I've decided we should cut<br> an alternate version of<br> the show without his interview.<br> So what happened to Ms. Caperelli's<br> checking with outside counsel first?<br> - All that crap?<br> - That's happening.<br> Hopefully, we won't have to use<br> the alternate, but we should<br> have it in the can.<br> - I'm not touching my film.<br> - I'm afraid you are.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - We're doing this<br> with or without you, Lowell.<br> If you like, I can assign<br> another producer to edit your show.<br> Since when has the, uh,<br> paragon of<br> investigative journalism...<br> allowed lawyers to determine<br> the news content on 60 Minutes?<br> It's an alternate version.<br> So what if we have<br> an alternate version?<br> And I don't think our being cautious<br> is so damned unreasonable.<br> So now, if you will<br> excuse me, gentlemen,<br> Mr. Rather's been complaining<br> about his chair again.<br> Before you go,<br> I discovered this.<br> S.E.C. Filing for the sale of CBS<br> Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.<br> - What?<br> - Yeah, I heard rumors.<br> It's not a rumor. It's a sale.<br> If Tisch can unload CBS...<br> for $81 a share<br> to Westinghouse,<br> and then is<br> suddenly threatened...<br> with a multi-billion dollar<br> lawsuit from Brown & Williamson,<br> that could screw up the sale,<br> could it not?<br> - What are you implying?<br> - I'm not implying. I'm quoting.<br> Uh, " More vested interests. Persons<br> who will profit from this merger.<br> "Ms. Helen Caperelli, general counsel<br> of CBS News, 3.9 million.<br> "Mr. Eric Kluster,<br> president of CBS News,<br> Are you suggesting that<br> she and Eric are influenced by money?<br> No, no, of course they're not<br> influenced by money. They work for free.<br> And you are a volunteer<br> executive producer.<br> CBS does not do that. And you're<br> questioning our journalistic integrity.<br> No, I'm questioning<br> your hearing.<br> You hear "reasonable"<br> and "tortious interference."<br> I hear "potential Brown<br> & Williamson lawsuit...<br> jeopardizing the sale<br> of CBS to Westinghouse."<br> I hear "Shut the segment down.<br> Cut Wigand loose.<br> Obey orders and fuck off."<br> That's what I hear.<br> - You're exaggerating.<br> - I am?<br> You pay me<br> to go get guys like Wigand,<br> to draw him out, to get him to trust<br> us, to get him to go on television.<br> I do. I deliver him.<br> He sits. He talks.<br> He violates his own fucking<br> confidentiality agreement.<br> And he's only the key witness in the<br> biggest public health reform issue,<br> maybe the biggest,<br> most expensive...<br> corporate malfeasance case<br> in U.S. History.<br> And Jeffrey Wigand,<br> who's out on a limb,<br> does he go on television<br> and tell the truth?<br> Yes.<br> Is it newsworthy?<br> Yes.<br> Are we gonna air it?<br> Of course not. Why?<br> Because he's not<br> telling the truth? No.<br> Because he is telling the truth.<br> That's why we're not gonna air it.<br> And the more truth he tells,<br> the worse it gets.<br> You are a fanatic,<br> an anarchist. You know that?<br> If we can't have a whole show, then<br> I want half a show rather than no show.<br> But, oh, no. Not you. You<br> won't be satisfied unless you're<br> putting the company at risk!<br> What are you? Are you a businessman<br> or are you a newsman?<br> Because that happens to be<br> what Mike and I...<br> and some other people<br> around here do for a living.<br> - Lowell...<br> - Put the corporation at risk?<br> Give me a fucking break!<br> These people are<br> putting our whole reason...<br> - for doing what we do on the line!<br> - Lowell!<br> What?<br> I'm with Don<br> on this.<br> What's wrong?<br> They're killing<br> the Wigand interview.<br> - What?<br> - They're pretending it's process.<br> That's bullshit. It's foregone.<br> What are you and Mike<br> gonna do?<br> I'm alone on this.<br> - Oh, baby.<br> - Yeah.<br> It's Jeffrey Wigand.<br> Jeffrey.<br> How are you?<br> How's the family?<br> Okay?<br> - There is... There is no family.<br> - What do you mean, "there is no family"?<br> Uh, Liane has filed for divorce.<br> And, so,<br> I've moved out.<br> I see the girls<br> a couple of days a week.<br> - Where are you staying now?<br> - Our favorite hotel, honey.<br> I checked into room 930.<br> Odd choice, huh?<br> I don't know how<br> to say this,<br> Jeff, except to just<br> say it right out.<br> So, uh, I'll say it.<br> They do not want to air it.<br> - What?<br> - B&W may have threatened litigation.<br> CBS is on the block.<br> - But you, I mean... I know how you...<br> - No.<br> No, what?<br> I do not think that you know for me<br> what it is to walk in my shoes.<br> For my kids<br> to have seen it,<br> for them to know why I've<br> put them through what I did.<br> The public airing of that,<br> the testament to why I did what I did.<br> You're telling me it's not<br> gonna see the light of day?<br> Jeff.<br> Mrs. Wigand?<br> It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand<br> for some time.<br> I'm an investigator, and I was<br> wondering if I could ask you a<br> couple of questions about that.<br> All right.<br> Um, seven months<br> after we were married,<br> we found out that I had<br> multiple sclerosis.<br> And you had a daughter, Diane...<br> Tommy Sandefur told me himself.<br> He's not going to allow Brown<br> & Williamson to be demonized<br> to the American public.<br> So I told Pete Jennings.<br> And I... Hold on.<br> You had multiple sclerosis.<br> You had a small child to raise.<br> Uh, mention that part in the<br> executive summary and in the chapters.<br> First wife<br> and estrangement of daughter.<br> So I was telling Pete, I said,<br> "You've been taken in by this guy."<br> The divorce was something<br> that we both wanted.<br> He's a shoplifter.<br> He's a convicted<br> shoplifter.<br> So, um, what are you<br> gonna do?<br> What do you think I'm gonna do?<br> Quit in protest?<br> I'm not gonna do that.<br> You're taking "no"<br> for an answer?<br> No, I'm not gonna take<br> "no" for an answer. No.<br> You're not?<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm staying right here, doing my job.<br> Fighting to get my show on the air.<br> You don't like it?<br> Hey, I tell you what?<br> Fire my ass.<br> End up in a high-profile lawsuit with<br> Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?<br> I don't think so.<br> Take a look at this.<br> This is a summary of a dossier<br> that's being prepared.<br> He wouldn't lie<br> about his whole life.<br> Who's gonna believe him<br> about anything he says?<br> The Wall Street Journal is doing<br> a major story, and, I think, the Post.<br> You backed the wrong horse.<br> The version without the interview<br> is gonna air the week after next.<br> What was that about?<br> - Get me Wigand.<br> - Sure.<br> What the fuck is this?<br> Fuck!<br> You never told me<br> you were married before.<br> - That you had a daughter.<br> - How is that any of your business?<br> That is not something<br> that you people need to know.<br> Oh, you know what we do<br> or do not need to know?<br> - Since when have you become<br> a media expert?<br> - What do you wanna do, Lowell?<br> - Look up my ass too?<br> - Oh, for God's sake.<br> - You're not even on this anymore.<br> What do you care?<br> - Jeff, wake the fuck up!<br> Everybody is on the line here.<br> If they catch you in a lie,<br> they can paint everything with<br> that brush, you understand?<br> - Everything you say.<br> - I told the truth.<br> Everything you say.<br> And I can't defend you, man,<br> with one hand tied<br> behind my back...<br> because you keep from me<br> what they can discover.<br> And they will discover<br> everything. Believe me.<br> I was young!<br> I was young!<br> Confused. We didn't<br> handle it the right way.<br> - She sued you for back payments<br> of child support?<br> - She did not sue me.<br> We had a dispute over money. I settled<br> it. She dropped the complaint.<br> - Any other questions?<br> - Yes. Did you lie...<br> about being on the American<br> judo team in the Olympics?<br> - What?<br> - Some public relations guy...<br> got hold of a tape of an interview<br> where you're saying...<br> you were on the American<br> judo team in the Olympics.<br> What kind of shit is this?<br> I... I was...<br> I was not on the team.<br> I sparred with the Olympic team.<br> - Okay?<br> - All right.

I gotta go.<br> - I gotta teach class.<br> - And I gotta refute every<br> fucking accusation made...<br> in this report before<br> the Wall Street Journal runs.<br> I am trying to protect you,<br> man.<br> I hope you improve<br> your batting average.<br> They're cutting the interest rate,<br> and I have that great feature...<br> - Hello?<br> - It's Lowell.<br> Are you guys planning to do a piece on<br> a former top executive in Big Tobacco?<br> - You caught me in a news meeting.<br> - Are you, are you not, Charlie?<br> You bet we are,<br> and I can't talk to you now.<br> - We gotta hook up.<br> - Sure.

Jack, listen to me.<br> Their strategy: Discredit<br> this guy, ruin his reputation<br> in the Wall Street Journal...<br> and then nobody will ever listen<br> to what he's got to say about tobacco.<br> He's dead unless I can<br> get this thing knocked down.<br> Make it even<br> a little more attractive.<br> I don't know if you're<br> ever gonna get paid.<br> - Is there any truth to any of it?<br> - That's a good question.<br> "Is there any truth to any of it?"<br> I doubt it.<br> - What's the deadline?<br> - Soon.<br> - Fax me the summary.<br> - That's great, Jack.<br> - Hey.

About as hard to get<br> ahold of as the Manhattan phone book.<br> Well, it's authoritive...<br> and overwhelmingly documented.<br> And it's bullshit. And if<br> I'm right, are you gonna put...<br> the Journal's reputation behind a story<br> that's gonna blow up in your face?<br> I'll take a look at what you got<br> but I'm not moving any deadlines<br> because you say so.<br> Are you all right?<br> Yeah.<br> Officer Muravchick?<br> Thank you.<br> Officer Muravchick,<br> how are you?<br> - I'm Sandra Sutherland.<br> - How do you do?<br> Fine, thank you.<br> I'm doing a background check.<br> Mind if I sit down?<br> Your Honor,<br> could I have a word with you?<br> You presided in a dispute<br> over support payments.<br> Jeffrey Wigand?<br> Yeah, I cited him.<br> CBS is under criticism because<br> the CBS News program, 60 Minutes,<br> will not be presenting<br> an interview...<br> What the hell<br> are you doing?<br> What does it look like<br> I'm doing? I'm editing.<br> No, no, no that. I'm talking<br> about the Associated Press.<br> They got the story that<br> we pulled this interview,<br> and they talked to Mike and I.<br> Did you tell them<br> that we were lying?<br> No!<br> I should have.<br> I told them I disagreed<br> with you, Mike and Kluster...<br> that this segment<br> is as good as the original.<br> I'm not lying for you.<br> I'm not gonna shut up for you.<br> - Not on any of it.<br> - Hey, I'm not gonna fire you.<br> Okay? Take a vacation. Now!<br> Lowell? Look, I've decided<br> to preface Sunday's show.<br> I did three minutes on the<br> Evening News. You'll want to see it.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I've been banished...<br> in lieu of being fired.<br> I took off on Tisch.<br> I took off on Corporate.<br> They'll know they're not, uh, going<br> to see everything on Sunday night.<br> I don't know. How does that<br> get Wigand on the air?<br> Do me a favor,<br> will you? Spare me.<br> For God's sake, get in the<br> real world. What do you think?<br> I'm going to resign in protest<br> to force it on the air?<br> The answer's no. I don't plan<br> to spend the end of my days...<br> wandering in the wilderness<br> of National Public Radio.<br> That decision<br> I've already made.<br> This Sunday,<br> Wallace will broadcast a report...<br> on the tobacco industry,<br> including the tough tactics<br> tobacco companies employ...<br> to keep a lid on information<br> that might be damaging.<br> Is there information<br> that people should have...<br> that they're not going to have<br> because you're not going to<br> broadcast this interview?<br> - Yes.<br> - Today, CBS News president<br> Eric Kluster...<br> defended the network's decision<br> not to broadcast...<br> key portions<br> of the controversial interview.<br> Mr. Kluster said, quote,<br> "The atmosphere is tougher than ever."<br> - Where's the rest?<br> - Dan.<br> Where the hell's the rest?<br> - Nebraska football<br> fans voiced their criticism...<br> - You cut it!<br> Coming up in<br> Bernard Goldberg's America.<br> - You cut the guts out of what I said!<br> - It was a time consideration...<br> Time? Bullshit!<br> You corporate lackey.<br> Who told you your incompetent<br> little fingers have the<br> requisite skills to edit me?<br> I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation<br> here, and you're too dim...<br> Mike. Mike. Mike.<br> "Mike"? Mike!<br> Try "Mr. Wallace."<br> We work in the same corporation. Doesn't<br> mean we work in the same profession.<br> Now, now what are you going to do now?<br> You going to finesse me?<br> Lawyer me some more? I've been<br> in this profession 50 fucking years!<br> You and the people you work for<br> are destroying the most respected,<br> the highest rated, the most<br> profitable show on this network.<br> Here. These are<br> their leads, their sources.<br> - I want you to have your reporters...<br> - Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.<br> Have them make<br> their own calls.<br> They'll find that these sources<br> have a different story than<br> the one that's in the dossier.<br> Push the deadline,<br> Charlie.<br> I'll push it for a week.<br> I want Milo and Suein to go through it.<br> What do you want<br> to buy him for a gift?<br> Mmm, he's into<br> kind of little cars that, um...<br> - That remote control thing?<br> - Yeah.<br> All right.<br> We'll go do that tomorrow.<br> The 63-36 vote was three<br> shy of the two-thirds needed to pass...<br> - Mom. There's Dad.<br> - Yes?<br> - On the TV.<br> - ... dating back to 1986.<br> The most recent trouble<br> for Wigand occurred here...<br> And in local news,<br> WLKO, Louisville,<br> has gained access<br> to a 500-page dossier...<br> on former Brown & Williamson<br> research head, Jeffrey Wigand,<br> detailing charges of shoplifting<br> and failing to pay child support.<br> Wigand is currently teaching<br> chemistry and Japanese...<br> at the<br> DuPont Manual High School.<br> Maria.<br> Thousands of documents<br> from inside the tobacco industry...<br> have surfaced<br> over the past year.<br> Documents that<br> appear to confirm...<br> what a former<br> U.S. Surgeon general...<br> and the current head of the Food and<br> Drug Administration have been saying.<br> We learned of a tobacco insider<br> who could tell us...<br> whether or not the tobacco industry<br> has been leveling with the public.<br> That insider was formerly...<br> a highly-placed executive<br> with a tobacco company.<br> But we cannot broadcast what critical<br> information about tobacco,<br> addiction and public health<br> he might be able to offer.<br> Why? Because he had to sign<br> a confidentiality agreement...<br> with the tobacco company<br> he worked for.<br> The management of CBS<br> has told us...<br> that knowing<br> he had that agreement...<br> if we were to broadcast<br> an interview with him,<br> CBS could be faced with<br> a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.<br> The fact is, we are not allowed<br> even to mention his name...<br> or the name of the company<br> he worked for.<br> And, of course, we cannot<br> show you his face.<br> And your confidentiality<br> agreement with...<br> - Is still in force?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> So what are they gonna do?<br> Sue you for making this appearance?<br> I would bet on it.<br> The former executive<br> has reason to bet on being sued,<br> for major cigarette<br> manufacturers...<br> Yeah.<br> You disappeared on me.<br> - How long you staying?<br> - I disappeared on you?<br> All right.<br> What did you think?<br> I think it was<br> a disgrace.<br> - Still no answer.<br> - Get me the manager's office.<br> David. David, you've got<br> a call on line four.<br> I think you<br> better take it.<br> This is David McDougal.<br> How can I help you?<br> Mr. McDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.<br> I'm a producer for 60 Minutes.<br> I'm concerned for a friend of mine<br> who's staying at your hotel right now.<br> Mr. Wigand?<br> Mr. Wigand?<br> I-I think I need to call the police.<br> He won't respond.<br> No, no, don't call the police. Just<br> tell him I'm on the phone with you.<br> My name is Lowell Bergman.<br> Just tell him that.<br> Mr. Wigand, Mr. Bergman<br> is on the telephone.<br> Did he hear you?<br> You're breaking up. I can't hear you.<br> What about now?<br> - What?<br> - Hello? Can you hear me now?<br> - What's happening?<br> - He doesn't seem to be listening.<br> All right. Now listen to me.<br> I want you... I want you to tell him...<br> in these words:<br> Get on the fucking phone.<br> I-I can't say that.<br> No, you can. Tell him<br> to get on the fucking phone!<br> He told me to tell you<br> to get on the... fucking phone!<br> You manipulated me into this.<br> - That's bullshit, Jeff.<br> - You greased the rails.<br> I greased the rails for a guy who wanted<br> to say "yes." I helped him to say "yes."<br> That's all.<br> You're not a robot, Jeff.<br> - All right? You got a mind<br> of your own, don't you?<br> - " Up to you, Jeffrey.<br> "That's the power you have,<br> Jeffrey.<br> Vital inside information<br> the American public need to know."<br> Lowell Bergman... the hotshot who never<br> met a source he couldn't turn around.<br> I fought for you,<br> and I still fight for you!<br> You fought for me?<br> You manipulated me...<br> into where I am now... staring<br> at the Brown & Williamson building!<br> It's all dark except the tenth floor.<br> That's the legal department.<br> That's where they<br> fuck with my life.<br> Jeffrey, where you going<br> with this?<br> So, where you going?<br> You are... important...<br> to a lot of people,<br> Jeffrey.<br> You think about that.<br> You think about them.<br> I'm running out<br> of heroes, man.<br> Guys like you<br> are in short supply.<br> Yeah, guys like you too.<br> Where are you, anyway?<br> I'm on a leave of absence.<br> Forced vacation.<br> - You try and have a good time.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, I will.<br> I'm Lowell Bergman. I'm from 60 Minutes.<br> You know, you take the 60 Minutes...<br> out of that sentence,<br> nobody returns your phone calls.<br> Maybe Wigand's right.<br> Maybe I'm hooked.<br> What am I hooked on?<br> The rush of 60 Minutes?<br> What the hell for?<br> "Infotainment"!<br> It's so fucking useless,<br> all of it.<br> So it's a big country with a free press.<br> You can go and work somewhere else.<br> "Free press"?<br> The press is free.<br> For anyone who owns one.<br> Larry Tisch has a free press.<br> - Get some perspective, Lowell.<br> - I got perspective.<br> No, you do not.<br> From my perspective,<br> what's been going on and what<br> I've been doing is ridiculous.<br> - It's half-measures.<br> - You're not listening.<br> Really know what you're<br> going to do before you do it.<br> I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone.<br> Patch him through.<br> Well, Lowell, you are<br> not gonna believe this.<br> The governor of Mississippi<br> is suing his own attorney general...<br> to abandon litigation<br> against Big Tobacco.<br> - Oh, good.<br> - But now that the version<br> without Jeff ran,<br> what's the chance of getting<br> his interview on the air?<br> - Hello?<br> - Yeah, I'm here.<br> What chance is there of getting<br> Jeff's interview on the air?<br> Less than great.<br> I'd be lying to you<br> if I did not tell you...<br> how important it was<br> in the court of public opinion.<br> I'd be lying to you<br> if I didn't tell you...<br> I'm about out of moves,<br> Dick.<br> All right.<br> See ya.<br> Hi.<br> So, what are you folks<br> doing... here in Lincoln?<br> - Geology survey.<br> - Geology?<br> Yeah?<br> Really?<br> How about you?<br> I work for CBS News.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Just ran into<br> two of your geologists.<br> Geologists whose hands<br> aren't all chewed up.<br> Lowell, do not...<br> screw this up.<br> We are a week away<br> from an arrest.<br> - So I'll hold it. And?<br> - We'll give you a heads-up<br> before we launch.<br> - How long?<br> - Three hours.<br> You got a deal.<br> ... like the testimony before Congress<br> of Dr. Wigand's former boss,<br> Brown & Williamson's chief<br> executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.<br> I believe that nicotine<br> is not addictive.<br> I believe Mr. Sandefur<br> perjured himself...<br> - because I watched those<br> testimonies very carefully.<br> - All of us did.<br> There was this<br> whole line of people,<br> whole line of C.E.O.'s<br> up there all swearing.<br> Part of the reason I'm here<br> is that I felt...<br> that their representation...<br> ...can be more rapidly absorbed<br> in the lung...<br> and therefore affect the brain<br> and central nervous system.<br> - Hello?<br> - Jim, it's Lowell.<br> - Hey, where are you?<br> - Remember that night at P.J.'s?<br> You asked me if we were<br> sitting on something explosive.<br> Well, we're not sitting on it.<br> CBS Corporate leaned on CBS News,<br> which yanked an interview we did...<br> with a top-ranking tobacco scientist,<br> corporate officer.<br> They're trying to<br> close down the story.<br> You mean, 60 Minutes<br> is letting CBS Corporate...<br> decide what is<br> or is not news?<br> What's Wallace think<br> about this? Or Hewitt, or...<br> How prominent?<br> What kind of placement?<br> Oh, come on, Lowell. This is<br> The New York Times. I don't know.<br> Well, until you do, all I can<br> tell you is what you already know.<br> They will not<br> air an interview.<br> Call me back in ten.<br> - Hello?<br> - Debbie, it's me.<br> Hi.<br> What time is it?<br> - Oh, it's late.<br> - That I know. When are you coming back?<br> I can't get out of here till<br> mid-morning. I'll be in tomorrow night.<br> Listen, could you call a number<br> for me? It's in Mississippi.<br> Okay.<br> Hold on a second.<br> What is it?<br> - Hello?<br> - It's Lowell.<br> All right, Lowell. Page one.<br> Editorial's interested. Let's talk.<br> Here's how it works. You ask me<br> questions. I tell you if you're wrong.<br> - Lowell, you sure you want to do this?<br> - Why?<br> Hey, it doesn't work,<br> you've burned your bridges, man.<br> You ready?<br> Okay.<br> About this whistle-blower,<br> did Mike and Don go along<br> with the corporate decision?<br> - Lowell?<br> - Did I tell you you were wrong?<br> No. Um, I'm assuming<br> the cave-in begins...<br> with the threat of litigation<br> from Big Tobacco.<br> Are we talking, uh...<br> Are we talking<br> Brown & Williamson here?<br> Did I get you up?<br> No, I usually sit around<br> my hotel room dressed like this<br> at 5:30 in the morning,<br> sleepy look on my face.<br> How many shows have<br> we done? Huh?<br> - Come on. How many?<br> - Oh, lots.<br> That's right.<br> But in all that time,<br> Mike,<br> did you ever get off a plane,<br> walk into a room...<br> and find that a source<br> for a story changed his mind?<br> Lost his heart?<br> Walked out on us?<br> Not one fucking time.<br> You wanna know why?<br> I see a rhetorical question<br> on the horizon.<br> I'm gonna tell you why.<br> Because when I tell someone<br> I'm gonna do something, I deliver.<br> Oh, how fortunate I am to have<br> Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage...<br> - to point me down the shining<br> path, to show me the way.<br> - Oh, please, Mike.<br> - Give me a break.<br> - You give me a break.<br> I never left a source<br> hung out to dry ever.<br> Abandoned.<br> Not till right fucking now.<br> When I came on this job,<br> I came with my word intact.<br> I'm gonna leave with my word intact.<br> Fuck the rules of the game!<br> Hell, you're supposed<br> to know me, Mike.<br> What the hell<br> did you expect?<br> You expect me to lie down?<br> Back off?<br> Or get over it?<br> In the real world, when you get to where<br> I am, there are other considerations.<br> Like what?<br> Corporate responsibility?<br> - What, are we talking celebrity here?<br> - I'm not...<br> I'm not talking about<br> celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm...<br> I'm...<br> I'm talking about...<br> when you're nearer the end<br> of your life than the beginning.<br> And what do you think<br> you think about then? The future?<br> "In the future, I'm gonna<br> do this, become that"?<br> What future? No.<br> What you think is...<br> "How will I be regarded<br> in the end...<br> after I'm gone?"<br> Oh, along the way, I suppose<br> I made some minor impact.<br> I did Irangate,<br> the Ayatollah, Malcolm X,<br> Martin Luther King,<br> Saddam, Sadat, etc., etc.<br> I showed them thieves in suits.<br> I spent a lifetime building...<br> all that.<br> But history only remembers most<br> what you did last.<br> And should that be<br> fronting a segment...<br> that allowed a tobacco giant<br> to crash this network...<br> Does it give someone...<br> at my time of life pause?<br> Yeah.<br> Mike,<br> in my...<br> You and I<br> have been doing this...<br> together for 14 years.<br> This is today's<br> New York Times.<br> In it is the whole<br> sordid story...<br> of what went on<br> inside our shop.<br> And in the editorial,<br> it accuses us...<br> of betraying the legacy<br> of Edward R. Murrow.<br> They conclude most of it<br> seems pretty unsubstantiated.<br> You're full of shit,<br> John.<br> Yeah.<br> Front page. There's a picture of Wigand.<br> Article's entitled,<br> "Getting Personal."<br> Byline to Suein Hwang<br> and Milo Geyelin.<br> Wait. Hold on<br> a second, Lowell.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I'll see<br> if I can find him.<br> Yeah, hold on.<br> Don's looking for you.<br> - Good.<br> - The subheading<br> is " Brown & Williamson...<br> has a 500-page dossier<br> attacking chief critic."<br> It quotes Richard Scruggs<br> calling it the worst kind...<br> of an organized smear campaign<br> against a whistle-blower.<br> "A close look at the file<br> and independent research<br> by this newspaper...<br> "into its key claim indicates<br> that many of the serious allegations...<br> against Mr. Wigand are backed by<br> scant or contradictory evidence."<br> This news division has been vilified...<br> in The New York Times,<br> in print, on television...<br> for caving<br> to corporate interests!<br> The New York Times ran a<br> blow-by-blow of what we talked<br> about behind closed doors.<br> - You fucked us!<br> - No! You fucked you!<br> Don't invert stuff.<br> Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand.<br> You bought it.<br> The Wall Street Journal...<br> here... not exactly...<br> a bastion of<br> anti-capitalist sentiment,<br> refutes Big Tobacco's<br> smear campaign...<br> as the lowest form<br> of character assassination.<br> And now, even now,<br> when every word...<br> of what Wigand has said<br> on our show is printed,<br> the entire deposition<br> of his testimony in a court of law...<br> in the state of Mississippi,<br> the cat...<br> totally out of the bag,<br> you're still<br> standing here debating.<br> Don, what the hell else<br> do you need?<br> Mike, you tell him.<br> You fucked up, Don.<br> It's old news. Stick with me,<br> like always. We'll be okay.<br> These things have<br> a half-life of 15 minutes.<br> No, that's fame.<br> Fame has a 15-minute half-life.<br> Infamy lasts<br> a little longer.<br> We caved. It's foolish.<br> It's simply dead wrong.<br> Now this is what we're going to do.<br> We're going over to Black Rock...<br> Okay? So let's get back to work.<br> Now what we saw there...<br> was two potassium chlorate...<br> would yield two potassium<br> chloride, also a solid...<br> They cancelled the 6:00.<br> I don't know why. I...<br> I'm on the 8:10.<br> I should be home... 9:30.<br> I'll see you then.<br> I love you. Bye.<br> - Oh. Thanks, Dad.<br> - Thanks.<br> CBS management wouldn't<br> let us broadcast...<br> our original story and our<br> interview with Jeffrey Wigand...<br> because they were worried<br> about the possibility...<br> of a multi-billion dollar<br> lawsuit against us...<br> for tortious interference.<br> But now things have changed.<br> What Dr. Wigand told us<br> was that his former...<br> This industry,<br> in my opinion, is an industry...<br> that has perpetrated the biggest fraud<br> on the American public in history.<br> They've killed millions<br> and millions of...<br> You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?<br> Yeah, there are times<br> I wish I hadn't done it.<br> There are times I feel com...<br> compelled to do it.<br> If you ask me...<br> would I do it again,<br> do I think it's worth it?<br> Yeah, I think it's worth it.<br> I promised you a three-hour<br> heads up. Here it is.<br> Have a camera crew standing by<br> in Helena, Montana on Tuesday,<br> and I'll give you<br> a three-hour head start.<br> All right? By the way, that was<br> a hell of a good show tonight.<br> - Thank you, Bill.<br> - Yeah.<br> You won.<br> Yeah.<br> What did I win?<br> Reporting<br> from CBS News world headquarters<br> in New York, good afternoon.<br> There has been a major break in<br> the case of the so-called Unabomber.<br> CBS News has learned<br> that a remote homesite...<br> outside of Lincoln, Montana...<br> has been under F.B.I.<br> Surveillance for several weeks.<br> Great, Lowell.<br> Thanks for this.<br> You know, we beat everybody.<br> ABC, NBC, CNN.<br> Mike.<br> That Canada story...<br> still interest you?<br> Everything interests me.<br> Uh, I quit, Mike.<br> Bullshit.<br> Come on.<br> It all worked out.<br> You came out okay<br> in the end.<br> I did?<br> What do I tell a source<br> on the next tough story?<br> "Hang in with us.<br> You'll be fine. Maybe."<br> No.<br> What got broken here...<br> doesn't go<br> back together again.<br> So, uh...<br>
