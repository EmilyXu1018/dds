Thatcher<br> con... 29,697<br> xxx<br> Mrs Marg.. Thatcher.<br> xxx... Please.<br> xxx<br> Mrs Thatcher!<br> Mrs Thatcher! Airey Neave.<br> Welcome to the madhouse. Follow me.<br> Welcome... xxx<br> Order<br> The Right Honourable Lady the<br> Secretary of State for Education.<br> The right honourable gentleman knows<br> that we have no choice but to shut down the schools!<br> Because...<br> his union paymasters have called a<br> strike deliberately to cripple our economy.<br> Teachers cannot teach when there is no<br> heating, no lighting in their classrooms.<br> And I ask the honourable gentleman,<br> whose fault is that?<br> Me thinks the Right Honourable<br> lady doth screech to much.<br> If she wants us to take her seriously<br> she must learn to calm down!<br> If the right honorable gentleman could<br> perhaps attend more closely to...<br> What I am saying,<br> rather than HOW I am saying it,<br> he may receive a valuable<br> education in spite of himself!<br> Why has this Conservative<br> government failed?<br> Why has it forced so many<br> in the public sector into<br> taking strike action<br> to save their own jobs?<br> Minister...<br> the breakdown of essential public<br> services in transport, electricity...<br> sanitation is not the fault<br> of the trades unions...<br> but of this Conservative government<br> in which you so shamefully serve!<br> So these power cuts will continue<br> unless we can reach a compromise.<br> The miners are asking for<br> a 35% increase in wages.<br> Obviously we cant go<br> anywhere near that.<br> The unions are not our enemies<br> and never have been.<br> We want- and have always wanted<br> the broadest consensus<br> Im sure we are all in agreement<br> that we must do nothing...<br> for the moment that will further<br> inflame the current situation.<br> Hear hear, Prime Minister.<br> - the fact of the matter is,<br> its absolutely crucial...<br> that we are seen by the public<br> to be acting as conciliators...<br> and not aggressors.<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, Education Secretary.<br> Yes, Prime Minister.<br> With the Miners leader calling<br> today for the army to mutiny...<br> in support of the strikes, this seems<br> the wrong time for conciliation.<br> Be patient. Theyll come back<br> on in a minute.<br> xxx<br> Thank you, Margaret.<br> Your thoughts are duly noted.<br> We on this island are strong.<br> Were self-reliant. Napoleon<br> called us a nation of shopkeepers.<br> He meant it as an insult<br> but to me its a compliment.<br> Thats why he couldnt beat us,<br> and thats why Hitler cant beat us.<br> We Conservatives believe in giving people<br> the freedom and opportunity to...<br> fulfil their own potential,<br> especially the young.<br> Theres no good in pretending<br> were all equal...<br> were not all the same, never<br> have been, never will be.<br> We should encourage our children to<br> aspire to achieve more than we have...<br> for our children today will<br> be the leaders of tomorrow.<br> Its 1974 and youd think<br> it was WWII.<br> Blackouts, no petrol.<br> Its a mess.<br> Heath should resign now and make way<br> for someone whos not afraid to tackle the unions.<br> I swear, its all gone completely<br> out of my head.<br> My driving instructor thinks I should pass<br> but I feel as if Ive hardly had any lessons.<br> Ridiculous isnt it?<br> Maybe third time lucky.<br> Right.<br> The only thing you should remember is<br> that everyone else is either reckless or inept.<br> And often both.<br> One must be brave if one is to<br> take the wheel-<br> Right-o.<br> Move over... Move to your right a<br> little bit...<br> But if I move to the right arent<br> I on the wrong side of the road?<br> Well hes in the way!<br> - To the right. Move to the right!<br> So sorry! Terribly sorry!<br> Hey, look at me, driving!<br> Thanks Ma, that was terrific! I<br> really feel Ive got a handle on it now.<br> You should have seen us, Pa.<br> Have you been trying to make<br> breakfast? For Goodness sake, Denis!<br> I can boil a bloody egg.<br> Mummy took me for a test drive -<br> We went absolutely everywhere.<br> All over the place -<br> Ive decided. Im going to run.<br> What for?<br> Im going to run for Leader of the Party.<br> Silly me!<br> - Good luck!<br> All the time I thought I was having a driving lesson,<br> it was all about my mother, just for a change!<br> Whats she on about?<br> Its her driving test this morning!<br> - Oh, right. Of course.<br> Are you saying you want to be<br> Prime Minister?<br> What Im saying is that someone<br> must force the point,<br> say the unsayable. None of these<br> men have the guts.<br> The Prime Minister has been very<br> loyal to you, MT.<br> But hes weak, and hes<br> weakened the party.<br> One must know when to go.<br> Youre shaking.<br> Let... xxx<br> - I can do it!<br> Goodness me!<br> What is the matter<br> with everyone this morning?<br> Ive told you what the matter is.<br> The business is a bit rocky at the moment<br> and the Doctor thinks I need a rest.<br> And do you need a rest?<br> We both know...<br> that its highly unlikely that I<br> would ever be elected leader,<br> But I will run. I will run.<br> Just to nip at their heels and make...<br> them reaffirm the principles on which<br> the Conservative Party must stand.<br> Theres so much to do.<br> Youre insufferable, Margaret,<br> do you know that?<br> Denis, you married someone who is committed<br> to public service, you knew that.<br> And it is my duty...<br> - Dont call it duty.<br> Its ambition which has got<br> you this far. Ambition.<br> And the rest of us, me, the children,<br> we can all go to hell!<br> Dont worry about me,<br> Ill be fine!<br> Where did you go?<br> South Africa.<br> - Yes.Yes.<br> How many days passed before<br> you realized I was gone?<br> Probably had to ask the cleaning<br> woman where I was.<br> When did I lose track of everyone?<br> Too busy climbing the greasy pole MT.<br> Mrs Thatcher I understand you<br> recently visited the United States of America.<br> What was it you took away from that visit<br> which may be of value here in Great Britain?<br> Oh thats rather easy<br> to answer, actually.<br> They are unafraid of success.<br> We in Great Britain and in Europe<br> are formed mainly by our history.<br> They on the other hand are<br> formed by their philosophy.<br> Not by what has been,<br> but by what can be.<br> Oh, we have a great deal that we<br> can learn from them, yes. Oh yes!<br> For a start, that hat<br> has got to go.<br> And the pearls.<br> In fact I think all hats may have to go.<br> You look and sound like...<br> a privileged Conservative wife<br> and weve already got her vote.<br> Youve got lovely hair...<br> but we need to do something with it<br> to make it more, Important.<br> Yes. Give it more impact.<br> But the main thing is your voice.<br> Its too high. It has no authority.<br> Me thinks the Lady doth screech too much<br> People dont want to be harangued<br> by a woman or hectored.<br> Persuaded yes.<br> That oh yes...<br> at the end of the interview,<br> thats authoritative,<br> thats the voice of a leader.<br> Its all very well to talk about<br> changing my voice, Mr Reece,<br> but for some of my colleagues to<br> imagine me as their leader...<br> would be like imagining,<br> I dont know, being led into<br> battle by their chambermaid.<br> Its my background, and my sex.<br> No matter how Ive tried,<br> and I have tried...<br> to fit in, xxx<br> I will never be truly one of them.<br> If I may say so - I think thats<br> your trump card.<br> Youre flying in the face of everything<br> the Tories have been thus far.<br> Its really very exciting.<br> One simply has to maximise<br> your appeal...<br> bring out all your qualities...<br> and make you look, and sound,<br> like the leader that you could be.<br> Youve got it in you to go the<br> whole distance.<br> Absolutely.<br> Prime Minister?!<br> Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain?<br> There will be no female Prime Minister<br> here, not in my lifetime.<br> No.<br> And I told Airey, I dont expect<br> to win the leadership, but I...<br> am going to run.<br> Just to shake up the party.<br> Respectfully, Margaret,<br> I disagree.<br> If you want to change this party,<br> lead it. If you want to change<br> the country, lead it.<br> What were talking about here<br> today is surface.
