                        Over here.<br> Steve Martin's the name.<br> It grew.<br> Thank you. Tell you what I'll do.<br> You call out a tune, and I'll play it.<br> Stay in Your Own Backyard.<br> Too dirty back there.<br> - Any other tune?<br> - Banks of the Wabash.<br> Banks of the Wabash. All right.<br> Now I'll tell you what I'll do.<br> I'll play it if you folks will sing it. Right?<br> The key of C, Professor.<br> So you won't sing?<br> Am I asking you to do me a favor?<br> I'm doing you a favor.<br> When you sing, what happens?<br> Your lungs get full of oxygen.<br> It puts roses on your cheeks.<br> As a matter of fact, you either sing out,<br> or you get out.<br> Now that we understand each other,<br> let's go, Professor.<br> The breath of new-mown hay<br> Through the sycamores<br> the candle lights are gleaming<br> on the banks of the Wabash, far away<br> Fine. Stand up and let the folks see you.<br> Don't be bashful. Come on, stand right up.<br> Come on, folks, let's make him stand up.<br> Attaboy! Let's have it again.<br> Give that boy a spotlight!<br> Professor, let's have the chorus again.<br> Oh, the moonlight's fair tonight<br> along the Wabash<br> From the fields there comes the breath<br> of new-mown hay<br> Through the sycamores<br> the candle lights are gleaming<br> on the banks of the Wabash<br> far away<br> - What's your name?<br> - Asa Yoelson.<br> Are you in show business?<br> No, sir, I'm not.<br> Where'd you learn to sing like that?<br> I sing with my father at the synagogue.<br> - Where?<br> - At the...<br> The synagogue!<br> Wait a minute!<br> Sonny, wait a minute!<br> Answer me, Asa.<br> Where were you all that time?<br> You came like someone<br> who is running a race.<br> It's not good to run a race with God, Asa.<br> Where were you, Asa?<br> I was... singing.<br> You mean you stayed home?<br> - Practicing, is that what you mean?<br> - No.<br> Then where were you singing?<br> Stop cracking your knuckles.<br> In the street, maybe?<br> That's not exactly where I was singing.<br> Singing prayers in the street.<br> - No, not exactly.<br> - Exactly?<br> You must have been exactly somewhere...<br> singing exactly something...<br> - and for some exact reason.<br> - Yes, Papa.<br> My name is Martin.<br> I'd like to talk to you for a minute.<br> Hello, Asa.<br> You're Cantor Yoelson. I'm Steve Martin.<br> - How do you do?<br> - I'm glad to know you.<br> Your son has a real voice.<br> You were at the synagogue today<br> for the service?<br> Me? No. I just went by there to find out<br> where you lived.<br> Then where did you hear my son sing?<br> - At Kernan's.<br> - Kernan's?<br> Yeah. The burlesque house<br> a few blocks from here.<br> The burlesque theater?<br> - Don't you ever go there?<br> - No, I do not.<br> That boy's got a future in show business.<br> I've looked for something like him<br> for a long time.<br> I'd like to make him a regular part of the act.<br> You've nothing to worry about.<br> I'm booked solid for the season.<br> I move on to Baltimore tonight.<br> - Baltimore.<br> - I know he's pretty young...<br> but when a boy's got a voice like that,<br> he ought to let people hear it.<br> You're right, Mr. Martin. Asa will sing.<br> But where his people have always sung.<br> I know how you feel.<br> It's a beautiful thing to sing in church,<br> but there's a lot to say for the theater, too.<br> If you're worried<br> about my taking care of him...<br> Excuse me, Mr. Martin.<br> I think I know what's best for my son.<br> I was afraid that's how you'd feel about it.<br> Sorry, Asa.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> I want your promise<br> that you'll never go to that place again.<br> I can't.<br> - I can't promise.<br> - Go to your room.<br> Ann, go downstairs and get a ladder.<br> Put it here.<br> - Why?<br> - Hurry up. Get the ladder.<br> What'd you bring me here for?<br> Why don't you let me find Steve Martin?<br> What kind of a car was that<br> you jumped out of?<br> A cattle car.<br> What difference does that make?<br> All the difference in the world, my boy.<br> - Here's another one, Father.<br> - Let me go.<br> Yes, let him go, Riley. Don't mind him.<br> He just thinks he has to behave<br> like a policeman.<br> I don't think he understands boys.<br> No? I've only got seven of them myself.<br> That's just what I mean.<br> Now, suppose you tell me about yourself.<br> Where are you from?<br> - Where was he picked up?<br> - In the freight yard.<br> He came in on a cattle car. Can't you tell?<br> If you knew about freight trains,<br> you'd never pick a cattle car.<br> - I had to get here.<br> - To Baltimore? Why?<br> - He's got a job here.<br> - What kind of job?<br> - Singing.<br> - Singing? Where?<br> In a show with Steve Martin.<br> He's in Baltimore right now.<br> What about your family?<br> Do they know about this?<br> I see.<br> Before we do anything else,<br> I think you'd better have a hot bath.<br> - And something to eat, John.<br> - Come on, my boy.<br> Why don't you find Steve Martin<br> and ask him?<br> That's just what I'll do.<br> Since it's singing he's interested in,<br> why not let him sing?<br> Sing?<br> Tell me a little more about your work<br> in the theater, Mr. Martin.<br> I've told you about all there is.<br> Pardon me, Father. I don't get it.<br> Why would you be bringing me here,<br> asking me all these questions?<br> - Is there something you want me to do?<br> - I'll come to the point in a little while.<br> - Cantor Yoelson? I'm Father McGee.<br> - How do you do?<br> Mrs. Yoelson.<br> Hello, glad to see you again.<br> - You know Mr. Martin?<br> - We know him.<br> - Is our boy here?<br> - The description is like Asa.<br> I have a very strong feeling that...<br> So have I.<br> Singing without his cap on.<br> It's not so much what's on the head<br> as what's in the heart...<br> is it, Cantor?<br> Hello, Mama. Hello, Papa.<br> Beautiful song, wasn't it?<br> Get ready, Asa. We're going home.<br> I'll do it again, Papa. I'll run away.<br> - I'll find Mr. Martin someplace.<br> - Now wait, Asa.<br> I wouldn't have you in the act<br> if I didn't have your father's consent.<br> Then I'll get in another act.<br> I'll keep running away.<br> - What are we going to do with him?<br> - We'll decide that at home.<br> Maybe we should decide now, Papa.<br> You said you would take<br> very good care of our boy?<br> - You would consider this foolishness?<br> - I'm only asking, Papa.<br> If Asa is going to keep running away,<br> I have a right to ask.<br> I made inquiries about Mr. Martin.<br> He's a man who can be trusted.<br> I'm sorry I started all this trouble<br> and I wouldn't have more to do with it...<br> but considering his feelings<br> about show business...<br> Show business!<br> Tell me, Mr. Martin,<br> exactly what would Asa do?<br> The same as I did at Kernan's, Mama.<br> - Isn't that what you mean, Mr. Martin?<br> - Yes.<br> Mr. Martin's onstage asking everybody<br> to sing, but nobody does...<br> 'cause they're waiting<br> for someone else to begin.<br> I'm up in the balcony, and Mr. Martin says:<br> "Come on, folks! Join in the chorus!"<br> "Don't be bashful. All together now."<br> All of a sudden,<br> I stand up in the balcony and start singing.<br> I'm dumbfounded at the kid's voice,<br> and I say:<br> "Give that boy a spotlight!"<br> "Give that boy a spotlight!"<br> I love you<br> as I've never loved before<br> Since first I met you<br> on the village green<br> Come to me<br> or my dream of love<br> is over<br> I love you as I loved you<br> when you were sweet<br> when you were sweet<br> sixteen<br> "Next week, Philadelphia, then Pittsburgh.<br> "Feeling fine.<br> Your loving son, Asa Yoelson."<br> He's feeling fine.<br> Philadelphia, Pittsburgh.<br> Washington was too small for Asa.<br> - "Indianapolis."<br> - Indians! He'll come home scalped yet.<br> "Kickabock."<br> - Is this in the United States, Papa?<br> - Don't be foolish!<br> - No. That's pronounced Di-bi-kah.<br> - Dubuque!<br> Anyway, in Dubuque, he sang two encores.<br> Now spell "tedious."<br> T-E-D-O...<br> Wait a minute. That's wrong.<br> Try again. "Tedious."<br> You wouldn't know to spell it<br> if you didn't have that book.<br> I'm not learning. I'm teaching.<br> By the light<br> of the silvery moon, moon<br> I want to spoon<br> to my honey I'll croon love's tune<br> Honey moon<br> keep a-shinin' in June<br> Your silv'ry beams will bring love dreams<br> We'll be cuddling soon<br> by the silvery moon<br> Just a minute.<br> How come suddenly<br> in the middle of the song...<br> you put in a "moo-moo"?<br> I thought it would be a little better that way.<br> You thought it would be a little better?<br> If the guy who wrote the song<br> wanted to say "moo-moo"...<br> he'd write it that way.<br> I just get tired of singing it<br> the same way every time.<br> - So you thought up "moo-moo"?<br> - I didn't think it. It just came out.<br> It just came out?<br> Don't let it come out!<br> Sing that song just like it's written...<br> and I don't want to hear<br> no more "moo-moos."<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - How do you like that?<br> He gets tired singing it the same way...<br> so he puts in "moo-moo."<br> As if that makes any difference.<br> And another thing...<br> you're singing it a little faster every night.<br> Is that because you're tired, too?<br> No. That's because you're playing it<br> too slow.<br> I'm playing it slow?<br> Excuse me.<br> I've only been in this business for 30 years,<br> making a very nice living.<br> But maybe an old trouper like you<br> ought to come on stage...<br> I thought of that.<br> I could sing much better on the stage.<br> You don't tell me.<br> Then I can sing right to them<br> instead of the backs of their heads...<br> - and I could see how their faces look.<br> - The faces?<br> Unless you can see the people's faces,<br> it's no good at all.<br> You don't say. And tell me, Mr. Yoelson...<br> with that spotlight<br> shining right in your eyes...<br> - how are you gonna see faces?<br> - That's easy.<br> If you turn up all the lights in the theater,<br> then they can see me, and I can see them.<br> Asa in long pants.<br> Goodbye, my bluebell<br> farewell to you<br> One last fond look<br> into your eyes so blue<br> 'Mid campfires gleaming<br> 'mid shot and shell<br> Goodbye<br> - You don't wanna be in the act anymore?<br> - No, Steve.<br> I'm going home.<br> Don't be silly.<br> Your voice is changing, that's all.<br> In a couple of years,<br> you'll get it back, better than ever.<br> And listen, the way<br> you pulled that whistle out of the hat...<br> that's showmanship.<br> Didn't you hear them applaud?<br> - But it isn't the same.<br> - What isn't the same?<br> The act's just as good as it was before.<br> When you whistle,<br> their faces don't look the same.<br> Faces again. This kid'll drive me crazy.<br> Listen, I didn't say you're gonna whistle<br> the rest of your life.<br> Just for a while.<br> Look, know what we're gonna do?<br> We're gonna work up<br> some whistling routines...<br> and you're gonna<br> work on the stage with me.<br> What do you think of that?<br> And do you know something else?<br> Then you're gonna get billing.<br> Yes, sir!<br> "Meet that scintillating team of artists:<br> Steve Martin and Asa Yoelson."<br> Asa Yoelson.<br> "Now I whistle in the act.<br> Everyone seems to like it.<br> "Your loving son..."<br> - Papa, Asa isn't Asa anymore!<br> - What?<br> In Reno, Papa, he's picking up time.<br> Is time something you can pick up?<br> This is crazy.<br> This town they liked so much,<br> they named it twice.<br> He says he can't come home this summer.<br> Maybe next spring.<br> Since first I met you<br> on the village green<br> - Listen.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Come to me<br> for my dream of love<br> is all<br> I love you as I loved you<br> When you were sweet<br> When you were sweet<br> sixteen<br> What do you think?<br> Are we going into this again<br> in the middle of the night?<br> - It's getting better every time.<br> - All right, it's getting better.<br> I told you, let it alone. Give yourself time.<br> - Go away. Go sing in the bathroom.<br> - Why not let me try?<br> You mean all of a sudden,<br> tomorrow maybe...<br> - in the middle of the act, you wanna sing?<br> - Why not?<br> - You're daffy.<br> - Why?<br> We're changing no act<br> in the middle of the season...<br> and fall flat on our face.<br> We're gonna do like I said.<br> We're gonna knock off a month next spring.<br> Won't take no. Never stops.<br> This guy'll drive me crazy.<br> He's getting close to home.<br> We'll see him soon, Papa.<br> - Hello, Pop. How's tricks?<br> - Letter for you.<br> Mama. Always on time.<br> - Overture!<br> - Come on, Al.<br> Mama's excited.<br> Three more weeks, and we go home.<br> - I could use a nice month's rest.<br> - Not a month.<br> I don't want to stay home that long.<br> Just a few days.<br> We have to work on the new act<br> and the stuff I'll sing.<br> I know. There'll be time.<br> Take it easy. Just relax.<br> - Stop arguing.<br> - Just humming a little.<br> When you sing,<br> it means you're getting ideas.<br> I was thinking of something.<br> In Nashville and Charleston,<br> the last two dates...<br> why can't I sing just one chorus<br> of Sweet Sixteen?<br> - No.<br> - Just to see how it sounds.<br> Won't matter if I flop.<br> Just in Charleston, then.<br> Let me sing it once the last night.<br> That little Connolly kid<br> is awful sweet on you.<br> Give her a tumble<br> and get your mind on something else.<br> - Don't you think of girls?<br> - I haven't got time.<br> All I'm asking is just one chance. That's all...<br> Stop arguing!<br> I bet the Kentucky Derby winner.<br> I win a snootful!<br> A snootful is right. You better get ready.<br> I got ready, boy, and I win!<br> Get yourself together.<br> You're on in a little while.<br> - I'll be there with flying colors.<br> - He can't go on like that.<br> We better tell Jonesy to skip the act,<br> and get ready ourselves.<br> You get made up.<br> - I gotta try and pull this guy together.<br> - All right, but hurry up.<br> There's a big derby crowd out there tonight.<br> The house is packed. You gotta go on.<br> I'm raring to go.<br> Oscar Hammerstein and Lew Dockstader!<br> What are they doing here?<br> Down for the races.<br> Why did you drag me here<br> when we could've been playing poker?<br> Anything on a stage, Oscar, and I love it.<br> I see them all.<br> - You're on, Mr. Baron.<br> - Ready.<br> Anytime you're ready to go, Lew.<br> Tom, you're all right? Where's Al?<br> He was with you, wasn't he?<br> Where did he go?<br> All right, Tom.<br> Tom, come on, get out there. Hurry up!<br> There's a little bunch of sweetness<br> that I long to call my bride<br> And believe me, I'm not happy<br> But, baby<br> Funny thing,<br> I've sung this song a thousand times...<br> Why I forgot it tonight, I don't know.<br> You'll hear me call her name<br> I got it now.<br> Rosie, you are my posie<br> You are my heart's bouquet<br> Come out here in the moonlight<br> There's something sweet love, I want to say<br> Your honey boy, I'm waiting<br> Those ruby lips to greet<br> Don't be so aggravating<br> Baron's developed a very nice style.<br> Very nice.<br> Rosie<br> you are my posie<br> You are my heart's bouquet<br> Come out here in the moonlight<br> there's something sweet love<br> I'm gonna sing about my baby, your honey<br> Your boy, I'm waiting<br> Those ruby, those lips to greet<br> Don't be so aggravating<br> My blushin' Rosie<br> my posie sweet!<br> Did you hear that finish?<br> Come on, Tom. Get out there!<br> I don't know any more of Tom's songs.<br> Take a bow and collapse.<br> Get yourself off! Go on!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - He's sick.<br> - Let me help you.<br> - I'll take him back.<br> Jimmy, get the adagio team. Hurry up!<br> I'll murder you!<br> Give me that key to Baron's room.<br> He could get thrown out.<br> But the way I sang that finish.<br> Give me that key.<br> We gotta get Tom on his feet.<br> Get that make up off and you get yours on.<br> The stage manager<br> will be here to see if you died.<br> - I gotta go on!<br> - Get this through your head.<br> You've been on. You just came off.<br> - You got sick and quit after the first song.<br> - I did?<br> Don't you understand?<br> You weren't on at all. You couldn't make it.<br> - That idiot went on and sang for you.<br> - You were a big hit, Tom.<br> I'll talk to you later. Get that makeup off.<br> He's all right, Jonesy.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> Mr. Hammerstein and Mr. Dockstader<br> are here to see him.<br> Hammerstein? Dockstader?<br> - What's the matter? Let me in!<br> - Just a minute!<br> Are you all right?<br> Did you hear what I told you?<br> - See, you were a big hit.<br> - Keep still.<br> Come in, gentlemen.<br> He's feeling much better.<br> Just a little indigestion.<br> Mr. Baron, gentlemen.<br> Mr. Dockstader, Mr. Hammerstein.<br> I'm glad to know you.<br> You were great out there tonight.<br> - Sorry you couldn't do more.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Hammerstein.<br> This is Steve Martin, gentlemen.<br> How are you? My partner, Al Jolson.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Martin and Jolson.<br> I have an idea you might do very well<br> at Hammerstein's Victoria...<br> if you'd consider opening in two weeks?<br> I don't know, Mr. Hammerstein.<br> That's wonderful. He gets an offer<br> to play on Broadway and he doesn't know.<br> That's a great break.<br> I don't carry a contract around with me,<br> but anything will do.<br> - I'd like to talk to you.<br> - Who me?<br> Outside.<br> I'm certain we won't have any trouble<br> about the terms.<br> Yes, sir, you're going to enjoy<br> playing my theater.<br> What did you say your name was?<br> Al Jolson.<br> - Did you ever sing in blackface?<br> - Him? Never.<br> You see, he just whistles, Mr. Dockstader.<br> Blacks up behind the ears to whistle.<br> I've seen Baron work before.<br> Hammerstein hasn't.<br> - I'll go and explain to Mr. Hammerstein.<br> - I wouldn't.<br> Hammerstein knows what he's doing.<br> I don't tell tales.<br> As for you, Jolson...<br> you can join Dockstader's Minstrels<br> in St. Louis next week.<br> You don't mean it.<br> - You hear that?<br> - That's from heaven!<br> St. Louis next week.<br> We'd have to leave the show on Saturday.<br> We can fix that, can't we?<br> Sure. There's a lot of new stuff<br> we're planning to put in the act.<br> - We'll have it ready Saturday.<br> - I can't use an act.<br> I only have a place for one man.<br> You mean you just want me?<br> What did you think?<br> What would I be doing with minstrels?<br> Steve and I have been together a long time<br> and we're working up a lot of new ideas.<br> Not me. You.<br> But this is what a guy like you prays for.<br> - Dockstader's Minstrels in one jump.<br> - Where you can sing your head off.<br> You mean the job calls for a singer?<br> What are you talking about?<br> What did you think?<br> Then I wouldn't be interested.<br> See, I like whistling.<br> Steve and I argue about that all the time.<br> He wants me to sing...<br> but at heart I'm a whistler.<br> It makes me happy.<br> - Martin and Jolson, five minutes.<br> - That's us.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> If you need a whistler, let me know.<br> Be with you in a minute, Steve.<br> When are you leaving town, Mr. Dockstader?<br> Tomorrow evening.<br> I might drop around to your hotel<br> in the morning.<br> I wonder what the porter did<br> with my bags. They're not here.<br> - Must be on the train somewhere.<br> - I'll see.<br> Hello, Jolson.<br> Hello, Mr. Dockstader.<br> I thought you were going to St. Louis.<br> I am. So are you.<br> - All aboard!<br> - Where's Steve?<br> He's not coming.<br> - Then I'm on the wrong train.<br> - No, you're not! This is the right train.<br> Steve wants you to go with me.<br> - I can't do it, Mr. Dockstader.<br> - But you're throwing away a great chance.<br> I want a girl<br> Just like the girl<br> That married dear old Dad<br> She was a pearl<br> And the only girl<br> That Daddy ever had<br> A good old-fashioned girl with heart so true<br> One who loves nobody else but you<br> And that's why I want a girl<br> Just like the girl<br> That married dear old Dad<br> Excuse me, Mr. Dockstader.<br> - It's been almost a year now...<br> - And you're doing fine.<br> You're making real progress<br> and I have some ideas for you.<br> I'm going to move you into a quartet.<br> Thanks a lot, Mr. Dockstader,<br> but you see, I had some ideas myself...<br> Steve Martin said<br> you break out with a rash now and then.<br> Ideas about what?<br> I wanted to talk to you<br> about the kind of song we're singing.<br> - Same one always in the same way...<br> - That's what they come to hear.<br> - It's tradition.<br> - But they might like something different.<br> My boy, minstrels have been doing fine<br> for 50 years.<br> We take pride in doing it<br> like it's always been done.<br> - I know that...<br> - But you've got a great point there.<br> We'll talk it over sometime.<br> She was a pearl and the only girl<br> That Daddy ever had<br> A good old-fashioned girl with heart so true<br> One who loves nobody else but you<br> Excuse me, Mr. Dockstader.<br> - I've been looking for a chance for weeks...<br> - I agree.<br> You've worked in that quartet long enough.<br> Time you moved up.<br> - I'm going to give you a chance in a duet.<br> - That'd be fine, Mr. Dockstader...<br> but the point is, if I do,<br> I'd like to try a different kind of song.<br> I mean something with a style<br> that's better for me...<br> faster tempo, more rhythm.<br> I'd like to look for something like that.<br> Sure. Talk to you about that again.<br> Must be some song around<br> you'd be happy with.<br> I want a girl, just like the girl<br> That married dear old Dad<br> She was a pearl and the only girl<br> That Daddy ever had<br> - Where you going to eat?<br> - I think I'll take a look at the town.<br> - I've never been in New Orleans before.<br> - Don't get lost. We've got a show tonight.<br> Mr. Dockstader,<br> Jolson hasn't showed up yet.<br> It's too late now anyway. Cut the duet.<br> I'm sorry I'm late...<br> It's intermission.<br> We had to skip your number.<br> I'm very sorry.<br> I just forgot.<br> I know that sounds crazy,<br> but I heard some music tonight...<br> something they call "jazz."<br> Some fellas just make it up<br> as they go along. They pick it out of the air.<br> They tell me they play it<br> for weddings, funerals...<br> Funerals?<br> Don't get the wrong idea.<br> You've never heard anything like this.<br> I sang with them. Nothing with words,<br> because the song doesn't have any.<br> In fact, it isn't even a song.<br> But you can make it one<br> and get words to fit.<br> It just needs to be worked on a little.<br> It's exciting.<br> It'll make the show a hundred times better.<br> I'm happy with the show as it is.<br> But you aren't, are you?<br> In fact, you never will be.<br> You'll always be chasing something<br> up ahead...<br> and keep forgetting your act<br> in a little thing like a minstrel show.<br> So, maybe, we ought to call it quits.<br> Don't you think so?<br> Yeah, I think you're right.<br> Good luck, Jolson.<br> I hope you find what you are looking for.<br> Thanks, Mr. Dockstader.<br> Papa, you're not<br> going to start again tonight?<br> Can't a man ask himself questions?<br> In six months, three cards.<br> I would really like to understand.<br> He leaves Dockstader<br> and then no cards. Why?<br> Because he did not leave Dockstader<br> for a better position...<br> because, for a long time, he isn't working.<br> Excuse me, are you the Yoelsons<br> who have a talented son in show business?<br> Yup, it's the right Yoelsons.<br> Mama, you got younger.<br> - Why didn't you say you were coming?<br> - Isn't this better?<br> - This way Mama's having a good cry.<br> - How are you?<br> - Look at him, a man.<br> - Did you eat, Asa?<br> - Eat? What's that?<br> - Mama, he didn't eat!<br> Come on, sit down. Papa and I just finished,<br> but there's plenty. I got everything.<br> I got to tell Ann!<br> Sit down. Make him sit down, Papa.<br> Ann Murray!<br> Why is she so excited?<br> What's there to be so excited about?<br> Mama takes all the medals.<br> Still the best cook in the United States.<br> After what you've been eating,<br> by comparison I'm wonderful.<br> Look at him. Shows you what you can tell<br> from pictures. He is skin and bones.<br> You see...<br> That's nice, to put a cap on when you eat.<br> But, Asa...<br> did you wear one all the time<br> you were away?<br> - As a matter of fact, I didn't.<br> - For me, it's not necessary.<br> - Gefilte fish I made this morning.<br> - And horseradish, fresh-grated an hour ago.<br> Look out for it, Asa. It's very strong.<br> Who's that again? Not Ann Murray?<br> Of course. She grew up.<br> And look how pretty.<br> That's what I mean. It can't be.<br> She was just a funny little girl<br> with funny ribbons in her hair.<br> Listen to that, Mama.<br> And you were such a prize, I suppose?<br> - Asa was a beautiful boy.<br> - You see?<br> - Let him eat. The fish.<br> - I can taste this already.<br> - Not too much horseradish.<br> - I don't have to worry about...<br> Magnificent.<br> See? I knew he would like it.<br> Wonderful, Mama.<br> Really, the best you ever made.<br> Mama, you're terrific.<br> - Tell me, Papa, how's everybody been?<br> - Mama and I have been well.<br> By the way, do you know who came<br> to see us a few weeks ago? Steve Martin.<br> - How is he?<br> - I don't know.<br> He didn't look so well.<br> He said he was picking up time.<br> - Is that good?<br> - Lf you don't have a regular booking...<br> that means you're picking up<br> whatever work you can get.<br> - And you...<br> - Papa, please, he's eating.<br> - You can talk business later.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> It's all right, Mama.<br> It's true. I've been picking up a little time<br> now and then.<br> - You see...<br> - But wait.<br> I'd have had regular booking<br> if I'd wanted it. But I've had other ideas.<br> They sound a little crazy to anyone but me.<br> Like what, Asa?<br> Like spending most of my time<br> in hotel rooms with songwriters...<br> whenever I met up with one...<br> trying to make songs out of music<br> I picked up.<br> Music nobody ever heard of before,<br> but the only kind I want to sing.<br> Is this music so peculiar?<br> You sing it all the time, Papa.<br> - You want to sing prayers on the stage?<br> - No, just the feeling in prayers.<br> That's what's in the people I got it from...<br> and that's what's in their music,<br> even when it's fast and happy.<br> But they tell me it won't go, Papa.<br> It's never been done.<br> In fact, I'll tell you a secret.<br> They say your son's a little crazy.<br> Mama, our son is a little crazy.<br> But what can we do? He is our boy.<br> We have got to love him.<br> But about crazy people, Asa...<br> it's very funny.<br> See, once they prove they are right,<br> they are suddenly great people.<br> I'll go. Eat, Asa.<br> Hello. Yes?<br> New York?<br> Hello. Yes?<br> Who?<br> Al?<br> Asa? He is right here.<br> Yes, and who is this, please?<br> Baron?<br> A Mr. Tom Baron.<br> Hello, Tom? How are you?<br> Where'd you drop from?<br> How'd you know I was here?<br> I got your home address from an agency.<br> It's about this, Al.<br> You remember that contract<br> with Hammerstein?<br> I was so bad that he paid me off<br> if I'd stop singing.<br> That's how it happens I'm managing<br> the new Winter Garden Theatre.<br> I got you to thank for the whole thing.<br> Look, my friend, we open in three weeks.<br> There's a spot in the show for you,<br> if you want it.<br> If I want it?<br> Winter Garden?<br> Yes, I heard you, Tom. It's just a spot...<br> but Broadway.<br> Except, tell me, Tom, what do I do?<br> - I mean, exactly what do I sing?<br> - I don't know.<br> Any one of the songs<br> that's been written for the show.<br> Why can't I pick my own, Tom?<br> Not exactly my own.<br> It's stuff I picked up. Terrific songs.<br> They need to be polished up<br> by someone good. Won't take much time.<br> They're terrific, but not written yet?<br> What's the good, if it won't help the show<br> and I can't do what I can?<br> I don't care if it's the biggest show,<br> I rather pass it up.<br> Let me bring the stuff on<br> and help me get it into shape.<br> You will? You're marvelous.<br> I can leave right away.<br> I'll be on that train in an hour.<br> - He just came home.<br> - Right, Tom, the minute I get there.<br> - Asa, you are leaving?<br> - Just right next door, New York. I'll be back.<br> Honey, what a break this is.<br> New York, Broadway,<br> Winter Garden, here I come.<br> How do you like that?<br> It's got to be his own song...<br> - and his own way of singing it.<br> - Hasn't changed a day.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> Don't tell him I had anything to do with it.<br> This could turn out to be a pack of trouble.<br> Al? Trouble? I can't imagine what you mean.<br> Show's running too long.<br> It's almost 11:00 p.m.<br> - Who's on next?<br> - Jolson.<br> - Cut him and jump to the finish.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Tell the orchestra leader about it.<br> Look, I want to go on.<br> Where's Baron? Ask Tom.<br> Baron isn't running this end of it. I am.<br> - Hold it. You're not on.<br> - That's what you think.<br> We're cutting the Jolson number.<br> I'm next, folks.<br> - You lucky people.<br> - But he's here, in front of me.<br> Oscar, what are you doing with that phone?<br> This is no time to call up women.<br> - I can't get up there and pull him off.<br> - Close the curtains on him.<br> Oscar, if you insist on phoning,<br> get one for me.<br> Hello, Oscar, remember me? Jolson.<br> Now, boys, take it easy.<br> Next they'll turn out the lights on me,<br> but I wouldn't mind that.<br> Professor, my song, if you please.<br> Settle back, folks.<br> You ain't heard nothing yet.<br> Everything seems lovely<br> when you start to roam<br> The birds are singing the day that you stray<br> But wait until you are further away<br> Things won't be so lovely<br> When you're all alone<br> Here's what you'll keep saying<br> when you're far from home<br> Mammy<br> Mammy<br> The sun shines east, the sun shines west<br> I know where the sun shines best<br> Mammy<br> My little mammy<br> My heartstrings<br> are tangled around Alabamy<br> I'm a-comin'<br> Sorry that I made you wait<br> I'm a-comin'<br> Hope and trust that I'm not late<br> Mammy<br> My little mammy<br> I'd walk a million miles<br> For one of your smiles<br> My mammy<br> Mammy<br> My little mammy<br> The sun shines east, the sun shines west<br> I know where the sun shines best<br> It's on my mammy I'm talking about<br> Nobody else's, my little mammy<br> My heartstrings are tangled around<br> Alabamy<br> Mammy<br> Mammy, I'm comin'<br> I hope I didn't make you wait<br> Mammy, I'm coming<br> I hope I'm not late<br> Mammy, look at me<br> Don't you know me? I'm your little baby<br> I'd walk a million miles<br> for one of your smiles<br> My mammy<br> Asa smashed something?<br> That actor you wanted to interview<br> for the new show...<br> - want to see him now?<br> - Send him in.<br> Hello, Steve. Haven't seen you<br> in a long time. How have you been?<br> Fine. Glad to see you, Al.<br> Sit down. Just cleaning up.<br> Look, about this part, Al.<br> It's nice of you to think of me,<br> but it might not be right.<br> - I'm considering a few other things...<br> - Sure, I realize that.<br> But it's like this. I've clicked on Broadway<br> and things are piling up on me.<br> Music contracts, record-making,<br> sheet music.<br> Now we're putting together a new show<br> starring Al.<br> It's a great show.<br> You should hear the songs.<br> - We go into rehearsal next week.<br> - But what's this got to do with the part?<br> I'm telling you the part.<br> I need a man who knows show business.<br> I need a man to move in<br> and help me run my career.<br> I need a manager. What do you say?<br> It's a nice part, Mr. Jolson,<br> but not in my line.<br> You old dog, you got to do it.<br> I need you, been looking all over for you.<br> Quit kidding. You got Tom.<br> I have to run the shows.<br> Somebody's got to run Al.<br> - Come on, say you'll ride along with me.<br> - At my age, ride on a comet?<br> Tom, meet my new manager,<br> Mr. Steve Martin.<br> Great pleasure, Mr. Martin.<br> Great pleasure, Mr. Martin.<br> And I'm sittin' on top of the world<br> I'm rollin' along<br> Just rollin' along<br> Don't want any millions<br> I'm getting my share<br> I've only got one suit<br> just one, that's all I can wear<br> A bundle of money don't make me feel gay<br> A sweet little honey<br> is making me say<br> I'm sittin', sittin' on top<br> Top of the world<br> I'm rollin' along<br> Just rollin' along<br> And I'm quittin' the blues of the world<br> I'm singin' a song, just singin' a song<br> Glory Hallelujah, I just phoned the parson<br> Hey, Par, get ready to call<br> Just like Humpty Dumpty<br> I'm going to fall<br> And I'm sittin', sittin' on top<br> Top of the world<br> I'm rollin' along<br> Rollin' along<br> - The show isn't over yet, that's all.<br> - So what are you worried about?<br> Mama, when will you learn<br> about show business?<br> Running time is everything.<br> You can have a smash show,<br> but if it's too long, it can take a nosedive.<br> It happens all the time.<br> What's the matter, Miss Sally?<br> Just tell your old Uncle Gus everything.<br> It can't be as bad as all that.<br> Henry will never believe I love him<br> and not Lester.<br> Why don't you just explain it to Henry?<br> He won't even listen to me.<br> - He won't?<br> - No.<br> Honey, Henry better listen pretty soon<br> or this show's going to run till 1:00.<br> A lot of these folks live in Brooklyn.<br> They got to catch a train.<br> He really loves her and she really loves him,<br> and it comes out all right anyway.<br> Henry, please come here and tell her<br> you love her so we can get to the finale?<br> Come on, Henry. Come on out.<br> You remember Henry.<br> Go ahead, kids, do your stuff.<br> That's enough. Besides, you're getting paid.<br> Now that we got that set,<br> take this curtain up.<br> Has he lost his mind?<br> Go ahead, take it up.<br> Hello, kids, how are you?<br> Wait a minute. Hold it. Don't go.<br> Don't mind the customers. Do like I tell you.<br> Everybody, come back and sit down.<br> Anyway, kids, you're tired...<br> and this may go on for a long time.<br> Because I got another dozen songs in me<br> and I'm raring to go.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I've made up my mind.<br> If I'm going to sing to you,<br> I want to see you.<br> Steve, tell the electricians<br> to turn up the lights.<br> Go ahead.<br> All the houselights. Every one of them.<br> Houselights? Why?<br> How else you going to see faces?<br> That's more like it.<br> I've been waiting for this a long time.<br> I've been waiting for this a long time.<br> Professor, You Made Me Love You.<br> And if that ain't a song cue,<br> I never heard one.<br> You made me love you<br> I didn't wanna do it<br> I didn't wanna do it<br> You made me want to<br> And all the time you knew it<br> I guess you always knew it<br> You made me happy sometimes<br> You made me glad<br> But there were times, baby<br> You dog<br> You made me cry for<br> I didn't wanna tell you<br> I didn't wanna tell you<br> I want some love that's true<br> You know I do, indeed I do, yes, I do<br> Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme<br> what I cry for<br> You know you got the kind of kisses<br> that I'd die for<br> You know you made me love you<br> Beginning of the second year<br> and still socko, Mama.<br> I want to get past those footlights<br> and a lot closer to the audience.<br> I want a runway from the stage<br> running right down the center of the house.<br> Then I can sing right at them.<br> Put a thing like that up,<br> you lose 100 seats every performance.<br> And your show has twice as long a run,<br> a clear profit.<br> Look, right down here...<br> Swanee, how I love you, how I love you<br> My dear old Swanee<br> The folks up north will see me no more<br> when I get to that Swanee shore<br> I love the old folks at home<br> Swanee, how I love you, how I love you<br> My dear old Swanee<br> The folks up north will see me no more<br> When I get to that Swanee shore<br> "Robinson Crusoe, after two years,<br> still sockeroo."<br> What is "sockeroo," Papa?<br> Sockeroo, Mama? That's double socko.<br> Take a big Broadway show like this on tour?<br> Drag it all over the country into tank towns?<br> Al's out of his mind. It's never been done.<br> Neither was lighting up the audience,<br> or runways.<br> But why this, Steve?<br> Because it's a brand-new audience,<br> he says, millions of them.<br> People who never saw a Broadway show<br> and never heard him sing.<br> But you go ahead, Tom, talk him out of it.<br> I will.<br> Here's a laugh.<br> Some boys at the club were saying,<br> "Give Sunday night concerts...<br> "so actors and people in show business<br> can get a chance to see you perform."<br> How do you like that?<br> That's the most exciting audience<br> in the world.<br> That's a great idea.<br> Make a note of it, Steve.<br> Tell Tom to arrange it.<br> Wait. The minute we get back to New York...<br> you want to start to work on the new show,<br> without even a day's rest.<br> So what?<br> Soon, you're doing eight performances<br> a week again...<br> like you've done steady for five years.<br> And now you want to add<br> an extra show on Sunday.<br> That's a shortcut to the morgue.<br> Sweetheart, what you like doing<br> keeps you healthy.<br> I know you'd rather sing<br> to a live face than eat...<br> but I call this winding up<br> with nothing for yourself.<br> I'm talking about some life<br> outside of a theater.<br> Like what?<br> Like slowing down a little<br> and having some other kind of fun...<br> like a family, like some girl.<br> Don't worry, pal, there's always been a girl.<br> - Look, when do we play Washington?<br> - Two weeks.<br> The night we open there,<br> let's make it a real celebration.<br> Get a box for Mama and Papa,<br> Ann Murray and her folks...<br> and tell Papa to bring the president.<br> - Of the United States?<br> - No, the synagogue.<br> Hamburgers<br> Hamburgers<br> Hamburgers<br> List'n to me while I tell you<br> of the Spaniard who blighted me life<br> List'n to me while I tell you<br> of the man who stole my future wife<br> - 'Twas down at the bullfight we met him<br> - Yes! Yes!<br> - And during his daring display<br> - What then?<br> And while I went out<br> for some peanuts and a program<br> that dirty dog stole her away<br> - The pig!<br> - Oh, yes!<br> Oh, no!<br> - Oh, yes!<br> - Oh, no!<br> So tonight<br> I will have my revenge<br> Tonight he will have his revenge<br> If I catch Alphonso Spugoni<br> - the toreador<br> - He'll rue the day<br> With one mighty swipe<br> I will dislocate his bally jaw<br> He will, he will<br> I'll get him, the blighter, I will<br> and when I get him, that blighter I'll kill,<br> he shall die!<br> - He shall die<br> - He shall die<br> - He shall die<br> - He shall die<br> - He shall die<br> - I'll kill him<br> - He shall die<br> - I'll kill him dead<br> I'll raise a bunion on his Spanish onion<br> If I catch him bending tonight<br> - He shall die<br> - He shall die<br> - He shall die<br> - He shall die<br> He shall die<br> He shall jolly well die<br> - He shall die<br> - He shall die<br> He shall die<br> Oh, it's too high<br> One of us should have stayed home<br> For I'll raise a bunion on his Spanish onion<br> If I catch him bending tonight<br> A Spaniard all of sudden.<br> - Mr. And Mrs. Murray, glad you're here.<br> - You were great. I enjoyed it.<br> Mr. Samuels, how are you?<br> How'd you like it?<br> When I sing in the synagogue,<br> I never get applause like that.<br> Papa, if you want to get ahead singing,<br> you got to have Steve manage your affairs.<br> Asa, you look thin. You need a rest.<br> Rest? There's a new show coming up...<br> and now a performance every Sunday night.<br> - Sunday nights, too?<br> - By popular request. Don't worry about it.<br> - AI, it was marvelous.<br> - I'm glad to see you, Ann.<br> I know him.<br> That's Roy Anderson, Al.<br> He was in school with us.<br> - Sure, hello, Roy.<br> - How are you?<br> We're going to be married next month, Al.<br> You and Roy?<br> What do you know!<br> We've been experimenting with talking<br> pictures for years. We know it'll work.<br> But we want a star<br> in our first sound picture.<br> But why Al?<br> It's logical. He's the biggest singing star<br> and he's led the way ever since he began.<br> So Al should risk his career<br> on a newfangled invention like this.<br> - What if this thing is a flop?<br> - With Jolson, we don't think it will be.<br> Before Al goes into anything like this,<br> he's gonna knock off for a year and rest.<br> How many people do you figure<br> see a good movie?<br> Fifty million in this country alone.<br> The rest of the world besides.<br> Never was an audience like that in history.<br> - That may be true, Al, but...<br> - It's an audience that never saw a live show.<br> People in small towns can afford a movie<br> but can't afford anything else.<br> Audience of millions. Be singing<br> to every one of them at the same time.<br> - That's really something.<br> - Ready for the finale, Mr. Jolson.<br> Stick around, Mr. Glenn.<br> We'll talk about it later.<br> Pictures that talk?<br> - Is that possible, Papa?<br> - Certainly. It's a new invention.<br> But tell me, exactly, how does this work?<br> It's very complicated, Mama.<br> You wouldn't understand it.<br> Al, The Jazz Singer is all set. All that's<br> left to do is to make the announcement.<br> Al, there's your music.<br> Announcement? There's only one place<br> to make the announcement.<br> Hi, folks.<br> Hello, Jerry.<br> Show people are crazy.<br> Work in the theater all week.<br> Sundays, you come here.<br> I'm crazy, too.<br> Tonight, folks, I'm only gonna sing<br> I should live so long.<br> Hold this, will you, Henry?<br> Sorry I'm late, but we were discussing<br> a business deal in the back of the house.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I'm gonna tell you about it right now.<br> See, tomorrow I leave for Hollywood.<br> I'm going into<br> what they call "talking pictures."<br> Don't know what'll happen to me.<br> But if I wanna come back,<br> you'll let me, won't you?<br> Thanks, I'll remember that.<br> So this is a kind of a farewell.<br> If you don't mind,<br> I'll sing till you ask me to stop.<br> You ain't heard nothing yet.<br> Well, I see a rival producer<br> sitting down front.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> Ziggy, will you stand up and take a bow?<br> Try and stop him.<br> Not too much, folks.<br> Say, Ziggy, who's that pretty gal with you?<br> This is Julie Benson,<br> the star of my next production, Show Girl.<br> Mr. Ziegfeld, you will please<br> not advertise on my time.<br> Glad to know you, Miss Benson.<br> Look, I'm giving a little farewell party up<br> at my place tonight, Miss Benson.<br> I don't live very far from here.<br> You can bring Mr. Ziegfeld along.<br> - What'll it be?<br> - Swanee.<br> Wait a second. Hold it.<br> I don't care what you mugs want.<br> I want to know<br> what Miss Benson would like to hear.<br> Miss Benson, what is your pleasure?<br> April Showers.<br> Let's not keep the lady waiting, Henry.<br> Though April showers<br> may come your way<br> Just for you.<br> They bring the flowers that bloom in May<br> So if it's raining<br> have no regrets<br> because it isn't raining rain, you know<br> It's raining violets<br> And where you see clouds<br> upon the hills<br> you soon will see crowds<br> of daffodils<br> So keep on looking for a bluebird<br> And listening for its song<br> Whenever April showers<br> come along<br> Though April showers<br> may come your way<br> They bring the flowers<br> that bloom in May<br> So if it's raining<br> have no regrets<br> because it isn't raining rain, you know<br> It's raining violets<br> And where you see clouds<br> Where you see clouds on the hills<br> Look, look, they're not clouds, no, no<br> They're crowds of daffodils<br> So keep on looking for a bluebird<br> and listening<br> for its song<br> Whenever April showers<br> come along<br> Folks, I'm calling the next one.<br> I want to sing about<br> that big, beautiful state I'm going to.<br> And I don't mean Florida.<br> Hit it, Professor!<br> Hit it, Professor!<br> California, here I come<br> Right back where I started from<br> Where bowers of flowers<br> bloom in the spring<br> Each morning at dawning<br> birdies sing and everything<br> A sun-kissed miss said, "Don't be late"<br> That's why I can hardly wait<br> Open up that Golden Gate<br> California, here I come<br> California, here I come, yeah!<br> Right back where I started from<br> Where bowers of flowers<br> bloom in the spring<br> Each morning at dawning<br> birdies sing and everything<br> A sun-kissed miss said, "Don't be late"<br> That's why I can hardly wait<br> Come on, open up, open up, open up<br> that Golden Gate<br> California<br> Here I come<br> California, here I come, yeah!<br> Right back where I started from<br> Where bowers of flowers<br> bloom in the spring<br> Each morning at dawning<br> birdies sing and everything<br> A sun-kissed miss said, "Don't be late"<br> That's why I can hardly wait<br> Come on, open up, open up, open up<br> that Golden Gate<br> California<br> here I come<br> I'm afraid I'll have to talk to you, my friend.<br> - Please, Mr. Jolson, I'll never do it again.<br> - You sure?<br> A million imitators of Al Jolson,<br> but none of them touch the original.<br> That's a cute speech.<br> You know, I'd sort of like to touch you.<br> I don't know. It's funny.<br> I can't seem to make it.<br> That's good.<br> You know, you get prettier<br> every time I see you.<br> - The first time was just a few hours ago.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Then you got prettier since then.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Look, will you do me a big favor?<br> - What?<br> Will you marry me, Miss Benson?<br> I'll do you a bigger favor, Mr. Jolson.<br> I won't marry you.<br> I didn't suppose you would,<br> but you could think about it.<br> You'd have to decide tonight.<br> I'm going to California tomorrow.<br> - This last evening belongs to your friends.<br> - Wait. You mean in there?<br> Tell you a secret,<br> don't even know most of them.<br> How'd they get there?<br> It always seems to happen.<br> You see, I ask a few people up.<br> Then they ask some people<br> I never heard of...<br> and those strangers ask some<br> other strangers and before you know it...<br> - You're singing for them.<br> - Yeah, just for three or four hours.<br> You work till midnight and then you come<br> home and work three or four hours more?<br> I don't mind.<br> - You mean you love it.<br> - Yeah, I guess I do.<br> It's more than just singing.<br> I don't know how to tell you...<br> - You really don't have to, Mr. Jolson.<br> - Yes, I do.<br> I gotta tell you everything.<br> - AI, it's getting late and the gang wants...<br> - Go away, Steve, I'm busy.<br> Caught a cold. Can't sing a note. Go away.<br> You really ought to go in, Mr. Jolson.<br> No, I've got to tell you how I feel.<br> And it's gonna take me hours.<br> I shouldn't be rushing you like this.<br> You'll think I'm kidding.<br> But look, you see, I've been waiting<br> for something for a long time.<br> I didn't know what it was.<br> Steve was trying to tell me, it was about...<br> All about getting everything<br> and nothing out of life.<br> I didn't know what he was talking about,<br> and then I saw you.<br> Yes, sir, then I saw you.<br> Look, got a great idea.<br> Suppose you and I got married and went<br> to California together? How about it?<br> Of course, I'm rehearsing Show Girl,<br> and we open in two weeks.<br> Yeah, that's too bad.<br> If it just wasn't for that?<br> And a few other things.<br> Go ahead, tell me.<br> That's what I want to know. Like what?<br> That street down there.<br> Broadway? What a street.<br> You know something, baby?<br> It belongs to me.<br> You know something else?<br> If you want it, I'll give it to you.<br> That's the point. It's yours all right.<br> It's your whole life, too.<br> But I don't think it'll ever be mine.<br> Why, it's gonna say "Julie Benson"<br> down there in great big lights.<br> - Do you mean to say you don't want that?<br> - Yes, I want that.<br> - I'm just normal enough to want that.<br> - Sure. You're just a little scared now.<br> When you get some confidence<br> you'll begin to love it...<br> begin to feel it in your blood.<br> - That's the big difference.<br> - What's the big difference?<br> It was in your blood when you were born.<br> But I'm just a pretty good hoofer,<br> and I got a lucky break.<br> All I know is, I want a lot besides this.<br> Like what, Julie? Gotta know.<br> Well, in the first place, like a real home.<br> Sure, everybody wants a home.<br> - You won't care for the kind I'm thinking of.<br> - Why not? Why wouldn't I?<br> It would have to be far enough away.<br> Maybe way out in the country,<br> so that by the time you got there...<br> and closed the door, you'd have forgotten<br> all about show business.<br> It's funny, all of a sudden that's what<br> I've always wanted, to close a door.<br> I'll tell you something. I know the spot.<br> It's in Westchester.<br> Acres of pretty land, trees all around.<br> Go away, Steve.<br> Feeling worse all the time. Go away.<br> - Tell Ziggy I'll see Miss Benson home.<br> - It's getting pretty late, Mr. Jolson.<br> Late? But, baby, I'm going away tomorrow.<br> We're just getting places.<br> Come here, sit down.<br> Look, can you cut out that "Mr. Jolson"?<br> Why don't you just call me<br> by my southern name: Honey.<br> I know what's the trouble.<br> You don't believe me.<br> You don't believe I want anything different.<br> I'm trying to tell you, I was barging<br> through this big, beautiful world like a fool.<br> I do believe you, honey.<br> I always thought I'd like to fall in love<br> with the man I'll marry.<br> You're absolutely right,<br> and I'm not gonna rush you, baby.<br> In fact, we won't get married till I get back<br> from California. How's that?<br> Hello, darling. How are you?<br> How'd the dress rehearsal go?<br> Fine, Al. Yes, honest.<br> But opening tomorrow night<br> will be something else again.<br> I'm scared to death.<br> You got nothing to be scared about, honey.<br> You're gonna be wonderful.<br> Yeah, I'm still at the studio, working hard.<br> We shoot pretty soon.<br> It's gonna be all right, I think, when<br> I find out which end of the camera's which.<br> Get a good night's sleep and don't worry,<br> you hear? You're gonna knock them dead.<br> Yeah, I'll call you again tomorrow night.<br> Goodbye, angel.<br> - She all right?<br> - She says she's scared. She sounds it.<br> Steve, if I got a plane,<br> a special plane to fly right through...<br> I can be in New York<br> for that opening tomorrow night.<br> - What can you do in New York?<br> - I don't know.<br> I want to be there. Get on that phone.<br> Get the plane.<br> - You can't walk out on the studio.<br> - Be back soon and work twice as hard.<br> Phone Ziegfeld, tell him to hold me a seat<br> and not to tell Julie I'm coming.<br> ... is rewarded when the world<br> will become aware<br> that Liza<br> is the fairest<br> of the fair<br> Liza, Liza, skies are gray<br> But if you'll smile on me<br> all the clouds will roll away<br> Liza, Liza<br> don't delay<br> Come, keep me company<br> and the clouds will roll away<br> I just made a date with Parson Brown<br> Liza, Liza<br> name the day<br> When you belong to me<br> all the clouds will roll away<br> Liza, Liza, skies are gray<br> But if you'll smile on me<br> all the clouds will roll away<br> Liza, Liza<br> don't delay<br> Come, keep me company<br> and the clouds will roll away<br> See the honey moon a-shinin' down<br> I just made a date with Parson Brown<br> Liza, Liza, name the day<br> When you belong to me<br> all the clouds will roll away<br> - Hello, baby.<br> - Hello, honey.<br> Hello? Who?<br> Al, how are you? Tell me, how'd it go?<br> What? I can't hear you.<br> Connecticut?<br> What are you doing in Connecticut?<br> You what?<br> - Meet Mrs. Jolson.<br> - Oh, my.<br> - Asa!<br> - I'm so happy, dear.<br> Mama, please. Please, give me a chance.<br> I don't understand. Married a few hours,<br> he runs to California...<br> It'll take me a couple of months to make<br> this picture, then I'll be home.<br> And that's where he's gonna stay.<br> Asa staying home. That will be a miracle.<br> Julie, there's only one thing<br> the matter with Asa.<br> He's got to sing. It's a wonderful thing.<br> Success is beautiful.<br> But Mama and I have worried...<br> because a home with love in it<br> is even better.<br> The way you say that is a little corny, Papa,<br> but you're right. Julie agrees with you.<br> What do you think we'll do?<br> We'll build a real home and settle down...<br> out in the country where it's nice<br> and quiet, with crickets and frogs.<br> I'll teach the frogs to sing Mammy,<br> so Al won't be lonely.<br> Thank you, honey.<br> - Asa, are you serious?<br> - Sure.<br> In fact, Julie doesn't know this yet.<br> I've got an architect at work.<br> I told him, "Build a house for Julie.<br> The sky's the limit."<br> - That I approve of.<br> - So do I.<br> Here. Here have some gefilte fish<br> with the horseradish, Julie.<br> Look out for the horseradish.<br> That stuff will curl your hair.<br> I think we'll have a barn, Mama,<br> and some cows.<br> - I'm gonna milk them myself.<br> - You?<br> - You, milk cows, Asa?<br> - You have to get up at 5:00 a.m.<br> We'll keep the cows up at night<br> so they'll sleep later in the morning.<br> Julie, you got too much.<br> There's a rainbow around my shoulder<br> and a sky of blue above<br> Oh, the sun shines bright,<br> the world's all right<br> 'cause I'm in love<br> There's a rainbow around my shoulder<br> and it fits me like a glove<br> Let it blow and storm<br> I'll be warm 'cause I'm in love<br> Hallelujah, how the folks will stare<br> when they see that great big solitaire<br> Let Jolson sing it, mister.<br> He's doing all right.<br> Think so?<br> Yes, sir<br> There's a rainbow around my shoulder<br> and a sky of blue above<br> And I'm shouting so the world will know<br> that I'm in love<br> "Jazz Singer marks the end<br> of silent pictures."<br> "First talking picture sensation."<br> I have followed show business<br> for many years...<br> but I must say,<br> I have never seen a thing like this.<br> - My expert.<br> - I haven't seen anything like it either.<br> - It's almost 3:00. Where's Asa?<br> - You know what a half-hour business talk is.<br> - You go to sleep. Tom and I'll wait for them.<br> - Who can sleep on a night like this?<br> Hello, everybody.<br> We didn't realize how late it was.<br> - Did you see the papers?<br> - We saw them at Glenn's office.<br> - They're really something.<br> - "Something," he says.<br> I'm sorry, baby,<br> I wanted to celebrate tonight...<br> but we got to talking over...<br> I know, they want you to go right back<br> to the Coast to make another picture.<br> - How did you know?<br> - That was tough to figure out.<br> They said the first talking picture<br> will be a great hit.<br> - It ought to be followed with another one.<br> - You ought to go.<br> The point is I'd have to go alone. You can't<br> leave your show in the middle of a run.<br> We'll just have to wait a little while longer.<br> What happens<br> to the new Winter Garden show?<br> - That waits like Julie does.<br> - We'll talk about that later.<br> Wait a minute, Julie will be here,<br> Asa in California...<br> so where will you build your house?<br> In Kansas City?<br> Don't worry, Mama, we'll build it.<br> You're terrific to take it this way.<br> Another bad break, but it won't be for long.<br> Then you'll get everything you want, angel.<br> In fact, while I'm gone<br> you go ahead with the house.<br> Get it ready. Start building it. Start teaching<br> those frogs how to sing Mammy.<br> Yes, we're closing Saturday. It's definite.<br> I want you to fly here when you're through.<br> You were coming east when you're through.<br> A little change in plans, baby.<br> A big surprise.<br> But, Al...<br> Be on that plane no later than Sunday.<br> I'm dying to see you.<br> California, here I come.<br> Here we are, baby, home.<br> This is really something.<br> - How are you, Henry?<br> - Meet Mrs. Jolson.<br> Great to have her here, isn't it?<br> Here, baby, let me take this.<br> You want something? You want to clean up,<br> want something to eat?<br> - Henry will rustle up some grub.<br> - I don't want a thing.<br> Come on, let's go inside then.<br> Come on, fellas.<br> It's been a long time, honey.<br> Here, wait a minute, let me look at you.<br> - Never gonna let you out of my sight again.<br> - Good for you.<br> Sit down, Dick. This may take a little time.<br> - It's a little large, isn't it?<br> - It ain't exactly small.<br> You see, they used to play football here<br> before they built the Coliseum.<br> You wouldn't care for a place like this,<br> but don't let it get you down.<br> Darling, since we don't have to stay here<br> very long, I just love it.<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> Yet, on the other hand, baby, you know...<br> Come here. Sit down.<br> Got something to tell you.<br> On the other hand, what?<br> On the other hand,<br> he's talking through his hat.<br> We had a little dinner planned.<br> Forget what we arranged.<br> I can't wait, gotta tell her now.<br> What goes on here?<br> Honey, talking pictures are here for good.<br> They're getting better all the time.<br> In a few years, they'll have audiences<br> nobody ever dreamed of.<br> Studio's got terrific plans.<br> All I know is a man would have to be insane<br> to walk away from this now.<br> - AI, you went and did it.<br> - What?<br> You bought a house here. Or you're<br> building one with sunken gardens.<br> - That was the surprise you talked about.<br> - No, honest.<br> - You ain't heard nothing yet, Julie.<br> - You said it.<br> - Now, baby, now, listen...<br> - AI, are you gonna sing Mammy?<br> Quit clowning. Look,<br> you don't think I'd ask you to give up...<br> the stage and dancing and just have you<br> come out here and settle down?<br> I'd consider it.<br> I wouldn't let you do that. You're too terrific.<br> In fact, do you know what pictures need?<br> Talent, and something beautiful<br> at the same time, like you.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Listen, show business is here now, baby.<br> You belong in it, you and me both.<br> If we're together, who cares where we live?<br> The world's gotta hear about you.<br> Your name on billboards in 97 languages.<br> Greatest star pictures ever had.<br> You can't miss. The document?<br> - You didn't forget to bring it?<br> - Here.<br> Your studio's about to own<br> the biggest hunk of talent.<br> Papa's been working on this contract.<br> It's all ready to sign.<br> Wait a minute. Julie hasn't said anything.<br> - I can't think of anything.<br> - There you are.<br> Maybe she doesn't want her name<br> in more than 17 languages. Or maybe none.<br> Don't listen to him. For weeks he's<br> squawking about me rushing you into this.<br> This guy is out of his mind about pictures.<br> The latest type of Jolson rocket<br> is taking off.<br> I've been riding those dizzy things for years.<br> It's all right with me.<br> But maybe you had something<br> a little slower in mind.<br> Baby, what's he talking about?<br> Haven't the faintest idea.<br> My dear Mr. Martin, pictures need talent...<br> and what girl would take 17 languages<br> when she can have 97?<br> Shall I sign this now, Mr. Jolson?<br> Thanks, Steve, you talked her into it.<br> Here you are, baby.<br> Got a pen, Dick? We'll do this right now.<br> Call the studio. Mrs. Jolson's ready<br> for her first starring vehicle.<br> Call the studio. Mrs. Jolson's ready<br> for her first starring vehicle.<br> She's a Latin from Manhattan<br> You can tell by her manana<br> She's a Latin from Manhattan<br> And not Havana<br> Though she does the rumba for us<br> And she calls herself Dolores<br> She was in a Broadway chorus<br> known as Suzie Donahue<br> I can take a tambourine and whack it<br> But with me it's just a racket<br> She's a hoofer from Tenth Avenue<br> I'm a Latin from Manhattan<br> I'm a Forty-Second Streeter<br> She's a Latin from Manhattan<br> Senorita Donahue<br> - Here's to the real star of this family.<br> - I'll have a drink to that.<br> I thought I was pretty good.<br> - Now to Julie's next picture.<br> - Wait, let's not even think about it.<br> Not another one. Not right away.<br> I couldn't go through all that work again.<br> You can't stop now. You're up there.<br> Do another one<br> and prove the first one wasn't a fluke.<br> You won't mind the next one,<br> you're used to it.<br> And after the first dozen,<br> you won't mind anything.<br> Dozen?<br> My mother said, "Always be kind to<br> tired ladies, especially when they're pretty."<br> - Is the mob getting you down, babe?<br> - No, I like people, Steve.<br> I just wish sometimes<br> there weren't so many of them.<br> Funny how they never get tired<br> listening to him. Night after night.<br> Not so funny. He's a pretty remarkable fella.<br> That he is.<br> Soon, you and Al will wash up the pictures,<br> and you'll knock off for a long rest.<br> That'll take a miracle, Steve.<br> When I'm finished, he's in the middle of one<br> and vice versa.<br> We'll never come out together.<br> Then somebody's got to quit for once<br> and wait for the other.<br> No waits, no delays<br> in the life of the Jolsons.<br> Just a matter of<br> putting your foot down once.<br> He'll know the right time, Steve.<br> He's happy, so am I.<br> And it's not nice to put your foot down.<br> Good night, my friend.<br> Remember those plans you had<br> for that house in the East?<br> I just happened to think of that<br> the other day.<br> Find a piece of land in the country<br> around here, in the Valley, for instance...<br> and get the thing built. You'd get<br> a big kick out of that, wouldn't you?<br> I don't know, Steve.<br> That was just a romantic idea I once had.<br> What's wrong with this house?<br> It's got marble, even.<br> Good night, Steve. I'm absolutely dead.<br> I agree with you, baby. No more contracts.<br> I've told Dick how you feel.<br> But this last one, this isn't just another one.<br> This is you and me in the same picture.<br> It's one thing I've had my heart set on.<br> When we've done it, we've done everything.<br> Then we blow this town,<br> do anything you want.<br> - The script is ready.<br> - It's good.<br> - You could shoot in a month.<br> - A hard month of dance rehearsals.<br> This will be fun.<br> Why don't you go away for a year<br> and do this when you come back?<br> That's no good. Say yes, Julie.<br> - You can say no, too. You're a citizen.<br> - Shut up, Steve.<br> The stars are gonna twinkle and shine<br> This evening about a quarter to nine<br> My loving arms<br> are gonna tenderly twine, tweet, tweet, twine<br> Around you, around a quarter to nine<br> I know I won't be late<br> 'cause at half past eight<br> I'm gonna hurry there<br> I'll be waiting where the lane begins<br> Waiting for you on needles and pins<br> And then the world is gonna be mine<br> mine, all mine<br> This evening around a quarter to nine<br> Good evening.<br> - How was the picture?<br> - Wonderful.<br> - Henry, it was a mild sensation.<br> - I'm glad.<br> There's nobody here.<br> What do you know? A big Jolson preview<br> and no mob waiting at home?<br> - What do you suppose happened?<br> - It could be me.<br> - Could be you?<br> - I told Henry to tell any callers...<br> that we went straight from the theater<br> to Santa Barbara for the weekend.<br> - Suppose that did it?<br> - You're kidding.<br> Show you how it works. Listen.<br> Sorry, Mr. And Mrs. Jolson<br> left for Santa Barbara.<br> That's too bad.<br> Say we stopped by, will you?<br> - Good night, Henry.<br> - Good night.<br> - Simple.<br> - Sweetheart, that's cute.<br> Should have thought of it a long time ago.<br> - You don't really mind, do you, Al?<br> - Mind?<br> You see, tonight's a different night.<br> The last picture's finished.<br> We're free. Not a contract in the world.<br> - The governor sent the pardon.<br> - That's right.<br> I thought a quiet evening around the fire,<br> discussing plans for the future.<br> Look, sandwiches, coffee...<br> and we'll play some records<br> by a fella named Al Jolson, very talented.<br> That guy's washed up,<br> hasn't even got a picture contract.<br> - Have some coffee, Steve?<br> - Thanks, Julie, I will.<br> Honey, you sound like a gal<br> with a program all figured out.<br> First we shake this town for points east...<br> maybe farther east than that,<br> across the Atlantic, who knows?<br> Cream for you, Steve.<br> And when that's out of our system,<br> there's a little matter of building that house.<br> That I gotta see if I never see<br> another house in the world.<br> I kind of got a hankering to see it myself.<br> I'm glad to hear that,<br> because I can have it up in no time.<br> I know every room in the place.<br> I've even got it furnished.<br> Just one thing...<br> in our travels to find the right place<br> to put that house.<br> You don't mean the East, do you, baby?<br> That was the original idea. Why change it?<br> We've gotten used to this country here.<br> I like it.<br> I don't know, it feels more like home<br> than any place in the world...<br> and it doesn't matter too much to you,<br> does it, sweetheart?<br> No, not really. And if it does to you, Al.<br> Don't put it that way. There's nothing<br> special you want in the East, is there?<br> No, that's true. That settles it.<br> It's going to be here.<br> - Wonderful!<br> - And you keep quiet.<br> Only, Al, we could get out<br> in the country a little way, couldn't we?<br> - Sure, why not?<br> - Thanks.<br> That's all I wanted.<br> With no number on the house,<br> and some vicious dogs in the yard...<br> you can keep the callers<br> down to practically nothing.<br> It's Friday. What about train tickets<br> out of here, say, Sunday?<br> I can be ready tomorrow,<br> but Sunday will have to do.<br> What's the rush?<br> Let's give ourselves a little time.<br> Let's say a week or so.<br> What do we want with a week or so?<br> No kidding, a week would wrap up<br> everything fine for me.<br> - What have you got to wrap up?<br> - Not a thing.<br> He just thinks he has.<br> Nothing important at all.<br> Have a coffee, Al. It's great.<br> - Look, boys, is something cooking?<br> - No, there's nothing cooking.<br> It was just an idea, that's all.<br> A proposition about putting a company<br> together and making our own pictures...<br> Nothing definite, just talking about it.<br> Of course, in a week or so it could gel.<br> It might be a pretty exciting thing<br> to come back to. That's all it was.<br> Sorry, no gelling. First thing you know,<br> you've set a date to make a picture.<br> Then we'll have to travel with one eye<br> on the calendar or something just as bad:<br> Talking about a picture<br> all the time we're gone.<br> - Not a peep. Give you my word.<br> - Fine, darling.<br> But I know this is silly,<br> but it's gotten to be a sort of principle.<br> Once we do say<br> we're going to quit for a while...<br> - Who said we weren't?<br> - Then, whatever this proposition is...<br> it'll still be there<br> in three months or six months...<br> And just as hot, so why bother now?<br> Why don't you lay off, Al?<br> What a beating I'm taking here.<br> But look, honey, remember me?<br> This is Jolson.<br> I go with the principle every time,<br> but all I'm talking about is a couple of days.<br> When you want to spend them that way, Al,<br> that's where the principle is.<br> It isn't the days.<br> It doesn't have anything to do with time.<br> If you can't see that, Al,<br> I wouldn't know how to...<br> Holy smoke, this is a kid stunt, isn't it?<br> I'll be right back.<br> First time I ever saw Julie cry.<br> - Something wrong with me, I guess, Steve.<br> - Yeah, has been for a long time.<br> You're going to hate to stop work<br> and go away, aren't you?<br> It's going to be awfully tough, isn't it?<br> Not singing always is.<br> And here I am asking you to go away<br> without any plans...<br> without even any work to come back to.<br> Honest, it doesn't matter that much, baby.<br> You know how it is<br> when an old fire horse hears the bell.<br> I didn't say it was your fault.<br> That's not what I'm trying to say.<br> What we've got to discuss is you and me.<br> Please, Al, just listen hard for once,<br> will you?<br> You see, I'm like somebody<br> with one desperate chance left.<br> I couldn't go on this way if I wanted to.<br> That means you'd have to change.<br> You'd have to get off this merry-go-round<br> and quit for once, for a long time.<br> And I know you'd make promises<br> and try to keep them.<br> But I'd know how you felt.<br> I couldn't have any happiness<br> out of wishing the tiniest misery on you.<br> Any way you look at it,<br> there's got to be misery for both of us.<br> And the way we feel about each other, rather<br> than let that die a slow, painful death...<br> I think we ought to have the courage<br> to quit now.<br> That's the one thing that can't happen.<br> - Be honest, Al.<br> - I never understood a thing.<br> You've heard of fellas who hit the bottle<br> and wind up hopeless drunks.<br> Whatever drives me that way<br> and won't let me understand...<br> it's the same thing.<br> I've been like a fella<br> who's been drunk all his life.<br> And you know,<br> a guy like that will get so bad...<br> he'll pass up the thing he wants<br> more than anything else.<br> You don't have to tell me<br> how you feel about me. I know that.<br> No, listen, baby.<br> I do have to tell you, because listen...<br> I've been kicked around in my time.<br> I thought I could take anything,<br> but your saying you want to quit because...<br> Look, baby, if it means losing you...<br> It isn't even a contest.<br> I don't want any more contracts, or shows,<br> or any singing in the world.<br> You can't make me a gift of your whole life.<br> I just couldn't take it.<br> No, look, baby, it's giving you nothing...<br> except this show business,<br> and that's cheated me all my life.<br> It stands to cheat me right now<br> because I know what would happen.<br> I'd go on the same way,<br> working my head off...<br> living everybody's life but my own,<br> and at the same time...<br> Iose the only thing<br> I was lucky to get out of it.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> I'm kidding myself and don't know it.<br> Maybe, yes. I don't know.<br> When you've been all your life like a drunk...<br> you can't quit all of a sudden.<br> Sometimes you crave this stuff.<br> But I am sober now, baby.<br> And I want you to help me.<br> If I start yelling, hit me over the head,<br> tie me down.<br> Because when you go, baby,<br> I got nothing left.<br> So, be a pal, Julie. Do what I ask you.<br> - Hello, Henry.<br> - Sir, welcome.<br> Honey, it's a miracle.<br> Why, it fell from heaven.<br> You're over the threshold, you fool.<br> Put me down.<br> - It's a sensational job, Julie.<br> - Thank you, boys. Thank you.<br> Alice, Henry, the house looks beautiful.<br> You've done a wonderful job.<br> You've worked hard enough now.<br> Why don't you take the rest of the day off?<br> That's right. Go ahead.<br> - Don't worry about dinner. We'll get a snack.<br> - Kitchen snack. That's for me.<br> - Shall I take the bags up now?<br> - Don't worry. We'll take care of them.<br> Yeah, so long, Henry. Have a good time.<br> Checkers.<br> I used to be a champ back in Washington.<br> Come on, I'll play you a game.<br> Checkers, now? You just came in.<br> How about unpacking?<br> - We got months to unpack.<br> - Months.<br> Wood and everything. I'll light a fire.<br> We'll play right over here, nice and cozy.<br> It's not cold enough for a fire.<br> If he wants to light a fire<br> in his own home, he can.<br> That's telling him, baby.<br> Move that lamp off.<br> We'll bring the table right here.<br> Steve, get this one out of the way.<br> - What'll I do with it?<br> - Put it anyplace.<br> Get that, will you, Steve?<br> - Where?<br> - In the library.<br> Put it there. Steve, the phone.<br> Let's take that telephone out, Julie.<br> Don't be silly. We need a telephone.<br> Why? People got along without them<br> for thousands of years.<br> Anybody wants to get in touch with us,<br> let them do it by carrier pigeon.<br> We've retired, sweetheart.<br> Come on, sit down.<br> I'll play you for who's going to be boss<br> in this house.<br> - It's Dick Glenn, the studio.<br> - Not here.<br> - He wants to wish you luck in the new home.<br> - Tell him thanks.<br> If the studio has this telephone number,<br> change it.<br> Your move, baby.<br> - Big fire, isn't it?<br> - Yeah, it sure is.<br> - Want to move this way a little bit, baby?<br> - All right.<br> Cozy, Steve?<br> For a Turkish bath, it's very nice.<br> - Is it a little warm in here, baby?<br> - It is, a little.<br> There's nothing like a five-alarm fire<br> on a nice spring day.<br> You know,<br> I never wanted this table in the living room.<br> It should be in the library.<br> It's much cozier in there.<br> - You want to move in there now, honey?<br> - Yeah, let's.<br> We'll be with you in a minute, Steve.<br> Just sit down and relax.<br> It's your home, too, you know.<br> New Zealand. Go Into Your Dance<br> was playing there lately. Funny.<br> Still hearing from places like that<br> after all this time.<br> It's the fan letters from China I like to read.<br> - Where's Julie?<br> - She'll be back.<br> - For lunch?<br> - That's what she said.<br> - Where'd she go?<br> - Into town. I don't know.<br> Why didn't she tell me?<br> I could have gone along for the ride.<br> Your folks' wedding anniversary tomorrow.<br> You'll phone them?<br> - I wish we'd have gone east and celebrated.<br> - Julie wanted to go, and you said no.<br> I know. I just didn't feel like it then.<br> We should've brought the folks<br> to California for their anniversary this year.<br> We talk about doing it every year,<br> and never do. It would have been nice.<br> I wish Julie had told me<br> where she was going.<br> She'll be here in a little while. Look, Al...<br> this manuscript of Baron's new show.<br> You want to change your mind and read it,<br> or shall I send it back?<br> I don't know. Better send it back.<br> - He's wired about it twice.<br> - Why doesn't he stop wiring?<br> We've told him 50 times in this last year,<br> I'm not interested in any shows.<br> Wait a minute. Tom knows that.<br> All he wants is your opinion,<br> and any ideas you might have.<br> Tell him I'm sorry, Steve.<br> I don't want to read it. Haven't the patience.<br> - Hello, Al.<br> - There she is.<br> Surprise!<br> - Mama, Papa!<br> - Asa!<br> - What a surprise. Who thought of this?<br> - Steve.<br> - Julie.<br> - Mama.<br> No, Papa.<br> - Look, he's gonna cry.<br> - Go away.<br> A big boy like him.<br> This is the life.<br> You know, Mama,<br> if I tried, I could get used to this.<br> - You go right ahead and try, Papa.<br> - You and Mama ought to move out here.<br> Henry, will you see who that is, please?<br> We've got acres of land.<br> We'll build you a house right next door.<br> Next door?<br> How would Papa get to a synagogue<br> on the Sabbath?<br> You know, on the Sabbath, you mustn't ride.<br> It would be a long walk back to Washington,<br> especially two trips a week.<br> Mr. Baron.<br> - Hello, everybody.<br> - Tom, how wonderful to see you.<br> - Looking fine. Where'd you drop from?<br> - New York, Steve. How are you?<br> - Cantor, please sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Mrs. Yoelson.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Baron?<br> Al, you look wonderful.<br> - Hello, Tom. When did you arrive?<br> - Just flew in.<br> - Had no idea I'd find the whole family here.<br> - You lost no time finding me.<br> - That's right...<br> - You wasted a trip.<br> You can turn around and go back.<br> I'm not interested in your show.<br> Steve's told you that, hasn't he?<br> - AI, wait a second.<br> - I've quit. I've worked enough.<br> For you, too. Busting out here<br> like this'll get you nothing.<br> Al, what's the matter with you?<br> You happen to be wrong, Al.<br> To cast a Broadway show these days...<br> you have to come to Hollywood<br> to find the actors.<br> I can't imagine coming here<br> and not saying hello to you...<br> - after quite a few years together.<br> - Of course.<br> - You'll have lunch with us, won't you?<br> - Julie, I'd love to, but as a matter of fact...<br> As a matter of fact,<br> we wouldn't think of letting you go.<br> Henry, set Mr. Baron up here.<br> Move over, Steve.<br> Come here, Tom, sit down.<br> Look, pal. Look, everybody.<br> There was a crazy fella here a minute ago,<br> but I think he's gone now.<br> You can relax.<br> - How long are you staying?<br> - I'm flying back late tomorrow night.<br> Mama and Papa have the guest room.<br> There's a studio bed in the library<br> for Tom tonight. With bath.<br> - What do you say, Mr. Baron?<br> - No, I really...<br> That's settled.<br> And tomorrow night you will attend<br> the wedding anniversary dinner...<br> - of Cantor and Mrs. Yoelson.<br> - I wouldn't miss that for anything.<br> - But about tonight, I've got a hotel room.<br> - Sorry, you're staying here, my boy.<br> And look, son, I'm gonna read<br> that little show of yours tomorrow.<br> Yes, sir, I'm gonna give it Mr. Jolson's<br> personal attention and advice.<br> And tomorrow night...<br> What do you say to our<br> having the dinner party here?<br> - What do you think of that idea, Papa?<br> - This I could also get used to.<br> It's gonna be beautiful out there tonight.<br> It's about time those two<br> stopped talking in there.<br> - Luck to it, Tom.<br> - You've been a big help to me, Al.<br> I got a kick out of working on it.<br> Like old times. It happens to be good.<br> If I ever had any idea<br> of going back to the old grind...<br> it's the kind of a show I'd want.<br> Not that I have any such idea.<br> Matter of fact, I couldn't stand it.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - A show's a big job. You gotta be up to it.<br> Look at me.<br> Laying off for a long time like this.<br> Pipes not what they used to be.<br> I'll tell you something you never knew.<br> Every opening night of my life,<br> I used to have knots right in here.<br> No, that's all behind me, Tom.<br> Luck again, pal.<br> Al hasn't been as excited about anything<br> in a long time, has he, Steve?<br> I don't know.<br> - Must be a good show.<br> - Not bad.<br> He gave Tom some good ideas<br> this afternoon.<br> Julie, make him sing tonight.<br> I'm afraid we won't have any more luck<br> than we had last night.<br> He'll play records again, but that's all.<br> Well, I can understand.<br> He has sung enough.<br> - Let the records sing for a change.<br> - Nice idea, Cantor.<br> Speaking of change, Papa,<br> do you think it's been good for Al?<br> - Good? How do you mean?<br> - Does he seem happy to you?<br> Of course.<br> - Exactly like he used to be?<br> - A little more settled, maybe.<br> After all, it's time. He's no boy anymore.<br> - Dinner is ready, Mrs. Jolson.<br> - Good, I'll break this up.<br> All right, that's all, boys.<br> Join the party. Dinner's served.<br> That's that. Washes everything up.<br> From here in, Mama, we belong to you.<br> I'm hungry. Let's go.<br> My dear Cantor, if you'll give your arm<br> to the bride and lead the way.<br> The Cantor and Mrs. Yoelson<br> are the youngest couple I've ever known.<br> It doesn't matter how many years<br> they've been married.<br> All that counts is the spirit.<br> And I wish them<br> L'Chaim.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Speech, Cantor.<br> Yeah, speech, come on.<br> - No...<br> - Come on, Papa.<br> Thank you, Mr. Martin.<br> That was very beautiful.<br> In fact...<br> That wine was very good, Mama.<br> I mean, what you said before<br> about the spirit, Mr. Martin.<br> By a strange coincidence...<br> we actually said something just like that...<br> the night of our wedding,<br> while Mama and I were dancing.<br> I said, "Let's always dance."<br> And how we danced that wedding night.<br> Asa, you should have seen us.<br> I remember, you couldn't be there.<br> Anyhow, I thank you all.<br> That was very good, Papa.<br> Remember that, Asa?<br> I've heard you sing it<br> a thousand times, Papa.<br> That was the waltz at our wedding.<br> Come on, Asa, sing with me.<br> No, you go ahead, Papa.<br> Listen to this.<br> As a little boy, he used to sing<br> with me at the synagogue.<br> What's the matter? Too big a man now?<br> Mama, tell the truth.<br> Who was always a better singer, me or Asa?<br> You, of course, Papa.<br> Do you hear that? Come on.<br> Please?<br> How we danced<br> on the night we were wed<br> We vowed our true love<br> though a word wasn't said<br> The world was in bloom<br> there were stars in the skies<br> Except for the few<br> that were there in your eyes<br> Dear, as I held you close in my arms<br> Angels were singing a hymn to your charms<br> Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low<br> "Darling, I love you so!"<br> The night seemed to fade<br> into blossoming dawn<br> The sun shone anew<br> but the dance lingered on<br> Could we but recall<br> that sweet moment sublime<br> We'd find that our love<br> is unaltered<br> by time<br> - That's that.<br> - Thank you, Asa. That was very nice.<br> Cantor, you two<br> have a fine dancing act there.<br> Do you think we could pick up a little time?<br> I can book you solid for the season.<br> It was a beautiful party, Julie.<br> I'd like to take over from here on.<br> Suppose we drive into town<br> and you all be my guests at a nightclub.<br> - What do you say?<br> - Nightclub now?<br> Yes. We could see an early floor show,<br> and I can catch my plane.<br> - No, let's not.<br> - Why?<br> Well, I haven't been<br> in one of those spots in years.<br> We're just country folks, Tom.<br> We don't go for that fast life.<br> Anyway, Mama and Papa<br> wouldn't be interested in a nightclub.<br> Yes, we would.<br> There you are.<br> And it's not your anniversary, son,<br> it's theirs. Come on, let's go.<br> In all your years in show business, Papa,<br> you didn't see anything like this yet.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm interrupting<br> the show to make an announcement.<br> We have a celebrity with us...<br> a man you've enjoyed and admired<br> for many years.<br> He's been away for a long time,<br> and we've missed him a lot.<br> But he still is the greatest entertainer<br> of them all.<br> Wonder who he means?<br> It's an honor to introduce...<br> That's right, it's Mammy<br> and the man who made it famous...<br> the one and only Al Jolson!<br> The idiot.<br> There's a slight chance,<br> if we ask him hard enough...<br> just for old times' sake,<br> Mr. Jolson might give us a song.<br> - This guy's crazy.<br> - Come on, Al!<br> Sorry, no.<br> They're not going to stop.<br> Better do it and get it over with.<br> Baby, it looks like<br> I'm not going to get out of this. I'm sorry.<br> Thanks, Eddie. Thank you, boys.<br> That was a big introduction.<br> Just talk into this?<br> Thank you, folks.<br> It's nice to be remembered.<br> I can't tell you how nice.<br> But about singing for you,<br> you see, I'm a little rusty...<br> but you asked for it,<br> so we'll just make it a quick one.<br> - What do the boys handle that I can sing?<br> - Anything.<br> Robert E. Lee.<br> I don't think I'll need this.<br> Watch them shuffling along<br> See them shuffling along<br> Go take your best gal, your real pal<br> Go down to the levee, I said the levee<br> join that shuffling throng<br> Hear that music and song!<br> It's simply great, mate, waiting on the levee<br> Waiting for the Robert E. Lee<br> Watch them shuffling along<br> See them shuffling along<br> Go take your best gal, your real pal<br> Go down to the levee, I said the levee<br> Join that shuffling throng<br> Hear that music and song<br> It's simply great, mate, waiting on the levee<br> Waiting for the Robert E. Lee<br> Great.<br> More!<br> They'll mob him.<br> All right.<br> Come on out, gang. Everybody.<br> Everybody in the show,<br> come out and sit down.<br> You work hard every night<br> and must be tired of doing this show.<br> Just sit down,<br> and I'll take over for you tonight.<br> Haven't worked in a long time.<br> Gather around,<br> make yourselves comfortable.<br> You ain't heard nothing yet.<br> You pick it, Professor. What'll it be?<br> Rock-a-bye!<br> Yes, sir. I think I remember that one.<br> Rock-a-bye your baby<br> with a Dixie melody<br> When you croon, croon a tune<br> from the heart of Dixie<br> Hang that cradle, Mammy mine<br> Right on that Mason-Dixon line<br> And swing it from Virginia<br> To Tennessee with all the soul that's in you<br> Weep No More, My Lady<br> You see, what he didn't have at home,<br> Mama, was an audience.<br> Live faces. Isn't that it, Steve?<br> And Old Black Joe, just as though<br> you had me on your knee<br> A million baby kisses I'll deliver<br> if you will only sing The Swanee River<br> Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby<br> with a Dixie melody<br> Rock-a-bye hush-a-bye<br> to a Dixie melody<br> When you croon, croon a tune<br> from the heart of<br> You see, Papa,<br> Al was sure he didn't want to sing anymore.<br> He wanted to be with me.<br> - I think I let him make the wrong decision.<br> - I don't get this, Julie.<br> I think Papa does.<br> To Tennessee with all the soul<br> that's in you, Mammy!<br> Mammy, listen what they're playing<br> They're playing Weep No More, My Lady<br> Sing it for me and Old Black Joe<br> just as though you had me on your knee!<br> A million baby kisses I'll deliver<br> if you will only sing The Swanee River<br> Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby<br> with a Dixie melody<br> April Showers!<br> You heard them, Professor.<br> Though April showers may come your way<br> Though April showers may come your way<br> They bring the flowers<br> that bloom in May<br> So if it's raining<br> have no regrets<br> because it isn't raining rain, you know<br> it's raining violets<br> And where you see clouds<br> Excuse me.<br> You soon will see crowds<br> of daffodils<br> So keep on looking for a bluebird<br> - Where do you think you're going?<br> - Home.<br> Throw some things in the car.<br> - I'll be gone by the time he gets back.<br> - Don't do that, Julie.<br> He tried awfully hard, Steve...<br> - but you and I know he's got to do that.<br> - Now, wait...<br> See that he's on that plane<br> with Tom tonight. They'll do a great show.<br> - This is going to kill him, Julie.<br> - It isn't going to be so good for me, either.<br> But, look, when did you last see him<br> as happy as that?<br> Have no regrets<br> Because it isn't raining rain<br> you know, it's raining violets<br> Steve, when he gets home nights<br> after the show...<br> don't let him sing too long.<br> You soon will see crowds<br> of daffodils<br> So keep on looking for a bluebird<br> And listening for its song<br> Whenever April showers<br> come along<br>
