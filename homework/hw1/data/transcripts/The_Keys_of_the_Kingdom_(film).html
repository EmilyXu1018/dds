                        [Bell Tolling]<br> - Good afternoon, Monsignor.<br> - Good afternoon, Father.<br> How long have you been here<br> in Tweedside, Father Chisholm?<br> - Twelve months.<br> - Ah, yes, I remember now.<br> It was your particular wish<br> to return to your native parish.<br> This is also the native parish<br> of His Grace, the bishop.<br> I'm aware that Bishop Mealey<br> shares with you...<br> the... distinction<br> of having been born here.<br> What age are you now, Father?<br> Now, no older than Angus Mealey.<br> No doubt, but life has treated you<br> somewhat differently.<br> To be brief...<br> the bishop and I both<br> have the feeling that your...<br> long and faithful years<br> should now be recompensed...<br> that you should, uh, retire.<br> But I have no wish to retire.<br> I'm sure you will understand that this has<br> been a somewhat painful experience for me-<br> this week of investigation.<br> I find that I must<br> point out to His Grace...<br> certain, uh...<br> peculiarities in the administration<br> of your parish...<br> which he can scarcely overlook.<br> - Peculiarities?<br> - Some of your sermons, the advice you give...<br> your approach to...<br> certain points of doctrine.<br> Still peculiar after so many years.<br> Here is a remark that you made<br> in Holy Week.<br> "All atheists are not godless men.<br> I knew one who I hope<br> may now be in heaven."<br> But he was a peculiar atheist.<br> And then,<br> "The good Christian is a good man...<br> but I found that the Confucianist<br> usually has a better sense of humor."<br> When Mrs. Glendenning,<br> one of your best parishioners...<br> whom naturally cannot help<br> her extreme stoutness...<br> came to you for spiritual guidance,<br> you looked at her and said...<br> "Eat less. The gates<br> of paradise are narrow."<br> I'm afraid that you have<br> lost your command of souls, Father.<br> I have no wish<br> to command anyone's soul.<br> Naturally, I don't presume<br> to be your judge.<br> I can only submit my findings<br> to His Grace...<br> for his consideration<br> in reaching a final decision.<br> Now, if you don't mind,<br> Father, I will go to my room.<br> I shall be leaving<br> the first thing in the morning...<br> and I have work still to do.<br> Uh, would you-would you<br> be good enough to remind Angus-<br> His Grace, I mean-<br> that we were boys together?<br> The bishop has not forgotten.<br> He spoke about it only last week.<br> - Well, mention it to him again, will you?<br> - Of course.<br> L- I shouldn't like to leave here,<br> if it could be helped.<br> Naturally. Good night.<br> This is my native parish,<br> you know.<br> Good night, Father.<br> "Francis Chisholm- his journal.<br> "1878.<br> "Nothing could have been<br> more remote from the life I have lived...<br> "than the beginning of it.<br> "My father was a master fisherman<br> in the little village ofTweedside...<br> "the finest, the most honorable man<br> I have ever known.<br> "He was a Catholic, as I was.<br> "My mother was a Protestant.<br> "The words, as I write them,<br> seem divided...<br> "but never were three souls<br> more nearly one...<br> "never were three hearts<br> as happy and as filled with love...<br> as ours for each other. "<br> We're having company<br> for supper tonight, remember.<br> Polly's coming up from Tynecastle,<br> and she's bringing Nora.<br> - Nora?<br> - What's wrong with Nora, lad?<br> She's a girl.<br> A very proper objection, but<br> you'll have to learn tolerance, laddie.<br> Women can't help it<br> that they're not men.<br> Alex, I wish you'd let one of the other men<br> take the accounts to town.<br> There'll be trouble again.<br> Last week I knocked<br> their heads together...<br> and this week I'll do the same<br> if they cross me.<br> To please me, Alex.<br> Like as not, they'll not say a word,<br> one way or the other.<br> I'll be back for supper.<br> - Good-bye, son.<br> - Good-bye, sir.<br> What is there to fear<br> in the town, Mother?<br> I'm sorry, Francie.<br> What did you say?<br> I said, what is there<br> to fear in the town?<br> You and your father<br> are Catholics, son.<br> Some people fear Catholics.<br> Some people hate them.<br> [Thunderclap]<br> - It's coming down.<br> - Aye, it is.<br> - Well, good night, Mac.<br> - Good night, and mind what I tell you, me lad.<br> - Be careful.<br> - I'll be all right. Don't you worry.<br> There goes that dirty papist!<br> We told you Roman scum<br> to stay away from this town!<br> [Thunder Rumbling]<br> It's the storm that's keeping him.<br> [Loud Thunderclap]<br> I can't stand it any longer, Polly.<br> - I'm going with you.<br> - No, Francie.<br> You stay here.<br> Go with her, son.<br> She may need you.<br> Thank you, Nora.<br> Francie. Francie!<br> I don't want anything<br> to happen to him.<br> Hold on to me, Alex.<br> We'll make it home.<br> Carefully.<br> Careful!<br> The water!<br> It's filled my boot!<br> Alex!<br> - Help yourself. Go away.<br> - No!<br> - No! No!<br> - Let go! Let go!<br> No! No!<br> Mother! Father!<br> Go into the house, Nora.<br> I don't want to go in just yet.<br> Let me stay with you.<br> No, please, Nora.<br> [Sobbing]<br> [Stifled Crying]<br> [Sobbing]<br> [Monsignor Reading]<br> "Although I was not related by blood...<br> "to either Polly,<br> her brother Ned or Nora-<br> "they were distant cousins<br> of my father-<br> "they took me to live with them<br> in Tynecastle.<br> "Their kindness and affection<br> once more filled me with happiness...<br> "and, as the years went by,<br> I became increasingly satisfied...<br> "with the fact that Nora was a girl.<br> "My return to college<br> after each vacation...<br> became an increasingly difficult<br> parting for both of us. "<br> Well, Francis,<br> I'm glad you finally arrived.<br> People were beginning to think<br> Willie was here to see me off.<br> I am, in a way.<br> I want to be sure you go.<br> Francis, are you sure you have the tickets?<br> Hello, Willie. Hello, Angus.<br> You and Francis better get aboard.<br> First thing you know, we'll be standing<br> here talking, and you'll miss the train.<br> And so it's good-bye again.<br> But it'll be Christmas<br> before we know it, and I'll be here.<br> - And go away again.<br> - For the last time ever.<br> I'll be graduated in June.<br> Angus is going on from Holywell<br> to the seminary.<br> I'll wish him the best of luck<br> and come home to you.<br> - And then-<br> - And then?<br> - What is it?<br> - Nothing.<br> Tell me.<br> - You won't come home to me.<br> - Nora!<br> If you do, you'll go away again<br> to the seminary with Angus.<br> - Please.<br> - You're going to become a priest, Francis.<br> Why won't you get that<br> out of your mind?<br> - I can't, any more than you can.<br> - I love you.<br> - And you love Polly too.<br> - Of course I do, but-<br> She just lives for the day<br> you become a priest.<br> It's all she talks about<br> and dreams about and prays for.<br> It's the reason you went to school<br> with Angus instead of Willie...<br> because Holywell<br> is a Catholic college.<br> I'm sure Aunt Polly would be very happy<br> if I were to become a priest.<br> In fact, I know she would.<br> But there isn't a chance of it.<br> How could there be when I feel<br> about you the way I do?<br> How strong will your feelings be when they come<br> up against what Polly wants more than anything?<br> She's had her way with you. She's wrapped<br> you around her finger since I can remember.<br> You're not being<br> very fair to her, are you?<br> No, I suppose not.<br> Well, why don't you<br> just wait and see?<br> I'll try.<br> But sometimes I get so afraid...<br> and so lonely.<br> - [Train Whistle Blows]<br> - [Polly] Francis!<br> Francie.<br> Francis, how could you wait until<br> the last second to say good-bye to me...<br> when there's so much<br> I had to say to you?<br> I'm sorry, Aunt Polly, but there<br> was a lot I had to say to Nora too.<br> - It's been wonderful to be home.<br> - Take care of yourself.<br> - Write to me often and study hard.<br> - Of course I will.<br> - Francis! You've got the tickets. Come on.<br> - Be right with you, Angus.<br> Good-bye, Ned. Thanks for everything.<br> Take good care of Aunt Polly.<br> - I'll do that.<br> - Good-bye, Willie.<br> Good luck on your med studies,<br> and write to me.<br> Francie, you'll get the next heart<br> I dissect as a valentine.<br> - [Whistle Blows]<br> - Good-bye, dear.<br> Well, now, I'm not going off<br> to the salt mines in Siberia.<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> - Good-bye, Nora.<br> - Good-bye, Francis.<br> - Come on. The train will be<br> starting in just a minute.<br> - You'll miss the train.<br> - Is everything there, Angus?<br> - Yes.<br> Let me know if you want<br> anything, Francis! Good-bye!<br> Bye, Nora. Bye, Aunt Polly.<br> Bye, Ned.<br> Bye. Have a nice trip.<br> - Bye!<br> - Wait a minute. I forgot my present for Angus.<br> Something for those cold nights<br> at Holywell.<br> Are you sure<br> you can part with it?<br> I wouldn't want to deprive you<br> of your only comfort.<br> Well, I never thought I'd live to see a Scotsman<br> throw a bottle of whiskey out a window.<br> And another one to stand there<br> and let him do it.<br> But there was a third Scotsman<br> there to catch it!<br> Well, this is a sort of<br> an empty moment, isn't it?<br> I don't think I'll ever get used to<br> not having Francie around.<br> It'll be a good thing that next year<br> he's home to stay.<br> I wouldn't be so sure of that.<br> Francis may decide to go on<br> to the seminary after all.<br> And why not?<br> He's a fine boy.<br> It's a fine church.<br> [Monsignor Reading] "My studies prevented<br> me from returning home for Christmas...<br> "as I had planned.<br> "As always, it was necessary for me<br> to work twice as hard as the next man...<br> "to accomplish as much.<br> And so, another summer had come. "<br> - [Knocking]<br> - Come in.<br> Chisholm, what explanation<br> have you to offer for your conduct?<br> - Have I done something wrong, Father?<br> - Something unforgivable.<br> You- I've forgotten what, exactly.<br> Merely an additional example of what seems<br> to be a general mental disobedience in you.<br> Just what was it specifically, Father?<br> During my instruction, I referred<br> to the one true and epistolic religion.<br> - He saw fit to question this description.<br> - Well?<br> My question was meant<br> as a question, Father.<br> I asked whether God set<br> an exclusive value on creed...<br> since it was such<br> an accident of birth.<br> The answer<br> to your question is "yes."<br> Have you done any fishing lately?<br> I've been thinking<br> I might try the Glebe Pool, sir.<br> - There's a big one there.<br> - There's nothing in the Glebe Pool.<br> - There's a big one there now, sir.<br> - Oh! Imaginary.<br> - If you've no further need of me, Father-<br> - Thank you, Father.<br> Sit down, Francis.<br> Sit down.<br> You'll be out of here<br> in another term.<br> Isn't it about time you made up<br> your mind about the future?<br> Yes, I've tried to, sir.<br> I think of it all the time.<br> I've been appointed a rector of our San Juan<br> seminary in Spain beginning next year.<br> - You'll be leaving Holywell?<br> - Yes.<br> I'd hoped that we might<br> meet at San Juan next fall.<br> - I think you'd make a good priest.<br> - Thank you, Father. L-<br> You seem confused, lad.<br> You've got worries eating at you.<br> - Would it help to talk them out?<br> - Oh, it's just that l-<br> Well, I know there's<br> a vocation for me, Father...<br> but I don't know where to find it.<br> I can't go on letting Polly and Ned<br> support me.<br> How can I ever repay them<br> for what they've done already?<br> I'd be no help about the tavern.<br> Besides, it's almost a year since I've<br> been home, since last summer's vacation.<br> In all that time,<br> so little word from any of them.<br> And now a letter from Polly...<br> asking me not to come home this year.<br> She doesn't say why. Just that it's best,<br> and she begs me not to come.<br> I feel there's something wrong,<br> that I ought to help.<br> I'm sure that if help is needed<br> and you can help...<br> there's none they'd rather<br> ask for than yours.<br> How can I be expected<br> to stay away without a reason?<br> You cannot say that<br> there is not a reason.<br> I had my heart set<br> on never leaving Holywell.<br> You had yours set on going home.<br> What do you say?<br> Shall we both agree<br> to let Almighty God have his way?<br> Hmm?<br> [Chuckles]<br> You're in love with Nora,<br> aren't you, Francis?<br> - You say you actually saw that fish?<br> - Oh, yes, Father, I did.<br> Well, then why aren't we after him?<br> Eh? Before he's gone.<br> - Here. Here's a rod.<br> - Yes, Father.<br> There.<br> Well, what are we waiting for?<br> Thank you.<br> Keep its head up, MacNabb.<br> Up. Up!<br> Ah, careful! Careful now.<br> Ooh! Watch him, lad.<br> Watch him.<br> - Watch him! Oh. Oh, MacNabb.<br> - You got him, Father.<br> MacNabb, what a bonny,<br> bonny fisher you are!<br> - Oh! Get your net, boy. Get your net.<br> - Don't worry, Father.<br> Here he comes, lad.<br> Get him before he's lost!<br> [Chuckles] You know, I wouldn't object<br> to your eating so little...<br> if it didn't emphasize<br> the fact that I ate so much.<br> [Train Whistle Blows]<br> It was fine of the Lord, I think,<br> to put all the little fishies in the brooks...<br> and to send me here to catch them.<br> [Whistle Continues]<br> It's a lonely sound, that.<br> When I was a homesick lad<br> and heard it in the night...<br> I'd imagine it was the cry of a lost soul<br> speeding through eternity.<br> My imaginings<br> are less spiritual, Father.<br> To me it's the Southern Express,<br> the only thing I have of home.<br> It whistles for me, and tomorrow night<br> it will whistle for them.<br> - Please understand, Father. I've got to go home.<br> - I do understand, Francis.<br> If only Nora would write,<br> if only she-<br> You know, she objected bitterly<br> to my coming back to Holywell.<br> - She thinks that l-<br> - Yes, yes, I know.<br> Sit down a moment, Francis.<br> I've got something to tell you.<br> - You've got bad news. Is it about Nora?<br> - Aye.<br> - Why wasn't I told?<br> - Because it wasn't easy to tell.<br> Sit down, lad.<br> How long is it<br> since you've seen Nora?<br> It's been over a year now.<br> I've told you.<br> You told me she<br> quarreled with you then...<br> because she thought you were<br> being made a priest here despite yourself.<br> She knew in her heart<br> that that wasn't so.<br> I have no way of knowing what<br> was in Nora's heart, but it seems that...<br> after you left, she-<br> Have any of your friends<br> written to you about her?<br> I have only one friend, Willie Tulloch.<br> He's been away at medical school.<br> - Yes, he's at home now.<br> - At home?<br> - Aye, looking after her.<br> - But-<br> Nora changed a great deal, Francis,<br> and all to the bad, I'm afraid.<br> She became increasingly bitter...<br> even with those who loved her most.<br> There seemed little she cared about-<br> her own character least of all.<br> - Until finally-<br> - Father.<br> What is it you're trying to say?<br> What's happened?<br> A baby was born to her<br> some six weeks ago. A little girl.<br> She alone knows who the father is.<br> She will not say.<br> She's desperately ill.<br> But it was her express wish<br> that you were not to be sent for.<br> I've often wished that<br> I were a wiser man than I am...<br> but never so much as now.<br> I cannot tell you to do anything...<br> except what is<br> in your own heart to do.<br> You can still<br> catch that train, Francis.<br> Good-bye, Father.<br> God bless you, lad.<br> [Whistle Blows]<br> Willie.<br> - How is she?<br> - Francie, Nora is dead.<br> It would be easier<br> if you didn't go up now.<br> Come on.<br> Let's walk a bit, huh?<br> [Bell Tolling]<br> [Choir Singing, Indistinct]<br> - Willie.<br> - Yes, Francie?<br> - [Tolling Continues]<br> - [Choir Vocalizing]<br> Amen<br> [Monsignor Reading]<br> "It would be pleasurable to record...<br> "that I became an immediate<br> success as a priest.<br> "Alas, the facts were quite otherwise.<br> "I failed dismally<br> in my first two curacies.<br> "There seemed to be little promise of success<br> in my next- or ever, for that matter.<br> "When one day there came<br> a summons from the new bishop-<br> the new bishop and my guardian angel<br> of old, Hamish MacNabb. "<br> [Chuckling]<br> Francis, it does my old eyes good...<br> to see a priest so manifestly<br> unprosperous as you.<br> I walked most of the way in the rain.<br> I'm afraid I got a little wet.<br> Too rebellious even to use<br> an umbrella, eh? [Chuckling]<br> Go over to the fire.<br> I'll get you something warm.<br> I'm not yet properly accustomed<br> to my new dignity.<br> I ought to ring and command<br> some of the fine vintages...<br> used by all the bishops<br> one reads about.<br> This is only whiskey.<br> But then we're only Scotsmen, huh?<br> But don't look so scared.<br> Sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Sit down.<br> Under these bishop's robes<br> there still beats the heart of MacNabb...<br> the master fisherman.<br> Remember?<br> [Chuckling]<br> Well, here- here's to us.<br> You've had a pretty thin time of it,<br> haven't you, Francis?<br> "Thin's" the kindest possible<br> word for it, Your Lordship.<br> Failure might be closer<br> to the facts.<br> Hmm. Well, now, let's see.<br> You've had<br> two curacies since Holywell.<br> At the first, Shalesley, you insisted<br> upon establishing a dance hall.<br> It was a recreation center, Your Lordship.<br> There was a desperate need of it.<br> If you could have seen the poverty<br> and destitution of those people.<br> At any rate, there was a rather<br> serious disagreement...<br> between you and your superior.<br> You were then transferred<br> to Tynecastle, to your home.<br> There, your closest personal<br> association was with an atheist.<br> Willie Tulloch. He's a doctor now,<br> as his father was when he saved my life.<br> Willie's my oldest and dearest friend and<br> one of the kindest men I've ever known.<br> Atheists have reason to be kind.<br> Then Father Fitzgerald.<br> He found you argumentative and<br> frequently guilty of unorthodox doctrine.<br> - Nothing I did seemed pleasing to him.<br> - Just to Almighty God, eh?<br> Certainly, he cannot be<br> too pleased with me.<br> In our Father's house,<br> there's so many mansions.<br> Surely there's room for me.<br> I've tried so hard, believe me...<br> and failed so miserably.<br> Am I so ill-equipped to give<br> what's in my heart to give?<br> It's strange.<br> When I was a little boy, I imagined it was<br> not in the least difficult to be a priest...<br> that they were all infallibly perfect.<br> And now you've discovered<br> how frighteningly human we are. Hmm?<br> [Chuckles]<br> To me you have never been a failure...<br> and I think you never will be.<br> Well, thank you, Your Lordship.<br> But don't ask me why.<br> I'm sure I couldn't say.<br> Perhaps because I've always<br> been partial to the stray cat...<br> who comes stalking<br> down the aisle...<br> when everyone is yawning<br> their heads off at a dull sermon.<br> You're like that cat, in a way.<br> I haven't been able<br> to take me eyes off you.<br> And I can't help thinking<br> you're in the church, not by chance...<br> but for a reason.<br> You can do with some cheering up,<br> so I'll risk giving you a swelled head.<br> You've got inquisitiveness<br> and tenderness.<br> You're sensible of the difference<br> between thinking and doubting.<br> You feel an excitement<br> about your work...<br> that'll keep it<br> from ever becoming routine.<br> You'll never become what I call<br> "an ecclesiastic mechanic."<br> No. I don't want ye ever to change.<br> You understand, of course.<br> I say these nice things to you...<br> because I want you<br> to do something for me.<br> You've made it impossible for me<br> to say anything but "yes," Your Lordship.<br> That's why I've been made a bishop.<br> Now, this will call<br> for great personal sacrifice.<br> It will mean<br> a long period of training...<br> in language, customs, procedure.<br> It'll not be an easy life.<br> No, nor a safe one.<br> But I believe sincerely<br> it is the life for you.<br> The Society for the Propagation<br> of the Faith...<br> has asked me to supply<br> a volunteer missionary...<br> for China.<br> - Will you go?<br> - China?<br> It'll mean leaving far behind you<br> everything that is near to you now-<br> your home, your friends,<br> Aunt Polly-<br> - Judy.<br> - Judy?<br> Yes. Nora's little girl.<br> - She means a great deal to me.<br> - Of course.<br> - I'll be happy to go, Your Lordship.<br> - I knew you would.<br> And you'll be a credit<br> to both of us.<br> Come to see me again before you leave.<br> We'll pray for ye.<br> Thank you, Your Lordship.<br> Oh, Francis?<br> Take this with you.<br> It's a good thing to have.<br> You never know when<br> it's going to rain.<br> [Sniffling]<br> [Monsignor Reading]<br> "How different from the China of today...<br> "was the country to which<br> I came so many years ago.<br> "Exploited and abandoned<br> by the world around her...<br> "starving and struggling to realize<br> what was then just a hope, a dream-<br> "unity and dignity<br> and a place in the sun.<br> "And so I came to China,<br> to the province of Chekhow...<br> "a thousand miles from the sea...<br> to my mission in the city of Pai Tan.

I'd rather walk.<br> - [Speaking Chinese]<br> - Oh, thank you. Thank you.<br> - My-My trunk is on board.<br> - [Chinese]<br> Shall we go?<br> Well, why are we stopping here?<br> - Surely the mission cannot be far now.<br> - Here, Father, is the mission.<br> Why has this taken place?<br> The work of the devil, Father.<br> It was a beautiful mission<br> and cost much...<br> but the good father who is gone<br> place it too near the river...<br> and the devil sent much wicked rain.<br> Where are the people of the congregation?<br> Why have they done nothing to rebuild?<br> Father must realize that for almost<br> one year now, we get no cash.<br> Cash?<br> You mean, you were<br> given money? Why?<br> To buy rice, Father. How else<br> could we bring new members?<br> But among the 400 communicants<br> listed on the books...<br> surely there must have been<br> many true Christians.<br> If you mean those who believe<br> without rice, yes, there were many.<br> But as we told you, Father, they went far<br> into the hills to the Christian village.<br> - And those who have remained?<br> - Their faith left them when the rice gave out.<br> And... you?<br> As soon as Father restores our lawful<br> stipend of 15 taels per month...<br> he will find us as useful as ever.<br> And for that, we include<br> the serving of Mass.<br> Then I think you should know<br> that I cannot pay you any money.<br> [Chinese]<br> I should warn you that I understand<br> almost everything you say.<br> Also, I know what rice-Christians are.<br> I have no interest in them whatever.<br> Perhaps Father needs to understand<br> more than the language of Pai Tan.<br> There is much animosity lately<br> against the foreigners...<br> particularly if they are without money.<br> It would be wise for Father<br> to have two friends of influence.<br> Without them it might be<br> that harm could come to him.<br> [Monsignor Reading] "While the ruined stable<br> was suitable for my living quarters...<br> "it was not likely<br> to attract many converts.<br> "Accordingly, I used part<br> of my meager funds...<br> to rent a small room in the city.

L-<br> Good-bye, Mr. Pao.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Pao.<br> - Good morning.<br> - How's the boy?<br> - Shen-fu will know that better than I.<br> Well.<br> You look just fine, Chia Yu.<br> [Chinese]<br> Oh, I'll want the basin<br> and some hot water, please.<br> We can't be certain of anything, of course,<br> but there seems to be little to worry about now.<br> - I'll stop in again this evening.<br> - I have been instructed...<br> to thank you and to say it will not be<br> necessary for you to trouble yourself again.<br> Oh, it's no trouble at all, just<br> a simple matter of changing a dressing.<br> Even that will no longer<br> be required, thank you.<br> My cousin Mr. Chia regrets<br> having been incapable...<br> of expressing<br> his gratitude in person.<br> His grief has been such<br> that he has chosen not to show it openly.<br> And now that his son<br> will soon be well...<br> it is probable Mr. Chia will soon<br> present himself once more in public.<br> Good day.<br> Good day, Mr. Pao.<br> Dear Lord, let me have patience<br> and forbearance where now I have anger.<br> Give me humility, Lord. After all,<br> it was only thy merciful goodness...<br> and thy divine providence<br> that saved the boy.<br> But they are ungrateful,<br> and you know it!<br> It will seem strange<br> to the doll at first...<br> to have one leg almost as big<br> as she is altogether.<br> But like all women, she will soon be convinced<br> that she would not have it otherwise.<br> - Have you given her a name?<br> - Anna.<br> "Anna" is your name, because you came<br> to us on the feast day of St. Anna.<br> But what will you call your doll?<br> - Anna.<br> - You're becoming a very obstinate little girl.<br> And besides, you eat too much.<br> We will call your doll "Victoria."<br> - Doll Anna!<br> - [Chuckles]<br> Joseph, you haven't<br> won an argument yet.<br> This little female is a victim<br> of overeating, Father.<br> Well, is it possible we have<br> a Sunday afternoon visitor?<br> Oh, uh, come in, please.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Eh, will you sit down?<br> May I take the liberty<br> of telling you who I am?<br> I know who you are, Mr. Chia.<br> - Now, may I sit down?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> To speak of first things first,<br> my only son whose life you saved is well.<br> Last week he walked<br> with me in the garden.<br> - This week he is able to run<br> with his friends and play.<br> - I'm very happy to hear that.<br> For myself, there have been many matters<br> to attend, much business to settle.<br> But now- now I am here.<br> Uh, why are you here, Mr. Chia?<br> Naturally, to become a Christian.<br> You mea- Have you come<br> to believe in Christianity?<br> In time, I will no doubt<br> accustom myself to it.<br> Christianity is not a habit, Mr. Chia.<br> Do you want to become a Christian?<br> I am here. Is it not therefore apparent<br> that such is my wish?<br> Not at all.<br> Why are you doing this?<br> You have done<br> the greatest good for me.<br> I must now do the greatest good<br> I can for you.<br> If I as a Mandarin accepted<br> your Christian belief...<br> all of Pai Tan would follow...<br> - as inevitably as the day follows the sun.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I'm sure that you mean well, Mr. Chia,<br> but you would not be doing good for me.<br> You do not believe,<br> nor do you desire to believe.<br> My acceptance of you<br> would be a forgery for God.<br> Do you mean, you reject me?<br> Yes, I mean precisely that.<br> And please, do not feel that I wish ever<br> to make any demands upon your gratitude.<br> You owe me nothing.<br> I regret that I am not acceptable.<br> I understand that this is so<br> because I am unworthy.<br> Nevertheless, perhaps there<br> will be some way in which l-<br> - [Door Closes]<br> - Go.<br> Father realized that<br> he has turned down a Mandarin.<br> Well, I see no difference<br> between buying a man's soul and...<br> taking it in exchange<br> for services rendered.<br> It has occurred to me to ask: Has Shen-fu<br> ever looked or walked upon yonder hill?<br> Why, yes, often. It's the most beautiful<br> part of the countryside.<br> The property is large and extent-<br> more than 60 mous.<br> It is called "the hill of<br> the brilliant green jade."<br> - It is mine.<br> - Yes, I gathered as much.<br> I, uh, could not help but notice that the<br> grounds and buildings of your mission...<br> - are in a disastrous condition.<br> - We'll manage with God's help.<br> I would like to help,<br> too, in my humble way.<br> I beg you to honor me by accepting<br> as the property of your church...<br> - the hill of the brilliant green jade.<br> - Mr. Chia!<br> With all land and water rights, and the rights<br> to the clay pit, without restraint, forever.<br> I beg further that you accept<br> the use of 20 of my workmen...<br> and the materials to accomplish fully<br> any building you may wish to carry out.<br> Are you serious?<br> If I were not, I would be unworthy<br> to look upon my son as his father.<br> The deeds and legal papers<br> will be delivered to you tomorrow.<br> Joseph!

Well, I'll take it<br> in to her myself.<br> Joseph, will the pheasants<br> keep until tomorrow night?<br> They are in no condition<br> to run away, Father.<br> Good evening:Reverend Mother.<br> Good evening:Father.<br> - Oh, please, sit down, sit down.<br> - My supply of ink was gone.<br> I imagined I would find some here.<br> - Oh, does our little schoolroom please you?<br> - It seems excellent<br> There'll be 20 children<br> here tomorrow morning.<br> - I'm looking forward to meeting them.<br> - We have a fine dispensary.<br> I've been hoping that you'll find time<br> to assist me with it.<br> If you will let me know<br> the dispensary hours, I shall be there.<br> I haven't much medical knowledge...<br> but we've achieved<br> the most amazing results with simple-<br> - What a beautiful photograph.<br> Did you take this yourself?<br> - No.<br> - But you've been there?<br> - Yes. It is Schloss Anheim in Austria.<br> Schloss Anheim. Oh, I'm sure I've heard that<br> name. It sounds historic. Is it near your home?<br> - Yes. Quite near.<br> - Hmm.<br> How different it must be<br> from my own home- uh, from Tynecastle.<br> Oh, I don't mean just geographically,<br> but living in all its aspects.<br> For instance,<br> the idea of a ruling class-<br> of a rigid discrimination<br> between an aristocracy-<br> Father Chisholm, I'm sure<br> you understand how earnestly...<br> Sisters Clothilde, Martha and I desire<br> to work for the success of this mission..<br> You only have to mention your wishes,<br> and we shall do all we can.<br> At the same time-At the same time, I trust<br> you will afford us a certain freedom of action..<br> Oh, what do you mean?<br> As you know, our order<br> is partly contemplative.<br> We should like to enjoy<br> as much privacy as possible-<br> Uh, take our meals alone,<br> maintain a separate establishment.<br> Nothing else was ever intended. Naturally,<br> your little house will be your convent.<br> Then you will permit me<br> to manage all of our convent affairs.<br> Oh, by all means. Only, uh, be careful about money.<br> We are very poor.<br> Our order has made itself<br> responsible for our support.<br> We shall not require<br> financial assistance.<br> No? Doesn't your order<br> enforce holy poverty?<br> Holy poverty, Father Chisholm,<br> does not require me to beg.<br> I'll send you a note of the dispensary<br> hours and of the church services.<br> Good evening, Reverend Mother.<br> He has just been here...<br> to see me, our peasant priest...<br> dripping with good fellowship<br> and very careful of his manner.<br> His boots, however,<br> were not much cleaner...<br> than they were this morning.<br> Of course, Mother, you will know...<br> that every word I write<br> is a sin against God...<br> but I cannot help myself.<br> I dread the future...<br> shut up in this isolated spot...<br> dedicated to serve certainly<br> the lowliest subjects of God's kingdom...<br> and dedicated to a belief<br> in their equality with me before God.<br> I wanted it so.<br> I have it so.<br> [Monsignor Reading]<br> "As the weeks passed...<br> "my disappointment at being unable to win<br> the friendship of our Reverend Mother...<br> "was lost in my growing<br> admiration for her efficiency...<br> "and the manner in which the mission<br> prospered through her efforts...<br> and those of her associates. "<br> - Good morning, Ah.<br> - Good morning.<br> [All]<br> "Our Father, who art in heaven...<br> "hallowed be thy name.<br> "Thy kingdom come,<br> thy will be done...<br> "on earth as it is in heaven.<br> "Give us this day our daily bread...<br> and forgive us our trespasses"-<br> All right, Mei-fei.<br> That's all for today.<br> Come back tomorrow, hmm?<br> - Thank you, Father.<br> - There.<br> - [Rapping]<br> - Yes, come in.<br> We are here, Mumu.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Uh, have you brought your things?<br> Yes.<br> Our few humble possessions..<br> Then go to the small house.<br> Sister Martha will show you your quarters.<br> Thank you, Mumu.<br> - Is that the couple you hired?<br> - Yes.<br> I've had dealings with them.<br> I know them well, to my misfortune.<br> And theirs, too, apparently.<br> They've described the incident to me.<br> I'd hardly call it an incident.<br> To put it charitably,<br> they're far from reliable characters.<br> I find very little charity in the way you put it,<br> and even less of Christian forgiveness.<br> I would fail in my responsibility<br> toward the mission and you if-<br> You have no responsibility<br> toward me.<br> If I did not warn you that they're a bad lot<br> and advise you to get rid of them at once.<br> I will not get rid of them!<br> May I remind you of your promise that I am to<br> be responsible for the management of my house?<br> Father. Father.<br> - There is a man at the gates<br> who desires to see you.<br> - Who is he?<br> A most peculiar man.<br> He speaks the same tongue as Father..<br> - and insists that he will see no one else.<br> - Didn't he give you his name?<br> Yes, Father. He said to tell you that<br> he was the devil's number one boy.<br> - What?<br> - Joseph! You've been drinking.<br> There's only one man in the world-<br> But that's impossible!<br> It couldn't be!<br> Willie Tulloch !<br> Up pops the devil!<br> Willie !<br> [Chuckles]<br> - [Gasps] Francie, my boy!<br> - What brings you here?<br> - What a wonderful surprise.<br> - Oh, it shouldn't be so surprising.<br> After all, in almost 40 years, a man gets to know<br> as much about Tynecastle as he'll ever know.<br> So one day, I set to wondering<br> whether there was a hill...<br> behind the hill I could see<br> from me office window.<br> I went to look, and by George,<br> there was another hill behind that one.<br> Well, with one hill after another, here<br> I am in China and your sacred presence.<br> Have you forgot your etiquette, man?<br> Do the honors.<br> Forgive me. Reverend Mother,<br> this is Dr. William Tulloch.<br> Dr. Tulloch's my oldest friend.<br> I think it's only fair to tell you,<br> Francie is not to be blamed for me.<br> And I, for my part, have long ago<br> disclaimed any responsibility for him.<br> I see no reason why<br> you should want to, Doctor.<br> I hope you enjoy your visit with us.<br> - I'm sure that Father Chisholm<br> will make you most welcome.<br> - I'm sure.<br> - And this is Joseph.<br> - I am most honored, sir.<br> Hello, Joe.<br> Let's empty your luggage later.<br> Let's all go in and have some tea.<br> If you'll excuse me, I have some work<br> to do. It was a pleasure, Doctor<br> The pleasure was mine, Mother.<br> Quite a woman.<br> - Sure you won't have a drop?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Aye, Judy's a strange lass-<br> moody and perverse and unpredictable.<br> A little like her mother, perhaps.<br> Well, she'll marry one day,<br> I imagine, when she sees fit...<br> and maybe she'll find<br> happiness in life.<br> Happiness in life.<br> It depends on what you do,<br> what you give, what you get.<br> I've given the world<br> thousands of aspirin tablets...<br> and I've acquired a taste<br> for Irish whiskey.<br> And I'll thank you<br> not to use my maudlin self-pity...<br> as an argument to prove<br> the existence of the soul..<br> Why should I try to argue you<br> into something you already believe?<br> Now, look, Francie.<br> In the three days since I've been here-<br> Eh, Joseph?<br> Now, where on earth<br> did you get that?<br> Forgive me, Father. This evening I found it<br> necessary to give Hosannah Wong a beating.<br> - Mm-hmm. So?<br> - His wife hit me with a broom handle.<br> - I gave her a beating too.<br> - Equal rights for women. I agree.<br> Despite my warnings, they continue to say<br> many unkind words about you.<br> For instance, that<br> Mother Maria-Veronica is a great lady...<br> while you are simply dust.<br> Well, we're all dust, Joseph. Surely<br> we can put up with a few unkind words.<br> Perhaps you, Father, who are<br> blessed with tolerance and charity.<br> - But not I.<br> - Uh, I'm very displeased with you, Joseph.<br> a holiday tomorrow<br> and that new robe you've been wanting..<br> The new robe?<br> Shall I beat him again, Father?<br> [Chisholm Chuckles]<br> No, no!<br> Willie, will you excuse me, please?<br> - I've been asked to come<br> to the sisters' house at once.<br> - Of course.<br> - Could I be of any help?<br> - Oh, thank you, no. It'll be all right.<br> Father Chisholm, thank God you're here.<br> Those hypocrites!<br> - Those low-lying fiends!<br> - Where are Hosanna and Philomena?<br> Gone with our money and our silver<br> and Sister Martha's ivory crucifix.<br> - They could have murdered us!<br> - But they didn't, Sister Clothilde.<br> - Where's Reverend Mother? Has she been told?<br> - At once, of course, Father.<br> She had nothing to say.<br> She went straight to her room.<br> They should be punished, those miserable<br> people who steal from the church.<br> It was my fault that<br> your crucifix was stolen.<br> I know how dear it was to you.<br> Please accept this<br> in its place if you can.<br> It is not ivory, but is<br> over a thousand years old...<br> and has always been one of the most precious<br> possessions of my family and of myself.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Father.<br> - Good night, Father.<br> Good night.<br> - [Chia] Good evening, Shen-fu.<br> - Mr. Chia! Well, this is indeed a pleasure.<br> It is good to see you again. May I offer you<br> my hand in the fashion of the English?<br> - May I offer you a cup of tea<br> in the fashion of the Chinese?<br> - Thank you, but I must decline.<br> My little son waits in my chair.<br> I have come hurriedly to pay my respects<br> and to say farewell for a while.<br> We are even now on the way<br> to my summer home in the mountains.<br> Summer home? But you've just come back<br> from there. Autumn's practically upon us.<br> It would afford me great happiness<br> if you and the ladies who assist you...<br> would lower yourselves<br> to be my guests.<br> Your offers are very kind<br> and generous, Mr. Chia.<br> But you would not leave Pai Tan and take<br> your son to the safety of your summer home...<br> without an important reason.<br> - What is it?<br> - You wish me to- How is it said?<br> Come to the point.<br> - Exactly.<br> - Very well.<br> As you know, the revolutionary troops,<br> the soldiers of the new Chinese Republic...<br> - have been in Pai Tan for some weeks.<br> - Yes, I know that.<br> What you do not know is that some<br> Imperial troops under General Wai...<br> have moved into the hills today.<br> He has already issued an ultimatum<br> of surrender to the Republican troops...<br> - and the ultimatum has been<br> contemptuously disregarded.<br> - I see. What will happen now?<br> General Wai threatened<br> an immediate bombardment of the city.<br> I cannot understand why<br> it has not already begun.<br> It strikes me, Shen-fu, that<br> with the Imperial troops in the hills...<br> and with the Republican troops in the city,<br> your mission is inconveniently in the middle.<br> I'm sure that our neutrality<br> will be respected.<br> It is a pleasant assumption.<br> But in any case, would it not be wise...<br> to remove yourself and your female<br> associates at once to safety?<br> Thank you, Mr. Chia, but I'm sure<br> that none of us would consider...<br> leaving the mission at such a time.<br> If you should change your mind-<br> But then, you have a mind<br> that is uniquely unchangeable.<br> Again, in the fashion of the English,<br> good night, my friend.<br> I appreciate your coming, Mr. Chia.<br> We're indebted to you once again. Good night.<br> [Explosions]<br> In the name of heaven,<br> what was that?<br> Shooting-<br> Someone's shooting at us!<br> Oh, now, Sister Clothilde,<br> it's nothing of the kind.<br> Imperial troops on the hill<br> have opened fire on the city.<br> - I'm afraid it's the beginning of a battle.<br> - [Explosion]<br> - Oh!<br> - Sister Clothilde!!<br> I'm sure you realize that<br> our conduct at this time...<br> will serve as an example<br> for the Christian women.<br> I'm going to the children.<br> They'll be frightened.<br> As soon as you quiet them, leave one<br> of the Chinese women in charge.<br> - Then come to the schoolroom.<br> - As you say.<br> Sister Martha, bring any servants<br> you think can be of help.<br> Yes.<br> Joseph, I want you to take one<br> of the men and go into the city tonight.<br> See that as many members of the congregation<br> as possible come to the mission at once.<br> They're to bring with them their bedding<br> and whatever food they may have.<br> Mei-li, you and the women will draw up<br> a list of all the provisions in our stockroom.<br> We'll need it in the event<br> it becomes necessary to ration food.<br> Also the medicines.<br> Sister Martha will supervise.<br> Sister Clothilde, you will see to it that<br> no change is made in the children's routine.<br> Above all, nothing must be done to alarm them<br> or make them feel in any way insecure.<br> Any questionable decisions will be left<br> either to the Reverend Mother or to me.<br> Now, I think you'd all<br> better get started<br> God has set a great<br> responsibility upon us.<br> We must all work hard together.<br> - It'll be necessary to forget<br> any personal differences.<br> - Of course.<br> Father, some of the shells have landed<br> in the city. There are many fires.<br> The Imperial general has picked a strange<br> way of winning the love of the people-<br> - blowing them to bits?<br> - We better see how bad it is, Willie.<br> [Explosion]<br> - I should be down there, Willie.<br> - Why?<br> - Why? Because I'm a priest.<br> - But most of your congregation<br> will soon be up here and safe.<br> Forgive me, but what makes you think you're<br> wanted down there at a time like this?<br> I don't pretend that I'm wanted anywhere-<br> but God's mercy is, everywhere.<br> I've got no right to quarantine it<br> behind these mission walls.<br> Major, the town is full<br> of wounded and dying.<br> There's a great danger of pestilence.<br> Why is nothing being done?<br> - What would Shen-fu suggest?<br> - There's a British doctor<br> who's doing everything he can.<br> But we must have some of your men to help,<br> and we must have a house to use as a hospital.<br> [Laughs] I'm childish enough to contemplate<br> helping my civilian brothers...<br> even without reward,<br> but I cannot spare any of my soldiers.<br> Man, you're fighting to<br> liberate the Chinese people.<br> These are Chinese who need you<br> tonight to save their lives.<br> Huh! I cannot see the sense<br> of bringing dying people back to life...<br> so that General Wai can again<br> kill them with his cannon.<br> - Is the situation that hopeless?<br> - We have no artillery at all.<br> By the time my promised<br> reinforcements arrive...<br> we will have been<br> inevitably massacred.<br> [Gunfire, Explosions]<br> Oh, Shen-fu.<br> When you arrive at your mission,<br> you might say a prayer for us.<br> I'm not going back to the mission.<br> I'm going to the Street of the Basket Makers.i.<br> What can you and your doctor<br> do by yourselves?<br> - Whatever good we can as long as we can.<br> - Wait.<br> You will have your hospital, Shen-fu.<br> The Imperial judge<br> is a coward and thief.<br> We will commandeer his home, and<br> I will personally kick down his front door.<br> [Explosion]<br> Major.<br> - Tell them to bring in the next one.<br> And remember, one squad is to be detailed<br> to the sole duty of scrubbing this floor...<br> continuously and with disinfectant.<br> It is comforting to know<br> that when we are hit...<br> we will be the most<br> antiseptic cadavers in Pai Tan.<br> But remember how close<br> to godliness cleanliness is.<br> Maybe so, but I've never seen<br> godliness kill bugs.<br> Don't be shocked.<br> It's a matter of religion.<br> He believes in God, you probably count on<br> Confucius, and I put my trust in prophylaxis.<br> Meantime,<br> here's a patient for both of us.<br> Better clear out this entire section.<br> As you say, Doctor.<br> It's not a pretty idea, Francie, but it's vitally<br> necessary we dispose of those who've died.<br> Under the circumstances<br> this is the only proper method.<br> Under no circumstances can burning<br> be called a proper method, Willie.<br> Depends on the point of view.<br> From where I stand, I see this village...<br> left without fresh water<br> and proper sanitation.<br> I see pestilence waiting to move<br> right in to these miserable hovels...<br> filled with unburied dead.<br> We have a responsibility<br> to the living too, Francie.<br> Yes, we have.<br> Well, it seems<br> there's no alternative.<br> - You're sure that all<br> the wounded have been removed?<br> - Yes, but it was not easy.<br> They did not want to leave the dead. Will you join<br> me, Shen-fu, in touching off our holocaust?<br> - You, Doctor.<br> - No, thanks.<br> Tell me- Can hell<br> be any worse than this?<br> The sun is on its way up,<br> and that blasted gun has gone to bed.<br> Another dawn is here,<br> and another night is gone.<br> I'm gonna write a book:<br> Six Days and Nights<br> in a Chinese Abdomen.<br> I must be daft.<br> I'm talking to myself.<br> Hmm?<br> Oh! Silly.<br> I must've dozed off.<br> I don't know why it's silly, seeing<br> you've had no sleep in almost a week.<br> Why don't you leave today's<br> collection to the army and me?<br> Go up on the hill and get yourself<br> a bath and 400 winks.<br> Now, that'd be a pretty sight: A man<br> of God taking his ease safe from harm.<br> This is no time<br> to think of appearances.<br> Besides, who's to see you here<br> in this abandoned outpost of humanity?<br> We're not unseen anywhere, Willie.<br> Kill yourself if you've a mind to,<br> but keep your motives to yourself...<br> - because they just make me mad!<br> - [Joseph] Are you in there, Shen-fu?<br> - Father Chisholm!<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Last night they fired on the mission.<br> - What? Was anybody hurt?<br> - How are the children?<br> - The children are all right,<br> but our beautiful church-<br> It was destroyed by fire. Some of the men were<br> injured when we tried to save the altar pieces.<br> Uh, tell the major I'll be back.<br> Oh, Father, this way.<br> And keep your head down.<br> [Gunfire]<br> Willie!<br> Willie.<br> [Mouthing Words]<br> Francie?<br> If you're praying for yourself,<br> go right ahead.<br> If it's for me,<br> you're wasting your time-<br> aye, and the Almighty's too.<br> Now, let him be<br> the judge of that, Willie.<br> My respiration is down...<br> my fever's up...<br> and I am deep in<br> the Valley of Shadow.<br> And, Francie,<br> I still can't believe in God.<br> - Are you mad at me?<br> - Of course not.<br> Are you disappointed that<br> I won't let you save me?<br> Your salvation will<br> be your doing, Willie-<br> - And mine.<br> Say, when you...get to your kingdom...<br> don't look for my name on the register.<br> It would be fun<br> just to meet by chance.<br> Francie...<br> I never loved you<br> as much as I do now...<br> because you haven't tried<br> to bully me into heaven.<br> You see...<br> I have such an awful headache.<br> Give me your hand.<br> Out of the depths I have<br> cried unto thee, O Lord.<br> Lord, hear my voice.<br> Let thine ears be attentive<br> to the voice of my supplication...<br> because with the Lord<br> there is mercy.<br> With him there is<br> plentiful redemption.<br> Glory be to the Father, to the Son...<br> and to the Holy Ghost.<br> In a way, uh, my actions<br> may have been responsible...<br> for the shelling of the church.<br> Late yesterday afternoon, several wounded<br> soldiers made their way to our dispensary.<br> I took it upon myself to admit them.<br> There's nothing else to do.<br> I would've done the same.<br> Must be a great blow to you...<br> to see your beautiful church<br> so wantonly destroyed.<br> No one can destroy my church.<br> I shall build it again.<br> As long as I live,<br> I shall build my church.<br> [Joseph]<br> Father. Father.<br> Father, the Imperial captain, the one<br> who commands the gun, is here.<br> He demands that you talk to him.<br> All right.<br> - You want to see me?<br> - Yes. General Wai has decided<br> to favor you with several requests.<br> First: You will stop sheltering<br> the enemy wounded.<br> The wounded are beyond fighting.<br> They can do nobody any harm.<br> Second: General Wai confers upon you<br> the honor of contributing to his supply.<br> Your first contribution<br> will be 800 pounds of rice...<br> and all the American<br> canned goods in your possession.<br> - We're already short of food,<br> and I have no intention-<br> - Third: It is essential that all Chinese men...<br> be released immediately from your protection<br> to enlist in the army of General Wai.<br> And what will happen if I decline<br> the honor of complying with these requests?<br> You already have a slight indication.<br> In less than half an hour I will be able to<br> reduce your mission and everyone in it to dust.<br> [Conversing In Chinese]<br> You must realize that it'll take me<br> a while to comply with all your demands.<br> - How much time will General Wai permit me?<br> - Possibly until tomorrow...<br> provided that you deliver to me<br> by midnight tonight at my gun position...<br> a personal offering consisting<br> of tinned goods and sufficient valuables...<br> to comprise a suitable offering.<br> Well, it seems I have no alternative.<br> I'll be at your gun position tonight.<br> Good. I shall expect you.<br> I warn you not to fail.<br> - Joseph.<br> - Yes, Father?<br> Tell the reverend mother<br> I've gone to the city.<br> Major Shon, suppose- suppose it were<br> possible to capture General Wai's gun?<br> About 20 of my men are now explaining<br> to their ancestors why it is not possible.<br> - I know.<br> - I understand several are being<br> ministered to at your mission...<br> for which I thank you.<br> If I could get near that dishonorable<br> weapon, I would demolish it, but I cannot.<br> - There's a way to get near to it.<br> - I do not doubt your goodness.<br> But permit me to question your<br> ability to perform miracles.<br> I've been ordered<br> to bring food and money...<br> to the captain in command<br> of the gun tonight before midnight.<br> My friend, you are<br> an undeserved gift from heaven.<br> I'm afraid I've forgotten<br> about heaven tonight.<br> Then concentrate closely<br> on what I am about to propose.<br> [Whispers]<br> Shen-fu! It must be nearly time.<br> - Just 11:30.<br> - You understand exactly what is going to occur?<br> - Yes. We've been over it a dozen times.<br> - For the 13th then.<br> In this sack is cordite<br> and one can of gasoline.<br> When I fire into the gasoline, it will<br> ignite instantly and explode the cordite.<br> But before that, even before I raise my revolver,<br> you must begin to move away from the gun.<br> - I understand.<br> - You must be well away,<br> for the concussion will be extreme.<br> Captain! After Shen-fu and I have left,<br> you will count to 250 slowly.<br> Then you and your men<br> will follow us carefully.<br> When the explosion occurs,<br> you will attack successfully. That is all.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Light the torch now, if you will.<br> [Chinese]<br> And for the love of your Lord in heaven<br> and my perishable body...<br> keep it away from this sack.<br> [Shouting In Chinese]<br> I'm Father Chisholm.<br> I was instructed to come by your captain.<br> You brought what<br> was demanded of you?<br> I brought you a load of tinned goods,<br> which I hope will impress you.<br> And I brought you some money too.<br> - Give it to me.<br> - All right.<br> Would you hold this?<br> I want some assurance that<br> the mission won't be molested.<br> Not only will the mission<br> not be molested...<br> but tomorrow we shall occupy it<br> and place it under our protection.<br> - [Men Laughing]<br> - [Chisholm] You gave me your word.<br> [Captain]<br> Stop chattering and give me the money!<br> [Gunfire Continues]<br> - [Shouts In Chinese]<br> - [Gunshot]<br> Shen-fu, run! Save yourself!<br> - Am I at the mission?<br> - Yes, Father.<br> We are all well and safe.<br> And the gun- Is it finished?<br> It is finished...<br> and 32 of the enemy<br> blown into little pieces.<br> Never in my life<br> have I seen such a lovely killing.<br> One more like that,<br> and you will force me...<br> to endure Christianity.<br> The question is...<br> how long will Christianity<br> be forced to endure killings like that?<br> [Monsignor Reading]<br> "My shattered leg had barely mended...<br> "when word reached us that Angus Mealey-<br> Monsignor Angus Mealey by now-<br> "was to visit us on a tour of inspection...<br> on behalf of the International Society<br> for the Propagation of the Faith. "<br> - Francis !<br> - Angus !<br> Francis, my dear fellow.<br> It's wonderful to see you again!<br> Oh, it's a great pleasure<br> to welcome you, Angus.<br> - What a wonderful day. What a healthy climate.<br> - Come in. Come in.<br> I see you've hurt your foot, old boy.<br> Nothing serious, I hope.<br> Well, children. Thank you.<br> Thank you. Sister.<br> - Oh, Mother Maria-Veronica.<br> - Reverend Mother, how do you do?<br> How do you do, Monsignor?<br> - Sister Clothilde.<br> - Sister Clothilde.<br> - Sora Martha.<br> - Sora Martha.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Well, this is a splendid establishment.<br> Splendid. Yes, splendid.<br> Now I regret I can't stay longer<br> than today and tonight...<br> but you know I must be<br> on my way again tomorrow.<br> In the meantime, let me<br> fill every minute with memories...<br> of our beautiful mission.<br> Angus, there's something<br> I want to tell you.<br> Later, my dear fellow. Later.<br> Let us steal these first moments to enjoy<br> the happiness of reunion and companionship.<br> Then, after a hot bath<br> and a change,<br> Why, Francis, l-<br> Wh-What has happened<br> to your church?<br> Well, we've had a few<br> reverses, Angus.<br> I'm not going to try and hide<br> my disappointment from you, Francis.<br> Frankly, I had my heart set on celebrating<br> High Mass in your church.<br> Your disappointment<br> is no greater than ours, Angus.<br> I'd even promised a lecture<br> at our London headquarters:<br> "St. Andrew's Mission,<br> or God in Darkest China."<br> It places me- It places all of us<br> in a most awkward position.<br> - I'm truly sorry. I've tried to explain-<br> - I'm not reproaching you.<br> It wasn't your fault, I know.<br> Still, if only Reverend Mother<br> hadn't antagonized that wretched general-<br> She did exactly as I would have done.<br> Would you have acted otherwise?<br> No, no, no.<br> Of course not.<br> But there are many ways<br> of overcoming difficulties, Francis...<br> and some are more satisfactory<br> than others.<br> We've had our own difficulties<br> at home, too...<br> with the reorganization necessary<br> after Bishop MacNabb's death.<br> Oh, no.<br> Oh, weren't you told?<br> Oh, I am sorry.<br> Yes, he- he died in March<br> of pneumonia.<br> He was a very old man,<br> of course...<br> and muddled and past his best.<br> He was succeeded by Bishop Tarrant,<br> a most worthy choice.<br> Well, we must take things<br> as they are and face them.<br> Now that I'm here, I'll do my best<br> to get things straightened out.<br> I've had quite some experience<br> in such matters.<br> It might interest you<br> to hear one day how l-<br> [MacNabb's Voice] I think you'd make<br> a good priest, Francis.<br> And now you've discovered<br> how frighteningly human we are.<br> I can't help thinking<br> you're in the church, not by chance...<br> but for a reason.<br> Shall we both agree to let<br> Almighty God have his way? Eh?<br> I seem to be depressing you<br> pretty thoroughly.<br> What do you say<br> to a nice, brisk walk?<br> Then this evening, after dinner,<br> we can entertain the reverend mother...<br> and have a real round-table<br> parochial conference.<br> I'm afraid you're in for another<br> disappointment there, Angus.<br> Reverend Mother never leaves<br> the sisters' house after the dinner hour.<br> Nonsense! You just haven't<br> asked her properly, I'm sure.<br> I took the liberty<br> of sending her an invitation..<br> She'll come, all right.<br> Come on, Francis.<br> It isn't important, of course,<br> but it's been pointed out...<br> that I am the youngest monsignor<br> in the northern diocese.<br> I've even been accused of having<br> an overactive thyroid gland.<br> - A glass of wine, Reverend Mother?<br> - No, thank you.<br> But it's first-rate, I assure you.<br> Pale Amontillado. No?<br> - Francis?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> It's a little traveled, perhaps,<br> since it came with me from home.<br> You know, I must admit<br> China fascinates me.<br> I disagree violently<br> with those of our world...<br> who still regard the Chinese<br> as an inferior race.<br> Truly there are no limits<br> to the benefits of a belief in God...<br> and-[Chuckling]<br> Plenty of soap and water.<br> Uh, your record's been<br> truly remarkable, Angus.<br> I understand you founded<br> two new missions in Japan...<br> and a native seminary in Nantou.<br> Yes, and I'm happy to say<br> that all three are flourishing.<br> Unfortunately for you,<br> however, Francis...<br> they've put quite a strain<br> on our financial reserves.<br> I can't see how you're going<br> to rebuild your church.<br> I'm afraid the Society<br> cannot let you have the money.<br> - I haven't asked for it.<br> If only you had been<br> more successful...<br> with some of the better-class Chinese-<br> the rich merchants.<br> If only your friend Mr. Chia<br> had seen the light.<br> He hasn't, and he's given most generously.<br> I'm not going to ask him for another penny.<br> Well, that's your own affair.<br> But I must tell you frankly, Francis...<br> that on our charts at headquarters...<br> I'm sorry to say that<br> your convert rate is the lowest.<br> I suppose missionaries differ<br> in their individual capabilities.<br> Oh, surely no one doubts<br> your capabilities, Francis.<br> It's just in the way you do things.<br> Living personally in such poor style...<br> eating in the kitchen and all that.<br> Well, you ought to impress the natives,<br> make more of a show.<br> But the Chinese hate<br> that kind of ostentation...<br> and priests who practice it<br> are regarded as dishonorable.<br> You refer to their own<br> low heathen priests, I presume.<br> Heathens are not always low,<br> just as Christians are not always high.<br> Many of their priests<br> are good and noble men.<br> Well, have it your own way.<br> It's just struck me.<br> I can still give<br> that lecture in London.<br> I shall make my subject the dangers<br> and difficulties of the missionary field.<br> "God Chastiseth His Own."<br> Does that idea appeal to you,<br> Reverend Mother?<br> I am sure that my judgment<br> must mean very little...<br> beside your vast experience<br> in such matters.<br> And now it is time for me to go.<br> May I escort you to your house,<br> Reverend Mother?<br> Mei-li and I can manage very nicely.<br> You needn't trouble, Monsignor.<br> Oh, no trouble at all,<br> I assure you.<br> And besides, you may have some<br> problems more easily discussed...<br> away from<br> Father Chisholm's presence.<br> Father Chisholm is aware<br> of all my problems.<br> Well, in that case, we shall discuss<br> the baroness, your distinguished mother...<br> whom I had the pleasure<br> of meeting in Vienna last year.<br> No, thank you.<br> - Good night, Father Chisholm.<br> - Good night, Reverend Mother.<br> - Good night, Joseph.<br> - Good night, Reverend Mother.<br> Be right back, Francis.<br> - Father, may I say something sinful?<br> - Of course not.<br> You will hear it in confession anyway,<br> because I'm thinking it.<br> - Joseph.<br> - Yes, Father.<br> The benefit of too much<br> soap and water...<br> made the sherry bottle<br> fall and break.<br> Reverend Mother, good-bye.<br> Sister Martha,<br> Sister Clothilde, good-bye.<br> It was really most generous of your friend,<br> Mr. Chia, to let me borrow his chair.<br> Be sure and thank him<br> for me, won't you?<br> He doesn't want to be thanked.<br> He regards it as an honor.<br> Yes, I suppose he does.<br> Still, he finds it impossible to-<br> Well, I shall never be able<br> to fathom the Oriental mind.<br> It's inscrutable,<br> positively inscrutable.<br> Francis, my boy, good luck<br> and God bless you.<br> Thank you, Angus.<br> Come back again.<br> I promise you a church in which<br> you'll be proud to celebrate High Mass.<br> You're practically an Oriental yourself,<br> as far as understanding you is concerned.<br> I'm gonna give up trying.<br> You'll build your church.<br> I can think of no way<br> in which it will be possible.<br> That's why I know you'll do it.<br> Good-bye, Francis.<br> Good-bye, Angus.<br> - All right.<br> - [Rapping]<br> - Good-bye!<br> - [All] Bye!<br> Good-bye.<br> May I speak with you?<br> Oh, please excuse me.<br> I didn't notice.<br> - I don't want to disturb you.<br> - Not at all.<br> As you can see,<br> nothing for me to do.<br> I've come to tell you<br> something...<br> and it- it isn't easy for me.<br> Please sit down.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> From our first meeting...<br> I have behaved shamefully<br> and sinfully toward you.<br> I want you to know that<br> I am most bitterly sorry for my conduct.<br> Believe me, no apology<br> was ever more abject than mine...<br> nor has anyone ever been<br> less worthy of forgiveness.<br> - You needn't-<br> - Please.<br> It's easier for me to speak now.<br> It becomes easier with every word.<br> How strange that the moment of my<br> greatest humiliation should bring with it...<br> the only peace I've ever truly known.<br> I was born into arrogance, Father, and<br> taught contempt for those who were not.<br> How could I hope to live<br> by the word of God...<br> which is the same for all men?<br> From the beginning...your presence tortured me.<br> I knew that yours was a true humility...<br> and that mine was a duty.<br> I resented your deep<br> and honest compassion...<br> because mine was difficult...<br> and filled with doubt and pain.<br> Last night I intended to ask<br> Father Mealey to send me away.<br> But as I sat in your kitchen, as I...<br> heard him humiliate you<br> and slight you...<br> as I felt the magnificence of your faith<br> and the courage in your heart...<br> as I saw you reject<br> the worldliness of this priest...<br> who is unfit to untie your shoes-<br> [Sobbing]<br> Oh, forgive me, Father.<br> Forgive me. Pity me.<br> There-There's nothing<br> for which I have to forgive you.<br> I'm so glad you<br> no longer dislike me.<br> You know...<br> we're all children to God...<br> and with his help,<br> we'll work and mature.<br> [Monsignor Reading] "The 10 years that<br> passed were fruitful, peaceful...<br> "and unnoticed in their going...<br> "as passing years should go.<br> "I would like to note,<br> of no possible interest to anyone...<br> "that they treated me personally<br> with exceeding kindness...<br> "except, that is, for increasing<br> difficulties with my injured leg...<br> "and the diminishing ability to see much<br> further than the tip of my nose.<br> "But my personal joy was a workshop...<br> "outfitted for everything<br> from mending school benches...<br> "to separating beeswax from honey.<br> "The beeswax would become<br> candles for my church...<br> "and the honey would go<br> to my children...<br> to my children's children.<br> "Two hundred faithful souls<br> were in my congregation...<br> "and not a grain of rice<br> in any of their prayer books.<br> "Our new church was but one<br> of the many debts we owed...<br> "to the thoughtfulness<br> of Mother Maria-Veronica...<br> "and the generosity of her family.<br> "Some of the older girls<br> were already novices...<br> "and others were ready<br> to go into the world-<br> "this world that,<br> I will always maintain...<br> is closer to heaven than we think. "<br> Fresh honey today, my friends.<br> Fresh honey.<br> Ah, it's a pity<br> that none of you like it.<br> Joshua, tell me,<br> which would you rather do-<br> learn your catechism<br> or eat honey?<br> - Eat honey.<br> Eat honey?<br> Well, God loves you, Joshua,<br> for telling the truth..<br> - For that you shall have a double portion.<br> How can we restore discipline?<br> - They'll all be jealous ofJoshua.<br> - That's very simple.<br> Give them each a double portion<br> with Joshua's compliments.<br> - Has Joseph brought you the news?<br> - That he intends to marry?<br> Oh, he's the last to know. That girl's<br> had him helpless for over a year.<br> I was referring to something less joyous.<br> - Another mission has been opened in Pai Tan.<br> - Oh?<br> They've rented a fine house<br> and have a great deal of money.<br> Well. American, of course.<br> Yes.<br> It is their intention to build<br> an enormous establishment...<br> with schools for both<br> girls and boys, playgrounds...<br> and a hospital<br> with resident doctor.<br> Sounds extremely beneficial.<br> - What denomination is it?<br> - It's, uh, Protestant.<br> - The American Methodists.<br> - Hmm.<br> You know, I remember when I was<br> a little boy and used to go berry-picking.<br> I always resented the other little boys<br> who found the same bushes that I did...<br> and insisted on picking the berries.<br> I knew that they had just as much right<br> to them as I did. And yet-<br> And, uh, what are you going to do<br> about these little boys?<br> Do?<br> I shall put on my good suit,<br> take my umbrella and call upon them.<br> Good afternoon.<br> I'm Father Chisholm.<br> I took the liberty of calling<br> to welcome you to Pai Tan.<br> - Oh, won't you come in?<br> - Thank you.<br> You'll have to forgive the way things look.<br> We're not even unpacked yet.<br> - Dr. Fiske-That's my husband-<br> - [Man] Who is it, Agnes?<br> - He's in there. It's a caller, Wilbur.<br> - Well, have him or her come in.<br> - If you don't mind.<br> - It would be my pleasure.<br> - Well, how do you do?<br> - I'm Father Chisholm. Welcome to Pai Tan.<br> Thank you. I've heard a<br> good deal about you, Father.<br> I don't know whether I should return<br> your thanks for that or not.<br> Oh, you should. You can be well proud<br> of your reputation.<br> Frankly, I'm surprised<br> that I have any at all.<br> News travels<br> amazingly fast in China...<br> and reputations are made<br> and unmade just as quickly.<br> - Won't you sit down, Father?<br> - Thank you.<br> - May I?<br> - Thank you.<br> We're still all alone in the house,<br> but perhaps I could fix you some tea.<br> Don't bother, please. It was really<br> improper of me to call unannounced.<br> Why, you have a splendid<br> establishment here.<br> Well, we hope to make it one,<br> at any rate.<br> Tell me, Father Chisholm,<br> do you resent our coming here?<br> What justification could I possibly have<br> for such a feeling?<br> - None, of course. But we know, don't we, Agnes?<br> - Well, in a way.<br> You see, once we'd been upcountry<br> all by ourselves for nine years.<br> - And you've been here<br> a great deal longer than that.<br> - Then another missionary came.<br> Of course, he wasn't a Catholic,<br> but I'm afraid we did feel a little-<br> Frankly, we resented<br> his coming, Father.<br> You know, sometimes I wonder<br> how the Christian faith must appear...<br> to the Chinese mind...<br> with all the different sects<br> all crying at the same time...<br> "Come over here.<br> This is the one. This is the true one."<br> We've seen a great deal of it. We're<br> old campaigners- over 20 years in China.<br> - Over 20 years!<br> - Been a long time.<br> We're originally<br> New Englanders, from Maine.<br> Both of us born, reared,<br> married in the same town.<br> - Ever been to Maine, Father?<br> - No.<br> It doesn't sound like much-<br> little white wooden houses, birch trees...<br> huckleberries, lobster.<br> - [Sighs] It's a long way from here.<br> - This is our son, John.<br> It was taken when he was at Harvard just<br> before he went to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar.<br> He has a fine face.<br> Is he still in England?<br> Yes, he's doing settlement work.<br> Right now he's at a place called Tynecastle.<br> Tynecastle? Why, that's my home.<br> Have you ever been there?<br> Oh, yes, last year, for two weeks.<br> I have a family there, of sorts. That is,<br> an aunt and a daughter of an old friend.<br> While we were there, we had the pleasure<br> of meeting the rector ofTynecastle Cathedral...<br> Monsignor Mealey-<br> Angus Mealey. Do you know him?<br> Why, yes, very well.<br> We were boys together.<br> - Splendid man.<br> - Oh, splendid..<br> I thought him, um- um-<br> well, just a shade formal, would you say?<br> Not formal.<br> Uh, stuffy.<br> - Did you say "stuffy"?<br> - Decidedly stuffy.<br> Agnes, put that tea on the fire.<br> Father Chisholm and I are going<br> to settle down to a nice visit.<br> [Laughing]<br> It's been nice.<br> Well, thank you<br> for your hospitality...<br> and, once again,<br> welcome to Pai Tan.<br> I can't tell you how happy you've<br> made me by your friendliness.<br> I'm not a bad doctor.<br> I'm not a bad doctor.<br> Right!<br> - [Chia] Shen-fu!<br> - Mr. Chia.<br> Happy to see you.<br> Am I right in assuming that<br> the father has just encountered...<br> the newly arrived holy man<br> and his woman?<br> Yes, they're American missionaries<br> of the Protestant sect.<br> Our city seems to attract<br> more than its share of goodness.<br> For myself, I cannot imagine any mission<br> garden more pleasant to walk in than yours.<br> Thank you, my friend.<br> I remember that when Father<br> came here many years ago...<br> he received much ill treatment.<br> It may be that I will look with<br> displeasure upon these new missioners.<br> Who knows, but that<br> a series of misfortunes...<br> will befall these worshippers<br> of the false god...<br> and force them,<br> regretfully, to depart.<br> They're not worshippers<br> of the false god, Mr. Chia.<br> - It's the same true God that I serve.<br> - Incredible.<br> I would like to discuss this<br> amazing doctrine in more detail.<br> My, uh, rickshaw has room only<br> for my own miserable body.<br> Will you lower yourself<br> to permit me to walk with you?<br> It'll be a great honor.<br> I have adopted your custom of<br> greeting people by the use of the hands.<br> Perhaps in time,<br> I will find walking equally bearable.<br> [Monsignor Reading] "It is only when I look<br> back upon the pages of this journal...<br> "that I realize how time<br> flashed across me...<br> "how the years tumbled into my lap...<br> "almost too fast for me<br> to tell one from the other.<br> "How many years?<br> "Ten? Twenty?<br> "Enough, at any rate, for me to know<br> that I had grown old in my exile.<br> "I was reminded of this<br> everywhere I looked.<br> "Joseph, for instance, with three sons<br> as old, almost, as he was...<br> "in that dark hour<br> when he came to me.<br> "Now that the time had come<br> for me to go home...<br> "I spent my days<br> in memorizing every face...<br> "every stone, every tree...<br> "of my beloved mission...<br> "as if, in this way,<br> I could carry them with me.<br> "Two priests had been sent to assist me<br> and to serve in my place after my departure.<br> "Father Chou was a gentle,<br> young Chinese from the College of Pekin.<br> "Father Craig was a young,<br> but not-so-gentle American...<br> "who had been famous<br> at Notre Dame University...<br> "for playing American rugby football.<br> Sister Mary had come from Australia<br> after Sister Clothilde died. "<br> - Father?<br> - Take it away.<br> It's time for you to drink your milk.<br> Just what is the object<br> of this treatment?<br> To get me to moo like a cow<br> all the way home to Scotland?<br> Just put it down in front of him,<br> Sister Mary..<br> I'll see to it that he does<br> as he is told.<br> And why must I do<br> as Wilbur Fiske tells me?<br> Because he's your friend and your doctor<br> and knows what's best for you.<br> Well, after tomorrow, I'll be free to decide<br> for myself what I shall eat and drink.<br> I don't want to go.<br> I don't want to leave here.<br> Honestly... there is no one here<br> who's content to see you go.<br> It's difficult to remember that you've<br> been recalled for your own benefit.<br> It's difficult to think of anything...<br> but that we shall miss you so much.<br> I'm afraid I've reached the age<br> when it's easier to part with the dead...<br> than with the living.<br> A great part of my life<br> shall stay behind with you.<br> My life has been preoccupying me<br> lately now that it's almost over.<br> I've taken to rereading my journal.<br> Certainly a typical old man's weakness.<br> Hmm. How out of proportion<br> are the events of our lives...<br> to the words with which<br> we describe them.<br> No one's ever really been able<br> to write pain or love...<br> or fear or God...<br> as well as we can feel them.<br> Oh, here's a picture of Andrew.<br> Judy's little boy.<br> He is, uh-<br> How do you say? A bonny lad.<br> Oh, aye, he's bonny.<br> He has that from his grandmother,<br> from Nora.<br> What a strange continuity<br> of unhappiness that was.<br> First Nora...<br> then Judy, who lived and died<br> as wretchedly as she was born.<br> And now Andrew... deserted by his father<br> and wanted by no one but me.<br> - Who takes care of him?<br> - Oh, the woman who looked afterJudy.<br> Polly left some money,<br> and I've sent what little I had.<br> I've never been able to send for him.<br> I had to reckon with the possibility...<br> that he might arrive<br> to find me no longer here.<br> And now that I'll soon see him,<br> I realize how vain it is of me...<br> to think that it matters much<br> to him either way.<br> Well, here's an item of history.<br> "January 21, 1935.<br> Angus Mealey is now<br> the bishop ofTynecastle."<br> It was inevitable.<br> I must say that I was rather pleased<br> with my reaction to the news.<br> I would have been so disappointed<br> if I'd been jealous.<br> But I wasn't, and I'm not.<br> - I'm truly happy for Angus.<br> - I'm sure he is too.<br> You see?<br> I've long been aware of the difference<br> between Angus and me.<br> Angus is a man of great presence<br> and great charm...<br> at ease everywhere and with everyone.<br> I've had scarcely more than,<br> oh, six friends in all my life.<br> And those, except for one...<br> were humble folk.<br> I suppose it should make me sad to think<br> of how much he's made of his life...<br> and how little I've made of mine.<br> I've bumped my head<br> so often and so hard...<br> in my strivings after God.<br> I mean no disrespect to your bishop...<br> but it is my personal opinion...<br> that you are closer to God than he.<br> Twilights come earlier these days.<br> The summer and I are almost gone.<br> And how shall I write this latest...<br> and saddest entry of them all?<br> On this day...<br> I said good-bye to<br> Reverend Mother Maria-Veronica.<br> How does one say good-bye<br> to a friend...<br> with whom one has shared<br> disappointments... and accomplishments...<br> of almost a lifetime?<br> Who'd worked together<br> for so many years-<br> through revolution,<br> pestilence, famine and poverty-<br> and had come to know each other<br> very well?<br> When I insisted that I didn't<br> want to leave my mission...<br> she made me foolishly happy<br> by encouraging my rebellion.<br> And yet both of us knew that we could<br> not consider our own preferences...<br> against the manifest wisdom<br> of the appointment...<br> and that- to quote the wisest man<br> I've ever known-<br> we would<br> "let Almighty God have his way."<br> And may that Almighty God<br> watch over her...<br> and bless her and keep her...<br> and bless her and keep her...<br> always.<br> My dear friend...<br> I shall never forget you.<br> You young idiot,<br> what have you been up to?<br> Sorry, Father.
