Maybe.<br> Someone took my knife.<br> So what were they like?<br> They were<br> really sweet kids.<br> The boy was this little,<br> you know, kind of<br> sensitive jock-type kid,<br> and the girl was<br> really innocent<br> but just whip-smart<br> and super, super cute.<br> Sounds like you<br> really liked them,<br> like you guys connected.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> Yeah, I kind of did.<br> Wow.<br> So how'd you leave it?<br> I mean, are you<br> gonna see them again?<br> I... Hey, Brooke.<br> Hey, Paul.<br> Check these out.<br> - How you doing?<br> - Good.<br> Wow, look at those<br> strawberries, man.<br> They're just...<br> Aren't they beautiful?<br> I thought you should<br> have the first taste.<br> Thank you.<br> "I thought you should<br> have the first taste"<br> of my pussy.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Dude, I don't even<br> think they smoke pot.<br> Dude, hold up.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Seriously.<br> Oh! Dude!<br> God, disgusting!<br> Come on, let's go.<br> It's alive, dude!<br> Put it back.<br> Fine, fine, fine.<br> Sweet!<br> Dude, we're watching this.<br> You think the whole<br> thing's like this?<br> Maybe...<br> Maybe we should<br> fast forward.<br> Laser, you left your bike<br> in the driveway again.<br> Laser, your mom<br> and I accept and love<br> you unconditionally.<br> You know that, right?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah. And you know that<br> you can be open with us<br> about anything.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Okay.<br> Laser, do you<br> want to talk to us<br> about anything?<br> Like what?<br> J ust anything.<br> You know, anything<br> on your mind.<br> Well, there is something.<br> But it's more of<br> a question, though.<br> That's okay.<br> We won't judge you.<br> Why do you guys<br> watch gay man porn?<br> Well, first I have to say<br> that we rarely watch<br> that movie.<br> Honey.<br> And, second,<br> I really don't<br> appreciate<br> you snooping around<br> our room, okay?<br> Was that Clay's idea?<br> No, Mom.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I have to say, again,<br> I don't like him.<br> I know. I know.<br> Okay, he seems unstable.<br> Honey, honey,<br> that's not what he asked.<br> Do you want to answer<br> his question?<br> Yeah, okay.<br> Well, sweetie, you know,<br> human sexuality<br> is complicated.<br> And sometimes desire can be,<br> you know, counterintuitive.<br> You know, for example,<br> because women's<br> sexual responsiveness<br> is internalized,<br> sometimes it's exciting<br> for us to see responsiveness<br> externalized,<br> like with a...<br> Like with a penis.<br> Wouldn't you guys<br> just rather watch girls<br> doing it, though?<br> Well, you would think that.<br> But usually in these movies,<br> they hire two straight<br> women to pretend,<br> and the inauthenticity<br> is just unbearable.<br> Whoa, that's enough.<br> Laser, your mom<br> and I sense<br> that there's some<br> other stuff going on<br> in your life.<br> We just want<br> to be let in.<br> What do you mean?<br> Are you having a relationship<br> with someone?<br> You can tell us, honey.<br> We would understand<br> and support you.<br> Look, I only met him once.<br> What do you mean once?<br> - Did he find you online?<br> - Wait.<br> What?<br> Wait, wait, who did<br> you meet once?<br> Paul. I met him with Joni.<br> Paul? Who's Paul?<br> Why was Joni there?<br> She set it up.<br> Wait, forget the set-up.<br> Who's Paul?<br> Our sperm donor.<br> Did you guys think<br> I was gay?<br> No.<br> No way.<br> Of course not.<br> Yeah, I mean, we understand<br> that you'd be curious<br> about your biological father.<br> I mean,<br> it's completely natural.<br> But why didn't you tell us?<br> Because we knew<br> you'd be upset.<br> We're not upset!<br> No, no, no.<br> We're not. We wish that<br> you'd included us in<br> the conversation.<br> That's all.<br> You know? But...<br> But you met him,<br> and that's cool.<br> And now,<br> we can move on.<br> Actually,<br> I want to see him again.<br> You do?<br> Yeah, I was<br> gonna tell you.<br> Well, no. Okay?<br> No way.<br> No one's seeing anyone<br> until we meet him.<br> I get it, okay?<br> He's their biological father<br> and all that crap.<br> But it still feels<br> really shitty.<br> Like we're not enough<br> or something, you know?<br> Of course I know.<br> You know, I don't...<br> I don't want to time-share<br> our kids with anybody.<br> Especially when<br> it's Joni's last summer<br> at home.<br> No way.<br> Jesus, Jules!<br> The plumber was just here.<br> God, it's gross.<br> Look, we have to be<br> smart about this.<br> You know, if we act like<br> grubby bitches, we're just<br> gonna make it worse.<br> I know.<br> Let's just kill him<br> with kindness<br> and put it to bed.<br> I'm with you, honey.<br> We're gonna get<br> through this, okay?<br> I love you, chicken.<br> I love you, too, pony.<br> Paul. It's so great<br> to meet you. H i. Yeah.<br> Great to meet you, too.<br> Hey. Jules.<br> Hello, Jules.<br> I'm Nic.<br> Hi, Nic.<br> Hi.<br> I hope the traffic<br> wasn't too bad.<br> No, I took my motorcycle,<br> so I pretty much just<br> weave through it.<br> Oh, great.<br> I brought you this.<br> I don't know if<br> you folks drink wine.<br> Oh, no, are you kidding?<br> We love it.<br> Wow, a Petite Sirah.<br> What a treat!<br> '86.<br> Yeah.

Yeah, great.<br> Go easy on the wine, hon.<br> It's daytime.<br> Okay. Same goes<br> for the micromanaging.<br> Okay?<br> So, Paul, did you<br> always know that...<br> Yes.<br> ...that you wanted to be<br> in the food services industry?<br> I always liked food.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> No, I was asking<br> because I remember when<br> I was reading your file,<br> back when we were<br> looking for,<br> you know, sperm...<br> Can I have the potato<br> salad, babe?<br> Sure.<br> Anyway, you said<br> that you were studying<br> international relations.<br> Oh, yeah. Wow, that was a...<br> That was a long time ago.<br> Yeah, I was considering it,<br> but then I dropped out<br> of school.<br> You dropped<br> out of college?<br> Yeah, it just<br> wasn't my thing.<br> - No? Why's that?<br> - I don't know.<br> It just seemed like<br> a massive waste of money<br> after a while, you know?<br> I was just sitting<br> on my ass listening<br> to people spout ideas<br> I could just as easily<br> have learned in a book.<br> Oh.<br> Okay.<br> I'm not saying that,<br> you know,<br> I think that higher learning<br> uniformly blows.<br> You know, I think<br> college is great<br> for some people.<br> Joni, I'm sure<br> you're gonna love it.<br> But just... I'm a doer.<br> That's how I learn.<br> It's just me.<br> I'm weird that way, I guess.<br> Thank you.<br> Which is probably why<br> I'm in the food services<br> industry.<br> Right.<br> Hey, Mom,<br> you see what he did<br> there, right?<br> You said "food<br> services industry,"<br> so then he said<br> "food services industry."<br> Yeah. I got that,<br> Laser. Thanks.<br> So, Paul,<br> what about your...<br> What about<br> your social life?<br> My social life?<br> Yeah, you know,<br> are you married, divorced,<br> seeing anyone?<br> - Mom.<br> - What?<br> We're getting<br> to know Paul.<br> It's okay.<br> No, no, it's okay. I...<br> No, I've never been<br> married nor divorced.<br> I date sometimes,<br> but I'm really just<br> kind of focused on my<br> restaurant right now.<br> - Well, that's...<br> - Yeah. Makes sense.<br> So, cheers.<br> Yeah. Cheers.<br> Excellent wine,<br> by the way.<br> Thank you.<br> How old are you again?<br> You must be the<br> griller of the family.<br> Yeah.<br> No, that's okay.<br> I like<br> to be positive.<br> Yeah.<br> So how'd you two meet?<br> We met at UCLA.<br> I was a resident,<br> and Jules had<br> an emergency.<br> My tongue was numb.<br> Really? Your tongue?<br> Laser.<br> Oh, my God.<br> It's not nice.<br> No, that's not nice.<br> I mean, we've heard<br> that story 100, 000 times.<br> What happened<br> to your tongue?<br> I don't know.<br> I mean, I lost all<br> the feeling in my face<br> and my tongue.<br> And then, you know, I got<br> really nervous 'cause<br> I thought that I was gonna gag<br> and, you know,<br> maybe like...<br> Choke? Die?<br> Yeah, exactly.<br> What'd you do to help her?<br> I gave her a Valium,<br> and I told her to relax<br> and tried to get her to talk,<br> you know,<br> move her tongue around.<br> Yeah.<br> Actually,<br> she started teasing me,<br> and that really helped.<br> I was trying<br> to distract you.<br> I know. It worked.<br> You were really funny.<br> You were really pretty.<br> And then, you know,<br> my tongue started<br> working again.<br> - Sure.<br> - God, Mom, please.<br> Yeah.<br> Wow, we've been glued<br> at the hip ever since.<br> - Yeah.<br> - No doubt.<br> Yeah. Great. Great story.<br> Yeah, we like it.<br> So, N ic, you,<br> you're a doctor,<br> I know that.<br> But what are<br> you into, Jules?<br> What do you do?<br> Well, you know,<br> I mean, I studied<br> architecture in college.<br> Right.<br> But I'm not<br> really an architect.<br> I mean, I was on my way<br> to becoming one,<br> but I quit before<br> the kids were born.<br> That happens.<br> And then when they got<br> a little bit older,<br> I started<br> a Balinese furniture<br> import business.<br> Right on.<br> But that didn't<br> really work out.<br> Yeah,<br> businesses aren't easy.<br> Yeah.<br> But I'm in the process<br> of starting a new business.<br> Great, good for you.<br> What's that?<br> Landscape design.<br> I mean, you know,<br> not gardening.<br> I mean, you know,<br> there's a gardening<br> component,<br> but, really, the real work<br> is in creating unique,<br> eco-friendly spaces<br> that, you know,<br> the surrounding,<br> that blend, you know,<br> with the surrounding<br> environment.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Definitely.<br> Most definitely.<br> Yeah.<br> Hey, Joni, did you<br> tell Paul about your<br> graduation speech?<br> No, she didn't tell me.<br> It was so full of<br> wisdom and hope.<br> Yeah.<br> Hey, go get it.<br> You know, I bet Paul<br> would like to hear it.<br> No, Mom,<br> I'm sure he wouldn't.<br> No, no, no,<br> sure he would.<br> Go on, go get it.<br> No, I don't want to.<br> Sweetie,<br> don't be embarrassed.<br> Mom, I'm not embarrassed.<br> Jesus, give it a rest.<br> J ust let it go.<br> I'm gonna get<br> some ice cream.<br> I'll help.<br> Okay.<br> Honey, it's your<br> fourth glass.<br> Actually, it's my third.<br> But, you know,<br> thanks for counting.<br> Hey, I was...<br> You know, I was thinking.<br> I just bought this place<br> last year, and it's...<br> I mean,<br> the backyard's a wreck.<br> Would you be interested<br> in maybe coming and doing<br> some work for me?<br> That's okay.<br> - No, seriously.<br> - I can't...<br> I don't have time<br> to do it myself and...<br> Well, I mean,<br> that's really sweet of you,<br> but you should think<br> about it, you know.<br> - No, why?<br> - I just did.<br> I mean, it's all right<br> if you're not up for it.<br> It's okay.<br> No, I am.<br> I'm up for it. Yeah.<br> Yeah?

But he's not<br> just a client, Jules.<br> He's our sperm donor.<br> I mean, haven't you<br> heard the expression<br> "don't shit where you eat"?<br> Yes, and I think<br> it's disgusting.<br> Okay, I'm sorry.<br> Look, he just seemed<br> so self-satisfied to me.<br> You know?<br> Yeah, he was working<br> the "alternative" thing<br> pretty hard.<br> Oh, my God.<br> When he said<br> that thing about,<br> "Oh, I just need to get<br> outside and do things,<br> not sit on my ass and learn.<br> "But that's just me, you know.<br> I'm weird that way."<br> I'd certainly clean up<br> a lot of this grass.<br> It's pretty... It's wasted.<br> Sure.<br> The lavender<br> is so nice.<br> And with the sun that<br> you have, that and,<br> like, that rosemary,<br> which kind of grow everywhere,<br> and you wouldn't even have<br> to think about it.<br> Yeah.<br> You could go like a whole,<br> like, Secret Garden,<br> kind of a trellis-y,<br> like hidden kind of thing.<br> Or you could, you know,<br> you could go like Asian-y.<br> Minimal. You know, like rocks<br> and kind of all clean and...<br> Whatever you think.<br> Well,<br> what do you think?<br> You know what? I'm not...<br> I'm not feeling minimal.<br> I really...

Nothing.<br> Paul's just giving me some<br> child-rearing lessons.<br> I'm just saying...<br> Listen, when you've been<br> a parent for 18 years,<br> you come and talk to me, okay?<br> I'm just making<br> an observation.<br> Yeah?

Look,<br> I was upset, okay?<br> You know how I feel<br> about motorcycles.<br> Yeah, I know how<br> you feel about them.<br> But I'm an adult now,<br> and you have to respect<br> that, okay?<br> Good night.<br> Good?

I mean,<br> you're just gonna be<br> taking up more<br> space in the earth.<br> I don't know.<br> The idea of being,<br> you know,<br> torched into a chalky<br> white substance has got me<br> a little freaked out.<br> Why does it matter to you?<br> You're not even<br> gonna be conscious.<br> Okay, well, maybe,<br> I don't know,<br> I want a place<br> for people to come<br> and visit me one day.<br> But why?<br> You're gonna be dead.<br> You won't even<br> know they're there.<br> Okay.
