What do you call it?<br> - Brentwood.<br> Did you ever hear of Brentwood?<br> What do you do here nights?<br> They eat their dinner.<br> They all come here and<br> eat the big dinner.<br> - That's right.<br> - You're a pretty bright boy, aren't you?<br> - Sure.<br> - Well, you're not. Is he, Al?<br> He's dumb.<br> Hey, you, what's your name?<br> Adams. Nick Adams.<br> - Another bright boy.<br> - The town's full of bright boys.<br> One ham and, one bacon and.<br> - Which one is yours?<br> - Don't you remember, bright boy?<br> What are you laughing at?<br> - Nothing.<br> - You see something funny?<br> - No.<br> - Then don't laugh.<br> All right.<br> - He thinks it's all right.<br> - Oh, he's a thinker.<br> What's the bright boy's<br> name down the counter?<br> I forget.<br> - Hey.<br> - Yeah?<br> You go around the other<br> side of the counter.<br> - What?<br> - You heard me.<br> - What's the idea?<br> - There isn't any idea.<br> Better go around, bright boy.<br> Who's out in the kitchen?<br> - Only the cook.<br> - Tell him to come in.<br> - Say, where do you...<br> - Use your head!<br> Tell the cook to come out here.<br> - Sam.<br> - Yeah?<br> Come here.<br> What was it?<br> I'm going out to the kitchen<br> with him and bright boy.<br> Come on back, you two.<br> If anybody comes in,<br> you tell 'em the cook is off.<br> What's it all about?<br> Hey, Al, bright boy wants<br> to know what it's all about.<br> - Why don't you tell him?<br> - What do you think it's all about?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What do you think?<br> I wouldn't say.<br> Hey, Al, bright boy says he wouldn't<br> say what he thinks it's all about.<br> Hey, you. Come here.<br> I'll tell you what's gonna happen.<br> We're gonna kill the Swede.<br> You know the big Swede works<br> over at that filling station?<br> You mean Pete Lunn?<br> If that's what he calls himself.<br> - Comes in every night at 6:00, don't he?<br> - Yes, if he comes.<br> We know all about that.<br> What are you going to kill him for?<br> What did Pete Lunn ever do to you?<br> He never had a chance<br> to do anything to us.<br> - He never even seen us.<br> - He's only going to see us once.<br> What are you going to kill him for?<br> - We're killing him for a friend.<br> - Shut up. You talk too much.<br> I got to keep bright<br> boy amused, don't I?<br> What are you going to<br> do with us afterwards?<br> That'll depend.<br> That's one of those things<br> you never know at the time.<br> - Hello, George.<br> - Hello, Fred.<br> - Can I have supper?<br> - Sam's out.<br> He'll be back in about half an hour.<br> Oh. Well, maybe I<br> better go up the street.<br> - Sorry.<br> - That's all right.<br> That was nice, bright boy.<br> You're a regular little gentleman.<br> Lunn won't be in tonight.<br> - What makes you think so?<br> - It's after six.<br> If he comes, it's always before six.<br> Hear that, Al? Bright boy says he don't<br> think the Swede's going to show up.<br> Sorry, but we're not serving.<br> - Why not?<br> - The cook's away. He's sick.<br> Then why don't you get another cook?<br> Are you running a lunch<br> counter or aren't you?<br> You, bright boy.<br> That on the level about the<br> Swede not showin' up tonight?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You wouldn't fool us, would you?<br> When he's not here by<br> six, he's not coming.<br> No, he ain't fooling.<br> He'd know better than to fool.<br> - Come on, Al.<br> - What about those two back there?<br> Bright boy, here.<br> - They're all right.<br> - Think so?<br> Sure.<br> You got a lot of luck, bright boy.<br> That's the truth.<br> You ought to play the races.<br> Oh, dear.<br> I'm glad we're all alive.<br> This never happened<br> in this town before.<br> I don't like it. I don't<br> like any part of it.<br> It's all right, Sam. They<br> were going to kill Pete Lunn.<br> They were going to shoot him<br> when he came in to dinner.<br> - The Swede?<br> - Yes.<br> I don't get it. Why would<br> anyone want to kill the Swede?<br> They've gone over to the station. They'll<br> probably get his address from the daybook.<br> Nick.<br> You work with the Swede.<br> You better go and tell him.<br> - I'm going for the cops.<br> - You better go tell the Swede first.<br> Swede!<br> I was over at Henry's. A couple of guys<br> came in and tied up me and the cook.<br> They shoved us in the kitchen.<br> They said they were going to shoot you<br> when you came in to supper.<br> George thought I ought<br> to come over and tell you.<br> - There's nothing I can do about it.<br> - I can tell you what they look like.<br> I don't want to know what<br> they're like. Thanks for coming.<br> Don't you want me to<br> go and see the police?<br> - No. That wouldn't do any good.<br> - Isn't there something I could do?<br> - There ain't anything to do.<br> - Couldn't you get out of town?<br> No. I'm through with all<br> that runnin' around.<br> Why do they want to kill you?<br> I did something wrong once.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> Yeah. That's all right.<br> Brentwood Police Station.<br> The chief is busy now.<br> He'll call you back.<br> The way I look at it, this killing doesn't<br> rightly concern Brentwood at all.<br> What concerns us is protecting the<br> lives and property of our citizens.<br> This man Lunn lived here, that's all.<br> The killers came from out of town,<br> and they were here looking for Lunn.<br> They ain't gunning for<br> anyone else in town.<br> They made their getaway,<br> and what happens to 'em from here<br> on in is up to the state police.<br> - It's out of our hands.<br> - This is what I'm looking for.<br> "Beneficiary: Mary Ellen Daugherty.<br> Palms Hotel, Atlantic City." Relative?<br> Haven't checked yet.<br> Souvenir, I guess.<br> Yeah. Could be.<br> - What do you know about Lunn?<br> - Not much.<br> Came here about a year ago.<br> Lived at a boardinghouse out on<br> Spruce Street. Mrs. Hirsch's.<br> Never made any friends, as far as I can<br> make out. Kept pretty much to himself.<br> Ma Hirsch says she can't ever<br> remember him getting any mail even.<br> Well?<br> - They weren't any of these guys.<br> - That's for certain.<br> These two boys saw the killers. They came<br> into Henry's Diner looking for Lunn.<br> Said right out they were gonna<br> kill him when he came in.<br> Just happened Nick Adams<br> was in the place that night.<br> He and Lunn worked together<br> at the filling station.<br> I ought to be getting back on the job. If<br> you're done with me for now, I'd better go.<br> - You can go.<br> - Say, Adams.<br> What kind of a fellow was the Swede?<br> It's okay, Nick. Mr. Riordan's<br> from the insurance company.<br> Ah, he wasn't a bad sort of fellow.<br> You got along with him<br> all right on the job?<br> Sure. Easy enough to get along with.<br> Uh-huh. Think I'll have<br> a look at the body.<br> Right. Nick, you take Mr. Riordan<br> down to Pluthner and introduce him.<br> Mr. Pluthner's in charge<br> of our county morgue.<br> Thanks. I'd like to have<br> a chat with Nick anyway.<br> Anything else I can do, let me know.<br> I'd like a copy of the report<br> on Lunn's fingerprints soon...<br> - as you get it from Washington.<br> - I'll send it right on to you.<br> - Fine. Mind if I keep this?<br> - Keep it. Sure.<br> Thanks again.<br> Tell me, Nick, the last time you<br> and the Swede were together...<br> Hello, Nick. What's on your mind?<br> Mr. Pluthner, this is Mr. Riordan.<br> The chief asked me to bring him down.<br> I'm with the Atlantic<br> Casualty Company.<br> Tri-States Oil carries a group<br> policy with us on its employees.<br> - Lunn worked for them.<br> - Well, the policy is now payable.<br> Got eight slugs in him.<br> Near tore him in half.<br> - "Once I did something wrong."<br> - Huh?<br> Those were his last<br> words to Nick here.<br> I wonder what he meant.<br> "Once I did something wrong."<br> I don't know, but it was<br> something a long time ago.<br> - How do you know that?<br> - Just the way he said it.<br> Like it was something<br> happened a long time back.<br> Did the Swede eat his supper<br> at the diner every night?<br> Yeah.<br> I wonder why he didn't show<br> the night the killers were there.<br> He'd been staying home for a<br> few days. He didn't feel so good.<br> - What was the matter with him?<br> - I don't know.<br> Stomach or something.<br> It started Thursday, a week ago.<br> I was at the filling station.<br> About an hour before closing,<br> a guy drives in in a big black car.<br> Caddy, I think it was.<br> - Fill 'er up. Ethyl.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hey, you!<br> Look at the oil, will ya?<br> It's okay.<br> Check the rear tires.<br> Wipe the windshield.<br> This town got a name?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What is it?<br> - Brentwood.<br> - Brentwood?<br> - 3.83 with the tax.<br> - Here, kid. Thanks.<br> Thank you.<br> Brentwood, huh?<br> Nick, you close up. I'm going home.<br> What's the matter, Swede?<br> Are you sick?<br> Yeah.<br> I feel kind of sick.<br> And he walked off<br> rubbing his stomach,<br> and he didn't come to work next day.<br> Only time I knew him to miss a day.<br> You didn't notice the license<br> plates on the car, did you?<br> It was an out-of-state car, though.<br> Illinois, I think,<br> or maybe Pennsylvania.<br> And the man in the car,<br> what did he look like?<br> Well, he was kind of heavyset.<br> Had a mustache.<br> Look, mister, if you don't mind,<br> I'm feelin' kind of sick myself.<br> Yeah.<br> I want to call Newark, honey.<br> Market 3-2-600.<br> Uh, Brentwood 2-7-7.<br> This is Riordan. Let me<br> have my office, please.<br> Hello, Stella? I'm still<br> up in Brentwood. Yeah.<br> I've had some postmortem photographs<br> made of this fellow Lunn.<br> I'm sending you in a print. He's got<br> broken knuckles, a fighter's hands.<br> Have one of the boys take the<br> picture over to Kelly's gym.<br> See if anyone there can identify him.<br> Get me anything you can on the guy.<br> What? Oh, that can wait<br> till I come in tomorrow.<br> Well, tell the boys I've taken<br> a run down to Atlantic City.<br> I want to interview<br> Lunn's beneficiary.<br> Around here, Mr. Riordan,<br> they all call Mary Ellen "Queenie."<br> She should be here any minute.<br> She's usually home<br> from church by now.<br> There she is.<br> Queenie, will you come here a minute?<br> This is Mr. Riordan.<br> Hello, Queenie.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Grimes.<br> - Sit down, Queenie.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> I have news for you. It may<br> be good, it may be bad,<br> according to your feeling<br> for the deceased.<br> - Oh, did somebody die, sir?<br> - Pete Lunn.<br> - Who, sir?<br> - Pete Lunn.<br> Oh, I know no one of that name.<br> Well, you must have known him, Queenie.<br> You're his beneficiary.<br> His what, sir?<br> His life was insured for $2,500.<br> It's payable to you.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, there must be some mistake.<br> Nobody would be leaving<br> me that much money.<br> There aren't any other Mary Ellen<br> Daughertys employed here, are there?<br> No, sir.<br> Oh. Him it is!<br> - Who?<br> - Oh, the man in 1212.<br> But... But his name was never Lunn.<br> It was, um, uh, Nelson.<br> That's who that is.<br> That's Mr. Nelson.<br> And you only knew him<br> as a guest in the hotel?<br> Yes, sir. Oh, but that was years ago.<br> The year of the hurricane.<br> I remember because it was when<br> my sister's youngest was born.<br> Was it a natural death he<br> was dying, Mr. Riordan?<br> No, Queenie. He was murdered.<br> Murder, you say?<br> How long did Mr. Nelson,<br> as you call him, stay here?<br> Well, I couldn't say exactly, sir,<br> but no longer than a few days.<br> And you never saw him before<br> those few days or after?<br> Never, sir.<br> Why do you suppose he made<br> his insurance payable to you?<br> For the life of me, sir...<br> Murder, it was?<br> Tsk, tsk, tsk. Poor Mr. Nelson.<br> Well, there's one thing<br> to be thankful for.<br> He can sleep in consecrated ground.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> - The sin was not on his own soul.<br> Why did you think<br> he'd killed himself?<br> Well, sir, now maybe<br> I shouldn't be tellin' it.<br> No, go ahead, Queenie.<br> Well, sir, I was makin' my rounds.<br> I was on night duty then,<br> turnin' down the beds,<br> and I came into 1212.<br> Oh! It was a sight to behold!<br> She's gone.<br> - She's gone!<br> - Who's gone, mister?<br> Don't do it, mister!<br> Mister, don't! Please, mister.<br> Oh, if you did, you'd never<br> see the face of God.<br> You'd burn in hell to the end of time.<br> Oh, you mustn't, mister.<br> Oh, blessed Mother of God,<br> help me. Oh, please.<br> She's gone!<br> Charleston was right. He was right.<br> Charleston was right.<br> Atlantic Casualty, claim department.<br> There's your party. Go ahead.<br> - Good morning, Stella.<br> - Good morning, dream boy.<br> - Mr. Kenyon wants to see you.<br> - What about the Swede? Pete Lunn.<br> - Oh, my notes aren't transcribed yet.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - You sent for me?<br> - What are you working on?<br> - The Lunn case.<br> - That one of those $2,500 death benefits?<br> - That's right.<br> - Forget it.<br> - There's a damaged freight claim...<br> - Ever hear of anyone called Charleston?<br> Charleston.<br> There was a petty-larceny thief. Why?<br> Does a green handkerchief decorated<br> with golden harps mean anything to you?<br> What are you talking about,<br> a green handkerchief?<br> Did you ever try to remember<br> something like somebody's name,<br> have it on the tip of your tongue almost,<br> then, just as you're about to say it,<br> - lose it?<br> - I guess so.<br> Well, that's how it is with me<br> and this green handkerchief.<br> - It's real silk. Whose was it?<br> - The dead man's.<br> Listen. I'm trying to<br> run an organization.<br> The number of claims piled up here...<br> I could use six other investigators<br> and still be behind.<br> And you're off fooling around<br> with a two-for-a-nickel shooting.<br> But this isn't a<br> two-for-a-nickel shooting.<br> Two professional killers<br> show up in a small town...<br> and put the blast on a filling<br> station attendant, a nobody.<br> There was no attempt at robbery.<br> They were out for only one thing.<br> To kill him. Why?<br> I don't know. And what's<br> more, I don't care.<br> Here, get to work on these.<br> Give me a couple of more days.<br> Maybe a bell will ring.<br> I'd fire you if I didn't know you'd go right<br> over to more money at the Prudential.<br> Go ahead. One more day.<br> Never mind typing it up. You can<br> do that later. Read it to me, huh?<br> Kelly's gym was a good hunch.<br> "Real name: Ole Anderson.<br> Born: Philadelphia, June 23, 1908.<br> "Mother died 1909. Father employed<br> by Philadelphia Transit Company.<br> "Died: 1916. Started fighting<br> professionally in 1928.<br> "Weight: 173.<br> Last fight: Philadelphia<br> Sports Arena, October 1935."<br> I knew those hands were no accident.<br> "Three years later, October 1938,<br> arrested in Philadelphia for robbery.<br> "Sentenced to three years of<br> hard labor by Justice Reagan.<br> Released for good behavior in May<br> of '40." That's all I could get.<br> That's enough. Look, call up Reynolds<br> on the ledger. Give him the story.<br> He's done good turns for us.<br> And try and see if you can locate an<br> old-time thief named Charleston, will you?<br> Oh, by the way, who made<br> that pinch on Anderson?<br> Detective Lieutenant Lubinsky.<br> Philadelphia, fifth precinct.<br> Uh-huh. See you later.<br> - Sam!<br> - Yes?<br> - Someone to see you.<br> - Out here.<br> - Lieutenant Lubinsky?<br> - That's right.<br> What can I do for you?<br> Sit down, Mr. Riordan.<br> It's all right. They're dry.<br> I don't know whether you remember,<br> but you once arrested a<br> man named Ole Anderson.<br> - I remember.<br> - Well, he's been murdered.<br> - Insured with your company?<br> - Yes.<br> Okay, what do you want to know?<br> Anything you can tell me.<br> I can tell you almost everything about<br> Ole up until the last few years.<br> This was his stamping ground?<br> Came from the 12th ward,<br> right here in Philly. Both of us did.<br> His old man and mine worked together.<br> His was a motorman, mine a conductor.<br> Ole and I ran around<br> together when we were kids.<br> I joined the department. He started<br> fightin'. We always kept in touch.<br> And you put the pinch on him?<br> When you're a copper,<br> you're a copper.<br> Seems like I was always in<br> there when he was losing.<br> Did you ever see him fight?<br> I don't think so.<br> Not that I remember.<br> He was pretty good.<br> Take an awful lot of punishment.<br> Yeah. I saw his first<br> fight and I saw his last,<br> though I didn't get there till<br> the start of the last round.<br> He was fightin' Tiger Lewis.<br> Hiya, Lieutenant.<br> All right, seconds out. Come on,<br> fella, let's clear the ring. Outside.<br> Now use your right, Swede.<br> He's wide open, and it's the last round.<br> Keep throwin' your right.<br> Hello, Pete. Has he got a chance?<br> He's gettin' murdered. Can't last.<br> Your right, Swede.<br> Let go with your right.<br> Break it up, boys. Step back.<br> One, two, three,<br> - four, five, six,<br> - Take nine, Swede. Take nine.<br> seven, eight, nine...<br> What's the matter with you, Swede?<br> Use your right! Your right!<br> One, two, three,<br> four, five, six,<br> seven...<br> The winner!<br> Hey, Swede. Swede?<br> Do you know who I am?<br> - Uhh.<br> - Who am I?<br> - You're... You're...<br> - Say who I am.<br> Who am I? Say my name.<br> Take a look at that hand.<br> Gee. No wonder he<br> didn't throw his right.<br> Hey, Doc. In there, please.<br> Take a look at this.<br> Have him come into my office<br> in the morning for an x-ray.<br> - No wonder.<br> - What round's comin' up?<br> The fight's over, Swede.<br> Yeah. You'd better get<br> him under the shower.<br> - He's fought his last fight.<br> - Yeah. Just my luck.<br> Well, he wasn't no Mickey Walker or no<br> Rosenbloom, but he'd done all right.<br> I figure I'm out about ten G's.<br> That ain't hay for me these days.<br> How you doing, Ole?<br> - What happened?<br> - You were on the deck when the bell rang.<br> Yeah?<br> See that he gets hot<br> and cold compresses...<br> on that hand tonight to<br> take the swelling down.<br> Swelling down, swelling up.<br> It don't make no difference now.<br> Ah, cheer up, Packy.<br> There's more where he came from.<br> Ten G's is ten G's.<br> How'd ya like that Irish kid that was<br> fourth on the card? That Callahan.<br> He's a powerhouse, that boy.<br> Wagner's got him.<br> I bet you could buy Callahan off<br> Wagner for two, three hundred.<br> Anyway, it won't go down in the<br> record books as a K.O., will it?<br> That's right, Ole.<br> There's no use hanging around here.<br> I never did like wakes. Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Yeah, good night, fellas.<br> I bet you that Callahan would<br> get your ten G's back for you.<br> That guy was a cinch.<br> I could have taken him easy<br> if my right had been workin'.<br> Well, next time.<br> There isn't gonna be a next time.<br> What do you mean, no next time?<br> You might as well know it right now.<br> - You're through.<br> - Huh?<br> That hand will never be<br> good again. Not for fighting.<br> - Who said so?<br> - The doc, for one.<br> Maybe he's wrong.<br> He's not wrong, Ole.<br> The bones are all broken.<br> Well, they can mend, can't they?<br> Not so's you can hit a toy balloon<br> without breakin' 'em all over again.<br> No. You're done fightin', Ole.<br> And if you want my opinion, it's a<br> lucky thing. You aren't punchy yet.<br> Suppose it was your brains were<br> scrambled instead of your hand.<br> I ain't quittin'.<br> It's not quittin' if<br> your hand's gone.<br> - I stayed the limit, didn't I?<br> - That's right.<br> They can't take that away from you.<br> - Want to eat?<br> - Yeah.<br> Last time there were<br> just waitin' to shake this.<br> Funny when you<br> lose a fight, ain't it?<br> - Hello, Lilly.<br> - Oh.<br> Hi. Hello, Swede. You all right?<br> Yeah.<br> I guess you don't feel like<br> much celebration tonight.<br> Maybe you'd like to come over to<br> my house. I'll cook up something to eat.<br> Well, Lilly, I'll tell you.<br> Right now, I'm... I'm not hungry.<br> - You invited the wrong guy.<br> - Ah, you. You were born hungry.<br> Did you see the fight?<br> I was in my regular seat.<br> I didn't notice tonight.<br> Hey, what was the<br> matter with your right?<br> He hurt it.<br> Too bad, Ole.<br> You'd have taken him sure.<br> Yeah.<br> - Well, Lilly, I...<br> - I know, Ole.<br> Guess I better be going on home.<br> - Yeah, I'll call you up tomorrow.<br> - Okay.<br> - Good night, Sam.<br> - I'll be seeing you, Lilly.<br> What am I going to<br> do if I quit fightin'?<br> Well, there's always the department.<br> No, I wouldn't want to be a copper.<br> It's not a bad life, Ole. Twenty<br> years and you've got a pension.<br> And it's $2,200 a year to start.<br> $2,200 a year.<br> You know something?<br> Some months I made that<br> much in one month.<br> Some months.<br> After that I didn't see much of Ole.<br> It wasn't my fault.<br> Just one of those things.<br> - Sam!<br> - Yes?<br> Open the door.<br> Whew! It's getting muggy.<br> Thought you might like some lemonade.<br> Swell. This is Mr. Riordan.<br> - My wife.<br> - How are you?<br> - We were just talking about Ole.<br> - Poor boy.<br> - You knew him, Mr. Riordan?<br> - No.<br> Mr. Riordan is<br> investigating his death.<br> He was a good boy.<br> No one had any call to kill him.<br> Lilly knew Ole too. The three of us<br> were together a good part of the time.<br> - She was always in love with him.<br> - Sam!<br> And I was always in love with her.<br> Worked out fine for me anyway.<br> I haven't been too unhappy myself.<br> How recently had you seen<br> the Swede, Mrs. Lubinsky?<br> - Oh, not since Sam and I got married.<br> - Just about nine years ago.<br> September the 26th. Ole was best man.<br> It was about six months<br> before that that Ole and I,<br> well, uh, stopped seeing each other.<br> - Just about.<br> - Why was that?<br> I don't mean to be out of line,<br> but your husband will tell you,<br> we have so little to work on.<br> Anything may help.<br> Oh, I don't mind telling you,<br> though it's not very flattering.<br> Ole and I had a date<br> to go to the movies.<br> At least, I thought that's<br> where we were going...<br> until we went into this hotel.<br> - Who's giving this party?<br> - Some guy lives here.<br> - Jake gave us the invite.<br> - Jake who?<br> Jake, the fella I introduced you to<br> in the restaurant the other night.<br> - Oh. I don't like him.<br> - Why?<br> He's got mean eyes.<br> Him and me may be<br> going into business.<br> Look, honey, you go on ahead.<br> I got a headache.<br> Since when? Aw, come on.<br> You'll have a good time.<br> Hello. Come in, folks. Come in.<br> - Swede, good to see you.<br> - How's it, Jake?<br> Fine, fine.<br> And it's good to see<br> the little lady too.<br> - What was your name again, honey?<br> - Miss Harmon.<br> Miss Harmon. Swell.<br> - Blinky, you know the Swede.<br> - Oh.<br> - Miss Harmon, Blinky Franklin.<br> - How do you do?<br> At the piano, Lou Tingle,<br> and our hostess, Miss Collins.<br> Kitty, Mr. Anderson and Miss Harmon.<br> Hello.<br> - What are you drinking, Miss Harmon?<br> - Ginger ale, please. Plain.<br> - Swede?<br> - Rye and water.<br> - Ah, Blinky.<br> - Yeah?<br> Rye and water and ginger ale plain.<br> Make yourself at home, folks.<br> - Jake tells me you're a fighter.<br> - Do you like the fights?<br> I'm afraid I've never seen one.<br> - No kiddin'!<br> - I hate brutality, Mr. Anderson.<br> The idea of two men beating each<br> other to a pulp makes me ill.<br> I saw all Swede's fights.<br> How wonderful of you.<br> I could never bear to see a man<br> I really care for being hurt.<br> Kitty.<br> Oh, excuse me.<br> - She's beautiful.<br> - Yes.<br> Plain ginger ale for you, lady.<br> I've changed my mind.<br> You can sweeten it now.<br> No trouble whatsoever.<br> It's a nice apartment.<br> Must cost a fortune to keep it up.<br> I'll bet they need two servants<br> at least to take care of it.<br> The more I know of love<br> The less I know it<br> Here's your drink, lady.<br> - The more I give to love<br> - I said, here's your drink, lady.<br> - The more I owe it<br> - Oh, thank you very much.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Me?<br> - Nice apartment.<br> - Big Jim likes to live well.<br> - Big Jim?<br> - Yeah. Colfax.<br> - He's not here tonight?<br> - Tonight? No, ma'am.<br> Nor last night nor tomorrow night.<br> Not for a lot of nights.<br> Big Jim has his time all booked up.<br> Jim's out of town, Miss Harmon.<br> A heartbreak or two<br> The more I know of love<br> And you<br> Right then I knew<br> the boat had sailed.<br> I just got my things<br> and went on home.<br> I don't think Ole even missed me.<br> He'd never been in love before.<br> Poor Ole. When he did fall,<br> it had to be for dynamite.<br> - Who's Big Jim?<br> - Colfax? A thief with a touch of class.<br> Was in jail at the time.<br> Went straight after he came out.<br> That was seven, eight years ago.<br> - And the Swede went crooked?<br> - I know what you're thinking, Mr. Riordan.<br> I seem like a good deal<br> of a heel, don't I?<br> First, I marry Ole's girl. Then I<br> send him up for three years.<br> Oh, now don't talk nonsense, Sam. I wasn't<br> Ole's girl, not when I married you.<br> And you didn't set out to arrest him.<br> That's right.<br> Lil and I had been married<br> about a month then.<br> And one night, I went<br> into Lou Tingle's cafe.<br> I'd been given a tip<br> on some hot jewelry.<br> - Hello, Sam.<br> - Hiya, Charlie.<br> Miss Bryson, Lieutenant Lubinsky.<br> - How're tricks, Sam?<br> - It's been a long time.<br> - You're partly to blame for that.<br> - Only 90 days' worth.<br> No hard feelings.<br> Who's the girl sittin'<br> next to Jake the Rake?<br> Name of Collins.<br> - She got any other names?<br> - None that I know of.<br> She couldn't be Kitty<br> Collins, could she?<br> Waiter!<br> Yes, sir?<br> - More coffee.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> She's Big Jim Colfax's girl,<br> isn't she? Or used to be.<br> Ole Andreson's girl now,<br> or so I hear.<br> Good night, Ginny.<br> Don't you know what happens to<br> little boys who play with matches?<br> Just a minute.<br> - Pretty, isn't it?<br> - I never saw it before in my life.<br> I don't know anything about it.<br> - I swear, Lieutenant.<br> - Get your street clothes on.<br> This belong to you?<br> That? Me? No.<br> - Maybe you know who the owner is.<br> - I haven't any idea.<br> Not you, Jake?<br> How about the rest of you?<br> Well, since it was Kitty here had it on,<br> I guess she'll have to be the one I take in.<br> - Let's go, Kitty.<br> - Hi, Swede.<br> Hello, Barbara.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Hello, everybody.<br> Kitty, Jake. All set to go?<br> I finally got some front row...<br> Sam! Well, I'll be! How are you, boy?<br> Okay, Ole. Okay.<br> You seem to be doing all right.<br> That numbers racket really pays off.<br> Boy, you know everything.<br> This is one smart copper.<br> You know how long him and me knows<br> each other? Since we were little kids.<br> How about a fast drink?<br> What's the matter?<br> Kitty, what is it?<br> I'm runnin' her in, Swede.<br> - You mean a pinch?<br> - That's what I mean.<br> But you can't do this, Sam.<br> You're not going to try and<br> stop me, are you, Ole?<br> Don't you worry, honey.<br> Nothing's gonna happen to you.<br> - Sam, let's go sit down and talk...<br> - Some other time, Ole.<br> But be reasonable, Sam. You don't<br> understand. Kitty here and me are...<br> I know. I know. But I'm<br> only interested in this.<br> Sorry your girl had to be wearin'<br> it, but that's how it goes.<br> - If your girl happens to be a shoplifter...<br> - It's not true, Swede.<br> I didn't take it. I had<br> no idea it was stolen.<br> Swede, make him listen. I'll give it back.<br> I'll do anything if he'll just let me go.<br> Please, don't let him take me in,<br> Swede, or they'll throw the book at me.<br> Sam.<br> I'm asking you for old time's sake.<br> - There's nothing I can do, Ole. Come on.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> You don't want her, Sam.<br> I swiped that stuff myself.<br> I was lettin' her wear<br> it just for tonight.<br> I'm the one you're after. Get me?<br> Try and get me.<br> Of course, we did get<br> him the next day.<br> He was trying to catch<br> a bus to New York.<br> I pleaded with him to tell the<br> truth, but he stuck to his story.<br> It got him three years.<br> I went down to the train<br> when they took him away,<br> and that was the last<br> I ever saw of him.<br> You'd have never known that right<br> of his was broken, the way it felt.<br> - What became of Kitty?<br> - Oh, she went her own sweet way.<br> Haven't heard of her in years.<br> - Oh, Lilly.<br> - Yes, dear.<br> You better get ready.<br> We're burying Ole this<br> afternoon, Mr. Riordan.<br> Us and Packy Robinson.<br> When I read in the papers about him being<br> dead, I sent to Brentwood for his body.<br> I figured we owed him<br> a decent send-off.<br> All that the Father giveth<br> me shall come to me,<br> and him that cometh to me<br> I will in no wise cast out.<br> He that raised up Jesus from<br> the dead will also quicken...<br> our mortal bodies by his<br> spirit that dwelleth in us.<br> Riordan, if you ever<br> find out who killed Ole,<br> let me in on it.<br> Who's the man with the derby?<br> Packy was his manager.<br> - And the guy with him?<br> - Joe Smalley, his trainer.<br> At thy right hand, there<br> is pleasure forevermore.<br> Who's the other fellow over there?<br> Oh, an old-time hoodlum<br> named Charleston.<br> And we commit his body to the ground.<br> Earth to earth,<br> ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<br> Charleston don't talk, see.<br> Even if he's worked over<br> head to foot by experts.<br> - Charleston never talks.<br> - Good enough.<br> You know what happened to the Swede?<br> I know plenty, mister.<br> Plenty. Only I ain't tellin'.<br> Old Charleston's the little monkey<br> with his hands over his mouth.<br> How well did you know the Swede?<br> Me?<br> Mister,<br> I guess me and the Swede were<br> about as close as two guys can get.<br> For nearly two years,<br> we weren't never more than<br> eight and a half feet apart.<br> That's how big the cell was.<br> - There's Jupiter.<br> - Mmm.<br> Jupiter's a planet.<br> Do you know how many planets<br> there are circlin' the sun?<br> - How many?<br> - Nine.<br> Jupiter's to the earth like a...<br> like a football is to a marble.<br> That big.<br> Then on the other hand,<br> Mars ain't no bigger than a bean.<br> That small.<br> How come you know so<br> much about the stars?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Exceptin' after lights out,<br> nights I couldn't sleep...<br> I used to look at 'em<br> through the bars.<br> I knew they had names, and pretty soon<br> I got to wonderin' which was which.<br> So I got me a book from<br> the prison library...<br> and began to study up on 'em.<br> I don't guess there's a better<br> place in the whole world...<br> for learning about stars than stir.<br> That up there's the<br> constellation of Orion.<br> - Where?<br> - There.<br> Otherwise known as the "Big Bear."<br> You see that bright star in the center?<br> That's Betelgeuse, the "Red Giant."<br> The brightest star<br> in all the heavens.<br> Only it's so far away<br> it don't seem like it.<br> Charleston.<br> Yeah?<br> - You know what harps mean?<br> - Angels play 'em.<br> They mean Ireland.<br> That's why they call<br> them Mick's Harps.<br> Kitty's Irish.<br> She gave me this.<br> - A couple of more weeks, you'll be out.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I want you to do something for me.<br> - You name it.<br> It's been a long time<br> since I heard from Kitty.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Look her up. See if<br> she's okay, will you?<br> - Sure thing.<br> - Maybe she's sick or somethin'.<br> I'm worried.<br> Swede, I studied up on girls<br> times I wasn't in stir.<br> And you know what?<br> A girl don't write,<br> that don't mean she's sick<br> like you might think.<br> Not necessarily.<br> Yes, sir,<br> I guess you'd say I knew<br> the Swede real well.<br> Did you find out about his girl?<br> No, sir, I didn't.<br> I didn't find out a thing.<br> And do you know why?<br> Because she didn't<br> live there anymore.<br> But you saw the Swede again?<br> Sure, after he got out.<br> When was the last time you saw him?<br> - Mister, did you say when?<br> - Yes.<br> Mister, when it comes to dates,<br> I can tell you what<br> was the last time,<br> but not where nor when<br> or who was present.<br> All right. What was the last time?<br> That's better. Much better.<br> Word was passed along to me...<br> that a certain party<br> wanted to see me.<br> I was to be at a certain place...<br> at a certain time and<br> bring the Swede.<br> He'd just got out a<br> couple days before.<br> Sit down!<br> Never knew a guy who was in<br> stir more than ten years...<br> didn't walk up and down all the time.<br> Oh, it ain't that. It's just<br> I get nervous sittin' still.<br> Well, we get nervous, you walking<br> up and down all the time.<br> - What are we waitin' for anyway?<br> - Want to play some blackjack?<br> Not with you I don't.<br> I know your reputation.<br> - What about my reputation?<br> - Nothin' about it.<br> I just don't want to play<br> blackjack with you, that's all.<br> Cut for deal.<br> Anyhow, I didn't come<br> up here to play cards.<br> You were going to tell us<br> about a caper. Go ahead.<br> - We're waiting for the Swede to show.<br> - Well, I'm tired of waiting.<br> You can leave anytime<br> you want, friend.<br> Come on, easy does it, fellas.<br> Easy does it.<br> I don't like to be asked to come<br> up here and then told I can go.<br> Who do you think<br> you're pushin' around?<br> A minute ago we were<br> talking about reputations.<br> Well, you've got quite<br> a reputation yourself.<br> You're supposed to be a troublemaker.<br> Okay, make some.<br> - Who's there?<br> - It's me. Anderson.<br> - Hello, Swede.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Glad to see you, Swede.<br> - Hello.<br> - How are you, Charleston?<br> - Hello, Swede.<br> Hello.<br> I take it you know everybody.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Grab yourself a chair.<br> Now that the Swede's here,<br> maybe we can get started.<br> - Yeah, what's the pitch?<br> - It's big.<br> The biggest caper that's been<br> pulled around here in years.<br> It should be good for<br> better than 250 grand.<br> - Bank job?<br> - Uh-uh. Payroll.<br> Where?<br> I'll tell you that when you<br> decide whether you're in or not.<br> How am I to decide if I don't<br> know what the layout is?<br> That's your problem,<br> but I'll tell you this:<br> The job's been cased<br> backwards and forwards.<br> The getaway's been fixed and we've<br> got ten days to plan every last move.<br> - Would just us be in on it?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> What'll the split be?<br> I take the first hundred grand.<br> The rest you divide to suit yourselves.<br> Who declared you<br> in for the big slice?<br> I declared myself.<br> If you don't like the setup,<br> declare yourself out.<br> And no hard feelings.<br> What about her?<br> She's with me.<br> - It's a four-way split then without you.<br> - What about it?<br> I'm in, provided the rest of<br> us share and share alike.<br> - No more long splits.<br> - Okay by me. You?<br> You twitch a lot, friend.<br> Nervous, huh?<br> Carrying the monkey on<br> your back, ain't you?<br> - I was. I'm not anymore.<br> - Is that straight?<br> He wouldn't be here if it wasn't.<br> Okay, I'm in.<br> Charleston?<br> - Count me out.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Oh, I don't know...<br> Something about the<br> setup you don't like?<br> - Maybe it's too big.<br> - I don't get you.<br> If it's as big as you claim,<br> it's not going to be any easy pickin's.<br> Nothing that big ever is.<br> And that's what I want from<br> here on in. Easy pickin's.<br> It'd go just as hard with you if you were<br> taken for stickin' up a shine parlor.<br> Yes, that's right, but the chances<br> of being taken aren't as many.<br> I don't know. Maybe...<br> Maybe I'm just gettin' old.<br> It's like you were saying<br> before the Swede come in.<br> I've done a lot of time.<br> I've spent almost<br> half my life in stir,<br> and I don't intend to spend any more.<br> Okay, Charleston. So long.<br> So long.<br> - No offense.<br> - No offense.<br> What about you, Swede?<br> I'm in.<br> - Right.<br> - So long, Swede.<br> Be seeing you, Charleston.<br> - Do you want a word of advice?<br> - Huh?<br> Stop listening to those<br> golden harps, Swede.<br> They can land you<br> into a lot of trouble.<br> What are you drivin' at?<br> I left him, and I<br> waited out in the hall.<br> I had hoped he'd walk out too,<br> but he never showed up.<br> And I never seen the Swede again.<br> I was sorry...<br> 'cause him and me...<br> We had some good talks<br> about the stars.<br> - Good morning, Stella.<br> - Good morning, dream boy.<br> I got that dope on<br> Charleston for you.<br> Working in a Philadelphia pool hall.<br> - What am I doing here?<br> - Don't change the subject.<br> See if you can get anything<br> on a girl named Kitty Collins.<br> - Well, the bell rang.<br> - What bell?<br> The green handkerchief. I just came<br> from the library. Take a look at this.<br> "Bandits rob hat factory<br> of quarter-million payroll.<br> Prentiss Hat Company in Hackensack<br> victim of daring holdup."<br> - What's the connection?<br> - Well, read it.<br> "The Prentiss Hat Company<br> in Hackensack, New Jersey,<br> "was the victim yesterday<br> of a sensational robbery.<br> "Each step of the holdup had<br> obviously been carefully planned,<br> "and police officials are certain<br> the job was masterminded...<br> "by someone with firsthand knowledge<br> of the hat company's operations.<br> "Shortly before 8:00, four men,<br> "all wearing employee<br> identification badges,<br> "joined the incoming day shift<br> at the Prentiss factory.<br> "There was nothing unusual<br> about the interlopers...<br> "as they lined up with<br> the other employees,<br> "and the gatekeeper had<br> no reason for suspicion...<br> "as the four robbers<br> sauntered through the gate,<br> "ostensibly on their way to work.<br> "At the Prentiss factory,<br> the paymaster's office...<br> "is just across the yard<br> from the employees' gate.<br> "Apparently, the strangers<br> merely crossed the yard,<br> "loitered near the stairway that<br> leads to the cashier's office,<br> "and then entered the building,<br> taking their own sweet time in the move.<br> "A few seconds later, while the<br> paymaster and his assistants...<br> "were working on routine tasks in<br> connection with company business,<br> "the holdup men suddenly appeared.<br> "At the point of drawn guns,<br> "they performed the robbery<br> with detailed precision.<br> "Two of the bandits<br> proceeded to rifle...<br> "the company's safe<br> and paymaster's till...<br> "while the others bound and<br> gagged the Prentiss employees.<br> "They then left hastily,<br> "using the same door through which<br> they had previously entered.<br> "They took with them the company's<br> entire semi-monthly payroll...<br> "amounting to $254,912.<br> "Entering the yard again,<br> the bandits fell in behind a truck...<br> "that was just leaving the factory.<br> "With the gates open to permit<br> the truck to exit into the street,<br> "the holdup men dashed<br> into the clear...<br> "and made their way to three cars that<br> had been planted earlier for the escape.<br> "The gatekeeper, Henry Wilson,<br> of411 Spring Street,<br> "ran into the street,<br> firing a warning shot...<br> "and shouting for them to stop.<br> "When they ignored his command,<br> Wilson fired first at one car,<br> "and then at another that was<br> having trouble in the getaway.<br> "This latter car returned the<br> fire as it sped past Wilson,<br> "and the gatekeeper fell to the<br> ground with a bullet in his groin.<br> "He is now in the<br> Hackensack hospital,<br> "where doctors say he<br> will probably recover.<br> "The four bandits all had their faces<br> covered during the actual robbery,<br> "so no detailed<br> description is available.<br> "One of them, however, is described<br> by the paymaster as wearing...<br> "an unusual green handkerchief decorated<br> with golden harps over his face.<br> State and local police<br> are investigating."<br> "Unusual green handkerchief."<br> They sell those by the thousand<br> every St. Patrick's Day.<br> But this is the one that<br> was used in that holdup.<br> - How do you know that?<br> - Follow me.<br> Take an ex-pug named the Swede,<br> falls for a girl named Kitty Collins.<br> He takes a three-year rap for her.<br> When he gets out, he's brought<br> into a robbery setup...<br> through an old-time<br> thief named Charleston.<br> There's a girl present the<br> night of the big powwow.<br> Charleston wouldn't name names,<br> but my guess is that same Kitty Collins.<br> Go on.<br> The Prentiss Hat robbery<br> was July 20, 1940.<br> That same night, the Swede<br> and an unidentified woman...<br> check into a small<br> hotel in Atlantic City.<br> Two days later the<br> woman takes a powder,<br> and the Swede tries<br> to pile out a window.<br> A chambermaid saves his life,<br> and he's grateful enough<br> to leave her his insurance.<br> - Is that all?<br> - Just about.<br> Until six years later,<br> we find the Swede in Brentwood.<br> As far as anyone knows,<br> a filling-station attendant.<br> Except...<br> he's waiting for some killers<br> to come and get him.<br> Huh. Nice of him to hang on<br> to this, wasn't it? Without it,<br> I'd have gone on about my business and<br> the whole thing would have blown over.<br> - Forget it.<br> - What?<br> It's not worth your time.<br> But we insured Prentiss Hat. There's<br> a quarter of a million dollars...<br> of Atlantic Casualty money<br> that's never been recovered.<br> Riordan, you know the<br> insurance business.<br> The losses in any one year determine<br> the premium to be paid the following.<br> We pay out in 1940,<br> as we did with Prentiss Hat.<br> That's adjusted in our rates<br> for 1941. This is 1946.<br> Our job is to keep our<br> losses at a minimum...<br> so that the rates don't have to go up<br> in 1947. That's how we serve the public.<br> And you're not interested<br> in recovering this money?<br> Oh, sure I am, if you knew just where<br> to lay your hands on it, but you don't.<br> You have a hunch about one man<br> who may have been in the holdup.<br> He's dead. Aside from that,<br> you know nothing.<br> I didn't know that two days ago.<br> Kenyon speaking.<br> For you.<br> Riordan. Hello, Lubinsky.<br> How are you?<br> What? The devil you say.<br> Hold the wire a minute.<br> Am I still on this case or<br> have I quit Atlantic Casualty?<br> - Well, I...<br> - Which is it?<br> All right. I'll give you a week.<br> But if you don't turn up the dough,<br> the time comes off your vacation.<br> Okay, Lubinsky, I'll be<br> with you in an hour.<br> Two sailors found him lying in a<br> depot washroom in a pool of blood.<br> The shootin' couldn't have happened<br> more than a minute or two earlier.<br> - Who is he?<br> - Ever hear of Blinky Franklin?<br> That's who he is. Keeps ravin' on and<br> on about the Swede, Dum-dum Clark...<br> and our old friend Kitty Collins.<br> No use my telling you, though.<br> You can get it straight<br> from the horse's mouth.<br> - What are his chances?<br> - Nil.<br> - How long has he got?<br> - He's behind schedule now.<br> That's why I told you to hurry.<br> Hello, Doctor.<br> If that guy don't call by 10:30,<br> we better get started anyway.<br> Each one steal his own heap.<br> Still raining. It would be.<br> Bet ten. I'll stay.<br> I never was in a hat factory before.<br> You ain't in this one yet.<br> He's talking about the night<br> before the Prentiss Hat robbery.<br> Give me two cards. I'll take three.<br> If this rain keeps up, it'll be mud<br> up to the axles on them hick roads.<br> How many miles of dirt road<br> is it to the Halfway House?<br> I don't like anything<br> about capers in the rain.<br> Rain always gives me the creeps.<br> I hate rain. I hate rain.<br> One for the dealer.<br> Eleven miles to the Halfway House,<br> Blinky, your's and Dum-dum's route.<br> - I can't win a pot.<br> - Me either.<br> How about it, boys? Got all the<br> moves straight in your minds now?<br> We ought to. We've been<br> over it often enough.<br> - Why don't that guy call?<br> - Relax, Dum-dum.<br> Waitin' on word about<br> cars reminds me that...<br> a couple of birds I used to know<br> once stuck up a theater in L.A.<br> Everything goes swell...<br> until they go to get in their heap.<br> You know what? Somebody stolen it.<br> A traffic cop shoots<br> one of the birds dead...<br> up an alley in back of the theater.<br> The other bird surrenders<br> with all the money.<br> Some story. Know any more like it?<br> Yeah. There's another<br> bird I used to know...<br> Well, don't tell it! We don't want<br> to listen to your stories, see?<br> Go ahead, deal the cards.<br> I fell asleep.<br> - Let me cut before you deal, will ya?<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - What do you mean, what's the matter?<br> - You're nervous. You're all in a sweat.<br> You keep your mouth shut if<br> you don't want it slapped shut.<br> - You been askin' for it lately.<br> - Hey!<br> - Any objections?<br> - Yeah!<br> Keep out of this, Swede.<br> She's his girl.<br> Mind your own business, Swede.<br> I can take care of myself.<br> You touch me and you<br> won't live till morning.<br> Come on, Swede, play a few hands.<br> Move over.<br> - Deal 'em.<br> - Deal me out.<br> - Three cards.<br> - Same.<br> One for the dealer. $ 150.<br> I fold.<br> Up you $100.<br> - Up you $200.<br> - Up you $200.<br> - I'll look.<br> - Two pair. Aces and sevens.<br> Tough. Full house.<br> Eights over deuces.<br> Reach for that and I'll<br> kick your brains out.<br> What did he hit him for?<br> I don't get it.<br> Nobody can cheat me<br> and get away with it.<br> Didn't you think he had 'em?<br> He oughta showed me his cards<br> before reaching for the pot.<br> If it wasn't for tomorrow,<br> I'd be for giving you the works.<br> - He should've turned his cards over.<br> - Yeah.<br> The job comes first,<br> but afterwards,<br> we'll have business together.<br> Anytime you say.<br> Hello. Yeah.<br> Yeah, this is him.<br> Uh-huh. What are they?<br> Uh-huh. Okay.<br> The cars are waiting at the garages.<br> Everything is okay.<br> - We may as well get goin' then.<br> - See you in the morning.<br> Yeah. You too, Swede.<br> He shouldn't have hit you.<br> You had 'em just like you said.<br> He shouldn't have hit you.<br> He shouldn't have hit you.<br> Beats me. I don't know<br> what keeps him going.<br> Will he be able to talk anymore?<br> He's dead now, except he's breathing.<br> Well, guess I'll have to hunt up<br> my old friend, Kitty Collins.<br> We've got nothing on her.<br> This isn't evidence.<br> Don't I know it?<br> Swell chance of ever getting...<br> the ravings of a delirious<br> man admitted as testimony.<br> Here's something, Lieutenant.<br> Hmm. A newspaper story<br> of the Swede's murder...<br> - and a bus ticket to Brentwood.<br> - They were in his pants pocket.<br> Step on it. Can't you get any<br> more out of it than this?<br> Looks like a good clean getaway.<br> It's too bad you had to<br> shoot that guy at the gate.<br> The robbery's over.<br> This is the getaway.<br> Did it look like 200 G's to you?<br> Most money I ever saw all at once.<br> Wonder if the others are playing<br> on the same luck we are.<br> They should be.<br> They got away before we did.<br> I guess the Swede made it all right.<br> I seen him runnin' for his heap and<br> nobody was between him and it.<br> Sure, he got away.<br> Keep your eyes peeled for Polk Road.<br> It's a left turn there. Yeah.<br> A left on Polk Road.<br> We oughta be there in<br> another five minutes.<br> Hello, farmer.<br> - Others here yet?<br> - I'm in here.<br> Hey!<br> - Everything go okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> Definitely.<br> Oh, boy.<br> And they aren't marked, either.<br> No use standin' around lookin'<br> at it. Let's start countin'.<br> Stand back, you.<br> All right, heist 'em!<br> Turn around. You, drop that gun.<br> Up against the wall.<br> Put your hands up. Higher!<br> Swell idea you guys had.<br> Leavin' me holdin' the bag at the Halfway<br> House while you split up the dough, huh?<br> I'll betcha it handed you a laugh.<br> The Halfway House burnt down<br> last night. That's why we came here.<br> - Somebody oughta have let me know.<br> - You were told. You're here.<br> Next time, play it straight.<br> I'll be seein' ya, Swede.<br> There goes a quarter of a million dollars!<br> A quarter of a million.<br> A quarter of a million.<br> It took him six years to find out<br> where the Swede was hiding.<br> - And then it was too late.<br> - Yeah.<br> I wonder what he and the Swede'll<br> have to say to each other now.<br> At least we know why Blinky<br> was on his way to Brentwood.<br> A quarter of a million<br> makes pretty good bait.<br> I wonder which other one of the gang<br> knocked him off to beat him to the punch.<br> Hmm. The Swede's room in<br> Brentwood should answer that.<br> Officer.<br> What is it?<br> - Got any rooms?<br> - Just one.<br> - Can I see it?<br> - This way. Upstairs.<br> Just got in town.<br> Fella runs the lunchroom down the<br> street said you had a roomer here.<br> Name of Lunn, somethin' like that.<br> Said he died. Thought the<br> room might still be empty.<br> It still is empty. This is it.<br> It'll do.<br> - Nine dollars a week, in advance.<br> - Okay.<br> The bathroom's down the hall,<br> the last room on the right.<br> Here's your money. I'll let<br> you know if I want anything.<br> All right.<br> Is that the man?<br> I'll go call the police.<br> Find anything?<br> Better put your hands up.<br> - What are you after?<br> - Same thing you are.<br> The money from the<br> Prentiss Hat caper.<br> - Where do you come in?<br> - I know about it. That's enough.<br> - How do you know about it?<br> - Blinky Franklin told me.<br> - Blinky's dead.<br> - I know. Sit over there.<br> - Is this a pinch?<br> - I'm not a cop.<br> Then what do you want from me?<br> You don't know what the<br> Swede did with the money...<br> or you wouldn't be here<br> tearing his room to pieces.<br> But maybe you do know things that,<br> put together with the things I know,<br> will tell me where the money is.<br> And the way things stand, I think<br> you'd better answer my questions.<br> What do you wanna know?<br> Why did you meet at the<br> farmer's after the robbery...<br> instead of the Halfway<br> House as you'd planned?<br> Well?<br> That caper was a long time ago.<br> Come on, Dum-dum. You remember.<br> Halfway House burned down<br> the night before the caper.<br> Uh-huh. And who picked the farmer's?<br> Mister, you wanna know too much.<br> Dum-dum,<br> Blinky was killed with your special<br> kind of a bullet out of a.45.<br> - A gun just like this.<br> - You makin' a deal?<br> I can't see you've anything<br> to lose either way.<br> Who picked the farmer's?<br> - Who do you think?<br> - I'm asking, you're answering.<br> Colfax.<br> That wouldn't be Big Jim, would it?<br> When did you get the news of the<br> Halfway House burning down?<br> We'd all split up by then.<br> We weren't gonna meet until<br> next mornin' at the factory.<br> Colfax knew where we all were.<br> He sent us word about the change.<br> Who by? Kitty?<br> What time?<br> She got to my hideout<br> around midnight.<br> At the farmer's when the<br> Swede stuck you guys up,<br> he claimed he hadn't been<br> told about the switch.<br> How else would he have known<br> to come to the farmer's?<br> Did you kill the Swede?<br> Not me. I never could find him.<br> I didn't know where he was at until I<br> read in the papers about his gettin' it.<br> - Who did kill him?<br> - You got me.<br> It wasn't Blinky and me.<br> We were after the money.<br> Would we knock off the one guy<br> could tell us where it was?<br> And you killed Blinky so he<br> couldn't get here ahead of you.<br> Aw, I'd have split with him.<br> I didn't want him to come here.<br> He might of got picked up.<br> Those kind of guys'll blab<br> anything if you work on 'em right.<br> Uh, okay if I smoke?<br> Yeah.<br> By the way, what's<br> become of Kitty Collins?<br> Kitty?<br> Let me see now.<br> Last I heard of Kitty...<br> Okay, mister. Now it's your<br> turn to answer the questions.<br> Why'd you wanna know about Kitty?<br> Come on! Now I'm askin',<br> you're answering.<br> I think she knows where the money is.<br> - How do you figure?<br> - The Swede and some girl...<br> checked into an Atlantic City<br> hotel the night of the holdup.<br> Two days later,<br> the girl took a powder.<br> I've got an idea the<br> dough went with her.<br> What makes you think it was Kitty?<br> She was Colfax's girl.<br> I'm not arguing with you.<br> Yeah, yeah. I got it.<br> You're makin' a sucker play, Dum-dum.<br> The cops are outside waitin' for you.<br> I'll take care of the cops.<br> So long, mister.<br> There's a man on the roof!<br> - Hello, Lieutenant. Glad to see you.<br> - Hello.<br> - What gives?<br> - I think we're on the home stretch.<br> - Where are we goin'?<br> - Pittsburgh.<br> He doesn't know it yet, but I've got a<br> date with your old friend, Big Jim Colfax.<br> - Remember? Kitty's ex-boyfriend?<br> - Yeah. How does he figure?<br> As the number-one man. He planned<br> the whole Prentiss Hat job.<br> - Where'd you get that?<br> - Dum-dum.<br> - He showed, did he, at Brentwood?<br> - Yeah.<br> - He also got away after a gun battle.<br> - 'Board!<br> They found blood on the<br> roof where he'd been hit.<br> Every cop in Brentwood is<br> claiming credit for the shot.<br> - What were you doing at the time?<br> - I was up in the Swede's room,<br> - sleeping it off.<br> - Big Jim, huh?<br> He was supposed to have gone legit.<br> - He has. Big contractor now.<br> - Mr. Riordan?<br> - Here I am. That's me.<br> - James Riordan?<br> - Telegram, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> "Answering your query,<br> Halfway House fire...<br> "July 20, 1940, at 2:53 a.m.<br> Signed, Kenny, Chief, Hackensack<br> Fire Department." What's it mean?<br> Means we're headed<br> in the right direction.<br> Oh, by the way, did you<br> bring along that extra.45?<br> Yeah. What happened to yours?<br> - Oh, it got lost or stolen or...<br> - Or something.<br> Mmm. Let's get some shut-eye.<br> - Mr. Colfax?<br> - Yeah.<br> Not interested in<br> insurance, Mr. Riordan.<br> I'm not a salesman.<br> I'm investigating the death<br> of a man named Ole Anderson.<br> Alias Pete Lunn,<br> but best known as the Swede.<br> I don't remember any of those names.<br> - Work for me?<br> - You could call it that.<br> - How long ago?<br> - 1940.<br> Oh. Hunting season starts pretty soon.<br> I never miss the first day.<br> I learned that Anderson<br> was a member of a gang...<br> that once robbed the Prentiss Hat<br> Factory of about a quarter of a million.<br> Oh, yeah. I remember<br> reading about that.<br> They all got away, didn't they?<br> The law never caught up with any of them.<br> Not so far. But most of them<br> turned out to be unhealthy.<br> The farmer died from natural causes.<br> The Swede and Blinky<br> Franklin were both killed.<br> Dum-dum went back to Brentwood and<br> got shot in a fight with the police.<br> Do you know who else was in the gang?<br> You were.<br> Me?<br> No, brother,<br> you're on the wrong track.<br> I'm an honest citizen.<br> - Seems to have paid off pretty well.<br> - I've got no complaints.<br> People around here...<br> the businessmen and all...<br> they know I served time,<br> but they don't hold it against me.<br> They figure if a guy's trying to level,<br> he deserves a helping hand.<br> Nice speech, Colfax. Solid.<br> Look, Riordan, if you're trying to<br> pin anything on me, go right ahead.<br> - I got nothing to hide.<br> - That's your opinion.<br> Anyhow, I haven't got one shred<br> of evidence against you.<br> Nothin' but hearsay.<br> Frankly, it's not you<br> I'm interested in.<br> I want to find out what's become<br> of a girl named Kitty Collins.<br> - You remember Kitty?<br> - Yeah, I remember Kitty.<br> Maybe I'm not telling you anything, but<br> it was Kitty Collins and not the Swede...<br> - that reaped the golden harvest.<br> - How do you mean?<br> When the gang met to divvy<br> up after the robbery,<br> the Swede pulled a fast one and<br> walked off with the whole take.<br> No wonder he got blasted.<br> That same night, he and Kitty<br> were together in Atlantic City.<br> She walked out on him<br> a couple of days later.<br> The money disappeared when she did.<br> Is that on the level, Riordan?<br> A chambermaid at the<br> hotel can identify Kitty...<br> if I can produce her.<br> Any idea where she's at?<br> I thought you might<br> be able to tell me.<br> Right now, I wish I knew.<br> I'll tell you something, Riordan.<br> If there's one thing in this world I<br> hate, it's a double-crossing dame.<br> That guy... What's his name?<br> The Swede?<br> Never had a chance, did he?<br> Any one of the gang that ran on to him<br> would have been sure to knock him off.<br> You might say Kitty Collins<br> signed his death warrant.<br> Hello? Yeah, speaking.<br> Yeah. Mmm-hmm.<br> Yeah, he's here with me right now.<br> Okay.<br> A fellow named Jake the Rake.<br> - Asking about Kitty?<br> - Yeah.<br> I sent out word that she had till 10:00<br> tonight to get in touch with me...<br> or I'd take what I<br> know to the police.<br> So long, Colfax.<br> Glad to have met you.<br> Say, Riordan. If ya do run on<br> to her, let me know, will ya?<br> After you're through with her,<br> I'd like to have a word<br> or two with Kitty myself.<br> We got some unfinished business.<br> I wonder if that chambermaid<br> can really identify Kitty.<br> After six years? Not a chance.<br> But Colfax fell for it.<br> I think Kitty will too.<br> You know what I think? I think we're<br> nuts waitin' here for that dame to call.<br> She'll call.<br> A deuce'll get you four she won't.<br> I haven't been on the force<br> all these years for nothin'.<br> I know more about women...<br> Yes? Riordan speaking.<br> Wherever you say, Miss Collins.<br> The Green Cat on Salton Street?<br> No. No, thanks.<br> I don't like the Green Cat.<br> Better make it the lobby of the<br> Adelphi Theater in 20 minutes.<br> No, I won't be there,<br> but I'll send a man.<br> The show's already begun, so there won't<br> be any crowd. He'll bring you to me.<br> Look, there'll be no police.<br> I wanna make a deal.<br> If you're pinched, that ends that.<br> Figure it out for yourself.<br> Good. The man'll be waiting.<br> Blue suit, bow tie.<br> Got a match?<br> Never mind. I only wanted<br> to see your tie. I'm ready.<br> We'll take a cab.<br> Straight ahead.<br> I'll tell you when to turn.<br> - Where's Riordan?<br> - I'm Riordan.<br> I should have known.<br> I was hoping you'd call.<br> How'd you know where to find me?<br> A voice from the past,<br> Jake the Rake, called me.<br> I took the first plane<br> for Pittsburgh.<br> Right at the next corner.<br> Where are we going?<br> The Green Cat on Salton Street.<br> Thought you didn't<br> like the Green Cat.<br> Only when I'm not expected.<br> Glass of milk, hot.<br> I haven't eaten all day.<br> Steak sandwich, rare,<br> and a glass of beer.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Well, how about it?<br> - How about what, Mr. Riordan?<br> - The $254,912.<br> - You think I have it?<br> - For your sake, I hope so.<br> I'm not the law.<br> My job is to recover money that<br> the company I work for is out.<br> If the money's gone, well,<br> putting you awayfor20years...<br> would be something to show<br> for my time and effort.<br> Can you put me away, Mr. Riordan?<br> Blinky Franklin made a<br> deathbed statement under oath.<br> There's no stronger testimony.<br> And there's a chambermaid<br> in an Atlantic City hotel...<br> that has a memory for faces.<br> Well?<br> Oh, there's no use kidding myself.<br> I'd do anything you wanted.<br> Give you every penny I<br> could lay my hands on.<br> How many pennies is that?<br> Well, I... I might be able to raise<br> $65,000, $70,000 at the most.<br> - Not enough.<br> - That's all I could possibly get together.<br> I'm not stalling, Mr. Riordan,<br> not now. I know when I'm beaten.<br> I'm fighting for my life.<br> Not Kitty Collins' life, but mine.<br> I have a home now and a husband.<br> I've got a life worth fighting for<br> and there's nothing in this world...<br> I wouldn't do to keep<br> it just the way it is.<br> Well, we might still be<br> able to do business...<br> if you put a prize in<br> with the Cracker Jacks.<br> What do you mean?<br> I want a fall guy for the law.<br> Who would that be?<br> Colfax.<br> Even the old Kitty Collins<br> never sang, Mr. Riordan.<br> Well, I'll be moseying along.<br> Do I tell the police where you live<br> and what time you'll be home?<br> Oh, please wait. What is it you want?<br> That's better.<br> Who planned the robbery?<br> - Colfax.<br> - Was the Swede in love with you?<br> I hadn't seen him for a long time,<br> but the minute I laid eyes on him, I knew.<br> He was always looking at me,<br> and it doesn't sound like very much,<br> but he always carried a<br> handkerchief I'd given him.<br> Green... with golden harps?<br> - Steak sandwich?<br> - For me. The milk's for the lady.<br> Mr. Riordan, I'd like you<br> to believe something.<br> I hated my life, only I wasn't<br> strong enough to get away from it.<br> All I could do was dream of some big payoff<br> that would let me quit the whole racket.<br> The Swede was my chance to<br> make my dream come true.<br> If I could only be alone<br> with him for a few hours.<br> But Colfax was always there.<br> I thought it was hopeless,<br> and then suddenly my chance came.<br> You mean the burning down<br> of the Halfway House.<br> Colfax sent me to tell the<br> others what had happened,<br> and that they were to meet<br> at the farmer's instead.<br> I went to Blinky Franklin<br> first and then to Dum-dum.<br> I saved the Swede till last.<br> It was nearly2:00 in the<br> morning when I got there.<br> Kitty!<br> What's up?<br> I'm taking my life in my hands<br> coming to you like this.<br> But I just couldn't stand by, not after<br> what you did for me that time in Philly.<br> Forget that. Why are you here now?<br> Colfax thinks I'm on my way to New York.<br> He's meeting me there tomorrow.<br> But I just had to come to you,<br> Swede, and tell you.<br> Tell me what?<br> They're planning to double-cross you.<br> Who is?<br> Colfax and the others.<br> They don't intend for you ever to get a<br> smell of the money from tomorrow's job.<br> How do you know that?<br> Colfax sprung it tonight on Dum-dum<br> and Blinky right after you left.<br> First he called you names and<br> said dirty things about you,<br> and then he sprung it.<br> What if they were not to go to the<br> Halfway House after the robbery?<br> You'd go there,<br> but they'd be someplace else<br> and so would the money.<br> - What did Blinky and Dum-dum say?<br> - They fell right in with the idea.<br> Where are they gonna meet?<br> The farmhouse north of town on Polk<br> Road, eleven miles out on the turnpike.<br> Colfax hates you, Swede,<br> so much so that Blinky and<br> Dum-dum have caught it from him,<br> and they hate you too.<br> Thanks for putting me wise, Kitty.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> Swede, what are you gonna do?<br> I'm gonna do them like<br> they mean to do me.<br> Promise me one thing.<br> You won't give me away.<br> - If Colfax ever found out what I did...<br> - Don't you worry.<br> You know why Colfax hates you?<br> Because of me.<br> He's no fool.<br> He sees what's happened.<br> Why did you ever go<br> back to him, Kitty?<br> Maybe because I hate him.<br> I'm poison, Swede, to myself<br> and everybody around me.<br> I'd be afraid to go with anyone<br> I love for the harm I'd do them.<br> I don't care, harming him.<br> You're not meetin' him tomorrow.<br> Aren't I, Swede?<br> And that's it, Mr. Riordan.<br> The whole story.<br> I knew then that by night the<br> Swede'd have the money, all of it.<br> And it all worked out.<br> He met me right after he<br> left the farmer's place.<br> We drove down to Atlantic City.<br> And as soon as you could<br> break away, you left him flat.<br> I'd like to have known<br> the old Kitty Collins.<br> You were in the clear because no one<br> knew you'd been with the Swede.<br> You had nothing to fear from anyone.<br> Too bad it had to catch<br> up with you now.<br> Let's get out of here,<br> Mr. Riordan. I'm nervous.<br> - Where do you want to go?<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> Take me back to your hotel with you.<br> - I'll powder my nose.<br> - I'll wait for you.<br> Don't go away.<br> - How much further?<br> - About three miles.<br> Cut your siren. We'll drive right<br> up and hit the front door.<br> You boys cover the other<br> doors and windows.<br> Right.<br> - Got your gun handy?<br> - Sure. Why?<br> Just thought I'd ask.<br> It's Dum-dum.<br> Cover us! You get over there.<br> Operator, this is a police call.<br> Get an ambulance out to<br> - Ambulance won't do any good.<br> - Sorry, Colfax.<br> I'd hoped to beat out Dum-dum.<br> I wanted you alive.<br> - How'd you figure it, Riordan?<br> - Dum-dum tipped me.<br> He said Kitty brought him word at<br> midnight about the changed meeting place.<br> The Halfway House didn't burn down<br> till nearly 3:00 in the morning.<br> That meant Kitty had a partner.<br> And who could he be but you?<br> - Is this your woman?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hello, Kitty.<br> - We got her outside.<br> - How bad is he?<br> - The ambulance is on its way.<br> It's gonna be a little late.<br> I guess our luck's run out, Kitty.<br> You didn't have anything on<br> her before now, did you?<br> No, but I had to make you think so.<br> Then I was sure you'd try to knock me off<br> before I could find out Kitty was your wife.<br> You knew that too?<br> Married people can't testify<br> against each other.<br> Otherwise, I'd have tried playing<br> you off, one against the other,<br> instead of making myself a target<br> for those gunmen of yours.<br> Give me a cigarette, will you?<br> What I don't get is why you sent<br> those two killers to blast the Swede.<br> He wasn't doing you any<br> harm there in Brentwood.<br> Why didn't you let well enough alone?<br> I couldn't.<br> Suppose one of the gang<br> ran into him, same as I did.<br> They were after the money.<br> He'd have had a chance to tell his story<br> and that would have been the end of it.<br> They knew Kitty and I were married,<br> and they'd have seen<br> through the frame-up.<br> Anyhow, if I hadn't had him knocked<br> off, he'd have wondered why...<br> and begun thinking.<br> Jim! Jim!<br> Tell them I didn't know anything.<br> Jim, listen to me.<br> You can save me.<br> Jim, do you hear me? Tell them I<br> didn't know those gunmen were coming.<br> Say, "Kitty is innocent.<br> I swear, Kitty is innocent."<br> Say it, Jim, say it!<br> It'll save me if you do.<br> Don't ask a dying man<br> to lie his soul into hell.<br> "Kitty is innocent.<br> I swear, Kitty is innocent."<br> It's no use, Kitty.<br> Your would-be fall guy is dead.<br> Come back, Jim. Tell them. Come back!<br> Save me! Jim!<br> "Kitty is innocent.<br> I swear, Kitty is innocent."<br> "Kitty is innocent!<br> I swear, Kitty is innocent!"<br> "Kitty is innocent!"<br> And the Swede never knew his girl...<br> had gone straight back to<br> Colfax with all the money.<br> As for the others, they had no idea<br> she'd ever been away from Colfax.<br> - Have I got it all straight?<br> - Right.<br> Then Colfax framed the whole thing just<br> so he wouldn't have to split the take.<br> The double cross to end<br> all double crosses.<br> Yeah. And just to think, none of<br> this would have ever come to light...<br> if it hadn't been for a<br> $2,500 death benefit.<br> Uh-huh.<br> Well, I suppose you're<br> waiting to be congratulated.<br> Ah, it's the job.<br> Owing to your splendid efforts,<br> the basic rate of the Atlantic<br> Casualty Company as of 1947...<br> will probably drop<br> one-tenth of a cent.<br> Congratulations, Mr. Riordan.<br> I'd rather have a night's sleep.<br> Why don't you take a good rest?<br> I must say, you've earned it.<br> This is Friday.<br> Don't come in till Monday.<br> Thanks.<br>
