                        Cambodia.<br> To many Westerners,<br> it seemed a paradise.<br> Another world, a secret world.<br> But the war in neighboring<br> Vietnam burst its borders...<br> ...and the fighting soon spread<br> to neutral Cambodia.<br> In 1973, I went to cover<br> this sideshow struggle...<br> ...as foreign correspondent<br> of The New York Times.<br> It was there, amidst the fighting...<br> ...between government troops<br> and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...<br> ...that I met my guide<br> and interpreter, Dith Pran...<br> ...a man who was to change my life...<br> ...in a country that I grew to love<br> and pity.<br> So here we go<br> with Voice of America...<br> ...news for Southeast Asia.<br> It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy<br> morning here.<br> Clouds too in Washington.<br> President Nixon announced he'll<br> address the nation on Watergate...<br> ...within the next few days.<br> The speech will be Nixon's<br> first since May.<br> The scandal has caused resignations<br> and paralyzed the White House staff.<br> It has also led to intense<br> confrontation and perhaps...<br> ...a constitutional crisis<br> with Senate investigators...<br> ...and a special<br> Watergate prosecutor.<br> The speech was announced<br> after the Gallup Poll disclosed...<br> ...that Mr. Nixon's popularity<br> had fallen to the lowest point...<br> ...for an American President<br> in 20 years.<br> A Supreme Court judge,<br> William O. Douglas...<br> ...has ruled against an appeal<br> by the Administration...<br> ...for a stay of the injunction...<br> ...on further U.S. Bombing<br> missions in Cambodia.<br> Congress has already ruled<br> these bombings illegal...<br> ...and they should cease in one<br> week's time on August the 15th.<br> Let's go, Sarun!<br> To the hospital!<br> Information. Information.<br> Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival<br> of flight number 125...<br> ...from Bangkok because<br> of bad weather.<br> Mister, you want taxi?<br> Mister, you want taxi?<br> Good taxi.<br> Shut the fucking blinds, will you?<br> What's all this shit?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought you were the houseboy.<br> I was developing some film.<br> If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.<br> I'm not feeling good.<br> Don't want to yell.<br> I want to be in a good mood.<br> The plane was late, no car.<br> I had to take a taxi here.<br> All I want to do is work.<br> I got you.<br> What the fuck is that on your head?<br> It's a sanitary napkin.<br> I had it soaked in ice.<br> Syd Schanberg.<br> Is Pran there?<br> No, I just came from the airport.<br> Well, if he comes in,<br> would you tell him I'm here?<br> I'll be at the Caf Central, tell him.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> What do you want to eat?<br> Want some eggs?<br> I can't. Somebody told me they faint<br> with fright when you cook them.<br> - What do you want to eat?<br> - What are you having?<br> I'm having a caf complet.<br> I'll have that. And some aspirin.<br> Anything I eat has got to be<br> absolutely dead.<br> That's why I can never eat an oyster.<br> I read somewhere that they put...<br> ...that lemon juice on them<br> just to stun them. You know?<br> What's the difference?<br> An unconscious oyster's just as<br> horrible as the fucker wide awake...<br> - My God! Look at this.<br> - Did you see that?<br> What was it? A rocket?<br> I don't know.<br> I saw a guy on a motorbike.<br> I've been looking for you.<br> I left a message for you.<br> I didn't get it.

Anywhere.<br> - Mr. Schanberg...<br> - Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.<br> Dith Pran and family.<br> Right.<br> "Dear sir, my family and I are planning<br> a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...<br> ...and anticipate two weeks<br> in Cambodia touring the country.<br> Would you please send tour<br> information and brochures?<br> Thanking you in advance,<br> Wendell Payne."<br> Wendell lives in Wisacky,<br> South Carolina.<br> What about the airlift?<br> We're taking it with us.<br> - People will starve to death.<br> - I know, but what can we do?<br> Look, there could be a bloodbath here.<br> Excuse the pun, but we're<br> either staying or we're living.<br> Hello, leaving a sinking ship then,<br> are we, Carver?<br> President Ford, in his foreign policy<br> speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...<br> ...except to say that, as of now,<br> it may be too late.<br> I'm sorry.

Let me see him!<br> You tell me where he is.<br> I want to speak to him!<br> The picture in Cambodia<br> is increasingly unclear.<br> Journalists who have flown<br> from Thailand over Phnom Penh...<br> ...report that the Khmer Rouge<br> have attempted...<br> ...a mass evacuation<br> of the entire population.<br> Radio contact with the French Embassy<br> reveals that some 200 Europeans...<br> ...and an undisclosed number<br> of Cambodians have taken refuge.<br> As yet, no statement has been made<br> by the new rulers of Cambodia.<br> The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk<br> and the Khmer Rouge leadership...<br> ...are not clear.<br> - Okay?<br> - Yes. He's sleeping.<br> That's the consul.<br> - Did you see that, Dennis?<br> - The Russians are coming.<br> Look, piss off! Please!<br> Get out! You won't get<br> anything here! Out!<br> First, the main points of the news.<br> BBC, Dougal.<br> - Daily reports of fighting<br> around the airport...<br> ...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh,<br> the capital of Cambodia.<br> And now, an on-the-spot report<br> from our correspondent in Thailand...<br> ...Hugh Elder.<br> Where do they get this crap?<br> Do you see that guy across the gate?<br> The little guy?<br> Could we not all look at once, please?<br> I have it on reliable sources<br> that that's Hugh Elder.<br> You're kidding.<br> He's disguised, but I got suspicious<br> about him. You know what I mean?<br> - How does he get copy out?<br> - How does he get his copy out?<br> With specially trained hens.<br> The BBC has, like, commissioned<br> them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...<br> ...like their regular fowl.<br> They've been crossing the border into<br> Thailand every day and every night.<br> I told you.<br> Unconfirmed reports say<br> the Khmer Rouge are demanding...<br> ...that any officials of<br> the defeated Lon Nol government...<br> ...especially the so-called<br> Six Traitors of the Cabinet...<br> ...be handed over to them.<br> It is not known whether<br> any of the ex-ministers...<br> ...may have taken refuge<br> in the embassy...<br> ...where, in the words of a UNICEF<br> representative in Bangkok...<br> ...the situation is said to be<br> "increasingly precarious."<br> And when I tried to go<br> just a kilometer further, no.<br> The only sense I can make of it<br> is that there's...<br> ...some sort of internal<br> power struggle going on.<br> Different groups seem to be<br> holding different parts of the city...<br> ...and they all appear to be equally<br> nervous over losing power and control.<br> Half of them are under 15.<br> Some Red Cross instruction<br> sheets want translating.<br> Can you help?<br> Use Pran. He speaks French<br> better than I do.<br> I'd prefer it if it was you.<br> What did you do that for?<br> The guy's insecure enough already.<br> The Cambodians have<br> to leave the embassy.<br> They want all our passports<br> and everybody downstairs...<br> ...and the Cambodians out.<br> If you have papers,<br> you have a name.<br> If we have a name,<br> we can find the mother.<br> Look, I fight for five years.<br> Useless war.<br> Fuck!<br> Pran is not gonna last<br> five minutes out there.<br> The Khmer Rouge have killed every<br> journalist they've ever caught.<br> Does Syd know how serious this is?<br> - Of course he bloody knows!<br> - We can't let him walk out of here.<br> Look, two passports. This one's<br> out-of-date, but the visa's valid.<br> Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.<br> Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain,<br> and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.<br> Change my photograph for one of Pran,<br> and he's a British subject.<br> It's worth a try.<br> I hope he's got a photo because<br> I don't have any fucking film.<br> I try to escape to Thailand right now.<br> Give me two or three weeks.<br> If you get there first, let me know.<br> And leave message for me<br> at Reuters. Okay?<br> Just give me an hour.<br> I need some time to think.<br> I got no time to give you.<br> Swain's got an idea.<br> Ankertill Brewer.<br> That's the new name.<br> - Ankertill Brewer.<br> - Right. Now, my photograph.<br> - Change my photograph for yours.<br> - Do you have an old photo?<br> I don't think so.<br> Give him your passport.<br> Your old passport,<br> a family snapshot, anything.<br> Khmer Rouge took everything.<br> - What about your press card?<br> - Everything!<br> Fuck!<br> - Didn't give it back.<br> - We'll go and find some film.<br> There's film here. We'll get it.<br> Polaroid, any kind, any speed.<br> We're gonna get it,<br> and I'll shoot it, okay?<br> We'll find the film.<br> Do you have a Polaroid camera?<br> Do you have film?<br> No, I haven't got any film!<br> I've also got no metronidazole, and<br> this child has got amebic dysentery!<br> We've gotta get sulfide<br> and a developer.<br> If we can get that,<br> I can make the photo.<br> Shit!<br> Listen, I know where we can get<br> some water. We can drain...<br> ...the air conditioning vent.<br> I've seen it done. Come on.<br> Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?<br> I've been told that you're<br> in charge of bed covers.<br> What?<br> Blankets. We've just arrived.<br> We want some blankets.<br> Come on down here.<br> Go to the end of the hall there.<br> Turn to the right,<br> go up the stairs.<br> If there are any, they'll be<br> at the top of the stairs.<br> Syd, I have got the camera...<br> ...I have got the film...<br> ...and I have got<br> the fucking darkroom!<br> All right. Don't smile.<br> - You're smiling.<br> - Very serious. You are smiling.<br> Stop, please.<br> - Very serious.<br> - Very serious, very American.<br> Okay, cover it.<br> This fucking paper, I don't know.<br> That was the stuff you found<br> in the coatroom.<br> Ankertill Brewer.<br> Ankertill Brewer.<br> Getting an image.<br> Look at it.<br> Look, the bugger's face.<br> It sure is. Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Now fix it.<br> That's good.<br> Oh, no.

The solution's<br> too strong. It's fading.<br> Take it out now.<br> I mean, if it's...<br> Fuck!<br> Goddamn it!<br> Man, this fucking room is killing me.<br> Could I just...?<br> I'll just do it myself, okay?<br> Let me just have a few feet<br> in here by myself.<br> Fuck.<br> Sorry.<br> That's it.<br> It's perfect.<br> Perfect.<br> Welcome to New York. We got it.<br> Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!<br> Ankertill Brewer.

That's to be confirmed.<br> It's almost certainly for Thailand.<br> These so-called journalists<br> have no right...<br> You're not biased? You haven't<br> seen any atrocities in Cambodia?<br> - It's just an emotional spasm!<br> - Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!<br> You have to break eggs<br> to make an omelet!<br> Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.<br> - Thank you.

It's not.<br> She doesn't believe you...<br> ...because she knows<br> her husband is dead.<br> You're a good man.<br> If your mother needs anything,<br> make sure she gets in touch with me.<br> You better go.<br> For the past 5 years...<br> ...as indicated on this map<br> that you see here...<br> ...North Vietnam has occupied<br> military sanctuaries...<br> ...all along the Cambodian frontier<br> with South Vietnam.<br> As the President spoke...<br> ...American troops were preparing<br> to move into Cambodia.<br> The decision to invade, like<br> the earlier secret decision to bomb...<br> ...was withheld from<br> the Cambodian people.<br> We will yell at the top of our lungs.<br> We will move.<br> It's the fear that makes a man<br> so scared, you know?<br> There are no American<br> combat advisors in Cambodia.<br> There will be no American<br> combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.<br> We will aid Cambodia.<br> Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine<br> in its purest form.<br> Sydney...<br> ...I think of you often<br> and often my family.<br> They tell us that God is dead.<br> And now the party they call<br> the Angka...<br> ...will provide everything for us.<br> He says Angka has identified...<br> ...and proclaims the existence...<br> ...of a bad new disease...<br> ...a memory sickness diagnosed<br> as thinking too much about life...<br> ...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.<br> He says we are surrounded by enemies.<br> The enemy is inside us.<br> No one can be trusted.<br> We must be like the ox...<br> ...and have no thought<br> except for the Party.<br> No love but for the Angka.<br> People starve...<br> ...but we must not grow food.<br> We must honor the comrade children...<br> ...whose minds are not corrupted<br> by the past.<br> Is anybody of us...<br> ...a doctor...<br> ...professor...<br> ...and student?<br> Angka needs you.<br> Angka has forgiven all the past.<br> Sydney...<br> ...Angka says that those<br> who were guilty of soft living...<br> ...in the years<br> of the great struggle...<br> ...and did not care for the sufferings<br> of the peasant must confess...<br> ...because now is the year zero...<br> ...and everything is to start anew.<br> I'm full of fear, Sydney.<br> I must show no understanding.<br> Not of French or English.<br> I must have no past, Sydney.<br> This is the year zero...<br> ...and nothing has gone before.<br> The wind whispers of fear and hate.<br> The war has killed love, Sydney.<br> And those who confess<br> to the Angka vanish.<br> And no one dare ask where they go.<br> Here, only the silent survive.<br> Mercedes, number one!<br> Anyone who knows my work will know<br> that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.<br> Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able<br> to file half the stories I did.<br> It's nice to congratulate ourselves<br> on occasions like this.<br> But I can't stand here tonight...<br> ...without thinking<br> of those innocent people...<br> ...Pran dedicated himself to helping<br> me bring to the notice of the public.<br> As they pondered their options<br> in the White House...<br> ...the men who decided to bomb<br> and then to invade Cambodia...<br> ...concerned themselves<br> with many things:<br> Great power conflicts<br> and collapsing dominoes...<br> ...looking tough and dangerous<br> to the North Vietnamese...<br> ...relieving pressure on the American<br> troop withdrawal from the South.<br> They had domestic concerns as well...<br> ...which helps explain why they kept<br> the bombing of Cambodia a secret.<br> And they may be assumed not to have<br> ignored self-interest...<br> ...in their own careers.<br> What they specifically were not<br> concerned with...<br> ...were the Cambodians themselves.<br> Not the people...<br> ...not the society...<br> ...not the country.<br> Except in the abstract<br> as instruments of policy.<br> Dith Pran and I...<br> ...tried to record and bring home...<br> ...the concrete consequences<br> of these decisions to real people.<br> To human beings...<br> ...the people left out<br> of the Administration's plans...<br> ...but who paid the price...<br> ...and took the beating for them.<br> I'm very pleased to accept this<br> on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.<br> I'm very honored...<br> ...and I know that Pran would be<br> very proud.<br> Do you plan to continue<br> with that theme in the future?<br> Congratulations, Ernie.<br> Do it again next year!<br> I'm sorry.<br> - That was great, really good.<br> - Better than last year.<br> Abe, meet my sister.<br> I'm very happy to meet you.<br> That's my dad.<br> Would you hold this for me?<br> One second.<br> I hoped you could recommend<br> a good school for journalism.<br> I told my daughter I'd be<br> seeing you today.<br> Just one minute, okay?<br> I'll be right back.<br> Could I have your autograph?<br> I'm a great admirer of yours.<br> Congratulations on your award,<br> it was well-deserved.<br> Very impressive.<br> I was hoping you'd burst into song.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - You know what bothers me?<br> What?<br> It bothers me that you let Pran<br> stay in Cambodia...<br> ...because you wanted to win,<br> and you knew you needed him...<br> - I didn't have any idea what...<br> - The fuck you didn't!<br> The fuck you didn't.<br> I did everything I could,<br> and I'm doing everything I can.<br> Nice to see you.<br> I'm on my way to Florida.<br> I'm doing everything I can.<br> I'm sure. I didn't realize<br> you'd been out there to see him.<br> Don't play games with me, Al.<br> Don't play stupid games.<br> Nobody gets to go in there.<br> If I thought I could, I would.<br> I've sent out hundreds of photographs.<br> Every relief organization<br> on the Thai-Kampuchean border...<br> ...has got his picture. If I saw<br> one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.<br> Life isn't a '40s movie.<br> You can't just get on a plane and<br> make the whole world come out right!<br> And I can't believe<br> I'm hearing this from you!<br> Congrats.<br> Do you keep in touch<br> with Dith Pran's family?<br> Yes. They're living in San Francisco.<br> How do you respond to accusations<br> that journalists...<br> ...underestimated the brutality<br> of the Khmer Rouge...<br> ...and so share responsibility for<br> what happened in Cambodia afterwards?<br> We made a mistake.<br> Maybe we underestimated<br> the kind of insanity...<br> ...that $ 7 billion worth<br> of bombing could produce.<br> That is provocative...<br> There have been a lot of refugee<br> stories in Reader's Digest...<br> ...about Cambodia.<br> Do you believe them?<br> Don't you believe them?<br> Maybe in this instance the<br> Reader's Digest happens to be correct.<br> Do you apply the same disbelief<br> to stories...<br> ...that come out of Iran<br> or Palestine or Chile?<br> Are refugees your next area<br> of interest?<br> Will you be covering the boat people?<br> No, I will not.<br> Do you want a cup of tea?<br> Are you looking around for some kind<br> of more salable suffering?<br> I must have sent 500 letters.<br> I wrote the International Red Cross,<br> the World Health Organization.<br> I know you did, Syd.<br> You told me.<br> I don't know who I didn't write to.<br> I never really gave him any choice.<br> One time we tried to discuss leaving.<br> I talked to him about it,<br> but we never really discussed it.<br> I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.<br> But I never discussed it with him.<br> He stayed because<br> I wanted him to stay.<br> And I stayed because...<br> I'm trapped, Sydney.<br> I know he suspects me,<br> and yet he treats me well.<br> There are many different groups<br> over here, Sydney.<br> I must take much care.<br> Now Angka says we have new enemies.<br> They say we must regain<br> our old lands from the Vietnamese.<br> And now they say we must fight them.<br> I miss you, my wife, my children.<br> And my heart hungers for news of you.<br> New China Radio reports...<br> ...that fighting between Vietnam<br> and Democratic Kampuchea...<br> ...has broken out<br> on a number of fronts.<br> This is in retaliation,<br> according to the Vietnamese...<br> ...for a number of attacks<br> on border villages...<br> Taxi driver, huh?<br> I think you speak English.<br> Sit down.<br> You know, I love this country.<br> I sacrificed everything for it.<br> My wife died for the revolution.<br> But the leaders of Angka<br> no longer trust the people.<br> Therefore, I can no longer trust them.<br> And they don't trust me.<br> I fear...<br> ...really fear for the future.<br> I think you love my son.<br> For his sake...<br> ...look after him.<br> The fighting is close by, Sydney.<br> If the Vietnamese get here...<br> ...Angka will destroy everything...<br> ...and the Vietnamese,<br> they will find only ashes.<br> I must try to stop the killing.<br> Good luck.<br> Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.<br> Ann, get me 415-555-6421.<br> Abe, I've got some great news!<br> Twenty minutes ago, I get<br> a phone call from Paris.<br> I get Andreas Freund.<br> He talked to Henry.<br> He told him how to get in touch<br> with me.<br> Freund says, "I have got<br> some great news for you."<br> - San Francisco's on the line.<br> - "It's about Pran!"<br> Is your mother there?<br> When?<br> All right,<br> I want you to get this down.<br> No, write it down. Write it down.<br> I've got a message from your dad!<br> How you been?<br> Do you forgive me?<br> Nothing to forgive, Sydney.<br> Nothing.<br>
