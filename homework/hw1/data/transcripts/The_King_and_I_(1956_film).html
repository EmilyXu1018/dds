Your Highness.<br> How nice of you<br> to come to say goodbye.<br> Mrs. Anna, I do not come for myself.<br> I come for one<br> who must see you quickly.<br> You may tell His Majesty<br> I am no longer subject to him.<br> You do not understand.<br> Mrs. Anna...<br> ...he is dying!<br> Dying?<br> The king?<br> Oh, no, Lady Thiang. What happened?<br> Who can say what it is<br> that makes a man die?<br> A sad heart that no longer wishes<br> to go on beating?<br> Ever since night of great banquet,<br> he has shut himself away in palace...<br> ...turning from all<br> who would speak to him...<br> ...unwilling to sleep<br> or to nourish himself...<br> ...searching through many books,<br> only to push them aside in despair.<br> Doctors warned him he must<br> change his ways quickly...<br> ...but he would not listen, Mrs. Anna.<br> He would not listen.<br> I had no idea.<br> Everyone who knew<br> was forbidden to speak of it.<br> And now, doctors have no hope for him.<br> Mrs. Anna.<br> Your Highness.<br> I am frightened, Mrs. Anna.<br> I am frightened<br> because I love my father...<br> ...and also because if he dies,<br> I shall be king.<br> And I do not know how to be.<br> Many men learn this after<br> they become kings, Your Highness.<br> It will be good to think back...<br> ...on all that<br> Mrs. Anna has taught you.<br> When king heard you were sailing<br> tonight, he started to write letter.<br> It was difficult for him, Mrs. Anna.<br> Very difficult.<br> He has commanded<br> that I give it to you.<br> Please, may I hear what<br> my father has said, Mrs. Anna?<br> "While I am lying here...<br> ...I think perhaps I die.<br> This heart which you say<br> I have not got...<br> ...is matter of concern.<br> It occurs to me that there shall be<br> nothing wrong that men shall die.<br> For all that matters about man...<br> ...is that he shall have tried<br> his utmost best.<br> In looking back, I discover that<br> you think much on those people...<br> ...who require that you live up<br> to best of self.<br> You have spoken truth to me always...<br> ...and for this I have often<br> lost my temper on you.<br> But now I do not wish to die...<br> ...without saying this gratitude...<br> ...and large respect,<br> et cetera, et cetera.<br> I think it very strange...<br> ...that a woman shall have been<br> most earnest help of all.<br> But, Mrs. Anna, you must remember...<br> ...that you have been<br> a very difficult woman...<br> ...and much more difficult<br> than generality. "<br> We must hurry back now.<br> You will come?<br> Mother...<br> ...now that the king is dying...<br> ...does that make you friends again?<br> I suppose so, Louis.<br> We can't hurt each other anymore.<br> He always frightened me.<br> I wish you had known him better.<br> You two could have been<br> such good friends.<br> In many ways he was<br> just as young as you.<br> Was he as good a king<br> as he could have been?<br> I don't think any man has ever been<br> as good a king as he could have been.<br> But this one tried.<br> He tried very hard.<br> You really like him,<br> don't you, Mother?<br> Yes, Louis.<br> I like him very much.<br> Very much indeed.<br> Several weeks...<br> ...I do not see you, Mrs. Anna.<br> And now I die.<br> Oh, no, Your Majesty.<br> This is not scientific.<br> I know...<br> ...if I die or do not die.<br> You shouldn't be here.<br> Can't we move you to your room?<br> No.<br> I wish to remain here<br> in room with knowledge.<br> You are leaving Siam?<br> When?<br> Very soon, Your Majesty.<br> In fact, I can stay<br> only a few more minutes.<br> And you are glad of this?<br> People of Siam...<br> ...royal children, et cetera...<br> ...are not glad.<br> And all are in great affliction...<br> ...of your departure.<br> I shall miss them.<br> You shall miss them...<br> ...but you shall be leaving.<br> I, too...<br> ...am leaving.<br> Only I'm not walking onto a boat...<br> ...with my own feet...<br> ...of my own free will.<br> I am just leaving.<br> Why is your head higher than mine?<br> Here.<br> Here is something belonging to you.<br> Put it on.<br> Put it on, put it on.<br> Please...<br> ...wear it.<br> The children.<br> Let my children come in.<br> Good evening, children.<br> Good evening, my father.<br> - Please, do not go. We'll miss you!<br> - Children!<br> Stop this noise.<br> Did you come to see your father<br> or Mrs. Anna?<br> It is all right, Lady Thiang.<br> It is suitable.<br> My father.<br> Princess Ying Yaowalak.<br> I have wish to-<br> She has memorized message<br> for Mrs. Anna.<br> Speak message now.<br> Say it, say it, say it.<br> Dear friend and teacher...<br> ...my goodness gracious...<br> ...do not go away.<br> We are in great need of you.<br> We are like one blind.<br> Do not let us fall down in darkness.<br> Continue good and sincere...<br> ...concern for us...<br> ...and lead us in right road.<br> Your loving pupil...<br> ...Princess Ying Yaowalak.<br> Mother...<br> ...it's the boat. It's time to go.<br> - Do not go, Mrs. Anna.<br> - Please do not go.<br> No, no, Mrs. Anna!<br> Run down to the boat and ask<br> Capt. Orton to take our things off.<br> Yes, Mother.<br> Silence!<br> There's no reason<br> for doing of demonstration...<br> ...for schoolteacher<br> realizing her duty...<br> ...for which I pay her<br> exorbitant monthly fee...<br> ...of...<br> ...twenty-five pounds.<br> Furthermore...<br> ...this disorganized behavior...<br> ...in presence of dying king.<br> Rise.<br> Mrs. Anna...<br> ...you...<br> ...take notes.<br> You take notes...<br> ...from next king.<br> Well?<br> Suppose you are king.<br> Is there nothing you would do?<br> I...<br> ...would make proclamations.<br> Yes. Yes?<br> First, I would proclaim<br> for coming New Year...<br> ...fireworks.<br> Also boat races.<br> Boat races?<br> Why boat races<br> with New Year's celebration?<br> I like boat races.<br> And, Father, I would make<br> second proclamation.<br> Yes, what is second proclamation?<br> Make it, make it.<br> Regarding custom of bowing to king...<br> ...in fashion of lowly toad.<br> I do not believe this is good thing.<br> Causing embarrassing fatigue<br> of body...<br> ...degrading experience for soul...<br> ...et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<br> This is bad thing.<br> I believe.<br> You are angry with me,<br> my father?<br> Oh, why do you ask question?<br> If you are king...<br> ...you are king!<br> Don't ask question of sick man.<br> Nor...<br> ...of woman.<br> This proclamation...<br> ...against bowing to king...<br> ...I believe to be your fault.<br> Oh, I hope so, Your Majesty.<br> I do hope so.<br> Up! Rise up!<br> Father?<br> Up, up, up!<br> Like soldiers in lines.<br> It has been said.<br> There shall be no more bowing...<br> ...for showing...<br> ...respect...<br> ...for king.<br> It has been said by one...<br> ...who has been trained...<br> ...for royal...<br> ...government.<br> There shall be no bowing like toad.<br> No crouching.<br> No crawling.<br> This does not mean, however,<br> that you do not show respect for king.<br> You will stand with shoulders back...<br> ...and chin high, like this.<br> You will face king<br> with proud expression...<br> ...showing pride in self<br> as well as in king.<br> This is proper way for men<br> to show esteem for one another...<br> ...by looking upon each other's faces<br> with calmness of spirit...<br> ...eyes meeting eyes in equal gaze...<br> ...bodies upright, standing as men<br> were meant to stand...<br> ...with dignity and awareness of self.<br> So from this day forward...<br>
