Ar Mo!!<br> Ar Mo!!! Ar Mo!!<br> Ar Mo!!! Ar Mo!!<br> This is the detention center of<br> the Fushun Bureau of public security.<br> And I am the governor!<br> During the war, this was a<br> Japanese prison.<br> Many of you may remember it.<br> Because you worked with the Japanese,<br> you were responsible for building it and<br> you filled it with innocent people.<br> How could this happen?!<br> Why did you betray your<br> country?!<br> What turned you into war<br> criminals?<br> We believe that men are<br> born good!<br> We believe that the only way to<br> change is to discover the truth<br> and look at it in the face.<br> That is why you are here.<br> You will begin by writing<br> the story of your lives<br> and by confessing your crimes.<br> Your salvation will lie entirely<br> the attitude you take!<br> I advise you to be frank and<br> sincere, otherwise things can<br> still go very badly for you.<br> After a few years, the tiny republic had<br> become as corrupt as the old emperor.<br> It fell quickly into the hands of ambitions<br> generals and corrupt bureaucrats.<br> The era of the warlords had begun. By May,<br> China was in turmoil.<br> May the new tutor present<br> himself!<br> Your lmperial Highness,<br> the new tutor.<br> Dear lmperial Highness,<br> Mr. Reginald Fleming Johnston.<br> How do you do, Mr, Johnston?<br> How do you do, Your Majesty?<br> Now we will go to school.<br> Your Majesty, in my country, it<br> would be usual to begin with<br> some kind of an examination.<br> The Emperor can't be<br> examined.<br> Well, that may have to change.<br> But first, Your Majesty might<br> like to ask me some questions.<br> Where are your ancestors<br> buried?<br> In Scotland, Your Majesty.<br> But then, where's your skirt?<br> In your country, men wear short skirts,<br> do they not?<br> No, Your Majesty. Scotsmen do not<br> wear skirts, they wear kilts.<br> Kilts.<br> Kilts. A matter of words, perhaps,<br> but words are important.<br> Why are words important?<br> If you can't say what you<br> mean, Your majesty, you will<br> never mean what you say.<br> And a gentleman should always<br> means what he says.<br> Ah yes! "a gentleman".<br> Are you a gentleman?<br> I would like to be a gentleman,<br> Your Majesty. I try to be.<br> I'm not a gentleman. I'm not<br> allowed to say what I mean.<br> They are always telling me<br> what to say.<br> Your Majesty is still very<br> young.<br> I thought he might like to see some<br> English and American magazines.<br> I have just received<br> them.<br> I know that you know that I<br> know that you know that,<br> that is a dialog between<br> Confucius and Chuang Tzu.<br> Concerning respect, Your Majesty.<br> Who is this "George Washington"?<br> A famous American, Your majesty.<br> A revolutionary General.<br> The first American President.<br> Ah! Like Mr, Lenin in Russia?<br> Not quite.<br> Dose he have a car?<br> He lived a long time ago, Your Majesty.<br> I want a car.<br> I think your mouse is trying to<br> escape, Your Majesty.<br> Please do not tell anyone about<br> my mouse.<br> The lesson is finished.<br> Our official taster's a brave<br> men.<br> Many of my ancestors<br> have been poisoned, you know.<br> Does Your Majesty have lunch<br> like this everyday?<br> Oh, yes! Every day!<br> Like theater!<br> I don't know why.<br> It has always been like that.<br> How do they kill emperors in<br> the West?<br> The Austrian emperor was shot, was he not?<br> No, but his nephew was assassinated<br> before the Great War.<br> But the Russian emperor had<br> been shot. He was called the Tsar.<br> Yes.<br> He took lots of our land in<br> Manchuria.<br> I'm a Manchrian. Even after the republic,<br> it's still country.<br> The-uh... secret, Your Majesty,<br> is emerging again.<br> Is something the matter, Your Majesty?<br> Something is happening.<br> What is happening,<br> Mr, johnston?<br> Uh nothing is happening...<br> /Quiet!<br> On my way here, Your Majesty,<br> we were held up by students<br> from the university.<br> They were protesting against the<br> republican government.<br> because it has agreed to give<br> away Chinese territory to Japan.<br> It is true, Mr, Johnston, that<br> many people out there have had<br> their heads chopped off?<br> It is true, Your Majesty.<br> Many heads have been chopped off.<br> It does stop them thinking.<br> It is time for the Emperor's rest.<br> The students are right to be<br> angry.<br> I am angry!<br> But I am not allowed<br> to leave the Forbidden City.<br> I want to go out,<br> Mr, Johnston!<br> My lord!<br> I want to see the City of sounds!<br> The Emperor awards you with<br> the order of the Ruby Hat Button,<br> and with the right to be carried in your<br> own chair, with four bearers.<br> I hope the Emperor has not<br> forgotten that this is the<br> day for his math class?<br> For Your Majesty!<br> My doctor says,<br> "Bicycles are bad for you".<br> Bad for you, nonsense!<br> How does it work?<br> Oh, it's simple.<br> Head up and eyes forward!<br> As in math!<br> My mother is dead, is she not?<br> Yes, Your Majesty.<br> I'm profoundly sorry!<br> I'm not.<br> She killed herself.<br> She swallowed the ball of opium.<br> I'm going to see her, and my brother.<br> Open the door. Open the door.<br> Open the door.<br> Fallen devil and fallen machine.<br> Trouble! Nothing but trouble!<br> Look where you lead him!<br> And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man.<br> The boy's mother is dead,<br> and he's not even allowed to see her!<br> I want to go home!!<br> I want to go home!!<br> Stop it, stay where you are!!<br> I want to go home!!<br> Stop it, stay where you are!!<br> You fool!! Stay there!!<br> Chang!<br> Hunchback, Bigfoot!<br> Sir? Give me your hand, sir.<br> Give me your hand, sir!<br> Can you not see?<br> Look at my left ear, please, sir.<br> Thank you, and my right.<br> Thank you.<br> Would you follow my finger, please, sir-<br> Well it's perfectly simple,<br> Johnson. The emperor needs spectacles.<br> Like Harold Lloyd!<br> Impossible!<br> An emperor does<br> not wear spectacles!<br> That can't be allowed!<br> Time have changed,<br> Your Highnesses!<br> If His Majesty doesn't get spectacles,<br> Johnston, he could lose his sight.<br> Your Majesty.<br> If the Emperor does not get<br> spectacles, I will resign.<br> Unfortunately,<br> our decision is final.<br> And unfortunately, what I have to say will be<br> published in every newspaper in China.<br> What do you have to say,<br> Mr, Johnston?<br> The Emperor has been a prisoner<br> in his own place since the day<br> that he was crowned and has remained<br> a prisoner since he abdicated.<br> But now he's growing up. He may<br> wonder why he is the only person in China<br> who may not walk out of<br> his own front door.<br> I think the Emperor is the<br> loneliest boy on earth.<br> It would be conveniently sad<br> if he becomes blind.<br> Blind, Mr, Johnston?<br> To the expense, Your Excellency.<br> To the cost of maintaining one<br> thousand two hundred eunuchs,<br> three hundred and fifty<br> ladies-in-waiting.<br> and one hundred and eight-five<br> cooks to buying one hundred.<br> and twenty sable furs a month<br> and three thousand chickens a<br> week.<br> To the fast that eight hundred<br> and forty guards and employees<br> of the household department,<br> plus one Lord Chamberlain,<br> care only about one thing!<br> Filling their own rice bowls!<br> You are very good at accounts,<br> Mr, Johnston!<br> The Emperor may have abdicated,<br> but he is still a symbol<br> of great importance to many people.<br> If I did not agree with that,<br> I would not be here.<br> And some of us believe that one day soon,<br> he may be more than a symbol.<br> The spectacles are a detail.<br> What do you really want,<br> Mr, Johnston?<br> Ah-Just the spectacles.<br> The Princess Wan Jung,<br> Your Majesty.<br> Seventeen years old.<br> Princess Wu Chang,<br> fifteen years old.<br> The princess De Li,<br> Your Majesty.<br> And the Princess Fung Ying.<br> Who is this?<br> Princess Wen Hsiu,<br> twelve years old.<br> She has got a funny face.<br> Notjust one wife. One empress<br> and one secondary consort.<br> Two wives?<br> But who do you choose to be<br> the Empress?<br> They chose her!<br> She's very old, Johnston!<br> She's seventeen!<br> That's not so old, Your Majesty.<br> What does she look like?<br> Old fashion!<br> I want a modern wife, Johnston,<br> who speaks English and French!<br> And who can dance the<br> quickstep!<br> Johnston!!<br> Sir!<br> I'm going to escape, Johnston.<br> I've got a suitcase,<br> and a ticket to England.<br> I'm going to Oxford University.<br> Your Majesty, if you get married<br> you will become the master<br> of your own house.<br> A wedding might be a more<br> practical way to escape.<br> Why did you never get married,<br> Johnston?<br> The secondary consort<br> welcomes the Empress greets<br> the secondary consort.<br> You are doing everything very well.<br> Thank you.<br> I rehearsed many times.<br> What is His Majesty thinking?<br> I was thinking, if I was the real emperor,<br> I would become the ruler of China now.<br> And what would the Emperor do,<br> if he could really rule?<br> I would change everything.<br> Even the way we get married.<br> Is the Emperor against arranged<br> marriages?<br> It is humiliating not to choose<br> whom you marry!<br> Even I was not allowed<br> to choose.<br> In another year or two.<br> His Majesty will be<br> taller than me.<br> Is it true the Emperor has a suitcase<br> under his bed and is going to Oxford?<br> Will the Emperor take Wan Jung<br> with him?<br> Perhaps he would like to<br> see my face before he decides.<br> Yes, the Emperor would like to<br> see the face of the Empress.<br> It is the Emperor who must<br> remove the kait'ou.<br> I also had a tutor like Mr, Johnston.<br> Miss Windsor. She's American.<br> Miss Windsor taught me how to<br> do the dance of the quickstep.<br> Does the Emperor know hoe to<br> do the quickstep?<br> Will you teach me?<br> Leave us! Leave us!<br> If Your Majesty thinks it is old<br> fashioned to make the rain and<br> the wind with a stranger,<br> we can be like a modern couple,<br> to begin with.<br> A modern couple?<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> You must come to Oxford<br> with me.<br> I like him!<br> I'm sure I'm going to like him!<br> And he will grow up!<br> Eyes down!<br> Report your arrival!<br> Prisoner nine-eight-one<br> reporting.<br> Louder!!<br> Prisoner nine-eight-one<br> reporting.<br> Open the door!<br> Close the door!<br> Sit down!<br> Name?!<br> Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.<br> Write it!<br> Now read that aloud!<br> We call them<br> toothpaste and water tap.<br> The toothpaste prisoner needs to be<br> squeezed every now and then or else<br> he forgets, to keep confessing.<br> The water tap man needs one good<br> hard twist before he starts.<br> But them everything comes out.<br> Now, you're an intelligent person.<br> I'm sure you understand me.<br> Good.<br> Then we will begin.<br> Why do you think you are<br> in here, nine-eight-one?<br> I'm accused of being a traitor a collaborate<br> and a counter-revolutionary.<br> It's not an accusation!!<br> You are a traitor, you are a collaborator and<br> you're a counter-revolutionary!<br> Did you write this?<br> And you call it a confession?<br> This is noting but a list of dates!<br> A child's fairy tale!<br> What do you want me to confess?<br> You know what you did and<br> what others did.<br> So why don't you<br> volunteer the information?<br> I don't understand.<br> We don't tell people what to confess.<br> We already know everything about you.<br> I...<br> Go on.<br> I wanted reforms.<br> What did you what to reform?<br> Everything.<br> Cut off my queue.<br> Your majesty! Please!<br> It's heavy!<br> The emperor before me was murdered<br> because he wanted to reform the empire.<br> Is that not so, Mr, Johnston?<br> Yes, Your Majesty. Probably.<br> Well, let us see if they will kill me for<br> reforming the Forbidden City.<br> Lord Chamberlain!<br> I'm appointing<br> Mr, Johnston's friend,<br> the poet and scholar,<br> Chin Hsiao Hsiu,<br> to be the new Lord Chamberlain.<br> I want him to supervise a detailed<br> inventory of the imperial storerooms!<br> So that we can learn exactly<br> how much has been stolen!<br> Can I sleep here?<br> I'm frightened.<br> You're brave.<br> Are you not frightened?<br> I'm excited.<br> I don't want to escape anymore.<br> I want to rule.<br> Kiss me.<br> Can I stay with you as well?<br> Get in. Get in.<br> I used to play a game with the eunuchs.<br> Trying to guess who is who.<br> Now I can't see you!<br> Jung!<br> Wan Jung?<br> When Hsiu?<br> Come underneath the sheet with us.<br> Your Majesty!<br> The storeroom's on fire,<br> Your Majesty!<br> What are they carrying?<br> Their organs.<br> Whatever their crimes, they can't<br> be deprived of the right to<br> be buried as whole men.<br> Well?!<br> I have forgot what<br> I was saving.<br> You're wasting our time!<br> We want to know about the Japanese.<br> How did your friendship<br> with the Japanese begin?<br> Who introduced you?!<br> When?!<br> Hmm, I think it was... it was 1924.<br> Parliament had been dissolved again.<br> The president had fled.<br> At first, I thought it was just another a<br> coup d'etat by just another warlord.<br> Only this time it was different.<br> This time it was my turn.<br> Fifteen, love<br> Play.<br> Thirty, fifteen.<br> The rotten government of<br> the republic is in flight!<br> Now we shall remove the foreign<br> stench of the Manchurian rats who<br> still hide in the Forbidden City.<br> Mr, Pu Yi and his family have been given<br> one hour to leave the Forbidden City.<br> They will be escorted<br> to the home of his father.<br> and remain there under guard as state<br> prisoners until further notice!!<br> What are you all looking at?<br> What are you standing there for?<br> You always wanted to leave<br> the Forbidden City.<br> Now you're got an hour to park.<br> So, go! Go!<br> I always thought I hated it here.<br> Now, I'm afraid to leave.<br> Do you think they will kill me?<br> You must do as they say, Your majesty,<br> while I try to reach the British embassy.<br> They will give you asylum there.<br> I'm sure will.<br> Chang, take my car to the South gate!<br> I want to drive His Majesty.<br> Your Majesty!<br> Please, Your Majesty!<br> What? But you didn't go to<br> the British embassy, did you?<br> You ended up at the Japanese embassy.<br> The Japanese were the only people<br> prepared to help me.<br> Help you for nothing?<br> Japan has an emperor.<br> We're almost the same age.<br> I thought it was kindness.<br> At the same time I realized that<br> for many Chinese I was alien.<br> Simply because I'm Manchurian.<br> There was even an anti-Manchurian<br> league who wanted to assassinate me!<br> So, I want to live in Tientsin.<br> It was a nice provincial town<br> with a big port.<br> In those days, we had a large,<br> international settlement.<br> The Japanese thought it would<br> safer for me there.<br> Were the Japanese paying<br> for you in Tientsin?<br> Oh! No.<br> I had to rent a villa,<br> The Villa Chan, and it was very expensive.<br> So were the bodyguards.<br> I spent a lot of money in Tientsin.<br> Did you still believe in a restoration<br> of the imperial system?<br> Others did.<br> They were later caught and exiled.<br> I can't remember how much jade<br> and jewelry they made me<br> spend to buy the friendship of some warlord<br> or some white Russian general.<br> And what else did you spend<br> your money on?<br> Oh, I was never tired of buying pianos,<br> watches, radios...<br> As long as they were foreign!<br> Of course.<br> Anything Western was good.<br> Especially Wrigley's chewing gum,<br> Bayer aspirin and cars.<br> While you were in Tientsin, most<br> of China came under the control<br> of General Chiang Kie Shek,<br> the so-called Nationalists,<br> the Kuomintang.<br> What were your relations with them?<br> None.<br> I felt useless in Tientsin.<br> I was twenty-one.<br> I dreamt of going to the West.<br> I became a playboy.<br> Am I blue. Am I blue.<br> Ain't these tears in my eyes<br> telling you am I blue?<br> You'd be too If each plan with<br> your girl done fell throught<br> was a time I was her only one.<br> But now I'm the sad and lonely one.<br> Bu-Bu-Booo.

It's a secret.<br> Oh, I know everything!<br> I know Chiang Kai Shek has got false teeth.<br> I even know his nickname,<br> "cash my check!"<br> I'm a spy.<br> I don't care who knows it.<br> A spy?<br> I work for the Japanese,<br> special service Bureau,<br> and I've come to protect you.<br> The Japanese.<br> They are getting closer to him everyday.<br> He is sending his brother to the<br> military academy in Tokyo.<br> They talk to him about Manchuria<br> all the time.<br> And Mr. Amakasu<br> never says hello to me.<br> I don't trust the Japanese.<br> Of course, I'd love to be the<br> Emperor's new secondary consort!<br> Eastern Jewel.<br> If the post is available.<br> The post is vacant,<br> my dear cousin.<br> But you don't fit the port!<br> Wen Hsiu left the dog behind.<br> Do you want it?<br> It's my fault.<br> It's all my fault.<br> I came to see you, Your Majesty.<br> To give you bad news.<br> Something terrible has happened.<br> The lmperial tombs of our Manchurian<br> ancestors have been attacked and robbed<br> by troops of the Kuomintang<br> Chinese soldiers.<br> A warlord working for<br> Chiang Kai Shek.<br> The body of the Empress Dowager<br> was hacked to pieces.<br> Her pearl necklace has become<br> a wedding present from<br> Ching Kai Shek to his new wife.<br> Tell me, nine-eight-one.<br> Do you consider yourself<br> to be Chinese?<br> Of course.<br> What is this?<br> Japan.<br> And what do you call this part<br> of China?<br> The Northeast.<br> And what did you call it<br> as a child?<br> Manchuria.<br> Japan invaded Manchuria on<br> September eighteenth, 1931.<br> and began to set up a puppet<br> state called Manchukuo.<br> Shortly afterwards, a Japanese delegation<br> paid you a secret visit in Tientsin<br> to request your collaboration,<br> which you say you refused.<br> Speak up!<br> I've already told you<br> I have told you a hundred times.<br> Tell us again! Tell us<br> two-hundred times!<br> I refused to collaborate.<br> You say you refused,<br> but a month later,<br> on November tenth, 1931<br> there your are arriving in Manchuria,<br> or should I call it Manchukuo?!<br> Now, according to this so-called<br> confession of yours, you didn't<br> go of your own free will!<br> - You insist that you were<br> kidnapped by the Japanese! /-Yes.<br> - And taken to Manchuria<br> by force! /-Yes!<br> Sit down!<br> Do you remember a man called<br> Reginald Fleming Johnston?<br> He was your tutor.<br> Yes.<br> And a good friend,<br> I believe.<br> After twenty-eight years in<br> China, Mr, Johnston returned<br> to England.<br> He became a professor<br> of original studies<br> at London University.<br> And he wrote a book. It's called<br> Twilight in the Forbidden City,<br> and it's dedicated to you.<br> Tientsin 1931.<br> I'm going to miss you,<br> Johnston.<br> I shell miss you, Your Majesty.<br> Do you think a man can<br> become emperor again?<br> Yes.<br> Thank you, Your Majesty.<br> How can we say "Good-bye"?<br> As we said, "Hello"<br> Farewell, Mr. Johnston.<br> Farewell, Your Majesty.<br> Good-bye, Mr. Johnston!<br> We'll never forget you, Mr. Johnston.<br> Good-bye! Mr, Johnston.<br> Good-bye! Good-bye!<br> On page four-hundred<br> and forty-nine, Mr. Johnston writes.<br> The endeavor to make out that<br> the Emperor had been kidnapped<br> by the Japanese is wholly untrue.<br> He left Tientsin and went to<br> Manchuria of his own free will.<br> Johnston was a liar!<br> What did you say?<br> I didn't hear you.<br> Mr. Johnston had left before<br> I was taken to Manchuria.<br> He couldn't have known<br> what happened.<br> Sit down!<br> According to this account,<br> you pre-packed the man's things<br> on the morning of November ninth!<br> Isn't it unusual for a man<br> who's kidnapped to have<br> his luggage packed<br> by his valet the day<br> before he's kidnapped?!<br> This is what you've written,<br> isn't it?!<br> Who told you to pack this man's luggage?!<br> These two stories don't fit,<br> do they?<br> It was a long time ago.<br> Perhaps I made a mistake.<br> You are lying!<br> You are both lying!!<br> Control yourself!<br> Request your choice.<br> Request you to change your mind.<br> I'm the hereditary ruler of the<br> Manchurian people.<br> There can be no Manchukuo<br> without me.<br> Do you not see?<br> The Japanese are using you.<br> I must try to use them.<br> The Japanese invasion of<br> Manchuria will be condemned<br> by the League of Nations<br> and by every civilized<br> country on earth!<br> The Chinese Republic had broken every<br> promise it ever made to me!<br> Chinese troops desecrated<br> the tombs of my ancestors!!<br> And Chinese troops didn't defend<br> Manchuria from the Japanese!<br> But Manchuria is still China!<br> China has turned it's back<br> on me.<br> Please, don't go.<br> Manchuria is the richest<br> frontier Asia!<br> Coal, oil, railways!<br> Millions of Chinese immigrants<br> are going there every year!<br> I'm going to build my country.<br> Johnston was wrong,<br> but he wasn't a liar.<br> There was no kidnapped!<br> You went to Manchuria by<br> your own choice, because<br> you wanted to be Emperor again!<br> You will rewrite your confessions<br> from the beginning!<br> Manchuria 1934<br> To heaven.<br> To earth.<br> To the moon.<br> To the sun.<br> You're an empress again.<br> What I'm going to be is a pilot!<br> I'm going to train at a secret<br> base near Yokohama to learn<br> precision-bombing.<br> I want to bomb Shanghai.<br> Bomb Shanghai?<br> I hate China!<br> I hate you.<br> The Japanese Army High Command!<br> Very impressive!<br> The Japanese Army!<br> Quickly!<br> Uh, may I introduce you?<br> My wife, the Princess Hiro Saga.<br> Prime Minister Hsiao Hsiu.<br> Honorable Chang Ching Hui,<br> Minister of Defense.<br> Monseigneur, Colonna.<br> The Empress and I accept with<br> great pleasure.<br> Excuse me, General.<br> Ahh!
