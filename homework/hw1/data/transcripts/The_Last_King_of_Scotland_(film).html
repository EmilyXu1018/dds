Look. Look up there, Tolu.<br> - Do you have monkeys in Scotland?<br> No, we don't have monkeys in Scotland.<br> No. If we had monkeys in Scotland,<br> we'd probably deep-fry them.<br> This is my stop.<br> I'm a medical officer overseas.<br> Dr Garrigan.<br> - Dr Merrit?<br> - No. I'm Sarah, David's wife. Welcome.<br> - Hello.<br> - David was called out on an emergency.<br> - I hope everything's OK.<br> - Just normal business here. Safe journey?<br> - You know.

The radio's full of it.<br> Who's Obote?<br> - Ex-president.<br> - Right. And whatshisname.<br> Amin. He's taken over, yeah?<br> You've certainly come at a busy time.<br> Whatever I can do to help.<br> - Morning, Nicholas.<br> - Morning.<br> - So, what do you think?<br> - Aye, fine.<br> Come on. Come through.<br> This is the operating room.<br> Simple procedures for the most part.<br> - Morning.<br> - Morning.<br> So, how many doctors are there here?<br> Well, there's me and now there's you.<br> - Morning, Sister.<br> - Morning.<br> You know, the interesting thing is,<br> still prefer the witch doctor to us.<br> Sometimes I think we're just<br> skimming the surface of an ocean.<br> - Ready?<br> - Yeah.<br> There we are.<br> There we go.

Cos I don't wear socks and sandals?<br> Touch.<br> I still want to make a difference, you know.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes, really.<br> I wanna have fun, too, though.<br> A bit of adventure, something different.<br> That's a lot of things.<br> Is it?<br> Doctor.<br> A beautiful goal for Scotland.<br> - A good one.<br> - Bonny, why are the women singing?<br> You don't know?<br> The president is coming to the village.<br> Where's Dr Merrit?<br> He has gone to town for stores.<br> Come on. I thought you might be<br> slightly curious to see the new boss.<br> I don't work for Amin.<br> Right. Fine.<br> I just thought it might be fun.<br> OK.<br> OK.<br> Amin.<br> Uganda.<br> Uganda. Uganda.<br> And I want to promise you<br> this will be a government<br> of action, not of words.<br> We will build new schools,<br> new roads<br> and new houses.<br> I may wear<br> the uniform of a general,<br> but...<br> In my heart, I am a simple man<br> like you.<br> I know who you are<br> and everything that you are.<br> I am you.<br> Ask my soldiers.<br> All my life, I never eat food<br> until my soldiers have eaten first.<br> It will be like this in Uganda now.<br> Together, we will make this country better.<br> And stronger.<br> And free.<br> Uganda.<br> Uganda.<br> Uganda.<br> - Have you seen enough now?<br> - What?<br> Have you seen enough now?<br> Just a couple of minutes.<br> - Can we please go now?<br> - OK.<br> They sang just like that for Obote,<br> until they realised he turned their economy<br> into his bank account.<br> - Come on. Give the man a chance.<br> - I'm serious.<br> You talk to me in a couple of years.<br> What's going on?<br> Jesus.<br> - What's the problem?<br> - They're looking for a doctor.<br> - The president's been hurt in an accident.<br> - We have to come. We'll follow you.<br> God. Terrifying.<br> My hand.<br> My hand is broken.<br> Get that farmer out of my sight.<br> Come. Come here.<br> I'm Dr Garrigan. I hear you have a problem<br> with your hand. I'd like to examine it.<br> There you go.<br> Could you just raise your thumb like that?<br> - How's that? Is that OK?<br> - Yeah.<br> Sarah, I think we're gonna need a splint. Can<br> somebody do something about that cow?<br> I don't think you've broken it.<br> I think it's just sprained.<br> Please, it's in pain.<br> Can you hold that there<br> with your other hand, please?<br> Sarah, can you go and talk to that farmer<br> about his cow, please?<br> Sarah, how's it going?<br> - Somebody put that animal out of its misery.<br> - I am trying to explain to them.<br> For God's sake.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - I couldn't hear myself think.<br> - You took my gun.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who are you?<br> Nicholas G... I'm Dr Nicholas Garrigan.<br> I work at the medical compound in Mogambo.<br> - I'm a doctor.<br> - You are British?<br> I'm Scottish. I'm Scottish.<br> Scottish.<br> Why didn't you say so?<br> I fought with the Scots against the Mau Mau.<br> Great soldiers. Very brave.<br> And good people, completely.<br> Let me tell you, if I could be anything<br> instead of a Ugandan, I would be a Scot.<br> Right. Really?<br> Except for the red hair,<br> which I am sure is attractive to your women,<br> but which we Africans,<br> we find this quite disgusting.<br> Thank you, Dr Garrigan. A very good job.<br> Please.<br> Would you let me have this T-shirt?<br> My son Campbell, he would love this T-shirt.<br> - You've got a son called Campbell?<br> - Yeah.<br> Maybe you would take my shirt here<br> in exchange.<br> Right. Of course. Yeah.<br> Thank you.<br> You see? Now you are a general like me.<br> Salute, please.<br> Now I must leave.<br> I bet you that's worth a few bob.<br> I still can't believe how you shot that cow.<br> You're mad.<br> - Anyway, I...<br> - Do you fancy a wee drink on the porch?<br> No, thank you. I'm OK, really.<br> Nicholas, I have to go.<br> Look, it's fine, all right?<br> We're just having a drink.<br> God.<br> I can't do this.<br> What?<br> My husband is a good man.<br> Christ. I sound ridiculous.<br> I guess I just need you<br> to understand why I'm here.<br> - It's OK. I do understand.<br> - No, you don't.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - It's OK.<br> It's just sometimes,<br> when you're married to<br> such a very good man,<br> it's... it makes you feel...<br> Like shit.<br> My father's the same.<br> And...<br> it's nice to be noticed.<br> - I can't. I can't.<br> - Sarah, it's...<br> - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> - It's fine.<br> - No, don't, please.<br> - Sarah, it's fine.<br> Please.<br> Nicholas.<br> Nicholas, there are some people<br> here to see you.<br> I'll be right there, David.<br> Right. Right.<br> - Good morning, Dr Garrigan.<br> - Morning.<br> My name is Jonah Wasswa,<br> Minister of Health.<br> I've been sent by<br> his Excellency President Amin.<br> - There is something he would like to ask you.<br> - What?<br> Sarah?<br> Hey. Listen, why don't you tell David<br> to rearrange the field trip for Friday?<br> I'll be back as soon as I can. He probably just<br> wants me to retie his bandages. See you later.<br> - My name is Masanga.<br> - Nice to meet you. I'm Nicholas.<br> Pleased to meet you, Mr Nicholas.<br> Welcome to the president's car.<br> They think you are the president.<br> They think you are the president.<br> The president's house.<br> Please, sit down.<br> - His Excellency will be with you in a moment.<br> - Who's this?<br> - Dr Junju. The previous incumbent.<br> - Of what?<br> Of the post<br> of personal physician to the president.<br> Hold on to your guns, everyone.<br> Hold on to your guns.<br> Good to see you again, Dr Garrigan.<br> You see, Jonah?<br> This is the sort of man a president needs,<br> someone who is not afraid to speak his mind.<br> So, what do you say, Nicholas?<br> Will you take the job?<br> I'm sorry.<br> You want me to be your physician?<br> - Do you want to be of service to Uganda?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Then what better way<br> than to look after the health of its president?<br> Let me tell you, it will not be a difficult job<br> because me, myself,<br> I am a man in perfect physical condition.<br> Also, I know precisely when I will die.<br> It came to me in a dream.<br> So you do not have to worry<br> about making a mistake.<br> I'm really sorry. I'm very honoured, but...<br> Nicholas, I understand.<br> Me, myself, I did not want to be president,<br> but the people, they wanted it so.<br> Listen to me. This is very important.<br> Here, in Kampala,<br> you will have a hand in creating<br> a new health service for this country,<br> something that will help millions of people.<br> I'm sorry. I do have a commitment<br> to the mission in Mogambo<br> and I'd be letting them down horribly.<br> You see?<br> It's the woman, the one I saw you with.<br> You want to get back to be with her.<br> Not entirely.<br> It's the woman. It's the woman.<br> Why don't you tell her<br> to come and be here with us?<br> It's not that simple. It's complicated.<br> Why?<br> Is she married?<br> Yes, she is.<br> Doctor.<br> Doctor, you, you are very naughty.<br> Me?<br> Now you are even more interesting.<br> Married woman,<br> they are always the most passionate.<br> - It's true.<br> - They are so grateful.<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry for wasting your time.<br> No, no.<br> My car will take you back<br> first thing in the morning.<br> But, in the meantime,<br> tonight we are having a state dinner.<br> - Please, would you join us there?<br> - I'd very much like that. Thank you.<br> You have a suit? A dark suit?<br> No. No, I don't.<br> How much is this gonna cost me, by the way?<br> It's OK. It's on president's account.<br> Can I just...<br> Stop!<br> - What's going on?<br> - Obote's men. They're everywhere.<br> - Really?<br> - Yep.<br> They're communists, you know?<br> Mind you, Amin's more than<br> a match for them.<br> He's ex-British army. King's African Rifles.<br> Jamshid, pack those up<br> and have them sent to the High Commission.<br> OK, thank you.<br> Yes, he's a little unpredictable,<br> but he's got a firm hand.<br> Only thing the African<br> really understands. Thanks, Jamshid.<br> Up yours, too, pal.<br> Bloody English.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> - Hello there. How do you do?<br> - Nicholas. I'm so happy you came.<br> - So am I.<br> - Please. Please, this way.<br> I want to introduce you<br> to my wives. Excuse me.<br> This is Malyamu. She is my first wife.<br> She has given me five children.<br> Hello.<br> And this one, Nora. She has given me three.<br> Hi there.<br> And that here is Kay.<br> - Yes. This is Dr Nicholas Garrigan.<br> - Hello.<br> - He saved my life.<br> - Really, I just stitched his hand up.<br> - Don't be so modest.<br> - It is you I have to thank for the T-shirt.<br> Right. So you must be Campbell's mother?<br> - Yes.<br> - It's a pleasure meeting you.<br> Come. I have to introduce you<br> to some people.<br> Excuse me.<br> This is British High Commissioner<br> Mr Perkins.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Meet my good friend Dr Nicholas Garrigan.<br> - And his colleague Mr Stone.<br> - How do you do?<br> Yes, we've already met.<br> - I will talk with you later.<br> - Right.<br> We've been hearing<br> all sorts of things about you.<br> Yes, I gather the president<br> has clasped you to his bosom.<br> - No, no. Not exactly.<br> - What do you make of him?<br> I think he's doing<br> rather a great job. Don't you?<br> Yes. There's issues to be sorted out,<br> but, no, he plays a pretty straight bat.<br> Yes, definitely one of us.<br> Anyway, it's very good<br> to have another Englishman around.<br> - Scot.<br> - What?<br> I'm a Scotsman.<br> Ladies and gentlemen.<br> Friends, I am speaking with you now<br> because if I wait until later,<br> you will be too drunk to hear my voice.<br> Here is where civilisation began.<br> Here in Africa.<br> Here is where the Greeks<br> stole their philosophy<br> and the Arabs took their medicine.<br> We Ugandans<br> must be more proud of this history.<br> We are an independent African nation,<br> living in peace and economic power.<br> - Black power.<br> - Yes.<br> Just like all you people<br> thought would never be possible.<br> And now we will go through to dinner.<br> The food tonight, it is all local,<br> special food.<br> And none of it is human flesh.<br> This is my last.<br> Dr Garrigan, please come quickly.<br> The president is very sick.<br> They have poisoned me.<br> They are trying to assassinate me.<br> Nicholas.<br> I just have to examine your stomach.<br> Obote's people are everywhere.<br> They want me dead, Nicholas.<br> OK, I just need to do this. OK?<br> One more, one more.<br> OK. OK. OK.<br> OK, I think I know what this is.<br> Let me listen, just listen.<br> OK. Yeah. OK.<br> I think I know what this is. Bear with me.<br> There we are. OK?<br> I'm gonna ask you<br> to sit on this pouf right here.<br> What is this? What is this?<br> I'll just hold it against your stomach.<br> I'll ask you to stand up in three.<br> One, two, three.<br> Go.<br> I feel better, much better.<br> Yes, you are a good doctor. Thank you.<br> In future, remember<br> not to mix beer with aspirin.<br> - That was the cause?<br> - I think so. Yes.<br> I am ashamed that you saw me like that.<br> I was frightened.<br> I'm a doctor. Everything that passes<br> between us is confidential.<br> OK? I've taken an oath.<br> But a man who shows fear,<br> he is weak and he is a slave.<br> Well, if you're afraid of dying,<br> it shows you have a life worth keeping.<br> You see? You are a doctor,<br> and also a philosopher.<br> Yes. I do have a good life now.<br> Please. Please, sit.<br> Sit here.<br> I come from a very poor family.<br> I think you should know this.<br> My father, he left me when I was a child.<br> The British army, it became my home.<br> They took me as a cleaner in the kitchen,<br> cleaning pots.<br> They used to beat me.<br> "Build this wall, Amin."<br> "Dig this latrine, Amin."<br> And now, here I am,<br> the President of Uganda.<br> And who put me here?<br> It was the British.<br> What a story.<br> - Good night, Nicholas.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> - Hello. Sarah, it's Nicholas.<br> - Nicholas, where are you?<br> I'm still in Kampala, actually.<br> Thank you.<br> The president's offered me ajob.<br> Normally, I wouldn't even consider it,<br> but, under the circumstances,<br> I thought it might be quite a good idea.<br> I see.<br> - David will be disappointed.<br> - Well, I'll write to David, of course I will.<br> Of course.<br> I just hope you can do as much good there<br> as you could've done here.<br> Look, somebody's calling me. I'd better go.<br> Sure.<br> All right. Listen, bye, Sarah. I'll be in touch.<br> Bye.<br> When you're not treating the president or his<br> family, the hospital could use your expertise.<br> This is one of our new medical wards.<br> Further down the corridor are the operating<br> theatres, which the president has paid for.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Hi, Doctor.<br> Welcome to Mulago. Dr...?<br> Garrigan. Hello.<br> I do hope you find the hospital<br> up to the standard you're used to.<br> Excuse me. Who was that?<br> Your predecessor Dr Junju.<br> - Never mind him.<br> - Excuse me, sir.<br> He's here.<br> - Excuse me a moment.<br> - Of course.<br> - Hello.<br> - Jolly nice to meet you.<br> Dr Garrigan.<br> Just topping up on quinine.<br> - So, you decided to stay?<br> - Yes, I did.<br> Excellent. I just wanted to say that if there's<br> anything we can possibly help you with,<br> please don't hesitate.<br> What? You're my new best friend now?<br> Do just stay in touch.<br> Why?<br> Well, given that we were<br> so intimately involved<br> with the President coming to power,<br> the foreign office has asked me<br> to point out our awareness<br> of your very unique personal relationship<br> with President Amin.<br> Should you find the need to clarify your<br> status regarding details of that relationship,<br> we would of course welcome any clarification<br> you might feel the need to share with us.<br> Is there some special school<br> where you people learn to talk that bollocks?<br> Do, please, stay in touch.<br> You take care now.<br> This man is going to kill the president.<br> So Nicholas walks up to that cow<br> and he shoots it in the head.<br> On your marks. Get set.<br> Go!<br> Amin. Amin.<br> I won.<br> - OK. Here, Nicholas.<br> - No, no, no.<br> - Before I forget, I need to ask a favour.<br> - Anything.<br> I will be in Libya next week, and I need you<br> to attend a meeting in my place.<br> - What kind of meeting?<br> - A simple matter of taste and common sense.<br> I cannot think of anyone better than you.<br> Gentlemen. Please, don't get up.<br> The president sends his apologies.<br> He's been called away at short notice<br> and he's asked me to step in.<br> - And you are?<br> - Nicholas Garrigan. His doctor.<br> - His doctor?<br> - Yes.<br> - And you are?<br> - I'm the Austrian foreign minister.<br> This is Dr Rommel,<br> one of our leading architects,<br> and Dr Bruner<br> from the institute of civil engineering.<br> Together, we are the first bid.<br> Bid, right.<br> For what, precisely?<br> I love it.<br> Good choice. Modern, elegant.<br> A symbol of Uganda's future.<br> Here is where we will have<br> the next Pan-African Congress.<br> - Nice.<br> - My two closest advisers.<br> Tweedledum and Tweedledee.<br> - Look what Nicholas has designed for me.<br> - Nice.<br> - I didn't design anything. It was...<br> - Nonsense.<br> You have a wonderful eye.<br> Jonah, he has no taste.<br> Look at him.<br> Even his suits, they look silly.<br> Is that not right, Jonah?<br> - What is it you want, Jonah?<br> - I have ministerial papers for your signature.<br> Go. I will sign them later.<br> I do not like the way that man looks at me.<br> - Do you think he looks at me strangely?<br> - No.<br> No, I can't say that I've noticed.<br> OK, enlargement of the mediastinum<br> and reticulonodular lung patterns<br> all indicating pulmonary TB.<br> Yeah, but it could be...<br> What was that?<br> Makindye prison,<br> where Obote's people are being held.<br> Can you hear that?<br> Dr Garrigan. Dr Garrigan.<br> Please come quickly.<br> The president's son is sick.<br> What's wrong with him?<br> What's wrong with him?<br> Can you hear me, child?<br> I'm begging you to stop it, Mackenzie.<br> - OK. Thank you. You can step away.<br> - Stop it, Mackenzie, please.<br> - Hi. Your son's epileptic?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What? Has he been like this before, then?<br> - Yes.<br> Right, OK. Can you hold his knees up<br> against his chest? The other hand back here.<br> - This is Campbell?<br> - This is Mackenzie.<br> Mackenzie. Right.<br> Mackenzie, I am Dr Garrigan, OK?<br> We're gonna sort you out.<br> We'll get you to hospital.<br> No, no. The president will not allow it.<br> You must do what you can do from here.<br> - The child has to go to hospital.<br> - Please.<br> Please.<br> It's OK. Mamma's here.<br> Mamma's here. It's OK. Mamma's here.<br> OK. OK.<br> There you are. OK.<br> - There we are.<br> - Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.<br> I thought I was losing him.<br> It's OK. He's gonna be fine.<br> Could you move the toys<br> from that bed, please?<br> Could you move the toys<br> from that bed, please?<br> Big boy.<br> Big boy. Here we go.<br> - OK, baby. I'm so sorry. Sorry.<br> - It's OK. Don't say sorry.<br> Don't say sorry.<br> - So this is where you live?<br> - Yes.<br> Why not stay with the other wives?<br> Since I had Mackenzie, my husband<br> prefers us to be somewhere more private.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> I think your child has epilepsy.<br> It's a perfectly treatable condition.<br> - The president does visit you here?<br> - He visits the children, not me.<br> I'm a bad omen.<br> OK.<br> I'm gonna make an appointment<br> for Mackenzie at the hospital. All right?<br> I will tell the president<br> how helpful you have been.<br> Morning, Nicholas.<br> I could not go<br> without thanking you for helping my son.<br> - Don't mention it.<br> - I bring you a small gift.<br> No doctor should be without his ambulance.<br> - For me?<br> - Yes, come, come. This is yours here.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Are you serious? It's a fantastic gift.<br> Are you happy now? Let's try it. Drive me to<br> the airport. I have to fly to Libya on business.<br> - Don't you think I should get dressed?<br> - Quickly. Quickly.<br> - Now?<br> - Yes.<br> I'll just be a minute.<br> - Are you comfortable here?<br> - Very much, thank you.<br> So it was Obote's men<br> who attacked the prison, yeah?<br> - Yes.<br> - Right.<br> We heard the gunfire<br> all the way at the hospital.<br> - Yes. My soldiers, they held them off.<br> - We thought there'd be lots of casualties.<br> Do you want to drive your car? I want<br> to see you drive your car. Please. Come.<br> - Come.<br> - OK.<br> So, you do not like the way I treat my son.<br> No. No, I don't.<br> Hiding him away like that, it's ruining his life.<br> - That boy has everything he wants.<br> - Except the treatment that could save him.<br> He has comfort, a luxury life.<br> Money, sir, is no substitute for anything.<br> Nicholas, you have never been poor.<br> What about Kay? Don't you think...?<br> Do not speak about things<br> you do not understand.<br> But the way you are concerned,<br> it has touched me<br> and I will consider.<br> You know, I like this type<br> of frank conversation.<br> Yes, I respect your honesty<br> and your opinion completely.<br> Drive. Drive.<br> Drive past. Drive.<br> Drive.<br> Obote's men. I'm sure of it.<br> If I had not been in your car...<br> It is in my dream. They cannot kill me.<br> It is in my dream.<br> Somebody told his men my travel plans.<br> Somebody has betrayed me.<br> I cannot trust anybody.<br> I'm surrounded by traitors.<br> Masanga.<br> Nicholas. Nicholas.<br> You know Masanga.<br> He is one of my people.<br> He will handle<br> all of my security matters from now on.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - You will take care of me and this country.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Where is Jonah Wasswa?<br> Where is he? I need my minister.<br> A minister should be by his president's side.<br> - Where is he?<br> - I don't know.<br> And you call yourself my closest adviser.<br> You see? You see? These loyal soldiers,<br> already they have captured the criminals.<br> Do not pity them, Nicholas.<br> These men here, they wanted you dead.<br> Why did you try to kill me?<br> I will not die until I say.<br> Look at me.<br> You work for him. Obote.<br> That drunk, silly man.<br> You want to kill me for that drunk, silly man?<br> Uganda loves me<br> because I am loyal<br> and I am fair.<br> I am your president.<br> Come, Nicholas. This is no place for us.<br> These, I can read you later. And the rest,<br> that's just pro forma papers for you to sign.<br> I've left a small list of medical equipment<br> at the end for my old surgery in Mogambo.<br> Is there anything else, Nicholas?<br> Nicholas.<br> It's probably nothing, sir.<br> What?<br> Nicholas,<br> you are my closest adviser.<br> Please, tell me what is on your mind.<br> Last night, I went to the Holiday Inn<br> and had a drink.<br> And I saw Jonah Wasswa there<br> speaking to some white guy in the bar.<br> Something about it just didn't seem right.<br> It's probably nothing,<br> but you might wanna have a talk with him.<br> Just a talk.<br> Like I say, it's probably nothing.<br> Good night, sir.<br> - How are you?<br> - Very well. How are you?<br> I'm very well.<br> That is very good, Mackenzie.<br> - Very good. Go show your brother.<br> - OK.<br> Hiya.<br> Hi, ya.<br> He's looking much better.<br> Much better.<br> That other one is Campbell.<br> He is the one who got your T-shirt.<br> You're a man of taste.<br> Mummy. Mummy.<br> - Please. Goodbye.<br> - OK.<br> - He keeps pushing me, Mummy.<br> - OK, stop it.<br> Stop it, Mackenzie.<br> Garrigan.<br> - Daydreaming?<br> - Looking at you, Stone, I hope so.<br> I thought you'd be with the president<br> on his trip to London.<br> - No. I'm needed here.<br> - I do hope the man hasn't blown up again.<br> - What?<br> - I was reading this article in the Times.<br> I don't know if you've seen it. It seems ajudge<br> who ruled against Amin has gone missing.<br> - He hasn't been seen for five days.<br> - I'm sure there's a logical explanation.<br> The thing is, we've been getting reports<br> up and down the country of the same thing -<br> people speaking out against the regime<br> just disappearing.<br> No. If you're gonna accuse the president,<br> just come out and say it.<br> I was just hoping you might be able to<br> give us a little clarification.<br> Fuck your clarifications, Stone. Fuck them.<br> You people amaze me, you know.<br> The first sign of an independent leader<br> achieving something, what do you do?<br> You spit your dummy because you can't<br> stand the idea that he's done it without you.<br> I know he's a bit rough,<br> but what do you expect?<br> Do you think Obote's people<br> are sitting around waiting for clarifications?<br> Look at me.<br> This is Africa.<br> You meet violence with violence.<br> Anything else and you're dead.<br> Then perhaps you'd be so kind<br> as to explain to me<br> the whereabouts of Health Minister Wasswa.<br> What?<br> Well, he's missing, too.<br> But, as you say, I'm sure<br> there's some perfectly normal explanation.<br> I'm having drinks later<br> with the man who wrote the article.<br> Perhaps you'd like to join us,<br> shed some light on the matter.<br> - Fine. I will.<br> - About six o'clockish?<br> - Can I help?<br> - I need to see the minister.<br> I'm afraid she's busy.<br> You were right.<br> The health minister has gone missing.<br> - Apparently, he's fled to Tanzania.<br> - What? Jonah Wasswa?<br> He's embezzled several<br> hundred thousand pounds of ministry funds.<br> Some people are suggesting<br> that he's joined up with Obote's exiles.<br> - I find that very hard to believe.<br> - He was sealing a major pharmaceutical deal.<br> Life-saving penicillin for the masses.<br> I should know. I set up the meeting<br> with his South African counterpart<br> at the Holiday Inn.<br> So, this embezzlement,<br> is it on the record?<br> - Yes. Yes, it is.<br> - And I can quote you in the paper?<br> - I'm sorry, quote me?<br> - Not directly, of course.<br> As a government spokesman.<br> Government spokesman?<br> OK.<br> Mr President.<br> I've come to say goodbye.<br> I'm going home.<br> Mr President.<br> I got you. I got him.<br> Nicholas, meet my body double, Muyenga.<br> Look at him. Everything the same, except...<br> What do you say, Nicholas?<br> Is he as handsome as me?<br> - No. No he's not.<br> - You see?<br> You see? Nicholas agrees.<br> You are much more ugly than me, Muyenga.<br> Look. Look, Nicholas. I have others also.<br> All part of Captain Masanga's plan<br> for my security.<br> - Clever.<br> - Yep.<br> Nicholas.<br> My Nicholas.<br> What is all this about your going home?<br> You once told me that you respected me<br> because I wasn't afraid to speak my mind.<br> Speak.<br> It's this business with Wasswa.<br> I can't.<br> It fucking stinks. I can't help going back to<br> that moment when I asked you to talk to him.<br> This isn't me.<br> I have to go home now.<br> You cannot.<br> - What?<br> - Your work is not finished here yet.<br> But I didn't come here to finish anything.<br> You promised to me<br> that you would help to build a new Uganda.<br> You swore an oath.<br> The oath is a doctor's oath of confidentiality.<br> We all take it.<br> - It's got nothing to do with Uganda.<br> - Nothing?<br> Nothing comes from nothing.<br> You have a conscience. I know you do.<br> That is why you came here in the first place.<br> Or are you like all the other British?<br> Just here to fuck and to take away?<br> No.<br> No.<br> Why else would I trust you with my family?<br> You are like my own son.<br> I'm Nicholas Garrigan.<br> And I'm from Scotland.<br> It's my home. I want to...<br> Your home is here.<br> Please. Just... Please.<br> Do not be a silly boy.<br> If you go now, what will they think<br> about you and Jonah Wasswa?<br> What are you talking about? I said talk to him.<br> Do not pretend to yourself<br> that you did not know.<br> You are a stronger man than that.<br> I didn't want him to die, though.<br> But you did it.<br> Why? You want to know why?<br> You did it<br> because you love me.<br> You have stepped<br> deep into the heart of my country.<br> Uganda.<br> Uganda embraces you.<br> Nicholas.<br> Nicholas.<br> What you need is to have some fun.<br> Hey, Nicholas. Where have you been?<br> I want you to meet Betty.<br> And this here is her sister Joy.<br> Joy is going to look after you this weekend.<br> Joy.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> And now, let the games begin.<br> Nicholas, you didn't know<br> we had Ugandan cowboys.<br> Finance minister.<br> Come here.<br> Can I have another whisky, please?<br> Let me tell you, Nicholas,<br> you've chosen a fine life.<br> You want to kill me for that drunk, silly man?<br> Nicholas.<br> Nicholas.<br> Dr Garrigan.<br> Jesus fucking Christ, you look so lovely.<br> You know something? I shouldn't be here.<br> I should be in Scotland with my dad.<br> I should be looking after little old ladies<br> cos here I've fucked up.<br> Kay, I fucked up. I fucked up.<br> Not here.<br> - Walk with me.<br> - What?<br> Walk with me.<br> I'm fucking doomed.<br> Do you know he's got<br> go-go dancers after me now?<br> Where are we going?<br> I don't know.<br> - Nicky.<br> - Shit. It's the go-go dancer.<br> Through here. Come on.<br> Just follow me.<br> Fuck it.<br> He has always been like this.<br> He just chose not to show you until now.<br> Nicholas.<br> You have to find a way to get out.<br> He still listens to me.<br> He cannot trust anybody any more.<br> I'll wait, until things get really bad.<br> They are.<br> Really bad.<br> - Nothing.<br> - What?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What?<br> I just had this mad image of me and you<br> sitting at my mother and father's dinner table.<br> "More stew, Mrs Amin?"<br> Nicholas.<br> You've got to get out.<br> - What is going on?<br> - I don't know.<br> What if somebody saw us?<br> - Just wait two minutes and then come out.<br> - Yeah.<br> Go. Go, go, go.<br> Shit.<br> Dr Garrigan.<br> It's four in the morning.<br> Can I have a word with you?<br> - Whisky?<br> - OK.<br> They've...<br> they've taken my passport.<br> You were saying that<br> if there was ever anything you could do.<br> I need to get out of here while I still can.<br> I was hoping<br> you might be able to help in that.<br> - Please.<br> - "Please." That's a nice touch.<br> Have you any idea<br> what's going on in this country, Dr Garrigan?<br> Some.<br> In the countryside,<br> they're not even bothering to dig graves.<br> They're simply feeding them<br> to the crocodiles.<br> Right here in Kampala, right under our noses,<br> he's wiped out the entire political opposition.<br> Thousands of Acholi and Langi tribesmen<br> from the army.<br> He's hardly even bothering<br> to cover it up any more.<br> Even members of his own cabinet.<br> Your friend, the health minister.<br> This is a man who was actually<br> trying to help his country.<br> Idi always seems to get it wrong, doesn't he?<br> Jesus fucking Christ.<br> Get me out of here.<br> You earn your passage first.<br> What?<br> You know what they're calling you?<br> His white monkey.<br> I'm his doctor.<br> - It's not my job to judge the man.<br> - "I'm his doctor."<br> Is that your defence?<br> How pathetic. Fuck off, Garrigan.<br> We don't just hand out passports<br> to chimps like you.<br> Particularly not chimps<br> with blood on their hands.<br> Look, you, I'm a citizen and I have rights.<br> Fuck your rights.<br> You do as I say or you don't get out of here.<br> You're his doctor.<br> You have unprecedented access to him.<br> Obviously, we'd help you with...<br> anything you needed.<br> You want me to kill him?<br> Amidst rumours of human-rights violations<br> and mismanagement,<br> the situation in Uganda<br> has deteriorated badly in recent months.<br> ...ten new hospitals has had to be<br> deferred and all the rest of those...<br> Getting any definite information<br> from the country has become harder.<br> ...has accused the British<br> of attempting to assassinate him.<br> ...and so his policies<br> are growing ever more unpredictable.<br> The British government<br> has broken its promises to Uganda.<br> Because of this, I have decided<br> to expel all Asians from this country.<br> And these people, they are leeches.<br> They milk the cow,<br> but they do not want to feed the cow.<br> No longer. They have 90 days to leave.<br> They are too sick to leave.<br> Take your hands off him.<br> This is a sick man. How dare you?<br> I don't care where you get your orders from.<br> You cannot come into a hospital...<br> They're forcing our sick relatives to leave.<br> This is a hospital.<br> You get your men out of here now.<br> I'm complaining personally to the president.<br> You all right?<br> I'll see to this.<br> You're trying to help your people,<br> I understand that, but Uganda isn't ready, sir.<br> You expel the Asians now,<br> this economy will be on its knees,<br> not to mention the damage you'll do<br> to your reputation abroad.<br> Is that what you came here for?<br> To plead for your fucking Asian tailor?<br> These things do not concern you.<br> You are nothing but a doctor.<br> You are a nobody.<br> Get out.<br> Get out.<br> Sarah.<br> Sarah.<br> Hello.<br> - What have we done?<br> - Who...? Kay, is that you?<br> He is going to kill us, Nicholas.<br> He is going to kill us.<br> I have to get it out of me.<br> He will kill me, Nicholas.<br> I have to get it out.<br> - What are we going to do?<br> - I don't know.<br> I want you to do it. Please.<br> You're a doctor. I know you can do it.<br> - I know you can do it, Nicholas.<br> - No, we can't.<br> I can't do that.<br> This isn't some simple procedure.<br> It has to be done under clinical conditions.<br> I have to...<br> If you don't do something now,<br> I'm going to have to find a place to go.<br> I'll have to get it done in one of the villages.<br> Is that what you want?<br> No, you don't.<br> Come here. Whatever you do,<br> you don't do that. All right?<br> I'm gonna sort something out.<br> Promise me you'll stay in the house.<br> Please promise me you'll stay in the house.<br> Promise me this...<br> promise this is going to be all right.<br> I promise.<br> We'll do it first thing in the morning.<br> Kay Amin?<br> - The president's wife?<br> - Yes.<br> - No. We couldn't do that here, not at Mulago.<br> - Why not?<br> It's the president's hospital.<br> He's bound to find out.<br> - We could do this discreetly.<br> - No.<br> He would kill her and us.<br> - It's too much to risk.<br> - What choice does she have?<br> Some backstreet job in a village somewhere?<br> Come on, Thomas.<br> You know what that means.<br> It's the only choice you've left her.<br> But I don't expect<br> it crossed your mind to wonder.<br> A white man with a black woman.<br> What does she need with such things?<br> Fine.<br> I'll do it myself.<br> The president wants to see you. Now.<br> My head is exploding.<br> I can't think. I can't sleep.<br> Look at this. Look at this.<br> The British newspapers say I am a madman.<br> The American newspapers<br> say I am a cannibal.<br> I am a cannibal?<br> These are lies.<br> I should throw them out for good.<br> Only Ugandan press from now on.<br> - You want something for the headache?<br> - No.<br> - Something to help you sleep, perhaps?<br> - Later. I want you to tell me what to do.<br> - You want me to tell you what to do?<br> - Yes. You are my adviser.<br> You are the only one I can trust in here.<br> You should've told me<br> not to throw the Asians out in the first place.<br> - I did.<br> - But you did not persuade me, Nicholas.<br> You did not persuade me.<br> Tell me what to do here.<br> Don't throw the journalists out.<br> They're only gonna write more lies about you.<br> You invite them to meet you face to face.<br> You charm them.<br> You show them what kind of a man you are.<br> You think this will work?<br> I think that's the Amin they need to see.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much, Nicholas.<br> What would I do without my Nicholas?<br> What would I do without my Nicholas?<br> Is there something going on here?<br> No. No.<br> No.<br> - Is there?<br> - No.<br> No.<br> - Are you sure, Nicholas?<br> - Yes.<br> Yes.<br> Give me a booster,<br> something to make me feel strong again.<br> Sir.<br> - Where are you going, Nicholas?<br> - I have something that I have to attend to.<br> No.<br> You have to stay here.<br> I need you for the press conference.<br> This is all very well, your Excellency,<br> but what about the reports of mass killings?<br> Who have you been talking with?<br> The British?<br> Go. Look around Uganda for missing people.<br> Go anywhere you please.<br> So, why would the British<br> spread these rumours?<br> Because they hate me.<br> Because I refuse to recognise South Africa,<br> a racist regime that they support.<br> - Also, they are jealous of me.<br> - Why?<br> Because while they are starving<br> with their strikes and with their protests,<br> the people of Uganda<br> are eating beef and driving big cars.<br> I have created the Save Britain Fund.<br> We Ugandans, we like to help friends,<br> so the Ugandans have got together<br> and saved three tons of food and vegetables<br> for their friends in England.<br> Because they are having<br> economic difficulties, let me assure you here.<br> Kay.<br> Kay.<br> Kay, it's OK. It's Nick.<br> - What?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> She went to the village.<br> They had to take her to hospital.<br> It's been reported that you crowned yourself<br> the last king of Scotland.<br> My good friends the Scottish people have<br> seen how I have defeated the English here<br> and they want me<br> to do the same for them there.<br> Yeah. This woman here.<br> Did you write to the queen of England,<br> offering yourself as a lover?<br> You are very cheeky.<br> And this is what happens<br> when you betray the president.<br> This is what happens when you betray him.<br> I'm not. I enjoy it.<br> I could spend the rest of my life getting laid.<br> There should be more to it<br> than a lot of little tingles.<br> They say she has a clitoris<br> halfway down her throat.<br> Is this possible?<br> Medically?<br> Almost all aberrations of nature are possible.<br> I made an example of her<br> because she betrayed me.<br> I brought you those headache pills<br> that you asked for.<br> Good.<br> Is there anything else?<br> No. No, that's all.<br> Then go.<br> We are busy here.<br> Morning.<br> Come on.<br> - Shit.<br> - Hello? Yes.<br> Come on.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Nicholas, there you are.<br> Were you trying to run away from me?<br> No. No.<br> I need you at the airport right away<br> to help me with the hostages.<br> - Hostages?<br> - Yes.<br> An Air France aeroplane has been hijacked<br> by our Palestinian brothers.<br> They have landed here at Entebbe.<br> The eyes of the world are on Uganda today.<br> Come, Nicholas. To work.<br> How many passengers?<br> How many of them are Zionist?<br> And television - plenty of television cameras.<br> Please, tell them to take the hostages<br> to the terminal building.<br> Mr President, the press is waiting for you, sir.<br> I wanted to assure you that the hostages<br> will get the best medical care.<br> I have made my own doctor available.<br> Doctor. Doctor, what's the situation here?<br> One woman with a heart condition<br> has gone to hospital, cases of shock,<br> and we're giving malaria pills to everyone.<br> - Who's not been seen by a doctor?<br> - We haven't.<br> OK, how many of you are there?<br> - Yourself?
