For each.<br> And another 500<br> when we get the job done.<br> How many other genuine heroes<br> you got lined up?<br> Whiskey.<br> So who will we be training<br> your boys to fight?<br> His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.<br> He was once the Emperor's teacher.<br> -He's Samurai.<br> -Samurai?<br> The word you might use is ''warrior.''<br> Mr. Omura is familiar with our experiences<br> dealing with renegades.<br> ls he?<br> He's even read your book.<br> Captain Algren's study of the tribes...<br> ...was a crucial factor<br> in our defeat of the Cheyenne.<br> Please excuse. What is funny?<br> The corps back together again.<br> lt's just so...<br> ...inspiring!<br> Excuse me.<br> l need to use the necessities.<br> This isn't a problem.<br> l'll just talk to him for a minute.<br> Colonel Bagley.<br> We contacted you because you are<br> Captain Algren's superior officer...<br> ...and you assured us<br> of his participation.<br> He'll do it.<br> l just need a minute.<br> Nathan.<br> l did what l was ordered<br> to do out there.<br> And l have no remorse.<br> So, what do you say we<br> put the past behind us?<br> -You want me to kill Jappos, l'll kill them.<br> -l'm not asking you to kill anybody.<br> You want me to kill the enemies of Jappos,<br> l'll kill their enemies.<br> Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne....<br> For 500 bucks a month,<br> l'll kill whoever you want.<br> But keep one thing in mind...<br> ...l'd happily kill you for free.<br> July 1 2th, 1 87 6.<br> There is some comfort<br> in the emptiness of the sea.<br> No past, no future.<br> And then at once, I am confronted<br> by the hard truth of present circumstances.<br> I have been hired to help suppress<br> the rebellion of yet another tribal leader.<br> Apparently, this is the only job<br> for which I am suited.<br> I am beset by the ironies of my life.<br> -Captain Algren, l presume?<br> -Yes.<br> Jolly good. How do you do?<br> Simon Graham.<br> Twenty years ago,<br> this was a sleepy little town.<br> Now look at it.<br> You see, the Emperor is mad<br> for all things Western...<br> ...and the Samurai believe<br> it's changing too fast.<br> The ancient and the modern<br> are at war for the soul of Japan.<br> So your new employer, Mr. Omura,<br> is bringing in...<br> ...every Western expert he can get.<br> Lawyers from France, engineers from<br> Germany, architects from Holland...<br> ...and now, of course,<br> warriors from America.<br> l came over with the British<br> trade mission, oh, years ago.<br> l was soon relieved of my position.<br> l had an unfortunate tendency<br> to tell the truth...<br> ...in a country where no one ever<br> says what they mean.<br> So now, l very accurately translate<br> other people's lies.<br> For 2000 years, no emperor<br> was even seen by a commoner.<br> You have to realize what an honor this is.<br> lt's all highly ritualized, of course.<br> You may look at him,<br> but do not speak unless spoken to.<br> lf he stands, you must bow.<br> lf he bows, you must bow lower.<br> Do l look presentable?<br> l haven't worn this in a decade.<br> Rather snug around the midriff.<br> And bow.<br> The divine Emperor Meiji<br> bids you welcome.<br> He is grateful for the assistance<br> your country offers.<br> We hope to accomplish the same national<br> harmony you enjoy in your homeland.<br> The Emperor is most interested<br> in your American lndians...<br> ...if you have fought<br> against them in battle.<br> We have, Your Highness.<br> The red man is a brutal adversary.<br> The Emperor wishes<br> to ask Captain Algren...<br> ...if it is true they wear eagle feathers...<br> ...and paint their faces<br> before going into battle...<br> ...and that they have no fear.<br> They are very brave.<br> Bow.<br> Thank you very much.<br> And step back.<br> Step back, step back and turn.<br> Right, you little bastards!<br> You will stand up straight<br> or l will personally shit-kick...<br> ...every Far Eastern buttock<br> that appears before my eyes!<br> Well done, sergeant.<br> When you understand the language,<br> everything falls into place.<br> The first rank will kneel,<br> rifles at the ready.<br> The second rank....<br> July 22nd, 1 87 6.<br> For six months' work, I am to receive<br> three years of captain's pay...<br> ...teaching Orientals to soldier.<br> They are an army of conscripts.<br> Most of them are peasants<br> who have never even seen a gun.<br> Fire!<br> They are led by General Hasegawa,<br> a man of small stature...<br> ...who nonetheless commands<br> enormous respect.<br> What can the general tell me about<br> this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?<br> He seems to have great knowledge<br> of Katsumoto and his rebellion.<br> I will count on his help<br> when facing the Samurai.<br> Who supplies their weapons?<br> Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself<br> by using firearms, you see.<br> He uses no firearms?<br> To those who honor the old ways,<br> Katsumoto is a hero.<br> How well does he know him?<br> The general and Katsumoto<br> fought together for the Emperor.<br> He fought with the Samurai?<br> He is Samurai.<br> You must understand. Katsumoto pledged<br> his sword to defend the Emperor.<br> They say that a Samurai's sword<br> is his soul.<br> Samurai are paradoxical. l've tried to write<br> about them, but they keep to themselves.<br> The bastards are still wearing armor.<br> When the lrish were comporting<br> themselves in loincloths...<br> ...these chaps were the most<br> sophisticated warriors on Earth.<br> l need information<br> on their battle tactics.<br> l have several more books<br> just waiting to be translated.<br> He'll be speaking the lingo in no time.<br> You should hear him blather on in Blackfoot.<br> Really?<br> A fellow linguist? Oh, capital!<br> Come on, sir.<br> A word or two in the savage tongue.<br> Just ''hello'' or ''goodbye'' or--<br> No, no, no!<br> ''Cut his tongue out<br> and boil him in oil.''<br> Early day tomorrow, captain.<br> -lt's about bedtime, isn't it?<br> -l always had a fascination with scalping.<br> l never quite understood<br> its technique.<br> lmagine someone who hates you<br> with the utmost intensity...<br> ...grabbing a handful of your hair<br> while you're lying prostrate and helpless...<br> ...and scraping a dull blade<br> of a rusty knife around your scalp...<br> ...with a saw-like motion.<br> And let your imagination grasp, if you can,<br> the effect of a strong, quick jerk...<br> ...on the turf of your hair<br> to release any clinging particles...<br> ...would have on your nervous system.<br> And you'll have some idea<br> of how it feels to be scalped...<br> ...Mr. Graham.<br> How soon can you<br> translate those books?<br> Right away.<br> l'm just delighted you're taking<br> such an interest in Samurai.<br> l don't give a damn about the Samurai.<br> l want to know my enemy.<br> l shall not sleep until it is done.<br> Sake.<br> l bid you good night.<br> Can l get you anything?<br> This is a punitive expedition, captain.<br> Col. Bagley, these people had<br> nothing to do with the raids!<br> -Good night, sir.<br> -Quietly now, boys.<br> Fire!<br> We should be grateful they're all firing<br> in the same direction.<br> Couldn't have put it better myself, sir.<br> Rifle butt, against the shoulder.<br> Eye, down the sight.<br> Now, slowly....<br> Well done.<br> Nathan!<br> Katsumoto's attacked a railroad<br> at the border of his province.<br> We cannot govern a country<br> in which we cannot travel freely.<br> He must be stopped now.<br> My railroad is a priority<br> for this country.<br> They're not ready.<br> The rebels don't have any rifles.<br> They're savages with bows and arrows.<br> Whose sole occupation for the last<br> thousand years has been war.<br> You have superior firepower<br> and a larger force.<br> l am ordering the regiment<br> to move against Katsumoto.<br> You will track him down<br> and engage him.<br> Load.<br> Mr. Graham!<br> Tell this man to fire at me!<br> -l beg your pardon?<br> -Tell this man...<br> ...if he does not shoot me,<br> l will kill him!<br> -Captain, if l might have a word.<br> -Tell him!<br> Tell him!<br> Load!<br> Load!<br> Faster!<br> Faster!<br> Shoot me, damn it.<br> Fire!<br> Fire!<br> They're not ready.<br> The regiment leaves at 6 a.m.!<br> A thousand miles of rail track laid<br> in less than two years.<br> lt's astonishing.<br> And Omura owns all of it?<br> As soon as he can get rid<br> of the Samurai, he will, yes.<br> How do you intend<br> to find Katsumoto?<br> Don't worry, Mr. Graham.<br> l assure you, he'll find us.<br> Move into position!<br> form a battle line on me!<br> Pay attention,<br> it will save your life!<br> form on 1 st Company.<br> form up behind.<br> Fill in on command!<br> -Where's Hasegawa?<br> -He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.<br> -Cover down!<br> -Captain Algren.<br> We are not here as combatants.<br> -Then who's gonna lead them?<br> -Their own officers.<br> -Let's move to the rear.<br> -We'll be there presently.<br> Fix bayonets!<br> -Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear.<br> -Yes, of course.<br> Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see<br> to the disposition of the supply trains.<br> -Did you hear my order?<br> -l did indeed, sir!<br> Then you will obey it. Now!<br> No disrespect intended, sir,<br> but shove it up your ass.<br> -Load!<br> -Load!<br> Samurai come.<br> You'll be fine, son.<br> -Assume firing positions!<br> -Assume firing positions!<br> Fire on my order only!<br> Hold your fire!<br> Hold your fire!<br> Reload!<br> Hold the line!<br> Fire at will!<br> Lieutenant, fall back!<br> Zeb!<br> What is your name?<br> This is my son's village.<br> We are deep in the mountains<br> and winter is coming.

Algren-san.<br> Algren?<br> Algren, my God, you are alive.<br> Well, you never cease to astonish.<br> -Howitzers.<br> -Yes, indeed.<br> As soon as the Emperor signs<br> the trade agreement...<br> ...he gets the whole package.<br> lncluding this particular item.<br> Two hundred rounds a minute.<br> And the new cartridges<br> cut down on jamming.<br> l need a bath.<br> After living with those savages,<br> l can only imagine.<br> Welcome back, captain.<br> Gentlemen, come in.<br> Captain Algren, it seems you have<br> endured your captivity with little ill effect.<br> l was not ill-treated, sir.<br> Mr. Omura, l have here<br> a draft of the arms agreement.<br> l'm eager to know how many Samurai<br> have joined Katsumoto.<br> l'm afraid l don't know.<br> -You spent the winter at his encampment.<br> -As his prisoner.<br> Has he fortified his position?<br> Acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw.<br> As you said, colonel,<br> they're savages with bows and arrows.<br> -Sir, about the--<br> -l'm sure your documents are in order.<br> Thank you. Leave them on my desk.<br> l'll address them at the appropriate time.<br> With all due respect, sir,<br> our president's patience is wearing thin.<br> Perhaps there is someone else<br> we should speak to.<br> With all due respect, ambassador...<br> ...perhaps there is someone else<br> we should speak to.<br> For instance, the French<br> or the English.<br> Or any of the legations<br> waiting in the next room.<br> We should be looking forward<br> to hearing from you.<br> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<br> Captain Algren.<br> Perhaps you and l might have<br> a word in private. Please, sit down.<br> -May l offer you whiskey?<br> -No, thank you.<br> Katsumoto is an extraordinary man,<br> is he not?<br> He's a tribal leader.<br> l've known many of them.<br> But none who are Samurai.<br> Their ways have great appeal.<br> -l don't see how this concerns me.<br> -But it does.<br> You see, you were right. Last year,<br> we were not prepared to go to battle.<br> You were right,<br> and Colonel Bagley was wrong.<br> But now, we are ready.<br> lf Katsumoto is allowed to attract<br> other Samurai to his cause...<br> ...we will have 1 0 years of rebellion.<br> This is something l will not allow.<br> Either l'll stop him at the council today,<br> or you'll lead my army against him.<br> And with these new weapons,<br> you will crush him.<br> -l appreciate the offer.<br> -lt is not an offer.<br> Mr. Omura, my contract with you<br> was to train your army.<br> Then we will make a new contract...<br> ...one that will recognize the extraordinary<br> contribution you've made to the Emperor.<br> Do we understand each other?<br> -Yes, we understand each other perfectly.<br> -Then l am pleased.<br> Captain Algren!<br> What in heaven's name is going on?<br> The diplomatic community is abuzz.<br> Omura has passed laws<br> against the Samurai.<br> l need a drink.<br> ls your friend Katsumoto really planning<br> to go up against the council this afternoon?<br> My God, it's started.<br> Captain Algren!<br> Jolly good.<br> l heard you were leaving.<br> Omura offers you my job,<br> and you run away.<br> l suppose l should thank you.<br> $500 a month, including<br> back pay for time spent...<br> ...in captivity.<br> Enough to climb back inside a bottle<br> for the rest of your life.<br> You're welcome.<br> Well, it is pretty much over.<br> Katsumoto's under arrest.<br> Omura won't let him last the night.<br> With him dead, we should have<br> little trouble handling the rebellion...<br> ...even without you.<br> Especially without you.<br> Just tell me one thing.<br> What is it about your own people<br> that you hate so much?<br> Don't stop.<br> Whatever you do, don't stop.<br> -President of the United States?<br> -Sorry.<br> l think l'm going to be sick.<br> How's your poem coming?<br> The end is proving difficult.<br> This is Mr. Simon Graham. He'd like<br> very much to take your photograph.<br> l thought you returned to America.<br> l decided to stay.<br> See if l could convince you to escape.<br> How do you plan to do that?<br> Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care<br> to take pictures of my village.<br> l would be greatly honored.<br> The Emperor could not hear my words.<br> His army will come.<br> lt is the end.<br> For 900 years, my ancestors<br> have protected our people.<br> Now...<br> ...l have failed them.<br> So you will take your own life...<br> ...in shame?<br> Shame for a life of service?<br> Discipline? Compassion?<br> The way of the Samurai<br> is not necessary anymore.<br> Necessary?<br> What could be more necessary?<br> l will die by the sword.<br> My own...<br> ...or my enemy's.<br> Then let it be your enemy's.<br> Together, we will make<br> the Emperor hear you.<br> Algren.<br> l'd say two full regiments.<br> They'll come in waves of a thousand.<br> And they have the howitzers.<br> lt makes no difference. They will come,<br> and we will make our stand.<br> -How many men will we have?<br> -Maybe 500.<br> Like General Custer, huh?<br> There was once a battle<br> at a place called Thermopylae.<br> Three hundred brave Greeks held off<br> a Persian army of a million men.<br> A million. You understand this number?<br> l understand this number.<br> For two days the Greeks<br> made them pay so dearly...<br> ...the Persian army lost all taste<br> for battle and were defeated soon after.<br> -What do you have in mind?<br> -Take away the advantage of their guns.<br> They're overconfident. We'll use that.<br> Lure them close.<br> Close enough for a sword.<br> You believe...<br> ...a man can change his destiny?<br> l think a man does what he can...<br> ...until his destiny is revealed to him.<br> May 25th, 1 87 7.<br> This will be the last entry<br> in this journal.<br> I've tried to give a true accounting<br> of what I have seen, what I have done.<br> I do not presume to understand<br> the course of my life.<br> I know I am grateful<br> to have partaken of all this...<br> ...even if for a moment.<br> You will need this.<br> What does it say?<br> ''l belong to the warrior in whom<br> the old ways have joined the new.''<br> Good God.<br> Sir, the lmperial Army of Japan<br> demands your surrender.<br> lf you lay down your arms,<br> you will not be harmed.<br> This is not possible,<br> as Mr. Omura knows.<br> Captain Algren.<br> We will show you no quarter.<br> You ride against us,<br> and you are the same as them.<br> l'll look for you on the field.<br> Captain Algren.<br> Mr. Graham.<br> Perhaps you can use these<br> for your book.<br> Yes, l will. Captain.<br> Godspeed.<br> Mr. Graham.<br> Commence firing!<br> -They're covering their retreat.<br> -You see?<br> Even the mighty Samurai<br> cannot stand up to the howitzers.<br> -Signal the attack.<br> -l advise sending in skirmishers first.<br> Nonsense! Full attack!<br> They're coming.<br> Wait for the volley.<br> Second volley.<br> -What on earth?<br> -What is happening?<br> -The attack has been stopped.<br> -Send in the rest of the regiment.<br> What happened to the warriors<br> at Thermopylae?<br> Dead to the last man.<br> Algren-san!<br> Son of a bitch thinks he can win.<br> They'll bring two more regiments<br> up here soon.<br> We won't be able to stop them again.<br> You do not have to die here.<br> l should have died<br> so many times before.<br> Now, you live again.<br> Yes.<br> lt was not your time.<br> lt's not over.<br> What is this?<br> -This is madness. He's going to attack?<br> -Yes.<br> He's defeated!<br> He must accept his shame!<br> Kill him. All of them.<br> Now!<br> My horse!<br> Fire!<br> Ready!<br> Aim!<br> Fire!<br> Fire at will!<br> Backward!<br> No.<br> You have your honor again.<br> Let me die with mine.<br> Help me up.<br> Are you ready?<br> l will miss our conversations.<br> Perfect.<br> They are all...<br> ...perfect.<br> On behalf of the United States of America...<br> ...the signing of this treaty will usher in<br> an era of unprecedented prosperity...<br> ...and cooperation between<br> our two great nations.<br> On behalf of the Emperor...<br> ...we are pleased to have<br> successfully concluded this...<br> ...negotiation.<br> This is Katsumoto's sword.<br> He would have wanted you to have it...<br> ...that the strength of the Samurai<br> be with you always.<br> He hoped...<br> ...with his last breath...<br> ...that you would remember the ancestors<br> who held this sword...<br> ...and what they died for.<br> You were with him...<br> ...at the end?<br> Emperor, this man fought against you!<br> Your Highness...<br> ...if you believe me to be your enemy,<br> command me...<br> ...and l will gladly take my life.<br> l have dreamed of a unified Japan...<br> ...of a country strong<br> and independent and modern.<br> And now we have railroads<br> and cannon, Western clothing.<br> But...<br> ...we cannot forget who we are...<br> ...or where we come from.<br> Ambassador Swanbeck...<br> ...l have concluded that your treaty...<br> ...is not in the best interest of my people.<br> -Sir, if l may--<br> -So sorry...<br> ...but you may not.<br> This is an outrage!<br> Tell me how he died.<br> l will tell you how he lived.<br> And so the days<br> of the Samurai had ended.<br> Nations, like men, it is sometimes said,<br> have their own destiny.<br> As for the American captain...<br> ...no one knows what became of him.<br> Some say that he died of his wounds...<br> ...others, that he returned<br> to his own country.<br> But I like to think...<br> ...he may have at last found<br> some small measure of peace...<br> ...that we all seek...<br> ...and few of us ever find.<br> [ENGLlSH]<br>
