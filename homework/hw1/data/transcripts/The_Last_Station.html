                        Darling?<br> Oh, darling.<br> But sex.<br> You are 23.<br> Not an easy age<br> for abstinence, is it?<br> Tolstoy does not approve<br> of sexual relations.<br> - I know this.<br> - He despises them, in fact.<br> Well, I don't mean<br> to belabor the point...<br> ...but last summer<br> I arranged for a manservant...<br> ...who proceeded to ruin<br> two housemaids, just like that.<br> He was very upset.<br> This would not be a problem with me.<br> I'm a vegetarian.<br> I am celibate.<br> I'm also a vegetarian.<br> My dear boy, if you were to become<br> Tolstoy's private secretary...<br> ...you would be given<br> a great gift.<br> Vladimir Grigorevich, please know<br> that I understand what a privilege...<br> ...this position presents.<br> But since becoming a Tolstoyan,<br> I have become so eager to learn...<br> ...to discuss ideas,<br> to perfect my very soul.<br> Yes.<br> Well...<br> We have a lot to do if we are<br> to get his work to the people.<br> - We?<br> - Yes, we.<br> If we can encourage the spread<br> of passive resistance...<br> ...just think of it, Valentin.<br> Thousands of ordinary Russians...<br> ...casting off centuries of political<br> and spiritual oppression.<br> - In the name of truth and freedom.<br> - Truth and freedom. Yes, yes.<br> But, still,<br> there are many, many enemies.<br> - Enemies?<br> - Come.<br> The czar's police.<br> You will be followed<br> when you leave here...<br> ...and the Church will stop at nothing<br> to bring him back into the fold.<br> And then, of course,<br> there is the countess.<br> Her dogged attachment<br> to private property...<br> ...her public criticism<br> of our movement.<br> But the point is...<br> ...he needs a man of your<br> intellectual gifts around him.<br> Someone who<br> understands his goals.<br> And they still won't<br> let me see him.<br> They keep me under<br> house arrest.<br> I have another task<br> for you, my dear.<br> I want you to keep<br> a diary for me.<br> I need to know what goes<br> on at Yasnaya Polyana.<br> You let me know<br> who visits the house...<br> ...any talk of the copyright to his work,<br> any contact with the Church...<br> ...anything the countess says.<br> - Anything?<br> - She's very, very dangerous.<br> Godspeed, my boy.<br> And remember what I said.<br> Write everything down.<br> Driver!<br> Good morning, countess.<br> - Are you rolling?<br> - I am.<br> Countess?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> If my heart stopped beating,<br> I'd still go riding today.<br> Your pulse is my responsibility.<br> - No. It's mine.<br> - Fine.<br> If you must ride,<br> I insist you wear a coat.<br> - Even the sun is cold today.<br> - Oh, this!<br> This is impossible!<br> These people are parasites!<br> "The Countess Tolstoy<br> is estranged from her husband.<br> They barely speak. "<br> And they gossip<br> about us in Paris.<br> "They do not share a similar<br> view of religion or politics. "<br> You think that's inaccurate?<br> I think it's none<br> of the world's business.<br> What are you doing?<br> Why do you write down...<br> ...everything we say?<br> Don't do that.<br> Dushan Petrovich,<br> you are scribbling again.<br> Oh, Leovochka, why do you<br> insist on dressing like that?<br> - What do you mean, like what?<br> - Like the man who looks after sheep.<br> It wasn't meant to offend you.<br> You're a count,<br> for God's sake.<br> Darling, where are you going?<br> Riding with Sasha.<br> Don't expect us for lunch.<br> Lev Nikolayevich,<br> you've forgotten your coat.<br> Dushan, are you fretting?<br> Yes, because you refuse<br> to look after yourself.<br> Telyatinki was created<br> by Vladimir Grigorevich...<br> ...as a center for the movement.<br> We're all equals here, you know,<br> as Tolstoy teaches us.<br> This is a place of freedom.<br> It's a beautiful day.<br> Yes, but we'll pay for it.<br> Toolshed is there.<br> That's the meeting room,<br> and this is the dormitory.<br> I found it!<br> - Afternoon.<br> - Yes, hello.<br> You are expected at Yasnaya<br> Polyana in the morning...<br> ...first thing.<br> - First thing?<br> You'll need to be on the road early.<br> It's two hours away.<br> - I look forward to it.<br> - Yes. You're lucky.<br> We're all envious.<br> I'll see you in the morning.<br> If we're spared.<br> Right.<br> And out.<br> In.<br> Emma, can you come?<br> We need you in the house.<br> Come in.<br> - Brought you a glass of tea.<br> - That's very kind of you.<br> It's your first day.<br> Enjoy it.<br> You met Sergeyenko?<br> Last night, yes.<br> What do you think?<br> I thought he seemed very sincere.<br> Thank you.<br> What?<br> - Is that what you think?<br> - I think that...<br> I think I've just arrived.<br> What was your name?<br> Masha. But you should<br> still say what you think.<br> I mean, not just about him.<br> Like we all should.<br> Yes.<br> Excuse me.<br> Thank you for the tea.<br> He's a sorry, old, tight-assed<br> stick-in-the-mud...<br> ...but, yes, he's sincere.<br> Hello?<br> Out of the way.<br> Hello?<br> Excuse me.<br> You.<br> - You're the new secretary?<br> - Yes.<br> Valentin Fedorovich Bulgakov.<br> Papa is out.<br> You can wait upstairs in the library.<br> I am so glad you're here.<br> I'm so glad.<br> - God bless you.<br> - Pardon me. I'm mortified.<br> I sneeze sometimes<br> when I get nervous.<br> Yes.<br> Now, Vladimir Grigorevich has already<br> written about you at lengths.<br> I don't need that.<br> What I do need is your help.<br> My manifesto against the<br> government is hard work.<br> They commit their idiotic abuses<br> faster than I can catalog them.<br> Yes.<br> And then there's the new book,<br> the compendium.<br> Grigorevich told me all about it.<br> He says that you say that all the<br> world's religions share common truths.<br> - It's very exciting.<br> - No, one truth.<br> One single organizing principle.<br> And can you guess what that is?<br> Love.<br> Love.<br> Simple.<br> Yeah, but I want<br> to talk about you.<br> How are you?<br> And how was your journey?<br> Come, sit down.<br> I was born on that sofa.<br> No, no, sit, sit.<br> Myself, my brother,<br> my children...<br> ...five or six of them, at least.<br> Right here.<br> Congratulations.<br> Well, I've read your essays.<br> How's the work progressing?<br> My boy, what is it?<br> - Oh, I've upset you<br> in some way. - No.<br> Was it the sofa?<br> I mean, it's only a sofa.<br> The sofa's wonderful.<br> I...<br> I'm very happy.<br> You're very kind to me.<br> You see, I am no one...<br> ...and you are Lev Tolstoy.<br> And you ask me<br> about my work.<br> I'll fetch you a glass of tea.<br> - Yes.<br> - Now, you rest.<br> Yeah, because there's work<br> for both of us to do, together!<br> Yes.<br> God.<br> This machine, it really is<br> the most extraordinary thing.<br> Mama, these people<br> have nothing.<br> No, it's not for lack of land<br> that the muzhiks live in poverty.<br> It's because they have no<br> willpower and drink too much.<br> I am not suggesting<br> they be given land.<br> Private property is the<br> root of the problem.<br> - We should be giving ours away.<br> - God. Giving it to whom?<br> Yes, exactly.<br> I mean, this is ridiculous.<br> You think because the peasants<br> are poor, they're morally superior.<br> I believe that wealth<br> corrupts us all.<br> Yes, I do.<br> It's a keystone<br> of the movement.<br> Oh, God, I know all<br> about the movement.<br> If the peasants had money...<br> ...they wouldn't surround<br> themselves, as we do...<br> ...with footmen costing<br> No, they'd spend it<br> on drink and whores.<br> Valentin Fedorovich.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Tea.<br> You think that 50 years from now,<br> people will eat...<br> ...while grown men walk around<br> waiting on them hand and foot?<br> - I think...<br> - That's good.<br> - Bless you.<br> - Stop scribbling.<br> I mean, you all think he's<br> Christ, don't you?<br> - He thinks he's Christ.<br> - I'm not...<br> I don't believe Lev<br> Nikolayevich is Christ.<br> - Christ is Christ, but...<br> - But what?<br> I do believe he's<br> one of the prophets.<br> God speaks through him.<br> - I recognize the cadence in his voice.<br> - Oh, God, this is unbearable.<br> No wonder I feel lonely.<br> I'm surrounded by morons.<br> - Ma, you're being ridiculous.<br> - Oh, am I?<br> I have to sit here and listen to this<br> talk of love and God and equality...<br> ...knowing all the time,<br> full well...<br> ...that Count Generosity is about<br> to give away everything we own.<br> Now, why do you keep<br> going on about this?<br> Why do you think that we should profit<br> from the work I'm doing now?<br> Which is only meant for<br> the sake of the people.<br> Stop writing!<br> Stop writing now!<br> In defense of my gift,<br> please let me demonstrate.<br> It's quite remarkable, really.<br> In the same way now,<br> a society of hunger...<br> ...full of segregation...<br> I understand...<br> ...not only with my mind or heart...<br> - It's... It's your voice.<br> ...but with my soul<br> that the existence...<br> ...of tens of thousands...<br> - It's your voice.<br> It's wonderful.<br> It's wonderful!<br> It's tiresome.<br> Another remarkable invention<br> will supersede it.<br> Please excuse me.<br> No matter what all the learned<br> men in the world say...<br> Lev Nikolayevich is something<br> of a Luddite, I fear.<br> It is a crime.<br> And one committed not once,<br> but constantly.<br> I knew that I with my luxury...<br> That's better.<br> That's nice.<br> That's very nice indeed.<br> Do your parents often speak<br> to each other so bluntly?<br> Mama doesn't understand<br> my father's goals...<br> ...not since his work as a novelist<br> became secondary.<br> His commitment to the<br> spiritual life offends her.<br> They've fought about<br> it for years.<br> Well, I'm sure she<br> means well by it.<br> I see a fine young man before me.<br> Clear eyes, nice features...<br> ...rather handsome<br> in a peculiar sort of a way.<br> Thank you, countess.<br> Oh, please,<br> call me Sofya Andreyevna.<br> We don't stand on formality here,<br> as you may have noticed.<br> No, no. So many young<br> men nowadays...<br> ...spoil their good looks<br> with loose living, but you...<br> ...you're a real Tolstoyan,<br> I can tell that.<br> Well, thank you. I have to say,<br> I admire your husband immensely.<br> Oh, very good.<br> Excellent.<br> He likes that.<br> Well, his ideas are beautiful.<br> Social justice, the very concept...<br> Yes, he's very grateful for the<br> help you've been giving him.<br> He told me that himself.<br> He's rather surprised...<br> ...that a young man like you<br> can be quite so diligent.<br> When he was your age,<br> he was whoring in the Caucasus.<br> Couldn't get enough of it.<br> Yes, he wrote all about it.<br> He even gave me a copy,<br> so I could read all the details.<br> - Would you like some more jam?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - Have you read War and Peace?<br> - Yes, many times.<br> Twice.<br> You know, when Lev was writing it...<br> Oh, this was ages ago...<br> ...long before Chertkov created<br> that monstrosity at Telyatinki...<br> ...over all that fake religion<br> and revolutionary nonsense.<br> What do you think of Chertkov,<br> by the way?<br> Well, I think that he's...<br> He's given me<br> a wonderful opportunity.<br> Yes, but you can see<br> what a pompous fool he is...<br> ...what a self-serving<br> puritanical idiot.<br> It's been very pleasant since<br> he's been locked in his house.<br> Right.<br> So, anyway, when he was writing it,<br> in the mid-'60s...<br> ...he used to bring me pages<br> to copy every day...<br> ...because I was the only one who<br> could understand his writing or notes.<br> Do you know I copied out<br> War and Peace six times?<br> Six times?<br> I could understand<br> his intentions too.<br> So every afternoon, we'd have<br> tea and we'd discuss changes.<br> And I'd say to him:<br> "Natasha wouldn't speak to Prince<br> Andrei like that. No woman would. "<br> Or, "Pierre's too simple here.<br> He's not an idiot. "<br> You know, things like that.<br> But I don't count anymore.<br> You must help me,<br> Vladimir Fedorovich.<br> Oh, Valentin Fedorovich.<br> I only want what's best for<br> my husband and my family.<br> If it was for me alone,<br> I could tolerate the situation...<br> ...but I cannot stand by while<br> they steal my children's inheritance.<br> Well, I don't believe anybody<br> wants to do that.<br> I don't.<br> I mean...<br> Theft goes against the principles<br> of Tolstoy thought.<br> I have a little gift for you.<br> It's a diary.<br> You know, everyone<br> should always keep a diary.<br> Yes, it's a very popular<br> activity around here.<br> You're teasing us.<br> But I trust you'll<br> write the truth.<br> Well, that may not be so easy.<br> Nonsense. You've been listening<br> to your friends at Telyatinki.<br> No, no, just write<br> what you see around you.<br> What you see.<br> You're finished for the day?<br> Yes, he didn't need me<br> this afternoon.<br> I thought I'd come back here...<br> ...and lend a hand.<br> You know, Lev Nikolayevich<br> considers himself a liberal...<br> ...but he doesn't approve of<br> women doing physical labor.<br> - Don't you find that reactionary?<br> - No.<br> I find it sweet.<br> I find you reactionary.<br> What do you talk about<br> when you're with him?<br> We...<br> - Why are you blushing?<br> - I'm not.<br> We talk about me.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes.<br> He wants to know about my family,<br> my upbringing.<br> My connection to God<br> and my relations with women.<br> What relations are these?<br> All right, it's all right.<br> Well done.<br> I had a lover before I came here.<br> He was headmaster of the<br> school where I taught.<br> He was married.<br> He was happily married.<br> It was difficult.<br> We could make love<br> only at school.<br> At school?<br> In the gymnasium,<br> after the girls had gone.<br> I see.<br> I see.<br> - There you are.<br> - Have I upset you?<br> No.<br> No, I find you...<br> I appreciate your frankness.<br> - But you disapprove of me?<br> - No!<br> - I see it in your eyes.<br> - Not at all.<br> No.<br> I think sexual behavior...<br> ...and intercourse...<br> ...how two men,<br> or two women...<br> ...or men and women...<br> ...animals,<br> combine their physical parts...<br> ...I find it completely neutral.<br> Listen to you.<br> You're a prig.<br> You're just like Sergeyenko. I mean,<br> why else would they have hired you?<br> - That's not fair.<br> - I don't care if it's fair. It's true.<br> That's it.<br> - I'm going.<br> - Do as you like.<br> Valentin Fedorovich?<br> Yes?<br> You forgot your horse.<br> Yes.<br> Where's Papa?<br> I had a dream last night,<br> about a Tartar girl I knew in the war.<br> A girl who died?<br> No, no, no.

The work,<br> in her mind, is theirs, together.<br> And you're her advocate?<br> You have been taken in<br> by her celebrity.<br> - I was worried about this.<br> - I'm simply talking about their history.<br> - Nothing more.<br> - We have to see her.<br> - Act as if nothing has happened.<br> - Nothing has happened.<br> Sofya Andreyevna.<br> At last, you honor us with a visit.<br> Well, I'm curious to see how things<br> are progressing here at Telyatinki.<br> Well...<br> What is it?<br> Your mustache is...<br> No, it's just a problem<br> with the wax.<br> Vladimir Grigorevich,<br> let me come straight to the point.<br> I don't wish to be your enemy.<br> On the contrary, I am delighted<br> that my husband has found a friend...<br> ...who understands<br> and shares his ideals.<br> I just want what's reasonable.<br> I want an opportunity<br> to evaluate the new will.<br> If you agree,<br> then I'm sure we can be friends.<br> You are very kind, Sofya Andreyevna,<br> but I can't help you...<br> ...not without specific instructions<br> from your husband.<br> Oh, he has agreed.<br> Hasn't he, Valentin?<br> No witness you produce can<br> change my position, I'm afraid.<br> But I will, of course...<br> ...speak to Lev Nikolayevich<br> at the first opportunity.<br> Very well.<br> I want us to be friends too, Sofya.<br> Lev Nikolayevich is the most valuable<br> thing in the world, to both of us.<br> We should endeavor to set things<br> right between us.

That's the only<br> reality there is in the world.<br> He said that?<br> Yes, Tolstoy said it,<br> but I'm saying it.<br> I'm saying it, Masha,<br> because you make me know it.<br> I look into your eyes<br> and I can see the future.<br> I think you're the bravest<br> person I've ever met.<br> You amaze me.<br> You believe more<br> than I know how to.<br> I love you.<br> You're pure, Valya.<br> You're what I came here to find.<br> Ivan, who's wearing<br> that awful perfume?<br> I understand this is difficult.<br> It is a delicate situation.<br> This way.<br> This must be discussed now.<br> It cannot wait any longer.<br> Whatever happens,<br> Mother mustn't find out.<br> I hate to say it, but the countess has<br> become more and more dangerous.<br> Oh, not dangerous. She's concerned<br> for the welfare of the family.<br> And we're concerned<br> with the welfare of mankind.<br> - You've been more than reasonable.<br> - Have I?<br> Of course you have.<br> She already controls the income<br> from your property.<br> Please, listen to him, Papa.<br> He has our best interests at heart.<br> We are speaking only of the rights<br> to your words, your ideas.<br> With all love and respect...<br> ...the countess is too interested<br> in making a profit from your work.<br> She's my wife. She's part of me.<br> We've been together all these years.<br> But you're more than a husband<br> and father. She must understand that.<br> The best interests of the people<br> are one with your own.<br> - You belong to them.<br> - She won't. She'll never understand.<br> What is she doing?<br> - She's unstable. I wonder if she isn't ill.<br> - It's sadly more than probable.<br> I know it's hard for you, Papa,<br> but you must be realistic.<br> Her behavior is extremely alarming.<br> Do you truly think she is fit to control<br> the final disposition of this will?<br> Well, I don't...<br> I don't...<br> How dare...<br> - God!<br> - Oh, God.<br> What are you doing?<br> You're all plotting against me,<br> in my own house too!<br> I bear you 13 children.<br> How can you betray<br> me like this?<br> Somebody, help me up.<br> Go ahead.<br> Go ahead.<br> Why don't you give everything<br> we've got to him?<br> Your little catamite!<br> "What will it be, my dearest darling,<br> my Vladimir Grigorevich?<br> My wife's heart on a platter?<br> Her kidneys, with salt?<br> But of course, my dear Chertkov.<br> Whatever pleases you.<br> The china, the estate...<br> ...permanent copyright<br> on anything I've ever written?<br> Anything for you, my love.

This is Chertkov.<br> We've both disappointed him,<br> but I don't care.<br> I don't care either,<br> but you can't leave.<br> I'm going to talk to him.<br> I'm going to make him make you stay.<br> - No. I want to go.<br> - Yes. What?<br> I'm leaving the movement.<br> Sit down, sit down.<br> - You can't leave Tolstoy.<br> - I'm not.<br> - You can't leave.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> When I read his confession,<br> it moved me, Valya.<br> - Yes. - When he was<br> searching for freedom.<br> Freedom from anger,<br> freedom from attachment...<br> ...freedom from all the superstition<br> and the nonsense of the Church.<br> I mean,<br> it moved me so much.<br> And that's what I thought<br> it would be about.<br> I mean, isn't that<br> what it's about?<br> Freedom and love?<br> They mix it all up.<br> Come with me.<br> Please?<br> I can't.<br> - I'm going to my room.<br> - Wait.<br> Masha.<br> Masha, please.<br> I can't.<br> I need you.<br> I know you do.<br> I know.<br> A - Y.<br> A - Y.<br> A - Y.<br> What was it?<br> I don't remember.<br> - Was it your...<br> - No, no, no.<br> You rest now.<br> You rest.<br> Is everything in order?<br> - Good afternoon,<br> Lev Nikolayevich. - Is it?<br> Remember that<br> this will ensure...<br> ...that your complete works<br> will live in the public domain.<br> Monumentous.<br> Your works are the birthright<br> of the Russian people.<br> And now they will<br> possess them forever.<br> Yes?<br> I need a pen.<br> Of course, of course.<br> - I...<br> - What?<br> I don't seem to have a pen.<br> You're a secretary.<br> How can you not have a pen?<br> He's a secretary too.<br> Ask him.<br> Valentin Fedorovich,<br> do you have a pen?<br> I...<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I have a pen.<br> Are you all right?<br> I'm a conspirator.<br> Nothing more.<br> Lev Nikolayevich.<br> May I ask you a question that<br> has nothing to do with the work?<br> Of course, my dear.<br> Do you love your wife?<br> You see,<br> when I was courting Sofya...<br> ...she was so<br> young and so pure...<br> ...it just seemed impossible<br> that I could ever have her.<br> I didn't want to tell<br> her how I felt, and yet...<br> ...I wanted to tell<br> her nothing else.<br> So I wrote down<br> a string of letters...<br> ...and asked her if she<br> would decipher them.<br> At first, she was completely confused<br> and thought it was some sort of game.<br> So I gave her a clue.<br> One clue.<br> "The first two Y's," I said,<br> "stand for 'your youth"...<br> ...and that was all I said.<br> And then...<br> ...the most miraculous thing<br> happened.<br> She simply spoke the phrase:<br> "Your youth and your desire<br> for happiness...<br> ...cruelly remind me of my age...<br> ...and the impossibility of happiness<br> for me. "<br> The entire phrase, my phrase.<br> As if she'd read my mind.<br> In that moment, we both knew<br> we would always be together.<br> And for the first few years,<br> we were...<br> ...incredibly...<br> ...terrifyingly...<br> ...happy.<br> And now this.<br> I'm leaving Telyatinki.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes. I'm going to Moscow.<br> She's leading you around<br> by the nose, my boy.<br> Look, you say that the movement<br> is about love.<br> And it is.<br> The love that he teaches us.<br> The love that binds<br> all mankind together.<br> I've never met mankind.<br> I've only ever met men or women.<br> Imperfect men, imperfect women.<br> Yes. But Lev Nikolayevich<br> also teaches us...<br> ...that love cannot be weak-minded.<br> It cannot be stupid.<br> Go.<br> We will miss you.<br> Our naive sentimentalist.<br> Keep clear.<br> Give it to me.<br> Leovochka?<br> Kashnikov wants to buy the rights<br> to your work after your death.<br> Then I shall try and die<br> as soon as is convenient.<br> Oh, come on, don't be silly.<br> Come, look.<br> Look, he has offered<br> - How can you not be pleased?<br> - I don't write for publishers...<br> ...I write for people.<br> - Well, where are you going?<br> Valentin is in the library.<br> He wants to see me.<br> Fine!
