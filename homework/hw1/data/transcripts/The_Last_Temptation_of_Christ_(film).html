Forgive me."<br> It's not that easy.<br> Just because you need forgiveness,<br> don't ask me to do it.<br> - I'm sorry, Mary.<br> - Now get out! Go away!<br> Look, Mary. Look at this.<br> God can change this.<br> God can save your soul.<br> He already broke my heart.<br> He took you away from me.<br> And I hate both of you!<br> Hate me.

Is that the way<br> you show you're a man?<br> Turn away.<br> Don't look at me.<br> You never had the courage<br> to be a man. Don't look at me.<br> If you weren't hanging onto your mother,<br> you were hanging onto me.<br> Now you're hanging onto God.<br> Going to the desert to hide<br> because you're scared.<br> Well, go. Whenever<br> I see you, my heart breaks.<br> I do remember<br> when we were children.<br> Never have I felt so much<br> tenderness toward anyone...<br> as I felt toward you then.<br> All I ever wanted was you.<br> Nothing else.<br> What do you think I wanted?<br> Please... stay.<br> Is it so bad sharing<br> a prostitute's room?<br> I won't touch you.<br> You'll still be a virgin.<br> Mary, I'm sorry.<br> I can't stay.<br> Welcome. This way.<br> Do you always pray<br> this late at night?<br> It's a funeral.<br> The master of the monastery died.<br> Shall I pray with you?<br> No. Sleep.<br> You must be tired.<br> I know who you are.<br> [ Chanting In Distance ]<br> That was the man who<br> brought me here last night.<br> Last night?<br> He was dead last night.<br> [ Chanting Continues ]<br> The master's soul<br> is gone to heaven.<br> His body's work is completed.<br> It walked under the sun<br> and the moon...<br> over sand and stone...<br> sinned, felt pain...<br> yearned for heaven.<br> We commend his remains<br> to our god.<br> Flesh, the master<br> no longer needs you.<br> Melt away.<br> First came the wings,<br> then the angel.<br> His spirit actually<br> appeared to you.<br> He treated you<br> like a royal visitor.<br> He recognized you<br> for something.<br> No, he couldn't have<br> recognized me for anything.<br> I only came here<br> to serve God. That's all.<br> That's all God wants from me.<br> I'm sure of it.<br> But think of how you're blessed.<br> God actually makes himself<br> known to you.<br> I don't know<br> what God wants from me.<br> All my life I've wanted<br> to hear God's voice.<br> I've dedicated my life to Him.<br> Sometimes...<br> I think I feel Him,<br> but I'm never really sure.<br> But you always know.<br> God took you by the hand<br> and brought you here.<br> [ Laughs ]<br> You think it's a blessing<br> to know what God wants?<br> I'll tell you what He wants.<br> He wants to push me over!<br> Can't He see<br> what's inside of me?<br> All my sins?<br> - We all sin.<br> - Not my sins.<br> I'm a liar, a hypocrite.<br> I'm afraid of everything.<br> I don't ever tell the truth.<br> I don't have the courage.<br> When I see a woman,<br> I blush and look away.<br> I want her, but I don't<br> take her... for God.<br> And that makes me proud.<br> And then my pride ruins Magdalene.<br> I don't steal, I don't fight<br> and I don't kill.<br> Not because I don't want to,<br> but because I'm afraid.<br> I want to rebel against you,<br> against everything, again--<br> against God, but... I'm afraid.<br> You want to know<br> who my mother and father are?<br> You want to know who my god is?<br> Fear.<br> You look inside me,<br> and that's all you'll find.<br> But the more devils<br> that we have inside of us,<br> the more of a chance<br> we have to repent.<br> Lucifer is inside me.<br> He says to me,<br> "You're not the son of King David.<br> You're not a man.<br> You're the son of man.<br> And more. The Son of God.<br> And more than that. God."<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Do you want to ask me anything else?<br> [ Rattling ]<br> [ Magdalene Laughing ]<br> [ Jesus ]<br> Everything is from God.<br> Everything has two meanings.<br> [ Magdalene's Voice ]<br> Jesus, oh, my sweet Jesus.<br> I forgive you.<br> Leave me! Leave me.<br> They're gone.<br> You have to leave too.<br> No. I have to stay.<br> No, you've been purified.<br> God has just blessed you.<br> The snakes came from inside you.<br> Now you have to leave too. You have<br> to go back and speak to people...<br> - and share your heart.<br> - Speak to who?<br> - To anyone who will listen.<br> - And say what?<br> Just open your mouth.<br> Do you love mankind?<br> I see men, and I feel sorry<br> for them. That's all.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> That's enough.<br> [ Rustling ]<br> [ Grunts ]<br> I've got orders to kill you.<br> Go ahead.<br> Tonight I was purified.<br> I can't fight with God anymore.<br> Here. Here's my neck. Cut it.<br> I'm ready.<br> [ Gasps ]<br> [ Imitates Knife Slicing ]<br> What are you?<br> What kind of a man are you?<br> What you want, I want.<br> That's why<br> He brought us together.<br> I come to kill you and you help me,<br> that's God's plan?<br> These voices you hear, it's God's<br> voice? Only you understand it?<br> Well, you better make me<br> understand it too.<br> I'll tell you as much as I know.<br> The fainting spells,<br> the voices, the visions.<br> Power, magic.<br> Is there some secret?<br> - Tell me your secret.<br> - Pity.<br> - Pity for who? Yourself?<br> - Pity for men.<br> - Our enemies are men.<br> - I feel pity for everything.<br> Donkeys, asses, sparrows.<br> What about ants?<br> Feel pity for them too?<br> Yes. Everything's<br> a part of God.<br> When I see an ant,<br> when I look at his shiny black eye...<br> you know what I see?<br> I see the face of God.<br> You're not afraid of dying?<br> Why should I be?<br> Death isn't a door<br> that closes; it opens.<br> It opens,<br> and you go through it.<br> If I don't kill you,<br> what happens?<br> I'll speak to people.<br> What are you going to say?<br> I'll just open my mouth,<br> and God will do the talking.<br> Maybe God didn't send you<br> here to kill me.<br> Maybe He sent you here<br> to follow me.<br> Just so there's no mistake,<br> I'll go with you<br> until I understand.<br> But if you stray this much...<br> from the path, I'll kill you.<br> [ Shouting, Screaming ]<br> [ Screaming ]<br> Stop!<br> [ Screaming Continues ]<br> It's Magdalene.<br> She deserves it.<br> [ Sobbing, Whimpering ]<br> - [ Men Shouting ] Stone her!<br> - [ Screaming ]<br> [ Man ]<br> Get out of there!<br> Get out of the way!<br> This is not your business!<br> Do you want to get hurt?<br> Didn't you hear, idiot?<br> Move!<br> No. I don't want this.<br> Listen to him.<br> He doesn't want this. Well, we want it.<br> - Why?<br> - We don't have to tell you!<br> Bad enough we live<br> in a whorehouse.<br> But she's a Jew!<br> She works on the sabbath.<br> She goes with Romans.<br> She broke Moses' law. She dies!<br> Who has never sinned? Who?<br> Which one of you people<br> has never sinned?<br> Whoever that is...<br> come up here!<br> And throw these!<br> I have nothing to hide.<br> Good. Take this.<br> It's bigger.<br> [ Whimpers ]<br> Be careful, Zebedee.<br> There is a god.<br> He's seen you<br> cheat your workers.<br> He's seen you with that widow.<br> What's her name?<br> - [ Woman ] Judith.<br> - Judith.<br> Aren't you afraid God will paralyze you<br> if you lift that stone?<br> That your arm will wither?<br> That you'll lose all strength?<br> [ Sobbing ]<br> [ Whimpering ]<br> [ Jesus ]<br> God has so many miracles.<br> What if I say the wrong thing?<br> What if I say the right thing?<br> Come closer.<br> Come closer!<br> We're all a family.<br> Come closer so you can hear.<br> I have something to tell you.<br> Who is he?<br> It's Jesus from Nazareth.<br> Nothing good can come out of Nazareth.<br> The scriptures say so.<br> Uh...<br> I'm-- I'm sorry, but...<br> the easiest way<br> to make myself clear...<br> is to tell you a story.<br> A farmer was planting in his field.<br> Some seed fell on the ground,<br> and the birds ate it.<br> Some seed fell on rocks<br> and dried up.<br> But some seed--<br> Some seed fell on rich soil...<br> and grew into enough wheat<br> to feed a whole nation.<br> - Can you hear me?<br> - Oh, we can hear you fine.<br> I'm the farmer!<br> The farmer is me.<br> And two and two makes four.<br> Another lunatic!<br> Rabbi... tell me.<br> If you're the farmer...<br> and we're the stones,<br> what's the seed?<br> What's the seed?<br> Love.<br> Love one another.<br> That's easy to say. Maybe that's<br> good advice, but for some other world.<br> These people are starving.<br> First feed them, then talk.<br> I used to think God was angry too,<br> but not anymore!<br> He used to jump on me<br> like a wild bird...<br> and dig His claws into my head.<br> But then one morning,<br> He came to me.<br> He blew over me<br> like a cool breeze...<br> and said, "Stand up."<br> And here I am.<br> - And you will go to hell.<br> - These are children's stories.<br> - How can they help?<br> - What are you hungry for?<br> What are you thirsty for?<br> - Justice!<br> - And bread.<br> Bread?
