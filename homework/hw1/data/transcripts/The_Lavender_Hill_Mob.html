                        - Is this your first visit to South America?<br> - Yes.<br> I wish I could stay longer.<br> It's a pleasant place.<br> Senor, congratulations.<br> A wonderful party. Thank you, senora.<br> The president himself told my husband<br> it was the occasion of the year.<br> Oh, senora. I was going to send you this<br> for your subscription list.<br> The, uh, victims of the revolution.<br> Perhaps I may be allowed<br> to give it to you now.<br> Thank you, senor.<br> Always so generous. Oh.<br> The wife of Martin Gallardo,<br> the frozen meat king.<br> Very decent couple. Oh, excuse me.<br> Manuel?<br> Pity you can't stay till sunday.<br> I've got a horse<br> in the Jockey Club stakes.<br> You... Rode...<br> A very good race.<br> A very good race.<br> Racing's not quite straight<br> out here.<br> Still, I do believe I've helped<br> to raise the standard a little.<br> Ah, Chiquita! Chiquita!<br> I hoped I'd see you. Mm.<br> You run along and get yourself<br> that little birthday present.<br> Oh, but how sweet of you.<br> Thank you!<br> You seem to have accomplished<br> quite a lot in one year.<br> One superb year.<br> Just when I was beginning to believe<br> I'd never achieve it.<br> For 20 years,<br> I've dreamed of a life like this.<br> For 19 of those years,<br> fate denied me the one contact...<br> Essential to the success<br> of all my plans.<br> Still, I never quite lost sight<br> of the goal.<br> Inaccessible<br> as it often seemed to me...<br> When I was merely a...<br> Merely a nonentity...<br> Among all those thousands<br> who flock every morning into the city.<br> Most men who long to be rich know inwardly<br> that they will never achieve their ambition.<br> But I was in the unique position of having<br> a fortune literally within my grasp.<br> For it was my job to supervise<br> the deliveries of bullion...<br> From the gold refinery<br> to the bank.<br> - Lucky I saw that.<br> - Yes, very lucky.<br> Mr. Richards, with gold<br> at 240 shillings per fine ounce,<br> That particle,<br> estimating its value at, uh, .025,<br> Would entail a loss<br> of approximately six shillings.<br> Well, I've got a bit more out here<br> for you to check.<br> One hundred gold bars,<br> weighed to the value of 495,987!<br> Well, Mr. Richards, your deposit...<br> Will be returned in the usual way,<br> as soon as the gold enters the bank.<br> You are both armed?<br> I was well aware they all ridiculed me<br> for the way I fussed and worried.<br> That was precisely what I had striven<br> for years to achieve.<br> Here we go again.<br> There's a car been following us.<br> - That one, sir?<br> - No, of course not.<br> A black Chrysler, THX-375.<br> It's gone on ahead.<br> No sign of it now, sir.<br> It's probably waiting for us<br> around the next corner.<br> Go and have a look...<br> and leave me your gun, meanwhile.<br> Nobody could say that my precautions<br> were not fully justified.<br> Many a rascal would have<br> risked his all for half a million,<br> Not realizing that gold,<br> in the form of bullion,<br> Is useless without a method<br> of smuggling it abroad.<br> To find that method was my last<br> remaining problem. Come in.<br> Meanwhile,<br> I gave the bank their gold.<br> - Oh, thanks, Holland.<br> Everything quite in order?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Silly question. Twenty years,<br> and nothing's ever been out of order yet.<br> Er, that will do, Holland.<br> Why don't you give<br> that poor old devil a chance?<br> Surely, after all this time,<br> he deserves a leg up.<br> Oh, I'm afraid<br> it wouldn't work, sir.<br> His one and only virtue<br> is honesty.<br> He has no imagination,<br> no initiative, sir.<br> I was a potential millionaire.<br> Yet I had to be satisfied with eight pounds,<br> fifteen shillings, less deductions.<br> A weekly reminder<br> that the years were passing,<br> And my problem still unsolved.<br> Until my ship came home,<br> I was obliged to live...<br> At the Balmoral private hote<br> in Lavender Hill.<br> Ah, Holland!<br> The man of millions.<br> What did you get away with today?<br> Got any spare ingots for an old pal?<br> You'll be the death of me,<br> Holland!<br> I sincerely trust so.<br> Ah, Mr. Holland.<br> Always punctual.<br> I smell oxtail soup again.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Now, let's see.<br> Where did we get?<br> Duke Milligan was about to take a gander<br> at Nicky the Greek's hideout.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Now, here we are.<br> "I handed my fedora<br> to a hat-check girl...<br> "with all that Venus de Milo had got,<br> and then more,<br> "and I was admiring the more<br> when I glimmed something...<br> "in the back of this frail<br> that set my underwear...<br> Creeping up on me like it had legs."<br> I know that feeling well.<br> "A guy had soft-shoed out of the door<br> from the gaming room...<br> "as quiet as a snake on tip-belly.<br> "and I didn't need my case history<br> of smiling Ed Montana...<br> To know that Sonny boy was his<br> number-one triggerman, Ricci the Filipino."<br> I thought it was little boy Schultz<br> who carried the rod for Mr. Montana.<br> It was, Mrs. Chalk.<br> But surely you remember?<br> Montana found Schultz<br> taking liberties with that redhead.<br> Yes, yes.<br> They took him for a ride.<br> Only last night, wasn't it?<br> Oh, I must be getting old.<br> Read on, Mr. Holland.<br> "If ever I felt like putting up<br> a new high for the mile of the century,<br> This was the time."<br> "And then I thought again<br> of those 10,000 smackeroos..."<br> Yes?<br> Mr. Holland,<br> you're not concentrating.<br> So sorry.<br> Evesham must be upstairs.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> Tricky business,<br> this moving, isn't it?<br> - You've got a lot of stuff here.<br> - Yeah.<br> Can I give you a hand?<br> Oh, that's very civil of you.<br> My name's Pendlebury.<br> Holland. Yeah.<br> If you wouldn't mind<br> taking "motherhood"...<br> Good evening, Mr. Pendlebury.<br> Welcome to Balmoral.<br> How very nice to see you.<br> Oh! Mr. Pendlebury!<br> I knew you were<br> an artistic gentleman, but really!<br> - Take all this.<br> - Oh! Thank you.<br> I thought I'd made myself quite plain<br> when I phoned, miss Evesham.<br> I'd... I'd no idea it would mean...<br> But there's no place<br> to put it all!<br> - What about the stable?<br> - I suppose it could go there.<br> Mind your toes, miss Evesham.<br> Back shortly, Mrs. Chalk.<br> Oh, this is capital.<br> Capital!<br> A ready-made studio!<br> A thing I wanted all my life.<br> Why, it's even<br> got a north light, too.<br> Mr. Pendlebury, just one moment.<br> The terms of my lease...<br> Oh, I say! Steady, steady, steady.<br> So sorry.<br> Oh, it's all right. I had to g...<br> had to cast her in gilding metal.<br> It's a little delicate, you know?<br> Mr. Pendlebury...<br> I did it in my factory.<br> You must see it one of these days.<br> Mr. Pendlebury!<br> Ooh, these walls!<br> Oh, an admirable background<br> for my canvases.<br> Mr. Pendlebury!<br> Let me inform you here and now...<br> That no business occupation<br> may be performed on these premises.<br> Oh-ho, my dear lady. This is not<br> my business occupation. I wish it were.<br> No, these are my wings.<br> My escape after the cares<br> of the day are over.<br> My business occupation<br> is something unspeakably hideous.<br> I'm in the "Presents from" trade.<br> You know, "Presents from Brighton,"<br> "Souvenir of Tunbridge Wells."<br> Yes, if tourists only realized,<br> they could save themselves<br> a lot of luggage space...<br> By applying to us direct<br> for their holiday memories.<br> And the irony of it,<br> Holland, the irony is...<br> I must design them<br> all myself.<br> I propagate<br> british cultural depravity.<br> Look at this.<br> Anne hathaway's cottage...<br> for keeping string in.<br> Wouldn't you infinitely prefer<br> the comparative purity of an old biscuit tin?<br> Southend pier!<br> Oh, I... I've thought for years<br> to cut loose from it all,<br> But I never had the courage.<br> "Of all sad words<br> of tongue or pen,<br> "the saddest are these:<br> 'It might have been'".<br> Forgive me.<br> Come and see the casting room.<br> We're busy at present on one<br> of our export lines. Paperweights.<br> We ship a thousand a week<br> over to France.<br> Here's a little... speciality.<br> Quite a simple process, really.<br> Pour the molten lead into the mold,<br> allow it to harden.<br> As soon as it's cool,<br> it's sprayed with gold paint...<br> And then it's ready<br> to be shipped to France.<br> "Slave, I have set my life<br> upon a cast."<br> Richard III.<br> I believe it's turning<br> into a self-portrait.<br> I shall call him<br> "the slave."<br> Oh, my dear Holland, I'm so sorry.<br> You're still feeling bad.<br> The heat of that place. I always forget.<br> No, it wasn't the heat.<br> I'm used to that in my job.<br> Oh, really?<br> Your place is very similar to a refinery.<br> Really? I had no idea.<br> We turn gold into bars,<br> you turn lead into Eiffel Towers.<br> That's the only difference. Only!<br> If I had gold to deal with...<br> - Yes?<br> - Ah, an idle dream.<br> - Must be a big responsibility.<br> - No, not really.<br> If anyone did rob our van, well,<br> it's virtually impossible to dispose<br> of stolen bullion,<br> In this country, at any rate.<br> Yes. Oh, yes, I imagine so.<br> But if it could be smuggled abroad...<br> What a hope. Well, I wouldn't say<br> it's out of the question.<br> Saying one had the means<br> of melting the stuff down.<br> In the kitchen stove?<br> What a job.<br> Oh, of course not.<br> It would mean taking<br> on a partner.<br> Ah, Risky.<br> Bringing other people in.<br> That would be essential,<br> in any case.<br> No one person could rob<br> our van unaided.<br> You mean,<br> he'd need accomplices?<br> Precisely.<br> A gang.<br> A gang?<br> Not so easy to come by.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> With gold sitting<br> on the continental black market...<br> At two and a half times<br> its standard price?<br> I mean, quite a few people<br> would be willing to chance an arm<br> for half a million.<br> Yes, but how...<br> How would you get your gold<br> across to the continent?<br> Well.<br> Supposing one had<br> the right sort of partner,<br> In the form of, uh, shall we say...<br> Eiffel Tower paperweights?<br> By Jove, Holland, it's a good job.<br> We are both honest men.<br> It is indeed, Pendlebury.<br> Come in.<br> Oh, there you are, Holland.<br> Come in and sit down.<br> Well, Holland, you've been quite<br> the subject of discussion lately.<br> Don't look so worried, man.<br> I've managed to persuade<br> the chief cashier to give you a leg up.<br> A leg up, sir? Promotion.<br> You're going up<br> to foreign exchange.<br> No more uncomfortable journeys<br> in that dreary van.<br> But, sir... now, now,<br> nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.<br> Don't bother to thank me, man.<br> I told abercrombie that you can start<br> with him next monday.<br> - But I can't, sir!<br> - Why not?<br> Because, um...<br> Because... I'm too old<br> to change my views now, sir.<br> Ah, one's never too old<br> to better oneself.<br> Think what you can do<br> with an extra 15 shillings a week!<br> But sir, I like the bullion office.<br> It holds all I ever wished for.<br> The trouble with you, Holland,<br> if I may speak frankly,<br> Is that you<br> haven't enough ambition.<br> When a good opportunity comes along,<br> grab it with both hands!<br> It may not occur again.<br> Very good, sir.<br> I'll follow your advice.<br> So it's now or never.<br> Friday's delivery. This week.<br> Three days to go.<br> Two desperadoes to find.<br> - Bait.<br> - Bait?<br> I said, bait. Trap 'em!<br> Mr. Pendlebury?<br> - Hello, Mr. Pendlebury!<br> - Hello!<br> Why, good evening. Ha!<br> By Jove, what a bit of luck!<br> Just the man I wanted to see.<br> What's the trouble? That safe in my office.<br> Something's gone wrong with the lock.<br> I'll send a man round tomorrow.<br> I wish you would. It worries me a little,<br> Leaving the staff wages there overnight.<br> You know the address: "Gewgaws, limited."<br> "Gewgaws, limited."<br> You know, the back of rathbing place, there.<br> Fancy leaving all that money there.<br> Why, anybody could break<br> into the place tonight,<br> And help themselves!<br> Come on, number five!<br> You've done it.<br> Stay there, me beauty, stay there!<br> One never knows.<br> Somebody may have been listening.<br> I suggest we give them till midnight.<br> - Where are those guns?<br> - Guns?<br> Yes. It's essential that we're armed.<br> Here they are.<br> Here's yours. Is it loaded?<br> Yes. It's a present from Margate.<br> It fires a stick of rock.<br> The safe's in the office, over there.<br> You squeeze behind that bench,<br> and surprise anyone making for the safe.<br> I'm going over here, to prevent<br> an escape through the packing room.<br> Ready?<br> - What's that?<br> - Cramp.<br> - What?<br> - Pins and needles.<br> Reach for it.<br> Don't shoot, Guv. Don't shoot.<br> I won't give no trouble.<br> Please don't be 'ard on me.<br> I got a wife and six kids.<br> I never done<br> nothing like this before.<br> - Is that true?<br> - Yes, Guv. I'm on the level.<br> May I drop dead if I lie.<br> I been honest all me life.<br> It was just the temptation.<br> - This is your first crime?<br> - Yes, Guv. I swear it.<br> And I'll never<br> go wrong no more.<br> Suppose we asked you<br> to do a job for us. I'd do it.<br> That's all I want. A chance<br> to turn an honest penny.<br> Well, supposing it wasn't exactly<br> an honest penny.<br> Careful now, careful. We don't want<br> anyone who's going straight.<br> In any case, we need someone far bigger. Mm.<br> Such as me?<br> Who are you? Who are you?<br> Oh, take those things away.<br> I'm not hungry.<br> Name of Lackery Wood.<br> Otherwise known as Sawdust Steve,<br> the wandsworth boy.<br> Two convictions for 'ousebreaking,<br> one for larceny of the person.<br> Total 18 months only,<br> in 10 years' work.<br> Here you are... some cuttings,<br> if you'd like to see 'em.<br> How long have you been here?<br> Just long enough to hide<br> when I heard you comin' in.<br> Thought I'd been taken for a mug!<br> Me! What's the job?<br> Useful.<br> Never worked nothing else<br> but single-handed.<br> Sensible.<br> Very sensible.<br> Just the same meself.<br> Kept on me Jack Jones<br> ever since Nobby Curtis got me done...<br> - For that job at Bellamy's.<br> - Bellamy's in Bromley?<br> That's right. Last June, twelve month.<br> I was casing that joint...<br> The night you got pinched!<br> Well, what do you know?<br> I'm shorty fisher.<br> Ah, nice to have met ya.<br> Excuse me, I... I may be slow,<br> but do I understand...<br> That you two are, in fact,<br> Both professional criminals?<br> What else do you take us for?<br> Ruddy snoopers? What's the setup?<br> Just a moment, Pendlebury.<br> We require a team,<br> And if these two gentlemen<br> insist on working alone...<br> Wait a minute. You make it worth our while,<br> cock, we'll work in with the band of hope.<br> Eh, shorty? You said it.<br> Well, in that case,<br> if you would both join us in the office,<br> My friend Mr. Holland<br> will outline what we have in mind.<br> I must apologize, gentlemen,<br> for the somewhat informal manner...<br> In which we effected<br> our introduction.<br> But my colleague and I<br> have a certain proposition...<br> Which we'd like to put to you.<br> I might almost call it<br> a "gilt-edged proposition,"<br> Although, paradoxically,<br> it does entail a measure of risk.<br> However, when I quote<br> the anticipated dividend,<br> I'm sure that you will both agree<br> with me that the...<br> Not another one, surely.<br> Tell him we're suited.<br> - Everything all right here, sir?<br> - Yes, thank you, officer.<br> My, uh, my partner<br> and I are busy stock-taking.<br> - Only I saw the window open, you see?<br> - Oh, yes, yes.<br> I'll close it. Thank you very much.<br> Good night, officer.<br> Good night, sir.<br> And, um, here's the order<br> for tomorrow's consignment.<br> Somewhat larger<br> than I expected: 212 bars.<br> That won't worry me, sir.<br> Dependable to the last.<br> I'm going to miss you, Holland.<br> You're very kind, sir.<br> I shall always have the happiest memories<br> of the dear old bullion office.<br> Has Mr. Abercrombie spoken to you<br> about your holiday?<br> Yes, sir. I'm going to Paris. Paris, eh?<br> You're stepping out, Holland.<br> Wonderful, isn't it,<br> what a little extra money will do.<br> Yes. It's going to make a big difference to me.<br> Oh! Have a go-round out on your own now.<br> Thank you, mate. That's it.<br> And how are you getting on?<br> No, you must show some sense of proportion.<br> Look at that seagull.<br> It's bigger than the funnel.<br> - Can't I do something else, Guv?<br> - Sell matches, or boot laces.<br> No, no. Mr. Holland specified<br> a pavement artist,<br> And a pavement artist<br> it's got to be.<br> Come on, try again.<br> It's coming slowly.<br> You're teaching the wrong man.<br> Well, I had to change them over.<br> Shorty can't ride a bicycle.<br> Doesn't look as if he can,<br> either.<br> We're learnin' him.<br> Why couldn't you Learn shorty?<br> Because Lackery's color-blind.<br> - What's that got to do with it?<br> - Oh, my dear Holland,<br> Do use your intelligence;<br> if a policeman were to come along<br> and see a green sunset...<br> Over a purple sea... all right, all right.<br> Spare me the details.<br> - Is everything else fixed?<br> - Yes, the map's in the office.<br> Come along, this is the setup.<br> Uh, Mr. Fisher will be sitting here.<br> The van will stop in front of him at 4:30.<br> A minute later, the guard<br> will appear round this corner,<br> And you, Pendlebury, will detain him<br> for at least half a minute.<br> Ask him for a light, ask him anything,<br> but keep him there.<br> We must have those 30 seconds.<br> Edgar!<br> I beg your pardon?<br> Isn't one supposed to say that<br> when one's being briefed?<br> On my rare visits to the kinema...<br> the word is "Roger."<br> Oh, Roger! How silly of me.<br> To continue.<br> As soon as we've captured the van,<br> Mr. Wood and Mr. Pendlebury...<br> Will proceed straight to the warehouse.<br> Bit risky, isn't it?<br> Making Mr. Pendlebury go there,<br> after the guard's seen him?<br> It's a risk we must take.<br> We need everyone.<br> We've more than 200 bars to move,<br> and I must have my alibi.<br> You've got to gag me, bind me,<br> tear my clothes, roll me in the dust.<br> We can't afford to waste one second.<br> Okay. You're the boss.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, that's right. I am.<br> Two hundred and eleven,<br> Two hundred and twelve.<br> Ah, Mr. Richards.

It's all a ghastly mistake,<br> officer. I'm completely innocent.<br> - Did you see that car?<br> - Yes, sir. Police car.<br> What? Nothing to be afraid of there, sir.<br> Bloke was a copper.<br> I... It's some trick.<br> I'm sure it's the same car<br> that followed us the other day.<br> - You want me to go<br> and look round the corner, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> It's all a mistake, officer.<br> You got a flat tire there, mate!<br> Help! Help!<br> - Help! Help! Police!<br> - What's happened?<br> The van! They've pinched the van!<br> What's this?<br> Our van. Stolen. Load of bullion.<br> Kidnapped the boss.<br> Hoi!

Will he split?<br> No.<br> Then it don't matter.<br> We can deliver the stuff as arranged.<br> We don't need him.<br> Come on.<br> Sergeant Wilson,<br> you take your men and search...<br> The east end of the street,<br> moving down towards the center.<br> Sergeant Cripps, you take the west end<br> and move down here to meet Sergeant Wilson.<br> Rose, come with me. We'd better<br> have a look at those warehouses.<br> That's all right. Leave the rest.<br> Blimey, guv'nor, why?<br> Help my alibi.<br> Turn it up, Guv.<br> There's 75,000 quid in there.<br> I said, leave it.<br> A ruddy waste.<br> There's many a starving bloke'd<br> be glad of that lot.<br> Come on, now.<br> Fix me up.

Sir!<br> - I'll get you!<br> - Fight going on over there.<br> Purely an oversight, officer.<br> I had something on my mind.<br> Three pictures in a week<br> I missed from there.<br> You can't accuse him of taking<br> those others, too. I should think not.<br> I'm no thief, officer.<br> My character's an open book.<br> Well?<br> Well, you might as well know. I was lying.<br> I am a thief.<br> It was madness to attempt it.<br> We weren't cut out for crime, either of us.<br> We? My partner and i.<br> Your partner?<br> If you're working with a fence<br> who's got them other pictures...<br> Shh. Carry on.<br> Oh, I make no excuses.<br> All my life it's been my ambition<br> to surround myself with rare<br> and beautiful things.<br> Suddenly faced<br> with this golden opportunity... here.<br> You call that picture of mine<br> rare and beautiful?<br> Since you will keep on interrupting me,<br> you ought to know...<br> It's a charming example of an early rochet,<br> While he was still<br> under the influence of Corot.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> How much is it worth?<br> Ten pounds,<br> to those who can afford it.<br> Oh, Blimey.<br> I've got it marked up at five Bob.<br> - Here, what about this charge?<br> - Let him go.<br> I've got to get back<br> before they sell that picture!<br> Your lucky day, it seems.<br> All right.

We're up<br> against some very tough customers.<br> - Here, what are you doin'?<br> - They'll have to put a new floor in.<br> He'll be able to afford it.<br> Get on with the job.<br> You make me sick.<br> What's happened?<br> She only just made it.<br> Here! I thought you was pinched.<br> No, it's Holland they've got.<br> Holland? I was in the police station<br> when they brought him in, under arrest.<br> - You sure of that?<br> - Of course I'm sure!<br> He was all dripping wet.<br> There were two policemen holding him.<br> They must have seen everything.<br> We gotta blow.<br> Nah, wait a minute.<br> Can they connect you with him?<br> I don't know.<br> We both live at the same house, but...<br> The map! What?<br> The map showing the route<br> from here to the warehouse.<br> - Holland took it home with him.<br> - Now we are done for.<br> No, we're not.<br> You finish the job.<br> Come on.

So sorry.<br> Anything I can do?<br> We've traced four vans...<br> Seen near the warehouse<br> at the time of the robbery.<br> It's just possible you may have got<br> a glimpse of one.<br> Um, a blue van with the name<br> "loveday and bone" on the side.<br> No. It all happened so quickly.<br> They never gave me a chance.<br> Well, you never know.<br> A white van. "The blackheath spotless laundry."<br> No, I'm afraid not. Another blue one.<br> "The spring song mattress company".<br> No. Uh, as I told you...<br> A green van.<br> "Gewgaws, limited".<br> Does that ring a bell?<br> No.<br> It was definitely none of them.<br> You can't say that for certain<br> if you didn't see it, can you?<br> Ha.

What did you say?<br> Nothing like a change I always say.<br> Smile now. The police may be watching.<br> The police? Ha.<br> They suspect your van was involved.<br> Oh! I told you it was madness<br> to come back.<br> Good thing we did. This makes it<br> more important we get hold of those towers.<br> Oh, I was a fool<br> to let you persuade me.<br> You're acting like a fool now.<br> Suspicions aren't evidence.<br> Once we get those out of reach...<br> We've got to get Ourselves<br> out of their reach.<br> I'm going after those towers.<br> Are you?<br> Well, I'm going back to Paris.<br> Very well.<br> But remember, if I fail,<br> you're for it too.<br> Did you trace those girls<br> Yes.

Sit down girls.<br> These gentlemen are from the firm<br> that makes the Eiffel Tower models...<br> That some of you bought in Paris.<br> It appears that, by a mistake,<br> you were sold a new experimental type...<br> Which they're anxious to have back.<br> They'll exchange them for others equally good.<br> Also... and I consider this most generous...<br> They will give ten shillings...<br> To each girl who helps them in this way.<br> Here you are. And for you.<br> There's yours.<br> And that's for you. Thank you.<br> One, two, three, four, five.<br> Only five.<br> Who bought the sixth one?<br> Who bought the sixth?<br> June Edwards bought one.<br> You have one,<br> too, have you dear?<br> Where is it, June?

Think of all<br> the sweeties you could buy with this.<br> There we are.<br> Just as pretty, isn't it?<br> Really, June. Look at them together<br> and you'll see.<br> There's no difference, is there?<br> Now, come on. Tell us.<br> What's the difference?<br> That one is mine.<br> Well, I'm sorry.<br> I can't force the child to give it up.<br> - Does the odd one really matter?<br> - Indeed, it does, madam.<br> Were it to fall into the hands of...<br> a business rival...<br> Yes.<br> But that won't happen.<br> We've kept you too long as it is.<br> Thank you very much.<br> But, but I... but... what?<br> Oh. That's interesting.<br> I bought a pyramid stud box<br> in Cairo during the war.<br> I suppose that was made here too.<br> I suspect so.<br> We send stuff all over the world.<br> Just finished, sir.<br> Good.
