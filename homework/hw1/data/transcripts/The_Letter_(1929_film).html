                        I'm not sure I know how it began.<br> But in the midst of a life<br> that I now barely remember,<br> in the midst of those now-forgotten<br> New York days and nights,<br> something happened.<br> I believe it's all true,<br> but it started with a dream.<br> There was a woman onstage...<br> and a piano...<br> and a man.<br> As happens in a dream,<br> I felt that someone was<br> looking at me.<br> I knew he was there,<br> but I couldn't see him.<br> Someone was looking at me, smiling.<br> And then I was looking<br> at a woman onstage.<br> I think she could hear footsteps.<br> I could hear her breath.<br> And then the dream ended, I think,<br> and I was in a rehearsal.<br> That was...<br> - yeah, it was really--<br> - It was good?<br> really-- no, it's--<br> I think that there's--<br> we can use it<br> somewhere in the piece.<br> Maybe...<br> - someone watching you do it...<br> - Watching.<br> ...or something, you know?<br> It's so strange,<br> intense.<br> intense.<br> And then you came.<br> Tyrone? Hey.<br> I'm so glad you're here.<br> - I'm-- I'm Martine.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi, good to meet you.<br> - It's really great...<br> And maybe that's where<br> the story really begins.<br> - Everyone, this is Tyrone.<br> - Hi.<br> - This is Raymond Carlisle...<br> - Welcome.<br> - Thanks.<br> -...Julie Abbott, Anita Ford.<br> - Hey.<br> - Tyrone Devlin.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> - So... good, really.<br> - All right.<br> - I, uh-- I saw you in that--<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> --that film.<br> You know, that one--<br> that French thing about<br> the translator, the writer.<br> No. I don't think so, no.<br> Oh, I thought--<br> - really?<br> - Yeah, that wasn't me.<br> Well, are you--<br> you must be super tired.<br> We're just-- I don't do--<br> I don't usually do a read-through,<br> - so we're just gonna do little bits.<br> - Oh.<br> - Okay.<br> - Just hang out or--<br> - I'd rather not just watch but--<br> - Oh, okay.<br> You can't be serious--<br> you and him?<br> Of course I'm not serious.<br> - I'm teasing you.<br> - Oh.<br> And then we all had<br> our first rehearsal together.<br> Julie was there...<br> I can't believe that you chose him.<br> ...and Raymond was there.<br> I can't believe you chose him.<br> - "Believe that you want him."<br> - It's...<br> "Belie-- believe that you--"<br> I can't believe that you want him.<br> Well, but I do.<br> Of course I'm not serious.<br> I'm teasing you.<br> Oh. Okay.<br> So...<br> Of course I'm not serious.<br> I was teasing you.<br> Oh. Okay.<br> Tyrone enters.<br> Knock knock.<br> We were just speaking of you.<br> Nothing seemed particularly unusual<br> - in that first rehearsal.<br> - Well, I'm flattered.<br> - What did you say?<br> - She was teasing me.<br> - That's not very nice.<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> She said she was<br> gonna go away with you.<br> Did she really?<br> Yes. Yes, I did. I told him that.<br> Imagine my surprise.<br> Imagine.<br> Well, I imagine it surprised you.<br> Sorry, maybe get up on<br> "She said she was<br> going away with you."<br> You want to kind of test him,<br> linger, see if they're<br> hiding something.<br> See if he reacts.<br> So you wanna make it stronger,<br> challenge him.<br> Okay.<br> - She was teasing me.<br> - Well, that's not nice.<br> She said<br> she was gonna go away with you.<br> Oh, she did?<br> Never mind that.<br> No, just stay seated. Sorry.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> You can't be serious--<br> you and him?<br> Of course I'm not serious.<br> - I'm teasing you.<br> - Oh.<br> On that first night, of course,<br> we didn't yet know who you were...<br> or what you would do to us.<br> Just teasing, of course.<br> Of course.<br> Or what you would do to me.<br> I'm sorry. So can--<br> what's...<br> I don't know.<br> What's going on between them?<br> What do you mean?<br> I don't know.<br> I just-- I don't get it.<br> I-- I don't-- it seems like<br> they're not saying anything.<br> - Sorry. Never mind.<br> - No no, say.<br> I don't-- do they know--<br> do they have any idea,<br> - like, what's going on? Do--<br> - I don't, um--<br> hmm. What do you--<br> - what are-- what are your thoughts?<br> - I think--<br> - Yeah.<br> - It's not me. I don't--<br> I mean, I just--<br> I don't-- I just don't<br> really like 'em, I guess.<br> Oh. Okay.<br> Let me--<br> I don't know.<br> Anita was there too.<br> There's passion. It's just,<br> you know,<br> - not for their spouses.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Say you're looking at someone<br> but you're thinking of someone else--<br> or maybe you're<br> just thinking of yourself,<br> or just nothing.<br> Actually, I think<br> that's the most common<br> or the most pleasant thing to think--<br> just think nothing,<br> if that's possible.<br> I think it is.<br> You know.<br> Look, there's--<br> there's something furtive that--<br> that gives you a thrill<br> and the play is about that thrill.<br> - What does furtive mean?<br> - Hidden.<br> - Secrets. You all have secrets.<br> - Yeah.<br> Um, I'll be right back.<br> I don't know why, but I've never<br> been able to do hidden very well.<br> I guess I'm just not<br> very good at secrets.<br> Sure you are.<br> You don't know her.<br> Mmm, that's right, I don't,<br> but I think she's good at secrets.<br> I don't get it.<br> Why would you say that?<br> You know why I would say that.<br> Mmm, do I-- no.<br> No, I really--<br> I really don't.<br> - I don't get it.<br> - You don't?<br> - Hm-mmm.<br> - I think you do. I think you both do.<br> S-- sorry, I don't.<br> Excuse me.<br> - That was really weird, right?<br> - Oh my God.<br> - That's not funny.<br> - No, I'm sorry.<br> - It's not funny.<br> - Was that me? That was weird.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> - You okay?<br> - Yeah, sure. Why?<br> It's nice to finally meet you.<br> You too.<br> - Yeah, I'll see you in a minute.<br> - See you.<br> You missed--<br> - you missed a strange thing.<br> - What?<br> - Tell me.<br> - Tyrone was just--<br> I don't know.<br> I think he was just playing around.<br> Doing something. I don't--<br> Hmm?<br> It's nothing. He was just--<br> I guess he was kidding.<br> I don't know.<br> It was-- it was weird. It's fine.<br> - It's fine.<br> - He's coming back.<br> Okay.<br> - Whoo!<br> - Hey, everything okay?<br> Yeah, fine.<br> I didn't mean to upset you.<br> Did I?<br> - Did I upset you, Anita?<br> - It's-- I don't--<br> I just really don't know<br> what you were saying.<br> - Um...<br> - What happened?<br> - I--<br> - I missed it.<br> I was teasing Anita and...<br> I think I was--<br> I was misunderstood.<br> I-- I just--<br> I'm clumsy sometimes.<br> - I-- I don't mean to be.<br> - I don't know.<br> Sometimes it takes me<br> a little while to get<br> the gears going and everything.<br> You all seem like very nice people,<br> I think.<br> Gee, thanks.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, I'm certainly<br> glad that<br> you all are doing this piece.<br> I have a really good feeling about it<br> and I just wanted to say cheers<br> - to all of you.<br> - Cheers.<br> Ah. So, Martine,<br> what did you think<br> of what you saw today?<br> What did you think?<br> well, I was curious why you chose<br> to focus on these people,<br> because they don't--<br> they don't seem very much like you.<br> You don't know her.<br> Oh, I- I--<br> That's true, Anita.<br> I don't.<br> That's very--<br> that's very true.<br> Well, I-- I think they're interesting.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Do you think they're interesting?<br> Hmm.<br> Uh, yes, I-- probably, yeah.<br> They probably are.<br> I don't get your point, Tyrone.<br> What-what-- what's your point?<br> You know what it is?<br> I'm just tired.<br> I-- I--<br> I'm gonna excuse myself.<br> Really?<br> Yeah.<br> - I'll see y'all later.<br> - See you tomorrow.<br> He's a load of laughs.<br> I like him.<br> It's probably hard for him.<br> We all know each other,<br> he's just coming in.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I'm sure he's intimidated by me.<br> I'm sure he was.<br> I dreamt that I was under a tree.<br> Oh, Tyrone. Hi.<br> Where are you going?<br> I was up all night,<br> but I think I was dreaming,<br> so I must've slept some.<br> Um, you like Julie?<br> Yeah, I like Julie too.<br> Now try it just--<br> just speaking the melody,<br> - not-- not singing it.<br> - Not singing?<br> - Great.<br> - You sure?<br> Oh yeah.<br> Okay. Ahem.<br> I didn't know you.<br> You didn't know me.<br> - But now I can see you.<br> - You see what I see.<br> - Now you're inside me...<br> - And I'm inside you...<br> -...and I'm inside you.<br> -...and you're inside me.<br> - I sit here with her...<br> - I sit here with him.<br> ...and I'm thinking of you<br> and you're thinking of me.<br> And when we're together,<br> we know they're alone.<br> - Not really alone.<br> - They're not really alone.<br> - We know they're together...<br> - Like the earth and a stone.<br> -...like a dog and a bone.<br> - But I don't care.<br> And I care less, 'cause<br> my hand's in yours.<br> And it's touching my dress.<br> Take me home, please.<br> You've got me all emotional.<br> Take me home, please.<br> You've got me all emotional.<br> Please don't take my piano player.<br> Well, for the record,<br> - he's my piano player.<br> - Well, for the record,<br> - he's my piano player.<br> - I like to think<br> I'm everybody's piano player.<br> - We know they're together...<br> - Like the earth and a stone.<br> -...like a dog and a bone.<br> - But I don't care.<br> And I care less,<br> 'cause my hand's in yours.<br> And it's touching my dress.<br> Watching Anita onstage,<br> I noticed something about her.<br> I mentioned this to Raymond.<br> I wouldn't say Anita's secretive.<br> Anita is secret.<br> Very much so.<br> - Like you.<br> - No.<br> No, I don't-- I don't think so.<br> Hmm.<br> Tyrone, though.<br> He-- he has this--<br> he has that thing too.<br> And you're right as usual, you know,<br> and there is something about Anita<br> that reminds me of-- of me.<br> But I like it. I mean, there's nothing<br> wrong with having a secret.<br> I hope I'm all right--<br> I mean for this.<br> No, you're always fine.<br> But Tyrone, though...<br> - You know, I have to say--<br> - No, I mean there's just something--<br> he has this really sweet voice<br> and he's just very protective of me.<br> And then I heard birds.<br> And the piano again.<br> I thought I heard someone say<br> "What's she doing that's so strange?"<br> It might've been Anita's voice.<br> I was in a field<br> under a tree.<br> I could see a man and a woman.<br> I dreamt that I was writing a story<br> about a man who followed me<br> and watched me,<br> even when I was sleeping.<br> I put his hands on my breasts,<br> and our lips touched.<br> He is touching my thigh<br> under my skirt.<br> Higher.<br> He's staring at me.<br> - Martine.<br> - I can hear him.<br> Martine.<br> - Huh?<br> - I can hear his footsteps.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> You were mumbling.<br> - Oh. Really?<br> - Yeah, you were dreaming.<br> I was dreaming<br> that I was writing a story.<br> We should go.<br> - The new pages?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> I was being followed.<br> Followed when?<br> In the dream, in the story.<br> I put his hand on my breast<br> and our lips touched.<br> It was just a dream.<br> Something was happening to me.<br> Oh God.<br> New pages.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Julie.<br> Thanks.<br> - Raymond.<br> - Hmm?<br> I-- I know it's a whisper,<br> but I'm gonna need to hear it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's just tricky.<br> So can you take it from that line again?<br> Um, what do you mean?<br> She's acting more and more strange.<br> I think she must know<br> and she doesn't know what to do.<br> So she's, you know--<br> what is she doing that's so strange?<br> - Again.<br> - What again?<br> That line-- read it again.<br> I think she must know<br> and she doesn't know what to do,<br> so she's, you know--<br> what is she doing that's so strange?<br> And then I saw Anita watching me.<br> What is she doing that's so strange?<br> She's watching me,<br> - all the time.<br> - Raymond.<br> She's watching me, all the time.<br> - Stand closer.<br> - Like-- you--<br> - Clo-- closer than this?<br> - Yeah.<br> Please, closer.<br> She's--<br> she's watching me, all the time.<br> Like when I'm just reading, or even...<br> I don't remember that scene<br> in the play ending.<br> Everyone was just quiet.<br> That night,<br> Raymond was out late.<br> I had a headache for two days,<br> so I looked for some aspirin.<br> I couldn't find any.<br> The next morning,<br> I went to meet a journalist I knew.<br> - Martine.<br> - Oh. Hi, Elizabeth.<br> You looked like<br> you were somewhere else.<br> Yeah.<br> - How are you?<br> - I'm-- I'm pretty good.<br> It's good to see you.<br> God, how long has it been?<br> - What, like--<br> - Well, let me see.<br> I-- the last piece I did on you was<br> January-- two years ago.<br> As she spoke,<br> it occurred to me that<br> I had no idea who she was.<br> I had recognized her name<br> when she called,<br> but I couldn't remember<br> ever seeing her before.<br> Like last time,<br> I'm just gonna record it.<br> - That's okay?<br> - That-- that's fine.<br> Okay.<br> Interview with Martine Jamison,<br> May 11th.<br> She wanted to know about the new play.<br> So it's-- it's a workshop, so-- so--<br> so things-- things change.<br> Everything is still trying to change.<br> It wouldn't surprise me if...<br> Um, same group that I--<br> same group that<br> I've worked with before,<br> plus Tyrone Devlin has joined us.<br> - I don't know him.<br> - Oh, he works a lot, I think.<br> He's-- he's really very good.<br> Um, very good.<br> Why would I poison her?<br> You tell me.<br> You're deluded.<br> There's, um,<br> a festival in Japan that...<br> There's, um,<br> a festival in Japan that...<br> really interests me.<br> Some people write letters to the dead.<br> And when you write a letter<br> to someone who has died--<br> And when you write<br> a letter to someone who has died--<br> in Japan, they put it<br> in this little wooden boat<br> and it drifts off.<br> So has the person<br> who's written the letter<br> spoken to the dead?<br> - I think maybe, you know--<br> - I mean, I'd say yes.<br> I mean, I'd say yes.<br> Their-- their minds,<br> through the letters,<br> en-- enter...<br> um, a world that's not living.<br> But the mind is alive if<br> and only if their writing is sincere.<br> And in this way--<br> and in this way,<br> that world-- the dead world--<br> is brought into life and it--<br> and so-- so it lives. Um...<br> I'm thinking of a new element.<br> - For the play?<br> - Yeah, for the play.<br> Do you know what<br> copper supplements are used for?<br> No, I don't.<br> Well,<br> copper is a--<br> it's present in the body.<br> It's an element.<br> You actually need it<br> for your body to function,<br> so people take copper supplements.<br> But if you take too much,<br> it-- it can--<br> If you take too much,<br> it can lead to schizophrenia.<br> I didn't know that.<br> Yeah, it's clinically been known<br> to lead to schizophrenia.<br> Yeah. Well, it's--<br> it's kind of a--<br> a specialized kind--<br> kind of knowledge.<br> I'm changing the names<br> of the characters in the play<br> to be the names of the actors--<br> the actual actors playing them.<br> I didn't want her to look at me anymore.<br> You know what? I, uh--<br> I have this headache.<br> Do you think<br> we could finish this later?<br> Tomo-- maybe tomorrow even?<br> Of course.<br> Can I get you anything?<br> No no.<br> That's very kind.<br> I'm just, uh-- I--<br> I'll call you and we can<br> figure out a time.<br> Thank you for understanding.<br> I'm sorry about this.<br> Um, bye.<br> As you know,<br> I continued to write the play.<br> You've all been, uh,<br> really patient with the new pages.<br> So thank you.<br> It's very helpful to me.<br> Wow. What happened?<br> - All the songs are out?<br> - Yeah.<br> And your characters have new names.<br> I'm sort of losing my bearings here.<br> It's like an entirely different play.<br> Yeah, well,<br> that's the idea of a workshop--<br> things change.<br> I know that's the idea, Tyrone.<br> - Good.<br> - I mean, we're just simply--<br> just gonna see what happens.<br> You know, see where it goes.<br> Yeah, that sounds good to me.<br> Yeah, so...<br> see where-- where it takes us.<br> - Great. That's-- that's fine.<br> - Okay.<br> Thanks, guys.<br> You're deluded.<br> Or maybe you're not.<br> Maybe you're using<br> this accusation to mask<br> some sickness of your own.<br> It's pathetic.<br> That happens, you know.<br> Why would I poison her?<br> I don't know, Raymond. Why?<br> Go to hell.<br> Uh, can you take<br> that again, Raymond?<br> - It happens, you know.<br> - No, from "You're deluded."<br> And you know<br> that he knows that you're lying.<br> Oh, I wasn't so sure that I was lying.<br> You are, and he knows you are.<br> So--<br> I don't know, that's--<br> that's kinda going<br> a long way from a flirtation.<br> Now I'm poisoning my wife?<br> I mean-- I--<br> I don't mean to be rude.<br> I just-- I just don't know,<br> but I think it's interesting.<br> All right.<br> You're deluded.<br> Or maybe you're not.<br> Maybe you're using this accusation<br> to mask some sickness of your own.<br> - I'm don't-- I don't get this.<br> - It's pathetic.<br> Go to hell.<br> No, Raymond, you go to hell.<br> Okay.<br> Yeah, let's take--<br> take five minutes.<br> Raymond, can I talk<br> to you for a sec?<br> Why are you taking so much copper?<br> What do you mean?<br> You have about 20 bottles<br> of copper in your gym bag.<br> I don't have any... copper.<br> You know-- you know that.<br> Why are you saying that?<br> Raymond, I-- I saw it.<br> It's in your gym bag.<br> I saw it.<br> Sweetheart,<br> I don't have any copper. I...<br> I just don't get it.<br> I just want you to tell me the truth.<br> - That's all.<br> - Just in case you're wondering,<br> I don't mind if you<br> go through my stuff.<br> Just in case you're wondering.<br> Like a curtain had been pulled back,<br> I could suddenly see what was<br> really happening on the stage.<br> I don't like being so close<br> to you and having to pretend.<br> I know.<br> She's listening to us right now.<br> I can feel it.<br> I know you could see it too.<br> You're using this accusation<br> to mask some perversion<br> of your own.<br> It's pathetic.<br> It happens you know.<br> It's not very original,<br> - if that's what you're doing.<br> - It's not what I'm doing.<br> I didn't expect to find you here.<br> I think everybody could see it.<br> Hello.<br> I came early.<br> Is that all right?<br> - Who didn't you expect?<br> - Me.<br> We were just picking<br> a suitcase for you to take.<br> Mmm. Is everything okay?<br> Sure, why not?<br> Uh, oh, in case you're wondering,<br> no, I don't--<br> I don't mind, yeah,<br> if you go through my things.<br> It's fine. Just in case<br> you were wondering.<br> - So, ready to go?<br> - No, I can't go today.<br> - My-- my wrist--<br> - It's still hurting?<br> - A little bit.<br> - Yeah.<br> Maybe you should take<br> something for it.<br> No, I don't like to.<br> - Oh.<br> - I'll just rest it awhile longer,<br> - just to be sure.<br> - Good.<br> All right, well,<br> maybe I'll just go by myself.<br> Are you, uh,<br> two gonna be okay here together?<br> Are you sure?<br> Yeah, I'm-- I'm sure, I'm sure.<br> Uh, could I just,<br> um, uh--<br> Martine, do you think<br> Raymond should stand over by me?<br> Just so we can, you know,<br> like, face Tyrone together<br> - or-- because--<br> - Sure. Why not?<br> I'll just get my things.<br> I'll just get<br> my things.<br> - Should I drive him?<br> - Hey, Anita.<br> Raymond wants you closer to him.<br> I thought I-- that's okay.<br> Okay.<br> And Tyrone comes back in.<br> Okay then.<br> You know,<br> I think I'm gonna take off.<br> Hey, don't leave on my account.<br> He's not.<br> I should get home anyway.<br> - My wife's expecting me.<br> - Yeah well,<br> maybe you should take<br> something for that wrist.<br> Bye.<br> Oh, Julie, hi.<br> No, all by myself.<br> Just woke up from a nap.<br> Nope, just me.<br> Okay, bye.<br> All right.<br> Good.<br> Um, Tyrone.<br> It's good,<br> like, you're aware<br> of what they're doing.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> It's like you know<br> what they're doing behind your back.<br> Whatever that is.<br> Uh-huh.<br> But you don't confront them,<br> 'cause you don't need to.<br> Yeah, I'm-I'm--<br> I'm taunting them.<br> - Right.<br> - I feel taunted.<br> Interesting.<br> - Why?<br> - That you feel taunted.<br> - Why is that interesting, Martine?<br> - I think it's interesting.<br> That you feel taunted,<br> that you would choose that word.<br> Why is that interesting?<br> I don't-- I mean I--<br> - Just that--<br> - I didn't choose that word.<br> Tyrone chose that word.<br> Yeah. Yeah, I guess--<br> I guess he did.<br> Sorry, did you say<br> something, Raymond?<br> No.<br> I'm-- no.<br> I just-- I didn't--<br> what did you say?<br> Wh-- what?<br> I didn't say anything.<br> I thought you--<br> what did you say?<br> Oh, I thought I heard<br> you say something.<br> - What? You didn't say anything?<br> - N-- no.<br> What did--<br> what did you think I said?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know what you said.<br> Oh boy.<br> Uh, right.<br> Maybe we should take a break.<br> Yeah. You know, I'm--<br> I don't know.<br> I'm a little tired.<br> And, uh, look,<br> you guys, I--<br> I know we just got here,<br> but I-I-I-- I think I'm--<br> just need to call it a night.<br> But please<br> just, uh, continue<br> working without me.<br> I-- I just--<br> Do you need something?<br> No no no, I'm-- I just--<br> I just need to get home.<br> Just continue doing<br> what you're doing.<br> Uh, yeah. Huh.<br> I am-- I'm really confused<br> about the-- this--<br> You know, you and Raymond<br> figure it out.<br> Maybe you can direct for a while, Anita.<br> Fuck you.<br> Do you think<br> she's gonna be all right?<br> I don't know.<br> What do you think?<br> You know her best.<br> Listen.<br> I know you're friends<br> with Tyrone, but...<br> have you noticed<br> the way he is with Martine?<br> Noticed what?<br> - What, Raymond?<br> - Yeah, I just--<br> I can't figure him out.<br> Well, he's strange.<br> So what?<br> So nothing, I guess.<br> Hi, I'm Detective Roberts.<br> This is Detective Abrams.<br> Are you the Martine Jamison<br> that was interviewed yesterday<br> - by Elizabeth Holladay?<br> - Yeah.<br> The next morning I woke up alone.<br> - Can we come in?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> Elizabeth Holladay was struck<br> by a car yesterday<br> just after you two spoke.<br> Oh my God.<br> Um, how is she?<br> She's not doing that well.<br> She's in a coma at St. Vincent's.<br> She's in critical condition.<br> Oh. My God.<br> I-- I didn't know her that well.<br> - She was just--<br> - If it's okay,<br> I'd like to ask you just<br> a couple of questions.<br> - Um, It was a hit and run...<br> - Oh.<br> ...so we're trying<br> to see if we can't make<br> some progress toward<br> identifying the driver.<br> It's just a few questions.<br> - Sure.<br> - Umm...<br> she had a tape player<br> running in her purse<br> when she was hit.<br> We hear some voices in it<br> and I just--<br> I wonder<br> if you can recognize this voice.<br> I'll call you and we can--<br> Sorry.<br> That's me.<br> She answered a cellphone call<br> just before the accident.<br> Hello? Oh, hi.<br> No, she just left.<br> She said she wasn't feeling well.<br> She mentioned you--<br> about the new piece.<br> Yeah, and...<br> Oh God.<br> Oh my God.<br> She mentioned you-- about the new piece.<br> Yeah, and the theater.<br> That voice, the man--<br> - you recognize it?<br> - No. Who is it?<br> It may have been the voice<br> of someone in the car.<br> We don't know.<br> I have no-- I-I-- I don't know.<br> I'm sorry. I--<br> All right.<br> If you can think of anything--<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you for your time.<br> And then one day, you and I--<br> I think it was us--<br> had a talk in your apartment.<br> And you said that you liked<br> - that most people couldn't see you.<br> - That's weird.<br> - I think it was us.<br> - No, it's not.<br> Yeah, it is, actually, a little.<br> Hey, there's Raymond.<br> Is Martine with him?<br> No.<br> Hey, d-- don't.<br> I don't know what your problem<br> with him is.

I didn't expect<br> to find you here.<br> But I am.<br> - Anita.<br> - Yes?<br> Nothing.<br> Are you ready?<br> - No, I'm not going.<br> - Oh.<br> I'm staying here with Anita.<br> I hope you don't mind.<br> Anita.<br> Anita.<br> You keep saying that.<br> Martine, I'm a little lost.<br> I'm sorry, guys.<br> It just-- I don't-- I don't--<br> I don't know what I'm doing.<br> - What the fuck?<br> - Well, you're not...<br> Is it supposed to be this cruel though?<br> I mean, that's what it feels like.<br> That's-- that's what you want?<br> What do you think, Anita?<br> I mean it depends<br> on what you think is cruel.<br> What do you think is cruel?<br> I'd be interested to know.<br> I-- I just asked you.<br> I asked you.<br> Raymond?<br> I didn't ask Raymond.<br> I asked you.<br> - Julie, do you understand?<br> - Martine, what are you doing?<br> Yeah.<br> Are you all right?<br> Yeah, let me just think.<br> He thinks that she's watching him<br> when she's asleep.<br> I know, but--<br> Maybe she's awake.<br> Maybe she's not sleeping at all.<br> Raymond?<br> Any thoughts, Raymond?<br> Raymond, any--<br> any thoughts on that?<br> Martine, I think you're being cruel.<br> Maybe I am.<br> I'm gonna take you home.<br> Well, I'm sorry.<br> Uh, I'm not feeling so well.<br> Raymond's gonna see me home.<br> Sorry.<br> You should have just told me.<br> Anita.<br> It's for you.<br> Just lay off for a second, okay?<br> She doesn't wanna talk.<br> Yeah, she's confused.<br> Yeah, she just fucked up rehearsal.<br> One night<br> I saw a woman under a tree--<br> a whispering ash.<br> She was alone<br> but her skirt was raised.<br> I could see that<br> she had been touched<br> as I had been.<br> I feel like there's something<br> you want to say to me, Martine.<br> What?<br> I don't know.<br> If there's something<br> you wanna say, say it.<br> I-- I think-- I think<br> we should talk later.<br> Forgive me, Anita.<br> Martine?<br> Martine?<br> Martine.<br> This is probably a mistake.<br> Well, you show things to Raymond<br> before they're finished, right?<br> Well...<br> Can I get you something?<br> No, I'm-I'm-- I'm good.<br> Maybe I'll just read this first part.<br> If you want.<br> "She lay on the bed in the quiet room.<br> Then something happened.<br> She could hear footsteps<br> in the hallway<br> coming closer.<br> The door didn't open,<br> but now the steps were in the room.<br> They stopped<br> and she could hear breathing.<br> And now she could see.<br> In the mirror in the corner behind her<br> at the edge of the bed,<br> a man watching her,<br> his shadow touching her skin.<br> She closed her eyes<br> and she could feel nothing<br> but the shadow of the man<br> touching her."<br> Who is this man?<br> What are you scared of?<br> I didn't say I was scared of anything.<br> Maybe you like<br> his shadow touching you.<br> I don't know what I like.<br> Hello.<br> Oh hi, Raymond.<br> Yeah, hold on one second.<br> Hello? Hi.<br> Um, okay.<br> Yeah, we're just finishing up.<br> Yeah, I'll see you in a few minutes.<br> So...<br> Tyrone called after you left.<br> He's worried about you.<br> He said that?<br> I don't trust him, not at all.<br> But yeah, that's what he said.<br> Um, I'm sorry that, you know,<br> this has been so scattered<br> and all the changes.<br> Is that what you think?<br> No.<br> - What's this?<br> - It's for later.<br> Okay.<br> Um, Raymond told me<br> that you were having some problems<br> with-- with the work.<br> Well, I don't know<br> why he would say that.<br> - Julie.<br> - Mmm?<br> - You ready?<br> - Yeah, I guess.<br> - Okay.<br> - Uh...<br> All right.<br> Hello? Oh, hi.<br> No, she just left.<br> She said she wasn't feeling well.<br> She mentioned you--<br> about the new piece.<br> Yeah, and...<br> Hey, leave her alone.<br> - No no no!<br> - Oh my God!<br> Just stop it! No no, don't!<br> Can I just sit down?<br> Hello.<br> You want help?<br> No. Um...<br> this is nice.<br> Please just stay with me.<br> You're-- you're so pretty.<br> You're so pretty.<br> Let's just stay here.<br> - Let's just be alone.<br> - No, lady. Please.<br> Let's-- no no no no no no.<br> It's okay. It's okay.<br> - Please.<br> - No.<br> Who are you?<br> - Please, lady. Please, lady.<br> - Who are you?!<br> - Don't scream.<br> - What did you do?!<br> What did you do to me?!<br> Oh my God!<br> What's going on?<br> Oh my God!<br> What did you do to me?! Oh my God!<br> - Just stay back.<br> - What did you do to me?!<br> What did you do to me?!<br> Oh no!<br> Oh no, no no no no!<br> - Oh no!<br> - What's going on here?<br> - No no no no.<br> - What did you do?<br> - Ma'am, you just need to stay back.<br> - No!<br> - Did he touch you? Are you okay?<br> - No no no.<br> - No no no!<br> - Try to calm down.<br> She won't tell me what's going on.<br> - No no!<br> - What's going--<br> - just-- just step back, ma'am.<br> - Let's go. No.<br> Her parents died<br> when she was really young.<br> They died in a car crash.<br> She's kind of secretive<br> in a way, I guess.<br> I don't know. I--<br> What happened to her?<br> "Write a letter to the dead.<br> Write it for the dead to read.<br> Oh the dead have swum too far.<br> They have swum beyond the sea.<br> Take the letter in your hand<br> Make a fold, and make a fold.<br> Make it into a little boat<br> And place a candle in the hold.<br> Let the paper boat float on<br> Where the river meets the sea.<br> That is where my heart belongs.<br> That is where I long to be.<br> Every candle is a star.<br> Every boat floats out to sea--<br> Which I think is not too far<br> And that is where I long to be.<br> And that is where I long to be."<br> One day<br> I noticed that<br> something was staring at me.<br> What was?<br> Is it possible<br> you just imagined--<br> Anything's possible.<br> Martine, do you think people<br> are out to get you?<br> I suppose I used to,<br> but, um...<br> I'm writing a story.<br> I wonder if you wanna hear it.<br> "Once there was this girl,<br> and she was very beautiful.<br> Not unlike you.<br> And one day<br> she woke up<br> and she realized<br> she had made a dreadful mistake."<br> That's it.<br> That's my story.<br> I wonder if you liked it.<br> Uh, no no, I, uh--<br> I didn't like it very much.<br> Well, I'm sorry<br> you didn't like my story.<br> Maybe I'll work on it<br> a little more.<br> Goodbye, Martine.<br> Thank you for the flowers.<br> They're beautiful.<br> I love you.<br> Be careful.<br> We're pretty sure she was exposed,<br> though I can't really say how,<br> to a catalyzed form of a leaf<br> of a tree found in Colombia.<br> It's called scopolamine.<br> The criminals use it<br> to break down the will<br> or the rational thoughts<br> of their victims.<br> They blow the powder<br> into their victim's face<br> like this, and the victim--<br> it's odorless, it's colorless.<br> How strange.<br> And while it's used medicinally<br> in very minute amounts<br> for a variety of conditions,<br> when it's combined with morphine,<br> it produces a state<br> called "twilight sleep."<br> It's also known<br> as a kind of truth serum.<br> It crosses the blood-brain barrier<br> and affects the central nervous system.<br> It's my guess that Martine's exposure<br> was at very small levels<br> but over a prolonged period.<br> "How" doesn't really matter, I suppose.<br> Unfortunately, the effect<br> of long-term exposure was--<br> well, there are obvious<br> neurological problems...<br> I worked more on my story,<br> the one that you read to me.<br> Here it is.<br> "I had begun walking<br> when it was still dark.<br> Now at midday,<br> when I was alone,<br> I sat under a tree--<br> a whispering ash.<br> And I felt a hand on my thigh.<br> A man was there, lying next to me,<br> touching my leg inside,<br> high above my knee under my skirt.<br> His hand moved higher, slowly.<br> I couldn't look at him,<br> but I felt his eyes on me.<br> And so I slept.<br> As I slept,<br> I dreamt that I wrote you this letter<br> and I put it in the sea."<br> Have a seat.<br> "And I heard now for the first time<br> the silver breath of wind<br> in the ash tree<br> whispering above me<br> as I saw the shadows<br> of the slender leaves<br> tremble against the skin on my leg,<br> high up where the skirt was raised<br> above the knee.<br> The shadows of the leaves<br> felt sweet on my skin<br> and I watched their soft movements,<br> touching me.<br> I felt the shadows across my skin<br> and I watched.<br> Love, Martine."<br>
