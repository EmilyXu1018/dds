                        It's no use, Emile.<br> The place is like a sieve.<br> It would take all the rags in Paris<br> to stuff half its holes.<br> Paris.<br> Vast. Motionless.<br> A gigantic mother brooding over her<br> millions of children, good and bad.<br> It's magnificent, Cezanne.<br> You must paint it.<br> As someday I shall write it.<br> No, Zola. It's hopeless.<br> You know that people don't want<br> to see the stark face of truth.<br> They would much prefer<br> perfumed lights like these.<br> They ought to be burned<br> like something unclean.<br> Why, Paul, that's splendid.<br> Why didn't you think of that before?<br> We shall have a fire!<br> - We could sell them and...<br> - What?<br> And expose others<br> to their stinking hypocrisies?<br> No, my friend. We'll burn them...<br> ...and let their lying pages<br> warm the bones of men of truth!<br> There we are.<br> Well, look at that. Even the old stove<br> rebels at the vile trash.<br> Close that window!<br> - You want me to catch cold?<br> - But we'll suffocate.<br> That'll be better than perishing<br> from a draft.<br> Oh, you and your drafts.<br> It's the concierge...<br> ...for the rent.<br> - He'll kick us into the street.<br> Don't let him in. Tell him I'm in bed.<br> Some horrible disease.<br> It's catching. Anything.<br> - Who is it?<br> - It's Emile's mother.<br> - Come in, Madame Zola.<br> - Thanks, Paul.<br> Emile, why are you in bed?<br> Are you ill?<br> It's tearing my heart out to see you<br> living like this, and now it must end.<br> Nonsense, Maman. I'm an<br> independent gentleman of letters...<br> ...and soon the world will recognize me.<br> Cezanne?<br> - Alexandrine, come in.<br> - Alexandrine, here? Where?<br> Alexandrine! Darling.<br> Oh, darling, we have<br> wonderful news for you.<br> - You have a job.<br> - You have a job.<br> A job?<br> I have a job?<br> Cezanne! Did you hear? I have a job!<br> What kind of job?<br> I'm not going to sell my talents<br> to any lying...<br> This is a job with La Rue,<br> the great book publisher.<br> You're to be a clerk. Oh, darling,<br> we can get married now.<br> That's marvelous!<br> Now I shall have time to finish my book.<br> Maybe even get La Rue to publish it.<br> Cezanne, take Maman's coat.<br> Paul, get meat and bread!<br> - What is it?<br> - Emile, I hate to trouble you like this...<br> ...but the butcher refuses us<br> any more credit.<br> - You told him we'd settle at month's end.<br> - But he wants it now.<br> And the landlord was very nasty<br> about the rent again this morning.<br> - Couldn't you ask for another advance?<br> - I've already had two advances this month.<br> - You're wanted in the office right away.<br> - Yes.<br> I'll do whatever I can.<br> Don't worry, dear.<br> This is the agent of police.<br> He has something to say.<br> Do you have a book called<br> The Confessions of Claude?<br> - Yes.<br> - The public prosecutor is highly displeased.<br> - Why?<br> - It is a bad book.<br> - Badly written?<br> - It is an offensive book.<br> - It will do great harm to public morals.<br> - Keep quiet.<br> We've been watching your writings,<br> young man.<br> You're a troublemaker. Your articles,<br> attacking our leading men of letters...<br> ...the arts, criticizing the civic authorities.<br> Perhaps there's something<br> better for me to criticize?<br> I don't want any of your impudence.<br> You've got to stop it.<br> This is an official warning.<br> - I hope I won't have to come here again.<br> - You realize, monsieur...<br> ...that his book was not published by me.<br> But it was written by your employee.<br> That makes you responsible under the law.<br> - Well.<br> - I didn't mean to get you into trouble.<br> Why do you write such muckraking stuff<br> when there are many pleasant things in life?<br> And many unpleasant things.<br> That's not your business while you work<br> for me. I should discharge you...<br> ...but I'll give you one more chance.<br> - Thank you.<br> But from now on, you will tend strictly<br> to your work and stop writing trash.<br> - What? Is that a bad exchange for a job?<br> - A very bad exchange, Monsieur La Rue.<br> Here is your pay<br> up to the end of the month.<br> Get out.<br> - I'm very grateful to you.<br> - What?<br> For allowing me to devote<br> all my time to my writing.<br> Then go ahead with your scribbling.<br> And maybe a lean stomach<br> will teach you better!<br> But a fat stomach sticks out too far,<br> Monsieur La Rue.<br> It prevents you from seeing<br> what's going on around you.<br> While you grow fatter and richer<br> publishing your nauseating confectionary...<br> ...I shall become a mole,<br> digging here, rooting there.<br> Stirring up the whole rotten mess<br> where life is hard, raw and ugly.<br> You will not like the smell of my books.<br> Neither will the public prosecutor.<br> But when the stench is strong enough,<br> maybe something will be done about it.<br> Good day!<br> You there! Hold on!<br> - Hold on!<br> - Stop yelling and let us sleep.<br> A woman just jumped into the river.<br> She's better off than all of these.<br> - Why weren't the safety doors closed?<br> - Safety doors?<br> - They don't waste money on safety doors.<br> - Hey, you!<br> Get away from here and stay away.<br> It is true. All these things are true.<br> I saw them with my own eyes.<br> Print this about the uproar<br> in the Chamber of Deputies.<br> The military clique howling Clemenceau<br> down because he told them that...<br> ...the army was honeycombed with graft and<br> warned them not to provoke the Prussians.<br> I should bother.<br> They're only space-fillers at best.<br> I'll give you 10 franc for the lot.<br> Take it or leave it.<br> - But, monsieur, l...<br> - Ten franc.<br> Cecile! Antoinette! The police!<br> - Come on, get in there!<br> - Come on, get in here!<br> Out, out, out.<br> Quick.<br> Sit here.<br> - The...<br> - Come along, you.<br> Sit still. This lady's with us.<br> - Leave her alone.<br> - Then what is her name?<br> I tell you, the lady is our friend.<br> You have no right.<br> You are very clever, all of you,<br> but we'll meet again.<br> Have something with us.<br> - Me?<br> - Yes.<br> Cognac.<br> Are your eyes on sticks, then,<br> that they pop out so far?<br> Tell me, what is your name?<br> Satin in this district,<br> Lucille in Montmartre...<br> ...and in Montparnasse,<br> I'm Georgette or Madeleine.<br> Does it matter?<br> Why do you ask? What do you want?<br> I have nothing.<br> We have something in common, then.<br> - What?<br> - Nothing.<br> But your accent isn't Parisian.<br> - Where are you from?<br> - From Artois.<br> Hedin.<br> - And I wish I was back there.<br> - Well, perhaps someday you can go home.<br> Me? Go home?<br> Look at me.<br> I can never go home.<br> And I hate Paris.<br> Cold and wet. Hunted like an animal.<br> Starved. Beaten by the police.<br> It's dirty, beastly. I hate it!<br> - Well?<br> - When did you first come to Paris?<br> A hundred years ago, when I was 17.<br> You should've seen me then.<br> I was lovely.<br> Of course, I'm not bad now...<br> ...if you look quick<br> and there's not too much light.<br> You're charming.<br> I was lovely then, really lovely.<br> - I wish I could tell you about it.<br> - Why don't you?<br> So you see...<br> ...he was not to blame either.<br> There was just nothing else for me to do.<br> Mademoiselle?<br> Mademoiselle Nana?<br> - How did you know my name?<br> - Why, it's written here.<br> - What do you want, then?<br> - Why didn't he...?<br> Oh, don't ask me any more questions.<br> Take all this stuff. All!<br> All but this.<br> - The child, what happened to her?<br> - She died.<br> Convent Saint Marie...<br> ...if it's any of your business.<br> Emile.<br> Emile.<br> Paul, where's that sketch<br> you made of her?<br> That's magnificent. And a pencil.<br> That's what I'll call my book.<br> - Have you everything you want, my dear?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, I forgot. I want a copy of Nana.<br> One doesn't read such books.<br> It's not proper.<br> Madame.<br> Madame, your umbrella.<br> Thank you. And send me<br> a copy of Nana to my address.<br> I certainly will.<br> How about a nice new umbrella,<br> monsieur?<br> I can sell you a beauty for 2 franc, 50.<br> And lose the privilege<br> of arguing with my old friend?<br> No, thank you.<br> Umbrella! Umbrella!<br> - Is Monsieur Charpentier in?<br> - Yes. Jean?<br> - Yes?<br> - Monsieur Zola is here.<br> - Zola.<br> - Monsieur Charpentier, l...<br> I... Well, I have a favor to ask.<br> Monsieur Zola has a favor to ask.<br> And what is this favor, Monsieur Zola?<br> It's quite unusual...<br> ...but could you advance me a few franc<br> on Nana? I'm sure it will sell, monsieur.<br> Monsieur Zola wishes the advance of a few<br> franc because he is sure Nana will sell.<br> Isn't that magnificent?<br> You write a book about the gutter,<br> you call it Nana...<br> ...and you hope to make a little money.<br> Come with me.<br> I have just finished stamping<br> and addressing it to you.<br> Well, open it and read.<br> "Nana sells 36,000...<br> ...the first three days..."?<br> "Enclosed find check..."<br> For 18,000 francs?<br> Yes, well...<br> Why, I can't believe it. It's...<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much. I don't know how<br> to thank you. Adieu. Goodbye.<br> Goodbye, monsieur.<br> Goodbye, madame.<br> - Monsieur?<br> - Yes, what is it?<br> Could you...? Could you still<br> let me have a few franc? In cash.<br> I'll pay you back tomorrow.<br> Thank you, monsieur.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Thank you, madame. Thank you.<br> - Umbrella!<br> - Yes, of course. I'll have a dozen.<br> I'll have two doz...<br> No, I'll have one. Here.<br> - There you are.<br> - Umbrella!<br> New umbrella! Umbrella!<br> - Where are they going?<br> - To Berlin.<br> - Berlin?<br> - Haven't you heard? War's been declared.<br> Isn't it glorious?<br> Those dreadful Prussians,<br> at the very gates of Paris.<br> There, there, Maman. Don't take on so.<br> We'll all be murdered in our beds.<br> It's disgraceful.<br> There's not a morsel of food<br> to be bought anywhere in the whole town.<br> Even the horseflesh has been sold out.<br> And the streets...<br> It's frightening, terrifying.<br> Never did I think I'd live to see France...<br> ...groveling in the dust<br> under the Prussian heel.<br> - How will it end, Emile?<br> - How does it always end?<br> In misery, suffering,<br> in the blood of the people.<br> Those generals plunged us recklessly<br> into a war for which we were unprepared.<br> Is it any wonder that we were<br> disastrously defeated?<br> - Those are the fortunes of war.<br> - Those are indeed the fortunes of war.<br> The whole structure had to collapse<br> before we could learn the truth.<br> But France shall know why.<br> I shall name her betrayers.<br> She shall see who led her men<br> to the slaughter...<br> ...who's responsible for her downfall.<br> "During the entire war of 1870...<br> ...the execution of the campaign<br> was lame, impotent...<br> ...and nullified by petty jealousies<br> among the generals...<br> ...each of whom thought only of securing<br> a field marshal's baton for himself.<br> The army was governed by<br> dry rot and slow paralysis.<br> The general staff was mediocre,<br> of an ignorance past belief...<br> ...rushing into the adventure<br> of war with the confusion...<br> ...of a flock of sheep<br> being led to the shambles."<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> What is it? You seem disturbed.<br> Have you read the attack on the general<br> staff in this book, The Downfall?<br> Book? Book? I never read books.<br> Who's it by?<br> A certain Emile Zola.<br> A civilian daring to criticize the army.<br> He wasn't exactly criticizing, sir.<br> I've read the book.<br> The war has been over for many years,<br> but I've gathered, as Zola says...<br> ...there were times in that campaign<br> when our staffwork wasn't brilliant.<br> - What?<br> - We should admit our mistakes.<br> The army does not<br> make mistakes, Picquart...<br> ...and it will not tolerate<br> civilian criticism.<br> I suggest that you see<br> the chief censor about this book.<br> Tell him the army demands<br> the punishment of this upstart.<br> Chief censor, over there.<br> - Monsieur.<br> - Mr. Zola...<br> ...I sent for you because every book<br> you've written has caused trouble.<br> You attacked the Second Empire.<br> You attacked the Third Republic.<br> Germinal caused a furor and unrest<br> among the miners that lasted for years.<br> - Nana: Brutal, disgusting.<br> - But true.<br> All of them stirring France<br> to restlessness, angry passion.<br> And now this Downfall,<br> attacking our army.<br> The army heads are furious.<br> Such a book makes the whole country<br> lose confidence and respect.<br> Lose confidence in inefficiency?<br> Lose respect for cowardice and stupidity?<br> - That would be a pity, monsieur.<br> - You'll write no more such books.<br> Except, perhaps, one about the rascality<br> of army-ridden politicians.<br> That's an idea.<br> To expose the government itself...<br> ...with as much truth and accuracy<br> as I put into The Downfall.<br> - A book that would show...<br> - No, no. I mean...<br> ...you're a reasonable man,<br> Monsieur Zola.<br> We only want to do<br> what we think is best for our country.<br> You will do what is best for yourself...<br> ...by leaving me strictly alone<br> to write what I please, as I please.<br> Good day, monsieur.<br> That's the funniest thing I've...<br> It's good to be together again, Paul.<br> Just like old times.<br> Old times.<br> Oh, Paul, I want you to see the pearls<br> Emile bought for me when we were in Italy.<br> - Albert.<br> - Yes, monsieur?<br> Make certain that all the windows<br> are tightly shut.<br> - Emile, Emile. Still afraid of drafts.<br> - My chest, you know.<br> Oh, your chest is as strong as a barrel.<br> It always was.<br> Paul, I've always... You know, l...<br> I want to show you something.<br> Look at this priceless bit of woodcarving.<br> I picked it up at Lodi,<br> an extraordinary piece of craftsmanship.<br> And... Oh, now I have a real<br> rare treat for you.<br> I have something here that<br> you may have traveled the world over...<br> ...and never have found its like.<br> This will simply leave you breathless.<br> This most exquisite majolica.<br> I chanced upon it in a little,<br> out-of-the-way shop in Venice.<br> The work on this...<br> - Won't you sit down, Paul?<br> - No, I must go.<br> - It's goodbye.<br> - Goodbye?<br> Yes. I'm going south,<br> back to the country.<br> You can't do that, man.<br> Why, Paris is the very center...<br> Paris isn't for me any longer.<br> Come, Paul.<br> We're old friends.<br> Out with it. What is it?<br> - You really want me to tell you?<br> - Why, of course.<br> You're wealthy now, world-famous...<br> ...a member of the Legion of Honor.<br> You've come a long way from the days<br> when we starved together in an attic.<br> And you shouted:<br> "Burn the books of the hypocrites,<br> the shams...<br> ...and let their lying pages<br> warm the bones of a man of truth."<br> Sometimes I'm tempted to give in<br> and paint for...<br> No, Emile.<br> An artist should remain poor.<br> Otherwise his talent, like his stomach,<br> grows fat and stuffy.<br> I am sorry, Emile, but I had to say it.<br> You're my oldest and my dearest friend.<br> - I couldn't go without telling you this.<br> - Paul.<br> Won't you stay?<br> I need someone to remind me<br> of the old, struggling, carefree days...<br> ...fighting for a foothold.<br> You can never go back to it,<br> and I've never left it.<br> Paul.<br> - Will you write?<br> - No.<br> But I'll remember.<br> - What's the matter, dear? Tired?<br> - No, no. Just thinking.<br> Cezanne's gone.<br> - Back to Provence.<br> - Yes, I know. I met him in the hall.<br> - You didn't quarrel?<br> - Quarrel? With Cezanne?<br> But he's taken something of me with him.<br> - The last of my youth.<br> - Oh, rubbish.<br> He said I was getting too famous<br> and too fat.<br> Well, what if I have?<br> I've fought my battles. I want calm, rest.<br> - From now on, I could look only backward.<br> - That's just idle talk.<br> Come, let's play a game of piquet.<br> Strange, isn't it?<br> Paul and I.<br> Well, life is tricky.<br> And I suppose we don't influence<br> our fate.<br> While we're playing piquet,<br> a starving mother and child...<br> ...jump into the River Seine.<br> A servant forgets to extinguish a stove...<br> ...and someone suffocates.<br> Who knows whose fate<br> may intermingle with ours.<br> Or when.<br> A shot is fired.<br> A letter is written.<br> - Rene, lay out my civilian suit at once.<br> - Very good, commandant.<br> Monsieur.<br> I want to see the military attach?<br> Colonel von Schwartzkoppen.<br> Sorry, His Excellency went to Berlin,<br> but he'll be back tonight.<br> - I'll leave this letter for him.<br> - Very good, monsieur.<br> - What is it?<br> - Look.<br> - Colonel von Schwartzkoppen?<br> - The German military attach? Interesting.<br> - The commandant should see this.<br> - Now, wait a minute.<br> What do you think of this?<br> Outrageous.<br> This should be examined<br> by the chief of intelligence.<br> Excuse me, colonel.<br> This is inconceivable.<br> We must show it to the war minister.<br> Gentlemen, come with me.<br> I think that will be all, gentlemen.<br> - Pardon me, general.<br> - Yes?<br> This is most urgent.<br> - It's a bordereau.<br> - Yes.<br> A list of our secret documents.<br> "I am sending you..." What's this?<br> "Notes on the 120 mm gun,<br> new plan on covering troops...<br> ...changes in artillery formation,<br> Madagascar expedition...<br> ...a new shooting manual for field artillery,<br> very difficult to procure.<br> I am about to leave for the..."<br> This accounts for the leakage<br> in army information.<br> - How did we get it?<br> - The usual channels, sir.<br> Our agent procured it<br> at the German embassy.<br> Well, gentlemen, the man who wrote this<br> is our traitor.<br> Now...<br> ...who is it?<br> - He must be on the general staff, sir.<br> - One of us?<br> - Absurd.<br> Impossible.<br> Well, let's have a look at this roster<br> of staff officers.<br> "Record of officers...<br> Aaron D'Aboville." It's not you, I suppose,<br> D'Aboville, is it?<br> - I'll swear it's not, sir.<br> - Marvelous.<br> - It's like a confounded novel.<br> - "Aaron Cedibini."<br> No, no, no.<br> "Dreyfus."<br> - You found something, colonel?<br> - I was just wondering about Esterhazy.<br> Ferdinand, Count Walsin-Esterhazy.<br> He's a foreigner.<br> - A foreigner?<br> - Yes.<br> He's of Hungarian descent.<br> But his father was a general<br> in the French army.<br> Besides, Esterhazy's an infantry officer.<br> The man who wrote that is a gunner.<br> Gunner.<br> How about this fellow here?<br> "Dreyfus, Alfred."<br> I wonder how he ever became<br> a member of the general staff.<br> That's our man.<br> Sandherr, take action on it at once.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Commandant, send a message to Dreyfus<br> to report here first thing Monday morning.<br> Yes, general.<br> - Papa, the enemy advances.<br> - All right, fire.<br> - Don't forget, Maman, when the guns fire...<br> - I won't, dear.<br> - Wait, I'm not ready.<br> - Hurry, or your battalions will be repulsed.<br> Oh, not the French battalions, Papa.<br> All right. Here it goes.<br> Come in.<br> - A messenger from the war ministry.<br> - Show him in.<br> - Captain Dreyfus.<br> - Yes.<br> - A message for you, urgent.<br> - Thank you.<br> - What is it, dear?<br> - "Captain Dreyfus will present himself...<br> ...tomorrow morning, 9:00,<br> at the office of the chief of general staff.<br> Civilian dress."<br> Civilian dress?<br> You know,<br> one of those general inspections.<br> But at that hour.<br> Isn't that strange?<br> Always worried.<br> - Captain Dreyfus reporting, commandant.<br> - Yes.<br> Just a moment.<br> Oh, no, no, gentlemen.<br> Experience has proved...<br> ...that the 120 mm gun is...<br> Captain Dreyfus is waiting, sir.<br> - Seem upset?<br> - No, sir.<br> Evidently more of a scoundrel<br> than we thought.<br> Inform Commandant Dort.<br> He knows what to do.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Well, as I was saying...<br> ...the 120 mm gun<br> is the most serviceable...<br> - Captain Dreyfus is here.<br> - Oh, very good.<br> Hurry, Brucker.

I only...<br> - Repeat the last word.<br> "Note."<br> A note...<br> ...on the hydraulic brake...<br> ...of the 120 mm gun.<br> - Gun.<br> In the name of the law,<br> you're under arrest.<br> Arrest?<br> - On what charge?<br> - Treason.<br> But... But... This is outrageous!<br> I've devoted my entire life to the army<br> and you dare to...<br> Why, this is an insult!<br> Satisfied?<br> Perhaps you'll tell me the basis<br> of this charge against me.<br> Obstinate, aren't you,<br> pretending you don't know?<br> All I know is that I'm innocent.<br> Your handwriting speaks against you.<br> I've been instructed to offer you<br> the usual alternative.<br> No.<br> I'm not so obliging, nor so stupid<br> as to provide you with a perfect case.<br> I shall live to prove my innocence.<br> Take him away.<br> Jeanne, get Papa's slippers<br> and house jacket!<br> I've got them.<br> - There he is.<br> - Papa!

Why, how dare you.<br> - I'll call...<br> - You will call no one, madame.<br> You will serve your husband best<br> by being quiet and saying nothing.<br> If you don't, things will go badly for him.<br> Search the house.<br> Brucker.<br> - You'll find nothing.<br> - Your husband is very clever, madame.<br> My husband is innocent, monsieur.<br> Dreyfus found guilty!<br> Dreyfus found guilty!<br> - Dreyfus found guilty!<br> - What a fuss.<br> The whole country's in an uproar<br> over this Dreyfus.<br> Nice, fresh langoustes.<br> - Shall we get some?<br> - Shall we?

Smell this. Smell this.<br> Beautiful. We're having this bachelor and<br> his whole family for dinner. Will you come?<br> Kill the traitor, Dreyfus! Kill the traitor,<br> Dreyfus! Kill the traitor, Dreyfus!<br> Kill the traitor, Dreyfus!<br> Kill the traitor, Dreyfus!<br> Suppose Dreyfus is innocent, as he claims.<br> It would be too dreadful.<br> Impossible, madame.

It must not be.<br> But what about Dreyfus<br> rotting on Devil's Island?<br> Dreyfus, Dreyfus.<br> Will we never hear the last of the man?<br> Listen. If it is admitted<br> that a mistake has been made...<br> ...we, the general staff,<br> will be at the mercy...<br> ...of every scandal paper in France.<br> We owe it to the army to prevent that.<br> But you can't close a tomb<br> over a living man.<br> Can't we?

I can't...<br> What is this new proof<br> you say you have?<br> - A certain Colonel Picquart...<br> - Oh, that.<br> It was all in the papers.<br> Picquart came back from Africa...<br> ...and accused Esterhazy of writing<br> the bordereau.<br> Esterhazy was acquitted.<br> Of course he was. Acquitted by the same<br> army group that convicted my husband.<br> But don't you see?<br> They had to acquit Esterhazy...<br> ...to save the face of the general staff.<br> They'll stop at nothing...<br> ...to protect themselves,<br> even to sacrificing one of their own class.<br> That's fantastic. Childish, madame.<br> The general staff has more important work<br> to do than...<br> What do you mean,<br> "sacrificing one of their own class"?<br> Colonel Picquart has been arrested<br> and imprisoned in Mount Valerien.<br> They've arrested Picquart?<br> Well, why?<br> - What had he done?<br> - Nothing.<br> Nothing except speak the truth.<br> But, madame, we must deal in facts,<br> not irony.<br> I have all the facts, Monsieur Zola. Here.<br> These are letters written to Picquart<br> by the assistant chief of staff...<br> ...proving beyond doubt<br> that the general staff knows...<br> ...my husband is innocent<br> and Esterhazy is guilty.<br> Well, why weren't these used<br> in the Esterhazy court-martial?<br> Colonel Picquart's a good soldier.<br> He kept silent at the command<br> of his superiors.<br> You mean they knew...<br> ...and ordered him to suppress the truth?<br> Why, that's monstrous.<br> Oh, Monsieur Zola, you will help,<br> won't you?<br> How can anyone help you?<br> All France believes your husband guilty,<br> hates him as a traitor.<br> They would destroy any man<br> that would dare champion him.<br> There must be some way<br> to right this wrong.<br> Your husband's case is closed.<br> There's nothing that can be done.<br> Nothing.<br> Unless some fool were to publicly<br> accuse the general staff...<br> ...and get himself dragged into court<br> on a charge of libel.<br> Then, possibly, they would...<br> I've lived my life.<br> I've had enough of fighting...<br> ...turmoil, strife.

Give Brucker the signal.<br> Down with Zola!<br> Gentlemen, the court!<br> Military witnesses may be called...<br> ...provided the defense does not violate<br> their professional secrecy.<br> Attendant, conduct the witnesses<br> to their room.<br> - What about the Dreyfus case?<br> - Referencing it will not be allowed.<br> Mr. President,<br> if Dreyfus was justly condemned...<br> ...a full inquiry now would give<br> that condemnation increased weight...<br> ...and we would lose our case.<br> If the prosecution does not fear<br> what a reopening would reveal...<br> ...why does it not take<br> this easy means to defeat us?<br> You have heard the ruling of the court.<br> Who is your first witness?<br> Colonel Picquart.<br> Attendant,<br> call Colonel Picquart to the stand.<br> Colonel Picquart.<br> - Your name?<br> - Georges Picquart, Mr. President.<br> Take the oath.<br> Do you swear to tell the truth<br> without hatred or fear?<br> I swear.<br> What do you wish to ask the witness?<br> I'd like to ask him the circumstance<br> under which he first suspected...<br> ...that Esterhazy, and not Dreyfus,<br> was the author of the bordereau.<br> You have heard the question. Answer it.<br> In May 1896,<br> while I was chief of intelligence...<br> ...I received parts of a torn letter<br> addressed to Esterhazy...<br> ...from the representative<br> of a foreign power.<br> I obtained Esterhazy's letter<br> and compared it with the bordereau.<br> Both writings were Esterhazy's.<br> This was confirmed<br> by Esterhazy's banker.<br> I was convinced that Esterhazy<br> had written the bordereau.<br> I gave this proof of Esterhazy's guilt<br> to the general staff.<br> Was Esterhazy informed<br> that Colonel Picquart suspected him?<br> Naturally.<br> And the warning originated from a certain<br> intelligence officer of the general staff.<br> Stop!<br> You're lying!<br> Silence. Silence!<br> Now I will tell everything. I will tell<br> why I was sent to North Africa.<br> Gentlemen of the jury, I will tell why<br> men like Colonel Henry...<br> ...have made the most vile accusations<br> against me without proof.<br> Gentlemen, if you but knew why<br> all this is being done!<br> La patrie! La patrie!<br> You disgrace me!<br> Gentlemen! Well, I...<br> Silence. Silence!<br> - May I?<br> - Certainly, general.<br> The whole campaign of the defense<br> is extraordinary.<br> But the most deplorable spectacle of all to<br> me, as commander of the garrison of Paris...<br> ...is that of an officer still wearing<br> the French uniform...<br> ...who slanders his superiors<br> and his comrades.<br> - Long live the army!<br> - But not its generals!<br> Silence! Silence!<br> I cannot tolerate in silence<br> these accusations...<br> ...that the law was violated<br> by court-martial officers...<br> ...who shed their blood<br> on the battlefields of France...<br> ...while others stab her in the back.<br> Each serves his country<br> in his own way:<br> One with a sword,<br> the other with a pen.<br> Posterity will choose<br> between your name and mine.<br> I will not stand these insults to men<br> intent only on doing their duty!<br> Gentlemen of the jury,<br> it is outrageous, traitorous...<br> ...to deprive the army of confidence<br> in its chiefs in the day of danger!<br> And, believe me,<br> it is nearer than you think!<br> Gentlemen, it is your sons who will be<br> called on to defend France...<br> ...while Monsieur Zola will stay at home<br> and write a new Downfall.<br> He will continue to make France famous<br> throughout the world.<br> - A France that will have ceased to exist!<br> - Long live the army!<br> Bravo. Bravo. Well acted, general.<br> Although there is no war<br> nor danger of war...<br> ...you gave a very good performance.<br> But you did not utter a single word<br> to prove that Esterhazy was not guilty.<br> You cannot stop me from showing how he<br> tried to work on the sentiment of the jury!<br> I'll say what I have to say<br> if this trial lasts six months!<br> Monsieur Labori, address the court.<br> The general staff spoke as it pleased...<br> ...the commander of Paris<br> influenced the jury...<br> ...but the defense can say nothing.<br> Never has such a thing been seen.<br> What's your next question?<br> What is Colonel Picquart's<br> present address?<br> Mount Valerien fortress,<br> under military arrest.<br> Did he know that<br> by exposing Esterhazy...<br> ...he was jeopardizing his army career<br> and might end up in an army prison?<br> Not at first. I did later.<br> Did he know that by attempting<br> to secure justice for Dreyfus...<br> You cannot put that question.<br> The Dreyfus case is closed.<br> That heat.<br> Madame Dreyfus.<br> Quiet. Quiet!<br> - Your name, please.<br> - Lucie Dreyfus.<br> - Your occupation.<br> - Captain's wife.<br> Never mind.<br> What question do you wish to put?<br> Will she tell us<br> under what condition...<br> ...she learned from Commandant Dort<br> of her husband's arrest?<br> The question will not be put.<br> What was Dort's attitude<br> on that occasion?<br> Did he threaten her to say nothing<br> of what occurred?<br> The question will not be put.<br> Will she kindly tell us her opinion...<br> ...of the good faith of Zola<br> in bringing these charges?<br> That is irrelevant to this case.<br> The question will not be put.<br> I demand for my client the right granted<br> even to assassins and thieves:<br> To have my witnesses speak.<br> Questions relating<br> to a closed case are prohibited.<br> Madame Dreyfus,<br> you may leave the stand.<br> Mr. President, I protest!<br> They wouldn't let me speak<br> of my husband's innocence.<br> Not even a word of my gratitude<br> to Monsieur Zola.<br> My husband doesn't want to be thanked.<br> - Who will be your next witness?<br> - Commandant Esterhazy.<br> Before we hear his testimony,<br> the courtroom will be cleared.<br> Commandant Esterhazy.<br> - I'm not going in there.<br> - Shut up, you fool.<br> This has gone too far<br> for you to let us down.<br> It's not a question of Dreyfus now,<br> it's all of us. So watch yourself.<br> Don't do anything foolish,<br> even if they provoke you.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You haven't got a gun, have you?<br> Do you swear to speak the truth<br> without hatred or fear...<br> ...the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth?<br> I swear.<br> Ask your first question.<br> Did he write the secret document...<br> ...containing coded military information<br> known as the bordereau?<br> - I shall not answer.<br> - How did he enter the French army?<br> I will not answer him.<br> Didn't he first offer his services<br> to the Turkish army?<br> Didn't Commandant Esterhazy<br> write this letter?<br> "I would be happy to die<br> sabering Frenchmen...<br> ...as a captain of German uhlans."<br> Didn't he try to have a perfectly sane<br> secret service agent certified as insane...<br> ...because he described the commandant<br> as visiting a foreign military attach?<br> Did Commandant Esterhazy<br> not have dealings...<br> ...with the military attach? Colonel von Schwartzkoppen?<br> I will not permit that question.<br> It involves our foreign policy.<br> I'll put it differently.<br> Didn't he admit to newspaper reporters<br> negotiating with von Schwartzkoppen?<br> The question will not be put. France's<br> honor and security mustn't be touched.<br> I see.<br> The honor and security of France...<br> ...permit an officer to do things<br> but not discuss them.<br> Did he tell an English journalist<br> that if Zola was acquitted...<br> ...the streets of Paris would be strewn<br> with 100,000 corpses?<br> Mr. President.<br> - Colonel Henry, you wish to take the stand?<br> - Lf you please.<br> We've tried to honor the court<br> and exclude the Dreyfus affair...<br> ...but the defense makes it impossible.<br> They claim they want light.<br> Very well.<br> Now they're going to have it.<br> We've long had final, positive proof<br> that Dreyfus was guilty of treason.<br> A secret document unknown at the time<br> of the Dreyfus trial fell into our hands.<br> It was written by one foreign military<br> attach?to another, containing the words:<br> "Don't tell anyone of your connection<br> with this office or deed."<br> Every time a general officer takes<br> his hat off, a secret document pops up.<br> Dreyfus was sacrificed to one.<br> My client is threatened with another.<br> Give this to Monsieur Labori.<br> Will Colonel Henry<br> produce that document?<br> It will endanger relations with foreign<br> powers if secret documents were revealed.<br> - Where is it?<br> - My word should be sufficient.<br> Words are no longer good enough.<br> Where is that document?<br> You have already been told<br> it cannot be brought here.<br> Call your next witness.<br> I will not proceed<br> until that document is produced.<br> - Call your next witness.<br> - No, no and no, Mr. President!<br> Not until this court rules<br> or that document is produced.<br> It is not in my power to produce it.<br> Perhaps the chief of staff.<br> May I add further information<br> on this subject?<br> Certainly, general.<br> Please take the stand.<br> I confirm in every point the deposition<br> of Colonel Henry about that document.<br> It absolutely proved Dreyfus' guilt...<br> ...and it is too dangerous<br> to reveal in public.<br> You of the jury, you represent the nation.<br> If that nation hasn't confidence in us...<br> ...the heads of the army,<br> at this critical time, then I shall resign.<br> - I have no more to say.<br> - But I have.<br> I wish to recall Colonel Picquart<br> to the stand.<br> - No, don't go. Stay here, please.<br> - Colonel Picquart, please take the stand.<br> Will Colonel Picquart tell us what he knows<br> about this mysterious secret document?<br> The document came to my attention while<br> I was chief of the intelligence service.<br> Inasmuch as it was secret,<br> it was my duty to say nothing about it.<br> As it has been openly mentioned here<br> by my superior officer...<br> ...that restriction no longer applies,<br> and I shall speak.<br> The chief of staff was right<br> upon one point.<br> That secret document is too dangerous<br> to bring here, but not in the way he means.<br> It is too dangerous to the prosecution.<br> They dare not produce it<br> because that document is a forgery...<br> ...committed by an intelligence officer<br> in this room...<br> ...to seal Dreyfus' fate<br> and save the face of the general staff.<br> This is irrelevant to the present trial.<br> - I protest this court's partiality.<br> - For the last time, I warn you!<br> These generals, substituting<br> for arguments their uniform...<br> ...come to the stand,<br> even address the jury...<br> ...violating or invoking professional<br> secrecy as they find convenient...<br> ...saying what they please.<br> But when I wish to question these<br> exalted beings and expose the truth...<br> ...the court bars my questions<br> before it knows what they are.<br> I shall not tolerate<br> this insult to justice.<br> And I will not tolerate<br> the partiality of this court!<br> Officers are allowed to say<br> what they please.<br> Newspapers hostile to Zola are permitted<br> to threaten and intimidate the jury.<br> Crosses mark their doors for the vengeance<br> of the mob if Zola is acquitted, but if l...<br> You cannot go on!<br> I'll say what I have to say<br> if this trial lasts six months!<br> Court is adjourned.<br> Bravo, Zola!<br> As prefect of police,<br> I insist you leave by the side door.<br> Otherwise, I cannot guarantee<br> your safety.<br> I think he's right.<br> Thank you very much,<br> but I shall leave like anyone else.<br> Has the jury gone out yet?<br> No, the advocate general<br> is still speaking.<br> And Zola sought only publicity.<br> That, gentlemen, is the true picture<br> of their fight for humanity, right and truth.<br> It rests with you, gentlemen, to answer<br> this insulting challenge to our army.<br> Zola must be punished,<br> and all France awaits your verdict.<br> Down with Zola!<br> Quiet. Quiet! Quiet!<br> Mr. President, Monsieur Zola requests<br> that he be allowed to speak.<br> Permission granted.<br> Gentlemen...<br> ...in the House of Deputies<br> a month ago...<br> ...to frantic applause,<br> the prime minister, Monsieur Maline...<br> ...declared that he had confidence<br> in you 12 citizens...<br> ...into whose hands he had bestowed<br> the defense of the army.<br> In other words...<br> ...you are being instructed,<br> by order, to condemn me...<br> ...just as, in that other case...<br> ...the minister of war<br> dictated the acquittal of Esterhazy.<br> Down with Zola!<br> The prime minister gave<br> no such order to this jury.<br> His words made his intention<br> to coerce justice unmistakable.<br> And I denounce them<br> to the conscience of honest men.<br> Confine yourself to the facts.<br> However...<br> ...my profession is writing,<br> not talking.<br> But from my struggling youth<br> until today...<br> ...my principal aim<br> has been to strive for truth.<br> That is why I entered this fight.<br> All my friends have told me that it<br> was insane for a single person...<br> ...to oppose the immense machinery<br> of the law...<br> ...the glory of the army<br> and the power of the state.<br> They warned me that my actions<br> would be mercilessly crushed...<br> ...that I would be destroyed.<br> But what does it matter<br> if an individual is shattered...<br> ...if only justice is resurrected?<br> It has been said that the state<br> summoned me to this court.<br> That is not true.<br> I am here because I wished it.<br> I alone have chosen you as my judges.<br> I alone decided that this abominable<br> affair should see the light...<br> ...so that France might at last know all<br> and voice her opinion.<br> My act has no other object.<br> My person is of no account.<br> I'm satisfied.<br> But my confidence in you<br> was not shared by the state.<br> They did not dare say all<br> about the whole undividable affair...<br> ...and submit it to your verdict.<br> That is no fault of mine.<br> You saw for yourselves how my defense<br> was incessantly silenced.<br> Gentlemen, I know you.<br> You are the heart,<br> the intellect of my beloved Paris...<br> ...where I was born<br> and which I've studied for 40 years.<br> I see you with your families<br> under the evening lamp.<br> I accompany you into your factories,<br> your shops.<br> You're all workers and righteous men.<br> You will not say, like many:<br> "What does it matter if an innocent man<br> is undergoing torture on Devil's Island?<br> Is the suffering of one obscure person<br> worth the disturbance of a great country?"<br> Perhaps, though, you've been told<br> that by punishing me...<br> ...you will stop a campaign<br> that is injurious to France.<br> Gentlemen, if that is your idea...<br> ...you are mistaken.<br> Look at me.<br> Have I the look of a hireling?<br> A liar? A traitor?<br> I'm only a free writer<br> who has given his life to work...<br> ...and who will resume it tomorrow.<br> And I am not here defending myself.<br> Tremendous pressure<br> has been put upon you.<br> "Save the army.<br> Convict Zola and save France."<br> I say to you, pick up that challenge!<br> Save the army and save France...<br> ...but do it by letting truth conquer.<br> Not only is an innocent man<br> crying out for justice...<br> ...but more. Much more.<br> A great nation is in desperate danger<br> of forfeiting her honor.<br> Do not take upon yourselves a fault...<br> ...the burden of which<br> you will forever bear in history.<br> A judicial blunder has been committed!<br> The condemnation of an innocent man<br> induced the acquittal of a guilty man.<br> And now, today,<br> you're asked to condemn me...<br> ...because I rebelled on seeing our country<br> embarked on this terrible course.<br> At this solemn moment,<br> in the presence of this tribunal...<br> ...which is the representative<br> of human justice...<br> ...before you gentlemen of the jury...<br> ...before France,<br> before the whole world...<br> ...I swear that Dreyfus is innocent.<br> By my 40 years of work,<br> by all that I have won...<br> ...by all that I have written<br> to spread the spirit of France...<br> ...I swear that Dreyfus is innocent.<br> May all that melt away.<br> May my name perish<br> if Dreyfus be not innocent.<br> He is innocent.<br> Down with Zola!<br> This is no punishment,<br> just a precaution.<br> Gentlemen, the court!<br> Emile Zola...<br> ...the jury has found you guilty.<br> You are hereby sentenced<br> to one year's imprisonment...<br> ...and 3000 francs' fine.<br> Cannibals.<br> Once before,<br> the centuries reversed a judgment.<br> That too was a closed case.<br> - Emile, you must leave France immediately.<br> - Leave France?<br> Yes. Go into hiding. England,<br> any place where they can't get at you.<br> Run away like a common criminal?<br> Do you know what you're saying?<br> You're out of your mind.<br> My husband couldn't do such a thing.<br> It's entirely unworthy of his character.<br> - What will people say?<br> - What would you expect them to say?<br> "Zola condemned, Zola in cowardly flight."<br> I'd be denounced by my friends<br> as well as my enemies.<br> It's true.<br> In prison, you'd be a martyr...<br> ...an object of sympathy<br> for the entire world.<br> But helpless to do anything.<br> In London, you are all-powerful.<br> You can still fight for Dreyfus,<br> write smashing articles, pamphlets...<br> ...keep on pricking at<br> the conscience of the world.<br> Emile, there are times when it is<br> more courageous to be cowardly.<br> Alexandrine...<br> ...pack me a few warm things.<br> It must be cold in London.<br> Zola in England.<br> London police on the lookout.<br> Zola in England.<br> Here you are, governor. Thank you.<br> Zola in England.<br> London police on lookout.<br> Zola in England.<br> - Are you alone?<br> - Yes, go in.<br> - Well, what is it?<br> - Well, it's come.<br> - What?<br> - The new war minister has summoned me.<br> - You've been what?<br> - I'm on my way there now.<br> - Admit nothing.<br> - "Admit nothing."<br> With that cursed Zola still writing,<br> still stirring up trouble...<br> ...the whole world screaming<br> for the truth...<br> ...duels, newspapers...<br> ...everyone at each other's throats.<br> You can't hold it off much longer.<br> You can't, I tell you.<br> You got me into this.<br> You've gotta stick by me.<br> Understand?<br> Do as I tell you. Admit nothing.<br> Then come back<br> and tell me what they say.<br> I'll be waiting for you.<br> I want the truth.<br> The whole truth, Colonel Henry.<br> Speak up!<br> But, Your Excellency,<br> the honor of the army...<br> I'll hear no more from you<br> about honor.<br> - You're a common forger.<br> - Your Excellency, I swear I'm not.<br> Show him the document that played such<br> an important part during the Zola trial.<br> Take it up. Take it up. Look at it.<br> Read it!<br> "Don't tell anyone...<br> ...of your connection with the..."<br> I didn't write it!<br> I had nothing to do with it, I swear!<br> You're lying.<br> The secret agent who was your accomplice<br> confessed everything before killing himself.<br> I give you one last chance<br> to tell the truth.<br> Did you forge this letter?<br> Yes.<br> I did it for the army.<br> I did it for the honor of the army.<br> You're under arrest.<br> Captain Guignet,<br> have him taken to the prison.<br> - I want a signed confession.<br> - Not now, sir. I beg you.<br> Later, I'll tell everything.<br> I can't stand anything more now.<br> I want a signed confession.<br> Take him away.<br> Our army no longer has room<br> for men of your kind. Understand?<br> Yes, Your Excellency.<br> You'll be confined to barracks<br> until you leave. That's all.<br> I think you're making a grave mistake,<br> Your Excellency.<br> The army always has to consider the...<br> You'll have my resignation<br> in the morning.<br> Good morning, captain.<br> - How's Colonel Henry?<br> - He did nothing but scream all night.<br> Something about the honor of the army.<br> But he seems to be quiet now.<br> Suicide.<br> Good morning, Mr. Zola.<br> Oh, it's you. Good morning.<br> Where's your papa? Will he come back<br> from the village with my newspapers?<br> - He'll be along presently.<br> - Presently?! Presently!<br> The whole world is seething,<br> nations are crashing to their doom...<br> ...and he'll be along presently.<br> Oh, you cold-blooded English.<br> You'll be the death of me.<br> Emile! It's happened.<br> It's happened! Look.<br> Listen. The Times:<br> "Colonel Henry confesses<br> Dreyfus forgery, then kills himself."<br> The Daily Telegraph:<br> "Chief of general staff resigns.<br> Colonel Dort expelled from army.<br> Esterhazy in flight."<br> The Manchester Guardian:<br> "Zola's fight for truth<br> vindicated at last."<br> And Dreyfus?<br> "Dreyfus case revision inevitable."<br> Truth is on the march...<br> ...and nothing will stop it.<br> "The criminal code of cessation has entered<br> a request for revision of your court-martial.<br> You hereby cease to be subject<br> to penal regime."<br> The Cruelesfax will carry you back<br> to France. Sentries, dismissed.<br> - Whatever induced Esterhazy to confess?<br> - The money the newspaper paid him.<br> After that, no one could deny you<br> the right to come home.<br> What a triumph. Don't you feel...?<br> I feel neither the desire<br> nor the need for triumph.<br> My reward?<br> I have it. Every time I think we saved<br> an innocent man from a living death.<br> The thought of seeing him free...<br> ...of pressing his hands in mine<br> for the first time...<br> ...that will be reward enough.<br> But our fight is only half won.<br> We must work, my friends, work.<br> By speech, by pen, by action.<br> We of France, who gave the world<br> the boon of liberty...<br> ...shall we not now give it justice?<br> Listen. The very wheels are crying:<br> "Justice, justice, justice, justice."<br> Please, Emile. It's past midnight, dear.<br> You've done enough.<br> What's become of my military dictionary?<br> You know, the big green one.<br> Why, Emile...<br> ...isn't this it?<br> Why, so it is.<br> Must you drive yourself like this<br> day and night?<br> I must. I must, Alexandrine. I must.<br> There's so much to do<br> and so little time to do it.<br> I see it all clearly now:<br> The cause and the effect.<br> The roots and the tree.<br> - But, darling...<br> - Wait. Wait a minute.<br> The cause and the effect.<br> The roots and the tree.<br> I can use that.<br> What were you saying, my dear?<br> I said, I can't understand<br> all this frantic hurry.<br> - There's always tomorrow.<br> - Always? I wonder.<br> I wonder if in the middle<br> of my most important work...<br> ...there will always be a tomorrow.<br> Darling, you're tired.<br> What matters the individual<br> if the idea survives?<br> Now, you must get some rest.<br> You have to be up early<br> for the Dreyfus ceremony.<br> Yes, Dreyfus. Yes, tomorrow<br> he will be restored to the army.<br> You know, it's a queer thing,<br> this Dreyfus affair.<br> Before it, I thought my work was done.<br> I could sit back and dream a little.<br> Cezanne was right.<br> I was getting smug and complacent.<br> Then suddenly came the Dreyfus explosion,<br> and I'm alive again...<br> ...my head bursting with ideas!<br> This new book is bigger than anything<br> I've ever dared before.<br> The world about to hurl itself<br> to destruction...<br> ...the will of nations for peace,<br> a powerful break, stopping it on the brink.<br> You don't believe it? Wait.<br> "To save Dreyfus, we had to challenge<br> the might of those who dominate the world.<br> It is not the swaggering militarists.<br> They're but puppets that dance<br> as the strings are pulled.<br> It is those others,<br> those who would ruthlessly plunge us...<br> ...into the bloody abyss of war<br> to protect their power."<br> Think of it, thousands of children<br> sleeping peacefully tonight...<br> ...under the roofs of Paris, Berlin,<br> London, all the world...<br> ...doomed to die horribly<br> under some titanic battlefield...<br> ...unless it can be prevented.<br> And it can be prevented!<br> The world must be conquered...<br> ...but not by force of arms,<br> but by ideas that liberate.<br> Then can we build it anew.<br> Build for the humble and the wretched.<br> That's good.<br> I must remember that.<br> - Good night, my darling.<br> - Good night, dear.<br> There...<br> - but by ideas that liberate.<br> Then can we build.<br> Build for the humble...<br> ...and the wretched.<br> "The court of revision,<br> having unanimously agreed...<br> ...that Alfred Dreyfus was and is<br> innocent of the charges against him...<br> ...have, in acquitting him, reversed<br> the verdict of the former court.<br> The French government has ordered<br> a proclamation of his innocence...<br> ...to be posted in every French town,<br> in every village, in every colony.<br> And he is hereby reinstated,<br> promoted to the rank of commandant...<br> ...and confirmed in all honors previously<br> held by him in the army of France."<br> Commandant Dreyfus,<br> in behalf of the president...<br> ...the people of the republic,<br> and by virtue of the powers vested in me...<br> ...I knight you a member<br> of the Legion of Honor.<br> Close the ceremony.<br> - Long live Dreyfus!<br> - Long live Dreyfus!<br> Long live Dreyfus!<br> - Congratulations, commandant.<br> - General Picquart, thank you.<br> - This is a proud day for France.<br> - My deepest congratulations.<br> Didn't Zola come?<br> Zola found dead!<br> Zola found dead!<br> Zola found dead!<br> "Zola dead.<br> Carbon monoxide gas<br> kills famous writer."<br> Let us not mourn him.<br> Let us rather salute that bright spirit of his,<br> which will live forever.<br> And, like a torch, enlighten a younger<br> generation inspired to follow him.<br> You who are enjoying<br> today's freedom...<br> ...take to your hearts<br> the words of Zola.<br> Do not forget those who fought<br> the battles for you...<br> ...and bought your liberty<br> with their genius and their blood.<br> Do not forget them and applaud<br> the lies of fanatical intolerance.<br> Be human.<br> For no man<br> in all the breadth of our land...<br> ...more fervently loved humanity<br> than Zola.<br> He had the simplicity of a great soul.<br> He was enjoying the fruits<br> of his labor...<br> ...fame, wealth, security...<br> ...when suddenly,<br> out of his own free will...<br> ...he tore himself from<br> all the peaceful pleasures of his life...<br> ...from the work he loved so much...<br> ...because he knew that there is<br> no serenity save in justice...<br> ...no repose save in truth.<br> At the sound of his brave words,<br> France awakened from her sleep.<br> How admirable is the genius<br> of our country.<br> How beautiful the soul of France...<br> ...which for centuries taught right<br> and justice to Europe and the world.<br> France is once again today<br> the land of reason and benevolence...<br> ...because one of her sons, through<br> an immense work and a great action...<br> ...gave rise to a new order of things<br> based on justice...<br> ...and the rights common to all men.<br> Let us not pity him<br> because he suffered and endured.<br> Let us envy him.<br> Let us envy him because his great heart<br> won him the proudest of destinies.<br> He was a moment<br> of the conscience of man.<br>
