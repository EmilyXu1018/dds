So does Eleanor.<br> She knows young Henry's dead.<br> The young king died in summer, and I haven't<br> named an heir. She knows I want John...<br> on the throne, and I know she wants<br> Richard... we are very frank about it.<br> Henry, I can't be your mistress<br> if I'm married to your son.<br> Why can't you?<br> Johnny wouldn't mind.<br> I do not like your Johnny.<br> He's a good boy.<br> He's got pimples,<br> and he smells of compost.<br> He's just 16!<br> He can't help the pimples.<br> He could have a bath!<br> It isn't such a dreadful thing<br> to be queen of England.<br> Not all eyes will weep for you.<br> Will yours?<br> I don't know.<br> Very likely.<br> All I want is not to lose you.<br> Can't you hide me?<br> Can't I simply disappear?<br> You know you can't.<br> Your little brother Philip's king of France now,<br> and he wants your wedding or your dowry back.<br> I only took you for your<br> dowry. You were seven...<br> two big knees and two big eyes,<br> and that's all.<br> How was I to know?<br> Hey. What's the matter, lad? Nothing.<br> - Geoff!<br> - Johnny!<br> Is that for me?<br> I love Christmas.<br> What difference does<br> my dowry make?<br> Let Philip have it back.<br> It isn't much. I can't.<br> The vexin is a little county,<br> but it's vital to me. And I'm not.<br> It's been my luck to fall<br> in love with landed women.<br> When I married Eleanor<br> I thought, "you lucky man.<br> "The richest woman in the<br> world... she owns the Aquitaine,<br> the greatest province in the<br> continent, and beautiful as well. "<br> She was, you know.<br> And you adored her.<br> Memory fails. There may<br> have been an era when I did.<br> Let's have one strand askew. Nothing<br> in life has any business being perfect.<br> If I say you and I are done,<br> we're done.<br> If I say marry John,<br> it's John.<br> I'll have you by me,<br> and I'll use you as I like.<br> Ah, Christmas...<br> warm and rosy time.<br> The hot wine steams,<br> the yule log roars,<br> and we're the fat<br> that's in the fire.<br> She'll be here soon,<br> you know. Who? Mother.<br> She still want you to be king? We<br> are not as friendly as we used to be.<br> If I'm supposed to make a fuss<br> and kiss her hairy cheek, I won't.<br> What you kiss,<br> little prince, is up to you.<br> I'm father's favorite.<br> That's what counts.<br> You hardly know me, Johnny, so I<br> beg you to believe my reputation.<br> I am a constant soldier, a<br> sometime poet, and I will be king.<br> Just you remember...<br> father loves me best.<br> Why John? John doesn't<br> care for you at all.<br> We love each other deeply. None<br> of them has any love for you.<br> Because we fight?<br> Tell me all three want the crown. I'll<br> tell you it's a feeble prince that doesn't.<br> They may snap at me and plot, and that<br> makes them the kind of sons I want.<br> I've snapped and plotted<br> all my life.<br> There's no other way to be a<br> king, alive and 50 all at once.<br> I'm going to fight for you.<br> Oh, fine.<br> How was your crossing?<br> Did the channel part for you?<br> It went flat when I told it to.<br> I didn't think to ask for more.<br> How dear of you to let me out of<br> jail. It's only for the holidays.<br> Like school, you keep me young.<br> Here's gentle Alais.<br> No,<br> greet me as you used to.<br> Fragile I am not.<br> Affection is a pressure<br> I can bear.<br> Oh, but I do have<br> handsome children.<br> John, you're so clean and neat.<br> Henry takes good care of you.<br> And Richard.<br> Don't look sullen, dear. It makes<br> your eyes go small and piggy...<br> and your chin look weak.<br> Geoffrey.<br> Is Philip here yet?<br> Not yet.<br> Let's hope he's<br> grown up like his father...<br> Simon pure and Simon simple...<br> good, good, Louis.<br> If I had managed sons for him<br> instead of all those little girls,<br> I'd still be stuck<br> with being queen of France,<br> and we should not have<br> known each other.<br> Such, my angels,<br> is the role of sex in history.<br> Thatwill be Philip.<br> Where's Henry?<br> Upstairs with the family whore.<br> That's a mean and tawdry way<br> to talk about your fiancee.<br> My fiancee.<br> Whosever fiancee.<br> I brought her up, and she<br> is dear to me and gentle.<br> He still plans to make John<br> king. Of course he does.<br> My, what a greedy little trinity<br> you are... king, king, king.<br> Two of you must learn to live with<br> disappointment. Ah, but which two?<br> Let's deny them all<br> and live forever.<br> Tusk to tusk<br> through all eternity.<br> Ah, my boys.<br> The king of France and I will<br> shortly have a tactile conversation,<br> like two surgeons<br> looking for a lump.<br> We'll state positions, and I'll make the first<br> of many offers. He'll refuse it, naturally.<br> I'll make a better one, and so on<br> through the holidays until I win.<br> For the duration of this joyous ritual<br> you will give to your father your support.<br> - My lord!<br> - Your grace!<br> Welcome to chinon.<br> Ah, that's better.<br> I was told you were impressive<br> for a boy of 17.<br> - I'm Eleanor, who might have been your mother.<br> - queen Eleanor.<br> All the others here you know.<br> I gather you're disturbed<br> about your sister and her dowry.<br> Sixteen years ago<br> you made a treaty with us.<br> - It is time its terms were executed.<br> - I should think so.<br> Our position comes to this:<br> That you will either hold the<br> marriage or return the vexin.<br> Alais marries Richard, or we'll<br> have the county back at once.<br> That's clear, concise<br> and well presented.<br> My position...<br> well, frankly, Philip,<br> it's a tangle.<br> Two years ago, the queen and I...<br> for reasons passing understanding...<br> gave the Aquitaine to Richard.<br> That makes Richard<br> very powerful.<br> How can I give him Alais too?<br> The man she marries<br> has you for an ally.<br> It's their wedding or the vexin back.<br> Those are the terms you made with Louis.<br> True, but academic, lad.<br> The vexin's mine.<br> By what authority? It's got my troops<br> all over it. That makes it mine.<br> Now, hear me, boy.<br> I am a king. I am no man's boy. A king?<br> Because you put your ass<br> on purple cushions?<br> - Sir.<br> - Philip.<br> You haven't got<br> the feel of this at all, lad.<br> Use all your voices.<br> When I bellow, bellow back.<br> I'll mark that down.<br> This too:<br> We are the world in small.<br> A nation is a human thing. It<br> does what we do, for our reasons.<br> Surely if we're civilized,<br> we can put away the knives.<br> We can make peace.<br> We have it in our hands.<br> I've tutors of my own.<br> Will that be all? Oh, think.<br> You came here for a reason. Don't you<br> want to ask me if I've got an offer?<br> Have you got an offer? Not<br> yet, but I'll think of one.<br> Oh, by the way,<br> you're better at this<br> than I thought you'd be.<br> I wasn't sure you'd noticed.<br> Well, what shall we hang...<br> the holly or each other?<br> Would you say, father, that I have<br> the makings of a king? A splendid king.<br> And would you expect me, father,<br> to give up without a fight?<br> Of course you'll fight.<br> I raised you to.<br> I don't care what you offer Philip,<br> I don't care what plans you make.<br> I'll have the Aquitaine<br> and Alais and the crown.<br> I'll not give up one<br> to get the other.<br> I won't trade off Alais or the<br> Aquitaine to that walking pustule!<br> No, your loving son will not.<br> Did you hear what he<br> called me? Clearly, dear.<br> Now, run along. It's nearly dinnertime.<br> I only do what father tells me.<br> Go and eat.<br> Did I say something wrong?<br> I'm always saying something<br> wrong. And don't pout.<br> I'm not pouting. And stand up straight!<br> How often do I have to tell you?<br> And that's to be the king.<br> And I'm to be his chancellor.<br> Has he told you?<br> John will rule the country<br> while I run it, that is to say,<br> he gets to spend<br> the taxes that I raise.<br> How nice for you. It's<br> not as nice as being king.<br> We've made you duke of<br> brittany. Is that so little?<br> No one ever thinks of crown<br> and mentions Geoff. Why is that?<br> Isn't being chancellor<br> power enough?<br> It's not the power I feel deprived<br> of. It's the mention I miss.<br> There's no affection<br> for me here.<br> You wouldn't think<br> I'd want that, would you?<br> Henry?<br> Hmm?<br> I have a confession.<br> Yeah?<br> - I don't much like<br> our children.<br> Only you... the child I raised but<br> didn't bear. You never cared for me.<br> I did and do, believe me.<br> Henry's bed is Henry's province.<br> He can people it with sheep<br> for all I care,<br> which, on occasion,<br> he has done.<br> Rosamund's been dead<br> for seven years.<br> Two months and 18 days.<br> I never liked her much.<br> - You count the days?<br> - I made the numbers up.<br> He found miss clifford<br> in the mists of wales...<br> and brought her home<br> for closer observation.<br> Liking what he found,<br> he scrutinized her many years.<br> He loved her deeply, and<br> she, him. And yet, my dear,<br> when Henry had to choose<br> between his lady and my lands...<br> there is no sport in<br> hurting me. It's so easy.<br> After all the years<br> of loving care,<br> do you think I could<br> bring myself to hurt you?<br> Eleanor, with both hands<br> tied behind you.<br> She is lovely, isn't she?<br> Yes, very.<br> Who could I have chosen<br> to love...<br> to gall you more?<br> There's no one.<br> Time hasn't done a thing<br> but wrinkle you.<br> It hasn't even done that. I've<br> borne six girls, five boys...<br> and 31 connubial years of you.<br> How am I possible? There<br> are moments when I miss you.<br> Many? That's my wooly<br> sheepdog. Do you doubt it?<br> So, wee Johnny gets the crown.<br> I've heard it rumored,<br> but I don't believe it.<br> Losing Alais will be hard,<br> for you do love her.<br> It's an old man's last<br> attachment, nothing more.<br> How hard do you find<br> living in your castle?<br> It was difficult in the<br> beginning, but that's past.<br> I find I've seen<br> the world enough.<br> I'll never let you loose.<br> You led too many<br> civil wars against me.<br> And I damn near won the last one.<br> Still, as long as I get trotted out...<br> for Christmas courts and<br> state occasions now and then...<br> for I do like to see you...<br> it's enough.<br> I'm famished.<br> Let's go in to dinner.<br> Arm in arm.<br> And hand in hand.<br> You're still<br> a marvel of a man.<br> And you're my lady.<br> It's an odd thing, Eleanor.<br> I've fought and bargained<br> all these years...<br> as if the only thing I had to live<br> for was what happened after I was dead.<br> I've something else<br> to live for now.<br> I've blundered onto peace.<br> On Christmas eve.<br> Since Louis died, while Philip<br> grew, I've had no France to fight.<br> In that lull, I've found how<br> good it is to write a law...<br> or make a tax more fair<br> or sit in judgment to decide...<br> which peasant gets a cow.<br> I tell you, there is nothing<br> more important in the world.<br> Now the french boy's big enough,<br> and I'm sick of war.<br> Do you still need<br> the vexin, Henry?<br> It's as vital as it ever was. My troops<br> there are one day away from paris.<br> That's a march of 20 miles.<br> I must keep it.<br> Henry, dear,<br> if Alais does not marry Richard,<br> I will see you lose the vexin.<br> Well, I thought<br> you'd never say it.<br> I can do it.<br> You can try.<br> We have a pack of barons we<br> should look the loving couple for.<br> Can you read love in that?<br> And permanent affection.<br> My Richard is the next king,<br> not your John.<br> I know you, Henry. I know<br> every twist and bend you've got,<br> and I'll be waiting<br> round each corner for you.<br> Do you truly care<br> who's king?<br> I care because<br> you care so much.<br> Don't fight me, Eleanor. What would you<br> have me do... give out, give up, give in?<br> Give me a little peace.<br> A little?<br> Why so modest? How about eternal<br> peace? Now, there's a thought.<br> If you oppose me,<br> I'll strike you any way I can.<br> Henry?<br> Madam?<br> Did you ever love me?<br> No.<br> Good. That will<br> make this pleasanter.<br> Well, I've come.<br> I'm here.<br> What was it you wanted?<br> Just to talk.<br> We haven't been alone,<br> the two of us, in...<br> how long is it, lamb...<br> two years?<br> You look fit.<br> War agrees with you.<br> I keep informed. I follow all<br> your slaughters from a distance.<br> Do sit down.<br> Is this an audience, a good-night<br> hug with kisses or an ambush?<br> Let's hope it's a reunion.<br> Must you look so stern?<br> I sent for you to say<br> I want your love again,<br> but I can't say it<br> to a face like that.<br> My love, of all things.<br> What would you want it for?<br> Why, for itself. What<br> other purpose could I have?<br> You will tell me<br> when you're ready to.<br> I scheme a lot, I know.<br> I plot and plan.<br> That's how a queen<br> in prison spends her time.<br> But there is more to me<br> than that.<br> Can't I say I love a son<br> and be believed?<br> If I were you,<br> I'd try another tack.<br> I've no dammed up floods of passion for<br> you. There's no chance I'll overflow.<br> You're a dull boy, dull as plainsong.<br> La-la-la, forever on one note.<br> I gave the church up out of<br> boredom. I can do as much for you.<br> You'll never give me up,<br> not while I hold the Aquitaine.<br> You think I'm motivated by love of hills<br> and dales? I think you want it back.<br> You're so deceitful, you can't<br> ask for water when you're thirsty.<br> We could tangle spiders<br> in the webs you weave.<br> If I'm so devious,<br> why don't you go?<br> Don't stand there<br> qulvering in limbo.<br> Love me, little lamb,<br> or leave me.<br> Leave you, madam?<br> With pure joy.<br> Departure's a simple act. You put the<br> left foot down, and then the right.<br> Mother! Hush, dear. Mother's fighting.<br> Father's finished working out<br> the treaty terms.<br> How nice.<br> Where is your father?<br> Ah, there you are.<br> Well, have you<br> put the terms to Philip?<br> Not yet, but we're shortly granting him<br> an audience. I hope you'll all attend.<br> Are we to know the terms,<br> or would you rather tease us?<br> Not at all. The terms are... what are<br> you giving to Philip, what of mine?<br> Whatever you've got goes to me. And<br> what's the nothing Geoffrey gets?<br> My God, boys,<br> you can't all three be king.<br> All three of us can try.<br> That's pointless now.<br> I want you to succeed me,<br> Richard.<br> Alais and the crown...<br> I give you both.<br> I've no sense of humor.<br> If I did, I'd laugh.<br> - I mean to do it.<br> - What about me?<br> I'm your favorite.<br> I'm the one you love.<br> I'm sorry, John.<br> I can't help myself.<br> Could you keep anything I gave you?<br> Could you beat him in the field?<br> You could.<br> John, I won't be there.<br> I'm losing too.<br> All my dreams for you are lost.<br> You've led me on.<br> I never meant to.<br> You're a failure as a father.<br> You know that? I'm sorry, Johnny.<br> Not yet, but I'll do something<br> terrible, and you'll be sorry then.<br> Did you rehearse all this,<br> or are you improvising?<br> Good God, woman,<br> face the facts.<br> Which ones?<br> We have so many.<br> Power is the only fact.<br> How could I keep him<br> from the throne?<br> He'd only take it<br> if I didn't give it to him.<br> No, you'd make me<br> fight for it.<br> I know you. You'd never give me<br> anything. True, and I haven't.<br> You get Alais and the kingdom,<br> but I get the thing I want most:<br> If you're king, England<br> stays intact. I get that.<br> It's all yours now... the crown,<br> the girl, the whole black business.<br> Isn't that enough?<br> I don't know<br> who's to be congratulated.<br> Kings, Queens, knights everywhere<br> you look, and I'm the only pawn.<br> I haven't got a thing to lose.<br> That makes me dangerous.<br> - Poor child.<br> - Poor John.<br> Who says, "poor John"?<br> Don't everybody sob at once.<br> My God, if I went up in flames,<br> there's not a living soul...<br> who'd pee on me<br> to put the fire out.<br> Let's strike a flint and see.<br> You're everything a little<br> brother dreams of, you know that?<br> - I used to dream about you all the time.<br> - Ah, Johnny.<br> I'll show you, Eleanor.<br> I've not lost yet.<br> Well, mummy,<br> if you want me, here I am.<br> John's lost his chancellor,<br> has he? And you've gained one.<br> It's a bitter thing<br> your mummy has to say.<br> She doesn't trust me. You must<br> know Henry isn't through with John.<br> He'll keep the vexin till<br> the moon goes blue from cold.<br> And as for Richard's wedding day...<br> we'll see the second coming first.<br> The needlework alone can<br> last for years.<br> I know.<br> You know I know.<br> I know you know I know.<br> We know Henry knows,<br> and Henry knows we know it.<br> We're a knowledgeable family.<br> Will Richard take me<br> for his chancellor or won't he?<br> Why are you dropping John?<br> Because you're going to win. You will,<br> with me to help you. I haven't yet.<br> I can handle John. He'll<br> swallow anything I tell him.<br> I'll take him by the hand and<br> walk him into the trap you set.<br> You're good.<br> You're first class, Geoff.<br> You'd sell John out to me,<br> or me to John, or...<br> you can tell me... have you found some<br> way of selling everyone to everybody?<br> Not yet, mummy,<br> but I'm working on it.<br> I don't care who's king,<br> but you and Henry do.<br> I want to watch the two of you<br> go picnicking on one another.<br> You have a gift for hating.<br> You're the expert.<br> You should know.<br> Dear lord.<br> You've loved me<br> all these years.<br> Oh, God forgive me. I've upset<br> the queen. We need you. Help us.<br> What... and miss the fun<br> of selling you?<br> Be Richard's chancellor.<br> Rot.<br> Well, that's how<br> deals are made.<br> We've got him<br> if we want him.<br> He'll sell us all,<br> you know,<br> but only if he thinks<br> we think he won't.<br> Why did I have to have<br> such clever children?<br> What's the matter, Richard? Nothing.<br> It's a heavy thing,<br> your nothing.<br> When I write or send for you<br> or speak or reach,<br> your nothings come,<br> like stones.<br> Don't play a scene with me.<br> I wouldn't if I could.<br> I'm simpler than I used to be.<br> I had, at one time,<br> many appetites.<br> I wanted poetry and power and the<br> young men who create them both.<br> I even wanted Henry, too,<br> in those days.<br> Now I've only one desire left...<br> to see you king.<br> The only thing you want to see is<br> father's vitals on a bed of lettuce.<br> You don't care who wins, as long<br> as Henry loses. You'd do anything.<br> You are Medea to the teeth,<br> only this is one son you won't use<br> for vengeance against your husband.<br> How my captivity has<br> changed you.<br> Henry meant to hurt me.<br> He's hacked you up instead.<br> Men coveted this talon once.<br> Henry was 18 when we met,<br> and I was queen of France.<br> He came down from the north to<br> Paris with a mind like Aristotle's...<br> and a form like mortal sin.<br> We shattered the commandments<br> on the spot.<br> I spent three months annulling<br> Louis, then in may, in spring,<br> not far from here,<br> we married...<br> young count Henry<br> and his countess.<br> But in three years' time I was his<br> queen, and he was king of England.<br> Done at 21... five years<br> your junior, general.<br> I can count. There was no Thomas<br> Beckett then, or Rosamund...<br> no rivals, only me.<br> And then young Henry came,<br> and you...<br> and all the other blossoms<br> in my garden.<br> Yes. Had I been sterile,<br> darling, I'd be happier today.<br> Is that designed to hurt me?<br> What a waste.<br> I've fought with Henry over who<br> comes next, whose dawn it is...<br> and which son gets the sunset,<br> and we'll never live to see it.<br> Look at you.<br> I loved you more than Henry,<br> and it's cost me everything.<br> What do you want?<br> I want us back the way we<br> were. No, that's not it.<br> All right, then.<br> I want the Aquitaine.<br> That's the mother I remember.<br> We can win. I can get you Alais.<br> I can make the marriage happen, but<br> I've got to have the Aquitaine to do it.<br> I must have it back. It's<br> mine, and I'll never give it up.<br> Shall I write my will,<br> "to Richard... everything"?<br> Would you believe me then?<br> Where's paper? Paper burns.<br> I love you.<br> You love nothing.<br> You're incomplete. The human<br> parts of you are missing.<br> You're as dead<br> as you are deadly.<br> Don't leave me.<br> You were lovely once.<br> I've seen the pictures.<br> Don't you remember<br> how you loved me?<br> We were always hand in hand.<br> Here's how it felt.<br> As hot and coarse as that?<br> This won't burn.<br> I'll scratch a will on this.<br> "To Richard... everything. "<br> Mother!<br> Remember how I<br> taught you numbers...<br> and the lute and poetry?<br> See? You do remember.<br> I taught you dancing, too,<br> and languages...<br> and all the music I knew and<br> how to love what's beautiful.<br> The sun was warmer then,<br> and we were every day together.<br> William, tell the french king<br> I'll see him in the parlor.<br> Yes, my lord.<br> In half an hour.<br> Half an hour. Good.<br> Of course, you know there's not<br> a word of truth to Henry's terms.<br> If that's a warning,<br> thank you.<br> What if it's an offer?<br> "What if" is<br> a game for scholars.<br> What if angels<br> sat on pinheads?<br> What if I were king?<br> It's your game, Geoff.<br> You play it.<br> John.<br> I made this for father.<br> All the pieces work.<br> It took months. I'm not a fool.<br> I know. Now, here's my plan.<br> I read three languages.<br> I've studied law.<br> What plan?<br> We've got to make a<br> deal with Philip. Why?<br> Because you're out, and Richard's<br> in. And what kind of deal?<br> A war. If we three join and fight<br> now, we can finish Richard off.<br> You mean destroy him?<br> Hmm.<br> And mother too?<br> And mother too.<br> Now, do we do it? Is it<br> on? I've got to think.<br> You haven't time.<br> We are extra princes now.<br> You know where<br> extra princes go?<br> Down.<br> Well, does John want a war<br> or doesn't he?<br> Do you? If John asks for your<br> soldiers, will he get them?<br> If John wants a war,<br> he's got one.<br> John, you hear that?<br> I'm still thinking.<br> Let me help. It's either<br> Richard on the throne or you.<br> Do you think we'd win?<br> I know it.<br> Henry!<br> But you don't understand. I would<br> appreciate a little qulet confidence.<br> I've enough nits picking at me.<br> But you've promised me to Richard!<br> Good God,<br> you don't think I meant it?<br> So that whole scene,<br> all you said to John...<br> you think I'd ever give him up when I've<br> mothered him and fathered him and babied him?<br> He's all I've got! How often do you<br> people have to hear it... every supper?<br> Should we start the soup with<br> who we love and who we don't?<br> I think you like passing me<br> from hand to hand.<br> What am I to you...<br> a collection plate?<br> Or am I all you've got,<br> like John?<br> I've got to get<br> the Aquitaine for John.<br> - I talk people, and you answer back in provinces!<br> - They get mixed up.<br> What's the Aquitaine to Eleanor? It's<br> not a province. It's a way to torture me.<br> That's why she spent the evening<br> wooing Richard, wheezing on the coals.<br> She'll squeeze it out of him. My<br> God, I'd have loved to eavesdrop.<br> "I taught you prancing, lamb,<br> and lute and flute... "<br> That's marvelous.<br> It's absolutely me.<br> I thought as long as I was<br> coming down, I'd bring them.<br> Whatever are you giving me?<br> You're such a child.<br> You always ask.<br> "To Henry. "<br> Heavy.<br> It's my tombstone!<br> Eleanor, you spoil me.<br> I never could<br> deny you anything.<br> Don't go. It nettles her<br> to see how much I need you.<br> You need me, Henry, like a<br> tailor needs a tinker's dam.<br> Oh, I know that look.<br> He's going to say<br> he loves me.<br> Like my life.<br> I talk that way<br> to keep her spirits up.<br> Well, how'd you do with<br> Richard? Did you break his heart?<br> You think he ought to<br> give me back the Aquitaine?<br> I can't see why he shouldn't. After<br> all, I've promised him the throne.<br> The boy keeps wondering<br> if your promises are any good.<br> There's no sense asking if the air's<br> good when there's nothing else to breathe.<br> Exactly what I told him.<br> Have you got it?<br> Will he give it back?<br> No Aquitaine for John.<br> I have to give him something.<br> Isn't some agreement possible?<br> Love, in a world where carpenters<br> get resurrected, anything is possible.<br> You bore him, damn it.<br> He's your son!<br> Oh, heavens, yes.<br> I recall them all.<br> You'd only just found Rosamund.<br> Why her so damn particularly?<br> I've found other women.<br> Countless others.<br> What's your count?<br> Let's have a tally of the<br> bedspreads you've spread out on.<br> Thomas Beckett's.<br> That's a lie.<br> I know.<br> You still care what I do.<br> I want the Aquitaine for John!<br> I want it, and I'll have it.<br> Is that menace you're<br> conveying? Is it to be torture?<br> Will you boil me or stretch me...<br> which? Or am I to be perforated?<br> I have the documents,<br> and you will sign.<br> How will you force me to... threats?<br> "Sign or I refuse to feed you. "<br> Tears? "Oh, sign before<br> my heart goes crack. "<br> I'm like the earth, old man...<br> there isn't any way around me.<br> I adore you.<br> Save your aching arches.<br> That road's closed.<br> I have an offer for you,<br> my dear.<br> A deal? A deal?<br> I give the richest province on<br> the continent to John for what?<br> You tell me,<br> mastermind, for what.<br> Your freedom.<br> Oh.<br> Once Johnny gets the Aquitaine,<br> you're free. I'll let you out.<br> Think: On the loose in london,<br> winters in provence,<br> impromptu trips to visit Richard<br> anywhere he's killing people...<br> all that for a signature.<br> - You're good.<br> - I thought it might appeal. You always fancied traveling.<br> Yes.<br> I even made poor Louis<br> take me on crusade.<br> How's that for blasphemy?<br> I dressed my maids as amazons and<br> rode bare-breasted halfway to damascus.<br> Louls had a seizure, and I<br> damn near died of windburn,<br> but the troops were dazzled.<br> Henry, I'm against the wall.<br> To be a prisoner...<br> to be bricked in...<br> when you've known the world...<br> I'll never know how I survived.<br> These ten years, Henry,<br> have been unimaginable.<br> And now,<br> you offer me<br> the only thing I want...<br> if I give up...<br> the only thing I treasure.<br> Sign the paper, and we'll<br> break the happy news.<br> The queen is free, John gets the<br> Aquitaine, and Richard marries Alais.<br> Yes, let's have it done.<br> I'll sign.<br> On one condition.<br> Name it.<br> Have the wedding now.<br> What's that?<br> Why, I've surprised you.<br> Surely it's not sudden.<br> They've been marching down the aisle<br> for 16 years, and that's a long walk.<br> John can be best man.<br> That's a laugh.<br> And you can give the bride<br> away. I want to watch you do it.<br> Alais...<br> I can live without her.<br> And I thought you loved her. So I do.<br> Thank God. You frightened me.<br> I was afraid this wouldn't hurt.<br> What a tragedy you are.<br> I wonder...<br> do you ever wonder...<br> if I slept<br> with your father?<br> My father?<br> It's a lie.<br> But there are rumors.<br> Don't you ever wonder?<br> Is it rich, despising<br> me? Is it rewarding? No.<br> Then stop!<br> How?<br> It's what I live for.<br> I'll show you.<br> By christ, I will.<br> I'll do it.<br> Where's a priest?<br> Somebody dig me up a priest!<br> You!<br> Fetch me a bishop!<br> Get old Durham.<br> He's just down the hall.<br> Ask him to meet us in the<br> chapel. John, Richard, Geoffrey!<br> What's wrong? What's happened?<br> Richard's getting married.<br> Getting married? Now?<br> He's getting married now?<br> I never cease to marvel at<br> the qulckness of your mind.<br> You can't hurt me,<br> you bag of bile.<br> But you can, father.<br> Why? Because I say so.<br> My lord, the bishop's waiting in the<br> chapel. Good. Let's get this over with.<br> You'll make a lovely bride.<br> I wonder if I'll cry.<br> You sound as if you think<br> it's going to happen. I do.<br> He's only plotting. Can't you<br> tell when Henry's plotting?<br> Not this time.<br> He'll never give me up.<br> You think I won't?<br> Because you told me so.<br> You're not my helen. I won't fight<br> a war to save a face. We're done.<br> I don't believe you!<br> Wait ten minutes!<br> Please! Richard, Richard,<br> we're not...<br> honestly, we're not!<br> Please!<br> We love each other.<br> Come on! It's lunacy!<br> I won't do it! I won't!<br> - Lunacy! Let me go, Henry. Richard, no!<br> - Come on!<br> I won't say the words!<br> Not one of them!<br> It makes no sense!<br> Why give me up?<br> What do you get?<br> What are you gaining?<br> Why, the Aquitaine,<br> of course.<br> What's that again?<br> Your mother gets her freedom,<br> and I get the Aquitaine.<br> That is the proposition,<br> isn't it? You did agree.<br> Of course she did. I knew it. It<br> was all pretense. I believed it all.<br> I meant it all. No wedding.<br> There'll be no wedding.<br> But, my boy, look.<br> Durham's waiting.<br> Marry her, for my sake. It<br> isn't much to ask. Never!<br> But I promised it to Philip.<br> Think of my position.<br> Damn the wedding and to hell with<br> your position. You don't dare defy me.<br> Don't I?<br> You're the king of France, for<br> God's sake. Speak up. Do something.<br> Make a threat. Come on,<br> frighten me. Am I? Dunce!<br> He never meant<br> to have the wedding.<br> Come again. You're good at<br> rage. I like the way you play it.<br> Boy, don't ever call a king<br> a liar to his face.<br> I'm not a boy...<br> to you or anyone!<br> Boy, you came here asking<br> for a wedding or the vexin back.<br> By God, you don't get either. It's no<br> to both. You have a pact with France!<br> Then damn the pact and damn France.<br> She never marries, not while I'm alive.<br> Your life and never<br> are two different times.<br> Not on my clock, boy!<br> Listen to the lion!<br> Come on, frighten me. Don't spoil it,<br> Richard. Take it like a good sport.<br> How's your bad leg?<br> Better, thank you.<br> Your bad back? You're getting<br> old. You'll have me once too often.<br> When? I'm 50 now. My God,<br> boy, I'm the oldest man I know.<br> I've got a decade<br> on the pope.<br> What's it to be? The<br> broadsword when I'm 85?<br> I'm not a second son now. Your<br> Henry's lies in the vault, you know.<br> I know.<br> I've seen him there.<br> I'll have the crown. You'll<br> have what daddy gives you.<br> I am next in line!<br> To nothing!<br> Then we'll only have the<br> broadswords now. This minute?<br> No, on the battlefield!<br> So we're at war?<br> Yes, we're at war. I have 2,000<br> men at poitiers. Can they hear you?<br> Call and see who answers. You're<br> as close to poitiers as you'll get.<br> You don't dare hold me prisoner. Until we're<br> all agreed John comes next, I can and will.<br> You're a king's son, so I treat you with<br> respect. You have the freedom of the castle.<br> The castle doesn't stand that<br> holds me. Post your guards.<br> My God, I'm king again.<br> Fantastic.<br> Are you happy for me, Geoff?<br> I'm happy for us both.<br> You played it nicely.<br> You were good.<br> Yes, I was.<br> I fooled you, didn't I?<br> Oh, God, but I do love<br> being king.<br> Well, Henry,<br> liege and lord,<br> what happens now?<br> I've no idea.<br> I know I'm winning, and I know I'll<br> win, but what the next move is...<br> you were scared,<br> weren't you?<br> No.<br> I think you were.<br> I was. You mustn't play with<br> feelings, Henry. Not with mine.<br> It wasn't possible<br> to lose you.<br> I must hold you dearer<br> than I thought.<br> You've got your enigmatic face<br> on. What's your mood, I wonder?<br> Pure delight.<br> I'm locked up<br> with my sons.<br> What mother does not<br> dream of that?<br> One thing.<br> Yes?<br> May I watch you kiss her?<br> Can't you ever stop?<br> I watch you every night.<br> I conjure it<br> before I sleep.<br> Leave it there.<br> My curiosity<br> is intellectual.<br> I want to see<br> how accurate I am.<br> Forget the dragon<br> in the doorway. Come.<br> Believe I love you,<br> for I do.<br> Believe I'm yours forever,<br> for I am.<br> Believe in my contentment<br> and the joy you give me.<br> And believe...<br> you want more?<br> I'm an old man<br> in an empty place.<br> Be with me.<br> How beautiful you make me.<br> What might solomon have sung<br> had he seen this.<br> I can't.<br> I'd turn to salt.<br> I've lost again.<br> I'm done for this time.<br> Well, there'll be<br> other Christmases.<br> I'd hang you from the nipples,<br> but you'd shock the children.<br> They kissed sweetly,<br> didn't they?<br> I'll have him next time.<br> I can wait.<br> Ah, there you are!<br> My comfort<br> and my company.<br> We're locked in<br> for another year.<br> Four seasons more.<br> What a desolation.<br> What a life's work.<br> Is it too much?<br> Be sure to squlnt<br> as you approach.<br> You may be blinded<br> by my beauty.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Is that why you're here...<br> to tell me that?<br> I thought<br> you might be lonely.<br> Here, chancellor.<br> Try it on for size.<br> It's puzzling.<br> I remember my third birthday.<br> Not just pictures<br> of the garden or the gifts,<br> but who did what to whom<br> and how it felt.<br> My memory stretches that far back,<br> but never once can I remember...<br> anything from you or father<br> warmer than indifference.<br> Why is that?<br> I don't know.<br> That was not an easy question from me,<br> and I don't deserve and easy answer.<br> There are times I think we<br> loved none of our children.<br> Still too easy,<br> don't you think?<br> I'm weary, and you want<br> a simple answer,<br> and I haven't one.<br> I'm so sick<br> of all of you.<br> I thought I'd come<br> and gloat a little.<br> Mother's tired. Come stick<br> pins tomorrow morning.<br> I'll be<br> more responsive then.<br> It's no fun goading anyone<br> tonight. Bastard's boxed us up.<br> What's that, dear? We're his<br> prisoners, if that interests you.<br> Why should it?<br> I'm his prisoner anyway?<br> It was... correct me<br> if I'm wrong...<br> but it was my impression that<br> you wanted Henry's throne for me.<br> We can't win, Richard.<br> We've lost it this time.<br> You think I'm finished, do you? So I do.<br> I've suffered more defeats<br> than you have teeth.<br> I know one<br> when it happens to me.<br> Take your wormwood like a good<br> boy. Swallow it and go to bed.<br> I will be king. So you<br> will, but not this year!<br> Oh, leave it, Richard!<br> Let it go for now.<br> I can't.<br> It's not so hard.<br> Try saying after me:<br> John wins, I lose.<br> And what if John died?<br> You wouldn't dare! A<br> knife. Why wouldn't I?<br> He's got a knife! Of course he<br> has a knife. He always has a knife.<br> We all have knives. It's<br> How clear we make it. Oh, my<br> piglets, we are the origins of war.<br> Not history's forces, nor the times,<br> nor justice, nor the lack of it,<br> nor causes, nor religions,<br> nor ideas,<br> nor kinds of government,<br> nor any other thing.<br> Weare the killers.<br> Webreed wars.<br> We carry it,<br> like syphilis, inside.<br> Dead bodies rot in field and stream<br> because the living ones are rotten.<br> For the love of God, can't we<br> love one another just a little?<br> That's how peace begins.<br> We have so much<br> to love each other for.<br> We have such possibilities,<br> my children.<br> We could change the world.<br> And while we hugged each other,<br> what would Philip do?<br> Oh, good God, Philip!<br> We're supposed to start a war. If<br> father finds out, I'll be rulned.<br> Steady, John. Don't panic.<br> Some adviser you are.<br> Don't do anything without me. Let me<br> handle it. He's made a pact with Philip.<br> You advised John into making<br> war. That fearless boy...<br> he's disinherited himself.<br> When Henry finds out... when<br> I tell him what John's done...<br> I need a little time. Can you keep<br> John from Philip till I say so?<br> Anything you say. Richard, I want<br> you out of here before this breaks.<br> And that means Philip.<br> Go to him, be desperate.<br> Promise anything...<br> the vexin, brittany.<br> Once you're free and John is out<br> of favor, we'll make further plans.<br> You see Philip. You're the diplomat.<br> You see him, you talk to him.<br> You're a friend.<br> You know him, I don't.<br> And Richard!<br> Promise anything.<br> I've got the old boy<br> this time.<br> The damn fool thinks he<br> loves John. He believes it.<br> That's where the knife<br> goes in...<br> knives.<br> Knives.<br> Where is that mirror? I'm Eleanor,<br> and I can look at anything.<br> My, what a lovely girl.<br> How could her king<br> have left her?<br> Philip?<br> Philip!<br> It's working out. By morning,<br> I can be the chosen son.<br> The crown can come to me. Are you still<br> with me? We'll have to fight them all.<br> They'll band together once this<br> happens. Have I got your word?<br> Do I have yours? All England's<br> land in France if I support you?<br> Are we allies then?<br> We were born to be.<br> I should say something solemn,<br> but I haven't the time.<br> I'm off to father with news that<br> John's a traitor. After that...<br> you stink! You know that?<br> You're a stinker, and you stink.<br> I'll kill you!<br> Ah!<br> Lump.<br> If you're a prince, there's<br> hope for every ape in africa.<br> I had you saved. I wasn't on<br> my way to father, but he was.<br> He would have gone to Henry and<br> betrayed you. Look, it's in his face.<br> It's true. I don't know<br> who my friends are.<br> Philip?<br> May we? That's what tapestries are for.<br> I'll never learn.<br> I'll ruln everything.<br> Richard?<br> Hello, Richard.<br> You're halfway to bed. I'll<br> wait for morning. Come in.<br> Mother sent me.<br> Come in anyway.<br> Our alchemists have stumbled<br> on the art of boiling burgundy.<br> It turns to steam, and when it<br> cools, we call it brandywine.<br> I'm Henry's prisoner.<br> You find that charming?<br> No. Then why the charming smile?<br> I thought,<br> I can't think why,<br> of when you were<br> in paris last.<br> Can it be two whole years<br> ago? It can. I need an army.<br> It'll take the cold away.<br> I must have soldiers.<br> Have I aged?<br> Do I seem older to you?<br> They've been two fierce years. I've<br> studied, and I've trained to be a king.<br> I'll have your answer... yes or<br> no? You'll have it when I give it.<br> You see?<br> I've changed.<br> I'm not the boy you taught to<br> hunt two years ago. Remember?<br> Racing after boar,<br> you flying first,<br> me scrambling after,<br> all day into dusk.<br> Don't go. I must know. Will you help me?<br> Sit and we'll discuss it.<br> You never write.<br> To anyone.<br> Why should I make you<br> king of England?<br> Aren't I better off<br> with John or Geoffrey?<br> Why have you to fight when I<br> could have the cretin or the fiend?<br> Would we fight? We're<br> fighting now. Good night.<br> You're still a boy.<br> In some ways.<br> Which way did you have in mind?<br> You haven't asked how much your<br> help is worth. You'll tell me.<br> You can have the vexin back.<br> And what else?<br> All of brittany. Does that<br> matter? That's Geoffrey's.<br> Possibly to Geoffrey. And what<br> else? That's all your help is worth.<br> And in return,<br> what do you want from me?<br> Two thousand soldiers.<br> - And what else?<br> - Five hundred knights on horse.<br> - And what else?<br> - Arms and siege equlpment.<br> - And what else?<br> - I never wrote because I thought you'd never answer.<br> You got married.<br> Does that make a difference? Doesn't it?<br> I've spent two years<br> on every street in hell.<br> That's odd.<br> I never saw you there.<br> You haven't said<br> you loved me.<br> When the time comes.<br> Shh.<br> It's not too late<br> at night?<br> I'd hoped you'd come.<br> Good!<br> We couldn't leave negotiations<br> where they were.<br> Ah!<br> I keep looking for your<br> father in you. He's not there.<br> I'll miss him.<br> Has Richard or the queen<br> been here to see you?<br> Does it matter? If they<br> haven't yet, they will.<br> I want to reach a settlement. I<br> left you with too little earlier.<br> Yes.<br> Nothing is too little.<br> I'm sorry<br> you're not fonder of me, lad.<br> Your father always said,<br> "be fond of stronger men. "<br> No wonder<br> he loved everyone.<br> I've come to you<br> to offer peace.<br> Piss on your peace.<br> Your father would have wept.<br> My father was a weeper.<br> Fight me, and you'll lose.<br> I can't lose, Henry.<br> I have time.<br> Why, just look at you.<br> Great heavy arms. But each<br> year they get a little heavier.<br> The sand goes pit-pat<br> in the glass.<br> I'm in no hurry, Henry.<br> I've got time.<br> Suppose I hurry things along. Suppose I<br> say that England is at war with France.<br> Then France surrenders. I<br> don't have to fight to win.<br> Take all you want... this county,<br> that one. You won't keep it long.<br> What kind of courage<br> have you got?<br> The tidal kind...<br> it comes and goes.<br> By God, I'd love to turn you<br> loose on Eleanor. More brandywine?<br> You recognize it? They were boiling<br> it in ireland before the snakes left.<br> Well, things look a little bleak<br> for Henry, don't they?<br> You'll say yes to Richard when he<br> comes... arms, soldiers, anything he asks.<br> I'd be foolish not to.<br> Yeah.<br> And withdraw it all before the battle<br> ever started. Wouldn't you, in my place?<br> Why fight Henry when his sons<br> will do it for you?<br> Yes, exactly.<br> - You've got promise, lad. That's<br> first-class thinking. - Thank you, sir.<br> Good night. Good night? You're<br> going? We haven't settled anything.<br> We open Christmas presents at noon.<br> Till then. You can't be finished with me.<br> Oh, but I am. It's been most<br> satisfactory. What's so satisfactory?<br> Winning is. I did just<br> win. Surely you noticed.<br> Not a thing. You<br> haven't won a damn thing.<br> Hmm.<br> I found out the way your mind<br> works and the kind of man you are.<br> I know your plans<br> and expectations.<br> You've burbled every bit<br> of strategy you've got.<br> I know exactly what you will do<br> and exactly what you won't.<br> And I've told you<br> exactly nothing!<br> To these aged eyes, boy, that's<br> what winning looks like! Dormez bien.<br> You...<br> you made my father nothing.<br> You were always better.<br> You bullied him,<br> you bellied with his wife,<br> you beat him down<br> in every war,<br> you twisted every treaty,<br> you played mock the monk,<br> and then you made him<br> love you for it.<br> I was there.<br> His last words<br> went to you.<br> He was a loving man, and you've<br> learned nothing of it.<br> I learned how much fathers<br> live in sons.<br> A king like you has policy<br> prepared on everything.<br> What's the official line<br> on sodomy?<br> How stands the crown<br> on boys who do with boys?<br> Richard finds his way<br> into so many legends.<br> Let's hear yours<br> and see how it compares.<br> He found me first<br> when I was 15.<br> We were hunting.<br> It was nearly dark.<br> My horse fell,<br> I was thrown.<br> I woke to Richard<br> touching me.<br> He asked me<br> if I loved him.<br> "Philip, do you love me?"<br> And I told him, "yes. "<br> Do you know why<br> I told him yes?<br> So that one day I could<br> tell you all about it.<br> You cannot imagine<br> what that "yes" cost.<br> Imagine snuggling<br> to a chancred whore...<br> and bending back your lips into<br> something like a smile, saying,<br> "yes,<br> "I love you,<br> "and I find you...<br> beautiful. "<br> I don't know how I did it.<br> - No! It wasn't like that!<br> - But it was.<br> You loved me.<br> Never.<br> Get out. Please.<br> I don't want you here.<br> It's no great pleasure<br> to be here.<br> So the royal corkscrew<br> finds me twisted, does he?<br> I'll go tell your mother. She'll<br> be pleased. She knows. She sent me.<br> How completely hers you are.<br> You've had four sons.<br> Who do you claim?<br> Not Henry.<br> Not my buried brother.<br> Not that monument to muck,<br> that epic idiot.<br> Why him? Why always him and never me?<br> He was the eldest.<br> He came first.<br> Christ, Henry,<br> is that all?<br> You went with Eleanor.<br> You never called me.<br> You never said my name.<br> I'd have walked. I'd have<br> crawled. I'd have done anything.<br> It's not my fault.<br> I won't be blamed.<br> I only wanted you.<br> No, my crown. You want my<br> kingdom. You keep your kingdom.<br> That I will.<br> I hope it kills you.<br> Thank God I have another son.<br> Thank God for John.<br> And who shall we thank for<br> Geoffrey? You don't think much of me.<br> "Much"? I don't think<br> of you at all.<br> Nurse used to say<br> I had your hands.<br> I might have had more of you.<br> Try seeing me.<br> I haven't Richard's military skill,<br> but he was here betraying you, not I.<br> I haven't John's... God knows what you<br> see in John... and he's betrayed you too.<br> You think I'd ever<br> make you king?<br> You'll make me king<br> because I'm all you've got.<br> I was to be his chancellor.<br> Ask him why. I've heard enough.<br> For moving John<br> to treason.<br> I don't doubt he offered,<br> I don't doubt you tried,<br> and I don't doubt<br> John loves me.<br> Like a glutton<br> loves his lunch.<br> You turd.<br> Well, John?<br> It isn't what you think.<br> What do I think?<br> What Geoffrey said. I wouldn't<br> plot against you, ever.<br> I know.<br> You're a good boy.<br> Can I go now, please? It's<br> late. I ought to be in bed.<br> Couldn't you wait? Couldn't<br> you trust me? It was all yours.<br> Couldn't you believe that?<br> Will you listen to the grief?<br> Who do you think I bullt<br> this kingdom for? Me!<br> Daddy did it all for me.<br> When can I have it, daddy?<br> Not until we bury you?<br> - I loved you.<br> - You're a cold and bloody bastard, you are.<br> And you don't love anything.<br> I'm it.<br> I'm all that's left.<br> Here, father.<br> Here I am.<br> My life, when it is written,<br> will read better than it lived.<br> Henry fitz-empress, first<br> plantagenet, a king at 21,<br> the ablest soldier<br> of an able time.<br> He led men well, he cared<br> for justice when he could...<br> and ruled, for 30 years, a state<br> as great as charlemagne's.<br> He married out of love<br> a woman out of legend.<br> Not in alexandria or rome or<br> camelot has there been such a queen.<br> She bore him many children,<br> but no sons.<br> King Henry had no sons.<br> He had three whiskered things,<br> but he disowned them.<br> You're not mine!<br> We're not connected!<br> I deny you!<br> None of you will get my kingdom.<br> I leave you nothing!<br> And I wish you plague! May all<br> your children breech and die!<br> My boys are gone.<br> I've lost my boys.<br> You dare to damn me,<br> do you?<br> Well, I'll damn you back.<br> Goddamn you!<br> My boys are gone.<br> I've lost my boys.<br> Oh, jesus.<br> All my boys.<br> Henry?<br> The Christmas wine<br> is in the pot<br> The Christmas coals<br> are red<br> I'll spend my day<br> the lover's way<br> Unwrapping all my gifts<br> In bed<br> The Christmas mass<br> Is over now<br> The Christmas prayers<br> are done<br> No one else is caroling.<br> It might as well be lent.<br> When I was little, Christmas was<br> a time of great confusion to me.<br> The holy land had two kings...<br> God and uncle raymond.<br> I never knew whose birthday<br> we were celebrating.<br> Henry isn't here. Good, we<br> can talk behind his back.<br> What happened?<br> Don't you know?<br> There was a scene with beds and<br> tapestries, and many things got said.<br> Spiced wine.<br> I'd forgotten Henry liked it.<br> May I stay?<br> It's your room just as much as<br> mine. We're both in residence.<br> Packed in like the poor,<br> three to a bed.<br> Did you love Henry...<br> ever?<br> Ever? Back before the flood?<br> As long ago as rosamund.<br> Ah, that's prehistory, lamb. There<br> are no written records or survivors.<br> There are pictures. She was<br> prettier than you. Oh, much.<br> Her eyes, in certain light, were<br> violet, and all her teeth were even.<br> That's a rare, fair feature...<br> even teeth.<br> She smiled to excess, but she<br> chewed with real distinction.<br> And you hate her<br> even now.<br> No, but I did.<br> He put her in my place, you see,<br> and that was very hard.<br> Like you, she headed Henry's<br> table. That's my chair.<br> And so<br> you had her poisoned.<br> No, I never poisoned rosamund.<br> Oh, I prayed for her to drop...<br> and smiled a little<br> when she did.<br> Why aren't you happy?<br> Henry's keeping you. You<br> must be cleverer than I am.<br> I've tried feeling pity<br> for you,<br> but it keeps on turning<br> into something else.<br> Why pity?<br> You love Henry, but you<br> love his kingdom too.<br> You look at him,<br> and you see cities,<br> acreage, coastline,<br> taxes.<br> All I see is Henry.<br> Leave him to me,<br> can't you?<br> I left him years ago.<br> And I thought<br> I could move you.<br> Were you always<br> like this?<br> When I was young and worshipped<br> you, is this what you were like?<br> Most likely.<br> Child, I'm finished, and I've come<br> to give him anything he asks for.<br> Do you know what I<br> should like for Christmas?<br> I should like<br> to see you suffer.<br> Alais, just for you.<br> Alors, ma petite.<br> J'ai peur, maman.<br> No, no.<br> The sky is pocked with stars.<br> What eyes the wise men must have<br> had to see a new one in so many.<br> You look cold. I've mulled some wine.<br> I wonder...<br> were there fewer stars then?<br> I don't know. I fancy<br> there's a mystery in it.<br> What's this?<br> Warm wine.<br> Why, so it is.<br> You are as beautiful<br> as I remembered.<br> Off you go.<br> My widow wants to see me.<br> She came to find out what<br> your plans are. I know.<br> She wants you back.<br> Go to your room.<br> So, you want me back.<br> She thinks I do.<br> She thinks the need<br> for loving never stops.<br> She has a point.<br> I marvel at you.<br> After all these years,<br> still like a democratic drawbridge,<br> going down for everybody.<br> At my age, there's not<br> much traffic anymore.<br> To your interminable health.<br> - Well, wife, what's on your mind?<br> - I've just seen Richard.<br> Splendid boy.<br> He says you fought.<br> We always do.<br> It's his impression that<br> you mean to disinherit them.<br> I fancy I'll relent.<br> Don't you?<br> I don't much care.<br> In fact, I wonder, Henry,<br> if I care for anything.<br> I wonder if I'm hungry<br> out of habit.<br> I could listen to you lie<br> for hours.<br> So your lust is rusty.<br> Gorgeous.<br> Henry, I'm so tired.<br> Sleep then. Sleep and<br> dream of me withcroutons.<br> Henri a la mode.<br> - Henry, stop it.<br> - Eleanor, I haven't started.<br> What do you want? You want my<br> name on paper? I'll sign anything.<br> You want the Aquitaine<br> for John? It's John's.<br> It's his, it's yours, it's<br> anybody's. In exchange for what?<br> For nothing.<br> For a little qulet.<br> For an end to this,<br> for God's sake.<br> Sail me back to England,<br> lock me up...<br> and lose the key<br> and let me be alone.<br> You have my oath.<br> I give my word.<br> Oh, well.<br> Well, well.<br> Would you like a pillow?<br> Footstool? How about a shawl?<br> Your oaths are all profanities, your words a<br> curse, your name on paper is a waste of pulp!<br> I'm vilifying you, for<br> God's sake! Pay attention!<br> How,<br> from where we started,<br> did we ever reach<br> this Christmas?<br> Step by step.<br> What happens to me now?<br> That's lively curiosity<br> from such a dead cat.<br> If you want to know<br> my plans, just ask me.<br> Conquer china, sack the<br> vatican, or take the veil.<br> I'm not among the ones<br> who give a damn.<br> Just let me sign my lands<br> to John and go to bed.<br> No, you're too kind.<br> I can't accept.<br> Come on, man, I'll sign the thing<br> in blood or spit or bright blue ink.<br> Let's have it done.<br> Let's not.<br> No, I don't think I want<br> your signature on anything.<br> You don't?<br> Dear God,<br> the pleasure I still get<br> from goading you.<br> You don't want John to have<br> my provinces? Bull's-eye.<br> I can't bear you when<br> you're smug. I know, I know.<br> You don't want Richard, and you<br> don't want John. You've grasped it.<br> All right, then,<br> shatter me!<br> Let me have it.<br> What do you want?<br> A new wife.<br> Oh.<br> So,<br> I'm to be annulled.<br> Well,<br> will the pope annul me,<br> do you think?<br> The pontiff owes me one<br> pontificate. I think he will.<br> Out Eleanor,<br> in alais.<br> - Why?<br> - A new wife, wife, will bear me sons.<br> That is the single thing...<br> of which I would have thought<br> you had enough.<br> I want a son.<br> We could populate...<br> a country town with country<br> girls who've borne you sons.<br> How many is it?<br> Help me count the bastards.<br> All my sons are bastards.<br> You really mean to do it.<br> Lady love, with all my heart.<br> Your sons are part of you.<br> Like warts and goiters,<br> and I'm having them removed.<br> We've made them.<br> They're our boys.<br> I know, and good God,<br> look at them.<br> Geoffrey...<br> there's a masterpiece.<br> He isn't flesh, he's a device.<br> He's wheels and gears.<br> And johnny...<br> was his latest treason<br> your idea?<br> I caught him lying,<br> and I've said, "he's young. "<br> I found him cheating, and<br> I've said, "he's just a boy. "<br> I've watched him steal and whore and<br> whip his servants, and he's not a child.<br> He's the man we made him.<br> Don't share John with me.<br> He's your accomplishment.<br> And Richard's yours.<br> How could you send him off<br> to deal with Philip?<br> I was tired.<br> I was busy.<br> They were friends.<br> Eleanor, he was the best.<br> From the cradle on, you cradled<br> him. I never had a chance.<br> You never wanted one. How<br> do you know? You took him.<br> Separation from your husband<br> you could bear, but not your son.<br> Whatever I have done,<br> you made me do.<br> You threw me out of bed<br> for Richard.<br> Not until you threw me out<br> for rosamund.<br> It's not that simple. I won't<br> have it to be that simple.<br> I adored you.<br> Never.<br> I still do.<br> Of all the lies,<br> that one is the most terrible.<br> I know. That's why<br> I saved it up for now.<br> Oh, Henry, we've mangled<br> everything we've touched.<br> Deny us what you will,<br> we have done that.<br> Do you remember when we met?<br> Down to the hour<br> and color of your stockings.<br> I could hardly see you<br> for the sunlight.<br> It was raining,<br> but no matter.<br> There was very little talk,<br> as I recall.<br> Very little.<br> I had never seen<br> such beauty.<br> I walked right up<br> and touched it.<br> God, where did I find<br> the gall to do that?<br> In my eyes.<br> I loved you.<br> No annulment.<br> What? There will be no annulment.<br> Will there not? No, I'm afraid<br> you'll have to do without.<br> Well, it was<br> just a whim.<br> I'm so relieved.<br> I didn't want to lose you.<br> Out of curiosity, as<br> intellectual to intellectual,<br> how in the name of bleeding<br> jesus can you lose me?<br> Do we ever see each other?<br> Am I ever near you?<br> Ever with you? Am I ever<br> anywhere but somewhere else?<br> Do I write?<br> Do we send messages?<br> Do dinghies bearing gifts float up<br> the thames to you? Are you remembered?<br> You are.<br> You're no part of me. We<br> do not touch at any point.<br> How can you lose me?<br> Can't you feel the chains?<br> You know me well enough<br> to know I can't be stopped.<br> I don't have to stop you.<br> I have only to delay you.<br> Every enemy you have has friends<br> in rome. We'll cost you time.<br> What is this?<br> I'm not moldering.<br> My paint's not peeling. I'm<br> good for years. How many years?<br> Suppose I hold you back for one.<br> I can. It's possible.<br> Suppose your first son dies.<br> Ours did. It's possible.<br> Suppose you're daughtered next.<br> We were.<br> That, too,<br> is possible.<br> How old is daddy then?<br> What kind of spindly,<br> rickett-ridden, milky,<br> wizened, dim-eyed,<br> gammy-handed, limpy line<br> of things will you beget?<br> It's sweet of you to care.<br> And when you die, which is<br> regrettable but necessary,<br> what will happen to frail alais<br> and her pruney prince?<br> You can't think Richard's going<br> to wait for your grotesque to grow.<br> You wouldn't let him<br> do a thing like that?<br> Let him? I'd push him<br> through the nursery door.<br> You're not that cruel.<br> Don't fret. We'll wait<br> until you're dead to do it.<br> Eleanor, what do you want?<br> Just what you want...<br> a king for a son.<br> You can make more, I can't.<br> You think I want to disappear?<br> One son is all I've got, and you<br> can blot him out and call me cruel?<br> For these ten years, you've<br> lived with everything I've lost...<br> and loved another woman<br> through it all, and I am cruel?<br> I could peel you like a pear,<br> and God himself<br> would call it justice.<br> I will die sometime soon.<br> One day I'll duck too slow,<br> and at westminster,<br> they'll sing out "long live<br> the king" for someone else.<br> I beg you, let it be<br> a son of mine.<br> I am not moved to tears.<br> I have no sons. You have too<br> many sons. You don't need more.<br> Well, wish me luck.<br> I'm off.<br> To rome? That's where<br> they keep the pope.<br> You don't dare go!<br> Say that again at noon.<br> You'll say it to my horse's ass.<br> Lamb, I'll be rid of you by easter!<br> You can count your reigning days!<br> You go to rome,<br> we'll rise against you!<br> Who will? Richard, Geoffrey,<br> John and Eleanor of Aquitaine.<br> The day those stout hearts band<br> together is the day that pigs get wings!<br> There'll be pork in the treetops<br> come morning!<br> Don't you see you've given them<br> a common cause: New sons?<br> You leave the country,<br> and you've lost it.<br> - All of you at once?<br> - And Philip too. He'd join us.<br> Yes, he would.<br> Now how's your trip<br> to rome?<br> Oh, I've got you,<br> got you, got you.<br> Should I take a thousand<br> men-at-arms, or is that showy?<br> Bluff away.<br> Ah, poor thing. How can I break<br> the news? You've just miscalculated.<br> Have I? How?<br> You should have lied. You should have<br> promised to be good while I was gone.<br> I would have let your three boys<br> loose. They could have fought me then.<br> You wouldn't keep your sons<br> locked up here.<br> Why the devil wouldn't I?<br> You wouldn't dare.<br> Why not? Let them sit in<br> chinon for a while. I forbid it.<br> She forbids it. Did your father<br> sleep with me, or didn't he?<br> No doubt you're going to tell me<br> that he did. Would it upset you?<br> What about the thousand men? I<br> say be gaudy and to hell with it.<br> Don't leave me, Henry. I'm at rock<br> bottom. I'll do anything to keep you.<br> I think you think you<br> mean it. Ask for something.<br> Eleanor, we're passed it, years<br> passed. Test me. Name an act.<br> There isn't one! About my<br> fornication with your father.<br> Yes, there is. You can expire. You first,<br> old man. I only hope I'm there to watch.<br> You're so afraid of dying. You're<br> so scared of it. Ah, poor Eleanor.<br> If only she'd lied. She did. She<br> said she never loved your father.<br> I can always count on you.<br> I never touched you without<br> thinking, "Geoffrey, Geoffrey. "<br> The day you hurt me,<br> I'll cry out.<br> I've put more horns on you<br> than Louis ever wore.<br> Am I supposed to care?<br> I'll kill you if you leave me.<br> You can try. I loved your<br> father's body. He was beautiful.<br> It never happened. I can see his<br> body now. Shall I describe it?<br> Eleanor, I hope you die!<br> His arms were rough,<br> with scars here.<br> No!<br> I can feel his arms!<br> I feel them!<br> I feel it!<br> What?<br> Have I hurt you?<br> Let me finish!<br> You were in the next room<br> when he did it!<br> Well,<br> what family doesn't have<br> its ups and downs?<br> I'm cold.<br> I can't feel anything.<br> Not anything at all.<br> We couldn't go back,<br> could we, Henry?<br> William!<br> Up! Up!<br> When the king is off his ass,<br> nobody sleeps!<br> Up! Up!<br> Up! Up!<br> Tell her to pack. She<br> leaves when it's light.<br> Up, up!<br> - Henry?<br> - We're packing up and moving out.<br> Is there a war? What's happened?<br> Henry, what's the matter?<br> Nothing, for a change.<br> Would you believe it?<br> Where have you been all night?<br> What for? Making us an entourage.<br> We're off to rome<br> to see the pope.<br> He's excommunicated you again.<br> No, he's going to set me free.<br> I'm having Eleanor annulled.<br> The nation will be shocked to learn<br> our marriage wasn't consummated.<br> Oh, be serious.<br> I am.<br> It seems that you and I<br> are getting married.<br> By the pope himself.<br> You mean it?<br> Shall I kneel?<br> It's not another trick? The bridal<br> party's drilling on the cobblestones.<br> - She'll find a way to stop us.<br> - How? She won't be here.<br> We're launching her for salisbury<br> tower when the winds change.<br> She'll be barging down<br> the river by lunchtime.<br> If she doesn't stop us,<br> Richard will.<br> Not anymore, I've corked him up. He's in<br> the cellar with his brothers and the wine.<br> The royal boys are aging with the<br> royal port. You haven't said yes.<br> Would you like<br> a formal declaration?<br> There, my finest angle.<br> It's on all the coins.<br> Sad alais,<br> will you marry me?<br> Be my queen.<br> We'll love each other,<br> and you'll give me sons.<br> Let's have six. We'll<br> do Eleanor one better.<br> We'll call the first one<br> Louis, if you like.<br> Louls le premier. How's<br> that for a king of England?<br> Henry, you can't ever<br> let them out.<br> You've lost me. Let who out? Your sons.<br> You've put them in the dungeon, and<br> you've got to keep them there forever.<br> Do I now? If they're free when you die,<br> it's the dungeon<br> or the nunnery for me.<br> But, Henry,<br> what about the child?<br> Don't bother me about the child.<br> The damn thing isn't born yet.<br> If they're free,<br> they'll kill it.<br> And I will not live to see<br> our children murdered.<br> Henry!<br> Are you going down?<br> To let them out<br> or to keep them in?<br> Could you say<br> to a child of yours,<br> "you've seen the sunlight<br> for the last time"?<br> Can you do it, Henry?<br> I shall have to,<br> shan't I?<br> He's here.<br> He'll get no satisfaction out of<br> me. He isn't going to see me beg.<br> Why, you chivalric fool, as if<br> the way one fell down mattered.<br> When the fall is all there is,<br> it matters.<br> My barge is sailing<br> with the tide.<br> - I've come to say good-bye.<br> - Does Henry know you're here?<br> I've brought you each a little<br> something. What's he planning?<br> Is he going to keep us here? For God's<br> sake, mother. I picked it out especially.<br> - How heavy is the outside guard?<br> - That's taken care of.<br> The courtyard, the gates? They're putting<br> Henry's train together, and it's chaos.<br> You can walk right out. We'll go<br> to poitiers. He'll expect that.<br> But we'll meet him with an army<br> when he comes. You stick close to me.<br> When you run, run hard. Why run<br> at all? I think we ought to stay.<br> Stay here? Till Henry comes.<br> He will come, won't he?<br> And he'll come alone.<br> I count three knives to<br> one. You think we could?<br> I'd only do it wrong.<br> You kill him, I'll watch.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Up for air.<br> Don't stop her. You don't<br> think I'm gonna let this happen.<br> If you tell, there'll be a rash of<br> executions, and you don't want that.<br> No, you don't want to lose<br> one of us, not even me.<br> You're clever, but I<br> wonder if you're right.<br> Warn him, it's the end of us. You<br> warn him not, it's the end of him.<br> It's that clear.<br> Take the knives and run.<br> No, Geoffrey's right.<br> You're not an assassin.<br> Look again.<br> Richard.<br> Spare me that. You brought these<br> things. You want him dead? You do it.<br> You unnatural animal.<br> Unnatural, mummy? You tell<br> me, what's nature's way?<br> If poison mushrooms grow and<br> babies come with crooked backs,<br> if goiters thrive<br> and dogs go mad...<br> and wives kill husbands,<br> what's unnatural?<br> Come, here stands your lamb. Come<br> cover him in kisses. He's all yours.<br> No, you're not mine.<br> I'm not responsible.<br> Where do you think I learned this<br> from? Who do you think I studied under?<br> How old was I when you fought with<br> Henry first? Young. I don't know.<br> How many battles did I watch? But those<br> were battles, not a knife behind a door.<br> I never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold.<br> What were you thinking when you fought him?<br> You. I did it all for you!<br> Of your unnatural animal?<br> You wanted father dead.<br> No, never that.<br> You tried to kill him.<br> Why? What did you want? Yes!<br> I wanted Henry back.<br> Liar!<br> I wanted Henry.<br> Don't trust her. She'll<br> warn him if she gets a chance.<br> Dear, dear, whatever<br> shall we do with mother?<br> It wants light.<br> What we do in dungeons<br> needs the shades of day.<br> I stole the candles<br> from the chapel.<br> Jesus won't begrudge them,<br> and the chaplain works for me.<br> You look dreadful.<br> So do you.<br> I underslept a little.<br> We can all rest<br> in a little while.<br> There, that's better.<br> Bright and clear,<br> just like the morning.<br> Fine looking boy.<br> What do you want from us?<br> You must be mad.<br> Why did you have to come here?<br> Damn it, why did you come?<br> You were the best.<br> I told her so.<br> You, I loved.<br> You're going to keep us here.<br> You can't ever let me out.<br> You know you can't.<br> I'll never stop.<br> I can't stop either.<br> Brave boys...<br> that's what I have.<br> Come for me.<br> What's wrong?<br> You're Richard, aren't you?<br> But you're Henry.<br> Please, take me back.<br> Can't we try again?<br> Again?<br> We always have before.<br> Oh, yes,<br> we always have.<br> Go on!<br> Execute him.<br> They're assassins,<br> aren't they?<br> This was treason, wasn't it?<br> You gave them life.<br> You take it.<br> Who's to say it's monstrous?<br> I'm the king. I call it just.<br> Therefore, I, Henry,<br> by the grace of God,<br> king of the english, lord of<br> scotland, ireland and wales,<br> count of anjou, brittany,<br> poutou and normandy,<br> maine,<br> gascony and Aquitaine,<br> do sentence you to death.<br> Done this Christmas day<br> in chinon in God's year 1183.<br> Surely that's not<br> what I intended.<br> Children.<br> Children.<br> They're all we have.<br> Go on.<br> I'm done.<br> I'm finished with you.<br> You and I are finished.<br> You spare the rod,<br> you'll spoil those boys.<br> I couldn't do it, Eleanor.<br> Nobody thought you could.<br> Come rest.<br> I want no women in<br> my life. You're tired.<br> I could have conquered europe,<br> all of it,<br> but I had women in my life.<br> Go on, get out.<br> Go on.<br> I should have<br> killed you years ago.<br> You put me here. You made me<br> do mad things. You've bled me.<br> Shoulder it yourself.<br> Don't put it on my back.<br> Pick it up and carry it.<br> I can.<br> My losses are my work.<br> What losses?<br> I'm the one with nothing.<br> Lost your life's work,<br> have you?<br> Provinces are nothing.<br> Land is dirt.<br> I could take defeats like<br> yours and laugh. I've done it.<br> If you're broken,<br> it's because you're brittle.<br> I've lost.<br> You won.<br> And I can't ever<br> have you back again.<br> You're all<br> that I have ever loved.<br> Christ, you don't know<br> what nothing is.<br> I want to die.<br> No, you don't.<br> I want to die.<br> I'll hold you.<br> Henry, I want to die.<br> Eleanor.<br> I want to die.<br> Let me hold you.<br> I want to die.<br> You will, you know,<br> someday.<br> Just wait long enough,<br> and it'll happen.<br> So it will.<br> We're in the cellar,<br> you're going back to prison,<br> my life is wasted,<br> we've lost each other,<br> and you're smiling.<br> It's the way<br> I register despair.<br> There's everything in life<br> but hope.<br> We're both alive.<br> And for all I know,<br> that's what hope is.<br> We're jungle creatures,<br> Henry,<br> and the dark<br> is all around us.<br> See them...<br> in the corners?<br> You can see the eyes.<br> And they can see ours.<br> I'm a match for anything.<br> Aren't you?<br> I should have been<br> a great fool...<br> not to love you.<br> You'll let me out<br> for easter?<br> Come the resurrection,<br> you can strike me down again.<br> Perhaps next time<br> I'll do it.<br> And perhaps you won't.<br> You know,<br> I hope we never die!<br> So do I.<br> You think there's<br> any chance of it?<br>
