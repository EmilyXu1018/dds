                        - Good morning.<br> - Morning, Mose.<br> Get out from under there!<br> I told you once.<br> How many times I got to tell you?<br> You come back here again...<br> Good morning.<br> Get!<br> Good morning, Harold.<br> Morning, Miss Zan. What does<br> your papa write from Baltimore?<br> - He writes that he feels better.<br> - That's good.<br> Write him my greetings and tell him<br> don't worry about the brass.<br> I'm keeping his name fine and clean.<br> Thanks, I will.<br> Those crabs will make<br> fine eating, Addie.<br> They better. We got high-tone company<br> for dinner tonight.<br> - Bye, Miss Zan.<br> - Good-bye, Harold.<br> Hello. You're out early.<br> - We've been to buy crabs.<br> - We're having gumbo tonight.<br> Gonna give Mr. Marshall of Chicago<br> a real Southern dinner.<br> How's your mama, Mr. David?<br> She's fine, thank you.<br> Zan, she says your petticoats<br> are ready to be fitted.<br> She said you're getting older and I<br> shouldn't say "petticoats" to you...<br> I should say "underskirts,"<br> or else keep still.<br> You shouldn't be saying "petticoats"<br> to me, but you know all about them.<br> Leo says you know almost as much<br> as he does.<br> I wouldn't take your cousin Leo's word<br> for anything. Nobody else does.<br> You don't like Leo, do you?<br> You don't like anybody in my family.<br> Yes, I do.<br> There's one person<br> I'm mighty fond of.<br> - Yes?<br> - Mr. David.<br> It's your papa.<br> Don't laugh at him.<br> He's beneath notice.<br> I'll take you on a picnic Sunday,<br> if you bring your own lunch.<br> Whoa!<br> Good morning, darling.<br> Good morning, Aunt Birdie.<br> Is your headache better?<br> - Yes, it's all gone.<br> - Good morning.<br> I'm going to stop a minute.<br> You drive the horse in.<br> Your mama will be waiting<br> to have breakfast with you, baby.<br> - She ain't nobody to keep waiting.<br> - All right.<br> Guess where we drove this morning.<br> To Lionnet.<br> Darling, was it beautiful?<br> Of course it was.<br> It was always beautiful<br> this time of year.<br> I've learned the Schubert for tonight.<br> I can play everything except the middle.<br> Couldn't we skip the middle?<br> Maybe Mr. Marshall wouldn't notice.<br> We couldn't. I'll come down and play it<br> through for you. You wait now.<br> Your mama says that Mr. Marshall's<br> a very educated, cultured gentleman.<br> I'm sure he'd notice.<br> Now, watch.<br> Two and one,<br> and two and one.<br> - Hey, there!<br> - Ow.<br> Good morning, Uncle Ben.<br> I've been awaken by many things,<br> but never by a concert.<br> Is this the new musical hour?<br> Good morning, Ben. I didn't realize.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Aunt Birdie is showing me how to play<br> a piece for Mr. Marshall tonight.<br> I can't complain then.<br> - Alexandra, your breakfast is ready.<br> - Yes, Mama.<br> All of you, stop that vulgar<br> shouting out of windows.<br> - Morning, Regina.<br> - Really, Ben.<br> You look very silly<br> in your nightgown.<br> - You shouldn't show yourself.<br> - That's why I never got married.<br> I'll dress and come over for breakfast<br> with you and Alexandra.<br> Don't. I hate conversation<br> before I've had something hot.<br> What does your papa say?<br> "I still miss you, Zannie, more than<br> I can say. But you're not to worry.<br> I'm not lonesome, and everybody<br> at the hospital has been very kind. "<br> He addresses the letters to me<br> to make me think I'm grown up...<br> the way he used to<br> when I was little.<br> You don't have to explain to me.<br> Cal, get out that special bottle<br> of old port for this evening.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - The one I've been saving.<br> That Mr. Marshall must be<br> a mighty honored guest.<br> - The grits is cold. Take it back.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> The grits didn't hold their heat!<br> Danver's girl is getting married<br> in Memphis.<br> Is that so?<br> I knew her mother.<br> She stayed with me once at Lionnet.<br> She was a Calhoun,<br> and the Calhouns were kin of ours.<br> Mama said she was too thin<br> for the styles, but I didn't think so.<br> I thought she was very pretty.<br> - Be pleasant to Mr. Marshall at dinner.<br> - Of course, Oscar.<br> No need to say too much.<br> If he should happen to ask<br> about your family...<br> the way people are interested in<br> where other people come from...<br> you might tell him who they were.<br> He'll probably recognize the names.<br> A good name is always useful.<br> Remember that, Leo.<br> Yes, sir?<br> I mean, I heard you, sir.<br> Good names are always useful.<br> - More coffee?<br> - If it's ready, Mama.<br> I've got to get back to the paper<br> in a few minutes.<br> Well, the medium-size bear<br> and the little bear.<br> You don't like the Hubbards much,<br> do you?<br> Mama, you're a high-tone guesser.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I'm walking you to the store.<br> I've been walking there<br> a good many years without your help.<br> Get back to the bank.<br> - Leo?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - Do a good day's work.<br> - Yes, sir. I always do.<br> - Hello, Harold. Howdy, Joe.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Leo.<br> Good morning, Mr. Manders.<br> What can I do for you today?<br> - You can do one thing.<br> - Yes, sir. What's that?<br> Try keeping awake, all day.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Ben.<br> - Good morning to you, Miss Hannah.<br> And here comes the big bear.<br> Now the sun can really shine,<br> the day has begun.<br> Mr. Ben looks mighty pleased<br> this morning.<br> And no wonder. "Our leading citizen,<br> Mr. Benjamin Hubbard...<br> will confer this evening<br> with Mr. William Marshall of Chicago...<br> about the building<br> of a cotton mill here.<br> Mr. Ben will advance many reasons<br> for bringing the mill to our town. "<br> But the real one is our justly<br> renowned average wage...<br> which ranks as the lowest<br> in the country.<br> Are they gonna print that<br> in the paper?<br> Mr. William Marshall, Chicago<br> industrialist and opera patron...<br> is in our midst to take supper<br> with the Hubbards and the Giddens...<br> who will show him what our famous<br> Southern hospitality is like.<br> - That's pretty.<br> - That's the way they'll print it.<br> - Ow!<br> - Hold still, Zan.<br> You had pretty hair<br> when you was little.<br> You was a mighty pretty<br> little girl.<br> Addie, will anybody<br> think I'm pretty now?<br> Someday some fool<br> of a man will, I reckon.<br> Seems there's always somebody<br> for somebody.<br> But you'll do, baby.<br> You're too young to worry<br> about such things, Alexandra.<br> You're going to have all the things<br> I wanted when I was your age.<br> Addie, make the dinner biscuits<br> yourself tonight.<br> Be sure the coffee is strong<br> and the wine is cold.<br> Don't worry, Miss Regina.<br> The dinner will go fine tonight.<br> They used to go to Europe every year,<br> Mr. Marshall.<br> Imagine going all the way to Europe<br> just to listen to music!<br> Once Mama met Mr. Wagner,<br> the composer, you know.<br> Mrs. Wagner gave Mama and Papa<br> a signed program.<br> Another time...<br> No, thank you, Cal.<br> It's remarkable to me<br> how you Southern aristocrats...<br> have kept together,<br> kept what belonged to you.<br> We're not aristocrats. Our brother's<br> wife is the only one who is.<br> You make great distinctions.<br> They've been made for us.<br> Take Birdie's family.<br> They owned the plantation Lionnet.<br> You've probably heard of it.<br> Beautiful place.<br> Best cotton land I ever saw.<br> My mother's grandfather was governor<br> before the war.<br> Those folks had their day,<br> and a great day too.<br> Cloth from Paris,<br> horses you can't raise anymore...<br> - darkies to work for them.<br> - We were good to our people.<br> - Everybody knew that.<br> - But when the war comes...<br> these fine gentlemen ride off and leave<br> the cotton and the women to rot.<br> My father was killed in the war.<br> He was a fine soldier.<br> - A fine man.<br> - Yes, certainly. A famous soldier.<br> That's not the tale<br> I'm telling Mr. Marshall, Birdie.<br> The war ends.<br> Lionnet is almost ruined,<br> and the sons finish ruining it.<br> Why? Because the Southern aristocrat<br> could adapt himself to nothing.<br> Too high-toned to try.<br> - It's difficult to learn new ways.<br> - You're right, it is difficult.<br> But maybe that's why<br> it's profitable.<br> Our grandfather and our father learned<br> the new ways, learned to make them pay.<br> They were in trade. Others, like<br> Birdie's family, looked down on them.<br> To make a long story short,<br> Lionnet now belongs to us.<br> Twenty years ago, we took over their<br> land, their cotton and their daughter.<br> You are boring Mr. Marshall<br> with these ancient family tales.<br> I hope not. I'm just making an important<br> point for our future business partner.<br> - You see...<br> - Will you come and try a very old port?<br> I've been saving it<br> for a special occasion.<br> - Come, Alexandra.<br> - My brother and I feel...<br> a man ain't only in business<br> for himself.<br> - May I?<br> - Thank you. You're most polite.<br> It's got to give him some<br> satisfaction, something here.<br> Money ain't all,<br> not by three shots.<br> Really? I always thought<br> it meant a great deal.<br> So did I, Mr. Marshall.<br> - I've always contended...<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> First you chatter like a magpie,<br> now you're sulking like a schoolgirl.<br> - I'm not doing anything.<br> - You've had too much wine.<br> Get yourself in hand,<br> and stop acting like a fool.<br> You look pretty tonight,<br> Miss Birdie, and young.<br> Me, young?<br> Birdie, Mr. Marshall wants you<br> and Alexandra to play for him.<br> Yes, Regina.<br> I'm coming.<br> You don't have to convince me<br> you're the right people for the deal.<br> You want the mill here, and I do too.<br> It's not my business why you want it.<br> To bring the machine to the cotton,<br> and not the cotton to the machine.<br> - Henry, serve the port.<br> - My reason is more simple.<br> I want to make money,<br> and I believe I can make it on you.<br> However, I have no objection<br> to more high-minded reasons.<br> - Mr. Marshall, I feel...<br> - Birdie, we're ready.<br> Yes, Regina.<br> You know, Mr. Marshall...<br> - Thank you. You both play charmingly.<br> - My wife had the very best teachers.<br> - Those folks had the best of everything.<br> - I must be leaving for my train.<br> Thank you so very much.<br> - I'm sorry you can't stay. Come again.<br> - Thank you.<br> The children will drive you<br> to the depot.<br> Yes, sir. I'll drive you down, sir.<br> Come on, Zan.<br> - Be careful how you drive.<br> - Good-bye, Mrs. Hubbard.<br> - Good-bye, sir.<br> - Fill them up, Oscar.<br> You promised to let me<br> show you Chicago.<br> - Do I have to make you promise again?<br> - I promise again.<br> Wait. Before you leave, sir,<br> here we have a strange custom.<br> We drink the last drink<br> for a toast.<br> That's to prove that the Southerner's<br> always on his feet for the last drink.<br> I give you the firm of Hubbard Sons<br> and Marshall Cotton Mills...<br> and to it a long<br> and prosperous life.<br> Hubbard Sons and Marshall.<br> What y'all want?<br> A little biscuit<br> with a little gravy on it.<br> Somebody write you a golden letter<br> and tell you we got gravy tonight?<br> - We got told.<br> - Mr. David Hewitt tell us.<br> - Say you got high-tone company.<br> - Lots of meat and gravy.<br> Go on, get!<br> Ain't my food to give away.<br> Feed the hungry, the Lord said.<br> Give them some supper, Belle.<br> Miss Regina say supplies going<br> mighty fast around here...<br> and she ain't the stingy kind.<br> A little bit here and there,<br> she don't mind.<br> - But feeding the whole town.<br> - Stop fretting. Tell her I did it.<br> Here. You children keep quiet.<br> Where did the Lord say that<br> about feeding the hungry? What book?<br> I don't know, but if He didn't,<br> He should have. Go ahead.<br> Don't the children<br> make a handsome pair?<br> Leo, you ride here.<br> Let John do the driving.<br> Good-bye and a pleasant journey<br> to you, sir.<br> Giddap.<br> Ben, you did it.<br> Looks like we did.<br> Looks like it?<br> Don't pretend.<br> You look like a cat<br> that's been licking the cream.<br> Let's have a drink<br> to celebrate.<br> I thought the children<br> made a very handsome couple.<br> Yes, you said that before.<br> Yes, it's beginning to look<br> as if the deal's all set.<br> Remember I told him that here<br> we drink the last drink for a toast.<br> - I never heard that before.<br> - Nobody ever heard it before.<br> The Lord forgives those<br> who invent what they need.<br> I already had his signature.<br> But we've all done business with men...<br> whose word over a glass<br> is better than a bond.<br> Anyway, it didn't hurt<br> to have both.<br> - You understand what Ben means?<br> - Yes, I understand.<br> - I understood when it was happening.<br> - Did you, Regina?<br> When he lifted his glass,<br> I saw the bricks going into place.<br> Did you?<br> I saw a lot more than that.<br> I'm gonna leave you and Oscar<br> to count the bricks.<br> - I'm going to Chicago.<br> - Really, Regina?<br> Yes, I'm going to live there.<br> I'm taking Alexandra with me.<br> I'll give big parties for her and see<br> that she meets the best people...<br> and the right young men too.<br> Later on, I'll take trips<br> to New York and Paris...<br> and have everything I want.<br> You shall come to Chicago<br> to visit us.<br> Not too often, of course.<br> Ben, you won't have to learn<br> to be subtle.<br> You'll be very rich, and the rich<br> can be as eccentric as they like.<br> - So you want to live in Chicago?<br> - Yes.<br> Let's all say what we'll want<br> when we're very rich.<br> - What do you want, Oscar?<br> - Might take a few trips, eh, Birdie?<br> - Do you good.<br> - Yes, I'd like that.<br> - Might even go to Jekel Island.<br> - You know what I'd like?<br> I'd like to have Lionnet back.<br> Maybe we could even live there.<br> I do think we could all be happier...<br> - What are you chattering about?<br> - About Lionnet.<br> - Everybody was saying what they'd like.<br> - I can't hear a word you're saying.<br> - I was only saying...<br> - We heard you.<br> I'm waiting for you and Birdie<br> to finish.<br> Four conversations<br> are three too many.<br> First I said I don't know where<br> you'll get the money to live in Chicago.<br> Then I was about to say<br> I thought you heard me say that...<br> and were pretending you didn't.<br> What does that mean?<br> It's like this:<br> For 49 percent,<br> Marshall will put up $400,000.<br> Yes, I know all the terms.<br> Then you also know the contracts<br> will be signed this week...<br> and Marshall will want<br> to see our money soon after.<br> Oscar and I are ready<br> with our two-thirds of the money.<br> But your third, Horace's I mean,<br> doesn't seem to be here.<br> You've written him, Ben's written him,<br> we've all written him. He answers, but...<br> He answers, but there's never a word<br> about whether he's going into this.<br> You're our sister. We want you<br> to benefit from anything we do.<br> And in addition<br> to your concern for me...<br> you do not want control<br> to go out of the family.<br> - That right, Ben?<br> - That's cynical.<br> But cynicism's an unpleasant way<br> of telling the truth.<br> Why doesn't Horace come home<br> and talk business?<br> It's beginning to look like<br> he doesn't want to.<br> Of course he wants to come home.<br> You can't move around with heart trouble<br> at any moment you choose.<br> You know what doctors are like<br> on a case like this.<br> If he wants to, why doesn't he?<br> Doctors or no doctors!<br> Has it ever occurred to you that Horace<br> is also a good businessman?<br> - The bank's proof of that.<br> - Then perhaps he's remaining silent...<br> because he doesn't think<br> he's getting enough for his money.<br> Seventy-five thousand he has to put up.<br> That's a lot of money.<br> Nonsense. That seventy-five thousand<br> will make him a million.<br> That ain't what Regina means.<br> May I interpret you?<br> Regina's saying Horace wants more<br> than a third of our share.<br> He's putting up a third of the money.<br> You put up a third, you get a third.<br> What else could he expect?<br> I don't know about those things.<br> It would seem if you put up a third,<br> you would get a third.<br> And yet again, there's no law<br> about it, is there?<br> I should think if you knew<br> your money was badly needed...<br> you might just say,<br> "I want more.<br> I want a larger share. "<br> You boys have done that.<br> I've heard you say so.<br> So you believe Horace<br> is deliberately holding out?<br> I don't.<br> But I do believe that's what you want.<br> Am I right, Regina?<br> I wouldn't like to persuade Horace<br> unless he gets a larger share.<br> He's my husband.<br> I must look after his interests.<br> Where would this larger share<br> be coming from?<br> I don't know about things like this.<br> Maybe it could come<br> off your share, Oscar.<br> What kind of talk is this?<br> I haven't said a thing.<br> You're talking big tonight.<br> Am I?<br> You should know me<br> well enough by now...<br> to know I don't ask for things<br> I don't think I can get.<br> I don't believe you can get the money<br> or get Horace to come home.<br> I can get him home.<br> How can you get him home?<br> I will send Alexandra<br> to Baltimore.<br> She will tell her father that<br> she wants him to come home...<br> that I miss him very much<br> and that I want him to come home.<br> You know Horace.<br> He'll come home.<br> I admire you, Regina.<br> But before he comes,<br> what's he going to get?<br> How much do you want?<br> Twice what you offered.<br> - You won't get it.<br> - You've gone crazy.<br> - I don't want to fight.<br> - I don't either, Regina.<br> You're holding us up.<br> Now, that's not pretty.<br> But we need you,<br> and I'm a peaceful man.<br> Here's what I'll do:<br> I'll give Horace 40 percent...<br> instead of the thirty-three and a third<br> he really should get...<br> provided he's home and his money is up<br> within two weeks.<br> - How's that?<br> - All right.<br> I've asked before:<br> Where is this extra share coming from?<br> - From your share.<br> - So that's my reward.<br> For 30 years I've worked for you,<br> done the things you didn't want to do.<br> My, I'm being attacked<br> on all sides tonight.<br> I can't believe the Lord means for<br> the strong to parade their strength...<br> but I don't mind doing it<br> if it's got to be done.<br> Oscar, you'll be a very rich man.<br> What does it matter if a little more<br> goes here, a little less goes there?<br> - It's all in the family.<br> - That's right.<br> I'll never marry, so my money<br> will go to Alexandra and Leo.<br> They might even marry someday.<br> That would make a great difference<br> in my feelings if they married.<br> - That's what I mean.<br> - Is that what you mean, Regina?<br> It's all too far away.<br> Addie, clean up.<br> - We'll talk about it in a few years.<br> - I want to talk about it now!<br> - But Zan is so young.<br> - There are many things to consider.<br> - They are first cousins.<br> - That isn't unusual.<br> Grandmother and Grandfather<br> were first cousins.<br> Yes, and look at us.<br> You're both being very gay<br> with my money.<br> Regina, Oscar is giving up<br> something for you.<br> You ought to try<br> and manage something for him.<br> - But Leo is a very wild boy.<br> - Yes, but...<br> please assure Oscar that you<br> will think about it seriously.<br> Very well. I assure you<br> I will think about it seriously.<br> - What kind of an answer is that?<br> - My, you're in a bad humor.<br> Now leave me alone.<br> Weren't those fine clothes<br> Mr. Marshall had?<br> Looks like maybe they were done<br> in England.<br> You should have come with us,<br> Aunt Birdie. It's a lovely night.<br> - Were you gracious to Mr. Marshall?<br> - I think so, Mama.<br> Good.<br> Now I have news for you.<br> You're going to Baltimore in the morning<br> to bring your father home.<br> Oh, Mama!<br> Addie, Papa's coming back.<br> We're going to bring him home.<br> You're going alone, Alexandra.<br> Going alone?<br> A child that age?<br> Mr. Horace ain't gonna like<br> Miss Zan traipsing...<br> Go upstairs and lay out<br> Miss Alexandra's things.<br> I'll attend<br> to your railroad ticket.<br> He'd expect me to be along.<br> I'll be up in a minute<br> to tell you what to pack!<br> Good night.<br> Have a nice trip.<br> - I could go with her.<br> - No, Birdie.<br> She's old enough<br> to assume some responsibility.<br> Better learn now.<br> Almost old enough to get married.<br> - Eh, son?<br> - Huh?<br> Old enough to get married,<br> you're thinking, huh?<br> Yes, sir. Lots of girls<br> get married at Zan's age.<br> Look at Mary Prester and Johanna.<br> Alexandra is not getting married<br> tomorrow...<br> but she is going to Baltimore.<br> So let's talk about that.<br> I should think you'd like to go. At your<br> age, I would have been delighted.<br> Addie has babied you too much.<br> I wanted to go before, Mama...<br> but you said you couldn't go<br> and that I couldn't go alone.<br> I've changed my mind. I must help Addie<br> get your things together.<br> Why don't you all go home?<br> Good night.<br> - Don't be long, Zan.<br> - Come along.<br> Imagine not wanting to go.<br> Wish it was me.<br> What I could do in a place<br> like Baltimore.<br> I can guess the kind of things<br> you could do.<br> No, you couldn't.<br> Oscar, don't be so glum.<br> You're getting to look as if<br> your shoes were always pinching.<br> - I must...<br> - I can take care of myself.<br> That's not what I'm worried about.<br> It's about Leo.<br> He's my own son, but you're more to me<br> than my own child.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - You're not going to marry Leo.<br> - Marry Leo?<br> - I couldn't stand to think of it.<br> Don't you understand?<br> They'll make you.<br> That's foolish.<br> I'm grown up.<br> Nobody can make me do anything.<br> I'm waiting for you.<br> Good night, Aunt Birdie.<br> Good night, Uncle Oscar.<br> What happened, Aunt Birdie?<br> Nothing, darling.<br> Nothing happened.<br> You go to bed.<br> I only twisted my ankle.<br> I'm coming, Mama.<br> And don't forget<br> about brushing your hair:<br> Fifty strokes in the morning,<br> a hundred at night.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - And don't use no store soap.<br> - Just use the soap I made you.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Don't "uh-huh" me.<br> Are you listening?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good morning.<br> That Hannah Francis is sure<br> an ugly little girl, just like her ma.<br> There's smelling salts and perfumed<br> water in the little satchel.<br> Keep your gloves on so your hands<br> don't get dirty.<br> And don't talk to nobody on the train,<br> and don't get off more than you have to.<br> Just sit still like a lady.<br> Stop at Mrs. Hewitt's a minute.<br> I want to ask about my new dress.<br> - We ain't got no time to be stopping.<br> - Got plenty of time.<br> David!<br> Good morning.<br> Where are you going?<br> To Baltimore all by myself<br> to bring Papa home.<br> - I'll be gone a whole week maybe.<br> - Good for you.<br> Is that all you can say?<br> What do you want me to say?<br> At least say you're sorry<br> you can't go to the depot with me.<br> - Just getting up at 11:00.<br> - Morning, Zan.<br> He's just going to bed.<br> He's been writing all night.<br> Writing things<br> to put in the newspaper?<br> He says he's writing things<br> they won't put...<br> in the newspaper.<br> - I'm coming to the depot to see you off.<br> - No, you ain't dressed.<br> - That's right.<br> - Cal, get this carriage going.<br> Get out of here! Get going!<br> Hurry up!<br> Shoo!<br> Don't you just keep sitting there.<br> Get off at stations.<br> Take a walk around. Talk to people.<br> - I told her not to talk to nobody.<br> - You'll talk to people.<br> Go to the coaches. Talk to everybody.<br> It'll do you good.<br> - 'Board!<br> - Bye, Addie.<br> - Bye. Take good care of yourself.<br> - You, sir.<br> - Bring your papa home safe and sound.<br> - Would you mind sitting in this seat?<br> - Take good care of yourself.<br> - Sit here, please. Right here.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, talk to him.<br> He looks nice. Find out what<br> he thinks, where he comes from.<br> - Find out everything you can.<br> - 'Board!<br> - I just found out one thing.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - I'm going to miss you, David.<br> - What?<br> I said I'm going to miss you.<br> - What?<br> - I said I... Nothing!<br> Hello.<br> In there. In the room<br> next to Miss Regina's.<br> - All right.<br> - And hurry up!<br> Walk it slow, Ezra.<br> - Where will I put these books?<br> - Put them on that table.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> - Put that by the fireplace.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Mr. Horace sure gonna like<br> being moved back in his old room.<br> That's all.<br> Get back to work.<br> - Bring me Mr. Horace's green lamp.<br> - Yes.<br> There's the carriage!<br> - They're here!<br> - Don't get so excited.<br> Go and help with the bags.<br> - They ain't on the train.<br> - What?<br> My goodness!<br> - They ain't on the train!<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Cal, what happened?<br> - They ain't on the train.<br> - They must have been.<br> - They wasn't. I looked and I looked.<br> I even asked Mr. Jonsie. He say<br> they didn't get on at Mobile at all.<br> - What you think happened?<br> - How should I know? Probably nothing.<br> Don't ask me questions<br> the rest of the night!<br> Go get that green lamp.<br> Go on.<br> - Evening, Regina.<br> - Good evening, Ben.<br> You dropping in for supper?<br> They didn't come on the 6:00.<br> There's no other train tonight.<br> - What do you think happened?<br> - They probably stopped off somewhere.<br> They'll be along.<br> Put that on Mr. Horace's desk.<br> So you're moving Horace<br> back to his old room.<br> - You're a smart woman.<br> - Where would they stop off?<br> Horace has got that cousin<br> in Savannah he's so fond of.<br> Maybe they stopped off to see him.<br> I don't know where they stopped off.<br> How do you know they even started<br> from Baltimore?<br> Of course they started.<br> I have a letter from Alexandra.<br> What is so strange about people<br> arriving late? Don't worry so much.<br> I'm a natural worrier...<br> especially when I'm ready<br> to close a business deal...<br> and one of my partners<br> remains silent and invisible.<br> They'll be along tomorrow.<br> You boys might as well go home now.<br> Good night.<br> That cousin of Horace's<br> has been dead for years.<br> And anyway, the train<br> doesn't go through Savannah.<br> Did he die? Ben, you're always<br> remembering about people dying.<br> - It's so bad for your health.<br> - Good night.<br> My father's tired. We must stay<br> overnight so he can rest.<br> - He'll need a room on this floor.<br> - All the rooms on this floor are taken.<br> Then you'll have to move somebody<br> it won't hurt to climb stairs.<br> You'll have to do it right away.<br> My father must have rest and quiet.<br> Come help my father<br> out of the carriage, please.<br> My, she's turning out to be<br> her mother's daughter.<br> You'd better move<br> that Mr. Clark from 105.<br> Put him on the third floor.<br> Mr. Dawson, where's the Tom Bixby<br> Commission meeting tonight?<br> Room A, 9:00.<br> Think they'll let you in?<br> I think so.<br> - Be sure that his soup is very hot.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> And for dessert<br> he can have fresh fruit...<br> - but it's got to be perfectly fresh.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> I think that's all he'll want.<br> I'll want a lot.<br> I'm very hungry.<br> - I think I'll have the whole dinner.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - And...<br> - And mocha cake.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hello. How are you?<br> How's your father?<br> Come here a minute.<br> This is Miss Julia Jordan.<br> Miss Alexandra Giddens.<br> I'm mighty glad to meet you.<br> Forgive Miss Giddens.<br> It's not entirely her fault.<br> She comes<br> from a bad-mannered family.<br> Did you order dinner?<br> Yes, Papa.<br> It will be right along.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - Much better, dear.<br> What's the matter?<br> Nothing, Papa.<br> You remember David Hewitt?<br> Of course I remember him.<br> How is he?<br> He's changed.<br> After all his working up north<br> and wandering around the country...<br> coming back and talking<br> about people's rights...<br> and how everybody<br> ought to be decent.<br> Now for all his fine talk,<br> he's out there in the dining room...<br> with one of those girls.<br> One of what girls?<br> She's got powder on her nose.<br> And he's with her.<br> And does it concern you?<br> Of course it doesn't.<br> - You can just bet it doesn't.<br> - Then why not forget about him?<br> I did go for some walks with him<br> and three picnics.<br> Really three and a half.<br> Halftime it rained and...<br> I tried to understand<br> the fine things he was talking about.<br> Then he dared<br> to introduce her to me!<br> Did he?<br> I didn't say a word to her.<br> I just looked.<br> Then I walked away.<br> Did you?<br> That was very virtuous of you.<br> Wasn't that right, Papa?<br> Who's been teaching you<br> to hurt the feelings of other people?<br> I didn't think about it that way.<br> What should I do, Papa?<br> You'll have to decide for yourself.<br> So I want to ask your pardon. I don't<br> ever want to hurt anybody's feelings.<br> If you'll be gracious enough to forgive<br> my rudeness and shake my hand...<br> Then you'll show me that your manners<br> are far better than mine could ever be.<br> Thank you.<br> That's real friendly of you.<br> I thank you too. Come on.<br> I'll take you back to your father.<br> Excuse me, Julia.<br> You look tired.<br> Was it a hard trip?<br> You going back<br> on the early morning train?<br> I'll be on it.<br> Maybe I can help.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - May I come in and pay my respects?<br> - Papa must rest tonight.<br> That was a mighty sweet thing<br> you did just now.<br> I still don't approve<br> of your conduct.<br> Very well.<br> I'll make a note of it.<br> Go back and tell your friend<br> to wash her face.<br> - Morning, Papa.<br> - You just getting up?<br> - What kind of working hours you keeping?<br> - My, you're nervous this morning.<br> Nervous about Uncle Horace<br> not coming home, I guess.<br> I've told you before, you've got<br> to start working harder at the bank.<br> Got to convince Uncle Horace<br> you'll make a fit husband for Alexandra.<br> Yes, sir. You think Uncle Horace<br> don't want to go in on this?<br> That's my hunch.<br> Ain't showing signs<br> of loving it yet.<br> But he hasn't listened<br> to Aunt Regina yet either.<br> He'll go along.<br> It's too good a thing.<br> He's got plenty<br> and plenty to invest with.<br> He don't even have<br> to sell anything.<br> Ninety thousand worth<br> of Union Pacific bonds...<br> sitting right<br> in his safe-deposit box.<br> All he's got to do<br> is open the box.<br> Yeah. He's had those bonds<br> for 15 years.<br> Bought them when they were low<br> and just locked them up.<br> Yeah, he just has to open the box<br> and take them out. That's all.<br> Easy as easy can be.<br> The things in that box.<br> There's all those bonds<br> looking mighty fine.<br> Then right next to them<br> is a baby shoe of Zan's...<br> and a cheap old cameo<br> on a string.<br> And nobody would believe this:<br> A piece of an old violin.<br> Not even a whole violin,<br> just a piece of an old thing.<br> A piece of a violin.<br> - What do you think of that?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And a lot of other crazy things too.<br> A poem I guess it is,<br> signed with his mother's name.<br> How do you know<br> what's in the box, son?<br> It was one of the boys<br> at the bank.<br> He took old Manders' keys.<br> It was Joe Horn.<br> He just took old Manders' keys<br> and took the box out.<br> Then they asked me if I wanted<br> to see too, so I looked a little.<br> But I made them close the box,<br> and I told them...<br> Joe Horn, you say?<br> He opened it?<br> Yes, sir, he did.<br> My word of honor.<br> That don't excuse me for looking,<br> but I did make him close it...<br> and put the keys back<br> in Manders' drawer.<br> Tell me the truth.<br> I'm not gonna be angry with you.<br> - Did you open the box yourself?<br> - No, sir, I didn't.<br> Sometimes a young fellow deserves credit<br> for looking around him...<br> see what's going on.<br> Many great men have made their fortune<br> with their eyes.<br> Did you open the box?<br> It may have been a good thing<br> if you had.<br> Did you?<br> I opened it.<br> Does anybody else<br> know you opened it?<br> Don't be afraid<br> of speaking the truth.<br> - Nobody was in the bank when I did it.<br> - Will Horace know you opened it?<br> He only looks in it once<br> every six months when he cuts a coupon.<br> Sometimes Manders<br> even does that for him.<br> Uncle Horace don't even have the keys.<br> Manders keeps them for him.<br> Imagine not looking at all that.<br> You can bet if I had those bonds,<br> I'd watch them like...<br> If you had them, you could have a share<br> in the mill. You and me.<br> A fine big share too.<br> A man can't be shot for wanting<br> to see his son get on in the world.<br> - Can he, boy?<br> - No, he can't.<br> But I haven't got the bonds<br> and Uncle Horace has.<br> You think your Uncle Horace<br> likes you well enough...<br> to lend you the bonds if he decides<br> not to use them himself?<br> Papa, it must be you gone crazy.<br> Lend me the bonds?<br> No, I suppose not.<br> Just a fancy of mine.<br> A loan for three months,<br> maybe four.<br> Easy enough for us<br> to pay it back then.<br> Anyway, this is only April.<br> If he doesn't look at the bonds<br> till fall...<br> he wouldn't even miss them<br> out of the box.<br> That's it.<br> He wouldn't even miss them.<br> How could he miss them<br> if he never looks at them?<br> You laugh when I say<br> he could lend you the bonds...<br> if he's not gonna use them.<br> But would it hurt him?<br> It wouldn't hurt him.<br> People ought<br> to help other people.<br> So she got him home at last.<br> Careful, Addie.<br> - They're here.<br> - Yes, Belle.<br> - Tidy up the room.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> And me sitting up all night<br> worrying about you.<br> We don't want to hear<br> how worried you've been.<br> We had to stay in Mobile overnight<br> for Papa to rest.<br> - Upstairs?<br> - No, I'll wait, David.<br> I'll rest here<br> for a minute.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you for coming with us.<br> I like talking to you.<br> - In fact, I like you. I always have.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Do you like me?<br> - Not today.<br> I'll come back tomorrow.<br> Good-bye, sir.<br> Good-bye, David.<br> Remember me to your mother.<br> I will.<br> Good-bye, funny.<br> I bet Mama's been worried.<br> - I better tell her we're back.<br> - Not for a minute.<br> You feel bad again.<br> I knew you did.<br> - Do you want your medicine?<br> - I don't feel that way.<br> I just wanted to rest a little.<br> - Them fancy doctors do you any good?<br> - They did their best.<br> This is Father's<br> very special medicine.<br> We'll keep one bottle down here<br> and one in his room.<br> He must have the pills<br> every four hours.<br> And the special medicine,<br> only if he feels very bad. Careful.<br> Since when I ain't old enough<br> to hold a bottle of medicine?<br> You feel all right?<br> He says he does, but he doesn't.<br> The trip was very hard on him.<br> He's got to go right to bed.<br> Help me.<br> No, I don't need<br> that much help.<br> Addie, is your coffee as good<br> as it used to be?<br> Dr. Boden said not much coffee.<br> Just now and then.<br> Do you hear me?<br> I'm the nurse now.<br> You'd be a better one<br> if you didn't look so dirty.<br> Take a bath, change your linens, get on<br> a fresh dress and brush your hair good.<br> Will you be all right?<br> I'll look after Mr. Horace.<br> Ring for Belle and have her help you.<br> - Hurry.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> My old room.<br> I haven't slept here since...<br> Since a mighty long time.<br> Before I see anybody else...<br> Thank you, Addie.<br> - I want to know why Zan came for me.<br> - I don't know.<br> All I know is<br> big things is going on.<br> Everybody gonna be high-tone rich.<br> You too.<br> All 'cause smoke gonna start<br> from a building that ain't even up yet.<br> I've heard about that.<br> And Miss Zannie, she's gonna marry<br> Mr. Leo in a little while.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - That's right. That's the talk.<br> - What's the talk?<br> - There's gonna be a wedding.<br> Over my dead body there is.<br> Horace, you finally arrived.<br> All right, Addie.<br> I'm very happy to see you.<br> - How are you?<br> - What happened to you and Alexandra?<br> We stopped overnight in Mobile.<br> I didn't feel good.<br> - Just a little weak, I suppose.<br> - Here we are.<br> Been a long time.<br> You know how much I wanted to come<br> to the hospital and be with you.<br> But I didn't know where my duty lay:<br> Here or with you.<br> But you know<br> how much I wanted to come.<br> That's kind of you. There was no need<br> to come. I didn't have a bad time.<br> Maybe at first when the doctors told me,<br> but after I got used to the idea...<br> I sort of liked it there.<br> You're looking very well,<br> very handsome.<br> You liked it there.<br> Isn't it strange you liked it so well<br> you didn't want to come home?<br> That's not the way to put it.<br> But I did like lying there<br> and thinking.<br> I never had much time to think.<br> Time's become valuable to me.<br> - It sounds almost like a holiday.<br> - It was, sort of.<br> - I was thinking you were in pain.<br> - I was in pain.<br> Instead you were having<br> a holiday of thinking.<br> - I was thinking about us.<br> - About us?<br> About you and me<br> after all these years?<br> You shall tell me everything<br> you thought, someday.<br> What's this crazy talk<br> about Zan and Leo marrying?<br> Who gossips so much around here?<br> It's some foolishness Oscar thought up.<br> I'll explain later.<br> It was simply a way<br> of keeping him quiet...<br> in all this business<br> I've been writing you about.<br> I have no intention<br> of allowing any such arrangement.<br> Neither have I, so put it out<br> of Oscar's head immediately.<br> - You know what I think of Leo.<br> - There's no need to talk about it now.<br> There's no need to talk about it ever.<br> Not as long as I live.<br> I suppose they've written you.<br> I can't live very long.<br> I have never understood why people<br> have to talk about this kind of thing!<br> You must understand. I don't intend<br> to gossip about my sickness.<br> I thought it was only fair<br> to tell you.<br> I was not asking for your sympathy.<br> Let's try to get along<br> a little better than we usually do.<br> Yes. It's foolish<br> for us to fight this way.<br> I didn't mean to be unpleasant.<br> It was very stupid of me.<br> I didn't either. I came home<br> wanting so much not to fight.<br> Yes, let's try to get along better.<br> I want to very much.<br> Can we pay our respects?<br> Yes, you can pay your respects,<br> as you say.<br> So the fugitives<br> have arrived at last.<br> Welcome home, Horace.<br> You had us all mighty worried.<br> - Hello, Ben, Oscar.<br> - It sure is good to see you.<br> - You're looking tip-top. Yes, sir.<br> - Am I?<br> Everybody in town's<br> been asking for you.<br> But then you only know how folks<br> really feel through an absence.<br> - Ain't that true?<br> - I hope so.<br> Horace! I just found out<br> you were back.<br> You don't look well.<br> No, you don't.<br> - What a thing to say.<br> - Oscar thinks I look tip-top.<br> What is that costume you have on?<br> Now that you're home, you'll feel<br> better. We'll take fine care of you.<br> I asked what is that strange costume<br> you're parading around in?<br> Me? Oh, it's my wrapper.<br> I was so excited about Horace...<br> Did you come across the street<br> dressed that way? My dear Birdie!<br> Just like old times.<br> - No fights. This is a holiday.<br> - I'll go right home.<br> You'll be running back<br> across the square like that.<br> I'm sorry, Oscar.<br> We've been having<br> some mighty fine weather.<br> Yes, sir. You'll enjoy<br> the good sunshine and fresh air...<br> I don't like to worry you<br> when you're tired...<br> but Ben has some very important<br> business to talk over with you.<br> - Tomorrow.<br> - I'd like to now.<br> It's very important to me,<br> very important to all of us.<br> Important to your beloved daughter.<br> She'll be a very great heiress.<br> - Will she? That's nice.<br> - Please.<br> You said we'll try<br> to get along better.<br> I'll try, I really will,<br> only please do this for me now.<br> You'll see what I've done for you<br> while you've been away.<br> Ben, tell Horace all about it,<br> only be quick because he's very tired...<br> and he must go to bed.<br> See how I've watched<br> your interests.<br> I think that your news<br> will be better for him...<br> than all the doctors<br> and medicine in the world.<br> I hope so,<br> but my news can wait.<br> Horace may not feel<br> like talking today.<br> What an old faker you are.<br> You know it can't wait.<br> You know the deal<br> must be closed this week.<br> You've been as anxious for him<br> to come home as I've been.<br> I suppose I have been.<br> And why not?<br> Horace has done Hubbard Sons<br> many a good turn.<br> Why shouldn't I be anxious<br> to help him now?<br> Help him when you need him.<br> That's what you mean.<br> What a woman you married, Horace.<br> Then I'll make it quick.<br> For 30 years I've cried...<br> "Bring the cotton mills<br> to the cotton. "<br> I'm here to tell you<br> they're on their way.<br> - Get...<br> - Can I get you something?<br> Water.<br> I'm sorry. I will.<br> You must excuse me now.<br> I'm feeling the trip.<br> - Would you ask Cal to come help me?<br> - Yes.<br> But the deal is coming to a close,<br> and Ben must move quickly.<br> - I understand.<br> - If you could listen a few minutes...<br> then I'll take care<br> of everything for you.<br> - Not today. Some other time.<br> - This is important to all of us.<br> Can't you see we've been waiting<br> for months for you to come home and...<br> I can see that you did<br> want me to come home.<br> We'll just run along home now.<br> We can talk about this tomorrow.<br> Come along, Oscar.<br> I didn't mean<br> that was the reason why...<br> I think you did mean it,<br> and that makes me very sad.<br> You think maybe he don't want<br> to go in with us?<br> It was a mistake<br> to talk to him today.<br> He's a sick man,<br> but he ain't a crazy one.<br> Suppose he is crazy.<br> What then?<br> Then we'll go outside<br> for the money.<br> - There's plenty who'll give it.<br> - They'll want a lot for what they give.<br> Ones that are rich enough to give<br> will be smart enough to want.<br> That means<br> we'd be working for them.<br> You don't have to tell me<br> the things I told you six months ago.<br> Regina, you're a fool.<br> Mama told you it's unwise<br> for a good-looking woman to frown.<br> I told you softness and a smile<br> will do more to the hearts of men.<br> I'll do things in my own way.<br> I know what I'm doing.<br> I hope you do.<br> There is nothing to worry about.<br> Come along, Oscar.<br> Oh, Lord<br> Sound the trump of thejudgment<br> Hallelujah<br> White people<br> may have the pianos...<br> but the colored folks<br> have got the voices.<br> - Weary arms are totin'ol'cotton<br> - Give me a push.<br> - Good night. We had a lovely evening.<br> - Thank you.<br> - We had such a good time.<br> - Good night, Sally.<br> - It's good to see Horace again.<br> - I'm sorry he had to go up so early.<br> He has to be careful<br> till he gets his strength back.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> - Tell Horace I'll see him tomorrow.<br> - Yes, I will. Good night.<br> I'll be along in a minute.<br> Leo, take your mama home.<br> - Can't I wait for you and Uncle Ben?<br> - No, run along.<br> - I'll be back.<br> - Never mind. Go on.<br> Come along, Mama.<br> Good night, Aunt Regina.<br> Didn't you two notice<br> that the party is over?<br> - We got a little talking to do.<br> - Not much, just a simple question.<br> - Have you got any news for us?<br> - Not yet, but I've talked to Horace.<br> I imagined you had, Regina.<br> I didn't want to hurry him too much.<br> You saw what happened that first day.<br> There's got<br> to be a little hurrying done.<br> I had a rather urgent letter<br> from Marshall this morning.<br> This thing's got to be closed<br> the end of the week.<br> That means Oscar's got to leave<br> for Chicago tomorrow.<br> It turns out we're in more of a hurry<br> than you thought we were.<br> We got to know tonight whether you<br> and Horace are coming in with us.<br> That was the time<br> I was working in the...<br> - It's time you were coming in.<br> - Not yet, Mama.<br> I'm talking to David.<br> When you've finished your talking,<br> come straight to bed.<br> Yes, Mama.<br> - Good night, David.<br> - Good night, Mrs. Giddens.<br> That's the first time I ever heard<br> your mother tell you to do something...<br> and you didn't hop to do it.<br> That's a funny thing to say.<br> You know, you take one step<br> and then you take another.<br> After a while, you find out<br> you're walking all by yourself.<br> You don't understand<br> what I'm talking about, do you?<br> An awful lot of things<br> I don't understand lately.<br> Things that are happening here.<br> I could explain them to you,<br> but you wouldn't like me if I did.<br> You've got to find them out<br> for yourself.<br> You'll know tonight.<br> Let's walk around the square.<br> Come on.<br> This cannot wait any longer.<br> Talk to us about it now.<br> - I've been patient for days.<br> - And persistent.<br> All right.<br> I understand we're getting<br> a larger share. Why?<br> Because I did<br> a little bargaining for you.<br> Convinced my brothers they weren't<br> the only Hubbards with business sense.<br> Did you have to convince them of that?<br> How little people know about each other.<br> You'll know better<br> about Regina next time, Ben.<br> Yes.<br> - Who's getting less?<br> - Oscar.<br> Oscar's gotten unselfish.<br> What's happened to you?<br> I'll get mine in the end.<br> He's got his son's future<br> to think about.<br> Leo.<br> Everybody will get theirs.<br> I'm beginning to understand.<br> I knew you would as soon<br> as you had time to think it over.<br> Yes, sir, Horace,<br> this 75,000 will get you a million.<br> Yes, Horace, it will!<br> What did you have to promise Marshall<br> besides your money?<br> Water power,<br> free and plenty of it.<br> - You have that?<br> - Easy.<br> You'd think the governor of a great<br> state would make his price higher...<br> just out of pride.<br> And cheap labor.<br> "The wages has got to be cheaper<br> than Massachusetts," Marshall says.<br> And that averages eight a week.<br> You bought the water from the governor.<br> It was his to sell?<br> Go on, Ben.<br> "Eight a week?" I say to Marshall.<br> "I'd work for eight a week myself. "<br> There ain't a man in this section,<br> black or white...<br> who wouldn't give his right arm<br> for three silver dollars every week.<br> They'll take less than that when<br> you play them off against each other.<br> Your father said<br> he made the thousands...<br> - and you boys would make the millions.<br> - Millions for us too.<br> Us? You and me?<br> I don't think so.<br> You've got enough money, Regina.<br> We'll just sit by<br> and watch the boys grow rich.<br> Then this means<br> you're finally turning us down?<br> Is it possible<br> that's what you mean?<br> I don't want any part of it.<br> I've been trying to tell you that.<br> - I want to know your reasons.<br> - I don't know myself. Leave it at that.<br> We shall not leave it at that.<br> I want to know your reasons now.<br> - We've been waiting like children...<br> - Yes, to nag at me to invest my money.<br> If you're disappointed, I'm sorry.<br> But I must do what I think best.<br> Now, good night.<br> Please wait downstairs.<br> - Oscar and I will go home now.<br> - Please wait downstairs!<br> There will be<br> no more talking about this.<br> I'm sick and tired of hearing about it.<br> I've given my answer, and that is all.<br> I think we'll have to talk<br> about it, Horace.<br> Just you and me.<br> I never did believe<br> he was going in with us.<br> I thought he'd go in.<br> What do you expect me to do?<br> Nothing.<br> You done your almighty best.<br> There's nothing you can do.<br> Maybe there's something<br> I could do for us.<br> Or, I might better say,<br> Leo could do for us.<br> - Ain't that true, son?<br> - What do you mean?<br> Leo's got a friend.<br> Leo's friend owns $90,000 worth<br> of Union Pacific bonds.<br> Leo's friend don't look<br> at the bonds much...<br> not for five or six months<br> at a time.<br> Union Pacific.<br> Let me understand this.<br> Leo's friend would lend him<br> the bonds, and he would...<br> Would be kind enough<br> to lend them to us.<br> - Leo.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - When would your friend want them back?<br> - I don't know.<br> You told me he won't look<br> at them till fall.<br> That's right, but I...<br> Not till fall.<br> - But Uncle Horace...<br> - Be still.<br> Your uncle doesn't wish<br> to know your friend's name.<br> That's a good one.<br> Not know his name?<br> Shut up, Leo.<br> He won't look at them till September.<br> That gives us five months.<br> Leo will return the bonds<br> in three months.<br> We'll have no trouble raising the money<br> once the mills start going up.<br> Will Marshall accept bonds?<br> Why not?<br> We're lucky, Oscar.<br> We'll take the loan<br> from Leo's friend.<br> I think he'll make a safer partner<br> than our sister.<br> How soon do you think<br> you can borrow them?<br> Right away, tonight.<br> They're in the safe-deposit box...<br> I don't want to know<br> where they are.<br> We'll keep it secret from you, Ben.<br> Good night, Oscar.<br> - Good luck to us.<br> - Leo will be taken care of?<br> I'm entitled<br> to Uncle Horace's share.<br> Gee, that would make me a partner.<br> "Partner"?<br> Why, you...<br> He didn't mean it. I want to be sure<br> he'll get something out of this.<br> We'll take care of him.<br> We'll arrange that later.<br> Then that's settled.<br> Come on, son.<br> I didn't mean just that.<br> I was only gonna say...<br> Go on. You have work to do.<br> Good night, David.<br> - Good night, Zannie.<br> - Good night, David.<br> Hello, Zannie.<br> - Won't you leave me alone?<br> - I won't let you alone!<br> - If I'd let you alone, you'd still be...<br> - Uncle Ben, make Mama stop.<br> She can't do that to Papa.<br> It isn't right.<br> - Alexandra, you have a tender heart.<br> - If you won't do anything about it...<br> I will!<br> Now, you see? It's all over.<br> Don't worry so, my dear.<br> Married folks frequently<br> raise their voices, unfortunately.<br> How can you treat Papa like this?<br> He's very sick. Don't you know that?<br> - Mind your business.<br> - This is my business.<br> - It's my business to stop what's wrong.<br> - Don't you dare speak to me like this!<br> - Go to bed!<br> - Yes, Mama.<br> You'll have to put Marshall off<br> for a few days.<br> I'm afraid I can't do that for you.<br> I told you his letter was urgent.<br> How much more time can you give me?<br> - Horace has refused.<br> - He'll change his mind.<br> I'll find a way to make him.<br> How much longer can you wait?<br> I could wait a few days,<br> but I can't wait a few days.<br> I could, but I can't.<br> Could and can't.<br> I have to go now.<br> I'm very late.<br> You're not going.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> I forgot to tell you. Oscar's going<br> to Chicago tomorrow as we planned...<br> so we can't be here<br> for our usual Friday night supper.<br> Oscar's...<br> What do you mean?<br> Just that. He's going to deliver<br> the money to Marshall.<br> You're lying.<br> You're trying to scare me.<br> You haven't got the money.<br> How can you have it?<br> How can he go to Chicago?<br> Did a ghost arrive with the money?<br> I don't believe you.<br> - Come back here. I want to talk to you.<br> - You're getting out of hand.<br> Since when do I take orders<br> from you?<br> Come back!<br> Good night.<br> It's a great day<br> when you and Ben cross swords.<br> I've been waiting for it for years.<br> So they found out they don't need you.<br> So you'll not have<br> your millions after all.<br> You hate to see anybody live now,<br> don't you?<br> You hate to think I'll be alive<br> and have what I want.<br> - You'd think that was my reason.<br> - Yes.<br> Because you're going to die<br> and you know you're going to die.<br> Maybe it's easier<br> for the dying to be honest.<br> I'm sick of you! Sick of this house,<br> sick of my unhappy life with you.<br> I'm sick of your brothers<br> and their dirty tricks to make a dime!<br> There must be better ways of getting<br> rich than building sweatshops...<br> and pounding the bones of the town<br> to make dividends for you to spend.<br> You'll wreck the town,<br> you and your brothers.<br> You'll wreck the country,<br> you and your kind, if they let you.<br> But not me.<br> I'll die my own way.<br> I'll do it without making the world<br> any worse. I'll leave that to you.<br> I hope you die.<br> I hope you die soon.<br> - Mama, don't!<br> - I'll be waiting for you to die.<br> Don't!<br> Papa, don't listen.<br> Please just don't listen!<br> Go away.<br> Thank you, Birdie.<br> That was nice.<br> I hope I didn't disturb Regina.<br> I should have thought to ask.<br> Miss Regina ain't home.<br> I'd have told you.<br> She's at Mrs. Hewitt's<br> getting a dress fitted.<br> Thank you, Addie.<br> Horace, look.<br> Simon brought me these from Lionnet.<br> Oscar was out there shooting<br> this morning.<br> Simon says they're just<br> growing wild there now.<br> Coming, Addie.<br> Why don't you pick some?<br> I don't like crab apples.<br> You're getting too old<br> to be climbing trees.<br> - Why?<br> - Your petticoats are showing.<br> - David Hewitt.<br> - Or should I say "underskirts. "<br> - You certainly should.<br> - Under any name, they're still showing.<br> If you'd lift me down instead of<br> sitting there, you wouldn't see them.<br> Hello.<br> You might at least help me<br> pick some up.<br> Somebody must be gonna make<br> some mighty fine jelly.<br> That's right, Simon.<br> I'll bet Simon was sorry to see<br> your Uncle Oscar come back from Chicago.<br> Oscar hasn't been over to our house<br> since he got back.<br> He or Uncle Ben.<br> Not since that night.<br> I don't like to think about it.<br> I try not to all the time.<br> - You never like to think about things.<br> - There you go again.<br> Always want somebody else<br> to do your thinking for you.<br> I'm tired of having you say that!<br> It just isn't true.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> I think I want you<br> to go away from here.<br> "Go away"?<br> Are you crazy?<br> What would I do?<br> Where would I go?<br> I think you're just trying<br> not to see me anymore.<br> - You do?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> But you don't have to try,<br> whether I'm here or not.<br> I'll tell you what you could do<br> if you went away.<br> If you can find someplace where<br> they pay wages for talking silly...<br> you could make a fortune.<br> - Addie, a party! What for?<br> - Nothing.<br> I had the sweet butter,<br> so I made the cakes.<br> Isn't this nice?<br> A party just for us.<br> - Is Mama...<br> - No, she ain't got back yet.<br> - Sit down, David.<br> - Not by me.<br> I'm not speaking to him.<br> He's too dull. He's always preaching.<br> - It doesn't affect your appetite.<br> - It doesn't affect me in any way.<br> - I just ignore him.<br> - Don't be bad friends.<br> It's so nice here with just us.<br> - There, David, that's for you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Elderberry's good for the stomach.<br> - That's what Mama used to say.<br> Mama used to give it to me<br> when I was a little girl...<br> for hiccups.<br> I don't think people<br> get hiccups anymore.<br> - Isn't that funny?<br> - And nobody gets growing pains no more.<br> Just like there was some style<br> in what you got.<br> One year an ailment's stylish,<br> and the next year it ain't.<br> Miss Birdie, that elderberry wine<br> is gonna give you a headache spell.<br> I don't think so.<br> I remember now about the hiccups.<br> It was my first big party,<br> at Lionnet.<br> There I was with hiccups,<br> and Mama laughing.<br> Mama always laughed.<br> A big party, a lovely dress<br> from Mr. Worth in Paris, France...<br> and hiccups.<br> You know, that was the first day<br> I saw Oscar Hubbard.<br> We saw him from our window.<br> He passed and lifted his hat.<br> And my brother, to tease Mama,<br> said Mama didn't like the Hubbards...<br> and wouldn't invite them to the party<br> because they kept a store.<br> Then I saw Mama angry<br> for the first time in my life.<br> She said that wasn't the reason.<br> She said she just didn't like people<br> who made their money...<br> charging awful interest<br> to poor, ignorant colored folks...<br> and cheating them<br> on what they bought.<br> Mama was very angry.<br> Then suddenly<br> she laughed and said...<br> "Look, I've frightened Birdie<br> out of her hiccups. "<br> And so she had.<br> They were all gone.<br> Yes, they got mighty well-off<br> cheating the poor.<br> There's people that eats up the whole<br> Earth and all the people on it...<br> like in the Bible<br> with the locust.<br> Then there's people that<br> stand around and watch them do it.<br> Sometimes I think it ain't right<br> to just stand and watch.<br> There's something else<br> in the Bible, Addie.<br> "Take us the foxes...<br> the little foxes<br> that spoil the vines...<br> for our vines<br> have tender grapes. "<br> If we could only go back<br> to Lionnet.<br> Everybody would be better there.<br> They'd be good and kind.<br> I like people to be kind.<br> Don't you like people to be kind?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Yes.<br> That was the first day<br> I ever saw Oscar.<br> Who would have thought...<br> Do you want to know something?<br> I don't like Leo.<br> My very own son,<br> and I don't like him.<br> Isn't that funny?<br> I guess I even like Oscar<br> more than I like Leo.<br> Why did you marry Uncle Oscar?<br> That's no question<br> for you to ask.<br> Why not? It's time<br> she was asking questions.<br> She's heard enough around here<br> to ask anything.<br> - Why did you, Aunt Birdie?<br> - I don't know.<br> I thought I liked him,<br> and he was so kind to me then.<br> I thought it was because<br> he liked me too.<br> But that wasn't the reason.<br> Ask why he married me.<br> I can tell you that!<br> - He's told me often enough.<br> - Miss Birdie, don't.<br> My family was good, but the cotton<br> on Lionnet's fields was better.<br> Ben Hubbard wanted the cotton,<br> and Oscar Hubbard married it for him.<br> He was kind to me then.<br> He used to smile at me.<br> He hasn't smiled at me since.<br> Everybody knew that's<br> what he married me for.<br> Everybody but me.<br> Stupid, stupid me.<br> You get talking like this,<br> and you'll surely get a headache.<br> I've never had a headache<br> in my life!<br> You know it as well as I do.<br> I've never had a headache, Zan.<br> That's a lie they tell for me.<br> I drink.<br> All by myself in my own room,<br> I drink.<br> And when they want to hide it,<br> they say Birdie's got a headache again.<br> - Aunt Birdie, don't.<br> - You won't like me anymore.<br> - I love you. I'll always love you.<br> - Don't! Don't love me!<br> Because in 20 years,<br> you'll just be like me.<br> They'll do all<br> the same things to you...<br> and you'll trail after them<br> just like me...<br> hoping they won't be<br> so mean to you that day...<br> or say something<br> to make you feel so bad.<br> Only you'll be worse off...<br> because you won't have<br> my mama to remember.<br> Aunt Birdie, don't.<br> Come on now. Let's go home,<br> just you and me.<br> Poor Miss Birdie.<br> - There you are, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> I sure is glad<br> to see you back again, sir.<br> - Thank you, Harold.<br> - Glad to see you back with us again.<br> - Thank you. How's the family?<br> - Hello, Mr. Horace.<br> - How are you feeling?<br> - Fine.<br> Hello, Mr. Horace.<br> - How are you, Mr. Giddens?<br> - Sam.<br> - Good to see you, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Hello there, Leo.<br> - Hello, Uncle Horace.<br> - Glad to see you back again, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Good to see you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Goodness! "Good to see you.<br> Good to see you. "<br> Don't nobody never think up<br> no new words?<br> - All right. Come along, son.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> First time I seen anybody who wasn't<br> anxious to grab my silver dollars.<br> Sam, I want to take a look<br> at my will.<br> All right, sir.<br> Come on, son,<br> count my money.<br> You're mighty careless<br> with other people's money.<br> - Count it. I'm in a hurry.<br> - Check this...<br> Check this for me, Joe.<br> I've got to see my uncle a minute.<br> All right.<br> What's the matter with him?<br> Yes, what is it?<br> I want to see you a minute.<br> Yes? What about?<br> - It's about Bert Pembrook.<br> - Yes?<br> He's one of the standing renters<br> over at...<br> I know who Bert Pembrook is.<br> What about him?<br> It's his note, sir.<br> I'm worried about it, Uncle Horace.<br> What's wrong with the note?<br> Do you think the crop lien<br> is sufficient collateral?<br> All right, Sam,<br> you can put it back.<br> I haven't been in the bank<br> for months.<br> I don't know anything<br> about Bert Pembrook's note.<br> - What's wrong with it?<br> - Leo seems disturbed about it.<br> Oh, it's nothing.<br> I just thought...<br> He doesn't think the crop lien<br> is sufficient collateral.<br> We haven't got a crop lien,<br> we've got a chattel mortgage.<br> Bert's made all the payments so far.<br> The note will be amortized in 60 days.<br> Yes, I...<br> Oh, that's right. So it will.<br> Leo's facts seem<br> to be a trifle hazy.<br> It ain't the facts that are hazy.<br> It's Leo.<br> Sam, I forgot my insurance policies.<br> I want to take them with me.<br> When was the last time<br> you opened this box?<br> About three weeks ago<br> to clip the coupons.<br> - Why? Anything wrong?<br> - No, I...<br> I thought there was a policy missing,<br> but I found it.<br> I think I'll go home now,<br> and I'll take the box with me.<br> All right, sir.<br> Good-bye.<br> Bye. We hope to see you<br> back again real soon.<br> It sure is good to see you.<br> Uncle Horace, forgot<br> to ask you how you're feeling.<br> Much better.<br> Thank you for being so solicitous.<br> Don't you worry about the bank. We'll<br> keep everything in apple-pie order.<br> That's nice.<br> That Mr. Leo acting mighty sweet.<br> Like his mouth's filled<br> with melting butter.<br> Yes.<br> - Cal?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - I want you to do something for me.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> After you take me home,<br> I want you to walk back to the bank.<br> I want you to give Mr. Manders<br> a message for me.<br> Yes, sir. Only I ain't much good<br> at toting messages.<br> My memory kind of gets confused.<br> This is an easy one. Only you've got<br> to be sure to get it straight.<br> Listen carefully.<br> I want you to go to Mr. Manders,<br> and I want you to say...<br> Mr. Horace say for you to be taking<br> the evening train for Mobile...<br> and be toting back with you<br> Judge Sol Fowler, his attorney at law...<br> - What's he want him now for?<br> - Is this message for you?<br> - Go on.<br> - Now I got to be starting all over.<br> Mr. Horace say for you to be taking<br> the evening train for Mobile...<br> and be toting back with you<br> Judge Sol Fowler, his attorney at law...<br> and then you got to fetch him<br> to our house tomorrow.<br> - Did he say why?<br> - Is that all?<br> Yes, sir, that's all.<br> Kind of short message, ain't it?<br> Appears to me, if you got a message,<br> it ought to have more words.<br> Mr. Manders, sir, there's something<br> I got to do, something I forgot.<br> - Sit down and finish your work.<br> - But you don't understand.<br> Sit down!<br> - You can tell him I got his message.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Perhaps you're tired?<br> Zan left me instructions<br> not to get tired while she was out.<br> - She's mighty firm with me.<br> - Zan, firm?<br> - What do you feel about Zan anyway?<br> - What?<br> I'm in love with her, I guess.<br> I mean, I'm not guessing.<br> I mean, I know I am.<br> I've never said those words before.<br> I didn't realize<br> they'd be so hard to say.<br> Here's your old green lamp.<br> You don't gotta sit in the dark.<br> Do hurry, Mrs. Hewitt.<br> It's very tiresome standing so long.<br> Yes, I know it is.<br> I'm just finishing.<br> David is a constant visitor<br> at our house.<br> Yes, he plays cribbage<br> with Mr. Horace.<br> He likes Mr. Horace.<br> I hope you don't mind<br> his running in and out.<br> I don't mind. I've always tried not<br> to interfere with Alexandra too much.<br> I didn't like people to interfere<br> with me when I was young.<br> I still don't like them interfering.<br> I do think Alexandra is a little young<br> to be courted by David.<br> I'm sure it's nothing like that.<br> Is that you, David?<br> - Yes, Mama.<br> - Come in.<br> - Good evening.<br> - We were just talking about you.<br> Yes, I heard you.<br> I rather like you.<br> You've got spirit.<br> That's good in anyone.<br> I was telling your mother...<br> I wouldn't like to think<br> you were courting Alexandra.<br> I haven't been doing that.<br> I'm glad to hear that.<br> But, if and when I do, I shall not care<br> whether you like it or not.<br> Don't worry about that. Horace might<br> see his lawyer about a lot of things.<br> Fowler's come down here<br> a hundred times before.<br> But he comes in the bank today,<br> and right after he sends for Fowler.<br> Nonsense.<br> Don't worry so much.<br> It's fine for you<br> to tell me not to worry.<br> Always say to myself<br> I don't like nervous people.<br> I can't trust them.<br> Leo, you're one of the people<br> who bore me.<br> I'm getting too old<br> to want to be bored.<br> I'm just getting so I hate it.<br> You take your nerves out of here<br> and go upstairs and take a warm bath.<br> That will be good for you.<br> A nice warm bath.<br> We agreed you were to stay in your part<br> of this house and I in mine.<br> This room is my part<br> of the house.<br> - Please don't come down again.<br> - I won't.<br> I only came down this time<br> to tell you that...<br> we have invested our money in Hubbard<br> Sons and Marshall Cotton Manufacturers.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You haven't seen Ben.<br> When did you change your mind?<br> I didn't change my mind.<br> I didn't invest the money.<br> It was invested for me.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I had $90,000 worth of Union Pacific<br> bonds in this box in the bank.<br> They're not there now.<br> Come and look.<br> Those bonds are negotiable<br> as money, and they're gone.<br> Only $ 15,000 left.<br> $ 75,000 are gone.<br> What kind of a joke are you playing?<br> Is this for my benefit?<br> I don't look in that box very often.<br> Today, because I decided...<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Don't interrupt me again.<br> Today, because I decided to do<br> something, I opened the box and...<br> Do you think I'm crazy enough<br> to believe what you're saying?<br> You don't believe me.<br> That's good.<br> For a minute, I thought perhaps<br> you had taken them.<br> "Taken them"?<br> Where are they?<br> Where did they go?<br> To Chicago.<br> I should guess that at this minute<br> they're with Mr. Marshall.<br> I think Leo took the bonds.<br> - I don't believe it.<br> - This fine gentleman...<br> to whom you were willing<br> to marry your daughter...<br> took the keys<br> and opened the box.<br> I'm only guessing, but remember Oscar<br> made a sudden departure for Chicago...<br> after you and Ben<br> had your great fight.<br> He took with him the bonds<br> that his son had stolen for him.<br> And for Ben, too, of course.<br> - This will make a fine little scandal.<br> - Couldn't it?<br> A fine scandal<br> to hold over their heads.<br> How could they be such fools?<br> But I'm not going to hold it<br> over their heads.<br> What?<br> I'm gonna let them keep the bonds,<br> as a loan from you.<br> A loan, not an investment.<br> An investment would mean<br> a share of the profits.<br> A loan is simply returned.<br> Oh, I see.<br> You're punishing me.<br> I won't let you punish me.<br> If you won't do anything about it,<br> I will.<br> You won't do anything<br> because you can't.<br> You can't make trouble. I shall say<br> and go on saying I lent them the bonds.<br> You would do that?<br> Yes. For once in your life,<br> I'm tying your hands.<br> There's nothing for you to do.<br> Why did you say<br> I was making this loan?<br> I'm making a new will...<br> leaving you exactly<br> $ 75,000 in Union Pacific bonds.<br> The rest, and my insurance,<br> will go to Zan.<br> In the meantime, Ben and Oscar<br> will have returned the bonds, I'm sure,<br> and be very grateful to you.<br> And that will be the end of that.<br> There's nothing you can do to them<br> and nothing you can do to me.<br> You must hate me very much.<br> No, I don't hate you.<br> Perhaps because I remember<br> how much I was in love with you.<br> I don't hate you either.<br> I've only contempt for you.<br> I've always had.<br> Why did you marry me?<br> Because I was lonely<br> when I was young.<br> Yes, lonely.<br> Not in the way<br> people usually mean.<br> I was lonely for all the things<br> I wasn't gonna get.<br> Everybody was so busy at home,<br> and so little place for what I wanted.<br> Then Papa died and left Ben<br> and Oscar all the money.<br> - So you married me.<br> - Yes.<br> I thought you'd get the world for me.<br> You were a small-town clerk then.<br> You haven't changed.<br> - And that wasn't what you wanted.<br> - No, it wasn't.<br> It wasn't what I wanted.<br> But it didn't take me long<br> to find out my mistake.<br> Then it was just as if<br> I couldn't stand the sight of you.<br> I couldn't bear<br> to have you touch me.<br> I thought you were<br> such a soft, weak fool.<br> You were so kind and understanding<br> when I didn't want you near me.<br> The lies and excuses<br> I used to make to you.<br> And you believed them.<br> That was when I began<br> to despise you.<br> Why didn't you leave me?<br> Where was I to go?<br> What money did I have?<br> I didn't think about it much.<br> If I had, I'd have known<br> you'd die before I did.<br> But I couldn't have guessed you'd get<br> heart trouble so early, so bad.<br> I'm lucky.<br> I've always been lucky.<br> I'll be lucky again.<br> The other bottle. Please.<br> Upstairs in my room<br> in the drawer.<br> Upstairs, quick.<br> Addie, quick.<br> Addie, Cal, come here!<br> My goodness,<br> what's the matter?<br> Get his legs, Belle.<br> His special medicine!<br> I'll get it!<br> Cal, bring him<br> in this room here.<br> Lay him down flat.<br> I'll take off his shoes.<br> - Go get Dr. Sloan. Hurry.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Here.<br> I'll get some ice.<br> Hold his mouth.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - Now, don't you fret, honey.<br> Papa!<br> Aunt Regina!<br> I just heard about Uncle Horace.<br> How is he?<br> - Dr. Sloan's in there now.<br> - Is there anything I can do?<br> You can keep quiet,<br> that's what you can do.<br> - Dr. Sloan.<br> - Zan, I'm gonna tell you the truth.<br> It's just a matter<br> of a little while.<br> Yes, Doctor.<br> We just heard down at the store.<br> How is he now?<br> I don't know. Dr. Sloan's with him.<br> They don't want you to do anything.<br> - Is it a bad attack?<br> - Addie didn't say.<br> - I wonder if we should go up?<br> - I think we better wait here.<br> Did you talk to Sloan?<br> Leo, is that Horace's<br> deposit box?<br> Why...<br> How can it be?<br> If it is, what's it doing here?<br> - You said you saw Manders put it away.<br> - I did see him put it away. I was there.<br> Stop jabbering and tell me<br> is that the same box?<br> Of course it's the same box,<br> but how did it get here?<br> - That means he knows.<br> - Put that down. Are you gonna eat it?<br> - I'll take it back to the bank.<br> - Don't touch it again, you fool.<br> I'm a fool? Didn't I tell you<br> he'd sent for Judge Fowler?<br> And didn't you have me<br> take a warm bath?<br> Yes, I am a fool.<br> I do all the dirty work.<br> - I'm remembering that.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Shut him up<br> or I'll show you what I mean.<br> - But, Papa...<br> - Shut up.<br> Listen to me.<br> Maybe he's told Regina.<br> - Maybe...<br> - Yes, maybe, and maybe he hasn't.<br> They weren't on such pretty terms.<br> If she don't know about it,<br> it may work out all right.<br> If she does know, you're to say<br> he lent you the bonds.<br> Lent me the bonds?<br> Who's gonna believe that?<br> - Nobody.<br> - Why should I say he lent them to me?<br> Why not to you?<br> Why not to Uncle Ben?<br> Because he didn't lend them to me.<br> Remember that.<br> But...<br> How is he?<br> - He's unconscious.<br> - Is there anything we can do?<br> He's come through these attacks before.<br> He'll come through this one.<br> We haven't seen each other<br> since the day of our fight.<br> Remember how we used to fight<br> when we were kids?<br> Trouble brings us together.<br> Does Sloan want another doctor?<br> We could drive over<br> for Dr. Morris.<br> Thank you, but...<br> - You don't feel well.<br> - No, I don't.<br> Horace told me about the bonds<br> this afternoon.<br> - The bonds? What do you mean?<br> - What bonds?<br> Horace's Union Pacific bonds?<br> Yes.<br> What about them?<br> What could he say?<br> He said Leo had stolen them<br> and given them to you.<br> - That's ridiculous!<br> - I don't know what you're talking about.<br> Isn't it enough that he stole them?<br> Do I have to listen to this too?<br> - I didn't steal anything.<br> - Ben, please ask them to stop this.<br> Aren't we starting<br> at the wrong end?<br> What did Horace tell you?<br> He told me that Leo<br> had stolen the bonds.<br> I didn't...<br> Then he said he was going to pretend<br> he had lent them to you...<br> as a present from me<br> to my brothers.<br> He said there was nothing I could do<br> about it because as long as he lived...<br> he would insist<br> he had lent them to you.<br> I told you he lent them.<br> I could've told you.<br> He said he was leaving the rest<br> of the money to Alexandra.<br> So I'm very badly off, you see.<br> Now, you mustn't feel that way.<br> It can all be explained.<br> It can all be adjusted.<br> Things aren't as bad as you seem...<br> So you at least are willing<br> to admit the bonds were stolen.<br> I admit no such thing.<br> It's possible Horace made up<br> that part about stealing to tease you...<br> or perhaps to punish you.<br> It's not a pleasant story.<br> I feel bad.<br> Now you shall have the bonds<br> safely back.<br> - That was the understanding.<br> - Yes.<br> I'm glad to hear that.<br> I had greater hopes.<br> Remember the night<br> we made all the wishes?<br> Now you mustn't talk that way.<br> That's foolish.<br> I think we ought<br> to drive over for Morris.<br> Two doctors are better than one.<br> Don't think I'm dismissing<br> this other business. I'm not.<br> We'll have it all out<br> on a more appropriate day.<br> I don't think<br> you'd better go yet.<br> - Come back and sit down.<br> - We'll be right back.<br> I have something more to say.<br> I've told you before:<br> You'll get further with a smile.<br> I'm a soft man<br> for a woman's smile.<br> I'm smiling, Ben.<br> I'm smiling because<br> you are perfectly safe...<br> while Horace lives<br> to say he lent you the bonds.<br> But Dr. Sloan doesn't think<br> Horace is gonna live.<br> And if he doesn't,<br> I want 75 percent of the business...<br> in exchange for the bonds.<br> Greedy.<br> What a greedy girl you are.<br> You want so much of everything.<br> Get those bays hitched up.<br> I'll drive over there myself.<br> I'll have that doctor here<br> in no time.<br> Regina, you tell Sloan<br> that we're bringing Dr. Morris.<br> Yes, Ben, I'll tell him.<br> Make some fresh coffee.<br> You run over to Mrs. Sloan's<br> and get another hypodermic needle.<br> He's just the same.<br> Zan's all right.<br> She's being fine.<br> I told her you was here, and she said<br> for you to go home and get your supper.<br> Go on now. You don't sit still good.<br> Lots of people don't.<br> All right.<br> I'll be back later.<br> - Can I go with you, Uncle Ben?<br> - You stay right here.<br> You drive to Dr. Morris'<br> in Centerville as fast as you can.<br> Leo, did you speak to the doctor?<br> What did he say?<br> Why's everybody getting so excited?<br> Uncle Horace isn't all that sick.<br> He's had these attacks before.<br> He'll get over it.<br> - I just asked what the doctor said.<br> - What do you care? What's it to you?<br> Why are you here anyway?<br> Showing off your grief?<br> I happen to like Mr. Horace.<br> Good night.<br> Yes, you happen to like him, and he<br> happens to have a rich daughter...<br> so you happen<br> to be hanging around.<br> I'd like to stay here<br> for a little while. Alone, please.<br> Please, Mama.<br> How is he, Regina?<br> He's dead.<br> You look tired.<br> Why don't you go and rest now?<br> Yes, I am tired.<br> Would you pour me a brandy, please?<br> Get one for yourselves.<br> Perhaps we're all going to need it.<br> Are you getting a cold, Oscar?<br> Ben, shall we take up<br> our conversation where we left off?<br> What more is there<br> to talk about?<br> Really, Oscar, you're not<br> very bright, are you?<br> Ben, would you like to<br> or shall I explain to Oscar...<br> that you were quite safe while Horace<br> lived to say he lent you the bonds.<br> But Horace is not alive now.<br> I've already said I want 75 percent of<br> the new firm in exchange for the bonds.<br> This I have not said:<br> If I don't get what I want,<br> I'll put all of you in jail.<br> What are you talking about?<br> On what evidence would you<br> put Oscar and Leo in jail?<br> Listen to him, Oscar. He's getting ready<br> to swear it was you and Leo.<br> Don't be angry, Oscar.<br> I'll see he goes in with you.<br> They were Horace's bonds.<br> There's nothing you can do.<br> - He was willing to loan them to us.<br> - Stop pretending.<br> - Tomorrow I'm going to Judge Simms.<br> - What proof of all this...<br> The bonds are missing, and they're<br> with Marshall. That's proof enough.<br> If it isn't,<br> I'll add what's necessary.<br> - I'm sure of that.<br> - We'll deny...<br> Deny your heads off.<br> What jury would believe you?<br> I don't think you could find 12 men<br> in this state you haven't cheated.<br> What kind of talk is this?<br> We're your own brothers.<br> How can you talk this way<br> when not five minutes ago...<br> Yes, Mama...<br> not five minutes ago.<br> We know how you feel.<br> The whole town loved<br> and respected your father.<br> Did you love him,<br> Uncle Oscar?<br> Did you love him,<br> Uncle Ben?<br> And you, Mama,<br> did you love him too?<br> Go lie down, my dear.<br> It takes time for all of us...<br> to get over a shock like this.<br> Please go.<br> What was Papa doing<br> on the staircase?<br> Go and rest.<br> - I want to talk to you, Mama.<br> - Not now.<br> I'll wait.<br> I've plenty of time now.<br> As I was saying, tomorrow morning<br> I'm going to Judge Simms.<br> - I shall tell him about Leo.<br> - Not in front of the child.<br> I didn't ask her to stay.<br> Where was I?<br> Yes, they'll convict you.<br> But, of course, you have your choice.<br> I don't want to hear any more.<br> There will be no more bargaining!<br> I'll take my 75 percent<br> and forget the story forever.<br> That's one way of doing it<br> and the way I prefer.<br> You should know me well enough to know<br> I don't mind taking the other way.<br> None of us have ever<br> known you well enough.<br> You're getting old, Ben. Your tricks<br> aren't as smart as they used to be.<br> All right, then, I take it that's<br> settled, and I get what I asked for.<br> - Are you going to let her do this?<br> - You have a suggestion?<br> No, he hasn't.<br> Come, Leo and Oscar.<br> You can go home now.<br> Good night.<br> You too, Ben.<br> If you all behave yourselves,<br> I'll forget anybody saw the bonds.<br> You can draw up<br> the necessary papers tomorrow.<br> Be quick about it because I'm not<br> very good at this legal business.<br> You boys are sort of working<br> for me from now on.<br> You're a good loser.<br> I like that.<br> I say to myself:<br> What's the good?<br> You and I aren't like Oscar.<br> We're not sour people.<br> I think that comes<br> from a good digestion.<br> Then too, one loses today<br> and wins tomorrow.<br> I say to myself: Years of planning<br> and I get what I want.<br> Then I don't get it.<br> But I'm not discouraged.<br> The world's open for people<br> like you and me.<br> There's thousands of us<br> all over the world.<br> We'll own this country some day.<br> They won't try to stop us.<br> - We'll get along.<br> - I think so.<br> Then too, I say to myself:<br> Things may change.<br> I agree with Alexandra.<br> What was a man in a wheelchair<br> doing on a staircase?<br> - I ask myself that.<br> - And what do you answer?<br> I have no answer.<br> Maybe someday I will.<br> Maybe never,<br> but maybe someday.<br> - When I do, I'll let you know.<br> - Write me. I'll be in Chicago.<br> I will.<br> Good night, Alexandra.<br> You're turning out to be<br> a right interesting girl.<br> Good night.<br> What was it you wanted<br> to talk to me about?<br> I've changed my mind, Mama.<br> There's nothing<br> to talk about now.<br> I know you've had a bad shock...<br> but you must have<br> expected this to come.<br> You knew how sick he was.<br> Yes, we all knew<br> how sick he was.<br> I'm very tired,<br> and I'm going up to bed.<br> Put all the lights out<br> or the whole town will be over.<br> Be sure the windows are all closed.<br> The rain may come in.<br> Don't sit there<br> staring like that.<br> You've been with Birdie so much,<br> you're getting just like her.<br> That's what Aunt Birdie said.<br> Yes, I might have been<br> just like her.<br> Don't grieve too much. You'll be better<br> when you get to Chicago.<br> I'm gonna get you the world<br> I always wanted.<br> I don't want the world, Mama.<br> I'm not going to Chicago with you.<br> You're very upset.<br> Let's talk about it tomorrow.<br> There's nothing to talk about.<br> I'm going away from you<br> because I want to.<br> Because I know Papa<br> would want me to.<br> You know your papa would want you<br> to go away from me?<br> Yes.<br> And if I say no?<br> Say it, Mama.<br> Say it and see what happens.<br> You're very serious about this,<br> aren't you?<br> You'll change your mind<br> in a couple of days.<br> I've come to the end of my rope!<br> Somewhere there's got to be<br> what I want too. Life goes too fast.<br> You can go where you want,<br> do what you want, think what you want.<br> I'd like to keep you with me,<br> but I won't make you stay.<br> You couldn't, Mama, because<br> I don't want to stay with you.<br> Because I'm beginning<br> to understand about things.<br> Addie said there were people<br> who ate the Earth...<br> and people who stood around<br> and watched them do it.<br> Just now, Uncle Ben said the same thing,<br> really the same thing.<br> Tell him for me, Mama,<br> I'm not going to watch you do it.<br> Tell him I'll be fighting<br> as hard as he is...<br> someplace where people<br> don't just stand around and watch.<br> Why, you have spirit after all.<br> I used to think<br> you were all sugar water.<br> We don't have to be bad friends.<br> I don't want us to be bad friends.<br> Would you like<br> to talk with me, Alexandra?<br> Would you like to sleep<br> in my room tonight?<br> Why, Mama?<br> Are you afraid?<br>
