I'll bandage him up.<br> Look at this, sir.<br> So that's the trouble, Driscoll.<br> Take him aft.<br> - You'll get no money for this last work.|- But...<br> I'll teach you to smuggle rum on a ship|and start a riot.<br> senor Capitan.<br> You know the agreement. Rum, no money.<br> senor.<br> These sailors, they bring the rum.<br> - We bring no rum.|- You're lying!<br> Clear out!

How are you?|That's your ship? That's good.<br> I can just see Ole behind that plow.<br> Ole be putting a rudder on the horse's tail<br> and a compass on the plow,<br> so that he'll not be digging potatoes|when it's turnips he's after.<br> Hey, Ole, show us how|you used to call them pigs.<br> If I was a swine, I'd be running|the other way after that devilin' screech.<br> You won't go home. You'll get drunk.<br> The only way you'll see that farm|is through a bottle.<br> You stop that.<br> Stop what, square-head?<br> You don't make a fool of Ole.<br> He's going home.|By devil, you've got no home.<br> I got no home.|None of us got a home but Ole.<br> And if you stop him, I fight you.<br> You go home, Ole.<br> Your mother is old. Where's my hat?<br> She needs you. She wants you.|You don't go anymore on sailing.<br> That's no good, Ole. That's no good.<br> You go home to your mother.<br> She's old, and she needs you.<br> Yeah, I go home.<br> You go home.<br> And here are your instructions|for the stowage of high explosives.<br> - High explosives.|- Are your cargo holds quite dry?<br> Oh, yes.<br> I'm not worried|about keeping the cargo dry,<br> but about getting through the war zone.<br> We haven't enough speed|to run away from a rowboat.<br> Not even a machine gun|to make a fight of it.<br> If anything hits us below the waterline,|we'd go up like a kite.<br> Nevertheless,<br> every ship that gets to England|is helping to win the war.<br> And every officer and man|in the merchant marine is doing his bit.<br> - Unsung heroes...|- Is this when you want us to sail?<br> Oh, yes. Time is very important, you know.<br> Is it?<br> Unsung heroes.<br> Like a curse!<br> Hey, Yank. Drisk.<br> Come here.<br> - Hey. Hey, did you know about this?|- What are you talking about?<br> I was wondering|what all them blooming uniformed guards<br> were hanging around for.<br> - That explains it.|- TNT.<br> TNT, it's high explosives.<br> It's the same thing, isn't it?<br> It's worse. It's ammunition.<br> - By jiminy Christmas.|- The devil with it.<br> Load up an old hooker like this|full of that blooming stuff<br> and what is she? Just a bomb!<br> A great, big dynamite bomb!<br> I quit!<br> Well, we're all quitting, I'm thinking.<br> I'm through.<br> Captain wants you out, men.|Everybody out.<br> Sir, what's the meaning of this?<br> Captain will answer your questions.<br> But we didn't sign on for the kind...<br> - Okay, hop it. He's waiting.|- Well, so are we.<br> All right, let the old man himself explain...<br> By devil, I quit!<br> I ain't gonna sign on this old tub again.<br> As far as this job's concerned,|you men haven't got any names.<br> You're just so many hands,<br> just as I am a boss|to see this cargo gets to England.<br> If it doesn't get there,|it'll be missed, but we won't.<br> Now I know it's the usual thing|for the fo'c's'le hands to grouse.<br> So if anybody's got|any objection to what I've said,<br> well, step forward. Let's hear it.<br> Right. Well from now on|till you're paid off in London,<br> you get 25% bonus on your wages.<br> There's one thing more.<br> Owing to circumstances|over which I've got no control,<br> nobody is allowed to leave the ship.<br> May I ask, sir,|why are we deprived of shore leave?<br> For your own safety.<br> I don't want the cargo|talked about ashore.<br> I think I can be trusted, sir.<br> When you're drunk?<br> I maintain, sir, that we're entitled|to one night ashore before sailing.<br> Yeah, I maintain|you've said enough, Smith.<br> I'm as interested in the welfare|of my ship's crew as you are.<br> No more of your lip.<br> Go on. Back to your work.<br> Roust out, Cocky.<br> Can't you let a man sleep?<br> What about the rest of us?|The old man wants his coffee.<br> That means he's going to the bridge.|And that means we're gonna sail.<br> Shake a leg!<br> Can't let a man sleep.<br> I'll expose him.<br> Coffee!<br> - Well, Captain, goodbye and good luck.|- Goodbye, thank you.<br> Are you quite sure you won't want a pilot?<br> No, no pilot.<br> bon voyage.|- Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> All clear!<br> Glencairn.|- Let's take him aboard!<br> On your feet!<br> Take it away!<br> One of your men, isn't he, mate?<br> Yes. Get aboard, Smith!<br> Get aboard. Take it away!<br> Good night, Drisk.<br> Good night, Donkeyman.|Sweet dreams, too.<br> Full speed ahead, Mister.<br> Alter course.<br> East by north. Half knot.<br> East by north. Half knot.<br> Stop that noise!<br> You square-headed ape.<br> He was playing soft, Drisk.<br> Slow her down a few turns.<br> By golly, I would hate to be|on this old tub in rough weather.<br> Hey, Cocky. Hurry up that Scotch.<br> Come on! Let's shake a leg!<br> Come on, Old Murphy. I'll help you.|Come on.<br> Boys, coming... There you are.|Now, there you are.<br> Them sea biscuits|would break the tooth of a lion<br> if he had the misfortune of biting one.<br> Nothing but scarf upon these rusty...<br> Swill, that's right.<br> It's a starvation ship. My last trip!<br> Plenty of work and nothing to eat.<br> And the owners riding around in carriages.<br> I think it's that blasted cook.<br> Fresh meat for the officers|and hash for the men. That's his notion.<br> Hash, hash! Stew, stew!<br> Marmalade, by jiminy!<br> We hit something?<br> It was the anchor.<br> The anchor's broke loose!<br> - Contact...|- Yank!<br> Mr. Graves?<br> Steady kid.<br> Let me... Let me lie down.<br> I need to lie down.<br> Excuse me, sir,<br> but the men in the fo'c's'le are asking|if you'll take another look at the sick man.<br> Is he worse?<br> He's spitting blood again, sir.|Can you do anything for him, sir?<br> Well, as far as I can make out,<br> those splintered ribs|have punctured his lung.<br> Can you do anything about that, Mister?<br> - Why, no, sir.|- No, neither can I,<br> and I don't think I'm fooling anybody,|pretending to be a doctor.<br> Damn! If it had only happened|a week later, we might have made port.<br> As it is...<br> All right, Mister.

That's it.<br> Are you all crazy?<br> The light. That's where it comes from.|What'd I tell you?<br> Hey! You're showing the lights, you lug.<br> - Who left that open?|- Smitty.<br> Who has done it if Smitty didn't?|It's over his bunk, isn't it?<br> She wink on. She wink off.|Just like wigwag.<br> Hey, what's going on here|behind my back?<br> That's what we're trying to tell you, Drisk.<br> Maybe you won't be thinking|so much of the Duke when you hear it.<br> All right, all right. Out with it.<br> Stop winking and nodding|and making a mystery of things.<br> Keep your eye on the door.<br> - Sing out if you see Smitty coming.|- Yeah.<br> I see him in the chart room,|getting a fix on our course.<br> I caught him in the Captain's cabin,|pouring over the code book,<br> the International Code book.<br> Easy-peasy.<br> Take it easy, Drisk.<br> Shut up.<br> By jiminy! By devil!<br> Are you gonna have it out on deck?<br> Why should we stay here|and be blown to bits?<br> Are you frightened, you toad?<br> Well, it's a fine thing when full grown men<br> shiver like children|at the sight of a little black box.<br> Still, it's a devilish thing, the look of it.<br> "A bit of a black box," you call it?<br> How big do you think it has to be?|As big as this fo'c's'le?<br> It looks bad, so it does.<br> There's only one consolement.<br> The traitor's English.<br> Who says he's English?<br> Haven't you read|how all them German spies<br> has been living for years in London<br> and talks the King's English,|as good as I do.<br> He talks English too good.|That's what I mean.<br> That's right.<br> I never met a swell|that talked the way he does.<br> Now, listen, Drisk,<br> was he ever open with us|like a good shipmate?<br> No, he always keeps to himself|like he was hiding something.<br> And the name he calls himself, Smith.<br> I'll bet a buck on my next payday|that his real name is Schmidt.<br> Schmidt.<br> By devil, Schmidt!<br> Devil take me|if I don't think you have the truth of it.<br> I wish he didn't come back|after he jumped ship in United States.<br> Jumped ship. Jumped ship!<br> He was passing the word|to some German bloke<br> about the ammunition we're carrying.<br> I'll lay odds he was trying to sneak in|onboard when they nabbed him.<br> Well, I never was afraid|of anything or anyone.<br> - Don't monkey with it.|- Let's see face to face.<br> - Now get out of here!|- Careful, Drisk.<br> - Get that bucket of water.|- What are you gonna do with it, Drisk?<br> I'll show you what I'll do|with this Devil's machinery.<br> The devil's got you hot as a clam bake?<br> You guys keep out of this.

Let's get out of this rat hole.<br> Ole's gone.<br> What'll you have, whiskey?<br> Irish whiskey.<br> That's a queer thing for Ole to be doing.<br> If Ole's gone to the steamer, Drisk,|we got time to catch him.<br> Well, we've come to see him off anyway.<br> Well, come on now. Sling your hooks!<br> - Shall we go?|- Goodbye, mate!<br> - Happy trip.|- Goodbye!<br> - Goodbye. Goodbye.|- Goodbye.<br> It's not in my nature|to feel unkindly toward any man,<br> to be holding a grudge inside of me|when I might let bygones be bygones.<br> - Thank you, mate.|- So feeling in a merciful mood toward you<br> - when I might never see you again...|- Now.<br> ...it would be a hard thing to have on me.<br> Of course, it would. Of course.<br> So...<br> Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy!<br> Excuse me, mates, but you haven't got it|quite right. It goes something like this.<br> - Where's Ole?|- Where's Ole?<br> - What did you do to him?|- Where's Ole?<br> Driscoll.<br> Yes, Driscoll, you...<br> - Ole!|- Ole!<br> Come on!<br> Quick!<br> Ole!
