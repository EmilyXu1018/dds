                        At every beach, on every dune...<br> ...on every rock.<br> I repeat:<br> I've ordered alerts again and again.<br> Tell me this:<br> -Anything else?<br> -No, sir.<br> Good morning, Field Marshal.<br> -Any news?<br> -Nothing important.<br> Snap it up. Jerk the lead.<br> Snap it up.<br> Jerk the lead.<br> Snap it up.<br> Jerk the lead.<br> You expect us to eat this slop again?<br> I don't care what you do with it, mac.<br> Eat it, throw it out.<br> I get paid for cooking it.<br> Come on. Put it on.<br> Snap it up.<br> Jerk the lead.<br> Didn't you get any sleep?<br> Are you kidding? I haven't slept<br> since we got here.<br> I got the absolute lowdown.<br> It's on for tonight. For sure.<br> Yeah.<br> I got in this crap game<br> with this guy from F Company.<br> -He's an orderly for some general.<br> -Move it. Move it.<br> Hey, Hutchy!<br> Hutchy, I want to ask you something.<br> Hey, Hutchinson...<br> ...do you think they'd let me write<br> home? If it was really important?<br> Not likely, mate. Security.<br> I don't think old Churchill trusts us.<br> It's the wife, you see.<br> She's going to have a baby.<br> Your first, is it?<br> Oh, it's not mine, but I'm dead<br> worried about her.<br> She's not too strong, you see.<br> Man, that stink.<br> Diesel oil, backed-up toilets, vomit.<br> And there ain't no place left<br> to get sick in.<br> The puke bags is full.<br> The fire buckets is full.<br> All we got left is our helmets.<br> June.<br> Every June my old man<br> used to take me camping...<br> ...up in the Blue Mountains.<br> We'd hunt and fish all day long.<br> And at night...<br> ...we'd sleep out under the stars.<br> Didn't even need a blanket.<br> June.<br> Wind and rain. Wind and rain.<br> Don't it ever stop?<br> Look, Dad, all I want<br> to do is get going.<br> Wind or no wind. Even if we land<br> in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.<br> -Come to think of it...<br> -Colonel wants us.<br> All of us.<br> All troops will participate<br> in ground tactics and deployment.<br> In this weather, sir?<br> Of course, Harding, if you can ensure<br> that we'll land in France...<br> -...in sunshine and dry weather.<br> -Didn't mean that.<br> -What did you mean?<br> -It isn't the weather.<br> It's the waiting.<br> These men are itching to go.<br> I don't think I have to remind you...<br> ...that this war has been going on<br> for almost five years.<br> Half of Europe has been<br> overrun and occupied.<br> We're comparative newcomers.<br> England's gone through a blitz with<br> a knife at her throat since 1940.<br> I am quite sure that they too<br> are impatient and itching to go.<br> Do I make myself clear?<br> Yes, sir. Quite clear.<br> Three million men penned up<br> on this island.<br> All over England,<br> in staging areas like this.<br> We're on the threshold<br> of the most crucial day of our times.<br> Three million men out there...<br> ...keyed up, and waiting for<br> that big step-off.<br> They aren't exactly alone.<br> Notify the men. Full packs<br> and equipment, 14:00 hours.<br> Yes, sir.<br> This allows you more freedom.<br> Quicker to get rid of<br> when we hit the beach.<br> -Well?<br> -It's on.<br> Tonight, as scheduled.<br> -If the weather isn't worse.<br> -How worse can it get?<br> Ike has called a high-level<br> conference for 9:30.<br> I am not Eisenhower. I am<br> an assistant division commander.<br> I don't know from nothing,<br> but he can't call it off again.<br> Frank, turn that thing off.<br> Four thousand ships loaded for bear.<br> Troops ready to go.<br> Eleven thousand planes on the line.<br> Eighteen thousand paratroopers.<br> God only knows how many gliders.<br> Norm, relax.<br> RAF says the gale can stop<br> as suddenly as it began.<br> So they told us yesterday<br> and the day before.<br> Look, Norm.<br> We're all of us just as...<br> ...dedicated to this thing as you are,<br> just as anxious to get going.<br> And that includes Ike.<br> Now if he calls it off again,<br> he knows what he's doing.<br> Of course he does. I know that.<br> I'm just thinking about those<br> assault troops. 200,000 of them...<br> ...out there on those ships.<br> They're probably seasick as hell.<br> Some of those men have been<br> on those tubs for almost three days.<br> I say go.<br> Go. Weather or no weather.<br> No!<br> A hundred on the bone! Let's go.<br> -Hey, give me $50. I'm busted.<br> -I'm not doing so good myself.<br> Hey, lend me $50?<br> -Lend me 20 bucks?<br> -Drop dead.<br> Lend me $ 10?<br> -Fifty on a bet.<br> -I got it.<br> One, two, three, four, five.<br> Fifty!<br> Let me hear it, let me hear it.<br> -Five and two, four and three.<br> -Six! That's the way we go!<br> Seven points in a row. It ain't<br> logical, it just ain't logical.<br> -There's a hundred out there.<br> -$ 100 dollars, $20 dollars.<br> Anything open?<br> -Forty more.<br> -Forty more.<br> You got a bet.<br> -Okay, you mother-loving...<br> -Just a minute. Wait a minute.<br> Here you are. Use this.<br> -You don't think I'd...<br> -I don't think anything.<br> I just like to hear the sound<br> when it comes out of the cup.<br> That's it. Shake it.<br> Okay. Let me see what you do<br> with it now. Go ahead. Shoot.<br> -What is it?<br> -Nothing.<br> -Seven!<br> -That's what I wanted!<br> Who put this cup in the game?<br> -Next shooter. Who's coming up?<br> -I'll go $ 100.<br> He's shooting a hundred.<br> Who's got it?<br> -Watch your side bets.<br> -$ 100.<br> You got a letter for me.<br> Schultz, huh?<br> Yeah, that's it.<br> Thanks, buddy.<br> -How much did you take him for?<br> -Not much. Just a hair over $2500.<br> -$2500?<br> -Yeah.<br> Oh, man, $2500?<br> It's too bad you had to win it now.<br> What do you mean, now?<br> Suppose we take off tonight.<br> What will you do with it?<br> Five I take with me to Paris<br> to blow on the broads and wine.<br> A thou I leave here for seed<br> when I get back.<br> And the rest I send to my mother.<br> Oh, man, $2500. And in Paris.<br> You always was lucky.<br> Hey, remember that night<br> in Fort Bragg?<br> I remember it.<br> You know, I think I sneak over there<br> and give it a big whang myself.<br> Why not? What's to lose?<br> Damn it.<br> Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg?<br> I was lucky, all right,<br> in that crap game.<br> Next day I break my leg in a jump.<br> And two months in traction.<br> $2500.<br> That's more money I ever had<br> in my whole life.<br> I know.<br> Man, I just know.<br> I wonder how long it takes<br> to lose $2500?<br> Pint of sludge, Ted.<br> Oh, hello, Dave.<br> Hey, you seen Johnny?<br> Yes.<br> Well, where is he?<br> Come on, Dave.<br> I need my boots.<br> Johnny's borrowed them.<br> Where is he?<br> At the bottom...<br> ...of the Channel.<br> You mean...<br> ...he's bought it?<br> Ack-ack over Calais.<br> He jumped clean,<br> but his parachute didn't open.<br> That leaves just you<br> in the squadron, Dave.<br> I mean, of the old 1940 mob.<br> What's always worried me<br> about being one of the few...<br> ...is the way we keep on<br> getting fewer.<br> Yeah.<br> Poor old Johnny.<br> Bad luck, it happening now.<br> -Now, then. What's the difference?<br> -He went through the Battle of Britain!<br> And now if the big show<br> starts tonight...<br> ...he won't be in it.<br> Look, will you please<br> shut up about him?<br> All right, all right.<br> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br> You heard something about tonight?<br> No, no. I haven't heard anything.<br> -What are you talking about then?<br> -Well, it's just...<br> -Go on, go on.<br> -I have a feeling it's on for tonight.<br> -That's all.<br> -A feeling.<br> Take your feeling somewhere else.<br> I've got a letter to write.<br> I've had this feeling since I woke up.<br> I've had it with me all day long.<br> I can't shake it off.<br> It's tonight. I know it is.<br> All right, it's tonight.<br> Suits me fine.<br> Tonight. This afternoon. Now!<br> I mean...<br> ...as soon as I finish this beer.<br> -General, can you spare me a minute?<br> -Come in.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Can I get you coffee?<br> -No, thanks.<br> -I'll get some for myself.<br> Is it still raining?<br> On and off, off and on.<br> Sometimes I wonder<br> which side God's on.<br> What?<br> I say, sometimes I wonder<br> which side God's on.<br> Good question.<br> What's on your mind, Van?<br> I'm concerned about the placement<br> of our drop zones.<br> Go on.<br> I know this is a hell of a late date<br> to bring up something new...<br> ...but you've given me<br> a tough nut to crack.<br> -It gets tougher every time I try.<br> -I know, Van.<br> Sainte-Mre-Eglise straddles<br> the only road the Germans can use...<br> ...to drive into our northern flank.<br> But it has to be taken.<br> And it has to be held.<br> That's why I gave you the job, Van.<br> -Can I use your board?<br> -Of course.<br> Here's the town. Heavily fortified.<br> Down here is the swamp area<br> that the Germans have flooded.<br> And in between, four miles<br> from the town, is our drop zone.<br> Now if anything goes wrong<br> and we undershoot...<br> ...we land in this flooded area<br> and are bogged down.<br> If we overshoot, we come down<br> like clay pigeons...<br> ...smack dab in the center<br> of Sainte-Mre-Eglise.<br> That's why I gave the men training<br> in low-level jumps near the villages.<br> So I've heard.<br> Got a complaint from<br> the city council at Bexhall.<br> Some of your men overshot<br> the drop zone and landed in the town.<br> -Tied up traffic for an hour.<br> -That's true, sir. I was with them.<br> Sudden crosswind hit us,<br> swept us over the treetops...<br> ...scattered us all over the place.<br> -Where did you end up?<br> -In the courtyard of a convent.<br> Relax, Van. Sit down.<br> The last few months have been<br> a tough grind on all of us.<br> I hear you've been working yourself<br> and your battalion hard.<br> Almost without a stop.<br> Now that we're almost<br> at the end of the line...<br> ...why don't you try easing up<br> on yourself and on the men?<br> Sometimes a battalion can be<br> sharpened to too fine a point.<br> Sometimes a commander can too.<br> Well...<br> ...if there's any further delay...<br> ...I request permission to submit<br> a new placement for our drop zones.<br> All right. Put it in writing.<br> Make it official.<br> That's your prerogative.<br> But Ike has called a final meeting<br> for tonight at Southwick House.<br> If it's on, we'll get<br> the green light by 9:30.<br> -What are the chances?<br> -Better than 50-50.<br> Forget everything I said. I got<br> the best battalion in this division...<br> ...and they're ready.<br> Here it is. The latest report.<br> -It's Southwick House, sir.<br> -Stagg here.<br> Yes, sir. The new front's moving in<br> much faster than we thought.<br> Yes, sir, it's definitely improving.<br> I'll be there, sir. 9:30.<br> -Would you like some more tea, sir?<br> -Coffee, and make it black.<br> Please.<br> What's that you're saying?<br> But you know I can't get there<br> with my equipment for two days.<br> I wouldn't be surprised if...<br> -When's the next weather report?<br> -Tonight at 8, General.<br> Yes, I did, General.<br> Please wish her a happy birthday.<br> Thank you, Speidel.<br> In Normandy.<br> Trying to pick a trend is difficult.<br> From a meteorological standpoint,<br> conditions almost resemble mid-winter.<br> And Normandy?<br> High winds, clouds,<br> and some fog over the beaches.<br> However, I can say with a certain<br> degree of safety...<br> ...that we can expect a brief period<br> of fair conditions.<br> Let me summarize, then.<br> What you're promising us is a barely<br> tolerable period of fair conditions.<br> Am I right?<br> Yes.<br> Conditions that are far below<br> the minimum requirements.<br> That's all I can promise.<br> You've done your best, Stagg.<br> Thank you, gentlemen.<br> Well...<br> ...there it is.<br> We've postponed the attack<br> once already.<br> Now, either we go on the 6th,<br> with only marginal conditions...<br> ...or postpone again...<br> ...in the hope of getting<br> perfect conditions.<br> What do you think, Monty?<br> I say, go. Go.<br> I must remind everybody...<br> ...that the American convoy<br> for the Omaha and Utah beaches...<br> ...they've farthest to go...<br> ...must be given the order<br> within the next half-hour...<br> ...if the assault is to take place<br> on the 6th.<br> We can't keep almost a quarter<br> of a million men on ships...<br> ...in embarkation areas, indefinitely.<br> The longer we wait, the more<br> acute our security problem.<br> The next time...<br> ...the tides and the moon<br> will be right...<br> Not before July.<br> Gentlemen...<br> ...such a postponement...<br> ...is too bitter to contemplate.<br> Never.<br> I'm quite positive<br> we must give the order.<br> I don't like it...<br> ...but there it is.<br> Gentlemen...<br> ...I don't see how we can possibly<br> do anything else but go.<br> Wilson speaking.<br> Yes, sir.<br> It's on, sir. Ike's made the<br> decision. Tonight, as scheduled!<br> Colonel Tomson speaking.<br> Thank you.<br> Next stop...<br> ...Normandy.<br> God help us now.<br> Gentlemen...<br> ...the day we've been<br> waiting for has arrived.<br> Invasion! We're on our way.<br> General.<br> The orders have been given.<br> It's on.<br> Have the battalion commanders<br> join me in the wardroom.<br> All right, Sergeant.<br> You men are the eyes<br> of our airborne army.<br> You, the pathfinders, will have<br> one job, and one job only:<br> To light the drop zones<br> for our paratroops.<br> Along with the British and Canadians<br> you'll be the first men...<br> ...to land in France.<br> And remember this:<br> When you get to Normandy...<br> ...you'll only have one friend:<br> God.<br> And this.<br> This...<br> ...is Rupert.<br> Now, we are going to drop Rupert...<br> ...and a lot more like him...<br> ...behind the invasion area.<br> He's...<br> ...a very extraordinary<br> fellow, Rupert.<br> He's sort of a...<br> ...one-man army, all by himself.<br> Let me show you.<br> Let me show you what happens<br> when Rupert...<br> ...hits the ground.<br> Sergeant, switch off<br> the lights, please.<br> All right, Sergeant, that's all.<br> All right, come on. Simmer down.<br> Come on, up.<br> It's possible that Rupert and his men<br> will do the same thing to the Germans.<br> Confuse them, make them look<br> over their shoulders...<br> ...and launch an attack<br> in the wrong direction.<br> Ten-hut!<br> -The crickets have been distributed.<br> -So I heard.<br> At ease!<br> You're as ready as we can make you.<br> This five-cent toy...<br> ...wasn't issued to you for laughs.<br> It may save your life.<br> You're gonna be landing in the dark.<br> On the other side of that hedgerow...<br> ...the fellow may not be wearing<br> the same uniform you are. So...<br> ...one click...<br> ...is to be answered by two clicks.<br> And if you don't<br> get that answering click...<br> ...hit the dirt and open fire.<br> I repeat:<br> One click...<br> ...must be answered by two clicks.<br> Now, hang on to this gimmick.<br> It's as important as your weapon.<br> Do you read me?<br> Loud and clear, sir.<br> All right.

I don't even<br> know if the landings took place.<br> But I am sure we're gonna hold<br> this town until the linkup does come.<br> Whenever that is, today, tomorrow,<br> till hell freezes over.<br> For their sake,<br> if for no other reason.<br> Show me the enemy positions.<br> Well, sir, the Germans' strong point<br> is right there.<br> That's over there on the hill.<br> They've got no tanks yet.<br> They've got heavy guns and machine<br> gun positions at the top of that road.<br> How many men have you got?<br> Not enough.<br> Lt. Wilson will take A Company<br> and reinforce Major Lance.<br> The rest of the command will follow us<br> straight up that road.<br> Good luck, Major.<br> All right, A Company, fall out.<br> -Private.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> It's a helluva war.<br> It's a privilege to serve<br> with you, colonel.<br> Well, God willing, we'll do<br> what we came here to do.<br> Ready, sir.<br> Move out!<br> The old man sure has changed<br> since yesterday.<br> Or maybe it's just<br> that we've changed...<br> ...since yesterday.<br> Lovat and his commandos<br> have reached the bridge.<br> Bob, did you hear?<br> Yes, I heard.<br> "Sainte-Mre-Eglise captured<br> by units of the 82nd Airborne."<br> "101 Airborne driving on Utah."<br> That's good. Good.<br> Yes, but if we can't get off Omaha<br> it doesn't mean a damn. We know it.<br> We'll have two cut-off beachheads,<br> one in British zone and one at Utah.<br> Yes...<br> ...and the Germans in between.<br> You guys engineers?<br> Yes, sir. 299th.<br> Where are your officers?<br> Who's in charge here?<br> I guess I am, sir.<br> None of our officers made it in.<br> What about your equipment?<br> Those torpedoes work?<br> Yes, sir, we'll make them work!<br> -What's your name, Sergeant?<br> -It's Fuller, sir, John H.<br> You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on,<br> whether you like it or not.<br> You send some men down to the foot<br> of that gully with those torpedoes.<br> You and the rest of the men follow me.<br> Yes, sir!<br> All right, men!<br> Let's move that equipment down here.<br> -I got a rifle, sir.<br> -Well, good for you, son!<br> The Rangers are ready, General.<br> Okay, Major, move them out.<br> Captain, move them up.<br> Move them up!<br> -Well, Tom?<br> -We're ready.<br> As ready as we'll ever be.<br> It'll work. It's got to work.<br> We're getting murdered here! We might<br> as well move inland and get murdered!<br> -You ready?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> You're gonna blow<br> that roadblock for me.<br> When I give the word<br> everything pops at once. Okay?<br> Yes, sir.<br> First, we gotta blow a hole<br> through that wire with bangalores.<br> If that works, we'll pack<br> everything we've got into that wall.<br> All right, let's go!<br> All right, let's go! Go! Go!<br> You don't say!<br> Don't worry, Yank.<br> He's dead.<br> Give me a cigarette.<br> I'm dying for a cigarette.<br> You hurt bad?<br> Shot down during the night.<br> He was gonna make sure of me,<br> but I got him...<br> ...with this.<br> You ever killed a man?<br> I mean, face to face?<br> No.<br> Neither had I, face to face.<br> I've been sitting here looking at him.<br> Have you noticed anything peculiar<br> about him?<br> No.<br> He's got his boots...<br> ...on the wrong feet.<br> He must have been<br> in a big hurry, huh?<br> Is it bad?<br> Split wide open...<br> ...from the crotch to the knee.<br> A medic came along and gave me<br> a shot of morphine.<br> I hope he'll be back<br> before it wears off.<br> He said he would.<br> Did he sew you up?<br> Well, when he came to shore<br> he lost most of his equipment.<br> So he pinned it together...<br> ...with safety pins.<br> Getting on toward night.<br> You know something?<br> I haven't fired my gun all day.<br> I keep hearing shooting, but every<br> time I get there, everybody's gone.<br> Funny, isn't it?<br> He's dead.<br> I'm crippled.<br> You're lost.<br> I suppose it's always like that.<br> I mean war.<br> I wonder who won.<br> Okay, run me up the hill, son.<br>
