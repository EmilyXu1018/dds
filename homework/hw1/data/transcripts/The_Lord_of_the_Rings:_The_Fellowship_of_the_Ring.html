My love. My own.<br> My precious.<br> The Ring brought to Gollum<br> unnatural long life.<br> For 500 years it poisoned his mind.<br> And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,<br> it waited.<br> Darkness crept back<br> into the forests of the world.<br> Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...<br> ...whispers of a nameless fear.<br> And the Ring of Power perceived...<br> ...its time had now come.<br> It abandoned Gollum.<br> But something happened then<br> the Ring did not intend.<br> It was picked up by the most unlikely<br> creature imaginable.<br> What's this?<br> A Hobbit.<br> Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.<br> A ring.<br> Lost!<br> My precious is lost!<br> For the time will soon come...<br> ...when Hobbits will shape<br> the fortunes of all.<br> The Shire...60 years later<br> Down from the door where it began<br> And I must follow if I can<br> The road goes ever on and on<br> Down from the door where it began<br> Nowfar ahead the road has gone<br> -And I must follow if I can<br> -You're late.<br> A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.<br> Nor is he early. He arrives<br> precisely when he means to.<br> It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!<br> You didn't think I'd miss<br> your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?<br> What news of the outside world?<br> Tell me everything.<br> Everything? You're far too eager<br> and curious for a Hobbit.<br> Most unnatural.<br> Well, what can I tell you?<br> Life in the wide world goes on<br> much as it has this past Age.<br> Full of its own comings and goings.<br> Scarcely aware of the existence<br> of Hobbits.<br> For which I am very thankful.<br> It's Gandalf!<br> The long-expected party.<br> How is the old rascal?<br> I hear it's going to be a party<br> of special magnificence.<br> You know Bilbo.<br> He's got the whole place in an uproar.<br> Well, that should please him.<br> -Half the Shire's been invited.<br> -Gracious me.<br> -He's up to something.<br> -Oh, really?<br> All right, then. Keep your secrets.<br> Before you came along, we Bagginses<br> were very well thought of.<br> Indeed.<br> Never had any adventures<br> or did anything unexpected.<br> If you're referring to the incident<br> with the dragon, I was barely involved.<br> All I did was give your uncle<br> a little nudge out of the door.<br> Whatever you did, you've been officially<br> labeled a disturber of the peace.<br> Oh, really?<br> Gandalf! Gandalf!<br> Fireworks, Gandalf!<br> -Gandalf!<br> -Fireworks, Gandalf!<br> Gandalf?<br> -I'm glad you're back.<br> -So am l, dear boy.<br> So am I.<br> No, thank you!<br> We don't want any more visitors,<br> well-wishers or distant relations!<br> And what about very old friends?<br> Gandalf?<br> -Bilbo Baggins.<br> -My dear Gandalf!<br> Good to see you. 111 years old!<br> Who would believe it?<br> You haven't aged a day.<br> Come on, come in!<br> Welcome, welcome.<br> Oh, here we are.<br> Tea? Or maybe something<br> a little stronger?<br> I've got a few bottles<br> of the Old Winyard left. 1296.<br> Very good year. Almost as old as I am.<br> It was laid down by my father.<br> What say we open one, eh?<br> Just tea, thank you.<br> I was expecting you sometime<br> last week.<br> Not that it matters. You come and go as<br> you please. Always have and always will.<br> You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only<br> got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....<br> There's some cheese here.<br> No, that won't do.<br> We've got raspberry jam,<br> an apple tart....<br> But not much for afters.<br> Oh, no, we're all right.<br> I've just found some sponge cake.<br> I could make you some eggs<br> if you'd--<br> -Just tea, thank you.<br> -Oh, right.<br> -You don't mind if I eat, do you?<br> -No, not at all.<br> Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!<br> I'm not at home!<br> I've got to get away from these confounded<br> relatives, hanging on the bell all day...<br> ...never giving me a moment's peace.<br> I want to see mountains again.<br> Mountains, Gandalf!<br> And then find somewhere quiet<br> where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.<br> -So you mean to go through with your plan?<br> -Yes, yes. It's all in hand.<br> All the arrangements are made.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Frodo suspects something.<br> Of course he does. He's a Baggins...<br> ...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle<br> from Hardbottle.<br> You will tell him, won't you?<br> -Yes, yes.<br> -He's very fond of you.<br> I know.<br> He'd probably come with me<br> if I asked him.<br> I think in his heart, Frodo's<br> still in love with the Shire.<br> The woods, the fields.<br> Little rivers.<br> I am old, Gandalf.<br> I know I don't look it, but I'm<br> beginning to feel it in my heart.<br> I feel thin.<br> Sort of stretched...<br> ...like butter scraped<br> over too much bread.<br> I need a holiday. A very long holiday.<br> And I don't expect I shall return.<br> In fact, I mean not to.<br> Old Toby. The finest weed<br> in the Southfarthing.<br> Gandalf, my old friend...<br> ...this will be a night to remember.<br> Hello, hello.<br> Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.<br> Welcome, welcome.<br> Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.<br> -I think I'll just have another ale.<br> -Oh, no, you don't.<br> Go on!<br> So there I was...<br> ...at the mercy<br> of three monstrous trolls.<br> And they were all arguing<br> amongst themselves...<br> ...about howthey were<br> going to cook us.<br> Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit<br> on us one by one, squash us into jelly.<br> They spent so much time arguing<br> the whithertos and the whyfors...<br> ...that the sun's first light<br> crept over the top of the trees...<br> ...and turned them all to stone!<br> Quickly.<br> Up they go!<br> No, the big one.<br> -Done!<br> -You're supposed to stick it in the ground.<br> -It is in the ground.<br> -Outside!<br> This was your idea.<br> Watch out for the dragon!<br> Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon<br> in these parts for a thousand years.<br> -That was good.<br> -Let's get another one.<br> Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.<br> I might've known.<br> Speech, Bilbo!<br> Speech!<br> Speech!<br> My dear Bagginses and Boffins...<br> ...Tooks and Brandybucks...<br> ...Grubbs, Chubbs...<br> ...Hornblowers...<br> ...Bolgers...<br> ...Bracegirdles...<br> -...and Proudfoots.<br> -Proudfeet!<br> Today is my 111th birthday!<br> Happy birthday!<br> But alas, eleventy-one years is<br> far too short a time to live among...<br> ...such excellent<br> and admirable Hobbits.<br> I don't know half of you<br> half as well as I should like...<br> ...and I like less than half of you<br> half as well as you deserve.<br> I have things to do.<br> I've put this off far too long.<br> I regret to announce this is the end!<br> I'm going now.<br> I bid you all a very fond farewell.<br> Goodbye.<br> I suppose you think<br> that was terribly clever.<br> Come on, Gandalf.<br> Did you see their faces?<br> There are many magic rings in this world,<br> and none of them should be used lightly.<br> It was just a bit of fun.<br> Oh, you're probably right, as usual.<br> -You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?<br> -Two eyes.<br> As often as I can spare them.<br> -I'm leaving everything to him.<br> -What about this ring of yours?<br> -Is that staying too?<br> -Yes, yes.<br> It's in an envelope over there<br> on the mantelpiece.<br> No. Wait, it's...<br> ...here in my pocket.<br> Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?<br> Yet, after all, why not?<br> -Why shouldn't I keep it?<br> -I think you should leave the ring behind.<br> Is that so hard?<br> Well, no.<br> And yes.<br> Now it comes to it,<br> I don't feel like parting with it.<br> It's mine. I found it! It came to me!<br> -There's no need to get angry.<br> -Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!<br> It's mine.<br> My own.<br> -My precious.<br> -Precious?<br> It's been called that before,<br> but not by you.<br> What business is it of yours<br> what I do with my own things?<br> I think you've had that ring<br> quite long enough.<br> -You want it for yourself!<br> -Bilbo Baggins!<br> Do not take me for some conjurer<br> of cheap tricks.<br> I am not trying to rob you.<br> I'm trying to help you.<br> All your long years,<br> we've been friends.<br> Trust me as you once did.<br> Let it go.<br> You're right, Gandalf.<br> The ring must go to Frodo.<br> It's late. The road is long.<br> Yes, it is time.<br> The ring is still in your pocket.<br> I've thought up an ending for my book:<br> "And he lived happily ever after<br> to the end of his days."<br> And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.<br> Goodbye, Gandalf.<br> Goodbye, dear Bilbo.<br> The road goes ever on and on<br> Until our next meeting.<br> It's mine. My own.<br> My precious.<br> Riddles in the dark.<br> Bilbo!<br> Bilbo!<br> My precious.<br> Precious.<br> He's gone, hasn't he?<br> He talked for so long about leaving...<br> ...I didn't think he'd really do it.<br> Gandalf?<br> Bilbo's ring.<br> He's gone to stay with the Elves.<br> He's left you Bag End.<br> Along with all his possessions.<br> The ring is yours now.<br> -Put it somewhere out of sight.<br> -Where are you going?<br> -There are some things that I must see to.<br> -What things?<br> -Questions. Questions that need answering.<br> -You've only just arrived.<br> I don't understand.<br> Neither do I.<br> Keep it secret.<br> Keep it safe.<br> Shirel<br> Bagginsl<br> "The year 3434 of the Second Age.<br> Here follows the account of Isildur,<br> High King of Gondor...<br> ...and the finding<br> of the Ring of Power. "<br> It has come to me.<br> The One Ring. It shall be"<br> an heirloom of my kingdom.<br> All those who follow in my bloodline<br> shall be bound to its fate...<br> ...for I will risk<br> no hurt to the Ring.<br> It is precious to me...<br> ...though I buy it with great pain.<br> The markings upon the band<br> begin to fade.<br> The writing, which at first was as clear<br> as red flame, has all but disappeared.<br> A secret now<br> that only fire can tell.<br> Shire.<br> Baggins.<br> There's no Bagginses around here.<br> They're all up in Hobbiton.<br> That way.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> Good night, Sam.<br> Is it secret? Is it safe?<br> What are you doing?<br> Hold out your hand, Frodo.<br> It's quite cool.<br> What can you see?<br> Can you see anything?<br> Nothing.<br> There's nothing.<br> Wait.<br> There are markings.<br> It's some form of Elvish.<br> I can't read it.<br> There are few who can.<br> The language is that of Mordor,<br> which I will not utter here.<br> Mordor!<br> In the common tongue, it says:<br> "One Ring to rule them all...<br> ...One Ring to find them...<br> ...One Ring to bring them all...<br> ...and in the darkness bind them."<br> This is the One Ring...<br> ...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron<br> in the fires of Mount Doom.<br> Taken by Isildur<br> from the hand of Sauron himself.<br> Bilbo found it.<br> -In Gollum's cave.<br> -Yes.<br> For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet<br> in Bilbo's keeping...<br> ...prolonging his life,<br> delaying old age.<br> But no longer, Frodo.<br> Evil is stirring in Mordor.<br> The Ring has awoken.<br> It's heard its master's call.<br> But he was destroyed.<br> Sauron was destroyed.<br> No, Frodo.<br> The spirit of Sauron endured.<br> His life force is bound to the Ring,<br> and the Ring survived.<br> Sauron has returned.<br> His Orcs have multiplied.<br> His fortress at Barad-dr<br> is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.<br> Sauron needs only this Ring to cover<br> all the lands in a second darkness.<br> He is seeking it.<br> Seeking it. All his thought<br> is bent on it.<br> For the Ring yearns above all else...<br> ...to return to the hand<br> of its master.<br> They are one...<br> ...the Ring and the Dark Lord.<br> Frodo...<br> ...he must never find it.<br> All right.<br> We put it away. We keep it hidden.<br> We never speak of it again.<br> No one knows it's here, do they?<br> Do they, Gandalf?<br> There is one other who knew<br> that Bilbo had the Ring.<br> I looked everywhere<br> for the creature Gollum.<br> But the enemy found him first.<br> I don't know how long<br> they tortured him.<br> But amidst the endless screams and<br> inane babble, they discerned two words.:<br> Shire!<br> Baggins!<br> Shire.<br> Baggins. But that would<br> lead them here!<br> Who goes there?<br> Take it, Gandalf!<br> -Take it!<br> -No, Frodo.<br> -You must take it!<br> -You cannot offer me this ring!<br> -I'm giving it to you!<br> -Don't tempt me, Frodo!<br> I dare not take it.<br> Not even to keep it safe.<br> Understand, Frodo...<br> ...I would use this Ring<br> from a desire to do good.<br> But through me, it would wield a power<br> too great and terrible to imagine.<br> -But it cannot stay in the Shire!<br> -No.<br> No, it can't.<br> What must I do?<br> -You must leave. And leave quickly.<br> -Where? Where do I go?<br> Get out of the Shire.<br> Make for the village of Bree.<br> Bree.<br> -What about you?<br> -I'll be waiting for you...<br> ...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.<br> -And the Ring will be safe there?<br> -I don't know, Frodo.<br> I don't have any answers.<br> I must see the head of my order. He is<br> both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.<br> He'll know what to do.<br> You'll have to leave the name<br> of Baggins behind you.<br> That name is not safe<br> outside the Shire.<br> Travel only by day.<br> And stay off the road.<br> I can cut across country<br> easily enough.<br> My dear Frodo.<br> Hobbits really are amazing creatures.<br> You can learn all that there is to<br> know about their ways in a month.<br> And yet, after a hundred years...<br> ...they can still surprise you.<br> Get down.<br> Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!<br> Have you been eavesdropping?<br> I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.<br> I was cutting the grass under the window.<br> A little late for trimming the verge,<br> don't you think?<br> -I heard raised voices.<br> -What did you hear? Speak!<br> Nothing important.<br> That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,<br> a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--<br> Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.<br> Don't turn me into anything unnatural.<br> No?<br> Perhaps not.<br> I've thought of a better use for you.<br> Come along, Samwise. Keep up.<br> Be careful, both of you.<br> The enemy has many spies<br> in his service:<br> Birds, beasts.<br> Is it safe?<br> Never put it on...<br> ...for the agents of the Dark Lord<br> will be drawn to its power.<br> Always remember, Frodo...<br> ...the Ring is trying to get back<br> to its master.<br> It wants to be found.<br> This is it.<br> This is what?<br> If I take one more step...<br> ...it'll be the farthest away<br> from home I've ever been.<br> Come on, Sam.<br> Remember what Bilbo used to say:<br> -"It's a dangerous business, Frodo."<br> -"Going out your door.<br> You step onto the road,<br> and if you don't keep your feet...<br> ...there's no knowing where<br> you might be swept off to. "<br> Smoke rises<br> from the Mountain of Doom.<br> The hour grows late.<br> And Gandalf the Grey<br> rides to Isengard...<br> ...seeking my counsel.<br> For that is why you have come,<br> is it not?<br> My old friend.<br> Saruman.<br> -You are sure of this?<br> -Beyond any doubt.<br> So the Ring of Power has been found.<br> All these long years,<br> it was in the Shire.<br> -Under my very nose.<br> -Yet you did not have the wit to see it.<br> Your love of the halfling's leaf<br> has clearly slowed your mind.<br> But we still have time. Time enough<br> to counter Sauron if we act quickly.<br> Time?<br> What time do you think we have?<br> Sauron has regained<br> much of his former strength.<br> He cannot yet take physical form...<br> ...but his spirit has lost<br> none of its potency.<br> Concealed within his fortress,<br> the Lord of Mordor sees all.<br> His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,<br> earth and flesh.<br> You know of what I speak, Gandalf.<br> A Great Eye, lidless,<br> wreathed in flame.<br> The Eye of Sauron.<br> He is gathering all evil to him.<br> Very soon, he'll have summoned an army<br> great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.<br> You knowthis?<br> How?<br> I have seen it.<br> A palantr is a dangerous tool,<br> Saruman.<br> Why?<br> Why should we fear to use it?<br> They are not all accounted for,<br> the lost Seeing-stones.<br> We do not know who else<br> may be watching.<br> The hour is later than you think.<br> Sauron's forces are already moving.<br> The Nine have left Minas Morgul.<br> The Nine?<br> They crossed the River Isen<br> on Midsummer's Eve...<br> ...disguised as riders in black.<br> -They've reached the Shire?<br> -They will find the Ring.<br> And kill the one who carries it.<br> Frodo!<br> You did not seriously think that a Hobbit<br> could contend with the will of Sauron?<br> There are none who can.<br> Against the power of Mordor...<br> ...there can be no victory.<br> We must join with him, Gandalf.<br> We must join with Sauron.<br> It would be wise, my friend.<br> Tell me...<br> ...friend...<br> ...when did Saruman the Wise<br> abandon reason for madness?<br> I gave you the chance...<br> ...of aiding me willingly...<br> ...but you have elected<br> the way of pain!<br> Mr. Frodo?<br> Frodo? Frodo!<br> -I thought I'd lost you.<br> -What are you talking about?<br> -It's just something Gandalf said.<br> -What did he say?<br> "Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."<br> And I don't mean to.<br> Sam, we're still in the Shire.<br> What could possibly happen?<br> Frodo.<br> -Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.<br> -Hello, Frodo.<br> Get off him.<br> Come on, Frodo.<br> What's the meaning of this?<br> You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!<br> You get back here!<br> Get out of my field!<br> You know what's gonna happen<br> when I catch up with you?<br> I don't know why he's so upset.<br> It's only a couple of carrots.<br> And some cabbages.<br> And those three bags of potatoes<br> that we lifted last week.<br> -And then the mushrooms the week before.<br> -Yes, Pippin. My point is...<br> ...he's clearly overreacting.<br> Run!<br> Oh, that was close.<br> I think I've broken something.<br> Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!<br> What? That was just a detour.<br> A shortcut.<br> -Shortcut to what?<br> -Mushrooms!<br> That's mine.<br> That's nice, Merry.<br> Here's a nice one, Sam.<br> I think we should get off the road.<br> Get off the road!<br> Quick!<br> Be quiet!<br> What was that?<br> Anything?<br> Nothing.<br> What is going on?<br> That Black Rider was looking<br> for something. Or someone.<br> Get down!<br> I have to leave the Shire.<br> Sam and I must get to Bree.<br> Right.<br> Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.<br> Run!<br> This way! Follow me!<br> Run!<br> Get the rope, Sam!<br> Frodo!<br> Run, Frodo!<br> Go!<br> -Hurry!<br> Frodo, come on!<br> -Come on! Faster!<br> -Jump!<br> -Howfar to the nearest crossing?<br> -The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.<br> Come on.<br> -What do you want?<br> -We're heading for the Prancing Pony.<br> Hobbits. Four Hobbits!<br> -What business brings you to Bree?<br> -We wish to stay at the inn.<br> Our business is our own.<br> All right, young sir.<br> I meant no offense.<br> It's my job to ask questions<br> after nightfall.<br> There's talk of strange folk abroad.<br> Can't be too careful.<br> Out of the way!<br> Watch where you're walking.<br> Excuse me.<br> Good evening, little masters.<br> If you're seeking accommodation, we got<br> some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.<br> Mister...?<br> Underhill. My name's Underhill.<br> -Underhill, yes.<br> -We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.<br> -Can you tell him we've arrived?<br> -Gandalf?<br> Gandalf.<br> Oh, yes...<br> ...I remember. Elderly chap.<br> Big grey beard, pointy hat.<br> Not seen him for six months.<br> What do we do now?<br> Sam...<br> ...he'll be here. He'll come.<br> Get out of my way!<br> What's that?<br> This, my friend, is a pint.<br> It comes in pints?<br> -I'm getting one.<br> -You got a whole half already!<br> That fellow's done nothing<br> but stare at you since we arrived.<br> Excuse me.<br> That Man in the corner. Who is he?<br> He's one of them Rangers. They're<br> dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.<br> What his right name is, I've never heard,<br> but around here he's known as Strider.<br> Strider.<br> Baggins.<br> Baggins.<br> Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.<br> He's over there. Frodo Baggins.<br> He's my second cousin,<br> once removed on his mother's side...<br> ...and my third cousin, twice removed....<br> -Pippin!<br> -Steady on, Frodo.<br> You cannot hide.<br> I see you.<br> There is no life...<br> ...in the void.<br> Only...<br> ...death.<br> You drawfar too much attention<br> to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."<br> What do you want?<br> A little more caution from you.<br> That is no trinket you carry.<br> -I carry nothing.<br> -Indeed.<br> I can avoid being seen if I wish...<br> ...but to disappear entirely,<br> that is a rare gift.<br> -Who are you?<br> -Are you frightened?<br> Yes.<br> Not nearly frightened enough.<br> I know what hunts you.<br> Let him go!<br> Or I'll have you, Longshanks.<br> You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.<br> But that will not save you.<br> You can no longer wait<br> for the wizard, Frodo.<br> They're coming.<br> What are they?<br> They were once Men.<br> Great kings of Men.<br> Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them<br> nine rings of power.<br> Blinded by their greed,<br> they took them without question.<br> One by one, falling into darkness.<br> Nowthey are slaves to his will.<br> They are the NazgI.<br> Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.<br> At all times they feel...<br> ...the presence of the Ring...<br> "...drawn to the power of the" One."<br> They will never stop hunting you.<br> -Where are you taking us?<br> -Into the Wild.<br> How do we knowthis Strider<br> is a friend of Gandalf?<br> We have no choice but to trust him.<br> -But where is he leading us?<br> -To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.<br> -To the house of Elrond.<br> -Did you hear that? Rivendell.<br> We're going to see the Elves.<br> -Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.<br> -What about breakfast?<br> -You've already had it.<br> -We've had one, yes.<br> What about second breakfast?<br> Don't think he knows<br> about second breakfast, Pip.<br> What about elevenses? Luncheon?<br> Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?<br> -He knows about them, doesn't he?<br> -I wouldn't count on it.<br> Pippin!<br> The power of Isengard<br> is at your command...<br> ...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.<br> Build me an army worthy of Mordor.<br> What orders from Mordor, my lord?<br> What does the Eye command?<br> We have work to do.<br> The trees are strong, my lord.<br> Their roots go deep.<br> Rip them all down.<br> This was the great watchtower<br> of Amon SI.<br> We shall rest here tonight.<br> These are for you.<br> Keep them close.<br> I'm going to have a look around.<br> Stay here.<br> My tomato's burst.<br> Could I have some bacon?<br> Want a tomato, Sam?<br> -What are you doing?!<br> -Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.<br> -We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.<br> -Put it out, you fools!<br> -Put it out!<br> -That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!<br> Go!<br> Back, you devils!<br> Frodo!<br> Oh, Sam.<br> Strider!<br> -Help him, Strider.<br> -He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.<br> This is beyond my skill to heal.<br> He needs Elvish medicine.<br> Hurry!<br> We're six days from Rivendell!<br> He'll never make it!<br> Hold on, Frodo.<br> Gandalf!<br> Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.<br> Is he going to die?<br> He's passing into the Shadow World.<br> He'll soon become a Wraith like them.<br> -They're close.<br> -Sam, do you knowthe Athelas plant?<br> -Athelas?<br> -Kingsfoil.<br> Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.<br> It may help to slowthe poisoning.<br> Hurry!<br> What's this?<br> A Ranger caught off his guard?<br> Frodo.<br> I am Arwen - I've come to help you.<br> Hear my voice...<br> Come back to the light.<br> Who is she?<br> Frodo.<br> -She's an Elf.<br> -He's fading.<br> He's not going to last.<br> We must get him to my father.<br> -I've been looking for you for two days.<br> -Where are you taking him?<br> There are five Wraiths behind you.<br> Where the other four are, I do not know.<br> Stay with the Hobbits -<br> I'll send horses for you.<br> I'm the faster rider - I'll take him.<br> The Road is too dangerous.<br> What are they saying?<br> If I can get across the river...<br> ...the power of my people<br> will protect him.<br> I do not fear them.<br> Arwen...<br> ...ride hard. Don't look back.<br> What are you doing?!<br> Those Wraiths are still out there!<br> Give up the halfling, She-Elf.<br> If you want him, come and claim him.<br> No. No!<br> Frodo, no.<br> Frodo, don't give in.<br> Not now.<br> What grace is given me...<br> ...let it pass to him.<br> Let him be spared.<br> Save him.<br> -Where am I?<br> -You are in the house of Elrond.<br> And it is 10:00 in the morning<br> on October 24th, if you want to know.<br> -Gandalf!<br> -Yes, I'm here.<br> And you're lucky to be here too.<br> A few more hours and you<br> would have been beyond our aid.<br> But you have some strength in you,<br> my dear Hobbit.<br> What happened, Gandalf?<br> -Why didn't you meet us?<br> -I am sorry, Frodo.<br> I was delayed.<br> A friendship with Saruman<br> is not lightly thrown aside.<br> One ill turn deserves another.<br> It is over.<br> Embrace the power of the Ring...<br> ...or embrace your own destruction!<br> There is only one Lord of the Ring.<br> Only one who can bend it to his will.<br> And he does not share power.<br> So you have chosen death.<br> Gandalf? What is it?<br> Nothing, Frodo.<br> Frodo!<br> -Sam.<br> -Bless you, you're awake!<br> Sam has hardly left your side.<br> We were that worried about you.<br> Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?<br> By the skills of Lord Elrond,<br> you're beginning to mend.<br> Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.<br> -Bilbo!<br> -Hello, Frodo, my lad.<br> Bilbo.<br> "There and Back Again:<br> A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."<br> -This is wonderful.<br> -I meant to go back...<br> ...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...<br> ...visit Lake-town...<br> ...see the Lonely Mountain again.<br> But age, it seems,<br> has finally caught up with me.<br> I miss the Shire.<br> I spent all my childhood pretending<br> I was off somewhere else.<br> Off with you,<br> on one of your adventures.<br> But my own adventure turned out<br> to be quite different.<br> I'm not like you, Bilbo.<br> My dear boy.<br> -Now, what have I forgotten?<br> -Packed already?<br> No harm in being prepared.<br> -I thought you wanted to see the Elves.<br> -I do.<br> -More than anything.<br> -I did.<br> It's just....<br> We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?<br> We got the Ring this far,<br> to Rivendell. And I thought...<br> ...seeing as how you're on the mend,<br> we'd be off soon.<br> Off home.<br> You are right, Sam.<br> We did what we set out to do.<br> The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.<br> I am ready to go home.<br> His strength returns.<br> That wound will never fully heal.<br> He will carry it the rest of his life.<br> And yet to have come so far<br> still bearing the Ring...<br> ...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary<br> resilience to its evil.<br> It is a burden he should never<br> have had to bear.<br> -We can ask no more of Frodo.<br> -Gandalf, the enemy is moving.<br> Sauron's forces are massing in the East.<br> His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.<br> And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.<br> Our list of allies grows thin.<br> His treachery runs deeper<br> than you know.<br> By foul craft, Saruman<br> has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.<br> He's breeding an army<br> in the caverns of Isengard.<br> An army that can move in sunlight<br> and cover great distance at speed.<br> Saruman is coming for the Ring.<br> This evil cannot be concealed<br> by the power of the Elves.<br> We do not have the strength<br> to fight both Mordor and Isengard!<br> Gandalf...<br> ...the Ring cannot stay here.<br> This peril belongs<br> to all Middle-earth.<br> They must decide now how to end it.<br> The time of the Elves is over.<br> My people are leaving these shores.<br> Who will you look to when we've gone?<br> The Dwarves?<br> They hide in mountains seeking riches.<br> They care not for the troubles of others.<br> It is in Men<br> that we must place our hope.<br> Men?<br> Men are weak.<br> The race of Men is failing.<br> The blood of Nmenor is all but spent,<br> its pride and dignity forgotten.<br> It is because of Men<br> the Ring survives.<br> I was there, Gandalf.<br> I was there 3000 years ago...<br> ...when Isildur took the Ring.<br> I was there the day<br> the strength of Men failed.<br> Isildur, hurry! Follow me.<br> I led Isildur into the heart<br> of Mount Doom...<br> ...where the Ring was forged,<br> the one place it could be destroyed.<br> Cast it into the fire!<br> -Destroy it!<br> -No.<br> Isildur!<br> It should have ended that day,<br> but evil was allowed to endure.<br> Isildur kept the Ring.<br> The line of kings is broken.<br> There's no strength left<br> in the world of Men.<br> -They're scattered, divided, leaderless.<br> -There is one who could unite them.<br> One who could reclaim<br> the throne of Gondor.<br> He turned from that path<br> a long time ago.<br> He has chosen exile.<br> The shards of Narsil.<br> The blade that cut the Ring<br> from Sauron's hand.<br> It's still sharp.<br> But no more than a broken heirloom.<br> Why do you fear the past?<br> You are Isildur's heir,<br> not Isildur himself.<br> You are not bound to his fate.<br> The same blood flows in my veins.<br> The same weakness.<br> Your time will come.<br> You will face the same evil.<br> And you will defeat it.<br> The Shadow does not hold sway yet.<br> Not over you... not over me.<br> Do you remember when we first met?<br> I thought I had strayed into a dream.<br> Long years have passed.<br> You did not have the cares<br> you carry now.<br> Do you remember what I told you?<br> You said you'd bind yourself to me...<br> ...forsaking the immortal life<br> of your people.<br> And to that I hold.<br> I would rather share<br> one lifetime with you...<br> ...than face all the Ages<br> of this world alone.<br> I choose a mortal life.<br> -You cannot give me this.<br> -It is mine to give to whom I will...<br> ...like my heart.<br> Strangers from distant lands,<br> friends of old...<br> ...you've been summoned here<br> to answer the threat of Mordor.<br> Middle-earth stands upon the brink<br> of destruction. None can escape it.<br> You will unite, or you will fall.<br> Each race is bound to this fate,<br> this one doom.<br> Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.<br> So it is true.<br> -The doom of Man.<br> -It is a gift.<br> A gift to the foes of Mordor.<br> Why not use this Ring?<br> Long has my father,<br> the Steward of Gondor...<br> ...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.<br> By the blood of our people...<br> ...are your lands kept safe.<br> Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.<br> Let us use it against him.<br> You cannot wield it.<br> None of us can.<br> The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.<br> It has no other master.<br> And what would a Ranger know<br> of this matter?<br> This is no mere Ranger.<br> He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.<br> You owe him your allegiance.<br> Aragorn.<br> This is Isildur's heir?<br> And heir to the throne of Gondor.<br> Sit down, Legolas.<br> Gondor has no king.<br> Gondor needs no king.<br> Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.<br> You have only one choice.<br> The Ring must be destroyed.<br> What are we waiting for?<br> The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,<br> son of Glin...<br> ...by any craft that we here possess.<br> The Ring was made in the fires<br> of Mount Doom.<br> Only there can it be unmade.<br> It must be taken deep into Mordor...<br> ...and cast back into the fiery chasm<br> from whence it came.<br> One of you...<br> ...must do this.<br> One does not simply walk into Mordor.<br> Its Black Gates are guarded<br> by more than just Orcs.<br> There is evil there<br> that does not sleep.<br> The Great Eye is ever-watchful.<br> It is a barren wasteland...<br> ...riddled with fire, and ash<br> and dust.<br> The very air you breathe<br> is a poisonous fume.<br> Not with 10,000 men<br> could you do this. It is folly.<br> Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond<br> has said? The Ring must be destroyed.<br> And I suppose you think<br> you are the one to do it!<br> And if we fail, what then? What happens<br> when Sauron takes back what is his?<br> I will be dead before I see the Ring<br> in the hands of an Elf!<br> Never trust an Elf!<br> Do you not understand? While you bicker<br> amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!<br> None can escape it!<br> You'll all be destroyed!<br> I will take it.<br> I will take it.<br> I will take the Ring to Mordor.<br> Though...<br> ...I do not knowthe way.<br> I will help you bear<br> this burden, Frodo Baggins...<br> ...as long as it is yours to bear.<br> If by my life<br> or death I can protect you...<br> ...I will.<br> You have my sword.<br> And you have my bow.<br> And my ax.<br> You carry the fates<br> of us all, little one.<br> If this is indeed<br> the will of the Council...<br> ...then Gondor will see it done.<br> -Frodo's not going anywhere without me.<br> -It is hardly possible to separate you...<br> ...even when he is summoned<br> to a secret Council and you are not.<br> We're coming too!<br> You'll have to send us home<br> tied up in a sack to stop us.<br> Anyway, you need people<br> of intelligence on this sort of...<br> ...mission.<br> Quest.<br> Thing.<br> Well, that rules you out, Pip.<br> Nine companions.<br> So be it.<br> You shall be<br> the Fellowship of the Ring.<br> Great!<br> Where are we going?<br> My old swordl<br> Sting.<br> Here, take it. Take it.<br> -It's so light.<br> -Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.<br> The blade glows blue<br> when Orcs are close.<br> And it's times like that, my lad,<br> when you have to be extra careful.<br> Here's a pretty thing.<br> Mithril.<br> As light as a feather,<br> and as hard as dragon scales.<br> Let me see you put it on. Come on.<br> My old ring.<br> I should very much like...<br> ...to hold it again, one last time.<br> I'm sorry I brought this upon you,<br> my boy.<br> I'm sorry that you<br> must carry this burden.<br> I'm sorry for everything.<br> We must hold to this course, west<br> of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.<br> If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan<br> will still be open to us.<br> From there, our road<br> turns east to Mordor.<br> Two, one, five. Good! Very good.<br> Move your feet.<br> -You look good, Pippin.<br> -Thanks.<br> Faster!<br> If anyone was to ask for my opinion,<br> which I note they're not...<br> ...I'd say we were taking<br> the long way 'round.<br> Gandalf, we could pass through<br> the Mines of Moria.<br> My cousin Balin would give us<br> a royal welcome.<br> No, I would not take the road through<br> Moria unless I had no other choice.<br> Sorry!<br> Get him!<br> -For the Shire!<br> -Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!<br> You've got my arm!<br> You've got my arm!<br> -What is that?<br> -Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.<br> It's moving fast.<br> Against the wind.<br> -Crebain from Dunland!<br> -Hide!<br> -Hurry!<br> -Take cover!<br> Spies of Saruman.<br> The passage south is being watched.<br> We must take the Pass of Caradhras.<br> Frodo!<br> Boromir.<br> It is a strange fate that we should<br> suffer so much fear and doubt...<br> ...over so small a thing.<br> Such a little thing.<br> Boromir!<br> Give the Ring to Frodo.<br> As you wish.<br> I care not.<br> So, Gandalf, you tried<br> to lead them over Caradhras.<br> And if that fails,<br> where then will you go?<br> If the mountain defeats you...<br> ...will you risk<br> a more dangerous road?<br> There is a fell voice on the air.<br> It's Saruman!<br> He's trying to bring down the mountain!<br> Gandalf, we must turn back!<br> No!<br> We must get off the mountain!<br> Make for the Gap of Rohan,<br> and take the west road to my city!<br> The Gap of Rohan takes us<br> too close to Isengard!<br> We cannot pass over a mountain.<br> Let us go under it.<br> Let us go through the Mines of Moria.<br> Moria. You fear to go<br> into those mines.<br> The Dwarves delved too greedily<br> and too deep.<br> You know what they awoke<br> in the darkness of Khazad-dm.:<br> Shadow and flame.<br> Let the Ring-bearer decide.<br> Frodo?<br> We will go through the mines.<br> So be it.<br> The walls...<br> ...of Moria.<br> Well, let's see.<br> Ithildin.<br> It mirrors only starlight<br> and moonlight.<br> It reads, "The Doors of Durin,<br> Lord of Moria.<br> -Speak, friend, and enter."<br> -What do you suppose that means?<br> It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak<br> the password and the doors will open.<br> Mines are no place for a pony.<br> -Even one so brave as Bill.<br> -Bye-bye, Bill.<br> Go on, Bill. Go on.<br> Don't worry, Sam,<br> he knows the way home.<br> Do not disturb the water.<br> Oh, it's useless.<br> It's a riddle.<br> "Speak 'friend' and enter."<br> What's the Elvish word for "friend"?<br> Mellon.<br> Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy<br> the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.<br> Roaring fires, malt beer,<br> ripe meat off the bone!<br> This, my friend,<br> is the home of my cousin Balin.<br> And they call it a mine.<br> A mine!<br> This is no mine. It's a tomb.<br> NO....<br> No!<br> Goblins.<br> We make for the Gap of Rohan.<br> We should never have come here.<br> Now, get out of here.

It's a four-day journey<br> to the other side.<br> Let us hope that our presence<br> may go unnoticed.<br> Pippin.<br> I have no memory of this place.<br> -Are we lost?<br> -No.<br> -I think we are.<br> -Gandalf's thinking.<br> -Merry?<br> -What?<br> I'm hungry.<br> -There's something down there.<br> -It's Gollum.<br> -Gollum?<br> -He's been following us for three days.<br> -He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dr?<br> -Escaped...<br> ...or was set loose.<br> He hates and loves the Ring,<br> as he hates and loves himself.<br> He will never be rid of his need for it.<br> It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him<br> when he had the chance.<br> Pity?<br> It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.<br> Many that live deserve death.<br> Some that die deserve life.<br> Can you give it to them, Frodo?<br> Do not be too eager<br> to deal out death and judgment.<br> Even the very wise<br> cannot see all ends.<br> My heart tells me that Gollum has some<br> part to play yet, for good or ill...<br> ...before this is over.<br> The pity of Bilbo<br> may rule the fate of many.<br> I wish the Ring<br> had never come to me.<br> I wish none of this had happened.<br> So do all who live to see such times.<br> But that is not for them to decide.<br> All we have to decide is what to do<br> with the time that is given to us.<br> There are other forces at work in this<br> world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.<br> Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.<br> In which case,<br> you also were meant to have it.<br> And that is an encouraging thought.<br> It's that way.<br> -He's remembered.<br> -No.<br> But the air doesn't smell<br> so foul down here.<br> If in doubt, Meriadoc,<br> always follow your nose.<br> Let me risk a little more light.<br> Behold...<br> ...the great realm<br> and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.<br> There's an eye opener, and no mistake.<br> Gimli!<br> No!<br> Oh, no.<br> No.<br> "Here lies Balin...<br> ...son of Fundin...<br> ...Lord of Moria."<br> He is dead, then.<br> It's as I feared.<br> We must move on.

No!<br> -Gandalf!<br> Fly, you fools!<br> No!<br> Aragorn!<br> Legolas, get them up.<br> Give them a moment, for pity's sake!<br> By nightfall, these hills will<br> be swarming with Orcs.<br> We must reach the woods of Lothlrien.<br> Come, Boromir. Legolas.<br> Gimli, get them up.<br> On your feet, Sam.<br> Frodo?<br> Frodo!<br> Stay close, young Hobbits!<br> They say that a great sorceress<br> lives in these woods.<br> An Elf-witch...<br> ...of terrible power.<br> All who look upon her...<br> ...fall under her spell.<br> Frodol<br> And are never seen again.<br> Your coming to us is<br> as the footsteps of doom.<br> You bring great evil here,<br> Ring-bearer.<br> Mr. Frodo?<br> Well, here's one Dwarf<br> she won't ensnare so easily.<br> I have the eyes of a hawk<br> and the ears of a fox.<br> The Dwarf breathes so loud,<br> we could have shot him in the dark.<br> Haldir of Lorien.<br> We come here for help.<br> We need your protection.<br> Aragorn, these woods are perilous.<br> We should go back.<br> You have entered the realm of the Lady<br> of the Wood.
