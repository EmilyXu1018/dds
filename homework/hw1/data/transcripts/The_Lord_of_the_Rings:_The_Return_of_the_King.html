The Key of Orthanc.<br> Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dr itself...<br> ...along with the crowns of the seven kings<br> and the rods of the Five Wizards!<br> Your treachery has already cost<br> many lives.<br> Thousands more are now at risk.<br> But you could save them, Saruman.<br> You were deep in the enemy's counsel.<br> So you have come here for information.<br> I have some for you.<br> Something festers<br> in the heart of Middle-earth.<br> Something that you have failed to see.<br> But the Great Eye has seen it.<br> Even now he presses his advantage.<br> His attack will come soon.<br> You're all going to die.<br> But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?<br> You cannot think that this Ranger<br> will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.<br> This exile, crept from the shadows,<br> will never be crowned king.<br> Gandalf does not hesitate<br> to sacrifice those closest to him...<br> ...those he professes to love.<br> Tell me, what words of comfort<br> did you give the Halfling...<br> ...before you sent him to his doom?<br> The path that you have set him on<br> can only lead to death.<br> I've heard enough!<br> Shoot him.<br> Stick an arrow in his gob.<br> No.<br> Come down, Saruman...<br> ...and your life will be spared.<br> - Save your pity and your mercy.<br> I have no use for it!<br> Saruman...<br> ...your staff is broken.<br> Grima, you need not follow him.<br> You were not always as you are now.<br> You were once a Man of Rohan.<br> Come down.<br> A Man of Rohan?<br> What is the house of Rohan...<br> ...but a thatched barn<br> where brigands drink in the reek...<br> ...and their brats roll on the floor<br> with the dogs?<br> The victory at Helm's Deep does not<br> belong to you, Thoden Horse-master.<br> You are a lesser son of greater sires.<br> Grima...<br> ...come down.<br> Be free of him.<br> - Free? He will never be free.<br> - No.<br> Get down, cur!<br> Saruman!<br> You were deep in the enemy's counsel.<br> Tell us what you know!<br> You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you<br> where your doom will be decided.<br> I will not be held prisoner here.<br> Send word to all our allies...<br> ...and to every corner of Middle-earth<br> that still stands free.<br> The enemy moves against us.<br> We need to know where he will strike.<br> The filth of Saruman...<br> ...is washing away.<br> Trees will come back to live here.<br> Young trees.<br> - Wild trees.<br> - Pippin!<br> Bless my bark!<br> Peregrin Took!<br> I'll take that, my lad.<br> Quickly, now.<br> Tonight we remember those who<br> gave their blood to defend this country.<br> Hail the victorious dead.<br> Hail!<br> No pauses.<br> - No spills.<br> - And no regurgitation.<br> So it's a drinking game?<br> Last one standing wins.<br> What'll we drink to?<br> Let's drink to victory!<br> To victory!<br> I am happy for you.<br> He is an honorable man.<br> You are both honorable men.<br> It was not Thoden of Rohan<br> who led our people to victory.<br> Don't listen to me.<br> You are young.<br> And tonight is for you.<br> Here, here.<br> It's the Dwarves that go swimming<br> with little, hairy women.<br> I feel something.<br> A slight tingle in my fingers.<br> I think it's affecting me.<br> What did I say?<br> He can't hold his liquor.<br> Game over.<br> Oh, you can search far and wide<br> You can drink the whole town dry<br> But you'll never find a beer so brown<br> But you'll never find a beer so brown<br> As the one we drink in our hometown<br> As the one we drink in our hometown<br> You can drink your fancy ales<br> You can drink 'em by the flagon<br> But the only brew for the brave and true<br> Pippin!<br> But the only brew for the brave and true<br> Comes from The Green Dragon<br> Thank you! I win!<br> No news of Frodo?<br> No word. Nothing.<br> We have time.<br> Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.<br> Do we know that?<br> What does your heart tell you?<br> That Frodo is alive.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, he's alive.<br> Too risky. Too risky.<br> Thieves.<br> They stole it from us.<br> Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.<br> Quiet! Mustn't wake them.<br> Mustn't ruin it now.<br> But they knows.<br> They knows.<br> They suspects us.<br> What's it saying, my precious, my love?<br> Is Smagol losing his nerve?<br> No. Not.<br> Never. Smagol hates nasty Hobbitses.<br> Smagol wants to see them dead.<br> And we will.<br> Smagol did it once.<br> He can do it again.<br> It's ours!<br> Ours!<br> We must get the precious.<br> We must get it back.<br> Patience! Patience, my love.<br> First we must lead them to her.<br> We lead them to the Winding Stair.<br> Yes, the stairs. And then?<br> Up, up, up, up,<br> up the stairs we go...<br> ...until we come to the tunnel.<br> And when they go in...<br> ...there's no coming out.<br> She's always hungry.<br> She always needs to feed.<br> She must eat.<br> All she gets is filthy Orcses.<br> And they doesn't taste very nice,<br> does they, precious?<br> No.<br> Not very nice at all, my love.<br> She hungers for sweeter meats.<br> Hobbit meat.<br> And when she throws away the bones<br> and the empty clothes...<br> ...then we will find it.<br> And take it for me!<br> For us.<br> Yes. We meant "for us."<br> Gollum. Gollum.<br> The precious will be ours...<br> ...once the Hobbitses are dead!<br> You treacherous little toad!<br> No! No! Master!<br> No, Sam! Leave him alone!<br> I heard it from his own mouth.<br> He means to murder us.<br> Never! Smagol wouldn't hurt a fly.<br> He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...<br> ...who hates Smagol...<br> ...and who makes up nasty lies.<br> You miserable little maggot!<br> I'll stove your head in!<br> Sam!<br> Call me a liar? You're a liar!<br> - You scare him off, we're lost!<br> - I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.<br> - I won't wait around for him to kill us!<br> - I'm not sending him away.<br> You don't see it, do you?<br> He's a villain.<br> We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.<br> Not without a guide.<br> I need you on my side.<br> I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.<br> I know, Sam. I know.<br> Trust me.<br> Come, Smagol.<br> What time is it?<br> Not yet dawn.<br> I dreamed I saw a great wave...<br> ...climbing over green lands<br> and above the hills.<br> I stood upon the brink.<br> It was utterly dark in the abyss<br> before my feet.<br> A light shone behind me...<br> ...but I could not turn.<br> I could only stand there, waiting.<br> Night changes many thoughts.<br> Sleep, owyn.<br> Sleep...<br> ...while you can.<br> The stars are veiled.<br> Something stirs in the east.<br> A sleepless malice.<br> The Eye of the enemy is moving.<br> What are you doing?<br> Pippin!<br> Pippin?<br> Pippin.<br> - What, are you mad?<br> - I just want to look at it.<br> Just one more time.<br> Put it back.<br> Pippin.<br> No!<br> Pippin.<br> He is here.<br> I see you.<br> Pippin!<br> Help! Gandalf, help!<br> Someone help him!<br> Pippin!<br> Fool of a Took!<br> Look at me.<br> Gandalf, forgive me.<br> Look at me.<br> What did you see?<br> A tree.<br> There was a white tree...<br> ...in a courtyard of stone.<br> It was dead.<br> The city was burning.<br> Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?<br> I saw...<br> I saw him.<br> I could hear his voice in my head.<br> And what did you tell him?<br> Speak!<br> He asked me my name.<br> I didn't answer.<br> He hurt me.<br> What did you tell him<br> about Frodo and the Ring?<br> There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.<br> A fool...<br> ...but an honest fool he remains.<br> He told Sauron nothing<br> of Frodo and the Ring.<br> We've been strangely fortunate.<br> Pippin saw in the palantir<br> a glimpse of the enemy's plan.<br> Sauron moves to strike<br> the city of Minas Tirith.<br> His defeat at Helm's Deep<br> showed our enemy one thing.<br> He knows the heir of Elendil<br> has come forth.<br> Men are not as weak as he supposed.<br> There is courage still, strength<br> enough perhaps to challenge him.<br> Sauron fears this.<br> He will not risk the peoples of<br> Middle-earth uniting under one banner.<br> He will raze Minas Tirith<br> to the ground...<br> ...before he sees a king<br> return to the throne of Men.<br> If the beacons of Gondor are lit,<br> Rohan must be ready for war.<br> Tell me...<br> ...why should we ride to the aid<br> of those who did not come to ours?<br> What do we owe Gondor?<br> - I will go.<br> - No!<br> - They must be warned.<br> - They will be.<br> You must come to Minas Tirith<br> by another road.<br> Follow the river.<br> Look to the black ships.<br> Understand this:<br> Things are now in motion<br> that cannot be undone.<br> I ride for Minas Tirith...<br> ...and I won't be going alone.<br> Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,<br> Peregrin Took, you are the worst.<br> Hurry! Hurry!<br> Where are we going?<br> Why did you look?<br> Why do you always have to look?<br> - I don't know. I can't help it.<br> - You never can.<br> I'm sorry, all right?<br> - I won't do it again.<br> - Don't you understand?<br> The enemy thinks you have the Ring.<br> He's going to be looking for you, Pip.<br> They have to get you out of here.<br> And you...? You're coming with me?<br> Merry?<br> Come on.<br> How far is Minas Tirith?<br> Three days' ride, as the Nazgl flies.<br> And you better hope we don't have<br> one of those on our tail.<br> Here.<br> Something for the road.<br> The last of the Longbottom Leaf.<br> I know you've run out.<br> You smoke too much, Pippin.<br> But... But we'll see each other soon.<br> - Won't we?<br> - I don't know.<br> I don't know what's going to happen.<br> - Merry.<br> - Run, Shadowfax.<br> Show us the meaning of haste.<br> Merry!<br> Merry!<br> He's always followed me...<br> ...everywhere I went...<br> ...since before we were tweens.<br> I would get him into<br> the worst sort of trouble...<br> ...but I was always there to get him out.<br> Now he's gone.<br> Just like Frodo and Sam.<br> One thing I have learned about Hobbits:<br> They're a most hardy folk.<br> Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.<br> Take her by the safest road.<br> A ship lies anchored<br> in the Grey Havens.<br> It waits to carry her across the sea.<br> The last journey of Arwen U ndmiel.<br> There is nothing for you here...<br> ...only death.<br> Lady Arwen...<br> ...we cannot delay.<br> My lady!<br> - Tell me what you have seen.<br> - Arwen.<br> You have the gift of foresight.<br> What did you see?<br> I looked into your future,<br> and I saw death.<br> But there is also life.<br> You saw there was a child.<br> You saw my son.<br> That future is almost gone.<br> But it is not lost.<br> Nothing is certain.<br> Some things are certain.<br> If I leave him now...<br> ...I will regret it forever.<br> It is time.<br> From the ashes a fire shall be woken<br> A light from the shadow shall spring<br> Renewed shall be blade that was broken<br> The crownless again shall be king<br> Re-forge the sword.<br> Your hands are cold.<br> The life of the Eldar is leaving you.<br> This was my choice.<br> Whether by your will or not...<br> ...there is no ship now<br> that can bear me hence.<br> We've just passed<br> into the realm of Gondor.<br> Minas Tirith.<br> City of kings.<br> Make way!<br> It's the tree.<br> Gandalf. Gandalf.<br> Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.<br> The tree of the king.<br> Lord Denethor, however,<br> is not king.<br> He is a steward only,<br> a caretaker of the throne.<br> Now listen carefully.<br> Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.<br> To give him news of his beloved son's<br> death would be most unwise.<br> And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.<br> And say nothing of Aragorn either.<br> I n fact, it's better if you<br> don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.<br> Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,<br> lord and steward of Gondor.<br> I come with tidings in this dark hour,<br> and with counsel.<br> Perhaps you come to explain this.<br> Perhaps you come to tell me<br> why my son is dead.<br> Boromir died to save us...<br> ...my kinsman and me.<br> - He fell defending us from many foes.<br> - Pippin.<br> I offer you my service, such as it is...<br> ...in payment of this debt.<br> This is my first command to you.<br> How did you escape<br> and my son did not...<br> ...so mighty a man as he was?<br> The mightiest man<br> may be slain by one arrow...<br> ...and Boromir was pierced by many.<br> Get up.<br> My lord, there will be a time<br> to grieve for Boromir...<br> ...but it is not now.<br> War is coming.<br> The enemy is on your doorstep.<br> As steward, you are charged...<br> ...with the defense of this city.<br> Where are Gondor's armies?<br> You still have friends.<br> You are not alone in this fight.<br> Send word to Thoden of Rohan.<br> Light the beacons.<br> You think you are wise, Mithrandir.<br> Yet for all your subtleties,<br> you have not wisdom.<br> Do you think the eyes<br> of the White Tower are blind?<br> I have seen more than you know.<br> With your left hand you would use me<br> as a shield against Mordor.<br> And with your right<br> you'd seek to supplant me.<br> I know who rides with Thoden of Rohan.<br> Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears<br> of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.<br> And I tell you now, I will not bow<br> to this Ranger from the North...<br> ...last of a ragged house<br> long bereft of lordship.<br> Authority is not given to you<br> to deny the return of the king, steward.<br> The rule of Gondor is mine<br> and no other's.<br> Come.<br> All has turned to vain ambition.<br> He would even use his grief<br> as a cloak.<br> A thousand years<br> this city has stood.<br> Now, at the whim of a madman,<br> it will fall.<br> And the White Tree,<br> the tree of the king...<br> ...will never bloom again.<br> - Why are they still guarding it?<br> - They guard it because they have hope.<br> A faint and fading hope<br> that one day it will flower.<br> That a king will come<br> and this city will be as it once was...<br> ...before it fell into decay.<br> The old wisdom borne out<br> of the West was forsaken.<br> Kings made tombs more splendid<br> than the houses of the living...<br> ...and counted the old names<br> of their descent...<br> ...dearer than the names of their sons.<br> Childless lords sat in aged halls,<br> musing on heraldry...<br> ...or in high, cold towers,<br> asking questions of the stars.<br> And so the people of Gondor<br> fell into ruin.<br> The line of kings failed.<br> The White Tree withered.<br> The rule of Gondor was given over<br> to lesser men.<br> Mordor.<br> Yes, there it lies.<br> This city has dwelt ever<br> in the sight of its shadow.<br> A storm is coming.<br> This is not the weather of the world.<br> This is a device of Sauron's making.<br> A broil of fume<br> he sends ahead of his host.<br> The Orcs of Mordor<br> have no love of daylight...<br> ...so he covers the face of the sun...<br> ...to ease their passage<br> along the road to war.<br> When the Shadow of Mordor<br> reaches this city...<br> ...it will begin.<br> Well...<br> ...Minas Tirith...<br> ...very impressive.<br> - So where are we off to next?<br> - Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.<br> There's no leaving this city.<br> Help must come to us.<br> It must be getting near teatime.<br> Leastways, it would be in decent places<br> where there is still teatime.<br> We're not in decent places.<br> Mr. Frodo?<br> What is it?<br> It's just a feeling.<br> I don't think I'll be coming back.<br> Yes, you will. Of course you will.<br> That's just morbid thinking.<br> We're going there and back again...<br> ...just like Mr. Bilbo.<br> You'll see.<br> I think these lands were once<br> part of the kingdom of Gondor.<br> Long ago, when there was a king.<br> Mr. Frodo, look.<br> The king has got a crown again.<br> Come on, Hobbits!<br> Mustn't stop now. This way.<br> So I imagine this is just<br> a ceremonial position.<br> I mean, they don't actually expect me<br> to do any fighting.<br> - Do they?<br> - You're in the service of the steward now.<br> You'll have to do as you're told,<br> Peregrin Took.<br> Ridiculous Hobbit.<br> Guard of the Citadel.<br> Thank you.<br> There's no more stars.<br> Is it time?<br> Yes.<br> It's so quiet.<br> It's the deep breath before the plunge.<br> I don't want to be in a battle...<br> ...but waiting on the edge of one<br> I can't escape is even worse.<br> Is there any hope, Gandalf,<br> for Frodo and Sam?<br> There never was much hope.<br> Just a fool's hope.<br> Our enemy is ready.<br> His full strength's gathered.<br> Not only Orcs, but Men as well.<br> Legions of Haradrim from the south...<br> ...mercenaries from the coast.<br> All will answer Mordor's call.<br> Come on.<br> This will be the end of Gondor<br> as we know it.<br> Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.<br> If the river is taken,<br> if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...<br> ...the last defense of this city<br> will be gone.<br> But we have the White Wizard.<br> That's got to count for something.<br> Gandalf?<br> Sauron has yet to reveal<br> his deadliest servant...<br> ...the one who will lead<br> Mordor's armies in war.<br> The one they say no living man can kill.<br> The Witch-king of Angmar.<br> You've met him before.<br> He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.<br> He is the lord of the Nazgl...<br> ...the greatest of the Nine.<br> Minas Morgul is his lair.<br> The Dead City.<br> Very nasty place. Full of enemies.<br> Quick. Quick.<br> They will see. They will see.<br> Come away. Come away.<br> Look, we have found it.<br> The way into Mordor.<br> The secret stair.<br> Climb.<br> - No, Mr. Frodo!<br> - Not that way!<br> - What's it doing?<br> - No.<br> - They're calling me.<br> - No.<br> Hide! Hide!<br> I can feel his blade.<br> We come to it at last.<br> The great battle of our time.<br> Come away, Hobbits.<br> We climb. We must climb.<br> The board is set.<br> The pieces are moving.<br> Up, up, up the stairs we go.<br> And then it's into the tunnel.<br> Hey, what's in this tunnel?<br> You listen to me,<br> and you listen good and proper.<br> Anything happens to him,<br> you have me to answer to.<br> One sniff something's not right...<br> ...one hair stands up<br> on the back of my head, it's over.<br> No more slinker. No more stinker.<br> You're gone. Got it?<br> I'm watching you.<br> What was that about?<br> Nothing. Just clearing something up.<br> Peregrin Took, my lad,<br> there is a task now to be done.<br> Another opportunity for one<br> of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.<br> You must not fail me.<br> It's been very quiet across the river.<br> The Orcs are lying low.<br> The garrison may have moved out.<br> We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.<br> If the Orcs attack from the north,<br> we'll have some warning.<br> Quiet.<br> We need 10 more.<br> Kill him!<br> They're not coming from the north.<br> To the river. Quick. Quick.<br> Go. Come on.<br> Faster.<br> Draw swords.<br> Hold! Hold them!<br> What?<br> Amon D n.<br> The beacon.<br> The beacon of Amon D n is lit.<br> Hope is kindled.<br> The beacons of Minas Tirith!<br> The beacons are lit!<br> Gondor calls for aid.<br> And Rohan will answer.<br> Muster the Rohirrim.<br> Assemble the army at Dunharrow.<br> As many men as can be found.<br> You have two days.<br> On the third,<br> we ride for Gondor and war.<br> - Forward.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - Gamling.<br> - My lord.<br> Make haste<br> across the Riddermark.<br> Summon every able-bodied man<br> to Dunharrow.<br> I will.<br> - Will you ride with us?<br> - Just to the encampment.<br> It's tradition for the women<br> of the court to farewell the men.<br> The men have found their captain.<br> They will follow you into battle,<br> even to death.<br> You have given us hope.<br> Excuse me.<br> I have a sword.<br> Please accept it.<br> I offer you my service, Thoden King.<br> And gladly I accept it.<br> You shall be Meriadoc,<br> esquire of Rohan.<br> Horse-Men.<br> I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,<br> fully armed and filthy.<br> Your kinsmen may have no need<br> to ride to war.<br> I fear war already marches<br> on their own lands.<br> So it is before the walls<br> of Minas Tirith...<br> ...the doom of our time will be decided.<br> Now is the hour.<br> Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.<br> Now, fulfill them all.<br> To lord and land!<br> Faramir!<br> We can't hold them. The city is lost.<br> Tell the men to break cover.<br> We ride for Minas Tirith.<br> Nazgl.<br> Take cover!<br> Nazgl!<br> Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!<br> Fall back!<br> - Retreat! Retreat!<br> - Run for your lives!<br> The age of Men is over.<br> The time of the Orc has come.<br> - Keep going.<br> - It's the Nazgl.<br> Take cover, my lord!<br> It's coming!<br> - It's Mithrandir.<br> - The White Rider!<br> Pull!<br> Mithrandir.<br> They broke through our defenses.<br> They've taken the bridge<br> and the west bank.<br> - Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.<br> - It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.<br> - Long has he foreseen this doom.<br> - Foreseen and done nothing.<br> Faramir?<br> This is not the first Halfling<br> to have crossed your path.<br> No.<br> You've seen Frodo and Sam?<br> - Where? When?<br> - I n lthilien.<br> Not two days ago.<br> Gandalf, they're taking the road<br> to the Morgul Vale.<br> And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.<br> What does that mean?<br> - What's wrong?<br> - Faramir, tell me everything.<br> Tell me all you know.<br> This is how you would serve your city?<br> You would risk its utter ruin?<br> I did what I judged to be right.<br> What you judged to be right.<br> You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor<br> in the hands of a witless Halfling.<br> It should have been brought back<br> to the Citadel to be kept safe.<br> Hidden.<br> Dark and deep in the vaults...<br> ...not to be used.<br> Unless at the uttermost end of need.<br> I would not use the Ring.<br> Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin<br> and I alone could save her.<br> Ever you desire to appear lordly<br> and gracious...<br> ...as a king of old.<br> Boromir would have remembered<br> his father's need.<br> He would have brought me a kingly gift.<br> Boromir would not<br> have brought the Ring.<br> He would have stretched out his hand to<br> this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.<br> - You know nothing of this matter!<br> - He would have kept it for his own.<br> And when he returned...<br> ...you would not have known your son.<br> Boromir was loyal to me!<br> Not some wizard's pupil!<br> Father?<br> My son.<br> Leave me.<br> Careful, master. Careful.<br> Very far to fall.<br> Very dangerous are the stairs.<br> Come, master.<br> Come to Smagol.<br> Mr. Frodo.<br> Get back, you!<br> Don't touch him!<br> Why does he hates poor Smagol?<br> What has Smagol ever done to him?<br> Master?<br> Master carries heavy burden.<br> Smagol knows.<br> Heavy, heavy burden.<br> Fat one cannot know.<br> Smagol look after master.<br> He wants it.<br> He needs it.<br> Smagol sees it in his eye.<br> Very soon he will ask you for it.<br> You will see.<br> The fat one will take it from you.<br> Send forth all legions.<br> Do not stop the attack<br> until the city is taken.<br> Slay them all.<br> - What of the wizard?<br> - I will break him.<br> Where are Thoden's riders?<br> Will Rohan's army come?<br> Mithrandir.<br> Courage is the best defense<br> that you have now.<br> What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?<br> What service can a Hobbit<br> offer such a great lord of Men?<br> It was well-done.<br> A generous deed should not<br> be checked with cold counsel.<br> You are to join the tower guard.<br> I didn't think they would find any livery<br> that would fit me.<br> Once belonged to a young boy<br> of the city.<br> A very foolish one...<br> ...who wasted many hours slaying dragons<br> instead of attending to his studies.<br> - This was yours?<br> - Yes, it was mine.<br> My father had it made for me.<br> Well...<br> ...I'm taller than you were then.<br> Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,<br> except sideways.<br> Never fitted me either.<br> Boromir was always the soldier.<br> They were so alike, he and my father.<br> Proud.<br> Stubborn even.<br> But strong.<br> I think you have strength<br> of a different kind.<br> And one day your father will see it.<br> Here do I swear fealty<br> and service to Gondor...<br> ...in peace or war...<br> ...in living or dying...<br> ...from...<br> From this hour henceforth...<br> ...until my lord release me...<br> ...or death take me.<br> And I shall not forget it...<br> ...nor fail to reward<br> that which is given.<br> Fealty with love.<br> Valor with honor.<br> Disloyalty with vengeance.<br> I do not think we should so lightly<br> abandon the outer defenses...<br> ...defenses that your brother<br> long held intact.<br> - What would you have me do?<br> - I will not yield...<br> ...the river in Pelennor unfought.<br> Osgiliath must be retaken.<br> My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.<br> Much must be risked in war.<br> Is there a captain here who still has<br> the courage to do his lord's will?<br> You wish now that our places<br> had been exchanged...<br> ...that I had died<br> and Boromir had lived.<br> Yes.<br> I wish that.<br> Since you were robbed<br> of Boromir...<br> ...I will do what I can<br> in his stead.<br> If I should return,<br> think better of me, Father.<br> That will depend on the manner<br> of your return.<br> What are you up to?<br> Sneaking off, are we?<br> Sneaking?<br> Sneaking?<br> Fat Hobbit is always so polite.<br> Smagol shows them secret ways<br> that nobody else could find...<br> ...and they say "sneak."<br> Sneak?<br> Very nice friend.<br> Oh, yes, my precious.<br> - Very nice, very nice.<br> - All right. All right!<br> You just startled me is all.<br> What were you doing?<br> Sneaking.<br> Fine. Have it your own way.<br> I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.<br> We have to be moving on.<br> It's dark still.<br> It's always dark here.<br> It's gone!<br> - The Elven bread.<br> - What?<br> That's all we have left.<br> He took it. He must have!<br> Smagol?<br> No, no, not poor Smagol.<br> Smagol hates nasty Elf bread.<br> You're a lying rat!<br> What did you do with it?!<br> He doesn't eat it.<br> - He can't have taken it.<br> - Look.<br> What's this?<br> Crumbs on his jacketses.<br> He took it!<br> He took it.<br> I seen him. He's always stuffing<br> his face when master's not looking.<br> That's a filthy lie!<br> You stinking, two-faced sneak!<br> - Sam!<br> - Call me...<br> Stop it!<br> Sam!<br> - I'll kill him!<br> - Sam! No!<br> Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it<br> to go so far. I was just so... So angry.<br> Here, just...<br> Let's just rest a bit.<br> - I'm all right.<br> - No.<br> No, you're not all right.<br> You're exhausted.<br> It's that Gollum.<br> It's this place.<br> It's that thing around your neck.<br> I could help a bit.<br> I could carry it for a while.<br> Carry it for a while.<br> I could carry it... I could carry it.<br> Share the load... Share the load...<br> the load... the load.<br> Get away!<br> I don't want to keep it.<br> I just want to help.<br> See? See?<br> He wants it for himself.<br> Shut up, you!<br> Go away!<br> Get out of here!<br> No, Sam.<br> It's you.<br> I'm sorry, Sam.<br> But he's a liar.<br> He's poisoned you against me.<br> You can't help me anymore.<br> You don't mean that.<br> Go home.<br> Faramir!<br> Faramir!<br> Your father's will has turned<br> to madness.<br> Do not throw away your life<br> so rashly.<br> Where does my allegiance lie<br> if not here?<br> This is the city of the Men of Nmenor.<br> I will gladly give my life<br> to defend her beauty...<br> ...her memory, her wisdom.<br> Your father loves you, Faramir.<br> He will remember it<br> before the end.<br> Can you sing, Master Hobbit?<br> Well...<br> ...yes.<br> At least, well enough<br> for my own people.<br> But we have no songs<br> for great halls...<br> ...and evil times.<br> And why should your songs<br> be unfit for my halls?<br> Come, sing me a song.<br> Home is behind<br> The world ahead<br> And there are many paths to tread<br> Through shadow<br> To the edge of night<br> U ntil the stars are all alight<br> Mist and shadow<br> Cloud and shade<br> All shall fade<br> All shall<br> Fade<br> March!
