No!<br> Gandalf!<br> Fly, you fools.<br> No!<br> Gandalf!<br> Gandalf!<br> What is it, Mr. Frodo?<br> Nothing.<br> Just a dream.<br> Can you see the bottom?<br> No! Don't look down, Sam!<br> Just keep going!<br> Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!<br> Mr. Frodo!<br> I think I've found the bottom.<br> Bogs and rope,<br> and goodness knows what.<br> It's not natural. None of it.<br> -What's in this?<br> -Nothing.<br> Just a bit of seasoning.<br> I thought maybe if we were having<br> a roast chicken one night or something.<br> Roast chicken?!<br> You never know.<br> Sam. My dear Sam.<br> It's very special, that.<br> It's the best salt in all the Shire.<br> It is special.<br> It's a little bit of home.<br> We can't leave this here for someone<br> to follow us down.<br> Who's gonna follow us down here,<br> Mr. Frodo?<br> It's a shame, really.<br> Lady Galadriel gave me that.<br> Real Elvish rope.<br> Well, there's nothing for it.<br> It's one of my knots.<br> Won't come free in a hurry.<br> Real Elves rope.<br> Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth<br> we don't want to see any closer.<br> And it's the one place<br> we're trying to get to.<br> It's just where we can't get.<br> Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.<br> I don't think Gandalf meant for us to<br> come this way.<br> He didn't mean for a lot of things<br> to happen, Sam. . .<br> . . .but they did.<br> Mr. Frodo?<br> It's the Ring, isn't it?<br> It's getting heavier.<br> -What food have we got left?<br> -Let me see.<br> Oh, yes. Lovely.<br> Lembas bread. And look!<br> More Lembas bread.<br> I don't usually hold with foreign food. . .<br> . . .but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.<br> Nothing ever dampens your spirits,<br> does it, Sam?<br> Those rain clouds might.<br> This looks strangely familiar.<br> It's because we've been here before.<br> We're going in circles.<br> What is that horrid stink?<br> I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.<br> -Can you smell it?<br> -Yes.<br> I can smell it.<br> We're not alone.<br> The thieves. The thieves.<br> The filthy little thieves.<br> Where is it?<br> Where is it?<br> They stole it from us.<br> My precious.<br> Curse them, we hates them!<br> It's ours, it is, and we wants it!<br> This is Sting.<br> You've seen it before. . .<br> . . . haven't you, Gollum?<br> Release him or I'll cut your throat.<br> It burns!<br> It burns us!<br> It freezes!<br> Nasty Elves twisted it.<br> -Take it off us!<br> -Quiet, you!<br> It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's<br> going to hear this racket.<br> -Let's just tie him up and leave him.<br> -No!<br> That would kill us! Kill us!<br> It's no more than you deserve!<br> Maybe he does deserve to die.<br> But now that I see him, I do pity him.<br> We be nice to them<br> if they be nice to us.<br> Take it off us.<br> We swears to do what you wants.<br> We swears.<br> There's no promise you can make<br> that I can trust.<br> We swears. . .<br> . . .to serve the master<br> of the precious.<br> We will swear on. . .<br> . . .on the precious.<br> Gollum.

I said, down!<br> -Sam!<br> He's trying to trick us.<br> If we let him go, he'll throttle us<br> in our sleep.<br> -You know the way to Mordor?<br> -Yes.<br> You've been there before?<br> Yes.<br> You will lead us to the Black Gate.<br> To the Gate, to the Gate!<br> To the Gate, the master says. Yes!<br> No! We won't go back.<br> Not there. Not to him.<br> They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!<br> But we swore to serve the master<br> of the precious.<br> No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,<br> and pits, pits, pits.<br> And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.<br> And always the Great Eye watching,<br> watching.<br> Hey! Come back now! Come back!<br> There! What did I tell you?<br> He's run off, the old villain.<br> So much for his promises.<br> This way, Hobbits.<br> Follow me!<br> Merry!<br> Merry!<br> You're late.<br> Our master grows impatient.<br> He wants the Shire-rats now.<br> I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.<br> Saruman will have his prize.<br> We will deliver them.<br> Merry!<br> Merry?
