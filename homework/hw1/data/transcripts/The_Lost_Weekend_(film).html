                        You better take this along, Don.<br> It's going to be cold on the farm.<br> How many shirts are you taking?<br> - Three.<br> I'm taking five.<br> -Five?<br> Yeah, I told them at the office I might not be back<br> until Tuesday. We'll get there this afternoon.<br> That'll give us all Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.<br> We'll make it a long wonderful weekend.<br> Sounds long, all right.<br> It'll be good for you Don, after what you've been through.<br> Trees and grass and sweet cider and buttermilk...<br> and water from that well that's colder than any other...<br> Wick, please, why this emphasis on liquids?<br> Very dull liquids.<br> Sorry, Don.<br> You know, I think it'd be a good idea<br> if we took along my typewriter.<br> What for?<br> To write. I'm gonna write there. Get started on that novel.<br> You really feel up to writing?<br> -Why not?<br> I mean, after what you've been through.<br> I haven't touched the stuff for ten days now.<br> I know. I know you haven't Don.<br> Where is the typewriter?<br> -In the living room...<br> in the closet...<br> kinda towards the back.<br> Are you sure it's in the closet? I can't find it.<br> Well look by the desk.<br> Isn't it under your bed?<br> Did you find it?<br> -Oh sure, sure here it is.<br> And here's some paper.<br> Tell you what we'll do, we'll fix up a table<br> on the south porch and nobody'll disturb you.<br> And maybe Saturday we can run down to the Country Club.<br> I'm not going near that Country Club.<br> -Why not?<br> "Because they're a bunch of hypocrites<br> and I don't like to be whispered about "<br> Look who's here from New York. The Birnam brothers...<br> or rather the nurse and the invalid.<br> - Oh. Stop it Don. Nobody there knows about you.<br> No? The minute we get off the train the alarm is sounded<br> The leper is back, Hide your liquor.<br> That's Helen. I'll take it. Helen.<br> Hello, Wick. Where's Don?<br> I'm glad I made it. I was afraid you'd be gone. Presents.<br> The new Thruber book, with comical jokes and pictures.<br> A nice quiet little double murder by Agatha Christie.<br> Cigarettes, chewing gum and darling, have a wonderful time.<br> And don't forget, lots of sleep, lots of milk...<br> Lots of cider, lots of ice cold water from the well. I know.<br> Bend down.<br> And now I must be going. I've missed ten minutes<br> of the concert already. So long Wick.<br> What concert?<br> -Carnegie Hall.<br> Barbirolli conducting. They gave me two tickets at the office.<br> Who are you going with?<br> -Nobody.<br> Nobody?<br> What are they playing?<br> Brahms' Second Symphony, something by Beethoven...<br> somehing by Handel and not one note of Grieg.<br> Sounds wonderful.<br> -Goodbye, boys. See you Monday.<br> Tuesday. Wait a minute.<br> Wick, I just had a crazy idea.<br> -As for instance.<br> Who says we have to take the three fifteen train?<br> We could go on the six-thirty.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Well, I just thought we could take a later train...<br> and Helen wouldn't have to the concert by herself.<br> She's got two tickets, hasn't she?<br> No, no. I'm not going to upset any plans.<br> You're going on that three fifteen.<br> Oh. Now Helen, it's so silly!<br> A whale of a concert and an empty seat next to you.<br> No, Don. Everything's all set.<br> Now they'll be at the station to meet us<br> and dinner'll be waiting.<br> Put in a call that we're taking the later train<br> and have dinner at nine o'clock...<br> we'll be in bed by ten.<br> Nothing doing. We're going.<br> Wick is right. And don't worry about that empty seat.<br> I'll find myself a nice handsome<br> South American millionaire.<br> There you are. Did you hear her.<br> Besides, we'd have to break our necks anyway<br> to catch the train.<br> -It's five to three.<br> -You see?<br> Oh, don't be so stubborn Wick.<br> All right. Go ahead.<br> Just a minute. I'm not going.<br> Then what are we talking about?<br> Well, I want you to go. You and Helen.<br> Me and Helen?<br> -That's the idea.<br> -Who likes Brahms, you or I?<br> -Since when don't you like Brahms?<br> I'll just stick around here<br> and finish packing. Take a little nap maybe.<br> Nonsense. If anybody goes...Helen's your girl.<br> There's something in that, Don.<br> And what's more, I don't think you should be left alone.<br> -I shouldn't?<br> -No.<br> -I oughtn't be trusted. Is that it?<br> -Really, Don.<br> After what you've been through...<br> After what I've been through,<br> I couldn't go to a concert.<br> I couldn't even face the crowds.<br> I couldn't sit through it with all those people.<br> Besides, I want to be alone for a couple of hours<br> and kind of assemble myself.<br> Is that such an extraordinary thing to want?<br> Don't act so outraged, would you mind?<br> All right. Anything else?<br> Please, boys.<br> Come on, Helen.<br> -You'll stay right here?<br> -Where would I go?<br> Then you'll be here when we come back?<br> -I told you, I'm not leaving this apartment.<br> -You've told us a good many things, Don.<br> All right, if you don't belive me,<br> why don't you tak emy key and lock me in like a dog.<br> We've got to trust Don. That's the only way.<br> Sorry, Don.<br> Let's go Helen.<br> -So long, Don.<br> -So long.<br> Bend down.<br> -What's this?<br> -That? It's whiskey, isn't it?<br> -How did it get there?<br> -I don't know.<br> I suppose it dropped from some cloud. Or someone<br> was bouncing it against this wall and it got stuck there.<br> -I guess I must have put it there.<br> -Yes, you must.<br> Only I don't remember when.<br> Probably during my last spell,<br> maybe the one before. I don't know.<br> Don't look at me like that, Helen.<br> It doesn't mean a thing.<br> I didn't know it was there.<br> Even if I had, I wouldn't have touched it.<br> -Then you won't mind.<br> -Mind what?<br> Now, you trot along with Helen.<br> Why? Because of that?<br> You think I wanted you out of the apartment<br> because of the bottle?<br> I resent that like the devil...<br> and if there's one more word of discussion...<br> I don't leave on your blasted weekend.<br> Let's go, Wick.<br> You'll be good. Won't you, Don, darling?<br> Yes, Helen. Would you just stop watching me<br> all the time, you two.<br> Let me work it out my way. I'm trying, I'm trying.<br> I know you're trying, Don.<br> We're both trying.<br> You're trying not to drink...<br> and I'm trying not to love you.<br> Call the farm Don and tell them<br> we're taking the six-thirty.<br> Sure.<br> So long.<br> -Come on, Helen.<br> -Should Wick...<br> What if he goes out and buys another bottle?<br> With what? He hasn't a nickel. There isn't a store<br> or bar that'll give him five cents' worth of credit.<br> Are you sure he hasn't got<br> another bottle hidden someplace?<br> Not anymore, he hasn't.<br> I went over the apartment with a fine-toothed comb.<br> The places he can figure out!<br> Who is it? WHO IS IT?<br> Mrs. Foley. Come to clean up.<br> Well, not today. Does it have to be today?<br> I ought to change the sheets,<br> and it's my day to vacuum.<br> -Come on Monday.<br> -All right, Mr. Birnam. Is your brother in?<br> No, he isn't<br> What about my money? Didn't he leave my money?<br> -What money?<br> -My ten dollars. Didn't he leave it?<br> -Probably. And where would he leave it?<br> -In the kitchen.<br> -Where in the kitchen?<br> -In the sugar bowl.<br> Just a minute.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Foley.<br> It isn't there. He must have forgotten.<br> Oh, Putt! I wanted to do some shopping.<br> -You'll get it Monday.<br> -All right Mr. Birnam.<br> -Two bottles of rye.<br> -I'm sorry, Mr. Birnam.<br> What are you sorry about?<br> Your brother was in. He said he's not going to pay<br> for you anymore. That was the last time.<br> -Two bottles of rye.<br> -What brand?<br> You know what brand, Mr. Brophy. The cheapest.<br> None of that twelve year old,<br> aged-in-the-wood chichi. Not for me.<br> Liquor is all one, anyway.<br> -You want a bag?<br> -Yes, I want a bag.<br> Your brother said not to sell you anything<br> even if you did have the money to pay for it...<br> but I can't stop anybody, can I?<br> Not unless you're a minor.<br> I'm not a minor...<br> Mr. Brophy and just to ease your conscience,<br> I'm buying this to refill my cigarette lighter.<br> Yes, sir. Thank you.<br> -Good afternoon, Mrs. Deveridge.<br> -Hello, Mr. Birnam.<br> That's that nice young man who drinks.<br> How is my very good friend, Nat, today?<br> Yes, Mr. Birnam.<br> This being an espeically fine afternoon,<br> I have decided to ask for your hand in marriage.<br> -Look, Mr. Birnam...<br> -If that were to be your attitude, Nat...<br> I shall have to drown my sorrows<br> in a jigger of rye. Just one, that's all.<br> -Can't be done, Mr. Birnam.<br> -Can't?<br> Let me guess why.<br> My brother was here, undermining my financial structure.<br> I didn't tell him nothing about the wrist watch<br> you left here, or your cuff links.<br> Today, you'll be glad to know,<br> we can barter on a cash basis.<br> -One straight rye.<br> -That was the idea.<br> Don't wipe it away, Nat.<br> Let me have my little vicious circle.<br> You know the circle is the perfect geometric figure.<br> No end, no beginning...<br> -What time is it?<br> -Quarter of four.<br> Good. We have the whole afternoon together.<br> Will you let me know when it's a quarter of six.<br> It's very important.<br> I'm going to the country for a weekend with my brother.<br> You better take this along, Don. It's going to be cold on the farm.<br> Hello, Mr. Birnam.<br> Happy to have you back with the organization.<br> Hello, Gloria.<br> I wish I could take you along, Nat.<br> You...and all that goes with you.<br> Not that I'm cutting myself off from civilization altogether.<br> Now of course there arises the problem<br> of transportation into the country.<br> How to smuggle these two time bombs past the royal guard.<br> I'll roll one bottle in a copy of the Saturday Evening Post,<br> so my brother can discover it like that.<br> And I want him to discover it,<br> because that'll set his mind at ease.<br> The other bottle...Come here.<br> That one I'm tucking into my brother's suitcase.<br> He shall transport it himself,<br> without knowing it, of course.<br> Then, while he's greeting the caretaker,<br> I'll slide it out<br> and hide it in a hollow of the old apple tree.<br> Aw, Mr. Birnam, why don't you lay off<br> the stuff for a while?<br> Well, I may never touch it<br> while I'm there. Not a drop.<br> What you don't understand, all you you...<br> is that I've got to know it's around.<br> That I can have it if I need it. .<br> I can't be cut off completely. That's the devil.<br> That's what drives you crazy<br> Yeah. I know. I know a lot of guys like that.<br> They take a bottle and put it on the shelf.<br> All they want is just to look at it.<br> They won't even carry a corkscrew along,<br> just to make sure.<br> Then, all of a sudden...<br> they grab the bottle and bite off the neck.<br> Nat, one more reproving word<br> and I shall consult our lawyer about a divorce.<br> Now don't forget, quarter of six.<br> My brother must find me home, ready and packed.<br> Shall we dance?<br> -You're awfully pretty, Mr. Birnam.<br> -I bet you tell that to all the boys.<br> Why, natch. Only with you it's on the level.<br> -Yeah. Sit down.<br> -No thanks. Thanks a lot, but no thanks.<br> -There's somebody waiting.<br> -Him?<br> I bet he wears arch supporters.<br> Oh. He's just an old friend of the folks.<br> Lovely gentleman.<br> He buys me dimpled Scotch.<br> He sould buy you Indian rubies,<br> and a villa in Calcutta overlooking the Ganges.<br> Don't be ridic.<br> Gloria, please...<br> why imperil our friendship<br> with these loathsome abbreviations.<br> I could make myself free for later on, if you want.<br> No Gloria, I'm going away for the weekend.<br> Some other time.<br> Any time.<br> Just crazy about the back of your hair.<br> Nat, weave me another.<br> You'd better take it easy.<br> Oh. Don't worry about me.<br> Just let me know when it's a quarter of six.<br> Come on, Nat. Join me. Just one little jigger of dreams.<br> No thanks.<br> You don't approve of drinking?<br> Not the way you drink.<br> It shrinks my liver, doesn't it, Nat?<br> It pickles my kidNeys.<br> Yes. But what does it do to my mind?<br> It tosses the sandbags overboard<br> so the balloon can soar.<br> Suddenly, I'm above the ordinary.<br> I'm competent, supremely competent.<br> I'm walking a tightrope over Niagara Falls.<br> I'm one of the great ones.<br> I'm Michelangelo molding the beard of Moses.<br> I'm Van Gogh, painting pure sunlight.<br> I'm Horowitz, playing the Emperor Concerto.<br> I'm John Barrymore before the movies got him by the throat.<br> I'm Jesse James and his two brothers, all three of them.<br> I'm W. Shakespeare.<br> And out there it's not Third Avenue any longer.<br> It's the Nile, Nat.<br> The Nile and down it moves the barge of Cleopatra.<br> Come here.<br> Purple the sails, and so perfumed<br> that the winds were love-sick with them.<br> the oars were silver,<br> Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke...<br> Maybe he's at Morandi's or Nat's bar...<br> or that place on Forty-second street?<br> What difference does it make?<br> -You're not really going, Wick.<br> -I certainly am.<br> -But you can't leave him alone. Not for four days.<br> -Yes I can.<br> Oh. For heaven's sake, Wick.<br> If he's left alone, anything can happen!<br> And I'll be tied up at the office every minute.<br> All Saturday. All Sunday. I can't look out for him.<br> You know how he gets. He'll be run over by a car.<br> He'll be arrested.<br> He doesn't know what he's doing.<br> A cigarette might fall from his mouth<br> and he'll burn in his bed...<br> Oh, Helen. If it happens, it happens.<br> And I hope it does.<br> I've had six years of this. I've had my bellyful.<br> -Wick, you can't mean that.<br> -Yes I do.<br> It's terrible, I know, but I mean it.<br> -For heaven's sake, Wick...<br> -Who are we fooling?<br> We've tried everything, haven't we?<br> We've reasoned with him, we've babied him.<br> We've watched him like a hawk.<br> We've tried trusting him.<br> How often have you cried?<br> How often have I beaten him up?<br> We scrape him out of the gutter and...<br> pump some kind of self-respect into hims,<br> and back he falls, back in, every time.<br> He's a sick person.<br> It's as though there were something wrong<br> with his heart or his lungs.<br> You wouldn't walk out on him<br> because he had an attack. He needs our help.<br> He won't accept our help. Not Don. He hates us.<br> He wants to be alone with that bottle of his.<br> It's all he gives a hang about.<br> Why kid ourselves?<br> He's a hopeless alcoholic.<br> "The cloud-capp'd towers the gorgeous palaces."<br> Nat!<br> The solemn temples, the great globe itself...<br> Mr. Birnam, you ought to go home. It's late.<br> Yea, all which it inherit shall dissolve...<br> You ought to be home, on account of your brother.<br> Who says so?<br> You said so. On account of you're going away somewhere,<br> don't you remember?<br> -What time is it?<br> -Ten past six.<br> -Well, why didn't you tell me?<br> -What do you think I've been doing for a half an hour?<br> Hey, hey, your change.<br> Taxi! Taxi!<br> -I'll give you a lift as far as Grand Central.<br> -No thanks. I'm gonna wait here.<br> You're crazy.<br> Because I won't give up? Maybe I am.<br> Let go of him, Helen. Give yourself a chance.<br> Goodbye, Wick.<br> Don Dear: I waited for you to come home.<br> Please be careful. Get some sleep. Eat.<br> And call me, call me, call me, Helen<br> Hi.<br> I thought you was going away for the weekend.<br> Petes sake, what are you doing?<br> Come on and give me a drink!<br> Right with you, Mr. Birnam.<br> I'm just fixing myself some lunch.<br> Well, stop it and come on and give me a drink,<br> for heaven's sake. Come on, come on!<br> Okay.<br> -Can't you hurry it up a little?<br> -Here you are, Mr. Birnam.<br> That young lady stopped in last night, looking for ya.<br> -What young lady?<br> -The one with the leopard coat.<br> Yeah?<br> Yeah. She was acting like she just happened to drop in,<br> but I know she was making the rounds after you.<br> -What did you say to her?<br> -I said you hadn't been in for two weeks.<br> That's good. I can't let her see me.<br> Not now while I'm "off" like this.<br> Why don't you cut it short?<br> Don't talk like a child. You can't cut it short!<br> You're on that merry-go-round<br> and you've got to ride it all the way...<br> round and round...<br> till the blasted music wears itself out<br> and the thing dies down and clunks to a stop.<br> -Hey, how about you eatin' some of this?<br> -Take it away.<br> You gotta eat somethin' sometime.<br> Just give me another drink.<br> Mr. Birnam, this is the mornin'.<br> That's when you need it most, in the morning.<br> Haven't you learned that yet?<br> At night, this stuff's a drink.<br> In the morning, it's medicine.<br> Okay if I eat?<br> A little to one side.<br> Nat, are you ever scared when you wake up?<br> So scared the sweat starts out of ya, huh?<br> No, no you. With you it's simple.<br> Your alarm clock goes off and you open your eye<br> and brush your teeth and read the Daily Mirror. That's all.<br> Do you ever lie in you bed looking at the window?<br> A little daylight's coming through,<br> and you start to wonder:<br> is it getting lighter, is it getting darker?<br> Is it dawn or dusk?<br> That's a terrifying problem, Nat.<br> Because if it's dawn, you're dead.<br> The bars are closed and the liquor stores don't open<br> till nine o'clock, and you can't last till nine o'clock.<br> Or it maybe Sunday. That's the worst.<br> No liquor stores at all. And you guys wouldn't open a bar,<br> not until one o'clock. Why? Why, Nat?<br> Because we gotta go to church once in a while. That's why.<br> Yeah, when a guy needs it most.<br> What happened to those two quarts?<br> You polish them off last night?<br> -What two quarts?<br> -The two bottles you had.<br> That's right, I did have two bottles, didn't I?<br> I hid one of them. I've still got it.<br> I'm a capitalist, Nat!<br> I've got untapped reserves. I'm rich!<br> If you had enough money, you'd kill yourself in a month.<br> Say, Nat, was there a gentleman here...<br> Hello, Mr. Birnam. Didn't you go away for the weekend?<br> Apparently not, Gloria.<br> -Was there a gentleman here asking for me?<br> -Not to my knowledge there wasn't.<br> Well, he was supposed to come around twelve o'clock.<br> He's from Albany.<br> -Another friend of the folks?<br> -More a friend of a friend of the folks type.<br> A fellow called me about him.<br> Wants me to show him the town.<br> -Like Grant's Tomb for instance?<br> -But def.<br> Hey, ain't it amazing, how many guys<br> come down from Albany just to see Grant's Tomb?<br> Sometimes I wish you came from Albany.<br> Yeah? Where would you take me?<br> Lots of places. The Music Hall,<br> then the New Yorker Roof, maybe.<br> There is now being presented at a theatre<br> on Forty-Fourth Street, the uncut version of Hamlet.<br> Now, I see us as setting out for that. Do you know Hamlet?<br> I know Forty-fourth Street.<br> I'd like to get your interpretation of Hamlet's character.<br> I'd like to give it to you.<br> Dinner later, I think. Nothing before.<br> I want you to always see Shakespeare on an empty stomach.<br> Not even a pretzel?<br> Could I have a glass of water?<br> Why, sure. What'll it be for a chaser?<br> -This is Nat's Bar, isn't it?<br> -That's what the man said.<br> I'm looking for a young lady, name of Gloria.<br> Are you Miss Gloria?<br> Who, me? No, I'm not.<br> I just live with Gloria. She's not here.<br> -She isn't?<br> -No, she's sick. She went to the hospital.<br> Ruptured appendix. Middle of last night. Went like that!<br> It scared the life out of me.<br> Oh, that's terrible.<br> -Goodbye.<br> -Goodbye.<br> Could I have a word with you?<br> No thanks. Thanks a lot, but no thanks.<br> Oh. You're welcome, I'm sure.<br> Don't mensch.<br> Now, Gloria. Wasn't that rather rude to send that nice man<br> all alone to Grant's Tomb?<br> When i've got a chance to go out with you? Don't be ridic.<br> -Oh, is our engagement definite?<br> -You meant it, didn't you?<br> Oh. Surely, surely.<br> Well, I've gotta get a facial, a fingerwave, the works.<br> Right now. You're going to call for me,<br> aren't you? And, if so, what time?<br> -What time do you suggest?<br> -How about eight?<br> -Eight's fine.<br> I live right in the corner house. You know<br> where the antique shop is, the one with the wooden Indian outside?<br> -They got the Indian sign in me, I always say.<br> -I'll be there.<br> Second floor, front. Oh, Mr. Birnam,<br> all I got is a semi-formal.<br> - Will that be all right?<br> -That'll be fine.<br> So long, Nat.<br> Last one, Nat.<br> Pour it softly, pour it gently,<br> and pour it to the brim.<br> Look, Mr. Birnam, there a lot of bars on Third Avenue.<br> Do me a favor, will ya, get out of here<br> and buy it somewhere else.<br> What's the matter?<br> I don't like you much. What was the idea of pulling her leg?<br> You know you're not going to take her out.<br> -Who says I'm not?<br> -I say so.<br> -You're drunk and you're just making with your mouth.<br> -Give me a drink.<br> And that other dame...I mean the lady.<br> I don't like what you're doing to her either.<br> Oh, shut up.<br> You should've seen her come in here last night. Lookin' for you<br> with her eyes all rainy and her mascara all washed away.<br> -Give me a drink!<br> -That's an awful high class young lady.<br> You bet she is.<br> How the heck did she ever get mixed up<br> with a guy who sops it up like you do?<br> That's the problem, isn't it.<br> That nice young man who drinks, and the high-class young lady,<br> and how did she ever get mixed up with him...<br> and why does he drink and why doesn't he stop?<br> That's my novel, Nat.<br> I wanted to start writing it out in the country.<br> Morbid stuff.<br> Nothing for the Book-of-the-Month Club. A horror story.<br> The confessions of a booze addict, the log book of an alcoholic.<br> Oh, come on, Nat, break down, will ya?<br> Do you know what I'm going to call my novel?<br> The Bottle...that's all. Very simply, The Bottle.<br> I've got it all here in my mind.<br> Let me tell you the first chapter.<br> It all starts one wet afternoon about three years ago.<br> There was a matinee of La Traviata at the Metropolitan.<br> Did you forget something?<br> No. Just going home, if it's all right with you.<br> -Say, this isn't yours, is it?<br> -It certainly isn't.<br> -That's what it says though...417<br> -I don't care what it says.<br> The checks must have got mixed up.<br> -Maybe they did.<br> Find me my coat. It's a plain man's raincoat and a derby.<br> Are you kidding? Do you know how many plain men's raincoats<br> we have on a day like this?<br> About a thousand.<br> -Well, let me get back there. I can find it.<br> -No. Please, that's against regulations, sir.<br> -I am not going to wait here until the end of the performance.<br> -Well, you can get your coat tomorrow.<br> Look, man, there's something in the pocket of that coat. I...<br> Well, it so happens I find myself without any money<br> and I need that coat. And I need it now!<br> Listen, if everybody went in there digging through those coats...<br> There's regulations. There's got to be regulations.<br> Then, what do you suggest?<br> -Wait till the other party arrives, then swap.<br> -I want my coat.<br> As far as I'm concerned Mister...<br> that's your coat.<br> You're a great help.<br> That's my coat you've got.<br> And that's mine, thank heaven. They mixed up the checks.<br> -I thought you'd never come.<br> -Well you couldn't have waited so long.<br> Only since the first aria of the first act. That's all.<br> -Do you always just drop in just for the overture?<br> -Goodbye.<br> Oh, oh. Just a minute!<br> Oh, my umbrella if you don't mind.<br> Catch.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> You're the rudest person I've ever seen.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> -Oh, just rude I guess.<br> -Oh, really. Somebody should talk to your mother.<br> -They tried, Miss St. John.<br> -My name's not St. John.<br> -Well, St. Joseph then.<br> -St. James.<br> First name Hilda or Helen, or Harriet, maybe?<br> Helen.<br> Alright, Helen.<br> I also know that you come from Toledo, Ohio.<br> -You do? How?<br> Well, I've had three long acts to work you out<br> from that coat of yours.<br> Initials, labels...<br> Alfred Spitzer, Fine Furs, Toledo, Ohio.<br> -Maybe I should have explored your coat.<br> -But you didn't though.<br> -Didn't have time.<br> -Good.<br> -My name is Don Birnam.<br> -How do you do?<br> -Well, how do you like New York?<br> -Love it.<br> -You intend to stay long?<br> -Oh, sixty years, perhaps.<br> -I live here now. I've got a job.<br> -Doing what?<br> -Time Magazine.<br> -Oh. Time Magazine?<br> Then perhaps you could do something for me.<br> Could you help me become Man of the Year?<br> -Delighted. What do you do?<br> -Yes, what do I do?<br> I'm a writer. I've just started a novel. As a matter of fact<br> I've started several. But, I never seem to finish one.<br> Well, in that case, why don't you write short stories.<br> Well, I have some of those. First paragraph.<br> Then there's one-half of the opening scene of a play<br> which takes place in the leaning tower of Pisa.<br> It tempts to explain why it leans.<br> And why all sensible buildings should lean.<br> They'll love that in Toledo.<br> -Oh, by the way, are you coming here to Lohengrin next week?<br> -I don't know.<br> Because if you are, I'm not going to let<br> this coat out of my hands.<br> -Don't worry.<br> -Oh, but I do.<br> You know, to be really safe, we should go together.<br> We could.<br> Are you in the phone book?<br> -Yes, but I'm not home very much.<br> -Well, I'll call you at your office.<br> Editorial Research. If Henry Luce answers, hang up.<br> -All right. Would you like a taxi?<br> -No, thanks. I'm taking the subway.<br> Oh, very sensible.<br> As a matter of fact, I'm going to an extremely crazy party<br> on Washington Square.<br> If you'll like, I'll take you along.<br> Oh. Thank you very much, Miss St. James,<br> but I have to see a friend uptown.<br> -Oh. Goodbye, Mr. Birnam.<br> -Goodbye.<br> Who threw that?<br> -It fell out of my pocket.<br> -Do you always carry those things?<br> That friend of mine, the one uptown, he has a slight cold<br> and I thought I'd take this along and make him a hot toddy.<br> -Well, see that he gets a hot lemonade and some asprin.<br> -I shall.<br> Bye. Oh, Miss St. James!<br> Yes?<br> -What kind of a party was that you asked me to?<br> -A cocktail party.<br> -Invitation still stand?<br> -Of course. Come on.<br> Okay. So they go to that cocktail party and...<br> he gets stinko and falls flat on his face.<br> He does not.<br> By this time, he's crazy about that girl by then.<br> He drinks tomato juice.<br> Doesn't touch liquor for that whole week...<br> for two weeks, for six weeks.<br> In love, huh?<br> That's what's going to be hard to write.<br> Love is the hardest thing in the world to write about.<br> It's so simple.<br> You've got to catch it through details...<br> like the early morning sunlight hitting the gray tin<br> of the rainspot in front of her house.<br> The ringing of a telephone that sounds like Beethoven's Pastoral.<br> A letter scribbled on her office stationery...<br> that you carry in your pocket<br> because it smells of all the lilacs in Ohio.<br> Pour it, Nat!<br> He thinks he's cured.<br> If he could only get a job now,<br> they could be married and that's that.<br> But it's not Nat. Not quite.<br> Because one day, one terrible day.<br> Yeah? Go on.<br> You see, this girl's been writing to her people in Toledo.<br> They want to meet the young man.<br> So they come to New York.<br> They stay at the Hotel Manhattan.<br> Their very first day, she's to introduce him to her parents.<br> One o'clock. Lobby of the hotel...<br> Just walked in for a simple haircut.<br> No, that wasn't enough, not for New York.<br> They gave me a shampoo, scalp massage and a manicure.<br> Thought they were going to tear my shoes off<br> and paint my toenails.<br> I had a lovely morning.<br> Just did a little window shopping.<br> Didn't want to get all tired out.<br> On account of meeting that young man? Now, Mother.<br> Who did you get a haircut for?<br> -Wonder what's keeping Helen.<br> -She'll be here.<br> -This Birnam fellow went to Cornell, didn't he?<br> -I believe so.<br> But he never graduated. I wonder why.<br> -How old is he?<br> -Thirty-three.<br> He has no job. As far as I can find out, he never had one.<br> I wish Helen wasn't so vague.<br> Maybe he has a little money. Some people do, you know, Father.<br> -He ought to have a job anyway.<br> -He's a writer.<br> Writer? What did he write? I never heard of his name.<br> Now Father, relax. You always expect the worst.<br> I hope he realizes that Helen's our only daughter and<br> we ought to know a few things about him.<br> Those'll all come out...his background,<br> his prospects, his church affiliations.<br> Hotel Manhattan? Would you please page Miss Helen St. James?<br> St. James. Yeah, she's in the lobby.<br> Helen?...Don.<br> Darling, I'm terribly sorry<br> but I won't be able to get there for a while.<br> Will you please go ahead and have your lunch<br> and apologize to your parents...<br> Oh, nothing serious. I'll be there. Goodbye.<br> Turn off that light.<br> Don?<br> -Turn it off!<br> -For heaven's sake, Don.<br> I thought you were with Helen and her father and mother.<br> What happened?<br> Come on Don.<br> -I couldn't face it.<br> -Couldn't face what? Didn't you go to see them?<br> Certainly I went. One o'clock sharp. I saw them all right.<br> -Only they didn't see me.<br> -How was that?<br> Such nice, respectable people. I couldn't face them Wick...<br> and all the questions they'd ask me.<br> I just couldn't do it. Not cold.<br> I had to have a drink first. Just one.<br> Only the one didn't do anything to me.<br> So you had another and another. Oh, you poor idiot, Don.<br> Won't you ever learn with you,<br> it's like stepping off a roof<br> and expecting to fall just one floor?<br> Will you call her up Wick?<br> Tell her something. Tell her I'm sick.<br> Tell her I'm dead. Will you call?<br> Yes, I'll call.<br> You know she must have written them<br> a lot of nice things about me.<br> What a gentleman I am. A prince.<br> Which hotel is it?<br> The Manhattan. Mr. and Mrs. Charles St. James<br> of Toledo, Ohio.<br> Get up, Don.<br> Just a minute, Helen.<br> -Hello, Wick. Is Don here?<br> -Don? No.<br> Any idea where he could be?<br> Wasn't he meeting you?<br> Oh, he was supposed to meet us for lunch,<br> then he telephoned he'd be late.<br> Mother's beginning to think I just made him up.<br> -Do you suppose something happened to him?<br> -Nonsense.<br> "Oh. But surely he'd have called back<br> if her were all right."<br> -Where did he call you from?<br> -I don't know.<br> I think I have got an idea. He called from out of town.<br> -Out of town? Where?<br> -Philidelphia.<br> -What's he doing in Philadelphia?<br> -Well, there's an opening on the Philadelphia Inquirer...<br> the book section and Don wrote them, he wired them<br> and I think this morning he just took an early train.<br> Oh. Why, he didn't tell me a word about it.<br> I, I'm not supposed to tell you either.<br> He wanted it to be a surprise.<br> -He did?<br> -Yes, he...<br> he probably couldn't meet the right people right away,<br> missed a train. You know how it is.<br> Oh, it would be just wonderful<br> if he got the job and started working.<br> Or would it, Wick,<br> with him in Philadelphia and me in New York?<br> Don't ever tell him I said that though, will you?<br> Of course not.<br> I can never understand why somebody like Don,<br> a person with such talent, such flashes of real brilliance...<br> Maybe I'm a bit prejudiced.<br> What are you doing, Wick?<br> -Nothing.<br> -Where did that bottle come from?<br> -It just rolled out.<br> -From under the couch.<br> Yes, Helen.<br> -You I guess that Don caught an early train and...<br> -Is that Don's bottle?<br> -What makes you think that?<br> -There was a bottle the first time we met.<br> -There was?<br> -Fell out of Don's pocket.<br> That was for me, Helen. This one's mine too.<br> You might as well hear the family scandal. I drink.<br> Don thinks I drink too much. I had to promise to go on the wagon.<br> That's why I hid the bottle so he wouldn't see it.<br> Oh. I'm so sorry, Wick.<br> I shouldn't have started asking questions.<br> It's really none of my business.<br> Forget it, Helen.<br> I better be getting back to the hotel.<br> Don's probably there already. And don't worry,<br> Wick, I won'T mention a word of it to him.<br> -Thank you, Helen.<br> -Bye.<br> Bye.<br> Helen. I'm sorry, Helen. I can't let you go. Not like this.<br> Shut your mouth, Don. I'll take you downstairs.<br> Thanks very much for your Philadelphia Story, Wick. Nice try.<br> That looks so silly on you.<br> -Don't listen to him.<br> -You don't even have to. Just look at the two of us.<br> Yes. What is all this covering up?<br> All that happened is that Don was nervous at the idea<br> of meeting your parents and so he took a couple of drinks.<br> Come on, Wick, she'd have found out sooner or later.<br> Stop it, both of you.<br> Don's a little tight.<br> Most people drink a little.<br> A lot of them get tight once in a while.<br> Sure. The lucky ones who can take it or leave it.<br> But then there are the ones who can't take it<br> and leave it either.<br> What I'm trying to say is I'm not a drinker.<br> I'm a drunk.<br> They had to put me away once.<br> -He went to a cure.<br> -Which didn't take.<br> You see, that first time we met,<br> I should have had the decency to get drunk...<br> just for your sake.<br> For my sake? We're talking about you.<br> Is it really that bad, Wick?<br> Yes, it is.<br> Can't we go over this tomorrow, Don,<br> when you're feeling more like yourself?<br> Helen's heard the facts. That's all there is to it.<br> Yes, I've heard them and they're not very pleasant.<br> But they could be worse. After all,<br> you're not an embezzler or a murderer.<br> You drink too much and that's not fatal.<br> One cure didn't take. There are others.<br> Of course there are.<br> This has a familiar ring.<br> But, there must be a reason why you drink Don.<br> The right doctor could find it.<br> Look, I'm way ahead of the right doctor.<br> I know the reason. The reason is me. What I am.<br> Or, rather, what I'm not.<br> What I wanted to become and didn't.<br> What is it you want to be so much that you're not?<br> A writer.<br> Silly, isn't it?<br> You know, in college I passed for a genius.<br> They couldn't get out the college magazine<br> without one of my stories.<br> Boy, was I hot, Hemingway stuff.<br> I reached my peak when I was nineteen.<br> Sold a piece to the Atlantic Monthly.<br> Reprinted in the Readers' Digest.<br> Who wants to stay in college when he's Hemingway?<br> My mother bought me a brand new typewriter, and...<br> I moved right in on New York.<br> Well, the first thing I wrote, that didn't quite come off.<br> And the second, I dropped.<br> The public wasn't ready for that one.<br> I started a third and a fourth...<br> only by then, somebody began to look over<br> y shoulder and whisper...<br> in a thin, clear voice like the E-string on a violin.<br> Don Birnam, he'd whisper...<br> it's not good enough. Not that way.<br> How about a couple of drinks just to set it on its feet, huh?<br> So I had a couple. Oh, what a great idea that was.<br> That made all the difference.<br> Suddenly I could see the whole thing...<br> the tragic sweep of the great novel, beautifully proportioned.<br> But before I could really grab it<br> and throw it down on paper....<br> the drinks would wear off<br> and everything would be gone, like a mirage.<br> Then there was despair, and...<br> a drink to counterbalance despair,<br> and one to counterbalance the counterbalance.<br> And I'd sit in front of that typewriter,<br> trying to squeeze out one page that was halfway decent,<br> and that guy would pop up again.<br> What guy? Who are you talking about?<br> The other Don Birnam. There are two of us, you know:<br> Don the drunk and Don the writer.<br> And the drunk would say to the writer, come on,<br> let's get some good out of that portable.<br> Let's take it to that pawn shop over on 3rd Avenue,<br> it's always good for U$10,<br> another drink, another binge, another bender and a spree.<br> Such humorous words.<br> I tried to break away from that guy<br> a lot of times but, no good.<br> You know once I even got myself a gun and some bullets.<br> I was gonna do it on my thirtieth birthday.<br> Here are the bullets.<br> The gun went for three quarts of whiskey.<br> That other Don wanted us to have a drink first.<br> He always wants us to have a drink first.<br> The flop suicide of a flop writer.<br> All right, maybe you're not a writer.<br> Why don't you do something else?<br> Sure, take a nice job.<br> Public accountant, real estate salesman.<br> I haven't the guts, Helen.<br> Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.<br> I can't take quiet desperation.<br> But you are a writer. You have every quality for it.<br> Imagination, wit, pity...<br> Come on, let's face reality.<br> I'm thirty-three, I'm living on the charity of my brother.<br> Room and board free. Fifty cents a week for cigarettes.<br> An occasional ticket to a show or concert,<br> all out of the bigness of his heart.<br> And it is a big heart and a patient one.<br> -I've only been carrying you along for the time being.<br> -Shut up, Wick<br> I've never done anything, I'm not doing anything,<br> I never will do anything.<br> Zero, zero, zero.<br> -Now you shut up. We'll straighten it out.<br> -Look.<br> Wick has the misfortune to be my brother.<br> You just happened to walk in on this.<br> Now if you know what's good for you, you'll turn around<br> and walk out again and walk fast and don't turn back.<br> Why don't you make some coffee, Wick? Strong, three cups.<br> Look, Helen.<br> Do yourself a favor. Go on, clear out.<br> Because I've got a rival? Because you're in love with this?<br> You don't know me, Don.<br> I'm going to fight and fight and fight.<br> Bend down.<br> All right.<br> That was three years ago, Nat.<br> That's a long time to keep fighting, to keep believing.<br> She knows she's clutching a razor blade but she won't let go.<br> Three years of it.<br> And what? How does it come out?<br> I don't know. Haven't figured that far.<br> Want me to tell ya?<br> One day your guy gets wise to himself and gets back that gun.<br> Or, if he's only got a buck then, he goes up<br> to the Empire State Building, way up on top and then...<br> or he can do it for a nickel, in a subway under a train.<br> You think so, Nat?<br> What if Helen is right, and this guy sits down...<br> and turns out something good... but good...<br> and that pulls him up and snaps him out of it?<br> This guy? Not from where I sit.<br> Oh, shut up, Nat. I'm going to do it.<br> I'm going to do it now. It's all there. You heard it.<br> Yes, Mr. Birnam.<br> That's why I didn't go away on that weekend, see,<br> so I can be alone up there and sit down at my typewriter.<br> This time I'm going to do it, Nat. I'm going to do it.<br> -Maybe you will.<br> -Thank you, Nat.<br> -Am I all paid up?<br> -Yes, Mr. Birnam.<br> Goodbye, Nat.<br> I'm going home. This time I've got it. I'm going to write.<br> Good luck to you.<br> THE BOTTLE A Novel by Don Birnam<br> To Helen - With All My Love<br> You had another bottle, you know you did.<br> Where did you put it? You're not crazy. Where did you put it?<br> It was so beautiful, so wonderful,<br> the stars above us shone, we were alone,<br> we were alone...<br> Check please.<br> Right here, sir.<br> Yes sir?<br> Another gin vermouth, please.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> -Where's your wash room?<br> -Over there, sir.<br> -How about a carnation for your buttonhole?<br> -No thank you.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Wash your hands?<br> -Would you wipe my shoes?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -Carnation, sir?<br> -I already took one.<br> -You did?<br> -For a very kind lady.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> That's him.<br> You were sitting here, sir?<br> I beg your pardon.<br> You took this lady's bag, didntcha?<br> All right, let's have it.<br> Of course.<br> Somebody call a cop.<br> No, George, no. It doesn't matter as long as I have the bag.<br> Well, look in it. Maybe he took something.<br> Ten dollars, to be exact.<br> -Why I ought to kick your teeth in.<br> -George, George! He's drunk.<br> Come on. Get out of here.<br> How about the check?<br> That's why I had to borrow from the lady.<br> I didn't have enough. I'll come back and pay the rest.<br> Don't you show your face in here again ever.<br> Mike! Take him out of here.<br> Somebody stole the purse, Everybody, Somebody stole the purse<br> I assure you, I'm not a thief. I'm not a thief!<br> Somebody came and...<br> he didn't even...<br> Stop it, Helen, stop it, stop it.<br> I'm all right. I just can't talk.<br> Please, stop it.<br> You'll never make it.<br> You'll never make that hock shop.<br> It's a block and a half away.<br> This isn't Sunday, is it?<br> I asked is this Sunday.<br> -No, Saturday. Why?<br> But, it's closed. Nothing else is closed.<br> Somebody passed away, most likely.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Why are they all closed?<br> They're all closed, every one of 'em.<br> -Sure they are. It's Yom Kippur.<br> -It's what?<br> -It's Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday.<br> -It is? What you talking about?<br> -Then what about Kelly's and Gallagher's?<br> -They're closed too.<br> We've got an agreement. They keep closed<br> on Yom Kippur and we don't open on St. Patrick's.<br> That's a good joke. That's funny, that's very funny.<br> Nat.<br> Yeah, Mr. Birnam?<br> What do you want?<br> Let me have one, Nat. I'm dying. Just one.<br> I thought you was home writin' that book.<br> They're playing a trick on me. A dirty trick, Nat.<br> Give me one.<br> I'll pay it whan I can. Only just don't let me die here.<br> No credit, and you know it.<br> All right it's charity. I'm begging you. Give me one.<br> Yeah, one.<br> One's too many and a hundred's not enough.<br> That's all.<br> Oh, come on Nat, come on. I'll let you have my typewriter.<br> I'm no writer. You're the writer.<br> -Please Nat.<br> -Now go, go away.<br> I mean it. Get outta here.<br> Who is it?<br> Who is it?<br> It's me.<br> Why, Mr. Don Birnam, as I live and breathe!<br> Only if you're comin' for our date,<br> you're a little late, aren't you, Mr. Birnam?<br> And if you're comin' to apologize...no thanks.<br> Thanks a lot, but no thanks.<br> Save your saliva. I've had enough of you. Def, but def.<br> What do you think I am? I break a business date.<br> I buy me an evening purse, a facial, a new hair-do.<br> Well, maybe you can do that to your ritzy friends.<br> You can't to me, understand?<br> Okay, what do you want, Mr. Don Birnam Esquire?<br> I need some money.<br> You what?<br> Could you let me have some money?<br> Say, you out of your mind? Don't be ridic.<br> Get out of here. Make with those stairs, go on!<br> I waited half the night like it was the first date I ever had.<br> The other half I was crying.<br> How much money?<br> Could you let me have ten or five, or something?<br> I'll see.<br> You look awfully sick, Mr. Birnam.<br> Have you got a fever or something?<br> I'm all right now.<br> Thank you a lot.<br> You do like me a little, don't you, honey?<br> Why, natch, Gloria. Natch.<br> Gloria, who have you got out there?<br> Coming.<br> It's a happy, happy, happy day...<br> What's this place?<br> Hey, you, what is this place?<br> I'm talking to you.<br> Good morning, merry sunshine. How's your head?<br> -Where am I? What is this place?<br> -This? This is the Hangover Plaza.<br> -What hospital is this?<br> -Alcoholic Ward. How's your head?<br> It aches.<br> Thought you had a fracture till we looked at the X-rays.<br> Everything in one piece.<br> Just a slight concussion.<br> Why did they put me in the Alcoholic Ward?<br> Are you kiddin'? We took a peek at your blood.<br> Straight applejack. Ninety-six proof.<br> -What day is it?<br> -Sunday.<br> Are these yours? You and the colored fellow<br> were being undressed at the same time.<br> They fell out of somebody's pants.<br> They're mine.<br> - Are you a doctor?<br> -I'm a nurse.<br> Name of Nolan. They call me Bim.<br> You can call me Bim.<br> -What's your name?<br> -Birnam.<br> -What kind of Birnam?<br> -Don Birnam.<br> -Where do you live?<br> -Two-o-nine East Fif...<br> -What do you need that for?<br> -For the post card.<br> What post card?<br> To your folks, so's they'll know where honey-boy is<br> and can pick him up when he's feeling better.<br> No address.<br> Okay. We'll get it out of the phone book,<br> or the directory, or your wallet.<br> Look, no postcard. Understand? Nobody's going to pick me up.<br> The management insists.<br> If we let you guys go home alone a lot of you don't go home.<br> You just hit the nearest bar and bounce right back again.<br> What we call the Quick Richochet.<br> Look, I'm as well as you are. I can get out of here right now.<br> -Think so?<br> -Where are my clothes?<br> -Downstairs.<br> -How do I get out of this place?<br> Right through there.<br> Well, where do you think you're going?<br> To get my clothes.<br> -Got you discharge?<br> -My what?<br> -Your release?<br> -I'm all right. Let me out.<br> Get back there, go on.<br> Keep your hands off me.<br> Birnam!<br> Come here, Birnam.<br> Is this a jail?<br> Well, this department...side of a halfway hospital, halfway jail.<br> Listen, Bim, in my clothes there's five dollars.<br> That's all for you if only you won't send that post card.<br> Nothing doing.<br> I don't want anybody to know.<br> Your folks might as well get used to our little post cards.<br> What are you talking about?<br> There'll be more of 'em. You'll be back.<br> Oh, shut up.<br> Listen, I can pick an alky with one eye shut.<br> You're an alky...<br> You'll come back. They all do.<br> Him, for instance,<br> shows up every month, just like the gas bill.<br> And the one there, with the glasses,<br> another repeater. This is his forty-fifth time.<br> Big executive in the advertising business. Lovely fellow.<br> Been coming here ever since nineteen twenty-seven.<br> Good old prohibition days.<br> Say you should have seen the joint then.<br> This is nothing.<br> Back then we really had a turnover. Standing room only.<br> Prohibition! That's what started<br> most of these guys off. Whoopee!<br> Now be a good boy and drink this.<br> I don't want it.<br> Better take it.<br> Liable to be a little floor show later on around here.<br> Might get on your nerves.<br> -Floor show?<br> -Ever have the D.T.'s?<br> No.<br> -You will, brother.<br> -Not me.<br> Like to make a little bet? After all, you're just a freshman.<br> Wait'll you're a sophomore<br> that's when you start seeing the little animals.<br> You know that stuff about pink elephants, that's the bunk.<br> It's little animals.<br> Little tiny turkeys in straw hats.<br> Midget monkeys coming through the key-holes.<br> See that guy over there?<br> With him it's beetles.<br> Come the night, he sees beetles crawling all over him.<br> Has to be dark, though.<br> It's like the doctor was just telling me,<br> "Delirium is a disease of the night."<br> Good night.<br> Get the restraints and get the doctor.<br> Get him to the violent ward.<br> Over here doctor.<br> Violent ward, get the elevator.<br> Good morning.<br> Anything wrong up there?<br> Anything wrong?<br> -Are you all right?<br> -Oh. I'm fine, thank you.<br> -Have you been there all night?<br> -I've been waiting for Mr. Birnam.<br> I suppose he stayed over night with some friends.<br> He has some friends in Long Island.<br> -Now, now. What kind of story is that?<br> -I beg your pardon.<br> I'm his landlady. I know what goes on in this house.<br> I know Mr. Don Birnam.<br> I knew all about him the first week they moved here,<br> five years ago.<br> Heard those bottles rattle in the garbage can.<br> I know all about you. You're Helen St. James.<br> Your working on the Time Magazine and you're his best girl.<br> Well, I also know he's not staying<br> with any friends in Long Island,<br> he's off on another toot and you know I'm darned right.<br> Now come on down and I'll make you some breakfast.<br> I don't care for any breakfast, thank you.<br> Nor do I care for that kind of talk,<br> even supposing you're right.<br> Which I am. I could have kicked him out fifty times.<br> The last, when two taxi drivers dumped him<br> into the entrance hall out cold on the floor.<br> With all my tennants going in and out<br> and children leaving for school.<br> -Please, please.<br> -Well, I didn't put him out.<br> Not as long as his brother could pay the rent.<br> You couldn't help liking him anyway.<br> He's was so good looking. He had such nice manners.<br> He always had a little joke.<br> Stop talking about him as if he were dead.<br> Best thing for you if he was.<br> I want a quart of rye. Quick.<br> -Care if I take off my coat first?<br> -No.<br> No cracks, no questions. Just a quart of rye.<br> Be two fifteen.<br> Come on. I need that liquor, I want it,<br> I'm going to get it, understand.<br> I'm going to walk out of here with that quart of rye,<br> one way or another.<br> Miss St. James?..<br> He's back. He's upstairs, this is Mrs. Deveridge.<br> Yes, he's back. Up in the apartment.<br> I heard him yelling.<br> Don, open the door. Open it, please.<br> Don, won't you let me in? I know you're there.<br> Please, open the door.<br> Don, don't you hear me? I want to help you.<br> Don, I won't go away.<br> Do I have to go down and get the janitor<br> with the pass key to let me in?<br> Dave! Dave!<br> Yes, Mrs. Deveridge?<br> Come on up with the pass key. Come on, come on, come.<br> Thank you very much.<br> -You'd better let us come too. You can't go in there alone.<br> -I'll be all right, thank you.<br> Come Sophie. Let's go.<br> -Don, darling.<br> -Go away, Helen.<br> I'm here to help you, Don.<br> No, no.<br> Look at you.<br> You want to get up, Don. Put your arm on my shoulder.<br> You'll have a bath and I'll help you shave<br> and you'll eat and sleep,<br> and when Wick comes back everything will be all right.<br> No, Helen, don't look.<br> What's the matter, Don?<br> -That wall.<br> -What wall?<br> -The mouse and the bat.<br> -Mouse and the bat?<br> Yes, that hole in the wall right behind you.<br> -There's no hole in the wall, Don.<br> -Yes there is.<br> Don please, look for yourself. Come on.<br> Come on Don, please look.<br> You see?<br> Everything's gonna be all right.<br> I'll stay right with you.<br> It's little animals. It's always little animals.<br> That's what Bim said.<br> You're not making much sense Don.<br> You know what Nat said about the ending?<br> Like this.<br> Or like that.<br> Like this or like that.<br> Don! Don!<br> Where are you going, Don? Don.<br> All right, Don. Give me the pawn ticket.<br> -No scene, please.<br> -No scene. Just give me the pawn ticket.<br> Look, I don't want you to go in there and claim it now.<br> It would look queer.<br> You're ashamed of what the pawn broker will think,<br> is that it? It doesn't matter what I think.<br> Wick'll get you back your coat.<br> You couldn't have taken my bracelet or my pay check?<br> It had to be that coat?<br> You mean the one that brought us together?<br> Stop being sentimental.<br> Oh, I have Don, I assure you. It's finished. It's dead.<br> For three years they couldn't talk me out of you.<br> I was the only one that really understood you.<br> I knew there was a core of something...<br> well there is a core, and now I know what it is.<br> A sponge.<br> And to soak it full you'll do anything<br> that's ruthless, selfish, dishonest.<br> -I asked you not to make a scene.<br> -Then give me the ticket.<br> No, Helen, not now, please.<br> I don't want the money. You can get as drunk<br> as you like for all I care.<br> Thank you.<br> A gentleman was here a while ago.<br> How much did you give him for that coat?<br> -Why?<br> -Well, I want it back. It's my coat.<br> -It's your coat?<br> - He had my permission. How much did you give him?<br> He didn't want any money. He wanted to swap it.<br> Swap it? For what?<br> Oh, something he hocked here a long while back.<br> A gun.<br> A gun?<br> Now if you want that coat I can a...<br> As for the survivors, dear old Wick,<br> I'd recommend no flowers, and few good jokes.<br> Goodbye, Don.<br> What is it, Helen?<br> What's the matter?<br> Nothing.<br> Dave gave me the keys, I didn't think you were here.<br> What do you want here?<br> It's just that the rain is worse<br> and I couldn't get a taxi. I thought perhaps I could borrow a...<br> a coat under the circumstances.<br> Sure. How about my raincoat?<br> Funny, that we should wind up<br> after all these years just as we met,<br> -I with your raincoat...<br> -And I with your leopard coat.<br> I always got the best of the bargain.<br> Goodbye, Helen.<br> What are you looking for?<br> Well I thought perhaps,<br> maybe you might have something for my hair.<br> -Would you care to wear my black derby?<br> -Any old thing, any old scarf.<br> All right.<br> Here you are.<br> Thank you.<br> So long.<br> Do you know Don, there was still some whiskey left<br> in the bottle after I cleaned up last night.<br> Was there?<br> -Wouldn't you like to know where I put it?<br> -Nope.<br> -Don't you want a drink, Don?<br> -No.<br> Here it is, right here. Why don't you have one. Just one.<br> What are you up to?<br> Nothing.<br> I'm just ashamed of the way I talked to you,<br> like a narrow-minded, insensitive,<br> small-town teetotaller.<br> I told you, I don't feel like a drink. Not now.<br> Come on, Don. Just one.<br> I'll have one with you. I'm in no hurry.<br> This is my easy day at the office.<br> Look Helen, there are a few things<br> I want to put in order before Wick comes.<br> -Let me stay please.<br> -No.<br> I don't want to sound rude but,<br> I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.<br> Here Don.<br> You're very sweet.<br> Goodbye.<br> Don't let me bend for nothing.<br> You need this, Don. Drink it. I want you to drink it.<br> I'll get you some more. I'll get you all you want.<br> What kind of talk is that?<br> It's just that I'd rather have you drunk than dead.<br> Who wants to be dead?<br> Stop lying to me.<br> Give it to me.<br> All right. Now go!<br> No fuss, please. No calling the neighbors.<br> It won't do any good, I promise you.<br> I won't. You've made up your mind.<br> But could you tell me why? Why?<br> Because it's best all around, for everybody.<br> For you, for Wick, for me.<br> -But that's not true. We love you, Wick and I.<br> -All right. Then for me.<br> Selfish again.<br> That's a sad final word, Don.<br> Look at it this way, Helen. This business is just a formality.<br> Don Birnam is dead already.<br> -He died over this weekend.<br> -Did he? What did he die of?<br> Of a lot of things.<br> Of alcohol, of moral anemia, of fear, of shame, of D.T.'s.<br> Oh, that Don Birnam. And now you want to kill the other one.<br> What other?<br> There were two Dons. You told me so yourself.<br> Don the drunk and Don the writer.<br> Let's not go back to a fancy figure of speech.<br> There's only one Don, he's through.<br> Don.<br> I'm all right, I have enough strength left...<br> I know you have. I can see it.<br> Don't waste it on pulling a trigger, Don.<br> No, let me get it over with or do you want me to give you<br> another one of my promises that I never keep?<br> I don't want you to give me your promise,<br> I don't want you to give your promise to anybody but Don Birnam.<br> It's too late. I wouldn't know how to start.<br> The only way to start is to stop.<br> There is no cure besides just stopping.<br> -Can't be done.<br> -Other people have stopped.<br> People with a purpose, with something to do.<br> You've got talent and ambition.<br> Talent. Ambition. That's dead long ago.<br> That's drowned.<br> That's drifting around<br> with a bloated belly on a lake of alcohol.<br> No it isn't. You still have it.<br> Quit trying to stall me Helen. It's too late.<br> There's no more writing left in me,<br> it's gone. What do you expect, a miracle?<br> Yes,<br> Yes, yes! If I could just make you...<br> -Who is it?<br> -It's me, Mr. Birnam.<br> -What is it, Nat?<br> -I got somethin' for you, Mr. Birnam.<br> -I hope I ain't intrudin.<br> -What is it?<br> You know when you had that accident?<br> Afterward I found this floatin' around on the Nile.<br> She writes pretty good. I oiled her up a little.<br> And I didn't oil her up so you can hock her.<br> -I'll take it, Nat.<br> -Hello, Miss.<br> Thank you, Nat.<br> How are all them lilacs in Ohio?<br> Well Don, here it is. What do you say now?<br> -Say about what?<br> -This.<br> Someone, somewhere, sent it back.<br> Why? Because he means you to stay alive,<br> because he wants you to write.<br> I didn't ask for a big miracle.<br> Write! With these hands?<br> And a brain that's all out of focus?<br> It'll clear up again. You'll be well.<br> And I'll be sitting there staring at that white sheet, scared.<br> No you won't. You've forgotten what it feels like to be well.<br> -What am I gonna write about? What?<br> -What you've always wanted to write.<br> Where was the page I found?<br> "The Bottle. A Novel by Don Birnam,"<br> What was that to be?<br> About a messed-up life. About a man and a woman and a bottle.<br> About nightmares, horrors, humiliations,<br> all the things I want to forget.<br> Put it all down on paper. Get rid of it that way.<br> Tell it all, to whom it may concern.<br> And it concerns so many people, Don.<br> Yeah.<br> I'll fix us some breakfast.<br> We have quite a supply of milk.<br> You'll notice I didn't even find a first line.<br> Course you couldn't write the beginning<br> because you didn't know the ending.<br> Only now...<br> Only now you know the ending.<br> I'm gonna send one copy to Bim,<br> one to the doctor who loaned me his coat, and one to Nat.<br> Imagine Wick standing in front of a book store.<br> A great big pyramid of my books.<br> A Novel by Don Birnam.<br> "That's by my brother, you know."<br> That's by my fellow. Didn't I always tell you?<br> I'm going to put this whole weekend down, minute by minute.<br> Why not?<br> The way I stood in there, packing my suitcase...<br> Only my mind wasn't on the suitcase,<br> and it wasn't on the weekend,<br> nor was it on the shirts I was putting in the suitcase either.<br> My mind was hanging outside the window.<br> It was suspended just about eighteen inches below...<br> And out there in that great big concrete jungle,<br> I wonder how many others that are like me.<br> Poor bedevilled guys, on fire with thirst.<br> Such comical figures to the rest of the world,<br> as they stagger blindly...<br> towards another binge, another bender, another spree...<br>
