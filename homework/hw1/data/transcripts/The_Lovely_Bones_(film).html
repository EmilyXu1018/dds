                        I remember being really small...<br> ... too small to see<br> over the edge of a table.<br> There was a snow globe.<br> And I remember the penguin<br> who lived inside the globe.<br> He was all alone in there<br> and, I worried for him.<br> Don't worry, Kiddo...<br> He has a nice life.<br> He's trapped in a perfect world.<br> Look at that, Susie Q.<br> I remember being given a camera<br> for my birthday.<br> I loved the way a photo<br> could capture a moment...<br> before it was gone.<br> That's what I wanted to be<br> when I grew up -<br> - a 'wild-life photographer'<br> Sorry, mom.<br> I imagined that when I was older, I'd be tracking wild elephants and rhinos.<br> But, for now, I'd have to<br> make do with Grace Tarking.<br> It's strange, the memories you keep.<br> I remember going with dad<br> to the sink-hole out at the Connor's farm.<br> There was something about the way<br> the earth could swallow things whole.<br> And I remember the girl who lived there.<br> Ruth Connors.<br> The kids at our school said<br> she was weird,<br> and now I know she saw things other didn't.<br> Ready?<br> One, two, three!<br> And I remember the worst thing<br> that ever happened to us as a family.<br> Somebody help!<br> - Mom?<br> Where are you?<br> Mom?<br> Oh God!<br> Dad?<br> The day my little brother<br> stopped breathing.<br> Buckley!<br> What happened?<br> - He swallowed a twig!<br> Watch out!<br> Are you crazy?<br> - Sorry!<br> Buckley.<br> You're okay...<br> And I remember the light in my<br> parents eyes. The relief.<br> We weren't those people...<br> ... those unlucky people, to whom<br> bad things happened for no reason.<br> You know the Buddhists say,<br> "If you save someone else's life..."<br> Grandma Lynn predicted I would live a long and happy life, because I'd saved my brother.<br> As usual,<br> Grandma Lynn was wrong.<br> My name is Salmon, like the fish.<br> First name, Susie.<br> I was 14 years old when I was murdered,<br> on December 6, 1973.<br> (Announcer) Over here next, we have Crystal...<br> This was before missing kids<br> started appearing on milk cartons,<br> or were feature stories<br> on the daily news.<br> It was back when people<br> believed things like that didn't happen.<br> That's right ladies, no matter the size,<br> it'll hug your girly-girl curves in all the right places...<br> If you got it, why not flaunt it...<br> - Hold on, buddy.<br> Buckley!<br> - Dad! Look look look!<br> There it is!<br> Who is he?<br> Does he like you as much as you like him?<br> Grandma, He's a senior.<br> He doesn't know I exist.<br> - He's Cute.<br> - Grandma, please just drop it!<br> You're safe now.<br> He's gone into the record store.<br> I wasn't safe. A man in my neighborhood was watching me.<br> If I hadn't been so distracted, I would have realized something was wrong.<br> Cause that sort of thing gives me the skeevies...<br> But I was too busy, thinking about<br> the length of Ray Singh's eyelashes.<br> I counted each one in library time<br> while he was reading 'Abelard and Heloise'<br> The most seriously tragic love story ever.<br> So, have you kissed him yet?<br> Why not? You like him, he likes you,<br> What's the hold up?<br> I'm just afraid I won't be any good at it.<br> My first kiss was with grown man.<br> You not going to tell on me, are you?<br> - Of course not.<br> - What was it like?<br> - The kiss? Oh it was wonderful.<br> Beautiful, glorious.<br> Took me a long time before I realized that a kiss like that, it only happen just once.<br> Susie...<br> Just have fun, kid.<br> It wasn't Mr. O'Dwyer, by the way.<br> Although, he does look kinda suspicious.<br> Mr. O'Dwyer never hurt anyone.<br> Mr. O'Dwyer's own daughter died<br> a year and a half after I did.<br> She had leukemia,<br> but I never saw her in my heaven.<br> Hey, look at me!<br> Mom!<br> Hi honey!<br> My murderer was a man from our neighborhood<br> Thank you so much.<br> Careful honey.<br> I took his photo once as he talked<br> to my parents about his border flowers<br> I was aiming for the bushes,<br> when he got in the way.<br> Thanks for the flowers!<br> He stepped out of nowhere,<br> and ruined the shot.<br> He ruined a lot of things.<br> - What have you been photographing?<br> Everything!<br> - Everything?<br> Hey look at me!<br> Mom!<br> smile!<br> Over here!<br> Hey look at me!<br> OK. Here we go.<br> Clarissa has got a crush on you.<br> Which one was Clarissa?<br> You know, blond hair,<br> mega blue eye shadow...<br> she's out on Surf & Turf.<br> - The tall one?<br> She's not tall, she wears platforms.<br> She doesn't know you are an accountant.<br> - I take it, that's a negative<br> Or that you are a closet scale modeller<br> Did mom know before she married you?<br> About your obsession?<br> Susie, hobbies are healthy,<br> they teach you things.<br> Like what?<br> Like if you start something,<br> you finish it -<br> you don't stop until<br> you get it right.<br> If you don't get it right, you start over again...<br> and you keep on going as long as you have to.<br> That's the way it is, that's what you do.<br> It's perfectly normal.<br> You know Granpy taught me to do this,<br> and now I'm teaching you.<br> We're creating something here, for us.<br> Something special.<br> - I know<br> You're my first mate, Susie Q.<br> One day, all of this all will be yours.<br> - Jack, Susie, dinner!<br> Hey hey hey, Wait.<br> Ready?<br> Yeah<br> - Now pull it steady<br> - Give me.<br> Okay, shipman take it away!<br> Now that is a thing of beauty.<br> Come on.<br> I don't believe it.<br> Would you look at the state of this room?<br> You're gonna clean this mess up tonight.<br> - Yeah, I will.<br> Hey mom, we need to get these developed.<br> Susie, You used up all the film?<br> Do you have any idea what this is gonna cost?<br> No, no. Absolutely not.<br> Out of the question.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> That's my career down the toilet!<br> Oh, do not be so melodramatic.<br> - Oh honey, what? What's down the toilet?<br> She's used up all the film we gave her for her birthday.<br> All of it!?<br> - All of it, every single one.<br> Susie...<br> - It's a crime to be creative in this family.<br> All alright, all right, what...<br> (What say we pay for one roll a month?)<br> One roll a month?<br> You realize by the time I see my photos,<br> I'm gonna be middle aged.<br> Look, we got her 24 rolls of film, right?<br> At 2.99 a piece to develop,<br> that's $71 and 76 cents.<br> I don't think we're being unfair...<br> - Oh Honey.<br> Are we?<br> - That's why I love you.<br> Please! Could you just,<br> not do that at breakfast?<br> Yes. OK. Whatever you say.<br> Eat your food, c'mon.<br> It doesn't have a siren, you moron -<br> it's a cement mixer.<br> Please don't call your brother a moron!<br> Buddy! The cement stays in the bowl, please.<br> It's not cement, it's my Oaties!<br> Ok...<br> - Off to school - come on, let's go!<br> Bye, Dad.<br> -Bye, Susie!<br> Susie!<br> What's that?<br> - That's your new hat, sweetie.<br> Wow mom, I thought you'd given up knitting.<br> Oh no, I'm still knitting.<br> You want me to make you one too?<br> Do you have your gloves with you?<br> Put them on please, young lady.<br> Susie!

There are no breasts on this anatomy model!<br> There are no eyes or mouth either.<br> But we were told to draw in the face.<br> Your unnecessary anatomical additions got the Ellis boy thoroughly boy over-excited.<br> He stole my drawing!<br> Yes! And now there are pictures of<br> naked women all over this school.<br> Move along people!<br> Sir, can I can have my drawing back?<br> - Certainly not.<br> Did you hear me Singh?<br> Go.<br> Meet me at the mall,<br> Now!<br> Where in the mall?<br> - The Gazebo.<br> Hello.<br> - Dad!<br> No no no!<br> God, you're choking me!<br> I need some air!<br> How was your day?<br> - Good - Buckley, go wash your hands!<br> Go buddy, we'll play after dinner.<br> - Is Susie to you?<br> No.<br> - She's late.<br> Lindsey Lou, where's your sister?<br> - What?<br> Your sister.<br> - Oh, she had film club.<br> What's for dinner, hon?<br> Oh, Shoot.<br> I hope that was your homework.<br> Oh hey, you're the Salmon girl, right?<br> Yeah.<br> - Remember me? You remember me...<br> I live right down the street,<br> Down in the, uh - green house. Mr. Harvey.<br> Hi.<br> - Hi, how are ya?<br> How are your folks doing?<br> - They're fine.<br> Good, tell 'em I said hi. You know, you're the perfect person for me to run into...<br> Because I've just built this thing over here, and I want to get second opinion. Do you mind taking a look?<br> Oh... actually, Mr. Harvey, I have to get home.<br> Oh, ok.<br> I just worked so hard on it, and I guess I got excited for someone to see it, but...<br> But that's ok. I'll show the other kids in the neighborhood - they're gonna be very excited about it.<br> Really?<br> - Oh, Yeah.<br> It's great, I mean it's really neat.<br> Come on, it'll take two minutes.<br> You're probably late already.<br> I don't see anything.<br> - You don't?<br> You're gonna have to be more observant, Susie.<br> What is it?<br> I've washed my hands.<br> - Hey! You gotta dry 'em.<br> Thanks mom.<br> Ah, and the salt...<br> Oh!

Great eating habits.<br> But she's older.<br> I build it for the kids in the neighborhood...<br> I thought they could use it as a - kind of clubhouse, or I don't know...<br> You want to be the first one to try it out?<br> Really?<br> - Yeah, sure yeah! Go ahead. It'd be fun.<br> Go ahead.<br> - Corn and beans.<br> If you eat them both you can stay up<br> and watching TV with me.<br> Ah, neahh...<br> I'll make her a plate.<br> That's it - that's it...<br> Wow! This is neat-o.<br> She doesn't like beans, so I'm not going to give her any.<br> Put more - put more on her plate.<br> I'm gonna make her eat them all.<br> Why doesn't she get to eat beans?.<br> - Ok, ok - I'm gonna give her beans.<br> They're really good.<br> - Ok, watch this!<br> That's better.<br> - Pile them on.<br> You think Popeye only eats spinach?<br> There's beans in that can too.<br> Make yourself at home.<br> This is really cool Mr. Harvey<br> - Yeah it's cool, huh?<br> Yeah, I thought you kids would like a place of your own to, you know - hang out.<br> Here, have a seat.<br> Do you like it?<br> - Yeah.<br> You think she's still at the mall?<br> Yeah, probably, should be with Clarissa.<br> - She could've at least called.<br> I mean a 14 year old girl knows how to use a telephone.<br> I understand, I understand. I will deal with her when she gets home.<br> Check out all these little things, like this little, you know - fluffy animals...<br> And some games, because I know you<br> kids like play games.<br> And candles, and little figurines.<br> These angels are so pretty...<br> Very sweet, and uh, you know - some of these little things...<br> There you go!<br> It's nice with the candles and everything, right?<br> And there is one rule.<br> No adults allowed!<br> Ok?<br> That's a cute hat - I like that hat very much.<br> Would you like a refreshment Susie?<br> Actually I have to go.<br> - No, be polite.<br> You have to be polite.<br> Be polite.<br> That's another rule.<br> It's warm in here.<br> I'm warm - are you warm?<br> You can take your coat off, if you want.<br> You're very pretty, Susie.<br> Thanks...<br> Do you have a boyfriend?<br> No? I knew it, see... I knew you<br> weren't like those other girls. I knew that.<br> Mr. Harvey?<br> It's nice down here, isn't it?<br> Special - special down here, right?<br> Yes - it is, it's very special.<br> ... But I have to go.<br> I don't want you to leave.<br> I'm not going to hurt you, Susie.<br> If you see her, would you please just call? Thank you.<br> She's not with the Steads.<br> - Where are my keys?<br> Where are they?<br> - I don't know honey. In the bowl by the door?<br> Where you going?<br> Jack, could you just wait?<br> Jack, would you please wait for the police?<br> Look, stay by the phone.<br> Man, she's gonna be in so much trouble...<br> Go back to bed, sweetie.<br> Ok...<br> Guys, this is my little girl Susie. She hasn't<br> come home from school - have you seen her?<br> - No, I ain't seen nobody.<br> - No?<br> Ma'am, could you take a look at this?<br> Have you seen this little girl?<br> Sorry, buddy.<br> Can you take a look at this please? This is my little girl - she hasn't come home.<br> - I'm sorry... Could you look at that?<br> Ma'am, have you seen this girl?<br> Please, could you just take a look?<br> Susan has been missing for... what is it, four hours?<br> Susie, we call her Susie.<br> Yeah - a little more than four hours.<br> This is the first time she's run away?<br> She didn't run away - she's... she's missing.<br> Any problems at home?<br> Family difficulties?<br> Um, no - there really are no problems.<br> This is a happy... she's a happy... child.<br> She's never done this detective, she...<br> - I understand that. I just have to get a sense of...<br> She's not home, and she always comes home.<br> - of what's going on here.<br> There's nothing going on.<br> She's missing!<br> If you see her, please call me, ok? - Sure thing, Jack. I'll come back and see you guys in a little while. - Take care!<br> Dad?<br> Excuse me - Sorry to interrupt you. My name's Jack Salmon, I live right around the corner...<br> Dad!<br> Dad!<br> Can you put together a list of all her friends, and...<br> their names and contact information?<br> Uhh - a description of what she was wearing?<br> - Yes, of course - well actually, I could tell you that right now,<br> if you want to write it down.<br> She was wearing a hand-knitted wool hat...<br> Mom, Dad!<br> ... but she did wear pink gloves, and she has a beige canvas school-bag.<br> Mom?<br> No!<br> No!<br> Secure that corner!<br> Jesus Christ - and tape up the rest of the area before the whole neighborhood shows up.<br> Set up the ICP at the school.<br> What is that?<br> We found some evidence in the corn field, behind the school.<br> There was a cavity in the earth,<br> a lot of debris...<br> Mostly loose woods and broken crates.<br> We think it's the remains of some kind of structure.<br> And Susie?<br> We didn't find her, Mrs. Salmon.<br> That's good, isn't it?<br> I mean, you found Susie's hat, but you didn't find her - which means we really don't even know if she was there at all, right?<br> I mean that - it's, it's preferable, right?<br> We also found blood.<br> A significant amount of blood.<br> I'm very sorry.<br> We'll get through this.<br> - How?<br> I'm gonna take care of you. I'm gonna take care of all of us.<br> You can't.<br> - I'm gonna make it right.<br> You can't make this right, Jack. You can't!<br> We have to find her.<br> I promise we will bring her home.<br> You have my number, or you just<br> come by the police station.<br> - Ok.<br> Thank you for your time.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Have a good day.<br> - You too.<br> Mr. Harvey?<br> - Yes.<br> Detective Len Fenerman.<br> - How are you doing?<br> Do you have some time for few question ?<br> - Certainly.<br> Come in.<br> - Thanks.<br> I know why you're here. of course<br> I think when something like this happens...<br> you always blame yourself.<br> All I can think about it now is,<br> why I didn't see something, or why I didn't hear something because,<br> ...because surely, that young girl must have screamed.<br> Did you want one?<br> - No, no thanks.<br> But if you could just think back, I mean she was wearing a blue jacket, yellow corduroys...<br> Similar clothes to these.<br> This blue jacket here?<br> - The darker blue jacket.<br> And on the second photograph you can see<br> the pants she wore.<br> No, it does not ring a bell.<br> But you were home that day?<br> What day?<br> - Last Wednesday.<br> Last Wednesday...<br> Last Wednesday... Um, no - I was home all day.<br> I mean, I - I probably went out and ran a few errands or something like that, but I mean, um...<br> I should have been here all day,<br> for most part.<br> Ok, good.<br> Thanks.<br> You married?<br> - I was.<br> But You have kids?<br> - No I wish, I wish.<br> You mind if I take a look?<br> - No.<br> I make everything myself.<br> - Really? Oh yeah, all this - I turn all the banisters myself, make all the shingles and the furniture...<br> I used to do cabinet making, but there's not much call for that these days.<br> Maybe I spend too much time on these things,<br> but that's the perfectionist in me. I guess.<br> All it shows.<br> - Thank you.<br> - That's amazing craftsmanship.<br> - Oh, well...<br> I took a risk and tried something new, and discovered a talent that I didn't know I had.<br> What's that underneath the stairs?<br> - That would be the basement.<br> Dad?<br> She's dead, isn't she?<br> I was slipping away.<br> That's what it felt like.<br> Life was leaving me.<br> But I wasn't afraid.<br> Then I remembered, there was something<br> I was meant to do.<br> Somewhere I was meant to be.<br> Ray?<br> Ray!<br> Ray!<br> Ray! Wait!<br> Ray!<br> If I had but an hour of love...<br> If that be all is given me...<br> an hour of love upon this earth...<br> I would give my love to thee. - The Moor<br> Are you the Moor?<br> - Why?<br> I think this belongs to you.<br> Where did you get this?<br> I Found it.<br> I write poetry.<br> You're quite good.<br> Don't you have somewhere to go?<br> You miss her, don't you?<br> I never knew what that meant.<br> I used to think it meant lost. Frozen.<br> It means gone.<br> She's gone.<br> What if she isn't?<br> What if she's still here?<br> Help!<br> You not supposed to do that.<br> - What?<br> Who are you?<br> - She saw you, that girl.<br> I think my hand touched hers.<br> - Yes, that's all it takes.<br> She carry you now for the rest<br> of her life.<br> You are not supposed to look back.<br> You are supposed to keep going.<br> Come back. Wait!<br> Who are you?<br> I'm Holly.<br> Holly go lightly.<br> That does not sound like a real name.<br> - It isn't. I borrowed it.<br> You can do that up here.<br> - Up here?<br> You mean in heaven?<br> - (laughs) You're funny.<br> What's funny about it?<br> - This isn't heaven, not there yet.<br> What is this place?<br> - this place is not really one place...<br> and, also is not the other place<br> it's a bit of both.<br> What is that?<br> - That's where we're going.<br> Holly said there was a wide, wide heaven<br> beyond everything we knew...<br> where there was no corn field,<br> no memory.<br> No grave.<br> But I wasn't looking beyond yet.<br> I still looking back.<br> You can't go back.<br> Who are you?<br> It's over.<br> Come with me.<br> I do not know you.<br> Why are you here?<br> You need to let go of Earth.<br> You're dead, Susie.<br> You have to leave.<br> I have to go home.<br> Dad!<br> My murderer began to feel safe.<br> He knew people wanted to move on.<br> They needed to forget.<br> He took comfort in the thought<br> no one was looking at him.<br> But there was one thing my murderer didn't understand.<br> He didn't understand how much a father<br> could love his child.<br> Dad!<br> It's ok.<br> It's gonna be ok.<br> He knows I'm here.<br> My dad knows I'm here.<br> I was still with him.<br> I wasn't lost, or frozen, or gone.<br> I was alive. I was alive in my own perfect world.<br> Dad?<br> I saw Susie.<br> She came into my room.<br> She kissed me on the cheek.<br> Come here buddy.<br> I saw her too.<br> Dad? I think she listens.<br> She's used up all the film we gave her for her birthday.<br> - All of it?<br> It is a crime to be creative in this family.<br> - Shall we pay for one roll a month?<br> One roll a month?<br> I got 'em.<br> Look at these - some of these are good.<br> Honey, why don't you get them all developed?<br> This 'one roll a month' thing is...<br> is really crazy, honey - it's crazy.<br> - Why?<br> I mean why do we want to keep this thing dragging out like this?<br> We are not dragging it out.<br> We made a deal.<br> There is no deal, Jack.<br> Fenerman<br> Len, I had to call you.<br> Look, Susie is smart kid.<br> She would never go off with a stranger.<br> It had to be someone she knew.<br> Somebody local.<br> look! I've got a name for you.<br> I've got several names actually.<br> Ronald Driver.<br> - Do you have an address?<br> Len I've got another name for you.<br> He's a janitor, Michael Gitchell.<br> There's something wrong with this one, I'm telling you. Gary Davis.<br> - Who's that?<br> Davis. He works at the sanitation department.<br> - Ok, I'll look into it.<br> But I have his address right here. Is it a bad thing If I just drive by there and take a look myself?<br> Have you checked out Brent Peretti yet?<br> - Who?<br> Peretti: P-E-R-E-T-T-I. I have his credit report, Len.<br> It does not look good.<br> I'm on top of it, you understand?<br> - Len, I found another one.<br> Yeah, listen - you got to trust me ok?<br> We gonna get this guy.<br> Len, glad you're here. I was going to call you.<br> - Yeah, I got your messages.<br> I've been up to the public records office.<br> A lot of stuff to go over here...<br> I know you're looking at the obvious suspects -<br> Convicted felons, child molesters,<br> and I understand why, but Len...<br> I think you're coming at it<br> from the wrong angle.<br> Honey.<br> - Herman Stolefis, just across the street...<br> Now he appears to be perfectly normal, but Len...<br> The man wears adults diapers.<br> Herman is 80 years old.<br> - I followed him to the supermarket.<br> His shopping cart was filled with them.<br> - He has a prostate problem.<br> My point is - we need to stop looking backward.<br> We need to start looking at family histories.<br> Criminal records, mental health issues...<br> - Jack, this doesn't change anything!<br> Did I mention taxes? Len, you can tell a lot about a person from taxes.<br> Please will you just stop it now? Will you just stop!<br> Can't you just leave it alone?<br> Jack, I know it's been 11 months. I know you've been trying to deal with this in your own way but...<br> She's not coping very well.<br> She needs help, Jack.<br> She needs someone to help her<br> get through this.<br> Grandma is here! Grandma! Grandma is here!<br> What's my mother here?<br> - Look, you're not coping, ok?<br> Len's worried, I'm worried, your mother offered to help.<br> You invited her here?<br> - Darling.<br> Hello, mother.<br> - Look at you! Are you eating?<br> Is this all of it?<br> - Don't be ridiculous! That's just my make-up.<br> Oh, you're as handsome as Hell, Jack.<br> - Lindsey, honey, are you going to say hello?<br> The child hates me.<br> So, What will it be, Jack?<br> Actually, I'm not drinking these days.<br> - Ah, that's your problem in a nutshell.<br> Are we still a family?<br> - Of course we're a family!<br> Your mother's in crisis,<br> your father's a wreck.<br> What does that make you?<br> I'm in charge.<br> He walked through the woods, looking<br> for rabbits.<br> Then he sees three. He grabs his gun,<br> looks and aims.<br> And then, a giant puff of smoke -<br> he doesn't see them any more...<br> Then he realizes that his gun,<br> it was out of bullets. Then he runs.<br> You're the Salmon girl, right?<br> Ok.... O-k!<br> Holiday!<br> Grandma, I know where Susie is.<br> Yeah, Susie is gone to heaven, sweetheart.<br> - Lindsey said there is no heaven.<br> alright then, she's dead.<br> You might be dead soon.<br> - Why do you say that?<br> Because you're old.<br> too much of that polish.<br> And anyway, nothing's going to happen to me.<br> You know why?<br> Because I take my medicine, everyday.<br> Grandma, she's here.<br> What?<br> - Susie.<br> Susie's in the in-between.<br> iI was in the blue horizon, between<br> heaven and earth.<br> The days were unchanging.<br> And every night, I dreamed<br> the same dream.<br> The smell of damp earth. The scream that no one heard.<br> The sound of my heart beating, like a hammer against cloth.<br> And I would hear them calling.<br> The voices of the dead.<br> I wanted to follow them.<br> To find a way out.<br> But I would always come back<br> to the same door.<br> And I was afraid.<br> I knew if I went in there...<br> I would never come out.<br> My murderer could live in<br> one moment for a long time.<br> He could feed off the memory<br> over, and over again.<br> He was animal.<br> Faceless.<br> Infinite.<br> But then he would feel it.<br> The emptiness returning.<br> And the need would rise in him again.<br> Go.<br> - Here in?<br> When summer came, he noticed young<br> lovers would sneak into the cornfield.<br> He began to follow them, and watch.<br> Will you come to bed?<br> Yeah, soon.<br> Ohh, Buckley did this, right?<br> - Correct, he said that this is our house...<br> This is the police station, and that's you.<br> - That's me?<br> Mmm hmm!<br> Yeah, he made you chief of police, so...<br> - I've gained 20 pounds.<br> That must be, uh - the uniform.<br> - The dangers of a desk job.<br> Why don't you have a seat..?<br> I'm living with this every day!<br> - What about your marriage?<br> What marriage!?<br> Jack is sleeping in the study!<br> You have to find a way to keep going. - Mother!<br> You don't have a choice!<br> - I am coping with this! If you can't give up. you have to...<br> Ah, bingo! That is cooking Sherry! Please - Please!<br> - You have to find a way to live with this.<br> Live with it!? I am living with this!<br> - No, no - You're not! I am dealing! I'm coping!<br> I'm dealing with it. So what?<br> You have a tomb in the middle of your house!<br> Oh sweetheart, do you really think if you<br> seal it up, that the pain's gonna go away?<br> My mother went as far away as she could.<br> She found a job at a small orchard<br> outside of Santa Rosa.<br> The work was hard, but<br> she didn't mind.<br> If anyone asked, she said<br> she had two children.<br> Dearest Lindsey...<br> And Lindsey, who always said<br> she didn't believe in love...<br> found it anyway.<br> And there it was. The moment<br> I would never have.<br> My little sister had run ahead of me.<br> She was growing up.<br> What's the matter?<br> I thought you'd be happy.<br> I am happy.<br> I'm very happy.<br> Why are you crying?<br> No - you think she did not want to kiss him?<br> - No, she did.<br> She wanted to kiss him very much.<br> Always, I would watch Ray.<br> I was in the air around him.<br> I was in the cold winter mornings he spent with Ruth Conners.<br> That strange, other-worldly girl...<br> who so easily accepted the presence<br> of the dead among the living.<br> And sometimes, Ray would think of me.<br> But he began to wonder, maybe it was<br> time to put that memory away.<br> Maybe it was time to let me go.<br> Lindsey, throw it!<br> Missing girl, Susie Salmon and<br> sister Lindsey Salmon (right)<br> My Murderer had finely tuned instincts.<br> He knew my sister had begun to wonder about the solitary man who lived in the green house.<br> She seemed intent on crowding him.<br> And he resented it.<br> He began to feel a familiar itch.<br> Mom, look!<br> - Just a second.<br> Careful, honey.<br> - Mom!<br> Really, that is a beautiful smell...<br> Mom, look!<br> Hey Dad! Look at me!<br> Oh - Mr. Salmon, hi.<br> What is that?<br> - Oh, it's just a project I'm working on.<br> You're a hunter?<br> - Ducks.<br> That's a blind right?<br> Yeah.<br> - So those things really work?<br> Oh yeah.<br> It's all about concealment,<br> the art of concealment.<br> And patience. Takes a lot of patience.<br> Sit for hours on end in the dark.<br> I'm an outdoors man.<br> Always have been.<br> Mr. Salmon?<br> I just, um... I never got a chance to<br> tell how sorry I am about your loss.<br> Dad...<br> Here, let me help you.<br> - Oh no, that's alright. Really, I can manage.<br> No, it's no trouble.<br> Alright, I appreciate it.<br> Dad, look!<br> - This is for you.<br> Mr. Harvey, you really shouldn't... You are welcome.<br> That's a beautiful smell.<br> Hey, look at me!<br> - Careful, honey.<br> Oh, that really does smell...<br> Delicious.<br> - Beautiful, yeah.<br> Dad! (Isn't that something...)<br> Hey Dad, look at me!<br> I think it's time for you to<br> go home now, Mr. Salmon.<br> Go on home.<br> I'm sorry. I can't help you.<br> What did you do to her!? What did you do to MY DAUGHTER!?<br> It's gotta stop, Jack! You came this close to getting arrested tonight!<br> You're lucky George Harvey declined to press charges!<br> Lucky?<br> Your father put a hole in the man's back door.<br> Yeah, he should have put a hole in his head!<br> - Lindsey, please!<br> Did you hear that, Jack?<br> This is the example you're setting for your kids!<br> Persecuting the neighbors!<br> - He is not crazy!<br> I didn't say that.<br> - Well then why won't you listen to him?<br> Because you need evidence, Lindsey.<br> You can't go around, making accusations against George Harvey when you have no evidence!<br> You need proof!<br> - You are pathetic.<br> Why can't you just admit it?<br> You stopped looking for her, a long time ago.<br> Len's right. He's right.<br> It's time to put this behind us.<br> It's gone on too long.<br> This has to stop.<br> - Dad...<br> Things will take their natural course, Lindsey.<br> Len, I appreciate everything you've done. You've been a great friend to me.<br> That goes for Abigail, too.<br> You've been a great friend to both of us.<br> Murder changes everything.<br> When I was alive, I never hated anyone.<br> But now hate, was all that I had.<br> I want him dead.<br> I want him cold and dead,<br> with no blood in his veins!<br> Look at me!<br> Look at what he did to me!<br> What am I now? The dead girl?<br> The lost girl? The missing girl?<br> I'm nothing!<br> I was stupid.<br> I was so stupid!<br> - You don't control this, Susie.<br> He does not own you.<br> You can be free of him. But not this way.<br> What do you know? You don't know anything!<br> That man took my life!<br> You will see, Susie.<br> In the end, you will understand.<br> Everyone dies.<br> Brian!<br> - Don't worry. Go, go..<br> Ok, ok. Ha ha!<br> Dad?<br> Dad!<br> Dad!.. I realized what I had done.<br> I willed him to stop.<br> I willed him to turn back.<br> I know it's you!<br> Come out!<br> Come out and face me!<br> Did you hear me, you son of a bitch!?<br> Go off me!<br> - Sick fuck!<br> Brian, stop it!<br> Brian, stop!<br> Brian, stop it!<br> - You wanna touch my girl!?<br> Dad!<br> Dad!<br> No!<br> - Brian, stop!<br> Brian - stop! Stop!<br> Don't you get it - you killed him!<br> He's dead! He's dead...<br> - Go, go!<br> Go!<br> I knew then, he would never give me up.<br> He would never count me as one of the dead.<br> I was his daughter.<br> And he was my dad.<br> And he had loved me, as much as he could.<br> I had to let him go.<br> Sophie Cichetti, Pennsylvania.<br> She had been his landlady.<br> Jacky Meyer, Delaware.<br> She had just turned 13. Her body was found in a drainage ditch...<br> by the side of the road.<br> Lea Fox.<br> Delaware 1969.<br> She was already dead when he dumped her body in the river.<br> Lana Johnson. 1960.<br> Bucks County, Pennsylvania.<br> She was lured into a shack, he had built of old doors.<br> She was the youngest.<br> She was six.<br> Flora Hernandez.<br> Delaware, 1963.<br> He'd only wanted to touch her,<br> but she screamed.<br> Denise Li-Ang,<br> Connecticut, 1971.<br> 13. She was waiting for her father to close up their shop, when she vanished.<br> Denise Li-Ang, who sometimes liked to be called Holly.<br> Susie Salmon, 14.<br> Norristown, Pennsylvania, 1973.<br> Murdered in a room he<br> had built under the earth.<br> Come on, guys. Keep up!<br> Are you OK. Lindsey?<br> - Go on.<br> You sure?<br> -I'm fine, Go.<br> Catch up?<br> Dad!<br> Where's Dad?<br> Mom.<br> What are you doing here?<br> - What does it matter. She is home.<br> Home for Good?<br> - Of course she's home for good.<br> Where's Buckley?<br> - He's at Soccer practice, and I have to pick him up in an hour.<br> My girl.<br> - Jack.<br> Look at you!<br> What happened?<br> No, no, no. No - you're too late!<br> We're closed.<br> - Oh, you're closed, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> Oh.. Too bad - I was really hoping<br> to get rid of this thing.<br> Sorry, pal. We're fillin' her in.<br> - Oh, you're filling her in, huh?<br> - Yep. Oh, yeah, well.. I really hate to inconvenience you, but...<br> Would you like some help?<br> - Yeah, sure. That would be great.<br> I come here almost every day.<br> I like to listen to the sounds.<br> Have you seen Holly?<br> - Did she tell you about this place?<br> Yes.<br> Then you must be ready.<br> I'm Flora Hernandez.<br> The others will be here soon.<br> Who is that?<br> - I don't know.<br> But he gives me the skeevies.<br> - The skeevies? why? Are you 12?<br> It's beautiful.<br> Of course it's beautiful.<br> It's heaven!<br> Yeah, c'mon - let's go.<br> What are you waiting for?<br> You're free!<br> Almost.<br> Not quite.<br> Ray!<br> Ray!<br> Ruth!<br> What happened?<br> What's wrong?<br> Ruth?<br> Susie!?<br> You wrote me a poem once.<br> You called yourself 'The Moor'.<br> That's good, I got it from here.<br> Kiss me.<br> You are beautiful, Susie Salmon.<br> These were the lovely bones, that had grown around my absence.<br> The connections sometimes tenuous.<br> Sometimes made at great cost.<br> But often, magnificent.<br> That happened, after I was gone.<br> And I began to see things in a way...<br> that let me hold the world, without me in it.<br> Brrr - it's a cold night!<br> You looking for a ride?<br> No.<br> No?<br> Are you sure? It's pretty cold out here.<br> I'll take you wherever you want to go.<br> What do you think?<br> - Look, mister...<br> I'm not interested, ok?<br> - I'm not trying do nothing. Just trying to be polite.<br> That's all.<br> A young lady, alone at night.<br> Not safe -<br> Didn't you hear me?<br> Piss off!<br> When my mother came to my room,<br> I realized that...<br> all this time, I had been waiting for her.<br> I had been waiting so long...<br> I was afraid she wouldn't come.<br> I love you, Susie.<br> Nobody notices when me leave.<br> I mean, the moment when we really chose to go.<br> At best you might feel a whisper -<br> or, the wave of a whisper...<br> undulating down.<br> My name is Salmon. Like the fish.<br> First name, Susie.<br> I was 14 years old when I was murdered,<br> on December 6, 1973.<br> I was here for a moment.<br> And then I was gone.<br> I wish you all a long, and happy life.<br>
