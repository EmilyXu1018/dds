Now look, Fitz.<br> Take it easy.<br> [ engine starts ]<br> you won't be much use to<br> Augur if you break your neck.<br> Well, it's my neck.<br> Hey. I'm fond of mine too.<br> This'll hold us all right.<br> [ wood snaps ]<br> Well, you stay here<br> with the car in case<br> someone comes along.<br> I'll scout up the road a bit.<br> Must lead somewhere.<br> Don't be too sure.<br> Irish paths are whimsical,<br> like the Irish character.<br> [ banging ]<br> [ banging continues ]<br> [ banging ]<br> Hey.<br> Good afternoon.<br> My friend and I, we're lost.<br> Can you direct me<br> to the nearest town?<br> Oh. Oh, then you didn't<br> come here looking for me.<br> For you?<br> [ chuckles ]<br> of course not.<br> I'm looking for a town<br> where I can hire a car.<br> Indeed.<br> What might your name be?<br> Eh?<br> Your name.<br> Fitzgerald.<br> Fitzgerald!<br> Maybe if I knew why<br> you were needing a car.<br> Look. If you don't mind,<br> I'm in a terrible hurry.<br> Hurry.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> It's a strange word, "hurry."<br> why would you be in a hurry?<br> There's a very important man<br> waiting for me in New York,<br> And he's not the kind<br> that you keep waiting.<br> "important."<br> there's another one<br> of your words.<br> It's plain to see<br> that you're impatient<br> with me, Fitzgerald.<br> I've enjoyed our conversation.<br> I'll not detain you any longer.<br> [ grunts ]<br> thank you very much.<br> Then you'll not be wanting<br> thy direction.<br> Oh, yes. That's right.<br> The water from the mountains<br> comes into my pool<br> with a roar,<br> Goes out with a whisper.<br> Down the hill it goes<br> till it quietly reaches the sea.<br> And there a little village<br> called Ballynabun.<br> You, sir, may do the same.<br> I'll go get my friend.<br> Thank you very much.<br> You're entirely welcome.<br> Good day to you, sir.<br> Oh. Good day.<br> Oh, is there a--<br> [ geese honking ]<br> This'll be yours, sir.<br> Thanks.<br> And this over here, sir,<br> this'll be-- that's-that's<br> all right, sir. I can take it.<br> [ clears throat ]<br> [ grunts ]<br> Perhaps the landlady<br> will know some way out of here.<br> I'm beginning to think<br> the whole thing's<br> a conspiracy.<br> I never should have listened<br> to that old lunatic<br> up by the waterfall.<br> What waterfall is that, sir?<br> The one up the stream<br> a mile or so.<br> The Gentle Burn it's called.<br> There's no waterfall on it.<br> I suppose we wet our feet<br> in a mirage, huh?<br> Begging your pardon, sir,<br> but I've tramped<br> the length of that burn...<br> Many and many's the time<br> and I a young lad,<br> and there's no waterfall on it.<br> I guess that old fella<br> must be a friend of yours.<br> What old fella?<br> The old shoemaker<br> with the green coat<br> and the brass buttons.<br> Shoemaker with a green coat<br> and brass buttons.<br> It's him.<br> [ mutters ]<br> [ muttering ]<br> Is everybody<br> balmy in this country?<br> You saw that waterfall,<br> didn't you?<br> No. You told me it was up there.<br> Oh, yes. That's right.<br> We hit the stream below it.<br> Wonder what's wrong<br> with our friend.<br> Oh, he probably thinks<br> you saw a pixie. They're<br> quite common in Ireland.<br> Yeah, well, I'll be glad<br> to get back to New York,<br> where things make sense.<br> Because people like your<br> new boss have taken all the<br> agreeable nonsense out of life.<br> I'm beginning to think<br> you don't like Mr. Augur.<br> I don't.<br> Don't like his type.<br> I don't like him personally.<br> And above all, I don't like what<br> he does to good newspapermen<br> who go to work for him.<br> Ah, I'm gonna take a bath.<br> [ Irish accent ]<br> sure. In a fine tub.<br> But for they forgot to<br> put in the water pipes,<br> And there's not a plumber<br> this side of limerick town.<br> Don't take it so hard.<br> I like the Irish.<br> Yes, well, you can have 'em.<br> All of them,<br> including myself.<br> I wish I could still<br> have you, Fitz,<br> But I just Haven't got<br> the price to compete<br> with Augur.<br> [ knocking ]<br> come in.<br> I brought you some towels.<br> Thank you. Just put 'em<br> right here on the bed.<br> All right.<br> What time is dinner?<br> In an hour or so-- if me stove<br> doesn't take it into its head<br> to start an argument.<br> It will if it's like<br> everything else here.<br> You mustn't be<br> too hard on us.<br> We're not used to having<br> such grand guests<br> all the way from America.<br> Oh, uh, would you<br> tell the old lady<br> I'd like to see her, please?<br> There's only one<br> old lady here.<br> You're seeing her now.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Are-- are you the--<br> [ muttering ]<br> Oh, Mrs., uh--<br> Is there a Chance<br> of transportation<br> out of here?<br> If you can wait.<br> Well, I can't.<br> Well, you see, the trouble is<br> we're sea-locked.<br> There must be boats.<br> Pookawns and such.<br> But they're not much good<br> in any kind of a sea or...<br> If the wind's wrong.<br> But Sean O'Fearna<br> will be glad to take you<br> in his boat when he comes in.<br> Mm-hmm. And when is that<br> likely to be?<br> Oh, he'll be back<br> any day now.<br> Any day.<br> Tomorrow perhaps.<br> By the end of the week surely.<br> I hope you'll be<br> comfortable, sir.<br> Ah, that was<br> a good stew, Fitz.<br> It was all right,<br> if you like lamb stew.<br> I do.<br> Well, why don't you<br> pour one for yourself?<br> Huh?<br> Oh, no. Herself wouldn't<br> like it. She says a long glass<br> means a short life.<br> Oh, that's a lot of bunk,<br> isn't it?<br> Why, when I was a cub reporter<br> back in Tennessee,<br> I once interviewed a man<br> on his 110th birthday.<br> He swore it was the result<br> of drinking a pint of<br> corn liquor every morning--<br> Before breakfast.<br> Do you tell me that now?<br> That's the truth.<br> You know, you'd do me<br> a great favor if you'd mention<br> that to herself sometime.<br> I'd be delighted.<br> Anytime.<br> 110 years.<br> 110.<br> I'll take a glass of whiskey<br> with you, as you insist...<br> And as you're<br> guests of the house.<br> Well, sit down.<br> We want to, uh,<br> ask you something.<br> It's about this waterfall<br> and the old man Mr. Fitzgerald<br> had words with.<br> There's no waterfall<br> on the Gentle Burn,<br> And it was no mortal man<br> himself had words with.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Who was it then?<br> Oh, I mind well<br> who it was.<br> Oh, well, who?<br> Don't keep it<br> to yourself, man.<br> It was him.<br> The leprechaun of<br> the Gentle Burn. None other.<br> Oh, come now.<br> You don't believe<br> in those old superstitions.<br> I believe what me father knew<br> and his father before him.<br> It was a great<br> opportunity you had,<br> And the saints forgive you<br> for not taking advantage of it.<br> [ sighs ]<br> what should I have done?<br> Seized him and made him<br> give you the pot of gold.<br> What else?<br> Tsk, tsk, tsk.<br> I wish I had<br> thought of that.<br> Has anyone else ever<br> done that around here?<br> Mrs. Daly's own father,<br> Mr. William, and lived<br> to curse the day.<br> Why should he curse the day?<br> He forgot to spit on the gold.<br> [ mouthing words ]<br> a handful of pebbles was<br> all he had for his trouble...<br> And bad luck<br> for the rest of his life.<br> That's the rule, is it?<br> You have to spit on the gold?<br> [ man ]<br> any little babby<br> could tell you that.<br> You'd better be careful<br> who you talk to, Fitz.<br> Oh, he'd best at that,<br> when you hear the end of it.<br> I was here one night.<br> Miss Norah was away at school.<br> I was alone with Mr. William,<br> and he here with the drink<br> raging in him.<br> Well, he started to curse<br> every leprechaun<br> that ever cobbled a shoe,<br> And he took the bottle,<br> and he threw it<br> into the fireplace.<br> And he stood up,<br> swaying on his two feet.<br> "Taedy," he says,<br> "I'll have it out<br> with them devils<br> if it's the last thing I do."<br> And with that,<br> out through the door...<br> Before I could<br> raise a hand to stop him.<br> By your leave, gentlemen.<br> [ mutters ]<br> [ sighs ]<br> Well, come on.<br> Come on, man.<br> What's the rest of it?<br> Well, uh--<br> well, I stood<br> at the door, calling.<br> And then-- then,<br> I heard the banshee.<br> It was the first time<br> I heard it, but...<br> I knew it was all over,<br> and so it was.<br> The next morning,<br> they found him<br> by the Gentle Burn,<br> And he struck dead<br> altogether,<br> the way that he ne--<br> The way that<br> he never moved again.<br> Well, gentlemen,<br> as I was saying,<br> Drink is the curse<br> of the human race.<br> How are you, Norah?<br> Well, I think it's past<br> me bedtime, gentlemen, so<br> I'll say good night, kids.<br> One and all.<br> Taedy.<br> I'm ready for you,<br> whoever you are! Come on out!<br> Mr. Fitzgerald.<br> Oh, Mr. Fitz.<br> You gave me a start, sir.<br> What are you doing with<br> that bottle of whiskey?<br> Shh!<br> Themselves have sharp ears,<br> And they might have heard us<br> taking their names.<br> You know, it's a good thing<br> to leave a little something<br> on the doorstep.<br> Oh.<br> [ whispering ] but I always<br> thought the traditional<br> thing for leprechauns...<br> Was a glass of milk.<br> Milk?<br> Good night, Mr. Fitzgerald.<br> Good night, Taedy.<br> [ door closes ]<br> [ thuds ]<br> Let me go, you bosthoon,<br> or I'll parch your bones<br> with fever.<br> No, you don't.<br> I've got you.<br> Take your hands off me!<br> Not until you've showed me<br> your pot of gold.<br> [ grunts ]<br> [ grunts ]<br> What would a poor, simple<br> old man like me be doing<br> with a pot of gold?<br> None of that. I'm ready<br> for your lies.

You see, Mr. Driscoll<br> had four sisters.<br> The eldest was married<br> to Francis Corrigan...<br> That had a public house<br> in limerick<br> with his brother Seamus.<br> Well, that failed<br> for drinking<br> with the customers,<br> So my father took Taedy on<br> as a lad to help<br> with the horses.<br> Then he came<br> to America.<br> Corrigan.<br> No. No, Uncle Driscoll,<br> as I'm telling you.<br> You see, his favorite sister<br> was Kathleen--<br> that's Taedys mother.<br> And when young paddy<br> went to sea in 1920...<br> He changed his will,<br> leaving everything<br> to Taedy.<br> He never cared much for Rory<br> or that little witch<br> of a Ryan girl he married.<br> There was some trouble<br> with the ashes, of course.<br> Mmm. Of course.<br> They figured that their<br> mother, being the eldest,<br> was entitled to a share.<br> But Martin O'Shea had<br> done well in marriage...<br> With the O'Dooleys<br> from up knocknasheega,<br> And that was only<br> a bit of an inheritance,<br> a few shillings a month,<br> So there was no trouble<br> to persuade them not<br> to make any complications.<br> That made<br> everything very simple.<br> Oh, well,<br> it would have been...<br> But for Uncle Driscoll<br> being a bit hazy<br> in his notions...<br> And thinking<br> that Taedy was a girl.<br> So he left his money<br> to his beloved niece.<br> Can you imagine?<br> I, uh, can't think<br> what confused him.<br> Anyway, someone had to come<br> to straighten things out,<br> and Taedy wouldn't budge.<br> He mistrusts the sea<br> and refused flat-out<br> to set foot on the Atlantic.<br> He said,<br> "I'd rather die a poor man,<br> but a dry one."<br> So that's why I'm here.<br> I'm, uh, very glad<br> you made it plain to me.<br> And I'm very glad<br> you're here.<br> Oh, Stephen,<br> I never thought<br> I'd see you.<br> When I knew I was coming,<br> I wrote that nice Mr. Clark<br> in London for your address.<br> - But he didn't answer.<br> - He's probably<br> on the continent.<br> He did tell me<br> one thing, though,<br> before he left--<br> That anytime,<br> whatever might happen,<br> He'd be glad to<br> have you back with him.<br> Did he say that?<br> If it's a question<br> of passage money,<br> I'm sure he'd advance it.<br> Well--<br> oh! A bit more<br> of the nice stew!<br> Oh, no. I couldn't.<br> But you had<br> very little before.<br> But I-I--<br> aw, come on, now.<br> A drop of this'll do you good,<br> make you strong as a horse.<br> All right, Cornelius.<br> Do your duty.<br> And another<br> potato.<br> Another potato.<br> [ mutters ]<br> another potato.<br> Mr. Augur,<br> a personal question.<br> As a former newspaperman, how's<br> it feel to be against the wall<br> instead of on the firing squad?<br> It feels awful.<br> [ all laughing ]<br> Except I know you fellas<br> Will give me a break.<br> Do you think there'll<br> be another war?<br> I answered that<br> a few minutes ago.<br> No, you didn't.<br> But then,<br> nobody else has either.<br> [ all laughing ]<br> I understand you support<br> the Crawford proposal<br> for Germany.<br> [ Augur ]<br> absolutely. That's a must,<br> as far as I'm concerned.<br> [ reporter ]<br> I'd like to read you a comment<br> on this proposal. Quote:<br> "the Crawford proposal<br> is a fraud<br> on the German people,<br> "a death sentence<br> for European democracy...<br> And a betrayal<br> of American interests<br> and ideals." unquote.<br> This appeared<br> in the American spectator<br> on June 6...<br> Under the byline<br> of Stephen Fitzgerald,<br> The same Stephen Fitzgerald<br> who is running<br> your brain trust today.<br> Would you like to comment?<br> Or perhaps Mr. Fitzgerald<br> would like to discuss it.<br> Well, boys--<br> [ chuckles ] the answer<br> to that is very simple.<br> When Fitz wrote that,<br> he was working for someone else.<br> Now he's working for me.<br> [ all laughing ]<br> fellas, let me<br> change my shirt, Will ya?<br> I Haven't sweat this much<br> since my first job<br> carrying a hod.<br> You got any pictures<br> of yourself<br> carrying a hod?<br> Sorry.

I was<br> afraid for a minute that--<br> [ exhales ]<br> do you want anything<br> else, Mr. Augur?<br> No, thank you.<br> Should have told me<br> about that piece, Fitz.<br> You read it, didn't you?<br> Yeah, I read it,<br> but I didn't remember<br> it was so strong.<br> It'd be embarrassing<br> if the opposition<br> made an issue of it.<br> But you knew those were<br> my views when you hired me.<br> Well, this is politics, Fitz.<br> Where'd you put<br> that bottle?<br> Let me do it, D.C.<br> This is politics.<br> Gotta keep one jump<br> ahead of 'em.<br> [ snaps ]<br> right away, D.C.!<br> Not you.<br> I've got it. You'll do a piece<br> for new era. We don't go<br> to press till tomorrow night.<br> On foreign policy--<br> second thoughts since you've had<br> a Chance to study the situation.<br> You know, on the other hand<br> the Crawford proposal is not<br> as bad as you first thought.<br> A pretty good thing,<br> in the long run.<br> My agreement with you<br> calls for perjury,<br> but not under my own byline.<br> Fitz.<br> Have that thing on my desk<br> by tomorrow noon.<br> Here you are, D.C.<br> What are you<br> doing here?<br> I let you go out<br> this morning without<br> a clean handkerchief, sir.<br> I hope you forgive me.<br> I was thinking about it<br> all the time I was dusting.<br> I said to myself, "there's poor<br> Mr. Fitzgerald writing all those<br> important political speeches,<br> And him without a handkerchief<br> to put to his nose."<br> That's very good of you, Horace.<br> Now, if you don't mind,<br> I have some work to do.<br> Yes, sir.<br> And after this,<br> if you forget anything,<br> You don't need to<br> come chasing after me.<br> There's such a thing<br> as taking one's job<br> too seriously.<br> Oh, no, sir. Not when<br> your heart's in your work.<br> It's just a job, Horace.<br> No, sir.<br> It's more than that.<br> 'tis a life, indeed.<br> When a man enters<br> the personal services<br> of another man,<br> He must be prepared<br> to surrender himself<br> to his vocation.<br> 'tis the master who matters,<br> not the man.<br> And soon, if the man<br> takes to his work,<br> The master's wish<br> will become his wish,<br> The master's thought<br> his thought,<br> The master's soul<br> his soul.<br> When the master gets hurt,<br> the man will cry out.<br> When the master's nose itches,<br> it will be the man who sneezes.<br> He will live<br> for his master,<br> not for himself.<br> Perhaps you find it<br> difficult to understand, sir,<br> because you--<br> You are the type<br> that wears no man's collar.<br> You are a proud, free man.<br> It is for that reason<br> that I am proud to serve you.<br> Will that be all, sir?<br> Yes.

But if it's<br> important, I know he'll be<br> home for dinner tonight.<br> He's expecting<br> some guests.<br> [ laughing, chattering ]<br> Have some more steak,<br> senator.<br> No, thanks, D.C.<br> I lost my appetite<br> 20 years ago.<br> You'll find out.<br> I already have.<br> I'll pay for this<br> in the morning.<br> What is it, Jenkins?<br> There's a Mr. Fitzgerald<br> to see you, sir.<br> He says<br> it's important.<br> Ask him<br> to come in.<br> Yes, sir.<br> [ woman ]<br> Paula, were you listening<br> to the judge's conversation?<br> [ Paula ]<br> yes, I was!<br> Wasn't it brilliant?<br> No,<br> it was boring!<br> [ chattering continues ]<br> Come on in, Fitz.<br> Come in.<br> So good to see you.<br> I believe you know<br> everyone here.<br> Yes.<br> Mrs. Augur, I'm sorry.<br> I thought you'd be finished.<br> That's quite all right.<br> Senator Ransome,<br> this is Mr. Fitzgerald,<br> my good right hand.<br> - Ah, yes.<br> I've heard of this young man.<br> - Senator.<br> Have some dinner, Fitz.<br> No, thank you. I'd like to see<br> you alone, if you don't mind.<br> Sit down. We'll be through--<br> I'd rather wait in the study,<br> if it's all right with you.<br> Sure. Make yourself a drink<br> while you're waiting.<br> Thank you. Excuse me.<br> [ chattering resumes ]<br> I'll help him.<br> Will you excuse me?<br> How much do you want<br> for Mr. Fitzgerald, D.C.?<br> He's not for sale.<br> Really?<br> I understood he was.<br> [ all laughing ]<br> Well, I hear father's<br> been his usual sweet,<br> tactless self again.<br> Never mind<br> the drink, Frances.<br> I'm not in the mood.<br> Now, really, Fitz--<br> as you were instrumental<br> in getting me this job,<br> Perhaps you'd like<br> to be the first<br> to read my resignation.<br> I hope you know<br> what you're resigning from.<br> I think your father<br> made that quite clear<br> this afternoon.<br> I guess I shouldn't tell you<br> this because it's still<br> supposed to be a secret,<br> But I happen to know what<br> he has in mind for you.<br> He hasn't let me in<br> on the secret yet.<br> If he wins<br> the election,<br> He's going to have to<br> find someone to run<br> the publishing house.<br> Naturally, he'd prefer<br> to promote somebody<br> in his own organization,<br> Somebody who understands<br> the Augur way<br> of doing things.<br> Go on.<br> Of course, it would have to<br> be somebody he can trust.<br> Or manage.<br> What about Higgenbottom?<br> Oh, no, Fitz.<br> This isn't a job for a yes-man.<br> It's for a man<br> who has the intelligence<br> to recognize his big Chance,<br> Patience to wait for it<br> and the resolution to seize it.<br> Father's a bit of a fool<br> to go into politics.<br> He has more power right now<br> than a dozen senators.<br> The man who sits in his office<br> will inherit that power.<br> Not if he's still<br> running things<br> by remote control.<br> He won't be.<br> I'll see to that.<br> You? How?<br> Leave that to me.<br> D.C. Augur will be<br> perfectly happy<br> making speeches in Washington...<br> While Stephen Fitzgerald<br> makes history here in New York.<br> Well, it's a very<br> alluring prospect, but--<br> Of course you'd use the power<br> for good, Fitz, but the<br> important thing is to have it.<br> It's all very well<br> to have ideals,<br> But what good are they<br> if you can't reach<br> the people with them?<br> But I'm not sure<br> that's what I want.<br> It's what I want.<br> But you have it now.<br> No, I Haven't.<br> I can wheedle certain things,<br> But I'm not a partner.<br> You go with the job?<br> If you want me, Fitz.<br> Got some cigars here--<br> Oh.<br> Excuse me.<br> Here they are,<br> senator.<br> You needn't have<br> waited up for me, Horace.<br> I thought you might<br> require something, sir.<br> I'd like a drink.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Right away.<br> Fix one<br> for yourself too.<br> Thank you very much, sir.<br> I'd like you to drink<br> to my health, Horace.<br> I'm going<br> to be married.<br> Aye, indeed, sir?<br> Would it be<br> the tall lady, sir?<br> Hmm?<br> Oh, miss Augur. Yes.<br> Ah.<br> You're a fortunate man.<br> She'll make a fine mother<br> for your children.<br> There's more to marriage<br> than just having children,<br> you know, Horace.<br> Oh, indeed there is,<br> sir.<br> In riches and poverty,<br> sickness and health,<br> Love, honoring<br> and obeying.<br> She'll make you<br> a fine wife, sir.<br> It's a very important<br> decision,<br> Probably the most<br> important that a man<br> makes in his life.<br> Oh, indeed it is,<br> sir.<br> May I ask<br> what prompted you<br> to make it?<br> Well, one doesn't stop<br> to analyze one's behavior<br> when one's in love.<br> No, sir, but there must be<br> something about the tall lady...<br> That made you select her<br> as your partner for life.<br> Well, she's beautiful,<br> for one thing.<br> She is indeed, sir.<br> With a man's courage<br> and a man's brains.<br> Yes.<br> Is there anything wrong<br> with a woman's courage<br> and a woman's brains?<br> We won't discuss it<br> any further.<br> No, sir.<br> You have something<br> against her, Haven't you?<br> Me, sir? [ chuckles ]<br> No, sir, nothing at all,<br> at all.<br> No one's forcing you<br> to stay here and keep on<br> working for me, you know.<br> No, sir. After the wedding<br> I'll be looking<br> for another place.<br> You don't have to<br> make up your mind<br> right now, Horace.<br> You'll have no further need<br> for me after that, sir.<br> Will that be all, sir?<br> Yes, that'll be all.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Good night, Horace.<br> Good night yourself,<br> sir.<br> Oh. The saints<br> forgive me, sir.<br> I forgot to tell you<br> that I waxed the floor.<br> Yes, Horace.<br> It was very thoughtful<br> of you, Horace.<br> This is good, Fitz!<br> It's great!<br> I like this ad-lib finish.<br> I think it's just perfect<br> for the journalists club.<br> Sort of one newspaperman<br> to another.<br> How would it be if I put<br> my hands in my pockets?<br> You know, informal, homespun.<br> I wouldn't get too homespun.<br> You're liable to unravel.<br> Yeah.<br> Mustn't overdo it.<br> But this speech could be<br> one of the most important<br> in the campaign...<br> If we don't make<br> any mistakes.<br> You're certainly<br> right there, D.C.<br> Of course I'm right.<br> Don't you have<br> anything to do<br> this afternoon?<br> No. I'm all finished<br> for the day.<br> Finished for the day.<br> Well, this is<br> our Chance to recapture<br> the working press.<br> Well, if you don't have<br> any further suggestions<br> or criticism,<br> I'll see if I can get<br> that deathless document<br> mimeographed.<br> By the way,<br> I've arranged for you to sit<br> at the speaker's table tonight.<br> I wasn't planning to attend.<br> Well,<br> change your plan.<br> My agreement with you<br> doesn't cover the way<br> I spend my evenings.<br> In this case<br> it does.<br> Take it easy,<br> Fitz.<br> If these were<br> normal conditions<br> I wouldn't insist,<br> But you're a member<br> of this journalists club.<br> What'll your friends say<br> if you don't show up?<br> Assuming that I have<br> any friends left.<br> Ah, you're oversensitive.<br> There aren't 50 newspapermen<br> in this town who entirely agree<br> with their paper's policies.<br> Our relationship's a little<br> different, isn't it?<br> Sure, but this is politics.<br> Politics makes--<br> strange bedfellows.<br> I know, I know.<br> I Haven't been<br> sleeping very well<br> lately.<br> Well,<br> if I'm not complaining,<br> why should you?<br> Consider what Lincoln<br> had to put up with.<br> Here, have some of this.<br> Thank you.<br> There's a gentleman<br> to see you, sir.<br> Well, Bill,<br> you old son of a gun!<br> Hello, Fitz!<br> How are you?<br> It's good to see you!<br> Fine.<br> What brought you-- sit down.<br> Sit. Can I fix you a drink?<br> No. It's a little early.<br> How about a cigarette?<br> Oh, I keep forgetting.<br> You gave 'em up.<br> - What brought you to New York?<br> - The spectator is calling in<br> all its foreign bureau chiefs.<br> You know, consultation.<br> You live here, Fitz?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I see.<br> Oh, I'm not responsible<br> for the decoration.<br> A friend of mine did those.<br> But I'll be giving<br> the place up soon anyhow.<br> Sure, sure. I understand.<br> Pretty expensive<br> keeping a man, eh?<br> Huh?<br> Oh, I don't pay him.<br> - Oh?<br> - No, no. Augur.<br> Augur does it.<br> Augur.
