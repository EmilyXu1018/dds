Help us!<br> Help us!<br> Help!<br> (Doctor) He looks well enough.<br> I sent over some senna.<br> Was that given to him?<br> Yes. The pain got worse.<br> Whereabouts was the pain?<br> Would it not be better<br> to ask His Majesty?<br> How long have you<br> been in waiting?<br> I cannot address His Majesty<br> until he addresses me.<br> I cannot inquire after<br> His Majesty's symptoms<br> until he chooses<br> to inform me of them.<br> Sir George,<br> whatever his situation,<br> His Majesty is just a man.<br> You're the king's equerry<br> with radical notions like that?<br> Good God!<br> With any patient, I undertake<br> a physical examination<br> only as a last resort.<br> It's an intolerable intrusion<br> of a gentleman's privacy.<br> With His Majesty,<br> it's unthinkable!<br> Sharp, sharp!<br> The king! The king!<br> Ah, Baker. Yes, a ninny,<br> what, what?<br> You can tell him<br> I am much better.<br> I had a pretty smart<br> bilious attack,<br> but it has passed.<br> Would it be possible<br> to take His Majesty's pulse?<br> Would it be possible to take<br> Your Majesty's pulse, sir?<br> Yes. Do it.<br> Now don't faff, sir.<br> Hold it, man. Don't fondle it.<br> Were you responsible<br> for the senna, Baker?<br> I prescribed it<br> for Your Majesty.<br> Then you are a fool, Baker.<br> It's only a mild<br> purgative, sir.<br> Mild? 14 motions,<br> and you call it mild?<br> I could have manured<br> the whole parish.<br> If 2 glasses bring the king low,<br> can be the end of government.<br> Your Majesty was only<br> to take three spoonfuls.<br> When did three spoonfuls<br> of anything did any good?<br> Measure the medicine to the man.<br> Pulse?<br> - It's very, very fast.<br> - Good, good.<br> Your Majesty will probably<br> feel better after a warm bath<br> and its settling effect<br> on the spirit.<br> Well you have one. Your spirit's<br> more agitated than mine.<br> (King) Breathe this air,<br> Greville. Breathe it!<br> Come on, lads. Keep up!<br> This is the way we deal with<br> America. I'll teach you, sirs!<br> Take that, Mr Colonist!<br> And that, sir!<br> And that!<br> Fetch the queen.<br> No, no. That's not cricket.<br> Don't hold the bat like that.<br> (Queen) What is he doing?<br> Over there. Out of the way.<br> - Run!<br> - How's that?<br> Out!<br> - (All) Yay!<br> - Oh, good God!<br> Well done. Well done, lads.<br> The following day,<br> he rose before dawn,<br> went round to the provost<br> of Eton's lodgings,<br> and battering on the door,<br> roused the provost and commanded<br> him to show him the chapel!<br> So?<br> Lord Chancellor,<br> it was still dark.<br> Have we finished this catalogue<br> of regal nonconformities?<br> (Coughing)<br> Because I've heard nothing to<br> suggest His Majesty's behaviour<br> is in any way unusual.<br> He also harps on America...<br> the colonies.<br> Captain Fitzroy,<br> for the strongest reasons,<br> both foreign and domestic...<br> a degree of discretion.<br> And a hold on public functions.<br> No levees or concerts.<br> Just, uh...just... Hmm?<br> (Chancellor) The cork's too<br> tight in the bottle. That's it.<br> He must be the first king<br> not to have a mistress.<br> seem to me to indicate<br> a degree of conscientiousness<br> in that regard.<br> I'm talking of pleasure,<br> not duty.<br> Actually,<br> there was a mysterious illness<br> once before<br> in your father's time.<br> Government was at a standstill.<br> Well, it was of no consequence.<br> It was of no consequence<br> because he recovered.<br> It was of no consequence<br> because the Prince of Wales<br> was a child of three<br> and because Mr Fox<br> and his friends<br> were not perched in the rafters<br> waiting to come in.<br> We consider ourselves blessed<br> in our constitution.<br> We tell ourselves<br> our Parliament is the envy<br> of the world.<br> But we live in the health<br> and well-being of the sovereign<br> as much as any vizier<br> does the sultan.<br> The sultan orders it better.<br> He has his son<br> and heir strangled.<br> Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!<br> - Cricket? Pa?<br> - How's that?<br> - What, what?<br> - Well played, hey, hey?<br> To watch it, sir, was quite<br> distasteful. He was not himself.<br> Warren, what do you think?<br> I'm not the king's doctor.<br> No, nor ever will be.<br> He's more likely to go<br> to my tailor than my doctor.<br> But, sir, this is not the same.<br> Could he be ill?<br> Um...<br> Yes.<br> Morning, sir.<br> (All) Morning, sir.<br> Ohh. Ah.<br> Sherry...<br> What would happen<br> if the king were ill,<br> hmm?<br> I mean, gravely ill.<br> Your Royal Highness would have<br> to be declared regent.<br> Regent?<br> King in all but name.<br> With all the powers.<br> Subject to Parliament.<br> Charles, don't quibble.<br> (Charles) And certainly...<br> all the funds.<br> (Laughter)<br> Ha ha ha ha.<br> Just think of it.<br> Regent!<br> Prime minister.<br> (Chuckling)<br> America forgiven.<br> London rebuilt.<br> Parliament could be reformed.<br> A palace on Primrose Hill.<br> The slave trade abolished.<br> Yeah! Yeah!<br> Oh, yes. All that, too.<br> (Charles) Sir...<br> Is he ill?<br> Well, he's not well.<br> (Chuckling)<br> (Laughter)<br> I know, I know.<br> One day.<br> One day.<br> (Clock chiming)<br> It's 4.00.<br> Where are you, sirs?<br> What is this?<br> The king is unattended.<br> Up with you, sirs!<br> Braun!<br> Fortnum!<br> Papandiek!<br> Where are you, sirs?<br> What's the matter, sir?<br> It is morning.<br> That is the matter.<br> Not being attended to<br> is the matter.<br> And don't mutter or mutter<br> will be the matter.<br> What time is it, sir?<br> What is that to you?<br> The King is up.<br> When the King is awake,<br> you're awake.<br> Six hours sleep<br> is enough for a man,<br> seven for a woman,<br> and eight for a fool.<br> We've had three.<br> We went to bed at 1.00.<br> Is that insolence, sir?<br> No, sir. Arithmetic.<br> Oh. What's your name?<br> Fortnum, sir.<br> Fetch me my breeches.<br> - Yours?<br> - You know my name, sir.<br> Don't tell me what do<br> and don't know.

Help.<br> Mr King.<br> - Come on, you little bugger.<br> - Come on!<br> (King)<br> The queen will come, you said.<br> - In time, sir.<br> - It was a lie!<br> An ordained minister lied.<br> That lie will have you<br> out of that famous farm.<br> (King) Loose your tame lunatics<br> across Lincolnshire, you liar.<br> Liar.<br> I'm here.<br> Here...<br> But I'm not all there.<br> (Applause builds)<br> Yes.<br> (Pitt) I used to sit<br> with my father when he was ill.<br> I used to read him Shakespeare.<br> I never read Shakespeare.<br> I'm a clergyman.<br> They've killed the queen.<br> Did you know that?<br> No, sir.<br> Oh, yes, sir.<br> Are you cold?<br> It is chilly, sir.<br> Oh, not for me.<br> I make the weather<br> by means of mental powers.<br> Well, actually, it's not<br> too bad about the queen<br> because actually I never<br> actually married her.<br> I was married to<br> the tall one, Elizabeth.<br> (Speaking German)<br> Ah-ah! What are you saying, sir?<br> What do you mean?<br> (Counting in German)<br> Don't they speak German<br> in Lincolnshire?<br> Allow me to translate, sir.<br> Her Ladyship<br> is game for anything.<br> I just say the word!<br> - Skirts up...<br> - Gag!<br> I'm in there,<br> or she's down here...<br> (Muffled protests)<br> You assured me<br> you could cure him.<br> I can, sir, given time.<br> We do not have time!<br> - What are you praying for now?<br> - The king.<br> You should pray for us.<br> Because...<br> if he did die or stay mad...<br> George!<br> Who's to stop us<br> saying we're man and wife?<br> (Man) Don't you know<br> who the bridegroom was?<br> It is a year ago.<br> Did the bride not mention<br> she was a Catholic?<br> Why should she?<br> Aha! Aha. Here it is.<br> The prince cannot marry<br> without the king's permission,<br> and he cannot marry a Catholic.<br> You performed<br> an illegal marriage.<br> And he only gave me 10 pound.<br> Well, here's 10 pounds more.<br> Keep your mouth shut.<br> Here! That's against the law!<br> I am the law.<br> Oh, long, long days, Elizabeth.<br> And longer for His Majesty.<br> In the drawing-room, gentlemen.<br> The doctors, Your Majesty.<br> Good afternoon, Your Majesty.<br> And, uh, how are we today?<br> Blisters have healed up<br> very nicely,<br> which won't do at all.<br> Mother of God.<br> Get off me, you barbarian!<br> Ahem.<br> Bulletin.<br> "Much better."<br> Ha. I can't see it.<br> (Willis) You doubt me, sir?<br> I'll write it.<br> Could we mention<br> the stool this time?<br> Oh, the stool, the stool.<br> My dear Pepys, the persistent<br> excellence of the stool<br> has been one of this disease's<br> most tedious features.<br> When will you get it<br> into your head,<br> one can produce<br> a copious, regular,<br> and exquisitely-turned<br> evacuation every day<br> and still be<br> a stranger to reason?<br> (Pitt)<br> I will not trouble the House<br> with the detailed contents<br> of the latest,<br> and I may say,<br> generally optimistic bulletin.<br> (Chattering)<br> But honourable members would,<br> I am sure, like to know<br> that while His Majesty<br> has had ups and downs...<br> His...his health continues<br> steadily to improve.<br> (Chattering)<br> Improve? That's a barefaced lie.<br> Ups and downs?<br> (Laughter)<br> Ups and downs?<br> Mr Speaker, I can,<br> with your permission,<br> quote from a copy<br> of the same bulletin<br> handed to me by Dr Warren.<br> (All) Ooh!<br> Some of these ups and downs...<br> His Majesty's obscenities!<br> (Cheering)<br> His blasphemies!<br> (Cheering)<br> His interminable ramblings!<br> (Cheering)<br> Suffice to say this optimistic<br> bulletin concludes thus...<br> that while His Majesty<br> has had lucid intervals,<br> he remains<br> periodically demented...<br> (Cheering)<br> and incapable<br> of rational thought!<br> (Cheering)<br> I put to the House that<br> we have been deceived too long<br> over His Majesty's<br> continuing illness!<br> (All) Yes! Hear, hear! Yes!<br> When will we see the bill<br> appointing the prince regent?<br> In due course.<br> (Chanting) When? When? When?<br> It is still being drafted.<br> When? When? When? When?<br> (Chanting) When? When? When?<br> (Speaker) Order!<br> (Chanting) When? When? When?<br> Soon!<br> (Shouting)<br> (Speaker) Order! Order!<br> (Speaker) On Mr Fox's motion<br> to present the bill,<br> the House will divide, ayes<br> to the right, nos to the left.<br> (Cheering and shouting)<br> They won, by three votes.<br> Then we've lost.<br> Bring in the bill.<br> The prince must be made regent.<br> Well?<br> I'm praying, God damn it.<br> I'm almost ready<br> to give you my support.<br> Now? We don't need you now.<br> I think you do.<br> Your boy's married.<br> She's just his mistress.<br> I haven't told Mr Pitt...<br> Yet.<br> What is it you want?<br> The good of the country.<br> To remain as Lord Chancellor.<br> Well, I'm sure<br> that can be arranged,<br> when, and if, we ever manage<br> to get our hands on government.<br> The bill is ready, sir.<br> I'm a snail, Lord Chancellor,<br> creeping towards the throne.<br> Even Maria is<br> becoming impatient.<br> Only for His Majesty's<br> recovery, sir.<br> Now the Lord Chancellor has come<br> out in favour of Your Highness,<br> the end is surely in sight.<br> I have always<br> been in his favour.<br> Of course.<br> Although the present situation<br> calls for a certain delicacy.<br> This is your father, sir.<br> Be kind.<br> Rely on your oars, sir.<br> The tide is with you.<br> The tide?<br> Rely on my oars?<br> George!<br> Your Royal Highness<br> has but to wait.<br> Wait?<br> Ha. Wait.<br> Lord Chancellor,<br> my life has been waiting.<br> I endeavour<br> to cultivate languor,<br> but it is difficult<br> to be languid<br> when the throne of England<br> is pending.<br> People laugh at me.<br> What must I do<br> to be taken seriously?<br> I tell you, sir,<br> to be Prince of Wales<br> is not a position...<br> It is a predicament.<br> She has more sense than he has.<br> It takes character to withstand<br> the rigours of indolence.<br> Maria is not mentioned.<br> No, sir. It is a little<br> early for that.<br> It will happen, Maria.<br> I promise you.<br> Won't it, Thurlow?<br> Sir.<br> No.<br> No, this must not be.<br> The son in charge<br> of the father?<br> He will be put away.<br> This is his death warrant.<br> Elizabeth...<br> I must see him, Elizabeth.<br> No, I...l cannot do it, ma'am.<br> Besides,<br> if Her Majesty sees him,<br> he-he-he-he still utters<br> such improprieties.<br> About what?<br> About, uh...<br> About you.<br> Tell me.<br> I cannot say.<br> What is it His Majesty dreams<br> of doing, Mr Greville, hmm?<br> Is it this?<br> Please, madam.<br> This?<br> Ooh!<br> Or this?<br> Yay hey hey!<br> Yay!<br> Whoa! Ooh!<br> (All laughing)<br> Come on, lads.<br> Race you to the door. Come on.<br> Come on!<br> I won!<br> (Laughing)<br> Oh, Baker.<br> Baker, before you leave,<br> I have a secret mission for you.<br> I want you to hand over<br> Gibraltar to Spain.<br> Get Minorca in return.<br> Can you do that?<br> I'm a physician, sir.<br> Well, then you should have<br> no difficulty. Good afternoon.<br> Your Majesty.<br> Have you nothing<br> to say to me, sir?<br> Say, madam?<br> What is there to say?<br> We were married for 28 years,<br> never separated, even for a day.<br> You abandoned me<br> to my tormentors.<br> They said<br> it was for your own good.<br> My good?<br> What do they know of my good?<br> George, they may not<br> permit me to see you again.<br> A bill has been prepared<br> to make the son regent.<br> Regent? Hmm.<br> Do you understand?<br> He is to rule in your place.<br> Regent?<br> The fat one?<br> Hmm.<br> His Majesty was not told, madam.<br> He must know.<br> George, you must know.<br> Come away.<br> Do you understand? The son.<br> The son?<br> The father pushed aside,<br> put out, put away, ruled out.<br> The father not dead even.<br> By whose authority?<br> "The Prince of Wales should have<br> full power and authority."<br> (Mumbles)<br> "All authorities,<br> prerogatives, aides..."<br> Why was I not told of this?<br> The bill doesn't matter, sir.<br> Your Majesty...<br> This bill is to<br> be presented today.<br> Sir, the Prince of Wales<br> has a majori...<br> Greville, Dr Willis is right.<br> Take it away.<br> He's on the mend?<br> I say, that's good news.<br> Does anyone else know?<br> No.<br> It may be only temporary.<br> Well, I see no reason to<br> disseminate the information.<br> We can decide just<br> how ill His Majesty is<br> when the bill is passed...<br> Eh, Warren?<br> Nearly there, Charles.<br> Where's Thurlow?<br> "These weeks are memories<br> of those worser hours."<br> "I pray thee put them off."<br> Go on, go on.<br> "I pray thee put them off."<br> "How does the king..."<br> - Lord Thurlow, sir.<br> - The very man.<br> Yes, we're reading Shakespeare.<br> Willis, give him the book.<br> Oh, King Lear.<br> Is that wise?<br> I had no idea<br> what it was about, sir.<br> Now, I'm asleep, apparently,<br> and Cordelia comes in<br> and asks the doctor - Greville -<br> how I am. Off we go.<br> Uh, who's Cordelia?<br> (King) You are.<br> Yes, but Willis can't do it.<br> He's a fine doctor<br> but a hopeless actor.<br> Off you 90-<br> Ahem.<br> "Oh, you kind gods,<br> "cure this great breach<br> in his abused nature.<br> "The untuned and jarring<br> senses, oh, wind up,<br> "of this child-changed father."<br> That's very good.<br> Yes, the child-changed<br> father's very good.<br> Yes, go on, Greville,<br> it's you now.<br> "He hath slept long.<br> "Be by, good madam,<br> "when we do awaken him.<br> "I doubt not of his temperance."<br> "Oh, my dear father.<br> "Restoration, hang<br> thy medicine on my lips<br> "and let this kiss<br> "repair those violent harms<br> "which my two sisters<br> have in thy reverence made."<br> Well, come on, man, kiss me.<br> Not there, man. Here, here.<br> It's Shakespeare.<br> Right.<br> No, no. Push off again.<br> This is the moment<br> when the king awakes, you see.<br> You ready?<br> That's it. Come on.<br> "How fares my royal lord?<br> "How does Your Majesty?"<br> "You do me wrong to take<br> me out of the grave.<br> "Thou art a soul in bliss,<br> "but I am bound<br> upon a wheel of fire,<br> "that mine own tears do<br> scald like molten lead."<br> It's so true.<br> "Pray do not mock me.<br> I am a very foolish,<br> fond old man."<br> "And to deal plainly..."<br> "I fear I'm not<br> in my perfect mind."<br> Is that the end, Your Majesty?<br> Oh, good Lord, no.<br> Cordelia -<br> that's Thurlow - dies,<br> hanged, and the shock<br> of it kills the king.<br> So they all die.<br> It's a tragedy.<br> Very affecting.<br> Well, it's the way I play it.<br> Your Majesty<br> seems more yourself.<br> Do I?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Yeah, I've always been myself,<br> even when I was ill.<br> Only now I seem myself.<br> And that's the important thing.<br> I have remembered how to seem.<br> What, what?<br> What did Your Majesty say?<br> What? I didn't say anything.<br> Besides, Greville, you shouldn't<br> ask the king questions.<br> You should know that.<br> What, what?<br> Get him ready.<br> Look at his piss.<br> We're back to lemonade.<br> It's still a bit inky.<br> That's yesterday's.<br> This is today's.<br> Here, piss the elder,<br> piss the younger.<br> (Both laugh)<br> (Coachman) Go on! Hyah! Hyah!<br> (Cheering)<br> (Speaker) The matter before this<br> house<br> is a bill to provide for the<br> care of His Majesty's person,<br> and for the administration<br> of the royal authority<br> during the continuance<br> of His Majesty's illness.<br> (All) Hear, hear!<br> (Man) Mr Speaker,<br> we on this side of the House<br> count ourselves fortunate<br> that we have in the person<br> of the Prince of Wales<br> a young man of such<br> character and aptitude.<br> (Cheering)<br> What now?<br> And so, Mr Speaker,<br> I would like to set out<br> some measures of<br> long overdue reform,<br> and, yes,<br> I may be bold to say it,<br> necessary expenditure...<br> I've just been with His Majesty<br> for two hours of uninterrupted<br> conversation with him.<br> - He means he's talking again.<br> - No, damn it!<br> Well, yes, but not 15 to the<br> dozen, and not nonsense, either.<br> He's actually<br> a damn clever fellow.<br> Had me reading Shakespeare.<br> Have you read King Lear?<br> Tragic story.<br> Of course!<br> If that fool of a messenger<br> had got a move on,<br> Cordelia wouldn't<br> have been hanged,<br> Lear wouldn't have died, and<br> it would have ended happily.<br> As it is, it's so damned tragic.<br> The point is,<br> the king is better.<br> Better than he was?<br> No, better. The "What, what?"<br> is back. Come.<br> No one, Mr Speaker,<br> entertains a higher regard<br> for His Majesty than I do.<br> But we cannot close<br> our eyes to the fact<br> that His Majesty<br> has been overtaken<br> by a terrible and I fear<br> long-lasting illness<br> that seems immune to all forms<br> of medical treatment.<br> I...<br> We're...<br> We're very touched...<br> by the concern...<br> shown by our most<br> loyal subjects...<br> And very - very happy<br> to be amongst you all again.<br> Be assured that now that<br> our strength has returned,<br> we will once more...<br> take up the reigns<br> of government.<br> (Man) Long live the king!<br> How was that?<br> Not bad, what, what?<br> # God save the king<br> # Long live the king<br> # God save the king<br> # May he live forever #<br> Papa! Papa! Hooray!<br> Pa, you're back! You're back!<br> Oh! Oh!<br> Come with me. Come with me.<br> Mama is in the garden.<br> (Queen) Two hours late!<br> He does this on purpose.<br> He knows it is his lateness<br> that always drives you mad.<br> Fear not. I shall strike<br> a note of reconciliation.<br> Love, that's the keynote.<br> Their Royal Highnesses,<br> Your Majesty.<br> Fred.<br> Pa.<br> George.<br> Oh, do, please...<br> How is Your Majesty?<br> Fat lot you care!<br> Love, George.<br> You smile, sir.<br> I'm happy to see<br> my father his old self,<br> in such good spirits, sir.<br> Good or bad,<br> I am in control of them, sir.<br> When a man can control himself<br> his spirits are immaterial.<br> When a man<br> cannot control himself,<br> he would do well to be sober!<br> - He would do well-<br> - Ahem!<br> Marry, sir.<br> I am married, sir.<br> Somebody big. Somebody German.<br> Children, what, what?<br> I am married, sir...<br> Not without my say-so!<br> And I do not say so.<br> I will not say so.<br> You are not married, sir.<br> Ahem.<br> If you have a cough,<br> sir, take it outside!<br> (King) Put her away, sir.<br> Your debts will be paid,<br> and you will have an income<br> that is appropriate.<br> (King) Is it any wonder<br> a man goes mad?<br> Doctors! 30 guineas a visit<br> and travelling expenses,<br> for six months of torture.<br> They would have a man pay for<br> his own execution, what, what?<br> How much is he getting?<br> An annuity.<br> 1,000 a year, sir.<br> Well, he's done me some service.<br> I think it is time<br> has done you the service, sir.<br> Yes? Mmm, but what<br> of the colonies, Mr Pitt?<br> America is now a nation, sir.<br> Well.<br> We must get used to it.<br> I have known stranger things.<br> I once saw a sheep<br> with five legs.<br> (Man) Sacked?<br> Jesus!<br> - And me?<br> - Forget what you've seen,<br> majesty in its small clothes.<br> Wipe it from your memory.<br> He was ill. We knew that.<br> Yes, and now he's well.<br> Here.<br> Me, too.<br> I'm no longer in service.<br> You were kind to His Majesty<br> during his illness, Greville.<br> I did what I could,<br> Captain Fitzroy.<br> Colonel Fitzroy.<br> Did you not know that?<br> It seems unfair, I agree,<br> but a word of advice.<br> To be kind does not<br> commend you to kings.<br> They see it as they see<br> any flow of feeling,<br> as a liberty.<br> A blind eye<br> will serve you better,<br> and you will travel further.<br> Elizabeth.<br> His Majesty has yet<br> to retire, Mr Greville.<br> I'm to leave tomorrow.<br> Yes.<br> You knew?<br> It's a pity. You seem<br> such a promising young man.<br> Could I, um...<br> Mr Greville, please.<br> But...when...<br> It was what was required,<br> Mr Greville. That was all.<br> (Outside) Sharp, sharp!<br> The king! The king!<br> Thank you, Thompson.<br> Madam...<br> When I was ill,<br> they tell me that<br> I said certain things.<br> I have no memory of them, sir.<br> Uh, it's not so much<br> what was said as what was done.<br> So...<br> Did we? Did we, uh...<br> Your Majesty?<br> Um, did we...<br> did-did, uh, did we ever<br> forget ourselves utterly,<br> because, if we did I should so<br> like to remember, what, what?<br> No, sir. Your behaviour<br> throughout was impeccable.<br> Hey, hey!<br> Like the kindest father,<br> as well as the most<br> generous of sovereigns.<br> Good, good.<br> Mrs King.<br> Mr King.<br> You're a good little pudding,<br> what, what?<br> It was said,<br> when you were ill, that...<br> if you had led a normal life,<br> this might not have happened.<br> A normal life?<br> Other women, sir.<br> Kicked over the traces,<br> you mean.<br> No life is without its regrets.<br> Yet none is without<br> its consolations.<br> You're a good<br> little woman, Mrs King.<br> And we have been happy,<br> have we not?<br> - Oh, yes, Mr King.<br> - And shall be again.<br> Your Majesty, I shall<br> be in the cathedral,<br> should the ceremony prove<br> to be too much of a burden.<br> You may tell Dr Willis<br> that the ceremony<br> will not be such a burden<br> as the want<br> of ceremony has been.<br> Presume not I am as I was.<br> I'm not the patient.<br> Be off with you.<br> Back to your sheep and pigs.<br> The king is himself again.<br> We must try to be<br> more of a family.<br> There are model farms now,<br> model villages,<br> even model factories.<br> Well, we must be a model family,<br> for the nation to look to.<br> Yes, you must try to<br> be more typical, Fred.<br> But, Pa, I want<br> something to do.<br> Do?<br> Well, follow in my footsteps.<br> That's what you should do.<br> Smile at the people,<br> wave to them.<br> Let them see that we're happy.<br> That is why we're here.<br>
