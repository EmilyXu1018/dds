                        The magnificence of the<br> Ambersons began in 1873<br> Their splendour lasted throughout<br> all the years that saw their<br> midland town spread and<br> darken into a city.<br> In that town, in those days,<br> all the women who wore silk or velvet<br> knew all the other women who wore<br> silk or velvet<br> and everybody knew everybody else's<br> family horse and carriage.<br> The only public advance was<br> the street car.<br> A lady could whistle to it from an upstairs<br> window<br> and the car would hold at once<br> and wait for her<br> while she shut her window, put on her hat<br> and coat, went downstairs, found an umbrella<br> told the girl what to have for dinner<br> and came forth from the house.<br> Too slow for us nowadays,<br> because the faster we are carried<br> the less time we have to spare.<br> During the earlier<br> years of this period<br> while bangs and bustles were<br> having their way with women,<br> there were seen men of<br> all ages to whom a hat<br> meant only that rigid<br> tall silk thing<br> known to impudents<br> as a "stove pipe."<br> But the long contagion of<br> the derby had arrived:<br> one season the crown of<br> this hat would be a bucket,<br> next it would be a spoon.<br> Every house still kept its<br> bootjack, but high top boots<br> gave way to shoes<br> and congress gaiters<br> and these were played through<br> fashions that shaped them now with<br> toes like box ends, and now with<br> toes like the prows of racing shells.<br> Trousers with a crease were<br> considered plebeian; the<br> crease proved that the garment<br> had lain upon a shelf,<br> and hence was ready-made.<br> With evening dress, a gentleman<br> wore a tan overcoat...so short that<br> his black coattails hung visible<br> But after a season or two<br> he lengthened his overcoat<br> till it touched his heels.<br> And he passed out of<br> his tight trousers<br> into trousers like great bags.<br> In those days,<br> they had time for everything:<br> time for sleigh rides, and balls,<br> and assemblies, and cotillions.<br> And open house on New Year's, and<br> all-day picnics in the woods.<br> And even that prettiest<br> of all vanished customs,<br> the serenade.<br> Of a summer night,<br> young men would bring an orchestra<br> under a pretty girl's window<br> a flute, harp, fiddle,<br> cello, coronet, bass viole,<br> would presently release their<br> melodies to the dulcet stars.<br> Against so home-spun a backdrop,<br> the magnificence of the Ambersons<br> was as conspicuous as a<br> brass band at a funeral.<br> There it is!<br> The Amberson mansion!<br> - The pride of the town!<br> - Well, well...<br> $60,000 for the woodwork alone!<br> - Hot and cold running water...<br> - Upstairs and down.<br> And stationary washstands in<br> every last bedroom in the place.<br> Is Miss Amberson at home?<br> No sir, Mr. Morgan.<br> Miss Amberson's not home.<br> Well, thanks Sam...<br> No sir, Miss Amberson ain't<br> home for you, Mr. Morgan.<br> Thanks.<br> - I guess she's still mad at him.<br> - Who?<br> - Isabel.<br> - Major Amberson's daughter.<br> Eugene Morgan's her best beau!<br> Took a bit too much to drink<br> the other night right out here,<br> - and stepped clean through the<br> bass fiddle that was serenadin' her!<br> - Well, well.<br> I haven't seen her since<br> she got back from abroad.<br> Isabel? Well sir, I don't know<br> as I know just how to put it,<br> but she's, she's kind of a,<br> delightful-looking young lady.<br> Wilbur? Wilbur Minafer?<br> I never thought he'd get her.<br> Well, whaddya know!<br> Well, Wilbur may not be<br> any Apollo, as it were,<br> but he's a steady young businessman.<br> Wilbur Minafer!<br> Looks like Isabel's pretty<br> sensible for such a showy girl.<br> - To think of her takin' him!<br> - Yes, just because a man any<br> woman would like a thousand times<br> better was a little wild one night<br> - at a serenade.<br> - What she minds was him makin' a<br> clown of himself in her own front yard.<br> Made her think he didn't<br> care much about her!<br> She's probably mistaken, but it's too<br> late for her to think anything else now.<br> The wedding will be a<br> big Amberson style thing...<br> Raw oysters floating in<br> scooped-out blocks of ice,<br> a band, from out of town,<br> and then Wilbur will take<br> Isabel on the carefullest little<br> wedding trip he can manage.<br> And she'll be a good wife<br> to him, but they'll have<br> the worst-spoiled lot of children<br> this town will ever see.<br> How on earth do you figure<br> that out, Mrs. Foster?<br> She couldn't love Wilbur, could she?<br> Well! It'll all go to her children.<br> And she'll ruin them.<br> The prophetess proved to be<br> mistaken in a single detail merely,<br> Wilbur and Isabel did not have<br> "children," they had only one.<br> Only one,<br> But I'd like to know if he isn't<br> spoiled enough for a whole carload!<br> Again, she found none to challenge her<br> and George Amberson Minafer,<br> the Major's one grandchild,<br> was a princely terror.<br> Hey! Go, I guess you<br> think you own this town?<br> There were people...grown<br> people they were,<br> who expressed themselves longingly.<br> They did hope to live to<br> see the day, they said,<br> when that boy would<br> get his come-uppance.<br> - His...what?<br> - His come-uppance.<br> Something's bound to<br> take him down some day.<br> I only want to be there!<br> Nah, the little girly-curly,<br> Nah, the little girly-curly,<br> Say Bob, where'd you steal<br> your mother's old sash?<br> Your sister stole it for me!<br> She stole it off our old<br> clothesline and gave it to me!<br> You go get your hair cut!<br> You and I haven't got any sister!<br> Yeah, I know you haven't at home.<br> I mean the one that's in jail!<br> I dare you to get out<br> of that pony cart!<br> I dare you outside that gate!<br> I dare ya half way here I dare ya!<br> Here I come, you...<br> Little boy!<br> Little boy!<br> That'll be enough of that!<br> You stop that, you!<br> I guess you don't know who I am!<br> Yes I do, and you're a<br> disgrace to your mother!<br> You shut up about my mother!<br> She outta be ashamed of a<br> bad little boy like you!<br> Be silent you billy goat, you!<br> Pull down your vest, and<br> wipe off your chin,<br> and go to hell!<br> What!<br> This was heard not only by myself,<br> but by my wife, and the<br> lady who lives next door.<br> He's an old liar.<br> Georgie...you mustn't say "liar."<br> Dear, did you say<br> what he says you did?<br> Well, first I wouldn't wipe a<br> shoe on that old storyteller...<br> Georgie, you mustn't!<br> - I mean none of us Amberson's<br> wouldn't have anything to do with him.<br> - That's not what we're talking about.<br> I'll bet if he wanted to see any of us,<br> he'd have to go around to the side door.<br> - No, you shouldn't say...<br> - Please, father!<br> Forgive me, he doesn't see a<br> very tactful person, but...<br> He's just...riff-raff!<br> Oh, you mustn't say so!<br> And you must promise me never<br> to use those bad words again.<br> I promise not to...<br> unless I get mad at somebody.<br> Wait'll they send him away to school.<br> Then he'll get it!<br> They'll knock the<br> stuffin' out of him!<br> But George returned with<br> the same stuffing.<br> Bloody siz! See here Bub, does<br> your mother know that you're out!<br> Turn down your pants,<br> you would-be dude!<br> When Mr. George Amberson<br> Minafer came home for the<br> holidays in his sophomore year,<br> Nothing about him<br> encouraged any hope<br> that he had received<br> his come-uppance.<br> Cards were out for a<br> ball in his honour.<br> And this pageant of the tenantry<br> was the last of the great<br> long-remembered dances<br> that everybody talked about.<br> Hello there...<br> ...that big bow window...<br> that's where they'll put the<br> Major when his time comes...<br> Now don't you look at<br> me like that, Major!<br> - Georgie! You look fine!<br> - Sam.<br> There was a time though in your<br> fourth month that you were so<br> puny, nobody thought you'd live!<br> - Where's Fanny?<br> - Know me very well indeed!<br> Isabel...<br> Eugene!<br> This your boy, Isabel?<br> - George, this is Mr. Morgan.<br> - Remember you very well indeed.<br> George, you never saw<br> me before in your life.<br> But from now on, you're<br> going to see a lot of me.<br> - I hope.<br> - I hope so too, Eugene.<br> Where's Wilbur?<br> You'll find him<br> in the game room<br> with some of the others.<br> He never was much for<br> parties, remember?<br> Yes, I remember.<br> I'll come back for a dance.<br> Please do.<br> - Eugene Morgan, Major Amberson.<br> - Well, well, well...<br> Remember you very well indeed.<br> Remember you very well indeed.<br> Miss Morgan.<br> (Jeeve!)<br> Remember you very well indeed!<br> You don't remember her either,<br> Georgie. But of course you will.<br> Miss Morgan's from out of town.<br> You might take her up to the<br> dancing, I think you've pretty<br> well done your duty here.<br> Be delighted.<br> - What did you say your name was?<br> - Morgan.<br> (Oh, well, I'm certainly<br> glad you're back.)<br> (It's nice to be back too,<br> Jack. It's been a long time.)<br> Who's that?<br> Oh, I didn't catch his name when<br> my mother presented him to me.<br> You mean the queer-looking duck?<br> - The who?<br> - The queer-looking duck.<br> Oh, I wouldn't say that.<br> The one with him<br> is my Uncle Jack.<br> Honourable Jack Amberson.<br> I thought everybody knew him.<br> He looks as though everybody<br> ought to know him. Seems to<br> run in your family.<br> Well, I suppose almost everybody<br> does know him. Out in this part<br> of the country especially.<br> - Uncle Jack's pretty well-known.<br> He's a congressman, you know.<br> - Oh, really?<br> Oh, yes. The family always liked<br> to have somebody in Congress.<br> It's sort of a good<br> thing, in one way.<br> - Hello, Lucy!<br> - Hello!<br> How do all these ducks<br> get to know you so quick?<br> Oh, I've been here a week.<br> Seems to me you've<br> been pretty busy!<br> - Most of these...<br> - Hello, Lucy!<br> - Hello!<br> Most of these ducks, I don't<br> know what my mother invited<br> them here for, anyway.<br> Don't you like them?<br> Oh I used to be president<br> of a club we had here and<br> some of them belonged to it.<br> But I don't care much for<br> that sort of thing anymore.<br> I really don't see why<br> my mother invited 'em.<br> Maybe she didn't want to<br> offend their fathers and mothers.<br> I hardly think that my mother<br> need worry about offending<br> anybody in this old town.<br> Must be wonderful, Mr.<br> Amberson. Mr. Minafer, I mean.<br> - What must be wonderful?<br> - To be so important as that.<br> - Oh, that isn't important.<br> - (Good evening.)<br> - Good evening.<br> Anybody that really is anybody oughta<br> be able to do about as they like in<br> their own town, I should think.<br> - Hello!<br> - Well! How's that for a bit<br> of freshness!<br> - What was?<br> - That queer-looking duck<br> waving his hand at me like that.<br> He meant me!<br> Oh, he did?<br> Everybody seems to mean you!<br> - See here, are you<br> engaged to anybody?<br> - No!<br> You certainly seem to<br> know a good many people!<br> Papa does. He used to live<br> in this town before I was born.<br> - Where do you live now?<br> - We've lived all over.<br> What do you keep moving around<br> so for? Is he a...promoter?<br> No, he's an inventor.<br> Oh? What's he invented?<br> - Georgie.<br> - Grandfather.<br> Just lately he's been working on<br> a new kind of horseless carriage.<br> Horseless carri...automobile?<br> Well, well.<br> Don't you approve of<br> them, Mr. Minafer?<br> Oh, yes...they're all right.<br> You know, I'm just<br> beginning to understand.<br> Understand what? What?<br> What it means to be a real<br> Amberson in this town.<br> Papa told me something about<br> it before we came, but I see<br> he didn't say half enough.<br> Did your father say he knew<br> the family before he left here?<br> I don't think he meant<br> to boast of it. He spoke<br> of it quite calmly.<br> Most girls are<br> usually pretty fresh.<br> They oughta go to a man's college<br> for about a year. Men get taught<br> a few things about freshness.<br> Look here, who sent<br> you those flowers<br> you keep making<br> such a fuss over?<br> - Lucy.<br> - He did.<br> - Who's he?<br> - The queer-looking duck.<br> - I've come for that dance!<br> Oh, him...I suppose<br> he's some old widower.<br> Heh; some old widower!<br> Yes, he is a widower!<br> I ought to have told you before.<br> He's my father.<br> Oh.<br> Well that's a horse on me.<br> If I'd known he was your...<br> This is our dance.<br> But I guess I won't insist on it.<br> George, dear; are you<br> enjoying the party?<br> Yes mother, very much.<br> Will you please excuse us?<br> Miss Morgan...<br> Eggnog, anybody?<br> Not for me, sir.<br> I see that you kept<br> your promise, Gene.<br> Isabel, I remember the<br> last drink Gene ever had.<br> Fact is, I believe if he<br> hadn't broken that bass fiddle,<br> Isabel never would have taken Wilbur.<br> Heh, what do you think, Wilbur?<br> I shouldn't be surprised.<br> If your notion's right, I'm<br> glad Gene broke the fiddle.<br> What do you say about it, Isabel?<br> By Jingo! She's blushing!<br> Who wouldn't blush?<br> The important thing is<br> that Wilbur did get her,<br> and not only got her,<br> but kept her.<br> There's another important<br> thing...that is, for me.<br> In fact, it's the only thing<br> that makes me forgive that bass<br> viole for getting in my way.<br> - Well, what's that?<br> - Lucy.<br> You havin' a good time?<br> I don't suppose you<br> ever gave up smoking...<br> No, sir.<br> Well, I've got some Havanas.<br> Your ears don't burn, young lady?<br> - Would you care for some<br> refreshments, Miss Morgan?<br> - Yes, thanks.<br> What did you say your name was?<br> Morgan.<br> Funny name...<br> Everybody else's name always is.<br> I didn't mean it was really funny.<br> That's just one of the crowd's<br> bits of horsing in college.<br> I knew your last name was Morgan.<br> I meant your first name.<br> - Lucy.<br> - Well!<br> Is "Lucy" a funny name, too?<br> - No...Lucy's very much all right.<br> - Thanks.<br> Here they are. Here<br> they are, Henry.<br> - Are they?<br> - Thanks for what?<br> Thanks about letting<br> my name be Lucy.<br> Good-bye. I've got<br> this dance with her.<br> - With who?<br> - With Isabel, of course.<br> Tell me, have you danced with<br> poor old Fanny too, this evening?<br> Twice. Wilbur...<br> My gosh, old times certainly<br> are starting all over again...<br> Not a bit! There aren't any<br> old times. When times are gone<br> they aren't old - they're dead.<br> There aren't any<br> times but new times!<br> - What are you studying in school?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - What are you studying in school?<br> - College.<br> - College.<br> Oh, lots of useless guff.<br> Why don't you study<br> some useful guff?<br> What do you mean "useful?"<br> Something you can use later<br> in your business or profession.<br> I don't intend to go into<br> any business or profession.<br> - No?<br> - No!<br> Why not?<br> Well...just look at them.<br> That's a fine career<br> for a man, isn't it?<br> Lawyers, bankers, politicians!<br> What do they ever get out<br> of life, I'd like to know?<br> What they know about real things?<br> Where do they ever get?<br> What do you want to be?<br> A yachtsman.<br> - What good are they?<br> They always break down!<br> - They do not always break down!<br> Oh, of course they do!<br> - Horseless carriages! Automobiles!<br> - Hmm?<br> People aren't going to spend their<br> lives lying on their backs in the road<br> letting grease drip on their faces.<br> No, I think your father<br> better forget about them.<br> Papa would be so grateful if<br> he could have your advice.<br> I don't know that I've done<br> anything to be insulted for.<br> You know, I don't mind your<br> being such a lofty person at all.<br> I think it's ever so interesting.<br> But Papa's a great man.<br> Is he? Well let us hope so.<br> I hope so, I'm sure.<br> Hoe lovely your mother is!<br> I think she is.<br> She's the gracefullest woman.<br> She dances like a girl of 16.<br> Most girls of 16 are<br> pretty bad dancers.<br> Anyhow,<br> I wouldn't dance with one<br> of them unless I had to.<br> Uh, the snow's fine for sleighing.<br> I'll be by for you in a cutter,<br> ten minutes after two.<br> - Tomorrow?<br> - (Thank you, Isabel.)<br> - I can't possibly go...<br> - Bravo! Bravisimo!<br> - Papa.<br> - Lucy.<br> I'll get your things.<br> If you don't I'm going to sit<br> in a cutter at your front gate,<br> and if you go out with<br> anybody else, he has to whip<br> me before he gets to you.<br> Hey, you two, I think you oughta<br> take this, in case you break down<br> in that...horseless carriage!<br> - Uncle Jack!<br> - Take this scarf, mistress.<br> - Good night, Isabel.<br> - Come here.<br> Fanny, where are you going?<br> Oh, just out to look.<br> Think you'll be warm enough,<br> Lucy? Here, put this scarf on.<br> - Well?<br> - (I will)<br> - Oh, nothing...<br> Here, hold this.<br> Who is this fellow, Morgan?<br> I...he's a man with a<br> pretty daughter, Georgie.<br> He certainly seems to be<br> awfully at home, here.<br> The way he was dancing with<br> Mother and aunt Fanny.<br> Well, I'm afraid your aunt<br> Fanny's heart was stirred by<br> Ancient recollections, Georgie.<br> You mean she used to<br> be silly about him?<br> Oh, she wasn't considered,<br> er, singular.<br> - He was...he was popular.<br> - Ohh...<br> Do you take the same passionate<br> interest in the parents of<br> every girl you dance with?<br> Oh, dry up! I only<br> wanted to know...<br> Lucy...about that sleigh ride...<br> Don't go out with anybody.<br> - I want to look at that automobile<br> carriage of yours, Gene.<br> - Fanny, you'll catch cold.<br> - I want to ride in that thing<br> tomorrow, want to see if it's safe.<br> - Good night, Isabel.<br> - Good night, Eugene.<br> - Got a blanket for<br> you here, Jeeves. Catch!<br> - Night!<br> - Bye! Bye!<br> Papa? Papa? Do you think<br> George is terrible arrogant<br> and domineering?<br> Oh, he's still only a boy.<br> Plenty of fine stuff in him.<br> Can't help but be, he's...<br> Isabel Amberson's son.<br> You liked her pretty<br> well once I guess, Papa.<br> Do still.<br> ...I know that isn't<br> all that's worrying you.<br> Well, several things.<br> I've been a little bothered<br> about your father, too.<br> Why?<br> It seems to me<br> he looks so badly.<br> He isn't any different<br> than the way he's looked<br> all his life that I can see.<br> He's been worried about some<br> investments he made last year.<br> I think the worry's<br> affected his health.<br> What investments?<br> See here, he isn't going into<br> Morgan's automobile concern, is he?<br> Oh, no. The automobile<br> concern is all Eugene's.<br> No, your father's rolling mills...<br> Hello, dear.<br> Have you had trouble sleeping?<br> Look here, Father...<br> about this man Morgan and<br> his old sewing machine.<br> Didn't he want to get grandfather<br> to put some money into it?<br> Isn't that what he's up to?<br> You little silly! What on<br> earth are you talking about?<br> Eugene Morgan's perfectly able to<br> finance his own inventions these days.<br> I'll bet he borrows<br> money from Uncle Jack.<br> Georgie, why do you say such a thing?<br> Just strikes me as that sort<br> of a man. Isn't he, Father?<br> He was a fairly wild young<br> fellow twenty years ago.<br> He's like you in one thing, Georgie.<br> He spent too much money. Only<br> he didn't have a mother<br> to get money out of a<br> grandfather for him.<br> But I believe he's done<br> fairly well of late years,<br> and I doubt if he needs anyone else's<br> money to back his horseless carriage.<br> Oh what's he brought the<br> old thing here for, then?<br> I'm sure I don't know.<br> You might ask him.<br> I'll be in to say goodnight, dear.<br> Aunt Fanny.<br> What in the world's<br> the matter with you?<br> I suppose you don't know why<br> Father doesn't want to go on that<br> horseless carriage trip tomorrow?<br> What do you mean?<br> You're his only sister<br> and yet you don't know.<br> H-he never wants to go<br> anywhere that I ever heard of.<br> What is the matter with you?<br> He doesn't want to go because<br> he doesn't like this man Morgan.<br> Oh, good gracious!<br> Eugene Morgan isn't in<br> your Father's thoughts at<br> all one way or the other.<br> - 'Night.<br> - Why should he be?<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> You two at it again?<br> Hey, what makes you and everybody<br> so excited over this man Morgan.<br> - This man Morgan.<br> - Excited!<br> - Oh, shut up!<br> Can't...can't people be glad<br> to see an old friend without<br> silly children like you<br> making a to-do about it?<br> I...I've just been suggesting<br> to your mother that she might<br> give a little dinner for them.<br> For who?<br> - "For whom", Georgie.<br> - "For whom, Georgie."<br> For Mr. Morgan and his daughter.<br> Oh, look here; don't do that.<br> Mother mustn't do that.<br> "Mother mustn't do that."<br> - It wouldn't look well.<br> - "Wouldn't look..."<br> See here, George Minafer...<br> I suggest<br> that you just march<br> straight on into your room!<br> Sometimes you say things that show<br> you have a pretty mean little mind!<br> What upset you this much?<br> - (Shut up!)<br> - I know what you mean!<br> You're trying to insinuate that<br> I'd get your mother to invite<br> Eugene Morgan here on my account!<br> (I'm gonna move to a hotel!)<br> Because he's a widower.<br> - What?<br> - What!<br> - Huh huh huh<br> - "Heh heh heh heh heh"<br> I'm trying to insinuate you're<br> setting your cap for him,<br> and getting Mother to help you?<br> - Ohh!<br> - Is that what you mean?<br> You attend your own affairs!<br> Well! I will be shot!<br> I will.<br> - I certainly will be shot.<br> - (Oh!)<br> - Ohh.<br> You think you'll get it to start?<br> What's wrong with it, Gene?<br> I wish I knew!<br> Get a horse!<br> Get a horse!<br> - Look out, Lucy!<br> - What happened to them?<br> - Oh, George!<br> - Don't get excited, Isabel.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - (Georgie!)<br> They're all right, Isabel.<br> The snow bank's a feather bed.<br> - Georgie!<br> - Lucy dear!<br> - Oh, I'm fine, Papa.<br> - Nothing's the matter with them now.<br> - They're all right, Isabel.<br> Are you sure you're<br> not hurt, Lucy dear?<br> - Don't make a fuss, mother.<br> - Georgie, that terrible fall.<br> Please Mother, please!<br> I'm all right.<br> Are you sure, Georgie? Sometimes<br> one doesn't realize...the shock.<br> - Oh, Isabel.<br> - I've just got to be sure, dear.<br> - Everything's all right,<br> Mother. Nothing's the matter.<br> - Let me brush you off, dear.<br> - You looked pretty surprised,<br> Lucy. All that snow becomes you!<br> - That's right, it does!<br> That darned horse!<br> He'll be home long before we will.<br> All we've got to depend on<br> is Gene Morgan's broken down...<br> - She'll go.<br> - Come on, asshole!<br> - All aboard!<br> Have to sit on my lap, Lucy!<br> Stamp the snow. You<br> mustn't ride with wet feet.<br> They're not wet.<br> - For goodness sake, get in; you're<br> standing in the snow yourself.<br> - Get in!<br> You're the same Isabel I used to know.<br> You're a divine and ridiculous woman.<br> George, you'll push if we<br> get started, won't you?<br> Push!<br> Divine and ridiculous just<br> counterbalance each other, don't they?<br> Plus one and minus<br> one equal nothing.<br> So you mean I'm nothing in particular?<br> No, that doesn't seem to<br> be precisely what I meant.<br> Jack, please get...<br> - We're under way...<br> - ...For fear of accident.<br> Push, Georgie; push!<br> I'm pushing.<br> Push harder!<br> Push, Georgie; push!<br> What do you think I'm doing?<br> Your father wanted to prove<br> that a horseless carriage<br> would run even in the snow.<br> It really does too, you<br> know. It's so interesting.<br> He says he's going to have<br> wheels all made of rubber,<br> and blown up with air. I<br> should think they'd explode,<br> But Eugene seems<br> very confident that...<br> Oh, it seems so like old<br> times to hear him talk.<br> "You broke the bank at<br> Monte Carlo..."<br> Hooray; we're off!<br> George, you tried to<br> swing underneath me<br> and break the fall for<br> me when we went over.<br> I knew you were doing<br> that. It was nice of you.<br> Wasn't much of a fall to<br> speak of. How about that kiss?<br> You will hear them sigh<br> and wish to die<br> and see 'em wink the other eye, the<br> man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo.<br> As I walked along<br> the Bois de Boulogne with<br> an independent air...<br> Wilbur Minafer,<br> quiet man.<br> Town will hardly know he's gone.<br> Where did Isabel go to?<br> She was tired.<br> Never was becoming to<br> her to look pale.<br> Look out.<br> Oh, boy...<br> - Strawberry shortcake!<br> - It's the first this season.<br> I hope it's big enough.<br> - You must know I'm coming home.<br> - Mmm.<br> What did you say?<br> Nothing.<br> - Sweet enough?<br> - Fine.<br> I suppose your mother's been...<br> pretty gay at the commencement.<br> Going a lot?<br> How could she, she's in mourning.<br> All she could do was sit<br> around and look on.<br> - That's all Lucy could<br> do really, for that matter.<br> - How did Lucy get home?<br> On the train; we rushed over.<br> Quit balling your food.<br> Did you drive out to their house<br> with her before you came here?<br> No.<br> She went home with her father.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Don't eat so fast, George.<br> So, ah...<br> Eugene came to the station to meet you?<br> Meet us?<br> How could he?<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> Want some more milk?<br> No, thanks.<br> I haven't seen him while<br> your mother's been away.<br> Naturally; he's beneath himself.<br> Did you see him?<br> Naturally, since he made<br> the trip home with us.<br> He did? He was with<br> you all the time?<br> Un-uh. Only on the train, in the<br> last three day before we left.<br> Uncle Jack got him to come along.<br> You're gonna get fat.<br> Mm, I can't help that.<br> You're such a wonderful housekeeper.<br> - You certainly know how to<br> make things taste good.<br> - Mmmm.<br> I don't think you'd stay single<br> very long if some of these bachelors<br> - or widowers around<br> town for just one...<br> - It's a little odd.<br> What's odd?<br> Your mother's not mentioning<br> that Mr. Morgan had been with you.<br> Didn't think of it, I suppose.<br> - But I'll tell you<br> something in confidence...<br> - What?<br> Well it struck me that<br> Mr. Morgan looked pretty<br> absent-minded most of the time.<br> And he's certainly dressing<br> better than he used to.<br> Oh he...he's isn't dressing<br> better, he's dressing up.<br> Fanny, you oughta be a<br> little encouraging when a<br> prized bachelor begins to<br> show by his haberdashery<br> what he wants you to think about him.<br> Jacks tells me that the<br> factory's been doing quite well.<br> - Quite well?<br> - Honestly, Aunt Fanny...<br> - Why listen, you changed that...<br> I shouldn't be a bit surprised<br> to have him request an interview<br> and declare that his<br> intentions are honourable.<br> And ask my permission to<br> pay his addresses to you.<br> What had I better tell him?<br> Oh, Aunt Fanny.<br> - Oh, Fanny, we were only teasing.<br> - Oh, let me alone!<br> - Please, Fanny.<br> - We didn't mean anything.<br> - Let go of me! Please!<br> - I didn't know you'd got<br> so sensitive as all this.<br> - Please, let me alone!<br> It's getting so you can't joke<br> with her about anything anymore.<br> It all began when we found out<br> that Father's estate was all washed<br> up and he didn't leave anything.<br> I thought she'd fell better when<br> we turned over his insurance to her.<br> Gave it to her absolutely<br> without any strings to it.<br> But, now...I dunno...<br> Yeah.<br> I think maybe we've been...<br> teasing her about the wrong things.<br> Fanny hasn't got much in her life.<br> You know George, just<br> being an aunt isn't...<br> really the great career it<br> may sometimes seem to be.<br> I really don't know of<br> anything much Fanny has got.<br> Except her feeling about Eugene.<br> We're now turning out a<br> car and a quarter a day.<br> - Isn't that marvelous?<br> - What's marvelous?<br> They're turning out a<br> car and a quarter a day.<br> Mother...<br> All this noise and smell<br> seems to be good for you.<br> You oughta come here every<br> time you get the blues.<br> She never gets the blues, George.<br> I never knew a person of<br> a more even disposition.<br> - No, it's this place.<br> - I wish I could be more like that.<br> Wouldn't anybody be delighted<br> to see an old friend take an<br> idea out of the air like that? An<br> idea most people laughed at him for.<br> And turn it to such a splendid<br> humming thing as this factory.<br> Do you remember this?<br> Our first machine.<br> The original Morgan Invincible.<br> I remember.<br> How quaint!<br> Of course I'm happy...<br> - so very, very happy.<br> - Just look at the Morgan<br> now, Mrs. Minafer.<br> It's beautiful.<br> Just beautiful.<br> Did you ever see<br> anything so lovely?<br> - As what?<br> - As you mother. She's a darling!<br> And Papa looks as if he<br> were either going to explode,<br> or to utter loud sobs.<br> It's just glorious.<br> It makes us all happy, Eugene.<br> Give him your hand, Fanny.<br> There. If brother Jack were here,<br> Eugene would have his three<br> oldest and best friends<br> congratulating him all at once.<br> We know what brother Jack<br> thinks about it, though.<br> I used to write verse<br> about 20 years ago,<br> - remember that?<br> - I remember that, too.<br> I'm almost thinking<br> I could do it again...<br> to thank you for making a factory<br> visit into such a kind celebration.<br> Isabel, dear...<br> Yes, Eugene.<br> Don't you think you<br> should tell George?<br> - About us?<br> - Yes.<br> There's still time.<br> I think he should hear it from you.<br> He will, dearest.<br> Soon...<br> Soon.<br> I'll still take a horse any day.<br> - Wo.<br> - Oh, don't.<br> - Why?<br> Do you want him to<br> trot his legs off?<br> - No, but...<br> - "No but" what?<br> I know when you make him walk<br> it's so you can give all your<br> attention to proposing to me again.<br> - George, do let Pendennis trot again.<br> - I won't.<br> Get up, Pendennis. Go<br> on, trot! Commence!<br> Ah, Lucy,<br> if you aren't the prettiest<br> thing in this world.<br> When are you going to<br> say we're really engaged?<br> Not for years. So<br> there's the answer.<br> Lucy!<br> Dear, what's the matter?<br> You look as if you're going to cry.<br> You always do that, whenever I can<br> get you to talk about marrying me.<br> - I know it.<br> - Well why do you?<br> One reason's because...I have<br> a feeling it's never going to be.<br> - You haven't any reason or...<br> - It's just a feeling.<br> I don't know...<br> Everything's so unsettled.<br> If you aren't the queerest<br> girl. What's unsettled?<br> Well for one thing, George,<br> you haven't decided on<br> anything to do yet.<br> Or at least if you have,<br> you've never spoken of it.<br> Lucy, haven't you perfectly<br> well understood that I don't<br> intend to go into a business<br> or adopt a profession?<br> Well what are you going to do, George?<br> Why, I expect to lead<br> an honorable life.<br> I expect to contribute my<br> share to charities,<br> and take part in,<br> well in, movements.<br> - What kind?<br> - Whatever appeals to me.<br> I should like to revert to the<br> questions I was asking you,<br> - if you don't mind.<br> - No, George...<br> - I think you'd better...<br> - Your father's a businessman<br> - He's a mechanical genius.<br> - It is your father's idea...<br> - Or he's both.<br> isn't it your father's idea that I<br> ought to go into business and you<br> oughtn't to be engaged to me until I do?<br> No, I've never once<br> spoken to him about it.<br> But you know that's the<br> way he does feel about it?<br> Yes.<br> Do you think that I'd be<br> very much of a man if I let<br> another man dictate to<br> me my own way of life?<br> George! Who's dictating<br> your way of life?<br> I don't believe in the whole<br> world...scrubbing dishes,<br> selling potatoes or<br> trying law cases.<br> No, I dare say I don't care<br> any more for your father's<br> ideals than he does for mine.<br> - George?<br> - Giddap, Pendennis!<br> Well, seems to have recovered.<br> Looks the highest good spirits.<br> - I beg pardon?<br> - Your grandson.<br> Last night he seemed<br> inclined to melancholy.<br> What about?<br> Not getting remorseful about all the<br> money he spent in college, is he?<br> - I wonder what he thinks I'm made of.<br> - Gold.<br> And he's right about<br> that part of you, Father.<br> - What part?<br> - Your heart.<br> I suppose that may account<br> for how heavy it feels<br> nowadays, sometimes.<br> This town seems to be<br> rolling right over<br> that old heart you<br> mentioned just now, Jack.<br> Rolling over it and<br> burying it under.<br> - I miss my best girl.<br> - We all do.<br> Lucy's on a visit, father. She's<br> spending a week with a school friend.<br> She'll be back Monday.<br> George, how does it happen<br> you didn't tell us before?<br> You never said a word to<br> us about Lucy's going away.<br> Probably afraid to.<br> He didn't know that what<br> he might break down and cry<br> if he tried to speak of it.<br> Isn't that so, Georgie?<br> - Or didn't Lucy tell you she was going?<br> - She told me.<br> At any rate, Georgie didn't approve.<br> I suppose you two aren't speaking again?<br> Gene, what's this I hear<br> about someone else opening up<br> another horseless carriage<br> shop, somewhere<br> - out in the suburbs?<br> - Ah, I suppose they'll<br> drive you out of business,<br> or else the two of you'll get together and<br> drive all the rest of us off of the streets!<br> Well, we'll even things up by<br> making the streets bigger.<br> Automobiles will carry our streets<br> clear out to the county line.<br> Well I hope you're wrong, because<br> if people go to moving that far,<br> real estate values here in<br> the old residence part of town<br> will be stretched pretty thin.<br> So your devilish machines are going<br> to ruin all your old friends, eh Gene?<br> You really think they're going<br> to change the face of the land?<br> They're already doing it, Major,<br> and it can't be stopped.<br> - Automobiles are...<br> - Automobiles are a useless nuisance.<br> What did you say George?<br> I said automobiles are<br> a useless nuisance.<br> Nothing amount to anything<br> but a nuisance, and they had<br> no business to be invented.<br> Course you forget<br> Mr. Morgan makes them.<br> Also did his share in inventing them.<br> If you weren't so thoughtless, he<br> might think you rather offensive.<br> I'm not sure that George<br> is wrong about automobiles.<br> With all their speed forward, they<br> may be a step backward in civilization.<br> May be that they won't add<br> to the beauty of the world,<br> or the life of men's souls.<br> I'm not sure.<br> But automobiles have come.<br> And almost all outward things<br> are going to be different<br> because of what they bring.<br> They're going to alter war and<br> they're going to alter peace.<br> And I think men's minds are going<br> to be changed in subtle ways<br> because of automobiles.<br> And it may be that George is right.<br> Maybe, that in<br> we can see the inward change<br> in men by that time,<br> I shouldn't be able to defend<br> the gasoline engine, but would<br> have to agree with George,<br> that automobiles had no business<br> to be invented.<br> Well Major,<br> if you'll excuse me. Fanny.<br> - Oh Eugene, ple...<br> - Isabel.<br> Got to run down to the shop<br> and speak to the foreman.<br> - I'll see you to the door.<br> - Don't bother sir, I know the way.<br> I'll come to.<br> - Georgie dear, what did you mean?<br> - Just what I said.<br> He was hurt.<br> I...don't see why he should be.<br> I didn't say anything about him.<br> Didn't seem to me to be hurt,<br> he seemed perfectly cheerful.<br> What made you think he was hurt?<br> I know him.<br> - By Jove, Georgie; you are a puzzle!<br> - In what way, may I ask?<br> Well, it's a new style, courting<br> a pretty girl I must say for a<br> young fellow to go deliberately<br> out of his way to try and<br> make an enemy of her father,<br> by attacking his businesses!<br> By Jove!<br> It's a new way of winning a woman.<br> George!<br> You struck just the right<br> treatment to adopt, you're<br> doing just the right thing.<br> - Oh, what do you want?<br> - Her father would thank you if<br> he could see what you're doing.<br> Quit the mysterious detective<br> business. You make me dizzy.<br> You don't care to hear that I<br> approve of what you're doing?<br> For the gosh sakes, what in<br> the world is wrong with you?<br> Oh, you're always picking on me, always<br> - Ever since you were a little boy!<br> - Oh my gosh!<br> You wouldn't treat anybody in the<br> world like this except old Fanny!<br> "Old Fanny", you'd say, "It's nobody<br> but old Fanny, so I'll kick her."<br> "Nobody'll resent it, so<br> I'll kick her all I want to."<br> And you're right. I haven't got<br> anything in the world since my<br> brother died. Nobody, nothing...<br> - Oh my gosh!<br> - I never never in the world<br> would have told you about it,<br> or even made the faintest reference<br> to it if I hadn't seen<br> that somebody else had told you<br> - or you found out for<br> yourself in some way.<br> - Somebody else had told me what?<br> How people are talking about your mother.<br> What did you say?<br> Of course, I understood what<br> you were doing when you<br> started being rude to Eugene.<br> I knew you'd give Lucy up in a<br> minute if it came to a question<br> of your mother's reputation.<br> - Look here!<br> - Because you said...<br> - Look here! Just what do you mean?<br> I only wanted to say that I'm<br> sorry for you, George, that's all.<br> But it's only old Fanny,<br> so whatever she says,<br> pick on her for it.<br> Hammer her! Hammer her...<br> - Jack said...<br> - It's only poor old lonely Fanny!<br> Uncle Jack said if there was<br> any gossip it was about you!<br> He said people might be laughing<br> about the way you ran<br> after Morgan, but that was all!<br> Oh yes, it's always Fanny!<br> - Ridiculous old Fanny! Always! Always!<br> - Listen!<br> You said mother let him come here just<br> on your account, and now you say...<br> He did! Anyhow, he liked to<br> dance with me. He danced with me<br> as much as he did with her.<br> You told me mother never saw him<br> except when she was chaperoning you.<br> Well you don't suppose that<br> stops people from talking, do you?<br> They just thought I didn't count!<br> "It's only Fanny Minafer",<br> I suppose they'd say.<br> Besides, everybody knew<br> he'd been engaged to her.<br> - What's that?<br> - Everybody knows it. Everybody<br> in this town knows that<br> Isabel never really cared<br> for any other man in her life.<br> I believe I'm going crazy.<br> You mean you lied when you<br> told me there wasn't any talk?<br> Oh it never would have amounted<br> to anything if Wilbur had lived.<br> You mean Morgan might have married you?<br> No.<br> Because I don't know that<br> I'd have accepted him.<br> Are you trying to tell me<br> that because he comes here<br> and they see her with him,<br> driving and all that,<br> they think that they were right<br> in saying that she was...<br> she was in love with him before...<br> before my father died?<br> Why, George!<br> Don't you know that's what they say?<br> You must know that everybody in town...<br> - Who told you?<br> - What?<br> Who told you there was talk?<br> Where is this talk? Where does<br> it come from? Who does it!<br> Why, I suppose pretty much everybody<br> I know. It's pretty general.<br> - Who said so?<br> - Wha?<br> - How did you get hold<br> of it? You answer me!<br> - Well I hardly think it<br> would be fair to give names.<br> - Look here.<br> One of your best friends<br> is that mother of Charlie<br> Johnson's across the way.<br> - Has she ever mentioned this to you?<br> - Well she may have intimated it...<br> - You and she have been<br> talking about it! Do you deny it?<br> - Why George...<br> - Do you deny it?<br> - She's a very kind discreet<br> woman, but she may have intimated...<br> George!<br> What are you going to do, George?<br> Mr. Amberson...<br> Heh heh, I mean Mr. Minafer.<br> - Won't you come in, please.<br> - Thank you.<br> Well! How nice to<br> see you, Mr. Minafer.<br> Mrs. Johnson...<br> Mrs. Johnson, I have come<br> to ask you a few questions.<br> Certainly, Mr. Minafer,<br> anything I can do for you.<br> I don't mean to waste<br> any time, Mrs. Johnson.<br> You...you were talking<br> about a...a scandal<br> that involved my mother's name!<br> Mr. Minafer!<br> My aunt told me that you<br> repeated the scandal to her.<br> I don't think your aunt<br> can have said that.<br> We may have discussed some<br> few matters that have been a<br> topic of comment about town.<br> - Yes, I think you may have!<br> - Other people may be less considerate.<br> Other people! That's what I want<br> to know about! These other people,<br> - how many? How many?<br> - What?<br> How many other people talk about it?<br> Heh, really, this isn't a courtroom.<br> - And I'm not a defendant in a libel suit.<br> - You may be!<br> I want to know just who dared to<br> say these things if I have to force<br> my way into every house in town.<br> - I mean to know just who told you these...<br> - You mean to know!<br> Well you'll know<br> something pretty quick!<br> You'll know that you're<br> out in the street!<br> Please to leave my house!<br> Oh...now you have done it!<br> What have I done that wasn't<br> honourable and right?<br> You think these riff-raff<br> can go around town bandying<br> my mother's good name?<br> They can now!<br> Georgie, gossip's never<br> fail till it's denied.<br> - Well if you think I'm gonna<br> let my mother's good name...<br> - Good name!<br> Nobody has a good name and a bad mouth!<br> Nobody has a good name and<br> a...silly mouth, either.<br> Didn't you understand me when<br> I told you people are saying my<br> mother means to marry this man?<br> - Yes, yes, I understood you.<br> - Great gosh!<br> You think of it so calmly!<br> - Why shouldn't they<br> marry if they want to?<br> - Why shouldn't they!<br> - It's their own affair!<br> - Why shouldn't they!<br> - Yes! Why shouldn't they!<br> Oh that you can sit there and<br> speak of it! Your own sister!<br> Oh, for heaven's sake!<br> Don't be so theatrical.<br> Come back here!<br> Needn't mind, Mary.<br> I'll see who it is and what they want.<br> Probably it's only a peddler.<br> Thank you, Mr. George.<br> Good afternoon, George.<br> Your mother expects to go<br> driving with me, I believe.<br> You'll be so kind as to<br> send her word I'm here.<br> No.<br> - I beg your pardon, I said...<br> - I heard you.<br> You say that you had an engagement<br> with my mother, and I said no.<br> What's the matter?<br> My mother will have no interest in<br> knowing that you came here today.<br> Or any other day.<br> I'm afraid I don't understand you.<br> It doubt if I can make it<br> much plainer, but I'll try.<br> You're not wanted in<br> this house, Mr. Morgan.<br> Now or at any other time.<br> Perhaps you'll understand this!<br> - Isabel.<br> - Yes.<br> - I've just come from Eugene.<br> - Yes?<br> I want to talk to you.<br> Well!<br> I can just guess what that was about!<br> He's telling her what<br> you did to Eugene!<br> - You go back to your room!<br> - You're not going in there!<br> - You go back to your room.<br> - George!<br> George! No you don't, Georgie Minafer!<br> - You keep away from here!<br> - You let go of me!<br> - I won't!<br> - Stop taking ahold of me!<br> - Hush up!<br> Go on to the top of<br> the stairs! Go on!<br> It's indecent!<br> Like squabbling outside the<br> door of an operating room!<br> The idea of you going in there now!<br> Jack's telling Isabel the whole thing.<br> Now you stay here and let him tell her!<br> He's got some consideration for her!<br> - I suppose you think I haven't?<br> - You, considerate of anybody!<br> - I'm considerate of her good name!<br> - Ahh!<br> Look here, seems to me you're<br> taking a pretty different tack!<br> I thought you already<br> knew everything I did!<br> I was...suffering, so I<br> wanted to let out a little.<br> Oh, I was a fool!<br> Eugene never would have looked at me,<br> even if he had never seen Isabel.<br> And they haven't done any harm.<br> She made...Wilbur happy.<br> She was a true wife to him,<br> for as long as he lived.<br> I...Here I go...not doing<br> myself a bit of good by...<br> And just ruining them.<br> You told me how all the riff-raff<br> in town were busy with her name,<br> - and the minute I lift my hand to<br> protect her, you attack me and...<br> - Shhh!<br> Your uncle's leaving.<br> I'll be back, Isabel.<br> George! Let her alone!<br> She's down there by<br> herself. Don't go down.<br> Let her alone!<br> Dearest one,<br> Yesterday I though the time had come<br> when I could ask you to marry me.<br> And you were dear enough to tell me,<br> sometime it might come to that.<br> But now we're faced,<br> not with slander,<br> and not with our own fear of<br> it, because we haven't any.<br> But someone else's fear of it.<br> Your son's.<br> Oh, dearest woman in the world,<br> I know what your son is to you,<br> and it frightens me.<br> Let me explain a little.<br> I don't think he'll change.<br> At 21 or 22, so many things appear<br> solid and permanent and terrible,<br> which 40 sees in nothing<br> but disappearing miasma.<br> by getting to be 40.<br> And so we come to this, dear:<br> will you live your life your way?<br> Or George's way?<br> Dear, it breaks my heart for you,<br> but what you have to oppose now<br> is the history of your own<br> selfless and perfect motherhood.<br> Are you strong enough, Isabel?<br> Can you make a fight?<br> I promise you that if<br> you take heart for it,<br> You shall have happiness,<br> and only happiness.<br> I'm saying too much<br> for wisdom, I fear.<br> But oh my dear, won't you be strong?<br> Such a little short<br> strength it would need.<br> don't strike my life<br> down twice, dear.<br> This time I've not deserved it.<br> Come in.<br> Did you read it, dear?<br> Yes, I did.<br> All of it?<br> Yes.<br> Well what do you think, Georgie?<br> What do you mean?<br> You can see how fair<br> he means to be.<br> Fair?<br> Fair when he says you and he<br> don't care what people say?<br> What people say?<br> That Eugene loves me?<br> He's always loved you.<br> That's true, Georgie.<br> But you're my mother.<br> You're an Amberson.<br> You just...<br> Yes, dear?<br> I don't know, mother.<br> I'll write Eugene.<br> He'll understand.<br> He'll wait.<br> Be better this way.<br> We'll go away for awhile, you and I.<br> Hello.<br> Lucy, you...<br> - Haven't you...?<br> - Haven't I what?<br> Nothing.<br> - May I walk with you a little ways?<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> I want to talk to you, Lucy.<br> Hope it's about something nice.<br> Papa's been so glum today,<br> he's scarcely spoken to me.<br> - Well, it's...<br> - Is it a funny story?<br> May seem like one to you.<br> Just to begin with,<br> When you went away, you didn't<br> let me know. Not a word!<br> - Not even a line!<br> - Why, no!<br> I just trotted off for some visits.<br> - At least you might have done something...<br> - Why no, George!<br> Don't you remember we'd had a quarrel.<br> And we didn't speak to<br> each other all the way home<br> from a long, long drive.<br> And since we couldn't play<br> together like good children,<br> of course it was plain that<br> we oughtn't to play at all.<br> Play!<br> What I mean is, we'd come<br> to the point where it was<br> time to quit playing.<br> Well,<br> what we were playing.<br> - That being lovers you mean, don't you?<br> - Something like that, it was absurd.<br> - Didn't have to be absurd.<br> - No, it couldn't help but be.<br> The way I am, and the way you are,<br> it would never be anything else.<br> This time, I'm going away.<br> That's what I wanted to tell you, Lucy.<br> I'm going away tomorrow night,<br> indefinitely.<br> I hope you have ever<br> so nice a time, George.<br> I don't expect to have a<br> particularly nice time.<br> Well then, if I were you,<br> I don't think I'd go.<br> This is our last<br> walk together, Lucy.<br> Evidently, if you're<br> going away tomorrow night.<br> This is the last time<br> I'll see you, ever.<br> Ever in my life.<br> Mother and I are starting on<br> a trip around the world tomorrow,<br> and we've made no plans<br> at all for coming back.<br> My, that does sound like a long trip.<br> You plan to be traveling all the<br> time, or will you stay in one<br> place for the greater part of it?<br> I think it would be lovely to...<br> Lucy! I can't stand this!<br> I'm just about ready to go in<br> that drugstore there and ask<br> the clerk to give me<br> something to keep me<br> from dying in my sights.<br> - It's quite a shock, Lucy.<br> - What is?<br> To find out just<br> how deeply you care.<br> - To see how much difference<br> this makes to you!<br> - George!<br> I can't stand this any longer!<br> I can't, Lucy.<br> Goodbye, Lucy.<br> It's goodbye.<br> - I think it's goodbye for good, Lucy.<br> - Goodbye, George.<br> I do hope that you have<br> the most splendid trip.<br> Give my love to your mother.<br> May I please have a few<br> drops of aromatic spirits of<br> ammonia and a glass of water?<br> For gosh sake, Miss!<br> It's mighty nice of you, Lucy.<br> You and Eugene to have me over to<br> your new house my first day back.<br> You'll probably find the old<br> town rather dull after Paris.<br> I...found Isabel<br> as well as usual.<br> Only I'm...afraid<br> "as usual" isn't...<br> particularly well.<br> Struck me Isabel oughta<br> be in a wheelchair.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> Oh, she's cheerful enough. At least...<br> she manages to seem so.<br> She's pretty short of breath.<br> Father's been that way<br> for years, of course, but...<br> never nearly so much<br> as Isabel is now.<br> I told her I thought she oughta<br> make Georgie let her come home.<br> "Let her"?<br> Does she want to?<br> She doesn't urge it.<br> George seems to like the life there<br> in his grand, gloomy and peculiar way.<br> She'll never change about being<br> proud of him, and all that.<br> It's quite as well...<br> she does want to come.<br> She'd like to be with father,<br> of course, and I think she's...<br> well...<br> She intimated to me one<br> day that she was afraid<br> it might even happen that...<br> she wouldn't get to see him again.<br> Think she was really thinking<br> of her own state of health.<br> I see.<br> And you say he won't<br> let her come home?<br> Well uh, I don't think he uses force...<br> He's very gentle with her.<br> Doubt if the subject is<br> mentioned between them, yet...<br> Yet knowing my interesting<br> nephew as you do,<br> wouldn't you think that was...<br> about the way to put it?<br> Knowing him as I do...<br> Yes.<br> Changed.<br> So change.<br> You mean...<br> you mean the town?<br> - You mean the old place is<br> changed, don't you dear?<br> - Yes.<br> It'll change to a happier place, old<br> dear, snow that you're back in it.<br> You're going to get well again.<br> - Mr. George will be<br> right down, Mr. Morgan<br> - Thank you.<br> I've come to see your mother, George.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.<br> Not this time, George.<br> I'm going up to see her.<br> The doctor said that...<br> she had to be kept quiet.<br> I'll be quiet.<br> I don't think you<br> should, right now.<br> The doctor says...<br> Fanny's right, Gene.<br> Why don't you come back later?<br> All right.<br> She wants to see you.<br> Darling...<br> - Did you get something to eat?<br> - Yes, mother.<br> - All you needed?<br> - Yes, mother.<br> Are you sure you didn't...<br> catch cold coming home?<br> I'm all right, mother.<br> That's sweet...<br> Sweet...<br> What is, mother darling?<br> My hand against your cheek.<br> I can feel it.<br> I wonder...<br> if Eugene and Lucy know<br> that we've come home.<br> I'm sure they do.<br> Has he asked about me?<br> Yes.<br> He was here.<br> Has he gone?<br> Yes, mother.<br> I'd like to have seen him...<br> just once.<br> She must rest now.<br> George!<br> She loved you!<br> You loved you!<br> And now,<br> Major Amberson<br> was engaged in the profoundest<br> thinking of his life.<br> And he realized that everything<br> which had worried him<br> or delighted him<br> during this lifetime,<br> all his buying and building<br> and trading and banking,<br> that it was all trifling and waste,<br> beside what concerned him now.<br> For the Major knew now that<br> he had to plan how to enter<br> an unknown country,<br> where he was not even<br> sure of being recognized<br> as an Amberson.<br> Father...<br> - Father.<br> - Ah?<br> The house was in Isabel's<br> name, wasn't it?<br> Yes.<br> Can you remember...<br> when you gave her the deed, father?<br> No.<br> No I...<br> - can't just remember.<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> Oh, this estate's about as<br> mixed-up as an estate can get.<br> You oughta have that deed, George.<br> No, don't bother.<br> It must be...in the sun...<br> there wasn't anything here...<br> but the sun in the first place.<br> The sun...<br> The earth came out of the sun,<br> and we came out of the earth.<br> So,<br> whatever we are, we<br> must be of the Earth.<br> Well...<br> Odd way for us to be saying goodbye.<br> One wouldn't have thought<br> of even a few years ago.<br> But here we are!<br> Two gentlemen of elegant appearance,<br> in a...state of bustitude.<br> Ah, you can't ever tell what'll<br> happen at all, can you?<br> Once I stood where you're standing<br> now to say goodbye to a pretty girl.<br> Only it was in the old station, before<br> this was built, we called it the "depot."<br> We knew we wouldn't see each<br> other again for almost a year...<br> I thought I couldn't live through it.<br> She stood there crying...<br> Don't even know where she lives, now.<br> Or if she is living.<br> If she ever thinks of me,<br> she probably imagines<br> I'm still dancing in the ballroom<br> of the Amberson's mansion.<br> She probably thinks of the<br> mansion as still beautiful,<br> still the finest house in town.<br> Ah, life and money both behave like...<br> loose quicksilver in a nest of cracks.<br> When they're gone, you can't tell where.<br> Or what the devil you did with them.<br> But I...<br> believe I'll say now, while<br> there isn't much time left for<br> for either of us to get<br> any more embarrassed, I...<br> I believe I'll say I've always<br> been fond of you, Georgie,<br> can't say I've always liked you.<br> But we all spoiled you<br> terribly when you were a boy,<br> but you've had a pretty heavy children,<br> you've taken it pretty quietly...<br> With the train coming into the shed,<br> you'll forgive me saying there's been<br> times I thought you oughta be hanged.<br> And just for a last word, there<br> may be somebody else in this<br> town who's always felt about you<br> like that. Fond of ya, I<br> mean. No matter how much it<br> seems you oughta be hanged!<br> - You might try...<br> - (Last train, last train.)<br> I must run!<br> I'll send back the money<br> as fast as they pay me, so goodbye<br> and God bless you, Georgie!<br> Did you ever hear the Indian name<br> for that little grove of beech trees?<br> No...<br> You never did, either.<br> Well?<br> The name was...<br> Loma Nashah.<br> It means "they couldn't help it."<br> - Doesn't sound like it.<br> - Indian names don't.<br> There was a bad Indian<br> chief lived there...<br> the worst Indian that ever lived.<br> And his name was...<br> It was...<br> Vendonah.<br> - Means "rides down everything."<br> - What?<br> Name was Vendonah, same as<br> "rides down everything."<br> I see.<br> Go on.<br> Vendonah was unspeakable.<br> He was so proud, and he<br> wore iron shoes and walked<br> over people's faces with them.<br> So at last the tribe decided<br> that it wasn't a good enough<br> excuse for him that he was<br> young and inexperienced.<br> He'd have to go.<br> So they took him down to the<br> river, and put him in a canoe,<br> and pushed him out from shore.<br> And the current carried<br> him on down to the ocean.<br> And he never got back.<br> They didn't want him back, of course.<br> They hated Vendonah,<br> But they weren't able to discover<br> any other warrior they wanted<br> to make chief in his place.<br> They couldn't help feeling that way.<br> I see.<br> So that's why they named the<br> place "they couldn't help it."<br> Must have been.<br> So, you're going to stay in your garden.<br> You think it's better just to...<br> Keep walking about among your<br> flowerbeds, till you get old.<br> Like a pensive garden lady<br> in a Victorian engraving? Hmm?<br> I suppose I'm like that<br> tribe that lived here, Papa.<br> I had too much unpleasant excitement.<br> I don't want any more.<br> In fact,<br> I don't want anything but you.<br> You don't?<br> What was the name of that grove?<br> - "They couldn't help..."<br> - Oh, the Indian name, I mean?<br> Oh..."Mola Haha."<br> Mola Haha...<br> That wasn't the name you said.<br> Oh, I've forgotten.<br> See you have.<br> Perhaps you remember<br> the chief's name better?<br> I don't.<br> I hope someday you can forget it.<br> Try and understand.<br> It's not doing either of us any<br> good going on arguing this way.<br> - That place you picked out...<br> - If this boarding house is practical...<br> - And we could be together.<br> - How?<br> On 8$ a week?<br> I'm only going to be getting<br> $8 a week at the law office.<br> You...you'd be paying more of<br> the expenses than I would.<br> I'll be paying?<br> - I be paying?<br> - Certainly, you would.<br> - We'd be using more of your money than mine.<br> - My money?<br> I've got 28 dollars. That's all!<br> - 28 dollars?<br> - That's all!<br> I know I told Jack I didn't put<br> everything in the headlight company,<br> But I did it.<br> Every cent.<br> And it's gone.<br> - Why did you wait till now to tell me?<br> - I couldn't tell till I had to.<br> It wouldn't do any good.<br> My gosh!<br> Oh, I know what you're gonna do...<br> You're...<br> you're gonna leave me in the lurch.<br> I'm only asking you to be reasonable.<br> To try and understand that<br> it's impossible for either<br> of us to go on this way.<br> - Will you get up!<br> - I can't!<br> I'm too weak!<br> Oh, none of this makes any sense!<br> Will you get up?<br> I know your mother would<br> want me to watch over ya.<br> And try and make something<br> like a home for ya.<br> And I've tried.<br> I tried to make things<br> as nice for you as I could.<br> I know that.<br> I walked my heels down<br> looking for a place for us to live.<br> I-I walked...<br> and walked over this town.<br> I didn't ride one block on a streetcar.<br> I wouldn't use five cents,<br> no matter how tired I was.<br> Oh, for gosh sakes will you get up!<br> Don't sit there with your<br> back against the boiler.<br> - Get up, aunt Fanny!<br> - It's not hot, it's cold.<br> The plumbers disconnected it.<br> I-I wouldn't mind if they hadn't!<br> I wouldn't mind if it burned!<br> I wouldn't mind if it burned me, George!<br> Oh, Fanny, for gosh sakes, get up!<br> Now stop it!<br> Stop this! Do you hear me?<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> Listen to me now!<br> There; that's better.<br> Now let's see where we stand.<br> See if we can afford this<br> place you picked out.<br> I'm-I'm sure the boarding<br> house is practical, George.<br> I'm sure it's practical!<br> I know it must be practical, aunt Fanny.<br> It is a comfort to be<br> among...among nice people.<br> It's all right - I was thinking<br> of the money, aunt Fanny.<br> There's there's there's<br> one great economy.<br> They...they don't allow tipping.<br> - They...they have files that prohibit it.<br> - That's good.<br> But the rent's $36 a month,<br> and dinner $22 and a half for each of us.<br> I've got about a hundred dollars left.<br> $100, that's all.<br> Won't need any new clothes for a year...<br> - Perhaps there...<br> - Or longer...<br> - So...so you see...<br> - Yes, I see.<br> I see that $36 and $45 make $81.<br> That's the lowest. We'll<br> need $100 a month.<br> And I'm going to be making $32.<br> A real flair!<br> Real flair for the law!<br> That's right! Couldn't wait<br> till tomorrow to begin.<br> The law's a jealous mistress,<br> and a stern mistress.<br> I can't do it. I can't<br> take up the law.<br> What?<br> I've come to tell you that<br> I've got to find something quicker.<br> Something that pays from the start.<br> I can't think of anything just this<br> minute that pays from the start.<br> Well sir, I've heard that<br> they pay very wages to people<br> in dangerous trades.<br> People that handle touchy<br> chemicals or high explosives,<br> men in the dynamite factories.<br> Thought I'd see if I couldn't<br> get a job like that.<br> I want to get started<br> tomorrow if I could.<br> Georgie, your grandfather<br> and I were boys together.<br> Don't you think I ought to<br> know what's the trouble?<br> Well sir, it's aunt Fanny.<br> She's set her mind on this<br> particular boarding house.<br> It seems she put everything<br> in the headlight company.<br> Well she's...got some old cronies,<br> and I guess she's been looking forward<br> to the games of bridge and<br> the harmless kind of gossip<br> that goes on in such places.<br> Really, it's the life she'd<br> like better than anything else.<br> Struck me that she's just<br> about got to have it.<br> I got her in that headlight<br> business with Jack. I feel a<br> certain responsibility myself.<br> I'm taking responsibility. She's<br> not your aunt you know, sir.<br> No, I'm unable to see, even<br> if she's yours, that a young<br> man is morally called upon<br> to give up a career at the<br> law to provide his aunt with<br> a favourable opportunity<br> to play to bridge with.<br> All right, all right.<br> If you promise not to get blown up,<br> I'll see if we can find you the job.<br> You certainly are the most<br> practical young man I ever met!<br> George Amberson Minafer<br> walked homeward slowly through<br> what seemed to be the strange<br> streets of a strange city.<br> For the town was growing<br> and changing.<br> It was heaving up in<br> the middle, incredibly.<br> It was spreading incredibly.<br> And as it heaved and spread,<br> it befouled itself, and darkened it's sky.<br> This was the last walk home<br> he was ever to take up National<br> Avenue to Amberson Addition,<br> and the big old house at the<br> foot of Amberson Boulevard.<br> Tomorrow, they were to move out.<br> Tomorrow, everything would be gone.<br> Ma, forgive me.<br> God forgive me.<br> Something had happened.<br> A thing which, years ago,<br> had been the eagerest<br> hope of many, many<br> good citizens of the town.<br> Now it came at last.<br> George Amberson Minafer<br> had got his come-uppance.<br> He got it three times filled,<br> and running over.<br> But those who has so longed for<br> it were not there to see it.<br> And they never knew it.<br> Those who were still living<br> had forgotten all about it.<br> And all about him.<br> All right, stay back there, now.<br> He run into me as much<br> as I run into him.<br> And if he gets well, he ain't gonna<br> get not one single cent out of me!<br> I'm perfectly willing to<br> say I'm sorry for him, and<br> so's the lady with me.<br> Wonderful the damage one of<br> these little machines can<br> do you'd never believe it.<br> All right sonny, back in<br> your car, back in your car.<br> All right, stay back there now!<br> GOVERNOR FLAYS AUTO DEATHS<br> PROMISES SWIFT ACTION<br> SERIOUS ACCIDEN<br> G.A.
