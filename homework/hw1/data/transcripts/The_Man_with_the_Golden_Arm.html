And they chipped<br> in and bought me these when I left.<br> Wow!<br> Long time dealer.<br> How was it there, bad, huh?<br> It was alright.<br> Six months, you can hardly wait I bet.<br> Come over my place. C'mon.<br> No thanks, Louie.<br> You broke. Now ain't yer<br> being stupid, it's for free.<br> I don't need it, is all. I kicked it.<br> Oh. Kicked it. One of them.<br> - I mean it.<br> - Sure.<br> I'll be around.<br> Frankie don't do it. Don't start up<br> with that peddler again.<br> Me, I'd rather chop my arm off<br> before I let him touch it.<br> This Dr. Lennox who took care of me<br> down at the hospital. A real good guy.<br> He told me at least ten times.<br> He said,<br> "Frankie when you get out of here,<br> you take even one fix,<br> you're hooked again. "<br> Don't worry about me, buddy boy.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> Thanks Antek.<br> Antek, take care of this asset for me.<br> I got a customer coming to get it.<br> Ok. Sparrow.<br> Don't let him give you no gas.<br> Him?

When?<br> Right away today. I'm the kinda' guy,<br> boy when I move, watch my smoke.<br> But I'm gonna' need<br> some good clothes, though.<br> Oh, well you go on up.<br> I'm gonna' find you some.<br> - Yeah, yeah. Size 39 get.<br> - 39.<br> - Stripes.<br> - Stripes.<br> Somethin' nice.<br> (Loud crashing noises,<br> coming from an apartment)<br> (Landlord). You stop that noise!<br> You and husband,<br> or I throw you both out.<br> You hear!<br> (Vi)<br> I'll make all the noise I want.<br> (Landlord) Who is landlord?<br> Me! You do like I say.<br> You're mother's icebox,<br> I'll do like you say.<br> Frankie Machine! Ah, you look great.<br> How are you feelin', Frankie? I mean...<br> Fine, Vi, just fine. Hiya landlord.<br> Mad. She and husband fight<br> all the time. Holler, throw things.<br> Nothing changes.<br> (Landlord) This is respectable<br> house and I am respectable man.<br> (Vi) Respectable, my eye.<br> Go on get out you're late<br> for the paroleboard.<br> Frankie!<br> Oh, Frankie.<br> Zosh.<br> Oh, Frankie I love you so much...<br> I've missed you so... I've missed you...<br> I've been so lonely Frankie without you.<br> SSh.<br> So lonely without you.<br> Zosh stop crying.<br> Zosh let me look at you.<br> My eyes are gonna' be all red.<br> No, you look fine, Zosh.<br> Honest? Has the cold sore gone?<br> No, you look real good.<br> I had this cold sore. I want to look real<br> nice for you when you came back<br> and I was afraid it would'nt be gone,<br> so I put this goofy salve on to dry it.<br> Oh Francis.<br> No, Zosh,<br> everything's gonna' be alright.<br> Oh, you didn't see it. Look Vi got the<br> cake by the bakery, but the sign I made.<br> It's sorta' like for a welcome home.<br> Gee it's like a real party or somethin'.<br> It's real nice Zosh.<br> How are you Frankie?<br> I'm clean.<br> Sure?<br> I kicked it for keeps.<br> Did it hurt? How was it there for you?<br> Oh, they treated me fine down there.<br> There was this Dr. This Dr. Lennox.<br> He was real good to me.<br> Frankie, Frankie did you miss me?<br> Of course I missed you Zosh.<br> What kind of silly question is that?<br> Of course I missed you,<br> honest no kiddin'.<br> What have you got there?<br> You'll see.<br> Oh, I brought you somethin'.<br> There.<br> Oh, it's an exquisite thing.<br> You like it? I made it myself,<br> out of cigarette wrappers.<br> It's just an exquisite thing, is all.<br> You made it?<br> Yeah, for a hobby like. See part<br> of the cure is to keep yourself busy<br> doing things you enjoy. Like for instance<br> I wanted to learn to drum and music.<br> Doctor Lennox got them<br> to help me do it.<br> During the day I was kept busy enough,<br> but sometimes at night,<br> I get restless I wanted to keep my<br> mind of the craving. I made that.<br> There's somethin' important<br> I gotta' tell you.<br> What?<br> I forget right now.<br> (Zosh whistles )<br> A whistle?<br> Oh, I was scared sometimes<br> being alone. So Vi got it for me,<br> I should blow for her when I wanted her.<br> Go on you were telling me.<br> Oh, well the first thing you do<br> when you get there,<br> you talk to a doctor for about two hours.<br> Oh, know. I know what it is.<br> I know what I had to tell you.<br> Vi took me to this movie and the<br> girl's kid brother had a friend in it.<br> Now who do you think he looked like?<br> Who?<br> You! Oh, it was a good movie.<br> The stage show was real good too.<br> We owe Vi eighty cents<br> for the movie, I was broke.<br> We owe her for the cake too.<br> How come you don't have any money?<br> Schwiefka didn't kick in regular?<br> No.<br> Well he was supposed to.<br> It was his joint they raided not mine.<br> I was just the dealer. I kept<br> my mouth shut and took the rap.<br> If he didn't send fifty a month<br> regular, how much did he?<br> Well he sent fifty but not regular. You<br> see Vi had to kick in for me sometimes.<br> She took good care of you?<br> Had fun with her?<br> Yeah, but not like when you're here.<br> It was terrible being alone Frankie.<br> And my legs when they hurt, she don't<br> massage like you when they hurt.<br> What do they say by the clinic, Zosh?<br> I stopped going by that goofy clinic.<br> The clinic must know what's right, Zosh.<br> You gotta' start the clinic again.<br> You gotta' get well.<br> Vi dreamed that this new doctor<br> round the corner he cured me.<br> I'd have gone to him already<br> but he ain't free like the clinic.<br> Now your back making money<br> again by Schwiefka, I'll go.<br> I've finished with Schwiefka,<br> I don't deal for him no more.<br> But you always deal. You're a dealer;<br> you're the best dealer in the business.<br> No more. I'm a drummer now.<br> Don't make jokes Frankie. I never<br> know when you're making jokes.<br> Who's joking, Zosh. Listen...<br> Nice, huh?<br> This Doctor Lennox,<br> I told him my whole life story.<br> From when I was born almost.<br> About you and me. But he told me<br> that if I lived when I got out like I lived<br> before I went in there, the chances are<br> I'd be hooked in no time. So<br> that's why I want to get with a band.<br> Listen...<br> How's that?<br> Cute. What did you tell<br> him about me, this doctor?<br> I told him about getting some money,<br> getting you well. And he said<br> getting with a band<br> was a good way to go at it.<br> He even gave me the name of a<br> guy in town, right here, to get a job.<br> That's nice. I mean if this man with<br> a job ever heard of this great doctor.<br> Most times these things<br> just don't come through.<br> I got this.<br> What is it?<br> It's a letter from the doc.<br> I think I'll go call him now.<br> Now. Let's talk about it tomorrow.<br> I'll be right up, Zosh.<br> You ain't even tasted the cake.<br> I'll only be a minute. I'll be right up.<br> No! Now! Frankie.<br> First taste a piece of nice...<br> (door slams shut)<br> cake.<br> Hey, are you coming baby?<br> (Molly )<br> Yeah, yeah I'm coming Johnny.<br> Hey Molly.<br> (Molly ) Yeah I'm coming, Johnny.<br> I want to talk to Mr Harry Lane please?<br> How about it, huh?<br> Machine, Frankie Machine.<br> Yeah, I got a letter of introduction<br> for him from Doctor Lennox.<br> Yeah.<br> Hello Frankie.<br> Doctor Martin Lennox.<br> How have you been, Molly?<br> Alright.<br> (Jack) C'mon baby, let's go.<br> Yeah, I'm coming Johnny.<br> I guy I met while you was away.<br> Mr Lane, I got a letter for you, yeah.<br> C'mon on, what do you say, kid?<br> This afternoon, huh? Well gee,<br> I sure do appreciate it Mr Lane,<br> thank you so much.<br> Ok, goodbye.<br> Frankie, a new thing by<br> Bracks department store.<br> No sales girls you just help yourself.<br> It's what they call our honour system.<br> What's the matter, Frankie?<br> Feel that material. And I figured<br> as long as I'm there. Nice, huh?<br> Are you alright? Frankie?<br> I got the drumming job.<br> Already. Wow!<br> When I move I move<br> like a streak, punk.<br> Think it looks alright, Zosh?<br> How come you ask me all of a sudden?<br> I just want to know<br> if it looks alright, Zosh.<br> And my name ain't Zosh it's Sophia.<br> What's the matter?<br> Nothing's the matter. Except how would<br> you feel if your spine was hurting?<br> Why didn't you say so?<br> On account it's your first day back,<br> I just didn't want you should worry.<br> Don't be like that Zosh. Is it bad?<br> Maybe the new doctor<br> will do me some good, huh?<br> We'll go see him when I get back.<br> Take me now, Frankie.<br> Zosh, I got this appointment,<br> you know how much it means to me.<br> We'll go as soon as I get back.<br> Please, Frankie.<br> I'll hurry, I'll hurry.<br> Frankie, give me a little<br> more massage then, first, huh?<br> Zosh, I'm doing this for you to get some<br> money so you can get a good doctor.<br> Oh, please, Frankie.<br> Look I'll get you a dog too, how's<br> that, huh? Get her a dog, will you.<br> I'll give the matter<br> my personal attention.<br> Just have confidence<br> in the management.<br> Wish me luck Zosh.<br> Frankie.<br> Oh, Frankie.<br> Wait, wait Frankie.<br> Can't be two places at once.<br> What could I do?<br> - Yes, she just don't realise.<br> - Shut-up punk, she just don't realise.<br> How would you like<br> to be nailed to a chair?<br> (Loud noise of tapping on window).<br> Frankie, Frankie how are ya? Antek!<br> Well it didn't do you no harm did it,<br> Frankie? Oh you look good.<br> That's right Schwiefka,<br> it was a real country club.<br> Mmm. They give you this<br> when they let you out?<br> Give him nothin'; I bought it by Bracks.<br> You know I come as soon as hear<br> you're out. I figured he's worried about<br> getting his job again. Tell him don't<br> worry, Schwiefka don't forget so quick.<br> Job's waitin'.<br> You need a dealer you say?<br> Need. No. I've been<br> dealing myself and man<br> I've built up a game<br> like nobody's business.<br> I got a great following.<br> They're playing bigger than ever.<br> I hear you wasn't doin' so good.<br> From who? When I say great,<br> I don't mean a lot. A few but loaded.<br> So what do you want me for?<br> Like I'm tellin' ya,<br> I take care of my friends.<br> Can I polish your halo, Schwiefka?<br> Only a quarter.<br> Knock it off punk.<br> Look I've been doin' alright.<br> But I don't say that the customers<br> like me better than like you.<br> The dealer makes the house,<br> I know that.<br> Wha d'ya say?<br> No.<br> You're dealing for some other joint.<br> I ain't dealing for nobody.<br> I ain't dealing for nobody no more.<br> Is that the way you repay me? Didn't I<br> send money to Zosh? Here I've gone<br> and told all my friends,<br> that you'll be working for me again.<br> What am I supposed to do?<br> As far as I'm concerned you<br> can go back to matching pennies<br> with school kids.<br> Hey Antek. Antek!<br> Who is he?<br> Drunky. His name's Johnny somethin'.<br> He's houseman for<br> Gubercek's poolroom.<br> Is that a thing with them?<br> They see each other.<br> You wanna' meet him?<br> No. So long Antek.<br> See ya Frankie.<br> Hey you.<br> Get in dealer.<br> Who me?

Hey here's a satisfied customer.<br> Frankie that dog I got you,<br> makes a big difference<br> in your life, don't it?<br> Yeah Big.<br> (TV sport announcer)<br> The first baseman London to bat.<br> I wanna' see you.<br> After the inning.<br> I'll still bet you six to five.<br> (TV announcer)<br> It's a strike, strike one.<br> London getting settled in.<br> London swings and it's a high ball.<br> Roberts trying to get it.<br> It may go into the stand.<br> He's gonna' try, it's gonna' be close.<br> Roberts makes a tremendous leap<br> and he's got it.<br> How are you Frankie? You make out<br> alright with the fella' with the job?<br> Oh, the drumming job? Fine, fine. Well<br> not so fine. He set a top down on me.<br> He promised to call me, but.<br> It's too bad.<br> A million drummers<br> in the world, how do I rate?<br> Maybe he lost your number.<br> Ha.<br> It happens.<br> Maybe he's just wishing<br> you'd get in touch.<br> He'd think I was a pest.<br> Why should he? A good drummer that's<br> somethin' that don't turn up very day.<br> Go on Frankie, call him.<br> Go on Frankie.<br> (TV announcer) Well it promises<br> to be quite a ball game, if these first two<br> innings are any indication. Home team<br> was leading by one run. The only score<br> in the game, thanks to that mighty<br> swat by Milton in the second innings.<br> Come on Molly, watch the game.<br> I don't feel like it Johnny, why don't<br> you go ahead? I'll wait for you.<br> (TV announcer) This is the<br> last game here before the team leaves<br> on a tour trip.<br> Yes, studio B Monday morning.<br> Fine, thank you Mr Lane, bye.<br> Monday I got an audition Monday, me.<br> He told me to join the union<br> and be ready to work.<br> Oh, that's swell Frankie.<br> You know he did lose my number.<br> He's been tryin' to find me<br> all week long. Here I was<br> ready to forget the whole thing.<br> Gee, if you hadn't opened your<br> mouth I wouldn't have called him.<br> I'm sure you would.<br> I've got an audition<br> with a big band. Me on TV.<br> Practice a lot Frankie.<br> Practice, I'll beat those heads to a<br> shred. Only I gotta' find a place, where.<br> Zosh can't stand the noise.<br> Molly? You suppose maybe<br> I could put the drums in your place?<br> And sorta' drop in once in a while?<br> Why not? Molly, why not?<br> Oh, Johnny wouldn't understand.<br> So what could he do?<br> It ain't a question<br> what he could do, Frankie.<br> A fella' like Johnny<br> can't do much about anything.<br> It's a question of what it does to him.<br> I'm all he has in the world.<br> I don't want to hurt him.<br> Molly, for crying out loud.<br> Oh, you don't know,<br> Frankie, a fella' like him.<br> Sometimes when we're alone...<br> What does he do, cry?<br> He's a lush, Molly.<br> He's a hundred per cent habitual drunk.<br> Look, everybody's an habitual<br> somethin'. With him it's liquor is all.<br> Please, Molly. Molly-O.<br> It ain't just that Frankie.<br> I don't want it to start<br> with each other again.<br> Look what you said about us<br> not being good, it was the truth.<br> Even before you went away,<br> I tried to...<br> It just doesn't add up.<br> Never did, it never can.<br> Give it a chance.<br> I told you it would one day.<br> All my life has been one day.<br> On and on, and on.<br> I got drums I'm headed for a good job.<br> Is that so on and on and on.<br> I make some money, make Zosh well.<br> What's so on and on about that?<br> Don't shut me out Molly, I'm tryin'.<br> Did you want to see me?<br> No.<br> What do you mean, no?<br> Vi. Here, what we owe.<br> Frankie, Vi says can she trust me.<br> Tell her Frankie what<br> an honest hustler I am.<br> Frankie, I guess maybe<br> you could drop in once in a while.<br> Thanks, Molly-O.<br> (Sound of Traffic noises )<br> (Sound of Rumba band<br> playing on the radio)<br> How's that?<br> Real nice.<br> You should have heard what<br> I did with Perdido a little while ago.<br> Good, huh? I hope<br> the neighbours liked it too.<br> I'm very big with the neighbours.<br> They keep banging on the pipes to let<br> me know how much they appreciate it.<br> I won't let it go<br> to my head though.<br> Well keep playing drums at five am;<br> you'll see what goes to your head.<br> You slip me a smile,<br> I might give you my autograph.<br> You won't have to fight your way<br> through the bobby-soxers to get to me.<br> I bet those bobby-soxers<br> go for you, at that.<br> Ah.<br> You tired?<br> But in a very nice way.<br> I've been feelin' good all night.<br> I joined the Musicians Union today.<br> Schwiefka loan you the money?<br> Him.<br> Who did?<br> Nobody. I'm gonna' hock the drums.<br> Oh, Frankie. No.<br> I got it figured out pretty good.<br> When I get a job I'll take an<br> advance, I'll get the drums out again.<br> Meantime I'll use a practice pad.<br> You should have asked Schwiefka.<br> Haven't even seen him.<br> You didn't go the work?<br> I've been practicing here all night.<br> I quit the game Molly.<br> It wouldn't have hurt you<br> to wait a coupla' days Frank.<br> I wanted to quit.<br> I'm quitting a couple of things.<br> Is it bad?<br> Not too bad.<br> You shouldn't have started again.<br> Who knows why<br> I started in the first place?<br> I guess in the beginning<br> it grew on me for kicks.<br> Louie gave me my first shot for nothin'.<br> I thought I could take it or leave it alone.<br> So I took it and I took again and again.<br> One day Louie wasn't around.<br> I nearly went crazy till I found him.<br> Oh, I was sick.<br> I was so sick.<br> You can't be that sick and live.<br> That's why I knew I was hooked.<br> There was a forty-pound<br> monkey on my back.<br> The only way to get along with a load<br> like that is to keep leaning on a fix.<br> (Molly starts sobbing)<br> Don't.<br> Don't.<br> I'm one of the lucky ones Molly.<br> I kicked it and I'm not too far hooked<br> to kick it again. I've had my last fix.<br> I mean it, Molly.<br> Tell me somethin. '<br> You think those bobby-soxers<br> will really go for me?<br> You can be such a ham.<br> Yeah maybe I'll get Sparrow<br> a job with the orchestra.<br> Or when I can put enough<br> money together I can get Zosh<br> into a real good hospital,<br> so she can walk and dance again.<br> And then maybe.<br> (Loud knocking on door)<br> Who is it?<br> Schwiefka, open up.<br> Just a minute.<br> Alright, alright where is he?<br> Good morning Mrs. Machine.<br> Frankie?<br> - Frankie where is he?<br> - What is it? What did he do?<br> What did he do? You know what he did.<br> He quit. No notice, no nothin'.<br> He sends word by that misfit that he's<br> through. I had to take the slot myself.<br> Where is he?<br> Oh, he wasn't at the game?<br> Would we be looking for him all over, if<br> he was at the game? He eats my bread,<br> six years he eats my bread. He gets<br> put away I sent you money regular.<br> He gets out, I give him his job back.<br> - Shut-up.<br> - What do you mean, shut-up?<br> Shut-up. Do you think it was easy<br> talkin' fellas' like Williams and Markette<br> up to a two-bit game like yours, huh?<br> Louie, Louie I.<br> - I sold them on Frankie.<br> - Why are we getting' excited?<br> They're fat in the pocket<br> and hungry for action.<br> We finally get a chance to score big,<br> and you lose the dealer.<br> Look Louie, I swear, I swear<br> when Markette and Williams come<br> the dealer will be there.<br> Or a player just as good.<br> There ain't none as good.<br> Why didn't you offer him more money?<br> - A piece of the play.<br> - From your end or mine?<br> What's the difference who's end?<br> Do you expect me to stand here<br> and argue about pennies?<br> Your end.<br> Look, I'm a musician.<br> Well how does it feel?<br> Well, it feels like. You'd better hang on<br> to my arm or I'll go up like a balloon.<br> I'm a musician. Hmm Hmm.<br> Where are we going?<br> I don't know, but<br> I want to buy you somethin'<br> Oh, no.<br> I gotta' spend some money or I'll bust.<br> How about one of those in green?<br> Frankie.<br> Maybe a colour TV set.<br> Go on.<br> Would you look at this production?<br> And only for cookin'.<br> Now who would want a thing like that?<br> Boy, it's goofy, huh?<br> It's pretty, huh?<br> I wonder what he does for a living?<br> Him?<br> Well, must make a nice dollar.<br> Look the way he dresses her.<br> - A kitchen like that.<br> - I notice he don't help her none though.<br> I bet he didn't even marry the girl.<br> Look at that she ain't even<br> wearing a ring on her finger.<br> She takes it off<br> when she cooks, maybe.<br> And he's tired after a hard day's work.<br> Alright, so let him sit there, but at least<br> he could talk to her once in a while.<br> He doesn't have to sit there with<br> his nose buried in a magazine.<br> I would talk to her.<br> What would you say?<br> Oh, I'd say how you been?<br> How did it go today? What's for supper?<br> Steak. Steak's for supper<br> and everything went fine today.<br> Steak? Good. Now how about<br> you and me stepping out tonight,<br> after we eat?<br> Why don't we just stay home?<br> Turn on some music?<br> Yeah. I like that better. We'll just<br> stay home and turn on some music.<br> I wish it was Monday, already.<br> Hi Zosh.<br> Oh, where you been? Schwiefka<br> was here and said you quit him.<br> - Where you been?<br> - Look.<br> - Why did you quit him?<br> - I got a try out on Monday.<br> And if the bandleader<br> likes the way I play, I'm hired.<br> Frankie. Go tell Schwiefka<br> you was foolin', you'll deal.<br> Maybe this bandleader<br> won't like how you play.<br> Zosh, look I joined the Musicians Union.<br> Why you gotta' go around changin'<br> things? Why can't it be like always?<br> Why you gotta' quit dealing, Frankie?<br> How are we gonna' live<br> with no money coming in?<br> - It'll start coming in, Monday.<br> - Suppose they call this big try out off?<br> You can't tell me it's<br> a sure thing, can you?<br> Oh Frankie, deal for Schwiefka<br> like always. Forget this great job.<br> I quit dealing, Zosh.

You think I<br> don't know what you really want.<br> You think I don't know what you and<br> him have been up to behind my back,<br> while I've had to sit here<br> all these years?<br> Had to sit here all these years.<br> No Zosh, you got it wrong.<br> No you got it wrong.<br> 'Cos you'll never get him.<br> He put me in this chair and as long<br> as I sit here he'll never leave me.<br> He knows he belongs to me.<br> - No Zosh, I come here only to help.<br> - I wouldn't want to live if he left me.<br> And I'd rather see him dead<br> too than have him go to you.<br> Zosh, please.<br> Get outa' here!
