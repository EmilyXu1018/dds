Exchange dropped more than a heart-stopping<br> thousand points in early trading.<br> Its biggest drop ever.<br> The Prime Minister is now<br> facing a motion of censure<br> in the parliament from the opposition,<br> which claims soldiers used excessive force.<br> Many Christians believe it's the wake-up call.<br> Hundreds gather to pray for<br> America and the faith.<br> Huge vicious battles were<br> breaking out, across the city.<br> Around the world, stock markets continue<br> their terrifying plunge.<br> More violence remains a distinct possibility.<br> The economic woes, of America<br> and the economic woes of many<br> other economies in the world,<br> the great push is going to be<br> toward a global, one-world...<br> Thanks to a microchip under your skin.<br> It's all there.<br> Science fiction 20 years ago,<br> but a biometric reality, today.<br> The Avanti Corporation<br> announced today, it has begun<br> testing its first human implant.<br> Just announced, this week, that<br> he wants to see a new financial<br> condition in the world... and he also says,<br> "I want to see a one-world government<br> led by a one-world leader."<br> It wasn't what you thought it was gonna be.<br> OK, so you're dying.<br> I mean, at least you're done with it, you know?<br> Yeah, but that's not what it's about, though.<br> Well, what is?<br> I mean, you served your country,<br> and honorably, I might add.<br> I took a bullet and I got a little...<br> purple heart.<br> For God and country?<br> Well, I'll tell you one thing, I didn't<br> see a whole lot of God over there.<br> And don't talk to me about the<br> Lord works in mysterious ways.<br> I don't wanna hear that.<br> You know everybody has their<br> own purpose in life, Chad,<br> and everything happens for a reason.<br> It's all part of the big picture, man.<br> What big picture?<br> When He reveals it, then we'll know.<br> Little brother, you got your<br> God and you got your religion<br> and I respect that, I really do,<br> but that's not the real world.<br> Welcome back.<br> Name's Cooper.<br> I work for Avanti,<br> the company that hired your<br> team to run security for us.<br> What happened? I'm still a little bit foggy.<br> What happened is you just<br> became a very valuable man.<br> So, what am I, Superman now?<br> Sort of.<br> It wasn't supposed to happen<br> this way, Mr. Turner,<br> but it did.<br> Because of that, you're able to earn in one job<br> what might take your entire career.<br> OK, I'm listening.<br> The G20 Summit happens in Berlin next week.<br> I need that chip to arrive there safely.<br> So you need to get me there safely.<br> You and that chip are connected, forever linked.<br> So what's the plan?<br> Commercial flight in 2 days.<br> We hide in plain sight.<br> This is the most authoritative accounting to date<br> of Lehman's collapse, and pretty much of any firm<br> that experienced the trauma...<br> This way Mr. Pike.<br> What were the biggest surprises to you?<br> I am the way...<br> And the truth and the life.<br> Do you know how many languages are spoken today?<br> No, but I'm sure you're about to enlighten me.<br> There used to be one: grunting and hand signals.<br> Primitive, but it worked.<br> Now there's over a hundred,<br> hundred different ways to say the same thing.<br> Does it make any sense to you?<br> Change is the nature of life.<br> Mankind will always do what it needs<br> to ensure its own survival.<br> But that's just it.<br> It's not working.<br> It's falling apart.<br> Too many nations, too many<br> currencies, too much fighting<br> and too much sickness.<br> Masses are beginning to rally against hunger,<br> unemployment, and poverty.<br> Everything is out of balance.<br> Something has to change.<br> The world is in chaos, or<br> religiously they'll see it as<br> the end of the world and other<br> gibberish, like the Rapture.<br> Obviously, the world is in<br> desperate need of a savior<br> and I have the answer.<br> I intend to be that savior.<br> I have no interest in your<br> politics, or your opinion.<br> The only thing that concerns me<br> is that I successfully complete<br> the job you pay me to do.<br> So what is it you need from me?<br> A new technology has emerged,<br> a microchip designed<br> by the Avanti Corporation.<br> I offered to buy it.<br> They refused.<br> It's being transported, by<br> plane, from Bangkok, to Berlin.<br> I want you to bring it to me.<br> You know my price.<br> I want 50% up front.<br> And I'm gonna need 500,000<br> euros for operating costs.<br> All taken care of.<br> Here's your mark.<br> I'll be in touch.<br> Sir?

Day-O.<br> It's Dao.<br> Oh.<br> That way.<br> I'm Jodi, by the way.<br> Chad.<br> So you guys are with Avanti, aren't you?<br> You and your buddy over there<br> that keeps looking over,<br> the one you're not with?<br> It's my job to know when<br> people are hiding something.<br> I'm guessing you're what, security?<br> What are you, a detective?<br> Journalist.<br> Ha, I should have known.<br> There.<br> We're in.<br> Good.<br> You got 5 minutes.<br> So you want to know how I know<br> you're with Avanti, Chad?<br> I'm just dying, Jodi.<br> Your buddy's watch.<br> Last year Avanti's top 20 executives were awarded<br> an $80,000 Patek Philippe watch,<br> and your buddy over there,<br> he's wearing one.<br> Hmm, all that really proves is<br> that you need to get yourself<br> a hobby or maybe... maybe a boyfriend?<br> Both true facts, but far from the point.<br> The point is I know that the G20 Summit<br> is next week in Berlin, and I know that Avanti<br> is supposed to make some kind<br> of big announcement there.<br> So I'm willing to bet that<br> that is where you are going.<br> Radios.<br> Hurry, up, Jiri.<br> So Cap, where did you get engaged?<br> It was after a single's volleyball game<br> and we were in the back of a Volkswagen Bug.<br> - No way.<br> - Yeah.<br> That's not very romantic.<br> No, I'm not very good at that.<br> You know Jen's a Christian.<br> Yeah, of course.<br> How are you gonna handle that?<br> Yeah, I know.<br> I guess we just, you know, we<br> don't really talk about it.<br> You should talk about it.<br> You think so?<br> I do.<br> Hmm.<br> I'm gonna get a coffee.<br> Give her a kiss for me.<br> - I will.<br> - And get me a ginger ale.<br> OK.<br> Don't you see what's happening?<br> This Summit is just a smokescreen<br> for what's really going on.<br> Alright Jodi, why don't you<br> tell me what's really going on.<br> Our financial system is collapsing<br> into a global power-grab by the wealthy bankers,<br> the politicians, and big business.<br> Think European Union, only much bigger.<br> The entire world under a single currency,<br> a single bank, and eventually, a single leader.<br> Are we talking about Satan?<br> Here, go back up.<br> So you have read the Bible.<br> Yeah.<br> Then you know how this lays out.<br> You gotta admit, this looks a lot<br> like the beginning of the<br> end; it looks a lot like<br> the Tribulation.<br> Look, to me, it's just another book.<br> How can you say that?<br> Because I live in reality.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hurry up! Hurry up!<br> Oh, hi, Ted.<br> Are you lost?

"<br> Little brother, I seen the horrors of war.<br> I watched a 12-year-old girl take a bullet,<br> died right there on my arms, OK?<br> Why would God let an innocent<br> child die like that?<br> The death of a child is... it's<br> always a tragic event, man,<br> it always is.<br> But let me guess, you got<br> an answer for me, right?<br> 'Cause you always have an answer for everything.<br> No, not everything.<br> This one, I think I do.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Enlighten me.<br> You know, I believe the child's purpose<br> was to ensure that you survived.<br> She took that bullet that was meant for you<br> in order for you to live<br> out your purpose in life.<br> Oh, I didn't see you there.<br> Can I, help you with something?<br> Ah, ginger ale.<br> - Looking for something, Ted?<br> - Oh, hey, Dao.<br> Uh, yeah, ginger ale for the Cap.<br> Oh, it's back there.<br> Hang on.<br> Jennifer?

Now!<br> Let's go!<br> Captain won't open the door.<br> - Oh, is that right?<br> - Yeah, that's right.<br> And I know him.<br> But you don't know me, do you?<br> Jiri?<br> You still there?<br> I'm here. What happened?<br> Yeah, there's been a little setback up here.<br> I need some explosive up here ASAP.<br> Hang on, let's see if we can<br> do this the easy way first.<br> Quit your whining, you ain't gonna die.<br> Move! Move!<br> Don't move!<br> Ted Scott.<br> It is Ted, right?<br> You do realize that with or<br> without your assistance,<br> I am gonna get into this cockpit.<br> From Jiri.<br> Captain, have I got your attention?<br> You see this?<br> This is a high-powered gelatin explosive,<br> strong enough to blow this<br> door off of its hinges.<br> Now, that's the good news.<br> The bad news is it might take out<br> most of us at the same time.<br> So I suggest you open this door<br> if you wanna stop anybody else from getting hurt.<br> Now unless you cooperate,<br> people out here are gonna start dying.<br> Anybody inside?<br> Has anyone found the mark?<br> No, sir.<br> We're still looking, but there's no sign of him.<br> That's impossible.<br> Graham, go get one of the flight attendants, now.<br> Is there anywhere else on this<br> plane somebody could be hiding?<br> I said, is there anywhere else on this plane<br> someone could hide?<br> No, no, there's nowhere else.<br> - What is it?<br> - Our package has gone missing.<br> He may have joined you down there.<br> Captain?<br> This is the captain. Who is this?<br> This is the man that's taken over your plane.<br> Listen, I'm the captain and I'm<br> still in control of this plane.<br> For now.<br> You follow a few simple of instructions,<br> it'll stay that way.<br> I don't want anyone getting hurt.<br> No one's getting hurt.<br> I just need you to change altitude.<br> I'm not flying this plane into any building.<br> I'm a businessman, Captain. Not a suicide bomber.<br> Look, this is the easiest<br> choice you're ever gonna<br> have to make in your life.<br> You do it and I won't be<br> forced to kill anybody else.<br> Anyone else?<br> Oh, I'll kill you!<br> It was unavoidable.<br> Oh, no!<br> Look, Captain, you're gonna do as I say.<br> He wants to talk to you.<br> Captain, I'm sorry.<br> I found the package.<br> You want me to send it up?<br> Just make sure he's secure.<br> Well, I got what I came for, now it's up to you.<br> The only thing left to do<br> is to shake it up a bit.<br> What?<br> And you know what I mean, shake it up.<br> Now!<br> Jennifer!<br> And I want the lights on.<br> Captain, can you please level out the plane?<br> Did it work?<br> Did it work?<br> Yeah, it worked, Captain, but now I'm mad.<br> Get down! Get down in your seats!<br> Hook this up so I can talk to the passengers.<br> Hook this thing up so I can<br> talk to the passengers!<br> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm<br> sorry about the turbulence.<br> I can assure you it won't happen<br> again, 'cause if it does,<br> I will kill each and every<br> one without hesitation.<br> Do I make myself clear?<br> Graham, get these two out of here.<br> Jenson, get to work on those explosives.<br> I want this door open now.<br> Jiri, are you there?<br> What's going on?<br> Jiri, talk to me.<br> What's going on?<br> Something's wrong.<br> Get down to the cargo hold, yeah?<br> Find out what's going on.<br> Jiri?<br> Jiri?<br> Jiri is nowhere to be found.<br> I'm sure he's dead.<br> You, down there, in the cargo hold.<br> You take one of mine, I'll take one of yours.<br> No! No, no, no, no, no!<br> Shoot me.<br> How pathetically noble.<br> All in good time, Mr. Scott.<br> No, no!<br> No! No! No! No! No!<br> Get her out of here.<br> I'm sending you down company, Chad.<br> Your friend from the bar.<br> Talk to him.<br> I said talk to him.<br> Chad, this is Dao.<br> Can you hear me? Chad?<br> You got something I want.<br> If you don't bring it up here in 5 seconds,<br> I'm gonna put a bullet in this pretty little<br> flight attendant's head.<br> Five...<br> four...<br> three...<br> two...<br> Hold it!<br> So you're the one giving me all these headaches.<br> I believe you have a knife.<br> I'll take that.<br> Give me the knife.<br> Hey, Jeremy.<br> We got company, Blue Team, east side!<br> So what am I, Superman, now?<br> She took a bullet that was meant for you<br> so that you can live out your purpose.<br> The entire world under a single<br> currency, a single leader.<br> I know you don't understand<br> that, but one day you will.<br> When the time comes,<br> God will reveal His plan for you.<br> You and that chip are connected, forever linked.<br> All you have to do is just accept His love<br> with an open heart.<br> He will...<br> reveal His plan to you.<br> Mr. Turner?<br> Mr. Turner?<br> I can't find what I came here for.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, well, how's that my problem?<br> Because I have it on good authority that you have,<br> in your possession, that, which I am looking for.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> Sure you do.<br> And if I don't get what I came for, I'm gonna<br> start shooting these passengers,<br> starting with her.<br> She's not a passenger.<br> She is now.<br> Alright, wait.<br> Just...<br> You're not gonna find what you're looking for.<br> Why? It's in your checked luggage?<br> It's not in my luggage.<br> It's not on me.<br> It's in me.<br> Come again?<br> It's an implant.<br> It's functioning?<br> Yeah.<br> Well, that's even better.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - What am I gonna do?<br> I'm gonna cut it out.<br> Too bad you killed the only one of us<br> with any kind of medical training.<br> I wouldn't do that if I were you.<br> And just who might you be?<br> I work for-I work for the<br> company that hired Mr. Turner.<br> He's the first completely<br> successful human implant.<br> It won't do you any good to cut him up.<br> Then I'll just cut off the whole hand.<br> That certainly won't work.<br> What will?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What do you mean nothing?<br> The chip is biometric.<br> It's fueled by his own blood supply.<br> If you try to remove it in<br> any way, it will release<br> a deadly neurotoxin, killing him instantly.<br> Bollocks. You expect me to believe that?<br> I don't expect anything, but if you do kill him,<br> the chip will shut down,<br> effectively killing itself.<br> Whoever hired you didn't tell you much, huh?<br> It's back to plan B.<br> You, watch him.<br> You, get him out of here.<br> Captain, are you there?<br> You said you weren't gonna kill anyone else.<br> That was a separate matter.<br> You should be more concerned<br> about the other passengers,<br> right now.<br> I've got what I came for.<br> You play your cards right,<br> I'll be out of here shortly.<br> What is it you need me to do?<br> I need you to descend to 5,000 feet.<br> Alright, but I can't guarantee<br> what the turbulence<br> will be at that altitude.<br> Well, then you better start praying.<br> Get the blankets, put them<br> over that passengers' head.<br> Get that flight attendant to help you.<br> It's not quite been your day, has it, mate?<br> Cover yourself up. Cover yourself up.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> I think they're getting off.<br> Getting off the plane?<br> In midair?<br> No talking!<br> They're taking this detour<br> and jumping off the plane.<br> Why do you think we're descending?<br> But the stewardess said that we...<br> I don't care what the stewardess said.<br> For all we know, she's one of them.<br> What gives you the right to decide<br> to put us all in jeopardy?<br> I don't know where you been, buddy,<br> but we're already in jeopardy. Be quiet.<br> Hey. Hey.<br> Do you have a plan?<br> Yeah, kill the hijackers, take back the plane.<br> Maybe we should ask other passengers.<br> Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.<br> Most of these people don't even speak English.<br> You must feel like a pretty big<br> man, killing innocent people.<br> Hey! I said no talking!<br> Captain. What's going on?<br> We're down to 18,000 feet.<br> It's getting bumpy.<br> Explosives ready.<br> The cabin door is now rigged with explosives,<br> so don't try anything stupid.<br> You take me down below 10 and keep it steady.<br> I got a precious cargo back here.<br> Arlo?<br> Arlo?<br> Arlo?<br> Where's Arlo?<br> I don't know.<br> Well, he doesn't just disappear. Go find him.<br> Arlo.<br> Arlo, where are you?<br> Arlo?<br> You gotta distract this guy.<br> I've got blood all over me.<br> Hey, hey, where are you going?<br> I gotta use the bathroom.<br> Sit.<br> Look, if I'm going to die,<br> I don't want to die in a puddle of...<br> I said get back in your seat.<br> Come on, man, what's the harm?<br> I said sit back down!<br> What's going on?<br> He want to go to...<br> He has to go where?<br> To the bathroom.<br> He has to go to the bathroom.<br> I'm sorry, nature calls.<br> I'm sorry, too.<br> Captain.<br> Captain, it's Dao.<br> You can open up now.<br> It's all clear. You can open up.<br> Why don't you try the intercom?<br> I'm gonna go see what's going<br> on with the passengers.<br> Right.<br> You had that coming.<br> I'll take that for the company.<br> Before that chip, Chad, you were nothin'.<br> You don't know how lucky you are.<br> Lucky. I didn't ask for any of it!<br> Maybe you didn't,<br> but that chip has the power to change the world.<br> It's a symbol of freedom.<br> You are the future of mankind, Mr. Turner.<br> Yeah?<br> It would have been nice if I had the choice.<br> What's going on?<br> OK, everybody, just try to calm down, OK?<br> Calm down.<br> What's going on?<br> What-what did the captain say?<br> I couldn't reach him on the intercom.<br> Is the intercom broken? I mean what...?<br> No, I checked. It's working.<br> It's just the clothes left behind.<br> It's nothing but piles of clothes<br> where people used to be.<br> All life has meaning and purpose.<br> It all does.<br> I know you don't understand,<br> but one day, you will.<br> Let me call you a cab.<br> When the time comes,<br> God will reveal your plan to you.<br> You know the Bible says,<br> "Blessed are those who read and hear the prophecy<br> and take it to heart because the time is near. "<br> They just vanished.<br> There are dozens of passengers missing.<br> How is that possible?<br> I don't know. I don't know!<br> Just try to-try to keep<br> these people calmed down.<br> It's the Rapture.<br> I always thought that... I<br> was a good enough person<br> with all that I was doing for the Lord.<br> Now, I realize that just doing good<br> does not secure a place for us in heaven.<br> I never fully accepted that 'til now,<br> even though I preached it for years.<br> God has taken those that believe in him.<br> Where are the missing passengers?<br> I wanna see the captain.<br> What about my husband?<br> Did he believe in the Bible and its teachings?<br> Why are you asking me this?<br> Did he?<br> He did.<br> Everybody listen...<br> All we need to worry about...<br> is getting this plane safely<br> on the ground, nothing else.<br> Look, a blast like that can<br> just bring the plane down.<br> We survived the last blast, didn't we?<br> We were lucky.<br> Not only that, there's something<br> else you should know.<br> We're headed back to Bangkok.<br> Why is that?<br> It's protocol in emergency situations.<br> I could tell the captain turned<br> the plane back to Bangkok<br> when we tried to retake the plane.<br> Alright, well, how long 'til we reach Bangkok?<br> About 30 minutes.<br> Then we're wasting time. One thing's for sure.<br> We do nothing, this plane goes down.<br> You don't know that.<br> Come on, the captain could be passed out.<br> He could still come to.<br> We can't count on that.<br> Our only option is to blow the door.<br> I got a better suggestion.<br> We have to act right now. Time is everything.<br> What do you think?<br> There may be another way.<br> Alright, I'm in.<br> OK, look for the door in the forward bulkhead.<br> I don't see anything.<br> OK, well, maybe it got damaged in the blast.<br> Can you feel around?<br> There should be some cold air coming through.<br> Cold air's coming from over here somewhere.<br> Alright, I got it.<br> OK, good. Can you get in?<br> It looks like the explosion jammed it shut.<br> Looks like we're gonna have<br> to blow the door after all,<br> like I said.<br> No, wait, wait. OK, Chad, listen.<br> There are two seams in the bulkhead,<br> one on either side of the plane.<br> Can you just see if either one<br> of them is torn or ruptured?<br> Probably gonna need some kind of<br> a crowbar, tool of some kind.<br> I'll see if I can find something down here.<br> No, nah, nah, nah, nah,<br> passengers can't bring anything<br> like that on a plane anymore.<br> I don't see anything. Do you<br> have any tools up there?<br> Well, yeah, in the cockpit.<br> Everything we have now is plastic.<br> Yeah, even the plastic explosive.<br> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<br> I got all the tools you need right here.<br> If I can get down there with<br> a couple other strong guys,<br> we'll pull that bulkhead right off the wall,<br> if that's what it takes.<br> The fire melted the seam of this thing.<br> I just can't...<br> You wanna give it a shot?<br> Got a little light?<br> Chad?<br> What's going on down there?<br> He's running out of time.<br> Shh! Chad?<br> Chad?<br> Dao, pry-bar snapped.<br> Maybe the only way to... to<br> do this is to blow the door.<br> What's he saying?<br> Tell him he's running out of time.<br> He's running out of time when the captain says<br> he's running out of time!<br> Chad?<br> I don't know what else to do.<br> I don't have any more options.<br> You've had a rough day.<br> Yeah, sure wasn't what I was expecting<br> when I was shaving this morning.<br> Yeah, me neither.<br> Hey.<br> I just want to say thanks<br> for everything you've done.<br> You've got us this far.<br> You think that's really what<br> happened, all those folks,<br> that it was the Rapture...<br> and those that believe in Jesus Christ were taken<br> and the rest of us were, uh, left behind?<br> There is no other explanation.<br> It's impossible.<br> And the only one that can<br> do the impossible is God.<br> Hey, I have faith we can do this together.<br> I could use a little faith right now.<br> Dao, we're going in.<br> We're gonna do this.<br> OK! They can do it!<br> He's got 10 minutes.<br> Alright, let's get these boxes out of the way.<br> I've got an idea.<br> Alright, let's ram this.<br> One...<br> two...<br> three!<br> I'm in.<br> Man, it is freezing in here.<br> They have to keep the avionics cold<br> so it's gonna be a little tight, alright?<br> OK, you're gonna have to crawl between<br> the instrument racks towards the nose.<br> Almost all the way to the front<br> of the plane should be a hatch<br> to the cockpit; on it should<br> be a handle with a latch.<br> Turn it and press upwards.<br> Has he reached the cockpit yet?<br> Chad?<br> Chad, what's going on down there?<br> Found the hatch, but it's not budging.<br> You think this thing could be locked<br> from the, uh, from the cockpit?<br> Come in, people. Can you hear me?<br> - I'm going back down there.<br> - Wait, wait, wait!<br> Chad? Chad, you're just gonna<br> have to find another way.<br> We have another way.<br> Chad, you're running out of time.<br> Give me 5 more minutes, OK?<br> Five more minutes.<br> What for?<br> Five minutes, please?<br> Not a second more.<br> OK.<br> Alright, Chad, what do you need?<br> Does anybody up there know<br> what kind of cooling system<br> the avionics runs on?<br> On the newer planes with<br> more advanced electronics,<br> they run liquid cooling systems now.<br> It's possibly liquid nitrogen.<br> Yeah, gotcha.<br> Chad, what are you doing?<br> I'm just gonna try a little college experiment.<br> We've got a problem down here.<br> Chad, what's going on?<br> I think I found a radio jamming device.<br> Hey, hey, hey, hey, whatever he does,<br> do not disconnect the liquid nitrogen pumps, OK?<br> Those high-powered CPUs will start to overheat<br> and they're gonna overtake the<br> plane's entire navigation<br> and guidance systems.<br> - Chad?<br> - Three minutes.<br> Three thousand feet.<br> What?<br> Wait, what did you say?<br> Ted says whatever you do,<br> don't disconnect the liquid nitrogen pumps.<br> Chad?<br> Lord, give me strength.<br> Did you hear me?<br> Chad?<br> Chad?<br> Is everybody OK?<br> Are you OK?<br> Everybody OK?<br> We're gonna blow that door, now.<br> Wait.<br> Chad? Chad, this is Dao.<br> I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can,<br> I just want you to know that<br> we all still believe in you<br> and you're gonna walk through<br> that door any minute now.<br> Blow that door, now!<br> But if you can't,<br> I'm praying that we're gonna<br> make it through this.<br> OK, I don't know why you're not answering me<br> but I assume there's a really good reason<br> and you're gonna walk through<br> that door any minute now<br> and if you just...<br> Chad, if you can hear me,<br> I'm gonna blow that door.<br> No!<br> Everybody step back.<br> Step back.<br> Get back behind the partition.<br> OK, I've got it set for 2 minutes.<br> On the count of three.<br> One...<br> two...<br> three!<br> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, it's Chad.<br> OK, it's Chad.<br> Hey, Cooper.<br> Have a little faith.<br> Can you just go ahead and remove that bomb<br> so he can get through?<br> Good for you, pal.<br> But I wouldn't be celebrating just yet.<br> You're freezing.<br> We still got a plane to land.<br> Let's do it.<br> The Rapture.<br> Alright, how's it looking?<br> OK, she's OK.<br> Thirty-five people missing from my flight.<br> It's not possible.<br> Entire east end of Bangkok is on fire...<br> Tokyo is burning out of control...<br> Looters swarming through<br> the streets of Singapore.<br> So it's true.<br> It's really happening.<br> Well, at least we're safe.<br> No, no, no, we're not.<br> We still got a bomb to take care of.<br> There's a bomb attached to an altimeter,<br> and it looks to me as if we go below 3,000 feet<br> that it's-it's gonna blow.<br> They teach you how to disarm those things<br> in flight attendant school?<br> Well, they did, actually. I was sick that day.<br> Why can't we just toss it out,<br> I mean, toss it out of the plane?<br> Is that... is that poss...<br> I mean, what do you think?<br> Well, in theory it could work.<br> If I get the plane below 8,000 feet,<br> depressurize the cabin,<br> you go down below, open the rear cargo door,<br> throw the... it out.<br> By the time we hit 3,000 feet,<br> the bomb will be triggered,<br> we'll be miles away.<br> Can we fly with the door open?<br> Well, technically, you can land a<br> plane with the door open so...<br> Well, I don't think we should<br> let the passengers know, though.<br> They've been through a lot of trauma already.<br> That's OK, I'll just, I'll tell them I<br> have to depressurize the plane<br> as a safety precaution before we<br> land because of the explosion.<br> How are we gonna get a bomb down<br> through the passenger cabin<br> without anybody knowing it?<br> I can take care of that.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, as a safety precaution,<br> we'll be depressurizing the<br> plane during our descent,<br> so please, fasten your seatbelts.<br> Be right back.<br> Cheer up, Mr. Turner.<br> You're a part of something that's on the verge<br> of changing the world.<br> Don't forget that.<br> Hey, hey, hey.<br> Listen, this chip.<br> It's not a good thing for the world like he says.<br> I can feel it.<br> This doesn't feel like God's work.<br> It feels like something else.<br> What do you mean?<br> I know this sounds crazy, but... the chip...<br> it's in the Bible.<br> It's the Mark of the Beast.<br> Alright, Ted, we're in now.<br> We gotta get this thing out of here<br> before we hit 3,000 feet.<br> OK. I'm gonna open the door.<br> Go ahead and open it up.<br> Hold on!<br> Hold on!<br> You two make a good team.<br> OK, Ted, the bomb is gone.<br> We're all clear.<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm done.<br> I don't wanna be a part of any of this any more.<br> Doesn't matter what you want.<br> I've got a job to do<br> and that's to deliver you, as<br> planned, to the G20 Summit.<br> I'm afraid I can't do that.<br> You don't have a choice, pal.<br> You're not gonna shoot me.<br> You need me and you need the chip.<br> You're right.<br> I do need ya.<br> But I don't need her.<br> You make one false move, I will shoot her.<br> Got it?<br> Throw the chutes out, both of them.<br> That one, too.<br> I don't want you to get any<br> crazy ideas about jumping.<br> Oh!<br> Let him go!<br> Let him go, now!<br> It's OK.<br> We're OK.<br> Where do you think you're gonna go?<br> My guys are waiting on the ground,<br> at the airport, on the ramp.<br> You'll never make it off this plane.<br> I've already delivered you.<br> You're just too dumb to realize it.<br> Yeah? You're the one who's all trussed up<br> like a pig on a spit.<br> How you gonna explain to<br> your boss how that happened<br> to a smart guy like you, huh?<br> Go ahead, jump.<br> You're chipped.<br> I'll find you.<br> But if you jump, know this:<br> She goes to prison for the rest of her life.<br> She'll be arrested as soon as we land.<br> Aiding and abetting a fugitive,<br> interfering with a federal officer,<br> theft of government property, conspiracy.<br> She'll spend the rest of her life in prison.<br> But if you stay...<br> we're all heros.<br> We'll be rich.<br> What happened up here, all<br> those people disappearing,<br> if that was the Rapture,<br> then this chip has a whole new meaning<br> and I'm not gonna let it<br> fall into the wrong hands.<br> I'm out of here.<br> I'm going with you!<br> How romantic.<br> You've got one parachute, there's two of ya.<br> You jump out there, you'll both die.<br> Tell the captain we're getting off early.<br> Ted, you're gonna have to land<br> this thing with the door open.<br> We're getting off early.<br> I will find you, Mr. Turner.<br> No matter where you run,<br> I will find you and I will bring you back.<br> You know what? You were right.<br> We do make a good team.<br> Ready?<br> You lost him, didn't you?<br> Global confusion is unfolding at this hour<br> as reports are flooding in from around the world.<br> Tens of thousands of people are missing,<br> many of them are children<br> and without explanation.<br> Adding to the chaos, a rash<br> of extreme natural disasters<br> has blanketed areas around the world.<br> Reports of tsunamis, earthquakes, violent storms<br> struck every continent.<br> Government and scientists have<br> offered no concrete answers,<br> and officials are racing to calm public fears<br> in an attempt to avoid widespread panic.<br> - Yes?<br> - Tell me about this chip.<br> The Avanti chip is the solution<br> along with finding the leader,<br> someone who understands technology,<br> world economics,<br> as well as social and spiritual ramifications.<br> I've spoken to my advisors.<br> They tell me you know a lot about it.<br> Well, yes, I do.<br> And if you think I can help, please...<br> We need you in Berlin.<br> - I understand.<br> - Now.<br> I'll leave immediately.<br> See you soon.<br> "The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. "<br> It has begun.<br> Why didn't you kill him?<br> 'Cause of what my brother said<br> to me about having a purpose.<br> That moment when I held his life in my hands,<br> it all made sense to me.<br> Don't worry, it's gonna be OK.<br> Looks like we're right over the city.<br> Look! It's the end of the world!<br> My brother would have said...<br> it's a new beginning.<br> My brother would have said...<br> have faith.<br>
