                        THE<br> MARTIAN<br> MARS<br> ACIDALIA PLANITIA<br> NASA - ARES III - LANDING SITE<br> Alright team,<br> stay in sight of each other.<br> Let's make NASA proud today.<br> How's it looking over there, Watney?<br> Well, you'll be happy<br> to hear that in<br> grid section 14 to 28,<br> the particles were phenomenally coarse,<br> and on 29, they're...<br> they're much finer,<br> which should be ideal<br> for chemical analysis.<br> Oh, wow.<br> Did everybody hear that?<br> Mark just discovered dirt.<br> Should we alert the media?<br> It's alright.<br> What're you doing today, Martinez?<br> Making sure that the MAV<br> is still upright.<br> Well, I like you know that<br> visual inspection of the equipment<br> is imperative to mission success.<br> I also like to report<br> that the MAV is still upright.<br> Watney, you're keep leaving<br> your channel open,<br> which leads to Martinez responding,<br> which leads to all our listening,<br> which leads to me being annoyed.<br> Roger that. Martinez, the captain<br> would like you to please...<br> shut your smart mouth.<br> We prefer to use a different adjective<br> to describe Martinez's mouth.<br> - Oh, did Beck just insult me?<br> - Dr. Beck, and, yes.<br> I'll be happy to turn the radios off<br> from here, commander.<br> Just say the word.<br> Hey, Johanssen.<br> Constant communication is the whole...<br> Shut him off.<br> Apologise for my countrymen, Vogel.<br> Accepted. How many samples<br> do we need, commander.<br> 7,<br> a hundred grams each.<br> [ EMERGENCY ]<br> MISSION STATUS UPDATE<br> We have a mission update.<br> Storm warning.<br> Commander, you should come inside.<br> You're going to want to see this.<br> - What is it?<br> - Storm warning.<br> I saw that in this morning's briefing.<br> We'll be inside before it hits.<br> Yeah.<br> They-They upgraded their estimate.<br> The storm is going<br> to be a lot worse.<br> Martinez, how's it look?<br> Not good.<br> 1200 km in diameter<br> bearing 24.41 degrees<br> That's trekking right towards us.<br> Base on current estimation,<br> estimated force of 8600 Newtons.<br> - What's the abort force.<br> - 7500.<br> Anything more than that<br> and the MAV will tip.<br> - Do we scrub.<br> - Begin abort procedure.<br> We are estimating where the marginal error<br> would be... could we wait it out?<br> Let's wait it out.<br> Let's wait it out.<br> Commander.<br> Prep emergency departure.<br> - Commander.<br> - We're scrubbed, that's an order.<br> Martinez, how long before take off?<br> 10 minutes.<br> Visibility is almost zero.<br> Anyone gets lost,<br> home in on my suit's telemetry.<br> - You ready?<br> - Ready!<br> - Commander, are you okay?<br> - I'm okay.<br> Commander, we're at 10 degrees,<br> and the MAV's going to tip at 12.3<br> Hey! We might be able to<br> keep the MAV from tipping.<br> How?<br> Use the cables from<br> the solar farm as guylines!<br> Anchor it with a Rover!<br> Watch out!<br> Aahhhhh!<br> Watney!<br> WARNING<br> SUIT BREACH DETECTED.<br> - What happened?<br> - He was hit.<br> Watney, report.<br> Before we lose telemetry,<br> his decompression alarm went off.<br> - Johanssen, where did you last see him?<br> - He's offline.<br> - I can't, I don't know where he is.<br> - What are the vitals on his suit.<br> - He's offline. He's offline.<br> - Negative. Complete lost of signal on Watney.<br> - Mitch?<br> - Yeah.<br> How long can he<br> survive decompression?<br> Less than a minute.<br> Line up.<br> Walk west.<br> He maybe prone,<br> we don't want to step over him.<br> Commander, we're at<br> 10.5 degrees, tilting to 11.<br> We got a gust of wind.<br> Copy that.<br> Everyone, home in on Martinez's suit.<br> It'll get you to the airlock.<br> Get in, prep for launch.<br> What about you, commander?<br> I'm going to search a little longer.<br> Keep moving.<br> Go!<br> Watney.<br> Watney, report.<br> The MAV is at 11.6 degrees.<br> Once good gust and we're tipping.<br> If it tips, you launch.<br> You really think I'm<br> going to leave you behind?<br> That's an order, Martinez.<br> Mark!<br> Mark.<br> Can you hear me?<br> Martinez, what about the proximity radar?<br> Could that detect,<br> Watney's suit.<br> Uh. It's made to see<br> the Hermes in orbit,<br> not a little piece of metal<br> put in a single suit.<br> - Give it a try.<br> - Roger.<br> What is she thinking? She knows the<br> infrared can't get through a sand storm.<br> She is grasping for anything.<br> We got negative contact<br> on the proximity radar.<br> - Nothing?<br> - Nah.<br> I can barely see the Hab.<br> Commander, I know you<br> don't want to hear this but...<br> Mark is dead.<br> Commander.<br> Hey. What the hell is<br> wrong with you, man?<br> My friend just died, I don't want<br> my commander to die too.<br> [ STABILITY WARNING ]<br> -11.2 degrees<br> WE'LL COME BACK!<br> Commander, you need to<br> get back to the ship, now.<br> 13 degrees.<br> If we past balance,<br> we'll never rock back.<br> I got one more trick left, and<br> then I'm following orders, commander.<br> You're firing the OMS?<br> That's right.<br> Commander!<br> On my way.<br> [ -12.9 degree -12.9 ]<br> Johanssen, let's go.<br> Mark.<br> We're 11.5 and holding.<br> Ready to go on your command.<br> Ready to launch.<br> Commander.<br> I need you to verbally<br> tell me whether or not to.<br> Launch.<br> At around 4:30 AM,<br> central standard time,<br> our satellites detected a storm<br> approaching the Ares 3<br> mission site on Mars.<br> At 6:45, the storm has<br> escalated to severe<br> and we have no choice<br> but to abort the mission.<br> Thanks to the quick action<br> of Captain Lewis,<br> astronaut Beck, Johanssen,<br> Martinez and Vogel<br> were all able to reach<br> the Mars ascend vehicle.<br> And performed an emergency launch<br> at 7:28 central time.<br> Unfortunately during the evacuation,<br> astronaut Mark Watney was<br> struck by debris and killed.<br> Commander Lewis and the rest of her team<br> were able to intercept safety<br> with the Hermes and<br> now are heading home.<br> But Mark Watney,<br> is dead.<br> - Mr. Sanders.<br> - Mr. Sanders.<br> - Mr. Sanders.<br> - Mr. Sanders!<br> OXYGEN LEVEL: CRITICAL<br> OXYGEN LEVEL: CRITICAL<br> OXYGEN LEVEL: CRITI...<br> PRESSURE: STABLE<br> AWWWW!<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> [MISSON DAY: SOL 19]<br> Hello, this is Mark Watney, astronaut.<br> I'm entering this log for the record,<br> because, in case I don't make it.<br> It is 06:53<br> on Sol 19, and<br> I'm alive.<br> Obviously.<br> But...<br> I'm guessing that's going to come as a<br> surprise to my crew mates and to NASA.<br> And to the entire world, really.<br> So...<br> Surprise.<br> I did not die on Sol 18 and<br> best I can figure.<br> This length of our primary<br> communication antenna broke off<br> and threw it through my bio-monitor.<br> and ripped a hole in me as well.<br> But the antenna<br> and the blood really<br> managed to seal the breach<br> in my suit which kept me alive,<br> even though the crew must<br> have thought I was dead.<br> I have no way to contact NASA.<br> And even if I could,<br> it's going to be...<br> 4 years until a manned mission<br> can reach me.<br> And I'm in a Hab<br> designed to last 31 days.<br> If the oxygenator breaks,<br> I'm going to suffocate.<br> If the water reclaimer breaks,<br> I'll die of thirst.<br> If the Hab breaches,<br> I'm just kind of... implode.<br> And if by some miracle<br> none of that happens,<br> eventually I'm going to<br> run out of food.<br> So.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> [hab]<br> I'm not going to die here.<br> SOL 21<br> 35, 36.<br> Sweet & Sour chicken.<br> [ VAC FLUSH ]<br> Alright. Let's do the math.<br> [SOL 21]<br> Our service mission here<br> was suppose to last<br> for 31 Sols. For redundancy<br> they sent 68 Sols worth of food,<br> that's for 6 people.<br> So for just me,<br> that's going to last 300 Sols.<br> Which I figure I could stretch<br> to 400 if I ration. So...<br> I got to figure out a way,<br> to grow<br> 3 years worth of food here.<br> On a planet where nothing grows.<br> Luckily.<br> I'm a botanist.<br> And Mars,<br> will come to fear<br> my botany powers.<br> ORGANIC<br> WASTE<br> BIOHAZARD<br> HUMAN - WASTE<br> [ M. WATNEY ]<br> SOL 22<br> PRESSURE: STABLE<br> Staple came out.<br> SOL 24<br> Fuck you, Mars.<br> SOL 31<br> Johanssen, Jesus.<br> SOL 36<br> The problem is water.<br> I have created<br> 126 square meters of soil.<br> And every cubic meter of soil<br> requires 48 liters of water<br> to be farm with.<br> So, I'm got to make<br> a lot more water.<br> Good thing is that I know the recipe.<br> You take hydrogen, you add oxygen,<br> you burn them.

Watney.<br> There's a mood of tension and anxiety<br> here, outside Johnson Space Center.<br> As you can see,<br> many people have gathered here,<br> To see whether or not, the mission to<br> retrieve Mark Watney will be a success.<br> Remember, they had some kind<br> of contact with him.<br> but it hasn't been very much.<br> We have to remind our viewers<br> that we're watching this as it unfolds<br> and we'll try to keep you up to date<br> as to what exactly is going on.<br> Let's listen in to NASA,<br> making contact with Mark Watney.<br> Let's listen in.<br> If something goes wrong,<br> What can Mission Control do?<br> Not a damn thing.<br> It's all happening<br> 12 light minutes away,<br> which means it takes 24 minutes for them<br> to get the answer to any question they ask.<br> Our launch is just 12 minutes,<br> so...<br> They're on their own.<br> CNSA HEADQUARTERS<br> BEIJING<br> Today, people have gathered in front of<br> the TVs in Beijing and all over the world,<br> watching attentively at the rescue mission which<br> have caught the attention of the whole world.<br> This rescue made possible,<br> is due to China NSA's selfless...<br> TRAFALGAR SQUARE<br> LONDON<br> Mark has been<br> completely alone on Mars.<br> According to psychology expert,<br> they said...<br> Fuel pressure green.<br> Engine alignment perfect.<br> Communications 5 by 5.<br> We are ready for<br> preflight checklist, Commander.<br> Mission Control, this is Hermes Actual.<br> We will proceed on schedule.<br> We are T minus 2 min 10 sec<br> to launch, by the mark.<br> About 2 minutes, Watney.<br> How are you doing down there?<br> I'm good.<br> I'm anxious to<br> get up to you.<br> Thanks for coming back for me.<br> Yeah.<br> We're on it.<br> Remember, you'll be<br> pulling some serious g's.<br> So, it's okay to pass out.<br> You're in Martinez's hands now.<br> Well.<br> Tell that asshole no barrel rolls.<br> Copy that, MAV.<br> CAPCOM.<br> Go.<br> Remote Command.<br> Go.<br> Recovery.<br> Go.<br> Secondary recovery.<br> Go.<br> Pilot.<br> Go.<br> Pilot.<br> Go.<br> Copy.<br> We're a go.<br> Mission Control.<br> We are go for launch.<br> T minus 10,<br> - 9.<br> - Main engine start.<br> Mooring clamps released.<br> About 5 seconds, Watney.<br> Hang on.<br> See you in a few, Commander.<br> Velocity, 741 meters per second.<br> Altitude, 1350 meters.<br> It's too low.<br> I know.<br> It's fighting me.<br> Watney, do you read?<br> Booster separation complete.<br> Velocity, 850.<br> Altitude, 1843.<br> He's way below target altitude.<br> How-How far below?<br> Checking.<br> Watney, do you read?<br> He's probably passed out<br> He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.<br> Give him a few minutes.<br> Copy that.<br> Main shutdown in 3,<br> 2,<br> Shutdown.<br> Back to automatic guidance.<br> Shutdown confirmed.<br> Fuel reserve depleted.<br> Watney,<br> do you read?<br> There seems to be some sort<br> of problem with the transmission.<br> I have interval pings.<br> Intercept velocity will be<br> 11 meters per second.<br> I can make that work.<br> Distance at intercept will be...<br> We'll be 68 km apart.<br> 68 km?<br> Did she just say 68 km?<br> Come on, guys, keep it together.<br> Work the problem.<br> Johanssen, time to intercept?<br> 39 minutes 12 seconds.<br> Martinez, what if we point<br> our thrusters in the same direction?<br> Well, it depends on how much<br> fuel you want to save<br> for the altitude adjustments<br> for the trip home.<br> How much do you need?<br> I can get by with about 20%<br> of what we have left.<br> If we use 75.5% of remaining<br> altitude adjustment fuel,<br> That'll bring the intercept range to zero.<br> Do this.<br> Hang on.<br> It brings the range to zero,<br> but the intercept velocity will be<br> 42 meters per second.<br> And it's way too fast.<br> Then, we have 39 minutes<br> to figure out how to slow down.<br> Martinez, burn the jets.<br> Copy that.<br> Mav to Hermes.<br> Watney?<br> Affirmative.<br> What's your status?<br> My chest hurts.<br> I have broken my ribs.<br> How are you?<br> We're working on getting to you.<br> There was a complication during the launch.<br> Copy that.<br> Well, how bad is it?<br> Well, we corrected the intercept range,<br> but we got a problem with intercept velocity.<br> How big a problem?<br> 42 meters per second.<br> Well,<br> shit.<br> Commander, I have an idea.<br> Go ahead, Mark.<br> Well, If I can find something<br> sharp in here<br> and poke a hole in the<br> glove of my EVA suit.<br> I could use the escaping air<br> as a thruster<br> and fly towards you.<br> It would be easy to control,<br> because it would be on my arm.<br> I can't see you having any control<br> if you did that.<br> You'd be eyeballing the intercept using<br> a thrust vector you can barely controls<br> Yes. Yes.<br> Those are all very good points.<br> But, consider this:<br> I'd get to fly around<br> like Iron Man.<br> Commander,<br> let's go Iron Man.<br> This is unexpected, LOS.<br> Communication lost.<br> Standby.<br> Maybe it's not the worst idea.<br> No, it is the worst idea.<br> It's the worst idea ever.<br> Not what he said.<br> Using atmosphere as thrust.<br> What happens if we blow the VAL?<br> What? You want to open<br> the vehicular airlock?<br> It'd give us a good kick.<br> Yeah, but it will also blow<br> the nose off the ship.<br> And all the air will leave,<br> and we need air to not die.<br> We'll seal the bridge<br> and the reactor room.<br> Everywhere else will go vacuo.<br> Vogel.<br> Go ahead, Commander.<br> I need you to come inside<br> and make a... bomb.<br> Uh.<br> Again, Commander?<br> You're a chemist.<br> Can you make a bomb with<br> what you have on board?<br> Probably.<br> But I feel obliged to mention that<br> setting off an explosive device<br> in a spacecraft is a<br> terrible terrible idea.<br> Hang on. You guys making<br> a bomb without me?<br> Copy that.<br> Can you do it?<br> Yeah.<br> Houston. Be advised we're going to<br> deliberately breach the VAL<br> - to produce some reverse thrust.<br> - What?<br> Beck, leave your suit on,<br> meet Johanssen in airlock 1.<br> We'll open the outer door.<br> I need you to place the charge<br> on the inner door.<br> Climb back to airlock 2<br> along the hull.<br> Copy.<br> I'm on my way.<br> I'm in, Commander.<br> Copy that.<br> Vogel, where are you?<br> - I'm in the kitchen.<br> - Okay.<br> Commander,<br> I can't let you<br> go through with this.<br> I am prepared to cut the suit.<br> Absolutely not.<br> Well, see.<br> The thing is, I'm selfish.<br> I want all the memorials<br> back home to be about me.<br> Just me.<br> I should have<br> left this guy on Mars.<br> Hey.<br> -Sugar?<br> - Yeah.<br> Can you hold this?<br> Liquid oxygen.<br> Add some stain remover<br> that contains ammonia.<br> This thing here,<br> is 5 times stronger than<br> a stick of dynamite.<br> How do we activate it?<br> You can connect this to<br> one of your lighting panels.<br> Careful.<br> Open airlock 1.<br> I'm on the way to Beck.<br> I just hope this is a<br> good idea, guys.<br> - It is.<br> - Open A1.<br> Hi.<br> You have it?<br> Make sure you're not in here<br> when this thing goes off.<br> Hey.<br> Be Careful out there.<br> In space.<br> Don't tell anyone I did that.<br> Bomb set.<br> Leaving airlock 1.<br> Guys, I'm running the numbers,<br> even with optimum VAL blow,<br> We're going to be off<br> on our angle.<br> What's the intercept distance?<br> Johanssen?<br> 260 meters to approximate.<br> It's too far.<br> Commander?<br> Martinez, close the door.<br> Open D3.<br> Leave it open.<br> Open B2.<br> Johanssen,<br> Time to VAL blow after initiate?<br> 15 seconds.<br> We sure know how<br> to cut it close.<br> Commander.<br> The distance is too far,<br> I'm going out.<br> - I can do this.<br> - It's not a debate.<br> I'm not risking another crew member.<br> Beck's returned.<br> Johanssen, initiate the bomb.<br> 10 seconds.<br> Strap in.<br> -Deceleration!<br> -2,<br> Activating the panel 41.<br> Bridge seal holding.<br> - What's the damage?<br> - Worry about that later.<br> What's the relative velocity?<br> 12 meters per second.<br> Copy.<br> Hook me up.<br> Done.<br> I've visual of the MAV.<br> What's the intercept range?<br> I'm checking.<br> 312 meters.<br> Did you say 312?<br> Okay. I'll wave at<br> you guys as I go by.<br> Oh.<br> I can't get to you, Mark.<br> You're too far.<br> - I'm not going to make it<br> - I know.<br> Beck, unhook me.<br> I'm going after him.<br> Commander, I got this.<br> Mark, report.<br> On my way, Commander.<br> Damn it.<br> Johanssen, what's my<br> relative velocity to Mark?<br> 5.2 meters per second.<br> Copy.<br> Adjusting course.<br> 3.1 meters per second.<br> Distance to target 24 meters.<br> 11 meters to target.<br> 6 meters.<br> Hold on, Mark.<br> Come on.<br> I got him!<br> I got him.<br> I got him.<br> Way to go, Iron Man.<br> Beck, pull us in.<br> It's good to see you.<br> You...<br> have... terrible taste<br> in music.<br> Houston, this is Hermes Actual.<br> We got him.<br> YEAH!<br> Watney is secure.<br> YES! YES!<br> YES!<br> Contact in outer space,<br> with Mark Watney.<br> After a very long time, they have done<br> what many people thought was impossible.<br> Mark Watney has been successfully rescued.<br> Mark Watney has been rescued.<br> This has been an incredible mission.<br> Get a hold of him.<br> Hey-Hey, handsome.<br> Beck, close the hatch.<br> Hey, guys!<br> Houston, 6 crews safely aboard.<br> This is a huge moment<br> for this nation, for the world<br> and, in deed,<br> for international space travel.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> Oh god!<br> There's a little sloth going on<br> over there, man.<br> I know. I haven't had a shower<br> for a year and a half.<br> Don't make me laugh.<br> I have a broken rib.<br> Hey, there.<br> Good day, sir.<br> - It's an honor, sir.<br> - Sir.<br> - Sir.<br> - Sir.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> DAY 1<br> Welcome to the<br> Astronaut Candidate Program.<br> Now pay attention,<br> because this could save your life.<br> Trust me. I know what<br> I'm talking about.<br> Alright. Let me get a few things<br> out of the way, right off the bat.<br> Yes, I did in fact survive on a deserted<br> planet by farming in my own shit.<br> Yes, it's actually worse than it sound.<br> So, let's not talk about that ever again.<br> The other question<br> I get most frequently is.<br> When I was up there<br> stranded by myself,<br> Did I think I was going to die?<br> Yes, absolutely.<br> And that's when you need to know going in,<br> because it's going to happen to you.<br> This is space.<br> It does not cooperate.<br> At some point, everything's<br> going to go south on you.<br> Everything's going to go south<br> and you're going to say "This is it."<br> That is how I end.<br> Now you can either accept that,<br> or you can get to work.<br> That's all it is.<br> You just begin.<br> You do the math.<br> You solve one problem<br> and you solve the next one,<br> and then the next.<br> And If you solve enough problems,<br> you get to come home.<br> Alright.<br> Questions?<br> Once Mission Control complete<br> their preflight checks,<br> we'll begin launch procedures.<br> The Ares 5 team will<br> rendezvous with the Hermes<br> approximately 48 minutes after launch.<br> From there, they'll have 414 days<br> of space travel ahead of them.<br> Have the goals changed from the<br> previous mission to the Ares 5 program?<br> And what do you hope<br> to achieve this time around?<br> Well, no. The goals has always been<br> the same for the Ares Program.<br> This time, of course we hope to bring<br> all the astronauts back at the same time.<br> - Flight, Guidance check complete.<br> - Copy, Guidance.<br> This is Flight.<br> We are go for launch on schedule.<br> Final Aerial Service Check are complete.<br> As everything remains a go.<br> for the launch of the Ares 5.<br> 20 seconds.<br> Proceeding with the count.<br> T minus 10.<br> Main engine start.<br> 7, 6, 5, 4,<br> 3, 2, 1.<br> And liftoff.<br> As the crew of the Ares 5 begin the<br> next chapter of America's space exploration.<br> Pressure look good.<br> Woo!<br> Wow, good shot.<br> There it is. 5 years after the<br> rescue of astronaut Mark Watney,<br> the Ares 5 is on it's way to Mars.<br>
