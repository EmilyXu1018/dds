                        It happened that green and crazy summer<br> when Frankie was 12 years old.<br> This was the summer when, for a long time,<br> she had not been a member.<br> She belonged to no club,<br> and was a member of nothing in the world.<br> Frankie had become an un-joined person,<br> and she was afraid.<br> And there, on the last Friday of August,<br> all this was changed.<br> It was so sudden, that Frankie puzzled<br> the whole blank afternoon.<br> And still she did not understand.<br> - Are they cold enough?<br> - Just a minute!<br> Yes, they're cold enough.<br> And them other two drinks is lemonade<br> for you and John Henry.<br> It seems to me this old arbor has shrunk.<br> I remember when I was a child...<br> Look! Mint juleps!<br> Well!<br> Happiness to Janice and Jarvis.<br> It was such a surprise when Jarvis<br> wrote home you were going to be married.<br> I hope it wasn't a bad surprise.<br> Oh, heavens, no.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> if only you knew how I feel.<br> Frankie's been bending my ears, Son,<br> ever since your letter came,<br> going on about weddings and brides.<br> Papa!<br> It's lovely we can be married<br> at Jarvis' house.<br> It's what Jarvis' mother would have wanted.<br> Oh, it will be beautiful.<br> Pretty soon we should be pushing off<br> for Winter Hill.<br> I have to be back in barracks tonight.<br> Winter Hill is such a lovely, cold name.<br> It reminds me of ice and snow.<br> Ice and snow!<br> It was 102 at the base yesterday.<br> Oh, that feels so good!<br> Sister-in-law.<br> Doesn't that sound wonderful?<br> Yes, dear.<br> You notice if you fix your attention<br> on the words,<br> they begin to sound funny.<br> Sister-in-law, sister-in-law...<br> Frankie's crazy.<br> You should have seen the letter<br> she wrote to me.<br> I wrote you so many letters, Jarvis,<br> and you never answered me.<br> And I sent you so many boxes<br> of homemade fudge,<br> but you never, never answered me.<br> Oh, Frankie, you know how it is.<br> I never saw a human grow so fast<br> as Frankie in all my life.<br> Last time I saw her<br> she was only up to here on me.<br> I think maybe we ought to tie a brick<br> to her head.<br> - Jarvis, don't!<br> - Don't tease your little sister like that.<br> Why, I don't think Frankie's too tall.<br> And she probably won't grow much more.<br> I had the biggest portion of my growth<br> by the time I was 13.<br> But I'm just 12. When I think of all<br> the growing years ahead of me, I get scared.<br> I wouldn't worry.<br> You see,<br> I never believed in love until now.<br> Where does the music come from?<br> It sounds so close.<br> It is. It's just behind us.<br> They have club meetings and parties<br> with boys on Friday nights.<br> Hey, there!<br> I watch them here from the yard.<br> It must be nice,<br> having your clubhouse so near.<br> Well, I'm not a member now.<br> But they're holding an election<br> this afternoon.<br> Frankie thinks she'll be elected.<br> I don't care one way or the other.<br> Well, see you Sunday.<br> Drive carefully, Son. Goodbye, Janice.<br> - Goodbye. Thanks, Mr. Addams.<br> - Bye, Janice. Bye, Jarvis.<br> Goodbye, Frankie, darling.<br> I'd better go back to the store, now,<br> and get my nose down to the grindstone.<br> Bernice, you send John Henry home<br> for supper at 6:00. Don't wait for me.<br> Yes, sir, Mr. Addams.<br> You hear that, candy?<br> Your mama wants you home<br> some of the time.<br> I hear.<br> I just can't understand it.<br> - The way it all just suddenly happened.<br> - Happened? Happened?<br> - I've never been so puzzled.<br> - Puzzled by what?<br> The whole thing.<br> They are so beautiful.<br> I believe the sun's done fried your brains.<br> Me, too.<br> Look here at me.<br> - You jealous?<br> - Jealous?<br> Jealous because your brother's<br> going to be married?<br> No, I just never saw<br> any two people like them.<br> When they walked in the house today,<br> it was so queer.<br> You are jealous.<br> Go behold yourself in the mirror.<br> I can tell from the color of your eyes.<br> They were the two prettiest people<br> I ever saw.<br> I just can't understand how it happened.<br> - Whatever ails you? Acting so queer.<br> - I don't know.<br> I bet they have a good time<br> every minute of the day.<br> Let's us have a good time.<br> Us have a good time?<br> - Us?<br> - Yes, us.<br> Come on.<br> Let us play a three-handed game of bridge.<br> Janice and Jarvis.<br> Winter Hill. The wedding.<br> It's all so queer.<br> Can't bid. Never have a hand these days.<br> - A spade.<br> - I want to bid spades.<br> That's what I was going to bid.<br> Well, that's your tough luck. I bid them first.<br> Oh, you fool jackass! It's not fair!<br> Hush quarreling, you two.<br> Tell the truth, neither one of you got such<br> a grand hand to fight over the bid about.<br> But where is the cards?<br> I ain't had no kind of hand all week.<br> I don't give a darn about it.<br> It is immaterial with me.<br> My heart feels I'm going away.<br> Going farther and farther away<br> while I'm stuck here by myself.<br> You ain't here by yourself.<br> They were the two prettiest people<br> I ever saw.<br> Yet, it was...<br> It was like I couldn't see all of them<br> I wanted to see.<br> My brains couldn't gather together<br> quick enough to take it all in.<br> And then they were gone.<br> Well, stop commenting about it.<br> You don't have your mind on the game.<br> Well, spades are trump and you got a spade.<br> I have some of my mind on the game.<br> - Go on, cheater.<br> - Make haste, candy.<br> I can't. It's a king.<br> The only spade I got is a king.<br> And I don't want to play my king under<br> Frankie's ace, and I'm not going to, either!<br> See, Bernice, he cheats.<br> Play the king, John Henry. You know<br> you got to follow the rules of the game.<br> My king!<br> It isn't fair!<br> Even with this trick, I can't win.<br> Well, just where is the cards?<br> Three days, I ain't had a decent hand.<br> Begin to suspicion something, too.<br> Come on let's count these old cards.<br> We've worn these old cards out.<br> If you would eat these old cards,<br> they would taste<br> like a combination of all the dinners<br> of this summer<br> together with a sweaty-handed nasty taste.<br> Why, the jacks and the queens are missing!<br> John Henry,<br> how come you do a thing like that?<br> So that's why you asked for the scissors<br> and stole off quiet behind the arbor.<br> Why you take our playing cards<br> and cut out all the pictures?<br> 'Cause I wanted 'em. They're cute.<br> See, he's nothing but a child.<br> It's hopeless. Hopeless!<br> Just have to put him out of the game.<br> He's entirely too young.<br> Oh, no, we can't put candy out of the game.<br> Gotta have a third to play.<br> Besides, by the last count,<br> he owes me close to three million dollars.<br> Oh, I'm sick unto death!<br> Oh, I wish they'd taken me with them<br> to Winter Hill this afternoon.<br> I wish tomorrow was Sunday<br> instead of Saturday.<br> Sunday will come.<br> I doubt it.<br> I wish I was going somewhere for good.<br> I wish I had $100 and could just light out<br> and never see this town again.<br> Seems to me<br> like you're wishing for a lot of things.<br> I wish I was somebody else except me.<br> Frankie, you serious when you<br> gave me the doll a while ago?<br> It gives me a pain just to think about them.<br> It's a known truth<br> gray-eyed people is jealous.<br> - Let's go play with the children, Frankie.<br> - I don't want to.<br> - Let's go.<br> - You got ears, you heard me!<br> I think maybe I better go home.<br> You just can't eat dinner and then go<br> off in the afternoon like that.<br> I know it.<br> You can go home, candy lamb,<br> if you want to.<br> But let's go out, Frankie.<br> They sound like they're having a lot of fun.<br> No, they're not.<br> They're just a crowd of ugly, silly children.<br> Running and hollering.<br> Running and hollering. Nothing to it.<br> Look, those big girls!<br> Hey, there!<br> I'm mighty glad to see you. Come on in.<br> We can't. We were just passing through<br> to notify our new member.<br> Am I the new member?<br> No, you're not the one the club elected.<br> Not elected?<br> Every ballot was unanimous<br> for Mary Littlejohn.<br> Mary Littlejohn?<br> You mean that girl<br> that just moved in next door?<br> Pasty fat girl with those tacky pigtails?<br> The one who plays the piano all day long?<br> Yes. Mary is training for a concert career.<br> You don't have enough sense<br> to appreciate a talented girl like Mary.<br> What are you doing in my yard?<br> You're never to set foot<br> on my papa's property again!<br> You crooks!<br> I could shoot you with my papa's pistol!<br> Crooks!<br> Why didn't you elect me?<br> Why can't I be a member?<br> I wouldn't pay them club girls no mind.<br> All my life I've been wanting things<br> I ain't been getting.<br> Besides, them club girls<br> are fully two years older than you.<br> I think they've been spreading it<br> all over town that I smell bad.<br> When I had those boils<br> and had to use that black,<br> bitter-smelling ointment.<br> I know.<br> That old Helen Fletcher asked me<br> what was that funny smell I had.<br> I could shoot every one of them<br> with a pistol!<br> I don't think you smell so bad.<br> You smell sweet like a 100 flowers.<br> I bet I use more perfume<br> than anybody else in town.<br> Crooks!<br> And there was something else, too.<br> They were telling big lies about<br> grownup people.<br> I don't know what kind of fool<br> they take me for.<br> Keep telling you, they're too old for you.<br> Frankie, the whole idea of a club<br> is that there are members who are included<br> and the non-members who are not included.<br> Then what you ought to do is round you up<br> a club of your own.<br> That way you'd be the president yourself.<br> - Well, who would I get?<br> - Oh, the little boys and girls<br> you hear playing around here,<br> the neighborhood.<br> I don't want to be the president<br> of all those little young leftover people.<br> Well, go on and enjoy your misery.<br> I bet Janice and Jarvis are members<br> of a lot of clubs.<br> In fact, the Army is kind of like a club.<br> You've got two nickels and a dime.<br> Now, don't be rooting through<br> my pocketbook like that, candy.<br> That ain't nice, rooting through<br> folks' pocketbook.<br> They might get the idea<br> you're trying to steal their money.<br> I'm looking for your old blue glass eye.<br> Here it is.<br> That's my new eye. Give it here.<br> I still owe $64.23 on this eye.<br> Your old blue eye looked very cute.<br> Maybe the finance company will come out<br> and take it back.<br> They'll never repossess it while<br> I'm wearing it and I'm still the same size.<br> You got three eyes. Which one of them<br> do you see out of the best?<br> Left eye, precious. The glass eyes<br> don't do me no seeing good at all.<br> Janice and Jarvis.<br> It gives me this pain<br> just to think about them.<br> It's a known truth<br> gray-eyed people is jealous.<br> I told you I wasn't jealous!<br> I couldn't be jealous of one of them<br> unless I was jealous of them both.<br> I associate the two of them together.<br> Well, I was jealous when my<br> foster-brother, Honey, married Clorina.<br> I sent a warning I'd tear the ears clean<br> off her head. But you see I didn't.<br> She got ears just like everybody else.<br> J- A.<br> Janice and Jarvis.<br> Isn't that the strangest thing?<br> - What?<br> - J-A.<br> Both their names begin with J-A.<br> Well, what about it?<br> If only my name was<br> Jane or<br> Jasmine.<br> I don't follow your frame of mind.<br> Jarvis and Janice and Jasmine, see?<br> No, I don't see.<br> I wonder if it's against the law<br> to change your name or add to it.<br> Naturally, it's against the law.<br> Well, I don't care! F. Jasmine Addams!<br> You serious when you give me this?<br> I will name her Belle.<br> I don't know what went on in Jarvis' mind<br> when he brought me that doll.<br> Imagine bringing me a doll.<br> Your face when you unwrapped<br> that package sure was a study.<br> John Henry, quit picking at the doll's eyes,<br> it makes me so nervous. You hear me?<br> In fact, take that doll somewhere<br> out of my sight!<br> The big mistake I made<br> was to get this close crew cut.<br> For the wedding I ought to have<br> long brunette hair, don't you think so?<br> Don't see how come long brunette hair<br> is necessary.<br> But I warned you about getting your head<br> shaved off like that before you did it.<br> But nothing would do,<br> but you shave it off like that.<br> I'm so worried about being so tall.<br> I'm 12 and five-sixths years old.<br> Already I'm 5'5"<br> and three quarters inches tall.<br> If I keep growing like this until I'm 21,<br> I figure I'll be nearly 10 feet tall!<br> How tall, Frankie?<br> I doubt if they ever get married<br> or go to a wedding, those freaks.<br> - Freaks? What freaks are you talking about?<br> - The fair.<br> The ones we saw there last October.<br> Oh, the freaks at the fair.<br> She was the cutest little girl I ever saw.<br> I've never saw anything so cute<br> in my whole life.<br> - Did you, Frankie?<br> - No, I don't think she was cute.<br> Well, who is that he's talking about?<br> That little old pinhead at the fair.<br> Head no bigger than an orange.<br> The hair all shaved off<br> and a big pink bow at the top.<br> The bow was bigger than her head.<br> Well, that little-headed girl was cute.<br> The fact is all those freak folks<br> fairly give me the creeps.<br> Do I give you the creeps?<br> You?<br> Do you think I'll grow into a freak?<br> You? Certainly not, I trust heaven.<br> Well, do you think I will be pretty?<br> Maybe, if you file down<br> them horns an inch or two.<br> - Seriously.<br> - Seriously.<br> I think when you fill out,<br> you'll do very well, if you behave.<br> But by Sunday. I want to do something<br> to improve myself before the wedding.<br> Then get clean for a change.<br> Scrub them elbows. Fix yourself up nice.<br> You'll do very well.<br> You'll be all right<br> if you file down them horns.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> I just wish I would die.<br> - Well, die then.<br> - Die!<br> Go home! Go home!<br> You heard me. Go home!<br> - I'm sick and tired of you, you little midget!<br> - Now, just a minute...<br> - Will you listen to me...<br> - Go home!<br> Did you hear what I said?<br> What makes you act like that?<br> You're too mean to live.<br> I know it!<br> Something about John Henry<br> just gets on my nerves these days.<br> I've got a splinter in my foot.<br> That knife ain't no proper thing<br> for a splinter.<br> Seems to me that before this summer,<br> I always used to have such a good time.<br> Remember the spring,<br> how every Friday night Evelyn Owen<br> would come over and spend the night<br> with me? Or I'd go over to her house.<br> And then Evelyn had to go and move away<br> to Florida. Now she won't even write to me.<br> Don't that hurt you none?<br> Hurt anybody else except me.<br> Remember that show Evelyn and me put on?<br> Look ahead, look astern<br> Look the weather in the lee<br> - Blow high, blow low<br> - Blow high, blow low<br> - And so sailed we<br> - And so sailed we<br> You're going to meet another nice girl<br> like Evelyn Owen.<br> Frankie, what you need is a needle.<br> I don't care anything about my old feet!<br> How old were you, Bernice,<br> when you married your first husband?<br> and I ain't growed an inch since.<br> Can marriage really stop your growth?<br> Marriage don't stop nothing.<br> You never loved any of your four husbands<br> but Ludie.<br> Ludie Maxwell Freeman<br> was the only husband I loved.<br> The rest was just scraps.<br> Did you marry with a veil every time?<br> Three times with a veil.<br> If only I just knew where he's gone.<br> Charles!<br> Now, quit worrying about that old alley cat.<br> - He's gone off to hunt a friend.<br> - Charles!<br> - To hunt a friend?<br> - Certainly.<br> He roamed off to find himself a lady friend.<br> Well, why don't he bring<br> his friend home with him?<br> He ought to know I would be only too glad<br> to have a whole family of cats.<br> Well, you done seen the last<br> of that old alley cat.<br> I ought to notify the police force.<br> They will find Charles.<br> I wouldn't do that.<br> I want the police force, please.<br> Police force?<br> I'm notifying you about my cat.<br> Cat!<br> He's lost. He's almost pure Persian.<br> As Persian as I is!<br> But with short hair, a lovely color of gray,<br> with a little white spot at his throat.<br> And he answers to the name of Charles.<br> But if he don't answer to that,<br> he might come if you called, "Charlina. "<br> What?<br> Oh, my name is<br> Miss F. Jasmine Addams.<br> That gets it. That gets it.<br> And the address is 124 Grove Street.<br> Gal, they're coming in here and tie you up<br> and drag you off to Houghtonville.<br> Just picture them fat blue police<br> chasing tomcats up and down alleys, all,<br> "Come here, Charles, come here, Charlina!"<br> Merciful heavens!<br> Oh, shut up!<br> Trouble with you,<br> you got no sense of humor no more.<br> Maybe I'd be better off in jail.<br> Sit down, Frankie. You make me nervous.<br> I bet Janice and Jarvis<br> are almost to Winter Hill by now.<br> - Did you hear what Jarvis said?<br> - No. What?<br> They were talking about whether to vote<br> for C.P. MacDonald.<br> And Jarvis said,<br> "Why, I wouldn't vote for that scoundrel<br> "if he were running to be dog catcher. "<br> Why, I never heard anything<br> so witty in my life.<br> And you know what Janice remarked<br> when Jarvis mentioned<br> about how much I'd grown?<br> She said she didn't think I looked<br> so terribly big.<br> She said she got the major portion<br> of her growth before she was 13.<br> She said I was the right height,<br> and had acting talent,<br> and ought to go to Hollywood.<br> She did, Bernice.<br> Okay, all right. She did.<br> She said I was a lovely size<br> and I probably wouldn't grow any taller.<br> She said, anyway,<br> all fashion models and movie stars...<br> She did not, she did not.<br> I heard her from the window.<br> She only remarked<br> you had probably reached your growth.<br> But she didn't go on and on like that,<br> or mention anything about Hollywood.<br> - She said to you...<br> - She said to me...<br> That's a serious fault, Frankie.<br> Somebody just chance<br> to make a loose remark,<br> you've cozen in that mind of yours<br> till nobody would recognize it.<br> Like the time your Aunt Pat<br> mentioned you had sweet manners.<br> The next thing I know,<br> you was going all around bragging<br> how you had the finest manners in town,<br> you ought to go to Hollywood.<br> That's a serious fault.<br> Quit preaching at me!<br> I'm not preaching at you.<br> It's the solemn truth, and you know it.<br> - Well, I admit it.<br> - Well?<br> A little.<br> What I need to know is this.<br> Do you think I made a good impression?<br> - Impression?<br> - Yes?<br> Well, how would I know?<br> Well, I mean, how did I act? What did I do?<br> You didn't do nothing to speak of.<br> Nothing?<br> No, you just stood there. Watched the pair<br> of them like they were ghosts.<br> And when they start talking<br> about that wedding,<br> them ears of yours stiffened out<br> the size of cabbage leaves.<br> - They didn't!<br> - They did.<br> Someday you're going to find<br> that big fat tongue of yours<br> pulled out by the roots<br> and laying there before you on the table!<br> Oh, quit talking so rude.<br> I'm so scared<br> I didn't make a good impression.<br> Oh, come, sugar,<br> Bernice didn't mean it that way.<br> They were so pretty.<br> They must have such a good time,<br> and they went away and left me.<br> Frankie, I want you to sit up<br> and behave yourself.<br> They came and went away<br> and left me with this feeling!<br> I bet I know something.<br> Frankie's got a crush.<br> Frankie's got a crush.<br> Frankie's got a crush on the wedding.<br> - Quit it!<br> - Frankie's got a crush.<br> - Frankie's got a crush.<br> - You better quit!<br> Put that knife down.<br> - Make me.<br> - Put it down, devil.<br> Well, throw it.<br> I'm the best knife thrower in this town.<br> Say whatever contest, I would win.<br> Frances Addams, you're going to try<br> that stunt once too often.<br> Warned you to stop picking at me.<br> You just ain't fit to live in a house.<br> Won't be living in this one much longer.<br> I'm gonna run away from home!<br> Good riddance to a big old bag of rubbish.<br> You wait and see. I'm leaving town.<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> I don't know.<br> You're going crazy,<br> that's where you're going.<br> No.<br> This coming Sunday, after the wedding,<br> I'm leaving town.<br> And I swear by my two eyes<br> I'm never coming back here anymore.<br> - Sugar, you're serious?<br> - Of course.<br> Do you think I would stand here<br> and swear that swear and tell a story?<br> Sometimes, Bernice,<br> I think it takes you longer to realize<br> a fact than it does anybody who ever lived.<br> But you say you don't know<br> where you're going.<br> You're going, but you don't know where.<br> And that don't make sense to me.<br> Well, I feel just exactly<br> like somebody's peeled all the skin off me.<br> I wish I had some good<br> cold peach ice cream.<br> But every word I told you<br> was the solemn truth.<br> I'm leaving here after the wedding.<br> Oh, hello, T.T. And Honey.<br> I didn't hear you coming.<br> Hello.<br> What's the matter?<br> Your foster-brother, Honey,<br> got into a ruckus again.<br> Standing on the sidewalk<br> in front of Sam's Caf,<br> and the police cracked him on the head.<br> What?<br> Why, it's a welt the size of a small egg!<br> Times like this I feel like<br> I've got to bust loose or die.<br> What was you doing?<br> Nothing.<br> I was just passing down the street<br> and minding my own business,<br> when this drunk soldier came out of Sam's<br> and bumped into me.<br> I looked at him and he gave me a push.<br> I pushed him back and he started a ruckus.<br> Then this M.P. Came up<br> and slammed me with his stick.<br> It was just one of those accidents.<br> Could have happened to anybody.<br> Toot some of your horn, Honey.<br> Now, don't bother my horn, Butch.<br> Told you not to touch my horn!<br> Look at it!<br> You got it full of slobber inside and out.<br> - It's ruined!<br> - Now don't touch that little boy,<br> or I'll stomp your brains out!<br> John Henry knows when he needs<br> a good shake. Don't you, Butch?<br> Now, you run on home, candy.<br> It's way past your supper time.<br> John Henry, which hand is the money in?<br> You can keep it if you can guess right.<br> I won. Much obliged.<br> That sure is a cute suit you got on, Honey.<br> Yesterday I heard somebody speak<br> about you as Lightfoot Brown.<br> I think that's a grand nickname.<br> It's on account of your going to Harlem,<br> and all the different places<br> where you've run away. Lightfoot.<br> I wish somebody<br> would call me Lightfoot Addams.<br> Suit me better if Honey Camden<br> had brick feet.<br> Keeps me anxious and keeps me worried.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Now, Frankie, I want you to forget all that<br> foolishness we were discussing. You hear?<br> Now, if your papa ain't home by good dark,<br> go over to your Aunt Pat's<br> and play with John Henry.<br> Since when have I been scared of the dark?<br> You'll find your supper on top of the stove<br> and pie in the icebox.<br> Good night, sugar.<br> John Henry!<br> John Henry!<br> John Henry!<br> Yes, Frankie?<br> You asleep?<br> No. What do you want, Frankie?<br> Come on over and spend the night with me.<br> I can't.<br> Why?<br> Just because.<br> Because why? We could have a good time.<br> Frankie, I don't want to.<br> Oh, you fool jackass! Suit yourself!<br> Only asked you because you looked<br> so ugly and so lonesome!<br> Why, I'm not a bit lonesome.<br> Well, I don't want to go into that empty,<br> ugly house all by myself.<br> I'm mad at you.<br> I think something's wrong. It's too quiet.<br> I've a peculiar, supernatural warning<br> in my bones.<br> I'll bet you $100 it's going to storm.<br> I don't want to spend the night with you.<br> A terrible, terrible dog-day storm.<br> Or maybe even a cyclone,<br> or a tornado, or a tidal wave!<br> Frankie, if you're afraid,<br> I'll get my weekend bag and come over.<br> - Suit yourself.<br> - Then I'll stay here.<br> You don't need a weekend bag.<br> You're not going up to Savannah, just here.<br> Go tell your mama.<br> She's at the show.<br> Well, she'll know where you are. Come on.<br> Now I lay me down to sleep.<br> If I should die before I wake,<br> I pray the Lord my soul to take.<br> God bless Bernice, Mama, Uncle Royal,<br> Honey, T.T., the Americans and Frankie.<br> Frankie, when Bernice said...<br> That sounds like Honey.<br> He stopped to bang the spit out of his horn.<br> Please, Honey, go on, finish.<br> I bet a policeman stopped him.<br> To me it is the irony of fate,<br> the way they come here.<br> Those moths could fly anywhere,<br> yet they keep hanging around<br> the windows of this house.<br> I told Bernice I was leaving town for good.<br> She did not believe me.<br> Sometimes I honestly think<br> she's the biggest fool that ever drew breath.<br> You try to impress something<br> on a big fool like that,<br> and it's just like talking<br> to a block of cement.<br> I kept on telling and telling and telling her.<br> I told her I had to leave this town for good,<br> 'cause it is inevitable.<br> Inevitable!<br> What's "inevitable"?<br> Don't bother me, John Henry. I'm thinking.<br> What you thinking about?<br> About the wedding.<br> About my brother and the bride.<br> Everything's been so sudden today.<br> I never believed before<br> about the fact that the Earth turns<br> at about the rate of 1,000 miles a day.<br> But now it seems to me,<br> I feel the world going around very fast.<br> I feel it turning, and it makes me dizzy.<br> Turn the other way.<br> I'm going with them!<br> - What?<br> - I tell you, I'm going with them!<br> It's like I've known it all my life.<br> - Tomorrow I will tell everybody.<br> - Huh?<br> After the wedding,<br> I'm going with them to Winter Hill.<br> You serious?<br> The trouble with me<br> is that for a long time<br> I have been just an "I" person.<br> All people belong to a "we," except me.<br> When Bernice says "we," she means<br> her church, and lodge, and colored people.<br> Soldiers can say "we" and mean the army.<br> Until this afternoon, I didn't have a "we. "<br> But now, after seeing Janice and Jarvis,<br> I suddenly realize<br> that the bride and my brother<br> are the "we" of me.<br> So, I'm going with them.<br> I'm going with them<br> and joining with the wedding.<br> This coming Sunday,<br> when my brother and the bride leave town,<br> I'm going with them to Winter Hill,<br> and after that, to whatever place<br> that they will ever go.<br> I love the two of them so much,<br> and we belong to be together.<br> I love the two of them so much,<br> because they are the "we" of me.<br> You're going into tar, if you ain't careful.<br> I'm leaving town tomorrow.<br> After the wedding, I'm going with<br> my brother, Jarvis and Janice to Winter Hill.<br> And after that, for the rest of our lives<br> over the whole wide world.<br> That's a solemn fact.<br> I'll probably never see this old street again<br> for the rest of my whole life.<br> - Goodbye!<br> - Take care.<br> Good morning, Papa.<br> Good morning.<br> Papa, there's something I have to tell you.<br> After the wedding, I'm going away.<br> Papa?<br> How many times do I have to tell you<br> not to touch things.<br> If you break that, it will cost me $5.<br> Papa, please, listen to me.<br> All right, I'm listening. What is it?<br> I'm trying to tell you<br> that after the wedding, I'm...<br> Frankie, you take that lipstick off.<br> Now, what was it you wanted?<br> - I have to buy a wedding dress.<br> - All right, you charge it at O'Rourke's.<br> And wedding shoes<br> and a pair of sheer stockings.<br> You get what you need.<br> I'll call up and tell them it's all right.<br> Now, you get something nice.<br> I'll write to you, Papa.<br> I'll write you every day.<br> Pretty good, huh?<br> Yes. You on that stuff again?<br> Of course not.<br> Stop lying, Satan.<br> That much wind ain't natural.<br> That's gin blowing.<br> What's gin, Bernice?<br> Now, you go inside, candy,<br> and if you get caught high like that,<br> you're going to be in trouble for sure.<br> The parole man says so,<br> and remember, I've warned you.<br> Honey,<br> I need some help down at my store.<br> My porter's failed me again.<br> I wonder if you could help me.<br> I ain't got the time.<br> He's got a job.<br> He plays nights at Sam's Caf, Mr. Addams.<br> Keep Frankie home.<br> I won't be back for supper<br> I don't want her running wild in the streets.<br> All right, Mr. Addams.<br> Liar! And you got me lying, too.<br> You're in Sam's all night, playing,<br> but you're playing for nothing.<br> And when you ain't playing,<br> you're drumming up liquor parties.<br> But I feel good when I play.<br> Bernice, I got to have a dollar.<br> You're barking up the wrong tree, boy.<br> One of these days,<br> I'm getting me a good job.<br> Save my money, get out of this town.<br> You're just mean enough to do that.<br> Can't get a job to earn your rent money,<br> but you can to go away<br> and leave me alone to worry.<br> Bernice,<br> I got to have a dollar.<br> Here. At least it'll stop you from stealing.<br> Well, guess I'll be dancing off now.<br> Go away, boy. You ain't fooling nobody.<br> Don't worry. One buck ain't gonna get me<br> no ticket to Chicago.<br> Frankie, I'll thank you to do one thing<br> or the other, eat or comb.<br> I'm about to show you something.<br> - What? Frankie, what?<br> - You'll see.<br> Now, don't come in here, mind.<br> And don't peek!<br> Now, close your eyes,<br> and don't open them until I tell you.<br> These are the wedding clothes.<br> Oh, how pretty!<br> Well, what's the matter, Bernice?<br> Don't you like it?<br> No. It don't do.<br> What do you mean, it don't do?<br> Exactly that. It just don't do.<br> But I don't see what you mean.<br> What is wrong?<br> Well, if you can't see what is wrong,<br> I can't explain it to you.<br> Look at your head to begin with. Done had<br> all your hair shaved off like a convict.<br> You tie this ribbon around this head<br> with no hair, it looks peculiar.<br> But I'm going to wash<br> and try to stretch my hair tonight.<br> Stretch your hair?<br> How you going to stretch your hair?<br> And look at them elbows. Done bought<br> a grown woman's evening dress.<br> All that brown crust on your elbows.<br> The two things don't mix.<br> Take it back. Take it back to the store.<br> But I can't take it back,<br> it's bargain basement.<br> Well, let me see what I can do with it.<br> I think you're just not accustomed<br> to seeing anybody dressed up.<br> I ain't accustomed to seeing<br> human Christmas trees in August.<br> Frankie's dress looks like a Christmas tree!<br> Two-faced Judas! You just now said<br> it was pretty. Old double-faced Judas!<br> Step... Step back a little.<br> Now, don't you honestly think it's pretty?<br> Give me your candy opinion.<br> Frankie, I never knew anybody<br> so unreasonable.<br> You ask me my candy opinion.<br> I give you my candy opinion.<br> You ask me again, I give it again.<br> But what you want<br> is not my honest opinion,<br> but my good opinion on something<br> I know is wrong.<br> Do you think they'd think it looked funny?<br> Yes, sugar, I honestly do.<br> I only want to look pretty<br> for Janice and Jarvis.<br> Frankie, you still got your mind set<br> on going with them,<br> when you know in your soul<br> this mania of yours is pure foolishness.<br> I don't wish to have to remind you anymore.<br> Please call me F. Jasmine.<br> Furthermore, I want to emphasize<br> that everything good of mine<br> has got to be washed and ironed<br> so I can pack them in the suitcase.<br> Everybody in town believes that I'm leaving.<br> All except Papa.<br> He's stubborn as an old mule.<br> No use arguing with people like that.<br> Me and Mr. Addams has got some sense.<br> I told Papa this morning I was going,<br> but he wouldn't listen to me.<br> He never listens to what I say.<br> Sometimes I wonder if Papa loves me or not.<br> Of course he loves you. He's just<br> a busy widowed man set in his ways.<br> I wonder if I can find some tissue paper<br> to line this suitcase.<br> - Look at me!<br> - Take that off!<br> - You gave it to me. You said...<br> - Take it off!<br> You just put it on to make a show of me!<br> Truly, Frankie, what makes you think<br> they want you tagging along with them?<br> Two is company, three's a crowd.<br> - That's the main thing about a wedding.<br> - You wait and see.<br> Remember back to the time of the flood.<br> Remember Noah and the ark?<br> And what has that got to do with it?<br> Remember the way<br> he admitted them creatures?<br> Shut up, you big old mouth!<br> Two by two he admitted them creatures.<br> Two by two.<br> That's all right.<br> But you wait and see, they will take me.<br> And if they don't?<br> And if they don't,<br> I will kill myself.<br> Kill yourself? How?<br> I will shoot myself in the side of the head<br> with the pistol that Papa keeps<br> under his handkerchiefs<br> with Mother's picture in the bureau drawer.<br> You know what Mr. Addams said about you<br> playing around with that pistol.<br> I've heard of a many<br> a peculiar thing in my day,<br> but this idea of yours is the most peculiar.<br> I've known men to have fallen in love<br> with girls so ugly,<br> you'd wonder if their eyes are straight.<br> Even known boys to have fallen in love<br> with women older than their mothers.<br> Take Honey. He's in love with that horn.<br> I've known people to have fallen in love<br> with their selves.<br> Dear Lord, we thank thee for what we're<br> about to receive to nourish our body.<br> Amen.<br> And what was we talking about<br> in the first place?<br> - About peculiar things.<br> - Yes. As I was just now saying,<br> I've seen and heard of many a peculiar thing<br> in my day,<br> but one thing I ain't never seen<br> or heard tell of, no, sir,<br> never in all my boring days<br> have I ever heard<br> of anybody falling in love with a wedding.<br> And you have to think...<br> You know, I've come to a conclusion.<br> What you ought to be thinking about,<br> young lady, is a beau. Nice little beau.<br> I don't want any beau.<br> What would I do with one?<br> Do you mean something like a soldier who<br> would maybe take me to the Blue Moon?<br> Who said anything about soldiers?<br> I'm talking about a nice little white boy beau<br> your own age.<br> How about that little old Barney next door?<br> Barney McKean. That nasty Barney?<br> Certainly. You can make out with him<br> till someone better comes along. You do.<br> You are the biggest crazy in this town.<br> Crazy calls the sane the crazy.<br> Him and that girl down the block.<br> They go to the alley<br> behind that Pat's garage.<br> I think maybe they smoke or something.<br> They don't let anybody watch them.<br> I watched them once.<br> What do they do?<br> They don't smoke.<br> The piano tuning man.<br> I seriously believe this will be the last straw.<br> Me, too.<br> If it isn't Mary Littlejohn practicing, it's this.<br> They tell me that when they want to punish<br> the crazy people in Houghtonville,<br> they tie them up and make them listen<br> to piano tuning.<br> We could turn on the radio, drown him out.<br> I don't want the radio on.<br> But I advise you to keep the radio on<br> after I leave.<br> You may very likely hear us<br> speak over the radio.<br> Speak about what, pray tell?<br> Oh, I don't know what about exactly,<br> but probably some eyewitness account<br> about something we'll be asked to speak.<br> Don't follow you. What are you going<br> to eyewitness? Who could ask us to speak?<br> What, Frankie?<br> Who's speaking on the radio?<br> When I said, "We," you thought I meant<br> you and me and John Henry West,<br> to speak over the world radio.<br> I've never heard about anything so funny<br> since I was born.<br> Who? Why?<br> The club of girls.<br> What do you crooks mean<br> crossing my yard?<br> How many times do I have to tell you<br> not to set foot on my papa's property?<br> Get out of here!<br> You just ignore them.<br> Make out like you don't see them pass.<br> I hope they die.<br> Oh, Frankie, you mustn't say things<br> like that. We all die soon enough.<br> You going to die, Bernice?<br> Certainly, precious, everybody's got to die.<br> Everybody? Are you going to die, Frankie?<br> I doubt it.<br> I honestly don't think I'll ever die.<br> What is "die"?<br> It must be terrible to be dead.<br> Nothing but black, black, black.<br> Yes, baby.<br> Yes, baby.<br> How many dead people do you know?<br> I know six dead people in all,<br> not counting my mother.<br> Ludie Maxwell Freeman is dead.<br> I didn't count Ludie, it wouldn't be fair,<br> because he died just before I was born.<br> Bernice, do you think very frequently<br> about Ludie?<br> You know I do.<br> I think of the five wonderful years<br> we had together.<br> All the bad times I've seen since.<br> Sometimes I almost wish<br> I had never knew Ludie at all.<br> It makes you too lonesome afterwards.<br> You go home from work at night,<br> a terrible lonesome quinch comes over you.<br> Take up with too many sorry men<br> to try and get over the feeling.<br> But T.T. Is not sorry.<br> Oh, I wasn't referring to T.T.<br> He is a fine upstanding, colored gentleman,<br> that's walked in the state<br> of grace all his life.<br> But are you going to marry with him?<br> I'm not going to marry with him.<br> But you are just now saying...<br> I was just now saying<br> how sincerely I respect T.T.,<br> and how sincerely I regard T.T.<br> But he don't make me shiver none.<br> Listen, Bernice.<br> There's something queer I have to tell you.<br> It's... It's something that happened to me<br> when I was riding around town today.<br> Now, I don't exactly know<br> how to explain what I mean.<br> Then what is it?<br> Well, I was riding along<br> and I passed two stores with an alley<br> in between. The sun was frying hot.<br> And just as I passed this alley,<br> I caught a glimpse of something<br> out of the corner of my left eye.<br> A dark double shape.<br> And this glimpse brought to my mind,<br> so sudden and clear,<br> my brother and the bride, that I just stopped<br> and couldn't hardly bear<br> to look and see what it was.<br> And then I turned slowly and look.<br> And you know what was there?<br> It was just two boys. That was all.<br> But it gave me such a queer feeling.<br> This is the most remarkable thing<br> I ever heard of.<br> - What I mean is...<br> - I know. I know what you mean.<br> You mean right here<br> in the corner of your eyes,<br> you suddenly catch something.<br> A shiver runs through you.<br> You whirl around,<br> stand there facing you don't know what.<br> But not Ludie, not who you want.<br> And for a minute, you feel like<br> you've been dropped down a well.<br> Yes, that's it.<br> It's mighty remarkable.<br> It's a thing been happening to me all my life.<br> Yet, just now is the first time<br> I ever heard it put into words.<br> Yes, that's the way it is when you're in love.<br> I always maintained I never believed in love.<br> I never believed in love.<br> I have something to tell you,<br> and it's to be a warning.<br> You hear me, Frankie?<br> You hear me, John Henry?<br> Yes. I hear you, Bernice.<br> I'm here to tell you I was happy.<br> No human woman in all the world<br> was happier than I was in them days.<br> And that includes everybody.<br> The five years you were married to Ludie.<br> From that autumn morning<br> when I first met him<br> on the road in front<br> of Campbell's Filling Station,<br> up until the very night he died,<br> November, the year 1940.<br> The very year and the very month<br> I was born.<br> It was Thursday.<br> Thursday, long towards 6:00.<br> Around this time of day, only November.<br> I remember I went to the passage<br> and opened the front door.<br> Dark was coming on.<br> An old hound was howling far away.<br> And I go back in the room<br> and lay down on Ludie's bed.<br> And I lay myself over Ludie<br> with my arms spread out<br> and my face on his face.<br> And I prayed and asked the Lord<br> to contage my strength, my strength to him.<br> I even asked the Lord to let it be anybody,<br> but please don't let it be Ludie.<br> I laid there, I prayed.<br> Oh, how I've prayed.<br> Prayed for a long time,<br> until night.<br> Yet, that night he died.<br> I tell you he died.<br> Ludie.<br> Ludie Freeman.<br> Ludie Maxwell Freeman died.<br> It seems to me, I feel sadder<br> about Ludie than any other dead person,<br> although I never knew him.<br> I know I ought to cry sometimes<br> about my mother,<br> but it looks like I can't.<br> But Ludie...<br> Maybe it was because I was born<br> so soon after Ludie died.<br> But you were starting out to tell<br> some kind of a warning.<br> Don't you see what I was doing?<br> I loved Ludie.<br> He was the first man I ever loved.<br> Therefore, I had to go<br> and copy myself forever after.<br> And what I did was to marry off<br> just little pieces of Ludie<br> wherever I run across them.<br> And it was my misfortune<br> they all turned out to be the wrong pieces.<br> But my intentions<br> was to repeat me and Ludie.<br> Now don't you see?<br> I see what you're driving at. But I don't see<br> how it is a warning applied to me.<br> You don't?<br> Then I'll tell you.<br> You and that wedding tomorrow,<br> that's what I'm warning you about.<br> I see what you have in mind,<br> don't think I don't.<br> You think you're going to march up<br> to the preacher,<br> right in between your brother and the bride.<br> You think you're going<br> to break into that wedding,<br> and heavens only knows what else.<br> No.<br> I don't see myself walking<br> to the preacher with them.<br> I see through them eyes,<br> don't argue with me.<br> And what I'm warning you is this.<br> If you fall in love<br> with some unheard of thing like this,<br> what is ever going to happen to you?<br> Will you be trying to break into weddings<br> the rest of your days?<br> It makes me sick to listen to people<br> who don't have any sense!<br> You just like to talk about Ludie, that's all,<br> it's got nothing to do with me!<br> You're setting yourself this fancy trap<br> to catch yourself in trouble,<br> and you know it.<br> They will take me, you wait and see!<br> I'm only trying to reason seriously,<br> but I see it's no use.<br> You're just jealous!<br> You're just trying to deprive me<br> of all the pleasure of leaving town.<br> Do, Re, Me, Fa, So, La, Ti, Ti, Ti!<br> It could drive you wild!<br> Well, you didn't say anything<br> about Willis Rhodes. Why'd you marry him?<br> He have a mashed thumb,<br> or a code or something?<br> Now that... That really was something.<br> I only know he stole your furniture.<br> He was so terrible, you had to call the law.<br> That ain't all.<br> He was always running off somewhere.<br> So, imagine a cold, bitter January night,<br> if you can.<br> Me laying by myself on a big old pile of bed<br> and no one in the house,<br> 'cause everybody had gone out<br> for the Saturday night.<br> Me, mind you, hates to sleep<br> in a big old empty bed by myself at anytime.<br> Well, come past 12:00 on this cold,<br> bitter January night...<br> Can you remember winter time, John Henry?<br> Well, imagine,<br> suddenly there come a sloughing sound,<br> and a tap, tap, tap, on the window,<br> and Miss me...<br> I...<br> So what? What happened?<br> The way you look. Will you look at yonder.<br> Just look at my two pigeons<br> and their four big ears.<br> What happened?<br> Come on, sugar. Let's roll out the dough<br> for the wind cookies.<br> If it's anything I mortally despise,<br> it's a person who starts off to tell something<br> and works up people's interest<br> and then stops!<br> I admit it.<br> I'm sorry, but it was one of them things<br> I suddenly realized<br> I couldn't tell you and John Henry.<br> You could've sent him<br> out of the room and told me.<br> Oh, no, precious,<br> Bernice couldn't do that either.<br> Don't think I care a particle<br> about what happened.<br> I just wish Willis Rhodes had come in<br> about that time and slit your throat.<br> I wish you'd stop talking so rude.<br> Now, here, candy. Here's a scrap of dough<br> for you to make your cookie then.<br> Cookies. Cookies. Cookies!<br> I intend to take two baths tonight.<br> One long soaking bath and scrub<br> with the brush.<br> I'm gonna try and scrape this crust<br> off my elbows,<br> then let out the dirty water,<br> take a second bath.<br> Great. Good idea.<br> I'd be glad to see you clean for a change.<br> I will take two baths.<br> Why is it against the law<br> to change your name?<br> What's that on your neck?<br> Thought that was a head you carried<br> on that neck. Just think.<br> Suppose I ups and calls myself<br> Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt.<br> John Henry here tries to palm himself off<br> as Henry Ford.<br> Don't talk childish.<br> That's not the kind of changing I mean.<br> I mean from a name that doesn't suit you<br> to a name you prefer.<br> Like I'd change from Frankie to F. Jasmine.<br> But it would still be confusion.<br> Suppose we all decided to change<br> to entirely different names.<br> Nobody would know<br> who anybody was talking about.<br> The whole world would go crazy.<br> I don't see what that has to do with it.<br> Because things accumulate around a name.<br> You have a name,<br> one thing after another happens to you,<br> things have accumulated around your name.<br> But what has accumulated<br> around my old name?<br> Nothing, see?<br> My name just didn't mean anything.<br> Until yesterday,<br> nothing ever happened to me.<br> But it will. Things will happen.<br> What?<br> Halt.<br> Take off my shoes,<br> my hat, my pocketbook,<br> and I thank you very much.<br> Listen, Bernice.<br> Doesn't it strike you as strange<br> that I am I, and you are you?<br> Like when you walk down the street<br> and you meet somebody,<br> and you are you, and he is him.<br> Yet, when you look at each other,<br> the eyes make a connection.<br> Then you go off one way<br> and he goes off another way.<br> And maybe you never see each other again,<br> not in your whole life.<br> Do you see what I mean?<br> Not exactly.<br> That's not what I meant to say anyway.<br> I'm talking about this town.<br> There are all those people here in town<br> that I don't even know by sight or name.<br> And now I'm leaving town and there are<br> all those people I will never know.<br> - Well, who is it you want to know?<br> - Everybody.<br> - Everybody in the world.<br> - Well, just listen to that.<br> It would take you over 200,000 years<br> to know everybody.<br> That's not what I mean.<br> That's not what I'm talking about!<br> Then what do you mean,<br> and what are you talking about?<br> - Let's play out, Frankie.<br> - No, you go!<br> - This is what I mean.<br> - What on earth is wrong with you?<br> Man, oh, boy! Boy, oh, man!<br> When we leave Winter Hill,<br> we're going to more places than you ever<br> thought about or even knew existed.<br> Just where we'll go first,<br> I don't know, and it don't matter,<br> because after we go to that place,<br> we're going on to another.<br> Alaska, China, Iceland, South America.<br> Traveling on trains,<br> riding a rip on motorcycles,<br> flying all over the world in airplanes!<br> Here today and gone tomorrow,<br> all over the world!<br> - It's the whole truth. Boy, oh, man!<br> - Now, Frank...<br> And talking of things happening,<br> things will happen so fast,<br> we won't hardly have time to realize them.<br> Captain Jarvis Addams wins highest medals<br> and is decorated by the President.<br> Miss F. Jasmine Addams breaks all records.<br> Mrs. Janice Addams elected<br> Miss United Nations in beauty contest.<br> One thing after another,<br> happening so fast, we'd hardly realize it.<br> - Hold still...<br> - And we'll meet them. Everybody.<br> We'll just walk up to people<br> and know them right away.<br> We'll be walking down a dark road<br> and see a lighted house<br> and knock on the door,<br> and strangers will rush to meet us<br> and say, "Come in! Come in!"<br> We will know decorated aviators,<br> and New York people, and movie stars.<br> And we'll have thousands<br> and thousands of friends.<br> We'll belong to so many clubs<br> that we can't even keep track of them all.<br> We will be members<br> of the whole world. Boy, oh, man!<br> - Man, oh, boy!<br> - Hush, child, child.<br> Come, child. Come to Bernice.<br> Bernice knows. Bernice understands.<br> And now, Bernice wants you to sit<br> on her lap so she can quiet you down.<br> You know you're trying<br> to grow up too fast, Frankie.<br> Leave Frankie alone.<br> She ain't bothering you.<br> - I'm sick.<br> - Oh, no, you're not.<br> And don't you grudge your cousin<br> a little bit of love.<br> - Old mean bossy Frankie.<br> - What is she doing so mean right now?<br> Just laying here, all wore out,<br> trying to get some rest.<br> If I have to be me for the rest of my life,<br> I think I'll go crazy.<br> Sometimes I feel like<br> I just can't breathe anymore.<br> I feel like I just wish<br> I could tear down the whole town.<br> So, I've heard you mention,<br> but that don't help none.<br> We go around trying first one thing<br> and then another.<br> Yet, we're still caught, just the same.<br> That's the way I see it in my mind's eye.<br> Bernice, which eye is your mind's eye?<br> Don't yank my head back like that, candy.<br> Me and Frankie ain't going to float<br> through the ceiling and leave you.<br> I wonder if you've ever thought about this?<br> Here we are, right now,<br> this very minute, now.<br> While we're talking right now,<br> this minute is passing,<br> and it will never come again,<br> never in the whole world.<br> When it's gone, it is gone,<br> no power on earth could bring it back again.<br> I sing because I'm happy<br> I sing because I'm free<br> For His eye is on the sparrow<br> I know He watches me<br> Why should I feel discouraged<br> Why should the shadows come<br> Why should my heart be lonely<br> Away from heaven and home<br> For Jesus is my portion<br> My constant friend is He<br> For His eye is on the sparrow<br> And I know He watches me<br> His eye is on the sparrow<br> And I know<br> that He watches me<br> So I sing<br> because I'm happy<br> - Oh, I sing<br> - Oh, I sing<br> - because I'm free<br> - because I'm free<br> - For His eye<br> - For His eye<br> - is on the sparrow<br> - is on the sparrow<br> - And I know<br> - And I know<br> - He watches me<br> - He watches me<br> Frankie, you got<br> the sharpest set of human bones I ever felt.<br> Dearly beloved,<br> we are gathered together here,<br> in the sight of God,<br> and in the presence of these witnesses,<br> to join together this man and this woman<br> in holy matrimony.<br> Do you, Jarvis,<br> take Janice to be your wedded wife,<br> to have and to hold from this day forward,<br> for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer,<br> in sickness and in health, to love<br> and to cherish till death do you part?<br> I do.<br> And do you, Janice,<br> take Jarvis to be your wedded husband,<br> to have and to hold from this day forward,<br> for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer,<br> in sickness and in health,<br> to love and to cherish<br> till death do you part?<br> I do.<br> The ring.<br> Repeat after me, Jarvis.<br> With this ring, I thee wed.<br> With this ring, I thee wed.<br> - Give me that.<br> - Let go! Let go!<br> Frankie! Frankie!<br> A toast! A toast to the bride and groom!<br> Congratulations!<br> - Frankie?<br> - Frankie?<br> - I'm going with you.<br> - With us?<br> - But, Frankie, you can't.<br> - I love you.<br> We have to be together.<br> Wherever you go, I'm going, too.<br> - Frankie, this is our honeymoon.<br> - What is it?<br> - Frankie, get out of there.<br> - No, no, no!<br> - Janice and Jarvis are taking me with them.<br> - This is the absolute limit.<br> - Frankie, get out of there or I'll pull you out.<br> - No, don't touch me!<br> Dad, let me talk to her, please.<br> Frankie, your brother and I are married now,<br> and we only have three days together<br> before he has to go back to camp.<br> You don't want to spoil it for us, do you?<br> I know you love us and we love you, but...<br> We. We. When you say "we,"<br> you only mean you and Jarvis,<br> and I'm not included.<br> Frankie, you're spoiling our wedding.<br> No, I'm not! I'm not! Take me! Take me!<br> All right, you'll have to be shown then!<br> Will you get out of here!<br> I've had enough of this nonsense.<br> Take me! Take me!<br> Come on, baby.<br> Come on, baby, in the house.<br> They put old Frankie out of the wedding.<br> They hauled her out of the wedding car.<br> That's sufficient, John Henry.<br> You leave Frankie alone.<br> My heart feels so cheap.<br> Now, what makes<br> you want to leave your old papa like this?<br> I love them so.<br> Frankie, don't cry.<br> Now, please be reasonable, Frankie.<br> I just wish the whole world would die.<br> Listen.<br> Tell me what you'd like,<br> and I'll try to do it if it's in my power.<br> All I wish in the world<br> is for no human being to speak to me again<br> as long as I live.<br> Well, bawl then, misery.<br> Well, it looks like the show is over<br> and the monkey's dead.<br> - You think it's over, but it's not.<br> - Now, now, now, now, now.<br> You want to come down<br> and help me in the store tomorrow?<br> Polish some silver with the chamois rag?<br> You can even play<br> with those old watch springs.<br> If you think it's all over,<br> that only shows how little you know.<br> They all complimented the wine punch.<br> - You got a touch with liquor, T.T.<br> - I do for a fact.<br> Well, I reckon it's because<br> I keep the liquor on the outside of me<br> instead of on the in, most of the time.<br> Who's that?<br> - Bernice.<br> - What are you doing out there?<br> - Douse the light.<br> - What are you doing out there?<br> - What are you afraid of?<br> - Turn off the light.<br> - Are you drunk?<br> - I'm scared out of being drunk.<br> - You in trouble.<br> - The law's after me.<br> Honey, what have you done now?<br> Well, I borrowed this car, and...<br> John Henry, what are doing here like that?<br> You want to catch your death?<br> - I feel funny, Bernice.<br> - No, you don't.<br> Now, go home to bed before<br> your mama comes back and finds you here.<br> - I'm sick, Bernice.<br> - No, you're not. You just want attention.<br> Now, run on home, candy.<br> I don't have the patience<br> to fool with you tonight.<br> - What happened?<br> - Well, I borrowed this car.<br> - The car hit a man hard, like, to kill him.<br> - And you run away?<br> You fool, Honey Brown, you fool.<br> - Was it a white man?<br> - I think so.<br> Bernice, you got to help me.<br> They put me on the road again<br> for this for sure.<br> - Lf I'm lucky, they put me on the road.<br> - Don't talk like that.<br> T.T., I have to ask you to do this for me.<br> Here's all the money I got.<br> You want me<br> to take him out of town in my car?<br> Please.<br> Bernice, I...<br> Honey. Honey.<br> You will be careful.<br> You be careful, both of you.<br> Lord, you took Ludie,<br> won't you please<br> watch over Honey Camden?<br> He's all the family I've got left.<br> - You heard me, pick that up!<br> - Pick it up yourself.<br> You clean that up.<br> I'm not your slave to walk around<br> after you and clean up your dirt.<br> You pig, you. Get out!<br> Get out of here! Go someplace and die!<br> Hey, there.<br> I saw you through the window.<br> Hello.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I don't know, Savannah, I guess.<br> I have to go back to camp tomorrow.<br> Boy, I sure will be glad<br> to get out of this old town.<br> Three days I've been here, three days,<br> and nobody has even said hello to me.<br> All they want to say<br> is how much something costs.<br> What's the matter?<br> Well, what's the matter?<br> I think they're after me.<br> My father might have sent them.<br> You see, I've decided to leave home.<br> There's a back room.<br> We can go in there.<br> Come on. Bring the beer.<br> Well, let's sit down.<br> - Drink up.<br> - No, I don't think I want anymore, thank you.<br> Well, don't be scared.<br> Let's go outside. They probably went away.<br> It's nicer in here.<br> Let go!<br> Papa.<br> Bernice? Bernice?<br> Bernice?<br> John Henry. John Henry!<br> John Henry's bad sick.<br> Don't make any noise.<br> I'll come up.<br> You stay there. The doctor doesn't know<br> what ails John Henry yet,<br> it might be catching.<br> But he'd like to see me.<br> He's too sick, Frankie. Now you go to bed.<br> How bad is he sick, Bernice?<br> He's... He's...<br> The whole house seems so hollow.<br> It gives me a creepy feeling<br> watching them take our things out.<br> Occasionally, when it gets so quiet like this,<br> I have a strange feeling.<br> It's like John Henry<br> is hovering in this kitchen,<br> solemn-looking and ghost-gray.<br> I don't see why he had to suffer so,<br> that poor little soul.<br> I never believed John Henry would die.<br> It's funny.<br> I felt so sad, and I missed him so much,<br> but lately I can hardly even picture him.<br> He's like a little white ghost<br> going further and further away.<br> And to think I said, "Run along, candy.<br> I don't have the patience to fool with you. "<br> - It's just judgment on me.<br> - I'm forgetting about him.<br> Sometimes I never think of him once,<br> all day long.<br> That's natural. You're growing up.<br> I'll thank you not to be banging<br> that old sewing machine around like that.<br> I've had 22 years service out of it,<br> and there's still plenty use in it yet.<br> Okay, okay.<br> Bernice, I wish<br> you didn't have to give quitting orders<br> just because we're all moving together.<br> But your papa won't be needing me<br> with your Aunt Pat keeping house.<br> - What's that?<br> - Rachmaninoff.<br> I'm just mad about Rachmaninoff.<br> Mary is just beginning this concerto.<br> She may play it for her debut<br> when she is 18 years old.<br> Mary playing the piano,<br> and a whole orchestra playing at one<br> and the same time, mind you.<br> - Awfully hard.<br> - Mary Littlejohn?<br> I don't know why you always have to speak<br> her name in a tinged voice like that.<br> Have I ever said anything against her?<br> All I said was she's too lumpy,<br> marshmallow white,<br> and she makes me nervous to see her<br> sitting there sucking on them pigtails.<br> Braids.<br> Furthermore, there's no use<br> our discussing a certain party.<br> You could never possibly understand,<br> it's just not in you.<br> Be that as it may,<br> let us not fuss or quarrel our last afternoon.<br> I don't want to fuss either.<br> Besides, it's not our last afternoon.<br> I'll come and see you often.<br> No, you won't, baby.<br> You'll have other things to do.<br> Your road is already strange to me now.<br> You still have the fox fur<br> that Ludie gave you.<br> Somehow this little fur<br> looks so sad, so thin,<br> with a sad little fox-wise face.<br> Got every reason to look sad with<br> what's happened these past few months.<br> And I just don't know...<br> I don't know what I've done to deserve it.<br> The way Honey looked<br> when the judge said 10 years.<br> John Henry, my little boy, gone.<br> It's peculiar the way it all happened so fast.<br> First Honey caught,<br> then later in that same week,<br> John Henry died,<br> and then I got to know Mary.<br> As the irony of fate would have it,<br> we first got to know each other<br> in front of the lipsticks<br> and cosmetics counter at Woolworth's.<br> And it was the week of the fair.<br> - Frankie. Hey, Frankie.<br> - Yes, Barney.<br> - Is Mary there?<br> - No.<br> It's Barney McKean.<br> I'm meeting her at our new house at 5:00.<br> - Come on in, Barney, won't you?<br> - Okay.<br> Barney puts me in mind of a Greek god.<br> - Barney puts you in mind of what?<br> - Of a Greek god.<br> Mary remarked<br> that Barney reminded her of a Greek god.<br> It looks like I can't understand<br> a thing you say no more.<br> You know, those old-timey Greeks<br> worshipped those Greek gods.<br> But what has that got to do<br> with Barney McKean?<br> On account of the figure.<br> Hi, Greek god Barney.<br> This afternoon I seen your initials<br> chalked down on the sidewalk.<br> "M.L. Loves B.M."<br> If I could find out who did it,<br> I'd rub it out with their faces.<br> - Did you do it, Frankie?<br> - I wouldn't do a kid thing like that.<br> I even resent you asking me.<br> Resent you asking me.<br> - Mary can't stand me anyhow.<br> - Yes, she can stand you.<br> I'm her most intimate friend,<br> I ought to know.<br> As a matter of fact, she's told me<br> several lovely compliments about you.<br> I'm riding on the moving van<br> to our new house.<br> Would you like to come along?<br> - Sure.<br> - Okay.<br> You can ride back with the furniture,<br> 'cause I'm riding on the front seat<br> with the driver.<br> We got a letter<br> from Janice and Jarvis this afternoon.<br> Jarvis is stationed<br> with the occupation forces in Germany,<br> and they took a vacation trip<br> to Luxembourg.<br> Luxembourg.<br> Don't you think<br> that's a lovely name, Bernice?<br> Kind of pretty name,<br> but it reminds me of soapy water.<br> Mary and I will most likely<br> pass through Luxembourg<br> when we are going<br> around the world together.<br> I'll see you soon, Bernice.<br> Sure, baby.<br>
