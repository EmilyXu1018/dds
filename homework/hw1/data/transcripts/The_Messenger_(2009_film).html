                        Here. Right here. just wait.<br> Sorry. I'm late. I-<br> I ain't dead yet.<br> It's also for healing.<br> And celebration, you know?.<br> Hey.<br> Yeah.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I'd like to sit at that table.<br> - Why?.<br> - I'd like to sit at that table.<br> - I know, but they're still eating. It's fine-<br> - I can see that.<br> I don't know, I think-<br> I think in, like, a year or so, you know,<br> I think I'll be ready...<br> but, you know, I really-<br> I want to get married.<br> I just- like, eventually, you know.<br> I don't-<br> I just don't want to right now.<br> Plus, we're kind of on this,<br> like, cruise control, you know?.<br> Which is normal. I mean, it happens to<br> every couple. It happened to us.<br> Where did you tell him you were going?.<br> - To visit you.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> To visit my dad.<br> - And he believed that?.<br> - I invited him actually, but...<br> it turns out he was really, really busy.<br> You always were a terrific liar.<br> That's not fair.<br> - I really do love him, you know?.<br> - Well, I do.<br> He's the right guy for you.<br> I mean, what do you want to do?.<br> Are you thinking... family?.<br> Bachelorhood?.<br> College?. job?.<br> You don't have to worry about me.<br> The world's my fucking oyster.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> I really wanted to see you.<br> I'm glad you came.<br> Say hi to Alan for me.<br> I don't think so.<br> Somewhere you gotta be?.<br> No, sir.<br> How long has he been waiting?.<br> Seventeen minutes, sir.<br> Send him in.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Come in.<br> Sir, Staff Sergeant Montgomery reports.<br> At ease. How you getting on, Montgomery?.<br> - It's going well, sir.<br> - I have an assignment for you, Montgomery.<br> It so happens that over the few months you<br> have left on your enlistment...<br> you will get your chance to render some of<br> your most valuable service to your country.<br> I'm assigning you to<br> a Casualty Notification team.<br> Sir?.<br> Captain Stone will show you the ropes.<br> He is the expert.<br> But until he does,<br> I just want to make myself very clear...<br> that although most of your time will<br> remain occupied by your other duties...<br> CNO is to be your absolute priority.<br> This mission is not simply important.<br> It is sacred.<br> - Sir, if l may?.<br> - Go ahead.<br> I've never received any grief counseling,<br> let alone given it.<br> I'm not a religious man, sir.<br> We're just there for notification.<br> Not God. Not heaven.<br> Montgomery...<br> this job is about character.<br> Now I have had soldiers go out on<br> notification and break into a stutter.<br> Men so nervous they read from a script<br> or get the name wrong...<br> or the address.<br> Too many tears.<br> I need men of solid stature.<br> Now you are a model soldier.<br> Hell, you're a goddamn hero.<br> Casualty is a soldier whos<br> been killed, wounded, missing...<br> captured, beleaguered or besieged.<br> Of course, our jobs mainly about killed.<br> What you actually need<br> to do is pretty simple-<br> read the guidebook, learn the script...<br> stick to the script, fill in the blanks<br> from the casualty report.<br> - Can you do that?.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Can you look at me when I speak with you?.<br> Much appreciated.<br> Never say stuff like lost<br> or expired or passed away...<br> things people misunderstand.<br> I knew this guy once told this old lady<br> that her grandson was no longer with us.<br> She thought he had defected to the enemy,<br> started calling him a traitor.<br> We need to be clear.<br> Need to say killed or died.<br> What we don't say<br> is the deceased or the body.<br> We call each casualty by name.<br> We honor them. You with me?.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Then look at me, Sergeant.<br> You do not speak with anybody<br> other than the next of kin.<br> No friend, no neighbor,<br> no coworker or mistress.<br> Hours of operation are 0600 to 2200 hours.<br> We don't want to wake anybody<br> up in the middle of the night...<br> though if you ask me, hitting them with<br> the news at the crack of dawn...<br> is not exactly a great way<br> to start their day, breakfast wise.<br> What do we do if<br> the next of kin isn't around?.<br> We leave. We don't wait. We don't lurk.<br> We come back later.<br> This is a zero-defect mission.<br> A pure hit-and-git operation.<br> Is that it, sir?.<br> One more thing.<br> You do not touch the NOK.<br> Avoid physical contact<br> with the next of kin...<br> unless it's a medical emergency, like if they<br> were having a heart attack or something.<br> You're representing the Secretary of the Army,<br> not Will Montgomery.<br> So in case you feel like offering a hug<br> or something, don't.<br> It'll only get you in trouble.<br> I'm not gonna be offering any hugs, sir.<br> - Is that's it?.<br> - No.<br> These are the rules. It's not the job.<br> The job is about...<br> something else.<br> You gotta do it before you can understand.<br> You a head case?.<br> No, sir.<br> I surely hope not.<br> Then that's it. You can go.<br> Sergeant, one more thing.<br> We make it our business to deliver<br> the news within 24 hours of positive I D.<br> The ideal is within four.<br> We're racing FOX,<br> CNN, Drudge Report, what-have-you.<br> Not to mention any soldier<br> with a cell phone or a webcam.<br> The whole point is we gotta be first.<br> So, if youre in bed...<br> or church or the ballet,<br> this baby stays on.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Tried and true.<br> A long battery life too. Can't be beat.<br> I know what youre thinking.<br> You're thinking-<br> ""Shit, I'm a goddamn decorated war hero...<br> with three months left to serve and they<br> draft me into the Angels of Death squadron.<br> I get a beeper, a canned speech...<br> and a lunatic commanding officer<br> to surf a fucking ocean of grief."<br> Am I right?.<br> More or less, sir. Am I right?.<br> It's the middle of the fucking night!<br> Turn that fucking music off!.<br> There's your problem.<br> Attention to detail, Private!<br> Read the fucking manual!<br> You have 1 30-degree heat.<br> You have sand blasting.<br> It's baked the hose<br> right under the housing.<br> Break the suction.<br> Every second you're<br> on the side of the road...<br> increases your chances of getting shot...<br> your boys shot, your boys blown up.<br> No haji armor's gonna protect you.<br> Plus you're fucking up<br> a five billion dollar a week operation...<br> because you don't have<br> a 25 cent cooling hose.<br> So you think ahead.<br> You have 1 0 in the back.<br> You think ahead. You prepare.<br> You think ahead.<br> Yeah, well, should be<br> in the next couple blocks.<br> We should just ask someone.<br> No.<br> First offal, men don't ask for directions,<br> much less soldiers.<br> Soldiers on a notification, definitely,<br> positively do not ask for freaking directions.<br> No GPS. No MapQest. We navigate.<br> Second, you never wanna park too close.<br> They hear a car park, go to the window,<br> see two soldiers getting out...<br> it's just a minute of torture.<br> Now I should warn you<br> some of them do have guns.<br> Knocking is ominous,<br> but ringing is jarring.<br> Or worse, sometimes you get one of those<br> god-awful chirping doorbells...<br> some singsongy shit throws<br> you right off your game.<br> Yankee Doodle went to town<br> A ridin' on a pony<br> And "Sorry your husband is dead"<br> doesn't flow. So I knock.<br> I don't really like to say good morning<br> or good afternoon either.<br> There ain't nothing good about it.<br> I used to introduce myself, that's standard,<br> but now I think it's rude.<br> It ain't about me. Lose the shades.<br> We're looking for Mrs. Tina Burrell.<br> Is she in?.<br> Is Leroy in trouble again?.<br> I'm his girlfriend.<br> We need to speak with Mrs. Burrell.<br> Okay, Come in. Come in.<br> Please, sit down.<br> I just made some tea.<br> Do you want some?.<br> Ma'am, could you please get Mrs. Burrell?.<br> Yeah, she's down the block. She just called.<br> She'll be back in a minute.<br> I thought you said we don't wait.<br> If shes not here in 30 seconds,<br> we're gone.<br> Sit.<br> I'm Monica. I'm Leroy's girlfriend.<br> And this is his baby. He's a boy.<br> But he don't know that yet, so don't tell<br> him because I ain't calling him junior.<br> Two cell phones.<br> One was $209.75, and the other-<br> What did he do?.<br> I'm sorry, ma'am. Our orders<br> are to speak with Mrs. Burrell.<br> Well, I am too. I mean, I was gonna be.<br> We were supposed to get married, but then<br> my father got laid off and-<br> Look, I know Leroy's always saying<br> the wrong thing, but he's a good man.<br> Please, just tell me.<br> I got an envelope<br> with these sheets of paper.<br> Could I see those papers, please?<br> We'll be back.<br> You sent her the money and this envelope<br> came with these two pictures-<br> Sir, tell me.<br> Oh, why?. Oh, no,<br> please, God, no! My, God, why?.<br> - What's going-<br> - I have bad news, Mrs. Burrell.<br> The Secretary of the Army has asked me to<br> express his deepest regret...<br> that your son,<br> Private First Class Leroy Burrell-<br> No, no, no!<br> You got to go! You got to go!<br> - I'm very sorry, Mrs. Burrell.<br> - No. Listen. No!<br> That's my baby. That's my baby.<br> We can't do this right-<br> - Your son was killed yesterday-<br> - Monica- Oh, my God! My house is a mess.<br> - A Casualty Assistance-<br> - No! Don't you say that about my baby!<br> Dont you say that about my baby!<br> - I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.<br> - No! Make him go!<br> A Casualty Assistance Officer<br> will contact you shortly...<br> - to help you arrange for the funeral.<br> - Tell him to stop saying that!<br> We left them with the next-door neighbor.<br> - How'd she take it?<br> - Hard. Very hard.<br> - Okay.<br> - Yep.<br> We'll be there by 1 000 hours.<br> All right, thanks. Good luck.<br> CAO is on the way.<br> No such thing as a satisfied customer.<br> Ice cream! Ice cream!<br> Ice cream! Ice cream!<br> Double whiskey, please.<br> - Hot water and lemon?.<br> - And a glass of ice.<br> I'm in AA, if youre asking.<br> Been sober three years. Mind you, I never<br> drank anything stronger than pop.<br> Of course, my pop would drink<br> just about anything.<br> Oh, they tell them to get ready<br> when their kids deploy...<br> but they never really listen, do they?.<br> Soldiers go to war<br> and everyone waves flags and applauds...<br> Look at charts, study strategies,<br> have ""informed opinions."<br> And then bullets fly and soldiers die<br> and it's such a shock.<br> Fuck that! What did they think<br> it was gonna be like, FearFactor?<br> - Where'd you see action?.<br> - Desert Storm/Desert Shield.<br> Never got a crack at Enduring Freedom<br> or Iraqi Freedom, much to my chagrin.<br> Wasn't much of a war, but...<br> I got my baptism too.<br> You weren't the only one getting shot at.<br> So they say you saved your buddies.<br> You want to know what I think?.<br> I think they ought to show<br> every goddamn funeral on TV, live.<br> Have the president come<br> around from time to time and eulogize...<br> the vice president, get people used to it.<br> I mean, are we at war or not?.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Sure thing.<br> - Let me know if you guys need anything else.<br> - Oh, you know it already, Emily.<br> I'd like to strap her on and wear her like<br> a government-issue gas mask.<br> - I got my sights on her, so don't even go there.<br> - Roger that.<br> I figure I could play<br> the sensitivity card.<br> Tell her what my day was like<br> down in death valley.<br> Then again, sympathy backfires...<br> she'll never leave.<br> Trust me, I've been married three times.<br> Twice to the same woman.<br> So now you know what the mission is.<br> Yeah.<br> Hey, if youre not cut out for it...<br> you're not cut out for it.<br> So you have a girl?.<br> You got to think about it?.<br> Kelly.<br> We were together<br> since we were little kids.<br> Then when I was deployed, everything-<br> She wanted you to commit, you balked...<br> and the minute you were gone,<br> jody plunked his ass down in the La-Z-Boy.<br> You probably dodged a bullet.<br> The only reason to get married like that<br> is the extra pay.<br> Cut them in, then cut them loose.<br> Of course, they can always get pregnant<br> and bleed you dry.<br> It's too easy.<br> I just told her she was free.<br> I didn't want you knocking on her door.<br> Yeah, well.<br> Anyway, lot of Shellys out there.<br> Kelly.<br> You know, up to Vietnam,<br> they used send a telegram.<br> If it was your wife, what would she want?.<br> Why don't you just kill me,<br> you son of a bitch!<br> Yeah! Come on! Come on!<br> Hey, that was quick.<br> Are you awake?.<br> just making sure you're on your toes.<br> - Is this a joke, sir?<br> - No, no. I just-<br> You know, since I stopped drinking,<br> I stay up nights...<br> especially after notifying someone.<br> So you think you might stay on<br> after your enlistment's up?<br> I mean...<br> hell, you-<br> What's your e-mail anyway?. Do you I M?.<br> I don't have a computer.<br> Really?. How does that work?.<br> Hey, you're funny.<br> - What?<br> - You calling my beeper.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - Oh, shit.<br> Get ready. I'll meet you on post.<br> What's going on?.<br> You gotta get out of here.<br> Don't look at me like that. I gotta go,<br> so you gotta go. Come on, let's go.<br> I don't get it.

To protect the next one.<br> Another soldier dies slipping into<br> a ditch, we call it a combat death...<br> just to give it a meaning.<br> What's your point?.<br> My point?.<br> My point is that sometimes the army...<br> has to be concerned<br> with something bigger than the truth.<br> And it's not that<br> they don't care about you.<br> On the contrary, there is not a family<br> on God's green Earth...<br> that takes better care of you<br> than the US Army.<br> Really?.<br> Really.<br> Civilian life's for people<br> who ain't seen shit.<br> It's too late for you.<br> You've already seen the shit.<br> You can't unsee it anymore.<br> You can't be an insurance salesman now,<br> brother.

I pick one of 'em up.<br> He was...<br> I don't know,<br> third month, fourth month, 1 8, 1 9.<br> Pull the other one with my free hand...<br> take us and drop them behind<br> these truck tires.<br> And we're all catching our breath,<br> trying to radio the bird...<br> when I see Derek...<br> just bleeding out in the middle<br> of the street.<br> Now, sniper fire had slowed...<br> and he was on his back.<br> He had his hands up like this.<br> Looked like he was- like he was praying.<br> Nothing but noise from the radio,<br> so I make a mad dash to him.<br> It's pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!<br> Grab his wrist, drag him across the street<br> behind this burned-out old car.<br> And he looking down at his hands.<br> He keeps looking down at his damn hands.<br> He keeps opening them and closing them...<br> and he's opening,<br> he keeps saying over and over...<br> ""I can't feel my hands.<br> I can't feel my hands"'<br> And I'm looking down at his hands.<br> His hands are fine.<br> There's not a spot on them...<br> when his left leg is, you know,<br> halfway down the block.<br> So I start pushing him<br> underneath the car...<br> and I'm saying, ""Derek, your hands<br> are fine. Your hands are fine.<br> just sit tight"'<br> And he looked at me like I was-<br> He looked at me like I was lying to him.<br> And that's when the I ED<br> went off under him.<br> Jesus.<br> I actually got pieces of him<br> blasted right into me.<br> It was like...<br> flesh shrapnel.<br> When I came to,<br> I had already been to the FOB.<br> I was on my way to Ramstein. In the hospital,<br> I'm laid out and some guy comes in.<br> I can't see very well,<br> and he drops this little-<br> drops a little ribbon<br> on my bare chest and I'm-<br> I'm all hooked up to wires and machines<br> and heart rate monitors...<br> IV's and shit.<br> Shit I, you know, shit I don't need.<br> And he-<br> he says, ""Son...<br> you're a hero"'<br> Damn right, you are.<br> No.<br> No, I- No.<br> I put him there.<br> I did that.<br> That was me.<br> I didn't mean to. I didn't plan that.<br> There's no planning. You can't plan.<br> You only have the moment,<br> but that's what I did.<br> I-<br> I loaded him into the bomb.<br> That's not a hero in my book.<br> A couple weeks later,<br> I'm on crutches.<br> Major surgery. Fox eye shield patch.<br> And everything looks gray-<br> the nurses, the flowers, blood.<br> I'm wandering the halls in the hospital.<br> My ears are ringing.<br> I take the elevator up to the roof<br> and climb the stairs.<br> And we're not supposed to be up there...<br> but that's where the doctors<br> take their smoke breaks.<br> So the door was open.<br> And the whole-<br> the whole living thing just didn't,<br> you know, make sense anymore.<br> It was-<br> I was out there for a while...<br> standing on the edge...<br> and it was cold and it was dark...<br> and I felt calm.<br> Why didnt you jump?.<br> The sun came up.<br> The sun came up?.<br> Yes.<br> The sun came up and-<br> and I didn't feel like dying anymore.<br> Want another one?.<br> No, I just-<br> Pepsi.<br> This fake beer tastes like laundry.<br> Pass me the ball. Pass me the ball.<br> Where you heading?.<br> Louisiana.<br> Taking the piano.<br> What?.<br> Why?.<br> - Do you play?.<br> - No.<br> A little bit.<br> My mom forced me when I was a kid.<br> I hated it.<br> Hey, you don't have to-<br> Thanks a lot.<br> - Yes!<br> - Good-bye, Will.<br> Good luck.<br> Look, I've never been very good at timing.<br> I wouldn't say that.<br> Maybe... you'd let me know where you are,<br> you know, your address?.<br> I don't mind driving.<br> I think I could handle that.<br> Okay?.<br> Okay.<br> E-mail?.<br> Yeah. I just have to get a computer first.<br> I could check at Tony's, though.<br> You're staying on?.<br> Thinking about it.<br> Why dont you come inside<br> and give me your address...<br> and I'll write you a letter.<br> I'd like that.<br> Yeah.<br>
