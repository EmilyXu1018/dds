to Dr. Chisolm.<br> Dr. Anagnos: Dr. Chisolm<br> could do nothing for the girl<br> and referred them to<br> Dr. Alexander Graham Bell.<br> As the girl is young,<br> and the parents are not<br> willing to send her to us,<br> l have put you up<br> for the role<br> of governess.<br> [lrish Accent]<br> Governess?<br> Or nursemaid.<br> We both knew you'd get<br> rid of me one of these days.<br> Dr. Anagnos: You've<br> accomplished so much here.<br> But when you first<br> came to us,<br> you couldn't even<br> spell your name.<br> Are your eyes<br> still so painful?<br> No. It's my ears, sir.<br> Tell me about the child.<br> ls she bright...<br> or dull?<br> [Sighs]<br> Can she be taught?<br> She's given to tantrums,<br> they say.<br> So am l.<br> Maybe you should warn<br> the Kellers about me.<br> l've told them nothing<br> of your histoy<br> except your qualifications<br> for the job.<br> Here is the money<br> for your train ticket.<br> And here is a gift<br> from all of us,<br> Dr. Anagnos:<br> with our love.<br> We're going to miss you.<br> Dr. Anagnos:<br> This is my last chance<br> to counsel you, Annie.<br> You lack tact<br> Dr. Anagnos: and the talent<br> to bend to others.<br> You're hard to fool<br> and harder to please,<br> but all the same,<br> we are proud of you.<br> We're off<br> to meet the train again.<br> Well, l hope<br> the girl is on this one.<br> Oh, she will be.<br> Well, we'll see you<br> at supper, then.<br> Giddy up.<br> Your mother's<br> not here, child.<br> l'm here, though.<br> l'm your father.<br> l'm your father.<br> l used to swing you<br> through the air,<br> and you weren't even<br> l wonder if you remember<br> any of that...<br> or any of us.<br> Here you are.<br> There's a piece<br> of candy for you.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> You want your mama,<br> don't you, missy?<br> Captain Keller, wouldn't<br> like this if he saw it,<br> but what's one little candy<br> going to hurt?<br> Watch your step,<br> sir.<br> Ma'am.<br> [Train Whistle Blows]<br> Man: Don't wory<br> about it, sir.<br> [Horse Neighs]<br> Miss Sullivan?<br> Yes.<br> l'm James Keller.<br> l had a brother,<br> Jimmie.<br> Are you Helen's...<br> Halfbrother.<br> Do you have a trunk?<br> Yes.<br> Heny, Percy.<br> Kate:<br> Miss Sullivan.<br> l'm so relieved.<br> We were beginning<br> to get a little bit<br> worried about you.<br> The man who sold me<br> that ticket<br> ought to be tied<br> to the tracks.<br> l'm Katherine Keller.<br> l'm Helen's mother.<br> You didn't bring Helen.<br> l was hoping you would.<br> Well<br> her father wanted<br> to spend the afternoon<br> with her, actually.<br> Kate: They so enjoy<br> their time together.<br> Kate, you should be<br> ashamed.<br> Miss Sullivan, you'll find<br> that in the south<br> James: we make up<br> these little stories<br> just to amuse<br> each other.<br> l hope you won't mind.<br> [Bell Rings]<br> [Train Whistle Blows]<br> Kate: How much can a blind<br> and deafchild learn,<br> Miss Sullivan?<br> l don't know.<br> Does she communicate<br> with you at all?<br> Oh, well, l always know<br> what she wants<br> if that's what you mean.<br> No, you don't.<br> All anybody knows<br> that if you give Helen<br> a piece of candy,<br> she'll be quiet<br> for a while.<br> Can you teach her<br> to sit still, Miss Sullivan?<br> l'd have to teach her<br> Ianguage first.<br> Language?<br> lf she doesn't<br> know words,<br> how could she know why<br> you want her to sit still?<br> Miss Sullivan,<br> perhaps you were misled<br> as to Helen's condition.<br> She can neither<br> see nor hear.<br> But if it is her senses<br> that are impaired<br> and not her mind,<br> she must have language.<br> Language is more<br> important to the mind<br> than light<br> is to the eye.<br> But how will you<br> teach her<br> if you can't talk to her?<br> Anyway l can.<br> Kate:<br> We are going to do<br> everything that we can<br> to help you.<br> l don't want you<br> to think of us<br> as strangers,<br> Miss Annie.<br> Annie: Strangers aren't<br> so strange to me.<br> l've been around them<br> all my life.<br> James:<br> Watch your step.<br> Welcome to Ivy Green,<br> Miss Sullivan.<br> l trust you had<br> a good journey.<br> Annie: l had several.<br> Thank you.<br> Where's Helen?<br> Oh, Miss Annie?<br> We've put you in<br> the upstairs corner room.<br> Now, if there is any breeze<br> at all this summer,<br> you're going<br> to feel it.<br> l'll take<br> my suitcase, thanks.<br> l have it,<br> Miss Sullivan.<br> No, please, let me.<br> l wouldn't<br> think of it.<br> l have something in it<br> for Helen.<br> l needn't to be treated<br> like a guest.<br> Now, when may l see Helen?<br> Well, there she is.<br> Kate:<br> That's Helen.<br> Unh!<br> [Slaps]<br> [Sniffs]<br> Unh.<br> Unh!<br> Unh!<br> She seems<br> vey rough, Kate.<br> Why didn't she take<br> her glasses off?<br> Well<br> the instituje said<br> that the light<br> hurts her eyes.<br> Apparently, she was nearly<br> blind as a child.<br> Blind?<br> Well, she's had<br> And they expect one blind<br> person to teach another one?<br> How long was she employed<br> at that school?<br> Well, she--she wasn't<br> employed there.<br> She was one<br> of their best students.<br> Student?<br> James: Now you have<br> to take care of,<br> Father.<br> You stay out of this.<br> James...<br> why do you have to be<br> so mean about Helen?<br> Why, to confirm my father's<br> view of me, of course.<br> Those are mine.<br> Yes, yes.<br> All right, then,<br> Helen.<br> '' Doll'' will be<br> your first word.<br> lt's as good as any.<br> '' D...''<br> ''O...''<br> '' L...''<br> '' L.''<br> Doll.<br> Doll.<br> lt has a name.<br> ''D...''<br> ''O...''<br> Annie: ''L...''<br> James:<br> Thank you, Henry.<br> Thank you, Percy.<br> So, what was that?<br> Some sort of game?<br> lt's an alphabet<br> for the deaf.<br> Each letter has a sign.<br> ''D...''<br> ''O...''<br> ''L...''<br> ''L.''<br> Doll.<br> First, she will learn<br> to imitate.<br> '' D,'' ''O...''<br> Ah!<br> James: Oh, she can imitate<br> things, all right--<br> like a regular<br> little monkey.<br> A bright little monkey.<br> Mmm...<br> '' D.''<br> James: l think she wants<br> her doll back.<br> She can have it back<br> when she spells it.<br> She has no idea<br> what words even are.<br> How can she spell them?<br> lf her fingers learn<br> the letters now,<br> then maybe someday<br> her brain will learn<br> that they have a meaning.<br> Did you make up<br> this alphabet?<br> Me? No.<br> Spanish monks<br> under a vow of silence,<br> which, Mr.James,<br> l wish you would take.<br> [Helen Moans]<br> [Sighs]<br> [Sniffs]<br> ''C...''<br> ''A...''<br> ''K...''<br> ''E.''<br> Cake.<br> ''C...''<br> ''A...''<br> ''K...''<br> ''E.''<br> Annie:<br> Very good.<br> Cake.<br> ''D...''<br> ''O...''<br> ''L...''<br> ''L.''<br> Uhh!<br> Mm-mm-mm.<br> Uhh!<br> [Sighs]<br> ''D...''<br> ''O...''<br> ''L...''<br> ''L.''<br> Vey good, Helen.<br> Vey good.<br> Good first lesson.<br> Very well done.<br> Very well done.<br> Ohh!

And l wondered<br> if she was bright.<br> She's the brightest one<br> in this house.<br> Where is<br> Miss Annie?<br> She's in her room.<br> Didn't anyone<br> call her to supper?<br> Arthur:James, go upstairs<br> and bring her down.<br> Certainly.<br> l'll get the ladder.<br> What?<br> l'll need a ladder.<br> It won't take long.<br> What are you<br> talking about?<br> Well, Helen locked her<br> in her room<br> and run off<br> with the key.<br> [Sighs]<br> And l suppose you are<br> going to sit there<br> and say nothing.<br> You told me it was<br> none of my business, Father.<br> l was just trying<br> to respect your wishes.<br> Miss Sullivan,<br> are you in there?<br> Yes, sir, l'm in here.<br> lsn't there a key<br> on your side?<br> [Whispering]<br> For God's sake.<br> No, sir.<br> There's no key, sir.<br> Put that ladder<br> away,Jimmy.<br> Whatever you say,<br> Father.<br> Kate: Captain, we can't<br> keep Miss Annie locked up<br> until we find the key.<br> James.<br> Bring the ladder back.<br> Whatever you say,<br> Father.<br> l hired her<br> to solve problems,<br> not create them.<br> Arthur:<br> Hold it, Jimmy.<br> Thank you, Percy.<br> Miss Sullivan!<br> Yes, Captain Keller?<br> l hope this is<br> not a sample<br> of what we can<br> expect of you.<br> Arthur: Come out<br> and sit on my shoulder.<br> l'm perfectly capable<br> of going down a ladder<br> by myself.<br> Do as l say,<br> Miss Sullivan.<br> Ohh.<br> [Bystanders Laugh]<br> Very chivalrous of you.<br> This is not chivaly.<br> This is practicality.<br> You're no good to us<br> trapped in a room.<br> Woman: Ooh.<br> [Applause]<br> Not in the house<br> Honestly, l don't see<br> how you managed it.<br> [Sighs]<br> l'll look<br> for the key, sir.<br> Thank you. Just don't<br> look in any rooms<br> that can be locked.<br> All right, eveyone.<br> Excitement's over.<br> l'd better leave<br> the L-A-D-D-E-R.<br> [Laughs]<br> Oh, you little devil.<br> lf you think you can<br> get rid of me that easily,<br> you're wrong.<br> l have nothing better to do<br> and nowhere else to go.<br> Annie: To the best<br> of my knowledge,<br> no one in this house<br> has ever tried<br> to control the girl,<br> but...<br> how can l discipline her<br> without<br> breaking her spirit?<br> But...<br> if she won't obey me...<br> Oh!<br> Ohh.<br> Tsk.<br> lnk.<br> lt has a name.<br> Pen.<br> Pen.<br> Uhh!<br> [Moans]<br> No, Helen.<br> [Gasps]<br> Annie: Ohh!<br> Bad...<br> Annie:<br> girl.<br> Kate: No. Never you mind,<br> Miss Annie. It's--<br> lt's not the first.<br> No, Helen.<br> The Captain thinks that<br> your spelling eveything<br> that Helen does<br> is like spelling<br> to a fence post.<br> You talk to the baby,<br> don't you?<br> Does she understand<br> what you mean?<br> Not yet,<br> but she will someday<br> if she hears<br> enough words.<br> l'm letting Helen<br> hear the words.<br> Kate: How long<br> will it take?<br> A million words, maybe.<br> Annie: Pen.<br> Did you see that?<br> Annie:<br> l spelled ''pen.''<br> She spelled ''cake.''<br> She wants to see if l can<br> tell the difference.<br> There's is nothing impaired<br> in that head, Mrs. Keller.<br> Helen is smart...<br> and angry.<br> l can use that.<br> Can you teach me<br> those letters?<br> l'll start tomorrow.<br> lf both of us<br> are spelling to her,<br> that makes only about<br> half a million words each.<br> [Laughs]<br> Ow!<br> Helen!<br> Helen: Uhh!<br> Helen.<br> [Moaning]<br> [Stops Moaning]<br> Why does she get<br> a reward for stabbing me?<br> l--l don't know.<br> l'm--l'm sorry.<br> [Rooster Crows]<br> James:<br> Miss Sullivan,<br> breakfast is ready.<br> Shall l get<br> the ladder?<br> That's enough,Jimmy.<br> Oh, good morning,<br> Miss Annie.<br> Good morning.<br> Morning.<br> l hope you've settled in<br> comfortably, Miss Sullivan.<br> Thank you, Captain.<br> l have.<br> Arthur:<br> Please, help yourself.<br> Miss Annie, if there is ever<br> anything that you need,<br> please let us know.<br> Tobacco prices are up,<br> Father.<br> We should earn a nice profit<br> this year for a change.<br> Arthur: It used<br> to be that a man<br> could make a good living<br> running a farm.<br> James: Well, perhaps<br> if you'd teave<br> your pet newspaper<br> and come show me<br> my business,<br> we could make<br> some real money.<br> Arthur: Not in front<br> of Miss Sullivan.<br> Why not in front<br> of Miss Sullivan?<br> Kate: Miss Annie,<br> Helen is used<br> to helping herself<br> from our plates.<br> l'm afraid<br> l'm not used to it.<br> Arthur:<br> No, of course not.<br> Viney, please bring<br> Miss Sullivan another plate.<br> There's nothing wrong<br> with my plate, Captain,<br> only that Helen's hands<br> don't belong in it.<br> One plate is hardly worth<br> spoiling our breakfast over.<br> Kate: You see, she's just<br> going to keep trying<br> until she gets herway.<br> Arthur: l must insist<br> that you let the girl go.<br> Unh!<br> Arthur:<br> Thank you.<br> Unh!<br> - [Kicks]<br> - Oh!<br> [Moaning]<br> Oh, look, now<br> she's hurt herself.<br> No, she hasn't. l know<br> a tantrum when l see one<br> and a badly spoiled<br> child.<br> Miss Sullivan.<br> Please,<br> show some pity.<br> For this kind<br> of behavior?<br> Annie: Pity's the one<br> thing she doesn't need.<br> The whole house waits<br> on her hand and foot.<br> - Hear, hear.<br> - You stay out of this.<br> Letting Helen<br> have her own way--<br> it's really<br> such a small thing.<br> Small? It's seems<br> you've all decided<br> it's easier<br> to feel sory for Helen<br> than to teach her<br> how to behave.<br> Well, l've not seen<br> that you've taught her<br> anything yet, Miss Sullivan.<br> Quite right, Captain.<br> Well observed.<br> l'll start right now<br> if you'll leave the room.<br> Leave the room?<br> Annie: Yes.<br> Please, Captain.<br> Right now, if you'll<br> leave the room.<br> Miss Sullivan--<br> lf you're not willing<br> to stand up to one tantrum,<br> l cannot teach her<br> anything.<br> Unh!<br> Mrs. Keller,<br> you asked if there was<br> anything l needed.<br> Yes, but l--<br> l need to be alone<br> with Helen.<br> [Moaning]<br> Annie: Right now.<br> Miss Sullivan--<br> Kate: Captain.<br> Kate: James.<br> Captain, may l speak<br> with you outside?<br> Give us a moment,<br> please.<br> Oh...<br> [Helen Continues Moaning]<br> This is absurd.<br> Arthur, l'm sure<br> that she is only trying<br> to do what is best.<br> l will not have my house<br> turned into a circus.<br> [Moans]<br> Unless there is<br> a change in attitude,<br> Miss Sullivan<br> is dismissed.<br> Arthur, and then what hope<br> do we have for Helen?<br> No less than<br> we had before,<br> and then perhaps<br> we can regain some quiet.<br> [Helen Moans]<br> [Helen Tapping Floor]<br> Ow!<br> Ow!<br> Shh. Shh.<br> Ohh!<br> [Cries]<br> Shh, shh, shh.<br> [Moaning]<br> [Doorknob Rattles]<br> [Sighs]<br> Helen.<br> [Helen Banging On Door]<br> Oh, God.<br> [Both Breathing Heavily]<br> [Helen Hits

[Sighs]<br> Ahh!<br> [Church Bell Ringing]<br> What you want me to do,<br> Miss Kate?<br> lt's noon time,<br> and the breakfast dishes<br> ain't been cleared.<br> [Objects Clatter]<br> [Door Closes]<br> - [Cying]<br> - Hush, now.<br> Come on.<br> Viney: Shh.<br> [Moaning Softly]<br> Helen...<br> ate from<br> her own plate<br> with a spoon<br> Annie:<br> all by herself...<br> and she folded<br> her napkin.<br> The room's a wreck,<br> but she folded<br> her napkin.<br> l'll be in my room,<br> Mrs. Keller.<br> Viney: Shh, shh.<br> Oh, Helen.<br> Viney: Don't be long now,<br> Miss Annie.<br> Lunch going to be ready<br> right away.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> My Helen folded her napkin.<br> What are you reading?<br> [Annie Sighs]<br> Dr. Howe's account<br> of his patient<br> Laura Bridgman.<br> She was deaf.<br> blind, and mute<br> from the age of 2.<br> Did he succeed with her?<br> He did.<br> Then it is possible.<br> Annie: With patience,<br> l suppose--<br> something they did not<br> give me a certificate for<br> at Perkins.<br> Kate: After<br> this morning's lesson...<br> the Captain wants me<br> to dismiss you,<br> but l am going to insist<br> that you remain.<br> Thank you.<br> Where is your family,<br> Miss Annie?<br> My brotherJimmie<br> was the last l had.<br> He died 12 years ago.<br> l'm sory. l--<br> l tried to protect him.<br> l failed.<br> lt's no use<br> trying to protect<br> or speak<br> for other people.<br> Not really.<br> The only hope<br> is to teach them<br> to do it for themselves.<br> Annie: That's what l'm<br> trying to do with Helen.<br> What you demand<br> of her now<br> is all she'll ever be.<br> Step.<br> Unh!<br> [Sighs]<br> Captain.<br> And if what happened<br> this morning wasn't enough,<br> Helen can't stand<br> to be near her.<br> Things have gotten worse,<br> and l want you<br> to give her notice.<br> No.<br> [Sighs]<br> Well, if you won't,<br> l must.<br> Annie: Good evening,<br> Captain, Mrs. Keller.<br> Uh...<br> Miss Sullivan...<br> l find that l am not<br> satisfied with this--<br> That is,<br> this arrangement--<br> Arthur: Will you please<br> take off your glasses?<br> l find it very difficult to<br> speak to you with them on.<br> Annie:<br> Well, of course.<br> lf you must, keep them on.<br> Now, Miss Sullivan--<br> Annie: Please tell me,<br> Captain, is the little house<br> in the grove of trees<br> being used for anything?<br> The garden house?<br> Arthur: This is just<br> what l am talking about.<br> Miss Sullivan, if you<br> expect to stay on here,<br> there must be<br> a change in your manner.<br> Arthur: And you must<br> convince me<br> that there is the slightest<br> hope of teaching a child<br> who flees from you<br> like the plague.<br> You could<br> show some sympathy.<br> You're absolutely right,<br> Captain.<br> There is not<br> the slightest possibility<br> of teaching a child<br> who runs away from me.<br> lt is hopeless here,<br> and the sooner we realize that,<br> the sooner we can get<br> to a solution.<br> lt is not hopeless!<br> Helen could talk by the time<br> she was 10 months old.<br> Before this illness,<br> she was<br> such a good child.<br> Yes, she was<br> an extraordinay child.<br> l believe that,<br> but she's not<br> that child anymore.<br> l've seen pets behave<br> better than she does<br> and it's your pity<br> that's the cause of it.<br> l beg your pardon!<br> l'm afraid<br> your love for Helen<br> is a greater<br> handicap to her<br> than her blindness<br> or her deafness.<br> Annie, before you came,<br> we spoke of putting<br> Helen in an asylum.<br> Please don't give up.<br> Obviously, Miss Sullivan<br> thinks it's hopeless.<br> Here!<br> lt's hopeless here!<br> l'm only<br> just beginning!<br> [Sighs]<br> Please let me show you.<br> Please follow me.<br> [Frogs Croaking]<br> God knows what this<br> has to do with anything.<br> Captain:<br> This is ridiculous.<br> l believe l can only<br> make progress with Helen<br> If l have complete<br> charge of her.<br> But you already<br> have that.<br> Annie: No.<br> l mean day and night.<br> She must depend on me.<br> For what?<br> For eveything!<br> Her food, her clothes<br> her play time, her sweets.<br> All of these things<br> are tools<br> Annie: that l can use<br> to reach her.<br> And how do you<br> propose to do that<br> when she runs away<br> from you?<br> lf she can run to you,<br> l have no hope.<br> Annie:Which is why<br> l must live with her<br> somewhere else.<br> Annie:<br> You can bring Helen here<br> after a long carriage ride.<br> She won't know<br> where she is,<br> Annie: and you can still<br> see her every day,<br> provided she does not know<br> you're here.<br> How long would you<br> keep her?<br> Annie:<br> As long as it takes.<br> l know this is the way!<br> And, Captain,<br> l cannot be rude to you<br> if you're not around<br> to interfere with me.<br> Am l to understand<br> that ifl say no to this,<br> you will abandon your charge<br> to an asylum?<br> An asylum is no place<br> for Helen, Captain.<br> Believe me, l know.<br> l grew up in an asylum--<br> in the state poorhouse,<br> my brother and l--<br> until it took his life.<br> Our playroom<br> was the deadhouse<br> where they kept the bodies until<br> they could dig the graves.<br> Annie:<br> It made me strong,<br> but Helen<br> is strong enough already.<br> Please give me this chance.<br> Give her this chance<br> to save herself.<br> Miss Sullivan,<br> do you like this child?<br> Do you?<br> Captain...<br> with your permission.<br> l'll give you 2 weeks.<br> Arthur:<br> You have 2 weeks<br> to get the child<br> to toterate you.<br> Kate:<br> Percy could stay here.<br> He could run errands<br> for you.<br> is not enough.<br> is what l am offering.<br> l'll take it.<br> [Pigeons Cooing]<br> Where would you like<br> your suitcase, Miss Sullivan?<br> Oh, anywhere is fine.<br> How do you expect<br> to win her over in this place?<br> James: You plan to<br> tie her to the chair?<br> How is it you have<br> no pity for Helen?<br> To have pity for someone<br> is a waste of energy.<br> Feeling sorry for<br> ourselves is even worse.<br> Well, l hope you win,<br> Miss Sullivan.<br> Unh!<br> Kate: Well, we rode<br> in the country for2 hours.<br> For all she knows<br> she could be in anothe town.<br> Bring her inside,<br> please.<br> Oh, she wants me.<br> She can have you back<br> in 2 weeks.<br> Miss Annie, please<br> take good care of her.<br> l will.<br> [Helen Moaning]<br> Aah!<br> Hush, hush, hush.<br> Hush, hush.<br> Unh!<br> [Moaning]<br> Oh.<br> [Helen Cying]<br> [Moans]<br> Annie: Percy!<br> Wake up.<br> l need your help.<br> Ohh.<br> [Moans]<br> Try again.<br> Try again.<br> [Moans]<br> [Sniffs]<br> Good.<br> Let me go.<br> She gonna<br> pinch me.<br> l think she's<br> trying to talk.<br> She can talk, but<br> she's got to use her hands.<br> Here.<br> Let me show you.<br> Aah!<br> She's mad at me now,<br> so she doesn't want to play,<br> but she knows<br> a lot of letters.<br> ''C...''<br> ''A...''<br> ''K...''<br> ''E.''<br> Annie: Cake.<br> "C..."<br> ''A...''<br> ''K...''<br> ''E.''<br> [Moans]<br> She spells cake,<br> she gets cake.<br> She doesn't know<br> what the word means yet...<br> but she will.<br> Percy.<br> We don't need her.<br> How would you like to learn<br> one she doesn't know?<br> Annie:<br> ''M'' is easy.<br> ''l'' is even easier--<br> Just the pinkie up.<br> Annie: ''L.''<br> '' K.''<br> '' M.'' Why should l<br> talk to you?<br> l'm teaching Percy.<br> M-l-L-K.<br> No.<br> l'm teaching Percy.<br> Ooh, you're jealous.<br> [Moans]<br> ''M...''<br> ''I...''<br> ''L...''<br> ''K.''<br> [Sighs]<br> Annie: At least l'm back<br> to where l can touch you.<br> You can go<br> back to bed, Percy.<br> Thank you.<br> [Sighs]<br> l never thought that life<br> could be so quiet.<br> l miss her, too.<br> # Hush, little baby#<br> # Don't say a word #<br> # Mama's gonna buy you<br> a mockingbird #<br> # If that mockingbird<br> don't sing #<br> # Mama's gonna buy you<br> a diamond ring

understand?<br> We were just about<br> to have lunch.<br> How is she, Miss Annie?<br> Fine.<br> Annie: l taught her<br> that stitch yesterday.<br> Now l can't get her<br> to stop.<br> lt's so quiet in the house<br> without her.<br> Kate: Well, when<br> the Captain and James<br> aren't bickering,<br> that is.<br> l noticed<br> they don't get along.<br> Oh, well, they used to<br> when James' mother<br> was alive.<br> Kate: But then Helen<br> came along,<br> and, well, she takes up<br> so much of our attention.<br> [Sniffs]<br> Soup.<br> Annie:<br> Ooh, such a lady.<br> She'd rather starve<br> than eat without a spoon.<br> You have taught her<br> so much<br> in a weekand a half.<br> Annie:<br> It's not enough.<br> Obedience is not enough.<br> She knows so many words.<br> lf only she knew<br> what they meant.<br> Kate: And how will<br> she learn?<br> The way a bird learns<br> to use its wings.<br> lt has to come.<br> But how, Miss Annie?<br> l...<br> need...<br> more...<br> time.<br> Alone with her?<br> Annie: Yes.<br> Why not?<br> Because l can't--<br> l --<br> Annie: Spell it.<br> lf she ever learns,<br> you're the first person<br> she's going to want<br> to talk

we're onto<br> something here.<br> [Horse Neighs]<br> James: Father?<br> Hello, Francis.<br> James.<br> Captain.<br> Thought l'd come<br> take a look around.<br> We had an idea last year<br> and tried something,<br> and it looks like 22 inches<br> between the plants<br> gives us<br> about twice the yield.<br> Twice the yield?<br> Francis:<br> We had that blue mold<br> pretty bad<br> last year, sir.<br> We think it's carying<br> over the winter<br> in the roots<br> so we're going<br> to ty to get<br> all the roots and stalks<br> out of the ground<br> after the harvest.<br> Well, with<br> the roots gone,<br> we get a bad rain,<br> we stand to lose<br> a whole layer of topsoil.<br> Well, l was thinking<br> of that, too.<br> Let's plant some low<br> grass for the winter.<br> Look for some,<br> would you, Francis?<br> Did you need<br> something, Father?<br> l think l have it, Jimmy.<br> Sorry to interrupt.<br> Horse.<br> Horse...<br> eats...<br> apple.<br> How l have waited<br> for

not only Helen who needs<br> to learn how to talk.<br> Things will be<br> very different here<br> if Helen is better.<br> l know.<br> Who will l blame then<br> for my unhappiness?<br> Annie: If only there was<br> someone to help me.<br> l feel l need a teacher<br> as much as Helen does.<br> [Horse Neighs]<br> Arthur: Whoa.<br> [Sighs]<br> [Dog Barking]<br> Ohh.<br> Captain.<br> Miss Sullivan,
