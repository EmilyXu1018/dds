                        Notice the elegance of the proof.<br> lt's beautiful!<br> lt reminds me<br> of a quote from Socrates:<br> ''lf measure and symmetry are absent<br> from any composition, -<br> - the ruin awaits both the<br> ingredients and the composition.''<br> ''Measure and symmetry are beauty<br> and virtue the world over.''<br> - Do you think he's straight?<br> - Yeah, he's too boring to be gay.<br> - ls it 5:15?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> Thank you ...<br> l'm releasing you a half hour early<br> today. l have ... an appointment.<br> l'm giving a lecture on my new book<br> tonight. You are all welcome.<br> Thank you.<br> Rose, get that mask off your face.<br> lt'll clog your pores.<br> You're going to be late.<br> lt's almost seven o'clock.<br> You bum! Three million dollars<br> a year! For what?<br> Come on.<br> Just one more out.<br> - Barry Neufeld.<br> - Hi, it's Rose.<br> Hi ... Not again.<br> l think it's an allergic reaction<br> to something l ate.<br> - My throat's starting to close up.<br> - lt sounds like you're dying.<br> - Sure you're not allergic to me?<br> - That's a terrible thing to think!<br> Every Manhattan restaurant hates me<br> for not keeping reservations.<br> Why don't you call me next week?<br> lf you still want to.<br> - Feel better.<br> - Thank you. Bye.<br> - Should l start with a joke?<br> - No, there's not enough time.<br> - For what?<br> - To develop a sense of humour.<br> And now, ladies and gentlemen,<br> the author of ''Absolute Truth'', -<br> - Columbia's very own<br> Professor Gregory Larkin.<br> You're going to be fine.<br> Thank you. l'm honoured by this<br> warm and gracious welcome.<br> Being here, at the end of a journey,<br> l'm reminded of Descartes' words:<br> ''Whether l am awake or asleep, two<br> and three will always make five.''<br> ''lt does not seem possible that<br> such a truth can be questioned.''<br> This book has taken me<br> over 14 years to write.<br> lt is with sadness l say goodbye<br> to it consuming my days and nights.<br> And nights ...<br> And as l stand here ...<br> ln coming up ...<br> "summing" up ...<br> Excuse me,<br> l'm feeling a little dizzy.<br> l thought it would feel differently.<br> l thought l'd know more. l don't.<br> l don't know anything, really.<br> Thank you all for coming.<br> What did l say?<br> lt was fine, though you shouldn't<br> work for a suicide hotline.<br> - You did fine until Candice came.<br> - Don't start. l just forgot to eat.<br> lt's natural. She left you what,<br> a year ago?<br> Thank God Candy left when she did,<br> or l'd never have finished the book.<br> You're a guy who can't have sex<br> and chew gum at the same time.<br> When l'm with someone, l tend<br> to get a little sidetracked.<br> - 14 years? ls that sidetracked?<br> - l bet she's still out there.<br> lf l know Candice, she's out there.<br> She's out there.<br> Face her like a grown-up.<br> - Don't let me go home with her.<br> - lt would be odd not to invite ...<br> Just don't let me go home with her.<br> Are you all right?<br> - lt was the stupid wine. Hello.<br> - You look great.<br> l hope you don't mind me showing up<br> like this on your big night.<br> lt's just that l've been<br> thinking so much about you lately.<br> - Do you want to go get a drink?<br> - l'd better not.<br> - A bite to eat?<br> - No, l'm not hungry.<br> - Do you want me to take you home?<br> - Okay.<br> - Good to see you, Henry.<br> - But Greg ...<br> - Don't leave. Aren't you staying?<br> - Well, we're done.<br> - l still have feelings for you.<br> - But l dumped you for another man.<br> - And l'm still sort of with Paul.<br> - l thought that was over.<br> He cheated. l wanted to feel better<br> about myself before l see him.<br> - That's why you're here?<br> - Well, yeah.<br> You were always a nice guy.<br> But let's face it, -<br> - we've nothing in common except<br> sex, and the fact you idolize me.<br> l really do care for you.<br> - l just can't wind up with you.<br> - Can l call you sometime?<br> What for?<br> - Are you going?<br> - No, l cancelled.<br> What do you want to do for dinner?<br> Make that pasta with artichokes.<br> Later we can figure out what to do<br> with your hair for Claire's wedding.<br> What is this?<br> Look at that.<br> The mating ritual<br> is both speedy and violent.<br> The lesser male often covers<br> the larger female.<br> lf unsuccessful in mounting, the<br> male is often eaten by the female.<br> We're the girls of 1-400 Hot Talk.<br> Briana, Tina, Marla<br> and me: Felicia.<br> Anything you want to talk about,<br> call me ...<br> - l don't know where to begin.<br> - Are you lonely tonight, darling?<br> - So am l. What are you wearing?<br> - Nothing special.<br> - Can l ask you a question?<br> - l'm just wearing a towel.<br> l was drying myself off,<br> after a hot shower ...<br> Why do women leave?<br> Why do they leave? Especially<br> pretty ones. l can't do it any more.<br> Life is very complex.<br> There are no guarantees.<br> The mathematical world<br> is completely rational.<br> You think too much. Don't you want<br> to know how big my tits are?<br> No! l just want to share my life<br> with someone.<br> Someone<br> l'm not sexually attracted to.<br> How can two people come together<br> in lasting respect and affection?<br> - The world's run by sex ads.<br> - Take out your own ad, l guess.<br> An ad?<br> Look at me. l'm a grown woman<br> wearing a prom dress.<br> l look like an over-the-hill<br> Barbie doll. And it's too tight.<br> - l want something in my colour.<br> - Maids of honour don't wear black.<br> - Why aren't you wearing make-up?<br> - l am wearing make-up.<br> - You'd look good with a perm.<br> - Like Shirley Temple on crack.<br> Where is she? She can't stand that<br> l'm getting all the attention.<br> - We should've had her committed.<br> - For excessive vanity?<br> How wonderful! Two compassionate<br> daughters. No make-up today?<br> l am wearing make-up.<br> - What the hell are you wearing?<br> - lt's an imitation Scassi.<br> - You're my mother, not the singer.<br> - l'll go home and change.<br> Stop it. We're late.<br> The priest is sweating.<br> All celibates sweat, dear.<br> lf they didn't, they'd explode.<br> l bought a snack. lf l sit through<br> this without eating, l'll pass out.<br> lt'll only take 45 minutes.<br> Marrying outside your faith,<br> and on the sabbath ...<br> All l know about the sabbath is that<br> Bergdorff's isn't too crowded.<br> l want you to remember,<br> today is my day.<br> Behave, or l'll blow up your birth<br> certificate into a Christmas card.<br> l should have never<br> encouraged you to speak.<br> Maybe she'll look back<br> and turn into a pillar of salt.<br> Alex looks nervous.<br> - l hope l'm doing the right thing.<br> - l think you are.<br> The party is about to get started.<br> The dance floor is all yours!<br> Okay girls, lick your lips.<br> Tell Claire l'm looking for her.<br> Your husband's a lucky guy.<br> - Waiter! Can we have more dressing?<br> - We were separated at birth.<br> - Two more drinks, when you can.<br> - This looks delicious.<br> - l can't believe he's married.<br> - And that he chose Claire over you.<br> - l told you not to introduce them.<br> - She was married, l didn't think.<br> - How are you handling all this?<br> - No more fantasies of handsome men.<br> - There's a guy out there somewhere.<br> - Who? Barry Neufeldt?<br> What's wrong with him, other than<br> that he looks like Gumpy?<br> Gumby, not Gumpy.<br> - l'm no great prize, either.<br> - You're a great person and teacher.<br> l think l've reached the point where<br> you know you'll never get married.<br> Married? What's marriage? A ring,<br> a contract. Fighting, compromising.<br> lt can be more than that. You know<br> what l envy about people in love?<br> l'd love it<br> if someone really knew me.<br> What l like. What l'm afraid of.<br> What kind of toothpaste l use.<br> l think<br> that would really be wonderful.<br> Hey, sister-in-law,<br> having a good time?<br> - Have you seen Claire?<br> - No, l'll find her for you.<br> You look beautiful tonight. l'm not<br> just saying that. You really<br> l heard you.<br> Why don't you have some coffee?<br> l'll find Claire.<br> - Alex is looking for you.<br> - Brother, it's starting already?<br> How could you do this?<br> l'll never forgive you.<br> - Yes ..!<br> - l'm Professor Gregory Larkin.<br> l'm calling about the response to<br> my ad. ls this Professor Morgan?<br> - l'm her sister. She knows nothing.<br> - Then maybe we shouldn't talk.<br> No! Rose would never answer herself.<br> Most of these guys are creeps.<br> But when it said you taught<br> at Columbia, something just clicked.<br> - You have seen her picture, right?<br> - Yes.<br> - And ..?<br> - And what?<br> Nothing. Great.<br> Make way, please.<br> This is the scene<br> at my sister's wedding.<br> She's getting drunk, regretting that<br> she got married for the third time.<br> My mom's sprouting snakes from her<br> hair in jealousy. lt was perfect ...<br> We've got three feminine archetypes:<br> The divine whore, Medusa -<br> - and me. What archetype am l?<br> - The Virgin Mary?<br> - Thanks a lot, Trevor.<br> No, the faithful handmaiden. Always<br> the bridesmaid, never the bride.<br> lt proves what Jung said all along.<br> Myths and archetypes are alive<br> and well and living in my apartment.<br> As l stood beside the altar beside<br> my sister and her husband to be, -<br> - it struck me that this ritual,<br> a wedding ceremony, -<br> - is the last scene of a fairy tale.<br> They never say what happens after.<br> That Cinderella drove the prince mad<br> by obsessively cleaning the castle.<br> They don't say what happens after<br> because there is no after.<br> The be-all and end-all<br> of romantic love was ... Mike?<br> - Sex?<br> - You have sex on the brain.<br> - Marriage.<br> - But it wasn't always like that.<br> The 12th century had ''courtly love'',<br> which had nothing to do with sex.<br> The relationship between a knight<br> and a married lady of the court ...<br> And so they could never<br> consummate their love.<br> They rose above ''going to the toilet<br> in front of each other'' love, -<br> - and went after<br> something more divine.<br> They took sex out of the equation,<br> leaving them with a union of souls.<br> Think of this. Sex was always<br> the fatal love potion.<br> Look at the literature of the time.<br> All consummation could lead to was<br> madness, despair or death.<br> Experts, scholars and my Aunt Esther<br> are united in one belief:<br> True love has spiritual dimensions,<br> while romantic love is a lie.<br> A myth. A soulless manipulation.<br> And speaking of manipulation ...<br> lt's like going to the movies<br> and seeing the lovers kiss ...<br> The music swells,<br> and we buy it, right?<br> So when my date kisses me, and l<br> don't hear strings, l dump him.<br> The question is,<br> why do we buy it?<br> Because, myth or manipulation,<br> we all want to fall in love.<br> That experience makes us feel<br> completely alive.<br> Our everyday reality is shattered,<br> and we are flung into the heavens.<br> lt may only last a moment, an hour,<br> but that doesn't diminish its value.<br> We're left with memories we<br> treasure for the rest of our lives.<br> l read, ''When we fall in love,<br> we hear Puccini in our heads.''<br> l love that. His music expresses our<br> need for passion and romantic love.<br> We listen to La Bheme or Turandot,<br> or read Wuthering Heights, -<br> - or watch Casablanca, and a little<br> of that love lives in us too.<br> So the final question is:<br> Why do people want to fall in love -<br> - when it can have such a short run<br> and be so painful?<br> - Propagation of the species?<br> - We need to connect with somebody.<br> - Are we culturally preconditioned?<br> - Good, but too intellectual for me.<br> l think it's because,<br> as some of you may already know ...<br> While it does last,<br> it feels fucking great.<br> l'm almost finished,<br> and you haven't started yet.<br> The perfect bite.<br> You need a therapist.<br> Do we have to have the TV on?<br> Can't we have a conversation?<br> l'm not intellectually stimulating,<br> like your university people ...<br> l'm sorry. How was your day, Mother?<br> - Who gives a shit?<br> - l said l was sorry. Let's talk.<br> l've lived too long.<br> l should be dead.<br> Give me that! Talk to me already!<br> All right. You haven't even noticed<br> l had my hair done differently.<br> l thought you looked different.<br> lt looks great.<br> - What's different about it?<br> - The ...<br> Nothing. You're just like<br> your father. So easy to trip up.<br> - So, how was work?<br> - Same as always.<br> Though l had one customer in<br> for a make-over. She needed one.<br> Dyed blonde hair. Blue eyeshadow.<br> Ash-brown foundation. Hideous.<br> - She was shocked over my age.<br> - How old were you?<br> Sorry.<br> l ran into Mr. Jenkins again.<br> He cornered me in the elevator.<br> He invited me to an Alzheimer's<br> benefit. l said forget it.<br> l can't believe he still asks you.<br> Why don't you go with him sometime?<br> No ... l raised two daughters.<br> l buried a husband. That's my life.<br> l don't want to start another.<br> And he knows my situation with you.<br> You won't see him because of me?<br> How would it look? The mother's<br> dating and the daughter stays home?<br> Who's looking?<br> Hello ... Hi.<br> Hello, this is ...<br> Hello, l'm Gregory Larkin.<br> Professor Gregory Larkin.<br> Answer the phone. l'm sleeping.<br> ls Professor Larkin there?<br> l mean, is Professor Morgan there?<br> - Barely.

He mustn't think he's<br> the only date you've had in years.<br> Where's the bow?<br> Hey, your mother did you up again.<br> Looks great! Can l get you a cab?<br> Sorry.<br> Are you sure?<br> You're going to take me?<br> Here's where l'm going, but don't go<br> until l put up the window.<br> - They're broke, lady.<br> - My hair!<br> Don't complain to me.<br> Complain to the cab company.<br> - l'm sorry.<br> - For what? You're exactly on time.<br> My hair. l must look like<br> l was attacked by wolves.<br> l didn't even notice.<br> Could you excuse me while l go<br> to the ladies' room for a minute?<br> Do you enjoy dancing?<br> l used to love to dance<br> with my father. You?<br> l find it embarrassing.<br> l enjoy watching it.<br> - Watching?<br> - Pairs ...<br> lt's interesting how coupling<br> appears in nature and mathematics.<br> - You were talking about pairs ...<br> - Oh, the twin-prime conjecture.<br> lt explores pairs of prime numbers.<br> Those only divisible by themselves.<br> Three-five. Five-seven.<br> Not seven-nine ...<br> - Nine can be divided by three.<br> - That's right.<br> lt was discovered that pairs<br> were often separated by ...<br> - One number in between.<br> - Exactly. Did you read my book?<br> - No, l'm sorry.<br> - That's okay. This is marvellous.<br> - A first date like a game show.<br> - l didn't mean to lecture.<br> l'm sorry,<br> l didn't mean to call it a date.<br> lt's just rare that l meet a person<br> l can discuss these things with.<br> - Some pepper?<br> - No, not for me.<br> Could you bring me a side dish<br> of extra dressing?<br> l don't particularly like salad,<br> l just like the dressing.<br> lnteresting theory. Are there still<br> pairs like that past a million?<br> l can't believe you thought of that.<br> That is what is to be proven.<br> l have concert tickets next<br> Saturday. Can we do this again?<br> - Sure.<br> - Great. Terrific.<br> What was it you wanted to discuss<br> about my teaching?<br> l have to confess. That was<br> just an excuse to meet you.<br> l hope you don't mind.<br> l found it interesting. l have many<br> questions, the first of which is:<br> How do you get them to stay?<br> Well?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What happened to your hair?<br> Don't ask.<br> - You won't be seeing him again?<br> - We're going out next week.<br> So, he must like you.<br> Did he kiss you?<br> No.<br> That's kind of sweet, actually.<br> Hi.<br> This is Cindy.<br> This is a spectrum analyzer.<br> lt makes graphic representations<br> of the music. Watch.<br> - Who's the girl?<br> - Rose Morgan.<br> Henry Fine is a professor<br> in anthropology.<br> Beautiful music, isn't it?<br> Beautiful atmosphere.<br> l enjoyed that.<br> Thank you so much for inviting me.<br> Why don't you come up? l'd like<br> to give you a copy of my book.<br> l'd love that. Your book, l mean.<br> Not to come up to your apartment.<br> But Rose, l'm inviting you.<br> lf you like this kind of music,<br> l have some wonderful CD's, but ...<br> ... they're also in my apartment.<br> l have to be honest with you.<br> l'm a bit out of practice with this.<br> l want you to feel comfortable.<br> That's important to me.<br> l want to tell you upfront.<br> l'm not interested in sex.<br> - You're not?<br> - And it has nothing to do with you.<br> lt has to do with what you were<br> talking about in your class.<br> l, too, believe it's illusions about<br> love and the emphasis on sex -<br> - that separate people today.<br> As you said, romance is a myth.<br> l was referring to academic opinions<br> that are purely subjective.<br> You were right! Relationships based<br> on romantic love are worthless.<br> Did you stay for my whole class?<br> l left when you mentioned the music<br> we hear when lovers kiss in films.<br> lt is manipulative! ln real life,<br> we don't hear music when we kiss.<br> And the person you're with isn't a<br> movie star. lt's a malicious ...<br> Fantasy? ls it all right<br> if l sit down for a minute?<br> The addiction to beauty and<br> perfection created by advertising -<br> - feeds on people's pathetic hopes.<br> They don't have their own opinions.<br> The media tells us what's beautiful.<br> TV shows tell us what a relationship<br> is supposed to be like. And sex!<br> l don't even want to tell you<br> how that's ruined my life ...<br> Well, l go crazy.<br> When l want someone sexually,<br> l go out of my mind.<br> Do you remember that film<br> where the woman kills the bunny?<br> - ''Fatal Attraction''?<br> - Granted, it was a film.<br> But l understand how she felt.<br> Not that l would kill an animal, -<br> - but l know the feeling of wanting<br> someone so much that it hurts.<br> This fiction, known as love,<br> drives people crazy, as you said.<br> - Then you're either mad, alone ...<br> - Or dead. But that was fiction.<br> Right! We're dead!<br> l do believe two people can<br> come together, even marry, -<br> - for reasons<br> more concrete than sex.<br> A love that grows out of respect,<br> love, trust, common interest.<br> Have you noticed that friendships<br> last longer than marriages?<br> The 12th century was on to<br> something. Would you like coffee?<br> - Got any scotch?<br> - Yeah.<br> Are you busy this week? l was hoping<br> you could help me with my teaching.<br> You give yourself too little credit.<br> Maybe you could sit in<br> on one of my classes.<br> lf X squared plus Y squared<br> equals 16, -<br> - how do we find DY/DX<br> as an implicit function of X and Y?<br> Well, Y is a function of X ...<br> You walk across the room like this,<br> and you're into your own thing.<br> Your body language is very detached,<br> very alienating.<br> l think you have to relate more<br> to the kids.<br> You're up there with your back to<br> the room, solving your own problems.<br> lt's like you're having a math<br> party, and only invited yourself.<br> - Relax. Loosen up. Have some fun.<br> - Relax. Have fun ... What else?<br> Loosen up. Put the pen down,<br> l'm not going to test you on this.<br> Come on. Teach me something.<br> lf a ball is thrown up into the air,<br> and its height, H, equals 100 T ...<br> What are you doing?<br> Turn around. Talk to me.<br> lf T is time in seconds,<br> at what limit is the speed ...<br> You lost me.<br> You have to put it in context.<br> - Jazz it up, put some humour in it.<br> - Humour in calculus?<br> - Well, try telling a story.<br> - A story?<br> Once upon a time ...<br> ... there was a ball.<br> lt was thrown into the air.<br> And its height ...<br> Maybe l should just write books.<br> No one understands those, either.<br> Just kidding.<br> - Don't give up. Try it again.<br> - Tell you another story?<br> Hi, Professor Larkin ... Sorry.<br> That's all right.<br> - Do we have an appointment?<br> - Actually, l wanted to make one.<br> Could you come back tomorrow?<br> After class?<br> - My head is swimming. lt's hot.<br> - Put your head between your legs.<br> Pretty girl.<br> With all that make-up?<br> You don't wear any, do you?<br> l'd still look like me,<br> only in colour.<br> You're too smart for that. You're<br> a confident, no-nonsense woman.<br> - l sound like an airline.<br> - l'm probably saying it wrong.<br> lt's just that<br> you don't need any of that.<br> Thanks.<br> How's your head?<br> - l think food will help you.<br> - Pizza, maybe?<br> Where can we go? Dancing?<br> Why did l say that?<br> There's that great dessert place.<br> All delicious things are fattening.<br> My mother would kill me.<br> What is that, Danish?<br> This is the one.<br> Trees are fascinating. They don't<br> have to touch to propagate.<br> You would find that fascinating ...<br> - How many do l need?<br> - One, two, three, four ...<br> Why didn't l see that?<br> - Thank you. l owe you one.<br> - lt's right in front of your eyes.<br> Six and a five.<br> l got you.<br> The pretzel! You can have mine.<br> You sounded excited on the phone.<br> l'm going to take my theory of love<br> as a man-made cultural creation -<br> - and expand it to include the<br> biological effect on the individual.<br> You need a hobby.<br> l can't believe you've dated<br> for three months and haven't kissed!<br> l can't believe you've dated<br> for three months and haven't kissed!<br> - How do you say hello?<br> - Well, we nod. lt works.<br> - You mean you haven't even touched?<br> - l fell once, and he picked me up.<br> We talk a lot. That's what we do.<br> And l don't worry about what l say,<br> what l wear, what l eat ...<br> lt's a relief to eat with a man, and<br> not worry that he'll be frightened.<br> He's fun to be with. Maybe ''fun''<br> isn't the word. He's interesting.<br> How many men can you say that about?<br> ls a tie too personal a gift?<br> Are you using it<br> on something other than his neck?<br> Does he look good in vests? Why do<br> you want him to meet your mother?<br> l kept saying l was a great cook,<br> so l offered him a birthday dinner.<br> Now l need something nice. After<br> meeting her, l won't see him again.<br> - l'm starving. Can we eat?<br> - l can't, l have a date.<br> - Find a gift for Dr. Strangelove.<br> - Who? We should get you some blush.<br> - l'm hungry, Claire.<br> - Fruit.<br> Why are you so grumpy?<br> lf he wasn't gorgeous, rich and<br> straight, l wouldn't have bothered.<br> l'm sick to death of the man<br> l am bound to for eternity.<br> Why are you saying that?<br> No matter where l go, what l do,<br> there he is.<br> ln the kitchen,<br> on the phone, on my finger.<br> l was asleep the other night.<br> When l wake up, he's staring at me.<br> - l think that's sweet.<br> - l think it's strange.<br> Do you know<br> how weird that makes me feel?<br> A lesbian dream, and he's staring<br> at me like l should include him.<br> l can't even fantasize in private.<br> Mom said you've been seeing<br> someone steady. ls he cute?<br> - What?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> l thought l'd meet you for coffee.<br> ls that a terrible thing to do?<br> Excuse me. l'm going<br> to the ladies' room. Alone.<br> Can you believe this weather? lt's<br> almost April and it's still cold.<br> l'm glad l have you alone.<br> Can l ask you a question?<br> lt'll sound strange, but ...<br> ls Claire happy?<br> l mean, do you think she's happy?<br> Yes, l think she is.<br> Why?<br> l'm being silly.<br> l'm a first-time husband.<br> lf she doesn't wake up<br> and tell me she's ecstatic, l worry.<br> lmagine, l have you to thank<br> for the fact that we're married.<br> You made this possible.<br> Knowing you has changed my life.<br> - Don't do that.<br> - What? What am l doing?<br> You don't even know, do you?<br> Rose ...<br> - Just tell Claire l had to run.<br> - Rose, l'm sorry.<br> l really thought l was over him.<br> l hate this. lt's so stupid.<br> l must sound so pathetic.<br> He asked if Claire was happy,<br> and l lied.<br> - lsn't that awful?<br> - Nothing criminal.<br> - Thanks for coming so quickly.<br> - Are you feeling better now?<br> A little.<br> - You know, Rose, it takes time.<br> - Yeah, l know.<br> l want you to know our friendship<br> really means a lot to me.<br> l feel the same way,<br> which is why tonight ...<br> l better go home, l have to get<br> dinner ready. l'll see you at eight.<br> Shall l bring anything<br> for your mother?<br> Yeah, a wooden stake<br> and a crucifix.<br> Rose loves to fold napkins.<br> lt's one of her idiosyncracies.<br> l came home late and threw this on.<br> God knows how l look.<br> - l hope you like it.<br> - My God, Rose, it's art!<br> lt's not art.<br> An artist isn't only one who paints.<br> lt's one who sets the table, -<br> - prepares a meal, or teaches<br> in a certain way. You're an artist.<br> Why didn't you use the Limoges?<br> May l serve you?<br> - Rose!<br> - My hands are clean.<br> We go to all this trouble,<br> and Rose and l don't eat very much.<br> l've always thought<br> she had a very healthy appetite.<br> l can't stand women who eat<br> two bites and say they're full.<br> Do you really need extra salt?<br> You know how it retains water.<br> - Can l have some? And potatoes.<br> - You don't need them.<br> Have you ever sat in<br> on one of your daughter's lectures?<br> - Rose!<br> - That's the best part.<br> Rose tells me<br> you've never been married.<br> That's all right, Rose.<br> That's true, Mrs. Morgan. l guess<br> l haven't found the right girl.<br> l've had relationships that haven't<br> worked out, but that will change.<br> Really? Why?<br> As l told Rose,<br> l have a theory about love ...<br> - And sex.<br> - Does anybody want coffee?<br> - What theory?<br> - Regular or decaf?<br> - Regular.<br> - l can make cappuccinos.<br> Would you like cappuccinos?<br> Greg, why don't you help me.<br> - Why don't you put the coffee on?<br> - l made dinner. You put it on.<br> l've raised two daughters, buried<br> a husband, l've made my coffee.<br> Alone at last.<br> - l've heard a lot about you.<br> - And l've heard a lot about you.<br> You've been seeing a lot<br> of my daughter.<br> l hope you don't mind my asking ...<br> What are your intentions?<br> My intentions?<br> What a lovely meal!<br> You're a good cook.<br> - l didn't oversell myself?<br> - Not at all, but the trouble ...<br> Of course l had to go to<br> the trouble. lt was your birthday.<br> What are friends for, but to give<br> each other presents and stuff ...<br> Happy birthday.<br> Open it up!<br> l really hope you like it.<br> - Dice?<br> - They once were dice.<br> - Now they're cuff links with ...<br> - Prime numbers!<br> - They're great! How'd you do that?<br> - l had them made just for you.<br> - They were done very fast.<br> - Thank you.<br> Well ...<br> l've wanted to ask you something,<br> and l can only say this once ...<br> Sit down.<br> We have a lot in common. Some<br> variables will remain unknown, -<br> - as is the case<br> with most complex equations ...<br> - Greg, talk to me.<br> - l'm not saying this right.<br> This feeling you have for Alex ...<br> lt won't be the same with me.<br> You won't have that ache in your<br> stomach, because we're not in love.<br> l think we share<br> a genuine affection for each other.<br> We share a passion for knowledge<br> rather than a physical passion.<br> Although, if sex is something<br> that interests you, -<br> - l'm sure l could provide that on<br> occasion, given enough warning.<br> - What are you saying?<br> - We were in love and miserable.<br> lt's a waste,<br> because as people, we're valuable.<br> When l look at you, l see a woman<br> unlike any other l've known before.<br> Your mind, your humour, your passion<br> for ideas. l'm very fond of you.<br> When l'm with you, l feel as if ...<br> ... as if l'm home.<br> So l think we should get married.<br> People marry for sex or beauty. Are<br> my reasons more insane than those?<br> Are you in shock, or just appalled?<br> Blink if you can hear me.<br> Why are you laughing?<br> l'm sorry. This sounds silly,<br> but l was just thinking ...<br> How could l marry someone<br> that l've never even ...<br> You know ...<br> ... kissed.<br> There's one thing l have to say.<br> l promised your sister l wouldn't.<br> You love Claire, too?<br> You just slept with her?<br> - You want to?<br> - l don't even know her.<br> lt's about how l found you.<br> l wrote this ad ...<br> l think that's kind of great.<br> - l thought you'd be upset.<br> - Why? You picked me.<br> Actually, l found you through this<br> charming woman on TV ...<br> Well, well, well ...<br> So?<br> Gregory just proposed to me.<br> Do you need a valium?<br> l know you don't respect my opinion,<br> but l don't trust him.<br> - l mean, where's the attraction?<br> - He's not attracted to me.<br> He doesn't want sex.<br> He wants to be companions.<br> What sane person would agree to that<br> kind of marriage? lt's not natural.<br> Are Claire and Alex natural?<br> He wants me, Mother!<br> He wants you to cook and clean!<br> - He found you through an ad.<br> - l already know, Mom. Sorry.<br> lt's not your average proposal,<br> but let's face it, -<br> - they're not standing in line<br> for me. And we like each other!<br> Then say yes!<br> l can live alone.<br> lf you think such a marriage<br> is normal, then go ahead.<br> Why do you do that? Why do you<br> make it sound so pathetic?<br> You had a life. A husband who adored<br> you. Can't l have some of that?<br> l'm getting older, too.<br> Why can't you be happy for me?<br> But you can't, can you?<br> You're scared to death of<br> being alone. And you're jealous.<br> Jealous because a man wants me.<br> A good-looking man. How ridiculous!<br> Well, you know something, Mom?<br> A man does.<br> Today, Gregory Larkin and Rose<br> Morgan have exchanged rings -<br> - and agreed to recognise each other<br> as equals.<br> They shall seek a life of<br> kindness and understanding.<br> The ceremony of marriage<br> is a means of establishing a home.<br> And as you have exchanged vows<br> before witnesses, -<br> - by the authority vested in me,<br> l pronounce you husband and wife.<br> - Congratulations! She's a great ...<br> - Yes. l've heard so much about you.<br> - Likewise, about you.<br> - We all ought to ...<br> Had l known you were this handsome,<br> l'd have answered the ad myself.<br> Congratulations. She's the best. lf<br> l were a man, l'd be all over her.<br> Congratulations. l'm sure you'll<br> both be very fascinating to watch.<br> Rose, isn't it amazing how many<br> books you accumulate over the years?<br> - l know what you mean.<br> - l can't believe it. And the dust!<br> - This place needs a good cleaning.<br> - We'll take care of that.<br> l made room for your books.<br> Need any help?<br> Everything's put in its place.<br> - What would you like to do?<br> - Go to bed.<br> To sleep ... ln order to sleep.<br> You go to the bed for sleeping.<br> - Do you want to do something else?<br> - What?<br> - l wasn't going to say anything.<br> - Do you want the bathroom first?<br> - No, l can wait.<br> - No, you go. Please.<br> Your turn.<br> - Tired?<br> - Not really.<br> Me neither.<br> These are nice.<br> - You want to watch some TV?<br> - Sure. l have some old movies.<br> ''lt Happened One Night'', ''Lawrence<br> of Arabia'', ''Now, Voyager''?<br> How about ''Lawrence of Arabia''?<br> lt's nice and long.<br> Okay. ''Lawrence of Arabia'' it is.<br> Just stick it in.<br> - ls it over?<br> - Yeah. Go to sleep.<br> Are you just looking or buying?<br> - l'm not sure yet.<br> - So, it it seems to be going well.<br> - Have you ..?<br> - No, and it's made no difference.<br> - l give you both a lot of credit.<br> - Credit for what?<br> l was just telling Henry<br> how sex isn't an issue for us.<br> lt's much less complicated this way,<br> not to mention sanitary.<br> lt feels so good to be writing<br> again. l have so many ideas!<br> lt's coming so easily.<br> l have outlines for three chapters.<br> What a terrific idea to come here.<br> l've never written in the park.<br> Another one of these ...<br> ls that Barry?<br> l think it is.<br> Barry ...<br> - Hi. lt's Rose.<br> - How are you? This is Gloria.<br> - This is my husband, Gregory.<br> - Hi. This is Gloria.<br> - You got married. Congratulations.<br> - Thank you. You look good, Barry.<br> - Being engaged agrees with me.<br> - Congratulations!<br> - Finally, one who doesn't cancel.<br> - Excuse me. Nice to meet you.<br> - l'm really happy for you both.<br> - Thank you, Rose. And take care.<br> - Everything okay?<br> - Yeah, everything's okay.<br> What?<br> Jeans and a T-shirt is a good look<br> for you. Wear it to class sometime.<br> - l'd love to get the scores.<br> - l'll read the paper.<br> Oh, l didn't tell you ...<br> A few European universities have<br> invited me to lecture on my book.<br> l told them, of course, that l<br> wanted to check with you first.<br> - Sounds great. For how long?<br> - Three months.<br> Three months?<br> - All right, guys, let's get going.<br> - How can baseball fascinate people?<br> You wind up<br> at the same place you started.<br> This should interest you, because<br> it's about stats and averages.<br> When a player comes up, they flash<br> a three-digit number, his average.<br> How many times he hits the ball,<br> in ratio to the number of attempts.<br> Anybody see the game yesterday?<br> Marrakesh, what a bum, huh?<br> Let me try<br> putting this another way.<br> lf a batter hits a ball, how can we<br> determine how far it will go?<br> What variables add up to a home run,<br> assuming the bum could hit one?<br> - The velocity of the ball?<br> - l have a question.<br> Does a rising fastball really rise?<br> l don't know.<br> l'll have to ask my wife.<br> l could not believe it. Suddenly<br> the room was filled with energy.<br> We were exchanging ideas.<br> We were connected somehow.<br> They participated,<br> they questioned, they stayed!<br> l cannot thank you enough. l was<br> a better teacher because of you.<br> - Fresh pepper?<br> - Not for her, but l'll have some.<br> Could you bring her a side dish of<br> dressing? She likes a little extra.<br> l feel l should return the favour.<br> ls there anything l can do for you?<br> l'll have to think about that.<br> Just glop it on.<br> Enjoy your dinner.<br> - You're not eating.<br> - No, l'm watching your ritual.<br> l just about got your sequence now.<br> You start by rotating the plate<br> counterclockwise ...<br> ...cut on the diagonal ...<br> remove unwanted elements ...<br> And now comes my favourite part:<br> The loading of the fork.<br> lt's fascinating, the percentages<br> you use of different vegetables, -<br> - to create that one<br> harmoniously-balanced, perfect bite.<br> You have a little ...<br> Don't smear it.<br> That might stain. You might want to<br> put a little soap on that.<br> l'll be right back.<br> l want to ask you something.<br> - Don't stop.<br> - l'm not a machine.<br> We both have overwhelming feelings<br> for each other, don't we?<br> - You're doing great. Keep it up.<br> - Okay. Ready?<br> - Doesn't that music infuriate you?<br> - Yeah, l'm livid.<br> l came by your office today<br> for lunch, but you weren't there.<br> - Were you at a staff meeting?<br> - l had lunch with Henry.<br> Rose, he's a friend of mine,<br> but you have to watch out for him.<br> - Believe me, l'm not his type.<br> - He can't always control himself.<br> - Did you pull something?<br> - l think so. Right here.<br> A little lower.<br> Lower.<br> Closer to the spine. There.<br> Lean back.<br> l thought you might like to meet me<br> in Europe after your classes end.<br> - We never had a honeymoon.<br> - That's right. l'd love that.<br> Would you?<br> - Am l pressing too hard?<br> - No, but l'm all sweaty.<br> And l have to floss.<br> When you've got to floss,<br> you've got to floss.<br> l don't know how to ask for it.<br> We're so polite, l feel like we're<br> room-mates in a charm school.<br> - l'm putting you on the speaker.<br> - l'm so frustrated, Claire.<br> - Give him an "l want sex" look.<br> - He'll think something's in my eye.<br> - You have to generate heat.<br> - Sometimes, l swear he feels it.<br> Men aren't that bright. lt's easy.<br> Be subtle, mysterious, seductive.<br> Subtle, mysterious, seductive? Why<br> don't men come with instructions?<br> - More coffee?<br> - Thanks. My tickets just arrived.<br> My first lecture is in Paris,<br> on the 24th. l leave Saturday.<br> - Do you want an English muffin?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - l'm off. l have an early class.<br> - All right. Have a nice day.<br> Oh ... would saying now that l want<br> sex tonight be enough of a warning?<br> Or should we wait till you come back<br> from Europe? Yeah, that's better.<br> No, no ...<br> That's fine.<br> All right.<br> l guess l'll see you tonight.<br> Have a nice day.<br> - Have you ever tried making love?<br> - lt's never been about sex.<br> l don't understand. Things were<br> going so well. Sex now will ruin it.<br> You're a very sick man.<br> - l have the game on for you.<br> - Oh, great.<br> - Some wine?<br> - l'll wake up with a headache.<br> - One glass.<br> - All right, one glass.<br> Same score?<br> This is good. Sweet.<br> l normally don't like sweet.<br> l'm glad you like it.<br> Do you ...<br> Would you mind terribly<br> if we muted the TV?<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Nothing ... much.<br> Would it be all right if l sat down?<br> - The wine made me warm.<br> - l can fix that.<br> - Good game?<br> - l can't hear.<br> That's all right.<br> - Did l hurt you?<br> - No, you didn't spill a drop.<br> - l guess ...<br> - That's funny? l guess it's funny.<br> Do you think<br> we could turn the TV off?<br> That's better.<br> - We have to relax.<br> - l agree.<br> - How are classes?<br> - Going well.<br> - And your book?<br> - The outline is actually ...<br> lt's ... lt's coming along.<br> lt's almost there.<br> lt's not at all what l expected.<br> lt's harder than l thought.<br> But l'll ...<br> l'm sure that ... l'll get there.<br> l want you to get there.<br> What did you say?<br> - Rose ...<br> - Talk to me.<br> Oh, yes ... Oh, no ...<br> Oh, God.<br> Oh, Rose.<br> - No, no, no.<br> - Yes, yes, yes.<br> l don't want to do this!<br> l'm sorry, Rose.<br> l have to say, Rose, that l'm a<br> little confused. A bit disappointed.<br> lt was going so well.<br> At least, l thought so. Didn't you?<br> ls that the truth, or some kind of<br> manipulation? Tell me the truth.<br> You knew the agreement, how l felt.<br> Did you think it would change?<br> Why?<br> l hoped, though l made the offer,<br> you'd see there was no need for it.<br> l'd hoped that we'd got beyond it.<br> Did you think<br> this was the next step?<br> What we have usually comes after<br> all this nonsense is over.<br> Most never get to where we are.<br> They try to keep the sex going, -<br> - or find another. Our relationship<br> works because it isn't physical.<br> l took every precaution to make sure<br> there was no physical attraction!<br> Rose, l'm sorry.<br> l've never had this with a woman.<br> l can share everything with you.<br> Are you not satisfied with me?<br> Maybe this is something we have to<br> struggle through together.<br> Maybe this tour is coming at a good<br> time. Maybe we can use the distance.<br> Don't you think?<br> l thought we were good friends.<br> Talk to me, Rose. Let me in.<br> l'm sorry.<br> Open the door.<br> Open the door, please.<br> Come on, Rose.<br> What are you doing here?<br> l just came to sleep in my own bed.<br> ls that okay?<br> What happened? ls it Gregory?<br> l don't want to say l told you so,<br> but ...<br> - Mom.<br> - What?<br> When l was a baby,<br> did you think l was pretty?<br> All babies are pretty.<br> No, l mean me.<br> You must have thought something<br> about how l looked.<br> Oh, what's pretty, anyway?<br> What good did it do your sister?<br> Do you remember<br> when l was a little girl?<br> You told me to push up my nose<br> with my index finger.<br> - So it wouldn't droop.<br> - l did not! Are you drunk?<br> That's what you told me. lt's funny,<br> l never would have thought -<br> - that l wasn't pretty, if it<br> weren't for those things you said.<br> lf you came to say more cruel things<br> to me, l'm going to bed.<br> - Mom ...<br> - What?<br> - How did it feel?<br> - What?<br> Being beautiful?<br> No, l mean it.<br> How did it feel having people<br> look at you with such admiration?<br> Looking at yourself in the mirror<br> with such appreciation?<br> How did that feel?<br> lt was wonderful.<br> l bet.<br> - This is Gregory. ls Rose there?<br> - She's out. Can l take a message?<br> No. l've been giving you messages,<br> and she hasn't called back.<br> - l want to say goodbye to my wife.<br> - l'll tell her.<br> l wanted to say goodbye to you<br> myself, not through your mother.<br> l don't like leaving this way,<br> but my plane is here.<br> l hope your mother<br> doesn't erase this message.<br> l don't know what else to say.<br> l wanted to say goodbye to you<br> myself, not through your mother.<br> - You're up early.<br> - l haven't been to bed.<br> - You haven't been to bed?<br> - No.<br> Why not?<br> l had a lot to think about,<br> after you left.<br> lt's awful to leave a woman my age<br> alone with her thoughts.<br> You really love him, don't you?<br> You do, it's obvious.<br> That feeling ...<br> ... you have for Gregory ...<br> l don't think l ever felt that.<br> Not even for your father.<br> lt's not easy for me to say.<br> Especially to you.<br> lt's awful<br> to look back on your life -<br> - and realise that you've settled.<br> The problem was that l always felt<br> l had more time.<br> l was ...<br> Now, inside, l feel young.<br> Like it's the beginning.<br> Like l have everything ahead of me.<br> But l don't.<br> So l guess l am jealous.<br> Parents don't have a plan<br> to hurt their children.<br> - l never wanted to hurt you.<br> - l'm not that hurt.<br> Do you know what l thought<br> when you were a baby?<br> That you looked just like your dad,<br> and that Claire looked like me.<br> What's that?<br> She was so pretty, even then.<br> Look at those eyes. Those lips.<br> That's not Claire, that's you.<br> Me?<br> l never saw this picture.<br> - l found it when l was cleaning up.<br> - This was me?<br> l was pretty?<br> Your father adored you.<br> But you know that.<br> He never felt that way about Claire.<br> Only you.<br> l don't think he ever held a baby<br> until you came.<br> He never wanted to let you go.<br> - l'm glad you found this.<br> - So am l.<br> She was very pretty.<br> You were very pretty.<br> Remember that.<br> Thank you for your warm welcome.<br> lt's an honour for me to be here.<br> Rose, l'd love to speak with you.<br> l never seem to catch you at home.<br> We should discuss this, Rose. l have<br> no judgement over what happened.<br> l'm leaving for Venice tomorrow<br> and wanted to say happy birthday.<br> l have a present for you.<br> lt's a week at a baseball camp.<br> Hello, Rose?<br> Rose, are you there?<br> - Henry, have you heard from her?<br> - She cancelled her summer classes.<br> - How do you know that?<br> - l called her mother.<br> - Rose, try this one. lt's an eight.<br> - l like the black one, in a six.<br> Rose, l can't believe how childishly<br> you're behaving. lt's unlike you.<br> - How did she finally persuade you?<br> - lt's a long story.<br> l'm changing my plans.<br> l'll be in New York on Monday.<br> My number here is:<br> All prime numbers, by the way.<br> Hello?<br> Rose?<br> Are you there?<br> - Rose?<br> - l'll be right out.<br> May l have a glass, too?<br> Good to see you, Greg.<br> How was your trip?<br> Are you all right?<br> - Travelling doesn't agree with me.<br> - You need a glass of water?<br> - What happened to you?<br> - l just made a few changes.<br> - What did you do to your hair?<br> - l lightened it.<br> - And you're wearing make-up.<br> - Women do that from time to time.<br> lt's not like l had surgery,<br> although my mother offered.<br> - Are you hungry?<br> - You never wore make-up.<br> l know. The no-frills girl.<br> Like l said, l made some changes.<br> And you lost weight.<br> These have no oil or butter.<br> You just have to get used to it.<br> - What have you done?<br> - l put on make-up and lost weight.<br> You don't return my calls, you<br> completely cut me off, then this ...<br> l'm ... speechless.<br> - l guess you don't like it.<br> - Don't like it? l'm in shock.<br> l come home to find a completely<br> different woman. Why did you do it?<br> Why do l have to explain this?<br> l'm your husband. And l married<br> a woman who looked a certain way.<br> - l feel sort of betrayed.<br> - Oh, please!<br> You had no right.<br> Why did you do this to me?<br> Do what to you? What does it matter<br> how l look? You never look at me.<br> lf appearance doesn't matter,<br> what's wrong with this appearance?<br> Sorry if it upsets<br> your mathematical equation.<br> ''Handsome, frightened man marries<br> unattractive, desperate woman.''<br> l was simply expecting someone else.<br> l'll just have to get used to it.<br> - You don't have to get used to it.<br> - What do you mean?<br> l don't want to continue.<br> l don't understand.<br> l apologize. l settled<br> for something that l didn't want.<br> l thought l could live with that.<br> But l lied, to myself and to you.<br> To be honest, l think your theory<br> about relationships is bullshit.<br> l believe in love, lust, sex and<br> romance, not in a perfect equation.<br> l want mess and chaos. l want<br> someone to go crazy for me.<br> l want passion and heat and sweat<br> and madness! Valentines and cupids!<br> l want it all,<br> and l want to thank you, -<br> - because you forced me to look at<br> things l was too scared to look at.<br> lmagine, all this time l kept up<br> this ridiculous fantasy -<br> - that you, like Alex, would fall in<br> love with me. lt was wrong of me.<br> - But l think ...<br> - l know. Just let me finish.<br> - l feel ...<br> - Strongly about your beliefs. Fine.<br> l'm sorry l broke the agreement,<br> but l fell in love with you.<br> But it's all right now, because<br> l'm not in love with you any more.<br> What?<br> Which now makes me perfect for this,<br> but now l don't want this marriage.<br> Suddenly dinner doesn't seem like<br> such a good idea.<br> l should go.<br> - Are you going to your mother's?<br> - Just until l find my own place.<br> l hope at some point we can pick up<br> where we left off, as friends.<br> Thanks. You're the first man who<br> wanted to marry me, for any reason.<br> Can l call you tomorrow?<br> What for?<br> You all have copies of the syllabus?<br> There will be four short papers.<br> Be prepared to also discuss these<br> in class.<br> Some of my students from last term<br> can tell you how important ...<br> What?<br> Yes, l have breasts. They cannot,<br> however, be the subject for a paper.<br> A double play!<br> l miss her, but l'm proud<br> that l stood up for what l believe.<br> lt could have worked. Not with her,<br> but it was an invaluable experience.<br> You're in bad shape, aren't you?<br> May l make a suggestion?<br> Put all your valuable possessions<br> in storage.<br> - Why?<br> - So you won't break anything.<br> l just told you, l'm fine. l'm using<br> all of this in my next book.<br> Especially glass.<br> l miss him, Claire.<br> But l don't think he's ready for me.<br> l still can't get used to seeing you<br> like this. lt's sort of unnerving.<br> You're just like the rest of us now.<br> Now you'll spend an hour in front of<br> the mirror, every morning and night.<br> Now you'll be scanning for who looks<br> better than you and who doesn't.<br> As the years go by,<br> the numbers change, -<br> - until you walk into a room and<br> you're the last one any man notices.<br> Rose?<br> My God! Rose!<br> - Hi, Alex.<br> - l can't believe it's you.<br> - Alex, get a fucking grip.<br> - You look incredible. Doesn't she?<br> Yes, we already covered that.<br> l thought you hated salad.<br> l can't eat a cheeseburger<br> in the middle of the day any more.<br> - Doesn't it bloat you?<br> - No.<br> l thought it went well with<br> the spareribs l had for breakfast.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - l'm sorry.<br> l always thought we'd be in the<br> same boat. lt made it easier.<br> l'll tell you what.<br> l'll give you half my salad if you<br> give me half your burger.<br> - We'll need some more dressing.<br> - Definitely. Waiter!<br> We all want to be attractive.<br> But remember:<br> One of the first things<br> people notice is your smile.<br> Your appearance is probably<br> important to you.<br> We spend so much time, energy and<br> money in an effort to look good.<br> We all want to be attractive.<br> Hello, it's Alex.<br> - How are you?<br> - l'm trying to get on with my life.<br> - What's wrong with you?<br> - Claire's gone.<br> l came home to surprise her at lunch<br> and found her with her masseur.<br> lt's my own fault.<br> Claire hates surprises.<br> - Alex, l'm really sorry.<br> - l don't know why she wasn't happy.<br> - l couldn't have loved her more.<br> - lt wouldn't have mattered.<br> - Claire was jealous of you.<br> - Jealous of me?<br> She got so mad<br> every time l'd talk about you.<br> She thought l had a crush on you.<br> Maybe she was right.<br> Do you want to have dinner with me?<br> l'm asking you to dinner.<br> l have to think about it.<br> l'll have to ask Claire.<br> - D! You're improving!<br> - l don't understand twin primes.<br> l'm explaining it!<br> An infinite set minus an infinite<br> number leaves an infinite number.<br> We spent time on this! My wife<br> understood it on our first date!<br> Class dismissed!<br> Get out of here! Go!<br> Very enjoyable dinner.<br> - Did you cook it yourself?<br> - Yes, l did.<br> - What a liar.<br> - Yes, l am.<br> What?<br> l only smoke when l'm with you.<br> l wonder why?<br> l can't thank you enough<br> for the other day. For tonight.<br> You're such an inspiration.<br> The way you've changed ...<br> ... evolved, l guess,<br> is a better word, -<br> - into this beautiful ... smart ...<br> ... very sexy ...<br> l must have loved you all along.<br> l just didn't know it.<br> What an idiot.<br> Hannah, this is ridiculous.<br> She can't not talk to me forever.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - l have to explain things.<br> - lt's a little late for that.<br> - No, l don't think so.<br> What Rose and l have goes far beyond<br> what normal people ...<br> What's all that noise? What are you<br> trying to say? What is going on?<br> - Put her on the damn phone now!<br> - She's not here.<br> l might as well tell you,<br> she's with Alex now.<br> She's with him now. You know<br> how much she's always cared for him.<br> So l see no point in you<br> pursuing this any further.<br> l'm sorry to keep you waiting. So,<br> Mr. Jenkins, which do you like best?<br> To be perfectly honest,<br> l think you're more beautiful now.<br> Good answer.<br> What did you mean by, you must<br> have loved me but didn't know it?<br> - l'd like an answer.<br> - You were different then.<br> - How could you have loved me then?<br> - l loved you for who you were.<br> So now you want who l am<br> because l'm not who l was any more?<br> Rose, what?<br> l have dreamt about this moment<br> from the first day we met.<br> l've played out what you'd say and<br> what you'd think a million times.<br> - But you were better in my head.<br> - Maybe l've had too much to drink.<br> lt's not you, it's me. l don't<br> feel anything. lsn't that great?<br> l never thought about my feelings,<br> only yours.<br> - l didn't think l was good enough.<br> - Oh, but you are!<br> l know. But Alex,<br> you're not good enough for me.<br> She's with Alex now, Henry.<br> l don't know if it's my head<br> or my stomach.<br> l might have Chinese food poisoning.<br> Maybe my Szechwan chicken was a cat.<br> l'm so dizzy.<br> l was all alone,<br> and l didn't know what to do.<br> - l'm sorry, Henry.<br> - You'll just stay here tonight.<br> Henry, l love Rose.<br> The old Rose. The one with no<br> make-up who loves the perfect bite.<br> l love her. lt's real.<br> lt's not based on passion, -<br> - although l feel that. Or lust,<br> although l feel that.<br> Or even physical attraction. She ...<br> Though l thought she was beautiful.<br> Her eyes, her mouth. The way she<br> held herself, made fun of herself.<br> She eats carrots now.<br> lsn't that tragic?<br> What am l going to do?<br> ln the last two years<br> l've been with 11 different women.<br> Most of them half my age. Not one<br> with a sense of humour l understood.<br> l don't do it because they're smart.<br> l gave one ''A Farewell to Arms'', -<br> - and she thought<br> it was a diet book.<br> - Can l help you?<br> - Yes, l want to see Miss Morgan.<br> lt's kind of late to visit. l don't<br> think she'd want to be disturbed.<br> l believe ... l know her<br> a lot better than you do.<br> Rose!<br> Do you hear that?<br> What the hell is going on?<br> - lt's him, isn't it?<br> - Gregory!<br> Oh, God!<br> l can't believe this.<br> - What is he doing out there?<br> - l'm going to find out.<br> - He's insane.<br> - l know. lsn't it wonderful?<br> Get the hell out of here!<br> People are trying to sleep.<br> You had enough?<br> - Stop!<br> - l'll call the police.<br> - No, this is my husband.<br> - He doesn't have a key?<br> l said l knew her better than you.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - l came to see you.<br> Why did you come to see me?<br> ln light of our last conversation,<br> and after speaking with Henry ...<br> ... although you might have serious<br> reservations about considering ...<br> Gregory, l'm aging here.<br> What is it you want to say?<br> God, you're beautiful.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, Gregory.<br> What?<br> l'm so sorry for the way l acted<br> and the things l said.<br> l know that l hurt you.<br> That was the last thing l ...<br> - l accept your apology.<br> - Let me finish. This is important.<br> That night ...<br> That terrible night ...<br> l wanted you so much,<br> l couldn't see straight.<br> l have to make sure you know that.<br> lt wasn't you.<br> You're a very sexy girl.<br> l know it's unfair of me to say so,<br> now you're with Alex.<br> - Who said l was with Alex?<br> - Your mother.<br> My mother? Oh, great.<br> - l'm not with Alex.<br> - You're not?<br> - Well ...<br> - Talk to me.<br> Rose ... l love you.<br> And l want to be married to you.<br> Gregory, you are married to me.<br> That's right. Yeah, right.<br> - l'm getting a little dizzy.<br> - lt'll pass. Just hold on.<br> - Rose, don't ever leave me again.<br> - l'm not leaving you. l love you.<br> l couldn't stand<br> being away from you.<br> l don't care if you are pretty.<br> l love you anyway.<br> Everything will drop as l get older,<br> and l'm gaining weight as we speak.<br> That's comforting.<br> - Get in, lady.<br> - Oh no, not you again!<br> - Your windows are still broke?<br> - Complain to the cab company.<br>
