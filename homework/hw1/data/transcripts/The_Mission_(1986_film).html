                        Your Holiness, the little matter<br> that brought me here is now settled.<br> The Indians are once more free to be enslaved<br> by the Spanish and Portuguese settlers.<br> I don't think that's hitting<br> the right note. Begin again.<br> Your Holiness, I write to you<br> in this year of our Lord 1758...<br> ...from the southern continent of the<br> Americas, from the town of Asuncin...<br> ...two weeks' march from<br> the great mission of San Miguel.<br> These missions have protected the Indians<br> from the depredations of the settlers...<br> ... and have earned much resentment<br> because of it.<br> The noble souls of these Indians<br> incline towards music.<br> Indeed, many a violin played<br> in the academies of Rome...<br> ... have been made<br> by their nimble and gifted hands.<br> It was from these missions the Jesuit<br> fathers carried the word of God...<br> ... to those Indians still<br> existing in their natural state...<br> ... and received in return, martyrdom.<br> The death of this priest<br> was to form the first link...<br> ... in the chain of which<br> I now find myself a part.<br> Continue.<br> As Your Holiness undoubtedly knows...<br> ...little in this world<br> unfolds as we predict.<br> How could the Indians have supposed<br> that the death of that unsung priest...<br> ... would bring among them a man whose life<br> was to become intertwined with their own?<br> Thank you, Father.<br> It was our territory.<br> Julien's and mine.<br> I sent him, Father.<br> I have to go up there myself.<br> Can you see him?<br> No.<br> With an orchestra, the Jesuits could<br> have subdued the whole continent.<br> So it was that the Guarani<br> were brought finally to account...<br> ... to the everlasting mercy of God...<br> ... and to the short-lived<br> mercy of man.<br> Who are you?<br> So you're hunting above the falls now,<br> Captain Mendoza?<br> We're building a mission here.<br> - We'll make Christians of these people.<br> - Lf you have the time.<br> It's your brother.<br> - Alonzo, are they healthy?<br> - Excellent.<br> Good.<br> - Are there many above the falls?<br> - Yes.<br> - Dangerous?<br> - Yes.<br> - Not against powder and shot.<br> - No.<br> I've seen Jesuits there.<br> - Above the falls?<br> - Yes.<br> Damn them.<br> The mission is<br> to be called San Carlos.<br> - Don Cabeza.<br> - Mendoza.<br> Take them away.<br> Quickly. Quickly now.<br> - You should find yourself a good woman.<br> - I have.<br> If you had,<br> you wouldn't look so gloomy.<br> - Maybe you're right.<br> - About women, I'm always right.<br> - How could I forget?<br> - You forget everything.<br> - I do, do I?<br> - You do.<br> Good.<br> Hello.<br> - Good. Now take them off.<br> - Excellent.<br> You distract too easily.<br> On the day the seorita<br> can't distract my attention...<br> ...I'll become a monk.<br> - On that day, Felipe...<br> ...half the ladies in this town<br> will become nuns.<br> Pure gossip.<br> Rodrigo is the lady's man.<br> Rodrigo here is this lady's man.<br> Felipe?<br> I love him, Rodrigo.<br> Since when have you loved Felipe?<br> Six months.<br> - Six...?<br> - I've been trying to tell you.<br> I have.<br> Yes, yes, yes, yes.<br> You have been trying to tell me.<br> So me you do not love?<br> Not as I love Felipe.<br> - Rodrigo, that's the love that I need.<br> - I see.<br> And so I have no need?<br> You need so much.<br> You deserve so much.<br> Rodrigo, you won't hurt him, will you?<br> No, I won't hurt him.<br> Rodrigo, please.<br> - You laughed.<br> - I did not laugh.<br> Most certainly you laughed.<br> - At whom are you laughing?<br> - Don't do this.<br> Quarrel with me!<br> Oh, no!<br> So how goes it at your mission<br> above the falls?<br> - Insects and twigs, Father.<br> - No converts?<br> A few.<br> - And many near to it, thank the Lord.<br> - Thank the Lord, indeed.<br> - Do you know Rodrigo Mendoza?<br> - Yes, I know him.<br> Come with me.<br> I have a task, and you are<br> the only one who can do it.<br> He's been here for six months,<br> but he won't see anybody.<br> I think he wants to die.<br> So...<br> ...you killed your brother.<br> And it was a duel.<br> And the law can't touch you.<br> Is this remorse?<br> Leave...<br> ...priest.<br> Maybe you wish I was your executioner.<br> Perhaps that would be easier.<br> Leave me alone.<br> - You know what I am.<br> - Yes.<br> You're a mercenary,<br> you're a slave trader...<br> ...and you killed your brother.<br> I know.<br> And you loved him.<br> Although you chose<br> a strange way to show it.<br> Are you laughing at me?<br> Are you laughing at me?<br> I'm laughing at you...<br> ...because all I see is laughable.<br> I see a man running away, a man<br> hiding from the world. I see a coward.<br> Go on.<br> Go on.<br> So is that it?<br> Is this how you mean to go on?<br> - There is nothing else.<br> - There is life.<br> - There is no life.<br> - There is a way out, Mendoza.<br> For me, there is no redemption.<br> God gave us the burden of freedom.<br> You chose your crime.<br> Do you have the courage to choose<br> your penance? Do you dare do that?<br> There is no penance<br> hard enough for me.<br> - But do you dare try it?<br> - Do I dare?<br> Do you dare to see it fail?<br> - Father?<br> - Aye?<br> How long must he carry<br> that stupid thing?<br> God knows, Father John.<br> - Ralph, here.<br> - Thank you.<br> Father?<br> He's done this penance long enough, and,<br> well, the other brothers think the same.<br> But he doesn't think so, John.<br> Until he does, neither do I.<br> We're not the members of a democracy,<br> Father. We're members of an order.<br> No.<br> No.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, Lord, for our food<br> and all your other blessings. Amen.<br> Oh, good Lord.<br> - Did you cook this?<br> - Yes.<br> Did you put in all the chilies?<br> Lm afraid I did.<br> Lm sorry. I was trained<br> as a mercenary, not as a cook.<br> - This is true.<br> - Its dreadful.<br> - But the bread is good.<br> - Its not bad.<br> Father, I want to thank you<br> for having me here.<br> You should thank the Guarani.<br> How?<br> Read this.<br> "Though I have all faith<br> so that I could remove mountains...<br> ... and have not love, I am nothing.<br> And though I bestow all my goods<br> to feed the poor...<br> ... and though I give my body<br> to be burned...<br> ... and have not love,<br> it profiteth me nothing.<br> Love suffereth long and is kind.<br> Love envieth not.<br> Love vaunteth not itself,<br> is not puffed up.<br> When I was a child,<br> I spake as a child...<br> ... I understood as a child,<br> I thought as a child.<br> But when I became a man,<br> I put away childish things.<br> But now abideth faith, hope, love...<br> These three.<br> But the greatest of these is love. "<br> They've agreed.<br> If you're going to become a Jesuit,<br> you must accept my orders...<br> ...as if they were the orders<br> of a commander. Can you do that?<br> Yes, Father.<br> Let us pray for our brother Rodrigo.<br> Christ, you led Father Ignatius to<br> renounce the snares of this world...<br> ...and to put on the livery<br> of labor and humiliation.<br> Now we ask your blessing on Rodrigo<br> as we welcome him into our community.<br> Teach him to be generous,<br> to labor and not to count the cost...<br> ...to serve with no reward,<br> save the doing of your will.<br> Amen.<br> Welcome home, brother.<br> This seeking to create<br> a paradise on earth...<br> ... how easily it offends.<br> Your Holiness is offended...<br> ... because it may distract from<br> that paradise which comes hereafter.<br> The Spanish and Portuguese kings<br> are offended...<br> ... because a paradise of the poor<br> is seldom pleasing to those who rule.<br> And the settlers here are offended<br> for the same reason.<br> So it was this burden I carried<br> to South America:<br> To satisfy the Portuguese wish<br> to enlarge their empire...<br> ... to satisfy the Spanish desire that<br> this would do them no harm...<br> ... to satisfy Your Holiness...<br> ... that these monarchs would threaten<br> no more the power of the church...<br> ... and to ensure for you all...<br> ... that the Jesuits here could no longer<br> deny you these satisfactions.<br> Lve spent half my life<br> waiting for Rome.<br> Stop playing with that.<br> - What time is it?<br> - Calm down.<br> Ten to.<br> Let me see how the children are doing.<br> Good.<br> Twenty-four.<br> Thirty-nine.<br> Over there, please.<br> - Those are Guarani?<br> - Yes, Your Eminence.<br> - Extraordinary.<br> - What?<br> Very difficult to tell<br> what they're thinking.<br> - Have you found this, Seor Hontar?<br> - I have.<br> I had that reaction when I first came,<br> Your Eminence.<br> Pretty creature.<br> She'll fetch a lot of money in Lisbon.<br> Yes. Well, perhaps<br> she doesn't want to go to Lisbon.<br> Perhaps not.<br> Well, Your Eminence,<br> as to the missions...<br> We expect no political difference between<br> the Papacy and Spain and Portugal?<br> Why should there be?<br> Between ourselves, Your Eminence,<br> the Jesuits are too powerful here.<br> Indeed?<br> - Well, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen...<br> - Your Eminence.<br> By the way, gentlemen...<br> ...I myself was a Jesuit once.<br> So I had arrived in South America, my<br> head replete with the matters of Europe.<br> But I soon began to understand,<br> for the first time...<br> ... what a strange world<br> I had been sent to judge.<br> Don Cabeza, how can you possibly<br> refer to this child as an animal?<br> A parrot can be taught to sing,<br> Your Eminence.<br> Yes, but how does one teach it<br> to sing as melodiously as this?<br> Your Eminence.<br> This is a child of the jungle,<br> an animal with a human voice.<br> If it were human,<br> an animal would cringe at its vices.<br> These creatures<br> are lethal and lecherous.<br> They have to be subdued by the sword<br> and brought to labor by the whip.<br> What they say is sheer nonsense.<br> Father Gabriel, of the mission of<br> San Carlos, from which the boy comes.<br> And that is where?<br> That is here.<br> Above the falls, in Spanish territory.<br> No, that is territory which used<br> to be Spanish. Now it's Portuguese.<br> - That is for His Eminence to decide.<br> - No, that is a state matter.<br> It was decided by the Treaty of Madrid<br> and concluded by Spain and Portugal.<br> But surely the missions will remain<br> under church protection?<br> That is what His Eminence<br> is here to decide, Father Gabriel.<br> Continue, Father.<br> Your Eminence, below the falls,<br> the jungle, if it has to be divided...<br> ...may be divided between<br> the Spanish and Portuguese.<br> But above the falls, it still<br> belongs to God and the Guarani.<br> There's no one else there.<br> And they are not naturally animals.<br> - They're naturally spiritual.<br> - Spiritual?<br> - They kill their own young.<br> - That is true. May I answer that?<br> Every man and woman is allowed<br> one child. If a third is born, it is killed.<br> But this is not some animal rite.<br> Its a necessity for survival.<br> They can only run<br> with one child apiece.<br> And what do they run from?<br> They run from us.<br> - That is, they run from slavery.<br> - Rubbish.<br> - It is well-known...<br> - Rubbish. Your Eminence?<br> Your Eminence?<br> Rubbish. Rubbish.<br> Silence.<br> In the territories covered by Spain,<br> there is no slavery.<br> That institution is permitted<br> in the territories of our neighbors...<br> ...the Portuguese, and is, to my mind,<br> much misunderstood.<br> But here, in Spanish territory...<br> ...we run our plantation in accordance<br> with the laws of Spain...<br> ...and the precepts of the church.<br> That is a lie.<br> That is a lie!<br> I cannot and will not<br> accept a challenge from a monk.<br> - His cloth protects him.<br> - My cloth protects you.<br> In the name of the king,<br> I demand an apology!<br> I want an apology now!<br> Damn you, I won't stand for this!<br> Your Eminence, we've just seen<br> a good example of Jesuit contempt...<br> ...for the authority of the state.<br> Member of your community,<br> Father Gabriel?<br> Yes.<br> Come.<br> - That was perfect.<br> - What?<br> A flash of Jesuit temper was just<br> what we needed him to see.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Be patient, will you?<br> All we need is a little patience.<br> He knows what to do.<br> - You will apologize to Don Cabeza.<br> - What he said was a lie.<br> Silence. You will apologize. Go now.<br> - What was he before he joined you?<br> - A mercenary and a slave trader.<br> - Will he apologize?<br> - Yes, he will.<br> You should know that the Spanish<br> do have slaves here.<br> They buy them from the Portuguese,<br> amongst others.<br> - And Don Cabeza connives at this?<br> - Yes.<br> Profits by it too.<br> Don Cabeza wants the mission territories<br> to be taken over by the Portuguese. Why?<br> Because the missions are the<br> only sanctuary left for the Guarani.<br> Without the shelter we provide<br> under Spanish law...<br> ...the Indians have no protection<br> against slavery.<br> They come to us of their own free will.<br> - Truly?<br> - Ask them. Ask the Guarani.<br> Nine-tenths of what they earn goes back<br> into the community, into their lives.<br> Father Gabriel, what do you think<br> is at issue here?<br> - The work of God is at issue.<br> - No, what is at issue...<br> ...is the very existence of the<br> Jesuit order, both here and in Europe.<br> And I assure you that<br> the courts of Europe are a jungle...<br> ...in comparison with which<br> your jungle here is a tidy garden.<br> But is that to stand in our way?<br> Thank you.<br> - But why must I apologize? Why?<br> - Because I order it.<br> - It was a lie.<br> - Nevertheless, I order it.<br> Don Cabeza hates Jesuits and Indians.<br> He and the Portuguese are ruthless.<br> - Can't you see that?<br> - Of course.<br> - Then why must I apologize?<br> - What better excuse can we give them...<br> ...but that one of our order, albeit a<br> novice, publicly insults one of them?<br> Now, you will apologize.<br> Or are you no longer a Jesuit?<br> By order of holy obedience,<br> without reservation...<br> ...I ask Don Cabeza to pardon<br> my presumption and my insolence.<br> Well, I accept.<br> Why not?<br> But as I said before, I cannot accept<br> a challenge from a priest.<br> True, which makes my insolence<br> all the more insolent...<br> ...and your pardon twice as gracious.<br> Your Eminence, I ask your pardon too.<br> I ask the pardon of this assembly.<br> I ask for the pardon of my brothers.<br> And I ask for your pardon...<br> ...for insulting His Excellency.<br> - Thank you, that will do.<br> Well, that was most gratifying,<br> Your Eminence.<br> Do you think you could tell us about<br> your attitude to the transference...<br> ...of the missions' territories?<br> - Precisely.<br> I have kept these matters in the front<br> of my mind ever since I came here.<br> But I do not think<br> I should make a final decision...<br> ...until I have seen these mission<br> territories with my own eyes.<br> There are numerous missions<br> that I should inspect.<br> But I have decided that<br> I shall begin with the oldest...<br> ... the great mission of San Miguel.<br> Your Holiness, a surgeon,<br> to save the body...<br> ... must often hack off a limb.<br> But, in truth, nothing had prepared me<br> for the beauty and the power...<br> ... of the limb that I<br> had come here to sever.<br> - Very impressive.<br> - Perhaps lm missing something.<br> I can't see any difference<br> between this plantation and my own.<br> That is the difference.<br> This plantation is theirs.<br> This is another difference.<br> A runaway slave. Bought by<br> a Spanish settler from a slave trader.<br> I see. Is that lawful?<br> Supply and demand is the law of trade.<br> - And the law of souls?<br> - What's a few cuts on the back...<br> ...compared with what you offer them?<br> Torments of hell? Imprisoned souls?<br> Think of that, Your Eminence.<br> Father Ibaye, shall we continue?<br> What was your income last year?<br> Last year, 120,000 escudos.<br> And how was it distributed?<br> It is shared among them equally.<br> This is a community.<br> Yes, there is a French radical group<br> that teaches that doctrine.<br> Your Eminence, it was the doctrine<br> of the early Christians.<br> Well, I am inexpressibly impressed<br> by your achievement, Father.<br> - And will that save us?<br> - I hope it may, Father.<br> The court of Portugal is atheistic,<br> but you and I are Christian Catholics.<br> - And you serve a Christian king.<br> - Come, I also serve a Catholic king.<br> You serve the Marquis of Pombal,<br> who is hostile to the church...<br> ...and rules your king.<br> I suggest we advise your king to postpone<br> the transfer of the mission territories...<br> ...until Portugal guarantees<br> their survival.<br> And I suggest we do this<br> in the hope of heaven...<br> ...through the intercession<br> of our merciful Redeemer.<br> In my opinion, the work of the<br> missions is the work of the devil.<br> They teach contempt for lawful profit,<br> and they disobey the king's authority.<br> The paramount vow of a Jesuit<br> is a vow of obedience.<br> Then let them obey.<br> Tell them, Your Eminence.<br> Am I disturbing you?<br> I fear I have bad tidings<br> from the Marquis of Pombal.<br> Between ourselves, I should like<br> to express my personal regret.<br> He is determined to destroy<br> the power of the church.<br> And your Christian community<br> is commercially competitive.<br> Yes. Its very prosperous.<br> Isn't that precisely why<br> you want to take it over?<br> You should've achieved a noble failure<br> if you wanted the state's approval.<br> There's nothing we like better<br> than a noble failure.<br> Its deeply reassuring<br> to a trading nation such as my own.<br> You're not going to read it?<br> I don't need to read it<br> to know what it contains.<br> So, what will you do?<br> As my conscience dictates.<br> What else?<br> He's been in there five hours.<br> Come with me to my mission<br> in San Carlos.<br> There are so many distractions here.<br> Its hard to see anything clearly.<br> I think that, there, your prayers<br> might meet with better fortune.<br> I think, there, God would tell you<br> what it would be good to do.<br> And he'd give you the strength<br> and the grace to do it...<br> ...whatever it costs you.<br> The Garden of Eden.<br> Its a trifle overgrown.<br> Though I knew, in Europe, states were<br> tearing at the authority of the church...<br> ... and though I knew that to<br> preserve itself there...<br> ... the church must show<br> its authority over the Jesuits here...<br> ... I had to wonder whether these<br> Indians would not have preferred...<br> ... that the sea and wind<br> had not brought any of us to them.<br> They say they don't understand<br> what you mean.<br> They want you to speak more clearly.<br> What do you want them to do?<br> They must leave the mission.<br> They say the mission is their home.<br> They must learn to submit<br> to the will of God.<br> Tell them.<br> They say it was the will of God...<br> ...that they left the jungle<br> and built the mission.<br> They don't understand<br> why God has changed his mind.<br> I cannot hope<br> to understand God's reasons.<br> He says, how does he know<br> you know God's will?<br> He thinks you speak not for God,<br> but for Portugal.<br> I do not personally speak for God,<br> but I speak for the church...<br> ...which is God's instrument on earth.<br> - He says, speak to the king of Portugal.<br> - I have. He will not listen.<br> He said he is also a king.<br> He also will not listen.<br> He says they were wrong<br> ever to have trusted us.<br> - They're going to fight.<br> - You must persuade them not to fight.<br> I have failed to persuade you<br> to fight on their behalf.<br> If they do fight, it is absolutely<br> imperative that no one of you...<br> ...should even seemed<br> to have encouraged them to do so.<br> And therefore, all of you will return<br> with me to Asuncin tomorrow.<br> If anyone should disobey this,<br> he will be excommunicated.<br> Cut off. Cast out.<br> Why must they fight?<br> - Why can't they return to the jungle?<br> - Because this is their home.<br> Did you know this was going<br> to be your decision?<br> - Yes.<br> - Then why did you come, Your Eminence?<br> To persuade you not to resist the<br> transfer of the mission territories.<br> If the Jesuits<br> resist the Portuguese...<br> ...the Jesuit order<br> will be expelled from Portugal.<br> And if Portugal, then Spain,<br> France, Italy... Who knows?<br> If your order is to survive at all...<br> ...the missions here<br> must be sacrificed.<br> What were they saying?<br> They said the devil<br> lives in the forest.<br> - They want to stay here.<br> - And what did you say?<br> I said ld stay with them.<br> I want to renounce<br> my vows of obedience.<br> Get out.<br> - I want to explain...<br> - Get out. I won't listen to you.<br> Just you?<br> No. Its Ralph and John too.<br> What do you want, captain,<br> an honorable death?<br> They want to live, Father.<br> They say that God has left them,<br> he's deserted them.<br> Has he?<br> - You shouldn't have become a priest.<br> - But I am, and they need me.<br> Then help them as a priest!<br> If you die with blood on your hands,<br> you betray everything we've done.<br> You promised your life to God.<br> And God is love!<br> Weren't you supposed<br> to be on guard last night?<br> Look what happened!<br> Get back there with the others.<br> They've taken three guns,<br> gunpowder, pistols...<br> ...and I don't know what else.<br> Father, lve come<br> to ask you to bless me.<br> No.<br> If you're right,<br> you'll have God's blessing.<br> If you're wrong,<br> my blessing won't mean anything.<br> If might is right...<br> ...then love has no place<br> in the world.<br> It may be so.<br> But I don't have the strength<br> to live in a world like that.<br> I can't bless you.<br> Down there. Down there.<br> Bring up both cannons.<br> Quickly. Quickly.<br> The other cannon as well.<br> Indians! Turn around!<br> Turn around! Face them!<br> Fire!<br> We'll have to move the cannon.<br> Move this cannon. Move it.<br> And that one.<br> Over there. Shoot the priest.<br> Get him!<br> - None of us wants to do this.<br> - Lm not interested. Get in position.<br> Row.<br> After him! Faster!<br> Don't let the priest get away!<br> After him!<br> Look out! The falls! Halt!<br> Back! Back! Halt!<br> Go back!<br> And you have the effrontery to tell me<br> that this slaughter was necessary?<br> I did what I had to do.<br> Given the legitimate purpose,<br> which you sanctioned...<br> ...I would have to say, yes.<br> In truth, yes.<br> You had no alternative, Your Eminence.<br> We must work in the world.<br> The world is thus.<br> No, Seor Hontar...<br> ...thus have we made the world.<br> Thus have I made it.<br> So, Your Holiness...<br> ... now your priests are dead,<br> and I am left alive.<br> But, in truth, it is I who am dead,<br> and they who live.<br> For, as always, Your Holiness...<br> ... the spirit of the dead<br> will survive...<br> ... in the memory of the living.<br> subtitle by PINOYPIRATE<br>
