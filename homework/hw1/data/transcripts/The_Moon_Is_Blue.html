It saves time.<br> We always know sooner or later.<br> Did you?<br> Actually, no.<br> - So much the better. I'm happy.<br> Why do not you?<br> You are not obliged to answer.<br> I think maybe<br> it's posh to have a mistress<br> when you do not feel very.<br> It is very fair.<br> And Cynthia ...?<br> - It was not my mistress.<br> I did not say that.<br> - You were going to say.<br> You're really<br> any more engaged?<br> Any more.<br> She is very cute.<br> It has a nice chin.<br> Home, everything is nice.<br> - So she was your mistress!<br> No, nothing of the sort!<br> If you say<br> that everything is beautiful in it is ...<br> Sex great concern to you.<br> Me?<br> - Yes, you.<br> You really believe that?<br> You ask<br> if you want to seduce you,<br> if you like virgins,<br> if you have a mistress.<br> If sex does not concern you ...<br> That may be true.<br> But it is better than I am<br> qu'occupe concerned with sex.<br> Now that you actually two.<br> It started to rain.<br> When you broke up with Cynthia?<br> It happened last night or this morning.<br> Between.<br> That is why<br> she wrote "bastard"?<br> You did not believe in the right?<br> - Not for a second.<br> It makes you much trouble?<br> - You think so?<br> I asked you if you loved<br> and yet you hesitated.<br> She has left a void in my heart.<br> - Why did you break up?<br> You ask too many questions.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It is not by indiscretion.<br> I am interested in people.<br> My God!<br> What time is it?<br> - My sketch has spent 20h.<br> A TV?<br> - I turned veiled weeks.<br> What a pity!<br> - Too bad. He returns at midnight.<br> We look.<br> - No. I'll be in my bed.<br> But look at it.<br> Midnight, the 4th string.<br> Now go to dinner.<br> - Okay. Let's go.<br> You will be soaked<br> not waterproof.<br> Do not go. Dine here.<br> I am good cooker.<br> But I do not<br> excellent food!<br> You something.<br> Would that remains?<br> I focus very much remains.<br> Like the marineau?<br> - Excuse me?<br> Based on herring fillets.<br> Did you?<br> - I would not want to have.<br> Do not say that.<br> It is delicious.<br> The only thing<br> vaguely edible here<br> this is cheese<br> I was sent a Christmas.<br> It's blue!<br> - It turns blue.<br> You never eat here?<br> Not surprising<br> you are unhappy!<br> I'm not at all unhappy.<br> How sad!<br> Love this kitchen unused<br> and this beautiful glacier<br> and the oven.<br> And mill<br> nobody uses.<br> It is a cry.<br> You are the strangest girl<br> I know.<br> You know me hardly.<br> - It does not mean anything ...<br> I think we would do well<br> not to mention both.<br> Why?<br> Because it should not.<br> That's all.<br> Why?<br> In case you have a crush<br> to one another.<br> It would be boring?<br> Yes, having approached me, you<br> always wondering questions.<br> How about?<br> About those who could<br> accost me before you, as you.<br> I am already asked.<br> It happens to you often?<br> Once and doubt intrudes.<br> - My doubts were dispelled.<br> Doubts may dissipate<br> but they come back.<br> You built?<br> No. I want to build one day.<br> This is just one project.<br> Charming. But you will not find<br> ever such trees.<br> They exist. I field.<br> One day I will build the hut.<br> The room?<br> Three windows. A large fireplace<br> or you can do a roast beef.<br> In a room, it would be funny.<br> Branch of the oak<br> be 60 cm from the balcony.<br> If I had such a tree,<br> I live it.<br> When I was a kid ...<br> Do you like children?<br> I can not see them.<br> You find the world too rotten<br> in order to give birth to children?<br> Children are not born<br> they cleanse the world?<br> I had not thought of.<br> Enough to think.<br> And dinner?<br> You want to prepare here?<br> What to do with a piece of cheese?<br> I have a waterproof,<br> I can go to the grocery store.<br> This would be perfect!<br> I love to cook<br> but this is rarely a man.<br> I live with a girl.<br> - You relieve me.<br> Who is concerned about sex already?<br> - Okay ...<br> What does it buy?<br> - I'll make a list.<br> Leave me alone.<br> I want to think about everything.<br> I registered all except<br> commodities. Do it alone.<br> Hold.<br> Well, what do you expect?<br> I do not want to introduce myself<br> elections with your slogan.<br> "Affection without passion."<br> For me ...<br> You are not passionate<br> but hungry. Go to the grocer.<br> I'm faster than lightning.<br> Put boots.<br> It's pouring.<br> I never wear these ...<br> Put them!<br> - Do not order me!<br> This is my maternal instinct<br> speaking.<br> How old are you?<br> - 30 years, why?<br> Half, it's 15. 7.<br> It just falls!<br> What?<br> It is said that the woman must have<br> half the man's age plus 7.<br> What a woman ... What man?<br> - Nothing ...

Yes!<br> I told him:<br> "Small,<br> you would not have done that! "<br> Or something of the same kind.<br> Morality is not my forte.<br> - What did she say?<br> She said:<br> "You're right, it was a mistake."<br> Then she spun in her room<br> and took a shower.<br> And you went to seek a whip.<br> - You are misplaced joke.<br> My daughter has just said<br> that you had offended.<br> She did not say anything more specific?<br> She did not say it:<br> "It offended me."<br> And she repeated.<br> It lies.<br> I have not touched.
