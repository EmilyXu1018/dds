A golden<br> opportunity and it's down the drain...<br> ...as Bailey boggles the situation<br> and knocks the ball...<br> ...loose from Bivens' glove.<br> The Knights can do nothing right,<br> no matter what they try.<br> You ain't nailed to the ground.<br> Move.

I heard it.<br> Must've been the rain.<br> Stitches probably got loose.<br> It didn't start to rain<br> till after he hit the ball.<br> - The ball was defective.<br> - Defective. He made a meal out of it.<br> - What's the name of his bat?<br> - Wonderboy!<br> "Wonderboy."<br> You guys.

He's at that age.<br> I think he needs him.<br> Sure.<br> A father makes all the difference.<br> You gotta catch your train.<br> I can stay.<br> You'd better go.<br> Where to next?<br> Boston.<br> I'm sorry I missed your boy.<br> I'll tell him.<br> Roy Hobbs.<br> He won't believe it.<br> That's good!<br> Do a goose-step now!<br> I'm trying to shelter this guy.<br> Have a peanut, Bobby.<br> No, it's too late.<br> He's gonna be too old.<br> Did you do your homework?<br> All right!<br> Here goes nothing.<br> I blew a little too hard there.<br> Hobbs is making the whole situation<br> impossible to predict.<br> Only more difficult.<br> Hobbs will make it more interesting,<br> but he won't make the difference.<br> Safe! Safe!<br> He dropped the ball!<br> Here's the pitch.<br> Hobbs swings! Long fly ball!<br> That's right! Goodbye, Mr. Spalding!<br> The Knights have tied for the finish!<br> They've tied for the finish!<br> You can hear this crowd! They're<br> going crazy! They got Hobbs...<br> Knock it off!<br> Hey, knock it off!<br> We gotta win another game<br> before this is over.<br> Don't jinx this. Look at this!<br> Now, come on.<br> Go home, get some sleep.<br> Knock off the booze. No booze!<br> I'm sorry, there's no answer.<br> Would you place your call again later?<br> Okay, thanks.<br> The Knights simply have to win...<br> ...one game against the Phillies<br> to put them in the World Series.<br> That wraps it up here<br> for this post-game show.<br> I'll be right over to pick him up.<br> Protect your car<br> with Valvoline Motor Oil.<br> This is Jim Bauer inviting you<br> to join us...<br> Boy, did I miss you!<br> What's going on here?<br> A victory party.<br> We haven't won yet.<br> Whose place is this?<br> Mine.<br> At least it will be in a week.<br> - You must've hocked your fur for it.<br> - Never.<br> Gus chipped in.<br> How do you like it?<br> I like it.<br> I'm not so sure anymore...<br> ...after Chicago.<br> Come on, Memo, how about a dance?<br> Sure, Al.<br> Don't wait up, grandpa.<br> Welcome home, slugger.<br> Some blowout, huh?<br> All fresh food<br> from Jack and Charlie's.<br> How's the team holding up?<br> They can do no wrong.<br> When you're on a roll,<br> it's like that sometimes.<br> When you're not, every little thing<br> gets you down. What about you?<br> What about me?<br> I see you dug yourself<br> out of that hole you were in.<br> It must have cost you.<br> You're up, you're down.<br> How's the Judge treating you?<br> What's it to you?<br> Nothing.<br> Except it's a shame that son of a bitch<br> is paying a player like you...<br> ...rock-bottom salary.<br> - I can live with it.<br> - You gotta look to the future.<br> You can't build on what you don't got.<br> It's nice to know you worry<br> so much about a guy like me.<br> Listen, I'm just bringing it up<br> because I know Memo's crazy about you.<br> I mean, I wouldn't like to see you<br> lose her to a better provider.<br> Fame isn't enough, kid.<br> I'll take my chances.<br> Why should you, when we can all profit<br> from these little chats?<br> I mean, take tomorrow, for example.<br> Tomorrow I wouldn't bet against me.<br> You're missing the point, kid.<br> I already have.<br> You can't hang on to the game forever.<br> You can't get back into it<br> from jail either.<br> Isn't she something?<br> Yeah, she is.<br> What every guy would give<br> to be in your shoes, huh?<br> You're standing close. I can't tell<br> if it's your toes I'm feeling or mine.<br> I misjudged your boy.<br> I don't like being disappointed.<br> Try these clairs.<br> I was gonna go on this little...<br> The whipped cream's a little...<br> I don't like it.<br> It's not good for my stomach.<br> Try one of these.<br> Here.<br> Try this.<br> Thank you.<br> Having a great time,<br> take it, everybody!<br> You okay?<br> Roy, you okay? You okay?<br> Where's Pop?<br> "Where's Pop?" What are you, nuts?<br> Sit down.<br> Get me out of here.<br> Let's go.<br> Call a cab.<br> Come on, come on.<br> And how are we feeling today?<br> Where am I?<br> Tower Maternity, Roy.<br> I'm Dr. Newman.<br> It was an emergency,<br> and we were the closest.<br> They lost three in a row.<br> What's done is done.<br> Am I okay to play Monday?<br> I'm afraid there's some bad news.<br> The lining of your stomach<br> has been gradually deteriorating...<br> ...due to a previous injury.<br> We pumped your stomach<br> and came up with this.<br> This silver bullet head has been<br> in your stomach for some time.<br> Years, I would say.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> It's history.<br> Yes, but it could prove fatal<br> if you continue to play baseball.<br> Stop now, and in time<br> it could heal properly.<br> Can I play Monday?<br> The odds and your age<br> would be against you.<br> One day, your stomach could easily<br> blow apart, kill you on the spot.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Roy Hobbs, New York Knights' star,<br> is laid up...<br> ...at Tower Maternity Hospital<br> in New York City.<br> The full nature and extent<br> of his illness is as yet undisclosed.<br> His availability for Monday's<br> game against Pittsburgh...<br> ...remains a question.<br> Turning to local news...<br> May I come in?<br> You must've had a snoot full.<br> It was a great party.<br> I heard Gus and Max<br> talking last night.<br> What about?<br> He said that if you played Monday<br> it could kill you.<br> - It's a lie.<br> - No, it's not!<br> You're not gonna play.<br> Really, are you?<br> It would just be my last game.<br> It's his last game!<br> Well, that's rich!<br> You're trying to kill yourself,<br> aren't you?<br> Doc's making it out<br> worse than it is.<br> Oh, he is? Sure he is!<br> Hey, why not?<br> I look swell in black.<br> Don't you think I look swell in black?<br> I sure do.<br> Why don't we just get away?<br> Let's just go away right now.<br> I've been away long enough.<br> Oh, come on!<br> Why are you doing this?<br> What for?<br> Just to play one last game,<br> is that it?<br> It's all I've got left.<br> Then I can walk away.<br> Well, I have a small favour to ask.<br> Walk away right now...<br> ...and you'll live for sure.<br> That way we can see<br> a whole lot more of each other.<br> And you won't walk away empty-handed.<br> That's for sure.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean, Gus will stake us<br> to a lot of money.<br> We can buy into a company.<br> Everybody does that.<br> Think what we can do, Roy.<br> With your name, we'll make out fine.<br> If I skip the playoff?<br> Come on, Roy, you understand.<br> You make up your mind<br> to have certain things.<br> You know how it is.<br> Yes, I do.<br> Do you?<br> Just a few practice swings,<br> that's all.<br> Just to get back my timing.<br> It's my ass if Pop finds out.<br> We heard about that.<br> We heard about it already.<br> Just make sure you take it easy.<br> Roy's the money.<br> He gets hurt, we're out of a job!<br> We'll take it easy.<br> Just making a point. Take it easy.<br> Sometimes I wonder<br> what I'm doing in this game.<br> How do I get myself<br> in situations like this?<br> Diz, I think maybe<br> we heard that a couple of times.<br> He's always saying that. Don't know<br> about you, but he's making me nuts!<br> All right, here we go.<br> Come on, Diz.<br> You get that, Max?<br> Don't ever look back, Max! Ever!<br> Oh, my God!<br> Can you stand? Roy?<br> - We should've had more sense!<br> - It's all right. No one will know.<br> No one's gonna know.<br> Take it easy.<br> We better get you<br> back to the hospital.<br> Who's there?<br> Don't be alarmed.<br> I understand that you are playing.<br> - I wouldn't want you to dock my pay.<br> - On the contrary.<br> I wish to augment it with a bonus.<br> Now, as you may know,<br> we are favoured to win.<br> Which puts you back<br> working night court.<br> I have decided that<br> would be a grave mistake.<br> Now, financially speaking,<br> I can do better by not winning.<br> With your help, of course.<br> You put that in writing for Pop.<br> Now, as you may know, the prevailing<br> rate for this sort of thing...<br> ...is $10,000.<br> I'm offering you twice that.<br> You're wasting your time.<br> You know as well as I do that<br> you're in no condition to play.<br> Then why the 20,000?<br> Insurance.<br> You could get into the game.<br> You could wreck it<br> with an unexpected blow.<br> That'd be the beauty of it.<br> It's a monumental mistake, Hobbs...<br> ...in light of certain information<br> that I now possess.<br> Police photographs...<br> ...taken 15 years ago...<br> ...in a hotel room.<br> By the way...<br> ...that's you.<br> A nice young boy.<br> Half-naked lady...<br> ...lying in the street.<br> You, in her room, shot.<br> Nasty business.<br> Mercy.<br> Full disclosure of this scandal in the<br> eyes of your admirers and loved ones...<br> ...could only cause<br> humiliation. Embarrassment.<br> It was suicide.<br> Oh, Mr. Hobbs...<br> ...if kids should see this...<br> Now, it's a surprisingly<br> simple procedure.<br> You're to play your normal game,<br> except when you are at bat.<br> And then, under no circumstances,<br> are you to hit the ball safely.<br> They'll beat you without me.<br> Without you, they lost three in a row.<br> What is more, I have a contingency<br> plan for their flat failure.<br> Who else is in on this?<br> A key man.<br> Good night, Mr. Hobbs.<br> Here's another. Listen.<br> "We love to watch you hit that ball.<br> We cheer when you're connecting.<br> But it really shocked us, one and all,<br> to hear that you're expecting. "<br> Hold it. I didn't write those lines.<br> I didn't think you could read.<br> The babies. Please!<br> What about the babies?<br> How would you like to wake up to this?<br> I can't have this noise.<br> You're disturbing the mothers.<br> I guess that's you, guys.<br> Get well quick.<br> You just go out there<br> and play great ball.<br> Take care.<br> Get well, we need you. Take care.<br> Look out on the way out.<br> Just keep your eyes straight ahead.<br> It's gonna be tough without you, Roy.<br> Thanks, Diz.<br> Miss!<br> Hi, I'm Max Mercy, sports columnist<br> for The Daily Mirror.<br> I saw your picture in the paper.<br> Very nice.<br> Roy and I go back a long way. I wonder<br> if you'll help me a little on this.<br> See, I need a little help<br> if you could give some.<br> For Roy's defence, okay?<br> Now, you know this woman?<br> You know what happened?<br> Anything to do with a love quarrel?<br> You might have known her,<br> she knew you, a love triangle?<br> A bad joke.<br> I thought you might be able<br> to help us with some little clue.<br> I'm gonna do everything I can<br> to keep this story from breaking.<br> Hey, miss?<br> Is there...<br> ...a chair?<br> Doc says I have to quit baseball.<br> Why?<br> Some mistakes I guess<br> we never stop paying for.<br> I didn't even know her.<br> The girl on the train?<br> You liked her, didn't you?<br> Yes.<br> But I didn't see it coming.<br> How could you know she'd hurt you?<br> How could anyone?<br> - I didn't see it coming.<br> - You should've?<br> Yes.<br> But I didn't.<br> Why didn't I?<br> You were so young.<br> Things sure turned out different.<br> In what way?<br> Different.<br> For 16 years, I've lived<br> with the idea that I could be...<br> ...the best in the game.<br> You're so good now!<br> I could've been better.<br> I could've broke<br> every record in the book.<br> And then?<br> "And then?"<br> When I walked down the street,<br> people would've said:<br> "There goes Roy Hobbs, the best<br> there ever was in this game. "<br> You know, I believe we have two lives.<br> How? What do you mean?<br> The life we learn with and<br> the life we live with after that.<br> With or without the records...<br> ...they'll remember you.<br> Think of all those young boys<br> you've influenced.<br> There are so many of them.<br> That day in Chicago,<br> why did you stand up?<br> I didn't want to see you fail.<br> I wish Dad could've...<br> God, I love baseball.<br> Are you gonna go to the game tomorrow?<br> Is your son with you?<br> He is.<br> Excuse me.<br> Well, I gotta go.<br> Tomorrow, after we've lost...<br> ...I want Pop Fisher out of here,<br> bag and baggage.<br> That's right. Lay it all<br> on the line, Harry.<br> All of it.<br> That's right. You heard me.<br> I'll call back.<br> Slugger, you okay?<br> I'm fine.<br> - You look a little lost.<br> - I'm not.<br> You dropped this on your way out.<br> Something seems amiss.<br> Correct me if I'm wrong, Hobbs,<br> but we had a deal.<br> No.<br> Those are your winnings.<br> This is a gag.<br> Pick it up, get out.<br> If it isn't enough money,<br> tell us what you've got in mind.<br> To hit away.<br> I thought I could rely on your honour.<br> You're about to.<br> You're a foolish, foolish man.<br> You've forgotten something.<br> Your past.<br> I don't care. Go on.<br> Get on the phone.<br> No.<br> That won't be necessary.<br> I like the action.<br> Then let it ride.<br> You bastard!<br> I hate you.<br> I hate you.<br> You were right, Memo.<br> We have met before.<br> You're a lot weaker than I thought.<br> What do you think this changes?<br> Have Max draw you a picture. You can<br> read about it in the morning paper.<br> You're yesterday's news, kid.<br> You had a great gift, a talent.<br> But it's not enough.<br> I think you're a loser.<br> You can't let him go.<br> Relax.<br> With his insides, he's as good<br> to us now as he was before.<br> Besides, we're $20,000 richer.<br> I wanted to win that pennant worse than<br> I wanted any goddamned thing in my life.<br> You'd think I could<br> just this once, wouldn't you?<br> I didn't care nothing<br> about the Series.<br> Win or lose,<br> I would have been satisfied.<br> I'd have walked away from baseball,<br> and I'd have bought a farm.<br> Nothing like a farm.<br> Nothing like being around animals,<br> fixing things.<br> There's nothing like being in the field<br> with the corn and the winter wheat.<br> The greenest stuff you ever saw.<br> You know, my mother told me<br> I ought to be a farmer.<br> My dad wanted me to be<br> a baseball player.<br> You're better than<br> anyone I ever had.<br> And you're the best<br> goddamned hitter I ever saw.<br> Suit up.<br> Still dogging me, huh, Max?<br> End of the road, Hobbs.<br> You wanna hear what I think<br> our chances are?<br> You read my mind.<br> That takes all of 3 seconds.<br> They come and they go, Hobbs.<br> They come and they go.<br> I'll be around here longer<br> than you or anybody else here.<br> I'm here to protect this game.<br> Whose game?<br> I do it by making<br> or breaking the likes of you.<br> Did you ever play ball, Max?<br> No, never have.<br> But I make it a little<br> more fun to watch, you see.<br> And after today, whether<br> you're a goat or a hero...<br> ...you're gonna make me a great story.<br> See you around.<br> And here come the New York Knights<br> as they take the field.<br> Everyone will have their eyes<br> on Hobbs, whose illness came close...<br> ...to shattering<br> the Knights' dream of a pennant.<br> Hobbs moving to his position<br> in right field.<br> And just listen to that crowd<br> go wild for Hobbs!<br> Unbelievable!<br> Let's go, Knights!<br> He looks like he's set<br> and ready to go.<br> This is for the National<br> League Pennant!<br> The Knights versus Pittsburgh!<br> The playoff game!<br> Play ball!<br> Al Fowler on the mound. Two outs<br> as he faces Schaffer. The pitch!<br> Schaffer swings! Fly ball going out<br> over the field! Hobbs goes back fast!<br> The Pirates go down 1-2-3<br> in the 1 st inning.<br> - Feel okay?<br> - Bivens going in against Youngberry.<br> Youngberry, ex cellent control.<br> The pitch!<br> Strike 3, inside corner!<br> Now batting, number 18, John Olsen.<br> Come on, Roy!<br> And strike 1 on Olsen.<br> Strike 2!<br> Hobbs kneels next to Bobby Savoy,<br> the batboy for the Knights.<br> Strike 3! Olsen badly fooled!<br> Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs!<br> Come on, Roy!<br> And listen to that chant!<br> The Roy Hobbs chant!<br> Hobbs batting.<br> Hobbs bats against Youngberry.<br> Youngberry...<br> ...who made fifth place this year.<br> Here's the pitch!<br> Swung on and missed!<br> Hobbs fooled by that pitch.<br> Now stepping back to the plate.<br> Youngberry gets set.<br> Hobbs has been 3 for 6<br> so far this season.<br> Youngberry looking in for the sign.<br> He goes to the wind-up.<br> The pitch!<br> Inside corner, strike 2! The<br> crowd was not happy with the pitch.<br> An ex cellent call.<br> Youngberry looks in once again.<br> Hobbs sets himself. The concentration.<br> Youngberry to the wind-up.<br> The pitch!<br> Strike 3!<br> Hobbs is out of there.<br> And so at the end of one inning,<br> no score at all.<br> The big question is whether or not<br> Hobbs can get his timing back.<br> After a four-day layoff, it's difficult<br> for a hitter to step into the game.<br> Hobbs came directly to the field with<br> no batting practice this afternoon.<br> At the end of 3 innings,<br> no score.<br> Fowler looking in against Boyle.<br> Boyle, the count, 3 and 1.<br> The pitch! And he walks.<br> Terrific so far this afternoon.<br> Here comes Allen.<br> Allen's last time up grounded<br> out to 1 st base. Fowler looking in.<br> Boyle over on 1 st base.<br> Allen has good power.<br> Allen swings! Fly ball!<br> Back, back! Hobbs drifting back.<br> That's out of here!<br> The score is 2 to nothing.<br> Pittsburgh strikes first.<br> Fowler up until this point<br> has been absolutely outstanding.<br> That one got away from him.<br> Fowler not happy with it at all.<br> You can feel the anxiety<br> spreading through this crowd.<br> Time!<br> This is a little unusual.<br> Roy Hobbs has called time out<br> and is heading in to see Fowler.<br> It's kind of an unusual situation.<br> Play ball!<br> Don't do it.<br> If this is for show,<br> you can cut the crap.<br> Give them the real stuff, Al.<br> I'll start pitching<br> when you start hitting.<br> What the hell's going on?<br> It's a surprise.<br> It's okay, Pop.<br> Let's play ball.<br> Two to nothing,<br> the Knights at bat.<br> - This is it, Roy!<br> - Swing it, Hobbs!<br> Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs!<br> Come on, Roy!<br> Youngberry, the pitch!<br> A swing and a miss.<br> Hobbs misses.<br> Swing and a miss!<br> Strike 2!<br> Strike 3!<br> Hobbs falls to the ground!<br> Hobbs tried and missed it.<br> Knocked him to the ground.<br> Picks himself up again.<br> Youngberry overpowering.<br> Hobbs just hasn't been able<br> to put it together this evening.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I'll be back.<br> Excuse me.<br> It's all right, slugger!<br> Come on, Hobbs!<br> It's important<br> that Roy Hobbs gets this.<br> I just can't do that.<br> I know. I have his son in the stands.<br> He doesn't know his son is here.<br> - I can't do it.<br> - Please. I don't know what to say.<br> At the end of 6 innings,<br> no score at all for the Knights.<br> At the end of 6 innings,<br> again, 2 to nothing.<br> The Knights still...<br> LaJong hits the ball into the field!<br> Here comes the throw!<br> And Frenchie is out of there!<br> Shouldn't have gone for two.<br> He's trying to get something started.<br> At the end of 7,<br> Fowler's been overpowering<br> ever since the 4th inning.<br> Getting himself settled down.<br> Fowler looking in against Yancey.<br> The pitch!<br> Throw, swing and a miss!<br> Strike 3!<br> At the top half of the 9th,<br> still 2 to nothing.<br> Two outs right now. Bivens going<br> back to get himself another bat.<br> Nothing has worked so far.<br> Maybe he'll try another one. Bivens...<br> ...0 for 2 today. The pitch!<br> There's the shot over the right field!<br> Allen picks it up.<br> He's throwing it!<br> There's the throw! He is safe!<br> Hobbs is 0 for 2.<br> What a game we have tonight!<br> From the stretch, Youngberry looks...<br> The pitch!<br> Olsen swings!<br> Ground down to 3rd base!<br> Run, you son of a bitch! Run!<br> The ball rolls free!<br> Bivens takes 3rd!<br> Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs.<br> Come on, Roy!<br> The pitch!<br> Hobbs has been<br> an outstanding player all year!<br> Youngberry! The pitch again!<br> Time out! Heading for the mound.<br> That may be it for Youngberry.<br> Taking no chances at all. That's it.<br> He's gonna go for a left-hander.<br> Youngberry not happy at all about this.<br> Youngberry has only given up<br> A beautiful pitching performance.<br> Let's go!<br> Young John Rhoades<br> strides to the mound.<br> A Nebraska farm boy,<br> blazing left-handed speed.<br> The Pirate organization expects<br> great things for him.<br> You can hit it!<br> They say he's got the best fastball<br> in the major leagues right now.<br> This is the game for the World Series.<br> One of these teams will be, tomorrow,<br> playing in the World Series.<br> It comes down to this.<br> Hobbs, with determination,<br> trying to make it happen.<br> The pitch! He swings!<br> Oh, my God!<br> He's trying to destroy<br> the press box right next to us!<br> Absolutely broke the glass<br> right next to our radio booth here!<br> Strike!<br> This is it!<br> This is the game right now.<br> Hobbs is at the bat still.<br> He brought them this far.<br> Will he take them all the way?<br> The pitch!

Hobbs did it!<br>
