                        Let the words of my mouth,<br> and the meditation of my heart...<br> ...be always acceptable in thy sight.<br> O Lord, my strength...<br> ...and my redeemer.<br> The sermon for today...<br> ...is taken from Proverbs.<br> Chapter 25...<br> ...verse 28.<br> "He that hath no rule over his own spirit...<br> ...is like a city that is broken down,<br> and without walls."<br> And I wonder as we examine our hearts<br> together in this place set aside for worship...<br> ...how many of us here can say,<br> "I rule my own spirit."<br> For how weak is man.<br> How often do we...<br> How often...<br> How often do we stray from<br> the straight and narrow.<br> For only when we abide in the Lord<br> are we like cities without walls.<br> Only then can we defend ourselves<br> against Satan and his temptations.<br> We cannot rule ourselves alone.<br> God only is our... Is our...<br> God only is our help.<br> And our salvation.<br> All right! You know!<br> That's why you're here!<br> To see this city with its broken walls!<br> "Whenever two or three<br> are gathered in my name"...<br> ...is what scripture says.<br> That's not why you're here.<br> Let's change the words. Let's rewrite<br> the order of the Morning Prayer.<br> Whenever two or three or 20 or 30<br> or 200 or 300...<br> ...are gathered together<br> to make whispered comment...<br> ...to sit in judgment upon<br> the condition of a... Of a what?<br> Yes, of a man of God.<br> I said, man of God, and I mean it!<br> Just what you all know, that your pastor,<br> your spiritual shepherd is...<br> Is the descendant of a clergyman,<br> the grandson of two bishops.<br> But there were collateral branches to the<br> family that went forth to brave dangers...<br> ...and who were scalped.<br> Men with men's hearts,<br> the wild and free hearts of men!<br> They knew hunger<br> and they fed their appetites.<br> They fed their appetites.<br> Appetites that I have inherited.<br> I defy you! Shannon defies you!<br> Get out your tomahawks!<br> Get out your scalping knives!<br> Sharpen your scalping knives! Scalp me!<br> I will not and cannot continue to conduct<br> services in praise and worship of this...<br> ...angry, petulant old man<br> in whom you believe.<br> You've turned your backs on the God<br> of love and compassion...<br> ...and invented for yourself<br> this cruel, senile delinquent...<br> ...who blames the world and all that<br> he created for his own faults.<br> Close your windows! Close your doors!<br> Close your hearts<br> against the truth about God!<br> Hello there.<br> - Where are they?<br> - Still inside the church.<br> I'm sick of dark old churches.<br> I like sunshine.<br> I'm sorry. I keep forgetting what<br> you were. I mean, what you are.<br> What?<br> Lovely, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What do you call it again?<br> "Cup of gold."<br> Could you drink from it, really?<br> Champagne for two in copa de oro.<br> - Dr. Shannon.<br> - Miss Fellowes. Here you are, Miss Peebles.<br> The same brand even.<br> Fix you up in no time.<br> - Oh, I am grateful. How much do I owe you?<br> - Six pesos-fifty.<br> But it was only six pesos<br> in Ciudad Jurez.<br> - I have it written down right here.<br> - It doesn't matter, Judith, really, it doesn't.<br> Ciudad Jurez is 1200 miles behind us,<br> Miss Fellowes.<br> I thought it was too far to go<br> to save 4 cents.<br> - Are we downhearted?<br> - No.<br> Fantastic!<br> Did you see that?<br> Look. There's another.<br> What have those boys got, Dr. Shannon?<br> Iguanas. Giant lizards native<br> to this part of Mexico.<br> It is alleged they taste like chicken.<br> You mean they really<br> eat those awful-looking creatures?<br> - Hank, stop on the bridge.<br> - Stop?<br> Yeah, on the bridge.<br> What are we stopping for?<br> A moment of beauty, Miss Fellowes.<br> A fleeting glimpse<br> into the lost world...<br> ...of innocence.<br> Look, Reverend,<br> we're behind schedule now.<br> Drive on, driver.<br> Okay.<br> My brother in Abilene,<br> that's Clarence Throxton...<br> ...has a chain of 23 laundromats.<br> He says all he wants<br> on his tombstone is:<br> "He liberated the women of Texas<br> from the bondage of wash day."<br> Aren't they unbelievable?<br> Squawk, squawk, squawk,<br> ever since we started.<br> If they want all the comforts of home,<br> then why don't they stay at home?<br> My goodness, this has been<br> a rich experience.<br> It sure has.<br> Everything's gone wrong<br> from the first day.<br> Every calamity in the book.<br> The whole trip has been hoodooed.<br> You better get back, Miss Goodall,<br> where you belong.<br> You said it was going to be Charlotte.<br> All right. Charlotte.<br> - And I can't go on calling you Dr. Shannon.<br> - Just "Shannon" will be fine.<br> Couldn't it be Larry,<br> if you're gonna call me Charlotte?<br> Honey, have a heart.<br> I have, Larry. I've just discovered.<br> Now you change places with me,<br> Charlotte, dear.<br> I want to talk to Dr. Shannon<br> about our itinerary.<br> I'll see you later, Larry.<br> I assume you know that Charlotte<br> is underaged, Dr. Shannon?<br> What's that got to do with our itinerary?<br> If you know what's good for you,<br> leave her alone.<br> Miss Fellowes, are you aware you are<br> speaking to an ordained clergyman?<br> Stop leading her on.<br> I don't know what happened back<br> in Tierra Caliente and I don't want to know.<br> Because if I did know,<br> I'd have to take steps.<br> Don't make me take steps,<br> Dr. Shannon.<br> Now, nothing happened<br> back in Tierra Caliente.<br> The room clerk got our keys mixed up,<br> that's all. A mistake, pure and simple.<br> Whatever suspicions you may be harboring<br> are quite groundless.<br> I can assure you of that.<br> Just leave her alone.<br> Don't make me take steps.<br> All right, girls, ready for another song?<br> These pills aren't doing anything for me.<br> Not anything!<br> - Puncture.<br> - Blowout.<br> Burned-out brake linings.<br> Broken fan belt, three flat tires.<br> These are the unavoidable mishaps<br> of any trip, Miss Fellowes.<br> Won't take more than a few moments<br> to change wheels.<br> Says you, reverend.<br> We're fresh out of wheels to change.<br> We gotta get that tire off and put on<br> a patch. Take maybe half an hour.<br> You take care of it for me, Hank.<br> Judith!<br> - I need you!<br> - Oh, all right, Peebie.<br> It's lovely, isn't it?<br> Yeah.<br> Are you really a man of the cloth, Larry?<br> - Who says I'm not?<br> - No one. I just wondered.<br> How can you ask such a question?<br> Doesn't Blake's Tours advertise tours<br> personally conducted by the...<br> ...Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon?<br> Could they make such a claim<br> without justification?<br> I'm so glad you are.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> Well, it's such a noble life.<br> I mean, being interested in people's souls<br> and all that.<br> You can bring so much to people.<br> Someone like me even.<br> I can talk to you.<br> Like, I'd never dream of going swimming<br> with Reverend Hotchkiss back home.<br> I mean, he's old.<br> Now, lie down on the back seat, Peebie.<br> Put your feet up.<br> - Driver, have you seen Miss Goodall?<br> - Yeah, I've seen her.<br> Well? Well, where is she?<br> He's got her. Out there.<br> Charlotte.<br> Charlotte.<br> Charlotte.<br> Charlotte.<br> - There was this boy back home.<br> - Charlotte.<br> He thought he was in love with me.<br> - Really, he made life just impossible.<br> - Charlotte.<br> So Daddy fixed it for me to take a trip.<br> Naturally, he wanted me to be<br> chaperoned in a strange country.<br> - Charlotte!<br> - Life's so odd.<br> - Yeah.<br> - lf it hadn't been for that silly boy...<br> ...I might never have met you.<br> - Charlotte!<br> - Take my hand, Larry.<br> What for?<br> So we don't drift apart.<br> Charlotte, I command you<br> to come back here.<br> Charlotte Goodall.<br> You only got to come on this trip<br> because of me!<br> Charlotte. Charlotte, you hear me?<br> Charlotte, I know you can hear me.<br> You are deliberately defying me.<br> Charlotte!<br> Charlotte! You stay away from that man!<br> You hear?<br> Charlotte, your mother put you<br> in my charge.<br> I am responsible. Charlotte!<br> You only got to come on this trip<br> because of me!<br> Charlotte!<br> Why, Miss Fellowes.<br> Dreadful girl.<br> Defied me.<br> You deliberately defied me!<br> What did you think we were doing<br> out there, Miss Fellowes? Spawning?<br> Oh, you beast! You beast!<br> You beast.<br> Hey! Hey, what are you doing?<br> You... You get out of here!<br> - My God, it's 3:00 in the morning.<br> - I've got to see you.<br> - It's important. My whole life's at stake.<br> - Oh, well, my job's at stake.<br> You don't have to worry<br> about this measly old job.<br> My goodness. Back home, my daddy's<br> got three Ford agencies.<br> At the moment, I don't see a Ford<br> in my future.<br> Have you been drinking, Larry?<br> Honey girl, if I'd been drinking,<br> I wouldn't be here. I'd still be drinking.<br> Then what's wrong?<br> Why are you all hot and sweaty?<br> You won't misunderstand me, I mean,<br> my being here in your room.<br> Promise me you won't think...<br> That boy back home told me<br> that I had skin that no girl had any right to.<br> Said it should be licensed to have skin<br> as soft as mine is.<br> - Wasn't it silly of him?<br> - No.<br> Yes. I mean, no, no.<br> No, it should be licensed.<br> I mean, at least until you're...<br> Until you're old enough...<br> ...for a driver's license. Now, you get out<br> of my room. You get off my bed.<br> I'll... I'll keep my eyes<br> shut until you've gone out of my room.<br> - Have I grown up too early, Larry?<br> - Yes. No, I mean... Yes, yes.<br> O Lord, lead me not into temptation.<br> And now, go on home.<br> I'll find my way all by myself.<br> - That's what I came to tell you.<br> - What?<br> I'm going home.<br> Tomorrow, from Puerto Vallarta.<br> I'm catching the plane at Puerto Vallarta.<br> I'll slip away from that possessive old bitch<br> while she's having her siesta...<br> ...and be gone before she knows it.<br> You mustn't tell her where I've gone.<br> Let her sweat it a little.<br> Let her think<br> I've just disappeared into the jungle.<br> But I couldn't let you worry.<br> I had to say goodbye to you...<br> ...or rather, au revoir.<br> Because when you bring them back...<br> ...l'll be there waiting for you...<br> ... copa de oro in my hair,<br> just over the border.<br> Honey, the border I'm crossing over<br> is the border of sanity, honey.<br> - No.<br> - Oh, honey, yes.<br> I've got it figured out, darling.<br> What you should have is a nice big church<br> in Thunderbird Heights...<br> Daddy's a big wheel there.<br> - and a wife who understands<br> the nobility of your mission.<br> - No, no.<br> - Yes, not no. I'll fix it. Daddy will fix it.<br> - No.<br> - Yes.<br> "He that hath no rule<br> over his own spirit is like a...<br> ...city that has broken down<br> and without walls."<br> I'll rule your spirit.<br> I'll hold you.<br> - No. No, no. No.<br> - Yes. Yes, yes.<br> Charlotte.<br> Charlotte...<br> ...l've told you how sorry I am.<br> You can afford to be generous.<br> I was just beside myself with anger.<br> But I never meant to harm you.<br> I wouldn't harm you for all the world.<br> Charlotte.<br> Charlotte, you've got to forgive me.<br> I can't stand being so unhappy.<br> Shannon?<br> Shannon, open the door.<br> You hear me, Shannon.<br> You've got that child in there.<br> Open up right now.<br> I've had it. She'll tell my father,<br> she'll tell everybody.<br> He's got her in there with him.<br> The door's locked.<br> Nobody's mixed any keys up this time.<br> I won't have it. I just won't have it.<br> You're through, Shannon.<br> And I'll see to that.<br> When I finish with you,<br> there won't be any place left to hide.<br> It's all right, Miss Fellowes.<br> Virtue is triumphant. Yours, of course.<br> Wait. Just you wait.<br> Good morning. We have a wonderful<br> trip ahead of us.<br> Some of the most beautiful<br> scenery in this part of Mexico.<br> I took the liberty of getting souvenirs<br> of our stay in Los Feliz.<br> I love you.<br> No charge. Compliments of the<br> Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon.<br> Miss Peebles.<br> Where's Miss Fellowes?<br> You think you could pull a stunt<br> like last night and get away with it?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I mean, it's in the fan.<br> This morning,<br> she had a wire all written out...<br> ...to some Judge Fellowes back in Texas.<br> She wants your life story<br> from the first time you said "Mama."<br> - How do you know that?<br> - She asked me to send it, that's how.<br> I told her that was no part<br> of no driver's job.<br> - Good man, Hank.<br> - You ain't off the hook.<br> Miss Fellowes went over<br> to Telegrfico herself.<br> She aims to have your hide, Reverend.<br> Good morning, Miss Fellowes.<br> I'll... I'll drive.<br> We're there, Peebie, your troubles are over.<br> Now you can have a nice bath.<br> "The Ambos Mundos Hotel<br> in Puerto Vallarta...<br> ...is a completely modern,<br> air-conditioned hotel...<br> ...on a delightful plaza,<br> with excellent food and service."<br> Shannon? Shannon, that's our hotel.<br> Shannon. Stop.<br> Stop this instant.<br> Shannon. Shannon!<br> What the hell you trying to do, Reverend?<br> Get us all killed?<br> - You gone crazy or something?<br> - This is not the Ambos Mundos.<br> It says in the brochure we stop in Ambos<br> Mundos, in the heart of Puerto Vallarta.<br> Here we are, ladies, this is Mismaloya,<br> the garden spot of the West Coast.<br> You'll be grateful to me to your dying days.<br> In all of Mexico,<br> there's nothing to equal this.<br> The chef is a Chinese, specially<br> imported from Shanghai by me.<br> Just leave your bags.<br> The staff will take care of everything.<br> Take us right back<br> to Puerto Vallarta where we belong.<br> I'm expecting an important telegram.<br> - I can't take you no place.<br> - Why not?<br> Because Reverend's taken the<br> distributor head, that's why not.<br> Shannon.<br> Shannon, you won't get away with this!<br> Fred?<br> Fred?<br> Shannon.<br> What the hell are you doing<br> down here out of season?<br> Would you have one of your boys<br> lug this bag up for me?<br> Pepe.<br> Fred, where are you?<br> Fred can't hear you, baby.<br> Why? Gone fishing?<br> How long have you been off it?<br> - Off what?<br> - The wagon.<br> I'm not drunk.<br> - Oh, what's the matter with you then?<br> - Fever, just fever.<br> - Where's Fred?<br> - Dead.<br> - Did you say dead?<br> - That's what I said. Fred's dead.<br> How? When?<br> Oh, less than four weeks ago.<br> Died with his boots on, though. Hooked<br> into a big marlin, the marlin won.<br> I was counting on Fred to bail me out,<br> straighten me out and bail me out.<br> He was my hope of salvation.<br> I had all my chips on Fred.<br> - Baby, you're going to pieces, aren't you?<br> - Yeah, yeah. They...<br> They are tearing me to pieces.<br> I was hanging on until I could get<br> to the hammock on the veranda...<br> ...over the rainforest and still-water beach.<br> It's all that can pull me through.<br> Honey, just lie down the hammock.<br> I'll fix you a nice rum-coco.<br> No, no, no. If I start drinking<br> rum-cocos now, I'll never stop.<br> Reverend!<br> They want us to go back into town.<br> Well, tell them they can't go<br> back into town.<br> I thought Fred could tame them.<br> He was a fisherman, and I've got<br> a busload of man-eating sharks.<br> - I've gotta get those women up here.<br> - No, you don't.<br> We're closed in August.<br> We're always closed in August.<br> Quit blowing, and blow!<br> Maxine. Maxine, you gotta help me.<br> - Honey, you're really gone.<br> - Maxine, I can't lose this party.<br> Blake's Tours have put me on probation<br> because I had a bad party last month.<br> They tried to get me fired,<br> so now I'm on probation.<br> If I lose this party, I'll be fired for sure.<br> And what's next, Maxine?<br> There's nothing,<br> nothing lower than Blake's Tours.<br> Okay, okay, baby.<br> If it's that important to you...<br> ...they can stay here.<br> Here comes your sidekick now.<br> His name's Hank. Hank.<br> - You gotta help me with him.<br> - Sure.<br> - I'll give him complimentary rum-coco.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Not until he's got the bus unloaded.<br> You ain't getting away with it.<br> Some of the ladies are in bad shape.<br> They'll walk back if you don't give me<br> that distributor head.<br> They'll drop like flies from sunstroke<br> in this heat. Hank, I need your cooperation.<br> This is a test of strength, Hank,<br> between two men and a crate of wet hens.<br> You know that, don't you?<br> I know what I'm doing, Hank.<br> Don't you forget that.<br> Now, the bell cow sent a telegram from<br> Los Feliz this morning, right?<br> That answer will come to their hotel<br> in Puerto Vallarta, right?<br> But if we're not there,<br> no answer can be delivered, right?<br> Lizzie Borden won't get to wield her ax.<br> That's why I brought them up here. Working<br> every minute. Now, all I need is a little time.<br> To reestablish myself in the esteem...<br> ...of those old...<br> The good ladies of our party.<br> By this time tomorrow, they'll<br> be eating out of the palm of my hand.<br> Of that, you have the assurance<br> of the Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon.<br> What assurance you give<br> the kid you been leading on?<br> Leading on? Hank, if you are<br> to succeed in this business...<br> ...you must give factual reports without<br> exaggeration. That's a definite exaggeration.<br> I've exercised every ingenuity<br> of which a man is capable...<br> ...to keep at bay the advances<br> of this precocious jezebel.<br> That's a hell of a way to talk about<br> an innocent young girl.<br> You sure weren't doing no avoiding<br> when you got her up in your pad last night.<br> Ha-ha, very funny.<br> Without no exaggeration,<br> whatever happens to Reverend ain't enough.<br> Avoiding her? She laid it<br> on the line down there...<br> ...why you shanghaied us up here.<br> - Hank...<br> I heard your story.<br> But that ain't her story.<br> She said that she planned<br> to take the plane from Puerto Vallarta...<br> ...and you couldn't stand for it<br> to see her go.<br> Fantastic. That's fantastic.<br> Mrs. Faulk, honey...<br> ...give him a menu. Give him one of your<br> sample menus to show the ladies.<br> One of your fantastic sample menus.<br> There you are, thank you.<br> There you are, Hank.<br> Now you go back down there and show<br> this fantastic sample menu to the ladies.<br> Describe the view from the hill,<br> the palatial appointments of the hotel...<br> ...anything you like.<br> You get them up here, Hank.<br> A fine, upstanding young man.<br> So you appropriated the young chick<br> and the old hens are squawking, huh?<br> It's very serious. The child<br> is emotionally precocious.<br> - Bully for her.<br> - Also, she is traveling under the wing...<br> ...of a military escort<br> of a butch vocal teacher.<br> I wonder how long it takes to sweat<br> the faculty of a Baptist Female College...<br> ...out of a bus that's parked in the sun<br> when it's a 100 degrees in the shade.<br> - Well, they're staggering out of it now.<br> - They are?<br> I've won this round, I reckon.<br> Good old Hank.<br> Good old Hank better take cover.<br> Look at her, charging like<br> a bull elephant on a rampage.<br> Maxine, you gotta<br> help me with her, honey.<br> She's not only trying to get me fired,<br> she's also trying to pin on me...<br> ...a rape charge,<br> a charge of statutory rape.<br> Statutory rape?<br> I've never known what that was.<br> That's when a man's seduced by a girl<br> under 20. That's not funny, Maxine.<br> Why do you always want<br> the young ones, honey?<br> I don't want any,<br> any, regardless of age.<br> Why do you take them, Shannon?<br> Huh, Shannon?<br> - Well, people need human contact, Maxine.<br> - Shannon!<br> Shannon! You're a fake.<br> Come on up, Miss Fellowes.<br> Everything's fixed.<br> Never do that, Miss Fellowes.<br> Not at high noon in a tropical country<br> in summer. Never charge uphill...<br> ...like you're leading a troop of cavalry<br> attacking an impregnable position.<br> I don't want advice or instructions.<br> I want that distributor head.<br> This is one of the charming ladies of whom<br> I was speaking. Mrs. Faulk, Miss Fellowes.<br> - Hello.<br> - Is this man making a deal with you?<br> - What sort of deal?<br> - Is this man getting a kickback from you?<br> Look, honey,<br> nobody gets a kickback out of me.<br> - I turn away more people...<br> - Have you got a telephone?<br> - Sure.<br> - I wanna make a call to Texas.<br> - Collect, of course.<br> - Right in the office there.<br> When the hell did you get<br> a telephone in here?<br> Old Fred, he finally got the telephone<br> company to run a wire up here.<br> Well, you get in there,<br> and find out who she's talking to.<br> And don't let her get through to<br> Blake's Tours. She's trying to get me fired.<br> We're almost there, Peebie.<br> Just a little further.<br> Miss Peebles, I am delighted.<br> I knew common sense would prevail.<br> You'll be enchanted with Mismaloya.<br> Look at this view.<br> We're not here out of choice,<br> we're here out of necessity.<br> - Miss Peebles is ill. She requires a...<br> - A bathroom.<br> A bathroom, a bathroom.<br> Hank, get the luggage out of the bus.<br> Help yourselves, ladies.<br> Bungalows are all yours.<br> Here you are, Miss Peebles,<br> to comfort and privacy.<br> - Peebie,<br> - We couldn't help it, Judith, Peebie...<br> Just a temporary indisposition.<br> Mrs. Faulk is looking after her personally.<br> That's the service you get here.<br> Now you and Charlotte,<br> Miss Goodall, can share this one.<br> I want a room of my own.<br> That's perfectly all right with me.<br> She can have a room of her own.<br> I no longer assume any responsibility<br> for her actions. She's a free agent.<br> Until we get back to civilization.<br> Hank.<br> Let me have Miss Fellowes' bag.<br> Thank you.<br> This way, Miss Fellowes.<br> Miss Fellowes, did you get<br> your call through?<br> Circuits were busy,<br> they'll call me back.<br> Miss Fellowes, please,<br> please give me a minute.<br> Well? Well, what is it?<br> Well, it's just that like...<br> Like everybody else<br> at some time or other in life...<br> ...my life has cracked up on me.<br> How does that compensate us?<br> Miss Fellowes, I've just confessed<br> to you that I'm at the end of my rope.<br> Please, Miss Fellowes, don't make me<br> feel that any human being...<br> ...would put personal compensation<br> before the ugly bare fact...<br> ...of a man who's at the end of his rope,<br> but who still has to try to go on.<br> Now you listen to me.<br> We girls have worked and slaved...<br> ...all year at Baptist Female College for<br> this Mexican tour, and the tour is a cheat.<br> Fantastic.<br> For days we've been holed<br> in that stifling bus...<br> ...over the byways, off the highways.<br> Shook up and bumped up<br> so you could get your rake off.<br> All of the girls in this party<br> have dysentery.<br> That you cannot blame me for.<br> I passed out mimeographed instructions:<br> What to eat, what not to eat,<br> what to drink, what not to drink.<br> It's not what, but where<br> we ate that gave us dysentery.<br> It's not dysentery, not<br> even amoebic. It's nothing...<br> It's Montezuma's revenge.<br> That's what we call it down here:<br> Aztec two-step.<br> Do you? Well, I intend to have<br> my revenge, Dr. Shannon.<br> Honey, I don't think even old Fred<br> could have calmed her down.<br> You go lie down.<br> - Okay, Shannon.<br> - What you gonna do?<br> Did you ever have a shave<br> by a lady barber?<br> I can shave myself, Maxine.<br> With those shakes?<br> How long you had them, Shannon?<br> They've been incubating ever since the trip<br> started. It's been a nightmare all the way.<br> Culminating with the Witch of Endor<br> threatening to hound me to the grave.<br> That's when blind panic took over.<br> That's when the spook moved in.<br> Is that all your spook is, honey?<br> Just panic?<br> Maxine, don't say "just panic"<br> like you'd say "just leprosy."<br> Panic's serious.<br> Who'd Madame Lafarge<br> put that phone call to?<br> - Some judge in Corpus Christi.<br> - I knew it.<br> - Where you going?<br> - To tear that phone out...<br> In a pig's eye!<br> That phone cost me 1200 pesos<br> to get in here.<br> You just lie back, baby,<br> and when I get you all prettied up...<br> ...l'll go and cancel that call.<br> I see you got your gold cross on.<br> Thinking about going back to the church?<br> I wrote my old bishop last night,<br> a letter of complete capitulation.<br> How come you don't quit<br> kidding yourself?<br> You ain't thinking about going back<br> to no church...<br> ...or you wouldn't be so scared of losing<br> this cotton-picking job of yours.<br> You know, folks don't go to church<br> to hear atheistical sermons being preached.<br> Damn it to hell. I never preached an atheist<br> sermon in church in all my life.<br> All right, baby, all right.<br> What size shoe you wear, baby?<br> I do not get the point of that question.<br> Well, these shoes look shot to me.<br> If I remember correctly<br> you only travel with one pair.<br> Now, old Fred's estate includes<br> one good pair of shoes.<br> And your feet look about the same size.<br> I loved old Fred, Maxine,<br> but I do not want to fill his shoes.<br> You could do worse, baby.<br> You could do worse.<br> Which way is the sea?<br> It's right down there, but we can't see it<br> because of the trees.<br> I can feel it and smell it.<br> It's the cradle of life.<br> Are these two with your party?<br> They look like a couple of loonies.<br> Life began in the sea.<br> Oh! Oh, how do you do?<br> Hello.<br> Have you ever tried helping a gentleman...<br> ...who can't walk,<br> uphill through a rain forest?<br> No. I wouldn't even try it downhill.<br> Anything I can do for you folks?<br> Well, now that we've made it,<br> I don't regret the effort.<br> What a view for a painter!<br> They told me in the town<br> this was the ideal place for a painter.<br> And they weren't exaggerating.<br> Anything I can do for you?<br> Yes, yes, I'm looking for<br> the manager of the hotel.<br> Oh, that's me. Speaking.<br> You're the manager. Oh, good.<br> I'm Hannah Jelkes. How do you do?<br> - Mrs...?<br> - Faulk. Maxine Faulk.<br> You're looking for rooms?<br> Yes, yes, we are, but we've come<br> without reservations.<br> Well, honey, we're closed in August,<br> except for a few special guests.<br> Well, look at them.<br> If they're not special, who the hell is?<br> Honey, that old man ought to be<br> in a hospital.<br> No. Oh, no, no, he just sprained<br> his ankle a little this morning.<br> Come on, Grandpa. Two steps,<br> one, two. There you are.<br> Hannah, tell the lady<br> that my frailty is temporary.<br> I will soon be able to crawl<br> and then to toddle.<br> And before long I'll be leaping<br> around here like an old mountain goat.<br> Yes, yes, Grandfather, I explained that.<br> Tell the lady that I know some hotels<br> don't want to take dogs, cats or monkeys.<br> And some don't even solicit the patronage<br> of infants in their late 90s.<br> But assure her...<br> ...that if she'll forgive my<br> disgraceful longevity...<br> ...and this temporary decrepitude...<br> ...I will present her with the last signed<br> copy of my first volume of verse.<br> Published in... When, Hannah?<br> The day that President William McKinley<br> was assassinated, Nonno.<br> My grandfather is the poet<br> Jonathan Coffin.<br> He is 97 years young.<br> And he will be 98 years young...<br> ...on the 5th of October.<br> - Old folks are remarkable.<br> Hey, the phone!<br> Did you cancel that call?<br> When the hell did I have time?<br> Did I talk too much?<br> Have I been talking too much again?<br> I'm afraid that he has.<br> I don't think she's going to take us.<br> Her eyes said "no"<br> in big blue capital letters.<br> Oh, I shouldn't worry about that.<br> She'll take you in, all right.<br> The Judge Truman Fellowes<br> on the telephone.<br> Must be old butch's brother.<br> Wouldn't have a husband.<br> Anyway, I said she'd checked out,<br> canceled the call.<br> Maxine, you're larger than life.<br> Shall we register now?<br> You can register<br> any time you want.<br> But I gotta collect 6 dollars<br> from you right now...<br> ...if you want your name in the pot.<br> Six dollars.<br> Three dollars each.<br> You see, out of season like this...<br> ...we operate on the modified<br> American plan.<br> Oh, I see. Yes, well...<br> ...we usually operate on a<br> special basis ourselves.<br> What do you mean, operate?<br> Here is our card.<br> I think you may have heard of us.<br> We've had quite a few write-ups.<br> My grandfather is the oldest living<br> and practicing poet.<br> And he gives recitations.<br> I paint watercolors<br> and I'm a quick sketch artist.<br> We travel together<br> and we pay our way as we go...<br> ...by my grandfather's recitations...<br> ...and by the sale of quick character<br> sketches in charcoal and pastel.<br> I usually pass among the tables<br> during lunch and dinner, slowly.<br> I wear an artist's smock...<br> ...picturesquely dabbed with paint.<br> I don't push myself on people.<br> I just display my work.<br> And I smile sweetly at them,<br> and if invited to do so...<br> ...I sit down and make<br> a quick character sketch.<br> And Gramps?<br> I introduce him as the world's oldest<br> living and practicing poet.<br> If invited, he gives a recitation<br> of one of his poems.<br> Of course, they were all written<br> a very long time ago...<br> ...but do you know<br> he has started a new poem?<br> For the first time in 20 years<br> he has started another poem.<br> Hasn't finished it yet.<br> He still has his inspiration but his power<br> of concentration has weakened a little.<br> Right now, Gramps<br> ain't concentrating at all.<br> He's just catching forty winks.<br> Gramps.<br> Gramps.<br> Time to hit the sack, Gramps.<br> - Now, you just wait a minute.<br> - Please.<br> We've tried every hotel<br> in Puerto Vallarta.<br> They wouldn't take us.<br> I'm afraid I have to place myself<br> at your mercy.<br> Okay. Looks like you're in<br> for one night, but just one.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Where's your luggage?<br> No luggage?<br> I hid it behind some palmettos at the foot<br> of the path with Grandfather's wheelchair.<br> Pepe.<br> They're chasing an iguana.<br> What will they do with it?<br> Tie him up, fatten him up<br> and eat him up.<br> Pepe.<br> Okay, honey. You and Gramps<br> can have bungalow nine.<br> How's Gramps gonna get meals?<br> Let them have that suite.<br> Wait a minute, Shannon,<br> that's the deluxe suite.<br> I know, Maxine, generosity<br> is the cornerstone of your nature.<br> Come on, Gramps.<br> Time to move.<br> That's it.<br> Did someone call for a recitation?<br> No, Nonno,<br> we're just going to our rooms.<br> I'm dreadfully afraid<br> my grandfather had a slight stroke...<br> ...in those high passes<br> through the Sierras.<br> Old people have them. They're not regular<br> strokes, just little cerebral incidents.<br> Symptoms clear up so quickly, sometimes<br> old people don't realize they've had them.<br> Just rest for a few moments, Nonno.<br> How calmly does the olive branch<br> Observe the sky begin to blanch<br> Without a cry, without a prayer<br> With no betrayal of despair<br> I'll leave Nonno in here<br> and I'll take that room.<br> That's the one with the leaky roof,<br> but you won't find out about it...<br> ...until it rains, and then it'll be too late<br> to do anything except swim out if it.<br> - Oh, no, Mr...?<br> - Shannon, the Reverend T. Lawrence.<br> Mr. Shannon,<br> I'll find a dry spot if it rains.<br> How many...?<br> How many times have you<br> been around the world?<br> As many times as the world<br> has been around the sun.<br> And I feel as if I've gone<br> the whole way on foot.<br> Thank you, Mr. Shannon.<br> Operator.<br> Operator, aqui parlar English?<br> - Si, senora. Can I help you?<br> - This is Miss Fellowes at Mismaloya.<br> - Si, senora.<br> - What happened to my call to Texas?<br> - Where in Texas?<br> - Corpus Christi.<br> - I thought you'd checked out.<br> - Checked out?<br> How could I check out?<br> He's got the distributor...<br> Operator, you put that<br> call through again...<br> ...and I will hold the line<br> and wait if it takes all afternoon.<br> Very well, senora.<br> Seducer.<br> - What?<br> - Seducer.<br> - Now, what's the squawk now?<br> - Oh, Larry, why didn't you tell me?<br> Tell you what? What is this?<br> - You've been exposed, Shannon.<br> - Your whole shameful past.<br> Posing as a minister of the gospel.<br> I am a minister. Anybody who says I'm not...<br> Honey, show them that gold cross,<br> that'll prove it.<br> You thought you outwitted me, didn't you,<br> having your paramour here cancel my call.<br> Miss Fellowes, honey,<br> if paramour means what I think it does...<br> ...you're gambling with your front teeth.<br> My brother has been in communication<br> with Blake's Tours.<br> They've assured him<br> that they will take action, drastic action.<br> Just what do you mean by that?<br> - I have a contract that provides...<br> - Your contract is worthless.<br> My brother is a judge.<br> And he has informed your employer<br> that they are not required to employ...<br> ...a man who makes a career<br> of seducing young girls.<br> "Seducing!"<br> Did you lead her to infer that...<br> Larry, how could you think that l...?<br> I said a career. All the way<br> from Pleasant Valley, Virginia...<br> ...to that dreadful hotel<br> that you tricked us into last night.<br> But that career is now ended.<br> The Reverend Shannon, defrocked.<br> That's a lie. A base lie.<br> I was never defrocked.<br> I was only locked out of my church.<br> Spreading a story like that is libel.<br> I could take legal action. And I will.<br> These ladies are my witnesses.<br> Repeating a story like that will get you...<br> I'll show you. I'll show you all.<br> You can't say that I was defrocked.<br> I'll show you. I'll show you.<br> Well, if you're not gonna eat him,<br> I guess I'd better see about some food.<br> What's this mess supposed to be?<br> Soup.<br> Well, it's burnt!<br> Chang...<br> ...l've warned you before.<br> I don't allow this stuff on premises,<br> even if you're on vacation.<br> You remember the time you got it<br> in the enchiladas?<br> What are you<br> gonna do with them dogfish?<br> Me do nothing. Me on vacation.<br> Pedro can fry with plenty chili,<br> make hot.<br> - Why not steam it, Mrs. Faulk?<br> - No guests allowed in the kitchen.<br> Mayn't I help?<br> Please let me.<br> I was born and bred in the fishing port<br> of Nantucket.<br> And I've cooked every kind of fish<br> that swims in the sea.<br> Except whales, but they're mammals.<br> I know what you're up to, honey.<br> You wanna make yourself useful so I'll<br> let you and old Gramps stay here free.<br> I wouldn't do anything so obvious.<br> Not with a woman of your practicality.<br> No, my wanting to help in the kitchen...<br> May I have the knife, please?<br> Machete.<br> It's just that I've noticed a certain...<br> ...animosity towards<br> Mr. Shannon among the...<br> ...ladies in his party,<br> particularly in the case of...<br> ...Miss Fellowes, and I think with<br> a soothing meal inside her...<br> ...it might soothe her spirit.<br> Miss Jelkes, honey, you're a hustler.<br> A fantastic, cool hustler.<br> You're completely broke, huh?<br> Yes, we are, completely.<br> You say that like you're proud of it.<br> I'm not proud of it,<br> or ashamed of it either.<br> It just happens to be<br> what's happened to us.<br> You know what that means?<br> No, I don't think I do.<br> It's Chinese for "No sweat."<br> Our Chinese cook says it.<br> Old Fred used to say...<br> ...that those three words<br> summed up all the wisdom of the East.<br> - Fred?<br> - My husband.<br> My late husband.<br> How lately did you lose him, Mrs. Faulk?<br> Three, almost four weeks ago.<br> Maybe it hasn't dawned on me yet,<br> old Fred being gone for good.<br> It seems like he's out fishing.<br> He was always out fishing anyhow.<br> He hardly ever opened his mouth, except<br> when he got drunk and sang songs.<br> He'd lie out in that hammock<br> and drink and sing all night long.<br> No guest ever complained either.<br> Or I'd have shown them<br> the straight way down the hill.<br> I'm sure you would.<br> I loved old Fred.<br> More than anybody would guess, the way<br> I carried on. Except Fred, he knew.<br> You see, he was 28 years older than me.<br> And we hadn't slept together in<br> I don't know when.<br> Fred used to say...<br> ...he guessed he was impotent. But if you<br> ask me, honey, he just plain lost interest.<br> What other interest did he have,<br> Mrs. Faulk?<br> Only fishing.<br> He'd catch them, throw them back in.<br> Unless they swallowed the hook,<br> we'd have them for supper.<br> Fred lived and let live.<br> When I hired them beach boys...<br> ...Fred care?<br> Did he raise hell when I started going<br> night swimming with them? Hell, no.<br> He just went night fishing all night long.<br> He must have been a remarkable man.<br> You said it.<br> People with troubles, and that's everybody,<br> used to come and spill them to old Fred.<br> And he could listen forever.<br> He was better than any head shrinker...<br> ...because he knew what was<br> bugging you even before you told him.<br> That's why Shannon always made for<br> Mismaloya when he was spooked.<br> I remember one time, he came down here<br> out of season like now.<br> And I went on the make for him.<br> But Shannon wasn't having any,<br> on account of his friendship with Fred.<br> Well, they're all ready for steaming.<br> So was I, Miss Jelkes, honey, so was I.<br> But I couldn't tell him<br> that Fred didn't give a damn.<br> It didn't seem fair to Fred.<br> You know I think you're quite a<br> remarkable person too, Mrs. Faulk.<br> Don't you try to con me, honey.<br> I understand me.<br> I still got my biological urges.<br> The beach boys?<br> Yup.<br> But even I know the difference<br> between loving somebody...<br> ...and just going to bed with them.<br> Even I know that.<br> Nelly was a lady<br> Last night she died<br> Toll the bell<br> For lovely Nell<br> My dark Virginny bride<br> Don't you step in this room.<br> Don't step over that threshold.<br> Don't complicate my life. I've got a fever.<br> Don't complicate my fever.<br> Larry, watch out.<br> You're walking on broken glass.<br> - Never mind.<br> - Stand still.<br> You're cutting your feet,<br> leaving blood stains on the floor.<br> - Who saw you come in here?<br> - Nobody but an iguana.<br> - Your guardian angel will be in full cry.<br> - Let her howl.<br> I hate her and I hate that little snitch<br> of a bitch that ruined you in Virginia.<br> You're ruining me in Mexico.<br> Get off your knees, it's indecent.<br> Sit down over there. I want to<br> explain something to you. Look and listen.<br> A man has got just so much<br> in his emotional bank balance.<br> But mine has run out.<br> It's stone dry.<br> I can't draw a check on it now.<br> There's nothing left to draw out.<br> Oh, Lord, you've got blood stains on it.<br> I'm sorry to tell you<br> that you're as dangerous...<br> ...as you are young and lovely.<br> And it's your being young and lovely<br> that makes you so dangerous.<br> And that gives you this destructive<br> potential over a destructible man.<br> We're not going back.<br> We'll stay here together.<br> Live here, be beachcombers like<br> Fletcher Christian and that native girl.<br> Living in the sun.<br> You're going to marry me, Larry.<br> Oh, Lord, no, no.<br> And nothing could be worse<br> for a girl in your unstable condition...<br> ...to be mixed up with a man<br> in my unstable condition.<br> Because two people<br> in unstable conditions...<br> ...are like two countries<br> facing each other in unstable conditions.<br> The destructive potential could blow<br> the whole world to bits...<br> ...past all repair.<br> You're walking barefoot on glass.<br> I would walk on brimstone through hell...<br> ...to get you out of my room.<br> Now will you get out of my room.<br> I don't believe you don't love me.<br> I love...<br> I love nobody.<br> I know it's practically impossible<br> for anybody to realize they're not loved...<br> ...when in love with somebody<br> they think they're in love with.<br> You couldn't walk barefoot on glass<br> if you didn't love me.<br> I'm walking barefoot on glass<br> because you won't leave me alone.<br> All right, I'll do it too. I'll walk on glass<br> and I'll bleed to death with you.<br> No, you won't do this. You will get<br> out of my room and out of my life.<br> No, put me down. No!<br> You will not come near me again,<br> understand?<br> Put me down. I hate you!<br> You've ruined my life.<br> You've killed me, killed me!<br> Put me down!<br> What is this, Mr. Shannon?<br> Hell and damnation.<br> Your feet are bleeding.<br> There's glass all over the floor<br> in my room.<br> Sit down. I have antiseptics<br> and surgical gauze in my room.<br> Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.<br> That word "fantastic" seems to be<br> your favorite word, Mr. Shannon.<br> Miss Jelkes...<br> ...we live on two levels.<br> Just two?<br> The fantastic level and the realistic level<br> are the two levels upon which we live.<br> But which is the real one really?<br> I would say both, Mr. Shannon.<br> But when you live<br> on the fantastic level...<br> ...as I have more and more lately,<br> but have to operate on the realistic level...<br> ...that's when you get spooked.<br> And I am spooked, Miss Jelkes.<br> A chronicle no longer gold<br> A bargaining with mist of gold<br> There.<br> Now I'll go and clear up<br> the broken glass in your room.<br> Don't bother about that. If you'd be<br> kind enough to bring my shoes...<br> ...and could you let me have<br> my clerical collar? It's on the floor.<br> Are you planning to conduct a church<br> service here tonight, Mr. Shannon?<br> No, I just plan to do...<br> ...nothing.<br> Oh, and bring me that distributor head,<br> if you would.<br> This?<br> That's it.<br> If you're not going to conduct a service,<br> why get into this uncomfortable outfit?<br> Because I've been accused of being<br> defrocked and lying about it, that's why.<br> I will demonstrate to these ladies that<br> I'm still a frocked minister of the gospel.<br> I'm afraid it's no use, Mr. Shannon.<br> The neckband's so frayed,<br> it won't hold the collar button.<br> - Oh, damn.<br> - Hannah!<br> Oh, God, he's fallen.<br> Hey, Grandpa.<br> There you are.<br> I wish my pulse were as steady as his.<br> Did you feel dizzy, Grandfather?<br> No, no.<br> I was working on my new poem and...<br> Where's my cane?<br> There you are, Grandpa.<br> I was beating time with my cane<br> and my cane slipped.<br> You'd better rest a while.<br> Yes.<br> Rest a while.<br> He'll be all right now,<br> we can talk outside.<br> Why are you breathing like that?<br> Some people take a drink...<br> ...others take a pill.<br> I just take a few deep breaths.<br> Well...<br> ...don't be frightened about it.<br> He was amazing, just amazing...<br> ...until he started having these little,<br> whatever they are, these spells.<br> When they started, I...<br> ...tried to persuade him to go back to<br> Nantucket but he said, "No. Mexico."<br> So Mexico it is.<br> And he wouldn't rest anywhere,<br> until he got to the sea.<br> "The cradle of life," as he calls it.<br> So here we are, Mr. Shannon.<br> Like a couple of scarecrows<br> on this windy hilltop...<br> ...over the cradle of life.<br> The plummeting to earth and then...<br> Hannah? Hannah?<br> - Yes, Grandfather?<br> - I'm pretty sure I'm gonna finish it here.<br> I have the same feeling myself,<br> Grandpa.<br> I've never been surer of anything<br> in my life.<br> I've never been surer of anything<br> in mine, either.<br> Of course, you'll finish the poem.<br> Why, it's nearly finished already.<br> I'll be outside if you want me<br> to write something down.<br> He'll probably sleep a while now.<br> Miss Jelkes, may l...?<br> May I have one of your cigarettes?<br> You must never smoke those.<br> They're made out of cigarette ends<br> taken out of the gutters.<br> Have one of mine.<br> English, imported, in an airtight tin.<br> It's my one luxury in life.<br> Yes, thank you, I will,<br> since you've thrown mine away.<br> Well...<br> ...l'm going to tell you something<br> about yourself, Miss Jelkes.<br> You are a lady,<br> a real one and a great one.<br> What have I done to merit<br> that compliment from you?<br> Well, you took out your cigarettes,<br> found out you only had two left.<br> You can't afford to buy another pack<br> of even that cheap brand...<br> ...and so you put them away for later,<br> right?<br> Mercilessly accurate, Mr. Shannon.<br> But when I asked you for one, you gave<br> me it without slightest sign of reluctance.<br> I think you're making a big point<br> out of a small matter.<br> Oh, no, no.<br> I'm making a small point<br> out of a very, very large matter.<br> How long have you been inactive<br> in the church, Mr. Shannon?<br> What's that got to do<br> with the price of rice in China?<br> - Nothing.<br> - And what's it got to do...<br> ...with the price of coffee in Brazil?<br> I retract the question, with apologies.<br> Very well, then,<br> I'll be glad to answer it. I...<br> I have been inactive<br> in the church for all but one year...<br> ...since I was ordained<br> a minister of the church.<br> That's quite a sabbatical, Mr. Shannon.<br> Yes, I had one parish for one year<br> and then...<br> ...I was not defrocked...<br> ...I was locked out of the church.<br> Are you...? You drawing me?<br> I'm trying to.<br> Why did they lock you out?<br> For fornication and conduct<br> unbecoming a man of the cloth.<br> What were the circumstances<br> of the first offense?<br> Fornication?<br> A very young Sunday school teacher asked<br> to see me, privately, in my study and...<br> ...well, she...<br> She declared herself<br> to me, wildly.<br> A declaration of love?<br> Don't make fun of me, Miss Jelkes.<br> I wasn't.<br> I was the damnedest prig<br> in those days that you can imagine.<br> I said to this girl, I said,<br> "Let us kneel down and pray together."<br> And we did, we knelt.<br> And then all of sudden, the...<br> ...kneeling position turned<br> into a reclining position.<br> The next day, she cut herself with<br> her father's straight blade razor.<br> - Fatally?<br> - No, no, no.<br> Thanks to a Band-Aid.<br> But it made a scandal.<br> Yes, I imagine that it<br> caused some comment.<br> Yes, it did, it did that.<br> The next Sunday when I saw those smug,<br> accusing, disapproving faces uplifted...<br> ...I had a sudden urge to shock.<br> And I shocked them.<br> I chased them out of the church.<br> And what was the upshot of it?<br> They put me in a nice little private<br> asylum to recover from...<br> ...a complete nervous breakdown.<br> That's the way they put it.<br> And then when I got out I...<br> I entered this line.<br> "Tours of God's world,<br> conducted by a minister of God."<br> To quote the pamphlet.<br> But on the side...<br> ...Shannon has been collecting evidence.<br> - Evidence of what?<br> - Man's inhumanity to God.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> - The pain we cause him.<br> We've poisoned his atmosphere.<br> We've slaughtered<br> his creatures of the wild.<br> We've polluted his rivers.<br> We've even taken<br> God's noblest creation, man...<br> ...and brainwashed him into becoming<br> our own product, not God's.<br> Hacked, stacked and canned.<br> Am I...?<br> Am I moving too much?<br> No, of course not.<br> Mr. Shannon?<br> What do you do if...?<br> If what?<br> If Miss Fellowes has her way?<br> And gets me fired?<br> Yes, what do you do then?<br> Well, I either go back<br> to the church, or I...<br> I take the long swim.<br> - It's right out there.<br> - What is?<br> China.<br> - Was that the luncheon gong?<br> - Chow will be ready in a half-hour.<br> How you feeling, Miss Peebles, honey?<br> A bit better?<br> - Thank you, I think I am.<br> - How about a little drink?<br> - That won't hurt you.<br> - Well...<br> You look like the den mother.<br> How about you, Miss Fellowes?<br> Thank you, we'll just sit here<br> and wait until lunch is ready.<br> Miss Fellowes, honey.<br> I know you got a beef or two.<br> But why don't you just relax<br> with a little complimentary rum-coco?<br> Save them for your friend, Mr. Shannon.<br> I don't imbibe.<br> Then how about a little pot?<br> I don't usually serve it to my guests...<br> ...but you look like<br> you need something special.<br> May I see?<br> I'm just a quick sketch artist,<br> Mr. Shannon.<br> Not very talented.<br> Are my eyes as wild as this?<br> Yes, they are, Mr. Shannon.<br> I have fever.<br> - What gives with you two?<br> - What do you mean, what gives?<br> I mean, am I butting in here?<br> Is three a crowd?<br> No, indeed, not a bit.<br> What are you covering up there?<br> Let me see.<br> What are you drawing him for?<br> He's broker than you are.<br> Perhaps you'd like to keep it,<br> Mrs. Faulk.<br> Thanks a hell of a lot, honey,<br> but one of him is enough.<br> - Who wants a drink?<br> - Nothing for me, thank you.<br> Just as well. You're in to me<br> for the rooms and meals.<br> - A little whiskey makes no difference.<br> - Lay off.<br> And you go to hell, why don't you!<br> Mr. Shannon, Mrs. Faulk.<br> This is childish.<br> Stop it at once. It's disgraceful!<br> It's disgraceful.<br> - Mrs. Faulk, you must realize...<br> - I realize you're a deadbeat.<br> Using that dying old man as a front...<br> ...to get you into places when you<br> ain't got cash for one day in advance.<br> You're dragging him around<br> like a Chinese beggar...<br> ...dragging around crippled children<br> to put the touch on the tourists.<br> I shall go into town.<br> And I shall set up my easel in the plaza...<br> ...and I shall peddle my watercolors,<br> and sketch tourists.<br> I am not a weak person, Mrs. Faulk.<br> My failure here is not typical of me.<br> - I'm not a weak person either, honey.<br> - Oh, no, indeed.<br> - Your strength is awe-inspiring.<br> - You bet your...<br> How you going into town,<br> when you ain't got cab fare?<br> I shall go on shanks' mare, Mrs. Faulk.<br> I'm Nantucket born and bred.<br> Islanders are good walkers.<br> I shall pack our things.<br> And I shall put my grandfather<br> into his wheelchair...<br> ...and push him back down this hill<br> to the road, all the way into town.<br> He would prefer that<br> to staying where he is not wanted.<br> And I would prefer it for him<br> and for myself, Mrs. Faulk.<br> All right, calm down.<br> - I am perfectly calm, Mrs. Faulk.<br> - Well, I'm not.<br> That's the trouble.<br> The trouble is Shannon.<br> - I caught the vibrations between you two.<br> - Mrs. Faulk.<br> I'm a New England spinster<br> who is pushing 40.<br> Well, who the hell isn't?<br> I'm good at catching vibrations.<br> And there were vibrations between you,<br> mutual vibrations, the minute you got here.<br> And just that, believe me, is enough<br> to put me in a lather.<br> And don't ask me why.<br> Look at him.<br> Broke, spooked, as good as fired.<br> Those are only his circumstances,<br> Mrs. Faulk...<br> ...not the man himself.<br> - Well, anyhow.<br> Forget what I said, honey.<br> I wasn't sore at you,<br> I was sore at Shannon.<br> And still the ripe fruit and the branch<br> - Observe the sky begin to blanch<br> - I'll fix old Gramps a toddy.<br> - Old folks need it, need a toddy.<br> - Without a cry...<br> That's very kind of you.<br> I'll make him a Manhattan<br> with two cherries in it.<br> So he'll live through lunch.<br> Charlotte.<br> - Charlotte!<br> - What's eating her now?<br> Charlotte. Girls! Charlotte!<br> What's the trouble now, Miss Fellowes?<br> Charlotte. Have you seen her?<br> She's disappeared.<br> Charlotte.<br> - Charlotte!<br> - Charlotte.<br> - Charlotte.<br> - Now be calm, Miss Fellowes.<br> Tell us quietly what has happened.<br> She didn't come to luncheon. Her room<br> was empty, and she's not in my room.<br> I don't know what's happened.<br> She doesn't answer.<br> - Let's find her. Charlotte.<br> - Charlotte.<br> Charlotte.<br> - More.<br> - No more.<br> No more, I say.<br> Stop it.<br> - Senorita, go home.<br> - I have no home.<br> Go home, I say.<br> Take your dollars with you.<br> I'm a rich man.<br> I do not want your dollars.<br> I do not want you dancing to my music.<br> - More music.<br> - No more music.<br> Senorita, we do not want our sons<br> to know that young girls can be like you.<br> I won't go back up there.<br> Put me down. Let me go!<br> Attaboy, Hank.<br> Give it to them!<br> Hit them.<br> Knock them down.<br> Attaboy, hit them.<br> Yeah, hit them again.<br> Yeah, give it to them, Hank.<br> Come on, hit them.<br> Come on, Hank.<br> Knock them down! Knock them out!<br> Yeah, come on, Hank, give it to them.<br> Come on, Hank!<br> Oh, Hank, you saved me.<br> You're so brave.<br> My hero. Oh, Hank, take me home.<br> I mean home.<br> I'll tell Daddy it was you who saved me.<br> Daddy, he loves me.<br> He'll do anything to thank you.<br> I wonder if any of you ladies<br> would be interested in seeing...<br> ...some samples of my work?<br> This one is entitled:<br> Moonlight Recollected by Daylight.<br> And here, here is a character sketch<br> that I did in less than five minutes.<br> The queen, when she was Princess<br> Elizabeth, on a tour of Africa years ago.<br> I couldn't get very close, of course.<br> - I had to use field glasses.<br> - No, thank you.<br> Love's an old remembered song<br> A drunken fiddler plays<br> Stumbling crazily along<br> Crooked alleyways<br> - Not now, Nonno.<br> - When his heart is mad with music<br> - He will play the...<br> - Nonno, please.<br> He thinks that someone called<br> for a recitation of one of his poems.<br> Don't you worry, honey.<br> In this crowd,<br> old Gramps is the life of the party.<br> Gramps, honey, here.<br> Finish your toddy.<br> I don't care what anybody says.<br> This fish is delicious.<br> Swing it this way.<br> I could handle another helping.<br> And no funny stuff.<br> Keep those dukes on the platter.<br> What did he say?<br> He says you're a hell of a man<br> in action against a fish...<br> ...if it's a dead fish.<br> Very funny.<br> Daddy always says the only difference<br> between a success and a failure...<br> ...is that a success knows an opportunity<br> when he sees it, and a failure doesn't.<br> Well, don't worry about me<br> recognizing an opportunity.<br> Oh, Hank. When I tell Daddy,<br> he'll be so proud of you.<br> Hannah?<br> What was the take?<br> Grandfather, please stop shouting.<br> Did they cross your palm<br> with silver or paper, Hannah?<br> Nonno, no more shouting,<br> we're having lunch.<br> Chow time, Gramps.<br> How much did they come across with?<br> He won't stop shouting.<br> Gramps. Five dollars.<br> I'm putting it in your pocket.<br> We can't accept gratuities,<br> Mr. Shannon.<br> Oh, hell, it was only pesos.<br> Yeah, we're going to clean up<br> in this place.<br> You bet we're going<br> to clean up here, Gramps.<br> If there's a cocktail lounge,<br> we ought to work that first.<br> Strike while the iron is hot.<br> While it's hot.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Speaking.<br> Anything I can do for you?<br> Who?<br> Shannon.<br> You're wanted on the blower.<br> El Paso. Person-to-person.<br> This is the moment you've awaited,<br> Miss Fellowes.<br> That will be my esteemed,<br> but not by me, employer.<br> I will now demonstrate to you<br> how a man of integrity brings an almost...<br> ...insoluble situation<br> to a triumphant conclusion.<br> The Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon<br> speaking.<br> Well, Mr. Blake, how are you?<br> Nice of you to call.<br> Wish you were down here with us.<br> The air's like spring wine down here...<br> ...at this time of year.<br> What do you mean, on the sauce?<br> You know me better than that, Mr. Blake.<br> I don't care what any<br> judge in Corpus Christi says.<br> You know and I know that I am a<br> regularly ordained minister of the gospel.<br> - Shannon, you're fired as of right now.<br> - Now, wait a minute, you big fat zero.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> A tour conductor is like<br> the captain of a ship.<br> Once the bus leaves the terminal<br> he is in sole command.<br> And let me assure you...<br> ...that Shannon runs a taut bus.<br> A very taut bus. I've taken it past...<br> ...deadly shoals and all the perils<br> of the deep.<br> Figuratively speaking, of course.<br> And I remain in command.<br> I have here in my pocket<br> the symbol of my command.<br> Right here, in my pocket.<br> You cannot fire a man<br> who has the distributor head.<br> Shannon can fire Blake's Tours...<br> ...but Blake's Tours cannot fire Shannon.<br> - This tour will end in peace and unity.<br> - You're fired, Shannon!<br> Shannon will emerge triumphant.<br> Well, Hank, aren't you proud of me?<br> As a member of my crew...<br> ...aren't you proud of me?<br> Hank, you know that... That shiner<br> gives you character, Hank.<br> Hey, lay off, you big baboon.<br> I got it. I got it, I got it. I got it!<br> That's to show how I hate you.<br> I hate you.<br> Foe. I thought you were my friend<br> and you turned out to be my foe. Foe.<br> You're all through, Reverend.<br> You've had it.<br> Relax, baby. The party's over.<br> Okay, folks, let's get cracking.<br> Get your duds together, we're<br> ready to blow this goat shed.<br> - Goat shed?<br> - Come on, I'll help you get packed.<br> You got rooms in Puerto Vallarta.<br> I'll have you there in 20 minutes.<br> From now on, this tour is gonna be<br> conducted like a respectable tour.<br> Respectable? Why these ladies have had,<br> some of them...<br> ...most of them, if not all of them,<br> for the first time in their lives...<br> ...contact, social contact, with a<br> gentleman born and bred...<br> ...whom under no other circumstances<br> could they possibly have met.<br> The son of a clergyman<br> and the grandson of two bishops.<br> Churchmen on both sides<br> of the family.<br> - How's old Gramps doing?<br> - He's sleeping just now.<br> Through that riot?<br> Will Mr. Shannon be all right,<br> do you think?<br> All right? Honey, I don't know.<br> He cracks up like this so regular,<br> you can set a calendar by it.<br> About twice a year.<br> He's done it twice down here.<br> Fred used to say it had something to do<br> with the moon.<br> I sure wish old Fred was here right now.<br> Oh, my God!<br> - What is it, Mrs. Faulk?<br> - Honey, I advise you not to look.<br> Just take my word for it.<br> Old Shannon is out-Shannoning Shannon.<br> Shannon, you beast. You beast.<br> You, you... You unutterable beast!<br> Did you see what he did?<br> All right, ladies, now keep calm.<br> Keep calm, ladies. Just follow me.<br> Follow me down the hill.<br> Make sure you get my bag.<br> Shannon.<br> You've avenged yourself for<br> all time on Miss Fellowes' suitcase.<br> I've heard of a dog cocking his leg.<br> Why don't you buzz off<br> on your broomstick?<br> I'm not talking to you.<br> I'm talking to him.<br> I'm going to have you blacklisted<br> in every travel agency in America.<br> What about Africa, Tasmania,<br> Bechuanaland, Tonmawr?<br> Please, Miss Fellowes, leave him alone.<br> As soon as I get back, I'm gonna swear<br> out a warrant for your arrest.<br> Molesting a minor, kidnapping,<br> malicious damage to private property.<br> Indecent exposure.<br> What subject do you teach<br> back in that college of yours, honey?<br> - Voice, if that's got anything to do with it.<br> - Well, geography's my speciality.<br> Did you know that if it wasn't for<br> the dykes...<br> ...the plains of Texas would be engulfed<br> by the Gulf?<br> Maxine.<br> Let's level a while, butch, old gal.<br> Do you know what you're sore about,<br> really sore about?<br> That little quail of yours<br> has a natural preference for men instead of...<br> Maxine!<br> What is she talking about?<br> You'd better go now, Miss Fellowes.<br> The party's over.<br> Right now, I'm no longer<br> in a position to...<br> ...discharge my responsibility<br> of protecting you.<br> Responsibility from which<br> you discharged me.<br> Just go, Miss Fellowes.<br> Just go.<br> What did you shut me up for?<br> It's time somebody told that old dame off.<br> Miss Fellowes is a highly moral person.<br> And if she ever recognized the truth<br> about herself, it would destroy her.<br> Well, she's done a pretty good job<br> of destroying you.<br> Maxine.<br> Don't rob me of the credit<br> for my own small accomplishments.<br> Jehoshaphat, the bill!<br> They haven't paid the cotton-picking bill!<br> All right, ladies, take your seats,<br> we'll be out of here.<br> I don't know, I kind of hate to leave<br> this nice place.<br> Peebie.<br> - Charlotte, you get in next.<br> - Climb in, Miss Fellowes.<br> Charlotte's sitting up front with me.<br> Hey!<br> Just a flipping minute.<br> - What is it now?<br> - 300 pesos, that's what it is now.<br> - Twenty-four dollars.<br> - What about my suitcase?<br> Miss Fellowes, honey,<br> you ain't gonna blame that on me.<br> I blame your tout that brought us<br> here. Collect the money from him.<br> Miss Fellowes, you've been doing a lot of<br> complaining about the food on this trip.<br> You figure you're gonna do any better<br> in a Mexican jail?<br> - Attagirl.<br> - One, two, three.<br> And watch out for the fleas<br> at the Ambos Mundos.<br> All you have to do is sponge down<br> with a little kerosene.<br> The manager keeps a big supply<br> right in the lobby.<br> There go your ladies, Mr. Shannon.<br> The spook's triumphant.<br> He's won his point.<br> He's proved there's no place<br> for Shannon...<br> ...on the realistic level.<br> The last thin thread<br> that bound him there...<br> ...is broken.<br> Now, Lord...<br> ...letteth thy servant...<br> ...depart in peace.<br> Mr. Shannon, stop that.<br> You're cutting yourself doing that.<br> Here. Please. Let me help.<br> - Let me take it off.<br> - I've got to break the chain.<br> No, no, no. Now, wait. Wait.<br> There.<br> There, I have it.<br> Thank you.<br> It's yours. You keep it.<br> Where are you going?<br> The long swim. To China.<br> Mrs. Faulk, stop him.<br> Mrs. Faulk.<br> Mrs. Faulk, stop him.<br> You must stop him. Please stop him.<br> Knock him out if you have to.<br> Hang one on him.<br> Baby.<br> You've got the daddy of all spooks.<br> This is a blue plate special.<br> - Let me out of here!<br> - You lie doggone now. Quiet down.<br> You know and I know that half this show<br> you're putting on...<br> ...is playacting. Only trouble is,<br> sharks don't know that.<br> Let me loose.<br> Honey, you scared me out of seven years'<br> growth tonight, you ain't gonna do it again.<br> Mrs. Faulk?<br> I wonder if you'd mind<br> making a pot of this tea?<br> Miss Jelkes, does this strike you<br> as the right time for a tea party?<br> But this isn't ordinary tea. It's poppy<br> seed tea. It has a very calming effect.<br> Let me go!<br> - Tea, it's a hell of a solution.<br> - Please believe me, Mrs. Faulk.<br> I've had experience of someone<br> in Mr. Shannon's condition.<br> And I do know whereof I speak.<br> Untie me!<br> Poppy seed makes a mild<br> sedative drink...<br> ...that helps you get through nights<br> that are hard for you to get through.<br> We could all use some tonight.<br> Because for all of us...<br> ...you, me, my grandfather...<br> ...this won't be an easy night<br> to get through.<br> Without a cry, without a prayer<br> - With no betrayal of despair<br> - Untie me.<br> - Not yet.<br> - I'm panicking.<br> - I know.<br> - A man can die of panic.<br> Not when he enjoys it as much<br> as you do, Mr. Shannon.<br> What do you mean by that insult?<br> You think I like being tied in this hammock,<br> trussed up like a hog in a slaughterhouse?<br> No, who wouldn't like to atone<br> for the sins of themselves...<br> ...and the world if it could be<br> done in a hammock with ropes...<br> ...instead of on a cross with nails?<br> On a green hilltop...<br> ...instead of on Golgotha,<br> the place of the skulls.<br> Isn't that a comparatively<br> comfortable...<br> ...almost voluptuous crucifixion to suffer<br> for the sins of the world, Mr. Shannon?<br> - Why have you turned against me?<br> - I haven't turned against you.<br> Thought you were sexless, but you've<br> suddenly turned into a woman.<br> You know how I know that?<br> Because you, not me, are taking<br> pleasure in my being tied up.<br> All women, whether they want<br> to face it or not...<br> ...want to see a man<br> in a tied-up situation.<br> They spend their lives trying to get a man<br> into a tied-up situation.<br> Their lives are fulfilled when<br> they get as many men as they can...<br> ...into a tied-up situation.<br> I'd like to untie you right now,<br> but I can't.<br> You believe in people being tied up?<br> Only when they might take<br> the long swim to China.<br> The long swim to China...<br> Shannon!<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - Stop.<br> Stop it. Stop it, Shannon.<br> I'm gonna call Dr. Lopez.<br> And I'm gonna have you carted off<br> to the Casa de Locos.<br> - And you'll be put in a cell, alone!<br> - Off, off!<br> With hay on the floor and a bucket.<br> And that's all!<br> Off! Off! Off!<br> Off!<br> - Here, Mr. Shannon, drink this.<br> - Untie me!<br> You can holler<br> and howl to your heart's content...<br> ...in the Casa de Locos.<br> All day and all night.<br> I'm a citizen with inalienable rights. Get<br> me the consul. I demand to see the consul!<br> Please, Mr. Shannon,<br> drink this poppy seed tea.<br> How can I with the widow Faulk<br> sitting on me?<br> Here, give me that tea. I made it.<br> I'll give it to him.<br> Drink this, you buzzard!<br> It's scalding.<br> Thank you, Maxine.<br> That's all I needed.<br> To have my mouth burned raw.<br> Now, if you could put some splinters<br> of bamboo under my fingernails...<br> ...and have my eyelids cut off...<br> - Mrs. Faulk, let me.<br> Okay, honey.<br> You take over completely.<br> He's entirely yours.<br> May I make a further suggestion,<br> Maxine?<br> Why don't you go moonlight bathing<br> with your beach boys.<br> Don't let my presence stop you, any more<br> than old Fred's presence used to stop you.<br> You bastard!<br> Pepe.<br> Pedro.<br> You no-good bastard!<br> That was cruel, Mr. Shannon.<br> Childishly cruel.<br> I can't stand for a person I respect<br> to behave like a small, cruel boy.<br> Now, what do you respect in me,<br> Miss Thin-Standing-Up-Female-Buddha?<br> I respect anybody who has had to...<br> ...fight and howl for his decency.<br> - What decency?<br> - Yes. His decency.<br> And his...<br> His bit of goodness.<br> Far more than I respect<br> those lucky ones who've...<br> ...had theirs handed out to them at birth...<br> ...and never afterwards snatched<br> away from them by unbearable torments.<br> A chronicle no longer gold<br> A bargaining with mist and mold<br> Listen to him,<br> saying them over and over.<br> The lines of his new poem.<br> Like a blind man climbing a staircase<br> that leads nowhere.<br> Should you be in there<br> helping him?<br> He'll call me when he needs me.<br> Drink this, Mr. Shannon.<br> I have no right to ask the question...<br> ...but why did you go to such lengths<br> to protect Miss Fellowes...<br> ...for whom you have no high regard...<br> ...and to equal lengths to hurt Mrs. Faulk,<br> for whom you have?<br> Maxine's indestructible.<br> Is she?<br> Or does she just give that impression?<br> The only impression Maxine<br> gives is herself. Maxine's Maxine.<br> And I'm a no-good bastard.<br> Lay it to the drink. I'm a bad drunk.<br> You were drunk when you came<br> to Miss Fellowes' rescue.<br> I got drunker.<br> Drink isn't your problem, Mr. Shannon.<br> And what is my problem, Miss Jelkes?<br> The oldest one in the world.<br> The need to believe in someone,<br> or something.<br> Almost anyone. Almost anything.<br> - Your voice sounds hopeless about it.<br> - Oh, no, I'm not hopeless about it.<br> In fact, I've...<br> I've discovered something to believe in.<br> What?<br> Broken barriers between people.<br> A wanting to help each other.<br> Through nights like this.<br> One-night stands.<br> One-night communications<br> between them.<br> On a veranda...<br> ...outside their separate cubicles.<br> You don't mean physically, do you?<br> - No.<br> - I didn't think you did.<br> An intercourse not well-designed<br> For beings of a golden kind<br> Whose native green must arch above<br> The earth's obscene, corrupting love<br> Is that what you advocate for me?<br> Is that what you call a human<br> relationship, you and Grandpa there?<br> Yes, Mr. Shannon. Yes. Yes, I do.<br> We make a home for each other,<br> my grandfather and I.<br> Oh, I don't mean a regular home,<br> because...<br> ...I don't regard a home as a...<br> As a place, a building...<br> ...bricks, wood, stone.<br> I think of a home...<br> ...as something two people have<br> between them.<br> In which each can...<br> ...nest, rest...<br> ...live in, emotionally speaking.<br> Does that make any sense to you,<br> Mr. Shannon?<br> Yes, but...<br> Well, go on. But what?<br> Oh, leave it, I'd only say something<br> to hurt you.<br> I'm not thin-skinned, Mr. Shannon.<br> Very well. When a bird builds a nest<br> to rest in and live in...<br> ...he doesn't build it in a falling-down tree.<br> - I'm not a bird, Mr. Shannon.<br> He builds with an eye to the permanence<br> of the location, and for the purpose of...<br> ...mating and propagating the species.<br> I still say I'm not a bird, Mr. Shannon.<br> I'm a human being.<br> And when one of that unique species...<br> ...builds its nest in the heart of another...<br> ...the questions of permanence<br> and propagation...<br> ...aren't the first, or even<br> the last things to be considered.<br> What is important...<br> ...is that one is never alone.<br> You've been asking all the questions,<br> Miss Jelkes. May I ask one of you?<br> Ask it. There's no limit on questions<br> here tonight.<br> And on answers?<br> None that I can think of, Mr. Shannon,<br> between you and me.<br> This, then, is the question.<br> Have you never in your life<br> had any kind of...<br> ...love life?<br> Would you mind repeating the question?<br> Have you never in your life or travels<br> had any encounter with any experience of...<br> ...what Larry the Crackpot<br> would describe as a love life?<br> There are worse things than chastity,<br> Mr. Shannon.<br> Yes, lunacy and death.<br> Well, if you don't want to answer<br> the question...<br> No, no, I don't mind answering.<br> Yes.<br> Yes. I have had two experiences...<br> Well, encounters with.<br> Two.<br> Yes, I said two.<br> When I was 16.<br> Sixteen.<br> Yes, 16.<br> When I was 16...<br> ...every Saturday I would go<br> to the Saturday matinee...<br> ...at the Nantucket Movie Theater.<br> That was soon after my parents were<br> killed in an automobile accident...<br> ...and I was very alone.<br> Well, one day a young man...<br> ...sat down beside me<br> and pushed his knee against mine.<br> I moved over but he moved over too,<br> and continued the pressure.<br> I jumped up and screamed...<br> ...and he was arrested<br> for molesting a minor.<br> Is he still in the Nantucket jail?<br> No. No, I got him out.<br> I told the police it was a Garbo picture.<br> It was a Garbo picture.<br> And that I was just overexcited.<br> And the second?<br> The second experience<br> is much more recent.<br> Only four years ago,<br> when Nonno and I were in Hong Kong.<br> One evening...<br> ...in the Palm Court of Cliff Hotel...<br> ...we met this middle-aged, sort of...<br> ...nondescript Australian salesman.<br> You know, plump, bald, spotted,<br> and terribly over-friendly.<br> I did a sketch of him<br> that was shamelessly flattering...<br> ...for which he paid me<br> more than my usual price.<br> Ten Malayan dollars.<br> Then, he asked me out<br> in a sampan with him.<br> Well, he'd been so generous...<br> ...I accepted.<br> I did.<br> I accepted.<br> Grandfather went up to bed.<br> And I went out in the sampan...<br> ...with the Aussie underwear salesman.<br> I noticed he became more and more...<br> What?<br> Agitated.<br> Well, finally, he leant towards me.<br> We were vis-a-vis in the sampan.<br> And he looked intensely and passionately<br> into my eyes and said:<br> "Miss Jelkes, would you do me a favor?<br> Would you do something for me?"<br> "What?" I asked.<br> "Well," he said:<br> "If I turn my back...<br> ...if I look the other way...<br> ...will you take off some piece<br> of your clothing and let me hold it?<br> Just hold it."<br> And what did you do in this situation?<br> I did as he asked.<br> And he kept his promise.<br> He kept his back turned<br> until I said "Ready"...<br> ...and threw him the piece of my clothing.<br> But what did he do with it?<br> I don't know.<br> I looked the other way.<br> - And that experience, you call that a...?<br> - A love experience?<br> Yes, I do, Mr. Shannon.<br> That sad little, dirty little episode,<br> you call it a...<br> Sad, it certainly was for the poor little<br> man. But why do you call it dirty?<br> You mean<br> you weren't disgusted by it?<br> Nothing human disgusts me,<br> Mr. Shannon.<br> Unless it's unkind or violent.<br> And I told you how...<br> How gentle he was.<br> Apologetic, shy.<br> And really very...<br> ...well...<br> ...delicate about it.<br> However, I do grant you<br> that it was rather on the fantastic level.<br> What are you doing?<br> Untying you.<br> Why? Why now?<br> I think the spook is exorcised, Mr. Shannon.<br> You've ceased to struggle.<br> And acceptance of life is surely<br> the first requisite for living it.<br> Who was the person you told Maxine<br> you'd helped through a crackup like this?<br> Oh, that.<br> Myself.<br> Oh. Oh, you?<br> Oh, yes.<br> I had a spook like yours once.<br> I just had a different name for him.<br> I used to call him the "blue devil."<br> - And we had quite a contest between us.<br> - Which you...<br> Which you won.<br> I couldn't afford to lose.<br> How did you...?<br> How did you beat this blue devil of yours?<br> I showed him I could endure him.<br> - And made him respect my endurance.<br> - How?<br> Just by enduring.<br> Endurance is something that spooks<br> and blue devils respect.<br> And they respect all the tricks...<br> ...that panicky people use to outwit<br> and outlast their panic.<br> Like taking a few deep,<br> deep breaths?<br> Or rum-cocos.<br> Or even beach boys.<br> Anything. Everything we do<br> to give them the slip.<br> So keep on going.<br> To where?<br> To somewhere like this, perhaps.<br> After long and difficult travels...<br> ...the subterranean travels<br> that the spooked and bedeviled take...<br> ...through the unlighted sides of<br> their own natures until finally...<br> ...they see a faint gray light.<br> And keep climbing towards it.<br> Are you still following<br> that faint gray light?<br> Any light is a good light to see by<br> at the end of a long, dark tunnel...<br> ...that you thought would be<br> never-ending.<br> That only God or death<br> could put a stop to.<br> Especially when you...<br> Since I was<br> far from sure about God.<br> Are you still unsure about him?<br> Not as unsure as I was.<br> He's still struggling.<br> Yes. He's got to the end of his rope.<br> And any further, he cannot get.<br> Can you honestly tell me<br> that he is not able to feel pain and panic?<br> - You mean, he's one of God's creatures?<br> - Yes, if you want to put it that way.<br> Mr. Shannon, cut him loose.<br> All right.<br> We'll play God tonight, like kids play houses<br> with old broken crates and boxes.<br> We'll cut the lizard loose<br> so that he can go back to his bushes.<br> Because God won't do it<br> and we are playing God here tonight.<br> Mr. Shannon.<br> I knew you'd do that.<br> What the hell are you doing, Shannon?<br> I just cut loose one of God's creatures<br> at the end of his rope.<br> What for?<br> So that one of God's creatures<br> could be free from panic...<br> ...and scamper home safe and free.<br> A little act of grace, Maxine.<br> Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!<br> Where are you?<br> Here, Grandfather.<br> Right here.<br> It finished! Quick, before I forget it,<br> pencil and paper. Hurry, please!<br> - Ready?<br> - Yes. All ready, Grandfather.<br> How calmly does the olive branch<br> Observe the sky begin to blanch<br> Without a cry, without a prayer<br> With no betrayal of despair<br> Some time while night obscures the tree<br> The zenith of its life will be<br> Gone past forever<br> And from thence<br> A second history will commence<br> A chronicle no longer gold<br> A bargaining with mist and mold<br> And finally, the broken stem<br> The plummeting to earth<br> And then, an intercourse<br> Not well designed for beings<br> Of a golden kind<br> Whose native green must arch above<br> The earth's obscene, corrupting love<br> And still the ripe fruit and the branch<br> Observe the sky begin to blanch<br> Without a cry, without a prayer<br> With no betrayal of despair<br> Oh, courage<br> Could you not as well<br> Select a second place to dwell<br> Not only in that golden tree<br> But in the frightened heart of me?<br> Have you got that, Hannah?<br> Yes, Grandfather.<br> - All of it?<br> - Every word.<br> - And it's finished?<br> - Yes.<br> - Finally finished?<br> - Yes, finally finished.<br> And it's good.<br> Beautiful.<br> - Is it good?<br> - Beautiful, Grandfather.<br> Oh, Grandfather, I'm so happy for you.<br> Thank you for writing such a lovely poem.<br> It was worth the long wait.<br> Can you sleep a little now?<br> I'll fetch your shawl.<br> I'd like to pray now.<br> Oh, God.<br> Please can't we stop now?<br> He won't need the shawl.<br> God has played God<br> and set him free.<br> Oh, courage<br> Could you not as well<br> Have found a second place to dwell<br> Not only in that golden tree<br> But in the frightened heart of me?<br> Miss Jelkes.<br> What are you doing?<br> You're not gonna leave us today, are you?<br> There's no reason to delay.<br> Everything has been done.<br> Thanks to your kindness<br> and Mrs. Faulk's...<br> ...Dr. Lopez and all the good people<br> in the village.<br> I know now why he insisted<br> we go on with this trip.<br> He knew it was the end.<br> And he wanted it to come where he could<br> be buried peacefully on a green hilltop...<br> ...within sight and sound of the sea,<br> his "cradle of life."<br> - You're going on, are you?<br> - Yes, naturally.<br> - Where?<br> - Well, first I shall go into town...<br> ...and try my luck in the plaza.<br> What luck do you expect in the plaza?<br> Do you expect the old lady selling tacos<br> to buy your sketches like hotcakes?<br> There'll be some tourists, and I shall give<br> them what is known as the "hard sell."<br> Miss Jelkes, you're not operating<br> on the realistic level.<br> Yes, I am. We are operating<br> on a realistic level...<br> ...when we are doing the things<br> that have to be done.<br> But you can't go on alone. Think of how<br> it will feel after so many years.<br> I shall know how it feels when I feel it.<br> Miss Jelkes, I wonder...<br> Yes. What do you wonder?<br> Well, I was wondering...<br> ...if it was possible for us<br> to travel together.<br> I mean, travel together.<br> Do you really think we could?<br> I don't see why not,<br> both of us sort of at loose ends.<br> I feel sure the impracticality of it<br> would be all too clear to you later.<br> I think it would only prove awkward<br> and embarrassing for both of us.<br> - Miss Jelkes...<br> - I wonder if Mrs. Faulk is about?<br> - I would like to thank her.<br> - Yeah.<br> She's about.<br> And about to make an announcement.<br> Sit down, you two.<br> Sit down.<br> I got a proposition to make,<br> a business proposition.<br> You know, Miss Jelkes, honey,<br> you impress me.<br> Very favorably. The way<br> you dished up that fish and all.<br> So favorably, in fact, that I'm prepared<br> to make you the following proposition.<br> What proposition, Mrs. Faulk?<br> I want a Coke.<br> Beer. Beer!<br> My proposition is this:<br> that you take over here.<br> The place furnishes a living<br> plus a neat little profit.<br> I take in about 4000 a year,<br> after expenses.<br> Four thousand dollars.<br> It wouldn't surprise me<br> if you couldn't do even better...<br> ...provided Shannon there<br> didn't drink up your share of the profits.<br> Well, that's the deal.<br> We split the profits fifty-fifty.<br> Even-steven.<br> Share and share alike.<br> Does that make any sense to you?<br> Maxine. Are you all right?<br> Of course I'm all right.<br> What do you mean, am I all right?<br> My only reason for including you<br> on this deal is a man's presence is required.<br> There's gotta be a man. That's one of<br> the basic principles of hotel administration.<br> There's gotta be a man to make<br> the place attractive to the ladies.<br> Wives of the men that go fishing.<br> Matter of fact, my offer is contingent<br> on the presence of a man.<br> - There's no deal unless Shannon stays on.<br> - What about you, Mrs. Faulk?<br> Me? I'm fed up with this place.<br> Fed up to the teeth, into the gums<br> and the jawbone.<br> - Jungle rot's set in.<br> - Where are you going?<br> Well, I'm not going on any<br> of your Blake Tours, that's for sure!<br> I'm heading north.<br> El Paso, maybe. Yeah, I like El Paso.<br> Air-conditioned cocktail lounges.<br> Fifteen-to-one martinis and mirrors that<br> don't scare you when they look at you!<br> You know, I'm a young woman. Attractive,<br> too, if I can get to a decent beauty parlor.<br> Don't you worry about the widow Faulk.<br> She'll have a ball!<br> - Fantastic.<br> - Yes, Mr. Shannon.<br> Fantastic is what it is.<br> You were building your nest<br> and you didn't even know it.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - At least let me drive you into town.<br> - No, thank you, I prefer to walk.<br> What you could do for me, though,<br> is have my luggage sent in after me.<br> Oh, I almost forgot.<br> I found this in the pocket of my smock<br> when I was packing this morning.<br> Yes, I want you to have it.<br> I couldn't possibly accept,<br> Mr. Shannon.<br> No, take it, please. Hock it.<br> It'll pay your way back to the States.<br> That's a real amethyst...<br> ...so don't let the local loan shark<br> give you less than 1800 pesos for it.<br> Its value has been well-established<br> over the years.<br> Very well, Mr. Shannon.<br> I'll send the pawn ticket<br> back to you so that you can redeem it.<br> - What are you doing, Maxine?<br> - Packing.<br> Go on, fall apart.<br> Everything's falling apart,<br> including you and Shannon!<br> Complimentary rum-coco.<br> It's a speciality of the Costa Verde.<br> I don't want a rum-coco. If I wanted<br> a rum-coco, I'd make a rum-coco.<br> She's gone, Maxine.<br> The poem's finished.<br> You mean she's not gonna<br> take me up on my proposition?<br> Oh, she's not.<br> I am.<br> That is, if you...<br> If you really need a man around here.<br> It's not hot yet, Shannon.<br> Why don't we go down to the beach.<br> Well, I can...<br> I can get down the hill, Maxine,<br> but I'm not too sure about getting...<br> ...back up.<br> I'll get you back up, baby.<br> I'll always get you back up.<br>
