                        He was an old man who fished alone<br> in a skiff in the Gulf Stream...<br> ... and he had gone 84 days now<br> without taking a fish.<br> In the first 40 days,<br> a boy had been with him.<br> But after 40 days without a fish<br> the boy's parents told him...<br> ... that the old man was now definitely<br> and finally salao...<br> ... which is the worst form of unlucky...<br> ... and the boy had gone at their orders<br> in another boat...<br> ... which caught three good fish<br> the first week.<br> The old man had taught the boy to fish,<br> and the boy loved him.<br> The old man was gray and wrinkled,<br> with deep furrows in the back of his neck...<br> ... and his hands had the deep, creased scars<br> from handling heavy fish on the cords.<br> But none of these scars were fresh.<br> They were as old as erosions<br> in a fishless desert.<br> Everything about him was old,<br> except his eyes.<br> And they were the same color as the sea,<br> were cheerful and undefeated.<br> It made the boy sad to see the old man<br> come in each day with his skiff empty.<br> He always went down to help him carry<br> the lines, the gaff and harpoon...<br> ... and the sail that was furled<br> around the mast.<br> The sail was patched<br> with flour sacks, and furled.<br> It looked like the flag<br> of permanent defeat.<br> No one would steal<br> from the old man...<br> ... but it's better to take<br> the sail and lines home...<br> ... as the dew was bad for them.<br> Though he was sure no<br> local people would steal...<br> ... the old man thought<br> a gaff and a harpoon...<br> ... were needless temptations<br> to leave in a boat.<br> The successful fishermen were already in<br> and had butchered their marlin out...<br> ... carried them laid full-length<br> across two planks to the fish house...<br> ... where they waited for the ice truck<br> to carry them to the market in Havana.<br> "Can I offer you a beer on the terrace?"<br> The boy asked.<br> "Why not?" the old man said.<br> "Between fisherman."<br> Two beers, Martin. Please.<br> They sat on the terrace and many<br> fishermen made fun of the old man.<br> But he was not angry.<br> He did not remember<br> when he had attained humility...<br> ... but he knew he had attained it...<br> ... and he knew it was not disgraceful<br> and it carried no true loss of pride.<br> Some of the older fishermen<br> looked at him and were sad...<br> ... but they did not show it.<br> They spoke about the currents...<br> ... and the depths they'd<br> drifted their lines at...<br> ... and the steady, good weather<br> and of what they had seen.<br> - Santiago.<br> - Yes?<br> Can I go and get the sardines<br> for you tomorrow?<br> Oh, no. No.<br> You play ball. I can still row,<br> and I can still throw the net.<br> I know where I can get four fresh baits.<br> I still have mine from today.<br> Let me get four fresh ones.<br> - One.<br> - Two.<br> Two.<br> - You didn't steal them, did you?<br> - I would, but I bought these.<br> Thank you.<br> If I cannot fish with you,<br> I'd like to serve in some way.<br> You bought me a beer.<br> You are already a man.<br> They walked up the road together.<br> The old man stood the mast<br> outside his shack.<br> In the old man's shack,<br> there was a bed, a table, chairs...<br> ... and a place to cook with charcoal.<br> On the brown walls, there was a picture<br> in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus...<br> ... and another of the Virgin of Cobre.<br> These were relics of his wife.<br> Once there had been a tinted photograph<br> of his wife on the wall.<br> But he had taken it down because<br> it made him too lonely to see it.<br> It was on the shelf in the corner,<br> under his clean shirt.<br> Tomorrow is the 85th day.<br> Eighty-five is a lucky number.<br> How'd you like to see me bring one in<br> that dressed out over a thousand pounds?<br> Are you strong enough now<br> for a truly big fish?<br> I think so.<br> And there are many tricks.<br> Santiago, I could go with you again.<br> We've made enough money.<br> No, no. You are in a lucky boat.<br> You stay with them.<br> Remember how long we went<br> without fish before?<br> Then we caught big ones every day<br> for three weeks.<br> I remember.<br> I know you did not leave me<br> because you lost confidence.<br> It was my papa made me leave.<br> I am a boy and I must obey him.<br> Of course, of course.<br> It is quite normal.<br> He hasn't much faith.<br> - But we have, haven't we?<br> - Yes.<br> If you were my boy,<br> I would take you out again.<br> But you are your father's and your mother's,<br> and you are in a lucky boat.<br> What do you have to eat?<br> I have a pot of yellow rice and some fish.<br> Would you like some?<br> No. I'll eat at home.<br> - May I take the cast net?<br> - Of course.<br> I have yesterday's newspaper.<br> I will read the baseball.<br> There was no cast net. The boy remembered<br> when they had sold it.<br> But they went through<br> this fiction every day.<br> There was no pot of yellow rice and fish,<br> and the boy knew this.<br> He didn't know whether yesterday's paper<br> was a fiction too.<br> The old man brought it out<br> from under the bed.<br> Keep warm, old man.<br> Sit in the sun.<br> Remember, we're in September.<br> The month of the big fish.<br> Anybody can be a fisherman in May.<br> I'll be back when I get the sardines.<br> Then you can tell me about the baseball.<br> - Hey, Manolin, come on.<br> - Play first base.<br> Hey, yeah. Come on.<br> - Manolin.<br> - A dinner for two, please. To take out.<br> You don't eat at home anymore?<br> - How much do you have to spend?<br> - Sixty cents.<br> No luck yet, huh?<br> You know, maybe it's not luck at all.<br> Maybe he's too old.<br> He's not too old. You'll see.<br> - I said, maybe.<br> - Not even maybe.<br> All right.<br> I only hope when I'm an old man<br> I have a boy to fish for me.<br> When the boy came back,<br> the old man was asleep in a chair...<br> ... and the sun was going down.<br> His shoulders were still powerful,<br> although very old.<br> The neck was still strong too.<br> The creases did not show so much<br> when the old man was asleep.<br> His head was very old, though.<br> And with his eyes closed,<br> there was no life in his face.<br> Wake up, old man.<br> The old man opened his eyes,<br> and for a long moment...<br> ... he was coming back<br> from a long way away.<br> Then he smiled.<br> What have you got?<br> - We're gonna have supper.<br> - I'm not very hungry.<br> Come on and eat.<br> You can't fish and not eat.<br> I have.<br> You won't fish without eating<br> while I'm alive.<br> Well, then you live a long time<br> and take good care of yourself.<br> Who...? Who gave this to you?<br> Martin. At the terrace.<br> Well...<br> ...I must be sure and thank him.<br> I thanked him already.<br> You don't need to thank him.<br> They had eaten with no light on the table,<br> and it was dark now.<br> The old man had talked to the boy<br> about baseball as always.<br> About the great DiMaggio<br> and how he was himself again...<br> ... and about the other men on the team.<br> Tell me about the great John J. McGraw.<br> He used to come to the terrace sometimes...<br> ...in the olden days too.<br> His mind was on the horses, I think,<br> as much as it was on the baseball.<br> At least he used to carry lists<br> of horses in his pocket at all times.<br> And frequently, he would speak<br> the names of horses on the telephone.<br> He was a great manager.<br> My father thinks he was the greatest.<br> That's because he came here<br> the most times.<br> If Durocher had continued coming here...<br> ...your father would think<br> he was the greatest manager.<br> Who is the greatest manager, really?<br> I think they are all equal.<br> Sometime I would like to take<br> the great DiMaggio fishing.<br> They say his father was a fisherman.<br> Maybe he was poor like we are,<br> and he would understand.<br> You ought to go to bed so that<br> you'll be fresh in the morning.<br> I'll take these things back to the terrace.<br> - Good night. See you in the morning.<br> - You're my alarm clock.<br> Age is my alarm clock.<br> - Sleep well, old man.<br> - Thank you.<br> Good night.<br> The boy went out and the old man thought,<br> "Why do old men wake so early?<br> Is it to have one longer day?"<br> Then the old man rolled up his trousers<br> to make a pillow...<br> ... putting the newspaper inside them.<br> He rolled himself in the blanket<br> and slept on the papers...<br> ... that covered the springs of the bed.<br> He was asleep in a short time...<br> ... and he dreamed of Africa,<br> when he was a boy.<br> He dreamed of the golden beaches and the<br> white beaches so white they hurt your eyes.<br> And the high capes<br> and the great brown mountains.<br> He lived along that coast now every night,<br> and in his dreams...<br> ... he heard the surf roar, and saw<br> the native boats come riding through it.<br> He smelled the tar and oakum<br> of the deck as he slept...<br> ... and he smelled the smell of Africa that<br> the land breeze brought with the morning.<br> Usually when he smelled<br> the land breeze, he woke up...<br> ... and dressed to go to wake the boy.<br> But tonight the smell of the land breeze<br> came very early...<br> ... and he knew it was too early in his dream<br> and went on dreaming.<br> To see the white peaks of the island<br> rising to the sea...<br> ... and he dreamed of the different harbors<br> and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.<br> He no longer dreamed of storms<br> nor of women...<br> ... nor of great occurrences<br> nor of great fish...<br> ... nor fights nor contests of strength<br> nor of his wife.<br> He only dreamed of places now...<br> ... and of the lions on the beach.<br> They played like young cats,<br> and he loved them as he loved the boy.<br> He never dreamed about the boy.<br> In the dawn, the old man simply woke...<br> ... looked out the door at the dying moon,<br> unrolled his trousers and put them on.<br> Then went down to wake the boy.<br> He was shivering with cold...<br> ... but he knew that he would shiver himself<br> warm and that soon he would be rowing.<br> The door of the house<br> where the boy lived was unlocked...<br> ... and he opened it and walked in quietly<br> with his bare feet.<br> The boy was asleep on a cot in the room<br> and the old man could see him clearly.<br> He took hold of one foot gently<br> and held it until the boy woke...<br> ... and turned and looked at him.<br> The boy was sleepy,<br> and the old man said, "I'm sorry."<br> "It is what a man must do,"<br> the boy answered.<br> They walked down the road,<br> and all along the road in the dark...<br> ... barefoot men were moving,<br> carrying the masts of their boats.<br> How did you sleep?<br> Very well, Manolin. I feel confident today.<br> I do too.<br> I'll get the sardines. Be right back.<br> Have another cup. We have credit here.<br> The old man drank his coffee slowly.<br> It's all he'd have all day,<br> and he knew that he should take it.<br> For a long time now, eating had bored him,<br> and he never carried a lunch.<br> He had a bottle of water<br> in the bow of the skiff...<br> ... and that was all he needed for the day.<br> Good luck, old man.<br> Good luck.<br> There were other boats going out to sea...<br> ... and the old man heard<br> the dip and push of their oars.<br> In the dark, the old man could feel<br> the morning coming.<br> And as he rode, he heard the trembling<br> sound as flying fish left the water...<br> ... and the hissing their stiff, set wings<br> made as they soared away in the darkness.<br> He was very fond of flying fish, as they<br> were his principal friends in the ocean.<br> He was sorry for the birds,<br> especially the small, delicate, dark terns...<br> ... that were always flying and looking<br> and almost never finding.<br> He thought, "The birds have<br> a harder life than we do...<br> ... except for the robber birds<br> and the heavy, strong ones.<br> Why do they make birds so delicate and<br> fine when the ocean can be so cruel?<br> She is kind and very beautiful,<br> but she can be so cruel. "<br> The sun rose from the sea, and<br> the old man could see other boats...<br> ... low on the water and well in toward<br> the shore, spread out across the current.<br> He always thought of the sea as la mar...<br> ... which is what people call her<br> in Spanish when they love her.<br> Sometimes those who love her<br> say bad things of her...<br> ... but they are always said<br> as though she were a woman.<br> Some of the younger fishermen spoke of her<br> as a contestant or a place or an enemy...<br> ... but the old man had always<br> thought of her as feminine...<br> ... and as something that gave<br> or withheld great favors.<br> "The moon affects her as it does a woman,"<br> he thought.<br> Before it was light, he had his baits out<br> and was drifting with the current.<br> One bait was down 40 fathoms,<br> the second was at 75...<br> ... and the third and fourth were down<br> in the blue water at 100 and 125 fathoms.<br> Then the sun was brighter and the glare<br> came on the water, and as it rose clear...<br> ... the flat sea sent it back to his eyes<br> so it hurt sharply...<br> ... and he rode without looking into it.<br> He looked down and watched the lines<br> that went down into the dark of the water.<br> Each bait hung head-down<br> with the shank of the hook inside...<br> ... tight and sewed solid.<br> All of the projecting part of the hook...<br> ... the curve and the point,<br> was covered with sardines...<br> ... each sardine hooked through both eyes so<br> they made a garland of the projecting steel.<br> There was no part of the hook<br> that a fish could feel...<br> ... that was not sweet-smelling<br> and good-tasting.<br> "I keep them with precision," he thought.<br> "Only, I have no luck anymore.<br> But who knows? Maybe today.<br> Every day is a new day.<br> It is better to be lucky,<br> but I would rather be exact.<br> Then when luck comes, you are ready. "<br> The sun was two hours higher now...<br> ... and it did not hurt his eyes so much<br> to look into the east.<br> Just then he saw a man-o'-war bird.<br> He made a quick drop, slanting down on his<br> backswept wings, and then circled again.<br> He's not just looking.<br> He's found something.<br> You will make a beautiful bait.<br> He did not remember when he'd first started<br> to talk aloud when he was by himself.<br> In the old days, he had sung<br> at night when he was alone...<br> ... steering on his watch on the turtle boats.<br> He had probably started to talk aloud,<br> when alone, when the boy had left...<br> ... but he did not remember.<br> It was considered a virtue<br> not to talk unnecessarily at sea...<br> ... and the old man had always<br> considered it so and respected it.<br> But now he said his thoughts<br> aloud many times...<br> ... since there was no one they could annoy.<br> "If the others heard me," he thought,<br> "they would think I am crazy.<br> But since I am not crazy, I do not care.<br> And the rich have radios to talk to them<br> on their boats, to bring them the baseball. "<br> Yes. Yes.<br> Then he felt something hard<br> and unbelievably heavy.<br> It was the weight of the fish...<br> ... and he let the line slip<br> down, down, down...<br> ... unrolling off the first<br> of the two reserve coils.<br> This far out, he must be huge in this month.<br> Eat them, fish. Eat them.<br> Please eat them.<br> How fresh they are...<br> ...and you down deep<br> in that cold water in the dark.<br> Come on, now.<br> Make another turn.<br> Then eat them. Just smell the sardines.<br> Then there is the tuna...<br> ...cold and hard and lovely.<br> Come on, fish. Eat them.<br> Don't be shy.<br> He'll take it.<br> God help him to take it.<br> He can't have gone.<br> God knows he can't have gone.<br> He must be making another turn.<br> Perhaps he has been hooked before,<br> and he remembers part of it.<br> He was just turning. He's going to take it.<br> What a fish!<br> Now he has it sideways in his mouth...<br> ...and he's going away with it.<br> As it went down, slipping lightly through<br> the old man's fingers...<br> ... he could still feel the great weight...<br> ... though the pressure of his thumb<br> and finger were almost imperceptible.<br> He's taken it.<br> Now let him eat it.<br> Eat it good, now, fish.<br> Go on, eat it.<br> Eat it until the point of the hook<br> goes into your heart and kills you...<br> ...then come up nice and easy<br> and let me put the harpoon into you.<br> Now, are you ready?<br> Have you been long enough at table?<br> Now the fish was struck, and the old man<br> could feel that he was hooked.<br> Now he should run with the line or jump<br> or sound to the depths below...<br> ... but nothing happened.<br> The fish just moved away slowly...<br> ... and the old man could not<br> raise him an inch.<br> His line was strong<br> and made for heavy fish...<br> ... and he held it until it was so taut<br> that beads of water were jumping from it.<br> Then the boat began to move...<br> ... slowly off toward the northwest.<br> The old man leaned back against the pull.<br> The fish moved steadily, and they<br> traveled slowly on the calm water.<br> The other baits were still in the water,<br> but there was nothing to be done.<br> This will kill him.<br> He can't keep this up forever.<br> But four hours later, the fish was still<br> swimming steadily out to sea...<br> ... towing the skiff, and the old man<br> was still braced solidly.<br> "What a fish to pull like that!" he thought.<br> "He must have his mouth<br> shut tight on the wire.<br> I wish I could see him only once<br> to know what I have against me. "<br> There was no land in sight now.<br> "That makes no difference," he thought.<br> "I can always come in on the glare<br> off the lights from Havana. "<br> It was noon when I hooked him,<br> and I have not yet seen him.<br> I wish the boy was here.<br> I'm being towed by a fish,<br> and I am the towing bitt.<br> "What I will do if he decides to go down,<br> I don't know.<br> What I'll do if he sounds<br> and dives, I don't know.<br> I'll do something.<br> There are plenty of things I can do.<br> I could make the line fast, " he thought,<br> "but then he could break it.<br> I must hold him all I can and then<br> give him line when he must have it.<br> Thank God he is traveling<br> and not going down. "<br> It was cold after the sun went down...<br> ... and the old man's sweat dried cold<br> on his back and his arms and his old legs.<br> "He didn't come up when the sun set,"<br> he thought.<br> "Maybe he will come up with the moon.<br> If he does not do that, maybe he will<br> come up with the sunrise.<br> I wish I could see him.<br> I wish I could see him only once<br> to know what I have against me. "<br> Two porpoises came round the boat,<br> he could hear them rolling and blowing.<br> He could tell the difference between<br> the noise the male made...<br> ... and the sighing blow of the female.<br> "They're good," he thought.<br> "They play and make jokes<br> and love one another.<br> They are our brothers, like the flying fish. "<br> Then he began to pity the great fish<br> he had hooked.<br> "He is wonderful and strange," he thought.<br> "Who knows how old he is."<br> Never have I had such a strong fish...<br> ...or one that acted so strangely.<br> Maybe he's too wise to jump.<br> He could ruin me with a jump.<br> Or one quick rush.<br> Maybe he has been hooked<br> many times before...<br> ...and he knows this is how<br> he must make his fight.<br> He took the bait like a male.<br> He moves like a male.<br> There is no panic in his fight.<br> I wonder if he has a plan<br> or if he's just as desperate as I am.<br> I wish the boy was here.<br> The fish never changed his course<br> nor his direction all that night...<br> ... as far as the old man could tell<br> from watching the stars.<br> He felt the strength of the great fish moving<br> steadily toward what he had chosen...<br> ... and he thought,<br> "When once through my treachery...<br> ... it had been necessary for him<br> to make a choice...<br> ... his choice had been to stay<br> in the deep water...<br> ... far out beyond all snares and traps<br> and treacheries.<br> My choice was to go there and find him<br> beyond all people.<br> Beyond all people in the world.<br> Now we are joined together<br> and have been since noon.<br> And no one to help either one of us. "<br> "I have lost 200 fathoms of good line<br> and hooks and leaders, " he thought.<br> "That can be replaced.<br> But who replaces this fish<br> if I hook some fish and it cuts him off?<br> I don't know what the fish was<br> that took the bait just now.<br> Could have been a marlin or a broadbill<br> or a shark. I never felt him.<br> I had to get rid of him too fast. "<br> "I wonder what he made that lurch for,"<br> he thought.<br> "The wire must have slipped<br> on the great hill of his back.<br> Certainly his back cannot<br> feel as badly as mine does...<br> ... and he cannot pull this skiff forever...<br> ... no matter how strong he is. "<br> "Please, God, let him jump.<br> Maybe if I can increase the tension a little<br> more, it will hurt him, and he will jump.<br> Let him jump so that he will fill the sacs<br> along his backbone with air...<br> ... and then he cannot go deep to die. "<br> Fish, I love you<br> and I respect you very much...<br> ...but I will kill you<br> before this day ends.<br> A small bird came toward the skiff<br> from the north.<br> He was a warbler<br> and flying very low over the water.<br> And the old man could see<br> that he was very tired.<br> Hey...<br> ...how old are you?<br> Is this your first trip?<br> Why are you so tired?<br> What are birds coming to anyway?<br> "The hawks," he thought,<br> "that come out to sea to meet them."<br> But he said nothing of this to the bird,<br> who could not understand him anyway...<br> ... and who'd learn about the hawks<br> soon enough.<br> It is all right, small bird.<br> You rest for a minute.<br> But then you must go in, and you must<br> take your chances like every man...<br> ...and every fish and every bird must do.<br> I wish I could hoist my sail and take you in<br> with the small breeze that's rising...<br> ...but I'm with a friend.<br> Something hurt him.<br> You're feeling it now, fish.<br> And so, God knows, am I.<br> "How did I let the fish cut me with one pull<br> he made?" the old man thought.<br> "I must be getting very stupid.<br> I better pay attention to my work.<br> And then I must eat the bonito<br> so I will not have a failure of strength.<br> I wish the boy was here to cut up<br> the bonito, and I wish I had some salt.<br> I don't think I can eat an entire one. "<br> What kind of a hand is that?<br> Go on. Cramp if you want to.<br> Make yourself into a claw.<br> It will do you no good.<br> I must eat the bonito...<br> ...not to lose my strength.<br> Do not blame the hand.<br> It is not the hand's fault.<br> And you have been a long time<br> with fish.<br> How do you feel, hand?<br> Or is it too early to know?<br> Maybe it will open with the sun.<br> If I have to open it, I will open it.<br> Cost whatever it cost.<br> "God help me to have the cramp go,"<br> he thought.<br> "Because I don't know what the fish<br> is going to do.<br> But he seems calm and following his plan,<br> but what is his plan?<br> What is mine?<br> Mine I must improvise to his<br> because of his great size.<br> If he will jump, " he thought,<br> "I can kill him."<br> Hand. Come on, hand.<br> He's coming up. Hand.<br> He's longer than the skiff.<br> Oh, he's a great fish.<br> Thank God they are not as intelligent<br> as we who kill them.<br> Although they are more noble...<br> ...and more able.<br> I wonder why he jumped.<br> It's almost as though he jumped<br> just to show me how big he was.<br> Bad news for you, fish.<br> It was getting late in the day now, and<br> the skiff still moved slowly and steadily.<br> The old man was suffering...<br> ... although he did not admit<br> to suffering at all.<br> I am not religious...<br> ...but I will say 10 Our Fathers and<br> I will also make a pilgrimage<br> to the Virgin of Cobre.<br> That is a promise.<br> "Our Father, who art in heaven,<br> hallowed be thy name."<br> He commenced to say his prayers<br> mechanically.<br> Sometimes he would be so tired<br> that he could not remember the prayer.<br> Then he would say them so fast,<br> they would come automatically.<br> "Hail Marys are easier to say<br> than Our Fathers, " he thought.<br> The old man felt very tired, and he knew<br> that the night would come soon...<br> ... and he tried to think of other things.<br> He thought of the big leagues.<br> To him, they were the gran ligas.<br> And he knew that the Yankees of New York<br> were playing the Tigers of Detroit.<br> "This is the second day now that I do not<br> know the results of the games, " he thought.<br> Then, to give himself more confidence...<br> ... he remembered the time<br> in the tavern at Casablanca...<br> ... when he played the hand game<br> with a Negro from Cienfuegos...<br> ... who was the strongest man<br> on the docks.<br> He was not an old man then,<br> but he was in his prime.<br> He and the Negro had gone<br> one day and night...<br> ... with their elbows on a chalked line<br> on the table.<br> There was much betting, and the odds<br> changed back and forth all night...<br> ... and they changed the referees<br> every four hours...<br> ... so that the referee<br> could get some sleep.<br> They fed the Negro rum.<br> Once, after the rum,<br> the Negro made his all-out bid.<br> But the old man raised his hand<br> up to dead even again.<br> He was sure that he had the Negro,<br> who was a fine man and a great athlete...<br> ... beaten.<br> At daylight, when bettors were asking him<br> to call it a draw...<br> ... because they had to go to work<br> on the docks...<br> ... the old man unleashed<br> his greatest effort.<br> He knew that he had broken<br> the confidence of the Negro...<br> ... and now he finished the bout<br> before anyone had to go to work.<br> For a long time after that,<br> everyone had called him "the champion."<br> How do you feel, fish?<br> I feel fine.<br> My left hand is better.<br> Pull the boat, fish.<br> Just before it was dark, as they passed<br> the great island of sargasso weed...<br> ... that heaved and swung<br> as though the ocean were making love...<br> ... with something under<br> a yellow blanket...<br> ... his small line had been taken<br> by a dolphin...<br> ... and he had brought it into the skiff.<br> What an excellent fish dolphin is...<br> ...to eat cooked...<br> ...and what a miserable fish raw.<br> "I had better keep the fish quiet now<br> and not disturb him too much at sunset.<br> The setting of the sun<br> is a difficult time for all fish. "<br> It was darker now, as it becomes dark<br> quickly after the sun sets in September.<br> The first stars were out.<br> He did not know the name of Rigel,<br> but he saw it...<br> ... and knew soon they would be out,<br> and he would have all his distant friends.<br> "The fish is my friend too," he thought.<br> Never have I seen or heard<br> of such a fish.<br> But I must kill him.<br> I'm glad I do not have to kill the stars.<br> Imagine how it would be if, every day,<br> a man had to try to kill the moon.<br> The moon runs away.<br> But think what it would be if, every day,<br> he had to try to kill the sun.<br> We're born lucky.<br> "It was half a day and a night, and now<br> another day, and you have not slept.<br> If you do not sleep,<br> you might become unclear in the head.<br> Rest now, old man.<br> Let him do the work.<br> Until it is time...<br> ... for your next journey. "<br> He lay forward, cramping himself<br> against the line with his body...<br> ... putting all his weight on his left hand,<br> and he was asleep.<br> He did not dream of the lions,<br> but instead, of a vast school of porpoises...<br> ... that stretched for eight or 10 miles,<br> and it was in the time of their mating.<br> And they would leap high into the air...<br> ... and return in the same hole they<br> made in the water when they leaped.<br> Then he dreamed he was in the village,<br> on his bed.<br> And there was a norther,<br> and he was very cold.<br> And his arm was asleep because his head<br> had rested on it instead of a pillow.<br> After that, he began to dream of<br> the long yellow beach...<br> ... and he saw the first of the lions.<br> And he waited to see if there would be<br> more lions, and he was happy.<br> Then he dreamed of the whales<br> that passed along this coast in the fall.<br> And of their mating too, and of their<br> friendliness with each other, and their play.<br> The moon had been up for a long time,<br> but he slept on.<br> And the fish pulled on steadily,<br> and the boat moved into a tunnel of clouds.<br> He woke with a jerk of his fist coming up,<br> and the line burning out through his hand.<br> This is what we waited for.<br> Now let us take it.<br> Make him pay for the line.<br> Make him pay for it.<br> "I will show him what a man can do<br> and what a man endures, " he thought.<br> The thousand times he had proved it<br> meant nothing.<br> Now he was proving it again.<br> Each time was a new time...<br> ... and he never thought about the past<br> when he was doing it.<br> "If the boy were here, he could wet<br> the coils of the line, " he thought.<br> "Yes, if the boy were here,<br> if the boy were here. "<br> "Now he has jumped and filled<br> the sacs along his back with air.<br> Now he cannot go down deep to die.<br> He will start circling soon,<br> then I must start working on him. "<br> Well, you didn't do so badly...<br> ...for something that is worthless.<br> Now I have done my best.<br> He will begin to circle soon.<br> Let the fight come.<br> The sun was rising for the third time<br> since he had put out to sea.<br> The fish was circling slowly,<br> and the old man was wet with sweat...<br> ... and tired deep into his bones.<br> I could not fail myself now...<br> ...and die on a fish like this.<br> Now that I have him coming so beautifully,<br> God help me to endure.<br> I will say 100 Our Fathers<br> and 100 Hail Marys.<br> But I cannot say them now.<br> Please consider them said.<br> I will say them later.<br> For an hour, he had been seeing spots<br> before his eyes.<br> Twice he had felt faint and dizzy...<br> ... and that had worried him.<br> Then suddenly, he saw a dark shadow...<br> ... that took so long to pass the boat<br> that he couldn't believe its length.<br> He can't be that big.<br> But he was that big.<br> He felt faint again.<br> "I moved him," he thought.<br> "Maybe this time I can get him over."<br> Pull, hands.<br> Hold on, legs.<br> "I must get him alongside this time,"<br> the old man thought.<br> Next time I'll pull him over.<br> He tried it once more.<br> And he felt himself going<br> when he turned the fish.<br> "I will try it again," the old man promised,<br> and he could only see well in flashes.<br> Fish, you're going to die anyway.<br> Do you have to kill me too?<br> He took all his pain and what was left<br> of his strength and his long-gone pride...<br> ... and he put it against the fish's agony.<br> "I must get him close, close,"<br> he thought.<br> "I mustn't try for the head,<br> I must get the heart. "<br> Now I have killed this fish<br> who was my brother.<br> Now I must do the slave work.<br> Get to work, old man.<br> The old man did not need a compass<br> to tell him where southwest was.<br> He only needed the feel of the trade wind<br> and drawing of the sail.<br> He could see the fish.<br> And he had only to look at his hands<br> and feel his back against the stern...<br> ... to know this had truly happened<br> and was not a dream.<br> "The hands cure quickly," he thought.<br> "I've bled them clean.<br> The salt water will heal them.<br> The dark water of the gulf<br> is the greatest healer that there is. "<br> Then his head started to become unclear,<br> and he asked himself:<br> "Is he bringing me in,<br> or am I bringing him in?"<br> They were sailing together,<br> lashed side by side.<br> And the old man thought,<br> "Let me bring him in, if it pleases him.<br> I am only better than him through trickery,<br> and he meant me no harm. "<br> They sailed well.<br> The old man soaked his hands in the water<br> and tried to keep his head clear.<br> He looked at the fish constantly<br> to make sure it was true.<br> It was an hour<br> before the first shark hit him.<br> He was a very big mako shark...<br> ... built to swim as fast<br> as the fastest fish of the sea.<br> Now he speeded up<br> as he smelled the fresher scent...<br> ... and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.<br> When the old man saw him coming,<br> he knew this shark had no fear at all...<br> ... and would do exactly what he pleased.<br> It's too good to be true.<br> Might just as well have been a dream.<br> Mako.<br> Now my fish bleeds again,<br> and there will be others.<br> It was too good to be true.<br> The old man did not look<br> at the fish anymore...<br> ... since it had been mutilated.<br> When the fish had been hit,<br> it was as if he himself had been hit.<br> "But I killed the shark that hit my fish,"<br> he thought.<br> "He was the biggest dentuso<br> I have ever seen.<br> It was too good to last. "<br> He knew that each of the jerking bumps<br> of the shark...<br> ... had been meat torn away...<br> ... and that the fish now made<br> a trail of blood for all sharks...<br> ... as wide as a highway through the sea.<br> He knew quite well the pattern<br> of what could happen...<br> ... when he reached the inner part<br> of the current...<br> ... but there was nothing to be done now.<br> "Yes, there is," he thought.<br> "I can lash my knife<br> to the butt of one of the oars. "<br> "I should've brought a stone for the knife,"<br> he thought.<br> "You should've brought many things,<br> but did not. Now is no time to think...<br> ... of what you do not have. Think what<br> you can do with what you have. "<br> "You give me good counsel," he thought.<br> "I'm tired of it."<br> I am still an old man,<br> but I will not be unarmed.<br> Come on, galanos!<br> Come on. Come on, galanos!<br> Come on. Come on.<br> I went out too far, fish.<br> No good for you, nor for me.<br> I'm sorry, fish.<br> I still have almost half of him left.<br> Maybe I will have the luck to bring<br> that much of him in.<br> I should have some luck.<br> No.<br> No, you violated your luck<br> when you went too far out.<br> Don't be silly.<br> Stay awake and steer.<br> You still may have some luck.<br> I would like to buy some...<br> ...if there is a place where they sell it.<br> What would I buy it with?<br> A lost harpoon? A broken knife?<br> Two bad hands?<br> You might.<br> You tried to buy it with 84 days...<br> ...at sea.<br> They almost sold it to you too.<br> Must not think such nonsense.<br> Luck is a thing that comes in many forms.<br> Who can recognize her?<br> I wish I could see the lights of Havana.<br> I wish for too many things.<br> But that is what I wish now.<br> He saw the reflected glare of the light<br> of the city at around 10:00 at night.<br> He was stiff and sore now...<br> ... and his wounds and all of<br> the strained parts of his body hurt.<br> He could not talk to the fish anymore,<br> because the fish had been ruined too badly.<br> Then something came into his head.<br> Half fish.<br> Fish that you were.<br> I am sorry I went out too far.<br> Ruined us both.<br> But we have killed many sharks,<br> you and I...<br> ...and ruined many more.<br> How many have you ever killed, old fish?<br> You do not have that spear for nothing.<br> "What will you do now if they come<br> in the night?" he thought.<br> What will I do if they come in the night?<br> I'll fight them.<br> I'll fight them until I die.<br> "Oh, but I hope I do not<br> have to fight again, " he thought.<br> "I hope so much I do not<br> have to fight again. "<br> But he fought again, and this time<br> he knew the fight was useless.<br> Come on.<br> Come on!<br> Come on.<br> Come on, galanos!<br> Come on, galanos! Come on.<br> Come on, galanos! Come on!<br> He knew he was beaten now,<br> finally and without remedy.<br> I'm sorry, fish.<br> He could feel he was inside<br> the current now...<br> ... and he could see the lights<br> of the beach colonies along the shore.<br> He knew where he was now,<br> and it was nothing to get home.<br> "The wind is our friend anyway,"<br> he thought.<br> Then he added, "Sometimes."<br> "And the great sea with our friends<br> and our enemies and bed.<br> Bed is my friend, just bed.<br> Bed will be a great thing. "<br> It is easy when you are beaten.<br> What beat you?<br> Nothing. I just went out too far.<br> Man is not made for defeat.<br> Man can be destroyed,<br> but not defeated.<br> It was quiet in the harbor.<br> And he sailed up onto the little patch<br> of shingle below the rocks.<br> There was no one to help him.<br> He unstepped the mast,<br> furled the sail...<br> ... shouldered the mast,<br> and started to climb.<br> It was then he knew<br> the depth of his tiredness.<br> He had to sit down five times<br> before he reached the shack.<br> In the morning,<br> it was blowing so hard...<br> ... that the boats<br> would not be going out.<br> And the boy had slept late and then<br> had come to the old man's shack...<br> ... as he had come each morning<br> while the old man was gone.<br> The old man was asleep,<br> and the boy saw that he was breathing.<br> And then he saw the old man's hands,<br> and he started to cry.<br> He went out to bring some coffee, and<br> all the way down the road, he was crying.<br> Many fishermen were around the skiff,<br> looking at what was beside it.<br> And one was in the water, his trousers<br> rolled up, measuring the skeleton...<br> ... preparing to take off<br> the head and the bill.<br> The boy did not go down.<br> He had been there before.<br> Martin.<br> A can of coffee with plenty of milk<br> and sugar in it.<br> What a fish that was.<br> There has never been such a fish.<br> Those were two fine fish<br> you took yesterday.<br> Never mind about my fish.<br> Does he want a drink of any kind?<br> No. If he does, I'll be back.<br> You tell him how sorry I am.<br> Thanks.<br> I'll get the coffee.<br> They beat me, Manolin.<br> They truly beat me.<br> He didn't beat you, not the fish.<br> Did you suffer much?<br> Now we'll fish together again.<br> No, no.<br> I am not lucky anymore.<br> The hell with luck.<br> I'll bring the luck with me.<br> - What will your father say?<br> - I don't care what he says.<br> We'll...<br> We will have to get a killing lance<br> and keep it onboard at all times.<br> It must be very sharp...<br> ...and not tempered so it will break,<br> like my knife broke.<br> I'll get another knife.<br> How many days of heavy wind have we?<br> Oh, maybe three. Maybe more.<br> I'll have everything in order.<br> You get your hands well, old man.<br> They will be all right in a couple of days.<br> I know how to care for them.<br> During the night, I spat up<br> something strange.<br> I felt like something<br> in my chest was broken.<br> Get that well too.<br> Drink your coffee. I'll get you<br> something to eat.<br> And... And bring me the papers<br> from the time I was away.<br> I will.<br> That afternoon there was a party<br> of tourists from Havana at a caf.<br> One of them looked down,<br> and among the empty beer cans...<br> ... and dead barracuda, she saw the long<br> backbone of the great fish...<br> ... that was now just garbage<br> waiting to go out with the tide.<br> "What's that?" she asked the waiter.<br> "Tiburn," the waiter said. "A shark."<br> He was trying to explain<br> what had happened to the marlin.<br> "I didn't know sharks had such handsome,<br> beautifully formed tails, " the woman said.<br> "I didn't either,"<br> her male companion answered.<br> Up the road in his shack,<br> the old man was sleeping again.<br> He was still sleeping on his face, and<br> the boy was sitting by him, watching him.<br> The old man was dreaming about the lions.<br>
