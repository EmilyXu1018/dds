                        Deader than a Paiute's grave.<br> Well?<br> - That guy's awful slow getting there.<br> I feel sorry for him. Always in reach<br> and never able to do anything about it.<br> - I got a feeling she could do better.<br> - You're boasting.<br> - What'll you have? Whiskey?<br> - What you got?<br> Whiskey.<br> You ever see such a guy?<br> All winter I've been thinking....<br> And all he's got's whiskey.<br> - That's rotten, ain't it?<br> - Rotten.<br> Two glasses and a bottle.<br> - Well, what's on your mind?<br> - Does something have to be on my mind?<br> Well, here's mud in your eye.<br> Friendly cuss, ain't he?<br> He's getting around to asking<br> if his girl is in town.<br> His girl?<br> If you mean Rose Mapen, no.<br> She went to Frisco<br> the first stage out this spring.<br> That's a lie. She said she'd wait.<br> It's a fact.<br> What a town.<br> It's my guess the married women run<br> her out. No tar and feathers. No rails.<br> They just righteously<br> made her feel uncomfortable.<br> Not that she ever did anything.<br> They just couldn't get over<br> being afraid she might.<br> - What is there to do in this town?<br> - Unless you want to woo Drew's daughter-<br> We don't.<br> The only other unmarried woman<br> I know is 82, blind and a Paiute.<br> That leaves you five choices:<br> eat, sleep, drink, play poker or fight.<br> - Or you can shoot pool. I got a new table.<br> - That's just great.<br> - I see Risley's still around.<br> - The sheriff?<br> I thought he never got closer<br> than Reno except on special calls.<br> It wouldn't be that rustling folks<br> were talking about last fall?<br> Could be.<br> - Getting to be a touchy subject, huh?<br> - They don't like to talk about it.<br> - Afraid it's somebody they know?<br> - Maybe.<br> - They lose some more this spring?<br> - Some.<br> - How many?<br> - About 600 head.<br> They got any leads?<br> They picked up a trail and signs<br> of shod horses in the south draw.<br> Wouldn't everybody know if<br> there were strangers around?<br> There hasn't been any, except you two.<br> - That ain't funny.<br> - Now who's touchy?<br> You're talking about my business.<br> Stick to my pleasures.<br> No offense, Carter.<br> I want you to know where you stand.<br> - Listen-<br> - Take it easy, Gil.<br> He's sore about Rose Mapen.<br> - Keep your mouth shut about Rose, see?<br> - Okay, Gil. I was just joking.<br> - You can take a joke, can't you?<br> - Sure, I can take a joke. Some jokes.<br> Lost any over your way?<br> No more than the winter<br> and coyotes would account for.<br> - You haven't got any ideas, Farnley?<br> - Except not to have ideas.<br> Make that clear.<br> There are a lot of things<br> around here ain't clear.<br> You still talking about rustling?<br> And strangers.<br> - Looks happy, don't he?<br> - He just needed exercise.<br> Whenever he gets low in spirits<br> or confused in his mind...<br> ...he doesn't feel right<br> until he's had a fight.<br> It doesn't matter whether he wins<br> or not. He feels fine again afterwards.<br> Ain't that guy got there yet?<br> Holy cow, now I'm gonna<br> have to start all over again.<br> Somebody's sure in a hurry.<br> - Did Darby use his fist?<br> - No, a bottle.<br> - That's all right then.<br> - Lay off Farnley, will you?<br> - Why should I?<br> - You hit him pretty hard...<br> ...made him look foolish.<br> - Did I really get him?<br> - I thought you busted his neck.<br> No fooling.<br> Why, the no-good-<br> - Shot through the head, I tell you!<br> - Where did it happen?<br> - Southeast corner of the valley.<br> - Did you see it?<br> - No. Olsen found him laying in a dry wash.<br> Shot right through the head.<br> When?<br> About 2:00.<br> But he must've been shot earlier. They<br> picked his horse up near the ranch road.<br> - Any cattle missing?<br> - Well, they couldn't tell.<br> - Did Olsen send you for us?<br> - No, he yelled at me to go get the sheriff.<br> Hey, Jeff. Jeff!<br> - Rustlers?<br> - Looks that way.<br> - Who was it they got?<br> - Kinkaid.<br> Kinkaid? Farnley's buddy?<br> They've been working<br> together since they were kids...<br> ...from the Panhandle to Jackson's Hole.<br> I knew him. Short, dark Irishman.<br> Didn't say much. Liked to sing a lot.<br> These fellows will go a long way to get<br> that guy that killed Larry Kinkaid.<br> - Lynching?<br> - I judge.<br> He's crazy.<br> Wait, Jeff, there's no rush.<br> Even if they have a five-hour start.<br> It's 500 miles to the border.<br> Besides, there may be a bunch of them.<br> It won't help to get yourself killed.<br> That kid Greene ain't got<br> no idea which way they went.<br> We're all with you about Kinkaid.<br> Only we ought to form this posse right.<br> So if we go we're sure<br> to get what we go after.<br> Okay. Make your posse.<br> - Better get the sheriff and Judge Tyler.<br> - What do we want with old Tyler?<br> One good, fast job.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> - This ain't rustling. It's murder!<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Don't go and do something<br> we'll be sorry for.<br> We want to act in a reasoned manner,<br> not like a mob.<br> Davies, you've been storekeeping<br> too long. You don't see no profit in this.<br> If you fellas would offer<br> to buy the rope from him....<br> If we go, you're going<br> with us, fat-gut.<br> Brother, I wouldn't miss it.<br> The only thing that'd bring me out faster<br> would be your necktie party.<br> Who knows? Maybe this is yours.<br> I'll remember that and<br> see you handle the rope.<br> In Texas, we just go get a man<br> and string him up.<br> That's right. I say stretch him.<br> It ain't just a rustler,<br> it's a murderer.<br> Larry Kinkaid, one of the finest men<br> that ever lived...<br> ...is lying out there<br> with a bullet hole in his head.<br> If you let this go by,<br> there won't be nothing safe.<br> Our cattle, our homes, not even<br> our womenfolks. I'm with you, Farnley.<br> I'm going to get me a gun<br> and some rope.<br> If nobody else will do it,<br> me and you'll do it ourselves!<br> Count me in too.<br> Come on, boys, get your guns!<br> Listen to me, men.<br> Don't lose your heads like this!<br> You mustn't do this thing.<br> You must not!<br> Shut up, Grandma.<br> Nobody expects you to go.<br> Don't take it so hard, Mr. Davies.<br> You did all you could.<br> - Will you do me a favor?<br> - That depends.<br> I'm sending Joyce for the sheriff and<br> Judge Tyler. Go along and help explain.<br> You know how Art and I stand.<br> We came in at a bad time.<br> I've got to stop them,<br> till they realize what they're doing.<br> If I can make this thing regular,<br> that's all I ask.<br> Come on. Let's go.<br> - Wait. Do you know Mapes?<br> - The one they call Butch?<br> The sheriff's made him deputy for times<br> he's out of town. We don't want Mapes.<br> You said I was to be the executioner,<br> so I come all fixed.<br> Think I don't know<br> my business, huh?<br> You don't look very well, Mr. Davies.<br> Maybe you'd better stay home<br> and rest up for the funeral.<br> You could get the flowers.<br> Boys wouldn't begrudge flowers...<br> ...even for a rustler,<br> so long as he's a good, dead one.<br> Get your hat and gun.<br> I'm not going, Father.<br> I don't wish any argument.<br> Do as I say.<br> Perhaps this will do what I've obviously<br> failed to do: make a man of you.<br> Scrape your boots, put your hat<br> in your hand, and straighten your wig.<br> Well?<br> - Why, is the judge at home, ma'am?<br> - Yes.<br> - Could we see him?<br> - You got business?<br> No, we just dropped in for tea.<br> Very funny.<br> Mr. Davies sent us, ma'am.<br> It's awfully important.<br> It's not regular office hours.<br> - That the judge's better half?<br> - His housekeeper. His wife's dead.<br> You can see why the judge don't seem<br> to be able to make up his own mind.<br> Come in. Come in.<br> He says come in!<br> - Well, Carter. How're things?<br> - All right, I guess, judge.<br> You don't appear to have been<br> pining away exactly.<br> - What can I do for you gentlemen?<br> - We're here for Mr. Davies.<br> How is my friend Davies?<br> Well, I trust.<br> Yes, but could we see you alone<br> for a minute, judge?<br> - A matter of a private nature?<br> - Yes.<br> Davies said just you and Risley.<br> - Risley ain't here. He deputized me.<br> - Where did the sheriff go?<br> - Down to Kinkaid's ranch.<br> - When will he be back?<br> - A couple of days maybe.<br> - Anything you can tell him, you can tell me.<br> - We know. But we're here for Mr. Davies.<br> - If he thinks it's your job, he'll tell you.<br> - Certainly, Mapes.<br> All right, but if it's a sheriff's job,<br> call me, see?<br> Naturally.<br> Well, what can I do for you gentlemen?<br> It ain't that Mr. Davies<br> don't want them to go.<br> He wants to make sure a posse's<br> sworn in, to bring them in for a fair trial.<br> - That's why I wanted you to hurry.<br> - Confound it. The sheriff's not here.<br> - Today of all days.<br> - They'll listen to you.<br> No, no. That's not my job.<br> I haven't any police authority.<br> Where are you going?<br> There's a posse forming.<br> That's sheriff's work, ain't it?<br> That's no posse.<br> That's a lawless, lynching mob!<br> It'll be a posse when I get there.<br> I'm gonna deputize them all proper.<br> But you can't do that. Risley's<br> the only one empowered to deputize.<br> Shall we tell Davies you're coming?<br> Yes, yes, of course.<br> I suppose I'll have to.<br> But, doggone it,<br> this is the sheriff's job, not mine.<br> If he don't come around,<br> we'll go get him ourselves.<br> Coming along, Sparks?<br> No, I don't guess so.<br> Better come along, Sparks.<br> Ain't every day we have a hanging<br> in a town as dead as this one.<br> You won't have to do nothing.<br> All the real work is signed up.<br> We ought to have a reverend along,<br> because there gonna be some praying.<br> Maybe you're right, Mr. Smith.<br> Maybe somebody ought to go along<br> that feels the way I do.<br> Davies'll loan you his Bible, all<br> the reading will be done at the burial.<br> Thank you, sir, but I knows my text<br> without the Book.<br> - They're kidding you, Sparks.<br> - I know, sir...<br> ...but maybe Mr. Smith is accidentally<br> right. Maybe I ought to go along.<br> There's an old horse in my shed<br> you can use.<br> Thank you, sir. I'll go and fetch him.<br> Here comes Ma!<br> Come on, we're ready to go!<br> Hi, boys!<br> Come on, Jenny!<br> These boys are getting tired of waiting!<br> - Well, boys, what are we waiting for?<br> - Judge Tyler. Davies asked him to come.<br> I understand how it is, men.<br> My old friend Larry Kinkaid,<br> one of the finest and noblest-<br> Cut the stumping, Tyler.<br> All we want is your blessing.<br> Of course, you can't flinch<br> from what you believe to be your duty...<br> ...but certainly you don't want<br> to act hastily...<br> ...in the same spirit of lawlessness<br> that begot this foul crime.<br> Before you get ready to act,<br> them rustlers will be clear over the Rio.<br> One more word and I'll have you up<br> for impeding the course of justice.<br> Judge, you can't impede<br> what don't move anyway.<br> And you, Jenny Grier, a woman.<br> To lend yourself to this....<br> - Ha!<br> Now, now, listen. Listen, men.<br> I've just found out that<br> Sheriff Risley's already at Kinkaid's.<br> - That right?<br> Yes, he's been there all morning.<br> So, you see, probably everything's<br> being attended to right now. Legally.<br> All you'll get out of it<br> is a long, hard ride.<br> It'll be dark before long,<br> and mighty cold.<br> My advice is to come in, have a drink.<br> Let's wait till we hear from the sheriff.<br> Drinks on the house. But only one round.<br> I'm not filling any bucket bellies.<br> I'll make it two.<br> If you want to stay in town,<br> I can take six, if you sleep double.<br> It's not as if you were<br> giving up, boys. It's just good sense.<br> Farnley, come back!<br> I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!<br> You don't have to worry, Jeff. This<br> business is going to be taken care of.<br> Yeah, and I know who's gonna<br> take care of it. Me.<br> I tell you now, whoever shot Larry Kinkaid<br> ain't coming back here for you...<br> ...to fuddle with your lawyer's tricks<br> for six months and then be let off...<br> ...because Davies or some other whiny<br> old woman claim he ain't bad at heart.<br> Kinkaid didn't have six months<br> to decide if he wanted to die.<br> Disbanding, men?<br> Davies has convinced us, major.<br> - Of what, Mr. Davies?<br> - Why, of....<br> I take it you're assuming<br> the raiders left by the south draw?<br> - Why, yes, of course.<br> - They went east, by Bridger's Pass.<br> - Through the mountains?<br> The old stage road. Pike's Hole.<br> That's 8000 feet up.<br> Approximately.<br> They'd be crazy to go that way.<br> Not so crazy, perhaps, knowing how<br> crazy it would look to us.<br> - How come you're so sure, Tetley?<br> - Pancho saw them.<br> He was coming back from Pike's<br> and had trouble getting by them.<br> Si. He not see me, I think.<br> It was down the hollow, and I drive<br> my horse out of the way.<br> First, I say hello, and then I think<br> it's funny to drive cattle there.<br> - Cattle?<br> - Why you think I get out of his road?<br> Well, go on.<br> When I see what mark<br> those cattle have, I be quiet.<br> What kind of marks were they?<br> - Three little whatchamacallum.<br> - That's Kinkaid's mark.<br> Dirty rat!<br> There's no telling<br> what they'll try next!<br> How many?<br> Forty head.<br> I mean rustlers.<br> Three.<br> Why were you so long<br> in bringing us this word?<br> I knew my son would want to go along.<br> He was out on the range.<br> - You mustn't let this be a lynching.<br> - It's scarcely what I choose.<br> Promise me you'll bring them in<br> for a fair trial.<br> I'll abide by the majority will.<br> Tetley, you know what's legal<br> as well as I do.<br> All we ask is a posse to act<br> under a proper officer of the law.<br> That's where I come in.<br> Risley made me a deputy.<br> In that case, suppose you<br> deputize the rest of us.<br> That's not legal. No deputy<br> has the right to deputize.<br> - How about it, boys?<br> Suits me. Go ahead and pray.<br> Mapes, you're violating the law.<br> Raise your right hands.<br> I hereby solemnly swear that<br> I am duly sworn in as a deputy...<br> ...in the case of Kinkaid and am willing<br> to abide by decisions of the majority.<br> - Say I do.<br> I do!<br> You bring those men in alive, or as<br> I'm justice of this county, you'll pay for it.<br> And every jack-man of your gang!<br> Tetley!<br> Ain't you coming?<br> Get my horse. I'm going with them.<br> Then get to Kinkaid's. Get the sheriff.<br> We'll stop here and breathe our horses.<br> Take one man, go up to the top<br> of that ridge and see what you can see.<br> Doing this in the middle<br> of the night's crazy.<br> I thought you liked excitement.<br> I got nothing particular against<br> hanging a murdering rustler...<br> ...it's just I don't like<br> doing it in the dark.<br> There's always some fool who'll lose his<br> head and start hanging everybody in sight.<br> - Us?<br> - Funnier things have happened.<br> - We didn't have to come.<br> - Look kind of funny if we hadn't.<br> - I like to pick my own bosses.<br> - Whether we picked or not, we got them.<br> That's what I don't like. That Smith<br> and Bartlett shooting off their mouths.<br> Farnley and that renegade Tetley.<br> Strutting around in his uniform,<br> pretending he's so much.<br> He never even saw the South<br> till after the war.<br> Then only long enough to marry that<br> kid's mother and get run out by her folks.<br> Figured there was something<br> fishy about him, dressed like that.<br> Why would he be<br> living in this neck of the woods...<br> ...if he didn't have something to hide?<br> Let's get out of here before we all<br> freeze to death, or else give it up.<br> You'd be the laughingstock of the country<br> if you went home on account of the cold.<br> I'm telling you, this rope'll have to be<br> thawed out before it's fit to use.<br> Mind my coming in closer, Mr. Carter?<br> No, come on. I'm finding it<br> kind of lonesome myself.<br> - Powerful cold.<br> - I got a blanket if you want it.<br> Thank you just the same, but it takes<br> all my hands to stay on this old horse.<br> - You better have a couple of shots.<br> - I never use it.<br> I sure wish we was well out<br> of this here business.<br> It's a way of spending time.<br> It's man taking on himself<br> the vengeance of the Lord.<br> Think the Lord cares about<br> what's happening here?<br> He marks the sparrow's fall.<br> I seen my own brother<br> lynched, Mr. Carter.<br> I wasn't nothing but a little fella...<br> ...but sometimes now<br> wakes up dreaming about it.<br> Had he done<br> what they picked him up for?<br> I don't know.<br> Nobody never did know for sure.<br> Well, a couple shots more whiskey<br> can't do my soul any harm.<br> Darby sure sells rotten liquor.<br> Warms you up, though.<br> Feels like fire creeping<br> in the short grass.<br> I guess I'll just let her<br> spread a little while.<br> Put out that light, you fool.<br> You want to give us away?<br> - Who to?<br> - Chuck that butt, or I'll plug you.<br> Start something, for every hole<br> you make, I'll make two.<br> Looks like you're gonna have<br> a lot of shooting to do, Mr. Farnley.<br> Listen! Something's coming.<br> Fool, stop! Stop him!<br> - What's the matter, Art?<br> I'm shot.<br> - Where?<br> - Left shoulder.<br> You fool. Nobody but a drunken idiot<br> would drive down a grade in the dark.<br> I thought it was a stickup.<br> That coach ought to be<br> in the bottom of the canyon right now.<br> Rose Mapen!<br> Hello, everybody.<br> This is my husband,<br> Mr. Swanson of San Francisco...<br> ...and my sister-in-law,<br> Miss Swanson.<br> - Did you just get married, Rose?<br> - Just today.<br> No wonder you were in such a hurry.<br> My name's Tetley. I can<br> understand why Rose was in a hurry...<br> ...to show the other ladies what<br> could be done in the way of matrimony.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - What's everybody doing up here?<br> Why, uh....<br> Art's shot.<br> What? Bring him over here.<br> Give him a hand there.<br> You hadn't ought to come<br> barging out like that in the dark!<br> - I couldn't tell who it was, all the yelling....<br> - Aw, shut up.<br> Here, I'm good at this sort of thing.<br> Look, do women have to watch this?<br> There's room in the stagecoach<br> for you, Art.<br> - Yeah, I better get you back, get you food.<br> I'm all right.<br> Be a good boy. Don't be stubborn.<br> - Yeah, don't be a fool.<br> - Mind your own business!<br> - She's his wife now. And kind of new.<br> - Yeah, looks that way, don't it?<br> I take it you had the privilege of knowing<br> Miss Mapen before she married me?<br> That's right.<br> Possibly you imagined at the time there<br> was some understanding between you?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> - My wife is a very impulsive woman.<br> - That's what I'm saying.<br> I'm pleased to regard any friend<br> of my wife's as a friend of my own.<br> However, I don't need to remind you<br> the pleasure of such an acquaintance...<br> ...depends upon the recognition by all<br> parties that Miss Mapen is now my wife.<br> She must be given time to become<br> accustomed to her new responsibilities.<br> As yet, I must confess that<br> I'm jealous of her least attention.<br> You'll forgive me, I know.<br> A bridegroom is prone to be<br> overly susceptible for a time.<br> Later, when we've had time to get<br> accustomed to our new relations...<br> ...I shall be delighted to welcome you...<br> ...and others of my wife's friends<br> to our home in San Francisco.<br> If it is still her desire.<br> Until then.<br> Why, that superior little....<br> Looks like Rose has took<br> unto herself a lot of trouble.<br> - Where are we?<br> - The Ox-Bow.<br> There they are, gentlemen.<br> I suggest we avoid any shooting or<br> rough work until they tell it their way.<br> Mr. Mapes and I will do the talking.<br> - The one that got Kinkaid is mine.<br> - He's yours when we're sure.<br> Ten men will go with Mrs. Grier<br> from behind.<br> Bartlett, take six men<br> and work through those woods.<br> Gerald, you and Farnley<br> and the rest will go with me.<br> - Would you like a gun, Mr. Davies?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Sparks?<br> - Thank you, no, sir, Major Tetley.<br> As you choose.<br> Get up!<br> Drop it!<br> Now put up your hands.<br> That's all right, brother. You will.<br> Take it easy. Stay where you are<br> and put your hands up.<br> Gerald, collect their guns.<br> What do you want?<br> Shut up.<br> This ain't no stickup. This is a posse,<br> if that means anything to you.<br> But we haven't done anything.<br> Gerald!<br> Get 'em up!<br> Tie them up.<br> All right, get in there.<br> - Tell us what we're being held for.<br> - I'd rather you told us.<br> We must be pretty important,<br> or else awfully dangerous.<br> It ain't that you're so dangerous.<br> It's just that most of them<br> ain't never seen a triple hanging.<br> A hanging? What have we done?<br> Aren't you even going to tell us?<br> - Rustling. Ever hear of it?<br> - Rustling?<br> And murder.<br> Murder?<br> Mr. Martin, what did we do?<br> It's all right, Dad.<br> There's some mistake.<br> Remember me?<br> He's talking to you, mister.<br> - He don't speak English.<br> - I got a different notion.<br> I'll make him talk.<br> That'll do, Farnley.<br> I've had enough of your<br> playing God almighty!<br> Who picked you for this job<br> anyhow?<br> We got them.<br> Let's swing them before we all freeze.<br> If you're cold, here's the fire.<br> Warm yourself.<br> I advise you to control your tongue too.<br> We'll get along better.<br> - Who's boss of this outfit?<br> - I am.<br> - And your name?<br> - Donald Martin.<br> Where you from?<br> - Pike's Hole.<br> That's a lie.<br> He's from Pike's Hole.<br> Want to change your story?<br> I just moved in. I'm on<br> Dave Baker's place, up in the north end.<br> Dave moved out four years ago.<br> The place is a wreck.<br> The barns are all down, and the<br> sagebrush is up through the porch.<br> Well, I bought the place from him<br> for $4000 in Los Angeles last month.<br> - Then, mister, you was robbed.<br> - That may be.<br> Surely it's not so far to Pike's Hole<br> that you can't go find out.<br> My wife's there right now,<br> and my two kids.<br> That's really too bad.<br> Just too bad.<br> Even in this godforsaken country<br> I've got a right to a trial.<br> You're getting a trial with the only kind<br> of judges murderers and rustlers get...<br> ...in what you call<br> this "godforsaken country. "<br> So far,<br> the jury don't like your story.<br> I won't say another word<br> without a hearing.<br> This is all the hearing you'll get,<br> short of the Last Judgment.<br> Have you any cattle up here with you?<br> Hey, Mr. Martin.<br> I'm not gonna ask you again.<br> Yes, I have.<br> - How many?<br> - Fifty head.<br> - Where'd you get them?<br> - From Mr. Kinkaid.<br> That's just what we figured.<br> I'm no rustler. I didn't steal them.<br> I paid hard cash for them.<br> Mine were so bad, I didn't bring them.<br> I sold them off.<br> I had to stock up again.<br> Can't you wait till you see Kinkaid<br> or ask about me in Pike's Hole?<br> That's a good one.<br> He wants us to ask Kinkaid.<br> Gotta hand it to you,<br> you're a cool one.<br> You know as well as we do<br> Kinkaid can't tell us anything.<br> - He's dead.<br> - Dead?<br> What do you think we're here for?<br> How should I know?<br> He was all right yesterday.<br> Why don't you just<br> stop this farce and take us in?<br> Because the law's slow<br> and careless around here.<br> We're here to see it's speeded up.<br> - Who sent you up here?<br> - The sheriff.<br> That ain't true.<br> Let's don't get started again.<br> - The sheriff didn't know we were coming.<br> - I should have said deputy sheriff.<br> I'm not trying to obstruct justice, but just<br> as this young man says, this is a farce...<br> ...and it'll be murder<br> if you carry it through.<br> All he's asking is what<br> every man's entitled to: a fair trial.<br> You say you're innocent,<br> and I believe you.<br> Then you're the only one.<br> If there's any justice here...<br> ...it would only be after a confession.<br> They say they're innocent,<br> and you haven't proved they're not!<br> Shut up!<br> - Have you a bill of sale for those cattle?<br> - No, but Kinkaid said it'd be all right.<br> He was on the range and didn't<br> have one with him. He said he'd mail it.<br> - Moore.<br> - Yep?<br> - How long you been riding for Kinkaid?<br> - Six years.<br> Ever know him to sell any cattle<br> without a bill of sale?<br> No, can't say that I ever did.<br> Of course, I can't remember<br> every head he sold.<br> - But it's customary for him to give one?<br> - Yep.<br> Ever know him to sell cattle<br> after spring roundup?<br> - This year or any other year?<br> I can answer that.<br> I heard him say a couple days ago he<br> wouldn't sell a head to nobody this spring.<br> Well?<br> I know it looks bad, a dead man<br> as a witness, but it's the truth.<br> - You don't believe me?<br> - Would you, in my place?<br> I'd find out before hanging<br> three men who might be innocent.<br> If it were only rustling, maybe.<br> But with murder, no.<br> What are you trying to do?<br> Play cat and mouse?<br> I would prefer a confession, Martin.<br> If you've got doubts, let's call off<br> this party, take them to the judge.<br> This is only slightly any of your business.<br> Hanging's any man's business<br> that's around.<br> If your stomach for justice is cooling,<br> I advise you leave before we proceed.<br> Your interruptions will become tiresome.<br> I don't like it!<br> Hanging murderers is one thing...<br> ...but to keep possibly innocent men<br> sweating while you mouth off is another.<br> Take it easy.<br> This ain't our picnic.<br> If you keep on butting in, it might be.<br> You called this old man "Dad. "<br> - Is he your father?<br> - No.<br> Speak up,<br> you're taking it like a woman.<br> Keep your chin up.<br> You can only die once.<br> No, he works for me.<br> I didn't do it.<br> I ain't even got a gun.<br> Then who did?<br> The Mexican did it. He told me so.<br> No.... I saw him do it.<br> Juan couldn't have done it.<br> I was with him.<br> Yes, he did, Mr. Martin.<br> He was asleep...<br> ...and he didn't mean to tell me...<br> ...but I was awake, and<br> I heard him talking about it.<br> He doesn't know<br> what he's talking about.<br> He invents things.<br> If you've got to go through with<br> this comedy, let him alone.<br> - Shut up!<br> Lay off, Mapes!<br> First he won't talk.<br> Now he talks too much.<br> What's his name?<br> Alva Hardwick.<br> - And the other?<br> - Juan Martinez.<br> No, it ain't.<br> Still don't remember me, eh?<br> I'm talking to you, mister.<br> The devil you don't.<br> Your name's Francisco Morez.<br> The vigilantes would<br> like to get hold of you.<br> They want him for murder.<br> How about that?<br> - I don't know.<br> Stick together nice, don't they?<br> Why question me when you<br> don't believe anything I say?<br> There's truth in lies too,<br> if you can get enough of them.<br> What do you know about the old man?<br> - He was in the Army.<br> - Confederate or Union?<br> He's not clear about it himself.<br> Maybe both, at different times.<br> A half-wit in the Army?<br> Attention!<br> He's forgotten.<br> Not that.<br> I'll make a deal with you, Martin.<br> Tell us which of you shot Kinkaid<br> and the other two can wait.<br> None of us killed anybody.<br> Then that's all, I guess.<br> - Bring them along.<br> You're not going to do it really!<br> You've got to wait, I tell you!<br> You've gotta give us some time!<br> You've got to give us some time!<br> - We haven't done anything.<br> Throw the other rope up there.<br> Remember, the Mexican's mine.<br> My kids! One of them is a baby!<br> They haven't got a thing to go on!<br> I've got to write a letter.<br> If you're human, you'll give me time.<br> - That ain't asking much.<br> - They're trying to put it off.<br> - Want Tyler and the sheriff to get here?<br> - They won't come in time.<br> I believe you're right, Mr. Davies,<br> though I doubt if you want to be.<br> What time is it?<br> Five minutes after 3.<br> All right.<br> We don't want to give anyone<br> cause for complaint.<br> With your permission,<br> we'll wait till daylight.<br> Bring them back.<br> That'll give you time, Reverend,<br> to finish your business at leisure.<br> Sure. And them time to think it over.<br> - I can't write like this.<br> - Very well, untie them.<br> He says he wants to eat.<br> He's much hungry from so much talk.<br> Thank you.<br> Why, look! Fresh beef!<br> Oh, Ma, fix up a spread for everybody.<br> Can't call it stealing. By the time<br> it's ate, there won't be any owners.<br> What are you thinking about?<br> Sheriff. He's an awful long time<br> getting anywhere.<br> Suppose he don't get here at all?<br> That's what I'm thinking.<br> I'm not disputing that fact.<br> It may be a fine letter.<br> But if it's an honest letter,<br> it's none of my business to read it.<br> If it isn't, I don't want to.<br> - Is that my letter you're showing?<br> - Yes.<br> - What right have you to show it?<br> Don't raise your voice!<br> I told him I'd keep it for him.<br> - All I asked was to make sure it's delivered.<br> - I'm sorry. I was trying-<br> It's enough to be hanged without having<br> your private thoughts handed around.<br> - I said I'm sorry. I was merely-<br> - I don't care what you were doing!<br> I didn't write that letter to be passed<br> around. It's not their business!<br> I made no promise, son.<br> I thought there was one white man here.<br> I was wrong. Give me my letter.<br> I'll see that she gets it.<br> - I wouldn't have her touch it now.<br> In that case, give him back the letter.<br> Your wife ought to hear from you, son.<br> None of us could be as kind<br> and understanding as this letter.<br> She'll want to keep it<br> for your children.<br> I'm sorry.<br> The Mex!<br> Spread out!<br> He may have a gun!<br> Keep an eye on these two!<br> Where's he hit?<br> In the leg.<br> Here's his gun.<br> Well, I guess we know now, don't we?<br> Look!<br> - Say, that's Larry Kinkaid's gun.<br> Where'd you get this?<br> - Take this bullet out, I'll tell you.<br> - So he speaks American.<br> And 10 other languages, my dear.<br> But I don't tell anything I don't want to.<br> My leg, please. I wish to stand upright<br> when you come to your pleasure.<br> - Lend me a knife.<br> - Don't give him no knife.<br> He can throw a knife better<br> than most men shoot.<br> Better than any of you, no doubt.<br> But if you're afraid, I promise<br> to give the knife back, handle first.<br> I'll do it.<br> He is very polite, but has<br> no stomach for blood, eh?<br> That was very fine shooting, my friend.<br> You should try again with that one.<br> - Where'd you get that gun?<br> - Found it.<br> - Where?<br> - Lying in the road.<br> - You're a liar.<br> - Thought we'd find somebody...<br> - ...to send it back by.<br> - You're a liar.<br> - And you're a blind fool.<br> - I asked you where you got it.<br> - But that's the truth. He did find it.<br> - Undoubtedly.<br> Won't you even read it?<br> Because you've made up your minds,<br> or because everybody else has...<br> ...and you're afraid to stand up<br> for what is right?<br> You heard what Martin said.<br> What does it matter who sees<br> this letter if it saves him from hanging?<br> It's a beautiful letter.<br> Read it, and you'll know he's not<br> the kind of man who could steal or kill.<br> Maybe...<br> ...but that can't stand up against cattle,<br> no bill of sale, and a dead man's gun.<br> I suggest we act as a unit so there<br> can be question of mistaken reprisals.<br> Mr. Davies, are you willing to abide<br> by a majority decision?<br> - How about the rest of you?<br> Sure. Majority rules.<br> Everybody who's with Mr. Davies in turning<br> it over to the courts, step over there.<br> Excuse me.<br> Seven.<br> Not a majority, I believe, Mr. Davies.<br> Any other message<br> you'd like to leave, Martin?<br> - I don't wanna die.<br> - I'd like to make a confession.<br> And about time.<br> - To a priest.<br> There's no priest here.<br> This man can hear me<br> and take it to a priest.<br> All right. Get along with it.<br> Bring them along.<br> That must have been<br> an awfully busy life.<br> Farnley, you, Gabe Hart and Gerald<br> will whip the horses out.<br> No, not me.<br> Any volunteers?<br> I'll do it if no one else will.<br> - I won't do it.<br> - You'll do it.<br> - I can't.<br> - We'll see to it that you can.<br> The kid's seen enough already.<br> Let him alone.<br> This is not your affair, Carter.<br> Thank you just the same.<br> I'll have no female boys<br> bearing my name.<br> You'll do your part<br> and say nothing more.<br> What did he say?<br> - I ain't no priest.<br> For God's sake, at least<br> say whether we'd better wait.<br> I ain't no priest. I don't know.<br> No, thanks.<br> I'll give you two minutes to pray.<br> Time's up.<br> Will you find someone to look out for<br> my family? Better take some older woman.<br> - Don't worry.<br> - Miriam's parents live in Ohio.<br> Maybe Kinkaid's wife'll buy the cattle<br> back for enough to cover their travel.<br> Tie them up.<br> It's no good telling you<br> again that we're innocent?<br> - No good.<br> It's not for myself I'm asking.<br> Other men with families have<br> had to die. It's justice.<br> What do you care about justice?<br> You don't even care whether<br> you've got the right men.<br> All you know is<br> somebody's got to be punished.<br> There's nobody to look out for them.<br> Can't you understand that?<br> This is a fine company<br> for a man to die with.<br> - Shut up, you! Shut up!<br> - You shut up!<br> Careful! Careful!<br> Tear him loose, don't let him do that.<br> - Stop it, you fools!<br> - No, you stop it!<br> Keep him there!<br> All right. Put them up.<br> Miriam....<br> I don't want to die.<br> I don't want to die.<br> Anytime you're ready, Mr. Mapes.<br> Finish him.<br> Hey, there!<br> What's all that shooting about?<br> We got them, sheriff!<br> - Everything's been attended to.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Kinkaid's murderers. We got all of them.<br> - Hung them too, sheriff.<br> Larry Kinkaid's not dead.<br> Not dead?<br> But we just-<br> I just left Kinkaid with a doctor.<br> Caught the fellows who shot him too.<br> But, sheriff, they had Larry's cattle.<br> They even had his gun.<br> Give me that badge.<br> I know you well enough to know<br> you didn't have anything to do with this.<br> I'm depending on you<br> to tell me who did.<br> All but seven.<br> God better have mercy on you.<br> You won't get any from me.<br> All right, let's go.<br> If you've got no objections,<br> I'd like to read Martin's letter.<br> It'd be a good idea<br> if a lot of people read it.<br> If you ask me, that Tetley's<br> the one we ought to lynch.<br> You're a great one for hanging,<br> ain't you, Smith?<br> You loved it,<br> that's why you kept them waiting.<br> I saw your face. It was the face<br> of a depraved, murderous beast.<br> Only two things ever meant<br> anything to you: power and cruelty.<br> You can't feel pity.<br> You can't even feel guilt.<br> You knew they were innocent, but<br> you were crazy to see them hanged...<br> ...and to make me watch it.<br> I could've stopped you with a gun, just<br> as any other animal can be stopped...<br> ...but I couldn't do it<br> because I'm a coward.<br> Aren't you glad you made me go?<br> Weren't you proud of me?<br> How does it feel to have<br> begot a weakling, major?<br> Does it make you afraid there may<br> be some weakness in you too...<br> ...that other men might discover<br> and whisper about?<br> Open the door! I want to see your face.<br> I want to know how you feel now!<br> They're getting up a pot<br> for Martin's wife.<br> Even Mapes chipped in.<br> - I didn't know he was showing his face.<br> - He ain't. He sent it by Sparks.<br> That reminds me,<br> I put in 25 bucks apiece for us.<br> - How much they got?<br> - About 500.<br> Not bad for a husband who bought<br> cattle in the spring without a bill of sale.<br> Maybe you ought to read<br> this letter too.<br> You know I can't read.<br> I'll read it to you.<br> "My dear wife:<br> Mr. Davies will tell you<br> what's happening here.<br> He's a good man and<br> has done everything he can for me.<br> There are some other good men too,<br> only they don't realize what they're doing.<br> They're the ones I feel sorry for,<br> because it'll be over for me...<br> ...but they'll have to go on remembering<br> for the rest of their lives.<br> A man just can't take the law into his<br> own hands and hang people...<br> ...without hurting<br> everybody in the world...<br> ...because then he's not just<br> breaking one law, but all laws.<br> Law is a lot more than words<br> you put in a book...<br> ...or judges or lawyers or sheriffs<br> you hire to carry it out.<br> It's everything people ever have<br> found out about justice...<br> ...and what's right and wrong.<br> It's the very conscience of humanity.<br> There can't be any<br> such thing as civilization...<br> ...unless people have a conscience...<br> ...because if people<br> touch God anywhere...<br> ...where is it except<br> through their conscience?<br> And what is anybody's conscience...<br> ...except a little piece of the conscience<br> of all men that ever lived?<br> I guess that's all<br> I've got to say, except...<br> ...kiss the babies for me,<br> and God bless you.<br> Your husband, Donald. "<br> Where are we going?<br> He said he wanted his wife<br> to get this letter, didn't he?<br> Said there was nobody<br> to look after the kids, didn't he?<br>
