No kidding.<br> Nobody jokes<br> about grades.<br> Try getting a job<br> without them.<br> It's stacked against you if<br> you don't have the grades.<br> Don't think you're made<br> 'cause you go to Harvard.<br> Maybe I better<br> start studying then.<br> That's it. Study.<br> If there's any law around<br> the dorm, that's it.<br> That's the main rule.<br> Remember, I'm here to answer<br> your questions, so just ask.<br> And I'm the only third-year<br> student you can trust...<br> so talk to me.<br> Okay. Thanks a lot.<br> Right. So long.<br> My name's Ford.<br> I'm across the hall.<br> I knocked, but<br> you didn't hear me.<br> Hi. My name's Hart.<br> I came to ask you<br> to join my study group.<br> What's a study group?<br> It's a device. A tool.<br> Groups of<br> first-year students...<br> get together<br> a couple times a week.<br> Review the class work,<br> the casebooks.<br> They make outlines<br> and then share them.<br> It helps at exam time.<br> You interested?<br> Yeah. I'm interested.<br> You plan<br> to study all night?<br> No, I'm finished.<br> Five hours is plenty.<br> You want to get drunk?<br> Of course you have<br> to have the grades.<br> I mean, hell,<br> you can't wear "Harvard"<br> on a sign around your neck.<br> You gotta have the grades<br> and you have to look good.<br> Where you from, Hart?<br> Minnesota.<br> You went to<br> the university there?<br> Yeah. Where'd<br> you go to school?<br> Harvard.<br> In the grand tradition<br> of the Fords.<br> I'm something like fifth<br> generation Harvard.<br> Harvard Law School.<br> And depending on<br> if I get the grades...<br> and then make<br> the Law Review...<br> I'm on my way<br> to Wall Street.<br> You'll make<br> the Law Review.<br> Well, why not?<br> After all, I am a genius.<br> I've got an IQ of 190.<br> When I was a freshman<br> at college, I had 3 roommates.<br> One was a genius,<br> and one was crazy...<br> and one was inconsequential.<br> Kept to himself.<br> It was the genius who<br> told me about Kingsfield.<br> First guy to tell me<br> all about Kingsfield.<br> He read an article about him<br> in Life or Time.<br> Something about<br> a book he wrote.<br> It was called<br> Contracts in Our Daily Lives.<br> Yeah.<br> To make a long story short...<br> genius took the law school<br> admission's test...<br> but didn't score high enough<br> to get into Harvard.<br> Genius.<br> The study of law...<br> is something new and unfamiliar<br> to most of you.<br> Unlike any schooling<br> you've ever been through before.<br> We use<br> the Socratic Method here.<br> I call on you,<br> ask you a question...<br> and you answer it.<br> Why don't I just<br> give you a lecture?<br> Because through my questions,<br> you learn to teach yourselves.<br> Through this method of<br> questioning, answering...<br> questioning, answering...<br> we seek to develop in you<br> the ability to analyze...<br> that vast complex of facts<br> that constitute...<br> the relationships of members<br> within a given society.<br> Questioning and answering.<br> At times you may feel that you<br> have found the correct answer.<br> I assure you that this is<br> a total delusion on your part.<br> You will never find the correct,<br> absolute, and final answer.<br> In my classroom, there is<br> always another question...<br> another question<br> to follow your answer.<br> Yes, you're on a treadmill.<br> My little questions<br> spin the tumblers of your mind.<br> You're on an operating table.<br> My little questions are<br> the fingers probing your brain.<br> We do brain surgery here.<br> You teach yourselves<br> the law...<br> but I train your mind.<br> You come in here<br> with a skull full of mush...<br> and you leave<br> thinking like a lawyer.<br> Ford's study group?<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> James Hart.<br> Hi. Kevin Brooks.<br> This is Hart,<br> Kevin, and O'Connor.<br> This is<br> Anderson and Bell.<br> We were just talking about<br> the most sensible thing...<br> to do at the beginning<br> is divide up the courses.<br> Each person be responsible<br> for his particular course.<br> Each person do an outline.<br> Then at the end<br> of the year...<br> we have them<br> Xeroxed and exchange them.<br> Now, I propose that<br> nobody buys any outlines...<br> because they won't reflect<br> the work we've done together.<br> I'm gonna take property.<br> There's no guarantee<br> we'll all be here in the spring.<br> Some of us might have<br> nervous breakdowns.<br> I think we should do research<br> on nervous breakdowns.<br> I want property.<br> I've already<br> started property.<br> Hart, don't you think this<br> is the most logical thing...<br> to divide up the courses?<br> Yeah.<br> Let's divide<br> the courses up.<br> We've divided them.<br> I'm taking property.<br> I think we should talk about<br> who gets which course.<br> Maybe we should draw lots.<br> Like I said, I've already<br> started property.<br> Forget it, shorty.<br> Listen...<br> Bell, try to think of this<br> in terms of maximum utility.<br> Try to attain the highest<br> average possible.<br> Treat all your courses<br> as of equal importance.<br> They're not equal.<br> My father is in property.<br> I know that stuff.<br> That's different.<br> Go ahead and take property.<br> If you like and you know it,<br> you'll do a better job.<br> I can outline<br> something else.<br> Anderson, which course<br> would you like?<br> Doesn't matter to me.<br> I've made my study schedule<br> out to the end of the year...<br> dividing my time equally<br> among all the courses.<br> I'll outline anything.<br> Kevin?<br> I don't know which<br> course I'll be best at.<br> I don't think you should<br> outline your best course.<br> Perhaps your overall average<br> would improve with your worst.<br> I don't know which course<br> will be my worst.<br> I don't care as long<br> as it's not contracts.<br> I hate that son of a bitch<br> Kingsfield.<br> Hart, which one<br> do you want?<br> Contracts.<br> You sure?<br> Yeah.<br> Okay, I'll take criminal law.<br> You guys who haven't decided...<br> can divide up the other<br> courses any way you like.<br> Civil procedure.<br> I'm going up to Mass Avenue<br> to get something to eat.<br> You want to go?<br> No, thanks.<br> What is this, some sort<br> of endurance contest?<br> No. This is a really<br> fascinating case...<br> about this guy who went<br> around killing everybody...<br> walking in his sleep.<br> Well, you want me<br> to bring you back a pizza?<br> Oh, no. No, thanks.<br> Yeah. All right.<br> Yeah. Good-bye. Yeah.<br> Hello. Do you mind?<br> There's someone following me.<br> Just to the corner's<br> all right.<br> I'll walk you home.<br> All right.<br> I knew law school was hard...<br> but I didn't think it was going<br> to be as hard as it really is.<br> You're up against<br> some incredible minds here.<br> I think this guy's gonna<br> be a supreme court justice...<br> this guy's gonna run<br> Wall Street...<br> this guy might be<br> president of the United States.<br> What it is, though,<br> is this incredible sense of power.<br> This is where I live.<br> - Know what I mean?<br> - Yes.<br> Have you ever walked through<br> the law school campus?<br> - Yes.<br> - Then you know what I mean.<br> When I walk down<br> those streets...<br> I get the feeling<br> that behind those doors...<br> minds are being formed<br> to run the world.<br> Good night.<br> Thank you.<br> Pleasure's been mine.<br> Good night.<br> Ford?<br> Ford?<br> Hey, Ford, wake up.<br> What the hell<br> are you doing?<br> Where the hell are we?<br> Langdell.<br> I know that, but where?<br> In the heart of the beast.<br> Ah, this goddamn<br> building gets to me.<br> Comforts me...<br> restores my soul.<br> Yea, though I walk<br> through the valley...<br> of the shadow of ignorance...<br> I shall fear no evil...<br> for the law is with me.<br> Okay, get the book you want<br> and let's get out of here.<br> Wait a minute.<br> There's somebody else<br> in here.<br> Hey...<br> that's Kingsfield.<br> Come on.<br> We're gonna have to get up<br> so early to keep up with him.<br> What are the elements<br> that can lead to a party...<br> being excused from performing<br> his part of a contract...<br> and yet not paying damages?<br> Mr. O'Connor?<br> Both parties<br> predicate their contract...<br> on an assumption<br> about a state of facts...<br> and the assumption<br> is untrue.<br> Elaborate?<br> Mr. Anderson?<br> Both parties must share<br> the assumption.<br> The assumption must be material,<br> i.e., that the true state of<br> facts is that it is impossible...<br> to complete the contract<br> in any reasonable manner.<br> Both parties must be dealing<br> with each other in a fair manner...<br> and neither party may obtain<br> an unfair advantage...<br> because the contract<br> is dissolved.<br> Example?<br> Well,<br> suppose I were to agree...<br> to rent an apartment<br> from you...<br> an old apartment which you<br> hadn't visited in a while...<br> and the time came<br> for me to move in...<br> and we discovered the apartment<br> house had burned down.<br> That actually happened to me.<br> Personal comment<br> is not necessary.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> I was walking by<br> and I saw your light.<br> How nice. Come in.<br> It's very interesting<br> to me how quickly...<br> the classes have divided up<br> into three factions.<br> One faction being the students<br> who sit in the back.<br> Given up sitting<br> in their assigned seats...<br> preparing the cases.<br> What is it, only October?<br> They've already<br> given up trying.<br> Cowards.<br> The second group are the ones<br> who won't raise their hands...<br> or volunteer an answer,<br> but will try when called upon.<br> That's where I am,<br> right now...<br> living in a state<br> of constant fear.<br> And then there's<br> the third echelon.<br> The upper echelon.<br> The volunteers.<br> They raise<br> their hands in class.<br> They thrust themselves<br> into the fray.<br> I don't think they're smarter<br> than anyone else...<br> but they have courage.<br> And they'll achieve<br> the final recognition.<br> The teachers will get<br> to know their names...<br> and they'll get better...<br> better grades.<br> Past couple weeks, I've been<br> preparing for the upper echelon...<br> and this weekend if<br> I get all my work done...<br> I'm going to enter it<br> Monday morning.<br> In Kingsfield's<br> contract law class.<br> The facts of<br> Carbolic Smoke Ball.<br> Miss Farranti?<br> This is a case<br> where the defendants...<br> entered an advertisement<br> in the Pall Mall Gazette...<br> November 1891...<br> stating that a 100 reward<br> would be paid...<br> by The Carbolic<br> Smoke Ball Company...<br> to any person who contracted<br> influenza or a cold...<br> or any disease<br> caused by taking cold...<br> after using the ball<br> according to the directions.<br> Now, on the strength<br> of this advertisement...<br> a Mrs. Carlill<br> bought a smoke ball...<br> used it according<br> to the directions...<br> until she developed<br> influenza.<br> What were the reasons<br> for the court's finding...<br> in favor of Mrs. Carlill?<br> She had fulfilled<br> the conditions of the offer.<br> The bargain was complete.<br> Was there a bargain?<br> Was there communication<br> between the parties?<br> Was she not obligated<br> to notify the company...<br> that she had accepted<br> their offer?<br> Mr. Hart.<br> It's obvious that notice<br> is not important here.<br> The offer requires no notice<br> or personal communication.<br> What is important<br> is consideration.<br> Question... Did Mrs. Carlill<br> give anything to the company?<br> The company argues that<br> Mrs. Carlill, in using the ball...<br> did absolutely nothing<br> for them.<br> All they were interested in<br> was the sale itself.<br> The answer to that<br> is obvious.<br> Of course, they benefit<br> from the sale itself...<br> but beyond this...<br> consideration does not<br> necessarily in all cases...<br> have to pass<br> to the other party.<br> Mrs. Carlill suffered<br> the inconvenience...<br> of having to use the ball.<br> She gave something up...<br> even if it didn't<br> pass to the other party.<br> So, you can only have<br> a binding contract...<br> when each party gives<br> something to the other...<br> or suffers an inconvenience<br> by or from the other party.<br> - Damn good.<br> - A good answer.<br> Not a complete analysis,<br> not a hard question...<br> but the point is<br> I did it.<br> I did it<br> in Kingsfield's class.<br> This is a goddamn dance!<br> I'm telling you, the worst<br> thing a law student can do...<br> is get involved with a girl.<br> Affairs by their very nature<br> are time-consuming.<br> On the contrary, it's<br> the best thing you can do.<br> Nothing makes you<br> hornier than studying.<br> My father warned<br> me about that.<br> Your father's<br> full of shit.<br> He said the celibate mind<br> is sharper...<br> retains more<br> information.<br> The third year you can<br> get laid all you want to.<br> The only sensible thing<br> to do in a mess like this...<br> is find a woman that doesn't<br> make demands and hang on.<br> Hang on like hell.<br> Grab onto her boobs<br> and don't let go.<br> Oh, no.<br> What?<br> I thought you set<br> the alarm at 12:00.<br> I gotta study.<br> Oh, crap, I got<br> Kingsfield at 9:00.<br> The auctioneer<br> is the agent of the vendor...<br> and the assent of<br> both parties is necessary...<br> to make<br> the contract binding.<br> An auction,<br> is not unaptly called then...<br> Iocus poenitentiae,<br> which means?<br> Mr. Hart?<br> Mr. Hart?<br> Mr. Bell?<br> Locus poenitentiae<br> means place of repentance...<br> or for changing one's mind.<br> You asleep?<br> No.<br> Where you been?<br> Walking on the point.<br> I was watching<br> the rowers.<br> I've been thinking.<br> About what?<br> The trouble with<br> entering the upper echelon...<br> is you have to work harder<br> to stay in it.<br> And you haven't been<br> working hard enough?<br> I haven't been<br> working hard enough...<br> since I've been<br> seeing so much of you.<br> I'm not getting<br> enough sleep.<br> I shouldn't have drunk<br> so much wine.<br> Seems so much energy<br> gets wasted.<br> Kingsfield caught me<br> Friday unprepared.<br> Not following<br> the discussion.<br> I swore he'd never catch me<br> unprepared again.<br> And it's all my fault?<br> Is that what you're saying?<br> Well... you don't give me<br> very much sustenance, Susan.<br> Much what?<br> Sustenance.<br> Alimentum victus.<br> Way of life. Livelihood.<br> Nourishment. Support.<br> Susan?<br> Susan?<br> Susan?<br> Susan!<br> You bitch!<br> Susan!<br> Susan!<br> Hi.<br> I'll meet you out front.<br> Where have you been?<br> I've been sleeping<br> in the park.<br> You ought to try it sometime.<br> It's wildly therapeutic.<br> Hey! You missed the meeting<br> of the study group.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It won't happen again.<br> Anderson's right.<br> You cannot balance...<br> girls and law school<br> at the same time.<br> Kingsfield's having<br> a party in 2 weeks.<br> Day after Thanksgiving.<br> - What?<br> - He gives one every year<br> according to Toombs.<br> - We all got invitations.<br> I put yours on the typewriter.<br> - Fantastic.<br> I get enough of<br> the old bastard in class.<br> I don't have<br> a decent tie to wear.<br> Good night, Hart.<br> Yeah. Good night.<br> "Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr.<br> "Pleasure... cocktails...<br> "Friday, November 24.<br> R.S.V.P."<br> Greetings.<br> - How are you?<br> - Good.<br> Hi.<br> How are you?<br> Asheley, sweetheart...<br> I want you<br> to meet my friend.<br> Hart, I want you to meet<br> my wife Asheley.<br> This is Hart. We're in<br> the same study group.<br> Oh, hi.<br> How do you do?<br> Hello.<br> Jesus. If this is<br> supposed to give us...<br> closer contact<br> with the faculty...<br> someone made<br> a terrible mistake.<br> This place is fantastic.<br> It's just like<br> I thought it would be.<br> - It gives me the creeps.<br> - Don't be nervous.<br> Everyone's running around<br> getting bombed...<br> or trying to kiss<br> Kingsfield's ass.<br> Excuse me, Asheley.<br> Just make like you can<br> vanish or materialize...<br> anytime you like.<br> Anytime you like.<br> Have you said hello<br> to Kingsfield yet?<br> It's too crowded.<br> I thought I'd wait.<br> Oh, no, that's<br> his daughter.<br> Can you believe<br> Kingsfield has a daughter?<br> She just got back in town.<br> She's been in Europe.<br> He's in the study,<br> running this party...<br> just like he runs<br> his class... fear.<br> He's in with his pictures<br> of the Law Review of 1929...<br> a big leather chair,<br> and all his casebooks.<br> He needs a setting.<br> Wouldn't dream of it.<br> Besides, I don't think<br> you'll earn a goddamn penny.<br> Oh, let's not argue.<br> Hello, how are you?<br> Hart, have you gotten into<br> Warner vs. Davis yet?<br> Excuse me, Ed.<br> You going home? You haven't<br> paid homage to my father.<br> Why don't I take you<br> to meet him?<br> Why didn't you tell me you<br> were Kingsfield's daughter?<br> I'm not his daughter very much.<br> Why didn't you call me?<br> Wait a minute.<br> You left me in the park.<br> Why didn't you call me?<br> I knew I'd see<br> you here today.<br> You lied to me, Susan.<br> You told me your<br> last name was Fields.<br> My last name is Fields.<br> I'm married.<br> Oh, man.<br> We are...<br> We're separated.<br> He's still in Europe,<br> and we're getting a divorce.<br> So why come back?<br> Because my mother is in<br> a mental institution.<br> That's why I came back.<br> Sorry.<br> She's crazy as hell,<br> but I'm not.<br> Couldn't prove it by me.<br> I have spent<br> my required hour.<br> Would you like<br> to take a walk?<br> No. You look too different<br> dressed like that.<br> I've got to think.<br> Please, excuse me.<br> I'll be home at 9:00.<br> Did you have a nice walk?<br> What?<br> I can see<br> the resemblance.<br> I was just looking at some<br> photographs of my father...<br> and I don't see<br> the resemblance at all.<br> I look much more<br> like my mother.<br> It all makes<br> so much sense.<br> The way you looked at me<br> when I talked about him...<br> telling you things<br> that happened in class.<br> Didn't you ever want<br> to burst out laughing?<br> No. It's very serious.<br> I've been here before.<br> What do you mean?<br> My husband Philip<br> was a law student too.<br> It's some curse of my father's<br> that follows me around.<br> And that's why I didn't<br> invite you in the first night.<br> But when you came back,<br> there wasn't much I could do.<br> Where is Philip?<br> Is that his name?<br> Yes.<br> Where is he now?<br> We were married for 2 years...<br> and I saw where<br> my life was going...<br> and I didn't and I don't<br> want that kind of life.<br> You haven't answered<br> my question.<br> Where is Philip now?<br> Wandering around Europe<br> with a knapsack.<br> He dropped out of law school.<br> Why?<br> I refuse to answer<br> on the grounds...<br> that it may incriminate me.<br> I don't like the way<br> you're looking at me.<br> It was much nicer before<br> not having any background.<br> I wouldn't say that.<br> Our relationship<br> has changed.<br> It certainly has.<br> I'm going to ask you<br> a question.<br> You came back here because<br> I'm Kingsfield's daughter.<br> That's not a question.<br> That's an answer.<br> Now...<br> suppose I write you<br> a contract.<br> It says...<br> "I agree for $100<br> to paint your apartment<br> with white paint."<br> Is there any difference<br> between this...<br> and a contract which says...<br> "You agree to paint<br> my apartment with white paint...<br> provided I pay you $100."<br> Mr. Brooks.<br> You won't find it in<br> the casebook, Mr. Brooks.<br> It's just a hypothetical.<br> I am waiting, Mr. Brooks.<br> I'm not sure I understood it all.<br> Could you tell me it again?<br> In one case,<br> there are two mutual promises.<br> In the other, there is<br> a condition on a promise.<br> Mr. Brooks, do you know<br> the difference between...<br> a condition on a promise<br> and a promise?<br> Mr. Brooks, did you<br> read this material?<br> Yes, I did read the material.<br> I memorized the facts.<br> - I have a photographic memory.<br> - A what?<br> A photographic memory.<br> Would you repeat that?<br> A photographic memory.<br> A photographic memory...<br> is of absolutely no use<br> to you, Mr. Brooks...<br> without the ability<br> to analyze...<br> that vast mass of facts<br> between your ears.<br> Did you hear me, Brooks?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Could you give me<br> the hypothetical again?<br> I didn't understand it.<br> Mr. Ford...<br> do you know<br> the difference between...<br> a condition on a promise<br> and a promise?<br> It's a very<br> difficult concept.<br> A very difficult point<br> in the law.<br> You just shouldn't have<br> raised your hand in class.<br> I thought he was going<br> to ask me the facts.<br> I couldn't hold the<br> hypothetical in my mind.<br> It's like my mind<br> was outside his...<br> watching myself unable<br> to bring it together.<br> People laughed,<br> didn't they?<br> I didn't hear anybody<br> laughing at you.<br> I heard people laughing.<br> Hey, relax.<br> We'll have a swim.<br> Feel better.<br> Justice Douglas...<br> Franklin Roosevelt...<br> Ernest Hemingway...<br> Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<br> Adlai Stevenson.<br> Helen Keller.<br> Interested in his study?<br> I played in this study<br> when I was a little girl.<br> I used to run<br> the dictaphone.<br> Adequacy.

He's back.<br> Listen, get out<br> through the kitchen.<br> Just go out<br> the kitchen.<br> My clothes are upstairs.<br> I'll get 'em.<br> You just go.<br> I'll take care of this.<br> Just go on.<br> - So what did he say?<br> - Well, he just said he hoped<br> it wasn't a law student.<br> Now, will you state<br> the facts...<br> of the case of<br> Vigers vs. Cook?<br> Mr. Pruit.<br> Cook's son died.<br> Vigers was the undertaker...<br> Or was Cook<br> the undertaker?<br> Mr. Sanders.<br> You just want the facts?<br> Mr. Fisher.<br> This undertaker agreed...<br> to provide the usual<br> funeral services.<br> Mr. Knight.<br> Vigers gave Cook<br> an estimate...<br> that the whole thing<br> would cost about 49.<br> Thank you,<br> thank you.<br> Now, the rest<br> of the facts, Mr...<br> The body was placed<br> in a coffin...<br> Ford.<br> The body was placed<br> in a lead coffin.<br> The coffin was soldered<br> without a vent hole.<br> The coffin then burst...<br> owing to decomposition<br> of the body...<br> and it was impossible<br> to hold the services...<br> in the church.<br> I never said anything.<br> I just went upstairs,<br> I got your things...<br> I put on my coat,<br> and I came right down.<br> Then why did he look at me<br> that way in class?<br> He questioned<br> the student on my left...<br> on my right,<br> in front of me...<br> behind me, and then,<br> glaring at me...<br> asked somebody else<br> the question.<br> I don't know,<br> but believe me...<br> you're just a name<br> on a piece of paper...<br> a picture on a seating chart,<br> and that's all.<br> You're only one<br> out of thousands...<br> over the past 40 years.<br> I don't<br> believe that.<br> He knows<br> who I am.<br> Susan!<br> What?<br> We can't<br> go on like this.<br> Like what?<br> Look, I've gotta<br> get organized.<br> What is it?<br> The middle of February...<br> and I've got 4 months<br> till exams.<br> I never know when or if<br> I'm gonna see you.<br> What kind of organization<br> did you have in mind?<br> When's your divorce final?<br> When's your divorce final?<br> Oh, no more contracts,<br> Mr. Hart.<br> Thank you, no.<br> Are you really serious?<br> Well, if not<br> the honorable thing...<br> why not the dishonorable?<br> I'd prefer to live alone.<br> I don't know<br> what you want.<br> I don't know<br> what to do with you.<br> Well, I don't want to live<br> in the married students' dorm...<br> and have neat friends down the hall<br> and walk babies with them.<br> I've been organized<br> like that before.<br> You law students,<br> you're all the same.<br> You can't let things alone.<br> You have to organize.<br> The endless defining<br> of irrational human behavior...<br> into tight<br> little patterns.<br> People are not rational.<br> People are irrational.<br> What do you want?<br> Do you want me<br> to be irrational?<br> All right.<br> I shall be irrational.<br> I'm gonna walk<br> on the water!<br> Is that irrational enough<br> for you?<br> No? Okay.<br> I shall walk on my hands<br> on the water.<br> Now that's<br> more like it.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Give me the coat.<br> The coat.<br> Keep off the ice!<br> Here.<br> Oh, God!<br> Oh, crap.<br> It's only 3 feet deep.<br> God.<br> Get out, Hart.<br> I gotta go back<br> and get warm.<br> I know there's a lot<br> of things to say...<br> but it really isn't<br> worth saying...<br> so please just get out.<br> Think about me...<br> and think about yourself.<br> Don't call me.<br> I know you're gonna want to...<br> but just don't, okay?<br> I Xeroxed an article<br> I found in the library...<br> called<br> Blessings of Consideration.<br> Kingsfield wrote it<br> Well worth the time.<br> What are we<br> gonna do...<br> about practice<br> exams?<br> Nothing.<br> Practice exams don't count.<br> They don't mean a thing.<br> Look, Kevin, just keep aiming<br> towards the end of the year.<br> You'll just have to relearn<br> it all then anyway.<br> I thought it would<br> give us a chance...<br> to see how we stand.<br> Whether one of us<br> needs special help.<br> You need<br> special help...<br> and you, too,<br> O'Connor.<br> You both need<br> a shrink.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean<br> to touch your outline.<br> I agree with Ford. I've given<br> this problem considerable thought...<br> and in terms of maximum<br> grade point...<br> the most sensible thing<br> is not to study.<br> See how much you retain...<br> as a result of normal<br> study procedure.<br> And then you'll be able<br> to measure accurately...<br> how much extra work<br> you'll need...<br> when it comes to take<br> the real test in the spring.<br> I thought we might all study together<br> for the practice exam.<br> It would give us<br> a chance to see how well...<br> we'll work together<br> at the end of the year.<br> But we don't have time<br> to get up for this test.<br> We just take it.<br> It doesn't count.<br> But what I really<br> would like to do...<br> is just talk about how<br> to take the exam.<br> That's not so bad an idea.<br> I'd like a session<br> on examsmanship.<br> Maybe you need somebody<br> to hold your hand.<br> Okay, this article has a very<br> interesting relationship...<br> to the statute of frauds...<br> which I thought we should<br> get into today.<br> I'm not ready yet.<br> Okay, the statute of frauds<br> was passed in 1677.<br> It was called An Act<br> for the Prevention...<br> of Frauds or Perjuries.<br> I said<br> I'm not ready yet.<br> We can't wait for you.<br> Who the hell<br> do you think you are?<br> King bow tie shit?<br> You don't run things around here.<br> You don't run me.<br> The statute of frauds is,<br> in some form or another...<br> the law in almost every<br> state in the union.<br> You're giving everyone<br> a pain in the ass.<br> If you don't<br> like things, leave.<br> We can get along very well<br> without your outline.<br> I don't know how well<br> you're gonna do without ours.<br> Shut up.<br> Just shut up.<br> Okay.

I guess that's not<br> the crucial passage.<br> Mr. Hart.<br> The correct rule...<br> and the one in which<br> this case was decided is:<br> "In an ambiguous<br> set of facts...<br> "the party who creates<br> the ambiguity...<br> "and tries to use it<br> to his own advantage...<br> shall have the ambiguity<br> resolved against him."<br> Now, if both parties<br> are equally blameless...<br> what rules then?<br> Who should bear the burden<br> of the financial loss?<br> Miss Farranti.<br> Where the parties<br> are both blameless...<br> the court should place<br> the burden of loss...<br> on the party who can<br> most easily bear it.<br> Normally, the party in<br> the best financial position.<br> Oh, God! Kevin's party!<br> Ford!<br> Oh, shit.<br> Ford!<br> Hey, 8:00 tonight<br> was Kevin's birthday.<br> Want to go?<br> No. I wasn't invited.<br> Look, I'm inviting you.<br> Asheley asked me to invite the whole<br> study group, but I forgot.<br> Look, it's 9:15.<br> The party's over.<br> Oh, shit!<br> So I've got possibilities<br> with a couple of New York firms...<br> and, uh... but I want to<br> spend the summer...<br> Hey, Anderson.<br> I'm sorry, Asheley, but, uh,<br> I forgot about the party.<br> There isn't any party.<br> Kevin tried<br> to kill himself.<br> I'm having a baby,<br> and he tried to kill himself.<br> Where is he?<br> He's upstairs.<br> Kevin!<br> Please...<br> take it out<br> of the house.<br> Please.<br> Take it and leave.<br> I'm sorry, Kevin.<br> Get out.<br> It is clear that<br> under such circumstances...<br> the defendant's promise<br> to pay Neilson's debt...<br> was without consideration.<br> Mr. Hart, what do you think<br> of Mr. O'Connor's argument?<br> Mr. Hart?<br> Mr. Bell, what do you think<br> of Mr. O'Connor's argument?<br> Mr. Bell?<br> I'm sorry. What?<br> Do you find Mr. O'Connor's<br> argument convincing?<br> I don't find anything<br> Mr. O'Connor says convincing.<br> You know,<br> it always amazes me...<br> when law students<br> have a hard time.<br> I mean,<br> people like Kevin.<br> When you grow up with<br> my father, you get immune...<br> or insensitive to<br> certain kinds of things.<br> We used to own that house<br> over there, too...<br> but we sold it when<br> my grandfather died.<br> When he was still alive, we used<br> to shoot skeet from up here.<br> I don't know.<br> I sit in his class...<br> for days, I sit there.<br> I read his books<br> in the library...<br> I abstract the cases<br> he's chosen.<br> I know everything<br> about him...<br> His favorite ties,<br> how many suits he has.<br> You can say<br> he doesn't care...<br> but he's there anyway...<br> pounding his mind<br> into mine.<br> He screws around<br> with my life.<br> There's no way<br> you're ever gonna have...<br> a normal relationship<br> with him.<br> He won't permit it.<br> It's not part of the structure.<br> You must accept it and just try<br> and do things on your own.<br> I sit in the damn dining hall.<br> What do I hear?<br> I hear people telling<br> Kingsfield stories...<br> about how Kingsfield...<br> flattened<br> a particular student...<br> in a particular way.<br> It's like they're<br> telling Norse sagas...<br> like we're studying<br> theology instead of law.<br> So what the hell<br> are you gonna do?<br> You've gotta stand up.<br> You've gotta grow.<br> I can't explain it, but you've<br> just gotta stop being so soft...<br> so easily manipulated.<br> It's very dangerous<br> for one's intelligence.<br> I'm tired of hearing<br> about my father...<br> and I'm tired<br> of talking about him.<br> What about you? Aren't you tired<br> of sitting in that class taking shit?<br> Constitutional contracts...<br> marriage contracts...<br> historical contracts...<br> French contracts...<br> African tribal contracts...<br> religious contracts...<br> Now, Mr. Hart, can you<br> relate our next case...<br> to the summary<br> we've been building?<br> Thank you,<br> I prefer to pass.<br> What did you say?<br> Well, I have nothing relevant<br> to say concerning the case.<br> However, when I have<br> something relevant to say...<br> I shall raise my hand.<br> Mr. Hart, would you<br> step down here?<br> Mr. Hart, here's a dime.<br> Call your mother. Tell her<br> there's serious doubt...<br> about your becoming<br> a lawyer.<br> You...<br> are a son of a bitch,<br> Kingsfield!<br> Mr. Hart!<br> That is the most intelligent<br> thing you've said today.<br> You may take your seat.<br> I made extra copies<br> of my outlines for Kevin.<br> He can't possibly do well enough<br> to hurt any of us.<br> Kevin won't be needing<br> any copies.<br> He left school.<br> Kevin's outline.<br> He'd only done three pages.<br> I received it yesterday<br> in the mail.<br> Maybe you can get some<br> extra insight from it.<br> Well, I never did anything.<br> It was Bell who hated him.<br> I never said anything<br> against him.<br> Three left out of six.<br> Thank God Friday's<br> the last day of class.<br> I suggest that you particularly<br> address yourselves...<br> to the original text<br> of the statute of frauds...<br> and the uniform<br> commercial code.<br> Thank you.<br> Good luck<br> with your exam.<br> You'll need it.<br> Oh, say, listen, Hart, can you explain<br> that Swiss Atlantic case to me?<br> Yeah. Facts<br> aren't important.<br> Just remember<br> fundamental breach.<br> - Hart?<br> - Yeah?<br> - Can I drop by later on<br> and pick up some notes?<br> - Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay.<br> Hey, I'm getting out.<br> No way to study<br> in here anymore.<br> Can't you feel it?<br> Panic has descended.<br> I'm going somewhere else.<br> You wanna come?<br> We can study<br> someplace together.<br> Bet your ass I do.<br> Where the hell<br> are you going?<br> We're leaving. Where<br> is none of your business.<br> You can't pass<br> without my outline.<br> Okay,<br> then we won't pass.<br> Wait. I'll go get it!<br> Ford! Hart!<br> Look, I'll show it to you!<br> This is it!<br> Please don't go! Look at it!<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<br> How long you gentlemen<br> planning to stay?<br> Three days.<br> Front.<br> Get this damn thing<br> out of here.<br> Let's start with<br> civil procedure...<br> work our way<br> to contracts.<br> That way, it'll be fresh<br> in our minds Monday morning...<br> when we start the test.<br> Maid.<br> No, thanks.<br> They don't want<br> their beds changed.<br> Checked in two days ago,<br> and no one's even seen 'em.<br> Something funny's going on.<br> Number 4, murder.<br> "A," definition.<br> "Murder is the unlawful,<br> unjustified...<br> "and inexcusable killing<br> of a human being...<br> "by another human being<br> with malice aforethought.<br> "Malice aforethought...<br> "has a special<br> and particular meaning...<br> "apart from any other<br> definition of malice.<br> "It is a term used to cover...<br> five specific types<br> of intention."<br> All right,<br> let's suppose...<br> I'm beating you with<br> my fists unlawfully.<br> You've angered me...<br> I knock you down<br> on the floor...<br> and you get<br> impaled on a spike...<br> sticking up<br> out of the floor.<br> Uh, under the felony<br> murder rule...<br> I'm not guilty...<br> because a battery isn't<br> an ordinary felony.<br> Exceptions.<br> What...<br> What exceptions?<br> Uh, you...
