                        - Dinner will be ready in 15 minutes.<br> - Thank you, Leakin.<br> Inspector Ambrose is here,<br> madam.<br> - Show him in will you?<br> - Yes, madam.<br> - Good evening, Inspector.<br> - Good evening, Mrs Paradine.<br> This is Sergeant Leggott.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> I must say I'm surprised<br> to see you, Inspector.<br> I can't imagine anything<br> else you want from me.<br> I know, Mrs Paradine,<br> I know what you've been through...<br> but I'm here to arrest you.<br> That's incredible.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - Then you'll want me to go with you?<br> - Yes.<br> I'll tell them I won't need dinner.<br> Will you ring? The bell is there<br> beside the picture.<br> Do you like the picture?<br> It was finished a week<br> or two before he...<br> before he died.<br> I think the artist has caught<br> the blind man's look...<br> quite wonderfully.<br> Mrs Paradine, I have to use<br> some formal words.<br> Leakin, ask Helen for<br> my black coat and handbag.<br> I suppose if I need other clothes<br> they can be brought to me?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> - Well?<br> - I have a warrant for your arrest.<br> I warn you that you<br> need not say anything...<br> but that what you say will be taken<br> down and may be used in evidence.<br> The warrant charges you<br> that on 6 May 1946...<br> you administered, or caused<br> to be administered...<br> a poisonous substance to Richard<br> Patrick Paradine. And murdered him.<br> Leakin, I probably won't be back<br> this evening.<br> Very well, madam.<br> - Tell Cook I'm sorry about dinner.<br> - Yes, madam.<br> - Goodnight.<br> - Goodnight madam.<br> Yes, I know the country very well.<br> But it's so difficult<br> to get there...<br> - you can't go by car...<br> - In here sir.<br> Forgive me for being late.<br> I was dressing for dinner<br> when your call came.<br> - I took it in a bath towel.<br> - This is Chief Inspector Ambrose.<br> Sir Simon, my family solicitor.<br> Yes, we're old friends.<br> How are you, Inspector?<br> Well, thank you, Sir Simon.<br> We don't often see you here.<br> You must excuse an old man.<br> I'm not very keen on this place.<br> We'll get out as soon as possible,<br> Mrs Paradine. As soon as possible.<br> When you're ready, we'll make<br> the formal charge.<br> - Do you want another room?<br> - That's not necessary.<br> Just give me<br> a couple of minutes here.<br> Now, let's not waste words.<br> I know the police are making<br> a terrible mistake.<br> We mustn't despair. Above all,<br> we mustn't despair.<br> - You're not despairing, are you?<br> - No, Sir Simon.<br> Let me see.<br> They'll read the charge...<br> and ask if you've anything to say.<br> You'd better say "No".<br> Quite simply: "No".<br> Understood?<br> All right then.<br> Madelena Paradine...<br> the charge is that you,<br> on 6 May 1946...<br> did wilfully murder Richard Patrick<br> Irving Paradine.<br> Do you wish to say anything?<br> - I have nothing to say.<br> - That's all we can do.<br> I'll tell your maid to put together<br> some of things.<br> - You're allowed a few things.<br> - Who'll defend me? You?<br> At the trial?<br> No. Of course not.<br> I'll get you a distinguished leader<br> of The Bar.<br> - You know Anthony Keane?<br> - I've heard of him.<br> He's good in this sort of thing...<br> full of charm and cunning.<br> But juries like him. So do I.<br> - Won't it be difficult to get him?<br> - We'll see.<br> He's on a case in Lincoln now.<br> I'll go down and talk to him.<br> You'll like him.<br> It's not as important as his<br> liking me, is it?<br> I think he will.<br> Goodnight.<br> Goodnight.<br> Goodnight.<br> Would you come this way,<br> please?<br> - Think it over, Keane.<br> - I will, Simmie, I will.<br> - Evening, Baker.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Tony?<br> - Yes, my love?<br> I knew it. You didn't have an<br> umbrella or raincoat. Oh, darling.<br> You're wet through Tony. Baker,<br> will you bring up the cocktails?<br> - You might ask me if I won.<br> - You always win.<br> Even if you don't come home dry.<br> Simmie's car, it leaks.<br> Come and have a hot shower.<br> I'll make your drink strong.<br> We may pull through.<br> - Simmie wants me to take a case.<br> - Oh?<br> Mrs Paradine.<br> - I don't believe she did it.<br> - Could you tell me why?<br> As her lawyer, I could use<br> any bit of evidence.<br> Nice people don't murder<br> other nice people.<br> So you think she's nice.<br> Her photograph looks nice.<br> If not, she wouldn't have married<br> that poor blind man.<br> Here you are.<br> - Just right.<br> - Good.<br> So nice people never murder<br> their husbands?<br> I suppose<br> there are circumstances.<br> It's amazing how 11 years with<br> the greatest realist in the country...<br> haven't altered your lovely<br> delusions about nice people.<br> I'm glad you're defending her.<br> - Why?<br> - Well... Your hair's wet. I'll rub it.<br> - Not so hard.<br> - It's nice you can help others.<br> Even save their lives.<br> But you've changed. 11 years ago<br> you wouldn't have taken this case.<br> Nonsense, I never turn down<br> a big fee. Then or now.<br> You'd have taken it, but only after<br> sneering at the decadence of the rich.<br> I hardly recognise my lost ideals.<br> I remember the first time<br> you called on me...<br> with 2 tickets for that Shaw play.<br> Remember?<br> You'd forgotten to dress. The look on<br> Mother's face as we left the house.<br> It took you 5 years<br> to forgive that look.<br> It took her 50 years<br> to perfect that look.<br> You're reasonably dry.<br> You better get dressed.<br> - I'm not really mental.<br> - I know you're not.<br> If I didn't pretend, I couldn't<br> live with so brilliant a man.<br> I use that sort of talk<br> only on juries.<br> - Does it actually work?<br> - Come here.<br> - No, we've guests for dinner.<br> - Come here.<br> No, Tony.<br> She's a strange woman,<br> with an almost mystic calm.<br> - How do you do, Sir Simon?<br> - Here's the great man. Mrs Paradine.<br> May I present Mr Keane.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do, Mrs Paradine?<br> You may take heart now.<br> We've got the Marines on our side.<br> - You'll defend me?<br> - The Marines don't expect trouble.<br> A brief skirmish, and you'll be<br> lunching at the Savoy.<br> Really? I haven't been thinking<br> about the Savoy.<br> - I know what you've been thinking.<br> - Do you?<br> Yes. Dark thoughts like:<br> "Death, where is thy sting?<br> - Grave where is thy victory"?<br> - I keep hearing them...<br> All the time. Saying I married<br> a blind man for money.<br> Then killed him for money.<br> And what will they say of Dickie?<br> It makes him such a fool<br> for loving me.<br> We'll have the answers.<br> You loved him and he needed you.<br> - You know that?<br> - Weren't you his eyes?<br> Of course, I had to be.<br> Had to be, Mrs Paradine?<br> Had to be?<br> You must mind your verbs.<br> He means it was voluntary service.<br> You devoted your whole life to him.<br> Freely. Gladly.<br> Yes. I see what you mean.<br> It was a sacrifice.<br> A sublime sacrifice.<br> Yes, it's better to see it<br> in that light.<br> What's more, Paradine<br> couldn't understand.<br> Couldn't understand your sacrifice.<br> He'd never seen you.<br> - He'd never seen you.<br> - Yes, quite so, quite so.<br> I'm not sure if Mr Keane will put you<br> in the witness box. If he does...<br> We needn't trouble Mrs Paradine<br> with that now.<br> When shall I see you again?<br> As soon as I've gone<br> over the details.<br> - Thank you deeply.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> Thankyou for bringing him.<br> Until the next time, then.<br> Come along, Keane.<br> So you think Tony<br> was taken with her?<br> Let's not go on<br> a fishing expedition.<br> All right, don't tell me.<br> Tony may be a good lawyer...<br> but he loves anything dramatic.<br> Hold still if you want<br> this thing tied.<br> The impertinence of young people<br> today is appalling.<br> - If there's one thing I can't abide...<br> - I know. It's impertinence.<br> Tony will give another<br> great performance.<br> Riding to the rescue of beauty<br> in distress.<br> How he must relish this.<br> If the case is before Hawfield,<br> he'd better not try a performance...<br> or he'll be sat upon. Properly.<br> Gracious, we're late.<br> Hawfield will take it out on Sophie.<br> Let's not miss a word of his<br> Lordship's reminiscences.<br> If I hear once more of his times<br> in Deuxville with lady so-and-so...<br> Remarkable old girl, Lady Millicent.<br> We had great times together.<br> Deuxville, back in the twenties.<br> I persuaded her to go swimming at 70.<br> I watched her and had sad thoughts<br> about the impermanence of beauty.<br> Have you swallowed a plum stone?<br> No Tommy, I'm all right.<br> I only... I mean...<br> I mean, I thought perhaps...<br> Don't be too long you men.<br> This is so antiquated...<br> - but he likes it.<br> - He won't keep us away too long.<br> Call me, if the conversation<br> takes an interesting turn.<br> I see you haven't forgotten<br> my deaf ear.<br> Keane's too good a barrister<br> to have forgotten.<br> Sometimes I wonder how good<br> you really are.<br> - Good enough, or lucky enough.<br> - Come, come. No false modesty.<br> - There aren't many better.<br> - Perhaps. But I'm a legalist myself.<br> You have the habit using emotion<br> with the jury.<br> I must confess I don't think<br> it's proper.<br> Come, come. Keane's not<br> that emotional.<br> Don't interrupt me in the middle of<br> an insult. Will you have a cigar?<br> You understand that I'm just<br> concerned for you.<br> - Will you have a cigar?<br> - No, thank you.<br> Tommy has a great opinion<br> of your husband.<br> At least I think he has.<br> - Your husband is clever, isn't he?<br> - Yes.<br> - I think so.<br> - So's mine. I'm not sure I like it.<br> Shall I hurry them up?<br> They'll be all night...<br> if someone doesn't ring a bell.<br> I shouldn't tell you this...<br> but I dread it when he takes<br> a murder trial.<br> He comes home looking so...<br> Yes, I can well imagine.<br> It must be a terrible strain...<br> trying a capital charge.<br> Yes, that's very comforting.<br> They were retrying Charles I,<br> and Tony got him off.<br> You've been such a long time.<br> I've been chattering and chattering.<br> My dear, I'm sure Keane and Simmie<br> would like to see your jade.<br> Would they? I have some<br> pretty pieces.<br> Very much indeed.<br> You look very appetising tonight.<br> A charming complement from such<br> a gourmet, Lord Hawfield.<br> Tell me, Mrs Keane...<br> I don't amuse you very much,<br> do I?<br> I've always admired your wit.<br> You may call upon my wit<br> whenever you wish.<br> Life can be very boring<br> for grass widows.<br> What makes you think<br> I'm a grass widow?<br> Don't let's be pedantic.<br> Golf widows, stock-exchange widows<br> and law-court widows...<br> are the same thing.<br> Charming ruby.<br> Did your husband earn all that<br> whacking away at juries?<br> Lady Hawfield was admiring it too.<br> It pleased me because she has<br> such excellent taste...<br> in most things.<br> Keane, I'm afraid your wife<br> is wearying of me.<br> Pity.<br> - Are you coming to bed?<br> - In a little while, dear.<br> You'll be tired in the morning.<br> - Dull evening, wasn't it?<br> - Yes, I know.<br> I've a murderous day tomorrow.<br> I shoudn't have let Simmie talk me<br> into a new case.<br> Did you see Mrs Paradine?<br> What's she like?<br> Strangely attractive.<br> I'm sure you'd think so anyway.<br> - No, I wouldn't.<br> - What do you mean?<br> She's cost me too much.<br> Cost you?<br> What are you talking about?<br> If you don't remember,<br> I won't tell you.<br> The anniversary trip I promised.<br> We'll still make it.<br> Maybe before the case<br> comes to trial.<br> It's all right darling.<br> Your excitement will always be<br> the Old Bailey...<br> - and other musty law courts.<br> - Honestly, I was thinking today...<br> how much fun<br> it'd be to go to Italy.<br> - Italy? I thought it was Switzerland.<br> - I know.<br> But Italy seems<br> much more colourful.<br> Might go back to Venice.<br> Get in a gondola.<br> Darling.<br> - What's the matter? What's amusing?<br> - Nothing.<br> I can't imagine anything better than<br> being in a gondola again with you.<br> - What is it then?<br> - It's just that you're so...<br> so transparent.<br> And for such a devious kind of<br> barrister, too.<br> You're pretty devious yourself.<br> Come on, tell the jury<br> what's on your mind.<br> All right. Mrs Paradine is<br> "strangely attractive".<br> And isn't Italy colourful?<br> Idiotic nonsense!<br> I thought you might be pleased<br> I can be jealous.<br> It isn't that. How can you think<br> I could be interested...?<br> Of course you're not interested.<br> I hope you're not so old you can't<br> admire an attractive woman.<br> But I want you to know something.<br> Lots of men find me attractive too.<br> Is that so? Who, for instance?<br> - Well, there's Tommy, for instance.<br> - Tommy?<br> Tommy Hawfield.<br> It's getting late.<br> Time we were in the gondola.<br> That's enough for today.<br> Are they treating you well?<br> - Yes, they're very kind.<br> - Do you want any books?<br> - No, they have a good library.<br> - Good, good.<br> Soon, I'd like to talk to you<br> about yourself.<br> Before you met Colonel Paradine.<br> - Will that be necessary?<br> - It's annoying...<br> Prosecution try to tear down<br> the defendant's character.<br> I wouldn't like them to have<br> the advantage on me.<br> My past is no affair of anyone<br> but my husband and myself.<br> And my husband is dead.<br> The defendant's background<br> is important to the defence.<br> And how far back will this<br> inquisition go?<br> As much as I dislike it,<br> I must advise you to tell me...<br> anything you think might be...<br> embarrassing.<br> I must say, it's essential<br> I have your co-operation.<br> Forgive me if I'm being difficult.<br> I shall try. It won't shock you,<br> I assume...<br> to learn that I am a woman...<br> who has seen a great deal of life.<br> Please don't mistake my persistance<br> for any lack of sympathy.<br> When I was still at school in Naples<br> it began.<br> I was 16, or so I said.<br> Actually I was younger.<br> - Tragic.<br> - Yes, perhaps.<br> But I didn't think so then.<br> I ran away with a man.<br> Istambul, Athens, Cairo.<br> He was much older, of course? Rich.<br> He took advantage of your youth.<br> He was married, respected.<br> I took advantage of him.<br> Then, as suddenly as it began,<br> it ended.<br> He wearied of me, and me of him.<br> What difference does it make?<br> There were others?<br> Of course.<br> We cannot hide these things.<br> You said so.<br> Let's drag them out.<br> Let them hang me for the past.<br> No. You mustn't feel that. We won't<br> let them make anything of it.<br> Poor Dickie. He would've hated<br> all this.<br> He gave me his name, his fine name.<br> He depended on me to protect it.<br> He knew all about you?<br> I kept nothing from him.<br> He was so good. He trusted me.<br> He used to sit in the dark,<br> the eternal dark...<br> - and weep. The pain...<br> - I've tortured you enough.<br> We'll get you free.<br> Trust me.<br> I shall.<br> I do.<br> Why not let The Crown have to prove<br> its accusations?<br> What objection can you have<br> to proving suicide?<br> I think it's dangerous. Remember,<br> if Hawfield's on the bench...<br> You all have such an unholy fear<br> of Hawfield.<br> What's on your mind, Keane?<br> I don't understand you.<br> Blind men have<br> committed suicide before.<br> We have only to decide<br> who helped Paradine to do it.<br> Here, let me show you something.<br> Do you realise what you can learn<br> from photographs?<br> The social footsteps of time.<br> - Notice anything peculiar?<br> - No, can't say that I do.<br> And everywhere<br> the Paradines went...<br> - the valet was sure to go.<br> - What's extraordinary about that?<br> LaTour worshipped him.<br> Guided Paradine's every step.<br> Like a mother hen.<br> - It's after midnight.<br> - I know it's after midnight.<br> It's after one, I heard the clock.<br> - But I'm not sleepy. I have to work.<br> - Simmie looks dead.<br> - Well, he isn't dead.<br> - Quite right, I only look dead.<br> - What about some drinks?<br> - Good idea. Have Baker bring...<br> Baker's asleep.<br> Like any civilised person.<br> I'll bring them myself.<br> - That's our man. I'm sure of it.<br> - Our man? Who?<br> - The valet?<br> - Who more likely...<br> - to help Paradine out of his misery?<br> - Forget it. There's noone less likely.<br> The devoted servant and war<br> companion...<br> who'd do anything to help end<br> his master's agony.<br> It won't wash Tony.<br> Let's face it:<br> This wasn't suicide, or assisted<br> suicide, it was murder.<br> - Are you saying LaTour murdered him?<br> - I'm not talking about LaTour.<br> - Who then?<br> - I'm talking about our client.<br> - So you think she killed him?<br> - It's what they'll try to prove.<br> There's no sense going into court<br> hurling other names into the case.<br> We have to prepare to answer<br> the Crown on Mrs Paradine.<br> - I'll have an answer.<br> - With facts?<br> To begin, we've the obvious fact<br> that Mrs Paradine isn't a murderess.<br> - She's too fine a woman.<br> - Indeed?<br> I thought she was a woman<br> of very low estate.<br> Of rather easy virtue.<br> You're an insufferable snob.<br> Incapable of recognising<br> genuine character.<br> I hope the Crown tries to foul<br> her name once. Just once.<br> I'm sorry, I didn't realise<br> how she'd impressed you.<br> I've talked to her for hours and I've<br> done more than hear words...<br> I've seen the decent,<br> lovely woman behind them.<br> I intend the world<br> to see her as I do.<br> As a noble self-sacrificing person<br> any man would be proud of.<br> We've...<br> run out of soda water.<br> Ordinary water will do.<br> Shall I pour yours, Sim?<br> Please, a strong one.<br> La Tour worshipped the Colonel.<br> That's true isn't it?<br> He was alone with him,<br> day and night.<br> So if the Colonel, blind, helpless,<br> wanted to die...<br> there was only one person he could<br> turn to, isn't that right?<br> - I won't say that.<br> - You won't say what?<br> - That Andre helped him.<br> - Andre.<br> LaTour.<br> You call him Andre, the valet?<br> I'm not trained in the subtle<br> snobberies of your class.<br> My class? You don't know me<br> very well.<br> I know you.<br> Always ready to sacrifice<br> an underdog to win a point.<br> You're very eager<br> to protect this man.<br> From even<br> suspicion of involvement.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - You talk about LaTour as if...<br> As if what?<br> I'm confused by your attitude to<br> LaTour. You speak his name oddly.<br> This is impossible.<br> I'll not listen to any more<br> vicious innuendos.<br> You spoke as my rescuer.<br> Talked about a brief skirmish.<br> Yes, so I did.<br> I'll try to recover my position<br> as your champion.<br> We'll drop LaTour for now.<br> Keane's given up the idea of<br> dragging the valet into the suicide.<br> He hasn't been able to talk<br> Mrs Paradine into it.<br> Has he got a substitute?<br> Or is he going to follow your advice?<br> I don't know.<br> - He's turning detective.<br> - What do you mean?<br> He's going to Cumberland to<br> investigate Paradine's country house.<br> But the thing happened in London.<br> I'm bored with this game,<br> let's finish it later.<br> The adventures of Anthony Keane<br> are much more interesting.<br> I don't know where you got<br> this unfeminine interest in things.<br> Your mother was a simple woman,<br> who'd shudder at the thought...<br> I'm glad your not going on with<br> the game. You nearly had me.<br> - Is Tony infatuated with that woman?<br> - What?<br> Where do you get<br> such insane ideas?<br> Tell me, why is Hindley Hall<br> still open?<br> It's not open. There's the<br> housekeeper...<br> What plot<br> are you concocting now?<br> Is that handsome valet still there?<br> No more questions. If you won't<br> play chess, go to bed.<br> I'll bet there's something between<br> Mrs Paradine and that valet.<br> Valet? Where did you get<br> that notion?<br> Why are you looking so funny?<br> Did you have the same idea?<br> I wondered if he could've<br> found out...<br> That she and the valet...<br> That's it. He's jealous.<br> - He's jealous of that valet.<br> - Oh come, come.<br> Don't come, come me. Have you ever<br> known Tony visit a jail so often?<br> Tony is still in love with Gay.<br> And why shouldn't he be?<br> If he lets Gay down,<br> after all these years...<br> Such things do happen.<br> I'm sorry to tell you...<br> but your education was paid for<br> by many a broken heart.<br> - He's in love with that woman.<br> - Oh, get off my lap.<br> I've never seen it to fail.<br> Men who've been good too long,<br> long to wallow in the mud.<br> Where did you read that? Tony's too<br> decent for that sort of thing.<br> Really? The best men always end up<br> with the worst women.<br> He's after her boyfriend. That's<br> why he's going to Cumberland.<br> - That's absurd.<br> - Don't you think I'm right?<br> Answer me.<br> I'll not be treated as a hostile<br> witness by my own flesh and blood.<br> Men are such horrible beasts.<br> I wish I were married to Keane.<br> I'd make him jump through hoops.<br> I wish you were married to someone.<br> Perhaps he could put up with you.<br> I hope... No, I don't hope<br> they hang her.<br> I don't like breaking pretty things.<br> But I do hope they send her<br> to prison for life.<br> What's she really like?<br> Fascinating. Fascinating.<br> I'm an old ruin, but she brings<br> my pulse up a beat or two.<br> Poor Gay.<br> - Hello, Tony.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> - You're late.<br> - I told you not to wait up for me.<br> I wasn't.<br> Well, I'll be off to bed.<br> Goodnight, darling.<br> Tony?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> - I'm sorry if I...<br> don't seem quite myself...<br> I have a headache.<br> I'm sorry you're not feeling well.<br> I'm a bit on the ragged side myself.<br> Tony, couldn't we get away?<br> Just for a little while?<br> You do need a rest.<br> I've never seen you<br> quite like this before.<br> - Just a good night's sleep.<br> - Even if only for a few days.<br> For our anniversary.<br> You did promise.<br> Some things are more important<br> than anniversaries.<br> You didn't use to think so.<br> In fact, I may have to go away.<br> The Paradines lived a lot of the time<br> at Hindley Hall, in Cumberland.<br> I thought I might<br> nose around a bit.<br> See what I can pick up.<br> And get a breath of fresh air.<br> That sounds wonderful. You won't be<br> busy all the time, we can...<br> It's only for a day or two.<br> It wouldn't be any fun for you.<br> You see that, don't you?<br> Yes, I see.<br> It might be cold and wet up north.<br> Yes, I suppose so.<br> This is the place for you.<br> Warm, cosy, protected.<br> I want to keep all this ugly business<br> away from you.<br> - But can you?<br> - Can I what?<br> Keep the ugliness away?<br> Haven't I always?<br> What do you mean?<br> What are you afraid of?<br> Need I say?<br> Listen, this settles it. Nothing is<br> worth trouble between us.<br> I won't go to Cumberland. I won't<br> go on with the case. I'll give it up.<br> - Tony.<br> - Simmie can get someone else.<br> - But what will she say?<br> - What the devil does it...<br> matter what she says?<br> The case isn't so difficult.<br> Any of 50 men can handle it.<br> Is that what you want? We'll leave<br> for Switzerland. Tomorrow perhaps.<br> - Darling.<br> - What's the matter now?<br> Nothing's the matter. Just thank you.<br> Thank you...<br> for being so good.<br> I knew my old Tony couldn't have<br> changed that much.<br> Well, what do you say?<br> Lausanne or Saint Moritz?<br> No, darling, neither. You're<br> going up to Cumberland...<br> then you're coming back<br> and going to court.<br> No, I am tired. You're right.<br> You're not too tired, Tony.<br> You're not too tired.<br> There aren't 50 men<br> who can save her.<br> There's only one Anthony Keane.<br> You've always had such big ideas<br> about me.<br> No I haven't. Besides,<br> I have a stake in this too.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> I wouldn't like a woman to be<br> hanged, any woman...<br> just because my husband had<br> a rendezvous with her.<br> In jail.<br> Oh, Gay.<br> Let's go to bed darling.<br> Not now.<br> - You'll come up to Cumberland?<br> - I'll be waiting here.<br> Cosy, comfortable and protected.<br> Goodnight darling.<br> Goodnight.<br> - Have I a sitting room?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Do you want to see it?<br> - Yes, please.<br> Would you like some fish and salad<br> before you go to bed?<br> No, thank you. Any chance of<br> a whiskey and soda?<br> Okey-doke.<br> Your bedroom's number 17,<br> I'll have your bags sent up.<br> Thank you.<br> - Are you a detective?<br> - No, why?<br> - Oh, I just wondered.<br> - Why do you ask?<br> - Have you had trouble here?<br> - No, not exactly here.<br> But we don't like<br> being in the Sunday papers.<br> Haven't you heard about<br> the poisoning case?<br> That was Colonel Paradine.<br> He had Hindley Hall.<br> Your fire's going out.<br> - Yes, I heard about that.<br> - This chimney won't draw.<br> We found a dead owl in it.<br> That murder's been the talk of the<br> place. Mrs Paradine did it, they say.<br> That's better. The sticks were damp<br> and the wind's in the wrong way.<br> - Did you know her?<br> - Nobody knew her.<br> She'd ride over here once in a while<br> on her black hunter.<br> Pleasant enough,<br> but she never spoke to no-one.<br> - Did she always ride alone?<br> - That's got it.<br> Yes, now I come to think of it,<br> she always was alone.<br> And now the Colonel's dead<br> and the house is up to let.<br> I heard it was. That's why<br> I came in fact.<br> Oh, that's why you're here.<br> I was wondering.<br> - Will you see the house tomorrow?<br> - Yes. I think so.<br> Would you mind the pony and trap?<br> Our car's all booked up for tomorrow.<br> - It's only about 8 miles.<br> - Fine. Make it about 10 o'clock.<br> Okey-doke.<br> Up there in those trees is the hall.<br> Where the poor Colonel lived.<br> Many times I've seen him out<br> walking, blind as he was. With Andre.<br> - Andre?<br> - Andre LaTour, the Colonel's servant.<br> The queer one.<br> - Is anyone living at the hall now?<br> - Only the caretaker, Mrs Clark.<br> Maybe Andre's back<br> from London now.<br> They say he knows more about<br> the Colonel's death than he'll tell.<br> He's a queer one all right.<br> - In what way?<br> - I don't know.<br> He keeps himself to himself.<br> Perhaps it's because he's foreign.<br> Never seem quite the same,<br> do they?<br> Hey, LaTour. Here's a gentleman from<br> London with an order to see the hall.<br> - I'm interested in renting the house.<br> - In renting the house, Mr Keane?<br> Will you come in please?<br> If you'll wait here Mr Keane,<br> I'll open the shutters.<br> - Isn't he coming back?<br> - He might and he might not, sir.<br> Will you step this way?<br> This is the morning room,<br> the poor Colonel's favourite room.<br> It has a fine view, sir.<br> He loved her to describe it...<br> each time the seasons changed.<br> - Did she...<br> - I'll show you the upstairs, sir.<br> And this was her room, sir.<br> I'm sorry it's so untidy,<br> I was packing up her things.<br> If you'll excuse me,<br> I'll open up the other rooms.<br> LaTour.<br> - Sir?<br> - I should like to see the gardens.<br> - Would you take me round?<br> - Very good, sir.<br> Wait there for me,<br> I'll be down immediately.<br> Don't bother with the other rooms.<br> LaTour's going to show me the garden.<br> Very well, sir.<br> What door's that?<br> It's LaTour's room.<br> LaTour? Why wasn't he<br> in the servants'quarters?<br> She felt he should be near<br> the Colonel.<br> Well, I may drop in again to...<br> tomorrow.<br> - Where's LaTour?<br> - I couldn't say sir.<br> - But he was to show me the garden.<br> - He was called away.<br> All right, back to the inn.<br> Can I have a word with you, sir?<br> Come in.<br> - What can I do for you?<br> - It's not an easy question to answer.<br> - How did you know this was my room?<br> - I saw you come up from the lake.<br> And then this light go on.<br> - You've been watching the inn?<br> - Yes, I walked over from Hindley.<br> - To see me?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> It came to my mind it would be well<br> to see you.<br> Sit down.<br> Why didn't you come to the front<br> door? Why come in the back way?<br> They'd all gone to bed. I didn't<br> want to disturb the household.<br> - But you might have come earlier.<br> - I didn't care to come earlier, sir.<br> - Why not?<br> - I'll leave that to you, sir.<br> - What is it you want with me?<br> - Beg pardon...<br> but I thought it was you<br> wanted to see me.<br> - What caused you to think that?<br> - Well, you came to the hall.<br> I didn't come to the hall to see you.<br> I came to see the house.<br> But you asked me<br> to show you the garden.<br> Yes. You said you would and then<br> you shot out of sight like a rabbit.<br> Why?<br> I don't know.<br> I think first: "No, I do not want<br> to talk to him."<br> And then I think perhaps I'm wrong.<br> Remember this LaTour:<br> You forced yourself on me.<br> I didn't seek you out.<br> You're going to be a very hostile<br> witness in this case.<br> And you're not<br> one of my witnesses.<br> And it would be most improper<br> for me to...<br> try to establish contact with you.<br> - I came on you entirely by chance.<br> - But you wanted to come on me, sir.<br> You say so,<br> but it's my job...<br> to save the life<br> of your former mistress.<br> Beg pardon.<br> She was not my mistress.<br> Colonel Paradine was my master.<br> Have it your own way.<br> I would never<br> have served a woman.<br> It's not in my character to do that.<br> I insist upon knowing your reason<br> for wanting to see me tonight.<br> If you tell me why you came<br> from London...<br> I'll tell you why I came here.<br> So it's to be a bargain is it?<br> Why should I<br> make a bargain with you?<br> Call it what you like.<br> All I say is:<br> You tell me and I'll tell you.<br> Seems fair enough to me.<br> Cigarette?<br> - No, thank you, sir.<br> - You don't smoke?<br> I won't smoke, sir. Thank you.<br> I know why you wanted to see me:<br> She sent you.<br> She? Mrs Paradine doesn't know I'm<br> here. She had nothing to do with it.<br> - Seems I'm wrong then.<br> - Why would she send me?<br> She might have her reasons.<br> - I don't know what they might be.<br> - Perhaps you don't know her as I do.<br> Mrs Paradine is my client. I know her<br> as her lawyer. That's sufficient.<br> You may not think it, but you're<br> on the wrong side sir.<br> - And I tell you so.<br> - What do you mean exactly, by that?<br> You'd better make yourself clear.<br> Excuse me. You've only known her<br> since she's in prison.<br> Is it not so?<br> Then how can you know her?<br> If you did,<br> I'd not need to tell you...<br> that only Almighty God...<br> or the Devil himself<br> knows what's in her head.<br> - I won't hear any more against her.<br> - I know what I'm talking about.<br> What I say is true.<br> I know her.<br> And I will tell you one thing more.<br> I will tell you about Mrs Paradine.<br> She's bad, bad to the bone.<br> If ever there was an evil woman...<br> she is one.<br> Would you mind<br> getting out of here?<br> I don't want any dirty,<br> lying sneaks in my room.<br> - Get out.<br> - Very good sir, as you wish.<br> But if you'll allow me sir...<br> I'm very sorry for you.<br> God help you.<br> - Here you are, sir.<br> - Holloway Prison.<br> - How are you?<br> - I thought you'd forgotten me.<br> I've been out of London.<br> I went up to Hindley Hall.<br> Why did you go there?<br> I thought it'd help me to know<br> more about your background.<br> I walked on the terrace, went<br> into the house, into your room.<br> I saw LaTour.<br> He behaved very strangely.<br> He avoided me then forced himself<br> on me. Came to my room late at night.<br> - Why did he do that?<br> - He wanted to talk to me.<br> About you.<br> Indeed. And what did my husband's<br> valet have to say about me?<br> Don't, I beg of you, don't<br> behave this way with me.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> LaTour hates you. You know that?<br> He hates you most bitterly.<br> He said you're an evil woman.<br> Do you know<br> what he meant by that?<br> This man despises you. Why?<br> - He despises all women.<br> - What's the good of telling me that?<br> It's you he hates,<br> not all women.<br> The jury will find a reason for it:<br> Something you did to his master.<br> - Can't you see that?<br> - Of course I see.<br> You needn't explain these things<br> as though I were a child.<br> Listen to me.<br> I want to save you.<br> I want to fight for you.<br> But I can't like this,<br> in the dark.<br> I can't sleep, I can't work,<br> I can't think, I...<br> I don't understand you.<br> All right.<br> Is it possible that<br> LaTour hates you...<br> because you made him<br> disloyal to his master?<br> - That's enough Mr Keane.<br> - What existed between you and LaTour?<br> I will not be treated this way<br> by my own counsellor.<br> I'd prefer you<br> to give up the case.<br> No, I must save you. No-one else can.<br> My personal feelings are such that...<br> Forgive me if I regard<br> my life as more important.<br> I apologise. Deeply.<br> If you'll forgive me, I...<br> I'll do my best to defend you.<br> I'm a little tired.<br> I think you also are a little tired.<br> Tony back from Cumberland?<br> - Sorry Judy, what did you say?<br> - Just making conversation.<br> I asked if Tony was back<br> from Cumberland.<br> He was due back this mornng.<br> I haven't seen him yet.<br> Give me a cigarette will you Judy?<br> - When did you start smoking?<br> - Just lately.<br> Poor Father, I'm afraid he's failed<br> with me in every way.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - 20 years he's been telling me:<br> "Do not ask questions,<br> leave others to tell you.<br> Only vulgar people probe."<br> You're my best friend, Judy.<br> Ask anything you wish.<br> You must know<br> what everyone's saying.<br> I know it's probably exaggerated...<br> Would it surprise you Judy, to know<br> he wanted to give up the case?<br> Surprise me? It'd floor me.<br> Why didn't he then?<br> Because I wouldn't let him.<br> Suppose someone else<br> had taken the case.<br> It would've been won or lost.<br> Either way...<br> the little romance of Gay and Tony<br> Keane would have ended forever.<br> Perhaps so.<br> Judy, just because a man, a husband,<br> fancies another woman...<br> you don't treat him as a criminal.<br> - You don't.<br> - I doubt you would either.<br> It's very painful, but it's<br> painful for him too.<br> He's very fond of me,<br> and I'd like to keep him so.<br> Even if it means letting him go?<br> No, simply by not making him<br> suffer for hurting me.<br> After all, I don't own him.<br> I only love him.<br> - Hello, Baker, Mrs Keane home?<br> - I'm in here, Tony.<br> Hello, darling.<br> You're just in time for tea.<br> Well, pour me a cup, will you?<br> - How was the journey?<br> - Not very interesting.<br> - You're doing your hair a new way.<br> - No.<br> You've seen it like this<br> hundreds of times.<br> - Would you rather I didn't talk?<br> - What do you mean?<br> Nothing. It's just you look tired.<br> No, there's really nothing to tell.<br> It's a big house. Rather what you'd<br> expect. You know the Lake District.<br> Oh, Tony.<br> What is it you...<br> want to know about?<br> Nothing, actually I...<br> Shall we dine early or would you<br> like to sleep for a bit?<br> I suppose you hate her,<br> don't you?<br> Let's not talk about it Tony.<br> I'm trying hard and I'm hoping...<br> You're hoping that I'll<br> lose the case.<br> I wouldn't blame you, darling.<br> No matter what you hoped for.<br> You've been my life, Tony.<br> And for such a long time.<br> Do you think I could ever want<br> anything bad for you?<br> No, I suppose not.<br> I won't deny there've been moments<br> when I've wished the worst for her.<br> It's not easy to face<br> the thought of...<br> losing you.<br> We've been really married.<br> Really truly married.<br> As few people have been.<br> Yes, I've lain awake alone,<br> night after night.<br> And I've been tempted to pray...<br> But I've come to a conclusion,<br> Tony.<br> I want her to live.<br> I want very much for her to live.<br> And I hope she gets free, scot free.<br> Free to kill.<br> To take other husbands or anything<br> that comes into her beautiful head.<br> I don't understand. You can't really<br> care what happens to her.<br> But I do, I care very much.<br> Not for any noble reasons.<br> I do hate her.<br> But because I want<br> this to be over...<br> and an end to you being all mixed up,<br> part lawyer, part lover.<br> What nonsense. Nonsense.<br> All right. Frustrated lover then.<br> Yes, and part husband still.<br> You're not finished with me.<br> You wouldn't have come back<br> home today if you were.<br> I've seen your torture and...<br> I've loved you more for letting<br> it torture you.<br> - I know the depth of your feelings.<br> - Yes, Gay.<br> I know it and I'm counting on it.<br> All I ask is that she lives so the<br> fight can be an even one.<br> Because, if she dies...<br> you're lost to me forever.<br> You'll go on thinking<br> you love her...<br> imagining her as your<br> great lost love.<br> May I tell you something Tony?<br> You don't love her.<br> You don't. I'm not the cleverest<br> woman in the world...<br> I don't know lots of things.<br> But there's one thing I know better<br> than anyone else.<br> I know you.<br> - My dear, if only I...<br> - Don't say anything.<br> But I ask you for the most<br> brilliant job of your career.<br> I want you to win this case.<br> I want you to get her free.<br> There.<br> I've made my speech.<br> What a speech.<br> That's what comes from<br> being married to a lawyer.<br> I'm going up to change now.<br> - Are you coming?<br> - Yes, in a minute.<br> Are you ready, Mrs Paradine?<br> Silence. All persons<br> with anything to do...<br> before the courts<br> of the King's Justices...<br> take delivery of the jurisdiction<br> of the Central Criminal Court...<br> draw near,<br> and give your attendance.<br> - Wait here.<br> - God save the King.<br> Bring forth the prisoner.<br> Madelena Ana Paradine...<br> you're charged with the murder of<br> Richard Patrick Irving Paradine...<br> on May 6th last. Are you<br> guilty or not guilty?<br> Not guilty.<br> Gay, how can you stay away?<br> Tony won't see you. We'll be in the<br> gallery, just 2 more dim faces.<br> On the night of May 6th, at a time<br> we can fix to within a few minutes...<br> someone administered to Paradine<br> a murderous dose of poison.<br> At half past 9, he was heard<br> calling for help...<br> and a few minutes later<br> he died painfully...<br> before he could be reached by<br> his faithful servant...<br> Andre LaTour.<br> You'll hear that on the night<br> of May 6th a quarrel took place...<br> between Coronel Paradine...<br> Mrs Paradine<br> and Andre LaTour.<br> The Coronel, in an agitated state,<br> shut himself up in his bedroom alone.<br> The butler took<br> him his dinner...<br> a dinner of roast chicken,<br> roast potatoes...<br> and cauliflower au gratin.<br> Later...<br> he asked for a glass of burgundy<br> to be put by his bed...<br> so he would know exactly<br> where to feel for it.<br> A glass of burgundy,<br> ladies and gentlemen.<br> Farrell's off<br> to a good start.<br> You're aware<br> of the Coronel's character.<br> He was a man cast<br> in a heroic mould.<br> One looks back on his life<br> with humility and pride.<br> He was like a reincarnation from the<br> spacious days of Queen Elizabeth.<br> Incredibly daring,<br> inimitably adventurous...<br> and this man, this man<br> of dynamic energy...<br> is doomed suddenly to darkness<br> and the life of a helpless invalid.<br> Members of the jury, we must<br> surely pity this woman...<br> chained to a ruined giant, who was<br> burning with a dreadful resentment.<br> One could forgive an occasional<br> demonstration of impatience from her.<br> But the odd thing is that outwardly<br> this woman was a model of patience.<br> Heaven knows what sultry fires<br> were banked within.<br> It would've been a strain to any<br> ordinary woman, no doubt.<br> But this woman...<br> is no ordinary woman.<br> She had patience.<br> She could wait.<br> This was indeed...<br> no ordinary woman.<br> Leakin, after you served dinner to<br> Colonel Paradine in his bedroom...<br> he asked you for<br> a glass of burgundy.<br> - Is that correct?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Would you call that a suitable<br> bedtime drink? You as a butler?<br> No sir, I would not.<br> But the Colonel...<br> Answer my questions, please.<br> Had he ever asked for a burgundy<br> to be put by his bedside before?<br> - No sir, not that I can remember.<br> - Did he usually drink burgundy?<br> It usually didn't<br> agree with him...<br> - but sometime...<br> - That will do.<br> He's building<br> a suicide motive.<br> One moment, Leakin.<br> You told the jury that the Colonel<br> didn't usually take burgundy...<br> because it disagreed with him.<br> Did he dislike burgundy?<br> Oh no, my lord.<br> On the contrary.<br> - But seldom dared take it.<br> - Yes, my lord that is correct.<br> - Hawfield's killed that point.<br> - How? What do you mean?<br> By making it clear there's nothing<br> strange about his drinking burgundy.<br> I was anxious that the point<br> should be clear, Mr Keane.<br> Well, thank you, my lord.<br> I'm obliged to your lordship.<br> No questions, my lord.<br> Call Andre LaTour.<br> Andre LaTour.<br> Take the testament in your<br> right hand and repeat the oath.<br> "I swear by Almighty God...<br> that the evidence I shall give, shall<br> be the truth, the whole truth...<br> and nothing but the truth."<br> - Your name?<br> - Andre Etienne LaTour.<br> - Your age?<br> - Thirty.<br> You were born in Montreal, Canada and<br> you served in the war with Paradine?<br> Yes, sir. I was<br> his manservant before the war...<br> and later I had the honour<br> of serving under his command.<br> You won the Distinguished Conduct<br> Medal for gallantry in the field?<br> That is so, sir.<br> At the time of Paradine's death...<br> you were again employed as his valet<br> and confidential companion.<br> - Yes.<br> - Speak up, so that we can hear you.<br> You were very attatched to<br> Colonel Paradine, were you not?<br> He was the best man I ever knew<br> in all my life.<br> Very well then. At about 8 o'clock<br> you heard the bell ringing violently.<br> You went upstairs<br> to the Colonel's room.<br> You saw the Colonel and<br> Mrs Paradine facing each other.<br> What happened then?<br> He looked at me for a minute, in his<br> blind way and burst out with it.<br> Try to give us his exact words.<br> He said: "Do I understand<br> you're going to leave me?<br> Now, when I need you most?"<br> I asked him who had told him<br> such a thing.<br> He said:<br> "She did."<br> - Did he say anything else?<br> - He was very angry.<br> He used strong language.<br> - Did you intend to leave him?<br> - No, sir.<br> Do you know<br> why Mrs Paradine...<br> would tell her husband<br> you were leaving him?<br> She wanted to get rid of me.<br> You told us yesterday that when you<br> went back up to see the Colonel...<br> you saw Mrs Paradine in the hallway<br> outside the bedroom.<br> - You're certain of that?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Where's that plan?<br> I have here a plan of the house.<br> The upper floor.<br> Do you think she was passing directly<br> from Colonel's bedroom to her own?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> That will be all for<br> the time being.<br> LaTour lied about the quarrel.<br> He's keeping something back.<br> Does the name of Margaret Wells<br> convey anything to you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - And what does it convey to you?<br> I must try to help your memory.<br> I put it to you that some years ago<br> you were engaged...<br> to Margaret Wells<br> of Three Rivers, Quebec.<br> On your wedding day, she left you<br> at the church and went off...<br> - with a saddler named Richard Truman.<br> - That is finished! It's in the past.<br> Your question may be relevant,<br> Mr Keane: Its relevance escapes me.<br> My lord, the witness has shown<br> in his evidence and behaviour...<br> an almost pathological bias, against<br> not only my client, but all women.<br> I may be stupid, but I can't see what<br> this jilting has to do with the case.<br> After seeing the witness,<br> his appearance and bearing...<br> I'm inclined to regard the lady's<br> conduct as pathological, not his.<br> Silence.<br> Proceed to your next question.<br> Very good, my lord. If I'm<br> not allowed to show a reason...<br> for his hostile<br> attitude to my client.<br> Were you aware that Paradine made<br> a will bequeathing you 3500 pounds?<br> Come, come.<br> It's a simple question of fact.<br> Colonel Paradine told me he might<br> leave me a little something.<br> But I didn't<br> know about the will.<br> He told you he was going to leave you<br> this legacy, but you doubted his word?<br> - No, sir, I did not doubt his word.<br> - Then you believed it?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Then you knew and believed you would<br> receive such a legacy on his death.<br> - Please answer the question.<br> - I don't know what you ask.<br> You're being asked if you knew<br> you'd inherit...<br> We never discussed it.<br> I didn't think about it.<br> Yes, I knew.<br> You don't remember very<br> easily, do you, LaTour?<br> Now please think carefully<br> before you reply to this.<br> And remember<br> you are on your oath.<br> When you were in London,<br> did you or did you not...<br> repeatedly hear Colonel Paradine<br> say that he wished to be dead?<br> - That he wished he was dead, sir?<br> - That he wished to be dead.<br> Andre LaTour, do you deny<br> having heard Paradine say...<br> again and again, to you<br> and within your hearing...<br> that he was sick of life<br> and wished to be dead?<br> He said a lot of things when he<br> was angry about his blindness...<br> I got so accustomed to them<br> I didn't take much notice.<br> You didn't take much notice.<br> You did not take much notice.<br> Very well. Would you tell the court<br> exactly what happened about...<br> You mean you want me to<br> go over my evidence again?<br> No, LaTour. I don't want you<br> to go over your evidence again.<br> But did you not stand in that box<br> and swear by Almighty God...<br> that you'd tell the truth...<br> the whole truth and<br> nothing but the truth?<br> Very well, I put it to you that your<br> evidence was a tissue of lies.<br> You were trying to cover up<br> what really happened.<br> There's another person<br> in court who was there...<br> who knew what happened.<br> Remember that.<br> Mr Keane,<br> what is your question?<br> Do you still alledge that<br> Mrs Paradine invented a story...<br> about you leaving the Colonel<br> and this precipitated the quarrel?<br> - Yes, sir, she did.<br> - It would be her word against yours.<br> Yes, sir and so it was then<br> with the Colonel.<br> You're asking his lordship<br> and the jury to believe...<br> that after years of devoted service<br> in the field and the sick chamber...<br> that you were in this position?<br> That Paradine had absolutely<br> no faith in your word of honour?<br> I put it to you, LaTour, that<br> your story is a pack of lies.<br> - Do you persist in it?<br> - If she says the contrary, she'd...<br> What was that<br> you started to say?<br> Answer the question.<br> I stick to what I said.<br> If you don't mind, I'd like to<br> go over that night with you again.<br> In case any small incidents<br> have slipped your memory.<br> After the butler took<br> the Colonel his dinner...<br> - where were you?<br> - In my room.<br> Did he tell you about<br> the burgundy?<br> - Yes.<br> - Was that, or was that not unusual?<br> - Maybe so.<br> - Was it or wasn't it?<br> - It was.<br> - And after he'd told you this...<br> - then you went upstairs again?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why?<br> - I had no special reason, sir.<br> Shortly before, the Colonel<br> had denounced you...<br> for deserting him.<br> And yet you went upstairs<br> for no special reason?<br> I was unhappy about being<br> on bad terms with him.<br> What's that? Speak up,<br> the jury can't hear you.<br> I wanted to make it up<br> with the Colonel.<br> Very well. You knocked at the<br> Colonel's door and went in?<br> I knocked on his door.<br> I did not go in.<br> Very well, you knocked.<br> What happened then?<br> - The Colonel told me to go away.<br> - He told you to go away?<br> Without even knowing<br> who was knocking?<br> He asked who it was, I told him,<br> then he told me to go away.<br> You're very sharp, LaTour.<br> Tell me, what tone<br> did the Colonel use?<br> When he told you to go,<br> to get away from him.<br> My lord, when LaTour<br> gave his evidence...<br> his words were "The Colonel told me<br> to go away" not "get away from me".<br> Go away, get away from me,<br> what's the difference?<br> My learned friend can well appreciate<br> difference in shades of meaning...<br> and I'd prefer that he be<br> accurate in these matters.<br> It's a point of no importance.<br> Make it go away if you like.<br> Counsel is right in his contention,<br> you should be more careful.<br> If your lordship pleases, I'll<br> continue the cross examination.<br> LaTour, you used to help the<br> Colonel get to bed, did you not?<br> Quite a complicated matter<br> getting a blind man into bed.<br> Didn't everything<br> have to be ready?<br> Toothbrush, pyjamas,<br> hot-water bottle?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Yet you did not enter the room.<br> Not even to check that Leakin<br> had put the burgundy...<br> in the right place where the Colonel<br> wouldn't knock it over by mistake.<br> I wasn't thinking<br> about the burgundy.<br> Very well, you were wondering<br> how to make it up with the Colonel.<br> You were very much upset.<br> Is that putting it fairly?<br> Yes, I think so.<br> You stated that you saw<br> someone else in the hall.<br> - Yes, sir, Mrs Paradine.<br> - What was she doing?<br> Going to her bedroom.<br> Mrs Paradine's room was<br> across the hall...<br> - from the Colonel's room, correct?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> At the moment<br> you saw Mrs Paradine...<br> did you know where<br> she'd come from?<br> No, sir.<br> She might've come out of her room,<br> seen you and turned to go back again.<br> - It's possible.<br> - But...<br> she couldn't have come from the<br> Colonel's room without going around...<br> or through you.<br> Is that correct?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You saw Mrs Paradine<br> go into her room and shut the door.<br> - What did you do then?<br> - Nothing...<br> I hung about<br> for a minute or two...<br> - and then...<br> - What was your purpose...<br> in hanging about<br> for a minute or two?<br> I didn't have<br> any purpose. I just...<br> I just didn't know what to do.<br> Then I decided to go downstairs.<br> Tell me LaTour...<br> have you ever seen anyone<br> else die by poison?<br> No, sir.<br> Or any animal?<br> No, sir.<br> Wasn't there an old dog poisoned<br> at Hindley about 2 years ago?<br> Yes, sir, I beg your pardon.<br> I almost forgot.<br> Yes, so we noticed.<br> - It was killed by poison, wasn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> It was the Colonel's old<br> hunting dog. It was sick.<br> So we put him away.<br> You see...<br> You mean you put him away.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - What poison did you use?<br> - I don't know, sir.<br> - Don't know?<br> - Did you keep any of it?<br> - We got a single dose from the vet.<br> Don't keep saying we.<br> - You mean you did.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> It wasn't a big dose?<br> No sir, very small.<br> And it acted very quickly.<br> Yes it did.<br> I understand what you<br> mean to say.<br> He's accusing me of poisoning my<br> Colonel. But I didn't. I didn't.<br> I must ask the witness<br> to collect himself...<br> But it's not true, I tell you.<br> I didn't do it. How could I?<br> I must again<br> caution the witness...<br> to just answer the questions.<br> He is not on trial.<br> It is unneccesary for him...<br> to protest his innocence<br> concerning actions...<br> with which he has<br> not been charged.<br> And I think, Mr Keane, that this is a<br> convenient opportunity to adjourn.<br> We will resume at 5 past 2.<br> I swear by Almighty God...<br> that I shall keep this jury...<br> in a convenient place...<br> with such accomodation<br> as the court shall direct.<br> I will not suffer<br> any person to speak to them...<br> neither will I speak to them myself<br> touching this trial, except...<br> to ask if they are agreed<br> upon a verdict...<br> without leave of the court.<br> Tony.<br> Keane, Keane...<br> - Tony's torn him to pieces.<br> - It was horrible.<br> But darling, you've got to<br> remember it's Tony's job.<br> - It's gone well for us this morning.<br> - Has it?<br> - Surely you must know that.<br> - I'm not a lawyer.<br> Good heavens, you're a clever woman.<br> Don't you realise how I shook him?<br> You have not kept<br> faith with me.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I didn't agree to what you did today.<br> I objected when you wanted to say that<br> Andre helped my husband kill himself.<br> I objected even to that. And now you<br> make him out to be a murderer.<br> No, I will not forgive you<br> for what you have done today.<br> Forgive me?<br> I've exhausted myself...<br> destroying everything<br> to save you?<br> I did not ask you to do that.<br> Forgive me...<br> you forgive me.<br> When I was idiot enough to<br> fall in love with you.<br> Did you hear that?<br> If it's true, how could you deceive<br> me as you've done today?<br> Look...<br> the case has narrowed itself<br> down to this. One of three things.<br> Either your husband<br> poisoned himself...<br> or LaTour did it,<br> or you did.<br> As you like. But I will not have<br> you making Andre a murderer.<br> - Are you in love with him?<br> - What has that to do with it?<br> You're my lawyer<br> not my lover.<br> Someone else<br> said something...<br> very like that to<br> me recently.<br> I should like to know whether you<br> intend to continue with the case.<br> Yes, of course. I'm planning to cut<br> out all the witnesses except you.<br> I'm going to rely on your evidence<br> and my final speech to save you.<br> I know I can trust you.<br> I feel it.<br> - Yes, you can trust me.<br> - You will save me.<br> But not at his expense.<br> You understand that, don't you?<br> And suppose that's<br> the only way to save you?<br> You are not to destroy him.<br> If you do, I shall hate you as<br> I've never hated a man.<br> I must go on the way I've begun.<br> I must act according to my own view.<br> You can do what you like.<br> I've not finished with LaTour yet.<br> After that I'll put you<br> in the box.<br> Say what you like. My questions<br> will be mine and your answers yours.<br> Now, LaTour...<br> you remember your evidence?<br> During the quarrel, the Coronel<br> used strong language with you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Did he discharge you?<br> I didn't know what to think.<br> It was all a lie about my leaving.<br> Yes, yes, we've heard<br> about that.<br> - Did you assume you were discharged?<br> - Yes. I suppose so.<br> Aren't you aware that Mrs Paradine<br> is the mistress of Hindley Hall?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, let me review<br> things for you. You...<br> suppose you were discharged,<br> yet continue in the employ...<br> of a woman who allegedly lied<br> about you to your master?<br> Well, answer me, LaTour.<br> I felt I wanted to help take care<br> of the Colonel's estate.<br> - There was nowhere else to go, so...<br> - Yes, yes.<br> Do I understand, that after<br> the quarrel on May 6th...<br> you never again saw<br> Colonel Paradine alive?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - But you did see him dead?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - When?<br> - After Dr Young left, I was told...<br> - to clean up the room.<br> - Who gave you these instructions?<br> She did.<br> Whom do you mean by she?<br> Mrs Paradine.<br> While you were<br> cleaning the room...<br> did you notice the wine glass?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Did it still contain the burgundy?<br> Just a few drops in the<br> bottom of the glass.<br> Oh, there were a few drops left<br> in the bottom of the glass?<br> Yes, sir.<br> If you were told that Dr Young<br> had examined the glass...<br> after he discovered<br> Paradine was dead...<br> and found it to be clean.<br> That it had been washed and dried.<br> Would you still say there were a few<br> drops in the bottom of the glass?<br> Yes, sir,<br> I still say the same thing.<br> When did you wash<br> and dry that glass?<br> I never washed<br> or dried that glass.<br> I never touched it. I left it<br> just where it was.<br> You stated that Mrs Paradine<br> sent you to clean up the room.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - But after she sent you in...<br> - the glass was not yet washed.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Then it could not have been<br> Mrs Paradine who washed the glass.<br> Really, all this<br> is most improper.<br> Questions must<br> be kept within bounds.<br> Yes, I noticed Counsel<br> was tending to make points...<br> rather than ask questions.<br> But I was reluctant to interfere...<br> knowing how<br> he resents interruption.<br> LaTour, are you aware<br> of the penalty for perjury?<br> - Answer me.<br> - I've told the truth.<br> I put it to you that Paradine had a<br> reason for his rage that fatal night.<br> A reason that had nothing to do with<br> the story that you told in this court.<br> Was it at Hindley Hall or London that<br> you first gave Mrs Paradine reason...<br> - to complain of your attentions?<br> - It's not true, she never did.<br> And was she not forced<br> to go to her husband...<br> to beg him to dismiss<br> you from his service?<br> I won't stand here and listen<br> to these filthy lies.<br> And was that in fact the only<br> cause of the terrible scene...<br> which took place on<br> the night of Paradine's death?<br> No, you can't say that.<br> The Colonel knew, didn't he? Because<br> she told him. Isn't that the truth?<br> - Answer the question.<br> - I will not answer.<br> Why, because you won't admit<br> that you betrayed his trust?<br> No. She's told you lies<br> and I hate her.<br> - She told her husband about you?<br> - No she did not. He found out.<br> Then you mean he heard you<br> speaking improperly to his wife?<br> - Yes.<br> - I've finished with the witness.<br> I didn't want to tell about it.<br> I didn't want to hurt<br> his good name.<br> But you've spoken...<br> you and she.<br> Both of you.<br> So I too will speak.<br> I am finished with the witness.<br> Tony.<br> It was she who dragged<br> us both down.<br> I hated every moment with her...<br> but I couldn't help myself.<br> This man is a confessed perjuror.<br> Must the jury listen to this rubbish?<br> - Mr Keane.<br> - He's been forced to tell the truth...<br> and is now trying to involve<br> my client in his treachery.<br> Mr Keane,<br> this is not the first time...<br> you are responsible for such<br> an over-emotional atmosphere.<br> - I cannot blame the witness.<br> - With respect...<br> I submit that his evidence...<br> be sent to the Director<br> of Public Prosecutions...<br> with a view to the formulation<br> of charges of perjury...<br> which he certainly committed.<br> And whether to such a charge<br> might be added...<br> - one of murder.<br> - Mr Keane...<br> you seem anxious to use up<br> the duties of the judge in this case.<br> Proceed, Sir Joseph.<br> LaTour, in testifying as to what<br> was heard by Colonel Paradine...<br> are you implying you had an adulterous<br> relationship with Mrs Paradine?<br> Yes.<br> You know now what I did.<br> I can't live with<br> the memory of what I've done.<br> I'm afraid I must ask you to bear<br> with a few more questions.<br> Did you avoid the truth because of<br> your feelings about this woman?<br> Yes, I lied.<br> Because I didn't want the world<br> to know what she was.<br> She was my Colonel's wife.<br> And also because<br> you care for her?<br> I don't know how to say it.<br> I tried not to but...<br> That's all.<br> My lord that concludes<br> the case for the prosecution.<br> Members of the jury...<br> the woman who is before you<br> in the dock is a foreigner.<br> Friendless and alone<br> in a strange country.<br> But a country that has always prided<br> itself on its passion for justice.<br> I had intended to call before you<br> numerous witnesses on her behalf.<br> To speak of her character...<br> of her self-sacrifice.<br> A sacrifice made by a beautiful<br> woman while still fascinating...<br> and still young, in order to bring<br> the light of affection...<br> into the darkness of<br> a blinded man's life.<br> But after hearing the case<br> for the Crown...<br> we have decided to call<br> no witnesses...<br> except the prisoner.<br> He hasn't lost his nerve.<br> I'll say that for him.<br> When she's been heard, I'm confident<br> the jury will decide not guilty.<br> I'll now ask the prisoner<br> to go into the box.<br> Absolutely certain<br> that when she leaves...<br> there'll be nothing left of<br> the stain which the prosecution...<br> has so wrecklessly<br> and unjustifiedly...<br> sought to place<br> upon her character.<br> I call the prisoner,<br> Madelena Paradine.<br> Hold the Testament in your right<br> hand and repeat the oath.<br> I swear by Almighty God, the evidence<br> I shall give shall be the truth...<br> the whole truth and<br> nothing but the truth.<br> If you wish, you may be seated<br> while giving your evidence.<br> No thank you, my lord.<br> - What is your name?<br> - Madelena Ana Paradine.<br> - The widow of Richard Paradine?<br> - I am.<br> What were your circumstances<br> when you married him?<br> I was very poor. My life had been<br> unpleasant and...<br> unattractive.<br> - Joyful, isn't she?<br> - Very clever of Tony.<br> He's just<br> disarming the other side.<br> Had you no fear at the thought of<br> spending your life with a blind man?<br> - I thought it a splendid opportunity.<br> - Opportunity?<br> Yes, I thought...<br> I would be his eyes.<br> Did you find it difficult to care<br> for a blind man?<br> To take care of him.<br> - No.<br> - He was never unkind to you?<br> Sometimes.<br> But I understood.<br> It was terrible for him being like<br> that. It was easy to forgive him.<br> On the night of<br> your husband's death...<br> a quarrel took place<br> at your London home?<br> Yes.<br> Will you tell the jury, please,<br> the cause of that quarrel?<br> I'd spoken to my husband<br> about his valet LaTour.<br> I asked my husband to find<br> another place for him.<br> Why was that?<br> Answer the question.<br> I did not wish LaTour<br> to stay in the house.<br> Why didn't you wish LaTour<br> to stay in the house?<br> I preferred<br> he shouldn't be there.<br> - But why?<br> - I did not like his manner with me.<br> What did you dislike?<br> I thought it sometimes<br> too familiar.<br> Could you explain exactly<br> what you mean by that?<br> He took liberties.<br> Did he try<br> to make love to you?<br> Please answer.<br> Did he try<br> to make love to you?<br> Yes.<br> And you complained<br> to your husband?<br> I did.<br> Now, Mrs Paradine...<br> you've heard LaTour's version<br> of the quarrel on May 6th.<br> What actually did happen<br> when he came into the room?<br> My husband swore at him<br> and said...<br> - "You have insulted my wife."<br> - And what did LaTour say?<br> He broke down and said...<br> that if my husband would forgive him<br> it would never happen again.<br> Then LaTour's version<br> is completely untrue?<br> My lord, I object.<br> My learned friend is putting words...<br> - into the mouth of a witness.<br> - I was merely asking a question.<br> The form was objectionable.<br> I'm anxious not to intervene again.<br> Am I being clear?<br> Your lordship always makes his<br> meanings perfectly clear.<br> Then kindly attend<br> to my ruling...<br> and do not let me<br> have to repeat it.<br> I'll always note the ruling of a<br> learned judge...<br> however much I may<br> disagree with it.<br> Don't bandy words with me,<br> Mr Keane.<br> Kindly go on with your<br> examination of the witness.<br> Mrs Paradine...<br> after your husband's death<br> you sent in LaTour to tidy up?<br> Was anyone with you when<br> you sent LaTour into the room?<br> Dr Young.<br> Was Dr Young still with you when<br> LaTour came out of the room?<br> Yes.<br> Have you heard Dr Young's statement<br> that after he left you...<br> he found the glass<br> washed and dried?<br> I've heard that, yes.<br> Is it not true that the only person<br> who could've washed it is LaTour?<br> - My lord, I...<br> - All right, all right...<br> Could anyone else have<br> washed and dried it?<br> I know what you're trying<br> to make me say.<br> You want to make people think...<br> that Andre LaTour<br> killed my husband.<br> Silence.<br> I asked you whether anyone else<br> could have washed the glass.<br> Yes.<br> What do you mean by yes?<br> I did.<br> I warn you that you've made<br> a very serious admission.<br> Would you like to make some<br> explanation of it to the jury?<br> My lord, with<br> the utmost respect, I...<br> would like to request that I be given<br> time to consider this turn of events.<br> This piece of evidence is<br> entirely new to me.<br> Mr Keane, it's getting late and<br> we've had a very trying session.<br> Would it be convenient to you<br> if we adjourned now?<br> I would be greatly obliged<br> to your lordship.<br> We will adjourn until tomorrow<br> morning at 10.30.<br> - Aren't you staying to dinner Judy?<br> - No, I promised Father.<br> Goodnight, dear.<br> - Hello Tony.<br> - Hello.<br> What the devil are you looking<br> so sad about?<br> Nothing.<br> I was there today.<br> - Was Gay with you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Was that your idea?<br> - Yes.<br> I suppose you'll have your usual<br> expert comment to make on the case.<br> - Yes.<br> - That will most certainly be helpful.<br> Precisely what I need<br> at this moment.<br> - If she washed the wine glass...<br> - She didn't.<br> - I hope the jury agrees with you.<br> - She's covering for that dirty swine.<br> If she did wash the glass...<br> it's because she knew he killed him.<br> I could make her say so tonight.<br> Tony, you won't get angry if I ask<br> you something else, will you?<br> Will it make any difference<br> if I do?<br> Why do you keep on<br> about the quarrel?<br> That's what made her say<br> what she did.<br> If you really want to know,<br> if your father wants to know...<br> it's because I want to get<br> at the motive.<br> LaTour's motive.<br> He was in love with her.<br> He wanted to get rid<br> of her husband.<br> What about your motive?<br> What do you mean?<br> I know, and you know<br> and Gay knows...<br> why you think<br> LaTour's the murderer.<br> You wouldn't have handled it<br> that way otherwise.<br> You treated her as if you were<br> cross examining for the prosecution.<br> Tony it's true.<br> Someone had to say.<br> You've got to save this woman<br> for Gay's sake.<br> If you'll leave me alone,<br> perhaps I still can.<br> If you're left to your own devices,<br> I'll bet you one thing:<br> Mrs Paradine and your career will be<br> done for. If it weren't for Gay...<br> I wouldn't be sure that'd be<br> a bad thing either.<br> Goodnight.<br> My lord I've finished<br> with the witness.<br> - That's funny.<br> - What do you mean?<br> I'll tell you later.<br> Mrs Paradine, did you think<br> Andre LaTour very handsome?<br> Of course not. He is a servant. How<br> could I consider him in that way?<br> These attentions from LaTour<br> had gone on for some time?<br> Yes.<br> Why did you wait until that night<br> to tell your husband?<br> - I was ashamed.<br> - Why should you be ashamed?<br> - It wasn't your fault.<br> - Of course not.<br> Then why be ashamed?<br> Was it your modesty that held you<br> back? Remembering your past?<br> I protest at the insinuation.<br> There's been no evidence<br> about her past.<br> My lord, there was<br> no insinuation.<br> I merely tried to convey<br> that a lady of her...<br> to use her own words,<br> unattractive past, didn't need...<br> to avoid appealing to her husband<br> because of maidenly modesty.<br> I must ask you, Mr Keane,<br> not to interrupt counsel.<br> I will intervene if I see reason.<br> Proceed.<br> I ask you on your oath,<br> Mrs Paradine...<br> did you not complain about LaTour<br> because you were in love with him?<br> In love with him?<br> Yet I asked my husband<br> to send him away?<br> - Is that what you think?<br> - Did you not finally succeed...<br> in inducing this man,<br> who worshipped his master...<br> to betray him?<br> I deny that.<br> Now, Mrs Paradine<br> is it not true...<br> that when you realised<br> LaTour took no interest in women...<br> you resolved to overcome<br> that indifference?<br> No.<br> Weren't you in love with LaTour all<br> the time you lived at Hindley Hall?<br> No.<br> Weren't you madly in love with him<br> all the time you lived in London?<br> What you say is not true.<br> Is anything wrong,<br> Sir Joseph?<br> I'd like an opportunity to consider<br> what bearing this has on the case.<br> I've been informed that the witness<br> LaTour has done away with himself.<br> Andre.<br> - That does it.<br> - Oh, Tony.<br> My lord,<br> I submit that this...<br> has great bearing on the case. It's<br> obvious why he committed suicide.<br> - It bears out my...<br> - I don't think so.<br> The witness said he couldn't live,<br> knowing he'd betrayed his master.<br> I suggest both counsel<br> recover their equanimity...<br> and remember where they are.<br> The jury will disregard...<br> all they've just heard.<br> None of it was evidence.<br> Mr Keane, do you want an adjournment<br> to consider your position?<br> No, my lord...<br> on further consideration...<br> I've no application.<br> I will, however...<br> have my observations<br> to make to the jury in due course.<br> Yes, yes. Sir Joseph,<br> does the prosecution...<br> want an adjournment?<br> No, my lord.<br> I regret the court has been subjected<br> to this additional sensationalism.<br> Then proceed, Sir Joseph.<br> Mrs Paradine...<br> you admitted yesterday that you...<br> deliberately washed the glass that<br> contained what killed your husband.<br> Why did you wash that glass?<br> Answer my question.<br> Why did you wash that glass?<br> You must answer the question.<br> I'm sorry, I didn't hear.<br> Counsel has repeated<br> the question once.<br> What does it matter now?<br> Andre's dead.<br> The man I love is dead.<br> I thought about it day and night.<br> But I didn't know how.<br> I wanted to do it so<br> we could be free.<br> So Andre and I could go away...<br> and live together as we should.<br> But Andre wouldn't help me.<br> He and his honour.<br> I must warn you of the gravity<br> of the statement you are making.<br> Andre knew<br> I killed the blind man.<br> Andre knew it.<br> I didn't tell him,<br> but he knew it.<br> I think it quite unnecessary to ask<br> any further questions, my lord.<br> Is there anything else you wish<br> to ask the witness, Mr Keane?<br> - Mrs Paradine...<br> - I have nothing to say to you.<br> I loved Andre LaTour...<br> and you murdered him.<br> My life is finished.<br> It is you who has finished it.<br> My only comfort is the hatred<br> and contempt I feel for you.<br> My lord...<br> members of the jury...<br> I've done my best.<br> This case...<br> has already...<br> taken a heavy toll...<br> in the life of LaTour...<br> in it's burden on you...<br> and indeed on me.<br> I am, more than ever,<br> conscious of my shortcomings.<br> Everything I've done...<br> seems to have gone<br> against my client.<br> But, members of the jury...<br> you must not confuse my...<br> incompetence...<br> with any of the issues<br> of this trial.<br> Those are two questions apart.<br> Two questions...<br> quite apart.<br> Many things have become<br> obscured in this trial.<br> Many things...<br> have become obscured.<br> My lord, I can go on no longer.<br> I request your indulgence...<br> to let my friend...<br> Mr Cullens,<br> take over this case.<br> It's surprising how closely<br> a walnut...<br> resembles the human brain.<br> I wish you hadn't refused...<br> forbidden me to... you were right...<br> to go to the trial today.<br> Your coughing, might've distracted<br> me. It was important that I...<br> concentrate on Mr Keane's<br> performance.<br> Of course.<br> How I shall pray the verdict'll<br> be not guilty.<br> Must I listen to more<br> of your silly pity...<br> for every scoundrel,<br> man or woman...<br> I do pity her.<br> Who needs pity more than<br> a woman who's sinned?<br> You always forget that punishment<br> is part of the scheme.<br> - A necessary part of it.<br> - Doesn't life punish us enough?<br> Doesn't it? Why should we<br> hurt each other?<br> We've no right to be cruel. If I'm<br> certain of anything, it's of that.<br> You've knocked over a glass.<br> Oh, so I have.<br> Give it to me.<br> You've been talking more<br> nonsense than usual tonight.<br> I'm afraid this trial<br> has got on your nerves.<br> - I suggest you go to bed.<br> - Yes, I will, Tommy.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, that poor woman.<br> Couldn't you do something<br> for her?<br> How dare you speak to one of<br> His Majesty's judges like that?<br> The jury decides questions<br> of guilt or innocence.<br> I may be silly, Tommy, but<br> I love you. I've always loved you.<br> And you must have known how<br> terrible it is to love a man who...<br> Tommy, when you were young<br> you were kind.<br> - You can't sit on that bench...<br> - As long as I sit on that bench...<br> I'll continue to do my duty.<br> And I performed a duty today.<br> The Paradine woman will be hanged<br> after three clear Sundays.<br> Next time, you'll place your<br> confidence with more discretion.<br> I suppose I ought to get out of here.<br> I've kept you up late enough.<br> You're more than welcome.<br> But I wish you'd telephone Gay.<br> She must be worried.<br> - Worried to death.<br> - Worried I'll come home, you mean.<br> The least I can do is spare Gay<br> the boring job of standing by me.<br> Listen to me. You're not as wise<br> about everything as you think.<br> You mustn't despair. If there's one<br> thing I can't abide it's despairing.<br> What would you have me do?<br> Hope for a high court judgeship?<br> Well, not for a while.<br> But all this talk of giving up<br> the bar is poppy-cock.<br> If I know anything about Gay,<br> there's nothing she wants now but...<br> Father.<br> Where is she?<br> Hello, Tony.<br> Hello.<br> What about some breakfast?<br> Do you mind? Thanks...<br> but as a matter of fact<br> I was just leaving.<br> Tony, you really shouldn't have<br> worried me like this.<br> I waited up till all hours.<br> I should've known<br> you'd be here with Simmie.<br> I was proud of you today.<br> Yes, I was.<br> Darling, it won't be easy.<br> There'll be those<br> who laugh at you, sneer.<br> And I don't think the newspapers<br> will be very kind.<br> The worst thing of all<br> was what I did to you.<br> Tony, the most important<br> moment in your life...<br> wasn't when you discovered<br> what she was.<br> And it wasn't when you'd the courage<br> to stand before the whole world...<br> and confess your own mistakes.<br> The most important moment...<br> Look at me Tony.<br> The most important moment<br> in your life is now.<br> My husband is the most brilliant<br> man I've ever known.<br> You can throw away your career and<br> become a beachcomber if you want.<br> Maybe that's not<br> such a bad idea.<br> Darling...<br> don't you understand? I want you<br> back on the job as fast as you can.<br> And I hope you've a tough case.<br> Very tough.<br> So that... it will take<br> the very best you have.<br> Winning every verdict<br> you're after. Convincing...<br> There you go again darling...<br> with all your fancy ideas<br> about me.<br> Incidentally darling,<br> you do need a shave.<br>
