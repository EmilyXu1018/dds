The North Star.<br> See?<br> You start from the front two stars<br> of the Big Dipper.<br> And then you count up.<br> You count up five finger lengths...<br> ...and it's right there.<br> And she'll always be<br> looking down on us.<br> And protect us.

Good night, Meg.<br> It helps her to know Mother's there.<br> Good night.<br> So what was in the maiI?<br> Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.<br> He's 17, a year younger than I.<br> Well, the assembly's been convened,<br> so I've been called to Charles Town.<br> - We're going to Charles Town?<br> - We are.<br> We leave in the morning.<br> Aunt Charlotte!<br> Margaret, William, look at you.<br> Missed you.<br> They're huge.<br> What have you been feeding them?<br> Well, they're from good stock.<br> On their mother's side, of course.<br> Thank you. Come inside.<br> Wait untiI you see what I have.<br> - Presents?

Easy.<br> I envy you...<br> ...your youth and distance from this<br> cruel conflict of which I am a part.<br> " But I am fortunate to be<br> serving the cause of Liberty.<br> And though I fear death...<br> ...each day in prayer I reaffirm<br> my willingness...<br> ...to give my life in its service.<br> Pray for me.<br> But above all, pray for the cause.<br> Your loving brother, GabrieI."<br> What are you doing?<br> Turn around.<br> Not yet, Thomas.<br> When?<br> Seventeen.<br> That's two years.<br> It's already been two.<br> - The war could be over by then.<br> - God willing.<br> All right.

Were you there?<br> Have you seen any Redcoats?<br> No, not yet.<br> Abigale, the children, please.<br> Children, come. Upstairs.<br> Gates marched us straight<br> at the Redcoats.<br> Our lines broke. The British<br> Green Dragoons cut us to bits.<br> I was given these dispatches.<br> As I left, I saw<br> the Virginia Regulars surrender.<br> The Dragoons rode into them.<br> Killed them all.<br> Over 200 men.<br> I have to get these dispatches<br> to Hillsborough.<br> You can't ride.<br> I can't stay here!<br> It's not safe for-<br> Fire!<br> Fire!<br> Thank you for the care<br> of His Majesty's soldiers.<br> Have a detachment take our<br> wounded to our surgeons at Winnsboro.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Fire the house and barns.<br> Let it be known if you harbor<br> the enemy you will lose your home.<br> By order of King George...<br> ...all slaves of the American colonies<br> who fight for the Crown...<br> ...will be granted their freedom<br> with our victory.<br> We're not slaves.

I will do so<br> as soon as possible.<br> Thank you.<br> Now we come to the matter<br> of the specific targeting...<br> ...of officers during engagements.<br> You must know that in civilized<br> warfare, officers in the field...<br> ...must not be accorded inappropriate<br> levels of hostile attention.<br> To your mind, what are appropriate<br> levels of hostile attention?<br> Imagine the chaos that would follow...<br> ...from leaderless armies<br> having at each other.<br> There must be gentlemen in command<br> to lead...<br> ...and, where necessary,<br> restrain their men.<br> Restrain them from, say, targeting<br> civilians. Women, children and such.<br> That's a separate issue.<br> No. I consider them linked.<br> And as long as your soldiers<br> attack civilians...<br> ...I will order the shooting<br> of officers at every engagement.<br> And my men are excellent marksmen.<br> Very well.<br> - Now, let us move on to-<br> - Prisoner exchange.<br> Sir?<br> You have 18 of my men.<br> I want them back.<br> I do have 18 criminals<br> under sentence of death...<br> ...but I hold no prisoners of war.<br> If that's your position,<br> Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.<br> My officers?<br> Sir.<br> Top of the ridge, to your left.<br> Below the tree line.<br> Their names and ranks?<br> They refused to give names.

I recognize him.<br> He's the commander of the militia.<br> Your ghost.<br> Stay that sword, coloneI!<br> He rode in under a white flag<br> for formaI parley.<br> This is madness.<br> If you harm him,<br> you condemn our officers.<br> With respect, sir, he's killed as many<br> officers in the last two months.<br> He has shown no aggression here.<br> Hence he cannot be touched.<br> Has he not?<br> You!<br> So you're the ghost, are you?<br> I remember you!<br> On that farm! That stupid little boy!<br> Did he die?<br> You know...<br> ...it's an ugly business,<br> doing one's duty.<br> But just occasionally...<br> ...it's a reaI pleasure.<br> Before this war is over,<br> I'm going to kill you.<br> Why wait?<br> Soon.<br> Move out!<br> But I still think it's imperative<br> to push north.<br> One of our captured officers, my lord.<br> My reputation suffers<br> because of your incompetence!<br> That man insults me!<br> Quite impressive for a farmer with<br> a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?<br> I want you to find that man.<br> I want you to capture him.<br> The man has the loyalty of the people.<br> They protect him.

A plantation seven miles<br> from Wakefield, on the Santee...<br> ...east of Black Swamp.<br> Who lived there?<br> Benjamin Martin.<br> He's the ghost.<br> What do you know about him?<br> Hell, everything.<br> I could tell you the size of his boot.<br> Does he have family?<br> Where would he hide his children?<br> His wife's sister has a plantation.<br> It's not far.<br> Aunt Charlotte!<br> Wake up, someone's coming!<br> Get the boys.<br> Margaret, come quickly.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Boys, come.<br> Go.<br> Stay close.<br> This way.<br> Follow me.<br> We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.<br> Margaret, quick!<br> Get down there!

I hate him.<br> Susan, you don't hate him.<br> I hate him, and I hope<br> he never comes back.<br> It's the children.<br> Abigale!<br> You're alive!<br> She spoke. Susan talked to you?<br> In full sentences.<br> As if she'd been speaking all along.<br> Damn, I wasn't there for it.<br> What did she say?<br> She said...<br> ...that she loves you<br> and misses you...<br> ...but understands<br> why you can't be with her.<br> My Lord, she said that.<br> Isn't that something?<br> Tavington has a list of our men.<br> He's burning our homes...<br> ...killing whomever resists.<br> Where?<br> Seven homes along the Santee so far.<br> John, this is not a time<br> for vengeance.<br> This is a time for mourning.<br> Attend to your families.<br> One week furlough for all men.<br> Any man who does not return will not<br> be thought a coward or uncommitted.<br> Father!<br> Papa!<br> They're huge.<br> What have you been feeding them?<br> They're from good stock<br> on their father's side.<br> Susan?<br> I see it.
