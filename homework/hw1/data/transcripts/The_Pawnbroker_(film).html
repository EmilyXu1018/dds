Fine.<br> Teaching time, Mr. Nazerman.<br> Time to teach.<br> Now, last time you<br> taught me gold, right?<br> What are you going<br> to teach me tonight?<br> Tonight I teach you<br> to save your pennies.<br> I'm going to do that, Mr. Nazerman.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Now, in the meantime,<br> I'm learning business<br> from a master, right?<br> So I got to know one thing,<br> Something I've been<br> thinking about.<br> How come you people come<br> to business so naturally?<br> "You people"?<br> Oh, I see. Yeah.<br> I see. I see.<br> You, uh...<br> You want to learn the secret<br> Of our success.<br> Is that right?<br> All right.<br> I'll teach you.<br> First of all, you start off<br> With a period of<br> several thousand years<br> During which you have<br> nothing to sustain you<br> But a great bearded legend.<br> You have no land to call your own,<br> To grow food on or to hunt.<br> You have nothing.<br> You're never in one<br> place long enough<br> To have a geography<br> or army or land myth.<br> All you have is a little brain.<br> A little brain and a<br> great bearded legend<br> To sustain you and convince you<br> That you are...<br> Special...<br> even in poverty.<br> But this, uh...<br> This little brain...<br> That's the real key, you see.<br> With this little brain<br> You go out and buy<br> a piece of cloth.<br> Cut that cloth in two.<br> Sell it for a penny more<br> than you paid for it.<br> Buy another cloth.<br> Cut it into 3 pieces.<br> Sell it for 3 pennies profit.<br> But during that time<br> you must never succumb<br> To buying an extra piece<br> of bread for the table<br> Or a toy for a child.<br> No!<br> No, you must immediately run out<br> And get yourself a still<br> larger piece of cloth.<br> So you repeat this<br> process over and over,<br> And suddenly you<br> discover something.<br> You have no longer any desire,<br> Any temptation to dig into<br> the earth to grow food<br> Or gaze at limitless land<br> and call it your own.<br> No, no. You just go on and on,<br> Repeating this process<br> over the centuries.<br> And suddenly you make<br> a grand discovery.<br> You have a mercantile heritage.<br> You are a merchant.<br> You're known as a usurer,<br> A man with secret resources,<br> A witch, a pawnbroker,<br> A sheeny, a mockie, and a kike!<br> You're really some<br> teacher, Mr. Nazerman.<br> You're really...<br> Really the greatest.<br> Jesus?<br> Yeah?<br> Como va tu trabajo?<br> Va bien, mama.<br> Muy bien.<br> Si?<br> Si.<br> Te gusta tu jefe?<br> Quien, Nazerman?<br> Si.<br> Uh-huh.<br> Sabe muchas cosas.<br> Si?<br> Estoy apprendiendo<br> muchas cosas por el.<br> Ay, que bueno.<br> Algun dia voy a tener<br> mi propio negocio.<br> Ay, que bueno.<br> Uno no va salir del<br> tapo careo apartamento.<br> Entonces quiere decir que<br> de ahora en adelante<br> Vas hacer buen muchacho.<br> Of course.<br> I am a very good boy.<br> I am a good boy.<br> Un buen muchacho.<br> Ok, good boy.<br> Say good boy.<br> Pero...<br> Good boy.<br> No es lo mismo que decir goodbye?<br> No, es otra cosa.<br> Ven aqu. Ven aqu.<br> Good boy.<br> Say good boy.<br> Good.<br> Good...<br> Boy.<br> Right. I am...<br> I am...<br> A good-I am.<br> I am. I am...<br> I am...<br> A good...<br> A good boy.<br> Nazerman...<br> I can't even look at him anymore.<br> I start to blush.<br> Nazerman of leipzig.<br> Look, Tessie...<br> Don't be an hysterical woman.<br> Neither one of us<br> has done anything<br> That we should feel guilty about.<br> You'd better go and see him.<br> I was in Auschwitz, too.<br> I came out alive.<br> You came out dead.<br> I'll have some coffee for<br> you when you come out.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> Guilt.<br> And there it is.<br> Guilt to find yourself alive.<br> And so you wrap yourself<br> In a kind of shroud<br> And feel you share<br> the dignity of death<br> With those who really died.<br> Tell me...<br> Does blood ever flow<br> through you, Sol Nazerman?<br> Can you feel pain?<br> No.<br> You are a fake.<br> You breathe, you eat, you walk.<br> You make money.<br> You take a dream and<br> give a dollar...<br> And give no hope.<br> I survive.<br> Survive?<br> A coward's survival,<br> and at what a price!<br> No love. No passion.<br> No pity! Dead!<br> Sol Nazerman, the walking dead!<br> It's wednesday.<br> Yeah, so it's wednesday.<br> We were to have lunch together.<br> In fact, you set the day yourself.<br> Had you forgotten?<br> Yes, I'm afraid I had.<br> Well, it-it doesn't matter.<br> Here I am.<br> Miss Birchfield, I feel I<br> must be honest with you.<br> I do not wish to inflict<br> a failure on you,<br> But I do not welcome<br> your interest.<br> You were in a concentration camp,<br> Weren't you?<br> That's no concern of yours.<br> Would you like to hear<br> a little about me?<br> It really doesn't matter.<br> No, I don't believe you<br> when you say that.<br> When I was a little girl,<br> I was fat and amiable,<br> and everyone liked me.<br> The boys used to think<br> I was a great sport.<br> I remember some of them<br> even told me solemnly<br> That I reminded them<br> of their sisters.<br> Well, in that odd category,<br> I went to lots of parties<br> And I had loads of friends<br> And there was nothing wrong.<br> Until one day I discovered<br> that I'd acquired...<br> A most excruciating malady...<br> Loneliness.<br> One day there was a young man.<br> We fell in love.<br> We got married.<br> He died. Like that.<br> His heart just stopped.<br> And I found out that loneliness<br> Is the normal state of affairs.<br> For most people.<br> My dear miss Birchfield,<br> How touchingly naive you are.<br> Oh! You have<br> discovered loneliness!<br> You have found out that the<br> world is unjust and cruel.<br> Let me tell you something,<br> my dear sociologist...<br> That there is a world<br> different than yours,<br> Much different, and the people<br> in it are of another species.<br> Now, I ask you a question.<br> What do you know?<br> I guess I'm out of my depth.<br> Oh, I would say so.<br> But what happened to me...<br> Is nothing.<br> No!<br> That's not so.<br> What makes you so bitter?<br> Bitter?<br> Oh, no, miss Birchfield,<br> I am not bitter.<br> No, that passed me by<br> a million years ago.<br> I'm a man of no anger.<br> I've no desire for vengeance<br> For what was done to me.<br> I have escaped from the emotions.<br> I am safe within myself.<br> All I ask and want<br> is peace and quiet.<br> Why haven't you found it?<br> Because people like<br> you will not let me!<br> Miss birchfield, you<br> have made the afternoon<br> Very tedious with<br> your constant search<br> For an answer.<br> And one more thing.<br> Please...<br> stay out of my life.<br> You shouldn't have done that.<br> What's the matter, uncle?<br> Don't you like wednesdays?<br> You shouldn't have touched it.<br> Well, it's done.<br> The boss wants you to sign these.<br> There'll be no papers signed today.<br> Look, maybe you don't understand.<br> I understand you perfectly.<br> I said no papers signed today. Leave<br> them, but no papers get signed.<br> The boss ain't going...<br> I said no papers get signed today!<br> Ok.<br> You're a tough man, Mr. Nazerman.<br> I mean, he looks tough, but...<br> Why don't you mind<br> your own business?<br> You know...<br> You worry me when you look<br> like that, Mr. Nazerman.<br> What-what is wrong with you?<br> Hmm?<br> I don't know.<br> Good afternoon, Mr. Nazerman.<br> Mr. Nazerman, for some days now<br> I've been trying to give an idea<br> Some sort of shape, a-a pattern.<br> Now-now, Mr.- Mr...<br> Socrates...<br> Socrates himself<br> Was on the very borderline<br> of drama, right?<br> Right, and look at Baudelaire.<br> Baudelaire and all his<br> strange, sacred mysticism.<br> And who knows?<br> Perhaps the marquis de...<br> Exactly what was it<br> That you came to pawn, Mr. Smith?<br> Pawn?

Rejects.<br> You're a mighty hard<br> man, Mr. Nazerman.<br> I mean, after all,<br> They are children of god.<br> Ain't they?<br> You believe in god, Ortiz?<br> I don't know, Mr. Nazerman.<br> But you believe in god,<br> And I make book on that.<br> I do not believe in god<br> Or art or science<br> Or newspapers or<br> politics or philosophy.<br> Well, then, Mr. Teacher...<br> Ain't there nothing you do believe?<br> Money.<br> All right.<br> Then you teach me<br> About money then, Mr. Nazerman.<br> All right, Mr. Ortiz.<br> Now, come here.<br> Firstly, money can increase<br> or decrease in value.<br> Secondly, money is risky,<br> but at a given moment,<br> One has some idea of its worth.<br> Thirdly, money can<br> buy you many things...<br> Comfort, luxury, relief from pain,<br> Sometimes even life itself,<br> And now you listen to me,<br> And you listen very carefully.<br> Next to the speed of<br> light, which einstein says<br> Is the only absolute<br> in the universe,<br> Second only to that, I rank money!<br> Well...<br> You believe me, that's<br> all you need to know.<br> That's what life's all about?<br> That's what life is all about.<br> You mean, money is the whole thing?<br> Money is the whole thing.<br> I'll see you later, Mr. Nazerman.<br> Please, please?<br> Please, please, listen to me.<br> Honey, I can get you the money.<br> I got some gifts I could sell.<br> Extras from the customers.<br> You know.<br> Baby, you don't need them others...<br> Tangee and buck,<br> most that Robinson...<br> They just poison.<br> Baby, nothing they do<br> for you won't hurt you.<br> Oh, please, please, let me chip in.<br> I can get it for you.<br> I know I can.<br> Money.
