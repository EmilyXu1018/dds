I mean,<br> Miss Tracy or her mother in?<br> They may be at the swimming pool, sir.<br> Shall I announce you?<br> No. I'll go around myself<br> and surprise them.<br> It will indeed<br> be a surprise, sir.<br> These are friends of Mr. Junius's.<br> Have them wait in the south parlor.<br> Certainly, Mr. Haven.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> The south parlor?<br> Miss lmbrie, the south parlor.<br> The queen will have bread and honey<br> at the usual time.<br> Seems a little cold<br> for the south parlor.<br> I'd rather expected to find<br> pickaninnies and banjos.<br> What's this room?<br> I forgot my compass.<br> This would be south-southwest<br> parlor by living room.<br> Knickknacks, gimcracks,<br> signed photographs.<br> You'd have to be as rich as the Lords<br> to live in a dump like this.<br> - I wouldn't live in it if they paid me.<br> - They won't.<br> Looks like they run<br> a hockshop on the side.<br> Just lookin' around.<br> I'll want your fingerprints for this.<br> Hey, what's this...<br> What's this guy Haven up to?<br> C.K. Dexter Haven.<br> What kind of a name is that?<br> C.K. Dexter Haven.<br> Macaulay Connor's<br> no homespun tag, my pet.<br> Yeah, you just try<br> callin' me Macaulay.<br> I knew a plain Joe Smith once.<br> He was only a clerk in a hardware store,<br> but he was an absolute rat.<br> C.K. Dexter Haven.<br> He plays polo, he designs<br> sailboats, "class" boats.<br> - Very upper class.<br> - Don't despair.<br> He's out. Kittredge,<br> man of the people, is in.<br> Quite a comer too, I understand.<br> Political timber.<br> Poor guy. I wonder<br> how he fell for it.<br> Uh-oh, Liz. What did I tell you?<br> How do you like this?<br> "Living room, sitting room,<br> terrace, pool, stables."<br> That's so they can talk to the horses<br> without having them in the house.<br> Don't, Mike!<br> Yes?<br> This is the bridal suite.<br> Send up some caviar sandwiches<br> and a bottle of beer.<br> What? Who is this?<br> This is the voice of doom calling.<br> Your days are numbered,<br> to the seventh son of the seventh son!<br> - Hello? Hello?<br> - What's the matter?<br> One of the servants<br> has been at the sherry again.<br> - Dexter, you've come back!<br> - Ah, Dinah, my dream girl!<br> What in the name of...<br> No, it can't be. He went to<br> South America for two years.<br> Edward said they were<br> at the swimming pool.<br> They seem to be here.<br> Dexter, don't you know<br> that tomorrow is the wedding?<br> Oh, that's right.<br> So it is.<br> You can go right back<br> where you came from!<br> Can't. Dinah says it's<br> awful here without me.<br> Hello, you sweet thing.<br> Red, you look in the pink.<br> You don't think I'd miss<br> your wedding, do you?<br> - Dexter, you wouldn't.<br> - I'm not so sure he wouldn't.<br> No, Mother Lord, I wouldn't.<br> I assure you I wouldn't.<br> - Tell us all about Junius.<br> - Stay 'til lunch.<br> Don't open your house. Stay here.<br> We're having no guests over the wedding.<br> - How about the groom?<br> - He's staying at the gatehouse.<br> Oh, that's good.<br> - Junius is fine.<br> - He should be here.<br> He's heartbroken. I suggested<br> representing him as best man...<br> I'm afraid that George might prefer<br> to have his best man sober.<br> I wish you'd represent George.<br> That's my loyal little girl.<br> You'll like the people Junius did send.<br> You haven't switched from liquor<br> to dope, by any chance?<br> - You see?<br> - The people Junius did send?<br> You don't know a Macaulay Connor<br> or Elizabeth lmbrie, do you?<br> - We can finish these later.<br> - I'd better introduce you.<br> Call me for...<br> Introduce me to whom?<br> To Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor,<br> to tell them which rooms they'd have.<br> Mr. Connor is asking if he should wear<br> a black or white tie to tonight's party.<br> - Rooms?<br> - I'd better start from the beginning.<br> Sit down, dear.<br> They're great friends of Junius's.<br> And they expect to stay here?<br> I think that's very queer.<br> I think it's queerer than that.<br> I think it's paranoiac.<br> You see, it was Junius's idea.<br> They've been very kind to him, and...<br> You're lying, Dexter.<br> I can always tell.<br> - Can you, Red?<br> - They're Junius's friends.<br> You went to work after<br> the divorce, didn't you?<br> Yes, except for a brief interlude<br> in some alcoholic sanitariums.<br> You took a job<br> in South America. Who for?<br> - A magazine.<br> - It wasn't Spy magazine?<br> You are a mass of intuition.<br> I don't suppose that Junius's<br> friends are photographers?<br> - I thought you were low, but I never...<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - After I've telephoned Junius...<br> - Wait, Red.<br> Don't telephone Junius.<br> I'll confess.<br> No. You're slipping, Red.<br> I used to be afraid of that look,<br> the withering glance of the goddess.<br> I didn't think that alcohol would...<br> Oh, shut up.<br> Dinah, stay here.<br> Please, Mother.<br> Maybe he's going to sock her.<br> Don't say "sock," darling.<br> "Strike" is quite an ugly enough word.<br> Who do they think they are,<br> barging in on peaceful people?<br> - They'll think you don't want them.<br> - I want them out, and you too!<br> Yes, your majesty. But first could I<br> interest you in some small blackmail?<br> It's an article, complete with<br> snapshots, details and insinuations...<br> and it's ready for<br> publication in Spy...<br> and it's about your father<br> and that dancer in New York.<br> About Father and Tina Mara?<br> Quiet. Dinah.<br> But they can't,<br> even if it's true.<br> - Where do you get these?<br> - From Sidney Kidd, editor and publisher.<br> - He's got to be stopped.<br> - He is, temporarily.<br> That is, if you'll allow those two<br> to turn in the story on your wedding.<br> And when Kidd says a story,<br> he means a story.<br> - I'm gonna be sick.<br> - Yes, dear.<br> "An Intimate Day<br> With a Society Bride."<br> I am sick.<br> It's tough, but that's<br> the way it seems to be.<br> So I'm to be examined, undressed<br> and generally humiliated...<br> at 15 cents a copy.<br> And you, you...<br> You're loving it.<br> Am I, Red?<br> Mother, we're hooked.<br> - Are they really reporters?<br> - Not even friends of Junius's?<br> They aren't anybody's friends,<br> but we're to pretend they are.<br> - But why?<br> - Don't ask me.<br> There's a good reason,<br> and it's my wedding, so please!<br> I'll bet it's on account<br> of Father and that dancer.<br> - Dinah, what do you know?<br> - I listen around.<br> Is there no such thing<br> as privacy anymore?<br> Only in bed, Mother,<br> and not always there.<br> Watching every little mannerism...<br> jotting down notes on how we sit,<br> stand, talk, eat and move!<br> - Will they do that?<br> - All in that horrible, snide English.<br> If we have to submit to it<br> to save Father's face...<br> which, incidentally,<br> doesn't deserve it...<br> I'll give them a picture of home life<br> that'll stand their hair on end!<br> Tracy, we must just be ourselves,<br> very much ourselves.<br> But you want us to create<br> a good impression, don't you?<br> They don't know that we know<br> what they're here for?<br> No. That was understood.<br> The girl's quite nice.<br> He writes short stories.<br> Very down to earth.<br> - They'll love us.<br> - Oh, dear, you'd both better dress.<br> And both of you, promise to behave<br> like ladies in front of these creatures.<br> We'll do our best, Mrs. Lord.<br> I don't know how good that is.<br> Dexter, how perfectly dreadful.<br> What'll they say about Seth not being<br> here for his own daughter's wedding?<br> I know, dear.<br> You'd better go and tell them how<br> terribly happy we are to have them.<br> That's the old Quaker spirit,<br> Mother Lord.<br> Keep swinging.<br> Oh. I thought it was that butler.<br> The family will be down<br> to welcome you.<br> - What with?<br> - With open arms.<br> They're terribly happy to have<br> any friends of Junius's here.<br> - Do they know about us?<br> - Why should they?<br> Look, Haven, our research department<br> didn't give us much data.<br> This fianc of this girl,<br> George Kittredge, age 32?<br> - You know him very well?<br> - Well enough.<br> "General manager of Quaker State Coal,<br> company owned by Seth Lord."<br> - That's the girl's father, huh?<br> - What a coincidence.<br> How'd he meet her?<br> Heaven brought them together,<br> I imagine.<br> "Seth Lord.<br> "See Banker's Annual,<br> Directory of Directors."<br> - Is there a library in town?<br> - Yes.<br> I suppose you wouldn't<br> know where that is?<br> Well, roughly.<br> My grandfather built it.<br> Now, about this girl...<br> "Tracy Samantha Lord."<br> What about her?<br> Well, what's her<br> leading characteristic?<br> She has a horror of men<br> who wear their hats in the house.<br> Leading characteristics<br> to be filled in later.<br> I can fill them in right now.<br> The young, rich, rapacious<br> American female.<br> No other country<br> where she exists.<br> And would I change places<br> with Tracy Samantha Lord...<br> for all her wealth and beauty?<br> Oh, boy, just ask me.<br> Well, tell four footmen to call me<br> in time for lunch, will you?<br> How do you do?<br> Friends of my brother Junius,<br> are you not?<br> I am Dinah Lord.<br> My real name is Diana,<br> but my sister changed it.<br> I'm Elizabeth lmbrie.<br> This is Macaulay Connor.<br> Enchante de vous voir!<br> Enchante de faire votre connaissance!<br> I spoke French<br> before I spoke English.<br> My early childhood was spent in Paris<br> where my father worked in a bank:<br> - The House of Morgan.<br> - Really?<br> C'est vrai absolument!<br> Can you play the piano?<br> I can, and sing at the same time!<br> Listen.<br> Lydia, oh, Lydia<br> Say, have you met Lydia<br> Oh, Lydia<br> the tattooed lady<br> She has eyes<br> that folks adore so<br> And a torso even more so<br> What is this?<br> Idiot, probably.<br> The queen of tattoos<br> On her back<br> is the battle of Waterloo<br> Beside it the wreck<br> of the Hesperus too<br> And proudly above<br> waves the red, white<br> And blue<br> You can learn a lot from Lydia<br> Ah, petite soeur,<br> tu es un vritable petit Chopin!<br> - Tu trouves?<br> - Mais certainement.<br> Mais qu'est-ce qu'il y a?<br> Voyons, tu es ple.<br> Montre-moi ta langue. J'espere bien<br> que ce n'est pas le smallpox.<br> - Le smallpox?<br> - Mais oui.<br> Va dire a maman de se dpecher!<br> Oh. How do you do?<br> I'm Tracy Lord.<br> It's so nice having you here.<br> How did you leave Junius?<br> We left Junius fine.<br> That little sister of yours...<br> Isn't she a dear?<br> So talented.<br> - Junius is such a lamb, isn't he?<br> - Yes, isn't he?<br> It's a pity none of the male members<br> of the family are going to be here.<br> - Where's your father?<br> - Darling Papa.<br> - I do hope you'll stay for my wedding.<br> - We'd like to very much.<br> - That was our idea.<br> - I'm so glad that it occurred to you.<br> The house is in rather<br> a mess, of course.<br> We'll all have to huddle here<br> and overflow onto the porch.<br> - I hope your rooms are comfortable.<br> - Your father sick?<br> - What a cunning little camera.<br> - I'm an awful nuisance with it.<br> But you couldn't be.<br> I hope you'll take loads.<br> Dear Papa and Mama aren't<br> allowing any reporters in.<br> That is, except for little Mr. Grace,<br> who does the social news.<br> Can you imagine a grown-up man<br> having to sink so low?<br> It does seem kind of bad.<br> You're a kind of writer...<br> - aren't you, Mr. Connor?<br> - Sort of.<br> - A book?<br> - Yes.<br> Under what name do you publish?<br> My own. Macaulay Connor.<br> What's the Macaulay for?<br> Well, my father<br> taught English history.<br> I'm "Mike" to my friends.<br> Of whom you have many, I'm sure.<br> English history,<br> it's always fascinated me:<br> Cromwell, Robin Hood,<br> Jack the Ripper.<br> Where did he teach?<br> I mean, your father.<br> In a little high school<br> in South Bend, Indiana.<br> South Bend.<br> It sounds like dancing,<br> doesn't it?<br> You must have had a most<br> happy childhood there.<br> - Yeah, it was terrific.<br> - I'm so glad.<br> - I didn't mean it that way.<br> - I'm so sorry. Why?<br> Well, lack of wherewithal,<br> I guess.<br> But that doesn't always cause<br> unhappiness, does it?<br> Not if you're<br> the right kind of man.<br> George Kittredge, my fianc,<br> never had anything either, and he...<br> Are either of you married?<br> You mean you were,<br> but now you're divorced.<br> - The fact is...<br> - Surely you're not ashamed of it.<br> - Of course I'm not.<br> - What?<br> It was years ago.<br> I was only a kid in Duluth.<br> Good heavens, Liz.<br> You never told me.<br> - You never asked me.<br> - I know, but you...<br> Joe Smith, hardware.<br> You're the darnedest girl, Liz.<br> I think I'm sweet.<br> Duluth must be a lovely spot.<br> It's west of here, isn't it?<br> Sort of, but occasionally<br> we get the breezes...<br> And this is your first visit<br> in Philadelphia.<br> It's a quaint old place,<br> don't you think? Filled with relics.<br> And how old are you, Mr. Connor?<br> Thirty.<br> One book isn't much<br> for a man of 30.<br> I don't mean to criticize.<br> You probably have other interests<br> outside your work.<br> None.<br> I mean us.<br> How sweet.<br> Are you going together?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - That is an odd question.<br> I don't see why.<br> I think it's very interesting.<br> Miss lmbrie, don't you agree...<br> that if a man says he loves a girl,<br> he ought to marry her?<br> Can she be human?<br> Please, Mr. Connor.<br> I asked Miss lmbrie a question.<br> Well, that depends. L...<br> I'll see what's keeping Mama.<br> Who's doing the interviewing here?<br> - You don't suppose she caught on?<br> - No, she was born that way.<br> - Don't let her throw ya.<br> - Do you want to take over?<br> - I wanna go home.<br> - Ah, here you are.<br> How do you do?<br> We're so happy to have you.<br> Forgive me for not coming in sooner,<br> but things are in such a state.<br> My little girl.<br> She's going to leave me.<br> Aren't you pretty, my dear.<br> But then Junius's friends always are.<br> Look at the way<br> she wears her hair, Tracy.<br> - Isn't it pretty?<br> - Mighty fine.<br> Shall we have sherry on the porch?<br> - This is my youngest daughter, Diana.<br> - I think we've met.<br> I wish my husband could be here.<br> We expect him presently.<br> He's detained in New York on business<br> for that lovely dancer, Tina Mara.<br> - Do you know her work?<br> - Not professionally.<br> So talented,<br> and such a lovely person...<br> but like so many artists,<br> no business head.<br> None whatever.<br> I have some lovely presents,<br> don't you think so, Mr. Connor?<br> Hello, everybody.<br> - I hope I'm not late.<br> - You're never late, George.<br> We have a lovely surprise. Junius has<br> sent these people as a wedding present.<br> Mr. Kittredge,<br> this is Miss... I'm so sorry.<br> - Imbrie.<br> - Any friend of Junius's is my friend.<br> And, uh, Mr. Morrow?<br> - I didn't get the name.<br> - Connor.<br> Macauley Connor.<br> He's a writer.<br> Don't apologize, Mrs. Lord.<br> No apology necessary.<br> I have great respect for writers.<br> Well, thank you.<br> Any kind word is...<br> - How are you?<br> - Much better now that you're here.<br> Oh, I guess this<br> must be love, huh?<br> - Your guess is correct.<br> - I'm just his faithful old dog Tray.<br> - Give me your paw.<br> - You've got it.<br> How sweet.<br> Say, I'd like to see<br> one of those, Miss lmbrie.<br> You will.<br> Shall we have some sherry?<br> I suppose Junius has told you<br> all about our happy little family.<br> - Papa!<br> - What?<br> Dear Papa.<br> You angel to get here<br> in time for lunch!<br> - Isn't he, Mama?<br> - Indeed he is, but...<br> Father, these are our friends,<br> Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor.<br> - How are you, Mr. Lord?<br> - Oh, just fine, thank you.<br> - How are you?<br> - How do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> Howdy, Pops.<br> Oh, dear Dinah.<br> - Father, here's George.<br> - How are you, Kittredge?<br> Margaret, my sweet.<br> - Another place for luncheon, Edward.<br> - Very good, madam.<br> Well... here I am...<br> in the bosom of my...<br> - Hello, friends and enemies.<br> - Young man!<br> - Remove yourself.<br> - How are you, sir?<br> I don't know. Get along.<br> Darling, I've changed my mind.<br> I will stay for lunch.<br> Another place, Edward.<br> - Hello, Kittredge.<br> - How are you, Haven?<br> Just Damon and Pythias.<br> No, Grant and Lee.<br> You don't look as well as when<br> I last saw you, Kittredge.<br> Oh, you poor fellow.<br> I know just how you feel.<br> - How's it coming?<br> - Beautifully, Dexter.<br> We're so indebted to you<br> for these lovely people.<br> It's almost impossible<br> to repay that debt.<br> But you'll manage, eh, Red?<br> - They grew up together, you know.<br> - How nice.<br> You don't look old enough<br> to get married...<br> not even the first time,<br> but then you never did.<br> She needs trouble to mature her,<br> Kittredge. Give her lots of it.<br> I'm afraid she can't<br> count on me for that.<br> No? That's too bad.<br> For your own sake, Red,<br> you should have stuck to me longer.<br> I thought it was for life, but the nice<br> judge gave me a full pardon.<br> Ah, that's the old redhead.<br> No bitterness, no recrimination.<br> Just a good swift left to the jaw.<br> They grew up together.<br> Luncheon is served, madam.<br> Oh, thank you, Edward. Come sit.<br> We have so much to talk about.<br> I don't suppose a man ever had<br> a better or finer family.<br> I often wake up in the night<br> and say to myself...<br> "Seth, you lucky dog,<br> what have you done to deserve it all?"<br> And what have you?<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Oh, how stupid of me!<br> Oh, dear! How awful!<br> I had a feeling<br> that would happen.<br> Your camera.<br> I'm so, so sorry.<br> I'm sure you are.<br> What is it?<br> Your father.<br> Uncle Willie!<br> - Uncle Willie, how nice.<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> Please go on into lunch, everyone.<br> I want a word with Uncle Willie.<br> - Another place, Edward.<br> - Yes, madam.<br> I'm afraid I don't understand.<br> You never have, but you<br> came anyway, didn't you?<br> Oh. Still Justice with her<br> shining sword, eh, daughter?<br> - Who's on the spot?<br> - We are, thanks to you...<br> Uncle Willie.<br> How long will you be researching?<br> Not long if I can find the right books...<br> his family history and stuff like that.<br> There's a cousin Joanna<br> that's definitely crazy.<br> - Who told you?<br> - Dinah.<br> - Dinah should know.<br> - Come across the street when you finish.<br> - Miss Hobson's establishment.<br> - Okay.<br> What does thee wish?<br> I'm looking for some local b...<br> - What'd you say?<br> - What does thee wish?<br> Um, local biography or history.<br> If thee will, consult with<br> my colleague in there.<br> Dost thou have a washroom?<br> Thank thee.<br> I know this is a public library,<br> but I wou...<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Couldn't you afford<br> to buy my book?<br> The bookstore didn't have one.<br> Are you sure you're doing<br> the right thing?<br> You know what happens to girls like you<br> when they read books like mine.<br> They begin to think.<br> That's bad.<br> These stories are beautiful.<br> Why, Connor,<br> they're almost poetry.<br> Don't kid yourself. They are.<br> I can't make you out at all now.<br> Really?<br> I thought I was easy.<br> So did I, but you're not.<br> You talk so big and tough,<br> and then you write like this.<br> Which is which?<br> Both, I guess.<br> No, I believe you put the toughness on<br> to save your skin.<br> You think so?<br> I know a little about that.<br> - Do you?<br> - Quite a lot.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> This book was just such<br> a complete surprise to me.<br> L... let's walk, shall we?<br> Lt'll be much more fun.<br> Take this. Tell Mr. Kittredge<br> we'll meet him at the pool.<br> Yes, Miss Tracy.<br> The story called, "With The Rich<br> and Mighty," I think I liked it best.<br> I got it from<br> a Spanish peasant's proverb.<br> "With the rich and mighty,<br> always a little patience."<br> I like that.<br> What's the matter?<br> A little too rough?<br> A little...<br> but I'm used to it.<br> Tell me something, will you?<br> When you can do a thing like that book,<br> how can you possibly do anything else?<br> You may not believe this, but there<br> are people that must earn their living.<br> Of course, but people<br> buy books, don't they?<br> Not as long as there's<br> a library around.<br> That book of mine represents<br> two solid years' work...<br> and it netted Connor<br> something under $600.<br> - But that shouldn't be.<br> - Unhappily it is.<br> This is beautiful country around here.<br> What is it all, anyway?<br> Part of our place.<br> What about your Miss lmbrie?<br> Well, Miss lmbrie's<br> in somewhat the same fix.<br> She's a born painter and might be<br> a very important one...<br> but Miss lmbrie must eat, and she also<br> prefers a roof over her head...<br> to being constantly out<br> in the rain and snow.<br> Food and a roof.<br> You've really got something here.<br> - Where?<br> - All this.<br> Oh. Come on.<br> The dressing rooms are over here.<br> I think you'll find<br> everything you need.<br> Use any old one, but I think you'll find<br> most of the junk in there.<br> - Yell if you need anything.<br> - Okay.<br> I have an idea.<br> I have the most wonderful<br> little house in Uniondale.<br> It's up on a hill with a view<br> that would knock you silly.<br> I'm never there except<br> in the hunting season...<br> and not much then,<br> and I'd be so happy to know...<br> that it was of some real use<br> to someone.<br> - Can you hear me?<br> - Yeah.<br> There's a brook and a small lake...<br> no size, really...<br> and a patch of woods,<br> and in any kind of weather...<br> it's the most wonderful...<br> Well, anyhow, I'm so delighted<br> that I can offer it to you.<br> Well, it's terribly nice of you,<br> but, uh...<br> Heck, that's Dexter.<br> Look, if he comes here,<br> stand by, will you?<br> - I don't want to be alone with him.<br> - Certainly, if you like.<br> Isn't it lucky that I happened<br> to think about that house?<br> And don't think I'd come trooping in<br> every minute, because I wouldn't.<br> I'd never come<br> except when expressly asked to.<br> - Well, it isn't that.<br> - What is it?<br> Well, you see,<br> the idea of artists...<br> depending upon a patron lady bountiful<br> has more or less gone out.<br> Oh. I see.<br> That wasn't especially kind<br> of you, Mr. Connor.<br> I'm sorry to have seemed patronizing.<br> - Now, look, I didn't mean...<br> - Please don't bother.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello. Fancy seeing you here.<br> Orange juice? Certainly.<br> Don't tell me you've forsaken<br> your beloved whiskey and whiskeys.<br> No, I've just changed their color.<br> I'm going for the pale pastel shades.<br> They're more becoming to me.<br> How about you, Mr. Connor?<br> You drink, don't you?<br> - Alcohol, I mean.<br> - A little.<br> A little?<br> And you're a writer?<br> Tsk, tsk, tsk. I thought all writers<br> drank to excess and beat their wives.<br> You know, at one time I think<br> I secretly wanted to be a writer.<br> Dexter, would you mind<br> doing something for me?<br> - Anything. What?<br> - Get the heck out of here.<br> I couldn't do that.<br> That wouldn't be fair to you.<br> You need me too much.<br> Would you tell me what<br> you're hanging around for?<br> - No, please don't go, Mr. Connor.<br> - No, please don't go, Mr. Connor.<br> As a writer, this ought to be<br> right up your street.<br> Don't miss a word.<br> I never saw you looking better, Red.<br> You're getting that fine, tawny look.<br> Oh, we're going to talk<br> about me, are we? Goody.<br> It's astonishing what money can do<br> for people, don't you agree, Mr. Connor?<br> Not too much, you know.<br> Just more than enough.<br> Take Tracy, for example.<br> There was never a blow that<br> hasn't been softened for her.<br> Never a blow that won't be softened.<br> It's even changed her shape.<br> - She was once a dumpy little thing.<br> - I'm not interested in myself now.<br> Not interested in yourself?<br> You're fascinated, Red.<br> You're far and away<br> your favorite person in the world.<br> - In case you don't know...<br> - Of course, Mr. Connor...<br> she's a girl<br> who's generous to a fault.<br> To a fault, Mr. Connor.<br> Except to other people's faults.<br> For instance, she never had<br> any understanding...<br> of my deep and gorgeous thirst.<br> - That was your problem.<br> - Granted.<br> But you took on that problem<br> with me when you took me, Red.<br> You were no helpmate there.<br> You were a scold.<br> It was disgusting.<br> It made you so unattractive.<br> A weakness, sure, and strength<br> is her religion, Mr. Connor.<br> She finds human imperfection<br> unforgivable.<br> When I discovered that<br> my relationship to her...<br> was supposed to be not that of a loving<br> husband and a good companion but...<br> - Oh, never mind.<br> - Say it.<br> But that of a kind of high priest<br> to a virgin goddess.<br> Then my drinks grew deeper<br> and more frequent.<br> I never considered you as that<br> nor myself.<br> You did it without knowing it.<br> And the night that you got drunk on<br> champagne and climbed out on the roof...<br> and stood there, naked,<br> with your arms out to the moon...<br> wailing like a banshee.<br> I never had the slightest recollection<br> of doing any such thing.<br> You drew a blank.<br> You wanted to.<br> Mr. Connor, what would you... oh.<br> A nice story for Spy,<br> incidentally.<br> Yes. Too bad we can't supply<br> photographs of you on the roof.<br> Honestly, the fuss you made<br> over that silly, childish epis...<br> It was enormously important<br> and most revealing.<br> The moon is also a goddess,<br> chaste and virginal.<br> Stop using those foul words.<br> What are you trying<br> to make me out as?<br> - What do you fancy yourself as?<br> - I don't know that I fancy myself...<br> When I read you're gonna marry<br> Kittredge I couldn't believe it.<br> That's why I'm here.<br> How could he even think of it?<br> Because he's everything you're not.<br> He's been poor, he's had to work,<br> and he's had to fight for everything...<br> and I love him as I never<br> even began to love you.<br> Maybe so, but I doubt it.<br> It's just a swing from me...<br> but it's too violent a swing.<br> Kittredge is no great<br> tower of strength.<br> He's just a tower.<br> You hardly know him.<br> To hardly know him<br> is to know him well.<br> Perhaps it offends my vanity to have<br> anyone who was even remotely my wife...<br> remarry so obviously beneath her.<br> How dare you, in this day and age,<br> use such an idiotic...<br> I'm talking about the difference<br> in mind and spirit.<br> You could marry Mac,<br> the night watchman. I'd cheer for you.<br> - Kittredge is not for you.<br> - You bet he's for me.<br> He's a great man and a good man.<br> Already he's<br> of national importance.<br> You sound like Spy magazine talking.<br> But whatever he is, toots,<br> you'll have to stick.<br> - He'll give you no out as I did.<br> - I won't require one.<br> I suppose you'd still be attractive<br> to any man of spirit, though.<br> There's something engaging about it,<br> this "goddess" business...<br> something more challenging to the male<br> than the more obvious charms.<br> - Really?<br> - Really.<br> We're very vain, you know.<br> "This citadel can and shall be taken,<br> and I'm the boy to do it."<br> You seem quite contemptuous of me<br> all of a sudden.<br> No, Red, not of you.<br> Never of you.<br> Red, you could be the finest woman<br> on this earth.<br> I'm contemptuous of something inside you<br> you either can't help or won't try to.<br> Your so-called "strength"...<br> your prejudice against weakness,<br> your blank intolerance.<br> - Is that all?<br> - That's the gist of it.<br> Because you'll never be a first-class<br> human being or a first-class woman...<br> until you've learned to have<br> regard for human frailty.<br> It's a pity your own foot<br> can't slip a little sometime...<br> but your sense of inner divinity<br> wouldn't allow that.<br> This goddess must<br> and shall remain intact.<br> There are more of you<br> than people realize.<br> A special class of the American female.<br> "The Married Maidens."<br> So help me,<br> if you say another word...<br> I'm through, Red.<br> For the moment I've had my say.<br> I suppose I should object<br> to this twosome.<br> That would be most objectionable.<br> Any time either of you<br> want my advice...<br> - We'll give you a ring.<br> - Thanks. Do that, will you?<br> So long, Red.<br> I left you a wedding present. Sorry I<br> hadn't ribbon to tie it up with.<br> Aren't you swimming?<br> We haven't time.<br> Uncle Willie wants us at 8:00.<br> Look what your friend<br> considers a wedding present.<br> - Why, it's a model of the True Love.<br> - The what?<br> A boat he designed<br> and built, practically.<br> We sailed it down the coast of Maine<br> and back the summer we were married.<br> My, she was yare!<br> "Yare"? What's that mean?<br> It means, uh...<br> Oh, what does it mean?<br> Easy to handle, quick to the helm.<br> Fast, bright.<br> Everything a boat should be...<br> until she develops dry rot.<br> Oh, George, to get away.<br> Somehow to be useful<br> in the world.<br> Useful? You, Tracy?<br> I'm gonna build you an ivory tower<br> with my own two hands.<br> Like fun you are.<br> You mean you've<br> been in one too long?<br> Well, I mean that<br> and a lot of things.<br> You know, we're gonna<br> represent something, Tracy...<br> you and I and our home.<br> Something straight, sound and fine.<br> Then perhaps Mr. Haven will be<br> somewhat less condescending.<br> You don't really mind him, do you?<br> I mean the fact of him?<br> "Fact of him"?<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean...<br> Well, you know.<br> That he ever was<br> my lord and master.<br> That we ever were...<br> I don't believe<br> he ever was, Tracy.<br> Not really.<br> I don't believe that anyone ever was<br> or ever will be.<br> That's the wonderful thing<br> about you, Tracy.<br> What? How?<br> You're like some marvelous, distant,<br> well, queen, I guess.<br> You're so cool and fine<br> and always so much your own.<br> There's a kind of beautiful purity<br> about you, Tracy, like a statue.<br> - George...<br> - It's grand, Tracy.<br> It's what everybody<br> feels about you.<br> It's what I first<br> worshipped you for from afar.<br> - George, listen.<br> - First, now and always.<br> Only from a little nearer now,<br> eh, darling?<br> L... I don't want to be worshipped.<br> I want to be loved.<br> Well, you're that too, Tracy.<br> You're that, all right.<br> I mean really loved.<br> But that goes<br> without saying, Tracy.<br> No. No, now it's you<br> who doesn't see what I mean.<br> I'd better get dressed.<br> I hate to be late.<br> Oh, nothing. Run along.<br> I'll be dressed when you get back.<br> You're Uncle Willie's guest of honor.<br> You mustn't be late.<br> That fianc of yours roared<br> out of here on two wheels.<br> Does he, by any chance,<br> ever walk anywhere?<br> When he likes, I expect.<br> I have a feeling he'll take that ring<br> tomorrow and go through center with it.<br> Seth, you idiot!<br> Very amusing, I'm sure.<br> Almost as amusing as the sight of you<br> with your arm around Mother.<br> I find very unamusing...<br> the stupid, undignified spectacle<br> we're making of ourselves...<br> for the benefit<br> of those two newspaper people.<br> Whose fault is it?<br> That's not the point. They can publish<br> anything they like about me...<br> but I insist that we inform Connor<br> and the camera lady...<br> that we're all aware<br> of their purpose here.<br> All right.<br> I'll tell them myself.<br> It'd look better coming from me<br> as the titular head of the family.<br> Of course, inasmuch as you've<br> let us in for it in the first place!<br> Keep that note out of your voice.<br> It's very unattractive.<br> Oh? How does your dancer friend talk,<br> or does she purr?<br> - Tracy!<br> - It's quite all right.<br> Sweet and low, I suppose.<br> Dulcet. Very ladylike.<br> You've got nerve to come back here in<br> your best head-of-the-family manner...<br> and make stands and strike attitudes<br> and criticize my fianc...<br> and give orders<br> and mess things up generally.<br> - Stop it instantly!<br> - I can't help it! It's sickening!<br> - As if he'd done nothing at all.<br> - Which happens to be the truth.<br> Anyway, it's not your affair.<br> If it concerns anyone...<br> Well, actually, I don't know<br> who it concerns except your father.<br> That's very wise of you, Margaret.<br> What most wives fail to realize is that<br> their husbands' philandering...<br> has nothing whatever<br> to do with them.<br> Oh? Then what has it to do with?<br> A reluctance to grow old, I think.<br> I suppose the best mainstay a man<br> can have as he gets along in years...<br> is a daughter.<br> The right kind of daughter.<br> How sweet.<br> No, I'm talking seriously about<br> something I've thought over thoroughly.<br> I've had to.<br> A devoted young girl<br> gives a man the illusion...<br> that youth is still his.<br> - Very important, I suppose.<br> - Oh, very, very.<br> Because, without her, he might be<br> inclined to go in search of his youth.<br> That's just as important to him<br> as it is to any woman.<br> But with a girl of his own,<br> full of warmth for him...<br> full of foolish, unquestioning,<br> uncritical affection...<br> - None of which I've got.<br> - None.<br> You have a good mind,<br> a pretty face...<br> a disciplined body that does<br> what you tell it.<br> You have everything it takes to make<br> a lovely woman except the one essential.<br> An understanding heart.<br> Without that, you might as well<br> be made of bronze.<br> That's an awful thing<br> to say to anyone.<br> Yes, it is indeed.<br> So I'm to blame<br> for Tina Mara, am I?<br> - To a certain extent, I expect you are.<br> - You coward!<br> But better that than a prig<br> or a perennial spinster...<br> however many marriages.<br> - Seth, that's too much.<br> - I'm afraid it's not enough.<br> I'm afraid nothing is.<br> - What did you say I was?<br> - Do you want me to repeat it?<br> A prig and a...<br> You mean you think I think I'm some kind<br> of a goddess or something?<br> If your ego<br> wants it that way, yes.<br> Also, you've been talking<br> like a jealous woman.<br> What's the matter with everyone<br> all at once, anyhow?<br> I've been asleep.<br> What time is it?<br> - After 7:00.<br> - Call my house.<br> Tell them I'm on my way.<br> You'd better come along too.<br> You're the host tonight,<br> you know? Uncle Willie.<br> That's all over.<br> You're yourself again. So am I.<br> - You've told them?<br> - I shall at the first opportunity.<br> My first party, and about time.<br> - Can I have a cocktail?<br> - Certainly not!<br> - It's a dirty gyp.<br> - That dress hikes up a little behind.<br> - No, it's me that does.<br> - You look adorable, Dinah.<br> Oh, thanks, Tracy.<br> Thanks ever so much.<br> Tracy, you must dress.<br> Let's all have a last drink.<br> I'm sorry. I forgot. You never drink.<br> - Prigs don't.<br> - What's that?<br> - Nor spinsters.<br> - Again, please?<br> Nor goddesses of any variety.<br> Not completely.<br> Just a borderline case.<br> Miss lmbrie and I<br> have something on our minds.<br> Splendid.<br> Just the place for it. What?<br> - We'd like to say something.<br> - I'm all ears and eyes.<br> You're a vision of loveliness,<br> Miss lmbrie.<br> Will you have a cocktail<br> or champagne?<br> Oh, champagne.<br> I've never had enough.<br> You will, tonight.<br> - I'd like to say...<br> - I have something to say first.<br> - I am Seth Lord.<br> - No!<br> - Then that makes you...<br> - Available.<br> And you are Miss lmbrie<br> of Spy magazine.<br> - Now you know.<br> - I was going to tell you...<br> - As to the reasons...<br> - Not now. We ought to be early.<br> And who'll go with me<br> in my little car?<br> Dinah and I. Seth, will you take<br> Miss lmbrie and Mr. O'Connor? Dinah?<br> I can tell there's something in the air,<br> because I'm being taken away.<br> Well, I'll see you all later.<br> Don't do that.<br> What's the matter?<br> Nothing.<br> Miss lmbrie?<br> You know, I felt exactly<br> as though I'd been pinched.<br> Don't you think you weren't.<br> You aren't even dressed.<br> Um, you go ahead.<br> I'll, uh,<br> follow along with George.<br> What's the matter with Tracy?<br> You tell me, will you?<br> Darned if I know.<br> I'd like to.<br> Well, Macaulay,<br> if you ever happen to find out...<br> I'll tell you. Sure.<br> And remember, Mike:<br> - "With the rich and mighty"...<br> - "Always a little patience"?<br> Do you know what time it is?<br> It's after 4:00.<br> In China it's later than that.<br> In China we'd be married by now.<br> Or perhaps it's only yesterday.<br> I'm going home after this dance.<br> There was a Chinese poet<br> who was drowned...<br> while trying to kiss<br> the moon in the river.<br> - He was drunk.<br> - I'd say as much.<br> But he wrote beautiful poetry.<br> Macaulay Connor of South Bend<br> reporting for duty.<br> I'm sorry, we're going home<br> after this dance.<br> You can't do that to me,<br> not a friend of old Junius.<br> - I mean, not an old friend of Junius.<br> - I wish old Junius were here.<br> Tracy, I'll get your wraps.<br> He'll wrap me up.<br> - Hello, you.<br> - Hello.<br> - You look fine.<br> - I feel fine.<br> Good, good.<br> Oh, wait a minute.<br> What was I saying?<br> Oh. Let's have another drink,<br> or would Kittredge spank?<br> - That's not what you were saying.<br> - It isn't? All right.<br> Not what I was saying.<br> Oh, oh, I know.<br> Why do you wish your brother was here?<br> Does he like Kittredge?<br> - Everybody likes Kittredge.<br> - Everybody likes Kittredge.<br> Everybody except<br> C.K. Dexter Haven, huh?<br> - Come on. We'll have some wine.<br> - Some wine.<br> Mother, I thought you'd<br> gone home ages ago.<br> I should have, but I've been<br> having such a good time.<br> - Everybody should have a good time.<br> - Darling, what's come over you?<br> Oh, it's just that<br> a lot of things...<br> I always thought were<br> terribly important...<br> I find now are...<br> and the other way around and...<br> Oh, what the dickens.<br> Connor, you're thirsty,<br> and the night is young.<br> - Here we are, dear.<br> - We're going to have one more drink...<br> - Not you, I'm afraid.<br> - Why should you be afraid?<br> - You know wine never affects me.<br> - Look here...<br> What she really wants, George,<br> is another dance with you.<br> - Oh, very well.<br> - Lf it's that much of a chore...<br> - Not for me!<br> - You've already been too attentive!<br> George, please.<br> What will the neighbors think?<br> - The course of true love.<br> - Gathers no moss.<br> Boy, champagne.<br> Just the bottle.<br> I'm going on a picnic.<br> - You're leaving us, Jock?<br> - Rather, but I'll be back.<br> Come on, darling, champagne!<br> And again and again and again!<br> Follow that cab!<br> - What cab, sir?<br> - No cab.<br> Some joke, huh? Take me to<br> the C.K. Dexter Haven mansion.<br> - Mr. Haven?<br> - Front entrance.<br> C.K. Dexter Haven!<br> This is where<br> Cinderella gets off.<br> You hurry back to the ball before you<br> turn into a pumpkin and six white mice.<br> Good-bye.<br> C.K. Dexter Haven.<br> - What's up?<br> - You are.<br> I hope it's worth it.<br> Come on in.<br> I bring you greetings.<br> Cinderella's slipper.<br> It's called champagne.<br> Champagne is a great "levelerer."<br> Leveler.<br> - It makes you my equal.<br> - I wouldn't quite say that.<br> Well, almost my equal.<br> C.K. Dexter Haven,<br> I would like to talk to you.<br> Let's go in the talking room.<br> - Don't tell me the party's over so soon.<br> - No, no.<br> - I just felt like talking to you.<br> - Well, that's nice.<br> I wonder if I might<br> borrow a drink.<br> Certainly.<br> Coals to Newcastle.<br> Here, sit down.<br> Excuse me.<br> What's this?<br> - Is it my book?<br> - Yes.<br> C.K. Dexter Haven,<br> you have unsuspected depth.<br> - Thanks, old chap.<br> - But have you read it?<br> I was trying to stop drinking.<br> I read anything.<br> - And did you stop drinking?<br> - Yes. Your book didn't do it, though.<br> Are you still in love with her?<br> Or perhaps you'd consider that<br> a very personal question.<br> - Not at all.<br> - Liz thinks you are!<br> Liz thinks you are.<br> But of course, women like to romanti...<br> romanticize about things.<br> - Yes, they do, don't they?<br> - Yes, they do, don't they?<br> I can't understand how you<br> could've been married to her...<br> and still know<br> so little about her.<br> - Can't you?<br> - No, I can't you.<br> I have the hiccups. I wonder<br> if I might have another drink?<br> - Certainly.<br> - Thank you.<br> You know, Tracy's<br> no ordinary woman...<br> and you said some things to her<br> this afternoon I resented.<br> - I apologize, Mr. Connor.<br> - That's quite all right.<br> But when a girl is like Tracy,<br> she's one in a million. She's...<br> She's sort of like a...<br> She's sort of like a...<br> - A goddess?<br> - No, no, no!<br> You said that word<br> this afternoon. No.<br> She's sort of like a queen...<br> a radiant, glorious queen...<br> and you can't treat her<br> like other women.<br> No, I suppose not. But then, I imagine<br> Kittredge appreciates all that.<br> Kittredge!<br> Kittredge appreciates Kittredge!<br> Ah, that fake "man of the people."<br> He isn't even smart.<br> He's a five-cent edition<br> of Sidney Kidd.<br> Well, I always thought Kidd himself<br> was the five-cent kid.<br> And what's that make you worth,<br> C.K. Dexter Haven...<br> bringing us down here?<br> But you know why I did that.<br> To get even with my ex-bride.<br> Doggone it, C.K. Dexter Haven...<br> either I'm gonna sock you<br> or you're gonna sock me!<br> Shall we toss a coin?<br> Kidd's just using you<br> like he uses everybody else.<br> You don't know Kidd<br> like I know him.<br> The guy's colossal. He's terrific.<br> He's got everybody fooled.<br> Yes.<br> "No mean Machiavelli<br> is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd.<br> "The world's his oyster<br> with an 'R' in every month."<br> That's not bad.<br> When did I say that?<br> You didn't. I did.<br> Sorry.<br> I suppose you never heard about<br> Kidd's arrangement in Kansas City?<br> - No.<br> - In San Francisco?<br> Let me tell you about<br> the time he went to Boston...<br> to be awarded the Sarah Langley<br> Medal for World Peace.<br> The true story on that<br> little jaunt would ruin him.<br> Look, Connor. What would happen<br> to you if I used this stuff?<br> - Why?<br> - I might want to, very much.<br> Kidd is holding a dirty piece<br> on Tracy's father.<br> - This might stop him.<br> - On Tracy's father?<br> That's right.<br> Oh, so that's how<br> Kidd got you to...<br> That's how Liz and I were gotten in.<br> Blackmail, huh?<br> We all rode into this thing<br> on a filthy blackmail.<br> Look, you use it.<br> Use it with my blessings.<br> I'm through anyway. I'm not gonna<br> hand in a story on this wedding.<br> - I'm gonna write one on Kidd.<br> - No, let me do it.<br> I don't have to tell him<br> where I got my facts. Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> - All right, come on.<br> Now shoot.<br> Peace medal. Boston.<br> Oh, oh.<br> The time: May, 1938.<br> The place:<br> Boston, in a hotel.<br> Kidd had just arrived.<br> And this same Sidney Kidd,<br> ladies and gentlemen of America...<br> this protector of American democracy<br> and homes and firesides...<br> was at that very moment<br> entertaining...<br> the South Carolina Mata Hari<br> on his yacht.<br> Don't interrupt me!<br> This Sidney Kidd,<br> ladies and gentlemen...<br> who demanded the respect...<br> of all who were<br> connected with him...<br> - We've come for the body of Macaulay.<br> - I'm glad you came.<br> - Can you use a typewriter?<br> - No, thanks. I have one at home.<br> Who's that?<br> Here was Sidney Kidd,<br> ladies and gentlemen...<br> Sidney Kidd the good,<br> Sidney Kidd the noble...<br> Where's Kittredge?<br> - The people's choice?<br> - Yeah.<br> His bride just dropped him at<br> the gatehouse after a slight explosion.<br> A fight?<br> Fifteen rounds, no decision.<br> Where's my wandering parakeet?<br> You look beautiful, Red.<br> Come on in.<br> Why?<br> No particular reason.<br> A drink, maybe?<br> I don't drink.<br> That's right. I forgot.<br> I haven't.<br> Show Liz to a typewriter<br> and stand back.<br> - Can she do it?<br> - She can and she will.<br> - Dictate to her and then bring her home.<br> - Aren't you coming, Liz?<br> It seems I've got to<br> commit suicide first.<br> - Going my way, Miss?<br> - Miss Goddess to you.<br> Okay, Miss Goddess to me.<br> Champagne's funny stuff.<br> I'm used to whiskey.<br> Whiskey's a slap on the back,<br> and champagne's...<br> heavy mist before my eyes.<br> Do you hear a telephone ringing?<br> I did a little while ago.<br> Let's see.<br> No, not yet.<br> Now I do, far away.<br> It's my bedroom telephone.<br> It couldn't be anyone but George.<br> I was sort of swinish to him.<br> Perhaps I'd better go<br> and see what...<br> It isn't ringing anymore.<br> I tell you what.<br> Let's have a quick swim<br> to brighten us up.<br> Dexter and I always<br> swam after parties.<br> Let's dip into this instead, huh?<br> - Hello, you.<br> - Hello.<br> - You look fine.<br> - I feel fine.<br> Did you enjoy the party?<br> Sure. Sure.<br> The prettiest sight<br> in this fine, pretty world...<br> is the privileged class<br> enjoying its privileges.<br> - You're a snob, Connor.<br> - No doubt. No doubt.<br> "Awash with champagne...<br> "was Will Q. Tracy's<br> pleasure dome...<br> "on the nuptial eve<br> of Tracy Samantha... Tracy..."<br> You can't marry that guy.<br> George? I'm going to.<br> - Why not?<br> - I don't know.<br> I thought I'd be for it at first,<br> but you don't seem to match up.<br> Then the fault's with me.<br> Maybe so. But all the same,<br> you can't do it.<br> Come around about noon tomorrow.<br> I mean today.<br> - Snob.<br> - What do you mean, "snob"?<br> You're the worst kind there is,<br> an intellectual snob.<br> You made up your mind<br> awfully young, it seems to me.<br> Thirty's about time<br> to make up your mind.<br> And I'm nothing of the sort.<br> Not Mr. Connor.<br> The time to make up<br> your mind about people...<br> is never.<br> Yes, you are,<br> and a complete one.<br> - You're quite a girl, aren't you?<br> - You think?<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> - I don't think I'm exceptional.<br> - You are, though.<br> - I know any number like me.<br> You oughta get around more.<br> What, in the upper class?<br> No, no.<br> No, thank you.<br> You're just a mass<br> of prejudices, aren't you?<br> You're so much thought<br> and so little feeling, Professor.<br> - I am, am I?<br> - Yes, you am, are you.<br> Your intolerance infuriates me!<br> I should think that, of all people,<br> a writer would need tolerance.<br> That fact is you'll never,<br> you can't be...<br> a first-rate writer<br> or a first-rate human being...<br> until you've learned to have<br> some small regard for human fra...<br> Aren't the geraniums<br> pretty, Professor?<br> Is it not a handsome day...<br> that begins, Professor?<br> - Lay off that "Professor."<br> - Yes, Professor.<br> You've got all the arrogance<br> of your class, all right.<br> How... what have classes<br> to do with it?<br> What do they matter<br> except for the people in them?<br> George comes from the so-called lower<br> class; Dexter from the upper. Well?<br> Mac, the night watchman, is a prince<br> among men; Uncle Willie is a pincher.<br> Upper and lower, my eye.<br> I'll take the lower, thanks.<br> If you can't get a drawing room.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> - My mistake.<br> - You're insulting!<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Oh, don't apologize!<br> - Who's apologizing?<br> I never knew such a man.<br> You wouldn't be likely to,<br> not from where you sit.<br> Talk about arrogance.<br> - Tracy.<br> - What do you want?<br> You're wonderful.<br> There's a magnificence<br> in you, Tracy.<br> Now I'm getting self-conscious.<br> It's funny, l...<br> Yeah?<br> I don't know.<br> Go up, I guess. It's late.<br> A magnificence that comes out<br> of your eyes and your voice...<br> in the way you stand there,<br> in the way you walk.<br> You're lit from within, Tracy.<br> You've got fires<br> banked down in you...<br> hearth fires and holocausts!<br> I don't seem to you<br> made of bronze?<br> No. You're made out<br> of flesh and blood.<br> That's the blank,<br> unholy surprise of it.<br> You're the golden girl, Tracy...<br> full of life and warmth<br> and delight.<br> What goes on?<br> You got tears in your eyes.<br> Shut up. Shut up.<br> Oh, Mike, keep talking.<br> Keep talking.<br> Talk, will you?<br> No, no, I've...<br> I've stopped.<br> Why?<br> Has your mind taken hold again,<br> dear Professor?<br> Well, it's a good thing,<br> don't you agree?<br> No, Professor.<br> Lay off that "Professor" stuff!<br> Do you hear me?<br> Yes, Professor.<br> - That's all I am to you?<br> - Of course, Professor.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Why, yes, of course...<br> Golly.<br> - Golly Moses!<br> - Tracy.<br> - Mr. Connor...<br> - Let me tell you something.<br> - I've got the shakes.<br> - It can't be anything like love, can it?<br> No, no, it mustn't be.<br> It can't.<br> - Would it be inconvenient?<br> - Terribly.<br> Anyway, I know it isn't.<br> - Mike, we're out of our minds.<br> - Right into our hearts.<br> - That ought to have music.<br> - It does, doesn't it?<br> It's as if my insteps<br> were melting away.<br> - Have I got feet of clay?<br> - Tracy.<br> It's not far to the pool.<br> It's in the birch grove.<br> - It'll be lovely now.<br> - Tracy, you're tremendous.<br> Put me in your pocket, Mike.<br> I can't imagine what<br> makes me so sleepy.<br> - It couldn't be the company.<br> - It's you, Mr. Dexter.<br> - Hello, Mac.<br> - I heard you were about.<br> - Any prowlers around?<br> - No prowlers.<br> - Can Miss lmbrie get in this way?<br> - Lf she can't, you can go in the back.<br> Good.<br> - Thanks, Mac. Good night.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> Well, home after<br> a hard day's blackmailing.<br> When are you going<br> to telephone Kidd?<br> In time to get him here<br> for the wedding.<br> Why?<br> A sort of wedding present,<br> if it works.<br> If it works.<br> I could still tear it up.<br> No. Mike's only chance to ever become<br> a really fine writer is to get fired.<br> You're a good number, Liz.<br> Oh, I just photograph well.<br> I'm certainly out of focus now.<br> Why don't you take a swim?<br> - A swim?<br> - Sure.<br> Tracy and I always<br> took a swim after a party.<br> - Did you?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Bet it was fun.<br> I'll have to try it<br> with Mike sometime.<br> Liz, why don't you marry him?<br> - You really want to know?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> He's still got a lot to learn.<br> I don't want to get<br> in his way for a while.<br> It's risky though, Liz.<br> Suppose another girl<br> came along in the meantime?<br> I'd scratch her eyes out,<br> I guess.<br> That is, unless she was going to<br> marry somebody else the next day.<br> - Hello, Kittredge.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> I'm a friend of the family's.<br> Dropped in for a chat.<br> Don't try to be funny.<br> I asked you a question.<br> I could ask you<br> the same question.<br> I telephoned Tracy,<br> and her phone didn't answer.<br> I was worried,<br> so I walked over.<br> - I was worried too.<br> - About what?<br> What do you think of<br> this fellow Connor, or do you?<br> If you're trying to insinuate...<br> My dear chap, I wouldn't<br> insinuate anything, only...<br> Kittredge,<br> I'd advise you to go to bed.<br> I don't want your advice.<br> I'm staying right here.<br> You're making a mistake.<br> Somehow I don't think you'll understand.<br> - Maybe you'd better leave that to...<br> - Dreams really do come true<br> Someday I'll wish upon a star<br> - What's that?<br> - It's Mac, the night watchman.<br> Always singing.<br> I'll walk you around the house.<br> Something's going on here,<br> and I'm staying.<br> And so are you.<br> All right, then.<br> Take the works.<br> Only heaven help you.<br> Somewhere over the rainbow<br> Way up high<br> There's a land<br> that I heard of<br> Once in a lullaby<br> And the dreams<br> That I dare to dre...<br> - Uh-oh.<br> - Don't stop, Mikey.<br> Keep crooning.<br> Someday over the rainbow<br> Way up high<br> - What is this, Connor?<br> - Easy, old man. She's not hurt?<br> - No, no.<br> - Not wounded, sire, but dead.<br> Seems the minute she hit the water,<br> the wine hit her.<br> - Look here, Connor.<br> - A likely story!<br> - What'd you say?<br> - A likely story!<br> - Lf you think that...<br> - You'll be down directly?<br> - Yes, if you want!<br> - I want.<br> Hello, Dexter.<br> Hello, George.<br> Hello, Mike.<br> Second door to the right,<br> top of the stairs. Don't wake Dinah.<br> My feet are made of clay.<br> Did you know?<br> Good night, little man.<br> How are the mighty fallen.<br> If I know Tracy,<br> and I know her well...<br> she'll remember little of this.<br> For the second time in her life,<br> she'll draw quite a tidy blank.<br> - You don't believe it, then?<br> - Believe what?<br> Well, the implications of<br> what you saw, let us say.<br> - What else am I to believe?<br> - That's entirely up to you.<br> I got eyes, I got imagination,<br> haven't I?<br> I don't know.<br> Have you?<br> Oh, so you pretend<br> not to believe it.<br> Yes, I pretend not to.<br> - Then you don't know women.<br> - That's possible.<br> - And you're a fool.<br> - That's quite possible.<br> - You won't be too hard on her?<br> - I'll make up my own mind what I'll be!<br> We're all only human, you know.<br> You! All of you with<br> your sophisticated ideas!<br> Ain't it awful?<br> Why, you low...<br> What right have you...<br> A husband's.<br> 'Til tomorrow, Kittredge.<br> Hey, fella.<br> How do you feel?<br> - Lf you think l...<br> - I know.<br> I'm sorry. I thought I'd better<br> hit you before he did.<br> He's in better shape than I am.<br> Well, you'll do.<br> Hello, Mr. Dexter.<br> Anything wrong?<br> Not a thing, Mac.<br> Just as quiet as a church.<br> Who is it?<br> Doggone. I thought it<br> might've been Mr. Kittredge.<br> We can't have everything, Mac.<br> Good night.<br> - Mr. Tracy...<br> - Good grief, man.<br> Don't scream at me at the top<br> of your voice like that.<br> Miss Dinah is waiting for you, sir.<br> Miss Dinah waiting for me?<br> Where and why?<br> Just outside the door, sir.<br> I don't know why.<br> This is one of those days<br> which the pages of history teach us...<br> are best spent lying in bed.<br> Uncle Willie!<br> Uncle Willie,<br> where are you going?<br> Back to bed, unless you<br> give me your oath...<br> you will speak in<br> a civilized tone of voice.<br> I'll be quiet, Uncle Willie.<br> It's so important that I see you.<br> Must we ride in that thing? Wouldn't we<br> be more comfortable on pogo sticks?<br> I had to be alone with you,<br> and this is very intimate.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Oh, nothing much.<br> My head just fell off, that's all.<br> What is all this gibberish<br> about Mr. Connor?<br> What makes you suspect what<br> and since when?<br> Last night,<br> and well into the morning.<br> Uncle Willie,<br> isn't my duty to tell George?<br> He might want to marry her anyway.<br> But she can't. If she marries anyone,<br> it's got to be Mr. Connor.<br> Why, Dinah.<br> What makes you think she should?<br> Apparently the little cherub<br> has heard or seen something.<br> That's Dexter's own Dinah.<br> You have a certain amount of cheek<br> walking in here on this of all mornings.<br> - Do I?<br> - Yes.<br> What's all this<br> about Mr. Connor, Dinah?<br> Did the party last night<br> give you bad dreams?<br> - It wasn't any dream.<br> - I wouldn't be too sure.<br> It's hard to tell once you've<br> gone to sleep, isn't it?<br> Is it?<br> What-ho, the bride.<br> Hello.<br> Um, isn't it a fine day, though.<br> Is everybody fine?<br> That's fine.<br> My, I'm hearty.<br> How do you feel otherwise?<br> I don't know what's the matter with me.<br> I must have had<br> too much sun yesterday.<br> - My eyes don't open properly.<br> - Really?<br> Ugh! Please go home, Dext.<br> Not until we've got<br> those eyes open.<br> Uncle Willie. Good morning.<br> That remains to be seen.<br> Aren't you here early,<br> Uncle Willie?<br> It's nearly half past twelve.<br> It can't be.<br> Where's Mother?<br> She's talking with the orchestra.<br> Father with the minister.<br> And Mr. Connor,<br> he hasn't come down yet.<br> And it's Saturday,<br> your wedding day, remember?<br> Thanks loads.<br> It's nice to have things account...<br> Only I wonder<br> what this might be.<br> - That looks like a wristwatch.<br> - But whose?<br> I found it in my room.<br> I nearly stepped on it.<br> Also, I think I was robbed at your house<br> last night, Uncle Willie.<br> My bracelet and engagement rings<br> are missing...<br> - Here you are.<br> - But you weren't at the party.<br> - Wasn't I?<br> - Were you?<br> Don't tell me you don't remember.<br> I do, now, sort of.<br> But there were such a lot of people.<br> I stayed so late.<br> You should have taken a quick swim<br> when you got home.<br> A swim?<br> A swim!<br> There! Now they're open.<br> That was just the beginning,<br> and it was no dream.<br> Do you suppose,<br> speaking of eye-openers...<br> That's the first sane remark<br> I've heard today. Come along.<br> I know a formula that can pop pennies<br> off the eyelids of dead Irishmen.<br> Dinah, if the conversation<br> should lag...<br> you might tell Tracy<br> about your dream.<br> - What did he say?<br> - Oh, nothing.<br> - What did he say?<br> - Oh, nothing.<br> Tray, I hate you to get married<br> and go away.<br> I'll miss you, darling.<br> I'll miss all of you.<br> You know, I did have the funniest<br> dream about you last night.<br> Did you? Do you like<br> my dress, Dinah?<br> - Yes, ever so much.<br> - Feels awfully heavy.<br> It was all certainly<br> pretty rooty-tooty.<br> - What was?<br> - My dream.<br> I dreamed I got up<br> and went over to the window.<br> Guess what I dreamed I saw coming over<br> out of the woods.<br> I haven't the faintest idea.<br> A skunk?<br> Well, sort of.<br> It was Mr. Connor.<br> Mr. Connor?<br> Yes, with his arms full of something,<br> and guess what it turned out to be.<br> - What?<br> - You, and some clothes.<br> Wasn't it funny? It was sort of like<br> as if you were coming from the pool.<br> The pool?<br> I'm going crazy. I'm standing here,<br> solidly, on my own two hands...<br> and going crazy.<br> - Then what?<br> - After a while, I opened my door...<br> and there he was in the hall,<br> still coming along with you...<br> puffing like a steam engine.<br> His wind can't be very good.<br> Then what?<br> - You were sort of crooning.<br> - I never crooned in my life.<br> I'm only saying<br> what it sounded like.<br> And then he...<br> Guess what.<br> I couldn't possibly.<br> He sailed right into your room<br> with you, and that scared me...<br> so I got up<br> and went to your door...<br> and peeked in<br> to make sure you were all right.<br> And guess what.<br> - What?<br> - You were. He was gone by then.<br> Gone?<br> Of course he was gone.<br> He was never there.<br> I know, Tracy.<br> - I should certainly hope you did.<br> - I'm certainly glad I do.<br> Because if I didn't, and in a little<br> while I heard the minister say...<br> "If anyone knows any just cause<br> or reason why these two...<br> "should not be united<br> in holy matrimony..."<br> I just wouldn't know what to do.<br> - Dexter says it's a dream too.<br> - You told Dexter all that?<br> Not a word.<br> Not a single word.<br> You know how quick he is.<br> You little fiend.<br> How can you stand there...<br> Dinah, your mother wants<br> to have a look at you.<br> I look wonderful.<br> I smell good too.<br> - Father?<br> - Yes, Tracy.<br> I'm glad you came back.<br> I'm glad you're here.<br> Thank you, child.<br> I'm sorry I'm... truly sorry<br> I'm a disappointment to you.<br> I never said that, daughter.<br> I never will.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Oh. Hello.<br> I'm testing the air.<br> I like it,<br> but it doesn't like me.<br> Hello, Dinah.<br> How do you do?<br> Did you have a good sleep?<br> Wonderful. Wonderful.<br> And you?<br> Marvelous. Have you<br> ever seen a handsomer day?<br> Never, never.<br> What'd it set you back?<br> I got it for nothing<br> for being a good girl.<br> Good. Good.<br> Don't worry, I'm going.<br> Why should you?<br> I guess you must have things<br> you wish to discuss.<br> Only remember, it's getting late.<br> She's always trying<br> to make situations.<br> - What's the matter with your chin?<br> - Chin?<br> Oh. Does it show that much?<br> A little. What happened?<br> I guess I stuck it out too far.<br> Into a door in the dark?<br> Yes, that's it.<br> What about you? You all right?<br> - Me?<br> - Yeah.<br> Of course.<br> Why shouldn't I be?<br> That was a flock of wine<br> we got away with.<br> I guess we're lucky<br> both to have such good heads.<br> Yeah, yeah, I guess that's it.<br> Well, anyway, I...<br> I had a simply wonderful evening.<br> I hope you enjoyed it too.<br> I enjoyed the last part of it.<br> Really?<br> Why especially the last?<br> Tracy, are you asking me?<br> - Oh, you mean the swim.<br> - Yeah.<br> We did swim...<br> and so forth, didn't we?<br> - Mike.<br> - Oh, Tracy, darling.<br> - What can I say to you?<br> - Not anything.<br> Don't say anything<br> and especially not "darling."<br> - You're going through with it?<br> - Through with what?<br> The wedding.<br> Why shouldn't I?<br> Well, I made a funny discovery.<br> In spite of the fact that<br> somebody's up from the bottom...<br> he can still be quite a heel...<br> and even though somebody else<br> is born to the purple, he...<br> he can still be<br> a very nice guy.<br> I'm just repeating<br> what you said last night.<br> I said a lot of things<br> last night, it seems.<br> Okay. No dice.<br> Also no regrets<br> about last night, huh?<br> Why should I have?<br> Tracy, you're wonderful.<br> I'm asking you. Tell me straight out.<br> Tell me the reason why I should have.<br> No, don't.<br> Just tell me, what time is it?<br> What? Oh.<br> What happened to my wristwatch?<br> Why, is it broken?<br> I must've lost it someplace.<br> I can't tell you how extremely sorry<br> I am to hear that.<br> There. On the table.<br> I wonder who found it.<br> I'd offer a reward or something.<br> I don't think that any reward<br> will be expected.<br> Funny that it'd pop up here.<br> Hey, what about an eye-opener?<br> My eyes are opened.<br> Go and get one if you want to, though.<br> Yeah, I think I will.<br> Excuse me.<br> Yes, yes.<br> Just give Mr. Kittredge a message.<br> Tell him he'd better start<br> immediately. Thank you.<br> - Are you one of the musicians?<br> - Uh, no.<br> Of course,<br> you're Junius's friend.<br> Only you're not. You don't have<br> any violin strings, do you?<br> - Aspirin. Will that do?<br> - I don't think so.<br> It's for a violin.<br> Oh, well, don't bother.<br> - Hello, Connor. How are you?<br> - Just about as you'd think.<br> You seen Kidd?<br> I left a copy of it<br> at my house for him.<br> - And?<br> - I'll tangle with him after the wedding.<br> - Is that an alcoholic beverage?<br> - Yes. Why?<br> - For me?<br> - No, for Tracy. You want one?<br> I'd sell my grandmother for a drink.<br> You know how I love my grandmother.<br> Uncle Willie's in the pantry<br> doing weird and wonderful things.<br> Tell him I said<br> one of the same.<br> Mind if I make it two?<br> That's between you<br> and your grandmother.<br> Doctor's orders, Red.<br> What is it?<br> Just the juice<br> of a few flowers.<br> It's a type of stinger.<br> Removes the sting.<br> - Oh, Dext, don't say that.<br> - Why not, Red?<br> Nothing will.<br> Nothing ever can.<br> I've done the most<br> terrible thing to you.<br> To me?<br> I doubt that very much, dear.<br> You don't know.<br> Maybe I shouldn't, huh?<br> But you must. You've got to.<br> I couldn't stand it if you didn't.<br> Dexter, what am I going to do?<br> But why to me, darling?<br> Why ask me?<br> Why do I come into it anymore?<br> Aren't you confusing me with a fellow<br> named Kittredge or something?<br> George!<br> George. Splendid chap, George.<br> Very high morals.<br> Very broad shoulders.<br> I've got to tell him.<br> - Tell him what, darling?<br> - I've got to tell him.<br> If you've got to tell him,<br> you've got to tell him.<br> If he's got any brains, he'll have<br> realized what a fool he made of himself.<br> Hello, George?<br> This is... yeah.<br> I don't care whether<br> it's bad luck or not...<br> but I've got to see you<br> before the wedding.<br> What? No, I didn't get it.<br> Right. Come on the run.<br> - He sent a note over at ten.<br> - Good.<br> I told you he'd come to his senses.<br> - Was he here too?<br> - Sure.<br> Good golly.<br> Why didn't you sell tickets?<br> Say something, Dext.<br> Say anything.<br> - No, you do.<br> - Oh, Dext!<br> I'm such an unholy mess of a girl.<br> That's no good.<br> That's not even conversation.<br> But never in my life...<br> not if I live to be a hundred...<br> will I ever forget how you tried<br> to stand me on my feet again today.<br> Oh, you, you're in great shape.<br> Tell me, what did you think<br> of my wedding present?<br> I like my presents<br> at least acknowledged, you know.<br> It was beautiful.<br> And sweet, Dext.<br> Yes. She was quite a boat,<br> the True Love, wasn't she?<br> Was and is.<br> My, she was yare!<br> She was yare, all right.<br> I wasn't, was I?<br> Not very.<br> You were good<br> at the bright work, though.<br> I made her shine.<br> Where is she now?<br> I'm gonna sell her to Rufe Watriss.<br> You're going to sell<br> the True Love for money?<br> - Sure.<br> - To that fat old rum pot?<br> Oh, well, what does it matter?<br> When you're through with a boat,<br> you're through.<br> Besides, it was only comfortable<br> for two people.<br> Unless you want her.<br> No. No, I don't want her.<br> I'm designing another one anyway...<br> along more practical lines.<br> What will you call her?<br> I thought the True Love II.<br> What do you think?<br> If you call any boat that, I promise<br> I'll blow you and it out of the water.<br> I'll tell you<br> what you can call her.<br> - What?<br> - In fond remembrance of me...<br> the Easy Virtue.<br> Shut up, Red. I can't have you thinking<br> things like that about yourself.<br> What am I supposed to think when l...<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know anything anymore.<br> That sounds very hopeful, Red.<br> That sounds just fine.<br> We're almost ready.<br> Stand up, dear.<br> Turn around.<br> Oh, yes, it's lovely.<br> I'm glad we decided against...<br> Dexter, you shouldn't be here...<br> against the blue one.<br> No games, Dexter.<br> George will be right over.<br> I just telephoned. Here's a note<br> he sent you this morning.<br> Oh, dear,<br> doesn't everything look lovely?<br> Dr. Parsons?<br> Mr. Kittredge hasn't arrived yet,<br> Dr. Parsons.<br> Come along. I want you<br> to meet Tracy's grandmother.<br> Tracy, don't sit down again<br> until after the ceremony.<br> Dexter, they telephoned from your house<br> that a Mr. Sidney Kidd was there.<br> I was to tell you that he's reading it.<br> Whatever does that mean?<br> I have a feeling it won't be<br> so hard for me to resign now.<br> And belts will be worn tighter<br> this winter.<br> Well, Red, I'm afraid<br> it's the deadline.<br> So is this. Listen.<br> "My dear Tracy, I want you to know<br> that you will always be my friend...<br> "but your conduct last night was so<br> shocking to my ideals of womanhood..."<br> No, don't go.<br> You might as well hear it too.<br> "To my ideals of womanhood<br> that my attitude toward you...<br> "and the prospect of a happy<br> and useful life together...<br> "has been changed materially.<br> - "Your breach of common decency..."<br> - Tracy.<br> Hello, George.<br> Tracy, all these people.<br> It's only a letter<br> from a friend.<br> They're my friends too.<br> "...certainly entitles me<br> to a full explanation...<br> "before going through<br> with our proposed marriage.<br> "In the light of day, I am sure<br> that you will agree with me.<br> "Otherwise, with profound regrets<br> and all best wishes...<br> "yours very sincere..."<br> Yes, George,<br> I quite agree with you.<br> In the light of day<br> and the dark of night...<br> for richer, for poorer,<br> for better, for worse...<br> in sickness and in health and...<br> Thank you so very much<br> for your good wishes at this time.<br> - That's all you have to say?<br> - What else?<br> I wish, for your sake<br> as well as mine...<br> I had an explanation, but...<br> unfortunately, I have none.<br> You'd better just say<br> good riddance, George.<br> - It isn't easy.<br> - I don't see why.<br> - Say something, stupid!<br> - Just wait a minute.<br> What for?<br> On the very eve of your wedding,<br> an affair with another man!<br> I told you I agree, and I'll<br> tell you again, good riddance to me.<br> Tracy, your attitude<br> is a little difficult to understand.<br> - Yes, I can see that it would be.<br> - Not necessarily.<br> - You keep out of this.<br> - You forget, I am out of it.<br> Kittredge, it may<br> interest you to know...<br> that this so-called "affair"<br> consisted of exactly two kisses...<br> and a late swim.<br> - Thanks, but...<br> - Which I enjoyed...<br> and the memory of which<br> I wouldn't part with for anything.<br> - It's no use, Mike.<br> - After which...<br> I deposited Tracy on her bed<br> in her room...<br> and returned down here to you two,<br> which doubtless you'll remember.<br> Doubtless without a doubt.<br> You mean to say<br> that was all there was to it?<br> I do.<br> Why? Was I so unattractive,<br> so distant, so forbidding or something?<br> - This is fine talk too.<br> - I'm asking a question.<br> You were extremely attractive,<br> and as for distant and forbidding...<br> on the contrary, but you also<br> were a little the worse...<br> or better... for wine,<br> and there are rules about that.<br> Thank you, Mike.<br> I think men are wonderful.<br> The little dears.<br> I fail to see the humor<br> in this situation, Miss lmbrie.<br> I can appreciate that.<br> It was hard for me too at first.<br> - Oh, Liz.<br> - It's all right, Tracy.<br> We all go haywire at times,<br> and if we don't, maybe we ought to.<br> You see, it really wasn't Tracy<br> at all, Mr. Kittredge.<br> It was another girl.<br> A Miss Pommery, 1926.<br> You'd had too much to drink, Tracy.<br> That seems to be<br> the consensus of opinion.<br> Will you promise me<br> never to touch the stuff again?<br> No, George.<br> I don't believe I will.<br> There are certain things<br> about that other girl...<br> that... Miss Pommery '26,<br> I rather like.<br> - But a man expects his wife...<br> - To behave herself. Naturally.<br> To behave herself naturally.<br> Sorry.<br> If it hadn't been for that drink last<br> night, all this might not have happened.<br> Apparently nothing did.<br> What made you think it had?<br> Well, it didn't take<br> much imagination.<br> Not much, perhaps,<br> but just of a certain kind.<br> It seems you didn't think<br> anything too well of yourself.<br> That's the odd thing.<br> Somehow I'd have hoped that you'd<br> think better of me than I did.<br> I'm not going to quibble.<br> All the evidence was there.<br> And I was guilty straight off<br> until I was proved innocent.<br> Downright un-American,<br> if you ask me.<br> Nobody is asking you.<br> You forgot your hat, Miss Tracy.<br> You look lovely, Miss Tracy.<br> All our very best wishes.<br> Dexter, I wish you'd let me know when<br> you invite people to Tracy's weddings.<br> - What happened, darling?<br> - A Mr. Sidney Kidd is here.<br> He says he knows you.<br> Sidney Kidd is here himself?<br> What else did Mr. Sidney Kidd<br> have to say?<br> He sent you the strangest message.<br> He said, "Tell Haven he wins."<br> "Tell him I'm licked."<br> Wins what, Dexter?<br> Mr. Sidney Kidd's presence here makes<br> the marriage of national importance.<br> I think it's extremely kind<br> and thoughtful of him.<br> Come on, Tracy, it must be late.<br> Let's let bygones be bygones.<br> What do you say?<br> Yes, and good-bye, George.<br> - I don't understand you.<br> - Please, good-bye.<br> - Look here...<br> - You're too good for me.<br> - You're a hundred times too good.<br> - But I never said...<br> I'd make you most unhappy. Most.<br> That is, I'd do my best to.<br> Well, if that's<br> the way you want it.<br> That's the way it is.<br> All right.<br> Possibly it's just as well.<br> Yes, I thought you'd finally<br> come to that conclusion.<br> I have a feeling you had more<br> to do with this than anyone.<br> - Possibly, but you were a great help.<br> - You and your whole rotten class.<br> Class, my eye.<br> You're on your way out,<br> the lot of you, and good riddance!<br> There goes George.<br> Oh, my sainted aunt!<br> - That welter of faces.<br> - Oh, my, they look solemn.<br> What am I to do?<br> - Tracy?<br> - Yes, Mike?<br> Parson Parsons has never seen<br> Kittredge before, has he?<br> I got you into this thing,<br> and I'll get you out of it.<br> Will you marry me, Tracy?<br> No, Mike.<br> Thanks, but hmm-mm. Nope.<br> I've never asked a girl<br> to marry me.<br> I've avoided it.<br> But you've got me<br> all confused now.<br> Why not?<br> Because I don't think Liz<br> would like it...<br> and I'm not sure you would...<br> and I'm even a little doubtful<br> about myself.<br> But I am beholden to you, Mike.<br> I'm most beholden.<br> But they're in there.<br> They're waiting.<br> Don't get too conventional all at once,<br> will ya? There'll be a reaction.<br> Cheer up. It'll be all right.<br> You've been got out of jams before.<br> - Been got out of them?<br> - Certainly.<br> Don't worry.<br> You always have been.<br> We've seen George.<br> It's all right, dear.<br> Your father will make<br> a very simple announcement.<br> Is there anything special<br> you want me to say, Tracy?<br> Uh, no, no.<br> I'll say it.<br> Whatever it is, I'll say it. I won't<br> be got out of anything anymore, thanks.<br> Hello.<br> Good morning. L...<br> Stop that music.<br> I'm sorry to have kept you waiting...<br> but there's been a slight hitch<br> in the proceedings.<br> I've made a terrible fool of myself,<br> which isn't unusual...<br> and my fianc...<br> my fianc that was, that is...<br> he thinks we'd better call it a day,<br> and I quite agree with him.<br> Peace is wonderful.<br> Uh, bec... uh...<br> Dexter, what next?<br> Three years ago I did you out of<br> a wedding in this house by eloping.<br> - Two years ago, you were invited...<br> - My dear, just a loan.<br> - Put this in your vest pocket.<br> - Don't have a vest.<br> Then hold it in your hand.<br> - Which was very bad manners.<br> - Which was very bad manners.<br> I'll make it up to you by going through<br> with it now as originally planned.<br> I'll make it up to you by...<br> by going beautifully through<br> with it now...<br> as originally and<br> most beautifully planned.<br> - So if you'll just keep your seats...<br> - So if you'll just keep your seats...<br> - That's all.<br> - Um, that's all.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - No, but I'll risk it. Will you?<br> You bet. You didn't do it to soften<br> the blow? Nor to save my face?<br> - No, it's a nice face.<br> - I'll be yare now.<br> - I'll promise to be yare.<br> - Be whatever you like. You all set?<br> - All set.<br> - Best man?<br> Honored, C.K.<br> - Maid of honor?<br> - Matron of honor.<br> Remember Joe Smith.<br> How did this ever happen?<br> You'd better tell Mr. Dutton<br> to start the music.<br> This can't be happening. It just can't.<br> Come with me, Miss lmbrie.<br> Let's get in there.<br> Got the ring?<br> The way we're dressed,<br> we look like stowaways.<br> See ya soon, Red.<br> See ya soon, Dext.<br> - Tracy, darling...<br> - I love you, Father.<br> I love you too.<br> Never in my life have I been<br> so full of love before.<br> Come along. Come along.<br> Wait. How do I look?<br> Like a queen.<br> Like a goddess.<br> - And you know how I feel?<br> - How?<br> Like a human.<br> Like a human being.<br> - Do you know how I feel?<br> - How?<br> Proud.<br> I did it.<br> I did it all.<br> I feel as though I've lived through<br> all this before in another life.<br>
