                        - Mr. Szpilman?<br> - Hello.<br> I came specially to meet you.<br> I love your playing.<br> - Who are you?<br> - My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.<br> - You're bleeding!<br> - It's nothing.<br> You can write him a fan letter later.<br> This isn't the best time. Come on.<br> Jurek, where have you been<br> hiding her?<br> - I don't know what to take.<br> - You always take too much.<br> How many suitcases are you taking?<br> What do you think, should I take<br> uncle Szymon's portrait?<br> Take it, don't take it,<br> take what you like.<br> Can't you see I'm worried sick?<br> He'll come home, he'll be alright.<br> - I should have another case.<br> - Mama, Wladek is home!<br> Thank God.<br> Wladek! You're wounded?<br> - No, it was nothing.<br> - I've been worried sick.<br> I told her not to worry.<br> You had your papers on you.<br> If you'd been hit by a bomb,<br> they'd know where to take you.<br> Henryk, don't say things like that.<br> God forbid. God forbid.<br> - Papa, Wladek is home.<br> - What did I tell you?<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Where's my hat with the wide brim?<br> - They've bombed us. We're off the air.<br> - Warsaw is not the only radio station.<br> Pack, darling.<br> Get your things packed.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - Out of Warsaw.<br> - Out of Warsaw where?<br> - You haven't heard?<br> - Heard what?<br> - Haven't you seen the paper?<br> - Where's the paper?<br> - I used it for packing.<br> - She used it for packing.<br> - The government has moved to Lublin.<br> All men must leave the city, go across<br> the river, set up a new line of defense.<br> There isn't anybody left here, only<br> the women. The men are all gone.<br> What do you think you'll do while<br> they set up a new line of defense?<br> - Wonder around with your suitcases?<br> - Pack, Wladek. There's no time.<br> - I'm not going anywhere.<br> - Good. I'm not going anywhere either.<br> Don't be ridiculous,<br> we've got to keep together.<br> Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to<br> die in my own home, staying put.<br> - God forbid.<br> - Shut up, I've got something. Listen.<br> ...from the BBC in London.<br> The British government...<br> having received no reply<br> to the observations presented...<br> to the German government...<br> has declared war on nazi Germany.<br> - That's wonderful! Wonderful!<br> - It is expected that...<br> ...within the next few hours, France<br> will make a similar declaration.<br> Poland is no longer alone.<br> Wonderful, wonderful!<br> - Mama, that was a great dinner.<br> - It certainly was.<br> When there's something to celebrate,<br> you've got to make an effort.<br> Here's to Great Britain and France!<br> Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?<br> All will be well.<br> Five thousand and three.<br> - Is that all?<br> - Yes. It's all we've got left.<br> - It's 3,003 too much.<br> - Look.<br> "Further restrictions<br> regarding liquid assets.<br> Jews will be allowed to keep a<br> maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "<br> - What do we do with the rest?<br> - Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.<br> Banks! Who'd be stupid enough<br> to deposit money in a German bank?<br> We could hide the money. Look here.<br> We can hide it under the flowerpots.<br> I'll tell you what we'll do.<br> We'll use try and tested methods.<br> You know what we did<br> in the last war?<br> We made a hole in the table leg,<br> and hid the money in there.<br> - Suppose they take the table away?<br> - What do you mean?<br> Germans go into Jewish homes and<br> take furniture, valuables, anything.<br> - Do they?<br> - Why'd they want a table like this?<br> - What on earth are you doing?<br> - Listen. Look.<br> This is the best place. No-one would<br> think of looking under the flowerpot.<br> - No, listen. I've been thinking...<br> - Really? That's a change.<br> - You know what? We use psychology.<br> - We use what?<br> We leave the money and the watch<br> on the table, covered. In full view.<br> - Are you stupid?<br> - The Germans will never notice it.<br> That's the stupidest thing I've ever<br> seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.<br> Look here.<br> Idiot.<br> - And you call me stupid.<br> - Very good. That's the last place...<br> - This would take hours.<br> - We're not in a hurry.<br> - It won't take hours.<br> - How will you get them out? Tell me.<br> - How will you get them out?<br> - Quiet! Order, please!<br> - You reach them out individually.<br> - No-one listens to me!<br> Quiet, please, quiet.<br> Order, order, please.<br> - The lawyer, she likes order.<br> - Listen, just listen. Look.<br> The watch we put under the flowerpot<br> and the money we stuff in the violin.<br> - But I'll still be able to play?<br> - You'll find out.<br> - Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.<br> - Wladek, how are you?<br> We're fine, thank you.<br> And you?<br> Fine, under the circumstances.<br> I guess I know why you're calling.<br> There's nothing we can do.<br> They won't reopen the station.<br> - Yes, I know, but I...<br> - No music, no radio for the Polish.<br> But sure you'll find work.<br> A pianist like you.<br> Maybe, maybe not, but...<br> don't be offended, but I didn't call<br> to discuss my future carrier.<br> I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,<br> and at last he gave in and said...<br> "All right, come with me tomorrow",<br> so I came and...<br> they bombed the station.<br> - Meeting you like that was wonderful.<br> - Really?<br> Yes, it was unforgettable.<br> - I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.<br> - Call me Wladek, please.<br> - No-one plays Chopin like you.<br> - I hope it's a compliment.<br> - Of course, I mean it.<br> - I was... trying to be funny.<br> - Should we go and have a coffee?<br> - I'd like that.<br> - And you, what do you do?<br> - I finished with the conservatoire.<br> - You're a musician?<br> - Yes. But only just.<br> - What instrument?<br> - The cello.<br> I love to see women<br> playing the cello.<br> JEWS FORBIDDEN<br> This is disgraceful.<br> How dare they?<br> You know what people are like, they<br> want to be better nazis than Hitler.<br> - I'm going in there to complain.<br> - It's better not, believe me.<br> - It's humiliating. Someone like you!<br> - Good-bye.<br> We'll find somewhere else.<br> - We can walk in the park.<br> - No, we can't.<br> Official decree.<br> No Jews allowed in the park.<br> - My God. Are you joking?<br> - I'm not joking, it's true.<br> We could sit in a bench, but<br> "no Jews allowed on public benches".<br> This is absurd.<br> We can just stand here and talk.<br> I think we're allowed to do that.<br> So, you play the cello. That's nice.<br> And who's your favorite composer?<br> Chopin? Really? Well...<br> you'll have to learn to play<br> his cello sonata, won't you?<br> What about you, Wladek?<br> Perhaps I could accompany.<br> Me on the piano, you on the cello.<br> Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,<br> quite wonderful.<br> Call me Wladek, please.<br> "Free emblems for Jews<br> in the Warsaw district.<br> I hereby order that all Jews<br> in the Warsaw district...<br> will wear visible emblems<br> when out of doors.<br> This decree will come into force<br> on the first of December, 1939...<br> and applies to all Jews<br> over 12 years of age.<br> The emblem will be worn<br> on the right sleeve...<br> and will represent the blue star<br> of David on a white background.<br> The background must be<br> sufficiently large...<br> for the star to measure eight<br> centimeters from point to point.<br> The width of the arms of the star<br> must be one centimeter.<br> The Jews that do not respect this<br> decree will be severely punished.<br> Governor of the Warsaw district,<br> Dr. Fischer. "<br> - I won't wear it.<br> - I'm not going to be branded.<br> Let me see this.<br> Does it say that we have to provide<br> these armbands ourselves?<br> - Where will we get them?<br> - We're not going to wear them.<br> You!<br> Come here.<br> Why haven't you greeted us?<br> I'm sorry.<br> The sidewalk is forbidden for you.<br> Go to the gutter.<br> - Have you seen this?<br> - What? What? I'm working. What?<br> What is this?<br> - It's where they're going to put us.<br> - What do you mean "put us"?<br> "By order of the governor of the<br> Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...<br> concerning the establishment of<br> the Jewish district in Warsaw.<br> There'll be created a Jewish district<br> in which Jews will have to reside. "<br> Look here. "Jews living outside<br> of the prescribed area...<br> will have to move to the Jewish<br> district by 31 of October, 1940."<br> They won't get all of us.<br> It's too small.<br> There's 400 thousand of us<br> in Warsaw.<br> No, 360 thousand.<br> So it will be easy.<br> What am I supposed to do?<br> You tell me.<br> Mama?<br> Mama, what is it?<br> That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.<br> What can I buy with 20 zlotys?<br> I'm sick of cooking potatoes,<br> potatoes, potatoes.<br> That's the price.<br> That's what I'm offering.<br> My advice is to accept.<br> You won't get more from anyone else.<br> - But it's a Bechstein!<br> - 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.<br> What are you going to do when<br> you're hungry? Eat the piano?<br> - Get out!<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Stop it!<br> - We'd rather give it away. Get out!<br> Haven't you eaten today?<br> What are you suffering from?<br> You people are crazy.<br> I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand<br> and I'm paying for the removal.<br> I'm not even charging<br> for the removal!<br> You haven't eaten today.<br> You're crazy.<br> Take it.<br> Hello.<br> Hello. Hi.<br> I didn't want to come.<br> I didn't want to see all this, but...<br> I couldn't stop myself.<br> - How are you doing?<br> - Fine.<br> Good.<br> No, not really.<br> They arrested my cousin.<br> Jurek says they'll let him out.<br> - This is disgraceful.<br> - It won't last long. Don't worry.<br> That's what I said myself.<br> It's too absurd.<br> I... I should go.<br> Well, I'll see you...<br> soon.<br> Good-bye.<br> Well...<br> to tell you the truth,<br> I thought it would be worse.<br> - Where will we sleep?<br> - I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.<br> You, Henryk and papa, in here.<br> Look.<br> Come and look.<br> Go away.<br> Go away! Go away!<br> Papa! Papa!<br> - Sell anything?<br> - Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".<br> - 3 zlotys.<br> - It's better than yesterday.<br> Three lousy zlotys. And there are<br> people there making millions.<br> - I know.<br> - You don't know, believe me.<br> They bribe the guards,<br> the guards turn a blind eye.<br> They bring cartloads of food,<br> tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.<br> And the poor are dying all around<br> and they don't give a damn.<br> Excuse me, have you seen<br> my husband, Izaak Szerman?<br> A tall handsome man,<br> with a little gray beard.<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> - Excuse me. Good-bye.<br> Sleep well. But if you see him,<br> write to me, yes?<br> Izaak Szerman.<br> Why do we have to have a gentile<br> street running through our area?<br> Why can't they go around?<br> Don't worry. They're about to build<br> a bridge. Haven't you heard?<br> A bridge! Those idiots.<br> The Germans claim to be intelligent.<br> But do you know what I think?<br> I think they're totally stupid.<br> I have a family to feed.<br> I spend half of my time here...<br> waiting for them to let us through.<br> Maybe they think I come here<br> to listen to the music?<br> - What is it? Are you in a hurry?<br> - What's wrong with you?<br> - Come on, do something.<br> - Right. Dance!<br> - Dance!<br> - Dance!<br> Come on, come on! Dance!<br> Very well.<br> What about you?<br> Dance with him.<br> Let's clear the street,<br> so the Jews can dance.<br> Come on. And you.<br> Go on.<br> Faster!<br> Come on!<br> Faster!<br> Come on!<br> Faster!<br> Come on, move! I said faster!<br> Come on, Jews!<br> - Keep dancing.<br> - Dance.<br> Good, they're here.<br> Itzak Heller has been<br> waiting for you.<br> - What's this about?<br> - Sit down, have tea.<br> I'll start lunch<br> when the girls get here.<br> - So, what are you doing here?<br> - He brought cakes.<br> His father is back in the jewellery<br> business. He's doing well.<br> Amazing, jewellery.<br> - We're recruiting.<br> - Who is recruiting?<br> Don't be clever with me.<br> I'm coming as a friend.<br> They're bringing Jews in<br> from all over the country.<br> Soon there will be half million people<br> in the ghetto.<br> - We need more Jewish police.<br> - More Jewish police!<br> You want me to beat up Jews<br> and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.<br> - Someone has got to do it.<br> - But why me?<br> I thought you only recruited boys<br> with rich fathers.<br> Look at my father, look at us...<br> I'm looking at you, that's why I'm<br> here. You can have a better life.<br> - You want to survive selling books?<br> - Yes, please.<br> I'm doing you people a favor.<br> What about you?<br> You're a great pianist.<br> We've got a police jazz band.<br> They'd welcome you with open arms.<br> - Join us. You've got no work.<br> - Thank you, I've got work.<br> I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.<br> Who wants me to stop?<br> I always say,<br> look on the bright side.<br> You're in a small ghetto with<br> intellectuals, professional people.<br> You're better off than us. Here in<br> the large ghetto it's a cesspool.<br> - You have to give me something.<br> - You're an artist...<br> you keep peoples' spirits up.<br> You do enough.<br> - I want to help, do something.<br> - You're too well known.<br> And you know what? You musicians<br> don't make good conspirators.<br> You're too... too musical.<br> - Who is that?<br> - Symche.<br> Majorek.<br> There are notices going up. City is<br> to be cleansed of the undesirables.<br> - There's always notices going up.<br> - Hello, Symche.<br> Dyrek.

Maybe the whole world.<br> Wladyslaw Szpilman,<br> meet Majorek.<br> - How do you do?<br> - I know your name.<br> - I've never heard you play.<br> - Majorek used to be in the Army.<br> Brilliant man. The only thing I've got<br> against him is he's not a socialist.<br> You better go now, Wladek.<br> It's nearly curfew.<br> You know how many copies<br> we print of our newspaper?<br> Five hundred.<br> You know how many people on<br> average read one copy? Twenty.<br> That makes 10 thousand readers.<br> This will start the uprising.<br> Majorek hides them in his underpants<br> and leaves them in toilets.<br> - Toilets?<br> - As many toilets as I can find.<br> Germans never use Jewish toilets.<br> They're too clean for them.<br> Please, mister, please.<br> Hold it!<br> You little bastard!<br> Take this!<br> Stop it!

They let a Pole<br> to come in to operate on a Jew?<br> He got a pass, that's all I know.<br> Anyway, so...<br> he puts the patient to sleep<br> and starts the operation.<br> He'd just made the first incision<br> when the SS burst in...<br> shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja<br> and everybody else who was there.<br> Isn't that a laugh?<br> The patient didn't feel a thing,<br> he was anesthetized.<br> I said nothing bad.<br> What's the matter with you all?<br> You lost your sense of humor?<br> It's not funny.<br> You know what's funny?

For my tie?<br> The American Jews,<br> and there are lots of them.<br> What do they think they're doing?<br> People here are dying.<br> Haven't got a bite to eat.<br> The Jewish bankers should persuade<br> America to declare war on Germany.<br> The lights!

Izaak Szerman?<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> - Tall, handsome, little gray beard.<br> If you see him, write to me.<br> Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.<br> What happened here?<br> They've got my grandson. They<br> pick them up and take them away.<br> What they do to them,<br> I've stopped believing in God.<br> Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> Itzak?<br> Itzak?<br> Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.<br> - Henryk is in there.<br> - I haven't seen him.<br> Believe me.<br> They picked him up.<br> - Can you help?<br> - Now you need me. Now you need me!<br> Can you help us?<br> - It costs.<br> - I have no money.<br> Then there's nothing I can do.<br> You should have joined us.<br> - They told me you had influence.<br> - Who told you?<br> People I know. They said<br> you're an important man.<br> Itzak...<br> - Hands up.<br> - How are you?<br> - How are you?<br> - You, bandit.<br> Dead!

Every<br> zloty I earn we spend on food.<br> - I can look after myself.<br> - They were taking you away.<br> It's got nothing to do with you.<br> It's me they wanted, not you.<br> Why do you have to interfere<br> with other people's business?<br> - You're mad. That's your trouble.<br> - That's also my business.<br> What's the matter?<br> Are you sick?<br> Hungry.<br> Employment certificate. What's that<br> mean, no employment certificate?<br> You have to have an<br> employment certificate...<br> to work for the Germans<br> in the ghetto, otherwise...<br> - Otherwise what?<br> - You'll be deported.<br> - So the rumors were true.<br> - They're going to resettle us...<br> and send us to labor camps,<br> in the East.<br> - They're closing the small ghetto.<br> - Oh, God!<br> Wladek? Wladek?<br> I thought you were on tour playing<br> in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.<br> - Not this week.<br> - You look terrible.<br> Have you heard the rumors? They're<br> going to resettle us in the East.<br> Rumors! You take it all too much<br> to heart. What's the trouble?<br> I've been trying to get the certificate<br> of employment for my father.<br> I managed to get one for me and my<br> family, but I need one for my father.<br> - I've been to all the firms and shops...<br> - Why didn't you come to me?<br> I didn't know you were<br> in the certificate business.<br> I'm not, but Majorek is.<br> Can you help?<br> I have no money.<br> Please, don't insult us.<br> Can you do something for him?<br> Be at the Schultz workshop<br> tomorrow, four o'clock.<br> See what a wonderful piece<br> of luck you've had today?<br> That's the historical imperative in<br> action! That's why I always say:<br> - "Look on the bright side!"<br> - Yes, I know.<br> - How's your back?<br> - Better.<br> Better?<br> Better not ask.<br> - Thank you.<br> - My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.<br> Thank you, Mr. Schultz.<br> At least we got work<br> in the ghetto.<br> At least we are still together.<br> Everybody out!<br> To the courtyard!<br> Move, move!<br> We are workers. We have<br> employment certification.<br> Wait.<br> Here.<br> Go over there. Hurry.<br> You.<br> You. You.<br> You.<br> You.<br> You.<br> The others, put your clothes on<br> and come back here.<br> Bring your things with you.<br> Where are you taking us?<br> I'm sorry, I did my best.<br> - I thought the certificates'd save us.<br> - Stop it, Wladek.<br> Let's just hope that Henryk<br> and Halina will be better off.<br> - Where will we be going?<br> - You're going to work.<br> You'll be much better off than<br> in the stinking ghetto. Move.<br> Why did I do it? Why did I do it?<br> Why did I do it?<br> Why did I do it?<br> Why did I do it?<br> Don't you have a bottle of water?<br> He's dying.<br> My child is dying of thirst.<br> - I beg you.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Don't you have water? I beg you.<br> - Can you hear what I'm saying?<br> - I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.<br> - I can hear you.<br> Letting them take us to our death<br> like sheep to the slaughter.<br> - Not so loud.<br> - Why don't we attack them?<br> There's half a million of us here.<br> We can break out of the ghetto.<br> At least we can die honorably, not<br> as a stain on the face of History.<br> Why are you so sure they're<br> sending us to our death?<br> You know why I'm not sure?<br> Because they didn't tell me.<br> - They're going to wipe us all out.<br> - What do you want me to do? Fight?<br> To fight, we need organization,<br> plans, guns.<br> He's right. Do you think I'm going<br> to fight with my violin bowl?<br> The Germans would never squander<br> a huge labor force like this.<br> They're sending us to a labor camp,<br> it's obvious.<br> Sure.<br> Look at that cripple, the old people,<br> the children. They're going to work?<br> Look at you. You're going to carry<br> logs on your back?<br> Henryk! Halina, Henryk!<br> I missed you.<br> I wanted to be with you!<br> I wanted to be with you!<br> Stupid. Stupid.<br> Why did I do it? Why did I do it?<br> She's getting on my nerves.<br> - What did she do, for God's sake?<br> - She smothered her baby.<br> They prepared a hiding place<br> and of course they went there.<br> The baby cried<br> just as the police came.<br> She smothered the cries with<br> her hands, the baby died.<br> A policeman heard the death rattle<br> and found where they were hiding.<br> What are you reading?<br> "If you prick us, de we not bleed?<br> If you tickle us, do we not laugh?<br> If you poison us, do we not die?<br> And, if you wrong us,<br> shall we not revenge?"<br> - Very appropriate.<br> - Yes. That's why I brought it.<br> Idiot. What does he think<br> he's gonna do with the money?<br> Boy, come here.<br> Come here.<br> - How much for a caramel?<br> - 20 zlotys.<br> For one caramel? What do you think<br> you're gonna do with the money?<br> We've got 20 between us.<br> I've got 10, I think.<br> - Halina?<br> - What?<br> - It's a funny time to say this, but...<br> - What?<br> I wish I knew you better.<br> Thank you.<br> Szpilman?<br> Papa? Papa?<br> Mama? Halina?<br> Halina? Mama?<br> What do you think you're doing?<br> I've saved your life. Just go! Go!<br> Don't run!<br> Anna!<br> Anna!<br> Off they go to the melting pot.<br> - This stays.<br> - Give it to me!<br> What are you doing?<br> She's pregnant.<br> Wladek?<br> Why are you here, Wladek?<br> It's like this, I...<br> We...<br> All of them, all of them.<br> All of them.<br> Perhaps they're lucky.<br> The quicker, the better.<br> It's not finished yet. We'll stay<br> here for a couple of days...<br> until things die down.<br> I've bribed the policeman,<br> he'll come when it's over.<br> Attention!<br> On the march!<br> Onward!<br> My God, I haven't been outside in,<br> it must be two years.<br> Don't get overexcited.<br> It's gold.<br> Very good price.<br> Someone you know?<br> A beauty.<br> Who is she?<br> She's a singer. I knew her well.<br> Her husband is an actor.<br> They're good people.<br> I'd like to talk to her.<br> Don't forget, Wladek.<br> They hang them for helping Jews.<br> Turn left!<br> On the march!<br> Stop! Halt!<br> Attention!<br> At ease.<br> Turn right!<br> Step forward.<br> You.<br> You. You.<br> You.<br> Down on the ground!<br> Down on the ground!<br> Turn left!<br> On the march.<br> How long have you been here?<br> Since last night.<br> I was pleased to see you.<br> They're going to start<br> the final resettlement now.<br> We know what it means.<br> We sent someone out.<br> Zygmund, a good man.<br> His orders were to follow<br> the trains out of Warsaw.<br> He got to Sokolow.<br> A man told him the tracks divided,<br> one branch's leading to Treblinka.<br> He said everyday freight trains<br> carrying people from Warsaw...<br> branch off to Treblinka<br> and return empty.<br> No transports of food<br> are ever seen on that line.<br> The civilians are forbidden<br> to approach the Treblinka station.<br> They're exterminating us.<br> It won't take them long.<br> We are 60 thousand left,<br> out of half a million.<br> Mostly young people.<br> And this time we're gonna fight.<br> We're in good shape.<br> Organized.<br> We're prepared.<br> If you need help, I...<br> You! Come here!<br> Shit!<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> I don't know what I was thinking.<br> Take this! Take this!<br> Take him away.<br> I hope you play the piano better<br> than you carry bricks.<br> He won't last long<br> if he goes on like this.<br> I'll see if I can get him<br> something better.<br> Trouble.<br> Round up only the Jews!<br> Round up!<br> Only the Jews.<br> The Polish keep working.<br> Only the Jews.<br> I have good news for you.<br> There are rumors going around<br> that we like to...<br> to resettle you.<br> I promise you that now<br> and in the future...<br> nothing else is planned.<br> For this reason, we put<br> information posters on the wall.<br> To show you our goodwill...<br> you should vote one of you<br> to be allowed...<br> to go in town daily...<br> and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...<br> and one loaf of bread<br> for each of your workers.<br> So, why should we do something<br> like this if we'd resettle you?<br> You can make good business<br> out of the things you don't eat.<br> Isn't that something that you Jews<br> are good in? Making money?<br> Dismiss them.<br> That one, with the string.<br> The others, tied by wire.<br> Now!<br> Majorek.<br> I have a favor to ask.<br> I want to get out of here.<br> It's easy to get out. It's how you'll<br> survive on the other side that's hard.<br> I know.<br> Last summer, I worked for a day<br> in the Zelazna Brama Square.<br> I saw someone I knew,<br> she's an old friend.<br> A singer, her husband<br> is an actor.<br> I've filled their names down and<br> their address, if they're still there.<br> Janina Godlewska and Andrzej<br> Bogucki. They're good people.<br> Would you try to make contact?<br> You go to town everyday. Ask them<br> if they'd help me get out of here.<br> Have you got any plaster?<br> What are you up to?<br> What have you got there?<br> We are allowed to take<br> food to the ghetto.<br> Three kilos of potato and bread.<br> Open it.<br> - It's only potatoes and bread.<br> - You're lying. That's not true.<br> Open it.<br> Potatoes!<br> You Jews are all alike.<br> We reach you with a finger...<br> and you take the whole hand.<br> If you lie to me again,<br> I'll kill you. Personally.<br> I've tried your friends.<br> - They don't live there anymore.<br> - Did you make contact?<br> - Be ready to leave.<br> - When?<br> - Soon.<br> - Halt!<br> Shit! Shit!<br> Wait. What's going on here?<br> Take this! Take this!<br> I'll teach you some discipline,<br> you dirty Jews.<br> Do you know why<br> you're being hit?<br> - No.<br> - Do you know why you're being hit?<br> - Why?<br> - To celebrate New Year.<br> On the march!<br> March and sing!<br> Sing something nice!<br> Loud and clear!<br> Reunite tonight<br> And follow the white eagle<br> Stand up and fight<br> Our mortal enemies<br> Rise on the day<br> Let's give them fire and brimstone<br> We'll do away<br> The Yoke of slavery<br> Punish and rout<br> The rapists of our nation<br> We'll slash them out<br> To save our dignity<br> Come.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.<br> We haven't much time.<br> Come on.<br> We must hurry.<br> Here. See if this fit.<br> We have to keep moving you.

But it's safe.<br> It's not going to be very comfortable.<br> I'll be fine.<br> Thank you.<br> Here. Here. Give it to me.<br> Go as near to the front as possible,<br> to the German section.<br> DO NOT PASS<br> I'm going to draw the curtains now.<br> But you leave them open<br> during the day. Don't forget.<br> Must feel better on<br> this side of the wall, eh?<br> Yes.<br> But sometimes I'm still not sure<br> which side of the wall I'm on.<br> Some bread, potatoes, onions.<br> I'll come again.<br> Janina will visit you twice a week.<br> To bring more food,<br> see how you are.<br> Thank you.<br> This is very important.<br> In case of emergency...<br> I mean emergency,<br> go to this address.<br> What do you mean you forgot?<br> What do you think I mean?<br> I forgot, that's what I mean.<br> - You know, you treat me like dirt.<br> - Because you are a dirt.<br> - Pig!

Fire!<br> Come on, get out!<br> The attack was successful.<br> That building...<br> Turn that way!<br> Shoot!<br> Thank you.<br> - I wanted to come earlier, but...<br> - No, thank you.<br> No-one thought<br> they'd hold out so long.<br> I never should've come out. I should<br> have stayed and fought with them.<br> Wladek, stop that. It's over now.<br> Just be proud of them.<br> - My God, did they put up a fight!<br> - Yes.<br> - So did the Germans.<br> - They are in shock!<br> They didn't expect it. Nobody<br> expected it. Jews fighting back.<br> - Who would have thought?<br> - What good did it do?<br> What good?<br> Wladek, I'm surprised with you.<br> They died with dignity.<br> And you know something else?<br> Now the Poles will rise.<br> We are ready.<br> We'll fight too.<br> You'll see.<br> Get your things together.<br> You have to leave.<br> What? What's happened?<br> - I'm on the run.<br> - What's happened?<br> The Gestapo found our weapons.<br> They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.<br> They're bound to find out about this<br> place too. You must get away at once.<br> Where do you want me to go?<br> Look at me, I'm not leaving.<br> - Can I take my chances here?<br> - That's your decision.<br> But when they storm the flat,<br> throw yourself out the window...<br> don't let them get you alive.<br> I have poison on me.<br> They won't get me alive either.<br> Open up!<br> Open the door<br> or we'll call the police!<br> Are you from this flat?<br> You're not registered.<br> It belongs to a friend of mine.
