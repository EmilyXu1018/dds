Could be they<br> can't reach you in this weather.<br> Do you have things for shelter?<br> She says, "Thank you".<br> Does your mother prefer<br> to come on with us to Nelson?<br> She'd rather be boiled alive<br> by natives than go in your tub.<br> You be damn fortuned I don't smack<br> your puppy gob, young missy!<br> Damn lucky!<br> We're all ready now, sir.<br> Mother, watch out!<br> The hens! Are they all right? Here.<br> Look, I'm a very big moth.<br> Will it catch fire?<br> I won't call him Papa.<br> I won't call him anything.<br> I'm not even going to look at him.<br> Are we stopping?<br> Shall we stop?<br> Tai hoa. Me tatari tatou.<br> Me tutatou i konei.<br> We must get on.<br> Hmmm?<br> Miss McGrath? Alisdair Stewart.<br> I've got men here<br> to carry your things.<br> I see you've got a good many boxes.<br> I'd like to know what's in each...<br> Can you hear me?<br> Well, that's good.<br> Yes, that's good.<br> What's in this one?<br> You're small.<br> I never thought you'd be small.<br> And this one? This is very large.<br> - What's in it, then, a bedstead?<br> - It's my mother's piano.<br> Tell them to carry in pairs.<br> Take all the boxes, table and...<br> suitcases.<br> What do you think?<br> She looks tired.<br> She's stunted, that's one thing.<br> And the big case?<br> No, no. Just the trunks<br> and the boxes as I explained.<br> - No, it can't come now.<br> - It must. She wants it to come.<br> So do I. But there are too few<br> of us here to carry it now.<br> Too heavy!<br> What, you mean you don't want your<br> clothing or kitchenware to come?<br> We can't leave the piano!<br> Let's not discuss this any further.<br> I'm pleased you arrived safely.<br> Can they come back directly for it?<br> Could I apologise for the delay...<br> After they've taken<br> the other things.<br> Might I suggest that you prepare<br> yourself for a difficult journey.<br> The bush will tear clothing, and<br> the mud is very deep in places.<br> What do they think they're doing?<br> We haven't time for this. Baines!<br> What's the matter?<br> Why are they stopping?<br> That's the way to the<br> burial grounds. It's tapu.<br> They just want more money. They're<br> trying to make two days out of it.<br> No.<br> No, they know another track<br> to the side of this.<br> Septimus, now take that off!<br> Take that off(!)<br> Watch your feet! Mind your feet!<br> - Septimus! Please stop it!<br> - Stop it!<br> - Stop, please! You'll tear it!<br> - Oh, the tag is broken.<br> Septimus, now stop!<br> You'll tear it. Be careful.<br> Arm down.<br> If you cannot have<br> a ceremony together,<br> you'll have at least<br> a photograph.<br> The lace is most fragile.<br> My real father was<br> a famous German composer.<br> They met when my mother was<br> an opera singer in Luxembourg.<br> Why?<br> I want to be in the photograph.<br> Going to leave the cloth here?<br> No, no. It is just to keep<br> the chair dry.<br> The planks have gotten very greasy.<br> Get in that chair.<br> Pull the tarpaulin off.<br> I am sorry it rained.<br> We have not light enough inside.<br> - The umbrella on this side?<br> - On t'other!<br> Can you take this, please?<br> And sitting...<br> Very still.<br> And where did they get married?<br> In a forest<br> with fairies as bridesmaids...<br> each holding a little elf's hand.<br> No, I tell a lie. In a country<br> church in the mountains.<br> - Which mountains?<br> - The Pyrenees.<br> I've never been there.<br> Mother sang in German, and her<br> voice echoed across the valleys.<br> - Before the accident.<br> - And what happened?<br> My mother and father were singing<br> in the forest and a storm blew up.<br> So passionate was the song<br> that they didn't stop<br> as rain began to fall.<br> Their voices rose for the last bars<br> of the duet, and lightning...<br> came out of the sky and struck my<br> father, who lit up like a torch.<br> And as my father<br> was struck dead...<br> my mother was struck dumb.<br> She never spoke another word.<br> Oh, dear!<br> Not another word?<br> Well, from the shock. Yes.<br> It would be. Terrible.<br> Terrible.<br> Terrible, terrible.<br> Sorry.<br> I have to go away for some days.<br> Some Maori land I'm interested in<br> which I may buy very reasonably.<br> I hope you'll spend the time<br> to get settled in. And perhaps...<br> in some ways...<br> ...we could start again.<br> All right?<br> I'm not able to read.<br> Please take us<br> back to the beach where we landed.<br> I am sorry. I can't do that.<br> I don't have the time.<br> Goodbye.<br> I can't take you there.<br> I can't do it.<br> Whoa, whoa!<br> Mumma! Mumma, watch me! Watch!<br> Mumma! Mumma!<br> - Hello, there.<br> - Hello.<br> You've stopped combing your hair.<br> Good. It was looking overdone.<br> The heads will go through<br> the slits.<br> Show him, Nessie.<br> The Reverend will use real blood.<br> It'll be very dramatic.<br> - Very dramatic.<br> - Tea!<br> Morag...<br> what would you think if someone<br> were to play a kitchen table?<br> Like it were a piano.<br> Like it were a piano?<br> Strange, isn't it?<br> I mean, it's not a piano.<br> It doesn't make any sound.<br> Biscuits!<br> No, no sound.<br> I knew she was mute<br> but now I'm thinking...<br> perhaps it's more. I wonder<br> if she's not brain-affected.<br> Shush!<br> - No sound at all?<br> - No. It was a table.<br> She was very violent with the gown.<br> She tore off a chunk of lace.<br> I saw it. I swear she'd have used<br> her teeth and wiped her feet on it.<br> It hasn't come to anything yet.<br> It's simply a concern, that's all.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, of course. A concern.<br> There's something<br> to be said for silence.<br> Indeed. Cotton?<br> With time, I'm sure<br> she'll become affectionate.<br> There's nothing so easy to like<br> as a pet. They're quite silent.<br> ## The grand old Duke of York<br> He had ten thousand men #<br> # He marched them up and up<br> and marched them down again ##<br> Those 80 acres across the stream,<br> what do you think of them?<br> I have no money.<br> What are you on about?<br> I'd like to make a swap.<br> - What for?<br> - The piano.<br> What, the piano on the beach?<br> - It's not marshy, is it?<br> - No.<br> The music lover. I never would have<br> thought. Hidden talents, George!<br> I'd have to get lessons. It<br> wouldn't be much use without them.<br> Yes, I suppose you would.<br> Ada can play. I have it in a letter<br> that she plays very well.<br> She's been playing<br> since she was five or six.<br> What on?<br> Well, on... on your piano.<br> That's the swap.<br> What's she saying?<br> It's her piano<br> and she won't have him touch it!<br> He can't read! He's ignorant!<br> He wants to improve himself,<br> and you'll be able to play it.<br> Teach him how to look after it!<br> You can't go on like this!<br> We're a family now. We all<br> make sacrifices, and so will you!<br> You will teach him,<br> and I will see to it!<br> A Broadwood!<br> A fine instrument!<br> I've not seen one here,<br> nor in New South Wales<br> where I've tuned 200.<br> They like their pianos there.<br> Scent?<br> And salt, of course.<br> Mother says she can't stand<br> to teach piano<br> with it out of tune.<br> So, I'm to do scales.<br> I hope you've scrubbed your hands.<br> It's in tune.<br> It's in tune.<br> I was teaching!<br> Mother would like to see<br> what you can play.<br> I'd rather not play.<br> I want to listen,<br> and learn that way.<br> Everyone has to practise.<br> I just want to listen.<br> Ow!<br> Lovely.<br> Oh, but tell me again.<br> Was he your teacher?<br> How did you speak to him?<br> What happened?<br> Why didn't you get married?<br> Shall I kiss you good night?<br> Get out! You need a bath!<br> Out! Bad dog!<br> Move! Go on!<br> Bad bloody dog!<br> Ada, wait. Wait.<br> Do you know how to bargain?<br> There's a way<br> you could have your piano back.<br> Do you want it back?<br> You want it back?<br> You see...<br> I'd like us to make a deal.<br> There's things I'd...<br> like to do while you play.<br> If you let me,<br> you can earn it back.<br> What do you think?<br> One visit for every key.<br> Your dress?<br> Skirt?<br> For every black one?<br> That's a lot less. Half.<br> All right, all right.<br> Then the black keys.<br> Poor baby!<br> What horrid little person<br> put you in the rain<br> and shoved you with a stick?<br> Hmmm, baby? Huh?<br> You're all right with moi.<br> Scissors.<br> Thank you.<br> Nessie! Put that down<br> and come and put your hand out.<br> Oh, no. Use Mr Stewart.<br> Nessie, please!<br> All right, Mary, come along.<br> Down here.<br> - Come on, girl.<br> - All right, then!<br> Down here. Put out your hand.<br> Now.<br> No, no. Put out your hand. Here.<br> Now.<br> Look, look! You're being attacked.<br> No, there you go.<br> With the blood,<br> it will be a very good effect!<br> Here, Flynn!<br> Flynn, Flynn, Flynn!<br> Flynn, Flynn! Bad boy!<br> Bad, bad boy!<br> Flynn, you want to be in trouble?<br> Flynn? Flynn!<br> I want to speak to my mother.<br> I don't want to be outside.<br> I want to watch.<br> I'll be very quiet!<br> I won't look at him!<br> - Be very careful.<br> - Careful.<br> I hardly need to give one to you,<br> but here you are, anyway.<br> Don't be late.<br> You accompany a performer,<br> and need to make the earlier<br> of the two times.<br> Wait!<br> How are the lessons going?<br> Getting on all right, then, is he?<br> She seems quietened down.<br> Is she more affectionate?<br> Ah, well. Slowly, slowly.<br> Lift your skirt.<br> Lift it higher.<br> Higher.<br> Higher!<br> Lift it higher.<br> You no worry, Peini.<br> - I save you.<br> - I have a wife.<br> I save her, too!<br> - Where's your wife?<br> - My wife?<br> She has a life of her own,<br> in Hull, England.<br> Must be ugly- for you to run away.<br> You need another wife.<br> Undo your dress.<br> I want to see your arms.<br> Play.<br> Two keys.<br> "I shall listen hard at rehearsal<br> because I live too far<br> to come often. "<br> Which sign is the word "rehearsal"?<br> I can't imagine<br> a fate worse than being dumb.<br> To be deaf.<br> Aye. Deaf, too? Terrible! Awful!<br> To tell you the whole truth, mother<br> says most people speak rubbish<br> and it's not worth the listen.<br> Well, that is a strong opinion.<br> Aye. It's unholy.<br> What do they say?<br> Are they selling?<br> Offer blankets for half the land.<br> Twelve.<br> Offer the guns, Baines.<br> What do they want the land for?<br> They don't cultivate it,<br> they don't burn it back. Nothing.<br> I mean, how do they<br> even know that it's theirs?<br> Thought I might as well<br> mark it out as we agreed.<br> Yes, why not?<br> Well, Ada says<br> you're doing well with the piano.<br> I'd like to come and hear you play.<br> - What do you play?<br> - Nothing just yet.<br> No?<br> Ada, four keys.<br> Why five?

Music on sheets and so on.<br> I don't want to learn.<br> - You don't want to learn?<br> - No.<br> But our bargain...<br> I can't afford the piano<br> if you mean me to pay.<br> No, no payment.<br> I have given it back.<br> I'm not sure I want it myself.<br> It was more to your wife<br> that I gave it.<br> Oh...<br> Oh, I see.<br> Well...<br> I expect she will appreciate it.<br> This is all I have.<br> Bring that back!<br> Is it all right?<br> Why don't you play something?<br> What will I play?<br> Play a jig.<br> - Do I know any jigs?<br> - Play a song then.<br> Why won't she play? We get the<br> thing back, she just wanders off.<br> Keep playing.<br> Wait! Wait!<br> Why can't I?<br> I shan't practise and I don't care!<br> Blast and damn! Bugger her!<br> Bloody... bloody... bugger her!<br> Let her fall face down<br> in boiling... bloody... mud!<br> Let a mad dog bite her<br> till she bleeds!<br> - Where's your mother gone?<br> - TO HELL!<br> So, what brings you here?<br> Did you leave something?<br> I've not found anything.<br> Does he know something?<br> The piano was not harmed?<br> It arrived safely?<br> Would you like to sit?<br> I am going to sit.<br> Ada...<br> Ada.<br> I am unhappy...<br> because I... want you...<br> because my mind has seized on you<br> and can think of nothing else.<br> This is why I suffer.<br> I...<br> am sick with longing.<br> I don't eat. I don't sleep.<br> So, if you've come<br> with no feeling for me...<br> then go.<br> Go.<br> Go.<br> Get out.<br> Leave!<br> What?<br> Whisper it.<br> Now you are going I am miserable.<br> Why is that?<br> Ada, I need to know - what will<br> you do? Will you come again?<br> Wait...<br> I don't know what you're thinking.<br> Does this mean something to you?<br> I already miss you.<br> Ada...<br> do you love me?<br> Come tomorrow.<br> If you are serious, come tomorrow.<br> Mumma, stay still!<br> MUMMA! MUMMA!<br> THEY'RE PLAYING YOUR PIANO!<br> Here, Papa.<br> You shouldn't have gone up there.<br> I don't like it, and nor does Papa.<br> We can play cards if you like.<br> She's asleep. Look.<br> One night she was found<br> on the road to London.<br> Grandpa said<br> her feet were cut very badly.<br> Ada.<br> Alisdair, is it<br> because of our play?<br> Have the natives aggressed you?<br> You've done the wrong thing here.<br> You've put the latch<br> on the outside.<br> Now when you close the door,<br> it will be the Maoris<br> that lock you in.<br> With the latch on that side,<br> you are quite trapped.<br> Quite trapped.<br> George Baines has been taken over.<br> No wonder he is leaving.<br> He got in too deep<br> with the natives.<br> - They sit as proud as kings...<br> - ... but without any manners!<br> He's quite altered. As if<br> they've tried witchcraft on him.<br> - Well, in two days he'll be gone.<br> - So Baines is packing up?<br> He's nothing to pack, but he's<br> leaving. And it is just as well.<br> Nessie has foolishly<br> grown fond of him.<br> - We have had tears.<br> Stop it! Stop!<br> STOP!<br> I am frightened of the way back.<br> We must leave in good light.<br> Will we be safe?<br> Oh, yes - if you leave now.<br> Nessie, hold this.<br> I am thinking of the piano.<br> She does not play it<br> as we do, Nessie. Up! Up!<br> No. She is a strange creature.<br> And her playing is strange...<br> like a mood that passes into you.<br> Up!<br> Now, your playing is plain and true<br> and that is what I like.<br> To have a sound creep<br> inside you is not pleasant.<br> What's that?<br> It's a pigeon.<br> I should have waited.<br> I want to touch you.<br> Why can't I touch you?<br> Don't you like me?<br> Come on, Lucky! Who'll be<br> my friend? I'm coming to get you!<br> We must... get on.<br> I've decided to...<br> trust you to stay here.<br> You won't see Baines?<br> Good.<br> Good.<br> Perhaps with time...<br> you might come to like me.<br> Stop complaining, I said. Be quiet.<br> You can stay naked until<br> I finish washing your clothes.<br> I don't mind if you're cold.<br> Be quiet!<br> No, we're not supposed<br> to visit him.<br> What?!<br> The grand old Duke of York<br> He had ten thousand men<br> He marched them up<br> to the top of the hill<br> And marched them down again<br> And when they're up, they're up<br> And when they're down, they're down<br> And when they're only halfway up<br> They're neither up nor down<br> Crooked, Mister Tewart.<br> Crooked.<br> Mother said to give this<br> to Mr Baines.<br> I thought maybe it was not<br> the proper thing to do.<br> - Shall I open it?<br> - No. Give it to me.<br> Why? I trusted you!<br> I TRUSTED YOU! I TRUSTED YOU!<br> D'YOU HEAR?!<br> Why do you make me hurt you?!<br> We could be happy.<br> YOU MAKE ME ANGRY! SPEAK!<br> YOU LIED TO ME!<br> SPEAK! OR, BY GOD,<br> YOU WILL ANSWER FOR THIS!<br> DO YOU LOVE HIM?!<br> DO YOU?!<br> - IS IT HIM YOU LOVE?!<br> - SHE SAYS... NO!<br> MOTHER!<br> Mumma!<br> Give this to Baines.<br> Tell him if he ever sees her again,<br> I'll take off another...<br> and another and another...<br> - Mumma!<br> - RUN!<br> What has happened?<br> Hush, hush!<br> What is it?<br> If you see her, he'll chop her up!<br> What happened? Tell me.<br> TELL ME!<br> Where is she?<br> Ssh! Quiet down! Where is she?!<br> HE CHOPPED IT OFF!<br> What did she tell him?<br> What did she tell him?<br> - I am going to crush his skull!<br> - NO! NO! NO!<br> He'll chop them off!<br> You pushed me too hard.<br> You cannot send love to him.<br> Just even... even to think<br> about it makes me very angry.<br> I meant to love you.<br> I clipped your wing, that's all.<br> We will be together<br> You will see it will be better<br> Are you hot? My sweet love bird.<br> Are you feeling better?<br> What?<br> Look at you.<br> It's your face.<br> I've had that face in my head -<br> hating it.<br> But now I'm here seeing it -<br> it's nothing.<br> You have your marks.<br> You look at me through your eyes.<br> You're even afraid of me.<br> Get up.<br> Baines,<br> has Ada ever spoken to you?<br> You mean in signs?<br> No. Words.<br> Have you ever heard words?<br> No. Not words.<br> You never thought you heard words?<br> I heard it here. I heard her voice.<br> There in my head.<br> The lips didn't make the words.<br> But, yet, the harder I<br> listened... the clearer I heard her.<br> You punished her wrongly.<br> It was me - my fault.<br> She said...<br> "I am afraid of my will -<br> of what it might do.<br> It is so strange and strong. "<br> She said...<br> "I have to go. Let me go. "<br> "Let Baines take me away.<br> Let him try and save me. "<br> I wish her gone. I wish you gone.<br> I want to wake up...<br> and find that this...<br> was all a dream.<br> That's what I want.<br> It was a terrible shock.<br> Oh, dear!<br> No. She needs it. She must have it.<br> - What did she say?<br> - To throw the piano overboard.<br> It's quite safe. They are managing.<br> She doesn't want it.<br> She says it's spoiled!<br> Here's the key.<br> I'll have it mended.<br> Please, Ada. Ada!<br> You'll regret it.<br> It's your piano, you must have it.<br> - She doesn't want it!<br> - Sit down!<br> - Throw it over!<br> - Stop!<br> All right, we'll throw it over.<br> "What a death."<br> "What a chance."<br> "What a surprise!"<br> "My will has chosen life."<br> "Still, it has had me spooked,<br> and many others besides."<br> "I teach piano now in Nelson."<br> "George made me a metal fingertip."<br> "I'm quite the town freak,<br> which satisfies."<br> "I am learning to speak."<br> "My sound is still so bad<br> I feel ashamed."<br> "I practise only<br> when I am alone and it is dark."<br> ...kah, kah, kah,<br> vah, vah, vah,<br> bah, bah, bah,<br> pah, pah.<br> "At night I think of my piano<br> in its ocean grave<br> and sometimes of myself<br> floating above it."<br> "Down there everything is so still<br> and silent, it lulls me to sleep."<br> "It is a weird lullaby,<br> and so it is..."<br> "It is mine."<br> "There is a silence<br> where hath been no sound"<br> "There is a silence<br> where no sound may be"<br> "In the cold grave,<br> under the deep deep sea."<br>
