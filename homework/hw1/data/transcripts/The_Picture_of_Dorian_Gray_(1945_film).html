                        Lord Henry Wotton had set himself early<br> in life to the serious study<br> of the great aristocratic art<br> of doing absolutely nothing.<br> He lived only for pleasure,<br> but his greatest pleasure was to observe<br> the emotions of his friends<br> while experiencing none of his own.<br> He diverted himself by exercising<br> a subtle influence on the lives of others.<br> Eighteen, I think you said, sir.<br> -Shall I wait, sir?<br> -Yes.<br> Among Lord Henry's friends<br> was the painter Basil Hallward.<br> He had been strangely secretive<br> about his latest painting,<br> and Lord Henry, sensing a mystery,<br> determined to discover what it was<br> that his friend wished to conceal.<br> I'm sorry, my lord,<br> Mr. Hallward is not at home.<br> Mr. Hallward doesn't wish to be disturbed.<br> It's your best work, Basil.<br> The best thing you've ever done.<br> Of course, I can't believe that anyone<br> is really as handsome as that portrait.<br> Who is he? What's his name?<br> Why are you being so secretive about it?<br> It's a great painting.<br> You ought to send it to the Grosvenor<br> and let everyone admire it.<br> -I shall not send it anywhere.<br> -But why?<br> I've put too much of myself into it.<br> I knew you'd laugh,<br> but it's true all the same.<br> Well, there certainly isn't any resemblance<br> between you and this young Adonis.<br> You have an intellectual expression,<br> and intellect destroys<br> the beauty of any face.<br> Don't flatter yourself, Basil.<br> You're not in the least like him.<br> Of course I'm not like him.<br> And I'm glad of it.<br> "The Wisdom of Buddha."<br> You always did have a<br> passion for virtue, Basil.<br> Why are you glad you're not like him?<br> We suffer for what the gods give us,<br> and I'm afraid Dorian Gray<br> will pay for his good looks.<br> -Dorian Gray. Is that his name?<br> -Yes. I didn't intend to tell it to you.<br> lf I'm going to keep on visiting you,<br> I'll have to send you some good sherry.<br> Why didn't you intend to tell me his name?<br> I can't explain. As I've grown older,<br> I've come to love secrecy.<br> I suppose that sounds foolish to you.<br> Come into the garden.<br> It doesn't sound foolish to me at all.<br> You forget that I am married<br> and that the one charm of marriage<br> is that it makes a life of deception<br> absolutely necessary to both parties.<br> I believe you are really<br> a very good husband, Harry,<br> but that you are thoroughly ashamed<br> of your own virtues.<br> -Your cynicism is simply a pose.<br> -Being natural is simply a pose<br> and the most irritating pose I know.<br> But you haven't answered my question.<br> I want to know the real reason why<br> you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture.<br> There is really very little to tell, Harry.<br> Besides, I'm afraid<br> you will hardly believe it.<br> I can believe anything<br> provided that it is quite incredible.<br> I'm afraid this will seem so.<br> There is something<br> I can't quite understand.<br> -Something mystic about it.<br> -Mystic?<br> I don't know how to explain it,<br> but whenever Dorian poses for me,<br> it seems as if a power outside myself<br> were guiding my hand.<br> It's as if the painting had a life of its own,<br> independent of me.<br> That's why I'm not going to exhibit it.<br> It belongs rightfully to Dorian Gray,<br> and I shall give it to him.<br> I want to meet<br> this extraordinary young man.<br> I think we shall be friends.<br> I always choose my friends<br> for their good looks<br> and my enemies for their good intellects.<br> A man cannot be too careful<br> in his choice of enemies.<br> Harry, I despise your principles,<br> but I do enjoy the way you express them.<br> I like persons better than principles,<br> and persons with no principles<br> better than anything else in the world.<br> -Now I remember.<br> -Remember what, Harry?<br> -Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.<br> -Where was it?<br> Well, don't look so startled.<br> It was at my Aunt Agatha's.<br> My aunt told me that she had discovered<br> a wonderful young man<br> who was going to help her<br> with her charities<br> and that his name was Dorian Gray.<br> I pictured somebody with spectacles<br> and lank hair tramping about on huge feet,<br> and so I avoided meeting him.<br> That's a very common type<br> of butterfly, Basil.<br> Limenitis sibylla.<br> It hardly belongs in a gentleman's garden.<br> -I'm glad you didn't meet Dorian Gray.<br> -Why?<br> I don't want you to meet him.<br> Who's that at your piano, Basil?<br> -You've come early today, Dorian.<br> -Have I?<br> You must lend me these pieces, Basil.<br> I want to learn them.<br> That depends on<br> how you sit this afternoon.<br> But I thought the picture<br> was going to be finished today.<br> It will be.<br> Please go on, Mr. Gray.<br> You play brilliantly.<br> This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian.<br> An old Oxford friend of mine.<br> My aunt has spoken<br> to me about you, Mr. Gray.<br> You are one of her favorites<br> and one of her victims, too.<br> You shouldn't go in<br> for philanthropy.<br> Harry, I want to finish<br> this picture today.<br> Would you think it rude of me<br> if I asked you to go away?<br> Am I to go, Mr. Gray?<br> Stay and tell me why<br> I should not go in for philanthropy.<br> You don't really mind,<br> do you, Basil?<br> You've often told me that you liked<br> your sitters to have someone to chat to.<br> Sit down then, Harry.<br> Now, Dorian,<br> get up on the platform,<br> and don't pay any attention<br> to what Lord Henry says.<br> He has a bad influence over his friends,<br> with the single exception of myself.<br> Have you really<br> a bad influence, Lord Henry?<br> There's no such thing<br> as a good influence, Mr. Gray.<br> -All influence is immoral.<br> -Why?<br> Because the aim of life<br> is self-development.<br> To realize one's nature perfectly.<br> That's what we're here for.<br> A man should live out his life<br> fully and completely,<br> give form to every feeling,<br> expression to every thought,<br> reality to every dream.<br> Every impulse that we suppress<br> broods in the mind and poisons us.<br> There's only one way to get rid<br> of a temptation and that's to yield to it.<br> Resist it and the soul grows sick<br> with longing for the things<br> it has forbidden to itself.<br> There is nothing that can cure the soul<br> but the senses.<br> Just as there is nothing that can cure<br> the senses but the soul.<br> Turn your head a little more<br> to the left, Dorian.<br> The gods have been<br> good to you, Mr. Gray.<br> Why do you say that?<br> Because you have<br> the most marvelous youth,<br> and youth is the one thing<br> worth having.<br> I don't feel that,<br> Lord Henry.<br> No, you don't feel it now.<br> But some day you'll feel it terribly.<br> What the gods give,<br> they quickly take away.<br> Time is jealous of you, Mr. Gray.<br> Don't squander the gold of your days.<br> Live. Let nothing be lost upon you.<br> Be afraid of nothing.<br> There is such a little time<br> that your youth will last,<br> and you can never get it back.<br> As we grow older,<br> our memories are haunted<br> by the exquisite temptations<br> we hadn't the courage to yield to.<br> The world is yours for a season.<br> It would be tragic if you realized too late,<br> as so many others do,<br> that there is only one thing in the world<br> worth having, and that is youth.<br> Dorian Gray had never heard<br> the praise of folly so eloquently expressed.<br> The creed of pleasure<br> soared into a philosophy of life,<br> while Dorian stood as if<br> he were under a spell.<br> He felt afraid of Lord Henry's ideas<br> and ashamed of himself for being afraid.<br> It was as if he were learning<br> to know himself for the first time,<br> as if a stranger had revealed<br> his own most secret thoughts to him.<br> For the first time he became<br> conscious of his youth,<br> and conscious of the fact that one day<br> he would lose it.<br> My visit to you hasn't been wasted, Basil.<br> I've found a rare and<br> beautiful butterfly, Euvanesse antiope.<br> It's very unusual in England.<br> Don't you think it's beautiful, Mr. Gray?<br> -Yes, Lord Henry, very beautiful.<br> -You may sit down now, Dorian.<br> I'm glad you met Lord Henry, after all.<br> -Are you glad, Mr. Gray?<br> -I'm glad now.<br> -I wonder if I shall always be glad.<br> -Always?<br> That's a dreadful word.<br> It makes me shudder to hear it.<br> Women are so fond of using it.<br> They spoil every romance<br> by trying to make it last forever.<br> The only difference between a caprice<br> and a life-long passion is that<br> the caprice lasts a little longer.<br> But I believe our hostess has appeared.<br> You're just in time, darling,<br> to witness my signature<br> to Dorian's painting.<br> Could I sign it, too?<br> Well, I think you're entitled to.<br> Since you haven't missed a sitting.<br> Here.<br> "G" for Gladys.<br> Which do you prefer, Gladys,<br> Dorian Gray or his picture?<br> I like Dorian best.<br> You prefer him today, my dear,<br> but when you are a young lady<br> and are turning all the handsome heads<br> in London, you may prefer the portrait.<br> For it will look just as it does today,<br> but we shall all be changed.<br> And not for the better.<br> Your uncle and I and even Dorian.<br> Dorian won't change.<br> Dorian will stay just as he is<br> until I'm grown. Won't you, Dorian?<br> Of course I shall, darling.<br> You may say goodbye now, precious.<br> Nanny's waiting. Come along. Hurry.<br> On your way.<br> What about me, young lady,<br> has Dorian Gray<br> stolen you from me completely?<br> Goodbye, Lord Henry.<br> When this is known I shall be torn to<br> shreds in every drawing room in London.<br> Don't you think a gentleman<br> should remove his hat<br> in the presence of a lady, Parker?<br> I never take off my hat<br> except when I'm out of doors.<br> She'll be as lovely<br> as your sister was, Basil.<br> Yes. But I'm afraid Dorian has stolen<br> her heart from me, too.<br> I must congratulate you, Basil.<br> Look at yourself, Mr. Gray.<br> As I grow old,<br> this picture will remain always young.<br> lf it were only the other way.<br> lf it were I who was always to be young,<br> and the picture that was to grow old.<br> You would hardly care<br> for such an arrangement, Basil.<br> It would be rather hard lines on your work.<br> -I should object strongly, Harry.<br> -You oughtn't to express such a wish<br> in the presence of that cat, Dorian.<br> It's one of the seventy-three<br> great gods of Egypt,<br> and is quite capable of granting your wish.<br> Lord Henry is right.<br> I know now that when one loses<br> one's youth, one loses everything.<br> Perhaps a cup of tea<br> will bring you around, Dorian.<br> You'll have some, too, won't you, Harry?<br> Or do you object<br> to such simple pleasures?<br> I adore simple pleasures.<br> They're the last refuge of the complex.<br> It's more than a painting.<br> It's part of myself.<br> As soon as you're varnished and framed,<br> Dorian, you will be sent home.<br> Then you can do<br> whatever you like with yourself.<br> You better send along the Egyptian cat.<br> I don't think the god and the picture<br> should be separated.<br> I will, if Dorian wants it.<br> lf only the picture could change,<br> and I could be always what I am now.<br> For that I would give everything.<br> Yes, there's nothing in the whole world<br> I would not give.<br> I would give my soul for that.<br> Dorian began to venture alone<br> on warm summer evenings<br> into surroundings<br> which were strange to him.<br> Filled with curiosity about places and<br> people remote from his own experience,<br> he wandered to the half-world of London,<br> the words of Lord Henry<br> vibrating in his mind.<br> "Live! Let nothing be lost upon you.<br> Be afraid of nothing!"<br> The Two Turtles is honored<br> by the visit of a gentleman.<br> lf you please, sir.<br> I give you the sweetheart<br> of the Two Turtles.<br> Our own Sibyl Vane!<br> I'd gladly introduce you, sir,<br> but she's proud.<br> She won't meet anybody.<br> Come, my delightful dove.<br> Descend and make a pilgrimage<br> with me among these mortals.<br> She's taken with you, sir.<br> Say the word and I'll take you backstage.<br> Thank you, no.<br> Night after night Dorian went<br> to the Two Turtles to watch Sibyl Vane.<br> A patron of the arts, Mrs. Vane.<br> He's come to the Two Turtles<br> each evening for a fortnight.<br> He wants to tell you<br> how much he admires your daughter.<br> lf you will permit me,<br> I have a request to make.<br> You're very kind, sir.<br> Miss Vane, will you sing<br> The Little Yellow Bird for me now?<br> She will, sir, gladly.<br> But there's no one to play for me.<br> Everyone's gone.<br> I think I might manage<br> the accompaniment.<br> -You will, won't you, dearie?<br> -Yes.<br> On one condition.<br> Please.<br> I apologize for my daughter.<br> It's wonderful. Did you write it?<br> Frederic Chopin wrote it<br> for a woman he loved.<br> Her name was George Sand.<br> Someday I'll tell you about them.<br> I should like that.<br> -What did the music mean to you?<br> -I don't know. It is full of emotion.<br> -But it's not happy.<br> -No, it's not happy.<br> Why was he unhappy?<br> Perhaps because he felt<br> his youth slipping away from him.<br> -What an odd thing for you to say.<br> -Why?<br> You are so young.<br> Yes, and you also.<br> What is the music called? Has it a name?<br> A kind of name. It is called Prelude.<br> ls this the way<br> you watch over Sibyl, Mother?<br> You don't understand these things, James.<br> -Your sister...<br> -I wish I wasn't going to Australia at all.<br> I'd chuck up the whole thing<br> if my articles hadn't been signed.<br> I want Sibyl to make a brilliant marriage.<br> Actresses often marry<br> into the upper classes.<br> I almost did myself at one time.<br> Who is this young dandy?<br> What's his name?<br> Oh, I don't know his name, but he's rich.<br> What's his name, Sibyl?<br> How often has he been here?<br> -What are his intentions?<br> -I don't know his intentions.<br> But I do know his name. It is Sir Tristan.<br> You don't even know his name<br> and yet you permitted him to...<br> Your brother's right, Sibyl, you ought<br> not to have permitted such familiarity.<br> He is good. I know it.<br> There is no evil in him.<br> -Did you see his face?<br> -No, but I wish I had,<br> because if he ever does you any wrong,<br> I'll track him down and kill him.<br> Jim ! You're foolish, Jim. Utterly foolish!<br> You talk like one of the melodramas<br> Mother used to act in.<br> That was when acting was understood.<br> I received a great deal of gratifying<br> attention in those days.<br> All I say is watch over Sibyl, Mother.<br> Watch over her while I'm gone.<br> Jim.<br> You're going away tonight.<br> The ship will take you far away<br> over the dark waters.<br> Don't let me remember you<br> angry and troubled.<br> That's better. Can't you read<br> what people are in their faces?<br> You think I'm silly<br> when I call him Sir Tristan.<br> But to me he's like<br> one of King Arthur's knights<br> that we used to read about<br> when we were children,<br> who took the vow of chivalry<br> to battle against all evil-doers.<br> To defend the right and protect all women.<br> To be true in friendship<br> and faithful in love.<br> You can't go wrong with this one, sir.<br> I've never heard a sweeter warbler.<br> Little yellow bird.<br> -Late as usual, Harry.<br> -Please forgive me, Aunt Agatha.<br> Punctuality is the thief of time, Harry says.<br> Victoria, darling, how nice!<br> I love coming to your house, Aunt Agatha.<br> It's one of the few places<br> I'm likely to meet my husband.<br> I'm always dropping it.<br> Mr. Gray has something terribly important<br> to tell you, Harry.<br> We're all dying to learn what it is.<br> I imagine it can wait<br> until luncheon is over.<br> I'm vexed with you, Harry.<br> Why do you try to persuade Mr. Gray<br> to give up the East End?<br> He's a wonderful musician,<br> and they love his playing.<br> -The East End is a very important problem.<br> -Quite so. It's the problem of slavery,<br> and we try to solve it<br> by amusing the slaves.<br> I suspect, Lord Henry,<br> we're interested in the poor<br> in order to amuse ourselves.<br> Especially as we grow older<br> and are unfit for other amusements.<br> Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me<br> how to become young again.<br> Can you remember any great errors that<br> you committed in your early days,<br> -Duchess?<br> -A great many, I fear.<br> Then commit them over again.<br> To regain one's youth,<br> -one has merely to repeat one's follies.<br> -A delightful theory.<br> -A dangerous theory!<br> -One of the great secrets of life.<br> Most people die<br> of a sort of creeping common sense<br> and discover too late that the only things<br> one never regrets are one's mistakes.<br> But surely if one lives for oneself,<br> one pays a terrible price for doing so.<br> Yes, we are overcharged for everything,<br> nowadays.<br> -One has to pay in other ways than money.<br> -What sort of ways, Sir Thomas?<br> I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in...<br> Well, in the consciousness of degradation.<br> No civilized man ever regrets a pleasure<br> and no uncivilized man<br> ever knows what a pleasure is.<br> I know what pleasure is.<br> It's to adore someone.<br> ln that case, I think I can guess what it is<br> you have to tell me that is so important.<br> But adoring someone is certainly<br> better than being adored.<br> Being adored is a nuisance.<br> You will discover, Dorian,<br> that women treat us just as<br> humanity treats its gods.<br> They worship us and keep bothering us<br> to do something for them.<br> Harry, you're incorrigible.<br> You must admit that women give men<br> the very gold of their lives.<br> But they invariably want it back<br> in such small change.<br> Women, as a witty Frenchman put it,<br> inspire us with the desire<br> to do masterpieces<br> and always prevent us<br> from carrying them out.<br> I don't understand you.<br> You seem to know us women<br> awfully well, Lord Henry.<br> I am analyzing women at present.<br> The subject is less difficult<br> than I was led to believe.<br> Women represent<br> the triumph of matter over mind,<br> just as men represent<br> the triumph of mind over morals.<br> These views are horrifying, Lady Agatha.<br> I did not expect to hear<br> the devil's advocate at your table.<br> I apologize for the intelligence<br> of my remarks, Sir Thomas.<br> I'd forgotten that you were<br> a member of parliament.<br> You will forgive me, Lady Agatha,<br> if I leave at once.<br> Before the quail, Sir Thomas?<br> The first quail of the season?<br> I ordered them especially for you.<br> No, surely not<br> before the quail, Sir Thomas.<br> Think with the Liberals<br> and eat with the Tories.<br> lsn't that the rule?<br> Dear me, how men argue.<br> I can never make out<br> what they're talking about.<br> Do sit down, Sir Thomas.<br> Lord Henry's ideas are<br> demoralizing and delightful.<br> They're not to be taken seriously.<br> I confess, I never could<br> resist Lady Agatha's quail.<br> Well, Dorian, what have you to tell me<br> that is so important?<br> From what you said at luncheon,<br> my guess is that you have fallen in love.<br> I'm engaged to be married.<br> Now that we're on our way, Harry,<br> perhaps you'll tell me where we're going.<br> -Grosvenor Square, Number Seven.<br> -It's Dorian we're going to see?<br> Yes, we're going to pick him up and then<br> we're going to see the young woman<br> he's engaged to marry.<br> -Dorian engaged? To whom, Harry?<br> -To an actress in a cheap vaudeville.<br> An actress!<br> With dyed hair and a painted face?<br> Don't run down dyed hair<br> and painted faces, Basil.<br> -There's an extraordinary charm in them.<br> -But surely you can't be serious.<br> -I hope I shall never be more serious.<br> -But you don't approve.<br> -You can't possibly.<br> -I never approve or disapprove of anything.<br> Dorian Gray falls in love<br> with a beautiful girl<br> and proposes to marry her. Why not?<br> Every experience is of value, and<br> whatever can be said against marriage,<br> it's certainly an experience.<br> Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife,<br> and six months later<br> become infatuated with someone else.<br> -You think he could be so unfaithful?<br> -Faithfulness is merely laziness.<br> Number Seven, sir.<br> I've been watching for you.<br> Go to Lower Euston Road, Number 22.<br> Lower Euston Road, sir?<br> -Lower Euston Road.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> They're always surprised<br> when I give them that address. Hurry.<br> I want you to get there in time<br> to meet her before she sings.<br> I hope you will always be as happy<br> as you are at this moment, Dorian.<br> Thank you, Basil. Of course,<br> our engagement is still a dead secret.<br> -She's not even told her mother.<br> -What will your guardian say of it?<br> Lord Radley is sure to be furious.<br> But there's nothing he can do.<br> May I ask you a question, Dorian?<br> At what particular point<br> did you mention marriage?<br> I didn't make any formal proposal, Harry.<br> I told her I loved her and she said<br> she was not worthy to be my wife.<br> -"Not worthy."<br> -Women are wonderfully practical.<br> ln situations of that kind,<br> we often forget to say<br> anything about marriage,<br> and they always remind us.<br> Sibyl has made me forget<br> your poisonous theories, Harry.<br> -Which theories, Dorian?<br> -Your theories about life, about pleasure.<br> Pleasure is the only thing<br> worth having a theory about.<br> It's nature's sign of approval.<br> When we're happy, we're always good.<br> When we're good, we're not always happy.<br> Sibyl is the answer<br> to all your cynicism, Harry.<br> I believe you'll understand that<br> when you see her.<br> This marriage is quite right.<br> I didn't think so at first,<br> but the moment we met her,<br> I was convinced of it.<br> She's charming and innocent,<br> transparently so.<br> -I knew you would say that.<br> -She's all that you say.<br> But I don't agree with Basil.<br> I believe she loves you so much<br> you have no need to marry her.<br> What wickedness<br> are you contemplating now?<br> I ought to be angry with you, Harry,<br> but I'm much too happy.<br> All I know is that Sibyl is sacred to me.<br> It's only the sacred things<br> that are worth touching.<br> I begin to find you disgusting.<br> Don't listen to him, Dorian.<br> Don't worry, Basil.<br> I'm immune to his ideas now.<br> ln that case, I needn't tell you how<br> I should proceed if I were in your place.<br> What would you do, Harry?<br> I'm curious to know.<br> Well, I should invite her to come<br> to my house to see Basil's portrait.<br> Then when she said it was time<br> for her to go home,<br> I should ask her not to leave.<br> She'd be shocked, of course.<br> I'd pretend to be disappointed in her.<br> lf she still wished to go,<br> I'd become cold and indifferent.<br> I'd ask her to let herself out,<br> saying that I couldn't bear sad farewells<br> or something equally appropriate.<br> But if after that she left,<br> then I'd believe her to be as good<br> as she is beautiful<br> and I'd beg her forgiveness and marry her.<br> I've always thought<br> your wickedness a pose.<br> I know better now.<br> You're an unmitigated cad.<br> Will you try my experiment, Dorian?<br> Miss Vane. Miss Vane, has Sir Tristan,<br> as you have so charmingly called him,<br> ever invited you to see<br> the wonderful portrait<br> that Basil Hallward has made of him?<br> No, he hasn't. I should love to see it.<br> May I?<br> Of course you may, darling.<br> Tonight, if you wish.<br> I shall always remember this room<br> just as it is now,<br> the lamplight, you at the piano,<br> my own happiness.<br> Your clock thinks<br> it's time for me to go home.<br> Clocks can't help being disagreeable.<br> They think it's their duty.<br> It's that cat. I thought I saw its eyes move.<br> Perhaps you did.<br> Lord Henry says it's one of<br> the 73 great gods of Egypt.<br> -Doesn't it frighten you?<br> -It does a little. Listen to this.<br> "Dawn follows Dawn, and Nights grow old<br> and all the while this curious cat<br> "Lies crouching on the Chinese mat<br> with eyes of satin rimmed with gold.<br> "Get hence, you loathsome mystery!<br> Hideous animal, get hence!<br> "You wake in me each bestial sense,<br> you make me what I would not be.<br> "You make my creed a barren sham,<br> "you wake foul dreams<br> "of sensual life."<br> -What a strange poem. Who wrote it?<br> -A brilliant young lrishman out of Oxford.<br> His name is Oscar Wilde.<br> Why do you look at me so strangely?<br> What would you do, Sibyl,<br> if I should say to you,<br> "Don't leave me now, don't go home?"<br> What would you do, Sibyl?<br> I suppose I should have expected<br> a conventional reaction.<br> -Good night, then.<br> -Good night.<br> You don't mind letting yourself out,<br> do you? I can't bear sad farewells.<br> A wise friend warned me<br> that your innocence,<br> upon which I would have staked my life,<br> would fail to meet the test<br> I set before you.<br> I called his wisdom cynicism,<br> but now I know better.<br> You have killed my love.<br> You have been false, not to me,<br> but to the ideal I had formed of you.<br> You used to stir my imagination.<br> Now you are nothing to me.<br> I will never see you again.<br> I will never mention your name.<br> I will never think of you.<br> Henceforth, I shall live only for pleasure.<br> Everything else is meaningless.<br> And if this leads me<br> to the destruction of my soul,<br> then it is only you who are responsible.<br> Do not try to see me.<br> I shall leave England<br> and not return for a long time.<br> I am sending with this letter<br> a gift of money,<br> which will compensate you<br> for any disappointment you may feel.<br> I have been living in a land of illusions.<br> Now, I shall make an end of dreams.<br> My real life begins.<br> My own life, in which you cannot<br> possibly have any part.<br> Five minutes, Miss Vane.<br> ln spite of himself, Dorian was troubled<br> by what he had done.<br> His uneasy conscience<br> made him avoid those he knew,<br> and all night he had wandered alone<br> through the dimly lit streets<br> and evil-looking houses<br> of the London half-world.<br> When at last he returned to his silent,<br> shuttered house in Mayfair,<br> he could not overcome<br> a sense of something ominous impending.<br> His eye fell on the portrait<br> Basil Hallward had painted of him.<br> ln the dim, shaded light,<br> the face appeared to him<br> to be a little changed.<br> The expression looked somehow different.<br> One would have said that there was<br> a touch of cruelty in the mouth.<br> It was very strange.<br> There was no doubt<br> that the whole expression had altered.<br> The lines of cruelty about the mouth<br> were unmistakable.<br> There was no such expression on his face.<br> lf only the picture could change,<br> and I could be always as I am now.<br> For that I would give everything.<br> Yes, there is nothing in the whole world<br> I would not give.<br> I would give my soul for that.<br> But, surely, his wish had not been fulfilled.<br> Such things were impossible.<br> It was monstrous even to think of it.<br> What if someone else observed the<br> horrible change, his valet, perhaps?<br> What if Basil Hallward came<br> and asked to look at his own picture?<br> But he was being ridiculous.<br> This was a mere hallucination.<br> An illusion<br> brought on by his troubled senses.<br> The picture had not changed.<br> He was mad to think so.<br> A painted canvas could not alter.<br> He would look at it again<br> after he had slept, when he was calmer,<br> and he would laugh at this fantastic idea.<br> But in the afternoon when he returned<br> to examine the portrait again,<br> fantastic as the idea was,<br> his memory of that cruel look<br> was disturbingly vivid.<br> It was true. The expression had altered.<br> There was no doubt of it.<br> It was incredible, and yet it was a fact.<br> Was this portrait to become for him<br> the emblem of his own conscience?<br> Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?<br> But if this painting<br> was to be his conscience made visible,<br> then he would let it instruct him.<br> He would give it no reason<br> to reproach him.<br> He would live purely and nobly.<br> He had been cruel to Sibyl Vane.<br> But it was not too late to make that right.<br> She could still be his wife.<br> He would marry her.<br> They could be happy together.<br> He implored her forgiveness.<br> He blamed himself.<br> He gave way to the luxury of self-reproach.<br> When he finished the letter,<br> he felt that he had been forgiven.<br> Dorian, let me in. I must see you.<br> Open the door, Dorian.<br> I'll not go away until I see you.<br> Dorian, let me in.<br> You shouldn't lock yourself in<br> like this, Dorian.<br> I'm sorry for it all, dreadfully sorry.<br> -You mean about Sibyl Vane?<br> -Yes, of course.<br> It's all right now, Harry.<br> I'm actually grateful to you.<br> I've learned to know myself better.<br> I know you will sneer at me,<br> but from now on,<br> I'm going to do as my conscience bids me.<br> -What on earth are you talking about?<br> -About Sibyl Vane. I'm going to marry her.<br> -Marry her!<br> -I know what you're going to say.<br> Something cynical about marriage.<br> Don't say it.<br> Two weeks ago, I asked Sibyl to marry me.<br> I'm not going to break my word to her.<br> -Then you don't know.<br> -Know what?<br> -Haven't you read the morning papers?<br> -No, I haven't.<br> What is it, Harry? What's happened?<br> Sibyl Vane is dead.<br> That's why I hurried here to see you.<br> I didn't want you<br> to see anyone until I came.<br> When I found<br> that you had locked yourself in,<br> I assumed you knew about it.<br> There'll be an inquest,<br> and you mustn't get mixed up in it.<br> They don't know your name at the theater,<br> I suppose, and if they don't, it's all right.<br> -Did Sibyl... Tell me everything, Harry.<br> -It was obviously not an accident.<br> Though I suppose it must be<br> put that way to the public.<br> Half past twelve or so, she was leaving<br> the theater with her mother,<br> when she said she'd forgotten something,<br> and went back to her dressing room.<br> She didn't come down again.<br> They found her lying on the floor.<br> She'd swallowed something.<br> By mistake, they say.<br> She died instantaneously.<br> It's tragic, of course,<br> but you mustn't let yourself brood over it.<br> You must learn to see it<br> in its proper perspective.<br> For the moment,<br> you must put it out of your mind.<br> You must come and dine with me,<br> and afterwards,<br> we'll look in at the opera.<br> It's Don Giovanni.<br> Everybody'll be there,<br> and you can come to my sister's box.<br> So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,<br> as surely as if I'd cut her throat.<br> I can't see why you should blame yourself.<br> I suppose you had a quarrel,<br> and she foolishly thought she had lost you.<br> But no woman destroys herself<br> who isn't already unbalanced.<br> Where do you keep your sherry?<br> lf you'd married this girl,<br> you would have been wretched,<br> and so in time would she have been.<br> I assure you, the whole thing<br> would have been an absolute failure.<br> I remember your saying once,<br> there's a fatality about good resolutions.<br> They're always made too late.<br> -Mine certainly were.<br> -You should look upon this tragedy<br> as an episode<br> in the wonderful spectacle of life.<br> What is it that has really happened?<br> Someone has killed herself for love of you.<br> I wish that I'd had such an experience.<br> The women who have admired me,<br> and there have been some,<br> have always insisted on living on long<br> after I have ceased to care for them<br> or they to care for me.<br> They've become stout and tedious.<br> And when I meet them,<br> they go in at once for reminiscences.<br> That awful memory of woman.<br> Drink this. It'll make you feel better.<br> I found myself sitting<br> next to such a woman<br> the other night at dinner.<br> She had once proposed to sacrifice<br> the whole world for me.<br> That's always a dreadful moment.<br> It fills one with the terror of eternity.<br> It happened years ago,<br> but she insisted on dragging<br> the whole thing out again,<br> and she assured me<br> that I'd spoiled her life.<br> However, she ate an enormous dinner.<br> Not one of the women I've known<br> would have done for me<br> what Sibyl Vane did for you.<br> But you haven't told me yet whether<br> you will dine with me tonight.<br> I don't feel up to it, Harry.<br> Then perhaps you'll join me<br> later at the opera.<br> My sister's box number is 27.<br> It's on the Grand Tier.<br> You'll see her name on the door.<br> I hope to see you before half past nine.<br> I don't want you to miss<br> de Reszke in the duet.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Hallward. Mr. Gray isn't in.<br> He's gone to the opera.<br> -To the opera?<br> -Yes, sir. Is there any message, sir?<br> No. No, I'll come by in the morning.<br> But in the morning,<br> Dorian no longer wanted<br> the consolation of his friend,<br> nor his reproaches.<br> His pride and his sense of guilt<br> prompted him<br> to assume an air of indifference.<br> Hello, Basil. Sorry to keep you.<br> -Have you had breakfast?<br> -Yes, I have, thank you.<br> I'm famished. You don't mind<br> if I have a bite while we talk?<br> Of course not.<br> You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane<br> was lying dead in some sordid lodging?<br> -What is past is past.<br> -You call yesterday the past?<br> It's only shallow people<br> who require years to get rid of an emotion.<br> A man who is master of himself<br> can end a sorrow as easily<br> as he can invent a pleasure.<br> I don't want to be at the mercy<br> of my emotions.<br> I want to use them,<br> enjoy them, and dominate them.<br> Something has changed you<br> completely, Dorian.<br> You look exactly the same.<br> You talk as if you had<br> no heart, no pity in you.<br> You've come too late.<br> lf you had come in yesterday<br> at a particular moment,<br> about half past five or a quarter to six,<br> you would've seen<br> how deeply I was affected.<br> Even Harry, who brought me the news,<br> had no idea what I was going through.<br> I suffered immensely.<br> Then it passed away.<br> I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can.<br> This isn't you talking, Dorian.<br> These are Harry's ideas.<br> It has nothing to do with Harry.<br> I suppose Harry didn't give you<br> that yellow book I saw on your table.<br> -What's wrong with that book?<br> -Everything.<br> It's vile, evil, corrupt, decadent. I detest it.<br> What would you like me to read, Basil?<br> Since you asked me.<br> -"The Light of Asia."<br> -I'm never without it.<br> -The story of Buddha, isn't it?<br> -The story of Buddha, a good man.<br> -Promise me you'll read it, Dorian.<br> -I promise.<br> You've done a sketch of Sibyl.<br> It's charming. May I have it?<br> Of course. I must go now, Dorian.<br> I'm relieved to find you<br> in such good spirits<br> in spite of what has happened.<br> Thank you, Basil.<br> It's good of you to be so concerned.<br> Before I go, I'd like to look at the painting<br> I did of you.<br> There's a screen in front of it.<br> I thought the room looked different<br> when I came in.<br> -The light was too strong on the portrait.<br> -Surely not. It's an admirable place for it.<br> Wait. You must not look at it.<br> Not look at my own work?<br> You're not serious.<br> -Why shouldn't I look at it?<br> -I don't offer any explanation,<br> and you're not to ask for any,<br> but if you try to look at that picture, Basil,<br> on my word of honor,<br> I will never speak to you again.<br> What on earth is the matter with you?<br> I'm planning to exhibit it next month.<br> -That's why I wanted to look at it.<br> -Exhibit it?<br> But you told me a month ago,<br> you would never exhibit it.<br> You told Harry the same thing.<br> At that time the painting<br> had a strange fascination for me.<br> It seemed almost to have a life of its own.<br> It affected me so much,<br> I felt I couldn't let it be seen publicly.<br> Perhaps you've seen<br> the same mysterious quality in it, Dorian.<br> Have you noticed<br> something curious in the painting?<br> Something that probably<br> at first did not strike you,<br> but that revealed itself to you suddenly?<br> -I see you did.<br> -I saw something in it.<br> Something that seemed<br> to be very curious.<br> You are right. There can be something<br> fatal about a portrait.<br> I think I understand what you feel about it.<br> And I respect your wishes.<br> Perhaps someday you'll recover from it,<br> as I did.<br> At any rate, I'll certainly not let it destroy<br> our friendship.<br> -I'm glad of that.<br> -Goodbye, Dorian.<br> Goodbye, Basil.<br> It had been mad of him to allow<br> the thing to remain, even for an hour,<br> in a room to which<br> any of his friends had access.<br> Henceforth, he must be on his guard<br> against everyone.<br> At the top of the house<br> was his old schoolroom,<br> which had not been used for years.<br> No one ever entered it.<br> Nothing was in it<br> but his old school books and his toys,<br> gathering dust and cobwebs.<br> The picture<br> could be safely hidden away there.<br> He could lock it up.<br> He himself would keep the key.<br> There was no need for the servants<br> ever to enter the room.<br> He would have to let Victor go,<br> and the others.<br> He must bring new servants<br> into the house.<br> ln this room,<br> every moment of his childhood<br> and its stainless purity came back to him.<br> Here among the innocent souvenirs<br> of his childhood,<br> the hideous portrait<br> would be forever hidden away.<br> The face painted in the canvas<br> could grow bestial, sodden and unclean.<br> No one would ever see it.<br> No one, except himself.<br> He was to have eternal youth,<br> while the portrait<br> bore the burden of his shame.<br> He was caught in an evil destiny.<br> As the years passed,<br> the miracle of Dorian's changeless youth<br> caused wonder, but rarely suspicion.<br> Even those who had heard<br> the most evil things against him,<br> the strange rumors about his mode of life,<br> which spread through London<br> and became the chatter of the clubs,<br> could not believe anything<br> to his dishonor when they saw him.<br> He had always the look of one<br> who had kept himself<br> unspotted from the world.<br> But while he fascinated many,<br> there were not a few who distrusted him.<br> Curious stories were current about him.<br> It was rumored<br> that he had been seen in a low den<br> in the distant parts of Whitechapel.<br> His extraordinary absences<br> became notorious,<br> and when he reappeared again in society,<br> men would whisper to each other<br> in corners, or pass him with a sneer,<br> or look at him with cold, searching eyes.<br> Some of those<br> who had been most intimate with him<br> appeared after a time to shun him.<br> Women who, for his sake,<br> had set convention at defiance,<br> were seen to grow pale<br> if Dorian Gray entered the room.<br> He could not endure<br> to be long out of England,<br> or to be separated from the picture,<br> it was such a part of his life.<br> He was afraid that during his absence,<br> someone might gain access to the room<br> where it was hidden.<br> Then suddenly some night<br> he would go down<br> to dreadful places near Bluegate Fields,<br> and stay there, day after day.<br> When he had recovered<br> from these visits to the abyss,<br> he would stand in front of the picture,<br> sometimes loathing it and himself,<br> but filled at other times<br> with that pride of individualism<br> that is half the fascination of evil.<br> He would examine with minute care<br> the hideous lines<br> that scarred the wrinkling forehead,<br> or crawled<br> around the heavy sensual mouth,<br> wondering which were more horrible,<br> the signs of sin or the signs of age.<br> He found reasons to justify his actions.<br> He told himself that man was a being<br> with myriad lives and myriad sensations.<br> To live a simple, sincere,<br> honest life was hardly to live at all.<br> Was insincerity such a terrible thing?<br> Dorian thought not.<br> It was merely a method by which<br> we could multiply our personalities.<br> Yet, there was one person<br> towards whom he found it<br> difficult to be insincere.<br> It was Basil Hallward's niece, Gladys,<br> who had loved him since she was a child.<br> I was close by and came in for a moment.<br> I found this old song in your piano bench.<br> It's charming.<br> So is the face<br> that my uncle sketched on it.<br> He did do it, didn't he?<br> I know his style so well.<br> Did she sing this song? Who is she?<br> Do tell me about her.<br> She died many years ago,<br> when you were only a little girl.<br> Did you love her very much, Dorian?<br> Yes.<br> Goodbye, Dorian.<br> I'm looking forward to your party tonight.<br> I'm sure it will be wonderful.<br> Your parties always are.<br> I'm not really as lovely as that picture,<br> am I, darling?<br> Of course not.<br> I think I've discovered<br> why Dorian hasn't proposed to me.<br> And I've decided what to do about it.<br> And what have you decided to do about it?<br> I'm going to ask him<br> to marry me, tonight, perhaps.<br> What about David Stone?<br> Do you think he'd take you<br> to Dorian's party tonight<br> -if he knew what your intentions were?<br> -Of course he would.<br> Nothing petty about David,<br> but I don't intend to tell him.<br> -No, don't tell David.<br> -David, you cad.<br> I never thought you'd be an eavesdropper.<br> Don't be alarmed about Dorian Gray,<br> Mr. Hallward.<br> I'm the one Gladys will marry.<br> Of course, I have nothing to say about it.<br> Even if you weren't going to marry me,<br> I wouldn't let you marry that devil.<br> I'll not have you say anything<br> against him, David.<br> I don't have to.<br> There are plenty of others to say it for me.<br> Lies and jealousy, all of it.<br> There is no evil in Dorian.<br> Anybody can see that by looking at him.<br> Well, he hasn't asked you yet.<br> I'll say that for him.<br> You heard what I said.<br> I'm going to ask him myself, tonight.<br> -In front of all those people, I suppose.<br> -I'll get him alone. It's a big house.<br> -Good night, sir.<br> -Good night, David.<br> What's wrong, Dorian?<br> Why don't you answer me?<br> ls there something else?<br> Something I don't know about?<br> You must have heard the stories<br> they tell of me.<br> -Don't they frighten you?<br> -I don't believe them.<br> Suppose I were to tell you<br> that they're true.<br> I will never believe anything evil of you.<br> What do you know of evil?<br> I only know there is none in you.<br> lf you had some great trouble, Dorian,<br> I would want to share it.<br> lf I were to marry you,<br> it would be an incredible wickedness.<br> ls that a way of saying you don't love me?<br> lf you like.<br> It's very beautiful, Dorian. Thank you.<br> Would you find David for me?<br> I must go now.<br> I've been exploring your house, Dorian.<br> You don't mind, do you?<br> It's better than a museum.<br> I see.<br> You must have<br> some priceless possessions in that room<br> if you keep them locked up.<br> May I see them sometime?<br> What rare things have you<br> stored away there, Dorian?<br> Skeletons of inquisitive guests.<br> -I suspected as much.<br> -I want to leave now, David.<br> -Of course.<br> -Good night, Dorian.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> Good night.<br> It was the ninth of November,<br> the eve of his own 38th birthday,<br> as Dorian often remembered afterwards.<br> He was walking home about 11.'oo<br> from Lord Henry's,<br> where he had been dining.<br> A strange sense of fear<br> for which he could not account<br> came over him<br> at the sight of Basil Hallward<br> and prevented him<br> from making any sign of recognition.<br> Dorian!<br> I thought it was you<br> or your fur coat, but I wasn't sure.<br> -Didn't you recognize me?<br> -In this fog?<br> I can't even recognize Grosvenor Square.<br> I think my house is somewhere about here<br> but I'm not certain of it.<br> I've been waiting for you<br> in your library ever since 9:00.<br> Finally, I took pity on your man<br> and told him to go to bed.<br> I'm off to Paris on the midnight train,<br> and I particularly wanted to see you<br> before I left.<br> It's a bit of luck, running into you like this.<br> I'm sorry you're going away.<br> I haven't seen you in ages.<br> I suppose you'll be back soon.<br> No. I shall be out of England<br> for several months.<br> I'm going to take a studio in Paris<br> and shut myself up<br> until I finish a picture I have in my head.<br> Gladys is coming over to join me later on.<br> May I come in for a moment?<br> Won't you miss your train?<br> It doesn't leave until 12:15,<br> and it's only just 11:00.<br> As a matter of fact, I was on my way<br> to the club to look for you.<br> There won't be any delay<br> about my luggage,<br> as I've sent on my heavy things.<br> All I have with me is in this bag.<br> Come in, or the fog will get into the house.<br> I hope you're not going to talk<br> about anything serious.<br> Nothing is serious nowadays.<br> At least nothing should be.<br> What I have to say to you<br> is serious, Dorian.<br> Don't frown like that.<br> You make it so much more difficult for me.<br> I hope it's not about myself.<br> I'm tired of myself.<br> It is about yourself<br> and I must say it to you.<br> -I'll only keep you half an hour.<br> -You sound terrifying, Basil.<br> It's for your sake I'm speaking.<br> I think you should know the things<br> that are being said against you in London.<br> I don't want to know them.<br> I love scandals about other people,<br> but scandals about myself<br> don't interest me. They lack novelty.<br> You must be interested<br> in your own reputation.<br> Mind you, I don't believe these rumors.<br> I can't believe them when I see you.<br> There aren't any secret vices.<br> Such things write themselves<br> across a man's face.<br> You, with your untroubled youth,<br> I find it hard<br> to credit anything against you.<br> When I hear all these hideous things<br> that people whisper about you,<br> I don't know what to say.<br> I absolve you from the necessity<br> of defending me,<br> if that's what's troubling you.<br> You can't dismiss these charges so lightly.<br> Why does a man like the Duke of Harwick<br> leave the room of a club<br> when you enter it?<br> Not because he knows anything<br> about my life, Basil,<br> but because I know everything about his.<br> But why are your friendships<br> so fatal to people?<br> There was that wretched boy<br> in the Guards who committed suicide.<br> What about Adrian Singleton<br> and Lord Wayne's son?<br> What gentleman will be seen<br> with either of them?<br> The wretched boy in the Guards<br> was so insanely in love with a woman<br> he felt he couldn't live without her.<br> Am I to blame for that?<br> Wayne's silly son marries a woman<br> no one will receive. Is that my fault?<br> Adrian Singleton writes<br> his friend's name across a bill.<br> Am I his keeper?<br> Still, one has a right to judge a man<br> by the effect he has on his friends.<br> Yours seem filled<br> with an insatiable madness for pleasure.<br> And when I think<br> of how fond Gladys is of you...<br> -What has Gladys to do with this?<br> -Nothing, I hope.<br> And nothing in the future,<br> if I can prevent it.<br> I'm told things it seems<br> impossible to doubt.<br> Lord Wallace<br> was one of my greatest friends at Oxford.<br> He showed me a letter that his wife<br> had written when she was dying, alone,<br> in her villa at Montone.<br> Your name was implicated<br> in the most terrible confession I ever read.<br> I told him it was absurd,<br> that I knew you, and that you were<br> incapable of anything of the kind.<br> "Know." Do I know you?<br> Before I could answer that,<br> I should have to see your soul.<br> -To see my soul?<br> -Yes. To see your soul.<br> But only God can do that.<br> You shall see it yourself, tonight.<br> Why shouldn't you look at it?<br> It's your own handiwork.<br> You can tell the world all about it<br> afterward if you like.<br> No one will believe you.<br> You've chatted enough about corruption.<br> Now, you'll look at it.<br> I'll show you my soul.<br> I can make no sense<br> out of what you're saying, Dorian.<br> I only ask you to give me some answer<br> to the horrible charges<br> that are made against you.<br> Tell me they aren't true<br> from beginning to end, and I'll believe you.<br> Come upstairs, Basil.<br> I keep a diary of my life from day to day.<br> It never leaves the room<br> in which it is written.<br> I'll show it to you.<br> I don't want to read anything. All I want<br> is a plain answer to my question.<br> You'll find that upstairs.<br> You won't have to read long.<br> You are the one man in the world who's<br> entitled to know everything about me.<br> You have had more to do with my life<br> than you think.<br> You think it's only God who sees the soul.<br> ln spite of the indescribable<br> corruption of the portrait,<br> Basil was still able<br> to recognize his painting of Dorian.<br> It was from within, apparently,<br> that the foulness and horror came.<br> It was as if some moral leprosy<br> were eating the thing away.<br> He could not believe<br> that he had made this portrait,<br> yet there was his own name<br> just as he had painted it.<br> This is monstrous.<br> It's beyond nature, beyond reason.<br> What does it mean?<br> On the day you finished this painting,<br> I made a wish.<br> Perhaps you would call it a prayer.<br> My wish was granted.<br> But you told me<br> you had destroyed my painting.<br> -I was wrong. It has destroyed me.<br> -It has the eyes of the devil.<br> Each of us has heaven and hell in him.<br> But if this is true, if this is<br> what you have done with your life,<br> it is far worse than anything<br> that's been said of you.<br> Do you know how to pray, Dorian?<br> What is it we were<br> taught to say in our boyhood?<br> "Lead us not into temptation.<br> Forgive us our sins.<br> "Wash away our iniquities."<br> Let us say them together.<br> -It's too late, Basil.<br> -The prayer of your pride was answered.<br> The prayer of your repentance<br> may be answered, also.<br> Do you think I haven't tried?<br> I tell you, it's no use.<br> lsn't there a verse somewhere?<br> "Though your sins be as scarlet,<br> yet I will make them white as snow."<br> Only last week, Gladys recalled the day<br> this painting was finished.<br> She remembered putting<br> her initial under my signature.<br> There it is, just as she made it.<br> lf she could see it now.<br> I can still pray, Dorian, if you can't.<br> Gladys must never know.<br> Yet sometime, somehow,<br> Basil might reveal his secret to her.<br> The one person in the world<br> whose good opinion<br> was indispensable to him.<br> An uncontrollable feeling of hatred<br> for Basil came over him,<br> together with a terror of the knowledge<br> he had given him<br> and the use he might make of it.<br> Panic seized him.<br> He felt like a hunted animal,<br> cornered, desperate.<br> It was as if the painting had sweated<br> a dew of blood.<br> He felt that he had struck a mortal blow,<br> not only at his friend but at himself.<br> It seemed to him unbearable<br> that what he had done<br> could never be undone.<br> Basil was dead.<br> Men were strangled in England<br> for what he had done.<br> And yet what evidence<br> was there against him?<br> Basil had left the house at 11.'oo.<br> No one had seen him come in again.<br> Most of the servants were at Selby.<br> His valet had gone to bed.<br> Paris.<br> It was to Paris that Basil had gone<br> by the midnight train as he had intended.<br> I'm sorry to wake you, Francis.<br> I forgot my latchkey.<br> What time is it?<br> -Half past twelve, sir.<br> -Half past twelve.<br> You must wake me at 9:00 in the morning.<br> I have some work to do.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Did anyone call this evening?<br> Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed till 11:00<br> and then he went to catch his train.<br> He said he was leaving for Paris.<br> I'm sorry I didn't see him.<br> Did he leave any message?<br> He said he would write you from Paris<br> if he didn't find you at your club.<br> -Thank you, Francis.<br> -Is there anything more, sir?<br> I'm going to write a letter.<br> I'd like you to deliver it<br> by hand early in the morning.<br> Mr. Allen Campbell.<br> You'll find the address on the envelope.<br> Yes, sir. Good night, sir.<br> ln the morning, when Allen Campbell<br> received his letter, he would come.<br> He would come at once.<br> Allen would help him. He was the only one<br> who could help him now.<br> But what if Allen Campbell<br> should be out of England?<br> Days would pass<br> before he could come back.<br> Perhaps he would refuse to come.<br> Mr. Allen Campbell, sir.<br> This is kind of you, Allen.<br> -You said it was a matter of life and death.<br> -Listen to this.<br> "I sent my soul through the invisible,<br> "Some letter of that after-life to spell:<br> And by and by my soul returned to me,<br> "And answered,<br> 'I myself am heaven and hell."'<br> That's quite good, don't you think?<br> I didn't come here to discuss<br> the verses of Omar Khayyam.<br> No, of course not. Please sit down, Allen.<br> I'll tell you why I sent for you.<br> Allen, in a locked room<br> at the top of this house,<br> a room to which no one<br> but myself has access,<br> a dead man is lying across a table.<br> He's been dead for 10 hours.<br> Who he is, why he died, how he died,<br> are matters that do not concern you.<br> -What you must do is...<br> -There's no need for you to go on, Dorian.<br> Your horrible secrets don't interest me.<br> They'll have to interest you.<br> You are the one man<br> who is able to save me.<br> You are scientific, Allen.<br> I have seen your name<br> recently in scientific reviews,<br> in connection with certain<br> curious experiments.<br> What has that to do with you?<br> What you have got to do is<br> to destroy the thing that is upstairs.<br> Destroy it so that not a vestige is left.<br> Nobody saw this person<br> come into the house.<br> He is supposed to be in Paris.<br> When he is missed,<br> not a trace of him must be found here.<br> You must change him<br> and everything that belongs to him,<br> including his coat and his traveling bag,<br> which I have locked up in this room,<br> into a handful of ashes.<br> You must be insane<br> to suppose I'd lift a finger to help you.<br> -It was suicide, Allen.<br> -What drove him to it?<br> You won't do this for me?<br> How can you ask me, of all men,<br> to mix myself up in this horror?<br> Allen, it was murder. I killed him.<br> He was responsible for the ruin of my life.<br> He didn't intend it,<br> but the result was the same.<br> You are certain to be caught.<br> No man commits a crime<br> without doing something stupid.<br> -I'll have no part of it.<br> -We were friends once, Allen.<br> I regret that.<br> Don't you understand that<br> if you don't help me, I'm lost?<br> -They will hang me for what I have done.<br> -Let them.<br> -You refuse?<br> -Yes.<br> -I entreat you.<br> -It's useless.<br> I'm sorry, Allen.<br> You leave me no alternative.<br> I've written a letter. Here it is.<br> You see the address.<br> If you don't help me, I must send it.<br> If you don't help me, I will send it.<br> You know what the result will be.<br> -The thing is quite simple, Allen.<br> -It would kill her.<br> I didn't think you would want<br> her name involved in such a scandal.<br> -I cannot do it!<br> -You have no choice.<br> I shall have to go home and<br> get some things from the laboratory.<br> You've saved my life.<br> Dorian dined that evening<br> with Lady Narborough,<br> who had what Lord Henry described as<br> the remains of<br> a really remarkable ugliness.<br> You left early last night, Dorian.<br> Did you go straight home<br> or did you go to the club?<br> Why are you so inquisitive, Harry?<br> I came in at 12:30.<br> If you want any corroborative evidence,<br> you can ask my man.<br> Remember your promise, Lord Henry.<br> There are two hours unaccounted for,<br> Dorian,<br> I suspect will bear investigation.<br> Or perhaps they will not.<br> You've hardly touched<br> my beautiful dinner, Lord Henry.<br> I believe you're in love.<br> I haven't been in love for a week.<br> Not since Madame de Farrol left town.<br> Madame de Farrol?<br> She's a wonderful woman,<br> Lady Narborough.<br> When her third husband died,<br> her hair turned quite gold from grief!<br> What's her fourth husband like?<br> Husbands of beautiful women<br> belong to the criminal classes.<br> I'm not surprised that the world says<br> you're extremely wicked.<br> What world says that, Lady Narborough?<br> It can only be the next world.<br> This world and Harry are on<br> excellent terms.<br> Everyone I know says he's wicked.<br> It's monstrous the way people go about<br> nowadays<br> saying things behind one's back<br> that are absolutely and entirely true.<br> Women love us for our defects.<br> If we have enough of them,<br> they'll forgive us anything,<br> -even our intellects.<br> -Very true.<br> At any rate, no one'll ever persuade me<br> that Mr. Gray is wicked.<br> And I shall never forgive him<br> for remaining a bachelor.<br> Don't you think we ought to<br> find a wife for Mr. Gray, Lord Henry?<br> I'm always telling him so.<br> I shall go through Debrett carefully tonight<br> and draw out a list of all the eligible<br> young ladies.<br> -With their ages?<br> -Only slightly edited.<br> I want it to be a suitable alliance.<br> I want you both to be happy.<br> I shall save you<br> the trouble of looking, Lady Narborough.<br> I have already chosen her,<br> if she will have me.<br> -I don't believe it.<br> -Gladys, darling. Will you marry me?<br> Of course I will, darling.<br> This is the only marriage<br> I've ever approved of.<br> -How terribly exciting.<br> -By Jove, that is a stunner!<br> -I'm so happy for you.<br> -I congratulate you both.<br> For months the mysterious disappearance<br> of Basil Hallward<br> was the sensation of London.<br> You don't mind if I go on with my work,<br> while we talk?<br> -Not at all.<br> -It's a matter of some urgency.<br> Tell me what you discovered in France.<br> We discovered nothing, nothing at all.<br> We hunted up everyone<br> even remotely acquainted with my uncle,<br> but not one had seen him<br> or heard from him.<br> The Paris police don't believe he ever<br> arrived in France.<br> And here, at Scotland Yard, we're equally<br> convinced he did leave London.<br> The man in the gray ulster who<br> boarded the train at Victoria Station<br> was undoubtedly Basil Hallward.<br> What are we to do now?<br> You're both young.<br> I understand you're engaged to marry.<br> Go on with your own lives peacefully.<br> Believe me, that's the best course.<br> I promise you, Scotland Yard will not<br> forget Basil Hallward.<br> I thought it might be good for Gladys<br> to go away for a while, out of London.<br> It would be.<br> I'm going to my country place<br> at Selby tomorrow.<br> I've persuaded Gladys to join me there<br> -with some friends on Thursday.<br> -Good.<br> The others are coming for the pheasant<br> shooting.<br> We'd be delighted<br> if you'd join us, Sir Robert.<br> Oh, I'm afraid I can't get away.<br> But I'm glad you're going.<br> The diversion will do you good.<br> Thank you, Sir Robert.<br> You've been very kind.<br> Not at all.<br> Mr. Gray?<br> Are you acquainted with<br> a young man named Allen Campbell?<br> Why, yes.<br> At one time we were great friends.<br> It's been a long time since I've seen him.<br> Why do you ask?<br> I've just received a very tragic notice.<br> This morning, Allen Campbell<br> died by his own hand.<br> -Why on earth should Allen Campbell...<br> -Why, indeed.<br> I thought you might give me a clue.<br> He had everything to live for.<br> He was just beginning to<br> achieve a name for himself in science.<br> He left no note or letter,<br> no explanation of any sort?<br> None. Whatever drove him to it,<br> he took the secret with him.<br> How little we really know<br> of what goes on inside a man.<br> Yes.<br> You've been sad all evening.<br> ls it Allen Campbell?<br> -Perhaps.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> Let's be married soon, in a fortnight.<br> A simple wedding<br> with only our closest friends.<br> A fortnight? You call that soon?<br> Good night, darling.<br> I'll come to Selby on the Thursday<br> afternoon train with Janet.<br> I'll be at the station.<br> Allen Campbell.<br> Would Allen's blood<br> be on the painting now?<br> There were other roads to forgetfulness<br> than the one that Allen took.<br> -Where to, sir?<br> -Bluegate Fields.<br> Yes, sir.<br> One day we shall be awakened<br> with suffering and dismay<br> to the realization that<br> the soul is not a superstition.<br> Nor the spirit of man, a material substance<br> that can be viewed under a microscope.<br> The eternal words are as true today<br> as when he uttered them.<br> "What shall it profit a man<br> if he gain the whole world<br> "and lose his soul?"<br> The soul is not an illusion.<br> It is a terrible reality.<br> It can be bought and sold<br> and bartered away.<br> It can be poisoned or made perfect.<br> That man, rich or poor, who has the light<br> of faith and charity within himself,<br> even though he were plunged<br> into the very pit of darkness,<br> would still enjoy the clear light of day.<br> But the wretched creature<br> whose soul is filled with dark thoughts<br> and foul deeds must dwell in darkness.<br> Even though he walk<br> under the noonday sun,<br> he must carry his own vile<br> dungeon round with him.<br> What's that you're playing?<br> It has a name, hasn't it?<br> A kind of name.<br> It's called Prelude.<br> Play something else!<br> -Why you do not like that music?<br> -I heard someone play that piece before.<br> -Eighteen years ago.<br> -A woman?<br> Every time I get back to London,<br> I look for him.<br> Sir Tristan, my sister called him.<br> Because he was like a knight.<br> If he was in Rangoon or Valparaiso,<br> I'd find him.<br> But in London,<br> it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.<br> I don't know his real name.<br> -I don't even know what he looks like.<br> -And when you find him, what will you do?<br> Maybe he's dead already.<br> Did you think of that?<br> I'll keep on looking.<br> -You're not English.<br> -What is English?<br> There are men and there are women.<br> This is Sir Tristan, Kate darling.<br> I've asked you not to call me that, Adrian.<br> I heard Lord Henry call you Sir Tristan,<br> and at the time I thought it fit.<br> -Why do we never see you?<br> -I have all I need here.<br> Drink and drugs and no friends.<br> I've had too many friends.<br> Oh, he's drawing a picture of you, sir.<br> Come and look at it.<br> What would you like?<br> A song, a poem, a painting?<br> I do all three surpassingly well.<br> It seems to me there's something lacking.<br> I have it.<br> "But grim to see<br> "is the gallows-tree."<br> Goodbye, Adrian.<br> "And, green or dry, a man must die<br> Before it bears its fruit."<br> Goodbye, Sir Tristan.<br> What did you call him?<br> Sit down.<br> I'll draw your picture<br> for the price of three drinks.<br> -Four drinks.<br> -Sir Tristan, you said.<br> And Sir Tristan rode forth into the forest,<br> seeking his only love.<br> He has gone to kill your friend.<br> Justice has come to England<br> without wig or gown.<br> Come on, Kate.<br> If it's money you want...<br> I'm Sibyl Vane's brother.<br> Does that mean anything to you?<br> -No, nothing.<br> -Why are you called Sir Tristan?<br> It happens to be my name.<br> You're lying.<br> How old do you think I am?<br> Why didn't you murder him?<br> They could only have hanged you for it.<br> He's not the man I'm looking for.<br> He's too young.<br> -How old do you think he is?<br> -22, I'd say.<br> What are you laughing at?<br> Dorian Gray has looked<br> What did you say his name was?<br> When a man says he has exhausted life,<br> you may be sure that<br> life has exhausted him.<br> But in your case,<br> this strange impulse to be good<br> is merely the effect of your<br> approaching marriage.<br> It will wear off in time. Do you mind,<br> pulling down that blind, Dorian?<br> Not at all. The truth is I want to be better.<br> I'm determined to be better.<br> Well, at least it will be a novel sensation,<br> and needn't become a habit.<br> Marriage itself is merely a habit,<br> a very bad habit.<br> I trust it won't make you<br> a hopelessly reformed character.<br> Harry, I've been away so long.<br> What are people talking about in London?<br> They were talking<br> about Basil's disappearance.<br> But now they are completely taken up<br> with Allen Campbell's suicide.<br> What do you think has happened to Basil?<br> I haven't the slightest idea.<br> I suppose in a fortnight or so,<br> we shall be told that<br> he's been seen in San Francisco.<br> It's an odd thing,<br> but everyone who disappears<br> is said to be seen in San Francisco.<br> It must be a delightful city and possess<br> all the attractions of the next world.<br> He was a fine painter. I'm certain of that.<br> You know, the best thing<br> that Basil ever did<br> was that wonderful portrait of you.<br> I remember you told me<br> it was stolen or destroyed or something.<br> What is your secret, Dorian?<br> You don't look a day older than<br> you did when that portrait was painted.<br> Perhaps I'll tell you some day.<br> To get back my youth,<br> I'd do anything in the world,<br> except get up early,<br> take exercise or be respectable.<br> I sometimes think I'd give anything<br> if I could change<br> and grow old like other people.<br> My good resolutions<br> may have come too late.<br> Though Dorian placed<br> guards about the estate,<br> the consciousness of being hunted,<br> snared, tracked down<br> began to dominate him.<br> ln the small hours of the night,<br> when every sound is seized upon<br> by the distraught imagination,<br> remorse and terror laid hold of him.<br> Each detail of his crimes came back to him<br> in nightmares with added horror,<br> haunting him relentlessly<br> with the living death of his soul.<br> With the day came the cruel necessity<br> to dissemble to Gladys and to his guests.<br> -Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?<br> -Not very good, Dorian.<br> I think most<br> of the birds have gone to the open.<br> It may be better after lunch,<br> when we get to new ground.<br> -Don't shoot it, Geoffrey.<br> -Nonsense.<br> Good heavens, I've hit a beater.<br> What an idiot the man was<br> to get in front of the gun.<br> Stop shooting there. A man's hurt.<br> Where, sir? Where is he?<br> Here. Why on earth<br> don't you keep your men back?<br> Spoiled my shooting for the day.<br> I've told them<br> the shooting's stopped for today.<br> It wouldn't look well to go on.<br> -Is the man...<br> -Yes, he's dead.<br> He received the full charge in his chest.<br> Thornton, come in.<br> I suppose you've come about<br> the unfortunate accident this morning.<br> Was he married? Did he have<br> any people dependent upon him?<br> I'll write them any sum<br> you think necessary.<br> We don't know who he is, sir. That's why<br> I took the liberty of coming to you.<br> -Wasn't he one of your men?<br> -No, sir. Never saw him before.<br> Seemed like a sailor.<br> A sailor!<br> Looks as if he'd been a sort of sailor.<br> Tattooed on both arms<br> and that kind of thing.<br> Wasn't anything found on him,<br> anything that would tell his name?<br> Some money, not much, and a six-shooter.<br> No name of any kind.<br> Decent-looking man, sir. But rough-like.<br> A sort of sailor, we think.<br> -Where is the body?<br> -In an empty stable at the home farm, sir.<br> Show me his face.<br> Come in.<br> What is it, Dorian?<br> Oh, but you haven't changed.<br> You'll be late for dinner.<br> I wanted to look at you.<br> I know, darling.<br> I've felt that way so often about you.<br> -Goodbye, Gladys.<br> -Goodbye? Until half past eight.<br> Until half past eight.<br> Go on.<br> -Shall I go on, sir?<br> -Yes.<br> Dorian.<br> Dorian!<br> David! What brings you to Selby?<br> Have you seen Dorian?<br> Well, what is it? What's happened?<br> Dorian's gone to London. Didn't you know?<br> David passed him<br> on his way from the station.<br> -It's strange, his rushing away like that.<br> -He looked black as thunder.<br> I thought perhaps he'd found out<br> what I've been up to.<br> What have you been up to, David?<br> You'll put it down to jealousy.<br> I don't deny that jealousy's mixed up in it.<br> But I had a dreadful presentiment<br> about you and Dorian.<br> And when you announced<br> the date of your marriage, I...<br> I grew desperate.<br> I wanted to do anything to try and stop it.<br> What is it you've done, David?<br> There is a locked room<br> at the top of Dorian's house.<br> I didn't attach any importance to it at first.<br> He could have locked up anything there<br> that he wanted to keep safe,<br> from the servants, even.<br> But then one of Dorian's valets<br> came to see me about a position.<br> It struck me how often Dorian<br> changed his servants.<br> This one told me that Dorian<br> would steal up to that room at all hours<br> and lock himself in.<br> One night he heard a noise<br> and went to investigate.<br> It was 4:00 in the morning.<br> Dorian came out of the room<br> and looked at him in the strangest way.<br> As if he could kill him, he said.<br> Then he accused him of spying<br> and sacked him.<br> I began to feel that if<br> I could get into that room<br> I might find something<br> that would put a stop to this marriage.<br> And did you get in?<br> I bribed one of his servants<br> to get me an impression of the lock.<br> Here's the key.<br> I waited until Dorian came down<br> here to Selby and then I let myself in.<br> I know you'll despise me for stooping<br> to such measures but I'm not important.<br> It doesn't matter what happens to me<br> or even what you think of me<br> -if I can stop you from marrying him.<br> -What did you find in the room?<br> Nothing to help me, really.<br> It's just an old schoolroom<br> with books and things.<br> And there's a huge portrait<br> with a covering over it.<br> -A portrait? Of whom?<br> -I don't know.<br> The original must be a monstrous person,<br> if an original exists.<br> It has a vague<br> family resemblance to Dorian.<br> A sort of middle-aged,<br> mad, gruesome uncle<br> with a debauched face<br> and blood all over him.<br> -It was painted by your uncle.<br> -My uncle never painted such a picture.<br> He signed it.<br> I'd been counting so much<br> on finding something to help me<br> that I decided perhaps<br> it was just stupid jealousy on my part<br> and I'd been doing Dorian a great injustice.<br> I had an impulse to come down here and<br> make a clean breast of it to both of you.<br> Give you my blessing<br> and ask your forgiveness.<br> Can you describe the portrait<br> in greater detail?<br> There's a curious cat in it.<br> Like the one in Dorian's drawing room.<br> Only, in the portrait, the eyes shine<br> in an evil way that's indescribable.<br> Did you notice anything<br> unusual about the signature?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> Now that I see you, Gladys.<br> I can't say what I intended to.<br> I'd be lying if I did.<br> I know that this marriage is wrong.<br> You mustn't go through with it.<br> There's something strange<br> and evil in Dorian.<br> Was there a letter G under the signature<br> on that painting, David?<br> Like this?<br> I believe there was. How did you know?<br> -Yes, Gibson?<br> -I beg your pardon, miss.<br> But Mr. Gray asked me to bring you this<br> letter when I got back from the station.<br> -He said I must give it to you in person.<br> -Thank you.<br> Once I said that if I were to marry you,<br> it would be an incredible wickedness.<br> You thought it was a way of saying<br> that I didn't love you.<br> You must know that I do love you,<br> more than anything in the world.<br> But I can only bring disaster<br> on those who love me.<br> If you knew how I've already wronged you,<br> you would turn from me in horror.<br> You will never see me again.<br> Try to remember me, dear Gladys,<br> without bitterness.<br> This is the only good thing<br> I have ever done.<br> Won't you tell us what it is, Gladys?<br> Perhaps we can help you.<br> We must go to London at once.<br> Was it true that one could never change?<br> He longed for the<br> unstained purity of his youth,<br> before he had prayed in a monstrous<br> moment of pride and passion<br> that the painting should bear the burden<br> of the years and of his corruptions.<br> Sibyl Vane was dead.<br> And now her brother<br> would be hidden in a nameless grave.<br> Allen Campbell had shot himself.<br> And Basil...<br> Nothing could alter that.<br> It was of the future that he must think.<br> He had spared Gladys.<br> Would there be any sign<br> of his one good deed in the portrait?<br> It was there, almost imperceptible,<br> but surely it was there in the eyes,<br> struggling through the horror<br> and the loathsomeness.<br> There was hope for him, then.<br> He would go away, leave England forever,<br> live obscurely in a distant country,<br> find peace in<br> a life of humility and self-denial.<br> He would expel every sign<br> of evil from the painted face.<br> He would watch<br> the hideousness fade and change.<br> But the painting would always<br> be there to tempt his weakness.<br> Better to destroy it,<br> to grow old inevitably<br> as all men grow old.<br> If he fell into evil ways,<br> to be punished as all men are punished.<br> Better if each sin of his life<br> were to bring its sure, swift penalty.<br> The knife that had killed Basil Hallward<br> would kill his portrait also<br> and free him at a stroke from<br> the evil enchantment of the past.<br> But when the knife<br> pierced the heart of the portrait,<br> an extraordinary thing happened.<br> Pray, Father, forgive me.<br> Pray, Father, forgive me for I have sinned.<br> Pray, Father, forgive me for I have sinned.<br> Through my fault,<br> through my most grievous faults.<br> Heaven forgive me.<br> Take Gladys home, David.<br>
