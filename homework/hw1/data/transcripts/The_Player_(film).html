May I take a message?<br> - Yes, I'll tell him you called.<br> - Sandy, never say that.<br> He's either in conference, in a meeting. He's always in.<br> - Now, who was that?<br> - A Larry Levy?<br> I hope there was nothing in the trades. Was there?<br> I don't know. The mail's late.<br> - Well, go get them. Now!<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> I want them back here before he arrives.<br> ADAM: Griffin. Griffin, hi.<br> Adam Simon. I know we're not supposed to meet till next week...<br> - ...but a lot of heat...<br> - Didn't realize we were meeting.<br> I wanted to plant the seed in your head just so that...<br> I'm booked up. I can't hear a pitch.<br> Picture this. It's a planet in the far, far future with two suns.<br> - Who plays the sons?<br> - No, suns. Large solar disks.<br> You gotta run this idea by Bonnie Sherow.<br> Pictures they make these days are all MTV. Cut, cut, cut, cut.<br> The opening shot of Welles' Touch of Evil was six and a half minutes long.<br> Six and a half minutes, Walter?<br> Well, three or four. Anyway, he set up the whole picture with that one tracking shot.<br> My father was the key grip on that shoot.<br> Hey, what about Absolute Beginners? Man, that was an extraordinary shot.<br> - What was that? Never heard of it.<br> - Julien Temple. It's an English film.<br> - GRIFFIN: Morning.<br> - We're talking about American movies...<br> ...and Orson Welles was a master.<br> - GRIFFIN: Can I have a Pellegrino, please?<br> - JAN: I've got Calistoga.<br> - GRIFFIN: Hi, Buck, how are you?<br> - Good, how you doing?<br> - GRIFFIN: Good. What do you got for me?<br> - Okay, here it is.<br> - The Graduate Part Two.<br> - Oh, good, good.<br> Now, listen. The three principals are still with us.<br> Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross.<br> GRIFFIN: Mm-hm.<br> Twenty-five years later, and so are the characters.<br> Ben, Elaine and Mrs. Robinson.<br> Ben and Elaine are married still.<br> They live in a big, old, spooky house up in northern California somewhere...<br> ...and Mrs. Robinson lives with them.<br> - GRIFFIN: Mm.<br> - Her aging mother, who's had a stroke...<br> - Mrs. Robinson's had a stroke?<br> - Had a stroke, so she can't talk.<br> - Is this gonna be funny?<br> - Yeah, it'll be funny.<br> Dark, and weird, and funny and with a stroke.<br> - Okay.<br> - Maybe it's not a stroke.<br> - Maybe it's... I don't know what it is.<br> - Anyway, go on.<br> - It's a malady of some sort.<br> - Okay.<br> She's up there in the bedroom upstairs, listening to everything that happens.<br> They've got a daughter who's just graduated from college.<br> - Young blood.<br> - Twenty-two, 23-year-old.<br> - Like a Julia Roberts.<br> - Julia Roberts. Great.<br> - JAN: Excuse me.<br> - Yes?<br> - What do I do with these scripts?<br> - Uh, that goes to Bonnie Sherow.<br> And, uh, find out from studio security how Adam Simon got on the lot.<br> - I wanna know.<br> - Okay. Adam Simon? Okay.<br> - Okay? Julia Roberts comes home.<br> - Yes, go ahead.<br> Their daughter, the graduate.<br> - And she brings her...<br> - The new graduate.<br> ADAM: Griffin loved it. He wanted me to run it by you.<br> A band of human survivors, generations removed from the mother ship.<br> They have no history. They've lost their technological knowledge.<br> I can't process this. Could you write it down?<br> It's not about words, it's about pictures.<br> [JIMMY YELLS]<br> [CRASH]<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - Oh, man.<br> Jimmy? Jimmy, are you okay?<br> - What happened?<br> - JIMMY: Twenty-five words or less?<br> BONNIE: Are you all right?<br> JIMMY: I'd like to say, my name is Jimmy Chase.<br> BONNIE: You all right? Open your eyes. You okay?<br> DRIVER: He just came out of nowhere, ran right into the car.<br> - BONNIE: Take it slow.<br> - ADAM: It's okay.<br> Yeah, it's okay.<br> JIMMY: Hey. Hey, that's Adam Simon.<br> ADAM: How you doing, kid? I just had a meeting.<br> - BONNIE: You all right?<br> - ADAM: It was good.<br> - JIMMY: Yeah, yeah.<br> - BONNIE: You sure you're okay?<br> REG: Rebecca De Mornay. Actually, you're much better looking.<br> - STEVE: As a matter of fact, we...<br> - WOMAN: Um, no.<br> - I'm not Rebecca De Mornay.<br> - REG: Dead ringer.<br> Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> REG: You know where Joel Levison's office is?<br> WOMAN: The Mr. Levison, head of the studio? Yeah.<br> STEVE: But it's quite moving. It'll rip your heart out.<br> This is the area where we make decisions to give a green light to a picture like that.<br> Right here. We're gonna go about 17 stories high, if we can.<br> We're gonna continue using Sony products. Domo arigato to the Sony products, really.<br> In fact, if you need someone to eat some sashimi with you...<br> ...you give me a ring because...<br> - Levison's right here.<br> - BONNIE: Write it down.<br> ADAM: I have to know that you're just seeing it.<br> CELIA: Good girl.<br> LEVISON: Traffic from Malibu was impossible.<br> - CELIA: Morning, Joel.<br> - LEVISON: Morning, Celia.<br> - Sandy, park the car, please.<br> - SANDY: Okay.<br> - LEVISON: Morning, Marty.<br> - MARTY: Morning, Joel.<br> CELIA: Hi.<br> - MARTY: What are the Japs doing here?<br> - So, what's this talk about heads will roll?<br> The bank's putting the screws to us.<br> Harvey Goldman's son's coming out, and I don't like it.<br> Reggie Goldman's a pipsqueak. You can't be serious.<br> You know, some changes are going on around here.<br> It's always the way. Happened at Paramount three years ago.<br> Columbia's going through it now.<br> I hear we're looking to replace Griffin.<br> Griffin? I don't believe it. With who?<br> MARTY: Berg, Kirkpatrick. Maybe Larry Levy.<br> Yeah. Yeah, well, I wanna know why the security is so lax, that's why.<br> I'll talk to you about it later. I'm in the middle of a pitch.<br> - Listen. Go ahead.<br> - Yeah, okay, okay.<br> It's a TV star and she goes on safari in Africa.<br> You're talking about a TV star in a motion picture?<br> Not a real TV star. It would be played by a movie star.<br> - A movie star playing a television star.<br> - Goldie, Julia, Michelle...<br> - ...Bette, Lily.<br> - Dolly Parton.<br> - PARTICIA: Dolly.<br> - JOAN: She would be very good.<br> - GRIFFIN: I like Goldie.<br> - JOAN: Goldie Goes to Africa.<br> Great. We have a relationship.<br> - That would be great. Goldie Goes to Africa.<br> - Goldie Goes to Africa.<br> - JOAN: She becomes worshiped.<br> - GRIFFIN: Worshiped?<br> - Well, she's found by this tribe...<br> - GRIFFIN: Yes?<br> Of small people. But then she has to...<br> She's found by this tribe and they worship her. But then...<br> GRIFFIN: I see. It's like a Gods Must Be Crazy...<br> ...except the Coke bottle's now a television actress.<br> Yeah, exactly right. It's Out of Africa meets Pretty Woman.<br> And she has to decide...<br> ...whether to stay with the TV show or save this entire African tribe.<br> JOAN: It could be a man.<br> - Hey, where's Griffin Mill's office?<br> - JIMMY: Right here.<br> - Hey, you're Martin Scorsese.<br> - ALAN: No, but I know Harvey Keitel.<br> Yeah, I know you do. Hey, I loved Cape Fear. Ha, ha.<br> - My old man worked for Hitchcock too.<br> - Yeah?<br> Rope. It was a masterpiece. The story wasn't any good.<br> He shot the whole thing without cuts. I hate all this cut, cut, cut.<br> Oh, yeah, well, what about, uh, Bertolucci, that great tracking shot...<br> - ...with Winger in Sheltering Sky?<br> - I didn't see it.<br> Touch of Evil, that was the one. Welles...<br> WHITNEY: I been here since 8:00. Honest I have.<br> I stuck my neck out for you to get this job. Who were you with?<br> - I was there with, um, Alan Rudolph.<br> - What were you doing with Alan Rudolph?<br> Well, no, he asked me to have coffee. He was telling me this idea.<br> - What do I say?<br> - You're my assistant.<br> - Don't get involved with writers.<br> - I wasn't. I was just listening to this idea.<br> - I told him he should give it to you.<br> - GRIFFIN: What's your pitch?<br> Well, does political scare you?<br> GRIFFIN: Political doesn't scare me. Radical political scares me.<br> - "Political" political scares me.<br> - This is politely politically radical.<br> - Is it funny?<br> - It's funny.<br> - It's a funny political thing.<br> - It's a thriller too.<br> - It's a thriller?<br> - All at once.<br> So, uh, what's the story?<br> Well, I want Bruce Willis. I think I can talk to him.<br> Um, it's a story about a senator. A bad-guy senator at first.<br> He's traveling around the country on the country's dime.<br> - Like that Sununu guy used to do.<br> - Sort of a cynical, political thriller-comedy?<br> Yeah, but it's got a heart, uh, in the right spot.<br> And anyway, he has an accident.<br> - An accident?<br> - Yeah, and he becomes clairvoyant.<br> - Like a psychic. Yeah.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> So it's kind of a psychic, political thriller-comedy with a heart.<br> With a heart. And, uh, not unlike Ghost meets Manchurian Candidate.<br> - Go on, I'm listening.<br> - He can start to read people's minds...<br> ...and when he gets to the president's mind, it's completely blank. Completely blank.<br> - JAN: Can I get you anything?<br> - ALAN: I'd like a beer, please.<br> - JAN: We don't have beer.<br> - ALAN: Uh, wine. Red wine, please.<br> Of course, someone gets killed at the end. They always do in political thrillers.<br> [PHONE RINGS]<br> Griffin Mill's office.<br> MAN [ON PHONE]: I know. Can you put him on?<br> - GRIFFIN: It's an intriguing idea, Jim.<br> - May I ask who's calling?<br> MAN [ON PHONE]: I'd like to speak to Griffin Mill.<br> JAN: He's in a meeting. I'll have him get back to you.<br> - GRIFFIN: I'll get back to you.<br> - JIM: Thanks.<br> - JAN: Excuse me, sir?<br> - MAN [ON PHONE]: Bullshit.<br> - He'll get back to me?<br> - Seen my Binaca?<br> Do you know how many times I've heard that?<br> - JAN: Who is this?<br> - MAN: If he don't get back to me...<br> - BONNIE: I read that script.<br> - Who was that?<br> JAN: I don't know. He didn't say.<br> - What do you mean, he didn't say?<br> - BONNIE: How are you gonna cast it?<br> The lead character is a 50-year-old female circus performer.<br> - A fire-eater.<br> - Let me read the coverage.<br> Are we still having lunch with Aaron Camp?<br> - GRIFFIN: Yeah, what time?<br> - I made it for 1:00.<br> - Bad day?<br> - JAN: He's having writer's block.<br> You have a meeting with Harders and Frank South this afternoon.<br> - What time? I'll be here.<br> - At 3:00. Okay.<br> Put the meetings on the computer.<br> - All right.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You going now? I'll go with you.<br> - I'm going to see Levison.<br> I'll meet you there. Order me a salad and Crystal Geyser.<br> - Okay. Bye.<br> - Thanks.<br> WOMAN: Bonnie, can I please...?<br> BONNIE: We gotta have a time to meet. I'm sorry.<br> - Okay, by 5? Thanks, Sandy.<br> - Bye.<br> - Hi, Sandy. Hi, Celia.<br> - Oh, uh...<br> You can't go in there. He's in a meeting.<br> REG: I think, you know, dime a dozen out here, don't you?<br> - It's all right, Celia.<br> - You know this one?<br> Griffin, I don't think you've met Reg Goldman.<br> - You know his father, Harvey.<br> - Yes, of course. Hi. Hi, Reg.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - From the bank in Boston.<br> - Reg is out here for a couple of weeks.<br> - Great.<br> - Business or pleasure?<br> - A little of both, I hope.<br> Reg is thinking of getting into production, Griffin.<br> Oh, really?<br> REG: Yeah. It beats work, doesn't it, Griffin?<br> Like to play some tennis though. You play tennis?<br> Tennis? No, no, no. I, uh, ha, ha...<br> - I'm too busy for...<br> - I was just asking Walter here.<br> Uh, do you know Meg Ryan?<br> Do you know if she's seeing somebody?<br> Um, yeah, Reg, she's married.<br> Shit.<br> What about Winona Ryder?<br> Um, well, uh, you know, actually Walter is the guy to talk to.<br> Walter's got everybody's number.<br> - LEVISON: Was there anything?<br> - Uh, no. You're real busy.<br> I want that number, goddamn it. I want that number.<br> Oh, boy. What about this one here? Has she done anything?<br> Celia.<br> Griffin, don't ask.<br> Don't ask, "You don't know" or don't ask, "I don't wanna know"?<br> Just don't ask.<br> Look, if it's... If it's Reggie Goldman you're concerned about, forget it.<br> But be nice to him. He represents a lot of money.<br> It's not Reggie Goldman I'm worried about.<br> - It's Larry Levy.<br> - Larry Levy?<br> Larry Levy's at Fox, isn't he?<br> [GRIFFIN CHUCKLES]<br> Oh, come on, Celia.<br> OPERATOR [OVER INTERCOM]: Sandy, there's a call for Celia on Line 1.<br> - Should I be looking for a job?<br> - OPERATOR: Celia, are you there?<br> Joel Levison's office.<br> Oh, Brad. Yeah. What?<br> No, we couldn't sign Anjelica Huston for that project.<br> She's booked for the next two years.<br> Yeah, like a ghost story, but that's not like Ghost.<br> - Well, now...<br> - Um, in which, maybe...<br> We should be somewhere...<br> - ...but I understand what you're saying.<br> - Unnatural Lives. It's a supernatural thing.<br> GRIFFIN: Joel. Griffin Mill.<br> - Friend of Jennifer's.<br> - No, no.<br> - You're Griffin Mill?<br> - Yes.<br> - Really?<br> - Good to see you.<br> - I'm a big fan.<br> - I have that tie.<br> - You do?<br> - Mr. Mill, how are you today?<br> - Okay. How are you doing, Natalie?<br> - Fine. Have a seat.<br> FEMALE EXEC: Where's Bonnie?<br> - Did you order for me?<br> - FEMALE EXEC: Oh, my gosh. I'm shocked.<br> - AARON: Hi, Griffin.<br> - WOMAN: Hi.<br> - Hi, buddy.<br> - Hi. How are you?<br> Lunching with the enemy.<br> [BONNIE CHUCKLES]<br> ELLEN: Oh, come on.<br> ELLEN: So, uh, what's this we hear about Larry Levy?<br> Larry Levy? If he had half a brain, he'd be dangerous.<br> [ALL CHUCKLE]<br> BONNIE: Aaron says he's coming to the studio.<br> GRIFFIN: Aaron says, eh? Why would you believe anything he says?<br> I don't know. The way he said it.<br> The authority he said it with. He's over there with...<br> - Who?<br> - Anjelica Huston and John Cusack.<br> - Levy?<br> - BONNIE: Yep.<br> GRIFFIN: He's in over his head. They're gonna drown over there.<br> FEMALE EXEC: Quite the golden boy at Fox these days.<br> Did you see that thing on him in Variety?<br> - The big spread?<br> - ELLEN: Oh, two pages.<br> - AARON: Sure.<br> - Anjelica.

In a few minutes.<br> - We're wasting away.<br> - BONNIE: Your hands are as cold as mine.<br> - Freezing.<br> I think...

He's a buddy...<br> - GRIFFIN: What's going on with my job?<br> I mean, you know, Larry Levy, everywhere I look.<br> - He's in my face.<br> - Larry Levy's a comer.<br> That's what comers do, they get in your face.<br> You're a comer too. You can handle him. Stop worrying about it.<br> So the rumors are true?<br> - Rumors are always true, you know that.<br> - I'm always the last to hear about them.<br> You're the last one to believe. I told you that before.<br> So am I out?<br> MELLEN: Not out, but start thinking about a roommate.<br> Relax, you can handle this. You know, you can make him work for it.<br> - LEVY: Excuse me...<br> - MELLEN: Larry?<br> Dick. Sorry to crash your party.<br> - MELLEN: Do you know everybody?<br> - LEVY: I will before the night's out.<br> MELLEN: You will. You will indeed. It's a good crowd of people.<br> [GRIFFIN SIGHS]<br> - REG: Great party, Dick.<br> - MELLEN: Good. Did you get some food?<br> - Actually, we're gonna...<br> - MELLEN: Not yet.<br> Listen to this.

Big advertising agency.<br> Account executive makes a presentation to someone he wants as a client.<br> The client promises to get back to him.<br> - Does it have to be advertising?<br> - That's not the problem.<br> The account executive keeps waiting for the client to call him back...<br> ...to tell him what he thought of the idea, tell him if he got the job or not...<br> ...but the client never calls.<br> So the account executive gets so pissed off, so frustrated...<br> ...that he becomes obsessive, and he decides to drive the client crazy.<br> - What does he do?<br> - Sends him threatening postcards.<br> It's not important.<br> Here's the problem.<br> How long do you think the account executive harasses the client...<br> ...before he becomes dangerous?<br> - Does it have to be advertising?<br> - How long?<br> All right, if it were me...<br> - One month?<br> - Three months.<br> No, no, no, more. Five months.<br> - To be dangerous, five months.<br> - Five months. That's what I thought.<br> - Who's the writer?<br> - I don't know.<br> You don't know the writer who pitched you the idea?<br> I don't know his name. I don't know. It's a couple of kids.

On the museum party.<br> I will not work for Larry Levy.<br> I'm not asking you to.<br> I report to you. If I have to report to Larry Levy, I quit.<br> You can't quit.<br> I won't let you quit. You have a year and a half on your contract.<br> And I will sue you for breach if you don't show up in the office every day with a smile.<br> Why Levy?<br> Levy was available. He's good on material, you're good with writers.<br> We're a team. He's a new member of the team, that's all.<br> - He can make us all look good.<br> - This is a red-wine glass.<br> Can I have my water in a water glass, please?<br> Well?<br> I'll have to think about it, Joel.<br> I want an answer this afternoon.<br> Well, I have to go out to Palmdale.<br> The director of The Lonely Room is giving Lily a hard time.<br> I'll be back around 5.<br> - So call after 5.<br> - I'll get back to you.<br> REYNOLDS: But I said, "You know, you haven't gone...

Well, let's, uh... Let's start.<br> - Larry was in the middle of something.<br> - No. I wasn't.<br> I was just killing time waiting for Griffin.<br> Well, no. Finish. What were you saying?<br> I was just saying that I've yet to meet a writer...<br> ...who could change water into wine, and we have a tendency to treat them like that.<br> - CELIA: As soon as you're finished.<br> - Not at this studio.<br> Million, million and a half for these scripts. It's...<br> It's nuts.<br> And I think avoidable.<br> Griffin, Let me ask you something. When was the last time you actually bought a ticket to see a movie?<br> - Actually paid your own money to see it?<br> - Last night.<br> Pasadena. The Bicycle Thief.<br> - You went to see The Bicycle Thief?<br> - I love that film. It's a great film.<br> LEVY: It's art movie. Doesn't count. We're talking about "movie" movies.<br> Jesus, people.<br> All I'm saying is I think a lot of time and money can be saved...<br> ...if we came up with these stories on our own.<br> Where are these stories coming from, Larry?<br> Anywhere, anywhere. It doesn't matter. Anywhere. Um...<br> The newspaper. Pick a story. Any story.<br> [STEVE CLEARS THROAT]<br> All right.<br> "Immigrants Protest Budget Cuts in Literacy Program."<br> Human spirit overcoming economic adversity.<br> Sounds like Horatio Alger in the barrio.<br> Put Jimmy Smits in it and you got a sexy Stand and Deliver.<br> - Next. Come on.<br> - Larry, this isn't my field.<br> LEVY: Marty, it doesn't matter. Just give it a shot. You can't lose here.<br> MARTY: Okay.<br> How about, uh, "Mudslide Kills 60 in Slums of Chili"?<br> LEVY: That's good. Triumph over tragedy. Sounds like a John Boorman picture.<br> You slap a happy ending on it, the script will write itself.<br> - Bon. Here, give me the paper.<br> - BONNIE: Gee, I don't know, Lar.<br> Give it a shot.<br> [BONNIE SIGHS]<br> "Further bond losses push Dow down 7.15."<br> - LEVY: Okay.<br> - BONNIE: I see Connery as Bond.<br> LEVY: That's funny.

Nothing to sneeze at.<br> Okay. I think Larry's point is well taken. Let's move on now.<br> Griffin, uh, can you give us an update on the Taylor Hackford project?<br> Griffin?<br> Yeah.<br> I was just thinking what an interesting concept it is to eliminate the writer...<br> ...from the artistic process.<br> If we can just get rid of these actors and directors, maybe we got something here.<br> [ALL CHUCKLE]<br> GRIFFIN: Hello, Walter.<br> - Make yourself at home.<br> - WALTER: Mr. Mill.<br> I understand you were kind of late coming in this morning.<br> - You all right?<br> - I'm fine.<br> Appreciate your concern.<br> What can I do for you, Walter?<br> Don't tell me you came here to pitch me a story.<br> Ha, ha. That's exactly what I've come to do.<br> It's a good one too. It's about a writer. Sort of. David Kahane.<br> David Kahane.<br> - Who's David Kahane?<br> - Oh, you met him.<br> Well, I meet a lot of writers.<br> Uh-huh. But this particular writer that you met was murdered last night...<br> - ...in back of the Rialto Theater in Pasadena.<br> - Murdered?<br> Well, come to think of it, Pasadena's as good a place to die as any.<br> So, what's the story?<br> Okay. Movie exec calls writer.<br> Writer's girlfriend says he's at the movies. Exec got to the movies, meets writer...<br> ...drinks with writer. Writer gets conked and dies in 4 inches of dirty water.<br> Movie exec is in deep shit.<br> What do you think?<br> That's more than 25 words and it's bullshit.<br> [WALTER CHUCKLES]<br> Pasadena Homicide doesn't think it's bullshit. They got a complete report.<br> You met Kahane at the Rialto. You got drunk with him at a restaurant.<br> He left before you did. That's the last time anyone saw him alive...<br> ...except you maybe.<br> Why are you denying this?<br> Well, what do the police think?<br> They think it's a botched robbery. You know...<br> ...window of his car was busted.<br> He surprised someone trying to take the radio.<br> There was a fight, he was killed.<br> I didn't kill him, Walter...<br> ...but I went to see him.<br> I know I said I didn't, but I did.<br> - Why'd you lie to me?<br> - Well...<br> ...now's not a very good time for me.<br> Haven't you heard the rumors? I'm on my way out.<br> Just what I need, a little more controversy.<br> Just not a good time, Walter.<br> Look.<br> I am in charge of studio security in every definition of the word...<br> ...which means it is my job to take care of a studio executive...<br> ...should he be, uh, shall we say, under suspicion of murder...<br> ...at a time when profits are down and the company is vulnerable for a takeover.<br> It is my job to keep this very, very, very, very quiet!<br> You wanna help?<br> - Of course.<br> - Then stop lying.<br> - How many meetings did you have?<br> - One.<br> - Not counting last night?<br> - Not counting last night.<br> Why'd you go all the way to Pasadena to meet?<br> He had an idea I was interested in. I wanted to talk to him.<br> His girlfriend.<br> I guess she was a friend of yours too. Think fast!<br> Jesus Christ, Walter, what do you think? What is this?<br> The third degree. If you don't like it, wait till the police start asking you question.<br> - I'll go right now.<br> - They'll be a lot less polite!<br> - You come with me!<br> - You're acting like someone's who's guilty.<br> You're not guilty, are you?<br> For the last time, I'm not a murderer.<br> [FAX MACHINE BEEPS]<br> WALTER: Bad news?<br> - What?<br> - The fax. Is it bad news?<br> No.<br> Business as usual.<br> PHIL: The Hollywood system did not murder David Kahane.<br> Not the $98-million movie, not the $12-million actor.<br> Not even the million-dollar deal that David Kahane never landed.<br> No, the most that we can pin on Hollywood is assault with intent to kill.<br> Because society is responsible for this particular murder...<br> ...and it is to society that we must look if we are to have any justice for that crime.<br> Because someone in the night...<br> ...killed David Kahane, and that person will have to bear the guilt.<br> And if David were here right now, I know in my heart that he would say:<br> "Cut the shit, Phil.<br> "What did you learn from all of this? Did you learn anything from this?"<br> [CHUCKLES] And I'd say, "Uh, yeah, David, uh, I've learned a lot.<br> "We here, uh... We'll take it from here."<br> And the next time we sell a script for a million dollars...<br> ...the next time we nail some shit-bag producer to the wall, we'll say:<br> "That's another one for David Kahane."<br> David was working on something the day he died. I'd, uh, like to share it with you.<br> "Blackness. A mangy dog barks.<br> "Garbage can lids are lifted as derelicts in the street hunt for food.<br> "Buzzing, as a cheap alarm clock goes off.<br> "Interior. Flophouse room. Early morning.<br> "A tracking shot moves through the grimy room.<br> "Light streams in through holes in the yellowing window shades.<br> "Moths dance in the beams of light.<br> "Track down along the floor. The frayed rug.<br> "Stop on an old shoe.<br> "It's empty."<br> That's as far as he got.<br> That's the last thing he wrote.<br> So long, Dave.<br> Fade out.<br> Thank you.<br> Who are you? You're not a writer.<br> No. I'm Griffin Mill.<br> - We spoke the night David was...<br> - Blue sea, white sea. Yes.<br> It turned out you were right.<br> - What?<br> - It was a red sea.<br> Oh. Yeah.<br> You're the only person I know here.<br> Listen, I'm really sorry about David.<br> He was, uh...<br> ...a talent.<br> You really think so?<br> I always suspected he was...<br> ...uniquely untalented.<br> It's nice of you to say that.<br> - Nice of you to come. You didn't have to.<br> - GRIFFIN: Well, I did.<br> You know, I was probably the last person to see him alive.<br> Yeah. The police told me.<br> - Well, not quite the last, surely.<br> - No.<br> I'm sure this is a terrible time for you.<br> Is there anything you need or...?<br> No, really. I...<br> I don't feel bad.<br> It's like when my parents died.<br> I didn't feel anything at all. They were just gone.<br> Well, I'm sure it hasn't sunk in yet.<br> - That was years ago.<br> - No, I meant David.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, God.<br> These people. I don't like it here.<br> They're all expecting me to grieve and mourn, and I can't talk to them.<br> David's gone...<br> ...and I'm somewhere else already.<br> - Will you take me home?<br> - What?<br> Will you take me home?<br> Sure. I'm right here.<br> These are very interesting. I like them.<br> - Would you like a drink?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Where do you show?<br> - Hmm?<br> Gallery. What gallery?<br> - Who's your dealer?<br> - I don't have a dealer.<br> I couldn't sell these. They're never finished.<br> Bicky?<br> No, thanks. They're never finished?<br> No, they're just what I do, for myself.<br> What I feel.<br> You ask lots of questions, Mr. Mill.<br> You're just like the police. That's all they did, ask questions.<br> They asked me a lot about you.<br> - Did they?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> How long we've known each other, if you'd ever been to the house before.<br> Well, I suppose they have to ask those questions.<br> I don't see why.<br> Because that's what police do.<br> - Can I ask you a question?<br> - Sure.<br> Why was it so important to see David that night?<br> What was so urgent?<br> Well, he pitched me a story a few months ago and...<br> - The Japan story, right?<br> - Yes, the Japan story.<br> I liked it at the time, but it needed work, especially the ending.<br> And I was sitting in my office that day...<br> ...and it suddenly occurred to me how to make the ending work.<br> So, what was it?<br> - What?<br> - Your idea for the ending?<br> Up.<br> - "Up"?<br> - Up.<br> - What does that mean?<br> - As opposed to down. Moods.<br> You know, happy as opposed to sad, hopeful as opposed to depressing.<br> - What did you think of his ending?<br> - I never read it.<br> - You never read it?<br> - Nope.<br> I don't like reading.<br> - Do you like books?<br> - I like words...<br> ...and letters...<br> ...but I'm not crazy about complete sentences.<br> Hmm.<br> So, what did he think?<br> He walked out on me, actually. I don't think David liked me very much.<br> I think he just didn't like happy endings.<br> Put your face here.<br> Great.<br> What are you doing? You're not gonna paint me, are you?<br> I might put you in one of my paintings.<br> There's one that I want to do of an Icelandic hero.<br> He's a thief and he's made of fire.<br> - Hmm, but you might not like that.<br> - Why not?<br> Because you're in the movies...<br> ...and in the movies, you can't have thieves as heroes, can you?<br> I don't know about that. We have a long tradition of gangsters in the movies.<br> Oh, yes, but they always have to suffer for their crimes, don't they?<br> We should pay for our crimes, shouldn't we?<br> I don't know. Knowing that you've committed a crime is suffering enough.<br> If you don't suffer, maybe it wasn't a crime after all.<br> Anyway, what difference does it make?<br> It has nothing to do with how things really are.<br> You don't really believe that, do you?<br> [JUNE CHUCKLES]<br> I don't know what I believe, Mr. Mill.<br> That is just what I feel.<br> You know what you are, June whatever-your-name-is?<br> You're a pragmatic anarchist.<br> - Is that what I am?<br> - That's what you are.<br> I never was sure.<br> AVERY: Could I just pick this up? Yeah?<br> - Ooh, it's heavy!<br> - 37 ounces.<br> Really? Oh, look, look.<br> I wanna thank my mother, and her mother...<br> ...and her father's mother, who was the...<br> [GRIFFIN AND AVERY CHUCKLE]<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello. Ha, ha.<br> Meet Detective Susan Avery.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Hello.<br> - My partner.<br> - Willa Broom.<br> My pleasure. Let's go in here.<br> This is the first real movie studio Detective Avery's been to.<br> - GRIFFIN: Oh, really?<br> - AVERY: Well, aside from the Universal tour.<br> When my family comes in, I always take them out there.<br> Been out there so often, I kind of feel like I'm ready to direct.<br> WALTER: You'll probably do better than the film grads...<br> ...they're handing the cameras out to nowadays.<br> I'm sorry I didn't call you when I heard Kahane was dead.<br> - Heard or read?<br> - Read.<br> Why didn't you?<br> Walter asked me the same question. I wish I had a better answer for it...<br> ...but all I can say is that I didn't think about it.<br> Hmm.<br> - How did you know where he would be?<br> - His wife told me...<br> - ...he was seeing The Bicycle Thief.<br> - Girlfriend.<br> Girlfriend.<br> Girlfriend. I didn't know either of them.<br> I was feeling restless. I thought I'd go see the movie.<br> If he was there, I was gonna talk to him about a job he was good for.<br> AVERY: So you got to the theater, you saw him and...?<br> GRIFFIN: We went and had a drink at a Japanese place he knew about.<br> It was a wild, incredible scene. It was like Tokyo.<br> But he left before you did. Why didn't you leave together?<br> It was an incredible scene. I was having a great time.<br> Then why didn't you stay longer?<br> Well, the people stopped singing and then it was just a bar, and I don't drink.<br> - You drank with him.<br> - Well, when in Rome...<br> - Did you know him socially?<br> - No.<br> - Been to his house?<br> - No.<br> - Know anything about him personally?<br> - No.<br> Griffin. Guess we're gonna let you get back to work now.<br> - Something's bothering you. What is it?<br> - Well, I...<br> I just have to ask you, did you see him in the parking lot after you left?<br> No. I parked on the street.<br> I drive a Range Rover so I always feel safer when it's visible.<br> Out on the street, who's gonna smash a window?<br> Hmm.<br> If you had a shitty car, you would have been parked in the parking lot?<br> If I had a shitty car, I might be a dead man.<br> Somehow, I think you're a little too lucky for that.<br> Thank you.<br> - ASSISTANT: Okay.<br> - TOMLIN: Come on.<br> - ASSISTANT: Sixty-three, Take 3, mark.<br> - TOMLIN: Wait one second.<br> DIRECTOR: Now.<br> Action.<br> [GLENN CLEARS THROAT]<br> No, goddamn it, Peterson, you listen to me.<br> I been around a while. I got a nose. This situation stinks.<br> It stinks of The Company.<br> That's right, Peterson, the fucking CIA.<br> - You ever heard of it?<br> - LEVY: Lily understands.<br> It's the kind of operation those whiz-kid fucks...<br> You don't understand what he's going for.<br> - I guess I don't.<br> - I find it hard...<br> ...to listen to you when you don't understand.<br> - Would you shut up, please? Could you?<br> - Oh, kiss my ass.<br> LEVY: You can't even see anything.<br> I have to cut because my robe caught on the drawer.<br> - DIRECTOR: Oh, for chrissakes.<br> - TOMLIN: I couldn't help it.<br> - EXEC 1: I like this guy. He's great.<br> - EXEC 2: Scotty Glenn?<br> - What kind of water is that?<br> - EXEC 1: A cowboy, an FBI, priest, lover.<br> Can I have some Volvic, please?<br> - DIRECTOR: Action.<br> - No, goddamn...<br> LEVISON: I heard the police came to see you about this dead writer.<br> Who was this guy?<br> GRIFFIN: His name was David Kahane.<br> I never heard of him. Did we ever hire him for anything?<br> I was thinking about it.<br> He pitched me a story. I went out to talk to him about it.<br> - TOMLIN: I don't have to endure your mouth.<br> - Jesus.<br> Poor bastard. His ship is about to come in, some black kid wants his money for crack.<br> I'm sorry. I don't wanna criticize you, babe...<br> ...but I'm supposed to be having a conversation on the phone.<br> - TOMLIN: Are you talking to me?<br> - Are the cops still bothering you?<br> - DIRECTOR: Action.<br> - GRIFFIN: No. No, I don't think so.<br> LEVISON: Let Stuckel handle it. He'll give them a couple passes to a screening...<br> ...where they can sit two rows behind Michelle Pfeiffer. They'll leave you alone.<br> - Griffin?<br> - Yes.<br> Um, a guy named Joe Gillis called and he said he wants you to meet him...<br> ...at the St. James Club around 10:00 on the patio.<br> - Know who this is?<br> - Never heard of him.<br> - He said you'd know him.<br> - Anybody know who Joe Gillis is?<br> LEVISON: He's the character William Holden played in Sunset Boulevard.<br> The writer who gets killed by the movie star.<br> - BONNIE: Gloria Swanson.<br> - CELIA: That is a fantastic movie.<br> GLENN: All I know is we're doing this my way. I happen to think...<br> [GRIFFIN CHUCKLES]<br> That guy... Last week he said he was Charles Foster Kane.<br> Week before that it was Rhett Butler.<br> Why would they think that I'd kill my own sister's husband?<br> LEVY: You wanna compare grosses, Bonnie?<br> I was in love with him.<br> [SIREN WAILING]<br> Griffin?<br> - Griffin.<br> - Malcolm McDowell.<br> - Hi. How are you?<br> - Hi. Good to see you.<br> Listen, the next time you wanna badmouth me...<br> ...have the courage to do it to my face.<br> You guys are all the same.<br> [soft piano]<br> - CIVELLA: You love it there?<br> - I love it. It's just wonderful.<br> You love your career too, don't you? What is it, Tom?<br> A complete disaster. Look at what happened in Heaven's Gate with Cimino.<br> - It just ended.<br> - We both are concerned about your ca...<br> I knew an actor, I won't mention his name...<br> MacDOWELL: Where I live, I know how people think and how they feel.<br> - But it's Montana.<br> - Montana will end you.<br> - It ended Cimino on Heaven's Gate.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Griffin Mill.<br> - Hi. Andy Civella.<br> - Andy. How are you?<br> Hey, I've got Andie MacDowell sitting over here. You know her? She's so hot!<br> - Come over, meet her.<br> - Still living in New York?<br> Well, I couldn't live here. I'm allergic to happiness. Ha, ha.<br> - Andie, Griffin Mill.<br> - Hi, Andie.<br> - How are you?<br> - She's my namesake.<br> - How are the kids?<br> - CIVELLA: She's the smart Andie...<br> - ...and I'm the pretty one.<br> - He's wonderful. Thank you.<br> You geniuses know each other. Tom Oakley.<br> - Of course we do. Hi. How are you?<br> - Oh, yes. Hi, Tom.<br> Funny. I just ran into Malcolm McDowell in the lobby.<br> - Oh, really?<br> - Roddy McDowall...<br> ...is related to a cousin of my brother-in-law.<br> Well, I'm not related to either one of them.<br> [ALL CHUCKLE]<br> If I write it, I direct it.<br> The last three pictures you directed were bombs.<br> - One broke even.<br> - Bombs!<br> - Thank you for the drink.<br> - Worst of the bunch.<br> - I really have to go.<br> - You gotta go, Andie?<br> - Come on, let's go.<br> - We'll walk you to the car.<br> - No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.<br> - Hang on. Griffin.<br> Griffin, we'd like to buy you a drink.<br> - I am sorry. I can't.<br> - Have a drink.<br> - I'm meeting someone. Business.<br> - Should've told him...<br> - ...about Habeas Corpus.<br> - Of course, but he's busy.<br> - Is there anyone waiting for me?<br> - No one's asked.<br> Well, I'm expecting someone. I'll, uh, be out by the pool.<br> But he'll get back to us, right, Griffin?<br> - Griffin.<br> - Andie?<br> [CIVELLA WHISTLES]<br> [SIREN WAILING]<br> [HELICOPTER SOARING ABOVE]<br> - CIVELLA: Oh, sorry. Sorry, Griffin. Ha, ha.<br> - Jesus, Andy, it's you.<br> - Of course it's me.<br> - Listen, I can't ask you to join me.<br> - I told you, I'm meeting somebody.<br> - Yeah, you're meeting me.<br> - We got some big business.<br> - You? You?!<br> - Why not me?<br> - Jesus, Andy, you think this is funny?<br> - You think this is fucking funny?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Wouldn't she make a great Nora?<br> God, I'd love to write another Doll's House for her.<br> Oh, did you meet Tom Oakley?<br> Yes.<br> - You mean, you didn't call me?<br> - No, I didn't call you.<br> I'm sorry. I'm r-really sorry.<br> Listen. I really am meeting somebody.<br> There's no way I can hear a pitch right now.<br> - You'll have to call me tomorrow.<br> - No, I can't do it tomorrow.<br> [PAGER BEEPS]<br> I've got a meeting at Paramount.<br> - I've got a meeting at Universal, too.<br> - Congratulations.<br> If you don't hear it now, you'll lose it.<br> - Then I lose it, all right?<br> - It'll take 20 seconds.<br> - When your friend gets here...<br> - What friend? What are you talking about? Who?<br> Whoever you're gonna meet here.<br> Twenty-five words or less.<br> Absolutely. Tom, you... No, you sit here, Tom. Go.<br> OAKLEY: District attorney's at a moral crossroads...<br> - CIVELLA: Tom. Jesus Christ!<br> - OAKLEY: Okay. Okay, okay. Uh...<br> We open outside the largest penitentiary in California.<br> It's night, it's raining. A limousine comes in through the gate...<br> ...past a tight knot of demonstrators holding a candlelight vigil.<br> The candles under the umbrellas make them glow like Japanese lanterns.<br> That's nice. I haven't seen that before. That's good.<br> A lone demonstrator, a black woman, steps in front of the limousine.<br> The lights illuminate her like a spirit.<br> Her eyes fix upon those of the sole passenger.<br> The moment is devastating between them.<br> He's the DA, she's the mother of the person that's being executed.<br> You're good. See, I told you. He's good.<br> - GRIFFIN: Go on.<br> - OAKLEY: Okay.<br> The DA believes in the death penalty.<br> And the execution is a hard case. Black, 19 and definitely guilty.<br> We're in the greatest democracy in the world...<br> ...and 36 percent of the people on death row are black.<br> - Poor, disadvantaged black.<br> - More. More.<br> And he swears that the next person he sees to die...<br> ...is gonna be smart, rich and white.<br> - You, me, whoever.<br> - What a hook, huh?<br> - Beauty hook. Cut to the chase, Tom.<br> - Okay. Okay, okay.<br> Cut from the DA to an upmarket suburban neighborhood.<br> A couple have a fight.<br> He leaves in a fit, gets in a car. It's the same rainy night.<br> The car spins out on a road, goes into a ravine.<br> The body is swept away.<br> Now, when the police examine the car...<br> ...they find the brakes have been tampered with.<br> It's murder and the DA decides to go for the big one.<br> He's gonna put the wife in the gas chamber.<br> But the DA falls in love with the wife.<br> Of course he falls in love, but he puts her in the gas chamber anyway.<br> Then he finds out the husband is alive...<br> ...that he faked his death.<br> The DA breaks into the prison, runs down death row...<br> ...but he gets there too late.<br> The gas pellets have been dropped.<br> She's dead.<br> I'll tell you...<br> ...there's not a dry eye in the house.<br> - She's dead?<br> - OAKLEY: She's dead.<br> She's dead. Because that's the reality.<br> The innocent die.<br> - Who's the DA?<br> - Ah. No one.<br> - No one?<br> - "No stars on this project."<br> - We're going out on a limb on this one.<br> - You know, like unknown stage actors...<br> ...or maybe somebody English like what's-his-name.<br> OAKLEY: Mm-hm.<br> - Why?<br> - OAKLEY: Why? Why?<br> Because this story is just too damned important...<br> ...to risk being overwhelmed by personality.<br> Yeah, that's fine for action pictures, but this is special.<br> We want real people here.<br> We don't want people coming in with any preconceived notions.<br> - We want them to see a district attorney.<br> - Bruce Willis.<br> No. Not Bruce Willis, not Kevin Costner.<br> This is an innocent woman fighting for her life.<br> - Julia Roberts.<br> - GRIFFIN: If we can get her.<br> - CIVELLA: Of course we can get her.<br> - If I'm perfectly honest...<br> ...if I think about this, this isn't even an American film.<br> - It's not?<br> - OAKLEY: No, no. There are no stars.<br> No pat happy endings.<br> No Schwarzenegger, no stickups, no terrorists.<br> This is a tough story. A tragedy in which an innocent woman dies.<br> Why? Because that happens.<br> [PAGER BEEPS]<br> Habeas Corpus.<br> That's what we're calling it. "Produce the corpse."<br> What do you say? Yes or no?<br> That pitch was more than 25 words.<br> Yeah, but it's brilliant! What's the verdict, Griffin?<br> Mr Mill, for you.<br> - GRIFFIN: Who gave this to you?<br> - WAITER: I received it at the front desk.<br> OAKLEY: What is it?<br> It's, um...<br> It's from the person I was meeting. He's not coming.<br> Well, do we have a shot? Griffin.<br> It's an intriguing idea. Give me a call at the studio.<br> - CIVELLA: Yeah!<br> - There's a scene...<br> ...in Throne of Blood that has exactly the texture.<br> - Tom. Just say "thank you."<br> - If you wanna... Okay.<br> She has to die. No Hollywood ending.<br> - Tom, "thank you," say.<br> - God!<br> [PAGER BEEPS]<br> [CAR PHONE RINGS]<br> [RATTLING]<br> [TIRES SQUEAL AND HORNS HONKING]<br> [HORN HONKS]<br> Fuck you!

You gave me such a scare!<br> What are you doing here?<br> [CHUCKLES]<br> You gave me such a fright. Come in.<br> Come on in.<br> What's the matter? You look terrible.<br> What's up?<br> Sit down. I'll get you a drink.<br> Something happened?<br> Is it too late? I...<br> - No, no, no.<br> - Sorry.<br> It's not too late. No.<br> - I don't even know what time it is.<br> - What's wrong?<br> What are you painting? Is that me?<br> Yep. It's you.<br> See?<br> GRIFFIN: Do you have snakes in Iceland?<br> Snakes? No, I don't think so, no.<br> Are you afraid of snakes?<br> I don't know. I've never come close to a real one.<br> They scare the shit out of me.<br> - Here, have another.<br> - I don't usually drink.<br> Something happened tonight.<br> Yes, but, uh...<br> ...there's something else I have to tell you.<br> This isn't easy for me.<br> Yes?<br> How about if I just get on with my work...<br> ...and you talk to me when you feel like, okay?<br> I came very close to dying tonight.<br> All I could think about was you.<br> [JUNE SIGHS]<br> I don't even know you.<br> But you came into my mind...<br> ...and I couldn't... I couldn't think of anything else.<br> Remember that first night we spoke on the phone?<br> I was outside these windows...<br> ...watching you and, um...<br> It was so exciting and so...<br> ...new and...<br> ...strange.<br> I can't get you out of my mind.<br> Are you making love to me?<br> Yes, I guess I am.<br> I guess I am.<br> I wanna make love to you.<br> [softly] I wanna make love to you.<br> It's too soon.<br> It's too soon, isn't it?<br> It's so strange how things happen.<br> David was here...<br> ...then he left.<br> You arrived.<br> Maybe it's just the timing, but I feel like...<br> ...I would go anywhere with you...<br> ...if you asked.<br> But we mustn't hurry things.<br> You know, we can't hurry things any more than we can stop them.<br> I think you better go now.<br> I think I'm going to cry now.<br> Better go, quick.<br> I'm sorry.<br> No, no, no, don't be sorry. Just go home and...<br> ... get some sleep and...<br> ... call me.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Invite me on a proper date.<br> I'd like that.<br> GRIFFIN [OVER INTERCOM]: Jan?<br> - Jan!<br> - JAN: Yeah?<br> GRIFFIN: Get Larry Levy on the phone.<br> - JAN: I don't think he's on the lot.<br> - GRIFFIN: Try his car.<br> Isn't he at Fox?<br> He used to be. Not anymore.<br> I pitched him something a few months ago and he hated it.<br> - LEVY [OVER SPEAKER]: Yeah, Griffin.<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> Listen, I've got Tom Oakley...<br> ...and Andy Civella. I wouldn't be bothering you if I didn't...<br> ...think they had an idea you should hear.<br> - Hi, guys.<br> - CIVELLA: Hi, Larry.<br> Uh, the next voice you're gonna hear has got an English accent.<br> Tom Oakley. I'm Andy Civella.<br> Hi, Andy. I know Tom. How are you, Tom?<br> Uh, very well, Larry. And yourself?<br> Fine. What's your story?<br> We open outside San Quentin. It's night.<br> [MIMICS RAIN]<br> It's raining. A limousine enters through the front gate...<br> ...past a tight knot of demonstrators holding a candlelight vigil. The candles are...<br> ...flickering underneath the umbrellas, glowing like Japanese lanterns.<br> A lone demonstrator, black woman, steps in front of the limousine.<br> Her eyes connect with the lone passenger.<br> It's a devastating moment for both of them. Incredibly potent.<br> No stars, no Schwarzenegger, no pat Hollywood endings...<br> ...no car chases. This is an American tragedy...<br> ...in which an innocent woman dies.<br> Because that happens. That's reality.<br> LEVY [OVER SPEAKER]: Take me off the speakerphone, Griffin.<br> Yeah?<br> I don't know. It's a really hot story, but what is this bullshit, no stars?<br> Let me give you a little tip, Larry. Levison came to power on two movies.<br> They made $300 million and had no stars in them.<br> He's gonna love this idea. It'll remind him of his youth.<br> You know what his motto used to be? No stars, just talent.<br> - Has anyone else heard this?<br> - GRIFFIN: I don't think so. No.<br> We should make a deal now.<br> Tomorrow may be too late. Can we get ahold of Levison?<br> Yeah, I'll get Levison. Uh, when can you be back?<br> - I'll be there right after my AA meeting.<br> - Oh, Larry.<br> I didn't realize you, uh, had a drinking problem.<br> LEVY: Well...<br> ...I don't really, but that's where all the deals are being made these days. See you.<br> Tom, that was a hell of a pitch.<br> Good work. I think you sold Larry.<br> CIVELLA: Great. When are we gonna hear?<br> I want you to go home, put some champagne on ice.<br> I'll give you an answer by tonight.<br> - Jan, come in here!<br> - Griffin, you move in mysterious ways...<br> - ...but I like it. I like it.<br> - Okay.<br> Did Levy understand? No stars?<br> Yes, he was particularly attracted to that notion.<br> - No Hollywood ending?<br> - No Hollywood ending.<br> They looked happy.<br> They have a completely fucked-up idea that has no second act.<br> If I hadn't heard it myself, I never would have believed it.<br> Larry Levy liked it because he's a dick-brain.<br> Levy will sell the idea to Levison...<br> ...and then I will let Levison have the brilliant idea...<br> ...of letting Larry take over the project for me.<br> You will?<br> See, Levison can't wait to get in bed with Levy.<br> This piece-of-shit idea will blow up in both their faces.<br> And then I will step in and save the day.<br> - GAME VOICE: Score!<br> - Yes!<br> Three points.<br> Great shot.<br> She's receiving the last rites.<br> The DA discovers that the husband faked his own death.<br> She's innocent. He races to the penitentiary, but it's too late.<br> The pellets have dropped. She's dead.<br> He helped kill the woman he loved.<br> - Who are the stars?<br> - No stars, just talent.<br> No stars?<br> What kind of ending do you call that? It's depressing. It'll bring everybody down.<br> Depressing? Joel, what about Terms of Endearment?<br> Love Story? Steel Magnolias?<br> E.T. Grossed what? What, Marty?<br> Three hundred nineteen million dollars. There wasn't a dry eye in the house.<br> - Depressing? I don't think so.<br> - Yeah, but...<br> Listen. Normally I'd agree, but this is an entirely different deal.<br> It is a matter of taking a risk.<br> Rolling the dice.<br> But if they come up seven, bingo.<br> It's Oscar time.<br> - Do they screw?<br> - Who?<br> The DA, whoever it is, and the woman. Do they screw?<br> If I'm looking at jail cells and gas chambers, we're gonna have sex in this picture.<br> Sure, of course. We'll get it there. No problem.<br> Okay. Who's gonna shepherd this thing?<br> Larry, you have a good feel for this. You wanna run with it?<br> Wait. This project originated with Griffin.<br> - Bonnie.<br> - Oh, no. I don't wanna dance...<br> ...in somebody else's wedding. If it's Griffin's project, it's Griffin's project.<br> - BONNIE: I just think we should write...<br> - LEVISON: Bonnie, this'll have to be my call.<br> It's fine with me.<br> My plate is full anyway. Larry, it's yours.<br> Hit a home run. Win an Oscar for the home team.<br> - I've got something else for you.<br> - Yeah?<br> - New York tomorrow.<br> - Yeah?<br> Tom Wolfe's book will be at the Sherry-Netherlands.<br> - Read it, make your bid.<br> - Send Bonnie.<br> She'll know if it's a movie. If it is, bid a million.<br> - Me?<br> - A million? Oh, that's kind of high, isn't it?<br> [PHONE RINGS]<br> - It's Tom Wolfe. Why not you?<br> - LEVISON: Yeah?<br> I'm a story editor. That's a vice president's job.<br> - You don't wanna be vice president?<br> - LEVISON: Bonnie. Pack your bags.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - LEVISON: Yeah?<br> That was the most amazing pitch I've ever heard.<br> - If you don't want the responsibility, it's fine.<br> - No, I'm going.<br> I really wanna be one of your soldiers.<br> I'm glad you're on the team, believe me.<br> - Thank you for the support.<br> - Bonnie's gonna be gone. I'm here.<br> Whitney, now!<br> Frank, Marty. You wanna come in?<br> - BONNIE: May I have a word?<br> - I have a meeting.<br> - Find the time. What is going on?<br> - What do you mean?<br> I mean, handing Larry Levy your project like that.<br> Well, I just thought Larry had...<br> ...a firm grasp on...<br> - ...the style of the piece.<br> - The only thing Levy...<br> ...has a firm grasp on is his dick. You know it.<br> I'm not Oz. I can't do everything.<br> If Larry has what it takes to get a picture made, why not use him?<br> - Everybody wins.<br> - Why bullshit me?<br> - I'm not bullshitting you.<br> - Yes, you are. Griffin, I know you.<br> I know you. You've been stringing me along...<br> - Habeas Corpus, Griffin.<br> - Habeas Corpus.<br> Habeas Corpus.<br> You've been stringing me along like one of your writers.<br> What is this, getting Levison to send me? What is that?<br> - Are you trying to get rid of me?<br> - Get rid of you?<br> I'm trying to help you. If you score in New York...<br> ...Levison has to make you a vice president.<br> Jesus, Bonnie, what's the matter? Are you afraid of success?<br> - Are you seeing someone else?<br> - Oh. That's what this is about?<br> - It's not just this.<br> - Jesus.<br> It's a lot of things. The way you've been acting.<br> Something is going on. I wanna know what it is.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> - You're not even...<br> You're not even looking at me when you're talking.<br> I want you to look at me. Please look me right in the eyes and just tell me.<br> No bullshit. Is there someone else?<br> No.<br> Have a good trip.<br> [lively TV theme]<br> LEEZA GIBBONS: Our top story this evening involves Hollywood's three favorite G's.<br> A glamorous, glitzy, gala night on the town.<br> It is a who's who of stars, no IDs necessary.

Have a seat, Mr. Mill.<br> Listen, um, before we start, I just...<br> Paul went to see a movie last night he came in here raving about.<br> Paul, what was the name of that movie?<br> Changed the lady into a chicken at the end. What did you see?<br> - Freaks.<br> - Freaks.<br> - Have you seen this?<br> - Tod Browning. Yes.<br> "One of us, one of us, one of us, one of us."<br> He came in doing that. He was raving about it.<br> He loved it. He loved it. It was thrilling for me. Um, Willa. Excuse me.<br> Did you happen to see where the tampons went that were in here?<br> - Because I can't seem to find them.<br> - I didn't take them.<br> Who took them? Did he?<br> - I don't know.

Um...<br> No. Uh, you're putting me in a terrible position here.<br> I would hate to get the wrong person arrested.<br> Oh, please. This is Pasadena. We do not arrest the wrong person.<br> That's L.A. See, L.A., they kick your ass and then they arrest you.<br> That's what they do. We don't do that. Remember last year?<br> What was that guy's name? They put him on the tape. Who was that?<br> - King.<br> - AVERY: That's right, King.<br> - DELIVERY MAN: BLT.<br> - He was the wrong guy.<br> - Do you have a witness?<br> - Now, I can't answer that.<br> Well, either you have a witness or these are suspects in similar murders.<br> Mr. Mill, have you been going to detective school?<br> No, actually, we're doing a movie right now called The Lonely Room. Scott Glenn...<br> - ...plays a detective like you.<br> - Is he a black woman?<br> - GRIFFIN: No.<br> - Don't give me turkey.<br> - Lily Tomlin's in that? I heard about that.<br> - Actually I was drawing a comparison...<br> ...not based on race or gender.<br> Speaking of which, did you go out with, uh, June, uh...?<br> What is that woman's name?<br> Gudmundsdottir.<br> Ha. What is it? Who? Spell it for me.<br> G-U-D-M-U-N-D-S-D-O-T-T-I-R.<br> AVERY: Well, that really helps.<br> Could you...? Uh, did you go out with June...?<br> - GRIFFIN: Gudmundsdottir.<br> - Yeah. Her. Last night?<br> Yes, I did.<br> You guys known each other a long time?<br> No, I spoke to her for the first time the night Kahane was killed.<br> Wow.<br> - So you didn't know her before this?<br> - No, I didn't.<br> We met over the phone.<br> We got to talking, one thing led to another.<br> You fuck her?<br> - What kind of question is that?<br> - I think it's pretty direct. Did you fuck her?<br> I wouldn't answer that question without a lawyer in the room.<br> Then I probably wouldn't even answer that question.<br> Why don't you ask your friend? He's been following me.<br> - He'll probably know.<br> - All right.<br> Paul, did Mr. Mill fuck June Hudmuuhunta?<br> I didn't see him.<br> - See, you got away with it. He didn't see you.<br> - What are you implying?<br> I'm not implying anything. I asked you a direct question. Did you fuck...<br> I told you I wouldn't answer that without a lawyer.<br> - Why you getting hot under the collar?<br> - 'Cause you're being rude, Miss Avery.<br> Oh, well, excuse me.<br> But I think it's kind of soon for her to be gallivanting in the streets with you.<br> I'm there for her as a friend, Miss Avery.<br> - Mm.<br> - Why don't you call her?<br> I'm sure she'll be happy to pick over the horror of what's happened...<br> ...and tell you how we became friends.<br> What is this, fucking Iran?<br> Since when does the state tell us how long, and with whom we can share our grief?<br> [ALL CHUCKLE]<br> Or do you hold June Gudmundsdottir...<br> ...to a special code of conduct reserved for women?<br> [ALL LAUGHING]<br> What the fuck are you laughing at?<br> It's just, just...<br> - I'd like to talk to my lawyer.<br> - AVERY: Oh, my God.<br> - DeLONGPRE: "One of us. One of us."<br> - AVERY: Can't even say the bitch's name!<br> DeLONGPRE: "One of us. One of us. One of us."<br> WALTER: It's time for you to get yourself a real good lawyer.<br> I had a drink with the guy, Walter.

Mom and Dad are fighting.<br> Guys, have your lawyer give me a call.<br> - You've got a deal.<br> - ERIC & CARL: Yes!<br> Let's get out before he changes his mind.<br> We have witnesses.<br> Have a good trip.<br> MAN [OVER LOUDSPEAKER]: The white zone is for immediate loading...<br> ...and unloading of passengers only.<br> No parking.<br> Do not leave your car unattended due to the current security alert.<br> All unattended cars may be towed away immediately.<br> For your safety...<br> - Uh, did you bring your passport?<br> - Yeah.<br> You wanna hear something funny?

My studio can only say yes 12 times a year.<br> And collectively, we hear about 50,000 stories a year.<br> So it's hard.<br> And... I guess sometimes I'm not nice...<br> ...and make enemies.<br> And that's what I was to David.<br> Enemy.<br> Was his story one of the 12?<br> No, it wasn't.<br> Why?<br> It lacks certain elements that we need to market a film successfully.<br> What elements?<br> Suspense, laughter, violence.<br> Hope, heart.<br> Nudity, sex.<br> Happy endings.<br> Mainly happy endings.<br> What about reality?<br> You're not from Iceland, are you?<br> Did I say that?<br> Hmm.<br> Why don't you put me in the hot springs and see if I melt?<br> [water bubbles]<br> [MOANING AND PANTING]<br> Mmm.<br> GRIFFIN: I love you.<br> JUNE: I know.

Just get there.<br> - I'll be there.<br> - Griffin, this is a tough one.<br> Good luck.<br> [DIAL TONE]<br> Thanks.<br> WALTER: Mr. Mill, the studio's very upset about the publicity this might generate.<br> But I'll handle the press, the police, the judge and the witness.<br> Mr. Mill. Thank you for coming down without a fight.<br> It's in your best interest. You sleep in that suit?<br> GIRARD: Mill, get away from that woman. She's the enemy.<br> - Follow me.<br> - Susan, I had a lovely time at the Mint.<br> I can't believe you remembered it.<br> Mr. Mill, Gar Girard. I'm here to represent you.<br> Dick Mellen called me in on this. Here's the situation.<br> They've got a witness. They want you to do a lineup.<br> If you say no, they'll arrest you.<br> And even if you get identified, I'll get you off on bail.<br> Now, this witness lives across the street from the parking lot.<br> Even if she makes an identification, a positive ID right now...<br> ...even if that happens, it was very late at night. By the time I'm finished with her...<br> ...the world will have a new legal standard for blindness. Keep the faith...<br> This is just like they do it on television.<br> Excuse me, Susan.
