If I figured<br> I'd get caught, I'd be 1000 per cent wrong.<br> But if I didn't figure I'd get caught,<br> I wasn't jeopardising your job, man.<br> - Hey, don't you understand, Charlie?<br> - You fucking bastard.<br> - Hey!<br> - Keep your hands off me.<br> - Look what you did to my suit.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> What do you need a fancy suit for?<br> You got no job to wear it to, man.<br> - What did you say?<br> - Come on.<br> Huh? Say that again.<br> Say it again. Say it again.<br> Say... say what you just said again.<br> About my suit. Say what I don't need.<br> - Tell me what I don't need.<br> - What do you need a fancy suit for?<br> You got no job to wear it to, man.<br> That's right. Why?<br> Here's your button.<br> Come on, man. Hey, man, let's go watch<br> the sun come up like the old days.<br> Hey, Charluccio.<br> We'll sit and have a couple<br> of cognacs, like gentlemen.<br> Hey, let me tell you something.<br> I don't have time to sit<br> and watch the sun come up.<br> Capeesh? I don't have time.<br> I could teach another aerobics class.<br> There's some models<br> trying out for a commercial.<br> It would mean a few<br> extra dollars next week.<br> Great. Oh, Wallach's wants 300, or they're<br> gonna give it to a collection agency.<br> We can cut back a little too.<br> We eat out a lot more than we have to.<br> - You gonna cook?<br> - I can cook.<br> You can cook. You can't cook.<br> I don't fuckin' believe this.<br> She's got 11 months<br> worth of parking tickets here.<br> - The fuckin' bitch.<br> - Who?<br> Who? Cooky. Who else? Cooky.<br> She's still got the Buick in my name.<br> Goddamn it.<br> Let her pay them. It's only fair.<br> How can you say "Let her pay"? Every<br> penny that she gets comes from me.<br> Jesus Christ! It's almost two grand.<br> She must be parking<br> on the fuckin' sidewalk.<br> Take the car back.<br> She got three brothers who belong in<br> a zoo. They'll start a war over that thing.<br> - So what are you gonna do?<br> - I'll manage.<br> So what are you talking about, then?<br> Why you bein' such a cooze, huh?<br> Was that an accident?<br> Huh? Was that an accident?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> Why did you do that?<br> I'm sorry.<br> You can hit.<br> Finding a job will pick you up.<br> - You'll get your reflexes back.<br> - I think I already have my reflexes back.<br> The summer wind<br> Came blowin' in<br> From across the sea<br> It lingered there<br> To touch your hair<br> And walk with me<br> All summer long<br> We sang a song<br> And then we strolled that golden sand<br> Two sweethearts<br> And the summer wind<br> Like painted kites<br> Those days and nights<br> They went flyin' by<br> The world was new<br> Beneath a blue umbrella sky<br> Hey, Charlie Moran. How the hell are you?<br> - How you doing?<br> - What's happening, baby?<br> - I'm not doing any good in there.<br> - You know anybody who does?<br> - So what's happening? How's Cooky?<br> - Cooky's history.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - It's all right. Don't worry.<br> So, what's happening with you?<br> What are you doing?<br> - Waiting.<br> - You're waiting? For what?<br> - Work.<br> - I'm not gonna bullshit with you now.<br> I swear to God, business is off with me.<br> I'm down 35 per cent on my dinners.<br> You're up against a wall, I put you<br> on the floor a couple of shifts a week.<br> You work as a waiter, OK?<br> - Work as a waiter?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I look like a waiter to you?<br> - No. I'm offering you a job.<br> - You want to put me on as a waiter?<br> - Are you mad at me over this?<br> - I wouldn't work in your restaurant...<br> - Do me a favour. Go fuck yourself.<br> Fuckin' creep, you!<br> Maybe you should take a waiter's job<br> until somethin' better opens up.<br> Diane, give me a break, huh?<br> Just a thought.<br> You want me to save up<br> my little tip cup every night?<br> In 20 years, maybe I'll have<br> enough to own a place?<br> It's honest work, Charlie.<br> Somethin' I learned a long time ago<br> about honest work.<br> When people say they got honest work<br> for you, you know what they got?<br> - What?<br> - A shit job. That's what they got.<br> Do you ever think we don't have to own<br> the restaurant to move to the country?<br> You could find a job managing<br> a place. I could get work.<br> Diane, I'm not gonna head up<br> to Maine and start choppin' wood.<br> When we leave the city,<br> I'm gonna leave as an owner.<br> How are you gonna see your son<br> when you leave?<br> I'll work it out.<br> What's the sudden interest in my kid?<br> It's not sudden.<br> I'm curious. Doesn't it bother you<br> to only see Vinny once a week?<br> Yeah, it bothers me. Yeah.<br> It bothers me. When Cooky and I first split<br> up, I used to see the kid every other day.<br> I used to take him to the zoo.<br> I took him to the ferry.<br> - I dropped money at every Carvel stand.<br> - And?<br> And what? Then Cooky and her scumbag<br> brothers knocked me down all week long.<br> Bang, bang, bang. No mercy.<br> So by the time I got the kid,<br> I got nothin' but tight lips<br> and a frown all day.<br> It might be different if it was our kid.<br> Not at this point in my life.<br> I mean, you know.<br> You know, maybe down the road<br> sometime. But not right now.<br> Why not right now?<br> Because I got my back against<br> the wall right now. That's why.<br> I got no job. You want me<br> to put it a different way for you?<br> I'm outta work right now.<br> I got no money. Capeesh?<br> I got two Shylocks<br> I gotta carry on my back.<br> I got a marshal who wants to put a lien<br> on my salary, when and if I get a salary.<br> I got an ex-wife and I got a kid<br> I gotta feed every week.<br> Listen to you. You're always<br> saying I. "I got to...<br> Whoa, whoa! Don't play<br> games with me, all right?<br> - I'm not playing games.<br> - What do you wanna do? Fight?<br> - Shut up, dammit! Fuck off!<br> - Hey! What do you wanna do?<br> Look, I'm going to go begging<br> around the Village for a while, right?<br> I need a dose of sanity<br> in my life. Yeah, hey.<br> Charlie?<br> - Charlie!<br> - What? What do you want?<br> What do you want? What?<br> What do you want?<br> What? What do you want?<br> Speak. What do you want?<br> - I'm pregnant.<br> - Come over here.<br> Come over here. Come over here.<br> Come over here.<br> Come over here, right now.<br> Come over here, right now.<br> No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't<br> come over here. Don't come over here.<br> (Charlie) Grandpa had hundreds<br> of birds he kept up here on the roof.<br> He had all different kinds.<br> He had tipplets, he had flights,<br> he had tumblers, he had nuns...<br> You know what nuns are?<br> They're pigeons.<br> He had one of the most beautiful flocks<br> in the whole Village up here in this coop.<br> They had pigeon wars over these birds.<br> Grandpa stood up here with a stick.<br> He went like this to bring the birds home.<br> Hey, Vinny. Most of your grandfather's<br> time here was spent cleaning up bird shit.<br> It was.<br> Hey, Vinny.

It's<br> the only neighbourhood in the city<br> where little kids and old ladies<br> can still walk the streets at night.<br> Why the hell did Bed Bug<br> give us this one anyway?<br> It's a favour, I think.<br> "You can have the Irish", he told me.<br> "Keep it in the family."<br> Fuckin' humps. They're all alike.<br> They think they're real cute.<br> - There.

That's all that counts, no?<br> (Bunky) That was Bed Bug Eddie Grant.<br> It's September 21 st.<br> 11.25pm.<br> Heading for my monthly<br> pick-up on West Street.<br> From there, to Queens Village to deliver<br> the money to Inspector Ed Burns,<br> whose voice will be on this tape later on.<br> Hope to be erasing this<br> in Phoenix in about a year.<br> - This is a private club, pal.<br> - Well, I'd like to see Eddie Grant.<br> He's in the back room.<br> You're Charlie Moran?<br> You're one of the scumbags<br> that robbed my money.<br> You were brought up around here, no?<br> Carmine Street.<br> Same thing. And you know you owe<br> the neighbourhood some respect.<br> People steal from Eddie Grant,<br> it makes for a total breakdown.<br> No one knows right or wrong.<br> Before you know it,<br> you got mulenyams movin' in.<br> - What the hell brings you in here?<br> - A tape I took off a dead cop,<br> that'll hang you by your balls.<br> You walked in here to threaten me?<br> You're fuckin' right<br> I walked in here to threaten you.<br> The last time somebody talked to me<br> close to that was from the Village too.<br> I parcel-posted the scumbag home.<br> He didn't have the tape<br> that could put you away for 20.<br> OK, let me give you some advice.<br> You're behavin' like<br> a mammalucco. Capeesh?<br> You walk in here. You don't show the club<br> no respect. You're actin' like a scumbag.<br> You're half Irish,<br> so I make considerations.<br> I give you this for the tape.<br> I promised myself I'd wipe<br> my ass with this hand.<br> And nobody, nobody but the Pope<br> could walk out of here with his hand.<br> Mister, I am the Pope. This might<br> be your church, but right now,<br> I'm the Pope of Greenwich Village,<br> because I got a tape. All right?<br> I like you. You have balls.<br> I don't get too mad at that.<br> Coffee, Eddie?<br> Three sugars, Eddie?<br> I already put your sugar in, Charlie.<br> Lye! I filled his fuckin' espresso with lye!<br> - You got one shot. Run!<br> - What did you do? I had him.<br> What do you mean, what did I do?<br> I went all the way for you. Come on.<br> OK, walk slow and be cool.<br> - Great.<br> - Charlie, we got a shot here.<br> We got tickets for Miami.<br> Charlie, things could be<br> a hell of a lot worse.<br> I mean, we got $20,000 in our pocket.<br> Things are lookin' up.<br> - You got a serious thinking disorder.<br> - What are you talkin' about?<br> - What am I...? Yeah, things are lookin' up.<br> - Absolutely.<br> I had him. I had him, Paulie.<br> Charlie, what I done back there,<br> I done 100 per cent for you, man.<br> - For me, right. You tell me about it.<br> - And another thing - you need me, man.<br> Without me along, you'd be<br> nickel-and-diming it in ten minutes, man.<br> I'm the one with the moves. Absolutely.<br> The summer wind<br> Came blowin' in<br> From across the sea<br> It lingered there<br> To touch your hair<br> And walk with me<br> All summer long<br> We sang a song<br> And then we strolled that golden sand<br> Two sweethearts<br> And the summer wind<br> Like painted kites<br> Those days and nights<br> They went flyin' by<br> The world was new<br> Beneath a blue umbrella sky<br> Then softer than a piper man<br> One day it called to you<br> I lost you<br> I lost you to the summer wind<br> The autumn wind<br> And the winter winds<br> They have come and gone<br> And still the days<br> Those lonely days<br> They go on and on<br> And guess who sighs<br> His lullabies<br> Through nights that never end?<br> My fickle friend<br> The summer wind<br> The summer wind<br> Warm summer wind<br> Hm, the summer wind<br>
