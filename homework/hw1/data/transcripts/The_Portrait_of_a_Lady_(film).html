                        WOMAN: The best part of a kiss, I think,<br> is when you see that head coming towards you...<br> and you know that you're going to get kissed.<br> That moment just before is so exquisite.<br> Second Woman: I'd never felt the touch of another person my age.<br> The sensation flew through me.<br> Third Woman: I love it. I love kissing.<br> Fourth Woman: We were addicted to that being entwined with each other,<br> whether it was really positive or negative.<br> Fifth Woman: I get this intense look that says "I'm so mysterious,<br> "and there's so much more to me than meets the eye to find out..."<br> Sixth Woman: I believe in fate,<br> so that person will find me, or we'll find each other somehow.<br> SeVenth Woman: It means finding a mirror, the clearest mirror...<br> and the most loyal mirror,<br> so when I love that person, I know that they'll shine that back to me.<br> [TWIG SNAPS]<br> There's one thing more, Miss Archer.<br> You know, if you don't like Lockleigh,<br> if you think it's too damp or anything of that sort,<br> you need never go within 50 miles of it.<br> It's not damp, by the way. I've had the house thoroughly examined,<br> and it's perfectly safe, but if you shouldn't fancy it,<br> you needn't dream of living in it.<br> There's no difficulty about that.<br> I've plenty of houses.<br> I thought to let you know.<br> Some people don't like a moat, you know.<br> I adore a moat.<br> I'm very sure you know...<br> I don't go off easily...<br> but when I'm touched, it's for life, Miss Archer.<br> It's for life.<br> [DOGS BARKING]<br> Look, here comes Miss Archer.<br> WOMAN: No... She's going up to the house.<br> Second Woman: So she is. Where is Lord Warburton?<br> He was with her.<br> Bunchie, go back. Back.<br> [CROWD WHISPERING]<br> Shall I sit with you until dinner, Daddy?<br> I would like that, but Isabel has asked to talk with me.<br> [KNOCK ON DOOR]<br> Come in, my dear.<br> Do sit down. Hmm?<br> [COUGHS]<br> Ahem.<br> [COUGHS]<br> Uncle, I...<br> I ought to let you know that...<br> Lord Warburton has asked me to marry him.<br> Well!<br> I told you you'd be a success over here.<br> Americans are highly appreciated...<br> and you're very beautiful, you know.<br> Oh, yes, of course. I'm lovely.<br> I...<br> I know it seems tasteless and ungrateful...<br> but I can't marry him.<br> You didn't find his proposal sufficiently attractive?<br> It was attractive.<br> There was a moment when I would have given my little finger to say yes,<br> but...<br> I think I have to begin by getting a general impression of life.<br> Do you see?<br> And there's a light that has to dawn.<br> I can't explain it, but...<br> I know it's there.<br> I'm not afraid, you know.<br> He's a very fine man.<br> He earns 100,000 a year...<br> about half a dozen houses to live in...<br> and a seat in Parliament as I have one at my own dinner table.<br> Well...<br> I hope very much I have no more offers.<br> They upset me completely.<br> Isabel, your uncle is quite right.<br> You certainly cannot go to London without a proper escort.<br> Well, my friend Henrietta will be with me.<br> Your friend sounds rather bohemian,<br> and no doubt she will want to stay at a boarding house.<br> Ralph has put you down at his club.<br> With Ralph, you can go anywhere.<br> Isn't anything proper here?<br> You're too fond of your own ways, miss.<br> Yes, I'm very fond of them.<br> Isabel, I do not expect you to always heed my advice.<br> But as you have neither mother nor father,<br> I do expect you to listen to it.<br> Hup, hup, hup.<br> Shall I love your reporter friend or hate her?<br> Whichever you do will matter little to Henrietta.<br> She doesn't care a straw what men think of her.<br> - Will she interview me?<br> - You're not important enough.<br> Henrietta!<br> - So sad.<br> - Morbid, isn't it?<br> [WHISTLE BLOWS]<br> When I wrote to you from Liverpool,<br> I said I had something in particular to tell you.<br> You haven't asked me what it is yet.<br> Is it because you suspected?<br> Mmm... Suspected what?<br> What have you to tell me?<br> What I have to tell you is about your American admirer.<br> Mr Goodwood has come over on the steamer with me.<br> Oh!<br> You say that right.<br> He's come after you.<br> Did he tell you so?<br> No.<br> He told me... nothing.<br> - But I spoke of you a great deal.<br> - I'm sorry you did that.<br> Oh, no. It was a pleasure to me. I like the way he listened.<br> He was so quiet,<br> so intense.<br> He drank it all in.<br> He thinks too well of me already.<br> He oughtn't be encouraged.<br> He's dying for a little encouragement.<br> Shh!<br> I can see his face now.<br> And his look while we talked.<br> I... I've never seen an ugly man look so handsome.<br> He's very simple-minded...<br> and he's not so ugly.<br> Does your cousin go around all day with his hands in his pockets?<br> What does he do for a living?<br> He's terribly ill. He's quite unfit for work.<br> Don't you believe it.<br> I work when I'm sick.<br> I should like to show him up. He'd make a beautiful specimen.<br> Ralph: Daddy and I lived here when he worked at the bank.<br> We don't use it now.<br> I love this time of day, just as it gets dark.<br> Don't you?<br> - Ralph?<br> - Huh?<br> - May I light a cigarette?<br> - You may do what you please,<br> as long as you'll amuse me.<br> What had you in mind when you refused Warburton?<br> I have his leave to let you know he has told me.<br> Did...?<br> Did he ask you to talk to me?<br> No, not that. He...<br> told me because he couldn't help it.<br> We're old friends, and he was very heavy-hearted.<br> What had I in mind when I refused him?<br> What logic dictated so remarkable an act?<br> Why do you call it remarkable?<br> As a man, Warburton is hardly at fault.<br> I refused him because he was too perfect, then.<br> [SNIFFS]<br> If you've really given Warburton his final answer, I'm rather glad.<br> I don't mean I'm glad for you, and still less, of course, for him.<br> I'm glad for myself.<br> Are you thinking of proposing to me?<br> What I mean is that I shall have the thrill...<br> of seeing what a young lady does who won't marry Lord Warburton.<br> You asked about logic.<br> I'll tell you.<br> - It's that I can't escape my fate.<br> - Your fate?<br> It's not my fate to give up.<br> You call marrying Lord Warburton giving up?<br> It's getting a great deal, but it's giving up other chances.<br> Chances for what?<br> I don't mean chances to marry. I mean...<br> from life...<br> from the usual chances and dangers.<br> You've answered my question.<br> It seems to me I've told you very little.<br> You've told me the great thing.<br> The world interests you. You want to throw yourself into it.<br> - I never said that.<br> - You meant it. Don't repudiate it.<br> It's so fine.<br> [CROWD CHEERING]<br> Barker: There he is, the Great Santini.<br> Man: Go on. Pull!<br> Pull! Pull!<br> Cecil gont down there.<br> Barker: See the fantastic santini free himself.<br> How did you know I was here?<br> Miss Stackpole let me know.<br> That is not kind of her.<br> You said you hoped never to hear from me again. I know that.<br> But I never accepted any such rule as my own.<br> I didn't say I hoped never to hear from you.<br> Not for five years, then. Ten, twenty, it's the same thing.<br> What good do you expect to get by insisting?<br> I disgust you very much.<br> Yes.<br> You don't at all delight me.<br> You don't fit in, not in any way. Not now.<br> Think of me or not. Only leave me alone.<br> Until when?<br> For a year... or two.<br> Well, which? Between one year and two,<br> there's all the difference in the world.<br> Call it two, then.<br> You'll marry someone else as sure as I stand here.<br> I don't wish to be a mere sheep in the flock.<br> I shall probably never marry.<br> [WHISPERING] God.<br> If you hear it rumoured I'm near marrying, remember what I've said...<br> and doubt it.<br> I hate to lose sight of you.<br> Goodbye.<br> Hmm.<br> [SIGHS]<br> [MR. GOODWOOD WHISPERING] I love you.<br> You acted very wrongly.<br> You don't mean to tell me you've sent him off?<br> I asked him to leave me alone,<br> and I ask you the same, Henrietta.<br> If you marry one of these people,<br> I'll never speak to you again.<br> You better wait till I'm asked.<br> Oh, you'll be asked quick enough.<br> Annie Climber was asked three times in Italy.<br> Poor, plain, little Annie.<br> Well, if Annie Climber wasn't captured, why should I be?<br> Well, I don't believe Annie was pressed, but you'll be.<br> Do you know where you're going, Isabel Archer?<br> No, and it's very pleasant not to.<br> You're drifting off to some great mistake.<br> You make me shudder.<br> [MAN COUGHING]<br> My father's had an attack of his old malady.<br> It's quite severe, I'm afraid.<br> [COUGHS]<br> By great good luck, Dr Matthew Hope is in town,<br> and I shall make sure of his coming down to Gardencourt.<br> There's... an express train at 2.45,<br> and you shall come with me or not, as you prefer.<br> I shall go with you. I'll pack now.<br> [SIGHS]<br> I'm not at peace about Isabel.<br> I fear she may marry one of these Europeans, and I want to prevent it.<br> What a rage you have for organising people.<br> I simply want her to marry Mr Caspar Goodwood.<br> He's followed her all the way from Boston.<br> He was here, last night.<br> In Pratt's? [DISHES SHATTER]<br> Mmm. It was a little plot of mine.<br> Is she very fond of him?<br> If she isn't, she ought to be.<br> He's simply wrapped up in her.<br> Three months ago, she gave him every reason to suspect he was acceptable,<br> and it's not really of Isabel to go back on a friend...<br> simply because she's changed the scene.<br> Isabel... was cruel? [TAPPING GLASS]<br> She gave him no satisfaction.<br> Her only idea was to be rid of him.<br> Poor Mr Goodwood.<br> [DOGS BARKING]<br> [SILVERWARE CLINKING]<br> Sir Matthew, he had some kind of seizure last night,<br> but I feel a dreadful cold coming on.<br> - You will leave me a powder?<br> - Of course.<br> Oh, my great friend from Rome has arrived.<br> You will stay for tea?<br> [PIANO PLAYING]<br> It's very beautiful,<br> and your playing makes it more beautiful still.<br> You don't think I disturbed Mr Touchett, then?<br> His room is so far away, and I play just...<br> just un peu des doigts.<br> No, I... I should think that to hear such lovely music...<br> would make him feel better.<br> I'm afraid there are moments in life...<br> when even Schubert has nothing to say to us.<br> Would... would you play something more?<br> If it will give you pleasure, delighted.<br> [MUSIC STARTS]<br> [MUSIC STOPS]<br> Are you the niece, the young American?<br> - I'm my aunt's niece.<br> - C'est bon. We're compatriots.<br> I'm Madame Merle.<br> [MUSIC STARTS]<br> [DOG PANTING]<br> [LIGHTLY SNORES]<br> Mmm.<br> [DOOR CLOSES]<br> Who's that with me?<br> Is it my son?<br> Yes, it's your son, Daddy.<br> - Is there no one else?<br> - No one else.<br> Cigarette.<br> What you should do when I'm gone...<br> is to marry.<br> What do you think of your cousin?<br> Do I... do I understand you to propose that I should marry Isabel?<br> Well, that's what it comes to in the end.<br> Don't you like Isabel?<br> Yes, very much. I like Isabel very much.<br> - I've thought a great deal about it.<br> - So have I.<br> I don't mind telling you that.<br> You're in love with her, then?<br> I should think you would be. It's as if she came over on purpose.<br> No, I'm not in love with her, but...<br> I should be, if... certain things were different.<br> Things are always different from what they might be.<br> I shall not live many years...<br> but I hope long enough to see what Isabel does with herself.<br> I should like to do something for her.<br> - I should like to make her rich.<br> - What do you mean by rich?<br> I call people rich...<br> when they're able to meet the requirements of their imagination.<br> To do what she likes with it?<br> Absolutely what she likes.<br> Good boy.<br> [GRR]<br> [GRR]<br> You win.<br> Down.<br> Who is this Madame Merle?<br> She's very charming.<br> She plays beautifully.<br> - She does everything beautifully.<br> - You don't like her.<br> On the contrary, I was once in love with her.<br> And she didn't care for you?<br> That's why you don't like her?<br> How can we have discussed such things?<br> Monsieur Merle was then living.<br> Is he dead now?<br> So she says.<br> Don't you believe her?<br> Yes, because...<br> the husband of Madame Merle would be likely to pass away.<br> Mme. Merle: Am I late?<br> I do apologise.<br> No, not at all.<br> Are you aware of the beautiful walking paths round the estate?<br> Mme. Merle: Americans certainly make poor Europeans.<br> We've no natural place here.<br> But a woman, it seems to me, has no natural place anywhere.<br> Wherever she finds herself, she must stay on the surface,<br> and more or less crawl.<br> I shall never crawl.<br> Yes. On the whole, I don't see you crawling.<br> But the men, the Americans?<br> Look at poor Ralph Touchett.<br> What sort of figure do you call that?<br> Fortunately, he has consumption.<br> I say fortunately because it gives him something to do.<br> His consumption's his... carriere.<br> It's a kind of position.<br> If he were not ill, he'd do something.<br> He'd take his father's place in the bank.<br> I doubt it. He's not at all fond of the bank.<br> - Are you not good friends?<br> - Perfectly!<br> But he doesn't like me.<br> What have you done to him?<br> Nothing whatever,<br> but one has no need of a reason for that.<br> For not liking you? I think one has need of a very good reason.<br> Ah. I love the English rain.<br> There's always a little of it and never too much at once.<br> Never wet, and it always... smells good.<br> [SNIFFS] Ah, delicious!<br> Mmm, delicious!<br> Mmm, it is!<br> I'd give a good deal to be your age again,<br> to have my life before me.<br> Your life's before you yet.<br> No. The best part's gone, and gone for nothing.<br> Oh, surely not for nothing.<br> Why not? What have I got?<br> Neither husband nor child nor fortune.<br> Nor even a house of my own.<br> What should you like to do that you've not done?<br> I'm very ambitious.<br> To me, you're the vivid image of success.<br> My dreams were so... great.<br> I should make myself ridiculous by talking of them.<br> I should like you to have this.<br> I am going to six places in succession,<br> and I shall meet no one I like so well as you.<br> Ahem.<br> [YAWNS]<br> He has left me this house, but naturally, I shall not live in it.<br> I have a much better one in Florence, as you know.<br> And Ralph gets Gardencourt.<br> Serena, there is one remarkable clause in my husband's will.<br> I'll ring for tea?<br> He has left my niece a fortune.<br> - A fortune?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Isabel steps into something like 70,000.<br> The clever creature.<br> Man: She seems to me very genteel.<br> She's really pretty.<br> When her mother died, I sent her to see what you'd make of her.<br> I had faith, you know.<br> She's perfect. She has no faults.<br> We've had her since she was so small.<br> - It's not certain you'll lose her.<br> - Monsieur,<br> good as she is, she's not one of us.<br> She's made for the world.<br> Nothing's settled yet.<br> - Buon giorno.<br> - Buon giorno.<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Si.<br> It's only the colour that's different, Mama.<br> There are just as many in one bunch as in the other.<br> Grazie.<br> Is there someone here?<br> Yes, there is. Someone you may see.<br> - Madame Merle.<br> - I've come to welcome you home.<br> May I not go to the carriage?<br> It would please me better if you'd remain with me.<br> I do hope they see that you wear gloves.<br> Little girls usually dislike them.<br> I used to dislike them, but I like them now.<br> I'll make you a present of a dozen.<br> - And will they be very pretty?<br> - Not too pretty.<br> She's going to give me some gloves.<br> You're very kind to her. But she's supposed to have everything she needs.<br> I'd think she's had enough of the nuns.<br> If we're discussing that matter, she'd better go out of the room.<br> Let her stay. We'll talk of something else.<br> Go into the garden, mignonne, and pluck a flower for our friend?<br> That's just what I want to do.<br> [DOOR CLOSES]<br> There's something I should like you to do in Florence.<br> There's a friend of mine I want you to know.<br> What good will that do me?<br> It will amuse you.<br> [FAKE LAUGH]<br> Oh, if only I could induce you to make an effort.<br> Ah, I knew something tiresome was coming.<br> What in the world that's likely to show up here is worth an effort?<br> Don't be foolish, Osmond.<br> The person I came to Florence to see.<br> She's a niece of Mrs Touchett.<br> She's young, 23 years old. I met her in England six months ago.<br> I like her immensely.<br> And I do what I don't do every day, I...<br> admire her.<br> You'll do the same.<br> Not if I can help it.<br> You won't be able to help it.<br> Is she beautiful, clever, rich, splendid,<br> universally intelligent, unprecedentedly virtuous?<br> It's only on those conditions that I care to make her acquaintance.<br> I know plenty of dingy people. I don't want to know any more.<br> Miss Archer isn't dingy.<br> She fills all your requirements.<br> More or less, of course.<br> No. Quite literally.<br> What do you want to do with her?<br> What you see. Put her in your way.<br> Isn't she meant for something better than that?<br> I don't pretend to know what people are meant for.<br> I only know what I can do with them.<br> I'm sorry for Miss Archer.<br> If that's the beginning of interest in her, I take note of it.<br> You're looking very well.<br> You never look so well as when you've got an idea.<br> They're always becoming to you.<br> I wish very much you were not so heartless.<br> It's always been against you, and it will be against you now.<br> I'm not so heartless as you think.<br> Every now and then something... touches me.<br> As for instance, your ambitions for me.<br> Why would you think Mrs Touchett's niece should matter to me when...<br> ...I myself have mattered so little?<br> That is not what I meant to say, of course.<br> When I have known and appreciated such a woman as you.<br> Isabel Archer is better than I.<br> Have you seen my latest?<br> Isn't that one of last year's sketches?<br> The one you did in Spain?<br> I've made improvements since then.<br> I don't care for your drawings.<br> They're much better than other peoples'.<br> But as the only thing you do, it's so little.<br> I should have liked you to do so many other things. I had my ambitions.<br> - Things that were impossible.<br> - Things that were impossible.<br> Your room, at least, is perfect.<br> I'm struck with that afresh whenever I come back here.<br> You've such adorable taste.<br> I'm sick of my adorable taste.<br> You must let Miss Archer come and see it.<br> As cicerone of your museum, you appear to particular advantage.<br> Did you say she was rich?<br> There's no doubt whatever about her fortune.<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [BELL RINGS]<br> Do you think it good for me to be made so rich?<br> Henrietta doesn't.<br> Oh, hang Henrietta. If you ask me, I'm delighted at it.<br> Did you know your father intended to leave me so much money?<br> What does it matter? My father was very obstinate.<br> So you did know?<br> Yes, he told me.<br> How did he know I'll make good uses of a large fortune?<br> How did he know I'm not weak?<br> Don't ask yourself so much whether this or that is good for you.<br> Live as you like best, and your character will take care of itself.<br> I wonder if you know what you say.<br> If you do, you take a great responsibility.<br> [GIGGLES]<br> [BELL RINGS]<br> The facade is 16th century, but the interior is much older.<br> [WOMAN SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> I must tell you that Osmond doesn't often invite me.<br> It was quite my own idea, coming today.<br> I like to see new people, and I'm sure you're very new.<br> Oh! But don't sit there.<br> That chair's not what it looks.<br> There are very good seats here, but there are also some horrors. Pipi.<br> Isabel: I don't see any horrors anywhere.<br> Everything seems to me beautiful and precious.<br> Thank you. I've a few good things.<br> Indeed, I've nothing very bad.<br> Poor Osmond with his old curtains and crucifixes.<br> Won't you have some tea? You must be very tired.<br> No, I'm not tired. What have I done to tire me?<br> You'll be tired when you go home<br> if he shows you all his bibelots...<br> and gives you a lecture on each.<br> Then I'll have learned something.<br> Oh, well, for me, one should like a thing or not,<br> but one shouldn't try to reason it out.<br> Some very good feelings...<br> may have very bad reasons, don't you know?<br> It's a lovely day. Shall we go for a walk?<br> Oh! And then there are some very bad feelings that have very good reasons.<br> This hill of my brother's is impossible.<br> It's terrible to hear one's horses wheeze.<br> What do you think of my sister?<br> Don't ask me that, I-I...<br> I've seen your sister too little.<br> Yes, it's true, you've seen her very little,<br> but I should like to know how she strikes a fresh, unprejudiced mind.<br> I sometimes think we've gotten into a rather bad way,<br> living here amongst people and things not our own.<br> My sister's rather unhappy, and as she's not of a serious turn,<br> she doesn't tend to show it tragically, but comically instead.<br> Shall I take that painting down? You'll want more light.<br> This is one of the first paintings I bought when I came to Italy.<br> I've seen the girl but this once, I like her very much.<br> So do I.<br> You have a strange way of showing it.<br> I advise you not to agitate yourself.<br> The matter concerns three persons stronger in purpose than yourself.<br> Three persons? You and Osmond, of course.<br> But is Miss Archer also very strong?<br> Quite as much so as we.<br> You're capable of anything, you and Osmond.<br> - You're dangerous.<br> - Better leave us alone, then.<br> Madame Merle spoke of you having some plan of going around the world?<br> I'm rather ashamed of my plans.<br> I make a new one every day.<br> I don't think you should be ashamed. It's the greatest of pleasures.<br> I made a plan years ago and I'm acting on it today.<br> Must have been a very pleasant one.<br> Mmm, it was. Very simple.<br> It was to be as quiet as possible.<br> As quiet?<br> Not to worry, not to strive nor struggle.<br> To content myself with little.<br> I've spent many years here on that plan,<br> and been not at all unhappy.<br> It polishes me up a bit to talk to you.<br> But you'll be gone before I see you three times.<br> That's what it is to live in a country that people come to.<br> Have you had the opportunity to wander in Florence at all?<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> Serena, you know everything.<br> Is that curious creature making love to my niece?<br> Gilbert Osmond?<br> Heaven help us, that's an idea.<br> It hadn't occurred to you? Hmm?<br> He's called five times in the course of a fortnight.<br> You make me feel an idiot, but I confess it hadn't.<br> I wonder if it has occurred to Isabel?<br> I shall ask her.<br> Don't put it in her head. The thing would be to ask Mr Osmond.<br> I cannot. I'll not have him inquire of me with that air of his.<br> I'll ask him myself.<br> I'll investigate and report to you.<br> She'd marry him for the beauty of his opinions...<br> or his autograph of Michelangelo.<br> [MAN SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> Excuse me.<br> Which day is that?<br> She wants me to go to Caparola with her.<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> To go with her?<br> To be there while she's there.<br> She proposed it. Of course, I gave her the chance.<br> I rejoice to hear it, but don't cry victory too soon.<br> Of course you'll go.<br> It makes me work, this idea of yours.<br> Don't pretend you don't enjoy it.<br> You've made a very good impression. And I can see you've received one.<br> You've not come to Mrs Touchett's so often to oblige me.<br> The girl's not disagreeable. She has only one fault.<br> - What's that?<br> - Too many ideas.<br> I warned you she was clever.<br> Fortunately, they're very bad ones.<br> - Why is that fortunate?<br> - No loss if they must be sacrificed.<br> You're unfathomable.<br> I'm frightened at the abyss into which I've cast her.<br> You can't draw back now. You're in too far.<br> Very good.<br> But you must do the rest yourself.<br> It's incredible. There's so much work,<br> and they would have been paid a pittance for it.<br> I forgot my parasol. I must go back.<br> - I'll get it.<br> - No, it's fine.<br> - Do you want some caff?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> Oh!<br> So you decided to come?<br> Mm-hmm. I came last night.<br> Hmm.<br> The others are up above.<br> I didn't come here for the others.<br> I came to say goodbye.<br> Who knows if you'll come back? You're under no obligation to.<br> - You think my travels ridiculous?<br> - No.<br> Go everywhere, do everything.<br> Be happy, be triumphant.<br> - What do you mean by triumphant?<br> - Well, doing what you like.<br> Doing all the vain things one likes may be tiresome.<br> Exactly. And you'll be tired someday.<br> I don't know whether I'd better not wait until then...<br> for something I want to say to you.<br> I can't advise you without knowing what it is.<br> But I'm horrid when I'm tired.<br> I don't believe that.<br> You're angry sometimes, that I can believe,<br> but I'm sure you're never horrid.<br> Not even when I lose my temper?<br> You don't lose your temper, you find it. And that must be beautiful.<br> If only I could find it now.<br> I'm not afraid.<br> I should fold my arms and admire you.<br> What I wish to say is that I find I'm in love with you.<br> Oh... No, that had better wait.<br> No. You may heed it now or never, as you please.<br> But after all, I must say it.<br> I'm absolutely in love with you.<br> Don't say that, please.<br> It will not matter to you.<br> I have neither fame nor fortune, so I offer nothing.<br> I think I'm glad that we're separating.<br> If you weren't going away, you'd know me better.<br> I shall do that some other time.<br> There's one thing more, a little service I should like to ask.<br> I'm going to Rome for a few days.<br> Would you visit my daughter before you leave Florence?<br> Yes, of course.<br> Oh...<br> Henrietta: Hello? Hello?<br> Isabel, are you down there?<br> We've got your coffee waiting!<br> Hello? Can you see her down there?<br> - Ralph: It's dark.<br> - Hello?<br> Oh, hello.<br> I think they're the most beautiful gardens in the world.<br> Not that I've been everywhere in the world.<br> Pap says while he's away, I'm not to go beyond this line.<br> Your father says that?<br> He thinks I will get scorched.<br> Hmm.<br> Here... share my parasol.<br> What is it?<br> No, you're right to do as your father says.<br> He'll never ask you anything unreasonable.<br> Want tea?<br> Isabel: There it is!<br> Serena: "Nine, ten. Excuse me." "No, no, no."<br> Osmond: "What I wish to say is that...<br> "I'm absolutely in love with you."<br> [Repeating] "I'm absolutely in love with you... in love with you."<br> Osmond: "I'm absolutely in love with you."<br> Isabel: "Absolutely in love with you.<br> "I'm absolutely in love with you."<br> Osmond: "I'm absolutely in love with you.<br> "Absolutely in love with you."<br> Isabel: "I'm absolutely in love with you."<br> Osmond: "I'm absolutely in love with you."<br> Osmond and Isabel: "I'm absolutely in love with you."<br> Isabel: Oh, oh, oh...<br> [WORKERS SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> I can't tell you how I hoped you wouldn't come.<br> I've no doubt of that.<br> I gave you forewarning I'd do as I choose.<br> I wanted to hear your explanation of you having changed your mind.<br> An explanation?<br> - Do you think I'm bound to explain?<br> - You were very positive.<br> I did believe it.<br> I've not deceived you.<br> I was perfectly free.<br> When I had your letter, I thought there might be some mistake.<br> There's no mistake whatever.<br> Well... I've done what I wished.<br> I've seen you.<br> Do you mean you came simply to look at me?<br> [DOOR CLOSES]<br> [RALPH COUGHS IN THE DISTANCE]<br> [COUGHING]<br> [COUGHING]<br> You didn't come up for lunch.<br> [CLEARING THROAT]<br> I'm not hungry.<br> You ought to eat. You live on air.<br> [CONTINUES COUGHING]<br> I haven't congratulated you.<br> I wondered why you were silent.<br> I hardly got over my surprise since my mother told me.<br> You're the last person I expected to see caught.<br> I don't see why you call it "caught".<br> [COUGHING]<br> Because you're going to be put into a cage.<br> If I like my cage, that needn't trouble you.<br> [WHEEZING]<br> [CLEARING THROAT]<br> [COUGHING]<br> I'd treated myself... [COUGH]<br> To a charming vision of your future.<br> I'd amused myself with planning out high destiny for you.<br> There was to be nothing of this sort in it.<br> You were not to come down so easily or so soon.<br> "Come down"?<br> It hurts me.<br> Hurts me as if I'd fallen myself.<br> I don't understand you.<br> I should have said...<br> the man for you would have had a more...<br> active, larger...<br> freer sort of nature.<br> I can't get over the sense that Osmond is... is somehow...<br> ... well, small.<br> [CLEARING THROAT]<br> "Small."<br> I think he's narrow... selfish.<br> He takes himself so seriously.<br> He's the incarnation of taste.<br> [COUGH COUGH]<br> His taste is exquisite.<br> You ever seen such a taste, a really exquisite one, ruffled?<br> I hope I will never fail to gratify my husband's.<br> Oh.<br> That's... that's capital, that's...<br> wonderful!<br> That's what every wife would wish for.<br> But weren't you meant for something better<br> than to guard the sensibilities of a sterile dilettante?<br> I've said what I've had on my mind.<br> Said it because I love you.<br> Then you're not disinterested.<br> I love you, but without hope.<br> I see Mr Osmond in quite another way.<br> He's not important, no. He's not rich.<br> He has no titles nor honours nor property.<br> If that's what you mean by small, he's as small as you please.<br> I call that large.<br> It's the largest thing I know.<br> He... he has the gentlest,<br> kindest, lightest spirit.<br> You've got hold of a false idea.<br> It's a pity, but I can't help it.<br> [COUGHING]<br> [CHILDREN SHOUTING IN PLAY]<br> Osmond: They think I'm in love with your money.<br> Isabel: How do you know what they think?<br> You've not told me they're pleased,<br> and if they had been, I should have had some sign of it.<br> I care for only one thing,<br> for you not having the shadow of a doubt.<br> You know I have not, not one shadow.<br> I have never in my life tried to earn a penny.<br> I ought to be less subject to suspicion...<br> than most people one sees grubbing.<br> I won't pretend I'm sorry you're rich, I'm delighted.<br> At moments I'd like to kneel by my uncle's grave and thank him.<br> It has made me better, loving you.<br> I'm not a failure, as I used to think.<br> I've succeeded in two things.<br> I am to marry the woman I adore,<br> and I've brought up my child in the old way.<br> We'll amuse ourselves making up some little life for her.<br> [BIRDS CRYING]<br> Man: That's why I wanted your advice...<br> as an old friend of Miss Osmond's family.<br> What have you got besides your Spanish lace and Dresden teacups?<br> My collection's well thought of and I've a comfortable little fortune,<br> about 40,000 francs a year.<br> Miss Osmond and I can live beautifully on that.<br> Beautifully? No. Sufficiently, yes.<br> Her father can give you nothing.<br> He, uh, he lives like a rich man.<br> The money's his wife's.<br> She brought him a large fortune.<br> Mrs Osmond is fond of her stepdaughter, she may do something.<br> For a lovesick man, you have your wits about you.<br> No, she will probably prefer to keep her money for her own children.<br> Her own children? Surely she has none.<br> She may have yet.<br> She had a poor little boy who died almost two years ago.<br> I'm... very sorry.<br> Uh, she's a splendid woman.<br> I don't say your offer's to be jumped at,<br> but there might be a worse one.<br> Mr Osmond, however, will believe he can do better.<br> He can do better, perhaps,<br> but his daughter can do no better than marry the man she loves.<br> Well, she does, you know.<br> And, in the meanwhile, I'll say a word to Mrs Osmond.<br> No. No, don't set her going, or you'll spoil everything.<br> Her husband's sure to have other views.<br> I advise you not to multiply the points of difference between them.<br> Let the matter alone until I've taken a few soundings.<br> Let the matter alone?<br> But I'm in love!<br> Oh, you won't burn up.<br> [STRING QUARTET PLAYS]<br> [SERVANTS" OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> Where is Pansy?<br> She has already come down.<br> [STRING QUARTET FINISHES]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> Osmond: I hate his proposal.<br> I let him see that. I was rude to him on purpose.<br> I'll tell him you'll think it over.<br> No! Don't do that, he'll hang on.<br> I hate talking with a donkey...<br> He's a gentleman.<br> He has a charming temper...<br> and, after all, a comfortable income.<br> It's misery, genteel misery.<br> It's not what I dreamed of for Pansy.<br> Fortunately, this doesn't find me unprepared.<br> It's what I educated her for.<br> It's all for this, that when a case like this should come up,<br> she should do what I prefer.<br> I've never been treated so. I don't know what's against me.<br> It's not how I'm considered. I could have married 2O times.<br> You're not rich enough for Pansy.<br> - She doesn't care about money.<br> - No. But her father does.<br> Oh, yes. Well, you would know that.<br> You're offended.<br> And now you'll never help me.<br> It's not that I won't...<br> I simply can't.<br> Osmond: Isabel, I bring you an old friend.<br> Lord Warburton.<br> I've only just arrived this afternoon.<br> I knew you were at home on Thursdays, so... I came.<br> You see, the fame of your Thursdays has spread to England. Excuse me.<br> We're greatly flattered.<br> I'm really very glad to see you.<br> There's something I must tell you without further delay.<br> I've brought Ralph Touchett with me.<br> No, no, he's not here. He's at the hotel.<br> He was too tired to come.<br> Why has he come to Rome?<br> He's very far gone, Mrs Osmond.<br> He can't keep warm. And the further south we come, the colder he feels.<br> If you don't mind my saying,<br> it was the most extraordinary time for Mrs Touchett to go to America.<br> Do you know what your father said to me just now?<br> Don't speak so loud. Everyone will hear.<br> He says you've forgotten me.<br> No... I don't forget.<br> Everything's just the same?<br> Not the very same. Paps been terribly severe.<br> He forbids me to marry you.<br> Need you mind that?<br> I can't disobey Pap.<br> You sacrifice me like that?<br> I love you just as much.<br> What good will that do me?<br> Please don't talk any more. Pap said I was not to talk to you.<br> It's too much.<br> - May I introduce you to some people?<br> - Oh, no, please don't.<br> Unless it be to that young lady at the tea table.<br> She has a charming face.<br> That's my husband's daughter.<br> What a dear little maid.<br> - You must meet her.<br> - Oh, in a... in a moment.<br> I like looking at her from here.<br> You know... you've changed a bit.<br> Yes, a good deal.<br> I don't mean for the worse, of course.<br> And yet how can I say for the better?<br> [HACKING COUGH]<br> [CLEARING THROAT]<br> Oh.<br> [COUGHING]<br> [HACKING COUGH]<br> I think, after all, that I shan't go to Sicily.<br> Won't go to Sicily?<br> Where will you go?<br> I guess I won't go anywhere.<br> Do you mean to return to England?<br> Oh, dear, no.<br> - I'll stay in Rome.<br> - Warburton: Rome won't do for you.<br> - Rome's too cold.<br> - It will have to do. I'll make it do.<br> Warburton: I recommend that you try Sicily.<br> I can't try. I can't move further.<br> I can't face the journey. And I haven't a cousin in Sicily.<br> What does the doctor say?<br> [SIGHS] I haven't asked him, and I don't care a fig.<br> If I die here, you'll bury me.<br> You shan't die here.<br> Ralph: I can't believe she's so cold.<br> She's utterly changed. It's Osmond.<br> [BEGGING ALMS IN ITALIAN]<br> I recommend that you get the doctor's consent all the same.<br> [SIGHS DEEPLY]<br> The doctor's consent would spoil it.<br> You're sacrificing your health to your curiosity, then?<br> I'm not interested in my health, I'm deeply interested in Mrs Osmond.<br> So am I.<br> Not as I once was.<br> [RALPH COUGHS]<br> [CLEARING THROAT]<br> Permit to ask whether it's to bring out that fact...<br> that you're so very civil to the little girl?<br> Does that strike you as ridiculous?<br> Of course, there's the difference in our ages... more than 20 years.<br> My dear Warburton... are you serious?<br> Perfectly serious... as far as I've got.<br> [SIGHS]<br> I'm glad.<br> And heaven help us how cheered up Osmond will be.<br> I say, don't spoil it.

He stayed half an hour.<br> Did he talk to Pansy?<br> He talked almost only to her.<br> It seems to me he's attentive.<br> Isn't that what you call it?<br> I don't call it anything. I'm waiting for you to give it a name.<br> Will you excuse us?<br> [SERVANT SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [DOOR CLOSES]<br> That's a consideration you don't always show.<br> I...

Hmm?<br> And remember how much I count on you.<br> It's all Pansy's.<br> It must be hers.<br> Yes.

Of course I will, if you like.<br> If I like? Oh, you dance with her only because I like it.<br> I'm afraid I bore her.<br> She has a lot of young fellows on her book.<br> Please, let me understand.<br> Understand what?<br> You told me you'd like to marry my stepdaughter,<br> you've not forgotten it?<br> Forgotten it? No. I wrote to Mr Osmond this morning.<br> He didn't mention to me that he'd heard from you.<br> It's an awkward sort of letter to write.<br> Don't forget to send it.<br> Oh, most certainly.<br> Are you not dancing?<br> Certainly not, if I can't dance with her.<br> - You should leave, then.<br> - Not until she does.<br> Lord Warburton: Who's your dismal friend?<br> He has a face a yard long.<br> He has reason.<br> - My husband won't listen to him.<br> - Oh, dear me.<br> He looked a well set-up young fellow.<br> You've a kind thought even for a rival.<br> A rival?<br> You don't mean that she cares for him?<br> Well, yes...<br> I think she does.<br> You told me that she would have no wish but her father's and that he favoured me.<br> I told you she had an immense wish to please her father.<br> That seems very proper.<br> Very proper...<br> but hardly the sort of feeling a man would wish to be indebted for a wife.<br> Why are you so unwilling, so... sceptical?<br> - You're the most wonderful dancer.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> I want you to answer me a question.<br> It's about Lord Warburton.<br> [CLEARS THROAT]<br> Is...<br> Is he really in love?<br> Yes, I think, very much. I can make that out.<br> Oh.<br> You seem disappointed.<br> No...<br> No, only mistaken.<br> I'd made out that he doesn't really care for Pansy.<br> Oh, for Pansy, no.<br> But you just said now that he did.<br> That he cared for you.<br> - That is nonsense, you know.<br> - To me, he's denied it.<br> Ralph...<br> you give me no help.<br> How unhappy you must be.<br> When... When I talk of your helping me, I...<br> I-I talk great nonsense.<br> The idea of troubling you with my domestic embarrassments...<br> Your husband may think you haven't...<br> pushed enough.<br> It's a matter we can hardly quarrel about,<br> for almost all of the interest is on his side.<br> You know what his interest will make him say?<br> It will make him say that your lack of zeal is owing to jealousy.<br> - To jealousy?<br> - To jealousy of his daughter.<br> Oh, you're not kind.<br> Be frank with me, and you'll see.<br> If I try to learn what you want...<br> what you desire...<br> it's only so that I may act accordingly.<br> The only thing I want in life... is to marry Mr Rosier.<br> Your father would like you to make a better marriage.<br> What should you like me to do?<br> Lord Warburton...<br> has shown you great attention.<br> If you mean that he'll propose for me,<br> I think you're mistaken.<br> Your father would like it extremely.<br> Lord Warburton won't propose simply to please Pap<br> Oh, no. There's no danger.<br> There's no danger.<br> It's as if he said to me,<br> "I like you very much, but if it doesn't please you,<br> "I would never say it again."<br> And... he doesn't care for me, either.<br> Oh, no. There's no danger.<br> You must tell your father that.<br> I'd rather not.<br> You wouldn't let him have false hopes?<br> But it will be good for me that he should.<br> Then Pap won't propose anyone else...<br> and that will be a great advantage for me.<br> Rosier.<br> [WHISPERING] ROsier.<br> Does Warburton form his words with such difficulty?<br> Hmm?<br> When he told you he intended to write, what did you say to him?<br> I think I told him not to forget it.<br> Apparently, he has forgotten. Please remind him.<br> If hands are to be laid on Lord Warburton, lay them yourself.<br> It's hard with you working against me.<br> I told you I'd do what I could.<br> Yes, that gained you time.<br> My husband and I were just now talking of you.<br> We wondered what had become of you. We thought perhaps you'd gone away.<br> I'm only on the point of going.<br> I find myself suddenly recalled to England.<br> I'm awfully sorry to leave poor Touchett.<br> Take poor Touchett with you.<br> He'd better wait for warmer weather.<br> I shouldn't advise him to... to travel just now.<br> Hmm.<br> I have a letter to write before dinner. Will you excuse me?<br> Of course, when you come to Rome, you'll always look us up.<br> I'm glad it's the last time.<br> So am I.<br> She doesn't care for me.<br> [CLOCK CHIMES]<br> [CHIME]<br> [CHIME]<br> [CHIME]<br> [CHIME]<br> Good night, Pap<br> Good night. Sleep well.<br> Don't go. I have something to say to you.<br> I don't understand what you wish to do.<br> I wish to go to bed. I'm very tired.<br> I think you're trying to humiliate me.<br> You're playing a very deep game.<br> You've managed it beautifully.<br> What have I managed?<br> You've kept this matter quite in your own hands.<br> Will you tell me in the plainest words of what it is you accuse me?<br> Of having prevented Pansy's marriage to Warburton.<br> Are those words plain enough?<br> On the contrary, I took great interest in it.<br> When you counted on me, I accepted the obligation.<br> I was a fool, but I did it.<br> You pretended to do it.<br> Where is the letter you told me he'd written?<br> I haven't the least idea.<br> No, you destroyed it.<br> Oh, Gilbert, for a man who was so fine...<br> I was never so fine as you.<br> You've done everything that you wanted.<br> You got him out of the way without appearing to,<br> and you've placed me in the position in which you wish to see me.<br> As a man who tried to marry his daughter to a Lord,<br> but grotesquely failed.<br> - Pansy doesn't care for him.<br> - That has nothing to do with it!<br> - And he doesn't...<br> - That won't do! You told me he did!<br> After this, you must attend to such things yourself.<br> I always thought you were fond of my daughter.<br> I have never been more so than now.<br> Your affection has immense limitations.<br> However, that, perhaps, is natural.<br> Is that all you wish to say to me?<br> Are you satisfied? Huh?<br> Am I sufficiently disappointed?<br> I don't think, on the whole, you're disappointed.<br> You've had another opportunity to try to stupefy me.<br> It's not that.<br> It's proved that Pansy can aim high.<br> I suppose you know you can't go back to England alone.<br> I had no idea of doing that. I'll have people with me.<br> What do you mean by people?<br> Servants whom you pay?<br> After all, they're human beings.<br> I guess I'll go with you.<br> - Go with me? [CLEARS THROAT]<br> - Yes.<br> I know you don't like me but I'll go with you.<br> And what's more, I'll take care of you.<br> I like you very much.<br> You needn't think you can buy me off.<br> I'm afraid I shall be a fifth wheel to the coach.<br> Mrs Osmond wants me to travel with you.<br> But that isn't the principal thing.<br> The principal thing is she wants me to leave Rome.<br> She wants us all to leave Rome.<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> It's wonderfully good of you.<br> I can't tell you how kind I think you.<br> With a few words like that, you make me go?<br> - You must come back someday.<br> - I don't care for your cousin.<br> Is that what you wish to tell me?<br> No. No, I don't want to TELL you anything.<br> I can't understand. What am I to believe?<br> What do you want me to think?<br> If you're happy, I'd like to know it. That would be something for me.<br> You SAY you're happy,<br> and yet, somehow, you're so...<br> still, so smooth...<br> so hard.<br> You're completely changed. You conceal everything.<br> - I haven't really come near you.<br> - You come very near.<br> [COUGHS]<br> You seem uncommonly glad to get rid of us all.<br> My dear Ralph.<br> I've seen less of you than I might have,<br> but it's been better than nothing.<br> I've heard a great deal about you.<br> I don't know from whom, living the life you've done.<br> From the voices of the air.<br> You've been my best friend.<br> It was for you that I wanted to live,<br> but I'm of no use to you.<br> If you should send for me...<br> I'd come.<br> Your husband won't consent to that.<br> No, he won't like it,<br> but I might go all the same.<br> I'd hoped to find Lord Warburton here and to be able to congratulate Pansy.<br> You shouldn't have gone to Naples, then. You should've stayed here to watch the affair.<br> Is it too late?<br> It's all over. Please...<br> just let it rest.<br> I've no doubt Osmond will happily discuss it with you.<br> Oh, I know what he thinks. He came to see me last evening.<br> As soon as you arrived?<br> Your husband judges you severely.<br> Wait. Please.<br> I want, if possible, to learn the truth.<br> What truth do you speak of?<br> Just this...<br> whether Lord Warburton changed his mind quite of his own accord...<br> or because you recommended it.<br> To please himself, I mean, or to please you?<br> Now, don't be unreasonable.<br> Don't take offence.<br> If Lord Warburton simply got tired of the child,<br> that's one thing, and it's a pity.<br> But if he gave her up to please you,<br> that's another.<br> If that's the case...<br> let him off, let us have him.<br> Who are you?<br> Ah, you take it like that.<br> What have you to do with me?<br> Everything.<br> I would give my right hand to be able to weep.<br> What good would it do you to weep?<br> It would make me feel...<br> as I felt before I knew you.<br> If I've dried up your tears, that's something,<br> but I've seen you shed them.<br> You'll make me cry still, make me howl like a wolf.<br> I've a great need of that.<br> I was vile this afternoon. I was horrid.<br> You may have said things that were in bad taste.<br> I was full of something bad...<br> or something good, I don't know, I couldn't help it.<br> You've not only dried up my tears, you've dried up my soul.<br> You're very bad.<br> Is this the way we're to end?<br> How do bad people end?<br> Especially as to their common crimes?<br> You have made me as bad as yourself.<br> You seem to me quite good enough.<br> Oh, God!<br> God!<br> [SCREAMS]<br> So you're going to weep after all?<br> Have I ever complained to you?<br> Of course you haven't, you've enjoyed your triumph too much.<br> You made your wife afraid of you, she was...<br> She was afraid of me today, but it was really you she feared.<br> This whole idea didn't originate with me.<br> It was your genius that brought it about.<br> I only ask that my wife should like me.<br> Oh, Jesus, she should like you so much?<br> If you'll make a tragedy of that, the tragedy is hardly for her.<br> It's for me.<br> I live with the consequences, so must you.<br> Please be careful with that precious object.<br> It already has a wee bit of a tiny crack.<br> However, since my wife doesn't like me,<br> I shall look for compensation in Pansy.<br> Fortunately, I haven't a fault to find with her.<br> [CHILDREN BEGGING]<br> Mia!<br> Listen to me.<br> Oh! Leave me.<br> Pansy!<br> - Oh...<br> - Pansy.<br> Pansy? Pansy?<br> - Mrs Osmond? Mrs Osmond!<br> - Pansy.<br> Mrs Osmond!<br> I've been in Paris!<br> I've sold my bibelots!<br> The result's magnificent, $50,000!<br> Will Mr Osmond think me rich enough now?<br> Oh...<br> Pipi... eat your food. Very good. Pipi.<br> Oh.<br> [SISTER SPEAKING ITALIAN] PREEGO, SIGNORA.<br> Is Pansy not well?<br> No. She is quite well,<br> but I've sent her to the convent.<br> I didn't speak of it to you because I doubt if I can make you understand.<br> One's daughter should be fresh and fair.<br> Pansy's a little dusty, a little dishevelled.<br> She'll have time to think,<br> and there's something I want her to think about.<br> It's very absurd, my dear Osmond.<br> Why don't you just say you want to get her out of my way?<br> My dear Amy, if that were the case,<br> it would be much simpler to banish you.<br> You know I think very well of Mr Rosier.<br> I do, indeed.<br> He seems to be simpaticissimo.<br> He's made me believe in, ah, true love.<br> Oh... Excuse me for disturbing you.<br> When I come into your room, I always knock.<br> I forgot.<br> I had something else to think of.<br> My cousin's dying.<br> I don't believe that.<br> He was dying when we married. He'll outlive us all.<br> My aunt telegraphed for me.<br> I must go to England.<br> - I don't see the need of it.<br> - I must see Ralph before he dies.<br> I shall not like it if you do.<br> You won't like it if I don't.<br> You like nothing I do or don't do.<br> You pretend to think I lie.<br> That's why you go, then?<br> Not to see your cousin, but to take revenge on me?<br> You wish immensely I would commit some folly.<br> If you leave Rome today, it will be an act of the most deliberate,<br> the most calculated opposition.<br> I can't tell you how unjust you seem to me.<br> It's your own opposition that's calculated.<br> It's malignant.<br> I have an ideal of what my wife should do and should not do.<br> She should not travel across Europe to sit at the bedside of other men.<br> Your cousin is nothing to you. He's nothing to us.<br> You smile most expressively when I talk about us,<br> but I assure you that we...<br> we, Mrs Osmond...<br> is all I know.<br> You are nearer to me than any other human creature,<br> and I am nearer to you.<br> It may be a disagreeable proximity,<br> but it is one of our own deliberate making.<br> You don't like to be reminded of that, I know...<br> but I am perfectly willing, because...<br> because I believe we should accept the consequences of our actions...<br> and what I value most in life is the honour of the thing.<br> Oh! My dear.<br> Do tell me some amusing book to read.<br> Would this do me any good?<br> My cousin, Ralph Touchett, is dying.<br> Oh... He was so simpatico.<br> I'm awfully sorry for you.<br> You look very badly.<br> Osmond says it's impossible I should go to England.<br> And why does Osmond say it's impossible?<br> Because we're so happy together...<br> that we can't separate, even for a fortnight.<br> You're very unhappy.<br> Yes.<br> But I don't think you can comfort me.<br> Will you give me leave to try?<br> There is something I want you to know.<br> Perhaps you do. Perhaps you've guessed it.<br> Oh, in your place I should have guessed it ages ago.<br> Have you never really suspected?<br> Suspected what?<br> My first sister-in-law had no children.<br> The poor woman was married hardly three years and died childless.<br> Pansy's not my husband's child, then?<br> Oh, your husband's in perfection, but not his wife's.<br> Oh, my dear Isabel, with you, one must dot one's i's.<br> Whose child?<br> Oh, she's been wonderfully clever, magnificent about Pansy.<br> Had it never occurred to you...<br> that Serena Merle was for six or seven years his lover?<br> [SOBBING]<br> At last you understand.<br> [SERENA AND NUNS SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> Nun: Si.<br> You're surprised to find me here.<br> And I'm afraid you're not pleased.<br> I confess I've been indiscreet, I ought to have asked permission.<br> I came to see Pansy.<br> It occurred to me this afternoon that she must be rather lonely.<br> That it's a little dismal.<br> So I came, on...<br> the chance...<br> [NUN SPEAKING ITALIAN]<br> Don't you think I've made it pretty?<br> Yes. It seems... it seems comfortable.<br> I've come to bid you goodbye.<br> I'm going to England.<br> Not to come back?<br> My cousin is very ill.<br> Don't leave me here.<br> Will you come with me now?<br> Did Paptell you to ask me that?<br> No. It's my own proposal.<br> I had better wait, then.<br> [CLEARS THROAT]<br> He thinks I have not had enough, but I have.<br> He wished me to think a little, and I have thought a great deal.<br> What have you thought?<br> That I must never displease Pap.<br> Grazie.<br> I found I wished to wait for you.<br> But it's not to talk about Pansy.<br> Are you very fond of your cousin?<br> - I don't understand you.<br> - It's hard to explain.<br> Your cousin once did you a great service. Have you...<br> never guessed it?<br> He made you rich.<br> He made me?<br> It was your uncle's money, but it was your cousin's idea.<br> He brought his father over to it.<br> I don't know why you say such things.<br> - I don't know how you know.<br> - I know nothing, but what I've guessed,<br> and I've guessed that.<br> At bottom, it's him you've to thank.<br> I believed it was you I had to thank.<br> [TRYING TO CLOSE CARRIAGE DOOR]<br> You're very unhappy, I know.<br> But I'm more so.<br> [THUNDER]<br> [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]<br> Hello. Isn't it wonderful she's come?<br> - How was the channel?<br> - Very fine.<br> No.<br> No, I believe it was very rough.<br> [DOGS BARKING]<br> Isabel: Will he see me?<br> Can he speak to me?<br> You can try him.<br> - Is there really no hope?<br> - None whatsoever.<br> There never has been.<br> [MUTTERING]<br> It's very good of you to come.<br> I thought you would, but I wasn't sure.<br> I wasn't sure, either...<br> till I came.<br> With me it's all over.<br> Isabel...<br> [CRYING]<br> I wish it were over for you.<br> What is it you have done for me in leaving Rome?<br> What is it you did for me?<br> You did something once.<br> You know it.<br> Oh...<br> Ralph.<br> Keep me in your heart.<br> I shall be nearer to you than I've ever been.<br> I never thanked you.<br> I... I never spoke.<br> I never was what I should be.<br> Yet how could I know? I only know today...<br> because there are people less stupid than I.<br> Don't mind people.<br> Is it true?<br> That you've been stupid?<br> No.<br> He married me for the money.<br> I only want you to understand.<br> I always tried to keep you from understanding.<br> But that's all over.<br> Was he very bad about your coming?<br> He made it very hard for me...<br> but I don't care.<br> Here... with you...<br> I'm happier than I've been in a long time.<br> I want you to be happy.<br> To feel that I'm near you.<br> That I love you.<br> Why should there be pain?<br> That's not the deepest thing.<br> [SOBBING]<br> You must stay here.<br> Pain's deep...<br> but it... passes, after all.<br> - It's passing now.<br> - Oh...<br> But love remains.<br> I don't know why we should suffer so much,<br> perhaps I should find out.<br> [SOBBING]<br> Shh...<br> I don't believe...<br> I don't believe such a generous mistake as yours...<br> can hurt you for more than a little.<br> [LAUGHS]<br> And remember this...<br> that if you have been hated,<br> you've also been loved.<br> Oh, but, Isabel...<br> ...adored.<br> Minister: Man that is born of woman<br> has but a short time to live and is full of misery.<br> He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.<br> He fleeth as it were a shadow and never continueth upon this day.<br> In the midst of life we are in death.<br> Of whom may we seek for succour but of thee, o Lord,<br> who for our sins art justly mispleased?<br> [BIRDS SINGING]<br> I adore him.<br> I adore him.<br> I adore him.<br> Oh. [GASPS]<br> You frightened me.<br> I wanted to see you alone.<br> So I've been waiting and, uh, walking about.<br> I don't wish to trouble you as I did in Rome.<br> That was no use. It only distressed you.<br> I knew I was wrong.<br> But I'm not wrong now.<br> It's very different now. I can help you.<br> How can you help me?<br> It was good when you made me come away with your cousin.<br> He was a good man. A fine man.<br> He told me how the case stands for you.<br> He explained everything.<br> He guessed my sentiments.<br> Do you know what he told me here the last time I saw him?<br> He said, "Do everything you can for her.<br> "Everything she'll let you."<br> You had no business to talk of me.<br> Why not?<br> Why not, when we talked in that way? He was dying.<br> It's too late to play a part.<br> Touchett knew and I knew what it cost you to come here.<br> It will cost you your life.<br> Give me one word of truth.<br> You're afraid to go back.<br> You're perfectly alone.<br> Now I want you to think of me.<br> - To think of you.<br> - Turn to me.<br> Why should you go back?<br> Why go through that ghastly form?<br> - To get away from you.<br> - I want to prevent that!<br> [BREATHING HARD]<br> If you'd only for once listen to me.<br> Why shouldn't we be happy?<br> Why? Why, when it's here before us? When it's so easy?<br> We can do absolutely as we please.<br> To whom under the sun do we owe anything?<br> I beg you to go away.<br> Don't say that, don't kill me.<br>
