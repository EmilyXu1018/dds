Anything more<br> you can do with the stabilizers?<br> Nothing's wrong with the stabilizers<br> so there's nothing more I can do.<br> Besides, my hands are full<br> with this pump!<br> You know what the trouble is.<br> It's that bastard Linarcos.<br> Care to repeat yourself?<br> He's standing right here.<br> Good, I hope he heard me!<br> All right, Joe, do the best you can<br> until we clear this weather.<br> - Where the devil did you come from?<br> - From my cabin, sir.<br> Don't you realize it's<br> dangerous out there?<br> You said come up anytime.<br> Robin Shelby...<br> ...remember?<br> You picked a particularly<br> fascinating moment to come here.<br> The waves don't bother you?<br> I've surfed up to 18 feet.<br> - But these look more like 30.<br> - Thirty-five to be exact.<br> Some get up to 300.<br> - I find 60 about maximum. Steady up.<br> - Steady up, sir.<br> - Bring her up.<br> - Bring her up, sir.<br> Hang on!<br> - All lifelines rigged?<br> - All except C deck, sir.<br> When I order all lifelines rigged<br> it includes C deck. See to it.<br> Wow, surf's really up.<br> - Master Shelby.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> We'll continue our discussion<br> another time. Fair enough?<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> That last one almost<br> broached us, Linarcos.<br> I warned you. We should've<br> loaded extra bunkers in Gibraltar.<br> We are top-heavy and when<br> that pump is repaired...<br> ...I am taking on more ballast.<br> - Where next?<br> - Mr. and Mrs. Rogo, M45.<br> - Yeah?<br> - I'm Dr. Caravello. You asked for me.<br> All morning.<br> - You the only doctor on this tub?<br> - The only ship doctor.<br> What if somebody was dying?<br> Oh, my God, who's not dying?<br> Most of the passengers<br> are sick, Mr. Rogo.<br> We have to take them in rotation.<br> Use one of these now,<br> another in 8 hours...<br> ...and remain in bed<br> until the sea is calm.<br> Hold it, hold it.<br> You mean we had to wait all<br> this time for you to come...<br> ...and give her some pills?<br> And some crap about staying in bed?<br> How do you know she's just seasick?<br> Look at her!<br> It could be something else.<br> You didn't even examine her.<br> Oh, shoot me, Mike.<br> For chrissake, just shoot me.<br> You see how sick she is?<br> I'll tell you what this is.<br> It's food poisoning, that's what.<br> How is she gonna swallow pills<br> when she can't even swallow water?<br> They're suppositories, Mr. Rogo.<br> You...<br> ...don't swallow them.<br> What do you do with them?<br> I know what to do with suppositories.<br> Just get them out of here!<br> Oh, hon...<br> Nurse, I think we should<br> continue with our rounds.<br> I still think it's food poisoning.<br> Oh, shut up.<br> - Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Rosen.<br> - Good morning.<br> Don't fall over.<br> - That Martin, he's crazy.<br> - I like that man.<br> Of course you like him.<br> He runs on time like a train.<br> You and trains.<br> When, in my whole life,<br> did I ever run for a train?<br> Who cried for a week when<br> they tore down the 3rd Avenue EI?<br> Yeah.<br> He's lonely.<br> That's why he runs,<br> so you won't notice.<br> Says here there's a package<br> tour to the mountain...<br> ...where Moses received<br> the Ten Commandments.<br> No.<br> When we finally get to Israel,<br> we're gonna stay put, no traveling.<br> We're gonna get to know our grandson.<br> Just think, he's 2 years old already.<br> He's talking.<br> We've never even seen him.<br> Get down on your knees<br> and pray to God for help...<br> ...and then maybe everything<br> will work out?<br> Garbage.<br> Not where I come from.<br> You could wear off your knees praying<br> to God for heat in February.<br> And icicles would grow<br> from your upraised palms.<br> If you're freezing to death,<br> you burn the furniture...<br> ...but you get off your knees.<br> - Somewhat unorthodox, Reverend Scott.<br> But realistic.<br> John, use your church for something<br> more than prayer.<br> With those sermons, it's a wonder<br> you're still ordained.<br> - Or are you?<br> - The best kind.<br> Angry, rebellious,<br> critical, a renegade...<br> ...stripped of most of my<br> so-called clerical powers.<br> But I'm still in business.<br> - You seem to enjoy the punishment.<br> - Punishment?<br> The Church has blessed me,<br> that's what it's done.<br> Banished to a new country in Africa.<br> Hell, I had to look it up on a map.<br> My bishop doesn't know, but he's<br> given me exactly what I wanted:<br> Elbow room. Freedom!<br> Real freedom. Freedom to dump<br> all the rules and all the trappings.<br> And freedom to discover God<br> in my own way.<br> I'd better be going.<br> I'll see you later.<br> John.<br> Still want me to give<br> that sermon this afternoon?<br> Well, one thing's for sure:<br> Nobody will sleep through it.<br> The weather report, sir.<br> "Weather moderate to the southeast.<br> Barometer 1016 millibars.<br> Smooth seas, clear skies." Good.<br> Keep her on slow,<br> start taking on ballast.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Full ahead, captain.<br> As I've told you, we don't have<br> enough ballast yet to run full ahead.<br> I suggest we talk privately.<br> Linus, start taking on ballast.<br> I did not suggest full ahead, captain.<br> As the new owner's representative...<br> ...I ordered it.<br> - Damn it, man...<br> ...the Poseidon is too fine a lady<br> to be rushed to the junkyard.<br> We're three days behind schedule and<br> it's costing thousands of dollars...<br> ...to maintain a wrecking crew.<br> We dock Monday!<br> I can't gamble with<br> my passengers' lives!<br> Your business is to deliver this ship<br> when and where we want it.<br> An unstable ship at full ahead is<br> dangerous. Especially one this old.<br> I'm sure I don't have to remind you<br> of my right to relieve your command.<br> Three other officers<br> have their master's license.<br> Now, order full ahead.<br> You irresponsible bastard.<br> Full ahead!<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Where did that lot come from?<br> They boarded at Gibraltar.<br> They're on their way to Sicily.<br> A free trip for free music.<br> They're going to a jazz festival.<br> Morning after<br> I can't take this.<br> Give me a Strauss waltz.<br> I rather fancy it.<br> You? You even fancy bagpipes.<br> Hey, did you know this?<br> The engines on this ship<br> have more total horsepower...<br> ...than all the cavalry Napoleon<br> used to conquer Europe.<br> How about that?<br> That's heavy, Robin, real heavy.<br> The generator creates enough<br> electricity...<br> ...to light Charleston, South Carolina,<br> and Atlanta, Georgia.<br> - Shelby?<br> - That's right.<br> - Cable.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's my turn to open the cable.<br> - Don't be so childish.<br> "Mother and I waiting impatiently<br> your arrival.<br> Our thoughts and our love with you<br> on this New Year's Eve. Dad."<br> - We should've sent them a wire.<br> - I did.<br> How come you didn't ask me for<br> my ideas? I mean, what to put in it.<br> Why couldn't I have had a brother<br> that's easier to live with?<br> - Stop jumping and go take a shower.<br> - I'm going to the engine room.<br> - You're going to church services.<br> - On vacation?<br> - Will you get in that bathroom?<br> - I want to see the propeller shaft.<br> - You'll see the propeller shaft later.<br> - Why don't you shove it?<br> Don't you ever say that to me again.<br> Shove it, shove it, shove it.<br> God is pretty busy.<br> He has a plan for humanity that<br> stretches beyond our comprehension.<br> So we can't expect Him to concern<br> Himself with the individual.<br> The individual is important<br> only to the extent...<br> ...of providing a creative link<br> between the past and the future...<br> ...in his children,<br> or in his grandchildren...<br> ...or his contributions to humanity.<br> Therefore, don't pray to God<br> to solve your problems.<br> Pray to that part of God within you.<br> Have the guts to fight for yourself.<br> God wants brave souls.<br> He wants winners, not quitters.<br> If you can't win, at least try to win.<br> God loves tryers.<br> - Isn't that right, Robin?<br> - Right.<br> So, what resolution should<br> we make for the New Year?<br> Resolve to let God know that<br> you have the guts to do it alone!<br> Resolve to fight for yourselves<br> and for others...<br> ...and for those you love.<br> That part of God within you will<br> be fighting with you...<br> ...all the way.<br> Do you know what it means to be picked<br> out from all the people on this boat...<br> ...to sit at the captain's table<br> on New Year's Eve?<br> I'll tell you one thing it means.<br> That your worries about other women<br> looking down on you is bull.<br> He only invited us because<br> you're a detective lieutenant.<br> Why don't you just go without me?<br> What am I supposed do at midnight,<br> kiss the captain?<br> Don't knock it.<br> Why don't you admit the real reason?<br> You're still afraid some bum<br> will recognize you.<br> That's pretty stupid!<br> You're out of that business now.<br> You're my wife.<br> You can't go around afraid<br> all the time...<br> ...that every guy you bump into<br> is a former customer!<br> Linda, you hear me?<br> Will you shut up? I'm busy in here!<br> You weren't on the streets that long!<br> How many guys did you know?<br> You realize how slim<br> the chances are...<br> ...that even one of these characters<br> is on this boat?<br> You don't have to shout.<br> I said...<br> I said, do you realize how slim...<br> I heard what you said!<br> Mike.<br> I saw a young officer on deck<br> the other day.<br> And he looked pretty damn familiar.<br> Even with his clothes on.<br> So he recognized you.<br> So?<br> Doesn't that bother you?<br> If it bothered me, I wouldn't<br> have married you.<br> Well, first you arrested me six times!<br> I had to keep you off the streets<br> until you'd marry me!<br> Come here, you lousy cop.<br> Belle.<br> Mr. Martin, what is the<br> little green one for?<br> That's alfalfa, Mrs. Rosen.<br> It's essential to blood formation,<br> neural function and growth.<br> The growth part doesn't work.<br> At least not with me anyway.<br> And the yellow one?<br> That's very attractive.<br> A tocopherol, derived<br> from seed germ oil.<br> - It looks like vitamin E to me.<br> - It is, Mr. Rosen.<br> Doesn't that increase virility?<br> That's the rumor.<br> All you need is a pretty wife.<br> I think I've been a bachelor too long.<br> Sure, you're too busy<br> taking all those pills.<br> There she goes.<br> My wife can't stand seeing<br> anyone who's not married.<br> No.<br> - It comes from caring.<br> - I'd like to be married, Mrs. Rosen.<br> I just can't seem to find the time.<br> I mean, I get down to the shop<br> at 8, I open at 9.<br> I close at 7 and go home at 8.<br> Except on Wednesdays and Fridays,<br> I go home at 10.<br> Mrs. Rosen, when you<br> see your grandson...<br> ...tell him not to become<br> a haberdasher.<br> I know what you mean.<br> We never went to Coney Island until<br> we sold our business last year.<br> You see?<br> Mr. Tinkham, are you married?<br> No marriage for me, Mrs. Rosen.<br> I've got a mistress.<br> - What?<br> - The sea.<br> Hey, that's good!<br> From the seismographic station<br> in Athens, sir.<br> "Sub-sea earthquake,<br> Epicenter 130 miles<br> northwest of Crete."<br> That's the cat this ship<br> is named after?<br> That's right, the great god, Poseidon.<br> In Greek mythology, the god<br> of the seas, storms, tempests...<br> ...earthquakes and other<br> miscellaneous natural disasters.<br> Quite an ill-tempered fellow.<br> - Yes?<br> - Sorry to disturb you, captain.<br> - Please come to the bridge.<br> - Right.<br> Would you all excuse me, please?<br> Duty calls.<br> Reverend, do you mind<br> taking over as host?<br> - Glad to.<br> - Thank you.<br> Thank you, Acres.<br> - Oh, by the way, happy New Year!<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Where you two heading?<br> Oh, Napoli, Roma, Venezia...<br> And don't forget Torino.<br> It's the first vacation<br> we've had since we got married.<br> And why we didn't fly,<br> I'll never know.<br> Well, since I'm in charge,<br> I'm gonna propose a toast.<br> Great.

Grab hold.<br> Excuse me, Reverend,<br> my name's James Martin.<br> - Isn't it better to go up?<br> - What do you mean?<br> It seems that any rescue would<br> have to come through the hull.<br> - The hull? You mean the bottom?<br> - My God, that's right.<br> We're upside down.<br> We've got to go up.<br> Acres, where's that lead to?<br> To the galley, sir.<br> - You stay there, we're coming up.<br> - Wait.<br> How do you figure going through<br> the bottom?<br> It's solid steel.<br> Aft, sir, at the outlet of the<br> propeller shaft.<br> Kid, this isn't some toy boat,<br> so you let us figure it out, huh?<br> I'm sorry, sir, but Charley,<br> the third engineer...<br> ...he told me that by the shaft,<br> the hull was only one-inch thick.<br> Look, do you know how thick<br> one inch of steel is?<br> It's one inch less than two inches.<br> We're climbing up! All of us!<br> Is there a ladder there,<br> or something we can climb with?<br> No, sir, this is<br> the linen service area.<br> - Tablecloths?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - We can knot them together.<br> - Wouldn't be strong enough.<br> What we need is a...<br> Something like that,<br> the Christmas tree.<br> - Come on, give me a hand.<br> - No.<br> - You gonna give us a hand?<br> - No. Didn't you hear the purser?<br> He said to stay put and keep calm.<br> Help will be here.<br> - I'm staying right here.<br> - There he goes. That's my old man.<br> - Linda.<br> - Everything by the book!<br> - You stay the hell out of this!<br> - You get your ass with us, mister.<br> Hey...<br> ...watch your language, preacher.<br> You sound like you come from the slum!<br> You son of a bitch, go help him!<br> Okay, okay.<br> Who the hell does he think he is?<br> Clear the way!<br> Come on, clear the way!<br> We're gonna lift on three.<br> Get over.<br> One! Two...<br> For God's sake, Reverend,<br> that's suicide!<br> We're cut off from the world.<br> Maybe we can get to them.<br> - Now, get out of the way.<br> - Pray for us but don't do this!<br> Climbing up will kill you all!<br> Sitting on our butts<br> isn't gonna help us either!<br> Maybe by climbing up<br> we can save ourselves.<br> You got any sense, you'll come too.<br> Grab hold. On three! One!<br> Two! Up!<br> Holy mackerel, it's heavy.<br> All right, forward!<br> Hold it!<br> Let's upend it.<br> Bring it up to your waist.<br> Stand by, Acres!<br> Good for you, Mr. Rosen.<br> All right, come on, everybody!

Easy.<br> - That's it.<br> That's it. Acres, watch out.<br> - Stand clear.<br> - We did it.<br> Acres, can you anchor it up there?<br> - Yeah, I think so, sir.<br> - Good man.<br> - Mr. Rosen.<br> - Yeah?<br> Get your wife.<br> - Are you all fixed up there, Acres?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Let's start climbing up.<br> I need a monkey.<br> - Are you game?<br> - Yes, sir!<br> Good boy.<br> Climb up inside as far as you can go.<br> Then come out and Mr. Acres<br> will give you a hand, okay?<br> No sweat.<br> It's a cinch! Come on!<br> - Now the rest of us.<br> - So you get us up there, then what?<br> Through the kitchen and deeper<br> until we reach the hull.<br> That way.<br> Then you kick out the bottom<br> and swim ashore, huh?<br> Or yell, "This is the police,"<br> and it'll open up.<br> - Don't be a smart-ass.<br> - Susan, you're first.<br> You can't climb in a gown,<br> so it'll have to come off. Okay?<br> Go the same way Robin did...<br> ...and don't look down.<br> - Okay.<br> Excuse me, Reverend, what about<br> all those other people?<br> I'll keep them moving.<br> Try and get the others to join.<br> Okay, Miss Rogo, up you go.<br> - You have to take off the gown.<br> - Like hell she will!<br> - She can't climb in that, too tight.<br> - She's got nothing under it!<br> Just panties. What else do I need?<br> What do you mean, what else?<br> - Give her your shirt.<br> - My...<br> Come on.<br> Linda...<br> ...next time you put something on<br> like I told you to put on.<br> - How you coming, Susan?<br> - All right!<br> Good girl.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> there's very little time.<br> Please, everybody, you heard<br> what the reverend said...<br> ...he's taking us up<br> to the engine room.<br> - Please, everyone, come this way.<br> - Mr. Martin!<br> - We're staying right here.<br> - Can't you see the logic?<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I want you...<br> ...to give this to our<br> little grandson, huh?<br> Why? I'm going somewhere you're not?<br> - Tell me something, Manny.<br> - What is it now?<br> How long you think since we<br> told each other "I love you"?<br> Who knows?<br> Twenty years?<br> Yesterday?<br> I love you.<br> Not many people have had that.<br> Put it back on. You'll give<br> it to him yourself.<br> - No.<br> - Mrs. Rosen...<br> ...we have to go right now.<br> Mr. Scott, a fat woman like me<br> can't climb.<br> - I'll wait here with the others.<br> - I'm afraid I can't allow that.<br> Listen to him, Belle.<br> There's something different up there<br> than there is down here?<br> Yes.<br> Life.<br> Life is up there.<br> And life always matters very much...<br> ...doesn't it?<br> Yes.<br> All right, so I'll climb.<br> Please, Ted.<br> You've got to wake up.<br> We've got something we've got to do.<br> You know how disorganized I am<br> without you.<br> - Wake up.<br> - Miss?<br> Miss?<br> I think you should come with me.<br> Leave him?<br> Oh, I can't.<br> I can't leave my brother.<br> He's all I've got.<br> What's your name?<br> Nonnie.<br> Nonnie...<br> ...your brother's dead.<br> Did you like his music?<br> I would have danced to it...<br> ...if I'd had somebody to dance with.<br> Come, please.<br> Come with me. Please.<br> - Come on, Belle.<br> - I can't!<br> You can. It's just a little higher.<br> I can't, Manny, I'm stuck.<br> I'm stuck in the spokes!<br> - Yes, you can.<br> - I can't, Manny!<br> I can't!<br> What's happening? What is that?<br> What's down there?<br> Good girl.<br> - Excuse me for getting so familiar.<br> - What else could you do?<br> Mrs. Peter Pan, I'm not.<br> All right, Belle, let's get up.<br> Come on, come on.<br> That's it. There we go.<br> You ready?<br> - Follow her.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Don't you ever say "please"?<br> - If it'll get you up that tree...<br> ...please.<br> This is Nonnie, she's coming with us.<br> - What about the others?<br> - Nobody will listen.<br> They have more confidence<br> in the purser than in us.<br> You help her up, Mr. Martin,<br> and then you follow her.<br> You didn't say what you thought<br> of my sermon.<br> - You didn't ask me.<br> - I'm asking you now.<br> You spoke only for the strong.<br> I'm asking you to be strong.<br> Come with us.<br> I can't leave these people.<br> I know I can't save them.<br> I suspect we'll die...<br> ...but I can't leave them.<br> They don't want to go.<br> They've chosen to stay.<br> Why should you?<br> What good's your life then?<br> What's it all been for?<br> I have no other choice.<br> John, I'm not gonna give up.<br> Can I have your attention?<br> May I have your attention, please?<br> That's the way out.<br> - That's our only chance.<br> - Don't listen to him!<br> - We must stay until help arrives.<br> - Help from where?<br> From the captain? He's dead.<br> Everyone above us before the ship<br> turned over is dead.<br> Because now they're under the water.<br> - That's not true!<br> - It is true, you pompous ass!<br> There's nobody alive but us!<br> And nobody's going to help us<br> except ourselves.<br> It's up to each one of you.<br> It's up to all of us. Together.<br> Now, for God's sake, come with me.<br> I order you not to go!<br> He knows nothing about this ship.<br> - He's right.<br> - Mind your own business!<br> - God bless.<br> - God bless you.<br> Here, sir. Here, sir.<br> There you are.<br> - I appeal to you for the last time.<br> - You don't know what you're saying!<br> I know this much:<br> The sea will keep pouring in.<br> We'll keep settling deeper.<br> We may even go under...<br> ...before we cut our way out.<br> But it's a chance.<br> We might make it.<br> If you stay here, you'll die!<br> We are staying with the purser!<br> - Couldn't talk anybody else into it?<br> - We're on our own. Let's get inside.<br> Get them inside! Get in!<br> Let's get to the tree!<br> Hold it!<br> One at a time!<br> - Don't panic!<br> - Goddamn it, get off my back!<br> Don't panic! One at a time!<br> Get off my hand!<br> One at a time! Take it easy!<br> Give me your hand, Reverend!<br> Give me your hand!<br> I'm going under! Help me, help me!<br> I'm going under!<br> I'm going under!<br> I'm going under!<br> Help me, help me! Please!<br> Oh, my God! I don't want to die!<br> Please help me! Please!<br> Don't hang on me! Help me!<br> Which way to the kitchen, Acres?<br> This way, sir.<br> What is that?<br> Fire, sir.<br> - That's a special fire door, eh?<br> - Yes, sir. It's a safety door.<br> - It closes at high temperature, right?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> So any fire would be out of oxygen...<br> Smothered, wouldn't it?<br> - That's the theory, sir.<br> - Let's test it.<br> - Get them to stand away from the door.<br> - Hold it!<br> Do you know what a flash fire is?<br> I won't let you kill us!<br> I'm going through that door, Mr. Rogo.<br> You can either close that door<br> behind me or try to stop me.<br> Now, what's it gonna be?<br> I always thought I was gonna catch it<br> in some tenement by some criminal.<br> Okay, open it.<br> Move back against<br> the bulkhead, please.<br> Would you move back?<br> Thank you. Over there.<br> Here.<br> Get back! Go on!<br> Get back, all of you!<br> Excuse me, Mr. Rogo.<br> What if he doesn't come back?<br> So how the hell do I know?<br> Well, we have to do something.<br> We have to formulate some plan.<br> Meanwhile, what do I tell the others?<br> Tell them to start singing<br> "Nearer, My God, to Thee."<br> Get back! Get back!<br> Okay.<br> - Okay, what?<br> - Acres.<br> Where does the companionway<br> by the kitchen lead to?<br> Down to... Up to broadway, sir.<br> - What's broadway?<br> - Service way that runs along the ship.<br> Does it lead to the engine room?<br> I don't know much about below deck<br> but there might be access from there.<br> There is!<br> - You again?<br> - Sorry, sir.<br> Robin, how do you know<br> about broadway?<br> I went there with my engineer friend.<br> He called it broadway<br> when he took me to the boilers.<br> That's it then.<br> - You're taking his word for it?<br> - Why not?<br> - He's just a kid!<br> - Mrs. Rosen, no more Christmas trees.<br> I'd be grateful.<br> - Can you make it, Acres?<br> - Oh, yes, sir.<br> I'm fine, sir. Fine.<br> - Get your brother.<br> - Nonnie, come on.<br> - Belle, we have to go.<br> - Let's go.<br> There's a lot of dead bodies in there.<br> Not a pretty sight.<br> Don't touch anything, it's hot.<br> No! Manny, the fire will burn us.<br> We'll go back!<br> For 30 years you've been telling me<br> what to do.<br> Now I'm telling you.<br> We're going through!<br> I'll take care of you!<br> Acres, this the only way?<br> Yes, sir.<br> We'll need something<br> to pull you up with.<br> Reverend, try this.<br> Acres, you first. I need you.<br> Rogo, give him a hand.<br> Rogo, Rogo, Rogo.<br> Mr. Rogo, put this around his waist.<br> I think what I don't like<br> about you, Scott, is your attitude.<br> Or is it deeper?<br> Maybe we're two of a kind and<br> you don't like looking at yourself.<br> Through those doors?<br> Oh, no, that's the crew's galley.<br> It's...<br> It's that way, sir.<br> - Get the rest of them.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> All right, grab ahold of this.<br> - I'm surprised the lights still work.<br> - Emergency circuit and batteries.<br> Supposed to stay operational<br> for three hours.<br> They better.<br> Oh, God.<br> - Well?<br> - There's no other exit from this area.<br> There's gotta be. Think.<br> You're all right, Belle.<br> Go ahead, pull.<br> It's okay, Mrs. Rosen.<br> I helped my dad pull in a 600-pound<br> swordfish off Hawaii.<br> There.<br> That's it, sir...<br> ...down there. Right there.<br> I think that's it, sir.<br> - This leads to the central shaft?<br> - It's what I've been told.<br> - Where does it lead to?<br> - I think there's exits on all decks...<br> ...like this one.<br> - It doesn't look very promising.<br> - No, it doesn't.<br> Okay, up you go.<br> The water's coming in!<br> The water's coming in!<br> - There, grab it!<br> - The water's coming in!<br> Shut up!<br> Come on, get up this goddamn ramp!<br> We all can't be as composed<br> as you are, Mrs. Rogo.<br> Come on up here.<br> - Hurry! Hurry!<br> - Get the hose down here.<br> All right, grab it!<br> - Bring it down.<br> - Come on!<br> - Pull! Pull!<br> - Get up.<br> Don't panic, don't panic!<br> All right, all right.<br> - Rogo.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Bring them this way.<br> - Everybody down this way.<br> This is a bunch of crap. We're sinking!<br> Nothing will keep us from drowning!<br> - Keep moving!<br> - He's right.<br> - There are air pockets everywhere.<br> - Air pockets?<br> Yes.<br> Just because that deck flooded<br> doesn't mean this one will.<br> - How long will we stay afloat?<br> - Long enough.<br> Andrea Doria stayed afloat<br> You see, we've got a long time to go.<br> Come on, keep moving.<br> This duct leads to<br> a vertical air shaft.<br> Through that little hole?<br> This little hole will get us<br> up to broadway.<br> We've climbed four decks,<br> two more to go.<br> - This is the only way out.<br> - You expect a person to fit in there?<br> Mrs. Rosen, you'll crawl<br> through there, believe me.<br> She has this illusion.<br> Always thinking she's too fat.<br> - Rogo, follow me.<br> - I figured. It's me again, huh?<br> Why?<br> I'll need you when we get<br> to the other end of this duct.<br> - Mr. Martin!<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Follow at the rear and see that<br> everyone is accounted for.<br> Oh, okay, Reverend.<br> I'm going next...<br> ...so if old fat-ass<br> gets stuck in there...<br> ...I won't be caught behind her.<br> Come on, kids, you're next.<br> Manny...<br> ...if I get stuck, push.<br> Don't worry, you won't get stuck.<br> Watch your head.<br> That's it.<br> - Okay, Nonnie, you're next.<br> - No, with you.<br> With you.<br> - Mr. Acres, would you, please?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Come along. We don't want<br> to lose the others.<br> You'll be right behind me?<br> Like two peas in a pod.<br> Quickly!<br> Hello!<br> Hey!<br> Hey!<br> Hey, in there!<br> You follow me. And don't look down.<br> Easy does it. Come on.<br> Get your foot up on the ladder.<br> That's it.<br> Go ahead, you're all right.<br> Go ahead, honey.<br> I said, don't look down!<br> Okay, okay.<br> Attagirl. Take it easy.<br> This must be it! Bring them up!<br> Don't lose your footing.<br> Your turn, kid.<br> Give Mrs. Rosen a hand.<br> All right, come on.<br> - How you doing, Mrs. Rosen?<br> - Fine.<br> I think I'm getting my second wind.<br> How are you doing, Mr. Rogo?<br> Fine, fine.<br> Don't mind that. Don't mind that.<br> - Just look up.<br> - Manny, are you there?<br> - Where else could I be?<br> - Mrs. Rosen...<br> I didn't mean it<br> to sound the way it did.<br> I miss something?<br> When I told you<br> about Dad's 600-pound swordfish...<br> ...I didn't mean that<br> you weighed that much.<br> With all that's happening,<br> that's what you're worried about?<br> Sure. What else?<br> You're a good boy.<br> Tell my sister.<br> Watch your leg now.<br> It's all right, Mrs. Rosen, come on.<br> I'm coming.<br> Press against my back. Push.<br> - You go first.<br> - All right, Mrs. Rosen.<br> But don't... Don't go too fast.<br> Manny, are you behind me?<br> You haven't lost me yet.<br> Up you go.<br> Up, up.<br> Keep it moving!<br> Nonnie, you all right?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I can't move.<br> I can't.<br> Nonnie, keep your eyes on the ladder.<br> Don't look at anything<br> except the ladder.<br> I'm right here. I'm with you.<br> Do you understand?<br> All right, now, one rung at a time.<br> Just reach up your hand.<br> Now, don't think of anything<br> but the ladder. Go ahead, Nonnie.<br> Come on, what are you doing up there,<br> taking a coffee break? Move it!<br> Please, Mr. Rogo.<br> All right, Nonnie, now your foot.<br> Step up.<br> Step up.<br> That's it.<br> That's it.<br> That's the one.<br> The first rung's the tough one.<br> Now again. Now again.<br> Once more. That's it.<br> All right. One rung at a time now.<br> Now your foot. Now your foot.<br> Keep going. That's it.<br> Okay. Now the next rung.<br> Those terrible explosions.<br> - What's happening?<br> - It's all right. It's all right.<br> We're still afloat.<br> Look!<br> My God! There are<br> other people still alive!<br> You stay here. Help the others out.<br> I'll see where they're going.<br> - Where you going?<br> - We're following the doctor.<br> Doctor!<br> You're going the wrong way.<br> You're going toward the bow.<br> That's right, Reverend.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You can't get out that end.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because we're settling by the bow.<br> The bow's underwater.<br> Go to the stern.<br> We'll exit through the engine room.<br> - It's gone.<br> - How do you know?<br> The explosions. You must've felt them.<br> The only way out is forward!<br> Did you check the engine room?<br> Did you see it?<br> I don't have to. We're going forward.<br> Please, come with us, Reverend.<br> You're going the wrong way, damn it!<br> We lost Acres.<br> In the shaft. He fell.<br> Where in the hell were you?<br> What's that supposed to mean?<br> I told you to keep<br> everybody rounded up!<br> - Mr. Rogo did the best he could...<br> - You don't have to defend me.<br> I've had just about enough from you.<br> Who do you think you are, God Himself?<br> - He was hurt and needed protection!<br> - So he was hurt!<br> The boat tilted and he fell!<br> The shaft blew up!<br> He's dead. That's it! Or do you<br> want to make something more out of it?<br> I said I'd get everybody out<br> and, goddamn it, I'll do it!<br> Mr. Scott, all those other people,<br> where were they going?<br> They're going toward the bow.<br> But they're wrong.<br> The bow's underwater!<br> How do you know?! Have you seen it?!<br> What makes you so damn sure<br> about everything?<br> If all those people<br> think they're right...<br> ...maybe we should go with them!<br> Not you!<br> That's brilliant!<br> Twenty people decide to drown,<br> so that's all right.<br> That's typical.<br> Everything by numbers...<br> - Stop it, Mike!<br> - He's been right so far.<br> Wait a minute.<br> May I make a suggestion, please?<br> The rest of us would feel more secure<br> if you two'd stop shouting!<br> Well, what do you want us to do?<br> I'm gonna make a deal with you.<br> I'm gonna go to the stern,<br> to the engine room.<br> And if it's passable,<br> we're gonna do it my way!<br> If not, we'll go forward.<br> You got it?!<br> Preacher!<br> You got 15 minutes.<br> If your ass isn't back here in 15 minutes,<br> we're going the other way.<br> You're on.<br> Wouldn't it be a good idea<br> to look around...<br> ...try to find things we might need,<br> like food or something?<br> - Yeah, sure, sure.<br> - Good.<br> All right. Start looking, everyone,<br> but stay in the area.<br> Nonnie, let's take a look.<br> Manny, wait a second.<br> I want to ask you something.<br> I'll follow Mr. Scott. Stay here.<br> No way. I'm gonna help find things.<br> Okay, but don't stray too far.<br> Manny, have you still<br> got your handkerchief?<br> It's not very clean.<br> Reverend Scott.<br> Mr. Scott.<br> Why aren't you with the others?<br> I'm scared.<br> I feel safer with you.<br> You are gonna get us out<br> of here, aren't you?<br> Oh, you bet I am, Susan.<br> You bet I am.<br> We can't get out this way. But we<br> went by a lot of other passages.<br> We'll look down every single one<br> until we find that engine room.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, come on.<br> We're never gonna see<br> our little grandson, are we?<br> Now, darling,<br> you have to think positively.<br> We'll see him. We'll see him.<br> If any of us are saved,<br> I hope it's those two children.<br> They still have their whole lives<br> in front of them.<br> Stop giving our lives away.<br> We'll come out of this. All of us.<br> Now you just sit here while I...<br> Manny...<br> ...you are a good man.<br> You're such a good man.<br> - Promise me something.<br> - Depends. What?<br> If I'm not back in five minutes,<br> tell the others that I was wrong.<br> Tell Mr. Rogo to do it his way.<br> Understand?<br> I promise, but you'll be back!<br> I'll be back.<br> Look at that.<br> A whole new idea of cutting hair.<br> Strap the customer in, push a button,<br> raise him up, flip him over...<br> ...let his hair hang down<br> and snip, snip, snip.<br> Yeah, snip, snip, snip.<br> My brother, Teddy, has lovely hair.<br> He's really dead...<br> ...isn't he?<br> I can't go on without him.<br> I can't.<br> Nonnie...<br> ...you will go on.<br> We do, you know.<br> We have to.<br> At first we don't think<br> it's possible...<br> ...but in time, believe me, in time...<br> ...you'll find other things,<br> other people.<br> Someone else to care for. You'll see.<br> - Brandy, rope, ax.<br> - We found these.<br> Good, good. Well, it's 17 minutes<br> and he ain't back.<br> - Sixteen minutes.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Can't we wait a few minutes longer?<br> - What for?<br> We're gonna move that way and fast.<br> Mr. Rogo!<br> - What's wrong? Where were you?<br> - With Mr. Scott.<br> We found a hatch. He thought<br> it might lead to the engine room.<br> So he told me if he wasn't back<br> in five minutes to tell you...<br> ...to do it your way.<br> - Come on, kid, pull yourself together.<br> Goddamn it, that does it!<br> We've been wasting time...<br> ...while we should have gone<br> up front with the rest.<br> Wait! After all he's done for us,<br> we can't leave without him.<br> - You act as if he's already dead.<br> - I agree.<br> He made a deal!<br> We're sticking to it!<br> We're going up front right now!<br> Let's move it!<br> I found it! I've been there.<br> Do you hear me, Rogo? I've seen<br> the engine room and the way out.<br> And it's this way. To use your words,<br> "Let's move it!" Come on.<br> Robin? Wait, where's Robin?<br> Last time I saw him, he went that way.<br> Wait, Susan, you take everybody<br> to the hatch. I'll find Robin.<br> - I can't without him.<br> - Will you trust me, huh?<br> You're the only one who knows<br> where the hatch is. I'll find Robin.<br> - That poor little boy.<br> - Keep going, he'll find him.<br> Robin, come here!<br> In here. Up that ladder.<br> - All right. Up you go.<br> - Not without my brother.<br> - Up you go.<br> - Wait.<br> - Get up there.<br> - Robin!<br> Oh, my God.<br> Get him up here!<br> Get up there, boy. Get up there.<br> Sorry, sis, had to go to the john.<br> - What a dumb, stupid way to die!<br> - I said, I'm sorry!<br> - Where do we go now?<br> - Down!<br> Close that watertight door!<br> Down? That can't be right.<br> I've been keeping track.<br> We've come up eight decks.<br> Each deck we passed flooded.<br> Not the engine room.<br> I've seen it. We go down!<br> This is no goddamn engine room!<br> Where the hell are we?<br> That corridor leads<br> to the engine room.<br> - But now it's underwater.<br> - So we'll swim. Give me the rope.<br> - You're kidding!<br> - She's right.<br> The engine room's<br> probably underwater too.<br> It's in the clear. It's one deck up.<br> I saw it. It's above us.<br> I'll swim up a companionway.<br> It's not more than 35 feet.<br> Oh, is that all?<br> We can do it. Believe me.<br> I'll tie the rope on the other end.<br> When I get there, I'll give a tug.<br> Pull yourself along the rope.<br> Take a deep breath.<br> It can't be more than 30 seconds.<br> - How long can you hold your breath?<br> - I don't know.<br> Do me a favor. Try it now.<br> - Mr. Rogo, time him.<br> - Go ahead.<br> Look at this. I was the underwater<br> swimming champ of New York...<br> ...for three years. I held<br> my breath for 2 minutes 47 seconds.<br> - Let me do this, please.<br> - You were 17 then.<br> You've all been dragging<br> and pulling me all this way.<br> Now I have a chance to do something<br> I know how to do.<br> Please, may I do this for everybody?<br> I'm perfectly capable of holding<br> my breath long enough to swim 35 feet.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey, hey, preacher.<br> Take a deep breath.<br> - Anybody timing him?<br> - I am.<br> He's swimming through corridors<br> and up and down stairwells.<br> I'm the only one here<br> trained to do that.<br> Will you shut up!<br> What makes you think you can do it?<br> You can ask anybody<br> in the Women's Swimming Association.<br> Just because I put on a little weight<br> doesn't mean I wasn't once an athlete.<br> - What time now?<br> - 39 seconds.<br> - What?<br> - The rope's not going through!<br> - Maybe he's there.<br> - Give him more time.<br> He said he'd tug on the rope.<br> What'll we do, goddamn it?<br> What'll we do?<br> Pull him back. Pull him back!<br> Give, you son of a bitch! Give!<br> Belle, be careful.<br> Manny, you think I'm planning<br> to be careless?<br> What does she think she's doing?<br> Let her go.<br> She knows what she's doing.<br> - She must have found him.<br> - Oh, thank God.<br> They did it. They must have made it.<br> You see, Mr. Scott, in the water,<br> I'm a very skinny lady.<br> They're not tugging!<br> Wait, wait, give them time.<br> I guess I'm not the champion...<br> ...of the Women's Swimming<br> Association anymore.<br> Hold on, Mrs. Rosen. Just hold on.<br> Mr. Scott...<br> ...enough is enough.<br> Let me go.<br> Please, let me go.<br> Give this to Manny.<br> Tell him he has to give it<br> to our grandson...<br> ...for both of us.<br> You see, that's the sign for life.<br> Life always matters very much.<br> Oh, God.<br> God, not this woman.<br> Oh, God, not this woman.<br> Something's happened.<br> Belle would've signaled.<br> - They've had enough time.<br> - That does it.<br> - I'll go find out what happened.<br> - No, you'll drown too!<br> - Let me go, it's my wife!<br> - Let him go.<br> I'm going through.<br> All of you stay put until I come back.<br> - Give me that flashlight.<br> - Mike, please!<br> Take it easy, baby, I'll be back.<br> What the hell happened?<br> You didn't pull on the rope.<br> I got trapped.<br> Mrs. Rosen freed me.<br> Thanks, Mrs. Rosen.<br> If it hadn't been for you, none of us...<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> Go back and get the others.<br> - What'll I tell him?<br> - Tell him nothing!<br> Just go back and get them!<br> You had a lot of guts, lady.<br> A lot of guts.<br> I'm okay, baby.<br> - I'm okay.<br> - Belle, is she all right?<br> She got through. She saved Scott.<br> She cleared the way for all of us.<br> She got through.<br> But something went wrong, didn't it?<br> Like I told you, she did everything.<br> Mr. Rosen, follow that rope!<br> Something did go wrong.<br> She got through. Now listen to me.<br> I want you all to step up here, take<br> deep breaths and swim along that rope.<br> You'll be in the engine room soon.<br> It is above water like<br> the preacher said. You kids first.<br> I can swim three pool lengths<br> underwater, but Sis can only do two.<br> Okay, kid.<br> Now don't forget.<br> Take a couple of deep breaths.<br> All right, go.<br> I can't swim.<br> You can't swim?<br> No, not a stroke.<br> Now you two.<br> Mr. Rogo, would you mind going?<br> I'll help her.<br> All right, but let's make it snappy.<br> No horsing around!<br> - You really can't swim at all?<br> - No, I can't.<br> - But you can hold your breath.<br> - Yes.<br> That's all you need.<br> Start taking deep breaths and hold<br> the last one before you go under.<br> And hang on to my belt.<br> I'll pull you through.<br> No.<br> You've got to, Nonnie.<br> I'm not leaving without you.<br> You really mean that, don't you?<br> Why don't we stay behind?<br> We don't have to follow the others.<br> What will happen?<br> - We might still be rescued.<br> - Maybe, maybe not.<br> You really won't leave me?<br> I'm not going without you.<br> I just have to hold my breath.<br> - That's all. And don't let go of me.<br> - No, I won't.<br> - Ready?<br> - No.<br> All right, now we'll take three deep<br> breaths and then we go.<br> Belle.<br> You all right, hon?<br> Help!<br> Get her!<br> Get up here!<br> Come on. Come on.<br> I've seen the propeller shaft opening.<br> We're almost home.<br> Only we must keep moving.<br> Now, come on.<br> - You bastard, ain't you got feelings?<br> - Now, look!<br> Listen to me, all of you.<br> Mrs. Rosen is dead.<br> We can't bring her back.<br> But what we can do is keep moving.<br> That's what she would've wanted!<br> So let's keep moving, come on!<br> Get up!<br> Get up, come on, let's keep moving.<br> Come on.<br> - You too, Mr. Rosen.<br> - No, my place is here with her.<br> God bless, Mrs. Rosen.<br> Look, Mr. Rosen...<br> The last thing she said to me was:<br> "Give this to Manny to give<br> to our grandson from both of us."<br> Your place is with the living.<br> If you don't come with us,<br> her death is meaningless.<br> Now come on.<br> All right...<br> ...but you go first.<br> I want to stay with her<br> just a while longer.<br> You got one minute.<br> All right, listen.<br> You see that red valve up there?<br> Beneath it is the entry<br> to the propeller shaft area.<br> The propeller shaft<br> is that silver thing.<br> And this catwalk is the way<br> we get up there.<br> Now follow me.<br> It's this way, Mr. Rosen!<br> This way!<br> We can't get through that way.<br> We'll have to go up.<br> Stay here.<br> One more door and we're home!<br> There it is, Mr. Rogo,<br> just like I told you!<br> - Come on!<br> - The little bastard was right.<br> Linda!<br> You! Preacher!<br> You lying, murdering son of a bitch!<br> You almost suckered me in!<br> I started to believe in your promises!<br> That we had a chance!<br> What chance?<br> You took from me...<br> ...the only thing I ever loved<br> in the whole world.<br> My Linda.<br> You killed her!<br> You killed her!<br> You killed her.<br> You killed her.<br> You killed her.<br> Mr. Scott, the hot steam!<br> It's blocking our escape!<br> What more do you want of us? We've<br> come all this way, no thanks to you!<br> We did it on our own,<br> no help from you!<br> We didn't ask you to fight for us!<br> But damn it, don't fight against us!<br> Leave us alone!<br> How many more sacrifices?<br> How much more blood?<br> How many more lives?!<br> Belle wasn't enough!<br> Acres wasn't!<br> Now this girl!<br> You want another life?<br> Then take me!<br> You can make it!<br> Keep going!<br> Rogo!<br> Get them through!<br> What are you doing?! Come here!<br> Susan. Now.<br> Get back here!<br> You can't help him now.<br> Susan, get back here!<br> Susan, come here!<br> Susan, come here!<br> Get up here. Get up here.<br> Come on. No.<br> What do you think you're doing?<br> You heard the reverend.<br> He said, "Get them through."<br> Well, go ahead. Get us through!<br> It'll be all right, sis.<br> It'll be all right.<br> What kind of a policeman were you?<br> You've done nothing but beef<br> and complain.<br> Always negative. Always destructive.<br> Well, now's your chance to do<br> something positive for a change.<br> Are you quitting, Mr. Rogo?<br> Are you going out with a whimper?<br> On your belly?<br> All right, you, that's enough!<br> Pull yourself together, Susan. Robin,<br> take care of your sister. Go ahead.<br> Nonnie, follow them.<br> Are you coming, Mr. Rosen?<br> Watch it around this door. It's hot.<br> All right, now what? Dead end.<br> Excuse me, sir, but I don't think so.<br> - You don't think what, kid?<br> - You see, sir, I tried to tell you.<br> We're in Shaft Alley.<br> Nowhere is the steel hull thinner.<br> - This hull is only one-inch thick.<br> - All right...<br> Quiet! I think I hear something.<br> My God, there's somebody out there!<br> Hold it!<br> Again.<br> Hold it, hold it.<br> Again.<br> Stop it, stop it! It's no use!<br> No, keep trying!<br> Mr. Scott wouldn't have stopped.<br> Let's go!<br> Hold it, hold it.<br> My God, there is somebody up there.<br> The preacher was right. The beautiful<br> son of a bitch was right!<br> Look. Look!<br> Get back. Get back.<br> - How many of you down there?<br> - Six.<br> Is that all?<br> Did you save anybody else?<br> Anyone from the bow?<br> No.<br>
