Indeed.<br> - One...<br> For those who like that sort of thing,<br> that is the sort of thing they like.<br> You may sit down, Emily.<br> And this is Mary McGregor.<br> Well, what about you, Mary?<br> You don't look to me like a girl who ties knots.<br> N-N-No, Miss Brodie, but my b-b-brother does.<br> That is as it should be.<br> But what about you?<br> What are your interests?<br> I haven't g-got any.<br> I d-d-don't think.<br> That is what I am for,<br> Mary McGregor...<br> to provide you<br> with interests.<br> You may sit down now, Mary.<br> Little girls, I am in the business<br> of putting old heads on young shoulders.<br> All my pupils are<br> the crme de la crme.<br> Give me a girl<br> at an impressionable age...<br> and she is mine for life.<br> You girls are my vocation.<br> If I were to receive<br> a proposal of marriage tomorrow...<br> from the Lord Lyon, king of arms,<br> I would decline it.<br> I am dedicated<br> to you in my prime.<br> And my summer in Italy<br> has convinced me...<br> that I am truly<br> in my prime.<br> Emily, Mary McGregor,<br> you are new to this institution.<br> It is possible you will hear my teaching<br> methods decried in certain quarters...<br> as being unsuitable for a conservative<br> school like Marcia Blaine.<br> That is to say, a school dedicated<br> to the status quo.<br> Can anyone define<br> "status quo"?<br> Sandy?<br> Does it mean staying the same,<br> Miss Brodie?<br> Precisely.<br> Staying the same to the point<br> of petrification.<br> P-E-T-R-I-F...<br> I-C-A-T-I-O-N.<br> Petrification.<br> I do not intend to devote<br> my prime to petrification.<br> Prop up your books<br> in case of intruders.<br> If there are intruders,<br> we are doing our history.<br> But we will not<br> do our history.<br> Can anyone tell me who is<br> the greatest Italian painter?<br> Leonardo da Vinci,<br> Miss Brodie.<br> That is incorrect,Jenny.<br> The answer is Giotto.<br> He is my favorite.<br> Observe, little girls,<br> Stanley Baldwin...<br> who got in as prime minister<br> and got out again ere long.<br> Our headmistress,<br> Miss Mackay...<br> retains him on the walls because<br> she believes in the slogan "safety first".<br> Safety does not come first.<br> Goodness, Truth<br> and Beauty come first.<br> One's prime brings one's insight<br> into these things.<br> One's prime is the moment<br> one is born for.<br> You little girls must be<br> on the alert to recognize your prime...<br> at whatever time<br> it may occur...<br> and live it to the full.<br> "Season of mist<br> and mellow fruitfulness".<br> I want to tell you<br> of a moment in my life...<br> when I was very young...<br> younger even<br> than the man himself.<br> His name was Hugh.<br> I fell deeply in love<br> with Hugh...<br> in the last year<br> of the war...<br> but he fell<br> on Flanders field.<br> Helen McPhee, are you thinking<br> of doing a day's washing?<br> - No, Miss Brodie.<br> - You have your sleeves rolled up.<br> Roll them down at once.<br> I won't have to do with girls...<br> who roll up the sleeves<br> of their blouses.<br> We are civilized beings.<br> He fell on Flanders field.<br> He fell the week before<br> armistice was declared.<br> He fell like an autumn leaf.<br> Remind me to show you a map of Flanders<br> and the spot where my lover...<br> was laid to sleep forever,<br> before you were born.<br> "Come autumn so pensive<br> in yellow and gray...<br> and soothe me with tidings<br> of nature's decay".<br> Robert Burns.<br> Hugh fell<br> like an autumn leaf.<br> After the armistice,<br> people were dancing and singing forjoy...<br> in the streets, but...<br> Hugh was one of the flowers<br> of the forest...<br> lying in his grave.<br> What seems to be<br> ailing the spirits of...<br> Monica Maclaren,<br> isn't it?<br> Monica cries easily.<br> Well, Monica, perhaps you can<br> tell me why you are crying.<br> She's moved by a story<br> I have been telling...<br> of the Battle of Flodden.<br> Crying over<br> a history lesson?<br> It is a moving story.<br> The night before Flodden,<br> at Mercat Cross beside St. Giles...<br> a ghostly herald was heard<br> reading the names...<br> of all the noble families of Scotland<br> beginning with the king.<br> After the battle,<br> there was not one family...<br> who had not suffered<br> grievous loss...<br> as you well know,<br> Miss Mackay.<br> To be sure.<br> Well, girls, I know you're all<br> going to work hard...<br> at every subject<br> this year.<br> A good beginning<br> makes a good ending.<br> I hope you all<br> had splendid holidays...<br> and I look forward to reading<br> your splendid essays...<br> on how you spent them.<br> You shouldn't be crying<br> over a history lesson at your age.<br> My word.<br> Thank you,Janet.<br> Good morning,<br> Miss Mackay.<br> You may sit down, girls.<br> You did well, Monica,<br> not to answer the question put to you.<br> It is well when in difficulties<br> to say never a word...<br> neither black<br> nor white.<br> But you did,<br> Miss Brodie.<br> You were in difficulty,<br> and you made up about Flodden.<br> Sandy, please try to do as I say<br> and not as I do.<br> Remember, you are<br> a child, Sandy...<br> and far from your prime.<br> - I hear I must congratulate you on the birth of another child.<br> - Yes, another daughter.<br> Have you never heard<br> of Marie Stopes...<br> architect for constructive birth control<br> and racial progress?<br> Ah, yes. An estimable woman. But my church<br> enjoins me to go forth and be fruitful.<br> I'm aware of your unfortunate affiliation<br> with the Church of Rome.<br> I doubt, however,<br> whether that body gives...<br> the same interpretation<br> to go forth that you do.<br> My church understands human imperfection<br> and forgives it. Why can't you?<br> I am not interested in human imperfection.<br> I am interested in Beauty, in Art, in Truth.<br> In Art and Beauty, maybe.<br> In truth, no.<br> This is outrageous!<br> The truth is that you bounced<br> into bed with an artist...<br> ... but you were horrified,<br> when you woke up with a man!<br> - R-Release me instantly!<br> - I finished your portrait,Jean.<br> - Come back to the studio. Come Sunday.<br> - I can't. I can't.<br> - Why not?<br> - I have another engagement!<br> - Well, break it!<br> - I can't possibly!<br> - I'm-I'm... I'm going to Cramond.<br> - What for?<br> Mr. Lowther has invited me<br> to his estate at Cramond.<br> - Lowther?<br> - He has a small boat.<br> I'm invited<br> to go sailing...<br> on Sunday.<br> What do you want me to do...<br> ravish you on the floor...<br> for the edification<br> of your girls?<br> - Here.<br> - Is this liver paste, Miss Brodie?<br> It is pt de foie gras.<br> Pt de foie gras.<br> Oh, it must be marvelous<br> to be French.<br> The French have<br> a genius for food...<br> but I doubt French women<br> will ever get the vote.<br> I was quite emphatic about it.<br> "I'll not pull my punches, Miss Mackay",<br> I said.<br> "Miss Brodie's girls are different".<br> - Oh, you said that?<br> - Oh, I said it, all right...<br> and I meant it.<br> Thank you,<br> Miss Lockhart.<br> The Brodie set, indeed.<br> Wee girls refusing<br> to wash their faces.<br> Oh, Miss Brodie,<br> they informed me...<br> hasn't washed her face<br> in 20 years.<br> She looks clean enough<br> from here.<br> Miss Brodie prescribes<br> cold cream.<br> She always looks<br> so extreme.<br> This is my new girl,<br> Mr. Lowther, Mary McGregor.<br> Mr. Lowther. There's a great deal<br> Mr. Lowther can teach you...<br> about the modulation<br> of your tones.<br> Oh!<br> Miss Brodie, I thought... that is,<br> I hoped there might be time...<br> for a wee cup of tea in the common room<br> before the afternoon classes.<br> Oh!<br> how nice of you<br> to ask me, Mr. Lowther.<br> Now, girls, I leave<br> Mary McGregor in your charge.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, Mary McGregor,<br> how much pocket money do you get?<br> O-O-One and six a week.<br> One and six?<br> Your father gives you one and six?<br> M-M-Mr. Ealing<br> gives it to me.<br> I don't have<br> a f-f-father or mother.<br> - Who's Mr. Ealing?<br> - At the b-b-bank. He's our guardian.<br> He takes care<br> of the m-m-money.<br> Well, I'd like to be an orphan heiress<br> and get my pocket money...<br> from bankers that<br> don't know any better.<br> Does your brother<br> get one and six too?<br> I d-d-don't know.<br> He's 14.<br> My b-b-brother<br> has run away...<br> from four schools.<br> Your brother sounds<br> like a bad lot.<br> So I thought that this Sunday...<br> I would treat myself<br> to one last day...<br> of sun and water.<br> I wonder, Mr. Lowther,<br> if you might be able to help me.<br> - In what way, Miss Brodie?<br> - Why, you might know if there's any possibility...<br> of my renting<br> a little boat at Cramond.<br> Oh, well, Miss Brodie,<br> I have a boat.<br> Oh, do you, Mr. Lowther?<br> It would give me<br> the greatest pleasure, uh...<br> I mean, i-if you would consider<br> coming with me.<br> Oh, but I couldn't<br> trouble you, Mr. Lowther.<br> Trouble? Oh, Miss Brodie,<br> I would have asked you before many times...<br> but I... I didn't want<br> to seem to push myself.<br> Please, Miss Brodie,<br> say you'll come with me.<br> Very well, Mr. Lowther.<br> On Sunday?<br> On Sunday.<br> After church, of course.<br> Oh, of course, Mr. Lowther.<br> Do you think Mr. Lloyd<br> is the crme de la crme...<br> or Mr. Lowther?<br> Neither. It's us.<br> "Little girls, if you will<br> only listen to me...<br> I will make of you<br> the crme de la crme."<br> My father says these are<br> the happiest days of our lives.<br> But if these are supposed<br> to be the happiest...<br> why does Miss Brodie<br> say prime is best?<br> Miss Brodie never got married<br> like our mothers and fathers.<br> - They don't have primes.<br> - They have sexual intercourse.<br> - Oh, I don't like to think about it.<br> - You don't have to.<br> It happens on<br> the spur of the moment.<br> You lead.<br> - How do you know?<br> - About what?<br> What you were saying... about how sexual<br> intercourse happens on the spur of the moment.<br> Because it happened to Teenie,<br> that works in my father's shop...<br> when she was out walking<br> at Puddocky with her boyfriend.<br> They had to get married.<br> You'd think the urge would have passed<br> by the time they'd got their clothes off.<br> Yes. That's what<br> I can't understand.<br> People take their clothes off<br> in front of each other.<br> It's so rude.<br> They're bound to be<br> put off their passion.<br> Do you think Miss Brodie<br> ever had sexual intercourse...<br> with Hugh of Flanders field...<br> before he fell?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't think<br> they did anything like that.<br> Their love<br> was above all that.<br> Well, Miss Brodie said<br> they clung to each other...<br> with passionate abandon<br> on his last leave.<br> I don't think they took<br> their clothes off though. Do you?<br> No. I can't see it.<br> Observe, little girls,<br> the castle.<br> It is built on a rock<br> of volcanic plug.<br> It was through<br> one of yon windows...<br> that Mary, Queen of Scots<br> lowered her infant son...<br> straight down 187 feet<br> in a basket in a high wind.<br> Mary McGregor, will you please<br> do up your shoelace?<br> Oh.

Yes.<br> We must away and catch our tram.<br> I doubt we will get seats.<br> It is 1932, and chivalry is dead.<br> Miss Brodie?<br> I do want you to come and see<br> the picture, the one I told you about.<br> What about<br> next weekend?<br> - No. I'm afraid I'm going...<br> - Going to Cramond?<br> Why, yes. My girls and I spend nearly<br> every weekend at Cramond.<br> Mr. Lowther<br> is most hospitable.<br> Good afternoon,<br> Mr. Lloyd.<br> Come along, girls.<br> Got it!<br> There we are.<br> - Oh, there's some nice ones up here.<br> - No. Get one.<br> - I'm watching. It's all right.<br> - Watch out.<br> Thank you.<br> Crepe de Chine.<br> Miss Brodie's legs<br> are longer than Mr. Lowther's.<br> She'd have to<br> wrap hers around his.<br> First he puts out<br> the light.<br> Then their toes touch.<br> Then...<br> "Miss Brodie, Miss Brodie".<br> Miss Brodie says,<br> "Darling".<br> - She says...<br> - "Mr. Lowther...<br> you are<br> the crme de la crme".<br> We will have to watch<br> Miss Brodie's stomach.<br> It is the curve<br> I am attempting to introduce you to.<br> The curve here<br> in this drape...<br> and here,<br> and here in the arm.<br> The curve flows through<br> a painting like a river.<br> It is sinuous, sensuous...<br> epitomizing everything<br> that is female.<br> The curve is<br> a beckoning line...<br> here, and here.<br> And here,<br> in the breast.<br> And the belly!<br> And the buttocks!<br> Shut up!<br> Go on.<br> Get along with you.<br> Go to your sewing classes and your<br> singing lessons.

Yours truly, J. Brodie".<br> A postcard from my passionate,<br> abandoned inamorata.<br> That night<br> at the studio...<br> that one night<br> at the studio...<br> I was pleased to feel it was I<br> who enjoyed the tutorial position.<br> Come back,Jean.<br> I need you.<br> M-M-M...<br> Mary McGregor!<br> Mary McGregor, do you know<br> what happened to Peeping Tom?<br> His eyes were shriveled<br> into darkness in his head...<br> and dropped before him!<br> Poor old Tom.<br> Don't worry, Jean. You've got your girls<br> well trained. You're safe from that quarter.<br> It's me you've got<br> to worry about.<br> Come to the studio.<br> Come to pose again.<br> - Only to pose.<br> - You should paint one of my girls.<br> - Jenny is the pretty one.<br> - Hang your girls. It's you I want to paint.<br> I will not come<br> to the studio.<br> Then to hell with you!<br> Teddy, you know,<br> you really should paintJenny.<br> You'd likeJenny.<br> She has a profile...<br> of deceptive purity.<br> What's the matter with you, Mary?<br> What's happened to you?<br> Your face is all funny.<br> N-No, it's not.<br> Yes, it is, Mary.<br> Very funny.<br> So is your voice.<br> Well, well.<br> Miss Brodie's brood, I presume.<br> Yes, Mr. Lloyd.<br> - Would you like a rosebud?<br> - A what?<br> It's the favorite sweet<br> of little Princess Margaret Rose.<br> Unmistakably Brodie.<br> And you, I suppose,<br> are the pretty one.<br> Good afternoon, girls.<br> Mary, you're definitely<br> upset about something.<br> - N-No.<br> - Tell! Tell, or I'll pinch you.<br> - Tell.<br> - No, I w-won't tell.<br> I love Miss Brodie,<br> and I won't t-tell.<br> What about Miss Brodie?<br> Tell, or we'll take you<br> into the locker room...<br> - and hang you over the banisters.<br> - You wouldn't d-dare.<br> - Tell!<br> - It's n-none of your b-b-business!<br> Ow! Ow!<br> No! Stop!<br> Get your hands off of me! Help!<br> - Let go of me!<br> - Aaah! No!<br> If you scream again...<br> we'll drop you squoosh<br> on your silly head.<br> Mary, dear, if something's happened<br> with Miss Brodie, you should tell me.<br> - What have you done?<br> - She was s-so angry!<br> Well, you know<br> how you are, Mary.<br> - What have you done now?<br> - Nothing.<br> I j-j-just went in.<br> - In where?<br> - The classroom!<br> So?<br> There they were!<br> - There who were?<br> - Oh, Mr. Lowther.!<br> Miss Brodie<br> and Mr. Lowther.!<br> No! M-M-Mr. Lloyd!<br> They were kissing!<br> Kissing?<br> I saw them k-k-kissing...<br> together.<br> - He had his arms around her.<br> - Mr. Lloyd!<br> Mr. Lloyd! Mr. Lloyd's<br> in love with Miss Brodie!<br> And she's in I-love<br> with M-Mr. Lloyd.<br> You should have<br> s-seen them.<br> But what about<br> Mr. Lowther then?<br> Mr. Lloyd is an artist.<br> And Miss Brodie's artistic too.<br> Miss Brodie's really in love with<br> Mr. Lloyd, but he's married to another...<br> so she's working it off<br> on Mr. Lowther.<br> - Oh.<br> - Let's go home.<br> Listen, Mary.<br> Was it a long,<br> lingering kiss?<br> I shouldn't have<br> t-told you.<br> But since you did,<br> was it a long, lingering kiss?<br> - Yes.<br> - I see.<br> - Didn't they hear you?<br> - I d-don't think so.<br> They jumped apart though.<br> You mean,<br> they sensed your presence?<br> I d-d-don't know.<br> Was it like this...<br> That's it! That's it!<br> It's nearly 5:00. Time you girls were away.<br> What were you doing, Sandy?<br> - Just playacting, Miss Mackay.<br> - Playacting at what?<br> - Opera.<br> - Opera?<br> Yes, Miss Mackay.<br> We've been studying Traviata.<br> Sandy, show me<br> what you were doing.<br> Go on. Show me.<br> That's enough, Sandy.<br> She was doing Violetta<br> expiring for love of Alfredo.<br> - It's very sad.<br> - Oh, nonsense.<br> Violetta did not expire<br> for love of Alfredo.<br> Violetta was a thoroughly silly woman<br> with diseased lungs.<br> If she'd been properly<br> brought up...<br> she'd have been out on the hockey field,<br> breathing deeply.<br> Which is precisely what<br> you little girls should be doing.<br> Traviata is not<br> on the Marcia Blaine curriculum.<br> But Miss Brodie and Mr. Lowther<br> took us to see Traviata...<br> when the Carl Rosa Company<br> came to Edinburgh.<br> Miss Brodie and Mr. Lowther<br> took you to the opera?<br> Mr. Lowther's jolly nice.<br> We go to visit him at Cramond too.<br> When Miss Brodie goes...<br> on weekends.<br> How very nice<br> of Mr. Lowther...<br> and Miss Brodie.<br> I hope you're appreciative.<br> My, my. Miss Brodie's very musical,<br> I believe...<br> theaters, concerts<br> and the opera.<br> Miss Brodie<br> is very musical.<br> I think Miss Brodie's<br> more interested in art, Miss Mackay.<br> Now, what makes you think<br> Miss Brodie prefers art to music, Sandy?<br> She told us so.<br> Music is an interest to her,<br> but painting is a passion.<br> Miss Brodie said.<br> - A passion?<br> - Compared to music.<br> Well, Mary...<br> I'm sure you're too young<br> to have passions.<br> - What are your cultural interests?<br> - Stories.<br> Does Miss Brodie<br> tell you stories?<br> Oh, yes.<br> L-L-Love...<br> Lovely stories.<br> - Stories like Traviata?<br> - Stories of history.<br> - History.<br> - She makes history seem like the cinema.<br> - No. Not the cinema. More like Shakespeare.<br> - Shakespeare.<br> Indeed.<br> My, what would we do<br> without Miss Brodie?<br> I could wish<br> your arithmetic papers were better.<br> Culture is no compensation<br> for lack ofhard knowledge.<br> I'm happy to see you are devoted<br> to Miss Brodie.<br> Your loyalty is also<br> due to the school.<br> I'm always impressed<br> by Miss Brodie's girls...<br> in one way or another.<br> Benito Mussolini<br> is a great man.<br> He began life<br> as a journalist...<br> a man of learning,<br> an intellectual...<br> but he is also<br> a man of action.<br> He has made Capri<br> into a sanctuary for birds.<br> A simple act of goodness.<br> If you all turn to page 25 of your<br> geography books,you'll find a map of Capri.<br> It's off the coast of Naples.<br> It is because of II Duce<br> thousands of birds live and sing there today...<br> that might well have ended<br> their careers on a piece of toast.<br> Miss Gaunt,<br> is there something you wanted?<br> Thank you.<br> "Dear Miss Brodie,<br> I hope it will be convenient for you...<br> "to see me in my office<br> this afternoon at 4:15.<br> Emmaline Mackay".<br> Not 4:30, but 4:15.<br> She thinks to intimidate me,<br> by the use of quarter hours.<br> Now, as I was<br> attempting to say...<br> Benito Mussolini<br> is indeed a man of action.<br> Come in.<br> I might be late, or early.<br> Not at all.<br> You are most punctilious.<br> Thank you<br> for finding the time.<br> I know how busy<br> your girls keep you.<br> - Please, sit down.<br> - Oh. Thank you.<br> What a colorful frock.<br> Color enlivens the spirit,<br> does it not?<br> Perhaps you're right, though I wonder<br> if the spirits of the girls need enlivening.<br> Oh, indeed they do!<br> My credo is,<br> "Lift, enliven, stimulate"<br> No doubt.<br> But the Marcia Blaine School...<br> is essentially<br> a conservative school.<br> We do not encourage<br> the, uh, progressive attitudes.<br> Now, Miss Brodie,<br> I have noticed...<br> a spirit of precocity among your girls...<br> your special girls.<br> - Why, thank you.<br> - Oh.<br> I am in my prime...<br> and my girls are<br> benefiting from it.<br> I'm proud to think that perhaps<br> my girls are more aware.<br> - Precisely. Now...<br> - To me, education is a leading out.<br> The word education comes<br> from the root "ex", meaning "out",<br> and "duco": "I lead".<br> To me, education is simply a...<br> a leading out...<br> of what is<br> already there.<br> I had hoped there might also be<br> a certain amount of putting in.<br> That would not be education,<br> but intrusion...<br> from the root prefix "in",<br> meaning "in",<br> and the stem "trudo": "I thrust".<br> Ergo, to thrust a lot<br> of information into a pupil's head.<br> To discuss education with such<br> a dedicated teacher...<br> is always instructive.<br> However, it was not for that reason<br> I asked you to come here.<br> Miss Brodie...<br> I am told that you make<br> weekly expeditions to Cramond.<br> Yes. Isn't it<br> a lovely spot?<br> It is, indeed.<br> I believe Mr. Lowther inherited<br> the estate from his mother.<br> He's lived there<br> all his life.<br> Mr. Lowther is not<br> a worldly man...<br> not a reckless man.<br> It is doubtful whether he would<br> recognize recklessness in others.<br> And recklessness<br> is an indulgence...<br> that we at Marcia Blaine<br> must eschew...<br> not only within our walls,<br> but in the personal life...<br> the conduct, as it were,<br> of the teaching staff.<br> Oh, Miss Mackay...<br> I do not believe I have<br> ever fully appreciated...<br> the taxing load of trivia...<br> with which a headmistress<br> must concern herself.<br> I must concern myself, Miss Brodie,<br> with this school's board of governors.<br> I flatter myself that I am not<br> unknown to the board...<br> having been a member<br> of the staff of Marcia Blaine...<br> six years prior<br> to your engagement, Miss Mackay.<br> I feel quite safe in saying...<br> that no member of the board<br> has ever shown anything...<br> but appreciation and approval<br> of my teaching methods.<br> Oh! Oh, Miss Mackay...<br> I use the woods of Cramond<br> for lessons in botany...<br> the rocks of the shore to investigate<br> the mysteries of geology.<br> It should be patently clear<br> that my expeditions to Cramond...<br> are expeditions for enrichment.<br> Enrichment for my girls...<br> and for Marcia Blaine.<br> Well.<br> Thank you, Miss Brodie.<br> I feel sure you and I have come<br> to understand each other better.<br> I'm always<br> at your command, Miss Mackay.<br> I am delighted<br> to hear it.<br> Good day, Miss Brodie.<br> Oh, chrysanthemums.<br> Such serviceable flowers.<br> Mmm.<br> May I have a word with you,<br> Miss Gaunt?<br> Miss Gaunt, you are, of course,<br> aware of the problem...<br> when a teacher has tenure<br> and the loyalty of her pupils.<br> It's not going to<br> be easy, Miss Gaunt.<br> However, no doubt,<br> in due time...<br> some advantage will<br> be vouchsafed us.<br> In the meanwhile, I would deem it<br> a sincere service to the school...<br> if any indiscretion<br> that might reach your ears...<br> should also reach mine.<br> Also, your brother...<br> is a deacon of Cramond Kirk,<br> is he not...<br> and naturally eager<br> to preserve its sanctity?<br> Thank you, Miss Gaunt.<br> What are you writing?<br> "My dear, delightful Gordon...<br> your letter has moved me deeply,<br> as you may imagine.<br> But, alas, I must ever decline<br> to be Mrs. Lowther.<br> My reasons<br> are twofold...<br> I am dedicated to my girls,<br> as is madame Pavlova...<br> and there is another<br> in my life.<br> He is Teddy Lloyd".<br> Here. Let me. Let me.<br> "But we can still have...<br> many a breezy day<br> in the fishing boat...<br> at sea".<br> - Shh!<br> - What are you two girls up to?<br> Gather your things together,<br> and leave at once.<br> This is a library,<br> not a fun fair!<br> - Are those your books?<br> - No, Miss McKenzie.<br> I want you to remember, girls...<br> that it is<br> of primary importance...<br> that the upper<br> and lower tensions...<br> are perfectly even.<br> And secondly, girls,<br> it is most important...<br> to ensure that<br> you are using...<br> the correct length<br> of stitch.<br> If we were to fill this room<br> with the hydrogen being made in thesejars...<br> and then<br> strike a match...<br> there'd be an explosion large enough<br> to reduce this building to rubble.<br> Look.

Now,Jenny,<br> do us a cartwheel for comic relief.<br> - Oh! Wonderful!<br> - Bravo. Bravo! Bravo!<br> Bravo!

Uh,<br> Jenny just left, you see.<br> Mr. Lloyd's studio.<br> Whatever were you doing there?<br> It was supposed<br> to be a surprise.<br> Jenny is sitting<br> for Mr. Lloyd.<br> Jenny is sitting<br> for Mr. Lloyd...<br> And I wasn't...<br> When did this begin?<br> - At the start of term. I shouldn't have told you.<br> - Jean...<br> Oh, I'm very glad<br> you did tell me, Sandy.<br> You are developing into a girl<br> of great insight.<br> - Thank you, Miss Brodie.<br> - You know, Sandy...<br> I would be very interested to hear<br> your own impressions ofJenny's portrait.<br> But we won't discuss it<br> with the others.<br> So Monday, after school,<br> you'll come to my flat for tea.<br> We'll have a nice,<br> quiet time together.<br> Yes, Miss Brodie.<br> Well, come now. I'm sure<br> Mr. Lowther will take you home.<br> In you get, Sandy.<br> Can you manage, dear?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - Thank you, Gordon.<br> - You're very kind.<br> - Oh, you're more than welcome.<br> It's a painting<br> of Mr. Lloyd's family.<br> It starts with himself<br> and his wife...<br> and then all the children graded downwards<br> to the baby and the dog on the floor.<br> It's supposed to be funny...<br> but the funniest part is,<br> they all look like you.<br> Like me?<br> Yes. Even the baby.<br> Everybody he paints<br> looks like you.<br> Hmm.<br> You shall butter the scones,<br> Sandy, dear.<br> Be generous.<br> Uh, does the portrait<br> of Jenny look like me?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Mr. Lloyd might want<br> to paint me too.<br> I doubt if having your portrait painted<br> is going to be your career.<br> Would you mind shutting the window, dear?<br> There's a wee bit of a draft.<br> What do you think<br> it will be, Miss Brodie?<br> Uh, what do I think<br> what will be?<br> My career.<br> Well, you're quite<br> intelligent, of course.<br> Actually, Sandy, you have<br> something more than mere intelligence.<br> You have insight.<br> There goes Miss Lockhart.<br> The chemistry teacher?<br> Yes. She's got<br> her golf clubs.<br> Monica saw Mr. Lowther<br> playing golf with Miss Lockhart...<br> twice.<br> Indeed?<br> Well, I know very little<br> of, uh, Miss Lockhart.<br> I leave her<br> to her jars and gases.<br> We were talking<br> about your insight, Sandy.<br> You do have insight...<br> and Jenny...<br> has got instinct.<br> Jenny will be<br> a great lover.<br> She's like a heroine from a novel<br> by Mr. D.H. Lawrence.<br> The common moral code will not<br> apply to her. She will be above it.<br> This is a fact which only someone<br> with your insight should know about.<br> You know, Sandy...<br> you would make an excellent<br> secret service agent...<br> a great spy.<br> Sandy, you must try<br> not to peer at people.<br> It makes a most<br> rude impression.<br> Why do you think I would<br> make a good spy, Miss Brodie?<br> Well, because you are intelligent<br> and not... emotional.<br> I've observed this<br> constraint in you.<br> It has, from time to time,<br> distressed me...<br> as I myself am a...<br> deeply emotional woman.<br> I feel many things<br> passionately.<br> I feel things,<br> Miss Brodie.<br> Well, everybody does,<br> of course.<br> It's simply<br> a matter of degree.<br> Actually, passion would be<br> a great handicap to a spy.<br> - It would?<br> - Definitely.<br> What did you mean<br> when you said that, uh...<br> Jenny was above<br> the common moral code?<br> Oh, simply that it<br> will not apply to her.<br> She is the exception...<br> and we can helpJenny<br> to realize this.<br> - Oh, Sandy, dear, I forgot the hot water.<br> - I'll get it.<br> Thank you, dear.<br> Miss Brodie, how do you think<br> that we can helpJenny?<br> We can encourage her,<br> give her confidence.<br> Confidence for what?<br> For when she is 18.<br> With a girl likeJenny...<br> perhaps even 17.<br> Soon she will...<br> know love.<br> Do you<br> understand that, Sandy?<br> You mean<br> she'll have affairs...<br> love affairs.<br> Oh, Sandy,<br> you do have insight.<br> I am never wrong.<br> I can always<br> depend on you.<br> Little girls, you must all learn<br> to cultivate an expression of composure.<br> It is one of<br> the greatest assets of a woman...<br> an expression of composure,<br> come foul, come fair.<br> Regard the Mona Lisa.<br> She's older than the rocks<br> on which she sits.<br> Whom did I say to regard,<br> Clara?<br> The Mona Lisa, Miss Brodie.<br> That is correct.<br> Clara has artistic tendencies.<br> Little girls, I am in the business of putting<br> old heads on young shoulders.<br> And all my pupils<br> are the crme de la crme.<br> Jean!<br> Oh,Jean!<br> - Mr. Lowther!<br> - Jean... Uh...<br> Miss Brodie. Miss Mackay. I've just left her.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Did you wish to speak<br> to me about something?<br> What can you be<br> up to, Gordon?<br> Such a display<br> in front of the children.<br> It's Miss Mackay.<br> She dismissed my class!<br> She's found something terrible!<br> Something incriminating!<br> She demands to see us<br> both together immediately! Immediately.<br> I am not accustomed to being<br> summoned immediately. Not by anyone.<br> But,Jean, she sent me to get you!<br> She said now.<br> Please!<br> Pull yourself together, Gordon.<br> I promise I won't let<br> Miss Mackay stand you in the corner.<br> Just you wait there<br> a minute.<br> Well, your headmistress,<br> Miss Mackay...<br> wishes to see me<br> for a few minutes.<br> She has a wee problem<br> she wishes to discuss with me.<br> Now, what subject<br> were we doing?<br> - History, Miss Brodie.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Open your history books.<br> While I'm away<br> from the room...<br> you will all read the chapter on<br> the succession of the Stuarts.<br> You will sit quietly in your seats<br> and remain composed...<br> like the Mona Lisa.<br> Miss Brodie, do you<br> know what this is?<br> It would appear to be a piece of blue paper<br> with writing on it in pencil.<br> It is, in fact,<br> a letter.<br> It was found by Miss McKenzie<br> in a library book.<br> She glanced at it, but after the first<br> sentence, she dared not actually read it.<br> She brought it<br> instantly to me.<br> Yes.<br> Is it addressed to you?<br> No, Miss Brodie.<br> It's addressed to Mr. Lowther...<br> but it is signed<br> by you.<br> - I shall begin.<br> - Oh, please do.<br> Of course, I realize<br> it is a forgery...<br> just the work<br> of a child.<br> "My dear, delightful Gordon...<br> your letter has moved me deeply,<br> as you may imagine...<br> but, alas, I must ever decline<br> to be Mrs. Lowther.<br> My reasons are twofold.<br> I am dedicated<br> to my girls...<br> as is<br> madame Pavlova...<br> and there is another in my life...<br> he is Teddy Lloyd.<br> Intimacy has never taken place with him.<br> He is married to another.<br> We are not lovers,<br> but we know the truth.<br> However, I was proud of giving myself to you<br> when you came and took me...<br> in the bracken while<br> the storm raged about us.<br> If I am in<br> a certain condition...<br> I shall place the infant in the care<br> of a worthy shepherd and his wife.<br> I may permit misconduct to occur again<br> from time to time as an outlet...<br> because I am in my prime.<br> We can also have many a... breezy day<br> in the fishing boat at sea.<br> We must keep a sharp lookout for Miss Mackay,<br> however, as she's rather narrow...<br> which arises from an ignorance of culture<br> and the Italian scene.<br> I love to hear you singing<br> "Hey,Johnny Cope".<br> But were I to receive<br> a proposal of marriage tomorrow...<br> from the Lord Lyon, king of arms,<br> I would decline it.<br> Allow me,<br> in conclusion...<br> to congratulate you warmly on your<br> sexual intercourse as well as your singing.<br> With fondestjoy,<br> Jean Brodie".<br> Is this what your girls,<br> your set...<br> has learned under your auspices,<br> Miss Brodie?<br> It's a literary collaboration.<br> Two separate hands are involved.<br> One of the authors<br> slants her tail consonants...<br> in an unorthodox manner,<br> and the other does not.<br> Also, the paper seems<br> somewhat aged.<br> Is that all<br> you have to say?<br> What else<br> is there to say?<br> Two little girls at the age<br> of budding sexual fantasy...<br> have concocted a romance<br> for themselves.<br> They've chosen me as a romantic symbol.<br> Is that so surprising?<br> Do you deny that you encourage<br> these fantasies, as you call them?<br> Do you deny that by consorting openly<br> with Mr. Lowther of Cramond...<br> you lead these poor children<br> into the most fevered conclusions?<br> Not only Mr. Lowther, but Mr. Lloyd<br> is brought into the circle of fire.<br> Mr. Lloyd, who has<br> a wife and... six children.<br> It is diabolic that infants should<br> be knowledgeable...<br> are not infants, Miss Mackay.<br> - How do you know they're 12 years old?<br> - From the handwriting...<br> the vocabulary, the rudimentary<br> knowledge of the facts of life.<br> Oh, surely you cannot believe that that is<br> the work of 9-year-olds?<br> I could believe it was the work<br> of your 9-year-olds, Miss Brodie.<br> There's very little<br> for me to say, Miss Mackay...<br> in the face of your<br> extraordinary prejudice and hostility.<br> Miss Brodie, I am not<br> asking you to say anything.<br> I am asking... demanding...<br> that you put your signature,<br> your own signature...<br> on a letter of resignation<br> which I have prepared for you.<br> I will not resign.<br> If you will not resign,<br> you will force me to dismiss you.<br> I will not resign...<br> and you will not dismiss me,<br> Miss Mackay.<br> You will not use<br> the excuse of that pathetic...<br> that humorous document<br> to blackmail me!<br> Mr. Lowther,<br> you are a witness to this.<br> Miss Mackay has made totally unsupported<br> accusations against my name and yours.<br> If she has one<br> authentic shred of evidence...<br> just one,<br> let her bring it forth!<br> Otherwise, if one more word of this<br> outrageous calumny reaches my ears, I shall sue!<br> I shall take Miss Mackay<br> to the public courts...<br> and I shall sue the trustees of<br> Marcia Blaine, if they support her.<br> I will not stand quietly by<br> and allow myself to be crucified...<br> by a woman whose fetid frustration<br> has overcome her judgment!<br> If scandal is to your taste,<br> Miss Mackay, I shall give you a feast!<br> - Miss Brodie!<br> - I am a teacher!<br> I am a teacher,<br> first, last, always!<br> Do you imagine<br> that for one instant...<br> I will let that be taken<br> from me without a fight?<br> I have dedicated, sacrificed<br> my life to this profession.<br> And I will not stand by<br> like an inky little slacker...<br> and watch you rob me<br> of it and for what?<br> For what reason?<br> For jealousy!<br> Because I have the gift<br> of claiming girls for my own.<br> It is true I am<br> a strong influence on my girls.<br> I am proud of it!<br> I influence them to be<br> aware of all the possibilities of life...<br> of beauty, honor, courage.<br> I do not, Miss Mackay, influence them<br> to look for slime where it does not exist!<br> I am going.<br> When my class convenes,<br> my pupils will find me composed...<br> and prepared to reveal to them<br> the succession of the Stuarts.<br> And on Sunday, I will go to Cramond<br> to visit Mr. Lowther.<br> We are accustomed,<br> bachelor and spinster...<br> to spend our Sundays together<br> in sailing and walking the beaches...<br> and in the pursuit<br> of music.<br> Mr. Lowther is teaching me<br> to play the mandolin.<br> Good day, Miss Mackay.<br> Uh, Mr. Lowther...<br> I am sure I need not<br> suggest to you that we keep...<br> the details of Miss Brodie's<br> little... tantrum to ourselves.<br> - Yes...<br> - I've no doubt that you, as well as I...<br> - have her interests at heart.<br> - Well, I...<br> Thank you,<br> Mr. Lowther.<br> No doubt you have<br> other duties to attend to.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, Miss Mackay.<br> Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> Jean!<br> Jean, you were heroic!<br> Heroic!<br> Oh, to see you like that,<br> it was really inspiring!<br> If only I could have stood up<br> like that to Mr. Gaunt, if I said...<br> "Look here, Mr. Gaunt. If you have<br> one authentic shred of evidence,just one..."<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Mr. Gaunt called to see me the night before last.<br> He advised me to resign as organist<br> and elder of the church. He spoke plainly.<br> And what did you answer?<br> I resigned.<br> And you allowed this<br> evil-minded man...<br> a man who uses his position<br> as deacon of the Kirk...<br> to receive the slanderous gossip<br> of petty provincials...<br> But Jean,<br> it isn't just gossip.<br> You do not go home<br> on Sunday nights.<br> They had no proof!<br> None whatever.<br> You should have refused<br> point-blank to resign.<br> Can't you see that resignation<br> is tantamount to a confession of guilt.<br> - But I feel guilty.<br> - Well, I do not!<br> Will you not marry me and put an end<br> to all this sneaking about?<br> - Why won't you marry me?<br> - Only yesterday...<br> it was told to my face that you are planning<br> to marry the chemistry teacher.<br> Oh, I... I played golf<br> with Miss Lockhart once.<br> - Twice.<br> - Twice?<br> Beware.<br> Don't trifle with her.<br> She has the means<br> to blow us all up.<br> Now, don't tease me,Jean.<br> Miss Lockhart means nothing to me.<br> You know all I care about is you.<br> All I want is to see you happy and safe.<br> I don't<br> understand you, Jean.<br> You will not marry me,<br> yet you feed me and share my bed.<br> "Share your bed"!<br> Why can't you say you are my lover?<br> I do not want<br> to be your lover...<br> I want<br> to be your husband.<br> I want to go on my honeymoon where my mother<br> and father went on their honeymoon...<br> and come back to Cramond<br> with my bride.<br> That's what I want.<br> And I want to conduct<br> the church choir too.<br> Rumors are flying.<br> Are you out?<br> Hmph! On the contrary,<br> Miss Mackay experienced...<br> the utmost difficulty<br> in persuading me to stay.<br> How I wish I might have heard her plea.<br> The utmost difficulty.<br> You've been painting Jenny.<br> - Yes, that's right.<br> - I am glad, very glad.<br> She's getting more beautiful each year.<br> She quite amazes me.<br> You see it too.<br> You're an artist.<br> You see things other men don't see.<br> You must see it.<br> Jenny's quite<br> a pretty girl.<br> Pretty? No, no.<br> It's much more than that.<br> She has... extraordinary<br> physical instincts...<br> Primitive and free.<br> Primitive?<br> Little Jenny?<br> What are you<br> up to, Jean?<br> I'm only trying to tell you<br> I've always felt that Jenny...<br> could be<br> magnificently elevated...<br> above the ordinary rung<br> of lovers.<br> What are you<br> talking about?<br> It's just that I've<br> always known that one day...<br> you would paint Jenny.<br> Paint Jenny?<br> Jean, I think you're quite aware<br> of what you're doing.<br> You're trying to put that child<br> in my bed in your place.<br> Don't be disgusting!<br> It's only the words that disgust you!<br> You don't boggle at the thought, do you?<br> You'll accept anything,<br> anything but reality!<br> Trying to useJenny and poor old Lowther,<br> making him play house.<br> I do not use Mr. Lowther.<br> It is I who allow myself to be used.<br> I give him every attention.<br> I cook for him.<br> You feed him instead of loving him.<br> Isn't that it?<br> You know nothing about what there is<br> of love between Gordon and me!<br> Oh, my God! All those boring hours<br> in bed with old Lowther...<br> puffing bravely away...<br> Good. That's more like it.<br> That was direct.<br> That's the first actual contact<br> between us in three years.<br> Get out! Get out!<br> Get out of my class! My girls.<br> Little girls, this is Mr. Lloyd,<br> the art master.<br> When you are 14,<br> if he is still at Marcia Blaine...<br> I will then hand you over to him,<br> and you will be fortunate enough...<br> to receive<br> his artistic guidance.<br> - Good-bye, girls.<br> - Good-bye, Mr. Lloyd.<br> See you<br> in three years.<br> Good-bye,<br> Miss Brodie.<br> I also hope<br> I shall see you.<br> For the rest<br> of the afternoon...<br> I have decided we will<br> not do more history.<br> Rather, I will show you some more slides...<br> of my last holidays<br> in Italy.<br> Monitors,<br> the blinds, please.<br> Clara, will you<br> pull down the screen?<br> I also spent<br> two weeks in Egypt...<br> where people do not believe<br> in God, but in Allah.<br> Kathryn, will you<br> switch on the light, please?<br> The bottom,<br> left-hand side.<br> I have brought you these slides<br> at my own expense.<br> The girls at the back<br> may sit up on their desks.<br> Rome.<br> This is a large formation<br> of II Duce's fascisti.<br> They are following him<br> in noble destiny.<br> I, myself,<br> mingled with such a crowd.<br> I wore my silk dress<br> with red poppies...<br> which is right<br> for my coloring.<br> Benito Mussolini.<br> II Duce.<br> Italy's leader supreme.<br> A Roman worthy of his heritage.<br> The greatest Roman of them all.<br> The Colosseum...<br> where Christian slaves<br> were thrown to the lions...<br> and gladiators<br> fought to the death.<br> "Hail, Caesar.<br> Those who are about to die salute thee".<br> Florence.<br> The David<br> of Michelangelo.<br> That is<br> the original David.<br> He's in the Galleria<br> dell'Accademia di Belle Arti.<br> There's a copy<br> in the Piazza della Signoria...<br> next to<br> the Palazzo Vecchio.<br> He's there for any passer-by<br> to gaze upon and be uplifted.<br> He's at once the glory of the past<br> and the inspiration of the future.<br> David,<br> the young warrior.<br> This is a picture<br> of the Ponte Vecchio...<br> "The old bridge"<br> Ponte Vecchio.<br> There's a famous painting<br> of Dante meeting Beatrice...<br> It is pronounced<br> "Beatrichi" in Italian...<br> which makes it<br> very beautiful...<br> Meeting Beatrice<br> on the Ponte Vecchio.<br> He fell in love with her<br> at that moment.<br> He was a man in his middle years.<br> She was 14. That can happen.<br> A mature man can find love<br> in a young girl, a very young girl.<br> Find the spring...<br> the essence<br> of all old loves.<br> It is not unlikely that<br> we shall never know...<br> that Beatrice<br> reminded Dante sharply...<br> in that moment<br> when he first saw her...<br> on the Ponte Vecchio...<br> of an old love...<br> a lost love,<br> a sublime love...<br> and he was seized<br> with such a longing...<br> such longing...<br> That picture<br> was painted by Rossetti.<br> Who was<br> Dante Gabriel Rossetti?<br> Jenny, who was<br> Dante Gabriel Rossetti?<br> Clara.<br> A painter, Miss Brodie.<br> What... What was that you said?<br> A painter.<br> Yes. Yes, a painter.<br> Oh, yes.<br> A paint...<br> A painter.<br> Where you're mistaken is in supposing<br> that Jean Brodie is unique.<br> There's an army of these ladies<br> in Edinburgh.<br> It's simply that they do not<br> attempt to teach in schools...<br> of the traditional character<br> of Marcia Blaine.<br> She is<br> a magnificent specimen.<br> She's utterly<br> ridiculous.<br> There's no contradiction in being<br> both ridiculous and magnificent.<br> Your young mind will have to<br> stretch a bit to grasp that.<br> I think my young mind<br> is stretched astonishingly...<br> to be able to discuss<br> at 17... at 17...<br> the enduring passion<br> of my lover for another woman.<br> It is not only<br> astonishing, Sandy...<br> it is unnatural.<br> You should be passionate...<br> and involved...<br> and shortsighted.<br> - I'm tired.<br> - Take a rest, then.<br> I'll make some tea.<br> Her and her passions,<br> her fascisti.<br> You should see her skulking around<br> the third formers, trying to raise funds for Franco.<br> Franco? Oh, my God.<br> Oh, yes.<br> We've gone very Spanish this term...<br> what with Mary McGregor's<br> brother and all.<br> What's Mary McGregor's<br> miserable brother got to do with Franco?<br> Haven't you heard?<br> He's run off to Spain to fight.<br> Miss Brodie's<br> beside herself with joy.<br> Jean knows nothing of politics<br> or politicians.<br> She simply invests all leaders<br> with her own romantic vision.<br> Why isn't there ever<br> anything to eat in this place?<br> You know, it occurred to me<br> that the Brodie set...<br> has been Miss Brodie's faithful fascisti,<br> marching along...<br> and I suddenly thought<br> of her disapproval of the Girl Guides.<br> Why, it's simply jealousy.<br> The Guides are a rival fascisti...<br> and she<br> cannot bear it.<br> How I wish<br> I'd joined the Brownies.<br> What a spiteful<br> child it is.<br> You're too irritable<br> for a girl of your age.<br> My age does bother you,<br> doesn't it?<br> How much longer are you going to be<br> tempted by this firm, young flesh?<br> Until you're 18<br> and over the hill.<br> Hey, Teddy,<br> take me dancing.<br> - Certainly not.<br> - What a coward.<br> A man with a wife and six children<br> plus a schoolgirl for a mistress...<br> can be called any number of rude names,<br> but "coward" is not one of them.<br> So sweet,<br> the flesh of the neck.<br> If only it could be<br> bottled and sold across the counter.<br> I really shouldn't feed<br> your depraved appetite.<br> Hey, Teddy. Teddy, listen.<br> When can I look at my painting?<br> I'm very bored with not being allowed<br> to see my own portrait.<br> When I've finished it,<br> and I shall never finish it.<br> We shall go on like this<br> until one or both of us is dead.<br> Now. I want to see myself<br> mirrored in your eyes.<br> - I need a vision of myself.<br> - No, Sandy. No.<br> I haven't<br> finished it yet.<br> - I'm not pleased with it yet.<br> - Oh, you.<br> You'll never<br> be pleased.<br> Sandy!<br> I cannot<br> help myself, Sandy.<br> Believe me, it has nothing to do<br> with what I feel for you.<br> Even the skin tones<br> are hers.<br> It's not even my skin.<br> And I thought...<br> I really thought that you...<br> Well, you know,<br> desired me.<br> Desired me.<br> I... I do.<br> It might just as well<br> have been Jenny after all.<br> It would have been<br> the same with anyone.<br> Sandy,<br> listen to me.<br> Love is the most irrational thing<br> on God's Earth.<br> Do you think I choose<br> to love Jean Brodie?<br> If I could choose,<br> I would love my wife or you.<br> You are the most<br> remarkable girl I've ever known.<br> You are marvelous<br> and astonishing and desirable.<br> Why would I not choose to love you,<br> if I could choose?<br> Please don't think less<br> of yourself because I am...<br> bewitched.<br> Very well.<br> I shan't.<br> - Believe what I'm telling you.<br> - Oh, I believe you, Teddy.<br> I even believe that<br> you are bewitched.<br> I'm not sure about God, but I am now<br> quite sure about witches.<br> Will you be back<br> tomorrow?<br> No, I won't be back.<br> That really would be<br> a waste of time, wouldn't it?<br> Good night, Teddy.<br> You can<br> go on painting.<br> You don't really<br> need a model.<br> As this seems to be<br> a time for truth...<br> you're quite<br> a mediocre painter, Teddy.<br> You'll never be<br> really good.<br> I wonder you don't try<br> some other line.<br> You are getting on,<br> you know.<br> Generalissimo Franco<br> is called El Jefe, the chief.<br> J-E-F-E.<br> The "J" is silent. El Jefe.<br> He is<br> a dedicated man.<br> You must all grow up<br> to be dedicated women...<br> as generalissimo Franco has<br> dedicated himself to a cause...<br> as I have dedicated<br> myself to you.<br> Dedication is<br> the order of the day.<br> Oh, Mary McGregor, girls,<br> come and join us.<br> Mary, dear, is there any news<br> from your brother from Spain?<br> No, Miss Brodie.<br> Nothing.<br> Mr. Ealing at the b-bank<br> is sending for him...<br> sending d-d-detectives<br> to Spain.<br> Your brother<br> is being sent for?<br> Mr. Ealing at the bank<br> would send for Caesar.<br> The Mr. Ealings at the bank<br> have tried throughout history...<br> to stay the march<br> of civilization.<br> Why can't they understand? It should<br> be obvious to the meanest intelligence.<br> Franco's army comprises the best<br> elements of Spain and her supporters.<br> They are committed<br> to heroic action.<br> You little girls are living<br> in a time that will demand...<br> all that you have to give<br> of courage and gallantry.<br> You must become heroines.<br> Heroines!<br> Do you mean we will have to<br> march and shoot guns?<br> If you are called.<br> Girls?<br> Have you never heard<br> of Hannah Snell?<br> She was an English girl born in 1723<br> and sailed in Admiral Boscawen's fleet.<br> And fought at Araapong.<br> She was wounded.<br> But without medical aid, she extracted<br> the bullet from her own shoulder...<br> and lived<br> to serve again.<br> Hannah Snell was a girl.<br> - Ooh!<br> - Now, you, too, must be prepared...<br> to serve, suffer<br> and sacrifice.<br> - Are you prepared?<br> - Yes, Miss Brodie.<br> Yes, Miss Brodie.<br> No, Miss Brodie.<br> But she could<br> get shot.<br> Without medical aid, she would extract<br> the bullet from her own shoulder...<br> and live<br> to serve again.<br> It isn't funny.<br> She could really get hurt.<br> - What's going on? Who could get hurt?<br> - Mary McGregor.<br> She's run away to Spain<br> to fight.<br> - What kind of joke is this?<br> - It isn't a joke.<br> She's really gone<br> to Spain.<br> Mary McGregor couldn't negotiate<br> her way across Edinburgh.<br> - Ah, but she has a guiding spirit.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> I'm sure Miss Brodie gave Mary<br> very explicit directions.<br> The Paris train will take you<br> as far as Perpignan.<br> P-E-R-P-I-G-N-A-N.<br> Now, the pounds are<br> in this envelope marked "pounds".<br> And the francs are<br> in this envelope marked "rancs".<br> And the pesetas are<br> in this envelope marked "pesetas".<br> How else?<br> - I don't believe it.<br> - Nor do I.<br> Miss Brodie<br> will be frantic.<br> Miss Brodie<br> will be ecstatic.<br> Moving your troops<br> to Barcelona?<br> Mary McGregor has gone<br> to join her brother.<br> He is her only kin.<br> Yes, I heard you've been<br> raising funds for Franco.<br> I find that<br> extraordinary.<br> The times<br> are extraordinary.<br> Miss Brodie!<br> Miss Brodie.!<br> Oh!<br> Oh, Mary McGregor.<br> Girls, I have<br> called you together...<br> my special girls...<br> to tell you the truth<br> about Mary McGregor.<br> Miss Mackay has told you<br> the facts about Mary's death...<br> how the train was bombed and machine-gunned<br> as it crossed the frontier...<br> but only I<br> can tell you the truth.<br> Mary McGregor<br> died a heroine.<br> It was her intention<br> to fight for Franco...<br> against the forces of darkness.<br> So although she was killed before<br> she herself could strike a blow...<br> her intention<br> was a noble and heroic one.<br> Had she lived...<br> Mary would have become a woman<br> of great spirit and initiative.<br> Hers would have been<br> a dedicated life.<br> You must all grow up<br> to be dedicated women...<br> as Mary McGregor dedicated<br> her youth to a cause...<br> as I have dedicated<br> myself to you.<br> Tonight, little girls...<br> let your imaginations soar.<br> Think of Joan of Arc...<br> Florence Nightingale.<br> Think of Mary McGregor.<br> Who among you has<br> the makings of a heroine?<br> Yes, Clara?<br> May we think of you,<br> Miss Brodie?<br> Well, why not?<br> Deep in most of us<br> is a potential for greatness...<br> or the potential<br> to inspire greatness.<br> The day draws late.<br> Your families will be expecting you.<br> Take home the story<br> of Mary McGregor.<br> Sandy?<br> I thought you and I<br> might have tea together.<br> I wanted<br> to talk to you about Mary.<br> I'm sorry,<br> but I have some work to do.<br> How busy and grown-up you've become.<br> Well, I won't try to stop you, but you must<br> remember how much I do depend on you.<br> I'll remember.<br> Somebody's crying<br> Do you wonder who<br> Tears that would fill up<br> An ocean or two<br> He's too unhappy<br> to even feel blue<br> Somebody's crying for you<br> Somebody's crying<br> Pay him no mind<br> He's just a someone<br> That you left behind<br> Although it could be<br> And you'll never see<br> That somebody<br> crying is me<br> Yesterday's lover<br> Like yesterday's dream<br> Lost like a flower<br> That floats<br> down the stream<br> - Mr. Lloyd?<br> - Yes, I should think so.<br> @ Only the sorrow<br> @ Somebody's crying<br> for you<br> - Would you like to dance, Sandy?<br> - No, thank you.<br> I thought it was considered<br> a triumph of the first magnitude...<br> to be asked to dance<br> by a male staff member.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Mr. Lloyd said I could have my portrait done.<br> - Monica.<br> - Oh, thank you, Sandy.<br> - All right.<br> Somebody's crying<br> Do you wonder who<br> Tears that would<br> fill up<br> An ocean or two<br> You know how I feel<br> For sadly, but true<br> That somebody crying is you<br> Would you like<br> some punch, Miss Brodie?<br> Oh, Mr. Lloyd.<br> Thank you.<br> That's very<br> thoughtful of you.<br> Well,Jean,<br> how's the Franco fund coming along?<br> Mm! Not well.<br> Popular sentiment being what it is...<br> one can hardly plead the cause<br> in the Marcia Blaine assembly hall.<br> Yes, I dare say. I, too, am attempting<br> to raise funds for a worthy cause.<br> You? What sort of cause?<br> A romantic one. I am taking up<br> a collection to buy a wedding present...<br> for Lowther<br> and Miss Lockhart.<br> May I put you down<br> for a pound?<br> It's to be a simple affair in Cramond Kirk<br> a week on Saturday.<br> I'm told when they announced<br> their intention to Miss Mackay last evening...<br> her delight was so profound that she ran amok<br> and toasted them in neat whiskey.<br> - Ah, Miss Brodie.<br> - Oh, good evening, Mr. Burrage, girls.<br> - Good evening, Miss Brodie.<br> - I've not seen you dancing yet.<br> Oh, the night<br> is young, Mr. Burrage.<br> Excuse me<br> for one moment.<br> Teddy... Teddy, who told you<br> to come to me like that?<br> I volunteered. "I", said the sparrow,<br> "with my bow and arrow".<br> - I volunteered.<br> - And what kill, pray, did you expect to make?<br> Do you think I cannot,<br> with one snap of my fingers...<br> send poor Miss Lockhart<br> back to her gaseous domain?<br> It was I who<br> encouraged Mr. Lowther...<br> in his reluctant<br> pursuit of Miss Lockhart.<br> What I cannot understand is you.<br> I cannot understand you.<br> Malice.<br> Coming to me that way...<br> hoping to hurt<br> and humiliate me, why?<br> I don't know.<br> It's what I wanted, to hurt you.<br> Why? Why are you<br> so angry with me?<br> Because I'm afraid.<br> Because I don't feel safe with you around.<br> You should have married old Lowther,<br> you really should.<br> I'm 43 years old, ean.<br> How old are you?<br> - I'm f... I'm in my prime.<br> - Your prime!<br> Look at yourself,Jean.<br> Look at me...<br> a second-rate painter running to seed.<br> - You're not in your prime,Jean.<br> - Teddy, don't...<br> You're a frustrated spinster taking it out<br> in idiot causes and dangerous ideas.<br> - A schoolmarm.<br> - I am a teacher.<br> A teacher or a leader?<br> The dangerous Miss Brodie<br> and her troops.<br> Well, where you lead<br> I cannot follow.<br> Arrivederci.<br> - Mr. Burrage, will you dance?<br> - Yes. Yes. Delighted.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Miss Mackay...<br> since you were first appointed<br> headmistress of Marcia Blaine...<br> you have done nothing but try<br> to dismiss me from the teaching staff.<br> You have tried<br> every feeble excuse...<br> even that of immorality,<br> and failed.<br> Now you are accusing me<br> of preaching politics to my pupils.<br> Such a continuous<br> personal vendetta...<br> is hardly conducive<br> to the dignity of your position.<br> Miss Brodie, I don't think<br> you quite understand.<br> Let me make the situation<br> perfectly clear.<br> It is not I,<br> but the board of governors...<br> who have pursued this investigation<br> to its conclusion.<br> And it is<br> the board of governors who...<br> after having given due consideration<br> to the grave charges laid against you...<br> have given instructions that you leave<br> this school immediately...<br> and that your classes be taken over<br> tomorrow morning by another teacher.<br> The board have asked me<br> to convey to you the fact that...<br> your salary will be paid in full<br> until the end of the term...<br> which, in the circumstances,<br> is more than generous.<br> Miss Brodie,<br> there is nothing more to be said.<br> I shall not accept<br> the board's action.<br> I shall petition. I shall put<br> the question before the public...<br> before the parents<br> and the student body.<br> You will find, Miss Mackay,<br> that I have the loyalty of my girls.<br> Do you, Miss Brodie?<br> For they are jolly good fellows<br> Which nobody can deny.<br> Come, now, Lowther, give us a song.!<br> Why, Miss Brodie,<br> aren't you coming to the common room?<br> - Common room?<br> - The celebration honoring Miss Lockhart and Mr. Lowther.<br> My love is like<br> a red, red rose<br> Aren't you coming,<br> Miss Brodie?<br> I'll...<br> I'll be there shortly.<br> In June<br> Oh, my love<br> is like a melody<br> That's sweetly<br> played in tune<br> As fair art thou<br> my bonny lass<br> So deep in love am I<br> And I will love<br> thee still, my dear<br> Sandy.<br> Sandy.<br> I believe, Sandy...<br> I believe<br> I am past my prime.<br> I had reckoned<br> on my prime lasting...<br> till I was<br> at least... 50.<br> Are you listening,<br> Sandy?<br> I'm listening,<br> Miss Brodie.<br> I have been dismissed<br> from Marcia Blaine.<br> I am accused of teaching<br> treason and sedition to my students.<br> I am being transported<br> for radicalism...<br> like Thomas Muir<br> of Huntershill.<br> But if Miss Mackay<br> and her conspirators...<br> expect that I shall meekly lay my head<br> on their chopping block...<br> - they're in for a wee surprise.<br> - What will you do?<br> As I informed Miss Mackay,<br> I will resort to public petition.<br> I have no doubt that many supporters<br> will rally to my defense.<br> My students are loyal.<br> My girls.<br> Someone betrayed me, Sandy.<br> Someone spoke against me to the board.<br> Who could it<br> have been? Who?<br> Are you thinking that<br> maybe one of your girls betrayed you?<br> I said<br> to Miss Mackay...<br> "I have the loyalty<br> of my girls,<br> and she said,<br> "Do you?"<br> I'll not believe it. I'll not believe<br> it was one of my girls.<br> Perhaps it's true.<br> I thought possibly Monica.<br> There's very little soul...<br> - Monica is a loyal girl.<br> - I know. You all are.<br> Monica and Jenny.<br> Oh, notJenny.<br> She's like<br> a part of myself.<br> You, Sandy... As you see,<br> you are exempt from all suspicion.<br> You have had more<br> of my confidence than anyone.<br> You know more than anyone<br> what I have sacrificed for my girls.<br> Teddy Lloyd was greatly<br> in love with me, Sandy...<br> as I think<br> you've always known.<br> And I gave him up to consecrate<br> my life to the young girls in my care...<br> you and Monica<br> and Jenny.<br> Jenny...<br> She and Mr. Lloyd<br> will soon be lovers.<br> - I have that.<br> - Do you think that you are Providence?<br> That you can ordain love?<br> What?<br> You haven't<br> pulled it off.<br> Jenny will not be<br> Teddy Lloyd's lover.<br> What are you saying,<br> Sandy?<br> Jenny will not be<br> Teddy Lloyd's lover...<br> and I'll not be your spy,<br> your secret service.<br> My spy? What on earth<br> are you talking about?<br> Do you understand at all<br> what has happened to me?<br> I have been dismissed<br> from Marcia Blaine!<br> Why are you standing there talking<br> about Providence and the secret service?<br> What is the matter<br> with you?<br> Miss Brodie,<br> I am Teddy's lover.<br> What?<br> I am Teddy's lover.<br> Teddy's lover? You?<br> Is that so difficult<br> to believe?<br> What does it matter to you which one of us it is?<br> It doesn't matter to Teddy.<br> Whatever possessed you?<br> You know his religion.<br> How could a girl<br> with a mind of her own...<br> have to do with a man<br> who can't think for himself?<br> That doesn't seem<br> to have bothered either of us, does it?<br> We were neither of us<br> very interested in his mind.<br> How dare you speak to me<br> in this manner!<br> I suppose I've always known that one day<br> you were going to ask how dare I?<br> Why? I don't understand.<br> I don't seem to understand<br> what has happened to everyone.<br> Where has everyone gone?<br> Only Mary is gone.<br> Mary? What has Mary<br> to do with it?<br> Miss Brodie,<br> Mary McGregor is dead!<br> Are you aware of<br> the order of importance...<br> in which you place<br> your anxieties?<br> One, you have<br> been betrayed.<br> Two, who is or is not to be your proxy<br> in Teddy Lloyd's bed...<br> and three, Mary's death.<br> Miss Brodie, aren't you concerned<br> at all with Mary's death?<br> I grieve for Mary.<br> It was because of you<br> she went!<br> Because of me?<br> It was her brother.<br> The poor, unfortunate girl<br> hadn't anyone else in the world.<br> She had you.<br> That was her misfortune.<br> To please you, that silly, stupid girl<br> ran off and got herself killed!<br> Don't you feel<br> responsible for that?<br> No.<br> No, I feel responsible<br> for giving her ideals...<br> The ideals that<br> sent her to Spain.<br> I feel responsible for teaching her<br> that service to a cause is a privilege.<br> You call it a privilege<br> to be killed?<br> And for nothing.<br> Nothing!<br> You really are<br> a shallow girl, Sandy.<br> By the way she died,<br> Mary McGregor illumined her life.<br> - She died a heroine.<br> - She died a fool!<br> Joining her brother to fight for Franco...<br> wasn't that just like Mary?<br> Her brother is fighting<br> for the other side.<br> - Her brother...<br> - Her brother is fighting for the Republicans!<br> Mary was headed<br> for the wrong army!<br> Oh, Mary McGregor!<br> "Mary McGregor".<br> I used to wonder why<br> you always called Mary by her full name.<br> I think it was because you had<br> such a hard time remembering who she was.<br> Poor, dim Mary.<br> I was devoted to Mary.<br> No, you were only attracted to Mary<br> because she had no one else...<br> and she was<br> so totally suggestible.<br> She appealed<br> to your vanity!<br> It was you<br> who betrayed me.<br> I didn't betray you!<br> I simply<br> put a stop to you!<br> Oh, I see.<br> No, you don't see.<br> You don't see that<br> you're not good for people.<br> In what way?<br> In what way, Sandy,<br> was I not good for you?<br> You are dangerous<br> and unwholesome...<br> and children should not<br> be exposed to you!<br> How can you think it?<br> How can you think<br> that I would harm you?<br> - But you have... You have harmed me!<br> - How?<br> You have murdered Mary!<br> You have<br> assassinated me!<br> Oh, why must you<br> always strike attitudes?<br> You really are<br> a ridiculous woman!<br> What will you do... now?<br> Do?<br> I don't know.<br> But I am a descendant,<br> do not forget...<br> of Willie Brodie.<br> He was a man<br> of substance...<br> A cabinetmaker<br> and a designer of gibbets...<br> a member of the town council<br> of Edinburgh...<br> the keeper of two mistresses<br> who bore him five children between them.<br> Blood tells.<br> He played much dice and fighting cocks.<br> Eventually, he was a wanted man<br> for having robbed the excise office.<br> Not that he needed<br> the money.<br> He was a burglar<br> for the sake of the danger.<br> He died cheerfully<br> on a gibbet of his own devising in 1788.<br> That is the stuff<br> I am made of.<br> I knew you would rise<br> like a phoenix.<br> I'm glad I shall not<br> have to worry about you.<br> No, I expect that<br> is to be your gift, Sandy...<br> to kill without concern.<br> It is you<br> who are dangerous.<br> You see yourself as a conqueror,<br> don't you, Sandy?<br> Kaiserian in all<br> his beauty rare.<br> But you profess to be<br> a great admirer of conquerors.<br> Good-bye, Miss Brodie.<br> Assassin!<br> Assassin!<br> Lord, dismiss us<br> with Thy blessing<br> Thanks for mercies<br> past receive<br> Pardon all<br> their faults confessing<br> Time that's lost<br> may all retrieve<br> May thy children<br> May thy children<br> Never again<br> Thy spirit grieve<br> Today we say good-bye<br> to those senior girls...<br> who are leaving<br> Marcia Blaine for the last time.<br> You girls are about<br> to take your place...<br> in a larger,<br> more demanding world.<br> In this world, you will be called upon<br> to make many moral decisions...<br> affecting not only<br> your own lives...<br> but the lives of your families,<br> your friends,your acquaintances.<br> We are confident,<br> truly confident...<br> that the training you have received<br> here in this school...<br> will have equipped you to face life's quandaries<br> with courage and character.<br> For here at Marcia Blaine...<br> we have done our best<br> to nurture the virtuous woman...<br> for her price<br> is far above rubies.<br> Let us pray.<br> Little girls...<br> I am in the business<br> of putting old heads on young shoulders...<br> and all my pupils<br> are the crme de la crme.<br> Give me a girl<br> at an impressionable age...<br> and she is mine for life.<br> Vtg<br>
