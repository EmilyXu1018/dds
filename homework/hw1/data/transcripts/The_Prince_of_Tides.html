                        I grew up slowly, beside the tides<br> and marshes...<br> ... of a Carolina sea island.<br> We lived in a small, white house...<br> ... won by my<br> great-great-grandfather...<br> ... Winston Shadrach Wingo...<br> ... in a horseshoe game.<br> Last one around the tree is a ninny!<br> Joop, Joop! Come here.<br> Boys, boys! Careful, now.<br> - I'll race you, Tom.<br> - Wait up, Luke.<br> There are families<br> who live their entire lives...<br> ... without a single thing of interest<br> happening to them.<br> Don't run so fast, Tom!<br> I've always envied those families.<br> Luke, mind you,<br> don't torment that dog.<br> It's my dog!<br> Tom, you're gonna step on him.<br> He's only a pup!<br> Here, Joop. Come here!<br> Mom, did you see me run?<br> Savannah, you want a bean?<br> Boys, you want a bean?<br> Quit squealing, Savannah.<br> You're next, Tom.<br> The child of a beautiful woman,<br> I was also a shrimper's son...<br> ... in love with the shape of boats.<br> Luke, he's pushing me.<br> I'm not pushing her!<br> As a small boy, I loved to navigate<br> my father's shrimp boat...<br> ... between the sandbars.<br> I suppose Henry Wingo would have<br> made a pretty good father...<br> ... if he hadn't been<br> such a violent man.<br> From my mother, I inherited<br> a love of language...<br> ... and an appreciation of nature.<br> She could turn a walk<br> around the island...<br> ... into a voyage of purest discovery.<br> As a child, I thought she was<br> the most extraordinary woman on earth.<br> I wasn't the first son to be wrong<br> about his mother.<br> I am sick and tired...<br> ...of you never showing me<br> any respect in my own house.<br> I don't know when my parents began<br> their war against each other.<br> But I do know the only prisoners they<br> took were their children.<br> Wait, you guys.<br> My shoes are falling off!<br> Keep up, Savannah.<br> When my brother, sister and I needed<br> to escape, we developed a ritual.<br> We found a silent, soothing world<br> where there was no pain.<br> A world without mothers or fathers.<br> We would make a circle<br> bound by flesh...<br> ... and blood...<br> ... and water.<br> And only when we felt our lungs betray<br> us, would we rise toward the light...<br> ... and the fear of what lay in wait<br> for us above the surface.<br> All this was a long time ago...<br> ... before I chose not<br> to have a memory.<br> Daddy!<br> I think something bit me!<br> Mr. Brighton, are you selling dope<br> to my girls again?<br> Stop bugging us, Dad.<br> - Bye, Mr. Brighton.<br> - Come on in. It's getting late!<br> It's a conch.<br> Bring him home.<br> I'll send him to college!<br> How do you know it's a boy?<br> Well, let's examine him.<br> Girls, have I ever told you<br> the facts of life?<br> Oh, no. Not this again.<br> Stay away from boys because<br> they're disgusting beasts...<br> ...that pee on bushes<br> and pick their noses.<br> - Gross, Dad!<br> - That's completely gross.<br> Anyway, I'm not gonna stay<br> away from boys.<br> That's the spirit. Never do<br> what parents tell you.<br> Hey, Mom, look what I found!<br> If you don't quit smoking, you'll die.<br> That's what they told me at school.<br> Well, no more school for you.<br> Mom, Dad's smoking again.<br> Oh, no. Well, you know what to do<br> with that. Put it in the sink.<br> Give me a kiss.<br> I wanna play.<br> You look tired, doctor.<br> I'll fix you a drink.<br> That would be so nice.<br> It's been one of those days.<br> Hey, honey, it's tough work<br> being a saint.<br> Sal, can you get it?<br> Something smells good.<br> - Hey, Dad. Come and play with us.<br> - Later.<br> - Your mother, from her car.<br> - I'm not here.<br> Okay, Lila. She's coming over.<br> Why didn't you tell her we were<br> under quarantine?<br> She said she had to see you.<br> - Dad, they won't share.<br> - Work it out, girls.<br> She said it was urgent.<br> She was crying.<br> I can't remember a day<br> when Lila wasn't crying.<br> Be nice to her, Tom.<br> I hate my mother, Sally.<br> I enjoy hating her.<br> Don't kill one of the few<br> pleasures in my life.<br> Can we talk about<br> something else?<br> - Sure, what?<br> - Us.<br> I need a stiff drink<br> for that conversation.<br> Girls?<br> - Girls!<br> - What?<br> - Anyone want to sit on Daddy's lap?<br> - No!<br> - There's money involved.<br> - Okay!<br> I'm gonna ask you<br> a serious question.<br> - I want you to answer honestly.<br> - I know the question.<br> Who's the greatest human being<br> on this earth?<br> Mama? I've gotta develop<br> some new routines.<br> Come on, everybody. Pick up, now.<br> Come on, wash. It's bath time.<br> Gotta pass inspection.<br> Lila's coming over.<br> Lila, Lila, Lila.<br> Why can't we call her Grandma?<br> - You'll know when you're a grandma.<br> - I will?<br> Pick up and get into that tub.<br> How does bouillabaisse<br> sound to you?<br> Yuck! Can't we ever have normal food?<br> Do you think we could talk seriously?<br> Not now, Sally.<br> My mother's close.<br> Can't you tell?<br> The air stopped moving.<br> Sometimes I think what you need is<br> a good smack across your mouth.<br> Here she is. Sally, tie<br> this garlic around my neck.<br> Do we have to invite her for dinner?<br> She won't stay. You know that.<br> Then let's invite her.<br> Lila.<br> Hello, Sally, dear.<br> Those shrubs need watering.<br> Yeah. I have to do that.<br> - You're looking well, Lila.<br> - Don't be glib, Tom.<br> - Will you have dinner with us?<br> - No. I can't stay long.<br> What a shame.<br> - Where are the children?<br> - They're taking baths. Why?<br> I have some bad news.<br> They cancelled<br> your American Express card?<br> Your sister tried to<br> kill herself again.<br> You wanna make another joke?<br> - Oh, my God, Lila. When?<br> - I'm not sure.<br> She was in a coma when they found her.<br> How is she now?<br> She's alive, thank God.<br> I spoke to her psychiatrist.<br> Some Jewish woman in New York.<br> She wants one of us to go up there<br> now. I told her you'd go.<br> If she's a shrink and a Jew,<br> you can't go?<br> I didn't say that. I'm just not<br> entirely sure I'd be welcome.<br> Savannah will probably blame me.<br> My children blame me for everything.<br> Do I detect a note<br> of guilt, Mama?<br> Don't give me that<br> psychological horseshit.<br> Why don't you just say it? I'm<br> responsible for all your problems...<br> ...including you not having a job.<br> Let's hit way below the belt!<br> Don't pretend you didn't start this.<br> I just can't go right now. It's your<br> stepfather's birthday this weekend.<br> I can't go either. I gotta<br> wash out Sally's pantyhose.<br> I'm going to the cleaners.<br> Why don't you get a job<br> as a standup comedian?<br> It pays better than teaching did.<br> Which was far beneath me. Right?<br> Beneath your abilities, yes.<br> What do you know about my<br> abilities, for chrissake?<br> Just stop it, now, the both of you!<br> I'm sorry you're hurting.<br> You wanted to talk?<br> It can wait.<br> Let's walk.<br> Tell me what you're thinking.<br> I'm trying to calculate the exact<br> moment everything got so fucked up.<br> I'm also worried the Braves<br> are gonna finish last.<br> I don't feel like laughing.<br> Oh, come on, Sally. Come on.<br> Do you know that this is the first<br> time you have touched me in weeks?<br> My life's a mess, Sally.<br> Our life's a mess, Tom.<br> Look, there's the Big Dipper.<br> I don't give a shit about<br> the Big Dipper!<br> Damn it, I care about us.<br> I care about why you keep<br> pushing me away.<br> I thought you said this could wait.<br> I've been waiting for two<br> years, Tom. Ever since Luke died.<br> I know how you feel about him.<br> I just don't know how you feel<br> about me anymore.<br> Don't take it personally. I don't<br> know how I feel about anything anymore.<br> God, you're pathetic.<br> Don't blame it on us.<br> Blame it on Con Ed!<br> Get this truck out of here.<br> Come on, I'm in a hurry!<br> I've got a doctor's appointment.<br> Hey, lady! What are you<br> honking at me for?<br> It was only my sister who could force<br> me to come to this God-awful city.<br> This city that roars down on you.<br> She loved it all.<br> The muggers, the winos...<br> ... the bag ladies,<br> the wall-to-wall noise.<br> She loved it because it had nothing<br> to do with our childhood.<br> Luke and I hated it for<br> exactly the same reason.<br> You're...<br> Hello.<br> I'm Dr. Lowenstein.<br> You must be Tom.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Why don't you come in?<br> You can leave your things there.<br> Am I supposed to lie down on the couch,<br> or are we gonna make polite chitchat?<br> How about a cup of coffee?<br> Oh, we're gonna make<br> polite chitchat first.<br> Was that yes or no to the coffee?<br> It's a yes, ma'am.<br> Cream and sugar?<br> And you don't have to call me ma'am.<br> That's my good home-training,<br> and I'm a little nervous.<br> Cream, no sugar.<br> Why do you think you're nervous?<br> I get nervous every time my sister<br> tries to kill herself. It's a quirk.<br> A quirk?<br> I'm sorry. I was being cynical.<br> It's a family trait.<br> Oh, I don't think Savannah's cynical.<br> No? She's suicidal.<br> I wish she was cynical.<br> How is my sister?<br> She's out of physical danger, but...<br> When can I see her?<br> You have to wait until tomorrow.<br> Why can't I go now?<br> She's very agitated today.<br> We're trying to quiet her down.<br> I think it would be too upsetting.<br> Wouldn't upset me.<br> No, but it might upset her.<br> How's your coffee?<br> Is it hot enough?<br> It'll do.<br> In Savannah's poems...<br> ...are you the shrimper or the coach?<br> The coach.<br> Luke's the shrimper, or was.<br> Savannah's last suicide attempt<br> was right after his death, correct?<br> Yeah, she had a few bad days over it.<br> Were there other times?<br> I don't know.<br> There might have been another time<br> when we were young, but I'm not sure.<br> How are you getting paid?<br> Why change the subject?<br> Because I don't like it much.<br> Is it okay if I smoke?<br> I'd prefer it if you didn't.<br> How well do you know<br> your sister's poetry?<br> I said I was a coach, Lowenstein,<br> not an orangutan.<br> I was also an English teacher.<br> I know her poetry. She's my twin.<br> I know it a hell of a lot better<br> than you do.<br> You don't like<br> psychiatrists, do you?<br> What good do you people do?<br> You ask a lot of questions.<br> I'm sick of this whole damn routine.<br> I'm sick of my sister's<br> attraction to razorblades.<br> And I'm sick of shrinks who can't<br> do a fucking thing to help her.<br> I don't know if I can<br> help her either.<br> But I do know I'm not<br> gonna give up trying.<br> Why not? Maybe she just wants<br> to die too damn much.<br> And that's okay?<br> You sound resigned to losing her.<br> Hell no, it's not okay with me.<br> Yeah, but I am resigned.<br> Then I don't think you can<br> help me with Savannah.<br> I'm sorry you had<br> to come all this way.<br> What do you want from me?<br> Information.<br> You see, I've only been Savannah's<br> doctor for a few months.<br> There's so much more<br> I need to know about her.<br> I need her childhood stories,<br> and she can't tell me...<br> ...because she's blocked portions of<br> her life out. Blotted out.<br> So I need you to be her memory,<br> in a sense...<br> ...and fill in the missing details.<br> I've spent my life trying<br> to forget those missing details.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - I...<br> God, she's a pain in the ass.<br> What time tomorrow?<br> I'll meet you at the hospital at noon.<br> Do you have a headache?<br> A doozy. You wouldn't have any<br> morphine handy, would you?<br> Morphine?<br> That's a joke, Lowenstein.<br> Come on, get out of the way, kid.<br> You're gonna get hurt.<br> Screw you, man.<br> You gonna help me with the bags?<br> You out of your mind?<br> I ain't helping you with no bags.<br> Come on, move!<br> Get out of the way, huh?<br> Yo, taxi!<br> Shit! Shit!<br> Move your ass an inch...<br> ...and you can kiss it goodbye.<br> Hi, Eddie. Go ahead and shoot,<br> I've had a rotten day.<br> Tom! You should have told me<br> you were coming.<br> The gun, Eddie, the gun.<br> I'm sorry. Savannah and I have<br> been robbed twice this year.<br> They're leaping from fire escapes.<br> One landed on my air conditioner.<br> I greased my windowsills.<br> That didn't help.<br> I love New York.<br> Tell me about it.<br> - How's Andrew?<br> - Gone.<br> Said he needed space, so he found<br> a younger man with a duplex.<br> It's his loss, Eddie.<br> Bless you.<br> Savannah was an angel.<br> I practically lived over here.<br> So you're alone now, huh?<br> Unless I can tempt you into<br> crossing the line while you're here.<br> I got enough troubles, Eddie.<br> Actually, you look terrible, Tom.<br> You're not even cute anymore.<br> If that's your idea of seduction,<br> no wonder you're alone.<br> Well, it isn't easy.<br> Did you know Savannah was seeing<br> a psychiatrist?<br> Of course. I recommended her.<br> She's a friend of mine.<br> It was a bitch washing it out.<br> You found her?<br> We've been giving her 50 mgs<br> three times a day.<br> I'd bring it down to 25.<br> Don't expect too much.<br> Dr. Lowenstein, I need to see you.<br> Hey, Savannah. Hey, darling.<br> It's me. Tom.<br> I have a cancellation,<br> so why don't you meet me...<br> ...here at the hospital<br> in 45 minutes, okay?<br> I'm on the third floor.<br> What the hell is going on here?<br> Why is she strapped down?<br> Her team felt she had to<br> be restrained...<br> Why? She has enough drugs<br> to anaesthetize a whale!<br> - Her team decides...<br> - Quit calling them her team!<br> Sounds like she's trying out<br> for the Giants.<br> What should I call them?<br> Let's be creative.<br> Call them assholes.<br> Let me tell you something<br> about those assholes.<br> I'm grateful because they<br> saved your sister's life.<br> I don't like...<br> I don't care.<br> She's still a threat to herself.<br> There's no point to this<br> unless we keep Savannah alive.<br> And I don't care if it takes drugs<br> or voodoo or reading tarot cards...<br> ...I want her alive.<br> Do you understand me?<br> When I'm not picking straw out<br> of my teeth, I'm a very smart man.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean<br> to sound condescending.<br> You're tough, Lowenstein...<br> ...and I'm starving.<br> Any interest in lunch?<br> Only if you let me pay.<br> Oh, I insist.<br> I wouldn't have objected to<br> Lutce or Le Cirque.<br> Their chili isn't as good.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Tell me something.<br> Why didn't your father<br> answer my telegram?<br> Dad only likes good news.<br> Besides, the shrimp are running good.<br> And your mother? Why didn't she come?<br> She was the one I spoke to.<br> Priorities. My mother's too busy<br> hiring a caterer...<br> ...for my stepfather's birthday.<br> Do you always make jokes<br> in place of conversation?<br> It's the Southern way, ma'am.<br> The "Southern way"?<br> My mother's immortal phrase:<br> "When things get too painful,<br> we either avoid them or we laugh. "<br> When do you cry,<br> according to the Southern way?<br> We don't.<br> Jesus, even Sally makes<br> better chili than this.<br> - I have a good recipe. Interested?<br> - No, thanks. I never cook.<br> What the hell is it with you doctors?<br> Does " Callanwolde"<br> mean anything to you?<br> No. Why?<br> Savannah kept repeating it<br> when she first came out of the coma.<br> " Callanwolde, Callanwolde. " No?<br> I don't know.<br> I have to get back to the hospital.<br> It's late.<br> I can't see you tomorrow<br> till about 7:30. Okay?<br> Lowenstein!<br> What's your first name?<br> - Why?<br> - Why not?<br> It's just that my patients<br> call me Dr. Lowenstein.<br> But I'm not your patient.<br> Susan.<br> Thank you, doctor. I won't use your<br> name. I just wanted to know it.<br> Be on time.<br> - Eight bucks a pound.<br> - Eight bucks a pound? For shrimp?<br> - Are they fresh?<br> - Yeah!<br> They're today's. They're gorgeous.<br> - I'll take a pound.<br> - Let me at the scale.<br> Shrimp Newburg? For chrissakes,<br> Lila, it's got wine in it!<br> It's garbage!<br> It's elegant food, Henry. And it's<br> gonna get me into Colleton League.<br> That's a joke. Why do you think<br> they got a Colleton League?<br> To keep people like you out.<br> Joop!<br> Why do you want to join anyway, Mama,<br> if they don't want you?<br> Of course they want me.<br> They just don't know it yet.<br> Even the dog won't eat it.<br> Goddamn it! I work hard all day long<br> to come home and eat this shit?<br> I think it's good.<br> - Who asked you?<br> - Nobody.<br> Nobody.<br> Tip your head up, boy.<br> You ain't gonna cry, are you?<br> What did I tell you about crying?<br> What did I tell you about<br> crying in this house?<br> Put the hands in your lap.<br> Sit up straight!<br> Come on, sit up straight.<br> You gonna cry now?<br> Savannah, get this little girl<br> one of your dresses.<br> Why are you so mean?<br> Henry, why don't I get you<br> another supper?<br> There's leftover hash and rice.<br> I'll heat it up.<br> Give me a hand, Tom.<br> You go out in the kitchen<br> with the rest of the girls.<br> Bully on somebody your own size.<br> Can't anyone take a joke around here?<br> I'll help, Mama.<br> I want you to melt<br> this butter, Savannah.<br> Heat up this rice. You chop that<br> onion into fine little pieces, Tom.<br> And the Yankees are back out in front.<br> I'm sorry, Mama.<br> There's nothing to be sorry for.<br> Marry into nothing, you get nothing.<br> Add some pepper, Tom.<br> Hand me that Worcestershire sauce.<br> Your mouth is hanging open, child.<br> Nice and spicy.<br> All I want is a good,<br> plain American meal!<br> Here you go, darling.<br> Now, this is food, Lila.<br> Eat up, children.<br> So your mother fed him dog food, huh?<br> He even asked for a second helping.<br> Maybe you got your sense<br> of humor from your mother.<br> Very funny.<br> She called today, very concerned<br> about Savannah.<br> Don't believe a word she says.<br> She's a liar.<br> That's interesting. She said<br> you'd tell lies about her.<br> That figures.<br> I saw Herbert Woodruff come out of your<br> office. He sure can play the fiddle.<br> You're changing the subject.<br> What's wrong with him?<br> Just kidding.<br> I can't believe anybody<br> with that kind of money has troubles.<br> - Are you really that provincial?<br> - Oh, hell, yes. So is Savannah.<br> When we were kids, the only way<br> to get off our island was by boat.<br> We grew up on a tidal plain.<br> A tidal plain? What does that mean?<br> Tides mean everything, Lowenstein.<br> They measure everything.<br> Moods, seasons,<br> the time to plant...<br> ...to fish, to mate.<br> It's primitive. Biological clocks<br> ticking all over the place.<br> Sounds like a nice way to live.<br> What else did she say, my mother?<br> She said that she was the one who<br> encouraged Savannah to become a poet.<br> Is that true?<br> Jesus Christ!<br> That woman has no shame.<br> Wanna know how<br> she encouraged Savannah?<br> - By burning her childhood journals.<br> - Why'd she burn them?<br> Because Savannah was being disloyal,<br> writing about our hideous family.<br> What's hideous about your family?<br> Are you asking me to be disloyal?<br> If that's what it takes<br> to help Savannah, yes.<br> Aren't we about done?<br> What time is it?<br> We still have a few more minutes.<br> What did Savannah do after your<br> mother burned her journals?<br> She took her fingers, and she<br> wrote in the sand.<br> And then she wrote in the air.<br> She wrote poetry so mother<br> wouldn't understand it.<br> Your mother helped to create a poet.<br> Bullshit, Lowenstein.<br> She created a schizophrenic.<br> My mother should've raised cobras,<br> not children.<br> Can you tell me anything good<br> about your parents?<br> No.<br> Try.<br> They did two really good things:<br> Luke and Savannah.<br> Incredible people.<br> Passionate, defiant, not for sale.<br> What about you?<br> Oh, I was a courteous Southern boy<br> that did what he was told.<br> I was responsible and normal and dull.<br> I don't know what normal is,<br> and you're anything but dull.<br> Compared to them, I was.<br> Your sister's in the hospital,<br> and your brother's dead.<br> You must be doing something right.<br> You can go now.<br> Time's up.<br> Good night.<br> "Women and men<br> Both little and small<br> Cared for anyone not at all<br> They sowed their isn't<br> They reaped their same<br> Sun, moon, stars, rain<br> Children guessed<br> But only a few<br> And down they forgot<br> As up they grew. "<br> So this began a series<br> of confessional days...<br> ... when I spun out the history<br> of Savannah's past...<br> ... in order to keep her alive.<br> By the second week,<br> I'd developed the New York willies.<br> The guilt that every<br> out-of-towner feels...<br> ... if he's not improving his mind<br> every goddamn second.<br> I made a list of things I should do.<br> Museums, plays, run six miles<br> in under 50 minutes.<br> See three foreign films<br> all at the same time.<br> Anything not to feel guilty.<br> Tom, how old was Savannah when you<br> first realized...<br> ... something was wrong with her?<br> About seven or eight.<br> Anything specific happen?<br> My mother had a baby at home.<br> It was stillborn.<br> She told us it died<br> because we were bad.<br> Anyway, we were gonna bury it<br> the next day...<br> ...so Dad wrapped it in some towels<br> and put it in the freezer.<br> That night, I got up<br> to get a drink of water...<br> ...and I saw Savannah sitting<br> in the rocking chair...<br> ...with the dead baby in her arms.<br> She was saying...<br> ..."You're the lucky one because you<br> don't have to live with us. "<br> Did you say anything to her?<br> The next day I did, but she didn't<br> remember anything about it.<br> When I told her, she said...<br> ..."Why would anyone do a crazy thing<br> like that?"<br> So you were her memory even then?<br> I guess so.<br> Goddamn locks!<br> I'm coming! I'm coming!<br> What was that again?<br> I'm learning to speak the language<br> of the natives here. Hi, Sally.<br> How's it going down there?<br> It's just sort of blowing up a storm.<br> I got the girls' drawings.<br> - Did they get my letters?<br> - Yes, and they loved them.<br> Good! Did you get my letter?<br> Tom?<br> It's not a good idea for you<br> to come home this weekend.<br> Why not?<br> I'm just not sure that I want<br> to see you right now.<br> I have a lot to figure out.<br> What's the point, Tom?<br> I mean, let's face it...<br> ... we don't make each other<br> feel good anymore.<br> Right.<br> Look...<br> ...I didn't want to tell you this<br> on the telephone.<br> I wanted to tell you before you left.<br> But the way you left...<br> ...there wasn't any time.<br> What did you want to tell me, Sally?<br> What's his name?<br> What's his name, Sally?<br> The man must have a name.<br> Jack Cleveland.<br> Oh, no. Oh, no!<br> Oh, Jesus, Sally!<br> Jack Cleveland?<br> That aging, pompous hippie from the<br> hospital who still rides a motorcycle?<br> Oh, for chrissakes, Sally!<br> Why him?<br> Why him?<br> Because he knows how he<br> feels about me.<br> Oh, Sally.<br> This is too difficult to talk<br> about over the phone.<br> Just think about it carefully, okay?<br> I hardly think about anything else.<br> Good night, Tom.<br> What?<br> Are you really in love?<br> I'm not sure.<br> I might even be doing this to hurt you.<br> I gotta go.<br> Dear Sally:<br> I wish the words,<br> "I love you"...<br> ... weren't so<br> difficult for me.<br> I've missed you.<br> I miss touching you.<br> I don't know what keeps me<br> at such a distance.<br> I'm sorry I disappoint you, Sally...<br> ... but you're right to feel that way.<br> How else could you react<br> to half a man?<br> How could you not be disappointed?<br> Hell, I seem to disappoint anyone who<br> tries to find the best in me.<br> Tom?<br> Ma'am?<br> Come on in here.<br> Come on, lie beside me. Come on.<br> You're the only Wingo<br> who's gonna amount to something.<br> Luke can't do it,<br> because he isn't smart.<br> Savannah can't,<br> because she's just a girl.<br> - But Luke's smart, Mama.<br> - Not like you.<br> Or me.<br> Nobody knows this yet...<br> ...but I'm an amazing woman.<br> Do you believe that?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I'm not gonna die in a house<br> like this. I promise you that.<br> Something else, Tom.<br> I love you<br> more than I love any of them.<br> - But, Mama!<br> - I do.<br> I can't help it.<br> You're my favorite.<br> That's gonna be our little secret.<br> You keep a secret?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Can I go now?<br> Not till you tell me you love me.<br> I love you, Mama.<br> It took me 20 years to tell Luke<br> and Savannah about my secret.<br> And when I did, they just fell<br> on the floor, howling.<br> My mother took each of them<br> into that room...<br> ...and told them exactly<br> the same thing.<br> Why did you tell me that story?<br> To prove that Lila Wingo would...<br> Just to show why Savannah<br> could never trust her.<br> You mean why you could<br> never trust her.<br> I'm sorry. That's the wrong story.<br> Let's just skip it...<br> ...and I'll try<br> to think of a better one.<br> What's bothering you?<br> Global warming, acid rain,<br> the national debt...<br> And my wife's having an affair with<br> a heart surgeon in South Carolina.<br> Jesus! I feel like such an idiot.<br> I never even knew it was going on.<br> - Maybe you weren't paying attention.<br> - Bullshit!<br> Let's face it, Lowenstein.<br> Women are more devious than men.<br> You're great at hiding things. You<br> keep secrets. You smile when you lie.<br> You expect a man to be<br> a tower of strength.<br> When he's got a few weaknesses<br> and insecurities...<br> ...what do you do? You turn around,<br> and goddamn it, you betray him!<br> You feel that your mother<br> betrayed you?<br> I was talking about my wife!<br> Oh, God, I hate this Freudian crap.<br> It's not your job to listen<br> to my problems. I'd like to go.<br> You're free to leave anytime.<br> Good!<br> Goddamn shrink.<br> Who was I kidding?<br> I was a champion at keeping secrets.<br> Better than any woman.<br> Until Susan Lowenstein came along.<br> A man who never talked...<br> ... now is doing nothing else.<br> Her questions making me<br> as dizzy as her perfume.<br> Excuse me.<br> Would you like to dance?<br> - Who, me?<br> - Yes, you.<br> Come on.<br> Come on, just loosen up!<br> Hands to yourself!<br> He's spoken for.<br> How's Savannah?<br> When can I see her?<br> I don't know, Eddie.<br> It's like talking to a fern.<br> I'm glad she's improving.<br> Come on, let's dance.<br> Give me a break, Eddie.<br> I'm a lousy dancer.<br> Walk on the wild side.<br> You're in the big city.<br> Oh, hell. All right...<br> God, you are a lousy dancer!<br> Go mingle.<br> Get in here.<br> Get into the party.<br> Where are my chairs?<br> I found four of them,<br> and I have a lead on another two.<br> Roberta, have I got a settee for you!<br> Don't laugh.<br> - You're laughing!<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I'm surprised to see you here.<br> Why? I like Eddie.<br> You know, I...<br> You really pissed me off today.<br> But you made me think<br> about some things.<br> Don't make it a habit,<br> or I'll charge you.<br> Oh, we do have a sense of humor!<br> I thought you had it<br> surgically removed.<br> You look mighty pretty tonight.<br> Thank you.<br> Are you all right?<br> Oh, God, I'm great. I'm just great.<br> Now that I finished lying,<br> can I ask you to dance?<br> No?<br> You'd be the first woman<br> I've danced with in New York.<br> I'd rather not.<br> Come on, Lowenstein.<br> Walk on the wild side.<br> It's a party. Come on.<br> Don't worry, I can't dance and make a<br> pass at the same time. I lose count.<br> You came alone?<br> Yeah, it's funny. I never went<br> anywhere alone until I got married.<br> Well, that speaks well<br> for matrimony.<br> No, it's just that...<br> ...my husband travels a lot.<br> What does he do?<br> You know, it's late.<br> I really should go.<br> - I'll take you home.<br> - No, it's okay. I'm fine.<br> I'm a Southerner, ma'am.<br> We take our ladies home.<br> How do you do it?<br> How do you listen to people's sob<br> stories? Doesn't it depress you?<br> No, not if I think I can help them.<br> Anyway, you learn to separate your<br> patients' problems from your own.<br> Now yours, I think I could handle.<br> Oh, yeah? Don't be so sure.<br> Tell me something.<br> Did you ever want to write<br> like Savannah?<br> You're changing the subject,<br> Lowenstein.<br> Am I?<br> It's a technique<br> I'm learning from you.<br> There he is again. You see him?<br> That guy is following me.<br> So you're a shrink to the stars, huh?<br> He's not my patient.<br> He's my husband.<br> Really? Herbert-fucking-Woodruff<br> is your husband?<br> Herbert Woodruff is my husband, yes.<br> How'd you meet him?<br> I saw him perform at...<br> ...Carnegie Hall. I was 22 years old.<br> I had never heard anything like it.<br> I mean, that kind of...<br> ...passion, artistry, whatever<br> you call it. It's like Savannah's.<br> They have that gift<br> to make people feel.<br> I fell in love with him instantly.<br> So you married him, and then<br> you lived happily ever after, huh?<br> I married him.<br> Are you saying mine isn't<br> the only screwed up union?<br> - I'm not telling you anything more.<br> - Wait. No fair. I spill my guts.<br> I tell you my marriage is full<br> of holes. But you got nothing to say?<br> I think it's your turn<br> to give a little.<br> Come on, Lowenstein, be human.<br> Talk to me.<br> - Tell me about yourself.<br> - I can't.<br> Why are there never any cabs?<br> I'll ask you a few simple questions,<br> and you just answer.<br> - Simple?<br> - Very simple.<br> - What's your father's name?<br> - Douglas.<br> What's your favorite car?<br> I like old Ford Woodies.<br> Good! Who's the first boy<br> you ever kissed?<br> Dick Berkowitz. He was very cute.<br> Do you have any idea how beautiful<br> you look in that suit?<br> Is this " Make Lowenstein<br> Feel Better Day"?<br> And you got a great smile.<br> You should smile more.<br> - Stop.<br> - You don't believe me, do you?<br> Come here. Let me show you something.<br> Come here. Let me show you.<br> - A painting?<br> - No, you. Look at you.<br> You. Your face,<br> your smile, your suit.<br> - Great stuff here. Beautiful.<br> - Okay, you convinced me.<br> Now, would you please get me a cab?<br> Come up for a minute.<br> I'd like you to meet my son.<br> Sure. Okay.<br> Come on in.<br> Bernard?<br> I'd like you to meet a friend.<br> How do you do?<br> - Mind stepping out of the way?<br> - Oh, excuse me.<br> Mr. Wingo is<br> a football coach, Bernard.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Dad called from Vienna today.<br> Said to say hi to you when I saw you.<br> Did you practice this afternoon?<br> No, I've been too busy watching TV.<br> You're being rude, Bernard.<br> No, he's being a teenager.<br> I used to be one myself.<br> No kidding?<br> Where are you from?<br> Your accent's weird.<br> South Carolina.<br> - Is this TV or...?<br> - I'm trying to watch this movie.<br> All right, it's late. Come on.<br> It's time for bed, Bernard.<br> Let's go.<br> - Turn down the TV and go to bed.<br> - I'll see you, Bernard.<br> I'm sorry that he was so rude to you.<br> You don't have to apologize,<br> Lowenstein.<br> Teenagers, by definition,<br> are not fit for society.<br> That's true.<br> Bernard wants to play football.<br> That's why I brought you to meet him.<br> I thought that maybe you could<br> coach him a couple of days a week.<br> You see, he never gets a chance<br> to play while his father's around.<br> Herbert's on tour.<br> I thought maybe...<br> Is this a job offer?<br> Yes, and I would insist on paying you.<br> What would you consider<br> a reasonable rate?<br> What are your rates?<br> I charge $150 an hour.<br> Fine, I'll take it.<br> You must be a very good coach.<br> Forget it, Lowenstein.<br> I'm not a charity case yet.<br> Tell Bernard we'll start Monday.<br> Good. Good night.<br> First rule of thumb, Bernard.<br> Never be late.<br> I didn't want to come anyway, okay?<br> Your mother thinks you want to play.<br> Is that true?<br> Maybe, maybe not.<br> Where do you coach, Mr. Wingo?<br> Hillbilly country?<br> We're a little<br> class-conscious, are we?<br> Do you go to Miss Porter's?<br> Phillips Exeter, smart-ass.<br> You didn't get to play last year,<br> did you?<br> How'd you know?<br> Because any snot-nosed punk that<br> would dare call his coach a smart-ass...<br> ...wouldn't get to haul water,<br> let alone play.<br> With your attitude, you belong<br> in the bleachers, kid.<br> When you want to play football,<br> get my number from your mother.<br> Catch.<br> You need help.<br> This is not an attractive look<br> for a middle-aged man.<br> You can take me shopping. Did you<br> ever hear of Renata Halpern?<br> No, who is she?<br> I don't know, but she writes poems<br> about growing up Jewish in Brooklyn.<br> Was she staying<br> with Savannah recently?<br> Not that I know of. Of course,<br> I've been out of town a lot.<br> - Bloomingdale's on Saturday, big boy.<br> - Okay.<br> Coach Wingo?<br> You know, yesterday, I...<br> You know, I...<br> I accept your apology, Bernard.<br> I didn't play last year,<br> because I never made the team.<br> They made fun of me.<br> If I coach you, I promise<br> they won't make fun of you.<br> But you gotta promise something.<br> You gotta shut up, Bernard.<br> Your mouth pisses me off.<br> "Yes, sir" is the way<br> to address me.<br> First thing we'll do<br> is follow certain courtesies.<br> You'll do whatever I tell you<br> and do it with enthusiasm.<br> I'm gonna teach you<br> to play football well.<br> - I'll run your ass off every day.<br> - I have my violin lessons.<br> - Shut up, Bernard.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> After I run you till you drop,<br> make you lift weights...<br> ...tackle till your arms cramp...<br> ...something will happen to you<br> that's never happened in your life.<br> What's that, sir?<br> You're gonna be happy, kid.<br> Keep moving. Move them.<br> Hit it!<br> Come on! Get up.<br> Drop that leg. Roll.<br> Drop this leg. Roll.<br> That's it. All right,<br> let's see that smile.<br> Do it again with a smile.<br> Cross. Back. Cross.<br> That's it. Cross them over. Cross!<br> Bring this shoulder out.<br> This shoulder.<br> Keep your eyes on the ball.<br> Concentrate!<br> Come on, Bernard.<br> Get your hands up.<br> Get it. Look behind!<br> Turn around and run!<br> You're the greatest person<br> in the whole world, Daddy.<br> What? I don't even get the pleasure<br> of asking the questions anymore?<br> - When you coming home, Daddy?<br> - Soon.<br> Well, if you miss my birthday,<br> I'm gonna kill you.<br> Chandler, how could I miss<br> your birthday?<br> I was there the day you pushed<br> your way into the world.<br> I want an alligator!<br> You go down to the marsh<br> and you get one.<br> I want a stuffed alligator<br> to sleep in bed with me.<br> That's a dangerous habit to get<br> into, kiddo. Is Mama there?<br> Daddy wants to talk to you.<br> Oh, hi, Sal.<br> I want to come home<br> for Chandler's birthday.<br> It would only be...<br> We'd all be upset if you<br> didn't come, Tom.<br> Oh, good. Well, thanks, Sally.<br> Okay. I'll talk to you. Bye.<br> All right. Bye-bye.<br> Hustle. Hustle. Hustle!<br> - You got a broken cigarette.<br> - You gonna take it away?<br> So this became my routine.<br> Coaching Bernard in the morning...<br> ... and in the afternoon, telling the<br> Wingo family secrets to his mother.<br> And looking forward to telling them.<br> Or looking forward to seeing her.<br> It's as if Savannah has<br> some kind of a splinter...<br> ...that she's neglected. It festers.<br> It festers inside you until you...<br> ...you get it out.<br> You know what I mean?<br> The stories you're telling me<br> are helping her remember...<br> ...and I'm very proud<br> of the work we're doing.<br> Know what I mean?<br> Time's up. Out.<br> Lowenstein.<br> - Here. Catch.<br> - My nails!<br> - Throw me the ball.<br> - Throw you the ball?<br> Coach, are you trying to kill yourself?<br> - I'm not quitting, Bernard. You hear?<br> - Then I'll smoke.<br> No, you're not smoking.<br> You're not smoking.<br> Then throw them out.<br> - All right. I will.<br> - All of them.<br> All right. All right!<br> - Congratulations. How do you feel?<br> - I feel better already.<br> You know, it's an art form<br> to hate New York properly.<br> No, it's not. It's a clich.<br> You're not such a dumb kid after all.<br> Let's go to the bookstore.<br> It's my daughter's birthday.<br> She wants an alligator.<br> There's a crocodile in Peter Pan.<br> Think she'll buy it?<br> It's my mom's birthday next week.<br> I bet you got her exactly nothing.<br> Come on, we'll see if we can<br> find her something.<br> Shit! Shit.<br> Who's Renata Halpern?<br> What's she to do with my sister?<br> Sit down and cool off.<br> You knew about this, didn't you?<br> It's difficult to conduct a session...<br> It's not a session!<br> I'm asking you a question.<br> You're doing a shitty job<br> of evading it. Who wrote this?<br> What's so disturbing?<br> That's not the issue.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> It wasn't my place to...<br> You're a piece of work.<br> I tell you everything, and you<br> withhold important information!<br> - Maybe you're withholding.<br> - It's not about me!<br> Why are you so upset?<br> I don't like being lied to.<br> I don't like secrets.<br> I could report you.<br> Have your license suspended.<br> Stop acting like a petulant child.<br> You haven't answered me.<br> Who wrote this book?<br> You tell me.<br> I will. My sister wrote it.<br> It's all about my goddamn family.<br> If my mother read it,<br> she'd rip out Savannah's pancreas.<br> Why? Why would she do that?<br> What are you hiding?<br> I don't answer any more questions<br> till you answer mine.<br> Then sit down and listen.<br> That is, if you're not too exhausted<br> by your temper tantrum.<br> Shit!<br> When Savannah came to see me, she<br> told me her name was Renata Halpern.<br> - She's even crazier than I thought.<br> - Shut up, or I won't continue.<br> She said her father was a furrier and<br> both parents were Holocaust survivors.<br> She couldn't fool me about being<br> Jewish, but what fascinated me...<br> ...was why she was<br> the child of survivors.<br> What was, or is<br> she trying to survive?<br> - How would I know?<br> - I think you do.<br> You're supposed to be answering me.<br> Why'd she do it?<br> Writing made her want<br> to be someone else.<br> - That was okay with you?<br> - It wasn't okay.<br> I said she had to resolve her<br> problems, or she'd have no chance.<br> People pay you for this?<br> To turn them into someone else?<br> You're not listening!<br> What do you think I do every day?<br> - Complaining! Avoiding!<br> - Fuck you, Lowenstein!<br> Fuck you, Sigmund Freud and<br> Renata Halpern. It makes me sick!<br> Your reaction makes me sick!<br> What do you expect?<br> What if I'd done this to your son?<br> It's not the same thing!<br> I'll make him<br> a Presbyterian quarterback!<br> It's quite different.<br> My son didn't try to kill himself.<br> Give him time, Lowenstein.<br> Give him time!<br> You son of a bitch!<br> My God, I'll go get you some ice.<br> I see a malpractice suit coming<br> out of this, doctor.<br> I am so embarrassed.<br> What a day.<br> I get dropped by a dictionary...<br> ...and I find out my sister's<br> become a Brooklyn Jew.<br> Here. Here.<br> I don't need that.<br> I'd rather bleed to death.<br> Just be quiet and take it.<br> After you've stopped bleeding,<br> I'll take you to dinner.<br> No chili today.<br> This time it's gonna cost you.<br> This is therapy, huh?<br> Yeah, pretty bloody, isn't it?<br> I still can't believe<br> I did that to you.<br> Face it.<br> I bring out the animal in you.<br> - I owe you an apology.<br> - I accept.<br> - That was a terrible thing to say.<br> - Yes.<br> I know it. Jesus.<br> Thank you for accepting.<br> Would you like to order now?<br> We would like to order now.<br> Do you want me to order for you?<br> I eat here all the time.<br> How can I trust a woman<br> who can't even cook?<br> Just because I can't cook<br> doesn't mean I can't eat.<br> Go ahead. I'll do anything<br> to make you happy tonight.<br> I think...<br> ...we'll start with the artichaut<br> garni de champignons au safran.<br> And pour monsieur...<br> La mousse de canard<br> aux baies sauvages.<br> And then we'll have the soupe de<br> poisson au crabe. Delicious.<br> And for our main course,<br> rble de lapin.<br> The rabbit is superb.<br> God, there's nothing sexier than<br> a beautiful woman...<br> ...ordering food in French.<br> Read me the whole menu.<br> - Are you flirting with me?<br> - Yeah, I think I am.<br> I'd like you to find me attractive,<br> bloody nose and all.<br> I'd like to ask you about Savannah.<br> - Don't you ever take a night off?<br> - No.<br> You said you'd do anything to<br> make me happy. Just one thing.<br> Savannah told me her children's book<br> came out of a dream.<br> More like a nightmare.<br> Images in it terrorized her,<br> but she didn't know why.<br> Like the three stray dogs.<br> What do you think it means?<br> Lowenstein, you're incorrigible.<br> We're at a wonderful restaurant...<br> ...and you want me to interpret<br> my sister's dreams?<br> You wanna interpret dreams?<br> Do mine.<br> I had a great one about you<br> last night.<br> You had a dream about me?<br> - You wanna hear?<br> - I'm not sure.<br> Don't worry.<br> This one's G-rated.<br> This one?<br> Tell me.<br> There was a blinding snowstorm<br> right here in New York City.<br> I went out for a walk,<br> and I ran into you.<br> We decided to go to the Rainbow Room.<br> No one was there.<br> So we started to slow dance.<br> What do you think it means?<br> You said it was a snowstorm?<br> Blinding snowstorm?<br> Maybe there's something<br> you're afraid to see.<br> Maybe I wanna get to know you better.<br> Maybe you're trying to snow me.<br> Maybe I have cold feet.<br> Maybe you just miss winter.<br> Move those legs. Move them!<br> That's it. Get in position.<br> Keep your head up. Come!<br> Is that my son?<br> Is that you in there, Bernard?<br> I don't think this was<br> such a good idea.<br> Stop being a Jewish mother.<br> I am a Jewish mother.<br> I brought sandwiches.<br> Oh, good. I'm starving.<br> I got delicious ones here.<br> Take a break.<br> Great. I got one for you.<br> Slave away in the kitchen all day<br> making those?<br> I bought them as usual.<br> Would you like one?<br> No, I'm not hungry.<br> So can I watch you play?<br> I promise I won't be overprotective.<br> I don't feel like playing anymore.<br> Let's toss the ball around<br> for a few minutes.<br> Am I a trained seal?<br> I gotta do what she wants?<br> Oh, you got it tough, kid!<br> Let's lie in the grass and cry for all<br> the terrible misfortune in your life.<br> You're a jerk every time<br> my mother's around.<br> Are you trying to impress her?<br> You're out of line.<br> You're mad at me, not him.<br> Save that crap for your patients, Mom.<br> He's right, you know.<br> He's absolutely right.<br> I don't know how to talk to him.<br> Maybe you should try a new approach.<br> What's that?<br> Laugh, Lowenstein, laugh.<br> The Southern way?<br> If that doesn't work,<br> then you bop him on the head.<br> What do you think of me?<br> Well, I think you have it made.<br> You're rich. You live like a queen.<br> Your kid needs some work...<br> ...but overall, you're in<br> the top 1 percent.<br> You're lying.<br> I think you're a very sad woman,<br> Lowenstein.<br> I like it when you tell the truth.<br> I think you're the first friend<br> I've made in a long time.<br> Come on. Let's go to the movies.<br> - The movies?<br> - Yeah, come on.<br> Rare footage from<br> the Savannah Wingo archives.<br> How wonderful!<br> Where did you find this?<br> I was snooping around.<br> Savannah must've kept them.<br> Is that Luke?<br> Yeah, that's Luke.<br> He was always horsing around.<br> Oh, here's our graduation.<br> From grade school, right?<br> Yeah, right. Grade school.<br> Did you always jump in<br> with your clothes on?<br> As a matter of fact, we did.<br> - And that's your mother? Lila?<br> - Yeah, that's Miss Lila.<br> She was very pretty.<br> She still is.<br> So who took these pictures?<br> My father bought this camera one year.<br> Thought he'd give up shrimping,<br> what he was good at...<br> ...and make a fortune in film.<br> Don't ask me how.<br> Savannah said your father was<br> always losing money. Is that true?<br> An understatement. Henry Wingo<br> had the opposite of the Midas touch.<br> - Everything he touched turned to shit.<br> - What is that?<br> That is one of my father's<br> all-time cockamamie schemes.<br> - What?<br> - He bought this gas station.<br> He thought a tiger would<br> draw people by the thousands.<br> All it did is scare them<br> the hell away.<br> The only one that wasn't afraid<br> of that animal was Luke.<br> He fed him.<br> Took care of him.<br> He had a lot of courage.<br> What about you?<br> I didn't need any. I had Luke.<br> Oh, this is our island.<br> The only place Dad ever really owned.<br> By the time this was taken,<br> it was worthless.<br> Not to Luke, though.<br> To him it was the most precious place<br> in the world.<br> When he was older, he went to Vietnam.<br> He came back a hero.<br> Swore he'd never leave it again.<br> He didn't.<br> What happened?<br> Mother got the island<br> in the divorce settlement.<br> She immediately sold it to<br> the government for a lot of money.<br> They wanted to put up a power plant.<br> Luke went crazy.<br> He made some threats.<br> The government laughed.<br> He blew up a construction site.<br> They quit laughing.<br> And then?<br> He went on waging his own private war.<br> Hurt some people.<br> Savannah and I tried to stop him,<br> but the government did it first.<br> Shot him in the head. Bingo.<br> Would you like a cold drink?<br> Maybe a beer?<br> How did you deal with his death?<br> I shut down like a broken motor.<br> And according to the Southern way,<br> still no tears.<br> Oh, I cry sometimes, Lowenstein.<br> I cry at weddings, at the Olympics,<br> at the national anthem.<br> But not over Luke?<br> What the hell for?<br> It wouldn't bring him back.<br> No. But it might bring you back.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey there! Welcome back.<br> Dr. Wingo had an emergency<br> at the hospital.<br> Oh, that's all right, Megan.<br> - Are the girls asleep?<br> - Yes, for a while.<br> You can go home now.<br> Okay, I'll just get my things.<br> Hey, coach.<br> Oh, hey, Sally.<br> - How you doing?<br> - All right. Fine.<br> What's the proper form<br> in this situation?<br> Do we talk, fight,<br> or ignore the whole thing?<br> I don't know.<br> - You want some juice?<br> - Yeah.<br> How's Savannah, Tom?<br> She's one day up,<br> and then it's one day down.<br> Do you like the psychiatrist,<br> you trust her?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> What's her name again?<br> Lowenstein.<br> Want me to make a fire?<br> I don't think so.<br> It's 90 degrees outside.<br> You've always been<br> such a traditionalist.<br> Jack Cleveland wants to marry me, Tom.<br> Do you need a letter<br> of recommendation?<br> That's not funny.<br> Considering my other options,<br> it was the kindest...<br> ...most restrained thing I could say.<br> What do you wanna do?<br> I don't know.<br> Part of me just wants to pack up<br> and walk away from a life...<br> ...that doesn't seem to work anymore.<br> And part of me says<br> that no life will work...<br> ...if I can't make this one right.<br> How can I help you, Sally?<br> By trying to understand, I guess.<br> I'm sorry I made you<br> unsure of yourself.<br> I can be a closed, defensive<br> son of a bitch.<br> Sometimes.<br> Only sometimes.<br> You coming in?<br> I'll sleep here.<br> It'd be too confusing.<br> Thanks for asking, though.<br> Daddy's home!<br> Where are you, Daddy?<br> Who are these squealing piglets<br> jumping on my chest?<br> Boy, am I hungry.<br> A little mustard on you<br> would be perfect.<br> - You can't catch me.<br> - Can't catch me either!<br> Who missed me most?<br> Careful, there's money involved.<br> Get your shoes.<br> We're going on Grandpa's shrimp boat.<br> Hi, Jenny.<br> You like that sweater I got you?<br> - Yeah, it's nice, Dad.<br> - Good.<br> Are you and Mom having a bad fight?<br> No, honey. Everything's fine.<br> Y'all don't fool me.<br> Oh, boy.<br> What am I gonna do<br> with all you smart women?<br> Give me a hug.<br> Chandler, come on in<br> if you wanna help.<br> You too, Tom.<br> Mommy, I got a fishing rod<br> from Grandpa!<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - Come here, Daddy.<br> Lucy did that one.<br> - I did not.<br> - You did too.<br> I wanna decorate.<br> You can decorate.<br> It's your cake.<br> You go on and decorate.<br> You stop eating that icing.<br> - I wanted to do one.<br> - Well, okay...<br> Henry?<br> Come to the table. The children<br> are gonna blow out their candles.<br> Did you hear me?<br> It's time to sing "Happy Birthday"<br> to Tom and Savannah.<br> I'm watching TV.<br> You get over there and help your<br> children celebrate their birthday.<br> Come here, woman. Don't you ever<br> tell me what to do, Lila.<br> This is my house. You're just a guest<br> in it! Now turn the TV back on.<br> Please, Mama. It's all right!<br> Turn the TV back on.<br> You're gonna turn that TV on.<br> I was watching that.<br> I'm sick and tired of you<br> never showing me any respect!<br> TV's broken, you son of a bitch.<br> Now you can watch your kids<br> blow out their candles.<br> Grandpa, Daddy's gonna open the net.<br> I'm coming, birthday girl.<br> Bring it up.<br> Grandpa, I brought the fishing rod<br> you bought me.<br> Stand back.<br> He's getting ready to drop it.<br> - Wait, wait.<br> - Oh, hurry up, Daddy!<br> I don't know if we got<br> much shrimp.<br> Look at that.<br> The first thing you wanna do is<br> put these crabs overboard.<br> Why, Grandpa?<br> They'll die in the sun and the heat.<br> Look out for stingrays and catfish.<br> It's a long way to the hospital.<br> Look at that squiggly.<br> - Chandler?<br> - What, Grandpa?<br> I want you to do something for me.<br> Pick up a shrimp and head it.<br> I can do that.<br> You put it with your thumb.<br> Is this right, Grandpa?<br> Do it with one hand.<br> You got a knack for this, huh?<br> Fetch me that crate over there<br> for this good-for-nothing trash fish.<br> - He told me to get it.<br> - He told me.<br> I'm gonna get it for Grandpa.<br> They love you, Dad.<br> The Braves lost to the Dodgers<br> last night, 3- zip.<br> Did you know that, son?<br> Yeah, I know that, Dad.<br> - Put it there.<br> - Can I be a shrimper when I grow up?<br> You can be a shrimper like me.<br> Bye-bye, girls. I love you!<br> Write!<br> - How will you get to the airport?<br> - Don't worry, I'll get a cab.<br> You know, I never realized how much<br> I love this place till I went away.<br> "My soul grazes like a lamb...<br> ...on the beauty of indrawn tides. "<br> Remember that?<br> You wrote that to me in a letter once.<br> I used to write damn good letters,<br> didn't I?<br> You've met somebody in New York,<br> haven't you?<br> I don't know.<br> I know.<br> You are gonna do like I said. You are<br> gonna apologize to the Newburys.<br> Todd Newbury insulted our family.<br> He called us cheap white trash.<br> Then you proved him right<br> by whaling him, you stupid cracker.<br> Isn't this a lovely view?<br> I wanna go home.<br> Hush up.<br> Hello, Tom.<br> Hello, Reese.<br> I'm here to see my mother.<br> Well, come on in.<br> She's expecting you.<br> Why, thank you!<br> It is awful good of you<br> to see us, Reese.<br> Well, it's my pleasure.<br> You looking mighty pretty today,<br> as usual.<br> Why, I always say the most successful<br> men are always the nicest.<br> Lila, if you just have a seat here...<br> ...Tom and I are gonna have<br> a little talk in my study.<br> It's Oriental carpet.<br> From the Orient.<br> If you ever touch my son again...<br> ...you're gonna be crab bait<br> all over this river, boy.<br> A Wingo never touches a Newbury.<br> If you tell anybody I hit you...<br> ...I'm gonna run your family<br> clean out of this town.<br> Now get out of here.<br> I think it's more humid<br> than New York City.<br> Hello, darling.<br> Wealth becomes you, Mama.<br> You really got what you wanted,<br> didn't you?<br> Don't start, please.<br> Tell me about Savannah.<br> She still has a long way to go.<br> I cut out a whole slew of articles<br> on mental illness.<br> I want you to give them<br> to her psychiatrist.<br> I will, Lila. I will.<br> What are you telling<br> Savannah's doctor?<br> Anything that might help her<br> get better.<br> Go on. Drink your tea<br> before the ice melts.<br> I'm gonna tell Dr. Lowenstein<br> about Callanwolde.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> Oh, yeah, you do, Mama.<br> Yeah, you do.<br> We made a promise<br> never to speak about that.<br> I expect you to keep it.<br> We were kids. It was a stupid promise.<br> And I think...<br> ...it'd help to talk about it.<br> This is my life too. It's private.<br> I wanna keep it private.<br> At the expense of helping<br> your daughter?<br> - Stop exaggerating.<br> - Don't make me feel bad about this.<br> - I didn't have to tell you.<br> - I don't wanna talk about it.<br> That's always been the problem!<br> Your problem is,<br> you dwell too much on the past.<br> I never look back.<br> When I say goodbye to something...<br> ...I close the door,<br> and never think about it.<br> How about Luke?<br> What?<br> Do you ever think about Luke?<br> Does he ever cross your mind?<br> Who taught you to be so cruel?<br> You did, Mama.<br> You did.<br> You also taught me that even though<br> someone nearly destroys your life...<br> ...you can still feel love for them.<br> Is that supposed to warm<br> a mother's heart?<br> You have to be patient<br> with me, Lila.<br> You've done a lot to piss me off.<br> There's so much noise in New York.<br> Sirens, horns, screaming.<br> Cream, no sugar, right?<br> Oh, yeah, thanks.<br> I have something to tell you.<br> I know.<br> I don't know how.<br> Just say it.<br> It was raining that night.<br> Mama was teaching us to dance.<br> Tom, dance with us!<br> One of the few times<br> I remember having fun.<br> Mom, I can't dance.<br> What do you mean?<br> Of course you can.<br> Hold Savannah's hand.<br> Savannah does it better than me.<br> Here you go. Turn around.<br> One, two, kick. There you go, Tom.<br> Here comes another turn.<br> Here we go.<br> Turn. That's it!<br> I wonder who that is?<br> That's it.<br> They broke into our house.<br> Three men.<br> Mama cried, "Help us, Tom. "<br> I wanted to, but I couldn't.<br> One of them raped Savannah.<br> One of them raped my mother.<br> I guess that's not the answer<br> to all of Savannah's problems...<br> ...but I thought you should know.<br> God, yes.<br> And what's Callanwolde?<br> That's the prison they escaped from.<br> How old was Savannah<br> when this happened?<br> Thirteen.<br> What were you doing<br> while this was going on?<br> I don't know.<br> You don't know?<br> Maybe you ran for help?<br> No.<br> Why not?<br> I don't know. I don't know.<br> Why do you think you didn't?<br> I don't know.<br> Just because.<br> That's a child's answer, Tom.<br> You said before...<br> ...that three men came in.<br> What happened to the third man?<br> Where was he?<br> Tom, help me!<br> Help me!<br> Stop it!<br> It's okay.<br> Tell me about him.<br> He said, " Move,<br> I'll slit your throat. "<br> Raw meat. He called me raw meat.<br> "Nothing I like better than fresh...<br> ... raw meat. "<br> What was happening to me...<br> ...was unimaginable...<br> ...literally.<br> I didn't know it could happen<br> to a boy.<br> All I wanted to do was die.<br> Especially when I saw Luke.<br> Luke, two. Mama, one.<br> While I did nothing.<br> There was nothing you could do.<br> You were just a young boy.<br> You had no weapon.<br> I'm surprised you and Savannah<br> survived it at all.<br> What happened after? I mean...<br> How did your family deal with it?<br> Your father?<br> Who said we told?<br> You didn't tell?<br> No one?<br> You must have told<br> the police or...<br> Jesus Christ, Tom.<br> Mama said, " It's over.<br> Get these carcasses outside.<br> Clean up this mess. "<br> She was insane that night.<br> "This did not happen.<br> This did not happen. "<br> She kept saying it.<br> Said the minute we talked about it...<br> ... was the minute she stopped<br> being our mother.<br> Said morning would come and everything<br> would look nicer in the sunlight.<br> And after we buried the bodies...<br> ...I went in there<br> to check on Savannah...<br> ...to see how she was doing.<br> She was trying to do<br> what Mama had said.<br> Trying to act as if<br> nothing had happened.<br> Putting her hair up in rollers.<br> Only her dress was on<br> wrong side out.<br> And when my father came home<br> for dinner...<br> ... we sat around and ate<br> as if nothing was wrong.<br> God help me.<br> I think the silence was worse<br> than the rapes.<br> Three days later, Savannah<br> tried to kill herself.<br> She could keep quiet,<br> but she couldn't lie.<br> And that's what I like<br> About the South<br> Say something, Lowenstein.<br> How do you feel?<br> Well, I feel okay.<br> I mean, I thought I'd be on the floor<br> after telling you this...<br> ...but I feel surprisingly all right.<br> - You're sure?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I mean...<br> What am I?<br> I'm relieved.<br> The laundry's clean, and the ghost's<br> out of the closet and I'm...<br> You've really learned how<br> to cover your pain.<br> You've done that all your life.<br> That 13-year-old boy is<br> still in a lot of pain.<br> Don't do this to me, Lowenstein.<br> Don't do this to me.<br> I can feel your pain, Tom.<br> I feel it.<br> Let yourself feel it.<br> It takes courage to feel the pain.<br> You can do it. You can handle it.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> It's okay.<br> You've kept it locked up for so long.<br> Just let it go.<br> Let it go.<br> You have so much to cry about,<br> don't you?<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay.<br> Feel the pain.<br> Cry.<br> Cry.<br> Feel the pain.<br> It's the only way to heal yourself.<br> Just let it go.<br> Let it go.<br> I'm too old for this shit.<br> Come on, coach.<br> Let's do it again.<br> Out of shape and past your prime?<br> Come here.<br> I don't mean anything personal<br> by this...<br> ...but I'm gonna leave cleat marks<br> all over your face.<br> It felt great putting you<br> on your ass.<br> All right, you ready?<br> Set!<br> Hut!<br> Go! Come on, come on, come on.<br> I can't believe I'm being outplayed<br> by a violinist.<br> Come on. Give an old man a hand.<br> Now I'm gonna get you<br> if I can't teach you football.<br> Dad.<br> This is how your mother lets you<br> spend the summer?<br> Professor Greenberg said you've<br> skipped two lessons this week.<br> I don't like him. He's a creep.<br> He's strict.<br> The great teachers usually are.<br> I'm Tom Wingo, Mr. Woodruff.<br> Bernard's football coach.<br> It's a pleasure, Mr. Wingo.<br> Heard a lot about you.<br> Let's call it quits.<br> Go home and practice your fiddle.<br> Maybe we can<br> work something out tomorrow.<br> I had no idea he was so strong.<br> He's a good football player.<br> I don't want him playing<br> the violin with broken fingers.<br> He said you'd be worried.<br> He's careful.<br> He should be worried.<br> I'm sorry to cut your session short...<br> ...but I've enrolled Bernard<br> in the last two weeks at Tanglewood.<br> With a little discipline, he might<br> actually become a good musician.<br> You're the maestro.<br> I'm glad you understand.<br> Susan and I are having<br> a dinner party next Friday.<br> Why don't you join us?<br> Thanks, I'll look forward to it.<br> - How are you?<br> - Oh, I'm okay.<br> Good.<br> How is she?<br> Considering what she's been through<br> this week, she's doing well.<br> Can I see her?<br> I think she'd like that.<br> How you doing, darling?<br> I'm still here.<br> So...<br> So...<br> I don't know what to say.<br> Then just let me hold you.<br> Tom, I'm so sorry I put you<br> through all this.<br> No, no, you did me a favor.<br> But just don't do it again.<br> I couldn't bear to think of a world<br> without you in it, sweetheart.<br> - I hear it's pretty up in Tanglewood.<br> - Who gives a shit?<br> - I wrote the coach at your school, pal.<br> - Why?<br> I told him I was sending back a hell<br> of a ballplayer. You're a tough kid.<br> I am?<br> You took everything I dished out<br> and came back asking for more.<br> You're the best coach I ever had.<br> Well, I'm the only coach you ever had.<br> No, I mean teacher.<br> You're the best teacher I ever had.<br> Thanks. It's been a long time<br> since a student of mine said that.<br> Why'd you quit?<br> I thought I should do<br> something better with my life.<br> Like what?<br> Well, that's a good question.<br> I'm not sure.<br> Can't you go back to it?<br> I don't know if they'd want me.<br> I could write a letter.<br> Tell me where to send it.<br> Thanks, but I want you<br> to do something else.<br> Play the violin.<br> Your father says you're good.<br> - Here? Now?<br> - Sure, why not?<br> Cheer this joint up.<br> I'm a bit embarrassed. People will<br> think I want them to throw money.<br> Well, what's wrong<br> with a few extra bucks?<br> I guess I'll play this thing<br> I've kind of been working on.<br> All right.<br> If I could play the violin like that,<br> I'd never touch a football.<br> What's wrong with doing both?<br> Absolutely nothing.<br> Absolutely nothing.<br> Here you go. Put this on.<br> You gotta hurry.<br> You don't wanna miss your train.<br> My father hates you, Coach Wingo.<br> Yeah, but he loves you.<br> Come here.<br> Goodbye, Bernard.<br> - I'm gonna miss you.<br> - Me too.<br> - I'll write to you, okay?<br> - You better. You better!<br> And don't smoke.<br> You might be needing this.<br> I thought classical pianists were...<br> ...supposed to be pinched<br> and anaemic-looking.<br> I'll sit you next to her<br> in case you wanna make a pass.<br> No, thanks. She's not my type.<br> Good.<br> Why do you say that?<br> I think she's having an affair<br> with my husband.<br> You've met everyone?<br> I'm intimidated.<br> Madison Kingsley's my favorite writer.<br> Talk to him.<br> I'm gonna check on dinner.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm delighted you're here.<br> I'm delighted I heard you<br> play in person again.<br> What? Again?<br> Yes, I saw you at the Charleston<br> Music Festival last summer.<br> - Brahms' violin concerto.<br> - Bartk.<br> You ever seen a Stradivarius up close?<br> This is the finest instrument<br> ever made.<br> Everyone, I'm going to play something<br> in Mr. Wingo's honor.<br> It's not that often we have<br> Southern guests, huh?<br> What would you like to hear?<br> I'm afraid I don't know many...<br> ...football songs.<br> Anything's fine with me.<br> Damn it all, Herb, that Mozart<br> sure cranked out some snappy tunes.<br> Could you do me a favor and fix me<br> a Scotch and soda, please?<br> Yes, sir. Yes, sir.<br> Who is he?<br> That's a friend of Susan's.<br> Some football coach.<br> Charming.<br> The food is wonderful.<br> Is it the same cook as last year?<br> - Yes. I'm glad you like it.<br> - A minor artist.<br> How can you dismiss his work<br> as unimportant, Spencer?<br> It's hanging in the goddamn<br> Metropolitan.<br> Well, Madison, so is toilet paper.<br> Tom, talk to Madison. He's a great<br> admirer of Southern authors.<br> Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor,<br> Eudora Welty.<br> I love all those<br> renegade Confederates.<br> You mean you love<br> excess and eccentricity.<br> It's true. They're all mad<br> as hatters, aren't they?<br> I suppose you know a few things<br> about madness.<br> A bit.<br> Tom's sister is Savannah Wingo.<br> Are you familiar with her work?<br> Yes. She's good.<br> Very good.<br> She's Susan's patient.<br> I don't think that's appropriate.<br> Everyone knows you're the great psychic<br> healer of the literary community.<br> I'm surprised you don't get a share<br> of their royalties.<br> What have you been drinking?<br> You should ask Tom. He poured it.<br> Were you trying to poison me?<br> Not intentionally.<br> But you know how<br> the subconscious mind works.<br> I like you, Tom.<br> I like your feistiness,<br> your Tara-like pride.<br> You said you wouldn't do this.<br> You're right.<br> I shouldn't pick on Tom.<br> I'll pick on you for turning my son<br> into Quasimodo in a football uniform.<br> I can't believe you'd let Bernard play<br> a game that'd hurt his hands.<br> I can't believe you'd come here.<br> We all know you're fucking my husband.<br> I think you owe Monique an apology,<br> Susan.<br> I think you owe me an apology,<br> you son of a bitch.<br> Darling, where's your sense of humor?<br> Madison, what's the name of the<br> character in your play?<br> I'm calling him S.B.<br> And he's modeled after a character<br> sitting right at this table.<br> Not me, I hope.<br> Yoo-hoo, Herbert! Southern boy's got<br> ahold of your fiddle!<br> What'd he say?<br> Better hurry, now!<br> It's getting heavy!<br> - Herbert, what's taking you so long?<br> - What do you think you're doing?<br> Darling, where's your sense of humor?<br> That Stradivarius is worth<br> over $1 million!<br> Well, if I drop it,<br> it won't be worth shit.<br> Don't do it, Tom.<br> - Apologize to your wife.<br> - You're bluffing.<br> I may be. But it's a powerful bluff,<br> isn't it, asshole?<br> I'm sorry, Susan!<br> Sincerity becomes you, Herbie.<br> Apologize to me for your unforgivable<br> breach of etiquette at the table...<br> ...you possum-breathed cocksucker.<br> I'm very sorry, Tom.<br> You all sure know how to give a party<br> up here in New York City.<br> Tom, wait!<br> Now I know why you always<br> seem so sad.<br> Please take me with you.<br> Let me warn you...<br> ...the thought of falling in love<br> terrifies me.<br> Then let's just be friends.<br> Very good friends.<br> I think I like adultery.<br> That's why they made it a sin.<br> Repent, sinners!<br> Cast your lot with the Lord!<br> After last night,<br> I'll need some repenting.<br> - Oh, I'm in trouble.<br> - What? What?<br> Tell me. Why are you in trouble?<br> I'm starting to like this city.<br> What made you change your mind?<br> You have to ask?<br> I'm neurotic. I need reassurance.<br> Lowenstein, you could make me<br> change my mind about anything.<br> Hi, Tom. Hot baked goods.<br> Did I interrupt something vile?<br> Well, hello, Susan!<br> You look fabulous this morning.<br> I'm so glad you both got laid.<br> Hi, Eddie.<br> Do you like a little butter<br> on your croissant, darling?<br> Ask him.<br> Guess what?<br> I spoke to Bernard today...<br> ... and he asked me to come visit him.<br> I couldn't believe it.<br> That's great. That's fantastic.<br> I'm so grateful to you, Tom Wingo.<br> It was nothing, nothing.<br> Come on, cut it out.<br> This is the property.<br> It goes all the way around.<br> All the way over there.<br> Isn't it beautiful?<br> Not as beautiful as you.<br> Oh, sweetheart.<br> This is it. Herbert never liked it,<br> you know. It made him sneeze.<br> I miss the fresh smell<br> of carbon monoxide, myself.<br> I can't believe we're<br> only an hour from New York!<br> South Carolina's not the only<br> state with trees.<br> In my next life,<br> I wanna be you, Lowenstein.<br> I'll make lots of money from crazy<br> people, have a city penthouse...<br> ...a great country house<br> and a guy like me.<br> - Come on. I wanna show you around.<br> - All right.<br> Look, isn't it pretty?<br> Darling, you just broke a dozen eggs.<br> I don't care.<br> You know what I thought<br> when I first saw you?<br> I thought, "Jesus, she hates me.<br> Why does she make me feel<br> so damn stupid?"<br> What do you think now?<br> Right now?<br> I'm thinking, "Why does she make me<br> feel so damn good?"<br> Because she loves you.<br> Lowenstein, Lowenstein.<br> Maybe I should be<br> calling you "Susan" now.<br> No, I love the way you<br> say "Lowenstein. "<br> You know...<br> ...before I met you,<br> I was in a deep sleep...<br> ...and I didn't even know it.<br> I'm afraid.<br> Of what, sweetheart?<br> What's gonna happen<br> when Sally wants you back?<br> She wants you back, you know.<br> What makes you so sure?<br> I've sampled the merchandise.<br> Oh, my God!<br> - Spread them wide.<br> - You dirty thing!<br> I'm not being dirty.<br> Spread them this way.<br> Now, you gotta tackle me.<br> Go on, tackle.<br> Catch it!<br> Ready.<br> - I'm too old for this game.<br> - Me too.<br> This is the best part.<br> If we stay together, do I have to<br> become Jewish?<br> Of course not. Herbert's not Jewish.<br> I don't mind.<br> Everybody in my family's doing it.<br> There's Luke up there somewhere.<br> You stupid asshole!<br> When I was a kid,<br> he seemed like a god to me.<br> How do you see him now?<br> Like a man...<br> ...with limitations,<br> like the rest of us.<br> Except you, Lowenstein.<br> You're perfect.<br> I am far from it.<br> I look back on my life,<br> and I realize that I've been...<br> ...paralyzed for the last...<br> ...God knows how many years.<br> How could I have stayed<br> in a marriage like that?<br> Well, you had a son.<br> Oh, yeah, there were reasons...<br> ...but none of them good enough.<br> I just never thought...<br> ...that this was possible.<br> And now I...<br> I wake up in the morning,<br> and I spend my whole day thinking...<br> ..."Isn't it nice just to feel good?"<br> I hear you walk down the hall<br> towards me...<br> ...I can't stop smiling.<br> I smile all the time.<br> I love you, Lowenstein.<br> Can we go back to the cabin<br> and make love all night?<br> You still have a lot to learn<br> about the outdoors.<br> I'm glad you brought me here.<br> Lowenstein says she's gonna<br> let you go home soon.<br> I think I'm ready.<br> What about you?<br> When are you going home?<br> I don't know. Sally and I<br> are having problems.<br> Oh, no. I'm sorry, Tom.<br> I thought I might stay here<br> for a while.<br> You, in New York?<br> I can't imagine that.<br> - You could never leave the South.<br> - Well, you did.<br> Yeah, but I don't love it<br> the way you do.<br> Oh, hi, Sal.<br> She called you.<br> We knew this day would come,<br> didn't we?<br> But you're never quite...<br> ...prepared for it.<br> Just hold me, please.<br> I feel like I'm dying.<br> One of the things<br> I love about you...<br> ...is that you're the kind of guy<br> who'll always go back to his family.<br> I gotta find me a nice Jewish boy.<br> You guys are killing me.<br> You okay about going home?<br> I think so.<br> Good.<br> I started a new book of poems.<br> Oh, good.<br> I'm calling it:<br> The Prince of Tides.<br> And I dedicated it to somebody<br> very special.<br> Luke would appreciate that,<br> Savannah.<br> I dedicated it:<br> "To my brother Tom Wingo.<br> My memory. "<br> Oh, thank you, sweetheart.<br> Thank you.<br> Lowenstein, why are you<br> making it so hard?<br> You just love her more.<br> Admit it.<br> No, Lowenstein.<br> Just longer.<br> We spent our last few hours together<br> at the Rainbow Room...<br> ... dancing a slow dance.<br> Just like in my dream.<br> I held her in my arms...<br> ... as I told her that it was her doing<br> that I could go back.<br> Six weeks before, I was ready to leave<br> my wife, my kids.<br> I wanted out of everything.<br> But she changed that.<br> She changed me.<br> For the first time, I felt<br> I had something to give back...<br> ... to the women in my life.<br> They deserved that.<br> - Daddy!<br> - Daddy's home!<br> Daddy, did you bring me anything?<br> So I returned to my Southern home<br> and my Southern life.<br> It is in the presence of my wife<br> and children...<br> ... that I acknowledge my life,<br> my destiny.<br> I am a teacher...<br> ... a coach...<br> ... and a well-loved man.<br> And it is more than enough.<br> In New York, I learned that I needed<br> to love my mother and father...<br> ... in all their flawed,<br> outrageous humanity.<br> And in families, there are no crimes<br> beyond forgiveness.<br> But it is the mystery of life<br> that sustains me now.<br> And I look to the North...<br> ... and I wish again that there were<br> two lives apportioned to every man...<br> ... and every woman.<br> At the end of every day, I drive<br> through the city of Charleston...<br> ... and as I cross the bridge<br> that'll take me home...<br> ... I feel the words building<br> inside me.<br> I can't stop them or tell you<br> why I say them.<br> But as I reach the top<br> of the bridge...<br> ... these words come to me<br> in a whisper.<br> I say them as prayer.<br> As regret.<br> As praise.<br> I say...<br> ...
