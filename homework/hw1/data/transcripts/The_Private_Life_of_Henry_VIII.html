And you've as good<br> a chance as anyone else...<br> if the king's in one<br> of his merry moods.<br> Oh, I never meant...<br> I never thought...<br> - Didn't you, darling?<br> - [Laughing]<br> Now, ladies, you're not here to quarrel<br> but to get busy with your needles.<br> Now all these A's have got to come out<br> and J's go in.<br> On.<br> That's it.<br> - There you are. Hurry, hurry, ladies.<br> - [Chattering]<br> Anne Boleyn dies this morning.<br> Jane Seymour<br> takes her place tonight.<br> What luck.<br> For which of them?<br> I wonder.<br> [Crowd Chattering]<br> [Chattering Continues]<br> - Here I am, darlings!<br> - Come along. Sit down.<br> Oh, thank you!<br> Oh, poor Anne Boleyn.<br> - I do feel so sorry for her.<br> - [Hammering]<br> Excuse me, madam.<br> Do you mind taking off your hat?<br> We can't see the block.<br> Thank you so much.<br> [Hammering Continues]<br> [Whistling]<br> [Whistling Continues]<br> [Chattering]<br> [Laughing]<br> Anne Boleyn.<br> Was she guilty, do you think?<br> - All her lovers confessed.<br> - Under torture.<br> She was as innocent as you or I.<br> Thanks for the compliment.<br> She dies so that the king<br> may be free to marry Jane Seymour.<br> Yes. That's what they mean<br> when they say, "Chop and change."<br> Oh, don't, girls.<br> It's no jesting matter.<br> [Crowd Chattering]<br> The other mirror, please,<br> Lady Marbury.<br> Will the net hold<br> my hair together when...<br> when my head falls?<br> [Lady Marbury Sobbing]<br> Yes, madam.<br> Isn't it a pity<br> to lose a head like this?<br> Still, they will easily<br> find a nickname for me.<br> Among the queens of England<br> I shall be "Anne sans tete. "<br> That means<br> "Anne who lost her head."<br> Ah.<br> There is a blade for you.<br> Fit for a king.<br> Or in this case, a queen.<br> N'est-ce pas?<br> - Not fit for our queen.<br> - No? Why not?<br> She's an English queen, ain't she?<br> Well, what's wrong<br> with English steel?<br> And come to that, what's wrong<br> with an English headsman?<br> Ah. Meaning yourself?<br> Why not?<br> I was good enough to knock off<br> the queen's five lovers, wasn't I?<br> Why'd they want you?<br> A Frenchman from Calais!<br> [Spits]<br> - I will tell you!<br> - Nol<br> I'm telling you.<br> It's a crying shame...<br> with half the English executioners<br> out of work as it is.<br> And why are they out of work?<br> Because they are only fit to sever<br> the bull necks of their countrymen...<br> with a butcher's cleaver.<br> But a woman's neck,<br> a queen's neck...<br> That calls for finesse,<br> for delicacy...<br> for chivalry.<br> In one word, a Frenchman.<br> I could think of another word.<br> Jane Seymour, of all people.<br> Whatever could the king see in her?<br> Oh, she's very sweet.<br> Yes, but does the king like honey<br> with his milk and water?<br> - [Laughing]<br> - Listen!<br> - Wasn't that the gun?<br> - What gun?<br> Will there be a gun fired?<br> When Anne Boleyn's head falls,<br> a gun is to be fired from the tower...<br> another from Westminster,<br> and a third from Richmond...<br> so that the king may know<br> the moment he's free to marry Jane.<br> What a pretty arrangement. The joint<br> goes out, and bang... the sweets come in.<br> - Oh, Katherine!<br> - Oh, well, if the king were not a king,<br> what would you call him?<br> - What would you call him?<br> - I'll tell you.<br> No. Tell me.<br> If I were not a king, what then?<br> All right, ladies.<br> Come here!<br> Look at me.<br> What would you call me?<br> I should call you,<br> Your Majesty...<br> a man.<br> Ha! So I am and glad of it.<br> [Laughing]<br> And you may be glad of it, too,<br> one day.<br> Blushing?<br> She must be new to the court.<br> - What's your name, wench?<br> - Katherine Howard.<br> If it please Your Majesty.<br> It does, Katherine!<br> It does.<br> [Crowd Chattering]<br> - What's that noise?<br> - The crowd, madam.<br> Just like my wedding day.<br> [Rhythmic Tapping]<br> Cromwell, if England were as rich as Portugal<br> or as big as Spain, you might be right.<br> But this little island of three million souls<br> is no match for all Europe.<br> - All Europe?<br> - Yes!<br> If those French and Germans<br> stop cutting each other's throats,<br> what's to stop them cutting ours?<br> A wise diplomacy, sire.<br> Diplomacy!<br> Diplomacy, me foot!<br> I'm an Englishman.<br> I can't say one thing and mean another.<br> What I can do is to build ships,<br> ships and then more ships.<br> - You mean, double the fleet?<br> - Triple it!<br> Fortify Dover.<br> Rule the sea.<br> To do this will cost us money, sire.<br> To leave it undone<br> will cost us England.<br> - [Murmuring]<br> - [Bell OPealing]<br> Thomas Culpeper!<br> Will you see<br> what's become of the queen?<br> A gun will be fired<br> from the tower, Your Majesty.<br> Yes! I did not mean...<br> Will you see<br> if the Lady Jane is ready?<br> - And now the headdress, madam.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Now, which one shall I wear?<br> The velvet coif or the pearl chaplet?<br> - Oh, the chaplet. Wear the chaplet.<br> - [All Chattering]<br> [Knocking]<br> The king wishes to know<br> whether you are ready, madam.<br> Oh, but I don't know<br> whether to wear the pearls or the...<br> Oh, of course.<br> I'll ask the king.<br> [Henry] With a strong port in Dover<br> and a strong fleet in the channel...<br> we can laugh in their faces.<br> But it's the moneyl The moneyl<br> We must have the...<br> Henry!<br> Softly, sweetheart.<br> We have affairs of state here.<br> Oh, but, darling...<br> this is really important.<br> Henry. Henry, which one<br> shall I wear?<br> My Lord Archbishop,<br> will you await us in the chapel?<br> Henry.<br> You haven't said a word<br> about my wedding dress.<br> Don't you love it?<br> Twenty-one little buttons.<br> One for every year of my life.<br> [Laughing]<br> [Jane Laughing]<br> - Don't you love the back?<br> - The back? Marvelous!<br> [Jane Laughing]<br> Do be serious. Which of these?<br> Pearls for a pearl. Now run along,<br> my sweet, and put them on.<br> The bishop waits.<br> Thomas, me hat!<br> [Footsteps Approaching]<br> Is it... time?<br> I was told that the executioner<br> was very good.<br> He is very good.<br> It does not hurt, madam.<br> It's all over in a second.<br> And I have such a little neck.<br> Haven't I?<br> Well, Thomas.<br> What do you think of the new queen?<br> - Wonderful, Your Majesty.<br> - Beautiful?<br> - Lovely.<br> - Clever too?<br> A miracle of good sense,<br> Your Majesty.<br> Liar.<br> [Laughing]<br> No, Thomas.<br> Not clever, thanks be to heaven.<br> My first wife was clever.<br> My second was ambitious. My third...<br> Thomas, if you want to be happy,<br> marry a girl like my sweet little Jane.<br> Marry a stupid woman.<br> [Women Crying]<br> [Drumroll Continues]<br> [Drumroll Stops]<br> What a lovely day.<br> What a lovely day.<br> [Single Loud Drumbeat]<br> Well, one must admit,<br> she died like a queen.<br> Yes. And that frock.<br> Wasn't it too divine?<br> - Was it? I didn't notice.<br> - No, you wouldn't.<br> You wouldn't notice that I haven't<br> had a new gown for a year.<br> All right. All right.<br> You shall have one... for your execution.<br> What...<br> [Staff Taps On Ground]<br> [Culpeper] Knights, ladies,<br> gentlemen and gentlewomen.<br> Attend the king, his Royal Highness<br> by the grace of God...<br> Henry Vlll, King of England and France,<br> Lord of Ireland.<br> Jane.<br> [Choir]<br> Ave Maria<br> [Singing In Latin]<br> - Warming pans.<br> - Warming pans.<br> Warming pans.<br> Rosewater.<br> - [Woman] Rosewater.<br> - [Woman #2] Rosewater.<br> Officer?<br> Here.

She's lasted<br> Then he might...<br> might marry her then.<br> - What, Lady Bassett?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, my good Kate.<br> [Laughing]<br> - [Excited Chattering]<br> - [Henry Laughing]<br> The pretty thing. To bring the child<br> out hatless in the sun.<br> Come to me, my love.<br> Love you.<br> Hmm! Have you lost your wits<br> to treat him so?<br> - I never thought, um...<br> - You never thought?<br> What are brains for,<br> except to think?<br> No, no, no.

Unlock the door.<br> - Is that a command?<br> - Yes!<br> - So the king then, not the man.<br> Don't do that.<br> I'm leaving my crown outside.<br> You've left it outside<br> with my reputation, sire.<br> No one saw me, little Katherine,<br> I swear.<br> Can't you forget the king<br> and forget the crown, forget everything?<br> You told me once I was a man, huh?<br> What do you say if I'm not the king?<br> - Get out of my room.<br> - What? Why...<br> That's what I would say<br> if you were not the king.<br> Since you are the king,<br> I expect your command.<br> Command?<br> It's a poor thing to command in love.<br> - In love?
