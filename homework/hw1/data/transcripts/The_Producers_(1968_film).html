Bit of a pervert?<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> How dare you condemn me<br> without knowing all the facts.<br> - Mr. Bialystock, I wasn't condemn...<br> - Shut up!<br> I'm having a rhetorical conversation.<br> - Do you know who I used to be?<br> - Well, yes.

That's right.<br> - That's right.<br> - And might I say, Mr. Bialystock...<br> And please don't take this<br> the wrong way...<br> ...but you're not just a dirty old man.<br> - Thank you.<br> Oh, you're also<br> a great Broadway producer.<br> And there's something about me<br> you should know.<br> When I was a kid...<br> ...I had the good fortune<br> to be taken to Bialy-Hoos of '42.<br> - Oh, Bialy-Hoos.<br> - Yes.<br> And I still have the ticket stub.<br> - Oh, look at that.<br> - Yeah.<br> And ever since,<br> I've had a secret desire...<br> ...to be a Broadway producer.<br> A secret desire, huh?<br> - Kid, can I give you some advice?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Keep it a secret.<br> Do the books, please.<br> Top drawer, to the left.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Will you look at that.<br> That's it, baby!<br> When you got it, flaunt it!

You have 58 seconds left.<br> ...I noticed that in the column...<br> - You're gonna time it?<br> - Time is money.<br> I looked at your books and the<br> columns marked "monies received."<br> - And I can't make the figures work out.<br> - Forty-eight seconds. Hurry.<br> - There's a problem with your figures.<br> - Twenty-eight. Running out of time.<br> - Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.<br> - I cannot...<br> - Fifteen seconds.<br> - I cannot...

Give it to me.<br> Give it to me. Give me the blanket.<br> Give it to me! Give it to me!<br> Here, here, here.<br> Don't panic. Don't panic.<br> Don't panic.<br> I...<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's just that I don't like anyone<br> touching my blue blanket.<br> It's not important,<br> it's a minor compulsion.<br> I can deal with it if I want to.<br> But I've had it ever since I was a baby,<br> and I find it very comforting.<br> I need to lie down for a minute now.<br> They come here. They all come here.<br> How do they find me?<br> Hey, kid. Hey.<br> Look at this.<br> How can I help you?<br> - What's wrong?<br> - You're gonna jump on me.<br> - What?<br> - You're gonna jump on me.<br> I know you're gonna jump on me<br> and squash me like a bug.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - Please, don't jump on me!<br> I'm not gonna jump on you!<br> I'm not gonna jump on you!<br> Get ahold of yourself!<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> Stop! Calm down!<br> Don't touch me! Don't touch me.<br> - What's the matter now?<br> - I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics.<br> I can't stop when I get like this.<br> I can't stop. I'm hysterical.<br> I can see that.<br> All right. All right, calm down.<br> I'm coming, I'm coming.<br> Take it easy.<br> I'm wet!<br> I'm wet.<br> I'm hysterical and I'm wet!<br> I'm in pain.<br> I'm in pain, I'm wet...<br> ...and I'm still hysterical.<br> All right, all right. What can I do?<br> You're getting me hysterical.<br> Move away, you frighten me.<br> - You're too close.<br> - I frighten you?<br> Yes, get over there and stop<br> touching... Move over there! Sit down.<br> I'm sitting, I'm sitting.<br> You still look angry.<br> I'm sorry. How's this?<br> Who's my little accountant?<br> Who's my little accountant?<br> Are you my little accountant?<br> Are you my little accountant?<br> - Are you my little accountant?<br> - I am.<br> Yes, you are.<br> Well, thank you for smiling.<br> That helped a great deal.<br> Well, you know what they say:<br> "Smile and the world smiles<br> with you."<br> This man should be<br> in a straightjacket.<br> - You feeling better?<br> - Oh, yes, I'm fine now. Thank you.<br> - Good.<br> - May I speak to you?<br> Yes, Prince Myshkin.<br> What can we do for you?<br> Well, this is hardly<br> the time for levity, Mr. Bialystock.<br> I've discovered a serious error...<br> ...in the accounts of your last show,<br> Funny Boy.<br> - Where? What?<br> - Well, according to the backers list...<br> ...you raised $100,000.<br> But your show only cost 98,000.<br> There's 2000 unaccounted for.<br> I went to a Turkish bath.<br> Who cares?<br> The show was a flop.<br> Bloom, do me a favour...<br> ...move a few decimal points around.<br> You can do it, you're an accountant.<br> You're part of a noble profession.<br> The word "count" is part of your title.<br> - That's cheating.<br> - It's not cheating.<br> It's charity.<br> Bloom...<br> ...you see this stickpin?<br> This once held a pearl<br> as big as your eye.<br> I used to wear handmade<br> Italian shoes, $500 suits.<br> And look at me now.<br> Look at me now!<br> I'm wearing a cardboard belt.<br> Bloom, you gotta save me.<br> I'm reaching out to you.<br> Don't send me to prison.<br> Help me.<br> All right. All right.<br> Okay, I'll do it.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes, I'll do it.<br> See, $2000 isn't so much.<br> I'm sure I can hide it someplace.<br> After all, the IRS isn't interested<br> in a show that flopped.<br> Right. Good thinking.<br> You figure it out.<br> I'm gonna take a little nap.<br> Now, let's see.<br> Let's see, if we add up<br> these deductions, we get...<br> Carry the three, divide by four...<br> Amazing.<br> It's absolutely amazing, but...<br> ...under the right circumstances...<br> ...a producer could<br> make more money with a flop...<br> ...than he could with a hit.<br> Yes, it's quite possible. If he were<br> certain that a show would fail...<br> ...a man could make a fortune.<br> - Yes?<br> - Yes, what?<br> - What you were saying. Keep talking.<br> - What was I saying?<br> You were saying that a producer...<br> ...could make more money<br> with a flop than a hit.<br> Well, yes. It's quite possible.<br> You keep saying that,<br> but you don't say how.<br> Well, it's simply a matter<br> of creative accounting.<br> Let's assume for a moment<br> that you are a dishonest man.<br> Assume away.<br> All right. When you produced<br> your last show, Funny Boy...<br> ...you raised $2000<br> more than you needed.<br> But you could've raised a million...<br> ...put on your $100,000 flop<br> and kept the rest.<br> - But what if my show was a hit?<br> - Then you would go to jail.<br> See, rather than 100 percent<br> of the show...<br> ...you would've sold<br> more than 1000 percent.<br> So if the show's a success,<br> there's no way to pay off the backers.<br> - Get it?<br> - Got it.<br> So in order for our scheme to work,<br> we'd have to find a sure- fire flop.<br> "Our scheme"? What scheme?<br> What scheme?<br> Your scheme,<br> you bloody little genius.<br> I meant no scheme. I merely posed<br> a little academic accounting theory.<br> - It was just a thought.<br> - Bloom...<br> ...worlds are turned<br> on such thoughts.<br> Don't you see, Bloom?<br> Darling Bloom, glorious Bloom.<br> It's so simple.<br> Step one,<br> we find the worst play ever written.<br> Step two,<br> we hire the worst director in town.<br> - Step three, I raise 2 million dollars.<br> - Two?<br> Yes, one for me, one for you. There's<br> a lot of little old ladies out there.<br> Step four, we hire the worst actors<br> in New York and open on Broadway.<br> And before you can say "step five,"<br> we close on Broadway...<br> ...take our 2 million and go to Rio.<br> Rio? That'd never work.<br> Oh, ye of little faith.<br> What did Lewis say to Clark<br> When everything look ed bleak?<br> What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing<br> As they struggled<br> Toward Everest's peak?<br> What did Washington say<br> To his troops<br> As they crossed the Delaware?<br> I'm sure you're well aware<br> What'd they say?<br> We can do it<br> We can do it<br> We can do it<br> Me and you<br> We can do it<br> We can do it<br> We can make our dreams come true<br> Everything you've ever wanted<br> Is just waiting to be had<br> Beautiful girls<br> Wearing nothing but pearls<br> Caressing you, undressing you<br> And driving you mad<br> No.<br> Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute, now.<br> Hear me out.
