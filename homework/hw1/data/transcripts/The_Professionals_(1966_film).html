Grant?<br> He needs you. Urgent.<br> My husband.<br> Hurry. Hurry.<br> Please, hurry.<br> Get out of here.<br> Baby!<br> It's nice to see you.<br> I'm Joe Grant.<br> Thank you for coming, Mr. Ehrengard.<br> Got your telegram, Mr. Grant.<br> It's a pleasure, Mr. Sharp.<br> Yeah. Me too, Lizzie.<br> Mr. Grant, l'm your local<br> bank representative.<br> As per your instructions,<br> this box contains....<br> Thank you for coming, Mr. Fardan.<br> The receipt, Mr. Grant.<br> Exactly $1 00,000 in gold coins.<br> Not a coin larger than $50.<br> That's quite an unusual request.<br> Thank you. Move out.<br> Mr. Grant. Slow freight ahead.<br> -Sidetrack it.<br> -You should count the money.<br> -Didn't you count it?<br> -Well, yes, of course, but....<br> Thank you.<br> Henry "Rico" Fardan. Virginia Military<br> Academy, Philippine campaign...<br> ...Cuba with Roosevelt's Rough<br> Riders. Married a Mexican woman.<br> No children. Wife deceased.<br> Joined Pancho Villa<br> as weapons expert and tactician.<br> Your hair was darker then.<br> My heart was lighter then.<br> Left Villa's forces, June, 1 91 5.<br> A year of wildcatting and prospecting.<br> Results: negative.<br> Now demonstrating automatic<br> weapons. Salary: $40 a week.<br> Hans Ehrengard. Ex-cavalryman,<br> cattle boss, wrangler...<br> ...bull-whacker, packmaster.<br> Jacob Sharp. Specialist with rifle,<br> rope and longbow.<br> Most dependable scout and tracker<br> in the territory.<br> Any objections to working<br> with a Negro?<br> What's the job, Mr. Grant?<br> How well do you know him?<br> -Well enough.<br> -What's your feeling toward him?<br> I have the highest respect for him...<br> ...as a soldier.<br> Last week, your respected soldier<br> kidnapped my wife.<br> His ransom note.<br> Your job:<br> A mission of mercy.<br> Raza. Captain Jesus Raza.<br> Jesus.<br> What a name for the bloodiest<br> cutthroat in Mexico.<br> Mrs. Grant is a prisoner<br> about 1 00 miles across this desert.<br> A hellhole. For Raza, a fortress.<br> He was born in that desert.<br> He and his men know every ravine,<br> every rock, every cliff.<br> It'd take a battalion at least a month.<br> But a few daring men...<br> ...specialists, led by you...<br> ...could do it in one bold, swift stroke.<br> Why not? You're fluent in Spanish.<br> You know the terrain.<br> You know Raza.<br> How he thinks and reacts.<br> -l know you can do it.<br> -l don't think so, Mr. Grant.<br> One thousand dollars a man going in.<br> If you bring her back safe and sound...<br> ...another 9000 dollars<br> for each of you.<br> -How many men does Raza have?<br> -Pasqual?<br> Last month, 1 50, maybe. Now?<br> -lf I were you, l'd pay the ransom.<br> -There it is.<br> One hundred thousand dollars<br> in gold coins, as requested by Raza.<br> Will that guarantee that she<br> won't be killed? You know Raza.<br> Say we were lucky enough<br> to get there.<br> How do we get your wife out? Safely?<br> Gentlemen, l don't know<br> where else to turn.<br> -What we really need is an equalizer.<br> -Name it.<br> A dynamiter with a delicate touch<br> to blow out a candle...<br> -...without denting the candleholder.<br> -Who?<br> Him.<br> Arrange to have that man at the train<br> where we pick up the horses.<br> -Where is he?<br> -Not far.<br> -Get the details.<br> -ln jail.<br> -ln jail?<br> -He says that $700 will bail him out.<br> But is he dependable?<br> Can he be trusted?<br> I trust him.<br> Then you've got him.<br> -Rico, buddy, l don't deserve you.<br> -l agree.<br> I can understand you getting<br> into a crap game and losing $700...<br> -...but how'd you lose your pants?<br> -ln a lady's bedroom.<br> Trying to raise the cash.<br> Almost had it made too.<br> You realise people are the only<br> animals who make love face to face?<br> He's all yours.<br> Thanks. Again.<br> You could have telegraphed<br> the money yesterday.<br> Yesterday, I didn't have the money.<br> What's the proposition?<br> You won't lose your pants.<br> Your life, maybe, but...what's that?<br> Hardly anything at all.<br> -Well?<br> -Nice animals.<br> -Picked by Mr. Ortega.<br> -You can depend on them.<br> This one is Mrs. Grant's favourite.<br> Bred for speed.<br> He'll need a lot more than that<br> for this job.<br> -You'll have to make them do.<br> -Mr. Grant...<br> ...l can make them go,<br> but I can't make them do.<br> $1 00,000 for a wife?<br> She must be a lot of woman.<br> Certain women have a way<br> of changing some boys into men...<br> -...and some men back into boys.<br> -That's a woman worth saving.<br> -Where are we going?<br> -The Painted Mountains.<br> That's right.<br> -You want us to go back to Mexico?<br> -This time strictly for cash.<br> -What's the deal?<br> -$1 0,000 per man, for nine days' work.<br> More money than we ever realised<br> out of all our schemes put together.<br> No detours!<br> I made us a contract. All the way.<br> -They know who took the woman?<br> -Raza.<br> Our Raza? A kidnapper?<br> -Grant's got a ransom note to prove it.<br> -Well, l'll be damned.<br> Most of us are.<br> Last week Mrs. Grant went riding.<br> Across the border.<br> She was born in Mexico.<br> I suppose she got lonely for it.<br> By the time we were alarmed,<br> the note of ransom arrived.<br> You'll want to know how she looks.<br> Those were taken four years ago<br> on our wedding day.<br> I guess I'm not much good without her.<br> Not anymore.<br> -What part of the hacienda is she kept?<br> -l'd only be guessing.<br> We have to know.<br> -The goat-keeper must know.<br> -ls he still there?<br> -What goat-keeper?<br> -By name, Padillia. Eduardo Padillia.<br> He was devoted to Mrs. Grant.<br> Twice a day he brought her<br> goat's milk. lt was almost a ritual.<br> By this, he will know<br> you have my blessing.<br> Like myself, he would give his life<br> for the senora.<br> When you cross under that bridge,<br> you're in Mexico.<br> You'll leave as soon as it's dark.<br> It's safer to travel by night, rest by day.<br> Bring her back to me.<br> Please.<br> We've been following<br> the same tracks.<br> -Mexicans.<br> -How many horses?<br> Eight. More likely 1 0.<br> -How long ago?<br> -Couple hours.<br> -Which way they headed?<br> -Same as us, south. Only, circling.<br> Now, why should they circle?<br> Raza's men?<br> -Why not?<br> -This far north?<br> That's a good question.<br> Could be anybody. Even friendly.<br> -Could be.<br> -Jake, shag them. Look them over.<br> But just look.<br> We'll camp at Dead Man's Canyon.<br> Spot us by the Painted Hills.<br> I'll find you.<br> Rico. You know something?<br> Me and Raza are the two<br> most corruptible bums.<br> -We'd do most anything for money.<br> -And have.<br> But not kidnapping.<br> That's not our trade.<br> Why did Raza pick Grant's wife<br> to kidnap?<br> Company. Eight.<br> Next bend up ahead.<br> -Last night you saw tracks for 1 0.<br> -That's right.<br> -Any cover?<br> -Both sides.<br> Cut out your two horses<br> and the dynamite mule.<br> -Maybe they're just passing.<br> -lf so, they'll ride in single file.<br> The leader in front, and they'll palaver.<br> If it's trouble, they'll come as a group.<br> If the leader takes his hat off and<br> passes it across to cover his gun...<br> ...let go, fast.<br> -Bill, you take the point.<br> -They got bolt-action rifles.<br> -Same setup as Durango?<br> -Yeah. Why not?<br> -They're here.<br> -They're here.<br> Good morning, friends.<br> Good morning.<br> They're Americans.<br> -You got lost?<br> -Just looking for a place to camp.<br> What you got in those packs, boss?<br> Gold?<br> You got more gold in your teeth.<br> He says I've got more gold<br> in my teeth. How funny!<br> -lt's very dangerous around here.<br> -Oh, that so?<br> Sure. Many bandits<br> hide in these mountains.<br> Very bad men.<br> They steal from anybody.<br> -Especially gringos.<br> -ln that case, we'd better keep moving.<br> Go with God.<br> -That makes 1 0.<br> -That's right.<br> Shoot the horse. Shoot him!<br> -Bury them deep.<br> -Nine more of their horses are still left.<br> -You gonna shoot them too?<br> -We can't spare the food and water.<br> You can turn them loose.<br> -What's so funny?<br> -People.<br> We just killed 1 0 men.<br> Nobody bats an eye.<br> -When it comes to a stupid animal....<br> -But harmless.<br> Nothing's harmless in the desert,<br> unless it's dead.<br> Want to face another pack<br> of Raza's men?<br> -They'll head south, to camp.<br> -They'll head to the river, north.<br> Suppose they follow us? What then?<br> Then shoot them.<br> All right. Cut them loose.<br> God almighty.<br> I've known heat before, but this is....<br> I hate the desert.<br> It's got no pity.<br> Jake.<br> -Did he take his salt?<br> -l'll see that he gets some.<br> Let him sleep. You too.<br> How they taking it?<br> They'll be all right.<br> You'd better scout ahead tonight.<br> Now, beyond that ridge,<br> 20 miles of salt flats.<br> Then 1 0 more of sand.<br> 220 degrees south by southwest.<br> Our next layover, Coyote Pass.<br> The cemetery of nameless men.<br> We buried some fine friends there.<br> And some fine enemies.<br> That was a fine battle.<br> Outnumbered, outgunned,<br> and still we held that pass.<br> Yeah, but who cares now?<br> Or even remembers?<br> Now, take that ruckus this morning.<br> A year ago, those men would be<br> fighting federals instead of gringos.<br> -We were lucky.<br> -We were also stiffed.<br> They had us spotted back<br> where we picked up their trail.<br> -Why did they sucker us into this spot?<br> -You're leery about the setup too. So?<br> Amigo, three days' ride from<br> Coyote Pass is another graveyard.<br> But instead of dead heroes,<br> they buried gold bullion.<br> Two million in Spanish gold.<br> Melted down into beautiful bars.<br> Waiting for us.<br> We don't have to fight Raza to get it.<br> -lt's not the reason you took this job.<br> -Got a better reason?<br> Our word. We gave our word<br> to bring the woman back.<br> My word to Grant<br> ain't worth a plugged nickel.<br> You gave your word to me.<br> Drink?<br> Thanks.<br> Yeah, takes getting used to.<br> Broiling by day. Freezing at night.<br> Alkali dust choking your body.<br> Who lives here long enough<br> to get used to it?<br> Men, tempered like steel,<br> a tough breed.<br> Men who've learned how to endure.<br> -Like you and Dolworth.<br> -Oh, no.<br> Men like Raza.<br> I wonder how long that's been there.<br> About an hour or so.<br> Dolworth put it there.<br> That means everything's all clear.<br> An upside-down cross means danger.<br> -Could've been put there by anybody.<br> -That's the idea.<br> Good morning, friend.<br> -Dolworth?<br> -Yeah.<br> -How many more?<br> -Three.<br> No guns.<br> -We that close to Raza?<br> -Could be.<br> At least l made out with a fine pistol.<br> We sure got lucky with this gringo, eh?<br> No wonder my mother kicked me<br> out of the house!<br> -A bottle.<br> -You'd even frighten the dead!<br> Don't get carried away.<br> The bottle.<br> Where are your friends, amigo?<br> Here have a drink.<br> These shoes will be mine if they fit.<br> -Hey, don't l know you?<br> -Well, from here you look like me.<br> -Why you come to this place?<br> -You'll laugh.<br> It is not proper to laugh at a man<br> who is about to die.<br> I came because l'm crazy<br> about your tequila.<br> And l like your women.<br> See? You laugh.<br> What a funny guy, huh?<br> I'm gonna ask again.<br> Where are your friends?<br> I told you. I always travel alone.<br> It is a sacrilege to die<br> with a lie in your teeth.<br> See?<br> Those horses and six more<br> come back to us.<br> But where are the men<br> who ride them?<br> I don't think you kill 1 0 men<br> by yourself, buddy.<br> Hold it!<br> Stop!<br> I wouldn't do that.<br> My friend would die of a terrible<br> headache. And so would you.<br> And so would you.<br> So wouldn't it be more sensible<br> if we both kept our heads, huh?<br> Put down your gun.<br> If l did that, how do l know<br> that you would still be friendly?<br> Do I gotta kill you<br> to prove I like you?<br> Your gun, mister.<br> That's why I like this fool,<br> because he's intelligent.<br> -Behave!<br> -Behave. Let it drop.<br> That's why I like this one,<br> because he's so intelligent.<br> Thattaboy.<br> Come on, buddy.<br> Let it go already.<br> He's a good man after all.<br> You have to get over this habit<br> of losing your pants.<br> -lt's not dignified.<br> -lt's draughty too.<br> -Don't worry. This time I'll do it.<br> -This time we need them.<br> You all right?<br> Makes you wonder<br> how we ever beat the lndians.<br> Thanks.<br> Interesting pass.<br> You should see it from upside down.<br> If we hightail it out of here in a hurry,<br> that doorway could save us hours.<br> It's the same shortcut for Raza.<br> Not if you rig it<br> so we slam that door in his face.<br> Yeah?<br> I'll take the first watch.<br> If it isn't hot, it's cold.<br> If it isn't cold, it's raining.<br> How bad is that horse?<br> -Not too good. No bottom.<br> -We could all do with a rest.<br> Yeah.<br> -A shave would be a relief.<br> -So would a bath.<br> Might as well throw in a woman.<br> Any size, any age, any colour.<br> Any woman.<br> Mr. D...<br> ...whatever got a loving man like you<br> in the dynamite business?<br> I'll tell you.

Ours.<br> If we're lucky...<br> ...and get back to this rattrap,<br> it'll be touch-and-go.<br> All you gotta do is light this fuse.<br> You got 1 0 seconds to run like hell.<br> And then dynamite, not faith,<br> will move that mountain into this pass.<br> Peace, brother.<br> That track is the main line<br> to Mexico City.<br> According to this, Grant's railroad spur<br> branches off three miles up.<br> Beyond those hills...the hacienda.<br> Supply train.<br> -Government troops.<br> -Well, look here.<br> Raza.<br> Throw it!<br> Pull it!<br> -How are you, man?<br> -Good, chief. Thank you.<br> -Are they all Reds?<br> -Yes, Captain, they all are.<br> Well, you know what to do.<br> -Justice.<br> -Shut up!<br> The men on that train are Colorados.<br> Expert marksmen.<br> Also expert at torture.<br> Years ago, they burned and looted<br> a town of 3000 people.<br> When they finished, 40 were left.<br> Fardan's wife was one of the lucky 40.<br> "Why are you a revolutionary?"<br> they asked her.<br> "To rid the world of scum like you,"<br> she said.<br> They stripped her naked...<br> ...ran her through the cactus<br> until her flesh was....<br> The other 39 rebels<br> watched her die...<br> ...and did nothing.<br> Just watched.<br> What were Americans<br> doing in a Mexican revolution?<br> Maybe there's only one revolution,<br> since the beginning.<br> The good guys against the bad guys.<br> The question is:<br> Who are the good guys?<br> -Juanito, to the north and south, okay?<br> -Got it.<br> About 60 horses, four burros.<br> Two machine guns from the train.<br> Jake.<br> Keep those horses quiet.<br> Get some more from the other side.<br> Hurry.<br> You rode well today, honey.<br> Perfectly.<br> Beautiful.<br> -That Mrs. Grant?<br> -That is a soldier.<br> Lieutenant Si Si Chiquita.<br> Now, there's a woman worth a ransom.<br> She never says no.<br> Before you blow a gasket,<br> think you can blow the water tower?<br> -How do you want it?<br> -Like it was hit with a French 75.<br> Mrs. Grant could be there.<br> -Seems the only likely place.<br> -The trouble is, we gotta be dead sure.<br> When we make our move,<br> there won't be time for guessing.<br> Coming through the gate.<br> -Morning. How's the wife and kids?<br> -Very good, very good.<br> Wow, there's a lot of you here.<br> Anybody see any cows?<br> No.<br> It's a cinch that milk didn't<br> come from the breast of a tin can.<br> Our friend, the goat-keeper.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> -What is your name?<br> -Eduardo Padillia, at your service.<br> Do you recognise this?<br> Friends of Mr. Ortega.<br> That's right.<br> The milk that you brought<br> to the hacienda this morning....<br> Who was that for?<br> -Who drinks it?<br> -Many people.<br> Anybody special?<br> The lady. Senora Grant.<br> She live in that room? You're sure?<br> -You have seen her?<br> -l know her from when she was born.<br> Her mother was dry. She was raised<br> on the milk of my goats.<br> -ls she well?<br> -Very well, considering.<br> We have come to help her.<br> Blessed be the Lord.<br> May God repay you. May God--<br> Raza has to expect one of two things:<br> A messenger with a ransom...<br> ...or an attack from the federales.<br> We've gotta make him think<br> we're the Mexican army.<br> -The four of us?<br> -A whole battalion.<br> Now, how do the federales<br> start an attack? Artillery.<br> This is our battery of field guns.<br> First you hit him here. French 75s.<br> Then here, here, here.<br> Carefully avoiding Mrs. Grant.<br> -When they run to defend the--<br> -We rescue Little Red Riding Hood.<br> We can't fight our way in.<br> Diversion is our only chance.<br> Well?<br> Rico, buddy, I got one of my feelings.<br> Something's dicey about this.<br> Let's pull out.<br> If you can deliver this dynamite<br> with split-second timing...<br> ...we can pull this job off.<br> Mr. D?<br> I guess we just gotta get lucky.<br> Jacob, this stick of dynamite<br> weighs exactly four ounces.<br> If you taped that to an arrow,<br> how far could you shoot it?<br> And hit the mark.<br> I don't like it.<br> -We get it wrong?<br> -Relax.<br> The stuff you're handling is safe.<br> These beaded sticks are trickier.<br> It's the heat.<br> Makes them sweat. Nitro.<br> When they're dry and cool,<br> they're safe and obedient.<br> We'll leave these sweaty ones behind.<br> Ventilate them. Cool them.<br> Then maybe they'll behave.<br> I don't know whether it's me<br> or the dynamite...<br> ...that's doing all that sweating.<br> Four men against so many.<br> How will you save the senora?<br> -l don't know yet.<br> -When will it happen?<br> -Tomorrow. Maybe the next day.<br> -Not before?<br> -There's much to prepare.<br> -Speak plainly, senor.<br> Am l your prisoner?<br> I want to help the senora.<br> But you make me feel unworthy.<br> Trouble!<br> Show us if you're worthy.<br> Go greet them.<br> And remember,<br> I speak your language.<br> They don't give good milk<br> if they're skinny.<br> What happened, old man?<br> Any news?<br> -Talk!<br> -Same as always. Very hot weather.<br> -Have you seen anyone around here?<br> -No.<br> A gringo maybe?<br> -Gringo?<br> -Yeah, a gringo.<br> Are you sure?<br> They killed and buried ten of our men.<br> They found the men<br> we buried in the canyon.<br> Am l worthy?<br> If l were you, Jacob, I wouldn't use<br> any of these for firewood.<br> Excuse me. I am ready to leave.<br> -Shall I tell the senora of your coming?<br> -No.<br> -She might behave differently.<br> -l understand.<br> By tomorrow, God willing,<br> the senora will be safe.<br> Until later, then.<br> So you let him go.<br> They expect him to bring the milk.<br> To hell with the milk.<br> -What must he do to prove himself?<br> -He proved nothing.<br> He knew if he said a wrong word,<br> he'd be shot.<br> What were we to do?<br> Watch him all night, and tomorrow?<br> When we go do the job, then what?<br> We take him with us? Tie him up?<br> Or were you planning killing him?<br> I wouldn't put that past you.<br> -l don't like it.<br> -All right.<br> We do the job tonight, as planned.<br> This fuse burns for 1 0 seconds.<br> Three seconds for flight of arrow?<br> -About.<br> -Once you light the fuse...<br> -...you've got seven seconds to shoot.<br> -Clear.<br> Start shooting<br> as soon as the water tower blows.<br> These are your targets.<br> That's your position.<br> -l have 4:1 7.<br> -4:20.<br> -4:24.<br> -Set them at 4:30.<br> We should have an hour before dawn.<br> How much time do you need?<br> I'll be ready by 5:00. This fuse<br> will burn for half-hour exactly.<br> -Fireworks start at 5:30 sharp.<br> -Any questions?<br> -Machine gun over the lady's room?<br> -My job. Anything else?<br> Let's go to work.<br> Listen to me!<br> -Who are you looking for?<br> -Raza.<br> There are things that--<br> Captain.<br> What?<br> Carlos, l won't take long.<br> I know.<br> -How was it?<br> -Okay.<br> -Carlos?<br> -Yeah?<br> -Want some tequila?<br> -Oh, good. Thank you, friend.<br> Where are you all going?<br> I'm right here.<br> Good night.<br> -See the woman?<br> -Yes.<br> -Talk to her yet?<br> -No.<br> -How much time we got?<br> -About eight minutes.<br> -Listen to me!<br> -Go on.<br> -Go to hell!<br> -You go to hell!<br> I don't give a shit!<br> That Chiquita,<br> she can lick a whole regiment...<br> ...but she can't dance a lick.<br> You. Go away!<br> Amigo, we've been had.<br> Let's get the hell out of here.<br> -No.<br> -No!<br> Do exactly as l said.<br> The Mrs.<br> Speak only what l told you.<br> Nothing more, nothing less.<br> Call them.<br> Rico. All clear.<br> By the way, l forgot to bring<br> your wooden cross...<br> ...your upside-down cross.<br> Cease fire!<br> Cease fire!<br> You're going to injure the Mrs.<br> -Cease fire!<br> -Cease fire!<br> They're afraid to hit the woman.<br> Your position is hopeless.<br> Put down your weapons.<br> Get up.<br> Come on, baby. Let's go.<br> Don't shoot.<br> Release the woman!<br> Release her!<br> Shoot.<br> Do as l say.<br> Shoot.<br> One shot from you, l'll kill her.<br> Get your men off that train.<br> Move!<br> Now!<br> Let's go! Outside.<br> Three against four. What happened?<br> -Feels like a busted rib.<br> -You're lucky.<br> The bullet went clean through.<br> Your hands are filthy.<br> What's it to you if he lives or dies?<br> If he lives, we'll have to slow down.<br> That'll give Raza<br> a chance to catch up.<br> She'll work to keep him alive,<br> all right.<br> Yes?<br> Just wondering.<br> What makes you worth<br> $1 00,000?<br> Go to hell.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I'm on my way.<br> Thanks.<br> How is he?<br> He will never reach the border.<br> None of you.<br> You have no chance. You never did.<br> We knew everything.<br> From the moment you set foot<br> in Mexico. Even before.<br> From the day<br> my husband sent for you.<br> Mr. Ortega.<br> He said he would<br> give his life for you.<br> For me, not my husband.<br> For Raza. For the revolution.<br> From the loyal Ortega to the devoted<br> goat-keeper, to the faithful wife...<br> ...at the mercy of a brutal kidnapper.<br> That's one hell of a rigged parlay.<br> I was not kidnapped.<br> The old badger game.<br> Shakedown partners, bed partners.<br> Cosy.<br> Raza and I grew up together.<br> I am born there.<br> When it's the hacienda of my father,<br> when Raza is only a stable boy.<br> We are lovers long before<br> Mr. Joe Grant buys the place.<br> When my father lies dying, he says:<br> "Mr. Joe Grant wants you<br> for his wife."<br> "You will become Dona Grant,<br> a fine lady. That is my wish."<br> Here, a wish is a command.<br> But l'm very young and very foolish.<br> I tell Mr. Joe Grant<br> I cannot marry to him.<br> I love another man.<br> Very romantic, no?<br> Your husband sent you clothes.<br> I offer you a better bargain than l got.<br> Four lives. Yours, if you let me go.<br> You better change<br> before we start back.<br> It'll be a long ride<br> on your bare bottom.<br> Raza!<br> -How much time have we got?<br> -None.<br> Get her out. Get her out!<br> Mario!<br> Drink it.<br> See anything?<br> Sand.<br> They'll be along.<br> -How would they know which way?<br> -Raza will know.<br> You should have let me finish him.<br> Why didn't you kill him?<br> You let Raza live.<br> Why?<br> Shall l tell you?<br> You are simpatico. No man was more<br> loyal to the revolution than you.<br> I fought like any other man.<br> Loyalty such as yours, that comes<br> only from devotion to a cause.<br> That same fire burns in Raza. That is<br> why you could not see him murdered.<br> He is a thief, trying to steal<br> 1 00,000 dollars.<br> You are a whore<br> cheating on your husband.<br> My husband stole millions<br> from this land, our land.<br> If we can keep the revolution alive,<br> with that money, for just a day...<br> ...then l'll steal and cheat,<br> and whore...<br> ...and anything else<br> that must be done.<br> You laugh. But you believed<br> in the revolution once.<br> What else inspired you<br> to fight for us?<br> Well, ma'am, l'll tell you.<br> I got inspired one day<br> in May, 1 91 1 , in El Paso.<br> It started suddenly. Shooting, yelling,<br> bombs going across the Rio Grande.<br> Everybody ran to see what<br> the ruckus was about. Me too.<br> From the top of freight cars<br> we saw across the river.<br> The Maderistas were taking Juarez.<br> The revolution had busted wide open.<br> It was beautiful.<br> The next thing l know I was<br> across the border shooting...<br> ...with everybody and yelling,<br> "Viva Mexico."<br> A month later l was<br> blowing up trains for Villa.<br> Yes?<br> That's it.<br> Nothing more?<br> Not even money?<br> Promised, never paid.<br> But you stayed. You and this one.<br> And fought for six years,<br> the worst years.<br> It's not our war anymore, Mrs. Grant.<br> Him, I understand.<br> An adventurer without principles.<br> But you?<br> Change your clothes.<br> We're leaving.<br> Raza says you<br> and he were good friends.<br> -That's right.<br> -And yet, you would have killed him.<br> That's right.<br> For money.<br> That's right.<br> For as much money,<br> would you let me go?<br> -How long since you had a woman?<br> -Too long.<br> You want me?<br> My price is high.<br> Freedom.<br> I might say yes now<br> and later, no.<br> I trust you.<br> I trust you too.<br> You heard the man. We're leaving.<br> Finished.<br> Try a little salt, ma'am.<br> Make you feel better.<br> Ma'am....<br> Sorry about your horse, ma'am.<br> -You know something, Rico?<br> -Here.<br> That's a lot of woman there.<br> Beautiful. Classy. And guts.<br> Hard enough to kill you,<br> and soft enough to change you.<br> Reminds me of another Maria.<br> Yours.<br> Amigo, don't con me.<br> She's going back. lf I have<br> to do it alone, she's going back.<br> That's what l wanted to hear you say.<br> What is on your mind besides<br> 1 00-proof women, 90-proof whisky...<br> ...and 14-carat gold?<br> Amigo...<br> ...you just wrote my epitaph.<br> -How many men?<br> -Raza and six. Pushing hard.<br> Moving out.<br> To make the border,<br> we gotta be out in three hours.<br> We got an hour, maybe less.<br> You have lost.<br> Win or lose, here and now.<br> Bottleneck like this,<br> one of us might hold them off.<br> -One of us.<br> -lf he plays it cool.<br> Hit and run. Stall and retreat.<br> Ehrengard needs help.<br> That's Jake's job.<br> The woman has to be watched.<br> That's your job.<br> -Buying the time we need is my job.<br> -Whoa, amigo. Slow down.<br> Let's keep this professional. Your job<br> is to make good our contract.<br> To deliver the goods. All the way.<br> That's your job.<br> I got 9000 bucks coming.<br> In hard cash, please.<br> Take my horse.<br> You'll need him if Raza gets past me.<br> Bill.<br> See you.<br> Jake.<br> How are you going to make it back?<br> Well, how were you?<br> No!<br> Come on! Go on!<br> Sons of bitches.<br> Show your faces, bastards.<br> -Fierro!<br> -l got one of them.<br> Francisco!<br> Where are they?<br> Speak, man. Their positions!<br> Rico!<br> Fierro, is he finished?<br> Not yet, baby.<br> Baby.<br> Amigo.<br> So you are the one<br> they left to die, huh?<br> Where did the bullet bite you?<br> In the ass.<br> You?<br> Another two inches, mamacita.<br> Could you spare one more cigarro?<br> Why, sure.<br> Come and get it.<br> Hey, Fierro!<br> -You want tobacco?<br> -Smoking is bad for the health.<br> How do you come<br> to this dirty business?<br> The usual.<br> Money.<br> Everything is as usual.<br> I need guns and bullets, as usual.<br> The war goes badly, as usual.<br> Only you...<br> ...you are not as usual.<br> Chiquita!<br> How's your love life?<br> Terrific.<br> You want some?<br> Don't you ever say no?<br> -Never.<br> -Anybody?<br> Everybody!<br> You know, of course,<br> one of us must die.<br> Maybe both of us.<br> To die for money is foolish.<br> To die for a woman is more foolish.<br> Any woman, even her.<br> How long you think to hold us here?<br> Oh, a couple of hours.<br> Then what happens<br> here won't matter.<br> She'll be Mrs. Joe Grant again.<br> But that will change nothing.<br> She is my woman.<br> Before. Now. Always.<br> Nothing is for always.<br> Except death.<br> Ask Fierro. Ask Francisco.<br> Ask those in the<br> cemetery of nameless men.<br> -They died for what they believed.<br> -The revolution?<br> When the shooting stops<br> and the dead buried...<br> ...and the politicians take over, it all<br> adds up to one thing, a lost cause.<br> So....<br> You want perfection or nothing.<br> You're too romantic, compadre.<br> La Revolucion<br> is like a great love affair.<br> In the beginning, she is a goddess.<br> A holy cause. But every<br> love affair has a terrible enemy.<br> Time.<br> We see her as she is.<br> La Revolucion is not a goddess,<br> but a whore.<br> She was never pure,<br> never saintly, never perfect.<br> So we run away.<br> Find another lover, another cause.<br> Quick, sordid affairs.<br> Lust, but no love.<br> Passion, but no compassion.<br> Without love...<br> ...without a cause, we are nothing.<br> We stay because we believe.<br> We leave because<br> we are disillusioned.<br> We come back because we are lost.<br> We die because we are committed.<br> You and I together.<br> I to the front.<br> -l will go first.<br> -Do as I say, woman!<br> A woman he will not shoot.<br> Jesus!<br> Hello, baby.<br> Long time since l hear "baby."<br> Hey, you ever find...<br> ...that damn gold mine?<br> I am not lucky today.<br> But you're beautiful.<br> Querido, baby.<br> We had some fine times together.<br> Terrific.<br> Give us a kiss.<br> Mrs. Grant, let's go.<br> As long as we're<br> not pressed for time.<br> Well, in a few minutes she'll be home.<br> Be nice if Bill<br> was here for the payoff.<br> Be nice if he was here alive.<br> But stalling around won't make it so.<br> A cloud of dust. Could be Mr. Raza.<br> Could be most anything.<br> Even a whirling dervish.<br> That, gentlemen,<br> is the whirlingest dervish of them all.<br> -Never thought he'd get out alive.<br> -And that, gentlemen...<br> ...calls for a celebration.<br> What's that supposed to mean?<br> Rico, buddy, this will come<br> as a shock to both of us.<br> -l'm a born sucker for love.<br> -That bullet knocked your brains out.<br> Or let some in.<br> What happened back there?<br> What changed your mind?<br> I found out what makes a woman<br> worth 1 00,000 dollars.<br> You expect me to turn her loose?<br> Turn her loose? After all we've<br> been through together?<br> After all the blood it's cost?<br> Hell, no!<br> You made a contract to kidnap<br> a wife for Mr. J.W. Grant.<br> Now, let's collect that ransom.<br> Thank you, from the bottom<br> of my heart. Thank you.<br> Nicked you a bit, did they?<br> Help yourself.<br> -l'll get Mrs. Grant.<br> -That isn't necessary.<br> Hooper! Escort these men<br> into town. See they're paid in full.<br> Charge hotel bills, whisky bills,<br> girl bills, all bills. Anything. On me.<br> You must be anxious<br> to get a hot bath...<br> ...so it'll have to be adios<br> and muchas gracias.<br> -A hot bath.<br> -Why? ls it Saturday?<br> You did your job and earned<br> a bust-out. Those are orders.<br> The contract is not complete until...<br> ...Mrs. Grant is delivered<br> safe and sound.<br> -The code of the profession?<br> -Something like that.<br> Very well. I hereby declare<br> our contract satisfactorily concluded.<br> Not yet. Mrs. Grant--<br> Thank you.<br> Maria!<br> -Hooper.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Kill him.<br> No, no.<br> You haven't earned<br> the right to kill him.<br> If it's not too much, l want privacy.<br> -Joseph!<br> -Not now.<br> There is nothing to hide.<br> They know everything.<br> Everything.<br> You're back again.<br> Nothing else matters.<br> I will run away again. That matters.<br> You're my wife. You belong to me.<br> I belong here.<br> -With him?<br> -With him.<br> I'd rather see you dead.<br> You're coming with me!<br> You're going home!<br> -No!<br> -Yes!<br> Gentlemen, you heard our employer.<br> The lady's going home.<br> Did you think J.W. Grant was<br> stupid enough to pay that ransom?<br> Certainly not.<br> There was no kidnapping.<br> Right, Mr. Grant?<br> -Right, Mr. Grant?<br> -That is none of your business.<br> Wrong, Mr. Grant.<br> We made a contract to save<br> a lady from a nasty old kidnapper.<br> Who turns out to be you.<br> We both made a bad deal, Mr. Grant.<br> You lose a wife, and we lose<br> 1 0,000 dollars apiece.<br> You bastard!<br> Yes, sir.<br> In my case, an accident of birth.<br> But you, sir,<br> you're a self-made man.<br>
