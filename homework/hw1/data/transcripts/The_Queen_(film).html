Of course, one forgets that as<br> sovereign, you're not entitled to vote.<br> - No.<br> - Still, I don't feel sorry for you.<br> You might not be allowed to vote,<br> ma'am...<br> ...but it is your government.<br> Yes.<br> I suppose that is some consolation.<br> Good morning.<br> - Shall I draw the curtains?<br> - Yes, please.<br> So, did you stay up all night?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> And was it as expected?<br> Yes, ma'am. Mr Blair.<br> By a landslide.<br> Oh, I see.<br> 'They've stopped the traffic<br> completely<br> 'for Tony Blair's first day of power<br> in London.<br> 'You've got the ceremonial,<br> the official<br> 'and you've got a lovely summer's day.<br> 'Tony Blair waving to the crowds,<br> people waving to them there.<br> 'I guess they know it's<br> the Prime Minister on the streets.'<br> The Prime Minister is on his way,<br> ma'am.<br> To be, Robin. The Prime Minister to be.<br> I haven't asked him yet.<br> He's a hard one to read, isn't he?<br> Yes. On the one hand,<br> his background is quite establishment -<br> father a Conservative,<br> educated at Fettes.<br> He had the same tutor<br> as the Prince of Wales.<br> We'll try not to hold that against him.<br> On the other, his manifesto promises<br> the most radical shake-up<br> of the constitution in 300 years.<br> - Think he'll try to modernise us?<br> - I wouldn't put it past him.<br> His wife has<br> anti-monarchist sympathies.<br> You may remember her curtsy<br> the first time you met.<br> It could best be described as shallow.<br> I don't measure<br> the depth of a curtsy, Robin.<br> I leave that to my sister.<br> Downing Street<br> is expected to be informal -<br> everyone on first-name terms,<br> at the Prime Minister's insistence.<br> - What, "Call me Tony"?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Oh, I don't like that.<br> Have we sent him a protocol sheet?<br> - Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.<br> - Why? You've met her before.<br> I know, but never one to one,<br> and never as Prime Minister.<br> Well, remember, you're a man<br> that's just been elected by the nation.<br> But she's still, you know, the Queen.<br> The audience room is upstairs.<br> When we reach the audience room,<br> I will knock.<br> We shall go straight inside.<br> Standing by the door, we bow,<br> from the neck.<br> I will introduce you.<br> The Queen will extend her hand.<br> You go to her, bow again,<br> then shake her hand.<br> A couple of other things -<br> it's ma'am as in ham,<br> not ma'am as in farm.<br> When you're in the presence,<br> at no point must you show your back.<br> - The presence?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> That's what it's called<br> when you're in Her Majesty's company.<br> Would you like to sit there, Mrs Blair?<br> How nice to see you again, Mr Blair.<br> - And congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Your children must be proud.<br> - I hope so.<br> - You've three, haven't you?<br> - That's right.<br> Such a blessing, children.<br> Do sit down.<br> Thank you.<br> Have we shown you<br> how to start a nuclear war yet?<br> - Er... no.<br> - Oh. First thing we do, apparently.<br> Then we take away your passport<br> and send you round the worid.<br> You obviously know my job<br> better than I do.<br> Yes, well, you are<br> my tenth prime minister, Mr Blair.<br> My first was Winston Churchill.<br> He sat in your chair<br> in a frock coat and top hat.<br> He was kind enough to give a young girl<br> like me quite an education.<br> I can imagine.<br> With time, one has hopefully added<br> experience and wisdom,<br> better enabling us to execute<br> our constitutional responsibility,<br> to advise, guide and warn<br> the government of the day.<br> Advice which I...<br> Iook forward to receiving.<br> Yes. We'll save that<br> for our weekly meetings.<br> If there's nothing else, I believe<br> we have some business to attend to.<br> Of course.<br> Your Majesty,<br> my party has won the election,<br> and so I ask your permission<br> to form a...<br> No, Mr Blair. I ask the question.<br> The duty falls upon me, as sovereign,<br> to invite you to become Prime Minister<br> and to form a government in my name.<br> And if you agree,<br> the custom is to say yes.<br> Yes.<br> Mrs Blair, lovely to see you again.<br> And congratulations.<br> You must be very proud.<br> - Yes.<br> - And exhausted, I imagine.<br> - Where will you spend the summer?<br> - France.<br> - Lovely.<br> - You'll be in Balmoral?<br> Yes. Wonderful place.<br> My great, great grandmother,<br> Victoria said,<br> "In Balmoral, all seems to breathe<br> freedom and peace<br> "and make one forget the worid<br> and its sad turmoils."<br> - Your Majesty...<br> - Oh, excuse me.<br> No. Really?<br> Oh. Yes, of course.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> We're going to have to leave it there.<br> Not too short, was it, 15 minutes?<br> - One doesn't want to be rude.<br> - No, ma'am.<br> Morning.<br> - "Thanks for coming. Now, fuck off."<br> - What was that about?<br> God knows.<br> It'll be something to do with Diana.<br> 'Princess Diana<br> embroiled in controversy<br> 'as she pulls out of a meeting<br> with MPs.'<br> Princess Diana moved to mend relations<br> with the former nanny...<br> Princess Diana attended<br> a memorial service<br> for the fashion designer<br> Gianni Versace.<br> '... where another<br> royal controversy sparkles.'<br> ...was embroiled<br> in a second controversy this week.<br> I am not a political figure.<br> Princess Diana sailed<br> out into the Mediterranean<br> in one of Mr Mohamed Al Fayed's<br> yachts today.<br> - With his son.<br> ...quarter of a million pounds<br> for photographs which appear<br> to show the couple embracing.<br> Once again,<br> her judgement's under scrutiny.<br> Earlier today, they visited the...<br> Robin Janvrin.<br> What?<br> Tell Sir Guy I want everyone in ASAP.<br> Ma'am? Ma'am?<br> - Yes?<br> - Ma'am, Mr Janvrin is here to see you.<br> What?<br> Oh.<br> Good evening ma'am.<br> I'm sorry to disturb, but I've just had<br> a call from our embassy in Paris.<br> - It's the Princess of Wales.<br> - Why? What's she done now?<br> I see. Er...<br> Who are we speaking to there?<br> Right, well, keep me updated.<br> It's Diana.<br> She's been in a car accident in Paris.<br> Is it serious?<br> Apparently Dodi Fayed is dead.<br> 'Let's recap on the details<br> of those injuries, Maxine.'<br> 'They're saying the Princess is in<br> the intensive care unit<br> 'of a southeast Paris hospital.<br> - 'She has concussion, a broken arm... '<br> - Why was she in Paris?<br> - I thought she was in London.<br> - You know what she's like.<br> Charles, isn't this awful?<br> - What will you do about the boys?<br> - Let them sleep until we know more.<br> - Yes, that's sensible.<br> - I should go to Paris.<br> I told my people to organise a jet.<br> - What, a private one?<br> - Yes.<br> Isn't that the sort of extravagance<br> they attack us for?<br> How else can I get to Paris<br> at this time of night?<br> Charles, dear, use the royal flight.<br> They keep one plane<br> on permanent standby<br> in case I should kick the bucket.<br> No, Mummy, he can't.<br> This isn't a matter of state.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Diana is not one of the royal family.<br> She's not an HRH.<br> - It's a private matter.<br> - She's mother to your grandchildren.<br> What is happening now?<br> I don't know. I can't hear.<br> Everyone's shouting.<br> - Thanks for coming in.<br> - The ambassador from Paris.<br> Good evening, sir.<br> Yes?<br> I've just spoken<br> to our ambassador in Paris, ma'am.<br> I'm afraid it's not good news.<br> No!<br> No...<br> No. No. No.<br> No.<br> Diana, Princess of Wales, has died<br> after a car crash in Paris.<br> The French government announced<br> her death this morning.<br> - What have I got on this week?<br> - Writing your conference speeches.<br> Well, let's cancel everything else.<br> This is going to be massive.<br> 'Her death was confirmed<br> by the French... '<br> - I'll make a statement in the morning.<br> - I've started coming up with ideas.<br> - She's only been dead an hour.<br> - Would you prefer I didn't?<br> Try and be very brave.<br> It's Mummy. She's dead.<br> They're going to go back to sleep.<br> Try, anyway.<br> My private secretary's office have<br> found a travel agency in New York<br> that will sell me a flight to Paris<br> with an hour's stopover in Manchester.<br> Perhaps you might consider<br> if it's an extravagance<br> to bring back the mother of the future<br> king of England in one of our planes.<br> All right. Of course.<br> John, I don't want the boys<br> to see the news and get upset.<br> Take the radio from the bedroom<br> and the TV from the nursery.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> - Well, well, well.<br> - Yes.<br> Are you all right?<br> Your sister called, from Tuscany.<br> I hope you told her<br> to cut her holiday short.<br> - I did.<br> - I can't imagine she was pleased.<br> - That's putting it mildly.<br> - What did she say?<br> Something about Diana being more<br> annoying dead than alive.<br> Never let the boys hear you talk<br> like that.<br> Of course.<br> Something to help you go down?<br> No, I think I'll write my diary<br> a little longer.<br> Fine. I'm going to bed.<br> 'We've heard nothing official<br> from the palace.<br> 'We don't know when we'll get<br> any statements from the palace<br> 'or when the royal family are due.'<br> That's how she will remain,<br> in our minds, our hearts, forever.<br> - OK? Got it.<br> - 'Where will you do it? '<br> - At the church, on the way in.<br> - I'll organise it.<br> 'Viscount Althorp, Diana's brother... '<br> Hang on. I want to watch this.<br> 'This is not a time<br> for recriminations, but for sadness.<br> 'However, I would say I always believed<br> the press would kill her in the end.<br> 'Not even I imagined they would take<br> such a direct hand in her death<br> 'as seems to be the case.<br> 'It would appear that every proprietor<br> and editor of every publication<br> 'that paid for intrusive photographs<br> of her has blood on his hands today.'<br> Not the press, mate.<br> You've got the wrong villain.<br> Tony...<br> - Oh. Got to go.<br> - You about to speak to the Queen?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Ask her if she greased the brakes.<br> Now, now.<br> Thanks.<br> - Hello?<br> - 'Putting you through.'<br> Oh... Right, OK.<br> - Is the Prince of Wales with the boys?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Good. And he's going to Paris?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm sorry to disturb, ma'am...<br> Ma'am...<br> ...but I have the Prime Minister<br> for you, from his constituency.<br> Lucky you.<br> Thank you, Robin.<br> I'll take it in the study.<br> - 'Your Majesty.'<br> - Prime Minister.<br> May I say how very sorry I am.<br> The thoughts and prayers of my family<br> are with you at this terrible time,<br> and with the princes in particular.<br> Thank you.<br> 'Is it your intention to make<br> some kind of appearance or statement? '<br> No. No, certainly not.<br> No-one in the royal family will speak<br> publicly. This is a private matter.<br> We would appreciate it<br> if it could be respected as such.<br> I see.<br> I don't suppose<br> anyone's thought about the funeral.<br> We've spoken with the Spencer family,<br> and it is their express wish<br> that this should be a private funeral<br> with a memorial service to follow.<br> Right.<br> As Diana was no longer<br> a member of the royal family,<br> we must respect their wishes.<br> I see.<br> 'You don't feel that in view<br> of her high profile and popularity,'<br> it might be an idea to pay tribute<br> to her life and achievements,<br> or even just to her as a mother?<br> Well, as I said,<br> it's her family's wish.<br> And the public, ma'am,<br> the British people?<br> 'You don't think<br> that might be denying them a chance... '<br> A chance to what?<br> 'To share in the grief? '<br> This is a family funeral, Mr Blair,<br> not a fairground attraction.<br> I think the Princess has already paid<br> a high enough price<br> for exposure to the press, don't you?<br> If there's nothing else,<br> the children have to be looked after.<br> Of course. Goodbye, Your Maj...<br> Her instinct is to do nothing,<br> say nothing,<br> and give her a private funeral.<br> Are you surprised? She hated her guts.<br> I think it's a mistake.<br> They screwed up her life.<br> I hope they don't screw up her death.<br> Where can I get a black tie?<br> Oh, the chaplain called.<br> He asked if he should make<br> any changes in the service,<br> any special mention of Diana.<br> What did you say?<br> - I told him not to change a thing.<br> - Quite right.<br> The less attention drawn to it,<br> the better, for the boys.<br> Yes.<br> We should find some company<br> for them, some young people.<br> I'll take them for a long walk<br> up Craggy Head.<br> Yes, but no guns, Philip. It is Sunday.<br> We're going, I believe, to Sedgefield,<br> the Prime Minister's constituency,<br> where he is about to make a statement.<br> 'Yes, the Prime Minister coming now<br> with his wife, Cherie.'<br> Yeah, well, apart from that?<br> He's on. Alastair, he's on! Come on!<br> 'Though her own life<br> was often sadly touched by tragedy,<br> 'she touched the lives of so many others'<br> in Britain and throughout the worid...<br> ...with joy and with comfort.<br> 'The people everywhere,<br> not just here in Britain, everywhere,<br> 'they kept faith with Princess Diana.<br> 'They liked her. They loved her.<br> 'They regarded her as one of the people.<br> 'She was the people's princess...<br> '... and that's how she will... stay,<br> 'how she will remain...<br> '... in our hearts<br> and in our memories... forever.'<br> A bit over the top, don't you think?<br> 'The Prime Minister, paying<br> his tribute to the Princess of Wales.'<br> The people of Britain, he said,<br> kept faith with Princess Diana.<br> They loved her.<br> She was the people's princess.<br> - Do we have the Royal Standard?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - And flowers?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> If we left it to the royal undertakers,<br> they'd bring her back in a crate.<br> Hello?<br> 'This is Lord Airlie.<br> May I speak to the Prime Minister? '<br> One moment, please.<br> Lord Airlie.<br> The Lord Chamberlain<br> in charge of the funeral.<br> You're meeting him at the airport.<br> - Lord Airlie.<br> - Good afternoon, Prime Minister.<br> It's my job to organise<br> all the ceremonial events.<br> There's no precedent<br> for the funeral of an ex-HRH.<br> Perhaps we should plan<br> for any contingency.<br> I propose a meeting tomorrow morning<br> at Buckingham Palace,<br> 'officials from all three palaces,<br> representatives of the Spencer family,'<br> the emergency services<br> and your people.<br> Absolutely. Of course.<br> Precedent?<br> Where do they find these people?<br> Thank you.<br> Brigadier Sir Charles Wood.<br> Air Commodore Wessex.<br> - Prime Minister.<br> - I'm so sorry, sir.<br> If there's anything<br> I or my government can do...<br> They stood up as we drove past,<br> in cafs, in restaurants,<br> removed their hats.<br> This was Paris,<br> and you could hear a pin drop.<br> - I imagine it will be the same here.<br> - The palace prefers a private funeral.<br> - What are your feelings on that?<br> - I...<br> I think that'll present us<br> with difficulties.<br> So do I.<br> My mother... The Queen comes<br> from a generation not best equipped.<br> She grew up in the war.<br> I think what we need,<br> what this country needs,<br> is a more modern perspective,<br> if you follow.<br> - Balmoral is...<br> - I think I understand.<br> 'An aircraft of the Queen's Flight<br> brought the Princess's body home,<br> 'where the Prime Minister gathered<br> with members of his government.<br> 'A black hearse crossed the Tarmac<br> 'and a Royal Air Force guard of honour<br> moved forward.'<br> Has anyone heard from the Spencers?<br> Did they say when the funeral will be?<br> Hmm? I don't know.<br> Nobody tells me anything.<br> 'President Clinton<br> heard the news last night.'<br> 'We liked her very much.<br> 'We admired her work for children,<br> for people with AIDS<br> 'for ending the scourge<br> of land mines... '<br> On our walk today, one of the gillies<br> said he'd seen a stag up Craggy Head.<br> - He reckoned 14 points.<br> - Oh.<br> We haven't had one<br> as big as that on the estate for years.<br> No. Quite.<br> '... and I was tremendously impressed... '<br> Anyway, I thought<br> it might be a good distraction.<br> - For the boys.<br> - What, stalking?<br> - You don't think it's too soon?<br> - Anything that gets them out is good.<br> '... as their relationship<br> deteriorated,<br> 'she became increasingly unhappy.<br> 'The couple divorced<br> in August of last year.<br> 'Their love story<br> brought crowds into the streets.<br> 'They came to see the Queen<br> and the Prince,<br> 'but most of all,<br> they came to see Diana.'<br> - I'm going to bed.<br> - 'But the fairytale was destined... '<br> I'll ring the Lord Chamberlain's office<br> to say we'll send representatives<br> to the meeting.<br> Thank you, Stephen.<br> She gave us so much.<br> Why couldn't we have given her<br> something and left her alone?<br> It just... hurts me so much.<br> I've never experienced<br> anything like this.<br> I wait to wake up,<br> like it's a bad dream.<br> Right, it's ten o'clock.<br> Let's get started.<br> Thank you all for coming<br> at such short notice.<br> I think we all agree that this is<br> a sensitive occasion,<br> which presents us<br> with tremendous challenges -<br> logistically, constitutionally,<br> practically,<br> diplomatically and procedurally.<br> Oh, Christ.<br> After 18 years of opposition,<br> I am proud to stand before you<br> as the new Prime Minister...<br> Labour Prime Minister.<br> I want to set an ambitious course<br> to modernise this country,<br> to breathe new life<br> into old institutions,<br> to make privilege<br> something for the many, not the few.<br> You think the royals are nutters?<br> You should meet their flunkies.<br> Two and a half hours to choose<br> between a hearse or a gun carriage.<br> You got raves in the press. This calls<br> you "The nation's mourner in chief."<br> This lot says you correctly judged<br> the country's mood.<br> - Hello?<br> - Even The Mail was impressed.<br> People's princess, mate. You owe me.<br> - Gordon for you.<br> - Tell him to hang on.<br> Alastair...<br> - Is it going to be a public funeral?<br> - Yeah. Saturday.<br> - It's a whopper. The Abbey, the works.<br> - Great.<br> - Has anyone told the Queen?<br> - I don't know.<br> No doubt some flunky will be<br> dispatched, grovelling on all fours.<br> Do you think it's wise<br> for the boys to go stalking?<br> Anything<br> that gets them out is good.<br> Maybe they shouldn't take guns.<br> If a photographer saw them,<br> it might send the wrong signal.<br> If there is a photographer out there,<br> he could be the first kill of the day.<br> I see Mr Fayed was buried last night.<br> At midnight. No cameras, no fuss.<br> Very dignified.<br> Why do they do that? Why do they bury<br> the bodies so soon after death?<br> Islamic tradition.<br> - Something to do with the heat.<br> - Mmm.<br> It stops the body decomposing.<br> Come in.<br> Good morning, ma'am. Ma'am.<br> Yes, Robin? What can we do for you?<br> Er... ma'am, there was a meeting<br> at the palace this morning.<br> About the funeral arrangements. Yes.<br> The Lord Chamberlain faxed these plans<br> for you to consider.<br> There is now general agreement, ma'am,<br> that a public funeral<br> would be more appropriate.<br> I see.<br> And what form will this funeral take?<br> At the moment, they're suggesting...<br> and, of course, these are early days,<br> basing it on Tay Bridge.<br> - Tay Bridge?<br> - What?<br> Tay Bridge is the code name<br> for my funeral.<br> Indeed, ma'am,<br> but it would be<br> for practical reasons only.<br> It's the only one<br> which has been rehearsed,<br> the only one<br> that could be put together in time.<br> But I supervised those plans myself.<br> Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain<br> was at pains to stress<br> that the spirit of the occasion<br> will be quite different.<br> For example, the suggestion is<br> that instead of 400 soldiers,<br> charities march behind the coffin.<br> And, instead of foreign heads of state<br> and crowned heads of Europe,<br> the guests would include a sprinkling<br> of actors of stage and screen,<br> fashion designers<br> and other... celebrities.<br> Celebrities?<br> Oh.<br> Er... was there anything else?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Oh, yes, one other thing.<br> The police commissioner was keen<br> that you consider<br> the idea of a condolence book.<br> It would give the growing crowds<br> something to do,<br> make marshalling them easier.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, of course.<br> - Oh, and the flowers.<br> - What flowers?<br> The flowers outside Buckingham Palace.<br> They're blocking the main gate,<br> and making things difficult<br> for the changing of the guard.<br> Fine. Just move them away.<br> The Lord Chamberlain was wondering<br> whether we shouldn't leave the flowers<br> and send the guards<br> through the north gate.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, of course.<br> Yes, quite right.<br> Stephen Lamport on One.<br> - Who?<br> - Prince of Wales's private secretary.<br> - Balmoral.<br> - He says it's urgent.<br> It's all right.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, Prime Minister.<br> The Prince of Wales has asked me<br> to thank you for your kind words.<br> Not at all.<br> The Prince feels that you and he<br> are both modern men<br> of similar mind,<br> who could work well together<br> at this difficult time.<br> Er... well, please thank His Highness,<br> and assure him<br> he can count on my full support...<br> ...at all times.<br> - Was that it?<br> - Er... yes.<br> Goodbye.<br> Bizarre.<br> - Why is Charles doing this?<br> - What?<br> Creeping up to me like this,<br> banging on about being modern.<br> He did it at the airport.<br> He knows that if the Queen<br> gets it wrong over Diana,<br> the royals will become<br> public enemy Number One.<br> - He's terrified of being shot.<br> - Who, Charles?<br> His people have asked<br> for extra protection.<br> He thinks if he's seen<br> to be on our side,<br> that will leave the Queen<br> in the firing line.<br> So it's OK for his mother<br> to take the bullet and not him?<br> What a family!<br> - Wait. Where are they?<br> - Up at Craggy Head.<br> - I'll come with you.<br> - In you go.<br> - Do you want me to drive?<br> - No. Certainly not.<br> - I thought you were getting a new one?<br> - What for? It's perfectly all right.<br> I was thinking<br> what Diana might have done<br> had it been me that died<br> in the tunnel in Paris.<br> She would have taken the boys<br> to Paris. I regret not doing that.<br> What, and expose them to the media?<br> That would have been dreadful.<br> They're better off here.<br> It's private. They're protected.<br> Whatever you thought of Diana,<br> she was a wonderful mother.<br> She adored those boys,<br> and never let them forget it.<br> Always warm, physical,<br> never afraid to show her feelings.<br> Especially if a photographer<br> was in sight.<br> She may have encouraged all that,<br> but still...<br> that was the extraordinary thing<br> about her -<br> her weaknesses and transgressions<br> only made the public love her more.<br> Yet ours only make them hate us.<br> Why do they hate us?<br> - Not us, dear.<br> - What?<br> Yesterday,<br> when we brought the coffin back,<br> there was a noise, a bang,<br> and I thought it was a gun.<br> I thought<br> someone had taken a shot at me.,<br> I think I'm going to walk back.<br> - I don't feel like stalking.<br> - Are you sure?<br> I'll take the dogs.<br> Walkies? Yes!<br> Who knows the way home? Come on.<br> 'Do you think<br> you will ever be queen? '<br> No, I don't. No.<br> Why do you think that?<br> I'd like to be a queen<br> of people's hearts, in people's hearts,<br> 'but I don't see myself<br> being queen of this country.<br> 'I don't think many people<br> want me to be queen.<br> 'By many people, I mean<br> the establishment I married into,<br> 'because they've decided<br> that I'm a non-starter.'<br> Charles and I had a talk<br> in the car today.<br> He was good enough<br> to share his thoughts on motherhood.<br> - What did he say?<br> - How wonderful Diana was.<br> That's changing his tune.<br> He thought her natural.<br> 'They see me as a threat<br> of some kind.'<br> Oh, for God's sake!<br> Maybe he's got a point.<br> Maybe we are partly to blame.<br> Oh, I can't watch this.<br> No, no. Wait. Please, no, leave it.<br> 'I don't go by a rule book.<br> I lead from the heart, not the head,<br> 'and it's got me into trouble<br> in my work.'<br> We encouraged the match.<br> We signed off on it, both of us.<br> You were very enthusiastic, remember?<br> She was a nice girl. Then.<br> And I was sure<br> he'd give the other one up,<br> or at least make sure<br> his wife toed the line.<br> - Isn't that what everyone does?<br> - Is it?<br> 'Was Mrs Parker Bowles a factor<br> in the breakdown of your marriage? '<br> 'There were three of us in this<br> marriage, so it was a bit crowded.'<br> I can't bear it. If you're watching,<br> I'll sleep next door.<br> - Early start tomorrow.<br> - Any luck with your stag?<br> No. But close,<br> a couple of hundred yards at one point.<br> One of the boys even got a shot off.<br> We'll get him tomorrow.<br> See you in the morning.<br> Not to worry. Night-night.<br> '... and with her obsession<br> with the belief<br> 'that Charles loved a woman he'd fallen<br> for years before, Camilla... '<br> # Heaven<br> # Must be missing an ngel<br> # Missing an ngel, child<br> # Cos you're here with me right now... #<br> The good news is the palace<br> agreed to video screens.<br> - And the bad news?<br> - Crash barriers.<br> - What about them?<br> - They expect over two million people.<br> There aren't enough barriers,<br> so we've gone cap in hand<br> to the French for theirs.<br> There's something else<br> I think you should see.<br> Can we run that piece again?<br> - Of course.<br> - You'll love this.<br> - '... find their behaviour disgraceful.'<br> - 'What do you think? '<br> 'I think it's disgusting that they've<br> not said a word relating to all this.'<br> - Look, I know all this.<br> - Wait for it.<br> '... not to have a flag up. I think<br> it's a disgrace on the royal family.'<br> 'OK, the Queen's not in residence,<br> but where is the flag?<br> 'Do you see what I'm saying<br> about the establishment? '<br> Don't tell me there isn't a flag<br> at half mast over Buckingham Palace.<br> 'Dodi, when them two were together,<br> it was a fairy tale come true.'<br> Will someone please save these people<br> from themselves?<br> - Fine, I'll call Balmoral.<br> - Planet Zog?<br> I've really got nothing better to do.<br> Come on, dogs. Come on.<br> Those fire lighters all right?<br> A bit damp?<br> Oh, well,<br> I brought some stew just in case.<br> - It's lamb. We can have that cold.<br> - No, we'll be all right.<br> Stay.<br> Robin had a call from the Prime<br> Minister, who expressed his concern.<br> - About what?<br> - The flag above Buckingham Palace.<br> He thinks it should be flying<br> at half mast.<br> I hope Robin said there isn't a flag<br> above Buckingham Palace.<br> There's the Royal Standard, which flies<br> to denote the presence of the monarch.<br> Since you're here, the flagpole is bare,<br> just as it should be.<br> Isn't it possible that for some people,<br> the Royal Standard is just a flag,<br> and the flagpole being bare<br> sends out the wrong signal?<br> - No, that's not the point.<br> - The point is it's over 400 years old.<br> It's never been lowered for anyone.<br> Your grandfather didn't get<br> the flat at half mast when he died,<br> and if your mother died tomorrow,<br> she wouldn't either.<br> Yes, Granny, but in a situation<br> like this, one has to be flexible.<br> It is just a flag.<br> "What about the Union Jack?"<br> Was Mr Blair's next suggestion.<br> For heaven's sake!<br> Next, he'll suggest you<br> change your name to Hilda.<br> Who does the think he's talking to?<br> You're the sovereign.<br> You don't get dictated to. You conceded<br> the idea of a public funeral.<br> You've opened the parks.<br> That's enough.<br> Ssh. The boys.<br> You wait.

Your tea's getting cold.<br> - Is that it?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Just the letter of condolence to the<br> widow of the ambassador to Brazil.<br> Thank you.<br> Tea.<br> Mr Janvrin, the Prime<br> Minister wishes to speak to Her Majesty.<br> Ma'am,<br> apparently the Prime Minister<br> is on the phone.<br> Tell him to call back.<br> No, no. It's all right. I'll take it.<br> - Prime Minister.<br> - Good morning, Your Majesty.<br> Sorry to disturb, but I was wondering<br> if you'd seen today's papers?<br> We've managed to look<br> at one or two, yes.<br> 'In which case, my next question<br> would be whether you felt<br> 'some kind of response<br> 'might be necessary? '<br> No. I believe a few over-eager editors<br> are doing their best<br> to sell newspapers.<br> It would be a mistake<br> to dance to their tune.<br> 'Under normal circumstances,<br> I would agree,<br> 'but...<br> Well, my advisors have been'<br> taking the temperature<br> among people on the streets,<br> and... well, the information I'm getting<br> is that the mood<br> 'is quite delicate.'<br> So, what would you suggest,<br> Prime Minister?<br> - Some kind of a statement?<br> - No, ma'am.<br> I believe<br> the moment for statements has passed.<br> 'I would suggest flying the flag<br> at half mast above Buckingham Palace...<br> ...and coming down to London<br> at the earliest opportunity.<br> 'It would be of great comfort<br> to your people.'<br> And would help them with their grief.<br> "Their grief"?<br> If you imagine<br> I'm going to come to London,<br> before I attend to my grandchildren,<br> who've just lost their mother...<br> then you're mistaken.<br> I doubt there is anyone who knows<br> the British people more than I do,<br> nor who has greater faith<br> in their wisdom and judgement.<br> And it is my belief that they will,<br> at any moment, reject this... this mood,<br> which is being stirred up by the press<br> in favour<br> of a period of restrained grief<br> and sober, private mourning.<br> That's the way we do things<br> in this country -<br> quietly, with dignity.<br> It's what the rest of the worid<br> admires us for.<br> If that's your decision, ma'am,<br> the government will support it.<br> - Let's keep in touch.<br> - Yes, let's.<br> Bloody fool!<br> And now your tea's gone cold.<br> Tony, Robin Janvrin on One.<br> He was listening in.<br> Robin?<br> I understand how difficult<br> her behaviour must seem to you,<br> but try and see it<br> from her perspective.<br> She's been brought up<br> to believe it's God's will.<br> 'She is who she is.'<br> I think we should leave God out of it.<br> It's just not helpful.<br> She hasn't seen anything like this<br> since the abdication,<br> and I cannot emphasise<br> the effect that had.<br> Unexpectedly becoming king<br> as good as killed her father.<br> 'I'm afraid she's in a state of shock.<br> 'This public reaction<br> has completely thrown her.'<br> All right, but first, we have to deal<br> with these terrible headlines.<br> - I'll do what I can with the press.<br> - I'm grateful, Prime Minister.<br> I can't promise anything.<br> It's not me they want to see.<br> Ask Alastair to come and see me.<br> Cancel what I'm doing tonight.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Your Majesty.<br> Thomas, where have they gone?<br> - Up to Abergannie Ridge, ma'am.<br> - All that way?<br> - Remind me, that's right at the fork?<br> - That's right, ma'am.<br> You follow the track for about a mile,<br> and you come to...<br> The river.<br> - One of the lads will drive you.<br> - No, I'll manage. Thank you.<br> Bugger it!<br> Oh, how stupid!<br> - 'Hello, Thomas.'<br> - Hello, ma'am.<br> I've done something foolish.<br> I've broken the prop shaft.<br> - Are you sure, ma'am.<br> - Yes, of course I'm sure.<br> It's the front one.<br> Lost the four-wheel drive.<br> Don't forget,<br> I was a mechanic during the war.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I'm fine.<br> - We'll come out straight away.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> I'll wait by the car. You are kind.<br> Bye.<br> Oh, you're a beauty.<br> Shoo! Shoo! Go on!<br> Go on.<br> Go on!<br> There are news crews outside waiting<br> for you to speak to the people.<br> - Yes.<br> - What's all that about?<br> I told the Queen's private secretary<br> I'd try to help with the press.<br> Why? Don't you think she deserves it,<br> sitting up there on her 40,000 acres?<br> Yes, but allowing her to hang herself<br> might not be in our best interests either.<br> Besides, I think there's something ugly<br> about the way<br> everyone's started to bully her.<br> The first thing that you obviously<br> think about...<br> is the rest of your family, and I...<br> When's she coming to London, Mr Blair?<br> - 'She's our figurehead.'<br> - 'She is.'<br> 'She wanted me to pass on<br> to the people crowding around... '<br> 'In a spare moment, the Prime<br> Minister went down Downing Street... '<br> - How are the boys?<br> - Not so good tonight.<br> A lot of slamming doors.<br> - I think they saw the papers.<br> - Oh, no!<br> I'll take them out<br> early again tomorrow morning.<br> Perhaps they'll take it out<br> on the stag.<br> 'What do you think<br> of the royal family? '<br> 'They've made a mistake.'<br> - Pardon?<br> - They've made a mistake.<br> - 'Why? What do you mean?

Bloody madness!<br> I've just been told<br> you've decided we're to follow<br> the Prime Minister's advice.<br> I just want to say I...<br> admire...<br> I think it's the right decision.<br> Let's hope we haven't left it too late.<br> 'These are historic shots<br> of the Windsors.<br> 'The Queen has had a change of heart.<br> 'She's clearly responding to the need<br> 'to feel that the royal family is<br> somehow engaged.<br> 'These flowers have been brought<br> to Balmoral<br> 'so she can see some token<br> of what's been expressed in London.'<br> Fish fingers.

Would you like me<br> to place those for you?<br> - No.<br> - Oh.<br> These are for you.<br> For me?<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Ma'am, there's been a last-minute<br> addition from Downing Street.<br> They're suggesting adding,<br> "and as a grandmother" here.<br> Right.<br> "So, what I say to you now,<br> as your Queen, and as a grandmother,<br> "I say from my heart."<br> Do you think you can say it?<br> - Do I have a choice?<br> - They're ready for you, Your Majesty.<br> - Just to confirm, this is live.<br> - Fine.<br> You'll be at the front of the six o'clock<br> news on all channels.<br> Yes.<br> Thank you.<br> - OK, nice and quiet.<br> - Ten seconds.<br> 'We cross, now, live,<br> to Buckingham Palace<br> 'for the Queen's tribute<br> to Princess Diana.'<br> Since last Sunday's dreadful news,<br> we have seen, throughout Britain<br> and around the worid,<br> an overwhelming expression of sadness<br> at Diana's death.<br> We have all been trying,<br> in our different ways, to cope.<br> It is not easy<br> to express a sense of loss,<br> 'since the initial shock<br> is often succeeded by other feelings,<br> 'disbelief, incomprehension, anger<br> and concern for those who remain.<br> 'We have all felt those emotions<br> in these last few days,'<br> so what I say to you now,<br> as your Queen, and as a grandmother,<br> I say from my heart.<br> Heart? What heart?<br> She doesn't mean a word of this.<br> That's not the point.<br> What she's doing is extraordinary.<br> 'In good times and bad... '<br> - That's how to survive.<br> - Listen to you.<br> A week ago,<br> you were the great moderniser,<br> making speeches<br> about the people's princess.<br> - Now you've gone weak at the knees.<br> - Ssh.<br> '... and for her devotion<br> to her two boys.'<br> I don't know why I'm so surprised.<br> At the end of the day, all Labour prime<br> ministers go gaga for the Queen.<br> What?<br> 'Millions who never met her,<br> but felt they knew her, will remember her.<br> 'I, for one, believe there are lessons<br> to be drawn from her life,<br> 'and from the extraordinary<br> and moving reaction to her death.<br> 'I share in your determination<br> to cherish her memory.'<br> I hope that, tomorrow, we can all,<br> wherever we are,<br> join in expressing our grief<br> at Diana's loss<br> and gratitude<br> for her all-too-short life.<br> May those who died rest in peace,<br> and may we, each and every one of us,<br> thank God for someone<br> who made many, many people happy.<br> 'Diana's coffin, now on the move<br> 'the short distance<br> from St James's Palace,<br> 'to her home at Kensington Palace<br> before her burial tomorrow.<br> 'It's incredible.

I think meetings have<br> a greater chance of success<br> if the Prime Minister is a walker.<br> It's how I think best, on my feet.<br> I've never been one for sitting around.<br> A good walk in fresh air<br> sorts everything out.<br> One in four, you said,<br> wanted to get rid of me?<br> For about half an hour,<br> but then you came down to London,<br> and all that went away.<br> I've never been hated like that before.<br> It must have been difficult.<br> Yes. Very.<br> Nowadays, people want glamour<br> and tears, the grand performance.<br> I'm not very good at that.<br> I never have been.<br> I prefer to keep my feelings to myself,<br> and, foolishly, I believed that was<br> what people wanted from their Queen -<br> not to make a fuss,<br> nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve.<br> Duty first, self second.<br> That's how I was brought up.<br> That's all I've ever known.<br> You were so young<br> when you became Queen.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, a girl.<br> But I can see<br> that the worid has changed,<br> and one must... modernise.<br> Well, perhaps that's where I can help.<br> Don't get ahead of yourself,<br> Prime Minister.<br> I'm the one<br> supposed to be advising you.<br> Come, dogs!<br> Tell me, Mr Blair, what might we expect<br> from our first parliament?<br> Er... well, ma'am,<br> top of the list is education.<br> We want to reduce classroom sizes.<br> Yes.<br> And create a lower teacher-pupil ratio.<br> Broadcast Facilities<br>
