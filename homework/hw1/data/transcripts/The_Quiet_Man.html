                        Well, then... Urrmm, now.<br> I'll begin at the beginnin'.<br> A fine, soft day in<br> the spring it was<br> when the train pulled into Castletown,<br> three hours late as usual,<br> and himself got out.<br> He didn't have the look of an<br> American tourist at all about him,<br> not a camera on him and, what was<br> worst, not even a fishing-rod.<br> Castletown?<br> - Castletown?<br> - Could you tell me the way to Inisfree?<br> Inisfree? Aw, five miles<br> and maybe a half more.<br> - Do you see that road over there?<br> - Yeah.<br> Don't take that one, it'll do you no good.<br> Now, the best road to Inisfree, and many...<br> Oh, Inisfree you want. Be savin' your<br> breath, let me direct the gentleman.<br> Happen to know the<br> way to Knoghenor?<br> If you knew the way there, would<br> he be asking the way to Inisfree?<br> There's many knows Knoghenor<br> that doesn't know Inisfree.<br> If you'd take the time to study your<br> country's history, Mr Maloney...<br> - ...you'd be the first to admit it.<br> - Don't send the poor man there.<br> The fishing is finished<br> there entirely. Tell<br> me, Yank, what is it<br> that you're after?<br> - Is it trout or salmon?<br> - All I want is to get to Inisfree.<br> Ah, now you're talking sense. The<br> best fishing in the country.<br> - True.<br> - Trout as long as your arm.<br> And salmon! The last one I got, I<br> expected Jonah to pop out of his mouth.<br> Ah, Inisfree. I'd bring<br> you there myself,<br> only I got to drive the train.<br> Hey, was I tellin' you about that<br> trout I got two summers before last?<br> - At Inisfree?<br> - Not at all!<br> At Ballygar, over the<br> other end of the country.<br> My sister's third young one<br> is living at Inisfree,<br> and she'd be only too happy<br> to show you the road.<br> - No, no, if she was here.<br> - It's Inisfree the man wants to go to.<br> - You see that signpost over there?<br> - What do you know...<br> Inisfree, this way.<br> I wonder, now, why a man<br> would go to Inisfree.<br> - Six foot six?<br> - Four and a half.<br> - Cincinnati?<br> - No, Pittsburgh.<br> Pi.. Pitss...<br> Don't you remember,<br> Seaneen, and how it was.<br> The road led up past the chapel,<br> and it wound, and it wound,<br> and there was the field where<br> Dan Tobin's bull chased you.<br> It was a lovely little house,<br> Seaneen, and the roses.!<br> Your father used to tease me about them,<br> but he was that proud of them, too.<br> That's nothin' but a<br> wee humble cottage.<br> That little place across the brook,<br> that humble cottage. Who owns it now?<br> The widow Tillane. Not<br> that she lives there.<br> - You think she'd sell it?<br> - I doubt it.<br> Don't bet on it<br> 'cause I'm buyin' it.<br> Why... why would a Yankee from<br> Pittsburgh want to buy it?<br> I'll tell you why, Michaleen Oge<br> Flynn, young small Michael Flynn,<br> who used to wipe my runny<br> nose when I was kid.<br> Because I'm Sean Thornton, and I<br> was born in that little cottage.<br> And I've come home, and<br> home I'm gonna stay.<br> Does that answer your questions once<br> and for all, you nosy little man?<br> Seaneen Thornton... The...<br> And look at you now.<br> What do they feed you, all you<br> men who are in Pittsburgh?<br> Steel, and pig-iron furnaces so hot<br> a man forgets his fear of hell.<br> When you're hard enough, tough enough...<br> other things.<br> Other things, Michaleen.<br> Now then, here comes myself,<br> that's me there, walking.<br> That tall, saintly-looking man.<br> Peter Lonergan, parish priest.<br> Good day, Father. Sean,<br> this is Father Lonergan.<br> Father, would you believe it?<br> This is Sean Thornton,<br> born right here in Inisfree,<br> home from America.<br> - Hello, Father.<br> - Ah, yes.<br> I knew your people, Sean.<br> Your grandfather... He died in<br> Australia, in a penal colony.<br> And your father, he<br> was a good man too.<br> Bad accident, that.<br> And your mother?<br> She's dead. America,<br> when I was twelve.<br> I'll remember her in the mass tomorrow.<br> You'll be there, seven o'clock.<br> - Sure, I will.<br> - Good.<br> Sean, I'd like to have a little<br> word with Michaleen here.<br> - Sure thing, Father.<br> - It'll only take a minute.<br> - It's a little matter...<br> - Take your time. I'll be up ahead.<br> Sean!<br> Hey, is that real?<br> She couldn't be.<br> Uh, nonsense, man. It's only a mirage<br> brought on by your terrible thirst.<br> Come up, Napoleon.<br> Over here we pronounce<br> it "Co-han".<br> Good morning.<br> None of that now. It's a bold,<br> sinful man you are, Sean Thornton.<br> Who told you to playing patty<br> fingers in the Holy Water?<br> - Just being polite, that's all.<br> - What is this?<br> Maybe you don't know it's a privilege<br> only for courting couples,<br> and then only when the<br> banns have been read.<br> And Mary Kate Danaher dippin' her<br> fingers in as neat as you please.<br> - What did you say her name was?<br> - Mary Kate Danaher.<br> And don't be getting any<br> notions in your head.<br> - Mary Kate...<br> - Forget it, Sean, forget it.<br> - Put it out of your mind.<br> - Why? What's the matter?<br> - She isn't married or anything?<br> - Married? That one?<br> Not likely. And her with her<br> freckles and her temper.<br> Oh, that red head<br> of hers is no lie.<br> Still, a man might put up with that<br> but not with her lack of a fortune.<br> The wealthiest woman in<br> Inisfree was the widow Tillane.<br> She had neither chick<br> nor child, poor soul,<br> but she was well-respected<br> and good to the poor.<br> - So you were born there, is that it?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> All Thorntons were born<br> there, seven generations.<br> I see. And what is your<br> thought, Mr Thornton,<br> are you planning to turn White O'<br> Mornin' into a national shrine?<br> Perhaps charge tuppence a<br> visit for a guided tour<br> through the cottage where<br> the Thorntons were born.<br> Are you a man of such eminence?<br> No, not exactly.<br> My own family has been in Ireland since<br> the Normans came hundreds of years ago,<br> but we've seen no reason to<br> establish monuments or memorials...<br> Look, Mrs Tillane, I'm not talking<br> about memorials or monuments.<br> Ever since I was a kid living<br> in a shack near the slag heaps,<br> my mother has told me about<br> Inisfree and White O' Mornin'.<br> Inisfree has become another<br> word for heaven to me.<br> When I quit the... When I decided to come<br> here, it was with one thought in mind.<br> Inisfree is far from being<br> a heaven, Mr Thornton.<br> Ma'am, Mr Red Will Danaher<br> wishes to be announced,<br> I mean, Squire Danaher.<br> Watch your muddy boots!<br> - Mrs Tillane.<br> - Mr Thornton, from America.<br> - Aw!<br> - Boo.<br> It's him I'm here<br> about, Mrs Tillane.<br> - Is it true?<br> - Is what true?<br> That behind me back, he's trying to steal<br> White O' Mornin' right from under me nose?<br> And what concern of yours<br> is this, Will Danaher?<br> Concern? Concern enough.<br> Haven't I made you a fair offer<br> for that same piece of land?<br> - And mine, lying right next to yours?<br> - You may keep your offers.<br> - Oh, so it's true. You sold it!<br> - No, I have not.<br> Oh, I knew it was a dirty lie<br> the very minute I heard it!<br> Sure, I said to him,<br> "Paggy McFarland, I won't believe that<br> Sarah'd be selling White O' Mornin'."<br> Why, it would be like building a<br> fence between your land and mine.<br> "And for a stranger to move in", says I.<br> "What would she be doing that for?"<br> And us so close to an<br> understanding, you might say.<br> - So you told him all that?<br> - That I did.<br> Down at the pub, I suppose, in<br> front of all those big ears,<br> with pints in their fists<br> and pipes in their mouths.<br> You may have the land, Mr<br> Thornton, for 600 pounds.<br> - Done!<br> - No, you can't. 610!<br> As I remember, you<br> said 700 pounds.<br> See here, little man... 710!<br> - How about an even thousand?<br> - A thousand and...<br> And... and I'll be saying good day to<br> you, Mrs Tillane, and all here but one.<br> And I've got you<br> down in my book.<br> My dad remembers his dad well.<br> Mike Thornton. He had<br> shoulders on him like an ox.<br> I saw him meself this mornin'. A tall,<br> handsome man, as I was passin' that chapel.<br> If you'd pass the pub<br> as fast as you pass the<br> chapel, you'd be better<br> off, little squint.<br> Just look at them! Eating<br> me out of house and home.<br> Get back to the fields!<br> There's work to be done.<br> Isn't it a bit early in the day<br> for the bottle... even for you?<br> Feeney, get your book out.<br> Set down the name, the<br> one Sean Thornton.<br> Oh, look at me clean floor!<br> You dirty little...<br> - Shut your gob.<br> - Aw, shut you, little man! Here.<br> Clean it up yourself, or there<br> will be no dinner tonight!<br> There now! Look now, you<br> mustn't mind himself this day.<br> That's all the work you're good<br> for, you little tattletail.<br> Feeney, have you written<br> the name I gave you?<br> I have.<br> Well, strike a line through it.<br> That's for him.<br> Sean Thornton...<br> So... He bought White O'<br> Mornin' in spite of you.<br> Good for widow Tillane.<br> Pay no attention to her at all!<br> Take no notice.<br> You do, and there'll be a fine<br> wake in this house tonight.<br> After all, he's got more right<br> to that land than you have!<br> He'll regret it to his dying<br> day, if ever he lives that long.<br> Will it be all right if I<br> leave my bags in here?<br> I imagine they'll<br> be safe enough.<br> If you see a little guy, Michaleen Flynn,<br> tell him I'm waiting for him in the bar.<br> It'll be a pleasure,<br> especially for Michaleen.<br> Thanks.<br> Is there anything you<br> should like now, Yank?<br> If I think of anything,<br> I'll let you know.<br> Evening.<br> Pleasant night.<br> - I'll try one of those black beers.<br> - Oh, the porter. Yes, sir.<br> Sir, will you join me? Matter of fact,<br> I'd like to buy everybody a drink.<br> I do not believe I heard<br> your name, tall man.<br> Thornton. Sean Thornton.<br> And... your father's name?<br> Mike. Michael Thornton. He used<br> to live here, by the Mornin'.<br> I just bought the place back.<br> That's why I'm here.<br> Then your grandfather would<br> be Ol' Sean Thornton.<br> - Right.<br> - Bless his memory.<br> So it's himself<br> you're named after.<br> Well, now. That being the case, it is a<br> pleasant evening and we will have a drink.<br> There was a wild colonial boy.<br> Jack Duggan was his name<br> He was born and<br> bred in Ireland<br> In a town called Castlemaine<br> - Good evening, Father.<br> - Is the rest of the committee here?<br> - They're waiting.<br> - Sorry we're late.<br> - The fishing was bad, was it?<br> - Fine lot of time we had for that!<br> - Oh, Michaleen...<br> - Commandant Forbes.<br> You can forget about the Commandant.<br> We're at peace now.<br> Sure, but I haven't<br> given up hope.<br> - Your Yankee friend is waitin' in the bar.<br> - Oh, he's here already...<br> Wait a minute. Who is he anyway?<br> He's a nice, quiet, peacelovin' man come<br> home to Ireland to forget his troubles.<br> Troubles?<br> Yes, he's a millionaire<br> like all the Yanks.<br> But he is eccentric.<br> Wait till I show you.<br> What is it?<br> A bag to sleep in. A<br> sleeper bag they call it.<br> I'm tellin' you. The sleeper bag...<br> Wait till I show you how it operates.<br> Where does it open?<br> Hurry up, I have an<br> important appointment.<br> - Well, open it up!<br> - Here.<br> At the early age<br> of sixteen years<br> He left his native home<br> And to Australia's<br> sunny shores<br> He was inclined to roam<br> He robbed a wealthy squireen<br> All arms he did destroy<br> A terror to Australia was<br> This wild colonial boy<br> Sean Thornton, the men of<br> Inisfree bid you welcome home.<br> Thank you.<br> "And the men of Inisfree<br> bid you welcome home."<br> - What's wrong with that little speech?<br> - Oh, you'd be knowin' what.<br> I'm a man from Inisfree,<br> and the best man.<br> And I bid no welcome<br> to a man fool enough<br> to pay 1000 pounds for a bit<br> of land that isn't worth 200!<br> True for you, squire.<br> Didn't I hear of someone<br> named Danaher bid 810?<br> Get your book out. Put his<br> name down: Dermot Fahy.<br> F- A-H-Y. No e's,<br> Squireen Danaher.<br> If you were half the<br> man you think you are,<br> you wouldn't begrudge a Thornton<br> the right to his birthplace.<br> What right has he to a<br> land he's never worked?<br> It's Thornton land, isn't it?<br> - You've too much of your own as it is.<br> - Quiet, if you please.<br> Parliamentary procedure.<br> Squire Danaher has the floor.<br> If I had the floor...<br> - ...I'd hit that big ape with it.<br> - Hold on.<br> I don't blame Mr Danaher<br> for gettin' on his ear.<br> Who's on his ear? Why, you and ten like<br> you couldn't put a Danaher on his ear.<br> - It's just a way of speaking...<br> - Mind your ways, then.<br> The point is, it's already done. I own the<br> property now, and since we're neighbours...<br> Neighbours? Neighbours...<br> Never!<br> And if I so much as catch you putting<br> one foot on my property, I... I...<br> And, oh, another thing. You keep<br> away from my sister Mary Kate.<br> She's not for the likes of you.<br> Where I come from, we don't talk<br> about our womenfolk in saloons.<br> You sort of make a habit of it.<br> This morning it was widow Tillane.<br> - What's that?<br> - That's true. It's ashamed you should be.<br> Hey, look, I'm not accusing Mary Kate.<br> It's him.<br> Why, this very moment, let<br> him deny it if he can.<br> At the back of the chapel, he took<br> liberties that he shouldn't have.<br> - I said "good morning" to her.<br> - Good morning?<br> - It was "good night" you had on your mind.<br> - That's a lie.<br> - That's a what?<br> - I said "that's a lie".<br> That's a word I take from no man!<br> Put up your fists.<br> - I'm not gonna fight you.<br> - But I'm gonna...<br> Thank you.<br> Danaher! What's the<br> matter with you?<br> He's drunk! Feeney, take<br> him home, will you.<br> Don't soil your<br> knuckles on the man.<br> - Come on, what do you say?<br> - Never.<br> Take the man's hand, or I'll read<br> your name on a mass on Sunday.<br> Take it. I'd join the<br> Church of Ireland first.<br> As if they'd have you. Shake<br> his hand like I tell you.<br> Come on, come on. Shake hands?<br> It's a good grip you have. I always<br> hated a flappy handshake myself.<br> Father Paul!<br> Michaleen, introduce me to this<br> quiet, peacelovin' man of yours.<br> I have a strange notion we're<br> going to be friends, Yank.<br> Give me a minute. Just let<br> some blood run back into this.<br> Sean Thornton... His grandfather, a grand<br> man he was, was hung in Australia.<br> I could tell you blood-curdlin'<br> stories about him, but me throat...<br> All right, come on.<br> He was born and<br> bred in Ireland<br> In a town called Castlemaine<br> He was his father's only son<br> His mother's pride and joy<br> And dearly did<br> his parents love<br> This wild colonial boy<br> Are you sure you won't change your<br> mind, and come around home with me?<br> Don't worry about it. I've got<br> my sleeping bag, haven't I.<br> Well, it's a nice, soft night.<br> So, I think I'lljoin my comrades,<br> and talk a little treason.<br> - Good night, Sean.<br> - Good night, Michaleen.<br> God bless you.<br> So bold one you are. Who gave<br> you leave to be kissin' me?<br> - So you can talk?<br> - Yes, I can, I will, and I do.<br> It's more than talk you'll be<br> gettin' if you step closer.<br> - Don't worry. You've got a wallop.<br> - You'll get over it, I'm thinkin'.<br> Some things a man doesn't<br> get over so easily.<br> Like what supposin'?<br> Like the sight of a girl coming through<br> the fields, with the sun on her hair.<br> Kneeling in church, with<br> a face like a saint.<br> Saint, indeed.<br> And now, coming to a man's<br> house to clean it for him.<br> But... that was just my way of<br> bein' a good Christian act.<br> I know it was, Mary Kate<br> Danaher, and it was nice of you.<br> Not at all.<br> - Hello.<br> - Good morning, Mr Thornton.<br> - How are you, Fa.. Doctor...<br> - No, no. Mr.<br> And on formal occasions,<br> the Reverend Mr Playfair.<br> And this is Mrs Playfair.<br> Well, Mr Thornton.<br> You are a wonder.<br> It looks the way all the Irish<br> cottages should... and so seldom do.<br> And only an American would<br> have thought of emerald green.<br> - Red is more durable.<br> - And the roses! How nice.<br> You'll need lots of horse manure.<br> Fertiliser, I mean. Horse is the best.<br> Oh, I brought you a plant. You know,<br> "a primrose by a river's brink".<br> "Brim", not "brink". The<br> next line ends in "hymn".<br> Poets are so silly, aren't they? Oh,<br> I hope you're not one, Mr Thornton.<br> - Oh no, ma'am, I...<br> - Thornton.<br> There's a familiar ring to it.<br> Ring to it... Thornton...<br> It's a common name. Thank you<br> for the plant, Mrs Playfair,<br> this is damn... darn...<br> awfully nice of you.<br> Oh?<br> It's a bed. Excuse me.<br> Morning. That's a fine<br> big bed, Mr Thornton.<br> Biggest one I could find.<br> Is that a bed or<br> a parade ground?<br> Oh, a man'd have to be a sprinter to<br> catch his wife in a bed like that.<br> Whoa!<br> Mr Flynn... And what are you all<br> dressed up for, Michaleen Oge?<br> I ha...<br> - I have come...<br> - Oh, I can see that.<br> - But from whose pub was it?<br> - P... pub?<br> You've a tongue like an adder.<br> I go about me own business,<br> and tell Thorn Seanton<br> he's well off without you.<br> Wait a minute. What was that?<br> Well, if you listened and not<br> be interruptin' the matchmaker.<br> I have come...<br> - ...at the request of Thorn Seanton...<br> - Sean Thornton.<br> Shut up.<br> Bachelor, and party<br> of the first part...<br> to ask of you, strictly<br> and formally, here...<br> Mary Kate Danaher, spinster...<br> and party to the<br> second part...<br> Well? Go on, you were sayin'?<br> Me mouth is like a dry crust, and<br> the sun is that hot, and me pate...<br> Would you be steppin'<br> into the parlour?<br> The house may belong to my brother, but<br> what's in the parlour belongs to me.<br> I will then, and I hope there's a<br> bottle there, whoever it belongs to.<br> It could be.<br> You have a fine, steady hand.<br> To good bargaining.<br> To resume:<br> - The party of the first part...<br> - That's him.<br> Has instructed me to enquire before<br> enterin' into formal negotiations...<br> whether the party to<br> the second part...<br> That's me.<br> Thinks kindly of the general idea, or<br> in his own words... American, eh...<br> eh, yes, he wants to<br> know if you go for it.<br> Go for it?<br> And if you do, he'll<br> speak to your brother.<br> That won't be easy.<br> Oh, as well I know it.<br> He'd as soon put his fist into my<br> teeth as bid me the time of the day.<br> What did Sean... the party of the<br> first part, say about my fortune?<br> He says he doesn't give it...<br> He says it's a matter of<br> complete indifference to him.<br> - He did?<br> - He says he doesn't give a sh...<br> He says it's all one to him if you come in<br> the clothes on your back, or without them.<br> Oh, he did, did he? Well.<br> A fine opinion he must<br> have of me, if he thinks<br> I'd go to any man without<br> a proper fortune.<br> And this you may tell your<br> Mr Party of the first part:<br> When I wed, whatever's<br> my own, goes with me.<br> Get up, little man.<br> And all this furniture is mine.<br> And I have that china, and linen, and<br> and my mother's rings, brooches, my<br> grandmother's veil, her silver comb...<br> Thirty pounds odd in notes and silver I've<br> earned these past 15 years, that's all.<br> You're a well propertied woman. I<br> wouldn't mind marryin' you meself.<br> Eh, where'd you<br> leave the bottle?<br> And I'd have you tell him, that I'm no<br> pauper to be going to him in my shift.<br> Lo, young May moon<br> is beamin' love<br> The glow of one's<br> lamp is gleamin' love<br> How sweet to row<br> through Mourner's Grove<br> While the drowsy<br> world is dreamin'...<br> - You know "The Peter And The Ghost".?<br> - I do not.<br> Neither do I.<br> Could you use a little<br> water in your whiskey?<br> When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey,<br> and when I drink water, I drink water.<br> Back to business now.<br> What answer will I give Sean<br> Thornton, Mary Kate Danaher?<br> Well, you can tell<br> him from me that...<br> that I go for it.<br> Here's to steal a few<br> hours from the night<br> My dear<br> - How do I look?<br> - You look fine.<br> - Hey, what do I say?<br> - I'll do all the talkin'.<br> And I'm suppose to stand<br> here like a dummy?<br> Shh, now.<br> - Will, there's someone coming to call.<br> - Who?<br> It's... well...<br> It's Michaleen Oge Flynn, and<br> there's a gentleman with him.<br> Here, Will, put on your coat.<br> Will Danaher, they're<br> comin' to the front door.<br> Since when has the back<br> door been not good enough?<br> God bless all in this house.<br> Good evening.<br> Miss Danaher, we'd like a<br> word with your brother.<br> Come on in so, and welcome.<br> Easy now!<br> Mr Sean Thornton, bachelor, meet<br> Miss Mary Kate Danaher, spinster.<br> Miss Danaher, meet Mr Thornton from<br> Pittsburgh, Massachusetts, USA.<br> - Good evening, Miss Danaher.<br> - This...<br> This way, please.<br> - Eh, this is my brother...<br> - Leave the room.<br> - But...<br> - I said, leave the room.<br> - Yes, Will.<br> - Sit down, that's what chairs are for.<br> - If you've come for supper, you're late.<br> - Gracious invitation, but thank you, no.<br> I don't suppose there's<br> a drop in the house.<br> - Help yourself to the buttermilk.<br> - Buttermilk? The Borgias would do better.<br> We'll come with your permission<br> to the object of this visit.<br> You've noticed, I presume, that I'm<br> wearin' my official black coat.<br> I have. For your<br> dead friend here.<br> I need no trouble to arrange<br> any marriages for me.<br> I see. You've been making fine progress<br> with widow Tillane in the last ten years.<br> - Is that what you've come to talk about?<br> - I have not.<br> I've come to talk about<br> your sister and him.<br> Aw, get out.<br> If he was the last man on the face<br> of the earth, I'd still say no.<br> Now just a minute.<br> If it's a question of<br> the girl's fortune...<br> Why, if it'd be a shilling<br> piece he wanted with her...<br> - ...I'd still say no.<br> - Come on, Michaleen. I told you so.<br> - I'll explain it to her myself.<br> - Hey, Yank, I'll count three.<br> If you're not out of the house by<br> then, I'll loose the dogs on you.<br> If you say three, you'll never<br> hear the man count ten.<br> - Oh, Mary Kate, we tried.<br> - We'll see him again some other time.<br> I thank you anyway, Sean<br> Thornton, for the asking.<br> You don't think this changes anything?<br> It's what you say that counts, not him.<br> Now, now, Sean. You've gone<br> too far, that's enough.<br> Say, what is this? We're gonna<br> get married, aren't we?<br> - I don't get it.<br> - This is Ireland, Sean, not America.<br> Without her brother's consent<br> she couldn't, and wouldn't.<br> I'm sorry for both of you.<br> Those were the bad days. Sean with a face<br> as dark as the black hunter he rode.<br> A fine, ill-tempered<br> pair they were.<br> It was only a matter of time before<br> one or the other broke his neck.<br> We knew things couldn't<br> go on this way.<br> Easy, Sean!<br> Hello, Mary Kate... Danaher.<br> Good morning, Sean Thornton.<br> So, we formed a<br> little conspiracy.<br> The Reverend Mr and Mrs Playfair, Michaleen<br> Oge and, saints forgive us, myself.<br> And on the day of the Inisfree Races,<br> we sprung the trap on Red Will Danaher.<br> Remember, you make your speed<br> when you hit the water.<br> - Yes, father.<br> - And ride carefully, my son.<br> Yes, mum.<br> Thornton, no silks.<br> - Your colours, Thornton.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Good luck.<br> Ladies, gentlemen, your<br> attention, please!<br> Will all the lovely ladies,<br> who are putting up their<br> bonnets for the Inisfree Cup,<br> please place their bonnets<br> on the finishing line.<br> Ladies, your bonnets, please!<br> - Will you not be putting up your bonnet?<br> - Indeed, I will not.<br> - No?<br> - No!<br> Okay, Michaleen, the<br> widow's bonnet.<br> Will all the gentlemen riders<br> please go to the starting line.<br> All riders, please.<br> Crown at 20 to 1 on the Yank. I'm<br> given 20 to 1 on the Yank...<br> - I'm given 30 to 1... 40 to 1 on Danaher.<br> - Flynn!<br> If you've done any<br> matchmaking between Thornton<br> and my widow, I'll put<br> you in me pocket.<br> Ah, so you've heard?<br> Father, what sort of a<br> scoundrel is this Yank?<br> One minute it's me sister,<br> and the next it's herself.<br> Well, blame no one but yourself.<br> If you'd saved me as your matchmaker,<br> you would've been married long since.<br> - True, Will, true.<br> - I'm not saying it's too late yet.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Why has the widow stood you up so long?<br> - You're a fine looking man.<br> - I am.<br> - A rich, propertied man.<br> - And well she knows it.<br> - Father, will I tell him?<br> - Go ahead, Michaleen.<br> What woman would come into a<br> house with another woman in it?<br> If you got rid of Mary Kate, the<br> widow would be in like a shot.<br> No.<br> Yes. You had your chance<br> and you flubbed it.<br> You refused Seaneen Thornton,<br> and he reneged on you.<br> Now, I doubt if he'd take your sister<br> if you put 1000 pounds on her.<br> Father Lonergan?<br> I can't say it's true, and<br> I won't say it's not.<br> - But there's been talk.<br> - Oh, a lot of talk.<br> A lot of talk, eh?<br> Two women in the house, and<br> one of them a redhead.<br> Two women.<br> Three Our Fathers, and<br> three Hail Marys.<br> Morning, Mary Kate.<br> Morning, children.<br> Don't sit there gawking. You're<br> gonna put up your bonnet.<br> - I will do no such shameless thing.<br> - You will.<br> I will not!<br> No bonnet, Mary Kate?<br> What a pity.<br> Betting will now stop,<br> and the sale of all intoxicating and<br> alcoholic drinks will cease. I mean it now!<br> Oh, Sergeant Major, in<br> your good time, please.<br> The Yank's holdin' back.<br> Foul!<br> Look at that crazy Danaher!<br> Wouldn't it be wonderful<br> if he broke his neck?<br> Maybe he will now, God willing.<br> Will... Will, come on!<br> - Foul.<br> - I didn't see it!<br> Come on, Sean! Sean... I<br> mean Paul, Father Paul.<br> - Thornton!<br> - He took your bonnet, Sarah.<br> Fine race! You rode<br> like a trooper.<br> Trooper... Trooper Thorn, of course! I<br> knew I'd seen you somewhere before.<br> Now that you know, I wish you'd<br> keep it under your hat. Forget it.<br> - I understand. It'll be our secret.<br> - Thanks.<br> Your bonnet, Mrs Tillane.<br> - A cup for the winner.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Flynn... Does your offer still stand?<br> - Well, eh, that depends.<br> - You... eh, you mentioned... 500 pounds.<br> - 350, and not another penny.<br> Well, I speak to me principal<br> of the first part, eh?<br> Good morning, good morning.<br> Come on.<br> Well, now. The banns<br> having been read...<br> and no man objecting...<br> I'm permitting this man<br> to court me sister.<br> But under the usual conditions.<br> Mr Flynn?<br> - Do you assume the full responsibility?<br> - I do, I do.<br> And from now on, they'll do the walkin'<br> and the talkin' under me own eyes.<br> Well, then. Let the<br> courting commence.<br> None of that! Hands to yourself,<br> and your own side of the road.<br> - Get onto the other side of the cart.<br> - Up you go.<br> ) Why do we have<br> to have you along?<br> Back in the States I'd honk the horn<br> and the gal'd come-a-runnin'...<br> Come-a-runnin'? I'm no woman to<br> be honked at, and come-a-runnin'.<br> America... Pro-hi-bi-tion.<br> Do you see that over there?<br> That's the ancestral home<br> of the ancient Flynns.<br> It was taken from us by...<br> by... by the Druids.<br> You're the quietest<br> couple I've ever herded.<br> We'll get nowhere by this rate.<br> Off you get. I'll let you<br> do a healthy mile or so,<br> just to get you two walking<br> correctly together.<br> Now, she's a fine, healthy girl.<br> No patty fingers, if you please.<br> - Nice day.<br> - It is that, Mr Thornton.<br> - That's a pretty bonnet you have on.<br> - Bonnet?<br> Don't you talk to me about bonnets!<br> After leaving mine stuck up...<br> Easy now, easy now. Is this<br> a courting or a fight?<br> Have the manners not to<br> hit a man until he's<br> your husband, and until<br> he'll hit you back.<br> I am sorry. I have<br> a fearful temper.<br> You might as well know about it now,<br> instead of finding out about it later.<br> We Danahers are a<br> fighting people.<br> I can think of a lot of things I'd rather<br> do to one of them... Miss Danaher.<br> Shh, Mr Thornton. What<br> will Mr Flynn be thinkin'?<br> Can you ride a bike?<br> Well, what are we waiting for?<br> Mary Kate Danaher! Sean!<br> Eh... ep... Come on!<br> Come back here!<br> Come back at once!<br> Come back here!<br> Come back at once!<br> Come back here! Come back!<br> I think you have more<br> sense than I have myself.<br> Whoa there, Freddy.<br> If anybody had told me six months ago, that<br> today I'd be in a graveyard in Inisfree<br> with a girl like you that<br> I'm just about to kiss...<br> - The kiss is a long way off yet!<br> - Ha?<br> We just started the courting and<br> next month we'll walk together,<br> and the month after that there'll<br> be the trashing party...<br> No.<br> - Maybe we won't have to wait that month...<br> - Yup.<br> - ...or for the trashing party...<br> - No.<br> - ...or for the walking out together.<br> - No.<br> And so much the worse<br> for you, Sean Thornton,<br> for I feel the same<br> way about it myself.<br> And so they were married in the same<br> chapel I gave them their baptism.<br> Later, there was a nice,<br> quiet little celebration.<br> Oh, as I went out one mornin:<br> It being the month of May<br> A farmer and his daughter<br> abide their bonny way<br> And the girl had only come<br> in to the milking of her cow<br> Sayin'I will an'I must get<br> married, The humour is on me now<br> Oh, the humour is on me now,<br> Oh, the humour is on me now<br> Sayin'I will an'I must get<br> married, The humour is on me now<br> So, at last the daughter<br> married, she married well-to-do<br> And loved her darlin'husband<br> a month, a year, or two<br> But he was all a tyrant<br> as he quickly rode about<br> Sayin'I'm sorry I ever<br> married, The humour is on me now<br> Oh, humour is on me now,<br> Oh, humour is on me now<br> Sayin'I'm sorry I ever got<br> married, The humour is on me now<br> To a successful conspiracy.<br> - A toast, to the bride and groom!<br> - One moment.<br> There will be no toasts until<br> we've seen the bride's fortune.<br> The bride's fortune?<br> You'll see it, never fear.<br> We'll see it now, if you please.<br> The proprieties must be observed.<br> - Father Lanergan.<br> - Feeney.<br> A collection of furnishings, linen,<br> and pewter goes with the sister...<br> of Will Danaher.<br> Then, a toast.<br> May their days be long,<br> and full of happiness.<br> May their children be<br> many, and full of health.<br> And may they live in<br> peace, and freedom.<br> Reverend Fathers, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Attention, please.<br> Squire Danaher has the floor.<br> In other<br> words, he's got somethin'<br> to say to you all.<br> Thank you. I have a little<br> announcement to make.<br> Fill up the glasses.<br> All of them.<br> Eh, today, I've given<br> my sister in marriage.<br> My only sister, and now she's<br> gone from the house of Danaher.<br> - But what's in a house without a woman?<br> - That's true.<br> That's right, what's a house<br> without a woman in it?<br> Yeah, what's a house<br> without a woman in it?<br> Where would any man of<br> us be without a woman?<br> - Even Father Lonergan had a mother.<br> - What do you expect?<br> Yeah, what do you expect.<br> What do you expect...<br> So... So...<br> - So, without further eloquence...<br> - Without further eloquence...<br> So, without further eloquence, I<br> will give you a toast to myself...<br> who is soon to be wed.<br> All she has to do is to<br> say that little word.<br> When's the happy<br> day, Sarah darlin'?<br> Have you lost the little<br> sense you were born with?<br> - What's the matter, Sarah darlin'?<br> - And don't "darlin" ' me.<br> Who gave you the right to<br> make such an announcement?<br> But Sarah... They all said...<br> Why... The Reverend Mr Playfair,<br> Mrs Reverend, Father Lonergan.<br> Eh, little Flynn... Michaleen.<br> - Didn't you tell me...<br> - Oh, I didn't, I didn't.<br> Oh, you lied, didn't ya?<br> You lied, didn't ya?<br> You all lied! It's bad enough for<br> you people, but my own priest.<br> You got her by fraud and falsity.<br> You put them up to this.<br> - I don't know what you're talking about.<br> - Will, for heaven's sake.<br> - Danaher, you're crazy!<br> - Crazy, am I?<br> This is something you<br> won't get, now or never!<br> Now, get out of here.<br> All of you!<br> The Reverend first, ladies<br> and gentlemen, get out!<br> Get out! Come on,<br> let's go home.<br> No, not without my fortune. It's<br> mine, and my mother's before me...<br> Steady, Trooper, steady.<br> Let's go home.<br> Ever since I was a little girl, I've<br> dreamed of havin' my own things about me.<br> My spinet... over there,<br> and the table here, and...<br> my own chairs to rest upon.<br> And...<br> And the dresser over<br> there in that corner.<br> And... my own china and<br> pewter shinin' about me.<br> And now...<br> I didn't know you felt<br> that way about it but...<br> seems like a lot of fuss and grief<br> over little furniture and stuff.<br> It is a pretty cottage, isn't it?<br> Yeah.<br> I think so.<br> - Don't touch me. You have no right.<br> - What do you mean no right?<br> I'll wear your ring, I'll<br> cook, and I'll wash.<br> I'll keep the land,<br> but that is all!<br> Until I've got my dowry safe<br> about me, I'm no married woman.<br> I'm the servant I've always been,<br> without anything of my own.<br> That's ridiculous! You're<br> my wife, and fortune...<br> - What is this?<br> - Haven't I been trying to tell you?<br> Not until you have my dowry, you<br> haven't got any bit of me. Me, myself!<br> I'd still be dreaming amongst the<br> things that aren't my own...<br> as if I had never met you.<br> There's 300 years of happy dreamin<br> in those things of mine, and...<br> I want them. I want my dream.<br> I'll have it and I know it!<br> - I'll say no other word to you.<br> - All right.<br> You'll have your dowry, or daughter<br> of fortune, or whatever you call it.<br> Well, get it then.<br> There will be no locks<br> or bolts between us,<br> except those in your own<br> mercenary little heart.<br> - Sean.<br> - How'd you sleep?<br> Don't be shamin' me, please,<br> in front of your friends.<br> What...? Oh, okay.<br> There that I learned<br> all me courtin'<br> Many lessons I took in the art<br> The Cupid, the<br> blagger, while sportin'<br> An arrow drove straight through<br> me mush, mush, mush, toor-i-li-anny<br> Me mush, mush,<br> mush, toor-i-li-ay<br> So I lathered him<br> with me shillelagh<br> For he trod on the tail 'o me<br> mush, mush, mush, toor-i-li-anny<br> And just like<br> the dingle before<br> I lathered him<br> with me shillelagh<br> For, he trod on<br> the tail of me coat<br> Hello, the house! Anyone up?<br> - Good mornin'!<br> - Good mornin'.<br> I... I suppose it's a bit<br> early to be callin'.<br> After you left last night,<br> Mary Kate, a couple<br> of us persuaded Danaher<br> to change his mind.<br> It's a... what might be called a<br> sort of a belated wedding present.<br> My things... My furniture!<br> We'd brought them over last night,<br> but due to the circumstances...<br> Thanks, thanks.<br> - Okay, easy now.<br> - God bless all here.<br> That's right. Oh, be careful.<br> Over there by the wall.<br> No, no, no. Turn it around, so that<br> the light shines on the music.<br> - That's grand. That's grand now.<br> - Where do you want this?<br> - Mighty handy.<br> - It...<br> It was my mother's, and my<br> mother's mother's before.<br> - Where do I put it?<br> - Where do you suppose?<br> Where do you suppose...<br> - We're sorry about the dowry, Mary Kate.<br> - We couldn't get him to change his mind.<br> Not even Father Lonergan could do it.<br> Let him keep it.<br> - Keep my fortune?<br> - You've got your tables and chairs.<br> - What do we care about his money?<br> - My money.<br> Let him have it if it<br> means that much to him.<br> What manner of man is<br> it that I've married?<br> A better one, I<br> think, that you know.<br> Impetuous! Homeric!<br> Oh, Inisfree<br> My island, I'm returning<br> From wasted years,<br> across the wintry sea<br> And when I come back<br> To my own dear island<br> I'll rest awhile<br> Beside you<br> Bromwell Creek<br> Now I know why you have so many<br> rock walls in this country.<br> Roses! Are you plantin' roses?<br> - Yeah.<br> - A fine farmer you are.<br> - Not a turnip, or a potato in the field.<br> - Or children.<br> Sorry.<br> Well, I... I suppose they'll make a<br> very fine display around the cottage.<br> - It is a pretty cottage, isn't it?<br> - I think so.<br> Let's see now.<br> We need a plough, and a cultivator,<br> and seed for planting.<br> About a horse for the ploughing...<br> We could sell that hunter of yours.<br> I'll buy another horse for the ploughing.<br> Why not a tractor?<br> Oh, a tractor... Nasty, smelly things.<br> Besides, they're an awful price.<br> - With a horse, you get other advantages.<br> - Yeah. For the roses.<br> Roses, again.<br> You...<br> We could do our<br> shopping in Castletown,<br> and if we put a good foot under<br> us, we'd be back by suppertime.<br> - Five miles!<br> - Well, that's just a...<br> Good stretch of the legs, huh?<br> All right, get on<br> your walking shoes.<br> I'll be a minute.<br> So, you're not a woman<br> to be honked at, ha?<br> Why, it's beautiful!<br> Did you ever see...<br> - It looks like it could fly.<br> - Only one horsepower, but it's all yours.<br> - Mine?<br> - Sure. Think you can drive it?<br> Hold on to your hat!<br> You take care of that, Feeney.<br> Let's have another pint.<br> I'm buying this one.<br> High time.<br> - What's that?<br> - I said, that's fine, squire.<br> Good health to you all.<br> - Look, he sold the crossbreds.<br> - The what?<br> - The sheep he's been planning on.<br> - Oh.<br> Hurry, now is a good time to ask him.<br> Well, go on.<br> - Ask him what?<br> - About my money.<br> He can't say that he hasn't<br> got it with him now.<br> Can't you understand that I didn't<br> marry you for your fortune?<br> I don't give... a<br> hang about the money.<br> But he does! That's the<br> whole point of it.<br> - Now will you go and ask him?<br> - No. Why shame ourselves?<br> Shame? The shame's on you, not on me.<br> Or on me too, if I married a coward.<br> Is that what you think of me?<br> What else if you let him<br> rob you out of my money?<br> Money! I'm sick of the talk of it. Is<br> that all you Danahers think about? Money?<br> Quiet! He's just<br> behind that rock.<br> - This is very important...<br> - Oh, salmon! He's winking at me.<br> I've been trying to catch<br> this one for ten years.<br> I've got to talk to you about<br> my husband and myself.<br> There he is.<br> Father, I... I...<br> You see...<br> - Father, could I... tell you in the Irish?<br> - Hush, hush.<br> Sleeping bag, Father, with...<br> with buttons.<br> Woman, Ireland may be a<br> poor country, God help us,<br> but here a married man<br> sleeps in a bed, not a bag,<br> and for your own good...<br> Help, help, there he is!<br> - I've been waiting for this for 10 years!<br> - Keep his head up.<br> - There's that beauty, that...<br> - Keep his head up. Keep a tight line.<br> I've got you! I'll get him!<br> - Tight line it is.<br> - Keep his head up!<br> His head is up!<br> For ten years I have...<br> Get the net, woman.<br> Oh, you got him, Father.<br> Keep his head up, you fool!<br> Get the net!<br> Get the net, woman!<br> - God help us!<br> - Oh.<br> Sleeping bags...<br> If you ever go across<br> the sea to Ireland<br> Then maybe at the<br> closin' of your day<br> You will sit and<br> watch the moon rise<br> Over Claddagh<br> And see the sun go down<br> On Galway Bay<br> For the breeze is blowin'<br> across the sea from Ireland<br> You're just in time.<br> Just done me drink.<br> - Join us, Sean.<br> - Oh, you will have a drink, Sean?<br> No, thanks.<br> I wanna talk to you, in private.<br> If there's anythin' you<br> got to say, say it here.<br> I'd rather talk in private.<br> What's the matter? You're among friends.<br> They fought for you, didn't they?<br> Maybe they'll do it again.<br> I'm not askin' anybody to<br> do my fightin' for me.<br> Oh, so you're willing to<br> do your own, are you?<br> You know what I came for.<br> I do. I just want to<br> hear you ask for it.<br> Just ask for it, Yank.<br> - You've got 20 pounds on him.<br> - And so I have.<br> What if I put one of me fists in me pocket?<br> Right or left? You choose, go on.<br> Go on, that's fair<br> enough, isn't it?<br> The fightin' Thornton!<br> - It was Mr Thornton, so I brought him in.<br> - Bless my soul. Sit down.<br> - Have you tiddled your last wink?<br> - I have.<br> - No cheating?<br> - I have not.<br> - Do you play tiddly-winks?<br> - No, I...<br> Maybe I shouldn't have<br> butted in like this...<br> Nonsense. How is<br> your lovely bride?<br> - Fine.<br> - Elizabeth, say good night to Mr Thornton.<br> But he's only just come... oh. Very well.<br> Good night, Mr Thornton.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Cyril.<br> Good night, Elizabeth.<br> Pleasant dreams.<br> - Are you sure...<br> - Good night, Elizabeth.<br> You're the only one I can level with.<br> I gotta<br> talk to somebody, or<br> I'll blow my top.<br> - Danaher, of course?<br> - Yeah.<br> Since you know who I am... or was, you<br> know why I don't want any fighting.<br> Yes, I was reading about<br> it again this evening.<br> Some men collect butterflies, some stamps.<br> My hobby's always been sporting events.<br> There it is.<br> "Trooper Thorn quits ring."<br> "Heavyweight challenger hangs up<br> gloves after fatal knockout."<br> "Vows he will never<br> fight again."<br> It's a very<br> understandable reaction.<br> The papers all say it was an accident.<br> Just one of those things.<br> It's just one of those<br> things in a scrapbook,<br> but when you carry<br> it around in here...<br> Tony Gardello was a good egg.<br> Nice little wife and a<br> home, a couple of kids.<br> A clean fighter.<br> I didn't go in there to outbox him. I<br> went there to beat his brains out.<br> To drive him into the<br> canvas, to murder him.<br> That's what I did.<br> For what? Purse, a<br> piece of the gate.<br> Lousy money.<br> And now money is behind<br> your trouble with Danaher.<br> They think I'm afraid of fighting. All<br> the friends I've made, even my wife.<br> - Well, aren't you in a way?<br> - Did you ever kill a man?<br> Well, I have, and all this<br> talk about her big fortune...<br> It's not that important.<br> Perhaps it is to her.<br> It must be strange<br> to you from America,<br> but it's an old, old custom here,<br> and believe me, it's a good custom.<br> The fortune means more to<br> her than just the money.<br> Not to me, it isn't. Not<br> worth fighting for.<br> - Is your wife's love worth fighting for?<br> - I don't know.<br> All I know is that... I won't fight,<br> unless I'm mad enough to kill,<br> and if that means losin' her...<br> I don't know.<br> - Maybe she doesn't love me enough.<br> - It's a difficult situation.<br> I think you'll find the right<br> answer in God's good time.<br> And when that time comes,<br> I hope I'm still here.<br> - You're not leaving, are you?<br> - It's a possibility.<br> My bishop is coming tomorrow<br> on his annual visit,<br> and I've got such a small congregation,<br> just 2-3 people at the service.<br> He may transfer me.<br> The place wouldn't be<br> the same without you.<br> Elizabeth and I just love this place.<br> We were born here too, you know.<br> The bishop's a good egg,<br> maybe it'll be all right.<br> Oh, by the way. Don't<br> underestimate Danaher.<br> He may be clumsy, but he's got a<br> tremendous right and a jaw of granite.<br> I did a little bit of<br> boxing in my time.<br> You won't be laughin'<br> now, will you?<br> It was at Trinity.<br> "Lightweight champion, 19..."<br> The year doesn't matter.<br> It was long, long ago.<br> All right.<br> By the way, would you<br> join me in a glass of...<br> Oh, no.<br> No. You'll be in<br> training now, of course.<br> - Did you have any supper?<br> - No.<br> I'm not hungry.<br> - The drink sometimes does that to a man.<br> - I haven't had anything to drink.<br> If you wanna know, I was<br> talking to the vicar.<br> - Mr Playfair.<br> - That's strange.<br> I had a long talk<br> with Father Lonergan.<br> Woman of the house!<br> Where's me tea?<br> Mary Kate?<br> Save your breath, boy. She's<br> gone from you, and small wonder.<br> - What are you talking about? Where is she?<br> - She came tappin' at me door.<br> "Will you join me to<br> the train", says she.<br> Why?<br> The very question. "Why", says I.<br> "Because I love him", says she.<br> "I love him too much to go on<br> livin' with a man I'm ashamed of."<br> - What time was this?<br> - Time for the Dublin train.<br> Saddle up my horse,<br> will you, please.<br> Saddle his horse?<br> I'll have no part in helpin'<br> you to put more shame on her.<br> Saddle his horse...<br> Dam da dam da, diddle de da...<br> Well, we're off!<br> Then, might I suggest that the train<br> already is four and a half hours late.<br> Now, is it my fault?<br> There's a match at Ballygar, and<br> the champions of all Ireland...<br> If you knew your country's history<br> as well as you claim to know it,<br> you'd know that they haven't been beaten<br> west of the Shannon for the last 22 years.<br> - True!<br> - It's a lie!<br> If this means what<br> I hope it means...<br> Danaher versus the Yank. It'll<br> be weeks on the green this time.<br> Morning.<br> Good day to you, sir.<br> Five minutes, did you say?<br> Right!<br> He's walkin' her back,<br> the whole long way!<br> It's Homeric, that's<br> what it is, Homeric.<br> - Post a lookout. They may go home first.<br> - Where's your pistol?<br> - In the same place.<br> - Excuse me, general.<br> One by land, two by sea,<br> and I'll follow the lot.<br> What a day for Inisfree!<br> On a day like this I can<br> say only one thing.<br> Gentlemen, the drinks<br> are on the house!<br> Well, they are.<br> Darling, here is your shoe!<br> Why, you...<br> It's only five miles. Just a<br> good stretch of the legs.<br> - You lost your shoe.<br> - Thank you very kindly, sir.<br> Mr... Mr Sean! Here's a good<br> stick to beat the lovely lady.<br> Thanks!<br> I think your in-laws are comin'<br> to visit you, Squire Danaher.<br> Danaher, you owe me 350 pounds.<br> Let's have it.<br> So, the IRA is in this, too, eh?<br> If it were, Will Danaher, not a stone<br> of your fine house'd be standin'.<br> A beautiful sentiment.<br> I'll pay you... never.<br> That breaks all bargains.<br> You can take your sister back.<br> It's your custom, not mine.<br> No fortune, no marriage.<br> We call it quits.<br> You'd do this to<br> me, your own wife?<br> - After what...<br> - It's done.<br> There's your dirty money.<br> Take it.<br> Count it, you spawn, and look.<br> If ever I see that face of yours<br> again, I'll push that through it.<br> Charge it!<br> I'll be goin' on home now. I'll<br> have the supper ready for you.<br> All right, Will,<br> you asked for it.<br> Three to one given on Danaher.<br> Three to one...<br> - I'll have some of that. Ten on Thornton.<br> - Done! Anyone else?<br> Gentlemen, if you please.<br> This is a private fight.<br> The Marquis of Queensbury rules<br> will be observed on all occasions.<br> Mind your nose, squire.<br> Okay with me, Michaleen!<br> Thanks.<br> Non-belligerents will<br> kindly remain neutral.<br> Now, shake hands and come out fighting.<br> I thank you.<br> Did you hear that, everybody? The<br> Marquis of Queensbury rules.<br> - The Marquis of Queensbury rules.<br> - Mar..<br> Come on, get up,<br> Marquis of Queensbury.<br> - I hope that Thornton beats him senseless.<br> - He's a married man, Sarah.<br> Who cares about him? It's<br> that big bully concerns me.<br> "I'm the best man in Inisfree.<br> " As if I didn't know that.<br> Call them and tell them<br> to send reinforcements.<br> There's a riot here.<br> Five to one on the<br> big chap, Snuffy.<br> - Given or taken?<br> - Given.<br> - You've had enough?<br> - No.<br> Well, give a man a hand, then.<br> Yes, inspector. Thank you, sir.<br> - What did he say?<br> - To put five pounds on Danaher's nose.<br> - Another ten on Thornton!<br> - Another.<br> - A pound on Danaher.<br> - Two pounds on Danaher, please.<br> Two pounds?<br> "... Hands of a hundred battles,<br> eye on a thousand besides..."<br> "... stood alone on the victorious<br> field, his buckler bent..."<br> "... his broken sword clutched<br> in his mighty hand..."<br> "... the blood of a thousand wounds<br> oozing from his open veins..."<br> - Father! Father Lonergan!<br> - Shh, shhh.<br> - A big fight in the town!<br> - And in this fish right here.<br> - I'd put a stop to it but...<br> - You do that. It's your duty.<br> But you see, it was Danaher<br> and Sean Thornton!<br> - Who?<br> - Danaher and Sean Thornton.<br> Why the devil<br> didn't you tell me?<br> - Shouldn't we put a stop to it?<br> - We should, lad, we should.<br> It's our duty, yes,<br> it's our duty.<br> Come on, come on!<br> - How's that bettin' going?<br> - Even money, but don't ruin it.<br> Well, Danaher, you're a good<br> fight, I'll say that for you.<br> When it comes to that, it's<br> been a pleasure beatin' you.<br> Thanks.<br> - Will you take another 20 on Thornton?<br> - No, the book's closed.<br> - A pound on Thornton against the squire.<br> - Go away!<br> - How about a drink?<br> - The drink will be on the house.<br> That's a good idea. The people of Ballyglon<br> are comin' over by bus, thousands of them.<br> That's a good idea, not that I'm tired.<br> I'm as fresh as a daisy.<br> You look more like a black-eyed<br> Susan to me. Let's go.<br> - Is that a public house?<br> - Yes, your lordship.<br> - Are they going in?<br> - Yes, your lordship.<br> - Does that mean that the fight's over?<br> - No, that's just the end of round one.<br> Come, keep away, keep away!<br> Whiskey? No, that'll be too warm, it'll get<br> your blood up. Porter is the very thing.<br> Ah, it's peaceful and quiet<br> in here, isn't it? Yeah.<br> You know...<br> This has been a fight I'd<br> come a long way to see.<br> I hope you can stick<br> around for the finish.<br> Don't worry about that!<br> You know, Yank. I've taken<br> quite a likin' to you.<br> I'm gettin' real<br> fond of you, too.<br> Your widow, me sister... She<br> could've done a lot worse.<br> - True, true.<br> - Poor woman.<br> - Thanks, fill them up again.<br> - You buy me no drinks.<br> - The drinks are on the house, sir.<br> - I'm takin' no drinks from you, squint.<br> - I'm buyin' the drinks.<br> - You can buy me a drink at your wake.<br> And not before.<br> I'm buyin'!<br> Bar towel!<br> - What time is it?<br> - Half past five, sir.<br> Lord, he beat you!<br> Why... I hope you won't be vexed with me,<br> but I've lost three pounds to Mrs Delany.<br> I know I shouldn't<br> have bet but...<br> There you are,<br> Stuffy, 15 pounds.<br> - Hello there, Elizabeth.<br> - Your lordship.<br> - And what have you been doing all day?<br> - If you'll excuse me, I'll...<br> I'll get your tea, Snuffy.<br> There was a wild colonial boy<br> Jack Duggan was his name<br> He was born and<br> bred in Ireland<br> In a place called Castlemaine<br> He was his father's only son<br> His mother's pride and joy<br> And dearly did<br> his parents love<br> This wild colonial boy<br> Woman of the house! I brought<br> the brother home to supper.<br> He's kindly welcome.<br> God bless all in this house.<br> - Wipe your feet.<br> - Thank you, ma'am.<br> Sit down, sit down. That's<br> what chairs are for.<br> Hurry it up!<br> Well, then. So peace and quiet<br> came once again to Inisfree,<br> and we were... Good heavens,<br> what's that woman up to now.?<br> Make way, she'll be<br> runnin'you down with that.!<br> When the Reverend Mr<br> Playfair comes down,<br> I want us all to cheer like Protestants.<br> Now, spread out!<br> Hip, hip, hooray!<br> Hip, hip, hooray!<br> No patty fingers, if you please.<br> The proprieties at all times.<br> Hold on to your hats. Come on.<br>
