Thank you very much.<br> - How's Nick this morning?|- Kind of restless.<br> - When did you get in?|- Last night.<br> - What's Durko doing here?|- Back working for Nick.<br> You know how burned Nick was|when they sent him up.<br> - Did the old man spring him?|- No. Nick.<br> Here we go again.<br> Listen, Mannick,|did Nick seem to be okay today?<br> - Outside of being restless?|- Yeah, I guess so.<br> All right, here's the score card.<br> That guy, Higgins,|that guy the old man was grooming,<br> spilled to the crime commission.<br> - I just got the tip.|- Wow!<br> Yeah, straight. And it's a cinch|Nick don't know about it yet...<br> - Where's Tony?|- Just about due, Nick.<br> - What are you guys cooking up?|- How do you mean, Nick?<br> We got to think of something.<br> Nick's going to blow his top|when he hears about Higgins,<br> now that he's got that old torpedo back.<br> Nick's got to be softened up some way.<br> Yes, that's right. The old man will|take care of Higgins his way,<br> and it'll be neat.<br> None of this rip-and-tear stuff, providing...<br> - He's waiting for you.|- I'm right on time.<br> Always right on time for Nick.<br> - He doesn't like to wait. He gets nervous.|- Tony.<br> You've been shaving Nick|a long time, right?<br> - Sure. Long time. Why?|- You and him, you're pretty close, right?<br> - Sure, close. Say, I better...|- He's paid you out plenty of dough, right?<br> - You wanna do him a favor?|- Me do Nick a favor? How?<br> Look, Tony, nobody can talk to Nick.<br> Nobody can tell him anything.|You know what I mean?<br> - Sure, I know.|- Maybe you could.<br> Mr. Mannick, please,|I mind my own business. I don't...<br> Off-hand, you know what I mean?|Like barber conversation, yak, yak, yak.<br> Only it means something,|like how the world's changing,<br> how things aren't the same anymore,<br> how a guy's got to be careful|and not keep on in the same old rut.<br> - Get smart.|- Yeah, Tony, see what he means?<br> Just conversation.|Nick can't get sore with that.<br> Yeah, sure, I give him that kind|of conversation all right, but...<br> - But, what?|- But Nick is no fool.<br> Tony may be not so smart like Nick,|but he understands.<br> Oh, no, no, no. I do this for Nick.<br> You know, I don't seem to get around|as fast as I used to, Nick.<br> - I got two grandchildren now.|- That so?<br> Yeah. I got a son married and a daughter.<br> Sons-in-law, they're all the same,|not like me.<br> We talk. We talk.<br> I don't understand.<br> Yeah? How's that?<br> Well, the world is changing, maybe.|Too fast. Maybe I stay the same.<br> My kids are different.<br> My son-in-law, my daughter-in-law,|she's different.<br> No, things seem is very easy for them,|hard for me.<br> - Go ahead, Tony. This is interesting.|- That's all, Nick.<br> The world has changed. Maybe,|I have trouble because I don't change.<br> What's the matter?<br> That's what I say. I'm getting old.<br> My hand is not so steady like it used to be.<br> That's too bad. I got a tender skin.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Were you talking to Mannick|before you came in here?<br> - Yes, Nick.|- What about?<br> What about?<br> - About me, Tony?|- No.<br> Tony, when you let guys use you,<br> be sure they're smart guys.<br> I'll be back.<br> Get inside.<br> - All right. Spill. What is it?|- What is what, Nick?<br> You got something to say, say it to me.|Don't try to prime Tony.<br> - Why, that...|- Do you think he had to tell me?<br> How do you think I got where I did?<br> Not by being outsmarted|by clucks like you.<br> Well?<br> It's your story.<br> Nick, I got to tell you, this Higgins guy.<br> - Yeah?|- He spilled to the crime commission.<br> - He did, eh?|- Yeah, straight tip.<br> Yeah, Nick. And the old man's|sure gonna take care of him.<br> How, by paying his fare out of town|so he can come back and talk again?<br> Nick, the old man, he'll...<br> I guess I didn't spring Durko|none too soon.<br> - Harry!|- Good morning, Foster.<br> - Good morning.|- How did it go?<br> - Thank you. Fine.|- How was the trip?<br> - Not bad.|- How'd the Governor take it?<br> - Like a man.|- And the commission?<br> Shocked and fighting mad.<br> - Are they really going to back us?|- Playing rough?<br> - Get any sleep?|- Not much.<br> They're meeting here Saturday.<br> To consider our evidence?<br> If we can prove it, they'll hang them.<br> Well, look at Higgins alone.|I figure 126 years.<br> - Only Higgins?|- Earning for tax reports, $60 a week.<br> - And banking $600.|- In four different banks.<br> - What's the plural of bigamy?|- Oh, we can't prove that yet.<br> His friends even get|their laundry mixed up.<br> - So Higgins was a romantic?|- Oh, versatile.<br> You name it, Higgins did it,|and we'll prove it.<br> Well, this is all fine, but...<br> - Where does it lead?|- Exactly.<br> Higgins was up to his armpits|in the Acme Real Estate Company.<br> - Are you sure?|- We've had two sessions with him.<br> - Would he talk?|- All lies, but they led to this.<br> - Well, get him back.|- Oh, he's coming back. Voluntarily.<br> To explain some little discrepancies.|In about five minutes.<br> Yes, indeed. A beautiful morning.<br> - Beautiful for Welsh.|- Our candidate.<br> Yes, we're giving Welsh|a great opportunity for public service.<br> You're late, Higgins.<br> - Connolly, where's the old man?|- He's not in.<br> - He promised me that judgeship.|- He changed his mind.<br> - Whoever heard of Welsh?|- That's the point.<br> All right. Tell the old man I'm through!<br> He's reconciled to that.<br> Now, if you will just sign this, please.<br> - Connolly, I lost my head. I didn't really...|- Just there at the bottom.<br> - If I do, is everything okay?|- Sign it.<br> Now, if you'll stamp this, Davis.<br> - Notary. Your notary stamp, Davis.|- Oh, sure, sure. I'm a notary.<br> Hello, Higgins.<br> Why, hello, Mr. Scanlon.|Didn't know you ever came up here.<br> - Down?|- Hold it, son. This man's going with you.<br> Thanks, Mr. Scanlon. Thanks.<br> Blow, shyster.<br> All settled, Nick,|just as the old man told you it would be.<br> Signed and witnessed.<br> You boys got a lot of faith|in human nature.<br> He talked once before. He'll talk again.<br> Either a man's the type who talks|or he's not. Higgins is the type.<br> Now, he may or he may not be.|Anyway this stops it.<br> So this is the fancy Dan Operation|I've been hearing about.<br> This is it.|Quite an improvement, don't you think?<br> Not so much for the coroner to do.<br> He gets paid.<br> When we take over|the operation of a city...<br> This is my city, bright boy!<br> Just an expression, Nick.<br> But now that you're associated with us,|you'll be seeing a lot of new techniques.<br> Like this one?<br> You'd handle it differently, no doubt.<br> A little rougher, maybe.<br> Nick, with our organization,|those methods are no longer feasible.<br> "No longer feasible," he says.<br> The old man considers physical violence|outmoded, unnecessary.<br> What do you know? I think Higgins had|an accident down there.<br> Nick!<br> - He just fell. Like that.|- His heart, maybe.<br> - Hey, this guy's been shot.|- Shot?<br> I'm going to beat that light.<br> Watch it. Copper.<br> You guys in a hurry or something?<br> Sorry, Officer.|I got to get these brakes adjusted.<br> Okay, okay. Go ahead.<br> Johnson, a guy got shot|just around the corner on Oak.<br> for a limousine driven by...<br> I thought so.<br> Manslaughter. Extortion. Larceny.<br> And parole.<br> Get me a wanted report.<br> This is the kind of thing the old man hates|and is changing.<br> Too many loose ends.|Too much emphasis on the physical.<br> I'm quoting, as you know, Turk.<br> Could you quote some more?<br> - Policy?|- Yeah, policy. Nick Scanlon.<br> There's an election coming up.|Maybe after that's over...<br> The old man moves cautiously.|"Give a man enough rope," he says.<br> What was the circulation of this report,|all departments?<br> What district is Johnson in?<br> McQuigg's.<br> What's the matter with Nick?<br> What's he using for brains?|McQuigg's poison.<br> Since we're talking about McQuigg,<br> can't something be done about him?|Can't the old man...<br> Too much has been done about McQuigg|as it is.<br> He's been shifted, exiled, you might say,|but he always crops up.<br> That's what I mean.<br> McQuigg's got a great reputation.<br> Do I have to remind you again|about the election?<br> If we bust McQuigg,<br> every newspaper in town|will be down on us.<br> They'll want to know, "Why, why?"<br> Sure, but newspaper readers forget fast.|It goes in one eye and out the other.<br> Why can't McQuigg cooperate?|We've given him every chance.<br> Maybe he's honest.<br> All right, Turk. This is your baby.|See what you can do with it.<br> So he says,|"How do you like your new captain?"<br> I says, "I've been in the army.|I'm used to hard-boiled top kicks."<br> McQuigg is a good policeman.<br> I don't know about good,<br> but he's the toughest so-and-so|I've ever met on the force.<br> Tears the whole place upside down|in one week.<br> Well, it needed it.<br> This ain't a hot spot.<br> Hey, you a relative or something,|Johnson?<br> No, I just think policemen should be|tough and honest.<br> Please, no speeches. It's just a job.<br> If it's a job, get on it.<br> - Time for inspection.|- He's got you, too, eh, Delaney?<br> You a comedian?<br> Let's go.<br> Hurry it up, men.<br> Atten-hut!<br> Ready, Captain.<br> Boys, you don't know me|and I don't know you.<br> I run a precinct one way.<br> We might as well understand each other|right now.<br> I have rules and I make no exceptions.<br> Our job is protecting the public,|the taxpayer.<br> Don't ever forget that.<br> I will not stand for laxity,|slovenliness or second best.<br> You do your jobs right|or you'll hear from me.<br> As for dishonesty or shady stuff,|one time and you're out.<br> There's no excuse for it.<br> What happens in other precincts|is none of our business.<br> Our job is to just make sure|that our own house is clean.<br> If a man breaks the law and you see him,|arrest him.<br> I don't care who he is|or what influence he's got.<br> I'll take the responsibility.<br> Understand that?<br> - All right.|- Okay, men. Dismissed.<br> - Johnson.|- Yes, sir.<br> That was a nice make, Johnson.<br> - Good work.|- Thanks, Captain.<br> Hi.<br> City hall on fire?<br> I'm hiding out|from the new crime commission.<br> - They must know where to start.|- All reformers start well.<br> Well, at least they got you out|in the daylight.<br> Your district's safe in daylight.<br> What's up, Turk?<br> Your beat man, Johnson,|turned in a good make.<br> Yeah, I know. I just commended him on it.<br> What's Johnson like? Ambitious?<br> In the right way, yeah.<br> - What else?|- Everything you're not.<br> That covers a lot of territory.<br> Combat veteran,|third man in the civil service exams.<br> Clean record, no relatives,|no pull, no politics.<br> Poor kid.<br> - He'll learn.|- No.<br> It's political pets like you|who will learn from kids like Johnson.<br> Can I start now?<br> - Oh, send Johnson in, will you?|- Yes, sir.<br> Johnson, the Captain wants you.<br> Johnson, this is Sergeant Turk<br> of the state's attorney's|Special Investigation Department.<br> - This is a good make, Johnson.|- Thanks.<br> - If you're sure it was Durko.|- Positive.<br> - But you didn't recognize the other man?|- No.<br> - Even after you'd run the files?|- He's not in the files.<br> - What's this all about, Turk?|- Our department wants Durko.<br> Then find him and pinch him.<br> Yeah, but if your beat men|scare him prematurely...<br> Murderers in my district will be pinched|on sight!<br> You tell the state's attorney so from me.<br> Keep your shirt on, Mac.<br> Nice work, Johnson.<br> Captain.<br> Captain, am I dumb or is someone trying|to cover up something?<br> When I think you're dumb, Johnson,|I'll let you know.<br> Johnson, how would you like|a special assignment on this?<br> Very much, sir.<br> - All right, you're relieved of beat duty.|- Thank you, sir.<br> Captain, who's big enough|to buy Durko out for a job like this?<br> You just stick to detail.|Let me worry about the rest.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Officer, I'd like to file a complaint.<br> - Well, madam?|- I haven't been kissed all day.<br> How would you feel if I had the night shift?<br> Indignant.<br> Well, I've heard the days can be|very beautiful this time of year.<br> - Was today beautiful for you?|- I dug up some more stuff on Durko.<br> - He must have quite a record.|- Yeah.<br> Manslaughter. Larceny. Extortion.<br> He killed a policeman in Cincinnati,|they think.<br> But they couldn't indict him.<br> How can men like that ever be paroled?<br> Well, suppose you needed a killer,|where would you go to get him?<br> - Bob, is it worth it?|- What do you mean?<br> Risking your neck to arrest men like that<br> so the higher-ups|can turn them loose again.<br> Well, this policeman they think he shot|had three kids.<br> Well, what if we had three kids?<br> You'd be half done. I want six.<br> - But, Bob, I'm serious.|- Hurry up with dinner, will you, Lucy?<br> - Well, what's your rush?|- I've got to get back to the station.<br> Oh, no. Not tonight.<br> - We're celebrating.|- I've got to keep moving on this case.<br> Celebrating what?<br> Well, what do you think|I've been trying to tell you?<br> I'll bite.

In my district.<br> - I never set foot in your district.|- Don't.<br> Of course, as a free citizen|and a taxpayer...<br> - A what?|- I pay taxes.<br> I keep books.<br> For instance, my taxes would pay|the salaries of 10 guys like you, McQuigg.<br> Public servants.<br> McQuigg, the public servant.<br> You and I should've had a little talk|a long time ago, Nick.<br> I'm all for it.<br> I never forget a pal.<br> I've been intending to thank you|for all you've done for me,<br> like getting me buried in a no-action spot<br> after I knocked over|those horse parlors of yours.<br> Why, Tommy? Me?<br> Then you and the boys decided|you wanted to make an action spot<br> out of a no-action spot,|but there was McQuigg, eh?<br> I pinched one of your boys|for criminal assault and got a conviction.<br> Of course, he never did time.<br> There was an appeal, this and that,|the old merry-go-round.<br> But it was inconvenient, wasn't it, Nick?<br> So I was transferred again.<br> I should be an inspector by now, Nick,<br> if you hadn't known me in the old|10th Ward days and been my pal.<br> You flatter me.<br> Let's quit kidding, Nick.|Stay out of my district.<br> I'm tired of playing horse.<br> I'm making this a personal thing.|Understand, Nick?<br> - A personal thing.|- Okay, Tom.<br> Personal.<br> But if I can get you transferred,|I can get you promoted, right?<br> So?<br> Just a thought.<br> - Lady, don't be difficult.|- Get your big paws off me, you...<br> - Who are you?|- I'm Irene Hayes.

And I'm going to marry her, too.<br> Now, listen, Joe.<br> "Now, listen, Joe."<br> Listen to yourself.<br> You'll never know what I've done|for that crazy kid.<br> Give him everything. Money, clothes, cars.<br> Made a gentleman out of him.|Sent him to four colleges.<br> Four!<br> The last one I had to buy a chair.|No, not like that.<br> Endowment, they call it.|Professors graft, and stiff, too!<br> I had to endow a chair in Civics|to get him his...<br> - What do you call it?|- Diploma.<br> Diploma. I got it, okay.<br> And I kept him out of the racket.<br> Why, he could marry anybody in town,|society people maybe, even.<br> Funny, eh?<br> - Personal you want to make it, right?|- I said my piece on that.<br> Well, listen.<br> Somebody better wise you up, McQuigg.|You're two administrations behind.<br> That district of yours, it's hot now!<br> The boys need it|with the election coming up.<br> What're you trying to do,|stand in the way of progress?<br> I tried to be nice about it|and give you a good steer.<br> You better get smart, Tom,|or start to duck.<br> Just stay out.<br> You're not going back|to the station tonight?<br> Yeah.<br> - I look for shenanigans.|- What kind?<br> Who knows?<br> The election's close.<br> Every two years an election.<br> Never seems to make much difference.<br> Now don't you be worrying, Mary.|It's just politics.<br> All right.<br> But you will be careful, Tom?<br> Careful?<br> Let the hoodlums be careful.<br> Are you all right, Mary?<br> - Was that just politics?|- Who knows?<br> - Are you sure you're all right?|- Positive.<br> - I'll take you to your sister's.|- You will not.<br> But, Mary...<br> Nobody's going to drive me out|of my own home in your district.<br> You're right, Mary.<br> Get on with your cleaning|and I'll get on with mine.<br> Well, boys?<br> Car 127 is following the car|that didn't look kosher.<br> Car came out of an alley|back of your house<br> right after the explosion.<br> - Drive me down to the station.|- Right.<br> Mosley, car 133.

Outrageous!<br> - You can count on my office.|- Where's Nick?<br> Nick?<br> You got evidence against Nick?<br> There's never any evidence against Nick.|The evidence always gets lost.<br> Witnesses disappear,|the record room has a fire.<br> We haven't even got a picture of him|in our files.<br> Kids like Johnson don't even know|his face.<br> No wonder the Governor appointed|a special crime...<br> - Well, none of this is evidence.|- Well, a confession will be.<br> Suppose you did pick him up,|he'd have a writ here in 10 minutes.<br> I'd like to spend 10 minutes|alone with Nick.<br> - You say yourself he's hiding.|- Not from the old man, he isn't.<br> You could find him.<br> I've never seen any connection|between them.<br> Oh, Welsh, this is me, remember?|McQuigg.<br> You can save that line for the voters.<br> Well, maybe after the election.<br> - There'll be one less honest judge.|- Now look here, Mac. That's pretty strong.<br> Welsh, there's decency in you.|Why don't you give it a chance?<br> The old man's making me a judge.<br> Convicting Nick Scanlon could make you|our next governor.<br> - No, Mac, you don't understand politics.|- All right, forget that.<br> Just between ourselves, tip me off.|It won't go any further. Where is he?<br> Mac, I don't know where he is.|Now, don't do anything reckless, Mac.<br> I'm conservative. You're the reckless one.|You're playing with fire.<br> - See if Johnson's still here, will you?|- Yes, sir.<br> - He'll never help you.|- He could be honest.<br> - Too much pressure from above.|- Well, I can add a little from below.<br> - The old man's behind him, Captain.|- Yes, sir.<br> He'll probably be at the Paradise Club|watching Irene Hayes.<br> - Yes, sir.|- Pick him up. Quietly.<br> - What's the charge, sir?|- Vagrancy.<br> - Yes, sir.|- If he resists,<br> there's a city ordinance against|expectorating on the public pavement.<br> That includes expectorating|broken teeth, sir?<br> Oh, yes, that's very unsanitary.<br> - Where did she telephone from?|- All I heard was the club, sir.<br> Then Mr. Joseph went out at once.<br> And then this perfectly ferocious man|came and roughed me up.<br> - What did he say?|- I hardly know, sir.<br> Then he...<br> - He what?|- Nothing, sir.<br> I tried to dissuade him, sir, but he was|an extremely determined person.<br> And I, Mr. Scanlon, wish to give notice.<br> You what?<br> I hardly know, sir.

Let's have it.|- Well, then...<br> - That thing's getting close.|- So?<br> This is McQuigg's district, you meathead.<br> It's gone right on past. Next street.<br> I was going to fire her,|just like you told me, Mr. Scanlon.<br> - Where'd they take Joe?|- 7th precinct.<br> How about the tommy?<br> She's on her way there now.|Walking, I think.<br> Cops got Joe, picked him up.<br> Now, we're going to pick up that tommy.<br> She's walking to the station,|probably took the shortest way.<br> You see, he was my sergeant.<br> He really looked after us,|kind of like an older brother.<br> Sounds like a scoutmaster.<br> You sure you were in the Marines?<br> Got an honorable discharge that says so.<br> Good. I hope your cop friend's got one.|Maybe they'll take him back.<br> Oh, no, no, no. He's married now and...<br> You mean that guy could get him fired?<br> Why don't we talk about you?<br> Why me? Why not you?<br> So you used to catch my act every night.<br> All I can say is you've got no ear for music.<br> It wasn't your singing.<br> Well, at least the boy is frank.<br> No, no, no, I don't mean that. I mean...<br> Stick to the newspaper business.|Stay out of nightclubs.<br> You might get your feelings hurt.<br> - What's your first name?|- Dave.<br> You like the newspaper business, Dave?<br> - You like nightclubs?|- No, I don't.<br> But I like to eat three times a day.<br> There she is.

The old man...<br> When I say do something, I want it done.<br> When are you guys gonna learn?<br> After this, don't argue.<br> Throw him in the back.<br> Okay, let's get out of here.<br> I guess we're done for the evening.<br> This is where I leave you. Thanks.<br> Oh, I'm going in, too.|You forget, I'm a reporter.<br> The only thing is, why are you going in?<br> We brushed that off a while back.<br> Don't play Romeo.|It's just a waste of time, believe me.<br> Receipt for your toys, sonny.<br> My granddaughter could use that|for a paperweight in her kindergarten.<br> Grand larceny and concealed weapons.|That's a good pinch, Johnson.<br> I don't admit stealing that car.<br> No, we just stole one of the three|Rolls-Royces in the city<br> and planted it on you.<br> Maybe a jury will give you damages.<br> You'll see who gets damaged.<br> Now, sonny,|you mustn't terrorize the police.<br> Come see the birdie, pretty boy.<br> Face to the front. That's it.<br> What's the trouble, Captain?<br> - It doesn't involve you, I hope.|- Glad to hear it.<br> Except as a witness.<br> Irene, don't talk.|Nick'll have us out in an hour.<br> Quiet. Talking spoils my focus.<br> - Me witness against the Scanlons?|- You will, under oath.<br> I have memory lapses.<br> Miss Hayes, what have the Scanlons|ever done for you?<br> Nothing. But they will now.<br> Nick Scanlon never did anything|for anyone in his life,<br> except himself.<br> Or his brother.<br> You mean you want that punk?<br> You don't necessarily get|what you want in life,<br> I always say.<br> Irene, that depends on what you want.<br> City Press, sir.<br> He's a friend of mine, sir,|and another witness.<br> It's your duty as an honest citizen to try...<br> Who said I was an honest citizen?|And what would it get me if I was?<br> Well, it might keep you out of jail|for perjury.<br> This is great.|I walk in here of my own accord...<br> I'm only trying to help you.<br> Well, don't be so helpful.<br> I've been looking after Irene, that's me,|for a long time.<br> Lock her up.<br> - For what?|- Material witness.<br> I got a right to one phone call.<br> Captain, is our phone working?<br> For one call after they're mugged, yeah.<br> This is terrible, Captain.<br> Mr. Ames, I'm gonna have|to straighten you out.<br> All I'm after is Nick Scanlon.<br> Are you going to keep Miss Hayes in jail?<br> I wish I could,|but Nick'll have them both out<br> on a writ by midnight.<br> He was too smart to call Nick.<br> - Who did he call?|- Davis Bail Bonding Company.<br> See?<br> And, Captain, Davis stalled him.<br> Said he had no instructions|on Joseph Scanlon.<br> Where's Welsh?<br> I hope he's still out chasing votes.<br> Aren't they going to get Miss Hayes out?<br> It's an old trick, son. A writ's too public.<br> Welsh is working on the inside.<br> Just so somebody gets her out.<br> I'm holding Miss Hayes as a witness|against Scanlon.<br> - Is she in danger?|- Not while I'm holding her, she's not.<br> He's right, Dave.<br> - When's your next edition?|- About five hours.<br> Have Mike bring my car around, will you?<br> I'm going to see Judge Sherman.<br> Shoot the whole story, son.<br> Captain, can I leave her name out of it?<br> Sure, just be certain|my name is very prominent, understand?<br> I understand.<br> Hey, Tom, take it easy, will you?|They can bust you for this.<br> Let them bust.

It might help a lot.<br> Listen, maybe I better tell you|the facts of life.<br> The Captain's setting himself up|as a decoy, you understand?<br> - But, Bob...|- McQuigg plays rough. I like it.<br> As soon as that edition hits the street,|I'm expecting callers.<br> - But, look, Bob...|- Don't argue! Grab the phone.<br> Paper? Got your picture in it, Captain.<br> Thank you.<br> You should've been off hours ago.<br> How about yourself?<br> I got Judge Sherman.<br> They'll never fix him.<br> - The hearing's on Wednesday.|- Mac, how could you do this to me?<br> Convicting Joe Scanlon's gonna be|great publicity for you, Mr. Prosecutor.<br> Joe Scanlon is a boy,|an impetuous youngster.<br> Expressing his budding personality|by grand larceny?<br> Juvenile peccadillo.<br> The owner of that car will not file|a complaint.<br> Is the old man making him a judge, too?<br> He's a big contractor. He built city hall.<br> Yeah, I suppose he's the one|that gave Joe that pistol.<br> - Special permit can be issued.|- Dated last Christmas?<br> Look, the old man wants this settled.<br> Now, that's funny.|I heard there was no connection<br> between him and the Scanlons.<br> Mac, this could cost me my job.<br> Hello, Mac.|Mr. Welsh, Mr. Connolly wants you.<br> - Is he here?|- No, in his office waiting.<br> Well, did they make you city editor|or give you some stock?<br> They threatened to fire me.<br> Oh? So what?<br> I'm worried about that girl.<br> - Ames, how old are you?|- 23.<br> That's very proper.|That's the right age to worry about girls.<br> - The paper wants her name.|- Fine publicity for her.<br> If you stigmatize a girl's good name...<br> People just don't change good names|to Scanlon.<br> She's just young and mixed up.<br> Captain, can I see her?<br> Send Miss Hayes up here, please.<br> And while we're trying to find you,<br> McQuigg sets the hearing|with Judge Sherman.<br> I was working for the election.<br> You may not be in the election.<br> - I insist on seeing the old man.|- He's not in.<br> - But the Scanlon boy is guilty.|- I can't help that.<br> Connolly, do we need Nick Scanlon now?<br> Yeah.<br> Nick, I was just joking.<br> I can get Joe out on a writ.<br> Any fool can do that.<br> But unfortunately, he is guilty.<br> Why does the old man want to make|this dummy a judge?<br> Let's stick to business, Nick.<br> My brother is my business.<br> Listen, Judge.<br> According to your law books,<br> no man is guilty|until convicted in a fair trial, right?<br> My brother will never come to trial.<br> Nick, that cop caught him with a gun!<br> - What was that cop's name?|- Johnson. It's in all the papers.<br> Johnson will not appear.<br> The old man won't like that, Nick.<br> And there's this girl.<br> - Girl?|- Yeah.<br> She stole that car to frame my brother.<br> And you, Mr. Prosecutor,<br> you'll send her where she can't get him|in any more trouble.<br> Oh, wait, Nick, Connolly...<br> You want to be a judge|or an ex-prosecutor?<br> Well, if it's for the good of the party.<br> You get your case.|Get it ready against that dame.<br> Let me know how many witnesses|you'll need.<br> Davis.<br> The old man must like them weak.<br> The old man likes them pliable, Nick.|He likes men who do as he says.<br> The other kind don't last long.<br> Davis Bail Bonding Company,|a Delaware corporation.<br> What took you so long?<br> Well, there's only one judge|who will touch this.<br> Did you get the writ?<br> Yeah, signed by Judge Wicks.|All we do is fill in the date.<br> Bring it here.<br> Give me your pen.<br> But I promised to get her out.<br> But Nick didn't. He means it, Joe.<br> Now wait a minute, Davis.<br> Okay, good luck at the trial.<br> Davis.<br> Okay, get me out.<br> - You got the story straight?|- Sure. Serves her right.<br> Don't put that in your pocket.<br> - Why not?|- It'll stink up your clothes for a week.<br> Nick will have us out in an hour.<br> What do you want, my phone number?<br> You're staying here.<br> - Didn't he just bail us out?|- Not you.<br> When do I get out?<br> What is auto theft now, Lieutenant?|Five years?<br> Drop me a line from the pen.<br> You wait. I'll tell them the truth.|The whole business!<br> I'll give them the works, everything,|even about Higgins!<br> You'll be sorry for this.<br> I'll bust the thing wide open,|do you hear me? Wide open!<br> She's just young and mixed up.<br> - So you lost your playmate, huh?|- Yeah, I picked up his jacks.<br> - What happens now?|- That depends on you.<br> - Can they really frame me?|- If you play their game, they can.<br> What game are you playing?<br> Just one. I want Nick Scanlon.<br> What can I do?<br> Tell me about Higgins.<br> For what?<br> You want to spend|the rest of your life here?<br> Last night, when he was sore,<br> Joe was bragging that Nick got Higgins.<br> How? Who was it that shot Higgins?<br> - That's all he said.|- Come on, sister.<br> That's all he said, honest.|He knows all about it.<br> Either Nick told him|or he overheard what was going on.<br> Well, it's a little thin,|but pick Joe up again.<br> Well, I'll be getting along.<br> To a slab in the morgue?<br> - They won't bother me, will they?|- Not in here, they won't.<br> Feed her and make her comfortable,|but don't let her out of your sight.<br> Irene, I'm sorry.<br> Get out before you get me hung|with your honesty.<br> You seem awfully anxious to get rid of me.<br> Well, I'm anxious for the news.<br> Bob, are you really glad?<br> Darling, I hope it's twins.<br> Well, you know, Dr. Carter isn't sure yet.<br> You tell Dr. Carter|I already bought the cigars.<br> - What will you do while I'm gone?|- What does any father do?<br> Will you be at the station later?<br> Yeah, in an hour, biting my nails.<br> - I'll come straight there.|- Good.<br> Come in.<br> Bob, why won't McQuigg|release Irene Hayes?<br> Dave, you've got to grow up.|You're living in a dream world.<br> Well, what's wrong with trying to help|a girl that needs help?<br> McQuigg is helping her|to break with the Scanlons.<br> He's using her to catch Nick.<br> - Well, she won't be safe until he does.|- Oh, come on, Bob, you're exaggerating.<br> Well, there were three policemen killed|in this town last year<br> by the kind of people that play around|with the Scanlons.<br> Look, you know as well as I do that she...<br> Well, she just got mixed up in this|by accident.<br> She's not really the kind|who plays around with people like Nick.<br> Is Officer Johnson in?<br> We just came about his insurance.<br> Yeah, come in.<br> He's changing his clothes. I'll call him.<br> Bob?<br> Reach! High!<br> Bob?<br> You all right?<br> A confession would've been better.<br> I insist on seeing the old man.<br> All right, all right.
