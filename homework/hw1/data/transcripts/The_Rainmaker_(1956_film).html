Can you believe it?<br> Used to be 5.<br> Well, I don't suppose<br> you'd be interested<br> in renting this place<br> out now, would you?<br> I couldn't afford much,<br> though.<br> I could let you have it<br> quite reasonably<br> if you'd assist me with a few<br> chores around the place.<br> Sure, sure.<br> Perhaps a little weed pulling<br> now and then.<br> Sure. Weed pulling's<br> my specialty.<br> Go to hospitals<br> all the time.<br> Bruiser has contacts<br> down at the main precinct,<br> guys he grew up with.<br> They feed him accident<br> reports every morning.<br> Can I ask you<br> something?<br> Sure.<br> What does Bruiser<br> expect me to do?<br> Get the case.<br> You find the victims.<br> You sign 'em up to the law firm<br> of J.

Thank you.<br> Uh, your honor, I'd like<br> to turn the questioning<br> of Mr. Keeley over<br> to my partner Rudy Baylor.<br> [Whispering]<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> You don't have a license.<br> I didn't have a choice.<br> What are you doing?<br> You're late.<br> Good morning, your honor.<br> Sorry I'm late, sir.<br> Approach the witness,<br> your honor?<br> You may.<br> This is the claims manual<br> that was given to me<br> by Jackie Lemancyzk.<br> DRUMMOND: Objection,<br> your honor.<br> Stolen work papers.<br> Inadmissible.<br> You ruled on this.<br> KIPLER: Sustained.<br> May we approach?<br> DRUMMOND: I thought this matter<br> was already settled, your honor.<br> RUDY: Your honor,<br> I just this morning<br> found a case<br> that is controlled<br> in this<br> factual situation.<br> JUDGE KIPLER:<br> What do you have?<br> If you'll just take<br> a look at this ruling.<br> It's Club Ruby<br> vs. Carmine De Soto.<br> Copy for your honor<br> and one for Mr. Drummond.<br> Number 585,<br> southwest second, page 431,<br> argued by Bruiser...<br> by J. Lyman Stone.<br> And it shows very clearly<br> that stolen documents<br> are, in fact, admissible<br> if the lawyers played<br> no part in the theft.<br> Well, according<br> to these head notes,<br> this case will overrule<br> your objection.<br> Sorry, Leo.<br> Oh, I'm sure you are,<br> your honor.<br> But note<br> my strong objection.<br> Objection noted.<br> May I approach?<br> Do so.<br> Uh... Your honor...<br> Your honor, I'm sorry.<br> Excuse the interruption,<br> Mr. Keeley.<br> We were about<br> to talk about<br> the Great Benefit<br> claims manual.<br> Is that a complete Great Benefit<br> claims manual, sir?<br> Yes.<br> Does it have<br> a section "U"?<br> KEELEY: It has<br> a section "U" in it.<br> Well, let's talk about<br> this mysterious section "U."<br> Why don't we explain it<br> to the jury?<br> Take a look at it.<br> Just read paragraph 3.<br> "Claim handlers are directed<br> to deny all claims<br> "within 3 days<br> of receipt of claim.<br> No exceptions."<br> Now, how do you explain<br> this section "U"?<br> Well, sometimes<br> we get some frivolous<br> and fraudulent claims<br> in our business,<br> and sometimes we have to use<br> this kind of language<br> to focus in on<br> the legitimate<br> and more needy claims.<br> Mr. Keeley, do you honestly<br> expect this court<br> to believe that explanation?<br> Well, this chapter<br> merely denotes<br> in-house<br> processing guidelines.<br> In-house<br> processing guidelines.<br> No, Mr. Keeley.<br> No, it does not.<br> Section "U" does<br> a lot more than that.<br> I don't think<br> it does that, son.<br> Mr. Keeley, doesn't it<br> explain precisely<br> how claims should be routed<br> and shuffled and rerouted,<br> anything to avoid payment?<br> I admit nothing.<br> Your honor,<br> approach the witness?<br> You may.<br> Now, Mr. Keeley,<br> how many policies did<br> Great Benefit have in effect<br> in the year 1995?<br> I don't know.<br> Well, let's see.<br> Does the figure 98,000 sound<br> correct, give or take a few?<br> Maybe.<br> That could be right,<br> yeah.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, of these policies,<br> how many claims were filed?<br> Well, I don't...<br> I don't know that.<br> Does the figure of 11,400<br> sound correct to you,<br> give or take a few?<br> That's about right,<br> but I'd have to<br> verify it, of course.<br> I see. So the information<br> that I want<br> is right there in that book?<br> Yes.<br> Can you tell the jury<br> of the 11 some odd thousand<br> claims filed,<br> how many were denied?<br> I don't think I could.<br> That would take more time.<br> You've had 2 months,<br> Mr. Keeley.<br> Now answer the question.<br> Well, I...<br> I don't think...<br> Um...<br> "9,141."<br> [People Murmuring]<br> Your honor...<br> I have yet another document.<br> This is a report<br> from Great Benefit's<br> medical committee.<br> Request permission<br> under previous precedent<br> to present it to Mr. Keeley.<br> Same objection,<br> your honor.<br> Overruled.<br> Objection noted.<br> RUDY: Thank you.<br> Uh, Mr. Keeley,<br> that is a report<br> from Great Benefit's<br> own medical committee,<br> which you chaired.<br> Would you please read<br> from line 18?<br> "Since bone-marrow<br> transplants<br> "have become<br> standard procedure,<br> "Great Benefit would be<br> financially justified<br> in investing<br> in bone-marrow clinics."<br> Approach the witness,<br> your honor?<br> You may.<br> Thank you.<br> RUDY: There you go.<br> A little louder.<br> DRUMMOND: Objection,<br> your honor. Repetitious.<br> JUDGE KIPLER: Overruled.<br> I want the jury<br> to hear this.<br> KEELEY: "Since<br> bone-marrow transplants<br> "have become<br> standard procedure,<br> "Great Benefit would be<br> financially justified<br> in investing<br> in bone-marrow clinics."<br> Financially justified.<br> That's what it's all about<br> at Great Benefit, isn't it?<br> Tender the witness.<br> JUDGE KIPLER: Mr. Drummond.<br> No questions. We rest<br> on our objections.<br> You're excused, Mr. Keeley.<br> Thank you.<br> Rudy.<br> Hmm?<br> Come on. Get up.<br> Come on. It's time.<br> Let's go.<br> Come on, come on.<br> What will giving a judgment<br> of $10 million accomplish?<br> All insurance company premiums<br> will spin out of reach,<br> and it will pave the way<br> for government-controlled<br> health coverage.<br> Yours is<br> a grave responsibility.<br> Be wise,<br> be careful,<br> and be just.<br> Be just.<br> Thank you, your honor.<br> Mr. Baylor, your rebuttal.<br> RUDY:<br> Thank you, your honor.<br> Ladies and gentlemen<br> of the jury...<br> When I think<br> of Donny Ray Black...<br> Gasping for his last breath<br> of air and slowly dying...<br> I am disgusted<br> with myself...<br> And with the entire<br> legal profession<br> that could not save him.<br> I don't even feel good enough<br> about myself as a lawyer<br> to make my own summation.<br> So I thought I'd...<br> I'd let Donny Ray do that.<br> It's exhibit 16.<br> I weigh 110 pounds.<br> I weighed 160.<br> The leukemia was detected<br> in plenty of time.<br> I was in the hospital<br> being treated<br> when the doctors realized<br> that the only thing<br> that could save my life<br> would be<br> a bone-marrow transplant.<br> So, I got released<br> from the hospital,<br> 'cause my family<br> couldn't afford to pay<br> the bill for what<br> they had recommended.<br> Why?<br> Great Benefit insurance<br> denied our claim.<br> Come on.<br> DOT: It's OK.<br> If I had had<br> a bone-marrow transplant,<br> I would have had<br> a 90% chance of living.<br> RUDY: I hope that you are<br> astonished...<br> As I am,<br> at the lengths to which<br> a wealthy insurance company,<br> like the defendant,<br> will go to take money<br> from a low-income family<br> and then keep it<br> by denying<br> a legitimate claim.<br> It's no wonder they spend<br> so much money on their lawyers<br> and their lobbyists and<br> their public relations machine<br> to convince us we need<br> tort reform,<br> that we need to put an end<br> to punitive damages.<br> I'm asking you, the jury...<br> Just...<br> Do what you think is right<br> in your hearts.<br> If you don't punish<br> Great Benefit...<br> You could be<br> their next victim.<br> That's it.<br> Don't be nervous.<br> Has the jury<br> reached a verdict?<br> Yes, we have,<br> your honor.<br> Is it written on paper,<br> according to my instructions?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Please read the verdict.<br> "We, the jury,<br> find for the plaintiff<br> "and award actual damages<br> in the amount<br> of $150,000."<br> [People Murmuring]<br> "And we, the jury,<br> find for the plaintiff<br> "and award<br> punitive damages<br> in the amount<br> of $50 million."<br> [Deck Chuckles]<br> [Gavel Bangs]<br> CLERK: All rise.<br> These people were<br> trying to hide things<br> and trying to get away with<br> something they were, uh...<br> And they got caught at it.<br> MAN: Another remarkable<br> part of the story...<br> the lead attorney on the case<br> Rudy Baylor<br> was trying his first case.<br> That's a staggering verdict,<br> I think,<br> by anybody's estimation.<br> It's certainly<br> one of the largest...<br> Well, not bad<br> for a yard boy.<br> Well, it wasn't<br> that difficult, really.<br> We just had a great jury<br> is what we had,<br> and the facts<br> just fell into place.<br> $50 million<br> in punitive damages.<br> KELLY: $50 million?<br> RUDY: Yeah.<br> How much do you get?<br> You get right<br> to the point, don't you?<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's not what I meant.<br> I know you didn't.<br> We get 1/3, but the money's<br> not in the bank yet.<br> I'll see you later.<br> You gonna leave<br> this girl all alone?<br> Not for long.<br> Rudy. Rudy.<br> I've decided I'm gonna<br> put your name in my will.<br> Oh. You know what?<br> You are just too kind<br> to me, Miss Birdie.<br> Hot off the newswire.<br> "Mr. Wilfred Keeley,<br> CEO of Great Benefit,<br> "was detained<br> yesterday afternoon at JFK<br> "just after boarding a flight<br> bound for Heathrow.<br> "Traveling with his wife,<br> "they claimed to be sneaking<br> away for a quick holiday.<br> "However, they could not<br> produce the name of a hotel<br> anywhere in Europe..."<br> At which they were expected.<br> At 5 P.M. today,<br> insurance company Great Benefit<br> filed for protection<br> under the bankruptcy code<br> in federal court<br> in Cleveland.<br> Many states are now<br> investigating Great Benefit,<br> and a number of class-action<br> lawsuits have been filed.<br> [Telephone Rings]<br> Hello?<br> Rudy, Leo Drummond here.<br> It appears the company's<br> been looted.<br> I'm... I'm sorry, Rudy.<br> I wanted you to get<br> every penny of that money.<br> Everybody loses<br> on this one.<br> Wanted you to know.<br> Thank you, Mr. Drummond.<br> Great Benefit's like<br> a bad slot machine...<br> never pays off.<br> We should have<br> taken 175,000.<br> What the hell<br> were we thinking?<br> It just got all<br> twisted, didn't it?<br> This legal profession.<br> RUDY:<br> Every lawyer in America<br> is talking about me<br> right now,<br> but that doesn't exactly<br> make me feel<br> like a member<br> of the legal community.<br> I might be able<br> to go on practicing law<br> if I was working<br> with my whole heart,<br> but I can't do that<br> and cover Kelly.<br> And she's gonna need<br> a lot of cover for a while.<br> I still love the law.<br> I'll always love it,<br> but maybe I should be<br> teaching it<br> instead of practicing it<br> out here in the world.<br> I need time to work it out.<br> Great Benefit<br> has gone belly up.<br> Barring a miracle<br> way off in the distance,<br> we won't get a dime.<br> God.<br> You've put them<br> out of business, Dot.<br> One little woman<br> from Memphis, Tennessee,<br> bankrupted them<br> sons of bitches?<br> Oh.<br> [Chuckles]<br> I'm gonna go to Donny Ray's<br> grave tomorrow<br> and tell him all about it.<br> RUDY:<br> So, I guess Kelly and I<br> will be taking off<br> first thing in the morning.<br> We made history, Rudy.<br> You know that?<br> We can always brag.<br> Bye.<br> RUDY: There's no doubt<br> about it... I'm hot.<br> In fact, I'm so hot<br> after this case,<br> there's no place for me<br> to go but down.<br> See ya.<br> Every client I ever have<br> will expect this...<br> the same magic,<br> nothing less.<br> And I could probably<br> give it to them,<br> if it didn't matter<br> how I did it.<br> And then one morning,<br> I'd wake up and find<br> that I'd become Leo Drummond.<br> Now, you give me a call<br> when you pass the bar exam.<br> Yeah, piece of cake!<br> Every lawyer,<br> at least once in every case,<br> feels himself crossing a line<br> he doesn't really mean to cross.<br> It just happens.<br> And if you cross it<br> enough times,<br> it disappears forever.<br> And then you're nothing<br> but another lawyer joke,<br> just another shark<br> in the dirty water.<br>
