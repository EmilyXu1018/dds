I didn't mean to upset you.<br> You don't have the power to upset me.<br> You don't matter enough to upset me.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> I've never been with a woman before.<br> We've been together four weeks,<br> and I can't live without you.<br> I can't.<br> Even the thought of it kills me.<br> I sat in the second carriage<br> because I thought you might kiss me.<br> Kid, you thought<br> we could make love in a tram?<br> Is it true what you said?<br> That I don't matter to you?<br> Do you forgive me?<br> Do you love me?<br> - Do you have a book?<br> - Yes, I have.<br> I took one with me this morning.<br> - What is it?<br> - The Odyssey, by Homer.<br> It's my homework.<br> We're changing the order we do things.<br> Read to me first, kid.<br> Then we make love.<br> - [Michael] The Odyssey, by Homer.<br> - What's an odyssey?<br> A journey.<br> He sets out on a journey.<br> Good.<br> "Sing to me of the man, Muse<br> The man of twists and turns<br> Driven time and again off course<br> Once he had plundered<br> - The hallowed heights of Troy"<br> - Come here.<br> "He pressed<br> her hand to his lips.<br> She was dead.<br> Past all help, or need of it."<br> "I poked into the place a<br> ways, encountered a little open patch<br> as big as a bedroom,<br> all hung around with vines,<br> and found a man lying there asleep.<br> And, by jings, it was my old Jim.<br> 'When you landed,<br> I reckoned I could catch up with you<br> on the land without having to shout<br> at you. But when I see that house,<br> I begin to go slow."' [laughs]<br> "Lady Chatterley<br> felt his naked flesh against her<br> as he came into her.<br> For a moment,<br> he was still inside her..."<br> This is disgusting.<br> Where did you get this?<br> - I borrowed it from someone at school.<br> - Oh...<br> You should be ashamed.<br> Go on.<br> "'Billions of bilious blue blistering<br> barnacles in a thundering typhoon!<br> It is water!' 'But what on earth<br> did you expect it to be?"'<br> - Whiskey.<br> - "'Whiskey, by thunder, whiskey!'<br> 'Whiskey? Come now, captain,<br> you can't be serious."'<br> That's enough for today, kid.<br> I was wondering, do you think<br> you could get some time off?<br> Maybe we could go on a trip.<br> - What sort of trip?<br> - A cycling holiday.<br> Just two days.<br> I've got a guide book.<br> I've worked out the route.<br> Look. What do you think?<br> I think you like planning, don't you?<br> "I'm not frightened.<br> I'm not frightened of anything.<br> The more I suffer, the more I love.<br> Danger will only increase my love.<br> It will sharpen it.<br> It will give it spice.<br> I'll be the only angel you need.<br> You will leave life even more beautiful<br> than you entered it.<br> Heaven will take you back<br> and look at you and say,<br> 'Only one thing can make a soul<br> complete, and that thing is love."'<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - [woman] Excuse me.<br> - Hello.<br> Do you know what you'd like?<br> - Um...<br> - What are you having?<br> - You order.

In what way?<br> What were you expecting?<br> I thought it was exciting.<br> Exciting? Why?<br> Why did you think it was exciting?<br> Because it's justice.<br> Societies think they operate<br> by something called morality,<br> but they don't.<br> They operate by something called law.<br> You're not guilty of anything<br> merely by working at Auschwitz.<br> Eight thousand people<br> worked at Auschwitz.<br> Precisely 19 have been convicted,<br> and only six for murder.<br> To prove murder,<br> you have to prove intent.<br> That's the law.<br> The question is never was it wrong,<br> but was it legal.<br> And not by our laws, no.<br> - By the laws at the time.<br> - But isn't that...<br> - [Rohl] What?<br> - ...narrow?<br> Oh, yes. The law is narrow.<br> On the other hand,<br> I suspect people who kill other people<br> tend to be aware that it's wrong.<br> Miss Schmitz,<br> you're familiar with this book?<br> Miss Schmitz,<br> you're familiar with this book?<br> - Yes.<br> - Parts of it<br> have already been<br> read out in court.<br> It's by a survivor,<br> a prisoner who survived.<br> Ilana Mather.<br> She was in the camp<br> when she was a child, wasn't she?<br> - She was with her mother.<br> - [Hanna] Yes.<br> In the book,<br> she describes a selection process.<br> At the end of the month's labor,<br> every month,<br> sixty inmates were selected.<br> Picked out to be sent from<br> the satellite camp back to Auschwitz.<br> That's right, isn't it?<br> Yes, that's right.<br> And, so far,<br> each of your fellow defendants<br> has specifically denied<br> being part of that process.<br> Now, I'm going to ask you.<br> Were you part of it?<br> Yes.<br> So you helped make the selection?<br> - Yes.<br> - [judge] You admit that?<br> Then tell me,<br> how did that selection happen?<br> There were six guards,<br> so we decided we'd<br> choose ten people each.<br> That's how we did it every month.<br> We'd all choose ten.<br> Your fellow defendants<br> took part in the process?<br> We all did.<br> Even though they've denied it?<br> Saying "we," "we all"<br> is easier than saying "I," "I alone,"<br> isn't it, Miss Schmitz?<br> Did you not realize<br> that you were sending<br> these women to their deaths?<br> But they were new arrivals,<br> new women were arriving all the time.<br> So... the old ones had to make room<br> for the new ones.<br> - I'm not sure you understand...<br> - We couldn't keep everyone.<br> - There wasn't room.<br> - [judge] No.<br> But what I'm saying...<br> Let me rephrase.<br> To make room, you were<br> picking women out and saying,<br> "You, you and you have<br> to be sent back to be killed."<br> Well, what would you have done?<br> Should I never<br> have signed up at Siemens?<br> Ms. Mather,<br> they're ready for you now.<br> Go, go. Go, go, go.<br> - Where's Michael?<br> - I don't know.<br> In your book, you describe<br> the process of selection.<br> Yes.<br> You were made to work and then,<br> when you were no longer any use to them,<br> then they sent you back<br> to Auschwitz to be killed.<br> Are there people here<br> who made that selection?<br> Yes.<br> I need you to identify them.<br> Can you please point them out?<br> Her.<br> And her.<br> Her.<br> And her.<br> Her.<br> And her.<br> Thank you. Please continue.<br> Each of the guards would choose<br> a certain number of women.<br> Hanna Schmitz chose differently.<br> In what way differently?<br> She had favorites.<br> Girls, mostly young.<br> We all remarked on it.<br> She gave them food<br> and places to sleep.<br> In the evening,<br> she... she asked them to join her.<br> And we all thought...<br> Well, you can imagine<br> what we thought.<br> And then we found out she was making<br> these women read aloud to her.<br> They were reading to her.<br> At first, we thought this guard,<br> this guard is...<br> ...more sensitive,<br> she's more human, she's kinder.<br> Often, she chose the weak, the sick.<br> She picked them out.<br> She seemed to be protecting them almost.<br> But then she dispatched them.<br> Is that kinder?<br> I want to<br> move on now to the march.<br> As I understand it, you and your<br> daughter were marched for many months.<br> In the winter of 1944,<br> our camp was closed down.<br> We were told we had to move on.<br> But the plan kept changing every day.<br> Women were dying<br> all around us in the snow.<br> Half of us died on the march.<br> My daughter says in the book,<br> "Less a death march,<br> more a death gallop."<br> Please tell us about<br> the night in the church.<br> That night, we thought we were lucky<br> because we had a roof over our heads.<br> Go on.<br> We'd arrived in a village.<br> As always, the guards took the best<br> quarters. They took the priest's house.<br> But they let us sleep in a church.<br> There was a bombing raid<br> in the middle of the night.<br> The church was hit.<br> At first, we could only hear the fire.<br> It was in the steeple.<br> Then we could see burning beams...<br> ...and they began to crash to the floor.<br> Everyone rushed...<br> ...rushed to the doors.<br> But the doors had been<br> locked on the outside.<br> The church burned down?<br> Nobody came to open the doors?<br> Is that right?<br> Nobody.<br> Even though you<br> were all burning to death?<br> How many people were killed?<br> Everyone was killed.<br> But you survived?<br> Thank you.<br> I want to thank you<br> for coming to this country<br> today to testify.<br> I don't know. I don't know<br> what we're doing here anymore.<br> Don't you?<br> You tell us to think like lawyers,<br> but there's something...<br> disgusting about this.<br> - How so?<br> - This didn't happen to the Germans.<br> It happened to the Jews.<br> - What are we trying to do?<br> - We're trying to understand.<br> Six women locked 300 Jews in a church<br> and let them burn.<br> What is there to understand?<br> Tell me! I'm asking!<br> What is there to understand?<br> I started out believing in this trial.<br> I thought it was great.<br> Now, I think it's...<br> it's just a diversion.<br> Yes? Diversion from what?<br> You choose six women,<br> you put them on trial,<br> you say, "They were the evil ones,<br> they were the guilty ones."<br> One of the victims<br> happened to write a book.<br> That's why they're on trial<br> and nobody else!<br> Do you know how many camps<br> there were in Europe?<br> People go on about<br> how much did everyone know?<br> Who knew? What did they know?<br> Everyone knew!<br> Our parents, our teachers.<br> That isn't the question!<br> The question is,<br> "How'd you let this happen?"<br> Better, "Why didn't you<br> kill yourself when you found out?"<br> Thousands. That's how many.<br> There were thousands of camps.<br> Everyone knew.<br> Look at that woman.<br> - Which woman?<br> - The woman you're always staring at.<br> I'm sorry, but you are.<br> I don't know which woman you mean.<br> You know what I'd do?<br> Put the gun in my hand,<br> I'd shoot her myself.<br> Shoot them all!<br> Why did you<br> not unlock the doors?<br> Why did you not unlock the doors?<br> Why did you not unlock the doors?<br> I've asked all of you,<br> and I'm getting no answer.<br> Two of the victims are in this court.<br> They deserve an answer.<br> This is the SS report.<br> You all have copies.<br> The report which was written,<br> approved and signed by all of you<br> immediately after the event.<br> In the written report,<br> you all claim you didn't even know<br> about the fire until after it happened.<br> But that isn't true, is it?<br> Well?<br> It's not true.<br> - I don't know what you're asking.<br> - The first thing I'm asking<br> - is why didn't you unlock the doors?<br> - Obviously.<br> For the obvious reason.<br> - We couldn't.<br> - Why couldn't you?<br> We were guards.<br> Our job was to guard the prisoners.<br> We couldn't just let them escape.<br> I see. And if they escaped,<br> then you'd be blamed,<br> you'd be charged,<br> you might even be executed?<br> - [Hanna] No!<br> - Well, then?<br> If we'd opened the doors,<br> there would have been chaos.<br> How could we have restored order?<br> It happened so fast.<br> It was snowing. The bombs.<br> The flames... There were flames<br> all over the village.<br> Then the screaming began,<br> and got worse and worse.<br> If they'd all come rushing out,<br> we couldn't just let them escape.<br> We couldn't.<br> We were responsible for them!<br> So you did know what was happening?<br> You did know? You made a choice.<br> You let them die,<br> rather than risk letting them escape.<br> The other defendants have made<br> an allegation against you.<br> Have you heard this allegation?<br> They say you were in charge.<br> It isn't true.<br> I was... I was just one of the guards.<br> - She was in charge.<br> - [woman] She was!<br> - Of course she was.<br> - Did you write the report?<br> No. No. We all discussed what to say.<br> We all wrote it together.<br> She wrote the report.<br> She was in charge.<br> - [judge] Is that true?<br> - No.<br> - Yes, you did!<br> - Does it matter?<br> - She wrote it.<br> - [judge] I need a sample<br> - of your handwriting.<br> - My...<br> - My handwriting?<br> - Yes. I need to establish<br> - who wrote the report.<br> - I don't see how that's appropriate.<br> - 20 years have gone by.<br> - Take her paper. Approach the bench.<br> - Compare handwriting of 20 years...?<br> - [judge] Approach the bench.<br> I will not be overruled<br> in my own court.<br> I'm sorry...<br> I'd rather listen to you.<br> There's no need.<br> I wrote the report.<br> Silence, please.<br> Order!<br> You've been skipping seminars.<br> I have a piece of information.<br> Concerning one of the defendants.<br> - Something they're not admitting.<br> - What information?<br> You don't need me to tell you.<br> It's perfectly clear. You have a moral<br> obligation to disclose it to the court.<br> It happens this information<br> is favorable to the defendant.<br> It can help her case.<br> It may even affect the outcome,<br> certainly the sentencing.<br> - So?<br> - There's a problem.<br> The defendant herself is determined<br> to keep this information secret.<br> - [Rohl] A moment, please.<br> - Sorry.<br> What are her reasons?<br> Because she's ashamed.<br> Ashamed of what?<br> - Have you spoken to her?<br> - Of course not.<br> Why "of course not?"<br> I can't.<br> I can't do that.<br> I can't talk to her.<br> What we feel isn't important.<br> It's utterly unimportant.<br> The only question is what we do.<br> If people like you don't learn<br> from what happened to people like me,<br> then what the hell<br> is the point of anything?<br> Schmitz?<br> You have a visitor.<br> Quiet, please!<br> Gertrud Ballow.<br> Andreas Michael Springer.<br> Michael Berg.<br> Walter Sherman.<br> Time's up.<br> Are you coming in?<br> You took your time.<br> What is it?<br> Where are you going?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I need to sleep by myself.<br> I'll just be a minute.<br> - Nazi!<br> - Nazi whore!<br> Nazi!<br> Silence in the court.<br> Silence in the court.<br> All rise.<br> The court<br> finds guilty the defendants<br> Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,<br> Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva<br> and Andrea Lumen<br> of jointly aiding and abetting murder<br> in 300 cases.<br> The court finds guilty the defendant<br> Hanna Schmitz of murder in 300 cases.<br> The court sentences<br> Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,<br> Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva<br> and Andrea Lumen<br> to each serve a total sentence in prison<br> of four years and three months.<br> Hanna Schmitz,<br> in view of your own admissions<br> and your special role,<br> you're in a different category.<br> The court sentences the accused,<br> Schmitz, to imprisonment for life.<br> Where are we going?<br> I said I'll tell you when we get there.<br> - You told me you liked surprises.<br> - I like surprises.<br> She's grown, hasn't she?<br> I don't know. It's so long since<br> I saw her, Michael. How can I tell?<br> It's my fault.<br> We shouldn't have come unannounced.<br> Daddy's going to live<br> in his own house.<br> Mother, I'm afraid<br> I have some bad news.<br> Julia knows.<br> We've already told her.<br> Gertrud and I,<br> we are getting a divorce.<br> You don't come for your father's<br> funeral, but you come for this?<br> It's not easy<br> for me to visit this town.<br> - Were you really so unhappy?<br> - That's not what I'm saying.<br> - It's not what I meant.<br> - Well, then?<br> You mustn't worry about Gertrud.<br> I'm going to look after her.<br> She's already a state prosecutor,<br> so she earns far more than I do.<br> Michael...<br> ...I'm not worried about Gertrud.<br> I'm worried about you.<br> "Sing to me of the Man, Muse<br> The man of twists and turns<br> Driven time and again off course<br> Once he had plundered<br> the hallowed heights of Troy"<br> [guard] 215, mail.<br> Number?<br> Open it.<br> Testing, testing.<br> One, two, three. Testing, testing.<br> The Odyssey by Homer.<br> The Odyssey by Homer.<br> "Sing to me of the Man, Muse<br> The man of twists and turns<br> Driven time and again off course<br> Once he had plundered<br> the hallowed heights of Troy..."<br> "...to the house of death.<br> But they held fast in place,<br> hoping that others might still come.<br> Shades of famous heroes,<br> men who died in the old days<br> and ghosts of an even older age,<br> I long to see."<br> "Come, sheathe your sword,<br> let's go to bed together.<br> Mount my bed and mix<br> in the magic work of love.<br> We'll breed deep trust between us."<br> "Not for all the world, not until<br> you consent to swear, goddess,<br> a blinding oath you'll never<br> plot some new intrigue to harm me."<br> "Straightaway, she began<br> to swear the oath that I required.<br> Never, she would never do me harm.<br> And when she'd finished then, at last,<br> I mounted Circes' gorgeous bed."<br> "When young Dawn, with her<br> rose-red fingers shone once more,<br> they yoked their pair again,<br> and out through the gates<br> and echoing colonnade,<br> they whipped the team<br> to a run and on they flew,<br> holding nothing back, and the princes<br> reached the wheatlands..."<br> "...those purebred stallions...<br> ...as the sun sank..."<br> "...is my beginning."<br> "Truly, and I have to confess,<br> I am jealous.<br> It's true, till now..."<br> "Perfectly astonishing.<br> I've always said it was all tricks,<br> but he went to<br> sleep under my very eyes."<br> "He lifted a large newspaper<br> from the table<br> and began stamping his feet<br> and flourishing the newspaper<br> to drive Gregor back into his room."<br> "Zhivago... even a cake,<br> rather like a Baba au Rhum<br> known as a Zhivago bun.<br> At one time you only had to say<br> to your sleigh driver in Moscow,<br> 'Zhivago's.'

The. The.<br> The.<br> The.<br> - No letter?<br> - No letter. Sign.<br> - [woman on phone] You're Michael Berg?<br> - Yes.<br> Thank you for calling me.<br> You got my letter?<br> I have it here.<br> As I say, Hanna Schmitz<br> is coming up for release very soon.<br> Hanna has been in prison<br> for over 20 years.<br> She has no family.<br> She has no friends.<br> You're her only contact.<br> And I'm told you don't visit her.<br> No, I don't.<br> When she gets out,<br> she's going to need a job.<br> She's going to need somewhere to live.<br> You can't imagine how frightening<br> the modern world will seem to her.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> I have no one else to ask.<br> If you don't take<br> responsibility for her,<br> then Hanna has no future at all.<br> It's kind of you.<br> Thank you for letting me know.<br> - You're Michael Berg?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm Louisa Brenner. Good morning.<br> - How do you do?<br> - We were expecting you earlier.<br> I should warn you, for a long time<br> Hanna held herself together.<br> She was very purposeful. In the<br> last few years, she's different.<br> She's let herself go.<br> I'm taking you straight to the canteen.<br> They've just finished their lunch.<br> Table four.<br> You've grown up, kid.<br> I've got a friend who's a tailor.<br> He'll give you a job.<br> And I've found you somewhere to live.<br> It's a nice place.<br> Quite small, but it's nice.<br> - You'll like it.<br> - Thank you.<br> There are various social programs,<br> cultural stuff I can sign you up for.<br> And the public library is very close.<br> You read a lot?<br> I prefer being read to.<br> That's over now, isn't it?<br> Did you get married?<br> I did. Yes, I did.<br> We have a daughter.<br> I'm not seeing as much of her<br> as I'd like.<br> I'd like to see<br> a great deal more of her.<br> The marriage didn't last.<br> Have you spent time<br> thinking about the past?<br> - You mean with you?<br> - No.<br> No, I didn't mean with me.<br> Before the trial,<br> I never thought about the past.<br> I never had to.<br> Now?<br> What do you feel now?<br> It doesn't matter what I feel.<br> It doesn't matter what I think.<br> The dead are still dead.<br> I wasn't sure what you'd learned.<br> Well, I have learned, kid.<br> I've learned to read.<br> I'll pick you up next week, OK?<br> That sounds a good plan.<br> We can do it quietly,<br> or we can make a fuss.<br> Quietly.<br> OK. Quietly.<br> Quietly.<br> - Take care, kid.<br> - You, too. See you next week.<br> I've come to collect Hanna Schmitz.<br> Please. Please, take a seat.<br> She didn't pack.<br> She never intended to leave.<br> "The talk was that a new face<br> had appeared on the promenade,<br> a lady with a little dog."<br> She left me a message.<br> A sort of will.<br> I'll read the bit that concerns you.<br> "There is money in the old tea tin.<br> Give it to Michael Berg.<br> He should send it,<br> alongside the 7,000 Marks in the bank,<br> to the daughter who survived the fire.<br> It's for her.<br> She should decide what to do with it.<br> And tell Michael I said hello."<br> - Ms. Mather?<br> - Yes.<br> - You're Michael Berg.<br> - Yes.<br> I was expecting you.<br> - Please.<br> - Thank you.<br> So you must tell me, exactly what<br> brings you to the United States?<br> I was here already.<br> I was at a conference in Boston.<br> - You're a lawyer?<br> - Yes.<br> I was intrigued by your letter,<br> but I can't say I wholly understood it.<br> - You attended the trial?<br> - Yes. Almost 20 years ago.<br> I was a law student. I remember you.<br> I remember your mother very clearly.<br> My mother died in Israel<br> a good many years ago.<br> I... I'm sorry.<br> Go on, please.<br> Perhaps you heard.<br> Hanna Schmitz recently died.<br> She killed herself.<br> She was a friend of yours?<br> A kind of friend.<br> It's as simple as this.<br> Hanna was illiterate<br> for the greater part of her life.<br> Is that an explanation<br> of her behavior?<br> - No.<br> - Or an excuse?<br> No. No.<br> She taught herself to read<br> when she was in prison.<br> I sent her tapes.<br> She had always liked...<br> being read to.<br> Why don't you start<br> by being honest with me?<br> At least start that way.<br> What was the nature<br> of your friendship?<br> When I was young,<br> I had an affair with Hanna.<br> I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg.<br> And...<br> ...even if I could,<br> I'm not willing to.<br> I was almost 16<br> when I took up with her.<br> The affair only lasted a summer.<br> But...<br> But what?<br> I see.<br> And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge<br> the effect she'd had on your life?<br> She'd done much worse<br> to other people.<br> I've never told anyone.<br> People ask all the time<br> what I learned in the camps.<br> But the camps weren't therapy.<br> What do you think these places were,<br> universities?<br> We didn't go there to learn.<br> One becomes very clear<br> about these things.<br> What are you asking for?<br> Forgiveness for her?<br> Or do you just want<br> to feel better yourself?<br> My advice? Go to the theater<br> if you want catharsis. Please.<br> Go to literature.<br> Don't go to the camps.<br> Nothing comes out of the camps.<br> Nothing.<br> What she wanted...<br> What she wanted was<br> to leave you her money.<br> - I have it with me.<br> - To do what?<br> As you think fit.<br> Here.<br> When I was a little girl,<br> I had a tea tin for my treasures.<br> Not quite like this.<br> It had Cyrillic lettering.<br> I took it with me to the camp,<br> but it got stolen.<br> - What was in it?<br> - Sentimental things.<br> A piece of hair from our dog.<br> Some tickets to the operas<br> my father had taken me to.<br> It wasn't stolen for its contents.<br> It was the tin itself<br> that was valuable,<br> what you could do with it.<br> There's nothing<br> I can do with this money.<br> I give it to anything associated<br> with extermination of Jews,<br> then to me it seems...<br> ...like absolution, and that's<br> something I'm neither willing<br> - nor in a position to grant.<br> - I was thinking maybe<br> an organization to encourage literacy.<br> Good. Good.<br> Do you know if there<br> is a Jewish organization?<br> I'd be surprised if there isn't.<br> There's a Jewish organization<br> for everything.<br> Not that illiteracy<br> is a very Jewish problem.<br> Why don't you find out?<br> Send them the money.<br> Shall I do it in Hanna's name?<br> As you think fit.<br> I'll keep the tin.<br> Thank you.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - I thought you liked surprises.<br> I do. I do like surprises.<br> Hanna Schmitz.<br> Who was she?<br> That's what I wanted to tell you.<br> That's why we're here.<br> So tell me.<br> I was 15.<br> I was coming home from school.<br> I was feeling ill.<br> And a woman helped me.<br>
