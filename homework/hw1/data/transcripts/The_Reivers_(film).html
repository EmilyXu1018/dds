                        When I was young, I lived<br> in a town called Jefferson, Mississippi.<br> That was a long time ago.<br> Quite a few people took up the land<br> at a dollar an acre...<br> and married one another,<br> and produced children, and built houses.<br> There was some bragging and lying...<br> but on the whole, we were a pleasant<br> and courteous people...<br> tending to our own business.<br> It seems to me now that those days<br> were like an endless summer...<br> stored with pleasure in my memory.<br> I suppose it can be said<br> that I parted from my youth...<br> on a Saturday morning in the year 1905...<br> just before noon with the temperature close<br> to 100 degrees.<br> Boon!<br> Here it comes, Boon.<br> Better hurry up or you're gonna miss it.<br> I ain't gonna miss anything.<br> I'll beat you there, bub.<br> That was the summer my grandfather,<br> known to all of us as Boss...<br> had a vision of our nation's<br> vast and boundless future...<br> in which the basic unit<br> of its economy and prosperity...<br> would be a small mass-produced cubicle<br> containing four wheels and an engine.<br> So he bought one.<br> It was a yellow Winton Flyer.<br> As for my friend, Boon Hogganbeck...<br> he found his soul's lily maid...<br> the virgin's love of his rough<br> and innocent heart.<br> Hey, Boon. Does Boss know that you're...<br> splashing water on this thing<br> four or five hours every day?<br> You're gonna soak all the paint off it.<br> Step back, will you?<br> You're getting dust on the magneto.<br> It sure is pretty.<br> Hey, how do you start this thing?<br> What do you want to know for?<br> There's this lovely lady across town<br> who'd just sit up...<br> and take notice if I chugged up<br> in this thing.<br> She would, huh?<br> "Honey," I would say to her...<br> "your man has arrived."<br> I'm gonna show you what to do<br> and how to do it.<br> - First, you adjust the choke.<br> - Choke.<br> - Then you adjust the magneto.<br> - Magneto.<br> - Then you walk around to the front.<br> - The front.<br> - Then you give her a crank. You follow me?<br> - Nothing to it.<br> Now...<br> you step in...<br> readjust the magneto, readjust the choke.<br> And you ease her into gear.<br> You don't crunch it, now.<br> Just kind of easy-like, you know? All right?<br> Boon, when do you think I can have her?<br> String bean, you so much as lay a hand<br> on this automobile...<br> I'll jump down your throat<br> and tap dance on your lungs.<br> Hey, Boon.<br> Lucius, get back to that piano.<br> Get out of the way!<br> Come here, Ned.<br> Come back, you...<br> What are you doing, Boon?<br> I'm gonna find that son of a bitch,<br> Ned McCaslin, and I'm gonna kill him!<br> Look out! Watch out! Get out of the way!<br> Look out, there!<br> Oh, shit!<br> Point that thing down a little bit,<br> then stand still. You might do better.<br> Hey, that's not funny!<br> Boon!<br> Young man!<br> Stop that right this minute!<br> Come on, now!<br> Been a bit too lively this morning, Boon.<br> We'll take this matter off the streets.<br> - Well, I didn't...<br> - Quiet!<br> I've had my fill of both of you.<br> For 20 years...<br> you've been standing in front of me,<br> on this strip of carpet...<br> unwashed and unrepentant.<br> You...<br> wandering into our livery stable,<br> wiping your runny nose on your shirttails.<br> And you...<br> abandoned in my back yard...<br> squalling your lungs out in a wash bucket.<br> Did any man ever inherit<br> a more ill-assorted pair?<br> What was he doing out joyriding in my car?<br> Your car, Boon?<br> The family car.<br> Speaking of family,<br> I'm more part of it than he is...<br> seeing as how you and I had the same<br> great-granddaddy, Mr. Maury.<br> Let's don't bring that up again.<br> I've heard it 1,000 times.<br> But isn't my name McCaslin, same as yours?<br> Didn't your great-granddaddy,<br> Lucius Quintus McCaslin...<br> take a slave girl named<br> Aunt Molly Beauchamp, who beget Acey...<br> who beget Maydew,<br> my mother, and then me?<br> We're kin. Look in the family Bible.<br> It's all written down there.<br> You're there. I acknowledge it.<br> - You'll end up in the family graveyard, too.<br> - Quiet!<br> Now, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.<br> I'm going to put you both under bond<br> to keep the peace.<br> $100 each.<br> - Is that legal?<br> - Legal?<br> We can try. If it isn't, it had ought to be.<br> My mother's father, Grandfather Lessep...<br> died that year, at home...<br> in the same room, and in the same bed,<br> he had been born in.<br> We didn't fear death in those days,<br> because we believed that...<br> your outside was<br> just what you lived in and slept in...<br> and had no connection with what you were.<br> But we did take funerals seriously...<br> and so my family traveled to Bay St. Louis...<br> to see the old man ceremoniously<br> to his final rest.<br> I want the automobile locked<br> in the carriage house.<br> I don't want you to drive it while I'm away.<br> - You own it.<br> - You remember it.<br> Lucius, I don't believe we've ever<br> left you alone at home before.<br> However, I expect your behavior<br> will be a credit to the family.<br> Don't be rude to Callie,<br> and don't be advised by Boon.<br> He knows no obstacles, counts no costs,<br> fears no dangers.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - All aboard.<br> I know you're sometimes afraid<br> to sleep by yourself.<br> Don't be. Trust in the Lord.<br> He's up all night.<br> Why did we stop all the way out here for?<br> Take a deep breath.<br> Smell that east wind?<br> Somebody's cutting grass.<br> You know something?<br> I think I see some fuzz<br> popping out on your cheeks.<br> You're sure growing up. Won't be long until<br> you'll be stropping a straight razor.<br> Yeah, we'd better be getting on home.<br> Callie doesn't like to keep dinner waiting.<br> Yeah, you'll be shaving,<br> then you'll be smoking.<br> You smoked yet?<br> Once. I got sick all over<br> my Sunday School suit.<br> Well, there's other things that'll sit easier.<br> And you'll find them.<br> - Move over.<br> - What for?<br> Take the wheel. Drive. See what it feels like.<br> - Right now? You mean this minute?<br> - Hurry up, before I change my mind.<br> You look dandy, Lucius.<br> But sit up straight so you can see out.<br> Ready?<br> What if I was to wreck it?<br> We'd have to get us two tickets on a boat<br> and just head for China. That's what.<br> Now, put your hand here.<br> Take off the brake.<br> Let her rip!<br> Good.<br> - Enjoying yourself?<br> - Yeah.<br> How long do you estimate they'll be gone?<br> - Father said four days.<br> - Four days.<br> - That ought to be long enough.<br> - For what?<br> For two men in an automobile<br> to go to Memphis, Tennessee.<br> Have you ever heard real streetcar bells...<br> seen the inside of a penny arcade,<br> or looked inside of a tattoo parlor?<br> We could stay up all night, if you wanted to,<br> and come in at dawn.<br> Boss said we should take the automobile<br> home and lock it up.<br> I put a lot of store into what Boss says.<br> You know I do.<br> But if you ever want<br> to reach your manhood...<br> sometimes you gotta say goodbye<br> to the things you know...<br> and hello to the things you don't.<br> Watch it.<br> But, Aunt Callie, she changed her mind<br> at the station.<br> She told me to go up to my Uncle Ike's<br> and stay with him.<br> Nope. You're my business until<br> your mom gets back.<br> But she said I could, Callie.<br> Boon heard her.<br> The reason I'm telling you<br> is so you'll know where I am...<br> in case anybody should ask.<br> Please?<br> It's too hot to sit on anybody today.<br> If you've gotta go, go.<br> Make sure you get there before dark.<br> - More cane, please.<br> - Henry, Luke, more cane.<br> Now what was you saying, Lucius?<br> Tell it to me again, slowly.<br> I said, Callie's doing the housecleaning,<br> and I'd be underfoot...<br> so I'm supposed to stay<br> with either Cousin Zack or you.<br> But if it wouldn't hurt your feelings any,<br> I'd kind of like to stay with Cousin Zack.<br> See, he found this new fishing hole<br> he wants me to try.<br> If I know Zack,<br> that fishing hole ain't on his property.<br> You be careful you don't get<br> your pants shot off.<br> - All right.<br> - We'll see you, Boon.<br> You left Aunt Callie<br> to go out to Uncle Ike's...<br> to tell him that you're coming to me...<br> to tell me that you're going fox-hunting<br> for four days with Ned.<br> You're a regular Wandering Jew.<br> Is it all right?<br> If it's all right with your mama,<br> it's all right with me. Lucius!<br> She did say you could go, didn't she?<br> Remember, you're on your honor<br> while she's gone.<br> I know it. I wouldn't lie.<br> Put your cap on,<br> 'cause it's gonna be a hot one.<br> Well, I'll be damned.<br> Come on. Let's get away from here.<br> And so we were off.<br> And I had already told more lies<br> than I thought I was capable of inventing...<br> and I'd had them believed...<br> a fact which had me spellbound,<br> if not appalled.<br> How do you feel about things now?<br> I don't know yet.<br> We're going to have fun. I'm telling you,<br> we're gonna have a good time.<br> Maybe the best time of our whole lives.<br> When we get there, I want to drive her in.<br> All right, you'll do that.<br> Right across the Fourth Street bridge...<br> in front of all those hotels and right smack<br> into the center of town, okay?<br> Camptown ladies sing that song<br> Doo-dah! Doo-dah!<br> Camptown racetrack five miles long<br> Oh! The doo-dah day!<br> Gonna run all night!<br> Gonna run all day!<br> Gonna bet my money on a bob-tail nag<br> Somebody bet on the bay<br> You see, Boon knew something I didn't.<br> That the rewards of virtue...<br> are cold and odorless and tasteless...<br> and not to be compared...<br> to the bright and exciting pleasures<br> of sin and wrongdoing.<br> Camptown ladies sing that song<br> Doo-dah! Doo-dah!<br> Camptown racetrack five miles long<br> Oh! The doo-dah day!<br> - Gonna sing all night!<br> - Gonna run all day!<br> Bet my money on a bob-tail nag<br> Somebody bet on the bay<br> All right!<br> Now what the hell are you doing there?<br> - Singing.<br> - Out!<br> Hey, wait a minute. I'm going along.<br> You weren't invited.<br> If I wait till I'm invited,<br> I never will go nowhere.<br> And anyway, somebody with sense<br> has to be around to look after the boy.<br> - Oh, and that's you!<br> - Well, it ain't you.<br> I didn't get him to tell lies<br> all around the countryside...<br> and steal his granddaddy's automobile.<br> - Borrow.<br> - Whatever.<br> - It wouldn't hurt if he came along.<br> - It isn't gonna help either.<br> I've got a right to a trip,<br> same as you and Lucius.<br> I'm kin and you ain't.<br> - What'll you give?<br> - A packet of snuff.<br> - Don't use it.<br> - My pocket watch.<br> - It don't work.<br> - A wood-smoked ham.<br> - How many pounds?<br> - Ten.<br> Done.<br> Imagine me, a white man,<br> having to chauffeur a nigger to Memphis.<br> I thought for a minute that me and you<br> was gonna misunderstand one another.<br> Let's go.<br> And so we were three, three reivers,<br> hightailing it for Memphis.<br> Oh, "reivers"...<br> that's an old-fashioned word<br> from my childhood.<br> In plain English,<br> I'm afraid it meant "thieves."<br> ...had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o<br> and on that farm he had some chicks<br> ee-i-ee-i-o<br> and a chick-chick here<br> and a chick-chick there<br> here a chick, there a chick<br> everywhere a chick-chick<br> Look out!<br> Look at him. Sitting there<br> as innocent as a new-laid egg.<br> Who's he?<br> He's the son of a bitch<br> who takes that team...<br> and works this place like a patch<br> to keep it muddy.<br> Last year he charged me $2<br> to pull out my wagon.<br> $2? That sure beats cotton.<br> He ain't gonna get me this time.<br> This here is an 18-horsepower automobile<br> under us.<br> All right. Somebody give me some help here.<br> Don't look at me,<br> 'cause I don't know how to help.<br> I ain't learned that much<br> about automobiles yet.<br> Get out.<br> I'll just be in your way. I'll sit with Lucius,<br> so you'll have plenty of room.<br> You wanted a trip...<br> you got one! Now, get out!<br> Let Lucius get out. He's younger than me.<br> - He's gotta steer.<br> - I'll steer if that's all you want.<br> - Jump out, boy, and help Mr. Boon.<br> - Lucius, sit where you are.<br> I'm going over there<br> to get one of those poles...<br> and when I come back,<br> I ain't gonna stick it under the car.<br> This water's got dirt in it.<br> If there's one thing I hate,<br> it's dirt between my naked toes!<br> That's because your circulation<br> ain't roused up yet.<br> Don't worry, brightie-eyes, it will be.<br> All right, now, jam her under the axle.<br> Lucius, when she bites,<br> just take her on through.<br> One, two, heave!<br> Stop!<br> - Get up there.<br> - Here he comes now.<br> Get up there. Come on.<br> Good morning, boys.<br> Looks like you boys<br> about ready for me now, huh?<br> You look like a boy that knows<br> which end of a mule to hook to.<br> Get down and hook it yourself. Why the hell<br> else are we paying $2 for a hired expert?<br> Nope. That was last summer.<br> Dabbling in water has undermined<br> my system to where I come down...<br> with rheumatism if I so much<br> as spit on myself. Here.<br> - Now where you want me to hook it?<br> - I don't care, myself.<br> Hook it up to any part you want<br> to come out of the mud hole.<br> If you want it all to come out<br> at the same time, I'd say hook it to the axle.<br> Stop shoving.<br> You can watch it. Just watch it.<br> Okay. It's hooked.<br> - You all ready?<br> - Yeah.<br> By the way, I forgot to mention it.<br> So maybe I'd better.<br> Prices have doubled around here<br> since last year. It's $6 now.<br> Of course, maybe you'd rather walk back<br> to Jefferson than to pay two more dollars...<br> but maybe that boy<br> and that other fellow wouldn't.<br> That boy is just a child.<br> And surely for a child...<br> Walking back to Jefferson<br> might be lighter for him...<br> - but it won't be no shorter.<br> - All right! But what about this other one?<br> When you wash that mud off,<br> he ain't even white.<br> Son, both these mules are color blind.<br> Come on, Daisy, giddyup!<br> What did I tell you?<br> The highway to Memphis.<br> She's all yours.<br> Look.<br> Motorcycle.<br> Just don't get the idea<br> you're a 40-mile-an-hour railroad engine.<br> Let her rip.<br> Don't gawk, Lucius.<br> Concentrate on your driving.<br> Now, Lucius...<br> this is kind of...<br> a boarding house. You're gonna like it here.<br> I got a letter last week<br> from one of the girls...<br> One of the ladies that works...<br> That's staying here...<br> and she's got her nephew visiting her...<br> so you're gonna have somebody<br> to play with.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Don't mind me.<br> And, it's usually pretty lively here,<br> with conventions and things.<br> But it's quiet now, 'cause it's Sunday.<br> Maybe they've all gone<br> to early prayer meeting.<br> No, I don't think so.<br> They're probably resting.<br> From what?<br> All right. Out. Come on, get out.<br> If you figure on going home<br> with us tomorrow...<br> you be here at the stroke of 8:00<br> tomorrow morning.<br> I mean the first stroke, 'cause I ain't<br> gonna be here to hear the last one.<br> If you can finish your business<br> by 8:00 in the morning...<br> how come you think I can't, either?<br> Lucius...<br> here, you keep this for me.<br> I may lose it someplace.<br> Now, when I need some,<br> I'll tell you how much to give me on it.<br> - Hi, Minnie.<br> - Hi.<br> Why, it's Boon Hogganbeck,<br> with a little blue-eyed child in tow.<br> Come in, Boon.<br> Lucius. This is Miss Reba,<br> so make your manners.<br> - How do you do, ma'am?<br> - I'll be damned. Did you see that, Minnie?<br> But I don't know what to say to you.<br> Our Mr. Binford has strong feelings<br> against having children on the premises.<br> He says they'll be in here<br> soon enough anyway.<br> So why not wait until they have some jack...<br> and are capable of spending it?<br> - Do you want me to tie him out in the yard?<br> - No, of course not.<br> We'll see if we can find<br> a little corner for him.<br> Now you both go up,<br> and take a nice, warm, sudsy bath...<br> and we'll see what we can work out.<br> Minnie, go up and tell everybody...<br> to stay out of the bathroom<br> for the next half an hour.<br> Where's Corrie?<br> She's in the parlor, changing the piano rolls.<br> - Hello, Boon.<br> - Hi, kiddo.<br> Lucius, come on down here, honey.<br> I'd like you to meet someone.<br> Corrie, watch this.<br> Lucius, this is Miss Corrie.<br> How do you do, ma'am?<br> What do you think of that?<br> - All right. Go get cleaned up, now.<br> - Go on, Lucius.<br> I'm not gonna roll around...<br> I am not gonna roll around<br> in any bed with you...<br> and let you nibble my ear,<br> and tell me silly things.<br> I'm staying with my plan.<br> Your plan is crazy.<br> Always was, always will be.<br> There's nothing crazy about it.<br> My sister Alice is married<br> and has three children.<br> My cousin Edith is married<br> and she's got four children.<br> I'm the last one on the vine.<br> You still think you'll get married<br> out of here...<br> with all those girls standing<br> in their underwear...<br> throwing rice at you<br> as you go out the front door?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Excuse me for saying so, honey...<br> but keeping a hope chest in a cathouse<br> is the dumbest thing I've heard.<br> Not every man's like you, Boon.<br> Some men come to women<br> for comfort and gentleness.<br> They want to talk about their troubles.<br> I listen and they like me.<br> My hope is that one day,<br> one of them will like me enough.<br> We know one thing, don't we, Boon?<br> It won't be you, will it?<br> All I want to do is just spend a dollar<br> and have some fun. Any crime in that?<br> Boon...<br> you can't be greedy<br> about Corrie's time this trip.<br> We've got a lot of conventions in town.<br> Policemen, firemen, Elks.<br> We're gonna be real busy.<br> Go up and take a nice cold bath<br> and cool yourself down.<br> Then come back and show us<br> how handsome you are.<br> Guess you never saw anything<br> like that before.<br> Yes, I have.<br> You have?<br> Mrs. Fletcher down the block.<br> She forgot to put down<br> her window shades one night.<br> It's a mystery, that's for sure.<br> It's all a mystery.<br> Come on.<br> I'll dry between your shoulder blades.<br> I guess you and I have been friends<br> ever since we've known each other.<br> From the time I carried you<br> around on my back in the livery stable...<br> to holding you<br> on the first horse you ever rode.<br> I guess that's right.<br> And here you are:<br> A night away from your mama's house...<br> you've learned to drive an automobile<br> for the first time...<br> and your first trip into the big city.<br> Any boy that's done all that...<br> can handle anything.<br> Like what, Boon?<br> You'll notice that there are a lot of<br> ladies staying at this boarding house.<br> Don't any men live here?<br> Don't know any men actively live here,<br> except Mr. Binford.<br> Just men visiting their lady folks,<br> kind of quiet and polite-like.<br> - You follow me?<br> - I will if you'll just get on with it.<br> All right.<br> Then here it is.<br> Folks back in Jefferson would say<br> you're not old enough to know these things.<br> I say you are.<br> I say there's some things a boy can learn...<br> that he never even knew about before.<br> So later on in life, when he needs them,<br> he's already got them.<br> See, ain't nothing you don't learn,<br> that later on you might need.<br> And when that day comes...<br> you can thank your lucky star<br> that your good friend Boon helped you.<br> Does that make any sense to you?<br> Some.<br> Some is good enough for the time being.<br> I went back to see Mrs. Fletcher again...<br> and her husband came out on the porch<br> with his bulldog.<br> Be sure and say please and thank you<br> when they pass things.<br> Otis, I told you not to do that!<br> - Boon!<br> - Hello, Boon.<br> - How are you?<br> - Ladies, this is Lucius.<br> - Well, hello, Lucius.<br> - Isn't he adorable?<br> Lucius, I want you to meet Otis,<br> Miss Corrie's nephew.<br> How do you do?<br> I do just fine if I'm left to it.<br> Our Mr. Binford should be<br> with us any moment.<br> He doesn't like us to begin without him.<br> He's probably waxing his mustache<br> to keep it up out of the soup.<br> That'll do, Otis!<br> Dinner's getting cold and I'm getting hungry.<br> That's his step now.<br> Ladies and gents all...<br> hash time.<br> Evening, Boon.<br> Evening. This is a friend of mine.<br> Lucius Priest McCaslin.<br> How do you do, sir?<br> I hurried as fast as I could.<br> And I'm not late am I, Mr. Binford?<br> Your hopes are dashed because you are.<br> That'll cost you 25 cents in the box.<br> I don't think that's fair. Miss Reba?<br> Those are the house rules, Phoebe.<br> A house without rules is not a home.<br> - Damn it, I...<br> - The trouble with you bitches...<br> is that you got to act like ladies<br> sometimes, but you don't know how.<br> - I'm learning you how.<br> - Mr. Binford, I don't think that's fair.<br> - I really don't. I figure if you want to...<br> - You put two bits in the box and sit.<br> So we can get some peace around here.<br> All right now, Miss Reba,<br> tell Minnie to get some beer.<br> Minnie, bring some beer.<br> How about some beer, boy?<br> You a beerhead?<br> No, sir. I don't drink beer.<br> - He drinks beer. Don't you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I drink anything that's put in front of me.<br> You hear that? Now, don't you like it?<br> Or can't you get it?<br> I'm not old enough yet.<br> Whiskey, then.<br> No, sir. I don't drink anything.<br> See, I promised my mother I wouldn't<br> unless Father and Boss invited me.<br> Who is this Boss?<br> He means his grandfather.<br> He tells you what to do and you do it.<br> - Sounds like you call him Boss, too?<br> - That's right.<br> Boss isn't here now. Your mother isn't here.<br> You're out on a tear with Boon.<br> Your folks are 80 miles away.<br> Here, you can have some.<br> No, sir, I promised her.<br> I see.<br> You promised her<br> you wouldn't go drinking with Boon?<br> Didn't promise her<br> you wouldn't go whore-hopping?<br> What the hell kind of language is that<br> to use in front of a child?<br> Lady, use your mouth<br> to eat your supper with.<br> Move over, and leave room for Otis.<br> I'll bet you got in that bed<br> without brushing your teeth.<br> I didn't bring anything to brush them with.<br> You neglect your teeth<br> and you'll end up with a denture...<br> floating in a water glass by your bedside.<br> They'll snap at you in the night, too.<br> Come on.<br> One thing I know is boys.<br> I got eight brothers<br> from 14 on down, like steps.<br> And my favorite one<br> is just your age and size.<br> His name is Ben.<br> I don't have any brothers or sisters.<br> I'll take you on<br> if you don't cause me too much trouble.<br> How'd you like that?<br> I guess it would be all right.<br> Do you miss your mama?<br> I started to after supper.<br> Does she tuck you in at night?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Don't be sad,<br> 'cause I'm gonna tuck you in tonight.<br> Sleep tight. And don't let the bedbugs bite.<br> Good night.<br> - Hello, Mr. Heasley.<br> - Hello, Minnie, how are you?<br> You devil.<br> Miss Reba, Mr. Heasley.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Listening.<br> What are you listening...<br> The money that's here.<br> You can just smell it.<br> It ain't right. It's just women<br> can make money pugnuckling.<br> What's pugnuckling?<br> Don't you know anything?<br> Even if I could get a drill<br> and drill a peephole...<br> Miss Reba wouldn't let me bring<br> anybody up here to make any money off of.<br> How are you gonna make money<br> by drilling a hole in the floor?<br> - How old are you?<br> - Eleven.<br> - Where'd you say you come from?<br> - Mississippi.<br> No wonder you don't know nothing.<br> Here, get this for me, will you?<br> You know what a whore is?<br> - Yes.<br> - What is it?<br> They got some in the Bible,<br> like the one from Babylon.<br> I got one from Kiblett, Arkansas.<br> My Aunt Corrie.<br> - Are you saying that she's one?<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> That's a lie!<br> Hell, I had a peephole drilled<br> in the back of the barn, with a tin...<br> - You're lying, aren't you?<br> - You're crazy.<br> She isn't.<br> She's not!<br> - Easy.<br> - His hand! He's hurt his hand.<br> You march out,<br> and stand in the hall till I come out...<br> - and don't you budge either!<br> - He cut you good.<br> Oh, sweetheart.<br> Now, sweetie, this is gonna sting.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Sit down.<br> - All right, what was it?<br> - I told him what you are.<br> You are, ain't you?<br> What were you two boys fighting about?<br> Nothing.<br> Leave me alone.<br> Eleven years old and already cut up<br> in a whorehouse brawl.<br> Come on, son.<br> Get in bed.<br> If you think you're gonna heave,<br> let me know and I'll get a towel.<br> I'm not gonna heave.<br> I'll stay with him for a while.<br> You don't have to do that.<br> I'm not a bit sleepy,<br> I'll just keep you company.<br> Why don't you go downstairs<br> and get him a nice glass of cold milk?<br> - Where's it at?<br> - In the ice chest.<br> Now...<br> Let me see that.<br> I made Otis tell me.<br> I've had people fighting over me before...<br> but you're the first one<br> who ever fought for me.<br> I don't know what I'm gonna do about that.<br> What am I gonna do about it, Lucius?<br> I don't know.<br> You'd make a good nurse.<br> All right.<br> You promised your mama not to drink...<br> and you kept it.<br> So, I'll promise you...<br> and I'll do my solemn best to keep it, too.<br> I promise.<br> Promise what?<br> - I'm quitting, Boon.<br> - You're what?<br> I'm quitting. Not anymore. Never.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I've made up my mind.<br> Why do you have to pick me out<br> to reform on?<br> Boon!<br> - I'm not.<br> - Sure you are!<br> And you can't quit for private reasons,<br> I love you too much.<br> - Boon Hogganbeck!<br> - Who's hollering?<br> Boon Hogganbeck, get on up in there,<br> I wanna talk to you!<br> Boon!<br> What do you want?<br> I want you to see this horse.<br> All right, I see it. What about it? I'm busy.<br> It's ours.<br> Yeah?<br> - Where'd you get a horse this time of night?<br> - I swapped for him.<br> What have you got to swap?<br> You don't own nothing...<br> except the suspenders<br> holding up your pants.<br> I had something that somebody wanted.<br> And what could that be?<br> - The automobile.<br> - Which automobile?<br> How many automobiles we got?<br> Boss' automobile.<br> What is it, a raid?<br> Gentlemen, there's nothing<br> to be excited about.<br> Just a little upset, that's all.<br> Good God Almighty.<br> Come right back in.<br> Minnie, take care of the gentleman.<br> His name's Lightning.<br> Ned, what the hell have you done?<br> Now, take it easy and listen to me.<br> This horse is gonna save us.<br> The only chance we've got with Boss<br> for stealing his automobile...<br> is to bring him back something that he likes<br> better than an automobile, which is a horse.<br> And I got you one.<br> Where does that man live? Because I want<br> to get that automobile back now!<br> We can't get it back, so don't go running<br> wild down the road looking for the man.<br> Let him alone. We don't want him yet.<br> We won't need him till after the race.<br> Race?<br> We ain't just got us a horse...<br> that man that I traded with<br> threw in a horserace, too.<br> Sweet Jesus!<br> He's got another horse waiting in Possum<br> right this very minute...<br> to run against this horse,<br> as soon as we get him there.<br> Don't you worry yourself none.<br> We're gonna take this horse<br> to my uncle's place in Possum...<br> and we're gonna win that automobile back.<br> How we gonna get it back?<br> - You just traded the horse for it.<br> - Lucius, my boy...<br> I got that man<br> to put the automobile up as a prize...<br> because he doesn't believe<br> that our horse can run.<br> And do you know why?<br> Because our horse has already been<br> beat twice by his Possum horse.<br> We're dead. Finished!<br> Oh, no, we ain't.<br> We ain't even started yet.<br> That man saw my toes<br> sticking out of my shoes...<br> and thought that all<br> I could do was shuffle dust.<br> He thought that because he couldn't make<br> this horse run, nobody could.<br> But, when it comes to horses...<br> no man alive can sting me.<br> I can take one whiff of a horse...<br> and know I got a good one.<br> And this is a good one.<br> Is that animal stolen?<br> No, sir, he ain't.<br> I wouldn't put no<br> stolen horseflesh in your stable.<br> - Who's gonna ride him?<br> - He is.<br> That boy ain't got but one hand.<br> He don't need but one hand.<br> This boy here learned holding on...<br> riding his daddy's colts back in Mississippi.<br> He can stick on anything.<br> Well, let's go and see.<br> As far as Ned was concerned,<br> we didn't have to see.<br> He was absolutely sure<br> that we'd go home to Boss...<br> with the automobile<br> and a good horse tied behind it...<br> and we'd be able<br> to look him in the eye again.<br> That track that he's gonna be running on<br> ain't but half-mile.<br> So you go around here twice...<br> so that when he sees that real track,<br> he'll know beforehand...<br> what to expect and to do.<br> Do you understand?<br> - Yes.<br> - Let's do it.<br> What's the matter?<br> Come on.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - He feels funny.<br> What do you mean, "funny"?<br> The front half of him<br> just doesn't want to go.<br> His legs feel all right...<br> but his head<br> just doesn't want to go anywhere.<br> All right.<br> You're the fool who traded<br> a 40-mile-an-hour automobile...<br> for him, now, what's the matter with him?<br> Maybe something distracted his mind...<br> maybe he ought to be run up<br> against another horse.<br> Maybe.<br> Come on, Lightning!<br> What is he? Is he blind? Is he lame?<br> - Is he old?<br> - He's slow.<br> Giddyup, there!<br> Come on, boy.<br> Boss gave me his blue serge suits<br> before they were even wore out.<br> He gave me his best boots.<br> He paid to have my appendix took out.<br> Boon!<br> Oh, my God!<br> I don't know what I'm trying<br> to kill myself for.<br> You're the one that got us into this mess.<br> Name's Lovemaiden. Butch Lovemaiden.<br> I'm sheriff of this here town.<br> Good morning to you.<br> Little boy, come here.<br> Come on.<br> You look like a nice little boy.<br> How'd you like to go over<br> to Uncle Possum's melon patch...<br> and bring me a nice ripe melon?<br> You bring me a salt shaker, hear?<br> I take it with salt.<br> I'm a nosy old coot.<br> When strangers show up, I do, too.<br> You ask old Possum Hood, there.<br> Old Possum Hood knows me.<br> Don't you, Uncle?<br> Everybody around here knows you,<br> Mr. Butch.<br> A lady woke me up early this morning...<br> told me about you folks leading a horse<br> down the main street of our town.<br> Said there was a little boy...<br> a pretty girl...<br> a nigger, and a Mississippi swamp rat.<br> I figured that was worth<br> rolling out of bed to see.<br> What brings you?<br> We got us a horserace fixed up.<br> Folks don't come much to Possum<br> no more for horseracing.<br> They all go to Iuka...<br> or Raleigh, the Ozarks...<br> Well, we come here.<br> Now, here's my melon.<br> Did you thump it?<br> Yes, sir, it's ripe.<br> Green ones gives me gas.<br> You care for some, little lady?<br> - No, I don't.<br> - No, you don't.<br> Thank you just the same.<br> Ain't that what you meant?<br> I just meant what I said.<br> Come on over here, honey.<br> Ain't we met up somewhere before?<br> Now that I study you some...<br> wasn't it over at Mr. Binford's cathouse<br> down in Memphis?<br> Ain't you the one<br> with the little strawberry mole...<br> right below your bellybutton?<br> You know something,<br> you're beginning to get my goat.<br> Don't. Uncle Possum's gotta live here.<br> - Don't, Boon.<br> - Wait!<br> That's right, Sugar Boy. He does.<br> All I have to do...<br> is go back in town, go in the barber shop...<br> say I saw Old Man Possum here...<br> with a white lady.<br> Why, in 10 minutes,<br> half the town would be out here crawling...<br> among the bushes. Whiffing, sniffing...<br> like hunting dogs after a stump.<br> Be seeing you, little lady.<br> Good morning to you.<br> He drove away, but I could still smell him...<br> his sweat souring the summer day.<br> I was tired and my hand hurt...<br> and I felt ashamed<br> and afraid for Uncle Possum.<br> There are conditions in the world...<br> which should not be there, but are.<br> But I hated having to learn about them.<br> I was just 11, remember.<br> Healing up real good.<br> I'm gonna fix you up<br> so you can ride a good race.<br> Can you fix a horse?<br> Depends. What's he need?<br> A miracle.<br> - Against the law around here.<br> - That's what I figured.<br> You and your wife got a fine boy here.<br> Not my wife. I ain't married.<br> Who does this pretty little lady belong to?<br> Myself.<br> You know, young lady,<br> your color ain't none too good.<br> I bet you're anemic.<br> I'm gonna have to listen to your chest.<br> - Am I all right?<br> - You're lovely, just lovely.<br> What's going on there? There's nothing<br> wrong with her chest. Let's get out of here!<br> Just a minute, Boon. We have to pay him.<br> - How much do we owe you?<br> - Nothing in cash.<br> But if you had a handkerchief<br> or something personal.<br> Personal?<br> I've heard of diddling in my time<br> but this beats everything.<br> Will this do?<br> - Thank you, missy.<br> - Come on.<br> Keepsakes.<br> That's all that old age leaves you.<br> How come every man you...<br> How come every man you meet tries to take<br> a snatch at your drawers...<br> before he even tips his hat to you?<br> I can't help it if men see me<br> and like what they see, Boon.<br> Do you have to go give<br> that old quack your garter?<br> I felt sorry for him.<br> Do you always go giving things to people<br> because you feel sorry for them?<br> Lots of times.<br> Next you'll be saying you gave yourself<br> to me because you were sorry for me.<br> I've done that, too!<br> Corrie!<br> Hi!<br> I hope you're all well.<br> How are you, Corrie?<br> I said to the girls:<br> "Let's just get away from it all for a while.<br> "Go put our money on Boon's horse,<br> get rich and retire..."<br> Come on, Lucius. We're going upstairs!<br> Corrie?<br> What is it? What's the...<br> Corrie's not here.<br> She's down at the other end of the hall.<br> Boon! Stop that!<br> - What do you think you're doing?<br> - What does it look like I am doing?<br> - You're getting undressed!<br> - That's right!<br> What's come over you?<br> Same thing that comes over me<br> three times a week, every week.<br> Except when I got hay fever.<br> You put your clothes back on<br> right this minute!<br> Come on, Hannah.<br> Let's be quick. You ain't getting<br> any better looking with time.<br> I wouldn't dream of it!<br> Not in 100 million years.<br> It's gonna be over and done with<br> before you even know it!<br> Absolutely not!<br> Corrie's been like a sister to me.<br> She nursed me through double pneumonia...<br> and she spoon-fed me<br> tapioca for two solid weeks.<br> You're tromping on the urge.<br> I'm getting out of the mood.<br> I'm not going to lose the dearest<br> and sweetest friendship...<br> of my life on account of you!<br> Men like you come and go,<br> but you don't find a Corrie under every tree!<br> Now you get right out of here!<br> Give me back my dollar.<br> Horse, you're the one we want.<br> Now, what's holding you back?<br> You got that long neck for balance...<br> you got them laid-back<br> shoulders for speed...<br> and you got them big hocks...<br> for drive.<br> What you waiting for?<br> What you be looking at<br> when you look far off like that?<br> What?<br> When you gonna do it, horse?<br> So we can all get out of here.<br> Go back home again.<br> We're gonna be rich!<br> Stop yawning and hang on tight.<br> Y'all ready?<br> Don't know what I'm supposed to see<br> that I ain't seen already.<br> Just you watch.<br> Are you ready?<br> I am, but I don't think he is.<br> I ain't even had my breakfast yet.<br> "Man does not live by bread alone."<br> Make sure he sees me.<br> That's the main thing.<br> And cut him at the end.<br> And make him go past.<br> Make him go past!<br> - I can't hold him.<br> - Then let go!<br> Fly!<br> I don't believe it.<br> How'd you do it?<br> I've been telling you all along I would.<br> All we gotta do now is find us<br> $1 million to bet with.<br> Bring her in!<br> What did you make of that?<br> Did he run, or didn't he?<br> - He was terrific.<br> - You bet.<br> I couldn't believe it.<br> - You did it, baby.<br> - We got company.<br> It's that Butch again.<br> Here.<br> Take this. Go on. Hide it.<br> Keep it. Don't lose it.<br> - They ain't gonna bother you.<br> - What's in it?<br> Put it in your pocket. Never you mind.<br> Just do what I say and act natural.<br> All right. Come on over here. All of you.<br> You two are under arrest.<br> What's it for?<br> It's for jail, son.<br> That's what we call it around here.<br> I don't know what you call it<br> where you come from.<br> Yes, sir. We call it jail, too,<br> only we mention why.<br> A lawyer, huh?<br> Well, we got a law now...<br> about bringing good-looking girls<br> across state lines...<br> for lewd and immortal purposes.<br> We just came to see a horse race.<br> And anyway...<br> we've always had very close<br> relations with the police.<br> Sure. You lay them and pay them,<br> but not in this county.<br> Hush up now, Butch,<br> we can settle all this back in town.<br> Right, you folks, you come along now.<br> What about the boy?<br> He's a little young to be in jail, isn't he?<br> He can stay with Uncle Possum. Can't he?<br> No, I don't like that.<br> I don't like no white boy<br> staying with a family of niggers.<br> Mister.<br> There's somewhere that you stop.<br> What'd you say?<br> I said, there's somewhere that the law stops<br> and just people begin.<br> Poleymus, try out our new cuffs<br> on the gentleman.<br> Sure thing, Sheriff.<br> Now, you just simmer down there, boy.<br> Nigger.<br> Don't you ever talk back to me. Hear?<br> Stop that!<br> Mercy.<br> Go for his eyes!<br> He wants the one with the baby-blue eyes.<br> That's you.<br> Come on.<br> As soon as she's tucked in...<br> you'll all be turned loose.<br> Corrie. Don't do it.<br> Corrie!<br> You say your prayers in bed<br> or kneeling down?<br> - Kneeling down.<br> - Say them.<br> Amen.<br> Now, hop in.<br> What's that?<br> It's a whippoorwill,<br> back somewhere beyond the creek.<br> What's that?<br> That's an owl, and a big one, by his voice.<br> You can get closer if you wants to.<br> Lucius, wake up in there.<br> Lucius!<br> Put some fire under you. Come on!<br> I thought you were in jail.<br> I'm out. And we got a race to run.<br> Grab some clothes and come on.<br> - Where's Boon and Corrie?<br> - They're out, too. Hurry up!<br> We gotta get behind that starting wire<br> and win the first heat...<br> get a hold of Boss' automobile and get back<br> to Jefferson...<br> that we hadn't ought to never left.<br> Come on, hurry up. Get your clothes!<br> How'd you get out?<br> Miss Corrie fixed it for us.<br> What do you mean, "fixed it"?<br> What'd she do?<br> Tell him.<br> You know how that Butch has been<br> horsing and studding to get at that gal?<br> I guess she figured when you've been<br> sawing logs as long as she has...<br> what does one more log matter?<br> I don't believe it. She quit.<br> We sure better say much obliged<br> she started again.<br> What'd Boon say?<br> He didn't say nothing. He just smacked her.<br> He hit her? Boon hit her?<br> Don't fret yourself, Lucius.<br> Hitting a woman don't hurt her.<br> All it does is black her eye<br> and cut her mouth a little...<br> and that ain't nothing to a woman.<br> What better sign can a woman want<br> from a man that he's got her on his mind?<br> Luce, where are you going?<br> You gone crazy or something?<br> Come on back, kid!<br> I guess I'm not too gorgeous now, am I?<br> It's a pretty bad shiner.<br> - Does it hurt?<br> - A little bit.<br> Ice is good for a black eye.<br> I could get you some ice.<br> I hope nothing bad<br> ever happens to you again.<br> Hello, Luce. You're a racehorse jockey now.<br> How's your hand?<br> Want any more?<br> No.<br> It's all right, Lucius.<br> I guess I had it coming to me.<br> Let go of me. I'm going home.<br> Just gonna pick up and leave, are you?<br> I'm all done lying. I'm all done stealing.<br> I want to go home.<br> I just...<br> don't want you to lose<br> your good opinion of me.<br> You know, Lucius...<br> I hold you in awful high regard.<br> Boon and Lucius!<br> I hope you all got everything straight.<br> They're getting ready out there.<br> It's off. He's going home.<br> Quitting?<br> How you gonna tell Boss you quit?<br> You could tell him that you lost<br> his automobile for him. That's easy.<br> You could tell him you spent<br> all night in a whorehouse. That's easy.<br> You could tell him that you lied...<br> to your Aunt Callie, your Uncle Ike,<br> and your Cousin Zack. All that's easy.<br> But how are you gonna tell him<br> that you quit?<br> Shut up.<br> I mean, you've been taught better than that.<br> Here's your prize, boys.<br> Run a good race and carry her off.<br> Lose, and see her never no more.<br> All you got to do is beat that there.<br> Bring on Lightning. I'll go home after.<br> Hey, have you got that thing I gave you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Hand it over.<br> First thing is, don't fall off.<br> Don't worry about that other horse,<br> no matter where he is or what he's doing.<br> Just tend to your own. You understand?<br> - Yes.<br> - Okay. Now, listen, Lucius.<br> When you turn into that homestretch<br> towards that wire...<br> have Lightning where he can see me.<br> There can't be nothing in his way.<br> He's got to see me and know that I'm there.<br> - You understand? That's our only chance.<br> - I will.<br> All right, that's all. Except...<br> there ain't no place in the whole world<br> finer than home and our house.<br> So, win, Lucius,<br> so me and you and Boon can go back.<br> All right.<br> Boon.<br> Okay, horse.<br> Now, you just take it easy now.<br> Everything's going to be all right.<br> Good horse.<br> Here, you're counting on me...<br> and I'm so nervous<br> I'm close to wetting my pants.<br> Just keep your mind on the race.<br> You'll be all right.<br> That little boy's gonna ride that big horse?<br> He's not gonna win this race.<br> Hey, sugar.<br> Lucius.<br> Win, Lucius.<br> Come on.<br> Would you please hold down the racket?<br> All right,<br> get these horses off to a clean start.<br> Scared, kid?<br> All right,<br> bring those horses down to the line.<br> Luce!<br> You can be scared if you want to.<br> You can't help that.<br> But don't be afraid, son.<br> Keep together. Come on.<br> Just stay together. That's it.<br> Easy now. Stay together.<br> Son, don't let that black-foot... Come on.<br> Easy now.<br> Kid, you stick on that horse.<br> Hold them right. Steady up there, son.<br> Okay.<br> Come on, Bobo, don't fall back.<br> Hold that sorrel up.<br> All right, now remember,<br> two times around wins.<br> That's it. Keep them together.<br> Good.<br> That's a boy. Good.<br> Stay together. And...<br> go!<br> Ride to me.<br> Faster!<br> Please!<br> Come on, Lucius!<br> Come on!<br> Watch yourself, Luce.<br> Come on, Bobo. Get that rail, boy!<br> Let's go!<br> Faster!<br> Watch out, kid, get out of the way!<br> Get back on the track!<br> Come on, Lucius!<br> What do you mean that sorrel won?<br> How did he do that? He went off the track!<br> Please! Hold down the racket!<br> We won, didn't we? We got across<br> the finish line. They just went around it.<br> Everybody be quiet!<br> Now, everybody, just simmer down.<br> It's pretty clear it wasn't a race.<br> Why not?<br> Take a look at the rule book.<br> It says is if a horse doesn't...<br> commit a foul and doesn't stop running,<br> and the jockey sticks on it...<br> and crosses the finish line first, it wins!<br> Hold on there.<br> According to them rules, my horse won!<br> He didn't foul nobody<br> and he crossed the finish line...<br> showing his butt to your black.<br> No, sir.<br> That finish line just runs across the track<br> from this rail to that rail...<br> and it don't just keep going<br> down into Mississippi.<br> If it did that, there's horses been crossing<br> there since sunup this morning...<br> that we ain't even heard about.<br> He's right.<br> Our horse was first under the wire,<br> and where I come from, mister, first wins.<br> We won!<br> Now you just settle down.<br> Ed, you're the judge.<br> You say how it is, and that's how it is.<br> Please!<br> The question is, what's fair?<br> I propose that we start fresh. All bets stand.<br> Nobody won, nobody lost.<br> Win this next heat and win all.<br> Now get ready for the next race.<br> You can do it. Good luck, Lucius.<br> You up to it, kid?<br> He gave me all he had.<br> I don't think he's got any more.<br> He'll go again.<br> His only aim in life is to get<br> where I am and get what I got.<br> - What have you got?<br> - Something.<br> Is it dope?<br> 'Cause you'll put us right back in jail again.<br> No, it ain't dope.<br> What's in the sack, Ned?<br> Just a sardine.<br> A what?<br> A smelly little old fish<br> about two inches long. That's all it is.<br> Don't lie to me, Ned.<br> Horses don't eat sardines.<br> Well, this one does.<br> He'd eat himself to death on them<br> if you let him.<br> He'd break his legs, bust his lungs,<br> run his heart out for them.<br> I guess that ain't so smart.<br> Then again, if he was smart...<br> he'd be up in the saddle riding, wouldn't he?<br> All right, we're ready.<br> Bring your horse to the line.<br> Now go get 'em.<br> Go!<br> Carried on the back of Lightning...<br> racing on a jet-black shape...<br> it took me completely...<br> blood, skin, bowels, bones...<br> and memory.<br> I was no longer held fast on earth...<br> but free, fluid...<br> part of the air and the sun...<br> running my first race.<br> A man-sized race...<br> with people, grown people...<br> more people than I could remember<br> at one time before, watching me run it.<br> And so I had my moment of glory...<br> that brief, fleeting glory...<br> which of itself cannot last...<br> but while it does...<br> is the best game of all.<br> Let me down. Please let me down.<br> What did you do to your hand?<br> Nothing. It's all right.<br> Well, never mind.<br> We can talk about it later.<br> I can see you're busy now.<br> And so we all went home.<br> Lightning in a boxcar...<br> and the rest of us in the Winton Flyer.<br> We turned up the street toward home...<br> and I thought. ;<br> "Here's something funny.<br> "It hasn't even changed."<br> I couldn't understand<br> why everything was the same...<br> when I wasn't the same anymore.<br> If all the things I had seen and done...<br> had changed nothing...<br> if nothing was smaller, or larger, or older...<br> or wiser...<br> then the last four days had been wasted.<br> Either they'd been wrong<br> and false to begin with...<br> or I was wrong and false...<br> and not worthy of them.<br> I couldn't figure out which.<br> I suppose...<br> this is the main thing<br> you'll always remember about me.<br> Over here.<br> Maury.<br> Come here.<br> This isn't the right way.<br> Let me handle it.<br> If all you can do about it is to whip him...<br> then you're not good enough for him.<br> If he gets the notion that<br> that razor strop cancels out all...<br> the deceit and disobedience...<br> then you're making it<br> too easy for both of you.<br> Same thing you done to me 25 years ago.<br> Maybe I got more sense now.<br> Go upstairs and persuade<br> Alison to stop sniveling.<br> Well, you've had a lively four days.<br> What was it like?<br> What did you do?<br> You want to hear everything?<br> Whatever you care to tell me.<br> We went to Mr. Binford's place.<br> I am acquainted with Mr. Binford's place.<br> They've got some very nice ladies there.<br> You spent the night?<br> - Corrie put me to bed.<br> - Who would Corrie be?<br> She's a friend of Boon's.<br> She got to be my friend, too.<br> And then?<br> The next bed I slept in was Uncle Possum's.<br> He's an old man, like you...<br> only colored.<br> He made me say my prayers.<br> Commendable.<br> I guess I'll have to say<br> a lot of them from now on.<br> Why is that?<br> - I've been telling lies.<br> - Yes, I'm aware of that.<br> Whoppers.<br> I know.<br> Come here.<br> - I can't.<br> - Why not?<br> Because you're a liar?<br> Yes, sir.<br> 'Cause you're afraid<br> I won't ever trust you again?<br> That I don't consider you reliable?<br> That I've lost my respect for you?<br> Is that it?<br> Yes, sir.<br> That's a heavy burden to carry, isn't it?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, you may have to live with that feeling.<br> For the rest of my life?<br> No.<br> But for a while.<br> - I can't, Boss.<br> - Yes, you can. You will.<br> A gentleman can live through anything.<br> A gentleman accepts<br> the responsibilities of his actions...<br> and bears the burden<br> of their consequences...<br> even when he himself<br> did not instigate them...<br> but only acquiesced to them...<br> didn't say no,<br> though he knew he should have.<br> Now, come here.<br> My face was against his stiff collar<br> and his shirt...<br> and I could smell him.<br> The starch, and the shaving lotion...<br> and the chewing tobacco...<br> and finally, that faint smell of whiskey<br> from the toddy...<br> which he took in bed<br> every morning before he got up.<br> There, there, now.<br> That must have emptied the cistern.<br> Now, go wash your face.<br> A gentleman cries, too,<br> but he always washes his face.<br> I'll get you out of the doghouse, Lucius.<br> One of these days,<br> I'm gonna tell them both that it was me...<br> that cooked up the whole thing.<br> - You don't have to do that.<br> - Well, I want to.<br> I want to set things right with them.<br> I want to set things right with you, too.<br> I wonder where they all are now.<br> I wonder what they're doing.<br> I know what one of them is doing.<br> She's out getting herself a white lace dress,<br> size 8, to get married in.<br> Are you talking about Corrie?<br> Are you gonna marry Corrie?<br> Well, if you can go barehanded<br> against a knife...<br> defending her,<br> why the hell can't I marry her?<br> I'm as good as you are, ain't I?<br> Even if I ain't 11 years old.<br> Do you know when you'll feel<br> better about it, Lucius?<br> When you come across town about a year<br> from now, walk in to my house...<br> and see that baby sitting in her arms.<br> You know what we're gonna call him?<br> No.<br> Lucius Priest McCaslin Hogganbeck.<br> Only name he could have.<br>
