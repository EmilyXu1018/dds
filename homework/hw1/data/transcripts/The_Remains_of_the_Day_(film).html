                        Dear Mr. Stevens:<br> You will be surprised to hear<br> from me after all this time.<br> You've been in my thoughts since<br> I heard Lord Darlington had died.<br> We read that his heirs<br> put Darlington Hall up for sale...<br> ... as they no longer wished<br> to maintain it.<br> As no one would buy<br> such a large house...<br> ... the new earl decided to demolish<br> it and sell the stone for 5000 pounds.<br> We also saw some rubbish in the<br> Daily Mail "which made my blood boil:"<br> "Traitor's nest to be pulled down."<br> One hundred and eighty guineas?<br> One hundred and eighty?<br> Have we done?<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> a great highlight of the sale:<br> Lot 414...<br> ...the fine Elizabethan portrait,<br> A Portly Gentleman.<br> I'll start the bidding<br> at 2000 guineas.<br> Four and a half thousand.<br> And a half.<br> And a half.<br> And a half.<br> And a half.<br> And a half.<br> And a half.<br> And a half.<br> Against you, sir,<br> at eleven and a half thousand guineas.<br> All done at<br> eleven and a half thousand guineas.<br> I was very relieved to read<br> how an American millionaire...<br> ... named Lewis saved<br> Darlington Hall...<br> ... so you wouldn't be turned out<br> of your home after all.<br> Is it the same Congressman Lewis...<br> ... who attended His Lordship's<br> conference in 1936?<br> Mr. Stevens, I so often think<br> of the good old days...<br> ... when I was the housekeeper.<br> It was hard work...<br> ... and I have known butlers easier<br> to please than our Mr. Stevens...<br> ... but those years with you were<br> among the happiest of my life.<br> You must have a completely<br> different staff now.<br> Not many of the old faces<br> around anymore.<br> There's not much need<br> for the small army of footmen...<br> ... that Lord Darlington employed.<br> My own news is not very cheerful.<br> In the 7 years since I last wrote,<br> I have again left my husband...<br> ... and, sad to say,<br> my marriage seems to be over.<br> I'm staying at a friend's<br> boarding house in Clevedon.<br> I don't know what my future is.<br> Since Catherine, my daughter, got<br> married, my life has been empty.<br> The years stretch before me and<br> if only I knew how to fill them.<br> But I would like to be useful again.<br> - Burned again?<br> - Yes, I'm sorry, sir.<br> The rule in the kitchen<br> has always been...<br> ...cook cooks the cooked breakfast<br> while her assistant toasts the toast.<br> Why don't we get her a pop-up toaster?<br> We need not a new gadget<br> but a revised staff plan, sir.<br> A staff plan, huh?<br> I didn't know we had one.<br> A faulty one, unfortunately.<br> Sir, quite recently...<br> ...you were kind enough to suggest<br> that I go on a little holiday trip...<br> ...around the country.<br> Absolutely. Certainly, take a break.<br> See the world.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> When did you last see the world?<br> The world always used to come<br> to this house, if I may say so.<br> You may say so.<br> Take off when I'm in London next week.<br> I tell you what, you take the car.<br> - Take the Daimler.<br> - Good Lord, sir, I couldn't.<br> You and that Daimler belong together.<br> You were made for each other.<br> That's most kind of you,<br> I must say, sir. Most kind.<br> I'd meant to travel the West, where I<br> understand we have splendid scenery.<br> And I might incidentally be able<br> to solve our problems while I'm there.<br> A former housekeeper, at present<br> living in Clevedon, has indicated...<br> ...that she might be prepared<br> to return to service.<br> What's this, your girlfriend?<br> Or a former attachment?<br> Oh, no, sir.<br> No, but a very able housekeeper.<br> A most able housekeeper.<br> I was just kidding, Stevens.<br> Sorry.<br> You know what I like best<br> about your papers?<br> These obituaries.<br> Every son of a gun gets<br> this stately funeral oration.<br> - It's not an art we have in the States.<br> - Indeed, sir.<br> Thank you, Stevens.<br> Mr. Lewis.<br> Dear Mrs. Benn...<br> ... I propose to reach Clevedon<br> on October 3rd around 4 p.m.<br> I'd be grateful for a line from you...<br> ... to reach me at the post office<br> at Collingbourne, near Hungerford...<br> ... where I'm planning to stop.<br> Mrs. Benn, I always said you<br> possess an amazing memory.<br> Our new employer is indeed<br> Congressman Lewis...<br> ... though he's now retired<br> from political life in the U.S.<br> He's taken up residence at Darlington<br> Hall, soon to be joined by his family.<br> But I regret to say we are woefully<br> understaffed for a house this size.<br> Mrs. Benn, will you permit me<br> once again to sing your praises?<br> Let me state that when you left<br> to get married...<br> ... no housekeeper ever reached<br> your high standard in any department.<br> I well remember your arrival<br> at Darlington Hall.<br> You came somewhat unexpectedly,<br> one might even say impulsively...<br> ... while we were dead in the middle<br> of the Charlgrove meet.<br> That day is marked in my<br> memory in another way as well.<br> It was the last time His Lordship...<br> ... was happy to welcome<br> his neighbours, as in the old days.<br> Of course, it had been years since<br> any of them had coaxed him to hunt.<br> It was never a sport His Lordship<br> enjoyed or approved of.<br> - Good morning, Ayres.<br> - My lord, nice to see you.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> I fear I may have been a little<br> unwelcoming, even a little short.<br> You presented the best references<br> I've ever seen.<br> Which proved to be well-deserved.<br> Though, I confess, I did have my<br> doubts, on account of your youth.<br> No gentleman callers allowed,<br> of course.<br> Forgive my mentioning it, but we've<br> had those problems before.<br> Inside the house too.<br> The previous housekeeper ran off<br> with the under-butler.<br> If two staff members decide to get<br> married, one can say nothing.<br> What I find a major irritation...<br> ...are those persons who go from<br> post to post looking for romance.<br> Housekeepers are particularly<br> guilty here.<br> - No offense intended, of course.<br> - None taken.<br> I know how a house is at sixes and<br> sevens once the staff start marrying.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> - Might I have a word, sir?<br> - Of course.<br> My lord, it's regarding<br> the under-butler...<br> ...and the housekeeper<br> who ran off last month.<br> Bad business.<br> How are you managing?<br> I've found two<br> first-rate replacements.<br> Miss Kenton, a young woman<br> with excellent references.<br> Very pleasing demeanour.<br> Appears to be very able.<br> And a man with<br> considerable experience.<br> - Older and happy to be under-butler.<br> - Name?<br> Stevens, sir.<br> - Stevens?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - That's your name.<br> - He's my father, sir.<br> Really?<br> Couldn't do better.<br> I'd like to see him sometime.<br> He's outside the door.<br> Good. Bring him in.<br> Thank you, my lord.<br> Father.<br> Mr. Stevens, how do you do?<br> - My lord.<br> - Very good man here, your son.<br> He serves the house well.<br> I don't know what we'd do without him.<br> - Proud of him?<br> - Very, my lord.<br> Quite right too.<br> Glad to have you with us.<br> Thank you, my lord.<br> What are we at dinner tonight?<br> Twelve, sir.<br> Right.<br> Thank you, my lord.<br> - This pitcher seems out of place here.<br> - Dining room. Well spotted.<br> - Hello, William, how are you?<br> - Good day, Miss Kenton.<br> I thought these might<br> brighten your parlour.<br> Beg your pardon?<br> They might cheer things up for you.<br> That's very kind of you.<br> If you like, I could bring in<br> some more for you.<br> Thank you...<br> ...but I regard this room<br> as my private place of work...<br> ...and I prefer to keep distractions<br> to a minimum.<br> Would you call flowers<br> a distraction, then?<br> I appreciate your kindness.<br> I prefer to keep things as they are.<br> But since you are here, there is a<br> small matter I wanted to mention.<br> I happened to be walking past<br> the kitchen yesterday morning...<br> ...and I heard you call<br> to someone named William.<br> May I ask who you were<br> addressing by that name?<br> I should think I was<br> addressing your father.<br> There are no other Williams<br> in this house.<br> True.<br> May I ask you in future to address<br> my father as Mr. Stevens?<br> If speaking of him<br> to a third party, you may call him...<br> ...Mr. Stevens Sr.<br> to distinguish him from myself.<br> So I would be most grateful to you,<br> Miss Kenton.<br> I don't quite understand<br> what you're getting at.<br> I am the housekeeper in this house,<br> and your father is the under-butler.<br> I am accustomed to addressing under-<br> servants by their Christian names.<br> If you would stop to think for a moment,<br> you'd realize...<br> ...how inappropriate it is for one such<br> as yourself to address as William...<br> ...someone such as my father.<br> It must have been very galling for<br> your father to be called William...<br> ...by one such as myself.<br> My father is a person from whom...<br> ...if you'd observe him more,<br> you may learn things.<br> I'm grateful for your advice,<br> but do tell me...<br> ...what things might I learn from him?<br> I might point out that you're...<br> ...often unsure of what goes where<br> and which item is which.<br> I'm sure Mr. Stevens Sr.<br> is very good at his job...<br> ...but I can assure you<br> that I'm very good at mine.<br> - Of course.<br> - Thank you.<br> If you will please excuse me.<br> Oh, well.<br> My compliments to cook.<br> What a lovely piece of crackling.<br> I'm sure you said something witty.<br> Share it with the rest of us.<br> I said the sprouts is done the way<br> I like them. Crisp-like, not mushy.<br> Sprouts "are" done, not "is" done.<br> Isn't that right, George?<br> Yes, Mr. Stevens.<br> Forgive the correction,<br> as I would have done...<br> ...at your age for the sake<br> of my education.<br> I'm sure even you have ambitions<br> to rise in your profession.<br> Oh, yes. I want to be<br> a butler, to be called Mister...<br> ...sit in my own pantry by my own fire,<br> smoking my cigar.<br> I wonder if you realize what it takes<br> to be a great butler?<br> Takes dignity, that's what it takes.<br> Thank you, Mr. Stevens.<br> Dignity, that's right. Dignity.<br> The definition from our quarterly<br> "The Gentlemen's Gentleman":<br> A great butler must be possessed<br> of dignity...<br> In keeping with his position.<br> There was this English butler<br> in India.<br> One day, he goes in the dining room<br> and what's under the table?<br> A tiger.<br> Not turning a hair,<br> he goes to the drawing room.<br> "Excuse me, my lord," and whispering,<br> so as not to upset the ladies:<br> "I'm sorry. There appears to<br> be a tiger in the dining room.<br> Perhaps His Lordship will permit<br> use of the twelve-bores?"<br> They go on drinking their tea.<br> And then, there's three gunshots.<br> They don't think nothing of it.<br> In India, they're used to anything.<br> When the butler is back<br> to refresh the teapots...<br> ...he says, cool as a cucumber:<br> "Dinner will be served<br> at the usual time, my lord.<br> And I am pleased to say there will<br> be no discernible traces left...<br> ...of the recent occurrence<br> by that time."<br> I'll repeat it. "There will be<br> no discernible traces left...<br> ...of the recent occurrence<br> by that time."<br> - Wonderful, Mr. Stevens.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Stevens.<br> Wonderful story. That's the ideal<br> that we should all aim for. Dignity.<br> For you, Mr. Stevens.<br> Thank you.<br> It's for Mr. Stevens Sr.,<br> Mr. Stevens.<br> Thank you, Miss Kenton.<br> Put Mr. Stevens Sr. 's plate<br> with cook to keep it warm.<br> Yes, Miss Kenton.<br> Thank you.<br> Not at all, Mr. Stevens.<br> If you're searching for your dustpan,<br> it is out on the landing.<br> My dustpan?<br> You've left it on the landing.<br> - I haven't used a dustpan.<br> - Really? It must be somebody else.<br> - I don't follow you.<br> - My mistake, no doubt. One of many.<br> Morning, sir.<br> I've invited Giscard Dupont D'Ivry<br> as the French delegate.<br> He'll never come!<br> I just had word of his acceptance.<br> Dupont is fanatically anti-German.<br> His speech in Geneva in '33...<br> ...made me ashamed to be<br> an ally of the French.<br> It's not the English way.<br> No, it is not.<br> This is the purpose of our conference,<br> to discuss these matters informally...<br> ...far from the to-do<br> of an international conference...<br> ...in the friendly and relaxed...<br> ...atmosphere of one's home.<br> We may bring round the French<br> to our point of view.<br> And that of the Germans.<br> I'm sorry to interrupt, but how can we<br> associate with the Germans?<br> With the Nazi Party! They have torn<br> up and trampled every treaty...<br> ...and are a growing threat to Europe,<br> not to mention a brutal dictatorship.<br> My dear boy, when I was in Berlin,<br> I saw at last a happy German people...<br> ...with jobs, bread, pride in their<br> country and love of their leader.<br> And what about the Jews?<br> Did His Lordship wish to exchange<br> the Chinaman in the cabinet room...<br> ...with the one outside the door?<br> - Chinaman?<br> - Yes.<br> The Chinaman from the cabinet room is<br> outside this door. See for yourself.<br> I'm busy at the moment.<br> Just pop your head outside this door<br> and see for yourself.<br> - I'll look into the matter later.<br> - You think it's a fantasy?<br> A fantasy on my part<br> due to my inexperience?<br> I'm busy in this room, Miss Kenton.<br> I shall wait.<br> Outside.<br> Look!<br> - Is that not the wrong Chinaman?<br> - I am very busy.<br> Have you nothing better to do<br> than stand around?<br> Look at it and tell me the truth.<br> Keep your voice down.<br> What would the other servants think...<br> ...of us shouting about a Chinaman?<br> And I would ask you...<br> ...to turn around<br> and look at the Chinaman.<br> It is a small mistake.<br> Your father is entrusted with more<br> than he can cope with.<br> Let me pass.<br> Your father left the dustpan<br> on the floor.<br> He left polish on the cutlery<br> and confused the Chinaman.<br> Recognize this before he commits<br> a major error!<br> - You can't talk to me like this.<br> - I'm afraid I must.<br> I'm giving you serious advice.<br> Your father should be relieved of a<br> number of his duties for his own good.<br> Whatever he once was, he no longer<br> has the same ability or strength.<br> I thank you for your advice.<br> Perhaps now I can go about<br> my business.<br> I never meant to keep you<br> from your business.<br> Thank you.<br> It's vital that we've agreed a common<br> policy before the arrival of...<br> ...your Frenchman. What's his name?<br> - Giscard Dupont D'Ivry.<br> We also expect the<br> American delegate...<br> ...Congressman Lewis,<br> to arrive on the same day.<br> Who is he, this American?<br> He's an unknown quantity. A young<br> congressman from Pennsylvania.<br> Sits on some sort of powerful<br> Foreign Affairs Committee.<br> Heir to one of those<br> American fortunes.<br> - Meatpacking?<br> - Trolley cars?<br> Or dry goods?<br> What are dry goods?<br> Something that Americans make<br> a lot of money in.<br> No, I think Mr. Lewis' fortune<br> comes from cosmetics, actually.<br> It's old Mr. Stevens!<br> Get a cushion, quickly.<br> A blanket!<br> The silver!<br> The silver!<br> Oh, my lord. Sorry.<br> You'll be all right.<br> Thank you, sir. I'm sorry.<br> What happened?<br> - He tripped with the tray.<br> - I saw it from the window.<br> This has never happened before.<br> - May I telephone the doctor?<br> - Yes, do.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Don't worry.<br> Your father feeling better?<br> He's made a full recovery.<br> Good.<br> We don't wish to see anything<br> of that sort ever happen again, do we?<br> - I mean, your father collapsing.<br> - Indeed not, my lord.<br> And it could happen anywhere.<br> At any time.<br> The first of the foreign delegates<br> will be here in less than a fortnight.<br> - We are well prepared, my lord.<br> - I'm sure you are.<br> What happens within this house<br> could have...<br> ...considerable repercussions<br> on the course that Europe takes.<br> It means a great deal.<br> And it means a great deal<br> to me personally.<br> I had a German friend,<br> Karl-Heinz Bremann.<br> We fought on opposite sides<br> in the war.<br> We always said when it was over,<br> we'd sit down and have a drink...<br> ...like gentlemen.<br> The Versailles Treaty<br> made a liar of me.<br> Yes, a liar, Stevens.<br> Because the terms we imposed were<br> so harsh that Germany was finished.<br> One doesn't do that<br> to a defeated foe.<br> Once your man's on the canvas,<br> it ought to be over.<br> My friend Bremann<br> was ruined by inflation.<br> Couldn't get a job<br> in postwar Germany.<br> Killed himself.<br> Shot himself in a railway carriage.<br> Since then, I've felt it my duty<br> to help Germany and to give her...<br> ...a fair chance.<br> So this conference is crucial...<br> ...and we can't run the risk<br> of any accidents.<br> There's no question<br> of your father leaving.<br> You're simply being asked<br> to reconsider his duties.<br> Of course, my lord.<br> I understand fully.<br> Good.<br> I'll leave you to think about it,<br> then, Stevens.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I'm short-handed in the dining room.<br> I can use you in the servery.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Stevens, sir.<br> - Smarten up. Look sharp.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> I might've known you'd be up<br> and ready for the day.<br> I've been up for two hours.<br> - That's not much sleep.<br> - It's all the sleep I need.<br> I've come to talk to you.<br> Talk, then.<br> I haven't got all morning.<br> - I'll come straight to the point.<br> - Do, and be done with it.<br> Some of us have work<br> to be getting on with.<br> There's to be a very important<br> conference in this house next week.<br> People of great stature will be<br> His Lordship's guests.<br> We must all put our best foot forward.<br> Because of Father's recent accident...<br> ...it has been suggested that you<br> no longer wait at table.<br> I've waited at table every day...<br> ...for the last 54 years.<br> It has also been decided that you<br> should no longer carry heavy trays.<br> Now, here's a revised list<br> of your duties.<br> Look, I fell...<br> ...because of those paving stones.<br> They're crooked.<br> Why don't you get them put right<br> before someone else falls?<br> You will read the revised list<br> of your duties.<br> Get those stones put right.<br> You don't want those "gentlemen of stature"<br> breaking their necks.<br> No, indeed, I don't.<br> What is it?<br> You have what we can call<br> a roving commission.<br> In other words, you can exercise<br> your own judgment...<br> ...within certain limits, of course.<br> Now, here are the mops, and...<br> Here.<br> - Are these me mops?<br> - Right. Your brushes.<br> And me brushes?<br> - And me mops.<br> - That's right.<br> What do you want me to do with them?<br> I think you know what to do with them,<br> Father. Look for dust and dirt.<br> If I find any dust or dirt...<br> ...I go over them with this mop.<br> That's right.<br> Now, I suggest you start off...<br> ...with the brasses on the doors.<br> There's that door there.<br> Then the door that's open.<br> And then there's this door here...<br> Here's your polish.<br> And duster.<br> History could well be made under<br> this roof over the next few days.<br> Each and every one of you...<br> ...can be proud of the role<br> you will play on this occasion.<br> Imagine yourself<br> the head of a battalion...<br> ... even if it is only filling<br> the hot-water bottles.<br> Each one has his own<br> particular duty...<br> ... or her particular duty,<br> as the cap fits.<br> Polished brass, brilliant silver,<br> mahogany shining like a mirror.<br> That is the welcome we will show<br> these foreign visitors...<br> ... to let them know<br> they are in England...<br> ... where order and tradition<br> still prevail.<br> Thank you, Brian.<br> Mr. Lewis, the American,<br> has arrived.<br> He was expected tomorrow.<br> What have you done with him?<br> Mr. Lewis has been shown upstairs.<br> My godson, Cardinal, will shortly<br> become engaged to be married.<br> Indeed, sir.<br> I offer my congratulations.<br> Thank you, Stevens.<br> I feel very responsible for the boy.<br> He is my godson, and his father<br> was my closest friend, as you know.<br> And now that he's gone, well...<br> ...I feel in place of a father to him.<br> I've appointed him as my secretary<br> at the conference.<br> He's been jolly thorough<br> in helping me to prepare.<br> I realize this is a somewhat<br> irregular thing to ask you to do.<br> I'd be glad to be of any assistance.<br> I'm sorry to bring this up...<br> ...but I just can't see how on earth<br> to make it go away.<br> You are familiar with<br> the facts of life?<br> - My lord?<br> - The facts of life.<br> Birds, bees.<br> You are familiar, aren't you?<br> I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.<br> Let me put my cards on the table.<br> I'm so busy with this conference.<br> Of course, you are too...<br> ...but someone has to tell him.<br> In a way, it would be easier for you.<br> Less awkward.<br> I'd find the task rather daunting,<br> I'm afraid.<br> I might not get to it<br> before Reginald's wedding day.<br> Of course, this goes far beyond<br> the call of duty.<br> I shall do my best.<br> I'd be grateful if you'd try.<br> It'd be a lot off my mind.<br> There's no need to make a song and<br> dance of it. Just convey the facts.<br> God! Stevens!<br> Sorry. Most sorry, sir...<br> ...but I do have something to convey<br> to you rather urgently.<br> If I may, I'll come to the point.<br> Perhaps you noticed this morning the<br> ducks and the geese by the pond?<br> Ducks and geese?<br> I don't think so.<br> Well, perhaps the birds<br> and the flowers, then...<br> ...or the shrubs, the bees...<br> I've not seen any bees.<br> - It's not the best time to see them.<br> - What, the bees?<br> What I'm saying is that,<br> with the arrival of spring...<br> ...we shall see a most remarkable<br> and profound change...<br> ...in the surroundings.<br> I'm sure that's right. I'm sure the<br> grounds are not at their best now.<br> I wasn't paying attention<br> to the glories of nature...<br> ...because it's worrying...<br> Dupont D'Ivry has arrived in a foul<br> mood, the last thing anyone wants.<br> - M. Dupont D'Ivry has arrived?<br> - Half an hour ago, in a foul mood.<br> In that case, excuse me.<br> I'd better go and attend to him.<br> Right you are.<br> Kind of you to talk to me.<br> Not at all. I've one or two words<br> more to convey on the topic of...<br> ...as you put it most admirably...<br> ...the glories of nature.<br> But it must wait for another occasion.<br> I'll look forward to it.<br> But I'm more of a fish man.<br> - Fish?<br> - I know all about fish.<br> Freshwater and salt.<br> All living creatures would be<br> relevant to our discussion.<br> Excuse me. I had no idea that<br> "Monsieur" Dupont D'Ivry had arrived.<br> Thank you.<br> May I be of assistance, sir?<br> Oh, the butler.<br> I have sore feet, so I need a basin<br> with warm water and salts, please.<br> I'll arrange that with<br> the housekeeper, sir.<br> Warm water and salts<br> as soon as possible.<br> How do you do? But I speak English.<br> Good. That's lucky for me.<br> I'm Jack Lewis, the U.S. delegate.<br> Could we speak privately soon?<br> Yes, of course.<br> But I have blisters due to some<br> sightseeing they made me do in London.<br> I had already seen<br> the Tower of London.<br> I've discovered that things<br> are not moving...<br> ...in a direction that I think<br> you would approve of.<br> German rearmament<br> is a fact to be accepted.<br> It's in our own interest to have a free<br> and equal Germany.<br> Not a prostrate nation...<br> ...upon whom an unfair peace treaty<br> was imposed 16 years ago.<br> Those who've been in Germany...<br> ...can only thrill, as I have,<br> to the signs of rebirth.<br> ...to assist Germany in her virile<br> struggle for economic recovery...<br> ...including support for her fair<br> demand for equality of armaments...<br> ...and universal military service<br> for German youth.<br> If we, in postwar Europe...<br> I need more water.<br> I need another basin to bathe my feet.<br> Follow me, sir.<br> Excuse me.<br> - We have to talk.<br> - This way, sir.<br> My friend, I am in agony.<br> Too tight shoes. I blame myself.<br> Vanity.<br> We must do some fast maneuvering<br> to restrain the Germans.<br> Please come this way, gentlemen.<br> Butler, please, could you help me<br> with my feet... shoe?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - Take it off.<br> What they said about equality of arms<br> for Germany, military service...<br> - Sorry, sir.<br> - I'll manage.<br> What?<br> Your father's been taken ill, sir.<br> - Where?<br> - Outside the Chinese bedroom, sir.<br> Germany wants peace as much as we do.<br> She needs peace.<br> Here, let me help you with that.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, Charles.<br> Take a basin of hot water and salts...<br> ...to Mr. D'Ivry in the<br> billiards room. Is that understood?<br> - Yes, Mr. Stevens.<br> - Good. Do it.<br> Father?<br> I have more time than you to look<br> after him. I've called the doctor.<br> Thank you, Miss Kenton.<br> Your father's not so good, I'm afraid.<br> If he deteriorates, call me, will you?<br> How old is he? 70, 72?<br> - 75, sir.<br> - I see.<br> - Lf he deteriorates, let me know.<br> - I will, sir. Thank you, doctor.<br> More haste, less speed.<br> There's something missing.<br> What is it?<br> - The spoon from the cruet set, sir.<br> - Good.<br> Well observed.<br> Now, never touch the lip of the glass.<br> Good.<br> Glass first, and then...<br> Is everything in hand downstairs?<br> We're preparing the last dinner<br> of the conference.<br> You can imagine the kitchen.<br> - But is everything in hand?<br> - Yes, I think we're up to scratch.<br> Are you feeling any better?<br> There's something I have to tell you.<br> I have so much to do.<br> Why don't we talk in the morning?<br> Jim...<br> ...I fell out of love<br> with your mother.<br> I loved her once.<br> The love went out of me<br> when I found her carrying on.<br> A good son.<br> Proud of you.<br> I hope I've been a good father.<br> I tried me best.<br> You better get down there...<br> ...or heaven only knows<br> what they'll be up to.<br> Go on.<br> Go on!<br> We'll talk in the morning.<br> On the last day of our conference...<br> ...permit me to say<br> how impressed I have been...<br> ...with the spirit of goodwill<br> that has prevailed.<br> Goodwill for Germany.<br> And with tears in my eyes...<br> ...I see that everyone here<br> has recognized...<br> ...our right to be, once again,<br> a strong nation.<br> With my hand on my heart,<br> I declare...<br> ...that Germany needs peace...<br> ...and desires only peace.<br> Peace with England...<br> ...and peace with France.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I, too, have been impressed...<br> ...yes, deeply impressed...<br> ...by the genuine desire for peace<br> manifested at this conference.<br> Unlike our American colleague...<br> ...we in Europe know<br> the horrors of war.<br> And whether we are French<br> or English or Italian or German...<br> ...our one desire is to never<br> have to experience them again.<br> Indeed.<br> Impressed, or I may say touched...<br> ...by the words of goodwill<br> and friendship I have heard...<br> ...I promise you that I shall do<br> my utmost...<br> ...to change my country's policy...<br> ...towards that nation<br> which was once our foe...<br> ...but is now,<br> I may venture to say...<br> ...our friend.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...the United States doesn't want war<br> any more than you do.<br> On the other hand, neither do we<br> want peace at any price...<br> ...because some prices,<br> you may find...<br> ...are too outrageously high to pay.<br> But let's not get into that now.<br> We may have to soon enough.<br> For the moment, let us raise<br> our glasses to Lord Darlington...<br> ...in gratitude for his<br> magnificent hospitality.<br> Lord Darlington is a classic<br> English gentleman of the old school.<br> Decent and honorable and well-meaning.<br> So are all of you. All decent,<br> honorable and well-meaning gentlemen.<br> It's a pleasure and a privilege<br> to visit with you here.<br> But...<br> ...now, excuse me, I must say this...<br> ...you are, all of you, amateurs.<br> And international affairs should<br> never be run by gentlemen amateurs.<br> Do you have any idea of what sort<br> of a place the world is becoming?<br> The days when you could act<br> out of noble instincts are over.<br> Europe has become the arena of<br> "Realpolitik", the politics of reality.<br> If you like, real politics.<br> What you need is not gentlemen<br> politicians, but real ones.<br> You need professionals,<br> or you're headed for disaster.<br> So I propose a toast, gentlemen...<br> ...to the professionals.<br> Well, I've no wish to enter<br> into a quarrel...<br> ...on our last evening together.<br> But let me say this.<br> What you describe as amateurism...<br> ...is what I think most of us here<br> still prefer to call honour.<br> Miss Kenton would like to see you<br> concerning your father.<br> I suggest that your professionalism<br> means greed and power...<br> ...rather than to see justice<br> and goodness prevail in the world.<br> I've never concealed from myself<br> that what we were asking of Germany...<br> ...is a complete break from the<br> tradition of this country. Thank you.<br> Mr. Stevens, I'm very sorry.<br> Your father passed away<br> four minutes ago.<br> Oh, I see.<br> I'm so very sorry.<br> I wish there was something<br> I could say.<br> Will you come up and see him?<br> Well, I'm very busy at the moment.<br> In a little while, perhaps.<br> In that case, will you permit me<br> to close his eyes?<br> I would be most grateful.<br> Thank you.<br> My father would wish me to carry on.<br> I can't let him down.<br> No. Of course.<br> I'd really like to continue<br> our little chat sometime.<br> About nature.<br> You're right. I should come back<br> when everything's burgeoning.<br> Yes, sir. Indeed.<br> As I said before, my main interest<br> has always been in fish.<br> When I was small,<br> I kept tropical fish in a tank.<br> I harboured quite a passion for them.<br> I'll have another drop of that,<br> if you don't mind.<br> You all right?<br> I'm perfectly all right.<br> Not feeling unwell?<br> No, sir. A little tired, perhaps.<br> Wonderful!<br> What a beautiful example of German<br> culture you've brought to this house.<br> Very nice.<br> I hope there's no hard feelings.<br> Oh, my dear good chap.<br> I like a good, clean fight.<br> Giving as good as one gets, what?<br> I have the greatest respect<br> for the English. I love it here.<br> My family brought us here as kids,<br> so I feel at home.<br> Anyway, thank you.<br> Excuse me.<br> You all right?<br> Yes, perfect, my lord.<br> You coming down<br> with a cold or something?<br> It's been a long day.<br> It's been a hard day for both of us.<br> Well done.<br> My condolences.<br> It was a stroke. A severe stroke.<br> He wouldn't have suffered much pain.<br> Thank you for telling me.<br> There's a distinguished foreign<br> gentleman in the billiard room...<br> ...in need of attention.<br> Urgent?<br> His feet.<br> Feet?<br> - I'll take you to him.<br> - Lf it's urgent.<br> It is urgent.<br> The gentleman is in pain.<br> My condolences.<br> Thank you. That is most kind of you.<br> Good afternoon.<br> My name is Stevens.<br> I'm hoping there's a letter for me.<br> - I'll just check for you, sir.<br> - James Stevens.<br> - I'd like two apples, please.<br> - There you are, Mr. Stevens.<br> - You are touring in these parts?<br> - I'm on my way to Clevedon.<br> - How much is that?<br> - That'll be threepence, please.<br> And you'd be coming from...?<br> - Oxfordshire.<br> - Whereabouts?<br> - Sorry?<br> - Whereabouts in Oxfordshire?<br> Darlington.<br> That rings a bell. Wasn't there<br> a Lord Darlington? Some sort...<br> ...of Nazi, got us in the war?<br> I'm the butler there,<br> and my employer...<br> ...is Mr. Lewis, an American gentleman.<br> I didn't know the former owner.<br> Your change.<br> I should be glad to meet you at the<br> Sea View Hotel, opposite the pier.<br> We'll have such a lot to talk about,<br> and I'll have many questions.<br> Ex cept for you, I've lost touch with<br> all our friends at Darlington Hall.<br> But that's no wonder.<br> It was long ago and a lot<br> has happened in between.<br> Who could keep track of all the people<br> His Lordship once employed?<br> My lord, you rang?<br> - Have the young German ladies arrived?<br> - They're outside.<br> I'd like to say hello to them,<br> practise my German.<br> - They do speak excellent English.<br> - Good. Well, ask them to come in.<br> This is Elsa and this is Irma.<br> I'm asking about their journey.<br> It was long, my lord.<br> I asked if they like the weather.<br> We are grateful to you, my lord,<br> for letting us come here.<br> Our parents are very grateful.<br> Not at all.<br> Miss Kenton will look after you.<br> - Won't you?<br> - Indeed, my lord.<br> Welcome to Darlington Hall.<br> - Thank you, my lord.<br> - Thank you, my lord.<br> Will there be anything else?<br> Sir Geoffrey.<br> Good to see you.<br> How do you do?<br> Well, come in.<br> - Mr. Benn.<br> - Mr. Stevens.<br> Gentlemen, if you'd like to wait<br> here for a while.<br> - Aren't you still at Stanton Lacey?<br> - I'm with Sir Geoffrey now.<br> - You haven't changed one bit.<br> - I'll let you get on.<br> - Perhaps we'll meet later.<br> - I hope so.<br> But, gentlemen, you speak of Jews<br> and Gypsies, Negroes and so forth.<br> But one has to regard the racial<br> laws of the Fascists...<br> ...as a sanitary measure,<br> much overdue, in my opinion.<br> Imagine trying to enforce<br> such a rule in this country...<br> You cannot run a country<br> without a penal system.<br> Here we call them prisons. There,<br> they call them concentration camps.<br> Is there any meat<br> of any kind in this soup?<br> I think it's mushroom stock, sir.<br> Mushroom ends and skins,<br> onion and celery. No meat at all.<br> Cold water, and then cook adds sherry.<br> I hear you have a Labour fellow<br> from your constituency.<br> Over there, they've got rid of<br> all that trade union rubbish.<br> Believe me, no workers strike<br> in Germany.<br> And everyone's kept in line.<br> No wonder this country<br> is going down the drain.<br> It is internally diseased.<br> I think there may be butter<br> in the croutons. Do you know?<br> I'm afraid there may be.<br> You've made a cozy little nest here.<br> Seems to me you must be<br> a well-contented man.<br> In my philosophy, Mr. Benn...<br> ...a man cannot call himself<br> well-contented...<br> ...until he has done all he can...<br> ...to be of service to his employer.<br> This assumes that one's employer...<br> ...is a superior person<br> not only in rank or wealth...<br> ...but in moral stature.<br> And in your opinion, what's going on<br> up there has "moral stature"?<br> I wish I could be sure.<br> But I'm not.<br> I've heard some very fishy things.<br> Very fishy.<br> I hear nothing.<br> Listen.<br> That's so touching, isn't it?<br> To listen to the gentlemen<br> would distract me from my work.<br> It's fresh soda.<br> Would you be joining us?<br> Thank you, but it's very late<br> and I have an early start.<br> Good night.<br> - Good night, Mr. Stevens.<br> - Good night, Miss Kenton.<br> Good-looking woman.<br> It was never the same<br> after she left Stanton Lacey.<br> I handed in my own notice<br> six months later.<br> I'd be lost without her.<br> A first-rate housekeeper<br> is essential in a house like this...<br> ...where great affairs are decided<br> between these walls.<br> - Good morning.<br> - My lord.<br> "We do the Jews no injustice when we<br> say that the revelation of Christ...<br> ... is something incomprehensible<br> and hateful to them.<br> Though He apparently sprang<br> from their midst...<br> ... He embodies the negation of their<br> whole nature.<br> The Jews are far more sensitive<br> about this than we are.<br> This demonstration of the cleft that<br> separates us Europeans from the Jew...<br> ... is not given in order<br> to let religious prejudice...<br> ... with its dangerous bias,<br> settle the matter...<br> ... but because the perception of<br> two fundamentally different natures...<br> ... reveals a real gulf."<br> We have some refugee girls<br> on the staff now, I believe.<br> We do.<br> Two housemaids, Elsa and Irma.<br> You'll have to let them go,<br> I'm afraid.<br> Let them go, my lord?<br> It's regrettable,<br> but we have no choice.<br> You must see the whole thing<br> in context.<br> I have the well-being<br> of my guests to consider.<br> May I say...<br> ...they work extremely well.<br> They're intelligent, polite<br> and very clean.<br> I'm sorry, but I've looked<br> into this matter very carefully.<br> There are larger issues at stake.<br> I'm sorry, but there it is.<br> They're Jews.<br> Yes, my lord.<br> I'm amazed you can stand<br> there as if...<br> ...discussing old...<br> ...you were discussing orders<br> for the larder. I can't believe it!<br> Elsa and Irma are to be dismissed<br> because they're Jewish?<br> His Lordship has decided. There's<br> nothing for you and I to discuss.<br> Without work, they could be<br> sent back to Germany.<br> It is out of our hands.<br> I tell you, if you dismiss my girls<br> tomorrow, it will be wrong!<br> A sin, as any sin ever was one!<br> There are many things you and I<br> don't understand in this world.<br> His Lordship understands fully and has<br> studied the larger issues at stake...<br> ...concerning, say...<br> ...the nature of Jewry.<br> I warn you...<br> ...if those girls go...<br> ...I shall leave this house.<br> Please.<br> These references,<br> I have to tell you...<br> ...are quite reserved.<br> Why did you leave<br> your last employment?<br> - They didn't want me anymore.<br> - Why not?<br> I don't know.<br> They just didn't want me anymore.<br> They say she works well.<br> Would you please wait outside?<br> - She's unsuitable.<br> - Not at all. I want her.<br> - She'll be under my supervision.<br> - She's not suitable.<br> She'll do well. I'll see to it.<br> Well, then, it is entirely<br> your responsibility.<br> Weren't you leaving<br> because of the German girls?<br> I'm not leaving.<br> I've nowhere to go. I have no family.<br> I'm a coward.<br> Yes. I am a coward.<br> I'm frightened of leaving,<br> and that's the truth.<br> All I see out in the world<br> is loneliness, and it frightens me.<br> That's all my high principles<br> are worth.<br> I'm ashamed of myself.<br> You mean a great deal to this house.<br> You're extremely important<br> to this house.<br> Am I?<br> Now, look here...<br> ...if you're really sure about<br> this young woman, call her back in.<br> Miss Hull, we would like you<br> to start next week.<br> You're responsible to Miss Kenton.<br> She'll explain the house rules.<br> Number one: no gentlemen callers,<br> or other such.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Good.<br> - Welcome.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Well done.<br> I'll show you to your room.<br> I'd forgotten how much petrol<br> the Daimler uses.<br> It's an impractical motor to be<br> going about the country, Mister...<br> Smith. Harry Smith. It's a privilege<br> to have you here in Moscombe.<br> - It's a privilege to be here.<br> - Your health, sir.<br> Dr. Carlisle usually drops in<br> around now. He'd enjoy meeting you.<br> He's a gentleman like yourself.<br> I don't know what you call<br> a gentleman.<br> It's a name every man<br> in this country has a right to.<br> There's Harry Smith now, giving<br> you an earful of his philosophy.<br> We English...<br> ...have the advantage and privilege<br> of expressing our opinions...<br> ...and voting for Parliament.<br> That's what we fought Hitler for.<br> Have you had much to do<br> with politics yourself?<br> Not directly as such, no,<br> particularly in these days.<br> Perhaps more so in the early 1930s<br> and just before the war.<br> My concern was more<br> international affairs.<br> Or foreign policy, so to speak.<br> Not that I ever held high office,<br> mind you.<br> No, any influence I exerted<br> was in an unofficial capacity.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Have you ever met Mr. Churchill?<br> He came to the house occasionally.<br> Again, in the early 1930s.<br> He was a bloody warmonger!<br> Honestly, Harry! We wouldn't have won<br> the war without him.<br> Not content to fight Germans,<br> he sent troops in against the miners.<br> - What about the war?<br> - Yes, all right.<br> He did well in the war,<br> but he should've stepped down.<br> - And Mr. Eden?<br> - He made a right bugger of Suez!<br> Yes, I met Mr. Eden.<br> Yes, occasionally.<br> How do you do? Richard Carlisle.<br> Rotten luck about your car,<br> but nice to have you.<br> - Everyone has been most kind.<br> - He says he knows foreign affairs.<br> Is that so, indeed?<br> In an unofficial capacity.<br> - He knows Mr. Churchill.<br> - And Mr. Eden.<br> Really?<br> Yes, well, it was my good fortune<br> to have consorted...<br> ...with many men of influence<br> from Europe and from America.<br> Mr. Taylor...<br> ...I really feel I ought to retire now<br> because I'm feeling rather tired.<br> No wonder, sir.<br> Running out of petrol...<br> ...then having to hear Smith's<br> political opinions.<br> Just step this way, sir.<br> I'm going to Stanbury in the<br> morning. I'll give you a lift...<br> ...and we could pick up<br> a can of petrol on the way.<br> - I'd hate to inconvenience you.<br> - Not at all. Would 7:30 suit you?<br> You'll enjoy talking to Dr. Carlisle.<br> Watch this step.<br> Excuse Harry Smith.<br> He will go on about his politics.<br> I don't mean he's not right.<br> Democracy is why we fought Hitler, and<br> we lost a few lads in this village...<br> ...including our son here.<br> Dunkirk.<br> I'll get you a blanket.<br> I've left a razor and soap<br> on the basin.<br> Listen to the opinions<br> of your man in the street.<br> They're perfectly entitled<br> to give an opinion...<br> ...on politics or whatever questions...<br> They've got no qualifications!<br> Of course they have!<br> Mr. Spencer would like<br> a word with you.<br> My good man,<br> I have a question for you.<br> Do you suppose the debt situation<br> regarding America...<br> ...factors significantly in the<br> present low levels of trade?<br> Or is this a red herring...<br> ...and the abandonment of the gold<br> standard is the cause of the problem?<br> I'm sorry, sir, but I am unable<br> to be of assistance in this matter.<br> Oh, dear.<br> What a pity.<br> Perhaps you'd help us<br> on another matter.<br> Do you think...<br> ...Europe's currency problem would be<br> alleviated by an arms agreement...<br> ...between the French<br> and the Bolsheviks?<br> I'm sorry, sir, but I'm unable<br> to be of assistance in this matter.<br> Very well, that'll be all.<br> One moment, Darlington, I have another<br> question to put to our good man here.<br> My good fellow...<br> ...do you share our opinion...<br> ...that M. Daladier's recent speech<br> on North Africa...<br> ...was simply a ruse...<br> ...to scupper the nationalist fringe<br> of his own domestic party?<br> I'm sorry, sir. I am unable<br> to help in any of these matters.<br> You see, our good man here is<br> "unable to assist us in these matters."<br> Yet we still go along<br> with the notion...<br> ...that this nation's decisions<br> be left to our good man here...<br> ...and a few millions like him.<br> You may as well ask the Mothers'<br> Union to organize a war campaign.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> You certainly proved your point.<br> - Q.E.D., I think.<br> - No, not at all!<br> Oh, yes, he has!<br> What did you make of the citizens<br> of Moscombe? Not a bad bunch.<br> No, sir.<br> Mr. And Mrs. Taylor<br> were extremely kind.<br> I say, I hope you don't<br> think me very rude...<br> ...but you aren't a manservant<br> of some sort, are you?<br> Yes, sir. I am, indeed.<br> In fact, I'm the butler<br> of Darlington Hall, near Oxford.<br> It wasn't my intention<br> to deceive anyone.<br> Don't explain.<br> I can see how it happened.<br> Darlington.<br> Wasn't there a<br> Lord Darlington involved...<br> ...in that appeasement business<br> that got us into the war?<br> Sorry, I never knew<br> that Lord Darlington.<br> My employer's an American<br> gentleman, Mr. Lewis.<br> Lord Darlington was among those who<br> tried to make a deal with Hitler.<br> Then there was a case after the war...<br> ...where he sued a newspaper<br> for libel.<br> "The Express", was it?<br> "News Chronicle"?<br> - I couldn't say, sir.<br> - Anyway, he lost.<br> He was lucky, really, not to have<br> been tried for treason.<br> There it is, just ahead.<br> Sir, I must confess...<br> ...that I failed to tell<br> you the truth.<br> I did know Lord Darlington, and I can<br> declare that he was a truly good man.<br> A gentleman through and through...<br> ...to whom I'm proud to have given<br> my best years of service.<br> That should get you<br> to the next petrol station.<br> Thank you very much, sir.<br> I'm most grateful.<br> But did you...<br> ...share his opinions?<br> Who?<br> Lord Darlington.<br> I was his butler.<br> I was there to serve him...<br> ...not to agree or disagree.<br> You trusted him.<br> Yes, I did. Completely.<br> But at the end of his life, he himself<br> admitted that he'd been... mistaken.<br> That he'd been too gullible,<br> and he'd let himself be taken in.<br> I see.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> You've been most kind.<br> Just keep going straight up here,<br> and turn left at the first crossroads.<br> I say, I don't want to be a bore,<br> but I'm intrigued.<br> Where do you stand on all that?<br> If a mistake was to be made, wouldn't<br> you rather have made your own?<br> Forgive me for being so inquisitive.<br> Not at all, sir.<br> In a very small way,<br> I did make my own mistake.<br> But I might have a chance<br> to set mine right.<br> In fact, I'm on my way<br> to try and do so now.<br> Try the ignition.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I'm most grateful for your help.<br> Good luck.<br> It's been interesting talking to you.<br> Good morning.<br> Lord Halifax was impressed<br> with the silver.<br> I told him it was all your doing.<br> Sent his compliments. Well done.<br> I've been meaning to ask you...<br> That business last year<br> about the Jewish maids...<br> ...I suppose there's no way<br> of tracing them?<br> That would be difficult. I tried<br> to get them a position in Surrey.<br> There was room only for one,<br> and they didn't want to be separated.<br> Well, try anyway. One would like<br> to do something for them.<br> It was wrong, what occurred.<br> I'm sorry about it. Very sorry.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> He asked about the Jewish girls.<br> - Elsa and Irma?<br> - He wondered where they were.<br> He said it was wrong<br> to dismiss them.<br> I remember you were<br> as distressed as I was about it.<br> As you were?<br> You thought it was right and proper<br> that they should be sent packing.<br> Now, really, that is most unfair.<br> Of course I was upset.<br> Very much so.<br> I don't like that happening here.<br> I wish you'd told me. It would've<br> helped me to know you felt as I did.<br> Why do you always have to hide<br> what you feel?<br> Have you finished the lavender bags?<br> Good.<br> All right.<br> I take my hat off to you.<br> That girl's come along very well.<br> You were right and I was wrong.<br> - Look at that smile on your face.<br> - What smile?<br> That tells a story in itself.<br> Wouldn't you say so?<br> What story's that?<br> She's a pretty girl, don't you think?<br> Is she?<br> You don't like pretty girls<br> on the staff. I've noticed.<br> Might it be that our Mr. Stevens<br> fears distraction?<br> Can it be that Mr. Stevens is flesh<br> and blood and cannot trust himself?<br> You know what I'm doing?<br> I'm placing my thoughts elsewhere<br> while you chatter away.<br> Why is that guilty smile<br> still on your face?<br> Not guilty, simply amused<br> by the nonsense you sometimes talk.<br> It is a guilty smile.<br> You can't bear to look at her.<br> You didn't want her.<br> She was too pretty.<br> You must be right.<br> You always are.<br> Charlie!<br> Lizzie, aren't you supposed to be<br> turning down the beds?<br> Well, you better get on with it, then.<br> Have you told her yet?<br> You better get on with it, then.<br> What can I say to her?<br> She'd never understand.<br> - Why not?<br> - She's old. She must be at least 30.<br> Perhaps she doesn't feel old.<br> Who do you think those flowers<br> are for she's been picking?<br> Come here. Give us a kiss.<br> Flowers.<br> You're reading.<br> It's very dim. Can you see?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> What are you reading?<br> A book.<br> Yes, but what sort of book?<br> It's a book, Miss Kenton.<br> A book.<br> What's the book?<br> Are you shy about your book?<br> What is it?<br> Is it racy?<br> Racy?<br> Are you reading a racy book?<br> Do you think racy books are to be<br> found in His Lordship's shelves?<br> How would I know?<br> What is it?<br> Let me see it.<br> Let me see your book.<br> Please leave me alone.<br> Why won't you show me your book?<br> This is my private time.<br> You're invading it.<br> Is that so?<br> I'm invading your private time,<br> am I?<br> What's in that book?<br> Come on, let me see.<br> Or are you protecting me?<br> Is that what you're doing?<br> Would I be shocked?<br> Would it ruin my character?<br> Let me see it.<br> Oh, dear.<br> It's not scandalous at all.<br> It's just a sentimental<br> old love story.<br> I read these books...<br> ...any books...<br> ...to develop my command and knowledge<br> of the English language.<br> I read to further my education,<br> Miss Kenton.<br> I really must ask you, please...<br> ...not to disturb the few moments<br> I have to myself.<br> Come in.<br> What is it?<br> I'm wanting to give you<br> my notice, please.<br> Why?<br> Charlie and me, we're getting married.<br> Have you thought about this carefully?<br> Yes, Miss Kenton, I have.<br> You've been getting on well here and<br> could have a fine career before you.<br> Charlie and me's getting married.<br> Charlie and I.<br> I wish I knew what to say to you.<br> I've seen this happen so many times.<br> A young girl rushing into marriage<br> only to be disappointed in the end.<br> What about money?<br> We don't have any.<br> But who cares?<br> You'll find it's not easy<br> to live poor.<br> We have each other.<br> That's all anyone can ever need.<br> Very well.<br> If you're so sure.<br> Thank you.<br> Good luck.<br> We did all we could for them.<br> I told him...<br> ...I had my eye on him<br> as a possible under-butler...<br> ...in a year or so.<br> But, no, Mr. Charlie knows best.<br> She's sure to be let down.<br> No use crying over spilt milk.<br> Besides, we have far more<br> important matters to discuss.<br> - Next week's meeting. Now...<br> - Must we discuss it tonight?<br> Sorry?<br> I'm tired.<br> I've had a busy day.<br> Don't you realize that?<br> I'm very tired.<br> I'm very, very tired.<br> Don't you understand?<br> I owe you an apology.<br> I thought...<br> ...these quiet evening talks<br> were useful to our work.<br> But now I see that they're<br> a burden to you.<br> I was only saying I was tired tonight.<br> No, no. You're right.<br> Our meetings are a burden<br> after a long day.<br> Perhaps we'd better discontinue them.<br> They're useful.<br> It was only tonight.<br> I thank you for the cocoa.<br> In the future, we shall communicate<br> only during the day.<br> If necessary, by written message.<br> I wish you a very good night.<br> I shall be taking my day off tomorrow.<br> I'll be back in the house by 9:30.<br> Certainly.<br> Certainly.<br> Good night.<br> I'm glad to be out of it,<br> I can tell you.<br> There was something about Sir Geoffrey<br> and his Black Shirts...<br> ...gave me the creeps.<br> Mr. Stevens says we should<br> run the house...<br> ...and leave the rest<br> where it belongs.<br> You don't agree, Mr. Benn.<br> Nor do l, really.<br> If I don't like something,<br> I want to say "stuff it"...<br> ...if you'll pardon the expression,<br> Miss Kenton.<br> But then I suppose I'm not<br> a real professional, like Mr. Stevens.<br> It's Mr. Stevens' whole life.<br> Well, it's not mine.<br> And to tell you the truth...<br> ...I don't want to go back in service.<br> - What would you do instead, Mr. Benn?<br> - Tom's the name.<br> Tom.<br> What employment would you take up?<br> I'd really like to be on my own.<br> Start a little shop somewhere,<br> newspapers and tobacco.<br> Or a boarding house in the<br> west country, where I come from.<br> Clevedon's a good place for<br> a boarding house.<br> Would I get you another shandy?<br> Well, it's almost 9:30...<br> Go on!<br> It's your day off, isn't it?<br> You're not in the army,<br> due back in the barracks.<br> - All right, then.<br> - Good.<br> Half a shandy, please.<br> What about yourself, then, Sarah?<br> That's a serious sort of a name.<br> They called me Sally<br> when my mum was alive.<br> Sally. That's nice.<br> Is it your intention<br> to remain in service?<br> It's a good profession,<br> when you have a position.<br> - Mr. Stevens says we're fortunate...<br> - We're not talking about him.<br> We're talking about you.<br> Supposing...<br> ...someone asked if you'd like to come<br> in on a boarding house by the sea?<br> What would you say?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> It's a theoretical question,<br> so I haven't given it any thought...<br> ...Mr. Benn.<br> - Tom.<br> Supposing it wasn't theoretical...<br> ...Sally?<br> It's been years since I've been<br> called that. It feels funny.<br> Nice, though?<br> It's very late.<br> Will there be anything else?<br> What?<br> - Thank you. Good night.<br> - Good night, my lord.<br> Mr. Cardinal, good evening.<br> - How are you?<br> - Very well.<br> - Delighted. And your wife?<br> - Very well too, sir.<br> - How are you?<br> - Very well, sir.<br> I've gone and got myself in a bit<br> of a mess with arrangements.<br> Would His Lordship put me up?<br> I'll tell him you're here.<br> I hope there's nothing special tonight.<br> His Lordship expects<br> some gentlemen after dinner.<br> I'll keep my head down, then.<br> I've got to write my column anyway.<br> - You're in time for dinner, if you like.<br> - I hoped I would be.<br> How is my godfather? Fit?<br> Very well. Some refreshment?<br> Thank you.<br> Some whisky would be lovely.<br> - Who's he expecting tonight?<br> - I am unable to help you there.<br> What, no idea?<br> No idea at all, sir.<br> - I'll keep my head down all the same.<br> - I think it's a good idea, sir.<br> Come in.<br> Mr. Cardinal has just arrived,<br> out of the blue.<br> He'll expect his usual room.<br> - I'll see to it before I leave.<br> - You're going out?<br> I am indeed.<br> It's Thursday.<br> Of course. I'd forgotten. Sorry.<br> Is something the matter?<br> Some visitors are arriving,<br> but it doesn't involve you.<br> We agreed that Thursday<br> is my day off...<br> ...but if you need me urgently...<br> No, it's perfectly all right.<br> Thank you.<br> I have something to tell you.<br> My friend...<br> ...the man I'm meeting, Mr. Benn.<br> Mr. Benn. Of course. Yes.<br> He has asked me to marry him.<br> I am thinking about it.<br> I see.<br> He's moving to the west country<br> next month.<br> I'm still thinking about it.<br> I thought you should be informed<br> of the situation.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> That's most kind of you.<br> I trust you'll have<br> a most pleasant evening.<br> Is there something special tonight?<br> Are your visitors special?<br> Can't tell you, my boy.<br> Strictly confidential.<br> - So I can't sit in on it?<br> - On what?<br> - Whatever it is that's taking place.<br> - Absolutely not.<br> Can't have someone like you sticking<br> your nose in. A journalist.<br> What do you call it, a "newshound"?<br> No, it wouldn't do at all.<br> Once you've had your food,<br> you'd better make yourself scarce.<br> It sounds pretty special to me.<br> Good evening, prime minister.<br> - Sorry, we've been delayed.<br> - I understand.<br> Lord Halifax.<br> - Very nice to see you.<br> - This is Mr. Fraser.<br> Good evening, Your Excellency.<br> Please wait here, Your Excellency.<br> I'll inform His Lordship.<br> We don't intend to involve<br> the whole British Empire in a war...<br> ...simply because of a quarrel<br> in a faraway country...<br> ...between people of whom<br> we know nothing.<br> To my mind, the whole<br> of Czechoslovakia...<br> ...isn't worth a single<br> one of our own young men.<br> We have a small, noisy<br> and corrupt war group here...<br> ...who don't realize that you Germans<br> are marching into your own back yard.<br> The "Fhrer" is a man of peace<br> to the depth of his soul...<br> ...but he won't allow<br> a small second-rate country...<br> ...to thumb its nose<br> at the 1000-year German Reich.<br> I'll get it.<br> Come on, wake up!<br> Stay awake!<br> Could you confirm that this lady<br> is on the staff here?<br> Yes, of course.<br> She's the housekeeper.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - May I?<br> - Of course.<br> Sorry to have alarmed you.<br> Just security, miss.<br> I trust you've had a pleasant evening.<br> Well, did you have a pleasant evening?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - Good.<br> Would you like to know<br> what took place?<br> I have to return upstairs.<br> There are important events<br> taking place tonight.<br> When are there not?<br> I accepted his proposal.<br> I accepted Mr. Benn's proposal<br> of marriage.<br> My congratulations.<br> I am prepared to serve out my notice.<br> But if you'd release me earlier,<br> I'd be grateful.<br> Mr. Benn is planning to leave<br> for the west country in two weeks.<br> I'll do my best.<br> Now, please excuse me.<br> After all the years I have been here,<br> you have nothing else to say?<br> You have my warmest congratulations.<br> You've been a very important figure...<br> ...for Mr. Benn and me.<br> Oh, in what way?<br> I tell him all sorts<br> of things about you.<br> I tell him stories about you.<br> About your habits.<br> About your mannerisms.<br> He finds it very funny,<br> especially when I show him how...<br> ...you pinch your nose<br> when you put pepper on your food.<br> That always has us in stitches.<br> Does it, indeed?<br> Well, please...<br> ...excuse me, Miss Kenton.<br> Good night.<br> Thanks.<br> We've been friends a long time,<br> haven't we?<br> I always look forward to a chat<br> when I come here.<br> Would you care to join me in a drink?<br> That's most kind of you,<br> but no, thank you.<br> You all right?<br> I'm perfectly all right.<br> Not feeling unwell, are you?<br> A little tired, perhaps.<br> I bet you're tired.<br> What is it, about 1:00?<br> Come on.<br> I want you to sit down.<br> Well, sir, I really...<br> I didn't come here by accident.<br> You know that.<br> I had a tip-off, you see...<br> ...about what's going on now<br> in the library.<br> I wish you'd sit down.<br> I'm your friend...<br> ...and you're holding that tray<br> as if you're about to wander off!<br> Now, come on.<br> Sit down, damn it!<br> That's better.<br> Now, look, I don't suppose the prime<br> minister is in the library, is he?<br> Prime minister, sir?<br> In the library...<br> You don't have to confirm it...<br> ...are our prime minister, our foreign<br> secretary and the German ambassador.<br> - Any idea what they're talking about?<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> Tell me, Stevens,<br> don't you care at all?<br> Aren't you in the least bit curious?<br> It's not my place to be curious<br> about such matters.<br> Not your place.<br> And supposing I told you<br> that His Lordship...<br> ...is trying to persuade<br> the prime minister...<br> ...to enter into a pact with that<br> bunch of criminals in Berlin?<br> I'm certain His Lordship is acting<br> from the highest and noblest motives.<br> Don't you see? That's exactly<br> what makes it so abominable!<br> Twisting these high and noble<br> motives to their own foul ends!<br> You do, please, realize<br> that His Lordship's been the most...<br> ...valuable pawn that the Nazis<br> have in this country...<br> ...precisely because he is good<br> and honourable?<br> If I weren't so drunk,<br> I could make you understand!<br> Sir...<br> ...I do understand.<br> His Lordship is working<br> to ensure peace in our time.<br> Peace in our time<br> on their beastly terms!<br> Remember that American here<br> at the conference?<br> Called Lord Darlington an amateur,<br> out of his depth?<br> Well, he was right.<br> He was dead right.<br> I hardly have to tell you<br> how I feel towards His Lordship.<br> I care about him deeply,<br> and I know you do too.<br> Yes, I do indeed.<br> Then aren't you desperate<br> to see him make this mistake?<br> He's being tricked! Don't you see?<br> Or are you as deluded as he is?<br> Oh, dear. Now I've probably<br> offended you.<br> No. Not at all, sir.<br> Not at all.<br> You must excuse me.<br> There are other gentlemen<br> calling for me, sir.<br> You mustn't take anything<br> I said to heart.<br> I was very foolish a little while ago.<br> I haven't taken anything<br> you said to heart.<br> In fact, I can hardly recall<br> anything you did say.<br> I was just being very foolish.<br> I simply haven't time to stand here<br> with you, engaging in idle talk.<br> I suggest you go to bed now.<br> You must be very tired.<br> Good night.<br> Oh, damn it!<br> Blast!<br> I'd been wanting to tell you...<br> It's the small alcove outside<br> the breakfast room.<br> It's the new girl, of course...<br> ...but I find it has not<br> been dusted in some time.<br> I'll see to it.<br> Thank you.<br> I knew you would have wanted<br> to be informed.<br> Hello, Sally.<br> Hi, Tom.<br> You all right, then?<br> How are you?<br> I'm good.<br> Could we talk for a moment, please?<br> Just for a moment.<br> We'll have to be quick<br> because I'm going out.<br> It won't take long.<br> All right, then.<br> We'll have to go into the lounge.<br> Afternoon.<br> Nice little place, isn't it?<br> The sort of quiet little<br> boarding house I had in mind for us.<br> Like other things, it didn't work out.<br> What did you want to say?<br> I saw Catherine yesterday.<br> She had some interesting news.<br> She's expecting.<br> Oh, my goodness!<br> She wants us both over<br> for tea on Sunday.<br> I could come and get you.<br> We could go together on the bus.<br> Yes, well, we'll see about that.<br> House is that empty without you.<br> I can't tell you.<br> You cut yourself shaving.<br> Oh, yeah. I know.<br> Can't seem to do anything right<br> these days.<br> I so often think<br> of the good old days...<br> ... when I was housekeeper<br> at Darlington Hall.<br> Those years with you<br> were the happiest of my life.<br> Would you like more tea?<br> Yes, please. Thank you.<br> Miss Kenton.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Benn.<br> - Sorry, I was delayed.<br> - That's all right.<br> Please sit down.<br> - I've ordered some fresh tea.<br> - Lovely.<br> Would you like some cake?<br> - Sure?<br> - All right. It's a special occasion.<br> Good.<br> Waitress?<br> - Could we have some cake?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - It's been a long time.<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> You haven't changed at all.<br> A little, perhaps.<br> We've all changed, I think.<br> I'd have known you anywhere.<br> How long's it been?<br> Twenty years?<br> Yes, just over, I think.<br> The tea should be along.<br> We read about the suit for libel.<br> It's a shame...<br> ...calling His Lordship a traitor.<br> Those papers will print anything.<br> They should have lost the case.<br> When His Lordship went to court...<br> ...he sincerely expected<br> he would get justice.<br> Instead, the newspaper increased<br> its circulation, and His Lordship's...<br> ...good name was destroyed forever.<br> Afterwards, in his last years, well...<br> ...quite honestly, Mrs. Benn...<br> ...his heart was broken.<br> I'd take him tea in the library,<br> and he'd be sitting there...<br> ...and he wouldn't even see me,<br> so deep was he in his own thoughts.<br> And he'd be talking to himself,<br> as though he was arguing with someone.<br> There was no one, of course.<br> No one came to see him anymore.<br> What about his godson,<br> young Mr. Cardinal?<br> Mr. Cardinal was killed in the war.<br> Waitress.<br> May I have my bill, please?<br> I'm very sorry.<br> I know you remember Darlington Hall<br> in its best days...<br> ...and that's how His Lordship<br> deserves to be remembered.<br> But perhaps the good days are back,<br> now that Mr. Lewis is here...<br> ...and Mrs. Lewis is arriving shortly.<br> Very fortunate to have you<br> running the house.<br> We still have problems, Miss Kenton.<br> I'm sorry. Mrs. Benn.<br> - We still have staff problems.<br> - You mentioned it in your letter.<br> Frankly, I've been thinking<br> of going back in service.<br> Good...<br> But now the situation<br> has changed for me.<br> If I take up any work,<br> it will have to be...<br> ...here in the west country...<br> ...because Catherine, our daughter,<br> is expecting a baby.<br> So I would like to be near her.<br> Of course.<br> And to be near our grandchild<br> as he grows up.<br> - Naturally.<br> - Or her, if it's a little girl.<br> When I left Darlington Hall,<br> all those years ago...<br> ...I never realized I was really,<br> truly leaving.<br> I believe I thought of it<br> as simply another ruse...<br> ...to annoy you.<br> It was a shock to come out here<br> and find myself actually married.<br> For a long time, I was...<br> ...very unhappy.<br> But then Catherine was born,<br> the years went by and one day...<br> ...I realized I loved my husband.<br> You see, there is no one...<br> ...no one in the world who needs me<br> as much as he does.<br> But still there are times...<br> ...when I think I made a terrible<br> mistake with my life.<br> I'm sure we all have these thoughts...<br> ...from time to time.<br> People always cheer when they turn<br> the lights on in the evening.<br> I wonder why.<br> They do say...<br> ...that for many people, the evening's<br> the best part of the day.<br> The part they most look forward to.<br> Is that so?<br> What do you most look forward to?<br> Getting back to Darlington Hall,<br> principally...<br> ...and straightening out<br> our staff problems.<br> You were always able to do that.<br> And you had quite a few<br> to straighten out, as I remember.<br> Always was work, work<br> and more work...<br> ...and will continue to be so,<br> I have no doubt.<br> Mr. Stevens, don't you wait!<br> That bus is always late.<br> Come in out of the wet.<br> You must take good care of yourself.<br> - You too, promise me that.<br> - Oh, yes, I promise.<br> Do all you can to make these years<br> happy for yourself and your husband.<br> We may never meet again, Mrs. Benn.<br> That is why I am being personal,<br> if you will forgive me.<br> Thank you, Mr. Stevens.<br> Oh, here it comes.<br> It's on time for once.<br> Thank you. And thank you<br> so very much for coming.<br> It was so very kind of you.<br> It was so nice to see you.<br> It was a pleasure to see you again.<br> Goodbye.<br> Take care.<br> You scared me.<br> Where'd you come from?<br> You like the suit?<br> Very good, sir.<br> Good.<br> Watch the chandelier there.<br> You're really getting things<br> going here. This is wonderful!<br> I've had to ask another three girls<br> from the village to come up.<br> And I can promise you that<br> the house will be ready...<br> ...and in shape by the time<br> Mrs. Lewis arrives.<br> That sounds good.<br> I'm expecting a possible<br> new housekeeper this afternoon.<br> A Mrs. Ruth Muspratt.<br> Excellent references. She was matron<br> at a boys' school in Sussex.<br> A matron?<br> Sounds like she'll keep us<br> from misbehaving.<br> - I certainly hope so, sir.<br> - Good.<br> Good, Stevens. Very good.<br> This is where we had that banquet<br> back in '35. Remember?<br> We all stood up and delivered<br> ourselves of our principles.<br> God knows what I said.<br> Sure got worked up about it, though.<br> What did I say, anyway?<br> I'm sorry, sir,<br> I was too busy serving...<br> ...to listen to the speeches.<br> We got a visitor here.<br> Be very careful.<br> Come here.<br> That's a boy. Come on.<br> Okay. Easy does it.<br> Come on!<br> You don't want to startle it.<br> It'll come down.<br> I think if we<br> leave the window open...<br> Good.<br> Very still.<br> Go on. Out!<br> Come on. Out!<br> Well done.<br> Well done, sir.<br>
