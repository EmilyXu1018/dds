I'm still going<br> upstairs like a bat out of hell.<br> We did it!<br> We finally broke the sound barrier.<br> We did it!<br> I want to place a long-distance<br> call to Los Angeles.<br> - Who are you calling?<br> - The press.<br> This is big news.<br> The sound barrier's been broken.<br> - No, sir. No press.<br> - What?<br> No word of this goes out.<br> This is big news.<br> We need coverage of this.<br> Sorry, no press.<br> Those are orders. National security.<br> But the war's over.<br> Look, pal, maybe they<br> don't want someone to know.<br> Who?<br> The Russians, maybe.<br> But they're our allies.<br> Well, anyway, someone figured it out<br> that way, and that's the way it is.<br> Chuck, you're our man!<br> You're the fastest man alive!<br> You'll fly more planes for us.<br> We want you to y all our planes!<br> What you been doing, hedgehopping?<br> Word will get out. Maybe not<br> to the press or the general public.<br> But soon, every fighter jock, rocket<br> ace, and rat-racer in the country...<br> ...will be headed this way, wanting<br> to push the outside of the envelope...<br> ...and get to the top of the pyramid.<br> I got a rocket in my pocket<br> And a roll in my walk<br> So, baby, don't fuss me<br> With that north 40 talk<br> Edwards Air Force Base.<br> This is the place to be.<br> They're going faster, farther<br> and higher than anywhere else.<br> Hey.

Now fire it in here.<br> Look at old Yeager.<br> On top of the pyramid<br> for five goddamn years.<br> Every time somebody goes faster,<br> he just goes up again.<br> He stays the fastest man alive.<br> You know...<br> ...sometimes...<br> ...all it takes is just the sound<br> of a truck starting.<br> I think:<br> That's the crash truck."<br> Anyway, I'm really glad we could talk.<br> I thought only I had nightmares.<br> Yeah, me too.<br> Nobody ever wants to talk<br> about anything around here.<br> Everybody's always trying to...<br> ..."maintain an even strain."<br> Well, you marry a fighter jock<br> and you marry the military.<br> I'll tell you one thing.<br> The military owes me for all this.<br> One day I expect the military<br> to make good.<br> Well, it sure ain't<br> your average dull life.<br> I went East for a reunion...<br> ...and my friends talked about<br> their husbands' work.<br> How dog-eat-dog and cutthroat it was...<br> ...on Madison Avenue, places like that.<br> Cutthroat?<br> I wondered how they would have felt...<br> ...if, when their husband<br> went to make a deal...<br> ...there was a one in four chance<br> he wouldn't come out of the meeting.<br> I'm going home to my folks<br> in San Diego.<br> What did Gordo say?<br> He "maintained an even strain."<br> Look at them.<br> You'd think they were talking about sports.<br> Men...<br> Sometimes they're just such assholes.<br> Sometimes they sure are<br> handy assholes, though.<br> Yeah, sometimes...<br> Sometimes.<br> Hey, honey.<br> You want a hot dog?<br> I'm leaving, Gordo.<br> You guys ready for hot dogs.<br> The buns ready.<br> Look at that.<br> Yeah, that's the D-558 Phase 2.<br> Scott Crossfield.<br> It sure as hell is. Jesus.<br> He scorched that one, didn't he?<br> He's pushing the outside of the envelope.<br> He must be going for a record.<br> He's shooting for Mach 2.<br> On the 50th anniversary<br> of the Wright brothers' historic flight...<br> ...another historic ight takes place,<br> as Scott Crossfield streaks...<br> ...across the skies over<br> the California desert.<br> Mach 2.<br> Almost 1500 miles per hour...<br> ...and a new world's record.<br> It's a field day for the press.<br> Congratulations from<br> a previous record holder...<br> ...as he shakes the hand<br> of the fastest man alive, Scott Crossfield.<br> And there's a comradeship of speed.<br> To Scott Crossfield,<br> the fastest man alive.<br> Compliments of Pancho's, Scotty.<br> The real test wasn't Mach 2.<br> I guess that demon lives out<br> at about 2.3 on your Mach meter.<br> But Mach 2 was the magic number.<br> Like 60 homers, like batting .400,<br> like the four-minute mile.<br> The press likes a nice round number.<br> After that, they don't care,<br> until the next magic number.<br> You need more than speed records.<br> You need coverage.<br> Coverage?<br> You mean them root weevils<br> that crawl around popping off cameras?<br> Those root weevils write history.<br> Let them write the history,<br> and let the pilots fly the planes.<br> Pilots.<br> You know what makes<br> your rocket ships go up?<br> The aerodynamics would take<br> so long to explain to you that...<br> Funding.<br> That's what makes them go up.<br> I'll tell you something.<br> And you guys too.<br> No bucks, no Buck Rogers.<br> Whoever gets the funding,<br> gets the technology.<br> Whoever gets the technology<br> stays on top.<br> Flyboy, let's dance.<br> I'll drink to that.<br> When an old friend I happened to see<br> I introduced her to my loved one<br> And while they were dancin'<br> My friend stole my sweetheart from me<br> I remember the night<br> He'll be going after<br> Crossfield soon, won't he?<br> No, he won't. He'll be going after<br> that demon that lives in the thin air.<br> Yes, I lost my little darlin'<br> The night they were playing<br> The beautiful Tennessee waltz<br> You got any Beemans?<br> Even before you hit Mach 2,<br> she'll be unforgiving on you.<br> Wring her out a little bit this time.<br> - You got any gum?<br> - Yeah, I got me a stick.<br> Loan me some.<br> I'll pay you back later.<br> - Fair enough.<br> - Thank you.<br> Okay, drop her.<br> All right, here we go again.<br> Three, two, one, drop.<br> Number 3 coming on.<br> Got seven seconds<br> on 150 right now.<br> I've got you in sight.<br> Going out of sight...<br> .

Do you read?<br> Damn! He's uncorked it.<br> Mayday! Mayday!<br> Alert all ground crews.<br> Talk to me!<br> Come in!<br> Can you read me?<br> I'm fighting bad here.<br> I'm down to 25,000 over Tehachapi.<br> I don't know if I can make it<br> back to base or not.<br> What happened?<br> Think I bust the canopy with my head.<br> I'm getting okay now.<br> We sure chased that old demon this time.<br> That's as fast as a man can go.<br> What's next, Ridley?<br> It's called Sputnik.<br> We know. Sit down.<br> And as I was saying...<br> ...whoever controls<br> the high ground of space...<br> ...will control the world.<br> The Roman Empire controlled<br> the world because it could build roads.<br> Later, the British Empire was<br> dominant because it had ships.<br> In the air stage, we were powerful<br> because we had the airplane.<br> Now the communists have established<br> a foothold in outer space.<br> Soon they'll have space platforms<br> to drop nuclear bombs on us...<br> ...like rocks from a highway overpass.<br> How the hell did they get ahead of us?<br> We're ready.<br> Is there a loose plug there?<br> Here it is. I'll get it.<br> Senator Johnson's right.<br> This is Armageddon.<br> The decisive battle<br> between good and evil.<br> It's a struggle for survival.<br> - There you go.<br> - Thank you.<br> This footage was assembled from sources<br> operating under deep cover at, uh, great risk.<br> Very great.<br> We're fortunate this material<br> did not perish with a couple of men.<br> This is secret footage...<br> ...of the Korabl rocket and the German<br> scientists they captured after the war.<br> Was it their German scientists<br> got them up first?<br> No. No it was not, senator.<br> Our Germans are better than theirs.<br> That's Titov on the right<br> and Gagarin on the left.<br> No, Titov's on the left,<br> Gagarin's on the right.<br> They bear a great<br> resemblance to each other.<br> If the Soviets ever do put a man<br> up there, it will be one of these two.<br> Most likely, the one on the left.<br> Isn't that their chief designer?<br> We know very little about him.<br> Let us see him again.<br> They've developed a program<br> of stupendous dimensions...<br> ...and he is the genius behind it.<br> I, for one, do not intend to go to sleep...<br> ...by the light of a Communist moon.<br> Get that moron off of there!<br> Drapes, please.<br> We could have orbited<br> a satellite a year ago...<br> ...if we had been allowed.<br> Now we must get something up there<br> quick and dirty, any way at all.<br> Well, what?<br> By combining our available rockets...<br> ...the Redstone, the Atlas...<br> I agree that we could launch a pod.<br> A Dot?<br> A pod.<br> A capsule. Now, we will be<br> in full control of this pod.<br> It will go up like a cannonball,<br> and come down like a cannonball...<br> ...splashing down in the ocean...<br> ...with a parachute to spare<br> the life of the specimen inside.<br> Spaceman?<br> Specimen.<br> Well, what kind of "specimen"?<br> A tough one.<br> Responsive to orders.<br> I had in mind a "jimp."<br> Jimp? Well, what the hell is a jimp?<br> A chimp. A chimpanzee, senator.<br> An ape.<br> The first American in space<br> is not going to be a chimpanzee.<br> Who would you put into space,<br> Mr. President?<br> We have film of some people<br> we think are strong candidates.<br> We'd like to run it<br> and stimulate some thinking.<br> - May we?<br> - Okay.<br> These are people we felt would<br> be excellent in the splashdown.<br> We like the one on the right.<br> No, on the left.<br> These people are experienced<br> with machinery and have their own helmets.<br> Is that a factor?<br> As you'll see, they're quite<br> comfortable in conditions of flame.<br> Now, uh, this is, uh, personnel...<br> ...who have very<br> well-developed equilibrium.<br> - Good middle ear.<br> - Also very nice people.<br> Very easy to work with.<br> With some work, they could be<br> very responsive to orders.<br> This is my first choice.<br> The man with the hood.<br> Since he works without eyesight,<br> his other senses are sharpened.<br> In space there'll be little need<br> for eyeballing at any rate.<br> The cannonball effect you mentioned...<br> We're thinking about...<br> ...putting a couple into orbit.<br> Adds emotional stability.<br> This individual has many plus factors.<br> Ease with flames, comfort at heights...<br> ...and, uh, agility in the splashdown.<br> Also, he is available on the 15th.<br> No. No, no.<br> I want test pilots.<br> No, you can't deal with them.<br> I'm sure we can do better<br> with another type of man...<br> ...any other type of man.<br> A more manageable type.<br> It will only complicate things.<br> With a man we must guarantee<br> a safe return.<br> Mr. President, I think<br> you'd be wise to reconsider.<br> No, Lyndon.<br> Test pilots?<br> We'll be heading for some air bases.<br> Not just some air bases.<br> There's only one place to go.<br> I was there once before<br> and I hoped I'd never have to go back.<br> It's a god-forsaken spot on the roof<br> of the high desert in California.<br> A prehistoric throwback<br> of an airfield called Edwards.<br> They've got a weird mad-monk squadron.<br> They live in rat shacks,<br> terrible conditions.<br> Corrugated tin, bare bones, low rent.<br> This is where they hang out.<br> Pancho's Happy Bottom Riding Club.<br> It's called Happy Bottom Riding Club?<br> How'd it get a name like that?<br> Ask Pancho.<br> - Lock up?<br> - Yeah.<br> We're meeting the liaison officer.<br> They are expecting us.<br> Who's "they"?<br> The best...<br> Give me that.<br> The best test pilots in the world.<br> They got some kind of brotherhood.<br> They think they got the right stuff.<br> What stuff? Heroism, bravery?<br> There any snakes around here?<br> Yeah. In the bushes.<br> Heroism and bravery are part of it.<br> But, uh, there's more to it.<br> What do they say it means?<br> They don't say anything.<br> They don't talk about it.<br> They don't talk to outsiders?<br> To each other.<br> To outsiders they say even less.<br> Anyway, they're all here,<br> including the, uh, ace of aces himself.<br> Who's that?<br> Yeager.<br> Never heard of him.<br> These must be our gentlemen<br> from Washington...<br> ...scouting for astronauts.<br> Welcome to Edwards.<br> Scouting for lab rabbits, more likely.<br> I didn't hear you.<br> I said "lab rabbits."<br> What's that mean?<br> It means you don't need<br> honest-to-God pilots.<br> You need a lab rabbit<br> to curl up in your capsule...<br> ...with its heart beating...<br> ...and wire up the kazoo.<br> I don't hold with it.<br> I don't either.<br> You want a pilot to be<br> a ballistic missile, then splash down.<br> Possibly get lost at sea.<br> There's some things you can't change.<br> Some peckervvood's<br> got to take the beast up.<br> And some peckerwood's got to land it.<br> And that peckerwood is called a pilot.<br> You're mighty right.<br> The boys smell panic in your program.<br> That's one thing they don't respond to.<br> Now maybe if we talk privately<br> to Yeager and some of the other boys...<br> Anybody goes up in the damn<br> thing's gonna be Spam in a can.<br> Yeager doesn't fit the profile.<br> Yeager doesn't fit?<br> He didn't go to college.<br> We're only taking college personnel.<br> Forget about Walker and Crossfield<br> and the other civilian pilots too.<br> The security clearance just takes<br> too long with those people.<br> Besides, they seem<br> a little too independent.<br> You mean for this space race<br> you don't want our best pilots?<br> I didn't say that.<br> We want the best pilots<br> that we can get.<br> Hey-<br> Y'all want some whiskey?<br> No, thanks, Fred.<br> Just a little coffee.<br> - I'd like a Coca-Cola.<br> - Coke?<br> Mm-hm. In a clean glass.<br> There's an old saying:<br> Never refuse a combat assignment."<br> Well, uh, there sure is a long line<br> of shit-hot rocket aces around here.<br> Hey, Hot Dog, what the hell's<br> astronaut" mean anyway?<br> Star voyager.<br> Star voyager Gus Grissom.<br> I like the sound of that.<br> Now your name is?<br> My name, Jos Jimenez.<br> Who are we gonna get<br> to take on the Russians?<br> Have you seen this Jose Jimenez?<br> He's a crack-up.<br> I am the chief astronaut<br> of the United States interplan-<br> My name, Jos Jimenez.<br> I see you have your<br> space equipment with you.<br> Is that the crash helmet?<br> Oh, I hope not.<br> Get that guy off.<br> The country's already laughing at us.<br> Eddie Hodges.<br> This is the show I wanted you to see.<br> Who, that kid?<br> And his partner...<br> ...winner of five<br> Distinguished Flying Crosses...<br> ...and holder of the coast-to-coast,<br> nonstop, supersonic flight record...<br> ...from the U.S. Marine Corps...<br> - ...Major John Glenn!<br> - That guy.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Can you tell us what's that song?<br> Straighten Up and Fly Right."<br> It's "Straighten Up and Fly Right."<br> He's not dumb.<br> Major, Eddie here has a little<br> problem with his girlfriend.<br> Did you ever have a problem<br> like that when you were 10?<br> Yes, I did, Bob.<br> I liked a girl in my class, but...<br> ...other guys liked her<br> and she didn't pay attention.<br> But I kept after her, Eddie.<br> Did you finally get her to notice you?<br> Yes, I did. In fact, I finally<br> got her to marry me.<br> They love the guy.<br> Mm-hm.<br> Delta Charlie 9, you are clear to land...<br> ...at 180 degrees.<br> Jos Jimenez on approach.<br> Say again.<br> My name, Jos Jimenez.<br> Yeah, Shepard, I forgot.<br> You are clear at 180 degrees.<br> Some boys here want to talk to you<br> about being an astronaut.<br> They want to make me an astronaut?<br> Oh, I hope not.<br> Are you sure the Navy's got good pilots?<br> The Navy calls them aviators.<br> They say they're better than pilots.<br> I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.<br> - What?<br> - I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.<br> Just who we came to see.<br> Well, it's a pleasure.<br> You've heard about our project.<br> We're going up against the Russians.<br> It's got the highest...<br> Priority.<br> It's a hazardous...<br> "undertaking.<br> It's extremely hazardous.<br> It's so hazardous<br> that if, uh, you decide not to volunteer...<br> ...it will not be held against you.<br> Sounds dangerous.<br> - It is. Very.<br> - It's very dangerous.<br> Count me in.<br> There's nothing to worry about.<br> Absolutely nothing.<br> Mm. Ugh.<br> Why are you doing this to me?<br> I'm afraid there's no simple<br> way to explain that to you.<br> It's nothing to worry about.<br> Thank you, Number 21.<br> Hmm?<br> Number 22, please.<br> You're gonna love it.<br> Please, sit right there.<br> Put your arm right up here.<br> Excuse me, you John Glenn?<br> Yes.<br> - Scott Carpenter.<br> - Hi.<br> I recognize you from those TV shows.<br> I like them.<br> I had a good time doing them.<br> I guess we're, um, both here<br> for the same reason.<br> Yeah.<br> You know what they've got planned?<br> - Uh, no. Let me check it out.<br> - Okay.<br> What have you got scheduled?<br> We're not really free to<br> reveal all the testing.<br> I don't get this. Sending us<br> down here disguised as civilians.<br> Come on, Gus, cut it out. What the hell...?<br> This entire operation's<br> supposed to be hush-hush.<br> We got top secret orders to blend in<br> with the patients. So shut up.<br> Might be Russian agents here.<br> They don't look very Russian to me, Gus.<br> All we got here is your<br> local gentry, and, uh...<br> ...then you got Navy and<br> Marine pilots over here.<br> None of these guys is up<br> to Air Force standards.<br> I hear they got some 50-some guys<br> trying out for seven spots.<br> After they pick us three,<br> there's only gonna be four spots.<br> Sounds right to me. Where do we go next?<br> You go in that door.<br> Who are you?<br> My name, Jos Jimenez.<br> You talking to us, buddy?<br> All Air Force pilots go in that door.<br> When they all go in...<br> ...they all look the same.<br> But when they all come out...<br> ...they all look different.<br> How's that?<br> Fellow, I said how's that?<br> When they all come out,<br> they all look scared.<br> Buenos dias, yourself.<br> Oh, there you are. Come this way.<br> That guy didn't fool me a bit.<br> That Mexican guy?<br> That guy's Navy all the way.<br> There's another swabbo.<br> I'll open the box a little<br> so you can see.<br> Don't put your fingers in there.<br> This thing will bite them off.<br> It's vicious.<br> Swabbo sense of humor.<br> Let's see what there is<br> to be scared about back here.<br> The ball must be maintained<br> in the position between these two lines.<br> You may begin now.<br> The record is 91 seconds.<br> Ha!<br> Ninety-three seconds.<br> Read it and weep.<br> Terrific, Scott. Darn good!<br> You were probably just<br> getting warmed up.<br> Next time I doubt I'll win.<br> I don't know about that.<br> It's Archie and Jughead.<br> Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out!<br> Please. Please. Let me out.<br> Let me out. Let me out.<br> Let me out, please. Let me out.<br> Two-nine.<br> Gus, I got this<br> whole thing figured out.<br> The drill here...<br> Number three.<br> The drill here is to see who can<br> drill the brains out of Nurse Murch.<br> Nineteen.<br> You're nuts. She thinks we're<br> all just miserable pudknockers.<br> This is one fighter jock<br> who is not a miserable pudknocker.<br> She's a woman, susceptible<br> to charms like all of the rest.<br> Hi, doc.<br> You want what in there?<br> Sperm.<br> What for?<br> Sperm motility factors.<br> Yeah, but, uh, nurse, uh,<br> how am I, uh, supposed to, uh...<br> The best results seem to be<br> obtained through fantasization...<br> ...accompanied by masturbation,<br> followed by ejaculation.<br> Mm.<br> That sounds easy enough.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> If I get stuck, you mind coming in<br> and helping me out a little bit?<br> Please return it to the lab.<br> Um...<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, God.<br> Hey, cut out the humming in there.<br> Great.<br> Okay, knock it off in there.<br> Okay, Glenn, I know that's you.<br> Just knock it off, because I'm<br> trying to concentrate in here.<br> That was quick.<br> There's plenty more of that.<br> You want to see me again?<br> I'd like to meet your wife.<br> Uh, my wife?<br> You're married, aren't you?<br> Uh, yeah, sure, I'm married all right.<br> Happily?<br> Yeah. A real stable relationship too.<br> I'd like to meet your wife.<br> You'd like to meet my wife.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow?<br> Um...<br> Tomorrow's no good.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Good golly, Miss Molly<br> I need you, Trudy.<br> I'm talking about a whole<br> new ball game.<br> Fresh start.<br> This astronaut thing is the best way<br> for us to move up that ladder.<br> If we play our cards right,<br> we go to the top.<br> We? You mean you.<br> I mean we.<br> We're a team.<br> Have I ever let you down?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah?<br> Trudy.<br> Who's the best pilot you ever saw?<br> Huh?<br> Huh?<br> You're looking at him.<br> I know. I know, I know.<br> You're all set. I told her you were<br> stable, well-adjusted, attentive.<br> - I lied.<br> - Attagirl.<br> What'd she say?<br> She laughed.<br> She knows you too well, Gordo.<br> Let's face it. Some women<br> just have a problem with men.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> At secret locations across America...<br> ...56 of our greatest pilots<br> are at this moment...<br> ...vying to be one of the first men...<br> ...to go into space.<br> These are the most...<br> ...up-to-date tests imaginable...<br> ...and the most rigorous physical<br> testing ever done on humans.<br> They're being subjected to every stress<br> our doctors and engineers can invent.<br> These men are preparing themselves<br> for the ordeal of capsule life.<br> They will be guiding a new machine...<br> ...through a hostile environment.<br> They will be faced with emergencies<br> no man can foresee.<br> Many are called,<br> but few will be chosen.<br> These are men who will have to<br> face any danger for their country.<br> No individual will have ever been<br> so adequately prepared for an event.<br> Each man knows that whoever<br> survives this competition...<br> ...is destined to become<br> a legend in his own time.<br> Here, hold this.<br> And hold this like this.<br> When the clamp is released,<br> the balloon inside you deflates.<br> Where's the john?<br> Two floors up. Gonzales will take<br> you there, but wait here with him.<br> Gonzales.<br> How's it going, Gonzales?<br> - Gonzales?<br> - Hmm.<br> Faster!<br> Jesus.<br> Good day, commander.<br> You prick.<br> As you were.<br> Push the button.<br> Let's go. Just hold on to this.<br> Come on, come on, come on.<br> Jesus. Hurry up.<br> No, no, no.<br> You know, Mr. Shepard...<br> ...me and my friends think your<br> Jose Jimenez imitation...<br> ...is A-okay. But what you're<br> doing with it is b-a-d.<br> You're right, you're absolutely right.<br> Open. Open.<br> Tell me something, Mr. Gonzales.<br> You ever have any<br> explosions doing this?<br> All the time. It's a mess.<br> Mm.<br> Tell me something else, Mr. Gonzales.<br> How am I doing?<br> I think you're gonna make it.<br> I think you're gonna be an astronaut.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> After a long...<br> ...and unprecedented<br> series of evaluations...<br> ...which told our medical scientists...<br> ...of their superb adaptability<br> to their upcoming ight...<br> ...it is my pleasure<br> to introduce to you...<br> ...seven Americans...<br> ...gentlemen all.<br> Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom!<br> Leroy G. Cooper!<br> Donald K. Slayton!<br> John H. Glenn, Junior!<br> Malcom S. Carpenter!<br> Alan B. Shepard, Junior!<br> Walter M. Schirra, Junior!<br> America's Mercury astronauts!<br> Holy shit.<br> Smile, Gus. We're heroes.<br> Yeager ought to see this.<br> Seven rookies being installed<br> as the hottest fliers...<br> ...and they haven't done a thing<br> but show up for a press conference.<br> Following distribution of the kits,<br> those of you who have p.m. deadlines...<br> ...better dash to your phones.<br> Now we'll have some questions<br> from the press, please.<br> I'd like to know<br> whether your wives and children...<br> ...had anything to say.<br> Mr. Slayton?<br> Ahem. Uh... Uh...<br> Mine think it's fine.<br> Thank you. Mr. Schirra?<br> They're all for it.<br> I don't think any of us<br> could do something like this...<br> ...if we didn't have pretty good<br> backing at home.<br> My wife's attitude has been the same<br> as it's been all through my flying.<br> If it's what I want to do,<br> she's behind it.<br> And, by golly,<br> my kids are too, 100 percent.<br> I don't believe this.<br> But look at them out there.<br> They're eating it up.<br> Uh-huh.<br> I believe you are placed on earth...<br> ...more or less<br> with a fifty-fifty proposition.<br> This is what I still believe.<br> We're placed here with certain<br> talents and capabilities...<br> ...and it's up to us<br> to use those talents as best we can.<br> And if we use our talents properly...<br> ...I think there is a power<br> greater than us that will place...<br> ...the opportunity in our way.<br> When I think of<br> Orville and Wilbur Wright...<br> ...standing on a hill at Kitty Hawk...<br> ...tossing a coin to see which one<br> would take the first airplane ight...<br> ...and then I think of us today...<br> ...I thank God I live in a country...<br> ...where the best and finest<br> in a man can be brought out.<br> I mean it. Thank you.<br> I'd like to, uh, second some of the things<br> Mr. Glenn has said here.<br> I think that we are all very,<br> very fortunate...<br> ...that we have been, uh,<br> should we say, "blessed"...<br> ...with the talents<br> for something like this.<br> And I think that we would be<br> most remiss in our duty indeed...<br> ...if we did not volunteer<br> for something as important as this is...<br> ...to our country...<br> ...and to the world<br> in general right now.<br> One of our Air Force boys.<br> Don't you agree, Deke?<br> I absolutely agree with Gordo.<br> But we're not saying anything new.<br> We're just saying the same things...<br> ...that need to be said again<br> and again with fierce conviction.<br> Can you tell us if any of you<br> go to church regularly?<br> Yes.<br> As far as church goes,<br> I attend regularly.<br> Uh, which one of you will be<br> the first into space?<br> The best will be first.<br> Share it, brother.<br> Fucking A, Bubba.<br> This is for America's Life magazine.<br> Ah, that's it. That's it.<br> Mrs. Grissom. Mrs. Grissom.<br> Good, good, good.<br> These are the greatest pilots<br> in America.<br> How much do they make?<br> Seven, $8000 a year?<br> Hmm.<br> With this one deal...<br> ...I'm giving them $500,000<br> split seven ways over three years.<br> How's that sound?<br> Now I want them all to meet my people<br> who will write their true stories.<br> These stories will appear<br> in Life under their own by-lines.<br> For example...<br> "...by Betty Grissom..."<br> ...or, "by...<br> "...Virgil I. Grissom."<br> Gus.<br> - What was that?<br> - Gus.<br> Nobody calls me by that other name.<br> Gus? An astronaut named Gus?<br> - What's your middle name?<br> - Ivan.<br> Ivan.<br> Maybe...<br> ..."Gus" isn't so bad.<br> Might be something there.<br> All right, you can be Gus.<br> I bet for all that money<br> they could call you Virgil.<br> They sure could me.<br> Well, what's with her?<br> She seems snobby.<br> I don't get it.<br> I get it. She's Mrs. Clean Marine.<br> I'm going to the Cape tomorrow.<br> I wish to heck it wasn't<br> off-limits to wives.<br> There's so much work to do, anyway.<br> More tests...<br> ...training...<br> ...studying.<br> What about after?<br> After hours I'll run.<br> I'm going to get up to five miles a day.<br> There's a beautiful, long beach there.<br> It's called Cocoa Beach.<br> You can run forever.<br> Scott Carpenter will run with me.<br> He's a good guy.<br> Hmm.<br> He's real philosophical.<br> What about...?<br> The others want to get the job done<br> and keep the Mickey Mouse to a minimum.<br> They're good men.<br> Good men.<br> They'll give 100 percent<br> when the time comes.<br> Guess they think I'm kind of a...<br> ...gung-ho type.<br> Eddie Attaboy.<br> Harry Hairshirt.<br> What, you agree?<br> You agree?<br> My own wife.<br> Do you think I'm a Dudley Doright?<br> Do you? Yeah?<br> That's me, I guess.<br> A lonely beacon of restraint...<br> and self-sacrifice<br> in a squall of car-crazies.<br> It's important to America<br> to get a man up there first.<br> I plan to be the first man<br> to ride the rocket.<br> Nine, eight...<br> ...seven, six, five, four,<br> three, two, one, ignition.<br> Four, three, two, one, zero.<br> What is the most<br> important thing in rocket travel?<br> To me the most important thing...<br> ...is the blast-off.<br> I always take a blast before I take off.<br> Otherwise I wouldn't go near it.<br> He loves Ed Sullivan.<br> Ed Sullivan? Oh, yeah. Heh.<br> I only have eyes<br> For you<br> You are here And so am I<br> Four down, three to go.<br> But they all disappear<br> From view<br> And I only have eyes<br> For you<br> I don't want this program<br> put in a bad light.<br> We have the opportunity of a lifetime<br> and I won't stand by and let...<br> ...other people compromise<br> the whole darned thing!<br> This could lead to<br> something very unfortunate.<br> What's ticking you off?<br> I'm talking about playing around.<br> I'm talking about the young girls...<br> ...the cookies.<br> About keeping our pants zipped<br> and our wicks dry.<br> Mr. Glenn, you are way out of line.<br> I advise you<br> not to try to foist your moral views...<br> ...on anyone else in this group.<br> Each man here has<br> volunteered to do a job...<br> ...devoting long hours of training...<br> ...and doing things above and beyond<br> the call of duty...<br> ...such as morale tours...<br> Such as bringing girls up to your room?<br> And forgoing any orderly family life.<br> As long as a man uses good sense...<br> ...what he does with his wick<br> is his own business!<br> I'm from Life magazine.<br> I'm not with these people.<br> You can't go in. They're<br> discussing science.<br> John's right.<br> We're public figures.<br> Whether we deserve it or not,<br> people look up to us.<br> We have a tremendous responsibility.<br> You can't tell a pilot what to do<br> when not flying.<br> Wait a minute. You got it all wrong.<br> The issue here ain't pussy.<br> The issue here is monkey.<br> - What?<br> - Us. We are the monkey.<br> Gus is saying that<br> we're missing the point.<br> Gus is saying...<br> ...we heard they want<br> to send a monkey up first.<br> They're sending a monkey up<br> to do a man's work.<br> Gus is saying...<br> ...they're trying to send a man up<br> to do a monkey's work.<br> Us. A bunch of<br> college-trained chimpanzees.<br> Gus is saying...<br> ...we've got to change things.<br> He's saying that we are pilots.<br> We know more about what we need<br> to fly than anybody else.<br> What we have to do is<br> alter the experiment.<br> It comes down to who is going<br> to control this thing from here on.<br> Gus is saying<br> we've got to stick together.<br> These tests were designed...<br> ...to decondition, to desensitize...<br> ...to adapt out fears.<br> Since we have developed<br> a fully automated vehicle...<br> ...all we seek from the occupants...<br> ...of the capsule is data.<br> The so-called...<br> ...astronaut would merely be<br> a redundant component.<br> The chimps are capable of many<br> of the same tasks as men.<br> And they are much more cooperative.<br> They are being put through every phase<br> of the astronaut training.<br> For us, the question still remains:<br> Which one will be first?<br> The man or...<br> ...the monkey?<br> We shall see.<br> Take it easy with that.<br> Uh, where are you putting the window?<br> Window? There is no window.<br> No window?<br> What about the hatch?<br> - The hatch?<br> - Yeah, the hatch.<br> We need a hatch with explosive bolts<br> we can open ourselves.<br> There's something you don't understand.<br> This is the final form of the capsule.<br> No hatch.<br> What if the automatic controls went out?<br> With backups, checks,<br> this would not happen.<br> I said, what would happen if it did?<br> - The pilot would have to fly it back.<br> - This is the way it is.<br> I wonder how the press<br> will feel about this.<br> The press? What does the press<br> have to say about this?<br> Do you know what makes<br> this bird go up?<br> Funding makes this bird go up.<br> That's right.<br> No bucks, no Buck Rogers.<br> And, uh, the press over there...<br> They all want to see Buck Rogers.<br> And that's us. Buck Rogers.<br> Those fellows over there<br> have been making us out...<br> ...as the seven finest and bravest<br> pilots in all America.<br> If the story would<br> come out in the press...<br> ...that we can't fly as pilots...<br> We want a window.<br> There could, maybe, be...<br> ...in future capsules a window...<br> ...here.<br> No, that's where the hatch<br> with explosive bolts goes.<br> The hatch with the explosive...<br> There could be a hatch<br> with explosive bolts on the capsule.<br> That is a spacecraft, sir.<br> We do not refer to it as a capsule.<br> Spacecraft.<br> A hatch with explosive<br> bolts on the spacecraft.<br> And there will be pitch and yaw<br> thrusters to enable the occupant...<br> The pilot.<br> Astronaut-pilot.<br> The astronaut...<br> ...pilot...<br> ...to have some...<br> To have...<br> ...control...<br> ...of the re-entry procedures.<br> We appreciate it.<br> You wouldn't mind if we had the press<br> to take a few photos of us, would you?<br> Good idea, John.<br> Look, Glenn's waving us in.<br> What's your problem, huh?<br> Which one of you is going<br> to be the first one...<br> ...to be launched into space?<br> Smile. Okay, that's it.<br> Here he is.<br> Captain Ham.<br> Grinning like a possum<br> eating a sweet potato.<br> Does he look like he'd put<br> doo-doo in the capsule?<br> Ham in a can.<br> Off we go in a wild blue yonder<br> Climbing high into the sun<br> Here they come<br> Zooming to meet our thunder<br> At 'em boys Give 'er the gun<br> They've got a man up there. It's Gagarin.<br> We know. Sit down.<br> All right, give them a break.<br> Is it true you were ready to go<br> and the flight was canceled?<br> Could we have beaten the Russians?<br> Why didn't we send a man up<br> instead of a monkey?<br> I think we ought to be...<br> ...forthright, gracious,<br> and magnanimous and say...<br> ...the Russians beat the pants off us.<br> No sense in kidding ourselves.<br> The space age has begun,<br> and there's plenty of work.<br> Who will be the second man in space?<br> You mean who will be the first<br> free man into space?<br> We know it'll be Glenn.<br> Just tell us when.<br> That's a secret.<br> I'm tired of being forthright,<br> gracious, and magnanimous.<br> I'm tired of stupid questions<br> from the press.<br> I'm tired of smocks, of engineers<br> telling us what we can't do...<br> ...of people saying we are not pilots.<br> I'm tired of monkeys.<br> Most of all, I'm tired<br> of being second to those...<br> Those darned Russians. It's time we...<br> Got someone up there.<br> Fucking A, Bubba.<br> Exactly.<br> Let's get this thing on the road.<br> I'm tired of messing around.<br> We'll just tell them we're ready.<br> We're ready to go.<br> In these three weeks<br> since Gagarin's surprise ight...<br> ...one wretched event<br> has followed another.<br> People have begun to say<br> our rockets always blow up...<br> ...our boys always botch it.<br> Some say this is not the time to try...<br> "desperate deeds to beat the Soviets.<br> The question really is:<br> Are we actually ready<br> to launch a man into space?<br> And yet out here sits a rocket,<br> waiting in the night.<br> Soon, one American astronaut<br> will climb atop that rocket...<br> ...in the greatest death-defying<br> stunt ever broadcast.<br> The identity of America's<br> first astronaut...<br> ...was not revealed until the final<br> moment, and everyone has asked:<br> Which one will be first?<br> Not very funny, John.<br> No?<br> But I do appreciate it, John.<br> I surely do.<br> Dear Lord, please don't let me fuck up.<br> I didn't quite copy that.<br> Say again, please.<br> I said, everything's A-okay.<br> Well, that's what I thought you said.<br> He said everything is A-okay.<br> He says everything is A-okay.<br> And there you have it.<br> All stations...<br> Roger.

Stop it.<br> We don't have a diaper-service man.<br> Get back from the door. I don't know.<br> - Oh, my Lord.<br> - Oh, Louise, your lawn!<br> Leave those diapers alone. Come on.<br> Shut that door!<br> Why are they here?<br> What do they want?<br> We are here at the house<br> of Louise Shepard...<br> ...wife of Al Shepard,<br> who is about to go into space.<br> Yes.<br> Wanted to keep you<br> informed, Mrs. Shepard.<br> Everything's A-okay. Nothing<br> to worry about. Just some delays.<br> What kind of delays?<br> There's another hold from NASA,<br> another delay.<br> And Alan Shepard sits<br> there patiently waiting.<br> What can be going through<br> a man's mind at this moment?<br> Gordo.<br> I have to urinate.<br> Urinate?<br> Urinate? No.<br> We did not think of that.<br> This is only a 15-minute flight.<br> The man's been up there for hours.<br> Could he do it in his suit?<br> That's dangerous.<br> To introduce liquid...<br> ...into the pure oxygen of the capsule<br> and the pressure suit...<br> ...might cause a short circuit.<br> It could start a fire.<br> No. Tell him he cannot.<br> Listen, they promise we'll<br> stop at the next gas station.<br> Request that you remain<br> in a holding pattern till then.<br> You sure you just want a little smidgen?<br> - About a half a cup.<br> - Nothing in it?<br> - That's fine.<br> - All right.<br> Alan had four cups of coffee<br> before he went to work today.<br> All this waiting is driving me crazy.<br> I had a little accident.<br> Request permission to relieve bladder.<br> Gordo?<br> Gordo?<br> Look, the man has got to go.<br> It's either that or we get the<br> lug wrench and pry him out.<br> Do it in the suit.<br> Jos, permission granted...<br> ...to wet your diapers anytime, son.<br> Mm.<br> Freon flow jumping from...<br> ...30 to 45.<br> Left lower chest sensor.<br> No shortcut.

What was Jackie like?<br> Very nice.<br> We talked about all kinds of things.<br> My Gus goes up next. I can't wait<br> to talk to Jackie after that.<br> You'll love her. She's so nice.<br> We talked about the kids.<br> - Oh, Alan, hi.<br> - Mr. Shepard.<br> Mr. Shepard, sign here.<br> Oh, Gus.<br> I never realized...<br> ...a gruff, mean son of a bitch<br> like you could be so popular.<br> How'd you get to go up there before me?<br> Even before Mr. Clean, the Marine.<br> Charm, Hot Dog.

How are you doing?<br> I ain't doing anymore.<br> Thing's dragging in the mud,<br> and I can't get it up.<br> That's pure charm.<br> How'd you like one of these?<br> I can get one of those<br> from a dime store.<br> Not one that's been in outer space.<br> I'm taking these up with me tomorrow.<br> Would you like a souvenir<br> after I get written in history?<br> Well, I might,<br> if it's been in outer space.<br> See you after outer space.<br> All right.<br> Hey, Hot Dog. Listen.<br> You got to look to the future.<br> Folks have a taste for things<br> that have been there.<br> Right.<br> I'll give you one of these dimes<br> I'm taking up so you can play with it...<br> ...and dream about outer space.<br> Why don't you just make sure<br> you don't screw the pooch?<br> Oh, God, look at this.<br> Go get them, Deke.<br> Grissom<br> has just reached the apex of his ight.<br> He will be re-entering the atmosphere now.<br> Liberty Bell 7, Liberty Bell 7,<br> this is Hunt Club 1. Over.<br> We're in orbit around the capsule.<br> Are you ready to come in and hook on?<br> Roger. This is Hunt Club 1<br> ...waiting for your okay<br> to come in and hook on.<br> Roger. I've unplugged my suit,<br> so I'm kind of warm now.<br> Hunt Club 1. Roger.<br> One, Roger.<br> Roger. Blow the hatch after we hook on.<br> All right, get ready.<br> Another 15 feet to the right.<br> If you're ready for me<br> to blow the hatch...<br> ...I'll take my helmet off.<br> Say again, Liberty Bell.<br> Waiting for your okay to hook on.<br> Who designed this?<br> Say again, Liberty Bell. We can't hear you.<br> I can't get it off.<br> Liberty Bell, say again.<br> Waiting for your okay.<br> What happened?<br> It's all right. He's okay.<br> Go for the capsule.<br> Help, I'm sinking!<br> He can float in that suit.<br> We need the data in the capsule.<br> Throw down a line!<br> Help! Throw down the line!<br> Hey, I'm sinking!<br> Forget the fucking capsule!<br> We can't pull it. It's full of water.<br> Hey! Help me over here!<br> We've lost it.<br> Blow the cable.<br> Come back here!<br> Throw a line down.<br> I didn't do anything.<br> I was just lying there.<br> It just blew.<br> The hatch just blew.<br> It must have been a technical malfunction.<br> The capsule was rocking around a bit.<br> There were no loose items. I don't<br> see how I could have hit the button.<br> I was just lying there,<br> flat on my back, and it just blew.<br> Thank you, Mr. Grissom.<br> Well, what do you think?<br> Explosive hatches have been<br> on jet fighters for 10 years.<br> The things have been<br> wrung inside out...<br> ...subjected to trial by heat,<br> by water, by shaking, pounding.<br> We even drop them from a height<br> of 100 feet onto concrete...<br> ...and not one of them<br> has ever "just blown."<br> Are we going to the White House?<br> Isn't the president coming?<br> - Gus.<br> - Uh...<br> No ticker-tape parade in New York?<br> Uh-uh.<br> Not even one in Mitchell, Indiana?<br> Nope.<br> - No Jackie?<br> - Mm-mm.<br> By order of the president<br> of the United States...<br> ...the Distinguished Service Medal...<br> ...is awarded to<br> Captain Virgil I. Grissom...<br> ...who distinguished himself by valor<br> above and beyond the call of duty.<br> These actions reflect great<br> credit upon himself...<br> ...the Air Force...<br> ...and the United States of America.<br> Yo, Gus!<br> Attaboy, Gus.<br> You proud, boys?<br> Hey, look.<br> They filled up the refrigerator.<br> Pretty good, huh?<br> Pretty good. A full refrigerator!<br> I can see this afternoon<br> shaping up just great.<br> And the rest of the day. Tomorrow too.<br> What do they want me to do in here?<br> Cook?<br> Then risk my life and my kids'...<br> ...by crossing that highway<br> to the worst beach in Florida.<br> Oh, Gus, I wanted to eat<br> in the White House.<br> I wanted to talk to Jackie about...<br> ...things.<br> Well, look, I've got to go<br> to the Holiday Inn for some...<br> ...beer call with the guys.<br> No!<br> All those years of test flying...<br> ...and all those times I waited<br> and all those times you weren't there.<br> The military promised...<br> ...and now they are welshing<br> on that damn compact.<br> Look, I am finally<br> Mrs. Honorable Astronaut.<br> But they are treating me like I'm...<br> ...Honorable Mrs. Squirming<br> Hatch Blower.<br> I didn't do anything wrong!<br> The hatch just blew! It was a glitch!<br> It was a technical malfunction!<br> Why in hell won't anyone believe me?<br> I know that.<br> Oh.<br> Gus, I mean are these the goodies?<br> Is this how the military pays off? Huh?<br> Oh, Gus, they owe you.<br> But they owe me too.<br> They owe me.<br> They owe me. They owe me so much.<br> Oh, no.<br> I love you.<br> We are here with Virgil I. Grissom<br> and his lovely wife Betty.<br> Uh, Gus has just come back<br> from outer space.<br> How do you feel about this trip?<br> I'm so proud of him.<br> I think he was wonderful.<br> Uh, we're all proud of Gus Grissom.<br> Gus, do you feel the trip<br> was a success?<br> It was A-okay.<br> My God. He lost his capsule<br> but he's keeping his story.<br> To recap yesterday's events...<br> ...here we see America's<br> newest hero, Gus Grissom.<br> He is shouting to save<br> the capsule first.<br> To pull all that in flight test,<br> it's all over for him.<br> He screwed the pooch.<br> Plain and simple.<br> Sometimes you get a pooch<br> that can't be screwed.<br> The president's got his own problems<br> with the Bay of Pigs.<br> He doesn't want the Astronauts' image<br> tarnished.<br> Nothing these guys do is going<br> to be called failure.<br> These Astronauts are our Davids.<br> The public knows they're just<br> doing what monkeys have done.<br> Monkeys?<br> You think a monkey knows he's sitting<br> on a rocket that might explode?<br> These astronauts know that.<br> I'll tell you something.<br> It takes a special man to volunteer<br> for a suicide mission.<br> Especially when it's on TV.<br> Old Gus, he did all right.<br> ANNOUNCER".<br> Though the capsule was lost...<br> ...our new hero,<br> Astronaut Gus Grissom, was saved.<br> Now President Kennedy has started<br> an even more ambitious space program.<br> KENNEDY".<br> Those who came before us...<br> ...made certain this country...<br> ...rode the first waves<br> of the Industrial Revolution...<br> ...the first waves of modern invention,<br> and the first wave of nuclear power.<br> And this generation does not intend...<br> ...to founder in the backwash...<br> ...of the coming age of space.<br> We mean to be a part of it.<br> We mean to lead it.<br> You know, I always hated ying.<br> When I met you, you were already<br> a pilot, so I never had a complaint.<br> When you went up in those<br> planes, me and the kids...<br> We never had any insurance<br> except a couple months' pay.<br> I always hated all that<br> talk about insurance.<br> The government spends all<br> kinds of time and money...<br> ...teaching pilots how to be fearless.<br> But they don't spend a penny<br> teaching you how to be...<br> ...the fearless wife of a test pilot.<br> But I guess I liked it.<br> I guess I liked the kind<br> of man who could...<br> ...push the outside of the envelope.<br> Flyboy.<br> But I never could stand a man who<br> was one of those, um, "remember-whens."<br> Those bitter guys that just sit around<br> thinking about old times.<br> If I ever see that happen...<br> ...I'm going right out the front door.<br> And you'll never catch me.<br> I'm a fearless man,<br> but I'm scared to death of you.<br> No, you're not.<br> But you ought to be.<br> What is it?<br> The Russians have sent Titov up.<br> Titov's up.<br> - How long?<br> - A day.<br> A day? A whole day?<br> HEAD".<br> He's orbiting over our country right now.<br> We need a man in orbit<br> or it's all over.<br> We're scrapping the Redstone<br> and going with the Atlas.<br> You know we haven't had<br> too much luck with that rocket.<br> We can't take<br> all the precautions we'd like.<br> - It'll be dangerous.<br> - We're ready.<br> I said it'll be dangerous.<br> I said we're ready. One hundred percent.<br> Thank you, John.<br> Inside this trim, modest<br> suburban home is Annie Glenn...<br> ...wife of astronaut John Glenn...<br> ...sharing the anxiety and pride<br> of the world at this tense moment...<br> ...but in a private and crucial way<br> that only she can understand.<br> The vice president<br> would like to see Mrs. Glenn.<br> He's asking for you again.<br> Tell them no.<br> I'm sorry, she says no.<br> This is very important.<br> The vice president must see her.<br> No.<br> After the mission's success...<br> ...the vice president...<br> ...will speak with Annie Glenn.<br> Meanwhile, John Glenn<br> waits for the weather to clear...<br> ...so he can undertake<br> this historic mission.<br> You know what the Russians want?<br> No, sir.<br> They want our peckers in their pockets.<br> - She still says no.<br> - No?<br> Didn't you tell her<br> I'll bring in ABC-TV...<br> ...NBC-TV, CBS-TV?<br> Her words, and mine,<br> will be heard by millions.<br> Where are they going?<br> The flight's been canceled.<br> Canceled?<br> That's perfect.<br> I will go in and console<br> her on nationwide TV.<br> I'll pay her a sympathy call.<br> Yes, sir.<br> The vice president would like to<br> make a sympathy call if he could.<br> - No.<br> - No.<br> - No? What do you mean no?<br> - I mean no.<br> What do you mean no?<br> Get NASA on the line.<br> I'm going to lean on NASA.<br> I'm going right to the top.<br> - Right away.<br> - To the top.<br> Damn right.<br> They better tell her to play ball.<br> Hey, guys.<br> There's a problem with your wife.<br> - Is it serious?<br> - We think it is.<br> There's a phone hook-up,<br> we've got her on.<br> Annie?<br> It's me. Are you all right? What's wrong?<br> Johnson...<br> ...wants me...<br> ...on TV.<br> The vice president?<br> Tell her to let him in with the networks.<br> It's coverage.<br> It's important, John. It means a lot.<br> Annie.<br> Listen to me.<br> Are you listening?<br> If you don't want the vice president...<br> ...or the networks, or anyone else<br> in our house, that's it.<br> As far as I'm concerned,<br> they are not coming in.<br> And I will back you up 100 percent,<br> and you tell them that. Okay?<br> I don't want Johnson or the others<br> to even put a toe in our house.<br> Okay.<br> You tell them that astronaut<br> John Glenn told you to say that.<br> - All right?<br> - Yes.<br> I'll talk to you soon.<br> You can't do that.<br> The vice president's<br> head of the program!<br> You must think of the program!<br> You are out of line!<br> - I'm out of line?<br> - Yes, sir!<br> I run the show here.<br> - We'll see about that!<br> - Yeah?<br> And I'm thinking of changing<br> the order of flight assignments!<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Yeah!<br> - Who will you get?<br> - Who am I gonna get?<br> You heard what he said.<br> Take it easy, fellows.<br> Step aside.<br> Pilots.<br> Pansies! Cows!<br> Gladiolas!<br> Isn't there anybody who can<br> deal with a housewife?<br> Oh, you'll come a-waltzing,<br> Matilda, with me<br> And he sang as he watched<br> And waited till his billy boil<br> I thought Hank Williams<br> wrote "Waltzing Matilda. "<br> We don't know who wrote it.<br> - It's Australian, right?<br> - Yep.<br> - Good day, mate.<br> - Hi.<br> Who are you guys?<br> We're Aborigines.<br> Aborigines, eh?<br> Hi.<br> Who are you?<br> Me? I'm an astronaut.<br> - Astronaut.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, what do you do here, astronaut?<br> I'm here because a buddy<br> of mine is getting ready to...<br> ...fly overhead. Up in outer space.<br> And I'll be talking to him<br> on that dish.<br> - Fly over?<br> - Yeah.<br> You blokes do that too?<br> Heh. You do that yourself?<br> Not me, mate.<br> See that old bloke there?<br> He know.<br> He know the moon.<br> He know the star.<br> And he know the Milky Way.<br> He'll give you a hand.<br> He know.<br> We're gonna need all the help we can get.<br> Stand by for final ten-second count.<br> The clock is operating.<br> We're under way.<br> Good Lord,<br> ride all the way. God speed, John Glenn.<br> Zero G, and I feel fine.<br> The capsule is turning around.<br> Oh!<br> The view is tremendous.<br> I can see clear back,<br> a big cloud pattern, towards the Cape.<br> It's a beautiful sight!<br> Roger, Friendship 7.<br> You have a go, at least seven orbits.<br> Roger, Al. Understand,<br> go at least seven orbits.<br> Speed is 17,500 miles per hour...<br> ...and we're moving into night.<br> Full moon rising.<br> I can almost touch it.<br> Friendship 7, come in. Do you read?<br> Hello, Friendship 7?<br> Friendship 7, come in please.<br> This sure was a short day.<br> Say again, please.<br> That was the shortest day<br> I've run into.<br> Kind of passes rapidly, huh?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I can see lights...<br> ...down there in Australia.<br> Where are they from?<br> All of Perth and Rockingham<br> have turned their lights on for you.<br> And a few other lights...<br> ...are turned on too.<br> They show up very well. Thank everybody...<br> ...for turning them on, will you?<br> We sure will, John. We sure will.<br> Heading towards daybreak.<br> Lot of cloud coverage today.<br> It's beautiful.<br> Possibly it's the heat shield.<br> It's loose.<br> If it comes off...<br> He'll burn up.<br> He'll fry if he tries to re-enter.<br> Muchea, this is Cape.<br> We're showing some trouble.<br> We've got a warning light.<br> Possibly a loose heat shield.<br> Check your status lights.<br> He's coming.<br> John, can you hear me?<br> Friendship 7, come in, please.<br> Try something. Anything.<br> Friendship 7, come in.<br> This is Friendship 7. Do you read me?<br> Wait a second.<br> I see something strange out here.<br> Oh, my goodness,<br> what the heck is that?<br> Sparks and needles of some kind<br> all over the sky.<br> Hey, let me tell you<br> what I'm in up here.<br> I'm in a mass of very<br> small particles...<br> ...that are brilliantly lit up.<br> They're luminescent.<br> I never saw anything like it.<br> A shower of them coming by now.<br> They're bright yellow.<br> They swirl around the capsule...<br> ...and they're brilliantly lighted.<br> Do you think they could be alive?<br> It sounds ridiculous,<br> but they look like fireflies.<br> Heh, heh. Whoa.<br> Whoa. Maybe some Air Force<br> experiment went amuck.<br> Could our astronomers<br> have been wrong?<br> Hello, Cap Com, do you read me?<br> This is miraculous.<br> Could it be those fireflies,<br> or whatever they are?<br> Of course not. Fireflies?<br> Hello, Cap Com?<br> Roger, Friendship 7.<br> Will you correlate<br> the actions of the particles...<br> ...with that of your control jets?<br> Uh, negative.<br> I do not think they were<br> coming from my control jets.<br> Listen, I'm gonna try to get<br> some pictures of these little guys.<br> Sounds like a good idea.<br> You guys probably think I'm nuts.<br> They're very beautiful.<br> Like fireies on a summer night.<br> They just dance around. Ha-ha-ha.<br> Get out of here.<br> Get out of here, you gadgets.<br> Heading into daybreak now.<br> Another day.<br> Leaving the fireflies behind.<br> I have no idea what they were.<br> This is Friendship 7. Do you read me?<br> That was some night.<br> That was really exciting.<br> He's going into his third orbit.<br> How much longer are you going<br> to keep him in the dark?<br> What do we tell him?<br> He's a pilot.<br> Tell him the condition of his craft.<br> Glenn is in his third orbit...<br> ...and the flight is going<br> pretty much as planned.<br> No human individual...<br> ...has ever been so well-prepared.<br> So far the key word on this<br> textbook ight is "operational."<br> Everything is A-okay.<br> We haven't been lucky<br> with the Atlas rocket.<br> Some say we haven't taken all<br> the safety precautions we'd like to.<br> Is this true?<br> No, it's absolutely not true.<br> The only critical point<br> is the re-entry.<br> If the capsule is not<br> at the correct angle...<br> ...with the blunt end and heat<br> shield down, it will burn up.<br> There is only one hope.<br> Leave the retro-rocket package,<br> which covers the heat shield, on.<br> The straps may be strong enough<br> to hold the heat shield in place.<br> But if this fails...<br> John, you're going to<br> y-by-wire for re-entry.<br> We recommend you do the best<br> you can to keep a zero angle. Over.<br> Re-entry only three orbits?<br> That is correct.<br> Do you have a reason for this?<br> Uh, not at this time.<br> This is the judgment of Cape Flight.<br> Roger.<br> Uh, do you have a time for<br> going to jettison retro? Over.<br> We are not sure<br> your landing bag is deployed.<br> We feel it is possible to re-enter<br> with the retro-package on.<br> We see no difficulty<br> with that type of re-entry.<br> Do you read?<br> Roger.<br> Understand.<br> HI line up as carefully<br> as I can in a minute.<br> See if scanners will pick it up<br> and correct retro-fire attitude.<br> Uh, if not, I'll correct it myself. Over.<br> Roger, Friendship 7.<br> We're lined up.<br> Here we go.<br> What's that sound?<br> Humming. It's him.<br> It's all right. He does that.<br> - John?<br> - He can't hear you.<br> He's in the ionization blackout.<br> No communications are possible<br> for a few minutes.<br> Then we'll know.<br> Friendship 7, this is Cape.<br> Do you read?<br> This is Cape. Do you read?<br> Friendship 7, this is Cape.<br> Do you read?<br> Automatic systems<br> are not functioning.

Well, no sweat. Let's go.<br> I'm ready when you are, John, 100 percent.<br> Okay.<br> T minus 10, nine...<br> ...eight, seven, six, five...<br> ...four, three, two, one.<br> Go.<br> Go, Hot Dog, go!<br> Up we go into the wild blue yonder."<br> Thirty seconds and fuel<br> is go, oxygen is go...<br> ...cabin pressure on the top peg.<br> Altimeter is working.<br> Have a good ride, buddy. Go.<br> The sun is coming through the window.<br> Oh, Lord, what a heavenly light.<br> The Mercury program was over.<br> Four years later...<br> ...Gus Grissom was killed<br> along with astronauts White and Chaffee...<br> ...when fire swept through<br> their Apollo capsule.<br> But on that glorious day<br> in May, 1963...<br> ...Gordo Cooper went higher,<br> farther, and faster...<br> ...than any other American. Twenty-two<br> complete orbits around the world.<br> He was the last American<br> ever to go into space alone.<br> And for a brief moment...<br> ...Gordo Cooper became the greatest<br> pilot anyone had ever seen.<br>
