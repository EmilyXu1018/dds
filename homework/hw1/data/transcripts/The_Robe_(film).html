                        Rome, master of the earth,<br> in the 18th year of the emperor tiberius.<br> Our legions stand guard<br> on the boundaries of civilization<br> from the foggy coasts of the northern seas<br> to the ancient rivers of babylon,<br> the finest fighting machines in history.<br> The people of 30 lands send us tribute:<br> Their gold and silk, ivory and frankincense,<br> and their proudest sons to be our slaves.<br> We have reached the point where there<br> are more slaves in rome than citizens.<br> Some say we are only looters<br> of what others have created,<br> that we create nothing ourselves.<br> But we have made gods,<br> fine gods and goddesses,<br> who make love<br> and war.<br> Huntresses<br> and drunkards.<br> But the power lies not in their hands<br> of marble, but in ours of flesh.<br> We, the nobles of rome, are free<br> to live only for our own pleasure.<br> Could any god offer us more?<br> Today we traffic in human souls.<br> The slave market is crowded because the<br> emperor's heir and regent, young caligula,<br> is coming to buy gladiators.<br> He probably will not be pleased to see me.<br> Look here, look here. A singer, a dancer,<br> a companion for a noble lady,<br> or a noble gentleman.<br> Stop, gentlemen.<br> A priceless gem for your household.<br> Look here, look here. A singer, a dancer,<br> a companion for a noble lady<br> or a noble gentleman.<br> A physician from egypt.<br> Question him if you like.<br> Stop and look. Stop and look.<br> Ajewel, ajewel from the east.<br> You've heard of the beauty<br> of the circassians. Look.<br> A beauty from circassia. Stop and look.<br> Buy young and train them yourself.<br> Children grow into men and women.<br> These goths grow strong.<br> Buy young. Buy young<br> and train them yourself.<br> Too old? Why, he's still got<br> ten or fifteen years left in him.<br> He costs no more than an ox,<br> and cheaper to feed.<br> A pair to touch the heart of any buyer.<br> A mother and child from syria.<br> Buy them together. Buy them separately.<br> Smile. What's the matter with you?<br> Tribune. You came. I have them. Wait.<br> Girls. Girls.<br> Look. Two identical rubies. They're perfect.<br> And this one is a hairdresser.<br> She's an expert. Look at her hands.<br> - Very nice. Aren't they nice, livia?<br> - Let go of me.<br> - I apologize for last night...<br> - anything you say will be a lie.<br> Slave loose! Slave loose!<br> Thank you, tribune.<br> A tribune. So today in rome a tribune<br> does the vile work of a slave master.<br> Fool. Will you never learn? This is<br> senator gallio's son you're speaking to.<br> - Down on your...<br> - what's this? Tried it again?<br> Give me his slate. "highborn, educated,<br> qualified for household steward."<br> Sell him for lion bait. Put him up<br> as a gladiator. Never mind the price.<br> But, cleander, caligula's<br> buying gladiators today.<br> - What of it?<br> - He'll get this greek for nothing.<br> - He's worth 1,000 pieces of gold.<br> - He's worth his weight in dog's meat.<br> - Please.<br> - A gladiator. You heard me.<br> You animal. Animal!<br> Did you hear what he said? Lion bait.<br> - I'm sorry. What were you saying?<br> - There's nothing more to say.<br> After last night you'll never hear<br> another word out of me.<br> In front of my friends, too. I know you<br> were drunk as a pig, but that's no excuse.<br> Do you realize you've made me<br> the laughing stock of rome, marcellus?<br> Marcellus gallio.<br> Don't think i won't talk about this.<br> - I intend to.<br> - Yes.<br> It's good to see you, marcellus.<br> It's good to see you again.<br> Then you do remember me.<br> Yes, of course. Let me see now, it was the...<br> and your promise.<br> Have you forgotten that too?<br> What promise?<br> To marry me.<br> Was i drunk?<br> That's not very flattering, marcellus.<br> If you'd tell me when i was supposed<br> to have said this - the circumstances.<br> I remember them perfectly.<br> I'd cut my finger, and i cried.<br> You took a dagger and cut your own finger<br> to show me that it didn't really hurt.<br> Then you kissed me and i stopped crying,<br> and then you promised<br> to marry me when we grew up.<br> Diana.<br> - Where have your freckles gone?<br> - I lost them.<br> - I loved every one of them.<br> - Then i'm sorry i lost them.<br> Let me look at you.<br> to make you blossom so.<br> - What are you doing in rome?<br> - Tiberius sent me.<br> Since my father died<br> i've been the ward of the emperor.<br> - Yes, this is caligula's pavilion.<br> - Empress julia thinks i'd be good for him.<br> Caligula? You can't.<br> He'll be emperor someday, and...<br> would that matter, marcellus, to you?<br> More than my life. After all, i promised you.<br> And you'll never know<br> how seriously i took your promise.<br> Do you intend to hold me to it, diana?<br> I might. But i've heard<br> that you've made other promises since.<br> But only one vow to diana.<br> He's coming, marcellus. You'd better go.<br> Caligula and i have been in competition<br> before, and i've never lost to him.<br> - At least you're frank, marcellus.<br> - I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.<br> Then all the tales i've heard of you are true.<br> - Every man makes enemies.<br> - All your enemies seem to be women.<br> Yes.<br> Begin the sale.<br> And why is tribune gallio in my pavilion?<br> Does he seek a favor?<br> I invited him, sire. We were friends<br> many years ago when we were children.<br> Buying today, or looking for amusement?<br> Buying, i hope, sire. A pair of twins.<br> - Male or female?<br> - Female.<br> - Have them put up first.<br> - Sire.<br> No. Sit down, here with me.<br> You're very kind, sire.<br> The pleasure of our loyal tribune<br> is important to us.<br> You have such excellent taste.<br> These twins must be charming.<br> We have here two macedonian twins,<br> trained as companions, entertainers,<br> servant for a highborn lady.<br> Only once a year can their like<br> be found on the auction blocks of rome.<br> They won't be sold separately.<br> What am i bid?<br> - Don't lose them, gallio.<br> - 1500.<br> - Marcellus, are you my friend or aren't you?<br> - Not to this extent.<br> - 2,000.<br> - The bid stands at 2,000 pieces of gold.<br> - You bid for yourself?<br> - No.<br> Sold for 2500.<br> Forgive me, gallio, but i have<br> decided to give them to the lady diana.<br> - But, sire...<br> - you wouldn't refuse me?<br> No, sire.<br> Offered as a gladiator, a greek.<br> I guarantee his strength and fighting spirit.<br> - Buy him.<br> - 50 gold pieces.<br> - 50.<br> - Dog's meat!<br> There are no more bids. Get on with the sale.<br> - You bid against me?<br> - Against tribune quintus.<br> - Be careful, tribune.<br> - The greek is well-qualified, sire.<br> - He's worth a better price.<br> - 200 gold pieces.<br> - 300.<br> - You want to make a gift of him to me?<br> No, sire. I want him.<br> And i bid against quintus.<br> - 500.<br> - 700.<br> - 800.<br> - 900.<br> The bid is 3,000 pieces of gold.<br> A little high, but i expected<br> to spend more on the twins.<br> You offend me, tribune.<br> I think it's time you offend me no more.<br> Detail! March!<br> Sold to tribune gallio.<br> A wonderful purchase, sir,<br> even though you may have to beat him.<br> - Yes. Unchain him.<br> - Sir?<br> - Unchain him.<br> - But he's a dangerous man.<br> - Unchain him.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What's your name?<br> Demetrius, from corinth.<br> At the end of the street you'll find<br> the house of my father, senator gallio.<br> It has a scarlet door.<br> Report to the steward there.<br> There are times<br> when i'm away with senator gallio.<br> In that case, the slave attending<br> the front door is required to light the lamps.<br> To be a slave in this household<br> is an honor.<br> To be a slave anywhere is to be a dog.<br> The door. Open it. Remember to bow.<br> The door. Run, you fool.<br> - Good evening, marcipor.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> It's you.<br> No household duties.<br> He'll be my personal attendant.<br> You could have run away. Why didn't you?<br> I owe you a debt, sir. I pay my debts.<br> - Not a slave's reason. More like a roman's.<br> - A greek's.<br> Yes, i know. In the great days of greece,<br> we romans were no more than barbarians.<br> Have marcipor show you where i keep<br> my clothes. I'll change before dinner.<br> Good evening, mother. Lucia.<br> Sorry, mother, i was outbid for those twins.<br> - We know, marcellus.<br> - Diana was here.<br> Diana? You should have<br> kept her till i got home.<br> Marcellus. She told us that<br> you and caligula had a quarrel...<br> - don't worry about that.<br> - Caligula's very angry.<br> - She takes him too seriously.<br> - She has to.<br> - She's going to marry him.<br> - Did she tell you that?<br> Mother, look. I think<br> he's in love with her himself.<br> Love's like wine. A sip hurts nobody, but<br> to empty the bottle is to invite a headache.<br> Well, you won't even get a taste.<br> She thinks you're very funny.<br> - She does?<br> - She thought you wanted the twins.<br> - Lucia.<br> - That's what she said, mother.<br> Marcellus. Are you deliberately trying<br> to cut the ground from under my feet,<br> orjust too much of a fool<br> to understand what you've done?<br> You mean my difference<br> of opinion with caligula?<br> I lead the senators who oppose him, and my<br> son makes fun of him at private banquets,<br> and now humiliates him in public.<br> I'm fighting for the republic<br> against the tyranny of the emperors.<br> - I know that.<br> - You know nothing.<br> Nothing but dice and women.<br> And now, by your behavior<br> to caligula, by these petty slights,<br> you cripple me, make my fight<br> look like a personal quarrel.<br> - Yes?<br> - Sir, tribune quintus is at the door.<br> - For me?<br> - For your son.<br> - I'm not at home.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Your leave. Give this to tribune gallio<br> when he does come home.<br> Well, aren't you going to read it?<br> After dinner.<br> Good eating to you.<br> Ladies. Senator gallio.<br> Quintus is a very important man.<br> He was already my enemy.<br> - May we know?<br> - It's from caligula.<br> "The courage of a military tribune must not<br> be squandered in baths and banquet halls."<br> "You are ordered<br> to the garrison at jerusalem."<br> - Jerusalem.<br> - "You sail tonight on the palestine galley."<br> That's all. Not even<br> an expression of his tender regard.<br> Cornelia, he will need his things.<br> Help your mother, lucia.<br> Where's jerusalem?<br> Palestine.<br> The worst pest-hole in the empire.<br> A stiff-necked, riotous people<br> always on the verge of rebellion.<br> Our legions there are the scum of the army,<br> the officers little better than the men.<br> Disease takes them off like flies.<br> Some have been assassinated,<br> sometimes by their own men.<br> Others have spared the assassins the trouble.<br> What caligula hopes he has given you<br> is your death sentence.<br> - "We who are about to die"?<br> - Marcellus.<br> Marcellus, you are<br> the only son i'll ever have.<br> You know what my ambitions<br> have been for you.<br> I know how i've disappointed you.<br> Try to endure it, marcellus.<br> Grow hard.<br> Watch the hand of the man<br> who walks behind you.<br> Drink in private and sleep<br> with your sword at your side.<br> Take nothing on faith.<br> Bind yourself to no man.<br> Above all, be a roman, my son,<br> and be a man of honor.<br> Perhaps there'll be amusement<br> in being a man of honor.<br> - Ready, sir?<br> - Yes, that's the last of my gear.<br> Ready at the oars.<br> Man the lines.<br> Careful with that, it's the wine.<br> Yes, sir.<br> There's no need to be so formal, demetrius.<br> We'll both need friends where we're going.<br> Friends can't be bought, sir,<br> even for 3,000 pieces of gold.<br> Is there anything else you want, sir?<br> No.<br> The lady diana begs a word with you, sir,<br> before you leave.<br> We don't want to lose this tide, sir.<br> Diana.<br> I came to tell you that i'm going back to capri<br> to ask the emperor to intercede for you.<br> Why?<br> I think caligula treated you unjustly.<br> Why, diana?<br> It was partly my fault what happened.<br> The real reason.<br> Because i've found you again,<br> and i don't want to lose you.<br> Perhaps you don't believe that<br> a girl of 11 could fall in love<br> and stay in love all these years.<br> Tribune.<br> Don't cry, my love.<br> Lucia thought i was in love.<br> I laughed at her,<br> but women are wise in these matters.<br> Tribune. We'll miss the tide.<br> Make tiberius promise<br> not to give you to caligula<br> until i come back.<br> Cast off.<br> - Pull up.<br> - Lines are up.<br> Start the oars.<br> Jerusalem's no pleasure resort at its best.<br> This is the worst,<br> the feast they call the passover.<br> This is when their soothsayers<br> tell them the messiah will come.<br> - Messiah? What's that?<br> - King. Savior. Redeemer.<br> Son of their god - and general troublemaker.<br> - He's coming here?<br> - No one knows.<br> No one knows if he even exists.<br> He is, but he isn't.<br> He hasn't come yet, but he's coming.<br> Every year the same.<br> You'll find out, tribune,<br> if you live long enough.<br> Thanks for the kind wish, centurion.<br> The messiah.<br> There he is.<br> What stirred them up?<br> Perhaps he's coming after all, the messiah.<br> Something's happening, that's certain.<br> Look. There. Those people carrying palms.<br> The man riding a white donkey. See him?<br> Flavius, clear us a path through these cattle.<br> Demetrius, come along.<br> Your master will have you flogged.<br> - Did you see him?<br> - Who?<br> - The man who just rode past.<br> - I was over there.<br> He stopped here and looked at me.<br> He looked into my eyes.<br> - What did he want?<br> - I don't know.<br> I thought he was going to speak<br> but he didn't.<br> Only his eyes spoke.<br> Come on, demetrius.<br> I think he wants me to follow him.<br> - Who is he? A general?<br> - No.<br> - A king?<br> - No, he's not a king.<br> He's...<br> i don't know.<br> This is for the tribune. It's very important.<br> Excuse me. Let me pass, please.<br> Here you are, tribune, just as i promised you.<br> The finest syrian wine<br> from the vintage you like the best.<br> And now, tribune, there's<br> a little matter of payment.<br> One, two, three, four<br> skins of wine you owe me for.<br> Four skins of wine for four days, remember?<br> Who are you?<br> Who am i?<br> The tribune has a sense of humor.<br> - He asks me who i am.<br> - Ever seen this man before?<br> - No, never.<br> - Never, sire.<br> Gentlemen, please. Please. I am caleb,<br> caleb the wine merchant. Remember?<br> I'm an honest man.<br> The tribune and i have an agreement.<br> A skin of wine every day.<br> Don't you remember?<br> Please, gentlemen.<br> I want my money. I'm a poor man.<br> You're not poor. You're as rich as midas.<br> And you're not honest. You're a thief.<br> - Then you do recognize me.<br> - As for being a wine merchant...<br> the stuff you sell isn't fit for ajackass.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Tribune, what have you done?<br> Enjoying yourself?<br> Whoever conquered this land<br> should have been strung up.<br> - Demetrius, pour us some of this poison.<br> - The curse of empire.<br> But think how we make it possible<br> for those in rome to enjoy themselves.<br> I am thinking about it.<br> Pilate's given orders to arrest that fanatic.<br> Remember? The day you arrived?<br> Yes, the messiah. What did he do?<br> He's been preaching,<br> stirring up a commotion.<br> - Why don't you arrest him?<br> - It's not easy.<br> Pilate wants it done quietly.<br> The man's got half the people on his side.<br> We've got to find out where he is at night.<br> And that is like finding<br> one particular ant in an ant hill.<br> Vinegar, like the rest of it. I hope you drown.<br> I don't care how you handle it, centurion.<br> Just do your duty.<br> There's one way that never fails.<br> But it'll cost you some money.<br> Demetrius, how much is left in the purse?<br> - Eight gold pieces and some silver, sir.<br> - That should be enough.<br> Give him the purse.<br> Give him the purse.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> I'll report later. Tribune.<br> Pour me some of that wine.<br> Demetrius?<br> Demetrius.<br> Friend. Friend, could you help me?<br> I'm looking for the carpenter<br> from galilee, the one called jesus.<br> - What do you want with him?<br> - I must warn him. I'm a slave like you are.<br> You're not even clever, you roman spy.<br> Wait.<br> You. Stop.<br> - I'm looking for the man called jesus.<br> - Who?<br> - The one they say is the messiah.<br> - I never heard of him.<br> Can you help me? I'm looking for a man.<br> - A man? What's his name?<br> - Jesus. I must warn him.<br> You're too late.<br> Even now he is before pilate.<br> - They found him?<br> - He was betrayed to them,<br> and by one he loved and trusted.<br> By his disciple, who sat at his left hand.<br> Why?<br> Because men are weak.<br> Because they are cursed<br> with envy and cowardice.<br> Because they can dream of truth,<br> but cannot live with it, they doubt.<br> They doubt, the fools.<br> Why must men betray<br> themselves with doubts?<br> Tell them, the others. Find them<br> and tell them not to doubt.<br> Even now, not to doubt.<br> Tell them to keep their faith.<br> They must keep faith.<br> Wait. Tell who?<br> - Who are you?<br> - My name is judas.<br> Tribune, wake up.<br> Come on. Do i have to drag you?<br> Duty calls, if the word<br> means anything to you.<br> - What is it?<br> - The governor wants you.<br> - At this hour?<br> - Come. Pilate doesn't like to be kept waiting.<br> Sir, i need your help.<br> Where's my helmet?<br> - I spoke to you of the man jesus.<br> - Yes, the fanatic.<br> - He's been arrested, sir.<br> - What do you expect me to do about it?<br> Intercede for him.<br> Make them see that he's innocent.<br> No. When his trial comes up, i'll look into it.<br> What's he supposed to have done?<br> He's already been tried.<br> He's been condemned by pilate himself.<br> - Pilate?<br> - You're going there, sir.<br> If he stains his hands with this blood,<br> he's a murderer.<br> That's enough. Pilate's the governor,<br> the roman governor.<br> As far as i'm concerned,<br> that ends the matter.<br> - As far as you're concerned, too.<br> - Ready?<br> Yes.<br> For your own good,<br> you'd better forget you ever saw this man.<br> - I don't like to be kept waiting, tribune.<br> - I'm sorry, sir. I came as soon as i could.<br> I have special orders for you.<br> You're to report to the emperor at capri.<br> You must have powerful friends at court.<br> - I suppose i have, sir.<br> - There'll be a galley at the end of the week.<br> I have one task before you leave. It's routine.<br> An execution. Today.<br> - Three criminals.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> One of them's a fanatic. He has a following.<br> There may be some trouble,<br> some attempt to interfere.<br> - Take enough men.<br> - I understand, sir.<br> I've had a miserable night. Factions,<br> no one agreeing with anyone else.<br> Even my wife had an opinion.<br> Good luck. I'm sorry to lose you.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Give me water to wash my hands.<br> - But you just washed them, my lord.<br> - Did i?<br> So i did.<br> Some wine before you go, gentlemen?<br> - No.<br> - You'd better.<br> - Your first crucifixion, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> What? Never driven nails into a man's flesh?<br> Hail our king. Our king.<br> Make way.<br> - Is it night?<br> - No.<br> It's the middle of the day.<br> This isn't like other days.<br> Your go, paulus.<br> Four.<br> You're lucky today, tribune. I'm finished.<br> - I'm always lucky.<br> - You. Bring me that robe.<br> - I have a proposition for you, tribune.<br> - What?<br> You'll see.<br> - Hurry up.<br> - What's the matter with that slave?<br> - Where did you find him, tribune?<br> - Throw the dice again, paulus.<br> Mine by right of possession.<br> First-class homespun,<br> previously owned by a carpenter of galilee.<br> How much will you risk against it?<br> - 11.<br> - Tribune?<br> Lucky again.<br> Tribune gallio's first battle trophy,<br> for victory over the king of the jews.<br> We've done our duty, centurion.<br> No need to joke about it.<br> You can say that. You're going back<br> to capri to kiss the emperor's hand.<br> I have to stay here in this sinkhole.<br> - Get back to your post.<br> - Let me go.<br> - They say the storm's ajudgment.<br> - Superstitious idiot.<br> - They say he's the son of god.<br> - Maybe he is. I don't know.<br> Father, forgive them,<br> for they know not what they do.<br> Throw that cloth over me.<br> Didn't you hear me?<br> Throw that cloth over me.<br> Take it off.<br> Take it off.<br> Take it off.<br> You crucified him.<br> You, my master.<br> But you've freed me.<br> I'll never serve you again, you roman pig.<br> Masters of the world, you call yourselves.<br> Thieves. Murderers.<br> Jungle animals.<br> A curse on you.<br> A curse on your empire.<br> There it is again, sir.<br> No.<br> No. No.<br> Stop it. Stop it.<br> Stop it. Why don't you stop it?<br> - Stop what, sir?<br> - Were you out there?<br> Out where, sir?<br> I'm sorry.<br> A nightmare.<br> It must have been a nightmare.<br> - We should put him in irons, sir.<br> - He's a tribune.<br> I don't care. He's dangerous.<br> If he asks me once more "were you<br> out there?" in that tone of voice...<br> i haven't slept since we left joppa.<br> My lady.<br> My lady, he is here.<br> What's wrong, marcellus? You're ill.<br> - What is it? Let me help you.<br> - No one can help me.<br> It's enough that i'm with you again.<br> Let's sit here.<br> You can have no trouble so great<br> that i'd be afraid to share it.<br> Ever since i went away<br> you've been in my heart.<br> Your voice in my ears,<br> your image in my eyes.<br> Waking and sleeping, you were with me.<br> And even more, since it happened.<br> - Since what happened?<br> - Every evening of the voyage,<br> a star appeared above the bow,<br> standing bright and steady in the sky,<br> as if sent to guide the ship home.<br> In my illness,<br> i thought you had sent it as a sign.<br> It became my one link with sanity.<br> Sanity? What do you mean?<br> What is it, marcellus? Tell me.<br> - Marcellus?<br> - Don't come near me.<br> Keep away.<br> No, marcellus. Don't.<br> My love, my poor love.<br> Tell me.<br> Soon enough you'll learn the truth.<br> I am ill, as you guessed.<br> But in my mind.<br> The truth is, i'm mad.<br> My lady?<br> - What is it?<br> - A message from the emperor.<br> He'll see tribune gallio at once.<br> Yes.<br> - You can't go now, not till you've rested.<br> - It's no use. He already knows.<br> The captain of the galley ran to<br> report to him as soon as we docked.<br> I'll go with you.<br> I can't ask you to.<br> But i want you to know<br> you're free from your promise.<br> Sire, tribune gallio is here<br> as you commanded.<br> But he was made ill by the voyage.<br> I beg you to postpone the audience<br> until he is rested.<br> - Does he ask for a postponement?<br> - No, sire, but i do. I implore you.<br> It would serve no purpose.<br> I will see him now.<br> Bring him in.<br> The lovely lady diana married to an idiot.<br> But she's too good for caligula, isn't she?<br> After 40 years with julia,<br> my approaching death<br> holds few terrors for me.<br> Death, sire? But my last examination<br> proves you'll live for 20 years at least.<br> - My physician is very loyal.<br> - Not 20, sire.<br> in the entrails of an owl.<br> And my soothsayer even more loyal.<br> The entrails of an owl.<br> No, stay. We may have need<br> of you men of science.<br> The entrails of an owl.<br> - You are welcome, tribune.<br> - Thank you, sire.<br> I bring you dispatches from pontius pilate.<br> By your leave, sire, he asked me<br> to put them into your hands and no others.<br> Then they must hold bad news.<br> - Sit down, tribune.<br> - Thank you, sire.<br> Tell me, what was your impression of pilate?<br> - It's not my place to...<br> - i'm asking you.<br> Did you find him capable?<br> Yes, sire. He is considered<br> a good administrator.<br> - Stern, as befits a roman governor?<br> - I'm sure of that, sire.<br> Just?<br> I can't say.<br> Why not? Surely you can give me<br> some sort of an answer.<br> Tell me, tribune, what happened out there?<br> - What happened?<br> - Were you out there?<br> Marcellus.<br> I told you, sire, he's ill. Let me take...<br> leave him alone. Stand back.<br> Tribune gallio, you are a roman officer.<br> I command you to get control over yourself.<br> Yes, sire.<br> This report of pilate's,<br> and your own condition,<br> hint alike at a serious situation.<br> - Now speak.<br> - Please, marcellus. He wants to help you.<br> I'm not your enemy, boy.<br> I fought in lberia with your grandfather.<br> Your father was like a son to me.<br> Now tell me. Everything.<br> Is tribune gallio still there?<br> He's been talking for two hours, my lady.<br> - And?<br> - Hopeless, my lady. Completely hopeless.<br> The son of god?<br> What god?<br> I don't know, sire.<br> I don't know.<br> And you lost your wits<br> when he looked at you?<br> No.<br> It was later, when i put on the robe.<br> Miracles, disciples, slaves running away...<br> roman legionaries<br> fraternizing with the natives...<br> well, none of this<br> concerns us for the moment.<br> We must make you well.<br> What have you learned gentlemen to say?<br> A difficult matter, sire. Under my care...<br> - he'd never improve.<br> - Who gave you permission to speak?<br> The clue to this man's sanity<br> is not in a vial of medicine.<br> - Well, where then?<br> - In the robe that bewitched him.<br> - Go on.<br> - Plainly, there was a curse on the robe.<br> His only chance is to find it and destroy it.<br> An interesting notion.<br> He's right, sire. He must be right.<br> The robe was bewitched.<br> - Let me find it, sire, destroy it.<br> - If you do, your mind will be restored.<br> A lost robe in the hands of a runaway slave?<br> - What chance would you have?<br> - He couldn't get away.<br> He must be still in palestine, with<br> the other followers of the dead man.<br> He had disciples.<br> It's there in pilate's message.<br> Who knows what powers<br> he left to these disciples?<br> Magic formulas, potions...<br> - beware.<br> - He is dead, dodinius.<br> Evil never dies. It lives -<br> in the air, in the robe, everywhere.<br> Tribune gallio, i give you<br> an imperial commission.<br> For yourself, find this robe and destroy it.<br> For rome, seek out<br> the followers of this dead magician.<br> I want names, tribune.<br> Names of all the disciples, of every man<br> and woman who subscribe to this treason.<br> Names, tribune. All of them.<br> No matter how much it costs<br> or how long it takes.<br> You will report directly to me.<br> I understand, sire.<br> - I am grateful.<br> - A galley will be put at your disposal.<br> You will leave at once, on the first tide.<br> That is all.<br> Thank you, sire.<br> Wait.<br> For your sake, i interfered when<br> my wife wanted to give you to caligula.<br> For your sake, i brought your tribune<br> back from palestine.<br> For your sake, i now free you from him.<br> But, sire, i have no wish to be free.<br> Have you gone mad too?<br> He had everything then.<br> He could have had me too.<br> I wanted him,<br> but i wasn't sure that i loved him.<br> Now i am sure.<br> I think it my duty<br> to forbid you to see him again.<br> As a child, you were wise.<br> Now you reason like a woman, foolishly.<br> I can't help being a woman, sire,<br> but i try to reason as you taught me.<br> You were a soldier, sire.<br> When you won, you could expect<br> your legions to cheer you.<br> But when you lost,<br> what would you have given<br> to see the eagles raised in your honor,<br> to hear your name on every man's lips?<br> I like caligula no better than you do,<br> but what a wife<br> you would make for an emperor.<br> Very well, my dear.<br> Your tribune shall have another chance.<br> Thank you, sire.<br> When it comes,<br> this is how it will start.<br> Some obscure martyr<br> in some forgotten province.<br> Then madness, infecting the legions,<br> rotting the empire,<br> then the finish of rome.<br> But if the tribune breaks the spell...<br> spell, you fool? What spell?<br> This is more dangerous than any spell<br> your superstitious mind could dream of.<br> It is man's desire to be free.<br> It is the greatest madness of them all.<br> And i have sent the most effective<br> physician i could find to cure it.<br> I have sent a madman.<br> Tribune. Tribune.<br> - I warned you not to call me tribune.<br> - Worthy merchant, then. I have news for you.<br> When abidor says<br> he'll find someone, he finds him.<br> You found the greek slave. Where is he?<br> I haven't seen him, not myself.<br> But he is known, in this village.<br> - Cana, it's called. You'll find him soon.<br> - "Soon." with you it's always "soon."<br> We've been to three provinces and<br> a hundred villages. Has he been seen?<br> These villagers are suspicious.<br> In this land of galilee, the crucified one<br> has many friends, very many.<br> Names for your list, tribune -<br> merchant, i mean.<br> And coins for me too, no?<br> A coin for every name.<br> - The greek. What about the greek?<br> - He has been here.<br> He is somewhere in galilee now,<br> with one they call the big fisherman.<br> - Fisherman?<br> - That's all i know. You'll find out the rest.<br> The emperor's spy is cleverer<br> than a poor syrian guide.<br> I'll prepare the way for you. A roman<br> merchant comes to trade for their homespun.<br> Your gold will buy their answers.<br> And their lives.<br> Got any woolens? He'll buy them.<br> He wants all the homespun in galilee.<br> - Who is he?<br> - The roman merchant.<br> He's paying well over market prices.<br> Says homespun is coming into style in<br> rome. The fine ladies dye it fancy colors.<br> Maybe he'll buy this.<br> Look what he paid me,<br> and there was a moth hole in it.<br> I wouldn't have used that rag of mine<br> for a donkey blanket.<br> Look.<br> Wait.<br> You've paid more than you should have.<br> Is this how we were taught?<br> Do we pray to be washed of the sin of greed<br> only to close the book,<br> and cheat the stranger in our midst?<br> Well, i'm not ashamed, justus. This money<br> comes from the taxes that grind us down.<br> Does one crime erase another?<br> Friends, shall we turn dishonest<br> because life is hard?<br> I think you gave me too much.<br> Thank you, friend.<br> I hope you'll forgive my neighbors.<br> I wasn't angry. A man is not cheated<br> when he's satisfied with the price.<br> But you weren't the real loser.<br> They were only cheating themselves.<br> Good day.<br> Wait.<br> I'd like to camp overnight here.<br> Can you suggest a place?<br> I'd be glad to.<br> You seem to have great influence here.<br> Well, when age speaks,<br> youth listens, sometimes.<br> That's not what i mean.<br> - Are you their leader?<br> - I'm only a weaver.<br> Few travelers come to cana.<br> What's the news from the great world?<br> The world's the same. But i've heard<br> that some new ideas have sprung up.<br> Ideas are...<br> ideas are important. They grow like children.<br> - Have you any children?<br> - Several. And a grandchild.<br> We call him jonathan, because he was born<br> with a crooked foot, like jonathan of old.<br> Jonathan of old?<br> I don't suppose they teach<br> our history in roman schools.<br> - Jonathan.<br> - Yes?<br> Wait for me.<br> - Didn't you tell me he was crippled?<br> - He's well now.<br> Jonathan, this is...<br> caius marcellus. How are you, jonathan?<br> - I'm fine, thank you. Are these your<br> donkeys? - Yes.<br> Behind this house there's<br> a good place to camp, and a well.<br> Jonathan, come along.<br> It's time for you to eat.<br> - Already? It's early.<br> - Perhaps he would like a ride on a donkey.<br> - May i?<br> - Of course.<br> What's more, you can keep him.<br> From now on he's jonathan's donkey.<br> - Mine?<br> - You are very generous, sir.<br> No. I'm still in your debt.<br> Is he one of us, grandfather?<br> You are, or you wouldn't be giving things<br> away. Did jesus tell you to do that?<br> You must have known him.<br> He straightened my foot.<br> - There you are.<br> - Go. Go.<br> Fast, go. Grandfather, look, i'm riding.<br> I'm riding my own donkey.<br> Look, everybody. He's mine.<br> David, look. He's my donkey. Mine.<br> Look, everybody. The man<br> down there gave him to me.<br> Jesus used to live near here,<br> you know. In nazareth.<br> Almost everyone in cana knew him.<br> Now upon the first day of the week<br> very early in the morning<br> we came unto the sepulcher<br> and found the stone rolled away, rolled away<br> the great stone<br> was rolled away<br> and we entered into the sepulcher<br> and found not the body of jesus<br> and lo, a voice spake to us, saying:<br> "Why seek ye the living<br> among the dead, among the dead?"<br> "O seek not the living among the dead."<br> "For he said unto you in galilee<br> the son of man must be delivered<br> into the hands of sinful men<br> and be crucified and rise again, rise again."<br> "The son of man must rise again."<br> And lo, jesus appeared to us<br> and showed us his wounds<br> and he said unto us there:<br> "Go ye therefore, the blessed<br> and teach all the nations."<br> "And i am with you always."<br> "I am with you."<br> "I am with you<br> even to the end of the world."<br> - Who is she?<br> - Her name is miriam.<br> You've seen my grandson.<br> Miriam is another on whom jesus looked.<br> Another miracle?<br> If you want to use the word.<br> When she was 15,<br> she was struck down by paralysis.<br> It left her hopelessly crippled,<br> and hopelessly bitter about life.<br> She ate herself away with hate and consumed<br> everyone with her envy and malice.<br> - But she's still a cripple. She can't walk.<br> - No, she can't.<br> If he was such a magician,<br> why didn't he cure her?<br> He did.<br> I don't understand.<br> - Have you had supper?<br> - No.<br> Perhaps you will honor my poor house.<br> Thank you.<br> Then one day there was<br> a wedding here in cana.<br> The whole village took<br> part in it, all but miriam.<br> She stayed home and wept.<br> A wedding, you see, when no man<br> would look at her and her twisted body.<br> But when her parents returned to the house,<br> they found her, as she is now,<br> as you saw her, smiling and singing.<br> Was jesus at the wedding?<br> Yes. But he came late.<br> So now she spends her time<br> singing fables about the man.<br> But they're not fables.<br> Surely you don't believe<br> that he rose from the dead?<br> He lives more surely than we do.<br> He's dead. And no moonstruck girl<br> can sing him back to life again.<br> How do you know that he's dead?<br> A soldier told me.<br> A soldier who saw<br> the lance thrust into his side.<br> A soldier who was...<br> who was out there!<br> What's wrong?<br> Were you out there?<br> You're ill. Let me help you.<br> No. Let me alone.<br> Since the voyage, i've been indisposed.<br> Forgive me.<br> My master. These romans drink<br> like pigs, but they pay well.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I have news.<br> This peddler outside is fresh from jerusalem.<br> He says the governor has ordered the arrest<br> of all these fanatics called christians.<br> And for the leaders<br> they pay in gold, generously.<br> Justus is a leader, no?<br> I act under an imperial commission,<br> and i report to tiberius, not to pilate.<br> Fine. You are a rich tribune.<br> But what harm is it if i get<br> a few extra coins out of this?<br> Justus on the cross is worth<br> a year of good wine to me.<br> - Get back to damascus, abidor.<br> - But...<br> leave now. Tonight.<br> You won't get rid of me<br> so easily, worthy merchant.<br> These galileans are poor, but<br> they might pay well to know who you are.<br> And you are the man who crucified him.<br> You are his murderer, they are saying.<br> Stop! You are hurting me!<br> Let's go. Come on.<br> Kick him. Kick him.<br> - Kick him harder. Let's go.<br> - I'm kicking.<br> Go on, kick him. He'll go.<br> Kick him, that's it. He'll go. Kick him.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Kick him.<br> - Jonathan, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Letting your friend have a ride?<br> - No, i gave him the donkey.<br> - You gave him the donkey?<br> - Did your grandfather tell you to do that?<br> - No, sir. I did it myself.<br> Why are you so angry?<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> I didn't mean to eavesdrop.<br> I sit here so that i can watch people pass.<br> Well, wouldn't you be angry?<br> I gave him the donkey for himself.<br> Then it doesn't matter what he does with it.<br> I suppose not.<br> Is it that you resent<br> what our master taught us?<br> Why should i resent it?<br> He means nothing to me.<br> Then why do you consider him your enemy?<br> You see, we know<br> why you're here, marcellus.<br> It's simple, really. No merchant, even<br> a stupid one, would have paid those prices.<br> And the look of you, those shoulders.<br> We guessed at once what you were.<br> Sit down, please, here in<br> the shade. The sun's hot.<br> Why must you do this, marcellus?<br> Is it for rome?<br> Yes.<br> And for myself, to save my reason.<br> Justus said you were ill.<br> - There's one who can help.<br> - No.<br> - He was crucified. That was the end of him.<br> - That was the beginning.<br> He's with his father, but he left his word<br> with us and taught us how to use it.<br> Don't confess to sorcery.<br> You'll make things worse.<br> He was no sorcerer, marcellus.<br> He cast no spells.<br> He only asked two things of us: "love god,"<br> he said, "and love ye one another."<br> And he meant not only the jews, but<br> romans and greeks, slaves and soldiers,<br> the strong and the weak, everyone.<br> He asked us to build our lives<br> on this love, this charity.<br> - To build a new world.<br> - Worlds are built on force, not charity.<br> Power is all that counts.<br> Perhaps we have something<br> better than power. We have hope.<br> That you of all people should say that.<br> What do you mean, marcellus?<br> You say he could work miracles,<br> but he left you as he found you.<br> I used to wonder at that myself,<br> until faith taught me the answer.<br> He could have healed my body, and it would<br> have been natural for me to laugh and sing.<br> And then i came to understand that<br> he had done something even better for me.<br> He'd chosen me for his work.<br> He'd left me as i am so that all others like me<br> might know that misfortune needn't deprive<br> them of happiness within his kingdom.<br> It's beyond reason that<br> anybody should think as you do.<br> If you had only known him,<br> looked into his eyes, heard him speak...<br> - i did.<br> - I don't understand.<br> Please. It's enough.<br> You're in no danger from me.<br> I'm leaving. Now.<br> - We hoped you'd stay.<br> - Do you want to die?<br> - Of course not.<br> - Then let me go.<br> No one's holding you, marcellus.<br> But a man came here this morning<br> i wanted you to meet, the big fisherman.<br> - Fisherman?<br> - Simon the galilean.<br> The one jesus called peter.<br> Did he come alone?<br> No, he has a companion, a greek.<br> Where are they?<br> At shalum's inn. It's not far from here.<br> Marcellus?<br> I don't know what's in your heart.<br> I've tried to tell you what's in mine.<br> But it's clear that you're troubled,<br> and i wish i could help you.<br> Every man must find his own way,<br> but sometimes it's a comfort<br> to know that others, too,<br> have felt confused and lost.<br> Don't lose heart, marcellus.<br> The way is never easy,<br> but it's a path good men must take.<br> I hope you'll find yours.<br> The greek, demetrius. Where is he?<br> Up the stairs. The first door you see.<br> Stand up in the presence of your master.<br> That robe. Where is it?<br> The robe?<br> - Here.<br> - Keep away.<br> Sir, you look ill.<br> There. Burn it.<br> - Why?<br> - It cast a spell on me.<br> - It couldn't.<br> - I order you to burn it. Now.<br> Why are you afraid of it? I'm not.<br> It brings me close to the one who wore it.<br> I've ordered you to burn it.<br> That you will have to do yourself.<br> I'll have you whipped<br> and sold as a galley slave.<br> I'll teach you who's master here.<br> I know who my master is.<br> You're afraid, but you don't<br> really know the reason why.<br> You think it's his robe that made you ill.<br> But it's your own conscience,<br> your own decent shame.<br> Even when you crucified him you felt it.<br> The spell isn't in here,<br> it's in your heart and your mind.<br> Face it, marcellus. Don't be afraid of him.<br> He'd understand you.<br> He had compassion for all men.<br> Marcellus.<br> It was for your sake that he died.<br> For the sake of all of us.<br> No. No. No.<br> I am not afraid.<br> I'm not afraid.<br> Until now, you only remembered<br> what you did to a man.<br> The wrong, and your shame.<br> But now you remember the man.<br> Come, let me present you.<br> Marcellus gallio, tribune of rome.<br> Peter, fisherman of galilee.<br> A humble subject of the empire<br> is honored, tribune.<br> I think the honor is mine, sir.<br> Everybody, move closer.<br> Sit down, children. Closer, everybody.<br> Sit down. I want to talk to you.<br> Neighbors and friends, many of us<br> were privileged to know our master.<br> But none was as close to him<br> as our friend simon of galilee,<br> whom he loved as his own brother,<br> and whom he called peter.<br> On that terrible night when he was betrayed,<br> when some doubted and all fled his side,<br> only peter remained steadfast,<br> loyal to the end.<br> You may speak in a moment, peter.<br> Now it's my turn.<br> And so, my neighbors, on this happy day,<br> i welcome you here to honor...<br> stop it. Stop it!<br> Stop it. Stay where you are.<br> Advance. Advance.<br> Halt.<br> Well, tribune. Your new command?<br> Centurion, by what authority<br> do you attack these people?<br> I need no authority<br> to clean out a nest of traitors.<br> - Withdraw your men.<br> - And your authority, tribune?<br> - An imperial commission.<br> - I know you have it.<br> But it's no longer in effect.<br> Tiberius is dead.<br> Caligula is emperor.<br> Hits you hard, doesn't it?<br> - Men.<br> - Wait.<br> An imperial commission is good until it is<br> revoked by the emperor, whoever he may be.<br> - Have you new orders from caligula?<br> - No, but...<br> then obey mine.<br> Make me obey, tribune.<br> No. You won't try, will you?<br> Brave enough with a dice, or a cup of wine.<br> A tribune because you bear an important<br> name, because you have friends at court.<br> Well, you outrank me, but<br> i earned my rank, every step of it,<br> in gaul and lberia and africa,<br> against the enemies of rome.<br> With this.<br> Make me obey you, tribune,<br> if you're fool enough to try.<br> You are a fool.<br> I've split more men from head to foot<br> than you see in this square.<br> If i win, you'll keep your word?<br> You'll withdraw your men?<br> If you win, they'll be yours to command.<br> I'll be dead.<br> Well? What are you waiting for?<br> Finish it.<br> You may give that order now, centurion.<br> Column! Form square!<br> Prepare to march.<br> Formation, turn.<br> Column forward.<br> Marcellus?<br> Demetrius and i will leave in the morning.<br> We go to syria, lebanon, then greece,<br> sicily, and finally rome itself.<br> Everywhere we'll find friends.<br> Everywhere our movement grows.<br> And you, marcellus?<br> I suppose i'll go back to rome.<br> Demetrius and i<br> wondered if you'd come with us.<br> - You want me?<br> - We can always use courage and devotion.<br> No. No.<br> - It's impossible. I can never be one of you.<br> - Why not?<br> Marcellus, is there<br> something you want to tell me?<br> Yes.<br> Yes.<br> - I'll try.<br> - If it will make it easier,<br> let me tell you about the burden i carry.<br> You heard justus say<br> i was steadfast and loyal.<br> He didn't know.<br> The night jesus needed<br> me most, i denied him.<br> Not once, but three times.<br> I swore i never knew him.<br> Now.<br> I crucified him.<br> I know. Demetrius told me.<br> And you can forgive me?<br> He forgave you from the cross.<br> Can i do less?<br> Now, does anything stand in your way?<br> Can you be one of us?<br> From this day on,<br> i'm enlisted in his service.<br> I offer him my sword, my fortune and my life.<br> And this i pledge you<br> on my honor as a roman.<br> - Will you wait for me here, please?<br> - Yes, my lady.<br> The emperor will see you now.<br> The lady diana, as beautiful as ever.<br> - And as cold.<br> - You commanded my presence here, sire.<br> - Only because my invitations were ignored.<br> - I sent word that i was ill.<br> And you have chosen to be a guest of<br> senator gallio, who bears me no great love.<br> Shouldn't i consider<br> such behavior an affront?<br> You are the emperor, sire.<br> It is not in my power to affront you.<br> Good. Good.<br> Tell me, what news have the gallios had<br> of their precious son marcellus?<br> - None, sire.<br> - And you.<br> He must have written to you.<br> Not for almost a year.<br> His last letter was from<br> a village in palestine called cana.<br> And nothing since then?<br> Nothing from antioch,<br> or ephesus, or corinth?<br> You are telling the truth, aren't you?<br> Poor diana. He's played<br> you false, like the rest of us.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I mean he's here in rome,<br> and has been for some time.<br> - That's impossible.<br> - He fooled me, too.<br> I thought he was only a wastrel and a clown.<br> He's become one of the most<br> dangerous men in the empire,<br> a traitor and a conspirator against the state.<br> - No. Not marcellus.<br> - That's why he hasn't come to you,<br> or his family, or his friends.<br> You've heard of this new sect, these fanatics<br> who call themselves christians?<br> - He's one of them, one of the ringleaders.<br> - It can't be true.<br> No? Then come. I'll show you.<br> You'll learn for yourself what kind of man<br> it is you preferred to your emperor.<br> Where is he?<br> Marcellus's personal slave, remember?<br> The day he dared to bid against me.<br> But now no longer a slave.<br> His partner in treason.<br> - Has he talked?<br> - No, sire.<br> - Ask him again.<br> - Where is tribune gallio?<br> Where's he hiding?<br> Give him the wheel.<br> Three of them came here from corinth.<br> The greek slave, a jewish<br> fisherman, our loyal tribune.<br> We've caught one. Soon we'll have the others.<br> Where is he?<br> Give it to him.<br> Enough for now. He's no good to us dead.<br> Let him think about it for a while.<br> My lady. What's wrong?<br> It's marcellus.<br> They say he's alive.<br> He's here in rome.<br> - Who told you that?<br> - The emperor.<br> They have his slave in there.<br> They're torturing him.<br> - Demetrius is here in the palace?<br> - I saw him.<br> You're sure?<br> What is it, marcipor?<br> What do you know about it?<br> You've seen marcellus.<br> You're one of them. A christian.<br> Yes, my lady.<br> Take me to him.<br> - I can't.<br> - Do you think i'd betray him?<br> Take me to him.<br> Come.<br> Wait here.<br> - Where have they got demetrius?<br> - In the armory, below the guardroom.<br> I know the place.<br> - Where's peter?<br> - At the meeting in bovillae.<br> - He won't be back until midnight.<br> - Right. We can't wait for him.<br> Get me ten volunteers to come<br> with me as soon as it's dark.<br> I'll go, marcipor.<br> Why didn't you come?<br> Why have you kept away from me?<br> I would have come, soon.<br> But caligula's decreed against us.<br> - He said...<br> - i can imagine what he said.<br> Whatever you are, you're not a traitor.<br> - If you're still ill...<br> - no.<br> I'm well. Really well,<br> for the first time in my life.<br> You found the robe?<br> Yes.<br> Here it is.<br> Here.<br> Why, it's just ordinary homespun.<br> - Was it really bewitched?<br> - In a way.<br> It changed my life.<br> In time, it will change the world.<br> I don't understand.<br> It's a long story. And a strange one.<br> - About the robe?<br> - Yes.<br> About the robe, and the one who wore it.<br> - It's nearly dark.<br> - Good.<br> Send marcipor to me when he comes back.<br> Why are you dressed like that?<br> No, marcellus. They'll kill you.<br> - You must have faith.<br> - Faith in what? This new god of yours?<br> He couldn't save his own son.<br> They crucified him and they'll kill you, too.<br> - I can't leave demetrius to be tortured.<br> - But you'll leave me.<br> I love you. Does this dream of yours<br> mean more to you than our love?<br> Marcellus, what you've told me<br> is a beautiful story, but it isn't true.<br> Justice and charity. Men will<br> never accept such a philosophy.<br> The world isn't like that.<br> It never has been, and it never will be.<br> Why must you throw<br> your life away for a slave?<br> I owe him a great deal more than my life.<br> If your god means that much to you,<br> i won't stand in your way.<br> I want to be your wife whatever you believe.<br> I'd marry you if i had to<br> share you with a thousand gods.<br> Ready.<br> Oh, my love.<br> Take her home.<br> Diana, i'll come to you as soon as i can.<br> Keep the robe for me.<br> - Sentry, come with me.<br> - What's the watchword, tribune?<br> - Hurry, you fool.<br> - Guard!<br> Who's there?<br> Stop. You. Stop.<br> Get the boy up.<br> On the emperor's business. Open up.<br> What business, tribune?<br> If you're in command, my message is for you.<br> You're not one of the praetorian tribunes.<br> I know them all.<br> Now!<br> The keys. The keys, quick.<br> Quickly now.<br> I can't believe you let them take<br> an imperial prisoner from the palace itself.<br> Tribune quintus, where<br> were you when this happened?<br> - I could send you to the galleys.<br> - The greek was nearly dead.<br> - By now he's a corpse.<br> - The greek? Who cares about the greek?<br> Or the jew fisherman<br> or any of the rest of them?<br> I want the roman traitor who's responsible,<br> who made fools of the praetorian guard.<br> I want tribune gallio. I want him<br> in my hands before sunrise.<br> I want him alive. I want him<br> to stand before me alive.<br> Do you hear me? Find him<br> or you'll all go to the galleys.<br> Tear the city apart if you have to.<br> But find him!<br> Now, get out, all of you.<br> Go.<br> - Anything?<br> - No, sir.<br> - And you?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Upstairs?<br> - No, sir.<br> Detail, form.<br> Senator.<br> Detail, march.<br> - I can barely feel the heartbeat.<br> - He can't die.<br> - Is he such a valuable slave?<br> - He's one of the most valuable men alive.<br> - Well, he won't be alive for long.<br> - You're a physician.<br> There are limits to what science can achieve.<br> I can't put shattered flesh together again,<br> nor restore the blood he's lost.<br> Father in heaven, he was<br> the bravest and best of thy servants.<br> Why hast thou abandoned him?<br> Let me be alone with him.<br> You stay, marcellus. And you, diana.<br> Who is this man? Is he a physician?<br> No. Please go.<br> For my sake, sir. Please.<br> Demetrius.<br> Demetrius.<br> - What's he doing in there? Who is he?<br> - I've never seen him before.<br> Senator gallio should inform himself<br> about what goes on in his own household,<br> with his own son.<br> This is my house, sir.<br> You were called here as a physician,<br> - not to question my family's behavior.<br> - I'm a physician, but first of all a roman.<br> And i must tell you bluntly that...<br> - he's gone?<br> - We didn't even thank him.<br> What did he do?<br> You were here. You saw it.<br> - Yes, he...<br> - can't you speak?<br> Are you bewitched?<br> So that's it. Sorcery.<br> Doesn't your friend know the penalty<br> for pretending to heal by such methods?<br> Pretending?<br> Marius, you did everything<br> in your power, and we're grateful.<br> - Come, stay and eat with us.<br> - No, thank you.<br> There are mysteries to life and death, yes.<br> Patients have made astonishing recoveries.<br> But i have never ascribed them to the magic<br> of a sorcerer. Good night to you, senator.<br> Tribune.<br> Do you think he'll go to caligula?<br> I think he's a proud man<br> and his pride's been hurt.<br> Well, if your slave's fit to be moved,<br> you'd better take him back to the catacombs.<br> Marcipor? Order a carriage<br> and two men to help me with demetrius.<br> Sir.<br> I'd like to see you again,<br> to tell you more about our...<br> we are seeing each other for the last time.<br> You have chosen to make<br> yourself an enemy of rome.<br> From this night on, i have no son.<br> I've brought something for you.<br> Tomorrow i'll send for you.<br> - All ready, sir.<br> - Yes.<br> Tomorrow.<br> We're being followed.<br> Faster. Faster.<br> - Stop at the bridge.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - No, don't.<br> - For all you've been to me, thanks.<br> Into the carriage.<br> Get him to peter.<br> Good-bye, friend.<br> Good-bye, friend.<br> I can only give you a few moments.<br> Diana.<br> I prayed that i'd see you again.<br> We haven't much time, marcellus, so listen.<br> Tomorrow you're to be put on trial<br> before the entire court.<br> - I never thought i'd get a trial.<br> - Your father's powerful.<br> Caligula can'tjust kill you.<br> He's forced to prove that you're guilty.<br> He'll have no trouble proving it.<br> It's up to you, marcellus.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Don't defy caligula.<br> Your god doesn't want you to die. He can't.<br> Otherwise he wouldn't have<br> sent peter to save demetrius.<br> I'm afraid, diana.<br> In cana i lived with people<br> who were not afraid.<br> People who'd met jesus face to face,<br> who'd spoken with him,<br> eaten and laughed with him.<br> A crippled girl who thought<br> herself fortunate to be lame.<br> A weaver whose words were like his work:<br> Simple, and lasting, and strong.<br> A little boy who gave his donkey to a friend.<br> Never again in his life would he own<br> anything as fine as that donkey,<br> and yet he gave it happily,<br> without a second thought.<br> If these people had denied him<br> one after the other, to save their skins,<br> would he have any followers left?<br> I want to think as you do.<br> I want to be like those people,<br> but i can't do it alone.<br> I can't do it without you.<br> My faith in what you told me<br> isn't strong enough.<br> If you die, i'll believe<br> that you died for nothing.<br> My lady, you'll have to go now.<br> Please, marcellus.<br> I need you.<br> Senator, the emperor wishes<br> to speak to you and the lady diana.<br> Greetings to our loyal senator.<br> The proceedings here today will interest you.<br> - Sire, i am not in the mood for...<br> - patience.<br> - If my son is to be put on trial...<br> - patience!<br> You will sit by me.<br> Thank you, sire, but<br> my place is with the senator.<br> Your place is where your emperor decides.<br> Isn't that so, senator?<br> - You don't look very happy.<br> - Have i reason to be?<br> There isn't a woman in rome<br> who wouldn't pray for this honor.<br> There's only one man<br> at whose side i pray to sit.<br> Before this day is out, you will<br> be praying on your knees to me.<br> For his life.<br> Senators, romans...<br> as you know, there exists today<br> in our empire, and even in rome itself,<br> a secret party of seditionists<br> who call themselves christians.<br> They have enlisted in their ranks the riffraff<br> of the plebeian class, as well as slaves.<br> We have known slave uprisings in the past.<br> We remember spartacus.<br> But now it grieves us to inform you<br> that one of our own tribunes<br> has betrayed his trust<br> and joined this party of conspirators.<br> You, not we, shall be<br> the judges of his treason.<br> Bring in tribune marcellus gallio.<br> Tribune gallio, you have been informed<br> of the charges against you?<br> I have, sire.<br> You stand before<br> the senators and nobles of rome.<br> They wait to hear your defense.<br> It is true that i am a christian.<br> It is not true that those of us<br> who follow the teachings of jesus<br> are engaged in any plot against the state.<br> But isn't it a fact that<br> you call this jesus a king?<br> Yes, sire.<br> But his kingdom is not of this world.<br> He seeks no earthly throne.<br> He reigns over the hearts and minds of men<br> in the name ofjustice and charity.<br> And are these virtues<br> not to be found in our empire?<br> Was itjustice, or was it charity<br> that gave me my orders<br> when i put him to death on the cross?<br> You put him to death?<br> Then why are you risking your life for him?<br> I owe him more than my life.<br> - He forgave me my crime against him.<br> - Crime?<br> Do you maintain that it's a crime<br> for a roman soldier to obey his orders?<br> The empire is governed by men.<br> Men sometimes make mistakes. And this<br> was the greatest mistake ever made by rome.<br> So, the empire makes mistakes.<br> And perhaps the emperor<br> himself makes mistakes?<br> Sire,<br> it is i who am on trial here, not you.<br> What's that thing you're holding?<br> His robe. He wore it to the cross.<br> Let me see it.<br> No. I remember. It's bewitched.<br> - No, sire.<br> - You. Take it.<br> - Destroy it.<br> - Sire, may i keep it?<br> Sorcery too.<br> Did you think it would protect you here?<br> - No, sire.<br> - Tell me, tribune.<br> Do you expect us to believe stories that<br> jesus could heal by the touch of his hand,<br> make the crippled walk<br> and the blind see again?<br> It makes no difference whether<br> you believe them or not, sire.<br> All that matters is that there's no story<br> that he ever made anyone blind,<br> no story that he made anyone a cripple,<br> or ever raised his hand except to heal.<br> Sire, if you'd had the chance i had,<br> to talk with those who knew him,<br> to learn what was in his heart...<br> stop. Are you trying<br> to convert me to your treason?<br> I only want to show you<br> your opportunity, sire.<br> If the empire desires peace<br> and brotherhood among all men,<br> then my king will be on the side<br> of rome and her emperor.<br> But if the empire and the emperor pursue<br> the course of aggression and slavery<br> that have brought agony<br> and despair to the world,<br> if there's nothing left but chains and hunger,<br> then my king will march<br> to right those wrongs.<br> Not tomorrow, sire. Your majesty may not<br> witness the establishment of his kingdom.<br> But it will come.<br> You have heard him. He stands<br> convicted out of his own mouth.<br> What is your pleasure?<br> Death.<br> Death.<br> You see? It is the will of the people.<br> The will of your slaves and parasites.<br> How dare you speak ofjustice?<br> He's not a traitor. You haven't<br> proved that and you never will.<br> Then listen. You will see that i am just.<br> Listen. Tribune gallio,<br> you stand condemned to death.<br> But it is our desire to be merciful.<br> We give you a chance<br> to recant your treason and go free.<br> Kneel to us and renew your oath<br> of loyalty to your emperor.<br> Renounce your allegiance to this dead jew<br> who dared to call himself a king.<br> Sire...<br> with all my heart i renew my pledge<br> of loyalty to my emperor and to rome,<br> a pledge which i have never broken.<br> And the other? Jesus?<br> Renounce him, so all can hear.<br> I cannot renounce him, sire. Nor can you.<br> He is my king and yours as well.<br> He is the son of god.<br> - And that is your answer?<br> - Yes, sire.<br> Tribune gallio, we decree that you be taken<br> immediately to the palace archery field<br> and put to death for high treason.<br> No, diana. There's no reason for it.<br> Sire, marcellus is my chosen husband.<br> - I ask to go with him.<br> - Stand back.<br> You're not on trial.<br> There's no evidence against you.<br> Then if it please you, sire,<br> i'll provide evidence.<br> I have no wish to live another hour<br> in an empire ruled by you.<br> You dare to call yourself a caesar.<br> Once the caesars of rome were noble, but<br> in you noble blood has turned to poison.<br> You corrupt rome with spite and malice.<br> - Stop. Stop it!<br> - That you should be caesar!<br> Vicious, treacherous, drunk with power.<br> An evil, insane monster posing as emperor.<br> Stop it!<br> As for me, i have found another king.<br> I want to go with my husband<br> into his kingdom.<br> Then by the gods you shall.<br> Go. Both of you. Into your kingdom!<br> They're going into a better kingdom.<br> They're going into a better kingdom.<br> They're going to meet their king.<br> They're going to meet their king.<br> For the big fisherman.<br>
