What's it mean?<br> This.<br> And this.<br> Just think.<br> A week ago Friday<br> I didn't know boys existed.<br> Did you know girls existed<br> before the dance?<br> I knew they existed.<br> Do you remember what you said<br> to me on the dance floor?<br> "Honey, you are dancing too close. "<br> Well, it was hot in the gym,<br> and the floor was crowded.<br> When my girlfriend was teaching<br> me how to dance, I asked her,<br> "How do you know which way<br> the boy is going to move?"<br> And she said,<br> "You've got to feel how the boy's<br> going to move with your body. "<br> I said,<br> "How do you feel<br> with your body?"<br> And she said,<br> "By pressing up close. "<br> That's why I pressed up close.<br> I didn't realize that I was.<br> You're blushing.<br> Don't go away.<br> And a few minutes later<br> you said to me,<br> "Gee, you're beautiful. "<br> I said, "Excuse me,"<br> and I ran to the ladies' room.<br> Do you know why?<br> To look at myself in the mirror.<br> For the first time in my life,<br> I felt I was beautiful.<br> You made me feel beautiful<br> when you said I was.<br> You are beautiful, Rosa.<br> So much, I...<br> Sta' zitta, cretina.<br> - I knew somebody was in here.<br> - Mama?<br> - Are you there, Mama?<br> - No, no.

"<br> "Oh, love. "<br> I had married a rose.<br> I didn't know I was<br> going to marry a rose.<br> I couldn't speak nothing in English<br> except, "Oh, love. "<br> "Oh, love. "<br> "Oh, love. " Oh, Father!<br> I can't breathe in this building.<br> I can't breathe in this building<br> where I was married, Father.<br> Serafina. Serafina.<br> I am not going to spare<br> your feelings, Serafina.<br> I'm gonna talk to you honestly,<br> as your spiritual father.<br> I am shocked. I am shocked<br> at the change in your...<br> In your appearance and behavior<br> since the loss of your husband.<br> Grief is a natural and dignified thing,<br> but like every other emotion, Serafina,<br> it can become excessive.<br> Then... Then it becomes<br> a sort of self-indulgence.<br> I knew this was going to happen<br> when you refused to obey<br> the laws of the church<br> and had your husband cremated.<br> I remember you dressed in blue silk.<br> Yes, yes. Like a lady wearing<br> a piece of the weather.<br> You walked tall and proud.<br> Now, you crouch and you shuffle.<br> You... You live and dress<br> like a convict.<br> You have no companions.<br> You're rude to your neighbors.<br> You don't mix with the women who...<br> They make the life without glory.<br> They make the life without glory.<br> I gave my husband much glory.<br> I was the peasant,<br> but I gave him glory.<br> I came to him with one dress,<br> but I brought him glory.<br> He was a baron,<br> and I brought him glory.<br> I brought him glory, glory.<br> Glory.<br> I don't believe that he took this glory<br> I gave him and gave me horns.<br> I don't believe he gave me horns,<br> Father!<br> What do you want from me?<br> Go to the bingo.<br> - Per I'amor di Dio.<br> - Go!<br> Serafina, the ladies only want<br> to be your friends.<br> Friendly?<br> They think they know something<br> that Serafina don't know.<br> They think I have these on my head.<br> But I ain't. No, I ain't!<br> Serafina, I think you<br> imagine too much.<br> The ladies want to be<br> your companions.<br> Companions. Them ladies.<br> The dummies I got in my house,<br> they make much better companions,<br> because they don't make up no lies.<br> No, no. What kind of ladies<br> are them women, huh?<br> At 30 years old, they got<br> no more use for the marriage,<br> except for the money,<br> the shoes, the food.<br> - What do you call this kind of ladies?<br> - Attenzione.<br> To me the marriage was beautiful,<br> like a religion.<br> Now my marriage<br> is dreams and memories only.<br> And I don't believe that the man<br> I keep in my heart gave me horns.<br> I don't believe, no!<br> I don't believe!<br> I don't believe he gave me horns!<br> The whole village is... Well,<br> the whole village is laughing at you.<br> Me too, I'm laughing.<br> - Listen to me! I'm laughing too!<br> - Serafina.<br> - Laughing!<br> - Serafina Delle Rose.<br> - Why aren't you laughing anymore?<br> - I think you had better go home.<br> - Serafina.<br> - No.<br> I think you had better go home.<br> Yes, I'll talk to you later.<br> No. Later's too late, Father.<br> You've got to tell me now.<br> Tell you what?<br> You used to... You used to hear<br> the confession of my husband.<br> Father, please,<br> did my husband ever speak of a...?<br> - Of a woman to you?<br> - Serafina.<br> Oh, Father, rispondetemi...<br> ...this one question.<br> Did he ever speak of a woman to you?<br> - Serafina, how...?<br> - Tell...<br> - How can I tell you something I...?<br> - Tell me, Father. You got to tell me.<br> Serafina...<br> - Father, tell me. Please, tell me.<br> - Serafina.<br> You know better than to ask me<br> such a question.<br> The secrets of the confessional<br> are sacred to the priests.<br> - I know.<br> - They are never...<br> - They are never repeated.<br> - I know, but tell me.<br> You got to tell me.<br> - Tell me, Father.<br> - Please, Serafina. Let go of me.<br> Not till you tell me this question,<br> this answer. I want it. I want it.<br> Let go of me. Let go of me.<br> - Tell me, I let go.<br> - Let go of me.<br> - You don't tell, I never let go.<br> - Please.<br> I go mad! I go crazy! I never let go!<br> I never let go, Father.<br> - I tell you, Father.<br> - Mr. Mangiacavallo.<br> Mr. Mangiacavallo, please help me<br> calm this woman down.<br> I'll speak to her later,<br> when she's more calm.<br> Father! Father!<br> Oh, please. Please.<br> Father De Leo!<br> Father De Leo!<br> Father De Leo, tell me please.<br> Tell me, please. Tell me, please.<br> Tell me. Tell me.<br> Come on.<br> You'll be all right.<br> - Where am I?<br> - This... This is my truck.<br> It's OK.<br> - No, where...?<br> - You're OK.<br> I drive you home from the church.<br> You rest.<br> I'm sorry I couldn't take<br> you home in a taxicab.<br> But I'm a bachelor<br> with three dependents,<br> I can't afford no cab fare.<br> And you didn't have a purse with you.<br> Oh, yeah. Where is my purse?<br> - Did you have a purse with you?<br> - I think so. I don't know.<br> You want to go back and get it?<br> - We'll look for it?<br> - No, no, no.<br> - You sure?<br> - I want to go home, please.<br> That's almost where you are now.<br> When somebody else<br> is crying I gotta cry too.<br> I'm sympathetic.<br> I got too much of a heart.<br> Don't cry. Why should you cry?<br> I know. It ain't like a man.<br> Oh, a man sometimes<br> has to cry like anyone else.<br> You're very understanding.<br> Sometimes a man has to cry<br> the same as a woman.<br> A man is not so different<br> from anyone else.<br> - Take it.<br> - Oh, grazie.<br> You stop that, then I'll stop too, huh?<br> No, you stop first, and I'll stop.<br> No, you first.<br> Ladies first, you know?<br> Ladies first.<br> I stop. OK?<br> OK, me too. I stop, see?<br> Your shirt is torn, huh?<br> Oh, yes, Mrs. Delle Rose.<br> You tore it when I pulled you<br> away from the priest.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I'll sew it for you.<br> - Oh, that's nothing. It's nothing.<br> - Forget it.<br> - I'll sew it for you. Come on.<br> I'm ready to laugh now.<br> Oh, my.<br> I'm sorry you lost your pocketbook,<br> you know?<br> How much money you got<br> in the pocketbook? Much?<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Let me worry about it.<br> Give me your shirt.<br> And, please, will you<br> open the shutters for me?<br> - I can't see.<br> - Oh, sure.
