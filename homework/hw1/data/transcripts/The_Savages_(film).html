Okay?<br> - We don't even know where the man lives anymore.<br> You want to know where he lives?<br> Sun City.<br> Have you ever heard of that?<br> In the middle of the desert somewhere.<br> We're gonna have to<br> go out there and find him.<br> We are not gonna have to<br> go out there and find him.<br> Wendy, we are not<br> in a Sam Sheppard play.<br> We're gonna have to do something.<br> This is a crisis.<br> Look, I don't think<br> this actually qualifies as a crisis.<br> It's an alarm, okay?<br> But it's not a crisis, not yet.<br> - You mean, it's like we're in Orange.<br> - What?<br> Yeah. Right, exactly.<br> But we're in Yellow, okay?<br> So we should just... be aware...<br> and be cautious.<br> And when it hits Red,<br> then we're in trouble.<br> Okay?<br> Your color, right?<br> Ms. Metzger?

Oh, great.<br> Look, I need a favor.<br> Well, it's kind of last minute.<br> I'm out of town, actually.<br> Arizona.<br> Yeah, it's a family thing.<br> No, nothing serious. It's my father.<br> No, he's just, uh...<br> his girlfriend died.<br> Yeah. And, uh, he's getting pretty old<br> himself, I guess, like everybody.<br> Yeah. Well, that's what<br> I was gonna ask you.<br> It's my 9:00 am. on Monday.<br> "Oedipal Rage and Beckett,"<br> of all things.<br> - I have to stop at baggage claim.<br> - Hold on. Hold on a second.<br> - You checked luggage? We're only here for a day.<br> - Two days and one night.<br> Excuse me<br> if I plan on changing my clothes.<br> Sorry. Uh, it's my sister.<br> - I gained some weight.<br> - I didn't say anything.<br> Kasia didn't have you pack<br> a button-down?<br> - What is this, a goddamn fashion show?<br> - No.<br> It's just, when someone dies,<br> people dress up.<br> She's moving back to Poland.<br> - What, you and Kasia broke up?<br> - Her visa expired.<br> S... So that's it?<br> Her visa expires, so... so it's over?<br> Well, it's either that<br> or we get married...<br> and no one's ready for that, okay?<br> You've been together for over three years.<br> You're 42 years old...<br> Wendy, I really don't need romantic advice<br> from my little sister at the moment.<br> Let's just take care of the situation<br> and stay out of each other's shit, okay?<br> I'm just trying to talk about it.<br> Well, we're not in therapy right now.<br> We're in real life.<br> Oh, here. I almost forgot.<br> Shoot. We have to sign this.<br> They didn't have a very big selection.<br> Is this okay?<br> "These words, we hope,<br> may ease your loss.<br> "Our prayers are with you,<br> our love, our thoughts.<br> So this is sent with some"...<br> Here.<br> Don't forget the balloon.<br> You must be Leonard's kids.<br> Uh-huh.<br> The hospital's just five minutes away.<br> And don't worry. It's nothing serious.<br> He's been feeling kind of faint...<br> and what with<br> the toileting incident and all...<br> the doctor thought a few tests<br> were in order.<br> Well, I guess...<br> I guess we should be going then.<br> - We're really sorry about your mom.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Uh, Jon, Wendy...<br> One more thing before you go.<br> Please sit.<br> I just want to say...<br> you know, we love Lenny.<br> He's been like family to us, but...<br> he's not really our family...<br> he's yours.<br> So...<br> I hope you'll be able to find<br> someplace nice for him.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - She means a place where he can live.<br> - Right. He lives here.<br> - That's correct.<br> Your father's been living off the charity<br> of our family for quite some time.<br> - Bill-<br> - Why would you say charity, Bill?<br> Doris asked my father to come live<br> with her as a boyfriend, not a boarder.<br> They were a couple.<br> They were together for over 20 years.<br> You can't just throw the man<br> out on the street.<br> He has a right to live here. Legally speaking,<br> it's a common law marriage at this point.<br> Not exactly.<br> Not in front of the kids, Bill.<br> Let's step outside.<br> So, was Lenny there<br> when this was signed?<br> Notarized, all legal.<br> It's called a non-marital agreement.<br> It's like a prenupt without the nap.<br> It says that even though<br> they lived together...<br> they have no legal obligation to each other,<br> that everything's separate.<br> And, basically, Dad has no legal right<br> to any of her property.<br> Bet you they've already<br> got the place listed.<br> Did you notice that there wasn't<br> one picture of us anywhere?<br> Are you surprised?<br> It's like we don't even exist.<br> ...on your toughest stains.<br> How about this coffee stain on my blouse?<br> I'll add some things<br> and make it really messy.<br> Oxy Clean seeks out stains<br> and works right before your eyes.<br> Grass and dirt don't stand a chance<br> against new Oxy Clean.<br> It tackles grass, dirt and grease better<br> than ever.

He's a professor.<br> I thought my boy was a doctor.<br> Doctor of Philosophy.<br> PhD.

He can fall.<br> - We'll keep an eye on him.<br> Thank you.<br> Vascular dementia or multi-infarct...<br> usually follow one or more strokes...<br> but I'm not seeing<br> any sign of a stroke here.<br> But the disinhibition,<br> the aggression, masked facials...<br> with a blank stare that we had talked about<br> earlier, are all fairly good indicators.<br> - Is it like Alzheimer's?<br> - There are a lot of illnesses that can cause dementia.<br> I'm not prepared to make<br> a diagnosis yet, but I think...<br> his symptoms are much more<br> characteristic of Parkinson's disease.<br> So, w... what do we have<br> to look forward to?<br> Well, he's not a young man, so cardiac<br> or respiratory failure may spare him...<br> from the worst of it, but, uh,<br> tremors when the limb is at rest...<br> a shuffling walk, freezing up,<br> unable to initiate movement...<br> more and more loss<br> of motor coordination in general.<br> You make me feel so young<br> You make me feel<br> like spring has sprung<br> And every time I see you grin<br> I'm such a happy individual<br> The moment that you speak<br> I want to go play hide and seek<br> I want to go and bounce the moon<br> Just like a toy balloon<br> You and I<br> Are just like a couple of tots<br> Running across the meadow<br> Picking up...<br> Maybe Dad didn't abandon us.<br> Maybe he just forgot who we were.<br> - I'm gonna give Brian Deener a call.<br> - Who's that?<br> He's a friend of mine,<br> teaches in the English department.<br> He just put his mother<br> in a nursing home near campus.<br> Could we have some more nuts?<br> - Nursing home?<br> - Yeah. What?<br> - I wasn't thinking about putting him in a nursing home.<br> - What were you thinking?<br> - I don't know, but I wasn't thinking that.<br> - Where else is he gonna live?<br> I mean, really, what's the alternative?<br> You want to-<br> - You want to change Dad's diapers, wipe his ass?<br> - He doesn't need diapers.<br> - What do you think that catheter was?<br> - He's in the hospital.<br> You make me feel-<br> But look, even if they did<br> let Dad stay here...<br> he'd still have to have somebody take care<br> of him. We can't afford that.<br> You heard the nurse.<br> Dad falls. He's disoriented.<br> He hasn't fallen once<br> since we've been here.<br> Don't make me out to be the evil brother<br> who's putting away our father against your will.<br> All right,<br> we're doing this together, right?<br> Two of a kind<br> for your information<br> We're two of a kind<br> Well, there's places.<br> - What places?<br> - Like Aunt Gertie.<br> That's assisted living.

Bye.<br> Hey, Wendy?

Hello?<br> Hello. Who is it?<br> - Hung up.<br> - Book Expo was the big...<br> So, not only do you have a formal<br> dining room, if you like to entertain...<br> but you also have an updated kitchen<br> with granite countertops...<br> oak cabinets,<br> brand-new appliances...<br> and they all convey to the new owner.<br> And look at this dramatic view...<br> of the eighth tee<br> on the Lake West golf course.<br> How perfect is this?<br> You're also only<br> a five-minute stroll from...<br> When you purchase a home<br> in Sun City, you're eligible...<br> recreation centers.<br> We have eight golf courses...<br> Sure. We could try maybe 30 days.<br> No, they're already pre-approved...<br> so it's not gonna take any time at all.<br> Okay, I'll see you about 3:00.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi.<br> Oh, my God, Jon. You are not...<br> You are not gonna believe this.<br> I just... I found this stash...<br> of photographs and stuff<br> that Dad's kept all these years.<br> I can't believe it. I'm looking at<br> the funniest picture of you right now.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - You have braces.<br> How come you got braces?<br> I never got braces.<br> Ever looked at my teeth?<br> They're still crooked.<br> Oh, yeah. How come?<br> 'Cause Dad never paid the bills,<br> and the orthodontist was so pissed off...<br> he pulled them out of my mouth<br> before my teeth were fixed.<br> So I think I found something.<br> What?<br> It's a place with an opening<br> that can take him right away.<br> What kind of place?<br> A... A facility for older people.<br> In this country,<br> they call 'em nursing homes.<br> I thought we were gonna try<br> assisted living.<br> They're not gonna take him at<br> assisted living, Wendy. Let's just be real.<br> - He's got dementia.<br> - Well, don't lead with that.<br> Look, if it's any consolation,<br> uh, this place...<br> they don't call it a... a nursing home.<br> - Well, what do they call it?<br> - Uh, rehabilitation center.<br> It's called the Valley View.<br> That sounds nice.<br> - Is it?<br> - It's a nursing home, Wendy.<br> - Does it smell?<br> - Yeah, it smells. They all smell.<br> Look, this place has an empty bed,<br> they take Medicaid and it's close to my house.<br> Believe me, once you get inside,<br> these places are all the same.<br> - Hello?<br> - Make sure you have a coat for him when we get there.<br> He doesn't have any warm clothes.<br> - Hi, Dad.<br> - Hiya.<br> How ya feelin'?<br> Not bad.<br> You don't need these, right?<br> Not your style.<br> Look like Grandpa Walton.<br> Okay, just sign and initial at the X's.<br> And here are your valuables.<br> New prescription.

I need ten bucks.<br> - Where is he?<br> - Inside.<br> Thank you. Pop the trunk.<br> - Did you remember the coat?<br> - Yeah. I can't, uh, leave the car unattended.<br> I'm sorry.<br> ...the diplomats<br> were referring to intelligence reports...<br> that North Korea had loaded booster<br> rockets onto a launch pad...<br> and moved fuel tanks to the test site...<br> in preparation for a possible launch<br> as early as tomorrow.<br> We don't usually admit<br> but I understand<br> you came a long way.<br> Isn't that right, Mr. Savage?<br> - What'd you say?<br> - You came a long way.<br> Not too bad.<br> How about Bingo?<br> You like Bingo, Mr. Savage?<br> Every Tuesday and Thursday night.<br> Don't like it.<br> That's Winston.<br> We call him The Mayor.<br> All right.

Well, I'll leave you alone to, uh,<br> look around and get yourselves together.<br> Gonna need you to sign some papers.<br> - I'll send somebody in to get him ready for bed.<br> - Okay.<br> Good evening, sir.

Up.<br> Come on.<br> Like you're under arrest.<br> Good man.<br> You ever done time, Mr. Savage?<br> It's a good idea not to make too big of a thing<br> when you leave for the first time.<br> Just go real casual.<br> No big good-byes.<br> We don't wanna get him agitated before<br> he's had time to settle in to his new home.<br> - All right.<br> - Thank you.<br> Don't worry.<br> We'll take good care of him.<br> - Is everything okay, Dad?<br> - Not bad.<br> All right then. See ya tomorrow.<br> Good night, Dad.<br> Hey.<br> Don't forget to tip the girl<br> on the way out.<br> All right.<br> What's the matter?<br> He didn't... he didn't<br> even know where we were taking him.<br> He still doesn't know.<br> He doesn't know where he is, Wendy.<br> We are horrible,<br> horrible, horrible people.<br> We are horrible!<br> Horrible!<br> Just horrible.<br> Horrible.<br> Looks like the Unabomber lives here.<br> Yeah, well, I've been doing<br> a lot of research for the book.<br> The couch is actually pretty comfortable.<br> Great.

This looks nice.<br> It's in Vermont. I really wish<br> you hadn't brought that down.<br> - Jon.<br> - What?<br> - What is it?<br> - Theatre of the Absurd.<br> You gonna stop?<br> Yeah.<br> Sorry.<br> Sorry.<br> We're doing the right thing, Wen.<br> We're taking better care of the old man<br> than he ever did of us.<br> I know.<br> Good night.<br> We know this is one<br> of the toughest decisions of your life.<br> What to do when the parent<br> who took care of you...<br> can no longer take care of themselves?<br> That's why here, at Greenhill Manor...<br> we are committed to providing<br> the highest quality of care...<br> for your loved ones.<br> Our board-certified physicians<br> are dedicated...<br> to maximizing both the physical...<br> and emotional well-being<br> of your elder.<br> Come celebrate 100 years<br> of award-winning care.<br> Heaven<br> I'm in heaven<br> And my heart beats so<br> that I can hardly speak<br> And exhale.<br> And I seem to find<br> the happiness I seek<br> And breathe it up.<br> And breathe up wonderful, good energy.<br> Fill yourself with it.<br> And let go of everything you don't need.<br> Ahh.<br> Good.

I'm just...<br> It's just a really hard thing to get<br> is all.<br> - I applied for it a half dozen times.<br> - I never got one.<br> Well, I did.<br> Why is that so hard for you to believe?<br> - No,<br> - I believe it. I just can't believe you've been keeping it a secret.<br> - I just found out.<br> - Just now?<br> Oh, my God. It's... amazing.<br> That's really great, Wen.<br> I, huh... I'm really proud of you.<br> You are?<br> Yeah, it's amazing. It's major.<br> It's, um...<br> I mean, maybe this is your...<br> your time, you know. Your year.<br> Look, how about we both work here<br> and ride out the holidays together...<br> and get lots of writing done,<br> and, you know, we... it'll be fun.<br> We'll inspire each other.<br> Uh, our own little writers' colony.<br> I'm really proud of you, Wen.<br> You stole painkillers from a dead woman?<br> - Mmm.<br> - Do they work?<br> Mm, mm, mm, mm.<br> Salud.<br> Bye.<br> Ihr saht den weisen Salomon<br> Ihr wiesst,<br> was aus ihm wurde<br> Dem Mann war alles sonnenklar<br> Er verfluchte<br> die Stunde seiner Geburt<br> Und sah<br> Da alles eitel war<br> Wie gro und weis<br> War Salomon<br> Und seht,<br> da war es noch nicht Nacht<br> Da sah<br> die Welt die Folgen schon<br> Die Weisheit hatte ihn<br> so weit gebracht<br> Beneidenswert,<br> wer frei davon<br> - You're in my apartment?<br> - I'm on your bed with Marley.<br> She's got one of your T-shirts.<br> Mm-mm!<br> It smells like you,<br> like, uh, lavender and sweat.<br> Genghis is here, too.<br> I'm totally getting a hard-on.<br> - Will you please...<br> - Sorry.<br> - How's Genghis?<br> - She's good.

Are you here<br> for the support group?<br> You have a family member with dementia?<br> Okay, well, you're in the right place.<br> Just grab a couple packets and welcome.<br> And there's room up front.<br> We won't hurt you.<br> You've probably been hurt enough already.<br> We're talking about activities you can share<br> with your confused elder on visiting day.<br> I culled that list from a terrific book.<br> You laugh, but I love this series.<br> When my mother was diagnosed<br> with Parkinsons, this was my bible.<br> ask your elder about the old days. "<br> Okay, now I know that sounds<br> pretty obvious...<br> but when you're dealing with dementia,<br> you have to work extra hard at this.<br> You can't just sit on the side of the bed,<br> asking questions.<br> Bring things in<br> to stimulate their memory.<br> Old movies are a terrific so...<br> Excuse me!<br> Uh, we... we haven't served<br> the refreshments yet.<br> Uh, photographs, that seems obvious.<br> Uh, movies from the-<br> from their era, again,<br> can also be very powerful.<br> Oh.<br> Is that your neighborhood, Dad?<br> Yep.<br> They got that right.<br> There she is.<br> - Who?<br> - You see her?<br> She's cooking my dinner for me.<br> - That bastard.<br> - That's the father, Dad.<br> - Hey, you son of a bitch!<br> - Shut up. Will you shut up?<br> You shut yourself up!<br> It's my night!<br> - He'd always smack me around<br> - Dad, it's okay. Sit down.<br> You're in the way of the program.<br> Sit down.<br> - Go to hell, you goddamn old vegetable.<br> - You're an animal.<br> - Drop dead!<br> - Sit down. Dad, it's okay. It's okay. Just sit down.<br> This is supposed to remind him<br> of the olden days.<br> Look behind you.<br> - Why are they still showing this?<br> - This is their entertainment.<br> You can't judge it by today's standards.<br> You have to look at it<br> in a historical context.<br> I just thought Dad would like<br> an old movie. Bye. Thanks.<br> Thank you so much. Thanks.<br> Thank God we have that interview tomorrow.<br> Let's just take the stairs.<br> Thank you. Thanks.<br> They're gonna ask you<br> a bunch of questions...<br> and you're really gonna<br> have to concentrate, Dad.<br> - It's important.<br> - Okay.<br> - What's that?<br> - Gingko biloba... boosts brain function.<br> Want some?<br> Dad, open your mouth.<br> Mm.<br> It's like a pharmacy in there.<br> What are those?<br> Antidepressants. You should try some.<br> - I'm not depressed.<br> - Please.<br> You must be the Savages.<br> - Hi. Jon.<br> - Roz. How do you do?<br> - Wendy. Hello.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - Our father.<br> - Nice to meet you. I'm Roz Landis.<br> My name is<br> Leonard Michael Joseph Savage.<br> Okay. Lenny, can you tell me<br> what season we're in?<br> Cold.<br> And the season is?<br> Winter. What do you think?<br> And what is the date today?<br> November.<br> I don't remember the day.<br> Okay.<br> Can you tell me where we are?<br> What city we're in?<br> Put down "East Coast".<br> Boston.<br> - Boston, Mass.<br> - You can't help him, Ms. Savage.<br> - He has to be able to answer the questions himself.<br> - He knows where he is.<br> - Wendy.<br> - What?<br> - She's conducting a test.<br> - I know. I'm not an idiot.<br> Let her ask the goddamn questions!<br> What'd you say to them?<br> I said he was pretty good except<br> he goes in and out every once in a while.<br> "In and out"?<br> Wendy, the mars got dementia.<br> I know, but they only had beds<br> for people who are more independent.<br> I thought if we could<br> just get him in there...<br> Why are you wasting our time<br> on fantasies?<br> She said she would put him<br> on one of the waiting lists.<br> I mean, J... Jesus,<br> I'm just doing it for Dad.<br> Dad's not the one that has<br> a problem with the Valley View.<br> I'm just trying to improve the situation.<br> Is that a crime?<br> There's nothing wrong with Dad's situation.<br> Dad's situation is fine.<br> He's never gonna adjust to it<br> if we keep yanking him out.<br> And actually, this upward mobility<br> fixation of yours...<br> it's counterproductive<br> and, frankly, pretty selfish.<br> - Selfish?<br> - Because it's not about Dad, it's about you and your guilt.<br> That's what these places prey upon.<br> I happen to think it's nicer here.<br> Of course you do, because you are<br> the consumer they want to target.<br> You are the guilty demographic.<br> The landscaping, the neighborhoods of care...<br> They're not for the residents,<br> they're for the relatives...<br> people like you and me who don't want<br> to admit to what's really going on here.<br> - Which is what, Jon?<br> - People are dying, Wendy!<br> Right inside that beautiful building right now,<br> it's a fucking horror show!<br> A... And all this wellness propaganda<br> and the landscaping...<br> It's just there to obscure<br> the miserable fact that people die!<br> And death is gaseous and gruesome...<br> and it's filled with shit<br> and piss and rotten stink!<br> Come on, Nana.<br> There. What do you think?<br> What's it do?<br> - Nothing. It's just something nice to look at.<br> - Oh.<br> - Hey, how you doing, Mr. Savage?<br> - Hi, Jimmy.<br> That's not Jimmy, Dad.<br> What the hell are you talking about?<br> - I'm sorry. He's... he gets a little...<br> - It's okay.<br> It's Howard, Mr. Savage.<br> I'm here to put you to bed.<br> Thursday is Jimmy's night off.<br> Well, then...<br> I better get going, so, good night, Dad.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, Mr. Sperry.<br> - Leave it on.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Worth keep you up?<br> - Yes, I'm sure.<br> Here you go. Good night, Mr. Savage.<br> Good night.<br> Ihr saht den weisen Salomon<br> Ihr wisst, was aus ihm wurde<br> Dem Mann war alles sonnenklar<br> Er verfluchte<br> die Stunde seiner Geburt<br> Und sah da alles eitel war<br> Hey, Wen!<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi, baby. Hello. Where's the beast?<br> - Here.<br> - Oh, hello, beast.<br> Hello!<br> - Did you remember her papers?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Yeah.<br> - How's Marley?<br> - She, you know... she's hanging in there.<br> Her hind legs are really bothering her...<br> but I found this great vet over at the<br> animal hospital... that place on the East Side.<br> They have her in physical therapy.<br> Do you believe it?<br> She's hanging out twice a week<br> in the whirlpool.<br> Get in. Come on. We'll take a ride.<br> I've never been to Buffalo.<br> Let's have some fun! I've missed you!<br> Jon?<br> Jon!<br> - What?<br> - I'm gonna go out for a minute.<br> - Okay.<br> - Um, this is my friend Larry.<br> - This is Jon.<br> - Hi, Jon.<br> - Hi, Larry.<br> - Wendy's told me a lot about you.<br> I loved your essay<br> on Mother Courage, by the way.<br> Wendy showed it to me. I did<br> a production of it. It was a huge help.<br> Okay.<br> - He seems really nice.<br> - Yeah.<br> Is that my ficus?<br> Just sitting down<br> By the riverside<br> Spreading my arms<br> To the open wide<br> Now I'm free<br> and the world's at my feet<br> I can close my eyes<br> Oh, love, keep me warm<br> Keep me satisfied<br> - Sitting by the riverside with you<br> - Come on, come on, come on.<br> Yeah! Yeah, good dog, good d...<br> Come on. Go get it.<br> - Ooh.<br> - Ow!<br> - Oh. Oh.<br> - God!<br> Sorry. I'm sorry.

I mean, come on, Larry.<br> I mean, for Christ's sake,<br> I have an MFA.<br> I mean, look at this.<br> We're in a motel room in Buffalo.<br> - I mean, it's embarrassing. It's a clich!<br> - Shh.<br> - What clich?<br> - The midlife crisis clich.<br> - Whose?<br> - Yours!<br> You are married. You are cheating.<br> You are sleeping with a younger woman.<br> Uh, Wendy...<br> You're-You're not exactly<br> a younger woman.<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> - You're 39.<br> - You're 52.<br> - So?<br> - That makes you older.<br> - Yeah, technically.<br> But this is not exactly the paradigm...<br> of a prototypical winter-spring romance.<br> Annie's 46.<br> I mean, you're not my little student.<br> It's not like we got<br> The Blue Angel going on here.<br> - You know, the professor character in The Blue Angel?<br> - Yeah, Larry, I know the film.<br> Well, yeah, so the poor slob<br> has an affair with his student...<br> and his life is destroyed by it.<br> - Von Stroheim.<br> - Von Sternberg.<br> - Whatever.<br> - Von Sternberg.<br> - You know what I mean. Marlene Dietrich.<br> - It's-<br> She was a nightclub singer.<br> She was not a student.<br> But there... there is... there's a<br> Francine Prose novel by the same name...<br> about a professor-student relationship.<br> - Why do you do this?<br> - What?<br> You do this all the time, and on top of that,<br> you insult me by telling me that I'm the one...<br> that's having a midlife crisis here, when you're<br> the one having an affair with a married guy...<br> instead of seeking real intimacy...<br> with someone who is available<br> for real commitment.<br> And you know, it's all about your father.<br> Oh, hey!<br> Hey.<br> I'm just trying to have<br> a healthy, normal sex life here.<br> Look, I'm not betraying anyone.<br> Only yourself.<br> - What?<br> - Nothing.<br> Wait. Wendy.<br> Wendy.<br> You don't have... Oh, for...<br> Don't do this.<br> Come on, Wen, don't...<br> Hey, do you want me to help? Oh.<br> Are you okay?<br> Look, I'll call you.<br> You double-crosser! You Judas!<br> Harry! Harry, go back!<br> Turn me in.<br> Cut my throat for a thousand quid<br> Go, back, Harry I'll get help<br> Oh, Harry<br> All right, go to Kristo.<br> There you are, Kristol<br> Give her the blood money<br> she cut my throat for.<br> Can we please not use<br> this horrible light?<br> It's depressing.<br> I bought you this one, Dad.<br> Remember?<br> See how nice this is?<br> Wendy?<br> What's... what's going on with that?<br> It's not gonna affect you in any way.<br> They said it was fine for her to stay here<br> as long as I could prove she's had all her shots.<br> I still don't think it's a good idea.<br> Well, they like animals here, Jon.<br> Apparently, it's good<br> for the residents' well-being.<br> They reduce stress, so if you just<br> fucking calm down about it.<br> Hey, hey, hey!<br> Dad?<br> I want to introduce you to someone.<br> - I don't see anything.<br> - Well, here, let me prop you up.<br> - Where's your pillow?<br> - What?<br> - Where's Dad's pillow?<br> - All right, what pillow?<br> The big red one, the one I bought him.<br> The one from Urban Outfitters.<br> You saw it!<br> Jesus, Jon!<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Hold on a second. Yeah.<br> My father has a big red pillow<br> that I bought for him...<br> and it's missing from his room.<br> I just started my shift.<br> Try Simone in the lounge.<br> - Are you Simone?<br> - I am.<br> I'm Lenny Savage's daughter in B-26.<br> He has a big red pillow I bought him.<br> It's missing.<br> - Did he have his name on it?<br> - And his room number.<br> What's it look like?<br> Big... red... pillow.<br> Excuse me. Ma'am?<br> That belongs to my father.<br> The pillow.<br> It doesn't belong to you,<br> it belongs to my father.<br> Huh?<br> I'm so sorry.<br> It doesn't belong to you.<br> No!<br> You all right?<br> Here you go, Dad.<br> Dad, I thought you might like this<br> to help prop you up.<br> Lean forward.<br> There. Dad!<br> - Ah, Wendy, forget it.<br> - I don't want it.<br> Are you sure?<br> It'll make you more comfortable.<br> Come on. Here we go.<br> I don't want it! Can't you hear?<br> What the hell does she think<br> I'm paying her for? To bother me?<br> Wendy, he doesn't know<br> what he's talking about.<br> You want one?<br> Thanks.<br> Thank you.<br> So what's in the box?<br> A cat.<br> Taking it out for a walk?<br> Your cat is cold.<br> Come over here.<br> I'll turn the heat on.<br> How's he doing?<br> My friend in B-26.<br> Oh, he's good.<br> I mean he's not good,<br> but he's... he's okay. He's fine.<br> He likes Tater Tots.<br> It's the only thing he touches sometimes.<br> I give him extras when I can.<br> Double servings.<br> You married?<br> No.<br> But my boyfriend is.<br> Does your mother know<br> you're doing that?<br> She's not really in the picture.<br> She dead? That's why<br> she never comes around, eh?<br> No. Just kind of obsolete<br> in the parenting department.<br> - She just wasn't very good at it.<br> - Hmm.<br> Neither was my father, actually.<br> So that's why a pretty woman doesn't<br> have a husband or a family of her own.<br> What do you do when you're not here?<br> I'm a, um...<br> a theater person.<br> I temp for money, but it's not my main thing.<br> I write plays.<br> Like Shakespeare?<br> Yeah. Well, not as good.<br> - What are your plays about?<br> - What, my plays?<br> - Can I read one?<br> - Are you kidding?<br> - No, no.<br> - You actually want to read one of my plays?<br> What's so strange about that?<br> No, it's just that, you know,<br> in my world...<br> people don't usually want<br> to read somebody's...<br> unproduced play.<br> Your father's doing okay, by the way.<br> He's got some time left.<br> - How do you know?<br> - His toes.<br> They haven't started to curl under yet.<br> The toes, they always curl under<br> a few days before.<br> What, is that some kind of Jamaican<br> folklore thing or something?<br> I learned it from being here.<br> We all talk about it.<br> It's always the same.<br> - The toes curl?<br> - Hmm.<br> Like the witch in The Wizard of Oz.<br> A couple of days before they go.<br> Why, do you think?<br> They say it's the air leaving the body.<br> I'm from Nigeria, by the way.<br> Wendy.<br> Thank you.<br> Jon, it's locked.<br> Come on. Open it.<br> They published the list in the paper,<br> and your name wasn't on it.<br> What?<br> The Guggenheim Foundation took out<br> an ad in the New York Times...<br> announcing their fellows for the year,<br> and your name wasn't on it.<br> - That's weird.<br> - Yeah.<br> Must have been an oversight.<br> Can you... can you let me in?<br> I'm freezing.<br> - It... it wasn't.<br> - What?<br> An oversight.<br> How do you know?<br> Because I called<br> the Guggenheim Foundation.<br> Let me in the car.<br> - Hi, Dad.<br> - Hi.<br> I called them to find out<br> why your name wasn't on the list.<br> - Why would you do that?<br> - 'Cause I was looking out for you.<br> You were policing me.<br> You're sick. That's sick, Jon.<br> No. You're sick.<br> You're the sick one, Wendy.<br> A friend of mine does some consulting<br> for the Guggenheim Foundation.<br> He looked your name up in the computer.<br> You've been rejected eight times.<br> So? How many times<br> have you been rejected?<br> Fuck! That's not the point.<br> - Six.<br> - Hmm, no, no.<br> The point is you don't think<br> I have any talent.<br> The point is you called them<br> because you just couldn't believe...<br> that your little sister might just get one!<br> - Uh, that's not true.<br> - Yeah, yeah, it is true.<br> You're just like him. He never thought<br> I could do anything either.<br> - Why are you comparing me to Dad?<br> - Comparing you to-<br> - What is the point?<br> - No! You don't think I have talent.<br> You just don't think I can do anything.<br> You obviously don't think<br> you can do anything either...<br> because you have to fucking lie about it<br> - Are you out of your mind?<br> - I'm out of my mind?<br> - Where'd you get the money from, Wen?<br> - I got a grant.<br> - Just cut the crap, Wendy.<br> - I got a grant, Jon! I did.<br> Okay, fine,<br> I didn't win a Guggenheim.<br> Big fucking deal.<br> It was a different kind of grant.<br> - What kind?<br> - What?<br> You got a different kind of grant.<br> What'd you get?<br> FEMA.<br> What? I never heard of that.<br> FEMA.<br> FEMA?<br> You mean FEMA,<br> Federal Emergency Management?<br> You took money from FEMA?<br> I was granted the money.<br> What was the federal emergency?<br> What does that have to do with you?<br> I worked downtown. I was affected.<br> Everyone was affected.<br> The whole world was affected.<br> That doesn't mean they're going around<br> taking money from people who really need it.<br> There was no work for months.<br> All the temps... all the temps applied.<br> I was not the first one to-...<br> Look, I... I'm trying<br> to get my life together.<br> - By stealing money from the federal government?<br> - I did not steal it!<br> There's a thing where you can apply...<br> if you lost 25% of your salary<br> or something like that!<br> I don't remember the details.<br> You call FEMA, you ask them.<br> - I'm not.<br> - Look, they care about me more than you do.<br> I'm not calling FEMA.<br> Okay?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Ha, ha.<br> Hello. Yes.<br> No, it's okay. What... what's wrong?<br> Is he all right?<br> What?<br> Okay. Okay, uh, I understand.<br> We'll, uh... we'll be right over.<br> Thank you.<br> - Is he okay?<br> - It's... it's not Dad. It's Genghis.<br> She got in a fight with that other cat.<br> They want us to get her out of there now.<br> I told you that cat was a bad idea.<br> Genghis.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - What happened?<br> - I don't know.<br> They were getting along fine before.<br> She's under here.<br> She won't come out.<br> Genghis.<br> Sometimes, if you just ignore her,<br> she comes.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> I read your play.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> I liked it.<br> - No way. Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> You didn't think it was a bunch<br> of middle-class whining?<br> No.<br> I was scared you'd think<br> I was some spoiled American...<br> who's complaining about<br> her difficult childhood.<br> No, not at all.<br> I thought it was sad.<br> - I should probably go back to work.<br> - Okay, I'm... I am sorry.<br> - No, no, no.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - No, no, no, no, no.<br> - I am so gross.<br> No, you... you're great.<br> - I'm... I am gross.<br> - No, no. No, you're great.<br> It's just... I'm in love<br> with my girlfriend.<br> I... I know it sounds like corn,<br> but, really, I...<br> No.<br> It's not corny.<br> Look who it is.<br> Genghis.<br> Pop the trunk.<br> Here, there's emotion, an interest<br> in what people are feeling.<br> Whereas Brecht wants people to think.<br> In dramatic theater,<br> you have suggestion...<br> but Brecht wants an argument.<br> Excuse me one minute.<br> Hello?<br> Yes, it is.<br> Okay, thank you.<br> Mr. Savage?<br> Um, what's the difference<br> between plot and narrative?<br> Sorry. You wrote it on the board.<br> Jon.<br> Jon.<br> Yeah?<br> That's it?<br> Yeah.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> These are for you.<br> Thank you.<br> Yeah, they don't have a smell.<br> They're from the deli.<br> I never understand why that is<br> with flowers from there.<br> Guess you have to go to a real florist<br> and pay extra if you want the nice smell.<br> Can I come in for a minute?<br> Where's Marley?<br> She's not... uh...<br> I wasn't gonna get into this.<br> Must seem ridiculous compared<br> to what you've been going through.<br> You had a human being die on you.<br> She's dead?<br> We're gonna do it tomorrow.<br> Her hips- she can't get around anymore.<br> She can't get up on the bed.<br> She's so depressed.<br> There's a surgery, but the vet says...<br> there are no guarantees<br> and the rehabilitators brutal.<br> She's old, Wen.<br> She's in pain.<br> I'm sorry about your dad.<br> If you ever want to re-indulge<br> in unhealthy, compromising behavior...<br> you know who to call, right?<br> Larry? Can I ask you a question?<br> Not about us.<br> Go left.<br> Good, do it one more time.<br> No, he doesn't know<br> what's happening.<br> Let's do it again.<br> So walk away<br> and then pace around a little.<br> And, Max, watch TV.<br> What did I tell you<br> about doing your chores before...<br> watching TV, huh?<br> Stop and turn around like it's over.<br> Should I react once he goes up?<br> Do you think it's too much?<br> No, it's, uh...<br> it's, um...<br> the, uh... the naturalism with the...<br> the magic realism together,<br> it-it's effective.<br> Are you crying?<br> Thanks for coming.<br> Thanks for inviting me. I'll, uh...<br> - I'll see the real thing when I come back through.<br> - Okay.<br> Do you hate me for using stuff<br> from your life in the play?<br> No. It's fine.<br> - You don't think it's self-important and bourgeois?<br> - No, it's good.<br> Wendy, it's really good.<br> J FK, please.<br> Wish me luck on my paper.<br> What's it called?<br> "No Laughing Matter:<br> Dark Comedy in the Plays<br> of Berthold Brecht".<br> - Bad title?<br> - No, it's good. It's good.<br> No, I like it.<br> - Where's the conference?<br> - Poland.<br> You didn't tell me that.<br> You didn't ask.<br> Just gonna check in with-you know.<br> Play it by ear, see how we...<br> feel about each other's people and...<br> It's really good.<br> Okay.<br> Come on, baby. Come on.<br> Let's go.<br> I'm sticking with you<br> 'Cause I'm made out of glue<br> Anything that you might do<br> I'm gonna do, too<br> You held up a stagecoach in the rain<br> And I'm doing the same<br> Saw you hanging from a tree<br> And I made-believe it was me<br> I'm sticking with you<br> 'Cause I'm made out of glue<br> Anything that you might do<br> I'm gonna do, too<br> Moon people going<br> to the stratosphere<br> Soldiers fighting with the Cong<br> But with you by my side,<br> I can do anything<br> When we swing<br> We hang past right and wrong<br> I'll do anything for you<br> Anything you want me to<br> I'll do anything for you<br> Oh-oh, I'm sticking with you<br> Oh-oh, I'm sticking with you<br> Oh-oh, I'm sticking with you<br> Oh-oh, I'm sticking with you<br> Oh-oh, I'm sticking with you<br> Oh-oh, I'm sticking with you<br> Oh-oh, I'm sticking with you<br> Oh-oh, I'm sticking with you<br> Oh-oh, I'm sticking with you<br> Oh-oh<br>
