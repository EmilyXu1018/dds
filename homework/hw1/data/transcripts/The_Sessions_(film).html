It's just a question of depth<br> of penetration for most people.<br> Like my partner, for instance.<br> It doesn't really matter to me.<br> I mean, I get just as excited<br> when he licks my nipples.<br> When he bothers to do that.<br> (TAPE RECORDER CLICKS)<br> I think your tape's run out.<br> Oh.<br> Oh.<br> Do you want to continue?<br> Uh...<br> MARK:<br> That's okay, Carmen.<br> I think I've actually<br> got enough to work on.<br> Thanks.<br> Well, give me a call if you need anything.<br> Let me get you Greg's number. He's full of<br> things you wouldn't believe were possible.<br> Oral sex is a matter of taste.<br> And one thing that really works<br> in my favor...<br> ...is that I smoke so much weed...<br> ...that my taste buds are pretty jaded.<br> This gives me a great deal of stamina<br> in the tongue department.<br> And stamina is key in cunnilingus.<br> (MEOWS)<br> Who are these people?<br> I feel like an anthropologist<br> interviewing a tribe of headhunters.<br> (BELL TOLLING)<br> Hi.<br> It's good to see you. How are things?<br> Well...<br> Sorry.<br> Things are a little confusing<br> at the moment.<br> I would appreciate your advice as a friend,<br> if you know what I mean.<br> Sure. And I understand what you mean.<br> You remember at one point<br> you suggested I might see a therapist?<br> Yes.<br> Well...<br> ...one way or another, it's a long story,<br> I ended up seeing a therapist.<br> A particular sort of therapist.<br> A sex therapist.<br> (PHONE RINGS)<br> WOMAN: Good morning, UC Berkeley.<br> May I please speak to someone...<br> ...in the Center for Sexuality<br> and Disability, please?<br> I'm sorry, sir. The Center for Sexuality<br> and Disability has been shut down.<br> Thank God.<br> Sir?<br> I'm sorry to have bothered you.<br> It's no bother.<br> Oh, sir, before you go,<br> I can give you a phone number...<br> ...for one of the therapists<br> who used to work there.<br> Would you like that?<br> MARK: It's not gonna fit.<br> MAN: It's fine.<br> We got you. Everything's just fine.<br> MARK: I don't like this. Let's forget it.<br> Do you want to see this woman or not?<br> No!<br> Oops. Too late.<br> What floor?<br> Eighteenth floor.<br> Oh...<br> So...<br> ...what sort of chance<br> do you give me?<br> Of achieving your romantic fantasy?<br> Very small to minute.<br> Oh, look, you don't have to pull any<br> punches. You can be direct with me.<br> Mark, I'm just a humble sex therapist.<br> I try to help people with sex problems<br> that can be addressed.<br> Your problem, I understand,<br> is that you've never had sex.<br> That's correct.<br> Would I be correct in assuming<br> you're unable to masturbate?<br> Correct.<br> Has anyone done it for you?<br> No.<br> Have you ever asked anyone?<br> Not specifically.<br> I asked someone to marry me once.<br> She declined.<br> Does that come close to masturbation?<br> You know,<br> being with the person you love...<br> ...is not the only way<br> of expressing yourself sexually.<br> There are people called sex surrogates.<br> Oh?<br> My penis speaks to me, Father Brendan.<br> Sometimes I ejaculate during<br> a bed bath in front of my attendants.<br> All I feel is shame and mortification while<br> other men apparently get pleasure. I...<br> I'm sorry if I sound angry.<br> Don't worry about it. Go on.<br> This therapist...<br> ...suggested I could work<br> with a sexual specialist.<br> Have sex with a person<br> known as a sex surrogate...<br> ...who would be sensitive<br> to my unusual needs.<br> I've been giving it some thought.<br> Hold... Hold on.<br> What do you mean, "have sex"?<br> Well, when a man and a woman...<br> ...love each other very much...<br> No, I understand what it...<br> Are we talking about sexual intercourse?<br> I think so.<br> Outside marriage?<br> I did do my best<br> on the question of marriage.<br> What's the difference<br> between this sexual specialist...<br> ...and a common prostitute?<br> I don't know,<br> but I think there's a difference.<br> How old are you?<br> Thirty-eight.<br> Why exactly now?<br> I never had any cash before,<br> that's a major factor.<br> And I'm probably getting close<br> to my use-by date.<br> And this is what you wanted<br> my advice on? Fornication.<br> Your advice as a friend.<br> Do I have the deciding vote, so to speak?<br> Well, let's just say I value your advice<br> just as much as I do the therapist's.<br> You're serious about this?<br> I think sex is a serious matter.<br> It's one of the most persistent themes<br> in the Bible.<br> So...<br> ...is it possible for me<br> to know a woman...<br> ...in the Biblical sense, so to speak?<br> And...<br> And do I want to find out?<br> You want my opinion?<br> Please.<br> In my heart, I feel like he'll give you<br> a free pass on this one.<br> Go for it.<br> Huh?<br> Go for it.<br> Really?<br> Yes.<br> If you feel up to it. Do you feel up to it?<br> To tell you the truth...<br> ...I'm scared.<br> Well, then, we should pray.<br> Sweet Jesus...<br> ...Mark and I sit at your feet...<br> ...and pray that you bless<br> this little journey.<br> This one small step for a man.<br> I really feel proud of myself.<br> Imposing on someone I hardly know<br> to fornicate in their home.<br> Get over it.<br> It's perfectly normal.<br> Ta-da!<br> Wow.<br> There are all sorts of useful things<br> in that drawer over there...<br> ...if you guys feel like exploring.<br> Oh, that's okay.<br> I'll bring my own sheets and towels.<br> No, everything will be provided.<br> I'm really honored that you asked me.<br> It'll be great karma for the house.<br> Great karma for the house?<br> My God, the pressure already.<br> I can't stand it.<br> (PHONE RINGING)<br> Hey.

Thank you.<br> That was the wrong way to start off.<br> It really was. Shall we start again?<br> Please. You start.<br> Although the aim is for us to have sex...<br> ...I'm not a prostitute.<br> You don't have to pay me up front.<br> I have nothing against prostitutes,<br> but there's a difference.<br> We can talk about that later.<br> I'm sorry.<br> The other thing is, there's a limit<br> to the number of sessions we can have.<br> Did Laura mention that<br> when you saw her?<br> I'm sorry. I don't remember.<br> The limit is six, but that gives us<br> plenty of opportunity to explore.<br> Six.<br> So I understand<br> you're able to have an erection.<br> Yes, but not by choice.<br> Do you know how many men there are who<br> would give anything for a natural erection?<br> Is this your place?<br> No, it's a friend's.<br> The only bedroom furniture<br> I have at my place is an iron lung.<br> I've been wondering maybe<br> about possibly buying a futon...<br> ...you know, in case the need arose.<br> It might be worth thinking about.<br> I've got the space, I think.<br> It can be expensive, though, a nice...<br> Futon, I mean. How much do you think<br> a good one would cost?<br> Because I never...<br> Mark, take a deep breath.<br> Yeah.<br> And let go.<br> (EXHALES)<br> Do I seem anxious?<br> You do a little.<br> So Laura tells me you're a poet.<br> What's it like to be a poet?<br> It's a way of living inside your own head,<br> which is where I spend most of my time.<br> But not today.<br> Nice shirt, by the way.<br> Thank you.<br> So I'm gonna ask you<br> some basic questions, okay?<br> Sure. Explain to me, so<br> that I really understand...<br> ...exactly what the iron lung is for.<br> It keeps me breathing.<br> I can spend a few hours outside of it<br> with my portable respirator...<br> ...depending on how I feel...<br> ...but I work and sleep in the iron lung.<br> And how do you feel right now?<br> Out of my league.<br> (CHUCKLES)<br> I meant your breathing.<br> Oh, fine.<br> In fact, better than usual.<br> That's great.<br> Shall we get undressed?<br> Sure.<br> So it's good for me...<br> Be careful.<br> Did that hurt?<br> Not yet.<br> Do you have any areas<br> of unusual sensitivity?<br> Any parts of your body<br> you don't want me to touch?<br> I have normal sensitivity all over.<br> I'm not paralyzed exactly.<br> It's just my muscles don't work too good.<br> But you could touch me anywhere.<br> That's great.<br> Ow! Ow!<br> Stop! It hurts! It hurts! Holy Mother of God.<br> What...? What's wrong?<br> Ahh! My fingers are caught.<br> It's okay. It's okay.<br> I've got it. I've got you. Don't worry.<br> Be careful, please.<br> Mark, I'm gonna be really careful<br> with you.<br> I don't want to hurt you or injure you<br> in any way.<br> And it's really not sexy when<br> you yell at me. Okay?<br> I won't yell at you any more.<br> But you'll tell me, calmly...<br> ...the minute something starts to hurt.<br> Yes.<br> Okay.<br> Here we go.<br> Piece of cake. Heh.<br> Nice shirt.<br> You already said that.<br> Did I?<br> Okay.<br> I'm gonna slide these down.<br> Be careful with my feet, okay? My feet.<br> Be careful.<br> Hold your breath.<br> Okay. Whoa. There you go.<br> Careful. Not so fast.<br> (WATER RUNNING)<br> You ready?<br> Whoa.<br> I'm gonna take that as a yes.<br> So the difference between me<br> and a prostitute...<br> ...is a prostitute<br> wants your return business.<br> I don't.<br> I'm here to help you<br> learn about your sexual feelings...<br> ...so you can share them<br> with a future partner.<br> Mark, I want you to tell me how it feels each<br> time I touch a different part of your body.<br> Okay?<br> You know, whenever I'm naked...<br> ...everyone else in the room<br> is always dressed.<br> Now that I'm in bed with<br> another naked person, it's very confusing.<br> Why is it confusing?<br> I'd always expected that God<br> or my parents would intervene...<br> ...to keep this moment from ever happening.<br> Not this time.<br> So if something feels good,<br> you tell me.<br> If something is ticklish or bothers you,<br> I want you to let me know.<br> I don't want you to tolerate anything.<br> Okay.<br> I'm gonna start with the top<br> of your head.<br> You have soft hair.<br> It's really nice to touch.<br> Does it feel good?<br> It does.<br> That feels weird.<br> Weird good or weird bad?<br> Just weird.<br> That's good.<br> Still good?<br> Everything good so far except the ear.<br> Are these the body awareness<br> exercises?<br> You're very clever to have worked that out.<br> People tell me I'm very perceptive.<br> Mark, would you like to<br> see what I feel like?<br> Sure.<br> You touch one, you have to touch the other.<br> It's sort of a rule.<br> That's a good rule.<br> Are you wearing cologne?<br> Yes.<br> I like it.<br> I don't usually like cologne,<br> but I like that.<br> So, Mark, I'm gonna move my hand<br> along your body...<br> ...down to your penis, and<br> if you feel me... Ooh!<br> (MOANS)<br> Oh.<br> Nice job.<br> I thought there would be more to it.<br> Not that it was unpleasant.<br> After all, I was in bed with a naked woman.<br> She complimented me on my shirt,<br> my hair.<br> She held my penis.<br> I haven't even seen my penis<br> for over 30 years.<br> Am I sharing too much, Father?<br> No, no. I'm used to it.<br> So next week.<br> Friday the 20th, same time?<br> That's good for me.<br> Next time, we'll start to work<br> on intercourse.<br> Were you afraid at the thought of seeing me?<br> Oh, God, I was terrified.<br> You should be proud of yourself.<br> You did great. We've made real progress.<br> Can I ask you something?<br> Sure. What would you like to ask?<br> Anything, really.<br> Just tell me something about yourself.<br> Anything.<br> Okay.<br> Um... I'm a very private person.<br> I have a private life.<br> I need you to be aware of that.<br> But that's about it.<br> This therapy's about you.<br> VERA: Hello.<br> Welcome back.<br> CHERYL: Perfect timing.<br> I hope you guys kept the noise down.<br> See you then.<br> What was it like?<br> How do you feel?<br> Cleansed and victorious.<br> Doesn't get any better than that.<br> How about your first time?<br> Oh, let me think.<br> What was it like?<br> It wasn't all that pleasant.<br> Oh.<br> I mean, it was consensual<br> and everything...<br> ...and I was in love with the guy,<br> but his dick seemed enormous to me.<br> I didn't think it would fit.<br> It was scary.<br> He was nice. I guess he couldn't help it.<br> Was he Chinese?<br> Are you kidding me?<br> I only dated white guys in high school.<br> Why is that?<br> Stick it to my mom and dad,<br> I suppose.<br> Are they happy now<br> you have a Chinese boyfriend?<br> They're happy. I'm happy.<br> What's his dick like?<br> Perfect size.<br> Why do you call it a<br> dick instead of a penis?<br> Dick...<br> Penis sounds like some vegetable<br> you don't want to eat.<br> Heh, heh.<br> Dick sounds like what it is.<br> The thing is...<br> ...it was all over so damn quickly.<br> Yeah, tell me about it.<br> First session.<br> Mark O'Brien is the oldest<br> of four children...<br> ...and raised Catholic.<br> He was extremely nervous.<br> He yelled a lot when I took off his shirt,<br> but I think more out of fear than pain.<br> He cannot masturbate, has had<br> only the occasional kissing experience.<br> He's capable of achieving an erection easily,<br> but the unusual curvature of his body...<br> ...could be a serious<br> obstacle to intercourse.<br> I just started working with this gentleman<br> who spends almost his entire life...<br> ...trapped in a big metal box.<br> Did you hear what I said?<br> Yes. Yes.<br> And you are a saint.<br> "Sometimes the head of the penis<br> may be too large...<br> ...to penetrate the vaginal opening<br> smoothly...<br> ...in which case the application<br> of lubricant is recommended...<br> ...to avoid possible..."<br> Oh, my God.<br> So, what's on the menu<br> for today?<br> We're attempting intercourse.<br> Heh.

Oh, God.<br> Damn.<br> Shit.<br> I did it again.<br> This time, I ejaculated on her thigh.<br> I felt cursed.<br> That the whole enterprise was cursed.<br> It seemed like a totally just punishment.<br> God wasn't actually denying<br> my sexuality.<br> He was just pointing out to me<br> how useless it was.<br> It's amazing to me how often God<br> is brought into the sex act.<br> I understand even among nonbelievers...<br> ...the most common expression<br> of sexual ecstasy is, "Oh, God." Heh.<br> (CLEARS THROAT)<br> Okay, I don't want to hear<br> any more about God cursing you.<br> I want the credit. It was<br> my overpowering beauty that did it.<br> It took you by surprise.<br> Now, where were we?<br> What do you mean, "Where were we?"<br> I'm gonna touch you.<br> I'm touching you.<br> Okay.<br> And when we both feel you're aroused...<br> ...like now,<br> I'm gonna guide you inside me.<br> Is there anything I need to do?<br> Just close your eyes...<br> ...and feel your body.<br> That's all you need to do.<br> It won't fit.

It's too risky.<br> Mark, Mark, stop.<br> Stop.<br> I promise you nothing bad<br> will happen.<br> Let's try again<br> while you're still hard.<br> Shit!
