                        Mr. Dufresne, describe...<br> ...the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.<br> It was very bitter.<br> She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.<br> And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.<br> - What was your response?<br> - I told her I would not grant one.<br> "I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."<br> Those were your words,according to your neighbors.<br> If they say so.<br> I really don't remember.<br> I was upset.<br> What happened after you argued with your wife?<br> She packed a bag.<br> She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.<br> Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...<br> ...whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.<br> Did you follow her?<br> I went to a few bars first.<br> Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.<br> I parked in the turnout...<br> ...and waited.<br> With what intention?<br> I'm not sure.<br> I was confused...<br> ...drunk.<br> I think...<br> ...mostly I wanted to scare them.<br> When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.<br> I was sobering up.<br> I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.<br> Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.<br> I've been very clear on this point.<br> I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...<br> ...and finds your wife in bed with her lover...<br> ...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.<br> Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?<br> Yes, it does.<br> Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...<br> ...before the murders took place.<br> That's very convenient.<br> It's the truth.<br> The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...<br> ...so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets...<br> ...taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.<br> And that also...<br> ...is very convenient.<br> Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?<br> Since I am innocent of this crime...<br> ...I find it decidedly inconvenient<br> that the gun was never found.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard<br> all the evidence.<br> We have the accused at the scene<br> of the crime. We have footprints.<br> Bullets on the ground<br> bearing his fingerprints.<br> A broken bourbon bottle,<br> likewise with fingerprints.<br> And most of all...<br> ...we have a beautiful young woman<br> and her lover...<br> ...lying dead in each other's arms.<br> They had sinned.<br> But was their crime so great...<br> ...as to merit a death sentence?<br> While you think about that...<br> ...think about this:<br> A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.<br> I submit that this was not<br> a hot-blooded crime of passion.<br> That at least could be understood,<br> if not condoned.<br> No.<br> This was revenge...<br> ...of a much more brutal,<br> cold-blooded nature. Consider this:<br> Four bullets per victim.<br> Not six shots fired, but eight.<br> That means that he fired<br> the gun empty...<br> ...and then stopped to reload...<br> ...so that he could shoot<br> each of them again.<br> An extra bullet per lover...<br> ...right in the head.<br> You strike me as a particularly icy<br> and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.<br> It chills my blood just to look at you.<br> By the power vested in me<br> by the state of Maine...<br> ...I hereby order you to serve<br> two life sentences back-to-back...<br> ...one for each of your victims.<br> So be it!<br> Sit.<br> We see you've served<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - You feel you've been rehabilitated?<br> Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.<br> I mean, I learned my lesson.<br> I can honestly say<br> that I'm a changed man.<br> I'm no longer a danger to society.<br> That's God's honest truth.<br> Hey, Red.<br> How'd it go?<br> Same old shit, different day.<br> Yeah, I know how you feel.<br> I'm up for rejection next week.<br> Yeah, I got rejected last week.<br> It happens.<br> Hey, Red, bump me a deck.<br> Get out of my face, man!<br> You're into me for five packs already.<br> Four!<br> There must be a con like me<br> in every prison in America.<br> I'm the guy who can get it for you.<br> Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,<br> if that's your thing...<br> ...bottle of brandy to celebrate<br> your kid's high school graduation.<br> Damn near anything within reason.<br> Yes, sir!<br> I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.<br> So when Andy Dufresne<br> came to me in 1949...<br> ...and asked me to smuggle<br> Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...<br> ...I told him, "No problem."<br> Andy came to Shawshank Prison...<br> ...in early 1947 for murdering his wife<br> and the fella she was banging.<br> On the outside, he'd been vice president<br> of a large Portland bank.<br> Good work for a man so young.<br> You speak English, butt-steak?<br> You follow this officer.<br> I never seen such a sorry-looking<br> heap of maggot shit in all my life.<br> Hey, fish! Come over here!<br> Taking bets today, Red?<br> Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.<br> Smokes. Put me down for two.<br> All right, who's your horse?<br> That little sack of shit.<br> - Eighth. He'll be first.<br> - Bullshit! I'll take that action.<br> You're out some smokes, son.<br> If you're so smart, you call it.<br> I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.<br> The fifth one.<br> Put me down for a quarter deck.<br> Fresh fish today!<br> We're reeling them in!<br> I admit I didn't think much of Andy<br> first time I laid eyes on him.<br> Looked like a stiff breeze<br> would blow him over.<br> That was my first impression of the man.<br> What do you say?<br> That tall drink of water<br> with the silver spoon up his ass.<br> That guy? Never happen.<br> -10 cigarettes.<br> - That's a rich bet.<br> Who's going to prove me wrong?<br> Heywood? Jigger?<br> Skeets?<br> Floyd!<br> Four brave souls.<br> Return to your cellblocks<br> for evening count.<br> All prisoners,<br> return to your cellblocks.<br> Turn to the right!<br> Eyes front.<br> This is Mr. Hadley.<br> He's captain of the guards.<br> I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.<br> You are convicted felons.<br> That's why they've sent you to me.<br> Rule number one:<br> No blasphemy.<br> I'll not have the Lord's name<br> taken in vain in my prison.<br> The other rules...<br> ...you'll figure out as you go along.<br> Any questions?<br> When do we eat?<br> You eat when we say you eat.<br> You shit when we say you shit,<br> and piss when we say you piss.<br> You got that,<br> you maggot-dick motherfucker?<br> On your feet.<br> I believe in two things:<br> Discipline and the Bible.<br> Here, you'll receive both.<br> Put your trust in the Lord.<br> Your ass belongs to me.<br> Welcome to Shawshank.<br> Unhook them.<br> Turn around.<br> That's enough.<br> Move to the end of the cage.<br> Turn around. Delouse him.<br> Turn around.<br> Move out of the cage.<br> Pick up your clothes and Bible.<br> Next man up!<br> To the right.<br> Right. Right.<br> Left.<br> The first night's the toughest.<br> No doubt about it.<br> They march you in<br> naked as the day you were born...<br> ...skin burning and half-blind<br> from that delousing shit.<br> And when they put you in that cell...<br> ...and those bars slam home...<br> ...that's when you know it's for real.<br> Old life blown away<br> in the blink of an eye.<br> Nothing left but all the time<br> in the world to think about it.<br> Most new fish come close to madness<br> the first night.<br> Somebody always breaks down crying.<br> Happens every time.<br> The only question is...<br> ...who's it going to be?<br> It's as good a thing<br> to bet on as any, I guess.<br> I had my money on Andy Dufresne.<br> Lights out!<br> I remember my first night.<br> Seems like a long time ago.<br> Hey, fish.<br> Fish, fish.<br> What are you, scared of the dark?<br> Bet you wish your daddy<br> never dicked your mama!<br> Piggy! Pork!<br> I want me a pork chop.<br> The boys always go fishing<br> with first-timers.<br> And they don't quit<br> till they reel someone in.<br> Hey, Fat Ass.<br> Fat Ass!<br> Talk to me, boy.<br> I know you're there.<br> I can hear you breathing.<br> Don't you listen to these nitwits,<br> you hear me?<br> This place ain't so bad.<br> Tell you what...<br> ...I'll introduce you around,<br> make you feel right at home.<br> I know a couple of<br> big old bull queers that'd just...<br> ...love to make your acquaintance.<br> Especially that big, white,<br> mushy butt of yours.<br> God!<br> I don't belong here!<br> - We have a winner!<br> - I want to go home!<br> And it's Fat Ass by a nose!<br> Fresh fish!<br> I want to go home!<br> I want my mother!<br> I had your mother!<br> She wasn't that great!<br> What the Christ is this horseshit?<br> He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.<br> You'll tell him<br> with my baton up your ass!<br> Let me out!<br> What is your malfunction,<br> you fat barrel of monkey spunk?<br> Please! I ain't supposed to be here.<br> Not me!<br> I won't count to three.<br> Not even to one.<br> You shut up,<br> or I'll sing you a lullaby!<br> Shut up, man. Shut up!<br> You don't understand.<br> I'm not supposed to be here.<br> Open that cell.<br> Me neither! They run this place<br> like a fucking prison!<br> Son of a bitch!<br> Captain, take it easy!<br> If I hear so much as a mouse fart<br> in here tonight...<br> ...I swear by God and Jesus,<br> you will all visit the infirmary.<br> Every last motherfucker in here.<br> Call the trustees. Take that<br> tub of shit down to the infirmary.<br> His first night in the joint, Dufresne<br> cost me two packs of cigarettes.<br> He never made a sound.<br> Tier 3 north, clear count!<br> Tier 2 north, clear count.<br> Tier 3 south, clear.<br> Prepare to roll out.<br> Roll out!<br> Are you going to eat that?<br> I hadn't planned on it.<br> Do you mind?<br> That's nice and ripe.<br> Jake says thank you.<br> Fell out of his nest<br> over by the plate shop.<br> I'm going to look after him<br> until he's big enough to fly.<br> Oh, no! Here he comes.<br> Morning, fellas.<br> Fine morning, isn't it?<br> You know why it's a fine morning,<br> don't you?<br> Send them down.<br> I want them lined up...<br> ...just like a pretty little<br> chorus line.<br> Look at that.<br> - I can't stand this guy.<br> - Oh, Lord!<br> Yes! Richmond, Virginia.<br> Smell my ass!<br> After he smells mine.<br> That's a shame about your horse<br> coming in last and all.<br> But I sure do love<br> that winning horse of mine, though.<br> I owe that boy a big kiss<br> when I see him.<br> Why don't you give him some of your<br> cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!<br> Hey, Tyrell.<br> You pull infirmary duty this week?<br> How's my horse doing anyway?<br> Dead.<br> Hadley busted his head up pretty good.<br> Doc had gone home for the night.<br> Poor bastard lay there<br> till this morning.<br> By then, there wasn't nothing<br> we could do.<br> What was his name?<br> What'd you say?<br> I was just wondering<br> if anyone knew his name.<br> What the fuck do you care, new fish?<br> Doesn't fucking matter<br> what his name was. He's dead.<br> Anybody come at you yet?<br> Anybody get to you yet?<br> Hey, we all need friends in here.<br> I could be a friend to you.<br> Hard to get.<br> I like that.<br> Andy kept pretty much<br> to himself at first.<br> I guess he had a lot on his mind...<br> ...trying to adapt<br> to life on the inside.<br> Wasn't until a month went by<br> before he opened his mouth...<br> ...to say more than two words<br> to somebody.<br> As it turned out...<br> ...that somebody was me.<br> I'm Andy Dufresne.<br> Wife-killing banker.<br> Why'd you do it?<br> I didn't, since you ask.<br> You're going to fit right in.<br> Everybody in here's innocent.<br> Didn't you know that?<br> - What you in here for?<br> - Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.<br> Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.<br> You think your shit smells<br> sweeter than most. Is that right?<br> What do you think?<br> To tell you the truth,<br> I haven't made up my mind.<br> I understand you're a man<br> that knows how to get things.<br> I'm known to locate certain things<br> from time to time.<br> I wonder if you might get me<br> a rock hammer.<br> A rock hammer.<br> - What is it and why?<br> - What do you care?<br> For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.<br> I'd quote a price.<br> But a toothbrush<br> is a non-lethal object, isn't it?<br> Fair enough.<br> A rock hammer is about<br> six or seven inches long.<br> - Looks like a miniature pickax.<br> - Pickax?<br> For rocks.<br> Quartz?<br> And some mica, shale...<br> ...limestone.<br> So?<br> So I'm a rock hound.<br> At least I was in my old life.<br> I'd like to be again.<br> Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy<br> into somebody's skull.<br> No, I have no enemies here.<br> No? Wait a while.<br> Word gets around.<br> The Sisters have taken<br> quite a liking to you.<br> Especially Bogs.<br> Don't suppose it would help if I<br> told them I'm not homosexual.<br> Neither are they.<br> You have to be human first.<br> They don't qualify.<br> Bull queers take by force.<br> That's all they want or understand.<br> If I were you, I'd grow eyes<br> in the back of my head.<br> - Thanks for the advice.<br> - Well, that's free.<br> You understand my concern.<br> If there's trouble,<br> I won't use the rock hammer.<br> Then I'd guess you want to escape.<br> Tunnel under the wall, maybe.<br> What did I miss?<br> What's so funny?<br> You'll understand<br> when you see the rock hammer.<br> What's an item like this usually go for?<br> Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.<br> My normal markup's 20 percent.<br> But this is a specialty item.<br> Risk goes up, price goes up.<br> Let's make it an even 10 bucks.<br> Ten it is.<br> Waste of money, if you ask me.<br> Why's that?<br> Folks around this joint<br> love surprise inspections.<br> They find it, you're going to lose it.<br> If they catch you, you don't know me.<br> Mention my name, we never<br> do business again.<br> Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.<br> Now you got that?<br> I understand.<br> Thank you, Mr...<br> Red.<br> Name's Red.<br> Why do they call you that?<br> Maybe it's because I'm Irish.<br> I could see why some of the boys<br> took him for snobby.<br> He had a quiet way about him...<br> ...a walk and a talk that just<br> wasn't normal around here.<br> He strolled...<br> ...like a man in the park without a care<br> or a worry in the world.<br> Like he had on an invisible coat<br> that would shield him from this place.<br> I think it'd be fair to say...<br> ...I liked Andy from the start.<br> Let's go! Some of us<br> got a schedule to keep.<br> Move it! Come on, move it!<br> How you doing?<br> How's the wife treating you?<br> Andy was right.<br> I finally got the joke.<br> It would take a man about 600 years...<br> ...to tunnel under the wall<br> with one of these.<br> - Book?<br> - Not today.<br> Book?<br> Delivery for Dufresne.<br> Here's your book.<br> Thanks.<br> We're running low on hexite.<br> Get on back and fetch us up some.<br> This will blind you.<br> Honey, hush.<br> That's it. You fight!<br> Better that way.<br> I wish I could tell you<br> Andy fought the good fight...<br> ...and the Sisters let him be.<br> I wish I could tell you that...<br> ...but prison is no fairy-tale world.<br> He never said who did it.<br> But we all knew.<br> Things went on like that for a while.<br> Prison life consists of routine...<br> ...and then more routine.<br> Every so often, Andy would show up<br> with fresh bruises.<br> The Sisters kept at him.<br> Sometimes he was able<br> to fight them off.<br> Sometimes not.<br> And that's how it went for Andy.<br> That was his routine.<br> I do believe those first two years<br> were the worst for him.<br> And I also believe that<br> if things had gone on that way...<br> ...this place would have<br> got the best of him.<br> But then, in the spring of 1949...<br> ...the powers that be decided:<br> The roof of the license-plate factory<br> needs resurfacing.<br> I need a dozen volunteers<br> for a week's work.<br> As you know...<br> ...special detail carries with it<br> special privileges.<br> It was outdoor detail...<br> ...and May is one damned fine month<br> to be working outdoors.<br> Stay in line there.<br> More than a hundred men<br> volunteered for the job.<br> Wallace E. Unger.<br> Ellis Redding.<br> Wouldn't you know it?<br> Me and some fellows I know<br> were among the names called.<br> Andrew Dufresne.<br> It only cost us<br> a pack of smokes per man.<br> I made my usual 20 percent, of course.<br> So this big-shot lawyer<br> calls me long-distance from Texas.<br> I say, "Yeah?"<br> He says, "Sorry to inform you,<br> but your brother just died."<br> - I'm sorry to hear that.<br> - I'm not. He was an asshole.<br> Ran off years ago.<br> Figured him for dead.<br> So this lawyer fellow says to me:<br> "He died a rich man." Oil wells<br> and shit. Close to a million bucks.<br> A million bucks?<br> - Incredible how lucky some assholes get.<br> - You going to see any of that?<br> Thirty-five thousand.<br> That's what he left me.<br> Dollars?<br> That's great! That's like<br> winning the sweepstakes.<br> Isn't it?<br> Dumb shit, what do you think<br> the government will do to me?<br> Take a big wet bite<br> out of my ass is what.<br> Poor Byron.<br> Terrible fucking luck, huh?<br> Crying shame.<br> Some people really got it awful.<br> Andy, are you nuts?<br> Keep your eyes on your mop, man!<br> You'll pay some tax,<br> but you'll still end up-<br> Yeah, maybe enough to buy<br> a new car, and then what?<br> I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...<br> ...maintenance, kids pestering you<br> to take them for a ride all the time.<br> Then if you figure your tax wrong,<br> you pay out of your own pocket.<br> I tell you! Uncle Sam!<br> He puts his hand in your shirt<br> and squeezes your tit till it's purple.<br> - Getting himself killed.<br> - Keep tarring.<br> Some brother.<br> Shit!<br> Mr. Hadley...<br> ...do you trust your wife?<br> Oh, that's funny.<br> You'll look funnier<br> sucking my dick with no teeth.<br> What I mean is, do you think<br> she'd go behind your back?<br> Step aside, Mert. This fucker's<br> having himself an accident.<br> He'll push him off!<br> If you trust her, you can keep...<br> ...that 35,000.<br> - What did you say?<br> - Thirty-five thousand.<br> All of it.<br> - Every penny.<br> - You better start making sense.<br> If you want to keep it,<br> give it to your wife.<br> The IRS allows a one-time-only gift<br> to your spouse for up to $60,000.<br> - Bullshit. Tax-free?<br> - Tax-free.<br> IRS can't touch one cent.<br> You're that smart banker<br> that killed his wife.<br> Why should I believe you?<br> So I can end up in here with you?<br> It's legal. Ask the IRS.<br> They'll say the same thing.<br> I feel stupid telling you this.<br> I'm sure you would have investigated.<br> I don't need you to tell me<br> where the bear shit in the buckwheat.<br> Of course not. But you do need<br> someone to set it up for you.<br> That'll cost you. A lawyer.<br> A bunch of ball-washing bastards!<br> I suppose I could set it up for you.<br> That would save you some money.<br> You get the forms, I'll prepare them...<br> ...nearly free of charge.<br> I'd only ask three beers apiece<br> for each of my coworkers.<br> "Coworkers." That's rich!<br> A man working outdoors<br> feels more like a man...<br> ...if he can have a bottle of suds.<br> That's only my opinion...<br> ...sir.<br> What are you jimmies staring at?<br> Let's go! Work!<br> And that's how it came to pass...<br> ...that on the second-to-last<br> day of the job...<br> ...the convict crew that tarred<br> the factory roof in the spring of '49...<br> ...wound up sitting in a row<br> at 10:00 in the morning...<br> ...drinking icy-cold beer,<br> courtesy of the hardest screw...<br> ...that ever walked a turn<br> at Shawshank State Prison.<br> Drink up while it's cold, ladies.<br> The colossal prick even managed<br> to sound magnanimous.<br> We sat and drank with the sun<br> on our shoulders and felt like free men.<br> We could have been tarring<br> the roof of one of our own houses.<br> We were the lords of all creation.<br> As for Andy...<br> ...he spent that break<br> hunkered in the shade...<br> ...a strange little smile on his face...<br> ...watching us drink his beer.<br> Want a cold one?<br> No, thanks. I gave up drinking.<br> You could argue he done it<br> to curry favor with the guards.<br> Or maybe make a few friends<br> among us cons.<br> Me?<br> I think he did it<br> just to feel normal again...<br> ...if only for a short while.<br> King me.<br> - Chess. Now there's a game of kings.<br> - What?<br> Civilized. Strategic.<br> And a total fucking mystery.<br> I hate it.<br> Let me teach you someday.<br> Sure.<br> We could get a board together.<br> You're talking to the right man.<br> I can get things, right?<br> We might do business on a board,<br> and I'll carve the pieces myself.<br> One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.<br> What do you think?<br> I think it'll take years.<br> Years I got.<br> What I don't have are the rocks.<br> Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.<br> Pebbles, mostly.<br> We're getting to be<br> kind of friends, aren't we?<br> Yeah, I guess.<br> Can I ask you something?<br> Why'd you do it?<br> I'm innocent, Red.<br> Just like everybody else here.<br> What are you in for?<br> Murder. Same as you.<br> Innocent?<br> Only guilty man in Shawshank.<br> Where's the canary?<br> How did you know?<br> - How did I know what?<br> - So you don't know.<br> Come.<br> This is where the canary is.<br> Quite a surprise to hear<br> a woman singing in my house, eh?<br> That's quite a...<br> ...surprise.<br> Wait, wait.<br> Here she comes.<br> I like this part when she<br> does that shit with her hair.<br> I know. I've seen it<br> three times this month.<br> Gilda, are you decent?<br> Me?<br> God, I love it.<br> I understand you're a man<br> that knows how to get things.<br> I'm known to locate certain things<br> from time to time. What do you want?<br> - Rita Hayworth.<br> - What?<br> Can you get her?<br> So this is Johnny Farrel.<br> I've heard a lot about you.<br> - Take a few weeks.<br> - Weeks?<br> I don't have her stuffed down the front<br> of my pants right now, sorry to say.<br> But I'll get her.<br> Relax.<br> Thanks.<br> - Get out!<br> - I got to change reels!<br> I said fuck off!<br> Ain't you going to scream?<br> Let's get this over with.<br> He broke my fucking nose!<br> Now...<br> ...I'm going to open my fly...<br> ...and you'll swallow<br> what I give you to swallow.<br> Then you'll swallow Rooster's.<br> You broke his nose.<br> He ought to have<br> something to show for it.<br> You put it in my mouth,<br> you lose it.<br> No, you don't understand.<br> Do that and I'll put all eight inches<br> of this in your ear.<br> All right, but you should know<br> that sudden, serious brain injury...<br> ...causes the victim to bite down hard.<br> In fact, I hear the bite reflex<br> is so strong...<br> ...they have to pry<br> the victim's jaws open...<br> ...with a crowbar.<br> Where do you get this shit?<br> I read it.<br> You know how to read,<br> you ignorant fuck?<br> Honey!<br> You shouldn't!<br> Bogs didn't put anything<br> in Andy's mouth.<br> And neither did his friends.<br> What they did do is beat him<br> within an inch of his life.<br> Andy spent a month in the infirmary.<br> Bogs spent a week in the hole.<br> Time's up, Bogs.<br> It's your world, boss.<br> Return to your cellblocks<br> for evening count.<br> All prisoners report for lock down.<br> What?<br> - Where's he going?<br> - Grab his ankles.<br> Help!<br> Two things never happened again<br> after that.<br> The Sisters never<br> laid a finger on Andy again.<br> And Bogs would never walk again.<br> They transferred him<br> to a minimum-security hospital upstate.<br> To my knowledge, he lived out<br> the rest of his days...<br> ...drinking his food through a straw.<br> Andy could use a nice welcome back<br> when he gets out of the infirmary.<br> Sounds good to us.<br> I figure we owe him that much<br> for the beer.<br> The man likes to play chess.<br> Let's get him some rocks.<br> Guys!<br> I got one.<br> I got one. Look!<br> Heywood, that isn't soapstone!<br> And it ain't alabaster either.<br> What are you, a fucking geologist?<br> He's right. It ain't.<br> - What the hell is it then?<br> - It's a horse apple.<br> - Bullshit!<br> - No, horseshit.<br> Petrified.<br> Damn!<br> Despite a few hitches,<br> the boys came through in fine style.<br> And by the weekend<br> he was due back...<br> ...we had enough rocks saved up<br> to keep him busy till rapture.<br> Also got a big shipment in that week.<br> Cigarettes...<br> ...chewing gum...<br> ...sipping whisky...<br> ...playing cards with naked ladies<br> on them. You name it.<br> And of course, the most important item:<br> Rita Hayworth herself.<br> Heads up.<br> They're tossing cells.<br> Heads up.<br> They're tossing cells!<br> On your feet.<br> Face the wall.<br> Turn around and face the warden.<br> Pleased to see you reading this.<br> Any favorite passages?<br> "Watch ye, therefore,<br> for ye know not...<br> ...when the master<br> of the house cometh."<br> Mark 13:35.<br> I've always liked that one.<br> But I prefer...<br> ..."I am the light of the world.<br> Ye that followeth me<br> shall have the light of life."<br> John, chapter 8, verse 12.<br> I hear you're good with numbers.<br> How nice.<br> Man should have a skill.<br> Explain this.<br> It's called a rock blanket.<br> It's for shaping and polishing rocks.<br> A little hobby of mine.<br> It's pretty clean.<br> Some contraband here,<br> but nothing to get in a twist over.<br> I can't say I approve of this.<br> But I suppose...<br> ...exceptions can be made.<br> Lock them up!<br> I almost forgot.<br> I'd hate to deprive you of this.<br> Salvation lies within.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Tossing cells was just an excuse.<br> Truth is...<br> ...Norton wanted to size Andy up.<br> My wife made that in church group.<br> Very nice, sir.<br> You enjoy working the laundry?<br> No, sir. Not especially.<br> Perhaps we can find something more...<br> ...befitting a man of your education.<br> Hey, Jake.<br> Where's Brooks?<br> I thought I heard you out here.<br> I've been reassigned to you.<br> I know, they told me.<br> Ain't that a kick in the head?<br> Well, I'll give you the dime tour.<br> Come on.<br> Well, here she is.<br> The Shawshank Prison Library.<br> National Geographics...<br> ...Reader's Digest condensed books...<br> ...and Louis L'Amour.<br> Look magazine.<br> Erle Stanley Gardners.<br> Every evening I load up the cart<br> and make my rounds.<br> I enter the names<br> on this clipboard here.<br> Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.<br> - Any questions?<br> - How long have you been librarian?<br> I come here in '05,<br> and they made me librarian in 1912.<br> And have you ever had an assistant?<br> No. Not much to it, really.<br> Why me? Why now?<br> I don't know.<br> But it'd be nice to have<br> some company down here.<br> That's him.<br> That's the one.<br> I'm Dekins.<br> I was thinking...<br> ...about setting up some kind of<br> trust fund for my kids' educations.<br> I see.<br> Why don't we have a seat<br> and talk it over.<br> Do you have a piece of paper<br> and a pencil?<br> Thanks.<br> So...<br> Mister Dekins...<br> And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...<br> ...do you want your sons<br> to go to Harvard or Yale?"<br> He didn't say that!<br> As God as my witness!<br> Dekins blinked for a second...<br> ...then he laughed<br> and actually shook Andy's hand.<br> - My ass!<br> - Shook his hand.<br> I tell you, I near soiled myself!<br> All he needed was a suit and tie<br> and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...<br> ...he'd have been<br> "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.<br> Making a few friends?<br> I wouldn't say "friends."<br> I'm a convicted murderer<br> who provides sound financial planning.<br> It's a wonderful pet to have.<br> Got you out of the laundry, though.<br> It might do more than that.<br> How about expanding the library.<br> Get some new books.<br> If you ask for something,<br> ask for a pool table.<br> How do you expect to do that?<br> I mean...<br> ...get new books in here,<br> "Mr. Dufresne, if you please."<br> I'll ask the warden for funds.<br> Six wardens have been through here<br> in my tenure, and I've learned...<br> ...one immutable, universal truth:<br> Not one born whose asshole...<br> ...wouldn't pucker up tighter than<br> a snare drum when you ask for funds.<br> - The budget's stretched thin as it is.<br> - I see.<br> Maybe I could write the state senate<br> and request funds from them.<br> They have only three ways to spend<br> the taxpayers' money for prisons:<br> More walls, more bars, more guards.<br> I'd like to try, with permission.<br> A letter a week.<br> - They can't ignore me forever.<br> - Sure can.<br> But you write your letters<br> if it makes you happy.<br> I'll even mail them for you.<br> How's that?<br> So Andy started writing<br> a letter a week...<br> ...just like he said.<br> And like Norton said...<br> ...Andy got no answers.<br> The following April, he did tax returns<br> for half the guards at Shawshank.<br> Year after that, he did them all...<br> ...including the warden's.<br> Year after that, they<br> rescheduled the intramural season...<br> ...to coincide with tax season.<br> The guards on the opposing teams<br> all remembered to bring their W-2s.<br> So Moresby Prison...<br> ...issued you a gun,<br> but you paid for it.<br> Right. The holster too.<br> That's tax-deductible.<br> You can write that off.<br> Yes, sir!<br> Andy was a regular cottage industry.<br> In fact, it got so busy at tax time,<br> he was allowed a staff.<br> Could you hand me<br> a stack of 1040s?<br> Got me out of the wood shop a month out<br> of the year, and that was fine by me.<br> And still, he kept<br> sending those letters.<br> It's Brooks.<br> Watch the door.<br> Please, Brooks.<br> - Calm the fuck down.<br> - Stay back!<br> - Stay back, goddamn it!<br> - What's going on?<br> One second he's fine,<br> then out come the knives.<br> We can talk about this, right?<br> There's nothing to talk about.<br> I'll cut his fucking throat.<br> What's he done to you?<br> It's what they done!<br> I got no choice.<br> You won't hurt Heywood.<br> We all know that.<br> - Right, Heywood?<br> - Sure.<br> He's a friend of yours,<br> and Brooks is a reasonable man.<br> Right, guys?<br> So put the knife down.<br> Look at me.<br> Put the knife down.<br> Look at his neck, for God's sake.<br> Look at his neck. He's bleeding.<br> It's the only way...<br> ...they'd let me stay.<br> This is crazy.<br> You don't want to do this.<br> Put it, put it down.<br> Take it easy.<br> You'll be all right.<br> Him? What about me?<br> Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!<br> You've had worse from shaving.<br> What did you do to set him off?<br> Nothing.<br> I come in here to say farewell.<br> Ain't you heard?<br> His parole's come through.<br> I just don't understand<br> what happened in there.<br> Old man's crazy as a rat<br> in a tin shithouse.<br> That's enough out of you.<br> - Heard he had you shitting your pants.<br> - Fuck you.<br> Knock it off.<br> Brooks ain't no bug.<br> He's just institutionalized.<br> "Institutionalized," my ass.<br> The man's been in here 50 years,<br> Heywood, 50 years!<br> This is all he knows.<br> In here, he's an important man...<br> ...an educated man.<br> Outside, he's nothing.<br> Just a used-up con<br> with arthritis in both hands.<br> Probably couldn't get a library card<br> if he tried.<br> You know what I'm trying to say?<br> I do believe<br> you're talking out of your ass.<br> You believe whatever you want.<br> But I tell you these walls are funny.<br> First you hate them.<br> Then you get used to them.<br> Enough time passes...<br> ...you get so you depend on them.<br> That's "institutionalized."<br> Shit.<br> - I could never get like that.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> Wait till you've been here<br> as long as Brooks.<br> Goddamn right.<br> They send you here for life...<br> ...that's exactly what they take.<br> Part that counts, anyway.<br> I can't take care of you no more, Jake.<br> You go on now.<br> You're free.<br> You're free.<br> Good luck, Brooksie.<br> Dear fellas:<br> I can't believe how fast things move<br> on the outside.<br> Watch it, old-timer!<br> Want to get killed?<br> I saw an automobile once<br> when I was a kid...<br> ...but now they're everywhere.<br> The world went and got itself<br> in a big damn hurry.<br> The parole board<br> got me into this halfway house...<br> ...called "The Brewer"...<br> ...and a job...<br> ...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.<br> It's hard work and I try to keep up...<br> ...but my hands hurt most of the time.<br> Make sure your man double-bags.<br> Last time, the bottom near came out.<br> Make sure you double-bag<br> like the lady says. Understand?<br> Yes, sir. Surely will.<br> I don't think the store manager<br> likes me very much.<br> Sometimes after work,<br> I go to the park and feed the birds.<br> I keep thinking...<br> ...Jake might just show up<br> and say hello.<br> But he never does.<br> I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay<br> and making new friends.<br> I have trouble sleeping at night.<br> I have bad dreams like I'm falling.<br> I wake up scared.<br> Sometimes it takes me a while<br> to remember where I am.<br> Maybe I should get a gun and rob<br> the Food-Way so they'd send me home.<br> I could shoot the manager while<br> I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.<br> I guess I'm too old<br> for that sort of nonsense anymore.<br> I don't like it here.<br> I'm tired of being afraid all the time.<br> I've decided...<br> ...not to stay.<br> I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...<br> ...not for an old crook like me.<br> "I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,<br> not for an old crook like me.<br> P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry<br> I put a knife to his throat.<br> No hard feelings. Brooks."<br> He should have died in here.<br> What the fuck have you done?<br> It's a goddamn mess,<br> I'll tell you that.<br> - What's all this?<br> - You tell me. They're addressed to you.<br> Take it.<br> "Dear Mr. Dufresne:<br> In response to your inquiries...<br> ...the state has allocated the enclosed<br> funds for your library project."<br> This is $200.<br> "In addition, the library district<br> has generously responded...<br> ...with a donation of used books<br> and sundries.<br> We trust this will fill your needs.<br> We now consider the matter closed.<br> Please stop sending us letters."<br> Clear all this out<br> before the warden gets back.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Good for you, Andy.<br> Wow!<br> It only took six years.<br> From now on, I'll write two<br> letters a week instead of one.<br> I believe you're crazy enough.<br> Get this stuff out...<br> ...like he said.<br> I've got to pinch a loaf.<br> When I come back...<br> ...this is all gone, all right?<br> Do you hear that?<br> Dufresne!<br> Andy, let me out!<br> I have no idea to this day what those<br> two Italian ladies were singing about.<br> Truth is, I don't want to know.<br> Some things are best left unsaid.<br> I like to think it was something<br> so beautiful...<br> ...it can't be expressed in words...<br> ...and makes your heart ache<br> because of it.<br> I tell you, those voices soared...<br> ...higher and farther than anybody<br> in a gray place dares to dream.<br> It was like a beautiful bird<br> flapped into our drab cage...<br> ...and made those walls dissolve away.<br> And for the briefest of moments...<br> ...every last man at Shawshank<br> felt free.<br> It pissed the warden off<br> something awful.<br> Open the door.<br> Open it up!<br> Dufresne, open this door!<br> Turn that off!<br> I am warning you. Turn that off!<br> You're mine now.<br> Andy got two weeks in the hole<br> for that little stunt.<br> On your feet.<br> - Hey, look who's here.<br> - Maestro!<br> You couldn't play something good, huh?<br> Like Hank Williams?<br> They broke the door down<br> before I could take requests.<br> - Was it worth two weeks?<br> - Easiest time I ever did.<br> - No such thing as easy time in the hole.<br> - A week in the hole is like a year.<br> - Damn straight.<br> - I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.<br> So they let you tote<br> that record player down there, huh?<br> It was in here.<br> In here.<br> That's the beauty of music. They...<br> ...can't get that from you.<br> Haven't you ever felt<br> that way about music?<br> Well, I played a mean harmonica<br> as a younger man.<br> Lost interest in it, though.<br> Didn't make much sense in here.<br> Here's where it makes the most sense.<br> You need it so you don't forget.<br> Forget?<br> Forget that there are...<br> ...places...<br> ...in the world<br> that aren't made out of stone.<br> There's something...<br> ...inside...<br> ...that they can't get to...<br> ...that they can't touch.<br> That's yours.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Hope.<br> Hope.<br> Let me tell you something, my friend.<br> Hope is a dangerous thing.<br> Hope can drive a man insane.<br> It's got no use on the inside.<br> You'd better get used to that idea.<br> Like Brooks did?<br> Sit down.<br> Says here that you've served<br> You feel you've been rehabilitated?<br> Oh, yes, sir.<br> Without a doubt.<br> I can honestly say I'm a changed man.<br> No danger to society here.<br> God's honest truth.<br> Absolutely rehabilitated.<br> Thirty years.<br> Jesus, when you say it like that...<br> You wonder where it went.<br> I wonder where 10 years went.<br> Here.<br> A little parole rejection present.<br> Go ahead and open it.<br> Went through one of your competitors.<br> I hope you don't mind.<br> I wanted it to be a surprise.<br> It's very pretty.<br> Thank you.<br> You going to play it?<br> No.<br> Not right now.<br> Roll in!<br> Lights out!<br> Andy was as good as his word.<br> He wrote two letters a week<br> instead of one.<br> In 1959, the state senate<br> finally clued in to the fact...<br> ...they couldn't buy him off<br> with just a $200 check.<br> Appropriations Committee<br> voted an annual payment of $500...<br> ...just to shut him up.<br> And you'd be amazed how far<br> Andy could stretch it.<br> He made deals with book clubs,<br> charity groups.<br> He bought remaindered books<br> by the pound...<br> Treasure Island.<br> Robert Louis-<br> Stevenson.<br> Fiction, adventure.<br> What's next?<br> I got here Auto Repair...<br> ...and Soap Carving.<br> Trade skills and hobbies.<br> Under "Educational," behind you.<br> Count of Monte Crisco.<br> That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.<br> By Alexandree...<br> ...Dum-ass.<br> Dumb ass.<br> Dumb ass?<br> Dumas. Know what that's about?<br> You'd like it.<br> It's about a prison break.<br> We ought to file that<br> under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?<br> The rest of us did our best<br> to pitch in when and where we could.<br> By the year Kennedy was shot...<br> ...Andy had transformed a storage room<br> smelling of turpentine...<br> ...into the best prison library<br> in New England...<br> ...complete with a fine selection<br> of Hank Williams.<br> That was also when Warden Norton...<br> ...instituted his famous<br> "Inside Out" program.<br> You may remember reading about it.<br> It made the papers<br> and got his picture in Look magazine.<br> It's no free ride...<br> .. but rather a genuine<br> progressive advance...<br> ...in corrections and rehabilitation.<br> Our inmates, properly supervised...<br> ...will be put to work<br> outside these walls...<br> ...performing all manner<br> of public service.<br> These men can learn the value...<br> ...of an honest day's labor and<br> provide a service to the community...<br> ...at a bare minimum of expense<br> to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.<br> Of course he didn't tell the press...<br> ...that "bare minimum of expense"<br> is a fairly loose term.<br> There are 100 different ways<br> to skim off the top.<br> Men, materials, you name it.<br> And oh, my Lord,<br> how the money rolled in!<br> At this rate,<br> you'll put me out of business.<br> With this pool of slave labor,<br> you can underbid any contractor in town.<br> We're providing<br> a valuable community service.<br> That's fine for the papers,<br> but I've got a family to feed.<br> We go back a long way.<br> I need this highway contract.

That's<br> the other thing. He never shut up.<br> Places he'd been in...<br> ...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.<br> Even people he killed.<br> People who "gave him shit."<br> That's how he put it.<br> So one night, like a joke...<br> ...I say to him,<br> "Elmo, who did you kill?"<br> So he says:<br> I got me this job one time,<br> busing tables at a country club...<br> ...so I could case all these big<br> rich pricks that come in.<br> So I pick out this guy...<br> ...go in one night...<br> ...and do his place.<br> He wakes up...<br> ...and gives me shit.<br> So I killed him.<br> Him and this tasty bitch he was with.<br> And that's the best part.<br> She's fucking this prick, see...<br> ...this golf pro,<br> but she's married to some other guy.<br> Some hotshot banker.<br> And he's the one they pinned it on.<br> I have to say that's<br> the most amazing story I ever heard.<br> What amazes me most<br> is you'd be taken in by it.<br> Sir?<br> It's obvious this fellow Williams<br> is impressed with you.<br> He hears your tale of woe<br> and naturally wants to cheer you up.<br> He's young, not terribly bright.<br> It's not surprising he wouldn't<br> know what a state he put you in.<br> Sir, he's telling the truth.<br> Let's say for the moment<br> this Blatch does exist.<br> You think he'd just fall to his knees<br> and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.<br> By the way,<br> add a life term to my sentence."<br> With Tommy's testimony,<br> I can get a new trial.<br> That's assuming Blatch is still there.<br> Chances are, he'd be released by now.<br> They'd have his last known address.<br> It's a chance, isn't it?<br> How can you be so obtuse?<br> What?<br> What did you call me?<br> Obtuse. Is it deliberate?<br> You're forgetting yourself.<br> The country club<br> will have his old timecards.<br> Records, W-2s with his name on them.<br> If you want to indulge this fantasy,<br> it's your business.<br> Don't make it mine.<br> This meeting is over.<br> If I got out, I'd never mention<br> what happens here.<br> I'd be as indictable as you<br> for laundering that money.<br> Don't ever mention money to me,<br> you son of a bitch!<br> Not in this office...<br> ...not anywhere.<br> Get in here, now!<br> I just wanted to put you at ease,<br> that's all.<br> Solitary.

Anything.<br> There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.<br> You know where Buxton is?<br> - A lot of hayfields up there.<br> - One in particular.<br> It's got a long rock wall<br> with a big oak tree at the north end.<br> It's like something<br> out of a Robert Frost poem.<br> It's where I asked my wife to marry me.<br> We went there for a picnic...<br> ...and made love under that oak...<br> ...and I asked and she said yes.<br> Promise me, Red.<br> If you ever get out...<br> ...find that spot.<br> At the base of that wall, there's a rock<br> that has no earthly business in Maine.<br> Piece of black, volcanic glass.<br> Something's buried under it<br> I want you to have.<br> What, Andy?<br> What's buried under there?<br> You'll have to pry it up...<br> ...to see.<br> No, I'm telling you.

You're holding up the show!<br> Don't make me come down<br> or I'll thump your skull for you!<br> Damn it, you're putting me behind!<br> I got a schedule to keep.<br> You'd better be sick or dead in there.<br> I shit you not!<br> You hear me?<br> Oh, my Holy God.<br> I want every man<br> on this cellblock questioned.<br> - Start with that friend of his.<br> - Who?<br> Open 237.<br> What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?<br> Don't say that to me.<br> Don't tell me that again.<br> But sir, he wasn't.<br> I can see that, Haig!<br> Think I'm blind?<br> Is that what you're saying?<br> - Am I blind, Haig?<br> - No, sir!<br> What about you. You blind?<br> - Tell me what this is.<br> - Last night's count.<br> You see Dufresne's name there?<br> I sure do. Right there.<br> "Dufresne."<br> He was in his cell...<br> ...at lights out.<br> Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.<br> I want him found.<br> Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Let's go. Move your butts.<br> Stand.<br> Well?<br> Well, what?<br> I see you two all the time.<br> You're thick as thieves, you are.<br> He must have said something.<br> No, sir, Warden.<br> Not a word.<br> Lord, it's a miracle!<br> Man vanished like a fart in the wind.<br> Nothing left...<br> ...but some damn rocks<br> on a windowsill.<br> And that cupcake on the wall.<br> Let's ask her.<br> Maybe she knows.<br> What say there, fuzzy-britches?<br> Feel like talking?<br> Guess not.<br> Why should she be any different?<br> This is a conspiracy.<br> That's what this is.<br> One big, damn conspiracy!<br> And everyone's in on it!<br> Including her!<br> In 1966...<br> ...Andy Dufresne escaped...<br> ...from Shawshank Prison.<br> All they found<br> was a muddy set of prison clothes...<br> ...a bar of soap...<br> ...and an old rock hammer...<br> ...damn near worn down to the nub.<br> I had thought it'd take a man 600 years<br> to tunnel through the wall with it.<br> Old Andy did it in less than 20.<br> Oh, Andy loved geology.<br> I imagine it appealed to his<br> meticulous nature.<br> An ice age here...<br> ...million years<br> of mountain building there.<br> Geology is the study<br> of pressure and time.<br> That's all it takes, really.<br> Pressure...<br> ...and time.<br> That and a big goddamn poster.<br> Like I said...<br> ...in prison, a man will do anything<br> to keep his mind occupied.<br> Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting<br> his wall out into the exercise yard...<br> ...a handful at a time.<br> I guess after Tommy was killed...<br> ...Andy decided<br> he'd been here long enough.<br> Lickety-split.<br> I want to get home.<br> I'm just about finished, sir.<br> Three deposits tonight.<br> Andy did like he was told.<br> Buffed those shoes<br> to a high mirror-shine.<br> The guards simply didn't notice.<br> Neither did I.<br> I mean, seriously...<br> ...how often do you really look<br> at a man's shoes?<br> Andy crawled to freedom<br> through 500 yards...<br> ...of shit-smelling foulness<br> I can't even imagine.<br> Or maybe I just don't want to.<br> Five hundred yards.<br> That's the length<br> of five football fields.<br> Just shy of half a mile.<br> The next morning, right about the time<br> Raquel was spilling her secret...<br> ...a man nobody ever<br> laid eyes on before...<br> ...strolled into<br> the Maine National Bank.<br> Until that moment,<br> he didn't exist.<br> - Except on paper.<br> - May I help you?<br> He had all the proper ID...<br> ...driver's license, birth certificate,<br> Social Security card...<br> And the signature<br> was a spot-on match.<br> I must say I'm sorry<br> to be losing your business.<br> I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm sure I will.<br> Here's your cashier's check, sir.<br> Will there be anything else?<br> Please.<br> Would you add this<br> to your outgoing mail?<br> I'd be happy to.<br> Good day, sir.<br> Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks<br> in the Portland area that morning.<br> All told, he blew town...<br> ...with better than $370,000<br> of Warden Norton's money.<br> Severance pay for 19 years.<br> Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.<br> Byron Hadley?<br> You have the right to remain silent.<br> If you give up this right, anything you<br> say can be held against you in court.<br> I wasn't there to see, but I hear<br> Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...<br> ...when they took him away.<br> Norton had no intention<br> of going that quietly.<br> Samuel Norton.<br> We have a warrant<br> for your arrest. Open up.<br> Open the door.<br> I'm not sure which key.<br> Make it easy on yourself, Norton!<br> I like to think the last thing<br> that went through his head...<br> ...other than that bullet...<br> ...was to wonder how the hell<br> Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.<br> Not long after the warden<br> deprived us of his company...<br> ...I got a postcard in the mail.<br> It was blank,<br> but the postmark said...<br> ...Fort Hancock, Texas.<br> Fort Hancock...<br> ...right on the border.<br> That's where Andy crossed.<br> When I picture him heading south<br> in his own car with the top down...<br> ...it always makes me laugh.<br> Andy Dufresne...<br> ...who crawled through<br> a river of shit...<br> ...and came out clean<br> on the other side.<br> Andy Dufresne...<br> ...headed for the Pacific.<br> Hadley's got him<br> by the throat, right?<br> He says, "I believe this boy's<br> about to have himself an accident."<br> Those of us who knew him best<br> talk about him often.<br> I swear, the stuff he pulled...<br> "My friends could use<br> a couple of beers."<br> And he got it!<br> Sometimes it makes me sad, though...<br> ...Andy being gone.<br> I have to remind myself that<br> some birds aren't meant to be caged.<br> Their feathers are just too bright.<br> And when they fly away...<br> ...the part of you that knows it was<br> a sin to lock them up does rejoice.<br> But still...<br> ...the place you live in is that much<br> more drab and empty that they're gone.<br> I guess I just miss my friend.<br> Please sit down.<br> Ellis Boyd Redding...<br> ...your files say you've served<br> You feel you've been rehabilitated?<br> Rehabilitated?<br> Well, now, let me see.<br> I don't have any idea<br> what that means.<br> It means you're ready<br> to rejoin society-<br> I know what you think it means, sonny.<br> To me it's just a made-up word.<br> A politician's word so that...<br> ...young fellas like yourself<br> can wear a suit and a tie...<br> ...and have a job.<br> What do you really want to know?<br> Am I sorry for what I did?<br> Well, are you?<br> There's not a day goes by<br> I don't feel regret.<br> Not because I'm in here<br> or because you think I should.<br> I look back on the way I was then...<br> ...a young...<br> ...stupid kid who committed<br> that terrible crime.<br> I want to talk to him.<br> I want to try<br> and talk some sense to him.<br> Tell him the way things are.<br> But I can't.<br> That kid's long gone...<br> ...and this old man is all that's left.<br> I got to live with that.<br> Rehabilitated?<br> It's just a bullshit word.<br> So you go on and stamp your forms,<br> sonny, and stop wasting my time.<br> Because to tell you the truth...<br> ...I don't give a shit.<br> Here you go, miss.<br> Restroom break?<br> You don't need to ask me every time<br> you need to go take a piss. Just go.<br> Forty years I've been asking<br> permission to piss.<br> I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.<br> There's a harsh truth to face.<br> No way I'm going to make it<br> on the outside.<br> All I do anymore is think of ways<br> to break my parole...<br> ...so maybe they'd send me back.<br> Terrible thing, to live in fear.<br> Brooks Hatlen knew it.<br> Knew it all too well.<br> All I want is to be back<br> where things make sense.<br> Where I won't have to be afraid<br> all the time.<br> Only one thing stops me.<br> A promise I made to Andy.<br> There it is.<br> Much obliged, sir.<br> Dear Red:<br> If you're reading this,<br> you've gotten out...<br> ...and if you've come this far,<br> maybe you'd come a bit further.<br> You remember the name<br> of the town, don't you?<br> Zihuatanejo.<br> I could use a good man<br> to help me get my project on wheels.<br> I'll keep an eye out for you,<br> and the chessboard ready.<br> Remember, Red...<br> ...hope is a good thing...<br> ...maybe the best of things.<br> And no good thing ever dies.<br> I will be hoping<br> that this letter finds you...<br> ...and finds you well.<br> Your friend...<br> ...Andy.<br> "Get busy living...<br> ...or get busy dying."<br> That's goddamn right.<br> For the second time in my life...<br> ...I'm guilty of committing a crime.<br> Parole violation.<br> Of course I doubt they'll toss up<br> any roadblocks for that.<br> Not for an old crook like me.<br> Fort Hancock, Texas, please.<br> I find I'm so excited I can barely<br> sit still or hold a thought in my head.<br> I think it's the excitement<br> only a free man can feel.<br> A free man at the start<br> of a long journey...<br> ...whose conclusion is uncertain.<br> I hope I can make it across the border.<br> I hope to see my friend<br> and shake his hand.<br> I hope the Pacific is as blue<br> as it has been in my dreams.<br> I hope.<br>
