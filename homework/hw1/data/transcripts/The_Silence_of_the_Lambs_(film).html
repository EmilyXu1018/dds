                        WOODS NEAR QUANTICO, VA<br> Starling!<br> Starling!<br> Crawford wants to see you in his office.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - Clarice.<br> - Hey.<br> You looking for Crawford? He should<br> be back in a minute. Wait in his office.<br> Starling.<br> - Clarice M. Good morning.<br> - Morning, Mr Crawford.<br> Sorry to pull you off the course<br> at such short notice.<br> Your instructors tell me you're doing well.<br> I hope so. They haven't<br> posted any grades yet.<br> A job's come up and I thought about you.<br> Not a job, really. More of<br> an interesting errand. Sit down.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I remember you from my seminar at UVA.<br> You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,<br> on the Bureau's civil rights record<br> in the Hoover years. I gave you an A.<br> A-minus, sir.<br> Double major: psych and criminology.<br> Graduated magna.<br> Summer internships<br> at the Reitzinger Clinic.<br> It says, when you graduate, you wanna<br> work for me in Behavioral Science.<br> Yes, very much, sir. Very much.<br> We're interviewing all serial killers now in<br> custody for a psycho-behavioral profile.<br> Could be a real help in unsolved cases.<br> Most of them have been<br> happy to talk to us.<br> - Do you spook easily, Starling?<br> - Not yet, sir.<br> See, the one we want most<br> refuses to cooperate.<br> I want you to go after him<br> again today in the asylum.<br> - Who's the subject?<br> - The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.<br> Hannibal the Cannibal.<br> I don't expect him to talk to you.<br> But I have to be able to say we tried.<br> So if he won't cooperate,<br> I want just straight reporting.<br> How does he look? How does<br> his cell look? Is he sketching, drawing?<br> If he is, what's he sketching?<br> Here's a dossier on Lecter.<br> A copy of our questionnaire<br> and a special ID for you.<br> Have your memo on my desk<br> by 0800 Wednesday.<br> OK.<br> Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?<br> Lecter's been in prison for so many years.<br> Is there some connection<br> between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?<br> I wish there were.<br> Now, I want your full attention, Starling.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.<br> Dr Chilton at the asylum will go over all<br> the physical procedures used with him.<br> Do not deviate from them<br> for any reason whatsoever.<br> And you're to tell him nothing personal.<br> Believe me, you don't want<br> Hannibal Lecter inside your head.<br> Just do your job,<br> but never forget what he is.<br> And what is that?<br> Oh, he's a monster. A pure psychopath.<br> So rare to capture one alive.<br> From a research point of view,<br> Lecter is our most prized asset.<br> We get a lot of detectives here, but<br> I can't ever remember one as attractive.<br> Will you be in Baltimore overnight?<br> Because this can be quite a fun town<br> if you have the right guide.<br> I'm sure this is a great town, Dr Chilton,<br> but my instructions are to talk to Dr Lecter<br> and report back this afternoon.<br> I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.<br> We've tried to study him, but he's much<br> too sophisticated for the standard tests.<br> Oh, my, does he hate us!<br> He thinks I'm his nemesis.<br> Crawford's very clever,<br> isn't he, using you?<br> - What do you mean, sir?<br> - A pretty, young woman to turn him on.<br> I don't believe Lecter's<br> seen a woman in eight years.<br> And are you ever his taste! So to speak.<br> I graduated from UVA, Doctor.<br> It's not a charm school.<br> Good. Then you should<br> be able to remember the rules.<br> Do not touch or approach the glass.<br> You pass him nothing but soft paper.<br> No pencils or pens.<br> No staples or paperclips in his paper.<br> Use the sliding food carrier. If he attempts<br> to pass you anything, do not accept it.<br> - Do you understand me?<br> - Yes, I understand, sir.<br> I'm going to show you<br> why we insist on such precautions.<br> On July 8, 1981, he complained of chest<br> pains and was taken to the dispensary.<br> His restraints were removed for an EKG.<br> When the nurse leaned over him,<br> he did this to her.<br> The doctors managed to reset her jaw,<br> more or less, save one of her eyes.<br> His pulse never got above 85,<br> even when he ate her tongue.<br> - I keep him in here.<br> - Dr Chilton.<br> If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,<br> then maybe we'll have more luck<br> if I go in by myself. What do you think?<br> You might have suggested this<br> in my office and saved me the time.<br> Yes, sir, but then I would have missed<br> the pleasure of your company, sir.<br> When she's finished, bring her out.<br> Hi, I'm Barney. He told you,<br> don't get near the glass?<br> Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.<br> Nice to meet you, Clarice. You can<br> hang your coat up there if you like.<br> Thank you. I will.<br> He's past the others, the last cell.<br> You keep to the right.<br> - I put out a chair for you.<br> - That's very good. Thank you.<br> I'll be watchin'. You'll do fine.<br> Hi.<br> I can smell your cunt!<br> - Good morning.<br> - Dr Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.<br> May I speak with you?<br> You're one of Jack Crawford's,<br> aren't you?<br> - I am, yes.<br> - May I see your credentials?<br> Certainly.<br> Closer, please.<br> Closer.<br> That expires in one week.<br> You're not real FBI, are you?<br> I'm still in training at the academy.<br> Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?<br> Yes, I'm a student.<br> I'm here to learn from you.<br> Maybe you can decide whether or not<br> I'm qualified enough to do that.<br> That is rather slippery of you,<br> Agent Starling.<br> Sit, please.<br> Now then, tell me.<br> What did Miggs say to you?<br> Multiple Miggs in the next cell.<br> He hissed at you. What did he say?<br> He said "I can smell your cunt."<br> I see.<br> I myself cannot.<br> You use Evyan skin cream.<br> And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.<br> But not today.<br> Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?<br> That is the Duomo<br> seen from the Belvedere.<br> - Do you know Florence?<br> - All that detail just from memory, sir?<br> Memory, Agent Starling,<br> is what I have instead of a view.<br> Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us<br> your view on this questionnaire, sir.<br> Oh, no, no, no, no.<br> You were doing fine. You had been<br> courteous and receptive to courtesy.<br> You had established trust, with<br> the embarrassing truth about Miggs.<br> And now this ham-handed segue<br> into your questionnaire.<br> - It won't do.<br> - I'm only asking you to look at this.<br> Either you will or you won't.<br> Yeah. Jack Crawford<br> must be very busy indeed<br> if he's recruiting help<br> from the student body.<br> Busy hunting that new one: Buffalo Bill.<br> What a naughty boy he is.<br> Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?<br> Please tell me.<br> The newspapers won't say.<br> It started as a bad joke<br> in Kansas City Homicide.<br> They said<br> "This one likes to skin his humps."<br> Why do you think he removes<br> their skins, Agent Starling?<br> Thrill me with your acumen.<br> It ex cites him. Most serial killers keep<br> some sort of trophies from their victims.<br> - I didn't.<br> - No. No, you ate yours.<br> You send that through now.<br> Oh, Agent Starling, you think you can<br> dissect me with this blunt little tool?<br> No. I thought that your knowledge...<br> You're so ambitious, aren't you?<br> Do you know what you look like, with<br> your good bag and your cheap shoes?<br> You look like a rube.<br> A well-scrubbed, hustling rube,<br> with a little taste.<br> Good nutrition's given you length of bone,<br> but you're not more than one generation<br> from poor white trash, are you?<br> And that accent you've tried so<br> desperately to shed: pure West Virginia.<br> What is your father, dear? Is he<br> a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp?<br> How quickly the boys found you.<br> All those tedious, sticky fumblings<br> in the back seats of cars,<br> while you could only dream of<br> getting out, getting anywhere,<br> getting all the way to the FBI.<br> You see a lot, Doctor.<br> But are you strong enough to point<br> that high-powered perception at yourself?<br> What about it? Why don't you look at<br> yourself and write down what you see?<br> Or maybe you're afraid to.<br> A census taker once tried to test me.<br> I ate his liver with some fava beans<br> and a nice Chianti.<br> You fly back to school now, little Starling.<br> Fly, fly, fly.<br> I bit my wrist so I can die.<br> Look at the blood!<br> - Got ya!<br> - Miggs, you stupid fuck!<br> - I'm gonna kill him!<br> - Agent Starling! Come back!<br> Agent Starling! Agent Starling!<br> I would not have had that happen to you.<br> - Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly.<br> - Then do this test.<br> No, but I'll give you a chance<br> for what you love most.<br> - And what is that?<br> - Advancement. Listen carefully.<br> Look deep within yourself,<br> Clarice Starling.<br> Go seek out Miss Mofet,<br> an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.<br> I don't think Miggs could manage again<br> so soon, even though he is crazy. Go!<br> Hey, Bill.<br> - Daddy!<br> - Hey, Clarice.<br> - Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?<br> - No, angel. They all got away today.<br> FBI. Hands up. Don't move.<br> Turn around.<br> Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.<br> You're dead, Starling.<br> Johnson, good entry, good command.<br> Starling, where's your danger area?<br> - The corner.<br> - Did you check?<br> - No.<br> - That's why you're dead.<br> to enter or exit.<br> Rule 404.<br> - Clarice, phone. It's the guru.<br> - Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.<br> - Starling?<br> - Sir?<br> Miggs is dead.<br> Dead?<br> How?<br> They heard Lecter whispering to him<br> all afternoon and Miggs crying.<br> They found him at bed check.<br> He'd swallowed his own tongue.<br> - Starling?<br> - Yeah. I'm still here, sir.<br> I just... I don't know how to feel about this.<br> You don't have to feel any way about it.<br> Lecter did it to amuse himself.<br> Look, I know it got ugly today, but<br> you mentioned a name at the end: Mofet.<br> Any follow-up on her?<br> Lecter altered or destroyed<br> most of his patients" histories,<br> so there's no record<br> of anyone named Mofet, but<br> I thought the "yourself" reference<br> was too hokey for Lecter,<br> so I figured he's from Baltimore<br> and I looked in the phone book<br> and there's a "Your Self" storage facility<br> right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.<br> Unit 31 was leased for ten years,<br> pre-paid in full.<br> The contract is in the name<br> of a Miss Hester Mofet.<br> So nobody's been in here since 1980?<br> Not to my knowledge.<br> Privacy is a great concern<br> to my customers.<br> Yes. I won't disturb anything, I promise.<br> I'll be outta here before you know it.<br> - May I help you?<br> - Yes, actually.<br> - It's stuck.<br> - We could return tomorrow with my son.<br> What about him?<br> I would ask my driver to help you,<br> but he detests physical labor.<br> Right. Well, you just stay here.<br> I'll be back in one minute.<br> It's stuck. Hand me that flashlight, sir.<br> If this door should fall down<br> or anything else,<br> this is the number for<br> our Baltimore field office.<br> Now they know that you're with me.<br> Call them if anything should happen.<br> Yes, Miss Starling.<br> Clarice. They're waiting for you.<br> Watch your step.<br> Hester Mofet. It's an anagram,<br> isn't it, Doctor?<br> Hester Mofet. "The rest of me."<br> "Miss the rest of me."<br> Meaning that you rented that garage?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Your bleeding has stopped.<br> How did you...?<br> It's nothing. It was just a scratch.<br> Dr Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?<br> Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?<br> - Do you know something about him?<br> - I might if I saw the case file.<br> - You could get that for me.<br> - Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?<br> You wanted me to find him.<br> His real name is Benjamin Raspail,<br> a former patient of mine,<br> whose romantic attachments ran to,<br> shall we say, the ex otic.<br> I did not kill him, merely tucked him<br> away very much as I found him,<br> after he'd missed three appointments.<br> - If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?<br> - Who can say? Best thing for him, really.<br> His therapy was going nowhere.<br> His dress, make-up...<br> - Raspail was a transvestite?<br> - In life? Oh, no.<br> Garden-variety manic-depressive.<br> Tedious, very tedious.<br> I now just think of him<br> as a kind of experiment.<br> A fledgling killer's<br> first effort at transformation.<br> How did you feel<br> when you saw him, Clarice?<br> Scared at first, then exhilarated.<br> Jack Crawford is helping your career.<br> Apparently he likes you and you like him.<br> I never thought about it.<br> Do you think Jack Crawford<br> wants you, sexually?<br> True, he is much older, but do you think<br> he visualizes scenarios, ex changes,<br> fucking you?<br> That doesn't interest me and, frankly,<br> it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.<br> Not any more.<br> Thank you, Barney.<br> What happened to your drawings?<br> Punishment, you see, for Miggs.<br> Just like that gospel program.<br> When you leave,<br> they'll turn the volume way up.<br> Dr Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.<br> What did you mean<br> by "transformation", Doctor?<br> I've been in this room<br> for eight years now, Clarice.<br> I know they will never ever<br> let me out while I'm alive.<br> What I want is a view.<br> I want a window where I can<br> see a tree, or even water.<br> I want to be in a federal institution<br> far away from Dr Chilton.<br> What did you mean by "fledgling killer"?<br> Are you saying that he's killed again?<br> I'm offering you a psychological profile of<br> Buffalo Bill, based on the case evidence.<br> I'll help you catch him, Clarice.<br> You know who he is, don't you?<br> Tell me who decapitated<br> your patient, Doctor.<br> All good things to those who wait.<br> I've waited, Clarice, but how long<br> can you and old Jackie Boy wait?<br> Our little Billy must already be<br> searching for that next special lady.<br> MEMPHIS, TN<br> Hey, little cheeper.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Can I help you with that?<br> - Would you?<br> - Sure.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You look kinda handicapped.<br> Yeah. I got it this far. I just can't<br> get it up in the truck by myself.<br> - Here. Grab this.<br> - OK.<br> Just set it down. That's good.<br> Get in the truck.<br> I wanna push it all the way up.<br> I really appreciate this.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> Push it all the way back.<br> - Is this good?<br> - Yeah.<br> - That's great.<br> - OK.<br> Say, are you about a size 14?<br> Sorry?<br> Good.<br> Oh, good.<br> Good.<br> Starling!<br> Outside. Let's go.<br> Cindy. In the ring for Starling. Let's go.<br> FBI!<br> Pack your field gear.<br> You're going with Crawford.<br> - Where?<br> - They found a girl's body.<br> Been in the water a week.<br> It's a Buffalo Bill situation.<br> CLAY COUNTY, W VA<br> He keeps them alive for three days.<br> We don't know why.<br> No evidence of rape<br> or physical abuse prior to death.<br> All the mutilation<br> you see there is postmortem.<br> OK, three days. Then he shoots them,<br> skins them and dumps them,<br> each body in a different river.<br> The water leaves us<br> no trace evidence of any kind.<br> That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.<br> Her body was the only one<br> he took the trouble to weight down,<br> so actually she was the third girl found.<br> After her, he got lazy.<br> OK, let's see.<br> Circles where the girls were abducted.<br> Arrows where their bodies were found.<br> This new one today washed up here.<br> Elk River, West Virginia.<br> Look at him, Starling.<br> Tell me what you see.<br> He's a white male. Serial killers tend<br> to hunt within their own ethnic groups.<br> He's not a drifter. He's got his own<br> house somewhere, not an apartment.<br> - Why?<br> - What he does with them takes privacy.<br> He's in his thirties or forties.<br> He's got real physical strength,<br> combined with<br> an older man's self-control.<br> He's cautious, precise...<br> And he's never impulsive.<br> He'll never stop.<br> Why not?<br> Got a real taste for it now<br> and he's getting better at his work.<br> Not bad, Starling. Questions?<br> Yes, sir. You haven't mentioned anything<br> about the information in my report<br> or Dr Lecter's offer, sir.<br> - I'm considering it.<br> - That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?<br> To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?<br> Well, if that was the case, then<br> I just wish I was in on it, that's all.<br> If I'd sent you in with an actual agenda,<br> Lecter would have known it instantly.<br> He would have toyed with you<br> then turned to stone.<br> Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.<br> These are the FBI people.<br> Sheriff Perkins - Jack Crawford, FBI.<br> Special Agent Terry.<br> Agent Starling. We appreciate<br> being invited into your jurisdiction.<br> I didn't call you. That was<br> the state attorney's office.<br> - We'll extend you every courtesy, but...<br> - Sheriff.<br> This type of sex crime has certain aspects<br> I'd just as soon discuss in private.<br> Know what I mean?<br> - Oscar, fetch Dr Akins from the chapel.<br> - Starling, we're back here.<br> Tell Lamar to come on<br> when he's finished playing his music.<br> Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.<br> I need a six-way linkup.<br> Chicago, Detroit...<br> What?<br> Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> You officers and gentlemen,<br> Listen here now.<br> There's things we need to do for her.<br> I know that y'all brought her this far and<br> her folks would thank you if they could<br> for your kindness and your sensitivity.<br> But now please go on now<br> and let us take care of her.<br> Go on now.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> OK, good.<br> Yeah, that's right. Elk River.<br> Stand by for transmission.<br> Ray.<br> Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.<br> OK, Starling.<br> Bill.<br> Star-shaped contact entrance wound<br> over the sternum.<br> A muzzle stamp at the top.<br> Wrongful death.<br> She'll have to go to<br> the state pathologist at Claxton.<br> Well, I'd better get back to that service.<br> Lamar'll help you.<br> Lord Almighty.<br> What else do you see, Starling?<br> Well, she's not local.<br> Her ears are pierced three times<br> and there's glitter nail polish.<br> That looks like town to me.<br> Two of her fingernails are broken off<br> and there's dirt or grit under them.<br> It looks like she's tried<br> to claw her way through something.<br> Ray, get pictures of her teeth.<br> We'll fax 'em for Missing Persons.<br> Let's do another.<br> She's got something in her throat.<br> When a body comes out of the water,<br> lots of times there's leaves in the mouth.<br> What is that? Some kind of seed pod?<br> No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.<br> There's no way that could<br> get way down in there.<br> Not unless somebody shoved it in there.<br> She'll be easier to print when we turn<br> her over. Lamar, give me a hand.<br> Yes, sir. I will.<br> - Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?<br> - Different configuration than the others.<br> - Get close-ups.<br> - The victim's skin removed,<br> this time in two large diamond-shaped<br> sections above the buttocks.<br> Exit wound level with the second<br> or the third thoracic vertebrae,<br> six inches from the right shoulder blade.<br> Starling, when I told that sheriff<br> we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,<br> that really burned you, didn't it?<br> It was just smoke, Starling.<br> I had to get rid of him.<br> It matters, Mr Crawford.<br> Cops look at you to see how to act.<br> - It matters.<br> - Point taken.<br> Ligature marks found around the wrists,<br> not around the ankles.<br> This would indicate that<br> the skinning was postmortem.<br> - Time, Pilch. My move.<br> - You lured him with produce.<br> Tough noogies. It's still my turn.<br> Nice and slow, baby.<br> If the beetle moves one of your men,<br> does that still count?<br> Course it counts. How do you play?<br> Agent Starling?<br> Where the heck did this come from?<br> It's practically mush.<br> It was found behind the soft palate<br> of a murder victim in the Elk River.<br> - It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?<br> - I can't tell you any more.<br> - We heard about it on the radio.<br> - This is a clue from a real murder case?<br> - Cool.<br> - Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.<br> Sphingid ceratomia, maybe.<br> Boy, he's a big sucker.<br> OK. Let's check morphology.<br> What do you do when you're<br> not detecting, Agent Starling?<br> I try to be a student, Dr Pilcher.<br> Ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?<br> The amusing house wine?<br> Are you hitting on me, Doctor?<br> Yes.<br> - Gotcha.<br> - What have you got?<br> Agent Starling, meet Mr Acherontia styx.<br> Weird.<br> Better known to his friends<br> as the death's-head moth.<br> - Where does it come from?<br> - It's strange. They only live in Asia.<br> Here they'd have to be<br> raised from imported eggs.<br> Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey<br> and nightshade, kept him warm.<br> Somebody loved him.<br> Where are you?<br> Let me outta here!<br> Help me!<br> Please!<br> Please help me.<br> Please!<br> Why won't you answer me? Please!<br> - Good morning. I'm Donna Feruchi.<br> - I'm Gene Cassel with sports.<br> And I'm Tim Langhorn.<br> Our top story for this morning:<br> Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old<br> daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,<br> listed as missing, is now<br> believed to have been kidnapped<br> by the serial killer<br> known only as Buffalo Bill.<br> Police indicate that the girl's<br> blouse has been identified,<br> sliced up the back, in what has become<br> a grim, all-too-familiar calling card.<br> Young Catherine Martin is the only<br> daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,<br> the Republican senator from Tennessee.<br> Her kidnapping is not considered<br> to be politically motivated,<br> but it has stirred<br> the government to its highest levels.<br> Reached for comment on the ski slopes<br> of Vermont, the president is said to be,<br> and I quote, "intensely concerned".<br> Just moments ago Senator Martin<br> taped this dramatic personal plea.<br> I'm speaking now to the person<br> who is holding my daughter.<br> Catherine is very gentle and kind.<br> Talk to her and you'll see.<br> You have the power. You are in charge.<br> I know you can feel love and compassion.<br> You have a wonderful chance<br> to show the whole world<br> that you can be merciful<br> as well as strong,<br> that you're big enough to treat Catherine<br> better than the world has treated you.<br> You have that power.<br> Please.<br> My daughter is Catherine.<br> Boy, that's smart.<br> Jesus, that's really smart.<br> She keeps repeating the name.<br> If he sees Catherine as a person and not<br> just an object, it's harder to tear her up.<br> Release my little girl.<br> You're coming into my hospital<br> to conduct an interview<br> and refusing to share information<br> with me for the third time.<br> Sir, I told you, this is just a routine<br> follow-up on the Raspail case.<br> - He is my patient. I have rights.<br> - I understand that, sir.<br> Look, I am not just<br> some turnkey, Miss Starling.<br> This is the number<br> for the US attorney's office.<br> Either you discuss this with him or you<br> let me do my job, do you understand?<br> If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill<br> in time to save Catherine Martin,<br> the senator promises you a transfer<br> to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New<br> York, with a view of the woods nearby.<br> Maximum security still applies, of course.<br> You'd have reasonable access to books.<br> Best of all, though,<br> one week of the year,<br> you get to leave the hospital<br> and go here.<br> Plum Island.<br> Every day of that week you may walk on<br> the beach, you may swim in the ocean,<br> for up to one hour, under SWA team surveillance, of course.<br> And there you have it.<br> A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.<br> A copy of the senator's offer.<br> This offer is non-negotiable and final.<br> Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.<br> "Plum Island Animal Disease<br> Research Centre."<br> Sounds charming.<br> That's only a part of the island.<br> There's a very nice beach.<br> - Terns nest there. There's beautiful...<br> - Terns?<br> If I help you, Clarice,<br> it will be "turns" with us too.<br> Quid pro quo. I tell you things,<br> you tell me things.<br> Not about this case, though.<br> About yourself.<br> Quid pro quo. Yes or no?<br> Yes or no, Clarice?<br> Poor little Catherine is waiting.<br> Go, Doctor.<br> What is your worst memory of childhood?<br> The death of my father.<br> Tell me about it and don't lie, or I'll know.<br> He was a town marshal.<br> One night he surprised two burglars<br> coming out the back of a drugstore.<br> They shot him.<br> Was he killed outright?<br> No, he was very strong.<br> He lasted more than a month.<br> My mother died when I was very young.<br> My father had become the whole world to<br> me, and, when he left me, I had nothing.<br> I was ten years old.<br> You're very frank, Clarice.<br> I think it would be quite something<br> to know you in private life.<br> Quid pro quo, Doctor.<br> So tell me about Miss West Virginia.<br> Was she a large girl?<br> - Yes.<br> - Big through the hips? Roomy?<br> - They all were.<br> - What else?<br> She had an object deliberately<br> inserted into her throat.<br> Now, that hasn't been made public yet.<br> We don't know what it means.<br> Was it a butterfly?<br> Yes. A moth.<br> Just like the one we found<br> in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.<br> Why does he place them there, Doctor?<br> The significance of the moth is change.<br> Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa,<br> and from thence into beauty.<br> Our Billy wants to change, too.<br> There's no correlation between<br> transsexualism and violence.<br> - Transsexuals are very passive.<br> - Clever girl.<br> You're so close to the way you're<br> gonna catch him, do you realize that?<br> No. Tell me why.<br> After your father's murder you were<br> orphaned. What happened next?<br> I don't imagine the answer is<br> on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.<br> I lived with my mother's cousin and her<br> husband in Montana. They had a ranch.<br> - Was it a cattle ranch?<br> - Sheep and horses.<br> - How long did you live there?<br> - Two months.<br> - Why so briefly?<br> - I ran away.<br> Why, Clarice? Did the rancher<br> make you perform fellatio?<br> Did he sodomise you?<br> No. He was a very decent man.<br> Quid pro quo, Doctor.<br> Billy is not a real transsexual.<br> But he thinks he is. He tries to be.<br> He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.<br> You said that I was very close to the way<br> we would catch him. What did you mean?<br> There are three centers for<br> transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,<br> the University of Minnesota<br> and Columbus Medical Centre.<br> I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied<br> for sex reassignment at all of them<br> and been rejected.<br> On what basis would they reject him?<br> Look for severe childhood disturbances<br> associated with violence.<br> Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.<br> He was made one through years<br> of systematic abuse.<br> Billy hates his own identity, you see,<br> and he thinks<br> that makes him a transsexual.<br> But his pathology is<br> a thousand times more savage<br> and more terrifying.<br> It rubs the lotion on its skin.<br> It does this whenever it's told.<br> Mister, my family'll pay cash. Whatever<br> ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.<br> It rubs the lotion on its skin<br> or else it gets the hose again.<br> Yes, it will, Precious. It will get the hose.<br> OK, OK.<br> Mister, if you let me go,<br> I won't press charges, I promise.<br> See, my mom is a real important woman.<br> I guess you already know that.<br> Now it places the lotion in the basket.<br> Please!<br> Please!<br> I wanna go home, please!<br> It places the lotion in the basket.<br> I wanna see my mommy!<br> Please!<br> I wanna see my...<br> I wanna see my mommy.<br> Put the fucking lotion in the basket!<br> You still think you're gonna walk<br> on some beach and see the birdies?<br> I don't think so.<br> I called Senator Ruth Martin.<br> She never heard of any deal with you.<br> They scammed you, Hannibal.<br> Stand outside.<br> And shut the door.<br> There never was a deal with<br> Senator Martin, but there is now.<br> I designed it. Of course, I worked in a few<br> conditions for my own benefit as well.<br> Identify Buffalo Bill by name<br> and, if the girl is found in time,<br> Senator Martin will have you transferred<br> to the state prison in Tennessee.<br> Answer me, Hannibal.<br> You answer me now or, by God,<br> you'll never leave this cell.<br> Who is Buffalo Bill?<br> His first name is Louis.<br> I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,<br> but only in Tennessee.<br> And I have a few conditions of my own.<br> Clean him up and get him ready to go.<br> Jack, Hannibal Lecter's<br> being transferred to Memphis.<br> Transferred?<br> Did you have a trainee make a phoney<br> offer to Lecter in the senator's name?<br> Yeah, I rolled the dice. I had to.<br> Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.<br> Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.<br> She's asking him<br> to take over in Memphis.<br> MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPOR<br> Welcome to Memphis. I'm Lieutenant<br> Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.<br> We'll treat you as good as you treat us.<br> You be a gentleman, you're gonna<br> get three hots and a cot.<br> Sir. You sign right here,<br> we'll have us a legal transfer.<br> Where's...?<br> Here, sir. Use mine.<br> Senator Martin, Dr Hannibal Lecter.<br> Dr Lecter, I brought an affidavit<br> guaranteeing your new rights.<br> You'll wanna read it before I sign.<br> I won't waste your time or Catherine's<br> time, bargaining for petty privileges.<br> Clarice Starling and that awful Jack<br> Crawford have wasted far too much time.<br> I only pray they haven't<br> doomed the poor girl.<br> Let me help you now and I will<br> trust you when it is all over.<br> You have my word. Paul?<br> Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.<br> I met him just once. He was referred<br> to me in April or May 1980<br> by my patient, Benjamin Raspail.<br> They were lovers, you see.<br> But Raspail had become very frightened.<br> Apparently, Louis had<br> murdered a transient<br> and done things with the skin.<br> We need his address<br> and a physical description.<br> Tell me, Senator. Did you<br> nurse Catherine yourself?<br> - What?<br> - Did you breast-feed her?<br> - Now, wait a minute.<br> - Yes, I did.<br> - Toughened your nipples, didn't it?<br> - You son of a bitch!<br> Amputate a man's leg and<br> he can still feel it tickling.<br> Tell me, Mom, when your little girl<br> is on the slab, where will it tickle you?<br> Take this thing back to Baltimore.<br> Five foot ten, strongly built,<br> about 180 pounds.<br> Hair blond, eyes pale blue.<br> He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived<br> in Philadelphia but may have lied.<br> That's all I can remember, Mom, but if<br> I think of any more, I will let you know.<br> And, Senator, just one more thing.<br> Love your suit.<br> In a meeting this evening<br> with Senator Ruth Martin,<br> Dr Lecter agreed<br> to assist in the investigation<br> of trying to find the abductor, Buffalo Bill.<br> - How do you fit in?<br> - My insight into Lecter's mind<br> - made this breakthrough possible.<br> - Buffalo Bill's real name?<br> That is now a matter of record<br> with the proper authorities.<br> - My name is Dr Frederick Chilton.<br> - How do you spell that?<br> - Are you with Dr Chilton's group?<br> - Well, I just saw him outside, sir.<br> Access to Lecter is limited.<br> We've been getting death threats.<br> I understand, sir.<br> Log in and check your weapon.<br> I can't take all the credit.<br> Senator Martin, the Justice Department,<br> people at the FBI, folks<br> at the Baltimore state hospital.<br> And now for the hard part:<br> apprehending the suspect.<br> Excuse me, folks.<br> I'm gonna have to catch a flight.<br> Is it true what they're sayin'?<br> He's some kind of vampire?<br> They don't have a name for what he is.<br> You do know the rules, ma'am?<br> Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.<br> I've questioned him before.<br> Go ahead.<br> Good evening, Clarice.<br> I thought you might like<br> your drawings back, Doctor.<br> Just until you get your view.<br> How very thoughtful.<br> Or did Jack Crawford send you<br> for one last wheedle<br> before you're both booted off the case?<br> No, I came because I wanted to.<br> People will say we're in love.<br> Anthrax Island.<br> That was an especially<br> nice touch, Clarice.<br> - Yours?<br> - Yes.<br> Yeah.<br> That was good.<br> Pity about poor Catherine, though.<br> Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.<br> Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.<br> Louis Friend?<br> Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.<br> Oh, Clarice, your problem is<br> you need to get more fun out of life.<br> You were telling me the truth back in<br> Baltimore, sir. Please continue now.<br> I've read the case files. Have you?<br> Everything you need to find him<br> is there in those pages.<br> - Then tell me how.<br> - First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.<br> Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each<br> particular thing, ask what is it in itself?<br> What is its nature?<br> What does he do, this man you seek?<br> - He kills women.<br> - No. That is incidental.<br> What is the first thing he does?<br> What needs does he serve by killing?<br> Anger.<br> Social acceptance.<br> - Sexual frustrations.<br> - No. He covets.<br> That is his nature.<br> And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?<br> Do we seek out things to covet?<br> Make an effort to answer now.<br> No. We just...<br> No, we begin by coveting<br> what we see every day.<br> Don't you feel eyes<br> moving over your body, Clarice?<br> And don't your eyes seek out<br> the things you want?<br> All right, yes. Now please tell me how...<br> No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.<br> You don't have any more<br> vacations to sell.<br> Why did you leave that ranch?<br> Doctor, we don't have<br> any more time for any of this now.<br> But we don't reckon time<br> the same way, do we?<br> - This is all the time you'll ever have.<br> - Later. Listen to me. We've only got five...<br> No. I will listen now.<br> After your father's murder,<br> you were orphaned.<br> You went to live with cousins on<br> a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.<br> And?<br> And one morning I just ran away.<br> Not "just", Clarice. What set you off?<br> - You started at what time?<br> - Early. Still dark.<br> Then something woke you, didn't it?<br> Was it a dream? What was it?<br> I heard a strange noise.<br> What was it?<br> It was screaming.<br> Some kind of screaming.<br> Like a child's voice.<br> What did you do?<br> I went downstairs.<br> Outside.<br> I crept up into the barn.<br> I was so scared to look inside,<br> but I had to.<br> What did you see, Clarice?<br> What did you see?<br> Lambs.<br> They were screaming.<br> They were slaughtering the spring lambs?<br> And they were screaming.<br> - And you ran away?<br> - No. First I tried to free them.<br> I opened the gate to their pen,<br> but they wouldn't run.<br> They just stood there, confused.<br> They wouldn't run.<br> But you could - and you did, didn't you?<br> Yes. I took one lamb<br> and I ran away as fast as I could.<br> - Where were you going, Clarice?<br> - I don't know. I didn't have any food,<br> any water and it was very cold, very cold.<br> I thought...<br> I thought if I could save just one, but...<br> He was so heavy.<br> So heavy.<br> I didn't get more than a few miles<br> when the sheriff's car picked me up.<br> The rancher was so angry, he sent me<br> to live at the orphanage in Bozeman.<br> I never saw the ranch again.<br> What became of your lamb, Clarice?<br> - He killed him.<br> - You still wake up sometimes, don't you?<br> Wake up in the dark<br> and hear the screaming of the lambs?<br> Yes.<br> And you think, if you save poor Catherine,<br> you could make them stop, don't you?<br> You think if Catherine lives,<br> you won't wake up in the dark ever again<br> to that awful screaming of the lambs.<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> Thank you, Clarice.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Tell me his name, Doctor.<br> Dr Chilton, I presume.<br> I think you know each other.<br> OK.<br> - Let's go.<br> - It's your turn, Doctor.<br> - Out.<br> - Tell me his name.<br> Sorry, ma'am. I've got orders. I have<br> to put you on a plane. Come on now.<br> Brave Clarice.<br> You will let me know when those lambs<br> stop screaming, won't you?<br> - Tell me his name, Doctor.<br> - Clarice.<br> Your case file.<br> Goodbye, Clarice.<br> - Ready when you are, doc.<br> - Just another minute, please.<br> Son of a bitch demanded a second<br> dinner. Lamb chops, extra rare.<br> I wonder what he wants for breakfast.<br> Some damn thing from the zoo?<br> - Good evening, gentlemen.<br> - OK, doc. Grab some floor.<br> Same drill as before, please.<br> Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.<br> OK.<br> Hand me that, would ya?<br> Thanks.<br> Mind the drawings, please.<br> Thank you.<br> Watch it. He's cuffed me!<br> Jesus Christ!<br> Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.<br> What is this shit?<br> - Did somebody go up on five?<br> - No. Nobody went up.<br> Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...<br> CP. Shots fired on five.<br> Repeat: shots fired on five.<br> Sergeant Tate.<br> - Holy shit.<br> - What the hell...?<br> Shut up. Bobby, get the vest.<br> - Right, sarge.<br> - Brady, Howard, cover...<br> Look!<br> - It's stopped.<br> - Seal off a ten-block radius.<br> Get me the SWAT team<br> and an ambulance double-quick.<br> We're goin' up.<br> Pembry!<br> Boyle!<br> Oh, God.<br> Go.<br> - Clear.<br> - Command post.<br> Two officers down.<br> - Lecter's gone, sarge.<br> - Prisoner is missing.<br> - Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.<br> - Repeat: Lecter is missing and armed.<br> He's stripped the bed. Might be<br> makin' a rope. Check all windows.<br> Where the fuck is my ambulance?<br> He's alive. Sergeant Tate, he's alive.<br> Get a hold of him<br> and feel his hand. Talk to him.<br> - What do I say?<br> - It's Jim Pembry. Talk to him, dammit!<br> Lecter is missing and armed.<br> Pembry, can you hear me?<br> He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one<br> round. There's a chance Lecter was hit.<br> Keep breathin' in and out.<br> That's it. You're doing a good job.<br> You look real good.<br> Yeah, you look real good.<br> - You ready?<br> - Let's do it.<br> Let's go.<br> Looking good, Pembry. You're gonna<br> make it. You're doin' just fine.<br> I need that IV now!<br> Can we get the straps?<br> Where's the fucking oxygen?<br> Stay with me. Stay with me here.<br> We're losin' him. Downstairs.<br> And up.<br> Elevator!<br> CP to Tate.<br> Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.<br> I'm on the elevator<br> bringing Pembry down.<br> He seems to be hangin' on.<br> Top three floors secured.<br> Main stairwell secured.<br> We think he's on two.<br> Tate, are you still with me?<br> We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two,<br> sir. That's all for now. Over.<br> He's on the roof of the elevator.<br> OK, guys.<br> I see him.<br> There's a gun by his hand.<br> He's not moving.<br> - One warning: we need him alive.<br> - Got it.<br> Lecter, put your hands on your head.<br> One in the leg.<br> No movement.<br> Johnny, hold your fire.<br> We're comin' into the car.<br> We're openin' the hatch.<br> Watch his hands.<br> If there's any fire, it'll come from us.<br> - Affirm.<br> - Got it.<br> Memphis General, medical unit 26.<br> We're inbound with a male police officer<br> with severe facial lacerations.<br> Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal<br> seizure activity but he's post-ictal now.<br> Vital signs are good.<br> Pressure is 130 over 90.<br> - 90?<br> - Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 84.<br> We got him on lactated Ringer's and<br> the patient is on ten litres of oxygen...<br> They found the ambulance in a parking<br> garage at the airport. Crew was dead.<br> He killed a tourist, too.<br> Got his clothes, cash.<br> - By now he could be anywhere.<br> - He won't come after me.<br> - Oh, really?<br> - He won't.<br> I can't explain it.<br> He would consider that rude.<br> - It's over. She's dead.<br> - It's not your fault it worked out like this.<br> The thing is that Lecter said everything<br> we need to catch him is in these pages.<br> Dr Lecter said a lot of things.<br> He's here, Ardelia.<br> Is this Lecter's handwriting?<br> "Clarice, doesn't this random scattering<br> of sites seem desperately random,<br> Like the elaboration of a bad liar?<br> Hannibal Lecter."<br> Desperately random?<br> What does he mean?<br> Not random at all, maybe.<br> Like there's some pattern here.<br> But there is no pattern<br> or the computers would have nailed it.<br> - They were even found in random order.<br> - Random because of the one girl.<br> - The one he weighted down.<br> - Fredrica Bimmel.<br> From Belvedere, Ohio.<br> First girl taken, third body found.<br> - Why?<br> - She didn't drift. He weighted her down.<br> What did Lecter say<br> about the first principles?<br> - Simplicity.<br> - What does this guy do? He covets.<br> How do we first start to covet?<br> - We covet what we see...<br> - Every day.<br> - Hot damn, Clarice.<br> - He knew her.<br> BELVEDERE, OHIO<br> - Mr Bimmel?<br> - That's me.<br> I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.<br> I sure appreciate you letting me<br> take a look around, Mr Bimmel.<br> I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.<br> Police been back here<br> so many times already.<br> Fredrica went into Chicago<br> on the bus to see about a job.<br> She left the interview OK.<br> She never come home.<br> Her bedroom's how she left it.<br> Upstairs.
