                        Do you know<br> where you are, Mrs. Cunningham?<br> Where is he?<br> As if he were crouching behind me.<br> - Why am I afraid to look at him?<br> - You know, don't you, Mrs. Cunningham?<br> In New York, of course.<br> I used to live in Evanston, Illinois.<br> That's where I was born.<br> It's right near Chicago.<br> Did you sleep well<br> last night, Mrs. Cunningham?<br> - How are you today?<br> - Very well, thank you.<br> Who is he and why all those questions?<br> As if he were testing me.<br> - Do you hear voices?<br> - Think I'm deaf? I hear yours.<br> It's hard to keep on being civil<br> when they ask you such naive questions.<br> But who's that?<br> And what's happened to him?<br> You suspect him of anything.<br> He's clever,<br> but he can't fool me with his magic.<br> It's an old trick,<br> changing into a girl.<br> Oh, no. She can't be he.<br> She doesn't ask questions.<br> Pardon me, but you look pale.<br> Have you been job hunting?<br> - Virginia, don't be silly.<br> - You know my name?<br> You must have seen it on my bag.<br> I don't know where it is.<br> I was going to get some groceries<br> and go back to the apartment.<br> Oh, could you tell me how to get to...<br> What are you talking about?<br> How to get to where?<br> Where? What's the name of the street?<br> It's the sun.<br> It's too warm.<br> I'm worried about you, Virginia. I wasn't<br> gonna tell you this, but I'm going to one.<br> Maybe I'll be leaving from there.<br> Before long, I'll be on my own...<br> wondering where the next meal's<br> coming from.<br> - Look, how would you like to...<br> - All right, ladies.<br> - Let's go.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Please. You don't wanna make trouble.<br> - What is it? A fire? A riot?<br> - Shh.<br> - All right, ladies. Fall in. Fall in.<br> - You heard me. I said fall in.<br> - Fall in? Fall in what?<br> - No talking, ladies.<br> - You see?<br> - Why do we have to stand with all of them?<br> - Come on, ladies.<br> Let's go.<br> Oh, I see. It's a zoo, a tour.<br> I don't like a zoo, do you?<br> I don't like the smell, and I'm sorry<br> for the animals, locked up in cages.<br> Don't talk now.<br> You know it's against the rules.<br> - Enjoy the sun, Virginia?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> People are friendly<br> in New York, or maybe just fresh.<br> I've never seen her before, and she calls me<br> Virginia. What am I supposed to say? Hi, kiddo?<br> Come on. Step along.<br> - Ruth, Minna, where are you going?<br> - Okay, Jean. They're all in.<br> Ward 3-A, step out.<br> No talking, ladies.<br> Mary, get up.<br> You know better than that. Come on.<br> Ward 3-A,<br> we haven't got all day.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - Keep in line, ladies.<br> - Why do we have to keep in line?<br> I don't like regimentation.<br> - Please, Virginia.<br> - Doing all right, Lucille?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> I may have to<br> make a speech against it.<br> - Against what?<br> - Regimentation, of course.<br> But l... I can't make a speech<br> without writing it first.<br> Now, now. Don't run, ladies.<br> - And no pushing.<br> - Quit pushing.! Somebody's pushing.!<br> - Come on.! Open the door.!<br> - Quiet. No talking.<br> - The way they treat us,<br> you'd think we were criminals.<br> - That's right.<br> - Criminals?<br> - Come on. Take over here,<br> will you? Let's go.<br> - Criminals?<br> - Come on, Virginia.<br> A prison?<br> That's it.<br> A prison. I should've known it.<br> - How did I get here?<br> - What's wrong, honey?<br> - Let me go. Let me go!<br> - Virginia, Miss Hart will hear you.<br> I won't stay here. I won't stay in this place<br> another minute. I wanna get out!<br> - What's the trouble?<br> - Nothing, Miss Hart. It's that<br> Virginia feels a little faint.<br> She got a little too much sun, I think.<br> She'll be all right.<br> Hello, Mrs. Cunningham. Miss Hart, we'd like<br> to speak to Mrs. Cunningham for a minute.<br> - Yes, Doctor. Go ahead, Grace.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Would you like<br> to sit down?<br> Don't be afraid, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> We're your friends.<br> We just want to talk to you.<br> - How do you feel today?<br> - Very well, thank you.<br> - Is there any reason<br> why I shouldn't feel well?<br> - No. Of course not.<br> Maybe you'll think it's strange<br> to ask you this, but somehow<br> people never remember my face.<br> - Do you know who I am, Mrs. Cunningham?<br> - Of course.<br> You do? Tell me.<br> - Don't you know?<br> - If you don't mind, would<br> you tell me just the same?<br> - The warden.<br> - The warden of what?<br> - Of this prison.<br> - Is there any reason why<br> you should be in prison?<br> Why, yes, of course.<br> I'm writing a novel about prisons...<br> and I've come here<br> to study conditions and take notes...<br> about one day's worth,<br> thank you, and I'm going to leave now.<br> Where will you go when...<br> when you leave here?<br> - To your husband?<br> - I have no husband.<br> - You haven't?<br> I thought you were married.<br> - I am married.<br> If you're married, doesn't that<br> mean that you have a husband?<br> Pardon me. It slipped my mind.<br> What's your name again?<br> Stuart. Virginia Stuart.<br> - Miss Stuart?<br> - No. Mrs. Stuart.<br> - Mrs. Stuart?<br> - Virginia, darling, look at me.<br> Don't you know who I am?<br> I'm Robert. Virginia.<br> All right, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> The nurse'll take you back now.<br> Come on, Virginia.<br> You know, I'll be really sorry<br> to leave those poor girls.<br> I asked you to come here because<br> I've been going over information<br> you gave about your work.<br> We've seldom had a case history<br> that told so little.<br> I wish I could tell you more<br> about it, Dr... I'm sorry, but<br> I can't quite pronounce your name.<br> "Kik's" all right.<br> That's what everybody calls me here.<br> Well, you see, Dr. Kik, my wife never<br> talked very much about herself or her family.<br> I always thought it was strange,<br> but when you love somebody,<br> you're not looking for symptoms.<br> Looking back now, I see things<br> I never thought were important.<br> - Would you like to tell me about them?<br> - First time I met her, Doctor...<br> was... was in Chicago.<br> I was a clerk in a publishing house<br> putting out some second-string magazines.<br> It was my first job<br> after getting out of the army.<br> It wasn't much.<br> I was taking my time getting settled...<br> but I kept my eyes open<br> for something better.<br> - That's where I saw her first.<br> - Miss Stuart.<br> - Yes?<br> - I'm sorry. Miss Gilmore's tied up right now.<br> She asked me to return your manuscript,<br> tell you she liked the story very much, but...<br> The idea is too depressing. The characters<br> aren't quite the way she'd like to see them.<br> And the end doesn't quite come off. Or is it<br> the beginning? I'm awfully glad she liked it.<br> - No, she did, but you see...<br> - She isn't going to publish it.<br> - Well, she said she hoped<br> you would understand.<br> - I hoped she would.<br> - Here. You may keep them.<br> - Thank you.<br> There was a place downstairs.<br> Every day, I made up my mind to eat<br> somewhere else, but I usually ended up there.<br> Thank you.<br> Keeps going up, huh?<br> I noticed her right away.<br> Sitting there, she looked like a kid who'd<br> been told to eat something she didn't want.<br> - Hello. Mind if I sit here?<br> - No.<br> Thank you.<br> - Your first one?<br> - First one I thought was good... until today.<br> - Look, may I tell you something<br> about our Miss Gilmore?<br> - No.<br> - You mean, you'd rather I wouldn't talk?<br> - No. I didn't mean that.<br> Well, Miss Gilmore<br> or no Miss Gilmore...<br> if I wrote a story I thought was good,<br> I wouldn't care what anybody said about it...<br> or how many editors<br> turned it down.<br> I'd stop smoking<br> and start eating.<br> - Why don't you fire Miss Gilmore<br> and read my story?<br> - I might at that.<br> After that, she used<br> to drop by the cafeteria every so often.<br> - Hello, Virginia.<br> - Hello.<br> She always had some kind of excuse<br> for coming. I didn't care.<br> I was just glad she did. It didn't take long<br> to find out we liked the same kind of things.<br> We liked music,<br> the same kind of music.<br> We liked walking together.<br> I knew a place where you got the best soda<br> in town. She loved it.<br> She didn't tell me much<br> about herself.<br> I knew she lived out of town,<br> but I didn't know where.<br> Somehow I thought she was grateful<br> that I didn't ask too many questions.<br> Sure, it was strange,<br> but maybe that's why I liked her.<br> She seemed to like me.<br> I don't know how many times we met...<br> but somehow I felt that she needed me,<br> like a child looking for protection.<br> - Then it was early in May, I think.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> - This was going to be our big day.<br> The Boston Philharmonic<br> was in Chicago playing Brahms First.<br> We planned to spend the whole afternoon<br> together and go to the concert.<br> I forgot to tell you.<br> You know the guy from overseas...<br> who said he'd get me<br> into the Alden Hotels in New York?<br> I got a letter from him the other day,<br> and it's all set if I want it.<br> Pay isn't much to start with, but<br> it's more than I'm getting here, so l...<br> Robert, I can't go to the concert.<br> Something's come up, something important.<br> - I'm sorry. I was trying to<br> tell you all afternoon.<br> - Virginia, what is it?<br> - What's it all about?<br> - It's no use, Robert. I'm sorry.<br> - I've got to leave right away.<br> I can't explain it.<br> - Virginia, wait a minute.<br> Let me go.<br> Let me go. Please!<br> - Let me go!<br> - That was the last<br> time I saw her in Chicago.<br> She didn't come back,<br> and I couldn't find her.<br> I came to New York<br> and took my newjob.<br> For six months,<br> I hadn't heard a word from her.<br> Then the Boston Philharmonic<br> was in New York.<br> Somehow, it had become a habit with me,<br> looking for her everywhere.<br> Maybe I was just hoping.<br> - Virginia.<br> - Hello.<br> I knew I'd see you again.<br> It wasn't a coincidence,<br> Doctor.<br> I'm sure it was something<br> we both wanted.<br> You mean to tell me<br> you've been in New York six months?<br> Where have you been?<br> What have you been hiding for?<br> Oh, I thought, I guess, that it'd<br> be all right if we just happened to meet...<br> on the street, on the subway,<br> in a restaurant.<br> - Tonight it wasn't an accident.<br> - Why didn't you call?<br> I told you where I was gonna work.<br> Why'd you run away from me in Chicago?<br> Why didn't you come back? Oh, I know.<br> You've got a deep, dark secret.<br> You killed somebody,<br> and the police are after you.<br> I don't care. I found you,<br> and I'm not gonna lose you again.<br> Tell me. What have<br> you been doing all these months?<br> Working 18 hours a day<br> and being lonely 24.<br> I'm selling toys at Braddock's on the<br> sixth floor, and I've been working on a novel.<br> It's almost done. Oh, you don't know<br> how good it is to see you again.<br> From then on,<br> we were happy, like any two people in love.<br> When I talked about getting married,<br> she wouldn't be pinned down.<br> I didn't wanna press her.<br> Battleship sailors<br> pose for a picture with the royal family.<br> The king, queen and two princesses<br> returning from South Africa.<br> Thank you.<br> - R.C.?<br> - Robert Cunningham,<br> and don't ever ask me for a match again.<br> Thank you, darling.<br> - You know something?<br> - What?<br> I love you very much.<br> - What's the matter, honey? Are you sick?<br> - I don't know. Probably.<br> It was so hot in the movie.<br> I'll be all right.<br> - Robert, do you really love me?<br> - You still don't know?<br> I do, but...<br> but you don't wanna marry me, do you?<br> I don't know<br> how many times I'd asked her to marry me...<br> but there on the subway platform,<br> for the first time, she brought it up.<br> - I could hardly believe it.<br> - If I want to?<br> - I get three days off at the end<br> of the month. How'd that be?<br> - The end of the month?<br> You see? I was right. You're just trying to<br> put it off. You don't really want to marry me.<br> Virginia!<br> First thing next morning,<br> we got our license.<br> Three days later...it was the seventh<br> of May... we were married.<br> A couple of days after that, I worked late.<br> Virginia?<br> Virginia?<br> Virginia?<br> - Darling, what are you doing out here?<br> - I can't sleep, Robert.<br> I don't think I'll ever<br> be able to sleep.<br> Well, come on inside, darling.<br> You're gonna catch cold.<br> That was the first time<br> she really frightened me.<br> Even then, I didn't suspect anything.<br> But two days later...<br> You know, darling, I'm worried<br> about the way you haven't been sleeping.<br> Last night again, I saw you...<br> Virginia, darling, don't you think<br> you'd better see a doctor?<br> - It's such a beautiful day.<br> - Yes, but...<br> Almost too beautiful<br> for November.<br> - What do you mean, November?<br> Are you kidding?<br> - What do you think it is?<br> May. May 12.<br> - Where do you see that?<br> - Well, here. You can see for yourself.<br> It's an old newspaper.<br> Can't you see? It's torn.<br> - Virginia, what is it? That's<br> this morning's newspaper.<br> - It isn't. It can't be.<br> - Virginia, why don't you<br> get dressed? We'll see a doctor.<br> - Doctor?<br> Yes. My head hurts. Robert,<br> there's something the matter with my head!<br> - Come on, darling. Let me help you.<br> - Who are you?<br> - Why do you torture me? Why do you lie to me?<br> - Virginia, what's the matter?<br> - Don't you know me? I'm Robert...<br> your husband Robert!<br> - Let me go! Let me go!<br> - Virginia, what's the matter?<br> - Let me go. Don't touch me.<br> - Virginia, don't you know I love you?<br> - Love me?<br> No, you can't make me love you! You can't<br> make me belong to you! You can't!<br> - Virginia.!<br> - I can't love you! I can't love anybody!<br> I can't!<br> The rest you know, Doctor.<br> You've no idea what that day in May<br> might mean to your wife?<br> - She never told you<br> anything more of her family?<br> - Just that her father died...<br> when she was about six and then her mother<br> married again... recently moved to Oregon.<br> Tell me.<br> When did you last see her in Chicago?<br> - I'd say it was about the first week in May.<br> - Could it have been the 12th?<br> It might have been. Do you<br> think there's a connection there?<br> Possibly.<br> Mr. Cunningham, I'd like to<br> use shock treatment on your wife...<br> but you'll have<br> to sign this consent.<br> Shock treatment. Isn't it...<br> I mean, do you have to?<br> The only reason I want to use it is because in<br> many cases, it helps establish contact faster.<br> When that happens, we'll be able<br> to start getting at the real<br> causes of your wife's illness.<br> - Isn't there any other way?<br> - Yes, if we had time, lots of time.<br> There are many things we're short of<br> in state hospitals, but time most of all.<br> I guess it was the word "shock" that...<br> Where do I sign, Doctor?<br> I want some water.<br> I'm thirsty.<br> Who's next?<br> - All right, Evelyn.<br> - Virginia?<br> - You'd better come over here. You're next.<br> - Go ahead, honey. It's your turn.<br> I'm afraid. I'm terribly afraid.<br> - We're ready, Evelyn.<br> - Come on, Virginia.<br> You go in now.<br> Come on.<br> - What are you doing here, Grace?<br> - I just came along with Virginia.<br> - How many more left?<br> - Twenty-three, Doctor.<br> Virginia Cunningham from three.<br> First treatment.<br> - Is this the patient<br> you told me about this morning?<br> - Yes.<br> - I see.<br> - All right, Virginia. Get on this table.<br> - Come on. I said to lie down on this table.<br> - How are you, Mrs. Cunningham?<br> You're going to electrocute me.<br> Was my crime so great?<br> No, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> Nobody's being electrocuted.<br> Dr. Sommer and I are just trying<br> to make you well. We're your friends.<br> All right, Nurse Davis.<br> Pat, Mary, get on this side. Evelyn.<br> Would they dare<br> to kill me without a trial?<br> If I say I demand a lawyer, they'll have<br> to do something. It's in the Constitution.<br> - Now, just relax, honey.<br> - Three against one. It isn't fair.<br> Yes. I'd better<br> call a lawyer right away.<br> - I want...<br> - Nurse Davis,<br> I want her held loosely.<br> - Just guide her arms and legs.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> Don't be afraid, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> I've got a place to go,<br> and the doctor knows it.<br> Ain't got a temperature<br> or nothin'.<br> Ain't got a temperature or nothin',<br> and you can go home.<br> - Where are you going, Margaret?<br> - John was here today.<br> He wouldn't take me home.<br> I want to see my baby.<br> He can't take you home to that<br> crowded house with all his folks around.<br> You know that, Margaret.<br> - That's why you're almost well...<br> because you know it.<br> - Yes. I couldn't go back.<br> They all knew what to do for the baby,<br> and they said I didn't.<br> I think you knew<br> better than they did.<br> Sometimes I forget...<br> because I want<br> to see the baby so much.<br> You will...<br> soon, Margaret.<br> John's trying to find a place<br> just for you and him.<br> - And the baby?<br> - Of course.<br> Go back to bed now. You don't want to<br> have a cold when John comes to visit again.<br> Thank you, Doctor. Somehow you can<br> make me understand things.<br> - I always feel so much better<br> after you've talked to me.<br> - All right, Margaret. Come on.<br> Dr. Kik?<br> - May I please talk to you for a second?<br> - Yes, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> - How long have I been here?<br> - Here? What do you mean?<br> - The hospital. It is a hospital, isn't it?<br> - You came in May.<br> - What month is this?<br> - October.<br> June, July, August, September, October.<br> Five months, and I don't<br> remember a moment of it.<br> - I don't remember a moment of it.<br> - You've been ill.<br> That's why you don't remember.<br> But you're much better now.<br> - Am I?<br> - Of course. Very much better.<br> Now you must sleep. I'll see you in my office<br> tomorrow, and we'll have a long talk.<br> Yes, Doctor.<br> Why do they hate me<br> when I love them so much?<br> Leave me alone, I tell you.<br> Just leave me alone.<br> I'm better, but I'm one of them.<br> - Do you still have<br> Mrs. Cunningham's chart here?<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> - May I have it?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Here it is.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I'm taking her off shock.<br> - But she didn't complete<br> the full course, did she?<br> No, Miss Hart. I was only using it<br> to establish contact with her.<br> Yes, Doctor.<br> Well, what are you waiting for?<br> You should know by now. On the table.<br> What's Mrs. Cunningham doing here?<br> Didn't you check her chart?<br> No, Doctor. Sorry, but it just so happened<br> that I didn't have the time.<br> Besides, I forgot that this is one<br> of your special cases.<br> You weren't supposed to come here<br> this morning. I'm sorry. It was a mistake.<br> I know, Doctor, that in addition to all this,<br> I'm supposed to be supervisor here...<br> but I don't have to tell you how many patients<br> we have here and nurses to take care of them.<br> You can go back<br> to the ward now.<br> Tell Miss Hart I want to see the patient<br> in my office in half an hour.<br> - Very well, Doctor.<br> - There are two more of my patients.<br> - Do you mind if I take them next?<br> - Of course not. Go right ahead.<br> All right, Virginia. You heard<br> what Dr. Kik said. You can go now.<br> Come on, Virginia.<br> Why does she hate me?<br> I haven't done anything, have I?<br> Come now.<br> - Wait outside, miss.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> - Would you like to sit down?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Did you have breakfast?<br> - If you can call it that.<br> - Would you like to smoke?<br> - No.<br> You do know who I am?<br> - You're the one who saved me out there.<br> - I didn't save you.<br> I didn't think you needed<br> any more shock treatments,<br> because last night in the dormitory...<br> - You remember talking<br> to me last night, don't you?<br> - Last night?<br> - Yes. I remember. You're Dr. Kik.<br> - That's right.<br> - Do you remember speaking<br> to me before last night?<br> - When?<br> Many times. In the ward.<br> In the courtyard. Here in this office.<br> I don't remember being here before,<br> but I remember your voice.<br> - I liked your voice.<br> - That's probably because<br> you liked talking to me.<br> - You told me I came here in May.<br> - Yes.<br> It was warm then.<br> Now the summer's over...<br> and I've lost all those months.<br> I know some of the problems you're facing,<br> and I know how you're struggling to solve them.<br> I want to help you, but I'll need<br> your cooperation. Do you understand that?<br> - I think so.<br> - Good.<br> Tell me, Mrs. Cunningham. What do you<br> remember of the time before you were ill...<br> before you came<br> to this hospital?<br> I don't remember anything.<br> I don't even remember coming here.<br> But before you came here,<br> when you were still outside, in New York.<br> New York. Yes.<br> I used to buy groceries,<br> and I was writing a novel.<br> - And I couldn't sleep.<br> - Yes, it's very bad, not being able to sleep.<br> You wake up early, and all kinds of<br> strange thoughts come into your mind.<br> - You're tired and frightened.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> I felt as if I'd done something,<br> and I just couldn't remember what...<br> - as if something was following me<br> all the time.<br> - I know.<br> You come to a point<br> where you just can't see any way out...<br> and you do things<br> which seem impossible to understand.<br> But you and I, we know there must be a reason,<br> like trying to push time out of your mind...<br> and saying it's November in May.<br> It's nothing to be ashamed of.<br> It could happen to anybody.<br> Why are you so nice to me?<br> Why are you so interested in me?<br> Because I want to help you.<br> I want you to feel that even if you think...<br> you did something you shouldn't have,<br> nobody'll punish you here.<br> Why do you want to make me love you? I can't<br> love anybody! I can't love anybody! I can't!<br> - You want to hurt me. Why?<br> - I don't...<br> Oh, I don't know why. I don't know.<br> - You want to hurt anybody<br> who tried to stop you...<br> from doing away with a day,<br> a very important day in your life.<br> Wouldn't it be better<br> to try to face it? May. May 12.<br> I don't know.<br> It means nothing, nothing.<br> - Unless...<br> - Unless?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't remember.<br> - Who was with you the morning you became ill?<br> - I was alone.<br> - You mean, your husband wasn't with you?<br> - I have no husband.<br> - You know that.<br> - You've told me many times you were married.<br> - How can you be married<br> without having a husband?<br> - Yes, that's strange, isn't it?<br> - What's your name?<br> - Virginia Stuart.<br> - Is that your full name?<br> - Isn't it?<br> No.<br> - Do you know?<br> - Of course.<br> - Tell me.<br> - Virginia Stuart Cunningham.<br> - Cunningham.<br> - Mrs. Robert Cunningham.<br> - Robert.<br> - Your husband.<br> - My husband.<br> - Isn't it better to know?<br> - Isn't it?<br> - Yes. Oh, yes.<br> Well, what<br> about a cigarette now?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Tell me. Do you remember the time<br> before you were married, in Chicago?<br> - That's where you met Robert, isn't it?<br> - Yes, I think so.<br> He was going to take you<br> to a concert, but you said...<br> something had come up<br> and you couldn't go with him.<br> - Concert? I'm sorry, Doctor.<br> I can't follow you.<br> - You ran away from him.<br> Where did you go?<br> - I don't know what you're talking about.<br> - Thank you, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> You can go back to the ward now.<br> I'll talk to you again soon.<br> Have l...<br> Have I seen him since I've been here?<br> Your husband came every visiting day,<br> even when he couldn't see you.<br> - He wants to see you very much.<br> - Should I see him?<br> - I think so.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> Good-bye, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> Nurse.<br> - Shall I have that?<br> - Thanks.<br> - You can take her back now.<br> - Come, Virginia.<br> Get me the New Alden Hotel in New York.<br> I want to speak to Mr. Cunningham.<br> - Come on. I'll hold it for you.<br> - Thanks.<br> I remember this suit. It's a little small,<br> but I bought it because it was reduced.<br> I always meant to have it altered.<br> Small?<br> I could be having a baby in this suit,<br> and nobody'd know the difference.<br> It's very nice, I think.<br> Sit down, Virginia.<br> - I wonder why Miss Hart made me dress up.<br> Maybe it's D.T.<br> - D.T.?<br> Occupational therapy.<br> Dressing therapy.<br> Look what's been in here<br> all this time.<br> It's like putting your hands<br> in someone else's pockets... a dead woman's.<br> Well, what do you know? Well, you look<br> like a million dollars in that suit, Virginia.<br> - I'd rather just look well in it.<br> - Ready?<br> - There. That's dandy.<br> - All right. Come with me, Virginia.<br> - See you later.<br> - Ready for what, Miss Hart?<br> You'll find out. Go along.<br> Go ahead, Virginia.<br> Fine. Thanks.<br> Right over there.<br> Robert.<br> It looks like him, but I must be careful.<br> Watch your step, honey.<br> Everything counts against you.<br> - Of course it's not him.<br> - Hello.<br> He even sounds like him.<br> They do a goodjob when they want to.<br> - Hello.<br> - You... You look wonderful, Virginia.<br> - Thank you.<br> This way,<br> Mr. Cunningham.<br> Dr. Kik said you can<br> take her into the yard...<br> and there's a place behind the hedge<br> where you can have your lunch.<br> - Thank you, Nurse.<br> - It's all right, Virginia. You can go.<br> - Do you have a key?<br> - This door isn't locked.<br> Isn't it?<br> That's funny. Usually<br> they're very careful about doors here.<br> You'd think they're<br> the most important things in the world.<br> - It's nice here, isn't it?<br> - Yes, very nice.<br> - What do you say<br> we make a picnic out of it, huh?<br> - That's fine.<br> Funny how the ground dried up.<br> It poured last night.<br> - It was the night before.<br> - Oh, then I must've lost another day.<br> I don't suppose I'll ever find it.<br> It's just a blank.<br> - What's in the box?<br> - All kinds of things.<br> Sometimes, before I came here,<br> I wished I could make my mind a blank.<br> Now I know<br> what a blank mind is.<br> I get up in the morning,<br> then suddenly it's time to go to bed.<br> And I can't remember<br> what happened in between.<br> Is it... Is it real?<br> Try it.<br> Oh, it is real!<br> I wish you could<br> have this every day.<br> They told me this was one<br> of the best hospitals in the country.<br> Are you really Robert?<br> I have to be sure, you know.<br> The sun... The sun<br> isn't warm anymore.<br> I don't want you to catch cold.<br> Here, darling. Put this around you.<br> I wouldn't mind having a cold or pneumonia<br> or anything I could understand.<br> What's the matter with me?<br> Is it a brain tumor?<br> - You've had a nervous breakdown.<br> - Nervous breakdown.<br> - That doesn't sound so bad, does it?<br> - Just takes time. That's all.<br> What else does it<br> do to you besides take time?<br> It's like any sickness, darling.<br> Dr. Kik'll make you well again.<br> Yes. He wants to help me.<br> Oh, may I light it myself, please?<br> Could you possibly let me<br> have some matches? To keep, I mean.<br> It's funny. They don't let us<br> have matches... as if we were children.<br> - They don't cost much, do they?<br> - I haven't got matches, but...<br> R.C. Robert Cunningham.<br> You are Robert.<br> - Hello, Kik. I was looking for you.<br> Did you get my note?<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, what do you think?<br> - What do I think, Dr. Gifford?<br> I think it's one of the worst things<br> that could happen to this patient.<br> Miss Seiffert, did you...<br> Thank you.<br> Miss Seiffert?<br> Oh, I beg your pardon.<br> Yes, Dr. Kik?<br> Miss Seiffert, did you tell Mr. Cunningham<br> there's a way of getting his wife released?<br> Indeed I did, Doctor.<br> It all happened the other day.<br> He mentioned that his mother owned a farm<br> in Illinois, and I told him I was sure...<br> there wouldn't be much trouble<br> getting his wife discharged<br> if he took her out of the state.<br> - Dr. Curtis agreed with me, and...<br> - Provided, of course, she<br> passes the staff examination.<br> Huh? Oh, of course!<br> Of course.<br> I don't get it.<br> What's wrong with that, Kik?<br> What's wrong is that<br> this patient isn't ready to go to staff...<br> to say nothing of being discharged from<br> the hospital, particularly to her husband.<br> - Why, is something the matter with him?<br> - No.<br> But the patient's main problem happens to<br> be a complete inability to accept his love...<br> or the love of any man<br> she could think of as a husband.<br> - Her rejection is something...<br> - Miss Primm, can't you see<br> the doctor hasn't finished yet?<br> All right.<br> You can take it.<br> What I'm trying to say, Dr. Gifford, is<br> that until the treatment Mrs. Cunningham...<br> is now getting brings out the causes of<br> her unconscious rejection and resolves them...<br> we can't send her to Illinois or any state<br> without the least chance of her getting well.<br> Now, now, Doctor. We're not trying to<br> minimize the importance of treatment.<br> Trouble is, for you, each case is the one,<br> and for us, it's one of thousands.<br> Yes, Curtis.<br> One of thousands, even millions...<br> but only by trying to make each case<br> the one can we really help the patient.<br> I happen to have here some<br> of the more recent statistics.<br> Oh, yes. Here they are. Sometimes<br> even we doctors must face reality.<br> Number of patients in reception building<br> six months ago... 537.<br> Originally,<br> it was designed for 312 patients.<br> Today, the number of patients<br> in the same building: 718.<br> This morning, we were asked<br> to admit 43 new cases. Care to<br> hear how many we could take?<br> - Sixteen.<br> - And those, only by putting more mattresses<br> in some of the day rooms.<br> Yes, Kik. We don't have enough bed space.<br> We don't have enough beds or sheets.<br> We haven't got enough<br> of anything but patients. Miss Seiffert?<br> - Uh, yes, Dr. Gifford?<br> - I want you to continue the investigation...<br> of this patient's release<br> and report directly to me.<br> - Curtis, will you come with me? Miss Primm?<br> - Yes?<br> - Send some coffee to my office.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> - Good day.<br> - Good day, Doctor.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Doesn't give you much time, does it?<br> - No, it doesn't.<br> You see, Terry, I'm convinced there's something<br> quite recent in this woman's history...<br> that we know nothing about,<br> which I'm almost sure would lead<br> to the origins of her illness.<br> - If only I could get it out of her before...<br> - Before it's too late.<br> Yes. Well,<br> there's one more shortcut I can try.<br> Ninety-six, 95...<br> - Ninety-three.<br> - Ninety-three...<br> 92, 92...<br> - Ninety-one.<br> - Ninety-one...<br> 88...<br> Thoughts are coming<br> to your mind now.<br> You're going back.<br> You're thinking about Chicago.<br> Chicago. Concert.<br> You're in Chicago.<br> You're going to a concert with Robert.<br> Suddenly you decide<br> you can't go.<br> Concert. Chicago.<br> Yes. I left the bar.<br> Robert tried to stop me,<br> but it was late. It was late.<br> - Robert,<br> I can't go to the concert.<br> - What?<br> - I'm sorry. I was trying<br> to tell you all afternoon.<br> - Virginia, wait a minute.<br> - What is this? What's it all about?<br> - It's no use. Robert, I'm sorry.<br> I've got to go right away.<br> Let me go. Please! Let me go. Let me go.<br> Please let me go.<br> I have to hurry. It's late!<br> - Go on. Where are you going now?<br> - I only have a few minutes.<br> There's a train at 5:00.<br> - I've got<br> to be ready. I have to be ready.<br> It's 6... 30.<br> Where are you going?<br> - He'll tie it for me.<br> - Who will tie it for you?<br> I'm coming!<br> I'm coming!<br> Hello. I'm ready, Gordon.<br> I hope... I hope I'm not too late.<br> - Gordon?<br> - Yes. He hates to be kept waiting.<br> - All right. Go on.<br> - I tried not to go with him, but I had to.<br> Last Sunday, I tried. I'm going to Chicago<br> next Sunday, Gordon. There's a concert.<br> Oh, but you know, Gordon.<br> He said it was the annual banquet May 12.<br> Gordon, please,<br> couldn't you go without me?<br> L... But he... Oh, he...<br> - He said you must be ready by 6:30, Virginia?<br> - Yes.<br> I had to. I had to.<br> - You liked doing what Gordon told you?<br> - Oh, I don't know.<br> Yes, I thought I owed it to him. He took<br> such good care of his mother and sister.<br> Janey said<br> he was like a father to them.<br> Was Gordon the first one<br> you cared for after your father died?<br> Yes. I was writing all the time.<br> I wanted to become a writer.<br> And before that, in school,<br> did you go out with boys?<br> Oh, no. I had to study. Gordon was the only<br> one. He seemed to know what was best.<br> He always tied the bow<br> in my hair.<br> - Gordon?<br> - Oh, no. My father.<br> Tell me about your father.<br> - I was ready, just<br> as Gordon said, at 6:30 sharp.<br> - Go on.<br> - You remember it now.<br> - Yes. Yes, I do.<br> Hello. I'm ready, Gordon.<br> I hope... I hope I'm not too late.<br> Ready? Not quite.<br> - Oh, I am sorry.<br> - I'm afraid you'll never change.<br> There. You look rather pretty tonight,<br> Virginia.<br> Well, we'd better be going. It's<br> a long drive, and I don't like to be late.<br> Go on. What happened then?<br> - I don't remember.<br> - You're in Gordon's car.<br> Yes. Yes.<br> Gordon's car.<br> You know, for the first time since I've<br> known you, you had me worried for a while.<br> Oh, I was sure you'd be there, butJaney<br> was trying to call you all day.<br> I'm sorry, Gordon.<br> I was out.<br> She and George Bennett<br> are going to be married in June.<br> Oh, I'm glad forJaney.<br> George is a nice boy.<br> You bet. So you see, honey.<br> Now I not only getJaney off my hands...<br> but George said he'd be glad<br> to pitch in and help with Mother.<br> Well, I decided...<br> I mean, this is as good a time as any.<br> We'll make it<br> a double wedding, huh?<br> I haven't got an engagement ring yet like<br> George, but we'll announce it at the dinner.<br> - You're shaking.<br> - It's nothing. I'll be all right.<br> - Virginia, are you sick?<br> - I don't know. I just feel...<br> - There's a drugstore about a mile up the road.<br> - I think I'd better go home.<br> - Virginia, what's the matter?<br> - Please, Gordon. Take me home.<br> You didn't want to marry him.<br> - Virginia, why?<br> - I was really sick. I couldn't help it.<br> Of course you couldn't. What happened then?<br> Gordon's taking you home.<br> I couldn't help it.<br> I couldn't. I couldn't.<br> Oh, he can't be dead! He can't be!<br> Oh, Gordon! If only I hadn't made him<br> turn back, he wouldn't have died!<br> You didn't make him turn back.<br> You were sick, and he was taking you home.<br> That's what anybody would've done.<br> It's only natural you felt a certain blame.<br> He died, and you didn't.<br> You're going to sleep now,<br> Mrs. Cunningham.<br> When you wake up, you'll<br> remember everything you told me.<br> Everything.<br> Let her sleep for a while<br> and then take her back to the ward.<br> And in addition to the foregoing...<br> the narcosynthesis<br> revealed the existence...<br> of earlier factors<br> in the patient's life...<br> directly connected with the root causes<br> of her present condition.<br> In view of this,<br> I'm sure you will agree...<br> that the patient should not be allowed<br> to leave the hospital...<br> at this time.<br> With a sincere hope that<br> you will take this matter...<br> into serious consideration...<br> and the usual ending.<br> Thank you. Will you see that Dr. Gifford<br> gets this as soon as possible?<br> Two chocolate and vanilla mix<br> and two coffees, please.<br> - Cream and sugar?<br> - One cream and sugar.<br> Two chocolate and vanilla mix,<br> two coffees, one cream and sugar.<br> Hiya, honey.<br> I hope you feel as good as I do today.<br> I wish Robert wouldn't leave me alone.<br> All these people probably looking at me,<br> thinking I'm one of the sick ones.<br> I won't let them scare me.<br> I wonder which is which.<br> If I can't tell,<br> maybe they can't tell about me.<br> Look at that one over there. Didn't know<br> they allowed that kind in the store.<br> It isn't nice.<br> They shouldn't laugh at us.<br> Watch me. I'm sitting<br> over there with my boyfriend.<br> I wanted to be sure. I was worried<br> you'd think my husband was him.<br> Well, here I am again.<br> Funny. I thought that tall, handsome man who<br> came to see her last week was her boyfriend.<br> This one doesn't look<br> like the real one. Or maybe l...<br> Question:<br> Dear Dr. Kik, when am I real?<br> Sorry, darling.<br> They don't seem to be in a hurry here.<br> - Half vanilla, half chocolate.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Cream and sugar.<br> - Nobody'd ever<br> think Robert belonged here...<br> whereas I always look rather...<br> - It isn't fair.<br> - What are you thinking of?<br> It's hard to say<br> what I'm thinking of ever.<br> I don't remember so many things,<br> and I forget even what I remember.<br> - It's such good ice cream.<br> - I'm glad. I have good news for you.<br> I'm pretty sure you'll be going with me<br> to my mother's soon.<br> - Your mother?<br> - Yes. To her farm. Where I was born.<br> - You remember.<br> - Oh, yes. Of course.<br> Everybody says you're so much better now.<br> The fresh air and rest and lots of good food.<br> - That's what you need most.<br> - Yes.<br> Sometimes I think I'm not<br> as sick as the others, but they<br> say if you think you're well...<br> then you're really sick.<br> If I say I'm sick,<br> maybe that means I'm well.<br> - The trouble is, I can't be sure of anything.<br> - You can be sure of one thing.<br> Of me.<br> Well, sweetie, I told you.<br> Everything's gonna be wonderful.<br> My husband has just agreed to give me<br> a divorce. That's the only reason I'm here.<br> Well, better not<br> keep the man waiting.<br> Now I don't know<br> who's mixed up.<br> I should've introduced you,<br> but I don't know her last name.<br> - And anyway, things seem different here.<br> - Yes, they do.<br> Like the other night... last night...<br> yes, I heard a scream...<br> and I didn't know if it was me<br> who screamed or not... if it was I or not.<br> When you start worrying about<br> your grammar, I know you're getting well.<br> Am I? For a while, they thought<br> Don Jackson was going to get well.<br> I knew him in Evanston.<br> When he was in law school...<br> he... he lost his mind,<br> and they took him away.<br> - At first, they thought he'd<br> get over it, but he never did.<br> - You shouldn't worry about Don.<br> I remember his mother<br> saying, "My real boy is dead.<br> He's happy there, in a world of his own,<br> with his own kind."<br> All right. You can have it.<br> - I hate him, and I hate you!<br> - Tommy, darling, wait a minute!<br> Now, now, Jane.<br> This doesn't concern you, dear.<br> With my own kind.<br> - Robert?<br> - What is it, dear?<br> - You must divorce me.<br> - Divorce you?<br> Yes. You must. It's not fair for you to be<br> tied to me. You should have your freedom.<br> My freedom? The few hours I can<br> spend here with you... that's my freedom.<br> - You're talking too fast. I can't follow you.<br> - Virginia, darling, I love you.<br> Yes. Did... Did Dr. Kik<br> say anything to you about Gordon?<br> - Gordon?<br> - Yes.<br> No, he didn't,<br> but it's all right.<br> Ohh.<br> - Sure you don't want it?<br> - Sure.<br> Virginia, I was going to tell you.<br> Dr. Gifford says you're going to staff.<br> Staff? Yes. I heard about it.<br> Where is that?<br> It's a group of doctors. They talk<br> to you a little before you go home.<br> - It's nothing to be afraid of.<br> - Does Dr. Kik know about it?<br> Dr. Gifford thinks<br> you're well enough to go to staff.<br> Only a little while ago,<br> Dr. Kik said it'd take time.<br> - He's my doctor, Robert.<br> - Sometimes I wonder if Dr...<br> I'm sure, dear, whatever they decide<br> about you will be with Dr. Kik's consent.<br> The important thing<br> is that you wanna go home with me.<br> - You do, Virginia, don't you?<br> - Yes, Robert. Yes.<br> Everybody wants<br> to go home from here.<br> - Virginia Cunningham!<br> - I passed. I'm going home.<br> - I'm going to see my baby.<br> - How do you know? They didn't tell me nothin'.<br> No. All they do is write things.<br> Every time you open your mouth,<br> they write something down.<br> I knew from the way Dr. Kik looked at me,<br> and then I heard Dr. Gifford say "recovered."<br> Virginia Cunningham?<br> Oh, here you are.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Funny the way they keep<br> changing the doors here.<br> - Good luck. I'm sure<br> you'll be all right, dear.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'd better smile. Careful.<br> This way.<br> Sit here.<br> - Who's next?<br> - Virginia Cunningham, Doctor.<br> - May I have her file?<br> - Yes, Doctor. Here it is.<br> Let's see. Curtis, is this the case<br> we discussed the other day?<br> Yes, Doctor.<br> - Give it to Dr. Kik.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> To Dr. Kik.<br> - Dr. Kik?<br> There's nothing to be afraid of.<br> - Go ahead, Dr. Kik.<br> Mrs. Cunningham, your husband<br> has applied for your discharge...<br> with the understanding that you're<br> to be released to his mother in Illinois.<br> - You know that, don't you?<br> - I don't get it.<br> Whatever they decide about you,<br> it'll be with Dr. Kik's consent.<br> I'm going to ask you a few questions.<br> Please try to answer the best you can.<br> - You understand?<br> - No, I don't.<br> The members of the hospital staff want<br> to find out if you're well enough to leave.<br> - Now, Mrs. Cunningham...<br> - Do you think I'm well enough?<br> - That's what we're trying to find out.<br> - You want to get rid of me?<br> - We're not trying to get rid<br> of you, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> But you won't catch me saying,<br> "I'm not sick." I know what that means.<br> Nobody's trying to catch you<br> at anything, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> If you don't mind, Dr. Kik, I think it would<br> be better if Dr. Curtis examined the patient.<br> May I have her file?<br> - Now, Virginia... That's your name, isn't it?<br> - If you know it, why ask me?<br> - I understand you wanna leave us.<br> - Yes. Oh, yes, I do.<br> The sooner the better. Now. Right away.<br> I'll do anything to get out of here.<br> That's good. Now, then, Virginia,<br> just relax and tell me.<br> - Where were you living when you became ill?<br> - New York.<br> - Where in New York?<br> - New York City.<br> - I mean, where in New York City?<br> - Manhattan.<br> - Yes?<br> - Yes?<br> - I mean, go on.<br> - Go on about what?<br> I'm trying to find out<br> your address in New York.<br> Oh, I knew all the time<br> that's what you meant, but I don't know.<br> Please, God.<br> Please help me.<br> I'm sure you know your own address.<br> Just think a moment.<br> I've forgotten it.<br> I never could remember figures.<br> - What street did you live on?<br> - Waverly. No.<br> Bleeker.<br> No. That was Helene Carter.<br> Or was itJennifer?<br> Hudson, maybe.<br> No, it wasn't Hudson.<br> I can't remember.<br> - Your husband's been here to see you?<br> - Yes.<br> - How often does he come here?<br> - As often as the rule allows.<br> - How often is that?<br> - Why? Don't you know?<br> I know. I know all about it.<br> I'm simply trying<br> to find out if you know.<br> I can't see what difference it makes.<br> Would you change the rules?<br> - Please, folks. Virginia,<br> will you please answer?<br> - It'll make it easier for all of us.<br> - I'm trying.<br> - What's your husband's occupation?<br> - He works for some publishers.<br> No. That was way back.<br> He's a farmer, isn't he?<br> - I thought he was an auditor.<br> - Oh, yes, yes. For the Alden Hotels.<br> - Alden Hotels?<br> - Yes.<br> - Isn't he working for the Kraft Hotels?<br> - No. He works for Alden Hotels.<br> I'm sure you'll recognize<br> your husband's handwriting. Go ahead.<br> - What do you see?<br> - I see that my husband has written...<br> that he's employed<br> by the Kraft Hotels, Incorporated.<br> - What do you say to that?<br> - If he says Kraft, it's Kraft.<br> I was mistaken. I'm sorry.<br> - L... I'm terribly sorry.<br> - There, there. Don't get<br> upset. You're doing all right.<br> I wonder how much more it'll take<br> to make them see how wrong they are.<br> - Now, let's see.<br> You ever worked yourself?<br> - Beg pardon?<br> - Have you... Have you ever worked yourself?<br> - Better. Thank you. I have.<br> - Yes?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm sorry. I know what you mean.<br> You want further information.<br> - What's that?<br> - My Social Security number.<br> You mean to say you remember a long number<br> like that, and you can't recall your address?<br> - Please don't do that.<br> - Now, look here, Virginia. I'm<br> trying to help you, understand?<br> If you'll just pay attention<br> to what I say and answer my questions.<br> That's what I'm trying to do. You see, you<br> don't expect to forget your home address.<br> So you memorized<br> your Social Security number instead, eh?<br> Once, I lost my card, and I couldn't<br> get a job until I got a new card.<br> And all because I didn't know the number.<br> It's important, you know.<br> - And your address isn't?<br> - Well, I don't suppose I'll have<br> to find my way back there alone.<br> All right. I'll give you an easy question.<br> I'm sure you can answer this one.<br> - How old are you? Come on.<br> - I feel sick.<br> - How old are you?<br> - Please don't shake your finger at me.<br> - Dr. Gifford, this must be<br> stopped before it's too late.<br> - Stop what?<br> - Come, now. Come. This is easy.<br> Take your finger away.<br> Please take it away.<br> Don't tell me you don't know your own age.<br> It's really a simple question.<br> Don't do that. Don't do that!<br> Come on. Stop it.<br> Get in there before l...<br> Please! Please!<br> Come on. Cut it out.<br> Nobody's gonna hurt ya.<br> Now, cut it out, I said.<br> You're waking everybody up.<br> - Hi, Dot. Everything okay?<br> - Oh, just dandy.<br> Well, how's it going today, society lady?<br> Here. I brought you a lovely supper.<br> Tomato juice cocktail.<br> - Make you feel like a million.<br> - Thank you. I don't care for any supper.<br> You'd better be careful. We had<br> a little "ouble-tray" with her this morning.<br> She "icks-kay"<br> and "ites-bay." Get it?<br> - Yeah. One minute,<br> completely "uts-nay," and the next...<br> - It isn't nice...<br> to call a person "uts-nay"<br> in this place.<br> - See what I mean?<br> - Well, how about it, society lady?<br> - My name's Cunningham, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> - I know. "Mrs. Cunningham."<br> - What's yours?<br> - Jones.<br> - Miss?<br> - Don't rub it in. Come on, now,<br> or you'll get it through a tube.<br> - I don't want any.<br> - All right, Nurse.<br> - May I have it?<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> I do wish you'd drink a little of this.<br> It'd make you feel much better.<br> I know your kind. Your voice is sweet,<br> but it drips with poison and lies.<br> - I know you and I hate you.<br> - I don't blame you for being angry...<br> but I want you to know that if<br> you need me and want to talk to me...<br> I'll be here.<br> Get away from there<br> before I report you.<br> - This is my place.<br> - Excuse me. I didn't know it was reserved.<br> Well, how many times do I have<br> to tell you? Or don't you remember?<br> Miss Green,<br> Virginia's on the rug!<br> You get off the rug,<br> Virginia Cunningham!<br> Come on! Come on!<br> Get off of there!<br> I've told you a dozen times,<br> we do not walk on our rug.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because we don't! Understand?<br> We're the only ward<br> that has a rug.<br> It's clean, and we mean<br> to keep it that way.<br> Why don't you<br> hang it on the wall?<br> Your wisecracks might have been appreciated<br> in other wards, but in 12 they don't go over.<br> - Is this 12?<br> - Well, what did you think it was? One?<br> - How long have I been here?<br> - Too long.<br> Now, just remember to keep your big feet<br> off that rug, and don't let me catch you again.<br> My big feet?<br> All right, ladies,<br> don't crowd.<br> - ##No gal maid has got a shade ##<br> - Emma!<br> - # Sweet Georgia Brown #<br> - Emma, you get off that rug!<br> #Two left feet, but, oh, so neat<br> is Sweet Georgia Brown #<br> - You get off this minute!<br> - Oh, do let her finish, please! She's good!<br> #You wanna know why<br> You know I don't lie #<br> # Not much, it's been said<br> she knocks 'em dead #<br> - Emma! Emma! Emma. Come on, Emma.<br> - #When she lands in town #<br> #When she came<br> It's a perfect shame when she mows 'em down ##<br> Miss Johnson, Virginia's<br> on the wrong side again.<br> Oh, I beg your pardon.<br> I didn't see the seating chart.<br> - Huh. Alibi Al.<br> - Over there, Virginia.<br> - Hello, hello, hello. Hello, Virginia.<br> - Hello.<br> Hello. Hell's low<br> and heaven's high.<br> That's what you think. If you know what I know,<br> you'd laugh on the other side of your face.<br> Not being two-faced like some people<br> I could mention, I say hello again.<br> - No talking, ladies.<br> - You see?<br> Now, now, Countess,<br> enough is enough.<br> - Save some for Virginia.<br> - Thank you. That's very kind.<br> Save some for Virginia.<br> Save some for Virginia.<br> Save some for Virginia.<br> Hey, nursey, nursey,<br> how about another cup of coffee?<br> Here you are.<br> - Food's awful here, anyway.<br> - Ah, you said it.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> I'm not too hungry.<br> Oh, that's a good girl. Dr. Kik will be<br> pleased that you're eating again.<br> I should have told you the Kraft people<br> bought out the Alden chain.<br> Besides, I never thought they'd<br> be asking you questions like that.<br> Oh, Robert, that man, he's dangerous.<br> He can't be left loose.<br> - Hello, Doctor.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> Why don't the nurses<br> do something?<br> That's the doctor I was talking to you<br> about the other day.<br> What did you say, dear? I was thinking<br> about that terrible little man.<br> - You mean Dr. Curtis?<br> - Curtis? Who's Dr. Curtis?<br> Thanks. The guy that<br> just went through the room.<br> He's head<br> of women's reception.<br> It must be me again.<br> I thought he was a patient.<br> But, Robert, I'm sure there's<br> something wrong with him.<br> Yesterday he came into our ward<br> and asked me why I bit his finger.<br> He must be crazy or something,<br> saying I bit him.<br> I never saw him before<br> in my life.<br> I think they better put him in one of those<br> tubs they're always threatening me with.<br> Robert, I didn't<br> bite him, did I?<br> Did I?<br> I guess you did.<br> Anyhow, that's his story.<br> - I don't understand. When?<br> - At the staff meeting.<br> - But, Robert, it isn't like me<br> to go around biting people.<br> - Forget it.<br> Anyhow, next time you want to bite<br> somebody, don't make it such a big shot.<br> I'm sorry. I know it isn't funny,<br> but I can't help laughing.<br> Is he such a big shot?<br> - He's over Kik, and Kik's<br> pretty important here.<br> - Did you say Kik?<br> Yes. As a matter of fact, I've been<br> wanting to talk to you about him.<br> - I wish you wouldn't.<br> - Viginia, it wasn't Kik who sent you to staff.<br> It was all my fault.<br> I was too anxious to get you<br> out of here. Kik told me I was.<br> As a matter of fact, he's the only one<br> who said you weren't ready...<br> the only one who tried to stop it,<br> but he was overruled.<br> - Good night, ladies.<br> - Good night, Miss Jenkins.<br> Good night,<br> Miss Jenkins.<br> What's the matter, honey?<br> Miss Jenkins!<br> Miss Jenkins, Virginia's sick!<br> Miss Jenkins,<br> Virginia's sick!<br> All right. I heard you<br> the first time.<br> Is it a sharp pain?<br> - Where?<br> - Here.<br> A little indigestion,<br> I guess. It'll pass.<br> Funny how it hurts<br> just in this one spot.<br> - Sorry. It's a little tender.<br> - Call Dr. Kik.<br> Tell him I think<br> it's appendicitis.<br> - Do you think you can walk?<br> - Yes, I guess so.<br> Come with me.<br> You know... You know, I begged<br> the nurse to let me put on a dress.<br> - Still in great pain?<br> - No, I feel much better now.<br> I promise not to tell<br> Miss Jenkins...<br> that your appendix was taken out<br> years ago on one condition...<br> that if you decide to grow another one,<br> you'll do it during the day.<br> I tried to see you this afternoon,<br> but I was afraid to tell the nurse why.<br> - And what is the reason?<br> - I know now that you didn't<br> really want to get rid of me.<br> Sit down,<br> Mrs. Cunningham.<br> Maybe I just imagine it now, but I think<br> somehow I knew I shouldn't leave the hospital.<br> I wanted to leave, and yet I didn't.<br> Does that make sense, Doctor?<br> Yes, it does. And the fact that<br> you realize it shows you're getting better.<br> - You really think I am?<br> - How would you like to be moved up to one?<br> One? But that's the best ward,<br> and they say the food's so good there.<br> I'd like to see you<br> gain weight.<br> Besides, they aren't so crowded, and we'd<br> have a better chance to have long talks.<br> Yes, Doctor.<br> Tell Miss Davis the patient<br> from five is here. Dr. Kik's patient.<br> This is your room.<br> You'll wait here<br> until Miss Davis comes.<br> May I sit on the bed?<br> I don't think I would.<br> Miss Davis wants everything just so.<br> I know how you feel, kid,<br> but don't be scared.<br> Just do everything Miss Davis says,<br> and you'll be all right.<br> - Don't think about it. Just do it.<br> - Is she the head nurse?<br> Yeah. She took over<br> when Miss Somerville...<br> Well, she's it now.<br> For the time being, anyway.<br> I think I heard Miss Davis's name before,<br> but maybe I just imagined it.<br> You see,<br> I keep forgetting things.<br> Well, you'll be all right,<br> or they wouldn't have put you in one.<br> Practically everybody<br> goes home from one.<br> Just keep in mind<br> what I told you.<br> In one, we don't sit on the floor.<br> You'd better get used to it right now.<br> I was afraid<br> I'd mess up the bed.<br> You'll find the rules here<br> different from the other wards.<br> Patients take care of their own rooms<br> and make up their own beds.<br> - Oh, I could never make a bed look like that.<br> - You'll learn.<br> You can go<br> to the day room now.<br> Our ladies don't eat between meals.<br> I'll put the candy with your things.<br> - Personal belongings are quite safe in one.<br> - This is my pocketbook.<br> The candy's quite gone.<br> I keep things in it I need.<br> You'll find this ward is quite pleasant...<br> for those who are willing to cooperate.<br> You know,<br> I remember you now.<br> It's nice here.<br> Quite a difference from the other wards.<br> - You know, I'm a pianist.<br> - I'm a writer.<br> - I said I was a pianist!<br> - Pardon me.<br> My name is Virginia.<br> What are you doing?<br> Dolls. Cute?<br> - Oh, very cute.<br> - I make them all the time.<br> May I have one of them<br> for a minute?<br> - It'll be a cigarette.<br> - Sure.<br> You can have it for keeps<br> for five of'em.<br> All right.<br> Thanks.<br> Now, now, ladies, there's no hurry.<br> You'll all get them lit.<br> Now, Dorothy,<br> wait a minute. There.<br> That's better.<br> Say, I thought it over.<br> I want 10 more. It's really worth it.<br> Here, take the whole pack.<br> Well, thank you.<br> Good afternoon, my dear.<br> I don't think I've had the pleasure<br> of seeing you here before.<br> I'm Virginia Cunningham.<br> I came from five.<br> Nobody comes to one<br> from five.<br> Even I had to spend a few days in two<br> before coming here.<br> - And I, my dear, have money.<br> - That must be convenient.<br> My husband, Mr. Greer,<br> is very wealthy.<br> I have more jewels<br> than I can possibly wear.<br> You, of course,<br> are a charity patient?<br> Oh, no.<br> It so happens that my husband,<br> Mr. Cunningham, is very wealthy.<br> My diamonds<br> simply weigh me down.<br> I have the Hope diamond.<br> I have the Hopeless emerald.<br> It carries the Cunningham curse.<br> You've probably read about it.<br> - Mr. Greer...<br> - Your husband?<br> Mr. Greer, my husband,<br> considered buying it, but it has a flaw.<br> You see, you can't<br> put an imperfect stone...<br> on the most beautiful<br> hands in the world.<br> That's why, my dear, I don't<br> do menial work like the rest of them here.<br> You mean occupational therapy?<br> It's supposed to be good for you.<br> You're quite wrong, my dear.<br> It isn't good for me.<br> I didn't mean you. I meant the "you"<br> one substitutes for "one."<br> - The general "you."<br> - General who?<br> Oh, Pershing.<br> Oh.<br> Cousin of mine.<br> One of the minor branches<br> of the family.<br> Virginia.! Virginia,<br> where did you get that doll?<br> Valerie gave it to me.<br> Why?<br> Give it back to her this minute.<br> The ladies here don't steal.<br> I didn't steal it! It's mine now.<br> I gave her cigarettes for it.<br> Virginia, will you do as I say!<br> Will you give it to me?<br> No. I won't give it.<br> Why should I?<br> All right. Miss Bixby,<br> bring her to my office.<br> Come, Valerie.<br> Thanks, Miss Davis.<br> Are you a good mother?<br> But I'm not a mother.<br> I never had a baby.<br> - Did you want to have one?<br> - Every woman wants to have one, I guess.<br> Oh, yes, I remember once<br> when I was little...<br> You do believe me, Dr. Kik, don't you?<br> I didn't steal it. Really, I didn't.<br> I know you didn't. But why get so upset<br> about a little rag doll?<br> Oh, I'm not upset. I tried so hard to<br> keep my promise, not make any trouble here.<br> I ate all I could today<br> to gain weight, and...<br> I know you want me to stay in this ward,<br> but it wasn't my fault.<br> - Really, it wasn't.<br> - Then why didn't you just give the doll back?<br> All right, go on! Take her part, just<br> like Father, and then getting angry with me!<br> Oh, Miss Bixby, Mrs. Cunningham<br> can keep the doll. It's hers.<br> - Will you please tell Miss Davis?<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> - See you tomorrow morning at the usual time?<br> - Yes, Dr. Kik. 10:30.<br> You told me yesterday that<br> once when you were a child...<br> your father was angry<br> at you, quite unjustly.<br> Oh, that. It was nothing.<br> It all happened<br> because of a little doll.<br> It belonged toJane.<br> Yes, they called herJaney then.<br> She was my friend next door.<br> It was her doll.<br> Mother was very upset.<br> She told...<br> Oh, I know! I exchanged it for a big doll<br> that Mother had given me for Christmas.<br> I wish I could remember why.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Virginia. Virginia,<br> didn't I tell you an hour ago...<br> to take that doll home to<br> Janey's and bring back yours?<br> But, Mommy, this is<br> little like a real baby...<br> like the one<br> you're going to have.<br> I wish I knew why you always<br> take such pleasure in annoying your mother.<br> Will you please<br> do as I tell you?<br> Oh, all right. I suppose there's nothing<br> to do but let your father handle it.<br> Father? Oh, no!<br> Don't tell Father!<br> Mommy, please don't!<br> Please!<br> I don't care! Go ahead! Tell him!<br> Daddy'll let me keep you.<br> He won't make me<br> take you back.<br> He loves me.<br> Your father loved you<br> very much, didn't he?<br> Oh, yes. I remember<br> when I was even smaller...<br> Up and down you go.<br> Hi, hi, hi, hi.<br> Try and win a big, beautiful prize.<br> Ten shots for a nickel.!<br> Win a big, beautiful prize!<br> Ten shots for a nickel!<br> Not a quarter, not a dime...<br> Hey, the man gets a perfect score.<br> - One hundred percent.<br> Do you wanna go another round?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - What do we get for all these?<br> - You can have your choice...<br> of anything here<br> on the top shelf.<br> - Which one do you want?<br> - That one. The little soldier.<br> - That's the one I want.<br> - This one?<br> - Yes.<br> - Here you are, little girl.<br> - They start going for a uniform<br> early, don't they?<br> - Certainly do.<br> Oh, Daddy, it looks like<br> you in the picture.<br> Here, darling,<br> let me fix your hair.<br> You love me, don't you, Daddy?<br> You love me more than Mommy does.<br> Don't be silly.<br> We love you both the same.<br> You loved your father, didn't you?<br> Oh, yes, very much.<br> Except when...<br> when he took Mother's part.<br> Like when he wanted me<br> to give the baby back toJaney.<br> Virginia, how many times did I tell you<br> to be nice to your mother, now?<br> You're going to have<br> a little sister pretty soon.<br> That's why Mother's sick<br> and nervous these days.<br> She's just sick so you'll<br> be nicer to her, that's all.<br> You wanted<br> to have a baby of your own...<br> so your father would be as nice<br> to you as he was to your mother?<br> He was nice to me always,<br> until Mother told him about her baby.<br> You take that doll back toJaney<br> and bring Queenie home.<br> Sometimes it's hard<br> for children to love their father, isn't it?<br> Yes, but he couldn't<br> make me love Queenie.<br> I really don't know<br> what to do with that child.<br> - Virginia, will you please eat your dinner?<br> - I'm not hungry.<br> It scares me how she's getting to be more<br> and more like my sister Annie...<br> always thinking<br> everything turns around her.<br> And Father let her get away with it, just<br> because she was the baby of the family.<br> Oh, don't worry.<br> I know what I'm doing.<br> It's high time she realized she isn't<br> going to be the only child in the family.<br> - Virginia, please, will you eat your dinner?<br> - No.<br> Then go on up to your room, and you're<br> going to stay there until you do eat it.<br> Go on.<br> I don't know why, but she just<br> makes me so nervous lately. L...<br> Virginia, you know<br> that that's no place to leave your doll.<br> Virginia, take your doll<br> as your mother told you.<br> I will just sit here, and she<br> can't never make me do anything.<br> And I will not eat,<br> and I'll get thin like nothing.<br> And then I'll run away, and they can't<br> find me because I won't be there.<br> And he'll be sorry,<br> and he'll cry.<br> And I won't let him<br> love me anymore...<br> because I don't care.<br> Yeah, I don't care<br> if he hates me.<br> I don't care because<br> I just don't care about him anymore.<br> I hope you'll break to pieces<br> and they bury you...<br> so I'll never<br> have to see you ever...<br> ever again!<br> Then what happened?<br> I don't know. Nothing. Nothing.!<br> Why are you crying?<br> The doctor came.<br> Who was sick?<br> It was Father. Ohh...<br> Wishes sometimes seem<br> to come true, don't they?<br> But I didn't want him to die.!<br> I didn't.! I loved him so.!<br> But you're not going away,<br> Mommy, are you?<br> You'll love me, please,<br> won't you?<br> But my mother got married<br> soon afterwards...<br> and somehow I always felt she didn't<br> like me because I reminded her of Father.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's silly, isn't it? Crying about something<br> that happened such a long time ago...<br> something<br> I can hardly remember.<br> I don't think it is at all.<br> A little crying sometimes helps a lot.<br> I suppose so.<br> May I go, Doctor?<br> Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.<br> Mrs. Cunningham...<br> did your mother ever tell you<br> what your father died of?<br> I think she said...<br> Is it called uremia?<br> A very serious illness, which<br> usually takes many years to develop.<br> Oh.<br> Well, tomorrow then,<br> Mrs. Cunningham.<br> Yes, Dr. Kik.<br> Why, it's only a piece of rag.<br> Just a simple piece of rag.<br> - The doctor says you may<br> write for an hour each day.<br> - Why?<br> I understand you're a writer.<br> Isn't that what they do?<br> You will use the machine<br> only during rest hour.<br> I suppose you'll<br> make a great racket.<br> I don't want to bother anybody.<br> I don't have to write.<br> Dr. Kik says you're to write.<br> There'll be no argument, please.<br> Well, go ahead.<br> Might as well start right now.<br> What shall I write about?<br> How should I know?<br> You're supposed to be the writer.<br> What's the matter?<br> Go ahead.<br> I'm sorry. I can't write when people<br> are watching me. I never could.<br> Look, Virginia... and I say this<br> only for your own good...<br> being a writer is nothing<br> to be so excited about.<br> It doesn't set you above<br> the other ladies, you know.<br> - If you really were a writer...<br> - Do I tell you how to be a nurse?<br> All right, lady, I've tried<br> to be patient with you...<br> but you just haven't<br> any spirit of cooperation.<br> All you have is an exalted idea<br> of your own importance.<br> If it weren't for Dr. Kik,<br> you'd never be here.<br> I know now<br> why you hate me so.<br> It's because you're in love<br> with Dr. Kik, that's why.<br> Miss Davis! Wait a minute!<br> Please, Miss Davis.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean<br> what I said. Really, I didn't.<br> Please forgive me! Please!<br> Don't tell Dr. Kik about it!<br> Get back to your room!<br> Miss Davis, please, please!<br> Well, well, well.<br> We'll miss you, my dear.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - What do I mean?<br> You'll be out of here, I'd say,<br> in about 10 minutes, maybe less.<br> No, she can't send me away!<br> I must stay here! I promised Dr. Kik!<br> Miss Davis here?<br> - Miss Bixby.<br> - Yes, Miss Davis?<br> Bring Virginia here.<br> - Anybody seen Virginia?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - Where is she?<br> - Find her yourself.<br> Virginia.!<br> Miss Davis,<br> Virginia isn't anywhere in the ward.<br> Of course she is.<br> She must be hiding somewhere.<br> - Virginia.!<br> - Virginia.! Virginia.!<br> I can't find her anywhere, Miss Davis.<br> I can't imagine where she could be.<br> Ridiculous.<br> She couldn't get out of the ward.<br> I'll find her myself.<br> I know all their tricks.<br> Virginia, we know you're in there.<br> Unlock that door and come out at once.!<br> Call an attendant.<br> Virginia, you know you can't get away<br> with this. We'll break down the door.<br> I won't come out! I won't come out<br> until you send for Dr. Kik!<br> Dr. Kik is away,<br> but your husband is here.<br> - Robert?<br> - Yes.<br> I don't believe it.<br> It isn't visiting day.<br> We sent for him.<br> He's waiting in the hall.<br> Perhaps they notified him<br> as soon as I was missing.<br> He could've<br> gotten here by now.<br> Are you coming out<br> or not?<br> Where... Where is he?<br> No! Robert!<br> Where is he? Robert!<br> Where are you!<br> Robert, where are you!<br> Where are you! Wait!<br> No! No! No, no!<br> No! Oh, they were lying to me!<br> You're liars!<br> Liars! Liars!<br> You're all liars! Liars!<br> Good afternoon, Dr. Kik.<br> May I help you?<br> Thank you.<br> Is Dr. Terry upstairs?<br> He was a few minutes ago.<br> Oh, here he is.<br> - Oh, hello, Terry.<br> - Hello, Kik.<br> I'm glad you're back.<br> - How is she?<br> - She's not very good.<br> I tried my best to make them keep her in<br> reception, at least until you returned, but...<br> - I know. May I see her?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> Thank you.<br> She refused to talk<br> to anybody but you.<br> Later she started calling<br> for her husband again.<br> - I suppose you know what happened in one.<br> - I do.<br> - You say she was calling for her husband.<br> - Yes. I sent for him.<br> He talked to her<br> for a few minutes yesterday.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Thanks.<br> Look, Kik, if there's anything I can do<br> to help get her back into reception...<br> - just let me know.<br> - Thanks, Terry.<br> I'm patient 95312.<br> I've committed no crime.<br> I have no delusions<br> or hallucinations.<br> I demand to know why I'm being<br> kept here against my will.<br> I'm not guilty! I'm not guilty! They<br> tried to harm me and do away with me...<br> all because of $17 million!<br> Hello, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> Hello, Dr. Kik.<br> This is Dr. Terry,<br> Mrs. Cunningham. He's a friend.<br> Sorry, Doctor.<br> I guess I wasn't up to one.<br> - I tried, I really did,<br> but I just couldn't make it.<br> - It wasn't your fault.<br> Dr. Terry, do you mind<br> if we take this off?<br> - Miss Vance.<br> - But, Doctor, the instructions we got...<br> It's all right.<br> Oh, Doctor, why do I do those things?<br> I hate myself for it.<br> I don't want to do them,<br> but I can't help it. I just can't help it.<br> But you're still my doctor,<br> aren't you, Dr. Kik?<br> No, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> Dr. Terry's in charge of this ward.<br> But I'm sure he'll let me come<br> and see you whenever you need me.<br> Of course. Anytime.<br> We still have many things<br> to talk over.<br> He's not my doctor anymore?<br> What's going to happen to me?<br> Now, like I said, 17 females surrounded me.<br> "Don't shoot," I told them.<br> "No shooting around here."<br> But they wouldn't listen to me. I've<br> been chopped up. I've been ground up.<br> What am I talking about?<br> Come, come, Gertrude.<br> Come along, Gertrude.<br> - Well, this is it.<br> - What'd you say?<br> - Nothing. I was just talking to myself.<br> - A very bad habit.<br> You must be very sick.<br> Where'd you come from?<br> - One.<br> - One? Well, they bring you here<br> if you don't go home in a year.<br> - I hadn't been there a year.<br> - Sometimes they know sooner.<br> - Your name, please?<br> - Virginia Stuart Cunningham.<br> I'm Miss Somerville.<br> I keep the record.<br> I'm sure I haven't taken<br> your temperature today yet.<br> Normal. Thank you.<br> Miss Somerville?<br> Wasn't she the head nurse<br> in one before I was there?<br> Whatever she was,<br> she ain't anymore.<br> Very sick, you know.<br> Hester, let me go!<br> I won't do it again, I promise!<br> Let me go! Let me go!<br> Oh, Miss Vance!<br> Serves you right. I warned you<br> to leave Hester alone.<br> You gotta be careful with her.<br> Very sick, you know.<br> She don't talk, and she don't like nobody<br> she don't know, and she don't know nobody.<br> She fights 'em.<br> Hey, where you goin'?<br> Hello. I know how<br> you feel, Hester.<br> I used to feel like that too.<br> I'd like to be your friend.<br> Won't you let me<br> be your friend?<br> I'm the first lady of the land.<br> I have a right to cover my face.<br> I'm the first lady of the land. Nobody<br> can stop me from covering my face.<br> I'm the first lady of the land.<br> Do you know why Hester<br> didn't want to talk to me?<br> She thinks I'm just a dame like<br> all the rest of them. I'll bet you do too.<br> You all think you're more decent<br> than I am. I come from a good family!<br> You can't prove that I'm one of them!<br> You can't! You can't!<br> You can't prove that I'm one of them.!<br> You can't.! You can't.! You can't.!<br> - # Blong, blong, blong, blong<br> Blong, blong, blong #<br> I'm talking to you as<br> a representative of authority.<br> Because if they could get Molly out of here,<br> August 20, 1943, she would give them $10,000.<br> But they must investigate the case<br> to the nth degree and make a report on it.<br> I believe I can prove to them that I was<br> never insane. I had no bad habits of any kind.<br> And I'm willing to cooperate. They<br> can ask me any questions they wish...<br> and broadcast my answers<br> all over the world.!<br> It was strange.<br> Here I was among all those people...<br> and at the same time I felt as if I were<br> looking at them from someplace far away.<br> The whole place seemed to me<br> like a deep hole...<br> and the people down in it<br> like strange animals...<br> like...like snakes...<br> and I'd been thrown into it.<br> Yes. As though... As though<br> I were in a snake pit.<br> A snake pit?<br> Later... weeks later...<br> I understood.<br> I remembered once reading<br> in a book that long ago...<br> they used to put insane people<br> into pits full of snakes.<br> I think they figured that something which<br> might drive a normal person insane...<br> might shock an insane person<br> back into sanity.<br> - Did you ever hear of that?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, it was just as though<br> they'd thrown me into a snake pit...<br> and I was shocked into thinking<br> that maybe I wasn't as sick as the others...<br> that I really might get well.<br> You are getting well.<br> I hope so. But why, Doctor?<br> Why am I getting well?<br> Is it because I'm supposed<br> to know why I got sick?<br> - Do you?<br> - Well, I know what you think.<br> It's because of what happened to me years<br> ago... like that doll when I was a little girl.<br> Well, not quite.<br> You didn't get sick<br> only because of the doll.<br> Was it because my father and mother<br> were so angry with me?<br> In a way, yes.<br> Look, it all starts<br> long before you can even talk.<br> It may have started<br> when you were a few weeks old.<br> You may have been hungry...<br> and too often your mother wasn't<br> there to feed you on time.<br> Then later, still long before<br> the doll incident...<br> you wanted very much<br> for her to love you.<br> It wasn't your fault,<br> but you didn't get that love.<br> Virginia, darling, I've already<br> kissed you good night. Now, go to sleep.<br> That made you turn<br> to your father.<br> And when he took your<br> mother's side against you...<br> you felt betrayed and unloved.<br> When children feel that way,<br> they get very angry.<br> Often, they want to eliminate the person<br> they feel doesn't love them.<br> You mean I wanted my father to die?<br> No, but unconsciously<br> you did want to get rid ofhim.<br> In a sense,<br> that doll was your father.<br> Then when he got sick and died, you<br> couldn't cope with this sense of guilt.<br> And so you began to bury the memory of<br> what had happened in your unconscious.<br> You pushed it down<br> deeper and deeper.<br> The years added layers<br> to cover it up...<br> but it was still there<br> and made you hurt yourself.<br> What did I do?<br> For example, you didn't<br> go out with boys.<br> The reason you gave was that you<br> were working, trying to become a writer.<br> Actually, you avoided them because you<br> were devoted to the memory of your father.<br> But I did go out<br> with Gordon.<br> That was rather like trying<br> to bring your father back, wasn't it?<br> Gordon was very like<br> your father in some ways.<br> He was head of a family,<br> wasn't he?<br> All right, Mother.<br> Virginia, you sit here.<br> Janey, stop fidgeting!<br> He was firm,<br> commanding, and you liked it.<br> Hurry, Virginia! You should know<br> by now I don't like being late.<br> Your father was punctual<br> and meticulous. So was Gordon.<br> - Don't forget... 6:30 sharp.<br> - Yes, Gordon. I won't forget.<br> Sometimes<br> I felt like a child with Gordon...<br> but I thought<br> I really loved him then.<br> When he asked you to marry him,<br> something deep in you rebelled.<br> Well, l... I just got sick.<br> It wasn't that I didn't<br> want to marry him. I did.<br> Consciously. But your getting ill...<br> was the physical expression of your<br> unconscious feeling that you didn't.<br> Even before you saw that truck,<br> you wanted to get rid of Gordon.<br> And you blamed yourself<br> for Gordon's death...<br> just as you blamed<br> yourself for your father's.<br> It's horrible, isn't it?<br> Again you needed love<br> and protection...<br> so you went to New York,<br> to Robert.<br> Robert? You said Gordon<br> was like Father. But Robert?<br> Wasn't he<br> like the other side of your father?<br> Yes, he was kind and<br> thoughtful. He sort of took care of me.<br> The way your father did?<br> Yes. But why,<br> after I was married to Robert...<br> why did I want<br> to run away from him?<br> I remember wanting to,<br> just before I got sick.<br> Because you were<br> going back to your original pattern.<br> You couldn't face<br> being married to Robert...<br> just as you had been unable<br> to face marriage with Gordon.<br> Yes, l...<br> I felt it was wrong somehow.<br> I felt like a child again.<br> Mrs. Cunningham, sometimes<br> children are afraid to grow up...<br> because they can't let go<br> of the love they felt for their fathers.<br> But they can't remain<br> with their fathers.<br> They do grow up, and...<br> and they do marry...<br> because they learn that husbands<br> and fathers can't be the same thing.<br> What did you say?<br> I said that husbands and fathers<br> can't be the same thing.<br> - Can they?<br> - No, they can't.<br> - It's funny.<br> - What is it?<br> Everything you've said<br> seems to make sense.<br> I feel as though<br> I know it... here.<br> But you don't quite<br> understand it all here?<br> It doesn't matter. You may never know<br> why everything happened...<br> but now you do know how and where<br> it started, and that does matter.<br> Look. It's as though<br> you were in a dark room...<br> like this one.<br> Now, and you wanted<br> to turn on the light...<br> but you couldn't because<br> you didn't know where the switch was.<br> Now you do.<br> You may never know why turning<br> that switch makes the light go on.<br> But you don't have to.<br> As long as you know where it is...<br> you don't ever have to be afraid<br> of being in the dark again.<br> And that, I'm sure,<br> you'll be able to do very soon.<br> Come along, ladies!<br> Keep going. Keep going.<br> Take a seat<br> right down there.<br> Hold it a second, will you?<br> For the benefit of those<br> of you who are new here...<br> and for those who might<br> have forgotten the rules...<br> I'm warning you that nobody<br> is allowed to dance...<br> with the same person<br> more than three times.<br> Jitterbugging is out.<br> No cheek-to-cheek stuff. Understand?<br> That's what you say.<br> No cheek-to-cheek stuff.<br> See? Over there. She's the one<br> I was talking to you about.<br> Watch me.<br> - Oh.<br> May I have some, per fervore.<br> Is he the one?<br> He certainly goes for your kind.<br> Don't you say "my kind."<br> You just remember where I came from.<br> Quiet, ladies, please.<br> Quiet!<br> Got a cigarette?<br> Here.<br> Hey, I thought you said one! Two's<br> all I have left for the whole evening.<br> My, you've<br> certainly changed.<br> They could let a girl light<br> her own cigarette, at least at a dance.<br> We ain't gonna<br> burn the place down.<br> It's just to prove to us<br> that we're still sick.<br> You know, I'd like to see you when<br> you really are you. I mean, your kind.<br> - My kind?<br> - Yes. I'm sorry.<br> Don't be sorry, because I'm<br> not what you think I am.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Hey, kid,<br> just take it easy.<br> Forgive me. Sometimes I just like to nestle<br> on somebody's shoulder to get myself balanced.<br> Well, I hope this is<br> the last time I'll see you here!<br> Who's she?<br> Hello, hello, hello. Hello, Cecilia.<br> Look, I may be nutty,<br> but I'm not that nutty.<br> Oh, pardon me. I hope<br> I don't have to see you again next time.<br> Hey, girlie,<br> how about a dance?<br> No, thank you.<br> I don't dance.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Don't be shy.<br> Go ahead, Virginia.<br> Dance with the gentleman.<br> I won't be long, Hester.<br> Do you mind if we dance<br> on that side?<br> - There's a friend I'd like to watch.<br> - Okay.<br> You're a gorgeous dancer,<br> even if I say it myself.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Oh, you're welcome.<br> That was very nice.<br> Thank you.<br> Are you all right, Hester?<br> I didn't really want to dance.<br> - May I have the next one, ma'am?<br> - Sure, kid. Sure.<br> That one<br> must be really sick.<br> Likes to nestle<br> on my shoulder.<br> - Good evening, Doctor.<br> - Good evening, Miss Sherman.<br> Doctor, could I<br> have a parole?<br> Go on and enjoy the dance.<br> We'll talk about it tomorrow.<br> - Hello, hello, hello. Hello, Doctor.<br> - How are you, Miss Newman?<br> - Enjoying yourself?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> May I, madame?<br> Come on.<br> You know the rules. I've already<br> danced with you, three times.<br> What are you talking about? The dance<br> has just started. We danced only two times.<br> - Three times.<br> - Are you sure?<br> Absolutely.<br> Maybe I am crazy.<br> What about you?<br> Come on. Let's dance.<br> You're all right, Hester. Nobody's<br> going to hurt you. I won't let them.<br> Don't you remember?<br> What do you want to say, Hester?<br> Don't be afraid. Say it.<br> When I first came to the hospital,<br> I was just like you.<br> I guess I'd still be the same way<br> if it hadn't been for...<br> someone who kept talking to me<br> and made me feel I wasn't alone.<br> - Anything wrong?<br> - No, Miss Vance. Everything's all right.<br> - Hello, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> - Hello, Doctor.<br> - Having a good time?<br> - Oh, yes, Doctor.<br> - I got it all figured out.<br> - Sorry, but l...<br> I promised this dance<br> to somebody else.<br> To him? Hmm.<br> You'll be sorry.<br> Well, go ahead.<br> I'll take the next one.<br> Well, what are you<br> waitin' for? Go ahead.<br> I hate to be a nuisance,<br> but could we stay close to Hester?<br> They tell me you're the first one<br> Hester's ever let come near her.<br> - Becoming quite a doctor, aren't you?<br> - Oh, no.<br> It's just that<br> sometimes a sick animal...<br> knows better how another<br> sick animal should be treated.<br> You know, Doctor,<br> it really isn't fair.<br> You know everything about me,<br> practically from the time I was born...<br> and I don't even know<br> your first name.<br> Miss Vance wasn't going to let<br> Hester come to the dance.<br> I promised<br> to keep an eye on her.<br> I'd like to know it now.<br> - What?<br> - Your first name.<br> - Mark.<br> - Mark. Are you married?<br> Oh, no. Can you imagine me sitting in front<br> of a fireplace with a lot of kids around?<br> - Any family? Brothers? Sisters?<br> - No.<br> Look, you may be getting well, but<br> not well enough to question your doctor.<br> I suppose<br> I am getting better.<br> Time doesn't pass as fast as it used to,<br> and then you get selfish again.<br> I mean, if you have three cigarettes,<br> you don't give away two.<br> Yeah. Some selfishness<br> is a good sign of sanity.<br> - And there's another thing.<br> - What is it?<br> I'd rather tell you<br> some other time.<br> Well, as long as you think you're<br> getting selfish, I've good news for you.<br> You're going to staff.<br> - Staff?<br> - Yes.<br> ##All the friends I knew ##<br> # Goin' home, goin' home #<br> # I'm a-goin' home #<br> # Quiet like some still day #<br> # I'm just goin' home #<br> # It's not far, just close by #<br> #Through an open door #<br> #Work all done, care laid by #<br> # Goin' to fear no more #<br> # Mother's there expectin' me #<br> # Father's waitin' too #<br> # Lots of folk #<br> # Gathered there #<br> #All the friends I knew #<br> #All the friends I knew #<br> # Goin' home, goin' home #<br> # I'm a-goin' home #<br> # Quiet like some still day #<br> # I'm a-goin' home #<br> # It's not far #<br> #Just close by #<br> #Through an open door #<br> #Work all done #<br> # Care laid by #<br> # Goin' to fear no more #<br> # Mother's there #<br> # Expectin' me #<br> # Father's waitin' too #<br> # Lots of folk #<br> # Gathered there #<br> #All the friends I knew #<br> ##All the friends I knew ##<br> # Home #<br> # Home #<br> # I'm goin' home ##<br> Am I? Am I going home?<br> Well, well, well. Quite a change<br> from the last time I saw you here...<br> when you knew your<br> Social Security number so well...<br> and took such a strong dislike<br> to Dr. Curtis's finger.<br> My Social Security number. 342... No.<br> 47... No, no. What is<br> my Social Security number?<br> So your husband applied for your release<br> again, eh? What are you thinking about?<br> I was thinking about<br> my Social Security number.<br> Oh, that. Don't worry. We all<br> know how well you remember it.<br> It's just that if you want to ask me<br> any other question, I'm sure I can answer it.<br> That's all right. I guess we have<br> enough information to take your word for it...<br> unless there are<br> any objections.<br> - Dr. Terry?<br> - No, Dr. Gifford. Unless Dr. Kik...<br> - No.<br> - Anybody else?<br> Yes, I would like to ask<br> a question, if I may.<br> - Go ahead, Doctor.<br> - According to this,<br> Virginia is one of the patients...<br> with whom Dr. Kik seems<br> to have achieved remarkable results...<br> by applying psychotherapy<br> almost exclusively.<br> Just to satisfy my own curiosity,<br> I'd like to ask her...<br> if she's aware now of<br> the origin of her illness.<br> Would you like<br> to answer that, Mrs. Cunningham?<br> Well, I'd have to be a doctor<br> to put it into the right words...<br> but I'm sure it wasn't<br> because of any one thing.<br> It was a lot of things,<br> and it started when...<br> when I was a child.<br> I don't know yet everything<br> that caused it, but I do know...<br> that I'll be able to see life and myself<br> differently than before I came here.<br> Virginia!<br> Oh, here you are.<br> Dr. Terry wants you...<br> Where you goin'? You're leavin' us.<br> - Who's leaving?<br> - Are you being transferred?<br> Oh, Mrs. Cunningham,<br> I've been looking for you all over.<br> I haven't got<br> your record for today.<br> - The patient's checking out.<br> She's leaving, Celia.<br> - That'll make room for another.<br> But they'll send us<br> more than one. They always do.<br> And we're so crowded already.<br> I just don't know where it's all gonna end!<br> I'll tell you where it's<br> gonna end, Miss Somerville.<br> When there are more sick ones than well ones,<br> the sick ones will lock the well ones up.<br> I'm not sure they'll like it. My key!<br> Where's my key? How can I let her out!<br> - Just draw a line through her name.<br> - I tried that. It doesn't work.<br> I know!<br> I'll erase it.<br> - There. There. That'll do it.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> All right, ladies.<br> Virginia must leave now.<br> I'll miss you. You sure<br> you ain't sick anymore?<br> - Ruth, take care of Hester, will you?<br> - Sure.<br> Miss Vance, may I say<br> good-bye to Hester?<br> Why, certainly. Now, now,<br> ladies, go about your business.<br> I wonder what kind<br> of business it is.<br> Good-bye, Hester. I'm leaving now,<br> but I'll come back to see you.<br> No, Hester. You know<br> you don't do that anymore.<br> Your doctor will talk to you. Don't<br> be afraid to talk, and you'll get well too.<br> Good-bye, Virginia.<br> Oh, Hester, you've talked!<br> I knew you would.<br> You're going to get well now.<br> I know you will.<br> Good-bye, Hester.<br> Good-bye, Dr. Terry.<br> Thanks for everything.<br> Your husband is waiting at the administration<br> building. Miss Vance will take you there.<br> - Good-bye, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> - This way, Virginia.<br> - Good-bye, Mrs. Cunningham.<br> - Dr. Kik.<br> Will you come to see us sometime...<br> Robert and me?<br> - Why, yes, of course.<br> - You never will.<br> But if ever you feel you want to talk<br> to me, you know where you can find me.<br> Good-bye and good luck.<br> Remember at the dance I was going to tell you<br> another reason for knowing I was getting well?<br> - Yes.<br> - It's that I'm not in love with you anymore.<br> You never really were,<br> Virginia.<br> Robert, what happened<br> to my wedding ring?<br> - I kept it for you.<br> - May I have it?<br> Sure. Here, darling.<br> Would you put it on<br> again, please?<br> It was a long time.<br> Okay. Say, folks,<br> the bus is leaving. Or don't you care?<br> Don't we care?<br> Come on, darling. We're going home.<br> Okay, Jerry,<br> take it away.<br>
