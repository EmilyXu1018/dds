                        Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than there are people of any kind living in the<br> United States?<br> That can't possibly be true.<br> It is true.<br> What would account for that?<br> Well first of all, a lot of people live<br> in China. But here's my question:<br> Question?<br> How do you distinguish yourself in a<br> population of people who all got 1600 on<br> their SAT's?<br> I didn't know they take SATs in China.<br> They dont,I wasn't talking about China anymore, I<br> was talking about here.<br> You got 1600?<br> Yes I can sing in a Acapella group. But I cant sing.<br> Does that mean that you actually got<br> nothing wrong?<br> Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar<br> PC.<br> Or you get into a final club.<br> Or you get into a final club, exactly.<br> You know from a womans perspective sometimes not being in an Accapella group can be a good thing.<br> This is serious.<br> Well I am admitting I do like guys who row crew.<br> I like guys who row crew.<br> Well I cant do that.<br> Im kidding.<br> Yes I<br> got nothing wrong on the test.<br> Have you ever tried?<br> I'm trying now.<br> To row crew?<br> To get into a final club. To row crew?<br> No. Are you, like-whatever--delusional?<br> Sometimes,<br> Sometimes, you say two things at once and I'm not sure which one we're aiming at.<br> But you've seen guys who row crew, right?<br> NO.<br> Okay, we1ltheyre bigger than me.<br> They're world class athletes. And a<br> second ago you said you like guys who row crew<br> crew so I assumed you'd met one.<br> I guess I meant I liked the idea of it.<br> The way a girl likes cowboys.<br> Okay.<br> Can we get something to eat.<br> would you rather talk about something<br> else?<br> No, it's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have missed a birthday.<br> There are more people in China with genius<br> IQ's than the entire population of-<br> The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt<br> punched the Pore.<br> Which one?<br> The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best.<br> I actually meant which Roosevelt.<br> Theodore.<br> Is it true they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party wth the next -----<br> You can see why its so important to get in.<br> Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into?<br> Why would you ask me that?<br> I was just asking.<br> None of them thats the point<br> Our freind Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oilfutures last sumer and<br> Eduardo wont come close to gettingin. the ability to makemoney doesn't impress anybody around here.<br> Must be nice.<br> He made $300,000 in a summer?<br> He likes meteorology.<br> I thought it was oil futures.<br> you can read the weather you can<br> predict the price of heating oil.<br> I think you asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance.<br> I what...<br> You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that's where I have the best chance.<br> The one that's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance.<br> You didnt ask which one was the best one, you asked me which one was the easiest.<br> I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was asking just to ask.<br> Mark, I'm not speaking in code.<br> Erica~<br> You're obsessed with the finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this who'll prescribe<br> some sort of medication. You don't care if side effects may include blindness,<br> Final clubs.<br> Final clubs.<br> and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.<br> Yes<br> there is.<br> Well you do-that was cryptic~so you do speak in code.<br> I didn't mean to be cryptic.<br> All I'm saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attentionof the clubs.<br> Why?<br> Because theyre exclusive. ' (beat) And fun and they lead to a better life.<br> You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the<br> Phoenix Club?<br> He was a member of the Porcellian and yes he did.<br> Well why dont you concentrate on being the best you, you can be.<br> Did you really just say that<br> I was kidding<br> Im just stating the fact that, does'nt make it any less.<br> I want to be straight forward and tell you that I think you should be a lot more supportive. If I get in I'll be taking you to the EVENTS and the Gatherings and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet .<br> You would do that for me?<br> Indeed<br> Okay I want to try and be straight forward with you and let you know that were not anymore<br> What is<br> Were not dating anymore, Im sorry<br> Is this a joke?<br> No, it's not.<br> You're breaking up with me?<br> You're going to introduce me to people I wouldn't normally get to meet? What the<br> fuck is that supposed to mean?<br> Settle down<br> What was it supposed to mean?<br> -Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy.<br> The door guy's name is Bobby. I haven't slept with the door guy, the door guy's a<br> friend of mine. He's a perfectly good class of people and what part of Long <br> Island are you fromWimbledon?<br> I'm going back to my dorm.<br> Wait is this true<br> Yes.<br> Then I apologize, okay?<br> I have to go...<br> Erica<br> Yes.<br> I'm sorry and I mean it..<br> I appreciate that butI have to study<br> You don't have to study. Let's just talk.<br> I can't.<br> Why?<br> Because it's expausting. Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.<br> All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so you're not likely to~currently I wasnt making acoment on your appearanceI was saying you<br> go to B.U. I was stating a fact thats all.<br> I have to go study.<br> You don't have to study.<br> Why do you keep saying I dont have to study<br> Because you go to B.U.!<br> Do you want to get some food?<br> I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.<br> And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat.<br> So were even.<br> I think we should just be friends.<br> I don't want to be friends.<br> I was being polite, I had no intention ofbeing friends with you.<br> Im under some pressure right now from my OS class.<br> If we could just order some food. I think we should<br> Listen. You're going to be a very succesful computer person. But you're going to go through life<br> thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want<br> you to know, from the bottom of my heart,that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole,<br> Erica Albrightls a bitch. You think<br> that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht or do you think it's because all B.U. girls are bitches?<br> For the record, she may look like a 34C but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret. She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.False advertising.<br> The truth is she has a nice face. I need to think of something to help me take my mind off her.<br> Easy enough, except I need an idea.<br> I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.<br> So what if it's not even 10PM and it's a Tuesday night?<br> The Kirkland facehook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.<br> Billy Olson's sitting here<br> and had the idea of putting some of the pictures next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter.<br> Good call Mr.Olson<br> Yea, it's on. I'm not gonna do the farm animals but I like the idea of comparing two people together. It gives the whole thing a very Turing feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosinga number to<br> represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot.com.<br> The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures.<br> Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook so I'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in.<br> Let<br> the hacking begin.<br> First up is Kirkland. They keep<br> everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration, so a little WGET magic is all that's necessary to ~download the entire Kirkland facebook.<br> Kids stuff.<br> Next is Elliot. They're also open but<br> with no indexes on Apache. I can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page.<br> Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me.<br> Excellent.<br> Moving right along.<br> Lowell has some security. They require a username/password combo and I'm going to go ahead and say they don't have access<br> to main fas user database, so they have no way of detecting an intrusion<br> Adams has no security but limits the number of results to 20 a page<br> All I have to is breakput the same script I used on Lowell and its done<br> Quincy has no online Facebook what a sham.<br> There is nothing I can do about that<br> Dunster is intense. Not only is there no public directory but there's no directory at all<br> You have to do searches and if your search returns more then 20 matches nothing gets returned<br> Once you do get results they dont link directly to the images, they link to a php that redirects or something<br> Weird<br> This maybe diffucult i,ll come back later.<br> Leverett is a little better. Its a lenghty search but you can do an empty search and gets links to pages with a precceding picture<br> Its slightly obnoxious that they let you view one picture at a time<br> And theres no way I am gonna go to 500 hundred pages, to download pics 1 at a time.<br> So its definitely necessary to break out the emacs and modify that perl script.<br> Done<br> What's going on?<br> Perfect timing. Eduardo's here and he's going to have the key ingredient.<br> Mark<br> What up,<br> You and Erica split up?<br> How did you know that?<br> It's on your blog.<br> Oh yeah.<br> Are you alright?<br> I need you.<br> I'm here for you.<br> No, I need the algorithm you used for the oil futures.<br> Are you okay?<br> We're ranking girls.<br> You mean other STUDENTS<br> Yeah<br> You think that's such a good idea?<br> I need the algorithm?<br> I need the algorithm?<br> Give eachgir1 a base rating of 1400. At any time "Girl A" has a rating R~a and<br> "Girl B" has e rating R-b.<br> When any two girls are matched up there's an expectation of which will win based on<br> their current rating.<br> Yeah<br> And Those expectations are expressed this way.<br> Let's write it.<br> The one on the left.<br> on the right.<br> the right.<br> Who should we send it to first?<br> Dwyer<br> Neal<br> Who are you gonna send it to?<br> Just a Couple of people. The question is, who are they gonna send it to?<br> Hey guys check this out<br> The one on the left.<br> These girls<br> Right or Left<br> Left<br> Right or Left<br> Thats my roommate.<br> ALL On the left.<br> This isnt funny<br> Right<br> Left<br> Left<br> All night he blogged about you<br> You dont want to read this.<br> Erica is this yours.<br> I stole it from a train.<br> Get the hell out of here.<br> Thats an awful lot of traffic.<br> You think maybe we should shut it down before we get into trouble.<br> Hello<br> Wait you say<br> At 4 in the morning<br> Well there is an unusual amount of traffic which occured.<br> Your saying its unusal for 4 in the morning.<br> No this would be unusuall for half time at the superbowl.<br> Alright<br> I gotta go in.<br> Whats going on.<br> The Harvard network is about to crash.<br> You dont think.<br> I do.<br> God saves us everybody.<br> Cant connect.<br> The network.<br> Unless this a coincidence I would think this is us.<br> Its not a coincidence.<br> O shit.<br> So your called in front of the add board.<br> Thats not what happened.<br> You were'nt called in front of the administartive board.<br> No I was back at the bar with Erica Albright<br> She said all that.<br> She said all that.That I said that stuff to her.<br> I was reading from the transcript of her deposition.<br> Why wold you even need to depose her.<br> Thats really for us to decide.<br> You think if I know she could make me look like a jerk I'll be more likely to<br> Mark dont.<br> Why dont we stretch our legs for a minute, can we do that.<br> Its been almost 3 hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time embarassing Mr.Zuckerburg with the girls testimony from the bar.<br> I am not embarassed, she just made alot of that up.<br> She was under Oath.<br> I guess that would be the first time someone lied under oath<br> They got 2200 hits within 2 hours.<br> Thousands<br> What<br> Those guys are really fast.<br> Is there anyway to make this a fair fight.<br> Jump out and swim.<br> We'd have to jump out and drown.<br> We are genectically identical we would stay in one place.<br> just row the damn boat.<br> You hear about this?<br> What<br> Two nightss ago, a sophomore choked the network with a laptop from kirkland.<br> At four am<br> He set up a website were we vote the hotness of female undergrads<br> What were we doing,that none of us heard about this<br> I do not know, 3 hour technical row before breakfast<br> full course load studying.<br> Another 3 hours in the tank then studying.<br> Im not sure how we missed it.<br> How much activity was on this thing.<br> Twenty-two thousand page requests.<br> Twenty-two thousand<br> This is half of facebook, 7 houses<br> He developed the site in 1 night and he did it while he was drunk.<br> Twenty-two thousand<br> How do you know he was drunk<br> He was blogging, while doing this.<br> Know what it think<br> Way ahead of you.<br> This is our guy.<br> Cameron Worth, WINKLEVOSS, Cameron spelt the usuall way.<br> Taylor WINKLEVOSS, Taylor spelt the usuall way.

good<br> You can go in now<br> Catherine, Ive got students now,<br> students<br> undergrads<br> dont know,from the looks of it they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers suit<br> Good morning<br> Good morning, sir<br> I'm Cameron Winklevoss, this is my brother Tyle<br> Are you here because?<br> I'm sorry sir, I thought you were reading the letter<br> read the letter<br> well<br> we came up with an idea for a website called "Harvard Connection"<br> we've since changed the name to CONNECTU<br> and Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and<br> I understand<br> and Im asking what you want me to do about it?<br> Well sir<br> In the HARVARD student handbook which is distributed to each freshman<br> Under the heading standars of conduct in the HARVARD comunity<br> it says the college expects all the students to be honest<br> and forthcoming in their dealings with members in the community<br> stundents are required to respect public and private ownership<br> and instances of theft, missappropriation<br> - Anne?<br> Yes sir?<br> punch me in the face, go ahead<br> or<br> or unauthorised use will result in<br> disciplinary action<br> including required withdrawl from the college<br> you memorised that instead of doing what<br> what my brother came and<br> I came here to ask you respectfully<br> Sir its against university rules to steal from other students<br> plain and simple<br> have you spoken to your housemaster<br> yes sir<br> and the housemaster made a recommendation to the AD BOARD but the ADBOARD wont hear us<br> have you tried dealing with the other student directly<br> Mr Zuckerburg hasnt been responding to any of our e-mails and phone calls for the last 2 weeks<br> he doesnt answer when we knock on his door at KIRKLAND<br> and the closest Ive come to dealing with him face to face<br> when I saw him on the quad and chased him through HARVARD SQUARE<br> chased him<br> I I I saw him and I know he saw me, I went after him<br> and he disapeaared<br> I dont see this as a universty issue<br> Of course its a a universty issue<br> theres a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both<br> you entered into a code of ethics with the university<br> im sorry president summersnot with each other<br> im sorry president summers what you just said makes no sense to me at all<br> Im devestated by that<br> What my brother means is<br> Mark Zuckerburg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer<br> that would be a universty issue<br> I dont know this office doent handle petty larceny<br> this isnt petty larceny<br> this idea is potentialy worth millions of dollars<br> millions<br> yes<br> you might just be letting your imaginations run away with you<br> sir<br> I honestly dont think your in any position to make that call<br> I was the US Treasury secretary<br> Im in some position to make that call<br> "Letting our imagnations run away with us "<br> Is exactly what we were told to do in your Freshaman address?<br> well then I would suggest that you let your imaginations<br> run away with you on a new project<br> you would<br> everyone at HARVARD is inventing something<br> HARVARD undergarduates believe that inventing a job is better then finding a job is better then finding a job<br> So I suggest again that the 2 of you come up with a new new project<br> I'm sorry, sir. But thats not the poin<br> Please<br> come right at the point<br> you dont have to be a intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong<br> your saying that I dont<br> of course I am not saying that sir<br> Im saying that<br> really<br> sir<br> Ann<br> how did I get this appointment<br> Colleagues of their father<br> Let me tell you something, Mr. Winkle Voss ,Mr WinkleVoss<br> since your on the subject of right and wrong<br> This action, this meeting<br> The 2 of you being here, is wrong<br> Its not worthy of Harvard,<br> Its not what Harvard saw in you<br> You dont get special treatment<br> We never asked ...<br> Wai ...Wai..start another project<br> Like were amking a diorama for a science fair<br> If you have a problem with that Mr WinkleVoss<br> We never asked for special treatment<br> The courts allways at your disposal<br> Is there anything else I can do for you<br> TY<br> Thank you very much for your time<br> OOPPPS<br> I broka a 335 year old door knob<br> Eduardo, spring break you and Mr Zuckerburg took a trip to Newe York<br> Yes<br> What was the purpose of the trip<br> Well as CFO<br> I set up some meetings with potential advertisers<br> who paid for the trip<br> It was paid for out of the thousand dollar account I set up a few months earlier<br> at this point your thousand dollars was the only money that had been put into the company<br> YES<br> How did you feel the meetings went<br> went terribly<br> why<br> Mark was asleep<br> I was not asleep<br> can I repharse my answer<br> I wish he was asleep<br> so were at 29 schools now with over 75000 members<br> People who go on the Facebook tend stay on longer then almost any other web site now heres the most impressive statistc<br> Excuse me one secound<br> What sound are you making, is that like a tick<br> Was'nt a tick<br> Was<br> Like throttle sound<br> Almost a gag reflex<br> What is this ... ...<br> There was 1 more meeting scheduled for the New York<br> YES<br> It was a dinner<br> It was setup through my girlfreind at the time<br> Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting<br> YES<br> VERY<br> Their not gonna card us here right<br> Look around<br> Dont be embarrsed<br> Tell him their not gonna card us<br> their not gonna card us<br> Mark<br> Are you gonna talk about adds again<br> Unless your the BALLET THEATRE of HARTFORD, the purpose of business is to make a profit<br> It is'nt a business yet<br> Thats tough.<br> Its not tough for me , Its my job<br> Never mind<br> He started Napster, when he was 19<br> He can be late<br> He is not a God<br> What is he?<br> Hes 25 minutes late<br> I think your just jealous<br> I honestly was'nt jealous<br> I was nervous<br> why<br> I did'nt know him at all<br> But I had done a search and asked around and he<br> He struck me as a kind of an....<br> WILDCARD<br> WHA<br> He crashed out of 2 pretty big Internet companies in spectacular fashion and hes got a reputation with drugs<br> He also founded the companies<br> We dont need him<br> Hes here<br> - Im Sean Parker<br> How do you do<br> You must be Eduardo<br> and Christy, and Mark<br> Nice to meet you<br> You guys dont have anything in front of you<br> no<br> TORI<br> HeY, baby boy<br> Could you bring out somethngs,<br> The laquered pork with that ginger confit<br> Tuna tartar , and the lobster claws, that'll get us started<br> Christie<br> what do you like to drink<br> An Appletini<br> great<br> From that point on it was a Shauathon<br> The question was what did you talk about<br> He took through his episode with NAPSTER<br> I did'nt want to spend my 20's as a professinal defender<br> Who knew that in the begining of 2003--<br> They tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties but I guess to them that was a little like<br> Selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas<br> So we said screw it<br> and declared bankruptcy<br> You made a name for yourself<br> And you are dry<br> TORY<br> and then he went on to his secound business venture<br> which was an online rolodex that he got thrown out of by his equity<br> and I wanted to do it nicely, I put on a tie and shined my shoes, but nobody wanted to take orders from a kid<br> So let me tell you what happened to a 20 year old the top of the DOT-COM<br> Im not a psychiatrist<br> We got that on the record<br> Your not a psychiatrist, but what<br> a psychiatrist, would say that he was paranoid<br> They hired private detective who followed me day and night<br> There were targets for high priced escorts<br> I cant prove it but I know they tapped my phone<br> So I figured Im gonna trip you up whos done all this<br> Private behaviour is a relic of times gone by<br> and somehow,someway you've managed to live your life like the DALI LAMA but<br> but make shit up because<br> they dont want you they want your idea<br> and they want you to say thank you while<br> excuse me<br> wipe your chin and walk away<br> what happened to you<br> and delusional<br> YES<br> WHA<br> There'll be payback in case I bought down the record companies with NAPSTER and retribution for PLEXOR to<br> You did'nt bring down the record companies<br> Name 1<br> In court<br> YEAH<br> You want to buy TOWER RECORD Eduardo<br> He told story after story about<br> life in SILICON VALLEY, parties at STANFORD<br> down in LA freinds who become Millionaires--<br> but mostly how Mark had to he had to come to California...<br> and then he cut around to FACEBOOK<br> So tell me about your progress<br> well were in 29 schools now<br> we got over 75000 members<br> tell me about the strategy your using<br> OK<br> For intance we wanted BAYLOR in Texas but BAYLOR already had a social network on campus so<br> instead of going right after them we made a list of every school within a hundred miles<br> Put the FACEBOOK on those capuses first<br> Pretty soon all the BAYLOR kids were seeing their freinds on our site and we were in<br> Its called the little bighorn, its smart Mark<br> Thanks that was mine<br> Hey you know what settle an arguement for us<br> I say its time to start making money through the FACEBOOK<br> but Mark does'nt want to advertise<br> whos right<br> well neither of you yet<br> The FACEBOOK is cool thats what its got going for it<br> you dont want to ruin it with adds, because adds are'nt cool<br> Exactly<br> Its like your throwing the greatest party on campus<br> and someone saying its gotta be over by 11<br> you dont even know what the thing is yet<br> How big it can get, How far it can go<br> This is no time to put your chips down<br> A million dollars isnt cool, you know whats cool<br> YOU<br> A Billion dollars<br> It shut everybody up<br> and thats were your headed<br> a billion dollar evaluation<br> unless you take bad advice in which case you might as well have come up with a cahin of very succesful Yogurt shops<br> when you go fishing you can catch alot of fish<br> or you can catch a big fish<br> You ever walk into a den and see a picture of him standing next to 14 trout<br> No hes holding a 3000 pound marlin<br> YEP<br> Thats a good analogy<br> OK we all know that Marlins dont really wegh 300 pounds right<br> Have you seen the big ones up close<br> No I have'nt<br> But looking at the guy holding a Marlin the size of a RangeRover<br> that would be a really big fish and a very strong guy<br> I think you might be getting away from the point<br> I dont have a dog in this fight, I just came to say HI<br> He owned Mark after that dinner<br> He picked up the check and he told Mark that they would talk together soon<br> and he was gone,but not before he made his biggest contribution to the company<br> Drop the "THE"just FACEBOOK<br> Thats gotta be some kind of landspeed record for talking<br> You want to end the party at 11<br> Im trying to pay for the party<br> there wont be a party<br> unless its cool<br> Yeah sure lets drop the"THE"<br> I meant catching the Marlin instead of 14 trout<br> does'nt that sound good<br> If your a trout<br> Im going to enter this into the record, incorporation papers for FACEBOOK and their also registered in Florida<br> why Florida<br> Well thats were my familiy lives<br> and ask the respondents to stipulate that the articles of incorporation state the ownership as follows<br> I'll stipulate<br> and that was April13th 2004<br> You can Mark it<br> Do you have anything here<br> Yes thank-you<br> Mr.Saverin have you ever done anything that might be considered as legitimate grounds for termination<br> NO<br> You've never did anything to embarass the company or even seriously jeapordise it<br> NO<br> NO<br> NO<br> You were accused of Animal cruelty<br> You were'nt<br> This is not happenning<br> Well

at the college<br> this was all resolved<br> Someone from the Fly or the Porc must have reported it, for all I know it was the WinkleVoss's<br> allright lets just forget about it<br> This is absurd<br> Im being accused of animal cruelty<br> next i'll be accused of necrophelia<br> It is better to be accused of necrophelia<br> Im gonna have to explain this to my father ,Im goonna have to explain this to everybody<br> what is happenning on that<br> I have my final coming up for "Post War and Contemporary Art" and I havent been to class<br> Im supposed to write about those 4

going,<br> Was Mr Zuckberg cheating on his final exam<br> I.d rather not answer that question<br> and why not<br> cause Im not suing him for cheating on his final exam<br> Thats not what freinds do<br> well you just told us he was cheating<br> OOPPS<br> You told your lawyer I was torturing animals<br> No he did'nt tell us about it at all our litigators are capable of finding a CRIMSON article<br> In fact when we raised the subject he defended you<br> SO<br> OH yeah that remind me....<br> were gonna need more money<br> I aggree more servers..apps<br> Im interviewing 2 interns to come to PAULO ALTO and we are going to have to pay them something<br> sorry what<br> I already found a house for rent on a street 2 blocks from the STANFORD campus<br> its perfect and its gotta

place we gotta be<br> What your Jed Clampett<br> What you got the Beverly Hill Billbillies in BRAZIL<br> What is your problem with Sean<br> He doesnt bring anything to the table<br> doesnt have money, Dustns a better programmer<br> Hes got connections<br> got connections to VC<br> If we need advertisers I have connections to VC<br> The real players and as someone whos just really embarrased the company in a bad way<br> It was the WnkleVoss's Mark<br> Hang-on<br> hit refresh<br> Eduardo<br> Congratulations<br> You dont think it was strange that he was followed by private detectives<br> Who came up with nothing<br> enough to get him out of the company the drugs the girls<br> We dont know if any of thats true<br> Read about it<br> and I can read about you torturing birds, since when does reading about something...<br> dont eat other fish, the Marlins and the Trout<br> Whats he talking about<br> Im intervieing interns at 10 tommorow night in the CS lab<br> Get onboard with this man you know<br> I dont really know what else to say<br> Whats going on<br> They have 10 minutes to get root access to a python webserver, expose its SSL encryption then intercept all traffic over its secure port<br> Their hacking<br> All behind a PIX Firewall Emulator, butn heres the beauty<br> You know I did'nt understand anything you just said right<br> I do know that<br> So whats the beauty<br> every 10th line of code written they have to take a shot,<br> and hacking supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to take a shot.<br> I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all 5 computers.<br> The last candidate to hit the window has to take a shot.<br> Plus every 3 minutes they all have to take a shot<br> can I ask what part of the interns job will they need to be able to do drunk<br> Your right a more relavant test would be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week<br> That was mean<br> HERE<br> WHAT IS THIS<br> I opened a new acount and put 1800 dollars in it<br> will that get you through the summer<br> Welcome to FACEBOOK<br> Yes<br> In addition to the 1000 dollars you

Zuckerburg taking the company and moving it to California<br> for the summer why did you put 18000 dollars in the account for his use<br> I figured we were partners<br> I wanted to be a team player<br> I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns<br> could work on the site while I was generating advertiser interest in New York<br> But mostly I figured<br> how much could possibly go wrong in 3 months<br> OK ready<br> sounds like an eight<br> That was like a 2<br> Hes better then that<br> Im OK<br> YOU SURE<br> Thats the doorbell<br> I did'nt know we had a doorbell<br> Andrew get the

stunt on CASE EQUITY<br> and Manningham was so impressed that he was now making an investment offer that was hard to pin down<br> so i went to California and I went straight to the new offices<br> i did'nt know weather to dress for the party or the business meeting<br> so i kinda dressed for both<br> but it did'nt matter<br> why not<br> because i was'nt called out there for either one<br> what
