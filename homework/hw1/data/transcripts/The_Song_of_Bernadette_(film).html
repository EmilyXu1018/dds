                        Soubirous.<br> Soubirous.<br> If you go early,<br> maybe you'll find work.<br> Mm.<br> Bonjour,<br> Monsieur Maisongrosse.<br> Ah, no work<br> for you today.<br> How can I hire anybody when<br> there isn't enough to keep me busy?<br> People don't<br> come to bakers anymore.<br> No, they go to pastry cooks<br> because it's stylish.<br> Why don't you<br> try the hospital?<br> The man who was doing odd jobs<br> moved to Tarbes yesterday.<br> Merci, monsieur.<br> Take that stuff clear out to the dump<br> at Massabielle and burn every bit of it.<br> It's full of infection<br> and disease.<br> Why did Christ<br> found the Church?<br> Christ founded the Church to teach,<br> govern, sanctify, and save all men.<br> How long did Christ<br> live on Earth?<br> Christ lived on Earth about 33 years<br> and led a most holy life in poverty.<br> That is correct, except that you omitted<br> the last and most important word.<br> "In poverty and suffering."<br> Never forget that, my child...<br> for only through suffering can we<br> hope to gain the Kingdom of God.<br> What is the Holy Trinity?<br> I said,<br> "What is the Holy Trinity?"<br> - Didn't you hear me?<br> - Yes, Sister, I heard you...<br> but I know nothing about it.<br> Have you ever heard of it?<br> Maybe I've heard of it.<br> You puzzle me, my child.<br> Are you pert, indifferent,<br> or only stupid?<br> I'm stupid, Sister.<br> I have a poor head for study.<br> You're also pert.<br> You're a grown girl, Bernadette...<br> the oldest in the class.<br> Ignorance of the Holy Trinity<br> is inexcusable.<br> Go to the foot of the class.<br> What is it, Marie?<br> I just wanted to say<br> that my sister Bernadette...<br> was sick the day the class learned<br> about the Holy Trinity.<br> She misses school a lot.<br> - She's always ailing.<br> - What ails her?<br> They call it "atma"<br> or some such name.<br> - You trying to say asthma?<br> - Yes, Sister. That's what Dr. Dozous calls it.<br> She can't breathe.<br> Sometimes she sounds just like this...<br> - Laughter wastes valuable time.<br> Return to your studies.<br> Antoinette, perhaps you can tell<br> Bernadette what the Holy Trinity is.<br> The Holy Trinity is one God<br> in three divine persons.<br> God the Father, God the Son<br> and God the Holy Ghost.<br> Sister Marie Threse, bonjour.<br> Bonjour,<br> Father Peyramale.<br> - Bonjour, children.<br> - Bonjour, Your Reverence.<br> I was passing,<br> so I thought I'd stop in, Sister...<br> to see how many children<br> you were preparing for First Communion.<br> Six. We were just having<br> a review of our catechism.<br> Well, you all know<br> your catechism?<br> Yes, Your Reverence.<br> To learn your catechism<br> requires great diligence.<br> I believe such diligence<br> should be rewarded.<br> I have some holy pictures.<br> Would you like one?<br> Oh, yes, Your Reverence.<br> Very well.<br> - Here you are.<br> - Thank you, Your Reverence.<br> - As you grow older...<br> - Thank you, Your Reverence.<br> You will realize that<br> in learning your catechism...<br> you have given yourselves not only<br> a foundation of religious teachings...<br> but also a doctrine to guide you<br> as human beings throughout your lives.<br> I'm sorry, Father.<br> This girl is not deserving.<br> It would be unfair to the others.<br> The have studied<br> their catechism. She has not.<br> Well, that's too bad.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It should be<br> an incentive to you then. Study hard.<br> You found work?<br> Twenty sous!<br> From the baker?<br> Where then?<br> Don't ask me.<br> - You didn't beg.<br> - Worse.<br> Stinking filth<br> from the hospital...<br> had to be carted away<br> and burned.<br> That's the kind of job<br> they give to Soubirous.<br> This is where<br> they let him live.<br> Soubirous, the miller...<br> who made the finest<br> flour in Escobe...<br> lives in a jail...<br> that's too cold and damp<br> for prisoners.<br> Wasn't good enough<br> for thieves and murderers...<br> but for Soubirous<br> and his family...<br> sure, let them live here.<br> Let them freeze in the winter<br> and roast in the summer.<br> Let them get sick and die.<br> Who cares?<br> Come in, Jeanne.<br> Maman, Jeanne came along.<br> She's going to help me<br> with my studies later.<br> All right. There's always enough<br> for one more. Sit down, all of you.<br> Oh, please don't, madame. I'm not a<br> bit hungry. I'll just watch the others.<br> Hail Father, Son and Holy Ghost.<br> The one that eats fastest gets the most.<br> Justin! Where did you learn that?<br> You'll go to hell<br> for saying such a thing.<br> All I said, "The one that eats the<br> fastest gets the most." And it's true!<br> - Now you've said it again!<br> - I've seen pigs with better manners and cleaner faces.<br> Get up from that table and go<br> wash yourselves! Both of you!<br> Oh, a mass meeting here, hmm?<br> How can anybody sleep with such racket?<br> - We're sorry, Papa.<br> - It's cold in here. Somebody fix a fire.<br> - There's no wood.<br> - So I'm to get the wood too?<br> I work hard all day long.<br> All I ask is a little peace and warmth.<br> What do I get?<br> Cold and chills.<br> Must I do everything<br> around here?<br> I'll go hunt for wood, Papa!<br> - May I go with Marie and help, maman?<br> - No. You'll do no such thing.<br> - You know how easily you catch cold.<br> - I'll dress real warm.<br> - Maman.! Maman.!<br> - Please?<br> - All right. All right. Only wrap up good!<br> - Maman.! Maman.!<br> - Can I go too? Oh, but please, maman.<br> - No!<br> You'll stay in this house and spend the<br> rest of the day asking God for forgiveness.<br> - Louise! Louise!<br> - What's wrong, Croisine?<br> The baby! Convulsions again! I don't<br> know what to do! Help me, Louise!<br> - Be calm, Croisine! Go back. I'll be over in a minute.<br> - Please, come now.<br> - Maman, can I go with you and look?<br> - No!<br> You stay here with your brother.<br> You can ask<br> for a little forgiveness too!<br> I want you girls back<br> before dark.<br> - Come on, Bernadette!<br> - Hurry up!<br> The last one<br> over the bridge is a goose!<br> Hola, Bernadette.<br> Good day,<br> Madame Nicolau.<br> - Are your parents well?<br> - Yes. Very well. Thank you.<br> - Are your parents well?<br> - Yes. Very well. Thank you.<br> And how is your son<br> Monsieur Antoine?<br> Splendid, thank you. And, uh,<br> Mademoiselle Bernadette?<br> I'm well.<br> Thank you, monsieur.<br> Well, I'd better hurry on.<br> My sister will wonder about me.<br> May I use your bridge?<br> As often as you like...<br> and no toll charge.<br> Thank you, monsieur.<br> Here. You better let me help you.<br> That bridge is not so dependable.<br> Thank you, monsieur.<br> You're very kind.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> She's growing into<br> a fine young woman, isn't she?<br> Marie!<br> Marie!<br> Jeanne!<br> - Oh! Oh, for a moment I thought<br> it was the devil himself.<br> - You should have seen your face!<br> - You were nothing but eyes and mouth.<br> - You'd have been scared too.<br> - There's the wood over there. Come on. Follow me.<br> - We'll wade across.<br> - That's private property over there.<br> - What if it is?<br> - If we take wood from there, we'll be stealing.<br> Wood is wood. Don't<br> be such a fraidy cat, Bernadette.<br> - I'm not a fraidy cat.<br> - Yes, you are too.<br> Come on, Marie.<br> Let's go.<br> Oh! It's cold!<br> It's freezing! Hurry up!<br> - It's cold.! Hurry.!<br> - It's co-o-old.!<br> Bernadette, don't you<br> come in that water!<br> Remember<br> what maman told you!<br> - I won't catch cold.<br> - Oh, won't you? You'll get a cough...<br> then your asthma<br> will keep me awake all night long.<br> Maybe I can jump<br> across the rocks or something.<br> Yes, and tumble in.<br> And when you fall in and get your bottom<br> wet, don't ask me to wring you out.<br> But if I dry my feet real well,<br> I won't catch cold.<br> Oh, we don't need you anyway.<br> Come on, Marie. Let's go.<br> You stay there<br> till we get back.<br> But three can carry<br> more than two can.!<br> But what if she's not there?<br> I can't carry this heavy bundle<br> all the way back into town.<br> Bernadette.!<br> Yoo-hoo.!<br> See? I told you<br> she'd sneak off.<br> No, no. She wouldn't do that.<br> She's here somewhere.<br> There she is. Bernadette!<br> Bernadette, come on.!<br> We've gotta go home.!<br> Bernadette, come on, now.!<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Bernadette!<br> Maybe she's dead.<br> Holy Mother!<br> Maybe her asthma's killed her.<br> Oh, nonsense.<br> If she were dead, she'd be lying flat.<br> - Whoever heard of a dead person kneeling?<br> - Then why doesn't she speak?<br> She's trying to be funny.<br> I'll show her.<br> Bernadette.!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - That's what we're asking you!<br> - I thought your asthma had killed you!<br> Don'tjust stand there. Come on.! You<br> know we've got to get home before dark.<br> I'm coming.<br> We're not gonna wade through<br> that cold water again.<br> You go down that side<br> of the river...<br> and we'll meet you<br> at the bridge.<br> What cheats you two are.<br> This water is as warm as dishwater.<br> - Bernadette!<br> - You've got bats in your belfry!<br> - That water's freezing!<br> - Well, it isn't now.<br> Look, my toes<br> are not even white.<br> What were you doing over there,<br> kneeling in the rocks?<br> - Didn't you see anyone?<br> - Who?<br> Was somebody with you<br> in that cave?<br> Ohh. Somebody was.<br> And you were praying<br> for forgiveness.<br> - Jeanne.<br> - Come on. Tell us who it was.<br> Well, if I tell you...<br> you must swear<br> not to give me away.<br> If maman should hear of it,<br> she might take a stick to me.<br> - I swear.<br> - I give you my word, but I won't swear.<br> Swearing like that<br> is a mortal sin...<br> and you don't want me to sin like that<br> just before my First Communion, do you?<br> Aw, come on.<br> Tell us.<br> Well...<br> I saw a lady...<br> and she was all in white.<br> - A lady?<br> - And she wore a blue girdle...<br> and had a golden rose<br> on each foot.<br> I've never seen anything<br> in my life so beautiful.<br> Oh, piffle.<br> What would a beautiful lady<br> be doing in a filthy place like that?<br> I don't know.<br> But she was there...<br> truly, she was.<br> Tsk.<br> Come on.<br> Let's get away from here.<br> You take that bundle.<br> No. I'll take this one.<br> It's bigger, and you must be tired.<br> The girls are not home yet?<br> Huh? No.<br> Oh, uh, Madame Millet's<br> coachman was here...<br> said there wouldn't<br> be anymore washing for you to do.<br> Tsk.<br> Where is the food<br> going to come from?<br> Don't ask me.<br> I've been laying here<br> worrying about that all afternoon.<br> Bernadette!<br> Where have you been?<br> - I've been worried to death.<br> - But we got wood, maman.<br> Three bundles...<br> enough for days.<br> There are other things to be done<br> besides getting wood.<br> Sweeping and cleaning<br> and water to be fetched.<br> - I'll fetch the water, Maman.<br> - I'm about at the end of my rope.<br> Bernadette!<br> Bernadette! Don't run!<br> - See you at school tomorrow. Maman, please take this.<br> - Good night, Marie.<br> Tsk. She has no business<br> running like that.<br> She ran all the way home.<br> I couldn't even catch up to her.<br> She'll be coughing all night.<br> Bernadette's all excited...<br> because she says<br> she saw a lady at Massabielle...<br> all dressed in white<br> with golden roses on her feet.<br> - What on earth are you talking about?<br> - That's what she told us.<br> Golden roses on her feet.<br> She said this lady was standing<br> on a rock and smiled at her.<br> She had a rosary of pearls<br> and a golden crucifix...<br> Marie.!<br> You told on me.<br> And you said you wouldn't.<br> Maman asked me.<br> What's this foolishness<br> Marie tells me?<br> It's true, maman. In the cave at<br> Massabielle, I saw a most beautiful lady.<br> A lady? What lady?<br> I don't know.<br> Suddenly she was there...<br> and then, suddenly,<br> she disappeared.<br> - Ahh. Nonsense.<br> - Oh, no, maman. She was there.<br> Her face was so beautiful.<br> Just to look at her made me feel...<br> Soubirous,<br> you hear what she says?<br> I heard... and I know<br> why she says it too.<br> She's showing off.<br> Makes up a story to feel important.<br> It always starts<br> the same way with fairy tales.<br> Golden roses on her feet!<br> Indeed.!<br> No, Papa.<br> I really and truly saw the Lady.<br> Truly, I did.<br> Come in!<br> It's for you, dear friend.<br> For saving my baby today.<br> Compared to a child's life, it's not<br> much, but we want you to have it.<br> Oh, no.<br> No, I can't possibly.<br> It's the only way<br> we have of repaying you.<br> Please.<br> Yes, Louise.<br> After all, if our friends<br> are good enough to offer...<br> then the least we can do<br> is accept.<br> - But you need the food as much as we do.<br> - No, no.<br> My aunt came today<br> with much more than this.<br> We are merely sharing<br> our good fortune with you.<br> May God bless you both.<br> - Why, this is food enough for days.<br> - Sausages.!<br> Just like the kind<br> in the butcher's window!<br> - What a magnificent omelette those eggs will make.<br> - Ah, Louis!<br> Bonsoir, Charles.<br> Madame, monsieur.<br> Ah, Louis.<br> Good to see you.<br> What brings you here<br> besides a cold rump?<br> - You heard about Doutreloux?<br> - The stableman for Cazenave?<br> Uh-huh. A horse kicked him<br> and broke his leg.<br> - The horse broke his leg?<br> - No, no.<br> Doutreloux broke his leg...<br> three places.<br> - Oh, mercy. That is bad.<br> - Oh, mercy, that is good.<br> - Oh, shame on you!<br> - I mean it is bad for Doutreloux...<br> but it's good for your husband.<br> Cazenave offers you the job.<br> That's why I'm here.<br> It pays two francs a day<br> and your lunch.<br> - Soubirous!<br> - Two francs a day!<br> - And the lunches are hot.<br> - Papa, can I ride in the coach with you?<br> Me first. I'm older.<br> Why, you seem surprised.<br> After all, it was agreed<br> between Cazenave and myself...<br> that I should<br> fill the first vacancy.<br> But stableman? Well, I suppose even<br> a miller can't be too choosy these days.<br> You may tell Cazenave<br> that I accept.<br> He knows it. He wants you be there<br> at 5:00 in the morning.<br> - Tears, maman?<br> - Only because I am so happy.<br> I'm happy too.<br> We must celebrate.<br> - You will all stay to dinner.<br> - Oh, no, no, no.<br> - Nonsense. You will dine with us!<br> - But tonight? I hadn't planned.<br> So we change our plan.<br> We have food. I have a position.<br> - We accepted your eggs. Now you<br> must accept our omelette.<br> I will not hear another word!<br> Children, help your mother.!<br> A succulent omelette<br> with sausages, maman.<br> Maman.! Maman.! Maman.!<br> Well, what is it?<br> - Bernadette.<br> - Speak. Speak!<br> - She's dead or something.<br> - What?<br> She's all white<br> and sick-looking.<br> Where is she?<br> They're taking her<br> to Madame Nicolau's.<br> Oh, please. Please stay outside.<br> Outside, all of you.<br> - Please leave her in peace. She's very sick.<br> - It's all right, maman.<br> She's opening her eyes.<br> - Do you feel better now?<br> - Yes. Thank you, madame.<br> - I'll fix you some warm milk.<br> - Thank you very much, but I don't need anything.<br> What was the matter?<br> What happened?<br> The Lady was there<br> a long time...<br> and she spoke to me.<br> She spoke to you?<br> What did she say?<br> She said...<br> "Will you render me the grace<br> of coming here each day for 15 days?"<br> And then she added...<br> "I cannot promise to make you<br> happy in this world...<br> only in the next."<br> So after church we asked<br> Bernadette to come with us...<br> because we wanted to see<br> if we could see the Lady.<br> - Well, did you see her?<br> - No. None of us saw her.<br> But Bernadette said she did.<br> Please.<br> Bernadette.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yes, maman.<br> There's nothing<br> to worry about.<br> Nothing to worry about?<br> Scare me half to death, and you say<br> there's nothing to worry about.<br> I left your father's dinner<br> to burn.<br> I ran through the streets like<br> a madwoman. And what do I find?<br> You sitting there like a...<br> like a princess on a throne.<br> - You good for n...<br> - Don't strike the child!<br> She's an Angel of God.<br> Angel?<br> She's the laughingstock<br> of Lourdes.<br> Come, maman. Maybe we can<br> get home before Papa does.<br> No. I won't budge from this place until you<br> promise me never again to go to Massabielle.<br> - Never!<br> - But, maman, I can't promise that.<br> The Lady has asked me<br> to return every day for 15 days.<br> Promise your mother, Bernadette.<br> Such excitement's bad for you.<br> You're sure to be<br> sick from it.<br> Very well.<br> I promise you, maman,<br> never to go to Massabielle again...<br> unless you, yourself,<br> give me permission.<br> And that, I can promise you,<br> you'll never get!<br> I'm going to send you<br> to your Aunt Bernarde in Bartres...<br> where you'll forget<br> this foolishness.<br> Now, home with you.<br> And you too!<br> Thank you for your kindness,<br> Madame Nicolau.<br> And thank you too, monsieur.<br> What do you<br> think of it all, maman?<br> Things like that<br> bode no good.<br> Maman, as long as I live, I'll<br> never see anything more beautiful...<br> than the face of that girl<br> as she lay there at Massabielle.<br> One ought not even<br> touch a being like that.<br> Maman. Maman.<br> - Hmm? What is it?<br> - Bernadette's crying.<br> What's the matter,<br> my love?<br> Come to Mother.<br> We'll sit by the fire.<br> Oh, maman, the Lady<br> was so beautiful.<br> - Just to think of her makes me feel...<br> - There, there, there.<br> Girls of your age<br> often see things that don't exist.<br> But it passes.<br> You must just<br> put it out of your mind.<br> You're a big girl now.<br> Soon you'll be a woman.<br> You'll marry a man<br> and you'll have children...<br> just as I did.<br> Life goes fast...<br> my child.<br> It's hard to believe<br> how fast.<br> If she stays here,<br> I fear for her health.<br> She speaks to no one. She doesn't sleep.<br> She doesn't eat enough to keep a bird alive.<br> Bernarde, couldn't you take her<br> to live with you?<br> To walk down the the street and have everybody<br> point you out as the father of that idiot...<br> - I'm a respectable miller!<br> - You are also the girl's father.<br> And you seem to overlook the fact<br> that you are her mother.<br> The two people in the world who should<br> be comforting and understanding...<br> and you want to ship her off<br> as if she were a sack of flour.<br> - I'm thinking only...<br> - Only of yourself.<br> Bernadette is a simple,<br> honest child.<br> She hasn't the cunning<br> to invent anything like this.<br> She sees this lady.<br> Nobody else does.<br> Who are you to say<br> that she is wrong and you are right?<br> This lady may well be<br> a heavenly creature.<br> Ahh. Heavenly creatures don't appear<br> in a filthy place like a city dump.<br> Christ was born in a stable.<br> This is a wild story<br> Bernadette tells.<br> But since the Lady has asked her to go<br> to the grotto for 15 days, she must go.<br> - Oh, I won't allow her to go again.<br> - You will go with her.<br> You can't hide your head<br> in the sand...<br> and act as if your daughter were up to some<br> harmless mischief that doesn't concern you.<br> This is no joke. Consider<br> what this means to Bernadette.<br> - But what will people say?<br> - Nothing...<br> if you take your place<br> by her side.<br> All the women of the family<br> must stand by her.<br> I'll come.<br> And when I walk with her,<br> let anyone dare to laugh.<br> The matter has been<br> put before the council and approved.<br> So, therefore, fully convinced<br> that your request is justified...<br> I am forwarding your plan,<br> as well as my recommendation...<br> - to the... to the Minister of the Interior.<br> - Commissioner.<br> Signed Baron Massy,<br> Prefect.<br> So you see, gentlemen, the ceaseless<br> protestations of your mayor have borne fruit.<br> The highest authorities are contemplating<br> bringing the railroad to Lourdes.<br> - Splendid.<br> - Magnificent.<br> - Commissioner. That Soubirous girl went to Massabielle again.<br> - What is it?<br> - What should I do?<br> - I thought her mother had forbidden it?<br> Well, today<br> her mother went with her.<br> To think that such a thing could happen<br> in the middle of the 19th century.<br> - Oh, the girl's insane.<br> - Or suffering from hallucinations.<br> Your Honor, may I suggest<br> that you act without delay.<br> But, monsieur, for the mayor ever to<br> acknowledge the existence of such a situation...<br> would serve only<br> to give it importance...<br> an importance which the newspapers<br> would not ignore.<br> It's clearly a matter<br> for the imperial prosecutor.<br> No. Unfortunately,<br> the state has no charges to prefer.<br> It's up to<br> the commissioner of police.<br> No one has broken any law.<br> It's the duty of the district officer.<br> Massabielle's<br> in your district, isn't it?<br> - Yes, Commissioner.<br> - Then take care of it.<br> L...<br> I ran ahead to tell you<br> I'm not alone today.<br> I hope you won't mind.<br> Maman, Aunt Bernarde<br> and my sister are with me.<br> And some other people<br> followed us.<br> I'm sorry, but maman wouldn't<br> let me come by myself.<br> I desire that people<br> should come here.<br> Where is she?<br> - Is she here?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> She's standing there<br> in the niche.<br> She's greeting you now.<br> See?<br> Clear out down there!<br> All of you return to your homes<br> immediately!<br> Did you hear me?<br> I said, "Clear out.!"<br> This is hopeless.<br> It's more than<br> one policeman can handle.<br> It's a scandal.<br> It cries to heaven.<br> Imagine these penny-a-liners having<br> the audacity to print such a thing.<br> All France<br> will be laughing at us.<br> And Lourdes was going to<br> have a railroad connection.<br> I'd even gone so far as to have<br> the plans drawn up for the depot.<br> Do you think they'll<br> be granted to us now?<br> Never. Who's going to<br> run a railroad...<br> into a hole where spooks perform<br> their medieval antics in dirty cabins?<br> We are dealing with<br> a whole lot more...<br> than the mere babbling<br> of a little swindler or an imbecile.<br> The entire future<br> of this town is at stake!<br> Something must be done<br> to stop this nonsense immediately.<br> - How?<br> - How?<br> Well, that's up to you<br> and the prosecutor.<br> As much as I'd like to put an end<br> to this stupidity, I am helpless.<br> The child goes peacefully<br> to the outskirts of the city.<br> There she kneels,<br> says her rosary and goes home again.<br> Now, tell me,<br> is there anything unlawful in that?<br> Yes, on the ground<br> that it's, uh...<br> insulting to<br> religious sensibilities.<br> Really?<br> You can hardly call seeing the Blessed<br> Virgin in a veritable cesspool...<br> complimentary<br> to the Holy Family.<br> But that's just the point. She hasn't<br> claimed to see the Blessed Virgin.<br> - The crowd claims that.<br> - She says she sees a lady...<br> a beautiful lady.<br> And the visioning<br> of a beautiful lady...<br> can hardly be construed<br> as a violation of the criminal code.<br> It better not be, or else<br> the entire male population of France...<br> will be spending most<br> of its time behind bars.<br> This is hardly the moment for levity.<br> Yes, yes, yes.<br> What is it? What is it?<br> Pardon me, sir,<br> but Dr. Dozous is here to see you.<br> - Ask the doctor to wait.<br> - Just a moment.<br> Dr. Dozous might be<br> very helpful to us.<br> Let's not overlook the vast possibilities<br> offered by a diagnosis of insanity.<br> Yes.<br> - Ask the doctor to come in.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Will you please come in, Doctor?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Doctor.<br> - Bonjour, monsieur.<br> - Bonjour.<br> - Ah, Doctor.<br> I'm, uh... I'm sorry<br> to interrupt, gentlemen...<br> but I've made several visits to<br> Massabielle for the purpose of observation.<br> Today I examined the girl. I thought you<br> gentlemen might be interested in my report.<br> - Yes. Yes, of course. Won't you sit down, Doctor?<br> - Splendid. What did you find?<br> Well, I arrived at the grotto<br> simultaneously with the crowd.<br> Immediately, the Soubirous girl knelt in<br> front of a niche in the side of the cliff...<br> made a series of courteous,<br> graceful, reverential gestures.<br> - Did you see anything in this niche?<br> - No.<br> - Did anybody else?<br> - N-No.<br> Well, then didn't<br> the crowd laugh at her?<br> No.<br> There was something about her<br> that precluded laughter.<br> Her exaltation...<br> was so genuine...<br> that the observer<br> almost had the impression...<br> that he saw<br> what the child saw.<br> Then as we continued<br> to gaze at her...<br> her face turned as pale<br> as white marble...<br> and her skin grew so taut...<br> that the structure of the skull<br> appeared clearly marked at the temples.<br> Considering the possibility...<br> that this was due<br> to cerebral anemia, I took her pulse.<br> It was practically average. Also, there<br> was no affection of the nervous system...<br> as in catalepsy or hysteria.<br> Even her eye reflexes<br> were normal.<br> Did she speak<br> to this thing in the niche?<br> Standing close beside her...<br> I heard twice in succession...<br> a long, drawn-out...<br> "Yes.<br> Yes, "<br> wrung from her very depths.<br> Evidently, she'd been<br> asked to convey a message...<br> because shortly after<br> she turned to the crowd and said...<br> "Pray for all sinners."<br> Anyone who talks to something<br> that isn't there is feebleminded.<br> Another medical possibility<br> which I took into consideration.<br> Wanting to test her mental abilities,<br> I put this question to her:<br> "Do you know<br> what a sinner is?"<br> Without hesitation,<br> she answered, "Certainly, monsieur.<br> A sinner<br> is one who loves evil."<br> That's quite a good answer.<br> What pleased me was that<br> she said "loves" and not "does."<br> Well, after this, any diagnosis of<br> feeblemindedness was out of the question.<br> Then she's a swindler.<br> There's not the slightest justification<br> for such an assumption.<br> Then I must presume, Doctor, that you<br> havejoined the ranks of the believers...<br> in this, uh, vision.<br> I am a doctor.<br> I contribute<br> to the Medical Courrier.<br> I'm a member of... several scientific<br> societies. I trust that is answer enough.<br> If I have correctly understood<br> your report, Doctor, it is this:<br> Science excludes fraud.<br> It excludes mental disease<br> and a miraculous occurrence.<br> I venture then<br> to ask science, what is left?<br> Yes. What is left?<br> If the Church stops it,<br> the people cannot blame us.<br> Precisely. We can sit back<br> and sympathize with both sides.<br> A very wise attitude<br> for any government.<br> - Is the dean at home?<br> - Yes, monsieur.<br> - Ah. Good morning, gentlemen.<br> - Ah. Good morning, Father.<br> Good morning. Come in.<br> - Take off your coats.<br> - Thank you.<br> I presume the Soubirous girl<br> is what brings you here.<br> - Yes.<br> - I want you to know...<br> that the Church attributes<br> no religious significance whatsoever...<br> to the so-called<br> visions of Massabielle.<br> - Sit down.<br> - I'm very glad to hear that, Father.<br> - Then you will talk to this girl and you...<br> - No.<br> It does not concern me.<br> That is a matter<br> for you city officials.<br> We had hoped<br> you would cooperate with us.<br> That I am doing.<br> Sit down.<br> I have instructed the cantonal clergy<br> not to set foot in the grotto...<br> and to ignore<br> the whole matter.<br> But Your Reverence<br> has enormous power over the people here.<br> Wouldn't it be appropriate<br> for you to raise your voice?<br> I have no intention of adding<br> further importance to this turmoil.<br> Then you force the state<br> to invoke the law...<br> which prohibits the Church<br> from opening any new place of worship...<br> without the formal consent<br> of the minister of worship.<br> The Church has not opened<br> any new place of worship.<br> The Church neither sponsors<br> nor recognizes...<br> these daily heathen gymnastics<br> which take place at Massabielle.<br> But how can you stand by...<br> and see your parishioners<br> carry on these...<br> these pagan ceremonies?<br> I understand that they use<br> a kitchen table as an altar.<br> And there they pray.<br> Yes, on a spot littered with filth,<br> they pray to God.<br> Prayer, gentlemen,<br> is good no matter where it is offered.<br> Yes, yes.<br> Well, shall we be going?<br> - Thank you, Father.<br> - Sure.<br> - Have a pleasant good morning, gentlemen.<br> - Good morning, Father.<br> Good morning.<br> That sly old fox.<br> By agreeing with us...<br> he's dumped the entire problem<br> right back in our laps.<br> Unfortunately,<br> the followers of the girl...<br> are citizens<br> of this community.<br> The thought of offending them<br> is not very pleasant.<br> - Especially with the election coming up.<br> - Well, then why offend them?<br> Why not refer the matter<br> to higher authorities?<br> A very good suggestion,<br> monsieur.<br> I'll write to the prefect<br> immediately.<br> "I consider it purely<br> a local problem...<br> "to be solved<br> by local authorities...<br> "and I do not wish to be<br> involved in any way whatsoever.<br> "Settle it without delay.<br> "The method I leave entirely<br> in the capable hands...<br> of you and your associates."<br> Signed, Baron Massy, Prefect.<br> There he sits, like a general...<br> safely out of the range<br> of fire...<br> and orders a handful of men<br> without any weapons...<br> to wipe out<br> an impregnable fortress.<br> "Our capable hands."<br> They're only capable<br> when there's a ticklish job to be done.<br> To think that one stupid girl<br> could cause all this trouble!<br> Only because there are millions<br> of others just as stupid as she is.<br> What can you expect from a peasantry<br> fed on religious dogmas...<br> and nurtured on<br> superstitious nonsense?<br> I firmly believe that this girl and what<br> she stands for is a menace to civilization.<br> The girl is dangerous,<br> I admit, but...<br> She's a religious fanatic...<br> and every time<br> religious fanaticism steps forward...<br> mankind moves backward.<br> And that is why<br> I will fight this vigorously...<br> and I'll resort to any measures<br> to defeat it.<br> I don't know much<br> about higher politics...<br> but I do know a lot about burglars<br> and thieves and scamps of all kinds.<br> I know how to scare them<br> and apply pressure.<br> I promise you that if you give me<br> five minutes with this girl...<br> she'll never<br> go near the grotto again.<br> Try it, by all means!<br> Try anything!<br> I was thinking of somewhat<br> the same procedure.<br> However, not quite so crude.<br> There's something<br> about the title "Imperial Prosecutor"...<br> that makes people quake.<br> Without so much<br> as raising my voice...<br> - I am confiden...<br> - You can't handle people like this...<br> with silk gloves<br> and fancy words.<br> We shall see. Send for<br> two of your policemen.<br> - Just the one.<br> - Bernadette.<br> You stay here, Marie,<br> and wait for maman to come home.<br> Don't worry her. Just tell her I've gone<br> to city hall with these gentlemen.<br> What are you<br> arresting her for?<br> - Don't interfere with the law.<br> - The law?<br> - That to the law! That for you too!<br> - Bah!<br> - Madame Davan! Madame Davan!<br> - Madame Davan!<br> They're arresting Bernadette!<br> Madame Probert! Madame Probert!<br> Look what those pigs are doing!<br> - Do you know who I am?<br> - Oh, yes, monsieur.<br> You're the imperial prosecutor.<br> And that title means that I have been<br> appointed by His Majesty the emperor.<br> He has vested in me<br> the power to punish...<br> anyone who perpetrates a fraud<br> against this community.<br> Now do you understand<br> my position?<br> Oh, yes. You're much the same<br> as MonsieurJacomet.<br> A good deal more.<br> I am his superior officer.<br> He hunts down the criminals<br> and swindlers. I send them to prison.<br> - Oh.<br> - Now, bearing in mind my title...<br> and realizing the extent<br> of my authority...<br> I ask you never again<br> to go to Massabielle.<br> Oh, but I must, monsieur.<br> The Lady has asked me.<br> Now there you go again<br> with this "lady."<br> Bernadette, you'll admit<br> you are very ignorant...<br> the worst pupil<br> in the whole school?<br> That is true, monsieur.<br> I'm very stupid.<br> Then you should take heed<br> when intelligent people assure you...<br> that this lady is only a childish<br> bit of imagination, an absurd dream.<br> The first time I saw the Lady,<br> I thought it was a dream too.<br> There now.<br> Now that wasn't so stupid.<br> Once you can mistake a dream<br> for something real...<br> but not six times.<br> Isn't it strange that until your first visit<br> to Massabielle, your family was destitute?<br> Now your mother is employed by a wealthy<br> family, and your father has a steady job.<br> And your followers have showered your<br> household with clothing and foodstuffs.!<br> If the court were to decide that your lady<br> represents a profitable business scheme...<br> it would go very hard<br> with you.<br> I have not accepted one thing, monsieur,<br> because I knew the Lady would not like it.<br> Look, my child,<br> I am trying to help you.<br> He's using the wrong technique.<br> He'll get nowhere.<br> I am not asking you<br> to retract anything.<br> I merely want you to promise me<br> that you will accept my counsel.<br> - If I can, monsieur, I will.<br> - Good. Now.<br> Put your hand in mine...<br> and promise me that you<br> will not go to the grotto again.<br> That I cannot promise, monsieur.<br> Let me remind you that I am<br> the imperial prosecutor.<br> I know, monsieur.<br> You told me that before.<br> Now listen, carefully, Bernadette.<br> In the next room is Jacomet.<br> He is cruel and mean.<br> Furthermore, he believes that everyone<br> should be treated like a criminal.<br> If you refuse me, I will be forced<br> to turn you over to him.<br> I can promise you<br> it will be horrible.<br> He will have you cringing<br> and crying in no time.<br> But I can spare you all this<br> if you will only be reasonable.<br> Well, what is your answer?<br> It is the same, monsieur.<br> I must keep my promise<br> to the Lady.<br> Very well!<br> I'm finished with you.<br> If you're intent upon<br> your own destruction, go.<br> Yes, monsieur.<br> What's your name?<br> But you know my name, monsieur.<br> - What's your name!<br> - Soubirous, Bernadette.<br> Before I go further...<br> I want you to know<br> I will write down everything you say.<br> Such a paper is known<br> as a deposition.<br> It will be sent to the<br> imperial prefect at Tarbes.<br> Besides, we also have<br> Monsieur Estrade for a witness.<br> You be very careful<br> what you say.<br> Now, about this lady<br> you claim to see.<br> Do you know who she is?<br> No, monsieur, I don't.<br> What does she wear?<br> A white veil<br> with a blue girdle.<br> And there's a rose<br> on each foot.<br> Hmm.<br> She stands quite still<br> like a statue in church?<br> Oh, no!<br> She's ever so natural.<br> She moves about<br> and talks to me.<br> She greets the people,<br> and even laughs.<br> Hmm. Do your parents believe<br> this story of yours?<br> No, monsieur.<br> I don't think they do.<br> And yet you expect me to believe<br> when your own parents don't?<br> If your lady were real,<br> wouldn't other people see her too?<br> I don't see why they can't.<br> She's there.<br> Now pay attention.<br> I'm going to<br> read your answers back to you...<br> so you can confirm<br> their correctness.<br> "Bernadette Soubirous declares the Lady<br> wears a blue veil and white girdle."<br> No, a white veil<br> and a blue girdle.<br> You're contradicting yourself!<br> You said a white girdle!<br> You must've made a mistake<br> in writing it down, monsieur.<br> "Bernadette Soubirous declares<br> the Lady resembles...<br> the statue of the Blessed Virgin<br> in the parish church."<br> No, that's not true.<br> The Lady has nothing to do<br> with the Blessed Virgin in the Church.<br> That's enough. Nothing but<br> a complete confession can save you now.<br> Tell me the names of all persons<br> who are in league with you.<br> And don't try to lie,<br> because I know every one of them.<br> I don't understand<br> what you're saying, monsieur.<br> I'll tell you.<br> Certain persons have put you up<br> to circulating this disgusting story.<br> They've trained you, stupid as you are, to reel<br> off by rote exactly what they taught you.<br> Now tell me...<br> Who are these people?<br> But you said a moment ago,<br> monsieur, you knew them.<br> The police are outside,<br> waiting my orders to take you to jail.<br> But if you promise before this witness that<br> you will never set foot in Massabielle again...<br> No. I must keep my promise<br> to the Lady.<br> You want me to call<br> the police?<br> If the police take me,<br> I can't help it.<br> And that's not all. I'll have your<br> mother and father thrown into jail too.<br> The rest of your family will starve.<br> Come in!<br> What the devil do you want?<br> My child.<br> That's all I want. My child.<br> Listen, Soubirous, this business at the grotto<br> has got to stop. I won't stand it any longer.<br> So help me God, Commissioner, that's all<br> I want too. It's destroying my family.<br> The girl's a minor.<br> You're responsible for her.<br> Forbid her to go out except to school.<br> Lock her up at home if you have to...<br> because if you don't,<br> I'll lock up the whole bunch of you.<br> Now, get out!<br> God help you if I have<br> to summon you again.<br> Well, monsieur,<br> what do you think of it?<br> I think you were<br> extremely fortunate...<br> in having the father break in<br> just when he did.<br> The fact that the authorities have<br> prevented her going from Massabielle...<br> has served to make her seem more<br> important in the eyes of her schoolmates.<br> - That is most unfortunate.<br> - The children gather and whisper about nothing else.<br> I'd hoped, with your permission,<br> to talk to them and...<br> No. The Bishop ofTarbes has forbidden<br> us even to recognize the situation.<br> And he's right in doing so.<br> Do you remember that girl<br> in Avignon? Rose Tamessiet?<br> She claimed to have seen<br> the Most Blessed Virgin also.<br> The Vicar General of that diocese<br> was patient and understanding.<br> Consequently, the people<br> mistook his attitude for approbation.<br> Then later, when the child<br> was exposed as a fraud...<br> the Church was looked upon<br> as her partner in crime.<br> Immediately, atheism flared up,<br> and the anticlerical forces triumphed.<br> That is not going<br> to happen here.<br> What I had in mind, Father,<br> could hardly be construed as approbation.<br> I had planned to make an example<br> of this child in front of the class.<br> - Ridicule?<br> - Yes, Father.<br> You have my permission<br> to try it. Good day, Sister.<br> Good day, Father.<br> Thank you.<br> She can't go on like this.<br> Night after night.<br> My poor little one.<br> What have they done to you?<br> Speak to me.<br> If I can't go see her anymore,<br> I shall die.<br> You shall see her.<br> I don't care<br> what Sister Vauzous says.<br> You'll go again to Massabielle,<br> and no one will prevent you.<br> If they lock me up,<br> well, let 'em.<br> But you shall see her.<br> I hope Baron Massy<br> subscribes to this paper.<br> Sounds a little different<br> from the last editorial, doesn't it?<br> Listen to this.<br> "The officials at Lourdes...<br> are to be highly commended for stamping<br> out these disgusting spectacles."<br> - But I have a feeling they will return to criticism again tomorrow.<br> - What makes you think that?<br> Because I am a man of greater vision<br> than you, Monsieur Le Mayor.<br> Especially when I sit<br> in this particular chair.<br> I told them,<br> if they did this again...<br> I'd put every one of them<br> in jail.<br> Careful, Commissioner. If you do that,<br> I'll have to release them in ten minutes.<br> - Then we would look foolish, wouldn't we?<br> - There must be some law to stop them.<br> - Commissioner...<br> - I know. They're going to Massabielle.<br> You don't have to tell me.<br> I've got eyes. I can see.<br> - No, they're not going to Massabielle.<br> - They're not?<br> They've already been.<br> They were there at 5:00 this morning.<br> They're on their way now<br> to the dean.<br> The dean?<br> Yes. The girl said the Lady<br> gave her a message for him.<br> Well, it seems the gods<br> have finally sided with us.<br> Gentlemen, maybe now the Church will be forced<br> to take a stand whether it wants to or not.<br> - Excuse me, Your Reverence.<br> - What do you want? Who are you?<br> - Bernadette Soubirous.<br> - Oh.<br> So you're the urchin<br> every idiot in France is talking about.<br> Do your courtiers and<br> servants always follow you?<br> If any of that crowd dare to enter<br> my garden, I'll have them arrested.<br> Well, speak.<br> What do you want of me?<br> - The Lady told me...<br> - What lady?<br> The Lady in Massabielle.<br> - Don't know her.<br> - She's a beautiful lady who always comes to me.<br> - Is she from Lourdes?<br> - No, Your Reverence.<br> - Have you asked her name?<br> - Yes, but she gives no answer.<br> - Perhaps the lady is deaf and dumb.<br> - Oh, no, she speaks to me.<br> What does she say?<br> Just now the Lady said,<br> "Please go to the priests...<br> and tell them a chapel<br> is to be built here."<br> Priests?<br> What does that mean?<br> It appears your lady<br> is a confirmed heathen.<br> The very cannibals have priests. We Catholics<br> have religious, each bearing a specific title.<br> But the Lady did say priests.<br> Well, you've come<br> to the wrong place anyhow.<br> - Have you any money with which to build a chapel?<br> - No, I have no money at all.<br> Then you go back and tell your lady if she<br> wants a chapel, she'll have to provide the money.<br> - Yes, Your Reverence.<br> - And you can also tell her, the Dean of Lourdes...<br> doesn't consider it very fitting<br> for a lady to climb barefoot on rocks...<br> and to send gibbering<br> adolescents with messages.<br> And what's more, once and for all,<br> he demands she leave him in peace.<br> - Do you understand?<br> - Yes, Your Reverence. I'll tell her...<br> Just one moment.<br> - Do you see this broom?<br> - Yes, Your Reverence.<br> Then listen carefully.<br> If you dare to annoy me<br> ever again...<br> I'll take this broom,<br> and with my own hands, I'll...<br> Come in.<br> I forgot something,<br> Your Reverence.<br> The Lady also said,<br> "Let processions come hither."<br> Processions, eh?<br> And do you think tomorrow<br> would be soon enough for your lady?<br> Oh, yes, I'm sure<br> she would be delighted!<br> - Now that I've given you the messages, I'll...<br> - One moment.<br> I'll decide<br> when you're to go.<br> Close the door.<br> I want you to convey a message<br> to your lady for me.<br> Yes, Your Reverence.<br> You find her quite<br> extraordinary, don't you?<br> Oh, yes, Your Reverence!<br> Good.<br> We shall find<br> how extraordinary she is.<br> I have heard that there is a wild rosebush<br> growing in the grotto. Is that true?<br> Oh, yes. Right under the niche<br> where the Lady always stands.<br> Splendid. I want you<br> to tell the lady this.<br> The Dean of Lourdes would like her<br> to perform a little miracle.<br> He would like her to make<br> the wild rosebush bloom...<br> now, this last week<br> in February.<br> - Do you understand?<br> - Yes, Your Reverence.<br> Then repeat what I said.<br> The Dean of Lourdes would like the Lady<br> to perform a little miracle.<br> To make<br> the wild rosebush bloom...<br> now, this last week<br> in February.<br> Is that correct?<br> Yes.<br> I'll tell the Lady.<br> Good day, Your Reverence.<br> Squad, halt!<br> Well, gentlemen,<br> I'm off to see the miracle.<br> Bring me back a dozen roses,<br> will you please?<br> I rather think I'll bring you back<br> The dean set no definite time.<br> Why do you assume<br> that today's the day?<br> We don't.<br> Her followers did that.<br> - It should be on Thursday, they said.<br> - Why Thursday?<br> Because someone who had nothing<br> better to do figured out...<br> that she first saw the Lady on a Thursday,<br> the Lady returned to her on a Thursday...<br> so naturally the buds<br> shall burst on a Thursday.<br> Buds or no buds, you will never<br> destroy that girl's faith.<br> Can you say the same<br> of the crowd?<br> - Wouldn't we be surprised<br> if the bush did bloom today!<br> Don't underestimate<br> the Dean of Lourdes.<br> Who is the best authority<br> on roses in this district?<br> Peyramale.<br> The weather too for that matter.<br> You mean you think the dean...<br> I merely think it is singularly strange<br> that Peyramale, of all people...<br> picks a rose bush, of all things,<br> to demonstrate a miracle.<br> Why didn't he ask the Lady<br> to make the rock into a white horse...<br> or change the river water<br> into wine?<br> Anything yet?<br> - No.<br> - Then nothing will happen.<br> - Shh!<br> - Quiet. Keep still.<br> It's no use, I tell you.<br> The bush will not bloom.<br> Shh, will you keep quiet?<br> - All right.<br> But you will see.<br> Life is not like that.<br> I don't see something.<br> Do you?<br> #Santa Maria #<br> #Mater dei #<br> Go to the spring, drink<br> of the water and wash there.<br> No, not the river.<br> Not the river?<br> The spring yonder.<br> - Eat of the plants.<br> - Eat of the plants.<br> - What's she doing now?<br> - Shh.<br> Drink of the spring,<br> and wash there.<br> The spring? Drink of the water,<br> and wash myself?<br> What is she looking for?<br> She uses her nose<br> like a pig.<br> Yes! And she roots up<br> the ground.<br> - Come, darling.<br> - No, I must wash myself in the spring.<br> There's no spring here,<br> Bernadette.<br> There is! There is!<br> The Lady said so.<br> - Citizens!<br> - Shh.<br> At last you've seen with<br> your own eyes what we officials<br> have known all along.<br> That this story of the Blessed Virgin<br> was born in a sick and warped mind.<br> You've been duped by an idiot.<br> I beg of you. Go back to your homes<br> and never return here again.<br> Fall in.!<br> Don't be sad, Antoine.<br> I told you not to hope too much.<br> I knew it would not bloom.<br> You must learn<br> to expect nothing from God.<br> And when you get nothing,<br> you will not be disappointed.<br> Keep still.<br> Go away and let me alone.<br> From the time we are knee-high,<br> they tell us the Blessed Virgin<br> is loving and good.<br> Was she good to that girl<br> just now?<br> Was she good to me? Me, Bouriette,<br> the finest stone-carver in Lourdes!<br> I'll never forget that day.<br> I was carving a statue<br> for the Church.<br> A chip of marble flew off my chisel<br> and hit me in the eye.<br> And as quick as that,<br> I was no longer a stonecutter.<br> And that's how<br> the Blessed Virgin repaid me...<br> by throwing a stone in my eye.<br> Ever since, it's been like<br> looking through a bowl of milk.<br> Bouriette.<br> Bouriette!<br> - What is it, Antoine?<br> - Come here.!<br> Look!<br> Bernadette told them there was a spring,<br> and they called her insane.<br> Look at it, Bouriette!<br> Look at it!<br> - Tell the others. Hurry!<br> - Bouhouhorts! La Grange!<br> Bouhouhorts! La Grange!<br> Come back! Look!<br> #Santa Maria #<br> #Mater dei ##<br> Dr. Dozous!<br> Where is the doctor?<br> Dr. Dozous.<br> Dr. Dozous, my eye. I can see!<br> I put mud on them from the grotto,<br> and now I can see. It's a miracle.<br> - Don't be in such a hurry<br> with your miracles.<br> - It's a miracle.<br> Tomorrow at 2:00,<br> Madame Blanche. Come here.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Fix your eye on the ceiling<br> and look straight ahead.<br> - All I did was put mud<br> on them from the grotto.<br> - Be quiet.<br> - Then I said a prayer. Now I can see.<br> - Quiet.<br> - It's a miracle, Doctor. It's a miracle!<br> - Be still.<br> There's no improvement<br> in this eye, Bouriette.<br> Four scars on the cornea.<br> - Same as it was six months ago.<br> - But I can see!<br> It's like sheet lightning.<br> Excuse me.<br> Doctor, everything is bright.<br> What you've done is pressed<br> against the eyeball so hard...<br> you've irritated<br> the optic nerve.<br> For a time, things will seem bright,<br> but that'll pass.<br> - Take a look at that chart.<br> - Yes.<br> - Can you read it with your left eye?<br> - No, Doctor, I can't.<br> - How 'bout the right?<br> - No, no, I can't.<br> - How 'bout both eyes?<br> - No good, Doctor.<br> - There you are.<br> - But, Doctor, I never knew how to read.<br> But I can see!<br> I can see you, Doctor!<br> I can see everything!<br> It's a miracle.<br> - Come back tomorrow when<br> you're calmer, Bouriette.<br> - All right, but it's a miracle!<br> It's a miracle!<br> It's a miracle!<br> I understand it all now.<br> Ever since that piece<br> of marble flew in my eye...<br> she's been trying to find<br> a way to make it up to me.<br> And at last she did.<br> - Mortar.<br> - You can see better now, Bouriette?<br> I see everything!<br> - There's no hope.<br> - No. No.<br> Charles, get Louise Soubirous.<br> She has always saved him before.<br> - She's not at home. I can't find her.<br> - It's too late.<br> It's better so.<br> You don't want your child<br> to drag himself through life<br> a hopeless cripple, do you?<br> I want my child to live!<br> No. No!<br> Croisine.<br> Croisine!<br> Croisine, come back!<br> - Somebody's coming.<br> - Who is it?<br> Where? I don't see anything.<br> Croisine.<br> Croisine, please.<br> - Croisine, be sensible.<br> - Let me be.<br> Are you mad?<br> Take him, Oh Lord,<br> or give him back to me.<br> Well, Doctor?<br> There can be no question<br> of innervation.<br> I can find no reason to doubt<br> the presence of muscular substance.<br> What does that mean, Doctor?<br> That means that yesterday the baby's<br> legs were completely paralyzed.<br> And today,<br> they're as sound as yours.<br> I'm sure you can understand now<br> my anxiety...<br> for confirmation<br> of my findings.<br> You're positive there's not<br> a possibility of error<br> in your previous diagnosis?<br> "August 25.<br> "High temperature,<br> violent convulsions...<br> complete paralysis<br> of the legs."<br> - Couldn't we assume a<br> mere atrophy due to rickets?<br> - I couldn't.<br> Then the water<br> at Massabielle must contain...<br> an unknown and powerful<br> therapeutic substance.<br> At any rate, I must report on this case<br> to the medical journals.<br> Mmm, I'd hesitate<br> to do that.<br> It might make you<br> an object of ridicule.<br> It won't be an easy thing<br> to write.<br> I'm not accustomed<br> to believing things I can't see.<br> What about you, Father?<br> You've been very silent.<br> What do you make<br> of all this?<br> Unlike a doctor...<br> a religious must believe<br> a great many things he cannot see.<br> Sometimes, I confess,<br> it's extremely difficult.<br> Last night when I came here,<br> it was very dark.<br> It's much lighter now.<br> Good morning, gentlemen.<br> And no longer<br> are his legs like dishrags.<br> Now they're<br> firm and strong.<br> And without Bernadette,<br> it couldn't have been!<br> - Let me say a prayer by her bedside.<br> - Heavenly Father, no!<br> Save your prayers for mass.<br> Now go home to your wife.<br> Tonight you will all<br> have dinner with us.<br> We will have an omelette<br> ten-feet wide!<br> Good morning, maman.!<br> Good morning, Papa.<br> Morning, Bernadette.<br> Good morning,<br> Bernadette.<br> Then she held him<br> in that ice-cold water...<br> and all of a sudden,<br> the baby began to cry.<br> Not a weak, sickly cry,<br> but a healthy one.<br> And both doctors agree<br> a great change took place.<br> They confess<br> they can't understand it.<br> It's left them wondering.<br> What do you think of it,<br> Father?<br> I too am wondering.<br> Do you know, the baby<br> was never strong enough to cry before.<br> Then on the way home, the child<br> went to sleep in his mother's arms.<br> When he woke up,<br> he was smiling and hungry.<br> He was moving his legs.<br> Almost since he was born,<br> his legs were as if they had no muscles.<br> - Oh.<br> - This is awful.<br> Yes, Commissioner.<br> At sunrise, that whole hillside<br> will look like a sugar loaf<br> crawling with ants.<br> - It won't be so bad after tomorrow.<br> - Why?<br> The Lady only asked her to come<br> for 15 times. Tomorrow makes 15.<br> This is no longer a curiosity.<br> It's a disease! This crowd<br> will come if she's here or not.<br> - Where do you think you are going?<br> - No place, monsieur.<br> - What have you got in that basket?<br> - My wife is very sick.<br> - You've got your wife in the basket?<br> - No, monsieur, l...<br> I thought maybe I could sell<br> some hot chestnuts and wine.<br> There you are!<br> Now it's started.<br> Pretty soon<br> they'll be selling sausages.<br> You want sausage?<br> I've got sausage too.<br> Go. Go on.<br> Move.<br> #Santa Maria #<br> #Mater dei #<br> #Santa Maria #<br> #Mater dei ##<br> Who is this Lady?<br> She must have a name.<br> Didn't you ask her<br> her name?<br> - I've told you to time and time again.<br> - Now it's too late.<br> I did ask her today.<br> - Well?<br> - What she said I didn't understand.<br> - Speak. What was it?<br> - You haven't forgotten?<br> No, I repeated it many times,<br> so I wouldn't forget.<br> She said, "I am<br> the Immaculate Conception."<br> Immaculate Conception?<br> Immaculate Conception.<br> Do you know what it means, "I am<br> the Immaculate Conception"?<br> Don't be afraid, my child.<br> I sent for you to help you,<br> not to scold you.<br> Well?<br> No, Your Reverence.<br> I do not know what it means.<br> Do you know the meaning<br> of the word "immaculate"?<br> Yes, I know that.<br> An immaculate thing is clean.<br> Good.<br> And "conception"?<br> Well, we'll leave that<br> for the moment.<br> Do you know what we mean<br> when we speak of the Original Sin?<br> Yes. The Original Sin<br> was committed by Adam and Eve...<br> when they did not remain<br> faithful to God, but broke His command.<br> Father Pomian<br> taught you that, didn't he?<br> Now, think hard.<br> Didn't he also speak<br> of the Immaculate Conception?<br> No, Father,<br> I never mentioned that dogma.<br> It doesn't belong to the pedagogic<br> material of the elementary class.<br> - Perhaps Sister Vauzous discussed it.<br> - I'm sure she didn't.<br> You must've heard<br> the expression somewhere.<br> Now try to remember.<br> Maybe I've heard<br> about it...<br> but I don't remember.<br> Very well.<br> I'll try to explain it.<br> The Most Blessed<br> Virgin Mary...<br> was preserved free from<br> all stain of Original Sin.<br> Even from the first instant<br> of her presence in her mother's womb.<br> God did this for her because she was<br> to be the mother ofJesus Christ...<br> the most singular<br> privilege of grace.<br> Do you understand that,<br> Bernadette?<br> No, Your Reverence.<br> Why should you?<br> Great scholars have wracked<br> their brains about it for centuries.<br> But perhaps you can grasp<br> this one thing.<br> If the Most Blessed Virgin<br> were to speak...<br> she could not say of herself,<br> "I am the Immaculate Conception."<br> All she could say would be, "I am the<br> fruit of the Immaculate Conception."<br> Birth and conception<br> are events...<br> but a person<br> is not an event.<br> You can't say, "I am<br> conception. I am birth."<br> Consequently, your lady is guilty<br> of an inexcusable blunder.<br> You must admit that.<br> So next time I see her,<br> I will tell her, Your Reverence.<br> - Excuse me, Father. I promised<br> to look in on Madame Cenac.<br> - Certainly.<br> - Good-bye, Bernadette.<br> - Good-bye, Father Pomian.<br> What am I to do with you,<br> Bernadette?<br> Your eyes seem honest,<br> your words sincere.<br> Yet I cannot believe you.<br> Today less than ever.<br> As your confessor, I beseech you,<br> renounce this falsehood.<br> Confess that your mother or your father<br> or your aunt or someone...<br> suggested that phrase that you might<br> become important in men's eyes.<br> But I can't confess that.<br> It isn't true.<br> No one suggested<br> anything to me.<br> Have you ever thought about your life?<br> What your future would be like?<br> Like the future<br> of all the girls hereabout.<br> After First Communion,<br> girls may indulge in proper pleasures.<br> They go to dances,<br> to festivals, meet young men.<br> And after a time,<br> to please God...<br> they marry<br> and have children.<br> Wouldn't you like<br> to be such a girl?<br> Oh, yes! I'd like to go to dances,<br> have a husband someday.<br> Then wake up!<br> Now!<br> Otherwise life<br> is at an end for you.<br> You are playing with fire,<br> Bernadette.<br> - Commissioner,<br> that spring at the grotto...<br> - Yeah?<br> The people are drinking<br> quite a bit of that water, aren't they?<br> By the bucketful.<br> What they don't drink, they carry away<br> in pots and pans and bottles.<br> Well, they're still at it.<br> You thought it was bad before,<br> you ought to take a look at it now.<br> Sick, lame, canes, crutches.<br> Some even look like lepers.<br> Listen to this, Commissioner.<br> "December 22, 1789.<br> "All waters contained<br> in springs, wells, streams, rivers...<br> "or any other source whatsoever,<br> shall not be consumed<br> by anyone whosoever...<br> until the aforementioned waters<br> have been thoroughly analyzed<br> by a registered chemist."<br> That's perfect!<br> You know, I had a feeling<br> that somewhere in all these books...<br> I'd find one old law<br> that would suit our purpose.<br> Shall I send my men out<br> to close the grotto now?<br> Not so fast, Commissioner.<br> First we'll take this to the mayor.<br> And he will issue<br> a proclamation.<br> Come in.<br> Ah, come in, gentlemen.!<br> Thank you. I have good news.<br> The holocaust will spread no more.<br> - I have found a way to stop it.<br> - Our troubles are over.<br> And ironically enough,<br> it's the waters of Massabielle<br> that will quench this fire.<br> It's an old law. 1789.<br> Look there. Read it.<br> "In the interest<br> of public health..."<br> Of course, with such<br> an important analysis...<br> we'll have to have the opinions<br> of many chemists.<br> And that might take<br> months and months and months.<br> I wonder...<br> I wonder if we're not being<br> a little too hasty in this.<br> Perhaps we're shortsighted...<br> in dismissing the possibility of<br> divine power in regard to Massabielle.<br> For after all, I'm sure that<br> you gentlemen as well as I...<br> do not want to oppose<br> the will of God.<br> Your sudden religious fervor<br> is most touching, Your Honor.<br> Could it be prompted by the fact<br> that the devout masses...<br> have brought with them<br> a wave of prosperity to Lourdes?<br> Monsieur!<br> But now that you mention it,<br> we shouldn't overlook that either.<br> Our hotels are filled,<br> our cafes are crowded...<br> and our shopkeepers<br> have never known such business.<br> And the railroad is sure<br> to take advantage of this influx<br> of visitors to Lourdes...<br> and extend its line here.<br> Yes, yes. And in that case<br> we shall need more hotels.<br> But aside from all that...<br> I'm thinking mainly<br> of the thousands of pilgrims...<br> who come here daily<br> with hope in their hearts.<br> If they derive any benefit<br> from the water at Massabielle...<br> who are we<br> to deprive them of it?<br> Then too, think of the vast number<br> who cannot come to Lourdes.<br> For them, we could bottle<br> the miraculous water...<br> and it could be sold,<br> at a nominal fee, all over the world!<br> Your Honor, will you dictate<br> the proclamation to close the grotto...<br> or would you rather<br> that I contact Baron Massy...<br> and ask for permission<br> to do it myself?<br> Very well, I'll do it.<br> But I think you gentlemen<br> are making a big mistake.<br> Why not think it over<br> for a time?<br> Courreges, take a proclamation.<br> Oh, come in, Commissioner.<br> Any trouble?<br> Oh, no. We finally wiped out<br> this epidemic.<br> No, Commissioner. To wipe out an<br> epidemic you must eliminate the cause.<br> I'll have the grotto patrolled night<br> and day. Nothing can happen now.<br> Perhaps nothing can happen<br> at the grotto.<br> However since the Lady is merely<br> a figment of Bernadette's imagination...<br> she can see her anyplace... beside the<br> river, in the hovel where she lives...<br> or if she wishes,<br> on the very steps of the city hall.<br> - What?<br> - The next fence we build<br> must be around her imagination.<br> Have you ever heard<br> of Dr. DeBoe?<br> - Yes!<br> - I've just written him asking him<br> to come to Lourdes for a few days.<br> Just a moment. Come along. The<br> imperial prosecutor wants to see you.<br> - You can't take her! She's done nothing!<br> - Come on.<br> I'll go, maman.<br> Don't worry. It won't be long.<br> Why must you keep plaguing her?<br> She's tired and ill!<br> - Leave her alone!<br> - Please!<br> I never felt that Dr. Dozous's<br> examination of the girl<br> was extensive enough.<br> Well, after all, Dr. Dozous<br> is a general practitioner.<br> The advances in psychiatry<br> have been so rapid...<br> that only a specialist could<br> hope to keep up with them.<br> Oh, do you think the girl<br> is insane, monsieur?<br> My dear Doctor, I am a great respecter<br> of medical science.<br> Therefore I think that as a layman,<br> I am not qualified to have an opinion.<br> However, I do think that<br> the bare facts of the case...<br> should be permitted<br> to speak for themselves.<br> Day after day, she stood<br> before a hole in a rock...<br> and conversed<br> with the Blessed Virgin.<br> Such delusions<br> are a usual symptom of paranoia.<br> I have many paranoiacs<br> in my clinic who claim visions...<br> oftentimes followed<br> by a tendency towards violence.<br> Has this girl been allowed<br> to come and go as she pleases?<br> Well, I had planned<br> to put her under restraint...<br> but of course Dr. Dozous's favorable<br> diagnosis made that impossible.<br> Tiens.!<br> I trust that your examination, Doctor,<br> will not be a cursory one.<br> I can assure you,<br> it will be most extensive.<br> It may even be necessary<br> to place the child in an<br> institution under observation.<br> And unfortunately,<br> with paranoiacs, observation<br> sometimes takes a long time.<br> After all, a psychiatrist is not<br> an orthopedic surgeon...<br> who can set a broken bone<br> on the spot.<br> Yes, yes, I understand.<br> Come in.<br> Eyes closed.<br> Now the other foot.<br> Why are you so unsteady?<br> Because I'm very tired,<br> monsieur.<br> All right.<br> You may sit down now.<br> - How many hours in the day?<br> - Twenty-four.<br> - How many days in the week?<br> - Seven.<br> How much<br> is seven times five?<br> Thirty-five.<br> How much<br> is 17 times 18?<br> I do not know, monsieur.<br> Very well.<br> Would you know the answer, monsieur,<br> if you hadn't figured it out before?<br> Hmm?<br> Not so fast, young lady.<br> Don't bother. She'll go directly home.<br> We can take her from there.<br> Here we are, Doctor.<br> Father Peyramale.<br> Have I the honor of addressing<br> the Dean of Lourdes?<br> You have that honor.<br> How can I serve you?<br> Hadn't we better go elsewhere<br> and discuss this matter?<br> It is you gentlemen who have chosen<br> this place of action, not I.<br> What do you want here?<br> I'm here on behalf<br> of the Medical Department of<br> the Provincial Administration.<br> There are evidences of definite<br> anomalies in this girl, Bernadette...<br> and I wish to place her<br> under observation.<br> I'm a professor of psychiatry<br> and neurology at the clinic ofTarbes.<br> If the girl does not willingly<br> submit to this examination...<br> we will be placed in the unfortunate<br> position of being forced...<br> to invoke the law of 1838.<br> This is the most shameless piece<br> of hypocrisy I have ever encountered.<br> I warn you.<br> I shall expose this hypocrisy.<br> And I shall raise such a voice<br> throughout all France...<br> the reverberations will send petty<br> politicians toppling from their seats.<br> Come here, Bernadette.<br> I know this child.<br> So does the imperial prosecutor.<br> She is neither a maniac<br> nor a menace to her fellowmen.<br> If you still intend to take her,<br> gentlemen, well and good.<br> But rest assured,<br> I shall not stir from this girl's side.<br> Now, call the police.<br> And when the police<br> do come, what then?<br> When they come,<br> I shall say to them...<br> "Load well your guns, for your path<br> lies over my dead body."<br> Well?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Come, Bernadette.<br> Mother Superior has asked me<br> to watch over you.<br> I'm sorry to have<br> caused you this trouble.<br> I welcome the opportunity of talking<br> to you before I leave Lourdes.<br> - You're leaving?<br> - Tomorrow.<br> I've been recalled to the Mother<br> House of our Lord of Nevers.<br> The Dean of Lourdes is<br> on his way to speak to the<br> Bishop ofTarbes in your behalf.<br> I want you to know that although<br> you used your wiles successfully<br> on a great many people...<br> one person remains<br> who does not believe you.<br> That person is myself.<br> I've never wanted you<br> to believe me, Sister.<br> If that is one of those<br> disarming answers of yours...<br> that is supposed<br> to strike one silent...<br> you need not<br> waste it on me.<br> You should be thankful, Bernadette,<br> you did not live in former times.<br> Creatures who boasted<br> of equivocal visions...<br> and produced springs<br> as if by magic...<br> were burned at the stake.<br> I have prayed for you...<br> night after night,<br> and I shall continue...<br> so that your soul<br> may not be destroyed...<br> by the frightful danger<br> to which you are exposing it.<br> - And now good night, Bernadette.<br> - Good night, Sister.<br> However, above all that,<br> I come in the cause of justice.<br> The authorities are scheming<br> and plotting this girl's destruction.<br> It is not the practice of the Church<br> to interfere with the authorities.<br> And particularly in the case<br> of Bernadette Soubirous...<br> we will rigidly adhere to<br> our policy of remaining aloof.<br> In my opinion, a change<br> in our policy is now necessary.<br> That opinion is not shared<br> by an amazing number<br> of equally worthy ecclesiastics.<br> I realize that. I also realize that none<br> but myself has talked to this child.<br> I've begun to wonder if she is<br> not a true vessel of grace<br> and a worker of miracles.<br> Oh, stop!<br> My dear Dean...<br> only the Congregation of Rights can<br> determine whether a given phenomenon...<br> is a genuine miracle<br> or a deception.<br> True.<br> That's all I ask.<br> That an Episcopal Commission<br> be set up to investigate.<br> Two or three questionable cures are not<br> sufficient to cause an investigation.<br> One questionable cure was<br> sufficient to cause a multitude<br> to travel hundreds of miles.<br> Very well.<br> - I will convoke such a commission.<br> - Thank you.<br> Providing certain obstacles<br> can be surmounted.<br> You fully realize,<br> of course...<br> just what<br> this will mean?<br> The commission can render<br> only one of three decisions.<br> First, you're an impostor,<br> little Soubirous.<br> Hence away with you<br> to a prison for juvenile delinquents.<br> Second, you're a madwoman,<br> little Soubirous.<br> Away with you to an asylum.<br> - Third...<br> - You are the rarest of<br> mortal beings, little Soubirous.<br> Just when do you think<br> the commission will begin its work?<br> The scientists,<br> the chemists, the geologists...<br> cannot possibly conduct their<br> researches with the grotto boarded up.<br> - A letter from you<br> will force them to open it.<br> - No.<br> The emperor must command<br> that the grotto be opened.<br> Then the commission may assemble.<br> Not the other way around.<br> - When will you ask the emperor?<br> - Never.<br> I've not the slightest<br> intention of mentioning it.<br> He will not know that I even<br> contemplate convoking the commission.<br> - My attitude puzzles you, doesn't it?<br> - Frankly, yes.<br> I am giving your lady a chance<br> to prove herself to me.<br> If she is the Blessed Virgin,<br> then nothing is impossible for her...<br> and she will overcome<br> the emperor.<br> However, if she is overcome,<br> then she's a fraud.<br> The grotto will remain<br> boarded up...<br> and she and any thought of the<br> commission will vanish into thin air.<br> I wonder,<br> my dear Dean, who will win...<br> the emperor or the lady.<br> Stay where you are.!<br> You're under arrest.<br> Go down. I'll watch them<br> from here.<br> - Name, age, occupation.<br> - Jacques Gozos, 46, carpenter.<br> - Charge?<br> - Stealing water from Massabielle.<br> - One franc and costs.<br> - But I haven't got it, monsieur.<br> Two days in jail then.<br> Take him away.<br> - Next case.<br> - Bruat. Woman.<br> Bruat! Woman.<br> - Name, age and occupation.<br> - Bruat, Leontine, 34, governess.<br> Commissioner.<br> Bruat? Madame, are you by any chance<br> related to Admiral Bruat?<br> - He's my husband.<br> - Oh. I am Vital Dutour,<br> the imperial prosecutor.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Won't you come into my office<br> and sit down? Please.<br> I was arrested and led through<br> the streets, the same as the rest.<br> I do not wish to be treated<br> differently now that I'm here.<br> Madame, this is most distressing.<br> You are the bearer of a great name.<br> When ladies of your station<br> exhibit to the masses...<br> their utter contempt<br> for the law by breaking it...<br> what is the poor<br> civil servant to do?<br> - Punish them the same<br> as you would the others.<br> - Very well, madame.<br> I am forced to require you<br> to pay a fine of one franc and costs.<br> Delighted, monsieur.<br> And here are a hundred more<br> for my fellow criminals<br> who are without funds.<br> And now, please,<br> may I have the bottle?<br> The bottle is confiscated.<br> But I don't believe<br> it remains so, monsieur...<br> for I filled it at the desire of a<br> very high personage.<br> May I ask who<br> this personage is, madame?<br> Her Majesty,<br> the empress Eugenie.<br> I have the honor to be the governess<br> of His Highness, the prince imperial.<br> Take it, madame.<br> I begin to see the folly of<br> being the only one to do one's<br> duty in a feebleminded world.<br> Madame.<br> His temperature<br> is quite normal now.<br> Oh, thank God.<br> I was right.<br> The water is miraculous.<br> I'm sure it is, madame.<br> Loulou, my darling.<br> You'll be well now, my sweet.<br> Louis.<br> Loulou is better.<br> The water from Lourdes made him well.<br> Let us say, sire, the waters<br> did the prince no harm.<br> He had only a slight cold.<br> How can you say that?<br> His forehead was on fire with fever.<br> Never more than<br> two degrees, madame.<br> It was diphtheria<br> or scarlet fever. I know it. I feel it.<br> Please, my dearest,<br> don't excite yourself.<br> Come and sit down.<br> Loulou has had a number of attacks<br> like this and he's always gotten well.<br> I tell you, Louis.<br> It was the water that saved him.<br> That's a very frivolous<br> observation, darling.<br> You're doing a great injustice<br> to the doctor's prescriptions.<br> - You're an atheist, Louis.<br> - That's the most stupid thing<br> a sovereign could be.<br> Then you're worse<br> than an atheist.<br> You haven't the humility to thank God<br> for the grace he's accorded us.<br> By order of<br> His Majesty, the emperor...<br> the ordinance of May 10 is hereby<br> revoked and nullified as of this date.<br> The grotto shall be opened.<br> Signed, Louis Napoleon.<br> I must say, my dear Dean...<br> your lady wastes<br> no time in accepting a challenge.<br> The lady has had sweet revenge.<br> I'm being, uh, transferred to Alais.<br> Perhaps I should say<br> demoted to Alais.<br> Yes, I rather expected<br> you would be.<br> I, too, received<br> a letter this morning.<br> Yeah? What hole<br> are you headed for?<br> In my case, the lady wanted<br> even sweeter revenge.<br> I'm to stay here...<br> for a while at least.<br> Watch the thing I fought against<br> blossom like a fruit tree.<br> It's the influenza again.<br> I can feel it.<br> Evidently her lady intends<br> to leave me exactly as she found me.<br> - Some hot wine, Duran.<br> - Oui, monsieur.<br> And then I ran<br> to the other side...<br> and ate of the grass and the herbs,<br> as the Lady had asked me to.<br> I can't understand the Lady demanding<br> anything so repulsive of you.<br> It doesn't fit into the description<br> that you gave of her...<br> that she bade you<br> act like an animal.<br> Do you act like an animal<br> when you eat salad?<br> Go on.<br> Then I looked for the spring.<br> Since I couldn't see it,<br> I supposed the Lady meant<br> that it was below the ground.<br> So I began to scratch<br> and dig with my fingers.<br> To be considered a miracle,<br> a healing must be as sudden<br> as a bolt of lightning.<br> It must be from<br> one moment to the next.<br> Further proof is necessary.<br> When I looked for the spring,<br> since I could not see it...<br> I supposed the Lady meant<br> that it was below the ground.<br> So I began to scratch<br> and dig with my fingers.<br> Then I looked for the spring.<br> Since I could not see it...<br> I supposed the Lady meant<br> that it was below the ground.<br> So I began to scratch<br> and dig with my fingers.<br> There is still the<br> possibility of deception.<br> Further proof is necessary.<br> The evidence is insufficient.<br> Come in, Bernadette.<br> I'm sorry to be late,<br> Your Reverence...<br> - but my brother came in<br> with a frostbitten nose.<br> - Come by the fire.<br> - I had to rub snow on it.<br> - March is coming in<br> like a lion, isn't it?<br> - Sit down, Bernadette.<br> - Oh, thank you, Father.<br> I'm sorry I was unable to attend<br> your sister's wedding on Thursday.<br> - Father Pomian tells me it was lovely.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> We had lots of cakes.<br> One with figures on it.<br> It was ever so nice.<br> Now I suppose she'll be giving up<br> her position with Madame Millet.<br> Yes, they're going<br> to live on a farm.<br> But Madame Millet's<br> going to take me as housemaid.<br> So I heard today.<br> - That's why I wanted to talk to you.<br> - Oh, it's not hard work.<br> And the pay is good.<br> You know...<br> it's strange, Your Reverence.<br> The Lady once told me<br> I could never be happy in this world...<br> but I am.<br> Happier than I've ever been.<br> I've got a position. And...<br> And Monsieur Antoine<br> is a splendid young man.<br> Bernadette...<br> have you any idea of what the bishop's<br> commission has been doing?<br> Oh, yes. The gentlemen have<br> examined and tested...<br> - all the people who have been cured.<br> - That's true.<br> What of yourself? Don't you<br> think that you and your case<br> are part of their task also?<br> I've answered all<br> the gentlemen's questions.<br> I hope they won't<br> ask me any more.<br> The commission is now engaged<br> in writing a very important<br> report about you.<br> It admits the possibility that you were<br> chosen by the Powers Above...<br> and that your hand alone brought<br> forth the spring responsible<br> for miraculous cures.<br> - Don't you understand what that means?<br> - No.<br> It means that the greatest<br> and the wisest men in the Church...<br> will be watching you<br> for decades.<br> And then, perhaps long after the rest<br> of us are dead and thought of no more...<br> - you will...<br> - This is dreadful.<br> I don't want it.<br> It can't be.<br> It's no small matter.<br> No, no. No.<br> Tell me, aren't the sisters<br> in the hospital and<br> in the school good and kind?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, they are.<br> They're very sweet.<br> Could you imagine yourself<br> as one of them someday?<br> Dear God, no.<br> That's far above me.<br> I just want to go and work for<br> Madame Millet as housemaid. Please.<br> My dear child.<br> To you, the Most Blessed Virgin<br> condescended.<br> This places<br> a responsibility on you.<br> You can't suddenly play truant<br> and run away from your destiny...<br> as though it were school<br> and become an old widow's servant.<br> A long time ago I told you you were<br> playing with fire, Bernadette.<br> Your Lady was<br> heavenly fire.<br> Heaven chose you.<br> And now there's nothing left for you<br> but to choose heaven.<br> - Isn't that true?<br> - Yes.<br> You'll like the life<br> with the sisters at Nevers.<br> Their order is<br> beautiful and lofty...<br> and very much involved<br> in practical life.<br> Everything you have said<br> is true, Your Reverence.<br> And I will do<br> exactly as you say.<br> But...<br> You're worried<br> about your family?<br> You needn't.<br> You may stay<br> with them until summer.<br> It'll take that long before<br> the report is fully complete.<br> And I've arranged for your<br> father to be established in<br> the mill on the upper Lapaca.<br> There he can practice the trade<br> for which he was meant.<br> Your family can live<br> without fear of poverty.<br> No, no, no, no, no.<br> Bernadette.<br> Just one moment.<br> I've something more to say.<br> Although, as a member of<br> the commission, I shouldn't say it.<br> Now, mind you,<br> I have full faith in you...<br> but there's always been one<br> small detail which I never<br> could help but doubt.<br> It's the words<br> "Immaculate Conception."<br> If you could ever admit<br> that this phrase...<br> was not spoken<br> by the Lady...<br> things might be<br> very different.<br> If you could retract<br> this single incident...<br> then there might be, somewhere<br> in this world, a little corner...<br> where you could hide<br> and lead a normal life.<br> Would you like a little time<br> to think it over?<br> I don't need time,<br> Your Reverence...<br> because I've never<br> lied to you.<br> Did I speak of lying?<br> And...<br> I don't want<br> a little corner to hide in.<br> Good day,<br> Your Reverence.<br> Bernadette.<br> May the patron saint of travelers<br> watch over you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - A Saint Christopher.<br> That's what we gave her!<br> Two will make<br> my journey doubly safe.<br> Go along, junior.<br> Go along.<br> Go on, junior.<br> I don't want to say it.<br> It sounds silly.<br> You owe your life to Bernadette.<br> You say it exactly as I taught you.<br> We're going to<br> miss you, Bernadette.<br> - I'm going to miss you too.<br> - Will the nuns...<br> Bernadette, if I live to be a hundred,<br> I shall never forget this hour.<br> For it was you who snatched<br> me from the jaws of death<br> and made all my... Here.<br> A Saint Christopher.<br> How thoughtful.<br> Well, well, well,<br> Bernadette.<br> I shall be<br> only a moment.<br> I'm sorry to be late, but<br> it was unavoidable. I was<br> making a speech at the depot.<br> So my old and dear friend<br> is leaving Lourdes.<br> Bernadette, never will I<br> forget those first days<br> of trial and tribulation...<br> when practically we alone<br> stood side by side,<br> facing a doubting world.<br> - Always will I remember...<br> - Pardon me, Your Honor...<br> but the sisters in the carriage<br> grow impatient.<br> - Huh?<br> - And I've not yet said<br> good-bye to my family.<br> - Oh.<br> - Will you excuse me?<br> Certainly. Certainly.<br> This is merely something<br> to enjoy on your journey.<br> - Oh, thank you, monsieur.<br> - A-And this.<br> May the ever-watching patron saint<br> of travel hover over your carriage...<br> - and guide you safely<br> to your destination.<br> - Thank you, monsieur.<br> I... wanted to say<br> good-bye in here.<br> Keep well wrapped-up.<br> And remember that you...<br> Maman, I don't<br> need this shawl.<br> Nonsense. It'll be very windy.<br> With your asthma...<br> Louise...<br> this is no time<br> to talk about shawls.<br> There's so much to say<br> and so little time to say it.<br> W-When the time comes,<br> one can say nothing.<br> One can only feel.<br> - Good-bye, Papa.<br> - Good-bye, my child.<br> Good-bye, maman.<br> Good-bye, Bernadette.<br> Say good-bye to<br> Madame Nicolau and...<br> and her son.<br> Please, dear Sisters,<br> I know you've waited so long...<br> but may I have<br> another moment?<br> - We must reach Toulouse before dark.<br> - Oh, nothing can happen to us.<br> Look, I have enough protection<br> for even the horses.<br> Very well, but hurry.<br> I said good-bye<br> once this morning, I know.<br> But I have a little<br> something for you.<br> - Don't worry. It's not<br> a Saint Christopher.<br> You have only four.<br> I blessed five this morning.<br> Someone must be late.<br> Bernadette...<br> sometimes to express certain things<br> in a letter is difficult.<br> So, wherever you may go,<br> if ever you should need me...<br> just send me this.<br> I shall understand<br> and come immediately.<br> Your Reverence...<br> if only you knew<br> how much this means to me.<br> Good-bye.<br> Good-bye, Bernadette,<br> and God bless you.<br> For you, mademoiselle.<br> Oh, monsieur,<br> they are so beautiful.<br> I didn't come to say good-bye<br> with the others because...<br> there was something<br> I wanted to tell you.<br> What was it,<br> Monsieur Antoine?<br> Well, I, uh...<br> I wanted to say...<br> Well, my mother<br> is getting old.<br> She and I are used to each other.<br> We get along very well.<br> So I've decided<br> never to take a wife.<br> Because, uh, a mother-in-law<br> and a daughter-in-law...<br> Well, that doesn't<br> work out so well.<br> I'm going to stay<br> unmarried too.<br> Well, that's what<br> I wanted to say to you.<br> Now I wish you luck<br> on your journey, Bernadette.<br> Good-bye, Antoine.<br> - You are the postulant from Lourdes?<br> - Yes, Mother Superior.<br> What is your name?<br> Soubirous.<br> Bernadette Soubirous.<br> - How old are you?<br> - Just past 20.<br> What can you do?<br> Oh, nothing<br> that amounts to much.<br> In the world, what would you have<br> liked to have been?<br> I always thought<br> I could have been a good servant girl.<br> - Is that you, Sister Marie-Therese?<br> - Yes, Mother Superior.<br> This is the mistress of the novices,<br> to whose guidance you'll look.<br> This is Bernadette Soubirous,<br> a new postulant.<br> We know each other.<br> The postulant will start<br> in the kitchen tomorrow.<br> You will be asked<br> to wash dishes...<br> scrub floors,<br> sweep corridors.<br> In brief, do all the lowly tasks<br> that need to be done.<br> But please observe, I do not command<br> you. I am merely proposing this.<br> If you do not feel equal to it,<br> or if such work is repellent to you...<br> physically or spiritually,<br> I wish you would say so now.<br> Oh, no, Mother Superior,<br> I'm very happy to work in the kitchen.<br> Good. Sister Marie-Therese<br> will show you to your cell.<br> With your permission,<br> Mother Superior...<br> there is one other matter<br> to be considered.<br> The postulant bears a name which<br> has made a great noise in the world.<br> But, among us,<br> great names have no meaning.<br> Although they may have been acquired<br> through far greater effort...<br> we disassociate ourselves from all<br> we may have meant to the world...<br> and all it<br> has meant to us.<br> Moreover,<br> the name Bernadette...<br> is a childish<br> and trivial diminutive.<br> Quite right.<br> Before actually entering<br> upon your novitiate...<br> you will want<br> to choose another name.<br> Under the circumstances,<br> it would be best to do so now.<br> - Have you given the matter any thought?<br> - No, I haven't.<br> - What was your godmother's name?<br> - Bernarde.<br> Then, surely, you'll be happy to bear<br> the name of Marie-Bernarde, my child.<br> This way, Marie-Bernarde.<br> The cell is not to your liking,<br> Marie-Bernarde?<br> Oh, yes, Sister.<br> It is quite to my liking.<br> You will learn to be<br> comfortable in it.<br> A convent is no prison.<br> No force is exercised here.<br> If you do not feel capable<br> of our obedience...<br> you will find<br> the door is always open.<br> Good night,<br> Marie-Bernarde.<br> Good night, Sister.<br> - Marie-Bernarde.<br> - Yes, Sister?<br> What are you thinking about?<br> - About my family.<br> - Worldly remembrances<br> have no place in this house.<br> We're here for the purpose<br> of concentration, not for<br> reverie and woolgathering.<br> Yes, Sister.<br> You find this work repellent?<br> - Oh, no, Sister.<br> - Then let's show our<br> willingness to serve God...<br> - and not hesitate in our tasks.<br> - Yes, Sister.<br> - Sister Marie-Bernarde is limping.<br> - Yes, I've noticed it.<br> I'm afraid it is a worldly desire<br> to become the center of attention.<br> I shall speak to her.<br> Sister Marie-Bernarde.<br> - Come here, please.<br> - Yes, Sister.<br> I wish to speak with you.<br> Certainly, Sister.<br> Would you have me finish prayers first?<br> What I have to say to<br> you is just as important for your soul.<br> - We will speak in your cell.<br> - Yes, Sister.<br> Excuse me, Mother Superior.<br> Sit down, Marie-Bernarde.<br> I've been wanting<br> to talk to you for a long time.<br> - Why do you limp?<br> - Oh, it's nothing, Sister.<br> Limping gains sympathy<br> from the other sisters, is that it?<br> - But I never...<br> - You forget. I've known<br> you for many years.<br> In the outside world<br> you were celebrated.<br> From all over France,<br> people came just to gaze upon you.<br> Here, you are a nonentity.<br> - You find that difficult<br> to bear, don't you?<br> - Oh, no.<br> The temptation to cling to your eminence<br> is undoubtedly too strong for you.<br> Truly, Sister...<br> never have I said<br> or done anything to attract attention.<br> I wish only to be<br> one of the sisters here, nothing more.<br> Ten years ago, I was<br> forced to doubt you. I have not changed.<br> I have never<br> told you an untruth.<br> I have tried to believe you.<br> Only God knows<br> how hard I've tried, but I cannot.<br> What is it<br> you don't believe?<br> What everyone else<br> is willing to believe.<br> The Lady?<br> Oh, I did see her.<br> I did.<br> Many agree with you, even<br> the Holy Father in Rome.<br> But I do not. I cannot.<br> What do you know<br> of suffering?<br> Nothing.<br> In all our sacred history...<br> the chosen ones have always<br> been those who have suffered.<br> Why, then, should God<br> choose you? Why not me?<br> I cannot answer that.<br> I know what it is to suffer.<br> Look at my eyes.<br> They burn like<br> the very fires of hell.<br> Why?<br> Because they need sleep.<br> They need rest,<br> which I will not give them.<br> My throat is parched<br> from constant prayer.<br> My hands are gnarled from<br> serving God in humiliation.<br> My body is pain-wracked<br> from stone floors.<br> Yes, I have suffered because I know<br> it is the only true road to heaven.<br> And if I, who have tortured myself,<br> cannot glimpse the Blessed Virgin...<br> how can you, who have never felt pain,<br> dare to say you've seen her?<br> I don't know why<br> I was chosen.<br> You are a hundred times<br> more worthy.<br> If only I could find evidence.<br> If only you could<br> give me some proof.<br> Maybe then I could believe.<br> Maybe then these monsters<br> of doubt and hate...<br> would stop<br> consuming my very soul.<br> For the love of God, Sister,<br> give me some proof.<br> I wish I could help you...<br> but I have never suffered.<br> I have never...<br> Perhaps I can help you.<br> It may be<br> there is proof for you.<br> - Well, Doctor?<br> - Well, in addition to<br> the large tumor on the knee...<br> she has tuberculosis<br> of the bone.<br> She has never complained<br> of pain?<br> No.<br> - Has she?<br> - She never mentioned it.<br> I can't understand it.<br> She's had this affliction<br> for a long time.<br> And the constant pain<br> and suffering, which is so<br> characteristic of this disease...<br> is too horrible to describe.<br> Oh, God, I have tried to storm<br> the gates ofheaven...<br> by sacrificing myself.<br> I know now that<br> we must be chosen...<br> that we must be graced,<br> as you have graced this child.<br> God, forgive me.<br> I have persecuted her,<br> and I did not believe her...<br> because I was filled<br> with hate and envy.<br> God help me to serve this chosen soul<br> for the rest of my days.<br> God help me.<br> God help me.<br> You seem a trifle<br> stronger today, Sister.<br> Yes, thank you,<br> Mother Superior, I am.<br> Sister Marie-Therese and I have<br> been discussing the possibility<br> of your taking a trip.<br> A trip?<br> We could make the journey to our convent<br> at Lourdes in easy stages.<br> Lourdes?<br> Should not you, of all people,<br> take advantage of the benefit...<br> that's come to<br> the whole world through you?<br> That cannot be done.<br> And why not?<br> The spring is not for me.<br> Why should not the spring work<br> in your case, of all cases, Sister?<br> The spring is not for me.<br> Did the Lady<br> tell you that, my child?<br> She said...<br> "I cannot promise you<br> happiness in this world...<br> only in the next."<br> The spring is not for me.<br> Thank you, Doctor.<br> In that case, Father,<br> we must notify the bishop immediately.<br> He wants to hear from Marie-Bernarde's<br> lips a final confirmation.<br> Sister Marie-Bernarde, we shall read<br> to you the final protocol...<br> of the Commission of Investigation,<br> assembled in 1858.<br> It contains a record...<br> of all the testimony which<br> you offered at the time.<br> We ask nothing of you,<br> except that you confirm that testimony.<br> Do you feel equal to that?<br> Yes.<br> "On February 11,<br> in the year of our Lord, 1858...<br> "I, Bernadette Soubirous, was sent<br> in the company of my sister Marie...<br> "and my friend Jeanne Abadie...<br> to fetch firewood<br> in the forest."<br> Do you confirm this?<br> I did see her.<br> "At a location known<br> as Massabielle, I rested...<br> while my sister and friend<br> crossed the River Gave. "<br> Do you confirm this?<br> I... did see her.<br> "For a time, nothing happened.<br> - "Suddenly I noticed<br> that the rosebush was shaking.<br> - I did see her.<br> "I thought this strange...<br> - because there was no..."<br> - I did see her.<br> I did see her.<br> I...<br> did... see... her.<br> You're not sorry<br> you came back to visit us?<br> No. For five years<br> I've been stationed in Languedoc.<br> A stinking hole,<br> if ever there was one.<br> Now that I see this, I realize<br> what a paradise I've been living in.<br> You see, my friend, how deeply hell<br> reaches into human life.<br> Poor, ignorant sheep.<br> Why do they come?<br> Because they have faith.<br> Because they're desperate.<br> Because occasionally<br> someone is cured.<br> And because some hypochondriac,<br> due to emotional excitement...<br> forgets a malady<br> that never existed.<br> Oh, yes, we have<br> hundreds of those.<br> But we have many, many other cases<br> that aren't so easy to explain.<br> Yesterday there was a woman with<br> lupus... tuberculosis of the face.<br> Suddenly she discovered<br> a nose and a mouth...<br> where only ten minutes before<br> there was nothing but<br> one large, decaying cavity.<br> Please, Doctor...<br> I'm not a gullible sheepherder<br> from the Pyrenees.<br> We have pictures in the office.<br> Would you care to come down?<br> Gentlemen, what's the use?<br> The same argument has been going on<br> for a great many years...<br> and I'm afraid will go on<br> for a great many more.<br> For those who believe in God,<br> no explanation is necessary.<br> For those who do not,<br> no explanation will suffice.<br> - Your Reverence...<br> - Yes, Adolar.<br> Here is a message. Your housekeeper<br> thought it was important.<br> Thank you.<br> This is the first.<br> You remember him,<br> the Bouhouhorts child?<br> - Is that all, Your Reverence?<br> - Yes, thank you, Adolar.<br> You should have the doctor give<br> you something for that cold, monsieur.<br> No. It's just a little<br> laryngitis I picked up...<br> on the drafty train last night.<br> It will be gone by tomorrow.<br> Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> Good day.<br> - Good day, Dean.<br> - Good day, Dean.<br> And I give you<br> full permission, dear Doctor...<br> to write down<br> in your big book...<br> that my amazing recovery<br> was due solely to the Lady of Lourdes.<br> If I kept such a book, I would<br> write you down merely as a skeptic...<br> who I promise will<br> leave Lourdes at least... wondering.<br> Not I, Doctor.<br> Not I.<br> This place only<br> succeeds in revolting me.<br> Once it was a dull but pleasing<br> little village. Now look at it.<br> - A tremendous sponge sopping up<br> all the infection of the world.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Jones.<br> - Morning, Dr. Dozous.<br> - Good day, gentlemen.<br> - Good day, Monsieur Dutour.<br> - Good day, monsieur.<br> - You look better today.<br> - Oh, yes, Doctor. I think<br> I feel much better today.<br> MonsieurJones's voice<br> has a lot in common with...<br> Monsieur Dutour's.<br> - Don't you think?<br> - Yes, now that you mention it.<br> MonsieurJones<br> has cancer of the larynx.<br> #Ave, Ave #<br> #Ave Maria #<br> - Holy Mary.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Mother of God.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Holy Virgin of virgins.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Mother of Christ.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Mother of Divine Grace.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Mother most pure.<br> - I am a stranger here.<br> I'm not like these<br> thousands of souls...<br> flickering brightly<br> and hopefully in the darkness.<br> My pride has always stood<br> between them and me.<br> The pride of being<br> a superior human being.<br> But now I know that<br> we're all a wretched animal species...<br> distinguished from the insects<br> only by nerve centers...<br> thoughts, reasoning.<br> A hungry cancer<br> is feeding at my throat.<br> Tomorrow I'll<br> crawl back to Languedoc...<br> hide in some hole of death<br> and be heard of no more.<br> I'll be alone.<br> Alone and desolate.<br> And why not? It's logical.<br> I'll be alone because I have loved<br> no one... no one and nothing.<br> - Not even myself.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Help of Christians.<br> - Pray for us.<br> Nothing.<br> - Queen of the patriarchs.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Nothing.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Queen of apostles.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Queen of the martyrs.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Queen of all saints.<br> - Pray for me, Bernadette.<br> - Queen conceived without original sin.<br> - Pray for us.<br> - Your Reverence.<br> - My child.<br> - I didn't lie to you.<br> - God knows you didn't.<br> They questioned me...<br> again and again.<br> I saw her.<br> Tell them I saw her.<br> They won't believe me.<br> Yes, my little one,<br> you saw her.<br> And you will see her again.<br> I'm not so sure.<br> Maybe I haven't<br> suffered enough.<br> You've suffered enough,<br> my child, for the heaven of heavens.<br> Oh, no.<br> I know about sick people.<br> We all exaggerate a little.<br> Our pains aren't so terrible.<br> I believe...<br> Sister. Sister.<br> Are the pains worse?<br> What day is this?<br> Wednesday.<br> Wednesday?<br> Tomorrow...<br> Tomorrow<br> will be Thursday.<br> The Lady...<br> Madame...<br> Madame...<br> Madame...<br> The Lady won't come here,<br> Your Reverence.<br> I'll never see her again.<br> You will, my child.<br> No.<br> No, I was stupid and lazy.<br> I didn't even know<br> what the Holy Trinity was.<br> Where are you, Madame?<br> Where are you?<br> She's gone.<br> Behold my beloved speaketh...<br> - Gone.<br> - Arise. Make haste, my love,<br> my dove, my beautiful one.<br> - I won't see her.<br> - For winter is now past.<br> The rain is over and gone.<br> I'll never see her again.<br> The vines in flower yield<br> their sweet smell.<br> - Never.<br> - Arise, my love,<br> my beautiful one, and come.<br> - Never.<br> - My dove in the clefts of the rock...<br> - in the hollow places of the wall.<br> - I'll never see...<br> Show me thy face.<br> Let thy voice sound in my ears.<br> For thy voice is sweet<br> and thy face comely.<br> My beloved to me, and I<br> to him who feedeth among the lilies...<br> till the day breaks<br> and the shadows retire.<br> - Arise. Make haste...<br> - I love you.<br> I love you.<br> Hail Mary, full of grace,<br> the Lord is with thee.<br> Holy Mary, Mother of God,<br> pray for me.<br> Pray for us sinners now...<br> and at the hour<br> of our death. Amen.<br> You are now<br> in heaven and on earth.<br> Your life begins,<br> oh Bernadette.<br>
