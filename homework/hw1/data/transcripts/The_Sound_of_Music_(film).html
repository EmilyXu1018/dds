                        The hills are alive<br> With the sound of music<br> With songs they have sung<br> For a thousand years<br> The hills fill my heart<br> With the sound of music<br> My heart wants to sing<br> Every song it hears<br> My heart wants to beat like the wings<br> Of the birds that rise<br> From the lake to the trees<br> My heart wants to sigh<br> Like a chime that flies<br> From a church on a breeze<br> To laugh like a brook<br> When it trips and falls<br> Over stones on its way<br> To sing through the night<br> Like a lark who is learning to pray<br> I go to the hills<br> When my heart is lonely<br> I know I will hear<br> What I've heard before<br> My heart will be blessed<br> With the sound of music<br> And I'll sing...<br> ...once more<br> Hallelujah, hallelujah<br> Hallelujah, hallelujah<br> - Reverend Mother.<br> - Sister Bernice.<br> - I simply cannot find her.<br> - Maria?<br> She's missing again.<br> We should've put a cowbell<br> around her neck.<br> Have you tried the barn? You know<br> how much she adores the animals.<br> I have looked everywhere.<br> In all of the usual places.<br> Sister, considering it's Maria...<br> ...I suggest you look in someplace<br> unusual.<br> Well, Reverend Mother...<br> ...I hope this new infraction ends<br> whatever doubts...<br> ...you may still have<br> about Maria's future here.<br> I always try to keep faith<br> in my doubts, Sister Berthe.<br> After all, the wool of a black sheep<br> is just as warm.<br> We are not talking about sheep,<br> black or white, Sister Margaretta.<br> Of all the candidates for<br> the novitiate, Maria is the least...<br> Children, children.<br> We were speculating about<br> the qualifications of our postulants.<br> The Mistress of Novices<br> and the Mistress of Postulants...<br> ...were trying to help me<br> by expressing opposite points of view.<br> Tell me, Sister Catherine,<br> what do you think of Maria?<br> She's a wonderful girl,<br> some of the time.<br> - Sister Agatha?<br> - It's very easy to like Maria...<br> ...except when it's difficult.<br> - And you, Sister Sophia?<br> - Oh, I love her very dearly.<br> But she always seems to be<br> in trouble, doesn't she?<br> Exactly what I say.<br> She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee<br> Her dress has got a tear<br> She waltzes on her way to Mass<br> And whistles on the stair<br> And underneath her wimple<br> She has curlers in her hair<br> I've even heard her singing<br> In the abbey<br> She's always late for chapel<br> But her penitence is real<br> She's always late for everything<br> Except for every meal<br> I hate to have to say it<br> But I very firmly feel<br> Maria's not an asset to the abbey<br> I'd like to say a word in her behalf<br> Say it, Sister Margaretta.<br> Maria makes me laugh<br> How do you solve a problem like Maria?<br> How do you catch a cloud<br> And pin it down?<br> How do you find a word<br> That means Maria?<br> A flibbertigibbet<br> - A will-o'-the-wisp<br> - A clown<br> Many a thing you know<br> You'd like to tell her<br> Many a thing she ought to understand<br> But how do you make her stay<br> And listen to all you say?<br> How do you keep a wave upon the sand?<br> How do you solve a problem like Maria?<br> How do you hold a moonbeam...<br> ...in your hand?<br> When I'm with her I'm confused<br> Out of focus and bemused<br> And I never know exactly where I am<br> - Unpredictable as weather<br> - She's as flighty as a feather<br> - She's a darling<br> - She's a demon<br> She's a lamb<br> She'll out pester any pest<br> Drive a hornet from its nest<br> She can throw a whirling dervish<br> Out of whirl<br> - She is gentle, she is wild<br> - She's a riddle, she's a child<br> - She's a headache<br> - She's an angel<br> She's a girl<br> How do you solve a problem like Maria?<br> How do you catch a cloud<br> And pin it down?<br> How do you find a word<br> That means Maria?<br> - A flibbertigibbet<br> - A will-o'-the-wisp<br> A clown<br> Many a thing you know<br> You'd like to tell her<br> Many a thing she ought to understand<br> - But how do you make her stay<br> - And listen to all you say?<br> How do you keep a wave upon the sand?<br> How do you solve a problem like Maria?<br> How do you hold a moonbeam...<br> ...in your hand?<br> You may go in now, Maria.<br> Come here, my child.<br> Now sit down.<br> Reverend Mother, I'm sorry.<br> I couldn't help myself.<br> - The hills were beckoning and before...<br> - Dear.<br> I haven't summoned you for apologies.<br> Please let me ask for forgiveness.<br> If you'll feel better.<br> Yes, you see,<br> the sky was so blue today...<br> ...and everything was so green and<br> fragrant, I had to be a part of it.<br> The Untersberg led me higher like<br> it wanted me to go through the clouds.<br> Suppose darkness had come<br> and you were lost?<br> Mother, I could never be lost<br> up there.<br> That's my mountain.<br> I was brought up on it.<br> It was the mountain that led me<br> to you.<br> When I was a child,<br> I would come down and climb a tree...<br> ...and look in your garden.<br> I'd see the sisters at work<br> and hear them sing.<br> Which brings me to another<br> transgression, Reverend Mother.<br> I was singing out there today.<br> Only in the abbey do we have rules<br> about postulants singing.<br> I can't stop wherever I am.<br> Worse, I can't seem to stop<br> saying things.<br> Everything I think and feel.<br> Some call that "honesty."<br> Oh, but it's terrible,<br> Reverend Mother!<br> You know how Sister Berthe makes me<br> kiss the floor after a disagreement?<br> Lately, I kiss the floor<br> when I see her coming to save time.<br> Maria...<br> ...when you saw us over the wall<br> and longed to be with us...<br> ...that didn't mean you were prepared<br> for the way we live here, did it?<br> No, Mother, but I pray and I try.<br> And I am learning. I really am.<br> What is the most important lesson<br> you have learned here?<br> To find out what is the will of God<br> and do it wholeheartedly.<br> Maria...<br> ...it seems to be God's will<br> that you leave us.<br> - Leave?<br> - Only for a while.<br> No, Mother!<br> Please don't send me away!<br> This is where I belong. It's my home,<br> my family. It's my life.<br> - Are you truly ready for it?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> If you go out into the world for a<br> time, knowing what we expect of you...<br> ...you will find out<br> if you can expect it of yourself.<br> I know what you expect, Mother,<br> and I can do it! I promise I can!<br> Yes, Mother.<br> If it is God's will.<br> There is a family near Salzburg that<br> needs a governess until September.<br> - September?<br> - For seven children.<br> Seven children?!<br> Do you like children?<br> Well, yes, but seven!<br> I will tell Captain von Trapp<br> to expect you tomorrow.<br> Captain?<br> A retired officer of the Imperial<br> Navy. A fine man and a brave one.<br> His wife died,<br> and he is alone with the children.<br> I understand he has had a difficult<br> time keeping a governess there.<br> Why difficult, Reverend Mother?<br> The Lord will show you<br> in His own good time.<br> When the Lord closes a door...<br> ...somewhere He opens a window.<br> What will this day be like?<br> I wonder<br> What will my future be?<br> I wonder<br> It could be so exciting<br> To be out in the world<br> To be free<br> My heart should be wildly rejoicing<br> Oh, what's the matter with me?<br> I've always longed for adventure<br> To do the things I've never dared<br> Now here I'm facing adventure<br> Then why am I so scared?<br> A captain with seven children<br> What's so fearsome about that?<br> I must stop these doubts and worries<br> If I don't I just know I'll turn back<br> I must dream of the things<br> I am seeking<br> I am seeking the courage I lack<br> The courage to serve them<br> With reliance<br> Face my mistakes without defiance<br> Show them I'm worthy<br> And while I show them<br> I'll show me<br> So let them bring on<br> All their problems<br> I'll do better than my best<br> I have confidence<br> They'll put me to the test<br> But I'll make them see<br> I have confidence in me<br> Somehow I will impress them<br> I will be firm but kind<br> And all those children<br> Heaven bless them<br> They will look up to me<br> And mind me<br> With each step I am more certain<br> Everything will turn out fine<br> I have confidence<br> The world can all be mine<br> They'll have to agree<br> I have confidence in me<br> I have confidence in sunshine<br> I have confidence in rain<br> I have confidence<br> That spring will come again<br> Besides which you see<br> I have confidence in me<br> Strength doesn't lie in numbers<br> Strength doesn't lie in wealth<br> Strength lies in nights<br> Of peaceful slumbers<br> When you wake up, wake up<br> It's healthy<br> All I trust I leave my heart to<br> All I trust becomes my own<br> I have confidence in confidence alone<br> Oh, help.<br> I have confidence in confidence alone<br> Besides which you see<br> I have confidence...<br> ...in me<br> Hello. Here I am.<br> I'm from the convent.<br> I'm the new governess, captain.<br> And I'm the old butler, frulein.<br> Well, how do you do?<br> You'll wait here, please.<br> In future, remember certain rooms<br> in this house are not to be disturbed.<br> Yes, captain, sir.<br> - Why do you stare at me that way?<br> - You don't look like a sea captain.<br> I'm afraid you don't look<br> very much like a governess.<br> - Turn around.<br> - What?<br> Turn.<br> Hat off.<br> Put on another dress<br> before meeting the children.<br> But I don't have another.<br> When we enter the abbey,<br> our worldly clothes go to the poor.<br> What about this one?<br> The poor didn't want it.<br> There wasn't time to make a new dress.<br> I can make clothes.<br> I'll see that you get some material.<br> Today, if possible.<br> - Now, frulein...<br> - Maria.<br> I don't know how much<br> the abbess told you.<br> You are the twelfth governess...<br> ...to look after my children<br> since their mother died.<br> I trust you will be an improvement<br> on the last one.<br> She stayed only two hours.<br> What's wrong with the children, sir?<br> Nothing is wrong with the children,<br> only the governesses.<br> They could not maintain discipline,<br> without which the house cannot be run.<br> Drill them in their studies.<br> I will not permit them to dream<br> away their summer holidays.<br> Each afternoon,<br> they march, breathing deeply.<br> Bedtime is to be strictly observed.<br> When do they play?<br> You will see to it that they conduct<br> themselves with the utmost decorum.<br> - I am placing you in command.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Now...<br> ...this is your new governess,<br> Frulein Maria.<br> Give your name at your signal.<br> Frulein, listen carefully. Learn<br> their signals so you can call them.<br> Liesl.<br> Friedrich.<br> Louisa.<br> Kurt.<br> Brigitta.<br> Marta.<br> Gretl.<br> Now, let's see how well you listened.<br> I won't need to whistle for them,<br> Reverend Captain.<br> I mean, I'll use their names.<br> Such lovely names.<br> Frulein, this is a large house.<br> The grounds are extensive.<br> And I will not have anyone shouting.<br> You will take this, please.<br> Learn to use it.<br> The children will help you.<br> Now, when I want you,<br> this is what you will hear.<br> Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!<br> I could never answer to a whistle.<br> Whistles are for animals,<br> not for children.<br> And definitely not for me.<br> It would be too humiliating.<br> Frulein, were you this much trouble<br> at the abbey?<br> Oh, much more, sir.<br> I don't know your signal.<br> You may call me "captain."<br> At ease.<br> Now that there's just us...<br> ...would you please tell me all your<br> names again and how old you are.<br> I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old,<br> and I don't need a governess.<br> I'm glad you told me, Liesl.<br> We'll just be good friends.<br> I'm Friedrich. I'm 14.<br> I'm impossible.<br> Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?<br> Frulein Josephine.<br> Four governesses ago.<br> I'm Brigitta.<br> You didn't tell me how old you are,<br> Louisa.<br> I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.<br> She's 13 years old, and you're smart.<br> I'm 10, and I think your dress<br> is the ugliest one I ever saw.<br> - Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.<br> - Why not?<br> - Don't you think it's ugly?<br> - Of course.<br> But Frulein Helga's was ugliest.<br> I'm Kurt. I'm 11.<br> I'm incorrigible.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - What's "incorrigible"?<br> I think it means you want<br> to be treated like a boy.<br> I'm Marta, and I'm going to be<br> seven on Tuesday.<br> I'd like a pink parasol.<br> Pink's my favorite color too.<br> Yes, you're Gretl.<br> And you're five years old?<br> My, you're practically a lady.<br> I have to tell you a secret.<br> I've never been a governess.<br> You don't know anything<br> about being a governess?<br> Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.<br> The best way to start is to tell<br> Father to mind his own business.<br> Never come to dinner on time.<br> Never eat your soup quietly.<br> During dessert, always blow your nose.<br> Don't you believe a word they say,<br> Frulein Maria.<br> - Oh, why not?<br> - Because I like you.<br> Children, outside for your walk.<br> Father's orders. Hurry up.<br> Quick, quick, quick.<br> Frulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt,<br> the housekeeper.<br> How do you do.<br> I'll show you to your room.<br> Follow me.<br> Poor little dears.<br> You're very lucky. With<br> Frulein Helga it was a snake.<br> Good evening.<br> - Good evening, children.<br> - Good evening, Frulein Maria.<br> Enchanting little ritual.<br> Something you learned at the abbey?<br> No.<br> Rheumatism.<br> Excuse me, captain. Haven't we<br> forgotten to thank the Lord?<br> For what we receive,<br> may the Lord make us truly thankful.<br> - Amen.<br> - Amen.<br> I'd like to thank you all...<br> ...for the precious gift<br> you left in my pocket today.<br> What gift?<br> It's a secret between<br> the children and me.<br> Then I suggest you keep it,<br> and let us eat.<br> Knowing how nervous<br> I must have been...<br> ...a stranger in a new household...<br> ...knowing how important it was<br> for me to feel accepted...<br> ...it was so kind and thoughtful of<br> you to make my first moments here...<br> ...so warm and happy...<br> ...and pleasant.<br> - What is the matter, Marta?<br> - Nothing.<br> Frulein...<br> ...is it to be at every meal<br> or merely at dinnertime...<br> ...that you intend leading us through<br> this rare and wonderful new world...<br> ...of indigestion?<br> They're all right, captain.<br> They're just happy.<br> - Rolfe, good evening.<br> - Good evening, Franz.<br> - I trust everything is under control?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - Are there any developments?<br> - Perhaps.<br> - Is the captain home?<br> - He's at dinner.<br> - With the family?<br> - Yes.<br> Give him this telegram at once.<br> Certainly.<br> A telegram for you, sir.<br> Franz? Who delivered it?<br> That young lad Rolfe, of course.<br> Father, may I be excused?<br> Children, in the morning I shall<br> be going to Vienna.<br> Not again, Father!<br> How long will you be gone this time?<br> I'm not sure, Gretl.<br> - To visit Baroness Schraeder again?<br> - Mind your own business!<br> As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.<br> - Why can't we ever see the baroness?<br> - Why would she want to see you?<br> You are going to see the baroness.<br> I'm bringing her back with me to visit.<br> And Uncle Max.<br> Uncle Max!<br> Rolfe!<br> Oh, Rolfe!<br> - No, Liesl. We mustn't!<br> - Why not, silly?<br> - I don't know...<br> - Isn't this why you're waiting?<br> Yes, of course.<br> - I've missed you, Liesl.<br> - You have? How much?<br> I even thought of sending a telegram,<br> so I'd be able to deliver it here.<br> Oh, that's a lovely thought!<br> Why don't you, right now?<br> - But I'm here!<br> - Please, Rolfe. Send me a telegram.<br> I'll start it for you.<br> "Dear Liesl..."<br> "Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able<br> to tell you...<br> ...how I feel about you.

He's a big naval hero.<br> He was even decorated by the emperor.<br> I don't worry about him.<br> I worry about his daughter.<br> Me? Why?<br> - Well, you're so...<br> - What?<br> You're such a baby!<br> I'm 16.<br> What's such a baby about that?<br> You wait, little girl<br> On an empty stage<br> For fate to turn the light on<br> Your life, little girl<br> Is an empty page<br> That men will want to write on<br> To write on<br> You are 16 going on 17<br> Baby, it's time to think<br> Better beware<br> Be canny and careful<br> Baby, you're on the brink<br> You are 16 going on 17<br> Fellows will fall in line<br> Eager young lads<br> And rous and cads<br> Will offer you food and wine<br> Totally unprepared are you<br> To face a world of men<br> Timid and shy and scared are you<br> Of things beyond your ken<br> You need someone older and wiser<br> Telling you what to do<br> I am 17 going on 18<br> I'll take care of you<br> I am 16 going on 17<br> I know that I'm naive<br> Fellows I meet<br> May tell me I'm sweet<br> And willingly I believe<br> I am 16 going on 17<br> Innocent as a rose<br> Bachelor dandies<br> Drinkers of brandies<br> What do I know of those?<br> Totally unprepared am I<br> To face a world of men<br> Timid and shy and scared am I<br> Of things beyond my ken<br> I need someone older and wiser<br> Telling me what to do<br> You are 17 going on 18<br> I'll depend on you<br> Come in.<br> Frau Schmidt.<br> For your new dresses.<br> - The captain had these sent from town.<br> - Oh, how lovely!<br> These will make the prettiest<br> clothes I've ever had.<br> Do you think he would<br> get me more material if I asked?<br> - How many dresses do you need?<br> - Not for me, for the children.<br> I want to make them some play clothes.<br> The von Trapp children don't play.<br> They march.<br> Surely you don't approve of that.<br> Ever since the captain<br> lost his poor wife...<br> ...he runs this house as if on<br> one of his ships.<br> Whistles, orders.<br> No more music, no more laughing.<br> Nothing that reminds him of her.<br> Even the children.<br> But that's so wrong.<br> Oh, well.<br> How do you like your room?<br> There'll be new drapes at the windows.<br> Bu these are fine.<br> New ones have been ordered.<br> - But I really don't need them.<br> - Good night, now.<br> Frau Schmidt, if I asked<br> the captain about the material...?<br> - He's leaving in the morning.<br> - Of course. How long will he be gone?<br> It depends. The last time he visited<br> the baroness, he stayed for a month.<br> I shouldn't be saying this to you.<br> I don't know you that well.<br> But if you ask me,<br> the captain's thinking seriously...<br> ...of marrying her before<br> summer's over.<br> Wonderful! The children will<br> have a mother again.<br> Yes.<br> Well, good night.<br> Good night.<br> Dear Father, now I know<br> why You sent me here.<br> To help these children<br> prepare for a new mother.<br> And I pray this will become<br> a happy family in Thy sight.<br> God bless the captain.<br> God bless Liesl and Friedrich.<br> God bless Louisa, Brigitta,<br> Marta and little Gretl.<br> And I forgot the other boy.<br> What's his name?<br> Well, God bless what's-his-name.<br> God bless the Reverend Mother<br> and Sister Margaretta...<br> ...and everybody at the abbey.<br> And now, dear God, about Liesl.<br> Help her know that I'm her friend...<br> ...and help her tell me<br> what she's been up to.<br> Are you going to tell on me?<br> Help me to be understanding<br> so I may guide her footsteps.<br> In the name of the Father,<br> the Son and the Holy Ghost.<br> I was out walking<br> and somebody locked the doors early.<br> I didn't want to wake everybody,<br> so when I saw your window open...<br> You're not going to tell Father,<br> are you?<br> How did you climb up?<br> It's how we always got in<br> to play tricks on the governess.<br> Louisa can make it with<br> a whole jar of spiders in her hand.<br> Spiders?<br> Were you out walking all by yourself?<br> If we wash that dress tonight,<br> nobody would notice it tomorrow.<br> You could put this on.<br> Take your dress and put it<br> to soak in the bathtub.<br> Come back here and sit on the bed,<br> and we'll have a talk.<br> I told you today<br> I didn't need a governess.<br> Well, maybe I do.<br> Gretl, are you scared?<br> You're not frightened<br> of a storm, are you?<br> You just stay right here with me.<br> - Where are the others?<br> - They're asleep. They're not scared.<br> Oh, no? Look.<br> All right, up here on the bed.<br> - Really?<br> - Well, just this once. Come on.<br> - Now we'll wait for the boys.<br> - You won't see them. Boys are brave.<br> You weren't scared, were you?<br> Oh, no. We just wanted<br> to be sure that you weren't.<br> - That's very thoughtful of you.<br> - It wasn't my idea.<br> It was Kurt's!<br> Kurt! That's the one I left out!<br> God bless Kurt.<br> Why does it do that?<br> The lightning talks to the thunder,<br> and the thunder answers.<br> - But lightning must be nasty.<br> - Not really.<br> Why does the thunder get so angry?<br> It makes me want to cry.<br> Whenever I'm feeling unhappy,<br> I just try to think of nice things.<br> What kind of things?<br> Well, let me see.

As a matter of fact...<br> Yes?<br> Well, I was...<br> What she would like to say...<br> ...is that she and I have<br> been getting acquainted tonight.<br> It's too late to go into that. You<br> heard your father. Go back to bed.<br> Frulein...<br> ...you have managed to remember<br> I'm leaving in the morning?<br> Is it also possible you remember the<br> first rule in this house is discipline?<br> Then I trust that before I return...<br> ...you'll have acquired some?<br> Captain?<br> Could I talk to you about clothes<br> for the children for when they play?<br> - If I could have some material.<br> - You are many things.<br> Not the least of which is repetitious.<br> - But they're children!<br> - Yes.<br> And I'm their father.<br> Good night.<br> Girls in white dresses<br> With blue satin sashes<br> When the dog bites<br> When the bee stings<br> When I'm feeling sad<br> I simply remember my favorite things<br> And then I don't feel...<br> ...so bad<br> Children, over here. See!<br> Come on.<br> Frulein Maria?<br> Can we do this every day?<br> - Don't you think you'd get tired of it?<br> - I suppose so.<br> Every other day?<br> I haven't had so much fun since we put<br> glue on Frulein Josephine's toothbrush.<br> I can't understand how children<br> as nice as you can play such tricks.<br> - It's easy.<br> - But why do it?<br> How else can we get<br> Father's attention?<br> Oh, I see.<br> We'll have to think about that one.<br> All right, over here.<br> What are we going to do?<br> Think of a song for the baroness.<br> Father doesn't like us to sing.<br> Perhaps we can change his mind.<br> Now, what songs do you know?<br> We don't know any songs.<br> - Not any?<br> - We don't even know how to sing.<br> Let's not lose time. You must learn.<br> But how?<br> Let's start at the very beginning<br> A very good place to start<br> When you read you begin with<br> A, B, C<br> When you sing, you begin with<br> Do-Re-Mi<br> Do-re-mi<br> Do-re-mi<br> The first three notes<br> Just happen to be<br> Do-re-mi<br> Do-re-mi<br> Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti<br> Let's see if I can make it easier.<br> "Doe," a deer<br> A female deer<br> "Ray," a drop of golden sun<br> "Me," a name I call myself<br> "Far," a long long way to run<br> "Sew," a needle pulling thread<br> "La," a note to follow sew<br> "Tea," a drink with jam and bread<br> That will bring us back to doe<br> - Doe<br> - A deer, a female deer<br> - Ray<br> - A drop of golden sun<br> - Me<br> - A name I call myself<br> - Far<br> - A long long way to run<br> Sew, a needle pulling thread<br> - La<br> - A note to follow sew<br> - - A drink with jam and bread<br> That will bring us back to<br> - Doe<br> - A deer, a female deer<br> Ray, a drop of golden sun<br> Me, a name I call myself<br> Far, a long long way to run<br> Sew, a needle pulling thread<br> La, a note to follow sew<br> Tea, a drink with jam and bread<br> That will bring us back to doe<br> Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do<br> Do-re-mi-fa-so and so on are only<br> the tools we use to build a song.<br> Once you have them in your head<br> you can sing different tunes...<br> ...by mixing them up. Like this:<br> So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re<br> Can you do that?<br> So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re<br> So-do-la-ti-do-re-do<br> So-do-la-ti-do-re-do<br> Now, put it all together.<br> So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re<br> So-do-la-ti-do-re-do<br> - Good.<br> - But it doesn't mean anything.<br> So we put in words.<br> One word for every note.<br> Like this:<br> When you know the notes to sing<br> You can sing most anything<br> Together!<br> When you know the notes to sing<br> You can sing most anything<br> - Doe<br> - A deer, a female deer<br> - Ray<br> - A drop of golden sun<br> - Me<br> - A name I call myself<br> - Far<br> - A long long way to run<br> - Sew<br> - A needle pulling thread<br> - La<br> - A note to follow sew<br> - - A drink with jam and bread<br> That will bring us back to doe<br> When you know the notes to sing<br> You can sing most anything<br> Doe<br> A deer, a female deer<br> Ray<br> A drop of golden sun<br> Me<br> A name I call myself<br> Far<br> A long long way to run<br> Sew<br> A needle pulling thread<br> La<br> A note to follow sew<br> A drink with jam and bread<br> That will bring us back to<br> So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re<br> So-do-la-fa-ti<br> La-so<br> Ti-do<br> So-do<br> The mountains are magnificent,<br> really magnificent.<br> - I had them put up just for you.<br> - Oh?<br> Even if it's to a height<br> of 10,000 feet...<br> ...Georg always believes in<br> "rising to the occasion."<br> Improve the jokes<br> or I'll disinvite you.<br> You didn't invite me.<br> I invited myself.<br> - Naturally.<br> - You needed a chaperone...<br> ...and I needed a place<br> where the cuisine is superb...<br> ...the wine cellar unexcelled...<br> ...and the price perfect.<br> Max, you are outrageous.<br> Not at all.<br> I'm a very charming sponge.<br> Listen.<br> That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.<br> They're good.<br> Very good.<br> I must explore this area<br> in the next few days.<br> Somewhere, a hungry singing group<br> is waiting for Max Detweiler...<br> ...to pluck it out and make it famous<br> at the Salzburg Folk Festival.<br> - They get fame, you get money.<br> - It's unfair, I admit it.<br> But someday that'll be changed.<br> I shall get the fame too.<br> Good heavens, what's this?<br> It's nothing.<br> Just some local urchins.<br> This really is exciting for me, Georg.<br> Being here with you.<br> Trees, lakes,<br> you've seen them before.<br> That is not what I mean,<br> and you know it.<br> - You mean me? I'm exciting?<br> - Is that so impossible?<br> No, just highly improbable.<br> - There you go, running yourself down.<br> - Well, I'm a dangerous driver.<br> You're much less of a riddle<br> when I see you here, Georg.<br> - In my natural habitat?<br> - Yes, exactly.<br> Are you saying that I'm more<br> at home...<br> ...among the birds and the flowers<br> and the wind that moves...<br> ...through the trees<br> like a restless sea?<br> How poetic.<br> Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?<br> More at home here than in Vienna<br> in all your glittering salons...<br> ...gossiping gaily with bores I<br> detest, soaking myself in champagne...<br> ...stumbling about to waltzes<br> by Strausses I can't even remember?<br> - Is that what you're saying?<br> - Yes.<br> Now whatever gave you that idea?<br> Oh, I do like it here, Georg.<br> It's so lovely and peaceful.<br> How can you leave it so often?<br> Oh, pretending to be madly active,<br> I suppose.<br> Activity suggests a life<br> filled with purpose.<br> Could it be running away<br> from memories?<br> Or perhaps just searching<br> for a reason to stay.<br> I hope that's why you've been<br> coming to Vienna so often.<br> - Were there other distractions?<br> - I'd hardly call you a distraction.<br> Well, what would you call me, Georg?<br> Lovely...<br> ...charming, witty, graceful,<br> the perfect hostess...<br> ...and, you're going to hate me<br> for this...<br> ...in a way, my savior.<br> Oh, how unromantic.<br> I'd be an ungrateful wretch<br> if I didn't say...<br> ...that you brought some meaning back<br> into my life.<br> I am amusing, I suppose.<br> I have the finest couturier in Vienna<br> and a glittering circle of friends.<br> - I do give some rather gay parties.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> But take all that away...<br> ...and you have just wealthy,<br> unattached little me...<br> ...searching, just like you.<br> More strudel, Herr Detweiler?<br> - How many have I had?<br> - Two.<br> Make it an uneven three.<br> Still eating, Max?<br> Must be unhappy.<br> That mixed quartet I've been trying<br> to steal away from Sol Hurok...<br> - What happened?<br> ...Sascha Petrie stole them first.<br> I hate thieves.<br> Max, you really must try<br> and learn to love yourself.<br> I had to call Paris, Rome<br> and Stockholm.<br> - On Georg's telephone, of course.<br> - How else could I afford it?<br> I like rich people, the way they live<br> and how I live when I'm with them.<br> I wonder where the children are.<br> They must have heard<br> I was coming and hid.<br> I was hoping they'd be here<br> to welcome you.<br> Max, do step out of character for<br> a moment and try and be charming.<br> Well?<br> Well what?<br> Have you made up his mind?<br> Do I hear wedding bells?<br> - Pealing madly.<br> - Marvelous.<br> - Not necessarily for me.<br> - What kind of talk's that?<br> None-of-your-business talk.<br> I'm terribly fond of him,<br> so don't toy with us.<br> But I'm a child. I like toys.<br> So tell me everything.<br> Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy,<br> intimate, disgusting detail.<br> Well, let's just say I have a feeling<br> I may be here on approval.<br> - I approve of that. How can you miss?<br> - Far too easily.<br> If I know you, darling,<br> and I do, you will find a way.<br> - He's no ordinary man.<br> - No, he's rich.<br> His wife's death gave him<br> a great heartache.<br> And your husband's death<br> gave you a great fortune.<br> Oh, Max, you really are a beast.<br> You and Georg are like family.<br> That's why I want to see you married.<br> We must keep all that lovely money<br> in the family.<br> - What are you doing there?<br> - Oh, Captain von Trapp.<br> I was just looking for...<br> I didn't see, I mean,<br> I didn't know you were...<br> Heil Hitler!<br> Who are you?<br> I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.<br> - I am Herr Detweiler.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You've delivered your telegram.<br> Now get out.<br> - Georg, he's just a boy.<br> - Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.<br> Things will happen.<br> Make sure they don't happen to you.<br> Max! Don't you ever say that again.<br> I have no political convictions.<br> - Can I help it if other people do?<br> - You can help it.<br> You must help it.<br> Hello?<br> You're far away. Where are you?<br> In a world that's disappearing,<br> I'm afraid.<br> Is there any way I could bring you<br> back to the world I'm in?<br> - Father! Father!<br> - There's your father!<br> Oh, captain, you're home!<br> Come out of that water at once!<br> Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.<br> I'm soaked to the skin!<br> Straight line!<br> This is Baroness Schraeder.<br> And these...<br> ...are my children.<br> How do you do?<br> Go inside, dry off, clean up, change<br> your clothes and report back here!<br> Frulein, you will stay here, please!<br> I think I'd better go see<br> what Max is up to.<br> Now, frulein...<br> ...I want a truthful answer.<br> Yes, captain.<br> Is it possible,<br> or could I have just imagined it?<br> Have my children, by any chance,<br> been climbing trees today?<br> Yes, captain.<br> I see.<br> And where, may I ask,<br> did they get these...<br> - Play clothes.<br> - Is that what they are?<br> I made them from the drapes<br> that used to hang in my bedroom.<br> - Drapes?<br> - They have plenty of wear left.<br> We've been everywhere in them.<br> Are you telling me that my children<br> have been roaming about Salzburg...<br> ...dressed up in nothing<br> but some old drapes?<br> And having a marvelous time!<br> - They have uniforms.<br> - Forgive me, straitjackets.<br> They can't be children<br> if they worry about clothes...<br> They don't complain.<br> They don't dare.<br> They love you too much and fear...<br> Don't discuss my children.<br> You've got to hear, you're<br> never home...<br> I don't want to hear more!<br> I know you don't, but you've got to!<br> - Liesl's not a child.<br> - Not one word...<br> Soon she'll be a woman<br> and you won't even know her.<br> Friedrich wants to be a man<br> but you're not here to show...<br> Don't you dare tell me...<br> Brigitta could tell you about him.<br> She notices everything.<br> Kurt acts tough to hide the pain<br> when you ignore him...<br> ...the way you do all of them.<br> Louisa, I don't know about yet.<br> The little ones just want love.<br> Please, love them all.<br> I don't care to hear more.<br> - I am not finished yet, captain!<br> - Oh, yes, you are, captain!<br> Frulein.<br> Now, you will pack<br> your things this minute...<br> ...and return to the abbey.<br> What's that?<br> It's singing.<br> Yes, I realize it's singing.<br> But who is singing?<br> The children.<br> The children?<br> I taught them something to sing<br> for the baroness.<br> My heart wants to sing<br> Every song it hears<br> Every song that it hears<br> My heart wants to beat like the wings<br> Of the birds that rise<br> From the lake to the trees<br> To the trees<br> My heart wants to sigh<br> Like a chime that flies<br> From a church on a breeze<br> To laugh like a brook<br> When it trips and falls<br> Over stones on its way<br> On its way<br> To sing through the night<br> Like a lark who is learning to pray<br> I go to the hills<br> When my heart is lonely<br> I know I will hear<br> What I've heard before<br> My heart will be blessed<br> With the sound of music<br> And I'll sing...<br> ...once more<br> Edelweiss!<br> You never told me how enchanting<br> your children are.<br> Don't go away.<br> Frulein.<br> I...<br> ...behaved badly.

Good evening.<br> Did you notice the obvious<br> display of the Austrian flag?<br> The women look so beautiful.<br> I think they look ugly.<br> You're just scared of them.<br> Silly, only grown-up men fear women.<br> - I think the men look beautiful.<br> - How would you know?<br> Liesl, who are you dancing with?<br> Nobody.<br> Oh, yes, you are.<br> May I have this dance?<br> I'd be delighted, young man.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> you could dance?<br> We feared you'd make us all dance.<br> The von Trapp Family Dancers.<br> What are they playing?<br> It's the Laendler.<br> An Austrian folk dance.<br> - Show me.<br> - I haven't danced since I was little.<br> You remember.

She must join the party.<br> - No, really l...<br> - Stop. Stop it now.<br> - Georg, please.<br> - You can if you want to, frulein.<br> I insist.<br> You will be my dinner partner.<br> This is business.<br> Franz...<br> ...set another place next to mine<br> for Frulein Maria.<br> - Whatever you say.<br> - It appears to be all arranged.<br> - It does.<br> - I'm not suitably dressed.<br> You can change. We'll wait.<br> Captain, you must be very proud<br> of your youngsters.<br> I am, thank you.<br> Is there a more beautiful expression<br> of what is good in our country...<br> ...than the innocent voices<br> of our children?<br> Oh, come now, baron.<br> Would you have us believe that Austria<br> holds a monopoly on virtue?<br> Herr Zeller, some of us prefer<br> Austrian voices raised in song...<br> ...to ugly German threats.<br> The ostrich buries his head<br> in the sand...<br> ...and sometimes in the flag.<br> Perhaps those who would warn you that<br> the Anschluss is coming, and it is...<br> ...would get further with you by setting<br> their words to music.<br> If the Nazis take over Austria, you<br> will be the entire trumpet section.<br> You flatter me.<br> Oh, how clumsy of me.<br> I meant to accuse you.<br> It's very kind of you<br> to offer to help me, baroness.<br> I'm delighted, Maria.<br> I really don't think I have anything<br> that would be appropriate.<br> Now where is that lovely little thing<br> you were wearing the other evening?<br> When the captain couldn't keep<br> his eyes off you.<br> Couldn't keep his eyes off me?<br> Come, my dear, we are women.<br> Let's not pretend we don't know<br> when a man notices us.<br> - Here we are.<br> - The captain notices everybody.<br> There's no need to feel<br> so defensive, Maria.<br> You are quite attractive, you know.<br> The captain would hardly be a man<br> if he didn't notice you.<br> Baroness, I hope you're joking.<br> Not at all.<br> I've never done a thing to...<br> You don't have to, my dear.<br> Nothing's more irresistible to a man<br> than a woman who's in love with him.<br> - In love with him?<br> - Of course.<br> What makes it so nice is<br> he thinks he's in love with you.<br> But that's not true.<br> Surely you've noticed the way<br> he looks into your eyes.<br> And you know, you blushed in his arms<br> when you were dancing just now.<br> Don't take it to heart.<br> He'll get over it soon enough,<br> I think.<br> Men do, you know.<br> Then I should go.<br> I mustn't stay here.<br> - Is there something I can do to help?<br> - No, nothing.<br> Yes.<br> Don't say a word to the captain.<br> No, I wouldn't dream of it.<br> Goodbye, Maria.<br> I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.<br> Champagne, darling.<br> I feel like celebrating. Cheers.<br> - You know something.<br> - Perhaps.<br> If you're so clever, tell me how to<br> get frulein to influence Georg.<br> I want those children in the festival.<br> Elsa, this is important to Austria.<br> Wouldn't do you any harm either.<br> I thought of that.<br> Well, if it's a matter of influence...<br> ...maybe the one you have<br> to be talking to is me.<br> - Two.<br> - Three.<br> - Four.<br> - Five.<br> - Six.<br> - Seven.<br> Eight.<br> - Four.<br> - Two.<br> - Seven.<br> - Five.<br> - Two.<br> - Six.<br> Isn't this fun?<br> - Four.<br> - I'm number five.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Eight.<br> - Two.<br> - Four.<br> Six.<br> Two.<br> Baroness Schraeder, do you mind<br> if we stop now? We're tired.<br> Whatever you want, dear.<br> We'll do it again tomorrow.<br> The country's so restful, isn't it?<br> Have some lemonade.<br> There must be an easier way.<br> I get a fiendish delight thinking<br> of you as the mother of seven.<br> How do you plan to do it?<br> Darling, haven't you ever heard...<br> ...of a delightful little thing<br> called boarding school?<br> Baroness Machiavelli.<br> Uncle Max, where's Father?<br> I think he's in the house.<br> What's the matter<br> with all you gloomy pussies?<br> - Nothing.<br> - I know. Let's have a rehearsal.<br> What for?<br> Let's make believe we're on-stage<br> at the festival.<br> - I don't feel like singing.<br> - Not without Frulein Maria.<br> Liesl, get the guitar.<br> Come on, Marta.<br> Everybody into the group.<br> Get in your places.<br> Now be cheerful, right?<br> Give us the key, Liesl.<br> Now, impress me.<br> Gretl, why don't you sing?<br> I can't. I've got a sore finger.<br> But you sang so beautifully<br> the night of the party.<br> Come on, all of you.<br> Try something you know.<br> Enjoy it. Be cheerful.<br> All right, Liesl.<br> The hills are alive<br> With the sound of music<br> With songs they have sung<br> For a thousand years<br> The hills fill my heart<br> With the sound of music<br> They wanted to sing for me,<br> bless their hearts.<br> That's lovely, lovely.<br> Don't stop.<br> - Something long and cool, Georg?<br> - No, thank you, darling.<br> - Father?<br> - Yes, Brigitta?<br> Is it true Frulein Maria<br> isn't coming back?<br> Yes, I suppose it's true.<br> What have we got here?<br> - Pink lemonade.<br> - Laced with lemonade.<br> I don't believe it, Father.<br> - What?<br> - About Frulein Maria.<br> Oh, Frulein Maria!<br> Didn't I tell you what her note said?<br> I'm sure I did.<br> She said she missed her life<br> at the abbey.<br> She had to leave us.<br> And that's all there is to it.<br> I think I'm brave enough to try<br> some of that.<br> - She didn't even say goodbye.<br> - She did in her note.<br> That isn't the same thing.<br> Not too sweet, not too sour.<br> Just too pink.<br> Father, who is our new governess<br> going to be?<br> Well...<br> ...you're not going to have<br> a governess anymore.<br> - We're not?<br> - No.<br> You're going to have a new mother.<br> A new mother?<br> We talked about it last night.<br> It's all settled.<br> And we're all going to be very happy.<br> Well, all right, all right.<br> Run off and play.<br> Yes, my children?<br> - My name is Liesl.<br> - Yes, Liesl?<br> We, my brothers and sisters,<br> want to see Frulein Maria.<br> Frulein Maria?<br> Oh, Maria.<br> Come in, please.<br> Wait here.<br> I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand<br> you inquired about Maria.<br> We have to see her.<br> Will you tell her we're here?<br> - I'm afraid I can't do that.<br> - But you've got to!<br> - She's our governess.<br> - We want her back.<br> She didn't even say goodbye.<br> All we want to do is talk to her.<br> I'm very sorry,<br> but Maria is in seclusion.<br> - She hasn't been seeing anyone.<br> - She'll see us.<br> I want to show her my finger.<br> Some other time, dear.<br> I'll tell her you were here.<br> - It was sweet of you to call.<br> - We have to speak to her!<br> Run along, children.<br> Run along home.<br> I'm sure she'd like to see us.<br> Sister Margaretta, please.<br> - Goodbye, children.<br> - Sister Margaretta, may we, please?<br> What was that about, Sister?<br> The von Trapp children,<br> Reverend Mother.<br> They want to see Maria.<br> Has she spoken yet?<br> Has she told you anything?<br> She doesn't say a word,<br> Reverend Mother, except in prayer.<br> Poor child.<br> It's strange.<br> She seems happy to be back here...<br> ...and yet she's unhappy too.<br> Perhaps I have been wrong<br> in leaving her alone so long.<br> Bring her to me,<br> even if she's not yet ready.<br> Yes, Reverend Mother.<br> Sister Augusta, take our new postulant<br> to the robing room.<br> God bless you, my daughter.<br> Yes, bring her in.<br> You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.<br> Reverend Mother.<br> Why did they send you back to us?<br> They didn't send me back.<br> I left.<br> Sit down, Maria.<br> Tell me what happened.<br> I was frightened.<br> - Frightened? Were they unkind to you.<br> - Oh, no!<br> No, I was confused. I felt...<br> I've never felt that way before.<br> I couldn't stay. I knew that here<br> I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.<br> Maria, our abbey is not to be used<br> as an escape.<br> What is it you can't face?<br> I can't face him again.<br> Him?<br> Thank you, Sister Margaretta.<br> Captain von Trapp?<br> - Are you in love with him?<br> - I don't know!<br> I don't know. I...<br> The baroness said I was.<br> She said that he was in love with me.<br> But I didn't want to believe it.<br> There were times we looked<br> at each other.<br> I could hardly breathe.<br> - Did you let him see your feelings?<br> - I don't know.<br> That's what's torturing me.<br> I was on God's errand.<br> To have asked for his love would have<br> been wrong. I just couldn't stay.<br> I'm ready at this moment<br> to take my vows.<br> - Please help me.<br> - Maria.<br> The love of a man and a woman is holy.<br> You have a great capacity to love.<br> You must find out how God<br> wants you to spend your love.<br> But I pledged my life to God.<br> I pledged my life to his service.<br> My daughter, if you love this man,<br> it doesn't mean you love God less.<br> No.<br> You must find out.<br> You must go back.<br> You can't ask me to do that.<br> - Please let me stay. I beg...<br> - Maria.<br> These walls were not built<br> to shut out problems.<br> You have to face them.<br> You have to live the life<br> you were born to live.<br> Climb every mountain<br> Search high and low<br> Follow every byway<br> Every path you know<br> Climb every mountain<br> Ford every stream<br> Follow every rainbow<br> Till you find your dream<br> A dream that will need<br> All the love you can give<br> Every day of your life<br> For as long as you live<br> Climb every mountain<br> Ford every stream<br> Follow every rainbow<br> Till you find your dream<br> A dream that will need<br> All the love you can give<br> Every day of your life<br> For as long as you live<br> Climb every mountain<br> Ford every stream<br> Follow every rainbow<br> Till you find...<br> ...your dream<br> Now, it's not like my children<br> to be secretive.<br> We're not being secretive, Father.<br> And it's not like my children<br> to be late for dinner.<br> - We lost track of the time.<br> - I see.<br> Who's going to be the first one<br> to tell me the truth? Friedrich.<br> Brigitta. Liesl.<br> Where do you think we were, Father?<br> If you don't believe us, you must have<br> some idea of where you think we were.<br> - Marta.<br> - Yes, Father.<br> You tell me.<br> Friedrich told you, Father.<br> We were berry picking.<br> - I forgot! You were berry picking.<br> - Yes, we love berry picking.<br> All afternoon?<br> - We picked thousands.<br> - Thousands?<br> - They were all over the place.<br> - What kind of berries?<br> - Blueberries, sir.<br> - Blueberries.<br> It's too early for blueberries.<br> - They were strawberries.<br> - Strawberries?<br> It's been so cold lately,<br> they turned blue.<br> Very well. Show me the berries.<br> - We...<br> - Well...<br> - Show me the berries you picked.<br> - We don't have them.<br> You don't have them?<br> What happened to them?<br> - We...<br> - We ate them.<br> - You ate them?<br> - Yes!<br> - They were so good.<br> - Delicious.<br> Very well.<br> Since you've obviously stuffed<br> yourselves on thousands of berries...<br> ...you can't be hungry anymore,<br> so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt...<br> ...to skip your dinner.<br> It's your fault.<br> We should have told him the truth.<br> And made him boiling mad at us?<br> It's better than starving to death.<br> We didn't do anything wrong.<br> We just wanted to see her.<br> My stomach's making noises.<br> The least they could have done<br> was to let us say hello.<br> - I wonder what grass tastes like.<br> - I feel awful.<br> When Frulein Maria wanted to feel<br> better she used to sing that song.<br> Let's try it.<br> Raindrops on roses<br> And whiskers on kittens<br> Bright copper kettles<br> And warm woolen mittens<br> Brown paper packages<br> Tied up with strings<br> These are a few of my favorite things<br> Why don't I feel better?<br> Girls in white dresses<br> With blue satin sashes<br> Snowflakes that stay<br> On my nose and eyelashes<br> - Silver white winters...<br> - Frulein Maria's back!<br> ...that melt into springs<br> These are a few of my favorite things<br> When the dog bites<br> When the bee stings<br> When I'm feeling sad<br> I simply remember my favorite things<br> And then I don't feel<br> So bad<br> - Children, I'm so glad to see you.<br> - We missed you.<br> I missed you.<br> - Kurt, how are you?<br> - Hungry.<br> - What happened to your finger?<br> - It got caught.<br> - Caught in what?<br> - Friedrich's teeth.<br> - Liesl, you all right?<br> - Just fair.<br> - Any telegrams been delivered lately?<br> - None at all.<br> But I'm learning to accept it.<br> I'll be glad when school begins.<br> Liesl, you can't use school to escape<br> your problems. You have to face them.<br> I have so much to tell you.<br> We have things to tell you too.<br> The most important thing is<br> that Father is going to be married.<br> Married?<br> Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Father, look!<br> Frulein Maria's back!<br> Frulein Maria's back from the abbey.<br> Good evening, captain.<br> Good evening.<br> Everyone inside for dinner.<br> Dinner!<br> You left without saying goodbye.<br> Even to the children.<br> It was wrong of me. Forgive me.<br> Why did you?<br> Please don't ask me.<br> The reason no longer exists.<br> Frulein Maria, you've returned.<br> Isn't it wonderful, Georg?<br> I wish you every happiness,<br> baroness.<br> You too, captain.<br> The children say you're to marry.<br> Thank you, my dear.<br> You are back to stay?<br> Only until arrangements can be made<br> for another governess.<br> There you are.<br> I must speak to cook<br> about the schnitzel.<br> It is entirely too delicious<br> for my figure.<br> And it makes you much too quiet<br> at the dinner table.<br> Or was it the wine?<br> Undoubtedly the wine.<br> You have no idea<br> the trouble I'm having...<br> ...trying to decide on<br> a wedding present for you.<br> Oh, I know. I'm enough.<br> But I do want you to have<br> some little trifle for the occasion.<br> At first I thought<br> of a fountain pen...<br> ...but you've already got one.<br> Then I thought perhaps a villa<br> in the south of France...<br> ...but they are so difficult<br> to gift-wrap.<br> Oh, Georg, how do you<br> feel about yachts?<br> A long, sleek one<br> for the Mediterranean...<br> ...or a tiny one<br> for your bathtub, huh?<br> - Elsa.<br> - Where to go on our honeymoon?<br> Now, that's a real problem.<br> A trip around the world<br> would be lovely. And then I said:<br> "Oh, Elsa, there must be<br> someplace better to go."<br> - But don't worry, darling, I'll...<br> - Elsa.<br> Yes, Georg.<br> It's no use...<br> ...you and I.<br> I'm being dishonest to both of us...<br> ...and utterly unfair to you.<br> - When two people talk of marriage...<br> - No, don't.<br> Don't say another word, please.<br> You see, there are other things<br> I've been thinking of.<br> Fond as I am of you, I really don't<br> think you're the right man for me.<br> You're much too independent.<br> And I need someone<br> who needs me desperately...<br> ...or at least needs<br> my money desperately.<br> I've enjoyed every moment we've had<br> together and I do thank you for that.<br> Now, if you'll forgive me...<br> ...I'll go inside,<br> pack my little bags...<br> ...and return to Vienna<br> where I belong.<br> And somewhere out there...<br> ...is a young lady who, I think...<br> ...will never be a nun.<br> Auf Wiedersehen, darling.<br> Hello.<br> I thought I just might find you here.<br> Was there something you wanted?<br> No, no, no. Sit down, please.<br> Please.<br> May I?<br> You know, I was thinking<br> and I was wondering two things:<br> Why did you run away to the abbey?<br> And what was it<br> that made you come back?<br> Well, I had an obligation<br> to fulfill...<br> ...and I came back to fulfill it.<br> Is that all?<br> And I missed the children.<br> Yes.<br> - Only the children?<br> - No. Yes.<br> - Isn't it right that I missed them?<br> - Oh, yes. Yes, of course.<br> I was only hoping that perhaps you...<br> Perhaps you might...<br> Yes?<br> Well, nothing was the same<br> when you were away...<br> ...and it'll be all wrong again<br> after you leave...<br> ...and I just thought perhaps<br> you might change your mind.<br> Well, I'm sure the baroness will be<br> able to make things fine for you.<br> Maria...<br> - There isn't going to be any baroness.<br> - There isn't?<br> No.<br> I don't understand.<br> Well, we've called off our engagement,<br> you see, and...<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - Yes. You are?<br> - You did?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, you can't marry someone<br> when you're...<br> ...in love with someone else...<br> ...can you?<br> The Reverend Mother always says:<br> "When the Lord closes a door,<br> somewhere He opens a window."<br> What else does<br> the Reverend Mother say?<br> That you have to look for your life.<br> Is that why you came back?<br> And have you found it...<br> ...Maria?<br> I think I have.<br> I know I have.<br> I love you.<br> Oh, can this be happening to me?<br> Perhaps I had a wicked childhood<br> Perhaps I had a miserable youth<br> But somewhere<br> In my wicked, miserable past<br> There must have been a moment of truth<br> For here you are<br> Standing there loving me<br> Whether or not you should<br> So somewhere in my youth or childhood<br> I must have done something good<br> Nothing comes from nothing<br> Nothing ever could<br> So somewhere in my youth or childhood<br> I must have done something good<br> Do you know when I first<br> started loving you?<br> That night at dinner, when you sat<br> on that ridiculous pine cone.<br> What?<br> I knew the first time you blew<br> that silly whistle.<br> Oh, my love.<br> For here you are<br> Standing there loving me<br> Whether or not you should<br> So somewhere in my youth or childhood<br> I must have done something good<br> Nothing comes from nothing<br> Nothing ever could<br> So somewhere in my youth...<br> ...or childhood<br> I must have done something<br> Something good<br> Maria.<br> Is there anyone I should go to,<br> to ask permission to marry you?<br> - Why don't we ask...<br> - The children?<br> How do you solve a problem like Maria?<br> How do you catch a cloud<br> And pin it down?<br> How do you find a word<br> That means Maria?<br> A flibbertigibbet<br> A will-o'-the-wisp<br> A clown<br> Many a thing you know<br> You'd like to tell her<br> Many a thing she ought to understand<br> But how do you make her stay<br> And listen to all you say?<br> How do you keep a wave upon the sand?<br> Oh, how do you solve<br> A problem like Maria?<br> How do you hold a moonbeam<br> In your hand?<br> Herr Detweiler!<br> - Heil Hitler.<br> - Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.<br> Perhaps you've not heard.<br> I am now the Gauleiter.<br> Heil Hitler.<br> Heil Hitler.<br> I've come from<br> Captain von Trapp's house.<br> The only one in the area<br> not flying the Third Reich flag...<br> ...since the Anschluss.<br> - But we have dealt with that.<br> - I don't...<br> The housekeeper told me<br> that I would find you here.<br> The only thing she'd tell me.<br> What kind of information<br> are you looking for?<br> When will the captain return?<br> Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.<br> He's not been in touch with us.<br> Am I to believe he hasn't communicated<br> with his children in over a month?<br> How many men do you know...<br> ...who communicate with their children<br> while honeymooning?<br> Upon his return, he'll fill<br> his proper position in the new order.<br> Naturally.<br> And may I congratulate you...<br> ...and your people in allowing the<br> festival to go on tonight as planned.<br> Why should it not go on?<br> Nothing in Austria has changed.<br> Singing and music will<br> show this to the world.<br> Austria is the same.<br> Heil Hitler.<br> Heil Hitler.<br> Come, let's go home.<br> - Why was he so cross?<br> - Everybody's cross these days.<br> Maybe the flag with the black spider<br> makes people nervous.<br> - Will Father be in trouble?<br> - He doesn't have to be.<br> The thing to do<br> is to get along with everybody.<br> Remember that tonight at the concert.<br> Are we really going to sing<br> before a lot of people?<br> Look. The von Trapp Family Singers:<br> Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta,<br> Kurt, Marta and Gretl.<br> - Why am I always last?<br> - Because you are the most important.<br> There we go.<br> Are you sure Father will approve<br> of our singing in public?<br> He'll be pleased and proud.<br> - Liesl, do you think so?<br> - Don't you trust me?<br> No.<br> You're a very intelligent girl.<br> Liesl. Liesl!<br> Rolfe!<br> I'm so glad to see you.<br> It's been su...<br> Good afternoon.<br> Give this to your father<br> as soon as he's home.<br> - He's on his honeymoon.<br> - I know.<br> - You do?<br> - We make it our business to know all.<br> - Who's "we"?<br> - See that he gets it.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's a telegram from Berlin.<br> Don't you want to deliver it yourself?<br> I'm occupied<br> with more important matters.<br> And your father had better be too.<br> But, Rolfe!<br> Father!<br> - We didn't expect you so soon.<br> - Hello, hello!<br> We didn't expect you home<br> until next week!<br> - Did you bring souvenirs from Paris?<br> - Hello! How are you?<br> Why didn't you call us?<br> We couldn't get through.<br> I had nothing to do with that.<br> We came back as fast as we could.<br> Well, well, well! We missed you!<br> - We missed you!<br> - We missed kissing you.<br> We missed all the noise<br> in the morning.<br> - Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.<br> - Oh, you came back just in time.<br> Look, Frulein Maria...<br> I mean Mother.<br> We're going to sing<br> in the festival tonight.<br> We've been having a lovely time!<br> We've been rehearsing all...<br> Surprise! Surprise!<br> Surprises for you on the terrace.<br> We'll talk about this.<br> I would've told you but you were away.<br> I had to make a last-minute decision.<br> I was fortunate to enter them at all.<br> They'll be the talk of the festival.<br> Imagine, seven children in one family!<br> Max!<br> Somehow I recall having made it<br> quite clear to you...<br> ...how I feel about my family<br> singing in public!<br> The committee was enchanted.<br> - What did they say?<br> - I have never heard such enthusiasm.<br> - Don't you think just this once...?<br> - Absolutely out of the question.<br> - Georg, this is for Austria.<br> - For Austria?<br> - There is no Austria!<br> - But the Anschluss was peaceful.<br> - Let's at least be grateful for that.<br> - Grateful?<br> You know, Max...<br> ...sometimes I don't believe<br> I know you.<br> Father, I forgot.<br> This is for you.<br> Maria, he has got to at least pretend<br> to work with these people.<br> You must convince him.<br> Max, I can't ask him<br> to be less than he is.<br> Then I'll talk to him.<br> If the children don't sing, well...<br> ...it will be a reflection<br> on Austria.<br> Oh, I know.<br> It wouldn't do me any good either.<br> Mother? That sounds so nice.<br> - I like calling you "Mother."<br> - I like hearing it.<br> You love Father very much.<br> I can tell you do.<br> Very much.<br> Mother, what do you do when you<br> think you love someone?<br> I mean, when you stop loving someone<br> or he stops loving you?<br> Well, you cry a little.<br> Then you wait for the sun to come out.<br> It always does.<br> There are so many things I think<br> I should know but I don't.<br> - I really don't.<br> - How can you?<br> Sometimes I feel the world is ending.<br> - Then you feel it's just beginning?<br> - Yes!<br> It was that way with me. And for you<br> it will be just as wonderful.<br> Do you really think so?<br> When you're 16 going on 17<br> Waiting for life to start<br> Somebody kind<br> Who touches your mind<br> Will suddenly touch your heart<br> When that happens<br> After it happens<br> Nothing is quite the same<br> Somehow I know<br> I'll jump up and go<br> If ever he calls my name<br> Gone are your old ideas of life<br> The old ideas grow dim<br> Lo and behold<br> You're someone's wife<br> And you belong to him<br> You may think this kind of adventure<br> Never may come to you<br> Darling, 16 going on 17<br> Wait a year...<br> - I'll wait a year<br> ...or two<br> Just wait a year...<br> ...or two<br> Liesl.<br> What is it?<br> Berlin.<br> They've offered me a commission.<br> I've been requested<br> to accept immediately...<br> ...and report to their naval base<br> at Bremerhaven tomorrow.<br> I knew this would happen.<br> I didn't think it would be so soon.<br> To refuse them would be fatal<br> for all of us.<br> And joining them would be unthinkable.<br> Get the children all together.<br> Don't say anything to worry them.<br> Just get them ready.<br> We've got to get out of Austria...<br> ...and this house...<br> ...tonight.<br> This strains my back<br> and breaks my heart...<br> ...when I think of the children<br> missing the festival.<br> By your announcement<br> we'll be over the border.<br> Do you appreciate<br> the sacrifice I'm making?<br> You have no choice.<br> I know. That's why I'm making it.<br> Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?<br> Because he doesn't want anyone<br> to hear us.<br> What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?<br> They'll be able to answer honestly<br> they didn't know anything.<br> - Will we be coming back here?<br> - Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.<br> Are Father and Uncle Max going to push<br> the car all the way to Switzerland?<br> Something wrong<br> with your car, captain?<br> Yes, we couldn't get it started.<br> Karl.<br> Fix Captain von Trapp's car<br> so that it will start.<br> Excellent, Karl.<br> I've not asked you where you<br> and your family are going.<br> Nor have you asked me why I'm here.<br> Apparently we both suffer<br> from a deplorable lack of curiosity.<br> You never answered the telegram...<br> ...from the Admiral of the Navy<br> of the Third Reich.<br> I was under the impression,<br> Herr Zeller...<br> ...that the contents of telegrams<br> in Austria are private!<br> At least, the Austria I know.<br> I have my orders...<br> ...to take you<br> to Bremerhaven tonight...<br> ...where you will accept<br> your commission.<br> I'm afraid that's going to be<br> quite impossible.<br> You see, we...<br> ...all of us, the entire family,<br> will be...<br> ...singing in the festival tonight.<br> As a matter of fact, we're going now.<br> We couldn't possibly<br> let them down now.<br> - I just hope we're not too late.<br> - Yes.<br> You ask me to believe that you,<br> Captain von Trapp...<br> ...are singing in a concert?<br> Believe me, it will be a performance<br> beyond anything even I've dreamt of.<br> Like you, Herr Zeller,<br> I, too, am a man of hidden talents.<br> Yes.<br> Here, program.<br> It says only the names<br> of the children.<br> It says<br> the von Trapp Family Singers...<br> ...and I am the head of<br> the von Trapp family, am I not?<br> And these travel clothes<br> that you're all wearing?<br> Our costumes, naturally.<br> This night air is not good<br> for the children's voices.<br> Well, a slight delay in my orders<br> will not be serious.<br> Therefore...<br> ...you will sing.<br> You will all sing.<br> But only because that's what I want.<br> It will demonstrate that nothing<br> in Austria has changed.<br> And when you have finished singing...<br> ...you, Captain von Trapp, will be<br> taken to Bremerhaven.<br> Now, if you will all get<br> into your car...<br> ...we will escort the von Trapp Family<br> Singers to the festival.<br> No escort will be necessary.<br> Necessary? A pleasure, captain.<br> After all, we would not want you<br> to get lost in the crowds.<br> Would we?<br> No.<br> Sew, a needle pulling thread<br> La, a note to follow sew<br> Tea, a drink with jam and bread<br> A drink with jam and bread<br> Tea with jam<br> Jam and bread<br> - With jam<br> - A, B, C<br> - With jam<br> - Do-re-mi<br> Tea with jam and bread<br> With jam and bread<br> With jam<br> With jam...<br> ...and bread<br> My fellow Austrians...<br> ...I shall not be seeing you again,<br> perhaps for a very long time.<br> I would like to sing for you now...<br> ...a love song.<br> I know you share this love.<br> I pray that you will never let it die.<br> Edelweiss<br> Edelweiss<br> Every morning you greet me<br> Small and white<br> Clean and bright<br> You look happy to meet me<br> Blossom of snow<br> May you bloom and grow<br> Bloom and grow forever<br> Edelweiss<br> Edelweiss<br> Bless my homeland forever<br> Edelweiss<br> Edel...<br> Small and white<br> Clean and bright<br> You look happy to meet me<br> Blossom of snow<br> May you bloom and grow<br> Bloom and grow forever<br> Edelweiss<br> Edelweiss<br> Bless my homeland forever<br> I think it'll work.<br> I shall miss all of you.<br> I shall miss the money<br> I could have made with you.<br> Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.<br> The competition has come<br> to its conclusion...<br> ...except, we don't know<br> yet what that conclusion will be.<br> And while the judges<br> arrive at their decision...<br> ...I have been given permission<br> to offer you an encore.<br> This will be the last opportunity<br> the von Trapps will have...<br> ...of singing together<br> for a long, long time.<br> Even now, officials are waiting<br> in this auditorium...<br> ...to escort Captain von Trapp<br> to his new command...<br> ...in the naval forces<br> of the Third Reich.<br> And so, ladies and gentlemen,<br> the family von Trapp again...<br> ...to bid you farewell.<br> There's a sad sort of clanging<br> From the clock in the hall<br> And the bells in the steeple too<br> And up in the nursery<br> An absurd little bird<br> Is popping out to say "coo-coo"<br> Coo-coo<br> Coo-coo<br> Regretfully they tell us<br> But firmly they compel us<br> To say goodbye<br> To you<br> So long, farewell<br> Auf Wiedersehen, good night<br> We hate to go<br> And miss this pretty sight<br> So long, farewell<br> Auf Wiedersehen, adieu<br> Adieu, adieu<br> To you and you and you<br> So long, farewell<br> Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye<br> We flit, we float<br> We fleetly flee, we fly<br> So long, farewell<br> Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye<br> The sun has gone to bed<br> And so must I<br> Goodbye<br> Goodbye<br> Goodbye<br> Goodbye<br> Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the<br> decision of our distinguished judges.<br> We will start with the award<br> for third prize.<br> For this honor,<br> the judges have named...<br> ...the first soloist of the choir<br> of St. Agatha's Church in Murback.<br> Frulein Schweiger.<br> Second prize<br> to The Toby Reiser Quintet.<br> And the first prize,<br> the highest honor in all Austria...<br> ...the von Trapp Family Singers.<br> The family von Trapp.<br> They're gone!<br> Come with me.<br> Quickly, quickly.<br> I have a place you can hide.<br> Slowly, slowly.<br> Open this gate.<br> Good evening.<br> Hurry up, woman.<br> Two men in there.<br> Six of you cover the yard.<br> You two, cover the corridor.<br> Reverend Mother, we didn't realize<br> we put the abbey in this danger.<br> No, Maria, it was right for you<br> to come here.<br> We thought we might borrow<br> your car.<br> I'm afraid our car will do you<br> no good now.<br> I've been listening to the wires.<br> The borders have just been closed.<br> All right,<br> if the borders are closed...<br> ...then we'll drive up into the hills<br> and go over the mountains on foot.<br> -
