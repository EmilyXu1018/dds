                        -It's in there. Number nine.<br> -Right.<br> Don't stand around.<br> Go on home, all of you.<br> -What happened, constable?<br> -Well...<br> -...there's been another murder.<br> -A murder.<br> There's nothing you can do.<br> I told you to go home. Go on.<br> Oh, just a minute, miss.<br> Are you alone?<br> You work out at the Warren home,<br> don't you?<br> That's nearly two miles from here.<br> You'd better hurry if you're<br> gonna get there before dark.<br> -Got any ideas who did it, constable?<br> -Yeah.<br> Same fella did the first one.<br> Same fella did the second one.<br> But who he is, I don't know.<br> Somebody in this town.<br> Somebody we all know.<br> Somebody we see every day.<br> Might be me. Might be you.<br> Why, how could--? I mean...<br> -...I was here at my desk, anyway.<br> -Oh, be quiet.<br> Didn't know you was called,<br> Dr. Parry.<br> I wasn't. As I was leaving the office,<br> I heard about the murder.<br> Thought I'd see if there's<br> anything I could do.<br> Well, there ain't.<br> Unless, of course...<br> ...you're good enough<br> to uncork a miracle...<br> ...and bring the dead back to life.<br> I don't think I'm that good.<br> There's no sense in you going up.<br> She's dead, all right.<br> Dr. Harvey's up there,<br> and that's what he says. She's dead.<br> Well, in that event, constable,<br> I certainly can't do her any harm.<br> -Hello, Parry.<br> -Dr. Harvey.<br> There's nothing for you to do, unless<br> you're sightseeing.<br> -How was she killed?<br> -Strangled.<br> -She was dead when we got here.<br> -Who was she?<br> That lame girl that<br> worked over at Nelson's.<br> How awful.<br> She was just in my office last week.<br> Did she pay her bill or was this<br> her way of getting out of it?<br> I haven't enough experience<br> to make that sort of joke.<br> Perhaps not, Dr. Parry.<br> -I'll run along.<br> -Oh, just a minute.<br> I hear you were over<br> to see Mr. Stover last night.<br> -Yes, I was.<br> -Don't you know he's my patient?<br> I only went because they called me.<br> They told me that you'd<br> refused to go until morning.<br> -I thought it might be serious.<br> -You've got a lot to learn, young fella.<br> You've only been here a short time.<br> I've been here for a good many years.<br> If I answered all the calls as they<br> came, I wouldn't get any sleep at all.<br> Well, that's why I think there's room<br> for two doctors in this town.<br> Reckon so, but let the competition<br> be on an open plane. Ethics.<br> You get what I mean, Parry?<br> If ever I'm called on an emergency,<br> and you're sleeping...<br> ...I intend to go.<br> That's very noble and ambitious.<br> Don't let anything discourage you.<br> Nothing will.<br> Oh, by the way...<br> ...you might like to see<br> what the Stovers did...<br> ...to that prescription<br> you wrote last night.<br> I'm gonna make some calls, Helen.<br> I'll take you to the crossroads.<br> Were you at the hotel?<br> Wasn't a very nice thing<br> to have happen on your afternoon off.<br> I've been pretty busy lately.<br> I haven't had much of a chance<br> to drop in and see you.<br> But I've been thinking<br> about you a great deal.<br> You haven't any family, Helen.<br> No one else to worry about you.<br> And I got to wondering just<br> how long you were going on like this.<br> I mean, doing the work<br> you're doing at the Warrens'.<br> You wanted to be<br> a nurse or a teacher.<br> You mean, you're going<br> to give up that...<br> ...without making an effort<br> to get your voice back again?<br> Yes, I know, Helen,<br> you did see a doctor once.<br> That was a long time ago.<br> They might have discovered<br> a lot since then.<br> There are specialists in Boston now.<br> I don't want to build<br> your hopes up, Helen...<br> ...but it seems such a shame<br> to give up so easily.<br> You'd rather I wouldn't talk<br> about it, wouldn't you?<br> All right, I won't.<br> You know the words to that tune?<br> Dr. Parry.<br> Dr. Parry.<br> -Hello, Freddy.<br> -Pa's sick, Dr. Parry, bad.<br> They didn't send you for me?<br> Ma sent me for Dr. Harvey,<br> but Pa wants you to come.<br> I'm afraid I can't help you out<br> this time, Freddy.<br> You don't understand.<br> Your father's Dr. Harvey's patient.<br> We'll have to try and find him for you.<br> I'll call him as soon as I get home.<br> Oh, please, Dr. Parry, you come.<br> I want you to come.<br> All right, come on, get in.<br> We'll go up and have a look.<br> I'll run you home afterwards.<br> Afraid you'll be late?<br> Are you sure you'll be all right?<br> You'll go straight home,<br> won't you, Helen?<br> Oh, it's you. Thank heavens.<br> They phoned us about the murder.<br> For a while I thought<br> it might have been you.<br> It's terrible. That's what it is.<br> Horrible.<br> As if it isn't bad enough<br> murdering people...<br> ...but all these defenseless women.<br> First there was the girl<br> with a scar on her face.<br> Then that poor<br> simple-minded creature...<br> ...and now this cripple.<br> It seems like....<br> I guess you've had enough<br> for one afternoon.<br> Now-- Now, get your wet shoes off<br> before you catch your death.<br> And you'd better get up<br> to Mrs. Warren straightaway.<br> She's raising a rumpus<br> with that nurse of hers again.<br> Won't even allow her<br> in the room now.<br> She sent down word for you<br> to go up the moment you came in.<br> Is that someone at the front door?<br> Who's there?<br> I don't understand.<br> I closed that window<br> when the storm started.<br> I'll get a hammer<br> and fix that shutter.<br> It was him!<br> Carleton, bad dog!<br> Out all day and only home in time<br> to get under my feet and break my--<br> You're a no-good loafer,<br> that's what you are.<br> Criminals and murderers loose...<br> ...and you're out courting<br> the neighbor's dog.<br> Oh, Carleton, Carleton,<br> you deserve a good beating.<br> Guess I better dry you first.<br> You'll catch your death of cold,<br> that's what you will.<br> And if you think this is all<br> I've got to do, you're mistaken.<br> I think I better fix that window first.<br> And I hope that Carleton<br> is all that came in.<br> I won't need you.<br> You'd better get up to Mrs. Warren.<br> Helen?<br> Haven't you gone in<br> to Mrs. Warren yet?<br> Hurry along, will you?<br> It's about time. Mrs. Warren's<br> been asking for you all afternoon.<br> She won't let me<br> do anything for her. Oh, no.<br> I'm ordered to sit out in the hallway.<br> Why in the world am I kept on here...<br> ...to nurse someone<br> who can't stand the sight of me?<br> But then, I can't stand<br> the sight of her either.<br> I've nursed some queer<br> ones in my time...<br> ...but she's got them all beat.<br> She's sly too.<br> Even with her eyes shut, she seems<br> to be watching you like an evil spirit.<br> But get in there before she gets<br> herself into another tantrum.<br> I got him before he got me.<br> The tiger, I mean.<br> I was as good as any man.<br> You're not only late,<br> but you're playing games.<br> Why are you so late?<br> Never mind. Never mind.<br> Come here.<br> I hoped you were never<br> coming back...<br> ...that you'd run away.<br> Leave this house tonight<br> if you know what's good for you.<br> You understand?<br> Who's there?<br> I told you to sit in the hall.<br> Why must you spy on me?<br> I'm not spying on you.<br> It's time for your medicine.<br> -Helen can give me my medicine.<br> -I don't know what I'm being paid for.<br> You're being paid to sit in the hall.<br> That's all you're good for. Get out.<br> That was the constable<br> at the front door, professor.<br> He wants to see you.<br> I've asked him to wait<br> in the living room.<br> Thank you.<br> -Put these in order, will you?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -Oh, constable?<br> -Yes, Professor Warren?<br> I'll be with you in just a moment.<br> Blanche, get these ready<br> as quickly as possible.<br> Yes, sir.<br> -Hello, constable.<br> -Hello, professor.<br> -Wouldn't you like to sit down?<br> -Oh, no. No, thanks.<br> You sure got a lot<br> of interesting things here.<br> -What's this?<br> -That? Plant life.<br> You mean to say you can write<br> a whole book about...<br> -...little stuff like this?<br> -Yes.<br> What did you want<br> to see me about?<br> Oh, a couple of things, professor.<br> I hate to bother you<br> at this time of night...<br> ...but I figure it's important enough.<br> You know, there's been<br> another murder.<br> Yes, so I've heard.<br> What I want to say is...<br> ...that we've traced<br> the murderer to this vicinity.<br> -Are you certain?<br> -Yes, that's why I've come here.<br> That's why I'm asking everyone<br> to be careful.<br> Keep your doors<br> and windows locked tonight.<br> Well, I'll see that your orders<br> are carried out, constable.<br> I'm especially worried about<br> that girl who works for you.<br> -Helen?<br> -Yes.<br> You see, every one<br> of those girls murdered...<br> ...had something the matter with her.<br> Something wrong.<br> You mean some sort<br> of an affliction?<br> Yes. Now, my hunch is that this<br> murderer, whoever he is, is--<br> I understand exactly what you mean,<br> and I assure you...<br> ...that I shall be especially<br> careful about Helen.<br> As a matter of fact, I'll see that<br> somebody is with her at all times.<br> Good.<br> Oh, you scared<br> the life out of me, Stephen.<br> I didn't hear you come in.<br> Don't stop typing.<br> How many times have I asked you<br> not to see me when I'm working?<br> It's so embarrassing.<br> -Please, leave me alone.<br> -I can't stay away from you.<br> Now, when am I going to see you,<br> and where?<br> You're not going to see me at all<br> if you don't let me finish this.<br> But I'm so bored. I don't know<br> what to do with myself.<br> Stephen, you're going to get us<br> into trouble. Now, please go.<br> No.<br> Then I'll just have to finish this<br> some place else.<br> Oh, Miss Blanche.<br> Yes, Mr. Warren.<br> Stephen.<br> You remember my stepbrother?<br> I sure do. Haven't seen you<br> in a long time, Mr. Warren.<br> Heard you were back. How'd you<br> leave things over in Europe?<br> I left everything in order.<br> They like you to.<br> -Paris must be quite a town.<br> -Yes, it is.<br> Lots of beautiful women.<br> From what I've seen,<br> they're not so bad here either.<br> Always wanted to go there myself...<br> ...but I've been married<br> since I was 1 6.<br> Never had a chance.<br> Must be pretty exciting.<br> I understand it's been<br> pretty exciting here for you too.<br> -Oh, yes, it has been at that.<br> -Wish there was something I could do.<br> -Don't think there is.<br> -Stephen...<br> ...the constable wants to know<br> if anyone left the house today.<br> Nothing personal, I assure you.<br> I've been asked<br> to check up on everybody.<br> I haven't been out all day,<br> constable.<br> That's all I wanted to know.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Good night.<br> Don't forget to lock your doors.<br> I won't.<br> His stepbrother gave him<br> an accusing look.<br> Oh, professor, could I see you<br> for a moment, please?<br> Would you mind calling him?<br> He doesn't know me.<br> You're not afraid of him, are you?<br> -I'm sure he loves policemen.<br> -I'm not in uniform.<br> All right, Carleton, go away.<br> -Well, good night.<br> -Good night.<br> Anything wrong, Albert? Professor?<br> I just stopped by to tell them the same<br> thing I told you in town today, Oates.<br> -See anything on your way home?<br> -Nope.<br> -Well, good night, professor.<br> -Good night.<br> -Your hat, Oates.<br> -Oh, yeah, keep forgetting.<br> Come along, Carleton.<br> Evening, Helen.<br> Helen, I want to talk<br> to you a moment.<br> Now, Helen, I don't want<br> to frighten you...<br> ...but because<br> of what happened in town...<br> ...we have to be especially careful<br> for the next few days.<br> If you should see anything outside<br> of this house, or even in it...<br> ...that makes you suspicious,<br> I want you to let me know.<br> See that someone else<br> does your outside work.<br> You stay in the house.<br> And don't hesitate to come to me<br> at any hour if you need help.<br> Now you may go up<br> to my stepmother, if you wish.<br> Helen...<br> ...remember what I told you.<br> Don't trust anyone.<br> Leave the fire alone, Helen.<br> Pack your things,<br> leave this house tonight.<br> Too many trees...<br> ...stretch out their branches...<br> ...knock the window...<br> ...try to get in.<br> When it's dark, they move.<br> I've seen them.<br> Creeping up to the house.<br> Go away, my dear.<br> You're such a little girl.<br> I want to take care of you.<br> If you won't leave the house<br> as l-- I ask you to...<br> ...you must sleep<br> in this room tonight.<br> Don't be afraid of me.<br> I wanna take care of you.<br> You see...<br> ...you're not safe, my dear.<br> Oh, leave me alone.<br> You're worse than Nurse Barker.<br> Stop fussing.<br> If you won't leave the house<br> as I ask...<br> ...the least you can do<br> is to leave me alone.<br> Go over there and sit down.<br> Sit down.<br> Stay where you are.<br> I don't need your help.<br> Mind your own business.<br> Helen, what is it?<br> Mother must be worse. Get Albert.<br> Give me the brandy, Helen.<br> It's empty. Is there any more?<br> Give me the ether, then.<br> Don't stand there,<br> give me the ether.<br> Why did you have<br> to come back, Stephen?<br> -Why didn't you stay in Europe?<br> -Mother.<br> There's always trouble<br> when you come, Stephen.<br> Always trouble.<br> Why didn't you stay away?<br> I want Dr. Parry.<br> -Dr. Parry?<br> -Yes.<br> You said you didn't want<br> him here anymore.<br> You and Albert decided that.<br> I want Dr. Parry.<br> Mother, we've given him a chance.<br> You haven't improved any.<br> I'll never improve<br> with that ancient Dr. Harvey.<br> Stupid girl. It's all your fault.<br> You brought on this attack.<br> She deliberately refused<br> to let me have my spectacle case.<br> Mother, Helen wouldn't have any<br> reason for refusing to give it to you.<br> Never mind, never mind.<br> We won't talk about it anymore.<br> Get out now, both of you.<br> Go and call Dr. Parry.<br> Will you be all right?<br> After all these years,<br> you ask me if I'll be all right.<br> Oh, Stephen.<br> Get out. Take that ether with you.<br> Well, Mother, I can see<br> that you're feeling better already.<br> I don't like that ether.<br> I don't think it does any good.<br> But Dr. Parry and Dr. Harvey<br> explained to you...<br> ...that, taken in small quantities, it's<br> a stimulant rather than a depressant.<br> It did help you, didn't it?<br> There's been another murder,<br> hasn't there?<br> Nobody told me.<br> Nobody had to.<br> I always know everything.<br> Oh, Blanche.<br> Oh, Blanche, if you don't come here<br> I'll come over<br> Yes, I'll come over<br> Yes, I'll come over<br> Pale hands I loved<br> beside the Shalimar<br> Now, now.<br> Oh, Steve, I'm so unhappy.<br> Stephen.<br> -Where were you this afternoon?<br> -Why?<br> -Those are mine.<br> -I know.<br> So you've unmasked me.<br> Well, I don't know whether<br> I've unmasked you or not...<br> ...but I don't know why you told him<br> you weren't out when you were.<br> Well, to be honest, I didn't want<br> to discuss it in front of anyone.<br> Well, how stupid of you.<br> If anyone had seen you, you would<br> have made it awkward for all of us.<br> Where were you?<br> -Professor, l--<br> -Blanche...<br> ...would you be good enough<br> to leave us?<br> Let's stop sparring.<br> You're angry because<br> I took Blanche out.<br> You're angry because<br> since I've been home...<br> ...Blanche and I have gotten<br> to know each other pretty well.<br> You know, Stephen,<br> you always did smirk...<br> ...even when you were a child.<br> It's one of the things<br> my father disliked about you.<br> He was my father too.<br> I'm inclined to think that Father<br> was disappointed in both of us.<br> Neither of us fitted his concept<br> of what a real man should be:<br> A gun-toting, hard-drinking,<br> tough-living, God-fearing citizen.<br> He always used to say:<br> ''The strong survive, the weak die.''<br> How wrong he was, Albert...<br> ...because you and I...<br> ...the meek...<br> ...have inherited the earth.<br> I'll be honest with you, Stephen.<br> I don't like you. I never have.<br> I have never trusted you.<br> And you're quite right<br> when you say that I don't like...<br> ...this interest you have in Blanche.<br> And I'll tell you something else.<br> I've had the responsibility<br> of your mother, not mine...<br> ...for years,<br> and I'm tired and strained.<br> Therefore, I think<br> we should make a decision.<br> Either you make up your mind<br> to go away permanently...<br> ...or, if you like,<br> you stay and let me go.<br> Helen...<br> ...you look as though<br> you lost your best friend.<br> You got nothing to worry about.<br> If anybody tried any of<br> their funny business on you...<br> ...I'd soon sock them in the jaw.<br> Look at it this way, Helen.<br> Murder's like a million-dollar lottery.<br> Sure, it is. Listen.<br> You pick up the newspaper.<br> You see someone's picture<br> who's won a million dollars.<br> You pick up another paper.<br> There's a picture of someone<br> who's been murdered.<br> But it's never me and it's never you.<br> It's always somebody else, isn't it?<br> There's safety in numbers, Helen.<br> There's Oates and me<br> and the professor and Stephen.<br> -We'll look after you.<br> -And there's Carleton too.<br> Shouldn't count too much on him.<br> And there's Nurse Barker.<br> She'd be as good as any man.<br> In fact, sometimes<br> I think she is a man.<br> In case you're interested...<br> ...there's someone<br> at the front door.<br> -What do you want?<br> -I was called to see Mrs. Warren.<br> It's Dr. Parry. Was he called?<br> Hello, Helen.<br> I suppose they called<br> Dr. Harvey first.<br> You mean Mrs. Warren<br> asked for me?<br> Well, I've got me a patient now.<br> I'm glad I was called, Helen. I've<br> wanted to have a long talk with you...<br> ...and I'm going to before I leave.<br> -How are you, Dr. Parry?<br> -I'm fine. How are you, Mrs. Warren?<br> Did you know my husband?<br> No, I didn't, Mrs. Warren.<br> Of course not. He died years<br> before you came here.<br> You're a little like him.<br> Firm step, strong hand...<br> ...good eyes.<br> Thank you. I know<br> you were very fond of him.<br> He told me I wasn't as beautiful<br> as his first wife...<br> ...but I was a much better shot.<br> The only kind of beauty he had<br> any respect for was strength.<br> And he had two sons...<br> ...both weaklings.<br> They hated guns and hunting.<br> He used to run away<br> from them, Dr. Parry.<br> Well...<br> ...he got his release from a bottle.<br> And he died as he lived,<br> happily, extravagantly.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, no. You mustn't be.<br> You mustn't be sorry for him.<br> You should try to get some rest,<br> Mrs. Warren.<br> Yes, I know. I talk too much.<br> I talk too much.<br> -Get Helen out of this house.<br> -Why?<br> Because I know you love her.<br> Take her away.<br> Promise me you'll take her<br> away from here.<br> Very well, I promise.<br> Take her away tonight.<br> If it's money you need,<br> I'll get it for you.<br> Get me the ether, Helen.<br> Did you get it?<br> I'll go ask Nurse Barker.<br> Come in, please, nurse.<br> Will you get me the ether?<br> Helen can't find it.<br> It was used about an hour ago.<br> Where did you put it?<br> Let's have another look.<br> It's gone, and you're the only people<br> who have been in this room today.<br> -Unless Mrs. Warren--<br> -You took the ether, Barker.<br> Why, I did no such thing.<br> You always make me sit outside.<br> Never mind. Maybe<br> Professor Warren will know about it.<br> I'll go and see him.<br> Here, where's my brandy?<br> I finished it for your own good.<br> Well, I wish you'd stop<br> doing things for my own good.<br> With everything that's happening,<br> it's better that you keep your wits.<br> I'm never more witty than<br> when I've had a little nip.<br> I see better, I hear better,<br> and I feel much better.<br> Oates, would you mind coming out<br> a moment? Bring your hat and coat.<br> There it is.<br> Emma, let's be serious for a minute.<br> I want you to stay awake<br> until I get back.<br> Keep an eye on Helen.<br> I won't be long.<br> I could keep a much better eye<br> on Helen if I'd had a little nip.<br> I can't understand.<br> Ether was used<br> less than two hours ago.<br> Stephen used it.<br> He said Helen gave it to him.<br> Unfortunately,<br> I have no other supply.<br> Oates, I'm afraid you'll have to go<br> into the village for some ether.<br> It's stormy out.<br> Does it have to be done?<br> If it didn't have to be done,<br> I wouldn't ask.<br> All right, all right, I'll go.<br> He won't find any in the village.<br> I tried to get some.<br> I have to go to Morristown.<br> It'll take hours.<br> I'm sorry, it's an emergency.<br> We have to have it.<br> You're sorry, but I have to go.<br> You should have<br> some other stimulant at hand.<br> -Brandy? I'll get a bottle.<br> -That will do.<br> -Will you ask Helen to come for it?<br> -Yeah.<br> Mrs. Oates.<br> Yes, sir?<br> Come along with me<br> while I get a bottle of brandy.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Oh, dear, now I've done it.<br> -Did you bring a match?<br> -No, sir.<br> Oh, well, never mind.<br> Perhaps I have one.<br> Here we are.<br> I think it rolled over there, sir.<br> I'll take it this time, Mrs. Oates.<br> Your key, sir.<br> Oh, my.<br> Did I put one over on him.<br> Easy as taking candy from a baby.<br> Take a tip from me, Helen.<br> If you carry the candle<br> to the cellar for the professor...<br> ...and you fancy a bottle<br> of his fine old brandy...<br> ...just throw the candle to one side.<br> Accidentally on purpose, of course.<br> Anything can happen in the dark.<br> Presto.<br> Now, I'll just wipe this off...<br> ...and you can take it to Dr. Parry.<br> Helen.<br> Come into the den.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> Mrs. Warren's asleep.<br> Professor Warren's with her now.<br> I've been thinking things over.<br> And Mrs. Warren's right.<br> You should come with me tonight.<br> You can stay at my mother's place...<br> ...until we can make arrangements<br> to go to Boston.<br> My mother will like you.<br> I don't wanna frighten you, but you<br> heard Mrs. Warren a while ago.<br> Her mind's growing steadily worse,<br> and I'm afraid she may become violent.<br> She seems obsessed by the idea<br> that you get out of this house.<br> And there may be<br> something back of it.<br> You'll go with me tonight.<br> There are doctors in Boston<br> who'll know all about your case.<br> I want to take you there.<br> Helen.<br> When I left you this afternoon,<br> I dropped in at the Fabers'.<br> They have a guest visiting them<br> from your hometown.<br> A Mrs. Lindstrom.<br> You know her?<br> Well...<br> ...she told me a story about a girl.<br> A girl who was on her way home<br> from school one day.<br> She had good news for her parents.<br> When she wasn't far<br> from her home...<br> ...she heard a fire engine<br> rushing down the street.<br> She started to run,<br> and when she turned the corner...<br> ...she saw that it was her home<br> that was in flames.<br> There was a crowd outside.<br> She wanted to scream herself,<br> but somehow she couldn't.<br> She tried to rush into the house...<br> ...but was held back<br> because it was hopeless.<br> So without being able<br> to do one thing to help...<br> ...she saw her mother and father<br> burn to death.<br> I'm sorry, Helen, but I had to do it.<br> It's only because<br> I wanted to help you.<br> Go over everything<br> that happened that day.<br> Have the courage to see it all again.<br> And by not blocking it out of your<br> mind, you may find your voice again.<br> I don't like being an outsider,<br> and you shouldn't either.<br> I know what I'm talking about<br> because I'm an outsider here myself.<br> A lot of people don't want me.<br> They want me to quit.<br> But I won't, because there's at least<br> one person who wants me here...<br> ...and that's good enough for me.<br> And there's one person<br> who wants you to talk...<br> ...and that ought to be<br> good enough for you. Look at me.<br> Look at me.<br> Remember how wonderful<br> it was when you had a voice?<br> When you could say ''hello''<br> or ''thank you''?<br> When you could yell back<br> at someone picking at you?<br> I do it all the time.<br> You look at me as though you don't<br> believe it, but I know I'm right.<br> Try to talk! Try it! Try it!<br> Excuse me.<br> My mother is asking for you, Helen.<br> I'll speak to Professor Warren<br> about your leaving.<br> What is this about Helen leaving?<br> I'll discuss it with your brother.<br> Is it something you<br> can't discuss with me?<br> Why is she leaving?<br> Where is she going?<br> Well, I've been doing a great deal<br> of thinking about Helen.<br> I know her condition<br> is due to shock.<br> I'm sure a new mental therapy<br> can restore her voice.<br> I'd like to take her to Boston.<br> Aren't you taking<br> a tremendous responsibility?<br> Building up her hopes.<br> Making her think there's some<br> miracle in store for her.<br> It's up to her, not you.<br> What you're doing<br> is cruel and foolish.<br> That girl is adjusted to her affliction.<br> I think you should let it go at that.<br> Suppose you let me<br> mind my own business.<br> It so happens I don't think much<br> of your business, Dr. Parry.<br> If there is a solution<br> to her problem...<br> ...it ought to be in the hands of<br> someone other than a hick doctor.<br> The thing that keeps me<br> from cracking you in the jaw...<br> ...is the almost certain possibility<br> that it would break your neck.<br> What's the trouble, doctor?<br> The good country doctor,<br> having lost his wits...<br> ...was about to resort to his fists.<br> Professor Warren, I know you're<br> interested in Helen's welfare.<br> I've told you what I've learned.<br> I've decided it's for her best interest...<br> -...that she leave here tonight.<br> -Tonight?<br> She can stay at my mother's<br> until we can take her to Boston...<br> ...for the examination<br> first thing in the morning.<br> Doctor, you know<br> that I agree with you...<br> ...about the element of hope<br> that you have for Helen...<br> ...but what's your reason for<br> suddenly making her leave tonight?<br> Well, Mrs. Warren feels...<br> ...that she's in danger here.<br> Surely you don't take the ramblings<br> of a sick woman seriously.<br> I take most things seriously.<br> But, doctor, there are many<br> other considerations.<br> Helen needs this position.<br> It's her only means of support.<br> No family. It won't be easy--<br> I've thought of all those things,<br> professor.<br> I....<br> I intend to take care of her.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Well, I'm very glad for you<br> and for her.<br> You're a sentimentalist, doctor.<br> Are your humanitarian instincts<br> restricted...<br> ...only to people<br> with serious afflictions?<br> You're very insolent.<br> Dr. Parry.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hello?<br> Yes, he is. Just a moment.<br> -It's for you, doctor.<br> -Thank you.<br> Hello?<br> Helen...<br> ...the Wilson boy is sick.<br> I have to go over there.<br> Now, here's their phone number.<br> You can pack while I'm gone.<br> If you need anything before<br> I get back, have Mrs. Oates call me.<br> I'll be back as soon as I can.<br> Be sure and bar the door<br> behind me.<br> And don't let anyone in but me.<br> Wilt thou obey him...<br> ...serve him...<br> ...Iove, honor and keep him,<br> in sickness and in health...<br> ...and forsaking all others...<br> ...keep thee only unto him...<br> ...so long as ye both shall live?<br> Signify by saying, ''I do.''<br> Say, ''I do.''<br> Say, ''I do.''<br> Say, ''I do.''<br> Say, ''I do.''<br> Say, ''I do.''<br> Say, ''I do.''<br> Say, ''I do.''<br> Say, ''I do. ''<br> Say, ''I do. ''<br> What's the matter, Helen?<br> Don't you feel well?<br> I understand you're<br> going to leave us.<br> Well, I don't know whether<br> Dr. Parry is right or wrong...<br> ...but I agree that you should have<br> that chance to go to Boston.<br> And I want you to understand if things<br> don't work out satisfactorily...<br> ...that you're always<br> welcome to come here.<br> Now, you run along.<br> I like to see women cry.<br> Men like to see women cry.<br> It makes them feel superior.<br> Oh, Steve...<br> ...I'm very unhappy...<br> ...and upset.<br> You dramatize everything, Blanche.<br> We've been very happy.<br> At least, I have.<br> -I don't like your attitude at all.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> It's just, I'm-- I'm making trouble<br> between you and your stepbrother.<br> I don't like to hide anything I feel.<br> And you know how I feel about you.<br> That's very sweet of you, Blanche.<br> But are you sure<br> you're telling me the truth?<br> Truth about what?<br> Just that I think you're<br> uncomfortable because of your...<br> ...past relationship with my brother.<br> -You are a--<br> -Don't say it.<br> Just answer my question.<br> Get out.<br> Don't be so melodramatic.<br> I didn't realize you were so strong.<br> I'm leaving here.<br> I never want to see you again.<br> I'll miss you.<br> A house like this needs charm.<br> I told you to get out.<br> You're going to regret this.<br> I'm sorry to intrude, Helen.<br> I have a favor to ask of you.<br> You're leaving tonight,<br> and I want to go into town with you.<br> I'm happy for you.<br> Things will be so different<br> when you're cured.<br> I don't know what will become of me,<br> but I've got to leave this house.<br> It hasn't been good for anyone here.<br> I'm only taking a few things with me.<br> Oates can pick up<br> my other things tomorrow.<br> My suitcase is in the basement.<br> I'll only be a few minutes.<br> This is the second time<br> I've closed that window tonight.<br> I definitely know I did.<br> Now, if only I knew who opened it.<br> You're not that clever,<br> and if you were....<br> Oh, it's you.<br> You scared the life out of me.<br> I told you not to touch me. Get out.<br> I'll get out, Mrs. Warren.<br> Not only out of here...<br> -...but out of this house.<br> -Good riddance.<br> But before I go, you're going<br> to hear a few things.<br> I'm tired of being a target<br> for an evil old woman.<br> Nobody's asking you to stay.<br> If you got down<br> on your knees, I wouldn't stay.<br> -I don't need this job.<br> -Why don't you go?<br> You need a keeper, not a nurse.<br> I don't care if you never walk again.<br> You can stay in that bed<br> for the rest of your life.<br> I've taken everything,<br> but I'll not put up with this.<br> I'm leaving this house tonight.<br> I'll soon clear them out.<br> I hate nurses. Always fussing.<br> Always washing your face.<br> Helen.<br> Did you know there was a girl<br> murdered here a long time ago?<br> I saw it.<br> Upstairs, from the window.<br> It was getting dark.<br> I thought it was a tree in the garden.<br> Stood so still...<br> ...and waited.<br> Then when the poor, simple-minded<br> creature came near the house...<br> ...the tree moved...<br> ...threw her into the well.<br> I was too late.<br> I couldn't find the rope.<br> You were that girl, Helen.<br> Come here.<br> Come here.<br> You must go away.<br> Leave this house.<br> Go with Nurse Barker tonight.<br> Don't wait for Dr. Parry.<br> Don't wait for anyone.<br> If you won't,<br> you must do what I tell you.<br> You must get under the bed.<br> Do you understand?<br> You must hide under the bed.<br> Why won't you do what I tell you to?<br> Why won't you listen to me?<br> Why won't anyone listen to me?<br> Would you mind<br> letting me have a wagon?<br> I'll leave it in the village<br> for Oates to pick up.<br> Very well. I'll go out with you<br> and hitch up the wagon.<br> You're very kind, professor.<br> I've been walking.<br> -In this rain?<br> -Yes.<br> In this rain.<br> I wonder if you'd mind doing<br> something for me, Stephen.<br> What?<br> Nurse Barker is leaving us.<br> And as long as<br> you're already rather wet...<br> ...perhaps you wouldn't mind<br> hitching up the wagon for her.<br> Everybody's leaving<br> the old homestead.<br> Like a holiday.<br> -It'll be a pleasure.<br> -For both of us.<br> -Goodbye, Professor Warren.<br> -Goodbye.<br> Oh, Helen, will you tell Blanche<br> I want to see her in the den?<br> Have you been here long?<br> I was outside with Nurse Barker.<br> I saw the basement door open.<br> Did you come in that way?<br> Helen...<br> ...you must forget<br> everything you've seen here.<br> Let me handle this.<br> Do you understand?<br> Take the candle.<br> Come with me.<br> You don't think I did it.<br> Wait.<br> I think I have a match. Yes.<br> Where could it go?<br> Hey, there it is.<br> Helen!<br> Helen!<br> Let me out of here!<br> Helen!<br> Number, please.<br> Hello.<br> Number, please.<br> Hello. Number, please.<br> Helen.<br> Helen.<br> What on earth are you doing?<br> What's the matter?<br> ''Blanche murdered''?<br> ''Stephen.''<br> Where?<br> I'll take you up<br> to my stepmother's room.<br> You stay there with her.<br> I'll call the constable.<br> Let me take care of things now.<br> You've been through enough.<br> You tried to telephone, didn't you?<br> Well, I'm glad you couldn't.<br> You looked in this mirror<br> once before today.<br> I watched you.<br> You had no mouth then.<br> Just as you have none now.<br> Look at yourself.<br> Look.<br> And there's no room<br> in the whole world...<br> ...for imperfection.<br> The only person<br> who could have prevented you...<br> ...from achieving<br> the quiet that I can give you...<br> ...was Stephen.<br> And you locked him up...<br> ...downstairs.<br> We're quiet now, Helen.<br> I'm glad I waited.<br> Everyone's out of the way.<br> Mrs. Oates is drunk...<br> ...because I purposely<br> let her steal a bottle of brandy.<br> And Oates...<br> ...he's gone to look for ether...<br> ...because I made sure<br> there was no ether.<br> And Blanche...<br> ...whom I loved...<br> ...didn't love me...<br> ...so she had to die.<br> She's dead and at peace.<br> And Stephen...<br> ...you took care of him for me.<br> Stephen is weak...<br> ...as I once was.<br> What a pity my father didn't live<br> to see me become strong.<br> To see me dispose<br> of the weak and imperfects...<br> ...of the world, whom he detested.<br> He would have admired me<br> for what I'm going to do.<br> -Who is it?<br> -It's me, the constable.<br> I met Dr. Parry in town.<br> He said he won't be<br> able to pick Helen up tonight.<br> The boy is very sick,<br> and he has to stay there.<br> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<br> I'll tell her, constable.<br> Well, I'll be on my way then.<br> Good night.<br> Helen!<br> Helen!<br> Helen!<br> Helen!<br> Helen!<br> Murderer.<br> Helen!<br> You killed them.<br> You killed them all.<br> The servant girl in the well.<br> The others in the town.<br> Today, the cripple in the hotel.<br> You killed them all.<br> Tonight, it would have been Helen.<br> I heard you.<br> Stephen.<br> Get me Stephen.<br> Now it's been done.<br> Ten years too late.<br> No.<br> Forgive me, Stephen.<br> I thought it was you.<br> He always waited<br> till you came home...<br> ...so I thought it was you.<br> A doctor. Get Dr. Parry. Hurry!<br> One...<br> ...eight...<br> ...nine.<br> Dr. Parry.<br> Come.<br> It's I, Helen.<br>
