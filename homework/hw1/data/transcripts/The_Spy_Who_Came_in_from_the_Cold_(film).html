                        Coffee, sir.<br> Why don't you go back and sleep,<br> Mr. Leamas?<br> We'll ring you if he should show up.<br> Maybe he'll come some other time.<br> We can have the police contact you.<br> You can be back here in 20 minutes.<br> You can't wait forever, sir.<br> He'll come with the workmen.<br> He'll come with the night crowd.<br> He'll come.<br> That's what you said last night.<br> Agents are not airplanes, you know.<br> They don't have schedules.<br> Didn't they teach you that in the C.I.A?<br> He's on the run.<br> Mundt is after him at this moment.<br> Let him choose his own time.<br> Mundt may have caught him<br> like he's caught all the others.<br> Riemeck's not like the others.<br> You need some sleep, sir.<br> Look, if you want to go, go.<br> You've been very good.<br> I'll tell the Agency you've been damn good.<br> I'll be around.<br> - What's wrong? Why are the Vopos so close?<br> - I don't know.<br> What are your orders for giving covering<br> fire to protect a man - a man on the run?<br> If they shoot into the West,<br> we shoot back. That's all.<br> We cannot give covering fire.<br> That's the truth.<br> They tell us there would be war if we did.<br> I've got a man coming over tonight.<br> Here? At this crossing point?<br> It'd mean a great deal<br> if we could get him out.<br> There are still places<br> where you can climb.<br> Not that kind. He...<br> He'll bluff his way through. He's got<br> papers, if the papers are any good.<br> A man with a bicycle.<br> Halt!<br> Halt! Halt!<br> Why has Control called me back?<br> Control's pretty vexed<br> about Mundt liquidating Riemeck.<br> Then why doesn't he have the sense<br> to let his station head stay in Berlin...<br> and arrange for somebody<br> to liquidate Mundt?<br> - Pawson.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - What section are you in?<br> - Personnel.<br> - Do you like it?<br> - Fascinating.<br> You get to know everybody's fate.<br> - What's mine?<br> - Better let Control tell you that.<br> It's not my job.<br> But you do know, of course.<br> Thank you.<br> Leamas.<br> Control.<br> Coat.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, do sit down.<br> You must be tired.<br> Ginnie's away, I'm afraid.<br> And this new girl...<br> she never warms the pot.<br> She's called Patrice. Imagine.<br> - It used to be two lumps.<br> - It still is.<br> And, of course no milk.<br> No milk.<br> Simply maddening, isn't it?<br> One wonders how they catch them all.<br> Landsor...<br> Salamon. Now Karl Riemeck.<br> Such a pity we lost him.<br> - Would you like a drink?<br> - I'll wait.<br> Can you still do that?<br> I wonder whether<br> you're tired, burnt out.<br> Well, that's a phenomenon<br> we understand here.<br> It's like metal fatigue.<br> We have to live without sympathy, don't we?<br> We can't do that forever.<br> One can't stay out-of-doors all the time.<br> One needs to come in.<br> In from the cold.<br> I'm an operator, Control.<br> Just an operator.<br> There's a vacancy in Banking Section<br> which might suit you.<br> Sorry. I'm an operational man.<br> I'll take my pension.<br> I don't want a desk job.<br> - You don't know what's on the desk.<br> - Paper.<br> I want you to...<br> to stay out in the cold...<br> a little longer.<br> Please, do sit down.<br> Our work, as I understand it...<br> is based on a single assumption that the<br> West is never going to be the aggressor.<br> Thus...<br> we do disagreeable things...<br> but we're defensive.<br> Our policies are peaceful...<br> but our methods can't afford to be<br> less ruthless than those of the opposition.<br> Can they?<br> You know, I'd say...<br> since the war, our methods...<br> our techniques, that is...<br> and those of the Communists,<br> have become very much the same.<br> Yes.<br> I mean, occasionally...<br> we have to do wicked things.<br> Very wicked things indeed.<br> But you can't be less wicked...<br> than your enemies simply because<br> your government's policy is benevolent.<br> Can you?<br> What I have in mind for Mundt...<br> is a little out of the ordinary.<br> - You haven't met him, have you?<br> - Mundt? No.<br> Oh, well, he was here in '59.<br> He was posing as a member<br> of the East German Steel Mission.<br> That was in Berlin.<br> And...<br> how do you feel about him?<br> - Feel?<br> - Yes.<br> He's a bastard.<br> Quite.<br> Robert Jones.<br> Smith.<br> Roberts.<br> T. Roberts.<br> Leamas. Alec Leamas.<br> John Wilson.<br> Leamas.<br> Last time and the time before<br> I was seen by a Mr. Melrose.<br> My name's Pitt.<br> Melrose has flu.<br> Not much of a stayer, are you?<br> - The jobs weren't exactly the kind of job...<br> - Mr. Leamas...<br> fluent German isn't much use...<br> even in an experienced<br> sales representative...<br> who's frequently<br> speechless by lunchtime.<br> Vacancies for male nurses<br> at Battersea General.<br> Think I'd do better as a patient.<br> Here's one where<br> your languages might help.<br> Blantyre Institute of Psychical Research<br> in Candahar Road.<br> Five minutes on an 11 bus.<br> They want another assistant.<br> The librarian's a Miss Crail.<br> Well, I should gargle, Mama.<br> Yes. Yes, I know.<br> There's a lot of it about.<br> Yes.<br> Yes. Yes. Good-bye, Mama.<br> Can I help you?<br> My name is Leamas.<br> I was sent from the Labor Exchange<br> by a Mr. Pitt as a possible new assistant.<br> You have your qualification form?<br> Yeah.<br> - You've used a card index?<br> - Now and then.<br> - Is your handwriting legible?<br> - Except at weekends.<br> Our books used to be shelved<br> and indexed under titles and authors.<br> But now Brigadier Blantyre<br> wants them rearranged...<br> and additionally indexed<br> under subjects...<br> with cross-references<br> to authors and titles.<br> Thus...<br> Phantasms of the Living<br> by Gurney, Myers and Podmore...<br> had already been title-indexed<br> under "P" for "phantasms"...<br> and author-indexed under<br> "G" for Gurney, "M" for Myers...<br> "P" for Podmore.<br> Precisely.<br> Now it must also be subject-indexed<br> under "A" for "apparitions."<br> - Have you understood that?<br> - They told me the job pays 11.10 a week.<br> Excuse me.<br> Yes, Mama.<br> Would you like to share my sandwiches?<br> - Wouldn't dream of it.<br> - Something called "Savoury Spread."<br> I still wouldn't dream of it.<br> - There isn't a caf for miles.<br> - Any pubs?<br> - Yes, but you can't get lunch in any of them.<br> - I'll be okay.<br> Thank you.<br> Bloody night, Mr. Patmore.<br> - Bloody dirty, Mr. Leamas.<br> - Loaf of bread.<br> And a tin of this corn beef.<br> Let me have some marmalade.<br> And a tin of tomato soup.<br> That'll be...<br> Four and six, sir.<br> Shove it on the bill, Mr. Patmore.<br> Sorry, Mr. Leamas.<br> I told you last week.<br> If you want a proper credit account...<br> you need a banker's reference.<br> You'll get your cash on Friday.<br> You can have the goods on Friday.<br> I've got a job.<br> Very well, sir.<br> - Miss Perry.<br> - Yes, Mr. Leamas?<br> Montague Summers's The Werewolf...<br> where would I...<br> Under "metamorphoses."<br> It's...<br> It's in the subsection on lycanthropy.<br> - On what?<br> - Lycanthropy.<br> A lycanthrope is a man<br> who's been transformed into a wolf.<br> Seems popular.<br> Quite a lot of people have taken it out.<br> They're all little Mr. Beamish.<br> He takes it out about once a month.<br> At the full moon?<br> What do you do on payday, Alec?<br> Do?<br> Do you visit friends...<br> go to the cinema?<br> - No.<br> - Go out to dinner?<br> - No.<br> - Where do you eat then? At home?<br> I suppose so.<br> - Good night.<br> - Like to have dinner at my place?<br> I've got a bottle of wine<br> left over from Christmas.<br> Could I contribute half a bottle of scotch?<br> I keep one at home.<br> For medicinal purposes.<br> Candles were new, weren't they?<br> They just hadn't been used before.<br> Come have a coffee and whisky.<br> You know, Nan,<br> you really shouldn't have.<br> You know, whisky's very...<br> very expensive.<br> - Sugar?<br> - Two lumps.<br> Your fingers will be all right.<br> And no milk.<br> Is the soda medicinal too?<br> - You're very observant.<br> - I've had to be.<br> - Why?<br> - Well, I was a scoutmaster.<br> I don't believe it.<br> You sometimes have the look of a dedicated<br> man, not to that particular cause.<br> - Me, dedicated?<br> - Well...<br> What do you believe in?<br> Well, don't laugh. Tell me.<br> Well, I believe that a Number 11 bus<br> will get me to Hammersmith.<br> I do not believe it will be driven<br> by Father Christmas.<br> That's not a cause.<br> What would you like me to believe in?<br> Peter Pan? Or God?<br> Oh, no. Of course not.<br> I don't believe in God either.<br> What do you believe in?<br> Me?<br> History.<br> Partly. Partly freedom. Partly...<br> Oh, Nan.<br> Don't tell me you're a...<br> you're a bloody Communist.<br> Yes.<br> That's me.<br> Fighting for peace.<br> Well, other people just talk.<br> The Party's going to do something.<br> What, may I ask,<br> will the Party do for comrade Nan?<br> I was once driving down<br> a main road in...<br> on-on the Continent...<br> and I saw two great trucks...<br> move out and converge on a...<br> station wagon driving down<br> the middle of the road.<br> I only heard the crash<br> because I drove on.<br> The last I saw of the station wagon<br> was three small children...<br> two little boys and a little girl...<br> laughing through...<br> through the back window.<br> I...<br> Communism. Capitalism.<br> It's the innocents who get slaughtered.<br> Compassion is not enough.<br> Nobody wants that.<br> Well, it... it's got to be organized,<br> disciplined, to be of any use.<br> Well, that's what the Party<br> does for us. Don't you see?<br> - It organizes our emotions.<br> - Oh, Nan.<br> - You're too proud for that, aren't you?<br> - Nan...<br> Don't let's argue, Alec.<br> This evening was meant to please you.<br> Oh, it did.<br> It did.<br> Well...<br> thank you for my stew and my...<br> coffee and my wine<br> and my medicinal whisky.<br> Good night, Nan.<br> And half a pound of Parmesan.<br> Anything more, Mrs. Zanfrello?<br> - Will be all, thank you.<br> - That'll be, two, five, two, seven.<br> Seven and seven.<br> Cash or credit?<br> - Please, to credit.<br> - Right.<br> Let me have...<br> Let me have a tin of that caviar.<br> Well, it's only mock, Mr. Leamas.<br> It's Norwegian.<br> I prefer it mock.<br> Let me have a tin of the...<br> California cling peaches.<br> - Large or small?<br> - Large. I've got to keep my strength up.<br> And...<br> a pound of butter.<br> And let me have<br> some of this scampi.<br> Italian. Is very nice.<br> Madam, I'll thank you not to insult<br> the hot blood of Irish prawns...<br> taken from the Bay of Dublin herself.<br> Marcella.<br> Right. That'll be 19 and nine, please, sir.<br> Cash or credit?<br> Beg your pardon, sir?<br> Cash or credit?<br> Well, you said Friday, Mr. Leamas.<br> Cash, please.<br> If a bloody Italian can have credit,<br> why can't a bloody Irishman?<br> Now, there's no need for talk like that.<br> Put that phone down.<br> Put that phone down!<br> Marcella, call the police.<br> S.<br> I brought you some sandwiches.<br> You shouldn't have come, Nan.<br> What'll Miss Crail think, consorting with<br> an ex-convict during the library's time?<br> It's 8:15. I'll catch the next<br> Number 7 and she'll never know.<br> - What'll you do, Alec?<br> - Go for a walk, have a bit of a think...<br> avoid the pubs,<br> visit the Labor Exchange...<br> - collect my suitcase from the caretaker...<br> - I've collected it.<br> It's at my flat<br> till you find somewhere decent.<br> - Nan, I...<br> - Dinner will be served at 8:00...<br> with a Portuguese wine spelt D-A-O...<br> with a twiddle over the "A"<br> and pronounced "dang."<br> - "Dang."<br> - I made Hungarian goulash.<br> Well, I thought it'd be tactful to serve<br> a Communist dish with a totalitarian wine.<br> What's in the parcel, Alec?<br> - Oh, my pajamas.<br> - Good.<br> Do you like birds?<br> The ones with the white collars are wild,<br> and the others are domesticated.<br> With people it's the other way round.<br> Bird-watching's one of my hobbies.<br> I often come here.<br> Do you also often come to Wormwood Scrubs<br> Prison at 8:00 in the morning to watch birds?<br> Yes. Jailbirds.<br> - They're my other hobby.<br> - Only the young ones, surely.<br> That's not quite fair.<br> I'm a member of a charitable discharged<br> prisoners' aid society called the Link.<br> My card.<br> Why pick on me, Mr. Ashe?<br> Because the governor said<br> that you'd refused prisoners' aid...<br> and you wouldn't<br> even see a probation officer.<br> Now, that's proud and stupid.<br> So I followed you.<br> And what sort of aid does your charitable<br> organization dispense, Mr. Ashe?<br> We try and find<br> your professional qualifications.<br> Half a bottle of whisky a day,<br> or is that a disqualification?<br> Then introduce you<br> to other members of the Link...<br> who might find you a job.<br> Officially, we're allowed to offer you<br> five pounds out of society's funds...<br> to tide you over the first few days.<br> And...<br> unofficially,<br> we're allowed to offer you lunch.<br> - More retsina?<br> - I don't see why not.<br> I've nothing to be clearheaded for.<br> But you will have,<br> if only you'll stop being obstinate...<br> and let me introduce you to this<br> great friend of mine, Dick Carlton.<br> Yeah. All right. All right.<br> But I keep on telling you, I can't write...<br> except business reports.<br> And I keep on telling you,<br> you don't have to write.<br> His agency's always on the lookout<br> for German background material.<br> Political, economic, social.<br> Even tourist stuff.<br> He services the holiday magazines too.<br> Now, you, with your...<br> business experience of Berlin...<br> provide the facts, the opinions.<br> His chaps will do all the writing.<br> As a matter of fact, I'm...<br> I'm meeting him myself this evening<br> at a club in Dean Street...<br> called the Pussy Willow,<br> - Care to join us?<br> - No, sorry. Sorry. No. I have a date.<br> Just drop in for a quick one.<br> You might do yourself a bit of good.<br> Anyway, I'll bring a check for five quid<br> from the Link to tide you over.<br> A check?<br> I'll bring cash.<br> Pussy Willow. Dean Street.<br> - Okay.<br> - Well, I have to go now.<br> Finish your wine.<br> Ciao, then.<br> Thanks for the...<br> We haven't met.<br> My name's Smiley. I live here.<br> So they've made contact.<br> A man called Ashe.<br> The way you beat up that grocer<br> was masterly, Alec.<br> Two small paragraphs down the page<br> in the West London Observer.<br> But it was enough.<br> A shark can smell blood<br> a mile off when he's hungry...<br> and Mundt<br> is hungry for our blood.<br> Name me a counterespionage head<br> who isn't hungry...<br> for one high-grade, defecting spy.<br> So I'm to defect.<br> Yes, I wanted you to build up<br> the portrait of a man...<br> whom inaction and embitterment<br> had driven to drink...<br> but not yet to actual treachery.<br> Don't change the portrait<br> by a brushstroke, Alec.<br> Just continue to be embittered.<br> Continue to drink.<br> Drink, but never be too drunk to think.<br> Smiley, give Leamas whisky and soda.<br> What am I to think about?<br> You're to think about the evidence<br> we've cooked up to incriminate Mundt.<br> To incriminate him so lethally...<br> that his own second-in-command...<br> will arrest him and have him shot.<br> Yes, we've been cooking<br> for a long time, Alec...<br> with a great many ingredients<br> and a great many pots.<br> Remember those two trips<br> you made for us from Berlin...<br> to Copenhagen and Helsinki?<br> Operation Rolling Stone.<br> Precisely.<br> That was one of the ingredients.<br> They'll interrogate you, of course...<br> and, bit by bit...<br> you'll come across with the evidence<br> that'll kill Mundt.<br> Just feed them a stray fact here<br> and a stray fact there.<br> Let them piece the clues<br> and the facts together...<br> into the story<br> we want them to believe.<br> Yes. There's a man called Fiedler.<br> - Mundt's second-in-command.<br> - Fiedler, my dear Alec...<br> is the linchpin of our plan.<br> Fiedler's the only man who's a match<br> for Mundt, and...<br> he hates his guts.<br> Fiedler's a Jew, of course,<br> and Mundt's quite the other thing.<br> Believe me, my dear Alec...<br> Fiedler...<br> is the acolyte who one day<br> will stab the high priest in the back.<br> And...<br> Rolling Stone will provide him<br> with the dagger point.<br> Yes.<br> And by the way...<br> Is there anything we can do<br> while you're away for that...<br> girlfriend of yours...<br> Miss Perry?<br> You know, I mean money or anything.<br> Only when it's over.<br> Then I'll take care of it myself.<br> Quite.<br> To do anything now<br> would be very insecure.<br> Very insecure.<br> Well, I just don't want her<br> to be implicated.<br> - I promise not to.<br> - I don't want her to have a file or anything.<br> - I promise that too.<br> - I want her left out of it.<br> I want her forgotten.<br> She shall be.<br> And I think, until this thing is over,<br> you should forget her too.<br> Go and meet Ashe's friend.<br> Go and meet Carlton.<br> And after Carlton...<br> whom?<br> We don't know, do we?<br> This party's on the Link, charitable<br> society for the rehabilitation...<br> of discharged prisoners.<br> Bring us a bottle of scotch<br> and keep the change, if any.<br> Now, perhaps you'll tell me<br> what the bloody hell's going on.<br> - Don't know what you mean.<br> - You followed me from prison...<br> when I was released with some<br> cock-and-bull story about prisoners' aid.<br> You bought me<br> an expensive meal and...<br> gave me a fiver for services<br> which I didn't render.<br> - I was only trying...<br> - I know what you were trying, and don't bloody well interrupt.<br> Just wait until I've finished.<br> Do you mind?<br> You're used to waiting, aren't you?<br> On street corners.<br> Look here, Leamas. Ever since I tried to<br> help you, you've done nothing but insult me.<br> Drop it.<br> I only want to make it crystal clear<br> that although I'm prepared...<br> to accept insults from him in private,<br> I - I'm not prepared to be insulted...<br> in front of somebody<br> I admire and respect and...<br> Get out.<br> Okay, Dick.<br> If that's what you want.<br> Now perhaps you'll tell me<br> why you had that queer pick me up.<br> By all means. I told him to.<br> Why?<br> As a fellow member of the Link,<br> I'm interested in you.<br> I want to make you a proposition.<br> A journalistic proposition.<br> Journalistic. I see.<br> I run an agency...<br> an international feature service.<br> It pays well.<br> Very well for interesting material.<br> - Who publishes the material?<br> - International clients.<br> I have a correspondent in Paris<br> who disposes of a good deal of the stuff.<br> Often I don't even know<br> who does publish, I confess.<br> I don't awfully care.<br> They pay promptly.<br> And they're happy to pay into<br> Swiss or Scandinavian banks...<br> for instance, where nobody seems to<br> bother very much about things like tax.<br> They'd even make the check payable<br> to your pen name, if you had one.<br> They'd have to pay a hell of a lot.<br> They're offering a down payment<br> of 15,000.<br> The money's already lodged<br> in the Banque Cantonale de Berne.<br> On the production of suitable identification,<br> with which my clients will provide you...<br> you can draw the money.<br> And my clients will assist you with any...<br> resettlement problems that may arise.<br> - How soon would you want an answer?<br> - Now.<br> Of course, you're not expected to commit<br> all your reminiscences to paper.<br> You'll meet my client, and he'll arrange<br> to have the material ghostwritten.<br> Where would I meet him?<br> We fly to the Hague<br> tomorrow morning at 9:45.<br> I'll drive you anywhere<br> you have to go to pack.<br> No, you won't.<br> Leamas, at this stage,<br> I can't afford to turn you loose on London.<br> - I'm afraid you'll have to.<br> - Why?<br> Well, I,<br> I don't want the girl implicated.<br> Do you have to see her?<br> Well, she - she has my suitcase.<br> We'd prefer to pick it up ourselves.<br> You can prefer what you like.<br> I didn't ask you how many lumps<br> because I remembered.<br> I didn't ask why you came<br> my goulash had turned solid...<br> because you came.<br> There's only one thing<br> I really want to know, Alec.<br> What?<br> Whatever happened to your pajamas?<br> They should be in Gravesend by now.<br> I threw them into the Thames.<br> Have you come into money?<br> Well, buying a whole bottle of whisky<br> instead of your usual half and...<br> well, flinging your pajamas in the river.<br> I have another pair in my suitcase.<br> Chocolate brown with white piping.<br> Like a cake.<br> And not tasting of prison.<br> No.<br> Was it - Was it awful?<br> No. No.<br> Just ridiculous.<br> Why do they have to have disinfectant...<br> that smells even worse than the stuff<br> they're supposed to disinfect?<br> And why do they give you back<br> your personal belongings...<br> as if they'd been sanctified<br> by the archbishop of Canterbury?<br> With this ring, I do thee wed.<br> With this brown paper parcel...<br> I return thee to society.<br> They returned you to me.<br> I'm very grateful.<br> So grateful I cut tonight's<br> Party meeting.<br> Well, thank you<br> for putting me above history.<br> - Whisky or Do?<br> - Do.<br> I have to go away early tomo...<br> tomorrow morning.<br> I could tell.<br> I'll be back.<br> Thank you.<br> How long are you staying in Holland,<br> Mr. Thwaite?<br> About two weeks,<br> until the conference finishes.<br> You know your passport lapses in 18 days?<br> I'll be back.<br> - Bitte.<br> - Thank you.<br> Welcome, Leamas.<br> You had a good voyage?<br> - It was all right.<br> - Thank you, Carlton. You can take the car.<br> - How about you?<br> - Just coffee.<br> Is it always just coffee?<br> What are you anyway?<br> Who are you?<br> What's your name?<br> I'm a professional man.<br> All right.<br> They've sent a professional. Fine.<br> So we can cut out<br> the tricks and games.<br> We both know our job.<br> You've got a paid defector on your hands.<br> That's me.<br> Date of birth?<br> August the 25th, 1924.<br> In Sawley, Derbyshire.<br> Sawley, Derbyshire.<br> Parents?<br> Ronald Arthur, born 1901.<br> Kathleen Olive,<br> maiden name Cantley...<br> born in Ireland, 1905.<br> You're unmarried?<br> Yes.<br> What was the date and method<br> of your recruitment?<br> The War Office advertised for linguists.<br> I applied.<br> First appointment.<br> Yes.<br> Banking section.<br> That's where I began.<br> That's where I ended.<br> Bastards.<br> So you came back from Berlin,<br> and they put you in Banking.<br> What were your duties?<br> Signing checks for other people.<br> Concealed payments. Paper.<br> What were your exact duties?<br> Paying agents.<br> A letter would come from Finance.<br> "The payment of 5,000 Swiss francs...<br> to such and such an agent<br> is authorized by so-and-so."<br> So I'd sign the check<br> or get the bank to make a transfer.<br> - Which bank?<br> - Blatt and Rodney.<br> A chichi little bank in the city.<br> There's a theory in the service<br> that Etonians are discreet.<br> So you knew the names<br> of British agents all over the world?<br> No, I signed a blank check.<br> The name of the payee was secret.<br> Who knew then?<br> Who kept the names?<br> Special Dispatch. They added<br> the name and mailed the check.<br> So you just provided a signature.<br> A false signature.<br> After 18 years in the service,<br> my sole contribution.<br> Did you make regular payments<br> from Banking Section?<br> Rolling Stone. That was all.<br> Quarterly.<br> Rolling Stone.<br> - What did that involve?<br> - Opening accounts at two foreign banks.<br> Where? On what dates?<br> Copenhagen, the second week in April.<br> The 12th, I think. Yes, the 12th.<br> - Where else?<br> - Helsinki.<br> That was earlier - February the 29th.<br> - What kind of money?<br> - It was big. Very big.<br> $50,000 to Copenhagen...<br> to Helsinki.<br> - You opened the accounts in false names?<br> - Yes.<br> And you called the operation Rolling Stone.<br> That was a cover name?<br> Yes.<br> If it was a clandestine payment, why did<br> it have to have a cover name as well?<br> - Orders.<br> - Whose orders?<br> Control.<br> He chose the cover name.<br> Shall we continue indoors?<br> You want to write it down, don't you?<br> Don't know what you're looking for.<br> Scratching around in the dust.<br> I'll start again.<br> One. Leamas crosses Danish border<br> on his own passport.<br> Two. Leamas collects cash<br> from innocent bank.<br> Three. Leamas goes to second bank...<br> with a false passport<br> under the name of Woolrych.<br> Four. Leamas opens joint account, same as<br> married couple does, in two false names.<br> One was my own alias, Woolrych.<br> The other was the alias of my partner.<br> Your partner was in this case the agent<br> who would later collect the money.<br> - Brilliant.<br> - What was the agent's alias?<br> - Werner Ziebold.<br> - Werner...<br> Ziebold.<br> How did you get a specimen<br> of Ziebold's signature?<br> Special Dispatch gave it to me.<br> All right. Go on, please.<br> Nothing to go on about.<br> That was it.<br> The joint account was opened.<br> Only two people could draw on it.<br> And within a week or two, no doubt...<br> the mysterious Mr. Ziebold<br> went to the bank and drew his money.<br> I never knew when.<br> I never knew why.<br> I never damn well cared.<br> By that time I hated the lot of them...<br> Control, those damned old pussycats<br> chewing their wine gums.<br> - I hated...<br> - Come in.<br> Excuse me, Herr Peters.<br> This came by special messenger.<br> Thank you.<br> They're looking for you in England.<br> They don't say anything.<br> They just want you.<br> You're missing,<br> and the police want information.<br> I shall have to make a telephone call.<br> Wait here.<br> We have to leave.<br> Holland is not safe for you anymore.<br> We have to go at once.<br> The discussion will be continued later.<br> What do you mean go?<br> - Go where?<br> - East. Where else?<br> My passport lapses in 18 days.<br> Your passport<br> is an embarrassment already.<br> You did it, didn't you?<br> Your people leaked it in London.<br> You want to get me out of Holland<br> in some cozy workers' paradise...<br> where you can keep me<br> safe and warm.<br> I don't want that. Give me my money.<br> I'll go now. Just give me my money!<br> You have not yet earned the money.<br> Besides, if you go now,<br> you will be caught within 48 hours.<br> So precisely what do you propose<br> to do about it?<br> - Yes?<br> - Miss Perry?<br> - Yes.<br> - My name is Smiley.<br> I'm a friend of Alec Leamas.<br> A close friend.<br> We worked for the same firm in Berlin.<br> Here's my business card.<br> I assure you I'm quite respectable.<br> - You mean you want to come in?<br> - Please, if it's not too late.<br> No.<br> Tired?<br> - Aren't you?<br> - No.<br> I didn't have any drink with my supper.<br> I didn't have any supper with my drink.<br> - Will they start in on me right away?<br> - I don't know.<br> If they have any sense,<br> they will wait until your head is clearer.<br> - Who will I see?<br> - Fiedler.<br> Fiedler.<br> Whose room is that? Fiedler's?<br> No. He is in the east wing.<br> Very appropriate.<br> When will he come?<br> In his own time.<br> Do you think he's good at his job?<br> For a Jew.<br> You're tired.<br> We'll talk in the morning.<br> You will be wakened at 6:00. Please be<br> ready at 7:00. We can't waste time.<br> You have the transcript<br> of his first interrogation?<br> Yes.<br> It's still locked.<br> They are Mundt's quarters.<br> He's away for a while.<br> - When will he be back?<br> - In a while.<br> - Doesn't tell you much, does he?<br> - He tells me what he needs to.<br> Mundt was a Nazi, wasn't he?<br> He was a member of the Hitler Youth...<br> as a boy.<br> Now he's a grown-up Communist.<br> He's what I would call...<br> available.<br> Like you. Shall we begin?<br> Let me start by asking you<br> an amusing question.<br> Let me start by asking you one.<br> Make you laugh your head off.<br> Where's my money? When can I go<br> wherever - wherever home is?<br> Carlton's gone home, Peters has gone home.<br> What about me?<br> - The agreement was...<br> - Agreement? You've broken the bloody agreement.<br> And, barring miracles,<br> you've broken my bloody neck too.<br> The agreement was that I should be<br> interrogated for two weeks in Holland, paid...<br> and allowed to slip quietly back to England<br> without anyone knowing I'd ever been away.<br> And nobody would have known<br> if you hadn't broken the story.<br> Just who the hell<br> do you think you are?<br> How dare you come stamping in here<br> like Napolon, ordering me about!<br> You are a traitor. Does it occur to you?<br> A wanted, spent, dishonest man.<br> The lowest currency<br> of the cold war.<br> We buy you, we sell you,<br> we lose you, we even can shoot you.<br> Not a bird would stir<br> in the trees outside.<br> Not a single peasant<br> would turn his head to see what fell.<br> Besides, we didn't tell London.<br> We were thinking of using you again<br> so we didn't tell them. You're wrong.<br> As for the money, you'll get it<br> when you've given us the information.<br> The better you talk,<br> the sooner we pay.<br> So far your information is useless.<br> Cheap peddler stuff. Nothing.<br> Shall we try a little harder?<br> It's not a question of trying.<br> I told you what I know.<br> Make your own deductions.<br> Very well.<br> Let's make some deductions together.<br> What would you, as an experienced<br> intelligence officer...<br> deduce from the few facts<br> you gave us about Rolling Stone?<br> Then let me offer my conclusion first.<br> Control himself was running an agent.<br> He paid him, christened the operation,<br> personally supervised the case.<br> - Do you consider that fanciful?<br> - It's possible.<br> Anything's possible.<br> Can you deduce the nationality<br> of Control's agent?<br> How could I? How could anybody?<br> Who chose the name Ziebold?<br> Who chose it?<br> - Control.<br> - A German alias, and Control chose it?<br> I wonder why.<br> So what? He could still have been<br> a bloody Tibetan.<br> Oh, come on, Leamas.<br> You don't give a Tibetan<br> a German alias...<br> if you want him to be able<br> to visit a bank inconspicuously...<br> and draw out large sums of money!<br> You give a German alias to a German.<br> And what kind of German?<br> If Control ran him, an East German.<br> And if Control ran him...<br> somebody very, very big.<br> Do you see what I'm after?<br> Yes.<br> Your last agent was Riemeck.<br> Karl Riemeck.<br> - I never had a chance to interrogate him.<br> - Mundt shot him.<br> How did you first approach Riemeck?<br> - We didn't. He approached us.<br> - Offering what?<br> Offering a roll of microfilm<br> which, when we developed it...<br> turned out to contain photographs<br> of the minutes of a weekly meeting...<br> held by the Praesidium<br> of the East German Communist Party.<br> After that the information got better<br> and better. Never handled stuff like it.<br> Did it ever occur to you to ask him<br> how he got his information?<br> Why the hell should I?<br> He worked in the Praesidium.<br> - Did Control ever ask you how you got it?<br> - No.<br> - Did Control meet Riemeck?<br> - Yes, once.<br> I was against it for simple<br> security reasons, but yes, he did.<br> Control came to Berlin last spring.<br> He asked to meet Riemeck to...<br> to thank him.<br> Were you present at the... thanksgiving?<br> - Of course I was. I introduced them.<br> - But were you present all the time?<br> No. I introduced them,<br> and then I left.<br> Control insisted on that?<br> He wanted to be alone with Riemeck?<br> Yes. Suppose it gave him a kick.<br> - How long were they alone?<br> - Five minutes, 10 minutes.<br> What are you trying to prove?<br> I'm not at the proving stage.<br> You're going down a blind alley, Fiedler.<br> You forget I ran the Berlin station.<br> I ran all the agents<br> in East Germany.<br> If Rolling Stone had been an East German<br> agent, I'd have known about it.<br> He couldn't function any other way.<br> You're wasting your time.<br> I ran all the agents<br> in East Germany.<br> Karl Riemeck was the last.<br> Would you like some fresh air?<br> - What are you going to do with the money?<br> - I don't know.<br> Settle down in<br> some sunny spot on the Caspian...<br> with one of your<br> flaxen-haired discus throwers.<br> I can't go home.<br> - Don't you mind giving up your country?<br> - What the hell's my country done for me?<br> I worked for the service for 18 years and they<br> kicked me out as if it had been 18 minutes.<br> - Why did you work for them?<br> - Well, the money.<br> - Only money?<br> - It was a job.<br> You would have done it anywhere,<br> for anyone?<br> I'm a technician, Fiedler.<br> Just a technician.<br> - But not a Communist technician.<br> - Oh, for God's sake.<br> - A Christian, then.<br> - I don't believe in Father Christmas.<br> I don't believe in God or Karl Marx.<br> I don't believe in anything<br> that rocks the world.<br> But how do you sleep?<br> You have to have a philosophy.<br> I reserve the right to be ignorant.<br> That's the Western way of life.<br> I couldn't have put it better myself.<br> You think ignorance<br> a valuable contribution to world knowledge.<br> - You fight for ignorance.<br> - Go to hell.<br> Look, all I want to know is why.<br> What's the motor?<br> As a matter of fact, I invented the<br> combustion engine and the two-way nappy.<br> I'm a hero of the Soviet Union.<br> I wear the Order of Lenin on my rump.<br> I'm a man, you fool.<br> Don't you understand?<br> A plain, simple, muddled,<br> fat-headed human being.<br> We have them in the West, you know.<br> That's what it's all about.<br> Is that why you became a spy?<br> Look, your job and mine<br> permit us to take human life.<br> If I want to kill you and I can only do it<br> by putting a bomb in a restaurant...<br> then that's the way I'll kill you...<br> that's what I'll do.<br> Innocent people die every day.<br> They might as well do so for a reason.<br> Afterwards I may draw up<br> a purely academic balance...<br> and an advance of three yards.<br> What about you?<br> If ever I have to break your neck,<br> I promise to do it with a minimum of force.<br> - Now, when do I get my bloody money?<br> - Look, I could lie to you.<br> I could say you get your money in a month<br> just to keep you sweet.<br> But I'm telling you I don't know,<br> and that's the truth.<br> You have given us indications.<br> Until we have run them to earth<br> I can't think of letting you go.<br> But afterwards,<br> if things are as I think they are...<br> you'll need a friend.<br> You're bustling about bloody early.<br> Is Mundt back?<br> I want you to sign something.<br> The courier's waiting.<br> Letters to the banks<br> in Copenhagen and Helsinki...<br> asking for a statement of any recent<br> withdrawals by your two partners.<br> The letters will be mailed<br> from Switzerland.<br> Where will the bank<br> send the statements?<br> To one of our accommodation addresses<br> in West Berlin.<br> Control will find out that I've written.<br> He'll have forgotten<br> by the time you next meet.<br> Will you sign with your aliases, please?<br> Let me have the pad.<br> Here you are.<br> The Copenhagen letter.<br> The Helsinki one's easier.<br> I wrote it in my own handwriting.<br> Now what?<br> Within a week<br> we should at least know the dates...<br> when Rolling Stone was last in Copenhagen<br> and Helsinki to draw the money.<br> Is Mundt back?<br> Not yet.<br> Until we hear from the banks<br> there's nothing more we can do.<br> We shall be constantly<br> in one another's company.<br> If that's distasteful to you<br> I apologize.<br> I thought we could go for walks again...<br> or drive around in the hills for a bit<br> while we talked.<br> Incidentally...<br> we have some facilities here<br> for people who...<br> for people who are spending<br> some time with us.<br> Facilities for diversion and so on.<br> You offering me a woman?<br> I don't need one.<br> You had one in England, didn't you?<br> The girl in the library?<br> Oh, yes, yes. She was a Communist too.<br> She believed in free love.<br> At the time it was all I could afford.<br> - Morning, Mr. Lofthouse.<br> - Good morning, Miss Perry.<br> You're at the J's already.<br> You are settling down quickly.<br> I was so very happy<br> the job fell vacant.<br> We're very happy you applied for it.<br> - Good morning, Miss Crail.<br> - Good morning, Miss Perry.<br> - Miss Crail.<br> - Yes, Miss Perry?<br> Would it be possible<br> for me to take my holiday now?<br> I've been invited<br> to spend a week in Germany.<br> You have friends in Germany?<br> No, not exactly friends. Comrades.<br> You know I'm secretary<br> of the local branch of the Communist...<br> I've never held that against you, Miss Perry.<br> This is a free country.<br> I know.<br> I know, and I'm very grateful.<br> Well, the Party center has arranged<br> a series of exchanges...<br> to promote cultural amity<br> and world peace...<br> and I've been chosen to exchange with<br> the secretary of the Neuenhagen Branch...<br> outside Leipzig.<br> Isn't Leipzig east, behind the curtain?<br> I should very much like to go,<br> Miss Crail.<br> I'll speak to Brigadier Blantyre...<br> but I think I'd better just<br> tell him Germany, not East.<br> He doesn't hold with the Russians.<br> Thank you.<br> Blonde or brunette?<br> - Do you know Mundt?<br> - Well, we have talked about him.<br> He shoots first and asks questions afterward.<br> The deterrent principle.<br> It's an odd system<br> in a profession where the questions...<br> are always supposed to be<br> more important than the shooting.<br> It's an odd system<br> unless you are frightened of the answers.<br> - That telephone call.<br> - Yes? What about it?<br> The money in Copenhagen.<br> The bank answered your letter.<br> The manager's very worried<br> that there has been a mistake.<br> The money was drawn by your partner<br> exactly one week after you paid it in.<br> The date it was drawn coincides<br> with the two-days visit Mundt...<br> paid to Copenhagen in April.<br> The same goes for the bank in Helsinki.<br> Mundt took the money from there too.<br> You're out of your bloody mind. I've told you<br> again and again they couldn't have done it.<br> London couldn't have run him as their man<br> without my knowing about it.<br> You're trying to tell me that Control<br> was personally directing and operating...<br> the head of counterespionage<br> in the Abteilung...<br> without the knowledge<br> of the Berlin station?<br> Well, I'm telling you you're mad!<br> Shut up... and drive us home.<br> You have driven us home, Leamas.<br> Mundt is a traitor.<br> I tell you,<br> they eased his escape from England.<br> London let him go<br> because they wanted him to go.<br> - They found him, bribed him, turned him...<br> - I tell you, they couldn't have done it!<br> Control couldn't have run him<br> without my knowledge. You're mad!<br> Don't tell me<br> you're that sorry to kill Mundt.<br> I suppose you ought to write to the banks<br> and tell them everything is quite in order.<br> - Comrade Fiedler?<br> - Yes?<br> We want to talk to you.<br> What do you want?<br> We are from Berlin.<br> Go to your room.<br> Come in.<br> Close the door.<br> Undo him.<br> Get up.<br> Take him upstairs.<br> Whisky?<br> London sent you, didn't they?<br> Where's Fiedler?<br> Under arrest, as you are...<br> for conspiring to sabotage<br> the security of the people.<br> You'll be a witness at his trial.<br> We shall want your confession.<br> - That means you don't have any proof.<br> - We shall have proof.<br> We shall have your confession.<br> Who sent you?<br> Control? Smiley?<br> No one sent me.<br> They're looking for me, don't you know?<br> When did you last see Smiley?<br> I've never met Smiley.<br> Where did you go after lunch with Ashe?<br> Chelsea?<br> I haven't the vaguest recollection.<br> I had two scotches<br> and half a bottle of punishing Greek wine.<br> All I remember is wandering about...<br> In a taxi.<br> Was I in a taxi?<br> Our man reported you took a taxi<br> outside the restaurant.<br> Where did you go in the taxi?<br> I told you, I... was too drunk to know<br> that I was in a bloody taxi.<br> I mean, if your man followed me,<br> why don't you ask him wh-wh-wh...<br> Did you go to Smiley's house in Chelsea?<br> I don't know S...<br> I don't know Smiley.<br> Why did you shake off your followers?<br> Why were you so keen<br> on shaking them off?<br> Hans Dieter Mundt,<br> I have a warrant for your arrest...<br> by order of the Praesidium<br> of the German Democratic Republic.<br> You all know why we're here.<br> This is not a trial, but a tribunal<br> convened expressly by the Praesidium...<br> and it is to the Praesidium alone<br> that we are responsible.<br> The proceedings,<br> therefore, will be secret.<br> We shall hear evidence<br> as we think fit.<br> Comrade Fiedler, you may begin.<br> You can see from the report<br> I've already given you...<br> that we ourselves<br> sought Leamas out in England...<br> induced him to defect<br> and finally brought him to our republic.<br> Nothing could more clearly demonstrate<br> the impartiality of Leamas than this...<br> that he still refuses,<br> for reasons I will explain...<br> to believe that Mundt<br> is a British agent.<br> It is therefore grotesque<br> to suggest that Leamas is a plant.<br> The initiative was ours...<br> and the fragmentary but vital evidence<br> of Leamas provides only the final proof...<br> in a long chain of indications<br> reaching back over many years.<br> You will see on page seven...<br> that in 1959...<br> Mundt was posted to London...<br> ostensibly as a member<br> of the East German Steel Mission.<br> Actually, he was engaged<br> in intelligence duties.<br> In the course of this,<br> he killed a man.<br> By doing so, he exposed himself<br> to countermeasures...<br> by the British Secret Police.<br> Since he had no diplomatic immunity...<br> for NATO Britain<br> does not recognize our sovereignty...<br> Mundt went into hiding.<br> Ports were watched.<br> His photograph and description were<br> distributed throughout the British Isles.<br> Yet after two days in hiding...<br> Mundt takes a taxi to London Airport<br> and flies to Berlin.<br> Brilliant, you will say,<br> and so it was.<br> With the whole<br> of Britain's police force alerted...<br> her roads, railways, ship and air routes<br> under constant surveillance...<br> Mundt, in British eyes<br> a dangerous political murderer...<br> takes a plane from London Airport<br> and flies to Berlin.<br> Brilliant, indeed.<br> Or perhaps you may feel, comrades,<br> with the advantage of hindsight...<br> that Mundt's escape from Britain<br> was a little too brilliant...<br> a little too easy...<br> that without the connivance<br> of the British authorities...<br> it never could have been<br> possible at all.<br> The truth is this...<br> Mundt was taken prisoner<br> by the British...<br> and released on condition<br> that he become their paid agent.<br> It is beyond all doubt<br> that he was paid through the medium...<br> of the banking operation<br> called Rolling Stone...<br> whose procedure you will see<br> fully described in Annex "A" to the report.<br> Leamas played an unwitting part<br> in this operation.<br> Bring the witness forward, please.<br> - What is your name?<br> - Alec Leamas, assistant librarian.<br> You were formerly employed by<br> the British Secret Service, were you not?<br> Yes.<br> Is it your opinion that they could have<br> recruited Mundt as their agent?<br> - No, it is not.<br> - How can you be so sure?<br> I've told you a dozen times.<br> I'm not a performing seal.<br> I was head of the Berlin section<br> for nine years.<br> If Mundt had been our agent, I'd have known<br> about it. I'd have run him, don't you see?<br> Not to know would be<br> an administrative impossibility.<br> Quite.<br> In 1960 you had, in your capacity<br> as Berlin station head...<br> approached and recruited<br> the late Karl Riemeck...<br> formerly secretary to this Praesidium.<br> He approached me.<br> With microphotographs<br> of secret Praesidium documents?<br> Yes.<br> Was his later work for you<br> equally spectacular?<br> More so. He gave us a complete breakdown<br> of the Abteilung. Control was delighted.<br> Control was so delighted that he actually<br> came over to Berlin to meet Riemeck.<br> - Did you approve of that?<br> - No.<br> Riemeck was my man.<br> Control should have left him to me.<br> That was the rule.<br> Control broke it.<br> You introduced him<br> but were not present at the meeting.<br> - That is correct.<br> - And they were entirely alone?<br> How should I know?<br> I wasn't there.<br> What do you think<br> Control said to Riemeck?<br> Well, he wanted to thank him,<br> so he told me, and give him a medal.<br> Mutual admiration.<br> Can you tell the tribunal<br> how Riemeck obtained his information?<br> I never bothered to ask.<br> Then you may sit down<br> and I will tell them.<br> Who, in 1960...<br> The year after Mundt<br> escaped from England, remember.<br> Who co-opted Riemeck onto the Committee<br> for the Protection of the People...<br> that vital committee which coordinates<br> all of our security measures?<br> Who proposed that Riemeck should be<br> appointed secretary to the Praesidium...<br> with access to all its secrets?<br> Who, at every stage<br> in Riemeck's career since 1960...<br> has singled him out for posts<br> of exceptional responsibility?<br> The same man who was uniquely placed to<br> shield Riemeck in his espionage activities...<br> Hans Dieter Mundt.<br> Mundt, by deliberately raising Riemeck<br> to higher and higher posts...<br> made it possible for him<br> to amass all that information...<br> which he passed on to Leamas.<br> Mundt, Riemeck, Leamas, Control.<br> That was the chain of communication.<br> But Leamas never knew...<br> for it is a rule in intelligence technique<br> the whole world over...<br> that each link of the chain be kept as far<br> as possible in ignorance of the others.<br> Leamas never knew<br> that Mundt was London's man.<br> Then why did Mundt kill Riemeck...<br> if Riemeck and he were both<br> working for the British?<br> He had no alternative.<br> Riemeck was already under our suspicion.<br> If I had been given the chance<br> to interrogate him...<br> I could have incriminated Mundt.<br> But I was not allowed to interrogate him.<br> Mundt shot him.<br> He killed the bird<br> before it could sing.<br> Had it not been for the defection of Leamas,<br> Mundt might be practicing his treachery still.<br> There is your saboteur.<br> There is your terrorist.<br> There's the man who has<br> sold the people's right.<br> When you come looking for<br> your recommendation to the Praesidium...<br> do not shrink from recognizing the...<br> full bestiality<br> of this traitor's crime.<br> For Hans Dieter Mundt, death...<br> is a judgment of mercy.<br> Comrade Karden,<br> you are speaking for Comrade Mundt.<br> You have heard the accusations<br> of Comrade Fiedler.<br> Do you wish to examine<br> the witness Leamas?<br> Yes, I should like to<br> in one moment.<br> One moment.<br> The contention of Comrade Mundt<br> is that Leamas is lying...<br> and that Comrade Fiedler,<br> either by design or ill chance...<br> has been drawn into a plot<br> to disrupt the Abteilung...<br> and thus bring into disrepute the organs<br> for the defense of our people's democracy.<br> We do not dispute<br> that Karl Riemeck was a British spy.<br> There is evidence for that.<br> But we do dispute<br> that Mundt was in league with him...<br> and we dispute that Mundt accepted money<br> for betraying our democracy.<br> For these charges we say<br> that there is no objective evidence...<br> and that Comrade Fiedler<br> is intoxicated by dreams of power...<br> and blinded to rational thought.<br> We maintain that Leamas was dismissed<br> from the British Secret Service...<br> so that he should exhibit those symptoms<br> of physical and moral decline...<br> which would deceive our London agents<br> into thinking he was a potential defector.<br> But we also maintain that once<br> our London agents had contacted him...<br> he was used by Control<br> as a weapon...<br> indeed as a spearhead<br> in Control's plot...<br> to incriminate Comrade Mundt.<br> But Comrade Fiedler, on whose ambitions<br> the British so accurately counted...<br> accepted the evidence as true...<br> and thus became party to a monstrous plot<br> to destroy - to murder, in fact...<br> for Mundt now stands<br> to lose his life...<br> one of the most vigilant defenders<br> of our democratic republic.<br> I said vigilant...<br> comrades.<br> For do you really suppose that all this<br> time Comrade Mundt has been in ignorance...<br> of Fiedler's feverish plotting?<br> It was Mundt who took<br> one crucial precaution...<br> while the British, with Fiedler's aid,<br> planned his murder.<br> He caused scrupulous inquiries to be made<br> about the witness Leamas.<br> He was looking, you see,<br> for one minute human error...<br> in a scheme of almost<br> superhuman subtlety.<br> Now, Mr. Leamas...<br> let us see whether we can assist<br> Comrade Mundt in his search.<br> Do you still refuse to tell us where the<br> taxi took you after your lunch with Ashe?<br> I don't refuse. I don't remember.<br> I was too drunk.<br> - Not too drunk to pay the taxi.<br> - Too drunk to remember.<br> But you paid.<br> I wonder what with.<br> Whatever small change I had in my pocket.<br> I'm like that when I'm drunk.<br> - Are you a man of means?<br> - Don't be bloody silly.<br> You know I was broke<br> when Ashe picked me up.<br> - Except for your taxi money.<br> - If you say so.<br> Then, now that you have paid your taxi we<br> may take it that you have no money at all.<br> Until you pay me for my services,<br> you may.<br> You cannot imagine<br> that some kindly benefactor...<br> someone perhaps<br> you have almost forgotten about...<br> would ever concern himself<br> with a donation to your next of kin...<br> or settling with your creditors?<br> - Some friend.<br> - I haven't got any friends.<br> Do you know George Smiley?<br> Mundt asked me that.<br> You are being asked it again.<br> I knew of him. I never met him.<br> He was not a close friend of yours?<br> I never met him.<br> I haven't got any friends.<br> Thank you.<br> Is... Is that all?<br> Yes, that is all.<br> You see, we too have a witness.<br> Alec.<br> Let the witness come forward.<br> Alec?<br> What is your name, child?<br> What is your name?<br> N-Nancy Perry.<br> You are a member of<br> the British Communist Party?<br> - Yes.<br> - Leave her alone.<br> If he moves again, take him out.<br> He can speak later, if he wishes.<br> Nancy...<br> have you been told in the Party<br> of the need for discipline?<br> Today the reason for this tribunal<br> will be a secret from you.<br> You will have to answer questions<br> without knowing why they are asked.<br> But -<br> But who's on trial?<br> It can make no difference to you<br> who is accused.<br> It is a guarantee of your impartiality<br> that you do not know.<br> Is it Alec? Is - Is it Leamas?<br> Look at me, child,<br> if you wish to go home.<br> Look only at who questions you.<br> If there is communication of any sort<br> between the two witnesses...<br> the man Leamas will be taken<br> from the court and dealt with.<br> Comrade Karden,<br> you wish to question your witness?<br> Alec Leamas was your lover, wasn't he?<br> Yes.<br> Have you had many lovers,<br> Nancy?<br> - Karden, why don't you...<br> - Alec, don't. They'll take you away.<br> Yes, they will.<br> Have you any savings?<br> - A little.<br> - How much?<br> A few pounds.<br> My salary's pretty small.<br> How small?<br> Eleven pounds.<br> How much is your rent?<br> Three pounds, 10.<br> Then why haven't you been paying it?<br> Why haven't you been paying it?<br> I own the lease.<br> You own a lease?<br> Well, I mean... I mean that<br> someone bought it and sent it to me.<br> - Who?<br> - I don't know.<br> It came from a bank,<br> a bank in the city called Blatt and Rodney.<br> They said<br> that some charity had done it.<br> What charity?<br> I don't know.<br> How much was the lease?<br> 1,000.<br> Are you accustomed to receiving<br> anonymous gifts of 1,000 from charities?<br> From lovers?<br> From Leamas?<br> No, I-I-I thought...<br> I thought it might have<br> come from him.<br> But Leamas has already told us<br> that he has no money, only debts.<br> No, I-I-I mean...<br> I mean from a friend of his.<br> Which friend?<br> I-I don't know.<br> Did anyone get into touch with you<br> after Leamas disappeared?<br> - No.<br> - Think.<br> - No.<br> - A friend of Leamas's?<br> No.<br> A man with a mustache<br> and spectacles?<br> Your house was watched, Nancy.<br> Who was he?<br> A lover?<br> A casual lover like Leamas?<br> - Alec wasn't a casual lover.<br> - But he gave you money.<br> Did this man give you money too?<br> - Who was he?<br> - I think it was a friend.<br> A friend of Alec's.<br> He - He wanted me to get in touch with...<br> How? How were you<br> to get in touch with him?<br> - H-He left a card.<br> - What was his name?<br> - I-I don't know.<br> - It was a blank card?<br> - No. I-It...<br> - What was the name on the card?<br> I don't know!<br> I - I don't remember...<br> What was the name on the card?<br> Smiley.<br> George Smiley.<br> Smiley was indeed Leamas's friend.<br> He was also a planner<br> in the section called Satellite Four...<br> which operates<br> behind the Iron Curtain.<br> It was to Smiley's Chelsea house...<br> that Leamas took the taxi<br> after lunching with Ashe...<br> and the plot to incriminate<br> Comrade Mundt was set in motion.<br> The plot has failed.<br> All right, Karden, let her go.<br> She knows nothing. Nothing at all.<br> Get her home. I'll tell you the rest.<br> - Don't tell them because of me.<br> - She cannot leave the court until...<br> - She knows nothing, I tell you!<br> - She cannot leave the court.<br> Karden is right.<br> It was an operation,<br> an operation planned by London...<br> in which I was to pose as a defector<br> and give evidence to Fiedler...<br> that would hang Mundt.<br> We counted on Fiedler, I must admit.<br> We counted on his hatred for Mundt.<br> And why the hell shouldn't he hate Mundt?<br> Mundt hates him.<br> As for the girl, she's nothing but a frustrated<br> little thing from a crackpot library.<br> She's no good to you.<br> Send her home.<br> What are you talking about, Leamas?<br> Are you mad?<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> Don't you realize what you are saying?<br> - Comrade Fiedler...<br> - Save the girl! Save the Jew!<br> Save my Christian soul!<br> Don't you realize what he has done?<br> He saved Mundt,<br> and Mundt is London's man!<br> Comrade Fiedler<br> will be held in custody.<br> The hearing is closed.<br> The tribunal will make<br> its report to the Praesidium.<br> Comrade Mundt is reinstated.<br> The man, Leamas, and the girl<br> are under arrest.<br> - So Fiedler was right.<br> - Yes.<br> Where's the girl?<br> By the car.<br> You hit the main road<br> after 20 kilometers. Turn right.<br> As you enter Berlin<br> you pass a signpost to Potsdam.<br> Turn right again. Go for four kilometers.<br> The road's quite straight.<br> When you reach the canal, turn left and follow<br> the water until you see three lights...<br> hanging on a diversion sign.<br> The boy will meet you there.<br> He's quite young, but he knows the Wall.<br> You'll never get away with it,<br> you know.<br> What will they find in the morning?<br> Empty cells, Leamas. Open doors.<br> Escaped prisoners. A car missing.<br> There's a conspiracy, you know.<br> I shall have to find the guilty ones,<br> the accomplices.<br> Do you know where I shall find them?<br> Amongst Fiedler's friends.<br> Conspirators. Scum.<br> Drive carefully.<br> Good-bye, Leamas.<br> - Why is he letting us go?<br> - He's letting us go because we've done our job.<br> - Come on, get in. We haven't much time.<br> - For what?<br> - Time to get to Berlin, to the Wall.<br> - To Berlin?<br> You and Mundt are enemies, aren't you?<br> What bargain did you<br> make with him, Alec?<br> What's going to happen to Fiedler?<br> He'll be shot.<br> Why didn't they shoot you?<br> You conspired with Fiedler against Mundt.<br> You said so in court.<br> Why did Mundt let you go?<br> All right, I'll tell you.<br> I'll tell you<br> what you were never, never to know.<br> Mundt is London's man.<br> He's their agent.<br> They bought him<br> while he was in England.<br> We're witnessing the lousy end to a filthy,<br> lousy operation to save Mundt's skin...<br> to save him from a clever little Jew<br> in Mundt's own department...<br> who had begun to suspect the truth.<br> London made us kill him...<br> kill the Jew.<br> Now you know.<br> God help us both.<br> You wait here.<br> Why did Mundt let me go?<br> I'm a risk to him now.<br> As you said, it was a bargain.<br> No you, no me.<br> What was my part in all this?<br> I want to know.<br> You were a pawn in the plot.<br> London knew it was no good<br> just killing Fiedler.<br> If he'd been killed, people would've<br> started asking by whom and why.<br> Maybe he'd told friends he suspected Mundt.<br> Maybe he'd left notes, incriminating notes.<br> London had to eliminate suspicion.<br> Public rehabilitation...<br> that's what they organized for Mundt.<br> I was sent to discredit him.<br> He was sent to discredit me.<br> And love?<br> We made it very easy for them.<br> They used us.<br> They cheated us both<br> because it was necessary.<br> Fiedler was nearly home already.<br> If it hadn't been for us,<br> Mundt would have been killed.<br> They were bloody clever.<br> All the way down the line<br> they were bloody clever.<br> Clever? They were foul!<br> How can you turn the world upside down?<br> What rules are you playing?<br> There's only one rule - expediency.<br> Mundt gives London what it needs,<br> so Fiedler dies and Mundt lives.<br> It was a foul, foul operation,<br> but it paid off.<br> Who for?<br> What the hell do you think spies are?<br> Moral philosophers measuring everything they<br> do against the word of God or Karl Marx?<br> They're not. They're just a bunch<br> of seedy, squalid bastards like me.<br> Little men, drunkards, queers,<br> henpecked husbands...<br> civil servants playing cowboys and Indians<br> to brighten their rotten little lives.<br> Do you think they sit like monks in a cell,<br> balancing right against wrong?<br> Yesterday I would have killed Mundt<br> because I thought him evil and an enemy.<br> But not today.<br> Today he's evil and my friend.<br> London needs him. They need him so that the<br> great, moronic masses you admire so much...<br> can sleep soundly<br> in their flea-bitten beds again.<br> They need him for the safety<br> of ordinary, crummy people like you and me.<br> You killed Fiedler!<br> How big does a cause have to be<br> before you kill your friends?<br> What about your Party?<br> There's a few million bodies on that path.<br> There is a moving searchlight beamed<br> onto the Wall where you are to climb.<br> Now, your signal to go<br> will be when the beam stops.<br> As you near the Wall they will<br> move the searchlight off that area...<br> to conceal you from outside observation<br> by other detachments.<br> Have the flanking detachments<br> been briefed?<br> No. No, only the guard<br> in the sector.<br> It would be too dangerous<br> to arouse too much curiosity.<br> Here go slowly, please.<br> It's the next on the left.<br> Stop.<br> Go through that small door.<br> At the far end you will see the Wall.<br> First there is a barbed-wire fence.<br> There's a handkerchief to show you<br> where you can go under.<br> The detachment have placed<br> the emergency climbing irons in the Wall...<br> to a height where you can stand,<br> pull yourself and the lady over the top.<br> - Through barbed wire?<br> - It has been cut.<br> If anything goes wrong...<br> If you fall or get hurt, don't turn back.<br> They shoot on sight within the area<br> of the Wall. You must get over.<br> Your friends will be waiting for you<br> on the far side. Good luck.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Go on.<br> Don't look back, Nan.<br> Climb. Climb!<br> - Nan!<br> - Jump, Alec!<br> Jump, man!<br> Mr. Leamas! Go back, please!<br>
