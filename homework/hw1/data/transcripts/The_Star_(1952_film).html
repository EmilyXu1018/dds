Of course,<br> Ronnie and Jennifer get in my hair.<br> They're such babies.<br> You did come for me, didn't you?<br> lt'll only take a minute<br> to get dressed and pack.<br> Where are we living now?<br> That's it.<br> Mother has a tiny apartment.<br> I don't care.<br> I just wanna be with you.<br> But Mother's gone most of the day.<br> - Well, where are you most of the day?<br> - At Mother's studio.<br> Mother,<br> I've got to ask you something.<br> Darling, not right now. Wait until<br> I've had a chance to talk to your father.<br> But he's on location,<br> and it's something very important.<br> Margaret, won't you come down?<br> - Hello, Peggy.<br> - lf you go down, can I go down?<br> Look, monkey, you should be asleep.<br> But I'm not sleepy,<br> and I won't go to sleep for hours. Please.<br> No, no, no, darling.<br> - You go up. I'll tuck you in later.<br> - All right.<br> What brings you here this time, Margaret?<br> Can I get you anything? A drink?<br> - Anything?<br> - No. No, thank you.<br> If it's about Gretchen...<br> ...she can stay on with us<br> indefinitely.<br> She's a delightful child.<br> Our kids adore her.<br> Thanks.<br> John calls me every day from Arizona.<br> I could tell him anything.<br> No. No, thank you.<br> Is it money?<br> Do you want more from John?<br> More money?<br> I never asked Johnny for money.<br> He's given you $2500<br> over the past two years.<br> Well, I gave him $25,000<br> when I divorced him so he could marry you.<br> - I dare say you didn't know that.<br> - He has no secrets from me.<br> He kept plenty of secrets from me.<br> That's a crack, I suppose.<br> You threw yourself at him.<br> You batted those eyes and told him<br> what a great big wonderful man he was.<br> You told him how bad I was for him,<br> that I was too busy with my career...<br> ...that what he needed was a real wife.<br> - Pure soap opera. He fell for it.<br> - Because it happened to be the truth.<br> His name was Morgan.<br> He didn't like being Mr. Elliot.<br> Living in Miss Elliot's house,<br> entertaining Miss Elliot's guests.<br> Why, he wasn't even Miss Elliot's husband.<br> He was her lover by appointment.<br> When she wasn't too tired<br> or afraid to muss her hair.<br> Well, I think we've had our talk.<br> Forgive me.<br> You deserved to lose him, Margaret.<br> I've made him happy<br> because I've let him be Mr. Morgan.<br> Thank you very much<br> for the inside story.<br> Mother, you promised.<br> I can only stay a minute, dear.<br> We'll catch it<br> if we wake up Ronnie and Jennifer.<br> All right. Jump in.<br> You remember.<br> There's something I have to ask you.<br> Yes, sweetie, what is it?<br> You...<br> You are a big movie star, aren't you?<br> Why?<br> Well, the kids at day camp...<br> ...they say you don't make pictures<br> anymore, and...<br> ...Janie Marks, her father's a writer...<br> ...and she said he told her mother that...<br> ...you were...<br> ...washed-up.<br> So I beat up on her.<br> That's how I got this scratch.<br> You tell this Janie Marks<br> your mother is a star.<br> I know you were.<br> But are you now?<br> Well, if you're a star,<br> you don't stop being a star.<br> But they say you'll never make<br> another picture.<br> I'm going to begin a new picture<br> in three weeks.<br> Oh, well,<br> when you're making this picture...<br> ...can I do my six months with you?<br> Yes. Yes, darling.<br> Oh, am I glad. I love you.<br> You're so beautiful,<br> and you always smell so good.<br> I wanted to put on<br> some of the perfume you like.<br> But there wasn't any.<br> Why are you crying?<br> Haven't you ever cried<br> because you're happy?<br> No.<br> Well, you see,<br> some people cry when they are happy...<br> ...and laugh when they are mad.<br> That's funny.<br> Isn't it funny?<br> Now, lie down.<br> Good night, you darling.<br> Get some sleep.<br> Good evening, Miss Elliot.<br> Good evening, Mrs. Adams.<br> I think the door's unlocked.<br> Your sister and her husband<br> stopped by. I let them in as usual.<br> Is that all? Thank you.<br> I wish that were all.<br> Mrs. Adams, you have to give me<br> one more day.<br> I'd love to give you more time.<br> But Jones and Company<br> had me on the carpet again today.<br> - lf you could let me have just one month...<br> - Don't they know who I am?<br> Didn't you tell them that<br> there's a contract on my agent's desk...<br> ...with just a few minor details<br> to iron out?<br> I told them,<br> but they are an impersonal organization.<br> You're not Miss Elliot to them.<br> You're merely the tenant<br> of number 1257.<br> But sometimes families are different.<br> Couldn't you perhaps ask your relatives?<br> My goodness, Margaret, where you been?<br> Roy and I gotta get started for Alhambra.<br> - I didn't know you were coming, Faith.<br> - It's the first of the month.<br> Miss Elliot. Don't let it worry you tonight.<br> We'll talk tomorrow.<br> You been to some glamour party?<br> Yeah, I had a ball.<br> - Hello, Margaret. I was hungry.<br> - Roy.<br> Goodness, you seem to have<br> time for everything...<br> ...except get out to Alhambra.<br> Mama's been asking after you.<br> Her hip still hasn't mended.<br> She's in bed most of the day.<br> Of course, I'm not complaining,<br> but, well, with the twins on my hands...<br> You ought to see those twins, Margaret.<br> Such great big boys,<br> growing out of everything.<br> I haven't bought a stitch<br> for myself lately, not a stitch.<br> Why, the cost of shoes alone<br> for those boys...<br> I'm afraid I haven't any shoes<br> for 14-year-old boys.<br> For heaven's sakes, who was asking?<br> I was just telling you the family news.<br> - Aren't you interested?<br> - I have some interesting family news too.<br> I've just come from my auction.<br> You mean you're selling<br> all those nice things?<br> I'm not. My creditors are.<br> I'm bankrupt. Broke. Get it?<br> Understand?<br> Well!<br> Well, my goodness,<br> I always knew you were extravagant and all.<br> Whoever needed two Cadillacs<br> and all those servants and secretaries...<br> ...and always redecorating the house<br> and such.<br> But I never said anything,<br> because you would have gotten mad if I did.<br> You were making all that money.<br> I still don't see where it all went.<br> I'll explain it to you.<br> I bought the house you're living in.<br> You promised to pay me back, remember?<br> And I paid for the birth of the twins,<br> their clothes...<br> ...their saxophone lessons<br> and Roy's four operations.<br> Can I help it<br> if Roy enjoys poor health?<br> - And you know what Mother cost me.<br> - Mama is living with us now.<br> And I set Roy up in business<br> after he'd been fired...<br> ...from the job I got him<br> in the Purchasing Department at the studio.<br> It was your idea<br> that he have an antique shop.<br> Roy didn't know anything about antiques.<br> Did you, Roy?<br> And he didn't know anything<br> about the laundry business.<br> That was his idea.<br> Was it his fault<br> everybody started buying Whirlpools?<br> Now, now, girls. Let's not have a ruckus.<br> If you'll just give us the monthly check,<br> we'll be shoving along.<br> Can't you get it<br> through your thick skull that I'm broke?<br> Dead, flat, stony broke! See?<br> I've got $3.85 in my purse.<br> Do you want that, Roy?<br> Margaret didn't mean that.<br> I have given you over $50,000.<br> You must have some of it stashed away.<br> Could I have $200<br> on account tonight, Roy?<br> - What?<br> - For heaven's sakes.<br> Where would we get money like that?<br> You could print it if I'd only thought<br> to give Roy a printing press.<br> You're tired.<br> You wouldn't say that...<br> Yes, I'm sick, and I'm tired!<br> Now, leave me alone. Leave me alone!<br> - lf that's the way you feel...<br> - That is the way I feel.<br> Now, I want you both to get out of here.<br> Get out!<br> Come on, Oscar.<br> Let's you and me get drunk.<br> To absent friends.<br> On your right,<br> ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...is the home of Mitzi Gaynor,<br> rising young movie star.<br> How young can you be?<br> And on your left...<br> ...is the home of Mr. and Mrs. Brinkman...<br> ...better known to you tourists<br> as Jeanne Crain.<br> Oscar.<br> That looks like the kind of monstrosity<br> that Barbara Lawrence would choose.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> the home of Barbara...<br> ...Lawrence.<br> And that, Oscar...<br> ...was the home of the wealthy, exciting...<br> ...glamorous Margaret Elliot.<br> I remember the day you came home.<br> That was the day.<br> Going...<br> ...going...<br> ...gone.<br> I wonder where I am now.<br> Why don't you watch where you're going!<br> Take your hands off me!<br> Okay, sister, have it your way.<br> There's your bed. Sleep it off.<br> You don't seem to know who I am!<br> What are you in for, honey?<br> As if I didn't know.<br> Please forgive the matron for<br> failing to introduce us formally.<br> She's never read Emily Post.<br> Who do you think you are?<br> Everybody knows who I am.<br> I'm Margaret Elliot.<br> What a coincidence. I'm Snow White.<br> - Charmed to know you.<br> - But I am Margaret Elliot!<br> She's stinking.<br> - I guess she's alive.<br> - How can you tell?<br> Oh, my dirty name.<br> It is Margaret Elliot. Hey, wake up.<br> We got royalty.<br> We got a real live movie star.<br> Two hundred fifty dollars.<br> Here's your receipt, Mr. Johannsen.<br> Why did you do it?<br> You were in trouble, so I bailed you out.<br> Why you, of all people?<br> Well, why not me?<br> Sometimes it's good to talk about it.<br> I made a picture once.<br> I played a girl who was arrested.<br> It was called Night Court.<br> Critics said it was great.<br> I guess they had never spent<br> a night in jail.<br> Next time you'll know better.<br> Next time.<br> I still want to know<br> why you did it.<br> You did a swell thing for me once.<br> I go out to repair your bathhouse,<br> ...l'm playing opposite<br> Margaret Elliot in Faithless.<br> And with a brand-new name. Barry Lester.<br> How I hated that name.<br> Well, there's never been a movie star<br> named Jim Johannsen.<br> Barry Lester, either.<br> Well, the name had nothing to do with it.<br> You're so right.<br> I saw Faithless two years later<br> onboard a ship out in the Pacific.<br> We were anchored in the harbor<br> of Kwajalein at the time. Man, was it hot.<br> Faithless wasn't so bad.<br> No, it wasn't so bad. It's only<br> the worst picture ever made, that's all.<br> It even bored those poor guys who hadn't<br> had any entertainment in six months.<br> When it was over, the gunnery officer came<br> up to me, and he said, real suspicious-like:<br> "Hey, chief. You any relation to that jerk?<br> You kind of look like him."<br> I'm sure glad I was wearing a beard<br> in those days. Why, if they'd ever found...<br> Go ahead, eat.<br> - I don't want anything.<br> - So you spent a night in the clink.<br> Eat your breakfast. It's paid for.<br> Here, give it to me.<br> There was nothing I could do. After they<br> read the papers, they changed the lock.<br> Don't tell anyone, but I managed to get out<br> some of your clothes.<br> Thank you. You're very kind.<br> I'm not kind, but I like to think<br> I'm a human being.<br> Thank you.<br> Where to?<br> Isn't this the end of the line?<br> - You must have plenty of friends.<br> - Sure. I'm the perfect guest.<br> Who wouldn't be happy to have me?<br> Get in.<br> This is it.<br> Right after the war,<br> I got title to this place...<br> ...with the help of a GI loan.<br> Always wanted my own business.<br> Better than getting up in the morning...<br> ...and having some character<br> slap makeup on your puss.<br> This was a sail loft before I fixed it up.<br> One thing about having a shipyard,<br> you can do these things for free.<br> I picked up a lot of these things<br> while I was going to sea.<br> What am I going to do?<br> Get any sleep last night?<br> With all that howling?<br> One of them was full of hop...<br> ...and two of them got into a brawl.<br> Get yourself some sleep.<br> I'll have my lawyer square things at court.<br> I've got a lot of things to do.<br> I can't think.<br> I can't think.<br> Of course you can't.<br> I shouldn't be here.<br> There's something I've got to do.<br> I can't remember.<br> I'll be out in the yard if you need anything.<br> Hello, Peggy.<br> Peggy, did Gretchen read the paper?<br> Well, thanks.<br> Thanks. That was very nice of you.<br> What?<br> Oh, those nasty kids.<br> But you told her, didn't you?<br> You told her it wasn't true?<br> Well... Well, thanks.<br> Thanks for trying.<br> I'm all right.<br> I'd like to speak to her, Peggy.<br> I promise I won't upset her.<br> I want to talk to her, Peggy,<br> you've got to let me talk to her.<br> All right.<br> Hello, darling.<br> This is Mother.<br> How are you?<br> Sweetie. Sweetie, you didn't fall for<br> what those kids said, did you?<br> No, it was just a publicity stunt. Mother...<br> Mother was at the jail getting atmosphere<br> for her new picture.<br> Yes, I know what the papers said, but...<br> The reporters were all wrong.<br> You know how reporters are.<br> Of course it isn't true, Gretchen.<br> You know how policemen love me.<br> Remember that nice patrolman<br> at Bel Air...<br> ...who used to come and see me<br> every Christmas Eve?<br> And I let you give him a present?<br> Well, why don't you play hooky<br> from camp for a few days...<br> ...and let them gossip all they want to.<br> You know gossip doesn't hurt us.<br> Goodbye, darling.<br> All right. See you soon.<br> - You shouldn't talk to anybody till you rest.<br> - Are you a doctor or something?<br> Something.<br> You're gonna stay here a few days<br> until this blows over.<br> Then we'll decide where you're going.<br> Going, going, gone.<br> Come on, Margaret. Snap out of it.<br> Why don't you grab yourself a shower<br> and get cleaned up.<br> Then come on down and get some fresh air.<br> I don't see why you're so kind to me.<br> I'll tell you one day.<br> You know, this is a sweet little motor.<br> But it's in here for repairs<br> at least once a week.<br> Owner can't just let it purr<br> like it's made to.<br> He's gotta keep her going<br> wide open all the time.<br> Would you hand me that wrench?<br> Right there beside you. The wrench.<br> Thanks.<br> Remember that scene in<br> Vacation for a Lady...<br> ...where I was snowed-in<br> in the forest ranger's cabin?<br> So?<br> Well, so this reminds me of it.<br> I was running from the ski resort because<br> I didn't wanna marry Ralph Bellows.<br> Ralph always played the rich,<br> stuffy second lead.<br> I was lost in the blizzard<br> and stumbled into a cabin, half dead.<br> It was a terrible-looking place.<br> Untidy, the dishes unwashed.<br> Thanks.<br> I didn't mean that. I meant the mood.<br> The lady. That was me.<br> - And the poor young man.<br> - Was me.<br> No, no. Clark Spencer.<br> Are you sure you never saw it?<br> I've seen it a thousand times.<br> It made 4 and a half million.<br> - You know all I ever got out of it?<br> - What?<br> Hundred and fifty thousand dollars.<br> I feel very, very sorry for you.<br> Would you hold this for me?<br> - What for?<br> - I've only got two hands.<br> Just lift up on it.<br> Do you mind?<br> Why should I mind?<br> You know something<br> I always remembered about you?<br> What?<br> Your perfume.<br> - What was it?<br> - Desire Me.<br> The most expensive perfume in the world.<br> The names they think up.<br> - Maybe that's where some of it went.<br> - What?<br> Your dough.<br> I'll tell you exactly where it went.<br> I was on top.<br> Put my name on the marquee of any<br> theater, there'd be a line around the block.<br> But I was sick of the tripe<br> they forced me to play.<br> I read how you hollered about that.<br> So I put my own money<br> into three wonderful pictures.<br> The big companies wouldn't give me<br> a decent release...<br> ...so I lost everything.<br> They said I was box-office poison.<br> You wouldn't be bitter or anything?<br> Wouldn't you?<br> Maybe. Maybe not.<br> Margaret.<br> Did you ever figure it might be you<br> who gave yourself a dirty deal?<br> - What kind of double talk is that?<br> - Well, it just doesn't add up.<br> If your name on a marquee<br> makes people shovel in their quarters...<br> ...then why isn't it there now?<br> They juggled the books.<br> They said all my independent pictures<br> were flops.<br> Of course, they lied.<br> I got tremendous fan mail,<br> and believe me...<br> ...you don't win an Academy Award<br> for nothing.<br> All right. Skip it.<br> I don't understand the picture business.<br> They won't give me a chance anymore.<br> You're confusing what was<br> with what is.<br> That's why you got drunk last night<br> and tried to kill yourself.<br> Me, kill myself?<br> If I were gonna kill myself,<br> I'd rip the lid off this town first.<br> Look at it this way, Margaret.<br> You've had a sleigh ride.<br> It was swell while it lasted.<br> Now it's over.<br> It's not over. It'll never be over.<br> And now for a five-minute summary<br> of the latest headline.<br> Beverly Hills, California.<br> Margaret Elliot, famed Hollywood star who<br> was arrested last night for drunk driving...<br> ... gave the arresting officer...<br> Since she was released on bail,<br> efforts to locate her...<br> ... have been without avail.<br> Where she is, nobody knows.<br> Reporters are at present checking<br> a report that she is visiting a...<br> I think I'll tell that announcer<br> the real story.<br> Margaret Elliot is the guest<br> of Jim Johannsen...<br> ...wet nurse to sick boats.<br> Spending a glamorous holiday...<br> ...with a mechanic<br> who bought her for 250 dollars' bail.<br> What did you say?<br> You know, I just figured it out.<br> - What?<br> - Why you bailed me out.<br> If that's what you've figured, you're wrong.<br> Well, that's why the heavy bailed me out in<br> a very successful film called Night Court.<br> Can't you ever think<br> beyond a script?<br> - The truth makes the man mad.<br> - Margaret, don't go on.<br> Or perhaps you were always<br> in love with me? Is that it?<br> Lots of men have been, and you're a man.<br> And I once thought you were a woman.<br> But I was wrong.<br> You're nothing but a career.<br> And when you've said that,<br> you've said it all.<br> Then you were in love with me.<br> I suppose I was.<br> I thought you were the greatest.<br> And now?<br> You wouldn't want to hear that.<br> Just listen to your ego.<br> It's all you have left.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Could I have some sleeping pills?<br> - Your prescription, please?<br> I'm afraid I haven't any prescription.<br> I can't sell you sleeping pills<br> without a doctor's prescription, lady.<br> What a bore...<br> ...when all I need is a good night's sleep.<br> Couldn't you...?<br> Excuse me.<br> Jim, I stole this.<br> I never stole anything before in my life.<br> Jim, what's gotten into me?<br> You're all mixed-up.<br> But I don't need perfume.<br> Nobody needs perfume!<br> - I'll pay for it tomorrow.<br> - What's the matter with me?<br> That's a mighty good question.<br> Going, going, gone.<br> No. No, you're not.<br> You know something is the matter,<br> and that's the first step.<br> What am I going to do, Jim?<br> Tell me what to do.<br> Well, I think we'll go sailing tomorrow.<br> You've got time to go sailing<br> and take your kid.<br> What's she like now? Your kid, I mean.<br> How can you tell what a kid's like?<br> Here.<br> Blow.<br> I'm sorry about the things I said.<br> Forget it.<br> I'm sorry about a lot of things.<br> Who isn't?<br> You thought I was doing you a favor...<br> ...when I forced them to give you the lead<br> in Faithless, didn't you?<br> You were.<br> I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.<br> I wanted to show Charles Humphrey.<br> - Humphrey? What's he got to do with it?<br> - I wanted him for the picture...<br> ...and he balked.<br> I heard that he said<br> he wouldn't play horse to my Godiva.<br> And it made me mad.<br> And I swore I'd pick out<br> the very first man I saw...<br> ...and make him a bigger star<br> than Charlie ever was.<br> And I was the first man.<br> Next day, I was down by the pool,<br> and I heard someone yell.<br> I looked up on the roof, and there you were<br> with a hammer, cursing your head off.<br> I'd just banged my finger.<br> And I called, "Hey, mister,<br> come down here a minute."<br> - Remember?<br> - Yeah.<br> You were really something<br> in that blue outfit.<br> Really?<br> I'd never seen anybody like you in my life.<br> So you see, you don't owe me a thing.<br> An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.<br> Bail for a favor.<br> Margaret,<br> that's not the way real people live.<br> It isn't.<br> Here.<br> Might as well use it.<br> Jim, couldn't you take it back to the man?<br> Tell him that I picked it up by mistake.<br> And tell him that...<br> That's funny.<br> It hasn't any odor.<br> Where did this come from?<br> From a little drugstore near the theater,<br> on top of the counter.<br> It must have been a display bottle.<br> It's nothing but colored water.<br> Colored water?<br> Well, when you grabbed it,<br> you thought it was real.<br> It's the story of your life, isn't it?<br> Jim, look at the big fish.<br> It's jumping out of the water!<br> That's an old friend of mine.<br> I call him Rover.<br> Rover? What a name for a fish.<br> Be careful, Gretchen. If you fell over...<br> She won't. She's a good sailor.<br> Am I?<br> Mother, did you hear what Jim said?<br> - Jim said I was a good sailor.<br> - I heard.<br> If I am a good sailor, can I steer?<br> Why, sure. Man the tiller.<br> We're gonna change course now.<br> When we do, the first<br> thing we yell is, "Coming about!"<br> Jam the tiller way over there. That's it.<br> Watch your head, Margaret.<br> Gee, that was fun. Can we do it again?<br> And can I say it?<br> - Why not?<br> - Now?<br> All right. Now.<br> - That's it. Way over.<br> - Coming about!<br> We forgot to say "duck."<br> - You know what?<br> - What?<br> I haven't heard the word "Hollywood"<br> all day.<br> You see that horizon?<br> Beyond it,<br> there's 6000 miles of open ocean.<br> It's got a life all its own.<br> Back here in the city,<br> a million men...<br> ...fight to make a buck so they can eat<br> and fight some more.<br> Aren't you fighting like the rest of them?<br> To make a buck?<br> We've all gotta eat.<br> You know, it's funny. I was just thinking.<br> Sailors are a lot like actors.<br> With them, it's always the next ship,<br> the next voyage.<br> With actors, it's the next part,<br> the next picture.<br> Always chasing rainbows.<br> Aren't you chasing rainbows?<br> I used to chase them. All around the world.<br> You're still chasing them<br> all over Hollywood.<br> Margaret, if you can forget that rat race<br> for one day...<br> You mean, give up my career?<br> It's no disgrace to be through in pictures.<br> You've got a lifetime ahead of you.<br> What will you do with it?<br> But what else is there for me?<br> You could go into real estate...<br> ...or start a restaurant<br> or even be a saleslady.<br> But, Jim, I've never done anything but act.<br> All right, act. Play it like another part<br> at first. Give a performance.<br> I wouldn't know where to begin.<br> What are the names of some of those<br> fancy stores up at Beverly Hills?<br> Not Magnin's, not Saks.<br> Have everybody gloat over me?<br> Have everybody say<br> "There is Margaret Elliot."<br> No, thanks.<br> Well, then, get out of Beverly Hills.<br> That's not the world.<br> Long Beach has stores. Glendale. Pasadena.<br> And, it may surprise you, people too.<br> It's wonderful to hear you laugh again.<br> It's chilly.<br> I'll wake Gretchen up.<br> Wake up, darling.<br> We're in.<br> All right, let's try it again.<br> What's your name?<br> Margaret Morgan.<br> I suppose that's my real name too.<br> Miss or missus?<br> Well, which do you think is best?<br> I think missus. Husband deceased.<br> Experience?<br> Four and a half years at<br> Marshall Field's... in Lingerie.<br> Margaret.<br> You're okay.<br> And if you get the job, we'll celebrate.<br> I'll bet I know a place you've never been.<br> Fine. Won't you come in, please?<br> Name, please.<br> Margaret Morgan.<br> That's funny.<br> Your voice... You look like her too.<br> She's a movie star.<br> Margaret Elliot.<br> I get that all the time.<br> People have even come up<br> and asked me for her autograph.<br> Married or single?<br> Widowed.<br> My husband was killed in the war at Anzio.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Thank you.<br> Experience?<br> Well, I've had four and a half years<br> at Marshall Field's.<br> In Lingerie.<br> I think I'd like to have you<br> talk to our Mr. Cartwright, in Lingerie.<br> Marshall Field's.<br> That's good background.<br> Yes, I thought you would think so.<br> The young lady will show you<br> to Mr. Cartwright's office.<br> Thank you.<br> Here you are.<br> Jim, look. See that little sad-faced one?<br> That's our Mr. Cartwright.<br> I did have one bad moment when he said<br> he had once worked at Marshall Field's.<br> - You ever been in Marshall Field's?<br> - What else is there to do in Chicago...<br> ...except take a bath at the Blackstone<br> or go to Marshall Field's?<br> He didn't ask to see references.<br> I had the most wonderful references.<br> After my husband was killed,<br> I had to sell the car.<br> They were left in<br> the glove compartment.<br> And the people who bought it<br> just disappeared from the face of the earth.<br> I gave one of my best performances<br> for that little baboon.<br> Listen to that sea lion.<br> Sounds like my brother-in-law.<br> What do you suppose they think about?<br> I wonder where people live<br> who work at May's Crenshaw.<br> One thing at a time. You might get fired.<br> As a saleslady? No such luck.<br> You sure you don't want a hot dog,<br> popcorn, anything like that?<br> If you like.<br> Thank you, madam.<br> Oh, dear.<br> I used to be able to wear things like this.<br> Let's take a little vow to lose 10 pounds<br> by Labor Day.<br> If we could do it together...<br> Misery loves company.<br> - Miss?<br> - Yes, madam.<br> How much is this negligee?<br> $39.95. Isn't it lovely?<br> Let me see that.<br> - The black one?<br> - Please.<br> Yes, madam.<br> Well, what in the world<br> do you want with that?<br> - That's Margaret Elliot.<br> - It couldn't be. She's in jail.<br> No, some mystery man got her out.<br> I read all about it.<br> If it is Margaret Elliot,<br> I think it's a disgrace...<br> ...for a respectable store like this<br> to hire a jailbird.<br> It's Margaret Elliot all right.<br> You can't fool me.<br> She was my favorite movie star.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Besides, Margaret was<br> much better-looking than her.<br> Take a good look, ladies...<br> ...so there's no doubt.<br> It is Margaret Elliot, and it is a disgrace.<br> Margaret Elliot waiting on<br> a couple of old bags like you.<br> You can't talk to us this way.<br> I'll call the manager.<br> Call the manager. Call the president.<br> Call the fire department.<br> I won't be here.<br> I'm going back where I belong.<br> I am Margaret Elliot,<br> and I intend to stay Margaret Elliot.<br> - Miss Elliot.<br> - Hello, Jane.<br> Mr. Stone's been<br> combing the town for you.<br> - Tell him I'm here.<br> - Miss Elliot is here.<br> Why, Maggie. Maggie.<br> I didn't know<br> whether you were dead or alive.<br> I went to the jail.<br> Someone had bailed you out.<br> - Then you were at the jail.<br> - Yes. I had the money in hand.<br> - Didn't you know I'd come running?<br> - No.<br> Now, Maggie. Remember me?<br> I'm your friend.<br> - Then get me that part in The Fatal Winter.<br> - Now, slow down.<br> Where were you?<br> You had us running in circles.<br> I've been running in circles,<br> but not my circles.<br> I want you to take me to Joe Morrison.<br> I don't know.<br> This may not be the right time.<br> - Right time. You're stalling.<br> - Those stories in the paper, that's not good.<br> Joe Morrison is mad about publicity.<br> Well, it's an angle. I'll think it over.<br> Think it over? You're always<br> thinking things over. We're going now.<br> Maggie, you wait here.<br> When you go in, I want you<br> to go in right. No begging.<br> Maggie.<br> One more thing. Promise me.<br> Don't give Joe any of your ideas.<br> He has the ideas.<br> Joe.<br> Well, Harry.<br> - You want to see me?<br> - How's the picture going?<br> It may not make any money,<br> but it's a beautiful picture.<br> Come on up.<br> Well, my boy, which one of your unhappy<br> clients wants more money from me today?<br> Well, Joe...<br> ...l'll let you off easy. I came<br> to talk to you about Margaret Elliot.<br> Terrible thing. Poor girl.<br> The competition, the pressure.<br> You and I go through it every day,<br> but we're tough.<br> We don't see our faces<br> enlarged a thousand times in close-ups.<br> - A good thing.<br> - They forget they're people.<br> They get up there at the top, begin to slip,<br> and they get panicky.<br> Now Margaret Elliot. I hate to see it.<br> Joe, if you'd give her a part, it would be<br> one of the finest things anyone's ever done.<br> - Great publicity for you.<br> - No. No.<br> I like to see my name in the papers.<br> It sells tickets to my pictures.<br> I won't trade on the weaknesses<br> and misfortunes of these poor people.<br> If I give Margaret a part,<br> it's because she's right for it.<br> She asked me to talk to you<br> about The Fatal Winter.<br> But, Harry, the girl in the story is 18.<br> - Barbara Lawrence will do it.<br> - Margaret optioned that book.<br> - It's important to her.<br> - Everything is important to stars.<br> What do we do with them or without them?<br> They're so naughty, like children.<br> At the same time,<br> they're so appealing, like children.<br> - Won't you just see her?<br> - Why? I've nothing for her.<br> She's right out there in the car. Just to<br> be inside of a studio would buck her up.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Do you suppose she'd play the older sister?<br> It's not a big part, but it's strong.<br> Well, she ought to.<br> You can sell her on the idea.<br> Terrible to have to sell somebody something<br> that's good for them. I'm used to it.<br> - Yes, Mr. Morrison?<br> - Miss Elliot is out front in Mr. Stone's car.<br> - Will you send for her, please.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Just a minute.<br> - Ask Mrs. Morrison to come in, will you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> My wife and Margaret Elliot<br> were very good friends.<br> Besides, my wife is more diplomatic<br> than I am.<br> Hello, Miss Elliot. Go right in.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Morrison are waiting.<br> Thanks.<br> How good to see you, Maggie.<br> Hello, Ruth.<br> - Joe.<br> - Margaret, you're looking wonderful.<br> - Well, thanks. Never felt better in my life.<br> - How's your lovely little daughter?<br> She's very well, thank you.<br> Well, the story editor is on his way in<br> with the test scene.<br> Test?<br> My dear, I know you've not needed<br> to make a test for a long time...<br> ...but this role will be a departure for you.<br> She wants to make a test.<br> Don't you, Margaret?<br> Of course I'll make a test.<br> Ruth, how old do you see the girl?<br> Oh, 40-ish.<br> I see.<br> You want me to play the older sister.<br> Yes. If we like the test,<br> we'll build that part to take advantage...<br> ...of your talent.<br> I see.<br> Well, that will be quite a challenge.<br> A very interesting experiment.<br> I'm a strange sort of recluse, see?<br> I suppose she's had a tragic love affair, but<br> that doesn't mean she can't look attractive.<br> Anyhow, I rented a small chicken farm<br> from some people named Garfield.<br> And I run it alone.<br> And there's been a murder, and I've seen it.<br> And the Garfield family is mixed up in it,<br> and I know it.<br> And one of the Garfield men<br> comes to tell me that I didn't see it.<br> And that's the test scene.<br> Cue me, would you, Jim?<br> Wait a minute.<br> I'm supposed to be scrubbing the floor.<br> There. Ready?<br> It says here, "He knocks on the door."<br> Knock, knock, knock.<br> Who is it?<br> "He enters, stands looking down at Sarah."<br> - Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?<br> - You can do as you like.<br> It says here she speaks in a sullen manner.<br> Jim, disregard the stage directions. That's<br> one of the first things a real actress learns.<br> Who's directing The Fatal Winter?<br> A character named Keith Barkley<br> from the stage.<br> Thinks he's slumming out here.<br> If I were you, Margaret,<br> I'd play along with him.<br> Jim, will you admit<br> I know more about Hollywood than you do?<br> Directors are like anybody<br> in the driver's seat. They wanna drive.<br> I've been managing directors for years.<br> Margaret, I don't wanna see you<br> hurt again...<br> ...like those two old bats<br> hurt you at the store.<br> But, Jim, that was this morning,<br> and I wasn't hurt. I was just plain mad.<br> You don't get mad unless you're hurt.<br> Jim, no lecture tonight.<br> Come on, let's start from the beginning.<br> Yeah, I'll take care of that. Sure. Yeah.<br> This way, Miss Elliot.<br> Will you bring me a glass of water?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> - Miss Elliot.<br> - Yes?<br> Your glass of water.<br> Thank you.<br> - Yes?<br> - We're ready on the set, Miss Elliot.<br> I'll be there in just a moment.<br> - Hello.<br> - Good morning.<br> George, how nice.<br> - Stu. Stu, how's the family?<br> - Fine, thank you.<br> Hello.<br> Miss Elliot.<br> Miss Elliot,<br> you look a little young for this part.<br> Really? Women of 42 these days don't have<br> to look ready for the old ladies' home.<br> Well, not the women we know...<br> ...but this is a special case. She hasn't<br> bothered to keep up her appearance.<br> - She avoids people.<br> - I've read the book, Mr. Barkley.<br> J.M. How sweet of you<br> to come down and see me.<br> - Good luck, dear.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Now, you two be nice to each other.<br> - I always get along with my directors.<br> - Sure. Sure.<br> - Are you going to watch the test?<br> No, I just came to wish you both good luck.<br> I never interfere on the set.<br> - Bless you.<br> - You and I know this is just a formality.<br> - Of course.<br> - Good. Good.<br> Good luck.<br> - Goodbye, J.M.<br> - Goodbye, dear.<br> Well. Thank you. Shall we rehearse?<br> Miss Elliot, Mr. Bailey is going to play<br> the part of Jed.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Mr. Bailey's a good actor.<br> He worked for me in New York.<br> How nice. We can use good actors.<br> Let's run through it.<br> You enter this door, look around.<br> Make yourself at home,<br> as if you own the place.<br> All right, quiet, please.<br> This is a rehearsal.<br> Settle down, boys.<br> Action.<br> Who is it?<br> Aren't you gonna ask me to sit down?<br> You can do anything you like.<br> It isn't like you to pay a social visit,<br> Jed Garfield.<br> Cut.<br> - Anything wrong?<br> - Miss Elliot, you're too light.<br> This woman is sullen.<br> She's not flirting. He's her enemy.<br> If she wants to win her point,<br> she's got to use sex.<br> But this woman has no sex.<br> - Every woman has sex.<br> - But you're playing it like a young girl.<br> Do you really think so?<br> We've gotta get<br> this point straight.<br> Mr. Barkley, I've been in this business<br> a long time, and I know what I'm doing.<br> - I'm sure you do.<br> - George.<br> George, Ernie Laszlo used to<br> play the key light from this side of my face.<br> He used to say if I got bored<br> being a star, I could run the camera.<br> Would you bring me the mirror?<br> Dave, move that key light over there,<br> will you?<br> George, you see how much better that is,<br> don't you?<br> I see, Miss Elliot.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, shall we go on rehearsing?<br> No, we might as well shoot it.<br> All right, settle down, boys. This is a take.<br> Ready, boys? Roll them.<br> Speed.<br> Test, Margaret Elliot, take one.<br> Action.<br> Who is it?<br> Aren't you gonna ask me to sit down?<br> You can do anything you like.<br> It isn't like you<br> to pay a social visit, Jed Garfield.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - You got it fixed real nice, Sarah.<br> - Real nice.<br> - I like things nice.<br> What do you want?<br> You used to be quite a girl.<br> You still think you are, don't you?<br> I still know what's right from wrong.<br> Do you think it right to tell folks you seen<br> him in the lane the night of the murder...<br> ...when you know he wasn't<br> within 30 miles of there?<br> I was there, Jed Garfield.<br> You know I was there.<br> But if you was there,<br> what was you doing there?<br> None of your business<br> what I was doing there.<br> It's my business if you're trying<br> to ruin my brother.<br> Maybe I was thinking<br> of what he tried to do to me.<br> You don't know Lance when he's crossed.<br> I know Lance Garfield pretty well.<br> You don't know how well<br> I know your brother.<br> Cut. Print.<br> You mean I got it in one take?<br> - Was it all right?<br> - Fine, fine. Your fans would love it.<br> - Bless you. George, how did I look?<br> - You looked fine there, Miss Elliot.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> Thank you, all. Thank you.<br> Thank you, Mr. Bailey. See you soon.<br> I wish I could come and tell you all about it.<br> Fine. Oh, yes, he said it was fine.<br> The cameraman said I looked great.<br> Harry, I may have a surprise for you.<br> When the Morrisons see this test,<br> it might very well be...<br> ...that I would play the girl I've always<br> wanted to play in The Fatal Winter.<br> Stranger things have happened.<br> Harry, Harry, I can't talk now.<br> I've got a million and one things to do.<br> Stop worrying. See you tomorrow.<br> Bye.<br> Jim? Jim?<br> Oh, Jim.<br> - I've had the most wonderful day.<br> - You struck oil?<br> They let me have a Cadillac on approval.<br> And I found the most wonderful house,<br> with a divine pool.<br> And you should see the clothes<br> I ordered. This is nothing.<br> Looks like plenty of nothing.<br> It's so wonderful to dare<br> to go and charge things again.<br> You wouldn't be a little charged yourself,<br> would you?<br> Luckily, my old publicity girl is available.<br> We've just mapped out<br> a sensational campaign.<br> I'm very good with publicity ideas,<br> you know.<br> Tonight we're going to Romanoff's<br> to celebrate my return to the screen.<br> - You got the part?<br> - Well, we see the test tomorrow.<br> - Then you haven't got the part?<br> - As Joe says, it's a mere formality.<br> You don't know what it means<br> to stand in front of a camera again.<br> You're going to have a little brother.<br> Well, are you going to take me out,<br> or do I have to get myself a new boy?<br> I know a quiet little place<br> over in Long Beach.<br> Quiet little place.<br> We're going to Romanoff's...<br> ...and then dancing at Mocambo.<br> - Margaret.<br> Don't you want to go<br> out on the town with me?<br> - It isn't...<br> - Jim, don't make me beg.<br> I've begged so much.<br> All right, Margaret.<br> You can't go looking like that.<br> Haven't you anything to wear?<br> - I have a very nice suit.<br> - Well, put it on while I freshen up.<br> Margaret?<br> Margaret?<br> Jim.<br> Jim. Jim, wake up.<br> It's 1:00. Why did you let me sleep?<br> I only meant to close my eyes<br> for five minutes.<br> - You passed out on high spirits.<br> - But you promised to take me out.<br> Take it easy. If you'd gone out,<br> you'd have run into a lot of people.<br> What's wrong with people?<br> I like people.<br> Wait till tomorrow when it'll be definite.<br> Everything is definite.<br> I've told the papers, I've ordered clothes, l...<br> Are you trying to tell me I won't get this<br> picture? Who are you? What do you know?<br> This will put me back<br> where I was.<br> But why couldn't you have waited<br> one more day? What impelled you?<br> lmpelled? Why...<br> Why, I...<br> Was I impelled?<br> You went out on a limb.<br> Yes, I did, didn't I?<br> It's probably all right.<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe I thought<br> if I made those promises...<br> ...if I got myself involved...<br> ...if I went out on that limb...<br> ...it would be so<br> because I'd said it was so.<br> And then God couldn't be so cruel<br> as to...<br> To saw me down.<br> Do you suppose that was it?<br> Margaret...<br> Why do you keep torturing yourself<br> with all this?<br> You must know by now<br> you could stay here with me.<br> - Mr. Stone?<br> - Yes?<br> - Mr. Morrison wants you in his office now.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You heard. Can't keep Joe waiting.<br> - I'll have them run it for you later.<br> Won't you wait?<br> I'll be a few minutes.<br> - I'll want to see it again anyway.<br> - All right.<br> - Operator?<br> - Yes, Miss Elliot?<br> - Is my test ready?<br> - Yes, Miss Elliot.<br> You can go ahead.<br> Action.<br> Who is it?<br> Aren't you gonna ask me to sit down?<br> You can do anything you like.<br> It isn't like you to pay a social visit,<br> Jed Garfield.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - You got it fixed real nice, Sarah.<br> - Real nice.<br> - I like things nice.<br> What do you want?<br> You used to be quite a girl.<br> You still think you are, don't you?<br> I still know what's right from wrong.<br> Do you think it right to tell folks you seen<br> him in the lane the night of the murder?<br> You know I was there.<br> - Run it again, will you?<br> - Yes, Miss Elliot.<br> I like things nice.<br> What do you want?<br> You used to be quite a girl.<br> You still think you are, don't you?<br> I still know what's right from wrong.<br> Do you think it right to tell folks you seen<br> him in the lane the night of the murder...<br> ... when you know<br> he wasn't within 30 miles?<br> I was there, Jed Garfield.<br> You know I was there.<br> It's horrible! It's horrible!<br> But if you was there,<br> what was you doing there?<br> None of your business<br> what I was doing there.<br> Disregard stage directions,<br> disregard everything.<br> Jim told you.<br> Maybe I was thinking<br> of what he tried to do to me.<br> Well, he let you keep<br> this little piece of land.<br> - He could take it away.<br> - No, Lance wouldn't do that to me.<br> Shut up!<br> Shut up! You don't know anything!<br> You don't know how well<br> I know your brother.<br> Phyll?<br> Yes, Harry?<br> Phyllis, Maggie isn't feeling well.<br> Will you put her to bed,<br> tell Robert to bring her a tray?<br> I'm sorry, Maggie.<br> Let's see. I'll put her in Judy's room.<br> She's out in Palos Verdes for the weekend.<br> What's wrong with the guestroom?<br> I think she'll be quieter in Judy's room.<br> - Do you know where Mrs. Stone is, sir?<br> - She's upstairs.<br> The caterers would like to know<br> approximately when we'll start serving.<br> - Good grief.<br> - I'll be with you in a minute.<br> - The party. It went straight out of my mind.<br> - No problem. She'll be all right up there.<br> - I gave her a sleeping pill.<br> - You didn't leave any around?<br> What happened?<br> Well...<br> She was testing for the part<br> of the older sister.<br> She got it into her head that if she<br> played it sexy and tried to look young...<br> ...they'd give her the other part.<br> Joe said that she was hopeless,<br> just bad, bad.<br> - Come on inside and meet her.<br> - Well, really I shouldn't.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> Thank you.<br> - I'm glad you came down.<br> - Dear, I've got to go.<br> - Stay for the party.<br> - I just couldn't.<br> It'll do you good.<br> Who knows? We've got a lot<br> of Hollywood brass here tonight.<br> Here's an old friend of yours.<br> Didn't Dave write a song for you once?<br> Hi, Margaret.<br> Remember?<br> Remember?<br> - Do I?<br> - Sure.<br> We did this for Night Club.<br> You know, I can still see it...<br> ...you standing there<br> in that black sequined dress...<br> ...your heart breaking<br> because the Mob had your guy.<br> - Hi, Margaret.<br> - Hi.<br> - How are you feeling?<br> - Fine, fine.<br> - Congratulations, Ethel, if it's true.<br> - What did you hear?<br> - That you got the part in The Fatal Winter.<br> - Morrison sent for me out of the blue.<br> Now I can get that tired old diamond clip<br> out of hock again.<br> Wonderful.<br> Well, Barbara Lawrence!<br> How did the preview go?<br> Terrific. Wonderful.<br> The audience loved it.<br> I signed a million autographs<br> by actual count.<br> They wouldn't let me go.<br> - That's quite a face.<br> - Who?<br> Margaret Elliot?<br> Margaret, my dear girl,<br> it's so good to see you again.<br> Harry, I own a wonderful screenplay<br> that she'd be great in.<br> You do?<br> That might save her life.<br> You realize he directed it all<br> with only a megaphone.<br> Margaret has faced some facts today.<br> Come on, let's talk to her now.<br> Thousands of extras.<br> And when the Red Sea parted...<br> Hold the Red Sea, R.J. Excuse me.<br> I don't think you know<br> Richard Stanley.<br> - No. Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - R.J., you know Dick.<br> - How do you do?<br> Margaret, Mr. Stanley<br> would like to talk to you.<br> Let's find someplace<br> where we can hear ourselves.<br> Business, you know, R.J.<br> I wanted to talk to you about a script<br> I thought you might be interested in.<br> It's a Hollywood story,<br> but it might have happened anywhere.<br> The woman could be<br> the head of a department store...<br> ...the publisher of a newspaper,<br> a politician...<br> ...anything that generates drive.<br> Now, in my script,<br> she happens to be a movie star...<br> ...so we can take advantage<br> of the bizarre atmosphere.<br> She's been on a sleigh ride,<br> but she can't face the fact...<br> ...that it's over,<br> like half the people in this town.<br> How do you mean that?<br> Well, I'm not talking about<br> your dedicated artists.<br> Theirs is another problem.<br> This is your simon-pure movie star...<br> ...like the ones that play it<br> ...thinking of themselves<br> and what they look like...<br> ...what kind of an impression<br> they're making.<br> Demanding, driving, ambitious.<br> For what?<br> Power, to stay on top.<br> And like all climbers that have reached<br> such a precarious pinnacle...<br> ...they can't look down, lest they fall.<br> So they stand, clutching what they have...<br> ...with fear, their lonely companion.<br> That's the character of the heroine,<br> if you can call her that, of Falling Star.<br> How do you get any sympathy for her?<br> Not sympathy, Miss Elliot, pity.<br> Profound pity, worthy of the gods.<br> This is a great tragedy.<br> Why, my character's denied<br> her birthright...<br> ...the privilege and the glory...<br> ...of just being a woman.<br> Gretchen, hurry.<br> Jim!<br> Come on.<br> Jim!<br> Oh, Jim.<br>
