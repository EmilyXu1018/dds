                        Let's see what you got.<br> I need more runners.<br> I can't write the business fast enough.<br> You've got to see Granger.<br> Yeah. Hold it a minute. Beat it, Mottola!<br> Mr. Granger? Chicago's on the line.<br> This is Combs. Why haven't you called?<br> Everyone else is in.<br> We had problems<br> with the law this morning.<br> The mayor promised<br> to get tough on the rackets.<br> He shut everybody down<br> for two hours to make it look good.<br> Nothing serious. It just puts us behind.<br> Been making your payoffs?<br> Yes! He does this every year.<br> There's nothing to worry about.<br> Finish your count and get it up here.<br> I don't want to be here all night.<br> The man's going to be real happy.<br> We cleared over $10,000 this week.<br> - We cleared $22,000 here.<br> - You got the whole Chicago South Side.<br> How do you expect my eight lousy spots<br> to compete with that?<br> They did $14,000 in Evanston,<br> $16,500 in Gary and $20,000 in Cicero.<br> Looks like you're bringing up the rear.<br> I just got the count.<br> I'll put the take on the 4:15.<br> We'll be waiting.<br> Mottola!<br> Take this up to Chicago on the 4:15.<br> They'll be waiting for it<br> at the clearinghouse.<br> And don't stop for any entertainment.<br> Get a cab over on Seventh.<br> Cut it out!<br> Hey, you there! Stop!<br> Hey, you! Stop that man!<br> Stop him! He's got my wallet!<br> Stop him! Stop that man!<br> He's got all of my money!<br> Stop him!<br> Goddamn nigger-lover!<br> I'll get you someday for this! Sucker egg!<br> Don't let him get away!<br> He's got my wallet!<br> He's got all my money!<br> - My wallet! He's got my wallet!<br> - We got it!<br> What happened?<br> Did he get you with the knife?<br> - You need a doctor. I'll call a cop.<br> - No, no! No cops!<br> - You wanted by the law?<br> - No, it's okay.<br> Are you nuts, carrying a wad like that<br> in this neighborhood?<br> Thanks. I'm obliged to you.<br> I've got to get going.<br> You ain't going nowhere on this leg.<br> I've got to. Got to run some slots<br> in West Bend for a mob here.<br> I got a little behind in the payoffs.<br> They think I've been holding out on them.<br> They gave me until 4:00<br> to come up with the cash.<br> If they don't get it, I'm dead.<br> It don't look good, Gramps.<br> It's almost 4:00 now.<br> I'll give you and your friend $100<br> to deliver it for me.<br> I don't know.<br> The mug that hit you is mad at me.<br> What if he's waiting around the corner?<br> He won't know you're carrying it.<br> You've got to help me.<br> I'm sorry. I'll help you get to a doctor, but<br> I ain't about to walk into no knife for you.<br> How about you? All you got to do<br> is put it in the door slot.<br> - I'll give you the whole $100.<br> - What makes you think you can trust him?<br> Butt out! I gave him back the wallet.<br> How far is this place?<br> You won't have no trouble.<br> There's $5,000 there...<br> ...and here's $100 for you.<br> Okay, I'll make your drop for you.<br> And don't worry, you can trust me.<br> If those goons search you,<br> you won't get far carrying it there.<br> - What'll we do?<br> - You got a bag or something?<br> How about a handkerchief?<br> - Here's a handkerchief!<br> - Give it to me.<br> - Give me the money.<br> - Just hurry, will you?<br> You got any more? Better give it all to me<br> if you want to keep it.<br> They think I've been holding out.<br> My wife got sick and I had to pay the bill.<br> Stuff it down your pants here.<br> Like that. Got it?<br> Hurry, will you?<br> Ain't a tough guy in the world<br> that will frisk you there.<br> Thanks.<br> Where to?<br> - Which way is Mason?<br> - Twenty blocks south.<br> - Go north, Joliet Station, fast!<br> - Right.<br> What's so funny?<br> I just made the world's easiest $5,000!<br> - Come on, Luther! Come on!<br> - Hold on, man!<br> Hustle!<br> In here!<br> Man, was that beautiful!<br> I thought for sure he was on to us.<br> No, you had him all the way. All the way!<br> Good God! We're millionaires.<br> - Did you know he was that loaded?<br> - Hell, no!<br> I just cut into him. I would've settled<br> for pawning one of them shoes.<br> Oh, God!<br> Let's get out of here.<br> We'll split it up tonight.<br> Hiya, Marge!<br> - Hi, kid.<br> - Hi, Hooker. She's on stage.<br> Hi, Hooker. Getting married or something?<br> Get used to it, Leonard.<br> I'm going to look this good from now on.<br> - What do you say, Ed?<br> - Hi, Hooker.<br> Are you getting married or something?<br> For Christ's sake, did you hear that?<br> Harry drops four beats<br> in the middle of my goddamn routine!<br> - How long do I have to put up with that?<br> - Leonard, you're on.<br> You want to get out of here tonight?<br> I got some dough.<br> I can't. I got a 10:00 show. I need the $5.<br> I'll spend $50 on you.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> ...opens up his pants,<br> the duck sticks his head out.<br> One lady says to the other,<br> "See what I see?"<br> She says, "So what?<br> You've seen one, you've seen them all."<br> She says, "Yes, but this one<br> is eating my popcorn."<br> You see that guy Harry, he can't keep time.<br> Supposing there's<br> some Hollywood movie agent out there.<br> All those years of training<br> right down the drain.<br> Ain't seen you in months.<br> Thought you took a fall.<br> Just a little hard times.<br> Everything's jake now.<br> How about a ten spot on the line?<br> There's a lot of action there on 28th Street.<br> Pay you $35.<br> $3,000 on the red.<br> - $3,000?<br> - Are you nuts?<br> No, I feel lucky.<br> Hooker, I can't accept that.<br> It's too big a bet.<br> - There's a house limit.<br> - Take it.<br> - But Hooker here...<br> - Take it!<br> Twenty-two, black.<br> Tough luck, kid.<br> Lucky for me it came up black.<br> A fella could get in trouble here,<br> losing a bet like that.<br> Listen, Jimmy, can't we do it again?<br> Don't worry about it. There's always more<br> where that came from.<br> "Don't worry about it," he says. $3,000!<br> Thanks, Hooker.<br> Comes in here with $50<br> he's going to spend on me!<br> - Thanks for the evening.<br> - It's not over yet.<br> Next time you want to spend $50<br> on me, mail it.<br> They found Mottola drunk in a dive<br> in Joliet. He never got on the train.<br> I don't want to hear about his day.<br> What happened to the money?<br> He lost it to a couple of con artists<br> on his way out of the spot.<br> - How much?<br> - $11,000.<br> I better get on the phone to New York...<br> ...see what the big mick<br> wants to do about it.<br> I have a pretty good idea, though.<br> - Doyle, can I talk to you?<br> - I'm busy, Floyd.<br> It's important. We had a little trouble<br> in Chicago today.<br> One of our runners got hit for $11,000.<br> What makes you think<br> he just didn't pocket it?<br> We checked his story with a tipster.<br> He was cleaned by two grifters.<br> They working for anybody?<br> I don't know. Could be.<br> We're running that down now.<br> Have some local people take care of them.<br> Nothing fancy.<br> We've got to discourage this kind of thing.<br> You follow?<br> Johnny Hooker!<br> - If you ain't a sharper in them linens!<br> - 'Evening, Louise.<br> Hey, Ma!<br> If I didn't know you better,<br> I'd swear you had some class.<br> Luther said you was something<br> to see today!<br> I don't know, Alva.<br> I got to get faster tying that bundle.<br> I still give them too much time to think.<br> Bushwah! I used to make that switch<br> with slower hands than you got.<br> 'Course, the Up and Down Broadway<br> was my best game.<br> Me and Luther didn't make much on it,<br> but it wasn't so touchy.<br> Them marks can beat you up bad<br> when they catch you making that switch.<br> Come on, Leroy. We'll be late for church.<br> Ma, they were closing in<br> on Machine Gun Kelly!<br> Who you rooting for anyhow?<br> - Hey, Hooker!<br> - Can't help you, Leroy.<br> - You can't beat the house.<br> - Nuts!<br> - Since when do you go to church at night?<br> - Since they started late bingo.<br> I'll ask the Lord for some of that cash<br> while He's still paying off.<br> Luther, look in on the baby<br> from time to time, will you?<br> - You too, Louise?<br> - Child, yeah, got to go pray. See you.<br> Hey, Erie.<br> - Gimme! Gimme, gimme!<br> - There's your cut.<br> Guy turned out to be an oil well.<br> - Which way'd he go?<br> - Due north. He was gonna take it all.<br> The bastard.<br> He can blow his nose all the way.<br> There you go, Luther. Six G's.<br> - You're late. Where have you been?<br> - I had a couple of appointments.<br> How much did you lose?<br> - All of it.<br> - In one goddamn night?<br> Why are you spraying money<br> around like that?<br> - You could've been nailed!<br> - There were no dicks there.<br> But you're a con man,<br> and you blew it like a pimp!<br> - Didn't I teach you to be no pimp.<br> - What's eating you?<br> I've blown money before.<br> - No class grifter would've done it.<br> - You think my play is bad?<br> I think you're the best.<br> I wouldn't be getting out, otherwise.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I'm getting too old for this racket.<br> You hang on too long<br> and you start embarrassing yourself.<br> We just took off on the biggest score ever.<br> It's nothing compared to what<br> you could make on the big con.<br> But you played the big con.<br> You told me yourself it was some<br> dumb game for mama's boys and flakes.<br> Hell, I never played no big con.<br> I hung around and picked up a few things.<br> Ain't no rich boys gonna trust<br> a hungry nigger enough to be conned.<br> But I'll tell you...<br> ...I've been looking for this one<br> all my life, Johnny.<br> Now I have a chance<br> to step out when I'm ahead.<br> Come on!<br> What would you do with yourself?<br> I have a brother in K.C.,<br> runs a freight outlet.<br> I can go halfsies with him.<br> It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.<br> I got an old friend in Chicago<br> named Henry Gondorff.<br> I want you to look him up.<br> There ain't a better inside man alive.<br> - He'll teach you all you got to know.<br> - To hell with that.<br> I want to work with you.<br> I'm out, Johnny.<br> Yeah, sure. If that's the way you want it.<br> That's the way I want it.<br> How do you like that Coleman?<br> After five years.<br> - He knew he was holding you back.<br> - Yeah, but we were partners.<br> If it weren't for Luther,<br> I'd still be hustling pinball.<br> I don't need more than what I got.<br> You won't have anything<br> if you don't lay off the games of chance.<br> - There's a depression on.<br> - There's always a depression on.<br> If you saved a little,<br> you wouldn't have to grift.<br> - I like grifting.<br> - You could buy yourself some things.<br> - What?<br> - New clothes, a car.<br> I got clothes,<br> and I don't know how to drive.<br> What else do you got to sell?<br> Hey, Hooker! Come on, you son of a...<br> Hi there, Snyder.<br> What's the matter? Things a little slow<br> down at the bunco department?<br> Somebody lose at dominoes?<br> You scored blood money today,<br> and you need a friend.<br> Go find yourself a shoplifter to roll.<br> You got the wrong guy, pal.<br> I've been home with the flu all day.<br> - Stake out my toilet if you want.<br> - Keep talking!<br> I'll tell you what you did, smart boy.<br> You tied into a loaded mark<br> on 47th across from Maxie's.<br> You and Coleman played the switch<br> for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.<br> If he hadn't been a numbers runner for<br> Doyle Lonnegan, it would've been perfect.<br> You're crazy.<br> I ain't stupid enough<br> to play for no racket's money.<br> Not intentionally, maybe.<br> That don't cut no ice with Lonnegan.<br> - He'll swat you like a fly.<br> - Yeah, well...<br> ...I'll square it with the fixer.<br> Nobody can buy you a prayer<br> if I put the finger on you.<br> Now, I figure your end of the score<br> was at least three G's.<br> - I want two, no matter what it was.<br> - My take was only one.<br> Then you'll have to come up<br> with another $1,000 somewhere.<br> All right.<br> You're a smart egg, Hooker.<br> No sense getting dead over $2,000.<br> Relax, Erie. I'll bill you.<br> - I thought you blew all your money.<br> - I did.<br> I gave him counterfeit. They'll spot it<br> the first place he tries to spend it.<br> Are you crazy,<br> giving him counterfeit money?<br> Wait up! Where you going?<br> What the hell are you gonna do<br> if Snyder puts the finger on you?<br> - You're committing suicide, kid.<br> - What's the difference?<br> If Snyder knows, so does everybody else.<br> He never gets anything first.<br> Hey, listen to me.<br> Don't go back to your place tonight.<br> Don't go anyplace you usually go.<br> You hear me?<br> Damn! There's no answer at Luther's.<br> Look, you better get out of town<br> or something.<br> Lady, let go!<br> - Ma'am! Ma'am!<br> - I want my nickel back for that telephone!<br> No, sir. Nobody here did.<br> - Is he dead?<br> - I don't know. There was a big fight.<br> I don't know.<br> Somebody must've pushed him.<br> - Jesus!<br> - Luther!<br> - Luther!<br> - Jesus!<br> God! No!<br> Luther!<br> What happened?<br> Who would do such a thing to you, Luther?<br> Come on! Let's get out of here.<br> Come on! If Snyder catches you here,<br> you're dead!<br> - Get out of here!<br> - Out of the way.<br> Help me! Help me!<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm looking for a guy<br> named Henry Gondorff.<br> - Do you know him?<br> - No.<br> You sure?<br> Beat it.<br> Luther Coleman sent me.<br> - Are you Hooker?<br> - Yeah.<br> Why didn't you say so?<br> We heard about Luther last night.<br> Come on.<br> I thought maybe you were a cop<br> or something.<br> It's the room in the back.<br> He wasn't expecting you so soon, though.<br> Thanks.<br> The great Henry Gondorff.<br> Turn it off!<br> Are you sober?<br> Turn it off, will you?<br> Glad to meet you, kid.<br> You're a real horse's ass.<br> Luther said I could learn<br> something from you.<br> I already know how to drink.<br> Sorry about Luther.<br> He was the best street worker I ever saw.<br> He had you down as a big-timer.<br> What happened?<br> I conned a senator from Florida<br> on a stock deal.<br> A real lop-ear. Thought he was gonna<br> take over General Electric.<br> Some chanteuse woke him, though,<br> and he put the feds on me.<br> You mean you blew it.<br> Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.<br> He didn't tell me you was a screw-up either.<br> You played any big cons since then?<br> I lammed around a bunch of bohunk towns,<br> one kick ahead of the G-men.<br> Would be still,<br> if Billie hadn't set me up here.<br> Don't kid yourself, friend. I still know how.<br> Are you going to stay for breakfast,<br> or do you already know how to eat?<br> I picked something up along the way.<br> Is Lonnegan after you too?<br> I don't know. I ain't seen anybody.<br> You never do, kid.<br> Doyle?<br> Yeah.<br> We just talked to Chicago.<br> They got one of the grifters last night.<br> A nigger.<br> - How about the other one?<br> - They're still looking for him.<br> - Who did Combs put on it?<br> - He gave it to Riley and Cole.<br> They staked out the other guy's place<br> last night, but he never showed.<br> They figure maybe he skipped town.<br> Do you want to keep after him?<br> You see that fella in the red sweater?<br> His name's Danny McCoy.<br> Works a few of the protection rackets<br> when he's waiting for something better.<br> Danny and I have known each other<br> since we were six.<br> Take a good look at that face, Floyd.<br> Because if he ever finds out<br> I can be beat by one lousy grifter...<br> ...I'll have to kill him and every hood...<br> ...who wants to muscle in<br> on my Chicago operation.<br> - You follow?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Good lad.<br> You feeling all right this morning, Henry?<br> Yeah, fine.<br> You mind opening up the round<br> a little early today?<br> We got some business<br> coming in before hours.<br> - Sure.<br> - Check the main gearing, will you?<br> Man O' War started rattling yesterday<br> and threw a kid on its head.<br> Great little countess, that Billie.<br> She runs a spiffy house up there too.<br> You plan to spend<br> the rest of your life here?<br> I could do a lot worse.<br> Listen, am I gonna learn to play<br> the big con or not?<br> - What's your hurry?<br> - I want to play for Lonnegan.<br> You know anything about the guy?<br> Yeah, he croaked Luther.<br> Anything else I got to know?<br> All right.<br> He runs a numbers racket on the South<br> Side, owns a packinghouse, a few banks...<br> Yeah, and half the politicians<br> in New York and Chicago.<br> Not a fix in this world will cool him out<br> if he blows on you.<br> - I'll get him anyway.<br> - Why?<br> 'Cause I don't know enough<br> about killing to kill him.<br> You can't do it alone, you know.<br> It takes some guys and money<br> to make them look good.<br> - I know lots of guys.<br> - It's not like playing winos.<br> - You can't outrun Lonnegan.<br> - I don't play for winos.<br> You've got to keep his con<br> after you take his money.<br> - He can't know you took him.<br> - You're scared of him.<br> Right down to my socks, buster.<br> This guy would kill a grifter...<br> ...over a chunk of money that<br> wouldn't support him for two days.<br> You're going to go for him.<br> I don't want a hothead looking to get even,<br> coming back saying...<br> ..."It ain't enough."<br> 'Cause it's all we're gonna get.<br> Can you get a mob together?<br> After what happened to Luther,<br> I can't get more than 300 guys.<br> Luther said you learn fast.<br> I hope he's right.<br> Lonnegan gets most of his income<br> from the numbers...<br> ...but he's putting more money<br> in his savings-and-loan business.<br> - Think he's moving out of the racket?<br> - No.<br> He owns most of the stock and it's traded.<br> My guess is he's just trying<br> to build himself a respectable image.<br> He came out of Five Points...<br> ...but he's telling everybody<br> he was born in Forest Hills.<br> He knows the market, though.<br> I don't think we can take him<br> on a stocks deal.<br> What about the numbers?<br> It's run out of a packinghouse on 14th<br> by a guy named Combs.<br> Lonnegan comes out every three weeks<br> to check on it, but...<br> ...he stays away from the day-to-day stuff<br> in case it's raided.<br> These are two of Combs'<br> favorite torpedoes: Riley and Cole.<br> You ever seen them?<br> - No.<br> - They're the ones who hit Luther.<br> They also got the numbers runner<br> you conned.<br> A guy named Mottola. Found him<br> in a quarry with a knife in his eye.<br> Lonnegan's had seven or eight people<br> rubbed on his way up.<br> His pattern is to get close to a racket boss,<br> learn the operation, then move in on it.<br> He's done it to Gorman,<br> O'Donnell, Buchalman.<br> He took the numbers from Sharkey.<br> All four of these guys are dead.<br> He's vindictive as hell, Henry.<br> Kills for pride. Doesn't add up<br> he'd let Hooker get away from him.<br> You see anything, kid, you let us know.<br> If they put you on the spot,<br> we got to fold the con. You got that?<br> Yeah. You sure it's got to be<br> one of these two guys?<br> No. They're just the only ones we know of.<br> Time.<br> Set me up five more beers,<br> will you, Danny?<br> - You the owner here?<br> - That's right.<br> Lt. Snyder, Bunco.<br> That's a Joliet badge, Snyder.<br> Don't cut much up here.<br> Looking for a guy on the lam<br> for counterfeiting.<br> - Thought he might be here.<br> - Don't think so.<br> I know everyone in the place.<br> I bounce the lamsters.<br> All right if I look around in here?<br> No, but you're welcome<br> to a free beer before you go.<br> I don't really need your permission.<br> I don't know what to do with this guy.<br> He's an Irishman who doesn't drink,<br> doesn't smoke and doesn't chase dames.<br> He's a grand knight<br> in the Knights of Columbus.<br> He only goes out to play faro.<br> Sometimes plays 20 hours at a time.<br> Just him against the house.<br> - Roulette, craps?<br> - He won't touch them.<br> The croupier at Gilman's says<br> he never plays anything he can't win.<br> Sports?<br> He likes to be seen with fighters,<br> but doesn't go to the fights or bet on them.<br> Jesus. Does he do anything<br> where he's not alone?<br> Just poker.<br> And he cheats.<br> Pretty good at it, too.<br> Where does he play?<br> The porters say he runs a braced game<br> on the Century Limited...<br> ...when he comes here from New York.<br> $100 minimum, straight poker.<br> A lot of high rollers ride that train<br> just to play him.<br> That sounds good, J.J.<br> Which way are the rooms?<br> Who told you this guy was in here?<br> Nobody. I just know<br> what kind of woman he likes.<br> I'm gonna check all the joy houses<br> till I find him.<br> Maybe I could help you<br> if you tell me his name.<br> I doubt it. Which way are the rooms?<br> Right through there.<br> But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.<br> - What are you gonna do, call the cops?<br> - I don't have to.<br> You'd be busting in<br> on the chief of police just up the hall.<br> We'll play it out here.<br> A huge duke is too simple.<br> With no fix, we'll need a con<br> with a sure-fire blow-off.<br> I think we ought to play this guy<br> on the payoff.<br> It's the tightest game we got.<br> It's not all over the papers yet.<br> Lonnegan is a fast egg. He's not going<br> to sit still for a standard play.<br> What does that leave us?<br> We can't con the payoff to a banker.<br> We'll use the wire.<br> Haven't known a player<br> didn't wanna beat the ponies.<br> - The wire's been out of date for ten years.<br> - That's why he won't know it.<br> I'm not sure I know it.<br> It'll take two of us working the inside.<br> Any objections to Hooker as second man?<br> All right. We'll give Lonnegan the hook<br> on the train and play him here.<br> Do you think I can get in that poker game?<br> Just show up with a lot of money<br> and look like a sucker.<br> I also gotta win.<br> By the way, any of you guys<br> been passing bad money lately?<br> If he comes again,<br> stall him so I can get a look at him.<br> Fella named Stenner had this place<br> until about six months ago...<br> ...but he had to give it up.<br> It doesn't look so good,<br> but maybe you can fix it up a little bit.<br> Watch your step when you come in.<br> There's a dip down to the left.<br> - How does it look, Eddie?<br> - It looks all right, Kid.<br> - It's big enough, and it's off the street.<br> - I don't know.<br> It's kind of short notice. I'm not sure<br> we can get it done by Saturday.<br> Got to. Gondorff's riding the mark down<br> from New York on the Century.<br> We'll take it. Do you manage that building<br> at the end of the alley?<br> - For 15 years.<br> - I'll need a corner room facing this way.<br> - How much a week?<br> - Only rents by the month.<br> $250 for the two of them.<br> - Last time I expect to see you down here.<br> - Never heard of the place.<br> It's been a while<br> since I stocked the wire store.<br> Not many mobs playing that anymore.<br> All we'll need is the bookie setup for now.<br> I'll rent you everything<br> I got in the warehouse for $2,000.<br> That'll give you phones, cages,<br> blackboards and ticker gear.<br> If you want a counter and bar,<br> that's another $1,000.<br> - That's pretty steep, Benny.<br> - Gondorff's still a hot item.<br> - Where would I be if he gets hit?<br> - Just give us what you can.<br> We'll send a truck.<br> How do you want to work this?<br> Flat rate or percentage?<br> - Who's the mark?<br> - Doyle Lonnegan.<br> Flat rate.<br> The guy in the black hat with the gimp.<br> He's not as tough as he thinks.<br> Neither are we.<br> - Mr. Shaw?<br> - Right.<br> You wanted to see me?<br> I hear there's a friendly poker game<br> on this train. Know about it?<br> - A little.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Can you get me in that game?<br> - I don't know.<br> There's usually a waiting list.<br> That'll get you first alternate, sir.<br> I'll see what I can do.<br> Twist!<br> - Patty, me boy!

Here.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Don't mention it, ma'am.<br> She picked him clean. He never missed it.<br> My God, it looks like<br> he's expecting a big night.<br> Must be $15,000-$20,000 here.<br> - He's waiting for you in the card room.<br> - Let him wait.<br> Just worry about your end, kid.<br> If we ever get to it.<br> Excuse me.<br> You sure you checked this guy out?<br> He seemed like a pleasant man,<br> a lot of cash on him.<br> $200 suit, expensive luggage.<br> I'll vouch for him.<br> - Why isn't he here then?<br> - Don't worry. He'll be here.<br> All right.<br> What're you doing?<br> Always drink gin with a mark, kid.<br> He can't tell if you cut it.<br> - $2,000 for you, Mr. Clayton.<br> - Thank you.<br> All right, gentlemen.<br> Should we not wait for him?<br> - Let's go.<br> - I think that's a good idea.<br> Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.<br> Sorry I'm late, guys.

Shaw sent me.<br> Your boss is quite a card player, Mr. Kelly.<br> How does he do it?<br> He cheats.<br> In that case, I'll keep my money,<br> and we'll have another game.<br> You don't have any to keep.<br> Here's your wallet.<br> He hired a dame to take it from you.<br> He's been planning<br> to beat your game for months.<br> He's been waiting for you to cheat him<br> so he could clip you.<br> Who do you think you're talking to?<br> Nobody sets me up!<br> Take him back to the baggage room!<br> Put one in his ear!<br> There were four witnesses at that table!<br> Then get that other son of a bitch<br> and dump them in the first tunnel.<br> We'll be in the station in a few minutes!<br> It ain't gonna look too good<br> killing a guy you owe money to.<br> There's better ways of taking him down.<br> What do you think Shaw would do to me<br> if he knew I was telling you this?<br> Okay.<br> Why the rat?<br> I want to take over his operation,<br> and I need you to help me break him.<br> - Where's my money?<br> - Shaw's got it.<br> How the hell could I ask him for it back?<br> We're pulling in.<br> I'm giving you a lift home.<br> - I was supposed to go with Shaw.<br> - Explain it to him somehow.<br> - But he's expecting me.<br> - I'm giving you a lift home.<br> You follow?<br> Yeah, sure. Sure thing.<br> - Why do you think you can beat him?<br> - I've been planning this for two years.<br> I know his organization<br> backwards and forwards.<br> I need somebody who's respectable<br> but not legit.<br> I'm a banker. That's legit in this state.<br> Just put down a bet for me<br> at Shaw's place.<br> I'll do the rest. I'll supply the money.<br> I'll supply the information.<br> What about the money<br> you come to collect?<br> I'll tell him you paid it.<br> I keep his books. He trusts me.<br> If you help me, I'll pay back the money<br> he stole out of my own pocket.<br> - It's worth that much to you?<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, yeah. Maybe a couple of million.<br> Where do you come from, Kelly?<br> From the east side of New York.<br> A place called Five Points.<br> - But I got out of there.<br> - Out and up, huh?<br> I'll have to keep you away from this guy.<br> You're liable to get ideas.<br> I'll be at Klein's Drug Store...<br> ...660 South Marshall at 1:30,<br> if you're interested.<br> If I'm not there by 1:45, I'm not coming.<br> Hey, Hooker, how did it go?<br> Jake.<br> - Everything go okay?<br> - Yeah, sure. Hell, easy.<br> - No sign of trouble?<br> - No.<br> - What about Lonnegan?<br> - I gave him the breakdown.<br> - And?<br> - He's good. He threatened to kill me.<br> If they don't do that,<br> you know you're not getting to them.<br> Hello, Doyle.<br> All right, Riley, what the hell happened?<br> We missed him.<br> Whoever he is, he made a fool out of you.<br> There was no way he could've known<br> we was in that room.<br> - Somebody must've wised him up.<br> - What does Cole say about that?<br> - I don't know. He took it hard.<br> - Get out of here, Riley.<br> Put Salino onto it.<br> Salino? Why waste our best people<br> on a small-time job?<br> This is a nickel-and-dime grifter<br> we're after.<br> - They'll get him.<br> - They had their chance.<br> All they did was shoot up a neighborhood,<br> wake up a few cops.<br> - But that was...<br> - I told you to put Salino onto it.<br> It may take a little more time,<br> but there won't be any holes.<br> Tell Cole I wanna see him<br> when he comes in.<br> He won't be coming in,<br> not to get bounced off a job, anyway.<br> This is Salino's job, Vince.<br> Cole wants to muscle in,<br> that's his business.<br> He's breaking the rules<br> and Salino won't like it.<br> Now, get me the books.<br> Those odds on the third race are wrong.<br> Just a minute. I'll get them.<br> Don't worry so much.<br> You're gonna be all right.<br> Just stay to the back the first time around.<br> Put a little of this on your nose.<br> Kelly?<br> You should always look to the back, kid.<br> I was afraid you wouldn't show.<br> We don't have much time.<br> Get on with it, then.<br> Sometime after 2:00...<br> ...a guy's gonna call on that phone<br> and give you the name of a horse.<br> All you got to do<br> is take this $2,000 across the street...<br> ...to Shaw's place, and bet it on that pony.<br> There's nothing to it.<br> Don't take too much time. We've only got<br> four minutes after you get the call.<br> You'll not break him with a $2,000 bet.<br> This is just a test.<br> The big one comes later.<br> Be careful with that. That's all I got.<br> You were gonna pay me back<br> out of your own pocket?<br> I am.<br> After the race.<br> I got to get back before Shaw misses me.<br> Good luck.<br> Yeah?

Just a second.<br> - Where to?<br> - 110 South Wabash.<br> What happened to your face?<br> Got into a fight with a raggle<br> down on 13th.<br> Cut me with her ring.<br> You ought to lay off the skirts.<br> You don't find any of my boys<br> messing around with that kind of trash.<br> Brigham signed it, all right.<br> I can't understand why he didn't tell me.<br> He's like all them supervisors.<br> They think they're too good<br> for regular people.<br> He says he was here<br> and the place was a mess.<br> We'll hurry so we don't keep you<br> out too long.<br> Why can't I work with you in here?<br> We got to cover the floor and the furniture,<br> so we don't spill.<br> If you want to sit in here with a tarp<br> over your head, go ahead.<br> How long will you be?<br> An hour or two at the most.<br> It's a small job.<br> We'll go in the side door here.<br> Hiya, Les.<br> Les, this is Doyle Lonnegan.<br> - Mr. Lonnegan, this is Les Harmon.<br> - How do you do?<br> What did you bring him here for?<br> I thought that he should see the operation.<br> I'm having the place painted.<br> We can't talk in here now.<br> We'll have to find someplace else.<br> Excuse me, Mr. Lonnegan.<br> Miss Barnes, I'm going home a little early.<br> If there are any calls, tell them<br> they can reach me here tomorrow morning.<br> Mr. Lonnegan?<br> I want to see it one more time.<br> I can't do it.<br> We got telegraph inspectors everywhere.<br> One more time won't make a difference.<br> We got $400,000<br> coming in from the coast next week.<br> You gonna risk that on a lousy 15 G's?<br> If it works again tomorrow,<br> I'll finance the whole thing.<br> $500,000. 60-40, we split.<br> We've already got a guy.<br> He's gonna give us half.<br> - What am I supposed to say to him?<br> - Say to him what you want.<br> Knowing your operation, if I were you...<br> ...I'd be worried about making me happy.<br> Your guy says a week.<br> How do we know it won't be a month?<br> Lonnegan's a banker. He can get<br> the money without any questions.<br> We can't keep going into Shaw's<br> and cleaning up on long shots.<br> - He's bound to get wise.<br> - All right. We'll go for short odds.<br> You follow?<br> Are you Lt. William Snyder?<br> I don't know. What's up?<br> FBI.<br> Special Agent Polk would like<br> a few words with you.<br> You got a couple of minutes?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> No. It's got to be south of the river.<br> Probably this section in here.<br> Now, that's this section here.<br> Now, let's break it<br> into two sections along 35th.<br> What the hell is this? I got work to do.<br> Sit down and shut up, will you?<br> Try not to live up to all my expectations.<br> Take two men along. Work your way south<br> from 31st to 35th, Morgan and Halsted.<br> Go into every place<br> and let me know what you find.<br> We've been told, you know a hustle artist<br> named Johnny Hooker.<br> - Do you know him?<br> - Yeah, but I don't know where he is.<br> Well, we do. He's chumming around<br> with a big C named Henry Gondorff.<br> Ring any bells?<br> Every bunco man in the country<br> knows Gondorff.<br> Well, there's word he's gonna run a con<br> on the South Side here.<br> We've got a Florida warrant on him,<br> but it's a thin beef.<br> He can beat it in court<br> unless we catch him cold.<br> All we want you to do<br> is pick up Hooker for us.<br> Why don't you pick him up yourself?<br> If word gets out the feds are in on it,<br> Gondorff will fold up the whole thing.<br> Wouldn't that be too bad?<br> Then you'd have to move out<br> of this nice office you've got here.<br> Don't crack wise with me, flatfoot.<br> I spent too much time in dumps like this<br> eating Gondorff's dust...<br> ...while you guys in the bunco squads<br> get rich tipping him off!<br> That's not gonna happen this time.<br> We're not gonna tell the police we're here.<br> You keep your mouth shut and do a job,<br> there'll be reward bucks in it for you.<br> And you better take it, 'cause<br> I can make you work for us without it.<br> What the hell good is Hooker to you?<br> He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.<br> - He'll never do it.<br> - I think he will.<br> He's there. Let's get on it.<br> What's the line on Exponent?<br> - How's it going?<br> - Nothing yet.<br> I had a good one on the lead<br> at Lincoln Fields, but he faded.<br> Best we had the last hour was Love Potion<br> at Rockingham and she was 5-1.<br> All the long shots coming in today.<br> Take 4-1 if you have to.<br> Okay.<br> You can forget the boodle, Eddie.<br> He could hit us for $15,000 at 4-1.<br> We can't handle that.<br> - Give him the shutout.<br> - Okay.<br> Okay, Billie, here we go.<br> At the wire, it's Wrecking Crew,<br> the winner by five.<br> Black Mischief, second. Whichaway, third.<br> Wrecking Crew was 3-1. That's our boy.<br> Henry?<br> Here we go. We got a 3-1 at Belmont.<br> Wrecking Crew.<br> - Yeah?<br> - In the sixth race at Belmont.<br> Wrecking Crew to win,<br> Black Mischief to place...<br> ...Whichaway to show.<br> Wait here.<br> The winner, Time to Go, paid $7...<br> ...$5.40 and $3.80.<br> Joy Flag, $6 and $4.20.<br> Readily paid $3.80 to show.<br> The weather's threatening, but the track<br> is fast in Salem, New Hampshire.<br> Here's a late jockey change<br> there in the fifth at Rockingham.<br> R.C. Stark will ride Itsie-Bitsie.<br> $5,000 on Black Mischief, across the board.<br> The sixth at Belmont.<br> Would you hurry up there, please?<br> Wrecking Crew is 3-1, Vale of Tears, 4...<br> ...Black Mischief, 5, Whichaway, 6...<br> ...Chief Yeoman, 12, Peerless Pal is 20...<br> ...and Mariato is 40.<br> And here we go for the sixth at Belmont.<br> It's five and a half furlongs.<br> They're at the post.<br> - Now.<br> - The flag is up.<br> - They're off!<br> - Belmont, $15,000.<br> Excuse me, sir. We can't take any bets<br> once the race is started.<br> You can bet on another race if you care to.<br> Going into the backstretch,<br> it's Wrecking Crew by two.<br> Whichaway a half, Black Mischief<br> and Vale of Tears riding on the outside.<br> - Nothing, thank you.<br> - What happened?<br> I didn't get the bet down in time.<br> Jesus!<br> Heading for home, it's Wrecking Crew<br> all alone by six lengths...<br> ...Whichaway a length, and Vale of Tears.<br> It's Wrecking Crew,<br> Whichaway and Black Mischief.<br> And at the wire,<br> Wrecking Crew wins it by six lengths.<br> Black Mischief is second by a head...<br> ...Whichaway is third,<br> followed by Vale of Tears.<br> You should've had your money<br> on Wrecking Crew.<br> It's raining and the track is sloppy<br> at Riverside Park.<br> There's a late scratch there.<br> Transmutate is scratched<br> in the fifth at Riverside.<br> At Belmont, the winner, Wrecking Crew...<br> ...paid $6, $4.20 and $2.80.<br> Black Mischief, $4.60 and $3.20.<br> I'll have $500,000 here<br> by post time tomorrow.<br> Lay it on a race<br> where the odds are 4-1 or better.<br> - Make sure I get to the window.<br> - How am I gonna do that?<br> I don't know.<br> Figure it out for yourself, Kelly.<br> Finished?<br> Yeah. Meat loaf, apple pie<br> and a cup of coffee.<br> - Say, what time you get off work here?<br> - 2:00 a.m.<br> - Yeah? Doing anything tonight?<br> - Yeah. Sleeping.<br> Eighty-five.<br> - Is there a back door?<br> - What's wrong with the front?<br> There's a guy out there I don't need to see.<br> Don't look around.<br> - What does he want?<br> - He'd like to kill me.<br> Do me a favor. Go into the bathroom,<br> open the window and wait there.<br> Do what I tell you,<br> and everything will be jake.<br> Please.<br> Thanks. Good night.<br> It's taken.<br> Thanks. See you.<br> Shit.<br> Salino. Hey, I wasn't...<br> Hey! Got you, Hooker!<br> - Hey there, Snyder. Long time no see.<br> - Get going!<br> Chuck...<br> ...get this to the Department right away.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hello, Hooker. Take them off.<br> Special Agent Polk, FBI.<br> Have a chair.<br> - You want a drink or something?<br> - No.<br> We want to talk to you<br> about Henry Gondorff.<br> Yeah? I don't think I know him.<br> Give yourself a couple of seconds.<br> You wouldn't want to lie to me.<br> Lt. Snyder says you've done<br> lots of confidence work in his town.<br> Oh, yeah? Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.<br> - You ain't got nothing on me.<br> - Yeah?<br> How about counterfeiting?<br> We've got a tip that Gondorff<br> is gonna run a con on the South Side here.<br> All you've got to do is tell us<br> when he's gonna play his chump.<br> We come in at the sting,<br> make the pinch, and...<br> ...you walk out free as a bird.<br> No.<br> You want to spend the next 20 years<br> in a federal penitentiary, starting tonight?<br> I'll make parole.<br> Like hell. You won't even get a review.<br> I'll chance it.<br> Okay. If that's the way you want it.<br> We might provide you with<br> a little company on your way up the river.<br> That wife of Luther Coleman's.<br> What was her name?<br> - Alva.<br> - Alva.<br> That's it. Alva Coleman.<br> Pretty fair grifter in her time.<br> Snyder's given us quite a folder on her.<br> Nothing major by itself, but...<br> ...put them all together,<br> it could add up to a lot of years.<br> - You stink, mister.<br> - Don't be a sap.<br> It's not her I want.<br> If you're too dumb to save yourself, there's<br> no sense dragging her down with you.<br> It's over, Hooker.<br> You can save me a lot of trouble.<br> But I'm gonna get Henry Gondorff<br> whether you help me out or not.<br> - You'll wait till the chump is played?<br> - Hell, yes.<br> We don't care about the mark.<br> He deserves it.<br> I mean completely played. You come in<br> before we beat him, and I'll kill him.<br> All right, Hooker.<br> But you try to take it on the lam,<br> and we'll shoot you down on sight.<br> As long as I get to finish the play.<br> What is it, kid? You're not saying much.<br> - Just got the jumps.<br> - Come in.<br> Things are a little slow.<br> I want to open the round for the girls.<br> Sure.<br> Take it easy.<br> We're not gonna lose him now.<br> We had him ten years ago<br> when he decided to be somebody.<br> Believe me,<br> I've seen enough to know. Ten.<br> - Twenty.<br> - Thirty.<br> - Go.<br> - Thirty-one.<br> How many guys you conned<br> in your life, Henry?<br> I don't know, 200, 300.<br> Sometimes we played two a day<br> when I was with O'Shea's mob.<br> Of course, Chicago was a rigged town.<br> The fix was in.<br> The dicks took their end without a beef.<br> We had it down to a business.<br> And it really stunk, kid.<br> No sense in being a grifter<br> if it's the same thing as being a citizen.<br> I got packing to do. I'm gonna be<br> a hot number again after tomorrow.<br> I wouldn't ask you to do this<br> if it weren't for Luther.<br> Nothin's gonna make up for Luther.<br> Revenge is for suckers.<br> I've been grifting 30 years. I never got any.<br> Then why're you doing it?<br> It seems worthwhile, doesn't it?<br> See you.<br> Looks like he missed you.<br> Yeah. This time, anyway.<br> Good night, Mrs. Hillard.<br> I was wondering if you might want<br> to come out for a while...<br> ...maybe have a drink or something.<br> You move right along, don't you?<br> Hey, I don't mean nothing by it.<br> I just don't know many regular girls, is all.<br> And you expect me<br> to come out just like that?<br> If I expected something,<br> I wouldn't still be standing here in the hall.<br> I don't even know you.<br> You know me. I'm just like you.<br> It's 2:00 a.m., and I don't know nobody.<br> Come on, Henry. Knock off.<br> You've done everything you can.<br> - Yeah? Polk.<br> - Polk, this is Hooker.<br> - Ready?<br> - Yeah, go ahead.<br> Everything's set.<br> There'll be a guy at the door.<br> Nobody's got heaters.<br> You won't have any trouble.<br> Okay. See you there.<br> She was gonna kill you, kid.<br> Her name's Loretta Salino.<br> Lonnegan's people set her up in the diner.<br> Come on.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> Come on!<br> Come on!<br> She could have killed me last night.<br> Too many people could have seen you.<br> She was a real professional.<br> Used to work in the Dutch Schultz mob.<br> Who are you?<br> Gondorff asked me to look after you.<br> We just got a tip that Gondorff's mark<br> is some big New York wheel.<br> As soon as we're inside,<br> you get him out of there fast...<br> ...before the reporters show up.<br> I don't want any big shots around<br> to mess this up for me.<br> All right, let's go!<br> Let's go, guys!<br> The flag is up, kid.<br> - Anytime, J.J.<br> - I'm working on it.<br> We got one, Billie. Here we go.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Place it on Lucky Dan...<br> ...third race at Riverside Park.<br> ...One minute 11 and three-fifths seconds.<br> They were off at 21.<br> Last call on the third at Riverside Park.<br> They're at the post.<br> At Havre De Grace,<br> the winner, Light Chatter...<br> ...paid $5.40, $3.80...<br> ...and $2.40.

Place it on Lucky...<br> That horse is gonna run second!<br> Ima Dreamer a half, Dr. Twink a half<br> and Orkin by two, followed by Little Star.<br> It's a driving finish!<br> There's been a mistake.<br> Give me my money back!<br> I tell you there's been a mistake!<br> Give me my goddamn money back!<br> All right, FBI! Don't anybody try to leave.<br> Stand on your feet, put your hands<br> over your head and move nice and slow.<br> Snyder!<br> Get them up against the wall.<br> Make sure they're not carrying anything.<br> Hello, Henry. It's been a long time.<br> But it's over.<br> Okay, kid, you can go.<br> All right, I said hands up. Keep them up!<br> Come on. Move them back! Put them up!<br> Get him out. Get him out!<br> Come on! Got to get you out of here!<br> - Come on!<br> - But my money's in there!<br> There's some dead guys too.<br> You can't get mixed up.<br> You don't understand.<br> There's $500,000 in there!<br> He's gone.<br> Okay, Henry, all clear.<br> Can you believe it? We pulled it off.<br> It's a nice con, Hickey. I thought you were<br> the feds myself when you came in.<br> No trouble, Henry.<br> Snyder went for it all the way.<br> You should've seen the rag<br> he lit under Lonnegan!<br> Well, kid, you beat him.<br> You're right, Henry. It's not enough.<br> But it's close.<br> Okay, guys, let's take this place apart fast.<br> You can pick up your splits from Eddie<br> at Boudreau's tonight.<br> Nice going, J.J.<br> Oh, Henry!<br> You're not gonna stick around<br> for your share?<br> Nah.
