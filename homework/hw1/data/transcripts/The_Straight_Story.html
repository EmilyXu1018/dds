Were waiting for|the first warm meal in ten days.<br> We...thought|we'd seen the worst.<br> We hadn't had|much trouble from the air.<br> I was on the rise...<br> ... with the quartermaster,|workin' on more coffee for me and my buddies.<br> A stray Fokker|came over the treetops...<br> and dropped|an incendiary on the mess tent.<br> All my buddies...<br> The Kraut banked right in front|of me on that hill...<br> and now I can...|see the...Swastika.<br> That is one thing|that I can't shake loose...<br> All my buddies faces|are still young.<br> And the thing is, the more years|I have, the more they've lost.<br> And it's not always buddies faces that I see,|sometime they're German faces.<br> Near the end we were shootin'|moon-faced boys.<br> I was a sniper.<br> Where I grew up, you learned|how to shoot to hunt food.<br> They'd post me up front.|Darn near ahead of the lines.<br> And I'd sit...forever.<br> It's an amazing thing what you|can see while you're sittin'.<br> I'd look for the officers, the<br> radio guys or artillery spotter.<br> Sometime I'd spot|a gun nest by the smoke<br> ... and I'd fire into it.<br> Sometime it was just|a movement in the woods.<br> We had a scout,<br> a little fella, name of Katz.<br> He was a Polish boy|from Milwaukee.<br> He'd always take recon|and he was darn good at it.<br> We went by his word and he saved|our skin many a time.<br> He was a little fella...<br> We'd broken|out of the hedgerows...<br> We were makin'|a run across the open<br> and we come upon a woods.<br> We started drawin' fire.<br> I took my usual position...<br> and I saw somethin' movin',|real slow like.<br> I waited ten minutes,|it moved again and I shot.<br> The movement stopped.<br> The next day|we found Katz...head shot.<br> He'd been workin'|his way back toward our lines.<br> Everyone in the unit thought|a German sniper had taken him...<br> Everyone, all these years.<br> Everyone but me.<br> See, Harald...brainiac...<br> Got the mower assembly free with|this here little old wrench...<br> You said it wouldn't work.|I'd say it worked pretty good.<br> Wouldn't you?<br> So help me slide her out.|We can get settled up.<br> Uh...I got parts and labour|that add up to $247.80.<br> Well, I'd say that's a little heavy for light work.|Don't you think?<br> I've got an old man's eyes,|but, ah... I'm noticin' some new tyre here.<br> Well, now...ah, we got those off a resell,|but the treads are good!<br> Well, friend, are you chargin'|me for good or for new?<br> Ahhhh...Thorvald?<br> Ahh...we can make|an adjustment there.<br> Well, I think the adjustment|should be about thirty dollars.<br> Is that what|your pencil's sayin'?<br> And, ah...about the labour...<br> I appreciate that you boys have|done some real time on this...<br> of course, a man's gotta ask|when he's workin' with twins -<br> especially a bickerin' pair -<br> -how much workin' was fightin'?|-He got that right.<br> Shut up, Danny.<br> If I was to judge by this joyous|affair I saw today,<br> I would calculate maybe 20|per cent taken off the labour.<br> Anything else, mister?<br> Well, I'm not from these parts,|but where I come from,<br> I would say that that was a|little rich for Iowa oil.<br> Take the oil, no charge.<br> Well, that's a splendid offer|and I do appreciate it.<br> What's the tally?<br> Ah...ahhh...<br> Hundred and eighty even?<br> Done.<br> Thanks to you boys, I'm gonna|get this rig back on the road.<br> I've drove it all the way across Iowa|and I'm hopin' it holds on till I get to Wisconsin.<br> My brother lives there.|I haven't seen him in ten years.<br> There's no one knows your life better|than a brother that's near your age.<br> He knows who and what you are|better than anyone on Earth.<br> My brother and I said some...|unforgivable things the last time we met,<br> but, I'm tryin' to put that behind me.<br> And this trip is a hard|swallow... of my pride,<br> I just hope I'm not too late.<br> A brother's a brother.<br> Well,... Guess I'll be turnin' in.<br> I'll, ah...see you in the|morning, then, before you go.<br> I'm gonna leave awful early.<br> I wanna thank you for your|kindness to a stranger.<br> It's been a genuine pleasure|havin' you here, Alvin.<br> Write to us, sometime.<br> I will.<br> I noticed your campfire.<br> I brought you some dinner...|Mashed potatoes, meat loaf.<br> Well, thank you kindly.|I've had my dinner, but...<br> -...would you join me for a while?|-Sure.<br> Thank you.<br> -I hope you don't mind me trespassin'.|-Oh, no, not at all.<br> Made a fine choice. You're camped next to|one of the oldest cemeteries in the Midwest.<br> French Catholic trappers.<br> -The Marquette party?|-Two of his men.<br> I couldn't help but notice|the rather unusual mode of transport.<br> Well, you're not the first|person to notice that, Padre.<br> My eyes are bad. I can't drive.<br> I don't like someone else drivin' the bus,|and I need to get to my brother's.<br> Fair enough. Where is he?<br> Well, he's so close, I can practically feel him.|Mount Zion.<br> -What's his name?|-Lyle Straight.<br> Is he that fella that came in|with a stroke some weeks ago?<br> Thats right. Do you know him?<br> I work at the hospital in Boscobel.|I remember him comin' in.<br> Caught my attention|because...he lives in my parish.<br> -Well, he's a Baptist.|-Oh, I believe he told me that.<br> Told me a few things,|matter of fact, but...<br> he didn't|mention having a brother.<br> Well, neither one of us has had|a brother for quite some time.<br> So, you saw him?|Is he all right?<br> I only saw him that once and|I haven't heard anything more.<br> Well, Lyle and I grew up|as close as brothers could be.<br> We were raised on a farm|in Moorhead, Minnesota.<br> We worked hard.<br> My mom and dad darn near killed themselves|tryin' to make that farm work.<br> And me and Lyle would|make games out of our chores.<br> We'd dream up somethin'|about racin' and wagerin'<br> do anything to keep our mind off the cold.|Lord, it was cold.<br> He and I used|to sleep out in the yard<br> every summer night,|if it wasn't pourin'.<br> Nine months of winter,|we couldn't get enough summer.<br> We'd bunk down|when the sun went down.<br> We'd talk to each other|until we went to sleep.<br> We'd talk about the stars...<br> ...and whether there might be|somebody else like us out in space,...<br> ...places we wanted to go and...<br> it made our trials seem smaller.<br> Yeah, we pretty much talked|each other through growin' up.<br> Oh, whatever happened|between you two?<br> Story as old as the Bible.|Cain and Abel.<br> Anger, vanity.<br> You mix that together|with liquor, and...<br> you've got two brothers who|haven't spoken in ten years.<br> Well, whatever it was|that made me and Lyle so mad...<br> don't matter any more.<br> I wanna make peace.|I wanna sit with him,<br> look up at the stars... like we used to do<br> so long ago.<br> I say ''Amen'' to that.<br> Howdy.<br> I haven't had a drink in a lot of years.|Now I'm gonna have me a cold beer.<br> What flavour?<br> What does|a Miller's Lite taste like?<br> There you go.<br> -How's it taste?|- It's good.<br> -Keep the change.|- Thank you.<br> It's an interesting rig you got|outside. Get up the hill OK?<br> That hill and 200 more|just like it.<br> - How far did ya come?|- From Iowa.<br> I'm headed|for Lyle Straight's place.<br> Iowa! My God,|you must be thirsty.<br> - Another beer?|- This will do me fine.<br> I wonder could you point me to Lyle's place?| I haven't seen him in an awful long time.<br> Well, you just...ah,|cross 61 here, on ''W'',<br> Take ''W'' on down to Weed Road|and then on to Remington Road.<br> On your right|will be Lyle's place.<br> If he's there that is.<br> -How you doin'...?|-Not too good.<br> This thing's just tired.<br> Is there anything|I can do to help you?<br> -Well, I don't know. It just quit on me.|-Why don't you try her again?<br> I'm headin' to Lyle Straight's place.<br> Lyle!<br> Lyle!<br> Alvin?<br> Sit down, Alvin.<br> Did you ride that thing all|the way out here to see me?<br> I did, Lyle.<br>
