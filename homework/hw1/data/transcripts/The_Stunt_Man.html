Really?<br> No, it's about fighting windmills.<br> [ Raymond ]<br> You tell him, Eli.<br> Appalling though it is,<br> war isn't the disease.<br> It's merely one of the symptoms.<br> The rooms are full,<br> the town is sold out...<br> and I just hired a second crew.<br> Eli, pray, what is the disease?<br> Ah, Sam, interesting.<br> Define the disease,<br> write me a new scene,<br> the egg will drop from my face,<br> and we shall have a relevant screenplay.<br> Maybe.<br> Ask him, for he might know.<br> Mightn't you, Lucky?<br> Tell us, how did you like Vietnam?<br> How'd you like the plague?<br> [ Scattered laughter ]<br> Were you drafted?<br> - No.<br> - There you go, Sam.<br> Another one.<br> He hates war, but he enlisted.<br> You fought for two years, actually<br> out there for two years killing people.<br> I didn't kill that many people.<br> Ah, you're modest, Lucky,<br> and there is no need, for<br> we all dig a little violence.<br> - What was that you said on the beach?<br> - About what?<br> Something about<br> being home for Thanksgiving.<br> That you, uh, you'd better<br> figure the guy comin' at you<br> is tryin' to kill you?<br> That's it.<br> Sam, perhaps that's<br> what our film is about.<br> Being scared shitless, whistling<br> in the dark, inventing enemies.<br> - Are you finished?<br> - No, I'm not finished. Does it--<br> Everybody wants to<br> take things away from me.<br> You wanna take my scene,<br> she wants to take my food.<br> - You got another scene.<br> I'll write you another scene.<br> - Thank you.<br> It won't make<br> a goddamn bit of difference.<br> Studio'll cut 'em all out anyway<br> like they do everything else.<br> All you're gonna have left<br> is a bunch of swell battle scenes,<br> which they said looked just terrific.<br> What'd they say about me?<br> I know. Never mind.<br> Take a guess. Turkey.<br> Yeah.<br> - Well, they won't cut my scenes out.<br> - No? What makes you so special?<br> Because they know that if they<br> touch my film, I'll kill them.<br> You mean, bang.<br> Kill 'em just like that.<br> No, I'll kill them,<br> and then I'll eat them.<br> [ Nina laughing ]<br> That's disgusting.<br> Waste not, want not.<br> They call him Eli the terrible.<br> Sam, this picture is my child.<br> What would you say if the studio<br> said your daughter Jennifer<br> would look better...<br> with her fingers chopped off?<br> Well,<br> being an insecure writer,<br> I'd call my agent<br> and get a second opinion.<br> [ All laughing ]<br> If you'll excuse me--<br> - Don't go away, Burt. I want you.<br> - [ Eli ] Jake.<br> What an unexpected but delightful...<br> shock.<br> I am not talkin' to you.<br> I understand you got that film<br> out of the Duesenberg.<br> It's at the lab, Jake.<br> I am talking to this gentleman.<br> I wanna see that film.<br> Tell the chief of police<br> it'll be our pleasure<br> as soon as we get it back.<br> - But ask him why.<br> - Why?<br> You can tell your Mr. Cross that this<br> inquiry comes from a source so high,<br> It is not his to question,<br> it is his to do it or else.<br> Somebody they're looking for<br> may have been on the road<br> when the car went off.<br> - Burt, you see anybody?<br> - Uh-uh.<br> Hey, was your hair always blond?<br> Yeah. She sprays it every day<br> so I'll look like Raymond.<br> Would you tell the chief of police<br> that Burt was so busy being brilliant...<br> he wouldn't have noticed sweet Jesus<br> Christ walking across the water.<br> He wouldn't have noticed.<br> Has anybody seen this man?<br> Burt, you have it upside-down.<br> The eyes go on the top.<br> Couple of telephone linemen saw<br> this guy Cameron headed this way.<br> Oh. Looks like a fine,<br> clean-cut kid.<br> [ Scoffs ] I know a lot of angry,<br> weary people who don't happen to think so.<br> Really.
