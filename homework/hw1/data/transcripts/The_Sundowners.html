He's stuck.<br> He don't sleep<br> for fear his cows will run dry...<br> ...or else he don't sleep<br> because he's up milking them.<br> Breaks his back painting the place<br> and watches the sun peel it off.<br> Worries about droughts,<br> and when the drought breaks...<br> - ... he's got floods to worry about.<br> - You do have troubles, don't you?<br> Why, you've just gone through more<br> in the last 10 seconds...<br> ...than most farmers go through<br> in 10 years.<br> Do you think those cow cockies<br> have an easy time of it?<br> Nobody has an easy time of it.<br> How do you know<br> that bloke don't lie awake...<br> ...worrying about the mortgage?<br> Do I do that?<br> Well, if you did, you'd be the first man<br> ever mortgaged a tent.<br> Oh, you're a card, Ide.<br> You're a real card.<br> I don't know why the pictures<br> didn't take you instead of Buster Keaton.<br> Well, I'll be home for dinner.<br> Darl, if you get the job...<br> ...what you gonna do<br> about an extra horse?<br> Well, I thought about<br> taking on another drover.<br> Be sure and get someone<br> we can live with.<br> We're gonna be stuck with him<br> for two or three months.<br> A clean-living teetotaler,<br> that's what I'll hire.<br> Well, you can try a little teetotaling<br> yourself, while you're at it.<br> It's all right, ain't it?<br> It's what home looks like,<br> when you have a home.<br> Reckon I'll go bag us<br> a couple of rabbits.<br> Head towards town.<br> See if you can find your dad.<br> He ought to have been back long ago.<br> He's either celebrating getting the job<br> or drowning his disappointment.<br> Come on, Ollie.<br> Get off me!<br> Get lost!<br> Ollie!

What's the matter?<br> You lost your father?<br> My old man's got the job,<br> and he's feeling too good to quit.<br> - That's him singing.<br> - Is it? I'm very sorry to hear that.<br> He has the most disagreeable voice,<br> doesn't he?<br> - Well, he likes it.<br> - Does he?<br> Now, what's he weigh?<br> - Thirteen and a half.<br> - Thirteen and a half?<br> - Fourteen.<br> - Fourteen?<br> Why?<br> I wouldn't disturb him<br> while he's singing.<br> Hold my beer, will you?<br> Oh, no. Not again. Boy!<br> Ollie, let go.<br> Get off. Get off!<br> Come on, hurry up.<br> Boy, get this man-eating mongrel<br> off me.<br> Get off. Get off.<br> Get off.

He's drunk.<br> No, he's not.<br> He's being attacked by a dog.<br> - A mad dog?<br> - Mad dog?<br> - Mad dog.<br> - Mad dog.<br> - Mad dog?<br> - Mad dog.<br> Look out, he leaning.<br> I was bitten by a mad dog once.<br> Oh, God, I was crook.<br> They wouldn't let me have any beer<br> for a whole month.<br> Paddy.<br> Paddy!<br> When are we supposed to<br> pick up the sheep?<br> What's the flaming rush, Ide?<br> Since when do we-?<br> Conscientious bloke,<br> that drover you hired last night.<br> Got here before sunup.<br> So there you are, Carmody.<br> Hale and chipper for the job ahead?<br> Ain't it cracker,<br> Mr. Venneker coming with us, Dad?<br> Sean, you got the wagon packed?<br> - I'm gonna put Mr. Venneker's stuff in.<br> - Hang on.<br> Look, mate...<br> ...I was a bit shickered last night.<br> You looked like something sculptured<br> from the sediment of a beer vat.<br> Never mind about that.<br> The point is, I don't need a drover.<br> Well, where'd you get that idea?<br> You make less sense sober<br> than drunk, Carmody.<br> - You got 1200 head of sheep to move.<br> - I've moved bigger mobs on my own.<br> You're not on your own.<br> If you insist on riding that dejected beast<br> of yours, who's gonna pull the wagon?<br> - The good woman there?<br> - I shouldn't be surprised.<br> Right-o.<br> Look, what's the sense talking?<br> I couldn't pay you anyway.<br> Oh, well, money is not my problem.<br> You can pay me<br> when we get to Cawndilla.<br> Ide, what the devil's<br> he gotta come with us for?<br> You hired me.<br> In any case,<br> I've been here long enough.<br> Most places are fit only<br> for arrivals and departures.<br> I like to do them both<br> as often as possible.<br> - Could be you talking.<br> - I knew we'd end up soul mates.<br> - I'm thinking of chucking up the job.<br> - No, you're not.<br> - Ide, you stay out of this.<br> - Speak for yourself.<br> Do you mind if I handle it?<br> If we have to live in a tent,<br> I say we keep moving.<br> That way, we've got an excuse<br> for not having a home.<br> I'm sick of other people's sympathy.<br> And that's what we always get<br> if we stay too long near any one town.<br> We're taking those sheep to Cawndilla,<br> no matter what.<br> And Mr. Venneker and his horses<br> are going with us.<br> I'm sorry, Carmody.<br> I didn't mean to precipitate that.<br> - Right-o, we'll take you.<br> - Yes.<br> And your horses.<br> That's 1200 sheep. Deliver them<br> to Cawndilla in six weeks...<br> ...the bloke at the other end<br> will pay you a shilling a head.<br> - Goodbye. Good luck.<br> - Thank you.<br> Do me a favor, will you?<br> If you're gonna be a drover,<br> look like a drover.<br> Get rid of that silly, flaming hat.<br> Let me tell you about this silly,<br> flaming hat, my good man.<br> And don't call me that.<br> I'm not your good man.<br> - What do you prefer? Boss?<br> - Wouldn't be a bad idea.<br> This cap belonged to a ship's master<br> in the China trade.<br> Oh, what happened to him?<br> Nothing happened to him. He's just<br> not gonna call you boss, that's all.<br> Got a passenger for you. Here.<br> Good. Thanks, Dad.<br> Rupe, why do you talk to your horses?<br> Don't you know it's very rude<br> to listen to other people's conversations?<br> Sorry.<br> I never thought of horses as people.<br> Let's hope you never have to.<br> Are you a real duke?<br> Shut up, boy.<br> Dad told me you'd been<br> a ship's captain in China.<br> Oh, yes. I had occasion to tell him that.<br> What's China like?<br> Very full.<br> Just as Australia's very empty.<br> Why did you leave?<br> My stomach.<br> I was a notoriously bad sailor.<br> Dad said you must've been a better<br> sailor than you are a horseman.<br> What the devil's he talking about?<br> I was cashiered from the 17th Lancers...<br> ...before he knew one end of a horse<br> from the other.<br> Not that he does now.<br> What does "cashiered" mean?<br> A kind of promotion,<br> from the army into civilian life.<br> - Oh, congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> Go to sleep now.<br> - I'd love to go to China.<br> - What about the farm?<br> I want that more than anything.<br> Want a bit of everything, like me.<br> - Because you're young.<br> - But you're not, though.<br> I'm younger than I seem to you.<br> I've never really grown up, you see.<br> And you've never had time.<br> That's why we're out here instead of<br> in a comfortable tent, like your parents.<br> - Rupe...<br> - No more questions.<br> You're still growing upwards.<br> I'm only growing sideways now.<br> Apart from that,<br> we have a great deal in common.<br> Come on, Sam. Giddap, there.<br> Come on, giddap.<br> Hey, Dad, look, a dingo.<br> - Where?<br> - Over there, Mum.<br> Just like a dingo.<br> Too big a coward to come out<br> in the open and have a go.<br> He'll catch a couple of sheep tonight<br> and kill them just for the fun of it.<br> Not if I get him first, he won't.<br> Get him, Dad!<br> Missed him.<br> Nice bit of riding, all the same.<br> Come on, giddap, Sam.<br> - Good day.<br> - Good day.<br> - Be all right to spill the mob here?<br> - You can use that paddock there.<br> But don't let them stray into the<br> other one. Me grass is thin enough now.<br> Yeah, looks a bit dry.<br> You been having a rough trot?<br> Terrible. No rain now for 10 months.<br> - Good day.<br> - Good day.<br> - We're the Batemans.<br> - Hello.<br> - We're the Carmodys.<br> - How you doing?<br> - This here's-<br> - Rupert Venneker. Afternoon, ladies.<br> English.<br> I ain't had a man<br> take off his hat off to me...<br> ...since the day Ern first met me.<br> Oh, thank you very much.<br> If you'll excuse me... Sheep.<br> Why don't you came in for a cuppa?<br> It'd be welcomed,<br> but I ought to start dinner.<br> How'd you like to cook it<br> on a regular stove?<br> - How did you know?<br> - Ern used to be a drover.<br> I broke my back<br> bending over too many campfires.<br> My name's Kylie.<br> Come on.<br> Here we are.<br> Ida, the way you cook,<br> I'll never hear the last of this.<br> Yeah, she'll do me, Paddy.<br> I'm thinking about keeping her.<br> Oh, I'm a champion woodchopper too.<br> I get plenty of practice.<br> Ern, how long you been here?<br> Started eight years ago<br> with only the land.<br> - Things was pretty crook for a while.<br> - You should've stuck with droving.<br> No worries<br> a horse can't take you away from.<br> - Stay put, that's my motto.<br> - Well, it's different with us.<br> - Ida likes to move about, don't you?<br> - Oh, you'll hear if I don't.<br> Of course, it might be different<br> when the girls marry.<br> Mum, can I take my scraps down<br> to Ollie?<br> - Oh, yes, dear.<br> - Excuse me, missus.<br> I've got plenty of scraps for Ollie too.<br> Well, all right.<br> His mother got me the same way.<br> Darl.<br> After Cawndilla, where are we going?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> What difference does it make?<br> What's the matter, darl?<br> Can't you sleep?<br> I was thinking about Sean.<br> He really wants us to settle down,<br> get a place of our own.<br> You saw the way<br> he looked around here today.<br> It's like that with every farm we pass.<br> He's never stopped talking<br> about the one in Bulinga.<br> Ide, he wouldn't wanna be<br> a blooming farmer, would he?<br> Oh, he might.<br> It's natural for him to want a home.<br> He's not all you, remember?<br> No, but he thinks like me. Anyway,<br> he's not old enough to leave school yet.<br> What school?<br> He's been going to school<br> and I didn't know it?<br> He went to school in Jindabyne.<br> And that six weeks at Broken Hill.<br> What about the time-?<br> Oh, imagine all that schooling.<br> - He must be ready for the university.<br> - He can read and write, can't he?<br> He wouldn't be able to do that<br> if I hadn't taught him.<br> Ide, you're getting me all mixed up.<br> Now, where was I?<br> Sean was getting ready to leave school.<br> We'll have to get him<br> a new suit for that occasion.<br> Well, if you're just<br> gonna be funny about it...<br> Oh, no, no, no. Go on. You're the boss.<br> Right.<br> Well, I was gonna say,<br> all this talk about settling down...<br> ...he could forget about that tomorrow.<br> You know how kids are.<br> You mean, because he feels<br> so comfortable...<br> ...bouncing his guts out in the wagon,<br> sleeping on the ground...<br> ...and eating dust with his food and<br> never getting to know anyone but us?<br> No, I mean because he's a kid, and kids<br> change their mind every 10 minutes.<br> Six months from now, he might<br> even wanna be a tram conductor.<br> And what if six months from now,<br> he still wants a place?<br> Well, that's when<br> we'll talk about it, then.<br> Right now, we better try<br> and get some sleep.<br> Anyway, we ain't got enough money<br> for a fence post, let alone a farm.<br> How much will we have in six months?<br> I thought I smelled smoke.<br> Well, my nose is too full of dust<br> to smell anything.<br> There's a fire on that ridge over there.<br> Well, that ridge is over two miles away.<br> Two miles ain't anything<br> if it's a crown fire.<br> It can go through the treetops<br> faster than a horse can run.<br> Everything underneath it, trees, scrub,<br> air, the lot, just goes up in flames.<br> - I see.<br> - Better get the mob on the run.<br> Fire. You better get a move on, quick.<br> Oh, it's coming this way.<br> There's a river two miles on.<br> Get to the other side, you'll be all right.<br> You hop down, Sean. We'll need you.<br> Don't go risking your life<br> for the sheep, now.<br> - See you the other side of the river.<br> - Come on.<br> It's a crown fire.<br> Get up to the head of the mob.<br> You can make a break for it<br> if you have to.<br> Tell Sean to get after Ida.<br> Get back to your mother, Sean.<br> Your dad says so.<br> - But what about-?<br> - Go on. Cut through there.<br> Move, boy, move. Go on.<br> Mum.<br> Mum! Mum!<br> - Dad told me to come ahead.<br> - But what about him and Mr. Venneker?<br> They'll be all right.<br> He knows what he's doing.<br> I hope so.<br> Come on, Sam, giddap!<br> Giddap!<br> Hey, the mob's breaking up.<br> I've got to turn them back.<br> Paddy, come back!<br> Paddy!<br> Paddy!<br> Paddy!<br> Paddy!<br> Paddy!<br> Whoa, back, Sam! Whoa, back!<br> Whoa, back. Whoa, back!<br> It's swinging away from us.<br> We're all right.<br> We're not all right.<br> Your dad's still in there.<br> Where's Paddy? Where's Paddy?<br> Mum! Mum!<br> Paddy.<br> Oh, Paddy.<br> Well, here it is, Ide.<br> What is it, darl?<br> Nothing, really.<br> Giddap, Sam.<br> Lord love a duck, a woman.<br> Been waiting long?<br> I've been having a bash at the piano.<br> You should've come sooner,<br> you would've heard me singing.<br> I've got a voice like a foghorn,<br> but I enjoy myself.<br> I don't think life's worth living<br> unless you enjoy yourself, eh?<br> Now, where are you from? You look<br> as though you've come a long way.<br> What are your names?<br> Oh, never mind, we can sign that later.<br> - How long you gonna be here?<br> - Just the night.<br> We're off to Queensland in the morning.<br> We come over from Bulinga.<br> Our name's Carmody.<br> Oh, Bulinga? I don't know where that is.<br> My word, you are lucky,<br> all this traveling.<br> I've always wanted to travel.<br> I came from Port Augusta for a week...<br> ...about 15 years ago,<br> and I've never been back since.<br> Have they missed you?<br> Ain't he a joker? With a beard too.<br> I bet that scratches the girls, eh, love?<br> - Now then, what can I do to help?<br> - Well, we'd like a bath.<br> T oo right, too right. Plenty of hot water.<br> Now, who's going first?<br> Or is it all in together, this cold weather?<br> Now, follow me.<br> Nothing like a good hot bath.<br> Weakens the men<br> and strengthens the women.<br> Ought to be the other way around.<br> Now, come on, Mrs. Carmody.<br> I'll take you and sonny first.<br> I'll get the baggage, all right, Mum?<br> Carmody, do you think that creature<br> is planning to give us our baths?<br> I've got Ida to protect me.<br> But I'd watch my step if I was you.<br> Especially if you're gonna stick around<br> for a while.<br> Oh, yes. This is the end of the line,<br> isn't it?<br> Hey, that's right.<br> This is where we split up.<br> Rupe, aren't you moving with us?<br> No. I only signed on to come this far,<br> Sean. Job's finished.<br> Yeah, I suppose you're right.<br> - Come on, Carmody. I'll buy you a drink.<br> - No, let me buy you a drink.<br> You know, Rupe, sometimes<br> you make my teeth ache...<br> ...but there's worse than you.<br> Now that we're parting, Carmody,<br> the drinks are on me.<br> Look, don't start another<br> flaming argument on me.<br> It's my show!<br> Look, Mum.<br> Shearers coming from all over Australia<br> to make money...<br> ...and here we are,<br> turning our backs on it.<br> If we stay here, maybe I could get a job.<br> You're old enough to be a tar-boy.<br> If you and your dad<br> both work as a team...<br> ...we could make quite a little<br> nest egg to put in the jam jar.<br> Just in case we ever decided to settle.<br> Settle? You mean, get a place?<br> Our own place?<br> But what about Dad?<br> He said that if in six months,<br> you still wanted it, we'd talk about it...<br> - ... and that was quite a while back.<br> - Did he mean it?<br> No. But he'll have to talk about it<br> if we've got the money and still want it.<br> - I do want it.<br> - Then that just leaves getting the money.<br> Well done, if I say so,<br> who sings it better alone.<br> There's nothing like a sing-song<br> to get the dust out of your lungs.<br> - How you going? All right?<br> - Very well.<br> How about a dance? Ida, can you play?<br> Oh, I haven't played for years.<br> I suppose I can try.<br> Good-o.<br> No, no, no.<br> No prancing. No, no.<br> Oh, that's more exhausting than track.<br> Rupe, we'd like you to come<br> to Queensland with us.<br> Now, what do you say?<br> I say, you'll hate yourself in the morning.<br> But I think I'll linger a while...<br> ...and investigate the possibilities<br> of Cawndilla.<br> Paddy, do you think he means me?<br> I've never had such a good time.<br> I say, Ida,<br> why don't you stay here a while?<br> No, no, no. One night will do us.<br> We're the restless type, ain't we, Ide?<br> Looks that way, doesn't it?<br> Where are you going, Sean?<br> - I don't know. To bed, I suppose.<br> - No one can blame you.<br> Nothing's so revolting to the young<br> as the sight of their elders at play.<br> You get a good night's rest, Sean.<br> Gotta get an early start in the morning.<br> - Good night, son.<br> - Good night, Mum.<br> But think what we could do<br> with the money.<br> We could fix up the wagon,<br> get new gear, buy an extra horse.<br> You think Sam isn't tired?<br> You think poor old Sam<br> doesn't need a bit of a rest?<br> First it's Sean, then it's you,<br> and now it's Sam I gotta do all this for.<br> What about Ollie? Is he mad for me<br> to be shearing sheep too?<br> Mr. Venneker's coming with us after all.<br> That's nice. What are you doing here?<br> I didn't investigate the possibilities<br> of Cawndilla, after all.<br> Things got very serious<br> after you left the party and...<br> I'm an old fish, Carmody.<br> - I know the hook when I see it.<br> - You ain't going back to her?<br> I probably will, eventually.<br> She's an awfully pleasant person.<br> I flatter myself I created<br> a rather good impression on her.<br> Pity to waste it.<br> Shall we join the shearers?<br> Good day. You the shearing boss?<br> Yeah. Quinlan's the name.<br> Looks like you got your team<br> all filled up already, eh?<br> Pretty near.<br> - How good are you?<br> - Just fair. I ain't done it a while.<br> He doesn't like to boast, but he can<br> do better than 200 sheep a day.<br> - His best is 248.<br> - Yeah.<br> Mister, you got yourself a job.<br> Hold on there. Not so fast.<br> We're sticking together. It's all or none.<br> My kid wants to be a tar-boy.<br> Well, that's easy enough.<br> What about him? He don't look like<br> shearing no sheep, does he?<br> He's quite right, actually.<br> If I have to break my back, I'd rather<br> do it by some more merciful method.<br> I reckon that puts the kibosh on it.<br> No point in wasting Mr. Quinlan's time.<br> Now, look, just a minute.<br> We've still got an opening<br> for a cook and a wool roller.<br> How do either of them strike you?<br> The roller's job is gone<br> to Mr. Venneker.<br> That leaves me.<br> How about me for the cook?<br> Just a minute, darl.<br> You never cooked for a-<br> That queers it.<br> I never use a woman cook.<br> Right-o, if the missus ain't<br> good enough for you, neither am I.<br> Come on, love.<br> Hold your horses.<br> As union representative of this team,<br> I gotta remind you of the rules.<br> It's the men who choose the cook,<br> not the boss.<br> Bluey, use your head, man.<br> They've gotta have a cook they can<br> abuse if the tucker's not up to scratch.<br> That tucker will be up to scratch,<br> all right.<br> If that's them, why don't you ask them?<br> All right. Hey, you blokes,<br> come on over here, will you?<br> Come on, move it.<br> There's a lady here<br> looking for a job as cook.<br> Now, it's up to you blokes,<br> like the union rep says.<br> As far as I'm concerned, the vote's no.<br> A wool shed's no place for a woman.<br> I won't be in the wool shed,<br> I'll be in the kitchen.<br> Been a long time since I had a meal<br> cooked by a woman.<br> - Be a nice change.<br> - I'm not worried about the food, missus.<br> But there's rough language<br> that goes on in the shed.<br> Some might shock you,<br> you know what I mean?<br> - You wouldn't be able to stand it, love.<br> - I've stood your language for 16 years.<br> If she can cook as good as my missus,<br> I'm for her.<br> I'm for giving the lady a chance.<br> Well, yeah. Let's try her out.<br> All we can get is indigestion.<br> Sean!<br> That boy of mine<br> is real keen to get started.<br> He'll do.<br> It's that husband of yours<br> who don't seem too keen.<br> You haven't got a worry.<br> He's as happy as a lark.<br> What the-?<br> All New South bloody Wales to drive in,<br> and you gotta aim at us!<br> Didn't you hear me blow me horn?<br> What's blowing your horn<br> got to do with it?<br> - We had the right of way!<br> - Right of way? Go-<br> Right-o. You're in the wrong,<br> and that's all there is to it.<br> - Come on. Shake a leg.<br> - You wanna pull your head in.<br> - Herbie was in the right.<br> - Who asked you to put your oar in-?<br> Like to make a small wager<br> on who's gonna get-?<br> Hey! Get back!<br> Right-o, everybody. All aboard.<br> The war's over.<br> - Get up.<br> - All aboard!<br> Well, I must've drew Jack Dempsey.<br> I was going up and down<br> like a lavatory seat.<br> Ocker, it was you<br> what got us into that donnybrook.<br> - Good on him. Had the time of me life.<br> - Looked like you done some pro fighting.<br> I was up for the middleweight title<br> back in '01.<br> Got put in me back in the ninth.<br> Too much unwatered beer.<br> - I remember you. You're Turk Tuthill.<br> - I was all right.<br> Just wasn't good enough to be champ.<br> I'd say Paddy's missus<br> was champ today.<br> I never seen anyone<br> break up a fight so quick.<br> You got a real good sort there, Paddy.<br> Yeah.<br> Anyone know how to spell<br> "obstetrician"?<br> I'll tell you how if you tell us why.<br> Because I'm gonna have a baby.<br> - Did you hear that?<br> - Good on you, boy.<br> - Why, you little beauty.<br> - You'll do me for a dadda.<br> What do you want, Bluey,<br> a boy or a girl?<br> Make it a girl. They never have to work<br> as hard as us poor mugs.<br> Why don't you stop laughing?<br> If it is a boy, you gonna bring him up<br> to be a shearer?<br> Oh, no, no.<br> No, he's gonna be a cricketer.<br> The best bat since Victor Trumper.<br> He's gonna play for Australia<br> like I wanted to but never did.<br> Neither will he, because he's gonna<br> be a she. I'm never wrong.<br> Ocker, why don't you shut<br> your big, sour trap?<br> I hope he's good enough, Bluey.<br> Oh, he'll be good enough,<br> I'll see to that.<br> All he's gotta do is be born a boy.<br> - What's amusing you?<br> - Gee, it's gonna be fun.<br> This is the first time<br> I was ever away from home.<br> With your mom and dad<br> not 50 yards outside that window.<br> You call that being away from home?<br> Being out in the world's<br> a state of mind, not of geography.<br> Distance between that tent<br> and this bunkhouse...<br> ...is the longest journey<br> you'll ever make in your life.<br> Anybody hollers for a bucket of dip,<br> you bring it, see?<br> You can't go wrong,<br> short of getting counted for a sheep.<br> Here comes the brains.<br> All right, men!<br> Hold on. Want him to think<br> you hear him?<br> You gotta keep the bosses<br> in their places.<br> This is the boss, Mr. Halstead.<br> Good day, men.<br> I want you to work fast,<br> but careful, right?<br> All right.<br> Get ready, now.<br> Who is it?<br> Good morning. I'm Jean Halstead.<br> Oh, the boss's wife. Come in.<br> I'm Ida Carmody.<br> I thought I'd drop in<br> and see if there's anything you need.<br> As a matter of fact, there is.<br> Would the boss go for me<br> getting a little oilcloth...<br> ...to edge the shelves and windows?<br> I don't see why not.<br> Sorry it's such a dreary place<br> for you to work in.<br> It's the first kitchen I've been able<br> to call my own since I left home...<br> ...and that's a long time ago.<br> To me, it's heaven.<br> Well, come on, sit down,<br> have a cuppa with me.<br> I just made a fresh pot.<br> I'll bet you didn't get that dress<br> in Cawndilla.<br> You remind me of a society girl who<br> gets their picture in the Sydney papers.<br> I used to be one before I got married.<br> Thought I'd changed by now.<br> Oh, aged? Not so as it shows.<br> You don't even look married.<br> I don't feel it most of the time.<br> Oh, living way out here<br> must be a big change...<br> ...from what you're used to.<br> How do you like it?<br> I'm trying to.<br> Bob loves the place so...<br> ...and he worries about<br> my not belonging.<br> The real trouble is, I've nothing to do.<br> Sorry.<br> I don't usually spill over like that.<br> Don't be silly.<br> You get starved for another woman<br> to talk to sometimes. I know.<br> This is a good country for sheep,<br> and it's not bad for men...<br> ...but it's hard on us women.<br> The men come here for the sheep.<br> We come here for the men...<br> ...and most of us finish up<br> looking like the sheep.<br> Wrinkled faces, knotty hair,<br> not even much of a mind of our own.<br> I think you'd always have a mind<br> of your own, Mrs. Carmody.<br> You sure you have time for a chat<br> with all those men to cook for?<br> It's their aching backs they'll be worrying<br> about tonight, not their stomachs.<br> First day's hard on them,<br> but it's a blessing for the cook.<br> Well, I hope you're satisfied,<br> you and Sean.<br> And Sam. Mustn't forget about Sam.<br> Shut up. You're worse than Ocker.<br> Why don't you give yourself<br> a chance to like it?<br> I don't see how you can like it,<br> cooking for a mob of no-hopers.<br> Working your fingers to the bone.<br> I'm having a real good time.<br> I got room to put things<br> and a chair to sit on...<br> ...and another woman around<br> if I want a bit of a gossip.<br> She's a nice little piece,<br> not too happy either.<br> That Halstead probably gives her<br> a rough time of it.<br> No, just the opposite.<br> Keeps her wrapped in cotton wool.<br> Women don't like that, you know.<br> Educate me, darl.<br> Tell me what women do like.<br> All right.<br> No, no, no. Around here,<br> we do everything by the bell.<br> Get up by the bell, go to sleep<br> by the bell, eat by the bell...<br> ...wash by the bell.<br> We ain't got a bell for that, Ide.<br> Oh, what's the use?<br> Welcome back, Rupe.<br> What would you like?<br> I'd like a schooner of beer,<br> among other things.<br> Ida, we have a visitor.<br> Oh, just a wild guess...<br> ...but would you be Liz Brown,<br> Bluey's wife?<br> She's been traveling<br> three days and nights.<br> You took an awful risk.<br> - Might've had the baby on the train.<br> - I don't care. I want to be with Bluey.<br> And I don't care how angry he is either.<br> Oh, come on in and sit down.<br> You're all tired out.<br> - Sean, hurry up and get Liz a cuppa.<br> - All right.<br> There. Give me these, that's it.<br> I know the men<br> aren't supposed to bring their wives.<br> - Do you think they'll let me stay?<br> - Well, I don't know.<br> It's up to the boss, really.<br> What do you think, Jean?<br> Well, I don't see why she shouldn't.<br> There's lots of room up at the house.<br> And after all, it's my house too.<br> You wait here, Liz, and don't worry.<br> You powder your nose<br> after you've had your cuppa.<br> I'm gonna go and get your old man.<br> Sean here will keep you company.<br> He's a special friend of Bluey's.<br> Thank you.<br> I must look awful.<br> No, no, honest. You look good.<br> I mean, no worse<br> than a sheep does before-<br> You're not gonna have the baby now,<br> are you?<br> No.<br> I wouldn't dream of doing such a thing<br> to a special friend of Bluey's.<br> Liz! Liz! Liz!<br> Liz.<br> There's one doctor in Cawndilla.<br> He covers 500 miles,<br> so he's never there.<br> I just hope you women<br> know what you're doing.<br> We ought to,<br> we've been having babies long enough.<br> Tar-boy missing. Shearer missing.<br> All the men carrying on<br> like a bunch of school kids.<br> What sort of way is this to run a shed?<br> - Oh, shut up!<br> - Oh, shut up!<br> - Morning, Mum.<br> - Morning, dear.<br> There's a letter for you<br> from the Batemans.<br> - Bluey.<br> - Thanks.<br> Hey, listen to this, fellas.<br> It's from a mate of mine in Melbourne.<br> He puts five quid on a horse<br> and wins 200.<br> And here I am playing barber<br> to a mob of greasy sheep.<br> You're doing all right<br> out of greasy sheep. We all are.<br> I'm halfway to paying off<br> me radio shop.<br> I hate to say it, but Bluey's right.<br> One more season, and I'll own<br> the neatest pub you've ever seen.<br> A cheerful place that will be.<br> Come on, you blokes. Let's go!<br> - Oh, come on. What's the matter with-?<br> - Back to the torture chamber.<br> Come on.<br> Gotta get this thing going.<br> - Made it again.<br> - Good on you, missus.<br> Hey, wasn't that the starting bell?<br> They can start without me.<br> I'm gonna have a cuppa tea<br> with my missus.<br> Well, good on you.<br> You know, we haven't said 10 words<br> to each other all week?<br> I know.<br> What about going to town<br> on Saturday night?<br> You know, have a few drinks, talk.<br> What do you say?<br> Oh, I'd love it, Paddy.<br> Tell you what.<br> You let me have half a quid<br> out of the jam jar...<br> ...I'll treat you like a bloke<br> with his first girl.<br> Ten shillings? Oh, I don't know.<br> Oh, come on, Ide.<br> I break me back for you.<br> Let me have a bit of fun.<br> Right-o. Saturday night it is, eh?<br> Spending the night in Cawndilla?<br> Would a cup of hot, strong tea<br> be possible?<br> A few more visits to Mrs. Firth<br> and you're gonna end up married.<br> I've paid many visits<br> to many Mrs. Firths all my life...<br> ...and I'm still free.<br> - It's all a question of technique.<br> - Yeah.<br> But let's leave my problems<br> and consider yours.<br> Your good man seemed almost cheerful.<br> No, not really.<br> This job's got him down<br> worse than I expected.<br> Well, he's a man who hates routine.<br> What he need is a little excitement.<br> But where's he gonna get it?<br> Barring some sheep turning round<br> and shearing him.<br> Tea's up.<br> Time for a smoko, mate.<br> Right-o, let's stretch the spine for a bit.<br> Gentlemen, I have a sudden yen<br> for some nice, clean, easy money.<br> - Do you wanna start a two-up game?<br> - We'd only take money from each other.<br> What we want<br> is to take it from someone else.<br> What are you talking about?<br> In this shed, we have a gun shearer<br> who's among the fastest I've ever seen.<br> - Paddy.<br> - Exactly.<br> A shearing contest.<br> Well, I ain't no flaming<br> world's champion, you know.<br> Didn't say you were,<br> but let's have none of this hanging back.<br> Can't stand false modesty.<br> Well, if you blokes wanna risk<br> your money on me, I'll give it a burl.<br> Hey, Paddy!<br> Saturday night,<br> and you're just standing around?<br> Shearers ain't what they used to be.<br> Quinlan's taking us all in to Cawndilla.<br> We're going to fix up a shearing contest<br> with the Mulgrue mob.<br> - They're bound to be in town.<br> - Come on in with us.<br> I promised the missus I'd take her out.<br> She'd kill me if I welshed.<br> That's how it is when a bloke's married.<br> Can't call his soul his own.<br> - I tell you.<br> - You tell him, Ocker.<br> What about you, Sean?<br> You off to the pictures?<br> Rupe's taking me to a play,<br> with live actors.<br> Not very live probably,<br> it's just a small touring company.<br> - Don't start tearing it down in advance.<br> - No, it's a fine night, stars are shining.<br> My missus is all dolled up for me.<br> Let's not anybody<br> start tearing anything down.<br> Should have a tie, really.<br> What's the matter, darl?<br> You ain't dressed.<br> Paddy. Paddy, I can't go.<br> Liz is pretty close.<br> I just can't take a chance and leave her.<br> Why can't Bluey sit with her?<br> - What about the Halsteads?<br> - None of them know what to do.<br> Besides, she wants Bluey to go out<br> and have a good time.<br> I've been looking forward<br> to this all week long.<br> You think I haven't?<br> But you can understand, can't you?<br> Well, I suppose so.<br> Look, why don't we just forget<br> about going to town?<br> We go down by the tent<br> and build a fire, sit around and talk.<br> Pretend we're back on the track again.<br> We'll save ourselves 10 bob.<br> Well, you see, Liz asked<br> if she could bring her knitting over...<br> ...and sit with me, company-like.<br> I thought you were going out<br> with the men-<br> What'd you have to do that for, Ide?<br> You didn't ask me about it.<br> - Hey, Bluey! What are you doing?<br> - Blue! Hey!<br> Come on, Bluey!<br> Thanks, Ide.<br> Hey, come on, Paddy.<br> Paddy, I wish you'd go along<br> and have a few beers. I'd feel better.<br> Besides, I need you to go<br> to see that Bluey gets back early...<br> ...and not too drunk. Will you?<br> Right. Hey, Quinlan, wait for me!<br> Hey, Bluey, what are you gonna call<br> this girl of yours when she's born?<br> Ocker, I told you a dozen times,<br> it's gonna be a boy.<br> - That's right, ain't it, Paddy?<br> - Anything you say, Bluey.<br> Hey, Bluey. You ain't drinking<br> too much, are you?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Right-o.<br> Why do you say this man of yours<br> can beat any shearer we got?<br> Is that just a figure of speech, or do you<br> have in mind, for example, money?<br> I got in mind, for example, 20 quid.<br> Beside what the rest of the blokes in my<br> team have in their minds, you follow?<br> When we was mixing it<br> by the trucks that day...<br> ...I couldn't help but notice you kept<br> leading with your right, like this:<br> No offense,<br> but that's why I smeared you.<br> - My right's where I pack my punch.<br> - And where you leave yourself open.<br> Now, why don't you try<br> something like this:<br> - See?<br> - Like this, you mean?<br> - Watch it, Turk!<br> - Careful, mate!<br> See what I mean?<br> Friends, Romans, shearers.<br> Hello, Sean. How did you like the play?<br> Oh, don't question him, madame.<br> Don't waken him from his dream.<br> He fell in love with the leading lady.<br> - Honest truth, give a bloke a go.<br> - Oh, no shame in that.<br> When I was your age, I was<br> head over heels in love with Lily Langtry.<br> And now, my mulga-scrub lily,<br> I'm head over heels in love with you.<br> Oh, no.<br> Hey, Sean.<br> Oh, hello, Dad. Didn't see you.<br> What are you doing all by yourself?<br> I like being by myself,<br> except for you, of course.<br> My own family.<br> Your mother wouldn't come with me.<br> Should've taken you.<br> But I was going to the play with Rupe.<br> That's what I mean.<br> All my family seems to be<br> spending their time with somebody else.<br> Madame, the memory of-<br> The memory of your bell-like laughter<br> keeps calling me back.<br> Oh, Rupe. Those duke's daughters<br> must miss you.<br> The duke's daughters. They haven't<br> heard half the things I want to say.<br> - Can't we go?<br> - Oh, I can't leave the till, Rupe. Not yet.<br> Well, have I come to this?<br> A cash register as a rival?<br> Gert. I'm back, Gert.<br> How's the cold you had in your chest?<br> Matter of fact, how's your chest?<br> - You miss me while I was gone?<br> - Certainly not.<br> - Who the devil's this, Gert?<br> - Hello, Jack. This here's Rupe Venneker.<br> Rupe, this is Jack Patchogue,<br> mayor of Cawndilla.<br> He's a sort of friend.<br> - Pleased to meet you, Venneker.<br> - Patchogue.<br> "Sort of friend"?<br> Gert, what's been going on here?<br> Now, you pull your head in, Jack.<br> What I do with my spare time<br> is my own affair.<br> - Now, listen to me.<br> - Yes, you do that, Your Worship.<br> And I'll be next door<br> warming the cockles of my heart...<br> ...for you-know-who.<br> You're gonna die laughing at him, Jack.<br> And you should've heard the words.<br> When you think it's the same language,<br> you say, "Pass the salt in"-<br> - You just can't understand how they-<br> - Sean.<br> Sean, have a beer.<br> - What?<br> - Have a beer.<br> You went to the play with Rupe<br> because that's what he likes.<br> Now have a beer with me<br> because that's what I like.<br> All right.<br> Here, love, small beer.<br> Just wish Mum could see me now.<br> Now, where is the doctor?<br> But he must have said<br> when he'd be back, I-<br> I'm sorry I yelled, but please,<br> send him over the minute he gets in.<br> The doctor's at the Jameson place,<br> You think you might catch him<br> before he leaves?<br> I can have a go.<br> - What will we do?<br> - Be a welcoming committee.<br> That baby's on its way,<br> doctor or no doctor.<br> Well, I better help Liz get into bed.<br> Mrs. Carmody, I don't want Jean<br> to be frightened.<br> Well, you think we should let Liz<br> have that baby alone?<br> Give Jean credit, Mr. Halstead.<br> She's a strong girl.<br> She'll do what she has to do.<br> Right. Try Mrs. Firth's pub,<br> see if our mob's there.<br> If not, try every pub in town.<br> They're bound to be in one of them.<br> Nobody home.<br> There's nobody home but me.<br> And I'm in terrible hurry.<br> We played lots of tennis at school<br> and did a lot of surfing.<br> Sydney's lovely in the summer.<br> Couldn't find him.<br> Ida, I feel crook.<br> - Starting to hurt quite a lot.<br> - Not for nothing, Liz.<br> I'll try to be good.<br> Don't. You scream the house down<br> if it helps.<br> If she doesn't, I probably will.<br> - Ida, how long were you with Sean?<br> - It's different every time, you know.<br> Bluey. I want Bluey.<br> - Hang on, Liz.<br> - I want Bluey with me.<br> - You'll be all right, Liz.<br> - Bluey.<br> - I'll get him.<br> - What?<br> I'll go into town, find him,<br> and bring him back.<br> All right, but don't be long.<br> Hello. What are you doing here,<br> Mrs. Halstead?<br> I'm looking for Bluey.<br> - Hello, love.<br> - Have you seen Bluey Brown?<br> Where is he, I said?<br> Oh, get away from me.<br> Oh, here he- Bluey? Here he is, love.<br> Right over here.<br> Look at him. Full as a goog.<br> It's just that after-hours drinking.<br> Well, sober him up and be quick about it.<br> Liz wants him.<br> Oh, hey. Hey, Bluey! Hey.<br> Hey, Bluey.<br> - You're having a baby.<br> - I know that.<br> It's lambing time at Wattle Run!<br> - I'll lay a quid it's a boy!<br> - Neither one, it's twins!<br> Come on! Come on, you!<br> - I'll lay a quid it's a boy!<br> - Neither one, it's twins!<br> Come on, you blokes! I'm driving!<br> I couldn't get the doc.<br> He's gone out to Big Billabong.<br> Bob, I must go and help Ida.<br> See that the men get Bluey sobered up.<br> Well, here he is, Ide.<br> All in one piece,<br> and almost as good as new.<br> Shut up, all of you!<br> Well, stone the flaming crows,<br> if it ain't old Ide.<br> Good on you, Ide!<br> Well, thanks for all your kind help!<br> Now then, get him sobered up. I don't<br> care how you do it, but do it quick.<br> What am I, his flaming keeper<br> or something?<br> Hello, Mum. I saw my first play<br> and had my first beer tonight.<br> Aren't you his keeper either?<br> Ida, hurry.<br> Come on now, Liz. Push.<br> That's it. Now harder. Come on.<br> There's a girl.<br> Here, Jean. Let her pull on your hands.<br> Well, here he is, what's left of him.<br> The rest is down the hill.<br> Well, he looks shrunk, but human.<br> Ida. Oh, Ida, I feel crook.<br> No, you don't, Bluey.<br> Go on in and say hello to your son.<br> Oh, I gotta tell the fellas.<br> Well, this is the first baby<br> born on Wattle Run that isn't a sheep.<br> Won't be the last, I hope.<br> What are you two talking about?<br> - Morning.<br> - You're up early.<br> Well, I needed something to do.<br> - I told Turk to tell you-<br> - Yes, yes, he told me. Thanks.<br> Didn't want you to worry.<br> - All right, look-<br> - Paddy.<br> Before you say anything, I...<br> - I'm sorry about last night.<br> - It's all right.<br> I'm sorry about Sean, for that matter.<br> I don't know what I was thinking about.<br> - It was just one beer, Ide.<br> - Well, won't kill him, eh?<br> Everything all right, then?<br> Yeah.<br> Only...<br> ...I'm turning in my time tomorrow.<br> We're leaving Saturday night,<br> right after work.<br> We've been here six weeks, Ide.<br> You needed a change, you said.<br> All right.<br> Well, ain't six weeks long enough?<br> Listen, Ide. Everything's going wrong<br> between us since we've been here.<br> We never see Sean anymore.<br> We never see each other.<br> When we do, we're dead tired or there's<br> a hundred strangers hanging around.<br> It isn't staying I care about,<br> it's the money we're making.<br> We don't need the money.<br> We've never needed it.<br> We need it now. I want a home, Paddy,<br> just like Sean does.<br> I don't want to ride that wagon<br> right into my grave.<br> Oh, what good does it do<br> turning away every time I say it?<br> I told you in the beginning,<br> I couldn't get stuck in one place.<br> I had to keep on the move.<br> You kept on saying it was all right.<br> Now, what'd you wanna lie for?<br> I never promised I wouldn't change.<br> I never promised I wouldn't get older<br> and scared.<br> What do you mean? You think I can't<br> take care of you and the kid?<br> We're both getting older. It's time we-<br> - Don't talk for me. I'm not finished yet.<br> - I'm just trying to look ahead, Paddy.<br> Well, I'm not looking past Saturday.<br> That's when I'm gonna go.<br> You and Sean<br> don't wanna come with me?<br> Well, don't.<br> Hey, Paddy.<br> Wait a minute, will you?<br> Everything's right for the contest<br> with the Mulgrue bunch.<br> It's okay with the boss too,<br> so we fixed it for Saturday.<br> - We're depending on you.<br> - I don't want nobody depending on me.<br> - You better get somebody else.<br> - Stone the crows.<br> You heard us make the plans<br> last night. You didn't stop us.<br> I was drunk last night.<br> I ain't gonna split a gut just so I can say<br> I'm faster than some other bloke.<br> That dirty dingo.<br> A man ought to knock his head off.<br> He could have his reasons.<br> Oh, blast his reasons.<br> He's backing out like a yellow dog.<br> How we gonna look, going over<br> to Mulgrue's, telling him it's all off?<br> Oh, maybe we're better off this way.<br> A dingo like that, he'd probably throw<br> his hand in halfway through the contest.<br> Dad just told the men<br> he wouldn't be in the contest...<br> ...after letting them set it up<br> for next Saturday.<br> He wants us to leave next Saturday.<br> Then how will we ever<br> get enough money for a place?<br> He doesn't care about a place.<br> He's going<br> whether we go with him or not...<br> ...and that's how strong<br> he feels about it, Sean.<br> - But we never split up before.<br> - And we're not gonna split up now.<br> I'm gonna stay, Mum.<br> And I think you ought to stay too.<br> Sean, you've got your whole life to live.<br> We're halfway through ours,<br> your dad and me.<br> There are other people waiting for you...<br> ...but there's no one waiting for us<br> except each other.<br> Don't ever ask me to choose<br> between you and your dad...<br> ...because I'll choose him every time.<br> Good day.<br> Mum says you're leaving Saturday.<br> I got me own reasons, Sean.<br> You're too young to understand.<br> I get sick of being told I'm too young,<br> like it's a disease or something.<br> I told Rupe there'd be no sense<br> talking to you.<br> What right have you got<br> going over our business with him?<br> He was sticking up for you. He didn't<br> think you were a dingo, like Clint said.<br> I'll fix that Clint later.<br> The minute you turn your back,<br> people go around talking about you.<br> There's not one of them game enough<br> to say it to me face.<br> I think you're a dingo<br> for running out on Mum and me.<br> Don't hit me, Dad, or you can leave<br> and I'll never come after you.<br> Don't ever talk like that<br> to me again, Sean.<br> I might have killed you.<br> You're not gonna leave, are you, Dad?<br> Please don't.<br> - Hey, Paddy, can we see you?<br> - Just a minute.<br> It's the men. All of them, Dad.<br> I know, Sean. I feel crook about it, but-<br> Well, they just can't back down.<br> If there was only some way...<br> Yeah?<br> We have a new plan, Carmody.<br> - What plan?<br> - A plan for the competition.<br> We want the Mulgrues to see that<br> we have a man in whom we're proud.<br> Cut it out, will you?<br> But the main object is to raise money<br> for a worthy cause.<br> Christening present for Bluey's baby.<br> Well, crikey. Why didn't you say so?<br> I didn't know it was anything like that.<br> Doesn't mean we can't bet on the side.<br> We can still make a pile of money.<br> As long as Bluey's nipper<br> gets a big piece of it...<br> ...I'll be only too happy to give it a go.<br> You beaut, Dad.<br> Hey, let us in on the secret.<br> It's the shearing contest.<br> It's all set up for next Saturday.<br> Well, now.<br> I come over to give you all an invite<br> to a party in honor of Bluey's baby.<br> But it seems to me as though<br> he's gonna have to share it...<br> ...with Paddy, the people's choice.<br> Right-o, boys. Next Sunday at the pub,<br> beer, saveloys and sausage rolls.<br> Come on, Rupe. Walk me to the car.<br> How does that bloke do it?<br> Ide, I was thinking...<br> ...since I have to stay here<br> for the contest anyway...<br> ...might as well stay<br> to the end of the season.<br> Well, how about a cuppa?<br> You haven't had a bite all day, have you?<br> T oo right.<br> - You hungry?<br> - No, I'll have an earbash with the boys.<br> See you later.<br> Carmody, there isn't a living soul<br> in Wattle Run who hasn't bet on you.<br> Even a couple sheep have been trying<br> to get a word with me.<br> I just hope this Mulgrue mob's<br> brought enough money.<br> I'm not guaranteeing anything.<br> None of that. No modesty.<br> It's confidence gonna win the day.<br> It is? Well, that's good.<br> I was afraid it was gonna be me.<br> Hey, here comes the Mulgrue mob.<br> Johnson. Are you the challenger?<br> I don't know why they picked me,<br> I'm the worst man we got.<br> I ain't counting any chickens, Herb.<br> Don't rush it, Carmody.<br> Just keep a nice, steady pace.<br> Two hundred and ninety<br> should be enough to win.<br> I've heard bull in me time,<br> but that takes some beating.<br> Well, if you're gonna do it, let's do it.<br> You're here, stand number four.<br> Here, Wilson.<br> Keep your eye on those, will you?<br> You gonna unscrew your wooden leg?<br> No, we don't want<br> to embarrass the champ.<br> They must be off their rockers,<br> that Mulgrue bunch.<br> - He's 80 if he's a day.<br> - Paddy'll make a monkey out of him.<br> I wouldn't wanna show him up,<br> anything like that. It wouldn't be right.<br> Hey, Clint, lay a fiver for me, will you?<br> - You're on, mate.<br> - Just win, Dad.<br> We got a quid on you,<br> Mum and me. Good luck.<br> The contestants will work<br> in two-hour stretches...<br> ...with five-minute rests<br> and one hour for a meal.<br> The score will be kept jointly<br> by our Mr. Quinlan...<br> ...and Mr. Wilson of Mulgrue's.<br> May the best man win.<br> - Stand by.<br> - Come on. Hey.<br> Go for your quota, Paddy.<br> You won't get any compo<br> if you collapse, Herbie.<br> That little runt couldn't bag a hussy.<br> Work from the hip, Carmody.<br> Now, easy follow-through.<br> Follow through with that instrument,<br> come on.<br> - How does he look?<br> - Fresh as a babe.<br> You've been flat out like a lizard drinking,<br> but he's been with you all the way.<br> It's shocking.<br> That cove ain't human.<br> Try not to show him that you're nervous.<br> In fact, it might be good psychology<br> if you could manage a hearty laugh.<br> You laugh.<br> I can't think of anything funny.<br> - We could tickle you.<br> - Don't worry, Dad. He can't keep it up.<br> - That ain't what I'm worried about.<br> - Paddy, his legs'll give out.<br> - You got a long way to go yet.<br> - That's what I'm worried about.<br> Stand by.<br> Break for lunch.<br> That little old weasel.<br> - What I'd give to have money on him.<br> - Ocker!<br> Do you practice being a louse<br> or does it just come natural?<br> Dad, you've got an hour.<br> - Go and lie down. I'll bring your-<br> - No, he mustn't.<br> It'd give Johnson<br> an immense psychological advantage...<br> ...to know that<br> Paddy's lying flat on his back.<br> He hasn't even come outside.<br> Has it occurred to you that he may be<br> too exhausted even to reach the door?<br> I'm gonna go lie down in the tent.<br> - Paddy-<br> - Rupe.<br> We may be neck and neck<br> in the shearing...<br> ...but psychologically,<br> he's got me licked.<br> - Ten for Johnny Sanford.<br> - Ten for Johnny Sanford.<br> - Two for Willis Jacobs.<br> - Right, two for Jacobs.<br> Ten for Costello. Four for Pierce.<br> All right, four for Pierce.<br> And a tenner for you, Wilson.<br> Do you want that now, Wilson?<br> Bluey.<br> I'm sorry I didn't win<br> for your little nipper, Bluey.<br> Don't worry about it, Paddy.<br> You did your best.<br> And three for Sandy Sanderson,<br> and that's the lot.<br> Well, good day. I've enjoyed meself.<br> Thanks for asking us.<br> Poor Dad.<br> Just when he was feeling cheerful.<br> He'll stay cheerful,<br> once we're on the move again.<br> - Sean, remember that farm in Bulinga?<br> - Remember it?<br> Whenever we talk about a place,<br> that's the one I'm thinking of.<br> It's still for sale.<br> Mrs. Bateman wrote me.<br> I didn't wanna tell you about it before.<br> I suppose those farms<br> don't get sold very quick.<br> - Did she say how much it costs?<br> - Two thousand pounds.<br> At the end of the season,<br> we'll have better than 400.<br> That's enough for a down payment.<br> That's if Dad wanted a place.<br> First we'll get the money,<br> then we'll worry about Dad.<br> Speaking of Dad,<br> this doesn't seem tactful, somehow.<br> Quiet.<br> Quiet!<br> Quiet!<br> Right-o, who's for peeling potatoes?<br> Hey, fellas!<br> Listen, there's a room outside<br> with sawdust on the floor.<br> How is it for a game of two-up?<br> I've got a feeling<br> it's us for peeling potatoes.<br> Woman's instinct, I call that.<br> Well, go on, booby.<br> Come on, girls.<br> Where are all those big betters?<br> Are we all here?<br> I'm for five.<br> - Here's five quid to say I can head them.<br> - I'll set the center.<br> - I'll bet he heads them.<br> - Thirty bob.<br> - A pound he heads them.<br> - A pound he tails them.<br> Two bob he tails them!<br> - Yes, I'll set you.<br> - Right.<br> - You all set on the side?<br> - Yeah.<br> Right-o, come in, spinner.<br> Now, fair go.<br> Up they go, and it's a head up.<br> And it's... tails!<br> I won. You should've bet<br> the same as me, Dad.<br> - Son, you see, I only had a quid left-<br> - I'll bet the ten.<br> Excuse me, Dad.<br> Don't wanna miss the next toss.<br> Four bob, he tails them.<br> Four pounds, head.<br> Serving beer on Sundays<br> and running a gambling joint?<br> I could get 12 months in jail<br> and lose me license.<br> Why don't you make them<br> stop the game then?<br> Oh, let them have their fun.<br> They don't get much, the men out here.<br> They battle all their lives<br> just to try and stay ahead of nature...<br> ...keeping this part of the country alive.<br> And when they're dead,<br> they're forgotten.<br> Nobody thanks them.<br> All they get is abuse.<br> Getting drunk on Sunday and gambling<br> may be against the law...<br> ...but the law was made<br> by city wowsers.<br> They don't know nothing of what it<br> takes to keep a man alive out here.<br> Beer, that's what it takes, Gert. Beer.<br> Well, it's not like you<br> to leave a two-up game.<br> What happened, your luck run out?<br> Anybody home?<br> I'm the owner. What'll it be, a room?<br> Yes, missus, and tucker,<br> if you can manage.<br> Evan Evans, the name is.<br> Just delivered a mob of sheep.<br> I'm a drover myself.<br> Paddy Carmody's my name.<br> - You're late in the season.<br> - Ran into a card game on the way.<br> Lasted a month.<br> Any place my sulky and horses<br> can get shelter?<br> Here, I'll put them up for you.<br> Oh, in case you're interested,<br> there's a two-up game going on in there.<br> - Where?<br> - All right, skinny, after you're fed.<br> "Skinny. "<br> You know how much I won already?<br> Four quid. What's the matter, Dad?<br> You're not playing.<br> I ain't got no money.<br> Which, if you had eyes,<br> you could see for yourself.<br> Well, do you want a loan?<br> Take anything, Dad. Take it all.<br> A quid'll do me. A quid he tails them.<br> Come in, spinner!<br> - Tails, it is.<br> - Beauty.<br> You'll do me for a good luck charm.<br> Two quid he tails them again.<br> Fifteen years in a pub...<br> ...and I still prefer a good cuppa tea<br> to a bottle of beer.<br> Of course, I gotta get drunk<br> now and then...<br> ...to set an example to the customers.<br> More tea, Ide?<br> I'm going to miss the whole lot of you.<br> Just a couple of more weeks, isn't it?<br> Don't give me much time<br> to work on Rupe.<br> Heads!<br> - A fiver on tails.<br> - You're on.<br> He's going again. He's going again.<br> Oh, come on. This is a party,<br> and the food's ready.<br> - Is that all the money you got?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Another fiver he tails them.<br> - You're covered.<br> - Paddy's won 17 straight tosses.<br> - What?<br> - I loaned him money, changed his luck.<br> - All right, come in, spinner.<br> You got it, Paddy!<br> - How much has Paddy won?<br> - About 200 quid.<br> Sean, with what's left in the jar...<br> ...that's almost enough<br> for a down payment on the farm.<br> Well, what do you reckon?<br> You lost a packet already.<br> Don't worry about me, friend.<br> This is the air I breathe.<br> You've cleaned me out.<br> That's the way it goes.<br> I'll tell you what, mate.<br> You put up that horse you got outside...<br> ...I'll bet everything I've won tonight<br> against him.<br> One toss of the pennies,<br> what do you say?<br> What do I say when I won him<br> in a poker game anyway?<br> You're on, friend. And I call tails.<br> Chilla, you ready?<br> Brother Carmody,<br> you've got yourself a racehorse.<br> - Make more of him than I did.<br> - And the money, Mum.<br> And the money too.<br> Oh, you- You won!<br> Gee, Dad, ain't he wonderful to watch?<br> Ever since I was a kid...<br> ...the thing I wanted most in the world<br> was a horse like that.<br> You reckon you could ride him flat out<br> and not fall off him?<br> Could I? You just watch me.<br> Go, Sean!<br> Come on, you little beauty! Let's have it!<br> Look at him go! You beauty!<br> Well, how is he?<br> Oh, darl, he's a beauty.<br> - What you gonna do with him?<br> - When we quit here...<br> ...let's take him round to some of<br> the small bush tracks, picnic races.<br> Everything works out,<br> we'll head for a big race meeting.<br> Could we go back to Bulinga?<br> - They run a cup meeting and we-<br> - We could see Kylie Bateman?<br> No, Mum. That wasn't<br> what I was thinking about.<br> Well, why not?<br> All right, we'll make it Bulinga...<br> ...and we'll stop<br> and talk to the Batemans on the way.<br> Got the makings<br> of a real champion there, haven't we?<br> Yes, if he's looked after properly,<br> and I shall see to it that he is.<br> Why, you know something<br> about training horses?<br> Is there anything he don't know about?<br> I was brought up among horses,<br> English horses.<br> Epsom Downs was my second home.<br> Come on, come on.<br> What do you think this is, bush week?<br> I wonder where<br> the nearest race course is?<br> We could clean up a packet<br> if Paddy'd race him.<br> Come on. You're like<br> a lot of flaming old hens!<br> Can't you just see us, darl?<br> Still moving, going from track to track.<br> The Carmodys, not just drovers anymore,<br> but racehorse owners.<br> Come down to earth. You'll be<br> winning the Melbourne Cup next.<br> Well, why not?<br> Did you ever dream you'd have<br> - ... besides owning a racehorse?<br> - We'll have to name the brute.<br> Hey, that's right.<br> We could call him Dynamite.<br> Or what about Fireball?<br> Fireball? Grotesque.<br> No, no. Something classical<br> would be more appropriate.<br> Wait. Why don't we call him<br> Sundowner?<br> Yeah, I like that.<br> Sundowner. What does that mean?<br> I've been called that on occasion.<br> I assumed it was a term of abuse.<br> No, that's the Australian word<br> for people like us.<br> A sundowner is someone whose home<br> is where the sun goes down.<br> It's the same as saying<br> someone who doesn't have a home.<br> Quinlan's gonna sack you<br> if this keeps up.<br> Old friend Quinlan<br> is the least of my worries.<br> Care for a cuppa?<br> You're very chipper.<br> Is it the prospect of wandering...<br> ...from race course to race course<br> which delights you?<br> Or Bulinga, with its farm for sale?<br> If Paddy knew what was in my mind,<br> he'd be scared to death.<br> I want him to look at the farm<br> before he gets his back up.<br> Now, since this is nosy day<br> at Wattle Run...<br> ...what are you gonna do<br> about Mrs. Firth?<br> Mrs. Firth? I'm going to say goodbye<br> to Mrs. Firth.<br> She's a dear little body, isn't she?<br> I just hope I don't hurt her feelings.<br> Don't you worry about her losing you.<br> She isn't losing one damned thing.<br> - Ida, I thought you were my friend.<br> - I am your friend.<br> - I just don't like you much right now.<br> - I don't like myself very much.<br> Perhaps it would be better if I didn't<br> accompany your family to Bulinga.<br> We'd be glad to have you,<br> and you know it.<br> Though why you want to beats me.<br> Well, I'm a kind of elderly turtle, Ida.<br> Hard shell, soft belly,<br> wealth of experience.<br> Not much of a mind to make use of it.<br> Always in the soup.<br> No joke intended.<br> And this turtle can't share its shell<br> with anyone.<br> But only when it finds people<br> who really belong to each other...<br> ...as Paddy and you do...<br> ...it becomes attached,<br> like a household pet.<br> Not a very well-trained one at that.<br> Oh, go on with you, Rupe.<br> Liz, you think the train trip<br> will be too much?<br> Not nearly as much<br> as all this saying goodbye.<br> Here.<br> Hopeless.<br> Hey, look at Ollie.<br> Three times now<br> he's run back to the cook house.<br> I don't think he wants to go.<br> I don't feel so good meself.<br> Listen, Sean,<br> there's something I wanna say.<br> I just hope my kid turns out<br> to be like you.<br> - Hey, Bluey.<br> - Yeah.<br> You hear the latest?<br> Ocker's thinking of getting married.<br> What's so funny about it?<br> I've been engaged eight years<br> trying to decide.<br> Speaking of getting married,<br> I hope the great lover's getting an earful.<br> Now then, Rupe, we've had<br> a lot of fun, and no harm done.<br> And why you're getting this<br> hangdog look, I don't know.<br> All I want to say to you is...<br> ...drop in again sometime,<br> and take your chances.<br> Couldn't pin him down.<br> Not without breaking his leg.<br> Well, someone's gotta take the plunge.<br> - Hooroo.<br> - Hooroo, Turk.<br> Be seeing you.<br> Everybody for the track, in the truck.<br> Next stop, Big Billabong<br> and another 50,000 wooly jumbucks.<br> Goodbye. Goodbye.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Come on, Sean! Come on!<br> Yes! Marvelous!<br> Look at the chest on him, huh?<br> What do you think of him, Ern?<br> I'd swap the missus for him<br> any day in the week.<br> He'll pay for that.<br> All the same, he's a real champ.<br> He'll stand a chance being a champ<br> if we start at the Bulinga Cup.<br> You can camp right on the farm, Ida.<br> Just drop in on the agent as you pass<br> through Bulinga. I told him you would.<br> - What farm?<br> - Oh, the Owens' farm.<br> The one Sean and I were so keen on.<br> Annie wrote me it was still for sale.<br> It's a nice little place, Paddy.<br> You can grow anything on it.<br> I didn't think there'd be any harm<br> taking a look at it, darl.<br> Well, looks like I got the Sundowner<br> just in time.<br> Otherwise you'd have me<br> pinned under a mortgage...<br> ...faster than you can say Bulinga.<br> But as you do have the Sundowner,<br> why don't you camp at the farm?<br> Then he can have a good roll in the sand.<br> It'll fix up just lovely, a room like this.<br> It's the kitchen I wanna see.<br> Oh, my.<br> Hey, they even left two beds<br> in one of the bedrooms.<br> Why don't we stay<br> in the house tonight?<br> Because it don't belong to us.<br> Sean, run out<br> and get my bag, will you?<br> Do you like the place?<br> It's a nice enough spread,<br> all right, yeah.<br> What's a place like this cost?<br> Two thousand's the asking price for it.<br> Two thou-?<br> You ought to have your head read.<br> Now, why do you make yourself<br> and Sean feel bad?<br> We ain't got money like that.<br> Yes, we have, Paddy.<br> We've got enough for a down payment.<br> I thought maybe we could<br> risk some tomorrow on Sundowner...<br> ...to get us started with the farm.<br> You reckon he's a sure thing.<br> You know how I feel about settling.<br> Look, Paddy, you can't race Sundowner<br> for the rest of your life.<br> If you stay here,<br> you can put him out to stud.<br> Did you ever see a better place<br> for raising horses?<br> Stay here, you could have<br> the time of your life.<br> It's still getting stuck.<br> Rupe says he's off<br> to the fleshpots of Bulinga.<br> What do you think, Dad?<br> Well, it makes sense, don't it?<br> Suppose I better say yes.<br> - Oh, Paddy.<br> - We'll see the agent in the morning.<br> Well, I guess I better get in town<br> and get our bets down...<br> ...before the odds shorten.<br> Yeah.<br> - How much?<br> - Fifty'll be all right.<br> Right. Well, see you later.<br> When'll you be back, darl?<br> Around sundown?<br> Soon as I can.<br> Did he mean it?<br> Yeah. Yes, he meant it.<br> Otherwise, he wouldn't have said it.<br> Well, he didn't seem too happy.<br> It's hard for him<br> to get used to the idea.<br> He'll like it later, though.<br> I bet he'll like it.<br> Of course he'll like it.<br> - Now can we stay in the house?<br> - I don't see why not.<br> Paddy?<br> Paddy?<br> I've done something, Ide.<br> I lost the money. Two-up.<br> We still got the money in the jar.<br> I wrote IOU's. I lost it all.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> I looked at you both, you and Sean.<br> You were just like strangers.<br> I wanted you to have<br> what you wanted...<br> ...but God forgive me,<br> I must've hated you both.<br> I just wanted to get away from you, get<br> drunk, get the taste out of me mouth.<br> That's all I meant to do, darl,<br> was just get drunk.<br> That's all I meant to do.<br> I'll make it up to you, darl.<br> I promise you.<br> - I'll get you a place.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Don't talk about it.<br> Don't talk about it.<br> If it's of any use to you,<br> I've got about a hundred pounds.<br> Oh, they'd never take that<br> as a down payment.<br> Thanks, anyway.<br> Just by way of covering<br> all the possibilities...<br> ...you could sell Sundowner<br> for a goodly sum.<br> Not before the race, you couldn't.<br> You'll need this to settle the IOU's.<br> Will we have enough<br> to get us another job?<br> Well, there's 50 pounds prize money<br> if Sundowner wins the race.<br> We better leave<br> right after the race, then.<br> Come on!<br> Did he win?<br> He had to, darl. He just had to.<br> Wasn't he beaut? We had to go<br> round the outside of him.<br> You'll be a better rider than I was.<br> - Two champions on that course today.<br> - And we won 200 quid.<br> We better collect our prize money,<br> start looking for another job.<br> We're not going anywhere, darl.<br> I made a deal with a bloke<br> before the race.<br> Two hundred pounds for Sundowner<br> if he wins.<br> That means we've got 400 quid.<br> We've still got enough<br> for a down payment.<br> I know what the horse means to you.<br> I know what the farm means to you, Ide.<br> You keep him.<br> Yeah, Owens' farm<br> isn't the only farm in Australia.<br> When we've earned something,<br> race him again...<br> ...and make enough money<br> for another place.<br> You know what I'm like<br> when I've got a little money.<br> - I don't trust myself, Ide.<br> - I trust you, darl.<br> We're not selling the horse.<br> Can't I do anything in my life<br> without getting an argument from you?<br> - Mum, if Dad really wants to-<br> - Shut your gob.<br> This is between your dad<br> and me, and it's settled.<br> - Ida, you want a home, don't you?<br> - Oh, we'll have a home someday.<br> This way, if we do it,<br> you'll hate every inch of the place.<br> I don't wanna live with a martyr.<br> You're the only martyr<br> to this family's got room for?<br> - You can stop being so damn noble.<br> - Who said anything about being-?<br> A protest has been entered<br> in the last race!<br> Jockey Carmody,<br> will you report to the steward's room?<br> I'll bet on the fences.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...a change in the result<br> of the last race!<br> A protest was lodged and upheld.<br> Number 17, The Sundowner...<br> ...and number 8, Billabong,<br> are disqualified for interference!<br> The winner is now Cassidy Sheila!<br> Well, you can't expect justice<br> on a provincial course.<br> All right, where's the cow<br> that squealed?<br> Who's running this race track, anyway,<br> a mob of bush rangers?<br> Flaming robbers<br> couldn't conduct a bazaar for-<br> Well, there goes both<br> our chances to be noble.<br> Hey, Carmody.<br> He didn't do it so good,<br> but I tell what.<br> I'll give you 25 quid for him.<br> Oh, take off, friend.<br> The horse is not for sale.<br> - But a deal's a deal.<br> - She's the boss.<br> Come on, you two.<br> - Coming, Rupe?<br> - Coming.<br> Twenty-five quid?<br> Lucky for you,<br> we've got a sense of humor.<br>
