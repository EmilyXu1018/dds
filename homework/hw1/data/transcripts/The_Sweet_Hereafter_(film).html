Nicole's baby-sitting tonight.<br> She'll be there around 6:00.<br> Billy, that's too early.<br> Well, she said she's gotta<br> be home by 9:00.<br> Can't you make it later?<br> Well, all right. Well...<br> I'll be waiting in the room, and...<br> you just get over<br> as soon as you can, ok?<br> OK, I guess.<br> All right, sexy.<br> I'm glad to hear<br> that Zoe's all right.<br> - Are you still in touch?<br> - Not really.<br> The last time I saw her was<br> when she was at that clinic.<br> - That was a long time ago.<br> - Which one?<br> - Which clinic?<br> - I don't remember the name.<br> It was near a beach.<br> Sunny Ridge.<br> Yes, that was a long time ago.<br> So there were others?<br> Other clinics? Oh, sure.<br> Clinics, halfway houses,<br> treatment centers, detox units.<br> So when did she get better?<br> She didn't.<br> - Oh, I thought you said...<br> - That's why I'm going to see her now.<br> She's in trouble?<br> You find there's something<br> strange about this meat?<br> Excuse me.<br> Some more wine?<br> No, I think this meat's<br> a little overdone for me.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Stephens.<br> Would you like to try the fish plate?<br> - What is it?<br> - Poached salmon.<br> - Do you have a cold plate?<br> - We do.<br> - Is there shrimp on it?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, if you take the shrimp off,<br> as well as anything else touching it,<br> I'd be grateful.<br> I'm not sure that's gonna<br> leave much on the plate.<br> Let's just see what we get,<br> shall we?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Will you excuse me?<br> Mrs. Otto?<br> My name is Mitchell Stephens.<br> The Walkers told me that<br> you might be willing to talk to me.<br> I'm really sorry to come over<br> unannounced like this,<br> but the Walkers said<br> that you'd understand.<br> I know it's an awful time,<br> but it is important<br> that we talk.<br> Who are you?<br> I'm a lawyer.<br> Look, I'm sorry,<br> you can't come in here.<br> Please, let me explain.<br> I'll only take a moment of your time.<br> Hartley?<br> We have a guest.<br> What did you say your name was?<br> Mitchell Stephens.<br> The Walkers sent him by.<br> Would you like a cup of tea<br> or something?<br> A cup of tea would be nice.<br> Alright if I sit down for a few minutes?<br> I wanna talk to you.<br> The Walkers spoke very highly of you.<br> You've been retained.<br> Their child died,<br> and they got a lawyer?<br> It should be set that my task<br> is to represent the Walkers...<br> only in their anger,<br> not their grief.<br> Who did they get for that?<br> You're angry,<br> aren't you, Mrs. Otto?<br> That's why I'm here.<br> To give your anger a voice.<br> To be your weapon<br> against whoever...<br> caused that bus<br> to go off the road.<br> Dolores?<br> It's my belief that Dolores was doing<br> exactly what she's done for years.<br> Besides, the school board's<br> insurance on Dolores was minimal,<br> a few million at most.<br> Now, the really deep pockets<br> are in the town...<br> or the company<br> that made the bus.<br> So you think someone else<br> caused the accident, Mr. Stevens?<br> Mrs. Otto, there is<br> no such thing as an accident.<br> The word doesn't mean<br> anything to me.<br> As far as I'm concerned,<br> somebody somewhere made<br> a decision to cut a corner.<br> Some corrupt agency<br> or corporation...<br> accounted the cost variance<br> between a 10-cent bolt...<br> and a million-dollar<br> out-of-court settlement.<br> They decided to sacrifice<br> a few lives for the difference.<br> That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.<br> I've seen it happen<br> so many times before.<br> But Dolores said<br> she hit a patch of ice...<br> and lost control of the bus.<br> Mr. Otto, how long has Dolores<br> been driving that bus?<br> How many times has she<br> steered clear of danger?<br> I mean, what happened<br> that morning?<br> Somebody calculated<br> ahead of time...<br> what it would cost<br> to sacrifice safety.<br> It's the darkest, most cynical<br> thing you can imagine,<br> but it's absolutely true.<br> And now, it's up to me...<br> to ensure moral responsibility<br> in this society.<br> So you're just the thing we need.<br> Isn't that what you want us<br> to believe, Mr. Stevens?<br> That you know what's best for us?<br> Now, you listen to me, Mrs. Otto...<br> and you listen very carefully.<br> I do know what's best,<br> believe me.<br> As we're sitting here talking,<br> the town...<br> or the school board...<br> or the manufacturer<br> of that bus...<br> are lining up a battery<br> of their own lawyers...<br> to negotiate with people<br> as grief-stricken as yourselves.<br> And that makes me very,<br> very mad.<br> That's why I came<br> all the way up here.<br> If everyone had done<br> their job with integrity,<br> your son would be alive and<br> safely in school this morning.<br> I promise that I will<br> pursue and reveal...<br> who it was<br> did not do their job...<br> who is responsible for this...<br> tragedy.<br> And then in your name,<br> the Walkers' name...<br> in the name of whoever<br> decides to join us, I will sue.<br> I will sue for negligence<br> until they bleed.<br> I want that person<br> to go to jail...<br> for the rest of his life.<br> I want him...<br> to die there.<br> I don't want his money.<br> It isn't likely that anyone<br> will go to prison, Mrs. Otto.<br> But he or his company<br> will pay in other ways,<br> and we must make them pay.<br> Not for the money or compensation<br> for the loss of your boy...<br> that can't be done.<br> But for the protection<br> of other innocent children.<br> You see, I'm not just here<br> to speak for your anger,<br> but for the future as well.<br> Are you expensive?<br> If you agree to have me<br> represent you in this suit,<br> I will require no payment<br> until the case is won,<br> when I will require 1/3<br> of the awarded amount.<br> If no award is made,<br> then my services to you...<br> will cost you<br> absolutely nothing.<br> That's the standard agreement.<br> Do you have<br> this agreement with you?<br> Yes, I do. It's in my car.<br> I won't be a minute.<br> In any case,<br> you should have time...<br> to discuss this without me<br> before you make a decision.<br> I did everything a loving father<br> of a drug addict...<br> is supposed to do.<br> I sent her to the best hospitals,<br> saw the best doctors.<br> Two weeks later,<br> she'd be out on the street.<br> The next time I saw her<br> would be a phone call for money.<br> Money for school, money<br> for some new kind of therapist,<br> money for a plane ticket home.<br> "Oh, Daddy,<br> please let me come home.<br> "I need to see you."<br> But she never came home.<br> I was always at the airport,<br> but she was never there.<br> Had 10 years of this,<br> Wondering what would happen<br> if I didn't send the money.<br> Kicking down doors,<br> dragging her out of<br> rat-infested apartments.<br> Explaining to somebody that<br> couldn't possibly be my daughter...<br> that they saw in a porn flick.<br> Enough rage and helplessness, and<br> your love turns to something else.<br> What does it turn to?<br> It turns to steaming piss.<br> They just had supper.<br> - Yeah? Was it good?<br> - All right, be good.<br> Was it good? Of course it was good.<br> I'll be back before 9:00, ok?<br> Let's go!<br> Have you been waiting long?<br> - A while.<br> - Billy, do you have to smoke?<br> Wendell can smell<br> if someone's been smoking.<br> What's all this?<br> Wendell put some fresh enamel<br> on that break in the tub.<br> - This means I can't have a shower?<br> - No. Should be dry by now.<br> When's he getting back?<br> After the game, I guess.<br> Oh, the game.<br> "The Pied Piper of Hamelin."<br> "Hamelin town's in Brunswick,<br> by famous Hanover city.<br> "The river Weser<br> deep and wide...<br> "washes its wall<br> on the southern side.<br> "A pleasanter spot<br> you never spied,<br> "but when begins my ditty..."<br> - What's a ditty again?<br> It's like a song.<br> "Almost 500 years ago,<br> "to see the townsfolk suffer so<br> from vermin was a pity."<br> - What's vermin again?<br> - Rats.<br> "They fought the dogs<br> and killed the cats...<br> "and bit the babies<br> in the cradles...<br> "and ate the cheeses<br> out of the vats...<br> "and licked the soup<br> from the cooks' own ladles.<br> "Split open the kegs<br> of salted sprats,<br> "made nests inside<br> men's Sunday hats,<br> "and even spoiled<br> the women's chats...<br> "by drowning their speaking<br> with shrieking and squeaking...<br> "in 50 different sharps and flats."<br> - Nicole?<br> - Yes, Mason?<br> Can I sit beside you<br> on the bus tomorrow?<br> Won't you sit at the back<br> to wave at your dad?<br> - I want to sit beside you tomorrow.<br> - Ok.<br> Did the Pied Piper<br> take the children away...<br> because he was mad<br> the town didn't pay him?<br> That's right.<br> Well, if he knew magic,<br> if he could get the kids<br> into the mountain,<br> why couldn't he use<br> his magic pipe...<br> to make the people pay him<br> for getting rid of the rats?<br> Because...<br> he wanted them to be punished.<br> So he was mean?<br> No, not mean. Just...<br> just very...<br> very angry.<br> - Should I keep reading?<br> - Yeah.<br> What are you thinking?<br> Tomorrow I'm gonna<br> put Sean on the bus,<br> and he won't want to go.<br> He never does.<br> He'll cry...<br> He won't want to let go of me.<br> Well, it's 'cause he misses you.<br> It's natural.<br> Your kids never cry.<br> Well, it's probably 'cause they know<br> I'll be following them behind the bus.<br> They can look forward to that.<br> Just like we<br> look forward to this.<br> You're leaving?<br> Yeah, I'd better get back.<br> Like I said,<br> Nicole has to be home by...<br> Good night, Billy.<br> Good night, Risa.<br> Are you sure?<br> It just seems kind of weird.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't know.<br> Listen, Nicole, I'm just gonna<br> take this stuff and pack it...<br> and give it to<br> the church for charity.<br> Don't feel bad.<br> Unless you feel strange<br> about wearing it...<br> No. I mean, I...<br> I remember Mrs. Ansell<br> wearing some of this stuff,<br> but I don't feel weird<br> about that.<br> I really liked her.<br> She really liked you.<br> I think she probably would have<br> given you that stuff herself...<br> if she hadn't outgrown it.<br> What do you mean, outgrown it?<br> I'm not sure.<br> Hey, I ran through that tune<br> you guys were working on.<br> I came up with<br> a couple of ideas.<br> Show it to the guys,<br> see what they say.<br> That's great. Thank you.<br> "There was a rustling<br> that seemed like a bustling...<br> "of merry crowds jostling<br> and pitching and hustling.<br> "Small feet were pattering,<br> wooden shoes clattering,<br> "little hands clapping,<br> and little tongues chattering.<br> "And like fowls in a farmyard<br> when barley is scattering,<br> "out came the children running.<br> "All the little boys and girls,<br> "with rosy cheeks<br> and flaxen curls,<br> "and sparkling eyes<br> and teeth like pearls,<br> "tripping and skipping,<br> "ran merrily after...<br> "the wonderful music,<br> the shouting and laughter."<br> "When, lo, as they reached<br> the mountainside..."<br> "a wondrous portal<br> opened wide..."<br> "as if a cavern<br> were suddenly hollowed,<br> "and the piper advanced<br> and the children followed."<br> "And when all were in<br> to the very last..."<br> "the door in the mountainside<br> shut fast."<br> "Did I say all?<br> "No. One was lame..."<br> "and could not dance<br> the whole of the way."<br> "And in after years,<br> if you would blame his sadness,<br> "he was used to say..."<br> "It's dull in our town<br> since my playmates left."<br> "I can't forget<br> that I'm bereft...<br> "of all the pleasant sights<br> they see,<br> "which the piper<br> also promised me."<br> "For he led us, he said,<br> to a joyous land..."<br> "joining the town<br> and just at hand..."<br> "where waters gushed<br> and fruit trees grew..."<br> "and flowers put forth<br> a fairer hue..."<br> "and everything<br> was strange and new."<br> By the time I reached the bottom<br> of Bartlett Hill Road,<br> I had half my load.<br> Let's see... 20.<br> No. 22 kids aboard.<br> They'd walk to their places<br> on the main road,<br> from the smaller lanes<br> and private roadways...<br> that run off it.<br> Bright little clusters<br> of three and four children...<br> like berries<br> waiting to be plucked.<br> That's the way I thought<br> of them sometimes.<br> - Like berries?<br> - Yup.<br> Like I was putting them<br> into my big basket,<br> clearing the hillside<br> of its children.<br> Anyway, my next stop was<br> across from the Bide-A-While,<br> which is owned and operated<br> by Risa and Wendell Walker.<br> Risa had walked<br> her son Sean across the road,<br> which was customary.<br> Sean, he has some kind of<br> learning disability.<br> Well, he's behind the rest<br> of the kids his age in school,<br> and he's too nervous<br> to play sports.<br> Strange little guy.<br> But, you know, you couldn't help<br> but like him.<br> Morning, Dolores.<br> Hi, Risa.<br> Aren't your feet freezing?<br> I guess they are.<br> I want to stay with you.<br> Sean... go on, honey. Go on.<br> Come on, Sean, sit next to me.<br> - Is he ok?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Temperature?<br> - No, he's not sick or anything.<br> Just one of those mornings,<br> I guess. You know?<br> Well, I never had<br> those mornings, myself.<br> Not so long as I had<br> my school bus to drive...<br> not so long<br> as I had my... kids.<br> You ok there, Sean?<br> Looking forward to school?<br> You settle down back there!<br> You'll be walking to school<br> if you're not careful.<br> Don't want that. It's<br> a cold day out there, eh, Bear?<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> You know, every time I go on<br> one of these flights to rescue Zoe,<br> I remember the summer<br> we almost lost her.<br> She was three years old.<br> It happened one morning<br> at this cottage we used to rent.<br> We were all together,<br> sleeping in bed.<br> It was a wonderful time<br> in our lives.<br> We still felt we had a future<br> together, the three of us.<br> Did you ever visit<br> that cottage?<br> I don't think so.<br> I remember I was...<br> awakened by the sound of<br> Zoe's breathing. It was labored.<br> I looked across<br> and noticed that...<br> she was sweating...<br> and all swollen, and I...<br> I grabbed her<br> and rushed in the kitchen...<br> and splashed some water<br> on her face.<br> - What happened?<br> - I didn't know.<br> I was in a complete panic.<br> I guess she'd been<br> bitten by some insect.<br> But there was no doctor.<br> The nearest hospital<br> was 40 miles away,<br> and she was continuing<br> to swell up...<br> Clara took her in her arms<br> and tried to breast-feed her...<br> while I dialed the hospital.<br> I finally got a doctor.<br> He surmised that<br> there was a nest...<br> of baby black widow spiders<br> in the mattress.<br> He said they had to be babies,<br> or else, with Zoe's body weight,<br> she'd be dead.<br> He said I had to rush her<br> to the hospital.<br> He said, "Mr. Stephens,<br> there's a good chance...<br> "that you won't get her here<br> before her throat closes.<br> "It's very important<br> that you keep her calm."<br> Then he asked if there was one of us<br> she was more relaxed with,<br> and I said, "Yes. Me,"<br> which was true enough, because...<br> at that particular moment,<br> Clara's eyes were wild with fear,<br> and fear was contagious.<br> I was a better actor,<br> that's all.<br> And Zoe...<br> loved us equally then.<br> Just as she hates us<br> both equally now.<br> Anyway, the doctor said that<br> I had to hold her on my lap...<br> and let Clara drive<br> to the hospital.<br> He asked me to bring<br> a small, sharp knife.<br> He said it had to be clean.<br> There was no...<br> time to sterilize properly.<br> He explained how to perform<br> an emergency tracheotomy...<br> how to cut into her throat<br> without her bleeding to death.<br> He said there would be blood, and<br> I said I didn't think I could do it.<br> He said, "Mr. Stephens..."<br> "If her throat closes up and<br> breathing stops, you're gonna have to."<br> "You'll have about<br> a minute and a half, or 2 minutes,<br> "and she'll probably be<br> unconscious when you do it."<br> "But if you manage to keep her<br> calm and relaxed..."<br> "and not let her little heart<br> beat too fast..."<br> "and spread<br> the poison around..."<br> "you might just<br> make it here first.<br> "Now, you get going,"<br> he said, and he hung up.<br> It was an unforgettable drive.<br> I was... divided into two parts.<br> One part was daddy, singing<br> a lullaby to his little girl...<br> and the other part was...<br> a surgeon with a knife,<br> ready to cut into her throat.<br> I waited for the second<br> Zoe's breath stopped...<br> to make the incision.<br> What happened?<br> What happened?<br> Oh, nothing.<br> We got to the hospital in time.<br> I did not have to go as far<br> as I was prepared to go.<br> But I was prepared<br> to go all the way.<br> I knew you'd be here.<br> - Are you going to the funeral?<br> - I stopped by the station a while ago and...<br> stared at the bus.<br> Almost hear the kids inside.<br> There was lawyer there,<br> who said...<br> he'd gotten you signed up.<br> Is that true?<br> Something made this happen.<br> Mr. Stevens said he'd find out...<br> What are you talking about?<br> It was an accident.<br> Mr. Stephens said that someone<br> put a wrong bolt in the bus.<br> I serviced the bus at the garage.<br> There was nothing wrong with it.<br> Or that the guardrail<br> wasn't strong enough.<br> You believe that?<br> I have to.<br> - Why?<br> - Because I have to.<br> I don't.<br> Is it true you gave Nicole<br> one of Lydia's sweaters...<br> and she was wearing it<br> when the bus crashed?<br> Why'd you do that, Billy?<br> You think that caused<br> the accident?<br> That it brought bad luck?<br> You're looking for<br> a witch doctor, not a lawyer.<br> Maybe they're the same thing.<br> You know what I'm gonna miss...<br> more than making love?<br> The nights you couldn't<br> get away from Wendell.<br> I'd sit in that chair<br> for an hour...<br> smoking a cigarette,<br> remembering my life before.<br> The mind is kind.<br> - You are so lucky.<br> - Don't even try to remember.<br> You just think about<br> getting well, Nicole. That's all.<br> You just wait till you see what<br> we got waiting for you at home.<br> How do you like it, Nicole?<br> - The ramp?<br> - It's pretty slick, eh?<br> - Very slick.<br> - You like the color?<br> - It's OK.<br> - I could use a different color, if you like.<br> It'd be real easy to do.<br> I don't know about that green.<br> I'm not too sure<br> about that color.<br> And I'll widen a few doors, too.<br> You'll see.<br> Hello?<br> Hi, Mitch.<br> We just brought her home.<br> She's doing fine.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> She hasn't seen it yet.<br> We haven't talked about it.<br> OK, great, Mitch. Right.<br> - What do you think?<br> - The door needs a lock.<br> Sure. I'll fix that right away.<br> - Can I come and visit you here?<br> - You better.<br> You can sleep with me<br> in my bed too, ok?<br> It's too high.<br> I'll never reach it.<br> I'd better get some spackle.<br> So... do you like your new room?<br> It's interesting.<br> Your dad spent all<br> his spare time in here.<br> He wanted it to be<br> absolutely perfect.<br> I feel like a princess.<br> What's that?<br> It is...<br> a present.<br> From you?<br> No. From Mr. Stephens.<br> That was him on the phone just now.<br> - He called to find out how you were.<br> - Who's Mr. Stephens?<br> - He's a lawyer. He's our lawyer.<br> - You and mom have a lawyer?<br> - He's your lawyer, too.<br> - My lawyer.<br> Why do I need a lawyer?<br> Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this<br> just now, with you barely home.<br> Aren't you hungry, honey?<br> I'll fix you something.<br> What's this lawyer business?<br> He's a very kind man.<br> And he knew that you'd need<br> a computer for doing schoolwork.<br> - It's even got a thing...<br> - Program.<br> ...program on it to help you<br> compose your songs.<br> "Fathers, mothers..."<br> "uncles, cousins..."<br> "families by tens and dozens..."<br> "brothers, sisters..."<br> "husbands, wives..."<br> "followed the piper<br> for their lives."<br> I've been wanting to meet you<br> for a long time.<br> Not just because of all the good<br> things I've heard about you.<br> But because...<br> well, I'm the guy<br> who's representing you...<br> and your mom and dad<br> and several people in town.<br> We're trying to generate,<br> however meager,<br> some compensation...<br> for what you've suffered.<br> At the same time...<br> to make sure that an accident<br> like this never happens again.<br> I don't like thinking<br> about the accident.<br> I don't even<br> remember it happening.<br> Besides...<br> It just makes people<br> feel sorry for me, and...<br> - You hate that.<br> - What she means...<br> People can't help it.<br> I mean, they see you<br> in this wheelchair...<br> they're going to<br> feel sorry for you.<br> I didn't know you...<br> nor how promising and exciting<br> your life was before the accident.<br> But listen, even I feel sorry for you.<br> What is it that you want me<br> to do for you, Mr. Stephens?<br> They work for the people<br> that we're trying to sue.<br> See, their job is to<br> minimize damages,<br> and ours is to try<br> and maximize them.<br> That's the way you have<br> to think about it, Nicole,<br> as people doing their jobs.<br> There's no good guys<br> or bad guys.<br> There's just their side<br> and our side.<br> - I won't lie.<br> - I don't want you to lie.<br> No matter what I'm asked,<br> I'll tell the truth.<br> Of course.<br> I need you to tell the truth.<br> And I'll be right there<br> to advise you.<br> There'll be a court stenographer<br> who will record everything.<br> That's what will go<br> to the judge before the trial.<br> It'll be the same for everyone.<br> They'll be deposing<br> the Ottos, the Walkers,<br> Dolores, your mom and dad.<br> - But I'll make sure that you go last.<br> - Why?<br> So as you can<br> go on getting well,<br> so that you're able<br> to get up there and do this.<br> Because it's not going to be easy.<br> You do understand that?<br> When do they award the damages?<br> That depends. It could<br> drag on for quite a while.<br> We'll be there at the end,<br> Sam, don't you worry.<br> I'm here about your children,<br> Mr. Ansell.<br> - My name...<br> - I don't want to know your name.<br> I understand.<br> No, you don't.<br> Get the fuck away from the bus.<br> I can help you.<br> Not unless you can<br> raise the dead.<br> Here. You may change your mind.<br> Mitchell Stephens,<br> Esquire, tell me,<br> would you sue me if<br> I was to beat you right now?<br> I mean beat you so bad you'd<br> piss blood and couldn't walk for a month.<br> That's what I'm about to do.<br> - No, Mr. Ansell. I wouldn't sue you.<br> - You leave us alone, Stephens.<br> You leave the people<br> of this town alone.<br> - You can't help.<br> - You can help each other.<br> Several people in the town...<br> have agreed to let me represent<br> them in a negligence suit.<br> Your case as an individual<br> will be stronger...<br> if I'm allowed to represent you<br> together as a group.<br> Case?<br> The Walkers have agreed,<br> and the Ottos have agreed...<br> Nicole Burnell's parents.<br> It's important that we<br> initiate proceedings right away.<br> Things get covered up.<br> People lie.<br> That's why we must begin<br> our investigation quickly,<br> before the evidence disappears.<br> - That's what I'm doing...<br> - Listen.<br> I know Risa and Wendell Walker.<br> They wouldn't hire<br> a goddamn lawyer.<br> The Ottos,<br> they wouldn't deal with you.<br> We're not country bumpkins<br> you can put the big city hustle on.<br> You're angry, Mr. Ansell, and you<br> owe it to yourself to feel that way.<br> All I'm saying is...<br> let me direct your rage.<br> That's my daughter.<br> Or it may be the police to tell me<br> they've found her dead.<br> She's a drug addict.<br> Why are you telling me this?<br> Why am I telling you this?<br> Because we've all<br> lost our children.<br> They're dead to us.<br> They're killing each other<br> in the streets.<br> They wander, comatose...<br> shopping malls.<br> Something terrible has happened.<br> It's taken our children away.<br> It's too late.<br> They're gone.<br> Collect call from Zoe.<br> Will you accept the charges?<br> Daddy?<br> I'm calling because I've got<br> some news for you, Daddy.<br> - Some big news.<br> - News?<br> Don't you want to hear?<br> Yes, give me the news, Zoe.<br> You always think you know what I'm<br> gonna say before I say it, don't you, Daddy?<br> You always think you're one step<br> ahead of me. The lawyer.<br> Tell me your news, Zoe.<br> Ok. Yesterday,<br> I went to sell my blood.<br> That's how it is.<br> I'm in this fucking city,<br> and I'm selling my blood.<br> That's not news, Zoe.<br> No, but this is.<br> They wouldn't take my blood.<br> Do you know what that means,<br> Daddy? Does it register?<br> I tested positive.<br> Welcome to hard times, Daddy.<br> What do you want me to do, Zoe?<br> I'll do whatever you want.<br> - I need money.<br> - What for?<br> No, you cannot ask me that,<br> not anymore.<br> You asked what I wanted, not<br> what I wanted it for. I want money.<br> - Did you have a blood test?<br> - You don't believe me?<br> - You don't fucking believe me?<br> - Of course I believe you.<br> I just thought<br> I'd get you another test...<br> in case the one you got<br> was wrong.<br> I like you when you<br> don't believe me, Daddy.<br> It's better that you don't believe me,<br> but have to act like you do.<br> I can hear you breathing, Daddy.<br> Yes, I can hear you breathing, too.<br> Oh, God, I'm scared.<br> I love you, Zoe.<br> I'll soon be there.<br> I'll take care of you.<br> No matter what happens,<br> I'll take care of you.<br> - I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.<br> - Yes, Dolores. What is it?<br> I told you that I was doing<br> when the bus went over.<br> And that's how I remembered it.<br> But how can I prove that?<br> Billy Ansell will insist that you<br> were doing 50 miles an hour...<br> just like you've done every<br> morning for the past 15 years.<br> - He knows that? Billy?<br> - Yes, he does.<br> - He said that? You talked to Billy?<br> - I did.<br> - And he told you that he'd say that...<br> - Mrs. Driscoll...<br> If Billy does not volunteer<br> to say so in court,<br> then I will subpoena him and<br> oblige him to testify to that effect.<br> But in order to do that,<br> you have to let me bring<br> a suit in your name...<br> charging negligent infliction<br> of emotional harm.<br> Because what is so obvious to me<br> and to other people...<br> is the magnitude, the sheer<br> magnitude of your suffering.<br> - What other people?<br> - Excuse me?<br> Who has been talking to you<br> about what I am feeling?<br> Who should care about<br> what I'm feeling?<br> Dolores, people have to know<br> about your suffering,<br> and they won't understand<br> until I can clear your name,<br> your good name,<br> once and for all.<br> Now, will you let me do this?<br> Will you let me do my duty?<br> You heard what Abbott said.<br> Abbott said the true jury<br> of a person's peers...<br> is the people of her town.<br> Only they, the people who<br> have known her all her life,<br> and not 12 strangers, can decide<br> her guilt or innocence.<br> That's what he said, is it?<br> Abbott understands these things.<br> I remember...<br> wrenching the steering<br> wheel to my left...<br> and slapping my foot<br> against the brake pedal.<br> I wasn't the driver anymore.<br> The bus was like this...<br> huge wave...<br> about to break over us.<br> Bear Otto.<br> The Landston kids.<br> The Hamiltons.<br> The Prescotts.<br> The teenaged boys and girls<br> from Bartlett Hill Road.<br> Pete.<br> Susie.<br> Laurel.<br> Rick.<br> Sean Walker.<br> Nicole Burnell.<br> Billy Ansell's twins...<br> Jessica and Mason.<br> All the children of my town.<br> Then what happened?<br> Hey, Billy, come on in.<br> Take a load off.<br> Would you like<br> a cup of tea, Billy?<br> There's a piece of cake for you.<br> No. No, thanks, Mary.<br> So, what brings you out tonight?<br> Well, I'll tell you the truth, Sam.<br> It's about this lawsuit that<br> you got yourself all involved with.<br> I'd like you to drop the damn thing.<br> That doesn't really concern you, Bill.<br> - Well, it does concern me.<br> - Don't know why it should.<br> I mean, there's a whole<br> lot of people in this town...<br> who got involved with lawsuits.<br> We're hardly unique here, Billy.<br> I mean, I can understand<br> how you feel.<br> How?<br> Well, it being so depressing and all.<br> That's reality.<br> Can't just turn this off...<br> because you happen to think<br> it's a bad idea.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because it's what we have to do.<br> Well, I don't want<br> a thing to do with it.<br> Ok, fine. So stay out of it.<br> I've tried to stay out of it.<br> Turns out that's not so easy.<br> Cause you've gone and got yourself<br> this lawyer, Mitchell Stephens.<br> So? I mean, lots of folks<br> got lawyers.<br> But he's the one<br> who will subpoena me, Sam.<br> He's gonna force me<br> to testify in court.<br> He came by the garage<br> this afternoon.<br> - Gave me that slip of paper.<br> - Why would he do that?<br> I mean, you didn't have anything<br> to do with the accident.<br> Because I was driving<br> behind the bus.<br> I saw it happen. Now if that<br> son of a bitch does subpoena me...<br> and forces me to go over<br> all of this again,<br> then all those other lawyers<br> are gonna line up behind him...<br> ...and try to do the same thing.<br> - That's not gonna happen, Billy.<br> Mitch Stephens' case is small<br> compared to some of these guys'.<br> The way he told me,<br> all he needs is for you to say<br> what you saw that day...<br> driving behind the bus.<br> I know it's painful thing to do, but...<br> There's lawyers suing lawyers...<br> because some people were<br> stupid enough to sign on...<br> with more than one<br> of the bastards.<br> There's people pointing fingers<br> and making side deals...<br> dickering over percentages.<br> You know, if you two<br> drop the case,<br> then the others will<br> come to their senses.<br> You're good, sensible parents,<br> you and Mary.<br> People respect you.<br> We can't drop the lawsuit.<br> I mean, you know how much<br> we need the money.<br> Why? You got the money from Dolores'<br> insurance with the school board.<br> - We all did.<br> - That's not enough.<br> And for the hospital bills for Nicole.<br> I'll help you pay for Nicole...<br> if that's what you're<br> really talking about.<br> I'll even give you the money<br> I got for my kids.<br> That's what we used to do,<br> remember?<br> Help each other.<br> 'Cause this was a community.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - How is Nicole?<br> - She's resting in her room.<br> Say hello for me.<br> You know, we're getting on<br> with our lives, Billy.<br> Maybe it's time you<br> got on with yours.<br> You sleepy?<br> Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens<br> wants you to make...<br> your deposition<br> at the community center.<br> - Thought I'd take you over.<br> - Great.<br> You seem... I don't know...<br> distant, I guess.<br> Hard to talk to.<br> We didn't use to have<br> to talk a lot, did we, Daddy?<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean,<br> I'm a wheelchair girl now,<br> and it's hard to pretend<br> that I'm a beautiful rock star.<br> Remember Daddy...<br> that beautiful stage that<br> you were going to build for me?<br> You were gonna light it<br> with nothing but candles.<br> I'll take you about<br> - That's ok with you?<br> - Great.<br> "When, lo, as they reached<br> the mountainside,<br> "a wondrous portal<br> opened wide...<br> "as if a cavern was<br> suddenly hollowed.<br> "And the piper advanced,<br> and the children followed."<br> "And when all were in<br> to the very last..."<br> "the door in the mountainside<br> shut fast."<br> "Did I say all? No."<br> "One was lame...<br> "and could not dance<br> the whole of the way."<br> Now, Nicole,<br> if we could continue.<br> On that morning, did it come a time<br> when you left your parent's house?<br> And what time<br> in the morning was this?<br> About 8:30 in the morning.<br> Was there anyone waiting<br> for the bus with you?<br> I was alone.<br> My sister Jenny was sick,<br> and she stayed home that day.<br> Was there anything unusual<br> about the driver, Mrs. Driscoll,<br> or the bus<br> that particular morning?<br> Like what? I mean,<br> I don't remember a lot.<br> I object to<br> that form of question.<br> Note that, please.<br> - Was the bus on time?<br> - Yes.<br> And where did you sit<br> that particular morning?<br> My usual place... the first seat<br> on the right side.<br> And according<br> to your recollection,<br> there was nothing unusual<br> in the drive that morning?<br> Until the accident?<br> There was a brown dog that<br> ran across the road up there.<br> Dolores slowed down<br> so that she wouldn't hit it,<br> and he ran into the woods.<br> And then Dolores drove on...<br> and turned onto<br> the Marlowe Road as usual.<br> I remember that.<br> - I'm remembering pretty clearly.<br> - You are?<br> Note that she said<br> "pretty clearly", not "clearly".<br> What was the weather like<br> at this time?<br> It was snowing.<br> Unless the report from<br> the National Weather Bureau...<br> for the district<br> on December the sixth...<br> goes into the record,<br> I'm going to object<br> to that question.<br> I'll offer that report.<br> Well, then. Now that your memory<br> seems to be clearing...<br> can you tell us what else<br> you observed at that time?<br> "It's dull in our town<br> since my playmates left.<br> "I can't forget<br> that I'm bereft...<br> "of all the pleasant sights<br> they see,<br> "which the piper<br> also promised me."<br> - I was scared.<br> - Why were you scared?<br> This is before the accident, Nicole.<br> You understand what I'm asking?<br> - Yes, I understand.<br> - Why were you scared?<br> Dolores was driving too fast.<br> Mrs. Driscoll<br> was driving too fast?<br> What made you think that, Nicole?<br> The speedometer.<br> It was downhill there.<br> You could see the speedometer?<br> I looked.<br> I remember clearly now.<br> It seemed we were going<br> too fast down the hill,<br> and I was scared.<br> How fast would you say<br> Mrs. Driscoll was going,<br> to the best of your recollection?<br> Seventy-two miles an hour.<br> Seventy-two miles an hour.<br> You're sure of this?<br> Positive.<br> So you believe the bus<br> driven by Mrs. Driscoll...<br> was traveling at<br> I told you I was positive.<br> The speedometer was large and<br> easy to read from where I was.<br> You saw the speedometer?<br> Did you say anything<br> to Mrs. Driscoll?<br> No.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because I was scared.<br> And there wasn't time.<br> There wasn't time?<br> Because the bus went<br> off the road and crashed.<br> You remember this?<br> Yes.<br> I do now.<br> Now that I'm telling it.<br> Do you have any questions,<br> Mr. Stephens?<br> "And why I lied, he only knew.<br> "But from my lie,<br> this did come true."<br> "Those lips from which<br> he drew his tune..."<br> "were frozen<br> as a winter moon."<br> I have no questions.<br> I have no... no questions.<br> Thank you, Nicole.<br> You'd make<br> a great poker player, kid.<br> Thanks.<br> Let's go now, Dad.<br> I don't know what<br> she was doing in there.<br> She was lying.<br> It doesn't matter whether<br> she was lying or not.<br> The lawsuit is dead.<br> Everyone's lawsuit is dead.<br> Forget it.<br> Tell the others to forget it.<br> It is over.<br> Right now, Sam, the thing<br> you got to worry about...<br> is why she lied.<br> Now, any kid who would do that<br> to her father, is not normal, Sam.<br> Do you think he'll let us<br> keep the computer?<br> Well, it was nice meeting you<br> again, Mr. Stephens.<br> It was nice meeting you<br> again, Allie.<br> Tell Zoe I say hi.<br> I will.<br> I hope she gets better.<br> Now you watch your step, now.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Hey, good morning.<br> - Morning.<br> How are you doing?<br> Watch your step now.<br> Good morning.<br> Need any help with that case?<br> Good morning.<br> Watch your step. That's it.<br> Thank you very much. Mind your step<br> as you go up there now.<br> Thank you very much. Can I help you<br> with your case, ma'am? No?<br> Ok, thank you very much.<br> As you see her<br> two years later...<br> I wonder if you realize something.<br> I wonder if you understand<br> that all of us...<br> Dolores, me,<br> the children who survived...<br> the children who didn't...<br> that we're all citizens<br> of a different town now.<br> A place with<br> its own special rules...<br> and its own special laws.<br> A town of people living<br> in the sweet hereafter.<br> Where waters gushed<br> and fruit trees grew...<br> and flowers put forth<br> a fairer hue.<br> And everything was strange...<br> and new.<br> Everything was strange and new.<br> English<br>
