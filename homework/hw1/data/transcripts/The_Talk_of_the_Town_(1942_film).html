                        I'm convinced that this fire<br> was deliberately set.<br> But by who, Mr. Holmes?<br> By who?<br> - Dilg escaped?<br> - Escaped?<br> - Miss Shelley...<br> - One move and I'll brain you.<br> - I'd appreciate the keys to your car.<br> - Get out of here, Leopold Dilg.<br> - I'm sorry, but it's important.<br> - I'm warning you!<br> Dilg! Dilg!<br> Excuse me.<br> Dilg, what are you doing here?<br> You broke out of jail.<br> In passing, it was necessary<br> to hit me on the skull.<br> You fool, the whole police force<br> must be looking for you.<br> The whole country.<br> I'd like to stay here.<br> You can't. I'm fixing this house up<br> for rent. It'll be occupied tomorrow.<br> Why did you escape?<br> You've got to leave.<br> Come on, please.<br> What's the matter?<br> My ankle.<br> Oh, my gosh! How far do you expect<br> to get with that?<br> And where are you going?<br> I'd appreciate any suggestions.<br> Why didn't you think of that<br> in the first place?<br> Miss Shelley, do you believe<br> I could burn down a factory?<br> You're crying.<br> One day you love the whole world,<br> and all of a sudden, every...<br> No! Get upstairs, quick.<br> Quick.<br> I want you to go in the attic<br> and keep quiet, understand?<br> Close that door behind you.<br> Good evening.<br> - I am Michael Lightcap.<br> - Michael Lightcap?<br> You're supposed to arrive tomorrow.<br> Your secretary...<br> My secretary is getting married.<br> Nothing deranges a woman's mind more.<br> My entire life has been in complete<br> confusion for the last two months.<br> - You must be the person we spoke with.<br> - Yes, Nora Shelley.<br> How do you do, Miss Shelley?<br> An excellent name.<br> - Yes. It's raining, isn't it?<br> - Definitely.<br> We're having an early summer.<br> Could we talk inside?<br> It's rather damp out here.<br> Nothing is ready. I thought tomorrow<br> about noon... I suggest a hotel.<br> I planned to spend the night here,<br> so I'll spend the night here.<br> Standing under an open umbrella inside,<br> bad luck. Silly superstition, isn't it?<br> Still, in a new, strange house,<br> you never know what's liable to turn up.<br> - I've had that umbrella 11 years.<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> You have a nervous, impulsive quality<br> that I find in many of my students.<br> - Disease of the age.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'll get my bags.<br> Get up in the attic. Didn't you hear?<br> That's the new tenant!<br> You shouldn't have<br> broken his umbrella.<br> Get up in the attic.<br> Do you know who he is?<br> He's a legal genius,<br> Dean of Commonwealth Law School.<br> He eats with the governor.<br> He writes to the president.<br> Yeah, a very cold character,<br> Mr. Lightcap.<br> He's back.<br> Now remember, keep quiet.<br> - Later, out you go.<br> - I wonder where.<br> Oh, darn.<br> - Hello.<br> - Why did you lock the door?<br> Did I? Why, isn't that queer?<br> There seems to be a strange atmosphere<br> hanging over this house.<br> Soon as I get the curtains up<br> it'll be all right.<br> Yes.<br> You're a very sarcastic man,<br> aren't you?<br> I've just finished teaching,<br> for nine months...<br> ...400 weary young men<br> the rudiments of law.<br> I drove all the way down here myself...<br> ...because my man went to see<br> his ailing mother in West Virginia.<br> I had a long, hard trip and was looking<br> forward to a cheerful, bright house...<br> ...a warm bed. And I find myself,<br> on a rainy night, in this shambles.<br> I must confess, Miss Shelley, I've never<br> seen such monumental inefficiency.<br> Why didn't you tell your secretary to<br> get things right before she ran off?<br> Is it my fault you came<br> barging in here 24 hours early?<br> If you'd come tomorrow, it would have<br> been efficiently whipped together.<br> It would've been cheerful and bright.<br> - Are you through?<br> - Yes.<br> There's justice in what you say,<br> but the violence with which...<br> - I'm sorry, but...<br> - I accept your apology. Accept mine.<br> Is there a bedroom in the house<br> fit to be slept in?<br> - The master bedroom is quite fit.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I'll show you where it is.<br> - No, I can find it.<br> - It's on the second floor.<br> - Yes. Good night, Miss Shelley.<br> I'd better stay and finish this job,<br> if you don't mind.<br> I'd rather you leave everything<br> as it is and go home. Good night.<br> - Right in there.<br> - Thank you. Good night.<br> I forgot my hat and coat.<br> Would you please close the front door<br> noiselessly when you leave?<br> Hey, where are you?<br> I was going to break your neck.<br> Lucky you spoke.<br> Yes, it certainly was.<br> All right, he's asleep now.<br> You used to live here with your mother,<br> didn't you?<br> Yes. We live in town now<br> and rent this place.<br> Come on, get up.<br> You can make it if you go quietly.<br> My ankle is so swollen now,<br> I couldn't walk five yards.<br> Why does everything happen to me?<br> What will you do?<br> You can't stay here.<br> You're still the prettiest girl<br> in Lochester.<br> Now, look. This escape was insane.<br> You haven't been convicted yet.<br> Go on back.<br> Maybe they won't convict you.<br> The first day I saw the faces<br> of those 12 citizens on the jury...<br> ...I knew my goose was cooked.<br> They don't like me.<br> What do you suppose they think<br> after this jailbreak?<br> That you're guilty.<br> It's possible I am, don't you think?<br> Maybe, maybe not.<br> As far as I know, you're capable<br> of anything, even burning a factory.<br> You were the wildest kid that ever went<br> to a Lochester school.<br> You wore pigtails then.<br> I was in love with you.<br> Always collecting a bad reputation,<br> even after you grew up.<br> Speeches on street corners, petitions.<br> Any kind of a squawk,<br> Dilg's right in the middle of it.<br> This was bound to happen.<br> What's wrong with you, anyway?<br> It's a form of self-expression.<br> Some people write books, some music.<br> I make speeches on street corners.<br> This is no time for nonsense.<br> You're even prettier now.<br> What about Yates?<br> Does he know what you've done?<br> - Yates?<br> - Sam Yates, your lawyer.<br> Don't you know your own lawyer?<br> The state gave me a lawyer.<br> If anybody can help, it's Sam.<br> I'll call him,<br> and that's the end of it for me.<br> Whatever Yates decides,<br> he's got to get you out of here by dawn.<br> - That ankle had better be better.<br> - Thank you.<br> - See that you keep quiet.<br> - Yes, Miss Shelley.<br> I thought you had gone.<br> I was hoping you'd be awake.<br> I must say, this is irregular.<br> - I'm in trouble.<br> - In trouble?<br> - Yes, it's Mother.<br> - And what has Mother to do with it?<br> We live in a house in town.<br> We scrape on each other's nerves.<br> Sometimes the fights,<br> the things we say to each other...<br> Today we had one of our disagreements.<br> You have no idea how ugly.<br> The only thing that works is absence.<br> I thought that I'd stay here tonight.<br> You weren't supposed to come<br> until tomorrow.<br> I'm sorry, forgive me.<br> I'll go now.<br> Miss Shelley.<br> If you wish, another room.<br> Thank you so much.<br> There are plenty of blankets.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Good night.<br> Good night.<br> I was wondering if I could borrow<br> a pair of your pyjamas.<br> Thank you so much.<br> - Don't mention it. Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> If you're worried about anything,<br> there's a lock just inside the door.<br> Thank you. Good night.<br> Hello, is Mr. Yates there?<br> Do you know where I can find him?<br> Nora Shelley.<br> You haven't any idea<br> when he'll be back?<br> You haven't.<br> No, he can't reach me.<br> I may call again<br> early in the morning.<br> Goodbye. Thank you.<br> She must have adenoids.<br> Oh, my gosh.<br> Hey, get back in there.<br> Good morning.<br> A morning for the angels.<br> - A morning for jailbirds to stay in.<br> - What's for breakfast?<br> Lovely, lovely.<br> Really lovely.<br> Beautifully lovely.<br> Good morning.<br> Morning.<br> - Did you sleep well?<br> - Fair, thank you.<br> That's good.<br> Your adenoids trouble you, don't they?<br> Perhaps I shouldn't mention it...<br> ...but I've never heard such<br> magnificent snoring in my life.<br> Yes, isn't it awful?<br> They're as big as your fist.<br> I'll be obliged if you patch things up<br> with your mother today.<br> I'll go right home as soon<br> as I get things straightened up.<br> I intend to be at work<br> within the half-hour.<br> Please get dressed and leave,<br> without slamming the door.<br> But, your breakfast...<br> I'll have it ready in a jiffy.<br> If you don't mind, I'd prefer to...<br> Hello, is Mr. Yates there?<br> He's left the house?<br> Where to? Do you know?<br> This is Miss Shelley again.<br> Did you tell him I phoned last night?<br> No.<br> No, thanks.<br> Mother.<br> - What is this?<br> - Don't get alarmed.<br> Why did you stay out all night?<br> Where did you get these?<br> - Why didn't you phone me?<br> - It's all very simple.<br> Who owns that car?<br> Professor Lightcap has arrived.<br> These are his pyjamas.<br> Take that look off your face.<br> I stayed to finish the house.<br> It was too late to phone you...<br> - Hi, Nora.<br> - Donald, what are you doing here?<br> - That's some getup.<br> - What do you want?<br> Came to interview Lightcap.<br> - He's not even here yet.<br> - Not expected for weeks.<br> - I'd know his pyjamas anywhere.<br> - How'd he know that?<br> Get a shot of Miss Shelley...<br> You lift that camera, I bust it.<br> Get out of here.<br> It serves you right, Nora.<br> Get dressed and come right...<br> Oh, a beard.<br> I take it all back, baby.<br> And what, may I ask, is going on here?<br> Professor, this is my mother.<br> Professor Lightcap, I'm so glad.<br> I've heard of you but<br> I was afraid you were a younger man.<br> My name is Forrester.<br> I'd like an interview.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - Your opinion in the Dilg case would...<br> - Dilg's escaped.<br> - No!<br> - Yeah.<br> What do you say about this jailbreak?<br> An admission of guilt?<br> - I'm not acquainted with the case.<br> - The burning of the Holmes factory...<br> - Mr. Lightcap wants his breakfast.<br> - And reasonable solitude.<br> Now will you please go.<br> - Will you come right home?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> - Where does it go, Miss Shelley?<br> - Right over there.<br> - Excuse me, bud.<br> - No, right over there, Eddie.<br> - You weren't expected till noon.<br> - That is becoming quite evident.<br> - Bless you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You must've been caught in the rain.<br> - I was.<br> - Your mother doesn't seem frightening.<br> - She's very changeable.<br> - Why should I be frightening?<br> - Now, Mother, he wants to do his work.<br> Get out of those pyjamas.<br> - Why, Sam Yates! Look at you.<br> - Hello, Nora.<br> I'm hiding in the middle of a parade.<br> - Why, Sam Yates.<br> - Michael. I'll be doggoned.<br> - How'd you know I wanted to see him?<br> - I didn't know you knew him.<br> I went to school with him.<br> What did you call me about then?<br> - I didn't call you.<br> - You didn't?<br> - They gave me a message...<br> - Somebody must be cuckoo.<br> - Have you been fighting?<br> - I fight three times a day.<br> At school you had a tendency toward<br> riots. I thought you'd outgrow it.<br> I hate the way this town<br> is going after Leopold Dilg.<br> Anybody who believes what Holmes says<br> about him has got to settle with me.<br> I take it you're Dilg's lawyer.<br> I am not. That is, I am.<br> The state appointed me.<br> But Dilg doesn't want me. He says an<br> innocent man doesn't need a lawyer.<br> - Original thinker.<br> - He certainly is.<br> He's the only honest man in town<br> and they want to hang him.<br> Sam, really.<br> He's been shouting for years<br> that Holmes is crooked.<br> Mind you, he's just a worker with<br> gumption enough to fight the boss.<br> Getting quite a following too.<br> So, what happens?<br> He predicts the mills will burn down.<br> They do. One man is killed.<br> Here's Holmes' chance.<br> "It was Dilg," he says.<br> He lashes this burg into a frenzy,<br> he rigs this phoney trial.<br> Dilg escapes because he knows<br> he hasn't got a chance.<br> - And the way this town feels now...<br> - What did you expect me to do?<br> You, the most distinguished legal mind<br> in the state, could head a committee...<br> ...and demand a fair trial for him,<br> away from the prejudice of this town.<br> Judge Grunstadt is a tool of Holmes<br> and out to get Dilg.<br> He's said as much.<br> You're not buying the idea.<br> My business is with<br> the principles of law.<br> I can't get mixed up<br> in these little local affairs.<br> The philosophy behind the deed,<br> that's my field.<br> - May I quote that?<br> - No.<br> Little squabbles, eh? Personality.<br> And now what?<br> - Who lives here?<br> - Michael Lightcap.<br> - Take the house, I'll take the grounds.<br> - Have you got a search warrant?<br> Dilg escaped.<br> We're searching every house.<br> Have you a warrant?<br> There's nobody here but us.<br> - Lightcap came here for a quiet summer.<br> - Listen...<br> No warrant, out!<br> That's from the Constitution.<br> - Well, not exactly in those words.<br> - Nobody's here but us.<br> And that's too many.<br> Please leave, all of you.<br> Yes, Mother, will you, please?<br> Donald. Both of you.<br> - Don't come home in those pyjamas.<br> - I won't.<br> Watch it, now. Here we come.<br> Just put that down there.<br> I've rented this house and I don't want<br> a lot of policemen in it, or truckmen.<br> - Shippers, bud.<br> - Or shippers bud, reporters, mothers.<br> Bless you.<br> You be sure to take them off now<br> and come home soon.<br> - So long, Michael.<br> - I'm sorry, Sam.<br> You're still wearing it, I see.<br> It's becoming. You've grown into it.<br> And what's that?<br> - It's the coffee boiling.<br> - Take it off.<br> You do it, will you?<br> I've got to speak to Mother.<br> Do you know who's up in that attic?<br> Leopold Dilg.<br> - Who?<br> - Dilg.<br> - In that attic?<br> - Yes.<br> - Now?<br> - Yes, now.<br> He stumbled in here last night<br> five minutes before Lightcap arrived.<br> - What's funny?<br> - "Can't get involved in local affairs."<br> - There's a local affair in his house.<br> - Get him out of here.<br> What's as safe as<br> a law professor's home?<br> Are you kidding?<br> Dilg's life won't be worth a dime<br> if I turn him back to that jury now.<br> - Lightcap can help, but it'll take time.<br> - That's nothing to me. He can't stay here.<br> - Why not?<br> - Who'd take care of him?<br> - You.<br> - Me?<br> - Miss Shelley.<br> - Yes, just a minute.<br> I can't hang around here.<br> Lightcap's ordered me out.<br> I'm here now only because I'm in his<br> pyjamas. If not, I'd be out on my ear.<br> Then stay in them.<br> - Yes, I'm coming.<br> - I'll keep in touch.<br> The coffeepot is about to explode.<br> I'm coming, Your Honour.<br> I'm coming.<br> - Would you like some coffee?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Is that the way you like your eggs?<br> - Thank you, yes.<br> By the way, if you could arrange<br> to get out of my pyjamas...<br> ...I'd take it as a great<br> personal favour.<br> Just as soon as<br> I clear things up a bit.<br> Please leave things as they are.<br> I intend to start right away.<br> What are you going to do<br> about your lunch and dinner?<br> Is there a good employment agency<br> in the town?<br> - Mrs. Hines. She's very good.<br> - Will you leave me her phone number?<br> - You want a cook, naturally.<br> - And a stenographer.<br> Would you object to both functions<br> being performed by one person?<br> Very advantageous.<br> You want it quiet,<br> no extraneous people tramping about.<br> Do I understand that you are<br> applying for this position?<br> Yes.<br> Judging by the last 12 hours...<br> ...how quiet could the house be<br> with you in it?<br> You mustn't judge by that.<br> Take right now, for instance.<br> Nice and peaceful, isn't it?<br> Excuse me, please.<br> - Michael Lightcap?<br> - Yes, indeed. Telegram for you.<br> Professor Lightcap, for you.<br> Of course, if you get telegrams,<br> it's not my fault.<br> Bad news?<br> - It's from my man, Tilney.<br> - Is he arriving?<br> Not for a few days.<br> You see, it happens to be my birthday,<br> and Tilney always remembers it.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Do I look 40 years old?<br> - Yes, you...<br> That is, in a way, you do.<br> Will you let me have<br> Mrs. Hines' number?<br> As I said, I represent<br> the perfect solution.<br> Cook and secretary.<br> $40 a week and board.<br> - I dictate 150 words a minute.<br> - Some think more slowly than others.<br> - Breakfast at 8, eggs every other day.<br> - No eggs tomorrow.<br> Lunch at 1, an hour for correspondence,<br> work from 3 to 6, dinner at 7.<br> How could you find time<br> for all of that?<br> I could cook while you're reading,<br> you see?<br> - I think someone more mature...<br> - Let me try. I'd love to work for you.<br> It'd be a mental holiday for me. You<br> only need a cook until your man arrives.<br> It'd be a shame<br> to hire a woman temporarily.<br> It doesn't matter to me. I'm a<br> teacher and this is my summer vacation.<br> Don't you agree with me?<br> You'll never regret this move.<br> Your clothes, Miss Shelley.<br> We got them here as quick as we could.<br> Take them right upstairs.<br> First door to the right.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I'll get out of these pyjamas.<br> Collect your thoughts.<br> When I come down,<br> you can plunge right into work.<br> The beginning is always<br> a little difficult.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Jot down this title:<br> The Relation of Literature to<br> Legislation in 18th-Century England.<br> Yes, sir.<br> The effects...<br> There's no need to say "Yes, sir."<br> No, sir.<br> The effects of literature<br> upon legislation...<br> ...is a study that has long claimed<br> the interests of scientists...<br> ...social scientists...<br> ...in every country in the world.<br> The law is the sum of the experience<br> of civilized man...<br> ...the sign that man<br> has emerged from the jungle.<br> Period.<br> The 18th century was the high point<br> of man's intellectual development.<br> Reason, simple and pure...<br> ...was the weight against which<br> human problems were held in balance.<br> Law became, for the first time...<br> ...the instrument of pure logic...<br> ...with each man's rights<br> and responsibilities...<br> ...considered from the viewpoint<br> of the possible and reasonable...<br> ...rather than the...<br> Bless you.<br> Thank you.<br> Pay close attention.<br> Did you get that?<br> "...from the viewpoint of the possible<br> and reasonable rather than..."<br> - rather than the feudal conventions<br> of divine and everlasting rights.<br> It was the aim of the lawmakers<br> and the law administrators...<br> ...to build the law firmly<br> on principles...<br> ...which are above small emotions,<br> greed...<br> ...and the loose thinking<br> of everyday life.<br> Impossible.<br> The law is a gun<br> pointed at somebody's head.<br> It all depends upon which<br> end of the gun you stand.<br> Who is he?<br> He's the gardener, Joseph.<br> Joseph, this is Professor Lightcap,<br> the new tenant.<br> Pleased to know you.<br> Excuse me, I...<br> Still, your point of view<br> is very interesting.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It represents the ideal condition.<br> I like people who think in terms<br> of ideal conditions.<br> They're the dreamers, poets, tragic<br> figures in this world, but interesting.<br> - How are the zinnias getting along?<br> - Dying.<br> - You see, professor...<br> - I must get on with my dictation.<br> You might see if you<br> can save the zinnias.<br> Certainly. Still, it might do you good<br> to talk to somebody like me.<br> I have certain very practical<br> relations with the law.<br> The zinnias, Joseph.<br> Miss Shelley, we might as well take<br> our work inside. It's getting chilly.<br> Bless you.<br> If you'll excuse us, Joseph.<br> And now, what's that?<br> - What are you trying to do?<br> - When I hear nonsense, I get an impulse.<br> - Get upstairs.<br> - With this ankle, it's too late.<br> Then hide somewhere, quick.<br> Get in there.<br> See who it is, will you?<br> I'm looking for Michael Lightcap.<br> I was told he arrived yesterday.<br> Yes, indeed. Come right in.<br> - Well, well, Senator Boyd.<br> - How are you? I'm glad to see you.<br> - This is quite a surprise. Sit down.<br> - No, thanks, I'll only be a minute.<br> I have a bit of news for you.<br> - Rather important.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Senator, my secretary.<br> - And cook.<br> - And cook?<br> - How do you do, senator?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Now, sit down.<br> The news I have for you couldn't<br> be entrusted to the mail or telegraph.<br> By the way, what party<br> do you belong to?<br> - I vote whichever way I see fit.<br> - An independent voter.<br> The backbone of the country.<br> Senator Boyd, please,<br> won't you tell me what...<br> Well, Lightcap...<br> ...the president would be<br> pleased to appoint you...<br> ...to the bench of the<br> Supreme Court in September.<br> Well? Would you be willing to accept?<br> - I'd be willing to accept.<br> - Wonderful. Perfect.<br> Congratulations. In six weeks, your<br> name will be submitted to the Senate.<br> The Senate will investigate, naturally,<br> but I don't think we have to fear that.<br> But I'd be careful.<br> I'd keep the name out of the papers<br> if I were you.<br> I've been keeping my name<br> out of the papers for years.<br> - I've got to start back.<br> - You must have something first.<br> No, thanks, really.<br> - Goodbye, Michael. Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You'll hear from me.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Miss Shelley, yes...<br> Where were we?<br> Oh, yes, bring your book.<br> You're not going back to work now.<br> - Bring your book.<br> - But you've done a good morning's work.<br> Besides, this is your birthday.<br> And really, professor, you've<br> got a honey of a cold.<br> I feel responsible for it.<br> I'm going to take care of you.<br> I'm going to put you to bed and feed<br> you nourishing broths and hot lemonade.<br> - Hot lemonade?<br> - Yes.<br> Now, now, don't be silly.<br> Bring your book.<br> There's something to what she says.<br> Take care of your health.<br> - Supreme Court. What do you know?<br> - This stuff he reads is remarkably dead.<br> - You eating again?<br> - That prison food was terrible.<br> Supreme Court appointment<br> or not, we're dragging him into this.<br> Yeah, we certainly must.<br> We must, must we?<br> Look at him. Calm and relaxed<br> like he was on his yacht.<br> He got his neck in a noose<br> and now he says, "We certainly must."<br> How do you suggest we start, Leopold?<br> Well, what have we here?<br> An intelligent man, but cold.<br> No blood in his thinking.<br> So we must start to thaw him out.<br> We thaw him.<br> Can't let a man like that take a seat<br> on the highest court in our land.<br> I see. All of a sudden what<br> he's concerned about is our country.<br> Our country first, yes.<br> Then my neck next.<br> That's beautiful, but this thawing-out<br> process... We haven't got months.<br> Plenty of time. I like to break out in<br> a sweat every time the doorbell rings.<br> How do you propose we thaw him,<br> Leopold, with a blowtorch?<br> Well, we have to give<br> that some thought.<br> We have a good start.<br> - The prettiest woman in Lochester.<br> - Miss Shelley.<br> Miss Shelley.<br> I'm feeling a little tired.<br> I think I'll get some sleep.<br> That's just what you need,<br> plenty of rest.<br> Yes, it's been quite a day.<br> This is for you, for being<br> such a good patient.<br> Thank you, Miss Shelley.<br> The professor's custard.<br> Not now, Joseph. Thank you.<br> Not at all. I was on my way<br> to bed anyway.<br> - Feeling better, professor?<br> - Much better.<br> - I'm really very grateful to you both.<br> - Say nothing of it.<br> Your cold will thaw. Everything thaws.<br> Good night, Joseph.<br> I hope your ankle is better.<br> Thank you.<br> Good night, Miss Shelley.<br> Good night.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Well, what's wrong?<br> - Well...<br> - I didn't think you'd be down.<br> - No, stay as you are.<br> - The gardener shouldn't eat here.<br> - Nonsense. Sit, I insist.<br> - Good morning.<br> - You sure you should be up?<br> - Yes, I'm quite well.<br> - That's good.<br> - Is there a morning paper?<br> - I'll see.<br> No, it hasn't come yet.<br> Wonderful cook. We're in clover.<br> I'll take this out of your way.<br> Well, Joseph, this is very nice<br> and companionable.<br> You know, there's a touch of<br> the philosopher about you that I like.<br> - And you interest me enormously.<br> - Good. Good.<br> - Sit down and have some breakfast.<br> - Yes, I just must get the coffee.<br> Wonderful.<br> - Ever had borscht, professor?<br> - What's that?<br> Beet soup with sour cream.<br> It's a Polish dish.<br> With an egg in it. Don't let anybody<br> give it to you without an egg in it.<br> - We must have some, Miss Shelley.<br> - Of course.<br> As soon as I finish my course<br> in American cooking...<br> You can buy it<br> at Mrs. Pulaski's Polish dairy.<br> Pulaski's. By all means,<br> let's get some.<br> Well, here we are, professor.<br> No!<br> This is not your egg morning.<br> Well, you certainly think<br> of everything, Miss Shelley.<br> Too bad about your paper. Still, if you<br> read yesterday's, why read today's?<br> - Just some more about that man Dilg.<br> - Dilg?<br> - Oh, the fugitive from justice.<br> - Or a miscarriage of justice.<br> - Your opinion too?<br> - It'd be yours if you knew Mr. Holmes.<br> He puts a fellow like Grunstadt<br> on the bench. Grunstadt takes orders.<br> - Well, the voters may remove him.<br> - This corruption is too thick.<br> That's the way every decent<br> person around here feels about it.<br> If feelings influenced law, half the<br> country would be in jail. Facts.<br> My dear professor, people wind facts<br> around each other like pretzels.<br> Facts alone, that's a nut<br> without a kernel.<br> Where's the soul? The instinct?<br> Where's the warm, human side?<br> Conduct the law on sentimentality and<br> you will have violence and disorder.<br> Your way, you have a Greek statue.<br> Beautiful, but dead.<br> All right, two schools of thought.<br> I see your point of view, theoretically.<br> In fact, I respect it.<br> I wish I could<br> respect yours, professor.<br> Joseph puts it a little strongly.<br> He does respect you.<br> He's for the practical side, the<br> garden-variety type of human experience.<br> - Yes, and makes the law up as he goes.<br> - Out of common sense, yes.<br> The way I see it, you don't live in this<br> country, you just take up room in it.<br> - Now, Joseph.<br> - That's all right.<br> - Discussion amongst friends.<br> - Delightful.<br> All you know about the American scene<br> is what you read in magazines.<br> Somebody else's impressions<br> hashed up for lazy people.<br> If you don't feel it yourself,<br> you've learned nothing.<br> - Miss Shelley, I am at a total loss.<br> - That'll do, Joseph, for this morning.<br> Professor, I challenge you<br> to make an experiment.<br> Spend half a day with books and the<br> other half finding out what people do.<br> With these indoor habits of yours,<br> you've got the complexion of gravel.<br> - You're no oil painting yourself.<br> - A mummy's closer. They wore beards.<br> Well, Joseph, what would you suggest?<br> Well, there's a baseball game today.<br> Baseball? Baseball!<br> Joseph, are you crazy?<br> Baseball? Lightcap?<br> If I know the habits<br> of our leading Lochester citizens...<br> ...Professor Lightcap is about to have<br> an enlightening experience.<br> Pass the beans.<br> - Peanuts, peanuts.<br> - Come on, Dockwoilor. Pickle it!<br> - Hi, judge.<br> - Hi.<br> Hello, judge.<br> Get your fresh-roasted<br> Georgia goobers, 10 cents a bag.<br> - Hello, Your Honour.<br> - How do you do, sir?<br> - Hello, Miss Shelley.<br> - Hello, judge.<br> - Anything happen?<br> - Connolly speared a line drive, a beaut.<br> Professor Lightcap,<br> this is Judge Grunstadt.<br> - Lightcap. Why, how do you do, sir?<br> - How do you...?<br> - Well, this is a great honour.<br> - Thank you. Did you say Judge...?<br> Grunstadt. Doubt you've heard<br> of me. But your work...<br> I've read it in the Law Review.<br> Admired it deeply. Who hasn't?<br> It's profound. Yes, austere.<br> Absolutely austere.<br> Sit down, you're not made of glass.<br> Yes, indeed. How I envy you, sir.<br> You work in the quiet of your library<br> and the world does not interrupt.<br> That was right across the plate!<br> But me, I labour in the vineyard.<br> You've heard of the Dilg case?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - There's luck for you.<br> First case I've had in 10 years<br> that drew any outside attention.<br> Slide, you idiot, slide!<br> And right in the middle of the trial,<br> the swine skips out.<br> - I was preparing a brilliant opinion.<br> - Before the trail was finished?<br> - They hadn't brought all the evidence in.<br> - But he was as guilty as Judas.<br> - How do you know?<br> - The clearest thing.<br> The town malcontent.<br> Holy terror, even as a boy.<br> Throw it, throw it, you blockhead!<br> You consider it ethical to judge a man<br> without all the evidence?<br> My dear fellow, he broke jail.<br> That proves it, doesn't it?<br> Even a library philosopher<br> like you would have to admit that.<br> Miss Shelley, I think we've had<br> enough baseball for today.<br> - You're not going.<br> - I have work to do.<br> That's too bad.<br> Great thing, this baseball. Gets the<br> legal cobwebs out of the brain.<br> I have this box. Any time<br> you'd like to see a game...<br> - Thank you.<br> - Sit down, will you?<br> You play very well.<br> Where did you learn?<br> My father. He was the kind<br> of man who resented work.<br> It interfered with<br> chess, and argument.<br> You're a man of many parts.<br> I look forward to a very<br> pleasant summer.<br> - Thank you. Your king is still in check.<br> - Yes, now, let's see.<br> Thanks for lending me these slippers.<br> It's been a relief.<br> Well, that's good. I'm glad.<br> - Cosy here, isn't it, Miss Shelley?<br> - I'm glad you're comfortable, Joseph.<br> - Did you hear that fool Grunstadt?<br> - Yes, wasn't it remarkable?<br> Joseph, Judge Grunstadt was sitting<br> next to us at the game today.<br> - I hear he's a very charming man.<br> - He's an idiot.<br> Writing an opinion of a case<br> before hearing the evidence...<br> Preposterous fake.<br> - Your rules don't allow that.<br> - Naturally not.<br> And what do you do about it?<br> - I?<br> - You or anybody.<br> There's nothing to do.<br> I can't intrude on the business<br> of the Superior Court of the county.<br> So you just turn your face.<br> Joseph, you don't understand.<br> I understand you laugh at my<br> kind of law and wink at the other.<br> What kind do you practice?<br> I refuse to be dragged into any further<br> discussion of the philosophy of law.<br> Well, then let's not.<br> Joseph, I'm sorry.<br> It isn't that I have no respect<br> for your intelligence.<br> - But you're taking a vacation from law.<br> - Exactly. But I was a little sharp.<br> - Don't mention it.<br> - Now, let's see. My king is in check.<br> As a matter of fact, Joseph, I'm very<br> grateful for your presence in the house.<br> And you're a big treat<br> to me, professor.<br> Thank you, Joseph.<br> They've picked up Dilg's scent.<br> They'll let us know when they<br> get him cornered. They never miss.<br> You wouldn't believe it, Sam,<br> the way those two like each other.<br> - Maybe the thaw is actually setting in.<br> - Maybe.<br> That professor's got a mind<br> like a steel trap.<br> And sometimes he seems like such<br> a little boy, I feel like kissing him.<br> - Not a bad idea.<br> - Never do that.<br> - What are you doing out?<br> - An active man has to stretch his legs.<br> Naturally you feel like kissing him.<br> He's a wonderful man.<br> - I only meant that I...<br> - Of course.<br> And the way he looks at you... When<br> a thaw sets in, anything can happen.<br> Leopold, stop acting like a fool.<br> His man Tilney may arrive any minute.<br> There's plenty of time.<br> Holmes is whipping up such hysteria,<br> they'll go over this whole country.<br> Tomorrow he's pulling a big affair<br> at the factory ruins.<br> - Well, that's fine.<br> - What do you mean?<br> A most important experience<br> for our professor.<br> I'm getting awfully... How do you think<br> I'm going to get him down there?<br> There are some old buildings<br> down there.<br> Some of the best examples of early<br> American architecture in New England.<br> And he's a cultured man from Boston.<br> Should be simple.<br> Get back in the attic.<br> Joseph!<br> Help!<br> We're getting close, sheriff.<br> - We got him, sheriff.<br> - Dilg, come down.<br> - Them hounds never miss.<br> - I'll shoot you.<br> Don't shoot!<br> Don't shoot. Don't shoot, boys.<br> Take off that beard, Dilg.<br> I recognize you.<br> His name is Professor Lightcap.<br> I'm sorry, professor, but I've never<br> known hounds to make a mistake.<br> - This town is nothing but mistakes.<br> - Bad dogs.<br> And I'll thank you to call<br> your men off and your dogs too.<br> I'll see that you lose<br> your badge for this.<br> I can't understand it.<br> I raised those hounds and this is the<br> first time they've ever made a mistake.<br> - That house there was built in 1740.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> Beaver.<br> It's a game. First one to spot a beard.<br> Beards are unusual in these parts.<br> I suppose they are. I don't think I<br> ever told anyone how I came to grow it.<br> I was one of the youngest ever<br> to graduate from Harvard Law School.<br> In fact, I was teaching at<br> Commonwealth before I was 22.<br> I had a frank and open face. People<br> in trolley cars used to call me "sonny."<br> Boys I was teaching would slap me<br> on the back. Women would wink at me.<br> - Is that bad?<br> - No, but I had no time for nonsense.<br> The beard became a sort of fortress.<br> And then I grew attached to it.<br> - I think it's pretty.<br> - What am I to say to that?<br> - I wonder what's going on over here.<br> - Pulaski's, the borscht place.<br> - We must get some for Joseph.<br> - We haven't time.<br> But think of his face, the ecstasy.<br> - You're going to spoil that man.<br> - Spoil Joseph?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Borscht, please.<br> - A quart.<br> - Yes.<br> With an egg in it.<br> - It must have an egg beaten up in it.<br> - Yes, sir. In a moment, sir.<br> Ma, come on.<br> - Look. Look at those two.<br> - I see them. So?<br> - They ordered a quart of borscht.<br> - So?<br> - With an egg!<br> - Is that a crime?<br> Only one customer ever<br> orders it that way:<br> Leopold Dilg!<br> Sherlock Holmes, you think that<br> he's Leopold Dilg with a beard, huh?<br> - I'm going to follow them.<br> - My own Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br> I'm an American citizen. In America,<br> everybody is responsible for everything.<br> - I'm following.<br> - He's such a...<br> With an egg. It's wonderful.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - This is the way back to the car.<br> - But this is the shortest way.<br> Well, well, as I live and breathe,<br> Michael Lightcap.<br> - Hello, Nora.<br> - Hello.<br> - What's cooking over there, Sam?<br> - Holmes is having pictures taken...<br> ...to remind people Dilg is a villain.<br> - I think our car is this way.<br> - You mustn't miss this. See that pose?<br> That's how you try a case out<br> of court and stack the evidence.<br> Right there, Mr. Holmes. Hold it.<br> That's good, thank you.<br> - See how it's done.<br> - No, I have an appointment.<br> Mr. Lightcap, for goodness' sakes.<br> I'm very glad to see you again, sir.<br> - I want you to meet Mr. Holmes.<br> - I must be going...<br> - Mr. Holmes.<br> - Give Mr. Holmes room.<br> Mr. Holmes, meet<br> Professor Michael Lightcap.<br> I'm glad to see you. I don't wonder<br> this tragedy attracted even you.<br> - As a matter of fact...<br> - Public feeling has run high.<br> As for Mr. Dilg, justice<br> will not be cheated.<br> - I'm sure it won't.<br> - Miss Bush.<br> Here's an example of how deeply this<br> tragedy has struck.<br> Miss Bush, a friend of Clyde<br> Bracken, the man who was killed.<br> I'm pleased to meet you.<br> - We found her searching the ashes.<br> - I was looking for a watch I gave Clyde.<br> All they found of Bracken<br> was a medal he had won in school.<br> It gives a girl a queer feeling.<br> A man weighs 211 lbs. And, wham, all<br> that's left is a medal for shot-putting.<br> Too bad they're not taking a picture<br> of Dilg swinging from a pole.<br> - Who said that?<br> - I did.<br> Jake, I told you anybody<br> talking like that had to fight me.<br> I've licked you four times in two weeks.<br> I'm tired of hitting you.<br> - Go on, put them up.<br> - Sam Yates, you're a disgrace.<br> - Save that wind for the bench, judge.<br> - Jake, now, come on.<br> - Break it up.<br> - Let him go.<br> Hit him!<br> - Go on, break it up.<br> - Why don't you guys act like men...<br> ...instead of a couple of kids?<br> Miss Shelley?<br> - I looked all over for you.<br> - I won't have it, Miss Shelley.<br> Yates deliberately<br> dragged me into this.<br> - His motives aren't selfish.<br> - That has nothing to do with it.<br> I know, but you take a man like<br> Holmes whipping people into hysteria...<br> ...it makes you wonder.<br> - Not me, I cannot be involved.<br> - If it's your purpose to see that I...<br> - Professor, this amounts to violence.<br> And from you? Making charges against<br> Miss Shelley without evidence?<br> - Perhaps I'd better resign, professor.<br> - No, Miss Shelley...<br> You're right, Joseph.<br> I apologize, Miss Shelley.<br> Now, you see, a happy family again.<br> And the question is, are<br> we ready for dinner?<br> - Are we ready for dinner?<br> - I'll be right down.<br> - Any time you're ready, Joseph.<br> - One minute!<br> - I'm very sorry I lost my temper.<br> - That's all right. You're forgiven.<br> I've been thinking of something.<br> I may be going to Washington.<br> I can't tell you in what capacity.<br> Not just yet.<br> But I'll need someone there with me,<br> more than a secretary.<br> Someone I can trust and respect.<br> It would be an important job, for life.<br> It would mean your giving up<br> your career in Lochester...<br> ...so I can't urge you to take it,<br> but I sincerely wish you would.<br> - Well, I don't know what to say.<br> - I realize...<br> But all I'm asking now<br> is that you will consider it.<br> - Yes, I will, thank you.<br> - That's wonderful.<br> - Here we are.<br> - All ready?<br> - Come on, Miss Shelley.<br> - That's good.<br> My dear professor.<br> - Did you make these, Joseph?<br> - Not bad, eh?<br> - Why the soup plates? There's no soup.<br> - No soup, eh? No soup.<br> Joseph, while strolling in town...<br> No, that's a bad beginning.<br> My dear Joseph, to cement the bond<br> that binds our happy family together...<br> ...what could<br> be more fitting than...<br> Borscht! It's that rubber band.<br> Pulaski's, I'd know it anywhere.<br> - Wait a minute. I won't get a taste.<br> - Fancy you thinking of that.<br> With an egg in it.<br> - You scared me, professor.<br> - Is that the kind your mother made?<br> - What?<br> - Is that the kind your mother made?<br> - Yeah, almost. Here we go.<br> - Use the cup.<br> I'm an old hand at this, don't worry.<br> Nectar, Miss Shelley. Nectar.<br> Don't spill it.<br> Give me lots, I love it.<br> What are you going to do?<br> - Call the police.<br> - No, no you won't do that.<br> Professor...<br> ...I'm sorry I spoiled your party.<br> There's no use discussing my case.<br> I'm afraid not, Joseph... Leopold.<br> I have a duty to perform<br> and I must do it.<br> When he hid in that attic,<br> he didn't know who you were.<br> Nora.<br> Here we have the two<br> schools of thought, professor.<br> This time in action.<br> That telephone to you means<br> law and order. And to me...<br> ...I've got to stop you using that<br> telephone. By violence, if necessary.<br> Yes, I see. That's bad.<br> I have a very warm feeling for you,<br> but I must use this telephone.<br> If you do, professor,<br> and I am as fond of you as a brother...<br> ...I'll be compelled to knock you down.<br> No!<br> Please, professor, let's be sensible.<br> I should regret that too. I've never<br> been fonder of a man in my life, but...<br> Operator?<br> Give me the police station.<br> - Hello, is that the police?<br> - No, please!<br> - Oh, Leopold.<br> - Nora, I'm sorry, but...<br> Cover the house.<br> He's up there. Come on.<br> Take that room, sergeant.<br> Take the other room, Ed.<br> Does Mr. Lightcap live here?<br> Mr. Lightcap?<br> Mr. Lightcap!<br> Speak to me, sir.<br> Pardon me, sir, are you the doctor?<br> Yeah. See that he gets rest and quiet.<br> - Why, Tilney.<br> - Are you all right?<br> You. You knew it was Dilg.<br> All those lies, attentions,<br> just for Dilg.<br> You and Sam Yates.<br> - You planned it all, didn't you?<br> - Mr. Lightcap, take it easy, sir.<br> You're a silly, dangerous girl.<br> You had me feed and lodge<br> a notorious fugitive from justice.<br> You endangered a lifetime's<br> career for a stupid gesture.<br> - Michael, let me tell you...<br> - Our association is at an end, Nora.<br> That's a tip-off.<br> You had to get good and sore<br> before calling me by my first name.<br> - Miss Shelley.<br> - "Nora" when you're angry, remember?<br> - That will be all, Miss Shelley.<br> - That will not be all.<br> Dilg is innocent, regardless of<br> all the reasonable evidence...<br> ...dredged up by lawyers.<br> I'd rather be hated<br> by 40 frozen legal giants like you...<br> ...than turn him over to those<br> bloodthirsty idiots of Lochester.<br> You were right to grow a beard.<br> You were an old man all your life.<br> Don't ever shave it off, Mr. Twilight,<br> somebody might think you were alive.<br> Come on, Sam, let's get out of here.<br> When did you hide Dilg in that house?<br> - I didn't hide anybody.<br> - Oh, you didn't?<br> - When did you first know he was there?<br> - Last night, just before you did.<br> Showed up in the kitchen, hungry.<br> Care much for borscht, Miss Shelley?<br> Do you care much for borscht?<br> That's funny. I bought some<br> yesterday at Pulaski's.<br> With an egg, perchance?<br> Why, yes!<br> The professor said, "With an egg."<br> - The professor was with you?<br> - Pulaski didn't leave that out, did he?<br> - The professor wanted it with an egg?<br> - With an egg.<br> Dilg has been buying it there<br> for years with an egg!<br> Are you trying to tell me the professor<br> bought that borscht for Dilg?<br> I'm telling you he didn't know who<br> he was buying it for. But you did.<br> That's quite a statement.<br> What kind of statement<br> would you care to make?<br> I'd say that two men liking borscht<br> with an egg in it, is amazing.<br> I've never heard<br> of such a thing before.<br> If any scandal attaches to Lightcap's<br> name out of this incident...<br> Just a few questions<br> we must have answers to.<br> Senator, these questions have nothing<br> to do with Professor Lightcap.<br> But they bear strongly<br> on a lady named Nora Shelley.<br> Yes, well, go on, Mr. Scott.<br> Get it over with.<br> How did the assault take place?<br> I was going to the telephone to call<br> the police, and he hit me from behind.<br> How did you recognize Dilg?<br> From a newspaper picture.<br> - At that very moment I was unwrapping...<br> - Borscht?<br> Yes, yes, I never can pronounce it.<br> You had never seen<br> Dilg before last night?<br> He said so, didn't he? I won't tolerate<br> that tone toward Dean Lightcap.<br> You'll end by dragging him into this.<br> Tilney, pack Mr. Lightcap's things.<br> Tilney, leave things as they are.<br> I came to write a book and I will do it.<br> They have every right<br> to ask me questions.<br> Dilg was found on the premises.<br> Now, Mr. Scott, go on.<br> How did you happen to go to<br> Mrs. Pulaski's for the borscht?<br> Miss Shelley and I were strolling by.<br> I suggested buying some.<br> Do you mean to say that you went in<br> to get borscht for yourself?<br> Yes, I love it.<br> I have loved it for years...<br> ...especially with an egg in it.<br> He loves it.<br> Okay.<br> That's all.<br> - Hello!<br> - What did you have to say?<br> I know you're anxious to go,<br> so I'll be brief.<br> I was held for questioning, I was<br> questioned, and they just said...<br> ..."Miss Shelley, you are free to go."<br> I don't know why.<br> Your daughter goes off one night<br> to the country house...<br> ...and then you find her<br> in the police station.<br> - They haven't found him yet, Sam?<br> - Not up to 15 minutes ago.<br> It's a miracle that lunatic<br> didn't kill you.<br> It's a morning of miracles.<br> They wouldn't have let me go if Lightcap<br> hadn't lied. I can't believe he did.<br> You go on, Mother, I'll go with Sam.<br> No. You need sleep and so do I.<br> I can't have you gallivanting around.<br> Phone me if anything happens.<br> Tilney, what are you doing?<br> We never have flowers, sir.<br> - The odour is distracting.<br> - I know, but just for a change...<br> After all, it's spring in the country.<br> Just leave them where they are.<br> Yes, sir, Mr. Lightcap.<br> - Tilney.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Why does a man lie?<br> Well, sir, he just<br> comes by it naturally.<br> The best of men, in self-protection,<br> or to carry out a desire of their heart...<br> But to lie against your principles<br> that took your whole life to build...<br> - Maybe we'd better go back to Boston.<br> - No.<br> I came down here to write...<br> ...but I can't write.<br> I don't understand it.<br> Tilney, where's my hat?<br> Hello, Sam.<br> Hi, Mike. What can I do for you?<br> You can stop being critical of me,<br> both you and Miss Shelley. It's unfair.<br> Well, we'll try to stop.<br> Dilg's escape is lawlessness and riot.<br> I can't get into this. I can't even<br> afford to have an opinion about it.<br> And yet there are things<br> whirling around in my brain.<br> There's Grunstadt and Holmes,<br> Miss Bush, shot-put medals.<br> You ought to be able to<br> uncover some shred of evidence.<br> - Have you gone over everything?<br> - Day and night for a month.<br> Total profit to date is the<br> fire inspector's report six weeks ago.<br> At the end of the page,<br> in Bracken's own handwriting...<br> ...he was the one killed...<br> ...says, "Sprinkler system<br> slightly defective."<br> So was the whole joint. Worn out,<br> ready to go up in smoke...<br> ...or deliberately burned by Holmes and<br> Bracken for insurance.<br> You know, this Bracken's<br> handwriting is moronic.<br> And Miss Bush's affection for him,<br> that's not sincere.<br> - I think she's putting on an act.<br> - She and Holmes are thick as fleas.<br> Quite possibly there are things<br> going on behind the scenes.<br> Quite possibly justice<br> is being hoodwinked, Sam.<br> You don't say.<br> Yet, if Dilg walked in right now...<br> Yes, I would. I'd have to.<br> I'd turn him in.<br> - Now, goodbye, Mr. Yates.<br> - Bye, Michael.<br> Mr. Lightcap.<br> Hello, Tilney.<br> No, sir. You can't do that. You can't.<br> There's work to do. It's in my way.<br> Oh, no. For 15 years, sir...<br> You have beautiful hands.<br> Scholarly.<br> Clyde had hands you could use<br> to knock in spikes with.<br> Who is Clyde?<br> "Who was Clyde?"<br> Would be more accurate.<br> I'm in mourning. It's a great hardship<br> because I like to get around.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You visiting for the summer?<br> Yes.<br> I wish he wasn't dead,<br> at least for one night.<br> I'd love to go dancing tonight.<br> Miss Bush, I wonder if<br> I might have the pleasure...<br> ...of taking you dancing tonight?<br> The pleasure?<br> Well, say now,<br> that's really something.<br> It takes my breath away.<br> Why, you're real cute.<br> Listen, you blow your horn at 7<br> tonight right outside, sonny.<br> Will you stop walking around<br> and lie down for a while?<br> I can't figure it out.<br> Why can't 100 policemen<br> find one man with a bad ankle?<br> What the dickens is that to you?<br> Nothing. It's just killing me,<br> that's all.<br> - Tilney.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I have a great regard<br> for your judgment.<br> In practical matters, I consider it<br> equal, if not superior, to my own.<br> Thank you, sir. But you worry me.<br> If you wanted to get some information<br> out of a woman, how would you do it?<br> I feared as much.<br> Now come on, help me.<br> Well, Mr. Lightcap, I've lived<br> a cloistered life, like you.<br> In fact, with you.<br> On a subject of that sort, why, we're<br> babes in the woods, both of us.<br> - But you were married once.<br> - That was the folly of youth, sir.<br> But you wooed and won her. How?<br> By the darndest series of lies<br> you ever heard.<br> I gave her a character and charms<br> she never possessed.<br> I played to the well-known weakness<br> of every woman alive...<br> ...and perjured my soul<br> for a thousand years to come.<br> Very interesting.<br> - Maybe we'd better go back to Boston.<br> - No, no, Tilney. Hurry along.<br> - We must keep our appointment.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Why, of course. I should've known.<br> What a dope.<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> If you're not out of the doorway by the<br> time I'm dressed, I'll mow you down.<br> You dance divinely, Miss Bush.<br> Your physical coordinations<br> are remarkable.<br> I thought I'd heard them all,<br> but your line is brand new.<br> You are definitely a superior person.<br> - Far too superior for this exhibition.<br> - You're cute.<br> If I was free,<br> I would take you seriously.<br> But you are free, aren't you?<br> Your gentlemen friend<br> is dead, isn't he?<br> That's the general impression.<br> What do you mean?<br> Little Regina is drinking too much.<br> It makes the tongue loose.<br> Dance, honey?<br> Your hands are beautiful.<br> Extraordinarily beautiful.<br> Would you like to kiss me?<br> Cultured. It's a cultured kiss.<br> You know, you are rare, Regina.<br> Your beauty makes my head swim.<br> Like music. Like music from a band.<br> - If I were only free...<br> - But you are free.<br> - You're only tormenting me.<br> - I'm not. I got a letter from him.<br> He wants me to meet him in Boston.<br> The moment I saw you, you seemed to<br> strike a rich, deep note inside of me.<br> Like an organ.<br> More.<br> All women after this<br> will seem different.<br> That moronic handwriting again.<br> "C. Barnard, Boston."<br> So that's where he is.<br> That's where who is?<br> Give that back.<br> - I feel like dancing.<br> - You heard me!<br> - But I hate...<br> - Give that back!<br> - Regina, darling.<br> - Don't "Regina, darling" me.<br> There's something fishy about you.<br> Help! Throw this guy out!<br> You dirty double-crosser.<br> Get him out of here!<br> Leopold.<br> Leopold.<br> Hello, Nora.<br> Leopold.<br> You idiot. I figured the attic's<br> just where you'd go.<br> Your ankle.<br> You couldn't go anyplace else.<br> Now, now. Nora Shelley, crying?<br> I've been out of my mind for 24 hours.<br> I thought you were dead.<br> Well, what an idea.<br> You know something?<br> Our friend, the professor,<br> lied to the police.<br> I knew it.<br> He did something else tonight:<br> Shaved off his beard.<br> But why?<br> Who can tell what a man<br> in love will do?<br> - In love? Who with?<br> - You.<br> And I know just how he feels.<br> The prettiest girl in Lochester.<br> Leopold, I've been<br> so miserable to you.<br> I never really knew you.<br> Leopold.<br> Stop saying "Leopold" like that,<br> tenderly.<br> It sounds funny with<br> a name like "Leopold."<br> Shut up.<br> Where's this going to end, anyway?<br> Here you are, back in the attic.<br> Now he's pulling tricks.<br> Where did he go without his beard?<br> - He'll be all right.<br> - He won't be all right. He's a child.<br> I know just how you feel.<br> Don't start that soupy stuff again.<br> You don't know<br> how I feel about anything.<br> Nora, you'd like that job<br> in Washington, wouldn't you?<br> Come on, tell me.<br> Who wouldn't want to<br> get out of this burg?<br> Certainly, and with him.<br> I've been sitting here wondering.<br> It's all wrong.<br> The whole thing's wrong.<br> What's all wrong?<br> Well, I've been wondering.<br> Suppose you two had met up here<br> and Leopold Dilg hadn't butted in.<br> - Now wait a minute.<br> - No. That isn't the whole thing.<br> That's quite a man, an important man.<br> And quite a career too.<br> Can't kick a career like that around.<br> Who said I was right about the law?<br> Leopold, what do you mean?<br> Nothing. I was just wondering,<br> that's all, Nora.<br> - What are you wondering about?<br> - Just wondering. Can't a man wonder?<br> - Nora, you'd better get going.<br> - Wait.<br> - You're taking chances.<br> - I'm going to get Yates.<br> - You stay here.<br> - Everything's going to be fine.<br> Remember what I said.<br> Don't go any place.<br> - Hurry, Tilney.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Miss Shelley, I believe Clyde Bracken<br> is still alive. It seems that...<br> - If you find my face unpleasant...<br> - No.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I came to...<br> - Did you say "Bracken"?<br> - Yes. Alive.<br> - At last you know the truth.<br> - Not until I can prove it.<br> A stickler to the last.<br> - If you knew where he was...<br> - I would turn him in.<br> You just took that beard off your face.<br> Inside, you're as whiskered<br> as the Smith Brothers.<br> - Suppose you turn me in right now.<br> - Leopold!<br> That's too bad.<br> - It was a delightful beard.<br> - Leopold.<br> - What do you say?<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> I'm leaving for Boston<br> to find Bracken.<br> How about dropping you off<br> at the police station?<br> - Do you hear? Bracken's alive.<br> - Interesting.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Tilney, I'm very hungry.<br> Could you find something<br> I can nibble on as I ride?<br> That's all right, Tilney.<br> A whole chicken.<br> He has an enormous appetite.<br> Will somebody listen to me?<br> Bracken's alive.<br> Why should Dilg go to jail?<br> It's the principal.<br> The law says that's where I should be.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Now it's you. Before it was him.<br> Will somebody please light around here?<br> My dear, centuries of precedent<br> say the professor is right.<br> Friends should be in agreement.<br> - Thank you.<br> - That'll be all tonight, Tilney.<br> If they get him in jail, they'll<br> make pt de foie gras out of him.<br> That's a bridge we can cross<br> when we come to it.<br> - Right.<br> - Who knows who's right?<br> Why does he make all the concessions?<br> Isn't there a concession in your bones?<br> Concessions?<br> I shaved off a beard I was fond of.<br> I lied to the law. I danced with a<br> blond beauty parlour owner.<br> I kissed her in public. Concessions!<br> Whenever you're ready, Leopold.<br> - Quite ready, my friend.<br> - Thank you, Leopold.<br> Don't mention it, professor.<br> - After you, professor.<br> - Thank you, Leopold.<br> They're both nuts.<br> You're not getting away from me.<br> - Mind if I move this truck?<br> - We'd better go in my car.<br> Leopold, will you do me a favour<br> and sit on the floor?<br> Look! Police. I told you.<br> Drive right through.<br> It's a signal to stop. It's the law.<br> - Leopold, get down on the floor.<br> - Yes, Nora.<br> Don't be silly. Stop it.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Where are you going?<br> Just into town.<br> Drop me a little way down the road,<br> will you, please?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> - I don't want to crowd you.<br> - There's plenty of room up here.<br> I'll tell you when we come to it.<br> - Got a cigarette?<br> - No, I'm sorry.<br> That's okay.<br> - What's this place up at the next road?<br> - Trap for Dilg.<br> A kid said he saw him about 3 this<br> afternoon near the reservoir.<br> - Think you'll get him?<br> - No doubt about it.<br> When we do, darned if<br> I don't feel sorry for him.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't know.<br> The word's gone out.<br> "Let's not be too ambitious, boys."<br> - What do you mean?<br> - They'd turn him over to the crowd?<br> If there was a demand.<br> - And they're making sure there is.<br> - Maybe.<br> Here we are.<br> Thanks. If you hear of<br> a good job, let me know.<br> Cramped down there.<br> - Did you hear what he said?<br> - Nonsense.<br> Fellows with badges always have more<br> inside information than the president.<br> Hey, where you going?<br> I don't think I'll have time<br> to take you to the police station.<br> How's that?<br> I've decided to take you to Boston.<br> That's a noble gesture, but that<br> fellow was talking through his hat.<br> My place tonight is in jail.<br> I'm sorry, but we're on the road now.<br> That is taking the law<br> into your own hands.<br> Shut up, will you?<br> Leopold, sometimes there are<br> extenuating circumstances.<br> The letter of the law<br> is sometimes wrong.<br> - I'm afraid I can't agree with you.<br> - Well, I'll have to be firm.<br> - I'll have to pull on your brake.<br> - Stop it. We'll be killed.<br> - Leopold.<br> - What?<br> I can walk.<br> Walk with that ankle?<br> Sure, that'll be all right.<br> Well, Miss Shelley, on to Boston.<br> Professor, you're wonderful.<br> You're really wonderful.<br> Thank you, Nora.<br> Leopold. Poor Leopold.<br> Did he hit you, Leopold?<br> Does that make it feel better?<br> Where did he hit you?<br> Does that feel better?<br> Any mail for John A. Smith?<br> - John A. Smith?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Three hours. My feet are tired.<br> Can't we go someplace for coffee?<br> You'd better stay where you are.<br> - Do you have to stand next to that?<br> - What?<br> Nobody would recognize me from that.<br> Doesn't catch the spirit.<br> - C. Barnard.<br> - C. Barnard?<br> Mr. Bracken.<br> - You've got the wrong party.<br> - I think not.<br> We're leaving for Lochester and<br> inviting you to join us.<br> I'm staying right here.<br> In that case, friend,<br> we may have to insist.<br> You mean violence, professor?<br> Dilg.<br> Look out.<br> Come on, let's have the truth.<br> Turning state's evidence<br> is the only hope you've got.<br> Talk.<br> Leopold, how about stopping the car and<br> giving him another going over?<br> - Pleasure.<br> - Okay.<br> Wait. Holmes paid me to burn it.<br> The factory was on the rocks.<br> His only chance was<br> the insurance money.<br> That's what Leopold said.<br> - Why did you have to play dead?<br> - To get people excited.<br> So Holmes could put Dilg away good.<br> - A very simple plan.<br> - It's astonishing.<br> Well, it won't be long now.<br> Go straight to Lochester City Hall.<br> No, drive straight home.<br> Home? Why?<br> Well, they're apt to mob me first<br> and ask questions afterward.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - Call the district attorney.<br> No, no. Wait. Bracken, go sit down<br> where I can see you.<br> You don't have to call anybody.<br> I'm taking him to City Hall myself.<br> - What?<br> - What about the mob?<br> The mob won't hurt anybody.<br> I just wanted you out of trouble.<br> I don't understand. Why?<br> Professor, you've solved this case<br> beautifully and I'm very grateful...<br> ...but this country needs you<br> on the Supreme Court bench.<br> I don't want to risk losing that.<br> That's thoughtful of you,<br> but I see things differently now.<br> - So do I.<br> - I want to see this job through.<br> I'd sooner do that than hand down a<br> fine piece of literature from the bench.<br> Sorry, but I'm not in accord.<br> This is no time to be<br> doing that act again.<br> Friendly feelings are one thing...<br> ...it's fine of you,<br> but a mob's another thing.<br> I'll take feelings every time.<br> - Please put down that telephone.<br> - I'm sorry, my friend. Police?<br> - I'm warning you.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - Sorry, Leopold. I must.<br> - Now, don't!<br> Police, this is Sweetbrook Cottage.<br> - Dilg and Bracken are both...<br> - Look out!<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Charlie, riot squad.<br> Mr. Lightcap?<br> Mr. Lightcap?<br> What? Again?<br> My goodness, a double-header.<br> Mr. Lightcap. Mr. Lightcap.<br> Is he dead, ma'am?<br> Mr. Lightcap, speak to me.<br> Police! We've got to hide him.<br> Get him in the attic.<br> Take his head. Hurry. Quick.<br> - Dilg!<br> - All right, it's him.<br> Step aside, Miss Shelley.<br> Put the bracelets on him.<br> Get out of here!<br> Keep the town blazing hot<br> against this criminal.<br> They laughed at the Bracken story.<br> I said, how did he get that cut<br> on his head?<br> They say, "Maybe some of our men<br> shot at him in the woods, grazed him."<br> - What's that?<br> - Mob. Parade.<br> They're after your scalp.<br> Holmes is on the job again.<br> This is where we came in,<br> isn't it, Sam?<br> I gotta get busy.<br> Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.<br> All persons having to do<br> with Judge Grunstadt...<br> ...Justice of the Superior Court...<br> ...may now draw near.<br> God save the Commonwealth.<br> Gentlemen, be seated.<br> Nobody believes this Bracken story.<br> Dilg and Yates tried it...<br> ...you'll make yourself<br> ridiculous with it too.<br> Haven't you run enough risk?<br> Will you please get out of this town?<br> No. A man's life is at stake.<br> A friend.<br> I'm warning you,<br> I just came through that town.<br> It's got a desperate look in its eye.<br> They're out for blood.<br> Miss Shelley.<br> Nora, I know just how you feel.<br> I didn't understand at first.<br> I didn't know Leopold.<br> But I know now.<br> You couldn't help feeling<br> the way you do about him.<br> Now don't you start that.<br> Who says I feel any way about anybody?<br> Why does everybody try to<br> make up my mind for me?<br> Why don't you and Leopold<br> mind your own business?<br> Why should my love life be kicked<br> around from pillar to post?<br> I hear you're in love<br> with Regina Bush.<br> - Regina Bush.<br> - Yes.<br> From the salon. How do you like it?<br> Regina Bush.<br> Where did I see a gun around here?<br> - Where is it?<br> - A gun?<br> I know.<br> - Here we are.<br> - It's loaded.<br> - We'd better go back...<br> - No, get my hat.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - I'm going to settle this.<br> - You can't do it.<br> - Oh, can't I?<br> My great-great-grandfather fought off<br> Indians for a whole week in 1756.<br> If that isn't good enough for the<br> Supreme Court bench, it's too bad.<br> What are you going to do?<br> - Where is he?<br> - Who?<br> - Bracken.<br> - He isn't here.<br> Come on out or I'll let you have it!<br> The state will tolerate<br> only one verdict from this jury.<br> And that verdict should be quick:<br> Guilty!<br> - Clyde Bracken, judge.<br> - Bracken?<br> Where are you, Mr. Holmes?<br> Clyde Bracken, alive.<br> There's the man the law<br> is looking for, not Leopold Dilg.<br> His only crime was that<br> he had courage and spoke his mind.<br> This is your law and your finest<br> possession. It makes you free.<br> Why have you come<br> to destroy it?<br> Take those weapons home<br> and burn them, and then think.<br> Think of this country and of the law<br> that makes it what it is.<br> Think of a world crying<br> for this very law.<br> Then you'll understand why<br> you ought to guard it...<br> ...and why the law has got to be the<br> concern of every citizen...<br> ...to uphold it for your neighbour<br> as well as yourself.<br> Violence against it is one mistake.<br> Another mistake is to look upon<br> the law as just a set of principles.<br> Just so much language<br> printed on heavy paper.<br> Something he recites and then takes it<br> for granted that justice is being done.<br> Both kinds of men are equally wrong.<br> The law must be practiced every<br> minute, to the letter and spirit.<br> It can't even exist unless we fight<br> a battle every day to preserve it...<br> ...for our neighbour<br> as well as our self.<br> Could you tell me where I could find<br> Professor Lightcap, please?<br> - In the judge's chambers, madam.<br> - Around there?<br> - Yes, miss.<br> - Thank you.<br> Supreme Court now open.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> You look wonderful, sir.<br> Now, Tilney, you mustn't be absurd.<br> Well, it must be<br> getting near the time.<br> Miss Shelley. Come in, come in.<br> I knew you wouldn't fail me.<br> Well, you...<br> You look fine, Miss Shelley.<br> - You must stop staring.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> It's just a robe, isn't it?<br> And where's Leopold?<br> - I tried to bring him. He disappeared.<br> - Where? Why?<br> - Well, you never can tell about Leopold.<br> - But he must come.<br> Now, why do you look like that?<br> I really don't know. It just<br> all seems so far from Sweetbrook.<br> No, it isn't. Sweetbrook<br> will never be far.<br> That's what I wanted<br> to say to you.<br> Sweetbrook, those few weeks there...<br> I wonder if I can say this as I want to.<br> Well, what I'm trying to say...<br> You see... Look at me.<br> A dream of 20 years come true.<br> More happiness than any man deserves.<br> That chair... But now there's<br> something else, Nora: My friends.<br> I want to see them as happy as I am.<br> Nothing less will do.<br> Leopold, what a fine fellow.<br> I've been thinking, Nora, that if<br> someone took his hand and said...<br> ..."Leopold, my reckless friend, here's<br> love and companionship forever."<br> Well, some day that man would...<br> You see what I mean, Nora?<br> Mr. Justice, it's time, sir.<br> Mr. Justice.<br> Far from Sweetbrook? Never.<br> Leopold.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - That's all I wanted to see.<br> The rest is about law, very boring.<br> - He looks fine up there, doesn't he?<br> - Yes.<br> Our country's in good hands.<br> The woman's touch. Indispensable.<br> - You better go back in.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Home. Lochester. What about it?<br> - Then what?<br> You're gonna like Washington.<br> Wonderful town.<br> He's a wonderful man too.<br> Position, dignity, a place in life.<br> Exactly where a fine woman belongs.<br> Well, Nora...<br> ...see you sometime.<br> - Leopold.<br> - Go back in. He may be looking for you.<br> I'm getting tired of people trying<br> to make up my mind for me.<br> Well, stop it and do as I tell you.<br> - Leopold.<br> - Stubborn women, they're a curse.<br> - My mother always warned me.<br> - Leopold.<br> Now, stop following me<br> or I'll call the police...<br>
