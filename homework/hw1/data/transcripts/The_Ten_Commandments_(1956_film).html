                        Ladies and gentlemen, young and old,<br> this may seem an unusual procedure,<br> speaking to you<br> before the picture begins,<br> but we have an unusual subject:<br> the story of the birth of freedom.<br> The story of Moses.<br> As many of you know,<br> the Holy Bible omits<br> some 30 years of Moses' life,<br> from the time he was<br> a three-month-old baby<br> and was found in the bulrushes<br> by Bithiah,<br> the daughter of Pharaoh,<br> and adopted into the court of Egypt<br> until he learned that he was Hebrew<br> and killed the Egyptian.<br> To fill in those missing years,<br> we turned to ancient historians<br> such as Philo and Josephus.<br> Philo wrote at the time that<br> Jesus of Nazareth walked the Earth,<br> and Josephus wrote some 50 years later<br> and watched the destruction<br> of Jerusalem by the Romans.<br> These historians had access<br> to documents<br> long since destroyed,<br> or perhaps lost,<br> like the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br> The theme of this picture<br> is whether men are<br> to be ruled by God's law,<br> or whether they are to be ruled by<br> the whims of a dictator like Rameses.<br> Are men the property of the state,<br> or are they free souls under God?<br> This same battle continues<br> throughout the world today.<br> Our intention was not to create a story,<br> but to be worthy<br> of the divinely inspired story<br> created 3,000 years ago:<br> the five books of Moses.<br> The story takes three hours<br> and 39 minutes to unfold.<br> There will be an intermission.<br> Thank you for your attention.<br> And God said, "Let there be light. "<br> And there was light.<br> And from this light,<br> God created life upon Earth.<br> And man was given dominion<br> over all things upon this Earth,<br> and the power to choose<br> between good and evil,<br> but each sought to do his own will<br> because he knew not<br> the light of God's law.<br> Man took dominion over man.<br> The conquered<br> were made to serve the conqueror<br> The weak were made to serve the strong.<br> And freedom was gone from the world.<br> So did the Egyptians<br> cause the children of Israel<br> to serve with rigor;<br> and their lives were made bitter<br> with hard bondage,<br> and their cry came up unto God<br> and God heard them.<br> And cast into Egypt,<br> into the lowly hut<br> of Amram and Yochabel,<br> the seed of a man<br> upon whose mind and heart<br> would be written<br> God's law and God's commandments.<br> One man to stand alone<br> against an empire.<br> Divine One,<br> last night our astrologers<br> saw an evil star<br> - enter into the house of Egypt.<br> - Meaning war?<br> From the frontiers of Sinai and Libya<br> to the cataracts of the Nile.<br> What nation would dare<br> draw the sword against us?<br> The enemy to fear<br> is in the heart of Egypt.<br> What?<br> The Hebrew slaves<br> in the land of Goshen.<br> I number my enemies by their swords,<br> not by their chains, High Priest.<br> Chains have been forged<br> into swords before now, Divine One.<br> Among these slaves,<br> there is a prophecy of a deliverer<br> who will lead them out of bondage.<br> The star proclaims his birth.<br> Then let the Hebrews die.<br> Slaves are wealth, Commander.<br> The more slaves we have,<br> the more bricks we make.<br> I would still see fewer bricks made<br> and fewer Hebrews in Goshen.<br> It is our eastern gate.<br> Since this deliverer<br> is among their newborn,<br> only their newborn need die.<br> Every newborn Hebrew man-child<br> shall die.<br> So let it be written,<br> so let it be done.<br> So speaks Rameses I.<br> No!<br> Oh, no!<br> Please! Please! No!<br> God of Abraham,<br> take my child into thy hands,<br> that he may live to thy service.<br> But Mother,<br> we have not even given him a name.<br> God will give him a name.<br> Follow it, Miriam.<br> Watch it from the reeds.<br> - See where the Lord will lead him.<br> - Yes, Mother.<br> - Why didn't you say no?<br> - She didn't think of it.<br> Here! Throw!<br> - You're getting fat.<br> - Too many sesame cakes!<br> Catch a lotus and you catch a wish.<br> What will you wish for,<br> Tuya, gold or a man?<br> Gold, of course.<br> - Then I could have any man!<br> - Gold will never fill an empty heart.<br> Quiet, you chattering geese.<br> Memnet, you're only happy<br> when you're miserable.<br> You fools! Talk of empty hearts<br> before the Pharaoh's daughter.<br> What is there in her heart,<br> but the memory of a dead husband?<br> We meant no harm, Memnet.<br> Look, there's something here!<br> Be sure it's not a crocodile!<br> Bithiah can charm tears<br> from a crocodile.<br> What is it, Bithiah?<br> What did you End?<br> Only a drifting basket.<br> - Shall we come and help you get it?<br> - Memnet, send the girls away.<br> I'd rather be alone now.<br> Now see what you've done.<br> Back to the palace, all of you.<br> - Go on. All of you. Musicians, too.<br> - We wouldn't hurt Bithiah.<br> Bithiah's tired of you and so am I.<br> Off you go.<br> - You're tired of everything.<br> - Go on. Off you go.<br> Go on. Hurry up!<br> You've hurt her enough.<br> - What have you found?<br> - The answer to my prayers.<br> You prayed for a basket?<br> No. I prayed for a son.<br> Your husband<br> is in the house of the dead.<br> And he has asked the Nile god<br> to bring me this beautiful boy.<br> Do you know the pattern<br> of this cloth?<br> If my son is covered in it...<br> ...it is a royal robe.<br> Royal? It is the Levite cloth<br> of a Hebrew slave.<br> This child was put upon the water<br> to save its life<br> from your father's edict.<br> I am the Pharaoh's daughter,<br> and this is my son.<br> He shall be reared in my house<br> as the Prince of the Two Lands.<br> My mother and her mother before her<br> were branded to the Pharaoh's service.<br> I will not see you make this son<br> of slaves a prince of Egypt.<br> You will see it, Memnet.<br> You will see him walk<br> with his head among the eagles.<br> And you will serve him as you serve me.<br> Fill the ark with water.<br> Sink it into silence.<br> Raise your hands, Memnet.<br> What you have buried in the Nile<br> shall remain buried in your heart.<br> - Swear it.<br> - I will be silent.<br> The day you break that oath will be<br> the last your eyes shall ever see.<br> You will be the glory of Egypt, my son.<br> Mighty in words and deeds.<br> Kings shall bow before you.<br> Your name will live<br> when the pyramids are dust.<br> And...<br> ...because I drew you from the water,<br> you shall be called Moses.<br> Moses! Moses!<br> Moses...<br> He proclaims his coming from afar,<br> does he not, my son?<br> Such favor with the people<br> can be dangerous, Great Sethi.<br> To whom, Rameses? To me or to you?<br> It would not be the first time that fame<br> has turned a prince against his Pharaoh.<br> Or that envy has turned a brother<br> against his brother.<br> Envy is for the weak.<br> And beauty is for the strong.<br> That is what you have in mind.<br> If you mean Nefretiri, yes, my father.<br> Is it the princess'<br> beauty that attracts you, Rameses,<br> or the fact that she must marry the man<br> I choose to follow me on the throne?<br> I am the son of your body.<br> Who else could be your heir?<br> The man best able to rule Egypt<br> will follow me.<br> I owe that to my fathers,<br> not to my sons.<br> - Then I shall follow you.<br> - Shall you?<br> Do not let ambition<br> shave your prince's lock.<br> I sent Moses to destroy a city.<br> He returns in triumph.<br> I sent you to build a city.<br> Where is it?<br> It will rise when I have put fear<br> into the stiff-necked<br> Hebrew slaves who build it.<br> But this I know, my father:<br> no pretended brother<br> will ever have your crown...<br> ...or Nefretiri.<br> Indeed?<br> Whoever I choose shall have my crown...<br> ...and Nefretiri.<br> I think I see him, Memnet.<br> Moses...<br> Yes, I can see him!<br> Moses!<br> Listen, Memnet. Listen.<br> The trumpets tell all the world<br> he's come back to me.<br> Hear them.<br> And all those shouts are drowned<br> by the beating of my heart.<br> - Moses!<br> - Do you hear, Memnet?<br> - The whole city calls his name.<br> - I hear them, Nefretiri.<br> The Lord Moses, Prince of Egypt,<br> son of the Pharaoh's sister,<br> beloved of the Nile god,<br> commander of the Southern Host.<br> Welcome home!<br> - Prince Moses!<br> - The blessings of the god Amun-Ra<br> be upon you, Great Prince.<br> He has brought down<br> the pride of Ethiopia.<br> - Yes, that is...<br> - The old windbag.<br> - I agree with him.<br> - May your name be exalted on Earth,<br> o' conqueror, even as the sun<br> is exalted in the heavens.<br> Welcome to my sister's son.<br> We have heard how you took<br> ibis from the Nile<br> to destroy the venomous serpents<br> used against you<br> when you laid siege<br> to the city of Saba.<br> May my arms stay strong<br> in your service, Great Sethi.<br> Who is this fair young god<br> come into the house of Pharaoh?<br> No need to tell you<br> how I share her joy at your return-<br> No need, my brother.<br> Great one, I bring you Ethiopia!<br> Command them to kneel before Pharaoh.<br> Command what you have conquered,<br> my brother.<br> I bring the Ethiopian king<br> and his sister in friendship,<br> as an ally to guard our southern gates.<br> My son has dealt wisely with you,<br> Ethiopia. Welcome as a friend.<br> Great king, I will ask<br> but one favor of your friendship.<br> This green stone from our mountains,<br> that I may give it to your<br> Prince of Egypt,<br> for he is kind, as well as wise.<br> It is pleasing to the gods to see<br> a man honored by his enemies.<br> And such a beautiful enemy!<br> See to their comfort.<br> Divine One, here is the full count<br> of Ethiopia's tribute.<br> Bearers!<br> I am sending down the Nile 20 full<br> barges of such wealth as you see here.<br> Logs of ebony and trees of myrrh,<br> all for your new treasure city.<br> A handsome tribute indeed, Moses.<br> Unfortunately,<br> I have no new treasure city.<br> And you will have none.<br> The stiff-necked slaves<br> die more willingly<br> -than bend their backs in your service.<br> - Why?<br> They believe a deliverer has come<br> to lead them from their bondage.<br> Deliverer? Deliverer?!<br> He has been foretold by every falling<br> star since my father's time.<br> Now, you make him an excuse<br> for your failure to build my city.<br> I am not one to make excuses-<br> If you doubt me,<br> let Moses build a city.<br> No! No.<br> He's just trying<br> to keep Moses away from you, Sethi.<br> Or you, perhaps.<br> I think our roosters would crow<br> more softly on another roof.<br> Stand before me, both of you.<br> Would you please your Pharaoh, Moses?<br> - Your wish is my will.<br> - Then you build my city.<br> A wise decision.<br> A noble task.<br> Rameses, do you believe<br> this slave deliverer is a myth?<br> What I believe is of no account.<br> What matters is<br> the slaves believe in him.<br> Of course, of course.<br> Then you, too, shall go to Goshen-<br> Learn if this deliverer<br> be a myth or a man.<br> If a myth, bring him to me in a bottle.<br> If a man,<br> bring him to me in chains.<br> So let it be written,<br> so let it be done.<br> Your fragrance<br> is like the wine of Babylon.<br> I could...<br> But you are the throne princess,<br> and by the Pharaoh's law,<br> you can marry only a Pharaoh.<br> I shall marry a Pharaoh...<br> ...you.<br> Rameses might not agree<br> with that idea.<br> But Sethi might.<br> While you were gone,<br> I kept your name on his lips,<br> your praises in his ears.<br> But now, unless you can succeed,<br> you'll be the prince<br> of some desert province<br> and I'll be Rameses' wife. Oh, Moses!<br> Build a city for him,<br> and Sethi will deny you nothing.<br> I will build the city for love of Sethi,<br> not for the throne of Egypt.<br> But I am Egypt.<br> Now, the flame you lighted<br> burns close to the throne.<br> Your tongue would dig<br> your grave, Memnet.<br> A conqueror already conquered?<br> The first face I looked for<br> and the last I find. Mother.<br> I was thanking the gods<br> for your safe return.<br> But I find you in grave danger here.<br> In intoxicating danger, Mother.<br> Marry her if you can, my son,<br> but never fall in love with her.<br> I'll be less trouble to him<br> than the Hebrew slaves of Goshen.<br> Goshen?<br> You've guzzled enough.<br> Bring those bricks up and get on.<br> You, there's other swine to water.<br> Water girl! Water!<br> Get those bricks back on.<br> Here! Water lily!<br> My name is Lilia.<br> To me you are a lily,<br> and I want water.<br> Joshua...<br> Joshua, I thought<br> you'd never come down.<br> Water before love, my girl.<br> Does it take the whole Nile<br> to quench your thirst?<br> No, just your lips.<br> Be careful, my love.<br> Dathan's eyes can see through stone.<br> Dathan is a vulture feeding<br> on the flesh of his own people.<br> When he looks at me, I'm afraid.<br> If he touches you,<br> I'll strangle him with his own whip.<br> And bring death to 1,000 others?<br> Is life in bondage better than death?<br> Joshua, we must have hope.<br> God will send us the deliverer.<br> Hope? On the heels<br> of every hope walks Dathan.<br> You're Dathan, the Hebrew overseer.<br> Chief Hebrew overseer, mighty one.<br> Baka, the master builder,<br> has told me that I can rely on you.<br> I am warmed by his favor.<br> Rely on you to sell<br> your own mother for a price.<br> And who am I to deny the word<br> of the master builder?<br> Where is this would-be deliverer<br> who would set the Hebrews free?<br> Who can say, immortal prince?<br> They do not confide in me.<br> - But it is possible to learn.<br> - No doubt.<br> You have rat's ears and a ferret's nose.<br> To use in your service, son of Pharaoh.<br> Add to them the eyes of a weasel<br> and find me this deliverer.<br> Lean your backs into it!<br> Old woman! Old woman!<br> More grease under the center stone.<br> - Yochabel!<br> - Help me!<br> Stop the stone!<br> Keep pulling up there.<br> Yochabel is caught. Stop the stone!<br> Come on, pull!<br> Pull!<br> Pull!<br> - Pull!<br> - You'll kill her! Stop the stone!<br> We don't stop a moving block<br> for an old woman.<br> Lay on the lash! Keep it moving!<br> Stop the stone! Stop the stone!<br> Hold the ropes!<br> Water! Water!<br> - Cut the old woman loose.<br> - She'll stay where she is,<br> and you'll die in the lion pits.<br> - Joshua!<br> - Run to the prince and beg mercy.<br> - Mercy from Rameses?!<br> - No, no.<br> The Prince Moses,<br> there on the pavilion.<br> - After her! After her!<br> - Hold him!<br> Stop her!<br> Stop that girl!<br> The water girl, stop her!<br> Stop that girl! Stop her!<br> Mercy, Prince Moses!<br> - Mercy, Prince Moses!<br> - Come here.<br> - Mercy? What have you done?<br> - Not for myself, Lord Prince.<br> For a slave who saved old Yochabel<br> and me from death<br> between the granite blocks.<br> A delicate flower<br> to be pressed between walls of stone.<br> How were you saved?<br> A stonecutter struck the overseer.<br> There can be only one punishment<br> for the stonecutter.<br> Blood makes poor mortar. Come.<br> Prince Moses!<br> Get away, you!<br> Would you bury the old woman alive<br> in a tomb of rock?<br> My noble one, it caught.<br> I had not the strength to free myself.<br> Your shoulder should not<br> bear a burden, old woman.<br> The Lord has renewed my strength<br> and lightened my burdens.<br> He would have done better<br> to remove them.<br> They use the old ones to do the work<br> of greasing the stones, Lord Prince.<br> If they are killed, it is no loss.<br> Are you a master builder<br> or a master butcher?<br> If we stopped moving stones<br> for every grease woman who falls,<br> the city would never rise.<br> If the slaves are not driven<br> they will not work.<br> If their work lags,<br> it is because they are not fed.<br> You seem strong enough.<br> I am a stonecutter.<br> The Pharaohs like their images cut deep.<br> Hold your whip!<br> You know it is death<br> to strike an Egyptian?<br> I know it.<br> - Yet you struck him? Why?<br> - To save the old woman.<br> - What is she to you?<br> - An old woman.<br> Lord Prince, send him to his death.<br> The man has courage.<br> You do not speak like a slave.<br> God made men.<br> - Men made slaves.<br> - Which god?<br> The God of Abraham, the Almighty God.<br> If your god is almighty,<br> why does he leave you in bondage?<br> He will choose the hour<br> of our freedom<br> and the man who will deliver us.<br> - Lord Prince, this man speaks treason.<br> - It is not treason to want freedom.<br> Release him.<br> Difficulty with the slaves, my brother?<br> None that could not be cured by<br> a ration of grain and a day of rest.<br> A day of rest?<br> When your horses tire, they're rested.<br> When they hunger, they're fed.<br> Slaves draw stone and brick.<br> My horses draw the next Pharaoh.<br> Is there any grain<br> stored here in Goshen?<br> None that you would<br> dare take, my brother.<br> The temple granaries are full.<br> Bring the push-pole men<br> and some women with baskets.<br> I will... great prince.<br> I warn you, Moses,<br> the temple grain belongs to the gods.<br> What the gods can digest will<br> not sour in the belly of a slave.<br> - Push-pole men!<br> - You, back where you belong!<br> I have the prince's orders.<br> One and two poles, up!<br> - Bring 100 women with baskets.<br> - Elisheba, bring your basket.<br> Push-polers, follow me.<br> Out of the way!<br> Break open the bins.<br> Out of the way. Stand back.<br> Well, well.<br> Divine One.<br> There!<br> My jackals have your hounds at bay-<br> Dogs at bay are dangerous.<br> When they walk upright<br> and feed on temple grain.<br> Of course. You've been bringing<br> petitions against Moses for months.<br> Well, the city's being built<br> and I'm winning this game,<br> so don't interrupt us with trifles.<br> Before your city is finished,<br> these trifles will surprise you.<br> Life is full of surprises.<br> And today I have one for you, my kitten.<br> Moses!<br> And Rameses.<br> You crocodile!<br> Triples. You've lost.<br> I'll never let you win again.<br> You thought that by losing to me<br> you would win for Moses.<br> Well, you know, crowns are sometimes<br> lost by smiles and dimples.<br> - And so is patience.<br> - Yours?<br> Are the plans for my jubilee complete?<br> All but your proclamation for the<br> marriage of Prince Rameses to Nefretiri.<br> No.<br> Are you quite sure it will be Rameses?<br> Who else could be your successor?<br> Moses, of course.<br> Because of Moses there is no wheat<br> in the temple granaries.<br> You don't look any leaner. You're both<br> very generous with your advice.<br> Will you take mine?<br> No, I will choose my own successor-<br> Did you lose your head, my sweet?<br> I sent you to Goshen<br> to bring me the head of the jackal<br> who would free the slaves.<br> Where is it?<br> The slaves do not need a deliverer now.<br> - They have Moses.<br> - Is that a riddle?<br> He gives them the priests' grain<br> and one day in seven to rest.<br> They call it the day of Moses.<br> - This man makes himself a god.<br> - I prefer him as a man.<br> You would prefer him as Pharaoh.<br> - Are you afraid of Moses?<br> - Yes.<br> 'Cause now he holds Ethiopia<br> in his left hand,<br> Goshen in his right, and you,<br> my Pharaoh, are in between them.<br> Do you imply that he<br> would raise the slaves against me?<br> - I've been his father.<br> - Ambition knows no father.<br> Moses could no more betray you<br> than I could, Sethi.<br> He can tell me that when he arrives.<br> - He will not be here, my father.<br> - What?<br> I sent for both of you.<br> His word is that he cannot attend you,<br> being pressed by...<br> ...other matters.<br> Did you hear that? Other matters?<br> My escort.<br> I will ride with you, my son,<br> to see what rears itself in Goshen,<br> a city or treason.<br> You lying adder! You'll destroy<br> yourself with your own venom<br> if you try to turn Sethi against Moses.<br> You would turn Sethi against me.<br> Remember, my sweet, that you must<br> be wife to the next Pharaoh,<br> that you're going to be mine,<br> all mine,<br> like my dog or my horse or my falcon.<br> Only I will love you more,<br> and trust you less.<br> You will never do the things to me<br> you would have done to Moses.<br> I know you, my sweet.<br> You're a sharp-clawed,<br> treacherous little peacock.<br> But you're food for the gods,<br> and I'm going to have all of you.<br> None of me.<br> Did you think my kiss<br> was a promise of what you'll have?<br> No, my pompous one,<br> it was to let you know<br> what you will not have.<br> I could never love you.<br> Does that matter?<br> You will be my wife.<br> You will come to me whenever I call you.<br> And I will enjoy that very much.<br> Whether you enjoy it or not<br> is your own affair.<br> But I think you will.<br> That drop puts too much strain<br> on the stone. We need more sand.<br> I'm going to risk it, Baka.<br> There's little time<br> till the day of jubilee.<br> If the stone cracks,<br> you may crack with it.<br> Ready blue signal.<br> Blue pennant.<br> Blue pennant!<br> - The snubber is ready.<br> - Green pennant.<br> Mallet men, ready!<br> Mallet men, ready, stand by!<br> Clear the main hawser!<br> Mallet men ready.<br> You are not pleased to see me here.<br> I am, Great Pharaoh, but now<br> I have important things to do.<br> Red pennant, stand by.<br> So Rameses tells me.<br> More important things<br> than obeying my orders?<br> You ordered me to finish this city-<br> The strain in that stone is too great-<br> We cannot wait. Red pennant.<br> Red pennant... strike!<br> - The stone will break.<br> - There are 2,000 slaves on the ropes.<br> There is the obelisk of your jubilee.<br> Baka, put 1,000 slaves<br> to removing the sand<br> until the stone settles to its base.<br> - Pharaoh is pleased?<br> - With the obelisk, yes,<br> but not with certain accusations<br> made against you.<br> By whom?<br> - You raided the temple granaries?<br> - Yes.<br> - You gave the grain to the slaves?<br> - Yes.<br> You gave them one day in seven to rest.<br> Yes-<br> Did you do all of this<br> to gain their favor?<br> A city is built of brick, Pharaoh.<br> The strong make many.<br> The starving make few.<br> The dead make none.<br> So much for accusations.<br> Now, judge the results.<br> The pylons commemorate your victory<br> at Kadesh,<br> where you broke the Amorites.<br> - Are there any higher in Egypt?<br> - There are none higher in the world.<br> With so many slaves,<br> you could build... an army.<br> But I have built a city.<br> Sixteen of these lions of Pharaoh<br> will guard its gates.<br> And it shall be the city<br> of Sethi's glory.<br> Are these slaves loyal<br> to Sethi's glory,<br> or to you, Moses?<br> The slaves worship their god...<br> ...and I serve only you.<br> Let your own image proclaim<br> my loyalty for a thousand years.<br> Superb!<br> Rameses.<br> And this you call treason?<br> Who would take a throne by force<br> that he has earned by deeds?<br> With this and Ethiopia,<br> your name shall be carved<br> beside mine on every pylon.<br> Yours, Rameses, will be nowhere.<br> In my judgment book, you have<br> accused your brother falsely.<br> Come.<br> Great Pharaoh,<br> he is the son of your body.<br> I need no help, Moses,<br> to hold what is mine.<br> I decide what is yours.<br> Come with me, Moses.<br> Will you lose the throne<br> because Moses builds a city?<br> The city that he builds<br> shall bear my name.<br> The woman that he loves<br> shall bear my child.<br> So it shall be written.<br> So it shall be done.<br> Yes. This is for the temple ceremony.<br> This...<br> This...<br> ...is for my wedding night.<br> You will never wear it.<br> Why not?<br> I have brought you a cloth<br> more revealing. Send them away.<br> Go, then, while I hear what this<br> puckered old persimmon has to say.<br> Well? What croakings<br> of doom have you today?<br> You prepare for a marriage<br> that will never be.<br> You've been drinking honey wine!<br> I shall not let the Pharaoh<br> and Rameses be betrayed.<br> Why should a slave care<br> which Pharaoh rules?<br> For 30 years, I have been silent.<br> Now, all the kings of Egypt<br> cry out to me from their tombs,<br> "Let no Hebrew sit upon our throne."<br> What are you saying?<br> Rameses has the blood of many kings.<br> - And Moses?<br> - He is lower than the dust.<br> Not one drop of royal blood<br> flows through his veins.<br> He is the son of Hebrew slaves.<br> I'll have you torn into so many pieces,<br> even the vultures won't find them.<br> Who hatched this lie? Rameses?<br> Rameses does not know... yet.<br> You will repeat this to Bithiah!<br> It was Bithiah who drew a slave child<br> from the Nile,<br> called him son and Prince of Egypt,<br> blinding herself to the truth<br> and the pain of an empty womb.<br> Were you alone with Bithiah?<br> A little girl led me<br> to the Hebrew woman Yochabel,<br> that the child might<br> be suckled by his true mother.<br> Take care, old frog.<br> You croak too much against Moses.<br> Would you mingle the blood<br> of slaves with your own?<br> He will be my husband.<br> I shall have no other.<br> Then use this to wrap your first-born.<br> Torn from a Levite's robe.<br> It was Moses' swaddling cloth.<br> And your shroud!<br> You think I care whose son he is?<br> - Rameses cares.<br> - You won't live to tell him.<br> Nefretiri?<br> Nefretiri! Have you closed your doors<br> to make a beggar of a prince?<br> I'm the beggar, Moses, begging you<br> to hold me in your arms. Kiss me.<br> Just kiss me.<br> You're no beggar, my love.<br> You're a conqueror,<br> and I am your captive for life.<br> One lifetime will not be half enough.<br> You will be King of Egypt.<br> And I will be your footstool.<br> A man stupid enough<br> to use you for a footstool<br> would not be wise enough to rule Egypt.<br> Princess!<br> Princess, the raven has dropped<br> a black feather at your door.<br> - Who can...?<br> - No, Moses, leave the world outside.<br> Pardon, pardon, royal one.<br> - The old nurse, Memnet...<br> - Go away.<br> - I don't want to hear anything.<br> - What about Memnet?<br> She's dead. She must<br> have fallen from the balcony.<br> I will not hear unhappy things tonight.<br> Go away!<br> Old Memnet must have walked<br> that balcony a thousand times.<br> What is the death of one slave to us?<br> She was a faithful servant to you.<br> Can one so rich in love<br> be so poor in pity?<br> What kind of a woman<br> holds me captive?<br> One who loves you<br> and will not lose you.<br> One who will be your wife. Nothing in<br> the world can change that. Nothing.<br> Neither Rameses' princely plots<br> nor Memnet's evil lies.<br> You've heard Memnet grumbling<br> all your life.<br> Why should it upset you now?<br> Because she grumbled against you.<br> Oh, let her threats be buried with her.<br> Look, the night's a crown of stars,<br> and the darkness a robe<br> of forgetfulness.<br> Come, love. Let's share them.<br> We'll use the moon for a scepter.<br> - A piece of Hebrew cloth!<br> - Memnet may have dropped it.<br> Memnet was not Hebrew.<br> Why would she bring this here?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Yes, you do.<br> - Tell me.<br> - She was taking it to Rameses...<br> - ...to destroy you.<br> - To de...?<br> How could Rameses destroy me<br> with a piece of cloth?<br> Moses, Moses, why do you question<br> me? Why do you care? Yes!<br> I killed her.<br> What does it matter?<br> A hundred slaves die every day.<br> - What's done is forgotten.<br> - It is not forgotten.<br> What is this cloth<br> to do with me? Tell me.<br> It will make no difference between us?<br> How could it make a difference?<br> A child was wrapped in it.<br> - What child?<br> - Bithiah took him from the river.<br> Memnet was with her.<br> Who was this child?<br> Memnet is dead. No one need know<br> who you are. I love you.<br> I killed for you.<br> I'll kill anyone that comes between us.<br> Why did you kill for me, Nefretiri?<br> If you love me, do not lie.<br> Who was the child?<br> Hold me in your arms.<br> Hold me... close.<br> You were not born<br> Prince of Egypt, Moses...<br> ...but the son of Hebrew slaves.<br> You believe that?<br> I'll believe anything<br> you want me to believe.<br> Say you are not,<br> I'll believe you are not.<br> Love cannot drown truth, Nefretiri.<br> You do believe it,<br> or you would not have killed Memnet.<br> I love you.<br> That's the only truth I know.<br> Did this child of the Nile<br> have a mother?<br> Memnet called her Yochabel.<br> I will ask Bithiah.<br> How could you doubt me?<br> You did not doubt me when I held you<br> as you took your first step.<br> It's a wicked lie spun by Rameses.<br> Mother, did Rameses spin this?<br> The word of your mother against<br> a piece of cloth found by Memnet?<br> How did you know it was Memnet?<br> Who else? Memnet nursed Rameses.<br> She shall pay for spreading his lies.<br> - She has paid.<br> - She's dead?<br> At the hand of Nefretiri.<br> Put away any fears or suspicions<br> that may remain with you, my son.<br> Why, your will will be law in Egypt<br> when you are crowned<br> and sceptered as her king.<br> Memnet spoke of a Hebrew woman<br> named Yochabel.<br> Did you ever know her?<br> No.<br> Yours was the face<br> I saw above my cradle,<br> the only mother I've ever known.<br> Wherever I am led<br> or whatever I must do,<br> I will always love you.<br> My chariot. I will drive to Goshen.<br> A chariot here in Goshen?<br> - You know who I am?<br> - It has been many years, great one.<br> - Who are they?<br> - All that remain of my children.<br> I will speak to you alone.<br> Why have you...?<br> - Why have you come here?<br> - Because Moses will come here.<br> - My son?<br> - No, my son.<br> And that's all that he must know.<br> My lips might deny him, great one,<br> but my eyes never could.<br> You shall leave Goshen,<br> you and your family, tonight.<br> We are Levites,<br> appointed shepherds of Israel.<br> We cannot leave our people.<br> Would you take from Moses<br> all that I have given him?<br> Would you undo all<br> that I have done for him?<br> I have put the throne of Egypt<br> within his reach.<br> - What can you give him in its place?<br> - I gave him life.<br> I gave him love!<br> Was it your hand that dried his tears?<br> And when he was troubled,<br> was it your heart that ached for him?<br> Yes-<br> My heart ached for him.<br> And my arms ached to hold him,<br> but I dared not even touch<br> the hem of his garment.<br> His heritage from me<br> could only have been misery,<br> poverty and the lash.<br> No, I will not take from him the<br> glory and riches you have given him.<br> For this you shall be well cared for.<br> You and your family shall be taken<br> from Goshen tonight.<br> No matter where you send me,<br> if the God of Abraham<br> has a purpose for my son,<br> he will come to know it and fulfill it.<br> Come, gather your things, quickly.<br> Quickly.<br> I shall see you want for nothing.<br> You and your children<br> shall be given freedom.<br> Has my mother forgotten?<br> Only the Pharaoh can free a slave.<br> Moses! Do not enter.<br> There is only sorrow here.<br> Are you comforting it, my mother?<br> I followed you here<br> to find this woman, Yochabel...<br> You were the woman<br> who was caught between the stones.<br> - Until you came.<br> - My son, if you love me...<br> I love you, my mother,<br> but am I your son?<br> Or yours?<br> No, you are not my son.<br> If you believe that men and women<br> are cattle to be driven under the lash,<br> if you can bow before idols of stone<br> and golden images of beasts...<br> ...you are not my son.<br> My son would be a slave.<br> His hands would be gnarled<br> and broken from the brick pits,<br> his back scarred<br> from the taskmaster's whip,<br> but in his heart would burn<br> the spirit of the living God.<br> Does this god demand<br> a scarred back and broken hands<br> as the price of his favor?<br> This desert god<br> is the hope of the hopeless.<br> Your place is in the palace halls.<br> You have mounted<br> to the sun on golden wings.<br> You belong to me, to Nefretiri,<br> to Sethi, to all those who love you.<br> Do they love less who have no hope?<br> Will you swear in the name of this god<br> that you are not my mother?<br> We do not even know his name.<br> Then look into my eyes<br> and tell me you are not my mother.<br> Oh, Moses, Moses! I cannot, I cannot.<br> I am your brother Aaron.<br> I am Miriam, your sister.<br> - I am your brother Moses.<br> - No! Get ready to leave. Hurry!<br> They're going away, Moses.<br> The secret's going with them.<br> No one need ever know<br> the shame I brought upon you.<br> Shame?<br> What change is there in me?<br> Egyptian or Hebrew, I am still Moses.<br> These are the same hands,<br> the same arms,<br> the same face<br> that were mine a moment ago.<br> A moment ago, you were her son,<br> the strength of Egypt.<br> Now, you are mine, a slave of Egypt.<br> You find no shame in this?<br> There is no shame in me. How can I<br> feel shame for the woman who bore me?<br> - Or the race that bred me?<br> - God of my fathers.<br> Moses, what will you do?<br> This is the binding tie...<br> ...and here I will stay.<br> - Moses...<br> - To find the meaning of what I am.<br> Why a Hebrew, or any man,<br> must be a slave.<br> Put back your things.<br> You are not leaving.<br> Moses?<br> Has she done more for you than I?<br> Will the life she gave you be more<br> useful in the black pits of slavery?<br> Cannot justice and truth<br> be served better upon a throne<br> where all men may benefit<br> from your goodness<br> and strength?<br> I do not know<br> what power shapes my way,<br> but my feet are set upon a road<br> that I must follow.<br> Forgive me, Bithiah.<br> God of our fathers,<br> who has appointed<br> an end to the bondage of Israel,<br> blessed am I<br> among all mothers in the land,<br> for my eyes have beheld thy deliverer.<br> Thou shalt not muzzle the ox<br> that treadeth out the com,<br> making straw for the bricks of Egypt,<br> nor spare the arms that endlessly<br> winnow the grain in the wind<br> to separate the wheat from the chaff<br> wheat borne stolidly<br> on the backs of countless slaves<br> from the heavy-laden Nile boats<br> to the teeming shore.<br> Endlessly they plod<br> beneath the sheaves of wheat<br> and endlessly return for more.<br> A golden harvest to the threshers,<br> a grain safe to feed the masters,<br> bitterness to feed the slaves,<br> and to feed the brick pits, straw,<br> carried on the bowed backs of women<br> down into the never-ending valley<br> of toil and agony,<br> stretching mile after mile.<br> An inferno of mud-soaked bodies,<br> where the treaders' feet<br> churn clay and straw<br> into the mixture<br> for the Pharaoh 's bricks.<br> And everywhere the lash<br> of watchful taskmasters<br> ready to sting the backs of the weary.<br> Blades chopping straw.<br> Mattocks chopping clay.<br> A ceaseless cycle of unending drudgery.<br> From the mixing feet of treaders<br> to the pouring hands of brick molders<br> moves the constant stream of mud,<br> the lowly seed of tall cities,<br> day after day, year after year;<br> century after century.<br> Bondage without rest,<br> toil without reward.<br> These are the children of misery,<br> the afflicted,<br> the hopeless, the oppressed.<br> And he went out unto his brethren<br> and looked on their burdens.<br> Water girl!<br> Here, here's water.<br> That's a hard dance you do, old man.<br> We've been dancing it for 400 years...<br> ...to grim music.<br> And the only deliverer<br> that has come to us is death.<br> Back to work, you braying mules.<br> You're strange to the pits.<br> Your back is unscarred.<br> You bring a warm smile<br> with your cool water.<br> My smile is for a stonecutter.<br> - The water is for you.<br> - I thank you.<br> Your voice is not strange.<br> - You are...?<br> - One of many who thirst.<br> You there!<br> Come here.<br> That is Baka, the master builder.<br> - Does he call me or you?<br> - You! Water girl! I'm thirsty.<br> He does not thirst for water.<br> Beauty is but a curse to our women.<br> - Water, noble one?<br> - No, wine... the wine of beauty.<br> What beauty can my lord find<br> in these mud pits?<br> The lotus flower blooms<br> in the Nile's gray mud.<br> Dathan, she will do well<br> as a house slave.<br> Do not take me from my people!<br> There would be danger.<br> Danger from such lovely hands?<br> There are other hands,<br> strong enough to kill.<br> Our mud flower has a thorn.<br> Oh, please, Lord Baka, I beg you.<br> Tears..-<br> When you have been bathed<br> in scented water,<br> when your limbs have<br> been caressed by sweet oils<br> and your hair combed with sandalwood,<br> there will be no time for tears.<br> She is not worthy of your magnificence.<br> Let my eyes...<br> Your eyes had best find the deliverer,<br> Dathan, or you will have no eyes.<br> Bring the girl.<br> May the hand of God strike him.<br> Dance, you mud turtles, dance!<br> You rot our bodies,<br> steal hope from our souls.<br> Must you also<br> shame and defile our women?<br> Dance, you squealing goat!<br> We are not animals, we are men,<br> made in the image of God.<br> This will change your image.<br> Dance, you.<br> Get that straw cutter.<br> Leave him,<br> or you'll be murdered with him.<br> I'll not leave a man<br> to die in the mud.<br> Thank you, my son.<br> But death is better than bondage,<br> for my days are ended<br> and my prayer unanswered.<br> What prayer, old man?<br> That before death closed my eyes<br> I might behold the deliverer<br> who will lead all men to freedom.<br> What deliverer could<br> break the power of Pharaoh?<br> You, mud-carriers,<br> throw this carrion to the vultures.<br> You, take his place.<br> And dance the straw<br> into the mud, you dogs.<br> Clear a path there!<br> Clear a path!<br> Stand aside, you. Make way.<br> Clear a path.<br> Come on, get back. Out of the way!<br> Keep your eyes on the ground.<br> I need another oarsman<br> for my barge, a strong slave.<br> - Your word is our will, great lady.<br> - The large one there.<br> - You, come up here.<br> - No, not that one.<br> The very dirty one there.<br> Yes, that one.<br> He may serve my purpose.<br> You!<br> You!

Guards!<br> You women take water to the roof.<br> Dathan, take charge. Guards, after him.<br> Pull it out of the shed.<br> Take it clear of the house.<br> No, no, your wings<br> must not be singed, my dove,<br> at least not by that fire.<br> - Joshua!<br> - Run, Lilia, run! The way is clear.<br> The master builder will not follow.<br> Neither will you, stonecutter.<br> Bind him between the columns.<br> See that his arms<br> are tightly stretched.<br> You will die on your feet, stonecutter.<br> He'll cut him to pieces.<br> Now, go after the girl!<br> - Don't come back without her.<br> - We'll find her.<br> You foolish, stupid man!<br> I would have kept her<br> only a short while.<br> She would have returned to you,<br> shall we say, more worthy.<br> Now, to whom shall I return Lilia?<br> You will not be there, Joshua.<br> You've seen me drive my chariot.<br> I can flick a fly from my horse's ear<br> without breaking<br> the rhythm of his stride.<br> You've seen me use my whip.<br> You make no outcry, Joshua.<br> But you will.<br> You will cry for the mercy of death.<br> One day you will listen<br> to the cry of slaves.<br> This is not that day, Joshua.<br> You hold your tongue almost<br> as well as I hold my temper.<br> It's a pity to kill<br> so strong a stonecutter.<br> - Death will bring death, Baka.<br> - Who are you?<br> One who asks<br> what right you have to kill a slave.<br> The right of a master to kill you<br> or any slave.<br> - Then kill me, master butcher!<br> - Moses!<br> Why have you done this?<br> - Where is the girl, Lilia?<br> - Gone.<br> Why are you dressed as a slave?<br> Why does a prince of Egypt kill<br> the Pharaoh's master builder<br> to save a Hebrew?<br> I am Hebrew.<br> God of Abraham.<br> Four hundred years we've waited.<br> The Pharaoh's soldiers<br> won't wait so long.<br> The Almighty has heard our cries<br> from bondage.<br> You are the chosen one.<br> - I know nothing of your god.<br> - He knows you, Moses.<br> He has brought you to us.<br> You cannot turn your back upon us.<br> You will deliver us. The finger<br> of God points the way to you.<br> - Where was his body found?<br> - Buried in the sand, royal one.<br> This is Bakas knife.<br> But there was no wound on the body.<br> Baka was a powerful man. It would<br> take strong hands to break him.<br> The slave, Joshua, is a stonecutter.<br> Go find me this Joshua.<br> Joshua's strength didn't kill<br> the master builder.<br> Now speaks the rat<br> that would be my ears.<br> Too many ears tie a rat's tongue.<br> Go. All of you.<br> Well? Who killed him?<br> I am poor man, generous one.<br> What I bring is worth much.<br> I have paid you much<br> and you have brought me nothing.<br> Now I bring you the world...<br> true son of Pharaoh.<br> You offer me the world when you<br> cannot even bring me the deliverer.<br> Who killed Baka?<br> - The deliverer.<br> - Would you play at words with me?<br> No, lord prince.<br> This murderer has now fled<br> to some distant land?<br> No, lord prince.<br> Name him!<br> One who made himself<br> a prince and judge over us.<br> If he knew I were here, he would<br> kill me as he killed the Egyptian.<br> I will hang you myself<br> if you tire me further.<br> There are those who would pay much<br> for what my eyes have seen.<br> You haggle with me like a seller<br> of melons in the marketplace?<br> No, I will not haggle, great prince.<br> Here's your money.<br> But for ten talents of fine gold,<br> I'll give you the wealth of Egypt.<br> Give me my freedom<br> and I'll give you the scepter.<br> Give me the water girl, Lilia,<br> and I'll give you the princess<br> of your heart's desire.<br> Give me this house of Baka,<br> and I'll give you the throne.<br> Give me all that I ask...<br> ...or give me leave to go.<br> I will give you more than leave to go.<br> I will send you where you belong.<br> I belong in your service, glorious one.<br> Very well.<br> I will bargain with you.<br> If what you say pleases me,<br> I will give you your price, all of it.<br> If not, I will give you the point of<br> this blade through your lying throat.<br> - Agreed?<br> - Agreed.<br> The deliverer...<br> ...is Moses.<br> Draw one more breath to tell me<br> why Moses or any other Egyptian<br> would deliver the Hebrews.<br> Moses is not Egyptian.<br> He's Hebrew.<br> The son of slaves.<br> I will pay your price.<br> Imagine poor Nefretiri,<br> not knowing in which bed<br> she will sleep.<br> - I'd be happy in either.<br> - But where is Prince Moses?<br> No Moses, no jubilee.<br> I am told, my tiger lily,<br> they're wagering against me.<br> Two golden debens to one.<br> Yes. I wagered five myself!<br> You'll lose your debens if Moses<br> keeps me waiting any longer.<br> I double the wager. I'll watch<br> for Moses, you watch the dance!<br> While you wait to honor Moses,<br> I will honor Sethi's jubilee...<br> ...with a gift.<br> Strange gift.<br> You said if the deliverer were a myth,<br> -to bring him in a bottle.<br> - The bottle is empty.<br> Yes. It is empty<br> because he is not a myth.<br> - You have found such a man?<br> - Yes, my father.<br> I have found him in the midst<br> of treachery and treason,<br> with the blood of your<br> master builder red upon his hands.<br> Shall I summon him<br> to Pharaoh's justice?<br> Summon him!<br> - Bring the Hebrew in.<br> - Bring the Hebrew in.<br> Moses.<br> Great Pharaoh...<br> ...I stand in the shadow<br> of your justice.<br> Whose work is this?<br> I warned you of his treason, my father.<br> - Treason?<br> - Judge now if I spoke truly.<br> The evil star foretold him<br> as the destroyer of Egypt<br> and deliverer of slaves.<br> It is not possible. A prince of Egypt?<br> He is not a prince of Egypt.<br> He is not the son of your sister.<br> He is the son of Hebrew slaves.<br> Speak... my son.<br> I am the son of Amram and Yochabel.<br> Hebrew slaves.<br> My brother, it was I<br> who deceived you, not Moses.<br> - He was only a child.<br> - Leave me.<br> I shall not see your face again.<br> Moses, come to me.<br> I do not care who you are or what you<br> are or what they may say about you,<br> but I want to hear from your own lips<br> that you are not a traitor,<br> that you would not lead these people<br> in revolt against me.<br> Tell me, Moses. I will believe you.<br> I am not this deliverer you fear.<br> It would take more than a man<br> to lead the slaves from bondage.<br> It would take a god.<br> But if I could free them,<br> I would.<br> What has turned you against me?<br> From the time my sister brought you<br> to the court, I loved you,<br> reared you, set you before my own son,<br> because I saw in you<br> a worth and a greatness<br> above other men.<br> No son could have<br> more love for you than I.<br> Then why are you forcing me<br> to destroy you?<br> What evil has done this to you?<br> The evil that men should turn their<br> brothers into beasts of burden,<br> to slave and suffer in dumb anguish,<br> to be stripped of spirit<br> and hope and faith,<br> only because they're<br> of another race,<br> another creed.<br> If there is a God,<br> he did not mean this to be so.<br> What I have done,<br> I was compelled to do.<br> So be it.<br> What I do now,<br> I am compelled to do.<br> No! No!<br> Rameses,<br> Egypt shall be yours.<br> Hear what I say, Rameses.<br> When I cross the river of death,<br> you will be Pharaoh in Egypt.<br> Harden yourself against subordinates.<br> Put no faith in a brother.<br> Have no friend.<br> Trust no woman.<br> I protected the helpless,<br> I nourished the orphan.<br> Great one!<br> He who ate my bread<br> and called me father<br> would make rebellion against me.<br> What manner of death<br> do you decree for him?<br> I cannot speak it.<br> Let it be as you will.<br> I will not live if you must die!<br> The feet of a Hebrew slave<br> is not the right place<br> for the next queen of Egypt.<br> Take him away.<br> - Do not look upon him.<br> - Traitor to Pharaoh.<br> Let the name of Moses<br> be stricken<br> from every book and tablet.<br> Stricken from all pylons and obelisks.<br> Stricken from every monument of Egypt.<br> Let the name of... Moses...<br> ...be unheard and unspoken,<br> erased from the memory of men<br> for all time.<br> No, Moses.<br> It is I who will possess all of her.<br> You think when you are in my arms it<br> will be his face you will see, not mine?<br> Yes. Only his face.<br> I defeated you in life.<br> You shall not defeat me by your death.<br> The dead are not scorched<br> in the desert of desire.<br> They do not suffer<br> from the thirst of passion<br> or stagger blindly towards<br> some mirage of lost love.<br> But you, Hebrew,<br> will suffer all these things...<br> - ...by living.<br> - You will let him live!<br> I will not make him a martyr<br> for you to cherish.<br> No phantom will come between<br> you and me in the night.<br> Yes, my sweet. I will let him live.<br> Dead...<br> ...you alone would possess him.<br> From where I send him<br> there is no returning.<br> And you will never know<br> if he has found forgetfulness<br> within another woman's arms.<br> Now, look upon each other<br> for the last time.<br> Now, look for the first time,<br> Abiram, upon the governor of Goshen.<br> Dathan, my brother,<br> you have the favor of the Lord.<br> I prefer the gratitude of the prince.<br> Nearer.<br> Yes. Very lovely.<br> Not that purplish flower.<br> The purity of white<br> will cool the blush of your cheek.<br> Leave us. All of you.<br> Yes, you, too, my brother.<br> Continue your playing,<br> but in the house.<br> Yes. That's better.<br> A flower behind a flower.<br> Dathan, if you fear God, let me go.<br> I'm here, girl, because I put no trust<br> in a desert god<br> and his mud-pit prophet.<br> I prospered because I bowed lower than<br> my brothers before the Egyptians.<br> Now, the Egyptians bow low before me.<br> Joshua wanted you.<br> Baka wanted you.<br> But you belong to me.<br> A gift from Rameses to His Excellency.<br> I will bow before you, Dathan.<br> I will work my hands raw for you.<br> But please...<br> Please do not shame me<br> before my Lord.<br> Your Lord is the governor of Goshen.<br> What difference to my shame?<br> No difference to you,<br> my dove of Canaan.<br> But to a condemned slave like Joshua,<br> it could make the difference<br> between death on the spikes<br> and life in the copper mines of Sinai.<br> What would you do to influence<br> His Excellency's clemency?<br> Anything, Dathan.<br> Anything.<br> Joshua will always<br> be grateful to you,<br> my little mud flower.<br> His fate is better<br> than the one that waits for Moses.<br> The slave who would be king.<br> Captain. Robe of state.<br> His Hebrew mother brought it<br> to the prison before she died.<br> I'd rather this for your armor.<br> You will have need of a scepter.<br> Give me this binding pole.<br> Here is your king's scepter<br> and here is your kingdom,<br> with the scorpion, the cobra<br> and the lizard for subjects.<br> Free them, if you will.<br> Leave the Hebrews to me.<br> Give this prince of Israel<br> one day's ration of bread and water.<br> One day's ration?<br> It will take many days to cross this<br> wilderness, if he can cross at all.<br> I commend you to your Hebrew god<br> who has no name.<br> If you die, it will be<br> by his hand, not by mine.<br> Farewell, my one-time brother.<br> Into the blistering wilderness of Shun<br> the man who walked with kings<br> now walks alone.<br> Torn from the pinnacle of royal power;<br> stripped of all rank and earthly wealth,<br> a forsaken man without a country,<br> without a hope.<br> His soul in turmoil,<br> like the hot winds and raging sands<br> that lash him with the fury<br> of a taskmaster's whip.<br> He is driven forward, always forward,<br> by a god unknown<br> toward a land unseen.<br> Into the molten wilderness of sin,<br> where granite sentinels<br> stand as towers of living death<br> to bar his way.<br> Each night brings<br> the black embrace of loneliness.<br> In the mocking whisper of the wind<br> he hears the echoing voices of the dark.<br> Moses!<br> - Moses!<br> - Moses!<br> His tortured mind<br> wondering if they call<br> the memory of past triumphs<br> or wail foreboding<br> of disasters yet to come<br> or whether the desert's hot breath<br> has melted his reason into madness.<br> He cannot cool the burning kiss<br> of thirst upon his lips,<br> nor shade the scorching fury of the sun.<br> All about is desolation.<br> He can neither bless nor curse<br> the power that moves him,<br> for he does not know<br> from where it comes.<br> Learning that it can be more<br> terrible to live than to die,<br> he is driven onward through<br> the burning crucible of desert,<br> where holy men and prophets<br> are cleansed and purged<br> for God's great purpose.<br> Until, at last,<br> at the end of human strength,<br> beaten into the dust<br> from which he came,<br> the metal is ready<br> for the Maker's hand.<br> And he found strength<br> from a fruit-laden palm tree<br> and life-giving water;<br> flowing from the well of Midian.<br> - If only sheep were men!<br> - Unmarried men!<br> - Can you think of nothing else?<br> - I don't know. I've never tried!<br> I wish sheep<br> could learn to water themselves.<br> You needn't have painted<br> your nails, Lulua.<br> There isn't a man<br> from here to Horeb.<br> - What do you see, Sephora?<br> - What are you looking at?<br> - A man.<br> - What?<br> A man?<br> What kind of a man?<br> - A young man?<br> - Only one?<br> Is he handsome?<br> - Look at his sandals!<br> - Egyptian!<br> - His robe is not Egyptian.<br> - Who cares? He's a man.<br> Yes!<br> - He's eaten a whole bunch of dates!<br> - Could he be dangerous?<br> - Are you sure he's alive?<br> - I hope so!<br> - Do you think he's married?<br> - Look. There's real trouble.<br> - Amalekites.<br> - Amalekites!<br> - I'll talk to them.<br> - Talk to them? Get stones!<br> - They'll scatter the flock!<br> - Desert thieves!<br> - We drew this water!<br> - Out of the way, girl!<br> This is the well of Jethro, our father.<br> You have no right here!<br> Our goats don't know your father!<br> - Jethro's mark is on the well.<br> - They can't read either.<br> Nor can we!<br> - He's the Sheik of Midian!<br> - Then let him breed sons<br> -to guard it, not daughters.<br> - Get your hands off her!<br> Drive them away!<br> Let them be first<br> whose hands have drawn the water.<br> The stranger is wise, and strong.<br> Drive back your goats<br> until the sheep are watered.<br> All right, all right.<br> We should draw water for you<br> and wash the desert dust from your feet.<br> - Of course we should!<br> - Here's fresh water.<br> - I have soap weed.<br> - Let me first remove his sandals!<br> Never did a lost sheep<br> have so many shepherds.<br> - We have no towel.<br> - My veil will serve.<br> - But I...<br> - Here, let me pour the water!<br> - Am I to be bathed or drowned?<br> - I'll hold it for you.<br> Is it true that Egyptian girls<br> paint their eyes?<br> Yes. But very few have eyes<br> as beautiful as yours.<br> And who...?<br> Who is the brave one who<br> stood against the Amalekites?<br> That's Sephora. She's the oldest.<br> Since you have already<br> divided the stranger among you,<br> I will ask a welcome for him<br> in our father's tent.<br> - Our father is Jethro.<br> - He's Sheik of Midian.<br> Strength to you, stranger.<br> I am Moses,<br> son of Amram and Yochabel.<br> Health, prosperity, life to you,<br> Jethro of Midian.<br> Sephora has told me of your kindness.<br> Let us break bread<br> while my daughter brings meat.<br> You have come far.<br> From Egypt.<br> Across the desert? On foot?<br> He who has no name<br> surely guided your steps.<br> No name? You Bedouins<br> know the god of Abraham?<br> Abraham is the father of many nations.<br> We are the children of Ishmael,<br> his first-born.<br> We are the obedient of God.<br> My people look to him for deliverance.<br> But they are still in bondage.<br> Tomorrow we leave for the high pastures<br> beneath God's holy mountain.<br> My tent would be favored<br> if you joined us.<br> I am a stranger in a strange land.<br> I have no wealth,<br> no skill as a shepherd.<br> And it is death to give<br> sanctuary to a runaway slave.<br> - Slave?<br> - Death?<br> Not among our people.<br> You have wisdom.<br> You need nothing more.<br> And there are seven here to teach you<br> the tasks of a shepherd.<br> Sephora is the eldest.<br> You can learn best from her.<br> I will dwell in this land.<br> - Today he sleeps.<br> - Who sleeps?<br> He who has no name.<br> Does your God live on this mountain?<br> Sinai is his high place. His temple.<br> If this god is God,<br> he would live on every mountain,<br> in every valley.<br> He would not be only the god<br> of Israel or of Ishmael alone,<br> but of all men.<br> It is said he created all men<br> in his image.<br> And he would dwell in every heart,<br> in every mind...<br> ...in every soul.<br> I do not know about such things.<br> But I do know that the mountain<br> rumbles when God is there.<br> And the earth trembles<br> and the cloud is red with fire.<br> At such a time,<br> has any man ever gone<br> to see him face to face?<br> No man has ever set foot<br> on the forbidden slopes of Sinai.<br> Why do you want to see him, Moses?<br> To know that he is.<br> And if he is, to know why<br> he has not heard the cries<br> of slaves in bondage.<br> Moses, it would be death<br> to look upon his face.<br> How many of my people have died<br> because he's turned away his face?<br> Can a man judge God?<br> No, Moses.<br> We cannot see his whole purpose.<br> Even Ishmael did not know that God<br> drove him into the desert<br> to be the father of a nation.<br> Is it not enough to know that he has<br> saved you from the Pharaoh's anger?<br> How do you know that?<br> You walk like a prince.<br> And you tight like a warrior.<br> There is word in the caravans<br> of a great one<br> who was driven out of Egypt.<br> This is not the scepter of a prince,<br> but the staff of a wanderer.<br> Then rest from wandering.<br> My father has many flocks,<br> and no son to tend them.<br> There would be peace of spirit<br> for you, Moses,<br> in our tents beneath the holy mountain.<br> You have strong faith in this God,<br> Sephora.<br> But, for me,<br> there is no peace of spirit<br> until I hear the word of God,<br> from God himself.<br> You haven't much time!<br> I wish every day<br> was a shearing festival!<br> I know. And all the men following you<br> like sheep to be sheared!<br> - One would be enough for me!<br> - If he were Moses!<br> Never before, my brothers,<br> has our wool brought so rich a payment.<br> Because Moses<br> has sold the whole shearing<br> of all the tribes in one piece,<br> at one price, to Lugal here.<br> His words are truth.<br> His trading is just.<br> Peace be with you, sheiks of Sinai.<br> Why are you dressed like that?<br> Aren't you going to dance with us<br> before the sheiks?<br> No, I am not going to dance<br> before the sheiks. Here.<br> And I am not going to be displayed<br> like a caravan's wares<br> before Moses or any other man.<br> Tonight I tend the sheep.<br> You needn't laugh.<br> Moses may not choose you either!<br> Moses shall no longer<br> be a stranger among us.<br> - We should give him of our flocks.<br> - And let him choose.<br> I shall give him choice<br> of my seven daughters for wife.<br> Seven to choose from.<br> - A strong son.<br> - A happy union.<br> The shadow of my wisdom has fled.<br> Can a man choose<br> from among the stars of the sky?<br> Consider them as they dance.<br> Cohath, strike your bow.<br> - A pleasant task.<br> - Indeed!<br> A bride, a shawl.<br> Choose one, not all.<br> One shawl, one wife.<br> Your choice for life.<br> Pearls of great price.<br> - Which, Moses?<br> - Which will it be?<br> Make your choice, Moses.<br> It is a garden of many flowers, Moses.<br> I wish you had my years<br> and I had your choice.<br> In the tent of Jethro<br> there is dignity, honor, freedom<br> and beauty.<br> All that a man could ask of life.<br> But my heart is still<br> a prisoner of the past.<br> I... I cannot choose now.<br> - Strength to you, sheiks of Sinai.<br> - May God guide your heart.<br> Moses!<br> Tonight he is awake.<br> Which of my sisters did you choose?<br> I made no choice, Sephora.<br> She was very beautiful, wasn't she?<br> This woman of Egypt<br> who left her scar upon your heart.<br> Her skin was white as curd.<br> Her eyes,<br> green as the cedars of Lebanon.<br> Her lips, tamarisk honey.<br> Like the breast of a dove,<br> her arms were soft.<br> And the wine of desire<br> was in her veins.<br> Yes. She was beautiful...<br> ...as a jewel.<br> A jewel has brilliant fire,<br> but gives no warmth.<br> Our hands are not so soft,<br> but they can serve.<br> Our bodies not so white,<br> but they are strong.<br> Our lips are not perfumed...<br> ...but they speak the truth.<br> Love is not an art to us.<br> It's life to us.<br> We are not dressed<br> in gold and fine linen.<br> Strength and honor are our clothing.<br> Our tents are not<br> the columned halls of Egypt,<br> but our children<br> play happily before them.<br> We can offer you little...<br> ...but we offer all we have.<br> I have not little, Sephora.<br> I have nothing.<br> Nothing from some<br> is more than gold from others.<br> You would fill<br> the emptiness of my heart?<br> I could never fill all of it, Moses.<br> But I shall not be jealous of a memory.<br> May the gods bless you<br> as you go to join them<br> in the land of the dead.<br> The old windbag.<br> What an infernal fuss.<br> After all,<br> dying is only a part of living.<br> You won't die, old crocodile.<br> You'll cheat death the way<br> you cheat me at hounds and jackals.<br> I'm afraid he won't let me cheat<br> the way you do.<br> You'll be Pharaoh by sunset, Rameses.<br> I hope you're content... at last.<br> I am content to be your son.<br> You have restored Egypt<br> to her greatness.<br> I shall make her greatness<br> feared among nations.<br> No doubt, no doubt.<br> You can overcome anything,<br> but your own arrogance.<br> Don't exhaust yourself, great one.<br> - Dear great one.<br> - Why not, kitten?<br> You are the only thing I regret leaving.<br> You have been my joy.<br> - And you, my only love.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Now you're cheating.<br> - There was another.<br> - Yes.<br> I know.<br> I loved him, too.<br> With my last breath,<br> I'll break my own law<br> and speak the name of...<br> ...Moses.<br> Moses.<br> The royal falcon<br> has flown into the sun.<br> Did the little boy die in the desert,<br> my father?<br> No. God brought Ishmael and<br> his mother, Hagar, into a good land.<br> The same God who lives<br> on the mountain?<br> - It may be, my son.<br> - Moses! Moses!<br> Your mother is calling.<br> Here!<br> Moses! There is a man among the sheep!<br> You stay...<br> You keep sounding the alarm, Gershom.<br> But stay here till your mother comes.<br> In the cleft, behind the rock.<br> Your eyes are sharp<br> as they are beautiful.<br> Turfa!<br> Khataf! Back!<br> Khataf! Back!<br> Back, Khataf. Come down!<br> Moses.<br> Down, Turfa!<br> Praise God I have found you!<br> Joshua?<br> We thought you dead.<br> In the copper mines of Geber,<br> the living are dead.<br> Sephora! Bring water.<br> How did you find me?<br> A merchant buying copper<br> saw you in the tent of Jethro.<br> Here, you too will find peace.<br> Peace?<br> How can you find peace or want it,<br> when Rameses builds cities mortared<br> with the blood of our people?<br> You must lead them out of Egypt!<br> God made a covenant with Abraham<br> that he would deliver the people.<br> Am I the hand of God?<br> - Sephora, give him water.<br> - Water! Bless you!<br> The desert sun has set fire to his mind.<br> His name is Joshua.<br> I once killed that he might live.<br> They told me you were condemned,<br> but I knew you were chosen to take<br> the sword of God into your hand!<br> I am not the man.<br> I am a shepherd with flocks...<br> That light on the mountainside...<br> Do you see that strange tire?<br> - A bush that burns?<br> - No.<br> It is on fire,<br> but the bush does not burn.<br> Sephora, take him.<br> Serve him food in our tent.<br> I will turn aside<br> and see this great sight.<br> Moses.<br> Moses.<br> I am here.<br> Put off thy shoes from off thy feet.<br> For the place whereon thou standest<br> is holy ground.<br> I am the God of thy father.<br> The God of Abraham,<br> the God of Isaac<br> and the God of Jacob.<br> Lord...<br> Lord, why do you not hear the cries<br> of their children<br> in the bondage of Egypt?<br> I have surely seen the affliction<br> of my people which are in Egypt.<br> And I have heard their cry<br> by reason of their taskmasters.<br> For I know their sorrows.<br> Therefore, I will send thee, Moses,<br> unto Pharaoh,<br> that thou mayest bring my people<br> out of Egypt.<br> Who am I, Lord,<br> that you should send me?<br> How can I lead this people<br> out of bondage?<br> What words can I speak<br> that they will heed?<br> I will teach thee what thou wilt say.<br> When thou hast brought forth<br> the people,<br> they shall serve me upon this mountain.<br> I will put my laws into their hearts.<br> And in their minds will I write them.<br> Now, therefore, go.<br> And I will be with thee.<br> But if I say to your children<br> that the God of their fathers<br> has sent me,<br> they will ask, "What is his name?"<br> And how shall I answer them?<br> I am that I am.<br> Thou shalt say,<br> "l am hath sent me unto you."<br> Is the holy mountain<br> forbidden to men?<br> Yes. And I am afraid for him.<br> Then he is more than man, for look...<br> Look at his face.<br> He has seen God.<br> Moses... your hair... your sandals.<br> I stood upon holy ground.<br> Can you tell us, Moses?<br> My eyes could not look upon him.<br> Did he speak?<br> He revealed his word to my mind.<br> And the word was God.<br> Did he speak as a man?<br> He is not flesh but spirit.<br> The light of eternal mind.<br> And I know that his light<br> is in every man.<br> Did he ask something of you?<br> That I go to Egypt.<br> You are God's messenger!<br> He has set the day of deliverance.<br> I will get water and bread<br> that we may leave at once.<br> But Egypt holds death for you.<br> If it be his will.<br> Where he sends you, I shall go.<br> Your God is my God.<br> I will lead men against the armory<br> at Migdol and get swords for the people!<br> It is not by the sword<br> that he will deliver his people,<br> but by the staff of a shepherd.<br> And the Lord said unto Moses,<br> "Go. Return into Egypt. "<br> And Moses took his wife and his son<br> and he returned to the land of Egypt.<br> And Moses took the rod of God<br> in his hand.<br> Let the ambassador from Priam,<br> king of Troy, approach the Pharaoh.<br> Great Pharaoh, the gift of Troy<br> is a fabulous fabric<br> from the land of the five rivers.<br> Our thanks to Priam.<br> It is fabulous indeed.<br> - It shimmers like the Nile.

Over the sea?<br> No, it comes from the desert.<br> That's the thunder of horses!<br> Look! Pharaoh's chariot!<br> We're trapped against the sea!<br> Caleb, warn the north tents!<br> Joshua?<br> That's Joshua's horn!<br> All men to the pass!<br> Get carts, wagons! Form a barrier!<br> - What's the alarm, Joshua?<br> - Pharaoh's chariot!<br> Block the pass with carts!<br> Women and children, to the sea!<br> - Bring shovels, pounders, mattocks!<br> - Hear me! Hear me!<br> Can mattocks stop arrows?<br> Will your little carts<br> stop Pharaoh's Chariots?<br> You women,<br> do you want to see your men killed?<br> - Moses!<br> - Joshua, what is it?<br> Pharaoh's chariots!<br> I've ordered men to block the pass!<br> - How can we fight chariots?<br> - Nothing can stop them!<br> Order the men to move back, Joshua.<br> Move back? Where? Into the sea?<br> Into the hand of God.<br> Deliverer?<br> Yes, he has delivered you to death!<br> Run! Run!<br> Look! Look!<br> Blame Moses for this!<br> Deliver him to Pharaoh!<br> Stone him! Stone him!<br> The god of Moses is a poor general,<br> to leave him no retreat.<br> Ten times you have seen<br> the miracles of the Lord!<br> And still you have no faith!<br> He's a false prophet<br> who delivers you to death!<br> Stone him! Stone him!<br> Listen to Moses!<br> He speaks God's will!<br> Forward!<br> - They will stop for me!<br> - A charging chariot knows no rank.<br> Was it because<br> there were no graves in Egypt<br> that you took us away<br> to die in the wilderness?<br> Why must we die?<br> Fear not!<br> Stand still,<br> and see the salvation of the Lord!<br> - A pillar of fire!<br> - It is the work of God!<br> Through it!<br> No, great one!<br> You cannot breach the fire of God!<br> Gather your families and your flocks.<br> We must go with all speed.<br> Go where? To drown in the sea?<br> How long will the fire<br> hold Pharaoh back?<br> - Will it hold?<br> - After this day,<br> you shall see his Chariots no more!<br> No! You'll be dead under them!<br> The Lord of Hosts<br> will do battle for us!<br> Behold his mighty hand!<br> The wind opens the sea!<br> God opens the sea<br> with the blast of his nostrils.<br> Lead them through<br> the midst of the waters.<br> His will be done!<br> He opens the waters before them,<br> and he bars our way with fire.<br> Let us go from this place.<br> Men cannot fight against a god!<br> Better to die in battle with a god,<br> than live in shame.<br> Praise God and down into it!<br> God has delivered us<br> from the son of Pharaohs.<br> Jacob cherished<br> His son Joseph<br> Many colors was his coat<br> - Help us!<br> - Never mind the wheel!<br> Pull! Pull for your lives!<br> Is your life worth so much?<br> Jacob cherished<br> His son Joseph<br> Many colors was his coat<br> God of A 'Dram<br> Isaac, Jacob<br> Ever bless us with Thy hand<br> Get tow-lines on the midwife's cart!<br> Save the bread if you can!<br> Ben Caleb! Order all wagons<br> to turn clear!<br> Moses! Stand on the rock where<br> the people can see you and have hope!<br> Above us!<br> Help that wagon!<br> The fire dies!<br> Sound the pursuit!<br> Chariots, halt!<br> This is work for a butcher,<br> not a Pharaoh.<br> Destroy them all.<br> But bring Moses to me alive.<br> Level spears! Forward!<br> - Here! Take him!<br> - Wait for me! Wait for me!<br> Grandfather, look,<br> the horses are coming!<br> The chariots! Run! Run!<br> Run for your lives!<br> Better to serve the Egyptians<br> than to die here!<br> Who shall withstand the power of God?<br> Thou didst blow with Thy winds,<br> and the sea covered them!<br> Who is like unto Thee, O Lord?<br> From everlasting to everlasting,<br> Thou art God!<br> The Lord is one! The Lord is one!<br> Before you strike,<br> show me his blood on your sword.<br> You couldn't even kill him.<br> His god... is God.<br> And Moses led Israel<br> from the Red Sea<br> into the wilderness of Sinai.<br> And they camped<br> before the holy mountain.<br> And when the people saw<br> that Moses delayed<br> to come down out of the mountain,<br> they gathered themselves together.<br> Ask Aaron. Could anyone live on that<br> fiery summit for 40 days and 40 nights?<br> - Yes! By the will of God!<br> - Who knows the will of God?<br> Do you? Do I?<br> Or you, Sephora? His grieving wife.<br> She came back among us<br> to find her husband.<br> But he's dead.<br> Even she cannot hope that he lives!<br> Moses went up into the forbidden<br> ground to receive God's law!<br> Yes, but he's not returned!<br> We share your pain. We sympathize.<br> But will sympathy lead us to this<br> land flowing with milk and honey?<br> - Now, we have no leader!<br> - Don't be fooled!<br> Moses will return!<br> Would a God<br> who's shown you such wonders<br> let Moses die<br> before his work is done?<br> - His work is done.<br> - His mother!<br> So beautiful is the hope of a mother!<br> But there are other mothers among you!<br> What will become of your children?<br> - We must have faith!<br> - Faith in what? You, Aaron?<br> Can you lead us to this land of promise?<br> Do you know where it is?<br> - Tell us!<br> - Where is it?<br> Across the wilderness!<br> - Then who is to lead us?<br> - You, Dathan!<br> Where could I bring you,<br> except to Egypt?<br> - Where there is death?<br> - No! Where there is food!<br> - Pharaoh would kill us all.<br> - Not if a god of Egypt went before us!<br> - You could make one for us, Aaron.<br> - No.<br> - Aaron knows the art of the temple!<br> I will not!<br> He will not!<br> He would rather see our flesh rot<br> in the wilderness.<br> You will make a god for us!<br> A god of gold! A golden calf!<br> Korah shall be the high priest!<br> Bring baskets! Buckets! Shawls!<br> Anything you have!<br> Break off your earrings,<br> your bracelets, your necklaces!<br> We will make of them a golden calf!<br> - The golden spoils we took from Egypt!<br> - There!<br> Spoils of Egypt!<br> From the burning bush, O Lord,<br> you charged me to bring the people<br> to this holy mountain,<br> to behold your glory<br> and receive your law.<br> What have I left undone?<br> Lam...<br> lam...<br> I am the Lord thy God.<br> Thou shalt have<br> no other gods before me.<br> Thou shalt not make unto thee<br> any graven image.<br> And they overlaid the image<br> with pure gold.<br> And Aaron fashioned it<br> and smoothed it with the hammer;<br> ready to be graven<br> by cunning art and man's device.<br> And he fastened it with nails<br> that it should not move.<br> And he that smote the anvil<br> did beat the molten gold<br> into thin plates.<br> For they had gathered their treasure<br> into the midst of the furnace,<br> and did blow the fire upon it<br> to melt it.<br> And they adorned themselves<br> in rich apparel and costly array,<br> with veils of blue<br> and purple and scarlet,<br> and fine twined linen wrought in Egypt.<br> And the women tread grapes<br> from Midian into new wine.<br> Thou shall not take the name<br> of the Lord thy God in vain.<br> Remember the Sabbath day,<br> to keep it holy.<br> Honor thy father and thy mother:<br> Thou shalt not kill.<br> And the people sinned a great sin,<br> for they had made them a god of gold.<br> And they bore him upon their<br> shoulders and rejoiced,<br> saying, "This be our god, O Israel. "<br> Are you mourners of Moses<br> afraid to face the new god of gold?<br> They were as children<br> who had lost their faith.<br> They were perverse and crooked<br> and rebellious against God.<br> They did eat the bread of wickedness,<br> and drank the wine of violence,<br> and they did evil<br> in the eyes of the Lord.<br> And the people cried,<br> "The graven image hath brought us joy, <br> and they worshipped the golden calf<br> and sacrificed unto it.<br> Here is your sacrifice!<br> Make way!<br> Make way for the sacrifice!<br> Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br> Thou shalt not steal.<br> Thou shalt not bear false witness<br> against thy neighbor:<br> Thou shalt not covet anything<br> that is thy neighbor's.<br> Written with the finger of God.<br> Go! Get thee down,<br> for thy people<br> have corrupted themselves.<br> And the people rose up to play,<br> and did eat and drink.<br> They were as the children of fools<br> and cast off their clothes.<br> The wicked were like a troubled sea<br> whose waters cast up mire and dirt.<br> They sank from evil to evil<br> and were viler than the earth.<br> And there was rioting and drunkenness,<br> for they had become servants of sin.<br> There was manifest all manner of<br> ungodliness and works of the flesh.<br> Even adultery and lasciviousness,<br> uncleanness, idolatry and rioting,<br> vanity and wrath.<br> And they were filled<br> with iniquity and vile affections.<br> And Aaron knew<br> that he had brought them to shame.<br> Abiram! Korah!<br> Bind the sacrifice with cord!<br> Even unto the horns of the altar!<br> The light of God<br> shines from you, Moses.<br> Do not kneel to me, Joshua.<br> These tablets of stone...<br> The writing of God.<br> His Ten Commandments.<br> There is a noise of war in the camp.<br> It is not the noise of war.<br> It is the noise of song and revelry.<br> - Moses!<br> - Look!<br> Joshua!<br> Woe unto thee, O Israel.<br> You have sinned a great sin<br> in the sight of God!<br> You are not worthy<br> to receive these Ten Commandments.<br> Aaron!<br> We are gathered against you, Moses!<br> You take too much upon yourself!<br> We will not live by your commandments.<br> We are free!<br> There is no freedom without the law.<br> Whose law, Moses? Yours?<br> Did you carve those tablets<br> to become a prince over us?<br> Who is on the Lord's side,<br> - let him come to me!<br> -I am!<br> Moses!<br> - You have cursed us.<br> - Dathan and the people made me do it.<br> Joshua! Joshua!<br> He showed you no land flowing with milk<br> and honey! I show you a god of gold!<br> Come with me! Follow me!<br> Blasphemers! Idolaters!<br> For this you shall drink bitter waters!<br> God has set before you this day<br> his laws of life and good<br> and death and evil.<br> Those who will not live by the law...<br> ...shall die by the law!<br> And the Lord's anger<br> was kindled against Israel.<br> And to prove whether they<br> would keep his commandments or no,<br> he made them wander<br> in the wilderness 40 years,<br> until all the generation that had done<br> evil in the sight of the Lord<br> was consumed.<br> But Moses' eye was not dim,<br> nor his natural force abated.<br> And he went up from the plains<br> of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo,<br> and the Lord showed him all the land<br> that was beyond the river Jordan.<br> The Lord was angry with me<br> because I disobeyed him<br> by the waters of strife.<br> And he said unto me,<br> "Behold the new land with thine eyes.<br> For thou shalt not cross<br> over this river Jordan."<br> Then I shall stay.<br> I am called by the Lord, Sephora.<br> I go alone.<br> Look, Moses.<br> The people have come<br> to the river Jordan.<br> In the Ark, they carry<br> the law you brought them.<br> You taught them<br> not to live by bread alone.<br> You are God's torch,<br> that lights the way to freedom.<br> I love you.<br> Joshua...<br> Joshua,<br> I charge you and strengthen you,<br> for you shall go over Jordan<br> to lead the people.<br> As for me and my house,<br> we shall serve the Lord.<br> Mered, give me the books.<br> Eleazar, set these five books<br> in the Ark of the Covenant,<br> by the tablets<br> of the Ten Commandments,<br> which the Lord restored unto us.<br> Go.<br> Proclaim liberty<br> throughout all the lands,<br> unto all the inhabitants thereof.<br>
