G.Y.<br> Oh, there's David...<br> David?<br> Diana?<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello<br> - Science?<br> - Arts.<br> - English.<br> - French and Spanish.<br> What about you?<br> What are you?<br> - Cosmologist, I'm a cosmologist.<br> - What's that?<br> - It's a kind of religion for intelligent atheists.<br> - Intelligent atheists?<br> You're not religious, are you?<br> C. of E.<br> - Church of England.<br> - England, yes.<br> I suppose someone has to be.<br> So, what do cosmologists worship then?<br> What do we worship?<br> One single unifying equation that<br> explains everything in the universe.<br> - Really.<br> - Yes.<br> What's the equation?<br> That is the question.<br> And a very good question.<br> I'm not quite sure yet.<br> But I intend to find out.<br> Then why do you even stay at Oxford?<br> Because my finals exams are such a shambles that<br> the examiners they settled me in for a "Viva",<br> - And they told me that if I go up a second...<br> - What's a "Viva"?<br> A sort of, mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy.<br> - As an interview?<br> - An interrogation.<br> And I told them that if they<br> gave me a 2nd class degree<br> then I'd stay with them and<br> do my research at Oxford,<br> but if they gave me the 1st,<br> I needed to get into Cambridge, then<br> they would never have to see me again.<br> - They gave you the 1st.<br> - They gave me the 1st.<br> - Of course.<br> - This party is officially deceased.<br> Come on,<br> I've fixed you up a ride home.<br> Come on, Jane... Jane?<br> - Well, it was lovely to talk to you.<br> - Yes.<br> And... I hope you find your equation.<br> Yes... oh...<br> - Bye.<br> - G'bye.<br> - Stephen?<br> - Oh!<br> Good.<br> Well, then, here we are, a little<br> challenge for you all, as you embark<br> upon your separate doctoral journeys...<br> whatever they may be, Mr. Hawking.<br> Pass them down.<br> Something to separate the men<br> from the boys, the wheat from the chaff,<br> the mesons from the pi-mesons,<br> the quarks from the quacks.<br> Ten questions,<br> each more impregnable than the last.<br> Good luck, you'll need it.<br> Shall we say Friday at 3 o'clock?<br> This is going to hospitalize me.<br> All right! Row! Row! Row! Row!<br> Row it out, Brian!<br> Come on, Brian!<br> Row, Brian!<br> Come on! Row, Brian.<br> Straight on, Brian!<br> Can I get two more of those, please?<br> - And some change for phone, Sir.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Take her out, man.<br> - Jane.<br> You'll never guess who I<br> saw the other day... Caroline.<br> I think she was having a date,<br> she can have him, quite frankly.<br> What's the probability?<br> Reasonably low.<br> Uh... this is... this is Stephen.<br> - Do you play croquet?<br> - Croquet?<br> - Not recently.<br> - Sunday morning.<br> I'm actually busy Sunday mornings.<br> Oh... Him.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, come on, get up!<br> How many did you get?<br> - Morning, Brian.<br> - Good afternoon, Stephen.<br> How many of the possible<br> questions did you do?<br> Brian, I have no idea what you're<br> talking about.<br> How many of Sciama's<br> questions did you get, Stephen?<br> - None.<br> - You didn't get any?<br> - I was going to do them later.<br> - You haven't even looked at them.<br> No.<br> Stephen, are you aware that you've<br> voluntarily embarked on a PhD in physics?<br> At the most prestigious<br> college in England?<br> Yes.<br> Oh! Thought maybe you'd slept<br> through the induction or something.<br> These are by P which is Greek to me.<br> Brian?<br> - What?<br> - Can you whip on some Wagner?<br> Sod off!<br> - Come in, Stephen.<br> - Sorry.<br> Michael, that's so illegible I can't quite<br> decipher how wrong it is, I suspect enormously,<br> and Brian... that's just baffling.<br> - Have you even bothered to?<br> - Oh, sorry.<br> Train time tables.<br> It's certainly unacceptable,<br> these expired a month ago.<br> It's on the back,<br> I had a little accident.<br> I could only do nine.<br> Well... oh... thank God...<br> however...<br> Nine?<br> Come in.<br> Oh, Stephen, take a seat.<br> I wanted to talk to you about your subject.<br> We're all rather concerned<br> as to what it's going to be.<br> I can't decide.<br> Do you have any ideas?<br> No.<br> This is where J.J. Thomson discovered the<br> electron, and where Rutherford split the atom.<br> You know, one of the great rewards<br> of this job is one never knows<br> from where the next great leap forward<br> is going to come, or from whom.<br> Next Friday, I'm taking a few<br> graduates of merit to London,<br> to attend a talk by the<br> mathematician Roger Penrose.<br> You come along... if you're interested.<br> Oh, and close the door as you leave.<br> So, I gather you've never been to church?<br> - Once upon a time.<br> - Tempted to convert?<br> I have a slight problem with the whole<br> Celestial Dictator premise.<br> Now, what are you doing for lunch?<br> Ma makes a cracking roast.<br> So, Jane, what are you studying?<br> - Arts.<br> - Sprouts?<br> Thank you.<br> French and Spanish,<br> and hoping to do a PhD eventually.<br> Oh, one arm.<br> Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula.<br> Medieval poets...<br> What painters do you like?<br> - Well, I like Turner.<br> - Turner, really?<br> You know, I always feel that his paintings<br> look as if they've been left out in the rain.<br> And... William Blake.<br> - Jane, have some of my elderflower wine.<br> - Yes, yes, thank you.<br> Don't touch it,<br> don't touch it, Jane.<br> Thank you, Mother.<br> Stephen doesn't like<br> my homemade wine...Philistine.<br> I'm going to send you back<br> with a couple of bottles.<br> So, Stephen, you have come to<br> church with a good woman.<br> Are you feeling holier than thou?<br> Positively saintly...<br> thank you.<br> You haven't said why you<br> don't believe in God.<br> A physicist can't allow his calculations to be<br> muddled by a belief in a supernatural creator.<br> Sounds less of an argument against<br> God than against physicists.<br> Light or dark?<br> - Jane, light meat or dark?<br> - Light, please.<br> I'm inviting Jane to be my<br> partner for the May ball.<br> Really! Very impressive!<br> You'll have to dance, won't you, Stephen?<br> Make way for my mother's maid,<br> here we go.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - Should we dance?<br> - No.<br> No.<br> I don't, it's a phenomenon I'm very happy to<br> observe, but I can't possibly imagine participating.<br> I absolutely agree. I mean, who<br> would want to dance?<br> No, I'm serious,<br> I don't dance.<br> No dancing then.<br> Do you see how the men's shirt-fronts<br> and their bow ties how they glow<br> more than the womens' dresses?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do you know why?<br> - Why?<br> - Tide.<br> Washing powder.<br> The fluorescence in the washing<br> powder is caught by the UV light.<br> Why do you know that?<br> When stars are born and when they<br> die, they emit UV radiation.<br> So, if we could see the night<br> sky in ultraviolet light,<br> then almost all the<br> stars would disappear<br> and all that we would see are<br> these spectacular births and deaths.<br> - And I reckon it would look a little...<br> - Like that.<br> - So, why?<br> - Why what?<br> - Why Spanish medieval poetry?<br> - I suppose I like to time travel...<br> ...like you.<br> Are there any particular time periods<br> that you'd like to visit?<br> - The imagine it's the Twenties.<br> - The Roaring Twenties?<br> "Seek, then, No learning from starry men,<br> Who follow with the optic glass"<br> "The Whirling Ways of Stars that Pass."<br> Bravo!<br> "In the beginning was the heaven and the<br> earth, and the earth was without form,"<br> "and darkness was upon the face of the deep."<br> Would you dance with me?<br> The train now departing<br> from track number three is<br> the nine-fifteen service<br> to London and Kings Row.<br> Come on, Stephen.<br> Get a move on.<br> What's wrong with you, man?<br> Come up top.<br> A star, more than three<br> times the size of our sun...<br> ...ought to end its life, how?<br> With a collapse.<br> the gravitational forces of<br> the entire mass overcoming<br> the electromagnetic forces of individual atoms,<br> and so collapsing inwards.<br> If the star is massive enough,<br> it will continue this collapse,<br> creating a black hole,<br> where the warping of space-time<br> These are by P which is Greek to me.<br> is so great that nothing<br> can escape... not even light.<br> It gets... smaller... smaller.<br> The star, in fact, gets denser<br> as atoms, even subatomic<br> particles get literally crushed<br> into smaller and smaller space.<br> And at its end point what are we left with?<br> A space time singularity.<br> Space and time come to a stop.<br> I wonder what would happen if you applied Penrose's<br> theory about black holes to the entire universe?<br> If Einstein is right, or if general relativity is<br> correct, then the universe is expanding, yes?<br> Yes?<br> - Yes.<br> - Okay, so...<br> If you reverse time,<br> then the universe is getting smaller.<br> - All right.<br> - So...<br> What if I reverse the process all the way back to see<br> what happened at the beginning of Time itself?<br> - The beginning of Time itself?<br> - Yes.<br> The universe, getting smaller and smaller,<br> getting denser and denser, hotter and hotter as...<br> As you wind back the clock.<br> - In fact, you wind back the clock.<br> - Wind back the clock.<br> Is that what you're doing?<br> You're winding back the clock.<br> Exactly what I'm doing.<br> Well, keep winding!<br> You've got quite a way to go! Keep winding.<br> - I don't want to fall down.<br> - Well, you've got to go back to the beginning of time.<br> You've got to go again, so,<br> keep winding, keep winding!<br> Until you get...<br> A singularity<br> A space-time singularity, so the universe<br> born from a black hole exploding.<br> - Keep going.<br> - What do you mean, "Keep going", what...<br> before the universe began?<br> No, no, no, no!<br> Keep going, develop the mathematics!<br> Push it as hard as you can!<br> Push it, push it!<br> - As hard as you can.<br> - I am pushing as hard as I can.<br> What... I count 1... 1, 2... 1, 2...<br> All right, all right.<br> Fourth finger, fourth peg.<br> It's called motor neuron disease.<br> It's a progressive neurological disorder<br> that destroys the cells in the brain<br> that control essential muscle activity,<br> such as...<br> Speaking, walking, breathing, swallowing<br> The signals that muscles must receive<br> in order to move are disrupted.<br> The result is... gradual muscle decay,<br> wasting away.<br> Eventually, the ability to control<br> voluntary movement is... lost... entirely.<br> I'm afraid average life<br> expectancy is two years.<br> There's nothing I can do for you.<br> What about the brain?<br> The brain isn't affected,<br> you're thoughts won't change.<br> It's... just that...<br> Well, eventually,<br> no one will know what they are.<br> I'm ever so sorry.<br> Well, welcome to this week's<br> episode of "The Natural World",<br> where this week we explore the<br> BIZARRE hibernation patterns<br> of the rare Cambridge Physicist,<br> seen here in his remarkable plumage..."<br> So, how was it?<br> What did they say, how's your wrist?<br> I have a disease, Bri.<br> Is it venereal... Stephen?<br> I have motor neuron disease.<br> Sorry, I don't...<br> It's Lou Gehrig's disease,<br> he's a baseball player.<br> Sorry, I'm lagging behind<br> in my pioneering research into<br> skilled motor, baseball related diseases.<br> - I have two years to live.<br> - What?<br> It does sound odd when you<br> say it out loud, doesn't it?<br> Whatchya mean?<br> What are you doing?<br> What did... what did... what... what did<br> they say? Sorry, I... I don't really...<br> Will you go, Brian?<br> Stephen, I was just being a berk...<br> I didn't... I'm so... I'll be...<br> You go.<br> Stephen, phone for you.<br> It's a girl.<br> - I'll see you soon.<br> - Yes.<br> She's waiting.<br> Stephen?<br> - Jane!<br> - Brian.<br> I'm sorry... I'm...<br> Why don't you sit down.<br> I'm so sorry, I understand you saw Stephen.<br> You know he was in hospital...<br> Something educational?<br> Very.<br> John is having an affair with Martha,<br> but Martha is in love with Alan, and I think<br> that Alan is probably homosexual, by the look of<br> his jumper, so, well, I'm just trying to work out<br> the mathematical probability of happiness.<br> Are you close?<br> It's some integer of zero,<br> but, no, I'm not quite there yet.<br> - Stephen.<br> - You just missed him.<br> He was here earlier.<br> Don't do this.<br> Go!<br> Okay.<br> Play a game with me.<br> Go!<br> If you don't get up<br> and play a game with me...<br> I won't come back here again...<br> ...ever.<br> Come on!<br> You can leave me now.<br> Are you going to talk<br> about this or not?<br> - Will you please just go?<br> - Is that what you want?<br> Yes, it is what I want, so, please, if you<br> care about me all, then, please, just go!<br> - I can't.<br> - I have two years to live.<br> - I need to work.<br> - I love you.<br> You've... you've leapt to...<br> that's a false conclusion...<br> I want us to be together,<br> for as long as we've got, and if that's<br> not very long then, well,<br> that's just how it is... it'll have to do.<br> You don't know what's coming.<br> It'll affect everything.<br> You glasses are always dirty.<br> There.<br> That's better, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, it is.<br> ...the solutions to the Schrodinger equation must<br> vanish at the boundary of the box, so we have...<br> Time!<br> Time, that's your subject?<br> Any aspect in particular?<br> Time.<br> Come in, come in.<br> I don't think you realize<br> what lies ahead, Jane.<br> His life is going to be very short.<br> So, be careful, the weight<br> of science is against you.<br> And this will not be a fight, Jane.<br> This is going to be a<br> very heavy defeat...<br> ...for all of us.<br> I know what you all think... that...<br> That I don't look a<br> terribly strong person.<br> But I love him.<br> And he loves me.<br> We're going to fight this<br> illness together...<br> ...all of us.<br> Good luck.<br> - Good morning, Stephen.<br> - Good morning, Rev.<br> I know, I know...<br> - ...got to be a little more elegant.<br> - Yes, that's what...<br> I understand, Mr. Munchner.<br> Come in, Stephen.<br> I know it's something we're<br> all worried about... condition.<br> You had some<br> reservations about it...<br> Well, well, we'll see.<br> - Welcome, Stephen.<br> - Morning.<br> - Would you like to take a seat?<br> - No, I'm fine, thank you.<br> - You're sure?<br> - Yeah.<br> So, so you...<br> in summary<br> As you know,<br> chapter one full of holes.<br> Lacks mathematical support.<br> - Professor Thorne.<br> - Chapter Two, now, really original.<br> Uses a lot of Roger's ideas.<br> Well, at least you run with them.<br> Chapter three, too many<br> unanswered questions.<br> I agree.<br> And then, of course, we have chapter four,<br> this black hole at the beginning of time.<br> - Space-time singularity?<br> - Indeed.<br> It's brilliant!<br> Brilliant.<br> Superb!<br> And therefore, all that remains<br> to be said is: Well done!<br> Or perhaps, I should say,<br> to be more precise:<br> - Well done, DOCTOR!<br> - Bravo, Stephen.<br> An extraordinary theory.<br> Thank you.<br> - So what next?<br> - Prove it.<br> To prove, with a single equation,<br> that time had a beginning.<br> Wouldn't that be nice, Professor?<br> With one simple elegant equation<br> to explain everything.?<br> Yes, it would.<br> It would indeed.<br> The esteemed, and formidable...<br> - Doctor.<br> - Who?<br> Doctor Stephen Hawking.<br> To Stephen Hawking.<br> Thank you, Jane.<br> It is astonishing that he's the first person to receive<br> his doctorate fearing what little work he's be doing.<br> "Work" was the worst four-letter<br> word for Stephen. Even at Oxford,<br> especially, he averaged an hour,<br> an HOUR a day he averaged.<br> And how many of your letters have<br> I covered in the last six months?<br> When you've been doing research trips...<br> - How many?<br> - Four.<br> - Everything all right?<br> - I'm good... I'm fine.<br> Tell Brian.<br> Of course.<br> Well, it's convenient for breakfast!<br> Thank you.<br> Sorry, did you say something?<br> I said...<br> Yes?<br> Thank you.<br> Look at you!<br> Go, Jane.<br> I'll be one second.<br> Luce, Baby.<br> Jane.<br> Stephen<br> Dear?<br> I've got an idea.<br> I said I've had an idea.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi, Dennis<br> - Hello, Dennis.<br> - Hi.<br> Okay, I love you.<br> He'll be fine, he'll be fine.<br> - Sorry.<br> - No problem.<br> ...allowing us to predict that SOME<br> particles CAN in fact ESCAPE a black hole.<br> The BLACK holes are NOT,<br> in fact, BLACK at all,<br> but GLOW with heat radiation.<br> ...the steady emission of heat energy<br> causes the black holes to LOSE mass,<br> and EVENTUALLY they DISAPPEAR<br> in a SPECTACULAR explosion.<br> It's very, very simple,<br> when a hot body loses heat...<br> Second law of thermodynamics.<br> - He's right, it's thermodynamics.<br> - In... in...<br> If we can imagine that<br> the black hole is, indeed,<br> losing particles, then, over time it<br> will diminish in size, it will evaporate.<br> - It will...<br> - Disappear.<br> So...<br> First a star vanishes into a black hole,<br> but THEN the black hole itself must...<br> Gone! Nothing!<br> - From nothing to nothing.<br> - You owe me another beer.<br> I have to show you that our friend has<br> PROVEN that time, indeed has a beginning.<br> NOT only that, how the universe<br> was BORN, AND how it will end.<br> - Bang!<br> - Crunch!<br> It's beautiful! It's racy!<br> Complete nonsense.<br> It's preposterous.<br> Was it something I said, Professor?<br> Excuse me.<br> My name...<br> My name is Professor Khalatnikov.<br> from Soviet Academy of Sciences.<br> As you know, my field is<br> evolution of the hot universe,<br> the properties of the microwave<br> background radiation,<br> and theory of the black holes.<br> To be honest...<br> I came here today...<br> ...expecting to hear a lot of nonsense.<br> I go home disappointed.<br> The little one here...<br> has done it.<br> He has done it!<br> - It has been a pleasure to meet you, Professor.<br> - Likewise, likewise.<br> That went pretty well.<br> It's probably for awhile.<br> Hawking radiation! The little one has<br> done it! The little one has done it!<br> - Come on, Genius!<br> - Oh, very funny!<br> You've had enough of that, Old Man.<br> Come on, codger.<br> God! How does Jane manage?<br> Stephen, your Motor "Mouth"<br> Disease, does it effect...<br> What?<br> Everything?<br> Different system... automatic.<br> You serious?<br> Well, that's a bit wonderful, isn't it?<br> Well, it certainly explains a lot about men.<br> Hurry up!<br> Come on!<br> - What's in there?<br> - It's a surprise!<br> Keep them closed.<br> - Ta-da!<br> - Ta-da!<br> Look, Daddy, look!<br> That is an electric wheelchair.<br> If you don't like it, we can take it back.<br> I don't understand... you've spent years<br> assuming black holes exist, and<br> you believe Cygnus X-1<br> could well turn out to be<br> the first black hole that we<br> can actually observe, and<br> yet you bet Kip Thorne<br> it's not a black hole?<br> - Yes.<br> - What did you bet him?<br> A one year's subscription to a magazine.<br> - Which magazine? Nature?<br> - No! Penthouse!<br> - Penthouse?<br> - Yes.<br> Gonna get you!<br> Daddy! Come up!<br> You need to hurry!<br> Mummy! Muumy!<br> Come and look!<br> I'm gonna get you!<br> All that day! All that day!<br> All that day! All that day!<br> - Hello!<br> - Hello!<br> - Hello!<br> - There you are!<br> Hello, Bush.<br> - Stephen!<br> - Hello.<br> Here we are!<br> Yes, here we go.<br> And once we're up at the top,<br> it's very snug... hello, Stephen.<br> Here we go.<br> - We'll turn you around, Stephen.<br> - You want me to push?<br> No, no, I'll be fine, you get the luggage.<br> Here we go, off, we got it.<br> There we are, you see.<br> Quite easy.<br> One, there we go.<br> Um... the... rain coming down,<br> shivering, cold, no, uh...<br> The... falling... falling... um...<br> - Very cold.<br> - What is it?<br> I can... I'm having a...<br> Is it out?<br> - Some... some water?<br> - No, don't worry.<br> You're okay.<br> That's it.<br> There we go.<br> It's okay. It's okay.<br> He needs to see a specialist.<br> It keeps happening over and over again.<br> - No doctors. No doctors!<br> - All right, no doctors.<br> A little water.<br> Stephen?<br> I need help.<br> If only for Robert, it...<br> he's missing out on his childhood<br> I keep looking for a way to make this work,<br> but I can't find it on my own.<br> Everything is fine,<br> we're just a normal family.<br> We're<br> not a normal family.<br> WE'RE NOT A NORMAL FAMILY!<br> Robert, your mother is VERY angry with me.<br> Thanks.<br> Jane?<br> Jane! Stop!<br> Sit!<br> Now...<br> I'd like to make a suggestion.<br> It might sound unusual,<br> but I have seen it work wonders.<br> I think that you should consider<br> joining the church choir.<br> Mum...<br> I think that's possibly the most<br> English thing anyone has ever said.<br> Maybe so.<br> - I used to love singing.<br> - You're very good at it.<br> - I don't know about that.<br> - Just go.<br> It's one hour a week.<br> Really lovely, everyone.<br> Okay, see you next week.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Have you come to sing.<br> - Um... I just came to...<br> - Soprano?<br> - Mezzo.<br> Ah! Lovely! Just what we need.<br> - Where have you been hiding?<br> - A good question.<br> Well, you're here now and just in time.<br> As they say.<br> - Ya know, I have to come back anyway.<br> - Great.<br> - Do you have everything?<br> - Yes, thank you, yes.<br> Thank you for coming,<br> you will be a... a valuable asset.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, I should... I should be going.<br> And... uh... if your son wants<br> those piano lessons, just...<br> Yes, yes, absolutely,<br> I... um...<br> - I will do.<br> - Great.<br> - My... my husband... adores music, too.<br> - Oh! Well! Does he play?<br> I could... I could teach him as well<br> That's a long story.<br> But, um...<br> Ah, okay.<br> - Well, thank you, Jonathan<br> - My pleasure, Jane, see you again.<br> - Bye bye.<br> - Bye bye.<br> Wine?<br> Why not, thank you.<br> - Stephen?<br> - Yes.<br> Stephen, Jane was telling me<br> you have a beautiful theorem...<br> ...that... that proves<br> the universe had a beginning?<br> That was my PhD thesis.<br> My new project DISPROVES it.<br> DISPROVES it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Oh!<br> So, then, you no longer<br> believe in the Creation?<br> What one believes is irrelevant...<br> - ...irrelevant in physics.<br> - Oh!<br> I see.<br> Stephen's done a U-turn.<br> The big new idea is that the<br> universe has no boundaries at all.<br> No boundaries, no beginning...<br> ...and no God.<br> Oh!<br> Oh, I see... I...<br> I thought that...<br> you'd proved the universe had a beginning<br> and thus a need for a Creator.<br> - My mistake.<br> - No... mine.<br> Stephen is looking for a single theory that<br> explains all the forces in the universe.<br> Therefore, God must die.<br> Why must God die, I don't see.<br> The two great pillars of physics are:<br> Quantum Theory,<br> the laws that govern the very small particles,<br> electrons and so on, and General Relativity.<br> Ah, yes, Einstein.<br> Einstein's theory,<br> the law that governs the very large,<br> planets and such, but Quantum, and Relativity...<br> Don't tell me...<br> they're different?<br> They don't remotely<br> play by the same rules.<br> If the world were all potatoes, then, easy,<br> you could trace a precise beginning,<br> as Stephen once did,<br> a moment of Creation.<br> Hallelujah, God lives.<br> If you incorporate peas<br> into the menu, then it all goes a little...<br> ...tits up.<br> Yes, haywire.<br> - It all becomes a Godless mess.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> Einstein hated peas.<br> Quantum Theory, he said,<br> "God doesn't play dice with the universe."<br> Seems he not only plays the dice,<br> but he throws them where<br> we can't find them.<br> God is back on the<br> endangered species list.<br> Well, I expect He'll cope.<br> But physics is back in business.<br> Yes, physics is back in business.<br> I was married... actually.<br> But suddenly... she passed.<br> Almost a year ago now.<br> It was leukemia.<br> She fought it and I nursed her,<br> but in the end...<br> I do get quite lonely...<br> the tyranny of the empty room.<br> And all that.<br> BUT... music is my salvation...<br> teaching and playing.<br> Not really as a career,<br> but I... I'm not that ambitious, so...<br> Is that a sin?<br> I don't know.<br> Wrong man to ask.<br> - Thank you so much for having me.<br> - Thank you for coming.<br> It was re... really... really wonderful.<br> If there's anything I<br> can do to be of service... to you.<br> To the family, I mean.<br> I would... consider it a privilege.<br> I have children, all commitant.<br> I only mean that if I...<br> could be of help, I've... I'm...<br> really, if I might find a purpose that<br> would help alleviate my own situation.<br> - Good night.<br> - Night.<br> I understand...<br> If you need help...<br> If someone is prepared to offer...<br> I won't object.<br> Calls you one and calls you all,<br> to gain his everlasting hall.<br> Christ was born to save.<br> Christ was born to save.<br> Great! Lovely!<br> Okay! We can go!<br> - Just going on seven twenty-five.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm... could... could you<br> all leave a copy of that?<br> There's something I need to tell you.<br> What?<br> I'm pregnant.<br> Gosh! I... I, um... I assumed<br> that you and Stephen...<br> Well, that's... that's really wonderful.<br> - It is.<br> - Yes, it's wonderful.<br> - Congratulations, Jane.<br> - Thank you.<br> Everyone say "cheese"! Ready? Count 3!<br> CHEESE!<br> - Mummy!<br> - Just coming.<br> Now, you know...<br> I've always been supportive of your<br> choice not to have home help, but<br> we need to find a permanent solution.<br> This... this...<br> situation cannot continue, you NEED to<br> have a PROPER LIVE-IN nurse immediately.<br> We have help.<br> Look... you know what I'm talking about.<br> We can't afford a live-in nurse.<br> Stephen, you need to find a way, for your<br> family's sake... you're world famous.<br> For black holes, not for rock concerts.<br> Stephen, this isn't funny,<br> I believe it's urgent.<br> We DO have a right to know.<br> We have a right to know, Jane.<br> Know what?<br> Whose child Timothy is...<br> Stephen's, or Jonathan's?<br> That's what you think of me?<br> There is no way that Timothy could<br> have any other father than Stephen.<br> Enough!<br> - Jonathan, please don't go.<br> - I have to go.<br> - Everybody's talking, and...<br> - So, what does it matter?<br> It's difficult for me because<br> I'm just trying to help.<br> I know you're trying to help<br> and your help is valueless.<br> The best thing for me right thing right now,<br> I think, maybe if... if... if...<br> ...I just step back for now.<br> Please, Jonathan, we need you, the children<br> need you, and I need you, and Stephen needs you.<br> Don't think of it.<br> But there's other things as well.<br> Jane, I...<br> I have feelings for you.<br> And I have feelings for you, too.<br> Thank you, Jane.<br> I've been invited to Bordeaux.<br> - Invited where?<br> - To Bordeaux.<br> To Bordeaux?<br> Mark and them?<br> Students can take me,<br> I know you hate flying.<br> I DO hate to fly.<br> Bring the car, meet me in Bordeaux.<br> Make the children comfy.<br> It'd be too difficult to manage, Stephen.<br> Bring Jonathan.<br> I doubt he would be willing.<br> Hello, Stephen.<br> - Is this okay?<br> - Well...<br> I won't tell if you won't.<br> Just...<br> ...bearing in mind you have to drive.<br> Jane needs help.<br> Sarah, you won't forget to give him the<br> injection as soon as soon as you land, will you.<br> And you'll call me when<br> you get to the hotel.<br> - I will.<br> -Yes? Promise?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Good!<br> Stephen?<br> Mum'll take the baby.<br> - She'll be here any minute.<br> - See you in Bordeaux.<br> You be good.<br> - They asleep?<br> - Yeah.<br> Jonathan.<br> Jonathan?<br> Jonathan, it's Stephen,<br> he's been just taken ill,<br> he's in the hospital right now,<br> he's in a coma.<br> What are you talking about?<br> This way would be a painless end.<br> If we try to bring him round from the anesthetic<br> it's not sure he will survive resuscitation.<br> You have to bring him<br> round from the anesthetic!<br> Are you sure it's what you want?<br> The only way of weaning him off the<br> ventilator would be to give him a tracheotomy,<br> a hole in the neck,<br> by-passing the throat.<br> He will never speak again.<br> There's no question... Stephen must live.<br> I will see he gets everything he needs.<br> I will have him transferred back to Cambridge.<br> - He may not survive the journey.<br> - Yes, he will.<br> I know.<br> I'll...<br> ...step back.<br> Did you get everything in the car...<br> his chair, and his equipment, and everything?<br> Goodbye.<br> This is a spelling board.<br> Firstly, you tell me what letter<br> you want by blinking when<br> I say the color of the group<br> that contains that letter.<br> Once I know the group, you can choose<br> the character INSIDE that group by<br> by blinking again when I say the color<br> of each letter WITHIN that group...<br> ...apparently<br> Let's just try.<br> Green.<br> Blue.<br> Pink.<br> Black.<br> Red.<br> Blink to choose the color of the group<br> of the letter that you want, Stephen.?<br> Green.<br> Blue.<br> Pink.<br> Black.<br> Red.<br> - Just wait here.<br> - Great.<br> She's here, she comes highly recommended.<br> Promise not to eat her alive.<br> Okay?<br> Here we are.<br> Elaine, Stephen.<br> Stephen, Elaine.<br> Lovely to meet you, Professor.<br> Now, you should have<br> everything you need.<br> But if there's anything else,<br> I'll be right next door.<br> Great, I think we'll get straight to work.<br> Thank you, Jane.<br> - Oh, if you just close the doors.<br> - Of course.<br> Let's get started then.<br> Okay...<br> Red.<br> Yellow.<br> T.<br> Green.<br> Black... "E".<br> Green, green, "A".<br> Tea.<br> You want a cup of tea?<br> Okay.<br> Any preference?<br> You've memorized the board, I know you have.<br> I haven't got all day.<br> Green, green,<br> green, yellow.<br> Yellow, "B".<br> Green, blue, black, pink, red.<br> Red?<br> Green, yellow, blue, blue.<br> "U"... should be Builder's Tea, right?<br> Well, how did he get on?<br> You know, I think he's the most<br> brilliant man I've ever met.<br> - You're very lucky.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You must worship the ground beneath...<br> - His wheels.<br> And he's a perfect patient,<br> he's so funny.<br> When you read about him people...<br> Let's see how he gets<br> on, shall we, Elaine?<br> That's quite enough.<br> As you can see, that it's quite adjustable,<br> and we can change the angle to<br> whatever speed wants you there.<br> - Ya know, it's cutting-edge.<br> - So, how does it work?<br> It uses a VERY simple<br> interface that scans through<br> the alphabet and selects<br> each letter one at a time.<br> I mean, using this technique,<br> the Professor can<br> expect to write at about<br> four words per minute.<br> Good! Better than one a minute.<br> Yes, and what I've done<br> is taken the components<br> from a telephone<br> answering system, actually,<br> to convert the written text<br> into synthesized speech.<br> I mean the voice sounds a<br> little bit robotic, but...<br> Shall we give it a try?<br> - Great!<br> - Here's the clicker.<br> Right hand?<br> There ya go.<br> Welcome to the future.<br> My name is Stephen Hawking.<br> It's American!<br> Is that a problem?<br> Oh, my goodness, well...<br> is there another voice?<br> It's the only one lately<br> I have at the moment.<br> I think it's great.<br> Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do.<br> "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."<br> Exterminate!<br> Exterminate!<br> Exterminate!<br> I will write a book.<br> About what?<br> - Time.<br> - Time.<br> What is the nature of time?<br> Will it ever come to an end?<br> Can we go back in time?<br> Some day these answers may seem as<br> obvious to us as the Earth orbiting the sun,<br> or perhaps as ridiculous<br> as a tower of tortoises.<br> Only time, that's what we say.<br> Professor?<br> - It is for a friend.<br> - Of course it is..<br> That's what they all say.<br> You don't have to be embarrassed<br> in front of me, Professor.<br> I know how men are like.<br> Shall we take a look?<br> There ya go.<br> Oh! I'm Sorry.<br> Next one.<br> What?<br> So I said I had long been looking for<br> a model of the universe.<br> I finally found her.<br> Stephen, I need to steal you,<br> the contracts arrived.<br> Could you just give us a minute, please, Jane?<br> There we go.<br> Like new.<br> Who are we?<br> Why are we here?<br> If ever learn this it would be the<br> ultimate triumph of the human reason,<br> for then we would<br> know the mind of God.<br> - Do you mean this?<br> - Yes.<br> - Of course.<br> - So, you're acknowledging Him?<br> However.<br> "However", what?<br> Are you actually going to<br> let me have this moment?<br> You're welcome.<br> I have asked Elaine to<br> travel with me to America.<br> She will look after me.<br> Will she?<br> Yes.<br> You always use to tell me<br> when an invitation came in.<br> Another award, what can you do?<br> I'm sorry.<br> How many years?<br> They said two.<br> You've had so many.<br> Everything will be okay.<br> I have loved you.<br> I did my best.<br> Careful!<br> - No, that stays.<br> - All right.<br> Goodbye, Jonathan.<br> Thank you.<br> I first met the Professor in 1963.<br> And there you are...<br> time, where did it go?<br> It has been one of the great<br> joys of my life to watch this man<br> defy every expectation,<br> both scientific and personal.<br> Please welcome onto the stage my<br> esteemed colleague,<br> my dear friend, Professor Hawking.<br> Thank you! Could we please have the<br> first preselected question, thank you.<br> Can you hear me?<br> Now you are recognized everywhere.<br> How do you deal with all the attention?<br> I was stopped recently<br> by a tourist at Cambridge<br> who asked if I was the<br> real Stephen Hawking.<br> I replied I was not, and said the<br> real one was much better looking.<br> In 1979, you talked about the possibility of a Theory of Everything.<br> being discovered before the end of the century.<br> I now predict that I was wrong.<br> Professor Hawking,<br> you have said you do not believe in God.<br> You have said you<br> did not believe in God.<br> Do you have a philosophy<br> of life that helps you?<br> It is clear that we are just<br> an advanced breed of primates,<br> on a minor planet orbiting<br> around a very average star,<br> in the outer suburb of one among<br> a hundred billion galaxies...<br> BUT, ever since the dawn of civilization,<br> people have craved for an understanding<br> of the underlying order of the world.<br> There ought to be something very special<br> about the boundary conditions of the universe.<br> And what can be more special<br> than that there is no boundary?<br> And there should be no<br> boundary to human endeavor.<br> We are all different.<br> However bad life may seem,<br> there is always something you<br> can do, and succeed at.<br> While there is life, there is hope.<br> It's from Stephen.<br> Gosh.<br> Your glasses are always dirty.<br> Professor and Missus Hawking,<br> Her Majesty the Queen.<br> Congratulations.<br> My "Companion of Honor"<br> Not bad for a<br> old, liberal socialist.<br> Don't worry, you can decline the knighthood.<br> Thank you for today.<br> It was extraordinary.<br> It's all been rather extraordinary,<br> though, hasn't it?<br> What are you writing?<br> Look what we made.<br>
