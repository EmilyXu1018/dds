You wouldn't go to her.<br> I didn't say I would,|but we've got to have money.<br> Did it ever occur to you|that Chris might work?<br> Now you've hurt his feelings.<br> You know, you have an Oedipus complex|and you won't admit it.<br> - Please, Gilbert.|- Your trouble is you won't face facts.<br> I know I have a mother fixation,|but it's slight.<br> - It hasn't yet reached the point of where...|- Stop it, Gilbert!<br> Don't mind what she says, Chris.<br> How can I help but mind?<br> I'm constantly humiliated|because I haven't money.<br> - I'll get some.|- You've said that for weeks.<br> Why don't you see Julia?|She handles his money.<br> All right.<br> - I couldn't go near that woman.|- I said all right.<br> - What are you going to do?|- Just what I said I'd do!<br> - You wouldn't do that.|- Wouldn't I?

But it's so pretty.<br> The Kirbys.<br> Is that another Christmas present?<br> - Did I give it to you?|- Yes.<br> I'm spoiling you.<br> Why, Nicky, this is from Clyde Wynant.<br> He says, "Will you take charge|of investigation on Julia Wolf's murder?<br> - "Communicate with Herbert MacCaulay."|- Let's see.<br> - Where's it from?|- Philadelphia. Well, then, he didn't do it.<br> I don't know.<br> He wouldn't ask you to handle it|if he were guilty, would he?<br> Your guess is as good as mine, baby.<br> Nicky, take the case.<br> You take it. I'm too busy.<br> - How do you do?|- Good morning.<br> I'm afraid this isn't a very|Merry Christmas for you.<br> - He's all right.|- Good.<br> - How are you, MacCaulay?|- I'm fine.<br> - Sit down.|- You're coming along better than me.<br> - I hope you're not seriously hurt.|- No, just a scratch.

Yes.<br> Thank you.<br> What are the chances|of getting you to do what he wants?<br> Slim.<br> Well, would it help|if I could persuade him to meet you?<br> It might.<br> He gave me a code message|to insert in the "Times"...<br> ...in case I wanted to reach him.<br> - I don't suppose it would do any harm.|- I've done that already.<br> He should appear, you know.<br> It doesn't look well,|his staying away at a time like this.<br> - Police.|- For me?<br> Where?<br> Allentown?<br> Yes.<br> When is the next train?<br> Right. I'll get that.<br> Wynant's tried to commit suicide.|They want me to go down and identify him.<br> I guess this changes the whole story,|doesn't it?<br> That looks like an admission of guilt.|And I had such hopes.<br> I thought if you got on the case|you could clear him.<br> I thought that Mimi, the way she acted,|I was sure that...<br> Oh, well.<br> There's no use thinking about that now.<br> I'm sorry to have wasted|so much of your time.<br> Good-bye. Have a Merry Christmas.<br> Thank you. Same to you.<br> - Bye-bye.|- Good-bye.<br> Asta, is your balloon busted?

About the gun?<br> That never was a gun.|Don't waste time talking about that.<br> Look here, man to man,|are you working on this case?<br> - Man to man, I'm not.|- But he's interested.<br> I'd rather have you working with us|than against us.<br> - That suits me.|- Then it's a bargain.<br> Anything you want to know?<br> - What about the suicide?|- That was a phony.<br> - The boys didn't even have to go down.|- I thought so.<br> Now they'll think every thin man|with white hair is Wynant.<br> - Do you think Wynant did it?|- I don't know.<br> He planned something.|He closed up his apartment and shop.<br> - Were you there?|- Yes, but I couldn't find a thing.<br> I figure it like this.<br> Wynant went to Julia's apartment|and found Morelli there.<br> Sees she's two-timing him, there's a fight.|He doesn't do anything because of Morelli.<br> Lets his lawyer give her money to give|to him so she thinks it's blown over.<br> Then when she isn't expecting it,|he let's her have it.<br> - No proof?|- Nothing as yet to cinch it.<br> - $50 will get you $100 that he didn't do it.|- What do you mean?<br> For one,|he's too absent-minded to hold a grudge.<br> - Who's your candidate?|- I haven't got that far.<br> Not everything points to Wynant.|How about your alibis?<br> They're all okay. Mrs. Jorgensen,|the boy, Dorothy, MacCaulay, even Morelli.<br> We had to let him go.<br> - What about Jorgensen?|- I'll check on that.<br> - Mrs. Charles, this must be dull for you.|- Dull? I'm sitting on the edge of my chair.<br> - What about Nunheim?|- He's all right.<br> We know all about him.|He does some stooling for us occasionally.<br> Did you know he's been|hanging around Julia?<br> No.<br> - He's holding out on you.|- Let's look into that.<br> Taxi!<br> This may get a bit rough.|I think you better let us go alone.<br> Catch me letting you go alone!<br> Grant's Tomb.<br> Taxi!<br> - Who is it?|- John.<br> Hello, Lieutenant.<br> Sit down, Nick.<br> I wasn't expecting you, Lieutenant.|You said you'd phone.<br> Have a shot?<br> What's the idea of telling me|you knew the Wolf girl just by sight?<br> That's all I did, Lieutenant.|That's the God's truth.<br> Maybe I said hello to her.<br> "How are you,"|or something when I saw her...<br> ...but that's all I did.

No!<br> He planned the whole thing beautifully.<br> After he killed Wynant,|he wired MacCaulay using Wynant's name...<br> ...and told him to close up the shop.|- Which I did.<br> Naturally.<br> Then he destroyed all of Wynant's clothes,|with the exception of his watch chain.<br> He figured that someday|that might come in handy.<br> Then he took Wynant's body|and buried it with another man's clothes...<br> ...a fat man's clothes,|to throw us off the track.<br> He even put in a belt buckle|with an "R" on it...<br> ...hoping we would think|it was Rosebreen...<br> ...an old enemy of Wynant's|who disappeared years ago.<br> Morelli, would you mind|holding your knife some other way?<br> You're worrying Gilbert.<br> If that knife is missing,|I'll look for it in your back.<br> After our hero had killed Wynant,|he had a brilliant idea.<br> He realized that he and Julia|could still collect money.<br> Wynant was supposed to be out of town,|no one knew where.<br> So our hero wrote letters to MacCaulay,|signing Wynant's name...<br> ...so that MacCaulay would continue|to send the money to Julia.<br> He even telephoned MacCaulay.<br> You remember the day|you came to see me?<br> He telephoned he was in town?<br> Yes, he called while I was out.<br> Yeah, wasn't he slick about that?<br> That same afternoon, Julia telephoned him.<br> She said you were coming, Mimi.<br> - I wanted to ask about Mr. Wynant.|- Exactly.<br> And our hero got terrified.<br> He was afraid Julia would break down|and tell you that he had murdered Wynant.<br> So he went to Julia, and he killed her.<br> And he left Wynant's watch chain|in her hand.<br> - Is this true?|- I don't know.<br> - Why are you saying it?|- It's the only way it makes sense.<br> I hope you're well.<br> His plan was working beautifully.<br> Everybody believed|that Wynant was in town...<br> ...and that he did it.<br> There was just one hitch.<br> A bird named Nunheim, your friend.<br> Nunheim began to call on her.<br> He heard the shots.|He saw the murderer leave.<br> He knew who did it.<br> If he knew, he didn't tell me!|You can't drag me into this!<br> Our hero had paid Nunheim once|to keep his mouth shut.<br> And when Nunheim threatened him again,|he bumped him off.<br> He was very clever.<br> Everybody, even our astute friend Guild,|thought that Wynant was alive...<br> ...and that he was the murderer.<br> You can skip that.<br> But our hero had just one|weak link in his chain.<br> The telegrams and phone calls|were all very well...<br> ...but no one had actually seen Wynant.<br> So our hero picked on poor Mimi here|to strengthen his case.<br> Mimi is the only one at this table|who can tell us who the real murderer is.<br> Mimi, who was it that told you|to say you saw Wynant?<br> - Nobody told me, I did see him!|- Why don't you let my mother alone?<br> What were you paid to stick to that story?<br> It isn't a story, it's true!|I did see him! He isn't dead!<br> You're lying, Mimi.<br> But you'd do anything for money.<br> You're getting a good price|for saying you saw Wynant.<br> You won't get anything if he's dead.<br> - I'm not going to stay here to be insulted!|- Sit down.<br> MacCaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.<br> Mimi was cut off, wasn't she,|if she remarried?<br> I have no right to answer that.<br> - How about it, Tanner? Isn't that true?|- Yes.<br> You shouldn't let that keep you|from telling the truth.<br> - Mrs. Jorgensen.|- Yes?<br> Were you ever divorced|from Chris Jorgensen?<br> No.<br> So you see, Mimi,|under the law, you've never remarried.<br> You're still one of the heirs.|So what are you holding out for?<br> A few crummy dollars,|when you can get the whole estate?<br> Remember the other two|who were mixed in with him on this...<br> ...Julia and Nunheim.<br> When he thought they might spill,|he bumped them off.<br> You ought to know|he's not going to take a chance on you.<br> What do you want, to be next on his list?<br> Why, you dirty little...<br> - Well, there's your murderer: MacCaulay.|- MacCaulay?<br> Sure, do you want me|to wrap him up in cellophane?<br> Get in there! What's the matter?<br> MacCaulay? I can't believe it!<br> Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!<br> Nicky, he might have killed you!<br> What's the matter? You sorry he didn't?<br> I'm glad you're not a detective.<br> Not a hip in a carload.<br> Well, here's to you two!<br> And to you two, too!<br> - Why, the rat, he can't top us.|- No.<br> - Shall I keep these fresh for you?|- Yes.<br> My gracious, it's 1:00.<br> - It's what?|- 1:00.<br> No, baby, it's 11:00.<br> It is not, it's 1:00. I set my watch ahead.<br> Yeah, you set your watch ahead|at 12:00, didn't you?<br> Look, you're in New York, for instance.|The sun rises in New York.<br> San Francisco is|3,000 miles west of New York.<br> You're wrong!<br> The sun does not get to San Francisco|till three hours after New York.<br> Nick!<br> Yes, baby?<br> Does that mean that it's bedtime?<br> Well, that's a thought.<br> Come on, sugar, leave us do it.<br> Asta, are you ready?<br> - And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.|- Same to you, Nick.<br> Good night.<br> I can never thank you for all you've done.<br> Don't be silly.<br> Good night.<br> Gosh, darling, I thought they'd never leave.<br> I thought you'd never leave.<br> Baby, the sun rises in the east,|it sets in the west.<br> If it's 12:00 in New York,|automatically, it's...<br> Nicky, put Asta in here with me tonight.<br> Oh, yeah?<br>
