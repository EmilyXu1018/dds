Yououtta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.<br> You told him you would.<br> I'll say anything to 'emwhen they're like that.<br> Somebody ought to do it.<br> Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.<br> What's wrong, Jim?<br> There's nothing anybody can do for him.He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.<br> - Then I can't ask you to go out there.- Maybe I could get some morphine into him.<br> - Would it keep him quiet?- Not for long, but I can give him two.<br> And I could maybe leave himthree or four for himself.<br> Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?<br> That's what you are.<br> That's all there is for us.That's us, that's us.<br> I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.<br> All twelve of 'em.<br> It's insanity up there.<br> I told 'em what to do, I showed 'emwhere to go and I gave 'em a push.<br> - Somebody help!- I know you.

Goodbye.<br> Fortunately, Jim, the fate ofthe companydoesn't depend on one man.<br> Sergeant, I saw the whole thingthrough the glasses.<br> I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrowand recommend you for the Silver Star.<br> - It's the most courageous thing...- Captain,<br> you say one more word to thank me,I'll knock you right in the teeth.<br> You mention me in your fuckin' orders,and I'll resign so fast<br> and leave you hereto run this busted-up outfit by yourself.<br> You understand?<br> Property!Whole fuckin' thing's about property.<br> What's the matter with you, Staros? Thosemen should be reinforced immediately!<br> What are they doing?I can see 'em through my glasses.<br> They're lying behind thatledge!<br> They shouldbe up and out,cleaning out those machine guns! Over!<br> I don't think you understandwhat's going on, sir.<br> We've had... heavy casualties.<br> We had a man... His gut got shot outon the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.<br> Fine, fine. Now,what about those reinforcements? Over.<br> I have... two squads to...<br> First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.<br> What the hell do you mean, two squads?!<br> Goddamn you, Staros!When I say reinforcements,<br> goddamn it, I mean it! You commiteverybody you have there and do it now!<br> Your First Platoon, too. I see 'emlying on their fat asses doing nothing.<br> Get a man to 'em right now with orders toattack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.<br> Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!<br> Have 'em press the centre.Go straight up that goddamn hill!<br> Attack them right now!<br> Jesus, Staros! Do lhave to give youa lesson on infantry tactics<br> while yourmenare getting theirasses shot off?.<br> Colonel, I don't think you fully understandwhat is going on here.<br> My company alonecannot take that position, sir.<br> The Japs are too well dug in.They've got too much fire power.<br> Colonel, there's a bunker up there.<br> We can't see it, and it's...it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.<br> I request permissionfor patrol reconnaissance around<br> to the right of Hill 210.I believe the entire position, sir,<br> can be outflankedwith a manoeuvre there in force.<br> - No! Goddamn it, no!- Mightsave lives!<br> There'll be no flanking move.<br> Listen, Staros.You're notgonna take yourmen<br> around into the jungleto avoid a goddamn fight!<br> Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attackright now with every man at your disposal!<br> Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!<br> Sir, I must tell youthat I refuse to obey your order.<br> - There it is, right there. See it?- I don't see it.<br> This is not your fault, Jim.He's ordering you to.<br> I again request permission for patrolreconnaissance around to the right in force.<br> The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.<br> I have two witnesses here. I request thatyou do the same with witnesses there. Over.<br> Staros, don't pull thisguardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!<br> Now, lknowyou're a goddamn lawyer!This is nota court oflaw.<br> This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!<br> Now, I want that frontal attack.I repeat my order. Over.<br> Colonel, I refuse to take my men up therein a frontal attack.<br> It's suicide, sir.<br> I've lived with these men for two years, andI will not order them all to their deaths. Over.<br> This is a very important decision, Staros.<br> But if you feel that strongly, maybeyou have a reason, so I'm coming down.<br> Go take a look.<br> I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,<br> but if I find extenuating circumstanceswhen I get there, I'll take that into account.<br> Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,I want you to hold on until I get there.<br> And, ifpossible, you get those menon the ridge outandmoving! Out.<br> One spot's as good as another, men.<br> There's no place to hide.<br> Just take it easy, son.Take it easy. Take it easy.<br> Where's... where's Fife?<br> Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.<br> Hold my hand, Fife.<br> Hold my hand.<br> I got it.<br> I'm dying, Fife.<br> Oh, Captain...<br> Shut up in a tomb.<br> Can't lift the lid.<br> Played a role lnever conceived.<br> Get that blouse on, soldier.It's not a goddamn bathing beach!<br> Put it on right now.<br> What you aiming at, son?Let's go get those son of a bitches.<br> Move up!<br> What are you doing laying down therewhere you can't see a damn thing?<br> Observing, sir. Just sentFirst Platoon forward to the ridge.<br> - How many of 'em were hit this time?- None, sir.<br> None? Not one?<br> Doesn't sound like the situationyou described to me over the sound power.<br> Well, it's not. The situation's changedjust in the last five minutes, sir.<br> Captain, you listen to me.<br> We're going over thereand taking everybody with us.<br> Do you have any more complaintsor demurrers?<br> - No, sir. Not now.- All right! We're gonna do things my way!<br> My way! You understand that, Captain?<br> We're taking everybody over to that ledge!We may take that ridge by nightfall!<br> I think the ridgeis quite a way from being reduced, sir.<br> Show me how to see things the way you do.<br> Show me how to see things the way you do.<br> We're just dirt. We're just dirt.<br> We're gonna get killed ifwe stay here.<br> Bell, take six men<br> and go see what's up there.<br> And we'll cover you the best we canfrom down there.<br> OK.<br> You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?<br> I'm going alone.<br> Come out.<br> Come out where lam.<br> There was a... There was a...<br> There's a bunker... up there.<br> It's five guns.<br> It's five guns.<br> That strongpoint up there,somewhere up there around those rocks,<br> is the key to this ridge.<br> Bell here is quite right.<br> From their knob up there, those little brownbrothers can cover the whole ofthe ground<br> in front ofthis position for 1,000 yards.They've left this ledge unguarded.<br> Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.That's a hell of a mistake.<br> We need to take advantage of itbefore they see their error.<br> All right, all right,I know you're all pretty exhausted,<br> and we've had a hell of a timegetting water up here.<br> For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.<br> But ifwe can reduce this bunker tomorrow,I think we can take this ridge.<br> So I'm asking for volunteers.<br> Go back up there and knock it out.<br> Sir?<br> I'll be glad to go back up<br> - and lead the way back for a party.- Right.<br> - I'll go, sir.- You.<br> All right.<br> - I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.- All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.<br> - You'll be in command.- I'll go, sir.<br> - Sir?- You.<br> All right, men, that's enough.Seven is plenty. Gather up.<br> I don't know ifyou realise the importanceof this operation, Staros.<br> Once our position is secured,we can move the bombers in.<br> That means air powerfor 1,000 miles in every direction.<br> Guadalcanal may bethe turning point in the war.<br> - It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you?- No, sir.<br> I explained to youthe importance ofthis objective.<br> How many men do you think it's worth?How many lives?<br> I can't say, sir.<br> Are you prepared to sacrifice the livesof any ofyour men in this campaign?<br> How many? One? Two?<br> Twenty?<br> Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.<br> And ifyou don't have the stomach for it,now is the time to let me know.<br> No, sir. You're right...about everything you said.<br> Fine, fine.<br> That's all, Captain.<br> One more thing, Staros.<br> It's not necessary for youto ever tell me that you think I'm right.<br> Ever.<br> We'll assume it.<br> Dismissed.<br> I feel sorry for you, kid.<br> - Yeah?- Yeah, a little.<br> This army's gonna kill you.<br> If you were smart, you'd take care ofyourself.There's nothing you can do for anybody else.<br> You're just running into a burning housewhere nobody can be saved.<br> What difference do you think you can make?One single man in all this madness.<br> If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.<br> There's not some other world out therewhere everything's gonna be OK.<br> There's just this one.<br> Just this rock.<br> Go ahead! Come on, come on.<br> Who's deciding who's gonna live?<br> Who's deciding who's gonna die?<br> This is futile!<br> Look at me!I stand right up here and not one bullet.<br> Not one shot!<br> Why?<br> How come they all had to die?<br> I can stand right here, I can stand right upand nothing happens to me!<br> We.<br> We together.<br> One being.<br> Flow together like water,<br> till I can't tell you from me.<br> I drink you.<br> Now.<br> Now.<br> You're my light.<br> My guide.<br> John, I'll be behind you.If you wanna break through, we'll come after.<br> We'll charge at your whistle signal.<br> All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.<br> OK.<br> Stay down, below this ledge,<br> and I'll call down the data from above.<br> Once the 81s have plastered that rock...as much as possible,<br> we're gonna crawl outalong that big rock for cover<br> and then flank 'em to the right.<br> OK?<br> OK.

Can't take him with us.<br> - No, we can't leave him here.- He's from your platoon. You stay with him.<br> We can leave him and pick him upon the way back,... if he's still alive.<br> - Is he dead?- Not yet.<br> Dale, stay with him!Cover our flank! Move!<br> Behind you!<br> We're pinned down!<br> Fall back!<br> Go!<br> Watch out.<br> Clear!<br> Come on.

When they saw youmake that attack and win,<br> you put their hearts back into them.<br> - Hey, hey!- Don't do that, soldier.<br> Take care ofthe others. G-2 will want them.There'll be somebody around before long.<br> We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.<br> Sir, I've a few recommendationsfor decorations.<br> Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'emthat we can, but later.<br> Meantime, I want you to know I'm personallyrecommending you for something, John.<br> Perhaps the big one.<br> - Thank you, sir, but I don't feel...- Yes, you do, John.<br> Getting it for youwill be the goddamn problem!<br> But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalionand the regiment, ifyou did get it.<br> We better move out.<br> We need to extend our lines, hook up withthe other companies and push on to the top.<br> Would you like to take commandof Baker Company?<br> Of course.<br> Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket,but about the water. Ifwe don't get water...<br> Don't worry about water.<br> John, I don't want anything to break up thisattack of ours now we have the momentum.<br> We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.<br> I've arranged for that.<br> Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it,and wait for it.<br> No, sir.<br> That's right.<br> And if some ofthe men... pass out,why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.<br> All right.<br> They could...<br> - They could die from it.- They could die from enemy fire, too!<br> They're all tough boys.<br> Come on, men, let's go! You'll seeplenty more ofthose where we're going!<br> Are we going up this hill or aren't we?<br> John, I'm convinced thatthe Japanese position can be broken now.<br> All we have to do is keep going and we'llhave this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.<br> You see the spirit in these men?D'you see the new spirit?<br> Well, I want to take advantage ofthat beforesomething happens to sap their strength.<br> To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,<br> or even to have it reinforcedfrom troops from the reserves,<br> if we were to stallbefore reaching the top, well,<br> Jesus Christ, that's justa hell of a lot more than I could stand!<br> I've waited all my life for this.<br> I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untoldbuckets of shit to have this opportunity!<br> And I don't intend to give it up now.<br> You don't know what it feels liketo be passed over.<br> I mean, you're young.You're just out ofthe Academy.<br> You're, you know, you've got your war!This 15 years, this is my first war!<br> John, some day you'll understand.<br> You're like a son to me, John.<br> You know what my son does?<br> He's a bait salesman.<br> You've done a hell of ajob, John.<br> I'm gonna make sure that you get everything,everything that you deserve.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> God...<br> Goddamn it!
