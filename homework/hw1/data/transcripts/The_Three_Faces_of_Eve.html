                        This is a true story.<br> How often have you seen that statement<br> at the beginning of a picture?<br> It sometimes means<br> that there was a man named Napoleon,<br> but that any similarity between what he did<br> in life and what he's going to do in this movie<br> is strictly miraculous.<br> Well, this is a true story,<br> about a sweet,<br> rather baffled young housewife,<br> who, in 1951, in her hometown in Georgia,<br> suddenly frightened her husband<br> by behaving very unlike herself.<br> There's nothing unique in that.<br> We all have moods.<br> We all have a secret yen to behave<br> like somebody we particularly admire.<br> A modern writer has said that inside every<br> fat man, a thin man is struggling to get out.<br> Well, in a literal and terrifying sense,<br> inside this demure young woman<br> two very vivid and different personalities<br> were battling for the mastery of her character.<br> She was, in fact, a case of what is called<br> "multiple personality",<br> something that all psychiatrists have<br> read about and very few have ever seen.<br> Certainly not Dr Thigpen and Dr Cleckley,<br> of the Medical College of Georgia,<br> who one day were confronted with a woman<br> who had one personality more than Dr Jekyll.<br> Their account of the case was delivered to<br> the American Psychiatric Association in 1953,<br> and it's already a classic<br> of psychiatric literature.<br> So this movie needed no help<br> from the imagination of a fiction writer.<br> The truth itself was fabulous enough.<br> And all the episodes you're going to see<br> happened to this girl they call Eve White,<br> and much of the dialogue is taken from the<br> clinical record of the doctor we call Dr Luther.<br> The date is August 20th, 1951.<br> (woman) Come in.<br> - Mrs White?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Dr Luther.<br> - Yes?<br> Mrs White is here. The lady<br> Dr Watkins wrote to you about.<br> - Ask her to come in, will you?<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> Will you come in, please?<br> - How do you do, Mrs White?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Come in. Sit here, will you?<br> - Thank you.<br> Mr White.<br> Let's see.<br> Thank you.<br> Dr Watkins is a very old friend of mine.<br> How long have you known him?<br> He's the doctor we go to.<br> He's a very able man. Very able.<br> Let's see. He says you've been troubled<br> with very bad headaches.<br> Yes, sir, terrible ones.<br> - And some sort of spells?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What kind of spell?<br> I don't know. l'm not exactly sure.<br> What happens when you have one?<br> Is it, uh, what they say, uh... amnesia?<br> Well, amnesia means loss of memory.<br> Is that what happens to you?<br> Yes, I guess that's it.<br> - How often does this happen?<br> - Sometimes twice a week now.<br> - And the headaches, what about them?<br> - Same thing.<br> - They happen at the same time?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> First I get this terrible headache<br> and then I get this spell.<br> Now, when you say "spell",<br> do you mean you faint or anything like that?<br> No, sir, it's not like faintin'. It's more like...<br> Well, it's like the other day I was playing<br> out in the back yard with Bonnie<br> and all of a sudden I got this splitting<br> headache and then the next thing I knew,<br> I mean, the next thing I was conscious of,<br> it was the next morning.<br> - Who's Bonnie?<br> - Oh, that's my little girl.<br> - How old is she?<br> - She's four and a half.<br> - Your only child?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - I lost another baby about four months ago.<br> - I see.<br> And you have no recollection<br> at all of what happened?<br> Where you were or what you did between<br> the time you were playing in the back yard<br> and the next morning?<br> No, sir, I don't.<br> Were you at home at the time?<br> I was there as soon as<br> I come home from work.<br> Yes?<br> I didn't see much different in her.<br> Well, did you see any difference?<br> I guess not. Nothing you could say<br> was really different.<br> For several weeks Mrs White was<br> greatly helped by the psychiatric treatment.<br> She had fewer headaches<br> and they were less severe.<br> She had no more blackout spells -<br> at least, none that she was aware of.<br> But not quite a year later,<br> several things happened that showed her<br> to be in urgent need of help.<br> The first alarm was sounded<br> around noontime of a spring day in 1952.<br> Anybody home?<br> Oh, hey. Just a minute<br> while I hang out the wash.<br> - Where's Bonnie?<br> - Here I am.<br> - Hi, sugar.<br> - l'm wearing Mom's shoes.<br> Mommy will tan your britches<br> if she finds you.<br> This one hurts.<br> - Where'd you get these?<br> - They're Mommy's.<br> - Where'd she get'em?<br> - The postman brought them today<br> - with the dresses.<br> - What dresses?<br> On the bed.<br> Evie?<br> - Let me have them.<br> - No! I wanna wear 'em. Mommy said I could!<br> Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!<br> What's the idea of all this?<br> Didn't you buy'em?<br> What do you mean, didn't I buy'em?<br> Didn't you?<br> No, I thought you did.<br> I thought it was sweet, but I...<br> It's got your name on it.<br> You know I wouldn't buy<br> anything like that, Ralph.<br> - $218.<br> - That's what I mean, they cost that much.<br> - Where'd they get your name?<br> - I don't know. I thought you did it.<br> I mean, I thought you bought 'em for me.<br> But I was gonna make you take 'em back<br> because I knew it was too much.<br> l'll say it's too much.<br> You had me scared there for a minute.<br> I guess they just must have made<br> some kind of mistake, that's all.<br> Well, l'll call'em.<br> - Is this the Beehive Store?<br> - Yes, sir. Is there anrthing I can do for you?<br> - Is this Miss Effie?<br> - Who is this?<br> It's Ralph White.<br> For goodness sakes, I thought you and Evie<br> would be on your way to Hollywood by now.<br> - Hollywood?<br> - With all those pretty things Evie bought.<br> You ought to be proud of<br> how she looks in those dresses.<br> Especially that lilac one.<br> l'm bringing'em all back this afternoon.<br> (Eve) Bonnie?<br> - Come on in, honey, and wash your hands.<br> - Tell her not to come in yet.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Tell her l'll call her.<br> Never mind, honey.<br> l'll call you when we're ready.<br> Shut that door.<br> Hurry up.<br> Come here.<br> Will you come here?<br> I got a good mind to slap your face.<br> - What'd they say?<br> - What kind of dope do you think I am?<br> I don't know what you're talkin' about.<br> What did you think I was gonna do? Nothing?<br> Let you get away with it? 218 bucks!<br> - I didn't buy'em.<br> - You mean Miss Effie Blandford's a liar?<br> - She said I bought 'em?<br> - She didn't say nothin' else.<br> I don't see how she could.<br> You mean to tell me<br> you didn't try on those dresses?<br> I haven't been in the Beehive in months.<br> Sometimes I don't know whether<br> you're crazy or you think I am.<br> Are they gonna take 'em back?<br> l'll pack'em up for you.<br> - l'll do it.<br> - Let me.<br> You heard me. I said l'd do it.<br> (Bonnie) l'm hungry, Mommy.<br> (screams)<br> Evie!<br> (shrieks)<br> It's all right, honey.<br> (wails)<br> It's OK. You'll be all right.<br> It's all right, honey.<br> Don't get up.<br> l'll kill you if you get up.<br> - I didn't do it.<br> - But I saw her.<br> I didn't do it.<br> How can she say a thing like that<br> when I saw her with my own eyes?<br> - You mean you don't remember doing it.<br> - I didn't do it.<br> - I suppose you didn't buy those clothes?<br> - l'd die before l'd hurt Bonnie.<br> Why do you suppose Ralph says<br> things like that if they're not true?<br> - I love her too much.<br> - You wouldn't come home last month.<br> She went to Atlanta and then wouldn't come<br> home cos she was havin' too big a time.<br> When I went up to get her, she cussed<br> me and said she never would come home.<br> - How about how much you loved her then?<br> - Will you let me talk to her alone?<br> She wouldn't come home to me or to Bonnie.<br> We'll just be a few minutes.<br> You didn't answer my question, Mrs White.<br> That's not true, what he said.<br> What's not true?<br> - I haven't been to Atlanta in nearly a year.<br> - That's what I mean.<br> Why do you think he says<br> things like that if they're not true?<br> - I don't know.<br> - But he'd have to have some reason to do it.<br> - Yes, sir, I suppose so.<br> - Have you thought what that might be?<br> - I thought of one.<br> - What was that?<br> Maybe he wants to get Bonnie<br> away from me.<br> - Do you mean by divorce?<br> - No, sir, maybe not that.<br> But maybe he can make me believe<br> l'm losing my mind.<br> - Is that what you think he's trying to do?<br> - I don't know what else it could be.<br> - Am I?<br> - I find no evidence of it.<br> - But you're not positive.<br> - I couldn't be positive of anything so quickly.<br> But the fact you may be having<br> spells of amnesia<br> doesn't mean that you're what you call<br> losing your mind. Doesn't mean that at all.<br> It's no use.<br> Cos I am. You don't want to tell me,<br> but I know it now.<br> How do you know it, Mrs White?<br> Because now l'm hearin' voices too.<br> What kind of voices?<br> Just one voice.<br> But that's what that means, doesn't it?<br> - How long has this been going on?<br> - For months.<br> Why didn't you tell me this before?<br> What does this voice say to you?<br> She tells me to do things.<br> A woman's voice?<br> Can you recognise it in any way?<br> No, sir.<br> It sounds familiar sometimes,<br> but I don't really recognise it.<br> What does this voice tell you to do?<br> To do things like... leave Ralph,<br> take Bonnie and run away.<br> All kind of terrible things like that.<br> That is what it means, isn't it?<br> No, not in your case.<br> - But that's what everybody says.<br> - And in most cases they'd be right.<br> It's a serious manifestation,<br> the hearing of voices.<br> But the difference in your case is this:<br> you've been frightened by this voice<br> because you recognise it<br> as a symptom of illness.<br> People who are actually losing their minds<br> rarely find anything extraordinary<br> about hearing voices.<br> They almost invariably assume it's<br> some sort of extra privilege that they enjoy,<br> like personal radio reception<br> or a built-in radar.<br> Yeah, but what if sometimes it...<br> it sounds like my own voice?<br> Your own voice?<br> - Doesn't make any difference.<br> - Yes, it does.<br> You just don't wanna tell me, but it does, I...<br> Mrs White?<br> Hi.<br> Feeling better now?<br> I feel fine.<br> - What was it? A headache?<br> - No, I didn't have no headache.<br> She had one, but I didn't.<br> - "She"?<br> - You got a nice place around here.<br> Oh, she always gets those headaches<br> when I wanna come out.<br> I think she's a real dope, don't you?<br> - Who are you talking about?<br> - Eve White.<br> It's these hose.<br> They're nylon and l'm allergic to nylon.<br> I think l'll take'em off.<br> You don't mind, do you?<br> If you like.<br> I think you'd better turn around, though.<br> You're kinda cute,<br> but I don't think I know you that well.<br> Maybe sometime, though, huh?<br> - Hey, you like to go dancin'?<br> - Sometimes.<br> Would you like to go dancin' with me?<br> OK, you can turn around now.<br> - So you're not Eve White?<br> - I certainly am not.<br> Maybe one night this week.<br> You can tell your wife you gotta see a patient.<br> - And do what?<br> - And go dancin'.<br> I bet you're a real cute dancer.<br> I doubt if my wife would agree,<br> but back to the point -<br> if you're not Eve White, who are you?<br> Now what are you trying to do, kid me?<br> Seems more likely you're trying to kid me.<br> l'm Eve Black. You know that.<br> - You mean that was your maiden name?<br> - That's still my name.<br> l've never been married.<br> That's for laughs, gettin' married.<br> - What about Ralph?<br> - You don't think l'd marry ajerk like that?<br> And Bonnie isn't your child?<br> Not while l'm in my right mind she isn't.<br> Boy, what fat books.<br> Hey, is this radio working?<br> You got a back door to your office.<br> We could get out without him seeing.<br> - Will you excuse me?<br> - You're not gonna tell him, are you?<br> l'll be right back. You wait here.<br> It's up too high.<br> Excuse me. l'll be right back.<br> Is that her?<br> - Ever had a case of multiple personality?<br> - No.<br> Do you think you'd recognise one<br> if you saw one?<br> I don't know. l'm not so sure.<br> But I can tell you this, l'll bet ya<br> I can spot a fake as far as I can see one.<br> - Whom do you suspect?<br> - Mrs White. Mrs Eve White.<br> - That dreary little woman?<br> - That's the one.<br> (music louder)<br> Everything all right?<br> Oh, hi. Got your buddy with you, huh?<br> - May I turn this off?<br> - Oh, sure. What did I do, scare you?<br> - You remember Dr Day?<br> - Sure. Hi.<br> - How are you, Mrs White?<br> - That's what you think.<br> - This is Miss Eve Black, Doctor.<br> - How do you do, Miss Black?<br> How do you do?<br> - You don't mind talking to both of us?<br> - The more there are, the better I like 'em.<br> And you say you are not Mrs White now?<br> OK, you wanna hear it again?<br> I am not Mrs White. My name is Eve Black.<br> Then how does it happen<br> that you remember meeting me?<br> Cos I know everything that happens to her.<br> She don't know anything about me,<br> but I know everything about her.<br> Everything I want to, anyway.<br> There's some things about her l'm not<br> interested in, like thatjughead out there.<br> Mr White, she means.<br> And the thing is, she don't really<br> even care anything about him.<br> She tells herself she does<br> cos she thinks she ought to.<br> Don't think I never told her so, too.<br> - What did you tell her?<br> - Leave the so-and-so.<br> Take the kid and beat it.<br> What can he do about it?<br> - How did you tell her?<br> - I yelled at her.<br> I don't know whether she heard me or not,<br> but I really hollered at her.<br> Boy, I can tell you, though,<br> l'm gonna fix his wagon.<br> I ain't gonna go through<br> the rest of my life with that creep.<br> And you say that Bonnie is not your child?<br> Oh, now, Doctor. How could I have a child<br> if l'm not even married?<br> You tryin'to insinuate somethin'?<br> - You mean Ralph never made love to you?<br> - Boy, l'd like to see him try.<br> Where were you, then,<br> when Bonnie was born?<br> It looks like to me that's your problem,<br> Doctor, not mine.<br> Don't you have any fans in this office?<br> It's hot in here.<br> How are you gonna fix Ralph's wagon?<br> - You really wanna know?<br> - I do indeed.<br> l'm gonna come out and l'm gonna stay out.<br> - Were you ever on the stage, Miss Black?<br> - No, not exactly on the stage.<br> But I sang in nightclubs, a lot of 'em.<br> - Where?<br> - Well, across the river's one.<br> - The Big Apple. You ever been there?<br> - No, l'm afraid I haven't.<br> They're crazy about me at the Big Apple.<br> Every time I go in there,<br> they ask me to stand up and sing.<br> Of course, I have to be<br> in the mood to do it, though.<br> - What kind of mood?<br> - I have to have a couple of snorts first.<br> Can you come out,<br> as you call it, whenever you want to?<br> No. I wish I could, but I can't.<br> Sometimes I can, but sometimes I can't.<br> But it's getting easier. Cos she's gettin'<br> weaker and l'm gettin' stronger.<br> And one of these days,<br> l'm gonna come out and stay out,<br> just you wait and see.<br> And can you retire,<br> go back in when you want to?<br> Sure. You know what I done one night?<br> One night Ralph had to go to Savannah,<br> so I went over to the Big Apple<br> and I got kinda gassed up.<br> You know what I done the next morning?<br> I let her have the hangover.<br> (giggles)<br> - She's faking.<br> - Oh, you should have seen her face.<br> Listen, Mrs White,<br> I regret to have to say this, but I...<br> Hello, Doctor.<br> Mrs White?<br> On May 17th, 1952,<br> Mrs White was admitted to the psychiatric<br> section of the University Hospital<br> for observation and treatment.<br> During the first week, her behaviour was<br> excellent. There was nothing uneven about it.<br> But Dr Luther still<br> could not decide when, or even if,<br> to confront her with the knowledge of<br> the personality that she had suppressed.<br> "Love took up the glass of Time,<br> and turn'd it in his glowing hands;<br> Every moment, lightly shaken,<br> ran itself in golden sands."<br> "Love took up the harp of Life,<br> and smote on all the chords with might;<br> Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling,<br> pass"d in music out of sight."<br> That's beautiful. l've never heard it before.<br> Well, I don't really understand what it means.<br> I just like to read it anyway.<br> Doesn't have to mean anything in particular.<br> Good morning.<br> Would you like to read this one?<br> "Dear, beauteous Death..."<br> - Good morning, Doctor.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, Doctor.<br> - How's it going?<br> - Oh, I feel much better, thank you.<br> - She looks better, too, don't you think?<br> - Yeah, she really does.<br> - See you later, Mrs White.<br> - l'll be in the office, Doctor.<br> - Thanks, Lenny.<br> - Heard from Ralph?<br> - He came by for a few minutes yesterday.<br> - What about Bonnie?<br> - She's back with my mother and father now.<br> Tell me something, Mrs White.<br> Would you say that your marriage,<br> speaking of it as a whole,<br> has been a happy one?<br> No, sir.<br> Well, some of it, but not as a whole.<br> Don't you love Ralph?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Then why do you think<br> it hasn't been a happy marriage?<br> I don't know.<br> I guess I just haven't<br> been able to make him happy.<br> I don't know what it is I do<br> that irritates him so much, but I do.<br> Well, tell me something else.<br> Have you ever had the feeling that,<br> somewhere deep down inside you,<br> there might be somebody<br> you couldn't quite reach,<br> but that you nevertheless knew was there?<br> No, sir.<br> I don't know what you're talkin' about.<br> - Good night, Doctor.<br> - Good night.<br> Hey.<br> Come here a minute.<br> Come on. I ain't gonna bite ya.<br> - Got a cigarette?<br> - Oh, sure.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Why don't you come in for a minute?<br> - Well, no. No, you know the rules.<br> Aw, come on.<br> I got a poem for you.<br> Come on. Hm?<br> I... I can't stay long, though.<br> It's a limerick.<br> Chicken!<br> - Dr Luther?<br> - Yes?<br> - About Mrs White...<br> - Yes?<br> That lady is a whole lot healthier<br> than you think she is, Doctor.<br> Can you control your emergence?<br> - Says which?<br> - I want you not to come out, even if you can.<br> l'm tired of this place.<br> - It's a nuthouse.<br> - It's a hospital.<br> You don't see any bars<br> or anything like that, do you?<br> Is she crazy?<br> No, but you can drive her crazy<br> if you don't behave yourself.<br> Why? I don't know what I have to do with it.<br> I haven't got anything to do with her.<br> You're wasting your time with that.<br> l'm a doctor.<br> - You're cute, you know that?<br> - Listen...<br> Hey, look, why don't you and I go out and<br> have some fun? I can slip on somethin'.<br> Do you wanna be shut up<br> in one of these places for life?<br> One with bars?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I mean if you get into any trouble at all,<br> Mrs White will be adjudged crazy,<br> but it'll be both of you that'll be locked up.<br> But why, if l'm all right?<br> You're not gonna be subdivided<br> by any court or board l've heard of yet.<br> Where Mrs White goes, you go. And that<br> means into an asylum if she's committed.<br> An asylum with locked doors and bars<br> and straitjackets. Now, is that clear?<br> I guess so.<br> Well, it had better be.<br> Cos that'd be the end of it for you too.<br> No more dancing, no more... snorts,<br> no more anything.<br> Ever.<br> Even if I don't come out,<br> what do you figure to do about it?<br> I don't know. l'm not sure.<br> Nobody knows too much about this, because<br> there haven't been too many such cases.<br> But for a starter... I think<br> l'd like to tell Eve White about you.<br> What do you want to do that for?<br> - You object?<br> - Won't that worry her even more?<br> I thought you didn't care<br> what happened to her.<br> I don't really.<br> But I mean, you know, if she worries any<br> more, ain't she liable to go crazy anyway?<br> l'm afraid that is a possibility, but that's<br> a chance I think we're gonna have to take.<br> If we're ever gonna reunite these<br> two personalities, to put it simply,<br> l'd say the first logical step<br> to take in that direction<br> would be to introduce 'em to each other.<br> Introduce 'em? Ha!<br> Doc, you flip me, you really do.<br> Look. I don't have to put on much.<br> Let's go on out and have a little fun.<br> Mrs White.<br> I don't underst...<br> I had another one, hadn't I?<br> A little one.<br> I was hopin'...<br> I think l'd better tell you as well as I can<br> just what the situation is.<br> Have you ever heard of multiple personality?<br> Now all Dr Luther had to do<br> was to explain this situation to Ralph.<br> - How are you, Ralph?<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - How's Evie?<br> - Much better now.<br> - Have you found out what's wrong with her?<br> - That's what I wanted to talk to you about.<br> It's a very unusual case.<br> One of the rarest, in fact,<br> in the history of psychiatry.<br> You don't say.<br> Mrs White's problem is<br> what is called multiple personality.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Have you ever heard of that?<br> - No, sir, I can't say as I ever have.<br> - What actually happens is this:<br> At some point in the past,<br> apparently when she was a little girl,<br> her personality became divided<br> into two different personalities.<br> In effect, she's now two different women,<br> entirely different in character.<br> To be more specific about it -<br> the girl you married, Bonnie's mother,<br> the sweet, quiet girl you fell in love with,<br> that's one of the women.<br> The other is the one that scared Bonnie,<br> the one who bought all those clothes<br> and had that row with you in Atlanta.<br> You know those headaches<br> and blackout spells?<br> Well, that was when this other woman,<br> the one who calls herself Eve Black,<br> was trying to get out.<br> Out of where?<br> Out of the body. Your wife's body.<br> Well, how do you like that?<br> But what I want you to understand<br> is that this is an actual mental condition.<br> It isn't pretending or faking.<br> She can't help it.<br> But that doesn't mean she's psychotic.<br> Crazy.<br> Do you understand?<br> No, sir.<br> Well, let's see if I can put it<br> to you in another way.<br> In the first place, no one has ever defined<br> the personality as a psychopathological...<br> - I think you'd better come with me.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> (knock on door)<br> Come in.<br> - You've got company this morning.<br> - Hello, honey.<br> Hi.<br> - How's Bonnie?<br> - She's all right.<br> I asked Ralph to come in so that<br> I could explain the situation to him.<br> So he'll understand when you leave here.<br> You know who he is, don't you?<br> - You mean Ralph?<br> - Who is he?<br> Well, he's my husband, of course.<br> And you're the mother of his child,<br> aren't you?<br> Of course.<br> - You're Mrs White? That's your name?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> All right, now, may I speak with Eve Black?<br> Of course.<br> Eve Black?<br> - Oh, spit!<br> - You know who this is?<br> - I sure do.<br> - Now, just a minute there.<br> Your husband?<br> If I have told you once I have told you<br> ten thousand times, I ain't got no husband.<br> If I was gonna have one, it wouldn't be<br> no lead-bottom like Ralph White.<br> - What'd you have to tell him for?<br> - Bonnie isn't your child?<br> - She's her child and you know it.<br> - I got a good mind to slap your face.<br> - l'd like to see you try.<br> - You ain't foolin' me.<br> Don't get angry.<br> Just talk to her and watch her.<br> And don't use your temper,<br> use your sense about it.<br> May I speak to Mrs White?<br> You sure can. And don't ever bring me back<br> while that pea-picker's here.<br> Mrs White?<br> - Did I go out again?<br> - Just for a few minutes.<br> - Evie?<br> - Eve Black?<br> - I told you I wasn't gonna talk to him again.<br> - Mrs White?<br> After she'd been in the hospital for two<br> weeks, Dr Luther and Dr Day were satisfied<br> that whether she behaved<br> as Eve White or Eve Black,<br> she would do no harm to herself or to others.<br> So, on 30th May, 1952,<br> they discharged her.<br> During those two weeks, Ralph<br> had left Bonnie with the grandparents<br> and found for himself a better job<br> in Jacksonville, Florida.<br> But Mrs White was not to go with him.<br> For, on the advice of Dr Luther, she decided<br> to stay in town, in a furnished room,<br> for further and more regular treatment.<br> This decision caused a separation<br> that was to have unexpected consequences.<br> Might as well get started, I guess.<br> - Ralph, l'm awful sorry.<br> - That's all right. You couldn't help it.<br> Breakin' up everything like this.<br> Well, he can get you well, can't he?<br> - I hope so.<br> - Didn't he say?<br> - No.<br> - Didn't he say anything?<br> He said he'd do the best he could.<br> That's about the only thing he could do.<br> - Maybe.<br> - Well, I think he will, honey.<br> They don't like to promise too much,<br> you know.<br> - You really think so?<br> - You know how some of 'em are.<br> They like to make a big thing out of it so<br> as they look better when they knock it off.<br> The only trouble, though,<br> I sure am gonna miss Bonnie.<br> She's OK. Your folks<br> will take care of her all right.<br> You don't have to worry about her.<br> Yeah, but if I don't get well,<br> I might never see her again.<br> Stop that, will you? Of course you'll<br> see her again, cos you are gonna get well.<br> I mean, you ain't really crazy, you know.<br> He told me that hisself.<br> I mean, I asked him confidentially<br> and he said no.<br> He said there were nothing the matter<br> with you except this multiplied personality.<br> And that ain't anywhere near crazy.<br> Now, he told me that hisself.<br> You gonna stop worrying now?<br> - l'll try.<br> - You do that and you'll be all right.<br> Goodbye, honey.<br> l'll send you some more money on Saturday.<br> Oh, you don't have to do that.<br> l'm gonna get ajob.<br> That'd help,<br> but l'll still send you some money.<br> You take care of yourself, you hear?<br> (hums)<br> - I feel like singing.<br> - So what's stopping you?<br> All right.<br> Hey. Do you know "Hold Me"?<br> You got it, pretty woman. OK, fellas...<br> - Stand back, Big Daddy.<br> - One, two...<br> (sings "Hold Me')<br> Oh, wait a minute. I forgot my shoes.<br> Thank you.<br> - Let's get outta here.<br> - No, l'm thirsty. I want a drink.<br> - l'll get us a bottle on the way.<br> - On the way where?<br> - Hey, how about a snort, tall, dark and ugly?<br> - Come on. l'll find a place.<br> What are you talking about?<br> This place is fine. I like it.<br> Look, I gotta be back<br> to the post by one. Let's go.<br> Are you crazy? l'm not going any place with<br> you. I don't know what you're talkin' about.<br> Don't give me that.<br> I didn't buy you all these drinks for nothing.<br> All right, l'll go with you some other time.<br> You're going with me now<br> if you don't want some of this.<br> Stop it. That hurts. Let me go.<br> - See what I mean?<br> - You hurt me. I don't like to get hurt.<br> You know how much I shelled out<br> on you already? Eight bucks' worth.<br> When I spend eight bucks on a chick,<br> I don'tjust go home with the morning paper.<br> So let's not have<br> any more arguments about it.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> What kind of a gag is this?<br> Maybe she's sick.<br> Say, look, honey, I...<br> (sobs)<br> Ah! For the love of Mike.<br> We missed you Sunday.<br> Where were you?<br> - I went up on the bus to see Bonnie.<br> - l'll bet she was glad to see you.<br> - Oh, Ralph.<br> - Hi, Eve.<br> - Why didn't you let me know?<br> - I wanted to surprise you.<br> - Mr Fox, would you excuse us, please?<br> - Certainly, ma'am.<br> Siddown, won't you?<br> You know why I come up here?<br> I want you to come back with me.<br> - I can't do that. l'm not well yet.<br> - Who says you ain't?<br> Dr Luther. I know it's true.<br> I think it's even worse now.<br> Is he the one who told you<br> to go out to the Big Apple every night?<br> That's... that's what I mean.<br> I didn't know about it.<br> Thought I wouldn't find out about it, huh?<br> - I didn't know about it, I tell you.<br> - You didn't know about it?<br> You knew enough about it to get ginned up.<br> You was well enough for that.<br> Fella I know saw you out there, twice.<br> Tight as a tick and dancin'<br> and throwing your dress up.<br> Ralph, now,<br> Dr Luther explained all that to you.<br> He even showed you. You told me so.<br> Now, look. I don't know which one of you is<br> foolin', you or him - but somebody is.<br> Because l've been askin' people about it.<br> I asked two doctors,<br> and you know what they said?<br> They said it looked like<br> somebody was kiddin' somebody.<br> But, Ralph, it is somethin'. Believe me, it is.<br> Then let it be something in Jacksonville.<br> Where are your bags? Let's get outta here.<br> If I don't check out of that motel by ten,<br> they'll charge me for another six hours.<br> I won't leave here until l'm well again,<br> not till I have Bonnie back with me.<br> OK, we'll get Bonnie<br> and take her with us.<br> l'm not gonna be alone with her,<br> not till l'm well.<br> You're not gonna be alone with her?<br> She tried to hurt Bonnie once before.<br> She scared her.<br> Will you cut that out?<br> I don't wanna hear any more about it.<br> Why don't you just talk to Dr Luther<br> just for a few minutes?<br> - No, I already talked to two regular doctors.<br> - Then l'm not going!<br> You know what you need?<br> You need a darned good whippin'.<br> - Knock some of that nuttiness out of you.<br> - l'm not goin' and that's all there is to it.<br> I suppose you'd rather stay here<br> and go to that Big Apple.<br> Not until Dr Luther tells me I can leave.<br> And what if I don't want you by then?<br> Well, I can't help it.<br> l'm not gonna leave here, not until l'm well.<br> - You don't want to see Bonnie again?<br> - Not until l'm well, no.<br> I wouldn't count on it then either,<br> if I were you.<br> If you think l'll have people laughing at me,<br> you got another think comin'.<br> If you were really crazy, it'd be different.<br> But not this multiplied thing.<br> So you don't come with me now,<br> that's all there is to it, you understand?<br> I can't help it, Ralph.<br> OK, if that's the way you want it.<br> - (knock on door)<br> - Come in.<br> Hi.<br> Where'd you get that dress?<br> You like it?<br> - Did you buy that yourself?<br> - Got a lot of skirt, see?<br> - I never saw that dress before.<br> - That's because you've been away.<br> - Why don't you fix me one of them drinks?<br> - You kiddin'?<br> Well, don't you wanna give me one?<br> Well, I never seen you take a drink before.<br> There are a lotta things you never seen me<br> do before. That's no sign I don't do 'em.<br> Are you gonna fix me one or not?<br> Don't look like to me<br> you're awful glad to see me.<br> After comin' up all of this way, too.<br> Straight.<br> - You ain't foolin' me.<br> - I don't know what you're talkin' about.<br> - I know what you're tryin' to do.<br> - What?<br> You're tryin' to make me think<br> you're that... that other one.<br> - What other one?<br> - You know what I mean.<br> You mean you don't even know<br> your own wife when you see her?<br> You ain't Evie.<br> You think not?<br> I never seen Evie do a thing like that<br> in my whole life before.<br> - You don't like it?<br> - That ain't the question.<br> Come here.<br> Oh, come on. Sit down.<br> Oh, come on. l'm not gonna bite ya.<br> You know, you're real cute.<br> - What are you up to?<br> - Well, l'm not up to a thing.<br> I just said you were cute.<br> Something wrong with that?<br> - No, but I...<br> - You know, I didn't used to go for you.<br> But you must be gettin' cuter these days,<br> cos you sure look cute to me now.<br> Are you really...?<br> Really what?<br> l'll be doggoned if I ever saw anything<br> like this in my whole life before.<br> You ain't mad, are you?<br> No, I guess not.<br> You know what you ought to do?<br> What?<br> I think you ought to ask me<br> to go to Jacksonville with you.<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Well, you asked her.<br> - I don't know if this is the same thing or not.<br> - You wanted her to go with you, didn't you?<br> Aah! Oh, oh, oh!<br> Oh, boy, you work faster<br> than I thought you did.<br> l'm gonna tell your wife on you.<br> What do you mean, my wife?<br> You are my wife.<br> That's not what you said a few minutes ago.<br> You really want to go away with me?<br> - Maybe. Only not tonight I can't.<br> - Why not tonight?<br> Cos I ain't got anything<br> to wear to Jacksonville.<br> - We could pick up some things.<br> - Them ol' tacky things?<br> This is the only really nice dress I got.<br> It's gettin' kinda old.<br> Besides, can't go to Jacksonville<br> with just one dress, even if it was new.<br> If I buy you a dress,<br> will you go away with me?<br> Maybe. If you buy me a pretty one.<br> - Will you go now?<br> - I can't. Stores ain't open now.<br> - Don't you trust me?<br> - Sure. I just want the dress first.<br> OK. Give us a little kiss.<br> - Does that mean you'll buy me somethin'?<br> - I told you I would, didn't I?<br> OK. Butjust a little one.<br> (squealing)<br> - Hey, is that what you call a little one?<br> - Hey.<br> - What?<br> - Come here.<br> I think we'd better get started, don't you?<br> l'll wait for you in the car.<br> Don't take too long, though.<br> - Won't you even sit close to me?<br> - Mm-mm.<br> Not until you buy me somethin' pretty.<br> (sings "I Never Knew")<br> You didn't have to wait up for me.<br> Shut that door.<br> All I was doin'was just dancin'.<br> Come here.<br> Come here!<br> You ain't mad, are you?<br> Oh, dear God.<br> Let's not kid ourselves. We're losing.<br> She's in worse condition today<br> than when she walked in two years ago.<br> - The divorce, you mean?<br> - No, it's more than that.<br> I don't believe the divorce<br> actually affected her seriously.<br> Bonnie's the only thing with her -<br> not Ralph or marriage.<br> And that's the discouraging part of it.<br> The truth is neither Eve Black nor Mrs White<br> is a satisfactory solution.<br> Neither of them is really qualified<br> to fill the role of wife, mother,<br> or even responsible human being.<br> A victory for either would be disastrous.<br> No solution whatever.<br> And as for memories, infancy, childhood...<br> Perhaps I should say childhoods - she says<br> she's been coming out since she was six.<br> ...an empty, almost<br> abnormally normal history.<br> - Some patients are really so inconsiderate.<br> - They are indeed.<br> It wouldn't have hurt her to have had some<br> shocking experience when she was little.<br> Something rather nasty she saw in the attic.<br> (buzzer)<br> - Yes?<br> - Miss Black is here.<br> - Miss Black?<br> - Miss Eve Black.<br> Tell him l'm all dyked out for him.<br> She's all dressed up for you.<br> Very pretty, with flowers in her hair.<br> - Miss Eve Black, in person.<br> - Want to try hypnosis again?<br> You mean keep punting<br> and wait for a fumble?<br> - How do you do, Miss Black?<br> - Well, both docs.<br> You gonna protect him against me?<br> The way you look this morning,<br> l'm not so sure he'd want me to.<br> Well, say, you look pretty sharp yourself,<br> you know that?<br> She's your patient, Doctor.<br> l'm much too old for that sort of thing.<br> He's pretty cute sometimes, don't you think?<br> He's a living doll. Will you come in?<br> Maybe l'd like him better than I do you.<br> - What's the idea of all this?<br> - I wouldn't let her come back.<br> - Why not?<br> - Cos something's wrong.<br> - You think so?<br> - Well, she tried to kill herself last night.<br> Something's wrong somewhere.<br> - How did she try to kill herself?<br> - With a razor blade.<br> She's feeling awfully low,<br> and when I got what she had in her mind,<br> it scared me half to death.<br> Cos you know, if somebody<br> didn't stop her, l'd be gone too.<br> - Go on.<br> - Well, wasn't anybody else there but me.<br> So when she went in the bathroom<br> and she locked the door... Look.<br> She made one slash and then I got out<br> and I made her drop the blade and...<br> I got it and threw it away.<br> But it was a close call.<br> - Do you think she meant it?<br> - I know she meant it.<br> I wouldn't have meant it.<br> I might be tryin' to scare somebody<br> or fool 'em or somethin',<br> but I wouldn't go that far.<br> - I understand.<br> - But she was really levelling.<br> She really was gonna kill herself<br> if I hadn't stopped her.<br> When you said there was<br> something wrong somewhere,<br> did you mean something more<br> than the effort to kill herself?<br> - I sure did.<br> - What?<br> Now l'm havin' blackout spells too.<br> You mean lapses of time when<br> you don't remember what's happened?<br> And let me tell you, it scares me, too.<br> - May I speak to Mrs White?<br> - Of course.<br> Mrs White?<br> Eve Black tells me you were very low.<br> Yes, I was.<br> Would you mind<br> going under hypnosis again?<br> If you say so.<br> All right. Now, relax.<br> Completely.<br> When I count to three,<br> you'll be in a deep hypnotic state.<br> You understand? All right, now.<br> One...<br> Your eyelids are getting heavy.<br> Very heavy.<br> Two...<br> Relax.<br> Three.<br> Who are you?<br> Who do you think?<br> I have no idea.<br> May I ask who you are?<br> I don't know that either.<br> - Would you excuse me for a minute?<br> - Certainly.<br> How's your heart?<br> Can you take another one?<br> - You're kidding.<br> - Come on.<br> - Do you remember Dr Day?<br> - How do you do, Doctor?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Oh, well, then you must be Doctor...<br> - Luther.<br> - Luther. Yes, of course. I should have known.<br> - You mean you have heard of me?<br> - Yes, through both Eve White and Eve Black.<br> Not unfavourably, I trust.<br> On the contrary. They think<br> very highly of you, both of them.<br> Are we to understand...?<br> This is a little awkward, but are we to<br> understand that you're no longer Mrs White?<br> - No, l'm not.<br> - Nor Eve Black?<br> - No.<br> - Then may I ask, what is your name?<br> I don't know.<br> You do know Mrs White and Miss Black,<br> don't you?<br> I know them in a way.<br> I don't think I know them very well.<br> But you know they're...<br> Yes, I understand that.<br> It's a pretty bewildering thing, too, isn't it?<br> I should say you were well within your rights<br> in so describing the situation.<br> And may I add, it seems to grow<br> no less so with the passage of time.<br> - I wish I understood it better.<br> - How long...?<br> It's not easy to phrase these questions<br> without sounding like an idiot,<br> but how long have you,<br> well, been around?<br> I don't know. But I don't think<br> it could have been very long.<br> - What do you know about Mrs White?<br> - Oh, what about Jane?<br> - Jane who?<br> - I mean, for my name. Jane.<br> Why Jane?<br> Why not?<br> And so now Dr Luther had<br> three inadequate personalities<br> to complicate and confuse his search<br> for one stable and complete woman,<br> all of whom continued to live, so to speak,<br> their own separate lives.<br> Which would it be?<br> The rollicking and irresponsible playgirl?<br> Hey, you cut that out.<br> - I don't even know your first name.<br> - Ernie.<br> Ernie! (laughs)<br> The defeated wife?<br> Hill Brothers. Yes, sir, just a minute.<br> Hill Brothers.<br> - Hill Brothers.<br> - Thank you for waiting.<br> What? Well, just keep your britches on,<br> sugarfoot. l'll get your party for you.<br> Let me figure out which one it is.<br> OK, that it?<br> What? Well, who are you?<br> Well, honey, you're not the right one.<br> No, get off the line, you're not...<br> Look, I don't care who you are.<br> Blast off, buster.<br> Or the pleasant young woman<br> who had no memory?<br> What, in short, had nature, in the first place,<br> intended this woman to be?<br> - Not yet, Janie.<br> - What's the use, Earl?<br> You did say you loved me, didn't you?<br> Yes, I did.<br> Well, then, is it fair to say you love me but<br> can't marry me, without telling me why not?<br> - I just can't. I know it isn't fair. I just can't.<br> - What is it, honey?<br> l'm not gonna let you get away with<br> anything like this. You've got to tell me.<br> Please, Earl.<br> Just don't ask me any more. Please.<br> l'm sorry, Janie, l've got to.<br> I can't give you up<br> without even knowing what's the matter.<br> All right, then. l'll tell you.<br> Did you read in the newspaper about a month<br> ago about a multiple-personality case?<br> A woman that has three personalities?<br> - In The Chronicle?<br> - Yes, that's the one.<br> - Yeah, I read it. What about it?<br> - l'm that woman.<br> You're the...<br> That's right.<br> But you sound all right.<br> - Do I?<br> - You sound fine.<br> Maybe I do, but not the other two.<br> Other two?<br> Sure. There are two others, you know,<br> and they're very different from me.<br> And I don't even ever know<br> when they're coming out.<br> Holy Moses.<br> - So that's all there is to it.<br> - Oh, no, it isn't.<br> - Oh, please.<br> - Not by a long shot.<br> What I mean is, that doesn't scare me.<br> I feel just exactly the same.<br> Exactly as I felt before.<br> I love you just exactly the same.<br> Maybe even more.<br> Whatever it is, we can handle it together.<br> Earl, don't you understand?<br> It's not you marrying me.<br> It's me marrying anybody.<br> l'm sick. I am mentally sick<br> and I cannot marry anybody, ever.<br> Then, on the afternoon<br> of September 17th, 1953,<br> Mrs White came to the office<br> for her regular treatment<br> and died there.<br> How are you, Mrs White?<br> I don't feel very well.<br> Let's go inside and talk it over, shall we?<br> You look tired.<br> Yes, l'm very tired.<br> I seem to be tired all the time now.<br> Has the lively Miss Black<br> been keeping you out late?<br> Yes, sir, I guess so.<br> Anyway, I seem to be forgettin'<br> more than ever now.<br> Well, that could also be Jane, you know.<br> Yes, sir. I know.<br> What do you think of Jane?<br> Well, from what you've told me,<br> I hope she'll be the one.<br> - The one to what?<br> - To live.<br> Is that what you think is going to happen?<br> That two of you will eventually disappear?<br> Don't you?<br> Well, I have thought so at times.<br> Well, that's what I think.<br> And I think it'll be Jane.<br> At least, I hope so.<br> Did you go up Sunday to see Bonnie?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Did you have fun with her?<br> I did for a while.<br> Then I forgot for a while.<br> Then I came back again, before I left.<br> Then, when I was saying goodbye to Bonnie,<br> she said to me 'Don't come back that other<br> way, Mommy. I don't like that other way.'<br> Eve Black?<br> I guess when I was up there last month<br> she must have come out,<br> and she must have been cross with Bonnie<br> or slapped her or somethin'.<br> But then she said "Come back this way,<br> Mommy. The way you are now."<br> So I knew that it must have been Jane<br> that came out this time when I forgot.<br> And she was sweet to Bonnie.<br> But then when Papa<br> was driving me out of the yard,<br> I got the strangest feeling that<br> I wasn't ever gonna see her again,<br> that this was the last time.<br> And I wanted to jump out of that truck<br> and go hug her.<br> Try to explain to her and try to tell her...<br> But I don't know.<br> How do you explain to a little girl?<br> How do you make her understand that<br> her real mommy ain't never coming back,<br> but another woman who just looks like her?<br> Why do you think<br> you'll be one of the ones to go?<br> It's just the way I feel, I guess.<br> I don't really mind. Not any more.<br> l'm not fit for her now.<br> l'm not fit for anything, really. I know that.<br> But if it's Jane...<br> If she'll just understand how much<br> our little girl needs love and understanding,<br> then I won't mind dyin'.<br> You know, if she'll just<br> take good care of her for me.<br> - May I speak to Jane now, please?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Jane?<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> It was me that came out on Sunday.<br> And while I was there,<br> a curious thing happened<br> that I think you might be interested in.<br> What was that?<br> Well...<br> Well, it was this.<br> Bonnie and her mother<br> were out in the back yard.<br> They were playing ball.<br> You know, bouncing a ball back and forth.<br> Now, are you ready? All right.<br> Here it comes.<br> - Very good.<br> - Do it again, Mommy.<br> OK, here we go.<br> Uh-oh.<br> - Look, it's under the house.<br> - That's all right, honey. l'll get it.<br> You wait here, darling.<br> Mother will get it for you.<br> Can you see it?<br> Then, when I got under there,<br> a strange thing happened.<br> Suddenly, I was littler.<br> I was a little girl under the house.<br> I could smell the odour of fresh earth,<br> like a long time ago.<br> And morning glories, though there are no<br> morning glories growing around there now.<br> And you still can't remember<br> anything at all about your childhood?<br> No, not even of being a child.<br> Do you think Eve White<br> might be able to remember it?<br> - I have no idea.<br> - May I speak with her, please?<br> Mrs White?<br> Jane tells me that<br> when she came out up there on Sunday,<br> when you were playing catch with Bonnie,<br> the ball rolled under the house<br> and she went under after it.<br> And when she got under there,<br> she had a feeling of being very small.<br> A child.<br> A very curious and somehow frightening<br> feeling, as if she'd been there before.<br> Now, this had some meaning for her.<br> Can you remember, when you were very little,<br> any experience like that of any kind?<br> No, sir.<br> Will you think back to when you were five or<br> six or seven years old, something like that?<br> No, sir, I can't remember<br> anything like that under the house.<br> Perhaps under hypnosis?<br> Would you mind?<br> No, sir. I don't mind.<br> Will you close your eyes, please? Relax.<br> One...<br> Two...<br> Three.<br> Now, I want you to think back<br> to when you were five years old.<br> Just a little girl on the farm.<br> A very little girl<br> playing around the house in the back yard.<br> Sometimes you play<br> under the house, don't you?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Did you ever go under the house for a ball?<br> - I don't remember.<br> - Was it dark under the house?<br> - Yes, sir, very dark.<br> - Did it scare you?<br> No, sir.<br> All right. Now you're six.<br> Six years old.<br> You're still playing around the house.<br> The back yard.<br> You still go under the house sometimes?<br> Yes.<br> Now, can you remember one particular time<br> when something happened to you<br> when you were under there?<br> I don't want to, please...<br> Did a ball go under the house?<br> I want my cup...<br> First give me my blue china cup.<br> I want my cup.<br> I don't want to.<br> I don't like all those flowers.<br> Please, I don't want to.<br> Mama, please, I don't want to.<br> There's too many people.<br> Please... Mama, don't make me.<br> Mama, please, don't make...<br> - Mrs White?<br> - What were you doin' to her?<br> - Eve?<br> - Of course. What are you tryin' to get at?<br> l'll tell you. l'm interested in something that<br> Jane told me about being under the house,<br> your mother's house, probably<br> when you were about six years old.<br> It upset Mrs White very much.<br> Can you remember what it was?<br> - I didn't pay much attention to anything then.<br> - You came out then, didn't you?<br> Yeah. Only when I wanted to do<br> something she didn't want to do.<br> Didn't she ever tell you about all those<br> lickings she got for things she didn't do?<br> What are you doing out here now?<br> I didn't call you.<br> I don't know. I just had to, I guess.<br> Do you remember anything<br> about a blue china cup?<br> I don't remember anything like that.<br> How long is this gonna go on?<br> Until we find out what's the trouble,<br> of course.<br> - How long do you think that's gonna be?<br> - I have no idea.<br> You know what I think?<br> What?<br> I think l'm not havin' much fun any more.<br> You're still getting out, aren't you?<br> Not like I used to.<br> Is it Jane that's doin' that to me?<br> I don't know. What do you think?<br> I wish I knew more about her.<br> What do you want to know about her?<br> I don't know. It's not like it used to be,<br> when I knew all about Eve White<br> and she didn't know anything about me.<br> That's the way I liked it.<br> - It's all changed now, hasn't it?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Now there's Jane.<br> Yeah.<br> Do you like her?<br> Very much.<br> - More than you do me?<br> - I don't like anybody more than I do you.<br> You never would go out<br> and have a good time with me, would you?<br> A psychiatrist can't go out with a patient.<br> That's against the rules.<br> Would you go out with me<br> if you wasn't a doctor?<br> Anytime you'd let me.<br> Does she know all about what I do?<br> Does she tell you?<br> When I ask her.<br> Like about that sergeant?<br> - Yes, she told me about that.<br> - That's what I mean.<br> Somebody around all the time,<br> telling on you.<br> - You tell me about Mrs White, don't you?<br> - Yeah, but she don't do anything.<br> You know somethin', Doc?<br> What?<br> You remember that red dress?<br> The low-cut one?<br> How could I forget it?<br> I want you to have it.<br> A low-cut dress, for me?<br> I want you to have it if anything happens.<br> What do you mean, if anything happens?<br> Something's the matter.<br> I don't know what it is,<br> but something's the matter.<br> You don't think we're ever<br> going to get well, do you?<br> Of course I do.<br> Well, I don't.<br> I think we're gonna die, all of us.<br> Eve.<br> - You didn't think I could cry, did you?<br> - You never have before.<br> You know, I remember<br> the first time I ever saw you.<br> You was the first one I ever said who I was.<br> First one ever knew me.<br> You liked that red dress, didn't you?<br> Very much indeed.<br> I think it's a beautiful dress.<br> Well, I want you to have it.<br> Cos you're the only one that knows<br> what it's meant to me. The only one.<br> I know of nothing<br> that's gonna happen to you,<br> but I do appreciate the dress, believe me.<br> Now, may I speak to Jane?<br> - Of course.<br> - Jane?<br> Goodbye, Doc.<br> Goodbye, Eve.<br> Jane?<br> Yes.<br> What do you think she meant?<br> I don't know.<br> Have you remembered about<br> that blue china cup? Or under the house?<br> - No.<br> - Mrs White?<br> No!<br> No, Mama! Mama, please don't make me!<br> Please, please, please!<br> Please don't make me,<br> Mama, please! Please don't...<br> - Jane?<br> - Please, please!<br> - What happened, Jane, under the house?<br> - She made me kiss her!<br> She made me kiss her!<br> Mama, please!<br> (children chant) l'll beat you! l'll beat you!<br> - l'll beat you!<br> - l'll beat you!<br> Evie! Evie?<br> - Come on, sugar, time to get your clothes on.<br> - l'll be there in a minute, Mama.<br> Come on, Evie. I don't want to<br> come in there after you.<br> You come on this minute, do you hear?<br> You've got to kiss Grandma goodbye.<br> Then you won't miss her so much<br> if you kiss her goodbye, sugar pie.<br> You know that.<br> Please don't make me.<br> I don't want to. Oh, Papa.<br> Evie, darling. Evie,<br> you do like your mommy says.<br> Come on, now, you give her to me.<br> I know, sugar. All you've got to do is kiss her.<br> - Don't make me, please.<br> - Then you won't miss her so much.<br> - Mama, I don't want to, Mama.<br> - You've got to kiss her goodbye.<br> I don't want to. Please, Mama.<br> (sobs) Please, please! I don't want to.<br> Kiss her goodbye,<br> so you won't miss her so much.<br> (screams hysterically)<br> She didn't mean any wrong by it.<br> It was just the way<br> people thought in those days.<br> If you kissed the dead face, it was a sweet<br> goodbye and you wouldn't miss her so much.<br> That's all she meant.<br> Do you think a great deal about death now?<br> No.<br> Just that...<br> "Life's a city full of straying streets,<br> and death's the marketplace<br> where each one meets."<br> Just that. Someday, it'll happen.<br> Who wrote that? That poem?<br> - Shakespeare, wasn't it?<br> - Where did you learn it?<br> In high school.<br> Mr Montgomery recited it to us one day.<br> - Who was Mr Montgomery?<br> - The English teacher.<br> Who was your first teacher? Your very first,<br> when you first started going to school?<br> That was in Fortsville. Miss Bates.<br> In the second grade?<br> Miss Bates in the first grade.<br> Miss Griffith in the second grade.<br> Miss Stewart in the third grade.<br> And... and then we moved to Richmond and<br> we had Miss Patterson in the fourth grade.<br> Do you remember all of them?<br> - May I say 'em?<br> - Go on.<br> And in Richmond, we lived on Fifth Street.<br> Right next door to the Thompsons.<br> Rick and Mary Lou Thompson.<br> And... and Mr Thompson worked<br> at the railroad, in the machine shop.<br> Because I remember one Sunday<br> he took us all down to look at the machines.<br> Rick and Mary Lou and Florence and myself.<br> Florence is my cousin.<br> - I remember.<br> - May I speak to Mrs White?<br> - Do you have to?<br> - Mrs White?<br> She's gone.<br> Eve?<br> - They're gone.<br> - Eve Black?<br> They're gone, I tell you. Both of them.<br> They're gone and there's<br> nobody else here but me.<br> I know it. I can feel it.<br> And I can remember.<br> I can remember everything.<br> Mama and Papa and Bonnie...<br> I can remember.<br> Oh, I can remember, I can remember.<br> That was in the fall of 1953.<br> On September 17th, 1955,<br> Dr Luther received a special-delivery<br> airmail letter from Richmond, Virginia.<br> (Jane) "Dear Dr Luther,<br> Do you remember what today is? "<br> "It's the second anniversary<br> of that day in your office,<br> and still no more Eve White<br> and no more Eve Black."<br> "That's why we decided it was safe<br> at last to have Bonnie with us."<br> "And so here we all are, Earl and Bonnie<br> and me, going home together."<br> Marisa Castle de Joncaire<br>
