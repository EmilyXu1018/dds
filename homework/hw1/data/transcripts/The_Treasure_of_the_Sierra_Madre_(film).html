                        Say, buddy, will you stake a fellow ?<br> Hey, mister, will you stake<br> a fellow American to a meal?<br> - State lottery, senor? - Beat it.<br> I ain't buying no lottery tickets.<br> - Four thousand pesos, it's a big prize.<br> - Get away from me, you little beggar.<br> The whole ticket is only 4 pesos.<br> It's a sure winner.<br> I ain't got 4 pesos.<br> Buy a quarter of a ticket<br> for 1 peso silver.<br> If you don't get away from me, I'm gonna<br> throw this water right in your face.<br> Then one-tenth of a ticket,<br> senor, for 40 <br> Senor, buy one-twentieth. One-<br> twentieth costs you only 20 centavos.<br> Look, senor, add the figures up.<br> You get 13.<br> What better number could you buy?<br> It's a sure winner.<br> - Yeah, well, how soon's the drawing?<br> - Only three weeks off.<br> Give me a twentieth so I don't<br> have to look at your ugly face.<br> Es un numero excelente,<br> senor. Gracias.<br> Come again next time.<br> I always have the winners,<br> all the lucky numbers. Good luck.<br> Thirteen? Heh, heh.<br> Excuse me.<br> Cigarette?<br> Thanks.<br> - Ah, it's hot.<br> - Yeah.<br> What a town, Tampico.<br> You said it, brother. If I could get a job<br> that'd bring enough to buy passage ...<br> I'd shake its dust off<br> my feet soon enough.<br> Yeah.<br> If I was a native, I'd get me a can<br> of shoe polish and I'd be in business.<br> They'd never let a gringo.<br> You can sit on a bench till<br> you're three-quarters starved.<br> You can beg from another gringo,<br> you can even commit burglary.<br> You try shining shoes in the street ...<br> or peddling lemonade out of a<br> bucket and your hash is settled.<br> Never get another job<br> from an American.<br> Yeah, and the natives would<br> hound and pester you to death.<br> - Some town to be broke in.<br> - What town isn't?<br> Hey, um, can you stake a<br> fellow American to a meal?<br> Hey, mister.<br> Will you stake a fellow<br> American to a meal?<br> Such impudence never came my way.<br> Earlier this afternoon I gave you money.<br> Having my shoes polished,<br> I gave you more.<br> Now you put the bite on me again.<br> Do me a favor.<br> Go occasionally to somebody else.<br> - This is beginning to get tiresome.<br> - Excuse me. I never knowed it was you.<br> I never looked at your face, just<br> your hands and the money you gave.<br> Beg pardon. I promise I'll<br> never put the bite on you again.<br> This is the last you get from me.<br> Just to make sure you don't forget<br> your promise, here's another peso.<br> - Thanks, mister, thanks.<br> - But from now on ...<br> you have to make your way through<br> life without my assistance.<br> Hey, buddy, will you stake<br> a fellow American to a meal?<br> I won't give you a red cent.<br> But if you wanna make some<br> money, I'll give you a job.<br> - What's the catch?<br> - No catch.<br> I got a job if you want.<br> It's hard work, but good pay.<br> - You ever rig a camp?<br> - Sure.<br> The ferry's making off,<br> one of my men hasn't shown up.<br> I don't know what's happened.<br> He's probably drunk.<br> - What's the pay?<br> - Eight bucks American a day.<br> Well, don't just stand there. Make up<br> your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.<br> - I'm your man.<br> - Come on.<br> - Hello there.<br> - Hello yourself.<br> Okay, you guys, get aboard.<br> Take it your way.<br> What's the matter with you two?<br> Can't you take it?<br> Well, it's 130 in the shade, and there<br> ain't any shade up there on that derrick.<br> Just figure you're a couple of million-<br> aires in your own private steam bath.<br> And the sooner we're through ...<br> the sooner we'll be back in town<br> drinking cold beer.<br> We finish within two weeks,<br> I'm giving you fellas a bonus.<br> Yeah, it's coming to us working<br> Don't go crying. What do you want?<br> I'm paying top salaries and a bonus.<br> How about our pay?<br> And when do we get it?<br> - I ain't seen a buck out of you yet.<br> - You'll get your dough, all right ...<br> don't worry about that,<br> when we get back to Tampico.<br> What could you do with money out here<br> anyway, except gamble and lose it?<br> You'll be paid as we<br> step off the ferry.<br> An agent was to be here with the dough.<br> Don't know what could've happened.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> I'll go and pick up the money.<br> You men stay here.<br> Any objection to a couple<br> of us coming with you?<br> Don't you trust me?<br> You think I'd run out on you?<br> I don't think you'd do that.<br> But I ain't got a cent, not even<br> enough to buy me a glass of beer.<br> Say, you two guys meet me<br> over at the Cantina Madrid.<br> It's a quarter of 2 now and I'll<br> be over there no later than 3:00.<br> Pat McCormick, si.<br> He come in from time to time.<br> I no see him lately.<br> Pat McCormick?<br> What about Pat McCormick?<br> - Supposed to meet us here.<br> - Does he owe you money?<br> Yeah.<br> Say, how long you guys<br> been around Tampico, anyway?<br> What's that got to do with it?<br> Only foreigners and half-baked<br> Americans fall for McCormick's tricks.<br> How do you mean?<br> I mean he hires dumb guys<br> like you to work for him.<br> When it comes time to pay off,<br> he takes a powder.<br> How much we got left<br> of that 10 he gave us, Dobbsie?<br> - Two-fifty. - That's not<br> even enough for one bed.<br> I know a joint that's full of<br> rats, scorpions and cockroaches.<br> The cots are only<br> Jobs that were a dime a dozen<br> ain't to be had at all.<br> Streets are full of guys ...<br> pushing each other for a meal.<br> Gold in Mexico? Sure there is.<br> Not 10 days from here by rail.<br> There's a mountain waiting for<br> the right guy to come along ...<br> and discover her treasure.<br> The question is:<br> Are you the right guy?<br> Real bonanzas are few and far<br> between. They take a lot of finding.<br> Answer me this, will you? Why is<br> gold worth 20 bucks an ounce?<br> I don't know.<br> Because it's scarce.<br> A thousand men go<br> searching for gold.<br> After six months one of them's<br> lucky. One out of the thousand.<br> His find represents not only his own<br> labor but that of 999 others to boot.<br> That's, uh, 6,000 months, 500 years ...<br> scrambling over mountain,<br> going hungry and thirsty.<br> The gold is worth what it is because of<br> the human labor that went into finding it.<br> - Never thought of it like that.<br> - There's no other explanation.<br> Gold ain't good for nothing except<br> for making jewelry and gold teeth.<br> Gold's a devilish sort of thing.<br> You start out, you tell yourself you'll<br> be satisfied with 25,000 worth of it.<br> So help me Lord and cross my heart.<br> Fine resolution.<br> After months of sweating, growing<br> short on provisions and finding nothing ...<br> you finally come down to 15,000,<br> then 10.<br> Finally you say, "Lord, let me<br> just find $5,000 worth.<br> I'll never ask for anything<br> more the rest of my life."<br> Five thousand dollars<br> is a lot of money.<br> In this joint it seems like a lot.<br> If you was to make a real strike,<br> you couldn't be dragged away.<br> Not even death would keep you<br> from trying to add 10,000 more.<br> Ten, you'd wanna get 25.<br> Twenty-five, you'd wanna get 50.<br> Fifty, 100. Like roulette.<br> One more turn, you know?<br> Always one more.<br> It wouldn't be that way with me.<br> I swear, it wouldn't.<br> I'd take only what I set out to get.<br> Even if there was half-a-million dollars'<br> worth lying around waiting to be picked up.<br> I've dug in Alaska<br> and Canada and Colorado.<br> I was in the British Honduras,<br> I made my fare back home ...<br> and almost enough<br> to cure me of the fever I'd caught.<br> Dug in California and Australia.<br> All over the world practically.<br> Yeah. I know what gold<br> does to men's souls.<br> You talk as though you struck<br> it rich sometime, pop.<br> How about it?<br> Then what are you doing<br> in here, a down-and-outer?<br> That's gold.<br> That's what it makes us.<br> Never knew a prospector<br> yet that died rich.<br> Make one fortune, he's sure to<br> blow it trying to find another.<br> I'm no exception to the rule.<br> Ah, sure, I'm a gnawed old bone now, but<br> don't you guys think the spirit's gone.<br> I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe anytime<br> anybody's willing to share expenses.<br> I'd rather go myself.<br> Going alone is best.<br> But you gotta have a stomach for<br> loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.<br> Going with a partner is dangerous.<br> Murder is always lurking about.<br> Partners accusing each other<br> of all sorts of crimes.<br> As long as there's no find,<br> the noble brotherhood will last.<br> But when the piles of gold begin to<br> grow, that's when the trouble starts.<br> Now, I wouldn't mind a little<br> of that kind of trouble.<br> I think I'll go to sleep<br> and dream about piles of gold ...<br> getting bigger and bigger and bigger.<br> Do you believe what that old man who was<br> doing all the talking at the Oso Negro ...<br> said the other night ...<br> about gold changing a man's soul<br> so's he ain't the same kind of a guy ...<br> that he was before finding it?<br> Guess that all depends on the man.<br> That's exactly what I say.<br> Gold don't carry any curse with it.<br> It all depends on whether or not the<br> guy who finds it is the right guy.<br> The way I see it ...<br> gold can be as much of<br> a blessing as a curse.<br> - Hey, uh, Dobbsie?<br> - Yeah.<br> Look who's coming out<br> of the Hotel Bristol.<br> Is that Pat McCormick<br> or am I seeing things?<br> It's him.<br> - Let's get him.<br> - Let's get him hard.<br> Why don't you and me<br> go and buy me shopping things?<br> For instance, I could<br> use a new pair of shoes.<br> Hello, fellas, how are you?<br> Glad to see you.<br> - Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Curtin,<br> Senorita ... - Lopez.<br> Lopez. I want you fellas to<br> come and have a drink with me.<br> I have business with these gentlemen.<br> You go back up to the hotel<br> and wait, huh? I won't be long.<br> Okay.<br> Let's have that drink. Where you been?<br> I've been looking all over for you.<br> Three shots of rye.<br> Make mine brandy, Three Star.<br> - Two brandies.<br> - Rye is good enough for me.<br> I suppose you're wondering<br> about that money that's coming to you.<br> The fact is I haven't been paid<br> off on that contract yet myself.<br> If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.<br> I'll put you both on my next contract.<br> It'll come through Monday,<br> we set out Friday.<br> Here's to mud in your eye.<br> We want what's coming to us<br> and we want it right now.<br> - Didn't I get through telling you ?<br> - Better come across.<br> Well, boys, I'll tell you what<br> I'll do. I'll give you 25 percent.<br> I guess I can make it 30 percent.<br> The balance, the middle of next week?<br> Right here and now.<br> Every cent or you won't walk out<br> of here. You'll be carried out.<br> Let's don't stop being friends.<br> How about another drink?<br> Two more brandies.<br> Put the bottle on the bar.<br> If you got ideas<br> about getting us liquored ...<br> Oh, no, I'm just inviting you<br> to have a friendly drink with me.<br> - I'm licked, boys, I'm licked.<br> - Give us our money.<br> Yeah, give us our money.<br> I can't see.<br> Fifty, 100, 200 ...<br> three hundred.<br> - That's it, ain't it, Curt?<br> - Yeah, that's it.<br> Let's beat it before the law arrives.<br> Here's for the drinks<br> and the use of the cantina.<br> - You know something, Curt?<br> - What?<br> We ain't very smart, hanging<br> around Tampico waiting for a job.<br> Money's getting shorter every day ...<br> and soon we're right back<br> where we were, on the bum again ...<br> pushing guys for dimes and<br> sleeping around in freight cars.<br> That's right. Got any ideas?<br> Yeah.<br> That old man in the Oso Negro<br> started me to thinking.<br> What about?<br> Why not try gold-digging<br> for a change?<br> It ain't any riskier than<br> waiting around here for a break ...<br> and this is the country where<br> the nuggets are crying for you ...<br> to take them out of the ground,<br> make them shining coins ...<br> on the fingers and necks<br> of swell dames.<br> One thing, living in the open is<br> cheaper than it is here in Tampico.<br> Our money would last longer.<br> The longer it lasts, the greater our<br> chance of digging something up would be.<br> We'd have to have equipment, all right.<br> Picks and spades, pans, burros.<br> Wonder how much it would all cost.<br> - That old man would know.<br> - Yeah, he could give us some pointers.<br> He's too old to take along.<br> We'd have to pack him on our backs.<br> You can't tell about some<br> of those old guys.<br> It's surprising sometimes<br> how tough they are.<br> I don't know what gold<br> looks like in the ground.<br> I've only seen it in jewelry-store<br> windows and people's mouths.<br> You know anything about prospecting?<br> Uh ... Not much,<br> when you come right down to it.<br> We might have use for an<br> experienced guy like that old-timer.<br> Let's go hunt him up right away.<br> Will I go? Heh. Well, what a<br> question. Of course I'll go.<br> Any time, any day, I was<br> waiting for two guys to ask me.<br> Out for gold?<br> I'm always at your service.<br> I got 300 bucks ready cash in the bank.<br> Two hundred, I'm all set to invest.<br> Last money I got.<br> When that's gone, I'm finished.<br> If you don't take a risk,<br> can't make a gain.<br> - How much dough you guys got to put in?<br> - I got 150 bucks and Curtin's got the same.<br> Five hundred ain't enough to buy tools,<br> weapons and essential provisions.<br> - What do we need weapons for?<br> - Meat's one thing and bandits another.<br> Bandit country's where we'd be going.<br> We ought to have 600 between us.<br> - That much, eh?<br> - Can't you dig up any more?<br> - Not a red cent.<br> - Senor.<br> Senor! Give me my money, senor.<br> - Ten percent for selling the winning<br> ticket. - Get away from me, will you?<br> Please, senor. Whoever draws the<br> lucky number gives a present to <br> I don't want any lottery ticket.<br> If you don't, you have bad<br> luck the rest of your life.<br> What? Wait a minute.<br> What did you first say?<br> He sold you the winning ticket.<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> This what you mean?<br> Si, senor.<br> - It's the winner?<br> - Two hundred peso prize.<br> Where?<br> - Hey, that's my number.<br> - Sure enough.<br> Just look at that fat,<br> rich printed number.<br> That's the kind of sugar<br> Poppa likes. Oh, 200 pesos.<br> Welcome, sweet little smackeroos.<br> Here, son, here's a present<br> for you with my blessing.<br> - Muchas gracias, senor.<br> Well, would you like to shake<br> the hand that bought that ticket?<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Congratulations, yourself.<br> - You profit out of this the same as<br> I do. - How do you make that out?<br> Didn't he just say we needed 600 bucks?<br> That's what we've got now, ain't it?<br> - Yeah, but <br> - But what?<br> - You're putting up for me?<br> - This is an all-or-nothing proposition.<br> If we make a find, we'll be<br> lighting our cigars with $100 bills.<br> If we don't, the difference<br> between what I put up ...<br> ain't enough to keep me<br> from being where I was:<br> Polishing a bench with my pants.<br> Put her there, part.<br> We'll buy our burros at Perla and<br> head northwest away from the railroad.<br> No use looking nearby a railroad,<br> or any kind of a road at all ...<br> because construction engineers examine<br> every bit of ground around the road ...<br> while they're building.<br> We go where there's no trails.<br> Where no surveyor or anybody who knows<br> anything about prospecting has been before.<br> The best place to go to ...<br> anybody works on a salary wouldn't go<br> because he wouldn't risk his hide.<br> I got three of them.<br> How many did you get?<br> - A couple.<br> - I'm one up. I bet I got more.<br> I got three. Nice shooting, eh?<br> Look at that hole two inches<br> from my head. That was close.<br> The bullets were flying thick and fast<br> in here. It sounded like a swarm of bees.<br> That bandit with the gold hat, I had<br> my sights on him, nice as you please.<br> The train gave a jolt and I missed.<br> Wish I'd got him.<br> Big boulder on the<br> track, so train stop.<br> Bandits get big surprise because<br> soldiers on the train waiting for them.<br> - Not many passengers get killed.<br> - Here's where we're bound for.<br> Don't show whether there's<br> mountain, swamp or desert.<br> That shows the makers<br> of the map don't know.<br> Once on the ground,<br> we open our eyes and look around.<br> Blow our noses too. Believe it<br> or not, I knew a fellow ...<br> who could smell gold like<br> a jackass can smell water.<br> What's all that about?<br> We're going into country<br> very wild and dangerous.<br> Have to cut through jungles and climb<br> mountains so high they rise above the clouds.<br> Tigers so big and strong they can climb<br> trees with burros in their mouths. Good.<br> Glad to hear such tall tales because that<br> means few outsiders have set foot there.<br> Well, let's get going.<br> Oh.<br> Hey.<br> If there was gold in them mountains,<br> how long would it have been there?<br> Millions and millions of years,<br> wouldn't it?<br> What's our hurry?<br> A couple of days more or less<br> ain't gonna make any difference.<br> Remember what you said<br> back in Tampico ...<br> about having to pack that<br> old man on our backs?<br> That was when I took him<br> for an ordinary human being ...<br> not part goat.<br> Look at him climb, will you?<br> What gets me is how he can go all day<br> long in the sun without any water.<br> Maybe he's part camel too.<br> If I'd known what prospecting meant ...<br> I'd have stayed in Tampico and<br> waited for another job to turn up.<br> - Hey.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Look.<br> - Look at it glitter.<br> It's yellow too, like - Like ...<br> Gold.<br> Howard. Howard. Howard! Howard.<br> Come back, we've found something.<br> Hey, look. Hey, look, Curt, there's<br> a vein of it here in this rock.<br> And look here. Look, it's all around.<br> What else could it be?<br> Only gold shines and<br> glitters like that.<br> We've struck it, Curt.<br> Look, from the looks of things ...<br> we've struck it rich.<br> - Look, it's all over here.<br> - We found What do you call it?<br> - Mother lode.<br> - Right.<br> Howard. Come on. Look. Look.<br> Here, look at this rock.<br> It's full of gold. Veins of it.<br> This wouldn't pay dinner<br> for a carload.<br> It ain't gold?<br> Pyrite. Fool's gold.<br> Not that there ain't<br> plenty of the real stuff.<br> Walked over it four or five times.<br> A place yesterday looked rich ...<br> but the water for washing<br> the sand was miles away.<br> The other places, there wasn't enough<br> gold to pay us a good day's wages.<br> Next time you strike<br> it rich, holler for me ...<br> before you start splashing water<br> around. Water's precious.<br> Sometimes it can be more precious<br> than gold.<br> Burro.<br> - What's up?<br> - Norther, looks like.<br> A "norther"? What's a "norther"?<br> Big winds from the north<br> this time of year.<br> When they blow hard, this desert country<br> stands right up on its hind legs.<br> There's only a few more miles<br> of this heavy stuff.<br> Pretty soon we'll be<br> out of this valley.<br> Hey, you fellas,<br> how about some beans?<br> You want some beans?<br> Going through some mighty rough country<br> tomorrow. You better have some beans.<br> You know what I'm thinking?<br> I'm thinking we ought to give up ...<br> leave the whole outfit ...<br> everything behind.<br> Go back to civilization.<br> What's that you say? Go back? Ha, ha!<br> Well, tell my old grandmother.<br> I got two bedfellows who kick<br> at the first drop of rain ...<br> and hide when thunder rumbles.<br> My, my, my. What great prospectors.<br> Two shoe clerks reading<br> about prospecting for gold ...<br> south of the border<br> or west of the Rockies.<br> Shut your trap. Shut up<br> or I'll smash your head flat.<br> Go ahead, throw it. If you did, you'd<br> never leave this wilderness alive.<br> You two would die here<br> more miserable than rats.<br> Oh, leave him alone.<br> Can't you see the old man's nuts?<br> Nuts? Nuts, am I? Let me tell you<br> something, my two fine bedfellows.<br> You're so dumb, there's<br> nothing to compare.<br> Dumber than the dumbest jackass.<br> Look at each other.<br> Ever see anything like<br> yourself for specimens?<br> You're so dumb ...<br> you don't see the riches<br> you're treading on.<br> Don't expect to find<br> nuggets of molten gold.<br> It's not that rich.<br> Here ain't the place to dig.<br> It comes from someplace<br> further up. Up there.<br> Up there's where we<br> got to go. Up there.<br> - Is that it?<br> - That's it, all right.<br> - Gold, I mean.<br> - Yeah.<br> Sure don't look like<br> I thought it would.<br> - Not much different from sand.<br> - Yeah. It's just like plain sand.<br> - It don't glitter.<br> - It will when it's refined.<br> Some other guy's job.<br> All we got to do is mine it<br> and get it back there.<br> Gold ain't like stones in a riverbed.<br> It don't cry out to be picked up. Ha.<br> You got to know how to recognize it.<br> And finding ain't all. Not by a long shot.<br> Got to tickle her so<br> she'll come out laughing.<br> Yeah, it's mighty rich.<br> It'll pay good.<br> - How good?<br> - Oh, about 20 ounces to the ton.<br> - That's $20 an ounce.<br> - How many tons can we handle a week?<br> Depends on how hard we work.<br> We better pitch our camp<br> down the mountainside.<br> Why, when the digging's here?<br> Anybody happens by, we can<br> tell them we're hunters.<br> - Wouldn't it be easier to file a claim?<br> - Easier, but not so profitable.<br> An emissary from one of those<br> big companies would be here ...<br> with a paper in his hand<br> showing we had no right to be here.<br> Yeah. Well?<br> How does it feel to you fellas<br> to be men of property?<br> Huh.<br> The tanks will leak at first ...<br> till the boards begin to<br> swell and close the seams.<br> I sure had some cockeyed ideas<br> about prospecting for gold.<br> It was all in the finding,<br> I thought. Ha, ha.<br> Thought all you had to do was find<br> it, pick it up, put it in sacks ...<br> and carry them to the nearest bank.<br> You're learning. I won't<br> be able to tell you a thing.<br> - Tank full yet?<br> - Right to the top.<br> Open the sluice gate.<br> How much do you figure it to be now?<br> Oh, about $5,000 worth, I reckon.<br> When are we going to<br> start dividing it up?<br> Anytime you say.<br> What's the use in dividing it<br> at all? I don't see any point.<br> We're all going back together<br> when the time comes.<br> Why not wait till we get paid<br> and then divide the money?<br> - Either way suits me. You fellows decide.<br> - I'm for dividing it up as we go along.<br> Make each guy responsible<br> for his own goods.<br> I'd just as soon have it that way.<br> I haven't liked the responsibility<br> of guarding your treasure.<br> Who asked you to?<br> Ha, ha. That's right.<br> You never asked me.<br> Only I thought I was the most<br> trustworthy of the three.<br> You? Ha! How come?<br> I said the most trustworthy. As far as<br> being the most honest, no one can say.<br> I don't get you.<br> Suppose you're charged<br> of taking care of the goods.<br> One day I'm deep in the brush and<br> Curtin's on his way to get provisions.<br> That'd be your chance to pack<br> up and leave us in the cold.<br> Only a guy that's a thief at heart would<br> think me likely to do a thing like that.<br> Right now<br> it wouldn't be worth your while ...<br> but when the pile's grown to 300 ounces,<br> think of such things you will.<br> How's about yourself?<br> Ha, ha. Oh, I'm not quick<br> on my feet any longer.<br> You're a lot tougher<br> than when we started out.<br> By the time the pile's grown to be tempting,<br> I won't be able to run as fast as you.<br> You'd get me and string<br> me up in no time.<br> That's why I think<br> I'm the most trustworthy.<br> Looking at it that way, you're right.<br> But maybe it would be a good idea ...<br> to cut the proceeds up<br> three ways every night.<br> Relieve you of a responsibility<br> you don't like.<br> Swell by me. After we got<br> a couple of hundred ounces ...<br> it'll be a nuisance<br> carrying bags from our necks.<br> Each of us will have to hide his share<br> of treasure from the other two.<br> Having done so, he'll have<br> to be forever on watch ...<br> that his hiding place's<br> not discovered.<br> What a dirty, filthy mind you've got.<br> Oh, no. Not dirty. Not dirty, baby.<br> Only I know what kind of ideas ...<br> even supposedly decent people<br> get when gold's at stake.<br> All right.<br> Here she goes three ways.<br> Dobbs.<br> Howard. Howard. Howard.<br> Howard, come quick.<br> He's coming around.<br> Lay still a minute till<br> you get your senses back.<br> What happened?<br> Part of the mine caved in on you.<br> Got a knock on the head.<br> No bones broken?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> - Who pulled me out?<br> - Curtin did.<br> I owe my life to you, partner.<br> Forget it.<br> What are you gonna do with your<br> money when we get back and cash in?<br> I'm getting along in years.<br> I can still hold up my end ...<br> when it comes to a hard day's work,<br> but I'm not the man I was once.<br> Next year, next month, next week, by<br> thunder, won't be the man I am today.<br> I'll settle down in a quiet place ...<br> get a little business,<br> hardware, grocery store ...<br> spend my time reading comic<br> strips and adventure stories.<br> One thing's for sure.<br> I'm not gonna go prospecting ...<br> waste time and money<br> to find another gold mine.<br> How about yourself?<br> What plans have you?<br> I figure on buying some land<br> and growing fruit. Peaches, maybe.<br> How did you come to<br> settle on peaches?<br> One summer, when I was a kid ...<br> I worked as a picker in a peach<br> harvest in the San Joaquin Valley.<br> Boy, it sure was something.<br> Hundreds of people, old and young.<br> Whole families working together.<br> At night, after a day's work ...<br> we used to build big bonfires and<br> sit around and sing to guitar music.<br> Till morning sometimes.<br> We'd go to sleep, wake up and<br> sing, and go to sleep again.<br> Everybody had a wonderful time.<br> Ever since, I've had a<br> hankering to be a grower.<br> It must be grand watching your<br> own trees put on leaves ...<br> come into blossom and bear.<br> Watching the fruit get big and<br> ripe on the boughs, ready for picking.<br> What's all that about?<br> We're telling each other<br> what we aim to do.<br> Oh!<br> Now me, I got it all figured<br> out what I'm gonna do.<br> Tell us about it, Dobbsie.<br> Well, first off, I'm going to a Turkish<br> bath and I'm gonna sweat and soak ...<br> till I get all the grime<br> and dirt out of my system.<br> Then I'm going to a haberdasher<br> and gonna get myself brand-new duds.<br> Dozen of everything.<br> Then I'm going to a swell cafe,<br> order everything on the bill of fare ...<br> and if it ain't just right,<br> or maybe even if it is ...<br> I'm gonna bawl the waiter out,<br> take the whole thing back.<br> What's next on the program?<br> Well, what would be?<br> I wouldn't talk or<br> even think about women.<br> Ain't good for your health.<br> Yeah, maybe you're right, seeing<br> as how the prospects are far off.<br> You know what?<br> We ought to put a limit on<br> our take, agree between us ...<br> when we get so much,<br> we pull up stakes.<br> - What do you think the limit ought<br> to be? - Say $25,000 apiece.<br> Twenty-five thousand?<br> Eh, small potatoes.<br> How much do you say?<br> Oh, 50,000 anyway,<br> Take a year, if the vein<br> held out. Wouldn't be likely.<br> What's a year more or less when<br> that kind of money is to be had?<br> Oh, 25,000 is plenty<br> as far as I'm concerned.<br> - Enough to last me the rest of my lifetime.<br> - Well, sure, you're old. I'm young.<br> I need dough and plenty of it.<br> Twenty-five thousand in one piece<br> is more than I ever expected to get.<br> - Small potatoes. - There's no<br> use making hogs of ourselves.<br> Hog, am I?<br> I'd be within my rights if I demanded<br> half again as much as you get.<br> How come?<br> There's no denying I put up<br> the lion's share of the cash.<br> So you did, Dobbsie,<br> and I always meant to pay you back.<br> In any civilized place the biggest investor<br> gets the biggest return, don't he?<br> Ha. That's one thing<br> in favor of the wilds.<br> Not that I intend to demand it, but<br> I'd be within my rights if I did.<br> Next time you call me a hog just remember<br> what I could've done if I'd wanted to.<br> It'd be wise not to put<br> things on a money basis.<br> Here you are, Dobbs.<br> What I owe you with interest.<br> I just don't like being<br> called a hog, that's all.<br> Better not jump out.<br> I might have let you have it.<br> Out for a midnight stroll?<br> Tiger around, I went<br> to see the burros.<br> - So?<br> - What's the matter, Dobbsie?<br> I think I'll see if the<br> burros are all right.<br> Go ahead. Help yourself.<br> - What's up?<br> - Nothing's up.<br> Where is Dobbs?<br> Poking around in the dark out there.<br> He's sure taking a<br> long time out there.<br> I think I'll go have a look-see.<br> Where's Curtin?<br> He's out there somewhere.<br> Said he was gonna have a look-see.<br> It's me again, but I<br> won't take my turn.<br> Stop worrying about your goods, go<br> to bed. We got work to do tomorrow.<br> Can't catch me sleeping.<br> Don't you ever believe that.<br> I'm not that dumb.<br> The day you try to put<br> anything over on me ...<br> it'll be a costly one for both of you.<br> Any more lip out of you and<br> I'll up and let you have it.<br> If you know what's good for you ...<br> you won't monkey around<br> with Fred C. Dobbs.<br> You ought to get a load of Dobbs.<br> He's talking to himself.<br> Something's eating him,<br> I don't know what.<br> He's just spoiling for trouble.<br> "We're running short<br> of provisions, Dobbsie.<br> How about you go into the village?"<br> Who does Howard think he is,<br> ordering me around?<br> What's that, Dobbs?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Look out.<br> It's a bad sign when a<br> guy talks to himself.<br> Yeah? Who else am I gonna talk to?<br> Certainly not you or Curtin.<br> - Fine partners you two are.<br> - Something up your nose?<br> Blow it out, it'll do you good.<br> Don't get the idea you two<br> are putting anything over.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - I know what your game is.<br> You know more than I do.<br> Why am I to go to the village<br> instead of you and Curtin?<br> Don't think I don't see through that.<br> You two have thrown together against me.<br> The two days I'd be gone would give you<br> time to discover where my goods are.<br> Fear along those lines,<br> take your goods with you.<br> And run the risk of having them<br> taken from me by bandits?<br> If you run into them,<br> you'd be out of luck anyway.<br> They'd kill you for<br> the shoes on your feet.<br> So that's it.<br> Everything's clear now.<br> You're hoping bandits will get me.<br> That would save you a lot<br> of trouble, wouldn't it?<br> Your consciences<br> wouldn't bother you none neither.<br> All right, Dobbs, forget about it.<br> Ah, just like I thought.<br> - What's the idea?<br> - Put your hands up.<br> I've a good mind to haul off and<br> pump you up, chest and belly alike.<br> You mind telling me<br> what this is about?<br> - It won't get you anywhere<br> playing dumb. - Well, I'll be.<br> - So that's where your goods are hidden.<br> - What's the trouble here?<br> Seems like I accidentally stumbled<br> on Dobbsie's treasure.<br> Accidentally? Why were you trying<br> to pry up that rock, tell me?<br> - I saw a Gila monster crawl under it.<br> - Brother, I gotta hand it to you.<br> You can certainly pick up a<br> good story when you need one.<br> Okay, I'm a liar. There isn't<br> a Gila monster under there.<br> Let's see you stick your hand<br> in and get your goods out.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Sure, I will.<br> But you try any bad moves <br> Don't worry. I'll stay right<br> where I am. I wanna see this.<br> Reach in and get your goods.<br> If you don't, we'll think you're<br> yellow, won't we, Howard?<br> They never let go, do they,<br> once they grab onto you?<br> You can cut them in two and the<br> head will still hang on till sundown.<br> By that time, the victim<br> doesn't care. He's dead.<br> - Isn't that right, Howard?<br> - I reckon.<br> Why don't you stick your<br> hand in, get your treasure?<br> Couldn't be because you're scared after<br> you've been shooting your mouth off?<br> Show us you ain't yellow.<br> I'd hate to think my partner<br> had a yellow streak up his back.<br> I'll kill you, you dirty, thieving ...<br> Okay, Howard, I got him covered.<br> Another bad move out of you<br> and I'll blow you to kingdom come.<br> Howard, turn that rock over, will you?<br> The Federales are very efficient.<br> Yeah. Bandidos, eh?<br> Yeah, seems between them<br> they had a diamond ring ...<br> pearl earrings, money ...<br> and a railway ticket with the date<br> of the Aguascalientes robbery on it.<br> They've been here several days,<br> drinking, shooting.<br> The villagers are afraid<br> to stick their noses out.<br> Where are they taking them now?<br> - The cemetery.<br> - Oh.<br> The Federales don't operate<br> in our American way.<br> They aren't fingerprint experts,<br> but they can follow any trail.<br> Against them,<br> no hideout is any use.<br> They know all the<br> tricks of the bandits.<br> Yeah, you can bet your sweet<br> soul they'll trace down ...<br> every last one of that group<br> that attacked the train.<br> It'll take time, months maybe,<br> but they'll do it.<br> Not many Americans get around this way.<br> You're the first one for a long time.<br> That so?<br> - Mighty rugged country hereabouts.<br> - Yeah.<br> My name's Cody.<br> - I'm from Texas.<br> - Curtin.<br> - What's your game?<br> - I'm a hunter.<br> - Professional?<br> - Yeah.<br> What all do you hunt?<br> Oh, tiger cats, anything<br> of commercial value.<br> - How long you been in these<br> mountains? - Oh, a few months.<br> Ever seen anything<br> that looked like pay dirt?<br> No.<br> I've a hunch there's loads of the<br> real goods up in those mountains.<br> No, I know<br> the whole landscape around here.<br> If there'd been gold,<br> I'd have seen it.<br> - There's nothing doing here for gold.<br> - I can look at a hill five miles away ...<br> and tell you whether it carries<br> an ounce or a shipload.<br> If you haven't found anything, I'll<br> come with you, put your nose in it.<br> There's indications in this<br> valley, lots of indications.<br> I find they come from that ridge up<br> there, washed down by the tropical rain.<br> - You don't say so.<br> - Yes, I say so.<br> So much for those bandits.<br> You gotta hand it to the Mexicans<br> when it comes to swift justice.<br> Once the Federales get their mitts on<br> a criminal they know just what to do.<br> Hand him a shovel, tell him<br> to dig. He's deep enough ...<br> they tell him to put the shovel down,<br> smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.<br> In another five minutes he's being<br> covered over with the earth he dug out.<br> Yeah, you gotta hand<br> it to them, all right.<br> I meant what I said about going along<br> with you. Those are my burros.<br> I'm ready to start, if you'll let<br> me go with you to your camp.<br> Thanks anyway, but I prefer<br> going it by myself.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Adios.<br> Burros.<br> Come on, burros.<br> I went way around, stayed on hard<br> ground which wouldn't show the tracks.<br> Every time I hit a high point and<br> looked, I could see he was still coming.<br> I guess it's only a matter<br> of time till he shows up here.<br> - I move we tell him straight off to<br> beat it. - Now, no, that'd be foolish.<br> He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent<br> and then report us to the officials.<br> We couldn't stay and we couldn't<br> take our goods with us when we left.<br> Nothing to do but pull the<br> trigger the minute he appears.<br> No crime to visit these mountains.<br> He might like to wander.<br> You can't shoot him for that.<br> If you were to shoot him<br> it might come out.<br> We don't have to shoot<br> him necessarily.<br> We can push him off one of them<br> rocks, claim it an accident.<br> Just who's gonna<br> do the pushing, you?<br> We'll toss for it.<br> You're sure he was<br> trailing you, are you?<br> - Absolutely.<br> - How come?<br> Because there he is.<br> Come over by the fire.<br> I know quite well I'm not wanted here.<br> But even after what you told me ...<br> I couldn't resist the desire<br> to sit and jaw with an American.<br> Why don't you go where Americans want<br> to talk to you? Durango isn't too far.<br> They got one of them<br> American clubs there.<br> I'm not after that.<br> I've got other things on<br> my mind, more important.<br> Uh-huh.<br> So do we. Don't make any mistakes.<br> Our biggest worry is your presence here.<br> We got no use for you.<br> We don't even want you<br> for a cook or a dishwasher.<br> No vacancies, understand?<br> In case I don't make myself clear,<br> you'll be doing yourself a favor ...<br> by packing up and<br> getting out tomorrow.<br> Go back where you came from.<br> Take our blessings with you.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Yeah.<br> Go ahead. Help yourself. We're no misers.<br> We don't let guys starve to death.<br> Tonight, you're our guest.<br> But tomorrow morning ...<br> look out, no trespassing around here.<br> You know, "Beware the dogs."<br> Get it?<br> I got myself five foxes and a lion<br> while you were away at the village.<br> - How are the hides?<br> - Pretty good.<br> - Where'd you hit them?<br> - Right through their eyes.<br> Excuse me for butting in, but there's<br> no game here worth going after.<br> Wouldn't take one week for a<br> hunter to clean up all around for ...<br> five miles in each direction.<br> Yes, there's no good hunting here.<br> That's why we made up our mind to<br> quit and look for something better.<br> Yes, you're dead right.<br> Awful poor ground.<br> It took us some time to find it out.<br> Poor ground, you say?<br> Depends on what you're looking for.<br> For game, yes.<br> - Mighty good ground for<br> something else. - Yeah?<br> Uh, what might that be?<br> Gold.<br> Gold?<br> That's a good one.<br> I told you in the village,<br> there's no gold here.<br> If there had been one ounce of it,<br> I'd have seen it, believe me.<br> If you haven't found any gold here,<br> you're not as smart as you appear.<br> Well, maybe. Maybe you're right.<br> Who knows?<br> We never thought about gold.<br> Gives me an idea.<br> Guess I'll sleep on it.<br> Well, I'll hit the hay.<br> Yeah. Me too.<br> Till in the morning, mister.<br> I can't figure this bird out.<br> Is he wise to us or isn't he?<br> Whether he is or not,<br> he looks fairly harmless to me.<br> - Yeah. Looks can be mighty<br> deceiving. - No denying that.<br> I'm keeping my boots on this night.<br> Might take it in his head<br> to murder us in our sleep.<br> - Anything can happen.<br> - Well, then?<br> I'll tell you what.<br> You guys go to sleep, I'll be<br> watchdog for a couple hours.<br> Then you can take your turns.<br> - Okay. Got your gun handy?<br> - Yeah. Right here.<br> Good morning, friend.<br> Where'd you get the water<br> to make coffee?<br> - I took it out of the olla.<br> - Did you?<br> We didn't carry that water here<br> for you to make coffee.<br> - I didn't know water was so<br> hard to get. - You know it now.<br> - I'll fill it up for you.<br> - What's up?<br> Well, I caught this<br> guy stealing our water.<br> The next time I'll let it out of<br> you through little round holes.<br> I thought I was among civilized men<br> who wouldn't begrudge me fresh water.<br> Who's not civilized?<br> I could easily do the same for you.<br> It's not settled yet<br> who'd come out on top.<br> This time I took it.<br> Thanks for your kind attention.<br> If I were you, stranger, I'd pack<br> up and go while the going's good.<br> I mean to stay right here.<br> The brush and the mountains<br> are free, aren't they?<br> Sure. That's right, to<br> whoever's first on the spot.<br> That holds for hunters,<br> not for gold miners.<br> - Unless they registered their claim.<br> - Who says we have a claim to register?<br> Whatever you say or don't say,<br> tomorrow I start to dig for gold.<br> I know you guys can bump<br> me off any minute ...<br> but that's a risk worth running<br> considering the stakes.<br> Lay our cards on the table.<br> As I see it, you guys have got<br> to do one of three things:<br> Kill me, run me off or take<br> me in with you as a partner.<br> Let's consider the first.<br> Another guy may come along.<br> Maybe a dozen other guys.<br> You start bumping people off,<br> how far are you prepared to go?<br> Ask yourselves that.<br> Also, don't forget, the one<br> actually to do the bumping off ...<br> would forever be in the power<br> of the other two.<br> The only safe way would be for all<br> of you to drag out your cannons ...<br> and bang away like a firing squad.<br> We wouldn't stop at anything<br> to protect our interests.<br> I claim killing me isn't it.<br> But, of course,<br> that's for you to decide.<br> As for choice number two.<br> You run me off, I might<br> very well inform on you.<br> We'd get you if you did that.<br> If we had to go all<br> the way to China.<br> Twenty-five percent of the value<br> of your find is the reward I'd get.<br> And that would be mighty<br> tempting. Mighty tempting.<br> - A strong argument in favor of<br> number one. - I don't deny it.<br> But let's see what number<br> three has to offer.<br> If you take me in as a partner,<br> you don't stand to lose anything.<br> I'll not share in what you've made<br> so far, only in profits to come.<br> What do you say?<br> Would you mind letting us talk<br> this over among ourselves?<br> Not at all. Go ahead. I have to<br> look after my burros anyway.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Sending him away is out.<br> We bump him off or<br> make him a partner.<br> Fred C. Dobbs ain't a guy<br> likes being taken advantage of.<br> Do the mug in, I say.<br> He told us how, didn't he?<br> All of us hold out our cannons<br> and let him have it.<br> What do we gain by bumping him off?<br> Asking to share in what we made,<br> it'd be different.<br> Don't mind being taken advantage of<br> so long as it isn't money out of pocket.<br> And whoever else happens along ...<br> they're to be invited in too.<br> Come one, come all, eh?<br> You got a point there, Dobbsie.<br> No question about that.<br> But, uh, killing ...<br> - What's the matter, ain't you<br> up to it? - Sure, I'm up to it.<br> Let the majority decide.<br> What's your vote, partner?<br> For or against?<br> For.<br> Okay.<br> Let's make it short<br> and sweet for him.<br> So it's number one, is it?<br> Better take a look down<br> that hill first.<br> I can't make out what they are.<br> They must be soldiers.<br> So that's your stinking game, is it?<br> Informing. I knew you was an<br> informer. I knew it all the time.<br> You're wrong.<br> This means all our funerals.<br> What's that?<br> If it's what I think it is,<br> may the Lord be with us.<br> They're not soldiers, they're<br> bandits. After guns and ammunition.<br> Someone must have told them<br> about the American hunter.<br> They don't look like soldiers to me,<br> either. That's what they are. Bandits.<br> We better start thinking<br> of a way to defend ourselves.<br> We might hide, but we'd lose<br> the burros, the whole outfit.<br> No, the best thing is<br> to make a fight of it.<br> You have good eyes. Stay on this<br> lookout and watch their movements.<br> Curtin, you round up the burros<br> and herd them in that thicket there.<br> Dobbs, let's you and me wrap up all our<br> belongings and dump them in the trench.<br> They're turning onto the trail.<br> - How many of them are there?<br> - About a dozen.<br> They'll be an hour so we<br> better have something to eat.<br> Come on down, friend.<br> Howard.<br> Look, Howard.<br> The one in the gold hat, remember?<br> The man from the train robbery.<br> They think whoever was here is gone.<br> Some want to go back down,<br> others want to stay ...<br> and use this site as headquarters<br> to raid the villages.<br> How about pouring it into them?<br> - Bumping off as many as we can, real<br> fast? - No, let's hold our horses.<br> Alto!<br> We are Federales.<br> - You know, the mounted police. - If<br> you're the police, where are your badges?<br> Badges? We ain't got no badges.<br> We don't need no badges.<br> I don't have to show you<br> any stinking badges.<br> Better not come any closer.<br> We didn't try to do you any harm.<br> Why don't you try to be<br> a little more polite?<br> Give us your gun and<br> we'll leave you in peace.<br> I need my gun myself.<br> Aw, throw that old iron over here.<br> We'll pick it up and go on our way.<br> You go anyway without<br> my gun, and go quick.<br> All right. All right.<br> Look here, amigo,<br> you got the wrong idea.<br> We don't want to get your gun<br> for nothing. We want to buy it.<br> Look, I have a gold watch<br> with a gold chain ...<br> made in your own country.<br> The watch and the chain,<br> they're worth at least 200 pesos.<br> I'll change it for your gun.<br> You better take it.<br> That's a good business for you.<br> You keep your watch,<br> I'll keep my gun.<br> Oh, you'll keep it? You will<br> keep it? We won't get it?<br> I'll show you.<br> Anybody get hurt?<br> Looks like we won that round.<br> - That guy with the gold hat, ain't he ?<br> - We spotted him too. The train robber.<br> - Maybe they got enough, huh?<br> - No, I doubt it.<br> Now that they know there's four guns,<br> they'll be more determined than ever.<br> - What do you suppose they'll pull next?<br> - No telling. All we can do is sit tight.<br> Oh, Cody, you all right?<br> He's dead.<br> Got it right through the neck.<br> One less gun.<br> Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.<br> - If they're up to what I think,<br> it ain't funny. - What's that?<br> Building barricades that move.<br> An old Indian trick.<br> They crawl and push the barricades.<br> You can't see where to shoot.<br> I'd be willing to trade my share<br> of the mine right now ...<br> for three or four hand grenades.<br> You'd better get to your posts.<br> Hey, they're beating it.<br> - What do you make of that?<br> - Your guess is as good as mine.<br> Wait a minute,<br> this may be a trick to lure us out.<br> I don't think so. They ain't good<br> enough actors for this kind of a trick.<br> Hey, partner. Up here.<br> Here's a sight if<br> there ever was one.<br> Federales. Look at them.<br> I could kiss every one of them.<br> Must have gotten it from the villagers<br> there were bandits this way.<br> Why don't the bandits<br> wait here, fight?<br> They know all the tricks, that's why.<br> With us and the Federales,<br> they wouldn't have a chance.<br> Oh, go get them, sic them time.<br> Chew them up and don't spit<br> them out. Swallow them.<br> Oh, am I happy. Tell you the truth,<br> I was already eating dirt.<br> - I wonder who he is.<br> - Huh? Oh.<br> And if he's got any folks.<br> Supposing he has?<br> Let's take a look at his belongings.<br> Hmm. A few hundred pesos.<br> Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.<br> There's a letter from Dallas too.<br> This must be his home.<br> Reckon she's his girl.<br> Not bad.<br> "Dear Jim, your letter just arrived.<br> It was such a relief to get word<br> after so many months of "<br> - "Silence."<br> - "Silence.<br> I realize, of course, that ...<br> there aren't any mailboxes ...<br> that you can drop a letter in ...<br> out there in the wild."<br> You better read it.<br> "But that doesn't keep me<br> from worrying about you.<br> Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses<br> his daddy almost as much as I do.<br> He keeps asking,<br> 'When's Daddy coming home?'<br> You say if you do not make<br> a real find this time ...<br> you'll never go again.<br> I cannot begin to tell you<br> how my heart rejoices ...<br> at those words, if you<br> really mean them.<br> Now I feel free to tell you ...<br> I've never thought<br> any material treasure ...<br> no matter how great, is worth the<br> pain of these long separations.<br> The country is especially<br> lovely this year.<br> It's been a perfect spring.<br> Warm rains and hardly any frost.<br> The fruit trees are all in bloom.<br> The upper orchard looks aflame ...<br> and the lower,<br> like after a snowstorm.<br> Everybody looks forward<br> to big crops.<br> I do hope you are back<br> for the harvest.<br> Of course, I'm hoping that you<br> will at last strike it rich.<br> It is high time for luck<br> to start smiling upon you.<br> But just in case she doesn't ...<br> remember we've already found<br> life's real treasure.<br> Forever yours, Helen."<br> Well, I guess we better<br> dig a hole for him.<br> Yeah, not so good.<br> Not so good as yesterday.<br> My opinion? It's gonna be<br> a lot less from now on.<br> - We've taken all the gold this mountain<br> has. - How much do you figure we got?<br> Not as much as we was aiming<br> to collect. Not 40,000.<br> I'm willing to lower my hindsights.<br> We got upwards of 35,000 apiece. I tell<br> you, we ought to be plenty thankful.<br> Let's call it quits,<br> pack up and leave.<br> The sooner the better<br> as far as I'm concerned.<br> I don't want to keep<br> that dame waiting.<br> Take a week to put the<br> mountain back in shape.<br> Do what to the mountain?<br> - Make her appear like before<br> we came. - I don't get it.<br> We wounded this mountain.<br> Our duty to close her wounds.<br> The least we can do to show our gratitude<br> for all the wealth she's given us.<br> If you don't want to help me,<br> I'll do it alone.<br> You talk like it was a real woman.<br> She's been a lot better to me<br> than any woman I ever knew.<br> Keep your shirt on, old-timer.<br> Sure, I'll help you.<br> I reckon that's about everything.<br> Each man's burros with his goods<br> had better be his own responsibility.<br> Come on.<br> Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.<br> Yeah, thanks, mountain.<br> Thanks.<br> I've been thinking about her.<br> Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.<br> You know what?<br> We ought to give them a fourth just as<br> if he'd been our partner from the start.<br> What? A fourth of all our goods?<br> - That's right.<br> - Are you crazy?<br> Hadn't been for Cody, we<br> wouldn't have walked away.<br> Ask Howard.<br> The buzzard would have<br> got fat on us all right.<br> Yeah, it might just as<br> well have been one of us.<br> But it wasn't.<br> It's our good luck and his bad.<br> Whatever you guys do,<br> I'm going to give a fourth.<br> I got more than I need, anyhow. Half<br> what I got is enough to last me out.<br> Fourth? Sure.<br> You two guys must have been<br> born in a revival meeting.<br> We got company.<br> Steady, boys.<br> Curtin.<br> Coffee.<br> Give him some tobacco.<br> Hey.<br> Gracias.<br> We give them our tobacco, they<br> give us theirs, I don't get it.<br> Why not everybody smoke his own?<br> Take some and thank them.<br> They're after something.<br> Takes them a while to<br> come to the point.<br> To say what you want right off the bat<br> isn't considered polite among Indians.<br> They got nothing but time, huh?<br> Oh.<br> His boy fell in the water,<br> they fished him out.<br> - He ain't dead, but he just<br> won't come to. - Oh. Tough.<br> I'll have a look at the boy.<br> I'll be back in a little while.<br> Before morning, probably.<br> Look after my goods<br> while I am gone, huh?<br> Tequila.<br> Artificial respiration did it<br> and a few Boy Scout tricks.<br> I think it was more<br> shock than drowning.<br> He hadn't swallowed much water.<br> Maybe he was stunned while diving.<br> What gets me is how these Indians<br> knew we were in the woods anyhow.<br> When you're near their<br> villages, they know.<br> Don't ask me how, they just know.<br> What's up?<br> He's insisting we return<br> to his village, be guests.<br> Tell him to forget it.<br> Tell him he don't owe us a thing.<br> If he doesn't pay off his debt<br> the saints will be angry.<br> - Ha-ha-ha.<br> - This is no laughing matter.<br> I'm afraid he's determined to take<br> us with him, even if it means force.<br> I'll handle this.<br> Wait a minute. You can't fight your<br> way out of this. Put your guns away.<br> Have every Indian in the mountain on our<br> trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.<br> Well, what'd he say then?<br> It don't make any difference<br> about you, but I have to come.<br> - It's like that? He just wants you.<br> - Looks like it.<br> Why don't you go with them?<br> We'll meet you in Durango.<br> We'll wait there.<br> - What about my goods?<br> - Take them with you.<br> If they found out, they might forget he<br> was their honored guest and bump him off.<br> What'll I do?<br> Dump them on the ground?<br> We'll take them with us if you want<br> us to and wait for you in Durango.<br> I reckon that's about<br> the only solution.<br> I bet you'll remember this the<br> next time you try to do a good deed.<br> Maybe after I've stayed,<br> they'll give me a horse to ride.<br> That case I may be a day behind you.<br> That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.<br> Yeah, all the luck in the world.<br> We'll be lonesome without you.<br> But my Sunday school teacher used to <br> Used to say, "You got to learn to swallow<br> disappointments in this sad life."<br> Hurry up and join us.<br> Look out for those Indian dames.<br> They tell me they're smart.<br> One of them squaws might marry you.<br> Well, maybe I'll do just that. Pick me<br> out a good-looking squaw and marry her.<br> They're easy to dress, feed and enter-<br> tain. They don't nag at you, either.<br> Well, so long, partners.<br> See you in Durango.<br> Hey.<br> Ain't it always his burros<br> that won't march in line ...<br> stray off the trail and smash their<br> packs against the trees and the rocks?<br> I wish they'd stray off far enough<br> to fall down about 2,000 foot of gorge.<br> What was in your head<br> when you offered?<br> As if he couldn't manage by himself.<br> He knew what he was doing<br> when he turned them over to us.<br> Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?<br> What's the use of railing against<br> the old man? It won't do any good.<br> Save your breath for that<br> next piece of trail.<br> I'm stopping here for the night.<br> If you want to go on it's okay with<br> me, but take his burros with you.<br> They ain't my responsibility.<br> It's early. We can make<br> five miles more before dark.<br> Nobody ordered you to stay here. You<br> can go 20 miles more for all I care.<br> Ordered me?<br> You?<br> Who's ordering who to do anything?<br> You talk like you're<br> boss of this outfit.<br> Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.<br> - All right, if you can't go any further.<br> - Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.<br> I can go four times as far<br> as you, but I don't want to.<br> I could if I want to,<br> but I don't want to, see, mug?<br> What's the use of hollering?<br> We're started, we've got<br> to finish, like it or not.<br> We'll camp here.<br> Wonder what the old man's doing now.<br> Eating a meal of roast turkey and<br> drinking a bottle of tequila probably.<br> This is the first day we've<br> had to handle everything.<br> Once we get the hang of<br> it, it'll be easier.<br> How far away do you<br> suppose the railroad is?<br> - Not so far as the crow flies.<br> - We ain't crows.<br> I figure we can reach the<br> high pass in two days more ...<br> after that it'll be three to the railroad.<br> Figuring no hard luck on the trail.<br> What's the joke, Dobbsie?<br> Aren't you going to let me in on it?<br> In on it? Sure, I will.<br> Sure.<br> Well, go ahead and spill it.<br> What's so funny?<br> I was thinking what a bonehead<br> play that old jackass made ...<br> when he put all his goods<br> in our keeping.<br> What do you mean?<br> Figured he'd let us do his<br> sweating for him, did he?<br> - We'll show him.<br> - What are you getting at?<br> Oh, man, can't you see?<br> It's all ours.<br> We don't go back to Durango<br> at all, sawy? Not at all.<br> I don't follow you, Dobbsie.<br> Don't be such a sap.<br> Where did you ever grow up?<br> All right, to make it clear<br> to a dumbhead like you ...<br> we take all his goods and go straight<br> up north and leave the jackass flat.<br> You aren't serious? You don't<br> really mean what you're saying.<br> Fred C. Dobbs don't say<br> nothing he don't mean.<br> As long as I can do anything about it,<br> you won't touch the old man's goods.<br> I know exactly what you mean.<br> You want to take it all for<br> yourself and cut me out.<br> No, I'm on the level with the old man,<br> just as I'd be with you if you weren't here.<br> Get off your soapbox. You only sound<br> foolish out here in this wilderness.<br> I know you for what you are.<br> For a long time I've had my suspicions<br> about you and now I know I've been right.<br> - What suspicions? - You're not<br> putting anything over on me.<br> I see right through you.<br> For a long time you've had it in mind<br> to bump me off the first opportunity ...<br> and bury me out here in the bush.<br> So you could take not only the old<br> man's goods but mine in the bargain.<br> When you get to Durango safely<br> you'll have a big laugh ...<br> thinking how dumb<br> the old man and I were.<br> Make another move towards me<br> and I'll pull the trigger.<br> Now, get your hands up.<br> Come on, get them up!<br> Was I right, or was I?<br> You and your Sunday-school talk<br> about protecting people's goods.<br> You. Go on, stand up,<br> and take it like a man.<br> Come on, get up!<br> Let go of it.<br> - The cards are dealt<br> the other way now. - Yeah.<br> - Now listen to me.<br> - I'll listen <br> Dobbs, look, you're all wrong.<br> Not for a moment did I ever intend<br> to rob you or do you any harm.<br> It's just like I said:<br> I'd fight for you just as<br> I'd fight for the old man's.<br> If you really mean that,<br> give me back my gun.<br> My pal.<br> Wouldn't it be better, the way things are,<br> to separate tomorrow or even tonight?<br> - That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?<br> - Why me more than you?<br> So you could fall on me from<br> behind, sneak up and shoot me.<br> All right, I'll go first.<br> And wait for me on the<br> trail to ambush me?<br> Why wouldn't I do it<br> now if I meant to?<br> I'll tell you why,<br> because you're yellow.<br> You haven't got nerve enough<br> while I'm looking you in the eye.<br> Think like that, nothing<br> to do but to tie you up.<br> I'll tell you what. I'll make you<br> a little bet. Three times 35 is 105.<br> I'll bet you $105,000<br> you go to sleep before I do.<br> Get up there at the<br> head of the train.<br> Get up.<br> The cards are dealt the other way now,<br> and for the last time. No more shuffling.<br> - What cards?<br> - I'm gonna finish this right now.<br> No more taking orders<br> like I had to do today.<br> - You're gonna murder me? - No,<br> brother, not murder. No, your mistake.<br> I'm doing this to save my life<br> that you'd be taking from me.<br> - The old man'll catch up with you.<br> - He will, will he?<br> I got an answer for that.<br> Know what I'm gonna tell him?<br> I'm gonna tell him you tied me to a tree<br> and made your getaway taking all the goods.<br> He'll be looking for you and not me.<br> Up. March. Today I had to march to<br> your music, now you'll march to mine.<br> - Where?<br> - To your funeral.<br> Come on, keep going.<br> Get up. Sleepy, huh?<br> You'll be asleep soon enough.<br> Sound asleep.<br> Maybe I didn't kill him.<br> Maybe he just staggered and<br> fell down without being hit.<br> You keep it, it's yours anyhow.<br> No, they won't find him.<br> I'll dig a hole for him<br> first thing in the morning.<br> This fire ...<br> don't give much heat.<br> Conscience.<br> What a thing.<br> If you believe you've got a con-<br> science, it'll pester you to death.<br> But if you don't believe<br> you've got one ...<br> what can it do to you?<br> Makes me sick all this talking<br> and fussing about nonsense.<br> Maybe I'd better<br> leave him like he is.<br> Ain't very likely<br> anybody will find him.<br> In a weeks' time, the buzzards and the<br> ants will have done away with him anyway.<br> I don't know what's getting into me.<br> Was that really a tiger?<br> No.<br> What if his eyes are<br> open, looking at me?<br> Best thing to do is to get<br> to the railroad in a hurry.<br> Burro.<br> It's better not to have buried him.<br> I did right, yeah.<br> What I should have done, maybe,<br> was bury his clothes ...<br> and leave him to the ants<br> and the buzzards.<br> Buzzards.<br> If somebody saw them circling,<br> they'd know something was dead.<br> Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.<br> Lucky for me.<br> Curtin.<br> Where are you? Curtin.<br> I better get a hold of myself.<br> I mustn't lose my head.<br> There's one thing certain,<br> he ain't here.<br> I got it. The tiger.<br> Yeah. Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have<br> dragged him off to his lair, that's what.<br> Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones<br> will be left to tell the story.<br> Done as if by order.<br> Muchas gracias.<br> Bueno, bueno.<br> I came to in the middle of the night.<br> My gun was on the ground beside me.<br> He must have left it there<br> to make it look like suicide.<br> I figured he'd come back in the morning<br> to see if I still had a flicker of life.<br> I thought about waiting for him<br> and letting him have it ...<br> but there was a good chance<br> in my condition I might miss.<br> So I decided to crawl away<br> like a poisoned dog.<br> - Easy, you're talking too much.<br> - Don't you worry about me.<br> I'll pull out of this if<br> only to get that guy.<br> It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off<br> with our goods and is on his way north.<br> - Yeah. - I reckon we<br> can't blame him too much.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean, he's not a real<br> killer, as killers go.<br> I think he's as honest as<br> the next fella, or almost.<br> The mistake was leaving you two<br> in the depths of the wilderness ...<br> with 100,000 between you.<br> Mighty big temptation,<br> partner, believe me.<br> He shot me down in cold blood.<br> After I was down he shot me<br> a second time just to make sure.<br> If I'd have been young and been out<br> there, I might have been tempted.<br> Maybe I wouldn't have fallen,<br> but I would've been tempted.<br> There now.<br> You're almost as good as new.<br> Now, to find that thief<br> and get our goods back.<br> They're not only giving me a horse<br> but they're going along to protect me.<br> - You ain't going.<br> - Who says so?<br> A lot of hard riding.<br> You wouldn't be up to it.<br> - You aren't leaving me behind, see?<br> - Look at you.<br> You're weak as a kitten. Don't worry,<br> I'll look after our interests.<br> I'm going.<br> Well, I reckon you're going.<br> Adios, senora. Gracias.<br> Burro.<br> Burro.<br> Have you got any cigarettes?<br> No, I haven't.<br> I've got a little tobacco ...<br> if that'll do.<br> Bueno.<br> No paper to roll it in?<br> Papers?<br> Yeah.<br> Here you are.<br> - Going to Durango?<br> - Yeah.<br> That's where I'm headed.<br> I've got to sell my burros.<br> I gotta get some money.<br> I haven't got a red cent.<br> Matches?<br> Money? We need money too.<br> Yeah? I could use<br> a good mule driver ...<br> maybe two or three.<br> How much is the pay?<br> Two pesos.<br> Of course, I can't<br> pay you in advance.<br> I gotta wait till I get<br> to town, get the money.<br> Hey. Did I know you from someplace?<br> Maybe I know you.<br> No, I don't think so.<br> - Are you alone?<br> - Oh, no.<br> No, I'm not alone.<br> I got a couple of friends<br> coming on horseback.<br> Yeah, they ought to<br> be here any minute.<br> Hey.<br> That's funny.<br> A man all by himself in bandit<br> country with a string of burros ...<br> and his friends behind him<br> on horseback.<br> Your friends must be<br> very far behind you.<br> Pablo cannot see any dust<br> even from their horses.<br> They'll be along any<br> minute, I tell you.<br> I know who you are.<br> You're the guy in the hole.<br> The one who wouldn't<br> give us the rifle.<br> I never laid eyes on you until now.<br> What you got in the bags?<br> - Seems to me like hides.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah. That's what they are, hides.<br> Ought to bring in quite<br> a lot of money, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> Sure you don't want to come along<br> with me and help me with the burros?<br> Burro.<br> Get away from my burro.<br> We can sell those burros for<br> just as good a price as you'd get.<br> Get away from my burro.<br> You can't frighten even<br> a sick louse with that.<br> You can only shoot one of us ...<br> and he wouldn't mind too much.<br> The Federales are after him anyway.<br> So what, with your gun?<br> - We'll take that chance.<br> - Get back there.<br> Burros.<br> Burros. Burros. Burros.<br> Burros ...burros.<br> Burros.<br> - Shooting.<br> - Volley. Execution, probably.<br> - Dobbs is dead.<br> - What?<br> - Bandits got him.<br> - Our goods. What about our goods?<br> - What? What? - He says our<br> goods are safe in his office.<br> - It's not here, Howard, it's not here.<br> - Keep your shirt on, keep your shirt on.<br> What? What?<br> He heard the bandits talking<br> while they were waiting to be shot.<br> They thought it was bags of sand<br> hidden among the hide ...<br> to make it weigh more to sell them.<br> - Where are they?<br> In the ruins outside town. Come on.<br> Looks like a norther.<br> Oh, laugh, Curtin, old boy,<br> it's a great joke played on us ...<br> by the Lord, or fate, or nature,<br> whatever you prefer ...<br> but whoever or whatever played it<br> certainly had a sense of humor.<br> The gold has gone back<br> to where we found it.<br> This is worth 10 months of<br> suffering and labor, this joke is.<br> Well, Howard, what next? I wonder.<br> I'm all fixed as far as I'm<br> concerned as a medicine man.<br> I'll have three meals a day,<br> five if I want ...<br> roof over my head, and a drink<br> now and then to warm me up.<br> I will be worshiped, fed,<br> and treated like a priest ...<br> for telling people things they wanna hear.<br> Good medicine men are born, not made.<br> Come and see me sometime.<br> Even you'll take off your hat<br> when you see how respected I am.<br> The day before yesterday they<br> wanted to make me their legislature.<br> Their whole legislature.<br> I don't know what that means. Must be<br> the highest honor they can bestow.<br> Yeah, I'm all fixed for the<br> rest of my natural life.<br> - How about yourself? What do you<br> aim to do? - I haven't got any idea.<br> You're young yet. You've got plenty of time<br> to make three or four fortunes for yourself.<br> You know, the worst ain't so<br> bad when it finally happens.<br> Not half as bad as you figure<br> it'll be before it's happened.<br> I'm no worse off<br> than I was in Tampico.<br> All I'm out is a couple hundred bucks<br> when you come right down to it.<br> - Not much compared to what Dobbsie lost.<br> - Any special place you're bent on going?<br> No, all places are the same to me.<br> You can keep my share of what the<br> burros and the hides will bring ...<br> if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.<br> See Cody's widow. Better than writing.<br> And besides, it's July<br> and the fruit harvest.<br> How about it?<br> It's a deal.<br> Well, let's get going.<br> - Well, goodbye, Curtin.<br> - Goodbye, Howard.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Same to you.<br>
