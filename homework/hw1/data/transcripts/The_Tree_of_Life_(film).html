                        Brother...<br> Mother...<br> It was they who led me to your door.<br> A man's heart has heard two ways through life.<br> The way of nature.<br> And the way of grace.<br> You have to choose which one you'll follow.<br> Grace doesn't try to please itself.<br> It accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked...<br> It accepts insults and injuries.<br> Nature only wants to please itself.<br> Bless our lord this food...<br> Get others to please it too.<br> ...Loving and faithful service...<br> It likes to lord it over them.<br> ...Bless these boys...<br> To have its own way.<br> It finds reasons to be unhappy.<br> When all the world is shining around it.<br> And love is smiling through all things.<br> They taught us, that no one<br> who loves the way of grace,<br> ever comes to a bad end.<br> I will be true to you.<br> Whatever comes...<br> My son.<br> I just want to die. To be with him.<br> He's in God's hands now.<br> He was in God's hands the whole time.<br> Wasn't he?<br> My home.<br> My God.<br> I shall fear no evil.<br> Fear no evil, for you are with me.<br> What did you gain?<br> Be not far from me, for trouble is near.<br> Go on now, we're alright.<br> We're alright.<br> Thank you.<br> Shouldn't have your memories of him, ...<br> You have to be strong now, and...<br> I know, the pain will, it will pass in time.<br> You know, it might seem,<br> hard, my saying that, but it's true.<br> I don't want it to.<br> Life goes on.<br> People pass along.<br> Nothing stays the same.<br> You still got the other two.<br> The Lord gives and the Lord takes away.<br> That's the way he is.<br> He sends flies to wounds...that he should heal.<br> I never got a chance to tell him how sorry I was.<br> I even...<br> ...punched himself in the face for no reason.<br> You sit next to me at the piano<br> and I criticized where he'd turned the pages.<br> I might even feel ashamed.<br> Why shame?<br> Poor boy. Poor boy.<br> How did you come to me?<br> In what shape?<br> What disguise?<br> I see the child I was.<br> I see my brother.<br> True.<br> Kind.<br> He died when he was 19.<br> Just check, this one against this.<br> She wants to get back together.<br> But, the chapter's closed, the story's been told.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> Experiment.<br> When you're young, it's all about your career.<br> I just feel like I'm...bumping into walls...<br> The world's gone to the dogs,<br> people are greedy and keep getting worse.<br> I try to get into their hands.<br> Hey dad, I'm sorry I said what I said, I'm...<br> Yea, I think about him every day.<br> I just shouldn't have said what I did, I'm sorry.<br> What are you thinking?<br> I know, I know what you did...<br> And only two of those were turned down by client...<br> How did I lose you?<br> Wandered.<br> Forgot you.<br> Find me.<br> How did she bear it?<br> Mother.<br> Was I false to you?<br> Lord...<br> Why?<br> Where were you?<br> Did you know?<br> Who are we to you?<br> Answer me.<br> We cry to you.<br> My soul.<br> My son.<br> Hear us.<br> Light up my life.<br> I search for you.<br> My home.<br> My child.<br> You spoke to me through her.<br> You spoke with me from the sky.<br> The trees.<br> Before I knew I loved you ...<br> Believed in you.<br> When did you first touch my heart?<br> ...And manfully to fight under His banner<br> against sin, the world, and the devil...<br> We're having Mr. McMander over for dinner.<br> This is a double bidder right on in.<br> What's this?<br> Two alligators.<br> Two alligators.<br> Kangaroo.<br> Kangaroo.<br> Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump.<br> Sweetheart.<br> Please.<br> I know.<br> No!

Look it here. Look here.<br> Okay, now come back here son. Come on back.<br> Let's stay out of there.<br> "Now, my dears" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning,<br> "You may go into the fields or down the lane"<br> "Don't go into Mr. Mcgregor's garden"<br> "Your father had an accident there"<br> That's where God lives.<br> Goodnight, we'll see you in 5 years.<br> Want to eat a grasshopper?<br> I found it! I found this old bone!<br> Bless this food to our use.<br> As to your loving and faithful service.<br> Make us remindful of those who are in need.<br> Amen.<br> Can you pass the butter, please?<br> Can you pass the butter please sir.<br> Sir.<br> What did you do today?<br> We went to school.<br> After that.<br> What about the yard?<br> Did you put the runners in like I asked?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, it didn't look like it.<br> Yes.<br> Mr. Reese liked Jack's book report.<br> Nobody's asked sweetheart.<br> You know this.<br> Son.<br> Sir.<br> Reach me my lighter.<br> Haven't you forgotten something?<br> Do you love your father?<br> Yes, sir.<br> ...and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.<br> They found him stretched out<br> on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun.<br> Admiring his beautiful new coat.<br> Who do you love most?<br> I love you all three the same.<br> Tell us a story from before we can remember.<br> He went for a ride in a plane once.<br> It was a graduation present.<br> Mother...<br> Am I any good?<br> Brave.<br> Can it happen to anyone?<br> Nobody talks about it.<br> Help me not to sass my dad.<br> Help me not to get dogs in fights.<br> Help me be thankful for everything I've got.<br> Where do you live?<br> Help me not to tell lies.<br> Are you watching me?<br> I want to know what you are.<br> I want to see what you see.<br> Come here.<br> You're going to stand there and<br> you're going to close this door quietly, 50 times.<br> Count it out.<br> You can't just take off the top.<br> You got to get them by the roots.<br> Your mother's naive.<br> It takes fierce will to get ahead in this world.<br> If you're good, people take advantage of you.<br> Every one of these top executives,<br> you know how they got where they are?<br> Floated right down the middle of the river.<br> Don't let anyone tell you<br> there's anything you can't do.<br> Don't do like I did, promise me that.<br> Dreamed of being a great musician.<br> I let myself get sidetracked.<br> If you're looking for something to happen,<br> that was it. Life, lived it.<br> Job imagined he might build his nest on high.<br> That the integrity of his behavior<br> would protect him against misfortune.<br> And his friends thought mistakenly<br> That the Lord could only have punished him<br> because secretly he had done something wrong.<br> But no.<br> Misfortune befalls the good as well.<br> We can't protect ourselves against it.<br> We can't protect our children.<br> We can't say to ourselves,<br> even if I'm not happy,<br> I'm going to make sure they are.<br> We run before the wind, we<br> think that it will carry us forever.<br> It will not.<br> We vanish as a cloud,<br> we whither as the autumn grass.<br> And like a tree, are rooted up.<br> Is there some fraud in the scheme of the universe?<br> Is there nothing which is deathless?<br> Nothing, which does not pass away?<br> We cannot stay where we are.<br> We must journey forth.<br> We must find that which is<br> greater than fortune or fate.<br> Nothing can bring us peace, but that.<br> Is the body of the wise man or<br> the just, exempt from any pain?<br> From any disquietude, from the deformity<br> that might blight its beauty<br> from the weakness, that might destroy its health.<br> Do you trust in God? Job too,<br> was close to the Lord.<br> Are your friends and children, your security?<br> There is no hiding place in all<br> the world where trouble may not find you.<br> No one knows when sorrow might<br> visit his house, any more than Job did.<br> At the very moment<br> everything was taken away from Job.<br> He knew it was the<br> Lord who had taken it away<br> Return from the passing shows of time<br> He saught that which is eternal.<br> As he alone see God's hand, who sees that he gives.<br> Or does not also the one see<br> God's hand, who sees that he takes away.<br> Or does he alone see God,<br> who sees God turn his face towards him?<br> Does not also he see God,<br> who sees God turn his back.<br> He's a friend of mine.<br> The one who's after real estate in town.<br> Frank Johnson.<br> Started out as a barber.<br> He built something, big.<br> Now you'd think he was the<br> fourth person of the Holy Trinity.<br> They never talk about their money.<br> Wrong people go hungry.<br> Die.<br> Wrong people get loved.<br> The world lives by a trigger.<br> You want to succeed? You can't be too good.<br> Hey there young fella, try my cornbread.<br> Do y'all want some butter, do you?<br> How about a pound of bread.<br> You'll like this right? Okay?
