                        Heir of salvation,<br> purchase of God<br> born of his spirit<br> and washed in his blood<br> this is my story,<br> da da da, this is my song<br> praising my savior,<br> all the day long<br> this is my story<br> [ Horn honks ]<br> [ Children shouting ]<br> [ Laughter ]<br> [ Sizzling ]<br> Lord up in heaven,<br> thank you for the gift of...<br> Thank you for this meal<br> that you are offering us today<br> in hopes<br> that it will nourish our body.<br> We praise thy name,<br> oh, lord.<br> Thank you.<br> Amen.<br> [ Humming ]<br> [ Train whistle blows ]<br> [ Sighs ]<br> [ Humming continues ]<br> [ Humming continues ]<br> [ Humming continues ]<br> Don't be afraid of making noise,<br> honey.<br> I'm awake.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Couldn't sleep?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Why couldn't you sleep?<br> Ah...<br> Just couldn't.<br> Couldn't you sleep?<br> No.<br> Haven't been to bed<br> at all.<br> You're not worried<br> about your job, are you, son?<br> No. Everybody seems<br> to like me there.<br> Thinking about asking<br> for a raise.<br> You should, son,<br> as hard as you work.<br> Why couldn't you sleep,<br> mama?<br> Full moon.<br> Never could sleep<br> when there's a full moon.<br> Even back in bountiful<br> when I'd be out in the field<br> working so hard I'd think<br> my legs would give out on me.<br> Just let there be a full moon,<br> and I'd toss and I'd turn.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Once, when you were little<br> and the moon was full,<br> I woke you up, dressed you,<br> and took you out for a walk.<br> You remember that?<br> No, ma'am.<br> You don't?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Well, I do.<br> I remember<br> like it was yesterday.<br> I dressed you<br> and I took you outside.<br> There was an old dog<br> howling away off somewhere,<br> and you got scared<br> and started to cry.<br> I said,<br> "son, why are you crying?"<br> And you said someone once<br> told you that when a dog howls,<br> a person<br> is dying somewhere.<br> I held you close to me because<br> you was just shaking with fear.<br> And then you asked me<br> to explain to you about dying.<br> And I said,<br> "son, you are far too young<br> "to be even thinking<br> about things like that<br> for a long time<br> to come."<br> It's funny the things you<br> think of when you can't sleep.<br> I was trying to think<br> about that song<br> I used to like<br> to hear you sing.<br> What song was that, son?<br> Ah, I don't remember the name.<br> I just remember I'd always laugh<br> when you'd sing it.<br> [ Laughs ] That one.<br> What was the name<br> of it?<br> I don't know.<br> You know I hate not to be able<br> to remember something.<br> Hush...<br> Little baby,<br> don't say a word<br> [ Laughs ]<br> Mama's gonna buy you<br> a mockingbird<br> and if that mockingbird<br> don't sing<br> mama's gonna buy you<br> a diamond ring<br> [ Both chuckle ]<br> I used to think I would buy you<br> the world back in those days.<br> I remember remarking that<br> to my papa.<br> Hmm.<br> Ludie?<br> Hmm?<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> Would you like me<br> to fix you some hot milk?<br> [ Laughs ] Yes, ma'am.<br> If you don't mind.<br> I don't mind at all,<br> son.<br> I don't mind<br> at all.<br> Hush, little baby,<br> don't say a word.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Mama's gonna buy you<br> a mockingbird<br> and if that mockingbird<br> don't sing<br> mama's gonna buy you<br> a diamond ring<br> Why don't you<br> turn on the lights?<br> What's the sense<br> of sitting around in the dark?<br> [ Sighs ]<br> [ Soft music plays ]<br> How you expect<br> to go to work in the morning<br> if you don't get your sleep,<br> ludie?<br> I was hoping the hot milk<br> would make me sleepy.<br> What's the matter<br> with you<br> that you can't sleep,<br> mother watts?<br> Full moon, jessie mae.<br> Full moon.<br> [ Sighs ] What's that<br> got to do with it?<br> I don't know<br> what's the matter with y'all.<br> I never had any trouble sleeping<br> in my life.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> I guess<br> I have a clear conscience.<br> Mother watts,<br> where's that recipe<br> rosella gave me<br> on the phone today?<br> Jessie mae, I don't remember<br> you ever giving me any recipe.<br> Well, I did.<br> Well, I certainly have<br> no recollection of it.<br> You don't?<br> I gave it to this morning<br> in this very room.<br> And I said, "please put it away<br> in my dresser."<br> And you said,<br> "I will."<br> And you went out holding it<br> in your hand.<br> Did you look<br> on your dresser?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> And it wasn't there?<br> No, ma'am.<br> I looked just before<br> I went to bed.<br> Well,<br> let me take a look around.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> I swear.<br> Just gets<br> on my nerves.<br> Now, I know<br> we couldn't afford it before<br> so I kept quiet about it,<br> but now you're working again.<br> And I don't think a picture show<br> once or twice a week<br> will break us.<br> Why don't we go out<br> one night this week?<br> Well, I mean,<br> I think we have to.<br> I was talking to rosella about<br> it on the phone this morning.<br> When did you and rosella<br> become friendly again?<br> Oh,<br> this morning.<br> She just all of a sudden<br> call me up on the telephone.<br> She said<br> she'd quit being mad if I would.<br> I said, "shucks,<br> I wasn't the one<br> that was mad<br> in the first place."<br> She was the one<br> that was mad.<br> I said, "I was plain spoken.<br> Said exactly what I felt.<br> You'll have to take me as I am<br> or leave me alone."<br> [ Drawer slams ]<br> Rosella found out she definitely<br> can't have any children.<br> [ Scoffs ]<br> Walk, don't run!<br> You know, your mother's<br> pension check didn't come today.<br> It's the 18th.<br> I swear it was due.<br> I can't understand<br> the government -- always late.<br> Did you find it?<br> Not yet.<br> Well, then,<br> forget about it.<br> Look for it<br> in the morning.<br> I'm gonna look for it<br> till I find it.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> Honestly, ludie.<br> She is<br> so stubborn!<br> Announcer:<br> Keep your dial set at kdht.<br> Rosella says she's glad<br> to hear you're working again.<br> She said she was<br> cleaning out some drawers<br> the night before last<br> and come across a picture<br> she had taken of you and me when<br> we first started going together.<br> I said, "I don't care<br> to see them. No, thank you."<br> The passing of time<br> makes me sad.<br> Here's your recipe,<br> jessie mae.<br> Well, thank you,<br> but I told you not to bother.<br> Where'd you find it?<br> In your dresser drawer,<br> right-hand side.<br> In my dresser drawer?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I looked on top of the dresser<br> and it wasn't there.<br> And so my head<br> told me to look --<br> mama watts?<br> Yes, ma'am?<br> Ludie, how many times<br> have I asked her<br> never to go<br> in my dresser drawer?<br> But I thought you wanted me<br> to find your recipe.<br> But I don't want you looking<br> in my dresser drawers!<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> [ Scoffs ]<br> And just never<br> let me catch you<br> looking in them again<br> for anything!<br> I can't stand people<br> snooping in my dresser drawers!<br> All right,<br> then.<br> Next time,<br> find it yourself.<br> Pick that recipe up,<br> if you please.<br> Pick it up yourself.<br> I have no intention<br> of picking it up.<br> You pick that up!<br> I won't.<br> You will!<br> Jessie mae, for God's sake.<br> You're both<br> acting like children.<br> It's 1:30<br> in the morning.<br> You tell her<br> to pick that up.<br> I won't.<br> You will! This is my house,<br> and you'll do as you're told!<br> No, I won't.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> Now, I hope<br> you're satisfied.<br> You got ludie<br> good and upset.<br> He won't sleep<br> for the rest of the night.<br> What you want to do,<br> get him sick again?<br> [ Pounding on wall ]<br> Man: Quiet down over there!<br> Oh, shut up!<br> You are gonna go too far with me<br> one of these days, old lady.<br> [ Scoffs ]<br> I can't stand this, ludie.<br> I'm at the end<br> of my rope.<br> I will not take being insulted<br> by your mother or anyone else!<br> Mama, will you give this recipe<br> to jessie mae?<br> All right,<br> ludie.<br> Mama, will you please tell<br> jessie mae that you're sorry?<br> Ludie.<br> Please, mama.<br> All right,<br> son.<br> Jessie mae?<br> What do you want, ludie?<br> Mama has something<br> to say to you.<br> What is it?<br> I'm sorry, jessie mae,<br> I threw the recipe on the floor.<br> I accept<br> your apology.<br> Announcer: Looking for<br> the best music ever?<br> You dial is set...<br> [ Sighs ]<br> ...at A.M. 79, Houston's kdht.<br> [ Soft music plays ]<br> Jessie mae,<br> I know it's hard and all,<br> but for your own sake --<br> I just think sometimes I-if you<br> try to ignore certain things --<br> ignore?

the things<br> he couldn't stand<br> was to see a bird<br> shot on his land.<br> If the men<br> came hunting,<br> he would take a gun<br> and chase them away.<br> I think the birds knew<br> they couldn't be touched here.<br> Our land was always a home<br> to them.<br> Ducks and geese and finches<br> and bluejays and blue birds<br> and red birds and wild canaries<br> and black birds and

very nice-looking man.<br> Do you remember my papa<br> at all, son?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Not too well.<br> I was only 10<br> when he died, mama.<br> I remember<br> the day he died.<br> I heard about it as<br> I was coming home from school.<br> Lee Williams told me.<br> I thought he was joking.<br> I called him a liar.<br> I remember...<br> You taking me<br> into the parlor there<br> on the day of

his best friend<br> and that his life was<br> a real example for me to follow.<br> I remember grandmama<br> sitting by the coffin crying.<br> She made me promise<br> that when I had a son of my

to get along.<br> Own their own home<br> and have a car.<br> Does your heart good<br> to hear them tell about<br> how they all get along.<br> Everybody has their own job,<br> even the youngest
