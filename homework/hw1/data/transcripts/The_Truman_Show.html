I did it!<br> I'm on the truman show!<br> Mike: but there's never<br> Been anything to compare<br> With this most recent<br> Breach in security--<br> The first intruder to be<br> A former cast member.<br> A dead one at that.<br> Gotta say, writing kirk<br> Back in--masterstroke.<br> Since kirk started this<br> Crisis in truman's life,<br> I came to the conclusion<br> That only he could end it.<br> Truman! Truman! No!<br> [construction noises]<br> That's off limits!<br> Why? What's<br> Over there?<br> Nothing. It's dangerous.<br> That's all.<br> You've got to know<br> Your limitations, truman.<br> Mike: but let's remind<br> Viewers exactly why<br> Dad was written out<br> In the first place.<br> Christof: as truman grew up,<br> We were forced<br> To manufacture ways<br> To keep him on the island.<br> I'd like to be<br> An explorer,<br> Like the great<br> Magellan.<br> You're too late.<br> There's really<br> Nothing left to explore.<br> [snarling]<br> Christof: finally, i came up<br> With kirk's drowning.<br> Mike: most effective.<br> Truman's been terrified<br> Of the water ever since.<br> Christof: when kirk read<br> The synopsis of the episode,<br> He was disappointed<br> To say the least.<br> Jesus!<br> I'm sure that's what caused<br> Him to break onto the set.<br> But how do you intend to<br> Explain his 22-year absence?<br> Amnesia.<br> Brilliant.

Everything<br> On the show is for sale.<br> From the actor's wardrobe,<br> Food products,<br> To the very homes<br> They live in.<br> Mike: and all of it available<br> In the truman catalog.<br> Operators are standing by.<br> Christof, let me ask you,<br> Why do you think truman<br> Has never come close<br> To discovering the true nature<br> Of his world until now?<br> We accept the reality<br> Of the world<br> With which we are<br> Presented.<br> It's as simple as that.<br> The hague for christof.<br> Hello?
