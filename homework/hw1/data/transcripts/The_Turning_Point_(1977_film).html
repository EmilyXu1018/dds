                        This is KKNG Stereo 92, KKNG,<br> Oklahoma City.<br> The magnificent American Ballet Company<br> is at the Civic Center Music Hall.<br> Great dancing stars are performing<br> full-length Tchaikovsky ballets,<br> plus many classic and contemporary<br> favorites from ABC's vast repertoire.<br> Tickets are available<br> at the Music Hall box office and all agencies.<br> KKNG. And now we continue<br> with music from the ballet.<br> Is everybody ready?<br> Gorgeous.<br> Very smart!<br> - I thought you were gonna set up the bar.<br> - There'll be time after we get back.<br> Dad.<br> The wife's always the last to know.<br> Emilia, will you get dressed?<br> Janina, that's enough.<br> There'll be time when we get back.<br> And it takes you an hour to get ready.<br> Will you go and do it? Where's Ethan?<br> Mom, those beads look<br> absolutely gross with that dress.<br> These beads were given to me by Emma<br> before you were born.<br> Well, they look gross now.<br> - Ethan? Ethan, will you quit that?<br> - It's the lights. I'm crazy.<br> Well, the lights are for the party.<br> Come on, we're leaving in two minutes.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> - Who's got the tickets?<br> - I don't have them.<br> - I got 'em.<br> - You have the tickets.<br> I am so nervous.<br> Momma, don't be so nervous.<br> - How are you doin'?<br> - OK.<br> - Did you have a good cry?<br> - A beaut.<br> - What'd you tell the kids?<br> - Nothing. They know you.<br> They've heard the tale of you and Emma<br> rehearsing for the same part a hundred times.<br> - There's no law says we gotta go backstage.<br> - Yes, there is.<br> Come to the party. Relax, Sevilla.<br> What's the point of doing a perfect arabesque<br> for audiences who don't know the difference?<br> I was terrible tonight.<br> I'm going home to soak in a hot bath.<br> You are no fun, Sevilla. I'll put you in a taxi.<br> No, thanks, love. My limo's waiting.<br> - Where are the showers?<br> - Over that way, I think.<br> Deedee?<br> - Freddie.<br> - Baby, how are you?<br> Freddie. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.<br> Meet our kids.<br> This is Emilia, Janina and Ethan.<br> You lookjust great.<br> Deedee.<br> ...instead of four.<br> - Yes. And he loops that part, so...<br> Hello, Adelaide.<br> Well.<br> You've held up very well, dearie.<br> - So've you.<br> - Running this company keeps me trim.<br> You could lose a few pounds, Deedee.<br> So you always said.<br> - No cakes or candy tonight at the party.<br> - Not a cookie, cookie.<br> Deedee?<br> It's Michael.<br> Michael Cooke.<br> It's Michael.<br> Wayne? Wayne, Michael's here.<br> Michael...<br> - Hi, Wayne.<br> - Look at you.<br> - Damn, you look impressive, sir.<br> - So impressive Deedee didn't recognize me.<br> You weren't the world's greatest<br> choreographer when we left.<br> - Wasn't I? I thought I was.<br> - He'd done Anna Karenina.<br> Hey, come on.<br> - From bar four on?<br> - Yes. But then I think it's gotta build.<br> - Towards the end.<br> - Tonight it was slow.<br> We should speed it up.<br> That's how it should go. It shouldn't be any<br> slower than that. I feel like I'm on point for...<br> Here you are. Oh, God.<br> - You were wonderful.<br> - Oh, I wasn't wonderful.<br> - I wanted to be, but I wasn't.<br> - Yes, you were.<br> - I loved your flowers. Thanks so much.<br> - You were fabulous.<br> No, I wasn't.<br> You know my foot was acting up. I wrote you.<br> You couldn't notice it. I couldn't tell at all.<br> - I was so nervous because you were here.<br> - You were wonderful.<br> - I wasn't.<br> - Yes, you were.<br> You really were, Emma.<br> Oh, Wayne.<br> Oh, Wayne.<br> You moved me like you always did.<br> Thanks.<br> - Oh, Wayne, it's been too long.<br> - Yeah, it sure has.<br> Well... how would you like to see<br> your godchild? Emilia, come over here.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Isn't she somethin'?<br> - Oh, my God.<br> Last time I saw you, I could pick you up.<br> Oh, she's lovely.<br> She's lovely, Deedee.<br> She is.<br> Janina.<br> - Janina, yes.<br> - Hi.<br> - And...<br> - Ethan.<br> Ethan. Hi.<br> OK.<br> He's a little dangerous.<br> Look at you.<br> They don't know how fast time goes, do they?<br> No. They don't.<br> Oh, Deedee.<br> Oh, Deedee...<br> Still disgustingly neat.<br> I was always such a total slob, wasn't I?<br> I only minded when you borrowed<br> my eyeliner and didn't return it.<br> To its proper place.<br> Oh, Emma. You don't travel<br> with this picture everywhere you go?<br> That and Mother. The rest appear<br> and disappear into a scrapbook.<br> - Oh, sweetheart.<br> - Did you really wear this hat to my wedding?<br> I love that hat.<br> God, can you believe how young we looked?<br> - I look like shit.<br> - Well, we all did next to Wayne.<br> - God, he's beautiful.<br> - Even in those pleated pants.<br> No wonder the whole company wanted him.<br> It's a good thing you had your eye elsewhere.<br> - You mean on Michael.<br> - No, I mean on the ball.<br> Tell me something, Emma.<br> What's it like to be you now?<br> I dance.<br> I take class, I rehearse, I perform.<br> I go home to my hotel.<br> Some cities are better than others.<br> So are some nights.<br> I thought I was good tonight.<br> I wanted to be, for you.<br> You couldn't help being good.<br> - Still?<br> - Yes.<br> You're an artist.<br> - Now what are you doing?<br> - I hate this picture.<br> I'll send you a new one.<br> How many bedrooms?<br> You've seen them all.<br> Wanna see the cellar? We don't have one.<br> I bet Momma would have been<br> a much better Anna Karenina. Emma stinks.<br> You're so stupid.<br> Mark, you know what this<br> fantastic little Russian's gonna do?<br> He's going to make it respectable<br> for American boys to be dancers.<br> See, on a good day I can do<br> entrechat sixes with double cabrioles.<br> - You beat me to it.<br> - Nice of her to have brought it.<br> - It's all she drinks now.<br> - You haven't talked to her yet.<br> I've been busy with the rest of the company.<br> Wayne, I love the company.<br> I don't want 'em to ever leave.<br> I wanna go with 'em. I miss 'em. I want...<br> Oh, what the hell. Your eyes.<br> Your ass.<br> Emma? Anybody seen Emma?<br> With all that experience<br> you're really a professional.<br> Would you like to take class<br> with the company in the morning?<br> Emilia, it's pointless to be shy.<br> You must know what you want<br> and say it.<br> - I know some things I want.<br> - Such as?<br> To take class with the company.<br> Had I understood 38 years ago<br> what I was getting myself into,<br> I'd never have started<br> this bloody ballet company.<br> I had just one thought.<br> "We need a first-class American company."<br> - But you've got a lot of foreigners in yours.<br> - Dance is international.<br> My company's almost gone under five times.<br> But here we are,<br> the best ballet company in the world.<br> Well, in this country, anyway.<br> - Is that the way you were brought up?<br> - Yes.<br> Your mother.<br> Well, I want her and your father<br> to introduce me to some rich oil folk.<br> They have a ballet school, dearie,<br> and that always means<br> a half a dozen rather lumpy little girls<br> with very rich daddies.<br> Now, I won't interfere<br> with their business, Janina.<br> I know how to handle the rich.<br> You give them hope, they give you money.<br> Don't put that ham away.<br> Save the commercial, Adelaide.<br> Janina hasn't got a penny.<br> - She should open a restaurant.<br> - Thank you.<br> It's a choreographer's prerogative<br> to keep his ideas to himself.<br> But, Arnold, must you be so secretive? Tell<br> us a little something about your new ballet.<br> There won't be a swan onstage.<br> - That's a little something.<br> - But not enough to guarantee you'll do it?<br> - Don't run, Adelaide.<br> - I told you Michael and I will do our best.<br> And I never run.<br> Deedee?<br> How do you get anywhere with her?<br> By realizing she knows<br> exactly what she's doing.<br> Oh, by the way, we'd like to have<br> a new ballet for Emma this season.<br> Oh, you don't have to use her, Arnold.<br> It's just a thought.<br> - Oh, were you pleased with Emma tonight?<br> - Yes, very.<br> I made Emma, Janina.<br> No, she didn't. Michael made Emma.<br> But you helped, Adelaide.<br> Booze brings out the nit-pickers.<br> I could have helped make you.<br> - Really, Mom?<br> - Were you as good as Emma, Mom?<br> - I was different.<br> - Very. From the day you both joined us.<br> Different how?<br> Your mother preferred to get married.<br> - Well, good night, all.<br> - I'll walk you to the car.<br> - Good night.<br> - Coming. Good night.<br> God, dancers have ugly feet. Ugh.<br> If I were a man, I could have had all the feet...<br> I mean children... I wanted, and still danced.<br> How many children?<br> Three. Like yours.<br> And a husband like Wayne.<br> Yes.<br> You're a very lucky girl.<br> Wanna change places?<br> No, I can't see you<br> teaching a pack of klutzy kids.<br> Or living in a town<br> where the company finally, finally comes.<br> And when they do, it's for a two-night stand.<br> No, you picked the life you wanted, Emma.<br> So did you.<br> No, not really.<br> You didn't let me.<br> - How not?<br> - "How not?"<br> We've picked up some fancy-schmancy<br> expressions along the way, haven't we?<br> Deedee...<br> I honestly don't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> - Remember Michael doing Anna Karenina?<br> - Yes, of course I do.<br> - Who did he rehearse for the part of Anna?<br> - You and me.<br> And?<br> And...<br> - You got pregnant.<br> - Yeah.<br> And you got 19 curtain calls.<br> Oh, Deedee.<br> Deedee...<br> - You resent me for that?<br> - No, not for that.<br> Would you like to change places?<br> I don't get 19 curtain calls any more.<br> But somebody will in something else,<br> and it won't be me.<br> Remember Dahkarova?<br> Well, she lives in an apartment<br> in Carnegie Hall that's as old as she is,<br> splattered with photographs<br> of herself as Giselle.<br> She coaches...<br> when she can.<br> She rents rooms to dancers when she can.<br> She was a great ballerina. She was our idol.<br> But Michael never considered her for Anna.<br> She was too old.<br> Exactly.<br> Well, that's a fact of life, Emma.<br> And I have to take class in the morning.<br> That's another fact of life.<br> Hi, Mom.<br> Ethan... Ethan?<br> Women aren't allowed in here.<br> I suppose the game was called<br> on account of rain.<br> It wasn't a game, only practice.<br> - You're gonna get kicked off the team.<br> - I won't.<br> - Oh, you think you're so valuable?<br> - No. But they do.<br> Get dressed. Out. Go home.<br> - It's Dad's advanced class.<br> - I know the schedule.<br> I'm not gonna miss that class,<br> so you can save your breath.<br> You save yours.<br> Now, get this straight, young man.<br> You wanna play baseball, finish practice.<br> You wanna dance, be on time.<br> I prefer baseball, because athletes last<br> a lot longer and make a lot more money,<br> but either way you follow the rules.<br> You got it?<br> I got it.<br> OK, second group, please.<br> See you in the rehearsal later. Bye.<br> Be ready.<br> Prparation. Music start.<br> Turn. Heel forward.<br> Continue. Come on, girls.<br> Together. Not too late.<br> Everywhere she's studied,<br> she's been on scholarship.<br> She studied with Carmelita<br> in Los Angeles, again on scholarship.<br> Thank you. Boys, please.<br> She's danced professionally<br> in Houston and Santa Fe.<br> Lots of money in Santa Fe.<br> And pause. Hold it. Pause.<br> Girls, continue immediately.<br> Arabesque. Feet close.<br> All the time in proper position.<br> Take the time right.<br> Good.<br> Proper ending,<br> and the whole combination to the left side.<br> Deedee and Wayne did a good job.<br> What do you think, Adelaide?<br> Dad, is it true that Yuri does doubles in the air<br> then a twist, and comes down on one knee?<br> - That's what I heard.<br> - Jesus.<br> My girlfriends couldn't care<br> if he did triples and landed in a split.<br> - They just like to see him in his tights.<br> - And you don't?<br> No. Dancers are boring. They're all in love<br> with themselves. It's those mirrors.<br> Dad, did you hear that?<br> Mom and Dad are teachers,<br> not dancers. You're neither.<br> - Is that so?<br> - As a matter of fact, yes.<br> - Mom...<br> - If you don't know by now...<br> - They asked me to join the company.<br> - Oh, Emilia.<br> Quiet. Quiet.<br> When do you start?<br> With rehearsals in New York<br> before the summer season.<br> But, Daddy, I didn't tell them I'd go.<br> - Jerk.<br> - Ethan!<br> - I said I wanted to think it over.<br> - Why, for God's sake?<br> 'Cause she's got more brains than you.<br> She knows it's the fork in her road.<br> - The what?<br> - Don't laugh. It is.<br> And I want to know where I'm going.<br> Right. Why shouldn't you?<br> That's very smart of you, Emilia.<br> Let's eat.<br> The air conditioner in the office<br> is still on the fritz.<br> Yeah, I know. Thanks, hon. They said<br> they'd fix it first thing in the morning.<br> They always say that,<br> they just never say which morning.<br> Why do you think she's hesitating<br> aboutjoining the company?<br> She won't say it<br> but she feels funny about leaving us.<br> I do too. Even funnier.<br> I have this image of Janina<br> going off to college, and then Ethan, and...<br> You know that Emma travels<br> with these three little dogs?<br> - Would you rather Emilia didn't go?<br> - No.<br> God, no.<br> I don't want her to spend the rest of her life<br> buried here in Oklahoma City.<br> I was thinking - if she does go,<br> you should go to New York for the summer.<br> You always baby her.<br> She doesn't make friends as easily as Janina.<br> She will, in the company.<br> There's always a lot ofjealousy<br> in the company.<br> Well, that never bothered you.<br> Why don't you go? Why should I go?<br> You know you wanna go,<br> you know we have to keep school open,<br> and you know<br> I'm a better teacher than you are.<br> Only in the summer.<br> It's too damn hot here for me.<br> Besides, I can't leave the other kids.<br> Well, Janina's happy as a clam here, and she<br> takes good care of the house. And Ethan...<br> Oh, Ethan would kill<br> to go to New York and study.<br> So?<br> You know me too well.<br> I would love to go there.<br> I think you have to.<br> - Are you trying to get rid of me?<br> - No, trying to hold onto you.<br> - I thought it over, but I have two questions.<br> - Sure.<br> Ethan says I'm scared of competition. I'm not.<br> But it's a big company,<br> so how much will I get to dance?<br> Depends on how good you are.<br> Well, how good am I?<br> Very. Now, what's the other question?<br> Should I know now<br> whether I want to stay in the company?<br> What made you ask that?<br> Well, it seems if you really stay,<br> there are things you have to give up.<br> You nut. You deal with that<br> when and if it happens.<br> But for now, if you know<br> what you want to do then you do it.<br> - It's not always that easy to know.<br> - Oh, it is for me.<br> I mean, I know what I want for now.<br> What?<br> Just to dance.<br> Then go ahead.<br> Left hand on the barre.<br> Shoulder down. Arm. And...<br> Grand pli.<br> One shoulder back.<br> Open. Look over your hand. Feet together.<br> Lift your arm. Port de bras. Front. One...<br> Watch.<br> No. In the middle of the movement. That's it.<br> Perfect.<br> OK, now dvelopp. Pull it up. Keep your pull.<br> One, two, three.<br> And one, two, three.<br> A little late. Three.<br> And one. Your toes will be in fifth position.<br> Last time. Again.<br> - Don't...<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - OK.<br> - That's enough.<br> How can you dance on it<br> if you can't even stand a Band-Aid?<br> And one, two, three, four,<br> five, six, seven, eight.<br> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...<br> Now, behave.<br> You're on a scholarship so be grateful.<br> I am. And it keeps me off the streets,<br> like you said.<br> You better not be so smartass<br> with your teachers.<br> So long, Mom.<br> - No.<br> - You don't wanna be seen with me?<br> - Don't you have anything better to do?<br> - Frankly, I don't.<br> Well, let me go first.<br> Control.<br> One. Stay.<br> And a-one.<br> Grand finale.<br> Shit.<br> Hello, Florence.<br> Is Adelaide around, by any chance?<br> No, sorry.<br> She had a fundraising meeting, Mrs Rodgers.<br> Deedee, Deedee.<br> ...five, six, seven, eight.<br> One, two, three, four,<br> five, six, seven, eight...<br> - Sevilla. How are you?<br> - Oh, hello.<br> That's as far as I got.<br> Interesting.<br> Thank you, everybody.<br> Shall I show you your solo now?<br> Please do.<br> You have three piqu turns<br> to two chans and pli.<br> - Arabesque. Preparation fourth.<br> - Double pirouette, right?<br> You can do a single.<br> I can do a double.<br> - Where do you want my head here?<br> - Down and to the side.<br> Fascinating.<br> You know, Arnold, it might help<br> if you told me what I was playing.<br> There's no story, Emma. It's abstract.<br> I'm aware of that. I asked what I was playing,<br> not who I was playing. What am I feeling?<br> Nothing, Emma. You just dance.<br> Arnold...<br> you've got the wrong lady.<br> Just watch your blood pressure, Arnold.<br> I did not say that if we don't use Emma,<br> we won't put on your ballet.<br> I did say that with Emma it will get<br> the serious attention it deserves.<br> Actually,<br> that's why you showed it to her, isn't it?<br> I was surprised Emma Jacklin<br> wanted to be in it.<br> Why? Emma's always worked<br> with young choreographers...<br> Michael.<br> I'm in bad need of a new ballet, Arnold,<br> and you know it.<br> Now, we're using each other, so play fair.<br> You're very talented.<br> Talented enough to change it, so that<br> you can use me at what I can do best. Now.<br> I'd like to, Emma, but it's not that simple.<br> - Your ambivalence is showing.<br> - Don't get bitchy.<br> - I'm not referring to your sex life.<br> - Ballets are for dancers, not to oblige stars.<br> I'm afraid Arnold wants his choreography<br> to be the only star.<br> It is, and it should be.<br> So you don't want me.<br> Well, then, it is that simple.<br> Your choreography looked very good<br> on Emilia. Use her. She'll surprise you.<br> Back to work.<br> The little bastard didn't even have the grace<br> to talk me into staying in his bloody ballet.<br> Drink slowly.<br> By the way, you and Freddie<br> aren't doing any Giselles this season.<br> - Trying to scare the hiccups out of me?<br> - No.<br> Sevilla's doing two,<br> then she alternates with...<br> Carolyn.<br> You picked a lovely time to tell me, Michael.<br> Better to get everything<br> dumped on you all at once.<br> Better for whom?<br> I'm the artistic director, Emma.<br> You tell me when and how<br> you'd say it to an artist you respect.<br> And a friend.<br> Poor Freddie.<br> You know we're only getting paid<br> by the performance this season.<br> No, I didn't know.<br> Well, the hiccups are gone, too.<br> Now, if I can just find<br> something to put these in...<br> You know, everything she has in here<br> is either an icon, a samovar or broken.<br> Usually all three.<br> - "D D Vanyo phone?"<br> - What?<br> That's what it says, I think.<br> Oh, that's from last night. You have to learn<br> how to break Dahkarova's code.<br> - "Wayne phoned."<br> - Yep.<br> He's so smart. He knew<br> if he gave me enough rope I'd hang myself.<br> - How's Janina?<br> - She's OK.<br> Crazy. Hates ballet, loves Oklahoma.<br> How did I raise one normal child?<br> Now, this will pass for a vase.<br> Oh, Em, if I could just get that teaching job.<br> And all I need is Adelaide's OK,<br> but I can't get the old bitch on the phone.<br> Who's she coaching?<br> Oh. The blonde, with the big eyes.<br> She's been coming over. Carolyn.<br> Yes.<br> I just heard Carolyn's going<br> to be doing Giselle this season.<br> Oh, dammit. I will not get the hiccups... again.<br> Put your arms up. How about<br> if I kill Adelaide? I'd like to anyway.<br> Don't blame Adelaide.<br> It's not her fault. I swore I'd quit at 35.<br> And 36, 37...<br> And then I closed my eyes.<br> How old were you<br> when you started taking lessons?<br> Eight.<br> I was seven.<br> - Our bodies always objected.<br> - I know.<br> But you didn't stay around long enough<br> to find out they revolt.<br> And too soon.<br> They just refuse to do what one wants.<br> They can't.<br> But even now, there are moments<br> when it comes together.<br> The music, the dancing...<br> the lights...<br> the costumes...<br> Well, you wanted to know<br> what it was like to be me.<br> Deedee, all I'm doing offstage<br> is just waiting to get back on.<br> How about a beer?<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> - No, tea.<br> - I'll make it.<br> - No, you sit.<br> - I'm gonna talk to Adelaide about yourjob.<br> - Don't talk to Adelaide about a damn thing.<br> Will you tell me something?<br> Why do the problems of people like you seem<br> so much more important than my problems?<br> - It's obvious. You're more important.<br> - Well, if I am, it's not for long.<br> A couple of years ago<br> Dahkarova was coaching me.<br> Today, Carolyn.<br> But next year...<br> Emilia.<br> - Emilia?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> She's really that good?<br> - I think she's gonna do it for you, Deedee.<br> - That's it, that's better.<br> Excuse me.<br> Mrs Rodgers, could...<br> - Emma, you're here.<br> - Still.<br> - What do you want, Carolyn?<br> - A glass of water, please.<br> Ah, kettle is boiling.<br> - Emma.<br> - Madame.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Why? It's not your fault.<br> - I understand.<br> - Yes. I understand too.<br> I went through the very same thing.<br> Carolyn.<br> - Cup of tea?<br> - Thank you, Emma.<br> Getting ready for my first performance<br> of Giselle is so difficult...<br> Stop talking. Sit.<br> - Any little cakes, Deedee?<br> - Cakes? Certainly. Anybody else?<br> - I'd love some. What kind do you...<br> - No.<br> - Hello, Momma.<br> - Hi, sweetie. How...<br> Emma. Hello, Mme Dahkarova. Hello, Carolyn.<br> Emma, Arnold was so mean after you left.<br> - But he'll give you the part?<br> - I knew it was your idea.<br> - Would you like some tea, darling? Emilia?<br> - Please.<br> - A lot of Arnold's scowls and mutterings?<br> - Yes.<br> - You'll get the part.<br> - What part?<br> - In Arnold's new ballet.<br> - Who, Arnold? Good ballet?<br> It's a good part for Emilia.<br> Then you must help and coach her.<br> All right.<br> I will.<br> But, Emma... you? Coaching?<br> Nonsense. I do it. It's necessary<br> to teach someone else be good like me.<br> But, Madame, you don't... You're not...<br> I don't what? I'm not what?<br> I think what Carolyn means is that<br> you don't dance any more and I do.<br> - Who helped you the most?<br> - Kschessinska.<br> From Mariinsky to me.<br> From me to you while I still was dancing.<br> Now to Carolyn, and very soon to you, Emilia,<br> if you work sur les pointes every day.<br> - Opening nights are so exciting.<br> - Aren't they?<br> I wish you were doing<br> the first Giselle tonight, not Sevilla.<br> It takes all the running you can do<br> to stay in the same place.<br> Pardon?<br> It's from Alice in Wonderland, dear.<br> - It goes down a little bit?<br> - No, itjust follows the natural line.<br> Yeah, just outjust a little bit.<br> - Can I try it again?<br> - Sure.<br> It's wonderful.<br> Remind me to ask you about something.<br> And one and two and three and four<br> and five and six and seven and eight.<br> And three. Two and three and four<br> and five and six and seven. Close eight.<br> A little faster.<br> - Not bad.<br> - Don't spoil me, dear.<br> Well, would you rather<br> I buttered you up like Adelaide does?<br> Why don't we butter each other up?<br> You're revolting. And about as subtle as she<br> is. This morning she came up to me and said:<br> "Sevilla, dearie, you're the greatest<br> prima ballerina in the whole world."<br> No, I am.<br> Gosh, that is awkward.<br> We ought to try that again, that lift.<br> The reason Adelaide goes on and on is<br> she knows I want to dance in Milan and Rio.<br> - She's determined I'll do that bloody tour.<br> - Well, you don't say no.<br> - That's exactly what Richard said.<br> - Who is Richard?<br> - Sevilla, long-distance phone call for you.<br> - Coming.<br> Excuse me, please. I won't be a moment.<br> Richard is why<br> I'm not going to end up like Emma.<br> I hate to be interrupted for phone calls.<br> Could I have the second cast, please?<br> Let's go from the wheelbarrow.<br> Ready? And...<br> You can turn on the light, it's OK.<br> - I didn't mean to wake you.<br> - You didn't.<br> I was with Yuri.<br> - Are you OK?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> I've been taking the pill.<br> Just in case.<br> Good God.<br> There's nothing to worry about.<br> Go to sleep now.<br> - Don't you wanna talk?<br> - No.<br> It might spoil it.<br> - Go back to bed. Sleep well.<br> - Oh, Emilia.<br> - Be glad for me, Momma.<br> - I am.<br> I am, I just didn't think it would...<br> it would be so soon that you...<br> That I what?<br> That you wouldn'tjust... wanna dance.<br> Oh, Mom.<br> Go back to bed.<br> Go on. It's OK.<br> Go on.<br> - How are you?<br> - OK.<br> Let's go.<br> About once a week,<br> Dad and I would check out all the new stuff.<br> And Emma and I would go up to the third<br> floor, try on all the most expensive dresses.<br> Once we stayed so long<br> we missed rehearsals...<br> Hey, I'll see you later.<br> ...stay up there for hours,<br> trying these dresses...<br> Oh, Rosie.<br> - Meet my children. This is Emilia and Ethan.<br> - Hi.<br> Joe Rosenberg, the conductor<br> of the company when Dad and I were in it.<br> - He was the best.<br> - I still am.<br> Only now I conduct musicals.<br> More bread and a permanent pad.<br> Hey, where are you goin'?<br> There. We live at Carnegie Hall.<br> How's your wife, Joe?<br> Which one? I've had two since I last saw you.<br> No. Well, how's all three of them?<br> Dynamite. I never see 'em.<br> - How's whatshisname?<br> - Wayne.<br> In Oklahoma with our other daughter.<br> We're here for the summer.<br> Terrific. I'm loose.<br> You gave up the ballet<br> to conduct on Broadway?<br> - You are a man without soul.<br> - And you are a woman without wine.<br> - Did he bring this wine?<br> - Yes, he brought it.<br> Taste, he got.<br> - You have much soul, darling.<br> - But not much taste.<br> Correct.<br> - I'll get it.<br> - "I'll get it."<br> Shut up.<br> Hello?<br> - Deedee, it's honor to Emilia.<br> - "Honor"?<br> - Yuri is the best dancer I know in years.<br> - Of course, my dear. He's Russian.<br> Correct.<br> And, believe it or not,<br> Linda's been accepted at Yale.<br> I guess nobody wants<br> to go to Princeton any more.<br> Well, obviously not my kids.<br> All five picked different schools,<br> but not one picks my alma mater.<br> - Would you say that was a reflection on me?<br> - No, Carter.<br> I'd say that was a reflection on Princeton.<br> You're biased.<br> For years.<br> - Excuse me, Miss Jacklin.<br> - Just put 'em down anywhere.<br> - Obviously I can't kiss you here.<br> - It wouldn't upset me.<br> It might upset Maggie.<br> Enough to give you a divorce?<br> All I'd have to do is ask for a divorce, Emma.<br> You know that.<br> Well?<br> - Would you give up dancing?<br> - Why not?<br> I asked you 15 years ago. 14 years ago. 13.<br> Ask me now.<br> You know, I...<br> I've always wondered -<br> what do you do with all these flowers?<br> Give them to hospitals.<br> Emma...<br> You know one of the reasons<br> we've lasted so long?<br> Tell me another, Carter.<br> Because the whole arrangement<br> has suited you. You liked the limitations.<br> I'm not so sure I do any more.<br> Well, now I do.<br> I'm sorry.<br> So am I.<br> Come in.<br> Well, I guess I'd better be running along.<br> Would you rather I didn't stop by later?<br> No, stop by.<br> We might as well finish out the season.<br> See you later.<br> Really, you are crazy. Stay.<br> - Yuri, my mother would have a fit.<br> - Then she is also crazy.<br> She's just a very proper lady.<br> - You're crazy. I can't.<br> - Yes.<br> - Half an hour, then.<br> - No, all night.<br> Please.<br> Why?<br> I'm homesick.<br> Now turn your back<br> to the new direction and look up.<br> Spot over your hand-arm line.<br> OK, good. Second group, please.<br> Let's do a port de bras. Be ready.<br> And...<br> Don't tighten your shoulder.<br> Very soft.<br> - You're late.<br> - Why you come so late?<br> Stuck in the bathroom.<br> - Boys, see the ink lighters?<br> - Lines. Together.<br> - They're flashing.<br> - Straight lines, please. Arms. Don't forget.<br> I had more than<br> just the hots for you back then.<br> But back then I didn't look so good in tights.<br> Now the toe shoe's on the other foot.<br> - Is it, now?<br> - Yeah.<br> Now we both don't look so good in tights.<br> - You speak for yourself.<br> - I am.<br> I can open up new vistas for you, my sweet.<br> Dancers are dumb.<br> I mean, what do you know?<br> Babies and ballet, right?<br> Well, what do you know<br> except for music and divorce, right?<br> One moment for station identification, please.<br> Books. Corruption. Dirty pictures.<br> Divorce is a bummer,<br> violets are blue.<br> Tchaikovsky is great...<br> and so are you.<br> That's nice. I needed that.<br> Back in the icebox age,<br> I had an apartment on West 52nd Street. You...<br> You left before the best part.<br> - You don't remember, do you?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> It was over ajazz joint.<br> Don't... leave now.<br> - Feel better?<br> - Much.<br> - It was my own fault, Yuri.<br> - Nah.<br> - I was so nervous.<br> - Why?<br> You're so fabulous. And I have weak knees.<br> I like girls with weak knees.<br> - You just like girls.<br> - Very much. Is wrong?<br> No. I personally think everyone should have<br> the right to make their own choice.<br> - I like yours.<br> - My what?<br> Your choice.<br> - I'm sorry. My English...<br> - No, it's mine. I have trouble sometimes.<br> Carolyn, you know,<br> it sometimes better... not to talk.<br> - I agree. And particularly with me, because...<br> - Carolyn.<br> Yes?<br> Hello?<br> - Emilia?<br> - Daddy.<br> Hi.<br> How are you? How's Janina?<br> Janina's taking care of me just fine.<br> And she's great at the school.<br> That's good.<br> Listen, I really had forgotten<br> how much later it is there.<br> Daddy, did you hear about<br> my part in the ballet?<br> - Yeah, Ma wrote that you got the lead.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, don't let that Arnold Berger scare you.<br> You just sic your boyfriend on him, OK?<br> How is he, by the way?<br> He's OK. I don't really have time<br> for that sort of thing.<br> I don't wonder. You know, they always work<br> you a lot harder when you're really good.<br> Put Ma on for a minute, will you?<br> Mom's with Emma. They're always yakking.<br> Sometimes she even stays over.<br> Yeah, well, that's good.<br> You have her call me when she gets a chance,<br> OK? Meantime, you get back to bed, and...<br> Daddy, could you come to New York soon?<br> You bet, honey.<br> Soon as school finishes, Janina and I are<br> gonna get on the first plane out of here. OK?<br> Yes. I love you, Daddy.<br> I love you too.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Up late?<br> Good morning, darling.<br> Daddy called last night.<br> I told him you were with Emma.<br> - Why didn't you wake me?<br> - It was very late.<br> Daddy and Janina send their love.<br> Emilia, what time are you<br> having your lunch today?<br> I'm busy.<br> Goodbye, Madame, Ethan.<br> Something's funny.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> Two, two, three four.<br> Three, two, three, four.<br> Four, two, three four.<br> Five, two, three, four.<br> Six, two, three, four.<br> Emilia...<br> all that emotion is terrific...<br> for the mad scene in Giselle, not for my ballet.<br> You're not an uptight village virgin. You're<br> just a body moving in space with music.<br> Not to music, with music.<br> That's what dancing is. So please<br> don't fly around the room emoting.<br> Don't think. Just move as I tell you to move<br> to the counts I give you. OK?<br> I don't count.<br> Then how do you know<br> what to do when? ESP?<br> I feel it, with the music. And I make it fit.<br> Well, don't feel it. Count it.<br> Where were we, Peter?<br> Bar 132... with no feeling, please.<br> - Look over here. Cute, ain't she?<br> - She's real pretty.<br> - Howdy.<br> - Howdy.<br> I was wondering if you could<br> settle a little wager we just made.<br> We're from out of town,<br> and we bet you are too.<br> Right?<br> See, I knew it.<br> Bartender, get us another round over here.<br> - This is...<br> - I'm Barney Joe. Lake Charles, Louisiana.<br> And...<br> I'm Bill Britt, from Amarillo, West Texas.<br> Pleased to meet you, ma'am.<br> Where are you from?<br> Leningrad, Soviet Union.<br> No kidding? What are you doing here?<br> I need artistic freedom.<br> Hey, what are you, anyway?<br> Artist. Is why I need artistic freedom.<br> That blows me away.<br> Now, what are you<br> saving them cherries for?<br> I save them for supper.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - What?<br> - Is time to go.<br> - Oh, no, don't leave.<br> Hey, you forgot your...<br> You forgot your briefcase.<br> Listen, why don't you come on back, now?<br> I have a marvelous man for that, Sevilla.<br> No injections, Emma.<br> I faint at the sight of a needle.<br> Just massage.<br> I'll leave his number in your room.<br> - Thank you, darling.<br> - Clear the stage.<br> Would everyone clear the stage?<br> Take the house to half. Conductor, stand by.<br> Hi.<br> What in the world did you take?<br> Cherries, for remembrance.<br> Let me out of here.<br> - Here.<br> - It's cold in here.<br> You can do it. You can do it.<br> Five. Six. Seven. Eight.<br> Something's wrong.<br> I'm not quite sure, but she's really wonked.<br> Sorry.<br> Take this. Hang on. You'll be OK.<br> Not a word to Adelaide. I'll tell you<br> all about it in my dressing room. Bye-bye.<br> - Emilia...<br> - She's OK.<br> Go.<br> Yes, I agree.<br> The right partner is absolutely essential.<br> And Michael was so good for me.<br> - What happened?<br> - He became a choreographer.<br> Now, my dear child...<br> you should get some sleep.<br> Oh, not yet.<br> I meant, what happened<br> between you and Michael?<br> - Priorities.<br> - He liked boys better than girls?<br> Not then. I... Well, how should I know?<br> We didn't talk about it<br> quite so openly in those days.<br> I meant Michael knew<br> that my priority was dancing.<br> Are you sorry?<br> No, I don't believe in being sorry.<br> We are what we are.<br> Am I like you?<br> I don't know.<br> - Now, listen, shouldn't you call home?<br> - I'd only wake Ethan.<br> Emma, I've stayed at Yuri's a lot.<br> Emilia, you continually surprise me.<br> And me.<br> I wish I knew who I was.<br> - You will.<br> - When?<br> Something happens.<br> There's always a moment.<br> - Maybe when Yuri wants to come back.<br> - I don't want him back.<br> Course, I'd love to dance with him,<br> and I love going to bed with him.<br> But I wanted it to be more,<br> and that gets in the way, doesn't it?<br> Which do you want the most?<br> Both? Well, that's something to dream about.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Emma?<br> It's so nice here.<br> I'm glad.<br> ...I have simply got to reach him.<br> - May I?<br> - Of course.<br> - Hello, Emma.<br> - Michael, your call to London.<br> I'll take it here.<br> Emma, look at the poster Michael unearthed.<br> Our very first gala performance.<br> - You were still dancing. You too, Michael.<br> - You were in the corps de ballet.<br> Well, I'm behind a desk now.<br> Never mind. We've all kept this company<br> going, and that's what matters.<br> Yes, another year, another gala.<br> They remind me of the Olympics.<br> Dearie, you're not nervous after all this time?<br> All right, I'll call back in an hour.<br> This is going to be a super gala.<br> Marcia and Richard<br> are coming from Stuttgart, and...<br> - Do you suppose they'll travel tourist?<br> - Now, Adelaide.<br> I hear you're also going to do<br> Arnold's new ballet.<br> Dearie...<br> No, no. I was just wondering<br> if Emilia was going to be invited to the party.<br> So she will.<br> It's very pretty.<br> Why are you angry?<br> - Why are you?<br> - I'm not.<br> You damn well are, you're just<br> covering it up with ice, like Emma.<br> That horny little Russian behaved<br> like a bastard so you take it out on me.<br> I didn't hide anything from you.<br> I brought Rosie here. You knew exactly...<br> - I gotta wash my hair.<br> - Come here. Come here, Emilia.<br> You'll sit down. I wanna talk,<br> you'll listen to me. I'm still your mother.<br> When Daddy and Janina come,<br> do you want them to see us like this?<br> You wanna hurt them too?<br> - Talk. Can we talk it out?<br> - There's nothing to talk about.<br> Stop punishing me.<br> Look at me.<br> Look at me, please.<br> You know, Daddy and I have been<br> away from each other all summer.<br> Daddy wouldn't do what you did.<br> - How do you know?<br> - I know Daddy.<br> Like you know Yuri?<br> I'm the only louse?<br> Come on, Emilia. Be fair.<br> You hurt, I... I know.<br> And I understand. I can help you.<br> Let me. Don't shut me out, sweetheart.<br> We're friends.<br> Nobody can help you better than I can.<br> Nobody knows you better than I do. Nobody.<br> Momma. You're really just<br> angry about Emma, aren't you?<br> No.<br> Emilia, I love you.<br> I may have seemed like a monster,<br> but it was to help you understand what my<br> ballet is, not what you wanted to make it. I...<br> Bravo, Arnold. Keep talking like that.<br> She'll be more hysterical.<br> - I'm not hysterical.<br> - I'm not hysterical either.<br> - I don't know why you're not.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> Maybe you're right. Some lousy gala,<br> biggest night of season.<br> It's only your biggest opportunity...<br> Emilia's biggest opportunity...<br> It's really nothing special.<br> - I have to go to the john again.<br> - Are you all right?<br> Don't worry about him. He'll be all right.<br> I have little secret for you. You know,<br> I think it's perfectly all right to be nervous.<br> - Really?<br> - Really. I know.<br> Dance well.<br> I'm not at all surprised. You know,<br> if we sell out the last two weeks,<br> we end the season<br> with a deficit of less than 80,000.<br> - Imagine.<br> - About the price of your necklace.<br> Oh, no, Dennis. This is paste.<br> The real one went for...<br> - What did it go for, Michael?<br> - The musicians' strike.<br> Oh, yes. Pigs.<br> Oh, hello, Mrs Stewart. I love the Stewarts.<br> They gave us $25,000 last year.<br> Emilia?<br> Oh, don't you look nice.<br> - You should see the glamour out front.<br> - I don't wanna think about it.<br> - You're doing Anna.<br> - The suicide scene.<br> All the other ladies will be in short tutus<br> and do at least a hundred pirouettes.<br> So this not-so-young lady will be<br> covered to the floor and act up a storm.<br> This is a knockout.<br> Wanna be my date for the party?<br> - Or do you have one?<br> - No, that's kaput.<br> Terrific dress you gave Emilia, too.<br> But you shouldn't have.<br> Why not? She's my godchild.<br> You just shouldn't have, that's all. Good luck.<br> Even now, there are moments<br> when it all comes together.<br> The dancing, the music, the lights...<br> Your mother chose to get married.<br> You got 19 curtain calls.<br> And you got pregnant.<br> I can't watch it any more.<br> They're too old for it. That depresses me.<br> I'm too old to do another one.<br> That depresses me more.<br> It's a beautiful ballet, Michael.<br> It'll live forever.<br> Why can't we?<br> Why aren't you watching?<br> It hurts. I keep seeing me and Emma<br> rehearsing for you.<br> Hey, if I ask you a question,<br> will you answer me truthfully?<br> What?<br> Jesus, can you believe this?<br> I've wanted to ask it for 20 years.<br> OK.<br> If I hadn't been pregnant, would you have<br> used me as Anna instead of Emma?<br> I don't remember, Deedee.<br> Honestly, I don't.<br> I wish to God I didn't.<br> Hurry up. You're going to miss my ballet.<br> I think she's gonna do it for you, Deedee.<br> It's wonderful.<br> I've gotta take my bow.<br> - To Emilia, dearie.<br> - I'm so glad for her.<br> Tradition is continuity,<br> and thank God I've lived to see it.<br> Second generation in our own family.<br> And yours, of course. Now,<br> what should we do with our baby ballerina?<br> I think she'd be lovely in Sleeping Beauty.<br> Perfect. We'll warm her up this season,<br> and then she'll warm up the box office<br> the next season.<br> - Do you want to tell her?<br> - No.<br> - I think it's a fabulous idea.<br> - I do too.<br> Isn't it wonderful? Aren't you excited?<br> I'm so proud of you. I was so excited...<br> - Has anyone seen my bitch of a wife?<br> - Now, dearie.<br> Very smart of you to do Anna.<br> Next time you'll have to lift me, Emma.<br> My back is ready for traction.<br> - Oh, poor Freddie.<br> - It's worth it.<br> - You know what we'd like you to do, Emma?<br> - A new ballet?<br> - Tradition makes a company...<br> - This is "tradition" night.<br> Oh, shut up, Michael.<br> I'd like to restore the full-length<br> Sleeping Beauty to our repertoire.<br> Oh, thank you very much,<br> but I don't think I could dance that any more.<br> No. But you could stage it.<br> You know it inside out.<br> It'd be fun, a new challenge.<br> She'd do it beautifully.<br> Don't you think so, Michael?<br> I think your timing's lousy, Adelaide.<br> Excuse me.<br> I really must do something to my face.<br> For God's sake, Adelaide.<br> Dearie, even Emma has to move on.<br> Like all the rest of us.<br> Hello, Deedee.<br> Champagne, please.<br> Emma?<br> Do you remember the fairy tales<br> we used to take turns reading to Emilia?<br> Like the one about the two princesses?<br> Every time one would open her mouth,<br> out came diamonds and rubies.<br> Every time the other one opened her mouth,<br> out came newts and hoptoads.<br> Newts and hoptoads, coming out.<br> Yes.<br> One of those little toads<br> has already made an appearance.<br> - Really? When?<br> - Tonight, in my dressing room.<br> When you said I shouldn't have<br> bought that dress for Emilia.<br> Twice you said it. Just before a performance.<br> I danced better tonight than I have in years.<br> So I heard.<br> Another little toad. You must have kept<br> quite a few bottled up all these years.<br> No.<br> Embalmed, really.<br> No, I think not.<br> Why don't you let them out?<br> I don't have a performance tomorrow.<br> OK.<br> Pick.<br> This is a tiny little one.<br> I'd practically forgotten him.<br> Why'd you make your best pal doubt herself?<br> And her hubby? Why, Emma?<br> Why'd you take the chance<br> of lousing up her marriage?<br> Why'd you say, "You better have that baby.<br> If you don't you'll never hold onto Wayne?"<br> I'm just curious.<br> You have a curious memory.<br> But don't we all. As I remember, I said if you<br> had an abortion you might lose Wayne.<br> No. That's sweet, but that's inaccurate.<br> I remember exactly your words.<br> For lo, these too many moons.<br> And eventually I figured out why you<br> said 'em, because I also remember...<br> that you said, " Forget about Michael's ballet,<br> there'll be others."<br> You clever little twinkle-toes.<br> You knew a ballet like that comes along<br> once in a career, and you wanted it.<br> Real bad.<br> So you lied to make sure<br> you got what you wanted.<br> I never had to lie to get what I wanted.<br> I'm too good.<br> Really.<br> Yes.<br> And I suppose if you said "bullshit"<br> you'd say it in French, wouldn't you?<br> If that word came as naturally to me as to you<br> I'd have used it several times by now.<br> In English.<br> But I think it's more appropriate<br> that you say it to yourself,<br> for trying to blame me for what you did.<br> Deedee, the choice was yours.<br> It's much too late to regret it now.<br> The same to you, Emma, me darlin'.<br> I don't regret mine.<br> Then why are you trying<br> to become a mother at your age?<br> That's not a little toad.<br> That's rather a large bullfrog.<br> I don't wanna be anybody's mother.<br> I think of Emilia as a friend.<br> And one reason I tried to help - stupid me -<br> I thought you'd be happy if your daughter<br> became what you never could be.<br> Meaning you. It's so lovely to be you?<br> - Well, obviously you think so.<br> - No.<br> And anyway, I doubt if<br> Emilia could become you.<br> She's as talented as you are,<br> and she works as hard.<br> There's one thing, dearest friend, that you are,<br> that Emilia, poor darling, is not.<br> And what, pray tell, is that?<br> A killer.<br> You'd walk over anybody<br> and still get a good night's sleep.<br> That exactly how you got<br> where you are, Emma.<br> Good girl.<br> Deedee...<br> Deedee...<br> - I'm sick to death of yourjealousy.<br> - So am I.<br> Stop blaming your life on me. You picked it.<br> You picked it. You never let me<br> find out if I was good enough.<br> - You weren't. That's why you married Wayne.<br> - I loved Wayne.<br> So you said to hell with your career<br> and got pregnant to prove you meant it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Don't lie to me, lie to yourself.<br> You knew you were second-rate.<br> You got pregnant because Wayne<br> was a dancer and that meant "queer" then.<br> - To prove he was a man, you had a baby.<br> - That's a goddamn lie.<br> It's the truth and you know it. You saddled<br> him with a baby and blew his career.<br> Now she's better than you were<br> and you're jealous.<br> You're certifiable.<br> You'll use any excuse.<br> - What excuse?<br> - For trying to take away my child.<br> - I return the compliment. You're a liar.<br> - And you're a user. You know that?<br> You're a user, and you always have been.<br> First me, and then Michael.<br> Pretending to be in love with Michael.<br> Then Adelaide, and now Emilia.<br> - How Emilia?<br> - "How Emilia."<br> That display five minutes ago, upstairs.<br> Curtsy, embrace, applause.<br> It wasn't for her, it was for you.<br> You were using Emilia so that everybody in<br> the room would say, "Isn't Emma wonderful?"<br> You are wonderful. You are really amazing.<br> It is incredible how you keep going on.<br> You're over the hill and you know it.<br> You're terrified.<br> All you've got are your scrapbooks,<br> your old toe shoes and those ridiculous dogs.<br> What are you going to fill in with, Emma?<br> Not my daughter. You keep<br> your goddamn hands off my daughter.<br> - I'm better for Emilia then you are.<br> - The hell you are.<br> She came to me 'cause her mother wasn't<br> there. She was busy screwing her head off.<br> You bitch.<br> You know, if there'd been a photographer<br> here, you'd have had a whole new career.<br> I must look awful.<br> No, you don't. You look beautiful.<br> I don't know how you do it.<br> Give me your comb, I'll show you.<br> I'll take this half. Thank you.<br> I lost an earring.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - I'm not.<br> - You're not?<br> No. I'm not.<br> Boy, thatjealousy.<br> Its poison, you know?<br> - It can make you a monster.<br> - It does make one unfair.<br> You got off some bull's-eyes.<br> So did you.<br> Deedee...<br> I don't really remember<br> what I said about having the baby.<br> But I do know...<br> I would have said anything<br> to make sure I got that ballet.<br> I just had to have it.<br> You were good. Good enough to threaten me.<br> Jesus...<br> Emma, you don't know...<br> how many years<br> I wanted to hear you say... just that.<br> Next bus to midtown Manhattan<br> in 30 minutes.<br> Emma had her all morning, coaching her.<br> Dahkarova's got her this afternoon.<br> - What's all the coaching for?<br> - OK, surprise.<br> Your daughter is dancing with Yuri<br> on the 15th.<br> - He'll wipe her out.<br> - The hell he will.<br> Emma and Dahkarova<br> have knocked themselves out.<br> - Ethan, show Janina her room, please.<br> - Sure.<br> You're going to love it here...<br> You wanna see something wonderful? Come.<br> Left, right, left, right.<br> OK?<br> Now, left shoulder. And...<br> Left, right. No...<br> So remember, it's left, right, left, right.<br> You must do it so that really you shine.<br> Like diamond, you know?<br> OK. And...<br> One. One. One.<br> More close. Close.<br> That's right, that's right, that's right.<br> More this way, this,<br> instead of this and this, OK?<br> Just very sharp. One.<br> Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.<br> That's very good. That's good.<br> No, it is good.<br> You think she can make it, Wayne?<br> Will you care if she doesn't?<br> No.<br> As long as she doesn't.<br> Still care you didn't?<br> Emma said I married you<br> 'cause I knew I couldn't.<br> That's not true.<br> She said something else.<br> She said I got pregnant<br> that first time with Emilia...<br> because I wanted to prove to everybody...<br> that you weren't gay.<br> And that's partly true.<br> I knew that.<br> You did?<br> I had to prove it too.<br> So I let you ruin your career.<br> No, I saddled you with a family.<br> You could have been something...<br> Me? No, no, no, never. Not me.<br> Hey, I got what I wanted.<br> So did I.<br> - Why you don't ask me?<br> - Adelaide hates to pay overtime.<br> How you supposed to rehearse<br> without partner?<br> You make too much from Carolyn and me.<br> But I apologize anyway.<br> Keep doing. Come, come, come on.<br> So...<br> - Can we have supper?<br> - I'm busy.<br> - After supper?<br> - Bed.<br> OK.<br> Emilia...<br> Is joke.<br> I don't think so.<br> Come on. And...<br> That's no joke.<br> Nice?<br> Yes.<br> So smile.<br> Let's go on.<br> Bravo.<br> Emilia, it was marvelous. It was so<br> wonderful. You... Wasn't she wonderful?<br> Up these stairs and to the left.<br> Just one more kiss.<br> Just one more kiss.<br> It was so good. Now it's all done.<br> Emilia. You were so good.<br> - You were so good.<br> - I just loved you.<br> And there he is. There's Yuri.<br> Yuri, this is my sister Janina.<br> You got it? You're kidding me.<br> You got his autograph?<br> You were absolutely wonderful, dearie.<br> You were incredible.<br> That was beautiful...<br> Pick a feeling.<br> Envy.<br> Her life is just beginning.<br> It's not a very long one, Deedee.<br> I know.<br> Well, as long as it gives her what she wants.<br> It will.<br> It will.<br> Oh, Emma.<br> If only she knew everything we know.<br> It wouldn't matter a damn.<br>
