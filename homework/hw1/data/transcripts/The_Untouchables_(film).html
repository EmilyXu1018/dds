                        An article, which I believe appeared<br> in a newspaper, asked why,<br> since it would seem that you are<br> in effect the Mayor of Chicago,<br> you're not simply being<br> appointed to that position.<br> Well, I tell ya, it's touching.<br> Like a lot of things in life,<br> we laugh because it's funny,<br> and we laugh because it's true.<br> Some people say,<br> reformers here say:<br> "Put that man in jail,<br> what does he think he is doing?"<br> What I hope I'm doing, and here's<br> where your paper's got a point,<br> is I'm responding to<br> the will of the people.<br> People are gonna drink. We all<br> know that. All I do is act on that.<br> And all this talk of bootlegging.<br> What is bootlegging?<br> On the boat it's bootlegging,<br> on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.<br> I'm a businessman.<br> Your reputation is that you control<br> your business through violence.<br> That those that don't purchase your<br> product are dealt with violently.<br> It's all right.<br> I grew up in a tough neighborhood.<br> We used to say, "You can get further<br> with a kind word and a gun"<br> "than you can<br> with just a kind word."<br> And in that neighborhood<br> it might've been true.<br> And sometimes<br> your reputation follows you.<br> There is violence in Chicago,<br> but not by me<br> and not by anybody I employ.<br> Because it's not good business.<br> Leave us alone down here,<br> we've got everything we need.<br> The green beer you're peddlin'<br> ain't any good.<br> It's not supposed to be good.<br> It's supposed to be bought.<br> I'm not buyin' any.<br> Don't worry about it, Pops,<br> we won't come back.<br> - How's everyone at your house today?<br> - They're fine.<br> - Is your Mama well?<br> - She has a little cold.<br> Oh, she does?<br> - I'm sorry to hear that.<br> - But she'll be all right.<br> - There you go.<br> - Thank you.<br> That's all right, sweetie.<br> You be careful crossin' the street.<br> - Mister!<br> - You tell your Mama that...<br> Hey, Mister! Wait!<br> Mister! Wait!<br> You forgot your brief...<br> Yes, I heard it on the radio.<br> I know.<br> Now it's time to go to work.<br> You'll make a good first impression.<br> I love you, Eliot.<br> Now, shoo.<br> Eliot Ness, Special Agent<br> of the Treasury Department.<br> - Mr. Ness.<br> - Thank you, Chief.<br> At the request<br> of the City of Chicago,<br> the Department of the Treasury<br> has inaugurated a programme<br> to deal with the flow of illegal<br> liquor and the violence it creates.<br> Mr. Ness!<br> Of what does this programme consist?<br> I and other agents of the Treasury<br> will be working<br> with the Chicago Police...<br> Isn't it just another<br> showpiece programme?<br> - What do you think of prohibition?<br> - Do you drink, Mr. Ness?<br> - Come on, answer the questions.<br> - It's not just a showpiece.<br> And I'll tell you<br> how I feel about prohibition.<br> It is the law of the land.<br> Do you consider yourself<br> a crusader, is that it?<br> What qualifications<br> do you have for the job?<br> Do you have any political ambitions?<br> All right, boys,<br> I think that's enough.<br> What are your real plans?<br> What have you got coming up?<br> You'll have to read about it<br> in the paper.<br> - Let me ride along with you.<br> - No. Can't help you.<br> Mr. Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,<br> the Flying Squad.<br> Are you ready to meet the men?<br> Yes, I am.<br> I have one more thing to say.<br> I know that many of you take a drink.<br> What you've done before today<br> is not my concern.<br> But now we must be pure,<br> and I want you to stop.<br> It's not a question of whether it's<br> 'a harmless drink'. It may well be.<br> But it's against the law.<br> And as we are going to enforce<br> the law, we must do first by example.<br> Are there any questions?<br> Good. The Department<br> of the Treasury's had<br> a man undercover here<br> for some time now.<br> We've received word<br> from this informant<br> that a large shipment of Canadian<br> whiskey has arrived in Chicago.<br> So I hope that you have signed on<br> for some action.<br> Remember, the liquor cases<br> are marked with the red maple leaf.<br> The Treasury Agent is<br> in a grey suit with a white scarf.<br> - He is not to be arrested.<br> - A grey suit and a white scarf.<br> - That's it. Are your men ready?<br> - Yes, sir. They are.<br> - At ease.<br> - Smoke 'em if you got 'em.<br> - How are we doin'?<br> - Okay.<br> - Want part of a sandwich?<br> - No, thank you, sir.<br> - You nervous?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Been with the unit long?<br> - A short while.<br> - I suppose we all want to do well.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> A message from my wife.<br> - You married?<br> - Yes, sir, I am.<br> Nice to be married, huh?<br> Just follow me.<br> - Oh, God...<br> - Federal officer. Hands in the air.<br> Get 'em up. Drop it.<br> Damn it, I can't, it'll break.<br> Mr. Ness. Look, I was just...<br> Geez, I'm sorry.<br> Listen, I can do a lot for you,<br> what you're tryin' to do.<br> I get the big scoop,<br> you make a big splash.<br> Get some support. What do you say?<br> Let's be real, let me help you.<br> Okay. Just shut up.<br> All right now...<br> Let's do some good!<br> Hold it right there!<br> Federal officer. You're under arrest<br> for violations of the Volstead Act.<br> Let's cover the doors!<br> Don't let anybody out!<br> Preseuski.<br> - I'm here with permission.<br> - Who gave you permission?<br> - Mr. Ness!<br> - Sorry, let him through here.<br> Let him through here.<br> You want to take your picture,<br> take it now.<br> - You ready?<br> - Ready.<br> Liquor, huh?<br> Get him out of here.<br> - Tear the place apart!<br> - I mean now, get him out!<br> That means you, too.<br> Christ!<br> Now, what do you think you're doing?<br> You want to throw garbage? Throw it<br> in the goddamn trash basket.<br> Don't you have<br> more important things to do?<br> Yeah.<br> But I'm not doing them right now.<br> Do we understand each other?<br> Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?<br> - Why are you packin' the gun?<br> - I'm a Treasury Officer.<br> All right.<br> Just remember<br> what we talked about now.<br> Hey... Wait a minute!<br> What the hell kind of police<br> do you have in this goddamn city?<br> You just turned your back<br> on an armed man.<br> - You're a Treasury officer.<br> - I just told you I was.<br> Who would claim to be that,<br> who was not?<br> What's your name and unit?<br> It's right here.<br> You got a beef?<br> What is it?<br> How did you know I had a gun?<br> What do you want,<br> a free lesson in police work?<br> No.<br> Are you okay, pal?<br> I had a rough day on the job.<br> - Are you going home now?<br> - I was about to.<br> Well, then, you just fulfilled<br> the first rule of law enforcement.<br> Make sure when your shift is over<br> you go home alive.<br> Here endeth the lesson.<br> $100,000 for 40 barrels.<br> Make sure there are no empties.<br> I'm gonna give you the ledger,<br> everything is in the book.<br> - It's Eddie.<br> - Come in, Eddie.<br> So, he gets into the snowplough,<br> and he says, "Let's do some good".<br> And then, we bust through...<br> - Mr. Ness?<br> - Yes?<br> I came here to thank you.<br> It was...<br> ...my little girl that got killed<br> with that bomb.<br> I'm sorry. Please.<br> I'm... I'm so sorry.<br> You see, it's... because I know<br> that you have children, too.<br> And that this is real for you,<br> that these men cause us tragedy.<br> And I know that you will<br> put a stop to them.<br> And you do that, now.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I'd like to talk to you.<br> Come in.<br> I need a small group of men,<br> handpicked, starting with you.<br> Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.<br> - Now, how can I help you?<br> - Just work with me.<br> - But why should I, though?<br> - Because you're a good cop.<br> - How do you know that?<br> - You told me.<br> If I'm such a good cop...<br> How come I'm walkin' the beat,<br> then, at my age?<br> Do you want to tell me?<br> Well, maybe I'm that<br> Whore with a Heart of Gold.<br> Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?<br> Is that what you want to hear?<br> I didn't ask you, and I don't care!<br> You want to stay on the beat?<br> You do that.<br> If you'd like to come with me,<br> I need your help.<br> I'm askin' you for help.<br> Well... that's the thing you fear,<br> isn't it?<br> Mr. Ness, I wish I'd met you<br> ten years and... twenty pounds ago.<br> But... I just think it got...<br> more important to me...<br> ...to stay alive.<br> And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.<br> Thank you, no.<br> That's good, Andy. Let's start up<br> the thing and take a little ride.<br> I wanna hear<br> that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!<br> - Yeah, let me open the door here.<br> - Yeah, go ahead.<br> Whoopsy daisy,<br> pick up the door there, Andy.<br> Throw it in the back seat.<br> Now, let me get the thing started.<br> Yeah, start it up, Andy.<br> Holy mackerel, Andy!<br> Listen to that Bearcat motor!<br> Yeah, it sounds like the bear<br> is chasin' that cat all round it!<br> Andy! She's boilin' over!<br> - Mr. Ness?<br> - Yes.<br> Oscar Wallace.<br> I've been assigned here<br> by the Washington Bureau.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, I'm glad to have you here,<br> Mr. Wallace. Would you excuse me?<br> We are a little in the dark here,<br> but any ideas you may have...<br> Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.<br> And the one I want to try first...<br> is this.<br> He has not filed a return since 1926.<br> - A return?<br> - An income tax return.<br> - Income tax.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - What do you do at the Bureau?<br> - Oh, I'm an accountant.<br> - An accountant?<br> - Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...<br> Would you excuse me?<br> Please.<br> Okay. Let's go.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - These walls have ears.<br> You said you wanted to know<br> how to get Capone.<br> Do you really want to get him?<br> You see what I'm saying?<br> - What are you prepared to do?<br> - Everything within the law.<br> And then what are you<br> prepared to do?<br> If you open the ball<br> on these people,<br> you must be prepared<br> to go all the way.<br> Because they won't give up the fight<br> until one of you is dead.<br> I want to get Capone.<br> I don't know how.<br> Here's how you get Capone:<br> He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.<br> He sends one of yours to hospital,<br> you send one of his to the morgue!<br> That's the Chicago way!<br> And that's how you get Capone.<br> Now, do you want to do that?<br> Are you ready to do that?<br> I'm making you a deal.<br> Do you want this deal?<br> I have sworn to put this man away,<br> with any and all legal means<br> at my disposal, and I will do so.<br> Well, the Lord hates a coward.<br> Do you know what a blood oath is,<br> Mr. Ness?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good. 'Cause you just took one.<br> How do you think Capone knew<br> about your raid the other night?<br> - Somebody on the cops told him.<br> - Right. Welcome to Chicago.<br> This town stinks<br> like a whorehouse at low tide.<br> First, who can you trust?<br> Nobody. The cops, nobody.<br> - 'Cause nobody wants you here.<br> - Then why are you helping me?<br> Because I swore to uphold the law.<br> And if you believe that,<br> I'll tell you another.<br> - Now, who can you trust?<br> - I can trust nobody.<br> - That's the sorry truth.<br> - Then, where are we gonna get help?<br> If you're afraid of getting a rotten<br> apple, don't go to the barrel.<br> Get it off the tree.<br> Get it off the tree...<br> Finger out of the trigger guard!<br> Eject those cartridges!<br> Lay the revolver on the ledge<br> and stand back!<br> About face!<br> Barry! I want you to meet<br> Mr. Eliot Ness.<br> Treasury Department. How are you?<br> We need a recruit for extended duty.<br> He is to be seconded to the Treasury<br> Department. We have the full...<br> Barry? Who is consistently<br> the best shot of this class?<br> - Williamson and Stone.<br> - Call them out, one at a time.<br> - Are either of the men married?<br> - No.<br> - Good.<br> - Williamson!<br> - You're married.<br> - I don't want any married men.<br> All right, stand easy, son.<br> I want to ask you something.<br> - Why do you want to join the force?<br> - To protect and...<br> To protect and serve...<br> To protect and...<br> Please don't search for the yearbook<br> answer. Just tell me what you think.<br> - What I think? I...<br> - You...<br> ...could help... the force.<br> - You can help...<br> - With the force.<br> Thank you.<br> There goes the next Chief of Police.<br> At ease!<br> Stone! Out here.<br> This kid's a prodigy.<br> - Why do you want to join the force?<br> - To protect the property and...<br> Oh, please, don't waste my time<br> with that bullshit.<br> Where are you from, Stone?<br> - From the Southside.<br> - Stone?<br> George Stone, that's your name?<br> - What's your real name?<br> - That is my real name.<br> Nah! What was it<br> before you changed it?<br> - Giuseppe Petri.<br> - Geez, I knew it!<br> That's all you need,<br> one thieving wop on the team!<br> What's that you said?<br> I said that you're a lyin' member<br> of a no-good race.<br> That's much better than you,<br> you stinkin' Irish pig.<br> Oh, I like him.<br> Yeah, I like him, too.<br> You just joined<br> the Treasury Department, son.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> Eliot Ness.<br> With reports from stake-outs<br> on the North and West side, and...<br> Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.<br> What do you think?<br> I think there's nothing<br> like vaudeville.<br> - That's what I think.<br> - Now, are you ready to go to work?<br> - Where are we going?<br> - On a liquor raid.<br> We need another man.<br> Mr. Ness? This is very interesting.<br> I've found a financial disbursement<br> pattern which shows some irregu...<br> - You carry a badge?<br> - Yes.<br> Carry a gun.<br> - Jimmy?<br> - What?<br> What the hell are you dressed for?<br> Hallowe'en?<br> Shut up. I'm working.<br> Where? The circus?<br> - Well, here we are.<br> - What are we doing here?<br> Liquor raid.<br> Here?!<br> Everybody knows where the booze is.<br> The problem isn't finding it.<br> The problem is who wants<br> to cross Capone. Let's go.<br> You'd better be damn sure, Malone.<br> If you walk through this door,<br> you're walking into a world of trouble.<br> There's no turning back.<br> Do you understand?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Good. Give me that axe.<br> - Federal officers!<br> - Get your hands in the air!<br> - Nobody moves!<br> - This is a raid!<br> - Everybody...<br> - What are you doin' here?<br> All this stuff is impounded!<br> You're all under arrest!<br> Hey! This isn't right!<br> Hey! This is no good!<br> - You got a warrant?<br> - Sure! Here's my warrant.<br> How do you think he feels now?<br> Better... or worse?<br> - What is that?<br> - What is that?<br> - Yes, what is it?<br> - God, I'm with a heathen.<br> That is my callbox key.<br> And that is Saint Jude.<br> Il Santo Jude.<br> He's the patron saint of lost causes.<br> And policemen.<br> - Patron saint of policemen?<br> - Everybody needs a friend.<br> Lost causes, policemen...<br> - Which do you want to be?<br> - I want to be a cop.<br> - You do?<br> - Yes.<br> Why?<br> 'To protect the property<br> and the citizenry...
