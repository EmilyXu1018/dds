                        How you doin', Keaton?<br> I can't feel my legs,<br> Keyser.<br> Ready?<br> What time is it?<br> It all started back<br> in New York six weeks ago.<br> A truck loaded with stripped gun parts<br> got jacked outside of Queens.<br> The driver saw nobody, but<br> somebody fucked up. He heard a voice.<br> Sometimes that's all you need.<br> Mr McManus?<br> Christ, don't you fuckin' guys ever sleep?<br> - We have a warrant for your arrest.<br> - Fuck you, pig.<br> Todd Hockney?<br> - Who wants to know?<br> - New York Police Department.<br> Shit. Freeze!<br> Hold it!<br> Sure you brought enough guys?<br> It's quite simple.<br> A restaurant that changes with the taste<br> without losing the overall aesthetic.<br> In other words, the atmosphere<br> will not be painted on the walls.<br> - Where will it be?<br> - Let me give you an example.<br> This I had to see for myself.<br> David.<br> - I'm in a meeting.<br> - Time for another one.<br> Everyone, this is David Kujan.<br> Special Agent Kujan, US Customs.<br> These gentlemen are from<br> the New York Police Department.<br> You look good, Keaton.<br> Better than I would have thought.<br> Il y a un problme?<br> A small matter of a stolen truck<br> loaded with guns.<br> - Mr Keaton?<br> - Will you excuse us for a moment?<br> We have some questions<br> to ask you downtown.<br> - Peut-tre nous vous laisserions...<br> - No, no, no, please. Please sit down.<br> This is a small problem.<br> - Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.<br> - OK.<br> - Qu'est-ce qui s'est pass I?<br> - Non, c'est pas du tout un problme.<br> - C'est la police, n'est-ce pas?<br> - a a I'air.<br> a va.<br> Unique.<br> Oui!<br> It didn't make sense that I'd be there.<br> I mean, these guys<br> were hard-core hijackers.<br> But there I was.<br> At that point I wasn't scared.<br> I knew I hadn't done anything<br> they could do me for.<br> Besides, it was fun.<br> I got to make like I was notorious.<br> You know the drill.<br> When your number is called, step forward<br> and repeat the phrase you've been given.<br> Number one, step forward.<br> Hand me the keys,<br> you fucking cocksucker.<br> Number two, step forward.<br> Give me the fucking keys,<br> you fucking cocksucker, motherfucker...<br> Knock it off! Get back!<br> Number three, step forward.<br> - Hand me the keys.<br> - In English, please.<br> - Excuse me?<br> - In English!<br> Hand me the fucking keys,<br> you cocksucker. What the fuck?<br> Number four, step forward.<br> It was bullshit.<br> The whole rap was a setup.<br> Hand me the keys,<br> you fucking cocksucker.<br> It was all the cops' fault. You don't<br> put guys like that into a room together.<br> Who knows what can happen?<br> Hand me the keys,<br> you fucking cocksucker.<br> This has really gotta be<br> embarrassing for you guys.<br> They drilled us all night. Somebody was<br> pissed about that truck getting hijacked.<br> They were hoping somebody<br> would give them something to go on.<br> They knew we wouldn't fight it<br> because they knew how to lean on us.<br> Our rights went out the window.<br> It was a violation. Disgraceful.<br> They went after McManus first -<br> a top-notch entry man.<br> - What truck?<br> - The truck with the guns, fucko.<br> Fucko?<br> He was a good guy. Crazy though.<br> Wanna know what Fenster told us?<br> - Say who?<br> - McManus! He told us another story.<br> Oh, is that the one about<br> the hooker with dysentery?<br> Fenster always worked with McManus.<br> He was a tight-ass,<br> but when it came to the job<br> he was right-on - a smart man.<br> - What are you saying?<br> - I said he'll flip you.<br> - He'll what?<br> - Flip you. Flip you for real.<br> - Yeah, I'm shakin'. Come on.<br> - OK.<br> - Answer my question.<br> - Can you hear me in the back?<br> Hello?<br> I want my lawyer. I'm gonna have<br> your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.<br> Todd Hockney. Good with explosives.<br> Without a doubt, the one guy<br> who didn't give a fuck about anybody.<br> You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.<br> You think so? I could put you in Queens<br> on the night of the hijacking.<br> Really?<br> I live in Queens. Did you put<br> that together yourself, Einstein?<br> Got a team of monkeys workin' on this?<br> You know what happens<br> if you do another turn in the joint?<br> Fuck your father in the shower, then<br> have a snack. You gonna charge me?<br> When I'm ready.<br> - With what?<br> - You know damn well, dead man.<br> But Keaton was the real prize for them,<br> for obvious reasons.<br> It was your mistake, not mine.<br> Did you ever stop to ask me?<br> I mean, I've been walking around<br> with the same face, the same name.<br> - I'm a business man.<br> - What's that, the restaurant business?<br> From now on you're in<br> the getting-fucked-by-us business.<br> I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.<br> Like I said, it was your mistake. Not mine.<br> Now, you charge me<br> with this shit and I'll beat it.<br> OK?<br> Let's get back to the truck, asshole.<br> I really, really think somebody<br> should do something about this shit.<br> So I did a little time. Does that mean I get<br> railed every time a truck finds its way...<br> Fuck 'em!<br> Fenster, will you relax? These guys<br> don't have any probable cause.<br> You're fucking-A right.<br> No PC. No goddamn right.<br> You do some time, never let you go.<br> They treat me like a criminal.<br> - I'll end up a criminal.<br> - You are a criminal!<br> Now, what you gotta go and do that?<br> - I'm tryin' to make a point.<br> - Why don't you make your point?<br> You're makin' me tired all over.<br> Well, fuck it then.<br> - I heard you were dead.<br> - Oh, yeah? Well, you heard right.<br> Word I got is you hung up your<br> spurs, man. What's that all about?<br> What's this?<br> Rumour has it Keaton's gone straight.<br> - I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.<br> - Who's that?<br> A heavyweight criminal lawyer from<br> uptown. I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.<br> How about it, Keaton?<br> You a lawyer's wife?<br> What kind of retainer are you givin' her?<br> Hey, Fenster, do your friend a favour.<br> Tell him to keep quiet.<br> Dean Keaton.<br> Gone clean, huh?<br> Say it ain't so.<br> Or was it you that hit that truck?<br> Mac, Mac, forget him.<br> Did you get to talk to your lawyer?<br> - This whole thing was a shakedown.<br> - What makes you say that?<br> How many times you been in a line-up?<br> It's always you and four dummies. PD pay<br> homeless guys $10 a head half the time.<br> And there's no way<br> they'd line five felons in the same row.<br> And a voice line-up? A public<br> defender can get you outta that one.<br> - So why the hell was I strip-searched?<br> - That was the feds.<br> Truckload of guns get snagged. Customs<br> comes down on NYPD wanting answers.<br> They come up with us.<br> They're clutching at straws.<br> - I had a guy's finger up my asshole.<br> - Is it Friday already?<br> Yeah, lover boy. You want a piece?<br> So who in the goddamn piss hell<br> stole our fucking truck?<br> - What did you say?<br> - Who stole the fucking truck?<br> - I don't want to know.<br> - Who asked you, working man?<br> Fuck who did it!<br> I wanna know who's the gimp.<br> - He's OK.<br> - How do I know that?<br> - What about it? What's your story?<br> - His name is Verbal.<br> - Verbal Kint.<br> - Verbal?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Roger really. People say I talk too much.<br> - I was just gonna tell you to shut up.<br> - We met before once or twice.<br> - In county. I was in for fraud.<br> - A line-up then, too. What happened?<br> I walked. 90 days, suspended.<br> - So you did it!<br> - All right, now, look.<br> We've all been put out<br> by this whole thing, right?<br> So I figure we owe it to ourselves<br> to salvage a little dignity.<br> Now, me and Fenster<br> heard about a little job.<br> - Why don't you just calm down?<br> - What do you care what he has to say?<br> I'm just talkin' here.<br> It seems like Mr Hockney wants to hear<br> what I got to say. I know Fenster's down.<br> What about you, guy?<br> I'm interested. Sure.<br> There, see? So now I'd like<br> to exercise my right to free assembly.<br> Why don't you just shut up?<br> You're missing the point.<br> No.<br> You're missing the point.<br> I don't wanna hear anything from you.<br> I don't care about your job.<br> And...<br> I want nothing to do with any of you.<br> I beg your pardon,<br> but you can all go to hell.<br> Dean Keaton, gone the high road.<br> What is the world coming to?<br> Fuck him.<br> That was how it started. Five men<br> brought in on a trumped-up charge<br> to be leaned on by halfwits.<br> OK. Now I really can't<br> talk about it much here...<br> What the cops never figured out,<br> and what I know now,<br> was that these men would<br> never break, never lie down,<br> never bend over for anybody.<br> Anybody.<br> SAN PEDRO<br> - Who are you?<br> - Agent Jack Baer, FBI. How many dead?<br> bodies out of the water though.<br> - Any survivors?<br> - Yeah, two.<br> One guy's in county hospital,<br> but he's in a coma.<br> The DA has a second guy,<br> a cripple from New York, I think.<br> The chief wants this place sealed off.<br> If you have any questions, give him a call.<br> This is Dave Kujan.<br> I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.<br> If you need to reach me, call Jeff Rabin<br> of the San Pedro PD on extension 112.<br> Have a nice day.<br> - Why can't I see him?<br> - Dave, I told you.<br> The DA came last night ready to arraign<br> even before they moved him to county.<br> Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later,<br> DA comes out the office looking like<br> he'd been smacked around.<br> They take his statement<br> and they cut him a deal.<br> - Did they charge him with anything?<br> - Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanour two.<br> What is that?<br> Listen, I give the DA credit<br> for getting that much. Understand?<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> This whole thing has turned political.<br> The mayor was here last night. The chief.<br> This morning the governor called, OK?<br> I'm telling you this guy is protected from<br> up on high by the Prince of Darkness.<br> - Take my word for it.<br> - When does he post bail?<br> - Two hours, tops.<br> - I wanna see him.<br> - No, Dave.<br> - I gotta see him.<br> - Dave, no! I cannot do this for you.<br> - You gotta. I came a long way for this.<br> Dave, please.<br> Even if I let you talk to him,<br> he won't talk to you.<br> He's paranoid. He knows the<br> interrogation rooms are all wired.<br> I quit. This won't be an interrogation.<br> Just a friendly chat.<br> - He will not go in the interrogation room.<br> - Someplace else.<br> Where?<br> No, no, no, no, no...<br> If it was a dope deal, where's the dope?<br> If it was a hit, who called it in?<br> - I'm sure you have a host of wild theories.<br> - They know damn well what I think.<br> That's crazy! Besides, the guy's got<br> total immunity. His story checks out.<br> - He doesn't know what you wanna know.<br> - I don't think he does. Not exactly.<br> But there's more to his story.<br> Jeffrey, look, I wanna know why<br> for what looks to be $91 million<br> worth of dope that wasn't there.<br> And, above all, I wanna<br> be sure Dean Keaton's dead.<br> - He's dead.<br> - Come on. Two hours.<br> Just till he makes bail.<br> They're all dead. I don't care how<br> tough a guy you say Keaton was,<br> nobody on that boat<br> could have come out alive.<br> - Is he talking?<br> - He just regained consciousness.<br> - He spoke... not English, then he lapsed.<br> - Hungarian.<br> - Might have been.<br> - Most were Hungarians.<br> - You gotta put on one of these.<br> - Burn victims are susceptible to infection.<br> And, of course, there's no smoking.<br> Keep your mask up.<br> Please don't touch him.<br> - Is he gonna die?<br> - He has burns over 60% of his body.<br> - A number of ribs are broken.<br> - Call Security. Put a man on the door.<br> - Is he dangerous?<br> - Yes.<br> Do it.<br> Do it now!<br> Joel? Yeah, Baer down at LA County.<br> Look, the guy they pulled out<br> of the harbour is Arkosh Kovash.<br> Yes. Yes. I'm sure.<br> No, he's all fucked up.<br> What? What? I can't hear you.<br> Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.<br> Yes?<br> Well, not until I put a man on him. Send<br> me someone who can speak Hungarian.<br> - Yeah, he's talking like a Thai hooker.<br> - Keyser Sze!<br> - What?<br> - Keyser Sze! Keyser Sze!<br> - Keyser Sze.<br> - No shit.<br> Joel. Yeah, call Dan Metzheiser at Justice<br> and find Dave Kujan from Customs.<br> Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> He wants to ask you a few questions.<br> - What about?<br> - About a Dean Keaton mostly.<br> But I'd like to start at<br> the line-up in New York.<br> - Can I get coffee?<br> - In a while. Let's talk about the line-up.<br> I'm really thirsty.<br> I used to dehydrate as a kid.<br> One time I got so bad, my piss<br> come out like snot. It was thick...<br> - I'll get your fucking coffee.<br> - Get me one too while you're at it.<br> That guy is tense. Tension is a killer.<br> I was in a barbershop quartet<br> in Skokie, Illinois.<br> The baritone was a guy named Kip Diskin.<br> Big, fat guy. I mean, like, orca fat.<br> - He was so stressed in the morning...<br> - Verbal, we're trying to help you.<br> Sure. And I appreciate that.<br> And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.<br> I like cops. I would have liked<br> to have been a fed myself, but...<br> Verbal, you're not telling us everything.<br> I know you know something.<br> I told the DA everything I know.<br> Verbal, I know you like Keaton.<br> I know you think he's a good man.<br> - I know he was good.<br> - He was a corrupt cop.<br> Sure, 15 years ago,<br> but he was a good thief.<br> - Anyway, cops wouldn't let him go legit.<br> - Dean Keaton was a piece of shit!<br> Are you trying to get<br> a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?<br> - I just wanna hear your story.<br> - It's all there.<br> May I have a cigarette?<br> - According to your statement...<br> - I need a light.<br> According to your statement, you're<br> a short-con operator. Run-of-the-mill...<br> According to your statement,<br> you're a short-con operator.<br> - Run-of-the-mill scams.<br> - It's been suppressed. It's inadmissible.<br> Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have here.<br> Total immunity.<br> Well, I do have the weapons charge. I'm<br> looking at six whole months' hard time.<br> You know a dealer<br> named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?<br> Know a religious guy named John Paul?<br> - You know Ruby's in Attica?<br> - He didn't have my lawyer.<br> I know Ruby. He's big on respect. He's a<br> good friend of mine, likes me very much.<br> I know your testimony is sealed. Ruby has<br> a lot of friends inside do favours for him.<br> What do you think he'd say if he found out<br> you dropped his name to the DA?<br> - There's nothing in there about Ruby.<br> - I'll mention that to him.<br> First thing on the job<br> I learnt how to spot a murderer.<br> Say you arrest three guys<br> for the same killing and put 'em in jail.<br> Next day whoever's sleeping is your man.<br> If you're guilty, you know you're caught,<br> you get some rest. You follow me?<br> - No.<br> - Let me get right to the point.<br> I'm smarter than you and<br> I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.<br> And I'm gonna get it from you<br> whether you like it or not.<br> I'm not a rat.<br> Thanks.<br> When I was picking beans in Guatemala,<br> we'd make fresh coffee right off the trees.<br> That was good. This is shit,<br> but, hey, I'm in a police station...<br> - Can we get started again?<br> - Now, what happened after the line-up?<br> The desk sergeant told me he couldn't<br> release you. Can you believe that?<br> You weren't even charged!<br> New York police.<br> I want pictures taken of your face.<br> I'll take 'em to the DA first thing.<br> - Forget about it.<br> - No! I'll have this in front of a grand jury!<br> Look, I don't wanna<br> talk about it, Edie. OK?<br> So what did Fortier and Renault say?<br> - They need more time to think about it.<br> - Dammit! More time for what, Edie?<br> No matter how you cover my tracks,<br> they'll still find out about me.<br> Give me some credit. I got you this far.<br> - Let's go to the grand jury. It won't stop!<br> - Look, it's never gonna stop, period!<br> By next week every investor in the city's<br> gonna be walkin' away from us.<br> It's finished.<br> I'm finished.<br> Don't give up on me now, Dean.<br> It's never gonna stop.<br> I love you.<br> They ruined me in there tonight.<br> I love you.<br> Do you hear me?<br> What?<br> All right.<br> Let's just go to my place.<br> We'll worry about this tomorrow.<br> Let's go.<br> Fenster and McManus<br> had a cagey proposition.<br> A fast jump, high risk, long money.<br> We all knew it could be done.<br> The way I figured,<br> to do it wrong meant killing.<br> To do it right took five men.<br> Five men meant Keaton.<br> Keaton took convincing.<br> New York's Finest Taxi Service.<br> Bullshit.<br> Bullshit.<br> They don't operate any more.<br> McManus has a friend in the 14th<br> Precinct. They're coming out for one job.<br> They're picking up a guy smuggling<br> emeralds. McManus already has a fence.<br> - A fence? Who?<br> - Some guy in California named Redfoot.<br> - I never heard of him.<br> - You have to come.<br> - What's it to you whether I do it or not?<br> - They don't know me. You do.<br> They won't take me unless you go.<br> Look at me. I need this.<br> Oh, you're telling me you don't<br> need this? Is this your place?<br> I'm not knocking you. You got a good<br> scam going with this lawyer...<br> Sorry.<br> It's OK. It's OK.<br> You say it's the real thing, that's cool.<br> - You OK?<br> - I was outta line.<br> But they're never gonna<br> stop with us. You know that.<br> As clean as you could get,<br> they'll never let you go.<br> This way we hit the cops where it hurts<br> and we get well in the meantime.<br> - You sure you're OK?<br> - I'll be all right.<br> Look, I...<br> - I sometimes get...<br> - Forget it.<br> I'll probably shit blood tonight.<br> So...<br> how do they wanna do it?<br> McManus wants to go in shooting.<br> I say no.<br> Fenster? Hockney?<br> They're pretty pissed off.<br> They'll do anything.<br> I got a way to do it without killing anyone,<br> but they won't let me in without you.<br> Three million?<br> Maybe more.<br> No killing?<br> Not if we do it my way.<br> New York's Finest Taxi Service<br> was not your normal service.<br> It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD<br> that ran a high-profit racket<br> driving smugglers and<br> drug dealers round the city.<br> For a few hundred dollars a mile<br> you got your own police escort.<br> They even had business cards.<br> After a while somebody started asking<br> questions and the service shut down.<br> Since then Internal Affairs have<br> been waiting to catch them in the act.<br> That's where we came in.<br> - So, how was the flight?<br> - Fucking great.<br> Will this get me to Staten Island?<br> You kidding me?<br> This'll get you to Cape Cod.<br> McManus brought us the job. Fenster got<br> the vans, Hockney supplied the hardware.<br> I came up with how to do it<br> so no one got killed.<br> But Keaton? Keaton<br> put on the finishing touch.<br> A little "fuck you"<br> from the five of us to the NYPD.<br> All right, watch this, watch this.<br> Careful, careful!<br> Come on, asshole! Fuck!<br> Holy shit!<br> - Don't move, you fuckers!<br> - Drop it now, motherfucker.<br> - Hurry up!<br> - Drop it! Don't fuckin' move!<br> - What do you want?<br> - Put the fuckin' thing away.<br> - Stupid asshole.<br> - Don't fuckin' move, mama!<br> You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?<br> Fuck!<br> - Afternoon, pork chops. Give me the shit.<br> - Give him the fuckin' shit!<br> Give him the fuckin' thing!<br> Give him the fuckin' shit, man!<br> Hurry up!<br> - Come on!<br> - Now the money.<br> - There's no money.<br> - Give me the money!<br> - There's no fuckin' money!<br> - Give me it!<br> - Give me the fuckin' money!<br> - Give him the money!<br> - Give me the money!<br> - Give him the money!<br> Hurry up!<br> Motherfucker! You know who the fuck I<br> am? You people know who the fuck I am?<br> - Fuck!<br> - We do now, jerk-off.<br> Wait a minute. What's that?<br> What the fuck...? Holy shit!<br> Go! Go! Go!<br> Keaton made an anonymous phone call.<br> The press arrived before the police did.<br> Strausz and Rizzi<br> were indicted three days later.<br> Within a few weeks<br> Everybody got it right in the ass<br> from the chief on down.<br> It was beautiful.<br> I owe you $2.50.<br> Dr Keaton.<br> - There's more here than I thought.<br> - When's the fence coming?<br> Redfoot never comes to see me.<br> I always go to see him.<br> In California?<br> Yes, Verbal. In California.<br> - Fenster and I...<br> - Wait. Hold the fuckin' phone.<br> You and Fenster? No, no, no, no, no.<br> You fuckin' kiddin' me?<br> OK, so everyone's gonna go.<br> We all go.<br> What's your fuckin' problem, man?<br> My fuckin' problem is that<br> you and Fenster are off in California<br> - while we're sittin' here holdin' our dicks!<br> - Hey! The job's over.<br> Cool it.<br> LA's a good place to lie low for a while.<br> You wanna dance?<br> Ladies...<br> I would like to propose a toast.<br> There you go.<br> To Mr Verbal.<br> The man with the plan.<br> We're gonna miss the flight.<br> Don't do this. Send her a note, something.<br> I said we'll make it.<br> We're gonna miss the plane.<br> She'll understand.<br> That's heart-warming. Really.<br> I'm weepy.<br> Jeff, you wanna wait outside?<br> You guys wanted to know<br> what happened after the line-up.<br> Come on, Verbal.<br> Who do you think you're talkin' to?<br> You expect me to believe that he retired?<br> For a woman?<br> Bullshit. Keaton was using her.<br> - He loved her.<br> - Sure.<br> I'm supposed to believe<br> hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea?<br> - That was all Fenster and McManus.<br> - Keaton was a cop for four years.<br> - Who'd know the service better?<br> - But Edie had him turned around.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> I know Dean Keaton.<br> I've been investigating him<br> for the past three years.<br> The guy I know was<br> a cold-blooded bastard.<br> IAD indicted him on three murder counts<br> before he was kicked off the force.<br> - So don't sell me the hooker with a heart.<br> - You got him all wrong.<br> Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total<br> of seven times while he was on the force.<br> In every case the witnesses<br> either reversed their testimony,<br> or died before they could testify.<br> When they finally did nail him for fraud,<br> he spent five years in Sing Sing.<br> He killed three prisoners inside.<br> Of course, I can't prove this.<br> But I can't prove the best part either.<br> Dean Keaton was dead.<br> Did you know that? He died in a fire<br> two years ago during an investigation<br> into the murder of a witness<br> who was going to testify against him.<br> Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into<br> a warehouse he owned before it blew up.<br> They said he went in<br> to check a leaking gas main.<br> It blew up and took<br> all of Dean Keaton with it.<br> Within three months of the explosion,<br> the two witnesses, they were dead.<br> One killed himself in his car,<br> the other fell down<br> an open elevator shaft.<br> - Get this show on the road.<br> - There are too many people here.<br> Doctor, we'll be out of here<br> before he blows his porch light.<br> - I have a noon meeting.<br> - Five minutes.<br> Everyone, calm down, all right?<br> I want you to ask this man<br> about the shoot-out in the harbour.<br> - He says they were buying...<br> - Dope. We know.<br> He doesn't know what they were buying,<br> but not dope. People.<br> What?<br> - He needs guarantees.<br> - What is he talking about?<br> He says his life's in danger.<br> He saw the devil, looked him in the eye.<br> - I'm on my way.<br> - No, no, no. Wait a minute.<br> Ask him to tell him what he told me...<br> about the devil.<br> Who's the devil?<br> Keyser Sze.<br> - Keyser Sze?<br> - He was in the harbour killing many men.<br> He saw Keyser Sze?<br> - He saw his face.<br> - Tell him to tell her what he looks like.<br> - Describe him.<br> - OK.<br> Six weeks ago<br> an anonymous call tells me<br> I can find Keaton at Mondino's<br> with his attorney. And there he is.<br> Because he never profited<br> from his alleged death<br> and we convicted someone else<br> of the murder we tried to pin on him,<br> we had to let him go.<br> He was dead just long enough<br> for the murder rap to blow over,<br> and then he had lunch.<br> - I don't know about that.<br> - I don't think you do.<br> But you say you saw Keaton die. You're<br> covering his ass and he's still out there.<br> I think he's behind that whole circus at the<br> harbour. He's using you cos you're stupid.<br> You tell me he's dead, so be it. I wanna be<br> sure he is before I go back to New York.<br> He wasn't behind anything.<br> It was the lawyer.<br> What lawyer?<br> - What lawyer, Verbal?<br> - When I was in that barbershop quartet...<br> I know you held out on the DA!<br> What did you leave out of that testimony?<br> - I can call up Ruby in ten minutes!<br> - The DA gave me immunity.<br> Not from me. You get no immunity<br> from me, you piece of shit.<br> Every criminal I've put in prison,<br> every cop that owes me a favour,<br> every creep that walks the street for<br> a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.<br> Now you talk to me, or that immunity<br> they seem so fit to grant you<br> won't be worth the paper the contract<br> put out on your life is printed on.<br> There was a lawyer.<br> Kobayashi.<br> - Is he the one that killed Keaton?<br> - No. But I'm sure Keaton is dead.<br> Convince me.<br> And tell me every last detail.<br> We arrived in Los Angeles<br> and met McManus's fence, Redfoot.<br> He had a good reputation.<br> Seemed like a good guy.<br> Still, we should've known better.<br> - How you doin'?<br> - Good. You?<br> Not bad. Can't complain.<br> How's it goin', Fenster?<br> Don't need to open it, right?<br> You must be Keaton.<br> Redfoot, Dean Keaton,<br> Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.<br> Verbal. The man with the plan.<br> - Interested in any more work?<br> - We're always lookin' for extra work.<br> - We're on vacation.<br> - Well, that's too bad.<br> I got a ton of work and I don't have<br> any good people like you guys.<br> - What's the job?<br> - A jeweller out of Texas named Saul.<br> He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.<br> He does free appraisals for people.<br> Anyway, the word is<br> he carries around a lot of cash.<br> So I figure I keep the merchandise,<br> you keep the green. Simple.<br> - What about security?<br> - Bodyguards. Nothing you can't handle.<br> - Give me time to check it out?<br> - I'd expect nothing less from you, man.<br> Good to see you. We'll call you.<br> Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.<br> Hey...<br> A friend of mine in New York tells me that<br> you know, that you knew Spook Hollis.<br> The way I hear it,<br> you did time with old Spook.<br> Good man, wasn't he?<br> I used to run dope for him.<br> - Too bad he got shieved.<br> - Yeah.<br> I shieved him.<br> Better you hear it from me now<br> than from somebody else later.<br> I appreciate that.<br> Just out of curiosity,<br> was it business or personal?<br> A bit of both.<br> Well, like I said, you give me a call<br> if you're interested, all right?<br> Is there a problem?<br> One job. That was the deal.<br> One job?<br> One job!<br> That's a good one, Keaton.<br> Keaton fought it as best he could,<br> but a man can't change what he is.<br> He can convince anyone<br> he's someone else, but never himself.<br> It took one day with McManus<br> nagging him, and we went back to work.<br> So, I get out of my car.<br> I think it's wrecked.<br> In the back seat of the other car,<br> this woman's totally naked!<br> - I'm laughin' so hard, I can't breathe.<br> - Get in the car, Saul.<br> Freeze! Freeze!<br> There's a second one here somewhere.<br> Give me the case.<br> Give me the fuckin' case!<br> Give me the case.<br> I'm telling you for the last time,<br> give me the fuckin' case!<br> - Come on!<br> - Hey! Don't move.<br> Look, just hand over the case.<br> Hand over the fuckin' case!<br> Come on. Let's go!<br> - Come on!<br> - Bad day. Fuck it.<br> Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!<br> Fuck!<br> Looks like a lot of china to me. Shit.<br> Guys, come on.<br> - What're you doin'?<br> - I'm gonna kill him.<br> - We did it your way, now my way.<br> - You gonna kill him?<br> - I'm gonna deal with it.<br> - You better.<br> I'm gonna deal with it. Shut up!<br> What am I supposed to do with that?<br> Feed it to the gimp, ease his pain.<br> I don't know what it is.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I don't know. I got this job from a lawyer.<br> - Yeah, who?<br> - I don't know. Some limey.<br> He's a middle man for somebody, OK?<br> He doesn't say, I don't ask.<br> - You're fuckin' full of shit!<br> - Fuck you!<br> - Fuck you!<br> - Listen to me! We wanna meet him, OK?<br> That's funny.<br> He called me last night.<br> He says he wants to meet you guys.<br> - OK. We'll meet him.<br> - I'll call you.<br> - Good. Do that. No problem.<br> - I don't like it, Dean. Wait.<br> One more thing, tough guy. Any more<br> surprises and I'm gonna kill you.<br> Such a tough guy, McManus.<br> Do me a favour, get the fuck off my dick.<br> - Fuck!<br> - No! No!<br> Better put a leash on that puppy.<br> You know, it's an awful shame<br> about Saul gettin' whacked.<br> The cops are gonna be<br> lookin' for the guys who did it.<br> Sooner or later they're gonna<br> come around askin' me.<br> You have a sweet night, ladies.<br> Fuck you.<br> - So this lawyer...<br> - Kobayashi.<br> - Came from Redfoot.<br> - Right.<br> Why leave this out<br> when you talked to the DA?<br> Dave, someone to see you.<br> Jack!<br> Been lookin' for you. Still after that coke<br> from the harbour blood bath yesterday?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Stop lookin'. There was no coke.<br> I been in LA County talkin' to a guy they<br> pulled out of a drainpipe in San Pedro.<br> He came to this morning.<br> He's in a Hungarian mob doing a deal with<br> Argentinians. Says it was no dope deal.<br> - But the $91 million...<br> - We know. He says no way on the dope.<br> He tells me they were pulling<br> stumps for Turkey the next day.<br> They had no time to negotiate that kind<br> of product and no means to move it.<br> - What's the money for?<br> - He didn't know. No one knew.<br> Except for a few key people.<br> They were all very hush about it, he says.<br> - Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.<br> - I don't get it.<br> They tell me you got the cripple from<br> New York. Did he mention Keyser Sze?<br> Who?<br> Just bear with me here.<br> - Who's Keyser Sze?<br> - Fuck!<br> We've been going over this<br> for an hour and a half.<br> What we need to do is find Redfoot,<br> Keaton, and get the hell outta here.<br> What we need to do is think. Think back.<br> Somebody with power.<br> Somebody capable of<br> trackin' us from New York to LA.<br> - Dean, what the hell are we doin' here?<br> - We're waitin'!<br> - I'm out.<br> - Sit down.<br> No. It's hot and I'm fuckin' bored.<br> Mr Hockney, do stay.<br> Mr Keaton.<br> Mr Fenster I recognise from<br> his mug shots, as well as Mr McManus.<br> I can only assume that you are Mr Kint,<br> the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.<br> My employer sends his gratitude.<br> A most unexpected benefit.<br> I am Mr Kobayashi.<br> I have been asked by my employer<br> to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.<br> - What do you want?<br> - My employer requires your services.<br> One job. One day's work. Very dangerous.<br> He does not expect all of you to live,<br> but those of you who do<br> will have $91 million to divide<br> between you in any way you see fit.<br> Who's your boss?<br> I work for Keyser Sze.<br> - Who's Keyser Sze?<br> - Judging by the change in mood, Mr Kint,<br> I feel sure the rest of<br> your associates can tell you.<br> I come with an offer<br> directly from Mr Sze.<br> - An order, actually.<br> - What do you mean "an order"?<br> In 1981, Mr Keaton, you participated in a<br> hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York.<br> The cargo was raw steel.<br> Steel which belonged to Mr Sze<br> and which was destined for Pakistan<br> to be used in a nuclear reactor.<br> A most profitable violation<br> of UN regulations.<br> You had no way of knowing this<br> because the fellow shipping the steel<br> was working for Mr Sze<br> without his knowledge.<br> Earlier this year Mr Fenster and Mr<br> McManus hijacked a flight out of Newark.<br> The plane was carrying gold and<br> platinum wiring, also set for Pakistan.<br> Two months ago Mr Hockney stole a<br> truck carrying gun parts through Queens.<br> Gun parts which were set to be<br> destroyed by the State of New York.<br> They were to be lost in a way station<br> and rerouted to Belfast.<br> Again Mr Sze,<br> using pawns who had no knowledge.<br> Which brings us to Mr Kint.<br> Nine months ago one of<br> Mr Sze's less than intelligent couriers<br> was taken in a complicated<br> confidence scam by a cripple.<br> He was relieved of $62,000.<br> Now, it has taken us<br> some time to find you.<br> Our intention was to approach you<br> after your apprehension in New York.<br> - You set up the line-up?<br> - Yes.<br> You were not to be released until I arrived.<br> It seems Ms Finneran was a little<br> too effective in expediting his release.<br> Holding the rest of you was a moot point.<br> - What about Redfoot?<br> - Mr Redfoot knew nothing.<br> Mr Sze rarely works<br> with the same people for long,<br> and they never know<br> who they're working for.<br> One cannot be betrayed,<br> if one has no people.<br> So, why are you telling us?<br> Because you have stolen from<br> Mr Sze, Mr Fenster. All of you.<br> That you did not know you stole from him<br> is the only reason you are still alive.<br> He feels you owe him.<br> You will repay your debt.<br> All right, fuck the debt and fuck you.<br> How do we know you work for Sze?<br> I don't think that is relevant, Mr Hockney.<br> All five of you are responsible for the<br> murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.<br> Mr Redfoot can testify to your<br> involvement and we can see to it he will.<br> - What's your point?<br> - The offer is this, gentlemen.<br> Mr Sze's primary interest is narcotics.<br> He's been competing, shall we say, with<br> a group of Argentinians for years now.<br> Competing with Mr Sze has taken its toll.<br> The Argentinians are negotiating the sale<br> of $91 m in cocaine in three days' time.<br> This purchase will revitalise the<br> diminishing strength of their organisation.<br> Mr Sze would like you to stop the deal.<br> If you choose,<br> you may wait until after the buy.<br> Whatever money changes hands is yours.<br> Mr Sze would like you to get to the boat<br> and destroy the cocaine on board.<br> And then you will be free<br> of your obligations to Mr Sze.<br> You give me one good reason<br> why I shouldn't kill you right now.<br> A gift from Mr Sze.<br> Good day, gentlemen.<br> My whole life's in here -<br> everything I've done since I was 18.<br> They fuckin' know everything.<br> Everybody I've ever worked with<br> or did time with.<br> No.<br> - This isn't right.<br> - I don't know.<br> Who was that guy who used<br> to talk about Sze in New York?<br> - Bricks Marlin.<br> - Yeah, I did jobs for him. Indirect stuff.<br> He said he always made five times<br> more money than the job was worth.<br> This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's<br> usin' him for window-dressing.<br> - I don't know. This is bad.<br> - No, it's bullshit.<br> This guy could be LAPD.<br> It's a fuckin' set-up.<br> The way I hear it,<br> Sze is some kind of butcher.<br> - A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.<br> - There is no Keyser Sze!<br> Who is Keyser Sze?<br> He's supposed to be Turkish.<br> Some say his father was German.<br> Nobody ever believed he was real.<br> Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody<br> that worked directly for him,<br> but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody<br> could've worked for him. You never knew.<br> That was his power.<br> The greatest trick the devil ever pulled<br> was convincing the world he didn't exist.<br> One story the guys told me - the story<br> I believe - was from his days in Turkey.<br> A gang of Hungarians<br> wanted their own mob.<br> They realised that to be in power you<br> didn't need guns or money or numbers.<br> You just needed the will<br> to do what the other guy wouldn't.<br> After a while they come into power,<br> and they come after Sze.<br> He was small-time then,<br> just running dope, they say.<br> They come to his home in the afternoon<br> looking for his business.<br> They find his wife and kids in the house<br> and decide to wait for Sze.<br> He comes home to find his wife raped<br> and children screaming.<br> The Hungarians knew Sze was tough, so<br> they let him know they meant business.<br> They tell him they want<br> his territory, all his business.<br> Sze looks over the faces of his family,<br> then he showed these men of will<br> what will really was.<br> He tells him he would<br> rather see his family dead<br> than live another day after this.<br> He lets the last Hungarian go,<br> waits until his family are buried,<br> then goes after the rest of the mob.<br> He kills their kids, their wives,<br> their parents and their parents' friends.<br> He burns down the houses they live in<br> and the stores they work in.<br> He kills people that owe them money.<br> And like that... he's gone.<br> Underground.<br> Nobody's ever seen him since.<br> He becomes a myth, a spook story<br> that criminals tell their kids at night.<br> "Rat on your pop,<br> and Keyser Sze will get you. "<br> But no one ever really believes.<br> Do you believe in him, Verbal?<br> Keaton always said<br> "I don't believe in God,<br> but I'm afraid of him. "<br> Well, I believe in God.<br> And the only thing that scares me<br> is Keyser Sze.<br> Do you give any weight to this?<br> I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser<br> from Justice. He has a file on Sze in DC.<br> Been a hobby of his. Guys equate him<br> to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.<br> - You've heard of him?<br> - On the street?<br> - Yeah.<br> - A few times.<br> Outside stuff.<br> Somebody working for a guy<br> who worked for a guy who got some<br> money from Keyser Sze, shit like that.<br> It could be an old badge, a hex sign,<br> to keep people from fucking with you.<br> - But you're here.<br> - Shit, yeah.<br> I got a guy trying to leave hospital on<br> a fried drumstick cos he's afraid of Sze.<br> Yeah, I'll run it up the flagpole.<br> I told it like it happened on the boat.<br> So what if I left out how I got there?<br> It's so full of holes, the DA would've<br> told me to blow amnesty out my ass.<br> - That's why you never told the DA?<br> - You tell me, Agent Kujan.<br> If I said the Loch Ness Monster<br> hired me, what would you say?<br> - Turn state's evidence, we'll hear it out.<br> - I got immunity. What can you offer me?<br> If there really is a Keyser Sze,<br> he's gonna come looking for you.<br> Where's your head? Where do you<br> think the pressure's coming from?<br> Keyser Sze, or whatever you<br> wanna call him, knows where I am.<br> He's got the front burner under your ass<br> to let me go, so he can scoop me up later.<br> Immunity was to deal with you.<br> I got a new problem when I post bail.<br> So why play into his hands?<br> We can protect you.<br> Gee, thanks, Dave.<br> Bang-up job so far - extortion, coercion.<br> Kiss my pucker.<br> The fuckers that rounded us up and sank<br> us are now bailing me out? Fuck you.<br> You think you can catch Keyser Sze?<br> You think a guy like that comes this close<br> to getting caught and sticks his head out?<br> If he comes up for anything,<br> it'll be to get rid of me.<br> After that, my guess is<br> you'll never hear from him again.<br> What happened next?<br> The next morning Fenster was gone.<br> He couldn't handle slumming for Sze.<br> He left us a note wishing us good luck<br> and took a chunk of the money.<br> - Then what?<br> - McManus was furious.<br> He was talking about tracking him down<br> and ripping his heart out, all sorts of shit.<br> - That night we got the call.<br> - What call?<br> Kobayashi told us<br> where we could find Fenster.<br> Let's get the fuck outta here.<br> - We gotta bury him.<br> - With what?<br> With our hands.<br> This is nuts.<br> It's dry fucking sand, McManus.<br> When he rots, the surfers<br> are gonna smell him a mile away.<br> - Dig, you fuck!<br> - What we gonna do? He's gonna kill us.<br> I don't know about you, peg leg,<br> but I can run. I got no problem with that.<br> Kobayashi doesn't seem<br> to have a problem with it either.<br> If you run, we're gonna be<br> diggin' a hole for you. You got that?<br> This ain't my boy we're buryin'.<br> I don't owe anybody!<br> - So fuck you.<br> - He was my partner for five years.<br> We did more jobs and I saw more money<br> than you can ever count, so fuck you!<br> - Cos now it's payback!<br> - It's not payback!<br> It's precaution. You want payback,<br> you wanna run, I don't care.<br> I'm not doin' this for Fenster.<br> I'm not doin' it for you.<br> I'm doin' this for me.<br> I'm gonna finish this thing.<br> This Kobayashi bastard<br> is not gonna stand on me.<br> - After they killed Fenster nobody'd run?<br> - I wanted to. I thought we could make it.<br> - Why didn't you say anything?<br> - I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.<br> It was too far-fetched for him.<br> Keaton was a grounded guy, an ex-cop.<br> To a cop, the explanation is never<br> that complicated. It's always simple.<br> There's no mystery,<br> no arch criminal behind it all.<br> If you got a dead body and<br> think his brother did it, you're right.<br> Nobody argued with Keaton. They just<br> set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.<br> They're coming up.<br> Did you hear me? He's coming up.<br> He's on his way down.<br> Don't move.<br> Press 20. Do it now.<br> Move!<br> - The answer is no.<br> - Mr Sze will be most upset...<br> Listen, cocksucker, there is no Keyser<br> Sze. You mention him again, I'll kill you.<br> A strange threat. I can only assume<br> you've come here to kill me anyway.<br> We know that you can get to us.<br> But now you know that we can get to you.<br> I'm giving you one<br> last chance to call this off.<br> Mr S... My employer has made up<br> his mind. He does not change it.<br> Neither do we.<br> You got Fenster, but you won't get all of<br> us before one of us gets through to you.<br> I believe you, Mr McManus.<br> I most sincerely do.<br> You would not have been chosen were<br> you not suitable, but it's not my decision.<br> Whatever you threaten<br> me with is ludicrous<br> in comparison to what will be done to me<br> if I do not carry out my orders in full.<br> I'm the guy that's gonna get you.<br> I just wanted you to know that.<br> I'm so sorry, Mr McManus.<br> I implore you, Mr Keaton, believe me,<br> Mr Sze is very real and very determined.<br> We'll see.<br> Before you do me in, Mr McManus,<br> you will let me finish my business<br> with Ms Finneran first, won't you?<br> What did you say?<br> Edie Finneran.<br> She's upstairs in my office<br> for an extradition deposition.<br> I requested she be put on the case<br> personally. She flew in yesterday.<br> No matter.<br> Kill away, Mr McManus.<br> - You're lyin'.<br> - Am I?<br> Ms Finneran's escort while she's here in<br> LA. Never leaves her side for a moment.<br> I thought you'd be glad<br> to know she's in good hands.<br> Now rest. The boat will<br> be ready for you on Friday.<br> If I see you or any of<br> your friends before then,<br> Ms Finneran will find herself the victim<br> of a gruesome violation before she dies.<br> As, indeed, will your father, Mr Hockney,<br> and your Uncle Randall<br> in Arizona, Mr Kint.<br> I might only castrate<br> Mr McManus's nephew David.<br> Do I make myself clear?<br> We'll take care of the bodies downstairs.<br> We'll add them to the cost of Mr Fenster.<br> If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.<br> It's a logistical nightmare.<br> Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.<br> - No tellin' how many more are below.<br> - Can we stealth these guys?<br> Nah. With all that coke,<br> they're gonna be ready.<br> Which brings me to<br> sunny point number two.<br> Even if one of us gets through and<br> jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.<br> - What if we wait for the money?<br> - Ten more men at least.<br> In my opinion it can't be done. Anybody<br> who goes in there is not comin' out alive.<br> - I'm gonna wait for the money.<br> - Me, too.<br> - Did you hear what he just said?<br> - If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.<br> Me, too.<br> There's nothing that can't be done.<br> I just can't believe<br> we're gonna walk into certain death.<br> The news said it's raining in New York.<br> - What language is that?<br> - I don't know.<br> Russian, I think.<br> Hungarian?<br> Package has arrived.<br> You kids ready?<br> I would be, if I didn't have<br> to stop and answer you.<br> I'm ready. McManus,<br> you better be set up in ten seconds.<br> I'm ready.<br> I want you to stay here.<br> - I'm supposed to cover the...<br> - Listen, if we fail, take the money and go.<br> - Keaton, I can't...<br> - Find Edie, tell her what happened.<br> She knows people, she knows what to do.<br> If I don't get Kobayashi my way,<br> she'll get him her way.<br> - What if I...<br> - Just do what I say. Please.<br> Tell her that...<br> Tell her I tried.<br> McManus, he's on his way.<br> I'm there.<br> One, two, three, four,<br> five, six, seven.<br> Oswald was a fag.<br> Hi.<br> How ya doin'?<br> Is there a problem?<br> Fernando...<br> - Qu hace aqu?<br> - Nada.<br> - Aqu no puede pasar.<br> - No se puede pasar por aqu?<br> Mejor que se regrese.<br> Now.<br> ? Old Macdonald had a farm<br> ? Ee-eye, ee-eye, oh<br> ? And on that farm he shot some guys<br> ? Bada-boom, bada-bing, bang, boom<br> Elvis has left the building.<br> No dispare. Vmonos!<br> Oh, man!<br> Hello.<br> - Why didn't you run?<br> - I froze up.<br> I thought about Fenster and<br> how he looked when we buried him.<br> Then I thought about Keaton.<br> It looked like he might pull it off.<br> Dave.<br> A boy came across a body on the beach<br> this morning. Shot twice in the head.<br> - Two men from the Bureau identified him.<br> - What else?<br> His name was Arturro Marquez,<br> a smuggler from Argentina.<br> He was arrested last year<br> in New York for trafficking.<br> He escapes to California.<br> They pick him up in Long Beach.<br> They're setting up extradition,<br> he escapes again.<br> Now, get this. Edie Finneran's brought in<br> to advise on the proceedings.<br> - Kobayashi.<br> - New York faxed a copy of his testimony.<br> - He was a rat.<br> - Yeah, a big fucking rat!<br> Arturro was very opposed<br> to returning to prison,<br> so much so that<br> he named close to 50 people.<br> Guess who he named in the finale?<br> - Keyser Sze.<br> - There's more.<br> I'll tell you what I know.<br> Stop me when this sounds familiar.<br> There was no dope on that boat.<br> - You, stay quiet.<br> - He's here. I know he's here.<br> That's him. I'm telling you,<br> that's him. I know he's here!<br> You can't understand. That's him.<br> - Shut up!<br> - That's him. You hear me?<br> I'm telling you it's Keyser Sze!<br> - Where's Hockney?<br> - I don't know. There's no coke!<br> - What?<br> - You heard me, you dumb fuck! No coke!<br> - What the fuck do you mean?!<br> - I've been in every fucking room!<br> - There's gotta be coke!<br> - There is nothing! Nothing!<br> Don't fuck with me.<br> There is no... fucking... coke!<br> I'm outta here.<br> I told them nothing.<br> I swear.<br> I told them nothing. Please.<br> McManus, what the fuck is goin' on?<br> The strangest thing.<br> Your statement says you saw a man<br> in a suit with a slim build.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Are you saying you saw Keyser Sze?<br> - You said you didn't know who it was.<br> - There was dope on that boat.<br> - Stop stallin'.<br> - I'm not!<br> - You know what I'm gettin' at!<br> - Hey! I got immunity. I won't take this!<br> You know what I'm gettin' at, Verbal!<br> - I don't know!<br> - Yes, you do! The truth!<br> Try to tell me<br> you saw someone kill Keaton.<br> - I did.<br> - You're lying to me!<br> - I am not!<br> - You've known this whole fuckin' time!<br> I don't know what you're saying.<br> I did see Keaton get shot, I swear.<br> Then why didn't you help him?<br> You had a gun. He was your friend!<br> Because I was afraid. OK?<br> - Afraid.<br> - Afraid of what?<br> - I knew it was Keyser Sze.<br> - But Keaton...<br> It was Keyser Sze, Agent Kujan.<br> I mean, the devil himself.<br> How do you shoot the devil in the back?<br> What if you miss?<br> All right. Let's get back to the pier.<br> - Arturro Marquez. Ever hear of him?<br> - What? No.<br> He was a stool pigeon<br> for the Justice Department.<br> He swore out a statement<br> saying that he had seen<br> and could positively identify<br> one Keyser Sze.<br> It says in the report: "He had<br> intimate knowledge of his businesses,<br> including but not exclusive<br> to drug-trafficking and murder. "<br> I never heard of him.<br> His people were selling him<br> to a gang of Hungarians.<br> Most likely the same Hungarians<br> Sze all but wiped out back in Turkey.<br> The money wasn't there for dope.<br> The Hungarians were gonna buy the one<br> guy that could incriminate Keyser Sze.<br> - I said I never heard of him.<br> - Keaton did.<br> Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition<br> adviser. She knew what he knew.<br> - I don't under...<br> - There were no drugs. It was a hit.<br> A suicide mission to whack out the<br> one guy that could finger Keyser Sze.<br> So Sze put some thieves to it, men he<br> knew he could march into certain death.<br> You're saying Sze<br> sent us to kill someone?<br> Keaton did. Verbal,<br> he left you behind for a reason.<br> Just do what I tell you.<br> If you all knew Sze'd find you anywhere,<br> why did he give you the money to run?<br> - He could have used you on the boat.<br> - He wanted me to live.<br> A one-time dirty cop<br> without a loyalty in the world<br> finds it in his heart<br> to save a worthless rat cripple.<br> No, sir. Why?<br> - Edie.<br> - I don't buy the reform story for a minute.<br> Even if I did, I certainly don't believe<br> he would send you to protect her.<br> So why?<br> Because he was my friend.<br> No, Verbal. He wasn't your friend.<br> - Keaton didn't have friends.<br> - What are you doin' here?<br> He saved you because<br> he wanted it that way. It was his will.<br> - Keaton was Keyser Sze.<br> - No.<br> The kind of man who could wrangle<br> men like Hockney and McManus.<br> The kind of man who could engineer<br> a line-up through all his contacts at NYPD.<br> The kind of man who<br> could've killed Edie Finneran!<br> She was found yesterday at a hotel<br> in Pennsylvania, shot twice in the head.<br> What do you think<br> about Keaton now, Verbal?<br> Edie?<br> He used all of you to get him on that boat.<br> He couldn't get on alone.<br> He had to pull the trigger himself<br> to make sure he got his man.<br> The one man that could identify him.<br> This is all bullshit.<br> You said you saw him die.<br> Or did you? You had to hide<br> when you heard the police cars.<br> You said you heard the shot<br> before the fire.<br> - But you didn't see him die.<br> - I knew him. He would never...<br> He programmed you to tell us<br> just what he wanted you to.<br> He knew we were close,<br> you said it yourself.<br> Where was the political pressure<br> coming from? It was Keaton.<br> Immunity was your reward.<br> But why me?<br> Why not Fenster, McManus or Hockney?<br> I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?<br> Because you're a cripple, Verbal.<br> Because you're stupid.<br> Because you're weaker than them.<br> If he's dead, if what you say is true,<br> then it won't matter.<br> It was his idea to hit the taxi service<br> in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.<br> It was all Keaton.<br> We followed him from the beginning.<br> I didn't know. I saw him die.<br> I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ!<br> You're not safe on your own.<br> - You think he's...<br> - Keyser Sze?<br> I don't know, Verbal.<br> Keyser Sze's a shield.<br> Or, like you said, a spook story.<br> But I know Keaton, and someone<br> is out there pulling strings for you.<br> - Stay and let us protect you.<br> - No way. I'm not bait. I post today.<br> You posted 20 minutes ago.<br> Captain Leo wants you out of here ASAP,<br> unless you turn state's.<br> I'll take my chances.<br> If someone wants to get you,<br> they're gonna get you out there.<br> Turn state's evidence.<br> You might never see trial.<br> Maybe so.<br> But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.<br> Fuckin' cops.<br> Excuse me. Can I use your fax machine?<br> You'll have to sign for these, Mr Kint.<br> One watch, gold.<br> One cigarette lighter, gold.<br> One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.<br> We've still got nothing, Dave.<br> I know what I wanted<br> to know about Keaton.<br> Which is nothing.<br> No matter. He'll have<br> to know how close we came.<br> Keyser Sze or no Keyser Sze,<br> if Keaton is alive,<br> he's not coming up again.<br> I'll find him.<br> Waste of time.<br> A rumour's not a rumour that doesn't die.<br> - What?<br> - Nothin'.<br> - Man, you're a slob.<br> - Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave.<br> It all makes sense when you look at<br> it right. You gotta stand back from it.<br> You wanna see a real horror show,<br> you should see my garage.<br> Convince me.<br> When I was in that barbershop quartet in<br> Skokie. Where's your head, Agent Kujan?<br> - We need to think back.<br> - You've heard many tales.<br> - Bricks Marlin.<br> - I wanna hear your story.<br> It's all there. Some guy in California,<br> his name is Redfoot.<br> - A gift from Mr Sze.<br> - What about Redfoot?<br> - Mr Redfoot knew nothing.<br> - Big, fat guy. I mean, orca fat.<br> There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.<br> When I was picking beans in Guatemala,<br> we'd make fresh coffee.<br> - You thought he was a good man.<br> - I know he was good.<br> - Tell me every last detail.<br> - How do you shoot the devil?<br> - He's protected by the Prince of...<br> - What's your story?<br> - There was a lawyer.<br> - What lawyer, Verbal?<br> - I am Mr Kobayashi.<br> - Kobayashi. Kobayashi.<br> - Tell me every last detail.<br> - I work for Keyser Sze.<br> Convince me. Convince me.<br> Every creep that works the street for a<br> living will know the name of Verbal Kint.<br> The cripple, did you see him?!<br> - The cripple! Which way did he go?<br> - That way.<br> I know you know something.<br> I'm smarter than you and<br> I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.<br> - To a cop, the explanation's simple.<br> - You know what I'm gettin' at! The truth!<br> - ... no arch criminal behind it all.<br> - Somebody with power.<br> - Keyser Sze!<br> - Who's Keyser Sze?<br> You think a guy like that comes this close<br> to getting caught and sticks his head out?<br> Because you're stupid, Verbal.<br> Because you're a cripple.<br> - Who's the gimp?<br> - You've known the whole fuckin' time!<br> - Who's Keyser Sze?<br> - Who's Keyser Sze?<br> - I'm sure Keaton is dead.<br> - I can't feel my legs, Keyser.<br> First thing I learnt on the job<br> was how to spot a murderer.<br> They tell me you got the cripple from<br> New York. He mention Keyser Sze?<br> Who?<br> After that... my guess is<br> you'll never hear from him again.<br> The greatest trick the devil ever pulled<br> was convincing the world he didn't exist.<br> And like that...<br> he's gone.<br>
