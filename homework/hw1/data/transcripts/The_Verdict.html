He says ''They got this new bar,<br> and you go inside, and for half a buck<br> you get a beer, a free lunch,<br> they take you in the back room<br> and get you laid.''<br> - Another one, Frankie?<br> - Yeah. Everyone.<br> Mike says ''Now wait a minute,<br> wait a minute, wait a minute.''<br> ''There's a new bar, and you go inside,<br> and for half a buck<br> they give you a beer,<br> a free lunch and they get you laid?''<br> Pat says ''That's right.''<br> ''Have you ever been in the bar?''<br> He said ''No, but me sister has.''<br> Hey!<br> Oh, yeah. Everyone.<br> Frankie?<br> Frankie! Frankie, you all right?<br> Oh, Frankie.<br> Come on, get up.<br> Get up, Frank! Oh, Christ.<br> What the hell's goin' on here?<br> What have you been doin'?<br> l got a call from Sally Doneghy.<br> Who's that?<br> You're in court in ten days,<br> and you haven't even met with them yet.<br> Sally Doneghy? Who is that?<br> One lousy letter in 18 months.<br> l try to throw a case your way, and look at ya.<br> Frankie,<br> l got these people to trust you.<br> They're gonna be here at noon,<br> by the way, and look at this shit.<br> l got this expert doctor to talk to ya.<br> Remember his name? Dr Gruber?<br> lt's been 18 months, and l've been<br> doin' all the fuckin' legwork.<br> You're due in court in less than two weeks,<br> and l bet you haven't even<br> looked at the goddamn file.<br> What are you, my nanny?<br> Now listen to me, Frankie.<br> Frankie, listen to me,<br> cos l'm done fuckin' with ya.<br> l can't take this any more.<br> l mean, you're not gonna change.<br> Look around ya.<br> l mean, what's gonna change?<br> You think it's gonna be any different<br> next week, next month?<br> lt's gonna be the same goddamn thing.<br> Now l got you a good case.<br> lt's a moneymaker.<br> You do it right, it'll take care of ya.<br> But l'm through, you understand?<br> l mean, l can't take this shit any more.<br> Life's too fuckin' short, Frankie.<br> l'm gettin' too fuckin' old.<br> Fuck!<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Mrs Doneghy. Hi. Frank Galvin.<br> - Why didn't you go in?<br> - lt's locked.<br> Locked?<br> l'm sorry.<br> God, l hope this didn't put you out.<br> Let me see here...<br> Come on in. l'd get you a cup of coffee,<br> but looks as though my girl went out.<br> lt's not a good case, it's a very good case.<br> A young, healthy woman goes into a hospital<br> to deliver her third child, and...<br> Well, it's just beyond comprehension.<br> She's given the wrong anaesthetic.<br> - We love her, Kevin and me.<br> - l'm sure you do.<br> But what can we do?<br> She don't know who's visiting her.<br> l know. l went.<br> - You saw her?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> My sister? You know how beautiful she was?<br> Her husband left her, and he took her kids.<br> They...<br> they let you die in there.<br> They don't care. Nobody cares.<br> The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care<br> in Arlington? They'd take her in.<br> Perpetual care.<br> $50,000 they want in endowment.<br> l don't wanna leave her. Kevin, he...<br> And Father Laughlin,<br> he said it was God's will.<br> Well, l understand.<br> My doctor told me l gotta move out West.<br> That's when we filed in court.<br> - We didn't wanna sue.<br> - Oh, l understand that too.<br> But Kevin's looking for two years in Tucson.<br> They called him up<br> and they said to come out.<br> He's a good man.<br> He's only trying to do what's right.<br> Come on in.<br> This is my husband.<br> Come on in. Sit down.<br> l told your wife, l'm sorry we have to meet<br> out here, but l got a case in superior court.<br> - The place is full of papers.<br> - That's all right.<br> - l was also telling her you got a good case.<br> - He saw her at Northern Care.<br> l may get some very important<br> corroborating testimony from a Dr Gruber.<br> lt'll be a problem getting one doctor to testify<br> that another doctor's negligent, but...<br> The archdiocese called and said who was<br> our attorney, cos the case is coming to trial.<br> Well... l doubt very much<br> that the case will ever come to trial.<br> We told them we didn't want it<br> to come out this way.<br> l completely understand.<br> - See, we just...<br> - We just can't do it any more.<br> This is our chance to get away.<br> l'm gonna see that you get that chance.<br> How much is this gonna cost?<br> lt's not gonna cost you anything.<br> lt's done on a contingency basis.<br> Whatever the settlement is, l retain a third.<br> But that's normal procedure.<br> You can check around.<br> OK?<br> OK.<br> His name is Frank Galvin. Boston College,<br> class of '52, was second in his class.<br> Editor of the Law Review.<br> Worked with Mickey Morrissey 12 years.<br> Criminal law and personal injury.<br> Married Patricia Harrington, 1960.<br> Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce,<br> Resigned the firm, 1969,<br> over the Lillibridge case.<br> - He was accused ofjury-tampering.<br> - Accused, not indicted. He resigned the firm.<br> Divorced, 1970. Galvin worked with Michael<br> Morrissey until Morrissey retired in '78.<br> Since then he's been on his own. Four cases<br> in three years. He's lost them all. He drinks.<br> Four cases in three years.<br> The man's an ambulance chaser.<br> - Tell me about this case.<br> - This is a nuisance suit.<br> He's asking for $600,000<br> and betting we don't want to go to court.<br> - No, we don't want this case in court.<br> - Neither does he. That's where he loses.<br> He's scared to death to go to court.<br> We only have to call his bluff.<br> l want to settle and be done with it. l don't<br> want the archdiocese exposed, Mr Alito.<br> No. Absolutely.<br> And we're going to see that it's not.<br> So, what l want to do is stop it here.<br> l'm going to make him an offer myself.<br> l want it to come from me.<br> All right. But let's keep the price down.<br> l called Ed Concannon. He recommends we<br> continue to respond as if we're going to trial.<br> lf we were to go to trial,<br> would we win the case?<br> Well, of course it's always dangerous.<br> l know that answer. Would we win?<br> Yes.<br> Dr Gruber?<br> Yes. Galvin, right?<br> Well... well, l sure appreciate<br> a man as busy as you are...<br> lt's perfectly all right. Look, l'm kinda rushed.<br> Do you mind if we walk while we talk?<br> l read the hospital report on your client.<br> Deborah Ann Kaye? They called. They want<br> to settle. lt's just a matter ofjacking 'em up.<br> - Who called?<br> - The archdiocese. They wanna settle.<br> - And you're gonna do that?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You're gonna settle out of court?<br> - Well, yeah.<br> Why?<br> ln the interests of her family.<br> And you, Doctor.<br> You can never tell what ajury's gonna do.<br> St Catherine's is a renowned institution.<br> - Her doctors are...<br> - Her doctors killed her.<br> - l'm sorry?<br> - Her doctors killed her.<br> They gave her the wrong anaesthetic,<br> and she drowned in her own vomit.<br> - The doctors murdered her.<br> - Do you know who her doctors were?<br> Yeah, l read the file. Marx and Towler.<br> l know who they were.<br> - Two of the most respected...<br> - l thought you wanted to do something.<br> l've no interest in the woman's estate.<br> No offence, we all know<br> where the money is going.<br> l have an interest in hospitals. l don't want<br> those bozos in the same profession as me.<br> They gave her the wrong anaesthetic, they<br> killed her and her kid, and you caught 'em.<br> You want a cigar?<br> No, thank you. The hospital's<br> owned by the archdiocese...<br> What are they gonna do?<br> Not invite me to their birthday party?<br> Look, l'm sorry l'm rushing,<br> but l have to be in Cambridge.<br> When can we get together again<br> and get a deposition?<br> OK. We'll meet here Tuesday night.<br> l gotta go. Are you goin' my way?<br> OK. But we're gonna have to<br> keep you under wraps, you know.<br> - You can't discuss the case.<br> - l understand.<br> You're gonna meet me here on Tuesday.<br> We'll go over your testimony.<br> Right. Seven o'clock in the locker rooms.<br> - l got it.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - My pleasure.<br> Why are you doin' this?<br> To do the right thing.<br> lsn't that why you're doing it?<br> Sorry. Nobody ever stood here since 1952.<br> Give me a Bushmill. Who are the civilians?<br> Lousy weather, good for business,<br> Frankie. There you go.<br> - Would you like a drink?<br> - l'd like an apartment.<br> Would you settle for a drink?<br> No. Thank you.<br> l had a good day today.<br> Let me at 'em.<br> Gentlemen...<br> - To ya.<br> - To ya. To ya.<br> l cut myself so badly shaving this morning,<br> my eyes almost cleared up.<br> Bad?<br> l'm glad you had a good day.<br> - Good night.<br> - Thank you.<br> Well, well, well, well, well. Hey.<br> lt's a long road that has no turning.<br> That's for sure, Frankie.<br> Yeah. l'm going to the archdiocese tomorrow.<br> At two.<br> Yes, l know you don't. l know you don't.<br> You're just following your own life.<br> You have a life to live too.<br> You have to go out West.<br> You're not gonna do yourself good here.<br> Well...<br> l'm sure she knows that you care for her.<br> - Well...<br> - She's so unprotected.<br> Finally, we're none of us protected.<br> l mean, we just... have to go on,<br> seek help where we can and go on...<br> She's stuck there.<br> Maybe she knows when we're there.<br> - Will she think we've abandoned her?<br> - Yes, l know that you love her.<br> l know that you're acting out of love.<br> As soon as l know.<br> - My husband sends his respects.<br> - Well, you give him my respects, too.<br> - Thank you. Sorry to call so late.<br> - Not at all. No, not at all.<br> Well...<br> Good night.<br> - God bless you, Mr Galvin.<br> - Well, bless you, too.<br> Good night.<br> ''Jimmy'' l said. ''You don't go<br> in your pocket if there's nothing there.''<br> And what did he say?<br> Sir, you're not allowed to be in here.<br> You can't be in here.<br> l'm her attorney.<br> lt's a question of continuing values.<br> St Catherine's, to do the good<br> she must do in the community,<br> must maintain the position<br> she holds in the community.<br> So... we have a question of balance.<br> On the one hand, our hospital,<br> its reputation, and so its effectiveness,<br> and that of two of its important doctors.<br> And on the other hand,<br> the rights of your client.<br> A young woman in her prime,<br> deprived of her life, her sight, her family.<br> lt's tragic. lt's a tragic accident.<br> Nothing, of course,<br> can begin to make that right.<br> But we must do what we can.<br> We must do all that we can.<br> Yes, we must try to make it right.<br> lt's a generous offer, Mr Galvin.<br> Nothing can begin to make that woman well,<br> but we could at least try to compensate,<br> make a gesture.<br> How did you settle on the amount?<br> We thought it was just.<br> You thought it was just?<br> Yes.<br> Because it struck me...<br> how neatly three went into<br> this figure - 210,000.<br> That means l would keep 70.<br> That was our insurance company's<br> recommendation.<br> Yes, that would be.<br> Nothing we can do<br> can make that woman well.<br> And no one will know the truth.<br> What is the truth?<br> That that poor girl put her trust into the...<br> the hands of two men who took her life.<br> She's in a coma.<br> Her life is gone.<br> She has no home, no family.<br> She's tied to a machine.<br> She has no friends.<br> And the people who should care for her,<br> her doctors,<br> and you and me,<br> have been bought off to look the other way.<br> We've been paid to look the other way.<br> l came here to take your money.<br> l brought snapshots to show you<br> so l could get your money.<br> l can't do it. l can't take it.<br> Because if l take the money, l'm lost.<br> l'll just be a...<br> rich...<br> ambulance chaser.<br> l can't do it. l can't take it.<br> lf we may discuss money, Mr Galvin,<br> how's your law practice?<br> Not too good.<br> l only got the one client.<br> Mick?<br> l gotta talk to you.<br> Mickey, come on. Hey, let's go get a drink.<br> Hymie, sit in for me, will ya?<br> - Are you out of your mind?<br> - l need your help.<br> You need my help?<br> You need a goddamn keeper.<br> Are you telling me<br> you turned down 210 grand?<br> What are you, nuts? What are you<br> gonna do, bring her back to life?<br> - l'm gonna help her.<br> - To do what?<br> To do what, for Christ's sakes?<br> Help her do what? She's dead!<br> - They killed her. They're trying to buy it.<br> - That's the fuckin' point, dummy!<br> Let them buy it.<br> No, we let them buy the case.<br> That's why l took it. Now, look,<br> you just drop this, you understand?<br> We'll go up to New Hampshire.<br> - We'll kill some fuckin' deer.<br> - Mick. Mick!<br> You said... No, listen to me!<br> - You said ''lf not now, when?''<br> - l know what l said. But not now, all right?<br> l'll tell you something else.<br> l can win this case.<br> But you won, Frank. You won!<br> When they give you the money,<br> that means you won.<br> Now, look, we don't wanna go to court.<br> ls this getting through to you?<br> Do you know who the attorney<br> for the archdiocese is? Ed Concannon.<br> - He's a good man.<br> - ''He's a good man''?<br> He's the prince of fucking darkness!<br> He'll have people testifying<br> they saw her water-skiing.<br> - Frank, don't fuck with this case.<br> - l gotta stand up for that girl.<br> Frank, l know you're trying<br> to wipe out some old business.<br> l understand that. l do. But not now.<br> - Call the bishop, will you?<br> - l'm gonna try this case. Will you help me?<br> l'm gonna need your help, Mick.<br> Will you help me?<br> Anybody ever hear<br> ''For want of a shoe, a horse was lost''?<br> Who's going on vacation tomorrow?<br> Friedman? St Barts, is that right?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Send Mrs Friedman a dozen roses<br> tomorrow morning, please, Sal.<br> No, wait a minute... Send her a sun lamp.<br> Friedman, l'm sorry, but you'll have to stay.<br> There'll be no vacations<br> until this thing is cleared.<br> You're all acquainted with this case.<br> lt's been on the calendar for 18 months.<br> Now l think we have a definite court date.<br> February 19th.<br> The plaintiff's attorney is Francis P Galvin.<br> l trust you're all familiar with his record.<br> We've been expecting him to call us<br> to negotiate, and as he did not,<br> five days before<br> we're supposed to go to court,<br> we made him a rather generous offer,<br> which he refused.<br> Five days before trial.<br> What does that mean? l want to find out.<br> Acquaint yourselves again<br> with the depositions.<br> Don't rely on the fact that<br> we did it last year. Do it again.<br> We shall be reviewing it here.<br> You do it at home.<br> You each have a full file, so know the deps.<br> l want you all to be here when we work<br> with the defendants. When is that, Billy?<br> Wednesday evening.<br> l want an article as soon as possible<br> in The Globe:<br> ''St Cat's, neighbourhood giant,<br> serving the community,'' et cetera.<br> They've got it in the files.<br> And l want something in the Herald<br> Monday morning: ''Our gallant doctors.''<br> Be inventive.<br> And television. We've gotta have television.<br> Friedman, since you're still with us,<br> why don't you have a word<br> with your friend at GBH?<br> Now, to belabour the obvious for a moment,<br> our clients are the Archdiocese of Boston,<br> the St Catherine Labour Hospital,<br> and Doctors Marx and Towler, two of the<br> most respected men in their profession.<br> The thrust of this defence will be to answer,<br> in the court, the press, and the public mind,<br> to answer the accusation<br> of negligence this completely<br> that not only do we win the case,<br> but win the case so that it is seen<br> that this attack on these men and<br> this institution was a rank obscenity.<br> OK, let's get the cobwebs off. Billy?<br> Please turn to your page four.<br> We're gonna review the depositions of<br> the nurse anaesthetist, the scrub nurse,<br> and all those in attendance in the OR<br> at the time of the operation.<br> - So, what have we got?<br> - Well, we've got her sister.<br> Says Deborah Ann ate a full meal an hour<br> before she was admitted to the hospital.<br> And we got the admittance form<br> says she ate nine hours before.<br> The sister's testimony's no good.<br> The jury knows if we win, she gets the cash.<br> We got my Dr Gruber. He says<br> she was given the wrong anaesthetic.<br> And, anyway, she came in<br> complaining of nausea.<br> - Well, Gruber's not bad.<br> - He's Dr Kildare. The jury'll eat him up.<br> Yeah. But their guy is Towler.<br> He wrote the book: Methodology<br> and Practice in Anesthesiology.<br> Everybody in that operating room signed<br> a deposition, from the scrub nurse on up:<br> ''All those guys are God.<br> l saw them walk on water.''<br> They had an obstetric nurse.<br> Did we get a deposition from her?<br> No.<br> Maureen Rooney, aged 49, lives in Arlington.<br> Still works at the hospital.<br> Think you could talk to her,<br> ask why she ain't speakin' up?<br> Yeah.<br> - OK.

Dr Marx, of<br> course. Maureen Rooney, obstetric nurse...<br> And what did these people do<br> when her heart stopped?<br> - We went to Code Blue.<br> - Code Blue?<br> Do you mind explaining to the jury<br> what that means?<br> lt's a common medical expression. lt's<br> a crash programme to restore the heartbeat.<br> Dr Marx cut an airway in her trachea so<br> she could get oxygen - she and the baby.<br> - Miss Nevins...<br> - Why wasn't she getting oxygen?<br> - Many reasons, really.<br> - Tell me one.<br> - She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask.<br> - She threw up in her mask.<br> Cut the bullshit, please. Just say it.<br> ''She threw up in her mask.''<br> She threw up in her mask.<br> Therefore she wasn't getting oxygen<br> and her heart stopped?<br> - That's right.<br> - And what did your team do then?<br> You brought 30 years of medical experience<br> to bear. lsn't that what you did?<br> A patient riddled with complications, with<br> questionable information on her charts.<br> - We did everything we could.<br> - To save her, to save the child.<br> - You reached down into death.<br> - We tried to save her.

Please, sir.<br> Humour me.<br> Here is the address. The key is right inside.<br> Treat the place as your very own and...<br> But please, please, don't call anybody.<br> And thank you...<br> thank you very much for coming.<br> - How's our new witness?<br> - Did you find the obstetric nurse?<br> She's working the night shift at the hospital.<br> She's home now. l'll take a run over there.<br> Give me the address. l'm goin'.<br> We're gonna need her.<br> Hi.

He's the assistant chief<br> anaesthesiologist at Mass Commonwealth.<br> He says that your doctors, Towler and Marx,<br> put my client in a hospital for life.<br> We can prove that.<br> See, what we don't know is why.<br> What went on in there,<br> in the operating room?<br> l mean, something happened.<br> You know what it was.<br> They gave her the wrong anaesthetic.<br> Now, something happened!<br> There was a distraction.<br> What? The telephone? What?<br> You have your doctor.<br> What do you need me for?<br> We need someone<br> who was in the operating room.<br> We're gonna win the case.<br> There's no question of that.<br> lt's simply a matter of how big.<br> - Well, l don't have anything to say to you.<br> - You know what happened.<br> - Nothing happened.<br> - Then why don't you testify for their side?<br> l can subpoena you, you know.<br> l can put you up there on the stand.<br> And ask me what?<br> Who turned my client<br> into a goddamn vegetable?<br> - l didn't do it.<br> - Who are you protecting?<br> - Who says l'm protecting anyone?<br> - Doctors? What do you owe them?<br> - l don't owe them a goddamn thing!<br> - Then why don't you testify for them?<br> - You're very pushy, fella.<br> - You think l'm pushy now.<br> - Wait till l get you up there on the stand!<br> - Well, maybe you just better do that, then!<br> You know, you guys are all the same.<br> You don't care who you hurt.<br> All you care about is a dollar.<br> You're a bunch of whores!<br> You've got no loyalty... no nothing.<br> You're a bunch of whores!<br> Thank you.<br> His name is Dr Lionel Thompson.<br> City College of New York,<br> class of '28.

We'll be at Locke-Ober's.<br> They gave her the wrong anaesthetic -<br> under the circumstances.<br> Why is that?<br> Her sister said she ate<br> one hour prior to admittance.<br> That's what her sister says. The admittance<br> form says she ate nine hours prior.<br> She went in complaining of nausea.<br> A good doctor would have doubted<br> the information on the chart.<br> ls that what a good doctor would do?<br> - How old are you, Doctor?<br> - l'm 74 years old.<br> And what makes you<br> an expert in anaesthesiology?<br> l'm on the staff of anaesthesiology,<br> Easthampton Hospital for Women.<br> The Easthampton Hospital for Women?<br> What is that, ajoke?<br> Let me tell you something, Doctor.<br> Those men at Catherine Labour, known<br> not only in this city but in the world,<br> were trying to save a woman's life.<br> They were there.<br> And here you are, four years later...<br> l made a detailed physical examination<br> of the patient, sir.<br> ls she getting good treatment over there?<br> Well, actually, it's...<br> Yes.

Be seated.<br> Deborah Ann Kaye versus<br> St Catherine Labour Hospital<br> and Robert S Towler MD<br> and Sheldon F Marx MD.<br> ls the plaintiff ready?<br> - We are, Your Honour.<br> - Defence?<br> - Ready for the defence, Your Honour.<br> - Let's begin.<br> Your Honour,<br> ladies and gentlemen of the jury,<br> it's a terrible thing to sit in judgment.<br> So much rides on it.<br> l know that you have thought<br> ''How can l be pure?''<br> ''How can...<br> how can l be impartial without being cold?''<br> ''How can l be...<br> merciful, and still be just?''<br> l know that some of you<br> have said prayers today<br> to be helped to judge correctly.<br> We have the reputation of two men,<br> two well-respected doctors before us,<br> and a renowned hospital.<br> And with them we have<br> my client, Deborah Ann Kaye,<br> who was deprived of sight,<br> of speech, of hearing,<br> of locomotion, of...<br> Well, in short, everything<br> that constitutes her life.<br> We will prove that she was deprived<br> through negligence,<br> through the negligence<br> of these respected men.<br> We will show, one...<br> Why did he go to see Maureen Rooney?<br> She's the only nurse who isn't testifying.<br> - And what did he find?<br> - Nothing.<br> How good's your intelligence?<br> Very good.<br> So what is the rest of his case,<br> aside from this Dr Thompson?<br> As far as we know, nothing.<br> Thank Mr Concannon for me.<br> Please tell him l'll see him in his office.<br> Good morning, Doctor. Dr Thompson,<br> just so the jury knows,<br> you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.<br> - ls that correct?<br> - That is correct.<br> l was engaged to render an opinion.<br> ''Engaged to render an opinion''<br> for a price. That is correct?<br> - You are being paid to be here?<br> - Just as you are, sir.<br> Are you board-certified<br> in anaesthesiology?<br> No, l'm not. lt's quite common<br> in New York State to practise...<br> Yes, l'm quite sure it is,<br> but this is Massachusetts.<br> Are you board-certified in internal medicine?<br> No.<br> - Neurology?<br> - No.<br> Orthopaedics?<br> l'm just an MD.<br> Do you know Dr Robert Towler?<br> - l know of him.<br> - And how is that?<br> - Through his book.<br> - What book is that?<br> Methodology and Practice...<br> ..in Anesthesiology.<br> Methodology and Practice in Anesthesiology.<br> Yes.<br> - How old are you, Doctor?<br> - l'm 74 years old.<br> Do you still practise quite a lot of medicine?<br> l'm on the staff of anaesthesiology...<br> Yes. Yes, l've heard that.<br> But you do testify quite a bit<br> against other physicians.<br> lsn't that correct? You are available for that,<br> so long as you're paid to be there.<br> Sir, yes.<br> When a thing is wrong,<br> as in this case, l am available.<br> l'm 74 years old.<br> l'm not board-certified.<br> l've been practising medicine for 46 years,<br> and l know when an injustice has been done.<br> Do you, indeed?<br> l bet you do. That's fine.<br> Fine.<br> Let's save the court time.<br> We'll admit Dr Thompson<br> as an ''expert witness''.<br> Mr Galvin, do you want to continue now?<br> Or we could resume this afternoon.<br> l'll continue, Your Honour.<br> Dr Thompson,<br> did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye at the<br> Northern Chronic Care Facility last night?<br> - l did.<br> - Objection.<br> Sustained. The witness will confine his<br> testimony to review of the hospital records.<br> Dr Thompson, in your review of<br> the hospital records of May 12th 1976,<br> in your opinion,<br> what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?<br> Cardiac arrest.<br> During delivery her heart stopped.<br> When the heart stops,<br> the brain is deprived of oxygen.<br> You get brain damage.<br> That's why she's in the state she's in today.<br> Dr Towler has testified that he restored<br> the heartbeat in three to four minutes.<br> ln your opinion, is that an accurate estimate?<br> ln my opinion, it took much longer - nine,<br> ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.<br> Are you saying failure to restore<br> heartbeat within nine minutes<br> in itself constitutes bad medical practice?<br> - Your Honour!<br> - Yes, Mr Galvin?<br> lf l may be permitted to question<br> my own witness in my own way...<br> - l'd like to get to the point.<br> - l am getting to...<br> l believe l have the right<br> to ask the witness a direct question!<br> Now let's not waste these people's time.<br> Answer the question, Mr Witness, please.<br> Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring<br> the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?<br> ln that small context, l would have to say no.<br> Then you're saying there's no negligence,<br> based on my question?<br> - Given the limits of your question, yes.<br> - The doctors were not negligent.<br> Thank you.<br> l'm not through questioning...<br> Your Honour, with all due respect,<br> if you're gonna try my case for me,<br> l wish you wouldn't lose it.<br> Thank you. l think<br> that's enough for this morning.<br> l'll see counsel in my chambers.<br> - Now, please!<br> - All rise.<br> Court is adjourned until one o'clock.<br> l'm gonna write to the Board<br> of Bar Overseers about you today, fella.<br> You're on your way out. They should have<br> kicked you out in that Lillibridge case.<br> Now, this is it, today.<br> l'm an attorney,<br> on trial before the Bar,<br> representing my client.<br> My client. When you open your mouth,<br> you're losin' my case for me.<br> - Listen to me, fella...<br> - No, you listen to me!<br> All l wanted out of this trial was a fair shake.<br> You push me into court five days early,<br> l lose my star witness,<br> and l can't get a continuance.<br> And l don't care.<br> l'm goin' up there, l'm gonna try it, and<br> let the jury decide. They told me about you.<br> Said you're a hard-ass,<br> you're a defendant's judge.<br> Well, l don't care.<br> l said to hell with it. To hell with it!<br> Look, Galvin, many years ago l...<br> Come on! Don't give me that shit<br> about you bein' a lawyer too.<br> l know about you.<br> You couldn't hack it as a lawyer.<br> You were a bagman for the boys downtown,<br> and you still are.<br> - Are you done?<br> - You're damn right l'm done.<br> l'm gonna ask for a mistrial. l'll request<br> that you disqualify yourself from this case.<br> l'll take a transcript of the trial<br> to the Judicial Conduct Board<br> - and ask them to impeach your ass!<br> - You aren't gonna get a mistrial, boy.<br> We're going back,<br> and we're gonna try this case to the end!<br> Get out of here before l call the bailiff<br> and have you thrown in jail!<br> What does it mean?<br> l mean, you have other tactics?<br> Oh, yeah. They present their case, then<br> l get a chance, and we just cross-examine.<br> Are we gonna win? l mean,<br> you have other tactics, though?<br> Yeah.<br> Thank you, Dr Towler.<br> No further questions, Your Honour.<br> - Dr Towler?<br> - Yes.<br> - Let's work backwards.<br> - Yes.<br> You have a record of what happened<br> in the operating room.<br> You made notations every 30 seconds<br> of the procedures.<br> These notations stop four and a half minutes<br> after Deborah Ann Kaye's heart stopped.<br> Four and a half minutes after her heart<br> stopped. They resumed three minutes later.<br> We had more on our minds than taking notes.<br> We were trying to restore her heartbeat.<br> - What happened in those three minutes?<br> - We were trying...<br> - What happened?<br> - Objection, Your Honour.<br> Why did it take so long<br> to restore her heartbeat?<br> Almost nine minutes to restore her heartbeat,<br> which caused massive<br> irreversible brain damage.<br> You're not allowing the witness to answer.<br> Thank you, Your Honour.<br> l would like to answer.<br> Brain damage could have...<br> lt didn't necessarily take<br> nine or eight minutes.<br> lt could have been caused in two.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You're saying that her brain damage<br> could have been caused<br> by being deprived of oxygen<br> for two minutes?<br> Yes.<br> Why is that?<br> lt's right there on her medical chart.<br> She was anaemic. Less blood, less oxygen.<br> The brain was getting less oxygen anyway.<br> l didn't do too well for you.<br> You did fine.<br> No, l'm afraid that's not true.<br> Will you want me to stay on till Monday?<br> No, thank you. You can go on home.<br> You know, Mr Galvin,<br> sometimes people can surprise you.<br> Sometimes they have<br> a great capacity to hear the truth.<br> Yeah. Yes.<br> - Sure you don't want me to stay on?<br> - No. Thank you.<br> You can go on home.<br> l'll see you back at the office.<br> - What happened?<br> - lt's bad.<br> What are you going to do now?<br> l don't have a goddamn idea.<br> - What do you do if you don't have a witness?<br> - You use their witness.<br> - That's right.<br> - Well, l think we've tried that, Francis.<br> The case is over.<br> You know, you broke the first rule<br> l taught you in law school:<br> You never ask a question<br> unless you have the answer to it.<br> Even your own expert witness<br> said there was no negligence.<br> lt's over, period.<br> - There'll be other cases.<br> - There are no other cases. This is the case.<br> There are no other cases. This is the case.<br> There are no other cases. This is the case.<br> No other cases, this is the case.<br> l know how you feel.<br> You don't believe me, but l do know.<br> l'm gonna tell you something<br> that l learned when l was your age.<br> l had prepared a case, and old man White<br> said to me ''How did you do?''<br> And l said ''l did my best.''<br> And he said<br> ''You're not paid to do your best.<br> You're paid to win.''<br> And that's what pays for this office,<br> pays for the pro bono work<br> that we do for the poor,<br> pays for the type of law<br> that you want to practise.<br> lt pays for my whiskey.<br> lt pays for your clothes.<br> lt pays for the leisure we have to sit back<br> and discuss philosophy,<br> as we're doing tonight.<br> We're paid to win the case.<br> You've finished your marriage. You wanted<br> to come back and practise the law.<br> You wanted to come back to the world.<br> Welcome back.<br> Why isn't Maureen Rooney testifying?<br> Hey! You with me? You awake?<br> - Yeah, l'm awake.<br> - She's protecting somebody.<br> Who is she protecting?<br> Doctors?<br> lf she's protecting the doctors,<br> she'd be on the witness stand.<br> Read me what she said.<br> ''You guys are a bunch of whores.<br> Loyalty. Don't care who you hurt.''<br> - ''You guys got no loyalty.''<br> - One of the nurses?<br> Who? Everybody who was in<br> the operating room is testifying.<br> All right. Who wasn't in the operating room?<br> The admitting nurse?<br> - What does she do?<br> - She took down the history.<br> And she signed it here. ''KC.'' Kaitlin Costello.<br> - The history?<br> - Yeah.<br> ''How old are you?<br> How many children do you have?''<br> ''How old are you? How many children<br> do you have? When did you last eat?''<br> Oh, Miss Rooney.<br> l understand what you're doing,<br> and l just wanted you to know that it's OK.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Well, about Kaitlin Costello.<br> l mean, l don't blame you for shielding her.<br> - l spoke to her today.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - l talked to her this morning, and...<br> - l know. She told me.<br> - She told you?!<br> - l just saw her.<br> ln New York? You saw Kat in New York?<br> Or is she in town? ls she in town?<br> Thank you. l'm sorry.<br> All right. Thank you.<br> Don't we have anything<br> from the New York Nurse Association?<br> - That broad has disappeared.<br> - From the hospital?<br> Well, there's no records since she quit in '76.<br> She quit two weeks after the incident.<br> - Thank you.<br> - l have to talk to you.<br> l can't talk now.<br> Call the AMA. Tell 'em you're Dr Somebody<br> and you need to find a nurse,<br> get some forms, somebody's dying.<br> Mrs Costello? l'm sorry to bother you this<br> late, but this is Mr Goldberg in Accounting.<br> We have some money here for you.<br> ls this the Mrs Costello, the registered nurse?<br> l see.

''Contraindications<br> of General Anesthetic.''<br> ''A patient should refrain from<br> taking nourishment up to nine hours<br> prior to induction of general anesthetic.''<br> Sound familiar?<br> Yes. l wrote it.<br> Methodology and Practice in Anesthesiology.<br> A general textbook on the subject,<br> is that correct?<br> l...<br> Yes, it is.<br> - And you wrote it?<br> - Yes.<br> Page 414.<br> ''lf the patient has taken nourishment<br> within one hour prior to inducement,<br> general anesthetic should be avoided<br> because of the grave risk<br> the patient will aspirate<br> food particles into his mask.''<br> ls that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?<br> She aspirated food particles into her mask?<br> She threw up in her mask, yes.<br> But she hadn't eaten<br> one hour before admission.<br> lf she had eaten an hour before<br> being admitted to the hospital,<br> then the inducement of a general<br> anaesthetic would have been negligent?<br> Negligent? Yes, it would have been criminal.<br> But such was not the case.<br> Thank you.<br> - Mr Concannon?<br> - No further questions, Your Honour.<br> Thank you, Dr Towler.<br> Mr Galvin, rebuttal?<br> Kaitlin Costello Price.<br> Kaitlin Costello Price.<br> State your name, please.<br> Kaitlin Costello Price.<br> Do you swear the evidence you give<br> will be the whole truth, so help you God?<br> - l do.<br> - Be seated.<br> - Kaitlin Price.<br> - Yes.<br> You were the admitting nurse<br> at St Catherine Labour on May 12th, 1976,<br> the night that they admitted<br> Deborah Ann Kaye?<br> Yes.<br> Did you sign this admission form?<br> - Yes.<br> - Those are your initials, ''KC''?<br> Kaitlin Costello.<br> That's my maiden name.<br> Did you ask the patient<br> when did she last eat?<br> Yes.<br> What did she say?<br> She said she'd had a full meal<br> one hour before coming to the hospital.<br> - One hour?<br> - Yes.<br> And did you put the numeral ''one''<br> on this admission sheet?<br> l mean, standing for ''one hour''?<br> l did.<br> A single hour?<br> Yes.<br> Thank you.<br> Your witness.<br> Anything?<br> You're aware of the penalties for perjury?<br> - lt's a crime.<br> - lt is a crime. A serious crime.<br> - l wouldn't do it.<br> - You would not?<br> No.<br> You've taken an oath<br> that you would not commit perjury.<br> - You've just sworn to that, isn't that right?<br> - Yes.<br> - Just now.<br> - Yes.<br> You have sworn before God<br> that you would tell the truth.<br> Yes.<br> Now, l want to ask you something.<br> Four years ago,<br> when you were working as a nurse,<br> are you aware that<br> these doctors, Marx and Towler,<br> based their treatment of<br> Deborah Ann Kaye on this admitting form,<br> which you signed?<br> l...<br> Wasn't that an oath?<br> These are your initials, ''KC.''<br> When you signed this form, you took an oath<br> no less important than that<br> which you've taken today.<br> lsn't that right?<br> - lsn't that right?<br> - Yes.<br> Then which is correct?<br> You've sworn today that the patient<br> ate one hour before admittance.<br> Four years ago you swore that<br> she ate nine hours before admittance.<br> All right, which is the lie?<br> - l...<br> - These men could have settled out of court.<br> They wanted a trial to clear their names.<br> And you would come here, and on a slip of<br> memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.<br> - They lied.<br> - They lied?! They lied!<br> When did they lie?<br> - Do you know what a lie is?<br> - l do, yes.<br> You swore on this form<br> that the patient ate nine hours...<br> - That's not what l wrote.<br> - You just told me that you signed it.<br> l signed it, yes.<br> But l didn't write a nine.<br> l wrote a one.<br> You didn't write a nine, you wrote a one.<br> And how is it that you remember<br> so clearly after four years?<br> Because l kept a copy.<br> - l have it right here.<br> - Objection!<br> We can't accept a copy<br> when the court already has the original.<br> l'll rule on that presently.<br> Please, proceed.<br> What in the world induced you to make<br> a photocopy of an obscure record<br> and hold it for four years?<br> Your Honour, this...<br> Why would you do that?<br> - l thought l might need it.<br> - And why would you think that?<br> After...<br> after the operation,<br> when that poor girl, she went into a coma,<br> Dr Towler called me in.<br> He told me<br> that he'd had five difficult deliveries in a row<br> and he was tired.<br> And he never looked at the admittance form.<br> And he told me to change the form.<br> He told me to change the one<br> to a nine.<br> Or else, he said... He said he'd fire me.<br> He said l'd never work again.<br> Who were these men?!<br> Who were these men?!<br> l wanted to be a nurse!<br> No further questions, Your Honour.<br> You may step down.<br> Mr Galvin?<br> Nothing further, Your Honour.<br> Mr Concannon?<br> Mr Concannon.<br> Thank you, Your Honour. We object<br> to the copy of the admitting form,<br> and we cite McGee versus<br> the State of lndiana, United States 131.2.<br> ''The admission of a duplicate document<br> in preference to an existing original<br> must presuppose the possibility of<br> alteration and so must be disallowed.''<br> And, Your Honour, having<br> given the plaintiff the leeway,<br> we would like your ruling on this issue now.<br> We object to the admission<br> of a Xerox photocopy.<br> One moment, Mr Concannon.<br> Yes. The document is disallowed.<br> - Objection!<br> - Overruled.<br> - Exception!<br> - Noted. Thank you.<br> Legally, he's right.<br> The jury will not consider the testimony<br> of Miss Costello regarding the Xerox form.<br> lt is unsubstantiated.<br> We cannot accept a copy<br> in preference to the original.<br> Thank you, Your Honour. Furthermore,<br> Miss Costello is a rebuttal witness.<br> As the court knows, no prior notice<br> was given of Miss Costello's appearance.<br> And as a surprise witness, she may<br> serve only to rebut direct testimony.<br> As her only evidentiary rebuttal is the<br> admitting form which has been disallowed,<br> l request that<br> her entire testimony be disallowed,<br> and that the jury be advised to totally<br> disregard her entire appearance here.<br> - Yes, l'm going to uphold that.<br> - Objection.<br> - Overruled.<br> - Exception.<br> Noted. Thank you.<br> The jury will be advised not to consider<br> the testimony of Miss Costello.<br> Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.<br> The sole rebuttal was the document,<br> which has been disallowed.<br> Her entire testimony<br> must be stricken from the record.<br> You shouldn't have heard it.<br> That was my mistake.<br> You must strike it from your minds.<br> Give it no weight!<br> Legally, it's over.<br> Concannon was brilliant.<br> Tell me about Kaitlin Costello.<br> There's nothing to tell.<br> lt's been stricken from the record.<br> l know. But did you believe her?<br> Mr Galvin?<br> Mr Galvin? Summation?<br> Well...<br> You know, so much of the time,<br> we're just lost.<br> We say ''Please, God,<br> tell us what is right, tell us what is true.''<br> l mean, there is no justice.<br> The rich win, the poor are powerless.<br> We become tired of hearing people lie.<br> And after a time we become dead.<br> A little dead. We think of ourselves...<br> as victims.<br> And we become victims.<br> We become...<br> we become weak.<br> We doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs.<br> We doubt our institutions.<br> And we doubt the law.<br> But today you are the law.<br> You are the law.<br> Not some book, not the lawyers.<br> Not a marble statue,<br> or the trappings of the court.<br> See, those are just symbols<br> of our desire<br> to be just.<br> They are...<br> they are, in fact, a prayer.<br> l mean, a fervent and a frightened prayer.<br> ln my religion<br> they say ''Act as if ye had faith,<br> and faith will be given to you.''<br> lf...<br> if we are to have faith in justice,<br> we need only to believe in ourselves,<br> and act with justice.<br> See, l believe there is justice in our hearts.<br> Have you reached a verdict?<br> We have, Your Honour.<br> Your Honour, we've agreed to hold<br> for the plaintiff, Deborah Ann Kaye,<br> and against St Catherine Labour,<br> and Doctors Towler and Marx.<br> But, Your Honour, are we limited<br> on the size of the award?<br> What l mean, sir...<br> Are we permitted to award an amount greater<br> than the amount the plaintiff asked for?<br> You are.<br> You're not bound by anything other than<br> your good judgment, based on the evidence.<br> Please retire, and when you've agreed<br> on the amount of the award...<br> You did it, Frank.<br> Way to go, Frank.<br>
