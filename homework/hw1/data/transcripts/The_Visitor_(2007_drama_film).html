She's in Florida.<br> So I'm living alone now, and it's nice,<br> but I tell you, there are so many<br> new people in this building,<br> - and Mr. Sprinkles and I...<br> - It's nice to see you again, Jacob.<br> It's good to see you.<br> Good to see you. Welcome home.<br> Thank you.<br> Bye-bye. Bye-bye.<br> Stop it.<br> Come on, honey.<br> We find that,<br> under these circumstances,<br> financial globalization<br> can be beneficial.<br> Empirically, it's good institution<br> and quality of government<br> that will allow third world countries<br> to benefit and harvest<br> the fruits of globalization.<br> Great stuff, huh?<br> Maybe we should have 'em<br> come play inside.<br> Uh, you coming?<br> In a minute. Uh, I gotta make a call.<br> - Oh. Uh, see you inside.<br> - Okay.<br> - ##<br> - Hey, Walter.<br> Welcome home.<br> Hi.<br> How was the conference?<br> It was fine.<br> Sorry about the pants.

Thanks.<br> You sure you won't have some?<br> I don't drink.<br> She's a good Muslim. I'm a bad one.<br> Are you finished?<br> Yes. Uh... can I help you?<br> No. Please.<br> It's the least I can do.<br> Well, thank you for dinner.<br> It was very good.<br> - You're welcome.<br> - Thank you.<br> So what's the conference about?<br> Economic growth<br> in developing nations.<br> That's us. Syria, Senegal.<br> So have you written some books?<br> Three, and I'm working on a fourth.<br> - Four books.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Wow. That's great.<br> My father was a writer. A journalist.<br> Is he still writing?<br> No. He died before we left Syria,<br> almost nine years ago.<br> Sorry.<br> Me, too.<br> - Tarek.<br> - Mmm.<br> Mmm. We have to go.<br> I have a gig.<br> Walter, you can come if you want.<br> Oh, no. I've got some work<br> I have to get done. Thank you.<br> Okay.

You liked it?<br> Yeah. It was very good.<br> I was not sure.<br> I thought it's too loud and you know.<br> Tarek?<br> Oh.<br> Hi.<br> Sounded good, Walter.<br> I'm sorry. I...<br> No. Don't be sorry.<br> That's what it's there for.<br> I was lying<br> on my bed, listening to my music,<br> and then I was, like...<br> what's that crazy rhythm I'm hearing?<br> Sit. Come on. I'll show you.<br> Just put your feet flat on the ground.<br> Now take the drum<br> between your legs like this.<br> Now you want to take<br> the inside edge off the ground<br> with your ankles, like this.<br> Great.<br> You're okay?<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Now, Walter, I know<br> you're a very smart man,<br> but with a drum<br> you have to remember not to think.<br> Thinking just screws it up. Okay?<br> Okay.<br> Now, give it a couple of bangs.<br> Not so hard. You're not angry at it.<br> Okay. I'm sorry.<br> Okay.<br> Better. Did you think?<br> No.<br> Good.<br> Now, one more thing, Walter.<br> You listen to classical music,<br> so you think in fours.<br> Dah, dah, dah, dah.<br> This is an African drum,<br> so we're gonna be playing in threes.<br> Tak tak tak.<br> You have to forget your classical.<br> Leave it behind. Tak tak tak.<br> Come on, follow me.<br> Tak tak tak.<br> Tak tak tak.<br> Don't worry. Start again.<br> Good.<br> Don't worry.<br> Again.<br> Good.<br> You got it.<br> Go...<br> - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> - Don't worry.<br> Don't worry. Go again.<br> Good.<br> That's it.<br> Now, keep it going, and I'll do this.<br> There you go.<br> Hohh!<br> Hello.<br> Hi.<br> Is Tarek home?<br> Uh, no. He, uh...<br> he went to look at another apartment.<br> Are you okay?<br> Yes.<br> Tarek's been giving me drum lessons,<br> and I was just practicing.<br> Don't worry. I'll keep my pants on.<br> What?<br> Nothing.<br> It's just that earlier, uh...<br> No, nothing.<br> Which is due, in large part,<br> to the delay in African infrastructure<br> and the slowdown on steel imports.<br> Hey, Walter!<br> How did the presentation go?<br> Oh, fine. Thanks.<br> Cool.<br> - You ready?<br> - Yeah.<br> Let's go.<br> - Can you grab this drum?<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> You might want to take off<br> your, uh, name tag.<br> Oh, okay.<br> You hungry?<br> Yeah, I'm starving.<br> You like shawarmas?<br> Yeah, I like sharmas.<br> Shawarmas.<br> Here. This is for you.<br> For letting us stay.<br> Oh. Thank you.<br> It's Fela Kuti. You know him?<br> Nope.<br> - You don't know Fela?<br> - No.<br> Then, Walter, you're in for a treat.<br> He started the whole Afrobeat movement.<br> Oh, and his drummer, Tony Allen,<br> was just... whoo, scary, man.<br> You want to play drums,<br> you have to listen to this.<br> Okay. I will.<br> Ooh.<br> Did you make these?<br> Yes, I made these.<br> Ooh.<br> - How much?<br> - Which one?<br> Mmm...<br> this one.<br> That's $35.<br> Will you take 30?<br> No. 35.<br> Okay.<br> My daughter will think this is very cool.<br> Where are you from?<br> Senegal.<br> Oh, I was in Cape Town<br> two summers ago.<br> It is so beautiful.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - What's your name?<br> Uh, Zainab.<br> Zainab!<br> So pretty.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Your change.<br> How far is Senegal from Cape Town?<br> About 8,000 kilometers.<br> I told this guy yesterday<br> I was from Israel.<br> He asked if I ever visited the Holy Land.<br> Hey, look who it is!<br> - Zev.<br> - What's up, Tarek?<br> How are you, man?<br> Good, man.<br> Hey, honey.<br> Hi. Hi, Walter.<br> Hi.<br> Her stuff is great, right?<br> Beautiful.<br> She made me this.<br> It's very nice.<br> So Walter and I<br> are goin' up to the park<br> to play for a little bit, okay?<br> Tarek. Remember I told you<br> we have to pick up<br> my new table today?<br> He said he'll only hold it for today.<br> Oh, I know, I know. No problem.<br> Tarek, you always say "No problem,"<br> and then you are late or you forget.<br> I know. I...

It means "beloved one."<br> Does she know that?<br> I always wanted to play down here.<br> It's supposed to be good money.<br> Why haven't you?<br> Maybe we could do it together...<br> split the profits.<br> What do you think?<br> I think I'll just watch.<br> Come on, Walter, it's easy.<br> You just wait until you feel it.<br> Yeah, let's go.<br> Oh...<br> That was fun, right?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> How are your hands?<br> They're...<br> Oh, shit. We have to get home.<br> Zainab's gonna kill me.<br> I'm on Arab time again.<br> What is Arab time?<br> It means I'm late by an hour.<br> All Arabs are late by an hour.<br> It's genetic.

I'm not hungry.<br> Okay. Well, if you change your mind,<br> I'll leave some in the fridge.<br> Thank you.<br> Have you heard from Tarek?<br> No. Not yet.<br> Oh. Well...<br> I made an appointment<br> with an immigration attorney<br> for tomorrow morning at 11.<br> No. We can't afford that.<br> That's okay.<br> Thank you, Walter.<br> Walter.<br> I was in detention...<br> when I first arrived, for five months.<br> How did you get out?<br> They... closed the facility<br> and released some of the women.<br> They didn't release any of the men.<br> We'll get him out.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Okay.<br> Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> Sir, that detainee has been moved.<br> He was here yesterday.<br> Well, he's not here now.<br> That's all I know.<br> You can call I.C.<br> The number's on the wall.<br> Where?<br> On the wall by the phone<br> and the water fountain.<br> Next.<br> Sir, step aside, please.<br> Hi.

Um...<br> I have a... a letter from her.<br> Oh, you can't give it to me.<br> It has to be sent to me by mail.<br> Oh.<br> But... But you can put it up to the glass.<br> Go ahead. Open it up<br> and press it up to the glass<br> so I can read it.<br> It's okay. It's allowed.<br> You want to say hello to pap?<br> Oh...<br> Thank you, Walter.<br> So how are they treating you?<br> It's very depressing here.<br> There's no privacy.<br> The lights are always on.<br> You need anything?<br> No. I just want to get out of here.<br> Well... Zainab and I met<br> with a lawyer today.<br> Yes? What did he say?<br> Well, he's... he's gonna<br> stop by tomorrow and see you.<br> Tarek. Zainab said<br> that you were denied asylum.<br> You mean when we came here?<br> Yeah.<br> Did you go to your deportation hearing?<br> Yeah.<br> In Michigan.<br> Yeah. We did everything they told us to.<br> Okay.<br> Let's go, man. You gotta get off.<br> Bed count.<br> I have to go.<br> They have to do a bed count.<br> Usually, I can visit for one hour.<br> Could you come tomorrow?<br> - I will.

Bye.<br> Walter, I'm going to leave now.<br> I have a cousin who lives in the Bronx.<br> I'm going to go<br> stay with him for now.<br> You don't have to go.<br> You can stay here.<br> I think it's better I leave.<br> Um... you know how to reach me<br> if you need to.<br> Is it okay if I leave<br> Tarek's things here for now?<br> Uh, my cousin's place is...<br> not very big.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello?<br> Oh. Hi, Charles.<br> Oh. Wait. I'm sorry. Wha... What?<br> Yeah. The conference went very well.<br> Yes.<br> No, uh, actually, I'm still in New York,<br> and I'm doing some research for my book.<br> Why?<br> When's the meeting?<br> Wha...<br> Oh. Okay.<br> All right. I... I'll, um...<br> I'll leave first thing tomorrow.<br> Yeah. I'll see you at 3. Bye.<br> I thought you said<br> you went to the hearing.<br> We did. I remember it.<br> Well, then why is there<br> a final order out on you?<br> He didn't know yet. He just said<br> that unless they can find a way<br> to reopen the case quickly,<br> they're going to deport me.<br> I don't even understand it.<br> Walter, there are guys<br> who have been in here for years.<br> I can't do that, Walter. I'll go crazy.<br> He's trying to deal with the case<br> as quickly as possible.<br> I know. I know. It's...<br> It's just...<br> Look, maybe we<br> should call your mother.<br> No. No. I don't want her to worry.<br> Yeah.<br> Tarek, um...<br> I have to go back to Connecticut.<br> When?<br> Tomorrow.<br> But I'll be reachable<br> by phone if you need anything.<br> And I'll be back to visit. It's not far.<br> Okay.<br> Just please...<br> don't forget about me in here.<br> No, I won't.<br> So have you been practicing?<br> Yes.<br> You should go back to the drum circle.<br> No.<br> Okay, but listen to that Fela CD.<br> That will help you.<br> - I promise.<br> - I will. I will.<br> So show me what you...<br> you've been working on.<br> What?<br> Show me. Why not?<br> Here?<br> Come on. I need some music, man.<br> Don't worry. They can't arrest you.<br> At least, not yet.<br> Mmm...<br> Come on.<br> Good.<br> Oh, no. An elbow.<br> Hello.<br> Oh, I'm sorry. I must've got<br> - the wrong apartment.<br> - Can I help you?<br> I'm looking for my son.<br> Excuse me.<br> Uh, are...<br> are you Tarek's mother?<br> Yes.<br> Well, this is Tarek's apartment.<br> I j...<br> I share the apartment with him.<br> He didn't mention<br> that he lived with someone.<br> Well, I'm not here very often.<br> I... I live in Connecticut.<br> Is Tarek here?<br> No. He's not here now.<br> Uh, come in... please.<br> Please.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, my name is Walter. Walter Vale.<br> I'm... I'm Mouna Khalil.<br> I'm sorry to show up unannounced.<br> My son hasn't called me for five days.<br> I keep trying his cell phone,<br> but he doesn't answer.<br> Would you like to sit down?<br> Thank you.<br> Mr. Vale?<br> Is my son all right?<br> Yes.<br> He's been arrested.<br> He's being held in a detention center.<br> Where?<br> In Queens.<br> Uh, they're tying to deport him.<br> How did this happen?<br> He was stopped in a subway station.<br> Uh... he didn't... didn't<br> do anything wrong.<br> I'd like to go there, to Queens.<br> Okay.<br> But, Mrs. Khalil, um, the lawyer m...<br> Uh, I just don't<br> think it's possible for you...<br> Mr. Vale, I know I cannot visit Tarek.<br> I just want to see the place<br> where they're holding him.<br> Okay.<br> I can take you there.<br> Thank you.<br> Could we go now?<br> So have you been<br> to New York before, Mrs. Khalil?<br> No. Tarek wanted to come to New York<br> to play music.<br> I did not want him to, but...<br> Do you have<br> any children, Mr. Vale?<br> A son. He lives in London.<br> And your wife?<br> My wife passed away.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's it.<br> - This is where the prison is?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> It doesn't look like a prison.<br> I think that's the point.<br> How many people are in there?<br> Tarek said about 300.<br> There's, uh...<br> There's a coffee shop on that corner.<br> - It's not very nice.<br> - I'll wait there.<br> Walter. I thought you were leaving.<br> I was.<br> Tarek, your mother is here.<br> What? My mother? Where?<br> She's waiting outside.<br> When did she arrive?<br> Today.<br> Man. Why did she come?<br> She can do nothing for me.<br> Well, she said<br> she hadn't heard from you.<br> Walter, listen to me.<br> She... She can't stay here.<br> She doesn't know<br> anyone in New York.<br> I'm sorry, but you must get her<br> to go back to Michigan.<br> Okay. Okay, I'll try.<br> Thank you, Walter.<br> I have a note from her.<br> Need anything else?<br> No, thank you.<br> Hello, sir.<br> Hi.<br> How is he?<br> Oh, he's good. He's good.<br> Um... but...<br> he's very concerned<br> about you being here.<br> I will not leave.<br> Mrs. Khalil, I don't... I don't think<br> your being in New York will do any good<br> because we have a very good lawyer<br> working on Tarek's...<br> Mr. Vale.<br> I will not go back to Michigan<br> knowing that my son is in that building.<br> Even if I can't see him...<br> I will stay here.<br> Shall we go?<br> Uh madame?<br> Bye.<br> Mr. Vale?<br> I'm leaving now.<br> Thank you for your help.<br> Where are you going?<br> I'll find a hotel.<br> You can stay here.<br> You can use Tarek's room.<br> Thank you for your offer,<br> but I cannot accept it.<br> I don't want to impose on you.<br> You're not imposing.<br> Please. I would like you to stay.<br> Thank you.<br> But I will manage.<br> Good-bye.<br> Good-bye.<br> Um... Mrs... Mrs. Khalil?<br> Please.<br> I was with Tarek<br> when he was arrested.<br> He was in the subway<br> in the first place because of me.<br> So...<br> please.<br> Even if it's just for one night.<br> Um, the bathroom is across the hall.<br> Thank you, Mr. Vale.<br> No. Call me Walter.<br> And I'm Mouna.<br> So... do you need anything else?<br> No, thank you.<br> Well... good night.<br> Good night.<br> Okay?<br> Bye.<br> Oh. Good morning.<br> Morning.<br> Mmhh...<br> Tarek says hello.<br> How is he?<br> I can't really tell.<br> He wants me to leave.<br> Well... you're welcome to stay here<br> as long as you need to.<br> Thank you.<br> That's very generous of you.<br> Well... thank you for the paper.<br> You're welcome.<br> Do you spend a lot of time in the city?<br> No, no. Not really.<br> I'm just here<br> presenting a paper at a conference.<br> Well...<br> You wrote it?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Congratulations.<br> I co-authored it, really.<br> And what happened after the hearing?<br> We appealed. It took two years.<br> And your appeal was denied?<br> Yes.<br> And did they send you<br> your bag-and-baggage letter?<br> - No.<br> - What's that?<br> Basically, it tells you<br> where to show up and be deported.<br> But you didn't receive it?<br> No. I would remember this.<br> Did you move?<br> Eventually, we had to.<br> But we had our mail advanced.<br> Is it possible that it<br> just never got there?<br> Yeah, it's happened before.<br> And pre-9/11, it wasn't much of a priority<br> trackin' people down,<br> but if you got it and you just ignored it,<br> then there's nothing I can do.<br> So... you can help him.<br> I'm gonna try.<br> But you should know it's still a long shot.<br> The government's approach<br> has changed radically.<br> It's very black and white now.<br> Either you belong, or you don't.<br> Tarek's lucky.<br> Most of them don't even have lawyers.<br> Lucky.<br> Relatively speaking.<br> We just have to move quickly<br> to get an emergency stay,<br> and then we'll stick with a motion<br> to reopen, pending his green card application.<br> Yeah?<br> Okay.<br> Can you explain<br> what that means, please?<br> Actually, I don't have<br> the time right now.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I have to be in court very shortly.<br> How long will he be in detention?<br> I can't predict that. I am sorry,<br> but I am gonna have to wrap this up.<br> Do you have any children, Mr. Shah?<br> Yeah. Two kids.<br> And for what it's worth,<br> my uncle was deported<br> after raising a family here for 23 years.<br> If I can get your son out... I will.<br> Thank you.<br> Where are you from?<br> Queens.<br> Which one is she?<br> The one closest to us.<br> That black woman?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> That is Zainab?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> She's very black.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Zainab.<br> Oh. Hi, Walter.<br> Uh, Zainab, this is Mouna Khalil...<br> Tarek's mother.<br> - Oh...<br> - Hello, Zainab.<br> Oh, I...<br> It's a pleasure<br> to meet you, Mrs. Khalil.<br> You, too.<br> Uh... I'm s... I'm sorry.<br> I... I didn't know<br> you were coming.<br> Neither did I.<br> Your jewelry is very nice.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Do you think we can go out<br> for a cup of tea sometime?<br> Oh... yeah.<br> We could go right now.<br> I... I am...<br> I'm just watching Zev's table,<br> but I... um...<br> I just need to... find someone to...<br> Hey.<br> Hi.<br> Is it a necklace?<br> I think so.<br> I like that one in the front.<br> Um...<br> It's all handmade.<br> Ooh.<br> I've lived here for two years,<br> and I was in France<br> for a year before that.<br> Do you miss home?<br> Yes, sometimes.<br> But I don't want to live there.<br> Do you miss Syria?<br> Sometimes, too.<br> I miss Damascus...<br> the smell.<br> But this is my home now.<br> When did you meet Walter?<br> Walter? Uh...<br> about ten days ago.<br> Ten days? That's all?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> How did you meet him?<br> Uh...<br> through Tarek's friend.<br> Ivan. That's how we<br> ended up living there.<br> You live there, too?<br> Just for a little while.<br> Oh.<br> So... have you spoken to Tarek?<br> Yes.<br> He called me this morning.<br> He sounded in a good spirit.<br> I was so afraid this was going to happen.<br> Tarek used to tease me<br> that I worry too much.<br> But now...<br> I just don't know what to do.<br> I miss him so much.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Zainab.<br> I'd like you to do something for me.<br> I'd like you to show me<br> something you and Tarek like to do,<br> somewhere you like to go.<br> Like what?<br> Whatever you like.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> So what is in Staten Island?<br> I don't know.<br> We would just go there<br> and then come back.<br> We never got off.<br> Why?<br> It was free.<br> We felt like we were going somewhere.<br> Oh. That's where the Twin Towers were.<br> I never saw them, but... Tarek did.<br> Oh. And...<br> there's the Statue.<br> And behind that is Ellis Island.<br> Sometimes Tarek would point at the Statue<br> and jump up and down<br> like we're arriving<br> in New York for the first time.<br> It was very funny.<br> Can you go up in the Statue?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I think so.<br> You haven't been there?<br> No.<br> Never?<br> Nope.<br> Oh.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hello?<br> Hey, Charles.<br> What's that?<br> Um, yeah. I'm still in New York.<br> I'm sorry, Charles.<br> I couldn't make it back yesterday.<br> I said I couldn't make it back!<br> Well, I'm on a boat.<br> A boat!<br> Listen, Charles, I'll explain it to you<br> when I see you.<br> But I have to go now,<br> so I'll call you back.<br> Bye.<br> You went on the ferry?<br> Yes.<br> No.<br> - My mother, too?<br> - She liked it.<br> You know that they don't even have<br> an outside space here.<br> They just have a room<br> with its roof cut out.<br> Really?<br> Some crazy stuff, man.<br> And they seemed to get along...<br> Zainab and my mother?<br> Yes. I think your mother<br> likes her very much.<br> My mother's not going home, is she?<br> I don't think so.<br> I know she's thinking about my father.<br> Why?<br> He spent seven years in jail in Syria<br> because of something<br> he wrote in the newspaper.<br> By the time<br> they released him, he was very sick.<br> He died two months later.<br> That's why we moved here.<br> Would you like a glass of wine?<br> No, thank you.<br> Mouna. Um...<br> I need to go back to Connecticut<br> tomorrow, for work. I told Tarek.<br> How long will you be gone?<br> Um, I don't know yet. I...<br> I'll try to get back<br> and visit him as soon as I can.<br> Walter, you don't have<br> to keep visiting him.<br> I'm sure you're busy.<br> I'll see what I can do.<br> Dinner will be ready soon.<br> Oh. Okay.<br> Walter. Do you go to Broadway?<br> No, not really.<br> Tarek sent me the CD<br> I think I know every word.<br> Tarek is teaching me the drum.<br> Really? How is that going?<br> Well, I... I sound a lot better<br> when he's playing with me.<br> How's your teaching?<br> My teaching?<br> Yes.<br> It's fine.<br> How many classes do you have?<br> Well, I have a lighter schedule<br> so I can focus on my book.<br> Your book?<br> What is it about?<br> Well, it... covers quite a bit,<br> so it's hard to explain.<br> You're almost finished?<br> I'm close.<br> Ahem.<br> You don't like<br> to talk about your work?<br> Mmm, it's, uh... just not a process<br> that's easy to talk about<br> with somebody who's not a writer.<br> Oh.<br> I shouldn't have<br> spoken to you like that.<br> It's okay.<br> - I'll get it, sir.<br> - Thanks.<br> Well...<br> um, you have my number<br> if you need anything.<br> Thank you. I'll be fine.<br> Here.<br> Thank you.<br> Have a safe trip.<br> Thanks.<br> Good-bye.<br> Good-bye.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Hi, Mouna. It's Walter.<br> Uh, no. I was, uh, just checking in<br> to make sure everything was okay.<br> Okay. Oh, good.<br> Uh, you know... working.<br> Okay. So... good.<br> Good night.<br> Walter.<br> Hello.<br> I didn't expect you so soon.<br> Um, I just was cleaning a bit.<br> I love this CD.<br> Is it your wife?<br> Yes.<br> She was beautiful.<br> Thank you.<br> These are different glasses?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> They're new?<br> They are, yeah.<br> They're nice.<br> Thank you.<br> I was going to cook some lunch.<br> Are you hungry?<br> Yes. That would be nice.<br> Okay.<br> Mouna?<br> Yes.<br> Mmm, I was wondering.<br> Um, uh, Thursday night.<br> Do you have any plans?<br> No, Walter. I have no plans.<br> Okay. Well, then, I thought...<br> maybe we might do something.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> - They keep moving people.<br> - To where?<br> I don't know. I think<br> to other detention centers.<br> Two Moroccan guys were just moved.<br> They had no idea.<br> Suddenly, they were just gone.<br> Has anyone said anything to you?<br> No. No one in here knows anything.<br> This is not fair.<br> I am not a criminal.<br> I have committed no crime.<br> What do they think?<br> I'm a terrorist?<br> There are no terrorists in here.<br> The terrorists have money.<br> They have support.<br> This is just not fair.<br> - I know.<br> - How do you know? You're out there.<br> I'm sorry. I... Um...<br> I sit in here at night, and...<br> I keep thinking about Zainab.<br> I just want to live my life<br> and play my music.<br> What's so wrong about that?<br> Okay.<br> Okay. Please do.<br> Yeah. Thank you.<br> Okay. Bye.<br> What did he say?<br> That he'd make some calls,<br> but they can move him<br> to another facility at their discretion.<br> What facility? Where?<br> He said it could be anywhere.<br> Upstate Pennsylvania.<br> There's even one in Louisiana.<br> Louisiana?<br> Where they had the floods?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> But that's too far.<br> Yeah.<br> Did the lawyer say anything else?<br> No. He didn't know anything else.<br> It's just like Syria.<br> Okay.<br> Bye, habibti. Good-bye.<br> Sorry to keep you waiting.<br> That's okay. How is he?<br> He says hello.<br> He wants to make sure<br> you're practicing your drum.<br> I am. So...<br> You look very nice.<br> Thank you.<br> You, too.<br> Thank you.<br> Okay. That's good.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> You ready?<br> For what?<br> Well...<br> uh, I thought we'd go see this.<br> Really?<br> Yeah.<br> Now?<br> Yeah. Is that okay?<br> Yes. That's wonderful.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm so excited.<br> Okay. Don't move.<br> You know...<br> I think that show<br> was really kind of scary.<br> It was a little scary. Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Are you finished?<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> How was everything?<br> - Great.<br> - Very good.<br> Actually, I think<br> I'd like a glass of wine, please.<br> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't even think to ask.<br> It's okay.<br> It's not every night<br> that you see The Phantom.<br> I'll have a Cabernet.<br> Cabernet.<br> Two, please.<br> Excellent.<br> Well, I haven't been to the theater<br> in a long time. Me, neither.<br> There's a place in Syria called Malula.<br> It's a very big outdoor theater.<br> It's beautiful.<br> We used to take Tarek there<br> to see concerts.<br> - Here you go. Two Cabernets.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Well.<br> Cheers.<br> Mmm.<br> Mouna. Um...<br> I'm taking a leave of absence...<br> uh, for the rest of the semester.<br> Ahem.<br> Really? Why?<br> Well, I thought I might<br> spend some more time in New York.<br> Walter, you don't<br> have to do this. You're busy.<br> No, I want to.<br> But you have to be in Connecticut.<br> You have your teaching, your book.<br> No, it's fine. Really.<br> This is not your problem, Walter.<br> It's okay that you're busy.<br> I'm not busy.<br> Not at all.<br> The truth is I haven't done any real work<br> in a very long time.<br> But you just<br> presented your paper at the conference.<br> No. No. No, I didn't even write it.<br> I just read it.<br> I've been teaching<br> the same course for 20 years,<br> and it... doesn't mean anything to me.<br> None of it does.<br> I pretend.<br> I pretend that I'm busy,<br> that I'm working, that I'm writing.<br> I'm not doing anything.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Don't be.<br> I really appreciate you telling me this.<br> Um, Walter.<br> What would you do if you didn't teach?<br> I don't know.<br> It's kind of exciting not to know.<br> What time is it?<br> Uh, 12:30.<br> My God. Is it?<br> Yeah. I think that happens<br> a lot in New York.<br> It's...<br> Thank you, Walter.<br> It was a lovely evening.<br> It's the most fun I had in a long time.<br> Yeah, I told Tarek<br> I was taking you tonight, and I did.<br> I think he was happy about it.<br> Thank you.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> There's a message from Tarek.<br> Something's wrong.<br> What did he say?<br> He said they were moving him.<br> He didn't know what it meant.<br> We should go.<br> Okay. When do you expect him?<br> All right. When he gets in,<br> could you have him<br> call me as soon as possible?<br> Uh, please.<br> It's an emergency. Thank you.<br> God, he's still in court.<br> Come on, come on,<br> come on. Can you hurry?<br> Sorry, sir.<br> I hate this feeling.<br> Um... I'm here for bed 38... Tarek Khalil.<br> Visiting hours start at 5 p.m.<br> What? I'm sorry. Excuse me?<br> - Visiting hours are at 5 p.m.<br> - Oh. Um,<br> it... I...
