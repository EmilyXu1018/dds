They've drawn a fence<br> Them plow-pushers must have<br> put it up there last night.<br> I'll fix this.<br> (COWBOYS SHOUTING)<br> FARMER: Cow herders!<br> COWBOY: Hey, cornhuskers!<br> JUDGE BEAN: Shad Wilkins,<br> you've been tried and found guilty<br> of the most serious crime<br> west of the Pecos,<br> to wit, shooting a steer.<br> Got anything to say for yourself before<br> the sentence of the court is executed?<br> I told you they shot at me first!<br> I didn't mean to kill that steer on purpose!<br> I was aiming at the man.<br> It's your bad luck you missed him.<br> That's the trouble with you sodbusters,<br> you can't shoot straight.<br> (CROWD LAUGHING)<br> Shad,<br> may the Lord have mercy<br> on your soul. Hey!<br> Buck, I want to see you.<br> COWBOY 1:<br> Well, how's the hanging, there?<br> COWBOY 2: Well, his neck didn't hardly<br> stretch a foot.<br> Here's to the greatest woman<br> in the world,<br> - Lily Langtry.<br> - Miss Langtry.<br> Did you hear the toast, stranger?<br> To Lily Langtry?<br> I thought you meant your friends.<br> That includes every man<br> that drinks at my bar.<br> Glad to join you.<br> Have you ever met Miss Langtry?<br> No, I never met her. I never met the sun,<br> I never shook hands with the moon,<br> and I've never been introduced<br> to no clouds.<br> That's all right. Too bad Lily Langtry<br> couldn't have heard that.<br> No, I was in England once,<br> but didn't get around to it.<br> Oh, you was in England once,<br> and you could have seen her,<br> - but you never got around to it, eh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Get out of my bar.<br> - Huh?<br> - To the Jersey Lily.<br> - COWBOY 1: Miss Langtry.<br> All right, Mort, if Shad's good and cold,<br> you can have him.<br> (EX CLAIMS)<br> $4, that's all he had.<br> I'll make it up to you on the next one.<br> Get off.<br> - What you got there?<br> - A horse thief, Judge.<br> - Get in there.<br> - JUDGE BEAN: Chickenfoot, the law.<br> CHICKENFOOT: Hear ye, hear ye, court<br> of Vinegarroon is now in session.<br> We caught him on Chickenfoot's horse<br> that was stole last week.<br> - My horse Pete? Where's he at?<br> - Right outside.<br> Well, so it is. Pete.<br> No, Your Honor.<br> I was just trying to get the lay of the land.<br> - You will, too, at the end of a rope.<br> - JUDGE BEAN: Southeast, no anticipating.<br> Hey, Judge! Judge, that is my old<br> sabino pony. He's tied right out there.<br> People of Vinegarroon again...<br> You can use any name you like.<br> JUDGE BEAN: What are you doing<br> in Vinegarroon?<br> - Oh, just passing through.<br> - Homesteader?<br> - No.<br> - JUDGE BEAN: Where do you hail from?<br> - No place in particular.<br> - JUDGE BEAN: Where are you heading for?<br> - No place special.<br> - Oh, saddle bum, huh?<br> Well, it's all right to live on a horse<br> if it's your own horse.<br> Bart, turn loose the prisoner's hands.<br> Chickenfoot, swear him in.<br> (MUMBLING) Do you swear<br> to tell the truth... So help you?<br> JUDGE BEAN: Well, now, I'll tell you, son...<br> Are you Bean?<br> - Judge Roy W. Bean.<br> - My name's Jane Ellen Mathews.<br> Yes, Miss Mathews, what can I do for you?<br> - What have you done with Shad Wilkins?<br> - Shad Wilkins?<br> when some of your wranglers came up<br> and took him away.<br> Oh, yeah, he was hanging around out there<br> a while back, but he ain't around now.<br> Your men not only took him away,<br> but they tore down the fence.<br> Not a stick of it was left standing.<br> JUDGE BEAN: That so?<br> Yes, that's so, and you needn't pretend<br> you don't know about it.<br> Well, it don't surprise me none.<br> It's against the law<br> - What law? Whose law?<br> - Mine.<br> - Now, you listen to me, Mr. Bean.<br> - Judge Bean.<br> You're no more a judge than I am.<br> Just call yourself a judge.<br> I wouldn't say that if I was you.<br> I might consider it contempt of court.<br> It's contempt, all right.<br> You call this a court?<br> I do, and it happens to be<br> in session right now.<br> Now, you sit down, Miss Mathews,<br> and I'll tend to your case in a minute.<br> You're charged with stealing a horse.<br> Guilty or not guilty?<br> - JUDGE BEAN: Where's exhibit A?<br> - Huh?<br> Where's the horse?<br> Bring in the horse, Chickenfoot.<br> Miss Mathews, when cattle can't get<br> to water, they die.<br> There's miles of river on each side<br> of our homestead.<br> This country's unfenced rangeland.<br> It always was, and always will be.<br> CHICKENFOOT: Get in there. All right,<br> give me room there, you guys.<br> Whoa, Pete. Come on in here.<br> Come on, get over there.<br> Give us a little room.<br> Mr. Harden, it's my duty to inform you<br> that the larceny of an equine<br> is a capital offense, punishable by death,<br> but you can rest assured that,<br> in this court,<br> a horse thief always gets a fair trial<br> before he's hung.<br> - Chickenfoot, that's your horse?<br> - Oh, why, Judge...<br> Can you prove it's your horse?<br> Why, Judge, anybody here... I can prove<br> it by Pete himself that he's my horse.<br> Pete, you're my horse, ain't you?<br> Ownership of horse clearly established.<br> It belongs to Chickenfoot.<br> Well, I don't contest it, Your Honor.<br> Maybe the horse does belong<br> to Chickenfoot here, but I didn't steal it.<br> - How'd you get it then?<br> - I bought it.<br> JUDGE BEAN: Order in the court!<br> - That all you got to say?<br> No, it's not. I'm not going to stay here<br> and see anybody railroaded like this.<br> Miss Mathews, I don't recollect you was<br> summoned as a witness in this trial.<br> What kind of a trial is it when a prisoner<br> isn't even allowed to have anybody<br> speak for him?<br> You an attorney, Miss?<br> I'm as much an attorney<br> as you are a judge.<br> - You know this man?<br> - No, I don't.<br> - You ever see him before?<br> - No, but...<br> - Can you prove he didn't steal the horse?<br> - No.<br> Then he don't need no lawyer then.<br> This man was caught on a stolen horse,<br> and in this jurisdiction,<br> that's prima facie evidence.<br> - The case is closed and that's my ruling.<br> - Yes, and it's just like all your rulings!<br> The courtroom will now be cleared<br> of everybody,<br> excepting the judge, the jury, the prisoner,<br> the witnesses and...<br> I guess that means you.<br> All right, I'll go.<br> It's murder, that's what it is. Murder.<br> This man hasn't got a chance,<br> but you never give anybody a chance.<br> You didn't give us one when you<br> stampeded the cattle over our crops.<br> You thought you'd starve<br> the homesteaders out, but you didn't.<br> You can pester us and rob us and kill us,<br> but you can't stop us.<br> 'Cause there'll always be more coming.<br> More and more.<br> And we'll stay on our farms in spite of you,<br> and your courtroom and your killers!<br> By gobs, she's all right.<br> She'd make a good cattleman.<br> If it wasn't for Lily, I'd marry her.<br> Giddap.<br> You heard the case against the accused,<br> pro and con.<br> Now I guess maybe you'd better retire<br> to consider a verdict.<br> (HORSE HOOVES CLOPPING)<br> Chickenfoot, you'd better take<br> Pete out for a little fresh air.<br> Take him out, Bart. I got work to do.<br> And while you retire,<br> there'll be a recess for them that's thirsty.<br> Well, I guess you can't take it with you.<br> It's got to be strictly understood<br> you ain't making no effort to influence<br> the sober judgment of the jury.<br> - Certainly not.<br> - There you are.<br> - Compliments of the prisoner.<br> - Jury to the rear!<br> Bull's-eye.<br> - Join me, Your Honor?<br> - Don't mind if I do.<br> Don't spill none of that liquor, son.<br> It eats right into the bar.<br> To the unfortunate lady<br> with the bullet in her face.<br> The man that fired that bullet<br> was hauled out of here feet first.<br> Any man that'd shoot at a picture<br> of Lily Langtry ought to be killed.<br> It's just retribution.<br> It's justifiable homicide,<br> Right.<br> You an admirer of Miss Lily's, too?<br> Well, that's putting it mildly.<br> She's the most beautiful woman<br> I ever met.<br> Met?<br> You mean to tell me you met Lily Langtry,<br> the real her, in the flesh?<br> What an actress.<br> How'd you get to know her?<br> Well, that's a long story, Judge.<br> Bart, you and Blackjack<br> get yourself a drink, huh?<br> Mighty fine liquor. What do you call it?<br> - Rub of the brush. Go on.<br> - Did you get to know her real well?<br> - It's got character.<br> I said, did you get to know her real well?<br> Now, Judge, you forget a gentleman<br> never discusses a lady in a barroom.<br> Who said it's a barroom?<br> This is a courtroom.<br> Say, tell me,<br> is she as pretty as them pictures?<br> Why, the picture's never been made<br> that can do justice to Lily Langtry.<br> Is she good-natured?<br> An angel.<br> - I'll never forget the night we met.<br> - Yeah?<br> I'll never forget it as long as I live.<br> Who was that?<br> Oh, that's Mort Borrow.<br> Go on about Lily.<br> Oh, yeah, Lily.<br> How about a verdict?<br> Can't you see<br> SOUTHEAST: Two aces.<br> COWBOY 1: Bet a dollar and a half.<br> Get away from here.<br> You smell of formaldehyde!<br> You been down around Lanno Bay,<br> ain't you?<br> Well, you know how it is at sunset.<br> You can look out and that water ain't<br> exactly blue, and it ain't exactly purple.<br> It's a kind of color a man can feel,<br> but he can't put a name to.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, that's Lily's eyes.<br> By gobs!<br> COWBOY 1: I'm out.<br> COWBOY 2: I'll stay out. Here we go.<br> COWBOY 3: Got 10. Got a nine.<br> You know how bright<br> and coppery and gold-like<br> a young chestnut horse<br> is running in the bright sun?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well, her hair is something like that.<br> In the daytime.<br> You mean it's different at night?<br> Well, not different,<br> - How so?<br> - Well...<br> Well, you know how it is at dusk when<br> you see a prairie fire reflected in the sky.<br> A sort of a deep...<br> A beautiful kind of blushing...<br> - Red?<br> - Red.<br> - Well, that'll give you a rough idea.<br> - By gobs.<br> I got a lock of her hair.<br> (JUDGE BEAN STUTTERS)<br> You mean to tell me you actually got<br> the real... From her head?<br> I don't suppose you'd ever part<br> with that lock of hair,<br> no matter what a man was willing to give?<br> A man don't trade things like that.<br> You see that sword up there?<br> I wore it in the civil war.<br> Always meant to be buried with it.<br> Now, if you was willing to swap, why...<br> Would you really like to have it?<br> I'd rather own it than the state of Texas.<br> Let's have a look at it.<br> I haven't got it with me.<br> Where's it at?<br> It's with my stuff in El Paso.<br> So, you was in the civil war, huh, Judge?<br> - El Paso, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Cavalry, huh?<br> - I suppose you could write for it.<br> Yeah.<br> Wouldn't take long to get here<br> by mail coach.<br> Oh, two, three weeks.<br> - Two or three weeks, huh?<br> - Yeah, about.<br> But I wouldn't part with that lock of hair<br> for anything in the world.<br> (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)<br> The jury's ready, Judge.<br> JUDGE BEAN: That bottle of whiskey<br> gone already?<br> Yeah, and if he ain't paid for it,<br> you better start collecting now.<br> - What's the verdict?<br> - You know what the verdict is. Guilty.<br> There's only one thing I can do.<br> You're sentenced to hang,<br> that's my ruling.<br> - But, Judge, you just ruled...<br> - I didn't finish my ruling.<br> The court sentenced the prisoner to hang,<br> but the court didn't say when.<br> So long as there's reasonable doubt...<br> What reasonable doubt, Judge?<br> We just caught him<br> - Ain't any room for doubt.<br> - Order!<br> I been talking to the prisoner.<br> He's a friend of Lily Langtry's.<br> Stands to reason no friend of Lily Langtry<br> goes around stealing horses.<br> Leastways, there's a reasonable doubt.<br> You mean,<br> That ain't what I said.<br> When I make a ruling, it stands.<br> But, Judge, you just sentenced the man.<br> His sentence is suspended<br> for a couple weeks<br> until I can look into the matter further.<br> - Hi, Mort. How's business?<br> - Just lost a customer.<br> Well, I'll be down for a shave in a minute.<br> All right, you're next.<br> - Howdy, Judge.<br> - Hello, Evans.<br> Jersey Lily special.<br> Pardon me, you don't happen<br> to have a twin brother, do you?<br> No, not me.<br> Well, you'd better pay me that money<br> you owe me:<br> You're loco, brother.<br> I don't owe you nothing.<br> $60.<br> If you're interested, that's the man<br> that sold me the roan horse.<br> Then, he's the man that stole...<br> $84 and 6 bits.<br> Fined $80 for disorderly conduct,<br> and $4 and 6 bits<br> Now, you men get some rope<br> and string him up.<br> We hang horse thieves, don't we?<br> String him up!<br> Come inside, son.<br> You can have his horse and outfit.<br> - Rub of the brush?<br> - Rub of the brush.<br> - El Paso.<br> - El Paso.<br> (SNORING)<br> (SNORING STOPS ABRUPTLY)<br> (SNORING RESUMES)<br> (JUDGE BEAN MUMBLING)<br> (CLANKING)<br> Good morning, Judge.<br> Who are you?<br> Who are you?
