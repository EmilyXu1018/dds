                        - Kate.<br> - Merton, no!<br> - Where did you go all morning?<br> - Went to the park.<br> All on your own?<br> I was supposed to meet a friend.<br> She didn't turn up.<br> Too much powder.<br> Close your eyes.<br> Try to look as if you've<br> worn it all your life.<br> It's yours.<br> - Do you remember my niece?<br> - Kate.<br> I didn't recognize her.<br> You've quite transformed her.<br> Yes, I know. She's finally<br> left her wretched father.<br> I've been trying to arrange it since<br> her mother died. She's my ward now.<br> - You'll just have to come and see us more often.<br> - She doesn't look very happy.<br> She will be.<br> This life is still new to her.<br> - Does she know anyone here?<br> - Just you for the time being.<br> Well, I shall have to go<br> and say hello.<br> How are you settling<br> into your new life?<br> - I'm very comfortable.<br> - You look preoccupied.<br> - I'm not used to all this.<br> - Your aunt's something of an expert at these occasions.<br> How do you mean?<br> She has a wonderful eye<br> for who fits best with who.<br> She suggested I be your guide.<br> Over there in that corner,<br> we have Lady Baring and her daughter.<br> - Do you see them?<br> - Yes.<br> Now, what Lady Baring has to do<br> is somehow manoeuvre her daughter...<br> from that side of the gathering<br> to the other...<br> without falling in the fountain.<br> - Do you see the man in the red waistcoat?<br> - Yes.<br> - He's the target.<br> - Why?<br> Because of<br> his father's bank account.<br> The Barings have to pay<br> for their castle somehow.<br> As do we all.<br> - You have a castle too, Lord Mark?<br> - Well, it's seen better days.<br> I spend more time<br> in my London home.<br> But you must let me<br> entertain you in both.<br> With your aunt, of course.<br> Of course.<br> Thwack. Robin Hood<br> couldn't have shot straighter.<br> That's ridiculous. The upper class<br> isn't going to change of its own accord.<br> Why should it?<br> That's exactly what I'm saying.<br> They're only using reform to fool us.<br> - The supposedly radical...<br> - Who's behind this class conspiracy?<br> I'm not saying it's a conspiracy.<br> They're just protecting themselves...<br> Kate! Hello.<br> A little too blind to see.<br> - I completely disagree.<br> - That's the most cynical point of view I have...<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Hey. You can't just leave in the middle of an argument.<br> I just have.<br> I thought she'd forgotten<br> her old friends.<br> I didn't expect<br> to see you here again.<br> - So how was the wedding?<br> - Awful.<br> Didn't Aunt Maud find you<br> a suitable husband?<br> She tried.<br> Have you thought<br> any more about my offer?<br> I haven't thought about anything else<br> since the day I met you.<br> The same thought for a whole year?<br> Must be very tiring.<br> Why don't I go straight to your Aunt<br> Maud and ask for your hand in marriage?<br> - All right.<br> - What would she do?<br> - Aren't I good enough for you?<br> - You're not good enough for her.<br> - Is that really necessary?<br> - For the time being.<br> To see what you can get<br> out of her?<br> I never went to her.<br> It was she who settled on me.<br> Let's...<br> - Please, let me go.<br> - I thought you liked the rain.<br> I'm drenched, Merton.<br> Please, let me go.<br> - Not until you promise.<br> - No.<br> All right, I give up.<br> - You know my conditions.<br> - I'm not going to marry you.<br> Then we are gonna get<br> very wet together.<br> I promise.<br> - So where's my ring?<br> - Merton.<br> I need proof.<br> Kate, is that you?<br> - Lord Mark has been waiting all afternoon.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I got caught in the rain. I didn't<br> know you were coming, Lord Mark.<br> No, don't worry.<br> It was an impromptu visit.<br> I came to invite you both<br> for lunch tomorrow.<br> - I'm afraid I can't tomorrow.<br> - Why not?<br> - I've arranged to meet a friend.<br> - One of your old friends?<br> Can't you arrange<br> to see her another day?<br> It's too late to cancel.<br> I'll get my driver<br> to send her a note.<br> Where does she live?<br> I'm sure it'll be all right.<br> I don't need to send a note.<br> Yes, hello. I was wondering if<br> Mr Merton Densher was in the office.<br> - Kate?<br> - Do you know when he'll be back?<br> N-N-No. No. That's all right.<br> Thank you. Goodbye.<br> Kate?<br> It's open!<br> You look surprised to see me.<br> Yes. Yes, I am.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I couldn't get away until now.<br> - I have to finish this.<br> - Don't pretend you can concentrate.<br> I don't have any choice. I should've<br> done this when I was waiting for you.<br> - Where were you?<br> - With Maud.<br> - And what did she buy you this time?<br> - Nothing.<br> You should've come with me then, 'cause<br> I could've bought you nothing too.<br> It's much nicer here<br> than I thought it would be.<br> Nice enough to move in?<br> I'd have to see<br> the rest of the house first.<br> What if I didn't<br> let you leave tonight?<br> What would happen?<br> I'd be penniless,<br> cast out of society,<br> and I'd be stuck with you.<br> Good. Well, we'll open<br> a bottle of something,<br> and in the morning,<br> everyone will know about us.<br> - I'm not good at being impulsive.<br> - Well, maybe if you just...<br> fell asleep<br> and I didn't wake you up.<br> - Maybe...<br> - I won't fall asleep.<br> One day,<br> you'll get tired of me.<br> I think it'll be<br> the other way around.<br> No, it won't.<br> Cabbie!<br> Hyde Park, please.<br> Can we go to Olds Street instead?<br> Nice to see ya.<br> So, is this welcome home then?<br> Does your aunt<br> know you're here?<br> That's why I've come to talk to you,<br> Father. I want to leave her.<br> - And go where?<br> - Somewhere else.<br> With someone else?<br> Your journalist?<br> - You'd leave your aunt for him?<br> - Yes.<br> With everything<br> she can do for you?<br> I love him.<br> How long do you think<br> you would last without money?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Of course you do.<br> - How about your mother and me? How long did we last?<br> - I love him.<br> You think I didn't love her?<br> How long...<br> How long did we last<br> before all the money ran out?<br> Took a month for me<br> to begin stealing from her.<br> It was living like this<br> that killed her.<br> Do what Maud says.<br> - She's forbidden me to see you.<br> - Then she's right.<br> There's no limit to what<br> your aunt can do for you.<br> Marry me to someone<br> I don't love?<br> Marry you well.<br> Do you really think<br> you'll see any of that money?<br> I already do.<br> She sends me<br> a few schillings each week.<br> Her driver brings it 'round.<br> Then I'm part of your... bargain?<br> How else do you think<br> I'd survive?<br> Don't look at me like that.<br> We're the same, you and I.<br> And I could've told you about<br> the lawyers and others I had to pay...<br> to keep your father out of jail.<br> Did you tell me about<br> the secret trysts in Hyde Park?<br> Tiny room in Soho?<br> A dirty pub in Fleet Street?<br> - That has nothing to do with you.<br> - Yes, it does.<br> I won't let you make<br> the same mistake as your mother.<br> If you see your friend<br> ever again,<br> I can't be responsible for you.<br> Or your father.<br> Then tell Miss Croy I'm not leaving<br> until she comes down and sees me.<br> - I've already told her.<br> - Then tell her again and again,<br> because I'm not leaving<br> until I talk to her!<br> She doesn't want to see you.<br> It took exactly a week.<br> We left New York on the 14th<br> and arrived in London yesterday.<br> I'm so glad we're here.<br> Milly looks completely transformed.<br> We were originally gonna go straight<br> to Venice, but I told Milly,<br> I can't come to Europe<br> without visiting you.<br> Well, you'll just have to<br> persuade her to stay a little longer.<br> She takes all the decisions.<br> I'm just a companion.<br> You're not very talkative.<br> You haven't given me a chance.<br> Black suits you<br> perfectly tonight.<br> Has anyone<br> ever told you not to stare?<br> - Do you know her well?<br> - I wish I knew her better.<br> Why's everyone<br> so fascinated by her?<br> She'd be the Queen of America<br> if they had one.<br> World's richest orphan.<br> She's worth millions.<br> Then why aren't you<br> sitting next to her?<br> Well, your Aunt Maud<br> wouldn't let me.<br> I finally caught you on your own.<br> Lord Mark's been<br> monopolizing you all evening.<br> Yes, but he's been staring<br> at you the whole time.<br> So have I.<br> I think your aunt's<br> a little drunk.<br> Oh, she's never drunk.<br> That would interfere.<br> - With what?<br> - All the plots she is hatching.<br> - You make her sound like a witch.<br> - Oh, no.<br> She can't fly... yet.<br> Milly!<br> - Psst.<br> - Kate!<br> I saw you from the bus.<br> I thought you were running away from me.<br> No, not at all.<br> I didn't see you.<br> - What are you reading?<br> - Tennyson.<br> Who were you visiting?<br> Just now? Some friends.<br> Milly.<br> Excuse me, is this<br> the foreign language section?<br> Let's see.<br> Well, if I'd have been the owner,<br> I'd have thrown you both out.<br> - But why?<br> - Because that part of the book shop is reserved for men.<br> - Why?<br> - You saw the pictures.<br> Exactly. I saw them. Have I changed?<br> Have I suddenly become corrupt?<br> It's a gradual process.<br> Look at Kate.<br> - There's nothing corrupt about Kate.<br> - Mm, of course there is.<br> It's in her eyes.<br> Can't you see?<br> There's far too much going on<br> behind those pretty lashes.<br> I think we're going to leave you<br> until you've sobered up.<br> He must be in love with you<br> to behave like that.<br> God, I hope not.<br> How do you do, Mr Densher?<br> Do you know who he is?<br> Yes.<br> He's a friend of the family.<br> Where did you find your friend?<br> She was invited. I wasn't.<br> It was one way<br> to get to see you.<br> - Did you get my letters?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why didn't you write?<br> - I didn't see the point.<br> So why have you come now?<br> Did it hurt?<br> Is that what you wanted?<br> I hurt... so much.<br> You can't imagine.<br> It was your choice.<br> Just have to wait.<br> I want you to go back<br> and kiss her... with that mouth.<br> You came with her.<br> I'll come and see you soon.<br> Poor Mark.<br> He invited you<br> to his country house.<br> - He invited you too.<br> - Only to keep you company.<br> He's not my type.<br> No?<br> - What is your type?<br> - That friend of yours at the party.<br> Which friend?<br> The one who came in<br> with the older woman.<br> Merton Densher?<br> He was beautiful.<br> What's your article about?<br> - Hospitals.<br> - What do you care about hospitals?<br> - Oh, I care about a lot of things that you don't know.<br> - For example.<br> For example,<br> there's a doctor at King's.<br> He runs a little surgery<br> on the side for whores.<br> He charges one pound, one schilling<br> for issuing virginity certificates...<br> and two pounds<br> for sewing the ladies up.<br> He operates on 12-year-old girls...<br> and sends them back out on the streets<br> to earn the money to pay him.<br> And he's just been elected<br> to the Royal Society.<br> For example.<br> - Are you censoring it?<br> - I'm editing it for you.<br> - It's very angry.<br> - Well, it's supposed to be.<br> So angry,<br> you've left out a word.<br> - Have you heard of a Sir Luke Strett?<br> - Of course I have.<br> - Why "of course"?<br> - He's a leading blood specialist. A very respected doctor.<br> - Why?<br> - He's a friend of Milly's.<br> - Who's Milly?<br> - Oh, my best friend of the day.<br> - Oh, yes, the American girl.<br> - How did you know she was American?<br> - By her laugh.<br> - You're such a snob. She liked you.<br> That's because<br> she doesn't know me.<br> You're not nearly as bad<br> as you'd like to be.<br> Everything's going to be fine.<br> Wonderful!<br> - Milly?<br> - Kate!<br> I'm here with Merton.<br> - You haven't met Merton properly before, have you?<br> - No.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> I want to show you something.<br> Kate's been talking about you all afternoon.<br> I was almost sure we'd bump into you.<br> It's funny how that happens, isn't it?<br> - I hope she was saying nice things about me.<br> - Oh, yes, very nice things.<br> - You've made quite an impression.<br> - Well, so has she.<br> What are you doing here,<br> the two of you?<br> Looking at paintings.<br> Of course.<br> I was hiding from the rain.<br> Well, I'm sorry<br> to have to leave you,<br> but if I don't go,<br> I'll be late for work.<br> It was a pleasure<br> to meet you. Goodbye.<br> - Well, I hope I didn't scare him away.<br> - Oh, no. No.<br> It's not what you're thinking.<br> - No?<br> - No.<br> He's an old family friend.<br> Oh, damn.<br> Look at my view, Milly.<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> What's your secret, Milly?<br> It's secret.<br> My theory is you can't really live...<br> can't truly live...<br> until you trust someone<br> with your secret.<br> It's a good theory.<br> Yes, it is.<br> I just want to talk to you.<br> I... I want to explain.<br> Mark, you have to go.<br> I need her. That's why... That's why<br> I pay her all the attention.<br> - That's why I ignore you.<br> - You don't ignore me. You're drunk.<br> I love you, Kate. You.<br> I need Milly's money<br> to keep my home.<br> I have to marry her,<br> but it doesn't have to be forever.<br> What are you talking about?<br> She's ill. She's very ill.<br> Everyone in New York knows about it,<br> all my friends there.<br> - And when she's gone...<br> - Get out.<br> Get out right now, or I'll<br> tell her everything you said.<br> - Every word.<br> - I just...<br> I swear, Mark.<br> All right.<br> I just wanted to say how...<br> sorry I am<br> for ignoring you today.<br> It's me.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - It's freezing in my room.<br> Sleep here.<br> What's wrong?<br> What?<br> Nothing.<br> These wretched aristocrats<br> can't even heat their houses.<br> - Good day.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> May I take that?<br> Merton!<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - This is my friend, Susan.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Kate told me she was meeting you here.<br> - No, she was busy today.<br> I must have got the wrong day.<br> Well, she's getting ready<br> for Venice.<br> - Venice?<br> - Yes, she's coming with Susie and me to Venice.<br> - Susie's got to convince Aunt Maud first.<br> - I said I'll try.<br> Today.<br> Will you sit with us?<br> Thank you, but I really must<br> get back to work. Goodbye.<br> Shall I walk you out?<br> - Kate hadn't told you we were going to Venice?<br> - Well, I hadn't seen her.<br> - Are you and Kate old friends?<br> - Is that what she told you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Why don't you come with us?<br> - To Venice.<br> Why not?<br> That's something<br> only a princess would say.<br> And you look down<br> on princesses?<br> Especially princesses.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Where were you?<br> - Here.<br> So why was I there?<br> Couldn't get away.<br> Do you hate me a little more<br> for standing you up?<br> You didn't just stand me up.<br> You set me up.<br> - Did you like her?<br> - No.<br> - Did she like you?<br> - Well, she asked me to come to Venice.<br> - Why don't you?<br> - Why should I?<br> Because I'll be there,<br> and Maud won't.<br> - What about poor old Milly?<br> - Why "poor old Milly"?<br> - She wants to be with you on her own.<br> - She'd rather be with you on her own.<br> Look, I'm not going to Venice.<br> You want to see me,<br> you see me here.<br> - Don't you think she's beautiful?<br> - No.<br> - I won't get jealous.<br> - No, I don't think she's beautiful.<br> I do. I think she's the most<br> beautiful woman I've ever met.<br> Then I'm sure you'll have<br> a good time together in Venice.<br> Susie will be there<br> to look after us.<br> Susie's a glorified maid.<br> The two of you will do as you like.<br> - I had plans for you this summer.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - And if I say no?<br> - I'll still go.<br> No matter what the consequences?<br> I'll have to ask Milly for help.<br> It didn't take you long<br> to find a new patron.<br> - She's a friend.<br> - Call it what you will.<br> You're still for hire.<br> - When will you be back?<br> - That's entirely up to her, isn't it?<br> You'll need something nice<br> to wear around Milly.<br> People might think<br> you're her servant.<br> Yes, I have something<br> for Mr Croy.<br> Look, I know he's here.<br> Please give him this.<br> I'm sure you'll find<br> everything in order.<br> Oh, wait, Eugenio.<br> Let's see it in the dark.<br> - Is this all yours?<br> - It's ours.<br> - Thank you for bringing me here.<br> - Mm, thank you for coming.<br> If you ever get bored,<br> you can invite anyone you want.<br> - Why should I get bored?<br> - If you do.<br> - Who would you like me to invite?<br> - Whoever you like.<br> Shall I ask Merton?<br> I already have. He said no.<br> Do you want me to ask him?<br> Only if you want to.<br> Only if you want to.<br> He's your friend.<br> I hardly know him.<br> All right then.<br> We won't ask him.<br> It's all right, darling.<br> Try to rest, my sweet.<br> That's it. That's it.<br> Merton,<br> what made you change your mind?<br> - Oh, I was always going to come.<br> - No, really.<br> It just took a little time<br> to scrape the money together.<br> This place was recommended<br> by a friend.<br> Well, I thought he was a friend<br> until I arrived here.<br> Well, here it is. Buon giorno.<br> Notice the splendid stucco work,<br> the elegant stone motifs.<br> This stupendous building is a classic<br> example of early Venetian craft...<br> and was used as a model for many<br> of the great European palaces.<br> If you'd like to follow me<br> in an orderly line.<br> - Buon giorno.<br> - Buon giorno.<br> My roommate Giuseppe.<br> This way, ladies.<br> Here we have the legendary<br> baths of the Palazzo Dentia.<br> Surely this was modeled after the great<br> Byzantine steam house in Constantinople.<br> Yes, but many would argue that<br> that miraculous monument...<br> pales against the splendour<br> of this... this later masterpiece.<br> How much are you paying<br> for this, Merton?<br> Three, three, three.<br> - We have to take two boats.<br> - But there's plenty of room. We can all get on.<br> There's no point in trying<br> to speak italian, Merton.<br> I'll take this one,<br> and you and Milly take the other one.<br> Diego's flirting with me.<br> What's your italian like, Milly?<br> I can't see him in the dark.<br> How's Merton?<br> Merton, say something.<br> - You're drunk, aren't you?<br> - Mm, that's not such a bad idea.<br> Milly, tell him<br> I promise to be quiet.<br> - She promises to be quiet.<br> - Tell her it's too late.<br> - It's too late!<br> - Why?<br> Milly. Milly.<br> Closer. Come closer.<br> Kate?<br> Oh, I think I'll wait outside, Milly.<br> I don't like heights.<br> - Susie?<br> - It's a long way up. Are you sure?<br> - Merton, will you come?<br> - I'm not good with heights either.<br> - You should've gone with her.<br> - Why?<br> 'Cause she asked you to.<br> It was rude to say no.<br> - Why do you want me to be with her all the time?<br> - It isn't all the time.<br> Well, last night, for example.<br> - I don't want her to feel left out.<br> - She doesn't care.<br> Of course she does.<br> She's in love with you.<br> She hardly knows me.<br> That doesn't matter.<br> It's the way she is.<br> Are you all right?<br> - It's just so hot. Isn't it hot?<br> - It's not that hot.<br> - It is close.<br> - Do you feel dizzy?<br> That's better.<br> - You all right?<br> - Yes, I... I'm fine.<br> I'm fine. I'm fine. Thank you.<br> There's nothing to worry about.<br> It was just a dizzy spell.<br> - Can we see her?<br> - She's asleep.<br> - We'll see you later.<br> - Good.<br> - You heard what Susan said.<br> - Susan was lying.<br> Why should she lie?<br> Milly's dying.<br> She can't be. She looks fine.<br> - How do you know?<br> - Lord Mark told me.<br> - Why didn't she say anything?<br> - She didn't want us to know.<br> - It doesn't make sense.<br> - It makes perfect sense.<br> She's come here to live,<br> not to die.<br> She doesn't want our pity.<br> What does she want?<br> Your love.<br> How long have you known<br> she was ill?<br> - I wasn't sure until today.<br> - But you knew before?<br> Yes.<br> That's why you wanted me<br> to come to Venice.<br> For her.<br> For her...<br> and for us.<br> For us?<br> We're all she has.<br> This is so exciting.<br> I can't believe we're here.<br> Susan?<br> We go over the bridge.<br> Merton, dance with me.<br> - You don't look yourself today.<br> - Really? How do I look?<br> You look wounded.<br> Your eyes are big and sad.<br> Would you rather<br> be dancing with her?<br> - With Kate?<br> - Unless you've got a soft spot for Susan too.<br> I'm perfectly happy<br> dancing with you.<br> You're a beautiful liar.<br> Well, that looks good.<br> Will you wait for me?<br> - We'll lose them.<br> - Good.<br> Where did they go?<br> They're probably waiting for us<br> back at the fountain.<br> I thought I'd lost you tonight.<br> No.<br> This is the first time<br> I didn't feel sorry for her.<br> She was so happy<br> dancing with you.<br> I'm going to leave you<br> alone with her.<br> What are you talking about?<br> What we were<br> talking about before.<br> Don't look at me like that.<br> You've thought the same things.<br> You want me to seduce<br> a dying girl?<br> And you really think she'll<br> just leave me all her money.<br> - Yes.<br> - Why?<br> Because I know her.<br> I know how she loves.<br> And how do you love?<br> Show me how you love.<br> I don't understand.<br> If you don't understand me,<br> then I don't understand you.<br> We won't find them, darling.<br> They'll come back here.<br> Kate?<br> We looked for you everywhere.<br> - All you had to do was tell me.<br> - Tell you what?<br> Please don't lie to me.<br> What do you want me to say?<br> I want to know if you love him.<br> No.<br> Why did you leave?<br> - Because I had to talk to him alone.<br> - Why?<br> To tell him I didn't love him.<br> Milly, I'm going to go<br> back to London...<br> tomorrow.<br> Because of me?<br> Because of you,<br> because of Merton...<br> and because of me.<br> I'm in your way.<br> Don't be ridiculous.<br> Would you really mind<br> if I left?<br> Yes, I would.<br> Please don't lie to me.<br> I don't want you to hate me.<br> I won't.<br> Yes, you will.<br> If I stay, you will.<br> - Buon giorno.<br> - Buon giorno, signore.<br> Good morning.<br> Is Kate still sleeping?<br> I've just taken Kate<br> to the ferry.<br> I didn't know she was leaving.<br> She decided last night.<br> She asked me to tell you<br> how sorry she was...<br> that she didn't have<br> a chance to say goodbye.<br> I hope you won't<br> be leaving too.<br> No.<br> I like it here.<br> I'll take that back<br> to England with me.<br> - And you know the prow is much heavier than the stern.<br> - Really?<br> If it weren't, the gondolier would be<br> completely off balance and he'd fall in.<br> Well, I would never<br> have thought of that.<br> I'm frighteningly clever,<br> aren't I?<br> Anyway, that's not the prow.<br> That's the stern.<br> No. That's the prow.<br> That's the stern.<br> - That's the prow, and that's the stern.<br> - No.<br> - I think they should demolish the whole place.<br> - How can you say that?<br> It's true.<br> It's a very good idea.<br> - You'd knock down the basilica?<br> - I'd raze the whole of St. Mark's.<br> - You're just arguing for the sake of it.<br> - Not at all!<br> Think of all the wasted space.<br> Thousands of square feet for two cafes<br> and a handful of myopic tourists.<br> - And what would you build instead?<br> - Houses for the poor.<br> Oh, that's completely unfair.<br> That is so unfair!<br> - Why?<br> - Because you're using an emotional argument.<br> - How could I possibly disagree?<br> - Well, don't.<br> - Agree with me and admit you've lost.<br> - Never!<br> - You've lost.<br> - Never.<br> - You've completely lost. You've totally lost.<br> - I have not lost!<br> He didn't say he'd visit.<br> He just said we'd meet.<br> There's no reason<br> why I can't go to him.<br> - You can't go out in this rain.<br> - Why not?<br> What could the rain do to me?<br> Si?<br> I was going to come and see you<br> when the rain stopped.<br> The rain hasn't stopped<br> for three days.<br> Come in.<br> Susie thinks<br> you've been avoiding us.<br> Why would I do that?<br> That's exactly what I said.<br> What have you been doing<br> in your hideaway?<br> Pacing the room.<br> Drawing on the windows.<br> Packing your bags?<br> And unpacking them.<br> Why did you stay? Really.<br> I have nothing to go back to.<br> Your work.<br> Oh, I don't believe in any<br> of the things I write about.<br> I fake passion.<br> I fake conviction.<br> I believe in you.<br> Why?<br> I just do.<br> I have a good feeling.<br> A good feeling?<br> Yes.<br> I think everything's going<br> to happen for you, Merton,<br> sooner than you think.<br> How do you know?<br> With certain people, I know.<br> Are you all right?<br> I was trying to impress you.<br> I'm going to make a fool<br> of myself tonight.<br> I know it.<br> You're drunk, aren't you?<br> Not as drunk as I'm<br> pretending to be.<br> - How are we going to get you home?<br> - We're not.<br> - We're going to get you home first.<br> - Milly.<br> - I'm walking you home.<br> - No, you can't.<br> I can.<br> All right, then.<br> You walk me there,<br> and I'll walk you all the way back.<br> Fine.<br> I know<br> it must be difficult to write...<br> when you're with her<br> all the time,<br> but please try,<br> if only to reassure me.<br> In my head I follow you<br> around the streets and canals.<br> Sometimes I see you touch her,<br> and I'm suddenly scared.<br> This square doesn't<br> look familiar.<br> I'm walking you home.<br> That's the agreement.<br> All right.<br> Are you sure you know the way?<br> Yes.<br> So that must mean that you're<br> taking me the long way around.<br> Why would I do<br> something like that?<br> I dread to think.<br> Milly,<br> is this really a good idea?<br> - And now we go back.<br> - We have to go all the way inside.<br> Milly...<br> I told you I was going to<br> make a fool of myself tonight.<br> I don't want you to.<br> I'll only let you<br> take me home...<br> if you promise<br> to come see me tomorrow.<br> I promise.<br> And the next day.<br> And the day after that.<br> And even if you don't<br> write back,<br> read this letter again<br> and again,<br> and every time<br> she looks at you,<br> and every time she smiles,<br> don't forget I love you more.<br> Where is everyone?<br> - Why isn't anyone working?<br> - Don't be upset.<br> Of course I'm upset. How can they<br> restore it if no one's working?<br> You can always come and see it<br> another time. It won't go away.<br> Milly?<br> Milly?<br> Milly?<br> Milly?<br> My dearest Kate,<br> everything I've done,<br> I've done for you,<br> only it gets harder every day.<br> She's alive, Kate,<br> more alive than anyone<br> I've ever known.<br> My dear Kate. Such a pleasure.<br> What could be so urgent?<br> What is it?<br> The lady's a little fatigued.<br> - Nothing's wrong?<br> - Nothing's wrong.<br> Bye!<br> I want to talk to Miss Theale.<br> She wants to see no one.<br> - Tell her it's me.<br> - She said no one.<br> She's very tired.<br> Has anyone else been to see her?<br> An Englishman?<br> Miss Theale had a visit<br> this morning.<br> Lord Mark?<br> Tell Miss Theale<br> I came to see her.<br> Tell her.<br> Grazie.<br> Basta. Cosi. Grazie.<br> Is she sick?<br> Yes.<br> Is she dying?<br> Did you know?<br> Will she see me?<br> I think so.<br> If she asks you, just say no.<br> Tell her it isn't true.<br> What isn't true?<br> What Lord Mark told her.<br> What did he tell her?<br> That you've been with Kate,<br> all the time.<br> All what time?<br> From the beginning.<br> I saw him in the piazza...<br> at Florian's,<br> through the window.<br> I hardly know him.<br> - Why did he tell her that?<br> - He wanted to marry Milly.<br> He knew she didn't want him.<br> She told him. He knew that.<br> What did he want? Did he want to<br> hurt her? Did he want to kill her?<br> - How did he know about Kate?<br> - Kate must have told him.<br> That can't be true.<br> Who else knew?<br> I was hoping you'd find<br> a way to see me.<br> All you had to do was ask.<br> I couldn't do that.<br> It had to be a little difficult.<br> You look well.<br> Apparently not.<br> You've heard I'm ill?<br> Yes.<br> I went out yesterday morning.<br> I feel better in the mornings.<br> It's such a big city, but I thought<br> I might see you wandering around.<br> I thought the same.<br> Where did you go?<br> San Marco, the Rialto.<br> All the places we went together.<br> Maybe we just kept missing each other... me turning<br> the corner just as you went the other way.<br> I thought of that<br> so I stayed in the same place...<br> and waited for hours.<br> And we still<br> didn't see each other.<br> When will you go<br> back to London?<br> I'm not going anywhere.<br> What will you do here?<br> The same things we did before.<br> Do I look like I can<br> climb a church scaffold?<br> You can do anything you want.<br> Not any more.<br> I can't fool myself forever.<br> It isn't true, Milly,<br> what he told you.<br> - It isn't true.<br> - Look what Mark brought me from London.<br> - Milly, please listen.<br> - Look at the print on the box.<br> It's Ophelia drowning,<br> or someone dying, anyway.<br> - He didn't notice until the last moment.<br> - Milly.<br> You should have seen him.<br> He was so embarrassed.<br> - He kept trying to turn the tin on its side without me noticing.<br> - Milly.<br> He never does anything<br> quite right.<br> He came here to hurt me,<br> and he brought me a box of biscuits.<br> What he told you...<br> it isn't true.<br> I told him that myself,<br> and then I sent him away in the rain.<br> But you believed him.<br> Milly?<br> - What can I do to persuade you?<br> - Don't.<br> We're beyond that, you and I.<br> I love you.<br> Both of you.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I'm so sorry!<br> "My heart is sore pained within me..."<br> "and the terrors of death<br> have fallen upon me."<br> "Fearfulness and trembling<br> have come upon me,"<br> "and horror<br> hath overwhelmed me."<br> "And I said, 'Oh, that I had<br> wings like a dove...<br> "'for then I would fly away...<br> and be at rest."'<br> Merton?<br> You couldn't hear me?<br> I was next door.<br> When did you get back?<br> Fortnight. Fortnight on Friday.<br> Well, I couldn't rush<br> to you, could I?<br> I was keeping<br> to our wonderful system.<br> - She was my friend too, Merton.<br> - Of course she was.<br> Our great friend.<br> - The three of us...<br> - Stop it.<br> Why did you tell Lord Mark?<br> - Tell him what?<br> - About us.<br> You knew he'd go to her.<br> And what about all your plans?<br> I was scared of losing you.<br> This is for you.<br> Open it.<br> - It's addressed to you.<br> - It's from Milly.<br> - Aren't you interested to know what it says?<br> - I know what it says.<br> - She's made you rich.<br> - Take it.<br> It's your prize.<br> Why did you give me the letter?<br> I wanted to see what you'd do.<br> You'll still get her money.<br> Burning a letter<br> doesn't change that.<br> No.<br> I'm going to write<br> to her lawyers.<br> You want me to persuade you<br> to keep her money.<br> Is that what you want?<br> I'll never take her money.<br> I love you, Kate.<br> I love you too.<br> What are you thinking about?<br> You're still in love with her.<br> I was never in love with her.<br> While she was alive, no.<br> I'm sorry, Kate.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> She wanted us to be together.<br> We will be.<br> I'm going to write that letter.<br> Do whatever you want.<br> I want to marry you, Kate,<br> without her money.<br> Is that your condition?<br> Yes.<br> Am I allowed one too?<br> Of course you are.<br> Give me...<br> your word of honour...<br> your word of honour...<br> that you're not in love...<br> with her memory.<br> Milly! Milly!<br> Come closer. Come closer.<br> I believe in you. I just do.<br> I have a good feeling.<br> I think everything's going to happen<br> for you, Merton, sooner than you think.<br> With certain people, I know.<br>
