Listen!<br> Look, it ticks!<br> Read what my medal says,<br> ' Courage' !<br> Ain't it the truth? Ain't it the truth?<br> They're all wonderful,<br> -What about Dorothy?<br> -Yes, how about Dorothy?<br> -Dorothy next!<br> -Yes, Dorothy,<br> I don't think there's anything<br> in that black bag for me,<br> You force me into a cataclysmic decision,<br> The only way to get Dorothy back to<br> Kansas is for me to take her there myself!<br> Will you? Could you?<br> Are you a clever enough wizard<br> to manage it?<br> Child, you cut me to the quick!<br> I'm an old Kansas man myself...<br> ...born and bred in the heart<br> of the western wilderness...<br> ...premier balloonist par excellence...<br> ...for the Miracle Wonderland<br> Carnival Company, Until one day...<br> ...while performing spectacular feats<br> of stratospheric skill...<br> ...never before attempted by civilized man,<br> an unfortunate phenomenon occurred,<br> The balloon failed to return to the fair,<br> It did?<br> Weren't you frightened?<br> Frightened? You are talking to a man<br> who has laughed in the face of death...<br> ...sneered at doom<br> and chuckled at catastrophe,<br> I was petrified.<br> Then suddenly the wind changed<br> and the balloon floated down...<br> ...into the heart of this noble city<br> where I was instantly acclaimed Oz...<br> ...the First Wizard Deluxe!<br> Times being what they were,<br> I accepted the job...<br> ...retaining my balloon against the advent<br> of a quick getaway,<br> And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy,<br> you and I will return...<br> ...to the land of ' e pluribus unum' !<br> This is positively the finest exhibition<br> ever to be shown,<br> Yes, well, be that as it may...<br> ...l, your Wizard per ardua et alta...<br> ...am about to embark upon a hazardous<br> and technically unexplainable journey...<br> ...into the outer stratosphere!<br> To confer, converse and otherwise hobnob<br> with my brother wizards,<br> And I hereby decree that until what time...<br> ...if any, that I return, the Scarecrow...<br> ...by virtue of his highly superior brains,<br> shall rule in my stead...<br> ...assisted by the Tin Man,<br> by virtue of his magnificent heart...<br> ...and the Lion, by virtue of his courage!<br> Obey them as you would me,<br> Thank you.<br> Toto!<br> Come back! Toto!<br> Don't go without me! I'll be right back!<br> Stop that dog!<br> This is highly irregular procedure!<br> This is absolutely unprecedented!<br> Ruined my exit!<br> Come back! Come back!<br> Don't go without me! Please, come back!<br> I can't come back!<br> I don't know how it works!<br> Goodbye, folks!<br> Goodbye!<br> Now I'll never get home!<br> Stay with us then, Dorothy,<br> We all love you,<br> We don't want you to go,<br> That's very kind of you...<br> ...but this could never be like Kansas.<br> Auntie Em must have stopped wondering<br> what happened to me by now,<br> Scarecrow, what am I going to do?<br> Look!<br> Here's someone who can help you!<br> -Will you help me? Can you help me?<br> -You don't need to be helped any longer,<br> You've always had the power<br> to go back to Kansas,<br> I have?<br> Why didn't you tell her before?<br> Because she wouldn't have believed me,<br> She had to learn it for herself,<br> What have you learned, Dorothy?<br> I think that it wasn't enough just to want<br> to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em,<br> And it's that if I ever go looking<br> for my heart's desire again...<br> ...l won't look any further<br> than my own backyard...<br> ...because if it isn't there...<br> ...l never really lost it to begin with,<br> Is that right?<br> That's all it is!<br> But that's so easy!<br> I should have thought of it for you,<br> -I should have felt it in my heart.<br> -No. She had to find it out for herself.<br> Now those magic slippers<br> will take you home in two seconds!<br> -Toto, too?<br> -Toto, too.<br> -Now?<br> -Whenever you wish,<br> Oh, dear, that's too wonderful to be true!<br> It's going to be so hard to say goodbye,<br> I love you all, too,<br> Goodbye, Tin Man,<br> Don't cry.<br> You'll rust so dreadfully,<br> Here. Here's your oilcan.<br> Goodbye,<br> Now I know I've got a heart<br> 'cause it's breaking,<br> Goodbye, Lion,<br> You know, I know it isn't right...<br> ...but I'm gonna miss the way<br> you used to holler for help...<br> ...before you found your courage,<br> I would never have found it<br> if it hadn't been for you.<br> I think I'll miss you most of all.<br> Are you ready now?<br> Yes,<br> Say goodbye, Toto,<br> Yes, I'm ready now,<br> Then close your eyes and tap your heels<br> together three times,<br> And think to yourself:<br> ' There's no place like home,<br> There's no place like home,'<br> There's no place like home,<br> There's no place like home,<br> There's no place like home,<br> There's no place like home,<br> There's no place like home,<br> There's no place like home,<br> There's no place like home,<br> Wake up, honey,<br> There's no place like home,<br> There's no place like home,<br> There's no place....<br> Dorothy! Dorothy, dear,<br> It's Aunt Em, darling,<br> Auntie Em, it's you!<br> Hello, there! Anybody home?<br> I just dropped by because I heard<br> the little girl got caught in the big....<br> Well, she seems all right now!<br> She got quite a bump on the head,<br> We thought for a minute she'd leave us,<br> But I did leave you, Uncle Henry,<br> That's just the trouble,<br> And I tried to get back for days and days,<br> There, there, lie quiet now,<br> You just had a bad dream,<br> Sure,<br> Remember me, your old pal, Hunk?<br> And me, Hickory?<br> You couldn't forget my face, could you?<br> No. But it wasn't a dream. It was a place.<br> And you, and you, and you,<br> and you were there,<br> But you couldn't have been, could you?<br> We dream lots of silly things when we--<br> No, Aunt Em, this was a real,<br> truly live place,<br> And I remember that some of it<br> wasn't very nice...<br> ...but most of it was beautiful.<br> But just the same...<br> ...all I kept saying to everybody was,<br> ' I want to go home! '<br> And they sent me home,<br> Doesn't anybody believe me?<br> Of course we believe you, Dorothy,<br> But anyway, Toto, we're home!<br> Home!<br> And this is my room, and you're all here!<br> And I'm not going to leave here ever,<br> ever again, because I love you all!<br> Auntie Em, there's no place like home!<br>
