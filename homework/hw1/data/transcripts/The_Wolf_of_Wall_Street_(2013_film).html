not to mention<br> countless dollars.<br> It even gets better baby.<br> Because if I decide to cooperate.<br> They only give me 4 years.<br> In this case we can<br> start from scratch.<br> Maybe sell the house.<br> Any fines payable<br> will be after prison.<br> So there will be enough<br> money left over, you know?<br> The only thing that annoyed me<br> this is a bit small<br> thought of having to ...<br> give information<br> about my friends.<br> Like you said, no friends<br> on Wall Street.<br> Right.<br> Exactly, I thought so too fondly because<br> said eventually ...<br> everyone will
