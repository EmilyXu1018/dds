He'll be dead.<br> - You can't be serious!<br> - You bet your fat ass I am!<br> I'm warning you: either tie him up,<br> make him behave...<br> ...or I'll make him dead as a doornail.<br> Come on, Garp.<br> - Good afternoon, Dean Blodger.<br> - Good afternoon, Jenny. Hello there, Garp.<br> Hello, Dean.<br> I understand<br> you'll be starting classes next semester.<br> We're on our way now<br> to enter him in a sport.<br> Really? What will you be going out for?<br> - Basketball.<br> - I don't know.<br> I'm sure you'll do splendidly.<br> Good luck to you!<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Why can't I decide what sport to take?<br> - Because you're too young.<br> I've looked into them all.<br> Basketball is the best.<br> I'm too short for basketball.<br> Garp, you want to play?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - No, you don't.<br> That Cushie could use a good sport herself.<br> - Over here, let's go!<br> - Hit the rebound!<br> Okay, let's get back on defense!<br> Let's go, set up number four!<br> Let's go, Chris.

Nice shot!<br> All right, same thing! Bottom man down!<br> Let's go. Ready?<br> Ten seconds!<br> Hold him!<br> Five!<br> Four! Three! Two!<br> Okay, gentlemen, that's it.<br> Hit the showers.<br> Hey, Garp, how are you doing?<br> Why can't basketball players father a child?<br> Because they're ugly.<br> No, because they dribble<br> before they shoot.<br> - What's the definition of a brassiere?<br> - I don't know, what?<br> It's an over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder.<br> - And what's the definition of a girdle?<br> - I don't know.<br> It's a lower-decker-pecker-checker.<br> My father wore a helmet. He was a flyer.<br> - Can you fly?<br> - No.<br> Garp?<br> - Jesus Christ!<br> - What's she doing here?<br> - Spare me your modesty.<br> - Why can't Santa Claus father a child?<br> Because he comes down a chimney.<br> Garp, what are you doing in here?<br> We've got a big meeting tomorrow,<br> so no beating the meat tonight!<br> - I want to do what they do.<br> - Animals!<br> Garp?<br> Mom!<br> Garp?<br> Mom, help me!<br> Help!

It's all right.<br> Get your mattresses!<br> Something to cushion the fall!<br> I wanted to fly!<br> I understand. It's all right.<br> Now carefully, give me your foot.<br> Get the mattresses close together...<br> ...right next to the building<br> so he can fall on them. Hurry, boys!<br> Give me your free foot.<br> A little bit more over. There we are!<br> I've got you! I'm not going to let go!<br> All right? I'm not going to let go of you.<br> You'll be all right.<br> Quickly.<br> Now, slowly take your foot<br> out of the gutter.<br> That's a good boy. Take it out.<br> I've got you, son, I've got you!<br> Miss Fields.<br> - Yes?<br> - What about Dean Blodger?<br> Bring him in to the infirmary.<br> Let's go, boys. Everybody back inside.<br> Hey, everybody inside.<br> Get the mattresses.<br> You sure like trouble, don't you?<br> Thank God I caught him.<br> Yes, just in time.<br> What was he doing up there?<br> Pretending to be his dead father.<br> I wanted to be a father myself.<br> But I never got married.<br> Neither did I.<br> I always wanted a child.<br> If I could've had one by myself,<br> I would have.<br> But God, or nature, or whatever...<br> Well, you know, you need a man.<br> You know what men are like. Full of lust.<br> I can talk to you 'cause you're past all that.<br> - What?<br> - You're not well enough to walk.<br> It's a very nasty bump.<br> Anyway, the war was on.<br> I was a nurse.<br> One day, they brought in a tail gunner...<br> ...who'd been wounded by antiaircraft<br> in a raid over Germany.<br> A splinter of steel had lodged in his brain<br> and all he could say was his name: Garp.<br> For medical reasons I couldn't understand,<br> he also had a constant erection.<br> He deteriorated steadily.<br> Until one day,<br> all he could say was part of his name: Arp.<br> It was then that I knew<br> that he wouldn't last much longer.<br> His erections continued, however,<br> quite unabated.<br> I see.<br> - I'll just be going.<br> - Not yet.<br> You'd better rest.<br> Anyway.<br> Where was I?<br> He kept having erections.<br> Thank you.<br> He was dying. I wanted a child.<br> It was a good way to have one<br> without the bother of a husband around...<br> ...who had legal rights to my body.<br> So, one night at work...<br> ...when the wounded and maimed<br> were all asleep, I went to him.<br> He was asleep.<br> But his erection was there, as always.<br> I removed my undergarments<br> and climbed on top of him.<br> He woke up then.<br> He said the only word other than his name<br> that I ever heard him utter.<br> He said, "good." It didn't take very long,<br> and that once was all that was needed.<br> You raped him! You raped a dying man!<br> - Are you all right?<br> - No!<br> Yes!<br> I have to get home now.<br> You've been very kind.<br> I've never heard anything...<br> Good night.<br> And then he died.<br> He did die.<br> Really?<br> Really.<br> Will you throw me in the air<br> like you used to?<br> You're too big for that now.<br> Now you don't have a father, either.<br> You know, everybody dies.<br> My parents died. Your father died.<br> Everybody dies.<br> I'm going to die, too. So will you.<br> The thing is, to have a life before we die.<br> It can be a real adventure...<br> ...having a life.<br> Garp! Careful of the undertow!<br> The undertow!<br> Be careful of the undertow!<br> - How do you do?<br> - Hi.<br> Hello, again.<br> Hope I'm not disturbing you,<br> running up and down here.<br> Nope.<br> It's distracting, isn't it?<br> Not to me, it's not.<br> What do you weigh, about 112 or so?<br> Pleased to meet you. 158.<br> On my way to 147.<br> Sorry about that.<br> My name is T.S.

You've no right to write this!<br> If you're going to write about me<br> and my personal life, wait till I'm dead.<br> While I'm alive, the subject belongs to me.<br> I might want to write about myself.<br> - Nothing's happened to me yet, Mom.<br> - Well, too bad.<br> Make up something then. Good night, son.<br> Good night, Mom.<br> - Sleep well.<br> - You too.<br> So, how do you know<br> you're going to be a writer?<br> It's just something you know.<br> What are you going to write about?<br> My life, once I've experienced enough.<br> You'll write, and you'll marry Helen,<br> and she'll read.<br> - Is that what you want?<br> - Maybe.<br> I guess I'd better give you something<br> to write about.<br> It's stuck.<br> - Is this your first time?<br> - No.<br> I thought so.<br> - Where's your thing?<br> - Where's what?<br> - Your thing.<br> - My thing?

I showed you mine.<br> You should show me yours.<br> What do you think this is?<br> "Doctor's Office" with Cushie?<br> - I have an appointment.<br> - With who?<br> Whom.<br> With whom is your appointment, Mother?<br> With him. He's a publisher.<br> He looks like a nice man.<br> I'll let him publish my book.<br> - Let him?<br> - Why not?<br> Bring that along, will you?<br> We can return it.<br> - Come along!<br> - Yes, Mother.<br> "In this dirty minded world<br> you are either somebody's wife...<br> "...or somebody's whore...<br> "...or fast on your way<br> to becoming one or the other."<br> I think so. Don't you?<br> To tell you the truth, I've never given<br> the matter much thought but...<br> Garp! Is that right? Garp?<br> That's right. Garp.<br> You didn't write about me, did you?<br> I wrote about my life. You're a part of it.<br> - But when I wanted to write about your...<br> - My son is also a writer.<br> Short stories.<br> Sexual Suspect/<br> I wanted a job, and I wanted to live alone.<br> That made me a sexual suspect.<br> I wanted a baby, but I didn't want<br> to share my life in order to have one.<br> That also made me a sexual suspect.<br> Oh.<br> - I wanted to express an inner longing...<br> - Well, I'll call you.<br> That wasn't fair.<br> You said I couldn't write about you.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Go away!<br> Well?<br> It's...<br> ...so sad.<br> Really?<br> So sad!<br> That's great. I mean, thank you.<br> It's the saddest story I have ever read!<br> That's wonderful!

Not even once.<br> Some authority she is.<br> It's like listening to a plant<br> describe the motives of a mammal.<br> It's the timing.<br> Timing. I thought writing<br> is supposed to be the writing.<br> In writing, it is writing.<br> In publishing, it's timing.<br> I'm stunned, myself. It upsets people!<br> I don't know about Jenny,<br> but I'm getting hate mail for publishing it.<br> It's dangerous stuff,<br> and dangerous stuff sells.<br> In one way or another...<br> ... we have all been suspect...<br> ... all of our lives.<br> We have been suspect as the weaker sex.<br> When we showed strength, we were<br> suspect as not being weak enough.<br> When we showed intelligence,<br> we were suspect of covering up...<br> ... some defect in our femininity<br> with our brains.<br> Know what really gets my goat?<br> That she wrote about me.<br> I am known<br> as the bastard son of Jenny Fields.<br> Hello, how nice to see you again.<br> How are you doing?<br> - Very well, thank you.<br> - Yeah?<br> Thank you so much for everything.<br> What the hell.

Love, Ruth."<br> - I think you'd better write that.<br> - Thank you. I will.<br> We're neither little nor weak,<br> but a force to be dealt with!<br> The women of America,<br> hungry for a heroine...<br> ... have at last found one in Jenny Fields!<br> The men of America<br> will soon find out what that means.<br> Mom!<br> I'm all right, darling!<br> You don't usually find homes this lovely<br> in this quiet a location.<br> Isn't this nice? Isn't this a beautiful street?<br> And the landscaping.<br> They've done lovely things with the lawn.<br> It's a lovely place.<br> Lovely.<br> Just the ticket for young marrieds.<br> And my firm will even<br> finance the mortgage.<br> My mother's paying for it.<br> She's become a firm these days.<br> What do you think, Helen?<br> Is it a home?<br> It's close to the college<br> where I'll be teaching.<br> And close to the supermarket<br> where I'll be shopping.<br> Just like our house.<br> I work, and my husband putters<br> around the house.<br> My husband doesn't putter.

Don't be a baby.<br> Say "Dada."<br> Hey, you! Wait!<br> Look, this is a residential neighborhood.<br> The residents are mostly kids<br> who can't look out for themselves.<br> So, it's up to us to look out for them.<br> This means that we have to follow<br> the speed limit.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> Stop, you son of a bitch!<br> Every time we come here,<br> there are more people.<br> Boy, they take advantage of her.<br> I wonder who they all are.<br> Moochers, hangers-on.<br> This is what happens when you become<br> rich and famous. That's why I avoided it.<br> Garp?<br> How lovely to see you!<br> You look wonderful.<br> Helen. Hello, dear.<br> Hello, Duncan.<br> How about a hug for Grandma?<br> Say "Grandma."<br> No.<br> Well, come on inside.<br> I'll take you upstairs.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> - Who's that?<br> - Somebody Mother introduced me to.<br> Back to your basic hospital white?<br> Yes.<br> Come on upstairs.<br> I'll show you your rooms.<br> Hi, my name's T.S. Garp.<br> Don't touch me! Don't touch me!<br> - Alice dear, it's all right, darling.<br> - He touched me!<br> - I'm sorry. All I did was touch her.<br> - It's all right.<br> She can't bear<br> to have a man's hand touching her.<br> - Boy, has she got problems.<br> - Yes, she does.<br> It's going to be hard<br> to avoid being touched, isn't it?<br> Yes, it is. That's why she's here.<br> My name's Roberta.<br> I'm Garp.<br> - You're Jenny's son!<br> - Yes, I am.<br> I just finished reading your novel.<br> I think it's wonderful.<br> I adored it.<br> - What happened?<br> - It's all right.<br> Garp just frightened Alice for a bit,<br> but she's fine.<br> I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.<br> It was cut off on purpose.<br> Because of what happened<br> to a little girl named Ellen James.<br> Two men raped her<br> when she was 11 years old.<br> They cut off her tongue<br> so she wouldn't tell...<br> ...who they were or what they looked like.<br> Some of these women formed a society<br> in her honor.<br> You mean, this Ellen James Society<br> doesn't speak, as if they had no tongues?<br> No, I mean they don't have any tongues.<br> The women in the Society<br> have their tongues cut off.<br> To protest what happened to Ellen James.<br> You mean, they actually<br> have their own tongues cut off?<br> - Yes. The society...<br> - Mom, I don't want to hear about this shit!<br> You're a little short on sympathy.<br> I've got a lot of sympathy<br> for a girl who gets raped.<br> But God, this is self-mutilation!<br> Suppose the next time there's a rape, I cut<br> off my prick and wear it around my neck.<br> I got a good idea, too.<br> Why not cut off your tits?<br> That way your armor will fit!<br> - It's all right.<br> - Jesus Christ!<br> No sense making things any worse<br> than they are.<br> - This whole house is full of...<br> - I know.<br> Everyone here has something missing<br> or some wound that won't heal.<br> And your mother tries to nurse them<br> back to health.<br> She's a wonderful person.<br> - Are you visiting somebody here?<br> - No, why?<br> You just seem like<br> the only normal person around the place.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Pardon me.<br> I hate to use a corny line like this,<br> but haven't I seen you before?<br> - You like football?<br> - I used to watch it quite a bit.<br> You might have seen me.<br> I was a tight end<br> with the Philadelphia Eagles.<br> Number 90?

Is that his name?<br> - Yes.<br> It sounds like a flavor<br> in a gay ice cream parlor.<br> Strawberry Swirl, Chock-full of Chocolate,<br> Mocha Madness, Michael Milton.<br> He's not gay.<br> His writing is nowhere near<br> as good as yours.<br> - Does he write sad stuff, too?<br> - Hardly.<br> He's one of my gradual students.<br> He's bright enough, he's just...<br> What?<br> I don't know.<br> Young, maybe.<br> He's just young.<br> Very bright, but young.<br> How young? 17?<br> No, not 17.<br> - Is he a teen?<br> - I don't know.<br> Let's go look at the kids.<br> We looked at them last night.<br> I know.<br> But I really feel a need to look at them.<br> For both of us to look at them.<br> All right.<br> Let's go look at the kids.<br> I just really love it.<br> What?<br> Being a father.<br> Being a husband and a father.<br> Oh, I really adore it.<br> I will never ever write anything that lovely.<br> I have talent as a writer...<br> ...but I'm a natural at only two things:<br> Wrestling...<br> ...and being a family man.<br> Come on, family man.<br> Help! Help!<br> They're coming!<br> Kill them. Kill them.<br> You're wounded. As soon as<br> you're wounded, you become a villain.<br> - That's the rules.<br> - I'll become the villain.<br> - You're a disgrace to your tribe.<br> - And the scum of the earth.<br> It's time to die, Sir Scum.<br> I'm going to revenge my uncle's death.<br> You and who else?<br> Me and him. Ready, Sir Walt?<br> Ready, roger and out, Sir Duncan.<br> Sound the charge.<br> Got you.<br> What's the matter, Walt?<br> What's wrong?<br> You guys always get to die. I never get to.<br> You can't. Someone has to rescue<br> the fair maiden.<br> - I want to die, too.<br> - All right.<br> With his last dying breath,<br> Sir Scum manages to crawl forth...<br> ...and fling his vile blade.<br> Sorry about that.<br> We have to end the war<br> because of a pot roast. Isn't that a pity?<br> Don't moan, if you want to eat dinner.<br> - Dead men don't eat.<br> - Dead men don't bitch, either.<br> I've got to go. It's late. Goodbye, darlings.<br> Sure you can't stay?<br> No, I have to go and have a heartbreak<br> in Manhattan.<br> He's young, he's handsome...<br> What can I do?<br> Maybe this time it'll work out.<br> Maybe so. I'm a hopeless romantic<br> in a male chauvinist world.<br> 'Bye, darlings!<br> - Having some trouble?<br> - Looks that way.<br> Can I give you a lift someplace?<br> Where to?<br> Is your apartment clean?<br> Pretty clean.<br> If anyone finds out about this, it's over.<br> Do you understand?<br> - It's a small town.<br> - It's not that small a town.<br> You've been sleeping<br> with Marge Tallworth.<br> She's in Dirckson's<br> Drama through the Ages.<br> That's how small this town is.<br> You've been doing your homework,<br> teacher.<br> I like you calling me "teacher."<br> It underlines the difference in our ages...<br> ...and reminds me why I'm doing this.<br> So, you can keep it up.<br> Not here.<br> Only in your apartment.<br> And only if it's clean.<br> It was just one of those days, Helen.<br> I saw the kids get up.<br> I saw them go to school.<br> I saw you go to work.<br> The kids and I played a great game<br> with Roberta.<br> Ta-ranta-ra!<br> - We beat him, Mom.<br> - We did. We killed him!<br> Oh, boy, did they?<br> Then we talked about the fact that<br> I have never written a Christmas story.<br> - It was my idea.<br> - It was. Story credit goes to Duncan.<br> It's going to be called:<br> A Child's Christmas with a Whale<br> It's about this little lame girl...<br> ...who runs across a beached blue whale,<br> still alive, and she helps him.<br> And I get to do the drawings.<br> Walt gets to do the illustrations.<br> Do you realize how good he is?<br> This is going to be a real family project.<br> Sometimes you can have<br> a whole lifetime in a day...<br> ...and never even notice<br> that this is as beautiful as life gets.<br> I just feel happy that I noticed.<br> I had a beautiful life today.<br> I even died and lived to tell about it.<br> What a day!<br> What a day!<br> Down. Set. Hut. Hut.<br> - You got it.<br> - No fair. No tackling.<br> Oh, Walt, isn't this lovely? Look at him.<br> What's he saying?<br> Boo-hoo.<br> - Did you really do them yourself?<br> - Yes.<br> Duncan did the eyebrows on the whale,<br> but I did the rest.<br> Your daddy used to draw.<br> Not as well as you.<br> Down. Set. Hut. Hut.<br> Get him, Helen. Keep tight with him.<br> Oh. Hey. Hey.<br> Sorry.<br> Garp.<br> Come on, Dad! Let's go!<br> Garp.<br> - How old are you, Granny?<br> - Old as the hills.<br> Really?<br> That's right.<br> You'll be old, too, someday.<br> "Old Man Walt."<br> It's not bad, being old.<br> It's kind of nice, actually.<br> You can have cake and ice cream,<br> and you don't have to worry about cavities.<br> You're done with school.<br> And if you're very lucky,<br> you'll have many, many friends...<br> ...and many, many memories.<br> And you can think about them.<br> Would you like that?<br> Can I go swimming?<br> Of course you can, darling.<br> Just don't go in over your knees.<br> Okay, Duncan. Come on. Come on.<br> Time out. Time out. Just five.<br> What was that all about?<br> A new constitution?<br> They had a crisis.<br> Ellen James wrote them a letter<br> begging them to disband.<br> And stop getting other women<br> to hurt themselves.<br> Good for her!<br> They took a vote and decided to continue.<br> They'll have an Ellen James Society,<br> and Ellen James is against it?<br> It's their right to do what they want.<br> She sent me a picture of herself.<br> - So this is the little girl.<br> - She's not little anymore.<br> She doesn't want anyone to know<br> what she looks like now, or where she is.<br> There still are men who would hurt her.<br> Poor kid. She not only has to hide,<br> but she's got to feel responsible...<br> ...for women whacking their tongues off<br> in her name.<br> I'd help her if I knew how<br> or even where she is, but I can't find out.<br> - Can I have it?<br> - What?<br> - The picture.<br> - Why?<br> Don't know.<br> Walt!<br> Watch out for the undertow!<br> Be careful of the undertow!<br> How's your fellow in New York<br> working out?<br> It isn't. He says I make him feel<br> sexually ambiguous.<br> Can you imagine?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm going on a cruise next Friday,<br> for two weeks. The Club Med.<br> Maybe things will change.<br> Oh, God.<br> Some of my hate mail.<br> This one hopes that I'll get gang banged<br> by the Oakland Raiders.<br> There are a lot of sick people out there.<br> Your mother gets even worse than these.<br> You writing anything?<br> No.<br> If I could write, I'd feel better. Maybe.<br> What's the matter, Roberta?<br> I don't know.<br> I think I'm developing female intuition.<br> I don't know. It's probably nothing.<br> - You coming?<br> - In a minute.<br> Toad? What toad?<br> - I'm almost sorry we're going back.<br> - Home is home.<br> - Undertoad.<br> - There's no toad under the water.<br> Boy, you are something, Walt.<br> - Did you hear that, Dad?<br> - What's that?<br> Walt thinks there's a big toad<br> under the water.<br> You know, undertoad.<br> First there was the gradual student,<br> and now the undertoad.<br> - Come on, Walt's a fine kid.<br> - I know. He just can't talk.<br> Can I help you?<br> What is it?<br> God, you're one of them. Listen.<br> You've got the wrong house,<br> and the wrong guy. My name is Garp.<br> It's my mother you want.<br> I know all about it. I think<br> it's a hideous thing that you've done.<br> I didn't know you knew.<br> You can talk.<br> Why can't basketball players have kids?<br> - Because they're guys.<br> - Daddy's a guy.<br> But Daddy has Mommy.<br> If Daddy had Mommy,<br> but he was a basketball player...<br> ...why couldn't he have kids?<br> But he's a Daddy, and she's a Mommy.<br> That means they do have kids, right?<br> You're so dumb. It's a joke.<br> You didn't say it was a joke.<br> - Where's your handkerchief?<br> - I don't have one.<br> Here. Take mine.<br> - How come we're eating out?<br> - Because it's fun!<br> Hear that, Walt? We're having fun.<br> What's Mom going to eat<br> when she comes home?<br> Shut up and eat!<br> This sure is fun, Dad!<br> Garp?<br> Duncan!<br> Walt!<br> Oh, God.<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Helen.<br> iWhere are you?<br> - What the hell do you care where we are?<br> You call him, Helen.<br> And you tell that wimp...<br> i... it's all over.<br> - Of course I will.<br> You call him, and you say:<br> "Good-bye." On the phone.<br> No last fucks for the road. On the phone!<br> Come home.<br> I feel horrible without all of you here.<br> Walt had a cold this morning.<br> He should be home.<br> Home! What home?<br> We're going to go to a movie.<br> I just can't see you right now.<br> Will you cut that shit out?<br> We'll be home later,<br> if we come home at all.<br> The word '"home'"keeps coming up,<br> but it doesn't sound the same anymore.<br> Get in the goddamn back. Get in there!<br> - Oh, Michael, damn it, will you listen?<br> iYou can't, Helen. You just can't.<br> iNot like this.<br> - I said, it's over.<br> I've got to see you one more time.<br> I'm coming over. I'll be right there.<br> You can't! Michael!<br> - I don't feel like a movie.<br> - Me neither.<br> Too bad, let's go.<br> - Guess what?<br> - What?<br> I think we're still having fun.<br> - I've got to see you, Helen!<br> - You must go. You can't come in.<br> Then get in the car with me.<br> - No, Michael, please!<br> - I brought some champagne.<br> - Just for a minute.<br> - We're not going anywhere!<br> I know.<br> I just want to sit and talk with you.<br> Give me the keys.<br> Give me your car keys and I'll get in<br> the car for a minute, but then you must go.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Let's go.<br> - The movie's not finished yet.<br> - It's finished when I say it's finished.<br> It's real macho time!<br> - Stop quoting Roberta.<br> - I'm quoting Granny.<br> - He is, he's quoting Granny.<br> - I don't care. Come on.<br> Go fuck yourself!<br> There. I've had two glasses of champagne.<br> You have to leave now!<br> I can't. I just can't.<br> I told you, the minute anyone found out<br> about this, it was over.<br> But you're all I've got.<br> I broke up with Marge.<br> You broke up with Marge too late.<br> Be a man, Michael.<br> You started it. Now be a man and leave!<br> It's like being underwater.<br> Yeah, and you know who lives underwater.<br> The terrible, the ugly, undertoad!<br> If we could have just one more time...<br> - Michael!<br> - We wouldn't have to leave the car.<br> Oh, my God. Is that what you want?<br> I always wanted you to.<br> Oh, God!<br> Please?<br> If I do it, will you leave then?<br> - Do you promise?<br> - Yes.<br> - Promise?<br> - I promise.<br> Make it fly, Dad. We want to fly.<br> It's like a dream.<br> You got a nice tan.<br> That's all I got.<br> I came as soon as I could after your letter.<br> The cruise was a disaster, anyway.<br> I'm glad you're here.<br> How are they?<br> We need you here.<br> There's a lot of healing yet to be done.<br> Are you okay?<br> It was fine.<br> No, it wasn't. It was a bore.<br> I missed you all,<br> and I couldn't wait to get back.<br> Come on in. I'll take you up to your room.<br> The doctor says he'll be fine...<br> ...once they take the stitches out<br> of his tongue and unwire his jaw.<br> At least he's better off than...<br> - What was his name?<br> - Michael Milton.<br> Yes, Milton.<br> I mean, I had mine removed surgically<br> under general anesthesia.<br> But to have it bitten off...<br> It's a nightmare.<br> It's lust.<br> What the hell's the matter with you?<br> You think you're the only one around here<br> with a broken heart?<br> Is that what you think?<br> Well, you're not.<br> Look around you!<br> This house is full of them!<br> And mine is one!<br> Laurel!<br> Now, hold on to it.<br> - Got it?<br> - Yeah, I got it. You can let go now.<br> The more the wind blows,<br> the more you can let out.<br> Hey, you! Dildo!<br> Is this the nuthouse<br> where you're keeping my Laurel?<br> - Stay right here.<br> - Okay.<br> Laurel is here...<br> ...but we're not exactly "keeping her."<br> - Bullshit, you big dyke!<br> - I am not a dyke. Is Laurel expecting you?<br> - Fuck you, you douche bag.<br> - That's all you men understand, is violence.<br> I know what sort of creeps<br> hang around here.<br> It's a big lesbian scene!<br> What are you?<br> The man of the house,<br> or the court eunuch?<br> Laurel! You in there, you bitch?<br> Hello.<br> I know who you are.<br> - My Laurel's not your type, sweetie.<br> - Perhaps she's not your type, either.<br> Listen, goddamn it! If you don't get<br> Laurel's ass out here, I'm going to...<br> Randy!<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Baby, you found me.<br> I don't think I can drive the fucking car.<br> That's all right, I can drive.<br> You just never let me.<br> I guess Randy needs me.<br> - Easy!<br> - Sorry, baby.<br> Crazy dyke blindsided me.<br> I'll tell you honestly, son.<br> I think you've been behaving very badly.<br> I've been watching you,<br> and I've been talking to Helen.<br> What happened happened.<br> Your blaming her<br> isn't going to change that.<br> She's hurt, and you're hurt.<br> And you just keep pouring salt<br> on the wounds.<br> That's no way<br> for the son of a nurse to behave.<br> Heal yourself, damn it!<br> And help her heal herself,<br> before it's too late for both of you.<br> Come in.<br> Did you see the doctor?<br> Did he take out the stitches?<br> Can you speak?<br> I miss you.<br> I miss you, too.<br> I really miss you.<br> Me, too.<br> I miss Walt!<br> Me, too.<br> I want another child, Garp.<br> - You do?<br> - Yes. Don't you?<br> Of course!<br> As soon as possible!<br> I'm so, so sorry!<br> No, I'm sorry.<br> - No, I'm so...<br> - Oh, no. I'm sorry.<br> You can order a nice glass eye<br> for any occasion.<br> Is that really true?<br> Yes. For Valentine's Day,<br> you can have one with a heart.<br> A flag for the Fourth of July.<br> - A turkey for Thanksgiving?<br> - Lf you insist.<br> I know what I want.<br> For Christmas, I want a glass eye<br> like one of those crystal balls they have...<br> ...with snow inside of them.<br> I tip my head back like this,<br> and then like this...<br> ...and then there's snow falling in my eye.<br> That sounds wonderful.<br> Listen.<br> Is Daddy writing again?<br> Oh, Duncan!<br> I see a man with one leg.<br> I wish you'd reconsider.<br> I want it published.<br> People used her. They took her life away.<br> - You're using her, too.<br> - I'm just helping her state her case.<br> Maybe, but you also want to get<br> at the Ellen Jamesians.<br> You want to hurt them.<br> No, I don't. I just want them to stop<br> what they're doing. Ellen wants that, too.<br> - Have you talked with her about it?<br> - No, I couldn't find her.<br> I don't know where she is.<br> You have a fine reputation as a writer<br> of serious fiction. This is serious stuff.<br> But it is not fiction.<br> It's a long, merciless attack.<br> You're a publisher, John, not a critic.<br> You just publish it.<br> I see a man with one arm!<br> As a friend, I'm warning you:<br> you'll be sorry you ever wrote this.<br> I'll take that chance. Just publish it!<br> He's got a dog with him.<br> At least change the title.<br> I want it Ellen.<br> t Ellen, and that's<br> 'Bye, Uncle John.<br> Goodbye, Duncan.<br> Garp? Garp!<br> Is it all over?<br> Yes.<br> Is it all right?<br> It's not an "it." It's a "she."<br> And she's all right.<br> She's just a quiet little girl.<br> She's got the hiccups.<br> - How's Helen?<br> - She's fine.<br> She wants to name her Jenny.<br> That's a beautiful name.<br> Yes, it's about time we had another one.<br> I've been Jenny long enough.<br> Come here.<br> Say hi to your baby sister.<br> Hello.<br> Say "Duncan."<br> Can I go in?<br> Can't you stay a couple more days?<br> No, I've got to go.<br> I've delayed the campaign long enough.<br> I wanted to be here to deliver the baby.<br> Now, it's done.<br> We need a granny around the house.<br> Well, I don't want to be<br> the granny around the house.<br> - I don't see what you see in politics.<br> - A mess, that's what. And I don't like it.<br> So I'm trying to clean it up a bit.<br> The woman I'm supporting<br> would make a damn fine president...<br> ...and she's only running for governor.<br> Goodbye, darling.<br> I did a fine thing, son, having you.<br> I'm kind of glad you did too, Mom.<br> I never needed a father!<br> Ever since I began running for governor<br> of New Hampshire...<br> ... l've been the one<br> who gets introduced at these rallies.<br> With the election day so close...<br> ... I want to reverse that,<br> so that win or lose...<br> ... l'll be able to say later on:<br> '"That was the year I got to introduce...<br> '"...Jenny Fields! '"<br> I am Jenny Fields and...<br> It seems that most of you know who I am.<br> I only wish that...<br> Help me get her into the car!<br> Hello?<br> Yes. Yes, it is.<br> Oh, God!<br> Yes.<br> Yes, he is. I'll get him.<br> Garp?<br> Oh, Garp.<br> I tried to look after her. I did.<br> I kept warning her<br> to stay away from crowds.<br> It's hard to protect her in a crowd.<br> I hated crowds.<br> I kept warning her. I did.<br> If I'd seen the man with the gun...<br> If I'd only seen him a second,<br> just a split second sooner...<br> ...I could have blocked the shot.<br> I would have done it.<br> - I know.<br> - I loved her so.<br> She scared the hell out of me once,<br> but I thought she was a fine woman.<br> I saved her boy's life.<br> - Really?<br> - Yep.<br> Caught him when he fell off the roof.<br> Just plain caught him.<br> Death's like that.<br> It just plain catches you.<br> How's the basketball team, coach?<br> - I'm a wrestling coach.<br> - Changed jobs, eh?<br> No, I'm retiring.<br> Don't say that.<br> You've got a long life ahead.<br> No, this is the last year<br> that I'll be coaching.<br> I'm off to Florida.<br> Garp wants to take over.<br> Take over what?<br> Coaching.<br> What do you coach?<br> It's going to be held<br> at 5:00 tomorrow in New York.<br> But I'm afraid you can't go.<br> What do you mean, I can't go? I'm her son.<br> It's just for women.<br> You see, it's going to be<br> the first feminist memorial funeral.<br> And they aren't going to allow any men.<br> A man killed her. They're very upset.<br> I'm upset! She's my mother.<br> I warned you about your book, Garp.<br> The Ellen Jamesians are sending<br> threatening letters to me.<br> Me, too. So what?<br> - There's been enough violence.<br> - They're furious at you.<br> I know these women. If a man shows up...<br> - A man is showing up.<br> - You just want to make trouble.<br> No, I don't.<br> I'll tell you what I want.<br> I want my mother alive again.<br> But since I can't have that,<br> and since I miss her terribly...<br> ...I want to be around as many people<br> as possible who feel the same way as I do.<br> I'm going to mourn her death alone<br> for the rest of my life.<br> But right now, I want to share it<br> with as many people as I can.<br> There was a voice in the land.<br> But now that voice has been silenced...<br> ...by a madman's bullet.<br> Jenny's voice has been silenced.<br> But her words have been passed on<br> to each one of us.<br> And we now can speak for ourselves.<br> Because she taught us how.<br> I grieve, not because I'm afraid<br> that we won't be able to continue.<br> We will continue.<br> I grieve because I loved her.<br> Because we all loved her.<br> She was our mother.<br> And therefore, we are now orphans.<br> She was our home,<br> and now we are homeless.<br> Arp!<br> - I had more to say, but l...<br> - Arp!<br> Pooh!<br> Everyone, please sit down.<br> Silence, please!<br> Silence in the house!<br> I know, that's my book. I really don't...<br> You're an Ellen Jamesian. Thank...<br> You're Ellen James?<br> I just want to talk to you. Wait...<br> You're not taking Donaldson's class.<br> That's a real bore.<br> What shall I take?<br> I'm not sure.<br> What the hell is<br> "Global Development Studies"?<br> I'll have to sit in on that one<br> and let you know.<br> That must be the babysitter. I'll get it.<br> - Hi, Mrs. Garp.<br> - Hi, Jimmy. Come on in.<br> Hi, Jenny.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Jim.<br> The movie should be over by 10:30,<br> so we'll be home by 11:00.<br> I left the number of the theater<br> by the phone in case you have any trouble.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - 'Bye.<br> 'Bye, Mom. 'Bye, Dad.<br> That's a babysitter?<br> I thought we were going to the movies.<br> Where are we going?<br> I see.<br> We're going to stay here<br> and look at the kids.<br> This is some date.<br> Do you miss writing?<br> Not at all. If I do, I'll start again.<br> You know what I really love, though?<br> Thinking about everything.<br> How we met.<br> All that.<br> - You can't live in the past.<br> - I'm not.<br> But I can live in the present,<br> and think about the past.<br> You're supposed to do that<br> when you're old and gray.<br> To hell with that.<br> When I'm old and gray,<br> I probably won't remember my past.<br> You've got to be young when you do it.<br> It's really nice, you know?<br> To look back and see the arc of your life.<br> It's all connected.<br> How you got from there to here...<br> To see the line, you know?<br> It really has been an adventure.<br> I'm going to start teaching again.<br> I'm going to take up hang-gliding.<br> This is what you had in mind all along.<br> And I bet I know what we can do later on.<br> We'll go look at the kids<br> when they're asleep.<br> Helen Holm.<br> Go!<br> Go, Martin. Come on!<br> Take him down!<br> That's it. Good move!<br> Ten seconds!<br> Come on, Martin. Ride him!<br> Come on, Elmer.<br> Same man, the bottom.<br> Get off your back, Virgil.<br> Tie him up underneath. That's it.<br> Ten seconds!<br> Behind him, Marcus!<br> Five seconds!<br> Behind him. Bring him down!<br> Pooh!<br> Get someone! Quickly! Get a doctor!<br> Get an ambulance!<br> Oh, God, please!<br> We're taking you to a hospital in Boston.<br> Everything will be fine.<br> Helen?<br> Remember.<br> What, my love?<br> Everything, Helen.<br> Yes, my love.<br> I'm flying, Helen.<br> Yes, my love.<br> I'm flying.<br> Ta-ranta-ranta-ra.<br>
