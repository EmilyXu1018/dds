                        June 25, 1965.<br> Dossier H-10: Hamilton, Guz.<br> Born 1936,<br> under the sign of Capricorn.<br> Occupation: Journalist with the<br> Australian Broadcasting Service.<br> Jakarta. First assignment<br> as foreign correspondent.<br> You're an enemy here, Hamilton,<br> like all Westerners.<br> President Sukarno<br> tells the West to go to hell...<br> and today Sukarno<br> is the voice of the Third World.<br> - Where you get visa?<br> - Sydney.<br> Something wrong with that?<br> Mr. Hamilton? Mr. Hamilton?<br> - Welcome to Indonesia.<br> - Thanks. You're...<br> Kumar, from Jakarta office.<br> Hortono. Driver.<br> - Where's Potter?<br> - Mr. Potter has gone. He left this.<br> Where's he gone?<br> Back to Australia.<br> Please follow me.<br> He was supposed to stay<br> and brief me.<br> He said he was sorry.<br> His wife was sick.<br> Of what? Him?<br> No, of Jakarta, boss.<br> Our first air-conditioned hotel.<br> Here, Americans and Europeans<br> pay to be kept cold.<br> Who's this?<br> CIA.<br> Nah, he's an embassy office boy.<br> Look at him.<br> You're both wrong.<br> He's the new A.B.S. Man.<br> How did our diminutive friend<br> know that?<br> That little twerp knows everything.<br> Guy Hamilton, right?<br> - Right.<br> - Billy Kwan.<br> I did a lot of film work<br> for Potter.<br> How do you do?<br> I felt sorry for you.<br> Dumped in your first posting<br> without contacts.<br> Adrift, hoping to<br> bluff your way through.<br> Wally O'Sullivan, Sydney Herald.<br> - Read your stuff.<br> - Mere trifles, dear boy.<br> Kevin Condon,<br> photo journo for Theta.<br> - And Pete Curtis, Washington Post.<br> - Hi.<br> - Pleasant flight?<br> - Yeah, it was all right.<br> - This your first overseas post?<br> - Yes, it is. Yeah.<br> Pity about Potter takin' off.<br> Can be hard here without contacts.<br> I'll survive.<br> - Taxi, sir?<br> - No, thanks.<br> You should take a taxi.<br> It's dangerous walking there.<br> - Taxi, sir?<br> - No.<br> Most of us become children again<br> when we enter the slums of Asia.<br> Last night I watched you<br> walk back into childhood...<br> in all its opposite intensities...<br> laughter and misery,<br> the crazy and the grim...<br> toy town and a city of fear.<br> Hey, English, huh?<br> Hey, capitalist.<br> Is it always like that here?<br> Don't take it personally.<br> You're just a symbol of the West.<br> Feel more like a spittoon.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - This is a little market for the poor.<br> "And the people asked Him, saying,<br> 'What shall we do then?"'<br> - What's that?<br> - It's from Luke.<br> Chapter 3, verse 10.<br> "What then must we do?"<br> Tolstoy asked the same question.<br> He wrote a book with that title.<br> He got so upset<br> about the poverty in Moscow...<br> that he went one night<br> into the poorest section...<br> and just gave away<br> all his money.<br> You could do that now.<br> Five American dollars would be a fortune<br> to one of these people.<br> Wouldn't do any good.<br> Just be a drop in the ocean.<br> Ah. That's the same conclusion<br> Tolstoy came to.<br> - I disagree.<br> - What's your solution?<br> Well, I support the view that you just<br> don't think about the major issues.<br> You do whatever you can about<br> the misery that's in front of you.<br> Add your light<br> to the sum of light.<br> - You think that's naive?<br> - Yup.<br> - It's all right. Most journalists do.<br> - We can't afford to get involved.<br> Typical journo's answer.<br> Good luck for tomorrow.<br> You'll need it.<br> Go home. Get some sleep.<br> Take the one behind me.<br> You're ambitious, self-contained...<br> moderate to conservative in politics,<br> and despite your naiivet...<br> I sense a potential,<br> something immediately apparent.<br> A possibility.<br> Could you be the unmet friend?<br> Boss, take off your sunglasses<br> when you go in.<br> Palace guards say they can<br> tell assassin by his eyes.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> Missed anything?<br> Yeah, 63 minutes<br> of excruciating boredom.<br> I got a feeling he's gonna make<br> a pronouncement this morning.<br> Oh, really, Kevin?<br> What makes you say that?<br> - Just a thought.<br> - Yeah?<br> When a thought crosses your mind, it's<br> been on the shortest trip in Jakarta.<br> What happens next?<br> Soon as Sukarno's finished breakfast,<br> we go up.<br> - How do you know when he's finished?<br> - He throws his scraps to us.<br> Sorry, chaps.<br> Age before beauty.<br> One, two, three.<br> Testing, testing.<br> It'll do his image a world of good.<br> The president will act...<br> - Of course I will...<br> - General?<br> No, not now.<br> Just come up here for a minute.<br> Are you gonna leave the U.N. Or not?<br> Korea respect Sukarno.<br> Not like...<br> Let me put it this way. If you<br> don't leave, what are you gonna do?<br> Can I come to your place?<br> If you leave the U.N.,<br> what are you gonna do?<br> In short, Jakarta is a city where<br> the questions outnumber the answers...<br> but one thing is certain:<br> That Sukarno's tightrope shuffle<br> between the Communist P.K. I...<br> and the right-wing military...<br> is looking more precarious<br> as the hours tick by.<br> This is Guy Hamilton<br> in Jakarta for A.B.S. News.<br> - Is that all?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - You could have written that from here.<br> - What about the tightrope image?<br> Everyone else thinks Sukarno<br> is in control.<br> Guy, that wasn't news.<br> It was travelogue.<br> Sydney out.<br> - Didn't like it, eh, boss?<br> - Stop callin' me boss.<br> Sorry.<br> Have one of these.<br> - Why are you creepin' around?<br> - I'm sorry. I didn't hear you come in.<br> - Geez.<br> - I keep equipment here.<br> Potter gave me a key.<br> Do you want it back?<br> Huh! Keep it.<br> - Did you get an interview today?<br> - What?<br> - Did you get an interview?<br> - No, I didn't.<br> You're in trouble.<br> Do you realize that?<br> It's early days yet.<br> All the top doors are shut<br> to Western journalists.<br> - Curtis got an interview.<br> - Curtis and Wally have got reputations.<br> They can't be ignored.<br> Your only way in is personal contacts.<br> Potter sabotaged you.<br> You want me to shoot myself?<br> Ten years I've waited for this,<br> and if I mess it up...<br> they'll send me back to the news room<br> in Sydney, and that's a graveyard.<br> If you could get<br> any interview you want...<br> excluding one with Sukarno,<br> who would it be?<br> - The leader of the Communist Party.<br> - I'll get it.<br> I can get you to him tomorrow.<br> - He doesn't give interviews.<br> - He does when he needs to.<br> He's a friend of mine.<br> I've already spoken to him about you.<br> - Why are you on speaking terms with...<br> - lf you want it...<br> it's yours.<br> It should make quite a stir<br> internationally.<br> If you can get me to Aidit, I'll give<br> you all the film work you can handle.<br> Exclusive.<br> That's great, old man. That's what<br> I've always wanted, a real partnership.<br> Why the break to me?<br> Why not Potter?<br> I didn't like him.<br> We'll make a great team.<br> You, for the words;<br> me, for the pictures.<br> I can be your eyes.<br> - Thank you very much, Mr. Aidit.<br> - Let's go, Guy!<br> We'll keep in touch!<br> I'll take this straight<br> to the airport.<br> - You'll be rushing to catch the flight.<br> - I'll make it.<br> If you shot that out of focus,<br> I'll kill you.<br> You worry about the words,<br> Hamilton.<br> Identification: Guy Hamilton<br> in Jakarta. Lead-in for story.<br> Exclusive interview with head<br> of the Indonesian Communist Party.<br> Piece begins in five seconds.<br> "Sukarno has yielded to the<br> demands of Communist Party members...<br> "in Indonesian cabinet that<br> a 'Fifth Force' is to be established."<br> - That's bullshit!<br> - The worrying thing is...<br> it's well-written bullshit,<br> and it's right here in my paper.<br> My paper wants me to match it.<br> Here they are now.<br> Sir Guy and the Black Dwarf.<br> Congratulations, Hamilton.<br> You've squeezed the test match<br> into two columns.<br> Sorry about that.<br> - Want a beer?<br> - Great.<br> Ali!<br> You really think Sukarno's gonna let<br> the Commies have their own army?<br> - That's what Aidit said.<br> - Aidit's lying.<br> - Maybe.<br> - Why report it?<br> - Maybe he isn't.<br> - You know why he let you interview him?<br> No. Tell us, Pete.<br> Because he knew a more experienced<br> journalist wouldn't have even filed it.<br> Really, Pete?<br> If Aidit told you he had a toothache,<br> you'd file it.<br> You've been after him for months<br> trying to get him to tell you something.<br> The story stinks, and you know it.<br> Sukarno's not stupid.<br> He lets the Communists have arms, and<br> we'll have a civil war here tomorrow.<br> - Yeah, that's right.<br> - There better not be.<br> - I'm gettin' married in December.<br> - Don't lose any sleep over it.<br> This story's bullshit,<br> and when I file...<br> I'm gonna piss on it<br> from a great height, mate.<br> You do that, buddy.<br> It's about the only...<br> - Guy! No!<br> - Simmer down! Stop it!<br> - Did you see that?<br> - Forget it.<br> Next time, pal.<br> Jesus!<br> I must confess, Hamilton...<br> that I probably would have infused it<br> with a little more skepticism...<br> but bitter resentment won't prevent me<br> from admitting it was a good piece.<br> Well done.<br> Now smile and shake hands.<br> Beauty among the squalor.<br> I took that with a 200 millimeter.<br> Got a natural elegance, haven't they?<br> All I ever see you shoot are tits.<br> Quit trying to sell us<br> the pursuit of abstract beauty...<br> and admit you're a pervert.<br> Billy, you're a professional.<br> Is that pornography or art?<br> If it's in focus, it's pornography.<br> If it's out of focus, it's art.<br> Definitely art. Mmm.<br> They really are<br> exquisite creatures, aren't they?<br> Let me ask you something. I've<br> worried about this since you got here.<br> - What do you do for sex?<br> - You're worried about that?<br> Whenever I hit the front page,<br> I get a hard-on.<br> - So what do you do?<br> - I go up to the cemetery.<br> Are you a necrophiliac?<br> It's where the prostitutes hang out.<br> Fantastic girls, Hamilton.<br> Best value-for-your-money ass<br> in Asia.<br> I'll take you up there<br> right now, huh?<br> - Some other time.<br> - Wise man.<br> - They're riddled with VD.<br> - You never heard of penicillin?<br> You will love this action.<br> You want to spend the night?<br> Costs you one dollar.<br> Starvation's a great aphrodisiac.<br> Keep it up, Billy. We'll just<br> nail you to the old cross, huh?<br> He can afford to be virtuous.<br> He's holding hands<br> with the best-lookin' chick in town.<br> She's a friend.<br> Sure she is, Billy.<br> You'd find that kind of relationship<br> hard to understand.<br> Get me the nails.<br> I'm gonna hang the little bastard up<br> right now.<br> You've been holdin' out on me.<br> Here we are. Come on.<br> Not too much, Hamilton.<br> Take it easy.<br> All right. That's enough.<br> Hey, Billy, grab one of these.<br> Go on! Go on.<br> Come on. Out of the way.<br> We're trying to eat here.<br> You ever have these?<br> This stuff is terrific.<br> I want you to meet your new best friend.<br> I bought him for you.<br> Dance for my pal.<br> - Do a dance for my pal.<br> - Okay.<br> - Get him outta here.<br> - I bought him for you, pal.<br> He's yours.<br> He goes wherever you go.<br> Oh, God.<br> - It was just a joke.<br> - Just a joke.<br> - Hey, Wally...<br> - Forget it.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Billy, it was a joke.<br> Forget it.<br> Billy, what's that weird noise?<br> It's the bamboo,<br> but there is a spirit here.<br> I hear him outside at night.<br> He came inside one night and spilled<br> some bottles of developer.<br> - Do you really believe that stuff?<br> - Absolutely, old man.<br> The unseen is all around us...<br> particularly here in Java.<br> G'day, sport.<br> G'day.<br> One of us.<br> Air-conditioning, huh? I thought you<br> were living like the people.<br> I keep a lot of film stock here.<br> It's kinder to it.<br> Kinder to you too, eh?<br> Okay, okay. But everything else here<br> is your basic Indonesia.<br> A normal man<br> of normal intelligence...<br> capable of having<br> normal children...<br> but whose body is a joke.<br> But the one great advantage<br> of being a dwarf...<br> is that you can be wiser than<br> other people and no one envies you.<br> You're not a dwarf.<br> That's what I like<br> about you, Guy.<br> You don't care, do you?<br> Or maybe you just don't see.<br> - Want some tea?<br> - Love some.<br> This picture of Sukarno...<br> - It's me.<br> - It's you. Yeah.<br> I dressed for the part.<br> He's quite a hero of mine.<br> I think he's a genius.<br> He's really trying to do<br> something for his people.<br> To them, he's a god.<br> That's the real Jakarta.<br> Scrounging for handfuls of rice<br> to keep alive another day.<br> That's a story you journos<br> don't tell in your reports.<br> - Nobody wants to hear it.<br> - Tell them anyway.<br> Why don't you exhibit these?<br> I don't care about the photographs.<br> I care about the content.<br> I'm not very aesthetically minded.<br> That explains all those<br> terrible shirts you get around in.<br> You like my puppets?<br> If you want to understand Java...<br> you have to understand<br> the wajang...<br> the sacred shadow play.<br> The puppet master was a priest.<br> That's why they call Sukarno<br> the great puppet master...<br> balancing the left<br> with the right.<br> Their shadows are souls,<br> and the screen is heaven.<br> You must watch their shadows...<br> not the puppets.<br> The right in constant struggle<br> with the left.<br> The forces of light and darkness<br> in endless balance.<br> In the West, we want answers<br> for everything.<br> Everything is right or wrong<br> or good or bad.<br> But in the wajang, no such<br> final conclusions exist.<br> Look at Prince Arjuna.<br> He's a hero.<br> But he can also be fickle<br> and selfish.<br> Krishna says to him...<br> "All is clouded<br> by desire, Arjuna...<br> "as a fire by smoke...<br> "as a mirror by dust.<br> "Through these,<br> it blinds the soul."<br> Pretty good stuff.<br> This is the Princess Srikandi.<br> Noble and proud but headstrong.<br> Arjuna will fall in love with her.<br> Who's this one?<br> He's very special.<br> The dwarf, Semar.<br> What does he do?<br> He serves the prince.<br> That's my Jilly.<br> There's someone<br> you should get to know.<br> - Who?<br> - The chap with the mustache.<br> He's British military attach.<br> - Colonel.<br> - Ah, Kwan.<br> This is Guy Hamilton from A.B.S.<br> - Colonel Ralph Henderson.<br> - How are you?<br> Been listening to your broadcasts.<br> - More interesting than your predecessor.<br> - Thank you.<br> Jilly.<br> Billy, what are you doing here?<br> - You never come to the pool.<br> - I brought someone to meet you.<br> - Really?<br> - I knew I'd find you here.<br> This is my special friend,<br> Jilly Bryant. Guy Hamilton.<br> - Drinks all around?<br> - Yes, please.<br> Gin and tonics for everyone?<br> - Four.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You're staying at the hotel?<br> You're lucky. It's delightful.<br> We're at the ambassador's residence<br> since the locals destroyed our embassy.<br> - I hear they tore the place apart.<br> - Yes, they seemed to have fun.<br> - It was all rather droll.<br> - It was anything but droll.<br> Didn't some clown keep playing<br> the bagpipes the whole time?<br> That was Ralph.<br> It helped the morale.<br> I bet you're counting<br> the days now, Jilly.<br> - Oh, three weeks.<br> - 'Til what?<br> - 'Til I go home.<br> - Where's that?<br> - London.<br> - Had enough of the tropics?<br> I've been on the move five years.<br> I'd like to go someplace and stay.<br> Oh, here are the drinks.<br> - What's this?<br> - Gin and tonic, sir.<br> - Gin, tonic and ice.<br> - Gin and tonic always with ice, sir.<br> Gin and tonic<br> does not always have ice.<br> - Americans always use ice.<br> - Ralph.<br> - Get me another.<br> - I'll take it.<br> - Who's for a swim?<br> - Not me.<br> I promised myself<br> an afternoon of laziness.<br> - How about you, Jilly?<br> - No. I've only just come out.<br> - Come in again.<br> - No.<br> Stay here. Keep Billy company.<br> - Hamilton, I'll give you a race.<br> - A race?<br> You Australians are supposed to be<br> able to swim, aren't you?<br> I hope you're fit.<br> When Ralph says race, he means it.<br> There's no sense being halfhearted.<br> Games are a serious business<br> with the English. Right, Colonel?<br> They have their place.<br> - Come on, Hamilton.<br> - Is he serious?<br> All right.<br> Wish me luck.<br> What do you think?<br> - About what?<br> - Hamilton.<br> Oh. Cheeky.<br> Come on, Colonel.<br> Keep pace.<br> - Paddle!<br> - Come on, Ralph!<br> Don't turn back now.<br> Up the A.B.S., Hamilton!<br> Go, go, go.<br> Well done, Ralph.<br> The nearest anyone's<br> come to beating him.<br> - He had you worried, didn't he, Colonel?<br> - Indeed he did.<br> Congratulations.<br> I find we have<br> something else in common.<br> We are divided men.<br> Your father, American;<br> mine, Chinese.<br> We're not really certain<br> we're Australian, you and I.<br> We're not quite at home<br> in the world.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> Tiger Lily?<br> What's the matter with him?<br> He's having troubles<br> with the military.<br> What sort of trouble?<br> His father has a small shop.<br> Each week the military comes<br> to ask for money.<br> He has no more money,<br> and he's afraid.<br> No, boss. I'm not<br> looking for handouts.<br> I get more than that each week...<br> exchanging dollars<br> on the black market.<br> Don't be stupid, Kumar.<br> Keep the dough.<br> For my father,<br> I'll play the beggar.<br> - American embassy.<br> - Who is it?<br> P.K.I.<br> - Got the Bell and Howell loaded?<br> - Chockablock.<br> Any hairs on the lens?<br> You worry about the words.<br> I'll take care of the pictures.<br> See that you do.<br> Hey, you, come on. You're driving.<br> Me... me driving?<br> Camera!<br> P.K.I. Demand complete break<br> with America.<br> They're getting pretty confident,<br> aren't they?<br> They have a lot of support.<br> Enough to take over?<br> Perhaps.<br> P.K.I.!<br> Camera!<br> At least they would<br> give us discipline.<br> Stalin had good discipline.<br> He wiped out ten million.<br> Hey, Hortono.<br> Take us up closer to the gates.<br> - Christ, what do we do now?<br> - I think we get out.<br> Better not, boss! Boss!<br> Up! Hamilton, get me up!<br> You don't take no photo!<br> - No photo!<br> - Foreign press!<br> - Foreign press!<br> - Don't take no photo!<br> Australian press!<br> Get off him!<br> Get back here!<br> - Come on!<br> - Let go, you bastard!<br> Oh, shit!<br> Get out!<br> Get back!<br> Bastards!<br> Shit! The bastard cut me!<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yeah. Did you get the shot?<br> Yes!<br> Is that all right?<br> Yeah, fine.<br> What do you think of her?<br> Who?<br> Not my type.<br> Oh. Why's that?<br> It's her attitude. You know how<br> the British can be so damn superior?<br> It's like the colonel<br> with his gin, tonic and ice.<br> - Jill is not like that at all.<br> - No?<br> Who's that<br> in the photograph with her?<br> Philippe. He's a French journalist.<br> He was working here for a while.<br> - Were they, uh...<br> - Yeah, they were.<br> Then he got transferred. It's difficult<br> for a woman like Jilly here.<br> Why?<br> Every guy she meets<br> wants to get her into bed.<br> And it's your job<br> to keep 'em at bay?<br> Sorry.<br> I asked her to marry me once.<br> She turned me down.<br> What about the colonel?<br> I don't know.<br> She's fond of him.<br> You gotta watch that sort of thing<br> in the tropics.<br> I'm gonna get you<br> a penicillin tablet.<br> I guess I'll survive. Thanks.<br> What is all this stuff?<br> Thank you.<br> - Who you workin' for, Billy?<br> - For you.<br> - The Communists? The CIA?<br> - Stop it.<br> Why do you keep a file on me?<br> - I keep files on everybody.<br> - What for?<br> That's my business.<br> - Lf you're an operative...<br> - I'm not.<br> How am I supposed to know that?<br> You're gonna have to trust me,<br> aren't you?<br> We're friends, aren't we?<br> We make a good team.<br> We even look alike.<br> It's true.<br> It's been noticed.<br> We got the same color eyes.<br> Here.

Ibu, doctor.<br> You understand?<br> Can't make her understand<br> that the canal...<br> which she and Udin bathe in<br> and drink from carries disease.<br> In another country,<br> she would be a decent woman.<br> Here she begs<br> and perhaps sells herself.<br> Her tragedy is repeated<br> a million times in this city.<br> "What then must we do?"<br> "We must give with love to whomever<br> God has placed in our path."<br> - What is it?<br> - What's the big occasion?<br> Gentlemen,<br> an important announcement.<br> I have secured me<br> a portion of Indonesia.<br> So have I. She's waiting<br> for me in my room.<br> A beachhead of tranquility,<br> a private domain, a haven.<br> I have taken me a bungalow.<br> - What?<br> - A bungalow?<br> - What'd you do that for?<br> - Nobody lives here.<br> Let's see how long you last in this...<br> Where is your drink?<br> Come along.<br> Up!<br> Who do I look like?<br> A Chinese-Australian<br> in a pitji cap.<br> That's right!<br> I'll say one thing for you.<br> Anglo-Saxons are better...<br> in the tropics!<br> Anglo-Saxons better in the tropics<br> Anglo-Saxons are better<br> in the tropics<br> Let's hit it, baby.<br> They were hollowed out.<br> Hello, Peter.<br> Are you enjoying the party?<br> - Mora...

I'm sorry.<br> Anglo-Saxons<br> are better in the tropics<br> Anglo-Saxons...<br> You spoil me, Hadji.<br> I would never do that.<br> - Curfew time.<br> - Oh, no.<br> Come on. One more.<br> Let's put a record on.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Enjoying yourself?<br> - Let's see here.<br> - Hmm. And you?<br> - Fine.<br> - Do you know Sri?<br> - Yes. How do you do?<br> Colonel Henderson,<br> this is Jill, uh, Bryant...<br> and Billy Kwan.<br> Heard your piece on Lombok.<br> - Interesting.<br> - Interesting?<br> Yes, you're still young enough<br> and brave enough to speculate.<br> The Lombok famine<br> wasn't exactly speculation.<br> I'll get my coat.<br> Let me hear it, Jill.<br> What did you think?<br> I found it<br> a bit melodramatic.<br> That's only my opinion.<br> My flatmate was moved to tears.<br> So there you are.<br> What does it take<br> to move you to tears?<br> - Curfew.<br> - Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Right, everyone. Curfew.<br> So it begins.<br> Jesus!<br> - Put it back.<br> - But, boss...<br> I like the challenge.<br> Put it back.<br> - Hello. Is Billy here?<br> - No, I'm sorry.<br> He hasn't been in all day.<br> - We were to meet here and go for lunch.<br> - Maybe he's on his way.<br> Unless he's later than I am.<br> You wanna stick around and wait for him?<br> You want a coffee?<br> No, thank you.<br> I've interrupted you.<br> I'm glad you did.<br> It's been a high-wastage day.<br> If Billy does come back...<br> tell him I've gone back<br> to the embassy.<br> You got a car?<br> - I'll take a taxi.<br> - I can give you a lift if you like.<br> That's all right.<br> I can get a taxi.<br> I really did wanna get hold<br> of Billy myself.<br> Maybe we could drive over<br> to his place and wait there.<br> He's bound to turn up.<br> - I'll get my jacket.<br> - In back of the door.<br> Boss? Have you forgotten?<br> The circuit to Sydney.<br> - What time?<br> - 2:00.<br> The Subandrio piece.<br> It's not important.

A bit of constructive<br> criticism never goes astray.<br> What did you think<br> was melodramatic about it?<br> - I did offend you.<br> - No, you didn't.<br> - Yes, I did.<br> - It was a good piece.<br> I know what you were talking about.<br> I was there for two months in Lombok.<br> I thought there was<br> one reference too many to children...<br> with gaunt rib cages<br> and dull, listless eyes.<br> - The rest of it was fine.<br> - You were there.<br> Rib cages and eyes<br> are the real thing, eh?<br> Perhaps you only needed<br> to mention it once.<br> - They always do that.<br> - What?<br> They wanna touch<br> your white skin.<br> I'm curious about something.<br> What's that?<br> Why did you let Ralph<br> win that swimming race?<br> You're observant, aren't you?<br> - Why'd you do it?<br> - It seemed important to him.<br> - Are you always that generous?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - So why?<br> - I don't know.<br> I guess he reminded me of my father.<br> Same bald head, mustache.<br> - He was killed in the war.<br> - How'd you know that?<br> - Billy told me.<br> - Billy told you.<br> Billy? Anyone home?<br> Was Philippe a good journalist?<br> - One of the best.<br> - Where is he now?<br> Saigon.<br> - Did Billy tell you?<br> - Yeah.<br> You and he have become<br> quite a team.<br> He thinks the world of you.<br> God, I don't know why.<br> - You're everything he'd like to be.<br> - He's a strange little guy, you know?<br> How does he get me an interview<br> with the top Communist in Indonesia?<br> - You think he's an agent?<br> - Well, maybe.<br> You don't know him very well.<br> He's a cameraman.<br> How does he get such good contacts?<br> I don't know.<br> People trust him.<br> He breezes into every embassy reception<br> whether he's invited or not.<br> No one can get up the courage<br> to ask him to leave.<br> He's keeping a file on me. Why does he<br> do that if he's not an agent?<br> - He keeps files on many people.<br> - What kind of people?<br> People he cares about.<br> - Has he told you about lbu?<br> - Who's that?<br> A woman he's adopted<br> from the Kampong.<br> Billy's got a woman?<br> More than that.<br> - That's not his kid, is it?<br> - No.<br> He gives them food<br> and money, that's all.<br> The old boy.<br> - Would you like a cup of tea?<br> - Better not.<br> I got interviews to do at Priok.<br> You wanna come?<br> To Priok?<br> You can keep an eye<br> on the melodrama.<br> What do you do at the embassy?<br> Apart from socializing.<br> I work with Ralph.<br> You a spy?<br> You're a spook, aren't you?<br> If I were, I'd hardly<br> tell you, would I?<br> What agency did Philippe work for?<br> When did he go to Saigon?<br> A long time ago.<br> Arrogant lot, aren't they?<br> - Who?<br> - The French.<br> I find them absolutely charming.<br> - Hey!<br> - Don't you love the tropics?<br> Torrential.

Right now we're celebrating.<br> - What are you celebrating?<br> - Curtis got Saigon.<br> Curtis got Saigon.<br> Well, we must all drink to that.<br> Don't give me this crap tonight.<br> Wherever human misery is at its worst,<br> the press will be there in force.<br> - To Saigon!<br> - Give me a break.<br> People are out there fighting<br> in the streets for rice.<br> I shot some footage.<br> Does anybody want it?<br> It's a temporary shortage.<br> Why don't you tell them<br> the true story, gentlemen?<br> Why don't you tell them that Sukarno<br> makes empty speeches...<br> and builds monuments to his vanity<br> while his people starve to death.<br> Tell them that he says,<br> "Eat rats!"<br> You were the one who told us<br> he was a great man.<br> He was. That's why<br> his betrayal is so hideous.<br> Steady on, Billy.<br> I've never agreed with you...<br> on just how much the people<br> mean to Sukarno.<br> The only thing he wanted to do for<br> his people was to go to bed with them.<br> The female ones, that is.<br> You're right. He does use his people<br> as objects of pleasure, but so do you.<br> Only you do it with boys!<br> What did you say?<br> You little bastard!<br> - They'll throw him out of the country!<br> - You're no better, you and your girls!<br> Put him down!<br> I'll have my bags packed tonight.<br> I want to talk to you!<br> Billy, stop!<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - What do you want?<br> - You made the broadcast.<br> - I didn't source that back to Jill.<br> - Doesn't matter. That's not the point.<br> - Yes, it is the point.<br> When this thing breaks, it could change<br> the political shape of Southeast Asia.<br> How far are my loyalties<br> to Jill supposed to go?<br> I would have given up the world for her.<br> You won't give up one story.<br> It's not just a story.<br> It's the bloody story.<br> Can't you understand that?<br> Don't you understand?<br> You've lost Jill.<br> What have you told her?<br> I gave her to you. I'm taking<br> her back. Do you understand?<br> You gave her to me?<br> For Christ's sake.<br> You mad little bastard!<br> You think you can control people's lives<br> just 'cause you got 'em in your files?<br> I believed in you.<br> I thought you were a man of light.<br> That's why I gave you those stories<br> you think are so important.<br> I made you see things.<br> I made you feel something<br> about what you write.<br> I gave you my trust.<br> So did Jill.<br> I created you.<br> Oh, my God.<br> My God.<br> My God.<br> What then must we do?<br> What then must we do?<br> What then...<br> must we do?<br> We must...<br> Very nice.<br> Room 719?<br> Excuse me.<br> - I made the broadcast.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> I got it confirmed<br> straight from the P.K.I.<br> I decided to tell you.<br> You're a journalist.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Mr. Davis, security check.<br> What's going on?<br> You see the notice<br> on the door here?<br> Hey, Guy! Come on!<br> I didn't mean to frighten you.<br> You shouldn't be here.<br> Security men are all over.<br> I know. I don't<br> want them to get his files.<br> He was murdered, wasn't he?<br> Yeah.<br> Over a banner, and Sukarno<br> didn't even see it.<br> - Who took this?<br> - He did.<br> Self-timer, outside that grotty little<br> restaurant he always used to drag me to.<br> "Best food in Jakarta, old man."<br> God, I loved him.<br> When you leaving?<br> Tomorrow.<br> What time?<br> I never wanted to hurt you<br> by running that story.<br> I wanted to talk to you about it.<br> I don't want to lose you.<br> You go first. Back door.<br> - What about you?<br> - I'll be right behind you. Go!<br> Jill. I'll be on that plane.<br> What's going on?<br> I gotta get to the airport.<br> What is it?<br> What's going on?<br> Some people have<br> taken over government.<br> Troops have moved...<br> to the president's palace.<br> Let's go.<br> Broadcast say<br> we should not go out.<br> It's okay. They won't touch us.<br> Come on. Come on!<br> I think you better keep<br> the engine running, eh?<br> Press. Foreign press.<br> A.B.S. Press.<br> I don't understand you.<br> I want to go to the palace.<br> Take me to the airport.<br> Can't, boss. Roadblock.<br> - Take me to Billy Kwan's.<br> - Okay, boss.<br> The retina is detached.<br> You must lie very still.<br> - How long?<br> - A week, maybe. Ten days.<br> If you wish to save your eye,<br> you will lie still.<br> You have to bandage both eyes?<br> - I'll be helpless.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Your eye will be better?<br> Maybe not.<br> Lucky still got one.<br> But men might come soon, I think.<br> I must go home to family.<br> I'm sorry, boss.<br> Good-bye, Hortono.<br> Good-bye, boss.<br> Krishna says to him...<br> "All is clouded by desire, Arjuna...<br> "as a fire by smoke,<br> as a mirror by dust.<br> "Through these,<br> it blinds the soul."<br> Who is that?<br> Hortono? Who's that?<br> It's me, boss.<br> Have you been sent to kill me?<br> We have failed.<br> We have been overcome<br> by the Muslim generals.<br> What about Sukarno?<br> He is finished. He will<br> become a puppet of the Right.<br> And you?<br> I'm a dead man.<br> I'm sorry about your eye.<br> There should be a packet of cigarettes<br> on the table. Help yourself.<br> Still the good cigarettes, boss.<br> Thank you.<br> Tell me something.<br> Sure.<br> Am I a stupid man?<br> Then why should I live<br> like a poor man all my life...<br> when stupid people<br> in your country live well?<br> Good question.<br> - Then please answer it.<br> - I can't.<br> Then why do you condemn<br> those in my country...<br> who try to do something about it?<br> Mister Billy Kwan was right.<br> Westerners do not have<br> answers anymore.<br> Water from the moon.<br> What does that mean?<br> It's an old Javanese saying.<br> Means something<br> one cannot ever have.<br> What time is it?<br> Just past 1:00.<br> - The airport closed?<br> - Not yet...<br> but everything will close down<br> when the army proclaims martial law.<br> Drive me there.<br> They have roadblocked the city.<br> Never stopped us before.<br> They will arrest me.<br> You can wait here to die,<br> or you can drive me to the airport...<br> and then take the car<br> up into the hills.<br> Why do you have to leave now?<br> You can stay and write<br> all the stories you want.<br> I hope to catch a plane<br> is worth losing your eye.<br> Go around, Kumar. Go up.<br> Easy. Don't show them<br> anything, Kumar.<br> You go up to the...<br> Calmly. Calm.<br> Easy.<br> - What's he want?<br> - Papers.<br> Corporal, here's my papers.<br> Australian Broadcasting Service.<br> I'm a journalist. He's my assistant.<br> We must go to the airport.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - I'm sorry...<br> - Don't worry.<br> We will win because<br> we believe in something.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Think of me, Guy...<br> when you're sitting<br> in some nice cafe in Europe.<br> In my dreams, I'm always<br> sitting at the table...<br> by the footpath,<br> drinking coffee.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Now go.<br> Quickly!<br> - No!<br> - I got a ticket, asshole!<br> No bags.
