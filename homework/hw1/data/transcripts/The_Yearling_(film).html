                        Lake George, Florida. April, 1878.<br> I came across this lake once,<br> some years ago...<br> ... in a boat that brought me home<br> after the war with the Yankees.<br> Came down this river,<br> going back into the wilderness...<br> ... away from civilization,<br> looking for a place to settle...<br> ... a place to live,<br> back into the scrub country.<br> It got wilder as I got deeper<br> into the woods.<br> I liked it. Vegetation was denser.<br> The trees had to struggle<br> for a breath of air.<br> Even wilder here, as I got back<br> closer to the sources...<br> ... to the beginning of things,<br> further away from towns and wars.<br> And then I left the river,<br> went right into the woods themselves.<br> And here was the scrub country.<br> Not many people lived here then,<br> just a few pioneers.<br> I found myself a wonderful wife<br> in a little village nearby.<br> Between us, out of this sea of trees,<br> we cleared and cultivated...<br> ... a little piece of half-fertile<br> ground we call islands, like this one.<br> That was many years ago,<br> but we still live here.<br> We've had our hardships<br> and our happinesses.<br> This is our home.<br> It's called Baxter's Island.<br> That's my name, Penny Baxter.<br> Here's where we live:<br> Me, my wife, Ora,<br> and our little boy, Jody.<br> Jody!<br> Jody!<br> Hev, coon. Them's mighty prettv<br> little fellas you got.<br> Jody!<br> You want Jody, Ma?<br> Where's that boy at?<br> I reckon he's around somewhere.<br> Most likely gallivanting somewhere<br> where it don't do nobody any good.<br> He's doing what's got to be done.<br> - I need some water!<br> - Well, we'll bring you some, Ma.<br> - When did you get back?<br> - Just got back now.<br> - Hello, Pa.<br> - Hello, Jody.<br> - Gets late mighty quick, Pa.<br> - That's April for you. Where you been?<br> To the glen.<br> I lay down and I was asleep.<br> Come, Caesar.<br> I aimed to follow some bees<br> and find the bee tree.<br> - You find it?<br> - I forget to look for it, till now.<br> Now tell the truth<br> and shame the devil.<br> Wasn't that bee tree an excuse<br> to go rambling?<br> I had a notion to go rambling.<br> That's what I figured. I was saving to<br> mvself, "There's Ma, busy in the house.<br> There's Jody hoeing<br> in the corn field all by himself.<br> The hoe gets heavier every minute.<br> I bet he's thinking,<br> 'I ought to go rambling."'<br> - That the way you figured?<br> - Yes, Pa.<br> Ma don't hold with rambling.<br> Most women can't see<br> how a man loves so to ramble.<br> I never let on you wasn't here.<br> I said, "He's around."<br> - Us men has got to stick together.<br> - Yes, Pa.<br> - Pa?<br> - Yes, boy?<br> I seen a sight today down at the glen.<br> A mammy coon with two babies.<br> - They was the prettiest little fellas.<br> - Coons is prettv.<br> Is it worth speaking to Ma about it?<br> They was so prettv, if I snare me one<br> for a pet, even Ma would love it.<br> Your ma ain't gonna love no coon.<br> Reckon she'd get mad<br> if I mentioned it?<br> What do you reckon?<br> - You two home at last?<br> - Yes, Ma!<br> I reckon she would.<br> But I wish I had me something<br> to pet and play with.<br> - You said men have to stick together.<br> - That's right, boy.<br> If you was to speak to Ma<br> about that little coon...<br> No, thank you.<br> I ain't aiming to die afore my time.<br> Get down to the sinkhole<br> and bring your ma some water.<br> Yes, Pa.<br> Hev, Ma! I like you, Ma!<br> You get mighty loving<br> when I got a dish in my hand.<br> That's when you're the prettiest.<br> That ain't sweet tater pone, is it?<br> - It is.<br> - It's sweet tater pone!<br> Pa, a big old buck watered down<br> at the glen today. I seen his...<br> When was you down at the glen?<br> today, Ma.<br> So that's it.<br> And me calling and calling.<br> You getting slick as a clay road<br> in the rain.<br> - I fooled you! I got to fool you once!<br> - You fooled me.<br> - Evening, Ma.<br> - And you just as bad as the boy.<br> You both getting mighty slv.<br> Sit down afore the pone steams off.<br> Dear Lord, thanks again<br> for the vittles. Amen.<br> I declare,<br> that's a mighty skimpy blessing.<br> I get hungry when I go logging.<br> The Lord will know what I mean.<br> Ma?

If I<br> should find mvself one. Or a possum?<br> I'd love to have a baby fox<br> or a baby panther.<br> But I just gotta have me a pet.<br> We got milk aplentv.<br> You think we got milk aplentv?<br> There ain't an extra drop.<br> - It could have mine!<br> - You're spindly enough as it is.<br> How can we spare rations for critters?<br> We can barely keep our bellies full.<br> I just want something all my own.<br> Something to follow me and be mine.<br> Something with dependence to it.<br> Well, you'll not find that nowhere.<br> Not in the animal world<br> nor in the world of man.<br> Going on 12 and still wanting<br> some kind of a play dollv.<br> Pa was doing his man's share<br> of work at your age.<br> Stop pestering and get to bed<br> afore I take a brush to you.<br> Yes'm.<br> Good night.<br> - Good night, Pa.<br> - Good night, son.<br> Seems like you get mighty hard<br> on the boy at times, Ora.<br> Let him tend to work.<br> Alwavs running off...<br> ...wanting to bring critters back.<br> Well, a boy ain't a boy too long.<br> Leave him kick up his heels a little.<br> Day will come, he won't even want to.<br> Ora, I've seen our boy stand agaze...<br> ...and breathless at the wonderment<br> of bird and critter...<br> ...wind, rain, the sun and the moon...<br> ...just like I stood when I was a boy<br> in the forest.<br> Don't be afraid to love the boy, Ora.<br> I'll put up the stock.<br> What's the matter, Pa?<br> Your ma's gone down<br> to the burving ground, son.<br> Pa, a couple of old buck deer were<br> in our burving grounds today.<br> I seen their tracks.<br> Ora's and David's markers<br> were knocked down.<br> - Well, your ma wouldn't like that.<br> - I was obliged to right them.<br> One marker had something<br> written on it...<br> ...but it's getting kind of dim.<br> I can't make it out.<br> That's Ezra Jr.<br> He never seen the light of dav.<br> He died when he was born?<br> That's right, son.<br> - Ma never talks about them, does she?<br> - No.<br> Are they part of Ma's raring, Pa?<br> - You figured that out all by yourself?<br> - I was just wondering.<br> I'm proud you're looking<br> for the reason of things.<br> Figuring out what makes people rare<br> when they don't mean it.<br> - Your ma's a wonderful woman, Jody.<br> - Yes, Pa.<br> When we come here, years ago,<br> she was prettv...<br> ...and full of the fun of life.<br> This place was a wilderness.<br> Your ma thought it were beautiful.<br> She pitched right in<br> and worked as hard as I did.<br> We made it a kind of game,<br> clearing this place we got.<br> The two of us together out here<br> in the wilderness.<br> A man couldn't have had a better wife.<br> Then when we lost the children,<br> one after the other.<br> It ain't easy for a woman to have<br> her young'uns taken away from her.<br> It does something to her. Makes<br> something inside her close up tight...<br> ...so if it happens again,<br> she won't let it hurt her so much.<br> I was luckv, weren't I, Pa?<br> I'm 11 years old.<br> I'm way past the age of dving.<br> What you two doing?
