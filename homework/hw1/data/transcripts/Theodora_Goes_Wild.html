                        Hello!<br> Yeah, I'm listening. But I know just exactly<br> what you're going to say.<br> What?<br> Well, that's just too bad, Mrs. Moffat.<br> But I happen to be running this paper<br> and I think it was fit to print.<br> Good day to you.<br> Mrs. Moffat that time.<br> Stand by, Henry, for full returns.<br> Fifty other Lynnfield hens<br> will be heard from yet.<br> This hen says, "Not fit to print."<br> Yes, siree.<br> Hello, who is it and what...<br> Yes, yes, I know, Mrs. Perry, I know.<br> I know you don't like<br> that Caroline Adams novel<br> I'm running serially in the Bugle.<br> Yeah, unmoral and not fit to print. Yes.<br> Yes, Mrs. Perry. That is right. Yes.<br> Now look here, Mrs. Perry,<br> let me tell you something. I apologize.<br> I apologize for breaking my neck<br> trying to buy the serial rights<br> to the best-selling novel of the day.<br> I apologize for waking the town of Lynnfield<br> out of a 20-year sleep<br> to show it how people live and learn<br> and love in the wide-awake world.<br> I apologize.<br> The buzzards are swooping<br> down on us, Henry.<br> Yes, siree. Hot diggety.<br> Say, get your nose out of that paper<br> and answer the phone once in a while.<br> I want to eat some lunch.<br> Hello. Yeah.<br> -Yeah. Who is it?<br> -Who is it?<br> -Miss Lynn.<br> -Here, give me that.<br> Hello, Theodora.<br> No, don't tell me you called up<br> about that Caroline Adams story.<br> I'm afraid that's it, Jed.<br> Well, you'll have to admit Caroline Adams<br> doesn't exactly write bedtime stories.<br> -Tell him it's shocking.<br> -And scandalous.<br> Aunt Mary and Aunt Elsie<br> simply can't approve, Jed.<br> So the two Lynn oracles have spoken?<br> Well, well, now, wouldn't you think<br> after five generations<br> the Lynn family would be<br> tired running this town?<br> But the point is, Jed, the Literary Circle<br> is up in arms against this book.<br> They're having a meeting tonight<br> to discuss it.<br> -He better be there.<br> -Aunt Mary said you'd better be there.<br> So it's come to that, has it?<br> Yes, Jed, it's come to that.<br> All right, I'll be there.<br> "'I'd better be going home,' Pamela said.<br> 'It's late.' Spencer smiled.<br> "lt seemed minutes before he answered.<br> "'Home, Pamela? Why, it's very early,<br> my dear. The night has just begun.'<br> "With these words uttered like caresses,<br> he started slowly toward her.<br> "Pamela stood rigid, frightened,<br> watching him advance.<br> "His steps were slow, deliberate.<br> Pamela felt imprisoned, helpless.<br> "She wanted to run past him out of<br> this strange apartment down to the street.<br> "But her brain was reeling with drink."<br> Oh, my.<br> "She was robbed of all purpose.<br> "'You're very beautiful tonight, Pamela,'<br> he said.<br> "The words mingled with the plaintive music<br> that filled the room.<br> "He was close to her.<br> He reached out violently.<br> "His hands fastened on her arms<br> and pinned them to her sides.<br> "She was suddenly pressed<br> tightly against him.<br> "He spoke in low rapid tones,<br> words she did not hear.<br> "She fought desperately<br> to break out of his grasp.<br> "'Let me go! Let me go!'<br> "She could feel his breath on her cheek<br> "and then his lips on hers<br> with a shocking, terrible suddenness.<br> "The room suddenly went dark."<br> That's enough, Rebecca.<br> I think we've heard plenty.<br> Well, I should think so.<br> If you don't mind,<br> I haven't been taking the Bugle regularly<br> and I'd like to hear the rest of it.<br> You certainly don't have to<br> hear more than that<br> to make up your mind about it.<br> Don't worry, Miss Jenkins. You'll get a copy.<br> I printed 100 extra today.<br> Jed Waterbury.<br> Well, I knew they'd be in great demand<br> with the womenfolk.<br> Well, I guess we've agreed about one thing.<br> This Literary Circle isn't going to<br> let sexy trash like this<br> come right into our homes and corrupt us.<br> Now, just a second. Just a second.<br> As long as I can remember, this community<br> has had its head in the sand saying,<br> "There ain't no evil."<br> Well, then that may be all right<br> for you old people.<br> You're practically dead anyhow<br> with one foot in the grave.<br> The impudence.<br> But your youngsters ought to be told<br> what it's all about.<br> You can't keep civilization<br> out of Lynnfield forever.<br> Jed Waterbury, if civilization is<br> like Caroline Adams writes about,<br> then it's best that our children get along<br> without civilization.<br> All right.<br> Theodora, what's the Lynn family<br> got to say about this?<br> Aunt Mary and Aunt Elsie told me<br> to tell you they want the story stopped.<br> And if it isn't, the Lynnfield Bugle<br> is going to find itself without subscribers.<br> -I'm sorry, Jed.<br> -There you are. All in favor, say "aye."<br> Aye.<br> Well, is that plain enough,<br> Mr. Jed Waterbury?<br> Yep, that's plain enough.<br> I guess I know a righteous spanking<br> when I get one.<br> All right, I'll quit printing the thing.<br> Yes.<br> By the way,<br> about those extra copies of the paper,<br> come early and avoid the rush.<br> Well, now, one thing more.<br> I think it no more than right that<br> the Lynnfield Literary Circle<br> should go on record<br> and tell whoever is publishing the book<br> that this community condemns it<br> lock, stock and barrel.<br> Absolutely.<br> In fact, I make a resolution to that effect.<br> -All in favor, say "aye."<br> -Aye.<br> Well, that will hold Mr. Jed Waterbury<br> for a while.<br> Surely ought to.<br> I'm going to New York tomorrow<br> to visit Uncle John.<br> -I'll probably see Adelaide.<br> -Give the lamb my love.<br> I'll never be done thanking you, Theodora,<br> for getting her to New York<br> for a change of scenery.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> -lt was just too sweet of you<br> to take such an interest in my only child.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> I declare to goodness,<br> you're a Lynn clear through.<br> Just downright fine.<br> I'll give you a batch of cookies<br> to take in to Adelaide.<br> -All right.<br> -The soft ginger kind.<br> They won't be all crumbs<br> by the time they get to her.<br> Come to think of it, I won't send a letter<br> to that Stevenson publisher.<br> I'm going to send a telegram.<br> "Fewer and stronger words," I always say.<br> Something like this...<br> "Gentlemen, so to speak." No.<br> "ln the name of decency<br> and good morals." No.<br> "This brazen filth..."<br> "...published by you is<br> a disgrace to American morals<br> "and a sin against American youth."<br> Signed, "Rebecca Perry,<br> President, Lynnfield Literary Circle."<br> Nice going, Rebecca.<br> Miss Adams will just love this.<br> See that those contracts are ready for her<br> to sign on the movie purchase of her book.<br> Yes, Mr. Stevenson.<br> And let me have<br> an up-to-the-minute statement<br> -on the sales to date.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Show her in, please, the moment she arrives.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Miss Adams.<br> How do you do, Miss Adams?<br> -Hello.<br> -Well, come in, come in.<br> I'm awfully glad to see you.<br> Seems years between visits.<br> Come sit down. Sit down, Miss Lynn.<br> -Adams.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> But how much time do I get today?<br> Well, the usual hour.<br> Uncle John's expecting me.<br> Well, let's sit down.<br> Say, I got a wire this morning<br> that might amuse you.<br> I know. Signed Rebecca Perry.<br> Why did you sell those serial rights<br> to the Lynnfield Bugle?<br> Have you got an aspirin?<br> Well, I haven't even heard about the Bugle.<br> An aspirin for Miss Adams.<br> But I think it's very funny.<br> Very funny. Maybe you do,<br> but I had to sit and listen to it read out loud,<br> and I give you my word,<br> you have no idea<br> how indecent the stuff sounded.<br> -Well, shall we make it two aspirins?<br> -No. Really.<br> I suddenly realized I was a writer<br> of wide reputation and most of it bad.<br> I could see Lynnfield finding out the truth.<br> Aunt Mary and Aunt Elsie dying of shame.<br> The name of Lynn disgraced forever and...<br> -Your aspirin.<br> -Thank you. It won't help.<br> Here.<br> Now will you please sit down<br> and stop worrying and let me talk to you?<br> Mr. Stevenson, do you have to advertise<br> Caroline Adams in letters that size?<br> Couldn't you make them just a little bit...<br> That's what makes the size<br> of your bank account.<br> Would you like to have a look<br> at your balance?<br> Well, it couldn't possibly interest me.<br> I can't use any of it<br> without telling where I got it.<br> Will you please stop worrying?<br> Now, the identity of Caroline Adams<br> will never be known.<br> Miss Baldwin and I will carry the secret<br> to our graves.<br> Now, that ought to take care of everything,<br> oughtn't it?<br> Everything except my own conscience.<br> My dear Miss Adams, don't tell me you care<br> what the Lynnfield Literary Circle thinks?<br> I can't help it. I'm part of it.<br> I'm part of everything in Lynnfield.<br> Were you raised in a small town<br> by two maiden aunts? No!<br> Have you taught Sunday school<br> for the past 10 years? No!<br> Have you played the organ in church<br> since you were 15? No! Well, I have.<br> And right now, I ask myself,<br> where did Caroline Adams come from?<br> How did all this start?<br> You walked in here one day<br> with a very promising manuscript.<br> Yes, I thought it was just romantic.<br> I must have been out of my mind.<br> What? To write a book<br> that's sweeping the country?<br> But not a clean sweep.<br> Heaven forbid.<br> What's this?<br> The first chapter of the new book?<br> No.<br> Come on, now. What's in that package?<br> -Cookies.<br> -Cookies?<br> Rebecca made them. You know Rebecca.<br> She loves to write telegrams.<br> "Fewer and stronger words,"<br> she always says.<br> -Will you have one?<br> -No, no, no, no.<br> -Well, they're awfully good.<br> -No.<br> The soft ginger kind with no crumbs.<br> No, no, no. Now, where's that chapter?<br> It just won't write, Mr. Stevenson.<br> I've tried, honest I have.<br> I still stuff rags under my door at night<br> in case my aunts are prowling around.<br> But it's no use. I'm too upset.<br> The way I feel now, I'll never write again.<br> Now look here. Sooner or later you've<br> got to be sensible and take my advice.<br> Have it out with Lynnfield.<br> Tell them all about it. Come to New York.<br> Get yourself an apartment<br> and write me six more books.<br> -Bye-bye, Mr. Stevenson.<br> -Now wait a minute,<br> we've got some business to discuss.<br> -Not today. I'm not in the mood.<br> -All right, all right.<br> But there's one thing more,<br> and this is very important.<br> I promised my wife the first time<br> you came in, she could see you.<br> -You what?<br> -Well, I simply had to.<br> -I thought we said nobody.<br> -Well, you see, it's this way.<br> Now, she's a rabid fan of yours.<br> She just wants to look at you.<br> First it's a look. Then it's questions.<br> Then anything could happen.<br> No, no, no.<br> I swear she'll know nothing about you.<br> Now look, she's been making life<br> miserable for me,<br> -and you don't know Ethel.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> Hello.<br> -Well, I'd never believe it.<br> -This is Ethel.<br> I heard you.<br> Don't tell me you're Caroline Adams?<br> Well, I've been dying to meet you.<br> Who's this?<br> Get out of here, Michael, and shut that door.<br> You see, first it's one person, then it's two.<br> One thing about Michael,<br> he only goes where he's not invited.<br> -What do you want?<br> -So you're Caroline Adams?<br> Say, you ought to meet me.<br> I'm the man that did the cover for your book<br> and that glorious woman on the poster.<br> Well, she may be glorious,<br> but she's certainly underdressed.<br> Well, that's the way<br> I found her in your book, lady.<br> Say, are you sure you're Caroline Adams?<br> What do you mean, is she sure<br> she's Caroline Adams?<br> Well, I don't know. Caroline Adams ought to<br> look as though she'd lived.<br> Forgive me, perhaps you've got<br> a terrific constitution and it doesn't show.<br> All right, that's enough, Michael.<br> Now, either get out or go sit down.<br> I'll go sit down.<br> Well, there is a certain bloom of innocence<br> in your face that surprised me, too.<br> What did you expect to see,<br> the tattooed woman?<br> Don't be silly, lamb.<br> You know, I can't get a word<br> out of Arthur about you.<br> And I'm just dying to know things.<br> -Miss Adams has to go, pet.<br> -Yes, Uncle John's waiting for me.<br> -Whose Uncle John?<br> -Her Uncle John.<br> -Yes, my uncle.<br> -I see. You've an uncle.<br> Well, what about later?<br> Why not take dinner with us?<br> No, thank you. I couldn't.<br> You see, I have to catch the first train<br> back to... Back home.<br> -Where's that?<br> -Out west. Way out west on the range.<br> Come now,<br> there are trains leaving all night long<br> for way out west on the range.<br> You must take dinner with us, dear.<br> We'll meet you here at 6:00.<br> Well, I couldn't.<br> I didn't bring a change of clothes.<br> That's all right, we won't dress.<br> Arthur, make her stay.<br> Well, that's that, Miss Adams.<br> But we'll put you<br> on the earliest possible train after dinner.<br> -May I come to dinner, too?<br> -No.<br> All right, but I'll have to run now.<br> Goodbye, dear. Don't forget, 6:00.<br> My cookies.<br> I'm sorry, they're very good.<br> A total of $3,296.33.<br> Well, there's your aunts' income<br> for the quarter.<br> Any special instructions<br> from those two plaster saints?<br> No. Just the usual check for $300,<br> Uncle John.<br> -And put the rest away.<br> -Such virtue.<br> Tell me, dear, when are you coming to stay<br> with me for a couple of days<br> -and let me show you the town?<br> -Sometime soon. Not today, though.<br> That means never.<br> Still don't approve of me, do you?<br> No. Think I'm wicked.<br> Believe everything those two charming<br> sisters of mine tell you about me, don't you?<br> Confidentially, Uncle John,<br> are you really wicked?<br> Confidentially, honey,<br> I'm just a little short of terrific. Here.<br> There's the evidence.<br> My gallery of playmates.<br> Put them all together and you have<br> one of the most delightful careers that<br> a man has ever carved out for himself.<br> Now, meet Annabelle, 1896,<br> right down to and including Margie, 1936.<br> Shocked to death, aren't you?<br> That pained expression of yours<br> is just like Mary's.<br> They're making a fine job of you, all right.<br> Listen, baby.<br> Anyone ever call you baby?<br> -No.<br> -Pity.<br> And they never will in Lynnfield.<br> Theodora.<br> Adelaide.<br> -How are you, darling?<br> -I'm fine.<br> -Mother isn't worried or suspicious?<br> -No, not a bit.<br> She thinks you're working for Mrs. Jamison<br> and that you're so happy.<br> -Have you heard from Roger?<br> -No.<br> You still don't want to tell him?<br> If his mother has frightened him<br> away from me,<br> I don't want to bring him back<br> because of this.<br> Of course, at the same time,<br> I can't let you and Uncle John<br> go on keeping me.<br> Who said so? Why, I wouldn't let you go.<br> Why, young chickens like you<br> are a tonic to me.<br> Do you see? Run along now,<br> take off your coat and we'll have some tea.<br> By the way, your mother sent<br> some cookies for you,<br> but I met a hungry man and he ate them up.<br> You run along, dear.<br> You know, Theodora,<br> this low trick you're playing on Lynnfield<br> tells me that there's hope for you yet.<br> Of course, not much, but just a little.<br> -But there's nothing low about it.<br> -No?<br> You're only hoping to conceal it<br> from Rebecca Perry<br> the fact that<br> her daughter is going to have a baby.<br> You lie about finding her work in New York,<br> and you hide her away<br> with your sinful old uncle.<br> Adelaide's married.<br> Of course, that makes all the difference<br> in the world, doesn't it?<br> Well, I had to do something about it.<br> The poor girl was frantic.<br> Their parents don't know<br> anything about her being married<br> and that baby husband of hers<br> going back to school.<br> That's the old spirit. And I love you for it.<br> And I'm going to be proud of you yet.<br> Not if I can help it, Uncle.<br> Well, this is fine. Here we are.<br> Cute little place, isn't it? Good evening.<br> Did you ever see so many<br> hors d'oeuvres in all your life?<br> You can take all you want.<br> That's the nice part about it.<br> Yes. Ethel always comes here<br> after one of her 18-day diets.<br> Well, it's a quaint little place.<br> Yeah, little Swedish restaurant<br> not many people know.<br> I thought you'd like it.<br> It's quiet and out of the way.<br> -You'd never meet a soul here you'd know.<br> -That's good.<br> -What was that, Arthur?<br> -I was just saying that<br> we carry the hors d'oeuvres to the table<br> and the rest of the meal will be served there.<br> You were? I doubt that very much.<br> Mystery, mystery. All I get is mystery.<br> I'm dying to know something<br> about Miss Adams,<br> and all I get is talk behind my back.<br> Will you lead the way, dear?<br> I must admit,<br> you've got me running in circles.<br> I thought you were a woman of 50.<br> With your hair dyed, your face lifted, and...<br> Cocktails, ladies? What'll it be?<br> Martini. And here you are,<br> an adorable young thing.<br> And your modesty, my dear.<br> Your girlish sweetness. I'm baffled.<br> -Cocktail, Miss Adams?<br> -No, thank you. None for me.<br> -Why not?<br> -Don't pester her, Ethel.<br> If she doesn't want one,<br> she doesn't want one.<br> Two martinis, please.<br> Yes, sir. They'll be at your table.<br> Now, before I pass out with curiosity,<br> tell me, don't you ever...<br> -Please, angel, please.<br> -Writers' lives are very dull, Mrs. Stevenson.<br> Very dull. I'm sure you'd be disappointed.<br> All right, I won't be a pest.<br> But you do make people curious.<br> -Now, Michael said...<br> -He's apt to say most anything, that fellow.<br> Or do anything, for that matter.<br> I like him, but he certainly<br> can be most annoying.<br> He's a trifle mad, isn't he?<br> Try some of this. It's very good.<br> How in the world did you<br> know that we were here?<br> Well, I said to myself, "lf I were Stevenson,<br> and wanted to avoid Michael,<br> "what would be the most<br> out-of-the-way place to which I'd go?"<br> And, boom, I hit it.<br> First crack out of the box.<br> How's everybody? Glad you're on time,<br> because I'm pretty hungry.<br> And I'm so glad you came here.<br> I love hors d'oeuvres.<br> Anybody ask you to have dinner with us?<br> -Not formally.<br> -Or informally?<br> Well, in a way, no.<br> Well, this is the end of the line.<br> I guess we may as well sit down.<br> Lead the way to our table, Ethel.<br> Miss Adams.<br> Arthur.<br> -Now, let's see.<br> -Wonderful food here.<br> It's a wonder you can eat anything<br> after all those cookies.<br> You know how it is with growing boys.<br> No, I don't. How is it with growing boys?<br> You've got me, pal.<br> Waiter, here and here, please.<br> Concoct another one of those for me,<br> bartender.<br> Very well, sir.<br> -Wait a minute. Not drinking?<br> -No, thank you. Not drinking.<br> -You mean you never drink?<br> -Did I say I never drink?<br> But you look as though you never drank.<br> And for Caroline Adams,<br> that's very interesting. Tell me, do you...<br> That'll do for you, Mr. Grant.<br> It's no use, Michael.<br> I've been working on Miss Adams<br> half an hour.<br> She won't let down her back hair.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> I see.<br> But the point is, has she got any back hair?<br> All this talk about drinking<br> has made me a little thirsty, though.<br> -Waiter?<br> -Yes, ma'am.<br> Straight whiskey.<br> Ethel, you're not keeping up with us.<br> Little Ethie feels like<br> she's had a drop too much.<br> You and Michael seem to<br> have been drinking your dinner.<br> I was just showing the gentleman<br> my back hair.<br> Would you say it was down now, Mr. Grant?<br> Well, I wouldn't say it wasn't.<br> Hadn't we better start thinking<br> about your train now, Caroline?<br> That's right, Arthur.<br> You keep me posted now. Keep me posted.<br> -Check, please.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Say, did I hear you say you never danced?<br> Who, me? Well, you certainly didn't.<br> I know a hot little night spot<br> that's just opened uptown.<br> -You do?<br> -That is if you go to that sort of place.<br> -Well, I write about them, don't l?<br> -That's right, you do.<br> In fact, when I hear about a new hot spot,<br> I'm like an old fire horse and the bell.<br> No.<br> You know, talking about fire horses,<br> I haven't seen a fire horse since I was a kid.<br> Well, my dear fellow,<br> you're missing something.<br> -We still have them up in our town.<br> -Where's that?<br> Wouldn't he like to know?<br> It's train time now, Caroline. Let's go.<br> There is another train in about two hours.<br> Let's just take a peek at this night spot.<br> Come on, Arthur. Come on, Ethel, make him.<br> Well, I'm not feeling my best,<br> but I started all this<br> and I'm going to finish it.<br> Here you go.<br> -Let's go. Come on.<br> -Pure accident.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> How are you doing, Caroline?<br> I'm flying.<br> I'm floating on a breeze.<br> Pure accident.<br> That was no accident, lady,<br> that was my foot.<br> Michael was right.<br> She's got a terrific constitution<br> and it doesn't show.<br> Little Goldilocks drank me<br> right under the table.<br> -I'm passing out, lamb.<br> -Here, here, dear.<br> Now, don't do anything like that.<br> We've got to put Caroline on that train.<br> Mama's big boy better get little Ethie<br> out of here right now.<br> Now, be sensible, pet.<br> We can't leave Caroline here like this.<br> We've got to put her on that train.<br> I know, way out west somewhere.<br> Michael will put her on the range.<br> Ducky, better get little Ethie out of here<br> while she can still walk.<br> Here, take my arm.<br> I wish I knew what started all this.<br> Come on, dear. Now be careful, be careful.<br> You're one of those clever fellows,<br> aren't you?<br> That's what they all say.<br> Had your mind all made up about me,<br> didn't you?<br> Thought I didn't drink.<br> Thought I didn't dance, too.<br> Pure accident.<br> Here we are, my dear. My own little nest.<br> Aren't you coming in?<br> Naturally.<br> What a lovely place, Michael.<br> It's so inspiring.<br> Coming from an expert, that's something.<br> You mean me?<br> Yes. I was referring to the apartment<br> you wrote about.<br> You know, what's-his-name's place<br> where Pamela was lured.<br> Yes. Poor little Pamela.<br> Are these your etchings?<br> Poor things, but my own.<br> Here's my latest, most ambitious work.<br> Almost finished.<br> Eve and the serpent.<br> Charming. Perfectly charming.<br> Shall I take your coat?<br> Aren't you going to stay for a while?<br> Naturally.<br> -Perhaps you don't want to stay?<br> -Why not?<br> I don't know.<br> This hour of the night, bachelor apartment.<br> You're still full of peculiar notions<br> about me, aren't you?<br> Some soft music would be nice,<br> don't you think?<br> As a matter of fact,<br> it's been playing the whole time.<br> Well, it's charming. Perfectly charming.<br> Drink?<br> Yes. I was just going to suggest that.<br> Scotch?<br> Scotch.<br> I thought you were going to get the drink?<br> Maybe I'd better go.<br> I guess it is getting pretty late.<br> Late? Why the evening's just begun, darling.<br> Did I tell you<br> how beautiful you look tonight, Caroline?<br> No.<br> Well, you do. You're adorable.<br> Don't you dare. Don't you dare!<br> You stay right where you are.<br> If you come one more step, I'll scream.<br> I'll scream. Do you hear me?<br> You keep away from me.<br> Let me get my things and my ticket home.<br> You keep away from me.<br> I'll get a policeman after you.<br> I will. I'll get a policeman.<br> You stay where you are.<br> You stay where you are.<br> Want to stop in for a snack, Rebecca?<br> Why, I don't mind if I do.<br> I hope Adelaide ain't keeping late hours<br> or traipsing around the city all by herself.<br> No. She's at home with her work<br> most of the time.<br> Reading to Mrs. Jamison.<br> She never goes out, except when...<br> Except what?<br> -What?<br> -She never goes out, except...<br> Except when she goes out.<br> That don't make sense, Theodora.<br> He looks like a stranger to me.<br> Nice day of the week<br> to be whistling a jig on the streets.<br> Looks a lot too happy for Sunday,<br> if you ask me.<br> Of course, now and then she takes a ride<br> in the park with Mrs. Jamison.<br> -Who does?<br> -Adelaide.<br> Yes, Adelaide.<br> I wonder if she hears from Roger Taylor.<br> Or did she get all that nonsense<br> out of her head?<br> Brazen-looking, isn't he?<br> About time we were discussing<br> this year's charity bazaar, Rebecca.<br> I was going to say.<br> If it's going to be a success,<br> I guess it's kind of up to the Lynns again.<br> -lt usually is.<br> -Well, we haven't shirked any duty yet.<br> Look out, child.<br> You're going to drop that cup.<br> What's gotten...<br> Him again?<br> -Yes.<br> -Walking by?<br> No, just sort of resting on the gate.<br> I'll phone Captain O'Donnell<br> and have him put that<br> good-for-nothing loafer in jail,<br> where he can whistle to his heart's content.<br> No, don't bother, Aunt Mary.<br> I'll tell him to go away.<br> Don't get too close to him.<br> How do you do, lady?<br> Right smart weather we're having.<br> You get away from here<br> and leave town as fast as you can.<br> Is that the way to greet an old friend?<br> An old drinking companion?<br> You listen to me. My two aunts and<br> the worst gossip in town are watching us.<br> As far as they're concerned,<br> I don't know a soul outside of Lynnfield.<br> And if they suspected<br> what you know about me, they'd have fits.<br> Now, be a nice man,<br> tip your hat politely and get away from here.<br> Marvelous.<br> This beats my first guess by a mile.<br> Will you please go?<br> Yep. That's a mighty fine homestead<br> you got there, lady.<br> Of course, your lawn looks a bit seedy.<br> And that vine needs training.<br> You know what you need, lady? A gardener.<br> -Don't be absurd. We never had one.<br> -Lady, you've got one.<br> Now listen to me. It simply can't be done.<br> I can start right now.<br> What's this all about?<br> Why don't he go along? What does he want?<br> I'm looking for work, ma'am. Work!<br> He's a gardener, Auntie.<br> He says he needs work.<br> Not interested.<br> Well, you ought to be, ma'am.<br> Your garden looks pretty bad to me.<br> I don't care how it looks to you.<br> Don't stand there arguing at the top<br> of your voice, young man. It's Sunday.<br> Just go along about your business.<br> Yes, go along. Go along.<br> I'm a very willing worker, ma'am!<br> Quiet!<br> I just said we don't want the garden touched,<br> and if we did, we wouldn't hire a stranger<br> we found loafing on our doorstep.<br> You got me all wrong, ma'am.<br> I ain't no loafer at heart.<br> I was just telling the little lady here<br> something of my life's story.<br> Well, you can't shout your life's story<br> out there on the street.<br> You're quite right, ma'am. I'll come in.<br> -Here, here, doggie.<br> -No, no. That's a friend of mine.<br> I just picked him up. Nice character.<br> A little down on his luck,<br> so we decided to throw in together.<br> -I suppose he gardens, too.<br> -Yeah, just with his front feet.<br> -My name is Theodora Lynn.<br> -Yes, ma'am.<br> -And wipe your feet.<br> -lt ain't raining.<br> Wipe them anyway.<br> It's always done in Lynnfield.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> -Now look here, young man.<br> -Keep your dog out of here.<br> If he as much as growls at Sylvia...<br> Come here, Jake.<br> Get him away from here.<br> Sit down.<br> My name's Dewberry, ma'am.<br> Young man, you're wasting your time.<br> I see, so you're refusing work<br> to a man who needs it,<br> who's willing to work.<br> A man who wants a chance<br> to get back his self-respect.<br> That isn't very charitable-minded, is it?<br> We're as charitable-minded as the rest,<br> young man.<br> Our acts speak for themselves, Elsie.<br> That isn't the point.<br> Well, it seems to me it is.<br> But don't worry, I'll find work.<br> I'll find it in this town, too.<br> And I'll have a lot to say<br> about how people are treated in this house.<br> In fact, I'll have a lot to say<br> about a lot of things.<br> I suppose it's our fault that<br> we can't find work for anybody<br> who comes to the door.<br> -There is some work to do, Aunt Mary.<br> -What work?<br> Well, cleaning up and sort of<br> straightening around the garden.<br> Exactly. Thank you, lady.<br> That's what I call intelligent charity.<br> I'll just give him that room in the tool house.<br> This way, please.<br> Come on, Jake. This way.<br> Well, if that don't beat all.<br> Elsie, we can't leave Theodora alone<br> with a man like that.<br> Well, of all the brassy, young no-accounts.<br> Why, I don't know what Theodora<br> can be thinking about giving him work.<br> He'll be out of here<br> before we can say Jack Robinson.<br> So I don't see any reason<br> to mention this around town, Rebecca.<br> Me? Lands, no.<br> Why, there's nothing to mention.<br> I guess Theodora was just sorry for him.<br> That's all.<br> Of course, he was sort of<br> good-looking and young.<br> Lands, I wouldn't say a word.<br> Say, this is fine.<br> I'm going to be very happy here.<br> I'll just sweep up, Aunt Elsie,<br> while you get some sheets<br> and a blanket from the house.<br> We'll get those things later.<br> I'll wait while you sweep up.<br> Yes, sir, this is what I call surroundings.<br> The kind of a place<br> that moves people to write.<br> Suppose you do your own sweeping.<br> It might save time, Aunt Elsie,<br> if you got the things now.<br> -There's no hurry.<br> -Go ahead and get whatever it is, Elsie.<br> -Aunt Mary.<br> -Go with your aunt.<br> -Say, this place is crawling with aunts.<br> -Where?<br> Sorry, lady. My mistake.<br> Come here, Jake. Come on.<br> There, with the compliments of Sylvia.<br> -There, he just put his light out.<br> -I wish he'd put his whistle out.<br> I guess we can all go to sleep now.<br> You can go to sleep if you like.<br> I'm going to sit right down here<br> all this blessed night.<br> If I'm going to be robbed,<br> at least I've got the right to know about it.<br> I can't think<br> whatever possessed you, Theodora.<br> Well, he looked so pathetic.<br> Nothing pathetic about a strange loafer.<br> Now, you just let him<br> putter around tomorrow<br> and then he goes right on his way.<br> He'd better stop that infernal tooting.<br> If he doesn't, it'll drive me crazy.<br> Want some coffee, Auntie?<br> No, thank you.<br> You haven't eaten a thing.<br> Isn't your head any better, Aunt Mary?<br> Worse.<br> That lawn mower never made<br> so much noise before.<br> Well, I guess nobody ever pushed it<br> so fast before.<br> You have to admit<br> he's a very willing worker.<br> He ought to do something<br> after the breakfast he ate.<br> Two helpings of oatmeal, four eggs,<br> and a rasher of bacon, coffee.<br> And then he says,<br> "What? No waffles, Elsie?"<br> "Elsie" he calls me!<br> And I call him<br> too altogether downright familiar.<br> Any more of his sass...<br> Get along, little doggie, get along, get along<br> Get along, little doggie, get along<br> Get along, little doggie<br> Good morning, neighbors.<br> Good morning. Morning, ma'am.<br> Get along, little doggie, get along<br> Howdy, squire. Howdy. Howdy.<br> Morning, ma'am.<br> My, my, well, dog my cats,<br> that's a mighty pretty hat you got on.<br> Looks like an heirloom.<br> Get along, little doggie, get along<br> Turn around, little doggie<br> Turn around, turn around<br> This is the end. Half of Lynnfield's<br> marching by to see that lunatic.<br> No, Rebecca wasn't going to say a word.<br> -Well, I'll settle him.<br> -I'll go, Aunt Mary. I'll go.<br> I think maybe I can manage him.<br> Get along, get along, get along, little...<br> -Morning, miss.<br> -What do you think you're doing?<br> You can't stage a circus out here<br> in this front yard.<br> Well, I can't disappoint all these people<br> who've walked blocks<br> just to look me over, can l?<br> Well, you've given them<br> more now than they expected.<br> So unhitch that barking horse<br> and stop this nonsense.<br> I hope you've learned your lesson, Jake.<br> It's a disgrace to have a little fun<br> in Lynnfield and don't you forget it.<br> -Good morning, Mrs. Cobb.<br> -Good morning, Mrs. Cobb.<br> My, my, you've put on weight.<br> That's about enough from you,<br> Mr. Dewberry.<br> You and I are going in the back<br> and trim the rose bushes, understand?<br> Okay, lady. Giddyup, Jake.<br> Giddyup. Giddyup.<br> Keep your hands busy<br> and your eyes on your work.<br> And tell me,<br> how did you track me to Lynnfield?<br> -Homing instinct, like a pigeon.<br> -Tell me.<br> You left some papers on the floor<br> in your wild flight from my apartment.<br> -Pure accident.<br> -I see.<br> Well, now that you know everything<br> and you've had your little laugh,<br> why don't you get along?<br> It fascinates me.<br> Why don't you get away from this burg<br> and lead a natural life?<br> I'm happy right where I am.<br> No quaking rabbit was every happy.<br> And for a lovely woman with talent,<br> it's a sin.<br> Don't worry, lady, I'm going to break you<br> out of this jail and give you to the world.<br> You wouldn't be so low<br> as to tell my aunts and Lynnfield about me?<br> -No, you're going to do that yourself.<br> -Never.<br> That's the old Lynnfield spirit.<br> And tell me, what kind of berries are ripe<br> this time of year?<br> Blackberries. Why?<br> That's what you and I are<br> going to pick tomorrow.<br> Don't be silly. I can't go<br> skipping off to the woods with you.<br> It's the berries tomorrow.<br> What are you doing?<br> Who told you to take up that rose bush?<br> You're a gardener, are you?<br> Well, you're dismissed.<br> You've got your notice right now.<br> Now, Aunt Mary, you can't do that.<br> I told him to dig it up.<br> -Why?<br> -Well, I thought maybe...<br> Well, she was just saying<br> it ought to be transplanted.<br> And I was just saying as<br> how transplanting is very important.<br> You see, it's this way, Aunt Maria.<br> If you keep a rose bush<br> in one place too long,<br> it uses up all the nourishment<br> in that one little spot of ground.<br> And what happens? It stops growing.<br> Settles down to a dull existence.<br> And it's the same way with most people.<br> What they need occasionally is<br> new soil with new life in it.<br> -Hey, Jake!<br> -Sylvia!<br> Sylvia!<br> -Sylvia!<br> -Jake!<br> I thought you said you were a berry-picker?<br> And no cracks, you.<br> I'm just not used to bending over, that's all.<br> You're a wreck, Mr. Dewberry.<br> -You know what you need?<br> -No, what?<br> You need nourishment,<br> new soil, transplanting.<br> You're a nasty character.<br> Excuse me, I'm tired.<br> Well, what about some berries?<br> Well, they're right at your head. Dig in.<br> Drop them in my mouth.<br> Well, who's going to chew them for you?<br> Drop them way back<br> so they'll just slide down.<br> Sorry I have to trouble you to swallow.<br> That's all right.<br> -More.<br> -Want some more?<br> You ought to be ashamed of yourself<br> Iaughing like that,<br> right out loud and everything.<br> What would Lynnfield say?<br> Say, has anybody ever been<br> known to laugh in Lynnfield?<br> I think there is a case or two on record.<br> Well, then somebody<br> must have been tickling them.<br> You know, you're a strange, sad case, girlie.<br> Do you know that?<br> No. No, tell me, doctor.<br> Well, to begin with, you're really a nice gal.<br> Full of normal desires,<br> but I can tell you what's happening to them.<br> -What?<br> -They're being slowly strangled to death.<br> -Why, that's murder.<br> -No, suicide.<br> Everything Lynnfield doesn't<br> want you to feel you write about.<br> Love, laughter, all the things<br> you want to experience and can't.<br> Go on.<br> There's a happy world out yonder, girlie.<br> Break loose, be yourself.<br> Tell Lynnfield to go take a jump.<br> Can you imagine Aunt Mary taking a jump?<br> Well, it's the only way<br> you'll ever be a free happy soul.<br> Mind the old doctor. I know.<br> I had to go through the same thing.<br> Sure is tough to break away<br> from your family,<br> your background and be yourself.<br> They had it all fixed for me to settle down<br> in Papa's footsteps.<br> To be a banker and a statesman,<br> but I wanted to paint.<br> It was the battle of the century, but I won it.<br> I knew you would.<br> Yeah? Well, at least<br> I can call my soul my own. Do you?<br> No.<br> No, I don't. I really don't.<br> But I could with a little help<br> from you, doctor.<br> Just say the word, girlie.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> I want you to get out of Lynnfield<br> and stay out.<br> Then I'd be free and happy.<br> You see, Dr. Dewberry,<br> -my real life is right here.<br> -Yeah?<br> Caroline Adams was just an accident.<br> Pure accident. She won't write any more.<br> But, if anything should go wrong,<br> I'd be glad to call on you, doctor.<br> Your bedside manner is so charming.<br> I do appreciate it.<br> Listen, it's getting late<br> and I have to help with dinner.<br> Come on, grandpop, we've got to go.<br> Wipe off your face.<br> Come on, Jake.<br> -Goodbye.<br> -Now, wait a minute.<br> You may win as a berry-picker,<br> but wait until we go fishing<br> and then I'll show you a thing or two.<br> Wait till who goes fishing?<br> I thought I told you to leave.<br> Sure, sure, I'll leave. Now, let's see,<br> the best time to go fishing is<br> about 5:00 in the morning.<br> What we catch, we'll eat for breakfast.<br> Listen, I'll have a hard enough time<br> explaining this berry-picking.<br> You'd have a harder time explaining<br> about Caroline Adams, wouldn't you?<br> Shall we make it 4:30?<br> Now, then, just relax.<br> You'll never catch trout<br> if you're too anxious.<br> They can tell an amateur a mile off.<br> Now then, casting is an art.<br> You want your bait to describe a wide arc<br> and settle down gently on the water.<br> If you make a splash, you scare them away.<br> Well, here goes.<br> Now then, you watch closely.<br> You didn't catch anything.<br> Well, you don't catch a trout<br> every time you cast, little girl.<br> Have a try.<br> You mean like that?<br> That makes five for me.<br> You haven't caught any yet,<br> have you, Michael?<br> You know darn well I haven't.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> you were a crack fisherman?<br> Well, you didn't give me a chance.<br> You were so busy telling me<br> how good you were.<br> I don't think we ought to catch<br> any more than we can eat, do you?<br> -Want to have breakfast now?<br> -lf you'll invite me. They're your fish.<br> Come on. You're invited.<br> Come on, Jake.<br> -Come on, boy, get your breakfast.<br> -Hello, Jake. Hello, boy.<br> Do you like fish, Jake? Come on, boy.<br> When are you leaving town, Michael?<br> You know, I can really relax on fish.<br> It sits just right.<br> Not too heavy and not too light.<br> That rhymes. Not too heavy, not too light.<br> Eat more fish. Sits just right.<br> When are you leaving town?<br> -You said that.<br> -But you didn't answer me.<br> Well, to be serious about it, I don't know.<br> Well, when do you think?<br> Can't think on fish.<br> I inherit that from my grandpa.<br> Michael, stop poking at that fire.<br> Hey, what do you think you're doing?<br> I'm the Boy Scout here.<br> My eyes.<br> -Here, you goop.<br> -I'm blind.<br> Well, it serves you right.<br> Don't you know any better<br> -than to go playing with fire?<br> -Keep still, it hurts.<br> So would your finger<br> if you stuck it in a buzz saw.<br> It hurts something awful.<br> All right, all right. Don't cry now. Don't cry.<br> Papa will make it all better for you.<br> Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> See? All better?<br> Michael, I forgot it was Sunday.<br> Miss Wilson,<br> you look after the sale of tickets.<br> Mrs. Moffat will have charge<br> of the refreshments.<br> And Mrs. Cobb will take charge<br> of the clothing booth.<br> I'll manage the raffle.<br> -Rebecca, you will...<br> -I know.<br> Well, I guess there is only<br> one more thing to discuss.<br> That's what day we'll have our bazaar.<br> But before we go into that,<br> I think we'll have our tea and cake.<br> -Theodora.<br> -Yes, Aunt Mary.<br> Well, if you ask me, Mary,<br> there's just one thing to discuss<br> at this meeting.<br> That is the conduct of Theodora.<br> Rebecca, and all of you,<br> Theodora might make a few little mistakes<br> out of a generous impulse,<br> but she couldn't do anything sinful.<br> You know that, because you've known her<br> since she was a child.<br> So I won't have any aspersions cast.<br> Is that plain?<br> That isn't a true hexagon.<br> By the way, our gardener is leaving<br> in the morning.<br> -Michael.<br> -Well, come in.<br> I'm washing out my only shirt. Come in.<br> No, I can't. I've got to get back.<br> I just came over to say that...<br> What's he doing?<br> Who, Jake?<br> He's after the cheese in the mousetrap.<br> You came over to say what?<br> That you've got to leave, Michael.<br> I promised you'd go in the morning.<br> There was a quarrel about it yesterday.<br> It's really serious.<br> We can't joke about it anymore.<br> You've simply got to go.<br> -Hey, Jake. Jake. Come here, you fool.<br> -Jake.<br> Come here.<br> Come here, and let me take your foot out.<br> Come here, Jake. Come here. Oh, Jake.<br> Come here and let me take your foot out.<br> Haven't you got any more sense<br> than to go stick your foot in a mousetrap?<br> I don't think it's broken any. There.<br> Shall we go on with the meeting?<br> We're waiting for the tea, Theodora.<br> Theodora.<br> Well, why don't you ask me<br> what you want to know and get it over with?<br> Did I go out there<br> because I heard the dog yipping?<br> Or did I go out in the first place<br> to see the gardener?<br> The tea, Theodora.<br> You've all made up your minds<br> about it anyhow,<br> so I may as well tell you the truth.<br> I went out there to see him.<br> To tell him that I don't want him to go.<br> But he's got to go because you want him to.<br> -Theodora.<br> -lt doesn't matter what I want.<br> You're telling me what's good for me,<br> what's proper, what isn't proper.<br> You have been telling me that<br> since I was three years old and I'm sick of it.<br> You've glared and scolded<br> and frightened me all I'll stand for.<br> And now I'll tell you something.<br> I'll tell you something you'll never forget.<br> There's no law that can put that gardener<br> off these premises.<br> And he's going to stay right here.<br> This is a free country, I said.<br> I'm over 21, and what I choose to do<br> is none of Lynnfield's business.<br> I invite the whole town<br> to take a jump in the lake.<br> Swell.<br> That gardener's going to stay here<br> as long as I want him to, I said.<br> And that's forever, because I love him.<br> What's Lynnfield going to do about that?<br> I love him. I always will.<br> And there's nobody in this town<br> who's going to stop me.<br> Swell.<br> That's what I said, Michael.<br> It was the truth.<br> Swell.<br> I was thrilled to hear myself say it.<br> Right then I knew<br> I never could have sent you away.<br> Well, when you finally did let go,<br> you certainly rocked the world, didn't you?<br> I guess you and I have<br> a lot of things to talk about.<br> Yes, I guess we have.<br> We'd better not start tonight, though.<br> Are you proud of me, Michael?<br> I'll tell the world, baby.<br> Baby?<br> And Uncle John said nobody in Lynnfield<br> would ever call me baby.<br> Good night, darling.<br> Michael. Michael.<br> What? What?<br> -10:00, Mr. Grant.<br> -10:00? Well, what of it?<br> You know I didn't get to bed until 4:00.<br> Get out of here.<br> Your father telephone.<br> Say he be here at 10:00.<br> My father? Well, why didn't you wake me up?<br> I wake you, but you don't wake.<br> -Did you straighten up the living room?<br> -All fixed.<br> There he is now. Always on the dot.<br> Let him in, Toki.<br> Hello.<br> -Theodora.<br> -Hello, Michael.<br> Hello, Jake.<br> Well, here, let's do something about this.<br> Toki. Toki, take him out in the kitchen<br> and give him a bone. Have you got a bone?<br> No bone, but got nice lemon pie.<br> You forgot Jake. I thought you'd want him.<br> Why, yes, of course I want him.<br> Thanks very much.<br> And you want to know why I left that note<br> and ran away.<br> Theodora, writing that note<br> was the most difficult thing I ever did.<br> Oh, yes, the note.<br> I know you've got an explanation coming.<br> I ran away, because...<br> Because I threw myself at your head<br> and you were frightened.<br> No. Because I felt the same way about you.<br> You didn't know that, did you?<br> I didn't know it, either, until that night.<br> Until you stood there in my arms.<br> Then I knew I loved you.<br> If I'd had any idea that it was ever going<br> to be as serious as this,<br> I never would have gone to Lynnfield.<br> In view of my circumstances,<br> I had no right to go playing at hearts<br> with a swell person like you.<br> What circumstances, Michael?<br> Mr. Grant? Yes, you can come right up.<br> There he is now.<br> Please, I'd rather you didn't stay.<br> He can be a little difficult about some things.<br> Be a good girl now, run along to the Ritz<br> and I'll meet you there at 1:00 for lunch.<br> The Ritz? Where's the Ritz?<br> You mean to say<br> you don't know where the Ritz is?<br> Well, now, if you came to Lynnfield<br> and I said<br> to meet me in Willoughby's Meadow<br> for berry-picking,<br> you'd be a little confused, wouldn't you?<br> Theodora, you're stalling.<br> Why, Michael Grant, I'm not stalling.<br> Listen, do you know<br> what avenue you're on now?<br> No, I don't. Tell me about it.<br> Well, you're on Park Avenue...<br> How'd you get here if you didn't know?<br> Oh, homing instinct. Like a pigeon.<br> Now, please listen, Theodora.<br> You go right down Park Avenue,<br> then you turn to the right<br> until you come to Madison.<br> Oh, never mind. It's too late.<br> Will you please go in another room<br> or go sit down some place?<br> I'll go sit down some place.<br> -Hello, Father.<br> -Michael.<br> -Hello.<br> -Agnes.<br> Hello. I wasn't expecting you.<br> You disappoint me, Michael.<br> Running out of town without telling<br> your family anything about it.<br> Where were you?<br> Who's this?<br> Miss Lynn from the Stevenson Office.<br> She's brought material for drawings<br> that I'm to make.<br> My father, Miss Lynn.<br> -How do you do?<br> -How do you do, Mr. Grant?<br> -How do you do?<br> -How do you do? I'm Mrs. Grant.<br> Oh, yes. My wife, Miss Lynn.<br> Where did you say you were?<br> -ln the country, sketching.<br> -Very pretty.<br> He will sketch.<br> Did you drift back to town accidentally,<br> or did you remember that I'm giving<br> a reception for the governor on the 20th?<br> Of course I remembered.<br> And of course you'll be there with Agnes.<br> -With Agnes?<br> -With Agnes.<br> Now, look here, Father,<br> this pretense of a happy marriage<br> has gone on long enough.<br> It's been washed up for five years,<br> and I'm sure Agnes is just as sick of it<br> as I am.<br> If not sicker.<br> I thought it was agreed there would be<br> no divorce as long as I held public office.<br> If Agnes is agreeable,<br> I don't know what you're kicking about.<br> -Yes, I appreciate...<br> -You gave me your word.<br> And that's the way it's going to be.<br> You owe that much to the name of Grant.<br> Especially after your choice of a profession.<br> Now, you know<br> what's expected of you, Michael.<br> Come, Agnes.<br> -Good day, miss.<br> -Oh, goodbye.<br> I can scarcely wait<br> for the governor's reception, dear.<br> -Toki, bring me some coffee, black.<br> -Got some nice lemon pie.<br> Well, it's all clear now, isn't it?<br> You know something, Michael?<br> What you need is an artist's model.<br> -A what?<br> -An artist's model.<br> Why, I haven't the slightest use for a model.<br> Well, the right one<br> might be a great help to you.<br> -I don't want a model.<br> -Don't struggle, Michael, you've got one.<br> -Who?<br> -Me.<br> -What in heaven's name for?<br> -What for?<br> Certainly what for?<br> Well, to mow the lawn, transplant things,<br> a little plain and fancy whistling, you know...<br> Oh, I see. It's a joke.<br> That's very funny.<br> You mean I did some gardening for you<br> and so you're...<br> Yes, I'm going to return the favor<br> and do a little modeling for you.<br> -That's very funny.<br> -You see, you're living in a jail, too.<br> -You can't call your soul your own.<br> -Oh, come now.<br> Why, it's true.<br> Why, you're a clear sad case, my boy.<br> Tied to a woman you don't love.<br> And so afraid of Papa<br> you can't do anything about it.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> If you are trying to find any similarity<br> between your situation and mine,<br> oh, no, you couldn't mean that, really.<br> -Finally, your whole outlook was wrong.<br> -And yours?<br> Mine? Well, I'm simply in a position where...<br> Well, I was brought up<br> with pride of family, that's all,<br> -to respect the old boy.<br> -I see. And you love me, Michael?<br> You know I do. I meant every word I said.<br> And when I'm free, darling,<br> the world is ours.<br> And when will the world be ours, about?<br> Well, just give Pop time to serve his term<br> as Lieutenant Governor.<br> He won't run for office again, I'm sure.<br> That means that within two years...<br> Michael! Two years for people of our age<br> is a lifetime.<br> Oh, no. It may seem that way, Theodora...<br> Why, it's true. It's right.<br> Why, if you had any courage,<br> if your outlook were right, why, you could...<br> My, how you need a model.<br> Here, wait a minute, Theodora.<br> Will you please discuss this with me<br> like a normal human being?<br> -Well, just a moment, please.<br> -What are you going to do?<br> Hello, those boxes and things that were left<br> in the foyer downstairs.<br> Will you please send them up<br> to Mr. Michael Grant's apartment?<br> What boxes? What things?<br> Some new outfits I just bought.<br> Wait till you see them.<br> I've got hats. They sit on an angle like this,<br> I'm telling you.<br> And dresses,<br> I'm an open secret down to there.<br> Where's your tool house?<br> Theodora, exactly what do you think<br> you're going to do?<br> I'm just returning a favor, darling.<br> How? By moving in here<br> and breaking a scandal around my ears?<br> Oh, a scandal is all in the life of a model.<br> Theodora, either you're mad,<br> or you're fooling.<br> Listen to me.<br> I'm going to handle this in my own way.<br> If it takes two years, it'll take two years.<br> You're not going to force a situation<br> between me and my father and Agnes<br> by moving into this apartment.<br> Oh, I'm in. Oh, come in, boys, come right in.<br> Come right in, boys.<br> Put them down any place. Any place at all.<br> My, my! I didn't...<br> Oh, it's nice of you to come up.<br> Would you put it down there?<br> Oh, you're in, huh?<br> You're going to have things your own way?<br> Well, we'll see about that.<br> Toki, Miss Lynn is in.<br> Pack up my things. I'm out.<br> Why...<br> -Yes?<br> -Miss Adams. Miss Caroline Adams.<br> Yes, yes, of course.<br> How are you, my dear?<br> Fine.<br> Your mouth's open, Arthur.<br> Oh, I'm fine, too, thanks.<br> You might say, "ln the pink."<br> You can tell that, can't you? It cost enough.<br> But I didn't come here<br> to have a friendly visit.<br> I came here to have a fight.<br> I'm dissatisfied with the treatment<br> I'm getting from my publisher. I mean you.<br> In short, why don't I get<br> any publicity around here?<br> -Why, my dear Miss Adams...<br> -My dear Miss Adams. My dear Miss Adams.<br> Yes, you sit there and call me Miss Adams.<br> But who else knows I'm Caroline Adams?<br> Nobody.<br> The widest-selling author in the country<br> and nobody knows anything about me.<br> Has it never occurred to you<br> that the sale of my books<br> might jump enormously if it were known<br> that I'm fairly young and modern<br> and halfway respectable?<br> And if the facts were broadcast<br> about my life in Lynnfield,<br> don't you realize<br> what a story that would make?<br> -Well...<br> -No. No, obviously not.<br> It seems publishers don't care anything<br> about increasing the sale of their books.<br> Well, authors do. We've got to live.<br> A thing like this is darn expensive.<br> Now, I'll give you one more chance,<br> Mr. Stevenson Publishing Company.<br> I want publicity. I want a lot of it.<br> I want my picture on every jacket<br> of every book of mine that's sold.<br> And I want the story of Theodora Lynn<br> and Caroline Adams splattered<br> over every paper in every town in the Union.<br> Will you come in, please, Miss Baldwin?<br> And bring your book.<br> And, oh, one aspirin for Mr. Stevenson.<br> Or shall we make it two?<br> Holy smoke!<br> Hello. Hello. Bertha. Get me the Bugle.<br> Hurry up.<br> Jed? Jed, listen. Associated Press dispatch<br> to Lynnfield Bugle.<br> Wait a minute, Clarence. Yes. Yeah.<br> Yeah. No. Yeah.<br> Clarence, just a moment<br> until I catch my breath.<br> Boys, boys, now don't get excited.<br> Take it easy, take it easy.<br> Yes, hello, Clarence. Yes, go ahead. Yeah.<br> Yeah. No. No.<br> Yeah. Is that all?<br> Boys, do you remember that type we used<br> when war was declared?<br> Dust it off, boys. Dust it off. It's war.<br> War, I'm telling you, it's war.<br> Mary. Mary!<br> Mary!<br> It's war!<br> Civilization is marching on Lynnfield.<br> Oh, Theodora, I thank you.<br> I thank you. I thank you.<br> On every front page in New York<br> she's giving your address, your apartment.<br> How long before they'll know<br> it's your apartment?<br> Call the police and have her thrown out.<br> With all New York looking on?<br> That will be nice publicity<br> for the governor's reception.<br> You're marvelous, Michael.<br> Here is a notorious woman.<br> Did you read what she says about herself?<br> "Hidden away in a hamlet,<br> her soul enslaved."<br> -A woman leading a double life.<br> -lf not triple.<br> Yes. And you have to go up in the country<br> and get in the middle of it.<br> He was sketching it.<br> If this gets out, the governor will have fits.<br> Not to mention<br> the disgrace to the name of Grant.<br> You know, if this woman's really out<br> to break up our marriage, Michael,<br> maybe you and I ought to root for her.<br> You sit tight, Agnes, and do as you're told.<br> That'll be splendid, but let me say this.<br> If this woman really starts after Michael<br> and it's talked about all over town<br> and I'm made to look<br> like a foolish deceived wife,<br> I'll have to do something to save my face.<br> And I'll most certainly bring divorce action<br> against Michael immediately.<br> Did you hear that, Michael?<br> Yes.<br> -Pardon me.<br> -Pardon me.<br> -Pardon me.<br> -Pardon me.<br> -Pardon me.<br> -Pardon me.<br> -I beg your pardon.<br> -I beg yours, sir.<br> I have this to say<br> to the modern young girl, gentlemen,<br> be free, express yourself. Take your life<br> in your own hands and mold it.<br> The world will try to rob you<br> of your freedom,<br> but fight for it.<br> It's all you have to live for.<br> -Miss Adams.<br> -Just relax.<br> That's all for the modern girl, gentlemen.<br> What else? Ask me anything.<br> Have you started a new book, Miss Adams?<br> Well, no, I haven't.<br> But I have it pretty well in mind.<br> Well, would you care<br> to say something about it?<br> I'd love to. It's about how love came<br> to a girl in a small New England town.<br> Outwardly, she seemed to belong<br> to that narrow benighted little community,<br> but in her heart,<br> she longed to be called baby.<br> Out of the great big city,<br> there came to this little hamlet<br> the man who did call her baby.<br> From there on, gentlemen,<br> the story warms up.<br> -Oh, Miss Adams.<br> -Just relax, sister.<br> I haven't quite finished it yet,<br> but I guarantee it for interest,<br> if you know what I mean.<br> Would that be the story of your life,<br> Miss Adams?<br> -Oh, well, I shouldn't wonder.<br> -And who would the man be?<br> The man? Oh, now, come now, gentlemen.<br> A lady is entitled to one secret.<br> -Miss Adams.<br> -Just relax, and by the way, Miss Adams,<br> is this Michael Grant's apartment?<br> Michael Grant, did you...<br> Well, yes, this is Michael Grant's apartment.<br> I was just getting to that.<br> It's a very interesting story, gentlemen.<br> Uncle John, Uncle John, come in.<br> Mr. John Lynn, the gentlemen of the press.<br> Uncle limps a little with the gout.<br> Brought it on himself.<br> The only Lynn I'm proud of.<br> Theodora, may I have<br> a word in private with you?<br> Oh, certainly.<br> I'm afraid that's all for today, gentlemen.<br> But what about Grant and this apartment?<br> You were going to tell us<br> the story about that.<br> Has Grant anything to do with the big bad<br> man from the city who called you baby?<br> Well, now, couldn't we save that<br> until tomorrow?<br> But don't be far off, will you?<br> Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.<br> Now, if you please, Miss Adams.<br> Didn't you hear me say that I wanted to<br> have a private word with my niece?<br> -I beg your pardon.<br> -I beg yours.<br> How's tricks, Uncle?<br> Come on, snooksie. Get up.<br> Go on, run along, boy. Sit down.<br> Theodora, you're terrific.<br> It's just about what you'd planned for me,<br> isn't it, darling?<br> You exceed my wildest hopes.<br> Do you know what your aunts wired?<br> Those two delightful old relics? No. What?<br> "Theodora's gone wild."<br> -Tut, tut, I haven't started.<br> -Now just tell me this.<br> -ls everything all right?<br> -Fine.<br> -Feet on the ground?<br> -Both feet.<br> I knew it.<br> A Lynn may go wild, but never silly.<br> Now, do you mind telling<br> your nosey old uncle<br> what made all this happen?<br> What makes the world go round, darling?<br> Say no more. I think I just saw the rascal.<br> That's the guy that banged the door<br> on the way out.<br> Oh, he'll come back. How's Adelaide?<br> It's about time to send her up to that home.<br> Oh, then she's going this week.<br> And I'm going to tell that funny little<br> old husband of hers<br> that he's going to be a papa.<br> Good.<br> Now, how about us going out<br> and painting the town red?<br> I'm ready and raring to go.<br> When do we start?<br> That's the next thing on the program.<br> It's true that at present Miss Adams<br> is residing in my apartment.<br> But in case you're tempted to publish<br> any conclusion<br> regarding my relationship with Miss Adams,<br> let me warn you...<br> Please be advised.<br> Please be advised that I have never had<br> the pleasure of meeting the lady.<br> Having never been in Lynnfield in my life.<br> I think that's smart in case they try<br> to tie me up with that<br> -"man who came and called her baby" story.<br> -Very good.<br> And furthermore, the only thing<br> I have in common with Miss Adams<br> is our friendship with Mr. Arthur Stevenson.<br> During a recent fishing trip,<br> Mr. Stevenson wired me and asked<br> if Miss Adams could have the use<br> of my apartment while she was in New York.<br> I was more than glad to accommodate.<br> Paragraph. The above facts can be verified<br> by telephoning Mr. Arthur Stevenson.<br> All right, Miss Baldwin.<br> Get that out to the papers<br> and all the news services as fast as you can.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I could kill that woman<br> with my two bare hands.<br> Excuse my laughing, Michael.<br> I know this is very tragic to you<br> and your magnificent family.<br> But it's awfully funny to me.<br> -What's awfully funny?<br> -Yes, what's so funny about it?<br> Why, here's this carefree rollicking spirit<br> who's been going around for years<br> sticking his nose in everybody's business<br> and now he's finally got it caught<br> in a meat grinder.<br> Yeah. Very funny.<br> See that your nose doesn't<br> get caught in it, my pet.<br> Who, me? Why, what are you talking about?<br> It's all perfectly clear to me.<br> That adorable young thing<br> is an unholy terror on wheels.<br> There's nothing in the world more deadly<br> than innocence on the manhunt.<br> Why, sweetheart,<br> you don't think for one minute...<br> No, I'm telling you, my love.<br> You get on guard and stay on guard.<br> On account of little Ethie won't stand<br> for any fancy steps from her ducky-wucky.<br> You get funnier by the minute, darling.<br> -Hello.<br> -Hello, Arthur angel.<br> I've got full steam up<br> and you're my only hope for the evening.<br> Uncle caved in<br> and Michael is off moping somewhere.<br> Hello, Mr. Green.<br> There's someone there.<br> That's right, dear, don't give us away.<br> Shall we say 7:30 for dinner?<br> Why, I haven't had a chance<br> to read that contract yet, Mr. Green.<br> I'm afraid I couldn't discuss it<br> with you tonight.<br> Well, I might suggest tomorrow<br> sometime during the day.<br> Oh, but it's got to be tonight, sugarfoot.<br> Because otherwise<br> I'll find myself another publisher<br> and then you might lose<br> your very best little writer.<br> Yes, yes, goodbye, Mr. Green.<br> Yes. That was Mr. Green.<br> Theo, you wouldn't leave me<br> and go to another publisher, would you?<br> No. No, Arthur. No, I wouldn't dream of it.<br> I wouldn't leave you. Come on.<br> -Here's your house.<br> -No, this is your house.<br> No, it's your house. But I want to see<br> that you get upstairs all right.<br> -Can I help you, lady?<br> -No, I think I can manage somehow.<br> Say, you can't take her away from me.<br> I'm a better publisher than you are.<br> I don't know<br> what you're talking about, mister.<br> If you'll just put your arm<br> around my shoulder and lean on me.<br> That's right. Don't dream of it.<br> If some other publisher comes to you<br> and tries to take you away from me,<br> makes you a big offer, you just come to me.<br> I'll do better, see?<br> Yes, I will. I will.<br> If you leave me, Theo, the House<br> of Stevenson would just fall to pieces.<br> -Arthur, I wouldn't.<br> -You can't leave me, Theo.<br> You gotta reconsider.<br> That's the thanks I get. I discover you,<br> I make you famous, you leave me flat.<br> -I'll stay with you forever, Arthur.<br> -I know. The old knife in the back stuff.<br> Listen, listen, how much did he offer you?<br> I'll double it. Tell me?<br> Tomorrow. Tomorrow.<br> Where's your key, Arthur?<br> -Where's your key, Arthur?<br> -Where's your key?<br> -Oh, this is...<br> -ls this it? 805?<br> -No. 805.<br> -All right, all right.<br> Now, look. You let me get to the elevator,<br> then you press the bell.<br> Okay.<br> -Good night, Arthur.<br> -No, Theo, you can't do that to me.<br> -You've gotta stay with me.<br> -No, no.<br> No. Listen, Theo,<br> ask me whatever you want and it's yours,<br> only don't leave me.<br> Oh, good evening.<br> Oh, hello, Ethie. Hi.<br> Cheese and crackers.<br> I got it, Clarence. I got it.<br> Sam. Henry. Clear the whole front page.<br> Okay, Clarence, I got it.<br> "Theodora named in divorce action."<br> Disgusting.<br> "Theodora, the other woman,<br> in suit brought by wife of publisher."<br> "Charges misconduct<br> "between Theodora Lynn<br> and publisher of Adams' books."<br> Her publisher.<br> Did you see this brazen picture of her?<br> Lynnfield's daughter<br> is burning up the big town.<br> Small-town girl in big-time scandal.<br> How long is this kind of sinfulness<br> going to make up<br> the principal reading matter<br> for our children and the whole community?<br> -How long?<br> -Yes, how long?<br> Ask Theodora.<br> If you aren't satisfied with the answer,<br> stop Jed Waterbury from printing it.<br> But you wouldn't do that, because<br> this community is too all-fired nosey.<br> You couldn't stand not knowing<br> what's going on.<br> It's making us just a little sick of Lynnfield.<br> As long as I can remember,<br> this town's always wanted to know<br> what's cooking in the Lynn pot.<br> I think that's about all, Rebecca.<br> Well, I hope you're satisfied.<br> You've blasted Ethel's life to bits.<br> Don't be silly, sweetheart.<br> Ethel understands.<br> She telephoned this morning and said<br> the divorce action would be withdrawn.<br> -Come on in, and make yourself at home.<br> -No, Theodora.<br> Do you realize that you're getting yourself<br> the worst possible kind of a reputation?<br> -Oh, then you do care, Michael?<br> -Stay right where you are. Go on.<br> Keep your hands busy.<br> Keep on playing the piano.<br> Theodora, listen to me, if you make any<br> scandal before the governor's reception...<br> Theodora, please get out of town<br> until that reception's over.<br> That's all I ask of you.<br> If you do, I'll do anything.<br> I'll come up to Lynnfield<br> and talk to you within a month,<br> only please get out.<br> You're making my life miserable.<br> That's the struggle that's going on<br> within you, Michael.<br> But don't you worry.<br> The light breaks suddenly.<br> And then you'll rise up and tell Papa<br> what I told Lynnfield.<br> And then you'll be so happy.<br> I'll be happy when I'm darn<br> good and ready to be happy<br> and not a minute sooner.<br> -Michael. Michael.<br> -Stay right where you are.<br> All right, Michael, look at me.<br> Tell me, do we still have to wait two years?<br> Theodora, why can't you<br> be just a little reasonable?<br> -Who's that?<br> -I don't know.<br> -Oh, yes, the reporters.<br> -The reporters?<br> Yes. Come on, Michael. Now is your chance<br> to make a declaration of independence.<br> And tell them all about us right now.<br> -Never. If you tell them my name...<br> -ls Miss Adams in?<br> -Hello. How are you, Miss Adams?<br> -Hello.<br> Who's this?<br> The name's Brown, you snoops.<br> Montmorency Brown. Undertaker.<br> His Excellency, Governor Wyatt,<br> and Mrs. Wyatt.<br> -Good evening, Mrs. Wyatt.<br> -How do you do?<br> -How are you, Michael?<br> -Good evening, Governor.<br> -How do you do, Michael?<br> -Governor.<br> -Still painting, eh?<br> -I'm afraid so.<br> Pity he isn't a statesman isn't it, Governor?<br> Painter? Statesman? Same thing.<br> Get your hands dirty at both.<br> Seems to me Michael Grant<br> figured in the papers lately somehow.<br> I can't for the life of me recall the incident.<br> Oh, you don't mean in the story about<br> that terrible woman, do you, Mrs. Wyatt?<br> Yes, that's it.<br> Didn't she have your apartment?<br> -What woman's that?<br> -Oh, some awful woman novelist.<br> With quite a private reputation, Governor.<br> Well, well.<br> Of course, I've never had<br> the pleasure of meeting the lady.<br> You see, while I was on a fishing trip,<br> I received a wire from Mr. Arthur Stevenson,<br> my publisher,<br> asking if she could have the use of my<br> apartment during her visit to New York.<br> Of course, I was more than glad<br> to accommodate.<br> And then, well, you know the newspapers.<br> I hope steps were taken<br> to clear this up, Jonathan.<br> Certainly, Stephen, certainly.<br> Your father and I have been very careful<br> to keep this administration clean, my boy.<br> Yes, yes, I'm sure of that, sir.<br> -May I have this dance, Mrs. Wyatt?<br> -Oh, delighted.<br> Oh, Stephen, may I remind you<br> that there are 100 women<br> just palpitating to dance with you?<br> Well, if I must, I must. Shall we?<br> Thank you.<br> Very starchy party.<br> Well, I guess now we start following<br> glad-hand Steve around<br> and recording<br> the governor's moments of play.<br> Boys will be boys.<br> Couldn't you smile just once<br> for the sake of appearance?<br> Charming.<br> Suppose you try it.<br> Angelic.<br> Isn't this a lovely party, Jonathan?<br> Oh, you dance divinely, Governor.<br> -Thank you, Miss...<br> -Adams.<br> -lt can't be.<br> -And she snagged the governor.<br> You're a splendid dancer, too, Miss Adams.<br> -Oh, Governor.<br> -Yes, indeed.<br> Pardon me, Governor.<br> Do you mind, Governor? Smile. Thank you.<br> Thanks.<br> -Pardon me, please. Hold it.<br> -Thank you, Governor.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> -Charming, Governor, perfectly charming.<br> -Why, thank you, thank you.<br> -Tell me quick, is that the woman?<br> -ln person.<br> This is terrible.<br> Michael, in five minutes, everybody<br> in this house will know who she is.<br> They've already got a picture of her<br> with the governor.<br> I'll take care of that.<br> You see that she gets out of this house.<br> Take her out into the garden<br> or on the terrace, anywhere,<br> and keep her there<br> for the rest of the evening.<br> Hush, Jonathan.<br> Well, well. A delightful party.<br> I have just had the most fascinating dance.<br> Allow me to present Miss...<br> -Adams.<br> -Yes, yes, Miss Adams.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan Grant.<br> -How do you do?<br> -How do you do?<br> -How do you do?<br> -And the Michael Grants.<br> -How do you do?<br> -So nice, Miss Adams.<br> How do you do?<br> It is a delightful party, isn't it?<br> I don't know when<br> I've enjoyed myself so much.<br> -And the governor dances divinely.<br> -Thank you. Thank you.<br> Give me a charming lady to dance<br> with and, well, I'm young again.<br> Well, there we are again, Miss Adams.<br> May I have the pleasure of this dance,<br> Miss Adams?<br> Young blood trying to force<br> an old boy on the sidelines?<br> You may not have this dance, my boy.<br> It's mine.<br> Miss Adams is my discovery<br> and I am going to keep her.<br> Keep an eye out for my wife, please.<br> -Well?<br> -Leave it to me.<br> -Oh, I'm sorry.<br> -Oh, it's quite all right. Quite all right.<br> -Governor, you are very cruel.<br> -How so?<br> Well, I'm simply expiring to dance with you<br> and you've no use for me whatever.<br> The next one is yours, my dear.<br> Well, I'm afraid I can't wait, Governor.<br> Would you mind very much?<br> Well, naturally I would,<br> but then of course I know just how you feel.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Do you remember this tune, Mr. Grant?<br> Shall I sing it and you whistle?<br> If you so much as open your mouth...<br> How did you get in here?<br> Well, now, if that isn't the funniest thing.<br> You know, I said to myself,<br> "l bet Michael is going to ask me<br> how I got in here."<br> How did you get in here?<br> Michael, dear, this is hardly the place.<br> Will you tell me?<br> Well, the Stevensons had invitations<br> and decided not to come.<br> -So I just said to myself...<br> -Come on out here.<br> -That's my elbow.<br> -It's too bad it isn't your neck.<br> -Would you mind, Mr. Grant?<br> -No, no.<br> I'd be delighted. Is this all right?<br> I'm sorry. I've just met the lady with whom<br> I've been connected so much in the papers<br> and I'd like to make her acquaintance.<br> I'd also like the privacy of the garden<br> for a few moments, if you don't mind.<br> -Go right ahead.<br> -It's your garden. Go ahead.<br> Don't catch cold.<br> You're here to start something.<br> What are you here to do?<br> -Do?<br> -Don't tell me.<br> Wherever you are these days,<br> something happens.<br> Why, Michael.<br> Now listen to me, Theodora,<br> if you cause any scandal here tonight,<br> I'll never speak to you again in this lifetime.<br> That also goes if you aren't out<br> of this house in two minutes.<br> It also goes if you aren't out of my apartment<br> and outside of New York in two days.<br> Is that clear?<br> -Do you mean all that big speech?<br> -I mean every word of it.<br> -That I'm to go back to Lynnfield?<br> -To Lynnfield.<br> -And wait?<br> -And wait.<br> Then this is goodbye, Michael?<br> Yes, but there's no need to go to pieces,<br> especially here.<br> Oh, I'm all right. I'll go. I'll go back.<br> But I would like to have something<br> to remember you by.<br> -Sure. Sure, anything.<br> -A kiss?<br> Not here. When I see you off,<br> I'll come down to the train.<br> -But you won't. You'll be afraid.<br> -No. Yes, I will.<br> -Well, you won't.<br> -But I will.<br> Thank you, Miss Adams.<br> Why, you lowlife sneaks.<br> You dirty, double-crossing...<br> If you print that picture,<br> I'll break your necks.<br> If you print that picture, I'll skin you alive.<br> I'll track you down to the...<br> And as for you, if I ever said I loved you...<br> What's going on here?<br> The notorious Caroline Adams, novelist,<br> in the arms of my husband.<br> -Who?<br> -Yes, that's right. Isn't that nice?<br> Jed, this is hot.<br> "Mrs. Michael Grant sues for divorce,<br> branding Caroline Adams love thief."<br> Henry, we use the red ink on this one.<br> Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,<br> oh, boy, oh, boy.<br> Yes, siree. Hot diggety dog.<br> -Two in a row.<br> -Pride of Lynnfield.<br> The brazen hussy.<br> I only hope that Mary and Elsie<br> are bearing up. That's all I hope.<br> Jed. Jed.<br> Shoot. What now?<br> Associated dispatch.<br> "Caroline Adams vanishes."<br> What? You don't mean it.<br> -Rebecca.<br> -Rebecca.<br> No trace of Lynnfield's famous daughter<br> in seven days.<br> John, stop your gabbing, John.<br> Do you know where Theodora is<br> or don't you?<br> Why, I'm surprised you even bother<br> about Theodora.<br> After all her scandalous behavior.<br> What's so scandalous about it?<br> Fine time for a wild old buzzard like you<br> to turn moral. Hypocrite.<br> The old skate.<br> Elsie, where do you suppose she is?<br> Have you seen the baby?<br> Yes, he's a whopper. A face like a full moon.<br> Thanks for coming up, Theodora.<br> Oh, don't be silly. I had nothing else to do.<br> I brought someone with me.<br> He's standing right outside the door.<br> Your baby's papa. Roger.<br> Go on, stupid. Go on.<br> Lynn, Miss Lynn.<br> "Plan to arrive Saturday on the 10:15. Love."<br> What do you know about that?<br> Well, who's it from, idiot?<br> Theodora. Theodora.<br> Clarence, this is a private telegram.<br> Don't go spreading it<br> to the whole of Lynnfield.<br> Me? Why, I'm surprised at you, Mary Lynn.<br> Oh, we'll welcome her, all right.<br> I for one am going to stay right indoors<br> and pull down my blinds.<br> And when she finds herself<br> coming into an empty depot,<br> I hope she'll understand<br> she isn't wanted in Lynnfield.<br> We have the solemn word<br> of every man, woman and child in Lynnfield<br> that nobody will set foot<br> in the direction of that depot.<br> How are you, Harry? Hello, Eddie. Great day.<br> The decorations are nice,<br> don't you think, Mary?<br> Only there ain't enough of them.<br> How are you, Elsie Lynn, Mary Lynn?<br> How are the two oracles?<br> Let me shake hands with you.<br> -Nice day, Jed.<br> -Greatest day in the world, Mary.<br> Great day for Lynnfield.<br> Great day for Lynnfield.<br> Quite a turnout, eh?<br> You know,<br> I always knew Theodora had it in her.<br> How do you do? How do you do?<br> How do you do? How do you do?<br> Well, I got to thinking it might be better<br> to come and just stare at her.<br> Till she drops through the ground<br> for shame.<br> Well, look who's here.<br> Lynnfield's Literary Circle.<br> Jed, Jed Waterbury,<br> who brought this band here?<br> I did, Rebecca Perry.<br> Now you get a lawyer and try to stop me<br> from spending my own money any way I like.<br> Here she comes, lads, here she comes.<br> On your toes. On your toes. Now watch me.<br> Let 'er go!<br> Welcome home, Theodora. Welcome home.<br> Suffering cats.<br> -Where did she get it, Grandma?<br> -You go home and stay home.<br> On your toes, me lads, on your toes.<br> You'd think they'd never seen<br> a baby in their lives.<br> So help me Hannah. This town gets<br> more narrow-minded every day.<br> He is darling, isn't he, Aunt Mary?<br> -It's all right, Adelaide.<br> -Are you sure?<br> Sure. Nobody will see us.<br> Oh, so you're bored, sissy?<br> Well, snap out of it!<br> She'll be here in a minute.<br> Come on. Come on, get up here.<br> Get up here and let's rehearse our speech.<br> Now listen, you're Theodora and I'm Michael.<br> Theodora, darling.<br> Theodora, darling, I am free and I thank you.<br> I've never met so many people in all my life.<br> Theodora, we are free...<br> Michael. Michael.<br> Michael.<br> Michael, wait a minute.<br> -No, you don't. Shut the door.<br> -Michael!<br> Michael, what's the matter with you?<br> Michael. Michael. Michael.<br> How can you be so... Michael!<br> How do you expect me to be when<br> I come back and find something like that?<br> -Wait a minute.<br> -Don't say "Michael."<br> Talk about cutting loose.<br> You certainly cut loose<br> when you got to New York.<br> Let me out of here, will you, please?<br> -Michael, it isn't mine, you stupid.<br> -Oh, no?<br> No. It's Adelaide Perry's.<br> It's yours, Grandma.<br> Rebecca.<br> Michael, you idiot.<br>
