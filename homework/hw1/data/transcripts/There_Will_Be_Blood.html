It's a goat farm.<br> I told you: nothing grows but weeds.<br> -Is there water?<br> -It's salty.<br> You drill a well, it's hard not to get salt water.<br> The oil is there.<br> I'm telling you.<br> -I want to go now, so...<br> -You can stay tonight.<br> No. I wanna go now.<br> I wanna leave.<br> Listen, Paul.<br> If I travel all the way up there and I find that you'd been lying to me...<br> I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna<br> take more than my money back.<br> Is that alright with you?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -All right then.<br> -Nice luck to you. God bless.<br> -And to you, young man.<br> There's someone coming.<br> Good evening.<br> Good evening.<br> My name is Daniel Plainview.<br> This is my son HW.<br> Are you hunting?<br> Hunting for quail.<br> We were told there might be...<br> ...a good place to camp up near the Sunday ranch.<br> This is the Sunday ranch.<br> You can camp here.<br> -Thank you. Do you have water?<br> -Yes.<br> We heard there was an earthquake<br> up here a few days ago is that right?<br> Yes.<br> -Your family?<br> -Yeah, all fine, thank you.<br> We have goats milk if you'd like.<br> That'd be fine.<br> If we set our tent away over there<br> we'd be out of your way over there.<br> That's fine.<br> Ruth, help these men and<br> bring them some water.<br> No, H.W.<br> Mr. Plainview<br> - would you like that milk now?<br> -That'd be fine.<br> -Mary, bring them some milk.<br> My family will help you set up your tent.<br> No, please.

Dad, look at my shoe.<br> That's earthquake oil set loose.<br> -So... -So?<br> If there's anything here, we take it to the sea.<br> What we do is - we build a pipeline to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula...<br> ...it's about a 100 miles...<br> and we do a deal with union Oil.<br> This is what we do...<br> ...and we don't need the railroads and<br> the shipping costs anymore, you see?<br> -Yeah.<br> -You see that?<br> Yeah.<br> And then we're making money.<br> we're making the real money...<br> ...that we should be making and<br> not just throwing it away on shipping costs.<br> Otherwise it's just mud.<br> How much we gonna pay them?<br> Who's that?<br> The Sunday family.<br> We're not gonna give them the oil prices.<br> We keep them quail prices.<br> A few minutes, there's something I<br> very much like to talk with you about.<br> Mother would you take the girls outside, please.<br> I believe in plain speaking.<br> This is a beautiful ranch.<br> I love hunting for quail.<br> My boy has been sick, you know.<br> He needs fresh air.<br> Doctors all say he needs plentiful fresh air.<br> What would you say would be<br> a fair price for this lot, Abel?<br> -To buy this place?<br> -That's right.<br> Take a moment.<br> -I'm sorry, I don't know.<br> -Six dollars an acre.<br> Six dollars. Thank you, Eli.<br> And with the improvements to the ranch over the use at 500 dollars...<br> I'd like to offer you 3700 dollars for this ranch. That's $3700.<br> -No.<br> -The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.<br> Yes, I believe he has.<br> My offer to you is 3700 dollars.<br> What is it that brought you here, sir?<br> The good Lord's guidance.<br> And of course within that we're<br> gonna develop a lease.<br> -What's that?<br> -What about our oil?<br> -What about it?<br> -We have oil here, that's worth something.<br> Do you have someone who can drill for it?<br> Do you think there's oil here?<br> -I know there is.<br> -It's very expensive to drill.<br> To get it up and out of the ground.<br> Have you ever tried that before?<br> -How much is it?<br> -Costly.<br> Well, our oil sits right up on top of the ground.<br> I believe that's gold seepage,<br> doesn't necessarily mean there's anything underneath it.<br> -What would you give us for it?<br> -I don't know.<br> -Something you don't know?<br> -That's right.<br> What would you like, Eli?<br> Ten thousand dollars.<br> -For what?<br> -For my church.<br> That's good.<br> That's a good one.<br> If we decide to drill for oil...<br> ...if the well begins to produce...<br> ...I'll give your Church a 5,000 dollar signing bonus.<br> Do you wanna find someone else that's<br> gonna come up here and drill? Eli?<br> Make the investment and do all the hard work...<br> ...that goes into it?<br> I can just as easily hunt for quail on<br> another ranch as I can here.<br> Though I happily be a supporter<br> of your Church for as long as I can.<br> For the bonus only.<br> As it happens,<br> I do have some connections in the drilling business...<br> ...who might help get us started.<br> How do you feel about this, Abel?<br> Yes. What Eli says.<br> Well. Good.

You're not my son.<br> And you never have been, you're an orphan.<br> Did you ever hear that word?<br> Tell him what I said.<br> You've operated here today like one.<br> I should have seen this coming.<br> I should have known that<br> under this all, these past years...<br> ...you've been building your<br> hate for me, piece by piece...<br> ...I don' t even know who you are<br> because you have none of me in you...<br> You're someone else's.<br> This anger, your maliciousness and<br> backwards dealing with me...<br> ...you're an orphan from a basket<br> in the middle of the desert...<br> ...and I took you for no other reason than<br> I needed a sweet face to buy land.<br> Did you get that?<br> And now you know.<br> Look at me.<br> You're lower than a bastard.<br> You have none of me in you.<br> You're just bastard from a basket.<br> I think God, I have known you in me.<br> Not my son.<br> Just little piece of competition.<br> Bastard from a basket.<br> Bastard from a basket.<br> You're a bastard from a basket!<br> Brother Daniel, it's Eli.<br> -Yes it is, yes it is. -I'll make us a drink.<br> Your home is a miracle.<br> It's beautiful.<br> God bless it.<br> I've been spreading His word far and wide.<br> Far and wide.<br> So much travel for Him.<br> I've been working in radio.<br> Yes, so much, so much has been happening...<br> ...to be here and find you and<br> see you well is wonderful...<br> ...and we have a chance to catch up.<br> No, thank you so much.<br> My Brother.<br> Daniel, my Brother, by marriage.<br> We're such old friends.<br> So much time.<br> Things go up, things go down<br> but at least the Lord...<br> ...is always around.<br> We've seen ups and downs, haven't we?<br> Are things down for you right now, Eli?<br> No, no.<br> But I do come with some sad news:<br> Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?<br> Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.<br> He lived to be 99 years old.<br> God bless him.<br> Mr. Bandy has a grandson.<br> Have you met his grandson William?<br> William Bandy is one of the finest members...<br> ...we have at the Church of the Third Revelation.<br> He is eager to come to<br> Hollywood to be in movies.<br> He is very good looking.<br> And I do think he will have success.<br> That's wonderful.<br> Would you like me to speak with him?<br> Daniel...<br> ...I'm asking if you'd like to<br> have business with the Church...<br> ...of the Third Revelation in developing this lease...<br> ...on young Bandy's thousand acre tract.<br> I'm offering you to drill on one of...<br> ...the great un-developed fields of Little Boston!<br> I'd be happy to work with you.<br> Yes, yes of course. That's wonderful.<br> But there is one condition for this work.<br> All right.<br> I'd like you to tell me that you are a False Prophet.<br> I'd like you to tell me that you are...<br> ...and have been, a False Prophet...<br> ...and that God is a superstition.<br> But that's a lie.<br> It's a lie. I cannot say it.<br> When can we begin to drill?<br> Very soon.<br> How long will it take to bring in the well?<br> That shouldn't take long.<br> I would like a one hundred<br> thousand dollar signing bonus...<br> ...plus the five that is owed to me with interest.<br> That's only fair.<br> I am a false prophet and God is a superstition.<br> If that's what you believe, then I will say it.<br> Say it like you mean it.<br> Daniel...<br> Say it like it's your sermon.<br> Don't smile.<br> I am a false prophet and God is a superstition.<br> Why don't you stand up.<br> Put your glass down.<br> I am a false prophet and God is a superstition.<br> Eli, Eli, stop.<br> Just imagine this is your church here and you have a full congregation.<br> I am a false prophet and God is a superstition!<br> Say it again.<br> I am a false prophet and God is a superstition!<br> I can't hear you. Back!<br> I am a false prophet and God is a superstition!<br> Say it again.<br> I am a false prophet and God is a superstition!<br> Say it again.<br> I am a false prophet and God is a superstition!<br> Those area's have been drilled.<br> What?<br> Those area's have been drilled.<br> No they haven't.<br> Yes, it's...<br> It's called drainage,Eli.<br> I own everything around it...<br> ...so of course I get what's underneath it.<br> But there are no derricks there.<br> This is the Bandy tract. Do you understand?<br> Do you understand, Eli?<br> That's more to the point.<br> Do you understand?<br> I drink your water.<br> I drink it up.<br> Everyday. I drink the blood of<br> lamb from Bandy's tract.<br> You can sit down again.<br> Oh Daniel.<br> Please.<br> -I'm in desperate times.<br> -I know.<br> -I need a friend.<br> -Yes, of course you do.<br> I've sinned, I need help, I'm a sinner...<br> I've let the Devil grab hold of me<br> in ways I never imagined.<br> I'm so full of sin.<br> The Lord sometimes challenges us,<br> doesn't he?<br> Oh yes he does...<br> -Daniel. Yes he does aaaaaaaaa!<br> -Yes he does aaaa!<br> He's completely failed to alert me<br> to the recent panic in our economy...<br> ...and this.<br> I must have this, Daniel. I must have this.<br> My investments have...<br> Daniel, I won' t bore you, but if...<br> ...I could grab the Lords hand for help, I would...<br> ...but he does these things all the time...<br> ...these mysteries that he presents<br> and while we wait...<br> ...while we wait for his word.<br> You're not the chosen brother, Eli.<br> It was Paul who was chosen.<br> He found me and he told me about your land.<br> You're just a fraud.<br> -Why are you talking about Paul?<br> -I did what your brother couldn't.<br> I broke you and I beat you.<br> It was Paul...<br> ...who told me about you. He's the prophet.<br> He's the smart one.<br> He knew what was there and he found me<br> to take it out of the ground.<br> You know what the funny thing is? Listen, listen...<br> I paid him $10,000 cash in hand.<br> Just like that.<br> He has his own company now.<br> A prosperous little business,<br> three wells producing $5,000 a week.<br> Stop crying you sniveling ass.<br> Stop your nonsense.<br> You're just the afterbirth, Eli.<br> The slithered out on your mother's filth.<br> They should have put you in a<br> glass jar on a mantelpiece.<br> Where were you when Paul was<br> suckling at his mother's tit?<br> Where were you?<br> Who was nursing you, poor Eli?<br> With a bandaged side.<br> That land has been had.<br> Nothing you can do about it.<br> -It's gone, it's had. You loose.<br> -If you would just take this lease, Daniel.<br> Drainage! Drainage, Eli! You boy...<br> Drained dry, I'm so sorry.<br> If you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake...<br> ...and I have a straw, there it is that's a straw,<br> you see. Watch it.<br> And my straw reaches across the room...<br> ...and starts to drink your milkshake.<br> I drink your milkshake!<br> I drink it up!<br> Don't bully me Daniel.<br> Did you think that your song and dance...<br> ...and your superstition would help you, Eli?<br> I am the Third Revelation!<br> I am who the Lord has chosen!<br> Because I'm smarter than you.<br> I'm older...<br> I'm your old friend, Daniel!<br> I'm not a false prophet,<br> you sniveling boy!<br> I am the Third Revelation!<br> I am the Third Revelation!<br> I told you I would eat you!<br> I told you I would eat you up!<br> We're brothers! We're brothers!<br> Daniel, please forgive me.<br> I beg you for this.<br>
