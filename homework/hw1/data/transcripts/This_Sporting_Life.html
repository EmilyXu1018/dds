Whiskey?<br> Whiskey, Bob.<br> Phillips from the City Guardian.<br> You needn't take it seriously.<br> Why not?<br> It's only a game, old sport,<br> for Weaver's benefit.<br> They act like that for Weaver?<br> It's his or Slomer's cash<br> they're dishing out.<br> If Slomer hates you, Weaver'll<br> buy you out of spite.<br> You got a bruise coming.<br> Aye.<br> Weaver wouldn't have you<br> up to say ta-ta.<br> Frank.<br> What will you do<br> if we don't sign up?<br> Don't know.<br> Carry on as I am.<br> Change your mind about<br> splitting payment?<br> No.<br> No, 1.000 down.<br> There's nothing else for it.<br> You're not going to sign me?<br> That's it, we'll have to.<br> Congratulations, Frank.<br> Congratulations, Frank.<br> Hold it.<br> Aren't you going to read it?<br> Aye.<br> Don't spend it all at once now.<br> What does it feel like now?<br> I don't feel much.<br> It's all a bit quick. That's my fault.<br> I like to get things settled.<br> I suppose you don't mind.<br> Not now, I don't.<br> Did you have other offers?<br> No, at least<br> I didn't hear anything.<br> If you do, you'll know what to say.<br> Property of the City.<br> Best to make sure.<br> Fairfax Street. That rings a bell.<br> Hammond used to live there.<br> He got killed at your place.<br> Weaver's.<br> I've got digs with his widow.<br> Hammond. It was Eric Hammond,<br> wasn't it?<br> Yeah.<br> I remember the funeral.<br> How'd he get killed?<br> Quite nasty.<br> He worked with a lathe.<br> Very careless.<br> He was using a hand-file.<br> It shot off and stuck through him.<br> We thought he'd done it on purpose.<br> On purpose!<br> Yes.<br> Funny way to commit suicide.<br> She got no compensation.<br> The case went against her.<br> We gave her a bit, not much.<br> End of the street, or front door?<br> End of the street will do.<br> Right.<br> Good night, Frank.<br> Good night, Mr. Weaver.<br> Frank!
