System:<br> Man Speaking Italian]<br> [Man Speaking Italian Continues]<br> Pardon me.<br> Are you Maria Williams?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Oh, I'm Anita Hutchins.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi. Mr. Burgoyne sent me down to meet you.<br> I'm with the agency.<br> Here, let me take your bag.<br> Thank you.<br> We're over here. Come on.<br> - This is your apartment?<br> - You like it?<br> I'm awed!<br> Secretaries live very well in Rome.<br> You'll get spoiled after a while. Frances!<br> Yes? I'm having breakfast<br> on the balcony. Come on out.<br> - Welcome to Rome.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Did you have any trouble finding her?<br> - I picked her out first try.<br> - Have you had any breakfast?<br> - I can't remember.<br> Then have some with us. Anna!<br> Oh, my, oh, my!<br> Oh, what a beautiful way to live.<br> I'm glad you like it. When Anita leaves,<br> I was going to suggest...<br> - [Anita] I've already told her.<br> - Anna. This is Miss Williams.<br> - Buon giorno, signorina. [Italian]<br> - How do you do?<br> [Speaking Italian]<br> What would you like?<br> - Oh, anything, thank you.<br> - [Speaking Italian]<br> [Italian]<br> I don't think I could afford anything<br> as elegant as this, or even half of it.<br> I promise you can.<br> You're paid at the agency in dollars.<br> The rate of exchange<br> is in your favor.<br> - Are you with the agency too?<br> - No, I'm John Frederick Shadwell's secretary.<br> - The man who wrote Winter Harvest?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - No less.<br> - Mmm. He's a great writer, isn't he?<br> He's a great man.<br> I thought he was dead.<br> Most people do, because he hasn't been<br> back to America since his early 20s.<br> Frances has been with him<br> for 15 years.<br> Gosh.<br> Oh, when do I meet my boss?<br> After breakfast.<br> We'll all drive to work together.<br> You'll meet him in plenty of time.<br> There's nothing rushed in Rome.<br> Oh, I'm going to like Rome,<br> at any rate of exchange.<br> - What's that?<br> - That's the Fountain of Trevi.<br> [Anita]<br> Do you want to see it?<br> If you throw a coin into the pool,<br> you're supposed to get your wish.<br> Only the wish must always be the same thing...<br> that you'll return again to Rome.<br> I've tossed a coin into the fountain<br> every April for the last... 15 years.<br> It's my spring ritual.<br> It's time to throw one in again.<br> - Don't you want to wish?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Keep me in Rome at least a year,<br> Mr. Fountain.<br> No! No, no. You have to turn around<br> and throw it over your shoulder.<br> - Oh.<br> - [Splashes]<br> Bring me... another year<br> of contentment...<br> whatever gods are listening.<br> A penny's worth of hope.<br> Aren't you going to wish?<br> No. I don't want to<br> come back to Rome.<br> Anita's going home to be married.<br> Then I don't blame you.<br> Don't tempt fate.<br> - Good morning, Eleanor.<br> - Good morning, Anita.<br> This is my desk. You'll share it<br> with me for the time being.<br> Oh, when do I meet Mr. Burgoyne?<br> - I'll see if he's in.<br> - [On Intercom] Yes?<br> Good morning, Mr. Burgoyne.<br> Miss Williams is here. Shall I bring her in?<br> Not at all. I'll come out.<br> - Boss loves to make a good impression.<br> - Any particular instructions?<br> No. Just be yourself.<br> Well, well, well, Miss Williams.<br> Welcome to U.S.D.A.<br> I abbreviate the name of the agency.<br> It's the age of the alphabet.<br> - Oh, I see. Thank you.<br> - We hope you like Rome and the agency.<br> - Thank you. I'm sure I will.<br> - Good, good, good.<br> I thought I'd spend the morning<br> showing Maria how we operate here.<br> Fine, fine, fine. Oh!<br> Mrs. Burgoyne is giving<br> a cocktail party this afternoon.<br> Anita, if you and Miss Williams<br> are not otherwise occupied...<br> Mrs. Burgoyne would like<br> to meet Miss Williams.<br> - Thank you. I'd love to meet Mrs. Burgoyne.<br> - We'll expect you, then.<br> - Buon giorno.<br> - [Man] Buon giorno, signorina.<br> Oh. Good morning.<br> I didn't think you'd be up.<br> - I've been up all night.<br> - I must say, you look it.<br> You might show a little consideration for<br> a man who's just written 20,000 words.<br> You've started it.<br> I got home at midnight<br> intoxicated with an idea.<br> I worked myself<br> into a creative hangover.<br> - Let me fix you some coffee.<br> - No. No, thanks.<br> While you type these up,<br> I'm going to fall into bed.<br> I'm glad you've given up<br> writing articles...<br> and started back to work<br> on a novel again.<br> - I was afraid you were afraid.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> Nothing. I was worried for fear the critics<br> had intimidated you after that last one.<br> - I should have known better.<br> - Of course you should have.<br> I write for myself, not the critics.<br> You'll be pleased to know<br> the old master is back in stride again.<br> I'm rather anxious to hear<br> what you think about the start.<br> Not only do I consider it magnificent...<br> but I have a sneaking suspicion<br> it's pretty good.<br> Get some sleep.<br> I'll knock on your door in time for you<br> to make it to the Burgoyne cocktail party.<br> Not I.<br> I have no intention of exposing myself<br> to that dreary assemblage.<br> When I get up, I'm gonna stroll<br> through the gardens of the villa...<br> in solitary contentment.<br> But I've already accepted<br> the invitation in your name.<br> Then jolly well<br> make an excuse in my name.<br> Do you know what people say<br> when I mention I work for you?<br> [Chuckling]<br> Something envious, I presume.<br> - They say, "Oh, I thought he was dead."<br> - Do they, indeed?<br> You can't be as antisocial as you are<br> and still expect people to know you're alive.<br> - So they think that I'm dead, do they?<br> - Hmm.<br> Well, well.<br> [Chuckles]<br> Wake me at 4:00.<br> I'll make an appearance<br> to prove my public only half right.<br> When these come in from Washington,<br> they have to be translated into Italian.<br> - By me?<br> - Oh, no. We have interpreters here.<br> Georgio, would you come in<br> for a minute, please?<br> Georgio handles<br> our translations for us.<br> Then they're given to Mr. Burgoyne<br> for clearance with the Italian bureau.<br> - Good morning, Miss Anita.<br> - Oh. Good morning.<br> Maria, this is Georgio Bianchi.<br> Georgio, this is Maria Williams.<br> She'll be taking my place<br> when I leave.<br> If I can be of any help,<br> please call me.<br> I heard you were returning<br> to America, Miss Anita.<br> I shall... We shall miss you.<br> Oh. Thank you.<br> Here, would you make a translation<br> of these for Mr. Burgoyne, please?<br> Yes, Miss Anita.<br> Well!<br> I forgot to tell you.<br> There's a policy here.<br> Secretaries are not allowed<br> to go out with local employees.<br> - Mr. Burgoyne's policy, if you please.<br> - How do you manage it, then?<br> Georgio? [Scoffs] We've never<br> exchanged more than two words.<br> - He's just part of the office.<br> - Oh.<br> Does his hand always shake<br> when he gets near to you?<br> You're imagining things.<br> He doesn't even know I exist.<br> Oh! He doesn't know<br> anyone else exists.<br> He didn't even notice whether<br> I was a blonde or a brunette.<br> Well, you're wrong.<br> - Call him in.<br> - [Gasps]<br> Well, I just want to look at<br> those beautiful brown eyes again.<br> - They're not brown, they're blue.<br> - Oh.<br> I mean...<br> It's a good thing I'm going home.<br> With you around here,<br> I'd be in a puddle of trouble in no time.<br> Here, sit down and open those for me.<br> % % [Orchestra]<br> Mr. Shadwell,<br> I don't care what the critics said.<br> I want you to know<br> I just adored your last novel.<br> Unfortunately,<br> there were not enough of you.<br> Tell me... do you get your<br> best ideas at night? I always do.<br> Invariably, but hardly material<br> to write about.<br> My husband declares that I<br> was simply born to be a writer.<br> He says if anyone just took a pencil<br> and followed me around, they'd have a novel.<br> My dear lady, I should be delighted<br> to get behind you with a pencil.<br> Excuse me.<br> [Anita] We've learned from long experience<br> this is the best way to pass the time.<br> So this is Rome,<br> where the pigeons eat caviar.<br> And the secretaries eat alone.<br> Look, did you ever see<br> such a handsome car?<br> - You ever see such a handsome man?<br> - It's Prince Dessi.<br> A prince? Do you know him?<br> - He's a friend of Mr. Shadwell's.<br> - Part of the Roman scene.<br> Um, eligible?<br> Dino is handsome, wealthy, and has<br> one of the oldest titles in Europe.<br> As long as he has the first two,<br> you won't catch him getting married.<br> Oh, what a shame. Oh!<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Oh, I knocked my purse off the railing.<br> - I'll ask Dino to get it for you.<br> - Oh, no. Please don't.<br> - He'll think I did it on purpose.<br> - He won't mind. Dino!<br> - Yes?<br> - We dropped a purse from the balcony.<br> - Would you mind bringing it up?<br> - With the greatest of pleasure.<br> You sure you didn't<br> knock it off on purpose?<br> Oh, no, believe me, I didn't.<br> I'm not that quick-witted.<br> Well, just in case it was instinct...<br> perhaps we'd better warn our friend<br> about Dino before she meets him.<br> He's known as<br> "the predatory prince."<br> And girls who are seen in his company<br> more than once are known as Venice Girls.<br> Why?<br> The time comes when he asks you<br> to fly to Venice with him.<br> Once you're known as a Venice Girl,<br> you might as well go home.<br> - I hope nothing was broken.<br> - Thank you. It belongs to my friend.<br> Maria, this is Prince Dessi.<br> This is Miss Williams.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Fresh from the States.<br> Of course, you know Anita.<br> - Oh, yes. We met when I first came to Rome.<br> - I remember it with sadness.<br> People said bad things about me, and you<br> would not permit me to show you Rome.<br> Have they been telling you<br> disgraceful things about me too?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - That's too bad.<br> If only half the things said about me<br> were true, I'd be a happy man.<br> - I suspect half of them are.<br> - You see?<br> There is a conspiracy against me in Rome.<br> You must excuse me.<br> I haven't spoken to my host yet.<br> I'll be back.<br> He's nice.<br> Oh, I don't believe<br> he's the wolf you say.<br> - Why, he looks as innocent as a little boy.<br> - Oh, that he does.<br> But don't try taking him<br> on your lap to mother him.<br> You'll find yourself suddenly<br> screaming for the police.<br> Well, so much for your first<br> cocktail party in Rome.<br> - Shall we walk home or ride?<br> - Let's walk.<br> Do you know something strange?<br> Except for that handsome prince...<br> not one attractive man<br> came near us at the party.<br> Well, I guess now is as good<br> a time as any to disillusion you.<br> If you're romantic,<br> Rome is not the city for you.<br> Why not?<br> Well, wealthy Italians don't<br> waste their time on secretaries...<br> and the Italians that work at the agency<br> are too poor.<br> Oh. No wonder you're<br> going home to be married.<br> I'm not even engaged. I gave that<br> as an excuse at the agency for leaving.<br> But at least I'm going back to a country<br> where I hope some nice guy will ask me.<br> That's why I didn't throw a coin<br> in the Fountain of Trevi.<br> Oh, dear. It looks as though<br> I've wasted a perfectly good penny.<br> Well, which way?<br> This way looks sort of interesting.<br> - You want to try it?<br> - It doesn't look very respectable.<br> Good. Let's have a look.<br> - [Whistling]<br> - [Chattering]<br> [Wolf Whistle]<br> - Anita, somebody pinched me.<br> - Don't look back.<br> It's considered an encouragement.<br> Pretend you didn't notice.<br> Are you kidding?<br> I'll kick him in his antipasto.<br> - Oh, let's go.<br> - [Speaking Italian]<br> [Bell Dinging]<br> - Georgio!<br> - Oh. Miss Anita.<br> We've been waiting for you. I thought<br> you said 7:00. What detained you?<br> [Speaks Italian]<br> I've been showing Maria the city,<br> and he followed us.<br> You shouldn't be in this section<br> unescorted, Miss Anita.<br> Things can happen<br> that American girls don't understand.<br> We understand, all right.<br> A pinch is a pinch in any man's language.<br> As long as you are here<br> and I am here, Miss Anita...<br> would you allow me<br> to show you my Rome?<br> - We'd love to.<br> - Well, sure.<br> Bene.<br> [Speaking Italian]<br> It's strange.<br> We have seen each other<br> every day for two years...<br> and yet this is the first time<br> I have ever really talked to you.<br> I always thought<br> you didn't like Americans.<br> - Oh, no. I thought you didn't like Italians.<br> - Isn't that silly?<br> What's that monastery?<br> [Georgio] Oh, no, it's not a monastery.<br> It's a palazzo.<br> - Apalazzo? That's a palace, isn't it?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Who owns it?<br> - It's the home of the prince, Dino Dessi.<br> Oh. Well, you two<br> just drink your wine.<br> I'm gonna sit here<br> and look at the palazzo.<br> - Does he live there all alone?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Oh.<br> - He lives with his mother, the principessa.<br> Oh, how sweet.<br> But he must get lonely.<br> What does he do for amusement?<br> Oh, he has diversions.<br> He plays the piccolo.<br> - He plays what?<br> - The piccolo.<br> He's an excellent piccolo player.<br> - My cousin is his teacher.<br> - [Laughs]<br> That does it. I think I'll have<br> some wine with you after all.<br> Good! This is the wine<br> that we drink on our festa.<br> Have you ever been to<br> an Italian festa, Miss Anita?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> We are having one<br> at our farm tomorrow...<br> to celebrate my sister's engagement.<br> You shouldn't go back to America<br> without seeing an Italian festa.<br> Uh, if you would like<br> to come too, Miss Williams...<br> No, thank you. I have to stay<br> and write some letters.<br> My family expect a report from me,<br> and I can't disappoint them.<br> - Why don't you go, Anita?<br> - I'd love to, but I don't think I could.<br> I know. It's against the agency rules.<br> Oh, but it's only this once.<br> You're not gonna let<br> some silly old rule stand in your way.<br> Well, it isn't that.<br> I have packing to do.<br> My cousin has a truck. He is driving in<br> to pick up our relatives in Rome.<br> We could ride in the truck,<br> if you didn't mind.<br> Oh, all right, Georgio. I'll be darned if<br> I'll spend my last weekend in Rome alone.<br> [Chuckling]<br> [Shouting In Italian]<br> [Shouting Continues, Laughing]<br> Georgio, you're not giving it wine?<br> Oh, no, no, Miss Anita. Water.<br> I am sorry to be late,<br> but unfortunately, a wheel came off.<br> Andiamo.<br> [Chuckling]<br> - This is my cousin, Enrico.<br> - How do you do?<br> [Speaking Italian]<br> - [All Laughing]<br> - What?<br> - These are all your cousins?<br> - Oh, yeah.

You mean that the situation<br> is such that it became necessary...<br> for her to create this deception?<br> You don't have to answer that,<br> if you prefer not to.<br> I'd gladly answer it, Mr. Burgoyne.<br> Anita has done nothing wrong,<br> I promise you.<br> Why don't you ask her yourself?<br> I will. Thank you<br> for your reassurance, Miss Williams.<br> It's only that my interest in my girls<br> here transcends official obligation.<br> - Is that all, sir?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> [Anita]<br> Yes.<br> Yes, but you see, we haven't had<br> any official notification of it yet.<br> Yes, sir. Yes. All right.<br> Via Condore.<br> Fifty-one, yes.<br> I can't understand why she said<br> she was going home to get married.<br> Do you know if she's seen a doctor?<br> Such a thing would never occur to me.<br> She seems like such a nice girl.<br> Nice girls are human, my dear.<br> Hi.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm moving.<br> - Anita, what's happened?<br> - How could you have done this to me?<br> - How could you?<br> - Do what?<br> I don't know<br> what you're talking about.<br> What business was it of yours<br> if I went to the country with Georgio?<br> What right had you to tell Burgoyne<br> I'm not going home to get married?<br> Well, he asked me why...<br> I only thought I was helping you.<br> Did you think you were helping by<br> telling him I spent the weekend with Georgio?<br> I didn't say it that way.<br> Well, he asked me<br> if I wanted to consult his doctor.<br> He said the office would be<br> very happy to pay for it.<br> He wanted to know how long<br> this had been going on.<br> Anita, l...<br> I'm sorry.<br> Well, I'm going home<br> in a few days anyway...<br> so in the meantime,<br> you stay here in the apartment.<br> I'm going to stay someplace<br> by myself.<br> Will you please listen to me?<br> I can't remember what I said to Mr. Burgoyne,<br> but believe me, it's been distorted.<br> Well, he fired Georgio!<br> Oh, no.<br> He fired him<br> without a recommendation.<br> Jobs are hard to get<br> without a recommendation.<br> He wanted to be a lawyer.<br> Now he can't.<br> We certainly left him<br> with something to remember us by.<br> - Anita!<br> - [Door Opens, Closes]<br> - Hello, Georgio.<br> - Anita.<br> You should not have come here.<br> How did you find this place?<br> I looked your address up<br> in the office files.<br> - I cannot ask you in.<br> - Please.<br> It's not a good place.<br> Burgoyne told me why he fired you.<br> I knew the rules. I broke them.<br> I cannot honestly say I regret it.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - I shall try for another position.<br> Failing that,<br> I can always return to my family.<br> It's not hopeless.<br> If you'll have to go home, you won't<br> be able to continue your studies.<br> Perhaps I shouldn't be a lawyer<br> if I cannot honor simple office rules.<br> Look, don't justify Burgoyne!<br> This could cost you your career.<br> - I'm not gonna let him do it to you.<br> - Anita.<br> You must not be angry.<br> I knew what I was doing.<br> This happened.<br> I will accept the consequences.<br> I'm gonna go back to him<br> and make him take you back.<br> You will only convince him<br> he acted wisely in the first place.<br> But... I can't just go away...<br> leaving you here to face<br> a problem I created for you.<br> You will go back to America,<br> as you have to...<br> and I will return to our farm,<br> if I must.<br> Georgio, I have a day or two left<br> before I have to go back.<br> Would it help you at all<br> if we spent them together?<br> Anita.<br> Oh, cara.<br> No. What could I offer you?<br> I have no job. In the end,<br> you have to leave anyhow.<br> - You are not free.<br> - I'm free to do anything I please!<br> - You are going home to be married.<br> - I'm not going to be married.<br> I'm not even engaged.<br> I only told Burgoyne that as a excuse<br> for leaving the agency.<br> There is no one?<br> [Sighs]<br> There's no one.<br> - Come in, signorina.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Frances!<br> - Yes?<br> - Hello, Maria.<br> - Hello.<br> - Should I have phoned?<br> - No, of course not. Thank you, Louisa.<br> - What is it?<br> - I can't find Anita.<br> I've checked the hotels. She hasn't<br> been back, hasn't been to the office.<br> - I'm just worried sick.<br> - Well, I don't think we need worry about it.<br> Anita's hurt and unhappy, and she probably<br> wants to be alone for a few days.<br> She'll show up.<br> Did you talk to Burgoyne?<br> He won't take Georgio back.<br> Oh! He's a fool.<br> - What can we do?<br> - Nothing at the moment.<br> Now, stop worrying about it.<br> It wasn't your fault.<br> Look, do you think Mr. Shadwell<br> could get Georgio's job back for him?<br> - That would help.<br> - Well, we'll see.<br> I'm going over to the museum to pick<br> him up now. Why don't you come along.<br> - You haven't been to the museum yet?<br> - No.<br> Museums I can do without.<br> I was born in one.<br> - You were?<br> - Sure.<br> My dad had an Indian museum<br> on the highway next to his gas station.<br> It was free with 10 gallons of gas.<br> This one has a different<br> kind of an attraction.<br> What?<br> Prince Dino is there with Shadwell<br> discussing some paintings he's donating.<br> - Oh.<br> - Wouldn't you like to see him again?<br> - He'd just love to see me.<br> - You could discuss art with him.<br> That would be a change.<br> What does he collect, nudes?<br> No, as a matter of fact,<br> he's mad about modern paintings.<br> Oh, that's a side I'd never suspect.<br> Why don't you show him you have<br> a side he'd never suspect?<br> - Show him you have a mind.<br> - Oh-ho!<br> Oh, I love you,<br> but I couldn't fool a fool.<br> - I don't know anything about art.<br> - Give it a try.<br> You might end up<br> meeting his mother.<br> And why should I want<br> to meet his mother?<br> Meeting Mama in Italy<br> is the first step to the altar.<br> Oh. Well, um,<br> let's discuss art some more.<br> Don't forget... neo-impressionism.<br> Neo-impressionist.<br> Neo-impressionist.<br> Neo-impressionist.<br> Harmony of color... and infinity.<br> You'll do.<br> How can you say it bores you?<br> You, with your heritage.<br> My heritage included a castle<br> with no plumbing...<br> but I happen to prefer<br> running water and modern art.<br> You'll forgive me if I don't take<br> your opinion seriously.<br> I knew you when you were still running<br> around in three-cornered pants.<br> Hello. I'm Maria Williams.<br> We met at the Burgoyne's, Mr. Shadwell,<br> but I'm sure you don't remember me.<br> You're quite wrong.<br> I remember you very well.<br> It's the party I've forgotten.<br> - How do you do, Miss Williams?<br> - Hello.<br> I drove over with Miss Frances. She asked me<br> to tell you she's waiting for you outside.<br> Punctuality is the vice of virtuous<br> women. May I drop you?<br> No, thank you. I have my car.<br> Dino, take the advice<br> of an old friend.<br> Don't treat a work of art<br> as you do an automobile...<br> turning it in for a new model<br> every year.<br> - We can't live in the past forever.<br> - Exactly.<br> Nonsense. We live in the past<br> from the moment we're born.<br> Personally, I think heritage<br> can sometimes shackle art.<br> Not to forget plumbing.<br> - Good day, Miss Williams.<br> - Good day.<br> I shall leave heretics<br> to their heritage.<br> Well, it's very nice to see you again.<br> Oh, I wonder... do you know<br> if the museum has any modern art?<br> Modern? In what sense?<br> Now you really will think<br> I'm a heretic, but...<br> I'm passionately interested<br> in the, uh, neo-impressionists.<br> - You are?<br> - Oh, I thought you'd be outraged.<br> But, yes, I'm mad about them.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I'm a neo-impressionist myself.<br> There's a fine collection here.<br> May I show you the room?<br> - Well...<br> - This way.<br> Unless I miss my guess...<br> sending that girl in to get me<br> was a feminine intrigue of yours.<br> - Am I right?<br> - Whatever makes you think that?<br> Don't be evasive.<br> Dino told me<br> of your interference in Venice.<br> What are you trying to be,<br> Mother Goose?<br> - Maria is a friend of mine.<br> - And Dino is a friend of mine.<br> Let people lead their own lives.<br> They have absolutely nothing<br> in common.<br> You'd be surprised. Dino's fond of art,<br> and Maria was born in a museum.<br> - She was born where?<br> - Ask her yourself.<br> Her father is curator<br> of a museum out west.<br> You're right. I am surprised.<br> - Do you like it?<br> - How can you ask?<br> - Does it speak to you?<br> - Oh, yes, definitely.<br> Well, then, what does it tell you?<br> What does it say?<br> Well, different pictures say<br> different things to different people.<br> Yes, but the right paintings say<br> the right things to the right people.<br> Yes, and you're so right.<br> Well, this...<br> Now, this seems to have a...<br> a feeling of space.<br> Those lines that carry you off<br> into the distance.<br> Oh, infinity is... is so lonely.<br> Yes, it makes me want to cry.<br> You surprise me.<br> I could not have<br> put it better myself.<br> Oh, well,<br> you mustn't let me keep you.<br> I'm just going to sit here a while<br> and absorb it.<br> If I may,<br> I'll sit here and absorb also.<br> - It was such an enjoyable afternoon.<br> - What are you going to do now?<br> Now?<br> Well, I'm going to go inside<br> and sit down and just think quietly...<br> about all those lovely paintings.<br> You must think me silly<br> to feel so deeply about art.<br> Oh, not at all. One seldom meets<br> an American girl...<br> with your sensitivity,<br> your sense of appreciation.<br> It's wonderful.<br> Well, if that is so it's probably<br> because I'm half Italian.<br> - You are half Italian?<br> - Well, actually, three-quarters.<br> But I resemble<br> my Irish grandmother.<br> [Laughing]<br> Now, imagine! Three-quarters.<br> Mmm, well,<br> that's why I took this job in Rome.<br> I wanted to be near my own kind.<br> Well, thank you again<br> for dropping me here. I must hurry in.<br> Now, I shall see you again?<br> I don't know.<br> You see, I'm rather afraid of you.<br> - Afraid? Of me?<br> - Oh, not because of your reputation.<br> But, you see, I've discovered<br> you have an exciting mind.<br> Something that handsome men<br> rarely have.<br> The combination might be too much<br> for someone as responsive as I am.<br> Well, good-bye,<br> and thank you again.<br> [Car Door Closes]<br> [Engine Starts, Car Pulls Away]<br> You sent for me, signorina?<br> Yes. I'm told that the Prince Dino Dessi<br> often dines here.<br> - He is a friend of the signorina's?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> I'm giving a small dinner party for him,<br> and I thought you might be able to tell me...<br> what his favorite dish is.<br> Of course. He is particularly fond<br> of saltimbocca alla Romana.<br> Oh. Just a moment.<br> - Saltimbocca...<br> - Alla Romana.<br> Alla Romana.<br> And his favorite wine?<br> Oh... Oh, yes. Lacrima Christi.<br> Lacrima Christi.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Would the signorina<br> like to order now?<br> Yes. I'll have a cup of coffee,<br> please.<br> A cup of coffee.<br> It is his favorite opera, signorina.<br> This I know.<br> Oh, no. No, I know<br> that he likes, uh, Wagner.<br> Wagner? That is impossible!<br> He likes Italian opera.<br> I heard, myself,<br> him say many times...<br> that German music<br> assails the ear with its fists.<br> Italian caresses with its fingertips.<br> Well, thank you.<br> % % [Orchestra: Classical]<br> % % [Continues]<br> % % [Man Singing In Italian]<br> % % [Continues]<br> Will you excuse me?<br> I'll join you presently.<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - Buona sera, Dino. Come stai?<br> - Ah, my friend. You must sit with us.<br> - I can only stay a moment.<br> I'm with the Burgoynes, and I wouldn't<br> want to inflict them on you.<br> - How do you do, Miss Williams?<br> - How do you do?<br> - I saw you at the opera. Did you enjoy it?<br> - Rossini is one of her favorites.<br> Indeed. I do wish Alvarez<br> were less limited in his tessitura.<br> - Don't you?<br> - Do you?<br> - No. No, not at all.<br> - I don't either.<br> But surely you disagree about<br> the various tempi of the conductor?<br> Why?<br> Now, my friend, we found no fault<br> with this performance.<br> - You cannot spoil it for us.<br> - Oh, I'm sure Mr. Shadwell wouldn't do that.<br> - L-It's just that he's a perfectionist.<br> - Thank you.<br> I know that from your books.<br> - Which one?<br> - All of them.<br> Well, you've certainly covered<br> a lot of territory.<br> Dino, you're in the hands<br> of an expert.<br> Good evening, Miss Williams.<br> Arrivederci, caro.<br> Ciao.<br> He likes you.<br> And I'm glad,<br> because he's my friend.<br> Now, what shall we have?<br> Well, I know this is mad...<br> but I would just love<br> some saltimbocca alla Romana.<br> Excellent! Saltimbocca alla Romana<br> is a favorite of mine.<br> Now, what would you like<br> to drink with it?<br> Do you suppose they'd have<br> some Lacrima Christi?<br> But of course!<br> Maria, it is astounding<br> how much we have in common.<br> [Chuckles]<br> Well, you're very kind.<br> Italians certainly have mastered<br> the art of gallantry.<br> But it's true.<br> It's sweet of you to say so, but you needn't<br> pretend that you like everything I like.<br> It's too tiresome for you.<br> But I swear it's true. I can think of nothing<br> on which we disagree. It's amazing.<br> You really are a nice person.<br> You try so hard to make a girl feel<br> that she's chosen the right thing.<br> Whether it's true or not<br> isn't important.<br> It's the motive that counts.<br> Don't you think so?<br> Of course. Which proves<br> that we agree on everything.<br> [Speaking Italian]<br> - [Responds In Italian]<br> - Grazie.<br> What's the matter?<br> Maria...<br> there is something I want.<br> - Well, what?<br> - I should like to have you meet my mother.<br> Well, if you like.<br> - Sunday.<br> - So soon?<br> I shall call for you.<br> % % [Classical: Piccolo]<br> % % [Continues]<br> [Doorbell Buzzes]<br> [Speaks Italian]<br> % % [Continues]<br> Oh, you're early.<br> You play the piccolo too?<br> No, but I've always<br> wanted to learn.<br> If you're going to study music,<br> Rome is the place to do it.<br> - [Record Player Clicks Off]<br> - But I also play the piccolo!<br> Now, Dino, you must stop saying<br> that you like everything I like.<br> You're going to make me think<br> you're insincere.<br> But I do play the piccolo.<br> - You see?<br> - But you play like an angel.<br> Perhaps someday we can play duets.<br> I should like that.<br> Well, I think that we should not<br> keep my mother waiting.<br> [Speaking Italian]<br> [Responds In Italian]<br> Maria?<br> - Maria, this is my mother.<br> - How do you do?<br> It was good of you<br> to come to see me.<br> Thank you.<br> - Isn't she lovely, Mother?<br> - You failed to do her justice.<br> Dino, bring my blue shawl.<br> It is chilly.<br> Uh, but, Mother,<br> you have your blue shawl.<br> Take it away.

I want to talk<br> to Maria alone for a moment.<br> - Will you have a cigarette?<br> - No, thank you.<br> [Clears Throat]<br> It's a lovely day, isn't it?<br> I want to tell you,<br> I was predisposed to like you.<br> You were? Why?<br> You have made my son happy.<br> For that, I am grateful.<br> Oh, I shall not live forever.<br> It was a matter of concern to me that he<br> should depend on me for understanding.<br> - Well, I really haven't...<br> - My son tells me you are half Italian.<br> Oh, yes, uh, actually three-quarters.<br> Your father?<br> Yes, but, um, l-I really didn't know him.<br> He died when I was a baby.<br> A pity. My son also lost his father<br> when he was a child.<br> You both have an early tragedy<br> in your lives.<br> It is good that two people<br> should start with understanding.<br> Yes, l-I guess so.<br> Dino, you are much too quick.<br> Now, Mother, I shall tell you<br> something that will amaze you.<br> Do you know<br> that she plays the piccolo?<br> I am amazed.<br> Well, I don't, really.<br> I'm just beginning.<br> Oh, you are modest.<br> Dino, bring us some wine.<br> We shall drink a toast.<br> Do you know what wine she likes?<br> Lacrima Christi!<br> - No!<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes?<br> - Yes.<br> - No.<br> - Yes!<br> I'm very glad<br> that you like my mother.<br> How could I help but like her?<br> She's the only woman I've ever trusted<br> completely... until I met you.<br> Oh.<br> - [Emergency Brake Sets]<br> - [Engine Off]<br> There is something I would<br> like to say to you, Maria.<br> Yes?<br> But first I should like<br> to explain to you that...<br> what experiences I have had<br> in my life before...<br> have left me... suspicious.<br> But you're not<br> the least bit suspicious.<br> - That's one of the things I like about you.<br> - I hide it well.<br> But always beneath...<br> there was cynicism.<br> I say "was," because since knowing you<br> it is gone.<br> Oh, Maria,<br> it is good to be free of doubt...<br> to find someone<br> that you can trust completely.<br> - Dino, l-I think...<br> - No, wait.<br> First I want<br> to tell you something.<br> Here, where the heart asks<br> only to be trusted...<br> I must tell you, Maria, that l...<br> Dino, please don't say anything more.<br> Could it be possible that<br> I misunderstood how you feel?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Then why should I not speak?<br> Because there's something<br> I have to tell you first.<br> This may hurt you,<br> but I must say it.<br> Oh, Dino.<br> I've lied to you<br> from the first moment we met.<br> I've done nothing to restore<br> your faith or your trust.<br> I went after you<br> with a well-organized system.<br> - You are making a joke.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> Look. Look, l... l...<br> I made a record...<br> of everything about you...<br> what pleased you<br> or what displeased you.<br> And then I pretended to like<br> everything that you liked...<br> music and food, everything.<br> And you... you were as trusting as a lamb.<br> You didn't have a chance.<br> - I cannot believe this.<br> - Well, it's true.<br> Look, I don't know opera<br> from boogie...<br> or Lacrima Christi<br> from Corpus Christi.<br> And I loathe the piccolo.<br> Dino, if...<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - [Engine Starts]<br> - Anita! When did you get back?<br> - Last night.<br> - Does Maria know?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, I'm glad to see you. We've looked<br> for you in every hotel in Rome.<br> Maria told me. I've been<br> in the country with Georgio's family.<br> We're trying to get Burgoyne<br> to take Georgio back.<br> He'll apologize to you for all those<br> nasty suspicions before you leave.<br> He owes me no apology.<br> Anyway,<br> I'm going home as planned.<br> What about Georgio?<br> What about him?<br> Had you thought of staying<br> and marrying him?<br> He doesn't think we should.<br> But you're obviously<br> in love with him.<br> Well, he's dreadfully poor.<br> Even with his job,<br> he can barely support himself.<br> He'd have to give up his studies<br> or take me to live with his people.<br> He says either way it wouldn't work.<br> - Well, how do you feel about it?<br> - [Sobs]<br> Oh, my darling!<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Is there anything I can do?<br> Just leave me alone, please.<br> - Well, what are you doing?<br> - Packing.<br> I can see that. But why?<br> I'm going home.<br> I'm going back with Anita.<br> He hasn't even tried to see me.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Never knew I could feel this way.<br> It's pretty awful.<br> I know it is.<br> It's awful, for both of you.<br> I hope you won't mind<br> being alone in the apartment...<br> but I couldn't stay on, you know.<br> Of course not.<br> I'm glad I'm not young<br> and vulnerable anymore.<br> - [Knocking]<br> - Yes?<br> I have brought the signorina<br> a present.<br> Why, Louisa, how nice of you.<br> Thank you.<br> - [Kitten Mewls]<br> - Why, Louisa!<br> Whatever made you do this?<br> Oh, he's a dear little thing.<br> We have worried about<br> your being alone, signorina.<br> Is he old enough to be<br> taken away from his mother?<br> Oh, yes.<br> My sister say the age is right.<br> She's... How do you say?<br> Oh. A maiden lady.<br> She has many cats.<br> She would not be without one.<br> She talks to them<br> from morning till night...<br> just as if they were people.<br> Does she, indeed?<br> I will bring you a box<br> to take it home in.<br> Thank you, Louisa.<br> [Kitten Continues Mewling]<br> [Loud Meow]<br> Oh, no, my friend.<br> It hasn't come to that yet.<br> You're dear and small.<br> But I'm not going to turn to you<br> out of loneliness.<br> - Good morning, Miss Frances.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Where did that come from?<br> - Louisa gave it to me.<br> - Why?<br> - Why shouldn't she?<br> All the old maids in Rome have cats.<br> I've seen them in the evening in the courtyard,<br> feeding them leftover spaghetti.<br> That sounds rather waspish.<br> Will you be able to type up<br> last night's pages for me this morning?<br> Yes.<br> - Is anything the matter?<br> - No.<br> You seem a bit curt this morning.<br> I've come to a reluctant decision.<br> - I'll talk to you about it later.<br> - Moral cowardice?<br> Very well.<br> I've decided I want to<br> go back to America.<br> [Chuckling]<br> Why?<br> Well, why shouldn't I?<br> - Have I done anything to offend you?<br> - No.<br> Then you have no possible reason<br> for wanting to go back to America.<br> I've been away for 15 years.<br> I want to go home.<br> - Would you like a holiday?<br> - No.<br> I'd like to finish this work for you.<br> Then I'd like to go<br> have my passport checked.<br> This is nonsense.<br> What would you go back to?<br> You've no relations.<br> You'd live alone in a hotel room,<br> go to concerts on Sunday...<br> and work for some dull-witted<br> business executive.<br> - What is attractive about that prospect?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Nevertheless, I am going home.<br> - Oh.<br> What about me?<br> How am I going to get along without you?<br> I've come to depend upon you.<br> I dislike change.<br> I dislike new faces.<br> Friends of mine are going back,<br> and I want to go with them.<br> Maybe a hotel room alone in New York<br> will be hard to take.<br> But the prospect of becoming<br> a lonely old maid...<br> with a life behind her,<br> a stranger in a foreign country...<br> isn't much to look forward to either.<br> And who knows?<br> Perhaps some nice old man<br> will want to marry me after all.<br> Have you ever considered<br> the possibility of marrying me?<br> Every woman considers that prospect<br> with every man she meets.<br> I'm quite serious.<br> I would guarantee you<br> the companionship you want.<br> You've certainly had time to get used to me.<br> There would be no surprises.<br> You know me too well.<br> I have enormous respect for you.<br> You add greatly to my comfort.<br> In fact, you're about the only woman I know<br> to whom I would make such a rash offer.<br> A marriage... based on friendship?<br> The Chinese marry as total strangers.<br> At least we met.<br> [Chuckles] And suppose you should<br> wake up one bright morning and discover...<br> that I was desperately<br> in love with you.<br> Wouldn't you find that<br> rather disturbing?<br> The possibility of arousing unsuspected passion<br> at my age would be not only disturbing...<br> but rather miraculous.<br> Would you care to think this over<br> for a day or two?<br> Are you sure you wouldn't?<br> The offer is quite genuine...<br> if a bit casual.<br> Then my acceptance<br> is quite casual...<br> but a bit genuine.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm sure we'll be quite compatible.<br> - Grazie, Anna.<br> - Prego, signorina.<br> - Hi!<br> - Hi.<br> I'm just writing my folks that I'm<br> bringing you home to stay a while with us.<br> But I'm not going home after all.<br> - But you said this morning...<br> - That was a hundred years ago.<br> I've decided to stay and get married.<br> - No!<br> - Isn't it ironic?<br> You're both so young<br> and so lovely...<br> but of the three of us<br> I'm to be the bride.<br> - Shadwell?<br> - Who else?<br> No!<br> [Laughing]<br> - Oh, that's wonderful. How did it happen?<br> - I don't know.<br> I really don't know.<br> After being in love with him for 15 years,<br> this silly man has asked me to marry him.<br> Have you ever heard<br> of anything so absurd?<br> [Intercom Buzzes]<br> - Good morning!<br> - Good morning, Louisa.<br> I brought these flowers.<br> Will you put them in a vase, please?<br> - Is Mr. Shadwell up yet?<br> - He's up and gone out. His door was open.<br> Have breakfast ready for him.<br> He's probably just gone for a walk.<br> Yes, signorina...<br> Oh, the signorina has a new dress!<br> It is very pretty.<br> Maybe a... a little too young.<br> Oh, it is spring, signorina!<br> [Laughing]<br> You should have come to me<br> the first time this happened, my friend.<br> That would hardly<br> have been possible.<br> I've had headaches all my life.<br> What do I do now?<br> I would advise you to go to America.<br> Dr. Weisner is there now.<br> - He has managed, in these cases, to delay...<br> - No, thank you.<br> - I have no desire to prolong uncertainty.<br> - Think about it a while.<br> I prefer to think how best<br> to spend this year allotted me.<br> One is not infallible<br> in matters of time.<br> I don't think I shall work today,<br> Dr. Martinelli.<br> There's never any preparation<br> for a death sentence, is there?<br> There is a lifetime.<br> That sounds like something<br> I might have written.<br> - Good-bye, Doctor. Thank you.<br> - Good-bye.<br> Come.<br> Mr. Hoyt, there's a gentleman here<br> to see you about something.<br> Come in, sir.<br> - Thank you. Mr. Hoyt?<br> - That's me, sir.<br> - I'm John Frederick Shadwell.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> That's interesting.<br> Same name as the writer.<br> - I am the writer.<br> - You are?<br> Well, I'm one of your fans.<br> - That's good to hear.<br> - Looking for material for a new novel?<br> Just information. I want to know what<br> must be done to ship a body to America.<br> Well, you've come to the right man.<br> That's my specialty.<br> I handle former citizens.<br> [Laughing]<br> - You seem to enjoy your work.<br> - Oh, I don't mind it.<br> Other vice-consuls have clients<br> who talk back. Mine don't.<br> An obvious advantage.<br> Now then, I should like to know the exact<br> procedure in having a body shipped home.<br> Well, first I must have a letter<br> making the request.<br> - Who writes the letter?<br> - That's a good question.<br> The regulations say a close relative.<br> Then I must have a certificate<br> from the doctor...<br> a notarized report<br> for the American port of entry...<br> then permission from the city of Rome<br> and an export license.<br> Sounds quite complicated.<br> Dead or alive,<br> there's still a lot of red tape to it.<br> Thank you, Mr. Hoyt.<br> I shan't detain you any longer.<br> I assume this is all<br> for a new story of yours.<br> - There actually is no body.<br> - Oh, there's a body, all right.<br> - Is there? Whose?<br> - Mine.<br> Good day, sir.<br> [Door Opens, Closes]<br> You were up early this morning.<br> - You want your breakfast?<br> - Not at the moment.<br> - I finished these pages.<br> - Thank you.<br> Is anything the matter?<br> - I've had a very bad night.<br> - Let me get you some coffee.<br> I was quite concerned over this impulsive<br> discussion we had about marriage yesterday.<br> This morning I realized you could not<br> possibly have taken me seriously.<br> Why not?<br> Because you have too much self-respect<br> to consider seriously...<br> the offer of a man who is interested<br> only in keeping his secretary.<br> You handled it extremely well,<br> and my admiration for your tact is boundless.<br> - Should I have reacted otherwise?<br> - No.<br> Of course you should go home,<br> since it is so important to you.<br> In fact, the sooner you can make arrangements,<br> the more convenient it'll be for me.<br> I want to go to Capri for the summer,<br> and I'd like to get away as soon as possible.<br> Aren't you going<br> to finish the novel?<br> No, I seem to have lost interest<br> in it at the moment.<br> So, if you can book passage...<br> I promise not to place any more<br> embarrassing obstacles in your path.<br> And you do forgive me<br> for my selfish panic?<br> Of course.<br> [Door Closes]<br> [Speaking Italian]<br> Yes, signore?<br> I should like a bottle of scotch,<br> some ice and a siphon of soda.<br> Sorry, sir. No bottles.<br> Why not?<br> Drinks, yes, but no bottles.<br> Very well, my friend.<br> Bring me six double scotches,<br> and line them up before me.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Are you, by any chance,<br> following me, Miss Frances?<br> - Yes.<br> - May I ask why?<br> Dr. Martinelli called after you left.<br> I see.<br> Is what you learned from him the reason<br> you changed your mind about us?<br> I suppose it's quite natural<br> for you to assume that.<br> But the truth is,<br> it had nothing to do with it.<br> It was one of those<br> unfortunate coincidences.<br> Oh.<br> He told me he suggested you return<br> to America. You will go.<br> My dear Miss Frances,<br> my life, my career...<br> has been founded on facing facts<br> as I discover them...<br> never by wishful thinking.<br> I've no intention of seeking<br> a dubious year of grace.<br> But in an extra year's time perhaps the<br> doctors will have discovered an answer.<br> Cures must be discovered sometime.<br> I shall accept my fate with as much<br> good grace as I can muster.<br> - What do you intend to do with those?<br> - I intend to get drunk.<br> - Why?<br> - I've been cautious too long.<br> I'm sorry that you've<br> learned about this.<br> But since you have,<br> you can be of great service to me.<br> I intend to spend the time I have left here<br> in Rome, where I've lived most of my life.<br> But, oddly enough,<br> I want to be buried in America.<br> There are numerous details involved that I<br> should like to leave in your capable hands.<br> Please don't.<br> I can't listen<br> when you talk like this.<br> Then I shall turn the matter<br> over to someone less emotional.<br> [Sobbing]<br> Your greatest asset has always<br> been your detachment...<br> your freedom<br> from sentimentality.<br> It'd be a pity if you shattered<br> that record at the end.<br> And now,<br> if... if you don't mind, l...<br> I'd like to be left alone.<br> Does the signora care to order?<br> Yes. Bring me six<br> double scotches, please.<br> - Six?<br> - Six.<br> Very good, signora.<br> May I ask what you intend to do<br> with six double scotches?<br> [Sniffles]<br> I intend to drink them.<br> May I suggest that you'll<br> live to regret it?<br> You may.<br> - But why six?<br> - I suspect a trick.<br> The Americans have thought<br> of a scheme to outwit us of our tips.<br> I must figure this out.<br> - How can one save on six drinks?<br> - Well...<br> That'll be all.<br> [Coughing]<br> Shall I slap you on the back,<br> or shall I call the waiter to do it?<br> Neither.<br> Shouldn't you be at your desk<br> attending to my work?<br> You've given up.<br> Why shouldn't I?<br> I had no idea you went in<br> for this sort of thing.<br> I don't, as a rule.<br> To the Fountain of Trevi.<br> To the lovely, romantic Fountain of Trevi,<br> where hope can be had for a penny.<br> - People are looking at you.<br> - Well, high time.<br> - Do you really think you should?<br> - I really think I should.<br> - Why?<br> - Because...<br> my life is ending.<br> Bambino.<br> Don't hug the shore with it.<br> Be... Be reckless.<br> You've got your whole life<br> ahead of you.<br> See what the world is like.<br> [Speaking Italian]<br> Oh! All right.<br> All right, all right.<br> Here, take it.<br> Take it home and play with it in<br> the bathtub, my brave little adventurer.<br> - What do you want?<br> - Really, Miss Frances.<br> Don't you think you're a bit<br> too old to go wading in public?<br> I'm not too old. I'm not too old<br> to do anything I want to do.<br> Allow me to assist you<br> from that ludicrous and liquid posture.<br> Go away. Go away, please.<br> Give me your hand, then.<br> [Sighs]<br> This'll make you feel much better.<br> I want my mother.<br> You haven't got a mother.<br> I haven't got anybody.<br> Nobody cares what happens to me.<br> [Sobbing]<br> Why didn't you let me drown?<br> A pity you didn't reveal<br> your capacity for vice earlier.<br> The years would've seemed<br> much shorter, and well-spent.<br> You needn't flatter me.<br> Miss Frances, please lie back.<br> You're going to feel dreadful later on.<br> I feel dreadful now.<br> - I've gotta get up.<br> - Why?<br> I've gotta help my friends.<br> They love me very much.<br> - I know.<br> - Oh, poor Georgio.<br> - Poor who?<br> - Oh, don't pretend you don't know.<br> I've got to get to Mr. Burgoyne<br> and make him give Georgio his job back.<br> Anita loves Georgio,<br> and Georgio loves Anita.<br> - Yes.<br> - But you wouldn't understand.<br> You hate everybody!<br> Well, I should certainly hate to see you<br> make a daily habit of this.<br> And I've got to talk to Dino.<br> I want Maria to have her prince.<br> Every girl should have her prince.<br> At least one.<br> My dear Miss Frances,<br> please try and get a little rest.<br> I'll do what I can later, but in the meantime<br> it's important for you to sleep.<br> Sing to me.<br> The only song I know would hardly be<br> appropriate..."The Star-Spangled Banner."<br> You'd have to stand up, and...<br> Do you think<br> you're going to be all right?<br> Miss Frances?<br> Sleep.<br> [Speaking Italian]<br> Signor Shadwell.<br> Show him in.<br> [Speaks Italian]<br> - Well, John!<br> - Hello, Dino.<br> I come bearing presents. You've always<br> wanted these first editions of mine.<br> - I've decided to give them to you.<br> - But I cannot accept.<br> - But you will.<br> - [Chuckling] Well, I'm overwhelmed, John.<br> - Why are you doing this?<br> - Saves my packing them.<br> - I'm going away tomorrow.<br> - Oh. Off to Capri again, huh?<br> America. I'm going home<br> after 15 years... to be married.<br> Miss Frances?<br> How did you know?<br> For years all of Rome has known how<br> Miss Frances felt. Should I be surprised?<br> You should be ashamed.<br> You might have told me.<br> It is much better<br> that you waited, my friend.<br> No man should marry<br> until he is at least your age.<br> I shall accept that<br> as a compliment.<br> - To your happiness.<br> - Thank you.<br> Now, at my age, you see,<br> we have no judgment.<br> - We feel too deeply.<br> - I can understand how you feel.<br> After all, you've just had a narrow escape<br> with that girl at the agency, haven't you?<br> - You know about this?<br> - Oh, all of Rome has known.<br> She almost tricked you<br> into marrying her, I understand.<br> Do you know what that girl did?<br> Kept a little black book on you, I believe.<br> Listed all your likes and dislikes.<br> - Even to the piccolo!<br> - Only a woman could sink that low.<br> [Scoffs]<br> The duplicity of this grasping girl!<br> Of course, we all grasp at happiness,<br> but there are such things as rules.<br> Exactly!<br> I knew you would understand.<br> And you're quite right in letting her<br> go back to America without a word.<br> She deserves to be unhappy.<br> She's going back to America?<br> Oh, she knows she did wrong,<br> so let her suffer for it.<br> You're well out of it, my boy.<br> You've acted like a man.<br> She deceived me.<br> She... She lied to me.<br> Why can't women<br> play the game properly?<br> Everyone knows that in love affairs<br> only the man has the right to lie.<br> - Naturally.<br> - She was very stupid to confess she lied.<br> She didn't have to. Very stupid.<br> See, to... to disillusion me so...<br> These girls in love never realize<br> they should be honestly dishonest...<br> instead of being dishonestly honest.<br> - Do you know what I mean?<br> - Hmm? Oh, certainly.<br> So don't let anyone convince you...<br> that you should be flattered she went<br> to such lengths to capture your interest.<br> Don't worry. I won't.<br> Of course,<br> I would be highly flattered.<br> But then, I'm an older man.<br> - Not much.<br> - Thank you.<br> Well, I'm glad that I leave you<br> in this happy frame of mind.<br> You know what you want, Dino.<br> Take care of yourself.<br> She'll be out of your life tomorrow,<br> and you'll never be bothered by her again.<br> - Home, Signor Shadwell?<br> - Not yet.<br> - To the Burgoyne villa, and hurry.<br> - Si, signor.<br> - I guess that's everything.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Well, good-bye, beautiful apartment.<br> Good-bye, romantic Rome.<br> Good-bye.<br> [Phone Ringing]<br> Hello?<br> Oh, hello.<br> Where?<br> Oh, all right, dear.<br> Uh-huh. We were just leaving.<br> Bye.<br> That was Frances. She wants us<br> to meet her at the Fountain of Trevi.<br> - [Speaks Italian]<br> - [Responds in Italian]<br> Why do you suppose Frances<br> wanted to meet us here?<br> Maybe she decided<br> to go back with us after all.<br> Well, she'd better hurry up.<br> Our train leaves in half an hour.<br> Why, it's empty.<br> [Workman Speaking Italian]<br> Signor, per che niente acqua?<br> - [Workman] Lo puliscano.<br> - Oh.<br> - Why isn't there any water?<br> - He says they're cleaning the pool.<br> Clean out the old dreams.<br> Make way for the new ones.<br> That fountain is a fraud.<br> When I tossed my coin in, I wished<br> I could stay for a year in Rome.<br> And here I am,<br> leaving after a month.<br> Well, I'm afraid there's no refund.<br> We can't wait around here much longer.<br> We're going to miss our train.<br> Oh, here she is. Well, what happened<br> to you? We've been waiting hours.<br> I only phoned an hour ago.<br> You're mighty mysterious.<br> What's this all about?<br> It's a surprise.<br> Look! The fountain's<br> coming to life again.<br> % % [Chorus: Ballad]<br> Maria.<br> Georgio!<br> % %<br>
