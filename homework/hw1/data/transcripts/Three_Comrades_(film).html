Remember the repair shop!<br> Keep whistling.<br> What are the new heroes of<br> the Fatherland doing tonight?<br> Posioning the drinking water?<br> It's none of your business,<br> we're running a garage<br> we're going to be very rich<br> Germany will need mechanics<br> in the years to come<br> There'll be all sorts of things to repair<br> Souls, consciences, broken hearts and...<br> - Shut up and come inside!<br> Happy birthday! From Gottfried and me.<br> Six, I mean four bottles of Cuban rum<br> and the two missing went for riot attacks!<br> What are we waiting for?<br> There won't be any customers<br> at night. Let's celebrate!<br> Celebrate, that's the thing.<br> Let's get out of this crazy town!<br> Where to? -Anywhere. South<br> America, San Francisco, Mars,<br> I'll settle for a ride in the country.<br> We'll take Baby-the terror of the roads.<br> And the rum. Don't forget the rum!<br> I think he wants to 'play' Otto!<br> Am I mistaken gentlemen? or did<br> we pass somebody on the road?<br> Well I heard a noise<br> Don't forget the rum.<br> What kind of junk is this?<br> You say something?<br> I asked what make your car is<br> Why, it's a Mutt.<br> Grandfather was an airplane<br> and Grandma was an old radio<br> and it's Papa was an alarm clock!<br> Well my name is Breuer.<br> I'm Lenz.<br> This is Koster and Lohkamp.<br> Otto, why don't you show Mr.Breuer the car?<br> It'll be a pleasure.<br> You know<br> you wiped me off the map!<br> Beautiful evening, isn't it?<br> Very.<br> Unusually mild form March.<br> Yes.<br> Terribly mild.<br> We didn't know there was anyone so, er...<br> in the car. We'd have let you win!<br> Why should you?<br> It wouldn't have been fair.<br> We can do 95!<br> You didn't know that naturally.<br> I'm afraid your husband felt insulted.<br> One ought to be able to lose sometimes.<br> And Herr. Breuer isn't my<br> husband, he's just a friend<br> Are you three brothers?<br> No. Do we look alike?<br> Not exactly.<br> But yet you have the same look.<br> Hungry<br> No. Proud!<br> I suppose you wouldn't<br> consider selling the car?<br> I'd sooner consider selling my right arm!<br> Koster!<br> When you take a curve at high<br> speed, do you use the break?<br> I just turn the wheel<br> and hope<br> You know, I drove a car in the war.<br> A squad car in Berlin.<br> Better than the front!<br> Oh much better. And safer.<br> Unlucky for the country.<br> Somebody had to live to run<br> Germany with most of the men dead.<br> What's that?<br> Nothing, nothing.<br> Just turn the wheel and hope!<br> Patricia-that's an English name isn't it?<br> It was my mother's name, she<br> was English. -And your father?<br> German.<br> He was killed fighting the English.<br> My mother died soon after.<br> Were you in the war? -Only a year.<br> He wasn't boiled very<br> hard. Just sort of dipped.<br> We were babies then. -I like that.<br> Gives us something in common.<br> We're neither dead nor alive.<br> Don't say that. -No?<br> No!<br> You and Erich, you're both alive.<br> Remember that.<br> Alright. We'll drink to it.<br> You ought to join our<br> organisation. Make men out of you.<br> Marching men together.<br> -Marching what together?<br> You know too many people think they<br> have the right to opinion nowadays.<br> What Germany needs is order! Discipline!<br> Stop that!<br> Oh, sit down, sit down!<br> You shell shocked fellows give<br> me a pinge with your hysterics!<br> Easy Gottfried!<br> From now on, we'll drink<br> milk on Erich's birthday.<br> So its your birthday? How old are you?<br> Old enough.<br> One of the nicer ages?<br> Which is the nicest?<br> Well...<br> your age I think<br> Yes, just about your age.<br> Think Herr.Breuer can drive<br> alright? -Oh, I think so.<br> If you're not quite sure, one<br> of us could go with you, gladly.<br> No it's alright. He drives<br> the same, drunk or sober!<br> May I call in the morning<br> to see you got home alright?<br> If you like.<br> It's really our fault, you<br> know with all my birthday rum!<br> I wonder what she sees in that swine!<br> Wonderful girl huh?<br> Yeah, she's alright.<br> Alright?<br> You know Erich, I think you must<br> have recieved a serious head wound<br> that you never reported!<br> She's such a tiny thing though.<br> Looks like she could be blown away!<br> Must be nice to remember your birthday.<br> When was yours Gottfried?<br> March.<br> Er, no. April, it used to be.<br> You know Erich<br> Something ought to be done about that girl<br> What girl?<br> What girl? The one with<br> Breuer. What's her name?<br> Pat what?<br> Ah well. How should I know?<br> Maybe she's only got one name.<br> Well you wrote down her address<br> on a matchbox. I saw you.<br> So do I. Matches were all used up.<br> You mean, you threw it away? -Yup.<br> Do you realise what you threw away?<br> And after Otto and I sat listening for an<br> hour to that Breuer so that you could move in.<br> Maybe Otto knows it.<br> No he doesn't. I mean er... maybe he does.<br> I should've known you wouldn't<br> have enough brains to appreciate her<br> Did you see those eyes?<br> Of course not.<br> Because you were looking at<br> yourself through a glass of rum!<br> Very high class rum too.<br> And her hands.<br> Long and slender.<br> Like Romain salad.<br> Otto and I appreciate such things.<br> You should travel Erich,<br> you've never been anywhere.<br> Germans don't understand love.<br> I'm really a Latin, that's what Pat's got.<br> The soul of a South American.<br> If you like South America so much,<br> why did you come back after 3 months?<br> Because I've got the soul of a German.<br> Think I'm going to get myself a drink.<br> Hello? -Er..hello, this is that man.<br> What man? -the man you met the other night.<br> I've met lots of men on lots of other nights.<br> -I don't exactly know how to describe myself.<br> I was one of the men that beat you.<br> -Really you must have the wrong woman.<br> In our car I mean. -Oh, of course<br> you were the one who was so upset<br> about the state of the nation.<br> No<br> No? Well, you must be the one<br> who sang with Herr Breuer. -No,<br> Was there another?<br> Of course, I remember you.<br> I was just wondering if you<br> got home alright. Did you?<br> I'm quite sure I did.<br> That's fine.<br> Well, goodbye.<br> Did you call me up just to say that?<br> No,<br> We just weren't very busy.<br> Well, oddly enough, I'll be<br> busy next Tuesday evening.<br> Well that is odd. Well goodbye.<br> Till Tuesday evening<br> then. -Till Tuesday evening<br> Fraulein Hollmann please, she's<br> expecting me. -If you'll come this way.<br> Whom shall I announce?<br> -Lohkamp, Erich Lohkamp.<br> Well, do I have to wait<br> till the piano goes home?<br> Ludwig always brings<br> people through this door.<br> The piano is my problem child<br> Either there is no entrance or no piano.<br> You'll have to come in through the bedroom.<br> Oh no, I wouldn't think of doing<br> that. Not while, Ludwig's looking.<br> Is there anything more? -No Ludwig, thanks.<br> He loves to think I still own the whole house<br> though I only rent this little bit of it.<br> This was your house? -Hm, long ago.<br> I thought you told me you were poor.<br> Does it look as if I am?<br> Sit down. -Thank you.<br> No easy chair in the shops<br> or the backseat of limousines.<br> Now that's gone.<br> I sold it to Mr.Schultz.<br> We bought a taxi.<br> It's still mild out isn't it?<br> You don't know how to make conversation...<br> I was just thinking something foolish.<br> Thinking how nice it would<br> be to pick a time to be born.<br> I'd pick an age of reaon and quiet.<br> If there ever was one.<br> What would you pick?<br> I don't know...<br> This minute is good enough for me.<br> That's a lovely compliment.<br> Or is it just something<br> you thought of to say?<br> No, what I mean is,<br> How would I know I'd get to<br> meet you in the 'Age of Reason'?<br> Shall we go now?<br> I've to be back here by ten.<br> It's a kind of business<br> affair. I'm trying to get a job.<br> This way, through the bedroom.<br> You can just shut your eyes.<br> Where shall we dine?<br> Well, there's a tea room down the street.<br> Perhaps a big hotel?<br> Nonsense, where would you go?<br> Oh, well that's a terrible<br> place. Alphons' bar.<br> That's absolutely out. -Alphons' bar?<br> It's very rough. No place for a girl like you.<br> -Alphons' bar's exactly the place for a girl like me.<br> This way.<br> It's wonderful, it even smells the way I<br> thought it would. -This is our headquarters.<br> And this is Alphons on his way<br> over. He's crazy about choir singing.<br> Food Erich? -The best you've got!<br> Two dinners!<br> Fraulein Hollmann, this is Alphons.<br> Would you like something<br> special on the phonograph?<br> I would.<br> But I don't know whether you have it.<br> You see I'm crazy about choir singing.<br> Choir singing?<br> Well we have the best! Wait a moment.<br> We're in for it.<br> He's got over 200 records<br> of assorted choir music.<br> Martini and a rum, Alphons.<br> You have the looks of one<br> who enjoys good singing.<br> But only choirs.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Take that away.<br> Sausage is for ordinary people. I have<br> something very special. Bring me some chops.<br> A prized pig. Killed it myself!<br> Thats the only way a man<br> knows what he is getting.<br> I see you understand meat also<br> How about the soldier's hearts?<br> He's madly in love with<br> you. -And I with him.<br> Alphons and I have a lot in common.<br> Meat and music.<br> It's not generally known but<br> I sang in a choir once and<br> have lived like a pig for years.<br> Always smiling.<br> Does that mean you're always happy?<br> Oh yes, I'm a very superficial<br> and frivolous person.<br> You see when I got over...<br> Got over what?<br> What I meant was<br> when I found out I was going completely broke<br> I decided to live as I liked<br> even if, only for a little while.<br> I wanted to be very gay.<br> and I was.<br> Do you think that sounds irresponsible?<br> I think that sounds very brave.<br> I was frightened enough sometimes.<br> As if I'd taken somebody<br> else's seat at the theatre.<br> Now it's all over and<br> I've got to get to work.<br> For Breuer?<br> What made you think of him?<br> Oh, I don't know<br> suddenly felt unhappy.<br> When do you start? -In a week.<br> Then I'd be too tired to<br> go out in the evenings.<br> That doesn't leave us much time.<br> Lost the address huh?<br> The matches were gone so he threw it away!<br> He couldn't even remember her name. Didn't think<br> much of her either the first time he met her.<br> I guess he just didn't have<br> anything better to do tonight.<br> Seems a little embarrassed about something.<br> Pretty clumsy. -I warned<br> you about the riff raff here.<br> Let's keep very quiet<br> and maybe they'll go away.<br> Erich's pretty smart, maybe<br> she's got a lot of money.<br> You know, some men can do that sort of thing.<br> But I couldn't.<br> And they expect us to sit with<br> them as if nothing had happened.<br> My watch says quarter to ten, is that right?<br> There are no clocks in this<br> cafe. Thats why we come here.<br> Koster!<br> Tomorrow's the anniversery<br> of our first attack.<br> Another one from the war. it'll never stop.<br> The dates of battle are our only calendar.<br> Doesn't seem to matter<br> whether you win or not.<br> The war's become a center<br> of everybody's life.<br> A wheel that everything turns on.<br> Sorry, I have to go. -Gottfried.<br> I worry about those two monkeys.<br> You see we've been together so long<br> You're very fond of<br> them. -That's why I worry.<br> Lenz is fighting for a reason in a mad house.<br> Fighting when its so futile to fight.<br> Tormented by his duty to us,<br> to what he calls his conscience.<br> The war did such different things to people.<br> Erich plays well.<br> Sometimes he plays for pocket money.<br> Erich's different from Lenz and me.<br> Erich's still alive. He's<br> got something to live for.<br> What worries me now is that he's drifting.<br> We get along.<br> There are times in life<br> when you want to be alone.<br> I don't want to be alone tonight.<br> Stay with us<br> I mean decisions one has<br> to make when one's alone.<br> There ought to be someone<br> you could ask what to do.<br> Ask us.<br> Its just one of those things<br> that began with the war.<br> There wasn't so much to eat you know.<br> And I grew too fast and ate too little.<br> Well, I...<br> Last year it caught up<br> with me and I took to bed.<br> Were you alone a long while?<br> A year.<br> Then I<br> I've got to go now.<br> I'll take you home.<br> Perhaps I should call a taxi.<br> -Oh no, let's walk, it isn't far.<br> I wouldn't want you to be late<br> for your business appointment.<br> I've heard that its good business<br> to keep business people waiting.<br> What will you do after you take me home?<br> I've got some friends on the other<br> end of town I promised to meet.<br> And have you lots of other<br> friends besides Koster and Lenz?<br> A few. Nice girls too some of them.<br> I'm really sorry about<br> my business appointment.<br> I'd like to see you don't drink<br> any more of those double rums.<br> They never affect me.<br> What I hope is you'll remember<br> it's only a business appointment.<br> What?<br> Why, you baby!<br> Good heavens, what a baby you are!<br> I'm acting like a half-wit.<br> No you're not.<br> That's my ear! -The better to hear me with.<br> Go home Erich and go to bed.<br> Hello! -Hello there.<br> Having your business interview? -Yes.<br> Are you still with your friends<br> on the other end of town?<br> Oh yes, it's quite a crowd.<br> Listen Pat, haven't you had any<br> friends by the name of Erich?<br> Yes.<br> Well then you ought to<br> be able to say my name.<br> Go on, try it. Say 'Erich is a low dog...'<br> Erich is a baby and I like him that way.<br> Only Erich drinks too much.<br> Now I've got to hang up.<br> -Goodnight, sleep well.<br> He has his nerve.<br> He's very young. -Your taste<br> seems to be deteriorating.<br> On the contrary,<br> Let's talk about the phonograph shop.<br> Might be fun if all I had to do<br> was sell records of choirs. -Choirs?<br> What are you talking about?<br> I don't want the job.<br> -Oh Pat, let me help you.<br> Not by giving me a shop with<br> that ridiculous salary. -Why not?<br> Because, I couldn't earn<br> it. Believe me, I couldn't.<br> Well frankly, I didn't think<br> it mattered much to you.<br> You told me once nothing did 'very much.'<br> - Once might be last year or last week,<br> Or even today. But not now.<br> Something to do with those choir records?<br> Maybe. -And that telephone call?<br> Maybe.<br> Pat, I tell you, I don't know<br> what to do with all my money.<br> You'd be safe Pat. Germany's<br> a pretty rough sea right now.<br> And you're drifting.<br> Say that again, about my<br> drifting. -You've got no port.<br> No destination.<br> But I'm not alone anymore!<br> There are so many drifters.<br> And we might all drift together.<br> And someday we might even find pleasant seas!<br> May I drink to that please?<br> To nice weather for drifters!<br> the water pump which died.<br> Lost the license and cap.Drunks tip<br> best, old ladies don't tip at all.<br> There's a moral there somewhere.<br> Whats the matter with you?<br> I'm in a mess.<br> I've completely ruined myself<br> with Pat. Thats what I've done.<br> She's probably used to millionaires<br> and counts and the way they behave.<br> I acted like a drunken sod.<br> Well how do you think millionaires<br> act? Like millionaires?<br> Its too bad though. I should've<br> stayed at Alphons to take care of you.<br> It might've been better for all of us.<br> What do you mean, another riot? -No.<br> But I think a couple of<br> them followed me home.<br> Look, Gottfried. You know all about<br> such things. South America and all that.<br> What does a fellow do? How does he apologise?<br> He doesn't. -I acted like an idiot.<br> Send flowers. They cover everything.<br> Even graves.<br> Now come on. Go to work.<br> Be careful with that radiator.<br> Don't take anybody uphill.<br> I did it, blame me. -What<br> are you talking about?<br> They followed him home last night.<br> This is my contribution to the two of you.<br> We share and share alike. This is<br> what I give you for what you give me.<br> Oh shut up and get to work.<br> I'm sorry, Otto, Erich.<br> -We can't blame you for<br> everything that happens to us.<br> Thats the worst of it. You can.<br> Hello Gottfried. Its nice to see you.<br> We'll be moving again soon.<br> They've found us. Somebody<br> was nearly killed yesterday.<br> Something that you have to tell me?<br> -I..its hard for me to say, Dr.Becker.<br> I can't come here anymore.<br> I can't work with you anymore. -So?<br> I've made up my mind. To withdraw. -Too bad.<br> May I know the reason?<br> Perhaps you no longer believe in what we do.<br> There are things I'm expected to do.<br> And I have no right to<br> do. I have my two comrades.<br> We've lived and fought<br> together so many years.<br> I can never let them down.<br> I have no right to make them fight or pay for<br> something thats important to me.<br> I understand.<br> Its so easy to fight on the<br> wrong side and hurt everyone.<br> But to fight on the right<br> side and hurt the few you love.<br> Get drunk Gottfried. Get very drunk.<br> And love your comrades very much.<br> Goodybe Dr.Becker -Goodbye Gottfried.<br> You see him?<br> Yes and I've just put a<br> knife through my conscience.<br> I promise you Gottfried its better this way.<br> You see? We don't want a dead<br> hero, we want a living man.<br> I wish we were somewhere on<br> earth the two could go together.<br> Living and being a man.<br> Even in the city I can smell of spring.<br> Smell much better without the city.<br> Cold?<br> You dress too light. -I<br> don't like heavy things.<br> It'll be nice when its<br> really warm in the summer.<br> Cold makes you miserable.<br> Maybe it'll warm you up to drive.<br> I don't know how.<br> If I did, I'd go about<br> the streets every evening.<br> Half awake, half dreaming.<br> Then I wouldn't need anybody else.<br> You'd need someone. In the evening.<br> Yes, its odd. When it turns<br> dark, you need someone.<br> Then I went around the world in<br> freighters. Especially South America.<br> You've been to South<br> America. Tell me about it.<br> There's Rio De Janeiro, Buenos Aires...<br> -Yes, I know. What are they like?<br> You roll on down to Rio<br> Its' wonderful.<br> Then you roll down to Buenos Aires.<br> They have monkeys. No,<br> er..coffee. Monkeys and coffee.<br> What were you doing in South America?<br> I was a gaucho.<br> I had some coffee plantations.<br> One in Rio and one...<br> Now we've left Buenos Aires?<br> Oh yes, we're in Rio now.<br> And whats Rio like? That is<br> outside the coffee and monkeys.<br> It's mostly monkeys and coffee.<br> And crocodiles, and jaguars and<br> orchids. Blooming in the jungle.<br> My, you tell it so wonderfully.<br> Now, I'll never have to go.<br> You really should go. -Can we come to?<br> I've always wanted to get away myself.<br> But first school, you know then the war...<br> Hello Pat. -Hello.<br> You want to hear what he<br> told me about New York.<br> The people go around in<br> solid gold automobiles.<br> Well am I only supposed to talk about<br> school rooms and shell holes and garages?<br> Just in time. My vest.<br> Get me a safety pin will you Gottfried.<br> What do you want the pin<br> for? He's tied from the back.<br> No we can do that with a piece of string.<br> Piece of string? Won't that show? -No,<br> not if you don't take your coat off.<br> That's very important. Remember that.<br> Never take your coat off in the opera.<br> No matter how much you sweat.<br> You can wipe around inside it with a<br> handkerchief. But never take it off.<br> And don't pick your teeth with<br> your thumb. Use your little finger.<br> That alright now? -Yeah, much better.<br> Here slip into my coat.<br> There's a button missing. -Oh yes, I forgot.<br> Remimd me to tell you sometime how I lost it.<br> Here, try mine.<br> Like a glove. -Little tight under the arms.<br> Can't even reach my pocket! -That's<br> going to save you a lot of money.<br> Pants are a little tight too. -You can't<br> dance anyway, they're alright to sit in.<br> Or are they? -Alright, if I sit still.<br> I wish you two were coming along.<br> -We are. My coat and Otto's pants.<br> And this will top you off.<br> The darned thing won't open!<br> Anybody got a tire wrench?<br> Bang it on something.<br> Never mind, I'll carry it for effect.<br> It'll open once it sees<br> the other little hats.<br> He'll be alright. If he does'n t fall apart.<br> Well, Cinderella goes to the ball.<br> Oh, its silly, come back here.<br> I wouldn't trust myself besides that dress.<br> I couldn't afford this dress.<br> It was my last extravagance.<br> Did it make you happy?<br> I don't know yet. I've never worn it before.<br> Why hello Pat! I was hoping to see you.<br> H..Hello, you remember Herr Lohkamp.<br> Hm, oh yes of course, hello.<br> You simply must join us afterwards.<br> We're going to that new American place.<br> The real thing.<br> Bring your friend along.<br> You'll love it. Free champagne.<br> Champagne for everybody.<br> Mineral water for me please.<br> Good boy Erich. -Yes, very good boy.<br> Will you dance?<br> He's very fond of her. Its<br> been a lucky thing for her.<br> These foreign aristocrats haven't much chance<br> these days without someone to cope with.<br> And she fell right off the horse!<br> Think we should go home? It's 2 o'clock.<br> It's 2 o'clock?<br> Let's move onto another place.<br> Pat looks tired.<br> Tired? No,no. You don't<br> know her as long as I have,<br> She doesn't leave parties early.<br> Shall we dance?<br> I really am tired.<br> You haven't danced all night!<br> With me.<br> I don't know anything about this dance.<br> In the war, we all used to dance the waltz.<br> - Let's dance the waltz.<br> I've forgotten all about it.<br> We won't if you don't want to.<br> At least we're not at the table.<br> At least I'm near you.<br> If you aren't going to dance, come sit by me.<br> I've just placed that coat, my<br> grandfather was buried in it!<br> Let's go somewhere else. To the<br> other side, where we can fix it.<br> It's no use Pat.<br> I'm just not... It can't be fixed, I'm sorry.<br> Double rum Alphons.<br> Hello Cinderella! Got both your slippers on?<br> What happened? -Nothing.<br> Sharp midnight I changed back<br> into a garage mechanic, thats all.<br> Where's Pat? -Where she belongs.<br> Ah, she's a rich man's girl, I knew it.<br> Let's forget about it. -I won't<br> have anything said against Pat.<br> Well it's not her fault. She's a<br> rich man's girl. What can Erich do?<br> He could go ahead and get drunk.<br> Bring the bottle Alphons.<br> Pat!<br> What are you doing here?<br> -I think I've been asleep.<br> How did you get here? -I walked.<br> I mean, why are you here at all?<br> It's cold!<br> You're shivering.<br> Rum, cognac, whisky.<br> League of nations, darling.<br> You got drunk because you couldn't<br> dance and you ran away and left me.<br> I don't ever want you<br> to run away and leave me.<br> I'm much warmer now.<br> And this is a lovely time of day.<br> It isn't day, it isn't night.<br> It's the age of eternity.<br> Let's stay right here forever.<br> Between day and night? -The<br> world we were born into.<br> Thats where we belong.<br> You're cold Pat, let me take you home.<br> Take me home? How? I am home.<br> What is it about love that makes a man<br> swallow his food whole instead of chewing it?<br> It all belongs to you. I'm not going<br> to steal, I've already had my lunch.<br> Whats going to happen with you and<br> Pat? -Why should anything happen?<br> You're in love, why don't you get married?<br> We're in love, isn't that enough? -No,<br> you're as fed up with drifting as I am.<br> Somewhere there's a battle<br> going on and I'm not in it.<br> Somewhere there's a home to be<br> made and love to be had.. -Well?<br> Marry Pat. -What can I<br> offer a girl like Pat?<br> Nothing now and nothing to look forward to.<br> Well marry her anyway,<br> you'll at least have that.<br> I have nothing to give her.<br> Now is the right time believe me.<br> Sometimes it comes and goes so quickly<br> that you'd have lost it, forever.<br> Well, whats wrong about Erich?<br> -Nothing is wrong about Erich.<br> Well, he's alright.<br> What are you playing with the<br> hammer? Schubert? -No, Mendelson.<br> I'm being whimsical.<br> Let me give you Erich in a nutshell.<br> He'd look cute in a nutshell,<br> but if you don't mind...<br> Honesty?<br> Take 10% of for South<br> America but that leaves 90%<br> Spirit? All there is.<br> Stick to your music Otto.<br> You're telling me things I know already.<br> Then, why don't you marry<br> him? -He hasn't asked me.<br> He's scared.<br> Why don't you ask him?<br> Now lets have some Beethoven. No, I<br> imagine Wagner's easier with the hammer.<br> Look, you love each other you<br> have everything to love for.<br> There's hope in both of you,<br> and shelter for the future.<br> It wouldn't work.<br> It wouldn't be fair to him.<br> Why not? -I don't know.<br> I guess I was born for irresponsibility.<br> I guess I couldn't take anything seriously.<br> You mustn't ever lie to me Pat.<br> No I mustn't. So don't<br> ask me anymore questions.<br> You're scared.<br> Scared of having any joy in your life because<br> it'll be all the more harder to lose it.<br> You're afraid. -Yes, thats<br> it, lets leave it at that.<br> But now you're not being fair Pat.<br> You've got to think of Erich now.<br> You're being a coward, you're<br> being selfish. -Thats not true.<br> Then what is true Pat?<br> I told you once, I'd been very ill.<br> Well I'm just patched up now.<br> It'll come back.<br> Your lungs?<br> Don't let me marry him<br> please! -But you've got to.<br> He'd want a happiness that<br> would last. A home, children...<br> A future that doesn't exist from day to day.<br> I'm no good.<br> He has a right to more<br> than me. -Then, live Pat!<br> Take that gamble. Stake your life<br> on a love like yours and Erich's.<br> I'd have to tell him.<br> No, thats a part of it. Don't<br> make him afraid, make him happy!<br> Aim at the stars.<br> I wonder if they mind we aimed at them.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I now pronounce you, man and wife.<br> Do you believe in prayer? -No, I believe<br> in tomorrow that will follow today.<br> And that tomorrow will find<br> you even happier, both of you.<br> She's too good for you, you<br> know that. -Much too good.<br> He's too good for you, you know<br> that. -I know nothing of the kind.<br> Everybody's too good for everybody<br> else. I can hardly wait to get drunk.<br> Remember that happy life you were<br> going to come back to from the war?<br> It's starting now. -I'm sure of that, Otto.<br> We'll see to it. All<br> four of us will see to it.<br> Alphons, it was the most<br> wonderful wedding ever. Thank you.<br> Bring on the pork chops!<br> What does the meter read? -318 Marks.<br> You'll never be able to pay it.<br> -Don't worry, I know the driver.<br> He's a husband of mine.<br> Oh, Erich look the sea!<br> Is that the hotel? -No, it can't<br> be, it looks just like the postcard.<br> You know who were now?<br> Herr and Frau Erich Lohkamp.<br> He has a nice way of putting things. For<br> better or worse was one of his phrases.<br> And what's this er..and sickness<br> and in health, till death do us part.<br> Now, there you see,<br> you're bored. -No, I'm not.<br> You soon will be.<br> What on earth are we going to talk<br> about for the rest of our lives? -You!<br> Oh, we couldn't talk, we'd have to sing.<br> Books and music? -I don't<br> anything about books or music.<br> I'll teach you, its high time you<br> went to school. -I went to school.<br> I was taught how to keep<br> a machine gun from jamming.<br> Prove why its better to shoot a<br> man in the stomach than in the head.<br> We'll have a garden full of flowers in the...<br> I can show you the quickest way to bury a...<br> I can teach you to swim and drive a car,<br> and to climb mountains and play tennis.<br> I didn't know I didn't till now.<br> I thought I belonged to<br> something that was dead and gone.<br> Now I realise I am alive.<br> With you, I'm alive. -We're alive darling.<br> And I'm glad.<br> Maybe I can't learn all those things.<br> Maybe you're in love with just a fragment.<br> -And a lovely fragment if there ever was one.<br> Oh, Erich I love you so.<br> I've just been kissed. Can you<br> tell me which was is the ocean?<br> Shh, listen, a cuckoo bird.<br> That makes three of us.<br> I'm counting, everytime he calls you<br> have that many number of years to live.<br> There's a better one than that. When a cuckoo<br> calls rattle your money and then it multiplies.<br> Only I haven't got any money to rattle.<br> So the cuckoo is making a fool of himself.<br> Imagine, our silver wedding.<br> Our handsome son has left<br> college. He refuses to go to war,<br> and is thrown into jail<br> for the rest of his life.<br> A sweet, silver haired old couple.<br> We'll come back tomorrow<br> and count cuckoos all day.<br> Here try this, best way to get sand off.<br> Is she alright, is she better?<br> -Where was your wife being treated?<br> Who was her doctor? -Doctor?<br> She must've had a doctor<br> for this. -I don't know.<br> Jaffe? Prof. Phoenix Jaffe?<br> You must get in touch with<br> him at once by the telephone.<br> Yes but can't you tell me is she..<br> -She must start breathing at once.<br> Dr.Jaffe's left? But I've got to get it in<br> touch with him, its a matter of life and death.<br> Have him ring here as soon as he comes in.<br> I'll find him and I'll ring you here<br> again. Don't worry Erich, I'll find him.<br> Jaffe. -I'll go, I'll<br> have to talk to him anyway.<br> Koster's gone to fetch Jaffe.<br> You'll be alright soon.<br> There's a friend of yours, Lenz. They found him. Lenz<br> told me Jaffe's instructions very clear, in detail.<br> Is he a doctor too? -He was a soldier.<br> He said Koster had already left with Jaffe<br> and they'd be here in 2 hours by automobile.<br> Thats impossible. Its a long<br> distance and I know the roads.<br> Full of dents and fog.<br> It'll take at least 3 hours. -If<br> Koster's said 2 hours, it will be 2 hours.<br> You're going very fast. -Can<br> you stop the haemorrhage?<br> Yes, if we get there in time.<br> Has it stopped yet? -No.<br> There'll be here in half an hour. -An<br> hour at least, maybe two in this fog.<br> You're risking both our<br> lives. Is she your girl? -No.<br> You're crazy.<br> They're coming, I can hear them.<br> Impossible, it must be some other car.<br> You can't fool me, thats Baby.<br> How is she? -I don't know, so<br> much has happened so quickly.<br> She'll be alright now. Give me a cigarette.<br> Nice of you to come up, Otto. -Nice<br> trip, not bad, only one patch of fog.<br> She never told me, not a word. She never<br> worried about herself, only to make me happy.<br> I thought nothing ever would<br> happen to a girl like that.<br> Give me another cigarette. I forgot mine.<br> She safe? -Think I'd be<br> standing here if she wasn't?<br> I'm sorry, it was so quick. -She's his wife.<br> I hope you're less a fool than she<br> is. She's been one all her life.<br> May I go in now? -Only for<br> a moment and no talking.<br> Was it right to bring you? -Yes.<br> Serious? -No more when<br> she gets back to town.<br> One thing is for sure, tell your friend. She has<br> to go to a sanatorium by mid-October at the latest.<br> She'll go. When are you going back to town?<br> -None of your business. I'm going by train.<br> Everything's over now, Pat. Just be quiet.<br> Erich.<br> You mustn't be afraid.<br> -We'll never be afraid.<br> You mustn't cry about us Pat.<br> We're not unhappy. Soon you'll<br> be well and then we'll be happier.<br> I love you<br> Mid-October at the very latest.<br> Well? -If the right fron tire<br> lasts, we'll break even this week.<br> Don't count on that tire.<br> It blew twice this morning.<br> When Pat went walking, the sun came out.<br> - You know, I thought about that.<br> I saw the sun come out<br> and I thought about Pat.<br> It's a step forward you know,<br> when she can walk out alone.<br> I'll drop you on the way to station. You<br> wait here till the delivery comes home.<br> Well you can't keep moping about Pat.<br> Make her laugh, we'll pull through.<br> Who knows, maybe Erich will get a fine job.<br> What makes you think an<br> automobile can go through you?<br> I represent Koster and Co. the best fastest<br> and cheapest repair shop in the city.<br> You'll be very happy.<br> Boy,<br> I saw the whole thing,<br> you're a... -Nobody asked you.<br> Here, call this number, tell him we have a<br> repair job and tell him to come as fast as he can.<br> You'll have it as good as new in 2<br> days. -It was good as new 5 minutes ago!<br> Before you wrecked it. -Lets not quibble.<br> Materials and cost, labor and standard<br> rate, plus our profit of 200 Marks.<br> Settle for a 100.<br> Here's your claim check. Get your<br> car on Wednesday night at 6 o'clock.<br> oh, by the way, you hurt?<br> -No, no, thank you asking.<br> You, the owner of this car? -No, I'm<br> one of the men whose going to repair it.<br> Koster and company.<br> -Now, isnt that peculiar?<br> I was just telling my partner, here's a car<br> that's just begging to be repaired by us.<br> Sorry, you're already too late, I've<br> already got an order from the owner.<br> Hand it over. -Don't be silly.<br> Hey, we've talked enough. Lets<br> dump this monkey down the sewer.<br> Make it the sewer you live<br> in. -Well you asked for it..<br> You certainly must give it to<br> Erich. He's a natural born fighter.<br> How many were there Erich? -14.<br> Yeah, by the time we arrived they were<br> all worn out from chasing your husband.<br> My husband? I've never seen<br> that face before in all my life.<br> There he was striking right and left. He<br> knocked out a little boy all by himself.<br> Now, I'm beginning to understand. He got the job<br> first and you three surrounded him and beat him up.<br> Lets talk about you for a change.<br> Where did you walk? -Oh, I just<br> walked and walked, thats all.<br> Walking is a pretty big event for<br> me, it doesn't really matter where.<br> Everything about you matters. You<br> two go on ahead and start on the car.<br> Queen Solomon!<br> And all that trouble just for a 100 Marks.<br> - Its the easiest money that we've ever earned.<br> Its been a slow summer.<br> And what do I give?<br> What can I ever give? -Just<br> being here, thats what.<br> And don't talk about things not mattering.<br> Where you walk, we three walk beside you now.<br> Winter is coming again, it is<br> the time for storm and tempest.<br> It is the time and nature<br> itself that is all confusion.<br> And given over to violence. And<br> so too are the people confused.<br> Looking in all directions, and<br> in vain. For the peace and hope,<br> which was to have been<br> their's at the end of the war.<br> But there has been no end to the war.<br> How can we look for<br> peace? And how can we hope?<br> As long as we use violence and terror to<br> supply what must come from sanity and reason.<br> There is and there will be, a<br> solution, a cure for all your ills.<br> Winter is coming outside.<br> No, not yet. You only think<br> that because of the wind.<br> Its been windy so long now.<br> Sometimes at night, I<br> dream of being blown away.<br> When I think of my life as it was before,<br> I thank God for you.<br> It sounds lovely when you say that.<br> Say it again. -I thank God for you.<br> From now on, I'm going to say<br> that every 10 seconds for the week.<br> Say it when I'm asleep too.<br> Then I won't dream.<br> The phone for Herr Lohkamp.<br> -Oh, thank you, Erich.<br> How can she stand the trip? What<br> trip? -The trip to the sanatorium.<br> I told her a week ago, she must leave.<br> If you want to keep that girl<br> alive, you send her off today.<br> And I mean, today.<br> She'll go today.<br> Goodbye Doctor.<br> You should've told me Pat. -No, I couldn't,<br> We've been so happyand its<br> been such a short week with you.<br> Such a long week away.<br> We'll have other weeks later.<br> You better start packing.<br> We stole a week and they can't take it back.<br> Its mine to keep forever.<br> Why won't you please say it twice?<br> Its been at least 20 seconds.<br> I thank God for you Pat.<br> Thank God for you.<br> Oh Tony, hello! Where's your<br> sister? -She isn't coming Pat.<br> How do you know all these<br> people? -From 2 years ago,<br> We're all at the same sanatorium. All the<br> birds migrate at this time of the year.<br> They can't be so bad.<br> And in spring you'll be home<br> again, all brown from the sun.<br> Did you pack your silver dress? You<br> are magic when you wear that dress,<br> Don't wear it for anyone else. -i<br> haven't got magic for anyone else.<br> You're behaving beautifully Pat.<br> Whats the good of anything?<br> I've been so proud of you the whole day.<br> Its only this bad the day you leave.<br> Then everything becomes alright again.<br> I haven't been brave all day, you<br> just didn't notice it, thats all.<br> So long as you don't give in, you're<br> bigger than what happens to you.<br> Where are Otto and Gottfried?<br> These are from Gottfried, with regrets<br> and love. -They're lovely, give him mine.<br> I hope he isn't in any trouble with all<br> this fighting in the streets and the crowds..<br> Don't look now, either of you. Turn around.<br> What happened to Gottfried? -Come on.<br> He's in that warehouse. We've got to get him.<br> Gottfried! Its Otto, can you hear me?<br> I took a long time.<br> But I've finally made up my mind.<br> Was he your comrade?<br> He was mine too.<br> Maybe we should've told the police.<br> -The police have nothing to do with this.<br> They haven't lost Gottfried, we have.<br> Dr.Ploughton asked me to<br> pick you up, if I found you.<br> What news from the village?<br> -Christmas is coming.<br> Christmas makes you think<br> of home. -Yes, yes it does.<br> If you have no home, you think of it anyway.<br> Or the home that you might've had.<br> To get on a plane there, to the<br> next village, to go somewhere.<br> You have a husband, is he<br> coming? -We're very poor.<br> You're poor? -Very poor.<br> You mustn't think of the cost of an<br> operation that may give you a new life.<br> Perhaps it isn't my responsibility<br> to sign a new lease of life.<br> What are you going to do to me?<br> We often get splendid results with<br> this operation with cases of your kind.<br> We take a little bit of bone from<br> your ribs and collapse your lung,<br> There is no real danger after, except<br> that you must keep very still for 2 weeks.<br> Very still.<br> When do you operate? -Right after Christmas.<br> That means I'll be here for that<br> long. -Please don't talk that way.<br> Forigve me, it's just Christmas.<br> Koster been in this evening? -No, not yet.<br> He's a hard man to keep<br> track of, here taste this.<br> He's out now, looking for him. He's a<br> crazy man. -Thats a job for both of us.<br> No, he's right. You've got Pat to think of.<br> To think of? You can't<br> hold a thought in your arms.<br> Play for us, Erich.<br> Here's a present for you, came 3 days ago.<br> She told me to hide it, I put it in the icebox.<br> Erich, you were going to play for us.<br> Gottfried gone.<br> Pat, a million miles away.<br> I wish Koster were here.<br> I still say it was a job for both of us.<br> If you'd be standing beside<br> me, he'd have hit you.<br> Go open your telegram.<br> Anybody see you? -He fired<br> first anyway it was self-defence.<br> How long since you heard from<br> her? -Less than a week, why?<br> Better get her on the phone right away.<br> I'm so glad you called. No, I'm in my room.<br> They want me to rest up. They want me<br> to have a little operation next week.<br> Operation?<br> What for? What kind? -Seems<br> like I don't need so many ribs.<br> It isn't really dangerous, but<br> I... just wanted to hear your voice.<br> Koster and I will leave tonight.<br> In Baby.<br> We'll be there before tomorrow night.<br> We thought you'd be in bed.<br> I'm grateful to Baby, I love her. I didn't think<br> I'd ever deserve it but I'm getting in here.<br> Don't ever leave me. Tell me if you're ever<br> leaving me again. -I'm never leaving you.<br> I'm outta gas!<br> Took your time in picking me<br> up. I was freezing to death!<br> She behaving herself? -In a way,<br> too wild, too many cocktails.<br> Cigarettes. -Without nicotine.<br> Coffee. -Without caffine.<br> Dancing. -Without..you.<br> That must be terrible. -Herr<br> Lohkamp can I talk a minute?<br> And how's Gottfried?<br> -He is..he couldn't come.<br> And Erich? He still love<br> me? -He loves you Pat.<br> Yes, he loves me terribly.<br> After the operation she'll have<br> to lie very still for a few weeks.<br> Sudden movement may prove fatal.<br> Things haven't gone so well, have they?<br> -It would be much worse staying in the city.<br> I didn't realise it would be so expensive.<br> We'll get the money somehow.<br> Is that the road home?<br> In May, you'll be going home<br> along that route. -In May.<br> This isn't what we're supposed<br> to say this first time together.<br> All this while, I'd figured out what<br> I'd say and you'd say, word to word.<br> Do you want to hear?<br> We'd be lying on this bed just like this.<br> I'd say 'Is that the road home?'<br> You'd say 'Yes, its 600 kilometers.'<br> And I'd say that doesn't matter now.<br> We love each other beyond time and place now.<br> You'd say, 'That's right.'<br> Then you'd kiss me.<br> You'd say,' Ought I to be in this<br> room now? 'Are we breaking the rules?'<br> And I'd say,'Mustn't I start<br> now? By not breaking them?'<br> Because I can't let you go.<br> And suddenly it would all be so real.<br> He gave me an estimate.<br> Over a 1000 marks? What are we going<br> to do? We got to get it but how?<br> I can make the city by tomorrow.<br> -How are you going to raise the money?<br> I'll get it.<br> You forget all about it.<br> Forget about everything but Pat tonight.<br> - Don't do something crazy Otto.<br> The silver dress!<br> Service is right. They<br> belonged to a couple of waiters.<br> My wife gave me some dancing lessons.<br> May I try them out on you, Ma'am?<br> I'd adore it. I adore your wife.<br> How did she ever happen to marry you?<br> May I go in now? -Yes.<br> Herr Koster wants to see you.<br> Been here a long time?<br> -I've been and come back.<br> Just to see me? -Just to see you.<br> I'm taking the train back<br> to the city this afternoon.<br> The train? Why didn't you come in Baby?<br> Um..er..the roads too rough.<br> You sold Baby. -No,Pat. What made you...<br> You're not to lie to me Otto.<br> She was about to fall of<br> anyway. Nothing but an old wreck.<br> You sold Baby.<br> To buy me a sweepstake ticket. -The<br> important thing is how do you feel?<br> I feel alright.<br> I think they took my backbone out by mistake.<br> You've got enough for two anyway.<br> Kept pretending I had a child.<br> Must be nice to leave a<br> part of yourself behind.<br> For a moment I'd be there.<br> I don't understand it Otto.<br> Why two people should love like Erich and me,<br> and yet one die?<br> I've been lying here alone for so<br> many hours, I've figured it out.<br> If you asked yourselves,<br> Perhaps I might live a few months longer.<br> If you sold your repair<br> shop, a few more weeks.<br> Perhaps if you sold your fingers, one by one.<br> The blood in your veins,<br> the marrow in your bones.<br> Perhaps even a year or two.<br> So that I could still breathe a little.<br> My heart still beat.<br> For what Otto?<br> A dead dragging weight.<br> So that I could look at Erich<br> and know I'd grown old and ugly.<br> We'll all grow old and ugly.<br> To me, the happiness I never<br> would know. To Erich, his life.<br> And what have I given to Gottfried?<br> - Gottfried...<br> He's dead isn't he?<br> How did he die? -Bravely.<br> He did what he thought was right.<br> Thats honourable to die bravely and proudly.<br> Well, I'll get my bag.<br> Lets not go back to the city,<br> lets.. go to South America.<br> Can we start now?<br> Its the deck of a boat in the morning.<br> No no, its evening.<br> I'm making eyes at the native<br> girls and you're getting mad.<br> And I'll always be very<br> strong and never tired.<br> I'll never want to sleep.<br> Because life would be too good to sleep away.<br> We'll travel up the Amazon, at<br> the end there'll be a mud village.<br> and a little thatched hut with<br> our names on them and we'll go in.<br> Once we're in, we'd just sit. -And<br> I'd look at you and you'd look at me.<br> I'll go see Otto off. I'll be back.<br> Erich!<br> Its been so much more than 10 seconds.<br> Thank God for you Pat.<br> It ticks too loud.<br> Its not ticking anymore.<br> Time is standing still.<br> Its right for me to die, darling.<br> It does hurt, but I'm so full of love.<br> South America is so very far away.<br> I wish they were going with us.<br> There's fighting in the city.<br> SUBS by suyash for pittacuss99.<br> English subs for KG-June 2009.<br>
