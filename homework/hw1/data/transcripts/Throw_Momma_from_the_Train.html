Look at her! Slut!<br> - Hey! Hey, man, your wife's on TV!<br> - Ex-wife, Lester. Ex-wife.<br> - She looks good!<br> - Criminals don't age. It's a common fact.<br> - What the hell do you want?<br> - Something for a gig.<br> - You got anything in green?<br> - You borrowed all my green.<br> It is a lot more difficult for women<br> to get themselves published...<br> How about women thieves, Oprah?<br> Big difference.<br> I would say that, once I was divorced, ...<br> . . blissfully divorced, ...<br> . . a freedom overcame me, and I was<br> allowed to be the writer, the artist, ...<br> . . that I was never allowed to be within<br> the confines of my prison-like marriage.<br> Did you think about writing<br> when you were with this beast?<br> - Well, I did. I did, yes.<br> -<br> Because he fancied himself<br> a sort of a hack writer.<br> I watched him at the typewriter and<br> thought: Oh, God, I can do that in spades.<br> Then did, clearly.<br> How do you think he will feel now<br> about your success?<br> - Frankly, I don't really care how he feels.<br> -<br> - Well, Margaret...<br> -<br> So she stole your book.<br> Write another one and forget it.<br> - I am writing.<br> - Oh, you're writing?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Yeah, right!

And I want it back!<br> "Hot Fire", ladies and gentlemen. Thank<br> you so much for being on the show.<br> - My pleasure.<br> - I want it back!<br> - Owen!<br> -<br> Owen!<br> Owen!<br> Owen!

"<br> "'Yeah' said the captain. "<br> "'We foiled those bastards again,<br> didn't we, Dave?'"<br> "'Yeah' said Dave. "<br> "The end. "<br> OK.<br> Here we have all the elements of drama.<br> We have the tension, the horror of war...<br> Uh... Mrs Hazeltine, when you're writing<br> a novel that takes place on a submarine, ...<br> . . it's not a bad idea to know<br> the name of the instrument...<br> . . that the captain speaks through.<br> - I used to know that.<br> - And your similes... need a little work.<br> "His guts oozed nice<br> like a melted malted. "<br> Well, it's, um... a little...<br> - Too harsh?<br> - A tad.<br> Otherwise it was, um...<br> . . very good, it was, uh...<br> . . very real.<br> Here's another one.<br> This is a real classic by Mr Pinsky.<br> It's entitled 100 Girls I'd Like to Pork.<br> Pork?<br> It's a coffee-table book.<br> "Chapter 1 : Kathleen Turner.

"<br> "Chapter 7: Chris... "<br> Mr Pinsky, this is not literature.<br> Well, you know,<br> I would put in photographs, ...<br> . . a brief character sketch,<br> like a biography, ...<br> . . and a nice dust jacket.<br> - Mr Pinsky, what is this?<br> - It's... Iiterature. It's a fantasy.<br> Like Melville. This is<br> my great white whale.<br> - It's whacking material.<br> - lsn't that literature?<br> How do you associate Moby Dick to a list<br> of women you'd like to have sex with?<br> - I think it's brave.<br> - He's vulgar.<br> - They said Twain was.<br> - I'm saying he is.<br> - I think you're vulgar.<br> - You're a no-talent shit.<br> - Maybe I should change the title.<br> - I like the title.<br> -<br> - OK, I'll see you Wednesday, class.<br> Good work today. Remember,<br> a writer writes... always.<br> Argh! Oh!<br> - This is your tie.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - You dropped it.<br> - Oh. How'd that get in there?<br> It got wet. I was afraid it would be ruined.<br> Thanks.<br> - Hi. I'm Owen.<br> - I know.<br> Why didn't you read my story in class?<br> - Your story?<br> - Yeah. Murder at my Friend Harry's.<br> Why didn't you read it?<br> - I did.<br> - You did? What'd you think of it?<br> It's raining, lrwin.<br> Can't we discuss it tomorrow?<br> Owen. Didn't you like it?<br> - Well... no. No, I didn't.<br> - Why not?<br> It was three pages long.<br> It was a murder mystery...<br> . . that, by the way, was no big trick<br> in finding the murderer.<br> - What gave it away?<br> - You only had two characters, ...<br> . . one of which was dead on page two!<br> Well, one guy killed the other guy.<br> - It wasn't motivated!<br> - Sure it was.<br> A guy in a hat killed<br> the other guy in a hat.<br> I have to go now, Owen.<br> Thanks.<br> -<br> - Hi, Beth.

Bye.<br> So Margaret's a big star. That's life.<br> This is life, too.<br> That goes on, this goes on.<br> Hm.<br> The night was hot.<br> Wait, no. The night... The night was...<br> . . humid! The night was humid.<br> No, wait. Hot. Hot! The night was hot.<br> The night was hot and wet. Wet and hot.<br> The night was wet and hot... hot and wet...<br> That's humid. The night was humid.<br> Maybe the night isn't humid.<br> Maybe... the night isn't humid.<br> Maybe it was humid in the morning and<br> at night it was cold. That gives you fog.<br> Ha! The night was foggy.<br> The night... The night was...<br> The night was...<br> The night... The night was dry,<br> yet it was raining.<br> The... The... The...<br> The streets were wet, ...<br> . . but the night... was as bright...<br> . . as... the...<br> . . earrings in Margaret Donner's ears!<br> My God! I'm goin' outta my mind!<br> Fuck it!<br> The... night... was... humid!<br> That's it and that's all.<br> Stop it, dammit!<br> I got a wax ball in my ear. Get it out.<br> - Momma!<br> - You were writing to her, weren't you?<br> Don't start that again, Momma.<br> And don't hit me!<br> - You love her.<br> - There's no "her", Momma.<br> - You were writing a letter.<br> - I'm writin' a story for class, Momma.<br> - I take a class. I take a nice class.<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> - And I'm gonna be a writer some day.<br> - You know how that typing upsets me.<br> I'm sorry, Momma. A writer writes.<br> You're gonna be nothing.<br> You're gonna be nothing.<br> You'll never get to first base.<br> All you do is type, type, type, type, type!<br> You sit there typing all day<br> like a fat little pigeon.<br> You won't ever hear it again, Momma.<br> I promise.<br> Aarrghhh!<br> - Momma...<br> - I think you got it, sonny.<br> I don't know what I'd do<br> without you, Owen baby.<br> - I know, Momma.<br> - Owen, my little baby.<br> - I know.<br> - Owen, my little baby boy.<br> And even though<br> he was mortally wounded, ...<br> . . the guy in the hat got up...<br> . . and pulled himself up and...<br> . . staggered out into the dark night...<br> . . Iike a milkman...<br> . . going out on his route.<br> There he is, Owen.<br> - Professor Donner...<br> - Not now, Owen. Another time.<br> - Beth...<br> - Don't bother.<br> - I gotta talk to you.<br> - You're 16 hours late.<br> And I'm sorry. It's just that...<br> she was on the television.<br> Margaret was on TV<br> and my mind went nuts.<br> My mind went crazy. I saw<br> nothing but hate and death.<br> And I'm sorry, and I did call.<br> I called you around 10. 30.<br> - Where were you?<br> - Did you think I'd stay in all night...<br> . . staring at my tandoori chicken?<br> I know you're angry<br> and... you have every right to be angry.<br> It's just that l...<br> - It's my class.<br> - Ah. How do you do?<br> Hi.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Beth Ryan.<br> She teaches anthropology.<br> Beth... Ryan?<br> Don't even think about it.<br> Hang in there, Pinsky.<br> Come on. I'm sorry. Do you know that<br> we are this far away from having a date?<br> We're just this far.<br> - Hello, you're late.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - You probably made tandoori chicken.<br> - Come on in, Larry. Oh...<br> Come on, gimme a second chance.<br> What do you say? Come on!<br> - I can't believe I'm saying this. Yes.<br> - Yeah? Great!<br> Professor Donner,<br> I saw your wife on Oprah!<br> Ex-wife. Ex!<br> What's with him?<br> I can't get over this.<br> - Why?<br> - Why? Why?!<br> She steals my book! OK?<br> - She goes on national television...<br> - I'm not gonna sit here and be barked at.<br> Wait. Listen to me, Beth. The problem is...<br> . . I can't write. I'm dead inside.<br> I have no passion.<br> You have passion. When you talk<br> about Margaret, you have passion.<br> Slut!<br> No, my ex-wife is a major slut.<br> - But you're not a slut.<br> - Thank you!<br> I'm talking about passion!<br> It's selfless, committed, overflowing!<br> Not hate and murder!<br> And slut! I hate her! I wish she was dead!<br> Chill out.<br> Thank you.<br> It's so beautiful!<br> It's very good, Phil. Very, very good.<br> Forty yards of Naugahyde, a girl<br> and a dream. What can I say? It's...<br> Well, I wrote it just like I lived it.<br> Which is what you've been<br> teaching us: to write what we know.<br> It's very good. It'll blow the lid off<br> the upholstery business as we know it.<br> - Thank you.<br> - OK.<br> Next is Murder at my Friend Harry's<br> by Owen... Lift.<br> "Chapter 1. The night was humid. "<br> Class dismissed.<br> I have an enormous headache in my eye.<br> Yuck.<br> OWEN<br> I'm so sorry about the cafeteria.<br> It was Norman Bates in concert.<br> It's just that I see her and l...<br> - You wanna kill her.<br> - Metaphorically, yes.<br> Specifically, without a doubt.<br> - I'm glad you called.<br> - Me, too.<br> I like trains.<br> Every great romance or mystery<br> has a train in it.<br> - Is this gonna be a great romance?<br> - Could be.<br> We have a train, we have the moon,<br> we have compatible body parts.<br> - Would you like to kiss me?<br> - I don't know.<br> You don't know?<br> Oh, you're so sweet, Beth.<br> Oh, Larry, would you like to date me?<br> - This isn't a date?<br> - Mmm... I was speaking euphemistically.<br> - So you're... you're saying... ?<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> So you're saying... ?<br> Yeah, you are. I can feel that.<br> - You're saying no?<br> - Kids are gonna sit here tomorrow.<br> - I wanna make love to you, Beth.<br> - Oh, Larry...<br> Sometime in the very near future.<br> - Huh?<br> - I can't.<br> - What?<br> - I have writer's block.<br> - Everywhere?<br> - Yeah. It's no good. I can't.<br> - On the train?<br> - Oh, I wanna ring the bell.<br> - Oh, take me, Casey.<br> - Who?<br> - Take me, Casey.<br> - I'm taking you, I'm taking you.<br> - Hi.<br> - Oh, God!<br> Do you know Owen?<br> This is Owen. Owen is a dead man.<br> - Did I come at a bad time?<br> - Owen... I'm dating.<br> You read it, right? My story?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good.<br> Owen, you cannot follow me around<br> asking me questions.<br> This stuff belongs in the classroom.<br> Not on my time. Do you understand me?<br> Oh.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Good night, Miss Ryan.<br> - Did you like it?<br> - No!<br> Why didn't you like it?<br> Because in a novel people have to have<br> more of a reason to commit a murder.<br> If they just do it because they're crazy,<br> it's not strong enough for a novel.<br> You mean, if someone ruined you<br> permanently, then you could murder 'em?<br> Yes. Which brings us to the second point.<br> The motive: you have to eliminate it.<br> - Eliminate the motive.<br> - Correct. I'll give you an example.<br> My ex-wife. I hate her guts, right?<br> Yeah. I overheard you in the cafeteria.<br> She really ruined you.<br> Yes, she did. And I hate her with<br> a passion. But I would never murder her.<br> - You'd get caught.<br> - Absolutely right.<br> I would get caught because<br> I have a motive and people know that.<br> I got a similar problem with my momma.<br> Well, look at this, Owen. This is amazing.<br> You and I have something in common.<br> - We do?<br> - Absolutely. Think about what I'm saying.<br> And then you just draw on<br> your own personal experiences.<br> You mean... how do you murder<br> and not get caught?<br> So how do you not get caught?<br> Owen? How do you not get caught?<br> By eliminating the motive<br> and establishing an alibi.<br> - How?<br> - I can't tell you everything. I don't know.<br> - Go see a Hitchcock film.<br> - Wanna go to the movies with me?<br> No, I don't wanna go to the movies.<br> It's real late and l...<br> I'm gonna go now.<br> You're gonna be fine. OK?<br> - Thank you, Professor Donner.<br> - Good night, Owen.<br> Eliminate the motive.<br> Eliminate...<br> Elim...<br> Eliminate the motive.<br> Motive.<br> Hitchcock.<br> Let's say that you'd like<br> to get rid ofyour wife.<br> Let's say that you have<br> a very good reason.<br> - No, let's not...<br> - No, no. Let's say.<br> You'd be afraid to kill her.<br> You know why? You'd get caught.<br> And what would trip you up? The motive.<br> Ah. Now here's my idea.<br> It's so simple, too.<br> Two fellows meet accidentally,<br> like you and me.<br> Each one has somebody<br> that he'd like to get rid of.<br> So... they swap murders.<br> - Swap murders?<br> - Each fellow does the other's murder.<br> Then there's nothing to connect them.<br> Each one has murdered a total stranger.<br> Like... you do my murder, I do yours.<br> Your wife, my father. Crisscross.<br> Some people are better off dead.<br> Each one has murdered a total stranger.<br> They swap murders.<br> You do my murder. Crisscross.<br> I do yours.<br> They swap murders. Crisscross.<br> Crisscross.<br> "Choo-Choo Charlie said<br> to himself: I think I can. I know I can. "<br> "He opened up his throttle and pushed<br> and pulled and pushed and pulled...<br> . . and it spluttered some more<br> and then... and then he... and then... "<br> - How's that blockage problem?<br> - All aboard!<br> - Woo-woo!<br> -<br> No, no. Don't. Don't.<br> - I'm buying a gun, Owen.<br> - You must wonder what happened to me.<br> - Uh... no, not at all.<br> - I saw that movie.<br> Uh-huh, uh-huh.<br> I know now what you tried to tell me,<br> Professor Donner.<br> - Oh, good.<br> - Crisscross.<br> Owen!<br> - I'll call you in a few days, pal.<br> - Take your time, Owen. OK?<br> - Bye.<br> - Owen!<br> - Coming, Momma!<br> - Who were you talking to?<br> - I just called the weather.<br> - You were talking to a machine?<br> Two minutes ago<br> you were my agent, and now...<br> Larry, I'm sorry.<br> That's the way the mop flops.<br> After seven years I get<br> "That's the way the mop flops"?<br> Larry, you must feel like this is<br> the lowest point of your entire life.<br> Arnie, what are you doing?<br> Don't bend the fern. Fluff it!<br> How, as a human being, can you give up<br> on somebody after seven years?<br> Larry, this is a whole other agency.<br> Besides, you've never written anything.<br> What about Hot Fire?<br> This may be a tad bit disturbing, but<br> we've just signed your wife on as a client.<br> Get me a doctor, Joel.<br> I'm having a heart attack.<br> The book sold two million copies! Arnie...<br> But I wrote that and you know that!<br> Arnie knows that!<br> Margaret couldn't write<br> her name in the snow!<br> Larry, for seven years I've given you<br> assignments. I've made your deals.<br> And for seven years<br> you didn't want to "compromise your art"!<br> Oh, boy. It is just like an agent<br> to think that a writer can't be an artist.<br> - Don't change the subject. Where was l?<br> - You were letting me go.<br> Thank you.<br> For four years you've been writing<br> a novel no one has ever seen.<br> So you get the shaft from your wife.<br> It's another excuse for not writing.<br> Well, go ahead, Larry! Go! Go to Mexico!<br> Write your heart out! Andele, arriba!<br> But I handle writers, Larry, not artists.<br> You go be an artist.<br> Let the rest of the world make a living.<br> Here. It's my favourite fuchsia.<br> Live and be well.<br> That's the house. This is good here.<br> - I'll be right back. I'm gonna visit my aunt.<br> - OK, bro.<br> -<br> - Oh, shit.<br> Why, Mr Lopez.<br> Can I borrow that... towel?<br> My big Chihuahua.<br> - Oh!<br> -<br> Grrr! Ruff, ruff!<br> Ruff, ruff! Ruff! Grrr!<br> Ruff, ruff, ruff!<br> - Ruff! Ruff!<br> -<br> - Ruff, ruff!<br> - Hello?<br> Oh, hi, Joel. It's my agent.<br> - Ruff!<br> - My agente.<br> How's LA, darling?<br> Oh, nothing much. I'm having<br> a little trouble with the... gardener.<br> - Ruff... ruff...<br> - What sound, sweetie?<br> Oh, that's the... the TV.<br> - Ruff! Ru-ruff!<br> - Uh... Old Yeller.<br> Yes, I know they shot him in the end.<br> Huh? Yes, darling.<br> I'm aware of the book signing<br> tonight... in Maui.<br> I'll be there. Kiss, kiss.<br> -<br> - Bye, Mr Lopez.<br> Last boat to Maui!<br> This is my first trip to the islands.<br> Oh!<br> Oh, my God!<br> The night...<br> . . was... n't.<br> Oy.<br> There's probably halibut right here<br> who could write better than me.<br> Boy. The night was...<br> If you got a line, fish, just yell it out.<br> I'm up for grabs.<br> -<br> - Perfect.<br> What about Brenda Lee?<br> You like Brenda Lee?<br> - The jockey?<br> - No.<br> - Cloudy.<br> - Aloha.<br> - What?<br> - I said aloha.<br> - Hello.<br> - Professor Donner?<br> - Hello?<br> - Hello!<br> - Hello.<br> - Professor Donner, stay by the phone.<br> I don't want 'em<br> to be able to trace the call.<br> - Who is this?<br> - Professor Donner?<br> - Aloha! Hello!<br> - Who is this?<br> It's Owen!<br> - Owen?<br> - Yeah, from class!<br> What do you want?<br> It's done. You want anything from Hawaii?<br> - Hawaii?<br> - Wiki-wiki.<br> Aloha 'oe<br> - What are you doing in Hawaii?<br> - Crisscross. You know.<br> Owen, I'm hanging up on you now.<br> Oh, yeah, right! I got ya!<br> Boy, are you smart!<br> She didn't feel a thing.<br> I know how important that is to you.<br> - Who?<br> - Your wife.<br> She had a little trouble walkin',<br> but that was from the gardener.<br> - You saw my wife?<br> - She was kind of a tart, Larry.<br> But I can see why you married her.<br> She was very beautiful.<br> Owen, you stay away from my wife.<br> Did you hear what I said, Owen?<br> You stay away from my wife.<br> - I told you, it's done. Nobody saw.<br> - What the hell are you talking about?<br> Crisscross, like in the movie. Done!<br> Owen, what the hell<br> did you do to my wife?<br> I... I don't wanna say on the phone.<br> All I can tell you is<br> that I killed her last night.<br> My God! Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Owen, what the hell did you do?<br> Tell me the truth.<br> Meet me tonight at 7. 30 at<br> Mulholland Drive and Cahuenga Pass.<br> - We'll discuss your end ofthe bargain.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - You gotta kill my mother.<br> - Kill your mother?!<br> - Owen, l...<br> -<br> Crisscross... Criss...<br> Holy shit. He did it.<br> He did it! The little bastard did it!<br> He killed my wi... No, he didn't do it.<br> He couldn't poss... No, he didn't do it.<br> I'll call her up, call her up on the phone.<br> She'll answer the phone,<br> I'll hang up, and she won't be dead.<br> That's it and that's all.<br> Come on, come on, Margaret. Answer<br> the phone. Answer the phone, Margaret.<br> Why the hell isn't she<br> answering the phone?<br> Because she's dead. That's why<br> she's not answering the phone.<br> You don't answer the phone<br> when you're dead!<br> They're gonna think I did it.<br> They're gonna think that I did it!<br> Why would they think that I did it?<br> Because I hate her guts!<br> That's why they'll think<br> that I did it. My God...<br> I have no alibi.<br> Lester! I was with you yesterday! Lester!<br> - I was with you yesterday, right, Lester?<br> - Right. And now I'm with Ms Gladstone.<br> I left the club at one.<br> I couldn't have done it!<br> That's right. You couldn't have done it.<br> Close the door on your way out.<br> I couldn't have gone to Hawaii and back<br> in that time. So what am I worried about?<br> That's what I'd like to know. Hawaii<br> and back? No way, man. You're cool.<br> Well... Now, if he left the club at one,<br> he could catch the three o'clock flight.<br> You could be in Hawaii by five,<br> given the three-hour time change.<br> - She's got a point.<br> - You could spend four hours there...<br> . . and still catch the last flight out by ten.<br> - That's true.<br> - You'd arrive at LAX by 6am.<br> An hour on the freeway...<br> You'd be home by seven.<br> Whatever it is, you're fuckin' guilty, man.<br> Meet Senior Flight Supervisor Gladstone.<br> Hi. Pleased to meet you. Listen,<br> I've got a flight schedule in here.<br> - I was on a rock!<br> - A rock?<br> They're gonna think I did it!<br> I'm all motive and no alibi!<br> I have no alibi! Motives are no problem.<br> I'm up to my ass in motives.<br> I'm majoring in motives.<br> Alibi, nowhere near my neighbourhood.<br> But motives: whooo-ooh!<br> - I gotta go! Can I borrow your car?<br> - Sure, man. The keys are on the table...<br> . . next to the door. Goodbye.<br> I gotta find Beth.<br> What am I doing?<br> What the hell am I doing?!<br> She's not dead.<br> I'm crazy. I'm a crazy man.<br> She is not dead. He didn't kill her.<br> News from Hawaii: Novelist Margaret<br> Donner is missing and presumed dead.<br> - According to the police...<br> - Holy Christ!<br> I'm not crazy! She's presumed!<br> She was last seen boarding a boat<br> to Maui. She disappeared along route.<br> - A search is on for the body.<br> - Margaret is dead! Poor Margaret!<br> She is the renowned author<br> of the best-selling novel "Hot Fire".<br> That slut! She is a slut! Slut!<br> Foul play has not been ruled out.<br> I'm gonna fry!<br> I'm in really deep shit, Beth.<br> Ah. Look who's decided<br> to breeze back into my life.<br> - I gotta talk to you.<br> - You have to talk to me?<br> You don't return my calls or get in touch.<br> But hey, you need something from me?<br> Make yourself at home. Have a seat.<br> Can I offer you something? A cool drink?<br> Would you listen to me?<br> I'm in a lot of trouble!<br> - I'm on the edge of my seat.<br> - It's Margaret.<br> Don't tell me! She's come back.<br> - She's...<br> - Pregnant, put on weight...<br> She's dead!<br> Oh, God.<br> - It's awful.<br> - Larry, I'm sorry.<br> - Did she suffer?<br> - He said she didn't feel a thing.<br> - Her doctor?<br> - Her killer.<br> - She was killed?!<br> - She's dead. It works that way.<br> Wait! Did the police find a clue<br> or have a motive or...<br> If there was a motive, the fat little bastard<br> never would've killed her! Don't you see?<br> Eliminate the motive, establish an alibi.<br> - Just like I told him!<br> - Just like you told him?!<br> - We were speaking hypothetically.<br> - Larry Donner! Did...<br> - Did you pay a man to kill your wife?<br> - No! He just did it.<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - Hey, look. I told a guy something...<br> . . and he took it the wrong way.<br> What, uh... What did you say to him?<br> - "Don't kill my wife", wink, wink?<br> - I don't like your tone.<br> - Oh, God. You better leave.<br> - I got noplace else to go.<br> - My head is spinning.<br> - Oh, and my head isn't creamed corn?<br> You announced that you may or may not<br> have inadvertently murdered someone.<br> Mm-hm.<br> This puts me in a highly distracted<br> state of mind. I am nauseous.<br> Great! Margaret is dead, I have no alibi,<br> and you're mad that I upset your stomach.<br> Well, excuse me. I'll just go<br> so the police can start their manhunt!<br> One little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper!<br> Jeez, you think you know somebody.<br> Cahuenga Pass.<br> Leave a snappy message. Bye.<br> Larry, it's Beth. Um...<br> Call me at home right now, OK?<br> As soon as you get in. I'm very confused.<br> You... came in with just...<br> murder and Margaret, and I just...<br> Call me... now. Thank you.<br> - Larry!<br> - Get in the car, Owen.<br> - This isn't your car.<br> - I borrowed it. Get in!<br> I thought you might like to have this.<br> It belonged to Margaret.<br> Get in the car. Get in the car!<br> Look what you did. You killed my wife!<br> No, I didn't. Yes, I did.<br> You're sick, Owen. You need care.<br> I am taking you to the police.<br> Did you know Hawaii<br> was a series of islands...<br> . . that was all spit up by the same<br> volcano? I never knew that.<br> You killed somebody!<br> You're a murderer! You took a life!<br> You're right. I'm no good.<br> How could I do that? I'm a sick, sick per...<br> Cows!<br> - Why did you kill my wife?!<br> - I thought you wanted me to.<br> You said you wished she was dead.<br> I told you I wished my momma was dead.<br> I kill your wife, you kill my momma.<br> That's fair.<br> I am not killing your mother.<br> - You have to turn yourself in.<br> - No. It was part of our plan.<br> What plan?!<br> There was no plan, you moron!<br> You killed a person and<br> I'm takin' you to the police!<br> I'll just tell 'em that you did it.<br> You got the motive.<br> - You're gonna tell them the truth.<br> - Huh?<br> You're gonna tell the police the truth<br> or I'll kill us both, I swear!<br> - I didn't do this only for me.<br> - Say goodbye, Owen.<br> Larry... Larry, slow down.<br> You're goin' a tad fast.<br> Please slow down, Larry!<br> I don't like goin' fast!<br> - Are you gonna tell 'em you did it?<br> - Please slow down!<br> Huh?<br> - Yeah. I'll do it.<br> - OK.<br> - Please stop the car!<br> - I can't!<br> - Stop the car!<br> - There's no brakes!<br> - What?! Watch out for that car!<br> -<br> - Oh. You're a good driver, Larry.<br> - Just shut up!<br> Larry! Larry!<br> Larry, you're originally<br> from the East, aren't you?<br> - Owen!<br> - A man on our block was from the East.<br> Mr Brockman.<br> He was in the button business.<br> - Is that right?<br> - Yeah. This is good!<br> It's like the Flintstones car wash.<br> Larry! Ooh, I can't look!<br> Whoa!<br> So are you telling me<br> you weren't driving that car?<br> Look, man. It's like I told you.<br> He borrowed the car yesterday morning<br> and I haven't seen him since.<br> - Did he say where he was going?<br> - No. Mumbled about motives and alibis.<br> Motives and alibis?<br> He figured that since Margaret ruined his<br> life, you'd think he killed her or somethin'.<br> - You don't think he did?<br> - No, I don't think so.<br> Personally, if the bitch stole my book,<br> I'd kill her. But that's me.<br> Larry? There's no way he coulda done it.<br> What makes you say that?<br> Because Larry never did...<br> . . anything.<br> OK. Here we go. Eggs a la Owen.<br> Owen, get it<br> through your thick head.<br> I may be a lot of things,<br> but I am not a killer.<br> You don't have to blow her brains out.<br> Thank you! That takes<br> the pressure right off<br> She's old. She's got a bad ticker.<br> All you gotta do is<br> jerk around a lot when you talk to her.<br> - "Nice to meet you, Mrs Lift!"<br> - Would you stop it?<br> Well, just meet her. Maybe she'd be<br> somebody you'd like to kill.<br> Owen! What the hell's<br> going on out there?!<br> Nothing, Momma!<br> - We woke her up.<br> - Who are you talking to? Who's in there?<br> - Nobody, Momma!<br> -<br> Who's this?<br> This is Cousin Paddy.<br> He's gonna be stayin' with us for a while.<br> Isn't that nice?<br> You don't have a Cousin Paddy!<br> You lied to me!<br> - That's it. That's all.<br> - Larry... Larry.<br> I'm sorry. She makes me so nervous.<br> Come on. Go in there and sit down.<br> I'll get you some ice.<br> So what do you think of her?<br> I think she could relax a little bit.<br> - Are you gonna do it?<br> - Owen...<br> I'm not gonna kill your mother.<br> If you wanna do it, you do it.<br> A guy kills my wife.<br> He can't even kill his own mother.<br> - You wanna see my coin collection?<br> - No!<br> I collect coins.<br> - I got a dandy collection.<br> - I don't wanna see it, Owen.<br> - But it's my collection.<br> - I don't care.<br> Look, Owen. I'm just not in the mood. OK?<br> Never showed it to anyone before.<br> - All right, I'll look at it.<br> - No, it's OK.<br> - Show it to me.<br> - No, you don't mean it.<br> - Show me the damn coins!<br> - All right.<br> This one is a nickel.<br> This one also is a nickel.<br> And here's a quarter.<br> And another quarter.<br> And a penny.<br> See? Nickel, nickel,<br> quarter, quarter, penny.<br> Are any of these coins worth anything?<br> No.<br> And here... is another nickel.<br> - Why do you have them?<br> - What do you mean?<br> The purpose of a coin collection is that<br> the coins are worth something, Owen.<br> Oh, but they are.<br> This one here I got in change...<br> . . when my dad took me<br> to see Peter, Paul and Mary.<br> And this one I got in change<br> when I bought a hot dog at the circus.<br> My daddy let me keep the change.<br> He always let me keep the change.<br> This one...<br> . . is my favourite.<br> This is Martin and Lewis<br> at the Hollywood Palladium.<br> Look at that.<br> See the way it shines on the little eagle?<br> I loved my dad a lot.<br> - So this whole collection is...<br> - Change my daddy let me keep.<br> - What was his name?<br> - Ned.<br> He used to call me his little Ned.<br> That's why Momma named me Owen.<br> I really miss him.<br> - It's a real nice collection, Owen.<br> - Thank you, Larry.<br> - Owen! Food!<br> - In a minute, Momma!<br> Don't you "in a minute" me! Get off<br> your fat little ass or I'll break it for you!<br> I want two soft-boiled eggs, white toast<br> and some of that grape jelly, goddammit!<br> And don't burn the toast!<br> - Kill her, Larry.<br> - I can't.<br> You gotta kill her for me, Larry.<br> Don't you understand? Crisscross.<br> Crisscross! You gotta do it, Larry!<br> If you don't, I will. I swear I will.<br> Move it, fat boy!<br> - That's it! I'm gonna choke her to death!<br> - No, Owen!<br> I swear to God, I'm gonna kill her!<br> - Calm down, Owen.<br> - Larry...<br> It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK, Owen.<br> I promise.<br> Will you do it?<br> Yeah. I'll do it.<br> Larry, you're the best pal a guy ever had.<br> Here. Look. I want you to have this.<br> Look. Here. It's a souvenir from<br> the London Bridge gift shop in Arizona.<br> Look. See? They brought this bridge over<br> from London, England, stone by stone.<br> See the little bridge?<br> See the stones there?<br> - Yeah, I see 'em.<br> - Here. You can have that.<br> Crisscross.<br> - When did you last see him?<br> - I can't remember. I told you.<br> - The day after his wife disappeared?<br> - I didn't say that.<br> - Miss Ryan, why are you protecting him?<br> - I'm not. I just don't think he killed her.<br> Where do you think he is, Miss Ryan?<br> I don't know!<br> - He's in a lot of trouble.<br> - He didn't do it.<br> Then who do you suppose did?<br> - Somebody else.<br> - So you do think it was murder.<br> - You know who killed her, don't you?<br> - No.<br> - Yes, you do.<br> - I do not! He wouldn't tell me!<br> Did Professor Donner<br> hire a man to kill his wife?<br> No! He said... not really.<br> And I heard him scream out<br> "l hate her! I wish she were dead!"<br> Yeah, I heard him. He said<br> "l hate her. I wish she was dead. "<br> That's what he said.<br> "l hate her. I wish she was dead. "<br> He called her a very bad name...<br> . . and screamed "l hate her.<br> I wish she were dead. "<br> It's a coffee-table book.<br> All right, Momma.<br> Turn off the TV.<br> OK.<br> Goodbye, Momma.<br> - She'll be sleepin' in a couple of minutes.<br> - I graduated from Yale.<br> All right. Out you go.<br> - Out? Out where?<br> - Out on the ledge. Go out on the roof...<br> - No, no. I'm not going out on any ledge.<br> - You gotta make it look like a burglar.<br> - You go in, you mess up things...<br> - No, Owen. This is going too far.<br> - You want outta this?<br> - Yes.<br> Then fulfil your end of the bargain. You go<br> in, stuff a pillow over her face and leave.<br> You walk out that door.<br> You never have to see me again, OK?<br> Oh, God!<br> - OK. Out you go.<br> - Shit. I hate heights.<br> Larry!<br> - You all right? Move your hand.<br> - Why?<br> Gotta close the window.<br> And like this you kill an evening.<br> Rats! Now I got Willard here.<br> I'm bein' held captive by a little troll who<br> should be hanging off a rear-view mirror.<br> I'm not doin' this.<br> - Aargh!<br> - What are you doin'?<br> I'm selling The Watchtower!<br> What do you think?!<br> You got rats the size of Oldsmobiles here!<br> Rats.<br> OK, forget about the burglar stuff.<br> Just go through her door.<br> It's less dramatic but I don't wanna<br> make you uncomfortable. Here, use this.<br> - I really don't like you, Owen.<br> - OK, I gotta go.<br> If I'm late for my lane,<br> they tack on an extra buck.<br> Ugh. What a week.<br> Mrs Lift, I know you don't want to hear<br> anything derogatory about your son.<br> I understand that. Because he's not a bad<br> man, Mrs Lift. He's a nice man, actually.<br> He is a lunatic. No, Mrs Lift, he is.<br> He's a lunatic. And, um...<br> I don't have to be here now, Mrs Lift.<br> I could be in Mexico, out of all of this.<br> I'm only here to stop him fr...<br> How do you say this, Mrs Lift?<br> Listen to me, Mrs Lift.<br> Your son... killed my wife.<br> And now he wants me to kill you.<br> - Mrs Lift?<br> -<br> - I'm gonna go read the paper now and...<br> -<br> I'm just glad we had this chance to talk.<br> I'm a fugitive. The little bastard<br> turned me into Richard Kimble.<br> He shit and shoved me in it.<br> I gotta get outta here! I gotta go!<br> Where am I running? Evidence.<br> Incriminating evidence!<br> Nothing.<br> Ha! A lei.<br> Poha jelly.<br> Not enough!<br> Poha jelly, a lei and a doll.<br> I need some evidence.<br> Aha! Bingo. The mother lode.<br> A plane ticket!<br> A little careless, Owen, aren't we?<br> Los Angeles, Hawaii, 10am!<br> I got you! A plane ticket!<br> With my name on it.<br> Oh, God!<br> Cops!<br> Mr Lift?<br> We'd like to ask you a few questions.<br> I hope there's no trouble.<br> I was at the bowlin' alley all night.<br> I hope there's nothin' wrong.<br> No, we'd like to ask you<br> about Professor Donner.<br> - Professor Donner?<br> - Yes. Would you mind if we came in?<br> - In the house?<br> - Just a few questions.<br> I... I'm sorry. You can't.<br> My momma's real sick.<br> I don't think it's a good idea.<br> - lt'll only take a minute.<br> - No, l...<br> OK! All right. Come on up.<br> If it'll only take a minute,<br> that won't be so bad.<br> Would you like to meet my momma?<br> We understand you take Professor<br> Donner's course at Valley College.<br> Yeah. Creative writing.<br> I'm gonna put my bowlin' ball away.<br> - I'm his star pupil.<br> - Do you have any idea where he is?<br> Did you try his apartment? He goes there<br> a lot. He keeps his stuff there.<br> You guys wanna have some tea?<br> We've got orange pekoe, ...<br> . . we've got lrish breakfast, ...<br> . . we've got Darjeeling...<br> Mr Lift, have you ever heard<br> Professor Donner talk about his wife?<br> Professor Donner? Oh, he... he always<br> talked about her like she was an angel.<br> He loved his wife.<br> He worshipped the ground she... Hi.<br> Hi, tea! Hi, tea. Hi.<br> You never heard him say<br> anything bad about her?<br> Oh. This is lrish breakfast.<br> I'll get Darjeeling.<br> Whatever you want, Mr Lift.<br> We won't be havin' any.<br> - What was that question again?<br> - Owen!<br> Momma! You're alive!<br> Old people - you have to reassure them.<br> Mr Lift, can we get back<br> to Professor Donner?<br> Yes. By all means, let's get back to him.<br> - Mr Lift...<br> - Oh! You know what?<br> This... This box is empty.<br> Could you get me some tea in the pantry?<br> Sure. No problem.<br> You said that he loved his wife.<br> What gave you that idea?<br> Oh! I'm sorry, officer.<br> I have some tea right here on the stove.<br> It won't be necessary.<br> - Oh. No problem.<br> - What was that question again?<br> What makes you think<br> that he loved his wife?<br> But you know what you could get me<br> is some sugar.<br> Is it in the pantry?<br> - Yeah.<br> - No problem.<br> I shouldn't use sugar in my tea because<br> I'm carryin' around this spare tyre.<br> I'd like to get rid of it<br> but it's so hard to cut back.<br> - Owen! You did it, didn't you, Owen?<br> - No, Momma, I didn't.<br> - Yes, you did!<br> - No! Honest to God, I didn't do it!<br> You told them to take me away!<br> Oh. No, Momma.
