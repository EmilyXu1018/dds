That was very good.<br> Where are we headed, man? I'm ready.<br> I don't know.<br> Sometimes when there's nothin' to do,<br> it's best just to keep movin'.<br> You smell somethin' up here?<br> No.<br> Smell that?<br> I don't smell anything.<br> It smells like shit.<br> Ah...<br> - Raccoon shit.<br> - Raccoon shit.<br> Hang your hand<br> out the window and let the rain get at it.<br> - Would you like a little on your...<br> - No, get outta here!<br> Just remember not to pick your teeth.<br> Oh, God.<br> Now, in these small-town banks,<br> they leave the telephone<br> off the hook in the vault at night<br> so the local operator can listen in.<br> People walk into these banks today<br> with paper sacks,<br> fill 'em full of money and they walk out.<br> You see that all the time.<br> Anybody can do it.<br> Bullshit.<br> Now, the newest bank vaults<br> have walls of reinforced concrete<br> five feet thick,<br> backed by six inches of steel.<br> The vault door is stainless steel-faced.<br> It's an inch and a half of cast steel,<br> another 12 inches of burn-resisting steel,<br> and another inch<br> and a half of open-hearthed steel.<br> Come here.<br> A vault door has 20 bolts,<br> each an inch in diameter.<br> Eight on each side, eight on the other,<br> two top and two bottom.<br> This holds the door into a 16-inch steel jamb<br> set in 18 inches of concrete<br> which is crosshatched by steel bars<br> running both vertical and horizontal.<br> Now, this door is precision-made<br> so you can't pour nitro in between<br> the seam of the door and the vault.<br> Yeah.<br> If that isn't enough,<br> there's microphones, electric eyes,<br> pressure-sensitive mats,<br> vibration detectors, tear gas,<br> and even thermostats that detect<br> the slightest rise in temperature.<br> You still interested in banks, kid?<br> - I knew you weren't a preacher.<br> - Shit.<br> Preaching isn't so bad. You get used to it.<br> Uh, you are what you do, so to speak.<br> At times I even forgot about the money.<br> What money?<br> Montana Armored.<br> Montana Armored?<br> How did you get into the vault?<br> with armor-piercing shells.<br> Wasn't too hard.<br> Hey, that was on the news.<br> That was a big deal.<br> What did they call that guy?<br> The Thunderbolt.<br> That's you.<br> You're the Thunderbolt.<br> Mmm-hmm, parson's luck.<br> Oh, no!<br> Watch out for the dog shit.<br> Thunderbolt!<br> Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.<br> That sounds like something, doesn't it?<br> You're forgetting<br> I'm a hell of a lot older than you are kid.<br> Hey, there are plenty of guys twice my age<br> who don't know their ass<br> from a hole in the ground.<br> I won't fault you there.<br> In for a penny, in for a pound.<br> So, who are these guys<br> that are following us?<br> Oh...<br> The big dude's a war hero.<br> His name's Red Leary.<br> Saved my life once in Korea.<br> He was sent to prison in Illinois later on<br> for stabbing a woman.<br> There he met<br> an old-time bank robber, named Billy Lamb.<br> Lamb taught him how to break safes.<br> Lamb was a real genius for organization.<br> Thanks.<br> When they got out,<br> Lamb introduced him to Dunlop,<br> Dunlop's an electronics expert or was.<br> That's the guy you took care of in the field.<br> - Wanna brew?<br> - Definitely.<br> The little Orphan Annie-eyed<br> character's Eddie Goody.<br> He's a driver.<br> He's harmless when he's alone.<br> So, what happened to the money?<br> Hey, I don't care anything about the money,<br> you know that.<br> We're friends, right? I like you as a friend.<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, we hid it in a one-room<br> schoolhouse in Warsaw, Montana.<br> A place Lamb went to when he was a kid.<br> Hid it in the wall<br> right behind the blackboard.<br> Half a million dollars-worth. It's still there.<br> Schoolhouse?<br> Right behind the blackboard.<br> Why?<br> Well, it was always<br> Lamb's practice to control the money<br> till the final split.<br> We kept in contact with each other<br> through personals in the newspaper.<br> Then Lamb had a heart attack and died.<br> Guess he was just too old for it.<br> Leary got suspicious<br> but I wasn't about to tell him<br> where the hell the money was,<br> because I knew he'd go straight to it,<br> heat or no heat.<br> Well, then the police<br> released a thing in the press<br> saying that the money had been found.<br> Bullshit.<br> Leary went off his ass.<br> He got careless<br> but he couldn't lead them to the money<br> 'cause he didn't know where the hell it was.<br> Finally, they arrested<br> and convicted him on another bank robbery<br> that took place several years before.<br> And when he got out<br> he convinced the others I'd set him up.<br> I decided best that I should drop out<br> for a while.<br> That church was a pretty far-out idea.<br> Hmm.<br> About as far out as possible, I thought.<br> Fuck!<br> Are you sure this is the spot?<br> Yeah.<br> What? I didn't hear what you said.<br> I said, yeah, this is it.<br> Well, what happened to it?<br> I don't know. Progress.<br> Have a nice day, boy.<br> Here, for you.<br> That's the last of our money.<br> It's good.<br> Real good.<br> Fantastic pistachio.<br> What do we do now?<br> Drop your cocks and reach for your socks.<br> Don't look at me. I didn't say a word.<br> - Red?<br> - Start the car.<br> Freeze, you son of a bitch.<br> The first one of you moves I shoot.<br> All right, kill the engine.<br> Hand me the keys and don't turn around.<br> Now, both of you get out of Pistachio's side.<br> No ideas, you'll both<br> be dead before you hit the ground.<br> Move it.<br> Turn around.<br> The guy's in the car.<br> That's it, smartass.<br> Red. Goody.<br> How's Dunlop?<br> That's for us to know and you to find out.<br> Shut up, Goody.<br> Well, what do you want, Red?<br> What do I want?<br> You got balls. I'll say that for you, Johnny.<br> I want your ass, that's what I want,<br> my friend.<br> Hey, flattery's<br> not gonna get you guys anywhere.<br> Who's the comedian?<br> Name's Lightfoot.<br> Does he know everything?<br> - No.<br> - Yeah.<br> Lightfoot, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> It's a good thing I didn't hit him in the face.<br> He'd be dead now.<br> You always had<br> a high opinion of yourself, Red.<br> What have you been preaching lately,<br> Johnny?<br> Survival.<br> - Are you ready?<br> - I've been counting the days.<br> That's for the kid.<br> Now, do you wanna talk<br> or you wanna play games?<br> What do you want me to do, Red?<br> Shut your face.<br> I can't breathe! I got asthma.<br> What do you want me to do now, Red?<br> Kill the son of a bitch.<br> Here?<br> Yes.<br> Now?<br> Now!<br> Don't ever point a gun at me. Understand?<br> Not even a twig.<br> You got it.<br> You come from the hitters, don't you?<br> What are you waiting for?<br> Why don't you kill me? I would've killed you.<br> That doesn't make up<br> for a difference in two years.<br> I'm gonna kill you anyway.<br> The money was here, in the schoolhouse.<br> What's this garbage talking about?<br> The money was never recovered.<br> The TV, and the radio,<br> the papers, everybody was lying.<br> They were working with the police.<br> When Lamb died I...<br> I never came back here.<br> The money's still here. It's safe.<br> Here?<br> Yeah. Lamb went to school here in Warsaw,<br> a little one-room schoolhouse.<br> We put the money in the wall,<br> behind the blackboard.<br> Where's this one-room schoolhouse?<br> Gone.<br> Gone? Gone where?<br> I wish I knew.<br> Used to be<br> right where the new schoolhouse is now.<br> You expect me to believe all this crap?<br> It's the sad-ass truth, Red.<br> Why do you think<br> I'd come to a dumb town like this?<br> How the hell do I know?<br> You're queer for dumb towns.<br> Half a million dollars<br> just don't disappear like that.<br> They should've found<br> something when they tore the place down.<br> I wish I had the answer for you.<br> The sad part is that we got away with it.<br> It's a sin, that's what it is.<br> Christ, it's a sin.<br> Oh.<br> Boy, I feel old.<br> What are we gonna do now, Red?<br> Shut up, Goody.<br> I got hay fever too.<br> Why not do it again?<br> What's he mouthing off about now?<br> Montana Armored.<br> We hit the same place, the same way.<br> - Montana Armored?<br> - Yeah?<br> What?<br> Hey, they'd never expect it.<br> Not something that big.<br> It's never been done before, has it?<br> Oh, that'd really be something, wouldn't it?<br> Yeah, it sure would.<br> Hey, I think that's a great idea.<br> Let's not get queer about a crackpot idea.<br> What the hell does the kid know, anyway?<br> Besides the Lamb is dead<br> and he wrecked Dunlop.<br> You don't need the Lamb anymore.<br> We do it exactly the same way.<br> You already did it once.<br> You might have something there.<br> The blind leading the blind. He's a kid.<br> He eats pistachio ice cream.<br> Jesus, you can lead a mule to water,<br> but you can't make him drink it.<br> That's a horse, not a mule. It's a horse.<br> I agree.<br> - Agree with what?<br> - With him.<br> Good grief.<br> Even if I did agree, which I don't,<br> what would we use<br> as a stake to operate with?<br> Well, we could all get jobs for a while.<br> Goody, you're better at asking questions<br> than you are at answering them.<br> And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb<br> and the leopard shall lie down with the kid.<br> What's that? A poem?<br> No, it's a prayer.<br> Better than letting that piece of junk<br> run out on the highway.<br> We got Goody's car still.<br> The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.<br> Where the hell<br> do you pick up these pearls of wisdom?<br> Books.<br> You mean you can actually read?<br> I read you loud and clear.<br> You better believe it.<br> All right, that's enough.<br> We got to keep it together now.<br> If you guys can't manage that, then I walk.<br> I'd like to hit him again just for the hell of it.<br> Well, there it is.<br> That's it?<br> Sure doesn't look like much, does it?<br> Doesn't look like much?<br> You dopey son of a bitch.<br> Goody, help me out...<br> Simple-minded son of a bitch.<br> What did you get in my way for?<br> Love this guy.<br> We're gonna be<br> great friends, Red.<br> You forgot to give me<br> your Social Security number.<br> What?<br> I said that you forgot to give me<br> your Social Security number.<br> I've forgotten it.<br> Forgotten it?<br> Come on, nobody ever forgets their number.<br> Where you been working?<br> Uh, listen, I'm gonna need it for these.<br> So, if you can bring it to me tomorrow<br> I'd appreciate it.<br> Thanks. Hey.<br> Do you live near?<br> Man, I'm going crazy.<br> That drives me wild.<br> She just does something to me.<br> Why did you leave like that?<br> I couldn't wear that stuff. Too humiliating.<br> And you look ridiculous.<br> What's this?<br> That's my route.<br> Just follow the streets<br> and it takes you right back to the garage.<br> If you don't mind my saying,<br> I think you should get a job.<br> - Nobody asked you.<br> - All right, all right.<br> Read me the first street.<br> Left on 12th Avenue South to 9th Street,<br> right on North 3rd to the viaduct...<br> One at a time!<br> Left on 12th Avenue South.<br> You boys are being paid<br> by the hour!<br> Whoo!<br> We haven't got all day on this mother.<br> Got to move it.<br> Baby, baby<br> Baby, down baby<br> Baby, baby<br> There's a kid now. Pull over.<br> It's my truck. I know what to do.<br> You're on the wrong street.<br> What?<br> I said you're on the wrong street.<br> - What's he talking about?<br> - By me.<br> You're too early.<br> You're supposed<br> to go down the next street first,<br> and then come up this street.<br> Well, listen.<br> While we're here, can I sell you anything?<br> No, I'm waiting for Judy Ann.<br> They have a better flavor of pistachio.<br> Look, kid, go fuck a duck.<br> Here comes, uh,<br> Lightfoot.<br> He's late, as usual.<br> Hey, the woman<br> came to the window again today.<br> Stark-naked this time.<br> Stark-naked?<br> No kidding?<br> What did she do?<br> Just stood there and stared at me.<br> How close was you?<br> As close as I am to you right now.<br> Did you see everything?<br> What do you mean, everything?<br> You know what I mean, everything.<br> Clear as day.<br> What did you do about it, big mouth?<br> I'll kill you for that!<br> Sit down, Red. Sit down!<br> Young kids,<br> they don't believe in anything anymore.<br> You'll get yours when this is over.<br> One way or another.<br> You can believe in that.<br> All maintenance<br> personnel off the floor.<br> Bringing in the guard dogs now.<br> To hell with them damn dogs.<br> They treat them better than they treat us.<br> Every night,<br> they rush us out of here like animals.<br> Let's not argue now, Sam.<br> Those dogs ate up a man here once.<br> - Ate him?<br> - Yeah.<br> Wrong man came on duty, dogs ate him up.<br> They'll go through<br> a plate-glass window to get at you.<br> Now, a man just don't fool around<br> with those kind of animals.<br> Hey, man. Play it cool.<br> What did you think about that shot?<br> You know, the double rail.<br> Three-ball in the corner pocket?<br> Pretty honky I'll tell you.<br> I thought it was a pretty good shot.<br> There wasn't anything wrong with it.<br> Wasn't the best shot, but it's all right.<br> - Who's that guy?<br> - Oh, he's a new guy.<br> He won't even come outside anymore.<br> Matter of fact, when he gets to work,<br> he keeps that door locked tight.<br> Why's that?<br> Well, one time we got him out<br> here on the sidewalk, you know.<br> And I kind of got up close to him<br> and unzipped my pants<br> and took out my pecker.<br> And I put that dude right in his hand.<br> He turned white.<br> He didn't know whether to hold it or drop it<br> or run off down the street with it.<br> It was the funniest thing<br> I ever saw in my life.<br> We just all rolled<br> up out of here on the sidewalk<br> splitting our guts. It was really funny.<br> Hey, Mario.<br> Hey, boss, it's raining.<br> Work between the drops.<br> Hey, Mario, what do we do about the rain?<br> Take your lunch hour now.<br> Lunch? It's 9:00 in the morning.<br> Shit! Son of a bitch.<br> My own brother-in-law.<br> Got every skirt<br> in the neighborhood chasing after him.<br> You'd think<br> he'd share one with me just once.<br> Just once, it never happened.<br> Stick out your tongue.<br> I'll teach you how to lick your eyebrows.<br> You'll have every woman on the block<br> hangin' off your ass.<br> Hey, can I borrow the truck?<br> - What for?<br> - Doctor.<br> You got a dose?<br> Full disaster, man.<br> Yeah, go ahead. We're on our lunch hour.<br> What the hell.<br> Just don't wrap it up. It's my ass if you do.<br> Hey, don't worry. I'll be back in an hour.<br> - I'm just gonna go upstairs and clean up.<br> - All right.<br> Hey, where'd you get those pants?<br> You freak!<br> I love you! Come back!<br> Where'd you get the dents?<br> Progress.<br> Hey, Leary,<br> I had a dream about you last night.<br> What about?<br> I dreamt you said hello to me.<br> Now, don't you go getting<br> smart again with me, Lightfoot.<br> I'll break both your arms.<br> Oh, well, I'll keep that in mind.<br> You just remember what I said.<br> John and me go back a long way together.<br> Before Korea even.<br> But you don't mean nothing<br> to me, you understand? Nothing!<br> What'd you try and kill him for then?<br> Because we were friends.<br> Thank you.<br> You boys are new around here. Aren't you?<br> Yeah.<br> Here's your receipt.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> You're gonna need some help with that box?<br> Ah, no thanks. We can manage by ourselves.<br> Thank you.<br> Okay. Suit yourself.<br> Relax. Relax.<br> One tank to a pop.<br> Johnny got four of them in Korea.<br> They gave him a Silver Star. He was a hero.<br> - Hero?<br> - That son of a bitch even saved my life once.<br> Come on.<br> This isn't gonna work.<br> I wish Dunlop was still here.<br> How did you<br> take care of the alarm last time?<br> Dunlop monitored<br> the frequency of the signal on the wire.<br> He duplicated it<br> and then ran it back into the circuit<br> with a spring-loaded snap switch.<br> The whole deal fit into two lunchboxes.<br> We don't have Dunlop now, do we?<br> Yeah, you took care of that.<br> Trouble with these new alarm systems,<br> they buzz directly<br> into the branch manager's bedroom<br> and the telegraph office.<br> Now, this lulls whoever<br> is busting into the vault<br> into a false sense of security,<br> because he doesn't hear an alarm go off.<br> Yeah, It's still a hard-wire system,<br> runs right through the telegraph lines.<br> There's no antenna there, I'm sure of that.<br> We just got to make sure<br> that the alarm isn't reported.<br> Now, the big risk, of course being is<br> if they've run a hard wire<br> into someplace else, like the Sheriff's office.<br> How far away is that?<br> I clocked that on the truck<br> doing 40 miles per hour.<br> Now, if the police come down on us hard,<br> say, at an average of 80 miles an hour,<br> I figure we're seven minutes on the inside,<br> depending on which route they take.<br> However, I think to be absolutely sure<br> that we should use<br> five minutes as our bottom line<br> from the time you trip<br> the alarm inside the vault.<br> Unless a patrol car<br> happens to be cruising closer.<br> All right. Five minutes it is.<br> Now, Leary and I<br> will take care of the manager's house.<br> It's Sunday so the bars will be closed.<br> The only place open<br> will be the telegraph office.<br> At exactly 10:30,<br> Goody, you're gonna drop Lightfoot off<br> in the alley behind the Liberty Lounge.<br> The window's already been fixed<br> so you can climb right in<br> and change your clothes.<br> You stay there until 11:30.<br> Don't fool around the bar or anything.<br> You stay right there until 11:30, in the can.<br> Understand?<br> At 11:30, you climb out of there<br> and you get into the telegraph office.<br> You got to get in there before 11:35,<br> because that's when the alarm goes off.<br> Now, you'll see a light<br> light up on the console.<br> When that lights up,<br> that means Leary and I are in the vault.<br> And we don't care how you get inside.<br> Look, I don't know if I can pull this thing off.<br> How am I supposed to know what to do?<br> What's the matter?<br> Is the job too tough for you?<br> You know, you can't<br> stop this thing once you start.<br> Billy the Kid.<br> All right,<br> this isn't a game, you know.<br> You got to get that fat guy<br> before he reports the alarm.<br> You tie him up,<br> gag him and put him in the can.<br> People are used to him<br> being in the can for long periods of time.<br> And you leave the place neat. Understand?<br> Just like you found it.<br> Now, at 11:36 Goody comes around back.<br> If you're not ready to go,<br> he goes without you.<br> You get in the car and you hit the floor.<br> You stay there, you don't talk.<br> You don't make any noise.<br> You don't move around till Goody tells you.<br> At 11:39 Goody comes back to the vault.<br> Leary and I will be there with the money.<br> If we're not, you just keep right on going.<br> If we pull this whole thing off,<br> we should be able to make<br> the midnight movie at the drive-in.<br> Then what?<br> We watch the show.<br> Then in the morning we split the money up<br> and go our separate ways.<br> Here's a watch.<br> You're gonna need a watch now.<br> Hey, Billy. Don't forget to shave.<br> Tweet tweet.<br> ...will Charlie Johnson,<br> please, in the blue Chevy,<br> license plate 74. Is he here?<br> Three guys in the back, "Huh?"<br> I'm not gonna say it again, lady.<br> I'm warning you now.<br> How do you see yourself?<br> Nude, usually.<br> Tell me, if you were<br> the producer of the show,<br> how would you produce Don Rickles?<br> Trying to be pretty much what I am.<br> I mean doing what I do on the stage.<br> There's certain words that you use,<br> that I don't find offensive,<br> but you can't use it on television.<br> Keep quiet and nobody gets hurt.<br> Wake him up. Wake him up.<br> Jack. Jack!<br> What the hell's the matter with you?<br> Oh, no. Not again.<br> You just keep quiet and nobody gets hurt.<br> Understand?<br> Oh, my God! My child. Please!<br> She's just a baby.<br> Okay, but just keep it down.<br> I don't want my mother to hear me.<br> Oh, my God!<br> I was just getting started.<br> All right! I want the combination<br> of the outer guard doors.<br> Left series first.<br> Come on.<br> Uh, L-2,<br> R-3, R-7.<br> Uh, L-2, R-3,<br> R-5, R-7.<br> Again. Faster.<br> Uh, L-2, R-3, R-7,<br> L-2, R-3, R-5, R-7.<br> All right. One more time. Now really fast.<br> L-2, R-3, R-7,<br> L-2, R-3, R-5,<br> R-7.<br> All right. Now backwards. Quick.<br> Come on!<br> You're confusing me.<br> Say it fast<br> or you'll never say anything again.<br> R...<br> No, R-3, L-2,<br> Uh, R-7, L-2, R-3, R-5, R-7.<br> What a way to go.<br> It's 11: 15.<br> You ready?<br> Right.<br> Murph, shake your ass up.<br> Come on, you son of a bitch.<br> Oh, you sexy bitch.<br> I'd even go out with you myself.<br> Oh! Shit!<br> When this is over, I'm gonna get that kid.<br> You'll have to come by me first.<br> Hi. Come on in.<br> Hi.<br> Fill it up with high-test.<br> Where the hell is he, anyway?<br> That's five.<br> Goody!<br> Get some more.<br> No, let's go. Come on.<br> Hello, Red.<br> You did a good job.<br> Thanks. Oh, here's your watch back.<br> Keep it.<br> - You all right?<br> - Yeah, I'm okay.<br> But after all that running around,<br> I gotta go so bad I can't see straight.<br> I got weak kidneys.<br> Shut your mouth or you'll drown both of us.<br> All right, keep quiet back there now.<br> If you gotta go, you gotta go.<br> Yes, sure.<br> Do you think she heard that?<br> I can't help it. I'm dyin' back here.<br> Red-haired women are bad luck.<br> What's wrong?<br> Just stay calm, Red. So far, so good.<br> Yeah, it's good. Full of vitamin hay.<br> Try some.<br> Ow!<br> What do you think?<br> Is that the heat?<br> Here.<br> That's seven minutes the inside.<br> Nice work, Goody.<br> Seems there was another hook-up after all.<br> You mean everything I did was for nothing?<br> Seems that way, doesn't it?<br> Oh, Christ!<br> Come on, keep your lid on now, Louise.<br> Goddamn! Hello, Murph.<br> Hey, what's with that light?<br> I know they're in here.<br> Are you sure about this, now?<br> I am sure. Sure as hell I am.<br> All right, if they're in here,<br> now we're gonna get 'em out.<br> Okay.<br> Son of a bitch.<br> Red-haired women are bad luck, man.<br> What's the matter? What's wrong?<br> What's goin' on up there?<br> This is crazy. I must be outta my mind.<br> I told you not to listen to that fucking kid.<br> Take it easy, Red.<br> You go fuck yourself.<br> Will you shut up?<br> Shut the hell up will you, Leary.<br> I'm up to here with you, with all of ya.<br> I'm gettin' out<br> of this fuckin' coffin right now.<br> Hey! Hey!<br> Stay outta sight.<br> Go, man, go.<br> Your attention, please. This is the police.<br> Repeat. This is the police.<br> Everyone stay in your car.<br> Oh! Uh-oh!<br> Goody's hit.<br> You're gonna be dead soon anyway.<br> Stop the car.<br> Oh, Leary...<br> Are you outta your mind?<br> Stop right now or you're dead meat,<br> and you know I mean that.<br> Now, give me that gun, real slow.<br> Now, get out this side, both of ya,<br> and don't bother openin' your mouth.<br> Christ, Red, this is dumb man. This is dumb.<br> On the ground, both of you.<br> What happened to Goody?<br> I threw that little sucker out.<br> You prick!<br> Say somethin' funny now, smartass.<br> Wow.<br> Hey, kid. Hey.<br> Are you all right, kid?<br> Can you hear me?<br> You all right, boy?<br> Oh, man, I'm dizzy.<br> I'm dizzy.<br> Come on, you'll be all right.<br> Let's go.<br> Let's go, boy.<br> What happened?<br> Must've got a call on the car<br> and think it's us.<br> I need clothes.<br> We'll find Goody.<br> Dead man's clothes?<br> Come on.<br> We haven't got time to mess around.<br> Hey, you got the Silver Star.<br> You're the real hero, not Leary.<br> - Where'd you get that?<br> - Leary, it's true isn't it?<br> What difference does it make?<br> No difference I just wanted to know,<br> that's all.<br> Alarms. Alarms!<br> That's a real pisser!<br> Jesus Christ.<br> My God...<br> Okay, boys, this is where I turn off.<br> Unless you wanna see Warsaw.<br> Thanks a lot, man.<br> Impossible.<br> What are you seeing?<br> The one-room<br> school house. There it is.<br> "Moved to this site July 4th, 1972."<br> They moved it.<br> What'd they move it for?<br> Who knows?<br> History.<br> History, damn it.<br> Do you think?<br> I don't know, but it do present<br> mind-boggling possibilities.<br> Sam,<br> look at this old kerosene lamp.<br> Just a minute.
