                        Maycomb was a tired old town...<br> even in 1932, when I first knew it.<br> Some how it was hotter then.<br> Men's stiff collars<br> wilted by 9:00 in the morning.<br> Ladies bathed before noon,<br> after their 3:00 naps...<br> and by nightfall<br> were like soft tea cakes...<br> with frostin 's of sweat<br> and sweet talcum.<br> A day was 24 hours long,<br> but it seemed longer.<br> There was no hurry, for there was<br> nowhere to go and nothing to buy...<br> no money to buy it with...<br> although Maycomb County<br> had recently been told...<br> that it had nothing to fear<br> but fear itself.<br> That summer I was sixyears old.<br> - Good morning, Mr Cunningham.<br> - Mornin', miss.<br> My daddy's getting dressed.<br> Would you like me to call him for you?<br> - No, miss. I don't care to bother.<br> - Why, it's no bother, Mr Cunningham.<br> He'll be happy to see you!<br> Atticus!<br> Here's Mr Cunningham.<br> - Good morning, Walter.<br> - Mornin', Mr Finch.<br> I didn't want to bother you none.<br> I brung you these here hickory nuts<br> as part of my entailment.<br> Well, I thank you. The collards<br> we had last week were delicious.<br> - Well, mornin'.<br> - Morning.<br> Scout, I think maybe...<br> next time Mr Cunningham comes,<br> you better not call me.<br> - I thought you'd wanna thank him.<br> - I do.<br> I think it embarrasses him<br> to be thanked.<br> Why does he bring you<br> all this stuff?<br> He's payin' me<br> for some legal work I did for him.<br> - Why does he pay you like this?<br> - That's the only way he can.<br> He has no money.<br> - Is he poor?<br> - Yes.<br> - Are we poor?<br> - We are indeed.<br> Are we as poor<br> as the Cunninghams?<br> No, not exactly. Cunninghams<br> are country folks, farmers.<br> Crash hit them the hardest.<br> - Scout, call your brother.<br> - Atticus. Jem's up in the tree.<br> He says he won't come down<br> until you agree...<br> to play football<br> for the Methodists.<br> Jem.<br> Son, why don't you come on down out<br> ofthere now and have your breakfast?<br> Calpurnia has a good one.<br> Hot biscuits.<br> No, sir! Not until you agree<br> to play football for the Methodists.<br> Oh, son, I can't do that. I explained<br> to you I'm too old to get out there.<br> After all,<br> I'm the only fatheryou have.<br> Wouldn't want me to go out there<br> and get my head knocked off, would you?<br> I ain't comin' down!<br> Suit yourself.<br> Mornin'.<br> - Morning, Miss Maudie.<br> - What's goin' on over there?<br> I'm havin' a terrible time.<br> Jem's stayin' up in the tree...<br> until Atticus agrees<br> to play football for the Methodists.<br> And Atticus says he's too old.<br> Every time I'm wantin'<br> to do somethin', he's too old!<br> - He's too old for anything!<br> - He can do plenty of things.<br> You be good, children.<br> Mind Cal.<br> - Mornin', Maudie.<br> - Mornin', Atticus.<br> He won't let me have a gun...<br> and he'll only play touch football<br> with me-- never tackle.<br> He can make somebody's will<br> so airtight, you can't break it.<br> You count your blessin's<br> and stop complainin'. Both ofyou.<br> Thankyour stars<br> he has the sense to act his age.<br> -Jem, he is pretty old.<br> - I can't help that.<br> Hey.<br> - Hey yourself.<br> - I'm Charles Baker Harris.

He lives over there.<br> Boo only comes out at night<br> when you're asleep and it's pitch-dark.<br> When you wake up at night,<br> you can hear him.<br> Once I heard him scratchin'<br> on our screen door...<br> but he was gone<br> by the time Atticus got there.<br> Wonder what he does in there.<br> - Wonder what he looks like.<br> - Well...<br> judgin' from his tracks,<br> he's about six and a halffeet tall.<br> He eats raw squirrels<br> and all the cats he can catch.<br> There's a long, jagged scar<br> that runs all the way across his face.<br> His teeth are yellow and rotten,<br> his eyes are popped...<br> and he drools most ofthe time.<br> I don't believe you.<br> - Dill, what are you doin' here?<br> - My Lord, Aunt Stephanie!<br> - You almost gave me a heart attack!<br> - I don't want you playing there.<br> There's a maniac lives there,<br> and he's dangerous.<br> See?<br> I wasjust tryin' to warn him about Boo,<br> but he wouldn't believe me.<br> You just better believe him,<br> Mr Dill Harris.<br> Tell him how Boo<br> tried to kill his papa.<br> I was standin' in my yard one day<br> when his mama come out yellin'...<br> "He's killin' us all!"<br> Turned out that Boo was cuttin' up<br> the paper for his scrapbook...<br> and when his daddy come by,<br> he reached over with his scissors...<br> stabbed him in his leg, pulled them out<br> and went right on cuttin' the paper.<br> They wanted to send him to an asylum,<br> but his daddy said...<br> "No Radley's goin' to any asylum."<br> So they locked him up<br> in the basement ofthe courthouse...<br> till he nearly died ofthe damp,<br> and his daddy brought him back home.<br> There he is to this day,<br> sittin' over there with his scissors.<br> Lord knows what<br> he's doin' or thinkin'.<br> Six, seven, eight...<br> nine, ten!<br> Come on, Scout! lt's 5:00!<br> - Where you goin'?<br> - Time to meet Atticus.<br> - Why do you call your daddy Atticus?<br> - 'Cause Jem does.<br> - Why does he?<br> - I don't know.<br> Hejust started to<br> ever since he began talking.<br> Wait.

goin'."<br> I couldn't do nothin' for her.<br> And she said yes, I could.<br> And I asked her what.<br> And she said tojust step<br> on the chairyonder...<br> and get that box down<br> from on top ofthe chifforobe.<br> So I done like she told me...<br> and I was reachin'...<br> when the next thing I know,<br> she grabbed me around the legs.<br> She scared me so bad, I hopped down<br> and turned the chair over.<br> That was the only thing--<br> only furniture--<br> disturbed in the room, Mr Finch...<br> I swear, when I left it.<br> And what happened<br> afteryou turned the chair over?<br> You've sworn to tell the whole truth.<br> Will you do it?<br> What happened after that?<br> I got down offthe chair...<br> and I turned around...<br> and she sort ofjumped on me.<br> She hugged me around the waist.<br> She reached up<br> and kissed me on the face.<br> She said she'd never kissed<br> a grown man before...<br> and she might as well kiss me.<br> She says for me<br> to kiss her back...<br> and I said, "Miss Mayella,<br> let me out of here"...<br> and I tried to run.<br> Mr Ewell cussed at her<br> from the window.<br> He said he's gonna kill her.<br> What happened after that?<br> I was runnin' so fast,<br> l don't know what happened.<br> Tom, did you rape Mayella Ewell?<br> I did not, sir.<br> Did you harm her in any way?<br> I did not, sir.<br> Robinson...<br> you're good at bustin' up chifforobes<br> and kindlin' with one hand, aren't ya?<br> Strong enough to choke the breath<br> out ofa woman...<br> and sling her to the floor?<br> - I never done that, sir.<br> - But you're strong enough to.<br> I reckon so, sir.<br> How come you so all-fired anxious<br> to do that woman's chores?<br> Looks like she--<br> she didn't have nobody to help her.<br> Like I said--<br> With Mr Ewell and seven children<br> on the place?<br> You did all this choppin' and work<br> out ofsheer goodness, boy?<br> You're a mighty good fella,<br> it seems.<br> Did all that for not one penny?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I felt right sorry for her.<br> She seemed--<br> You felt sorry for her?<br> A white woman?<br> You felt sorry for her.<br> To begin with...<br> this case should never<br> have come to trial.<br> The State has not produced<br> one iota...<br> of medical evidence...<br> that the crime Tom Robinson<br> is charged with...<br> ever took place.<br> It has relied, instead...<br> upon the testimony<br> oftwo witnesses...<br> whose evidence has not only been<br> called into serious question...<br> on cross-examination...<br> but has been flatly contradicted<br> by the defendant.<br> There is circumstantial evidence<br> to indicate that...<br> Mayella Ewell was beaten...<br> savagely...<br> by someone who led,<br> almost exclusively, with his left.<br> Tom Robinson now sits before you,<br> having taken the oath...<br> with the only good hand<br> he possesses...<br> his right.<br> I have nothing but pity<br> in my heart...<br> for the chiefwitness<br> for the State.<br> She is the victim...<br> ofcruel poverty and ignorance.<br> But my pity...<br> does not extend so far...<br> as to her putting<br> a man's life at stake...<br> which she has done in an effort<br> to get rid of her own guilt.<br> I say "guilt," gentlemen...<br> because it was guilt...<br> that motivated her.<br> She's committed no crime.<br> She has merely broken<br> a rigid and time-honoured...<br> code of our society.<br> A code so severe that whoever breaks it<br> is hounded from our midst...<br> as unfit to live with.<br> She must destroy the evidence...<br> of her offence.<br> But what was the evidence<br> of her offence?<br> Tom Robinson, a human being.<br> She must put Tom Robinson<br> away from her.<br> Tom Robinson was to her<br> a daily reminder...<br> ofwhat she did.<br> Now, what did she do?<br> She tempted a Negro.<br> She was white,<br> and she tempted a Negro.<br> She did something that,<br> in our society, is unspeakable.<br> She kissed a black man.<br> Not an old uncle...<br> but a strong, young Negro man.<br> No code mattered to her<br> before she broke it...<br> but it came crashing down<br> on her afterwards.<br> The witnesses for the State...<br> with the exception<br> ofthe sheriff of Maycomb County...<br> have presented themselves<br> to you gentlemen, to this court...<br> in the cynical confidence...<br> that their testimony<br> would not be doubted.<br> Confident that you gentlemen...<br> would go along with them<br> on the assumption--<br> the evil assumption--<br> that all Negroes lie...<br> all Negroes are basically<br> immoral beings...<br> all Negro men are not<br> to be trusted around our women.<br> An assumption that one associates<br> with minds oftheir calibre...<br> and which is, in itself,<br> gentlemen, a lie.<br> Which I do not need<br> to point out to you.<br> And so...<br> a quiet, humble,<br> respectable Negro...<br> who has had<br> the unmitigated temerity...<br> to feel sorry<br> for a white woman...<br> has had to put his word<br> against two white people's.<br> The defendant is not guilty...<br> but somebody<br> in this courtroom is.<br> Now, gentlemen...<br> in this country...<br> our courts are<br> the great levellers.<br> In our courts...<br> all men are created...<br> equal.<br> I'm no idealist<br> to believe firmly...<br> in the integrity of our courts<br> and of our jury system.<br> That's no ideal to me.<br> That is a living, working reality!<br> I am confident that<br> you gentlemen will review...<br> without passion...<br> the evidence<br> that you have heard...<br> come to a decision...<br> and restore this man<br> to his family.<br> In the name of God...<br> do your duty.<br> In the name of God...<br> believe...<br> Tom Robinson.<br> How long has the jury<br> been out now, Reverend?<br> Let's see.<br> Almost two hours now.<br> I think that's an awful<br> good sign, don't you?<br> Court's now in session.<br> Everybody rise.<br> Gentlemen of the jury,<br> have you reached a verdict?<br> We have, Your Honour.<br> Will the defendant please rise<br> and face the jury.<br> What is your verdict?<br> We find the defendant<br> guilty as charged.<br> Gentlemen,<br> this jury is dismissed.<br> Court is adjourned.<br> I'll go to see Helen<br> first thing tomorrow morning.<br> I told her not to be disappointed,<br> we'd probably lose this one.<br> Miss Jean Louise.<br> Miss Jean Louise, stand up.<br> Your father's passin'.<br> I'm sorry, Atticus.<br> Thank you, Maudie.<br> Atticus, can I see you<br> for a minute?<br> Will you excuse me?<br> Yes, ma'am?<br> I don't know if it'll help...<br> but I want to say this to you.<br> There's some men<br> in this world...<br> who are born to do<br> our unpleasant jobs for us.<br> Your father's one ofthem.<br> Oh, well.<br> What's the matter, Atticus?<br> Tom Robinson's dead.<br> They were taking him<br> to Abbottsville...<br> for safekeeping.<br> Tom broke loose and ran.<br> The deputy...<br> called out to him to stop...<br> and Tom didn't stop.<br> He shot at him to wound him...<br> and missed his aim.<br> Killed him.<br> The deputy says...<br> Tom just ran like a crazy man.<br> The last thing I told him<br> was not to lose heart...<br> that we'd ask for an appeal.<br> We had such a good chance.<br> We had more than a good chance.<br> I have to go out<br> and tell his family.<br> You look after<br> the children, Maudie.<br> Atticus, you want me<br> to go with you?<br> No, son. I think l'd better<br> go out there alone.<br> I'm goin' with you.<br> All right, son.<br> Hello, Mr Finch.<br> I'm Spence, Tom's father.<br> Hello, Spence.<br> - Is Helen here?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> She's inside lyin' down,<br> tryin' to get a little sleep.<br> We been talkin'<br> about the appeal, Mr Finch.<br> How long do you think it'll take?<br> There isn't going<br> to be any appeal.<br> Not now. Tom is dead.<br> Dead?<br> Boy.<br> Go inside and tell Atticus Finch<br> l said to come out here.<br> Go on, boy.<br> By October, things<br> had settled down again.<br> I still looked for Boo everytime<br> I went bythe Radley place.<br> This night my mind<br> was filled with Halloween.<br> There was to be a pageant representing<br> our county's agricultural products.<br> I was to be a ham.<br> Jem saidhe would escort me<br> to the school auditorium.<br> Thus began our longest<br> journey together.<br> - Scout.<br> - Yeah?<br> Will you come on?<br> Everybody's gone.<br> - I can't go home like this.<br> - Well, I'm going.<br> It's almost 1 0:00,<br> and Atticus will be waitin' for us.<br> All right, I'm comin'.<br> But I feel like a fool<br> walkin' home like this.<br> It's not my fault<br> you lost your dress.<br> I didn't lose it.<br> Just can't find it.<br> - Where are your shoes?<br> - I can't find them either.<br> - You can get 'em tomorrow.<br> - But tomorrow's Sunday.<br> You can get the janitor<br> to let you in. Come on.<br> Here, Scout. Let me hold onto you<br> before you break your neck.<br> Jem, you don't have<br> to hold me.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Hush a minute, Scout.<br> I thought I heard somethin'.<br> Come on.<br> Wait.<br> Are you trying to scare me?<br> You know I'm too old.<br> Be quiet.<br> - I hear an old dog bayin'.<br> - It's not that.<br> I hear it when<br> we're walkin' along.<br> When we stop,<br> l don't hear it anymore.<br> Oh, yeah, my costume rustlin'.<br> Halloween's got ya.<br> I hear it now.<br> I'll bet it's just old<br> Cecil Jacobs tryin' to scare me.<br> Cecil Jacobs is a big, wet hen!<br> Come on.<br> Run, Scout!<br> Run, Scout! Run! Run!<br> What happened?<br> I don't know.<br> I just don't know.<br> - Tell Dr Reynolds to come over.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - You all right?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Sheriff Tate, please.<br> Atticus, isJem dead?<br> No. He's unconscious.<br> We won't know how badly he's hurt<br> until the doctor gets here.<br> Heck? Atticus Finch.<br> Someone's been after my children.<br> He's got a bad break,<br> as far as I can tell.<br> Like somebody tried<br> to wring his arm off.<br> I'll be right back, Atticus.<br> - How's the boy, Doc?<br> - He'll be all right.<br> SheriffTate.<br> What is it, Heck?<br> Bob Ewell's lyin' on the ground<br> under that tree down yonder...<br> with a kitchen knife<br> stuck up under his ribs.<br> He's dead.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> He's not gonna bother<br> these children anymore.<br> Miss Scout, you think<br> you could tell us what happened?<br> I don't know.<br> All ofa sudden somebody grabbed me,<br> knocked me down on the ground.<br> Jem found me then.<br> Then Mr Ewell, I reckon,<br> grabbed him again, and Jem hollered.<br> Then somebody grabbed me.<br> Mr Ewell, I guess.<br> Somebody grabbed him...<br> and then I heard someone<br> pantin' and coughin'.<br> Then I saw someone carryingJem.<br> Who was it?<br> There he is, Mr Tate.<br> He can tell you his name.<br> Hey, Boo.<br> MissJean Louise,<br> Mr Arthur Radley.<br> I believe he already knows you.<br> Heck, let's go out<br> on the front porch.<br> Would you like to say good night<br> toJem, Mr Arthur?<br> You can pet him, Mr Arthur.<br> He's asleep.<br> You couldn't if he was awake, though.<br> He wouldn't let you.<br> Go ahead.<br> Let's go sit in the swing,<br> Mr Arthur.<br> I guess the thing to do is--<br> Good Lord.<br> I must be losin' my memory.<br> I can't remember<br> whether Jem is 1 2 or 1 3.<br> Anyway, it'll have to...<br> come before the county court.<br> Of course, it's a clear-cut<br> case ofself-defence.<br> I'll run down to the office--<br> Mr Finch...<br> do you think Jem<br> killed Bob Ewell?<br> Is that what you think?<br> Your boy never stabbed him.<br> Bob Ewell fell on his knife.<br> He killed himself.<br> There's a black man<br> dead for no reason.<br> Now the man responsible<br> for it is dead.<br> Let the dead bury the dead<br> this time, Mr Finch.<br> I never heard tell it was<br> against the law for any citizen...<br> to do his utmost to prevent<br> a crime from being committed...<br> which is exactly what he did.<br> Maybe you'll tell me it's my duty<br> to tell the town all about it...<br> not to hush it up.<br> You know what'll happen then.<br> All the ladies in Maycomb, includin'<br> my wife, will be knockin' on his door...<br> bringin' angel food cakes.<br> To my way of thinkin',<br> takin' one man...<br> who done you and this town<br> a big service...<br> and draggin' him<br> with his shy ways into the lime light--<br> To me, that's a sin.<br> It's a sin.<br> And I'm not about<br> to have it on my head.<br> I may not be much, Mr Finch...<br> but I'm still sheriff<br> of Maycomb County...<br> and Bob Ewell fell on his knife.<br> Good night, sir.<br> Mr Tate was right.<br> What do you mean?<br> Well, it would be...<br> sort of like shooting<br> a mockingbird, wouldn't it?<br> Thank you, Arthur.<br> Thank you for my children.<br> Neighbours bring food<br> with death...<br> and flowers with sickness...<br> and little things in between.<br> Boo was our neighbour.<br> He gave us two soap dolls...<br> a broken watch and chain...<br> a knife...<br> and our lives.<br> One time Atticus said<br> you never really knew a man...<br> until you stood in his shoes<br> and walked around in them.<br> Just standin'<br> on the Radley porch was enough.<br> The summer that had begun<br> so long ago had ended...<br> and another summer<br> had taken its place...<br> anda fall.<br> And Boo Radley had come out.<br> I was to think<br> of these days many times...<br> of Jem and Dill...<br> and Boo Radley and Tom Robinson.<br> And Atticus.<br> He would be in Jem's room<br> all night...<br> and he would be there<br> when Jem waked up in the morning.<br>
