                        Our hero grew apace.<br> A country lad, far happier<br> in the woods than in the study.<br> A bad hero, it may be,<br> with many a weakness.<br> But then, if Adam hadn't had<br> such a weakness for apples,<br> there would be nobody<br> to tell Tom's story at all.<br> And a part of that story tells<br> of the sport Tom found in the woods.<br> Ah, Tom.<br> You wicked dog.<br> Molly. What are you doing here?<br> I 'eard Father tell Mother<br> you was coming.<br> It's a good night to be abroad<br> and looking for game.<br> Ah, Tom...<br> Oh, Tom...<br> It shall be our custom<br> to leave such scenes<br> where taste, decorum<br> and the censor dictate.<br> In this way, we shall try to make up<br> for our incorrigible hero.<br> As soon as he had left<br> the disreputable Molly,<br> what did he do but join her equally<br> disreputable father, Black George,<br> gamekeeper to Squire Allworthy.<br> - Come on!<br> - I hear 'em. Psst.<br> Come on, lads. We'll smoke 'em out.<br> Fetch it. Fetch it, boy. Come on.<br> Wait. That's fallen<br> on Squire Western's ground.<br> Well, let's after it.<br> No - I've been warned for trespassing.<br> It's our bird. Don't worry, Blackie.<br> - Come back! Come...<br> - Here, boy. Here, boy. Here, boy.<br> All right, you devils, I'll get you!<br> - I'll have your blood! I'll...<br> - Run, Blackie!<br> Let's give the old man<br> a run for his money.<br> Home, lads. I'll get 'em another night.<br> - I thought I'd lost you in the woods.<br> - Short cut.<br> - We'll be caught one of these days.<br> - Don't worry.<br> It's all right for you -<br> you haven't got a family to keep.<br> I'll look after you.<br> Here... Take this guinea.<br> Good night, Blackie.<br> Our hero, alas, was always being<br> exploited by villains like Black George.<br> For a generous man is merely<br> a fool in the eyes of a thief.<br> - A sheep?<br> - Aye, sir, an entire sheep.<br> A fat animal. Enough<br> to feed a village for a week.<br> Hanging up in his cottage<br> as proud as a battle trophy.<br> - This is a grave matter.<br> - A hanging matter.<br> - Sir, if I may speak on his behalf, I'd...<br> - Be silent.<br> Are you guilty?<br> I am... guilty...<br> - Sir, forgive him.<br> - Be quiet, sir. I have to do justice here.<br> You have committed a capital crime.<br> The laws have provided the most terrible<br> To hang by your neck.<br> But you have children.<br> For their sake, I shall only<br> dismiss you from my service.<br> And may God have mercy on you.<br> You're too lenient, Mr Allworthy.<br> Compassion is one thing, sir,<br> but justice is another.<br> Mr Thwackum and Mr Square<br> were Tom's tutors.<br> Over the years, they tried -<br> with little success -<br> to thrash into Tom<br> a sense of virtue and religion.<br> They had, however, a more apt pupil.<br> Soon after Tom had been found,<br> the squire's sister Bridget married<br> a Captain Blifil, and they had a son.<br> This young man was<br> quite different from Tom.<br> He was sober, discreet<br> and pious beyond his age,<br> and the whole neighbourhood<br> resounded in his praise.<br> You have only taught Tom to laugh at<br> whatever is decent and virtuous and right.<br> - I've taught him religion.<br> - Mr Thwackum, the word "religion"<br> is as vague and uncertain<br> as any in the English language.<br> By "religion" I mean the Christian religion.<br> Not only that, but the Protestant religion.<br> And not only that,<br> but the Church of England.<br> I fear that Tom is the embodiment<br> of the old truth<br> that foundlings<br> should be left to the parish.<br> My dear tutors, I'm afraid neither of you<br> can touch his bastard's heart.<br> Neither indeed.<br> But there was another who could.<br> Tom...<br> - I want you to help me.<br> - How?<br> I want you to get me a post, Tom.<br> Mm-hm...<br> Miss Western's come back from France<br> and'll be wantin' a maid.<br> I'll speak to her.<br> Tom, you are kind to me.<br> Miss Western's maid!<br> Sophie Western! Miss Western!<br> Why, Tom Jones!<br> I've brought you a thrush.<br> He's beautiful, Tom. How kind of you.<br> Two years is a long time. Did they teach<br> you London ways, make a lady of you?<br> Most of the time I was in France.<br> My aunt took me there.<br> - Did you like France, Meez Western?<br> - Mais oui. Je me suis trs bien amuse.<br> - Ah, bon.<br> - You haven't changed, Tom.<br> You've grown, Sophie.<br> Grown more beautiful than ever.<br> Doesn't he sing beautifully?<br> I shall teach him some new songs.<br> I doubt if an English bird<br> can learn French songs.<br> You'll see.<br> Avignon<br> Sur le pont d'Avignon...<br> We're asked to supper. I came early to ask<br> if you'd help Black George's daughter.<br> Oh, yes. He stole a sheep, didn't he?<br> Black George is a poor man.<br> With big, hungry daughters to feed.<br> Most hungry - I can vouch for it.<br> I have a maid already.<br> But I'll see what I can do.<br> Good, good.<br> Ah! Welcome, neighbours! Welcome!<br> - How nice to see you.<br> - Welcome, madam. Welcome, Squire.<br> Good day, Western, good day.<br> - Look! Tom brought me a thrush!<br> - What a sweet little bird!<br> His song is sweeter<br> than any tune of Mr Handel's.<br> Ugh, Handel!<br> Tom, thank you.<br> Welcome home, Sophie.<br> How lovely you're looking, child.<br> Aye, it's good to have her home.<br> Let's all go in to dinner.<br> - Oh dear.<br> - Oh, my little bird!<br> Don't worry, Sophie,<br> I'll get it back for you.<br> - Tom...<br> - Good lad, Tom.<br> Be careful, Tom! Tom, take care!<br> - I'll wager he gets it.<br> - Take care.<br> I am sorry to cause you this distress,<br> Miss Western.<br> I did not think the bird would fly away.<br> But I cannot help observing<br> that the idea of caged birds<br> is against the laws of nature.<br> Don't you agree, Mr Square?<br> He's got him!<br> Argh!<br> He'll drown! Quick, pick him up!<br> Help him, someone!<br> - Oh, Tom, you're soaked!<br> - Come on, lad, give me your hand.<br> Damn me if I won't love the boy for this<br> as long as I have to live!<br> Serves him right.<br> And you, sir.<br> The weeks passed...<br> and Molly grew apace too.<br> Ah, you lazy slut, you!<br> Look at her, with that great belly on her!<br> That I should have lived to see this day!<br> You'd better have minded what the parson<br> said and not harkened after menfolks.<br> She's the first of this family to be a whore!<br> Mother, you yourself was brought to bed<br> with sister there a week after you married.<br> Ah, but I were made an honest woman of.<br> But you, you have to be doing with<br> gentlemen, don't you, you nasty slut, you!<br> You will have a bastard!<br> And I defy anybody to say that of me.<br> - My gentlemen'll look after me.<br> - Your gentlemen! Far from gentlemen!<br> You lay off me, or I'll tell my gentlemen...<br> ...if these be constantly applied,<br> And then, though we cannot<br> absolutely promise success,<br> yet we may properly say with the apostle<br> "What knowest thou, O wife,<br> whether thou shalt save thy husband?"<br> And now, my dear brethren,<br> let us sing together the hymn<br> "O God, Our Help in Ages Past. "<br> O God, our help in ages past<br> Our hope for years to come...<br> "Let dogs delight to bark and bite,<br> For God hath made them so. "<br> "Let bears and lions growl and fight,<br> For 'tis their nature too. "<br> "But, ladies, you should never let<br> Such angry passions rise. "<br> "Your little hands were never made<br> To tear each other's eyes. "<br> There she is! Let's get at her!<br> Let's thrash her!<br> Don't want the likes of her in this village!<br> Won't have her mixing with us good folk!<br> Take that, you hussy!<br> I'll get you, Goody Brown,<br> you dirty old harridan!<br> Oh, Tom... Please, Tom...<br> Don't... Don't leave me, Tom.<br> Slowly. Slowly.<br> That filthy slut.<br> Ah, good boy, good boy!<br> He's a game lad, your Tom.<br> So, the wench is having a bastard?<br> Yes. It seems the girl has refused<br> to name the father to Mr Allworthy.<br> He may have to send her to Bridewell.<br> - Father, I have a headache.<br> - I smoke it.<br> I smoke it!<br> Tom is the father of that bastard!<br> Aye! As sure as tuppence,<br> Tom is the bastard's father!<br> Father...<br> Odds zodikins!<br> What a little whoremaster that boy is!<br> The girl is ruined, surely.<br> Aye! Ruined. Ruined for sure!<br> Once broken, never mended, eh?<br> Lt'll do no harm. Ask Sophie.<br> She knows about Tom.<br> You have no worse opinion of a young<br> fellow for getting a bastard, have you?<br> Will you stop bobbing up and down, girl!<br> No, no. The women will like him<br> the better for it, won't they?<br> - Sophie, sing us one of your jolly songs.<br> - Not tonight, Father. I have a headache.<br> Let's have "St George, He Was<br> for England" or "Bobbing Joan".<br> That's a good song for tonight, eh?<br> None of your old Handel now,<br> my little darling.<br> Ah, you play like an angel.<br> Molly's reputation was destroyed,<br> and Tom's heart was heavy with remorse.<br> Perhaps Mr Square had been right,<br> that the wicked are snared<br> in the work of their own hands.<br> Oh. Mr Jones.<br> - Where's Molly?<br> - Oh, she... she ain't home.<br> She's upstairs. In bed.<br> - Who is it?<br> - It's me. Tom.<br> Why haven't you been<br> to see me before this, Tom?<br> - Molly, I...<br> - Agh!<br> - You said you'd be my gentleman!<br> - I hope to explain why...<br> You'll not admit you've had<br> your wicked will of me?!<br> - Molly...<br> - No.<br> I shall never love<br> another man but you, Tom.<br> Not if the greatest squire in the country<br> came a-courtin',<br> I couldn't give myself to him!<br> No, Tom, not for all the riches in the<br> world, now that you've gained my heart.<br> You are a lecherous rascal after all, Tom!<br> I shall always hate and despise<br> the whole sex on account of you, Tom!<br> Mr Square.<br> Molly's favours, after all,<br> had not been bestowed on Tom alone.<br> Our hero, unlike many other men,<br> was fortunate enough to discover<br> the father of his child in time.<br> And after everyone's kindness, too.<br> She has laid the child<br> at young Mr Jones's door.<br> All the parish say Mr Allworthy is so angry<br> with Mr Jones that he won't see him.<br> To be sure, one can't help<br> pitying the poor young man.<br> He's so pretty a gentleman. I should<br> be sorry to see him turned out-of-doors.<br> Why do you tell me all this? What concern<br> have I in what Mr Jones does?<br> Why, ma'am, I never thought it was any<br> harm to say a young man was handsome.<br> But I shall never think of him any more<br> now. For handsome is as handsome does.<br> Tittle-tattle, tittle-tattle.<br> I shall be late for the hunt.<br> Sorry, I'm sure, madam.<br> Everyone in my household!<br> Where's the cider?<br> Greetings! Greetings!<br> - Greetings, Thwackum.<br> - Morning, Squire. Morning, Miss Western.<br> Welcome, everyone.<br> Morning, Western.<br> Oh, you brute!<br> - Morning.<br> - And you, sir.<br> Ah, you're getting no younger.<br> I mean the horse, madam.<br> A stirrup cup, everyone!<br> Come, help yourselves, everyone!<br> Plenty to eat and drink!<br> Here. The Church is always first<br> with the bread and wine.<br> Health to everyone!<br> French miss isn't speaking today?<br> Drink up, everyone.<br> - Huntsmen, loose the hounds.<br> - Another tankard, please.<br> Come on, boys and girls!<br> Come on, come on!<br> Have a drop of cider inside you, boy.<br> Then you'll be ready for the kill.<br> Come on, drink up. Drink up, everyone.<br> Come on, drink up!<br> Some Western brew for you, my girl!<br> Squire, it's too early! You'll tire yourself!<br> Quiet, everyone.<br> Good health and good hunting!<br> Come on, Sophie! Hurry, hurry!<br> Come on, sweetheart! After him!<br> Tally-ho!<br> Ahhh! Here he is!<br> - I trust you're not harmed.<br> - No, no. How can I ever thank you?<br> If I have preserved you, madam,<br> I am sufficiently repaid. Agh...<br> I hope you're not hurt.<br> If I have broken my arm, it is a trifle<br> compared to my fears on your account.<br> Broken your arm?!<br> I'm afraid I have, madam.<br> Yet I have another to lead you home.<br> Look at him, ma'am. He's the most<br> handsome man I ever saw in my life.<br> Why, Honor, I do believe<br> you're in love with him.<br> I assure you, ma'am, I'm not.<br> If you were, I see no reason<br> that you should be ashamed of it.<br> For he is certainly a handsome fellow.<br> That he is - the most handsome man<br> I ever saw in my life.<br> And, as you say, ma'am, I don't know why<br> I should be ashamed of looking at him,<br> even though he is my better.<br> For gentlefolk are but flesh and blood,<br> like us servants.<br> I am an honest person's child,<br> and my mother and father were married -<br> which is more than some people can say.<br> Honor!<br> My grandfather was a clergyman,<br> and he'd have been very angry<br> to have thought any of his family had<br> taken up with Molly Seagrim's leavings.<br> Why, ma'am,<br> the young gentleman is awake.<br> Yes. You've awakened him<br> with your foolish chatter.<br> I feel awake for the first time, madam.<br> "... after narrow scru...<br> narrow scrutiny,<br> found some magical books... " Ha-haar!<br> "... several vials of strange liquors,<br> pots of ointment... "<br> Remember that picnic, Sister, last year,<br> when Western sat on a wasps' nest?<br> I shall never forget it!<br> Oh, it's so beautiful this summer.<br> Brother... Brother...<br> - Brother!<br> - Whoa! Whoa!<br> - I can't...<br> - It's all right. It's all right.<br> Why the long face, Blif?<br> - Such a terrible thing.<br> - What's happened?<br> There's been an accident.<br> My mother is dead.<br> Blif...<br> And Squire Allworthy?<br> He's not expected to live.<br> Shh.<br> Fever has developed and there<br> is little hope. We can only pray.<br> Something for which<br> you have scant relish!<br> "Forasmuch as it hath pleased<br> Almighty God of his great mercy<br> to take unto himself the soul<br> of our dear sister here departed,<br> we therefore commit<br> her body to the ground,<br> earth to earth,<br> ashes to ashes,<br> dust to dust,<br> in sure and certain hope<br> of the resurrection to eternal life,<br> through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. "<br> Well, there's another one gone.<br> So sorry.<br> Cheer up, lad.<br> She will be with the angels, my boy.<br> Our mortal forms are but shadows<br> of a purer reality.<br> - Thank you for your comforting words.<br> - She was a great lady.<br> Sir, some time before your mother died<br> she gave me a letter.<br> Her instructions were to hand it<br> to Mr Allworthy as she was buried.<br> I will give it to my uncle.<br> She expressly said<br> into no hands but Mr Allworthy's.<br> Lawyer Dowling, if my uncle lives<br> he will need a new steward.<br> I intend to recommend you.<br> You are most kind, sir.<br> Do not grieve, my dear nephew.<br> Do not grieve.<br> Sir, you cannot die.<br> Death comes to us all, Tom.<br> I have asked you here<br> to tell you of my will.<br> Nephew Blifil, I leave you heir to my<br> whole estate, with these exceptions.<br> To you, my dear Tom,<br> I have given an estate of Pounds. 800 a year,<br> together with Pounds. 1,000 in ready money.<br> I am convinced, my boy,<br> that you have much goodness,<br> generosity and honour in your nature.<br> If you will add prudence and religion<br> to these, you must be happy.<br> Pounds. 1,000 I leave to you, Mr Thwackum,<br> and a like sum to you, Mr Square -<br> which I am convinced exceeds<br> your desires as well as your wants.<br> As for my servants,<br> for Marjorie and Jane, Pounds. 100 each.<br> "... my soul shall praise the Lord<br> even to death,<br> and my life was drawing<br> near to hell beneath... "<br> Mr Allworthy's recovered!<br> It's over! The fever's gone!<br> He's sitting up! He's well again!<br> The squire's recovered!<br> It's over!<br> It is not true that drink<br> changes a man's character.<br> It can reveal it more clearly.<br> The Squire's recovery brought joy to Tom,<br> to his tutors sheer disappointment.<br> Sing, thick Thwackum,<br> your bounty's flown...<br> You have good reason for your<br> drunkenness, you beggarly bastard!<br> - He's provided well enough for you!<br> - Do you think that could weigh with me?<br> - Damn you, Thwackum!<br> - How dare you, sir?!<br> And damn me<br> if I don't open another bottle.<br> I shall sing you a ballad, entitled "Sing,<br> thick Thwackum, thy bounty has flown".<br> Sing, thick Thwackum,<br> thy bounty's flown<br> You've lost all the money<br> you thought that you'd own...<br> Mr Jones!<br> This house is in mourning on account<br> of the death of my dear mother.<br> Oh, sir, forgive me.<br> The joy of Mr Allworthy's recovery...<br> I had the misfortune<br> to know who my parents were.<br> Consequently, I'm grieved by their loss.<br> You rascal. Do you dare to insult me?<br> Gentlemen, gentlemen!<br> This behaviour is most unseemly.<br> Oh, Master Blifil!<br> Oh, that vulgar animal! Out with him!<br> All right, we'll go outside!<br> Let's have some wine!<br> Get him out! Get him out!<br> How dare you throw me out?<br> Shall we take the evening air?<br> It is widely held that too much wine<br> will dull a man's desire.<br> Indeed it will - in a dull man.<br> Sophia...<br> Sophie...<br> I'll carve her name on this tree!<br> Tree, do you mind<br> if I carve the name of my Sophia?<br> Big S for Sophia... Sophie...<br> Sophie, Sophia...<br> So... Molly...<br> Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly...<br> M for Molly...<br> Are you aimin' to slit my throat, Squire?<br> Would you like... a sip of my wine?<br> Mm.<br> I never had a sip<br> of a gentleman's wine before.<br> Oh, it's very potent!<br> What are you laughin' at, Tom?<br> I'm thinking of Square in your bedroom!<br> To those who find our hero's behaviour<br> startling, the answer is simple.:<br> Tom had always thought<br> that any woman was better than none,<br> while Molly never felt that one man<br> was quite as good as two.<br> - He has a wench!<br> - A wench?<br> - Let's go and find the wicked girl.<br> - Yes!<br> Who's that?<br> - How dare you?!<br> - Thwacky! Ha-ha!<br> Mr Jones, control yourself!<br> How disgraceful!<br> Go away, sir! Go away, sir!<br> Take that, you wicked fool!<br> You there! Damnation to you!<br> Stop it! Stop! What's the matter with you?<br> Damnation to you! Get over there!<br> Whoa, there! Three falling onto one?<br> Whoa! The whip!<br> Come, lass, see to Tom.<br> He's in a devilish pickle, I promise you.<br> Tom... Shh. Poor Tom. Shh.<br> - Sophie, dear...<br> - Shh. I'll fetch some water.<br> - What are you brawling about, Tom?<br> - If you search the bushes you'll find out.<br> You lickerish dog, you!<br> Where is she? Where's Tom's pussy?<br> Puss, puss, puss, puss...<br> Where's Tom's pussy? Puss, puss, puss...<br> Sophie, I...<br> Come. After him.<br> - Sophie!<br> - Tom. Tom! Come and sup with me.<br> Gentlemen, let us make our peace<br> over a bottle.<br> Sir, it is no slight matter for a man<br> of my character to be buffeted by a boy<br> just for trying to bring<br> a wanton harlot to justice!<br> The fault lies with Mr Allworthy<br> and yourself, sir.<br> If you would put<br> the right laws into execution,<br> you would soon rid the country<br> of these... vermin.<br> Ha! I'd sooner rid the country of foxes!<br> Come, you sup with me. Damn me<br> if there's nothing I wouldn't give you -<br> except my hounds<br> and my favourite mare, Miss Slouch.<br> Up...<br> Away, Miss Slouch!<br> Let us tell Mr Allworthy<br> how the monster has behaved!<br> No, sirs, I beg of you, let us wait.<br> A better time will come.<br> Odds zodikins, it's me sister's coach.<br> What brings her from London?<br> I hope the old bitch has gone to bed.<br> Come, Sophie, sing us<br> one of your jolly songs, my girl.<br> Father, I do not feel well.<br> I think I shall go to bed.<br> Not before you attend to your guest.<br> Tom here has a great thirst, I warrant you.<br> Western? What are these nocturnal riots?<br> - Now lookie here, Sister...<br> - Sophie?<br> - Yes, Aunt?<br> - To bed.<br> - Bed?<br> - Bed!<br> I'd be glad to, madam.<br> Now lookie here, Sister!<br> Brother, as I am here to stay a while,<br> I shall sign a peace treaty with you.<br> Sister, I've often warned you<br> not to talk that court gibberish to me.<br> I pity your country ignorance<br> from my heart.<br> And I despise your citified claptrap!<br> I'd rather be anything than a courtier,<br> or a... or a Presbyterian,<br> or a crawler around<br> one of those damned German kings,<br> as I believe some people are.<br> If you mean me, I'm a woman of...<br> Yes, and a good thing for you that you are.<br> If you were a man, I'd have<br> lent you a flick long ago!<br> Brother, I think you are a perfect goat.<br> Good night, sir.<br> Good night, Sister.<br> Brother!<br> Brother!<br> Brother!<br> Oh, stop!<br> Brother!<br> Brother, have you not noticed something<br> very extraordinary about Sophie lately?<br> Tell me, then. You know I love that girl<br> more than my own soul.<br> Well, unless I am deceived,<br> my niece is desperately in love.<br> In love?<br> In love?! Without my consent?!<br> I'll disinherit her!<br> I'll cast her out-of-doors<br> stark naked without a farthing!<br> Where is she?<br> Supposing she should have fixed on<br> the very person you would have wished?<br> No. No! She can love whom she pleases,<br> but she'll marry the man I choose!<br> But she has fixed on the very person<br> you would have wished!<br> - What?<br> - What think you of Mr Blifil?<br> - Young Blifil?<br> - Well, who else could there be?<br> In this rude country and society.<br> Who else is of her class?<br> 'Fore George...<br> Nothing could lie handier together<br> than Allworthy's estates and mine.<br> Come, Sister.<br> What do you advise me to do?<br> I think you should propose the match<br> to Mr Allworthy... immediately.<br> I will propose it.<br> Saddle my horse!<br> Well, Nephew, how do you feel about this<br> marriage between you and Miss Western?<br> - I will do exactly as you wish, Uncle.<br> - Oh, come, sir.<br> That is a cold answer when confronted by<br> the prospect of so beautiful a young lady.<br> My dear Uncle,<br> I am well aware of the many pleasures<br> of that noble institution, marriage,<br> and I will gladly call upon the young lady<br> at any time she will receive me.<br> Good. You shall call upon her<br> this very afternoon.<br> Sophie, dear,<br> what book is that you're reading?<br> A sad one.<br> - You blush, my dear Sophie.<br> - I have no thoughts to be ashamed of.<br> Now, Sophie, you know how I love you.<br> You know the easiness of my nature.<br> I have not always been like this.<br> I used to be thought cruel -<br> by the men, I mean.<br> I was called "the cruel Parthenissa".<br> Now come.<br> I have news that will delight you.<br> What news, Aunt?<br> This very afternoon your father has<br> arranged for you to receive your lover.<br> My lover?<br> He's coming?! This afternoon?!<br> Yes. And you're to put on<br> all your best airs.<br> Why, Aunt!<br> You almost frighten me out of my senses!<br> You will come to yourself again.<br> He's a charming young fellow.<br> Dear, dear Aunt... I know<br> none of such perfections.<br> So brave, and yet so gentle.<br> So handsome.<br> What matters his being baseborn?<br> Baseborn? What do you mean?<br> - Mr Blifil, baseborn?<br> - Mr Blifil?<br> Mr Blifil. Of whom else<br> have we been talking?<br> - Why, Mr Jones!<br> - Mr Jones?!<br> Mr Blifil?! You can't be in earnest!<br> Oh, then I am<br> the most unhappy woman alive.<br> How can you think of disgracing your<br> family by allying yourself to a... bastard?<br> Madam, you have extorted this from me.<br> Whatever were my thoughts<br> of that poor, unhappy Mr Jones,<br> I had intended to carry them to the grave.<br> I would rather follow you to that grave<br> than see you disgrace us<br> by such a match!<br> Yes! Yes!<br> No, no, no, no, no!<br> I will not marry that idiot!<br> To force me to do so would be to kill me!<br> Then die and be damned!<br> Damn me! What a misery it is<br> to have daughters,<br> when a man has a good mare and dogs.<br> Tom, that pig-headed hussy<br> dares to refuse to marry Mr Blifil.<br> I'll turn her penniless out-of-doors<br> if she doesn't!<br> Go to her, lad, and see what you can do.<br> Sophie! Sophie!<br> - Sophie!<br> - Sophie!<br> No! No! No, no! No!<br> - Sophie!<br> - Brother! Brother!<br> Sophie!<br> Sophie... Sophie...<br> Sophie, Sophie... Shh.<br> My dearest, promise<br> you won't give yourself to Blifil.<br> - Don't say that name to me!<br> - Tell me, tell me I may hope!<br> Tom, you must go.<br> - Sophie, please...<br> - Or you'll be destroyed.<br> The only destruction I fear is the loss<br> of my Sophie. I cannot part with you.<br> Can't I make you understand,<br> you country clot?<br> Tom Jones?<br> Damnation!<br> Where is he? That parasite!<br> That home-wrecker! Where is he?<br> There they are!<br> Tom, you must go. Quick, Tom, quick.<br> Run, Tom, run!<br> Come back here!<br> - I'll get thee if I hang for it!<br> - Tom, run!<br> - Sophie, please!<br> - Run, Tom!<br> You there! Allworthy!<br> - A fine piece of work you've done!<br> - What can be the matter, Mr Western?<br> My daughter has fallen in love<br> with your bastard!<br> That's what comes of trying<br> to raise a bastard as a gentleman,<br> and letting him go visiting<br> to nice folks' houses.<br> - I'm sorry to hear you say this.<br> - A pox on your sorrow!<br> I've lost my only daughter.<br> My poor Sophie, the joy of my heart.<br> Little did I think,<br> when I loved him as a sportsman,<br> that he was all the while<br> a- poaching my daughter!<br> I wish you had not given him<br> so many opportunities with her.<br> What the devil did she<br> have to do with him?<br> He came a-huntin' with me,<br> not a-courtin' to her!<br> What are we to do, Mr Western?<br> Keep the rascal away from my house<br> until I lock the wench up.<br> I'll make her marry Mr Blifil here<br> if it's the last thing I do.<br> I'll have no other son-in-law but you.<br> So go to her, you jolly dog, you.<br> I tell you, you shall have her.<br> And as for that son-of-a-whore Jones,<br> if I catch him anywhere near my gal,<br> I'll qualify him to run<br> for the Gelding's Plate!<br> Come on, Miss Slouch, come on.<br> Even the best of horsemen<br> should avoid the bottle.<br> However, the forces of sobriety<br> were gathering in all their strength<br> against our hero.<br> We draw your attention<br> to the abominable behaviour of Mr Jones.<br> He is a monster of depravity and should<br> be expelled from your house this instant.<br> You let her out of her room<br> after I locked her in?<br> Women are convinced<br> by reason, not by force.<br> I am in the wrong!<br> As soon as she came back<br> to live with you, Brother,<br> she imbibed these romantic notions.<br> You don't imagine, do you,<br> that I taught her such things?<br> Your ignorance, Brother, as the great<br> Milton says, almost subdues my patience.<br> Damn Milton!<br> If he had the impudence to be here<br> and say it to my face, I'd lend him a flick.<br> Come on, my girl.<br> He was, according to the vulgar phrase,<br> whistle drunk.<br> On the very day of your utmost danger, he<br> filled the house with riot and debauchery.<br> And he even struck Master Blifil.<br> How?! Did he dare strike you?<br> Oh, Uncle, I'm sure<br> I've forgiven him for that long ago.<br> But the same evening<br> we unluckily saw him... with a girl...<br> in a manner not fit to be mentioned.<br> Mr Thwackum advanced to rebuke him<br> when, I am sorry to say,<br> he fell upon the worthy man<br> and beat him outrageously.<br> Tell me, child, what objection<br> can you have to the young gentleman?<br> A very solid objection, in my opinion -<br> I hate him.<br> Well, I have known many couples<br> who have entirely disliked each other<br> lead very comfortable, genteel lives.<br> Madam, I assure you,<br> I shall never marry a man I detest.<br> I still believe the young man<br> to have a few redeeming graces.<br> Some of the crimes you accuse him of<br> sprang from his mistaken compassion<br> for the gamekeeper and his family.<br> Compassion, sir? Lust!<br> All his gifts, his so-called generosity,<br> were merely bribes<br> to debauch another innocent.<br> As you know, the unfortunate Molly...<br> Miss Sophie Western<br> will be the next to be undone.<br> All this I would have revealed long ago,<br> had not Master Blifil begged me<br> to give him another chance.<br> Send him to me.<br> Tom, I have forgiven you<br> too often in the past<br> out of compassion for your youth<br> and in hope of your improvement.<br> You must leave my house for ever.<br> However, I have educated you<br> like my own child<br> and would not turn you naked<br> into this world.<br> Here is something which will enable you,<br> with industry, to get a good employment.<br> Goodbye, Tom.<br> Goodbye, sir.<br> Goodbye, sir.<br> Stay, boy. Stay.<br> Mr Allworthy is very sensible<br> of the many advantages<br> of binding our two estates together.<br> Indeed?<br> I had not realised Mr Allworthy was<br> so interested in questions of property.<br> Oh, he is.<br> And you?<br> I? Well, naturally my attentions<br> are set constantly<br> on those most blissful and sanctified<br> pleasures of holy matrimony.<br> Clandestine amours so soon, Mr Blifil?<br> I pray you, Aunt, excuse me.<br> I feel a little... faint.<br> The fox, Mr Blifil, the fox.<br> Tally-ho!<br> It is you who have taught her<br> disobedience, Brother.<br> You are such a boor!<br> Boar? I am no boar! No! Nor ass!<br> Ah, more-than-gothic ignorance!<br> As for your manners, they deserve a cane!<br> And yours I despise<br> as much as I do a fart!<br> And as for your niece, I'm going<br> to lock her up in my tower this time!<br> You'll do nothing of the sort!<br> - Honor, promise to keep your word.<br> - I can't, madam. I'm frightened. I can't.<br> - I'm frightened, madam.<br> - Aaargh! Aaargh!<br> Got you, my girl! Come on!<br> Come on. You won't get out this time,<br> I warrant you!<br> Our hero was now on the road to London.<br> His first adventure was with a party<br> of those men whose profligate ways<br> could be conducted with safety<br> only under the protection of red coats.<br> Good day, gentlemen.<br> Which way are you heading?<br> - North, to fight for the Protestant cause.<br> - Against Prince Charles?<br> Those damned Scots<br> are already on their way to England.<br> I've been walking all day and I'm hungry.<br> May I buy some food and drink?<br> - Right, give him some.<br> - Thank you, Sergeant.<br> - Good day, Captain.<br> - Good day.<br> I perceive you are a gentleman.<br> We should be glad to<br> welcome you into our company.<br> - I'd be glad to march with you.<br> - Good. We shall be on the march shortly.<br> There comes a time when men<br> in a constant state of readiness for war<br> will slip their leash and fight like dogs.<br> I believe... that a man can fight for<br> no nobler cause than that of his religion.<br> Hear, hear.<br> I'd like to propose a toast<br> to the Protestant cause.<br> Smoke the prig out, Northerton.<br> Smoke him.<br> Sir, were you ever at university?<br> Sir, so far from having been at university,<br> I was never at school.<br> Me neither!<br> I only presumed, sir, from the information<br> of your great learning.<br> Sir, it is as easy for a man not to have<br> been at school and know something<br> as it is for a man to have been at school<br> and know nothing.<br> Well said, young volunteer.<br> Upon my word, Northerton, you'd best let<br> him alone or he'll prove too hard for you.<br> Give us a toast, young fellow.<br> Fill up his cup.<br> I would like to propose a toast...<br> to the health, and bless the name...<br> of Miss Sophie Western.<br> Sophie Western.<br> Sophie Western?<br> I knew one Sophie Western - was lain with<br> by half the young fellows at Bath.<br> Perhaps this is the same woman.<br> Miss Western is a lady<br> of fashion and fortune.<br> Oh aye, so she is, so she is!<br> Aye, it is the same young lady.<br> I'll lay half a dozen of Burgundy<br> Tom French of our regiment<br> had her in the tavern at Bridge Street!<br> Sophie Western!<br> Sir! I can bear no jesting<br> with this lady's character.<br> Jesting? Damn me if I was<br> ever more in earnest in my life.<br> Tom French of our regiment<br> had her and her aunt together at Bath.<br> You are the most impudent<br> rascal on earth!<br> You've killed him, you swine!<br> Zounds, I was but in jest with the fellow.<br> I never heard of Miss Western in my life.<br> Then you deserve to be hanged. You are<br> under arrest. Sergeant, take him away.<br> Arrest him.<br> But a hero cannot be lost<br> until his tale is told.<br> For, heaven be thanked,<br> we live in such an age<br> where no man dies for love<br> except upon the stage.<br> I'll kill you, Northerton...<br> I'm going to kill you, Northerton!<br> Northerton... Northerton...<br> Must find Northerton.<br> Must find Northerton...<br> Northerton!<br> Northerton!<br> Northerton!<br> Northerton!<br> Help! Help!<br> The ghost walks!<br> Shh! Shh!<br> Shh-shh-shh!<br> Come on, you, get up.<br> I can't afford for you<br> to lie here idle any longer.<br> Get out and follow<br> them rascally friends of yours!<br> You soldiers call yourselves gentlemen,<br> but it's we who have to pay for you -<br> and keep you too, for that matter!<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - That Lt Northerton escaped last night.<br> The rest of the company<br> went in pursuit after him -<br> and conveniently left<br> without paying the bill.<br> - How could he have escaped?<br> - His doxy, a trollop called Mrs Waters.<br> The sentry disappeared<br> and she let him out.<br> She'll soon learn what kind of a man he is.<br> Nothing's good enough for sparks like<br> him, but paying the bill is another matter!<br> Don't worry, madam.<br> I will repay you handsomely.<br> Ah, sir... A nice young<br> gentleman like yourself<br> shouldn't want to get mixed up<br> with them rough soldiers.<br> - It's gone.<br> - What's gone?<br> I had a Pounds. 500 note in my breeches pocket<br> and it's gone!<br> - That's a likely story.<br> - I had Pounds. 500...<br> - You never had Pounds. 500 in your life!<br> - One single note of Pounds. 500, and it's gone!<br> - I should've known your kind...<br> - Who took it?!<br> Somebody's been in this room during the<br> night and taken Pounds. 500 out of my pocket!<br> Was it you? Did you see her take it?<br> Somebody took the Pounds. 500 out of...<br> You lying rascal! Nor them cheating<br> redcoat friends of yours, neither!<br> Go on, take your things<br> and get out of here quick!<br> Go on! I'll set the dogs on you<br> if you don't hurry up!<br> You blackguard! Robber!<br> The whole lot of you! You and your Pounds. 500!<br> Wake up, you country stewpot!<br> Your daughter, sir!<br> While you've been lying a-bubbling here,<br> your daughter is gone!<br> Rouse yourself from this pastoral torpor.<br> Your daughter is gone!<br> What?!<br> Come on, you lazy lot, and take the<br> London road! Come on, Miss Slouch!<br> - Are you wanting anything, madam?<br> - We're tired and in need of refreshment.<br> It'd be an honour to serve such a lady.<br> Has by any chance a young gentleman,<br> a Mr Jones, passed this way?<br> Indeed he has. I'm surprised at a lady<br> like you inquiring of the likes of him -<br> brawling, thieving, bragging about<br> his mistress - one Sophie Western.<br> - Sophie Western?<br> - I'm not surprised, after Molly Seagrim.<br> - But I am the same Sophie Western.<br> - Well, you can get out of here quick!<br> Go on! Follow your fine friend. Take<br> your fine airs and graces with you!<br> This is a respectable house!<br> We don't want the likes of you here!<br> Our hero's next adventure<br> concerns a lady in circumstances<br> from which any gentleman<br> would instinctively wish to free her -<br> but of which any man<br> who was not a gentleman<br> might instantly want to take advantage.<br> Let her go, villain!<br> You savage!<br> Aaargh!<br> Sure, I've only myself to blame for trusting<br> in a man so unworthy of my favours.<br> No, sir - you've had trouble enough.<br> My nakedness may well shame me. I'd go<br> alone, but for the need of your protection.<br> Well then, in case<br> any prying eyes should offend you,<br> I will walk ahead<br> and escort you as far as Up... Upton.<br> So Tom and Mrs Waters - for so the lady<br> was called - set out on the road to Upton,<br> Tom, like Orpheus leading<br> Eurydice out of Hell,<br> hardly daring to look back<br> in case the fires consumed him.<br> Sophie! Sophie Western!<br> Sophie!<br> - Cousin Sophie!<br> - Look, ma'am, 'tis Mrs Fitzpatrick!<br> - My cousin Harriet?<br> - The same.<br> Why, so it is.<br> - Cousin!<br> - Harriet!<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I'm on my way to London.<br> That is my destination. But why<br> are you both on one horse, indeed?<br> Oh, Harriet,<br> I am running away from home.<br> And I too - running away<br> from my husband, Mr Fitzpatrick,<br> who's hot on my trail, I'm sure.<br> Oh, never marry an Irishman -<br> particularly if he is eaten up with jealousy,<br> possessed of a quick temper,<br> and a mighty fool into the bargain.<br> But what will you do alone in London?<br> I have a friend. He has taken lodgings<br> for me in Curzon Street.<br> Cousin.<br> He's a dear, kind man,<br> and a peer of the realm.<br> You can stay with me.<br> - May I?<br> - Come on.<br> - But your friend.<br> - He is away for a few days.<br> When he returns<br> we will make other arrangements.<br> Now get in, Cousin,<br> and tell me about yourself.<br> Landlady, two rooms, please.<br> And perhaps you'd find this lady a gown.<br> She's been involved in an accident<br> and deprived of her clothes.<br> Take us to our rooms at once.<br> Heroes - whatever high ideals we may<br> have of them - are mortal, not divine.<br> We are all as God made us,<br> and many of us much worse.<br> All right, all right, I'm coming.<br> I'm coming, I said!<br> - Where's me wife?<br> - Who?<br> Me wife! Mrs Fitzpatrick.<br> I have come a distance to fetch her.<br> - There's no Mrs Fitzpatrick here.<br> - I know she's here! I know it.<br> Where is that serpent-toothed siren?!<br> Who's here, girl? Tell me, and I'll make<br> you the richest poor woman in the nation.<br> There's only a gentleman - Mr Jones.<br> - No lady?<br> - He has a Mrs Waters with him.<br> Waters! I'll bet she's usin' a false name!<br> That cunning wench! By the waters<br> of the Babylon I shall lay me down...<br> I'll bet she's lying down beside Mr Jones!<br> Show me her room!<br> Now where is she?<br> Where is that painted Delilah?!<br> - Down the end there.<br> - Mrs Fitzpatrick!<br> - Come on, Mrs Fitzpatrick!<br> - My husband!<br> - Your husband?!<br> - Do you think I don't know his voice?<br> Discovered, you whore!<br> Aaargh! Rape! Murder! Rape!<br> - What is it, lassie?<br> - A rape's going on down there!<br> Rape?!<br> Rape! Murder! Murder!<br> What is all this?!<br> Mr MacLachlan, dear friend!<br> I rejoice to see you here.<br> - This villain has debauched my wife!<br> - Your wife? What wife?<br> Do I not know Mrs Fitzpatrick very well?<br> And can I not see that the lady in bed with<br> this gentleman is not your wife at all?!<br> Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape!<br> Girl, what's this hullabaloo?<br> 'Tis Tom Jones, madam,<br> in bed with Mrs Waters<br> and discovered by her husband -<br> an Irish gentleman, madam.<br> Forgive me - did you say Tom Jones?<br> Yes, madam - in bed<br> with that trull Mrs Waters.<br> Betrayed!<br> Ma'am, pray forgive<br> my dastardly intrusion. I...<br> What the devil is this disturbance?<br> I thought myself in a respectable inn,<br> but I see now it's a bawdyhouse!<br> I have made a mistake.<br> I was looking for me wife.<br> These villains burst into me room!<br> I heartily ask your pardon, ma'am.<br> I thought you was me wife.<br> Though I see no reason for a gentleman<br> to be in a lady's bed in his shirt.<br> I heard her screams<br> and ran in from the adjoining chamber.<br> Adjoining chamber!<br> It seems I have prevented<br> the lady being robbed.<br> - Robbed!<br> - Robbed? I'll have your blood for that!<br> - You wild Irishman!<br> - Rape!<br> Come on, Sophie, dear. We must fly<br> before Fitzpatrick discovers me.<br> Oh, come, pull yourself together, Coz.<br> We've got a long ride ahead of us.<br> Help!<br> Sophie...<br> Ah, got you, you fox!<br> Well, the vixen can't be far away!<br> Goodbye, madam.<br> I regret I must take my leave of you.<br> Odds bodikins! After him!<br> After him! Damnation! After him!<br> - Oh! There he is!<br> - Miss Western!<br> Brother!<br> Don't be dismayed, sir. She will soon<br> be tired and will stop in some inn.<br> - She's bound for London, I'm sure.<br> - Ah, damn the girl.<br> I'm lamenting the loss<br> of such a fine morning for huntin'.<br> It's confounded hard to lose one<br> of the finest scentin' days of the season.<br> Whoa!<br> Ha!<br> - Come on, Miss Slouch!<br> - What are you doing?<br> Oh!<br> Dobson, drive on.<br> Get up, there! Get up!<br> Stand... and deliver!<br> Whoa!<br> - What did you say, sir?<br> - Stand and deliver!<br> Deliver? I am no travelling midwife, sir.<br> Deliver what?<br> Stand...<br> I will not stand for you, sir -<br> no, nor for any man!<br> - Madam...<br> - Don't you point that firearm at me, sir!<br> - Dobson, drive on.<br> - Get up there!<br> It is hard when a woman leaves a man<br> nothing but memories - and a muff.<br> Your money or your life!<br> - I only have one guinea, sir.<br> - Give it here.<br> As a gentleman of the road<br> you cut a poor figure.<br> Be merciful, sir.<br> I didn't mean any harm. Truly I didn't.<br> - No harm?<br> - It isn't loaded.<br> - Nor it is.<br> - I'm not a bandit by profession, sir.<br> Just a poor man down on his luck.<br> Mine, sir, is a sad story.<br> The start of my ruin was 20 years ago.<br> - It was all over one Tom Jones.<br> - What do you mean?<br> At that time I was employed<br> as a barber by a Mr Allworthy.<br> One day he found a baby<br> abandoned in his bed.<br> I was accused of being the father.<br> - Then your name is...<br> - Partridge.<br> Father!<br> But I do assure you, sir,<br> there was no truth in the accusation.<br> - Then who was my father?<br> - None of us ever discovered.<br> That was the whole beginning<br> of my downfall.<br> Mr Partridge, how can I make up for<br> the suffering you've had on my account?<br> Would you take me on<br> as your servant, sir?<br> - My companion in misfortune!<br> - Oh, sir!<br> Are lodgings cheap in London?<br> I have no money.<br> I know an old lady who runs<br> a lodging house in London.<br> She was Mr Allworthy's cook<br> when I was his barber.<br> No friend of Mr Allworthy's<br> will speak to me.<br> Mrs Miller is one<br> of the kindest ladies I know.<br> Who knows? She may<br> get you back in his favour.<br> Here, you're a lovely boy.<br> Are you going to stay?<br> Good day.<br> No. No, thank you.<br> Desperate to find his Sophie,<br> Tom called on Mrs Fitzpatrick,<br> who was entertaining a certain Lady<br> Bellaston - the notorious Lady Bellaston.<br> It's the handsome young gentleman again,<br> madam, inquiring for Miss Western.<br> You see, Bella, how persistent he is.<br> His servant discovered this address,<br> and ever since he persecutes us.<br> Send him away, Abigail.<br> Tell him Miss Western is no longer here.<br> Bella, you must let Sophie<br> come and stay with you.<br> My protector is coming back, and I fear he<br> may take too much interest in my cousin.<br> Oh, Harriet, you can always rely on me.<br> Your little maid is obviously in the right.<br> He's a very pretty fellow. No wonder<br> so many women are fond of him.<br> Harriet, we must do<br> what we can for Sophie.<br> The girl is obviously intoxicated, and<br> nothing less than ruin will content her.<br> I'm absolutely certain Sophie<br> was at Mrs Fitzpatrick's when I called.<br> Dear Mrs Miller, what am I to do?<br> No friends, no money,<br> I know nothing of London...<br> You're not to worry about the money.<br> You can stay here for the moment.<br> You're very kind, Mrs Miller.<br> For you, Tom. It's just arrived.<br> I wonder, what can it be?<br> What is it?<br> It's an invitation to a masked ball.<br> "The Queen of the Fairies sends you this.<br> Treat her favours not amiss. "<br> It's Mrs Fitzpatrick, perhaps,<br> with news of my Sophie.<br> Or Miss Sophie herself.<br> Vauxhall Gardens,<br> where people come to see and to be seen.<br> In heaps they run, some to undo<br> and some to be undone.<br> It's no fun for a man like me<br> to be dolled up in this damned fruppery!<br> All folks of fashion are here.<br> Sophie will be no exception.<br> Show her to me<br> and I'll have her arrested!<br> Arrested! Do you imagine<br> a woman of stature<br> can be arrested in a civilised nation?<br> A pretty civilised nation indeed,<br> where women are above the law!<br> Civilisation, my trunk!<br> Je vous mprise de tout mon coeur.<br> Now, where can my niece be?<br> If you engage any longer with that trollop<br> I shall tell Miss Western.<br> - Is Sophie here, then, madam?<br> - Upon my honour, she is not here.<br> Mrs Fitzpatrick - if you are she - it's a little<br> cruel to divert yourself at my expense.<br> And do you imagine, good sir,<br> I have no better regard for my cousin<br> than to assist her in carrying on<br> an affair between you two...<br> which must end in her ruin?<br> Madam, that is the last thing I would wish.<br> If the Queen of the Fairies<br> had so little regard for you and Sophie,<br> she would not have appointed<br> to meet you here.<br> Confess honestly:<br> Are you used, Mr Jones,<br> to make these sudden conquests?<br> I am used, madam, to submit.<br> If you take my heart by surprise,<br> the rest of my body has the right to follow.<br> I hope you won't follow me.<br> I protest I shall not know<br> what to say if you do.<br> Free chair, sir. Free chair.<br> You must be a pauper if you can't<br> go in a chair. Or a miser!<br> I thought you were Mrs Fitzpatrick.<br> Fitzpatrick...<br> Sir, I am unfamiliar<br> with customs in the country,<br> but in town it is considered impolite<br> to keep a lady waiting.<br> With our usual good breeding, we will not<br> follow this particular conversation further,<br> but attend results on the following day.<br> Our hero released from Lady Bellaston<br> a torrent of affection -<br> as well as a flood of gifts,<br> which he found suitably embarrassing<br> and quite irresistible.<br> - We must have you looking your best.<br> - Lady Bellaston...<br> Isn't that what Miss Western would want?<br> Come back precisely at four.<br> I shall have news for you then.<br> - Send the bill to me, sir.<br> - Yes, milady. Very good, milady.<br> Good day, milady.<br> How could Tom know that Sophie was<br> now staying here with Lady Bellaston?<br> And being besieged<br> by a certain Lord Fellamar,<br> a gentleman with an eye for any beauty -<br> especially when a fortune was attached.<br> I do beg you to excuse the play.<br> But when may I see you again?<br> Forgive me, my lord.<br> I'm afraid my plans for remaining<br> in London are still a little uncertain.<br> Good day, my lord.<br> Aaah... Aaah...<br> Oh, my la... Sophie!<br> Tom!<br> I see, Sophie,<br> you're somewhat surprised.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I came to look for you.<br> I found your pocket book at Upton<br> and came to ask if I might return it.<br> - How dare you mention that place to me?!<br> - Oh, Sophie, let me ask your pardon.<br> My pardon?! After what I heard at the inn?<br> You cannot despise me<br> more than I do myself.<br> I thought, Miss Western,<br> you were at the play.<br> The play caused so violent an uproar,<br> I got frightened and came home.<br> Where I found this gentleman.<br> He has apparently found the pocket book<br> I told your ladyship I had lost<br> and wishes to return it.<br> And when I do so, all I ask is that I might<br> have the honour of presenting it in person.<br> I presume, sir, you are a gentleman,<br> and my doors are never shut<br> to people of fashion.<br> Thank you, madam. Ladies.<br> Your cane, sir.<br> Oh.<br> A handsome fellow. I don't remember<br> ever to have seen his face before.<br> Nor I neither, madam.<br> I suspected it was Mr Jones himself.<br> - Did your ladyship indeed?<br> - Yes.<br> I can't imagine<br> what put the idea into my head,<br> for, to give this fellow his due,<br> he was very well dressed.<br> I think, dear Sophie, that is<br> not often the case with your friend.<br> I thought your ladyship<br> had said he was handsome.<br> - Whom, pray?<br> - Mr Jones.<br> I meant, of course,<br> the gentleman who was with us just now.<br> Oh, Sophie, Sophie...<br> This Mr Jones, I fear,<br> still runs in your head.<br> I assure you, madam,<br> Mr Jones means no more to me<br> than the gentleman who has just left us.<br> Forgive me teasing you.<br> I promise...<br> I'll never mention his name again.<br> Take this to Lord Fellamar<br> and beg him to attend me tomorrow.<br> She is the only daughter<br> of a country booby squire.<br> At the playhouse she blazed like a star.<br> The first moment I saw her,<br> I loved her to distraction.<br> Her father's estate<br> is a good Pounds. 3,000 a year.<br> Then, madam, I think it<br> the best match in all England.<br> Then, if you like her, my lord,<br> you shall have her.<br> Honor!<br> A letter from my mistress.<br> - Upstairs?<br> - Honor!<br> - In here.<br> - I told my mistress she should...<br> Get behind that curtain<br> and don't speak! Shh!<br> - My dear, charming Lady Bellaston.<br> - Dear? Charming?<br> You've been avoiding me.<br> I should scold you.<br> But I don't think I intend to.<br> - Shh! There is a lady...<br> - A lady? One of your ladies, I suppose.<br> - Where is she?<br> - Uh-uh-uh-uh...<br> There is a lady in the next room...<br> a- dying, madam.<br> What scheme have you and Sophie<br> been plotting behind my back?<br> - Madam, I don't understand.<br> - Answer me one question:<br> Have you not betrayed my honour to her?<br> Am I neglected,<br> slighted for a country girl,<br> for an idiot?<br> Neglected, madam?<br> "I charge you not to think of visiting<br> again", Sophie desperately wrote to Tom.<br> "The truth will certainly be discovered. "<br> "Something favourable<br> perhaps may happen. "<br> "Until then, we must be patient. "<br> Courage, mon vieux.<br> Lord Fellamar is one of the most<br> gallant young fellows about town.<br> Make love to you, indeed!<br> I only wish he would.<br> You would be mad to refuse him.<br> Then I shall most certainly be mad.<br> Entrez.<br> Madam. Miss Western<br> is hardly encouraging.<br> My dear lord, you certainly need a cordial.<br> Fie upon it. Have more resolution.<br> Are you frightened by the word "rape"?<br> All women love a man of spirit.<br> Remember the story of the Sabine ladies.<br> I believe they made tolerably<br> good wives afterwards.<br> Come this evening at nine.<br> I will see she is alone.<br> Oh, I am so entangled with this woman<br> that I don't know how to extricate myself.<br> - I know. Propose marriage to her.<br> - To Lady Bellaston?!<br> Aye. Propose marriage to her<br> and she'll call it off in a moment.<br> You've not a penny, and she'll think<br> you're marrying her for her wealth.<br> It's very convincing for a man<br> in your desperate situation.<br> But what if she took me at my word?<br> Then I'm caught in my own trap.<br> I promise you she won't.<br> She'll be the one to break it off.<br> - Lord Fellamar.<br> - Miss Western, it is I.<br> - I fear I break in upon you abruptly.<br> - Indeed, my lord, I am a little surprised.<br> Love... Love has deprived me<br> of all reason.<br> My lord, I neither understand<br> your words nor your behaviour.<br> You're the most adorable,<br> most divine creature.<br> I do assure you, my lord,<br> I shall not wait to hear any more.<br> If I were master of the world,<br> I would lay it at your feet!<br> My lord, I beg you to stop.<br> Let go my hand.<br> I will never see you again.<br> Then, madam, we must make<br> the best use of this moment.<br> What do you mean?<br> I have no fear but of losing you, madam!<br> Where is she?<br> Damn me if I won't unkennel her now!<br> Aaagh!<br> Oh, Father!<br> - Your father?<br> - Yes. And who in hell are you?<br> I, sir, am Lord Fellamar,<br> the happy man whom I hope<br> you will accept as your son-in-law.<br> You're a son of a whore,<br> for all your fancy falderals!<br> - I resent your tone, sir.<br> - Resent, me arse!<br> I'll teach you to father-in-law me!<br> Ooh!<br> Father, put me down!<br> Put me down, Father!<br> "Dearest madam,"<br> Tom had carefully written,<br> "I am extremely concerned for fear<br> your reputation should be exposed. "<br> "There is only one way to secure it -<br> that you bestow on me the legal right<br> to call you mine for ever. Thomas Jones. "<br> I shall not receive<br> Mr Jones if he calls here again.<br> In London, love and scandal are<br> considered the best sweeteners of tea.<br> I do not doubt that my niece will welcome<br> the favours of a man like Lord Fellamar.<br> This Blifil is a hideous kind of fellow.<br> But, as you know, Bell,<br> all country gentlemen are.<br> I don't then wonder at Sophie's<br> infatuation for this Jones creature.<br> He's an agreeable fellow to look at.<br> Miss Western, will you believe me<br> when I tell you<br> that he has the audacity<br> to make love to me?<br> Oh, these men!<br> I would've torn the eyes out of a prince if<br> he had attempted such freedoms with me!<br> Indeed, he's even gone so far<br> as to propose marriage to me.<br> With your leave, Bell,<br> I will show this to my niece.<br> Apply it to what purpose you may please.<br> - It's from my Sophie.<br> - Good.<br> "Sir, " she wrote, "my aunt<br> has just now shown me a letter<br> from you to Lady Bellaston which<br> contains a proposal of marriage. "<br> "All I desire is that your name<br> may never more be mentioned<br> to your obliged humble servant,<br> Sophie Western. "<br> You could try Mrs Fitzpatrick.<br> She might be able to help.<br> 'Tis said that hope is a bad supper,<br> but makes a good breakfast,<br> and in the morning Tom set off<br> for Mrs Fitzpatrick to seek help.<br> Not a moment too soon,<br> for who should arrive<br> but his old benefactor, Squire Allworthy.<br> Mr Allworthy!<br> What an unexpected pleasure.<br> - Good morning, Mrs Miller.<br> - You are come to forgive him.<br> - Forgive who, Mrs Miller?<br> - Dear Mr Jones.<br> Mr Jones, here, madam?<br> No, I've come to bring<br> my nephew Mr Blifil to London.<br> She must be a most contemptible woman<br> who can overlook merits such as yours.<br> An old acquaintance arrives.<br> I swear that dirty whore's had it now!<br> You wait till I get me hands on her!<br> Let us meet tomorrow. We will find<br> a way of easing your predicament.<br> Oh...<br> Yes, tomorrow.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh!<br> I'm very sorry...<br> My dear sir, I hope no ill blood<br> remains between us.<br> Sir, I don't remember your name.<br> Nor I yours, but I remember your face<br> from the inn at Upton.<br> - Upton... Then your name is Tom Jones?<br> - Indeed it is, sir.<br> Then you have been with me wife after all!<br> Well, that's for you, you rascal!<br> And if you don't give me satisfaction<br> for that blow, I'll give you another!<br> Fight, damn you!<br> Aargh!<br> - I'm sorry, but you drew this on yourself.<br> - Liar! You set on him to rob him!<br> I was coming out of the house...<br> Only to defend myself! He drew his sword!<br> Step back there. What's this all about?<br> Yes - for armed robbery.<br> - You're certain the bastard will hang?<br> - No doubt of it.<br> I hired these two to follow Master Jones -<br> which they did with rare zeal.<br> Good. See that they're properly<br> taken care of, will you?<br> I will break the news to my uncle.<br> Mr Jones has one of<br> the kindest hearts I know.<br> He never mentions your name<br> but to praise it.<br> Uncle...<br> I am afraid to tell you what has happened.<br> It may shock you too much.<br> What's the matter, Nephew?<br> Your adopted son, sir - Jones -<br> has proved himself<br> one of the greatest villains on earth.<br> If anyone else called him a villain<br> I'd throw this tea in his face.<br> Mrs Miller.<br> I know he's not without faults,<br> but they're those of wildness and youth,<br> and I am sure many of us have worse.<br> At least we're not footpads, Mrs Miller.<br> What do you mean?<br> Mr Jones has attacked a man.<br> He has been sentenced<br> to be hanged at Tyburn.<br> Nobody can save him now.<br> If he swing by the string<br> He will hear the bell ring<br> And then there's an end to poor Tommy<br> He must hang by the noose,<br> For no hand will cut loose<br> The rope from the neck of poor Tommy<br> If he swing...<br> If he swing...<br> And Tom was to swing -<br> his enemies had determined on that.<br> So Lawyer Dowling decided<br> to pay a call on Mr Fitzpatrick,<br> and who should receive him<br> but Mrs Waters.<br> Strictly confidential.<br> I come from a most worthy gentleman,<br> whose name at the moment<br> I am not at liberty to divulge.<br> What does this mysterious gentleman<br> want of me?<br> He wants you to help him<br> see that justice is done.<br> To make sure that Jones<br> gets his just deserts.<br> For any assistance you can give him<br> he is prepared to pay handsomely.<br> He is? You interest me, sir.<br> What is the proposition?<br> Meanwhile, faithful Partridge<br> searched for anyone<br> who could prove Tom's innocence<br> of the charge against him.<br> Constable...<br> Constable, have you seen<br> a man with a big scar on his cheek?<br> No, can't say as I 'ave.<br> But all the rogues in the district<br> haunt that tavern yonder.<br> Will you accompany me?<br> I don't go searching for trouble, friend.<br> It's easy enough to come by.<br> Excuse me... Are you the two gentlemen<br> that saw the fight with Mr Jones?<br> Tom cannot escape the gallows<br> unless you retract your evidence.<br> I beg you to do so. And in the meantime,<br> I assure you, you will be rewarded.<br> Hark ye, sir, everything we said was true!<br> Now if I were you, I'd be off,<br> or you're gonna be the worse for it!<br> Only one hope was left now,<br> poor Partridge thought - Fitzpatrick.<br> Now that's better.<br> You'll be all right in a minute.<br> Come in.<br> Sorry for the intrusion, Mrs Fitzpatrick.<br> Well, if it isn't Mr Partridge!<br> Jenny Jones!<br> - But I'm Mrs Waters now.<br> - Whatever are you doing here?<br> I'm a close friend of Mr Fitzpatrick.<br> I'm looking after him.<br> Well, indeed, I came to see Mr Fitzpatrick<br> to plead for your son.<br> - My son?!<br> - Your son, Tom Jones.<br> He never intended<br> to wound Mr Fitzpatrick.<br> But I met the man who wounded<br> Mr Fitzpatrick, at Upton.<br> Then that is the same man -<br> your son, Tom Jones.<br> With his own mother?!<br> - With Jenny Jones?!<br> - How could either have known, sir?<br> Good heavens,<br> in what miserable distresses<br> do vice and imprudence involve men!<br> Ma'am, there's a Mrs Waters here<br> to see Mr Allworthy.<br> - What is she doing here?!<br> - The very woman herself, sir.<br> - You probably don't recognise me, sir.<br> - Indeed you are much changed.<br> But what business<br> can you have with me now?<br> Such business as I can impart<br> only to you, sir.<br> Pray leave us.<br> This, sir, is the very man<br> I was telling you about!<br> - But he is my steward.<br> - Nevertheless, this is the man.<br> - Do you know this lady?<br> - That lady, sir?<br> Mr Dowling, if you value my favour,<br> you will not hesitate, but answer truly.<br> - Do you know this lady?<br> - I have seen her, sir.<br> Before my sister died,<br> did she give you a letter for me, sir?<br> Come with me, sir.<br> Partridge, have my coach<br> brought round at once!<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Uncle...<br> - Before I return, you'd best find the letter<br> which your mother gave<br> to Dowling here before she died!<br> Ah, good day, neighbour.<br> Are you going to see your bastard hang?<br> On the contrary, Mr Western,<br> we're going to Newgate jail to save him.<br> Save him? Save him for what?<br> And this what Mr Allworthy<br> is saying to Mr Western:<br> My friend Mr Fitzpatrick<br> has now recovered<br> and is no longer<br> charging Tom with robbery.<br> I'm as pleased as if<br> he were me own son -<br> which, it may surprise you<br> to know, he's not.<br> Mr Allworthy's own sister Bridget<br> was Tom's mother,<br> and I the one who put the baby<br> in the squire's bed.<br> And that is what it says in the letter.<br> And so Tom is now my only heir!<br> Your heir? Did you say your heir?<br> Yes, neighbour. To Newgate, Goody,<br> and drive for dear life!<br> But I always loved that boy best!<br> He shall have my Sophie by the hand!<br> Tyburn, here I come!<br> Come on, Miss Slouch! Come on!<br> And another old acquaintance<br> has arrived,<br> not only reinstated in the army,<br> but now in charge of the condemned.<br> On your life, Goody, faster!<br> Turnkey!<br> I have come to release a Mr Tom Jones.<br> We sent him off hours ago.<br> He'll be strung up by now.<br> - But they can't hang him!<br> - I have procured this pardon for him!<br> - They can't hang an innocent man!<br> - They have done often enough before.<br> They won't have reached Tyburn yet.<br> We must stop them. Come.<br> If he swing by the string<br> He will hear the bell ring<br> And then there's an end to poor Tommy<br> Faster, faster, Goody!<br> Better luck in the next world, Mr Jones.<br> To die for a cause is a common evil.<br> To die for nonsense is the devil.<br> And 'twould be the devil's own nonsense<br> to leave Tom Jones without a rescuer.<br> Aargh!<br> Oh, my dear boy! Forgive me!<br> Forgive you?<br> How can I ever make amends for those<br> unjust suspicions I've held of you?<br> - You have always used me kindly.<br> - No, Nephew. I have used you cruelly.<br> - Nephew?<br> - Yes.<br> You are indeed illegitimate,<br> but your mother was not this lady here,<br> but my sister Bridget.<br> - Uncle!<br> - It is true, Tom.<br> Ah, this is no time for explanations!<br> Tom, thou art as hearty a cock<br> as any in the kingdom.<br> Go on, after your mistress.<br> Alas, I fear I've sinned against her<br> for all time. I doubt if she'll speak to me.<br> No, Tom, don't say you've lost her yet.<br> Go to her now.<br> - Go on, Tom,<br> - Go to her.<br> Go on, lad.<br> I will!<br> Ah, go to her, lad! To her!<br> Hark ye, Allworthy, I'll bet thee<br> a thousand pounds to a crown<br> we'll have a boy tomorrow nine months.<br> Happy the man and happy he alone,<br> he who can call today his own,<br> he who, secure within,<br> can say "Tomorrow, do thy worst,<br> for I have lived today.
