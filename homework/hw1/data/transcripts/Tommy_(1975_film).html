Rikard Swan was killed two months ago.<br> Rikard's brother, here and Bobby Mitic.<br> Mam-mam;<br> Tommy took the money.<br> If they're his ashes, they'll come after her. Estelle's not just the girlfriend.<br> She knows exactly what went down at Landvetter, and afterwards.<br> Go! Faster, Bobby!<br> Welcome back. How'd that feel? Impressive...<br> - Have some champagne. - Did you doubt me?<br> 'FEE! awesome.<br> [HERA<br> - Sure... -What?<br> Ma.<br> Just heard from the cops. She's back.<br> Do Wave a beard'?

God damn it...<br> HIGH<br> Depends on the mood you're going for.

You went to Rio, to China...<br> That you had all this plastic surgery.<br> Come on.<br> What the hell?

Promise me, Steve.<br> I'll talk to her. It'll be fine.<br> The whole city is talking about Tommy returning.<br> - His wife went to Cabrera yesterday. - No kidding?<br> Nice. It's payback time.<br> Blanca?<br> Do I need to feed you like you're a baby? Jeez...<br> Oh... Hello, Claudia!<br> Estelle! Look at you... I heard you were back.<br> - Good to see you. - And you. I heard you bought a house.<br> Yes, in Appelviken. You must come for dinner.<br> - Hi. - Hi.<br> - How about ice cream? In the kitchen... - I'll go and keep them in line.<br> It was so nice to see you. Let's have lunch.

Oh my.<br> I heard Tommy's coming home.<br> So, now they'll take it to the streets again. You stay away from that, right?<br> - I don't get mixed up in business. - Good.<br> Don't do anything stupid. If anything happens, come to me.<br> You know that. I'm always here.<br> - My star. - Thanks, Steve.<br> - Cheers. - Cheers.<br> - Tell Tommy to get in touch with me. - Of course.<br> That's my wife's new stuff.<br> Completely<br> Christ...<br> Cute, isn't it? Twenty five thousand.<br> - Hands off! - It's going back.<br> - Are you crazy? - Steve called me.<br> - Is he footing the bills? - Cool it.

Or maybe Isabel should do it?<br> Mummy wants you to come home now.<br> Me too.<br> And Blanca...<br> Please!<br> Okay...<br> Guess what? I got to hold Frank's leash myself.<br> Who are you talking to?<br> Nobody.<br> - Try blowing on him now. - He's embarrassed...<br> Christ, what now?<br> Tommy called.<br> - What? -Yeah...<br> Isabel talked to him.<br> Are you trying to be funny?<br> What? No.<br> - What are you talking about? - Isabel spoke to him on the phone.<br> She really misses him.<br> Right... I'm a bad mother.<br> - What? - That's what you're saying, isn't it?<br> She tries to be just like you.<br> She's going to be something else.<br> He's really taken care of me.<br> HEW?<br> Say that you're the only one who really understands him?<br> How did you know? He's a Scorpio.<br> It's like we're meant for each other.<br> They look like gifts at first.<br> Then all of a sudden, he's signing over his debts to you.<br> And if you get pregnant, you're stuck forever.<br> I was sixteen when I met Tommy. You're twenty-five.<br> Yes, but you don't know him.<br> You do know he paid for Rikard's funeral, don't you?<br> He sold out his best friends.<br> They got away with four million Euros.<br> Landvetter<br> I told Tommy beforehand. It's too much money, it's...<br> People get greed?'-<br> He wouldn't listen.<br> Rikard was to give me Tommy's share. But Rikard gets murdered.<br> And suddenly, Bobby is king of the whole city.<br> He tricked us.<br> That includes you.<br> What's Tommy going to do?<br> We're leaving this fucking country.<br> The refrigerator market in Asia has exploded. Everyone wants one...<br> ...so we'll open a kitchen appliance store.<br> In a few years, we can sell it for at least three times more.<br> - That's Tommy's brilliant scheme? - I'll be "Mrs. Fridge".<br> - So you guys are leaving again? - I'm not leaving you.<br> Come with us.<br> You'll see, the people are fantastic. Their hearts are...<br> a completely<br> - Tommy wants you to come too. - Did he say that?<br> So we can be a family again.<br> Bobby...<br> So, how do we solve this?<br> I've got to talk to Tommy.<br> - You want to speak to Tommy? - I need guarantees.<br> Straight from Tommy.<br> What, you'll go for a coffee?<br> I'm going to speak to Tommy.<br> Then let's call him right now. I'm sure he'll understand.<br> Wait...<br> - You know him. - I love him.<br> He asked me to pick up the money.<br> We're like brothers, you know?<br> I can't help you if I don't get the money.<br> - Estelle, I didn't take the money. - Come on...<br> - I can't pay. - Do you really want to do this?<br> No. But that's the way it is.<br> When you took off, the pigs went absolutely nuts.<br> So you think he split with the money too?<br> Like I'd ever say that, Estelle.<br> Anybody who says that I did, is a liar.<br> He wants his stuff now.<br> - Is it since the heist? -Yes.<br> They all disappeared. So did the money.<br> But now, if Tommy's coming...<br> Hello. Kady, right? Look at you, all grown up!<br> - You got shoes on indoors, moron? -Yeah.<br> - Go write love poems instead. - Gonna make me?<br> - Watch it! Do you do the cleaning? - Yes, I do.<br> - I don't have time for this. - Drop dead.<br> - Show some respect. I have a guest. - Like I care?<br> 985 grams. I haven't touched any of it. Let Tommy know that.<br> The stuff can't come out before he gets home. Bobby would go berserk.<br> - Hello, Estelle. - Hello, Ergon.<br> Wow. Where does this come from?<br> I don't know, I just do what Tommy tells me.<br> - It's a first stab at Bobby. - So, when's he coming home?<br> Shit!<br> Estelle!<br> Put your seat belt on. Please.<br> We've been tapping your mother's phone for a few days.<br> When is he coming?<br> Can I go now? I have to get home to my daughter.<br> Estelle, shouldn't she have started school last fall?<br> It will be in the news tomorrow that Tommy's dead.<br> Mammalian<br> Jesus, do you have to smoke in here?<br> [HEMP<br> If anything happens to me, then you take care of her.<br> I'll be back in a few hours.<br> Don't answer the phone. Don't go out, don't open the door.<br> Nothing's going to happen.<br> Just don't go out.<br> AIRPORT ROBBER DEAD<br> ls everything okay?<br> Of course.<br> I saw this really sick thing on Facebook the other day.<br> A handicapped girl begging for money on the streets of New York.<br> The camera followed her, but she didn't know it.<br> They filmed for a few days. And every clay after work...<br> ...she'd get on the bus, get off a few blocks later and go change.<br> She'd be healthy and good-looking.<br> Go to nice restaurants.<br> AURA.<br> What a whore... Tricking people out of money.<br> When is Tommy coming home?<br> The papers say that he's dead.<br> But that's exactly how we want it.<br> Tommy is fucking crazy.<br> No! No!<br> Let go! Let go! Oh, god.<br> You think I can't read? Huh?<br> You think I'm stupid? You're trying to turn Bobby against me!<br> - Cokie... He's coming home. - Shut up. You, of all people!<br> - He's alive, okay? - Say hi to Tommy.<br> - No! - Give me back my coke.<br> All of it. Or we'll be back. I'm not your bitch, got it?<br> Who did this?<br> My little star... who was it?<br> The papers say Tommy is dead.<br> - He's alive. - Talk to me.<br> He's still down there. I came to see Mum and Blanca.<br> Why did they take you out into the woods?<br> - I don't know. - Oh, yes you do.<br> - If they think they can attack you... - I don't want you to do anything.<br> Thanks, Steve.<br> Blanca?<br> - He's home. -You think?<br> This has to stop. Find Estelle.<br> - Why don't you just talk to Tommy? - I don't know where he is.<br> Find her. They get the money now.<br> - What? - Okay...<br> So what the hell are you doing?<br> Are you going sailing?<br> WWW-w<br> I asked for one simple thing, Blanca: Don't leave the apartment.<br> You were gone for two days. Have you seen the papers?<br> It's not true.<br> Honey, we're going to Grandma's. Go pack up your things, and hurry.<br> - They blew up Cabrera. - Okay...<br> "Okay"? Didn't you hear me? They blew up Cabrera!<br> - You weren't supposed to talk to him. - I didn't!<br> - That's great... - I dumped him for your sake!<br> Do you know that he loves me?<br> Here's the thing: you're one of the girls he fucks besides his wife.<br> Stop thinking with your cunt.<br> - What did you say? - Are you hard of hearing?<br> Where the hell do you get off saying that?<br> Listen... If we don't leave in two days, we won't get out of the country.<br> - Whose fault is that? - Mine!<br> - Yes, yours! - Happy? You're so immature.<br> Immature? Why are you always ruining everything? You're so fucking cold!<br> - Come on! - No, I'm not going on your stupid trip!<br> Do you hear me? You're just like Mum!<br> Take off your clothes.<br> Wait!<br> Now you're going to tell me what the hell is going on here.<br> I went to see Cokie. Know what he said?<br> Do you know what Cokie's last words were?<br> - What do you mean? - That Estelle screwed you over.<br> Tommy sent her. It was Tommy.<br> I have something for you.<br> Go play, hone?-<br> What are these ashes they're writing about?<br> So you can read?<br> Bobby didn't take the money.<br> How do you know that?<br> Rikard gave me something. Something for Tommy.<br> Wild?<br> Ask Tommy.<br> My brother is dead.<br> Whoever killed him will pay for it.<br> William... Come on, we're going now.<br> You're not just someone's girl anymore, Estelle.<br> You've started a fucking war.<br> Honey, come here.<br> The money from Landvetter. ls it still around?<br> I don't know. I swear, I don't know.<br> Here we go...<br> - There's just one left. - Save it for tomorrow.<br> I think you should call Steve.<br> He just wants to help you.<br> Hey... Sweetie...<br> Here. It's Christmas.<br> It's Christmas!<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Listen...<br> We need to borrow some money.<br> Just until Tommy gets here...<br> Sure... That's fantastic weed. Great weed.<br> Isabel...<br> Come here. Come on.<br> Don't be shy now. Come here.<br> I think you should look under the tree. In the bag under the tree.<br> Go and have a look.<br> - What do we say? - Thank you.<br> Right. Come here. Come and sit here.<br> Did you talk to Daddy?<br> How's he doing?<br> He'll be home soon.<br> Scoot, so I can...<br> There. What a nice game.<br> Want to take a look?<br> Yes? Sure.

Bye...<br> - She left the kid with Blanca. - So go pick them up.<br> - She's not at home. - Give them to me.<br> - She wouldn't say where they were. - Just do what I tell you to do.<br> But she doesn't have anything to do with this.<br> - Are you sure Tommy is dead? - Just do what I tell you to do.<br> Here you go. Bobby's money.<br> Seven hundred thousand Euros. Transfer it all to Sri Lanka.<br> Tommy won't forget this.<br> - Hello? - How are you guys doing?<br> - She's asleep. - Blanca, listen to me.<br> Catch a cab on the street.

After she's checked in at the airport.<br> You know, I could skin you right now.<br> Or send some guys to the airport to pick up the girls. Now tell me.<br> You can do whatever you want to me.<br> But touch them, and you'll never find out.<br> My star...<br> Hey...<br> You were going to sacrifice yourself.<br> I didn't expect that from you.<br> WWW<br> - Honey, it's Mummy.
