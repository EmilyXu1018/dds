                        That's right.<br> Come on. No, don't stop.<br> Keep looking!<br> You don't feel so good now, do you?<br> See, you let it out. Out!<br> I feel like an idiot.<br> Not so fast, not so fast. Slower.<br> Slower.<br> Good, good.<br> Keep it specific.<br> Still a little tension in the mouth.<br> Good, good.<br> Okay, make her work peripherally.<br> Michael...<br> ...Dorsey, is it?<br> Yes, that's right.<br> Mr. Dorsey, would you turn<br> to page 23, please?<br> Yes, I believe you mean<br> the first scene...<br> Sorry, the second scene<br> of the first act.<br> Second scene of the first act. Right.<br> Begin when you're ready.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Oh, sweetheart, do you know what<br> it was like waking up in Paris...<br> ...seeing the empty pillow where...<br> Wait! Cover your breasts. Kevin is<br> downstairs! My God, what are you?<br> I'm a woman. Not Felicia's mother.<br> Not Kevin's wife.<br> Thanks very much.<br> We need someone a little older.<br> Mom! Dad! Uncle Pete, come quick!<br> Something's wrong with Biscuit!<br> I think he's dead!<br> We're looking for someone younger.<br> "They have dinner..." Can I start again?<br> I didn't get kicked off right.<br> The reading was fine.<br> You're the wrong height.<br> I can be taller.<br> No. We're looking<br> for somebody shorter.<br> Look. I don't have to be this tall.<br> See, I'm wearing lifts.<br> I can be shorter.<br> I know, but we're looking<br> for somebody different.<br> I can be different.<br> We're looking for somebody else.<br> What do you care more<br> about than working?<br> The part's the most important thing.<br> But love sometimes is too.<br> With improvisation, you're the writer.<br> When somebody writes a play...<br> ...they decide where the highs are,<br> where the lows are. Now you do it.<br> And you may not be high where<br> they're high in the writing.<br> You may not be low where they're low.<br> You may be high on "but."<br> You may be high on "and."<br> Of course, they were doing it<br> for dough...<br> ...the same as everybody<br> does it for dough.<br> But the question is in<br> the last analysis.<br> What were they doing for dough?<br> You and me were advancing our<br> little non-Prussian careers.<br> So when all hell broke loose,<br> and the Germans ran out of soap...<br> ...and figured, "What the hell?<br> Let's cook up Mrs. Greenwald!"...<br> ...who the hell do you<br> think stopped them?<br> Pardon me, is my acting<br> interfering with your talking?<br> Don't play a part that's not in you.<br> Don't say "he" or "she" like you did<br> last week when you were doing Kitty.<br> When you were doing<br> Time Of Your Life.<br> If you can't make the part yourself,<br> you can't play it.<br> Sergeant.<br> Quick! Get a priest!<br> No, sergeant, no priest.<br> - But you're dying, Count Tolstoy.<br> - I know.<br> In the name of the Father,<br> the Son and the Holy Ghost...<br> ...I commit your soul to God.<br> - My friends...<br> - That's super, Michael.<br> But I wonder if you could move center<br> stage on that speech, and then die.<br> Why?<br> The left side of the house<br> can't see you.<br> You want me to stand up and walk<br> to the center of the stage...<br> ...while I'm dying?<br> I know it's awkward,<br> but we'll just have to do it.<br> - Why?<br> - I just told you. Now do it!<br> Because you say so?<br> Yes, love.<br> Not with me as Tolstoy.<br> You gotta work.<br> There's no excuse for not working.<br> There's no excuse.<br> There's unemployment.<br> There was unemployment when<br> my friends and I started acting.<br> And it's not changed.<br> You got 90-95% unemployment.<br> It's never going to change.<br> You're an actor.<br> You're in New York.<br> There is no work.<br> But you gotta find ways to work.<br> Two tortellinis,<br> a gazpacho with two salads.<br> Ordering: Veal chop, medium,<br> two scrods, an order of chicken!<br> One scrod underdone.<br> - What's the rest?<br> - Baked potato.<br> - How'd it go?<br> - Terrible.<br> - Did you rewrite the last scene?<br> - I did the necktie scene.<br> How is it?<br> It'll change theatre as we know it.<br> We'll work on it<br> when we get home tonight.<br> That's my flounder.<br> - That is my flounder.<br> - Robber!<br> - Ordering: One flounder...<br> - That's for the customer!<br> I eat these things so if the<br> customers ask if I eat his food...<br> ...I can say, "Yeah, I eat his food."<br> You rewrote the necktie scene? Good.<br> - Without the necktie?<br> - With the necktie.<br> - With the necktie?<br> - Yeah, with the necktie.<br> The necktie's wrong. You take the<br> necktie out, you got something.<br> - What's wrong with you?<br> - What's wrong with me?<br> What's wrong is it's depressing<br> to be disagreed with.<br> It's depression.<br> Today's your birthday,<br> and you haven't mentioned it.<br> Don't start. I'm a character actor.<br> Age has no effect on me.<br> - That's very good.<br> - How does one not be depressed?<br> Instead of trying to be Michael Dorsey,<br> the great actor or the great waiter...<br> ...why not just try to be<br> Michael Dorsey?<br> I am Michael Dorsey.<br> What's the payoff?<br> - Say it like you mean it.<br> - I am Michael Dorsey. Fine. Okay?<br> Surprise!<br> Speech! Speech! Speech!<br> Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute.<br> First a toast.<br> To Michael Dorsey, who makes you<br> remember what acting's all about!<br> Being unemployed!<br> To Michael...<br> ...who's been my friend for six years.<br> Was it that long?<br> And who is my coach.<br> And he's just great.<br> He's a great coach, a great actor.<br> He's a great guy and...<br> This is a really dumb speech.<br> Let's get drunk.<br> Happy birthday!<br> - How you doing? Michael.<br> - Patty.<br> You an actress? Terrific face.<br> Nice blouse. Who'd you come with?<br> I don't want a full house<br> at the Winter Garden Theatre.<br> I want 90 people who just came out<br> of the worst rainstorm in history.<br> These are people who are alive<br> on the planet...<br> ...until they dry off.<br> I wish I had a theatre that<br> was only open when it rained.<br> Strasberg said you create<br> your opportunities.<br> - Uta said that.<br> - I don't care.<br> The point is, Sandy and I are raising<br> $8,000 to do Jeff's play in Syracuse.<br> We're going to do it.<br> You could do the same.<br> Look at Emily!<br> Look who's here.<br> You can do it in the Poconos.<br> You're sitting around saying,<br> "I can't work." Create your own...<br> Isn't she cute?<br> He loves children.<br> He really does.<br> You make it!<br> You find a way to raise it.<br> I was looking at you.<br> Terrific face. Are you an actress?<br> - Sometimes.<br> - You were in Dames At Sea!<br> - You saw that?<br> - Good work. Really!<br> You have a great singing voice.<br> I felt there was an aura<br> between us when I saw it.<br> I'm not kidding.<br> I don't know you, but I know you.<br> I'll tell you about yourself.<br> You like to run barefoot on the beach.<br> - Why are you so wired?<br> - It's my birthday. I'm out of work.<br> That's it? Nothing more?<br> Yeah, it hurts me. Be the last one<br> to take your coat tonight. We'll talk.<br> Fine. All right.<br> Will you? Serious?<br> Give me a hug.<br> Thank you for liking me.<br> I don't like it when people say...<br> ..."I really dug your message, man."<br> Or, "I really dug your play, man.<br> I cried."<br> You know?<br> I like it when people come up to me...<br> ...the next day...<br> ...or a week later and they say...<br> ..."I saw your play.<br> What happened?"<br> I've got it under control. I'll feed<br> my cats and be back in an hour.<br> I can't make it. My roommate<br> wants to work on the third act.<br> - You can't make it?<br> - He wants to work.<br> - Give me your phone number.<br> - I already did.<br> - I thought you changed it.<br> - Since an hour ago?<br> Good point.<br> Let me talk to him. I'll call you.<br> - Didn't anybody hear me?<br> - Guess not.<br> I've been trapped for half an hour.<br> What kind of a party is this?<br> God, you guys are having<br> a good time, huh?<br> Sorry.<br> I'll remember that if I ever<br> do a scene where I'm trapped.<br> - It's nice, Michael.<br> - Thanks.<br> Who is that?<br> - Mallory. She's married to John.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I did a thing about suicides<br> of the American Indian.<br> And nobody cared. Nobody showed.<br> And I think the American Indian<br> is as American...<br> ...as John and Ethel Barrymore...<br> ...and Donny and Marie Osmond.<br> I think it's really sad...<br> ...but I think that, nowadays,<br> when people dream...<br> ...they don't even dream in their<br> own country anymore.<br> And that's sick.<br> I had a good time.<br> I just didn't know half the people.<br> It was late, and I wanted it<br> to be a surprise.<br> I invited 10 people.<br> They all invited 10 people.<br> You met 40 new people.<br> They all liked you.<br> I heard nice things about you.<br> - Thanks, Jeff.<br> - Good night.<br> - Happy birthday.<br> - Thank you.<br> - One of the five people I knew.<br> - Great party.<br> Thank you.<br> Excuse me, Miss Right?<br> Miss Right?<br> Good night.<br> It was a wonderful party.<br> My date left with someone else.<br> I had fun. Do you have any Seconal?<br> Come on, I'll take you home.<br> I did have a good time.<br> I really did.<br> You didn't.<br> Wait. Money for cab fare.<br> That's okay. It's cheaper to<br> get mugged. Let's walk.<br> The fares are really<br> insane now anyway.<br> - Why didn't you have a good time?<br> - I did have a good time.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - Nothing's wrong.<br> What?<br> - What?<br> - Nothing! I'm perfectly fine.<br> I just cry like this, like a tic.<br> Tell me what's wrong,<br> or I'll kill you.<br> Nothing's wrong, Michael.<br> I'm really very up.<br> You're worried about your audition.<br> Why?<br> - Because I'm not going to get it.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because I'm completely wrong for it.<br> - What kind of a part is it?<br> A woman!<br> You don't have a man,<br> so you act like one.<br> You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.<br> I'm proud of being a woman.<br> Wait a minute.<br> This guy treats you like dirt...<br> ...because he's a big doctor, right?<br> But don't take that.<br> Talk to him on his level.<br> Show me.<br> You're doing a Southern accent?<br> You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.<br> I'm very proud of being a woman!<br> I can't do it as good as you.<br> You can! Just turn the tables<br> on him. Come on, now.<br> You're wrong.<br> I'm proud of being a woman.<br> Where am I off?<br> - I don't know what you're playing.<br> - I'm playing rage. I'm enraged.<br> You told me to turn the tables.<br> I'm playing rage.<br> This is rage?<br> I have a problem with anger.<br> You do. But there's 100 other<br> actresses reading...<br> ...who don't, who aren't<br> afraid of working.<br> Who aren't afraid to stick<br> everything on the line and do it!<br> - Don't get mad!<br> - Stop being a doormat!<br> - I'm not a doormat!<br> - Act right now! Do it!<br> You're wrong, Dr. Brewster. I am...<br> Go on.<br> - You're wrong, Dr. Brewster...<br> - Must I hit you with a stick?<br> You're wrong.<br> I am very proud to be a woman.<br> And I'm proud of this hospital.<br> And before I see it destroyed<br> by your petty tyrannies...<br> Have the anger. Don't show it to me.<br> ...I'll recommend you be<br> thrown out into the street.<br> - Don't lose it.<br> - Good day.<br> - Don't whine like you're second-rate.<br> - I said good day!<br> Not bad.<br> Did you feel how much I hated you?<br> - You really felt it?<br> - That's why I'm going.<br> How can I get it back tomorrow?<br> How can a total stranger enrage me?<br> I'll pick you up at 10:00<br> and enrage you.<br> Bruce Fortune to Telecine.<br> Bruce Fortune to Telecine.<br> - Bennett?<br> - Right here.<br> Stanz?<br> I'm supposed to look like this?<br> - That is what you look like.<br> - It's not funny.<br> Good.<br> Don't lose that.<br> No sequins, Alfred.<br> She's attending her husband's funeral.<br> Jacqui?

A tomato<br> doesn't have logic. It can't move!<br> So if he can't move,<br> how's he going to sit down?<br> I was a stand-up tomato.<br> A juicy, sexy, beefsteak tomato!<br> Nobody does vegetables like me!<br> I did vegetables off-Broadway!<br> I did the best tomato,<br> the best cucumber!<br> I did an endive salad that knocked<br> the critics on their ass!<br> I'm trying to stay calm here.<br> You are a wonderful actor.<br> Thank you.<br> But you're too much trouble.<br> Get some therapy.<br> Okay, thanks. I'm gonna raise<br> $8,000 to do Jeff's play.<br> Michael, you're not<br> gonna raise 25 cents.<br> No one will hire you.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Dorothy Michaels?<br> - Yes.<br> - George Fields is your agent?<br> - Yes.<br> - Okay, ladies.<br> Please bring your pages<br> and follow me.<br> I hate this line,<br> "You have every right to happiness."<br> This is Dorothy Michaels.<br> Our director, Ron Carlysle.<br> That's our producer, Rita Marshall.<br> George Fields is Dorothy's agent.<br> That's impressive.<br> I'm afraid you're not right for<br> this role. Thanks for coming by.<br> Page 205, you want camera one or two?<br> - Camera two, and tell Art.<br> - Why am I not right?<br> I'm trying to make<br> a certain statement...<br> ...and I'm looking for<br> a specific physical type.<br> Mr. Carlysle, I'm a character actress.<br> I can play it any way you want.<br> I'm sure you're a very good actress.<br> It's just that you're not<br> threatening enough.<br> Not threatening enough?<br> Take your hands off me or<br> I'll knee you in the balls!<br> - Is that enough of a threat?<br> - It's a start.<br> I think I know what you want.<br> You want a caricature of a woman.<br> To prove some point like<br> power makes a woman masculine...<br> ...or masculine women are ugly.<br> Well, shame on any woman<br> that lets you do that.<br> And that means you, Miss Marshall.<br> Shame on you, you macho shithead.<br> Jesus!<br> What is idiotic about power<br> making a woman masculine?<br> Not that that was my point.<br> Miss Michaels, just a minute.<br> Was that for real<br> or were you auditioning?<br> Which answer will get me<br> a reading, Miss Marshall?<br> Well, good for you.<br> Come.<br> - Miss Michaels.<br> - Yes. Oh, thank you.<br> You really think she's worth testing?<br> She told me no director had ever<br> communicated a part to her so fast.<br> She said that?<br> I like her...<br> ...accent.<br> - I gotta get these back in order.<br> - They won't know the difference.<br> I'm a little nervous.<br> Just think of them<br> as something friendly.<br> Like a firing squad.<br> Miss Michaels, we're going to<br> do a camera test now.<br> Let me have a right profile, camera 1.<br> Camera 3, a left profile.<br> What side?<br> Left side.<br> Which way for your left?<br> - What?<br> - Is that my left or your left?<br> Wait. What are you talking about?<br> My left.<br> Your left.<br> Miss Michaels, nobody's talking to you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought you wanted my profile.<br> - Not so close on camera 3.<br> - Camera 3, back off.<br> Make her look a little more attractive.<br> How far can you pull back?<br> - How do you feel about Cleveland?<br> - Knock it off.<br> That's good right there, Herbie.<br> Dorothy, honey, we're going<br> to try one. Okay?<br> Let me see exactly<br> what you showed us a while ago.<br> Cue her, Jo.<br> "I know the kind of woman<br> you are, Emily.<br> You're getting older. You don't have<br> a man, so you want to act like one."<br> Shut your mouth right now. When you<br> talk to me, talk professionally.<br> You don't get personal.<br> That is inappropriate behavior.<br> I'm proud of being a woman,<br> Dr. Brewster.<br> I'm proud of this hospital,<br> and you should be too.<br> And I must tell you, before I let it<br> be destroyed by your petty tyrannies...<br> ...by your callous inhumanities, sir...<br> ...I'm going to recommend<br> you be turned out into the street.<br> Good day, Dr. Brewster.<br> I said good day, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> Hold it a minute.<br> Tough cookie.<br> I gave her that direction.<br> Something more, though.<br> I don't know. It's your decision,<br> but something about her bothers me.<br> I like it.<br> We'll send the contracts to George.<br> Excuse me. Could you help me?<br> I'm looking for the Russian Tea Room.<br> This is the Russian Tea Room.<br> You're in front of it.<br> Oh, well, my stars! So it is.<br> Well, this is very embarrassing.<br> Yeah, well, this is it.<br> Thanks very much.<br> Good afternoon, Mr. Fields.<br> Nice to see you. Please sit down.<br> - The waiter will be just a minute.<br> - George, how are you?<br> Hey, Ronnie. How are you?<br> - Hi.<br> - Wait a minute...<br> I'm new in town, and I'm lonely.<br> Would you buy me lunch?<br> You can't come...<br> Gregory, this woman...<br> Don't. It's okay.<br> George. George. George.<br> It's Michael Dorsey, okay?<br> Your favorite client. How are you?<br> Last job you got me was a tomato.<br> - Oh, no, no, no...<br> - Yeah.<br> - Swear to God.<br> - Michael?<br> Oh, God! I begged you to get therapy.<br> - You also said no one would hire me.<br> - And this'll make a difference?<br> I got a soap.<br> I'm the new woman administrator on<br> Southwest General.<br> Congratulate me! They thought<br> I almost looked too feminine.<br> - Something from the bar?<br> - A double vodka right away, please.<br> For the lady?<br> How about a Dubonnet with a twist?<br> - Thank you. Lovely blouse.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Welcome.<br> - You won't get away with this.<br> - I got away with it. Look around.<br> - I don't believe this.<br> I mean, I just don't<br> believe anybody else will.<br> - You want to bet?<br> - Don't sit...<br> - You know Joel Spector.<br> - Hello, Joel. How are you?<br> I talked to Stuart yesterday.<br> He'll be one more week in London.<br> Then he definitely...<br> - I missed you!<br> - Then he definitely...<br> You're such a tickly-wickly. You<br> never were before. We go back years.<br> - We haven't been introduced.<br> - Joel Spector.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Phil Weintraub.<br> - Sorry. This is Michael...<br> - Dorothy Michaels. Nice to meet you.<br> May I say that you are<br> the best director...<br> - Producer.<br> - Sorry. Producer...<br> ...on the Broadway scene today.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, Miss Michaels.<br> - Hope to see you again.<br> - Let's have lunch.<br> - Fine.<br> - Call you.<br> He's handsome.<br> You should represent him.<br> - You are psychotic!<br> - No, I'm employed.<br> - I got the whole world...<br> - Don't!<br> - I won't make fun of you.<br> - Don't get close to me!<br> - Loan me $1000 till payday.<br> - For what?<br> For what? I gotta have something<br> to wear besides this.<br> I won't let you not buy it.<br> It's the best dress you've had on.<br> I think it makes me look dumpy.<br> Because you're wearing ankle straps.<br> With a few alterations...<br> Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!<br> Thank you, thank you.<br> What are you doing?<br> I was here first!<br> Thank you.<br> Those women were like animals.<br> I saw this beautiful handbag.<br> I was afraid to fight for it.<br> They're vicious. They kill their own.<br> The woman that finally bought<br> this handbag, I know did time.<br> Now I don't have a decent handbag.<br> You know what this lingerie cost?<br> And the makeup?<br> How does a woman keep herself<br> attractive and not starve?<br> Can I have more cottage cheese?<br> - You wore this today?<br> - I gotta set that before I go to bed.<br> Easy, easy, easy.<br> Please!<br> I'm dieting. Please.<br> I gotta get up at 4:30,<br> do a close shave.<br> I told the studio I do my own makeup<br> because I'm allergic.<br> I appreciate your doing this,<br> but it's for the money, isn't it?<br> It's not so you can wear<br> these little outfits?<br> I'm not even gonna answer that.<br> It's a great acting challenge.<br> You know what my problem is?<br> Cramps.<br> No, not cramps.<br> Sandy.<br> How can I tell her they cast a man<br> instead of her? She'll be suicidal.<br> Don't tell her.<br> Where will I say I got the money?<br> What am I going to do? Tell her<br> somebody died and left it to me?<br> - My God! When did she die?<br> - Last week.<br> Of what?<br> A disease.<br> Gee, what a coincidence.<br> I mean, your needing $8000 and<br> her leaving you exactly that much.<br> - Isn't it?<br> - It's, well...<br> - All right, kid.<br> - It's mine?<br> - Learn your lines.<br> - I'm excited!<br> This is the greatest part!<br> I want to take you to dinner.<br> It's time we celebrated something.<br> - To Return to the Love Canal.<br> - Hurry up.<br> - I'll jump in the shower.<br> - Hurry, hurry, hurry!<br> Why, yes.<br> You know, we can stay here<br> if you want to, and...<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Oh, God! I'm...<br> Sandy, I want you.<br> You want me?<br> I want you.<br> I want you.<br> - Will I ever see you again?<br> - We've known each other six years.<br> I know. But sex changes things.<br> I've had relationships where I<br> know a guy, then have sex with him...<br> ...and then I bump into him and<br> he acts like I loaned him money.<br> That's not me.<br> I'll call you tomorrow.<br> I know there's pain in every<br> relationship. I just want my pain now.<br> Otherwise, I'll wait by the phone...<br> ...and then I'll have pain<br> and wait by the phone.<br> It's a waste of time.<br> Let's make it definite.<br> Dinner tomorrow.<br> Mom?<br> What do you think?<br> Hurry. I'm late.<br> Turn around.<br> Smile.<br> - Say something.<br> - Hello. It's nice to meet you.<br> You look very nice. Nice.<br> But the hair's not right.<br> You got a Howard Johnson's thing going.<br> Do something. I can't be late<br> my first day. Come on.<br> - Easy, easy!<br> - It's not your head.<br> - Okay?<br> - Let's see.<br> Well, it works.<br> But what?<br> Don't play hard to get.<br> Taxi! Taxi!<br> Taxi!<br> - Dorothy Michaels. Southwest General.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> TV 2.<br> Straight ahead, first right.<br> Is that clock right?<br> - Yes.<br> - I couldn't get a cab.<br> Hi, Bobby. This is Miss Michaels.<br> You'll be in Room 4. We'll need you<br> on set in about 15 minutes.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - That's ok...<br> - Oh, Jesus.<br> - It's quite all right.<br> - I'm April Paige.<br> - My, what a nice-looking table.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes, it's very smooth.<br> And that's a very good idea.<br> A socket for a plug.<br> - Yeah, well, we got everything.<br> - Yes, I see.<br> Just push all that out of the way.<br> Make yourself at home.<br> Yes?<br> One more thing, Miss Michaels.<br> I forgot to give you these.<br> Oh, are these for today?<br> They always throw stuff<br> at you in the last minute.<br> - My goodness!<br> - What's wrong?<br> - I have to kiss Dr. Brewster!<br> - He kisses all the women.<br> We call him "The Tongue."<br> Okay, quickly. Now, the tubes<br> have pulled out of Rick's nose.<br> Julie, there's an alert<br> at your station.<br> Rick, get on the floor.<br> That's why the tubes pulled out.<br> When Julie starts stuffing<br> the tubes back up your nose...<br> ...you grab her hard.<br> - In his condition?<br> Yes. He's been crazy<br> since he fell through the ice.<br> You're delirious.<br> You think she's Anthea.<br> - Mr. Carlysle, I...<br> - Jesus Christ!<br> Could I have<br> a little more hammering here?!<br> Now, when you grab her,<br> maybe you even say, "Anthea! Anthea!"<br> Good. Is my violin somewhere<br> in the room?<br> Your violin sunk.<br> It's at the bottom of the lake.<br> The violin fell through the ice.<br> He was playing during the thaw.<br> You're Dorothy Michaels, aren't you?<br> I'm John Van Horn.<br> We're up next.<br> When he grabs you,<br> you've got to be torn, to struggle.<br> You know you've got to get those<br> tubes stuck back up his nose.<br> But you also realize<br> you're in the arms of a man...<br> ...whose music was everything to Anthea.<br> It was her whole life.<br> This is a man who stood by you<br> after Ted's breakdown.<br> Get me a bagel and cream cheese.<br> - Julie, you want anything?<br> - No. She's fine, thanks.<br> So it's a struggle, but you're<br> struggling with yourself as well.<br> - And I lose, right?<br> - Get down here a minute.<br> Now, then, Rick, it says when she<br> comes down to her knees...<br> ...it inflames your desire.<br> God knows, it inflames mine.<br> Okay, Big John.<br> Dorothy, come in here.<br> This is Dorothy Michaels,<br> the new hospital administrator.<br> Hello, Dorothy.<br> Hi! We met the other day.<br> Julie Nichols, hospital slut.<br> No! Now, Mr. Carlysle...<br> I'm sorry, but we have so little time,<br> we can't even rehearse.<br> I'm gonna show you your marks,<br> and then we'll go straight to tape.<br> Big John, you'll enter from here,<br> you see them struggling...<br> ...you cross to here and cry loudly,<br> "Nurse Charles! Are you insane?"<br> Yes, I see. Will it be<br> on the teleprompter? "Loudly?"<br> And who do I say that to?<br> Nurse Charles.<br> I thought when Dr. Brewster...<br> You will enter from here,<br> cross to this mark.<br> I know my mark.<br> But I thought...<br> The corridor scene will be played<br> right here. Right?<br> See, I just wanted to ask<br> concerning the doctor...<br> Places, please.<br> Stand by, tape is rolling.<br> Five, four, three...<br> Anthea!<br> Oh, Anthea!<br> Freeze up.<br> One twenty-five.<br> Nurse Charles! Are you insane?<br> I'm Emily Kimberly,<br> the new hospital administrator.<br> Nurse Charles, what on earth<br> is going on here, dear?<br> Help me get her to her feet,<br> Miss Kimberly.<br> John's going.<br> Nurse Charles, tend to your patient<br> and faint on your own time!<br> - Yes, Miss...<br> - Kimberly.<br> Dr. Brewster...<br> ...you and I must talk.<br> - Rita, you want to keep rolling?<br> - It's okay. The girl saved it.<br> - You haven't changed, Emily.<br> - But I have, Medford.<br> You know, Emily, there's no reason<br> for us to be in opposite camps.<br> We can rule Southwest General together.<br> I admire people with power.<br> Women with power, especially.<br> God, she hit him on the head.<br> Rita, she hit him.<br> - and not consider it a threat?<br> I'm afraid that you have<br> underestimated me.<br> If you want to win me over,<br> you'll deal with my mind...<br> ...and not my lips.<br> - Cut it.<br> - And stop tape.<br> - I was supposed to kiss her.<br> - It was just an instinct.<br> Remember what you said about<br> being more threatening?<br> It was a good instinct.<br> It would've been mine.<br> Wait. I'll handle the instincts here.<br> It happened to be a good<br> instinct, toots.<br> But next time you want to change<br> something, discuss it with me first.<br> Yes. I was wrong not to.<br> Good girl.<br> Big John, wonderful!<br> All right, people.<br> Item seven. In the corridor.<br> Thanks for catching me.<br> You saved my ass. Literally.<br> Dorothy...<br> ...I just want to say I loved what you<br> did in our scene. Welcome aboard!<br> Well, you know, you were good too...<br> Can I have your autograph?<br> I've always watched the show.<br> You're so great.<br> Wonderful! Oh, thank you!<br> Thank you. That was an<br> exhilarating first day.<br> - Tell me about it next week.<br> - Good night.<br> Julie, come on, baby.<br> Can we drop you?<br> Maybe you'd like to join us for a drink.<br> - No, thanks. I feel like walking.<br> - Okay, bye.<br> She's a very attractive girl.<br> And no dummy.<br> But for the life of me...<br> ...I cannot understand why she<br> hangs around with that director.<br> He treats her like she's just...<br> ...nothing!<br> I think you're right.<br> I'm rewriting the necktie scene<br> without the necktie.<br> He's condescending.<br> He calls me "sweetheart."<br> He doesn't even know my name.<br> He calls her "baby."<br> He pushed me around. If not for<br> the dress, I'd have kicked his ass.<br> How'd you communicate with him?<br> He told me what he wanted.<br> I didn't say anything.<br> I did it my way. He bawled me out.<br> I apologized. That was that.<br> I think Dorothy's smarter than I am.<br> I just wish I looked prettier.<br> I look in the mirror and...<br> Maybe I can just get a softer...<br> ...hair or something,<br> because she deserves it.<br> - Don't answer that!<br> - Why not?<br> - It could be for Dorothy. Please.<br> - Why'd you give them this number?<br> The show has to contact me<br> in case they change the schedule.<br> I'll find out.<br> They can't think Dorothy lives<br> with a man! It's wrong for her.<br> It could be for me.<br> Answer as Dorothy.<br> I can't!<br> What if it's Sandy?<br> If it's Diane, how do I<br> explain there's a woman here?<br> I'll get a service tomorrow.<br> When you were playing Cyrano and you<br> stuck a saber in my armpit...<br> ...I didn't say anything.<br> When you were hopping around,<br> ranting about your hump...<br> ...saying this was a bell tower,<br> I didn't say anything.<br> But I don't see why I should<br> pretend I'm not home...<br> ...just because you're not<br> that kind of girl.<br> That's weird.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To Diane's.<br> That way if anybody wants to reach me,<br> they can talk to me.<br> What do you think I'm doing this for?<br> For you, for the play, for Sandy...<br> I told you to give me<br> the pain yesterday.<br> Sandy, I'm sorry.<br> I can't talk long.<br> I just don't have the energy.<br> I didn't forget.<br> I just may have the flu.<br> Do you have a fever?<br> How much? Go right to bed<br> and take two aspirin...<br> ...bundle up, sweat, and drink liquids.<br> Above all, take 1000 units of<br> vitamin C every hour with milk only.<br> Did you give Melanie<br> an overdose on purpose?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't write the shit, you know.<br> Don't be so hard on Dr. Brewster.<br> He's insecure.<br> I have to be tough.<br> He just wants my body.<br> Dorothy, you're so bad.<br> - You look just the way you look.<br> - Thank you. You're very attractive too.<br> I want you to meet my dad, Les.<br> - It's nice to meet you.<br> - I feel I know you already.<br> I just love your daughter to pieces.<br> I can't write any clearer<br> than I can write. It's in English.<br> - What about those?<br> - For Sandy?<br> For me, for Dorothy. Not exactly,<br> but that kind of idea.<br> - A little overstated.<br> - Really? Wait a minute!<br> Jesus!<br> - That's her.<br> - Mr. Earl!<br> You got it.<br> Thursday, what time?<br> I will not forget.<br> Okay, bye-bye.<br> "Things are better since you<br> came to Southwest General."<br> - "We're so grateful to you."<br> - For?<br> - "For your help and advice."<br> - "I think of you all as my daughters."<br> "What kind of mother wouldn't<br> give her girls tits?"<br> "Tips."<br> It's "tips."<br> Tips.<br> You'll find you picked<br> the wrong man to challenge.<br> It was you who pro...<br> Look at me when I talk to you.<br> I don't trust a man<br> who won't meet my eye.<br> I don't trust it in a bank teller<br> or a salesman.<br> And I certainly don't trust it<br> in a chief surgeon.<br> You provoked this confrontation.<br> You're an incredibly<br> insensitive woman.<br> Stop thinking of me as a woman<br> and start thinking of me as a person.<br> That's what Southwest General<br> is made of, people.<br> And have Nurse Charles<br> see me immediately.<br> - Push in for a close-up.<br> - Not too close!<br> Okay, hold it there.<br> - And cut it!<br> - Stop tape.<br> Dorothy, it was wonderful<br> the way you held my face.<br> You controlled me completely.<br> Thank you, but you had<br> some great moments.<br> Hold it. Good news, children.<br> Our brilliant engineers have<br> again erased a reel of the show.<br> So we have to retape<br> It's either that<br> or do it live, tomorrow.<br> I think we should tape it.<br> That's a wrap. See you bright<br> and early, 6:30 tomorrow.<br> - Good night, Dorothy.<br> - Good night, Ben.<br> That's some day, huh?<br> What? Oh, you mean about<br> doing it over again.<br> Tell me, does that happen often?<br> Every once in a while.<br> We actually had to do it live once.<br> Live!<br> You should have seen Van Horn's face.<br> He was so panicked...<br> ...we had to shoot him from the back.<br> - Want some wine?<br> - No, thanks. I better go home.<br> I have to wash my hair.<br> Thanks anyway.<br> - Dorothy?<br> - Yes?<br> Listen, I know this is exactly<br> what you want to hear now...<br> ...but we've got 26 pages,<br> and I was wondering...<br> ...if you could come over and<br> run some lines with me tonight.<br> I could make you something to eat.<br> Night, Fay.<br> I'm a born defroster.<br> You don't have a thing to wear?<br> - She's seen me in all these.<br> - Not in the white thing.<br> What, this? You cannot wear white<br> to a casual dinner. It's too dressy.<br> - You couldn't wear pants?<br> - No. Pants? I can't.<br> - What about this?<br> - No shoes for it.<br> The lines make me look hippy...<br> ...and it cuts me across the bust.<br> We're getting into a weird area.<br> This is smart.<br> What about this?<br> Looks like you should<br> ring a school bell.<br> This may seem silly to you,<br> but this is our first date.<br> I want to look pretty for her.<br> Hi.<br> What a pretty outfit.<br> - Glad you like it.<br> - Come on in.<br> - Brought you something.<br> - You didn't have to.<br> It wasn't nothing.<br> Come in.<br> I'll put them in water.<br> What a big apartment.<br> - What a lovely, lovely room.<br> - Is it?<br> - Yes, it's yummy.<br> - I had a decorator do it.<br> Before, no money.<br> Now, no time.<br> - Amy is asleep. Finally.<br> - Scared the daylights out of me.<br> Miss Nichols, that child is never<br> going to learn anything if you keep...<br> Thank you, Mrs. Crawley.<br> - Dorothy, Mrs. Crawley.<br> - I'm sorry, I didn't know.<br> Nice meeting you.<br> - Scares the shit out of me.<br> - Scared me to death.<br> Drop your coat here.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Amy's nanny.<br> And she hates me.<br> Who's Amy?<br> My daughter.<br> She was 14 months old last week.<br> I didn't know you had a baby.<br> You got any kids, Dorothy?<br> - Were you ever married?<br> - I haven't been that fortunate.<br> I was engaged once, though,<br> to a brilliant young actor...<br> ...whose career was cut short by<br> the theatrical establishment.<br> - They killed him?<br> - So to speak.<br> Sutton gave up acting, and me as well.<br> He's working now as a waiter<br> in a disreputable restaurant.<br> I don't want to talk about it.<br> Maybe you'd like some wine?<br> No, I think I'd better keep sharp<br> when we work, you know?<br> You mind if I ask you a question?<br> Do you worry about using so much<br> heavy makeup on your skin?<br> I don't worry.<br> I have a little...<br> ...moustache problem I'm sensitive to.<br> Probably just too many<br> male hormones or something.<br> Some men find that attractive.<br> I know, I know. I just don't like<br> the men that find it attractive.<br> So you're divorced?<br> I've never been married.<br> Perhaps I'll have<br> one little drink.<br> Tell me about Ron.<br> - How much time have you got?<br> - Go on.<br> Well, Ron...<br> Ron is, hands down, the best<br> director of daytime drama.<br> Did they tell you<br> not to call it a soap yet?<br> If anybody calls it a soap opera,<br> Rita fines them a quarter.<br> It's how she got her car.<br> You're not telling me<br> about you and Ron.<br> That's nighttime drama.<br> He's interesting there too.<br> Oh, you mean he's...<br> You mean you have a good relationship.<br> What's a good relationship, Dotty?<br> Can I call you Dotty?<br> - Oh, please do.<br> - Ron's smart and he's funny.<br> We got things in common.<br> You know a guy who wants a woman<br> who eats at four...<br> ...is unconscious by nine<br> and works at dawn?<br> But how does he treat you?<br> Oh, that!<br> - You think I do this without a plan?<br> - What do you mean?<br> There are a lot of men out there.<br> I'm selective. I look around carefully.<br> When I find the one who can<br> give me the worst time...<br> ...that's when I make my move.<br> for a Czech movie.<br> Try answering as if the question<br> took you by surprise.<br> What do you mean?<br> I'll ask a question.<br> You just answer it.<br> Why do you drink so much?<br> When you grow up as I did, an orphan<br> raised by a sister 16 years older...<br> ...you have few illusions.<br> - There you go.<br> - It made a difference?<br> You got it.<br> Thanks, Dorothy.<br> Why do you drink so much?<br> Because it's not fattening...<br> ...and it's not good for me.<br> How many things can you say that about?<br> You telling me to mind<br> my own business.<br> I just don't think you<br> should worry about it.<br> - It's nice of you, but...<br> - But I should mind my own business.<br> It's all so complicated, isn't it?<br> - What?<br> - All of it.<br> Don't you find being a woman<br> in the '80s complicated?<br> Extremely.<br> - You know what I wish, just once?<br> - What?<br> That a guy could be honest enough<br> to walk up to me and say...<br> ..."Hey, I'm confused about this too.<br> I could lay a big line on you,<br> we could do lots of role-playing...<br> ...but the simple truth is,<br> I find you very interesting...<br> ...and I'd really like to make love<br> with you." Simple as that.<br> - Wouldn't that be a relief?<br> - Heaven.<br> Sheer heaven.<br> Ron was supposed to come over<br> last night. I had dinner all ready.<br> He never showed up.<br> Oh, my Lord!<br> What time is it?<br> It's 10:30.<br> I gotta go.<br> Listen, forgive me for rushing off.<br> It was a wonderful dinner.<br> The dinner is burned.<br> I'm sorry I'm late.<br> But I was taking a shower...<br> ...and the water turned off...<br> ...and I got soap in my eyes.<br> I had to go to five stores to get<br> chocolate-chocolate chip.<br> Michael, I saw her.<br> What? You saw who?<br> When you were late,<br> I went by your place.<br> I waited outside and I saw that<br> fat woman go into your apartment.<br> Fat woman?<br> The one in the raincoat.<br> Oh, that woman!<br> That's a friend of Jeff's.<br> She came over to help him<br> with the play.<br> They've known each other for years.<br> You think she's fat?<br> Well, it was dark but, yes,<br> I thought she was fat.<br> When did Jeff start<br> collaborating on his play?<br> She's an excellent typist.<br> Look, I'm not having<br> an affair with that woman.<br> It's impossible.<br> I don't want to make trouble.<br> I shouldn't have people over.<br> They never show up.<br> I'm sorry. I feel guilty.<br> You feel guilty. I'm sorry.<br> Don't do that. Don't apologize<br> because I'm three hours late.<br> You should be furious.<br> You've been great to me.<br> You helped me with the audition<br> for that soap. It's that soap!<br> That soap!<br> Did you see that cow they hired?<br> Cow?<br> They must've gone a different way.<br> She is awful.<br> Well, I heard she was pretty good.<br> Baloney!<br> She's supposed to be tough, right?<br> She's not tough.<br> She's a wimp!<br> Maybe it's the lines.<br> She doesn't make them up.<br> Well, I think she should.<br> They couldn't be any worse.<br> I can't move out, Miss Kimberly.<br> I have no place to go.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Don't tell me your husband beats you,<br> but you can't move out.<br> - Why should you move?<br> - What is she saying?<br> Three's up. Ready one.<br> You know what I'd do<br> if somebody did this to me?<br> I'd pick up the biggest thing<br> around and I'd just...<br> ...bash their brains<br> right through...<br> ...the top of their skull before<br> I'd let them beat me up again.<br> Well, I can't afford therapy,<br> Miss Kimberly.<br> Who said anything about therapy?<br> - Cut it, Ron.<br> - Cut it!<br> Wait a minute. Her line is<br> "Your husband..."<br> Wait a second.<br> May I say in my own defense...<br> ...to tell a woman<br> with two children, no money...<br> ...and a husband who beats<br> her up like this...<br> ...to move into a welfare center<br> to get therapy is a lot of...<br> ...horseshit!<br> I wouldn't do it, would you?<br> - I can't act with this.<br> - Oh, shut up.<br> Ron?<br> I'm partially to blame, Miss Kimberly.<br> I know I'm pretty, and I use it.<br> I guess I shouldn't have gone<br> to Dr. Brewster's office so late.<br> No, that's not true.<br> Dr. Brewster has tried to seduce<br> several nurses on this ward...<br> ...claiming to be in the throes<br> of an uncontrollable impulse.<br> Do you know what?<br> I'm going to give every nurse<br> on this floor an electric cattle prod...<br> ...and instruct them to just zap<br> him in his "badubies."<br> Cattle prod?<br> Ruby. Hi, do you want to<br> open up the yellow pages...<br> ...under the section<br> of Farm Equipment...<br> I am Dorothy. Nobody's writing her.<br> It's coming out of me.<br> You're Michael acting Dorothy.<br> It's the same thing.<br> I'm experiencing these feelings.<br> Why can't you get me a special?<br> I feel I have something to say to women.<br> - You have nothing to say to women.<br> - I have plenty to say to women.<br> I've been an unemployed<br> actor for 20 years!<br> I know what it's like to wait<br> for the phone to ring!<br> Then when I finally get a job,<br> I have no control! I got zip!<br> If I could impart that experience<br> to other women...<br> There are no other women<br> like you. You're a man!<br> Yes, I realize that, of course.<br> But I'm also an actress.<br> - We shouldn't argue about this.<br> - I'm a potentially great actress.<br> I could do Medea, Ophelia, Lady Macbeth.<br> Just like in Shakespeare's day.<br> Get the writers at the agency...<br> I could do a great Eleanor Roosevelt.<br> We can do the<br> Eleanor Roosevelt story!<br> The Eleanor Roosevelt story?<br> What's the matter with that?<br> Phil Weintraub's party is Saturday.<br> Let's just go.<br> Have a good time.<br> Don't take yourself so seriously.<br> - He never invited me to a party.<br> - I'm inviting you.<br> He did a fabulous job on your eyes.<br> I can't blink for a week. Really.<br> - I don't like it here.<br> - Stand up straight.<br> - What do you want?<br> - A double champagne.<br> What is this?<br> Just serve yourself?<br> Hi. What would you like?<br> Give me two...<br> - Two what?<br> - Of anything.<br> - I'm sorry...<br> - A couple of champagnes.<br> - Can I get you something?<br> - Vodka on the rocks with a twist.<br> You don't remember me?<br> When I came in, I thought<br> you looked familiar.<br> - What's your name again?<br> - Suzanne.<br> Call Pamela Green, my agent.<br> Paramount's interested.<br> I'll know after the first.<br> I'll read it after the first.<br> Actually, I'm not that crazy<br> about the script.<br> I'm having a rewrite done.<br> Maybe we could have dinner.<br> Call Pamela.<br> She handles me for dinner.<br> Do you have a light?<br> - How've you been?<br> - Great.<br> - Good.<br> - You look wonderful.<br> Silly me, I already had dinner.<br> I didn't know there'd be so much food.<br> It's for my dog.<br> He likes fruit.<br> Mike Dorsey.<br> Great view, huh?<br> Only Phil could afford all those lights.<br> You know...<br> ...I could lay a big line on you...<br> ...and we could do a lot of<br> role-playing, but the simple truth...<br> ...is that I find you<br> very interesting.<br> And I'd like to make love to you.<br> You know?<br> It's as sim...<br> As simple as that.<br> I understand who you really are.<br> And I'll no longer submit to your<br> petty insults and humiliations.<br> It's not necessary now that<br> Emily Kimberly's here.<br> Now that someone who sees<br> the truth is your equal.<br> Listen, doctor, I've filed charges<br> against you with the AMA.<br> You'll be notified tomorrow.<br> - And cut it.<br> - Cut.<br> It's a good one.<br> Perfect.<br> - That was great.<br> - Thanks, John.<br> - Lovely job. First-rate.<br> - You were wonderful.<br> Thanks to my coach.<br> No, you did it yourself.<br> - Was it okay?<br> - I loved the middle...<br> So much for the<br> mutual-admiration society.<br> Let's move on to item 17.<br> Jo, clear this set.<br> I'll need Alan, Tom and John.<br> Tootsie, take 10.<br> Ron?<br> My name is Dorothy.<br> It's not Tootsie or Toots<br> or Sweetie or Honey or Doll.<br> - Oh, Christ.<br> - No, just Dorothy.<br> Alan's always Alan, Tom's always Tom<br> and John's always John.<br> I have a name too. It's Dorothy,<br> capital D-O-R-O-T-H-Y.<br> Dorothy.<br> Excuse me, doctor.<br> Did somebody die?<br> - Violinist.<br> - I didn't know he was that sick.<br> He wasn't.<br> He asked for a raise.<br> I'm sorry about what<br> happened out there.<br> - I was upset.<br> - What're you doing for the holidays?<br> Why?<br> Well, the baby and I are gonna<br> go up to my dad's farm upstate.<br> It's not exactly the fast lane,<br> but it's kind of fun.<br> Maybe you'd like to come along?<br> You know, since my dad met you,<br> he's your biggest fan.<br> Is Ron coming too?<br> Would that make a difference?<br> Actually...<br> ...I think he has to stay<br> in town and work.<br> If it matters...<br> ...I've always hated women who treat<br> other women as stand-ins for men.<br> It's not that, really.<br> I'd just like you to come.<br> I just don't want to get up too soon<br> or I'll have another relapse.<br> Isn't there some way we could rehearse<br> in the same room together?<br> We will. Right after the weekend.<br> I'll call you Monday.<br> Thanks. Bye-bye.<br> You know where my pink nightgown is?<br> With the flow...<br> - Listen to me.<br> - What?<br> Stop packing.<br> Don't do this.<br> - Why?<br> - You should not do this.<br> In two weeks, if I ever see Julie again,<br> it'll be as Michael...<br> ...and she'll probably<br> throw a drink in my face.<br> - How can you keep lying to Sandy?<br> - It's for her own good.<br> I never told Sandy I wouldn't<br> see other women. Come on.<br> If I told her, it would hurt her<br> and I don't want to do that.<br> Especially since Julie and I<br> are just girlfriends.<br> I'm just afraid you'll<br> burn in hell for this.<br> I don't believe in hell.<br> I believe in unemployment.<br> - Wait! Let me get those.<br> - Oh, well, thank you.<br> - Strong little thing, aren't you?<br> - Well, no.<br> Come on, Dorothy.<br> I'll show you the house.<br> - Careful coming up here.<br> - It really is old, isn't it?<br> Here we are.<br> I'll set up the crib in a second.<br> Unpack your bags and we'll...<br> Wait. Are we sharing?<br> The upstairs is shut off.<br> And I know you girls.<br> No matter what, you'll sneak back<br> together and spend the night giggling.<br> He still thinks I'm 12.<br> Which side do you want?<br> I think the one closest<br> to the bathroom.<br> I won't take up much room.<br> Take it between your thumb<br> and forefinger.<br> Let every finger roll down<br> individually. That's it, yes.<br> My goodness.<br> You'll be all right.<br> Special up here, isn't it?<br> I'm glad you came.<br> Can I tell you something?<br> Sweetheart?<br> Ron is on the phone.<br> Hi. I'm sorry.<br> - What, Dorothy?<br> - Nothing.<br> - I think I'll put her down.<br> - Good.<br> Gets a little chilly out here.<br> - No, I was just...<br> - I brought this sweater for you.<br> Thank you.<br> Very nice of you, Les.<br> Thank you.<br> I wonder if we're going to get<br> any stars out of the sky tonight?<br> I've got my stars.<br> You and Julie.<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - I should've transposed it.<br> It's wonderful for a lady<br> to play piano.<br> Quit. Mama insisted.<br> - Who wants another drink?<br> - You better take it easy.<br> - Remember Injun Joe.<br> - What's that?<br> Don't you tell that story.<br> - This bar Daddy hangs out in...<br> - I don't.<br> He and Injun Joe threw back<br> a few too many.<br> Hard liquor.<br> They thought they saw this elk.<br> They stalked it for a couple hours.<br> They cornered it up<br> against Charlie's barn.<br> About the time they were ready<br> to blast it, it mooed.<br> It was a cow?<br> Enough laughing at your old man.<br> You know this one?<br> Wait a minute.<br> - Bravo!<br> - That was Julie's mother's name.<br> Mary Juliet Cooper.<br> Well, I'm going to bed.<br> Do you wanna hit the hay,<br> as they say on the farm?<br> I think I'll... You and...<br> Both of you go to bed.<br> - I'll stay up.<br> - I'll stay with you.<br> Well, I'm going.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, dear.<br> Good night, Dad.<br> Sleep well.<br> Be good.<br> - Nice girl, isn't she?<br> - Very sweet.<br> I'm kind of glad Ron didn't come up.<br> You know I am too, actually.<br> Really?<br> - I'm sorry. Please, sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> I thought you'd be more like<br> one of them "liberators."<br> You know, I'm not really<br> like the woman on the show.<br> I mean, it's just a part.<br> I'm not that militant.<br> Don't get me wrong.<br> I'm all for equality.<br> Women ought to be entitled to<br> everything and all, et cetera.<br> Except...<br> ...sometimes I think<br> what they really want is to be men.<br> Like men are all equal<br> in the first place. We're not.<br> Can I get you another drink?<br> I must keep my wits tonight.<br> Tonight?<br> Well, always.<br> I remember years ago...<br> ...there wasn't talk about<br> what a woman was, what a man was.<br> You just were what you were.<br> Now they have all this stuff about<br> being like the other sex...<br> ...so you can all be the same.<br> Well, I'm sorry, but we're just not.<br> Not on a farm, anyway.<br> Bulls are bulls,<br> and roosters don't try to lay eggs.<br> Never.<br> My wife and I, we were<br> married a lot of years.<br> People got it all wrong.<br> They say your health<br> is the most important thing.<br> But I can lift this house off the<br> ground. What good is it?<br> Being with someone.<br> Sharing.<br> That's what it's all about.<br> - Julie says you're not married.<br> - No.<br> Like another drink?<br> - No.<br> - You sure?<br> Yes. Well, you know what?<br> I think it is about that time.<br> - Thanks for staying up and talking.<br> - Don't you mention it.<br> You have beautiful eyes.<br> Oh, well, thank you.<br> Good night, Les.<br> Daddy's a little out of<br> touch, isn't he?<br> No. Very sweet, very sweet.<br> He sees things pretty simply.<br> You're either happy or unhappy.<br> Married or not married.<br> There's nothing in between.<br> I tried to get him to take out<br> other women after Mama died but...<br> You know, she must have been<br> a very special person.<br> I guess so.<br> I don't remember her very well.<br> I remember her helping me<br> pick out this wallpaper.<br> I'd chosen one with great big,<br> purple flowers on it.<br> And she said to me...<br> ..."Just remember that once<br> you choose it...<br> ...it's gonna cover the walls<br> of your room for a long, long time."<br> So I tried to imagine what those big,<br> purple flowers would look like...<br> ...on all the walls of my room...<br> ...every night when I was<br> falling asleep...<br> ...and every morning<br> when I was getting dressed.<br> So I said to her,<br> "Which one would you choose, Mom?"<br> And she said, "The one with<br> the daisies and the little rosebuds...<br> ...because daisies<br> are such homey flowers...<br> ...and rosebuds are so cheerful<br> and always waiting to bloom."<br> That's lovely.<br> I made a million plans<br> looking at this wallpaper.<br> I was always waiting<br> for these rosebuds to open.<br> That's nice.<br> My mother used to do that too,<br> sometimes.<br> - Good night, Julie.<br> - Good night, Dottie.<br> Cathy Campbell,<br> please call your office.<br> It says "cool."<br> Don't you think I should be angry?<br> Doesn't it play better?<br> Yes. Why don't you try that?<br> This just came to<br> our dressing room for you.<br> - I think it's from Julie's father.<br> - Oh, my!<br> Now don't you dare eat any.<br> You don't want to ruin your cute figure.<br> What a thoughtless present<br> to give a woman.<br> Chocolates!<br> Dorothy Michaels,<br> Rita Marshall's office.<br> You're a complicated lady.<br> On the one hand,<br> you're a real pain in the ass.<br> I've got one of the most<br> expensive directors in soaps...<br> I owe myself a quarter.<br> And you've got him<br> defensive and hostile.<br> I don't mean to.<br> However, we're getting<br> ...and we've picked up<br> three share points.<br> And it's largely due to you.<br> You are the first woman character<br> who is her own person.<br> Who asserts her own personality<br> without robbing someone of theirs.<br> You're a breakthrough lady for us.<br> We're picking up your option for<br> another year. Congratulations.<br> Come on, Mike. What do you mean,<br> get you out of it?<br> There's no way out.<br> It's their option.<br> What? Who gave them that?<br> You signed the standard contract.<br> But I didn't know I'd be working<br> for the rest of my life as a woman!<br> You gotta make it work.<br> They'll pay. They'll go from<br> You get me out of this,<br> or I'll go in and tell them.<br> Tell them what?<br> That you put a network on the spot?<br> You're making a fool out of women?<br> They'll kill you!<br> My secretary wants to be like<br> Dorothy Michaels. I want to fire her.<br> We're talking major fraud here.<br> Major fraud! You can't tell them.<br> What about me? You think anybody<br> will believe I wasn't in on this?<br> It's not just ruining yourself.<br> This is ruining me too.<br> You can't do it.<br> You gotta make it work.<br> - Can you take that many Valium?<br> - We'll see.<br> Maybe your contract has<br> a morals clause.<br> If Dorothy did something filthy or<br> disgusting, they'd let you go.<br> But you've already done everything<br> filthy and disgusting on your show.<br> Dorothy, it's Julie.<br> There's sort of an emergency.<br> Well, it's not really an emergency...<br> ...but if you get a chance,<br> would you call me?<br> - Are you sure you wanna do this?<br> - No, but I'm going to.<br> I've been fooling myself about Ron<br> for too long now.<br> I guess I really wanted you here<br> for moral support.<br> Although I did fire Mrs. Crawley today.<br> I really did.<br> - Want a drink?<br> - I'm not the one breaking up with Ron.<br> I'd buy a ticket to that.<br> You have influenced me though.<br> I've seen Ron through your eyes.<br> Julie, I don't want<br> that responsibility.<br> Why shouldn't you influence me?<br> You wouldn't compromise your<br> feelings like I have...<br> ...or live this kind of lie.<br> Well, no, I wouldn't.<br> But...<br> Of course not. And you're right.<br> It's just...<br> I deserve something better.<br> I don't have to settle for this.<br> But I've always been too lazy<br> or too scared or too something.<br> Don't be so hard on yourself.<br> What the hell?<br> I'll live, won't I?<br> Maybe not happily, but honestly.<br> Sounds like something you'd say.<br> You mustn't idealize me. Honesty,<br> in many ways, is a relative term.<br> My father's coming.<br> If he calls, don't say<br> anything about this.<br> He's coming tonight.<br> He'll want to see you.<br> Me?<br> Oh, God!<br> It's Ron.<br> Oh, Dorothy, God bless you.<br> Wish me luck now.<br> Always.<br> I feel that little moustache.<br> You should put some makeup on it.<br> How're you doing?<br> What's going on?<br> Dorothy's gonna sit with Amy.<br> - I'll be right back.<br> - Okay.<br> Hi, honey.<br> You don't mind if I call you honey<br> when we're not working?<br> Nice dress.<br> Thank you.<br> You don't like me, do you?<br> I can respect that...<br> ...but there's not many women<br> I can't make like me.<br> Why don't you like me?<br> I don't like<br> the way you treat Julie.<br> Oh?<br> I don't like the way you patronize her,<br> deceive her and lie to her.<br> What do you mean?<br> You want me to go on?<br> No, I know what you mean.<br> Look, I never promised Julie I'd be<br> exclusive and not see other women.<br> But I know she doesn't want<br> me to see them...<br> ...so I lie to her<br> to keep from hurting her.<br> That's very convenient.<br> No, wait a minute.<br> Look at it from my side.<br> See, if a woman<br> wants me to seduce her...<br> ...I usually do.<br> But then she pretends I promised her<br> something. Then I pretend I did.<br> In the end, I'm the one<br> that's exploited.<br> Bullshit, Ron!<br> You know what?<br> I understand you a lot better<br> than you think I do.<br> Really?<br> I'm ready.<br> - Julie's ready.<br> - She sure is.<br> Dorothy, she never wakes up.<br> But if she does,<br> there's applesauce in the fridge.<br> Give her a couple spoonfuls.<br> I'm sure she...<br> Are you sure you'll be okay?<br> Don't be silly. How much trouble<br> can a baby be? Go on.<br> It's okay.<br> Oh, it's okay.<br> Oh, please don't cry.<br> Please don't cry.<br> Oh, I love you.<br> Look how much fun we're having.<br> It's all right. It's all right.<br> It's okay.<br> It's Uncle Dorothy.<br> Please don't cry.<br> Please don't cry. Please.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Oh, here's funny clown.<br> Funny clown's talking to...<br> Look.<br> Come on, Amy.<br> Hello, Amy.<br> Amy...<br> Give me a break, will you?<br> Here, come on.<br> Will you eat some more now?<br> You told me to open up this one.<br> Now this is apri...<br> Gotcha! Gotcha!<br> You want a little more apricot?<br> Don't do that anymore.<br> Don't do that to Aunt Dorothy.<br> You'll go to sleep after this.<br> Just try this one,<br> and then I'll put you...<br> I don't like you.<br> It's not funny.<br> Amy, look at this.<br> She'll have to paint the kitchen.<br> Here, look at yourself.<br> You see what a bad girl looks like?<br> Dorothy?<br> I'll be right there.<br> How's Amy? Any trouble?<br> Oh, not at all.<br> She was an angel.<br> Are you all right?<br> Fine.<br> What's the matter?<br> Tell the truth now.<br> Are you sure you're all right?<br> No.<br> Why?<br> Who am I going to have dinner with?<br> Oh, God! I hate myself<br> for being like this.<br> - You know something funny?<br> - What?<br> And I don't want you<br> to take this the wrong way.<br> But since I met you, I'm so grateful<br> to have you as a friend.<br> And yet, at the same time...<br> ...I've never felt lonelier<br> in my whole life.<br> It's as though I want something<br> that I just can't have.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Do you?<br> - Dorothy?<br> - Julie!<br> - My God!<br> - Let me explain.<br> Don't say anything.<br> - There's a reason.<br> - I understand.<br> That's not the reason.<br> I'm not who you think I am.<br> - Just wait a minute.<br> - Nobody is.<br> - It's me.<br> - No, it's me.<br> - No, it's me.<br> - No, it's me.<br> I'm not well-adjusted enough.<br> I'm sure I've got the same impulses.<br> Obviously, I did.<br> Don't jump to conclusions about<br> that impulse.<br> If you could just see me<br> out of these clothes...<br> What? What?<br> That's my father!<br> You've got to tell him.<br> - Tell him.<br> - Tell him what?<br> That I...<br> That's a corncob.<br> Hi, Dad.<br> Fine.<br> I'm here with Dorothy.<br> I can't tonight, Daddy.<br> But wait.<br> You've got to see him.<br> Just don't lead him on.<br> - Please don't make me do this.<br> - You gotta let him down gently.<br> - I can't.<br> - You owe me that.<br> Hi, Les.<br> I'm fine. How are you?<br> Tonight, sure.<br> Tonight?<br> - What'll you have?<br> - Just water.<br> - Water and bourbon.<br> - Make that a straight scotch.<br> Scotch and bourbon.<br> I'd like to...<br> - Let's dance.<br> - What?<br> - It's my favorite dance.<br> - Oh, really, I don't dance.<br> - You'll love it.<br> - What?<br> - Follow me. Follow me.<br> - Please, I don't...<br> You know what? I'd...<br> Really, I'd rather not.<br> - Just relax.<br> - You're very good.<br> - My wife and I took a course.<br> - I could tell at once.<br> - Emily, we love you.<br> - You're fabulous!<br> - Just wonderful.<br> - Wonderful.<br> - You're even prettier in person.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm sorry. I forgot that<br> you're on your feet all day.<br> - Come on, sit down.<br> - Yes, I think we should stop.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> I was happy you could<br> come out tonight.<br> I know you usually<br> got a lot of lines to learn.<br> - There's something I'd better say.<br> - I want to say something too.<br> Wouldn't it be funny<br> if we both said the same thing?<br> It'd be hilarious.<br> But I doubt it.<br> Well, mine's pretty simple.<br> I'm not too good with words anyway.<br> I only took two pictures in my life...<br> ...my high-school graduation<br> and my wedding.<br> My wife stood next to me in both.<br> I never thought I'd want anybody<br> to fill her place.<br> That changed last weekend.<br> - Lester.<br> - Lesley.<br> - Lesley...<br> - Don't interrupt me.<br> I gotta do this in one go<br> or I won't do it.<br> I know this is kind of quick,<br> but that's how I am.<br> Never did believe in<br> not getting down to it.<br> Don't say anything now...<br> I know it's fast.<br> But take time to think about it.<br> If you say no, at least I'll feel<br> you took me seriously.<br> Would you mind?<br> I just need to be alone.<br> I'd like to start thinking it over<br> as soon as possible.<br> Dorothy?<br> This is a nightmare.<br> Don't be angry.<br> I had to talk to you.<br> - How'd you know where I live?<br> - I followed you.<br> - What? Followed me home?<br> - I didn't have the courage to phone you.<br> - Could I come up for a drink?<br> - No, you can't! I have a headache.<br> Please! I'll only take<br> a tiny moment of your time.<br> I'll see you on the set tomorrow<br> and we'll talk about it.<br> Go home.<br> Have you been drinking?<br> Shh! Are you out of your<br> cotton-picking mind?<br> Come on up!<br> I'm on the third floor!<br> Hurry before someone<br> calls the cops!<br> Jesus!<br> Come in, but you can<br> just stay a minute.<br> Can I have a drink?<br> Anything alcoholic will do.<br> - Just one drink and I'll go.<br> - Oh, all right, but I...<br> Nice mirror.<br> Here.<br> What is it that couldn't wait?<br> I'm just an untalented<br> old has-been.<br> Were you ever famous?<br> - No.<br> - Then how can you be a has-been?<br> I love the way you never let me<br> get away with anything.<br> - Dorothy...<br> - Yes?<br> - I want you.<br> - Pardon?<br> - I've never wanted a woman this much!<br> - Please! Perhaps another time.<br> Turn me away, it'll kill me!<br> - I don't want emotional involvement.<br> - I'll take sex.<br> - I don't want to hurt you.<br> - I don't mind.<br> Oh, shit!<br> John Van Horn, Jeff Slater.<br> Jeff Slater, John Van Horn.<br> How do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> - I'll be going.<br> - I think it's best.<br> - Gee, I hope I haven't...<br> - No, I hope I haven't...<br> I want you to know, for the record...<br> ...that nothing happened here tonight.<br> Thank you, John.<br> I'm sorry, Dorothy.<br> I didn't understand.<br> I'm really sorry.<br> Please don't talk about this.<br> My lips are sealed.<br> You slut!<br> Look, don't start in with me.<br> Don't do that.<br> Rape is not a laughing matter.<br> That guy wanted me.<br> You cannot believe<br> the night I have had tonight!<br> - I think I can imagine.<br> - No, you can't.<br> I saw his eyes.<br> I was in trouble.<br> If you don't come in,<br> I'm in the Daily News the next day.<br> How did you ever let him in?<br> What do you mean?<br> He was singing.<br> - Is he that good a singer?<br> - What do you..?<br> That's him!<br> Say I'm in the bedroom crying.<br> Don't let him in!<br> Michael.<br> It's Sandy.<br> Sandy?<br> It's Sandy?<br> I can't let her see me like this.<br> I hear you in there.<br> Open the door. It's me, Sandy.<br> Open the door!<br> - Sandy, is that you?<br> - Yes!<br> What time is it?<br> I fell asleep, I guess.<br> I was having a nightmare<br> and you were in it.<br> Mike's in the shower.<br> I'm in the shower!<br> I got soap in my eyes!<br> I'm not dressed.<br> I was asleep. I was dreaming.<br> You were in my dream.<br> You had big teeth.<br> I had big what?<br> - I gotta get something on.<br> - Are you having a party?<br> I'm in the shower!<br> Turn on the water!<br> It's stuck! I got soap in my eyes<br> and there's no water coming out!<br> I can't come out<br> with soap in my eyes!<br> Open the door!<br> I can hear you in there, you guys.<br> Open the door!<br> - Open this door.<br> - The door was open.<br> You must think I'm really stupid.<br> No one would say it to your face.<br> I've been out there for 10 minutes.<br> It sounded like a party in here.<br> Well, Mike was in the shower.<br> You know.<br> - Hi, I was taking a shower.<br> - He was in the shower.<br> - Good shower?<br> - Good shower.<br> Why haven't you returned<br> my phone calls?<br> I'll go do some writing.<br> Excuse me.<br> Wait, I'll be back.<br> I got a present for you.<br> Pigs!<br> I'm glad you came over.<br> I've been meaning to give this to you.<br> - I suppose this means nothing's wrong?<br> - Nothing is. Is it?<br> I've called you all week<br> and you haven't called back.<br> - You treat me like I'm a jerk.<br> - What?<br> - I called and you didn't call back!<br> - No, it's...<br> My new answering machine is no good.<br> I'll answer my own calls.<br> - I went to six stores for your favorite.<br> - Chocolate-covered cherries?<br> That's sweet.<br> Oh, and a card.<br> Oh, yeah. No, no!<br> Don't, don't read it!<br> I was very angry when I wrote that!<br> "Thank you for the lovely night<br> in front of the fire.<br> Missing you, Les."<br> This isn't for me.<br> It's another girl's candy.<br> I wouldn't give you<br> another girl's candy.<br> - Then, whose is it?<br> - Mine.<br> A guy named Les sends you candy?<br> Yes. He's a friend of mine.<br> He can't eat candy. He's diabetic.<br> Why is he thanking you for<br> a lovely night in front of the fire?<br> My mind's a blank.<br> Are you gay?<br> In what sense?<br> Just be honest with me.<br> For once in your life tell the truth!<br> Because these stories<br> are very demeaning to me.<br> No matter how bad the truth is...<br> ...it doesn't tear you apart inside<br> like dishonesty.<br> At least it leaves you with<br> some self-respect and some dignity.<br> You're right.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.<br> I'm gonna tell you the truth.<br> Sandy...<br> I'm in love with another woman.<br> What are you saying?!<br> - Sandy, please. Don't...<br> - You liar!<br> We never said "I love you."<br> - We went to bed one time.<br> - I don't care.<br> You're a dear friend. But let's not<br> pretend it was something else!<br> We're gonna lose everything!<br> I don't care about "I love you!"<br> I read The Second Sex...<br> ...and The Cinderella Complex!<br> I'm responsible for my own orgasms!<br> I just don't like to be lied to!<br> You asked me<br> to be straight with you.<br> I didn't say<br> how I'd feel about it.<br> - What can I do?<br> - There's nothing you can do for me.<br> I just have to feel like this...<br> ...and you have to know<br> you made me feel this way!<br> - Aren't we still friends?<br> - No!<br> I don't take this shit from friends,<br> only from lovers.<br> - Wait, what about the play?<br> - What about it?<br> I should tell you to shove your play.<br> But I won't, because<br> I never allow personal despair...<br> ...to ruin my<br> professional commitments.<br> I am a professional actress!<br> So, are these real<br> chocolate-covered cherries?<br> I think so.<br> - See you at rehearsal.<br> - Oh, Sandy...<br> Don't call me.<br> It's 2 a.m.<br> Can't this wait?<br> I don't care.<br> Get me off this show in 10 days.<br> - It's impossible.<br> - Then I'm getting a new agent.<br> You hurt my feelings.<br> What happened?<br> I told her about Julie.<br> She thinks I'm gay.<br> - Julie thinks your gay?<br> - No, my friend Sandy.<br> Well, sleep with her.<br> - I did and she still thinks I'm gay.<br> - Oh, that's not so good.<br> I gotta get back to my life.<br> You got lots of lawyers...<br> ...there must be a way to get<br> me out of this show.<br> - We've been through this.<br> - Why can't Dorothy have an accident?<br> We can use our imaginations.<br> This isn't too tough.<br> Kill somebody and bring back the stiff,<br> but she'd better look like you.<br> - They don't miss a trick.<br> - These are nice, good people.<br> Since when do you care so much<br> about what other people feel?<br> You should have seen Julie's face<br> when she thought I was a lesbian.<br> Lesbian?<br> You just said "gay."<br> Sandy thinks I'm gay.<br> Julie thinks I'm a lesbian.<br> - I thought Dorothy was straight.<br> - She is.<br> Les, the sweetest man in the world,<br> asked me to marry him.<br> A guy named Les<br> wants to marry you?<br> Yeah.<br> No, wants to marry Dorothy.<br> - He knows she's a lesbian?<br> - She's not!<br> - I know that, but does he?<br> - Know what?<br> That...<br> Well, I don't know.<br> You know he gave me a ring?<br> He gave me a diamond ring.<br> What did you say?<br> "I got to think it over."<br> I went in the ladies' room<br> and almost pissed in the sink.<br> Thirteen's up.<br> Ready 14.<br> Widen E.<br> Pull three to 130.<br> - Cut it.<br> - Stop tape.<br> We're gonna take<br> a short break, people.<br> Hold it, hold it!<br> Slight change of plans, children.<br> Our future ex-tape editor spilled<br> a bottle of celery tonic...<br> ...on the second reel<br> of the show airing today.<br> So we have to redo<br> Emily's party scene, live.<br> - Live?<br> - Quick, like bunnies.<br> You have 26 minutes.<br> Get into wardrobe.<br> - But Rita...<br> - You've only got a few lines.<br> Well, I don't see<br> why we can't use the tape.<br> Just because it's a little sticky.<br> Explain to them that<br> the hours have to be flexible.<br> No...<br> And I would...<br> Can I call you back?<br> Thank you.<br> My God, Dorothy! I just...<br> Really, I can't.<br> It's for Amy.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> That's nice.<br> - I don't know how to say this...<br> - I wish you wouldn't.<br> I understand that you weren't able<br> to tell my dad last night.<br> So it'd be better for all of us<br> if I tried to explain it to him.<br> Look, I wouldn't be honest<br> if I didn't tell you...<br> ...how much you've meant to me<br> these past couple weeks.<br> You taught me how to stand up<br> for myself because you always do.<br> You taught me to stop hiding<br> and just be myself...<br> ...because you're always yourself.<br> I'm grateful to you.<br> But...<br> Well, I just...<br> I just can't see you anymore,<br> you know?<br> I just feel it would be leading you on.<br> It wouldn't be fair to you.<br> I really love you, Dorothy.<br> But I can't...<br> I can't love you.<br> Places, everybody.<br> Immediately!<br> Fifteen seconds to commercial.<br> I don't care how you get there.<br> This is the most important night<br> in Emily's life.<br> We're all going to be there<br> to honor her, including you.<br> Stand by.<br> Quiet, please, on the floor.<br> Stand by.<br> Twenty-two and 23<br> come down to 18.<br> Hold it.<br> That's good.<br> Five, four, three...<br> Let's raise our glasses to our<br> guest of honor, Ms. Emily Kimberly.<br> We're looking forward to having<br> you grace us with your presence...<br> ...for many years to come.<br> Thank you, Gordon.<br> I can't tell you all how moved I am.<br> I never in my wildest dreams...<br> ...imagined that I would be the object<br> of so much genuine affection.<br> It makes it more difficult for<br> me to say what I'm now going to say.<br> I do feel it's time<br> to set the record straight.<br> I didn't come here<br> just as an administrator.<br> I came to this hospital<br> to settle a score.<br> What score?<br> My father built<br> this hospital.<br> But to his family...<br> ...he was an unmerciful tyrant.<br> An absolute dodo bird.<br> Oh, no! Not live.<br> Let's see where she goes.<br> He drove my mother to drink.<br> In fact, she went riding one time<br> and lost all her teeth.<br> What? What?<br> - the oldest daughter, the pretty,<br> charming one, became pregnant...<br> ...at 15 and was driven<br> out of the house.<br> She was so terrified that her daughter<br> would bear the stigma of illegitimacy...<br> ...she changed her name and contracted<br> a disfiguring disease...<br> ...after moving to Tangiers, where<br> she raised the girl as her sister.<br> But her one ambition...<br> Any preference of shots<br> on this one?<br> - was to become a nurse.<br> So she returned to the States<br> and joined the staff right here...<br> ...at Southwest General.<br> She worked here<br> and had to speak out...<br> ...wherever she saw injustice<br> and inhumanity.<br> Don't you understand that,<br> Dr. Brewster?<br> I never laid a hand on her.<br> Yes, you did. She was shunned<br> by all you nurses too.<br> Give me something, one.<br> Not backs.<br> Two and three go left and right.<br> No, two go left!<br> Three go right!<br> Her outspokenness threatened<br> you doctors.<br> But she was deeply, deeply,<br> deeply loved...<br> ...by her brother.<br> - Her brother?<br> This brother,<br> on the day of her death...<br> ...swore to the good Lord above<br> he'd follow in her footsteps.<br> And, and, and...<br> ...just, just, just...<br> Don't, don't, don't panic.<br> ...owe it all up to her!<br> But on her terms!<br> Here come the terms.<br> As a woman...<br> ...and just as proud to be a woman...<br> ...as she ever was...<br> ...for I am not Emily Kimberly...<br> ...the daughter of Dwayne...<br> ...and Alma Kimberly.<br> No, I'm not.<br> I'm Edward Kimberly,<br> Anthea's reckless brother.<br> Holy Christ!<br> Edward Kimberly, who's finally<br> vindicated his sister's good name.<br> I'm Edward Kimberly.<br> Edward Kimberly.<br> - I'll be damned.<br> - I'm not mentally ill, but proud...<br> ...and lucky to be the woman<br> that was the best part of my manhood.<br> The best part of myself.<br> That is one nutty hospital.<br> I knew there was a reason<br> she didn't like me!<br> Cut it!<br> Cut!<br> Does Jeff know?<br> Hey, Robert.<br> Hi, Les.<br> Get him!<br> All right!<br> Get him! Get him! Get him!<br> Oh, come on.<br> - I thought you'd want it back.<br> - Outside.<br> Give it to me outside.<br> Why'd you do it?<br> I needed the work.<br> The only reason you're still living is<br> because I never kissed you.<br> I hope you enjoyed the chocolates.<br> I gave them to a girl.<br> So did I. I thought.<br> Do you like them?<br> - Chocolates?<br> - Girls!<br> I like Julie.<br> I think I love Julie.<br> Wearing a dress is<br> a funny way to show it.<br> I know. I apologize.<br> The truth is,<br> you were okay company.<br> So were you.<br> I could have done<br> without the dancing.<br> You know, you're very good.<br> - I'm seeing a real nice woman now.<br> - Oh, really?<br> You think I didn't check her out?<br> Can I buy you a beer?<br> You got six bits.<br> Yeah.<br> Can I have a couple of beers?<br> Does Julie ever mention me?<br> Taxi!<br> Thank you.<br> Hi.<br> I saw your father.<br> I drove up to see him<br> in that bar he hangs out at.<br> He doesn't hang out there.<br> Oh, yeah. I forgot.<br> - How's Amy?<br> - Fine.<br> Your dad and I had a couple of beers<br> and shot a good game of pool.<br> We had a really good time together.<br> How's it going?<br> Terry Bishop's back on the show.<br> April lost her license...<br> - I meant with you.<br> - I know what you meant.<br> So you're pretty hot<br> after your unveiling.<br> What's your next triumph?<br> I'm going to do this play with...<br> Good. I've gotta catch a cab.<br> Can I call you sometime?<br> Look, I don't want to hold you up.<br> I just did it for the work.<br> I didn't mean to hurt anybody.<br> Especially you.<br> I miss Dorothy.<br> You don't have to.<br> She's right here.<br> And she misses you.<br> Look, you don't know me from Adam.<br> But I was a better man with you,<br> as a woman...<br> ...than I ever was with a woman,<br> as a man.<br> You know what I mean?<br> I just gotta learn to do it<br> without the dress.<br> At this point, there might be<br> an advantage to my wearing pants.<br> The hard part's over,<br> you know?<br> We were already...<br> ...good friends.<br> Will you loan me<br> that little yellow outfit?<br> Which one?<br> - The Halston.<br> - The Halston?<br> Oh, no!<br> You'll ruin it.<br> - You'll spill wine all over it.<br> - I will not.<br> I'll loan it to you, but you gotta<br> give it back. It's my favorite...<br> What are you gonna use it for?<br>
