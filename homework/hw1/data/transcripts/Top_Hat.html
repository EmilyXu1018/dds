                        I beg your pardon.<br> Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening, Mr. Hardwick.<br> - Has Mr. Jerry Travers come in yet?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> He's been waiting for you<br> the entire evening, sir.<br> The entire evening? Oh, dear.<br> Thanks.<br> Begging your pardon, sir.<br> But is that the Mr. Travers,<br> the well-known American gentleman, sir?<br> It is indeed.<br> He's come over to star in my show.<br> It's his first London appearance.<br> Your show, Mr. Hardwick?<br> I'm producing it.<br> But I don't want<br> any of the members here to know.<br> I want to surprise them.<br> I'm sure they'll be surprised,<br> Mr. Hardwick.<br> Hello, Jerry. I'm sorry I kept you waiting.<br> Jerry, there are a lot of things<br> that I have to discuss.<br> So I want you to come over<br> to my hotel now.<br> What happened?<br> Jerry, I forgot to tell you.<br> I want you to stay here for the night.<br> I'm sorry, I can't do it.<br> But you must, old man, really.<br> You see, at the moment, I'm having<br> a sort of a problem with my valet.<br> What do you want me to do,<br> press your pants?<br> No. You wouldn't know how.<br> No, you don't understand.<br> It's my man, Bates.<br> - We've had a bit of a tiff.<br> - How terrible.<br> - You didn't come to blows or anything?<br> - Nothing like that.<br> We're not speaking to each other.<br> We've had rather a clash of taste.<br> You see, Bates insists that a square tie...<br> is the only possible tie<br> that can be worn with evening clothes.<br> A square tie, imagine.<br> I prefer the butterfly.<br> - I think Bates is right.<br> - Bates is never right.<br> - Well, then why don't you fire him?<br> - That's a little difficult.<br> I'm hoping against hope<br> that the man will just disappear.<br> I hate to interfere<br> in these little family squabbles.<br> But let's hope he'll approve of me.<br> There's never any telling with Bates.<br> There you are.<br> If you please.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Good evening.<br> Allow us to introduce ourselves, sir.<br> We are Bates, sir.<br> Really?<br> - We are Jerry Travers.<br> - Welcome to our mnage.<br> Thank you, Bates.<br> It seems that I'm to stay here tonight.<br> At least that was the idea<br> of our beloved impresario.<br> Whose idea?<br> Mr. Hardwick's.<br> His idea.<br> Welcome anyhow.<br> Thank you, Bates.<br> Pardon, sir, but may we make<br> a personal observation?<br> - Not too personal.<br> - No, sir.<br> It's merely that we feel impelled<br> to compliment you, sir...<br> upon your excellent taste in ties.<br> - They like me.<br> - You never know.<br> Where on earth did you ever find him?<br> From the Salvation Army,<br> as a matter of fact.<br> I sent them a pair of very old shoes.<br> I see. And the shoes came back<br> and Bates was in them.<br> And he's been wearing<br> my good ones ever since.<br> - How's Madge feeling?<br> - She's fine. Thanks, Jerry.<br> The climate at the Lido<br> has done her a lot of good.<br> That's fine. Too bad she won't be here<br> for the opening tomorrow night.<br> Isn't it? She's heartbroken, really.<br> However, she's expecting us to fly down<br> to Italy for a weekend.<br> Fly down to Italy for a weekend?<br> I can't. I haven't got any goggles.<br> My word, Jerry, you'll have to go.<br> She's counting on us.<br> She's going to have<br> a young friend visit her.<br> I suspect there's something in the air.<br> You know Madge<br> and her matchmaking proclivities.<br> Is she expecting me<br> for a weekend or a wedding?<br> You can't tell. You know how wives are.<br> No, I don't. How are they?<br> Wives? They always have a little scheme.<br> Look here, I think it's about time<br> you found out for yourself.<br> - You do?<br> - I certainly do.<br> No, thanks, Horace.<br> In me you see a youth<br> who's completely on the loose.<br> No yens, no yearning.<br> Hello. This is Miss Tremont.<br> I'd like to speak<br> to the manager immediately.<br> Hello. Are you there?<br> Who? The manager. Yes.<br> I can't hear a word you're saying.<br> There's a young lady downstairs.<br> A young lady. At this time of night?<br> She can't come up here now.<br> No, I'd better come down myself.<br> Jerry, go right ahead.<br> A young lady downstairs<br> evidently wants to see me.<br> Hello.<br> Won't you come in?<br> I'm awfully glad you dropped in.<br> I dropped up from the room below,<br> where I've been trying to get some sleep.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't realize I was disturbing you.<br> You see, every once in a while,<br> I suddenly find myself...<br> dancing.<br> I suppose it's some kind of an affliction?<br> Yes, it's an affliction.<br> St. Vitus' dance.<br> And it only occurs at this time of night?<br> Yes, that's it.<br> It only occurs at this time of night.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I really shouldn't be left alone.<br> Yes, I can see that.<br> You probably should have<br> a couple of guards.<br> I think you're very unkind<br> to make fun of me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - I wish you wouldn't leave.<br> - Why not?<br> I think I feel an attack coming on.<br> See, there it is.<br> So I see.<br> There's only one thing that'll stop me.<br> You must tell me what it is.<br> My nurses always<br> put their arms around me.<br> I'll call the house detective<br> and tell him to put his arms around you.<br> Good night.<br> What are you doing here?<br> What are you carrying that for?<br> - Who was the young lady?<br> - What young lady?<br> That call wasn't for me. It was for you.<br> Somebody has registered a complaint.<br> I know. I've just seen the complaint.<br> She's lovely, she's delightful,<br> she's charming, and she wants to sleep.<br> She does?<br> And I'm going to help her,<br> and you're going to help me. Take this.<br> No, bring it in here<br> and guard it with your life.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> - Never mind.<br> Look here, what's the idea?<br> The young lady downstairs wants to sleep.<br> So you told me.<br> I've appointed myself her official sandman.<br> But, Jerry...<br> What else have you got?<br> I'm sorry, sir,<br> but you've cleaned out the shop.<br> You better tell them<br> to plant some more for tomorrow.<br> They are all to go<br> to Miss Dale Tremont, sir?<br> That's right.<br> Her room number is 304.<br> What's that?<br> That's for the opening<br> of a butcher shop, sir.<br> - Send that up, too.<br> - But, sir, a horseshoe?<br> Why, yes, I may want to order<br> a peach orchard tomorrow.<br> What's the number of your room, sir?<br> Just charge it to Horace Hardwick,<br> room 404.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I wonder what Mr. Beddini<br> is going to say about this.<br> What can he say?<br> He's been sending her flowers daily<br> ever since they came here.<br> And entre nous...<br> the desk clerk has intimated...<br> that Mr. Beddini provides Miss Tremont<br> with all the niceties...<br> including her clothes.<br> Really?<br> And her niceties are very nice.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - I do hope you slept well last night.<br> - I slept well enough, but not long enough.<br> I'm sorry. I was hoping...<br> there was something I could do<br> to square myself.<br> That's quite all right.<br> I thought perhaps I could drive you<br> to the stables.<br> No, thank you. I have a hansom cab<br> waiting for me outside.<br> With a horse in front of it?<br> Yes. You see,<br> the stable people always use them.<br> They feel the horse is coming back.<br> Where's he been?<br> We're leaving tonight.<br> Has Mr. Beddini made arrangements?<br> Yes, Miss Tremont.<br> He's ordered your baggage<br> to be picked up at 7:00.<br> Thank you.<br> - Driver.<br> - Yes, miss?<br> Can't you go any faster than this?<br> Lord love a duck, miss. I can,<br> but I'm not allowed to leave the horse.<br> I meant the horse, of course.<br> It's like this, miss.<br> You see, the horse is kind of tired today...<br> on account of having won<br> the Grand National on Friday.<br> Are you trying to tell me<br> that this is a racehorse?<br> Yes, miss, and I've got his pedigree, too.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> his sire was Man O'War.<br> Who was his dam?<br> - I beg your pardon, miss?<br> - I said, who was his dam?<br> I don't know, miss. He didn't give a...<br> Peekaboo.<br> Stop this cab at once.<br> I don't know how.<br> I've never handled anything<br> more complicated than a Duesenberg.<br> Take it easy, Mavis.<br> What are we going to do?<br> In dealing with a girl or horse,<br> one just lets nature take its course.<br> There we are, miss.<br> I told you the horse<br> would bring you to the right place.<br> What is this strange power<br> you have over horses?<br> Horsepower.<br> Don't I even get any thanks?<br> Buy yourself a new hat.<br> Cab, miss?<br> May I rescue you?<br> No, thank you, I prefer being in distress.<br> Charming little spot you have here.<br> When does the concert start?<br> Just as soon as you and the rain stop.<br> Now, please.<br> You wouldn't like to be<br> just a little bit more friendly, would you?<br> Why should I?<br> I don't know you from Adam.<br> Maybe it's the way I'm dressed.<br> Are you afraid of thunder?<br> No, it's just the noise.<br> You know what thunder is, don't you?<br> Of course.<br> It's something about the air.<br> No, when a clumsy cloud from here<br> meets a fluffy little cloud from there...<br> he billows towards her...<br> she scurries away<br> and he scuds right up to her.<br> She cries a little...<br> and there you have your shower.<br> He comforts her.<br> They spark.<br> That's the lightning.<br> They kiss.<br> Thunder.<br> Who is sending you this horse's shoe?<br> How cute.<br> Alberto, I've seen him.<br> I've talked to him. I've danced with him.<br> - Him? Who is this him?<br> - Who?<br> His name is Adam.<br> You forget this Adam.<br> You have promised to go with me to Italy.<br> Your friend Madge Hardwick<br> is awaiting you.<br> There, you will dazzle the eyes<br> in clothes designed by Alberto Beddini.<br> Alberto, I hope you don't mind,<br> but I'm not going to the Lido.<br> Madre mia. What you say?<br> My dear, listen to me.<br> We have made agreement.<br> Beddini designs the clothes...<br> which you wear among your friends,<br> the smart people.<br> So that they ask:<br> "Who is so smart<br> as to make these smart clothes?"<br> And you say,<br> "Who? Who is so smart? Beddini. "<br> Forget this Adam. Beddini demands it.<br> Beddini does, does he?<br> Alberto, up to the present, our relationship<br> has been purely a business one.<br> But if you start interfering<br> in my personal affairs...<br> I'll go back to America<br> and live on the dole.<br> Now, Dale darling, I'm so sorry.<br> I did not mean to interfere.<br> Go ahead, fall in love with this Adam.<br> Marry him.<br> But, as Mrs. Adam, what would you wear?<br> Fig leaves.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Dale, a telegram for you.<br> Read it to me, please.<br> "Come ahead, stop.<br> "Stop being a sap, stop.<br> "You can even bring Alberto, stop.<br> "My husband is stopping<br> at your hotel, stop.<br> "When do you start, stop. "<br> I cannot understand. Who wrote this?<br> Sounds like Gertrude Stein.<br> No, it's from Madge Hardwick.<br> She says her husband is stopping<br> at this hotel and will look you up.<br> Wonder what kind of man Madge married.<br> He's sure to have influence.<br> Let's be nice to him.<br> I'm going to be too busy<br> being nice to somebody else.<br> Dale, you can't do this.<br> All my life I have promised my dresses<br> to take them to Italy...<br> and you must be in them.<br> Sorry, Alberto, but I'm unpacking.<br> Never again will I allow<br> women to wear my dresses.<br> - Good evening, Miss Tremont.<br> - Good evening.<br> Mr. Beddini and I have decided to stay.<br> I'm so glad. Then I'll cancel the order<br> about the bags.<br> Thank you. Is there a Mr. Hardwick<br> stopping at this hotel?<br> Why, yes, Miss Tremont.<br> Mr. Hardwick has room 404.<br> Just above you.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Definitely, miss.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> there's Mr. Hardwick now...<br> on the mezzanine.<br> The gentleman<br> with the briefcase and cane.<br> - Horace, here's a telegram for you.<br> - For me?<br> - It's from Italy.<br> - Italy? That's probably from Madge.<br> There's a message in your room<br> to call the box office.<br> Some trouble about the tickets<br> or something.<br> Trouble? With the tickets?<br> My word, Jerry. Why, they wouldn't dare.<br> Will you hold those things for me please?<br> Get a taxi and I'll meet you downstairs.<br> All right.<br> Cab, miss?<br> When a clumsy cloud meets<br> a fluffy little cloud.<br> We're only trying<br> to investigate matters, miss.<br> We must protect our guests.<br> She does not need your protection.<br> I am too much protection enough.<br> There's nothing to investigate.<br> Nothing matters, nothing's happened.<br> Will you please ask<br> these gentlemen to go?<br> You mean to tell me<br> that girl slapped your face...<br> in front of all those people for nothing?<br> What would you have done, sold tickets?<br> I mean, you did nothing,<br> and yet she slapped your face?<br> - Now you're getting it.<br> - I wish you'd be serious about this.<br> One breath of scandal at this time<br> will ruin our show.<br> Why, I'd rather have had it happen<br> to me than to you.<br> - Lf you enjoy that sort of thing.<br> - I do, immensely.<br> Don't be absurd.<br> I hate men. I hate you. I hate all men!<br> But cara mia, you make a big mistake.<br> I am no man.<br> I am Beddini.<br> How could he have made love to me<br> when he was married all the time?<br> And to Madge of all people.<br> So, this snake in the grass, this Adam...<br> already he has eaten the apple?<br> Yes.<br> I will kill him for you.<br> Have you finished packing?<br> But you do not understand.<br> Are we leaving or aren't we?<br> No, you cannot go back to America.<br> We must go to the Lido.<br> But I can't face his wife.<br> And why not?<br> Women are facing wives every day.<br> And, after all, you can't avoid seeing<br> Madge sometime, can you?<br> I guess not.<br> Very well then.<br> Why not face the musicians now?<br> All right. Maybe she ought to know.<br> You're sure<br> you didn't forget yourself in the park?<br> Positive.<br> If I ever forgot myself with that girl,<br> I'd remember it.<br> - We're the management.<br> - Are you?<br> Oh, dear. Some more<br> of these plural personalities.<br> Just a moment.<br> Jerry, get into my bedroom, quick.<br> No one must know you're here.<br> If they ever suspect that you're in this,<br> it'll be in every newspaper in an hour.<br> Well, gentlemen,<br> this is a pleasant surprise.<br> A small matter of great import<br> has come to our attention, sir.<br> I am up here in your interest<br> and to protect the hotel.<br> - We wish to avoid any scandal.<br> - Scandal?<br> Yes, in connection<br> with a certain slap in the face.<br> The young lady refuses to divulge<br> why she slapped you.<br> Well, she didn't slap my face.<br> Who did she slap?<br> Why, it was... Who?<br> It was he, my valet.<br> Me, sir?<br> Why, of course. Don't argue with me.<br> How did it happen?<br> Possibly we had been<br> a little imprudent, sir.<br> Of course. You see,<br> we had been a little imprudent.<br> But you said it wasn't you.<br> Not Mr. Hardwick.<br> Gentlemen, we take all the blame myself.<br> And there we are. There you are.<br> You see, it was just a mistake.<br> I'll take him to task personally.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Not at all.<br> - Good night.<br> - Not at all.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Bates, thank you.<br> You know, really,<br> you are an invaluable assistant.<br> Thank you, sir. Allow us, sir.<br> Thank you, Bates.<br> - Your coat, sir.<br> - Really?<br> This is like old times, isn't it?<br> Your helping me with my coat, I mean.<br> It's a pleasure we have missed, sir.<br> - Thank you, Bates.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> How is our lumbago this evening, sir?<br> - It's so much better, Bates, thank you.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Bates.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> There's a crisis afoot.<br> Couldn't we bury the hatchet?<br> I mean, couldn't we forget<br> all about the ties?<br> Sic transit gloria mundi, sir.<br> - Bates.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Mr. Travers is in trouble.<br> He's practically put his foot<br> right into a hornet's nest.<br> But, hornets' nests grow on trees, sir.<br> Never mind that.<br> We have got to do something.<br> What about rubbing it with butter, sir?<br> You blasted fool,<br> you can't rub a girl with butter!<br> My sister got into a hornets' nest<br> and we rubbed her with butter, sir.<br> That's the wrong treatment.<br> You should have used mud.<br> Never mind that!<br> Mr. Travers is in trouble.<br> It is liable to develop into a scandal<br> that will involve all of us.<br> There's a young lady in the room below us.<br> I've seen her, sir.<br> I want you to find out<br> all you can about her.<br> Follow her wherever she goes.<br> Never take your eyes off her.<br> - Never, sir?<br> - Never.<br> - Whither she goes...<br> - Thither I, sir.<br> Right you are, sir. Whither or thither.<br> - What happened?<br> - It's all right. I fixed it.<br> But things are getting involved.<br> This is a deep-laid plot.<br> Nonsense. Why should this girl want<br> to involve me?<br> Why, for money, of course. Publicity.<br> Anything to create a scandal.<br> I'm going to see her and buy her off.<br> You're not. If anyone's going to buy<br> her anything, I am going to do it.<br> No, you stay right here.<br> I'll clear this all up myself.<br> It's probably some little thing you did...<br> carried away for the moment,<br> that offended her sense of decorum.<br> If I did, I'm going right down<br> and do it again. Goodbye, old boy.<br> Come along, cara mia.<br> - Get me a taxi, quickly.<br> - Taxi.<br> Follow that cab.<br> Come in.<br> Where's the young lady<br> that has this room?<br> She's gone, sir.<br> - Gone?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You don't mind if I get on with me work?<br> I gotta get these flowers out<br> in the morning's rubbish.<br> That's all right, go ahead. Go right ahead.<br> Jerry, do you realize that we have<br> less than an hour before the show opens?<br> We've got to get out of here. Come on.<br> Women do strange things sometimes,<br> don't they, George?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - That first act was simply marvelous.<br> - Good.<br> Everybody's crazy about it.<br> The critics are raving.<br> I've got some more good news.<br> - Did you find out were she's gone?<br> - She? Oh, that girl.<br> No, but, Jerry, please.<br> The entire Thackeray Club is out in front.<br> You don't suppose<br> my dancing has disturbed them?<br> I don't think so. They didn't say.<br> Of course not. It's perfectly all right here.<br> Second act begins, Mr. Travers.<br> Thanks. I'll be there.<br> Really, the second act.<br> A lot of telegrams for you.<br> I'll be right back<br> as soon as the act is over.<br> My word, I never read<br> my own telegram from Madge.<br> Isn't it too bad she isn't here tonight?<br> The biggest night of my life<br> and she isn't here.<br> - What does she say?<br> - All kinds of good wishes for our success.<br> Sorry we can't fly down to Italy after<br> the performance to meet her friend.<br> Her little friend is in London,<br> staying at my hotel.<br> Her name is Tremont.<br> Tremont? Wait a minute. Let me see that.<br> Horace, hire a plane right away.<br> We're leaving for Italy in the morning.<br> One minute, Mr. Travers.<br> You can't do that. The seats were sold out<br> for months in advance.<br> How long does it take to fly there?<br> Seven hours. You have to be back<br> Monday for a performance.<br> Charter a plane for the weekend,<br> we'll be back in time.<br> You're on, Mr. Travers.<br> I will not jeopardize my position.<br> If you want this show to run two nights,<br> get me a plane now.<br> - What kind of a plane?<br> - One with wings.<br> I'll go look for Madge<br> and see you later for cocktails.<br> - Dale, when did you get down?<br> - Just now.<br> Good. Have something to drink.<br> Horse's neck.<br> - It's grand seeing you.<br> - And it's grand seeing you.<br> Now tell me, did my husband look you up?<br> - Yes.<br> - How did he impress you?<br> I think he is very fascinating.<br> Fascinating?<br> You know, every once in a while, the effect<br> Horace has on people surprises me.<br> He sort of surprised me, too.<br> I'm glad you liked him.<br> He will be here today.<br> No. He can't...<br> What's the matter? Did he flirt with you?<br> He sent me a room full of flowers.<br> That was sweet of him.<br> But, Madge, you don't understand, he...<br> - He chased me in the park.<br> - Really?<br> I didn't know<br> Horace was capable of that much activity.<br> Did he catch you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good for Horace.<br> Why, Madge, you shock me.<br> Horace flirts with<br> every attractive girl he meets.<br> He doesn't mean anything.<br> That's a funny way to take it.<br> My dear, when you are as old as I am,<br> you'll take your men as you find them.<br> If you can find them.<br> And another thing, Jerry.<br> The gossip at the hotel<br> was that this man, Beddini...<br> was supplying her with everything.<br> Money, clothes, flowers.<br> No, Horace, you provided the flowers.<br> I? I never did anything.<br> I didn't even know her. Don't be ridiculous.<br> But anyway, as soon as we land,<br> I'm going to see Madge...<br> and I am going to find out from her<br> just who and what this Tremont person is.<br> I only want to find out where.<br> Now, Jerry, I warn you...<br> you don't realize the trouble<br> a designing woman can make for a man.<br> Now, I know all about these things.<br> I wouldn't tell this to anybody.<br> I am the victim<br> of a designing woman myself.<br> - Surely you don't mean Madge?<br> - Why, certainly, who else?<br> Not Madge. She doesn't know<br> anything about it either.<br> Her name is Violet.<br> She is what the French call a passade.<br> I see. Little ships that pass in the night.<br> Ships? Yes. Exactly.<br> I met her at the birdhouse in the zoo.<br> She was a very pretty little thing<br> and she seemed to be quite frightened.<br> Of the birds?<br> Yes. You see,<br> she had led a very sheltered life.<br> It was the storks in particular<br> that worried her.<br> I took her to a cinema...<br> and then we had dinner<br> and then I took her to another cinema.<br> Then I fear<br> I forgot myself and let her kiss me.<br> That must be his plane now. Come on.<br> No, I'd rather not.<br> Come on. If I were you...<br> I wouldn't miss this opportunity<br> of seeing the early worm get the bird.<br> You know, Dale, I haven't told you<br> the real reason I asked you down here.<br> Haven't you?<br> No, I feel I've known you long enough<br> to have the right to talk to you this way.<br> In spite of the fact that<br> all men are males...<br> there is no feeling so secure as having<br> a good, reliable husband. I know.<br> - Jerry.<br> - Hello, Madge, I'll see you in a minute.<br> Where did Miss Tremont go?<br> - Dale didn't tell me she'd met you.<br> - Yes, we've met.<br> Fine, I've arranged<br> a little dinner party for all of us.<br> Let's eat now.<br> Leave the child alone,<br> she's a little upset about something.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes. Tell me, how did Dale strike you?<br> - Right between the eyes.<br> - Good.<br> - Where's Horace?<br> - I left him struggling with the baggage.<br> The hotel's crowded and both of you<br> will have to bunk together tonight.<br> Dale's with me.<br> - Did you get that room for my husband?<br> - Si, signora, but I am so sorry...<br> because of the carnival,<br> the only thing available is the bridal suite.<br> - The bridal suite.<br> - How romantic. Thank you.<br> Signor, are you Horace Hardwick?<br> Thank you, I am. How do you do?<br> - I am very displeased to meet you.<br> - Really?<br> What do you mean, displeased?<br> Signor, I warn you.<br> For men of your kind,<br> this is not a healthy place.<br> My dear fellow, this is one<br> of the healthiest spots in Europe.<br> The air, the breeze, the flowers.<br> So it is funny tricks you're being.<br> I warn you...<br> never let your path<br> criss-cross mine again, or the heart...<br> - Horace.<br> - How do you do?<br> Madge, darling.<br> My, your passion frightens me.<br> - Been practicing?<br> - Yes. Well, scarcely. No.<br> Madge, what do you think<br> has happened to me?<br> - I know. You got your first long trousers.<br> - Madge, please.<br> There's something down here<br> that I have to investigate...<br> and Jerry thinks that I...<br> Maybe I better tell it anonymously.<br> You know, it sounds as if you were<br> about to confess something, Horace.<br> Does it? What would I have to confess?<br> You really want to tell me<br> about Dale Tremont, don't you?<br> Yes, but then again, no.<br> You see, as a matter of fact,<br> I haven't even met her yet.<br> - You haven't met her?<br> - No.<br> If that's your story, Horace,<br> you stick to it.<br> I suppose you weren't in the park, either.<br> The park, my dear girl,<br> it happened in the zoo. What?<br> The zoo... Yes. The zoo was in the park.<br> How did you know I was there?<br> - A little bird told me.<br> - The stork?<br> I think, after the trip<br> I better clean up a bit.<br> - Of course, I understand just how you feel.<br> - Yes.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - It's Madge.<br> - Has she been chasing you?<br> - No.<br> Jerry, I think she's found out about Violet.<br> And I just had my life threatened.<br> But what did he say?<br> He just lied in a straightforward manner,<br> and said he'd never met you.<br> - He did, did he?<br> - I told you he'd forget all about you.<br> I'll make him remember me<br> in a manner he'll never forget.<br> Has Horace been away from you lately<br> for any length of time?<br> Well, he was alone<br> on the Continent last year.<br> Connect me<br> with Mr. Hardwick's apartment, please.<br> Madge, have you any objections<br> if I scare your husband...<br> so that he'll never look at another woman?<br> Dale, no husband<br> is ever too scared to look.<br> Hello.<br> Hello, where are you?<br> So you do remember me?<br> He remembers me all right.<br> - Are you alone?<br> - Completely and desolately.<br> Fine. I'll be right up.<br> Horace, she's coming up.<br> She's coming up here?<br> She can't do that. It isn't proper.<br> - She wants to see me alone.<br> - Alone? Jerry.<br> What did I tell you?<br> She wants to compromise you.<br> Rack your brains, please.<br> Couldn't you have met<br> that girl someplace else before?<br> I could have met her in Moscow.<br> - In Moscow. You see?<br> - But I've never been to Moscow.<br> Couldn't you have met her in Paris?<br> The last time I was in Paris,<br> I was 10 years old.<br> Jerry, I don't think it's safe<br> for you to see that girl alone.<br> I don't think it would be quite proper<br> for you to receive her that way.<br> Hello.<br> I know you'll think this is<br> a little unconventional of me...<br> but I just couldn't wait to see you alone.<br> I'm awfully glad you came up.<br> My darling.<br> Hello. How have you been?<br> I've been missing you terribly.<br> I came down<br> on the fastest plane I could get.<br> No, I meant before yesterday.<br> - Before yesterday?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> Don't you remember?<br> Should I?<br> Have you forgotten...<br> - what we've been to each other?<br> - No.<br> What we've been to each other...<br> I knew yesterday in the park,<br> when I was dancing in your arms...<br> - you remembered who I was.<br> - Of course.<br> Who are you?<br> Then you still don't remember?<br> I can try to remember something.<br> How could you forget<br> that funny little house...<br> and the suspicious concierge...<br> and that quaint little room?<br> We used to have tea and muffins<br> in front of the fireplace...<br> watching the<br> shadows leaping on the ceiling.<br> And those long walks down that<br> twisty cobblestone street to the river.<br> Paris is heavenly in the spring.<br> So that's where we met.<br> Yes, last year.<br> In Paris.<br> Why, of course.<br> It's all coming back to me now.<br> Is it?<br> Yes, but you weren't calling<br> yourself Dale Tremont.<br> - Wasn't I?<br> - No, it was...<br> Madeline, that was it.<br> I called you Mad for short.<br> You've put on a little weight, haven't you?<br> Remember that night on the Left Bank...<br> you had on that little blue dress<br> I bought for you?<br> And to think that I almost forgot you...<br> Tell me something.<br> Do you still have that awful weakness<br> for diamond bracelets?<br> I suppose I do.<br> Make yourself comfortable, darling.<br> I'll order some cocktails.<br> A little later on,<br> we'll have supper up here, just we two.<br> It'll be like old times, won't it?<br> I think I'd better be going.<br> I'll let you go on one condition.<br> Promise me, now that I found you again...<br> we can be to each other<br> what we were in Paris.<br> There, you see? I was right.<br> Of all the scheming, brazen creatures...<br> trying to pretend<br> that she met you in Paris.<br> Do you realize that she's<br> deliberately trying to trap you?<br> - What are you going to do about it?<br> - Marry her.<br> Jerry, this is no time for you to be funny.<br> All right, then, you be funny.<br> I'm going down<br> and ask her to marry me right now.<br> Jerry, please wait.<br> Now, before you make<br> a complete fool of yourself...<br> promise me that you won't ask her...<br> until I find out from Madge<br> more about her past.<br> All right, you find out all about her past...<br> and I'll go down and plan her future.<br> - Remember, that's a promise.<br> - All right, it's a promise.<br> What happened? Did you scare him?<br> No. He scared me.<br> What did he do, make faces at you?<br> You know, sometimes<br> I get up in the morning...<br> and I take a good look at him<br> and he frightens me, too.<br> He mistook me for someone called<br> Madeline he'd met in Paris.<br> Really?<br> Madge, do you think you ought<br> to let him go away from you alone?<br> I don't believe he was nearly so innocent<br> in Paris as you seem to think.<br> Darling, you interest me.<br> I must send him to China next year.<br> But, Madge,<br> you don't seem to understand.<br> I'm trying to tell you that I'm afraid...<br> that we're carrying this thing too far.<br> You know, I wonder if you've seen<br> something in Horace...<br> that I've never seen.<br> I wonder what's keeping Horace.<br> What's the matter?<br> I'm afraid I'm going to have a headache.<br> Don't go. This is a meeting<br> I've been planning a long time.<br> Good evening.<br> It's nice to see you again, Miss Tremont.<br> You've robbed me of the pleasure<br> of introducing you two.<br> You've already met.<br> Yes, we've met last spring.<br> I hope you see a lot of each other.<br> You know, Madge is<br> the most understanding person.<br> She seems to know instinctively<br> the kind of girl that interests me.<br> I don't know what I'd do without her.<br> That's sweet of you, darling.<br> You two run along and dance,<br> and don't give me another thought.<br> That's what I'm afraid of.<br> I think Madge is a very brave person.<br> Yes, I have<br> a tremendous admiration for her.<br> Well, if Madge doesn't care,<br> I certainly don't.<br> Neither do I, all I know is that it's...<br> Why don't you tell me<br> what this is all about?<br> You know we never met in Paris.<br> I know. I'm afraid<br> I haven't been quite fair with you.<br> You see, I know who you are.<br> What difference does that make?<br> - So that doesn't make any difference?<br> - No, why should it?<br> I don't know who you are, and I don't care.<br> That's big of you.<br> Well...<br> Well, what?<br> Aren't you now supposed to say...<br> we should think<br> only of what we mean to each other...<br> that we're entitled to live our own lives?<br> I don't think I'd say it<br> that way exactly, but aren't we?<br> Go on.<br> If it weren't for a promise I made<br> in a moment of weakness...<br> I would go on.<br> You made a promise.<br> That shouldn't make<br> much difference to you.<br> That's right. Forget it, marry me.<br> How could I have fallen in love<br> with anyone as low as you?<br> She loves me.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Packing.<br> I'm leaving. You don't know<br> what a mess we've got into.<br> Why, what's the matter?<br> Your husband.<br> - He wants to divorce you and marry me.<br> - I see.<br> He wants to do right by both of us.<br> Did he mention any settlement?<br> No.<br> That'll come later.<br> He'll probably want me<br> to pay myself alimony.<br> Now listen, Dale. I don't want you to go.<br> That won't solve anything.<br> I can't stay here under the circumstances.<br> Here or there,<br> as long as you remain a spinster...<br> you're fair game for any philandering male.<br> You know, what you really should have...<br> is a husband you can call your own.<br> Seriously, I mean it.<br> But what are we going to do<br> about your husband?<br> Don't worry, dear. I'll do it.<br> Come in.<br> Darling.<br> All I said was darling and she smacked me.<br> Jerry, how does it look? Tell me frankly.<br> It looks like a sunrise by Maxfield Parrish.<br> Jerry, that's terrible.<br> I can't go around now like this.<br> Put a piece of raw steak on it.<br> That'll take the swelling down.<br> It would?<br> - A steak?<br> - Sure.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Order a steak.<br> - A steak. Very good, sir.<br> You know, Jerry, I can't imagine<br> what's got into Madge recently.<br> She's never hit me before.<br> Maybe she just never thought of it before.<br> Room service.<br> Yes. This is the bridal suite.<br> Yes, will you please send up<br> a nice, juicy steak?<br> I beg your pardon?<br> Yes, mashed potatoes, and carrots...<br> and spinach. Yes, of course, coffee...<br> As soon as you get your eye fixed,<br> we'll go down and see Madge.<br> Where do you want it, sir?<br> - Want what, Bates?<br> - The steak, sir.<br> On my eye.<br> On your eye, sir?<br> My word, why do I always<br> have to say things twice?<br> On my eye means on my eye, doesn't it?<br> - I beg your pardon, sir.<br> - Don't argue!<br> Jerry, you see what I'm up against.<br> The man has a sluggish brain,<br> always wants to debate things.<br> First it's a maniac, and then it's Madge,<br> and now it's Bates.<br> I give you my word,<br> if anything else happens, I'll go insane.<br> We are a grand success.<br> Every woman, she's saying this dress,<br> she's wonderful.<br> This Beddini is the tops.<br> I'm so happy.<br> No, but, cara mia, it's not the dress,<br> it's not Beddini.<br> It's you who wears it.<br> Thank you, Alberto.<br> What is it? Is it Adam again?<br> His Garden of Eden...<br> he has made you sad?<br> It's just that I'm all mixed up, that's all.<br> Why worry about this man?<br> I think I'm worrying more about his wife.<br> Beddini does not like to see you so sad.<br> Alberto, you seem to be<br> the only one left I can turn to.<br> Why don't you marry Beddini?<br> He'll make you happy.<br> Why not? I'm rich, I'm pretty...<br> and then this Hardwick<br> will leave you alone.<br> I'll marry you if you really want me to...<br> but let's do it right away.<br> First of all,<br> we'll get you straightened out...<br> and then I'll ask Madge about Dale.<br> Mr. Hardwick, dear sir, one of our<br> guests has informed us...<br> that he is to be married this evening.<br> We wondered<br> if you would give up your bridal suite.<br> - Give it up? Why we...<br> - We've hardly settled in it yet.<br> - Have we, angel?<br> - No, and all our clothes are... Please.<br> - Of course you may have it.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> I shall remove you elsewhere.<br> Come on, dear sir, brace up.<br> Madge has merely heard something<br> about this Violet girl.<br> We know it isn't the truth,<br> you tell her yourself...<br> that's all she's waiting for.<br> I know. That's what I'm afraid of.<br> Always remember that the truth<br> has never hurt any man.<br> Jerry, you are right.<br> Anyway, if it does,<br> I'll go to the hospital with you.<br> Horace, what is this, Halloween?<br> Madge, Horace has<br> a little confession to make.<br> I've been waiting for this for some time.<br> Come right in and get it off your chest.<br> You'd better take your glasses off.<br> Sit down.<br> You see, when Horace was in London,<br> he met a certain young lady.<br> And, Madge, you must have<br> had an inkling of this or...<br> - Or you wouldn't be telling me now.<br> - Never. What? Certainly.<br> What Horace means to say is...<br> that he'd like to make<br> a clean breast of the whole thing.<br> - Before I find out the truth.<br> - Exactly. Madge, this girl was... What?<br> Dear, I'm all mixed. Where am I?<br> - Hello.<br> - Madge, darling...<br> I wanted to call you<br> and tell you I just got married.<br> You got what?<br> I'm sorry, dear, I can't hear you.<br> It sounds just as if you said<br> you got married.<br> - I did.<br> - Where are you now?<br> Going to the bridal suite?<br> Very proper place<br> for a bride and groom, isn't it?<br> Darling, I must compliment you<br> on your speedy work...<br> but who on earth did you find<br> to marry you so quickly?<br> Alberto? You'd better hang up, Dale, dear.<br> - I think I'm going to faint.<br> - Dale.<br> What was that?<br> - Dale Tremont married?<br> - Yes, to that dressmaker.<br> - Good.<br> - Good? What did you have to do with this?<br> - It's all his fault.<br> - My fault?<br> Yes, she told me how you chased her<br> in the park and she slapped your face.<br> Yes, but I'm the one she slapped.<br> She's been mistaking me<br> for Horace all this time.<br> No wonder she thought<br> Horace was fascinating.<br> No wonder. I resent that.<br> - Madge, where is she now?<br> - On her way to the bridal suite.<br> Bridal suite.<br> I'll see you later.<br> But, Jerry, you can't do a thing like that.<br> It isn't fair.<br> All is fair in love and war,<br> and this is revolution.<br> - Yes, this is very pretty.<br> - Thank you, dear sir.<br> We are very proud<br> of our bridal arrangements.<br> Is there anything else, sir?<br> Yes, would you please ask my wife<br> to join me here?<br> It is a pleasure, dear sir.<br> What are you doing here?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Yes, but this is my room.<br> - Yes, but this is my room.<br> - But I have the key.<br> But I have the key.<br> - But I am Beddini.<br> - You got me there, pal.<br> We will see who is the owner of this room.<br> But, Jerry, you shouldn't be in here.<br> - It isn't cricket.<br> - No, Horace, it isn't tiddlywinks either.<br> Signor, there is a man in my bed.<br> It's too bad. He's not here yet.<br> I'll just wait until my uncle returns.<br> Thank you.<br> Why, Jerry, I didn't know<br> that you had an uncle here.<br> - Didn't you know?<br> - No.<br> I haven't, but this room is<br> just above the bridal suite.<br> He's not here, signor.<br> If he returns, you will call us.<br> If he returns, I will kill him.<br> We Beddini have the motto:<br> For the woman, the kiss.<br> For the man, the sword.<br> Dale, you are lovely.<br> Like a flower I am afraid to crush.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> Alberto, make him stop!<br> Who is it? You know?<br> Yes, it's Horace.<br> Horace Hardwick, that interloper.<br> I'll stop him.<br> For the man, the sword.<br> Mrs. Hardwick's apartment, please.<br> - He's coming.<br> - Is he?<br> You keep this up and hold him<br> here as long as you can.<br> I will.<br> Madge, you'd better come over<br> and rescue Horace.<br> Alberto has gone after him with a sword.<br> Why, yes, of course.<br> I'm sorry to break in like this,<br> but I simply had to see you.<br> Will you please stop annoying me?<br> But you've been mistaken about me.<br> - I'm afraid I haven't.<br> - All right, then.<br> I'll stay right here and there will be<br> a scene with your husband.<br> He'll be furious if he finds you here.<br> Then please come with me<br> for a few minutes.<br> I've simply got to talk to you.<br> And so you see, my dear chap,<br> I am definitely the wrong person.<br> - But you are Horace Hardwick, no?<br> - Yes, of course I am Horace Hardwick.<br> Then you are not<br> the wrong person. Prepare.<br> Don't mind me.<br> I just came up to see the fun.<br> Madge, explain to this maniac that<br> he is making a very serious mistake.<br> He may be making a mistake,<br> but it's not serious.<br> Go right ahead, Alberto.<br> No, I cannot kill him before a lady.<br> If you're going to pull out on us, Alberto,<br> maybe it's best that you don't kill him.<br> I may want that pleasure myself someday.<br> But why didn't you tell me who you were?<br> After all, I mean, you never gave me<br> very much of a chance.<br> Mr. Travers!<br> Help, somebody.<br> I am so sorry.<br> I really did not want to kill you.<br> - You must forgive me.<br> - I forgive you.<br> Go right ahead, boys, don't mind me.<br> Not tonight, Alberto.<br> Some other time<br> when I'm feeling stronger.<br> Thank you.<br> - Pardon me, sir.<br> - What is it? What's the matter?<br> What have you been doing?<br> Pardon me, sir,<br> Mr. Travers and Miss Tremont, sir...<br> they're drifting out to the bay<br> in a gondola, sir.<br> There. That ought to make you<br> feel pretty small, accusing me.<br> - He's kidnapped her.<br> - Kidnapped her?<br> You are in this plot.<br> You are cahooting with him.<br> I've had just about enough...<br> Children, if Dale and Jerry<br> are drifting out to sea...<br> don't you think the best thing<br> we could do is rescue them?<br> Yes, come.<br> Isn't it marvelous to have some brains?<br> I'm always so helpless.<br> Don't answer me like that. Do something.<br> - Jerry.<br> - That isn't Jerry.<br> That's right. Make a fool of yourself.<br> It's no crime to look, is it?<br> - I think there is no gas left.<br> - My word, no petrol?<br> Perhaps I'd better look at the engine,<br> where is it?<br> They may have hidden it up there<br> under the hood.<br> This is the first time<br> I ever had to walk back from a boat ride.<br> Jerry, you mustn't come with me.<br> I'd rather talk to Alberto alone.<br> Alberto will have to get accustomed<br> to talking in front of me.<br> No, seriously,<br> I'd rather you wouldn't. Please.<br> When am I going to see you again?<br> I don't know.<br> Mr. Travers, they went after you, sir,<br> to look for you, sir, in a motorboat.<br> - Mr. Beddini, too?<br> - Yes, sir, all three of them...<br> but they won't be back this evening, sir.<br> We took the precaution<br> of removing the gasoline.<br> Thank you, Bates.<br> What is it, my good man?<br> Yes. I'm masquerading.<br> Don't you understand English?<br> You don't understand English?<br> Well, I've been waiting for an opportunity<br> like this since my childhood.<br> You frozen-faced flatfoot.<br> And grazie to you if it comes to that,<br> you stultified shrimp.<br> Can I help it if you look<br> like a mildewed donkey?<br> I'm adoring this.<br> And grazie to you, since you insist.<br> You see, I happen to be breaking the law.<br> I admit it wholeheartedly...<br> but, of course, you would never know that,<br> you fish-faced nincompoop.<br> Good night.<br> I arrest you for masquerading<br> as a gondolier.<br> I further charge you with insulting<br> an officer with vile names...<br> according to Rule Three, Section Three<br> of the law dealing with delinquents.<br> Beg your pardon, signoro,<br> the carnival is beginning.<br> Shall I serve now<br> or will you wait for the groom?<br> I don't think the groom<br> will be here tonight.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - Very good? It's perfect.<br> I still feel a little guilty<br> being here with you...<br> while Alberto's out looking for us.<br> Let's eat, drink, and be merry,<br> for tomorrow we have to face him.<br> The hour of reckoning is at hand.<br> Beddini is about to settle his accounts.<br> Skipper, will you tell<br> my husband we're here?<br> He's the one with his mouth closed.<br> Listen, you two idiots,<br> Alberto is as mad as a drunken toreador.<br> - Where is he?<br> - He's gone up to the room.<br> If you take my advice, you'll take<br> the first plane back to London pronto.<br> Not until I've asked Mr. Beddini for his<br> wife's hand. Do you think he'll accept me?<br> - Mr. Hardwick.<br> - What do you want?<br> I regret to report, my dear sir,<br> that your manservant has been arrested.<br> - Bates? Really?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> He would have spent the whole night<br> in jail if I had not bailed him out.<br> You don't mean it.<br> Come in.<br> At last.<br> The little birdies have come flying back<br> to the rooster.<br> Mr. Beddini, we want to explain<br> this whole thing to you.<br> I will not listen to any excuses,<br> not even the truth.<br> Jerry, Madge,<br> I have the most amazing news.<br> A few days ago,<br> my invaluable manservant, Bates...<br> Allow me to tell them, sir, please.<br> Quiet, your turn will come later.<br> A few days ago,<br> my invaluable manservant, Bates...<br> The needle has gotten stuck in a crack.<br> You tell it, Bates.<br> Thank you, madam.<br> You see, Miss Dale, Mr. Hardwick thought<br> you were a dangerous woman.<br> And he asked me to follow you<br> in case you did something dangerous.<br> - Follow me?<br> - Yes, miss.<br> And in order to put you off the scent,<br> I thought of many little disguises.<br> This evening, I met<br> Mr. Beddini and Miss Tremont...<br> and fearing<br> that they might recognize me...<br> I turned my collar around...<br> like this.<br> And very cleverly, I became a clergyman.<br> You are the one who married us.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Then we've never been really married?<br> Precisely, miss.<br> Well, Mr. Beddini...<br> what are you doing<br> in this young lady's room?<br>
