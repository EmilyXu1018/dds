Oh, excuse me.<br> I've just had a great idea.<br> Something I've been looking for<br> a long time. A very long time.<br> Josef, how many times have you<br> been in and out of the country?<br> Many times, many times.<br> I should say... Yes, 12 times.<br> Ever had a problem at<br> the border, at customs?<br> - Bah! They know me.<br> - Josef,<br> you're going to be very rich.<br> Do you like that?<br> I like that.<br> It will be some time before<br> I see you again, Josef.<br> I will wait for you.<br> This is...<br> You don't even know<br> who I am, or where I am.<br> First, my name is not really Elizabeth<br> Lipp, but please call me that.<br> It's convenient.<br> And I am in Turkey...<br> in Istanbul... in the seraglio.<br> This is where the old sultans lived.<br> They had a lot of wives<br> and other treasures,<br> so they made the palace<br> bigger and bigger.<br> Like each of the buildings here,<br> this little shack contains works<br> of art unique in the world.<br> The entire seraglio is now a museum...<br> the fabulous Topkapi Museum.<br> But... but there is one special room.<br> That's why I'm here. I'll show you.<br> Come in.<br> This cradle... pearls, rubies,<br> and pure, solid gold.<br> This is the famous<br> throne of Shah Ismael.<br> No king or emperor ever sat<br> on a throne more precious.<br> From every corner of the earth...<br> gifts made to the Turkish empire.<br> But I would give you all of them...<br> for just one dagger,<br> encrusted with diamonds and emeralds.<br> The four greatest emeralds<br> the world has ever known.<br> Dazzling.<br> Flawless.<br> All four are priceless.<br> But there is one that is perfection.<br> It has life. It is warm.<br> It has nerves, senses...<br> Oh, forgive me.<br> A strange thing happens to me.<br> Difficult to explain.<br> All right.<br> I'm going to have it.<br> It's going to be mine.<br> How?<br> I didn't finish introducing myself.<br> I am a thief.<br> Honest.<br> Excusez-moi, monsieur l'agent,<br> ou est l'Htel George V?<br> Vous descendez les Champs lyses<br> et vous prenez l'avenue George V.<br> - Merci.<br> - A votre sant, monsieur.<br> Merci, monsieur l'agent.<br> Taxi!<br> A gun is one thing,<br> intelligence is another.<br> Since I'm more afraid<br> of intelligence...<br> Htel George V. Here.<br> Up to your old tricks, Walter?<br> Hello, Elizabeth.<br> - What brings you here?<br> - That old magnetism. I was drawn to you.<br> It took three years to get<br> that old magnetism to work.<br> - How's the captain?<br> - Hm?<br> My successor.<br> It took three days for the<br> magnetism to wear off.<br> Seriously?<br> Seriously.<br> - Cannibal.<br> - It's like Chinese food.<br> One hour, and you're hungry again.<br> - What do you want?<br> - TUTS: You.<br> - Business? Pleasure?<br> - So many questions.<br> Let's go and eat. I am hungry.<br> - Where?<br> - My studio.<br> - Still the same?<br> - Slight change.<br> WALTER:<br> You've lost none of your skill.<br> - Darling, you too.<br> - I was talking seriously.<br> - I, too.<br> - You're never serious,<br> except when it comes<br> to stealing emeralds.<br> It's a living.<br> Well?<br> It's too tough.<br> But I'll do it.<br> - I knew you would.<br> - On one condition.<br> - Granted.<br> - I pick the crew.<br> - As always.<br> - Not as always.<br> This time, with amateurs.<br> - Amateurs?<br> - Only amateurs.<br> - All right, I give up.<br> - TUTS: My favourite pupil.<br> Sit down.<br> Lesson one... the three<br> cardinal rules of theft.<br> How Swiss you are. Eins, zwei, drei.<br> You're right. Eins...<br> plan meticulously.<br> - Zwei... execute...<br> - Cleanly.<br> - Drei?<br> - Don't get caught before, during...<br> Or after. That's right.<br> The Istanbul emeralds...<br> the most protected jewels in<br> the world... have been stolen.<br> Alarm system.<br> Check Cedric Page, London.<br> Cedric Page? What's that?<br> You will meet him.<br> Now, the emeralds are gone.<br> Policemen of the world unite.<br> You're Scotland Yard, Turkish police...<br> what do you do?<br> - What do I do?<br> - You eliminate the riffraff.<br> Obviously, this is a class job.<br> You dig out the dossiers on the<br> top professionals, the elite.<br> How many are they? Not more<br> than half a dozen, and all known.<br> But, there is no dossier<br> on Elizabeth Lipp...<br> not even Elizavetta Lippmanova...<br> because you have been lucky.<br> There's no dossier on Walter Harper...<br> not even Walter Haberlee...<br> because I have been efficient.<br> - What you would call "Swiss".<br> - Liebling.<br> So there must be no police record<br> on anyone who works with us.<br> Where do you find these<br> lily-white innocents?<br> That's my job.<br> What do you say?<br> Amateurs?<br> Amateurs.<br> Ah.<br> (SCREAMS)<br> He has many children, Cedric Page?<br> WALTER:<br> None. These are all his own toys.<br> - Come, look at this parrot.<br> - I don't like parrots.<br> This one isn't real.<br> I'm beginning to wonder<br> if anything is real.<br> ELIZABETH'S VOICE: I'm beginning<br> to wonder if anything is real.<br> MAN: Well you may, dear lady.<br> Like the old faith healer of Deal<br> who said, "Although pain isn't real,<br> when I sit on a pin and<br> it punctures my skin,<br> I dislike what I fancy I feel."<br> I'm Cedric Page. How nice of you to<br> come, Walter, and to bring Miss Lipp.<br> I see you've met my recording Polly.<br> Amusing, isn't she?<br> Oh, very. I hope it won't<br> record all our conversations.<br> Polly is the soul of discretion.<br> I never go anywhere without her.<br> Well, shall we move into my den?<br> We'll be more private in there.<br> Come along, Miss Lipp.<br> My newest toy.<br> It doesn't work with a ray.<br> Just the smallest<br> change of temperature,<br> the natural heat of the human body,<br> close enough to it does the trick.<br> If you had a refrigerated<br> dress, it wouldn't work!<br> Fortunately, I haven't. I very seldom<br> wear one, especially not in England.<br> Make yourselves comfortable.<br> The entertainment is charming.<br> - Is it all for me?<br> - I'm a terrible show-off.<br> But do let me offer you a drink.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - How was your trip to Istanbul?<br> Marvellous! Did you go on<br> the underground railway?<br> It's the oldest in Europe.<br> Did you bother to go to<br> the museum, Mr Page?<br> Well, of course. That was the<br> whole idea, wasn't it? The alarm.<br> I take my responsibilities in<br> this enterprise seriously,<br> as I'm sure you do, Miss Lipp.<br> Well, now, let's all go<br> into the museum, shall we?<br> Here is the door, shall we say?<br> And Walter... Walter is<br> the sultan... with the dagger.<br> Miss Lipp?<br> (PARADE MUSIC)<br> It was you weight that did it,<br> on the Treasury floor.<br> Perhaps I should have said,<br> "Even your weight".<br> Try again, just one foot.<br> (MUSIC)<br> Well, just the toe.<br> (MUSIC)<br> It's all based on a<br> little chap down here.<br> (MUSIC)<br> This is a delicate strain gauge.<br> There are hundreds of<br> them under the Treasury,<br> each one connected<br> to the alarm system.<br> They measure weight...<br> the smallest weight.<br> Even a ping pong ball.<br> (SCATTERED NOTES)<br> That's our problem.<br> Then all you have to do is to<br> find the switch and turn it off.<br> It could be anywhere,<br> hidden in the walls or the ceiling,<br> operated by remote control<br> a mile away or more.<br> And how do you propose to get into<br> a museum without touching the floor?<br> I wouldn't have to touch<br> the floor if I were a fly.<br> It isn't how I see you, Mr Page.<br> We have our human fly.<br> And our human fly holder.<br> - That's Giulio, that's Hans.<br> - And...<br> (MUSIC STARTS)<br> ..we have a sucker!<br> A sucker?<br> Yes. You'll catch on.<br> And we need another kind of sucker,<br> but him we'll find in the north of Greece.<br> In Kavala, near the Turkish border.<br> - Yianis, give me my money.<br> - Tomorrow.<br> - Young one. No money. Nothing.<br> - And no groups aboard there?<br> - Some English.<br> - English? Open that bag.<br> Let's have the box. Come on.<br> Where is it? Oh, ah, there we go.<br> Yes, the English lay great<br> store by things like this.<br> I hate to do it myself but,<br> c'est la vie!<br> Well, wish me luck, Voula.<br> Ah, Simpson!<br> So that's Arthur Simpson.<br> Arthur Simon Simpson...<br> historian, guide, and schmo.<br> Morning. First time<br> in Kavala, no doubt.<br> I'm Arthur Simpson,<br> archaeologist and historian.<br> I dug this up many...<br> Look, it's still wet.<br> This harbour's full of<br> historical connections.<br> Brutus spent the night<br> here before Philippi,<br> after that unpleasant business he had<br> with Shakespeare... Julius Caesar.<br> Viens, chrie.<br> Je parle Belgique...<br> Ceramics, handmade by the<br> descendants of ancient heroes here.<br> Ah, Reverend!<br> My name is Simpson, sir.<br> Arthur Simpson.<br> I'm Church of England myself.<br> It's a very religious place.<br> Do you know St Paul passed through<br> here on his way to Samothrace?<br> I do.<br> You'd be surprised to know the<br> amount of people that don't, Bishop.<br> Mack, want to see the nightlife of Kavala?<br> You want the belly dancers, stripteasers?<br> You showed me Kavala<br> nightlife. Remember?<br> - I'm not expensive...<br> - No.<br> - (IN GREEK) Look work of art!<br> - I don't want any.<br> - (IN GREEK) Only 10 drachma.<br> - Go to Hell!<br> Nothing.<br> - Do I look like a tourist?<br> - A hustler's dream.<br> I like the touch of the parasol.<br> - Genius!<br> - Come, sucker.<br> - Genuine antique?<br> - Oh, madam has a very keen eye.<br> No, it's an imitation, but of a period<br> about 1000 BC. But I've got other things.<br> I'm Arthur Simpson, the uncrowned<br> king of Kavala nightlife.<br> - I've got some Minoan cuff links...<br> - Thank you!<br> I've got some Hellenistic<br> ones of the ninth dynasty...<br> - Hey!<br> - What? You want me, sir?<br> Come to the yacht club after lunch.<br> Might have a little job for you.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Hello, Voula. Voula my doll.<br> I smell hard currency.<br> Take the plate.<br> Off home now, girl, and iron the tie.<br> - Ah, Simpson!<br> - Oh, yes, yes.<br> I know, I know, I know.<br> You wicked thing, you.<br> Here comes the schmo.<br> I'm sorry I'm late. I ran into<br> an old friend... archaeologist.<br> - We used to run an art publication.<br> - Simpson,<br> - how'd you like to earn a fast buck?<br> - Sir?<br> But if you are not interested...<br> - I am, sir.<br> - You live here?<br> Yes, well, while my own place<br> up there is being done up,<br> I'm right down... right down there.<br> You see that Lincoln?<br> Don't see many of<br> them in Kavala, sir.<br> It's been rented by a friend to<br> take to Turkey. He's going by sea.<br> - Do you know Istanbul?<br> - Turkey, oh, yes. Istanbul, yes.<br> Good. Here's what you will do. Take<br> the car to the Hilton Hotel, Istanbul.<br> - Your papers and licence in order?<br> - Oh yes, Mr... Yes, sir.<br> Here is the car key.<br> Leave it with the hotel porter.<br> Tell him the car is for Mr Plimpton.<br> Got it? Plimp-ton. P-l-i-m-p...<br> P-t-o-n. Tes.<br> They'll want the papers at the border.<br> They're in the glove department.<br> Glove department. Yes, sir.<br> Just one more little thing, Simpson.<br> This car is worth over $13,000.<br> If I don't hear from Mr<br> Plimpton by 5 o'clock tomorrow,<br> I'll report to the<br> police here. Understood?<br> That was uncalled for, sir.<br> Mr Simpson can be relied on.<br> He has a very reliable face.<br> - Thank you, Mrs...<br> - Miss.<br> Oh!<br> - Bon voyage, Mr Simpson.<br> - Godspeed, Arthur Simpson.<br> Walter, suppose they really<br> search the car at the border.<br> It could happen.<br> - Suppose they find...<br> - Finders keepers.<br> - What about Simpson?<br> - I'm afraid they will keep him, too.<br> - They'll ask him about us.<br> - So? Who is us?<br> We didn't rent the car,<br> Plimpton did, and he doesn't exist.<br> (CAR STARTING)<br> All our plans, all our hopes,<br> riding in the car with that...<br> what did you call him?<br> Schmo.<br> Schmo.<br> (SINGING)<br> Istanbul, I love you.<br> Uh-oh.<br> - Morning.<br> - Passport.<br> Morning. Mind if I watch?<br> - Mr Arthur Simpson?<br> - Mr Simpson, yes.<br> (IN TURKISH)<br> There's nothing wrong there, I hope.<br> - You are English?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Then why you have Egyptian passport?<br> That's a long story. My father<br> was a British officer... a colonel.<br> - Then why not a British passport?<br> - I'm coming to that.<br> Mummy... my mother...<br> she was Egyptian.<br> In fact, I was born<br> over there, in Egypt.<br> Cairo. Which is in... Egypt.<br> Yes?<br> Well, there was some trouble<br> with the marriage documents.<br> Troop movements. You gentlemen<br> know what it's like in the army.<br> - I know how it is in the army.<br> - Yes. The army, yes.<br> Mr Simpson,<br> this passport is not good.<br> It expired nearly three weeks ago.<br> This?<br> I'll tell you what, as soon<br> as we get to Istanbul...<br> I'm sorry, Mr Simpson.<br> You must go back to Greece.<br> Uh...<br> (IN ARABIC)<br> I do not speak Arabic.<br> Uh, officer? Officer?<br> May I have your ear<br> for a moment, please?<br> Now, you misunderstand entirely.<br> I thought that the Turks<br> were a hospitable people.<br> I know somebody who is going to have<br> something to say about this... me!<br> And another thing. I...<br> - Be careful!<br> - Don't!<br> (SHOUTING IN TURKISH)<br> (IN TURKISH)<br> - Mefkufsunuz.<br> - Mefkufsunuz?<br> - What does that mean?<br> - That means you're under arrest!<br> Mefkufsunuz.<br> - Uh...<br> - You will speak when spoken to!<br> - When did you join the Sigma group?<br> - Me?<br> - Who recruited you?<br> - Nobody.<br> - So you volunteered.<br> - No, no, please.<br> - I was hired to drive, to...<br> - Who else did the man and woman see?<br> I don't know.<br> - Did they send other arms out of Greece?<br> - No.<br> - Did they tell you?<br> - No.<br> - Then how do you know?<br> - I don't know...<br> - Why did you lie?<br> - I did not lie. I mean...<br> Simpson, be careful.<br> I am a victim of circumstances.<br> Ci...<br> I swear it.<br> Look here, I think it's time<br> you took me to my embassy.<br> - You can... you can call...<br> - Call which embassy?<br> I doubt the Egyptian authorities will<br> issue a passport to Arthur Simpson.<br> It seems there is a dossier.<br> The Egyptians bear me a grudge,<br> sir, because I claim to be British.<br> In 1958, he was deported from Britain<br> for smuggling pornographic literature.<br> An art magazine, sir.<br> Called...<br> Stop Press Nudes.<br> But may I remind you gentlemen<br> that not so very long ago,<br> James Joyce and even Lady Chatterley<br> herself were considered obscene.<br> Simpson, the penalty<br> for terrorism is death.<br> (IN TURKISH)<br> Were you going to use the roof of<br> the Hilton?
