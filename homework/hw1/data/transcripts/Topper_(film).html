I ran fast too.<br> I caught the very last step.<br> The very last step?<br> Outrageous.<br> What is outrageous about running<br> for a train, dear? Lots of men do it.<br> Yes, clerks and bookkeepers who come<br> to the depot in a bus to catch the 7:45.<br> But for the president of the<br> bank to arrive in a limousine...<br> to take the banker's special, and then to run<br> all over the platform like a silly chicken.<br> I didn't run like a silly<br> chicken. I ran beautifully.<br> Besides, you know how<br> you puff when you run.<br> Of course I puff. Everybody<br> puffs. You puff yourself, Clara.<br> I remember that day<br> - Cosmo, please. Don't be vulgar.<br> Sorry, dear. And I don't care if<br> you are well-preserved for your age.<br> You look anything but<br> dignified when you run.<br> And I won't have you climbing aboard<br> the banker's special all out of breath.<br> Good-bye, dear.<br> Bye.<br> Don't run, dear.<br> It's 8:45, Mr. Topper.<br> Morning, Mr. Topper.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning, Mr. Topper.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> You know, it is a good<br> morning too, isn't it?<br> I haven't enjoyed it though.<br> Don't you feel all right?<br> I don't feel all right. I feel<br> a million years old. You, old?<br> Why, you'll never grow<br> old, Mr. Topper. No?<br> I think you grow younger<br> every year.<br> I'd rather grow younger every<br> day. Anything special this morning?<br> No, but Mrs. Topper phoned me to be sure<br> that you go to lunch promptly at 12:00.<br> Did she tell you what I was to<br> eat? It's all right, I'll remember.<br> The directors are all waiting<br> in the board room. All of them?<br> All except Mr. Kerby.<br> He promised me faithfully-<br> He's not here. I phoned his<br> penthouse and their Long Island place.<br> Neither of them had been<br> home all night. I suppose not.<br> We'll probably have to get a detective<br> to... locate him the way we did last year.<br> If he should turn up, ask him please to<br> come in and sign the minutes at least.<br> My word! Fine place to sleep, isn't it?<br> Gentlemen, we will as usual<br> conduct our annual meeting...<br> without the presence of our<br> largest stockholder, Mr. Kerby.<br> Weather clear, track fast!<br> I made it!<br> The meeting will please<br> come to order.<br> Very gratifying to have you<br> with us, Mr. Kerby.<br> I will read the annual statement<br> that is ready for publication...<br> if approved by this board...<br> and you, Mr. Kerby.<br> Okay, shoot.<br> Shoot, huh? "Cash on hand<br> in federal reserve bank...<br> "and due from banks<br> and bankers: $660,220,262...<br> "and 99 cents.<br> Bullion abroad and in transit:<br> $13,202,854 and no cents.

I'll<br> be back in a couple of days.<br> Get a load of<br> the fur-bearing blond.<br> Good morning, Mrs. Kerby.<br> Good morning.<br> If you're looking for your husband<br> - I know where he is.<br> In there dummying up<br> the directors' meeting.<br> But if you happen to see him looking for<br> someone, remind him that it's me, will you?<br> And tell him where I am.<br> Oh, my goodness.

I don't understand why.<br> Look, try it.<br> You try writing your name upside<br> down and backwards without stopping.<br> Here.<br> I move we adjourn.<br> I second the motion.<br> Aye.<br> Carried.

"<br> No sense. George Kerby's a nitwit<br> if ever I saw one. Confound him.<br> Psst!<br> Don't "psst" at me.<br> Go ahead and "psst" at him.<br> I think it's cute. Why, I-I<br> didn't know you were here.<br> Oh, don't apologize.<br> If you're confounding George,<br> I think you're absolutely right.<br> But you only have to put up with him once a<br> year. Think of me. I have to live with him.<br> I like it so, but<br> - Please don't misunderstand. I like George.<br> I- I'm very fond of him.<br> And he's fond of you too.<br> In fact, we both are.<br> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<br> No, please, no.<br> Uh, uh, that'll be all,<br> Miss Johnson.<br> You know, Topper, you were awfully silly<br> not to come to our anniversary party.<br> It was a swell one.<br> Laughter for days.<br> In fact, I think it's-<br> it might be still going on.<br> I bet it was fun, yeah.<br> But-But Mrs. -<br> Mrs. Topper... doesn't approve.<br> She- We had<br> another engagement.<br> You understand, don't you?<br> Yes, I'm afraid I do.<br> Why don't you stop being a mummy<br> for a few minutes and come to life?<br> There's nothing wrong in being a mummy<br> if you had any fun in getting that way-<br> But I- I didn't, you see.<br> No, I can tell that by the<br> way you're staring at my knees.<br> Why, I-I never stared<br> at a knee in my life.<br> That's probably just<br> what's wrong with you.<br> Of course, I... I suppose I do envy<br> the way you and George do things.<br> But it would never do for me,<br> for a man in my position.<br> Then as Mrs. Topper says-<br> Ah, as Mrs. Topper says.<br> That's the situation<br> and the box it came in.<br> Oh. Oh.<br> Hello, honey. Never mind. I<br> found her. She's running the bank.<br> Huh?<br> George, look.<br> What's the matter with him? He's old<br> enough to know what's the matter with him.<br> "Liabilities, no cents,<br> assets. "<br> Topper, I know just the thing<br> for the two of us. Where is it?<br> But something's biting the man, eating<br> him from the inside. Maybe termites.<br> What sort of a woman is Mrs.<br> Topper? Don't tell me. I'll guess.<br> Is she the horsey type? No.<br> The tennis type? No.<br> I know. She's the kin type.<br> Arranges your diets, fixes your clothes,<br> tells you what you'll eat and where you'll go.<br> Well, to a certain extent,<br> yes. Where do you keep it?<br> Keep what? The bottle. Don't<br> tell me there isn't a bottle here?<br> Of course there isn't a bottle.<br> This is a business office.<br> Business is all right, but don't you<br> think that's carrying business too far?<br> Come on. Let's roll.<br> I don't wanna leave Topper.<br> Somehow I feel if I could pull him<br> apart, I could put him together...<br> and he'd work much better.<br> Catch.<br> Topper, take my advice. Don't let<br> her make a guinea pig out of you.<br> You'll never be the same again.<br> So long.<br> Hmm. Mrs. Kerby's handkerchief.<br> Oh. Thank you.<br> I'm ready, Mr. Topper.<br> Hmm. Yes, yes.<br> H. Greg & Company, 80<br> Milk Street, Boston, Mass.<br> Dear sir. Yours is<br> the ninth received and-<br> Fascinating woman,<br> Marion Kerby, isn't she?<br> She reminds me of an Easter egg<br> I had as a small boy.<br> - An Easter egg?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Those frosty ones, you know, with a peephole<br> in it. You looked through and saw an angel.<br> I wonder why Marion Kerby<br> reminds me of an angel.<br> Uh, yes, where were we?<br> Maybe we'd better<br> start over.<br> The angel was a blond too.<br> You're driving us crazy way out here. I<br> mean, you're crazy to drive us way out here.<br> We could be at the apartment<br> sleeping our ears off.<br> The apartment's too close to<br> that bank. It's in the same city.<br> Why do you pick on the bank?<br> It doesn't pick on you.<br> That stuffed egg that runs it<br> does. Stuffed eggs, I love 'em.<br> You never know what's in 'em<br> till you take a bite.<br> Take a bite out of Topper for<br> me once and crack your teeth.<br> Why do you love him so? 'Cause he bores<br> me stiff. He's like a successful sheep.<br> Don't say that. Topper has very<br> interesting possibilities, maybe.<br> Well, so does a sheep. It can<br> be chopped or hash or soup.<br> Hash, Topper. That fits,<br> doesn't it, George?<br> Offhand, I'd say, what are you<br> talking about? Hash, Topper.<br> You know, all mixed up. All he needs<br> is straightening out, and I can do it.<br> Yes. The last time you tried straightening<br> a guy out, you cost me ten grand.<br> Not this time.<br> The foot's down.<br> If you ask me, I'd say<br> it was down too far.<br> I nearly skinned my eyebrows<br> on the trees that time.<br> My pet, if you were driving the<br> car, there wouldn't be any trees.<br> You'd have plowed 'em up. You remember<br> what happened to the last car we had?<br> Sure. You drove it into a meat<br> market. No, the one before that.<br> Well, I can't remember that<br> far back. George, look out.<br> What? There's something in<br> my eye. Something in your eye?<br> Be careful! Look out!<br> You'll never make it, George!<br> Oh, boy.<br> I guess I'll never hear<br> the last of this.<br> Oh, look at my car.<br> Look at my hat.<br> And I got a run<br> in my stockings.<br> Look at that.<br> I told you to slow up.<br> Would you? Oh, no.<br> Can I help it if a tire blows out?<br> Besides, I had something in my eye.<br> Couldn't have been<br> your driving, could it?<br> I've come around that curb much<br> faster lots of times. So have you.<br> It was such<br> a lovely car too.<br> Oh, George!<br> Hmm?<br> You're getting transparent.<br> You're fading.<br> Say, that's funny.<br> I can see through you too.<br> Say, who's that?<br> That's us.<br> You know something, George?<br> I think we're dead.<br> I think you're right.<br> It's funny,<br> I don't feel any different.<br> No, neither do I.<br> Now I wonder<br> what happens.<br> I don't know.<br> I suppose pretty soon we'll hear<br> trumpets, and then off we go.<br> I hope we go together, honey.<br> So do I.<br> No trumpets.<br> No, no trumpets.<br> Marion,<br> what do you suppose is the<br> conventional thing to do now?<br> I don't know.<br> We've never<br> been conventional.<br> I think we tell someone<br> our good deeds,<br> and then they open up the<br> beautiful gates and let us through.<br> Yes, but what good deeds<br> have you done?<br> Oh, dozens.<br> Name one.<br> Well, I've, uh-<br> Mm-hmm.<br> I've, uh-<br> Hey, what good deeds<br> have you done?<br> Well, I-<br> At least we haven't<br> done any bad ones, honey.<br> Yes, but that's<br> not enough, and-<br> and I'm afraid<br> it's too late now.<br> Yes.<br> And I'm afraid that<br> for once in our, uh-<br> Well, for once,<br> we're stuck.<br> George, maybe not.<br> Hmm?<br> Maybe if we could do<br> a good deed now, and-<br> Oh, George!<br> You're fading.<br> Didn't you think the lamb was especially<br> good? Yes, of course it was good.<br> Why must we always have lamb on<br> Sundays? You like lamb, don't you?<br> Yes, I like it, but couldn't we have it<br> on some other day? Say Tuesday or Thursday.<br> We have beef on Tuesday and<br> boiled vegetables on Thursday.<br> Oh, sparrows!<br> Why do you use<br> that silly word?<br> Because you won't let me<br> swear like a gentleman.<br> Cosmo, what has come<br> over you lately?<br> You've been acting<br> so strange and moody.<br> - Not at all like your usual self.<br> - I don't know.<br> Ever since the Kerby tragedy,<br> I've been thinking.<br> Clara, life is so very short, and<br> we get so very little out of it.<br> Don't you realize,<br> we're mile age?<br> But why should<br> we be mile age?<br> After all, we're not so very<br> much older than the Kerbys were.<br> And look how carefree they were,<br> how full of life.<br> I can hardly realize<br> they've gone.<br> Poor George.<br> Poor Marion.<br> Poor Marion?<br> Mmm.<br> Of course, I never saw her,<br> but from what I've heard of her,<br> she never thought of<br> anything in her whole life...<br> except how to paint her pretty<br> face and wag her figure about.<br> Oh, yes, she did.<br> She used to think about me.<br> Oh, don't be foolish.<br> I shuer to think what kind of a ninny<br> you'd make if you didn't have me to stop you.<br> There's a man outside, sir.<br> He wishes to see you about a<br> - a contraption he's brought with him.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Well, here she is,<br> Mr. Topper.<br> Just as good as the day<br> she was bought.<br> I've got a list of the things<br> I've done to her.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Now, you see here,<br> I put in a brand-new<br> front axle.<br> No use trying<br> to repair them things.<br> Well, she's something,<br> isn't it?<br> How much you think<br> we could sell it for?<br> Well, it's pretty hard<br> to tell, Mr. Topper.<br> It ain't like trying<br> to sell just any car.<br> You gotta find the right party. You mean,<br> someone who hasn't heard of the wreck.<br> Yeah, that too.<br> Some people are superstitious.<br> I mean, somebody who will fit it,<br> kind of. What do you mean, "fit it"?<br> Well, like, uh - Well, take yourself. You<br> could never own a car like this.<br> No, I suppose not.<br> Why couldn't I?<br> Well, uh,<br> for one thing, the missus, she don't<br> care for anything flashy, does she?<br> Mrs. Topper runs the household,<br> and very efficiently too.<br> But when it comes<br> to buying cars-<br> Of course I never wanted<br> to buy a car like this, but...<br> if I did want to buy<br> a car like this, I'd, uh-<br> I'd buy a car like this.<br> How do I look? Oh, you<br> look swell, Mr. Topper.<br> You bet I do.<br> I fit it too.<br> Fit it just like<br> a kid glove, you know.<br> Oh, for heaven's sake,<br> Cosmo!<br> What are you doing in that horrible contrap<br> - that horrible thing?<br> Sitting in it, dear.<br> Just sitting.<br> Just sitting?<br> You look like a whatnot.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I- I'm thinking of buying it.<br> Buying it?<br> Buying that-that circus wagon?<br> Well, of all the absurd-<br> Cosmo, you must be dithering.<br> I thought it'd be fun to drive my own car<br> - weekends, anyways.<br> Of course, I suppose you're old<br> enough to know your own mind, but-<br> Clara, we used to play together<br> once, and we could again.<br> We could - We could drive up to<br> Lake Placid, just you and I.<br> Stop at a roadhouse,<br> and dinner and dance-<br> You're asking me to drive in a car<br> that looks like a painted Jezebel?<br> And drive in it<br> to a roadhouse?<br> Why, it would be like going<br> to the opera in my nightgown.<br> Painted Jezebel, eh?<br> So I'm a ditherer.<br> Well, I'm jolly well<br> gonna dither then.<br> Would you mind<br> getting off my wife's lap?<br> Who said that?<br> Olley, olley, oxen free.<br> Stop it. My nerves<br> are jumpy enough already.<br> Where are you?<br> Hey, get off my foot.<br> Who are you?<br> Where are you?<br> I'm in no mood<br> for this sort of thing.<br> Come out in the open<br> where I can see you.<br> Toppy doesn't know us<br> Toppy doesn't know us<br> Mrs. Kerby,<br> may I present Mr. Topper.<br> How do you do, Mr. Topper?<br> How-How-How do you do?<br> And this is Mr. Kerby,<br> Mr. Topper.<br> Uh, how-how do you-<br> George and<br> Marion Kerby? Why-<br> It can't be.<br> It- It mustn't be.<br> It is.<br> Oh, dear, dear. Topper's<br> fainted. Get some water, Marion.<br> Water.<br> Come on, Topper.<br> Oh, that's fine.<br> You're a great help.<br> My hat!<br> Oh, no, no, it can't be.<br> It- No, no, no-<br> I'm gonna get in my car<br> and drive home.<br> No, Topper.<br> Sit down, Topper.<br> You can't get in your car and drive<br> home because you've got a flat tire.<br> Besides, it isn't your car.<br> It's ours.<br> I'll walk. You can have the car. Mrs. Topper<br> doesn't like the horrible thing anyway.<br> George, did you hear that? Mrs.<br> Topper doesn't like the car.<br> Our good deed. Let's get to<br> work on him. What do you mean?<br> Never mind. Why doesn't Mrs. Topper like<br> the car? She just plain doesn't like it.<br> She often just plain doesn't like<br> things. What kind of talk is that?<br> She just plain doesn't<br> like things.<br> I refuse to say another word. I'm<br> probably talking to myself anyway.<br> Well, like that. We find you<br> fainting all over the place.<br> We nurse you back to health, and still<br> you're complaining. I want to go home!<br> No, Topper, you can't go home.<br> Besides, George has to change the tire.<br> And he's very good at<br> it too. Go ahead, honey.<br> All right,<br> I'll change the tire.<br> But I'll be darned if I'm gonna<br> waste any ectoplasm doing it.<br> You see, Toppy, we only have a certain<br> amount of ectoplasm to use to get visible.<br> Naturally, we can't waste<br> it, can we? Of course not, no.<br> No, I- I wish someone<br> would wake me up.<br> Now, now, Toppy,<br> I won't bite you.<br> Let's sit over there<br> by the tree and be comfortable.<br> We might as well be comfortable while<br> George works, don't you think so? Come on.<br> Come on.<br> You sit there<br> and I'll relax here.<br> You know, Toppy, you're<br> a funny little fellow.<br> You intrigue me. Why did<br> you happen to buy our car?<br> - I bought it because I was mad.<br> Who at?<br> - Never mind.<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.<br> - Toppy had a fight with Mrs. Toppy.<br> - I did not!<br> Come on. Tell the girlfriend<br> all about it.<br> - What girlfriend?<br> - Yours. Me.<br> Say, you don't mind if I save my energy<br> and just become nothing for a while, do you?<br> I don't suppose I do. I don't<br> know what you're talking about.<br> Dematerializing. Watch.<br> It works like a zipper.<br> Zip!<br> Marion!<br> Marion, where are you?<br> Right here.<br> What? Oh.<br> Well, make a noise every<br> now and then, will you,<br> so that I'll know<br> where I'm talking to?<br> Okay, I'll do this.<br> Yes, fine.<br> Now, go on. Tell me<br> about buying the car.<br> Oh, well, I- I just<br> decided I'd buy it, you know.<br> I had an awful time with it at<br> first, because I was going along...<br> and then a great big truck came<br> along and chased me off the road.<br> And then I was just getting over<br> that when a huge bus came along...<br> and-and chased me off<br> the side of the hill like-<br> Hey, watch out!<br> Oh, I beg your pardon.<br> Well, then-<br> then I was going along...<br> peacefully, you know,<br> and suenly-<br> bam- I was slapped by a-<br> Just explaining something<br> to a friend of mine.<br> Is it my fault<br> that there's no one here?<br> Quiet.<br> The iron-bound bucket<br> The moss-covered bucket<br> That hangs in the well<br> Hey, Marion!<br> Come out, come out, wherever<br> you are. I've got an idea.<br> When George has an idea, it<br> is, generally speaking, an idea.<br> Bring Topper along. We'll go<br> places. I don't want to go places.<br> I've been to places, lots<br> of places. Really, I have.<br> Oh, but not with us. It's different<br> when you go places with us.<br> Bring him along, Marion! We gotta<br> have him. He's our good deed.<br> Come on, Toppy.<br> You drive, George. I'll sit in the<br> mile. Come on, Topper. Get in.<br> Don't you think I better drive? It'd look<br> so crazy to other people if you drive.<br> Now, come on.<br> Don't be a mess. Get in.<br> Close your door, Topper.<br> Look out!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> There was no one driving that car.<br> Oh, you're crazy. I'm not<br> crazy. I know what I saw.<br> The car was driving itself.<br> If you ask me, so was this one.<br> All right, I'll prove it for<br> you. Well, you'll have to!<br> I wish you'd stop this nonsense<br> and let yourselves be seen,<br> or- or let me drive.<br> Okay.<br> Slide over.<br> Now what have you<br> got to say?<br> I know when I'm licked.<br> Where am I taking you?<br> You're not taking us.<br> We're taking you.<br> Marion, it's bad enough just being in<br> the car with you two the way you are.<br> Well, the way you aren't.<br> Where are we going?<br> Unless you rented it to someone,<br> we're going to our penthouse.<br> Heavens! No,<br> I haven't rented it.<br> And we can have a drink. George<br> hasn't had a drink in days.<br> He looks much better than<br> he used to, don't you think?<br> How in heaven's name should<br> I know? Hey, stop pushing.<br> Don't push me!<br> I didn't push you. And if<br> I did push you, what of it?<br> Oh, a wise guy, huh?<br> Like those crazy Kerbys.<br> Crazy Kerbys, huh?<br> Wise guy, eh?<br> I wish you'd do something<br> about yourselves.<br> You have no idea how annoying it is to be out<br> with someone and you don't know where they are.<br> Okay, my friend,<br> anything to oblige.<br> Here we are, Topper. The Kerby Kennel.<br> Barking, howling and biting permissible.<br> Come in.<br> Where's Marion? Gone to her room,<br> I guess. You know how women are.<br> When they get home, they like to change<br> clothes, mess around, blither, blither.<br> You drink? I did once,<br> but it wasn't much fun.<br> Nobody noticed it. It made me dizzy<br> and I had to keep one eye shut.<br> Oh, well,<br> you had the floats.<br> I like 'em. Make you<br> feel nice and goofy.<br> Maybe I do need a drink. Maybe I've needed<br> a drink all these years and haven't known it.<br> There we are. Hold it.<br> Topper, my pet.<br> Thank you.<br> Mmm!<br> My wife objects to drinking.<br> Then she shouldn't drink.<br> She doesn't.<br> - Then what's her objections?<br> - If my wife were to walk in here right now,<br> I'd have to speak to her very sharply<br> in order to keep her from making a row.<br> Speak to her? Yes, I've<br> - I've never beaten her.<br> Not yet, I haven't.<br> Oh.<br> Open the other bottle.<br> Crazy Kerbys, eh?<br> Plush pup!<br> Thanks, George.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Do- Do you feel<br> like dancing?<br> Do I feel like what?<br> Oh.<br> You know what I mean. Dancing and singing and<br> - Say that again.<br> Well, George,<br> dancing, singing.<br> Tra-la-la, tra-la-la With a<br> hey, nonny-nonny and a whoo-<br> Relax, Topper, relax. Take<br> a drink. Stop fidgeting.<br> Oh.<br> Do you mind if I just sat here<br> and sort of sneak a little dance...<br> with my feet?<br> Cut it out.<br> Cut it out, will ya?<br> What if I just sat quietly here<br> and-and felt like dancing?<br> That'd be all right,<br> wouldn't it?<br> Look, what is this<br> dancing complex?<br> Look here,<br> would you mind if<br> I just got up and danced...<br> a roundabout...<br> on my tiptoes?<br> All right-<br> All right, if you must.<br> Go ahead, but take it easy.<br> Toppy, I think you got something<br> there. Hit it. Truck on down, Toppy.<br> Now that's how I dance.<br> How do you like it?<br> Yes, I thought<br> that was pretty bad.<br> I'm glad you like<br> my dancing, George.<br> I think I could learn how<br> to live after all, you know.<br> I can drink, all right.<br> And I can dance fine.<br> Now, about singing, hmm.<br> Let's sing a little, huh?<br> Yes, that's a good idea.<br> Let's sing.<br> Uh-huh.<br> Oh, there she is, George.<br> Where?<br> Topper, you look<br> like an owl.<br> Come here, George.<br> Huh?<br> I'm afraid I must ask you to request<br> your wife not to talk about me anymore.<br> Tsk, tsk, tsk.<br> Use your influence.<br> If you haven't any,<br> beat her.<br> Come on down, Marion.<br> All right.<br> Alley!<br> Oop.<br> Ta-rah<br> Topper, you did that<br> on purpose. Nice going.<br> I'm dreadfully sorry.<br> I forgive you, Topper.<br> Nice forgiving too.<br> Can we dance now? Why, certainly.<br> That's what I got off my perch for.<br> Oh, the moss-covered-<br> d<br> Hangs in the well d<br> It's a fine thing,<br> trying to steal my wife, eh?<br> Why, I wouldn't think of such a thing, I<br> - I don't think.<br> Ah, Topper,<br> I'm disappointed in you.<br> Say, if I'm in the way, you<br> folks can leave. Oh, not at all.<br> Mighty nice of you to let me<br> stay around. What's biting you?<br> You're not getting<br> jealous, are you?<br> N- No. No, just<br> getting careful.<br> Say, listen.<br> What?<br> All I'm trying to do is to<br> complete our little experiment.<br> Yes, well, I don't know if I<br> like it. Well, that's too bad.<br> Grab a look at<br> your little experiment now.<br> We're not really being<br> very fair to him.<br> I don't think he knows<br> how to drink.<br> But he only had<br> a couple glasses of wine.<br> But I don't think he's ever<br> had a drink in his life.<br> Poor Topper.<br> Poor Topper.<br> Poor Topper.<br> You keep out of this.<br> Say, George, you know something? What?<br> I think fate sent him to us. I think<br> we ought to send him right back.<br> Oh, no. He looks like our<br> last chance at a good deed.<br> That's how he looks to you.<br> Well, look at him.<br> His whole soul is crying out<br> for self-expression.<br> Is that so?<br> Is that the way a soul looks when<br> it's crying out for self-expression?<br> Maybe. Maybe Topper's soul. Anyway, all<br> he needs is a little encouragement from us.<br> If you really wanna do him a good deed, get<br> him some bromo while I go change my clothes.<br> Hold down the fort, honey,<br> while I dissolve into a suit.<br> George, where is it?<br> Huh? Where's what?<br> Where?<br> Where what?<br> The bromo, you know.<br> Well, then give him some.<br> Then he'll just have<br> to have aspirin instead.<br> Oh, never mind. Let it go.<br> I'll be down in a minute.<br> Hmm, it moved.<br> We're fresh out of bromo.<br> Then put on your bonnet. We'll go<br> down to the drugstore and get him some.<br> Come on, Topper. Mm-hmm.<br> Dear, dear. Marion, come and<br> hold him here while I get my hat.<br> All right.<br> Oh, George, quick!<br> Trying to get away, huh?<br> Come on, Topper. Don't<br> drop him or he'll splash.<br> Now, now, Toppy, relax,<br> relax. Take it easy.<br> There he goes again.<br> Upsa-daisy, Toppy.<br> Say, George. We can't go<br> down the lobby like this.<br> We'll cause a riot. Fade.<br> Okay.<br> Don't teeter, Topper.<br> For heaven's sake! What's<br> the matter with that man?<br> Why- Why-<br> Why doesn't he fall?<br> What's the idea<br> of stealing my elevator?<br> We haven't got<br> your elevator, silly.<br> Huh?<br> I never wear them.<br> What do you mean by insulting<br> a guest? Well, he was-<br> You're fired!<br> Thank you, Toppy.<br> I've got a beehive in my<br> stomach, but don't mention it.<br> There's the bud now. Ask him what<br> make she is. Yeah, she's a beaut.<br> So that's the babe you've been talking<br> about. She'd be a cinch to handle.<br> No gentlemen would talk about a lady<br> like that, and I demand an apology.<br> You gonna... apologize?<br> Ah, you're daffy.<br> Why, you!<br> Let's go, Marion!<br> Get in.<br> Hey, there's the little<br> creep now! Get him!<br> What's going on here?<br> One at a time.<br> One at a time!<br> Now, who hit who?<br> He hit us!<br> Oh, he hit us?<br> Yeah!<br> One man attacking the whole<br> gang? The other two helped him.<br> What other two? Where<br> are they? In there.<br> Now don't try to be funny!<br> You, what happened?<br> That's right, Officer. He started<br> it, then his two friends jumped in.<br> What two friends? Where<br> are they? They got in there.<br> Then the other two jumped out of the<br> car and started slugging me from behind!<br> Hold on now.<br> Wait a minute!<br> Now then, what other two?<br> Holy cats! They're gone!<br> All right, all right!<br> Now look, mister, maybe you<br> can tell me what happened.<br> Me?<br> Yeah.<br> I wanna sing.<br> This one wants to sing.<br> All right, Danny. Come on.<br> Let's take 'em all in.<br> Sit down there.<br> People v. Cosmo Topper.<br> Say, were you guys in the same<br> fight with him? I'll say we were.<br> Who is he? He's a big-shot<br> banker from Wall Street.<br> What'd he do? For no reason, he<br> hangs a haymaker on Eie's kisser.<br> A charge of being drunk and disorderly,<br> attacking a peaceful citizen...<br> and inciting a riot.<br> I'll tidy you up a little.<br> Brush him off, George,<br> while I fix his hanky. Okay.<br> There are four serious-<br> Just a nervous eccentricity, Your Honor.<br> It sometimes gets the better of me.<br> There are four serious<br> charges here, Mr. Topper.<br> I presume you wish to plead not<br> guilty and tell your side of the story.<br> On the contrary, Your Honor, I wish<br> to plead guilty and get it over with.<br> Well, in that case, you leave me no<br> alternative except to fine you $100.<br> Why, that's outrageous!<br> - What's that?<br> I- I said,<br> where do you pay us?<br> I mean,<br> where do you pay it?<br> Right there. Next case.<br> But the dame, wow! A dame? What<br> did she look like? Who is she?<br> A burlesque queen or something.<br> Swell-lookin' doll, but plenty tough.<br> Next case.<br> All right, boys,<br> out of the way.<br> Is everything<br> all right, Wilkins?<br> I should say, sir, though it's not my<br> place, that everything is quite all wrong.<br> In fact, I might even go so far as to a<br> that you have become a legend before your time.<br> Has-Has Mrs. Topper<br> heard about last night?<br> Mrs. Topper, sir,<br> has read about last night.<br> It's four minutes past 8:00.<br> I know, I know. We dress now.<br> Good morning, dear.<br> Good morning, Cosmo.<br> I'm late.<br> Your egg, sir.<br> Oh.<br> Your toast, sir.<br> Well, I- I mean, go on.<br> Let's get it over.<br> Cosmo, I've been<br> a good wife to you.<br> I've helped you climb to<br> the top in the business world...<br> and I certainly<br> raised you socially.<br> I married you<br> for better or for worse.<br> And if you see fit to drag<br> yourself and me in the gutter-<br> Oh, Clara, please.<br> Of course, you realize we'll have to<br> face the world without any friends.<br> No one with any self-respect will<br> ever cross our threshold again.<br> And you had to pick<br> this particular time too.<br> Well, I- I don't understand<br> just what you mean...<br> about "this particular<br> time," Marion.<br> I had every good reason to<br> believe that the Stuyvesants...<br> were going to ask us<br> to their next big party.<br> The Stuyvesants.<br> Oh, of course.<br> Yes, I know you<br> - you wanted to be asked there for years.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> Don't be sorry, Cosmo.<br> What's done is done.<br> And I will do my part...<br> to save what little I can from<br> the wreck you've made of our lives.<br> - 8:42, sir.<br> - Oh. Oh, dear.<br> Yes, madam?<br> Is Mrs. Topper home?<br> Who shall I say is calling?<br> Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant.<br> Mrs. Ruther-<br> Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant? Oh.<br> Come in, madam.<br> Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant calling,<br> madam. Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant.<br> Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant!<br> Oh, good gracious, Wilkins,<br> you must be mistaken.<br> No, madam. Shall I-<br> Oh, yes, of course.<br> Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant.<br> Well, so you're Mrs. Topper.<br> I just dropped in to ask you and that<br> delicious husband of yours to come to dinner...<br> next Friday night<br> before our little dance.<br> Why, we- Why, I-<br> Oh, I do owe you an apology. I<br> should have called on you years ago,<br> but I didn't know whether you<br> would approve of our little crowd.<br> Approve? Oh, my dear.<br> Well, you see, I understood you<br> like to lead a quiet, simple life.<br> But after reading about Mr.<br> Topper's delightful escapade-<br> Mrs. Goodrich<br> and Mrs. Simpkins.<br> Well.<br> Hello, Grace.<br> I saw your car outside<br> and thought I'd just pop in.<br> We've been so anxious to meet you. I'm<br> sure we must have a great deal in common.<br> Thank you. I'm sure.<br> How do you do?<br> What a divine life our Mrs. Topper must<br> live. She must have a thrill a minute.<br> Living with Mr. Topper must<br> be like dancing on dynamite.<br> My goodness. That's not<br> a very good picture of him.<br> Well, bless my blond heart.<br> I never expected Mousy to break<br> out in this kind of a heat wave.<br> Could, uh,<br> I borrow your lipstick?<br> Sure.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh.<br> Dreaming it up, huh?<br> Good morning, Mr. Topper.<br> Beautiful day, isn't it?<br> No. Uh, yes, I meant.<br> Good morning, Mr. Topper.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning!<br> Good morning.<br> Well, good morning, Mr.<br> Topper. Good morning.<br> What's the matter with you,<br> Miss Johnson? Stop gaping at me.<br> I'm not a monster,<br> in spite of the papers.<br> What's the matter with everybody?<br> Respectable bankers like J.D.,<br> who oughta frown on me, slapped me on<br> the back and asked me if she has a friend.<br> I- I can't understand it.<br> Take a letter, please.<br> Mr. Wilson P. Hemmingway,<br> Buffalo, New York.<br> Dear sir,<br> Your collateral is satisfactory,<br> and this corporation is prepared<br> to finance your proposition 100%.<br> It will of course be necessary for<br> you to deposit the bonds with us.<br> Stop goggling, Miss Johnson.<br> To resume.<br> I would suggest that<br> you come to New York...<br> at your earliest convenience.<br> Really, Miss Johnson. You seem<br> to be staring at my hat...<br> as though you thought there was<br> something dreadful the matter with it.<br> I do. Yes, well, then I think<br> perhaps you better take the day off...<br> and do whatever you do do<br> on your day off.<br> Perhaps I'd better had.<br> Yes.<br> All right, George, you win.<br> But I - I do think you might<br> show a little respect for the bank.<br> Don't push me!<br> Where are you?<br> What-<br> Marion wants a soda.<br> Oh.<br> So it's you, Marion.<br> After all the things<br> you've done to me,<br> you want me to buy you a<br> soda? Mm-hmm. A chocolate one.<br> Don't you understand that<br> this is my private office?<br> But all I want is a chocolate soda<br> with some vanilla ice cream in it.<br> Why doesn't George buy you<br> one? 'Cause he's wandered off.<br> Besides,<br> he doesn't like sodas.<br> And, Toppy,<br> I'm lonely anyway.<br> Haven't you any friends?<br> None that I like<br> as well as you.<br> Don't you do that again,<br> ever!<br> Supposing George were<br> watching us. But he isn't.<br> Well, how do I know he's not? You'll<br> just have to take my word for it.<br> Now stop being difficult.<br> Come on.<br> Here's your hat and here's your<br> stick. Here are your gloves.<br> Marion wants a nice-<br> I know.<br> You want a chocolate soda with<br> vanilla ice cream. Mm-hmm. Do I get it?<br> Not for a million dollars.<br> Oh, so you're gonna be mean?<br> All right. I can be just<br> as stubborn as you are.<br> I won't budge from here.<br> I know what I'll do.<br> I'll- I'll scream.<br> You wouldn't dare.<br> Oh, wouldn't I, though?<br> Help! Stop it! I'll do anything<br> you like, but don't do that.<br> All right, then. Come<br> on. Shut that door.<br> You can't go out like that. What<br> will the people in the office think?<br> Well, supposing<br> I go out like this?<br> All right, go on.<br> Why, shame on you,<br> biting little children.<br> What's going on here?<br> Oh!<br> I wanna stop here.<br> Don't do that, Marion.<br> You nearly wrecked us.<br> I'll be out before<br> you can say "Jack Robinson. "<br> Only don't say it<br> for a few minutes.<br> Don't talk.<br> Someone will hear you.<br> Don't look now, Toppy, but there's<br> some lip rouge on your cheek.<br> Huh? Oh, yes.<br> This is delightful.<br> You wait here<br> and I'll go and investigate.<br> Marion, wh-what are you<br> up to now?<br> Here I am, Toppy.<br> Oh!<br> Marion, you-you promised to be<br> good, and... now look at you.<br> - Don't you dare go away<br> without me.<br> Why, I didn't see<br> anything unusual, no.<br> Well, maybe it was the<br> wind. Maybe you're right.<br> Cosmo?<br> Come right in here.<br> For heaven's sake, what are you<br> doing home at this time of day?<br> I ran away. I<br> - I mean, I thought it would be nice...<br> to feel how it would be to be<br> here during the daytime, you know.<br> I really can't understand<br> these women. They-<br> But, really. But women like Mrs.<br> Stuyvesant and Mrs. Goodrich.<br> Never before have they<br> - You can forget it if you wanted to.<br> And if you really cared for me, there are a<br> whole lot of things you could forget about.<br> Forget? What do you mean, forget? Yes.<br> Well, I know that the newspaper<br> said awful things about me,<br> but, you know, I'm not<br> that sort of a man, really.<br> I'm- I'm just<br> an old faithful dog.<br> That's all.<br> Uh-oh.<br> Old faithful dog?<br> Cosmo, I can't stand here and let<br> you flaunt your infidelity in my face.<br> But, Clara<br> - Don't speak. Don't try to explain.<br> It's all perfectly clear. But-But-But<br> I bought them for you as a surprise.<br> A surprise?<br> It's a shock!<br> No one - No one but a horrid woman<br> would wear a thing like this.<br> Oh, Cosmo!<br> Clara,<br> I'm so terribly sorry...<br> about those-<br> about those things.<br> I- Please let me in,<br> darling, won't you?<br> Go away.<br> Go away,<br> wicked old man.<br> I beg your pardon, sir, but<br> are we packing? I'mpacking.<br> Are we going away, sir?<br> I'mgoing away.<br> Can't you even look<br> like a human being?<br> I don't know, sir. I've never<br> tried. Well, you'd better try.<br> Now, sir?<br> Why not?<br> No. Better go back to the<br> old way, I think. Yes, sir.<br> And when shall I say<br> you'll be back, sir?<br> Say, "I don't know. " I don't know<br> where I'm going. I don't know where I am.<br> I don't know anything. Say anything<br> that pops into your fat, stupid head.<br> And lo, the worm turns.<br> Ah, well.<br> I thought perhaps<br> a cup of tea would help.<br> That's very kind of you. I<br> don't want any tea, Wilkins.<br> And I won't be down<br> for dinner.<br> I- I couldn't bear<br> the thought of facing him.<br> That won't be necessary, madam.<br> Mr. Topper has gone.<br> Gone? Gone where?<br> He didn't know.<br> He didn't know?<br> But that's ridiculous. Nobody can go<br> away and not know where they've gone.<br> Nobody can.<br> Wilkins, after all these years,<br> are you trying to be funny?<br> No, madam. Mr. Topper<br> went with a suitcase...<br> in the contraption.<br> He's left me.<br> I'll never see him again.<br> Oh, no, madam.<br> He'll come back.<br> If you'll pardon the liberty,<br> madam, he'll come back...<br> just to find out whether you've<br> missed him or not whilst he was away.<br> They always do.<br> Of course I'll miss him.<br> But he mustn't know that,<br> madam.<br> What difference does it make?<br> Even if he does come back,<br> I can never<br> hope to hold him.<br> That woman- He-<br> He doesn't want me anymore.<br> He- He wants these.<br> Did you say he wanted<br> those, madam? Yes, I-I did.<br> Then why not let him<br> have them? I don't-<br> I don't mean<br> just these things.<br> I mean-<br> Oh, Wilkins.<br> He's mad about<br> the sort of creature who-<br> the sort of woman<br> who wears these things.<br> But, my dear, dear madam,<br> might I suggest that...<br> you could so easily be the alluring<br> sort of woman who wears those?<br> Oh, confound it, madam. I still say if<br> he wants the pants, let him have them.<br> Oh! Wilkins!<br> How dare you-<br> Wilk-<br> Have a bite, Toppy.<br> Marion!<br> That's for<br> running away from me.<br> I'm mad at you. Well, why don't<br> you go away? Leave me alone.<br> Oh, I'm not that mad. But I ask<br> you, do you think it was very nice...<br> to run away from me?<br> Oh, don't let's talk about it<br> anymore. I've had enough of it.<br> I've had enough<br> of everything.<br> Oh, Toppy,<br> don't be mad at me.<br> Where are we going? I<br> don't know. I've left home.<br> Doesn't matter where I go.<br> Oh!<br> Then I'll tell you<br> what let's do.<br> Let's go to the Sea Breeze<br> Hotel. It's right on this road.<br> Is it?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> We can swim and play<br> and dance every night.<br> There's a wonderful orchestra<br> there. Oh, it'll be fun.<br> Swim and play<br> and dance every night, eh?<br> I bet it would-<br> What am I talking about?<br> I'm a married man. I can't<br> go gallivanting off with a-<br> Oh, Toppy,<br> you'll be fine.<br> Well, we won't go.<br> Look here, Marion, if you're<br> here I'm gonna be very angry.<br> In fact, I am angry now. I won't<br> have you upsetting me all the time.<br> Of course I'm here. You didn't<br> suppose I'd leave my Toppy, did you?<br> Be careful.<br> Here comes the bellboy.<br> Take this bag, will you?<br> Why are you staring at me like-like-<br> like something? I don't know.<br> Aren't you the guy<br> that cost me my last job?<br> Never saw you before<br> in my life.<br> Hey, did you notice something<br> funny about that guy?<br> That guy ain't funny.<br> He ain't even human.<br> Then I'll take charge<br> of this.<br> Call for Miss White, please.<br> Calling Miss White.<br> How do you do?<br> We have a nice room<br> on the third floor.<br> Third floor. That'll do very<br> nicely, thank you. Any floor.<br> Take this gentleman to<br> Did you see what I saw?<br> Did I see what, Sherlock?<br> Nothin'.<br> Are you always this anxious<br> at getting a hotel room?<br> I have a reason for being anxious<br> to get into this room in a hurry.<br> Well, I have a reason to get<br> out of this room in a hurry.<br> Come on. Let me out. Go on.<br> Here.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Here. Here. Go on. Get<br> out. I wanna shut the door.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> Between you and that guy<br> in 314,<br> you'll excuse me<br> if I go nuts.<br> Marion. Marion, oh,<br> I do hope it isn't you.<br> What did you say? I can't<br> hear with this water running.<br> I said come out<br> from under my shower!<br> No use. I can't understand<br> a word you're saying.<br> Stop it, Marion.<br> We're being watched.<br> I wish you'd fly out a window<br> and leave me alone.<br> Oh, Marion, confound it.<br> Use your common sense.<br> I've already used<br> my common sense.<br> I've ordered cocktails.<br> And you'd better jump in the<br> shower and get yourself pretty.<br> I wouldn't change my tie<br> with you in the room.<br> Oh, Toppy, don't worry about me.<br> Get into your dinner clothes.<br> You're not dressed, are<br> you? Yes, I am dressed.<br> Well, get so<br> that I can see you,<br> so that I can<br> keep track of you.<br> How's this?<br> You didn't have this on<br> under the shower, did you?<br> No. But I just decided to<br> be dressed, and here I am.<br> Now you get dressed,<br> and hurry up. All right.<br> You sit here<br> where I can see you.<br> And what am I supposed<br> to do, twile my thumbs?<br> Mr. Topper home? Mr.<br> Topper's not at home, sir.<br> Are you sure?<br> Am I sure?<br> Why, certainly, I'm sure, sir.<br> Why shouldn't I be sure?<br> I just wondered. You look to me like<br> the kind of fellow who might not be sure.<br> Mr. Topper is not at home,<br> sir. That's what I said.<br> Wilkins, what is the matter?<br> Oh.<br> Mrs. Topper?<br> Mrs. Topper, where's that<br> mouse of a husband of yours?<br> Mouse? Shall I eject this person, madam?<br> Yes.<br> Well, no.<br> Uh, listen, smiley,<br> you stay out of this.<br> Mrs. Topper, I'm looking for<br> that goofy husband of yours.<br> I beg your pardon, sir, but I must<br> ask you to be a little more careful...<br> with your language<br> in front of Mrs. Topper.<br> Otherwise, I shall<br> put the slug on you.<br> No, no. Don't be athletic.<br> Where's your husband?<br> Where's your husband,<br> Mrs. Topper?<br> I don't know.<br> Mr. Topper's gone away.<br> Yes, well, that's just what<br> I thought. What do you mean?<br> Mrs. Topper,<br> I'm looking for my wife,<br> and I've got a certain sneaking<br> suspicion that if I find Topper,<br> I'm gonna find her too! You<br> mean she might be with Cosmo?<br> Yes, well, it's just possible.<br> Listen, have you got a slug of scotch?<br> 'Cause I've got the jitters. I'm sorry, but<br> we've never had any stimulants in the house.<br> That's a fine thing. Why don't you have<br> a snort in the house for the poor man,<br> instead of lamb on Sunday, stew<br> on Monday, beef on Wednesday?<br> Why don't you go out dancing with him<br> occasionally? Then he wouldn't have left you.<br> I suppose you're right. Well,<br> it's too late now. Oh, dear.<br> Please go, sir. You're<br> breaking the madam's heart.<br> Yeah. Well, if I find<br> Topper, I'll break his neck.<br> And believe me, I'll find him! Oh!<br> He's very handsome, isn't he?<br> Mrs. Topper!<br> Get me an aspirin.<br> Why, of course.<br> Wilkins, I'm not supposed<br> to be the butler. You are.<br> So I am.<br> I'll get the aspirin myself.<br> Come in.<br> Marion, get out of here. Quick.<br> Someone's coming. That's right.<br> Come in.<br> What are you gaping at?<br> C- Can I hear you say<br> "Come in" again?<br> Don't be impertinent.<br> Put those things down there.<br> Well, hurry up. Hurry up. Oh, get out!<br> Can't you look where<br> I'm going? Yes, sir.<br> So what's eatin' you?<br> The next time I go to 314,<br> I'm not going.<br> Yeah, the guy's spooky.<br> I just brought him four cocktails.<br> Four cocktails at one time?<br> For one guy? Well,<br> one guy and two voices.<br> What do you mean, two voices? Well,<br> first he goes way down low like this.<br> Then he talks way up high<br> like a dame. Talks way up-<br> Talks way up high like a dame? Well,<br> get downstairs and get the manager.<br> Get him up here right away.<br> He don't need a manager.<br> He needs a straitjacket.<br> Hurry up.<br> Well?<br> Don't scare me like that.<br> You know I'm a bundle of<br> nerves when I'm on duty.<br> You sent for me, Casey. Yes, and<br> I'm glad you finally got here.<br> Why? What's wrong?<br> Hey, you see, the guy-<br> Quiet.<br> I'm in charge here.<br> Don't you understand?<br> He's got a woman in there,<br> and she's not registered.<br> I'll attend to this.<br> - Shh! Who is it? - I'm the hotel manager.<br> Please open this door at once.<br> Vanish.<br> Shh.<br> I'm sorry, sir,<br> but I shall have to ask you...<br> and, uh, the lady<br> to give up your room.<br> The lady?<br> What lady?<br> What lady? Perhaps you can<br> explain the red on this cigarette.<br> Yes. I cut my tongue<br> when I was shaving this morning.<br> Hmm. Cut your tongue?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Listen, don't try to kid us. There's<br> a woman in here. We heard her.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> She's gone.<br> Casey, you're a fool.<br> I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Topper, to<br> have caused you this embarrassment.<br> I- I hope you'll accept<br> my apology.<br> Oh, but think nothing of it. Promise<br> me you'll think nothing of it.<br> You have no idea how badly I should<br> feel if you didn't promise me...<br> you were going to think nothing<br> of it. Well, I am sorry. I-<br> I hope you'll accept<br> my humble apology.<br> Why, it's a deal.<br> I guess I'm sorry too.<br> Cuckoo!<br> Uh, m-me too. Get out<br> of here, you moron.<br> House detective, eh?<br> A fine hash<br> you've made of things.<br> Now don't tell me that<br> you hear two people laughing.<br> Another mistake like this<br> and you'll be fired.<br> Now, watch yourself.<br> Come on, Toppy.<br> I'm hungry.<br> Let's go down to dinner. On an empty<br> stomach? I want some more pink ladies.<br> I'll get you some more<br> pink ladies. Come on.<br> It's a good thing no one<br> saw us coming out of my room.<br> Why, Toppy,<br> I think we look lovely.<br> We're the best dressed<br> couple in this hallway.<br> Well, let's- let's pretend<br> we're not together.<br> Thank you, Toppy.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> You know, Marion,<br> you're positively beautiful.<br> Yes, I might almost say<br> you were gorgeous.<br> Mmm.<br> I will say it.<br> You are gorgeous.<br> I think you're<br> gorgeous too, darling.<br> Oh, captain, bring the wine<br> list. We don't want a wine list.<br> No? We want a flock more of pink ladies.<br> That's right.<br> Bring a lot of pink ladies.<br> And go on bringing them,<br> on and on. Yes, sir.<br> Yeah! Old Man Moon Wake up now<br> 'Cause I've fallen<br> in love<br> Yeah!<br> Go spread the news<br> To all the stars above<br> Shine for my baby<br> while we're dancin' tonight<br> I wanna dance.<br> I thought we wanted to drink. Mm-hmm.<br> I do. I wanna drink,<br> I wanna dance, I wanna sing.<br> I wanna-<br> I wanna have fun.<br> Whee! Whoo-hoo! Come on! Let's dance.<br> And if it's possible<br> Keep shinin' till noon<br> My sincerest thanks<br> to you, sir<br> Old Man Moon<br> My, this is fun. Well, I'm<br> glad one of us is enjoying it.<br> Oh, I say, huh? Oh, no. Don't<br> listen to me. I really like it a lot.<br> And I like you a lot. Toppy,<br> are you falling in love with me?<br> I tell you, I'm just<br> that way about you.<br> Just that way<br> about my wife, huh?<br> Listen, Marion, what did you mean<br> by that remark on the telephone?<br> "We're not married anymore. "<br> Come here. I want to talk to you.<br> Hey, listen, what are you<br> so burned up about?<br> What about you<br> up in Westchester?<br> Don't change the subject. What<br> did you mean by that remark?<br> You'll pardon us, but this is just<br> an old family after-dinner custom.<br> Now, listen, Marion - Oh, George, you're<br> ruining our good evening.<br> Here. Have a pink lady.<br> Oh, I've had a pink lady.<br> And to places with a good deed. I'd<br> rather have you. Of course, of course.<br> You stay out of this. Never mind,<br> Toppy. I'll meet you in the lobby.<br> What's wrong here? You are. Take a walk.<br> You can't talk that way to me. Shut up!<br> She's right.<br> That's enough out of you.<br> See here, young la-<br> Where did she go to?<br> Never mind.<br> You stay here like a good little<br> pelican, and I'll find her.<br> Hey, where are you?<br> Where'd you go to? Where<br> are ya, either one of ya?<br> Why don't you watch what you're<br> doing! I didn't do anything.<br> Well, then watch yourself. Well,<br> I've got enough to worry about.<br> What happened? I-<br> Stop pushing me! I'll not stop<br> pushing you because I didn't push you!<br> Ohh! Topper, you're going home<br> to your wife where you belong.<br> George, I won't be ordered<br> about. You're going home!<br> I am not.<br> Oh, yes, you are.<br> Oh, you naughty boy,<br> to tickle me like that.<br> What?<br> Well, my husband<br> will put a stop to this.<br> I wish he would, really.<br> Where are you going?<br> I quit.<br> That guy from 314<br> is too much for me.<br> Don't be silly. I'll have this rumpus<br> straightened out before I can bat an eye.<br> You just stand here<br> and bat your eyes.<br> I'm going out and get a nice<br> quiet job in a nut factory.<br> Sit down, Topper.<br> I wanna talk to you.<br> I won't sit down!<br> Oh, yes, you will.<br> No, I will not.<br> Something a little oabout<br> this hotel, don't you think?<br> I'm having a little chair trouble,<br> but you pay no attention to it.<br> I'm, uh- I'm reading.<br> Where's Casey? I don't know.<br> He wouldn't be any help anyway.<br> Well, you go call the police<br> before the whole hotel's wrecked.<br> George. George,<br> this can't go on.<br> It's gotta stop.<br> George.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Did you drop this?<br> Oh!<br> Why, you-<br> you witch, you!<br> Casey, get that wild man to my office<br> before we lose every guest in the house.<br> Right. I'll show him<br> who he thinks we are.<br> The manager wants to see you<br> instantaneously.<br> I don't wanna see him. Now, don't evade<br> the question. You're gonna see him anyhow.<br> George? George.<br> George!<br> Uh-huh.<br> I've been looking for you.<br> What do you say we make up? Okay, hon.<br> Hey, you know, this is<br> the best fight we ever had.<br> But look at poor Toppy. We've<br> gotta do something about him.<br> It's practically done.<br> Get his bag in the car.<br> All right, darling.<br> Oh!<br> What are you doing?<br> Stop it!<br> You're hurting Rollo!<br> Take this sack of bones<br> off of me!<br> Won't somebody help me, please? So you're<br> the guy that caused all this trouble, huh?<br> I'm the house detective.<br> I'm in charge here.<br> Come on. Get up.<br> Here, hold this while<br> I go for the cuffs.<br> Eh, what is this?<br> It's a dog.<br> Are you trying to make a<br> sap out of me? It's too late.<br> Who said that?<br> Did you say that?<br> Of course not.<br> That's what's wrong here.<br> There's a phantom something or<br> someone who's wrecking this hotel.<br> And I want him caught!<br> A phantom?<br> Who you trying to kid?<br> All right, men,<br> surround it!<br> Surround who?<br> Who's giving orders here?<br> You folks watch the door.<br> Come on, men. Follow me.<br> All right, men, line up.<br> We'll rake the room.<br> Quiet!<br> Ooh-ga-boo!<br> Steady, men.<br> We're closing in on him.<br> Bread and butter.<br> Ba-boom! Happy New Year!<br> There he is!<br> Ooh! Get off!<br> Up. Get up!<br> A fine bunch of cops<br> you are.<br> I had that guy right where he<br> wanted me, till you crossed him up.<br> He's gone!<br> He's gone!<br> Sergeant, he's gone. He got into<br> the automobile and drove away,<br> but nobody was driving it.<br> Oh, there must be an easier<br> way to make a livin' than this.<br> Stop squirming, Topper.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> I can't help it.<br> Look at that speedometer.<br> What are you two trying to do,<br> make me like you?<br> Can't help it, old boy.<br> I'm scared stiff!<br> Where are we going?<br> I'm sorry, Topper.<br> I don't know.<br> All I know is I've gotta<br> go there, fast! Slow down!<br> Please slow down!<br> I said you'd ruin me,<br> and you have.<br> Now you've done it.<br> George, Marion,<br> where are you? Oh.<br> A fine thing.<br> Here we are again.<br> Hmph. Once more around that<br> curve, I won't have a hat left.<br> Look at Topper.<br> Hmm?<br> Now look here, you two.<br> But look at me.<br> I'm just like you now.<br> Keep your garters on, Toppy.<br> You'll be all right. You're<br> just a little unconscious.<br> Ah, yeah. You're much<br> too solid, Topper.<br> I don't think you've become<br> a member of our club yet.<br> Well, I won't go back.<br> I won't do it. Why not?<br> You won't do what? I won't go<br> back to that silly old routine.<br> Up at 8:00, bed at 11:00.<br> Lamb on Sundays. I won't do it!<br> Oh, Topper, don't be foolish.<br> They won't make you do that again.<br> I'd rather stay here<br> with you and Marion,<br> even though it is like living<br> on the top of a volcano.<br> But, Topper, you've gotta go back. You<br> don't know how much it means to her.<br> No, I won't. Topper, you've<br> gotta go back! Don't you see-<br> George! Trumpets!<br> No, no, it isn't trumpets. It's<br> an ambulance! Get back, Topper!<br> No, I don't wanna go.<br> Well, if I've got to go,<br> I've got to go.<br> But I'll get up when I feel like it<br> in the morning and I'll have some fun.<br> Where were we?<br> You've had an accident, but you're safe<br> at home and you're going to be all right.<br> Where's-Where's Marion?<br> I'll call Mrs. Topper right<br> away. No, not Mrs. Topper.<br> Marion.<br> Who's Marion?<br> Oh. Mm-hmm.<br> She's probably someone I dreamed<br> about when I was in the ether.<br> But you didn't have any<br> ether. Oh, yes, I did.<br> You'd be surprised.<br> Your wife is very anxious to see<br> you.
