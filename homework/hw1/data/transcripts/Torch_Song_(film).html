                        Hold the record.<br> - Sorry, Miss Stewart.<br> - I'm sorry too.<br> Four times we've done this routine<br> and four times you've loused it up.<br> Gene, you're the dance director.<br> Would you tell Mr. Ellis this is a rehearsal,<br> not a dancing school?<br> - I'm sorry, Jenny...<br> - We've had the sorry bit. What do we do?<br> Well, darling, it's just that he feels...<br> ...that if you could get<br> your right leg in a bit, he...<br> And spoil that line?<br> Tell Mr. Ellis he's paid<br> to get around that leg.<br> And smile, or we get another boy.<br> - Joe.<br> - Yes, Jenny.<br> I'm going home.<br> Keep him here until he learns the routine.<br> If that ever happens, call me.<br> Practice makes perfect, Jenny.<br> For you, as well as for Ellis.<br> I don't recall that I was the one<br> who made the mistake.<br> - Charlie.<br> - Yeah?<br> Bring my new arrangement<br> to my dressing room.<br> All right, Jen, yeah.<br> Be right there, Jenny.<br> I'm coming.<br> - Got everything right here, dear, yeah.<br> Well, what about it?<br> Yeah, I'm working on it.<br> Did you fix the "Follow Me" number<br> the way I wanted it?<br> Uh...<br> - It just didn't work right, honey.<br> - What do you mean it didn't work?<br> Well, that is, at first it didn't.<br> - But I finally got it. Finally.<br> - How did it sound?<br> Sounded fine, of course. It sounded fine.<br> You see, Charlie, you're just<br> wasting your time fighting with me.<br> Charlie.<br> I was...<br> I was just trying to think of an answer.<br> That stuff will kill you someday.<br> Yeah, if I'm lucky.<br> - What?<br> - I said it's great. It's great, it just...<br> Make copies of the changes for me,<br> will you?<br> Well, I already have.<br> You know I'd do that, honey.<br> I'll leave it here on the couch.<br> I sure hope that you like it.<br> Well, if I don't,<br> you'll be the first to hear from me.<br> And stop worrying.<br> You've been doing my arrangements<br> long enough to know exactly what I want.<br> - Yeah, I sure have.<br> - What?<br> I said I sure have, yeah.<br> Oh, Charlie, before you go,<br> maybe I'll better look at those sheets.<br> You've been getting a little sloppy lately.<br> In fact, I'm thinking of replacing you<br> with a player piano.<br> One that doesn't smoke, drink,<br> mumble, or...<br> Leave me talking to myself.<br> - Jenny, I was just...<br> - Well.<br> You can always tell when<br> there's trouble in a show.<br> - It's the only time you see the producer.<br> - But Jenny...<br> oh, Phil, I know the line.<br> "Jenny, darling, we can iron this out. "<br> Give us a break, Jenny.<br> Give Ellis a break.<br> If you leave now,<br> there's no point in rehearsing at all.<br> If you'd hire competent people,<br> you wouldn't have grief.<br> But handing me more grief<br> isn't going to help any.<br> Oh, stop it. Phil, why aren't you here<br> when these problems come up?<br> If doctors performed operations<br> the way you produce shows...<br> ...everybody in the country<br> would be dead.<br> Here she comes.<br> Go on, beat it...<br> They shall not.<br> Wait for me in the car.<br> - Hi, Merle, how are you? Hi, Margie.<br> - Hi, Miss Stewart.<br> Hi, Elsie. I thought you'd forgotten me.<br> I haven't seen you for a week.<br> Oh, no. My mother was sick<br> and I had to take care of her.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> We should all take care of our mothers.<br> - Would you sign mine too?<br> - Sure. What's your name?<br> It's Cora.<br> You're gonna sign it personally?<br> Certainly. Ha-ha-ha.<br> "Cora, gratefully, Jenny Stewart. "<br> - Oh, thank you, Miss Stewart.<br> - You're welcome.<br> - Sure, I will. Sure, I will.<br> You can't leave, Miss Stewart.<br> I'll be back later, Miss Stewart.<br> Bye. Bye.<br> Now, let's get to that hoofer you hired<br> and the limping he calls dancing.<br> Darling, I pay Ellis a fantastic salary and<br> you wouldn't give him a minute's help.<br> Yet you'd spend an hour with those kids.<br> And what do they do?<br> - They're just the audience.<br> - They?<br> A hundred of those kids<br> couldn't scare up the price of one ticket.<br> Ten years from now,<br> they'll buy a thousand tickets.<br> None of us will be here<br> The theater will.<br> What? You make a religion out of a job.<br> A job.<br> Your idea of art's<br> the fruit in a slot machine.<br> - Oh... All right, go home...<br> - That's just what I'm going to do.<br> - Carl?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> I won't need you tonight.<br> - I'm not going back to rehearsals.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> What are you trying to do?<br> Put me in hospital?<br> I'm going to save you a lot of money<br> by not going back.<br> Unless somebody shocks that company,<br> this show will never open.<br> Six weeks in a rehearsal<br> that should've taken two.<br> The script needs jokes,<br> the music needs cutting.<br> And the staging... Ahh!<br> It stinks.<br> You don't think we've got a flop?<br> No show Jenny Stewart's in<br> is going to be a flop.<br> If I have to pull every trick in the book<br> to make it hang together.<br> Attababy.<br> Carl, after you drop me,<br> will you take Mr. Norton home?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> What's your address, Mr. Norton?<br> Any dark bar.<br> - Rehearsal broke early, huh?<br> - For me.<br> - I've got all your fan mail caught up.<br> - Good.<br> - You need some pictures signed.<br> - Right.<br> Answer this and tell them<br> I'm sorry I can't be there.<br> All right.<br> - Mr. Cliff Willard called.<br> - To say what?<br> He's dining at El Morocco.<br> He thought you might like to join him.<br> And pick up the check.<br> - Who else called?<br> - Your mother.<br> Oh. Gee, I must call her.<br> Also, your sister.<br> Also, your mother again.<br> - How much this time?<br> - Two hundred dollars.<br> - Better make out the check.<br> - I already have.<br> I'm not going back to rehearsals tonight.<br> Trouble, huh?<br> Hmm.<br> How would you like<br> some lamb chops for dinner?<br> That will be fine, Anne.<br> - Feel better now?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Scene starts at the bottom of the page.<br> - Who am I?<br> - George.<br> George.<br> - "Knock, knock, knock. "<br> - I'll get it.<br> Oh, George, you're late.<br> You know the Camdens, don't you?<br> - And this is...<br> - oh, yes...<br> That's a broken speech.<br> You'll have to come in quick.<br> - And this is...<br> - oh, yes, we've met.<br> How are you?<br> May I speak to you in the library, Chris?<br> Crosses to library.<br> Ooh.<br> That's a long one.<br> Better make a note.<br> I need a line to cover that cross.<br> In, closes door...<br> ...leans against it.<br> Darling Chris, is there anything I can do?<br> Anything you need?<br> I don't need anything or anybody.<br> If you're worried about me, don't be.<br> I'm not afraid of being alone.<br> I'll never be lonely.<br> I'll... oh.<br> Oh, it's that long speech.<br> I never can remember it.<br> Anne, I'm sorry, it has to have more work.<br> I can't do any more tonight.<br> Okay. I'll type up the changes<br> and have it ready in the morning.<br> - It's a nice scene.<br> - Mm-hm. It will be when I learn it.<br> - Good night.<br> - Night.<br> Hmm.<br> What would I be thinking<br> on that long cross?<br> Hm.<br> George, you're late.<br> Library.<br> I know what you're gonna say.<br> Henry and I, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<br> And George says,<br> "Do you need anything?"<br> No, I don't need anything or anybody.<br> And George says, "But I'm worried. "<br> And I say,<br> if you're worried about me, don't be.<br> I'm not afraid of being alone.<br> I'll never be lonely.<br> I'm tough, George.<br> That's why I'll never be lonely.<br> Look who's talking.<br> I'll never...<br> Be lone...<br> Okay, kids, come on,<br> take your places, will you?<br> Now, you two girls go to the inside<br> and boys go to the outside during this step.<br> One, two. Ready, and:<br> One, two. That's it.<br> Okay, the same thing on this side.<br> Ready and: One, two. That's it.<br> Okay, can you keep your places, please?<br> Now, you two girls with Fallon<br> at the front doing this:<br> Ready, and:<br> Again, and:<br> Right.<br> Okay, you can go sit up front.<br> Hold down the talking.<br> Remember, no smoking.<br> - Any word yet?<br> - No.<br> Miss Stewart's residence.<br> No, I'm sorry, she isn't.<br> - She left here about an hour ago.<br> Morning, darling.<br> I have no idea where. You're welcome.<br> - The theater again.<br> - Oh.<br> - You took long enough.<br> - I didn't even stop for breakfast.<br> So you know where the gin is.<br> Look at this. All hips.<br> And this.<br> Who could move in it? This is okay.<br> Where'd you go last night?<br> Well, since you wouldn't go out with me,<br> I went to bed early.<br> That isn't the way I heard it.<br> Some belle from White Plains, wasn't it?<br> Oh, yes. I did go out for a few minutes.<br> I know.<br> To mail a letter at El Morocco.<br> She's just a child.<br> I did it as a favor.<br> To get her name in print so she could dazzle<br> the boys in White Plains.<br> Ha!<br> If they printed what really happened,<br> she'd be run out of White Plains by noon.<br> Jenny, do you think I like going to<br> the same musical for the 25th time?<br> Making the rounds of the same nightclubs,<br> drinking the same old rotgut...<br> - Yes.<br> - You're right, I do.<br> - But only with Jenny Stewart.<br> - Hmm. Now we get to the point.<br> Next time you go out without Jenny,<br> don't sign her name to the checks.<br> Ohh.<br> Yeah, I did run short.<br> But don't worry, I'll make it up to you.<br> - What do you think of my costumes?<br> - Sensational.<br> - You haven't even looked.<br> - I don't have to.<br> Alexandria designed them,<br> they can only be great.<br> They stink.<br> - Jenny...<br> - But I'll make them better.<br> When are you gonna stop<br> trying to remake everything...<br> ...to look like, act like and talk like you?<br> When I get everything the way I want it.<br> Yeah, but you work at it 24 hours a day.<br> - You don't go out, you don't have...<br> - Look, get this through your head.<br> The first time I ever sang,<br> I fell in love with the audience.<br> I've been in love with the audience<br> ever since.<br> I'm going to give them the best<br> that's in me.<br> No matter who, what,<br> or when tries to stop me.<br> Including you.<br> Now get your pad and pencil.<br> We'll make some notes on the sketches.<br> You're completely useless.<br> But beautiful.<br> Just the way<br> I want these sketches to be.<br> You seen her?<br> You know anybody's seen her?<br> Thanks. You're a great help.<br> Willie don't know either.<br> All he says is,<br> "Why don't you ask Monty Rolfe?"<br> That's a good idea. Let's ask Monty.<br> He's supposed to be her agent.<br> - Isn't he, Monty?<br> - Take it easy, Joe.<br> Sure, what's it to me? Take it easy.<br> I've only got two dozen people sitting<br> for hours all on salary, waiting for her.<br> Hey, Joe, she's here.<br> Well, what's she waiting for?<br> Tell her the red carpet's at the cleaners.<br> - You want Carl to drop you anywhere?<br> - No, I'm just going around the corner.<br> Usual time, Carl.<br> Hey, that's pretty.<br> - Well?<br> - Well what?<br> Well, how do they compare?<br> Oh.<br> Jenny, you have no competition.<br> They're living examples<br> of perfect bilateral symmetry.<br> - I mean, the poster.<br> - Oh, that's good too.<br> - When will I see you, Jenny?<br> - You'll get a call when I need you.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Good morning, Miss Stewart.<br> - Good morning.<br> - We were getting a little worried.<br> - Why?<br> Here, put these on the piano.<br> Okay, boy, you got the ball now.<br> I'm going back to the office.<br> Joe.<br> Yes, Jenny?<br> Good morning, Jenny.<br> Oh.<br> I've made a few changes.<br> You have? What are they?<br> Well, in "Follow Me"...<br> ...I wanna finish the first chorus ad lib<br> with a retard in the last two bars.<br> In the second chorus, last four bars soft<br> and then up for a sock finish.<br> You'll probably hate it.<br> Why, Jen? I have a hunch I'll love it.<br> Would you mind if I loved it, Jen?<br> Not at all.<br> Let's listen and see how it sounds.<br> Morning, Charlie.<br> Let's take it right here, full intro...<br> Who is this character?<br> My name is Tye Graham.<br> - Where's Charlie?<br> - He quit.<br> So he has a hangover.<br> When's he coming in?<br> He quit.<br> What do you mean? We have a contract.<br> Oh, you still have it. It's in your<br> dressing room, on the floor, in pieces.<br> What does this guy want?<br> He gets 500 bucks a week<br> for working four hours a day.<br> Well, deducting taxes, ulcer treatments<br> and psychiatric sessions...<br> ...his take-home pay<br> was slightly under $ 10.<br> Get him back.<br> Let's see what happens.<br> I've marked all the changes.<br> You start here...<br> Yes, Miss Stewart, I'm blind.<br> I apologize for Mr. Denner,<br> he should've told you.<br> Oh, please don't let my blindness<br> bother you.<br> I'm familiar with your style,<br> I know all your keys.<br> I went over your arrangements<br> with Charlie.<br> Would you like to start now?<br> Yes, sure.<br> You see, right here... I mean...<br> You mean you wanna finish<br> the first chorus ad lib...<br> ...the retard in the last two bars.<br> The second chorus, the last four bars soft<br> and up for a sock finish.<br> Is that the way you want it?<br> Yes.<br> That's the way I want it.<br> We shouldn't have any trouble.<br> Mm-hm. Feels good.<br> Joe, I think that's about all it needed,<br> don't you?<br> You're the singer, Jenny.<br> If that's the way you wanna do it.<br> Sounds fine.<br> Thanks.<br> Thanks for nothing.<br> What did you think?<br> - What's your name?<br> - Graham.<br> - Tye Graham.<br> - Well?<br> Well, I found it a little...<br> Unorthodox.<br> Meaning what? It stinks?<br> Oh, no, I'd never say that.<br> I'm sure you wouldn't.<br> However, the modulation seemed<br> a little abrupt.<br> But we could easily correct that.<br> Make it a little less arbitrary.<br> Oh. We could.<br> Well, I happen to like it unorthodox,<br> arbitrary and abrupt.<br> What I'm most interested in is,<br> will it sell?<br> Well, I'm sure that if anybody could sell it,<br> that body is probably you.<br> - I'll take that as a compliment, I think.<br> Jenny.<br> Let's run through that dance routine now.<br> Gene tells me Ellis is ready.<br> Okay, where is he?<br> - He's just changing. He'll be right out.<br> - Does he know it?<br> I'd stake my life on it, Jenny.<br> I'll put the record on.<br> Start it at the four-four.<br> I'll find out if he knows it.<br> - Good morning, Miss Stewart.<br> - Good luck.<br> That's nice, Ellis.<br> I guarantee you we'll be good<br> for two bows opening night.<br> Well, thank you, Miss Stewart.<br> Got a cigarette?<br> I'm sorry, I only smoke a pipe.<br> - You a friend of Charlie Maylor's?<br> - I know him, yes.<br> Why doesn't he wanna work<br> with me anymore?<br> Go ahead.<br> Well, all right.<br> To put it in a nutshell...<br> ...he says you're a pretty rugged<br> sort of a dame to work with.<br> Why did you take over?<br> Curiosity.<br> About what?<br> Well, let's say I wanted to meet you...<br> ...to get to know more about you.<br> Why?<br> Do any of us really know<br> why we do what we do?<br> I think we do, Mr. Graham.<br> - Give me a cigarette.<br> - Maybe we ought to run though that...<br> You should've asked me<br> before you took on a new man.<br> If you came and found no one...<br> ...you'd scream your head off at me<br> for not getting somebody.<br> Well...<br> This isn't going to work.<br> There's no reason why it shouldn't, Jenny,<br> if you'll just let it.<br> Don't you think you better run<br> the whole number?<br> No. No more dancing before lunch.<br> Well, we've still got half an hour.<br> How about "Two-Faced Woman"?<br> Okay.<br> You think you know "Two-Faced Woman"<br> well enough to run through it?<br> I know every note.<br> Wait a minute. I thought you said you<br> went over these arrangements with Charlie.<br> - I did.<br> - Then what happened to the tempo?<br> I made a slight retard.<br> - You were singing beautifully, but I...<br> - Look, Mr. Graham.<br> You've been hired<br> to help me rehearse only.<br> The arrangements have been set.<br> When this show opens, there will be<br> So stop auditioning on my time.<br> It seemed a bit fast to me<br> so my right hand slowed down.<br> - It has a mind of its own.<br> - Then sit on it.<br> Shall we try it again? The right way?<br> I was trying to,<br> but I can do it your way...<br> Just a minute!<br> - Now I have to argue with a dog.<br> - Easy, Duchess.<br> She's not used to loud voices.<br> If she expects to stay around here,<br> she'd better get used to them.<br> Jenny.<br> Come here a minute.<br> Jenny, I've never lied to you<br> and I won't now.<br> Honey, you're making a mistake.<br> You don't expect me<br> to take any more of this.<br> Why don't you listen to him?<br> His idea of that song was better than yours.<br> Well, I don't happen to like it.<br> I don't like it a bit.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I don't happen to like him.<br> He's showing off and I hate show-offs.<br> Time to get his own spotlight.<br> He's not gonna have mine.<br> I can't work with him, Joe.<br> Get it over with.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, I'll fire him.<br> All right, everybody, lunch.<br> Hurry it up.<br> And don't be too late coming back.<br> Porterhouse okay?<br> Yeah.<br> We could use that energy<br> when you're working.<br> - Bye.<br> - I'll see you at lunchtime.<br> Okay, say it.<br> Say it was a lousy thing to do.<br> I don't care.<br> You ought to get over that habit<br> of throwing things.<br> - Someday you'll throw a boomerang.<br> - Well, how can you work with a man of...?<br> Who can't even see what you're doing?<br> He doesn't even know what I look like.<br> He has no business in this business.<br> Maybe he had no business<br> being in the war.<br> Joe, I have very broad shoulders.<br> But not broad enough<br> for the whole world to cry on.<br> All right, Jenny.<br> Someday you may need a shoulder<br> to cry on yourself.<br> Only it won't be there.<br> - What will it take to get Charlie back?<br> - I can't get him back.<br> Give him whatever he wants.<br> I can't. He wants something<br> I don't have the power to offer him.<br> - What's that?<br> - A new leading lady.<br> Then let him starve.<br> Hi, Jenny.<br> - So long, Tye. Let me hear from you.<br> - Yes, I will.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Well, I did it. I didn't like it, but I did it.<br> I'll call Charlie and ask him to come back<br> for the good old "good of the show. "<br> He's sentimental. Maybe it'll work.<br> Offer him 600 and free treatments<br> with his psychiatrist.<br> Miss Stewart.<br> - Yes?<br> Won't you sit down?<br> I get you fired and you invite me<br> to sit down with you?<br> Don't worry, I won't have to sell pencils.<br> Sit down, please, won't you?<br> All right, I will.<br> Now what?<br> - Ahem. I'm a little puzzled by you.<br> - There's no mystery about me.<br> It's been rumored<br> that I'm rather brutally frank.<br> It's also been rumored<br> that you're pretty and talented.<br> You can get people to do what you want<br> without hitting first and asking afterwards.<br> This business has its own rules.<br> You either hit first or get hit.<br> If anybody's to be kicked,<br> it's not going to be you, is that it?<br> That's the world's oldest<br> and smartest philosophy.<br> And the reason we had to make laws<br> and establish religions.<br> The subject's too serious for me<br> to take on an empty stomach.<br> - Wai...<br> - Waiter. Menu, please.<br> Did, uh? Ahem.<br> Did you ever hear of defense mechanism?<br> You mean like a girdle?<br> All right, we'll drop the serious talk.<br> No, when the talk's about me<br> I'll buy a ticket.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> - Lobster Newberg and coffee.<br> - On my check, please.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Go on.<br> Well, ahem...<br> ...you're scared.<br> Me?<br> - Of what?<br> - Well, it's...<br> ...of being weak and vulnerable<br> to criticism. Like anybody else.<br> You're like the kid who went fishing<br> for perch and caught a whale.<br> He knew if he hung on to the rod,<br> he'd drown.<br> But if he let go, all the other kids<br> would say that he was yellow.<br> So there he was with a whale<br> on the end of his line.<br> Big second-act curtain.<br> What did he do for the third act?<br> Well, someone with common sense...<br> ...and compassion for human weakness<br> came along and cut the line for him.<br> You're not scared of anything, huh?<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> I don't conform to pattern.<br> I live in an ivory tower.<br> - Ivory towers can be lonely.<br> - Oh, I'm not alone.<br> No, but you will be<br> if you keep that dog around.<br> Look at her. She's still itching<br> to take a bite out of me.<br> Why don't you get yourself<br> a nice seeing-eye girl?<br> Sorry.<br> I warned you I hit first,<br> but not usually quite that low.<br> - It's all right, forget it.<br> Pardon me.<br> - Ahem. May I have my check, please?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I don't think that seeing-eye girl idea<br> would quite work out.<br> No? Why not?<br> Well, women have to be told<br> how much you love the color of their hair...<br> ...and how much you love<br> the color of their eyes.<br> Women need admiration.<br> More than food and drink,<br> women need admiration.<br> With you,<br> I bet they'd sure have to sweat for it.<br> No.<br> But admiration given away free<br> is valueless.<br> But admiration earned<br> has a lasting quality about it.<br> - Your check, sir.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Goodbye, Miss Stewart.<br> - What else did Charlie tell you about me?<br> Well...<br> ...he said that you had<br> a sensational figure...<br> ...but that you throw it about<br> like a burlesque queen.<br> He said you had beautiful legs...<br> ...but they always walked<br> in the wrong direction.<br> And?<br> He said that your mouth belonged<br> to an angel...<br> ...but the words that came out of it<br> were pure tramp.<br> The next time you see Charlie Maylor...<br> ...tell him to take those 88 keys,<br> black and white, one by one...<br> Stop it, Jenny.<br> Do you think if I believed one word<br> that he said...<br> ...I'd have told you?<br> I'll be seeing you.<br> Sorry, Mr. Graham.<br> I didn't expect you home.<br> And you caught me sleeping.<br> Next time,<br> I'll try not to let you catch me. Sorry.<br> Didn't I tell you never to say sorry?<br> Yes, Mr. Graham, I'm so...<br> I almost said sorry. How about a drink?<br> Yes, make it a double, please.<br> - You had a short rehearsal.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - I got fired.<br> - Fired?<br> Yes, I'm afraid I made a bad investment.<br> Two weeks salary, a thousand dollars.<br> Roundtrip ticket to Cuba, $200.<br> Well, someone will have a good time<br> on the money at least.<br> Yes, Charlie Maylor.<br> May I be so bold as to ask,<br> was it worth it?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Too bad.<br> There are no wise and comforting words<br> of Confucius to cover this situation.<br> - Aren't there other Chinese philosophers?<br> - Only my grandfather.<br> He always say,<br> "The easy ones are no fun. "<br> - Angry?<br> - No.<br> I was rude, wasn't I?<br> A little.<br> It was a dull party.<br> People like that can waste your life away.<br> Why be bored?<br> You're right, it was dull.<br> But it was the only party in town tonight.<br> All right, we'll do what you want.<br> You go on home, drop me off at my place.<br> I'll curl up in front of the fire<br> with a good book...<br> ...or a bad girl.<br> Yes, madam?<br> Sorry, I was looking<br> for Mr. Graham's apartment.<br> Yes, ma'am. Come in, please.<br> - He lives here?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Mr. Graham expecting you, ma'am?<br> No, but he'll see me.<br> Please sit down, ma'am.<br> Mr. Graham not wish interruptions.<br> You wait, please, ma'am.<br> - Tell him I wanna see him. Jenny Stewart.<br> - You take a seat, please, ma'am.<br> Duchess, you came in<br> in the wrong number.<br> The next one is<br> "Quintet for Concerto and Growl. "<br> - You have a visitor, Tye.<br> - Oh.<br> I think it's Jenny Stewart.<br> Quiet, Duchess.<br> Why don't you freshen<br> your drinks, boys?<br> I'd enjoy a touch. How about you, Jean?<br> Mr. Graham.<br> - What a pleasant surprise.<br> - Won't you come in?<br> - No, thanks.<br> I certainly didn't expect<br> your ivory tower to be jumping.<br> We were trying to find something new<br> in "Blue Moon. " Come and listen.<br> I'm on my way to a party and I'm late.<br> I wouldn't have come by at all if Joe hadn't<br> said you wouldn't come back to work.<br> Even if I asked you personally.<br> You never turn down a challenge,<br> do you?<br> We called it a bet.<br> Well, how big a bet?<br> Joe's a friend of mine...<br> Don't worry, it won't break him.<br> We start rehearsals<br> tomorrow morning at 9.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, Jenny.<br> - I know you weren't eavesdropping, Martha.<br> - Yes, I was.<br> They you know I've become a controversy<br> in the life of Jenny Stewart.<br> Even if it's only<br> a commercial controversy, a bet.<br> Tye, I don't get it.<br> You tell me you want her,<br> but you don't tell me why.<br> Is it because she's impossible to have?<br> That you wanna beat her down<br> and feel like a conqueror?<br> - No, it's nothing like that.<br> - Well, then what? There's no love in her.<br> Who knows?<br> If I thought it would do any good,<br> I'd fight you too.<br> Insult you, degrade you.<br> You don't have to do<br> anything like that, Martha.<br> I like you as you are.<br> But not enough.<br> What's the matter with me?<br> L...<br> I guess you're everything<br> that any sensible man would ever want.<br> You're intelligent, sensitive and faithful.<br> But I can't see you.<br> I don't know what you look like.<br> - But you can see Jenny Stewart.<br> - Yes, I know what she looks like.<br> I'm sure you're lovely, but...<br> But it would be like putting my arms<br> around a shadow.<br> Well, I told you what I look like.<br> The boys have described me<br> down to the smallest detail.<br> And every detail sounds beautiful.<br> But it still isn't good enough.<br> I could never really see you.<br> Oh, Tye.<br> Tye, why didn't I know you before?<br> Why?<br> Why are you playing that?<br> I didn't know you'd come in yet,<br> Miss Stewart.<br> Play it again.<br> "Tenderly. "<br> I sang that in my first show.<br> - Did you know that?<br> - Vaguely.<br> I thought everybody had forgotten it.<br> Not everybody.<br> Miss Stewart, may I ask you a question?<br> Sure.<br> Did Joe pay off?<br> I always collect.<br> Let's cut the music.<br> - Get to the rehearsal.<br> - Are you sure there really was a bet?<br> That was fine, boys. Whoops.<br> Have to break for dinner.<br> Be back at 7:15 ready to play.<br> Seven-fifteen, sharp.<br> Tye, I think she's doing a beautiful job.<br> How was that?<br> The consensus of opinion<br> is you're doing fine.<br> Consensus of opinion?<br> Would that include you?<br> By definition.<br> Why, yes, of course.<br> By definition.<br> How stupid of me to ask.<br> I liked it.<br> See you later.<br> Martha.<br> Joe.<br> Yeah?<br> Let's keep the visitors out<br> during rehearsals, huh?<br> - Miss Stewart?<br> - Yes?<br> I'm leaving now.<br> Your dinner's in the icebox.<br> All you have to do is heat it.<br> Thanks, Anne.<br> It's a beautiful day.<br> No Sunday's beautiful.<br> Have a good time.<br> Right. Bye.<br> Anne?<br> When you hear the tone...<br> ...the time will be<br> exactly 11:28 and three-quarters.<br> Stay tuned for your 11:30 edition<br> of the news broadcast which follows in six...<br> Nine-fifteen.<br> A- B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-o-P.<br> The number you have dialed is incorrect.<br> Please be sure you know the right number<br> and have dialed it correctly.<br> This is a recording.<br> The number you have dialed is incorrect.<br> Hello, Mom?<br> Heh. So I says, "Well, that's all<br> very flattering, Professor Pirkheimer...<br> ...but really, $ 10 a lesson, twice a week.<br> Huh.<br> We ain't got that much money.<br> We're poor people. "<br> So he says,<br> "Well, what about Miss Stewart?<br> Wouldn't she help?"<br> And I says, "I wouldn't hear of it.<br> I wouldn't allow it.<br> All right, I know what you're thinking.<br> My daughter, Jenny,<br> she's a very successful girl.<br> A wealthy woman, if you like. "<br> New necklace, dear?<br> "That's no reason why she should pay<br> for her sister's education...<br> ...and buy her brother Marty a new car.<br> Just because a new car would give him a<br> better territory for his salesmanship career...<br> ...is no reason she should shell out<br> her poor hard-earned money. "<br> We're not talking about Marty's car.<br> We're talking about my piano lessons.<br> The professor says that Celia<br> will play Carnegie Hall yet.<br> - That with a talent like...<br> - All right, you sold me.<br> I'll pay for her lessons.<br> Send me the bills, I'll take care of them.<br> Celia, play something soothing.<br> Excuse me,<br> I have to make a telephone call.<br> Stop it. I hate that piece.<br> Monty? Jenny.<br> Listen, I've decided<br> to throw a party tonight.<br> Get some of the gang together, will you?<br> Oh, Cliff Willard, Ted, Jerry maybe.<br> You know who I like.<br> What do you mean, short notice?<br> Well, don't tell me<br> everybody's busy on Sunday night.<br> I know.<br> I have a family too.<br> And listen.<br> I think it'd be nice<br> if we had some music, don't you?<br> Some of the boys from the band.<br> And why don't you call that new man?<br> Tye...<br> What's his name, Tye Graham?<br> Yeah.<br> Okay. See you around 6.<br> Chuck.<br> Thank you.<br> Good voice, huh?<br> In fact, a little too good<br> ever to be invited here again.<br> As long as they like him,<br> why should I care?<br> You're pure storybook.<br> You're a handmaid child of destiny.<br> You take a swatch of life,<br> twist it into the shape you want...<br> ...and then shove it down<br> to the throats of the weaklings.<br> What's more,<br> they buy tickets to watch you.<br> You drink too much.<br> Hmm. This is my lens.<br> Strangely enough,<br> it brings everything into focus.<br> You know what I see?<br> The future: You without me.<br> - Did I ever tell you otherwise?<br> - No, no, you never did.<br> I never stood a chance with you, did I?<br> Jenny, there's no one like you on Earth.<br> You're the distilled<br> essence of effectiveness.<br> Your leg moves<br> and a million faces look up.<br> You throat utters a word<br> and even a blind man can see you.<br> Why don't you switch to water?<br> Monty. Excuse me.<br> I told you to get Tye Graham.<br> Why isn't he here?<br> He couldn't make it.<br> Like they say, if you want anything done,<br> do it yourself.<br> - It's no use, Jen. He isn't home.<br> - Where is he?<br> He was going to dinner with Joe.<br> Why isn't Joe here?<br> He's entertaining Tye Graham.<br> Very funny.<br> You're a laugh a minute.<br> Give me a cigarette between jokes.<br> Light?<br> What's the matter, Jen?<br> You asked for this party.<br> You know, I've been watching you.<br> I can hear that volcano rumbling.<br> What's with you and this Tye Graham?<br> Look, Monty.<br> You get 10 percent of my earnings,<br> but my problems belong to me 100 percent.<br> Now get back in there and tell them<br> to get out. All of them, and fast.<br> All right, everybody,<br> on stage for the finale.<br> Okay, come on.<br> On stage for the finale, Miss Stewart.<br> All right, all right. I'll be there.<br> Splendid.<br> WoMAN:<br> I've been waiting for this for a long time.<br> - I don't think we'll have any trouble at all.<br> WoMAN: Just great.<br> Come on, everybody,<br> I'll buy you all a drink.<br> Oh, let's go.<br> Quiet while I give your instructions.<br> Remember, tomorrow morning,<br> - Good night. It was a wonderful show.<br> Thank you.<br> WoMAN: Good night.<br> Bye.<br> - Did you get my compartment?<br> - Better. Got a drawing room.<br> Good. What space did you get for Tye?<br> He isn't going to Philadelphia.<br> - Chuck?<br> - Yes.<br> Put this in my dressing room.<br> Right.<br> So I says to her, I says,<br> "Well, that's all very well, Mrs. Kurtz.<br> I love the apartment.<br> I know it's a bargain.<br> Only $30 more than we're paying now.<br> But who are we to live in the East 50s?<br> Why, we're poor people.<br> The old apartment's good enough for us. "<br> She said, "After all,<br> you're Jenny Stewart's mother. "<br> - Take that coat off now!<br> - Oh, Jenny, it's such a beautiful coat.<br> You hardly ever wear it.<br> - Mother, will you get her...?<br> - All right, we won't get in your way.<br> Take off that coat, Celia.<br> Call us and let us know<br> how everything goes.<br> - I will, Mom. And don't worry.<br> - All right, good luck.<br> Thank you.<br> Celia?<br> - I like the way it looks on you.<br> - Oh, Jenny, I'll even wear it to bed.<br> Bye.<br> Oh, Anne?<br> Put these in the trunk. No.<br> You better get the shoes in that.<br> Never mind.<br> Get Tye Graham on the telephone.<br> Tell him I'll... Never mind, I'll talk to him.<br> Just get him on the phone.<br> Mr. Graham for Miss Stewart, please.<br> Oh, I see.<br> She said she doesn't know<br> if he can talk now.<br> Can you call him later?<br> What do you mean "she"?<br> This is Jenny Stewart<br> and I wanna talk to him now.<br> You sure took your time getting here.<br> Couch is straight ahead of you<br> to your left.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I'm surprised to see your dog with you.<br> I thought you'd taken my advice<br> about a seeing-eye girl.<br> What ever gave you that idea?<br> It certainly wasn't Duchess<br> who answered the telephone.<br> Wasn't it?<br> You know, you have the most revolting way<br> of answering a question with a question.<br> I do?<br> Was that the girl<br> who picked you up at the theater?<br> She's a member of our quintet.<br> Not too talented to be troublesome.<br> She's pretty.<br> So they tell me.<br> I met her through my editor.<br> What quintet and what editor?<br> I used to write drama<br> and music reviews before the war.<br> The quintet is a group of my friends.<br> We play together<br> because we like to be together.<br> Where did you find them?<br> Why?<br> Why do you want to know?<br> Curiosity.<br> Like you once said about me,<br> I wanna know more about you.<br> Well, that's fair enough.<br> I knew most of them many years ago<br> before the war when I could see them.<br> I know their moods, I know their faces.<br> I know how they look when they frown<br> or when they smile.<br> With these people, I feel at ease.<br> I can see them.<br> I'm happy to be with them<br> because I can see them.<br> I understand.<br> Is that all you wanted to see me about?<br> No.<br> Why aren't you going<br> into Philadelphia with us?<br> My work is finished.<br> I...<br> I wish I could say that I've enjoyed<br> every minute of it, but I can't.<br> You are almost impossible to work with,<br> but I think I understand why.<br> Your first loyalty isn't to money, or having<br> your name up in lights, or even to yourself.<br> It's your audience, isn't it?<br> You sound as if<br> you're feeling sorry for me.<br> I am.<br> Why are you always needling?<br> Digging, ripping people apart.<br> What is it with you?<br> Is that how you get your kicks<br> or something?<br> I'll tell you why you should go<br> to Philadelphia.<br> We might have to change<br> a few routines during the tryout.<br> It's happened before.<br> Might have to do a lot of rearranging.<br> I might need your opinion.<br> Does my opinion have<br> any real importance to you, Jenny?<br> Of course.<br> You know your job, you're honest.<br> You hate me, but you're honest.<br> I'm sorry, I can't go with the company.<br> I've made other plans.<br> And I don't hate you, Jenny.<br> You sure give a good imitation of it.<br> All during rehearsals.<br> You made me feel<br> as if you were up there on that stage...<br> ...and I was down in the pit<br> looking up at you.<br> I don't know how you did it,<br> but you made me feel about that big.<br> All right, Jenny.<br> You're wonderful.<br> You're marvelous.<br> You're the be all and end all.<br> The "times" in Times Square<br> and the "broad" in Broadway.<br> - Will that do?<br> - No, it won't.<br> And another thing.<br> Tonight after dress rehearsal...<br> ...you walked out without a goodbye,<br> good luck, nothing.<br> What do you expect me to say?<br> That I like you?<br> I don't.<br> That I'll miss you? I won't.<br> That I can't live without you? I can.<br> - Don't you shout at me.<br> - Why not?<br> You made a career of shouting at people.<br> - It's time you heard some of the echoes.<br> - Ah!<br> That's a wilted summer stock line<br> if ever I heard one.<br> And that's part of your act too.<br> Everything you don't say is corny.<br> But every time you open your mouth, you<br> expect to rock the world back on its heels.<br> I've rocked it a few times, buster.<br> Then why not give it a rest?<br> Why not relax?<br> Stop trying to make the world shout<br> "Hurrah for Jenny" every hour on the hour.<br> Do you know where this<br> is gonna take you?<br> Where, professor?<br> To a day when no producer's gonna use you<br> because you aren't worth all the trouble.<br> To a day when you're aren't the great Jenny<br> Stewart, but a cheap and vulgar has-been.<br> And then there'll be the bottle.<br> But even liquor won't lie to you.<br> I hit the bottom pretty fast, didn't I?<br> And even on the way down,<br> you won't be original.<br> You'll dye that lovely,<br> dark red mane of yours, that...<br> That Gypsy Madonna hair,<br> all colors of the rainbow.<br> Anything to hide<br> your real self from yourself.<br> "Gypsy Madonna"?<br> Gypsy Madonna was a painting by Titian,<br> an Italian artist.<br> I know all about him,<br> you don't have to tell me.<br> He lived in venice<br> and died of the plague.<br> Now get out of here<br> before you give it to me.<br> I didn't know you was coming<br> or I'd have gotten some high-class beer.<br> - Beer is beer.<br> - Not anymore.<br> They don't make it like they did<br> when your father was drinking.<br> You could taste the hop.<br> And the malt used to hit you in back<br> of the head like a ton of brick.<br> - Nowadays, it all taste mild.<br> - It's okay.<br> And them pretzels,<br> they ain't no bargain neither.<br> Look at the thin, scrawny things. Hah.<br> Ain't got enough salt on them<br> to make a cat thirsty.<br> I'm not hungry anyway. Thanks.<br> - Something wrong?<br> - No, it tastes fine.<br> Well, it ain't the beer I'm talking about.<br> Here it is midnight. And you're here and<br> you've got an early train in the morning.<br> It is late.<br> I'd better be going. You must be tired.<br> Well, don't go on my account, Jen.<br> You know, I always stay up late.<br> I like to hear that<br> Mr. Nightclub's Platter Party.<br> The records he plays are square,<br> but, oh, he talks an awful hip commercial.<br> - I know.<br> - You listen to him to, huh?<br> He's company.<br> Trouble with the show?<br> No.<br> Your health?<br> You know, doctor-type health?<br> No.<br> Need money?<br> No, Mom.<br> That I got.<br> - Man trouble.<br> - No.<br> Yes.<br> I'm gonna break out that bottle of<br> champagne I've been keeping for my wake.<br> Come on, take off the shoes<br> and tell me all about it.<br> - Nothing much to say.<br> - Well, say it.<br> - Well, he's a man that...<br> - Well, that's a profit anyway.<br> At least he ain't no hothouse clotheshorse<br> like you always get in the papers with.<br> He's blind.<br> Well...<br> Your father was somewhat bald,<br> you know, when I married him.<br> I guess we all carry<br> some infirmity with us.<br> Every time we get together. Wow.<br> - Really?<br> - We're fighting.<br> Now, according<br> to Mrs. Osterhoff's butcher...<br> ...that is known as basic sex antagonism.<br> I call it...<br> Gypsy Madonna.<br> I call it love.<br> - What's that you said?<br> - He called me a Gypsy Madonna.<br> My hair hasn't been<br> that color in seven years.<br> Gypsy Madonna, Gypsy Mado...<br> Mom, where are you going?<br> The doctor told you not to walk.<br> If you want something,<br> tell me and I'll get it.<br> All right.<br> I want my scrapbook. It's in the cabinet.<br> Midnight and she wants scrapbooks yet.<br> It's the red one on top.<br> It's the first one I kept on you.<br> I got 10 of them now.<br> Every story and picture I could find.<br> And what I missed, Mrs. Osterhoff found.<br> - Is this it?<br> - Yeah, that's the one.<br> Believe it or not, Jen,<br> I've always been proud of my daughter.<br> - Is that me?<br> - Sure. Who did you think it was?<br> I tell you, Jen, I must be getting old.<br> I used to be able to rattle them off<br> word for word.<br> - Ah. Here it is.<br> - "'Gotham Today. ' By Tye Graham. "<br> That's him, Mom.<br> You don't say.<br> "One production number in the second act<br> featured a girl with auburn red hair.<br> She danced and sang one song,<br> 'Tenderly. '<br> She seemed to fill the stage<br> all by herself.<br> Among a crowd of born dance hall<br> hostesses, she was a... "<br> Gypsy Madonna.<br> You see?<br> "Her name is Jenny Stewart...<br> ...and she made the rest of the show<br> difficult to remember.<br> I kept looking for her again,<br> but she never returned until the finale.<br> I doubt that any man in the audience<br> was watching the principals.<br> I know I wasn't.<br> Tomorrow, I leave for the service...<br> ...and no more pleasant memories<br> could I carry with me...<br> ...than that short<br> but vivid glimpse of one Jenny Stewart. "<br> That's where<br> the "Gypsy Madonna" came from.<br> When it comes to Jenny Stewart...<br> ...the man who wrote this<br> could never be blind.<br> I wonder what he saw in me.<br> I wasn't that good then.<br> Maybe you forgot how good you was.<br> Put on that old record of yours,<br> "Tenderly. "<br> Go ahead.<br> The one you gave me on my...<br> Well, one of my earlier birthdays.<br> Now, don't mind the scratches.<br> It might sound a little tired,<br> but you'll see what I mean.<br> Incidentally, Jenny...<br> ...your father wasn't just somewhat bald<br> when I married him.<br> He was bald as a billiard ball. Ha!<br> Well, it's senseless music, Martha.<br> But it's Jenny.<br> Blatant and brash.<br> That's the way she is.<br> That's the way I see her.<br> Where did I put my pipe, please?<br> Where's Martha?<br> She left a few minutes ago.<br> How did you manage that?<br> It was easy.<br> She loves you.<br> How did you manage to get Charlie Maylor<br> on a plane to Cuba?<br> That was easy. He hates you.<br> How did you know about Charlie and me?<br> I'm psychic.<br> Also, I phoned Havana.<br> Look, Jenny, I told you, I'm not coming<br> to Philadelphia with you. That's final.<br> You should come.<br> If only to hear<br> your Gypsy Madonna singing.<br> I read that old review you wrote.<br> It was a little corny...<br> ...but find me a guy who can write<br> a love letter that isn't a little corny.<br> It was purely a professional opinion.<br> No more, no less.<br> Why don't you stop hiding?<br> You hide behind that keyboard.<br> - Cut it out.<br> - You hide behind the dog.<br> You hide behind<br> that smug look on your face.<br> - You also hide behind...<br> - Jenny, get out of here.<br> Why didn't you come right out<br> and tell me how you felt about me?<br> What were you afraid of?<br> That I'd say no?<br> Afraid I'd laugh at you<br> because you're blind?<br> Jenny, get out of here!<br> It's all right for you<br> to call yourself blind...<br> ...but you don't like it<br> when somebody else does, do you?<br> I finally did it.<br> It took a long time,<br> but I finally cracked your shell.<br> You really wrecked the joint.<br> I did a thorough job?<br> Yup.<br> Need help getting up?<br> No, thank you.<br> Then how about helping me up?<br> That's the first time I ever heard<br> Jenny Stewart ask for anything.<br> It's the first time<br> Jenny ever needed anything.<br> And I do need you, Tye.<br> I know you do.<br> You need me too.<br> I know that too.<br> Mm.<br> Guess I better start taking lessons.<br> What kind?<br> How to be a seeing eye.<br> How about Duchess?<br> Can she cook?<br> No.<br> Can she sing?<br> Not very well.<br> Believe me, Duchess has her limitations.<br>
