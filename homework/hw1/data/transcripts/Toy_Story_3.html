Wait a minute. Quiet!<br> No one's getting thrown out, okay?<br> We're all still here.<br> I mean, yeah,<br> we've lost friends along the way.<br> - Wheezy and Etch and...<br> - Bo Peep?<br> Yeah. Even Bo.<br> All good toys<br> who've gone on to new owners.<br> But through every yard sale, every<br> spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!<br> He must care about us,<br> or we wouldn't be here.<br> You wait.

But not right now!<br> Fellas, I know what to do.<br> What the heck?<br> - We should've done this years ago.<br> - Jessie, wait. What about Woody?<br> He's fine, Buzz.<br> Andy's taking him to college.<br> Now we need to go!<br> You're right. Come on.<br> - Buzz?<br> - Woody!<br> What's going on? Don't you know<br> this box is being donated?<br> It's under control, Woody.<br> We have a plan.<br> We're going to daycare!<br> Daycare?<br> What, have you all lost your marbles?<br> Well, didn't you see?<br> Andy threw us away.<br> No, no, no, no.<br> He was putting you in the attic.<br> Attic? So how did we<br> end up on the curb?<br> That was a mistake.<br> Andy's mom thought you were trash.<br> Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.<br> And called us junk!<br> Yeah, I know. It looks bad.<br> But, guys, you gotta believe me.<br> Sure thing, college boy!<br> Andy's moving on, Woody.<br> It's time we did the same.<br> Okay.

I can't believe<br> she would throw me away!<br> - Welcome to the club, toots.<br> - Okay, everyone, listen up.<br> We can get back to Andy's,<br> but we gotta move fast.<br> We'll hide under the seats<br> till we get back home.<br> Get it through your vinyl noggin,<br> Woody.<br> Andy doesn't want us anymore.<br> He was putting you in the attic!<br> He left us on the curb!<br> - All right, calm down! Both of you!<br> - Okay, fine. Fine.<br> Just wait till you see<br> what daycare's like.<br> - Why? What's it like?<br> - Daycare is a sad, lonely place<br> for washed-up old toys<br> who have no owners.<br> - Quite the charmer, aren't ya?<br> - You'll see.<br> As soon as we get to daycare,<br> you'll be begging to go home.<br> Can anyone see anything?<br> - There's a playground!<br> - Wow!<br> We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!<br> So much for sad and lonely, huh?<br> Okay.

Thank you.<br> - Thank you, buddy boy.<br> - Will I see you again?<br> - I'll see you tonight<br> in my dreams.<br> Ken, let's get a move on.<br> Barbie, come with me.<br> Live in my dream house.<br> I know it's crazy. I know we just met.<br> Heck, you don't know me<br> from G.I. Joe,<br> but when I look at you,<br> I feel like we were...<br> - Made for each other.<br> ...made for each other.<br> - Yay!<br> - Yes.<br> - Ken?<br> - Coming, Lotso.<br> This is so exciting!<br> Sounds like kids to me.<br> I want to get played with.<br> Why can't time go faster?<br> How many you reckon are out there?<br> They sound so sweet.<br> Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.<br> But we need to go home.<br> We can have<br> a whole new life here, Woody.<br> A chance to make kids happy again.<br> - Why don't you stay?<br> - Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.<br> - Come on, Woodster!<br> - You'll get played with.<br> - I can't. No.<br> - Stay here.<br> - You can make a new kid happy.<br> - No, no. Guys, really. No!<br> I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!<br> And if he wants us at college,<br> or in the attic,<br> well, then, our job is<br> to be there for him.<br> Now, I'm going home.<br> Anyone who wants to join me<br> is welcome. Come on, Buzz.<br> Buzz?<br> Our mission with Andy<br> is complete, Woody.<br> What?<br> And what's important now<br> is we stay together.<br> We wouldn't even be together<br> if it weren't for Andy!<br> Look under your boot, Buzz.<br> You, too, Jessie.<br> Whose name is written there?<br> Maybe Andy doesn't<br> care about us anymore.<br> Of course he does.<br> He cares about all of you!<br> He was putting you in the attic. I saw.<br> You can't just turn your back<br> on him now!<br> Woody, wake up! It's over!<br> Andy is all grown up!<br> Okay, fine. Perfect.<br> I can't believe how selfish you all are.<br> So this is it?<br> After all we've been through.<br> Bullseye, no. You need to stay.<br> Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"<br> Look,<br> I don't want you left alone<br> in the attic, okay? Now, stay.<br> Bonnie?<br> I gotta go.<br> Bonnie, you in here?<br> Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.<br> What... What the heck?<br> Now, that's better.<br> - Bonnie!<br> - Bluebells, cockleshells...<br> There you are.

Eenie, miny...<br> You're my favorite deputy.<br> - Bonnie!<br> - Coming!<br> Great.<br> It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.<br> Woody's going to college with Andy.<br> It's what he's always wanted.<br> He's crazy.<br> College is no place for a toy.<br> Toys are for playtime.<br> Speaking of playtime,<br> they're lining up out there!<br> - How many?<br> - There must be dozens.<br> I can hardly wait!<br> Places, everyone!<br> At last! I'm gonna get played with!<br> - Rex?<br> - Come to papa.<br> There's a snake in my boot.<br> I'd like to join your posse, boys,<br> but first I'm gonna sing a little song.<br> A sheriff!<br> Move over, Mr. Pricklepants.<br> We have a guest.<br> You want some coffee?<br> It's good for you. But don't drink<br> too much, or you'll have to...<br> Be right back!<br> Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.<br> Can you tell me where I am?<br> The guy's just asking a question.<br> Well, excuse me.<br> I'm trying to stay in character.<br> My name's Buttercup.<br> You've met Baron von Shush.<br> Hello, I'm Trixie.<br> Guys, hey. Guys, look,<br> I don't know where I am.<br> We're either in a caf in Paris<br> or a coffee shop in New Jersey.<br> I'm pretty sure<br> I just came back from the doctor<br> with life-changing news.<br> We do a lot of improv here. Just<br> stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.<br> - No, no, no, no. I...<br> - Who wants lunch?<br> It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.<br> Somebody's poisoned the water hole.<br> Poison?<br> Who would do such a mean thing?<br> The scary witch! Look out!<br> She's using her witch-y powers!<br> "I know where to hide."<br> She'll never find us in here.<br> What's wrong?<br> She found us! We need a spaceship<br> to get away from the witch!<br> - You're doing great!<br> - Are you classically-trained?<br> Look, I just need to know<br> how to get out of here!<br> There is no way out.<br> Just kidding. Door's right over there.<br> Well, cowboy, you just<br> jumped right in, didn't ya? I'm Dolly.<br> - Woody.<br> - Woody?<br> Really? You're gonna stick with that?<br> 'Cause now's your chance<br> to change it, new room and all.<br> That's coming from a doll<br> named Dolly.<br> - Who's the new guy?<br> - Are you a real cowboy?<br> - Well, actually...<br> - 'Course he's not, pea brain.<br> - He don't even have a hat.<br> - I do too have... My hat!<br> - Told ya.<br> - I found a spaceship!<br> Showtime.<br> Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.<br> Close your tray tables. Hold on.<br> It might get a little bumpy.<br> Three, two, one, blastoff!<br> You saved us, cowboy.<br> You're our hero.<br> I got a kink in my slink.<br> My tail! Where's my tail?<br> Someone need a hand?<br> - Where's my nose?<br> - Here it is.<br> - Here's your arm.<br> - Give me that. That's mine.<br> Honey, the mustache?<br> I don't recall playtime being<br> quite that strenuous.<br> Andy never played with us like that.<br> We're just gonna have to<br> make the best of it.<br> But these toddlers,<br> they don't know how to play with us.<br> - They're too young!<br> - Yeah, they're sticky.<br> Well, we should be<br> in the Butterfly Room.<br> - With the big kids!<br> - That's right.<br> - Yeah, you said it.<br> - We'll get this straightened out.<br> I'll go talk to Lotso<br> about moving us to the other room.<br> Blast. Try that one.<br> It's locked!<br> - Same here.<br> - Try the windows.<br> Negatory.<br> It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.<br> Finest childproof lock in the world.<br> - We're trapped!<br> - Wait.<br> Did anyone notice the transom?<br> Oh, great. How do we get up there?<br> All right, everyone. On three!<br> One, two...<br> - Three!<br> - Whoa!<br> Let go!<br> Go!<br> - He did it!<br> - Yes, sir!<br> Way to go, Buzz!<br> Yeah, you think<br> they had a fun playtime?<br> They might hear you.<br> - Okay, now you start.<br> - I...<br> - Love...<br> - You.<br> See? That time, I said "love."<br> Okay, now me first.<br> - Okay, okay, okay.<br> - I...<br> - Love...<br> - You.<br> You see what I mean?<br> It changes every time.<br> You are so smart.<br> Come on, Romeo. We're late.<br> - I'll wait up for you.<br> - Kisses!<br> All right, place your bets.<br> Come on, everybody.<br> - Come on. Any splits?<br> - Heya. Bring it here.<br> - All right.<br> - Here we go.<br> - Come on, horsey, come on!<br> - Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.<br> - Gobble, gobble, baby.<br> - Come on, horsey.<br> Come on, duck.<br> - All right, that's it. No more bets.<br> - Come on! Right here.<br> Let me have the duck, let me have<br> the duck, let me have the duck!<br> Here is a duck.<br> - I won!<br> - Ah, man!<br> - Well, Stretch takes the round.<br> - You lost!<br> Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.<br> - Coyote's wild.<br> - Here, here.<br> - Two greens here.<br> - Changing two double A's.<br> Hey, what do you guys think<br> of the new recruits? Any keepers?<br> Oh, please! Landfill!<br> - Cowgirl? Dinosaur?<br> - Toddler fodder.<br> But that space guy, he could be useful.<br> He ain't the sharpest knife in the<br> place where they keep the knives.<br> Neither are you, Chunk.<br> You got a little keeper yourself,<br> didn't you, Ken?<br> Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.<br> Aw, Mr. Softy over here.<br> What do you expect from a girl's toy?<br> I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not!<br> Why do you guys keep saying that?<br> All them toys are disposable.<br> We'll be lucky if they last us a week.<br> Well, well. Looky who we have here.<br> Let me go!<br> Take him to the library.<br> No!<br> Woody, what are you doing?<br> I gotta get outta here.<br> - You're leaving?<br> - But didn't you have fun today?<br> Well, of course I did,<br> more than I've had in years,<br> but, you see,<br> I belong to someone else.<br> - Who's "Yid-nuh"?<br> - I believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."<br> Guys, it says "Andy."<br> He's my Bonnie.<br> And he's leaving soon.<br> I gotta get home.<br> - Where's home?<br> - Elm Street. 234 Elm.<br> - You guys have a map?<br> - We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?<br> I'll fire up the computer.<br> Unhand me, you cowards!<br> I demand to talk to Lotso!<br> Zip it, Buck Rogers.<br> You don't talk to Lotso<br> till we say you can...<br> Ken? What's goin' on here?<br> Why is this toy tied up?<br> He got out, Lotso.<br> "Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.<br> This isn't how we treat our guests.<br> F-A-oh, my Schwarz.<br> There you go. I'm so sorry.<br> - Lotso, there's been a mistake.<br> - A mistake?<br> The children in the Caterpillar Room<br> are not age-appropriate<br> for me and my friends.<br> We respectfully request<br> a transfer to the Butterfly Room.<br> Well, request granted!<br> - But, Lotso...<br> - Hush now, Kenneth.<br> This toy's shown initiative, leadership.<br> Why, I'd say<br> we've found ourselves a keeper.<br> Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!<br> We're calling you up<br> to the big leagues, son.<br> From now on,<br> you'll have anything you want.<br> Excellent. I'll go get my friends.<br> Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.<br> Those Caterpillar kids<br> need someone to play with.<br> But my friends don't belong there.<br> None of us do, I agree.<br> Which is why,<br> for the good of our community,<br> we ask the newer toys,<br> the stronger ones,<br> to take on the hardships<br> the rest of us can't bear anymore.<br> Well, I guess that makes sense.<br> But I can't accept.<br> We're a family. We stay together.<br> Family man, huh? I understand.<br> Put him back in the timeout chair.<br> What are ya... Unhand me!<br> Bring in the Bookworm.<br> Here it is.<br> It was filed under "Lightyear."<br> Let's see here.<br> "Accessories. Maintenance."<br> Here we go.<br> "Remove screws to access<br> battery compartment."<br> What are you doing?<br> Stop!<br> Let go of me!<br> "To return your Buzz Lightyear action<br> figure to its original factory settings..."<br> No!<br> "...slide the switch from<br> Play to Demo."<br> Stop! No! No! No!<br> - What was that?<br> - Sounds like it came from the hall.<br> I'll see what it was.<br> What do you see? Anything?<br> No, just a dark hallway and...<br> Wait. Wait!<br> I see Andy!<br> - What?<br> - That's impossible.<br> No, no, I really see him. In his room.<br> My other eye! The one I left behind.<br> This is so weird. He's packing up.<br> Here comes Buster.<br> Out of the way! Get away!<br> Okay, Andy's out in the hall.<br> He's looking in the attic.<br> Wait, there's Mom.<br> Why is he so upset?<br> Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!<br> He's looking for us.<br> Andy's looking for us!<br> He's looking for us?<br> So Andy does want us.<br> I knew it! I just knew it!<br> I think he did mean<br> to put us in the attic.<br> Well, then,<br> Woody was telling the truth.<br> - Holy cow!<br> - And you didn't believe him.<br> Hey, you didn't believe him first!<br> Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!<br> - Lotso!<br> - Hey, there.<br> How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?<br> Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?<br> There's been a mistake.<br> We have to go.<br> Go? Why, you just got here.<br> In the nick of time, too.<br> We were runnin' low on volunteers<br> for the little ones.<br> They just love new toys,<br> now, don't they?<br> "Love"? We've been chewed,<br> kicked, drooled on.<br> Just look at my pocketbook!<br> Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.<br> You ain't leavin' Sunnyside.<br> "Sweet potato"!<br> Who do you think you're talking to?<br> I have over 30 accessories,<br> and I deserve more respect...<br> That's better.<br> Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth,<br> except me.<br> Give it back, you furry air freshener!<br> Come on, guys. We're goin' home.<br> Whoa there, missy.<br> You're not goin' anywhere.<br> Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?<br> Buzz! You're back!<br> Buzz?<br> Hey!<br> Look out!<br> What are you, nuts?<br> Buzz!<br> Prisoners disabled,<br> Commander Lotso!<br> - Buzz, what are you doing?<br> - Silence, minions of Zurg!<br> You're in the custody<br> of the Galactic Alliance!<br> - "Zurg"?<br> - "Galactic Alliance"?<br> Oh, boy.<br> Good work, Lightyear.<br> Now, lock 'em up!<br> Yes, sir!<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> Buzz! We're your friends!<br> Spare me your lies, temptress.<br> Your emperor's defeated,<br> and I'm immune to<br> your bewitching good looks.<br> Hey, Mongo!<br> Keep your paws off my wife!<br> Hey! Let go of me,<br> you drooling doofus!<br> Not him.<br> I think this potato needs to<br> learn himself some manners.<br> Take him to the box.<br> Hey! Put me down, you moron!<br> Where are you taking me?<br> Bad baby! Bad baby!<br> Ken? What's going on?<br> Barbie! I told you to wait<br> in the Dream House.<br> What are you doing to my friends?<br> Get in there!<br> - Barbie, wait!<br> - Don't touch me.<br> - We're through!<br> - Barbie! I did...<br> And give me my scarf back!<br> Lightyear! Explain our<br> overnight accommodations.<br> Sir, yes, sir!<br> Prisoners sleep in their cells.<br> Any prisoner caught outside their cell<br> spends the night in the box.<br> Roll call at dusk and dawn.<br> Any prisoner misses roll call,<br> spends the night in the box.<br> Prisoners do not speak<br> unless spoken to.<br> Any prisoner talks back,<br> spends the night...<br> In the box! We get it.<br> At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.<br> But remember, they'll say anything<br> to make you doubt yourself.<br> Don't worry, Commander.<br> Any doubt I had got pounded<br> out of me at the academy.<br> Listen up, folks.<br> We got a way of doin' things<br> here at Sunnyside.<br> If you start at the bottom,<br> pay your dues,<br> life here can be a dream come true!<br> But if you break our rules,<br> step outta line,<br> try to check out early,<br> well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.<br> Woody! What did you do to him?<br> You all get a good night's rest.<br> You got a full day<br> of playtime tomorrow.<br> Who's Velocistar237?<br> That's just a dinosaur toy<br> down the street.<br> That's nothing.<br> Let me just take care of that.<br> - Just a dinosaur.<br> - All right.<br> Sycamore. Okay, enter!<br> Please don't be far. Please, please!<br> Right around the corner?<br> It's right around the corner!<br> I'm going to college! Look at me!<br> I'm big toy on campus! Hello!<br> - Hey, I'll see you at the sock hop.<br> - Okay, Potsie.<br> Hey, listen. If any of you guys<br> ever get to Sunnyside Daycare,<br> you tell 'em Woody made it home.<br> - You came from Sunnyside?<br> - But how'd you escape?<br> Well, it wasn't easy.<br> What do you mean "escape"?<br> Sunnyside is a place<br> of ruin and despair.<br> Ruled by an evil bear<br> who smells of strawberries.<br> Lotso?<br> The guy may seem plush<br> and huggable on the outside,<br> but inside, he's a monster.<br> But... How do you know that?<br> Chuckles. He'll tell you.<br> Yeah, I knew Lotso.<br> He was a good toy. A friend.<br> Me and him,<br> we had the same kid, Daisy.<br> A was there<br> when Lotso got unwrapped.<br> Daisy loved us all.<br> But Lotso,<br> Lotso was special.<br> They did everything together.<br> You've never seen<br> a kid and a toy more in love.<br> One day, we took a drive.<br> Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.<br> After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.<br> She never came back.<br> Lotso wouldn't give up.<br> It took forever,<br> but we finally made it back to Daisy's.<br> But by then, it was too late.<br> Something changed that day<br> inside Lotso.<br> Something snapped.<br> She replaced us. Come on!<br> - No, she only replaced you!<br> - She replaced all of us.<br> Didn't she?<br> She don't love you no more!<br> Now come on!<br> We were lost. Cast off.<br> Unloved. Unwanted.<br> Then we found Sunnyside.<br> But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.<br> He wasn't anyone's friend.<br> He took over Sunnyside<br> and rigged the whole system.<br> So how'd you get out?<br> I got broke.<br> Bonnie found me, took me home.<br> Other toys, they weren't so lucky.<br> It ain't right what Lotso done.<br> New toys,<br> they don't stand a chance.<br> - But my friends are in there.<br> - You can't go back.<br> Returning now would be suicide!<br> But what about your Andy?<br> Isn't he leaving for college?<br> Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!<br> Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.<br> But he ain't ever comin' back.<br> Rise and shine, campers!<br> Commander Lotso, sir!<br> All quiet, nothing to report.<br> Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.<br> We need ya back at Star Command.<br> Wait! What've you done<br> with my husband?<br> Big Baby.<br> Sweetheart!<br> It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand<br> and a couple of Lincoln Logs.<br> I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.<br> You all get ready.<br> You got a play-date with destiny!<br> Hello?<br> You shouldn't have<br> come back, cowboy.<br> They've cracked down hard since<br> you left. More guards, more patrols.<br> You and your friends<br> ain't ever getting out of here now.<br> I made it out once.<br> You got lucky once. Want my advice?<br> Keep your heads down. You'll survive.<br> Yeah, for how long?<br> I've been here years.<br> They'll never break me.<br> There's only one way<br> toys leave this place.<br> Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.<br> Then it's off to the dump.<br> Look, I appreciate<br> your concern, old-timer.<br> But we have a kid waiting for us.<br> Now, we're leaving.<br> If you'd help us, one toy to another,<br> I'd sure be grateful.<br> Well, if you're gonna get out,<br> first thing you gotta get through's<br> the doors.<br> Locked, every night. Inside and out.<br> Keys are left on a hook in the office.<br> Got it. What else?<br> Lotso has trucks<br> patrolling all night long.<br> Hallway, lobby, playground.<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> What about the wall?<br> Eight-feet high. Cinder block.<br> No way through it.<br> You go over or under.<br> That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.<br> It's not.<br> Your real problem's the monkey.<br> The monkey's the eye in the sky.<br> He sees everything.<br> Classrooms.<br> Hallways.<br> Even the playground.<br> You can unlock doors,<br> sneak past guards, climb the wall,<br> but if you don't take out that monkey,<br> you ain't going nowhere.<br> You wanna get out of here?<br> Get rid of that monkey!<br> Recess! Come on, kids!<br> Hey, guys.<br> - Woody?<br> - Woody!<br> Woody!<br> - Hey, hey, hey, buddy!<br> - Thank goodness!<br> - You're alive!<br> - 'Course I'm alive!<br> Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?<br> Lotso did something to him!<br> He thinks he's a real<br> Space Ranger again.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Return of the astro-nut.<br> Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.<br> I was wrong.<br> Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.<br> No, no, it's my fault<br> for leaving you guys.<br> From now on, we stick together.<br> But Andy's leavin' for college.<br> College? Hog-tie the mailman!<br> We gotta get you home<br> before Andy leaves tomorrow!<br> Tomorrow? But that means...<br> It means<br> we're busting out of here, tonight.<br> - What? Impossible!<br> - But there's no way out of here!<br> No, there is one way out.<br> One way.<br> Okay, here's what we're gonna do.<br> - Springy dog.<br> - Present.<br> Green guys.<br> - Cowgirl.<br> - Here.<br> Horse.<br> - Piggy bank.<br> - Yo.<br> - Tyrannosaurus.<br> - Here.<br> - Barbie.<br> - Here.<br> Potato Head.<br> Potato Head?<br> Hey! Hey!<br> Tuberous root-man! Wake up!<br> Impossible!<br> Hey!<br> Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?<br> That's Mr. Potato Head to you,<br> smoothie.<br> Well, well, well. You're turning out to<br> be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?<br> What did you think you were<br> gonna do? Waltz right out of here?<br> Yeah, and I would've got away<br> with it, too,<br> if it weren't for you meddling toys!<br> You ascot-wearing pink-noser!<br> You're not a toy! You're an accessory!<br> You're a purse with legs.<br> Take him back to the box.<br> No! No, not the box! I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean it! I like ascots.<br> Really. No, no, no!<br> Okay, check.<br> Good work, Lightyear. All right,<br> resume your space-guy-thingy.<br> Yes, sir, well-groomed man!<br> Ken! Ken?<br> What do you want?<br> I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go<br> to the Butterfly Room. With you!<br> Yeah, well, you should've<br> thought of that yesterday.<br> I was wrong.<br> I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.<br> In your Dream House.<br> Please take me away from this!<br> Take me away!<br> Darn it, Barbie!<br> Okay, but things<br> are complicated around here.<br> - You gotta do what I say.<br> - I will, Ken! I promise!<br> Wait. I'll do anything!<br> I'll change your diapers!<br> Go get the tape!<br> And this is where the magic happens.<br> Look at all your clothes!<br> I can't believe<br> you never brought me up here!<br> - Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!<br> - I know, I know, I know.<br> Check this out! Kung fu fighting.<br> Campus hero<br> with matching sports pennant, huh?<br> Flower power! Oh, Ken!<br> No one appreciates clothes<br> here, Barbie. No one.<br> Ken, would you<br> model a few outfits for me?<br> Just a few?<br> Go get the key.<br> Where is it, where is it?<br> Where's the key?<br> Where's the key? Bingo!<br> Hey! What do you think you're doing?<br> I told you,<br> keep your hands off of my stuff!<br> Make a move, porky!<br> Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!<br> - Hey! Hey!<br> - Take that, walnut-brain.<br> No wonder you're extinct.<br> Hey, you can't hit each other.<br> That's my job!<br> Help! Prison riot!<br> Get the tortilla.<br> - Ready?<br> - Ready.<br> Barbie?<br> No more games, Ken!<br> What did Lotso do to Buzz?<br> And how do we switch him back?<br> You can't make me talk. You can't!<br> But I'd like to see you try.<br> Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.<br> Barbie! Those were vintage!<br> It's okay. All right, go ahead,<br> rip 'em, I don't care.<br> They're a dime a dozen.<br> Glitter tux.<br> Who cares? Who cares?<br> Sequins are tacky. Who cares?<br> A Nehru jacket.<br> Barbie! Not the Nehru.<br> This is from what, 1967?<br> The groovy formal collection, yes!<br> - What a shame.<br> - Oh, no, no, no! No!<br> There's an instruction manual!<br> Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!<br> Where's that manual?<br> I don't know why<br> this couldn't wait until morning, Ken,<br> but here you go.<br> What's takin' so doggone long?<br> So how do we fix Buzz?<br> What are you looking at, feathers?<br> Hey!<br> Yeah, fly away, you coward.<br> Well, that's just great.<br> Help! Prison riot!<br> - Mayday! Mayday!<br> - Give it up. No one can hear you.<br> - What?<br> - I said, "No one can hear you."<br> - What?<br> - He said, "No one can..."<br> Shush! Will you be quiet?<br> Woody! You're back!<br> Stop him! Don't let him get out!<br> Star Command! I've been<br> taken hostage by my own prisoners.<br> Quick! Open his back.<br> There's a switch!<br> Unhand me, Zurg scum!<br> The Galactic Courts<br> will show you no mercy.<br> It's not working. Why is it<br> not working? Where's the manual?<br> Here we go! There should be<br> a little hole under the switch.<br> - Little hole, got it!<br> - "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,<br> - "insert paperclip..."<br> - Rex, use your finger!<br> What?<br> - Okay, now what?<br> - All right, let's see.<br> "Caution. Do not hold button<br> for more than five seconds."<br> It's not my fault!<br> - Now what did you do?<br> - I just did what you told me!<br> Amigos! We're all amigos.<br> We gotta switch him back.<br> - Well, how do we do that?<br> - I don't know. That part's in Spanish.<br> We don't have time for this.<br> Come on, El Buzzo.<br> Good luck, cowboy.<br> Here they come.<br> Come on, Buzz!<br> What took you so long?<br> Things got complicated.<br> Where's Potato Head?<br> We haven't seen him.<br> Buzz.<br> Did you fix Buzz?<br> - Sort of.<br> - Behind you.<br> Someone's coming.<br> You would not believe<br> what I've been through tonight.<br> Darling! Are you okay?<br> I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.<br> You've lost weight. And so tall.<br> You're a sight for detachable eyes.<br> All clear.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> We're almost there.<br> Back up. Back up!<br> Come on.<br> Woody!<br> Come on. We're almost there.<br> Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.<br> Way to go, Buzz. Come on.<br> - Is it safe?<br> - I guess I'll find out.<br> - Woody? You okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> Come on down. But not all at once.<br> - What did he say?<br> - I think he said, "All at once."<br> No. No. No, no, no, no, no!<br> - Geronimo!<br> - Look out!<br> Thanks, Jess.<br> Almost there, guys.<br> Slink, you think you can make it?<br> Well, I might be old,<br> but I still got a spring in my step.<br> - He did it!<br> - All right, Slinkykins.<br> Okay, climb across.<br> You lost, little doggie?<br> Well, well. Look who's back.<br> I'm sorry, cowboy.<br> They broke me.<br> What are y'all doing?<br> Running back to your kid?<br> He don't want you no more.<br> - That's a lie.<br> - Is it?<br> Tell me this, Sheriff.<br> If your kid loves you so much,<br> why is he leaving?<br> You think you're special, cowboy?<br> You're a piece of plastic.<br> You were made to be thrown away.<br> Speak of the devil.<br> Now, we need toys<br> in our Caterpillar Room<br> and you need to avoid that truck.<br> Why don't you come on back,<br> join our family again?<br> This isn't a family! It's a prison!<br> You're a liar and a bully!<br> And I'd rather rot in this dumpster<br> than join any family of yours!<br> Jessie's right! Authority should derive<br> from the consent of the governed,<br> not from the threat of force.<br> If that's what you want.<br> Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.<br> She's a Barbie doll, Ken.<br> There's a hundred million just like her.<br> Not to me, there's not.<br> Fine. Then why don't you join her!<br> Oh, Ken!<br> Everyone, listen!<br> Sunnyside could be cool and groovy<br> if we treated each other fair.<br> It's Lotso.<br> He's made us into a pyramid,<br> and he put himself on top!<br> Anyone concur with Ken?<br> I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.<br> Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.<br> Chew on that<br> when you're at the dump.<br> Wait! What about Daisy?<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> Daisy? You used to do<br> everything with her?<br> - Yeah? Then she threw us out.<br> - No.<br> - She lost you.<br> - She replaced us!<br> She replaced you.<br> And if you couldn't have her<br> then no one could.<br> You lied to Big Baby<br> and you've been lying ever since.<br> - Where'd you get that?<br> - She loved you, Lotso.<br> She never loved me.<br> As much as any kid ever loved a toy.<br> Mama.<br> What? You want your mommy back?<br> She never loved you.<br> Don't be such a baby!<br> Push 'em in. All of 'em!<br> This is what happens<br> when you dummies try to think.<br> We're all just trash, waiting to be<br> thrown away! That's all a toy is!<br> Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!<br> No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!<br> - He's gone!<br> - Holy cow.<br> Come on. Hurry!<br> For crying out loud!<br> Woody!<br> Oh, boy. Incoming!<br> Come on!<br> Barbie, no!<br> Woody!<br> No!<br> Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?<br> Of course not, you imbecile.<br> We're doomed!<br> Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.<br> We all here?

What do we do?<br> The claw.<br> You know all that bad stuff I said<br> about Andy's attic?<br> I take it all back.<br> - You're darn tootin'.<br> - You said it.<br> Oh, darling. You were so brave.<br> - You saved our lives.<br> - And we are eternally grateful.<br> My boys!<br> Daddy!<br> Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?<br> Yeah. I'd like to loosen his stitchin'.<br> Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.<br> - Hey!<br> - What you got?<br> I had me one of these<br> when I was a kid.<br> Strawberries.<br> Hey, buddy. You might wanna<br> keep your mouth shut.<br> Come on, Woody.<br> We gotta get you home.<br> - That's right, college boy.<br> - Wait.<br> What about you guys? I mean,<br> maybe the attic's<br> not such a great idea.<br> - We're Andy's toys, Woody.<br> - We'll be there for him, together.<br> - I just hope he hasn't left yet.<br> - Wait a minute!<br> Wait, I'll check!<br> Andy's still packing.<br> But he's almost done!<br> - He lives halfway across town.<br> - We'll never get there in time!<br> - Come on, Buster.<br> - Is that it, honey? You got everything?<br> Yeah. Just a few more boxes<br> in my room.<br> Okay. Come on.<br> That's enough. That's enough.<br> That's enough!<br> All right. Go. Go, go!<br> Okay. All clear.<br> There you are.<br> - There you go.<br> - Buzz.<br> - This isn't goodbye.<br> - Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.<br> Yeah, but not too much fun.<br> - Woody, take care of Andy.<br> - Yeah.<br> He's a good kid.<br> Tell him to get a haircut.<br> Sure thing.<br> Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?<br> 'Course I will. Besides, I know about<br> - Buzz's Spanish mode.<br> - My what?<br> Honey, you want some food<br> for the road?<br> I'll get something on the way.<br> You know where to find us, cowboy.<br> Did you say goodbye to Molly?<br> Mom, we've said goodbye<br> like 10 times.<br> Andy.<br> Mom, it's okay.<br> I know.

I'm gonna<br> miss you. I'm gonna miss you.<br> - I'm gonna miss you.<br> - Don't, Andy.<br> Good boy.<br> He's telling you to go already.<br> Come on. Get the rest of your things.<br> Okay, Buster.<br> Now don't let Molly near my stuff.<br> Hey.<br> Hey, Mom! So, you really think<br> I should donate these?<br> It's up to you, honey.<br> Whatever you wanna do.<br> "Don't go in there!<br> The bakery is haunted!"<br> "Are you crazy?<br> You'll wake up all the ghosts."<br> "Look out!<br> The ghosts are throwing pies!"<br> Mom.<br> - Andy?<br> - Hi.<br> Wow. Look at you.<br> Well, I hear you're off to college.<br> Yeah.

Mr. And Mrs.<br> You gotta keep 'em together,<br> 'cause they're madly in love.<br> Now Slinky here is<br> as loyal as any dog you could want.<br> And Hamm,<br> he'll keep your money safe,<br> but he's also one of the most dastardly<br> villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop.<br> These little dudes<br> are from a strange alien world.<br> Pizza Planet.<br> And this<br> is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!<br> Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!<br> He's sworn to protect the galaxy<br> from the evil Emperor Zurg.<br> To infinity and beyond!<br> Now, you gotta promise<br> to take good care of these guys.<br> They mean a lot to me.<br> My cowboy!<br> Woody? What's he doing in there?<br> - "There's a snake in my boot."<br> - Wha?<br> There's a snake in my boot.<br> Now, Woody, he's been my pal<br> for as long as I can remember.<br> He's brave, like a cowboy should be.<br> And kind. And smart.<br> But the thing that makes Woody<br> special is he'll never give up on you.<br> Ever.<br> He'll be there for you, no matter what.<br> You think you can<br> take care of him for me?<br> Okay then.<br> Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop's attacking<br> the haunted bakery!<br> The ghosts are getting away.<br> Woody'll stop 'em!<br> Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!<br> And we'll actually need the rocket.<br> They're getting away!<br> Come on, Bullseye!<br> We need to get in the spaceship.<br> The volcano is gonna erupt.<br> Look!
