                        Last night I had an ugly nightmare.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> What happened, man?<br> I'm lying down in my bed.<br> Then I get up...<br> and there's my mother,<br> may she rest in peace...<br> seated in a chair<br> with a plastic bag over her head...<br> and she can't breathe.<br> And I can't help her.<br> Fuck.<br> What do we do?<br> We'll give them a half hour.<br> Who are they?<br> Don't worry.<br> It's just the police.<br> This is a private road.<br> You have to have a permit.<br> - Do you have a permit?<br> - I don't have a permit.<br> Do you have a permit?<br> Well, then, we have a problem.<br> Can we buy a permit?<br> Yeah, but it's gonna cost you.<br> - How much?<br> - Four hundred pesos.<br> You too-- 400 pesos.<br> What's underneath the tarp?<br> - Boxes of food.<br> - Show me.<br> Lay down on the ground, sweetie.<br> You're under arrest.<br> Yeah, you guys are screwed!<br> What's your name?<br> Javier Rodrguez Rodrguez.<br> Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.<br> You've done an excellent job.<br> But we'll take over from here.<br> Put the prisoners in the Suburban<br> and impound the truck.<br> How did you find out about this?<br> A little bird told me.<br> What's the name<br> ofyour little bird?<br> It doesn't have a name.<br> Those fucking anonymous ones!<br> For an officer of the state police...<br> you're very well-informed.<br> - Hey, was that General Salazar?<br> - The Big Boss himself.<br> What is he doing around here?<br> Up to something. I don't know.<br> They took our handcuffs, Manolo.<br> This informant, paid by police,<br> using taxpayers' dollars...<br> to continue his felony<br> drug habit, was the link...<br> that allowed the police<br> to raid a private farm,<br> a working farm where honest<br> Americans make their living.<br> The government, in its haste,<br> has hired an army of criminals...<br> - whose allegiance to the truth<br> is at best questionable.<br> - Mr. Rodman...<br> it's a shame that your client<br> didn't use as much sense...<br> in choosing what he planted...<br> as he did<br> in choosing his attorney,<br> but, lately,<br> the only variation...<br> I'm hearing in your argument<br> is the name of your client.<br> You can stand here all day and argue<br> the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates,<br> but you're not<br> gonna convince me...<br> that our government has not sanctioned<br> the use of anonymous informants.<br> Furthermore,<br> there is no sacred protection<br> of property rights in our country.<br> You grow marijuana on your farm,<br> be it an ounce or an acre,<br> that farm can be seized...<br> and that farm can be sold.<br> What the hell is that?<br> You can tell a lot about somebody<br> from this stuff.<br> - It's from your friends<br> at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.<br> - A fishing rod.<br> - What do you think they want?<br> - Depends what state they're from.<br> Uh...

Let me tell one joke.<br> I'm gonna tell you a joke.<br> All right, why are hurricane<br> named after women?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Because when they arrive,<br> they're wet and wild.<br> When they leave, they take<br> your house and your car.<br> - It's true.<br> - You didn't find that funny?<br> I chuckled. Damn.<br> - Fellas... that's us.<br> - Yo.<br> Okay, that's the van. Don't make<br> your move until they get Ruiz outside.<br> I told you there was<br> nothing to worry about.<br> I got another joke.<br> - Come on. Please.<br> -Just one more.

Anyone? Anyone?<br> Okay, Aeschylus it is.<br> His trilogy? The Oresteia.<br> This is fucking beautiful. Can anyone--<br> Can anyone stop the Seth machine?<br> - No.<br> - That's correct.

Come on.<br> We've got to go.<br> Put this down here, okay?<br> That's where Tiger Woods keeps it.<br> Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> - Okay.<br> David, you're gonna have to promise me,<br> no swinging the club in the car.<br> Okay.<br> Until you officially take over the<br> Office of National Drug Control Policy,<br> under no circumstances will you speak<br> to the press unprotected...<br> without going through this office...<br> or having someone in the room.<br> There are a lot of interests<br> in this town.<br> Right now,<br> they're scared of you.<br> The reason they're scared<br> of you: Technically, you have<br> veto powers over their budgets.<br> You'll also be meeting<br> senators and congressmen,<br> each with a specially<br> prepared question.<br> They're questions designed for<br> one thing-- to make them look smart.<br> If you lecture them,<br> they won't think you respect them.<br> If you treat them<br> with utter humility, they will.<br> This is about your respect for them<br> and the president's respect for them.<br> Speaking of which, when he<br> gets back from Russia and China,<br> we'll get you two together for<br> some face time, let you two catch up.<br> Also, one month from today,<br> you will give your first<br> official press conference.<br> In it, you will outline the president's<br> strategy for winning the war on drugs.<br> Judge, I just want to be<br> clear about one thing:<br> I am not a partisan person,<br> I am an issue person.<br> Over the course of the next few weeks,<br> if you allow me,<br> I will bring you up to speed<br> on an incredible array of issues,<br> the most important ofwhich,<br> in my opinion, Mexico.<br> I know everyone you're going to meet.<br> I know what they want and why.<br> It is important<br> that they like you.<br> It is not important<br> that they like me.<br> That is why<br> I can help protect you.<br> Like you protected Landry?<br> I see where you're going with that.<br> If I could say one thing: Basically,<br> a guy like Landry is so autocratic,<br> he doesn't even know how<br> to let himself be helped.<br> There's a political component<br> to this job that the general<br> didn't have any patience for.<br> General, Bob Wakefield.<br> General, Bob Wakefield.<br> -Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.<br> - A pleasure to meet you, sir.<br> -Jeff, you want to excuse us?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'll be right outside.<br> - Have a seat.<br> - Thank you.<br> You've done a fine job, General.<br> The Office of National<br> Drug Control Policy...<br> is in better shape<br> than when you found it.<br> I'm not sure I made<br> the slightest difference.<br> I tried. I really did.<br> I think there are some positive signs.<br> The work's just started.<br> I plan on seeing it through.<br> You can count on that.<br> You're here for two years,<br> three maximum.<br> What'd they offer you,<br> a court appointment?<br> District? Appeals?<br> Not Supreme.<br> This is a tough enough job.<br> I plan on focusing on this.<br> You know, when Khrushchev<br> was forced out,<br> he sat down, he wrote two letters<br> and gave them to his successor.<br> He said, "When you get yourself<br> into a situation you can't get out of,<br> "open the first letter,<br> and you'll be saved.<br> "And when you get yourself into<br> another situation you can't get out of,<br> open the second letter."<br> Well, soon enough, this guy<br> found himself in a tight place,<br> so he opened the first letter,<br> which said, " Blame everything on me."<br> So, he blamed the old man.<br> It worked like a charm.<br> He got himself into a second situation<br> he couldn't get out of,<br> and he opened the second letter.<br> It said, "Sit down<br> and write two letters."<br> Yeah.<br> Don't you want to know<br> what kind of car it is?<br> - It's a brown Ford Explorer.<br> - It was here. It's been stolen.<br> I want to file a report.<br> A report will not help you<br> find your car.<br> - The police won't find your car.<br> - You are the police.<br> - You call this man...<br> and he'll find your car.<br> - I don't get it.<br> How is this guy gonna know<br> who has our car?<br> The police will tell him.<br> Why will they tell him,<br> and they won't tell us?<br> Because we pay him, stupid.<br> Right? And he pays the police,<br> and suddenly our car appears.<br> Es correct.<br> Es correct.<br> Just give him the money.<br> Give him the money.<br> - Let's start moving to the sidewalk.<br> - Here, take it.<br> - No. No, no.<br> - No, please, take it.<br> Let's start moving to the sidewalk.<br> Let's go to the sidewalk.<br> Call the man.<br> Have a nice day.<br> -Javier Rodriguez.<br> - Si.<br> We want you to come with us.<br> - Where?<br> - It's just a short trip.<br> Follow me.<br> Bien.<br> I would say one thing<br> to you,Judge,<br> and that's you're never gonna solve<br> this problem on the supply side.<br> As long as that demand<br> is out there in our cities,<br> Mexico bashing is not gonna do<br> a damn thing for you.<br> We in the legal drug business--<br> Merck and Pfizer and the rest<br> of my very important clients--<br> realize that we're not fighting<br> a war here with a traditional<br> winner and loser.<br> I don't know that<br> you can win this war.<br> Everybody says we want<br> to declare war on drugs,<br> but if 25% of high school seniors<br> are using drugs--<br> -If you reduce that to 10,<br> that's a great improvement.<br> - Right.<br> I'll congratulate you.<br> That would be a phenomenal achievement,<br> but you'd still have 10%<br> habitually using drugs.<br> Can I get a scotch and soda, please?<br> The price of coke<br> and heroin has dropped,<br> but purity has increased.<br> All this law enforcement<br> has really achieved is that<br> kids get better stuff cheaper.<br> Education, rehabilitation,<br> prevention--<br> that's not significant<br> to these reporters.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - They want to see people in prison.<br> They want to see the gory aspect<br> of the drug problem.<br> Thank you so much for sharing<br> your point of view.<br> - I look forward to working<br> with you in the future.<br> - Well, call me.<br> I have a good bill<br> on treatment-on-demand.<br> I could use your help.<br> - Wonderful. Look forward to it.<br> Thanks, Senator.<br> - Okay. Great.<br> If a judge or a politician is willing<br> to put a reefer in their mouth,<br> - I'll do a story on it.<br> - Right.<br> - Stand up and be independent.<br> - Right.<br> I don't care who's president.

I'm uncomfortable<br> in this crowd."<br> "I don't know what the fuck<br> I'm doing either."<br> "l know you're afraid,<br> and that's okay, you know, because--"<br> Hello? Fucking... exactly.<br> We act like we have all the answers<br> and we're totally invincible...<br> like our parents seem<br> and their parents before them.<br> I'm sorry I have to be the one<br> to say this, but it's fucking bullshit.<br> - For instance?<br> - I know you jack off<br> to Caroline every night,<br> instead of Vanessa,<br> who you're supposed to be in love with.<br> Don't even get me started<br> on that convention.<br> Because what is that convention?<br> We're this random collection<br> of self interests,<br> and all of a sudden we decide...<br> that we're gonna walk two-by-two<br> down the fucking aisle to Noah's Ark?<br> Actually, for your information,<br> when I jerk off,<br> I'm not just thinking about Caroline,<br> I'm thinking about you with Caroline.<br> - So, how about that?<br> - Baby--<br> That is what<br> I'm talking about-- sarcasm.<br> Always fucking sarcasm.<br> You're afraid, and you think<br> that if you admit that,<br> people will think<br> that you are weak...<br> or they won't like you...<br> or whatever it is<br> you think will happen, but--<br> Can you shut up for one second<br> and listen to yourself?<br> Wh-What?<br> Because you are so fucking right.<br> - I'm so fucking high.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Okay, wait.<br> Why don't we...<br> change this thing,<br> this social pattern?<br> Why don't we be different?<br> - Yeah.<br> - But then why are you<br> even talking about it?<br> But we're making it,<br> like, from now on.<br> You're like,<br> "Why don't we do something?"<br> - Why don't you do something?<br> - That's what I'm saying, Seth.<br> - You do it yourself--<br> - I'm saying if you knew it,<br> you wouldn't even say it.<br> Vanessa, I'm serious, I feel fucked up.<br> It's a social pattern, you know?<br> Spence, baby, are you all right?<br> He's fucking blue.<br> He isn't breathing.<br> Oh, my God, Fucked-up Bowman's<br> fucked up.<br> - Wait--<br> - What the fuck do we do?<br> - Uh-- Oh, God--<br> - Fuck !<br> - Somebody call a doctor !<br> - Wait, your dad's a doctor.

Move !<br> Okay, nobody has anything<br> on them, right?<br> Fuck !<br> We know that you killed<br> our chief of intelligence.<br> We also know that you...<br> killed police chiefs<br> in Tijuana and Mexico City.<br> A question.<br> Why do you resist?<br> My father has money.<br> That is not the correct answer.<br> We also found out...<br> that you hunted down<br> a neighbor of General Salazar.<br> A poor peasant.<br> Your people killed<br> his granddaughter.<br> That was a stupid thing to do.<br> - You fucked up.<br> I'm on the board<br> of my son's school.<br> I have fund-raisers<br> for adult literacy at my own home.<br> I think I have a right to know if<br> my husband is a legitimate businessman.<br> Of course he is.<br> I've known Carl for 20 years.<br> He doesn't even jaywalk.<br> Carl is a very important member of this<br> community, and when we get through...<br> suing the police and<br> the district attorney and the D.E.A.,<br> they're gonna be renaming<br> the public parks after your husband.<br> Carl is very, very good<br> at his business.<br> Which is smuggling illegal drugs<br> into this country.<br> - They're whispering.<br> They're whispering.<br> - I know.<br> - Can't hear it.<br> - I know. The fucking bug's<br> too far away from the room.<br> It's halfway to the kitchen.<br> We're not gonna get shit.<br> They're saying something.<br> Sounds like they're conspiring<br> to conspire.<br> I can feel the lies vibrating<br> from their home.<br> I don't think<br> she's in on it, man.<br> Come on, I dream about this.<br> I have actual dreams about this.<br> About busting the top people,<br> the rich people.<br> - White people. Hey.<br> - White people. I know, I know.<br> I don't think she's in on it, man.<br> She knows Arnie Metzger.<br> So does half of San Diego.<br> - You want to bet?<br> - Get in your pocket.<br> - I got--<br> - I love it. I love it when you do this.<br> - How much you want to bet? How much?<br> - I got-- I got 12 bucks.<br> - Okay, give me ten. We'll make it even.<br> - Okay.<br> - Beautiful.<br> - Wait a minute. What?<br> - How old are you?<br> - Sixteen.<br> Live with your parents?<br> Yes.<br> Parents still together?<br> Yes.<br> - Do you work?<br> - I volunteer.<br> I read to blind people,<br> one day a week for two hours.<br> In school?<br> Yes.<br> Private?<br> Yeah.<br> How are your grades?<br> - I'm third in my class.<br> - What does that mean?<br> - I get A's, all A's.<br> - You do?<br> What else do you do?<br> I'm a National Merit Finalist.<br> I'm on the Hi-Q and the Math Team.<br> I'm in the Spanish Club.<br> I'm a thespian.<br> I'm vice president of my class.<br> I'm on the volleyball team.<br> You want to tell me<br> what you're doing here, Caroline?<br> Carol.<br> Oh, sweetie.<br> You okay?<br> It's okay.<br> Caroline, how well did you know<br> this boy that overdosed?<br> He didn't hang around us.<br> He was like one<br> of those hippie kids.<br> I'm not part of that group.<br> How well did you know this boy Seth,<br> the one that was driving?<br> He's a friend.<br> He's also the only one that was doing<br> anything about the situation.<br> He definitely had<br> a few beers, but...<br> it's not like<br> he wanted to drive.<br> We just didn't know<br> what else to do.<br> It wasn't my pot.<br> Okay, we understand, honey.<br> We've got to talk.<br> Alone.<br> - I think she's lying.<br> - Me too.<br> So let's ground her,<br> clip her wings:<br> school, scheduled activities<br> till further notice.<br> Robert, honey, Caroline<br> clearly used very bad judgment,<br> but don't you think spending a night<br> in jail is punishment enough?<br> I mean, we've all<br> had our moments.<br> - Lord knows, I tried<br> every drug there was--<br> - I don't want to hear about that.<br> You experimented<br> when you were in college.<br> Shall we take the quotes off<br> experiment and call it what it was?<br> - This is different.<br> - Why?<br> - She's 16 years old !<br> - I think she needs to find out<br> for herself, on her own.<br> - We have to allow her room<br> to figure out--<br> - You want to give her room?<br> So she can O.D.<br> like that other kid?<br> I am not sending out the message that<br> our family will accept this behavior...<br> because we do not.<br> - Correct?<br> - Of course, but we don't want<br> to push her away.<br> She has to know that we understand<br> what she's exposed to.<br> How long have you known<br> about this?<br> How long have you known?<br> Six months.<br> My technique is more profound<br> than yours, Javier.<br> Much more profound.<br> When he loves me like a father,<br> he will never tell anyone<br> he was here.<br> He will give me<br> the names of his superiors.<br> Then we get them<br> and they too will give us names.<br> And eventually somebody<br> will get us to Juan Obregn.<br> And on that day,<br> the Tijuana cartel will fall.<br> What a disgrace.<br> What a disgrace, Francisco Flores.<br> It's all right. Salazar is here.<br> You're among friends now.<br> This shameful treatment<br> will stop immediately.<br> Guard!<br> Yes, General.<br> Are you responsible for this?<br> - We are not savages!<br> - Yes, General.<br> - Has he eaten?<br> - I don't know, sir.<br> - Go get him some clothes.<br> - Yes, General.<br> Your Honor, this is a man who heads<br> a large criminal organization...<br> with international contacts<br> we can only begin to understand.<br> Our case against him is very strong.<br> He is not a flight risk.<br> His flight is assured.<br> The people ask that Your Honor<br> deny bail. Thank you.<br> My client is no more<br> a flight risk...<br> than Your Honor<br> or the able prosecutor.<br> He's a pillar<br> of his community;<br> a family man with a wife and child<br> living in La Jolla,<br> the communitywhere he has made<br> his home for the past 20 years.<br> As our defense<br> will quickly show,<br> my client is guilty<br> of nothing more...<br> than being the handy target<br> of an admitted criminal.<br> Therefore, we ask that you release<br> Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.<br> I'm going to deny bail.<br> I appreciate you coming in<br> so early this morning.<br> Judge Wakefield,<br> it's an honor to handle it.<br> She's a minor. It probably would have<br> expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.<br> Nevertheless, this is asensitive issue<br> for me. I'm sure you can understand.<br> Like I said, open container,<br> P.I., misdemeanor possession.<br> It's easy to make it go away.<br> One thing bothers me: The kid they<br> dropped off had coke and heroin in him.<br> Serious amounts.<br> He's lucky he's alive.<br> So I've got to ask:<br> What's your daughter on?<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> I mean... have you asked her<br> what kind of drugs she's tried?<br> No.<br> I don't know.<br> - Is she in any kind of therapy,<br> professional help?<br> - No, no, no. No way.<br> My daughter is one of<br> the leading students in her school.<br> Well, I hope it stays that way.<br> Yeah, hi, it's Robert.<br> I want you to clean out my schedule<br> for the next three days.<br> Because I'm tired of talking to experts<br> who've never left the beltway.<br> It's time<br> to see the front lines.<br> Carlos Ayala started out<br> in the family connection business--<br> real estate in Tijuana,<br> fishing boats out of Ensenada,<br> hydroponic strawberries.<br> Then he met up with the Obregon brothers<br> ofthe Tijuana cartel.<br> Using regression analysis,<br> we made a study...<br> of the custom lines at the border<br> and calculated the odds of a search.<br> The odds are not high, and we found<br> variables to reduce those odds.<br> So, you pay off<br> customs officials?<br> Well, you know, in Mexico...<br> law enforcement is<br> an entrepreneurial activity.<br> Not so much in the States.<br> Anyway, we, uh--<br> We hire drivers with nothing to lose and<br> throw a lot of product at the problem.<br> Some get stopped. Enough get through.<br> It's not difficult.<br> Look, boys, this has worked for years.<br> It's gonna continue to work for years.<br> NAFTA makes things even<br> more difficult for you because<br> the border's disappearing.<br> Do you realize in the next<br> year or two at the outside<br> Mexican trucking companies...<br> are gonna be able to go from the States<br> to Mexico and back again...<br> with the same freedom<br> as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx?<br> - It's gonna be a free-for-all.<br> - What, are we on Larry King<br> or something?<br> Shit.<br> Tell us something<br> we don't know, Eddie.<br> You guys remind me of those Japanese<br> soldiers left on deserted islands...<br> who think World War II<br> is still going on.<br> Let me be the first to tell you,<br> your government surrendered<br> this war a long time ago.<br> I don't think all this attitude<br> is gonna help in front of a jury.<br> - It's really a bad attitude.<br> - Very bad. Very bad.<br> Look, Ed, there's only one problem<br> with all this math. You're in here.<br> Well, I got greedy, didn't I?<br> - Yes, you did.<br> - Yeah.<br> Decided to bring a little in on my own<br> and somebody tipped you off.<br> Carl never would have<br> been so stupid.<br> Well, Carl hired you.<br> That was a mistake.<br> Carl and I have been friends<br> since we were little kids.<br> He was loyal.<br> Javi.<br> A group of us are going to a party.<br> Who?<br> Esteban, Guzmn, Toms,<br> all of them.<br> Your new buddies.<br> Yes.<br> - Let's go.<br> - No.<br> - It'll be fun.<br> - Another day.<br> At my house I have<br> some B&W speakers.<br> A while ago I bought a CD burner.<br> I make CDs with the music I want.<br> Just like I bought them in a store.<br> You and I have a lot in common.<br> Not everything, but a lot.<br> We both studied on the other side<br> with the gringos.<br> Your father is an engineer, right?<br> My father-- may he rest in peace--<br> was also an engineer.<br> I've been into stereos<br> since I was very young.<br> Most people don't care...<br> but for me it's very important.<br> They say in Latin:<br> In vino veritas.<br> Wine brings out the truth.<br> Use this to write down...<br> the addresses of those bastards<br> who killed my captains.<br> And not where they were last week,<br> but where they are now.<br> Where they are this minute.<br> And better yet,<br> where they are going to be tomorrow.<br> You know where they are going<br> to be tomorrow, right?<br> Reported by the government<br> news agency, Notimex (NTX) :<br> "Yesterday, forces of the Mexican Army,<br> acting on an anonymmous tip...<br> joined with police to arrest members<br> of the Obregn brothers drug cartel.<br> Head of the Federal Drug Forces, Gen.<br> Arturo Salazar, said in Mexico City...<br> that the sweep was a crippling blow<br> to the Obregn brothers...<br> who reportedly dominate<br> the narcotics trade...<br> in the city of Tijuana<br> and the rest of Baja California state.<br> General Salazar wen t on to say that<br> the au thorities were working overtime...<br> to confirm that Porfirio Madrigal,<br> head of the rival Jurez cartel...<br> died last week during<br> a plastic surgery procedure."<br> Here it is, here it is.<br> Get out, asshole.<br> - Are you going to kill me?<br> - No.<br> No, the Obregns<br> will do that for us.<br> The port of San Ysidro, California:<br> - In the last six months,<br> a threefold increase?<br> - Increase in narcotics seizures.<br> Would that mean, pro rata, three times<br> as much drugs is getting in?<br> That's a scary way to figure it,<br> but I believe that's true.<br> In my heart, I'd love to say<br> that we were getting 60 or 70%.<br> In the reality, we're more like 40 or<br> And it's all big-dollar issues now.<br> That's the reason you're seeing<br> a lot of these murders taking place.<br> It's one organization<br> fighting another organization.<br> When things are good,<br> people don't kill each other.<br> When things are bad,<br> when they're losing dope,<br> when they're losing drivers<br> and guys are going to jail,<br> people start killing each other.<br> - How's David?<br> - "How's David?"<br> - Oh, he's terrific, Carl. Terrific.<br> - Oh, Helena--<br> He watched his father<br> being dragged away by federal agents.<br> - He's just doing fine.<br> - Okay.<br> I can't even begin<br> to tell him where you are...<br> and when you're coming home,<br> if you're ever coming home.<br> Helena... we're gonna get through this.<br> I promise.<br> - I'll make it up to you.<br> - Do you have any idea<br> what's going on out here?<br> Huh? Our credit cards are maxed.<br> The people in the bank--<br> you should see the way they<br> look at me when I walk in.<br> I have a letter<br> from the government telling me...<br> anything I sell from the house will be<br> taken against an income tax lien.<br> Our fucking friends--<br> Nobody will help us.<br> Nobody will take us in.<br> Nobody wants anything<br> to do with us, Carl.<br> So, you just tell me<br> how you're gonna make it up to me.<br> Helena--<br> Just tell me what to do.<br> I'm not bringing a child into the life<br> that I was brought up into.<br> I won't do it, Carl.<br> I want our life back.<br> Yeah, we're smarter.<br> We know the difference.<br> Hello. Ding, ding, ding.<br> We have a winner.<br> - Hi, folks.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi. Room 310, please.<br> - Okay, I need to see some<br> I.D.s, please, and $28.<br> - Okay.<br> Man, I love this place.<br> I wish we could<br> just stay here.<br> Just be here forever<br> and ever and...<br> make a little home here.<br> I want to, uh...<br> I want to have sex and then do a hit<br> right as we're both coming.<br> Okay.<br> The first time I got laid<br> was on a beach just like that.<br> - You got a what on a beach?<br> - Got laid, man.<br> Lost my virginity,<br> was a sophomore in high school.<br> - That's cool.<br> - Yeah, it was sweet.<br> Did he treat you good?<br> - Who's this guy?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I never seen him before.<br> - He's going right for the kid.<br> David !<br> David, come back here !<br> - Mom, Mom.<br> - Please, put down my son.<br> Shouldn't let<br> your kid wander off with strangers.<br> Karen, if he tries to move<br> with that kid, you break cover.<br> Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes<br> a lot of money. Snapping this<br> kid's neck wouldn't cover it.<br> You better come up with it in a hurry<br> or your kid is gonna disappear,<br> and he won't turn up<br> until the evening news.<br> You get only one warning.<br> First payment is $3 million.<br> -Javier.<br> - Yes?<br> What's up, Ana?<br> Manolo never came home last night.<br> Come in, come in. Sit down.<br> I don't know where he is.<br> He wasn't with you last night?<br> No.<br> I'm worried.<br> Don't worry too much.<br> It makes you ugly.<br> Do you want a coffee?<br> Coffee with sugar?<br> - No.<br> - No?<br> Look, Javier.<br> I was going through his clothes<br> the other day.<br> Look what I found.<br> What is it?<br> - What were you doing?<br> - I was with friends from work.<br> Was Salazar there?<br> No.<br> The general is going<br> to Mexico City next week...<br> and I'm not going<br> to get left behind.<br> Javier Rodriguez.<br> The word is you're not<br> that happy in your work.<br> Maybe we can help.<br> -John, how are you?<br> Bob Wakefield, pleasure.<br> -Judge, welcome.<br> - Good to see you. How are you?<br> - Long time, no see.<br> EPIC is very unique.<br> It's a facility that has over 15<br> different agencies--state and local--<br> that participate<br> in gathering intelligence...<br> and making sure<br> that information gets out...<br> to people in the field that need it<br> to stop drug trafficking.<br> From here, we have the ability<br> to track vessels, airplanes, boats,<br> anything that carries drugs.<br> When the information comes in,<br> we're able to check<br> with different databases...<br> to see if it's<br> in the system or not.<br> And would most of that energy<br> be focused on the two cartels?<br> The Juarez, the Obregon brothers--<br> Are those the two that would be<br> most important?<br> Those are the two<br> clearest threats right now.<br> They are the dominant force<br> in trafficking,<br> both on the Mexican side<br> and in the U.S.<br> How are the cartels achieving...<br> the level of intelligence and<br> sophistication that they're showing?<br> - Craig, why don't you answer that?<br> - An unlimited budget.<br> So, you're saying, actually,<br> that even a country of our size...<br> and the budget that we throw<br> towards this issue,<br> - they can compete at the same level?<br> - No, they're way beyond us.<br> - "Way beyond"?<br> - Our budgetary process<br> makes us pale in comparison.<br> That house you're looking at over there<br> used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.<br> His nickname was Scorpion.<br> I'll let you figure out<br> what that means.<br> Wasn't that the guy<br> who died during plastic surgery?<br> Best of our information, yes.<br> Who do you interact with<br> on that side?<br> Nobody.<br> Well, who has my job in Mexico?<br> Your position doesn't exist<br> over there yet.<br> I want<br> everyone thinking out of the box...<br> for the next few minutes.<br> What are we doing about Mexico?<br> - Come on, guys, out of the box.<br> - Unlimited funds?<br> Unlimited.<br> From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need<br> a vetted task force and matching funds.<br> And cut the red tape on getting them<br> equipment and training.<br> Come on, guys,<br> I want to hear from everyone:<br> F.B.I., customs, treatment.<br> - Is there anybody from treatment<br> on this plane?<br> - No, Judge.<br> Then, I want to know why there isn't<br> anybody from treatment on this plane.<br> Yes, sir.<br> We need to take down one of<br> these cartels--Juarez or Tijuana--<br> not because they're a symbol, but--<br> Hell, they are a symbol.<br> But because we need to send a message.<br> When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler<br> as his legal defense,<br> I send Ben Williams<br> down to San Diego as a prosecutor.<br> Why? Because it's a symbol.<br> It's a symbol that<br> we are sending the best.<br> It's a message that we're<br> going after their top guys.<br> So...<br> right now...<br> on this flight only...<br> the dam is open...<br> for new ideas.<br> On a clear day,<br> you can see Mexico City.<br> I have this place swept twice a day,<br> so just feel free to talk.<br> I learned that back<br> in Miami in '85.<br> U.S. shut down<br> the entire Caribbean.<br> - It's a big game of whack-a-mole.<br> You knock it down in Miami--<br> - Arnie, I need money.<br> Somebody-- I think it was the Obregons--<br> threatened David.<br> They want a first payment<br> of $3 million.<br> Oh, Helena.<br> I'd give it to you myself, but I-I-I<br> just don't have that kind of money.<br> Please. Does anyone owe us money?<br> Yes, there are people that do owe<br> you money, but nobody's gonna pay.<br> Carl's got too much heat on him.<br> What about our other businesses,<br> our legitimate businesses?<br> - Don't we own a construction--<br> - Laundromats wash the money.<br> Just tell me something<br> positive, Arnie.<br> Give me some good news,<br> for Christ's sake.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I just keep wondering what's<br> gonna happen if he doesn't get out.<br> Just never been<br> on my own before.<br> Always had someone. Always.<br> I remember the first time<br> that I saw you--<br> little Helen Watts<br> from the wrong side of somewhere.<br> Somehow I knew even then that your<br> survival skills were pretty well honed.<br> Glad you think so, Arnie.<br> I just keep picturing a debt-ridden,<br> whose ex-husband<br> is being compared to Pablo Escobar.<br> I don't know anyone who wants<br> to be with someone like that.<br> Do you?<br> Do you?<br> You two don't like me, do you?<br> Miss, with all due respect,<br> we don't have an opinion.<br> Maybe it's because<br> I'm going to have...<br> the nicest home you've ever seen<br> in your miserable lives.<br> The old man actually<br> kept his promise.<br> The general is a man of his word.<br> They will say anything<br> to get what they want...<br> and then it's always<br> tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.<br> Occupational hazard, I guess.<br> - The bags?<br> -My love, it's beautiful! How beautiful!<br> How are you feeling? Good?<br> How handsome you are.<br> Listen...<br> the Scorpion is alive.<br> Get in.<br> Porfirio Madrigal<br> isn't dead after all!<br> That means that Salazar is working<br> for the Jurez cartel.<br> I can't believe<br> this doesn't matter to you.<br> This is nothing new, Manolo.<br> That's why Salazar is so interested<br> in cleaning up Tijuana.<br> And he has plans for Juan Obregn,<br> the bastard.<br> That's right.<br> You know how much money<br> he would pay for this information?<br> - How much?<br> - A fuckload of money, partner.<br> - What's up, man?<br> - Take off your glasses.<br> Take off your glasses<br> so I can see your eyes.<br> We're going to keep<br> our mouths shut.<br> Okay.<br> I think we<br> may have found our Mexican drug czar.<br> General Salazar.<br> Be nice to have somebody<br> to workwith down there.<br> Does this mean you're<br> gonna be gone more?<br> Possibly, yeah.<br> You might want to pencil in<br> a little face time with your daughter.<br> - Barbara--<br> - Because I'm at the edge<br> of my capabilities, Robert.<br> I think it's important<br> we maintain a unified front.<br> If you start in<br> on the war metaphors,<br> I'm gonna drive this car<br> into a telephone pole.<br> - I am as worried as you are.<br> - Oh, I don't think so.<br> "Leave me alone.<br> Give me some money."<br> That's what I get<br> from our daughter.<br> She has a way of shutting me out<br> that seems very familiar.<br> Well, she has a way of self-medicating<br> that I'm sure is very familiar to you.<br> I'm not the one who has<br> to have three scotches...<br> just to walk in the house<br> and say hello.<br> I have one drink before dinner<br> to take the edge off. It's different.<br> -Oh, is it?<br> -Otherwise, I would be dying of boredom.<br> Why don't you go in and tell<br> your daughter how bored you are?<br> Caroline, open this door immediately.<br> Who is it?<br> I'm going to the bathroom.<br> - Open the goddamn door !<br> - One minute.<br> Excuse me.<br> I have to go to bed.<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> You are not going anywhere, young lady.<br> You stay right there.<br> Where are they?<br> Where the hell are the drugs?<br> Where are they?<br> Fuck you.<br> Fuck you.<br> I wasn't doing anything.<br> You're like the Gestapo.<br> Fuck me. Fuck me.<br> Well, fuck you !<br> - Javier, good to see you.<br> - How you doing, partner?<br> Did you take the precautions<br> we discussed about being followed?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - Will you move to the middle, please?<br> - You're not carrying a weapon?<br> - No.<br> - Of course not.<br> - Where are you taking me?<br> - Somewhere safe.<br> - Where?<br> A place we have that we know<br> is protected. He's good. Let's go.<br> - No, no. No, no, no.<br> - Don't worry. It's really safe.<br> No, no, no, no, no.<br> This is safe. This is safe.<br> Come on, Javier, close the door.<br> Everything is cool, all right?<br> - This is safe.<br> - Come on.<br> Allright.<br> Where would you like to go?<br> - Huh?<br> - Where do you want to go, Javier?<br> I believe it's<br> important that we work together.<br> Mexico and the United States.<br> One hand washing the other.<br> We agree.<br> So, maybe you can tell me<br> about your informants in our operations.<br> We thought that maybe you'd have<br> that kind of information for us.<br> This is a very different<br> proposition, my friend.<br> We pay for that kind<br> of information.<br> Is that what<br> you're talking about, Javier?<br> Getting paid?<br> You like baseball?<br> We need lights for the parks<br> so kids can play at night.<br> So it's safe.<br> So they can play baseball.<br> So they no become--<br> Everybody like baseball.<br> Everybody likes parks.<br> Listen.<br> I believe it's important that<br> the United State take an interest...<br> in Tijuana now.<br> That's what I'm talking about,<br> my friends.<br> Accountnumber...<br> A cash advance.<br> How much can I get?<br> That's it?<br> You ever try the patch, man?<br> - The what?<br> - The patch.<br> - That shit doesn't work, bro.<br> - It worked for my cousin.<br> - No shit?<br> - Yeah.<br> He had to wear five or six<br> at a time, but it worked.<br> - So, how's he doing now?<br> - Oh, he's dead.<br> - He's dead?<br> - It wasn't from the patch, man.<br> - Okay, she's coming out.<br> - On it.<br> - What did he die from?<br> - His wife shot him.<br> She's leaving her property.<br> Where the hell is she going?<br> Maybe her neighbors.<br> No, I don't think the neighbors<br> are fucking with her too much<br> right about now.<br> What does she have<br> in her hand there?<br> She seems to be headed for the van.<br> Oh, shit.<br> - What-- Wh-What do we do?<br> - I-l don't know. What do we do?<br> - What do you think she wants, man?<br> - She's your girlfriend.<br> You think she'll invite you<br> to her baby shower?<br> -Just say hello. Work it.<br> - All right, all right, all right.<br> She's waiting outside the van.<br> - Hello?<br> - Would you like some lemonade?<br> - I was just making some.<br> - You want some lemonade?<br> Sure.<br> I knowt his is a difficult situation,<br> and you're only doing your jobs.<br> I don't wish you guys<br> any ill will or anything like that.<br> But I have a favor to ask you.<br> You're asking us for a favor?<br> Some man threatened my child.<br> These charges have created<br> so much attention,<br> it seems to be bringing<br> all the nutjobs out of the nutjar.<br> Would you keep an eye out<br> for anything out of the ordinary?<br> - Sure.<br> - Yeah, of course we will.<br> - I'd really appreciate it.<br> - Sure.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Thank you for the lemonade.<br> You're welcome.<br> I'm gonna get this analyzed<br> right away, bro.<br> So, it was my birthday...<br> and my ex-wife<br> was getting remarried...<br> and I was in some church basement<br> telling a bunch of strangers...<br> it was a good day because...<br> I didn't have to eat<br> out of a Dumpster.<br> That was enough to send me<br> out on a pretty big one.<br> I've been thinking a lot<br> about the first step--<br> that I came to believe<br> I was powerless over alcohol...<br> and that my life<br> had become unmanageable.<br> My disease tells me<br> that I don't have a disease,<br> that it's my birthday<br> and I can have one little beer,<br> one little line,<br> a little Valium.<br> Six months later, I wake up<br> in a sober-living house in Philly.<br> I'm from Dallas, people.<br> It's a disease,<br> an allergy of the body,<br> an obsession of the mind.<br> So, my name is Marty,<br> and today I'm a grateful,<br> recovering alcoholic.<br> And it's a good day because I<br> didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.<br> Thanks.<br> Hi.<br> I'm Caroline.<br> I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic.<br> I mean...<br> I don't really like to drink.<br> For someone my age, it's a lot easier<br> to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.<br> I guess I'm angry.<br> I mean, I think I'm really angry<br> about a lot of stuff.<br> I'm just... not sure what.<br> Listen to me.<br> I built our house...<br> and I'm not gonna lose it.<br> My business--<br> that would take a lot<br> of private study.<br> I suggest...<br> you look into the Coronel.<br> - The painting?<br> - Into selling it.<br> If you can stomach it,<br> you should look into it.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Dear Judge,<br> I recruited the best men<br> in Mexico for my task force.<br> I make the selection, putting them<br> under a rigorous screening process.<br> And not only physically,<br> but also psychologically.<br> Judge, I'm sorry for boxes<br> and the paintings and things,<br> but I have been too busy<br> to completely settle in here.<br> I know you've made very good progress<br> with the Tijuana cartel.<br> - Congratulations, General.<br> - Muchas gracias.<br> I am confident<br> that before the end of the year,<br> Juan Obregon is gonna<br> be taken into custody.<br> But you must understand that it's<br> going to be a very difficult task...<br> because of the corruption<br> in the police force.<br> Hopefully, the exchange<br> of training methods and information...<br> between our two countries will help.<br> I hope so.<br> On another note, General,<br> we were talking about supply.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - What about demand?<br> What are your policies<br> towards treatment of addiction?<br> "Treatment of addiction."<br> Addicts treat themselves.<br> They overdose, and then there's<br> one less to worry about.<br> What I want you to do right now<br> is write down five triggers...<br> that could lead<br> to your relapse,<br> that could jeopardize<br> your recovery.<br> Five triggers.<br> Your parents, something they could say.<br> Anything that's a trigger for you.<br> It varies from person to person.<br> Some of us<br> have already discussed--<br> Linda, we talked about it<br> the other day.<br> I know you have trouble<br> with your sister,<br> how she's always<br> kind of outshining you.<br> Hey, sugarfoot,<br> how do you like your new home?<br> - You got to be kidding me.<br> This is not what my lawyers negotiated.<br> Please. Fuck your lawyers.<br> You're not getting<br> any goddamn cappuccino or--<br> - Biscotti.<br> - Yeah, you ain't getting<br> none of that shit either.<br> - Pick a bed.<br> - Stay off the phone, Eddie.<br> No long-distance calls, all right?<br> - Use 1-800-CRIMINAL if you do.<br> Mr. Ayala first came<br> to see me in January.<br> That would have been 1987.<br> He wanted to rent warehouse space<br> along the harbor.<br> I didn't ask too many questions.<br> I am a businessman also.<br> I was the company's secretary<br> from 1991 to 1994.<br> I supposedly worked for all<br> six companies, but they weren't--<br> I mean, it was just an empty office<br> with a desk and a telephone.<br> I never sold anything<br> the whole time I was there.<br> Sometimes people came in,<br> and they got paid.<br> I-I don't really know<br> what they did.<br> - Didn't Mr. Ayala<br> say where the money came from?<br> - No.<br> -Did you ask where the money came from?<br> -No.<br> Where do you think it came from?<br> - Objection. Speculation.<br> - Sustained.<br> I'll rephrase, Your Honor.<br> Did you feel like you were engaged<br> in a legitimate enterprise?<br> No, not really.<br> Thank you.<br> You were followed by the police,<br> but they won't be able<br> to hear us over the children.<br> I want to use a bomb.<br> Are you kidding?<br> Can't you just shoot him<br> or something?<br> I don't really like guns.<br> You shoot somebody in the head<br> two, three times...<br> and some pinche doctor<br> is trying to keep him alive.<br> When are you gonna do it?<br> I don't know.<br> Eduardo Ruiz is the only<br> real witness against Carl.<br> Security will be very tight.<br> - I may not be able to get to him.<br> - You'll be able to get to him.<br> If they can get to<br> the pope and the president,<br> you can certainly get to him.<br> Careful. You're starting to sound<br> like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.<br> Nobody saw her leave?<br> Hmm.<br> No, I understand.<br> Okay.<br> I gotta go.<br> I've got to go home.<br> Did you want me to resch--<br> Fine.<br> What's going on? You seem nervous.<br> - Because of Manolo.<br> I'm afraid he'll do something foolish<br> and it's going to get him killed.<br> Why?<br> He says he's going<br> to sell information to the DEA.<br> They're going to pay him<br> a lot of money.<br> What could he tell the DEA?<br> You know...<br> about Salazar and Madrigal.<br> Javier.<br> Where is he right now?<br> I don't know.<br> He took his passport and left.<br> Give me a kiss.<br> Don't tell him that I told you.<br> No.<br> What you want? Pot? Rock?<br> Hey, what you want?<br> - Fuck !<br> What the fuck do you want?<br> Yeah.<br> It has come to our attention that<br> Your Honor, while in private practice,<br> previously represented<br> the town of Seal Beach...<br> in their stop-work suit against<br> the police department of Seal Beach.<br> We believe this disqualifies you<br> from hearing this case,<br> and we, therefore, move for a temporary<br> suspension until it's investigated.<br> Mr. Adler, this is<br> a most unusual motion.<br> Nonetheless, Your Honor,<br> we feel our client deserves<br> every fairness afforded under the law.<br> I hope this is not in anyway designed<br> to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.<br> We will recess until 9:00 a.m.<br> on Monday morning,<br> and I will see counsel<br> in my chambers.<br> They are coming this way.<br> All of them are there.<br> They are passing me now.<br> Boy, there's a lot of them.<br> Listen, would you mind if we<br> walked back to the hotel today?<br> - Walk back?<br> - Yeah.<br> They're not getting into the car.<br> What are they doing?<br> They're arguing or something.<br> It's two blocks.<br> I could use the fresh air.<br> I've been stuck in that piece of shit<br> hotel room for two weeks.<br> I don't give a fuck.<br> Let's just stop standing around.<br> - I want to walk 'cause I want to walk,<br> not 'cause he wants to walk.<br> - Let's walk.<br> I like that.<br> Okay, we'll walk.<br> They're going past me.<br> I-I-I do not know. I think<br> they're going back to the courthouse.<br> This could be the last chance<br> to do this ! Get out of the car<br> and shoot him in the head !<br> You're a fucking big man?<br> I'm a real fucking man. I don't fucking<br> deal drugs to little fucking kids, you--<br> Fucking rat.<br> - You think you're a badass?<br> - I am a badass !<br> Move, move ! Get down !<br> - Go, go, go!<br> We need an ambulance.<br> - Go, go, go.<br> Ray. Ray ! Ray !<br> Wait a minute, Ray !<br> Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.<br> What's up, Manolo?<br> Looks like you're waiting<br> for someone.<br> I'm just looking for the waitress.<br> I'm ready to order.<br> Do you want anything?<br> A fucking salad?<br> Something to drink?<br> No, no. Calm down, calm down.<br> What are you gonna have, Manolito?<br> A steak.<br> Well, if you like steak...<br> we know a much better place.<br> You come with us.<br> Javier had nothing to do with this.<br> It was all my idea.<br> Punish me, not him.<br> Do me a favor.<br> Don't tell Ana I died like this.<br> Tell her it was something else.<br> Something official.<br> Tell her I died<br> doing something worthy.<br> Forgive me, Javi.<br> Put some muscle into it.<br> You too, Manolo.<br> You're done.<br> - Get out of there.<br> - Don't you hear?<br> Javier, put the shovel down.<br> Get out. Let's go.<br> I told you it wasn't his fault.<br> Shut up.<br> Turn around.<br> Let's go, Javier. It's over.<br> Don't be alarmed, Javier.<br> The old man works like this.<br> We had to go<br> through the same thing.<br> We had to do this<br> to be sure we could trust you.<br> Now we see that we can.<br> We are family now.<br> Sorry about the other night.<br> Me too.<br> Thank you for coming down here, though I<br> suspect it has been a pointless journey.<br> - Why would you say that?<br> - Bueno, pues, I hear these stories.<br> Your husband in jail,<br> his business in chaos,<br> various people fighting<br> over the scraps.<br> My husband was a victim of an informer<br> in your organization, not in ours.<br> That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.<br> Your route has been compromised.<br> Perhaps it is time for me to deal<br> with other distributors in California.<br> - I don't think you're gonna do that.<br> - You don't?<br> - No.<br> My husband was working on something<br> he called the Project for the Children.<br> - Are you aware of this?<br> - I don't know.<br> Perhaps I remember something.<br> If you want to smuggle narcotics<br> in Senor Espastico Jacobo,<br> that is nothing new, Senora.<br> No, not in.<br> The doll is cocaine.<br> High impact,<br> pressure-molded cocaine.<br> It's odorless,<br> undetectable by the dogs.<br> - Undetectable by anyone.<br> I don't believe you, senora.<br> I'm six months pregnant.<br> I won't do it.<br> - Then we don't have a deal.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> We don't have a deal.<br> Sorry to waste your time,<br> Mr. Obregon.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, okay.<br> - That's good coke.<br> - It should be. It's yours.<br> I want our debt forgiven,<br> I want to be the exclusive<br> distributor of Obregon brothers'<br> cocaine in the United States,<br> and I want the principal witness against<br> my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.<br> Have you told the complete truth<br> during this interview?<br> Yes.<br> - Alex?<br> - Solid.<br> - That's good shit, Javier.<br> - You know, Javier,<br> they dump those cell phones<br> every 24 hours.<br> Yes, but I have<br> a contact at MexTel...<br> who can get me<br> his new E.S.N. in 12 hours.<br> That's good to know.<br> So, now that you have<br> what you want,<br> let's talk about how<br> I get what I want.<br> Oh, you don't have<br> to worry about that.<br> You're not gonna have<br> any problems there.<br> Yeah, but first let's talk<br> about what precautions you're<br> taking to protect yourself.<br> You worry about getting me<br> what I want.<br> I'll worry about myself.<br> Oye, Javier,<br> you should feel good about this.<br> I feel like a traitor.<br> Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum,<br> the Obregon brothers' place in Tijuana.<br> - Yeah?<br> - She got stopped at the border.<br> She was clean,<br> and she's back in San Diego now.<br> Okay.<br> - Hello?<br> - Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.<br> - D-Did I wake you? I'm sorry.<br> - No, it's okay.<br> General Salazar has been arrested.<br> It turns out he has been working<br> for Porfirio Madrigal...<br> and the Juarez cartel<br> the entire time.<br> That is why he was trying to push<br> the Obregons out of Tijuana...<br> - so he and Madrigal could move in.<br> - What?<br> I thought Madrigal was dead.<br> I thought that had been verified.<br> Apparently not. It is a shitstorm here,<br> but the D.E.A. supplied the information<br> and was part of the sting.<br> So, maybe we can spin this a little,<br> but I don't know what to tell people.<br> -So, when are you coming back?<br> -I'll try to get there as soon as I can.<br> - Yeah, okay, but--<br> - Robert.<br> Robert? Robert?<br> I gotta call you back.<br> - What--<br> - My Leica's missing.<br> - She got the video camera too.<br> At least we know she's still alive.<br> Where are you going?<br> Pawn shops open in an hour. Ten minutes<br> after that, she'll be at her dealer.<br> If I can find him,<br> I should be able to find her.<br> Although<br> ser and estar both mean "to be,"<br> they have very specific uses.<br> May I help you, sir?<br> Excuse me!<br> Seth has to be excused.<br> He's going on a field trip.<br> I can't believe you brought<br> my daughter to this place.<br> Whoa, whoa. Why don't you just<br> back the fuck up, man?<br> "To this place"?<br> What is that shit?<br> Okay, right now, all over<br> this great nation of ours,<br> are cruising around downtown...<br> asking every black person,<br> "You got any drugs? You know<br> where I can score some drugs?"<br> Think about the effect that has<br> on the psyche of a black person,<br> on their possibilities.<br> I-- God, I guarantee you,<br> you bring 100,000 black people<br> into your neighborhood,<br> and they're asking every white<br> person, "You got any drugs?<br> Know where I can score some?"<br> Within a day, everyone would be<br> selling--your friends, their kids.<br> Here's why: It's an unbeatable market<br> force, man.
