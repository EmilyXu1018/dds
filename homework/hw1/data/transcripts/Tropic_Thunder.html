It's about family,<br> and... you! You can't do what I do.<br> Fresh from his most recent arrest<br> for heroin, glue and crack possession,<br> Portnoy was almost uninsurable.<br> Also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking<br> hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino.<br> I'm so excited, you know what I'm<br> saying, about doing Tropic Thunder.<br> Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby.<br> Drink Booty Sweat.<br> But the real heavyweight on the set<br> is five-time Academy Award winner<br> Kirk Lazarus.<br> Is five-time Academy Award winner<br> Kirk Lazarus.<br> The brilliant Australian<br> known for his bad boy antics off-screen<br> is famous for his total immersion<br> into any role he portrays.<br> Well, being an actor is no different<br> than being a rugby player<br> or a construction worker,<br> save for the fact that my tools<br> are the mechanisms<br> that trigger human emotion.<br> Lazarus underwent a controversial<br> pigmentation alteration procedure<br> in order to play<br> the platoon's African-American<br> sergeant, Lincoln Osiris.<br> Yeah!<br> Trying to hold his own onscreen<br> with Kirk<br> is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman.<br> Once the highest grossing star<br> in the world,<br> lately his Scorcher films<br> have lost their heat.<br> Recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.<br> You have no real family.<br> You're on the wrong side of 40.<br> You're childless and alone.<br> Somebody close to you said,<br> "One more flop and it's over."<br> Somebody said they were close to me?<br> It's been a tough year for Tugg.<br> The disappointing buddy comedy<br> Chitlin' & the Dude<br> was followed by an ill-advised venture<br> into serious dramatic territory.<br> Simple Jack,<br> the story of a mentally impaired<br> farmhand who can talk to animals,<br> was a box office disaster<br> that many critics called,<br> "One of the worst movies of all time."<br> I ain't got a good brain.<br> I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.<br> You make me happy.<br> But now the question is,<br> can Speedman make audiences happy<br> in what's being called<br> the most expensive<br> - war movie never made?<br> - Rick Peck.<br> Wishing Tugg all the best on that one.<br> Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker.<br> You got time for your agent?<br> - Rick?<br> - Hey, buddy,<br> guess who I'm staring at right now.<br> - What?<br> - I'm looking at your ugly mug<br> on the back cover<br> of Vanity Fair magazine,<br> holding a cute, cuddly panda<br> from Cutesville.<br> It is insane, bro. You are a rock star.<br> Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?<br> From Rick.<br> Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.<br> All right,<br> that is a real satellite phone, bro.<br> Do not re-gift.<br> Hey. You see<br> that Access Hollywood piece?<br> Yeah, I did.<br> It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.<br> I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,<br> Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?<br> But right now,<br> you're like that kid on the playground,<br> you know,<br> the one who has lice that none<br> of the other kids want to play with?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - I mean we gotta shave your head<br> and get you back<br> on the monkey bars, right?<br> What?<br> How did the crying scene go?<br> Horrible. Lazarus started crying.<br> Then he starts drooling and dribbling,<br> and it wasn't even in the script...<br> Stop right there!<br> You gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.<br> Who cares how much more talented<br> he may be than you?<br> If he cries, you cry harder, man.<br> Didn't your dog have, like, leukemia<br> or something<br> when you were a kid?<br> I mean, think of that.<br> Boom!

Can I please...<br> No, you can't have<br> any fucking jellybeans.<br> They're mine.<br> You think<br> you're the only one who gets sick<br> when he doesn't have his jellybeans?<br> Boundaries, man. Fuck.<br> Hey. I didn't mean to<br> show you up back there.<br> It's just, I feel like we really need<br> to set the example for the other guys.<br> It's gonna be tough,<br> but I think Damien's gonna get<br> some great shit out of us.<br> Just wish I had<br> a director like this on Jack.<br> On Jack. What? Jack?<br> What you talking about?<br> - Simple Jack.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Simple Jack, yeah.<br> You went all out on that one, huh?<br> You did.<br> Really swung for the fences, huh?<br> Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.<br> Yeah, it was an intense experience,<br> you know.<br> I just did the work.<br> Watched a lot of retarded people.<br> Spent time with them. Observed them.<br> Watched all the retarded stuff they did.<br> Then again,<br> I always found mere observation<br> in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.<br> Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper<br> to mine the true emotional pay dirt.<br> Thus, we can diagram the source<br> of the pain and then live it, you know.<br> Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.<br> You know, there were times<br> when I was doing Jack<br> that I actually felt retarded,<br> - like really retarded.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded,<br> - I rode the bus retarded.<br> - Damn.<br> In a weird way,<br> I had to sort of just free myself up<br> to believe that it was okay<br> to be stupid or dumb.<br> - To be a moron.<br> - Yeah.<br> - To be moronical.<br> - Exactly, to be a moron.<br> - An imbecile.<br> - Yeah.<br> Like the dumbest motherfucker<br> that ever lived.<br> When I was playing the character.<br> - When you was the character.<br> - Yeah, as Jack, definitely.<br> Jack, stupid ass Jack.<br> Trying to come back from that.<br> In a weird way it was almost like<br> I had to sort of fool my mind<br> into believing that it wasn't retarded,<br> and by the end of the whole thing,<br> I was like,<br> "Wait a minute, I flushed so much out,<br> how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?"<br> - It's just like... Right?<br> - Yeah.<br> You was farting in bathtubs<br> and laughing your ass off.<br> Yeah.<br> But Simple Jack thought he was smart,<br> or rather, didn't think he was retarded,<br> so you can't afford to play retarded,<br> being a smart actor.<br> Playing a guy who ain't smart<br> but thinks he is,<br> - that's tricky.<br> - Tricky.<br> It's like working with mercury.<br> It's high science, man. It's an art form.<br> - Yeah.<br> - You an artist.<br> - That's what we do, right? Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hats off for going there,<br> especially knowing how<br> the Academy is about that shit.<br> - About what?<br> - You're serious? You don't know?<br> Everybody knows<br> you never go full retard.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Check it out.<br> Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, looked<br> retarded, act retarded, not retarded.<br> Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.<br> Autistic, sure. Not retarded.<br> Then you got Tom Hanks,<br> Forrest Gump.<br> Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,<br> braces on his legs.<br> But he charmed the pants off Nixon,<br> and he won a Ping-Pong competition.<br> That ain't retarded.<br> And he was a goddamn war hero.<br> You know any retarded war heroes?<br> You went full retard, man.<br> Never go full retard.<br> You don't buy that?<br> Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I Am Sam.<br> Remember? Went full retard?<br> Went home empty-handed.<br> Oh, my God! Holy shit!<br> Good job, turd. You killed the director.<br> No, that's impossible, man.<br> I rigged the whole tree line,<br> and this is here.<br> - He must have missed his mark.<br> - Missed his mark?<br> Yeah, this isn't me.<br> Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard<br> and get back to the hotel.<br> - You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!<br> - We're in a world of hurt!<br> - You're in trouble.<br> - This isn't just on me!<br> - We're in a... We're together on this.<br> - Bullshit.<br> You're just gonna run away.<br> You're gonna leave.<br> What happened to,<br> "No man left behind," okay?<br> Just wait, just wait! Listen!<br> Listen, okay?<br> - I don't wanna hear it.<br> - Let me just be real with you, all right?<br> I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis<br> on Freaky Friday, okay?<br> This shit will fucking ruin me!<br> - Just get off me! You're pathetic.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - Get off me!<br> - You are not going back!<br> - What the fuck?<br> - Now wait a minute.<br> So, what?<br> We're just supposed to keep walking?<br> Try to stay in character.<br> Remember, we're on camera.<br> This thing's too heavy.<br> I want the rubber one<br> that the prop guy gave me.<br> Where's the fucking prop guy?<br> How's it going with that map, chief?<br> - Can I have a look at it?<br> - I got it.<br> Yeah, Damien gave it to me,<br> remember?<br> Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Okay.<br> - I got it.<br> - You got it upside down.<br> Thank you.<br> Letters go one way<br> and the numbers another.<br> Dude, I'm trying to...<br> I got your back, man.<br> - Well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool.<br> - You are?<br> Is your character dyslexic?<br> - No, my character's not dyslexic.<br> - So you a cartographer.<br> I'm tired, I want to go home.<br> Why, so you can get back and make<br> Fatties: Fart 20, or some shit?<br> It's Fatties: Fart Two, there's no... Hey,<br> you wish you had a Fatties franchise.<br> - What?<br> - It's Fatties: Fart Two.<br> - Yeah, you do.<br> - I don't want no Fatties franchise,<br> - I got a diamond toilet.<br> - Your stupid-ass commercials.<br> You're all fucked up, man,<br> you look tired.<br> You look like you bumped your head<br> or something,<br> so I came over to see<br> if you're fucking all right, that's all.<br> - Yeah, why don't you get on point?<br> - I'm on point right here.<br> ...my farts<br> are fucking more beautiful than...<br> You still got that shit upside down.<br> The numbers help, man, the numbers...<br> The letters go across the top<br> and then the numbers.<br> - Want the map?<br> - Yeah, I want the fucking map.<br> Well, you can't have it,<br> 'cause Damien gave it me.<br> You wish you had my farts,<br> my farts are fucking music.<br> All right. That's enough.<br> Everybody's obviously a little bushed<br> from all this humping.<br> So take a chow break. Chow break!<br> But stay alert.<br> Remember, Charlie don't care<br> if you're on break or not.<br> All right, that's lunch. Coming back<br> to the same scene afterwards,<br> "Lost in the goddamn jungle."<br> Captain Simple Jack.<br> Fuck you.<br> I fucking hate movies.<br> This is bullshit.<br> I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.<br> No!

You're beautiful.<br> Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo<br> where Hollywood<br> was split into schisms,<br> some studios backing Blu-ray Disc,<br> others backing HD DVD.<br> People thought it would come down to<br> pixel rate or refresh rate,<br> and they're pretty much the same.<br> What it came down to was<br> a combination of gamers and porn.<br> Now, whichever format porno backs<br> is usually the one<br> that becomes the most successful.<br> But, you know, Sony,<br> every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.<br> You talking to me this whole time?<br> I was talking to whoever<br> was listening to me.<br> Jesus Christ, man!<br> Booty Sweat.<br> Oh, God!<br> It's cold!

It's a cure-all.<br> Man, what you coming out<br> in movies for anyway?<br> Did you need another revenue stream?<br> For your information,<br> my revenue stream<br> currently generates $2 million a year<br> in charitable contributions<br> for my community.<br> - Hot damn.<br> - And why am I in this movie?<br> Maybe I just knew I had to represent,<br> because they had one good part<br> in it for a black man<br> and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.<br> Pump your brakes, kid.<br> That man is a national treasure.<br> I just wanted to throw another shrimp<br> on your barbie.<br> That shit ain't funny.<br> Hey, fellas!

Scum!<br> Were there some re-writes<br> that I missed?<br> Do you want to die?<br> - Do you?<br> - No!<br> Please, don't hurt me!<br> Say that again.<br> Please, don't hurt me.<br> No!

We could do something<br> by getting our asses back to the hotel,<br> which is in the other direction!<br> Ain't right.<br> What would've happened<br> in The Great Escape<br> if Steve McQueen and them dudes<br> had turned tail and ran?<br> Well, that's what that movie was about.<br> They were escaping. They ran away.<br> I'm trying to agree with you.<br> The point is they did something.<br> Then what are we supposed to do, huh?<br> 'Cause he's cleaning a gun<br> with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.<br> I'm just like a little boy,<br> playing with his dick when he's nervous.<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I got an idea.<br> This might be a little crazy.<br> Crazy's better than nothing.<br> Back in '98, I did a low-budget<br> titty comedy for Skinemax.<br> - Sex Camp. Remember it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Anyway, me and the campers<br> from the uncool camp<br> had to break into the rich girl camp.<br> So, what we did,<br> we built a catapult<br> out of logs and underwear,<br> and they shot us over the wall,<br> and we parachuted down.<br> Look,<br> you guys, we already know the plan.<br> Are you fucking kidding me?<br> I'm giving you gold.<br> We do it just like in the book,<br> Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.<br> The book of Tropic Thunder.<br> Yeah, did you guys read the book?<br> The flap, I read the back flap<br> and saw the pictures.<br> Well, it's okay.<br> It's exactly the same as in the script.<br> Cool.<br> You guys all read the script, right?<br> I don't read the script, script reads me.<br> What the hell does that even mean?<br> What you getting at with the books,<br> scripts? Spit that shit out, man!<br> All right. The Wet Offensive.<br> Osiris and Fats go undercover<br> as a diversion.<br> Osiris and Fats go undercover<br> as a diversion.<br> Motown and Brooklyn sneak in<br> via the river.<br> Yeah. But those dudes<br> was trained soldiers.<br> Yeah!<br> And we trained actors, motherfucker.<br> Time to man up.<br> And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.<br> Some of us<br> might not even make it back.<br> What do you mean?<br> Like not on the same flight?<br> Alpa and I's already wearing<br> earth mama's natural night camo.<br> - Cool it, Benson.<br> - Sorry.<br> We gonna scout, get a plan together.<br> We ain't back in 20, come looking.<br> We are Flaming Dragon.<br> Okay.<br> Flaming Dragon's<br> a heroin manufacturer.<br> They're responsible<br> for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.<br> - Huge profit margin.<br> - Guys!<br> Would somebody please let me know<br> what the game plan is?<br> Peck! We have it handled.<br> Please, don't interrupt.<br> Everything's under control.<br> I got it. Got it.<br> - Les Grossman.<br> - We not get money yet.<br> Price now 100 million!<br> You pay now,<br> or tomorrow Simple Jack die.<br> Great. Let me get this down.<br> Wait!

Go to town!<br> - No...<br> - In the meantime, and as usual,<br> go fuck yourself!<br> - No.<br> - We don't negotiate with terrorists.<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<br> Hey, hey, are you insane?<br> - I think I could've done that better.<br> - I thought it was good.<br> They're gonna kill him!<br> And?<br> "And?"<br> It's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.<br> We'll weep for him, in the press.<br> Set up a scholarship in his name.<br> Eventually, and I'm talking way,<br> way down the road,<br> we file an insurance claim.<br> Preferably before<br> the end of the fiscal year.<br> Actually, the claim alone would net us<br> more than the movie would lose.<br> You can't be serious.<br> You kick in the door to my house,<br> all ants in your pants,<br> sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap<br> for the third runner-up<br> Sexiest Man Alive 1998,<br> and you're asking if I'm serious?<br> Let's face it.<br> The kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher<br> for Purim anymore.<br> Speedman is a dying star,<br> a white dwarf heading for a black hole.<br> That's physics. It's inevitable.<br> We've been handed<br> an incredible opportunity here, Peck.<br> The universe is talking to us right now.<br> You just gotta listen.<br> See, this is the good part, Pecker.<br> This is when the job gets fun.<br> Yeah.<br> Ask and you shall receive.<br> - All right.<br> - You play ball, we play ball.<br> I know you want the goodies.<br> Welcome to the goody room.<br> You paying attention?<br> 'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.<br> That's how you're gonna roll.<br> No more frequent flier<br> bitch miles for my boy.<br> Yeah!<br> Playa.<br> Playa!<br> Big dick playa.<br> Swinging past your knees!<br> Big dick, baby.<br> Yep.<br> Or you can grow a conscience<br> in the next five minutes<br> and see where that takes you.<br> Let me get this straight.<br> You want me<br> to let my client of 15 years,<br> one of my best friends,<br> die in the jungle, alone,<br> for some money and a G5?<br> Yes.<br> A G5 airplane?<br> Yes.<br> And lots of money.<br> Playa.<br> Yeah!<br> Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!<br> But Mama take care of Jack a lot.<br> How many more sleeps<br> before she wakes up again?<br> Sorry, Jack.<br> She in heaven now.<br> Damn! I thought the movie was bad.<br> She sleep forever.<br> To the man's credit, he's actually<br> eased up on the retard throttle.<br> And now that's added a balance,<br> and the audience can connect.<br> I mean, this is Theater 101,<br> but, you know, he's had a tough road.<br> He'll become a naturalist.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Break down the aesthetic distance,<br> then the...<br> Told you I'd tag you back.<br> Can I tell you that I'm sorry<br> for any offense I might've caused, man?<br> - I just got caught up in...<br> - In being a dumbass?<br> I guess so.<br> Why you still doing this<br> Chicken George shit, I have no idea.<br> - Neither do I.<br> - It's beyond me.<br> - It's beyond me.<br> - You confused.<br> - I am a little confused.<br> - I know.<br> But are we cool?<br> Not really.<br> Hey, man.<br> - How's it going?<br> - Good.

Literally, a tree.<br> And you can, no matter what, you can't<br> fucking untie me until it is done,<br> until it is out of my system.<br> I'm gonna say,<br> "Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool.<br> "I'm finally better.

It's simple as pie, man.<br> You plant your feet in the ground, you<br> look her square in the eyes, you say,<br> "Hey, baby, you and me's going<br> on a date." That's the end of story.<br> - What's her name?<br> - Lance.<br> "Listen here, Lance..."<br> Lance?
