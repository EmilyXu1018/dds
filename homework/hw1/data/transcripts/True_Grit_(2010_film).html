We want to make<br> an early start for home.<br> I'm going back in there.<br> I want to get my money back!<br> Not full of whisky and with a gun.<br> That's no way.<br> - A gun'll say a whole lot quick.<br> - I won't allow you to get into trouble.<br> - Gimme your gun.<br> - I'll give you one end of it!<br> Gimme the gun! Gimme your gun!<br> All aboard!<br> Where's the undertaker?<br> Round the corner<br> from the courthouse, ma'am.<br> Thank you.<br> I can't understand<br> all these people being here.<br> Everybody comes in from every place.<br> - I'd like to know why.<br> - They're hanging three men today.<br> We'd better go and see about Papa.<br> GESCHLOSSEN.<br> BIN BEl DER HINRICHTUNG.<br> Looks like he's out<br> rustling up business for himself.<br> Seems like we have some time<br> to waste before we see anybody.<br> I can tell you want to go to the hanging.<br> Afraid I can't.<br> Your mama said keep an eye on you.<br> Well, I'll go along.<br> Don't worry, I won't tell Mama.<br> I was once lost<br> But now am found<br> Was blind but now I see<br> 'Twas grace that taught<br> My heart to fear<br> And grace my fears relieved<br> How sweet the sound...<br> That man up there on the porch...<br> That's Judge Parker.<br> He watches all the hangings.<br> - He says it's his sense of duty.<br> - Who knows what's in a man's heart?<br> ... Amen.<br> The hangman's a Yankee.<br> They say he won't spring the trap<br> on a boy that wore the blue.<br> No, I'm here, I'll see it all.<br> My goodness!<br> That's not a faint-hearted judge.<br> Chaney'll get his due<br> before such a judge.<br> Is that the man?<br> That is my father.<br> If you would like to kiss him,<br> it would be all right.<br> No...<br> Put the lid on it.<br> I'm Mattie Ross<br> of Dardanelle in Yell County.<br> And this is my friend, Yarnell<br> Pointdexter, who works on our place.<br> Yes, ma'am. State your business.<br> My father was killed in Fort Smith<br> by a coward named Tom Chaney.<br> What are you doing<br> about the murder?<br> We do know this: His name's<br> Chambers, he's in Indian territory.<br> We think he robbed a mail hack<br> Tuesday down on the Poteau River.<br> He's medium height,<br> with a black mark on his cheek.<br> That's Tom Chaney.<br> There's no Chambers to it.<br> He got that black mark<br> when a man fired a pistol in his face.<br> - Why aren't you out looking for him?<br> - I've no authority in the Indian Nation.<br> He's now the business<br> of the US Marshal.<br> - Who's the best marshal they have?<br> - Bill Waters is the best tracker.<br> The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn,<br> double-tough, knows no fear.<br> L T Quinn is the straightest.<br> He brings them in alive.<br> - Where would I find this Rooster?<br> - At the Federal Court this afternoon.<br> He's bringing in prisoners<br> from the territory.<br> - Is Chaney one of them?<br> - I don't know. That's federal business.<br> Your father's gun...<br> you'll want to take it home, I expect.<br> His saddle is<br> at Colonel Stonehill's stock barn,<br> and the rest of his things are<br> at the Monarch boarding house.<br> I won't rest till Tom Chaney's<br> barking in hell!<br> Yarnell...<br> You stay with Papa.<br> When you get home, put him<br> in a better coffin with Mason's apron.<br> Your mama wants you home.<br> Mama knows I can take care of myself.<br> Tell her not to sign anything till I return.<br> People'll take it wrong<br> that I leave this to you,<br> but I got Papa's business to see to.<br> Tell Mama I'm staying<br> at the Monarch boarding house.<br> I'm going to see<br> if Tom Chaney's been brought in.<br> And then I'll see this Rooster Cogburn.<br> All right, get outta the way!<br> Back up!<br> Stand up!<br> Come on out!<br> Move along!<br> Are the prisoners<br> from the Indian Territory?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Is one of them Tom Chaney?<br> Cogburn ain't turned in his list yet.<br> - Which marshal is Rooster Cogburn?<br> - The big fella with the eye-patch.<br> Come on!<br> All right, take it away!<br> - Mr Cogburn!<br> - Wait! Come back here!<br> Mr Cogburn!<br> Come back here!<br> All right, come on up.<br> If he thinks I'm put off by a locked door,<br> he doesn't know me!<br> - I'll be here when it opens.<br> - Then you'll be mighty hungry.<br> Best time to nail him is tomorrow.<br> He's testifying before Judge Parker.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I appreciate your kindness.<br> Have some more dumplings, dear?<br> At 25 cents per meal,<br> I might just as well.<br> I was hoping you were enjoying them.<br> They're all right. I can't see 25 cents<br> in a little flour and grease.<br> - You're late, Mr La Boof.<br> - The French is 'La Boeuf'.<br> I call it 'La Beef'.<br> Mr La Beef came in this evening.<br> Your spurs, please.<br> My poor chairs are scratched<br> enough already.<br> A right fancy rig, sir.<br> Watch out<br> for the chicken and dumplings.<br> - They'll hurt your eyes.<br> - How's that?<br> They'll hurt your eyes<br> looking for the chicken!<br> You squirrel-headed bastard!<br> Howdy. What's your name?<br> I'd like to go to bed now. But first<br> I'd like to see my father's traps.<br> I'll take a guess<br> and say your name is Mattie Ross.<br> - Mr La Beef is a handsome man.<br> - He needs a bath and a shave.<br> - He hails from Texas.<br> - Judge he's proud of his cowlick.<br> - How did he guess my name?<br> - He's a good guesser, I guess!<br> We're short of rooms<br> on account of the hanging.<br> You'll sleep in here<br> with Grandma Turner.<br> Don't worry about Grandma Turner,<br> she's used to doubling up.<br> I take it my rent will be half, then?<br> These are your father's traps.<br> The watch and the knife are inside.<br> Chaney stole his money and his horse.<br> What do you think<br> of Marshal Rooster Cogburn?<br> Rooster Cogburn! I've heard<br> some terrible things about him!<br> He loves to pull a cork, I know that!<br> His Honour, Judge Parker!<br> All rise!<br> I'll have a peppermint<br> to settle my stomach.<br> Yes, sir.<br> The United States Court<br> of the Western District,<br> having criminal jurisdiction in the Indian<br> Territory, is now in session.<br> Is that Judge Parker,<br> the hanging judge?<br> He's a tough customer. There's no<br> appeal except to the President himself!<br> Call Deputy Marshal Cogburn.<br> Mr Reuben J Cogburn<br> will take the stand.<br> You were sworn this morning,<br> you're still sworn.<br> Defence will cross-examine.<br> Mr Cogburn, you testified<br> for the prosecution this morning.<br> Allow me to summarise what you said.<br> According to your story...<br> ...C C Wharton grabbed a shotgun<br> and killed Marshal Potter.<br> Then he turned the gun on you,<br> and you shot him.<br> Then the father swung his axe,<br> and you shot him, too.<br> The defendant tried to run,<br> you say, and you also shot him.<br> Just winged him,<br> or he wouldn't be here to pay up!<br> The old man and CC hit the ground dead.<br> How long have you been<br> a Deputy Marshal, Mr Cogburn?<br> Four years, come March.<br> How many men have you shot<br> in that time?<br> - The prosecution objects!<br> - Overruled!<br> How many men have you shot<br> since becoming a marshal?<br> - I never shot nobody I didn't have to!<br> - That's not the question. How many?<br> Shot or killed?<br> Let's restrict it to killed,<br> a more manageable figure!<br> Well, twelve to fifteen, stopping men<br> in flight and defending myself.<br> Twelve to fifteen? So many<br> you can't keep a specific count.<br> I have examined the records.<br> A more accurate figure is available.<br> Come now, how many?<br> Counting them two Whartons,<br> twenty-three.<br> I felt you'd come to it<br> with a little effort.<br> Twenty-three dead men in four years.<br> That makes about six men a year!<br> - It's a dangerous business.<br> - How much more for those you arrest!<br> Is it not true that<br> you sprang upon the Whartons<br> with a deadly six-shot revolver?<br> - I always try to be ready.<br> - Was this revolver loaded and cocked?<br> A gun that's unloaded<br> ain't good for nothing!<br> Just answer, if you please.<br> - The question don't make sense!<br> - Don't bandy words with counsel.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You testified you backed away<br> from old man Wharton.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Which direction?<br> Backward! I always go backward<br> when I'm backing away!<br> I appreciate the humour of that remark.<br> Aaron Wharton was standing by a pot<br> when you arrived?<br> More like squatting.<br> He was stirring the fire under the pot.<br> - How far did you back away?<br> - Six, eight steps.<br> Meaning Wharton advanced the same<br> distance? Six or eight steps?<br> - Sixteen feet?<br> - Something like that.<br> Then explain why the body was found<br> by the wash pot,<br> one arm in the flames,<br> the sleeve and hand smouldering.<br> Them hogs!<br> They may have moved the body.<br> Hogs, indeed!<br> Mr Goudy, do you have<br> any more questions?<br> None that I'll get a straight answer to.<br> I'm finished with him.<br> You're dismissed, Mr Cogburn.<br> Call the next witness!<br> Cecil Falling Leaf, take the stand!<br> Raise your right hand...<br> - Mr Rooster Cogburn?<br> - What is it?<br> I'd like to talk with you a minute.<br> They say you're a man with true grit.<br> What do you want? Speak up!<br> You've already wrinkled the paper...<br> It's pretty loose<br> because your makings are too dry.<br> I'm looking for Tom Chaney.<br> Well, who's he?<br> He shot and killed my father,<br> Frank Ross.<br> He's in the Indian Territory.<br> I need somebody to go after him.<br> - Who are you?<br> - Mattie Ross.<br> My family has 480 acres<br> of good bottomland in Yell County.<br> Mother's home looking after<br> my baby sister and brother.<br> Why don't you go home<br> and leave me alone?<br> They'll need help with the churning!<br> Mr Cogburn!<br> You can get a fugitive warrant<br> for Chaney and $2 for bringing him in,<br> plus 10 cents a mile for each of you,<br> and I'll give you $50 reward!<br> You've looked into this right smart.<br> Yes, I mean business.<br> What have you got in your poke?<br> By God, girl, that's a Colt's Dragoon!<br> You're no bigger than a corn nubbin.<br> What are you doing with this pistol?<br> My father carried it bravely in the war.<br> I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it<br> if the law fails.<br> This'll sure get the job done,<br> if you can find a fence post to rest it on<br> while you take aim!<br> I'm afraid nothing'll be done<br> about Chaney unless I do it myself.<br> - I don't think you've got $50.<br> - After my horse-trading, I'll have it.<br> Do you know the robber<br> Lucky Ned Pepper?<br> I know him... well!<br> I shot him in the lip last August<br> over at Winding Stair Mountains.<br> He was lucky that day,<br> my shooting was off!<br> Well, I think Chaney's<br> tied up with him.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah!<br> - Ned Pepper, huh?<br> - Yeah...<br> Baby sister, I don't think<br> you can get $50.<br> But I'll take you home<br> and give you supper.<br> We'll talk it over, make medicine.<br> How does that suit you?<br> Right down to the ground.<br> I'd like to meet your family.<br> This is my father, Chen Lee.<br> And my nephew,<br> General Sterling Price.<br> You want more, Missy?<br> I've had enough,<br> and enough is as good as a feast.<br> I've never seen chopsticks work before.<br> Chopsticks save the fingers.<br> - Gimme your cup.<br> - I don't drink coffee, thank you.<br> - Well, what do you drink?<br> - I'm partial to cold buttermilk.<br> Well, we ain't got none of that.<br> We ain't got no lemonade either.<br> Let's get to the game.<br> - My deal?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - What about my proposition?<br> - Thinking on it.<br> Sounds like a mighty easy way<br> to make $50 to me.<br> Don't crowd me, I'm figuring expenses.<br> How you can play cards, drink whisky<br> and think detective at the same time?<br> Well, if I have to go up against<br> Ned Pepper, it'll cost $100, I figure.<br> And 50 in advance.<br> - You're trying to take advantage of me.<br> - They're my children's rates!<br> It isn't going to be easy<br> smoking old Ned out.<br> He'll be holed up<br> down that Indian Nation.<br> Well, I'm not going<br> to keep you in whisky!<br> I don't buy that, I confiscate it!<br> A touch of it wouldn't do you<br> any harm against the night air!<br> It's the real article,<br> genuine double-rectified bust-head!<br> Aged in the keg.<br> I would not put a thief in my mouth<br> to steal my brains.<br> Well, sis, my price is $100.<br> There it is. Want to make medicine?<br> I will think about your proposition.<br> You better walk me<br> over to the boarding house.<br> You are a lot of trouble.<br> Wait till I finish this hand.<br> You can't tell what's in a Chinaman's<br> mind. That's the way he bests you!<br> I go.<br> Scat!<br> Mr Rat...<br> My writ here says you must stop<br> eating Chen Lee's cornmeal forthwith.<br> It's a rat writ, writ for a rat,<br> and this is lawful service of same.<br> See, he doesn't pay any attention to me.<br> Outside is the place for shooting!<br> I'm serving some papers.<br> That was your job in the first place!<br> You can't serve papers<br> on a rat, baby sister.<br> You've got to kill him or let him be.<br> Are you going to drink all of that?<br> Judge Parker... Old Carpetbagger!<br> But he knows his rats.<br> We had a good court...<br> ...until those pettifogging lawyers<br> moved in.<br> The ratcatcher's too tough on the rats!<br> "Give them rats a fair show," they say.<br> What fair show<br> did they give old man Potter?<br> Tell me that. Finer man never lived.<br> You're useless in this condition.<br> I'll walk over there by myself.<br> - You scared of the dark?<br> - Never!<br> If I had a big horse-pistol like that,<br> I wouldn't be scared of the booger man.<br> I'm not scared of no booger man.<br> - Sugar?<br> - No thanks.<br> - Cream?<br> - Please.<br> Just a dab.<br> Miss Ross!<br> I'd like some private words with you.<br> And you I find a sweet distraction,<br> as most men do.<br> - Will you excuse us?<br> - Of course, Mr La Beef.<br> What do you want of me?<br> Who are you?<br> I'm nobody yet,<br> but I expect to go high.<br> How?<br> To begin with, I expect to marry well.<br> You have the haircomb for it.<br> - How did you know my name?<br> - I saw your mother yesterday.<br> What business did you have with her?<br> This.

There's a lady in Waco<br> who'd look favourably on me.<br> A hanging in Texas<br> would serve just as well.<br> No! I want Chaney to pay for killing<br> my father, not for some bird dog!<br> It won't be for the dog!<br> Lt'll be for the senator and your father.<br> He'll be just as dead.<br> If I couldn't find Chaney in 4 months,<br> I would not advise others how to do it!<br> Earlier I thought<br> of stealing a kiss from you,<br> although you are very young<br> and unattractive to boot!<br> But now I'd sooner give you<br> some licks with my belt!<br> One would be as unpleasant<br> as the other!<br> You Texans are ignorant of our ways.<br> We don't go easy on men<br> who abuse women and children.<br> Texan children show more respect<br> for their elders.<br> Texans gouge their horses with brutal<br> spurs and cultivate their hair like lettuce!<br> You'll push that saucy line too far.<br> I have no regard for you,<br> but I'm sure you have enough<br> for yourself to go around!<br> They are all for sale.<br> Except those four scrubby ones.<br> - And... who do they belong to?<br> - The heirs of the late Frank Ross.<br> I'm Mattie Ross, and I'd like<br> to sell you back those ponies.<br> That's out of the question.<br> My father bought them for breeding,<br> but they're all geldings.<br> - You cannot breed geldings.<br> - That hardly concerns me.<br> He bought four ponies for $100,<br> and there's an end of it.<br> I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse,<br> stolen from your barn.<br> - Take that up with the man who stole it.<br> - He stole it while it was in your care.<br> You are responsible.<br> I admire your sand, but... l'm not liable.<br> - I will take it to the law.<br> - Do as you think best.<br> We'll see if a widow and three children<br> can get fair treatment in these courts.<br> - You have no case.<br> - Lawyer Daggett may think otherwise.<br> - You are impudent.<br> - I do not wish to be, sir.<br> But I will not be pushed about.<br> - I'll take it up with my attorney.<br> - And I with mine.<br> He and I will make money,<br> and your lawyer will make money.<br> And you, Mr Auctioneer, will foot the bill!<br> You're a damned nuisance!<br> Who is this famous pleader, of whom<br> I was ignorant 10 minutes ago?<br> You've heard of the Great Arkansas<br> River Vicksburg and Gulf Company?<br> I have done business<br> with the GAV & G, yes.<br> My lawyer forced them<br> into receivership.<br> They tried to mess with him.<br> All right, come inside.<br> Sit down.<br> I will pay a total of $200<br> to your father's estate<br> when I have in my hand<br> a letter absolving me of all liability<br> from the beginning<br> of the world to date!<br> I want $200 for the horse duty<br> plus another $100 for the ponies.<br> The ponies have no part in this.<br> I won't buy them back.<br> I'll keep the ponies, and the price<br> for Judy will be $300.<br> I wouldn't pay that for Pegasus!<br> Listen, as I will not bargain further.<br> I will take the ponies back,<br> keep your father's saddle for $200.<br> My lawyer would not wish me<br> to consider anything under $300.<br> That's for everything<br> except the saddle.<br> I would like to have that in writing,<br> for what it's worth.<br> When I have it in my hand,<br> I'll remit the extortion money.<br> This is your release.<br> You'll find it in order.<br> You had that already written out.<br> - I'll give you a cheque.<br> - I prefer cash.<br> One hundred, two hundred...<br> ...three hundred.<br> You'll find a buyer<br> for those ponies very soon.<br> I have a tentative offer of $10 a head<br> from the soap works at Little Rock.<br> Such a shame to render<br> spirited horseflesh into soap.<br> - I'm sure the deal will fall through.<br> - Expect me back for my saddle.<br> I'm sure I can!<br> Do you know<br> a Marshal Rooster Cogburn?<br> Most people know Rooster Cogburn,<br> and some live to regret it.<br> I wouldn't be surprised to learn<br> he's a relative of yours!<br> - Morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Where's Mr Cogburn?<br> - Sleep late.

How much is there?<br> You still game?<br> I was born game,<br> and I intend to go out that way.<br> All right, one understanding:<br> We leave this afternoon to get him.<br> - You're not going!<br> - You misjudge me.<br> I can't go up against Pepper's gang,<br> looking after a baby at the same time!<br> - I'm not a baby.<br> - There's no hot grub or warm beds.<br> I've slept out at night before<br> while hunting coons.<br> This ain't no coon-hunt.<br> It's no place for a kid.<br> - They said that about coon-hunting.<br> - You'll be calling for Mama!<br> I've left off crying.<br> Make up your mind. If you're not<br> game, I'll find somebody who is.<br> I know you can drink whisky,<br> and I saw you kill a rat,<br> but all the rest has been talk,<br> and I'm not paying for talk.<br> - I ought to paddle your rump!<br> - How do you propose to do that?<br> If I smelled as bad as you,<br> I wouldn't live near people!<br> I've made up a short agreement<br> between us.<br> Sign it.<br> Here's $25.<br> I'll give you another $25 when we<br> leave and $50 when the job is done.<br> We can get started at first light.<br> We'll cross the ferry and talk<br> to an informer in the Indian Nation.<br> He might know something.<br> I'll be more than ready.<br> Well, General...<br> Look what we got.<br> There's an old saw that says:<br> "One white foot, buy him,"<br> "two white feet, try him,"<br> "three white feet, be on the sly,"<br> "four white feet, pass him by."<br> But I don't hold with that.<br> I just heard that a young girl fell<br> head first into a fifty-foot well.<br> I thought perhaps it was you.<br> No, it was not I.<br> What do you hear<br> from the soap man?<br> - Nothing.<br> - I'll take one of the ponies.<br> The black one with the white<br> stockings. I'll call him Little Blackie.<br> - What is your offer?<br> - The market price.<br> The soap man offered you<br> $10 a head...<br> That is a lot price. I paid you<br> $25 a head only this morning.<br> - That was the price then.<br> - Tell me this...<br> Do you entertain plans<br> of ever leaving this city?<br> Yes, I'm off early tomorrow morning<br> for the Indian Nation.<br> Marshal Cogburn and I are going<br> after the murderer Tom Chaney.<br> Cogburn...<br> How did you light<br> on that greasy vagabond?<br> They say he has grit.<br> - I wanted a man with grit.<br> - I suppose he has that.<br> He's a notorious thumper. Not a man<br> I would care to share a bed with.<br> - Nor would I.<br> - I wouldn't trust him too much.<br> I paid a token payment. The balance<br> is paid when the job's done.<br> It may prove to be<br> a long, hard journey.<br> A Christian does not flinch<br> from these difficulties.<br> Neither does he rashly court them.<br> He is not wilful or presumptuous.<br> - You think I'm wrong?<br> - I think you are wrong-headed.<br> I'll pay $12 for that pony...<br> ...if you shoe him for me.<br> I will not ride a barefoot pony.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning!<br> Howdy!<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Having a chat with the marshal.<br> Sit down, sis, have some taffy.<br> This jaybird says<br> he's on the track of the same man.<br> I told him we're not interested.<br> He's gone behind my back.<br> A fella that carries a big-bore carbine<br> might come in handy,<br> if we get jumped<br> by elephants or buffalo!<br> We don't need him.<br> - Everything ready?<br> - All but the grub.<br> I must have the wrong man.<br> - You let little girls hooraw you?<br> - Mind repeating that, jaybird?<br> The marshal's working for me.<br> - How much is she paying you?<br> - Enough.<br> Is she paying you $500?<br> No.<br> That's what the Governor of Texas<br> is paying on conviction of Chaney.<br> $500? Very little for a man<br> who's killed a senator.<br> Bibbs was a little senator.<br> I guess I'll just stick with sis.<br> The Bibbs family's put up<br> another $1,500 for Chaney.<br> - What are the terms?<br> - Just deliver Chaney, alive or dead.<br> That's more to my liking.<br> How will you split up the money?<br> If we take him alive, I'll split<br> the $1,500 and keep the state's $500.<br> If we kill him, I'll give you $500<br> of the Bibbs' money.<br> I don't want Chaney<br> taken back to Texas.<br> - He wants him punished, so do you.<br> - I want him to hang for my father.<br> I don't care about senators in Texas.<br> You can tell him to his face.<br> You can make him eat sand.<br> You can shoot him in the foot,<br> but first we gotta catch him!<br> - You can't have it all your own way.<br> - I've paid for it so I'll have it my way.<br> I don't understand at all.<br> She ain't going anyhow.<br> Go home to your mama.<br> - I told her she could go.<br> - No. She'll make trouble.<br> Maybe I'll catch this Chaney<br> by myself and take all the money.<br> You might deliver him,<br> but I'd see you didn't collect a thing.<br> - How'd you do that?<br> - I'd dispute your claim.<br> Do that, and I'll kill you.<br> Don't count on shading someone<br> you don't know, fella.<br> I ain't seen no one from Texas<br> I couldn't shade!<br> La Beef, you cross me and you'd think<br> a thousand bricks had fell on you.<br> You'll wish you was back<br> at the Alamo!<br> Knock him down, Rooster!<br> That reward's just La Beef's talk.<br> I've given you good cash.<br> He'll cheat you!<br> A fella's gotta think about himself<br> sometimes, sister.<br> We'll get your man,<br> that's the main thing.<br> Give me my $25 back. Hand it over!<br> I spent it.<br> - You sorry piece of trash.<br> - I'll get it for you.<br> If you think you can cheat me,<br> you're mistaken.<br> You may well hear from my lawyer!<br> Lawyer? What lawyer?<br> Don't worry about him.<br> Worry about our business at hand.<br> - Red.<br> - Morning.<br> - River looks kind of high.<br> - It's been raining up-country.<br> - Who are you looking for this time?<br> - If I told you, you might tell him.<br> Well... you're well enough armed.<br> I'd say, "Tom Chaney, look out!"<br> Can't you get anything through<br> your head?

Go back!<br> - I'll do no such thing!<br> La Beef...<br> Those horses can't get away<br> from Little Blackie.<br> They're loaded down<br> with fat men and iron.<br> Now we'll see what tune you sing!<br> - I'll raise welts on you like worms!<br> - See what good it does you.<br> You're not hurting me.

Get on your horse.<br> Presbyterian, huh?<br> Southern or Cumberland?<br> - Southern.<br> - My folks are Cumberland.<br> I was raised in the Episcopal Church.<br> I figured you<br> for some kind of kneeler!<br> What did you learn?<br> Ned was sighted at McAlester's store<br> about three days ago.<br> He goes there from time to time<br> to see a lewd woman.<br> A thief named Haze is with him and<br> a Mexican on a round-bellied pony.<br> Chaney wasn't seen, but he was in<br> on that mail hijacking job.<br> Stew?<br> - This is worse than a pig trail!<br> - Shortest way to McAlester's.<br> - How far is it?<br> - Around 60 miles.<br> We'll make 15 today<br> and get an early start tomorrow.<br> How do you like this coon-hunt?<br> Don't be looking around for me.<br> I'll be right here.<br> You look like a hog on ice!<br> The bucket's heavy.<br> I'm stronger than I look.<br> - What did you bring to eat?<br> - Salt.<br> Red pepper.<br> Taffy.<br> - Carry those in your pockets?<br> - Yeah.

Moon!<br> That's him hollering.<br> That's the original<br> Mexican Bob with him.<br> - There's more than one?<br> - There's a younger one.<br> But he ain't a patch to this one.<br> Moon!<br> Quincy!<br> Now he's done it!<br> Over here, Ned!<br> I'm hit.<br> They don't call him<br> Lucky Ned Pepper for nothing.<br> That man gave his life for him.<br> He didn't even look back.<br> Looking back is a bad habit.<br> Well...<br> What's your story?<br> I was on the move to a better place,<br> and I heard the first shot.<br> More likely asleep!<br> - You know who they are?<br> - The one on the sand spit's Haze.<br> The boy? I don't know.<br> He's not much older than I am.<br> That's nothing but a little scratch.<br> That's nothing to do with you.<br> Go make us some coffee!<br> - It won't take long.<br> - Let it go and go on inside!<br> Why are you being so foolish?<br> - You're quite a horse-shooter.<br> - I was trying for Ned Pepper.<br> Next time try for the horse<br> and maybe you'll hit Pepper!<br> What are we waiting for?<br> Let's ride after them.<br> I say no. I know<br> where they're going to earth.<br> You can't take men<br> by watching them run away.<br> I know this country,<br> and I know these men.<br> We'll take the horses<br> and the dead into McAlester,<br> and I'll put in a claim for any reward<br> the railroad may offer.<br> - You backed up?<br> - Some... for now.<br> - Damn a man that whistles!<br> - He's keeping his mind off his hand.<br> You don't think<br> very much of me, do you?<br> I don't think about you at all,<br> if you keep quiet.<br> I was told that you rode<br> with Quantrell and that border trash.<br> I heard Quantrell and his men weren't<br> soldiers but murdering thieves.<br> I heard the same thing.<br> I heard they murdered<br> women and children.<br> I heard that, too,<br> and it's a damn lie.<br> What outfit were you with<br> during the war?<br> - Shreveport, with Kirby Smith.<br> - I mean what side were you on?<br> I served with General Kirby Smith.<br> I don't have to hang my head<br> when I say it.<br> Go ahead, make me look<br> foolish in her eyes.<br> You don't need me for that.<br> I don't like the way<br> you make conversation.<br> I don't like your conversation<br> about Captain Quantrell.<br> Captain? Captain of what?<br> A bunch of thieves?<br> Young fella, if you're looking<br> for trouble, I'll accommodate you.<br> Otherwise... leave it alone.<br> I've been thinking about Pepper.<br> Maybe he'd have murdered those two<br> so they wouldn't inform on him.<br> - Ned wouldn't do that.<br> - Why not?<br> He doesn't kill people for no reason.<br> Had he a reason, he'd kill them.<br> Looks like we might joggle<br> some of our passengers off.<br> Well, they're past hurting.<br> - We'll tie up here, if you don't mind?<br> - Sure, marshal, you've quite a load.<br> Yeah... about half the load<br> I was looking for.<br> Go in and meet Mrs McAlester,<br> she'll fix some dinner.<br> - I want a word with the peace officer.<br> - I'll go, too.<br> I'll tell the wife<br> to fix something for all of you.<br> You go inside, maybe Mrs McAlester<br> can fix that poor little hand of yours!<br> My poor little hand can keep.<br> Rooster! What are you doing here?<br> Boots! Gaspargo!<br> You're letting that Indian<br> behind you with a blade?<br> - 'Cause I'm an Indian.<br> - Plenty of scalps on Indian belts!<br> If you're after Ned Pepper,<br> you're on a cold trail here.<br> We're looking for another man, too.<br> Black mark on his face.<br> - We think he's running with Ned.<br> - That's a Texan peace officer!<br> Ned passed through<br> a couple of days ago.<br> Him, Haze, Mexican Bob.<br> Only those three were seen.<br> - I know where Ned's holed up.<br> - You'll need 100 marshals to get him!<br> My name is Mattie Ross<br> from Yell County.<br> That man with the black mark<br> killed my father. He's called Chaney.<br> I got Haze and some youngster<br> outside with Moon and Quincy.<br> I want you to bury 'em for me.<br> I'm in a hurry.<br> They're dead?<br> I wouldn't want you to bury them<br> if they weren't!<br> - What about La Beef's hand?<br> - Gaspargo's a good doctor, too.<br> - Take care of it.<br> - It can wait.<br> - You're no good use if handicapped.<br> - And small use if he ain't!<br> - Wash first.<br> - Why?<br> - Don't you wash before you eat?<br> - Ain't gonna eat his hand.<br> - Don't you know about germs?<br> - No...<br> Go wash, Gaspargo.<br> You lost!<br> That's Moon.<br> Quincy.<br> Haze! First time he ever stayed shot!<br> I know this boy. Billy Walsh.<br> Comes from a good family.<br> Hold good Billy for his folks<br> and bury the rest of them.<br> I'll post their names. If anyone<br> wants them, they can dig them up.<br> Sell their horses, coats, guns<br> and saddles, and I'll split it with you.<br> You told Moon<br> you'd send money to his brother.<br> - I forget where to send it.<br> - The Methodist church, Austin.<br> Are you sure it was Austin<br> and not Dallas?<br> You know it was Austin!<br> Write it out for the captain.<br> Boots, send this man $10<br> and tell him he's buried here.<br> I'll do that. So this man shot<br> Ned Pepper's horse?<br> Yeah, this is the famous<br> horse-killer from El Paso!<br> He believes in putting everybody<br> afoot. Less mischief that way.<br> Fewer horses, fewer horse-thieves!<br> How's your hand?<br> Both rifle and hand<br> are ready to shoot again.<br> Straighter than before, I hope!<br> Well, sister!<br> The time has come<br> for me to ride hard and fast.<br> You stay here with the McAlesters,<br> and I'll be back soon with Chaney.<br> - You can't get shed of me.<br> - She's come this far.<br> - It's far enough.<br> - I won't quit when we're so close.<br> There's something in what<br> she's saying. She's won her spurs.<br> Let it go. I've said my piece.<br> - No more talk of "winning spurs"!<br> - I'm going.<br> Not because you say I can or can't.<br> I paid good money to be here,<br> and I'm on my own business.<br> We'll have no more talk about it!<br> Let's eat!<br> What are you doing?<br> Looking for a sign.<br> You couldn't see it if you saw it!<br> We'll walk a ways.<br> You looking for a sign again?<br> It was Bo.<br> He put his foot wrong.<br> He's tired.<br> This is no grade.<br> I've freighted iron stoves up<br> harder grades than this.<br> We'll camp here.<br> Here...<br> I was a pretty fair hand with a jerk-line<br> when I was freighting in Colorado.<br> I worked for a fella that was<br> always down with something.<br> He was carrying a 21-foot tapeworm<br> with his business responsibilities.<br> That aged him!<br> His wife commenced running things.<br> I wasn't about to work for her,<br> so I told her so.<br> Women have no generosity.<br> Lord God, how they hate to pay up!<br> A man will never work for a woman<br> unless he's got clabber for brains!<br> What about the $25 I paid you?<br> What $25?<br> I will not bandy words with a drunkard!<br> That's real smart. You've done<br> nothing when you've bested a fool.<br> We have come nearly 50 miles<br> from McAlester's.<br> We're close to Ned Pepper's camp.<br> Tomorrow we'll take him.<br> If we're as close as you say,<br> I don't think you should make a fire.<br> Nobody asked you.<br> Where are you going<br> with that canteen?<br> Wash the sleep off me.<br> We got no water to spare for that.<br> Just take a drink!<br> I'd say there's a stream down below.<br> You wash and you'll get no breakfast!<br> We'll waste no more time.<br> Shouldn't one of us go down with her?<br> It might not be safe.<br> It's safer for her<br> than whatever she meets...<br> ...man or beast!<br> I know you. Little Mattie.<br> And I know you, Tom Chaney.<br> What are you doing? There's<br> no money for you to squeeze here.<br> - I came to fetch water.<br> - That was not my meaning.<br> I'm here to take you back<br> to Fort Smith and hang you.<br> I won't go.<br> How do you like that?<br> There's a posse of officers<br> up the hill that'll force you to go.<br> - How many officers?<br> - I'd say 50, and they mean business.<br> So you just walk<br> right in front of me up that hill.<br> I think I'll oblige<br> those officers to come after me.<br> If you refuse, I'll have to shoot you.<br> Is that so?<br> You'd better cock your piece.<br> All the way back until it locks.<br> I know how to do it.<br> You're saying you won't go<br> with me of your own free will?<br> You just got it the other way around.<br> Now you follow me!<br> - I didn't think you'd do it.<br> - Sis!<br> - Where are you?<br> - I'm down here. I got Chaney!<br> I just didn't think you'd do it!<br> One of my short ribs is broken!<br> You killed my father,<br> when he was trying to help you.<br> You're just a piece of trash.<br> You also killed a senator in Texas,<br> when he was sitting on a porch swing.<br> Everything happens to me.<br> And now I'm shot by a child!<br> I'll shoot you again if you don't get up!<br> My father took you in<br> when you were hungry.<br> Little busybody! I'll teach you<br> a lesson you'll never forget.<br> Sis! Sis!<br> Hurry up! Down here!<br> Take her and go!<br> Up the hill with the horses<br> and don't stop!<br> Who holds out there?<br> Marshal Rooster Cogburn<br> and fifty other armed officers.<br> Tell me another lie<br> and I'll stove in your head!<br> The truth! Who's out there?<br> Marshal Rooster Cogburn<br> and a Texas Ranger.<br> Rooster!<br> Rooster, can you hear me?<br> You better answer or I'll kill this girl!<br> You know I'll do it!<br> You want me to kill her?<br> Do what you think is best, Ned!<br> Why, you...<br> She's nothing to me!<br> Nothing but a runaway!<br> You and that ranger<br> get moving double fast!<br> If I see you riding over<br> that north ridge, I'll spare the girl.<br> You got five minutes!<br> - We'll need more than five minutes.<br> - I won't give you any more.<br> There'll be a party of marshals<br> coming soon.<br> You give me Tom Chaney,<br> and I'll mislead them for six hours.<br> Throw in that spitfire of a girl, too.<br> Too thin, Rooster, too thin!<br> I won't trust you.<br> Your five minutes are running.<br> You better move!<br> All right, we're moving,<br> but we need more than five minutes.<br> I never busted a cap on a woman<br> or nobody under sixteen. But I'll do it.<br> I'm Mattie Ross of Yell County.<br> My family has property.<br> Why am I being treated like this?<br> Well, it's enough that you know<br> I'll do what I have to do.<br> I saw you shot.<br> Where are your wounds?<br> My wounds heal by themselves<br> from inside.<br> You and Harold stay here,<br> keep a watch out below.<br> Keep this turkeycock quiet<br> or we'll have him for supper.<br> Why don't you shut up?!<br> Is he simple-minded?<br> They're all touched,<br> but Harold's the worst.<br> No, their ma's the worst, then<br> his brother. But they're all good shots.<br> Get down!<br> I'll wring your scrawny neck!<br> No, you won't.<br> Go and get those horses saddled!<br> Lend him a hand.<br> You sit there and be still.<br> Your five minutes is up,<br> they better show.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Chaney shot my father to death.<br> I was told Rooster Cogburn has grit.<br> I hired him to go after the murderer.<br> I shot him myself.<br> If I'd killed him, I wouldn't be in this fix.<br> My gun misfired.<br> Well, they will do it.<br> Most girls like to play pretties,<br> but you like guns.<br> If I did, I'd have one that worked.<br> I'll give them a little more time.<br> - Did Rooster waylay us last night?<br> - Yes.<br> - Did he take Quincy and Moon?<br> - They're both dead.<br> It was terrible to see.<br> Do you need a good lawyer?<br> I need a good judge.<br> That man called Haze, he's dead, too.<br> And the boy that saved your life.<br> I'm happy he did what he did, but<br> he should've looked out for himself.<br> That goes for your good friend,<br> Rooster.<br> Hey, Ned!<br> Rooster Cogburn<br> is no good friend of mine.<br> He's a drunken, gabbing fool.<br> He led us right into your hands<br> and left me with a gang of cut-throats.<br> They call that grit in Fort Smith?<br> We call it something else<br> in Yell County.<br> I was shot from ambush<br> by one of those officers.<br> How can you tell a big story like that?<br> We're five men and four horses.<br> Chaney stays. You lost the horse.<br> I'll send someone to get you<br> with a fresh mount.<br> I'm not staying with Chaney.<br> He won't harm you. Understand?<br> Rooster gave us six hours<br> if we keep her safe. If you don't...<br> ...you don't get paid!<br> - Let me ride with you, Farrell.<br> - No!<br> - How about you, Bob?<br> - No!<br> - Harold?<br> - Cock-a-doodle-doo!<br> - Do it again, Harold! Do a goat!<br> - Baa! Baa!<br> We'll see you tonight at Maw's.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm getting water to wash my hands.<br> A little smut won't hurt you.<br> True. Or else you lot<br> would surely be dead!<br> Don't provoke me.<br> There's rattlesnakes in that pit,<br> and I'll throw you in it!<br> Ned Pepper said if you molest me,<br> he'll not pay you. He's your boss.<br> He's no idea of paying me.<br> He left me knowing I'd be caught.<br> If you let me go now,<br> I'll keep silent about you for two days.<br> I can do better.<br> I can shut you up forever!<br> All right, Chaney. That's enough.<br> Get your hands up.<br> - Get over there.<br> - Everything's against me.<br> - You hurt, Mattie?<br> - I'm the one that's hurt!<br> - Where's Rooster?<br> - Below, in a place we can watch.<br> - Where's Little Blackie?<br> - Rooster's got him.<br> Get over there and stay over there.<br> Watch out, he said<br> there are snakes in that hole.<br> Where's the girl?<br> In wonderful health the last I saw her.<br> I don't know now.<br> Answer for her now. Where is she?<br> Rooster! Make a run for it!<br> I got Mattie. Chaney, too!<br> Will you give us the road?<br> I have business elsewhere.<br> Farrell, you and your brother<br> stand clear.<br> I got no interest in you today.<br> Stand clear, you won't get hurt.<br> Cock-a-doodle-doo!<br> You think one on four's a dogfall?<br> I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.<br> Or see you hanged at Judge Parker's<br> convenience. Which will it be?<br> I call that bold talk<br> for a one-eyed fat man!<br> Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!<br> - Shoot them!<br> - Too far, moving too fast.<br> No grit? Rooster Cogburn? Not much!<br> Well, Rooster...<br> I'm shot to pieces.<br> Hurray for the man from Texas!<br> Some bully shot!<br> Damn you, Bo.<br> First time you ever give me<br> reason to... cuss you!<br> Help me!<br> Help me, I'm in the pit!<br> There's a snake down here<br> and a skeleton.<br> There'll be another one before long.<br> A little spindly one.<br> How do you like it?<br> Help me. Help me.<br> Please help me!<br> Are you saying you don't like it?<br> Baby sister!<br> - Are you down there, sis?<br> - Yes, hurry! I'm in a bad way!<br> All right, hold on.<br> I'm gonna pitch you a rope.<br> Slip it under your arms and tie a knot.<br> I can't! I'm caught<br> and my arm is broken.<br> There are snakes down here.<br> It's in here now!<br> Hang on right here.<br> When you need a damn Texan,<br> he's dead!<br> I ain't dead yet, you bushwacker!<br> Hang on!<br> I want Papa's gun.<br> - I want the other gold piece, too.<br> - You sure you don't want the snake?<br> - No. But I want the gold piece.<br> - Forget it.<br> But it's mine and I want it!<br> That Texican... saved my neck twice.<br> Once after he was dead.<br> We'll have to do something<br> about this snakebite in a hurry.<br> Hold this arm up, little sister.<br> - We can't leave him like this.<br> - I'm the one that's leaving him.<br> If I don't get you a doctor,<br> you'll be deader than he is.<br> - Little Blackie can't carry us both.<br> - He'll have to. He's all I could catch.<br> Stop it!<br> We must stop, he's played out!<br> Stop it! You're killing him!<br> Hold it!<br> Fling them guns into that creek!<br> I'm borrowing this wagon off you.<br> Boots! Finch!<br> Boots!<br> Boots!<br> Am I addressing<br> Marshal Reuben J Cogburn?<br> You're addressing him, Chen Lee<br> and General Sterling Price.<br> Well... l'll not ask which is which.<br> But I'll identify myself.<br> I am lawyer, J Noble Daggett.<br> - I'll be damned!<br> - What?<br> Well, you're not...<br> exactly what we expected.<br> You're a little... You're shrunk!<br> I'll tell you frankly.<br> I fully intended to have you jailed,<br> and I'm just the man who could do it.<br> But when Mattie told me the straight<br> of the matter, I had second thoughts.<br> I still think you showed<br> poor judgement in this affair,<br> but you're not the scoundrel<br> I took you for.<br> You have my thanks and,<br> with certain reservations, my respect.<br> How nice! How is sis?<br> Gravely ill, I'm afraid.<br> But still able to direct her affairs.<br> She commissioned me<br> to pay you the balance of the $75 due.<br> - She didn't ask for a receipt, did she?<br> - As a matter of fact, she did.<br> You will find that it also covers<br> an additional $200...<br> ...for saving her life.<br> Well, I will be damned!<br> She says that when she goes home,<br> she wants you to take her there.<br> Poor child does not know<br> how ill she really is.<br> Lawyer, J Noble Daggett,<br> are you a betting man?<br> On occasion.<br> All of this and General Price,<br> that she makes it back to Yell County.<br> Oh, no!<br> No, sir, no, sir!<br> Why didn't you look up<br> La Beef's girl in Waco?<br> I did the best I could.<br> I took the boy home<br> to be buried in his ranger's suit.<br> No girl showed up.<br> I don't believe there was one.<br> You were too busy<br> collecting the reward.<br> I was just a little busy. They forgot<br> how much the reward was.<br> - I had to help them remember.<br> - I can imagine how you did that!<br> This is what I wanted you to see.<br> Papa's marker was<br> not what was ordered.<br> I had to make<br> that fool of a stoneman change it.<br> Some day, Mama will be here.<br> And my brother<br> and his family over there.<br> And that is for my sister<br> and her family.<br> And I will be here,<br> on the other side of Papa.<br> It's comforting to know<br> where we'll meet eternity.<br> I would like you<br> to rest beside me, Rooster.<br> Now, sis, that place<br> should be for your family,<br> your husband, kids...<br> You have no kin.<br> I don't count Chen Lee and the cat.<br> Where would you end up?<br> A neglected patch of weeds?<br> I might just take you up<br> on that offer, sis.<br> Excuse me<br> if I don't try to move in too soon.<br> I think it's only right<br> that you have Papa's gun.<br> - It might keep you alive.<br> - I'm not so sure about that.<br> Almost got you killed<br> when it misfired once!<br> Because you loaded it wrong<br> in a state of drunkenness.<br> - I ought to get you to show me how.<br> - I will.<br> - Trust you to buy another tall horse.<br> - Yeah...<br> He's not as game as Bo, but Stonehill<br> says he can jump a four-rail fence!<br> You're too old and too fat<br> to be jumping horses!<br> Well, come to see<br> a fat old man some time.<br>
