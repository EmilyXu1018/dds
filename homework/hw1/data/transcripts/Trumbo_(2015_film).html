I don't give 'em<br> what they're after, they'll kill me.<br> Hold it, Rocco.<br> We don't fight these guys, sure, maybe you<br> get that<br> Shit.<br> Cut!<br> Damn it.<br> Props.<br> Sorry, sorry everyone<br> Goin' again, Eddie.<br> Sorry, Sam.<br> Sorry, everybody.<br> Of course, the one day the author's among<br> us.<br> "Among us."<br> Sure as hell ain't one of us.<br> What's my brilliant line, Trumbo?<br> Oh, got it right here.<br> Hold it now Rocco.<br> "If we don't fight these guys, sure, maybe<br> you get that long, happy life we all want."<br> So what've you got me fighting for then?<br> "Peace on Earth, good will toward men."<br> You can't do that, this is America.<br> All right. How about sex and money?<br> There you go, two things we all love.<br> None of your little sermons on citizenship.<br> All right, run again.<br> Mayer lined up the A Team, Sam Wood to shoot,<br> Dalton Trumbo for rewrites, so, fingers crossed...<br> I had no crew!<br> I couldn't work --<br> -- you wouldn't work, God forbid you cross<br> a picket line.<br> For set builders.<br> What do set builders have to do with writing?<br> What writers write, builders build. What they<br> build, you shoot.<br> Now, you make all the money you possibly can,<br> so do I, why shouldn't they?<br> And why can't we help them<br> Listen to you, the Swimming Pool Soviet.<br> Oh for God's sakes.<br> You won Sam.<br> The strike is over.<br> And you just might try being a gracious winner.<br> It's never over with you people -- strike,<br> after strike, after strike!<br> Y'know what?<br> I'm going on strike -- against people WHO<br> GO ON STRIKE!<br> And I won't cross your picket line, either.<br> Awe give me that Trumbo.<br> Sam, Sam, Sam, we've got to talk about those<br> scenes tomorrow, disaster, who the hell wrote<br> that crap?<br> But first, may I have this dance...?<br> Having fun?<br> Eternally.<br> Miss Hopper.<br> Dateline: Hollywood.<br> The offices of top columnist, Hedda Hopper.<br> Greetings from our film capital, where all<br> is sun and fun. Or is it?<br> You see the famous faces here?<br> Danny Kaye, Humphrey Bogart, his dishy bride,<br> Lauren Bacall, all of whom have declared solidarity<br> with film crews picketing for higher wages.<br> In walk-outs that quickly turned violent.<br> Because these strikes were in fact the work<br> of dangerous radicals.<br> Here we see actor Edward G. Robinson star<br> of Double Indemnity.<br> And this is writer Dalton Trumbo who is, like<br> many of those strikers -- and their supporters<br> -- a registered Communist.<br> Who exactly is behind these walk-outs... and<br> why?<br> Our elected leaders will find out.<br> Congressman J. Parnell Thomas and his House<br> Un-American Activities Committee.<br> Communism is not some faraway threat; its<br> most dangerous agents are here, controlling<br> the airwaves and movie screens, taking over<br> its employees and their unions.<br> They need to be identified as the enemies<br> they are.<br> Communists!<br> Their goal -- world domination!<br> The front line of a new kind of war.<br> A Cold War!<br> A conspiracy to corrupt democratic values<br> and bring about the overthrow of this nation.<br> Mitzi fell asleep.<br> Hey, that you in the newsreel...?<br> Yes, it was--<br> Traitor --<br> Oh, my God.<br> I'm all right, I'm all right.<br> No harm done, everybody okay?<br> Dad, are you a Communist?<br> I am.<br> Is it against the law?<br> It is not.<br> That lady with the big hat said you're a "dangerous<br> radical."<br> Are you?<br> Radical, maybe.<br> Dangerous, only to men who fling Cokes.<br> I love our country and it's a good government.<br> But anything good can be better, don't you<br> think?<br> Is Mom a Communist?<br> No. Am I?<br> Now, why don't we give you the official test.<br> Mom makes your favorite lunch...<br> Ham and cheese.<br> Ham and cheese.<br> ...and at school you see someone with no lunch<br> at all -- what do you do?<br> Share.<br> You don't tell them to just go get a job?<br> No.<br> You offer them a loan at six percent? Oh,<br> that's very clever<br> Dad.<br> Ahh, then just ignore them.<br> No.<br> Well, well.<br> You little Commie.<br> Trumbo, as usual, you only make sense to you.<br> Let 'em call you a Communist, me a Democrat<br> -- both legitimate parties, yours<br> is just meaner and duller but there's nothing<br> illegal about any of it.<br> Yet.<br> Hunter, tell your friend to dial down the<br> paranoia and have a drink.<br> I don't think he's being paranoid enough.<br> Not you, too.<br> You're out of ice now.<br> I have taken the liberty of drawing up a pamphlet.<br> Subject: "Congress Unaware of Little Thing<br> Called First Amendment."<br> They're aware of it they just don't give a<br> shit.<br> All they care about is this nice, new war<br> of theirs -- these guys love war --<br> and this is a great one, vague and it's scary,<br> and it's expensive. Anybody for<br> it's a hero, anybody against it is a traitor.<br> Exactly, thank you.<br> And if you think this is about movies you're<br> an idiot.<br> Which is why I'm going to go have a chat with<br> the other side.<br> You don't mean the Alliance, do you?<br> I do.<br> Are you out of your mind -- ?<br> Eddie, they're all actors, writers, directors,<br> just like us --<br> They're Nazis, they're just too cheap to buy<br> the uniforms --<br> They invited Congress out here --<br> And are they all Sam Woods and Hedda Hoppers?<br> Please, let's not demonize people we don't<br> really know.<br> I say we go for it.<br> You know who you're gonna be talkin' to there,<br> don't ya?<br> Ladies and gentlemen, Mr John Wayne.<br> I wanna say one thing about a place I love.<br> No, not Hollywood...<br> ...I like Hollywood...<br> ...but I love America!<br> And when we talk about America I'm talking<br> about freedom!<br> The kinda freedom we just fought a world war<br> to save!<br> You wanna be a Communist, go be a Communist...<br> but some friends of mine in Washington think<br> you got some questions to answer!<br> I never knew he was this good.<br> Still wanna be a Commie?<br> 'Cause he's not acting, that's him.<br> Be a Commie!<br> In Russia!<br> But off ya go 'n' enjoy the Bolshoi Ballet!<br> Excuse me sir would you like to read about<br> the first amendment?<br> Sir a little education about your rights.<br> Sir.<br> A little light reading.<br> Travels well.<br> Well, thank you sir.<br> Do svidaniya.<br> This is a nightmare.<br> If it were, I'd be in bed.<br> Dalton?<br> Oh, Hedda, Good evening to you.<br> Eddie, darling.<br> Hedda.<br> New hat?<br> Daily, dear, daily.<br> Been to the movies lately Dalton?<br> Duke!<br> Now, wasn't he magnificent?<br> Just sayin' what needs sayin'.<br> Hiya, Eddie.<br> Duke.<br> I hear you 'n' your pals got a "pamphlet."<br> Any takers?<br> Not yet...<br> Would you like one sir?<br> We're Communists.<br> He's a writer.<br> Ya won't get any takers.<br> Not here anyway.<br> Oh, why's that?<br> All it says is that, Congress has no right<br> to investigate how we vote, where<br> we pray, what we think, say or how we make<br> movies.<br> Hello, I'm Dalton Trumbo.<br> Congress has the right to go after anything<br> they think is a threat.<br> Well that's where we disagree.<br> That's the point -- we both have the right<br> to be wrong.<br> You wanna talk about rights, first show me<br> whose side you're on.<br> Russia's no friend, not anymore. You better<br> wake up.<br> 'Cause it's a new day.<br> A new day.<br> And?<br> Maybe it's not for your kind.<br> My kind, what kind is that?<br> The kind that has no idea why we just won<br> a war.<br> Just curious. That's the second time you've<br> mentioned that. I was a war correspondent<br> in Okinawa --<br> -- Hedda's son was stationed in the Philippines<br> --<br> -- Eddie was in Europe with the Office of<br> War Information --<br> -- where did you serve again?<br> You tryin' to say something?<br> No, Duke, he wasn't --<br> Stay out of it, Eddie --<br> If you're gonna talk about World War Two as<br> if you personally won it, let's be<br> clear where you were stationed -- on a film<br> set, shooting blanks, wearing<br> makeup and if you're going to hit me, I'd<br> like to take off my glasses.<br> Duke, let's get outta here...<br> Thank you, Dalton.<br> My next column just wrote itself.<br> It's a good thing you didn't want to demonize<br> anybody or that could've been awkward.<br> Manny wouldn't say amorous.<br> Two packs please.<br> Thank you.<br> Good God.<br> She's everywhere.<br> Your next deal's gonna make you the highest-paid<br> writer in Hollywood, which'll make you the<br> highest-paid writer in the world.<br> You earned it.<br> You don't just write happy endings, you actually<br> believe them.<br> That's what the people pay to see, that's<br> why you belong here at MGM, right, L.B.?<br> Look, I hate to make the wooing too easy for<br> you but: Where do I sign?<br> Just one thing.<br> If you're going to work for me...<br> ...I never, ever want to see anything like<br> this again.<br> You won't.<br> I promise.<br> -Good.<br> Just stop reading Hedda Hopper.<br> So what'd L.B. say then?<br> Jesus, don't, I haven't eaten since.<br> My job's not hard enough?<br> Your job's not hard at all.<br> You think getting Mayer to sign you after<br> those headlines was easy?<br> You have a record-breaking, three- year contract<br> -- to make shit up. You're welcome.<br> C'mon, Mom!<br> She really can!<br> Ask her!<br> Cleo?<br> Is this true?<br> Watch this.<br> Trumbo, no...<br> Of course you realize this means war.<br> I... had a very unusual mother.<br> Translation: "Stage Mother."<br> The misspent youth of a child acrobat.<br> My God, how long were you in show business?<br> Till I was 15.<br> But it was more "show-forced-labor."<br> Mr. Dalton Trumbo?<br> Yes.<br> See you in Washington.<br> Enjoy your picnic. Let's go boys.<br> Nineteen subpoenas have been issued to those<br> we believe have knowledge of the ongoing Communist<br> threat in Hollywood.<br> Uh, what kind of threat is that?<br> A conspiracy to corrupt democratic values<br> and bring about the overthrow of this nation.<br> Using... movies.<br> Any movie in particular or...?<br> Movies are the most powerful form of influence<br> ever created and they are<br> infested with hidden traitors...<br> The House Un-American Activities Committee<br> has been formed to investigate<br> alleged Communists working in Hollywood. The<br> newsreel cameras and an army of<br> newspaper men are on hand.<br> Mr. Reagan, has it been reported to you that<br> certain members of the screen<br> actors guild were Communists?<br> There has been a small group more or less<br> following the tactics that we<br> associate with the Communist party.<br> And would you refer to them as a disrupting<br> influence?<br> I would say that at times they have attempted<br> to be a disrupting influence<br> Do you believe that the motion picture industry<br> is doing everything it can to rid itself of<br> subversive, Un-American influences?<br> No!<br> The Communists are everywhere! They report<br> directly to Moscow!<br> On numerous occasions Communist agitators<br> have tried hard to steer us into<br> the red river.<br> We've got a little too much weight for that.<br> Will you name a few of these agitators?<br> Irving Bischel, Edward Dmytryk, Frank Tuttle.<br> If I had my way about it they'd all be sent<br> back to Russia or some other<br> unpleasant place.<br> We get our chance to testify in three days<br> What we're about to do won't make us too popular.<br> Okay, we get slandered, and then what?<br> You answer every question they ask, in your<br> own way.<br> So don't tell 'em shit.<br> Beautifully put.<br> Well, you know what they call that?<br> Yes, In all likelihood we'll be cited for<br> Contempt of Congress.<br> There will be a trial.<br> What am I missing here, all I'm hearing is<br> jail.<br> Not necessarily.<br> -- in a lower court, yes, we'll likely lose<br> but on appeal it'll work.<br> The Supreme Court is a five to four liberal<br> majority. They think this<br> Committee's unconstitutional, they want it<br> killed.<br> Sounds great.<br> And I'm out.<br> Look, I can't afford this stuff you guys are<br> talkin' about<br> ...

Nice to see you again<br> Buddy.<br> I hear your new script's in trouble.<br> Maybe you should hire Dalton, he used to be<br> pretty good... and price-wise he'd be bargain<br> basement.<br> Not that you'd ever do it.<br> Not after Buddy named names.<br> Oh, you didn't know?<br> Word was, he'd hired someone he shouldn't<br> have.<br> So he got subpoenaed, he had to testify.<br> Closed session, no press.<br> Makes it easier.<br> So he named you, of course.<br> Now he's been cleared.<br> Gets to go make his movie.<br> In a way, thanks to you.<br> Drink Buddy?<br> You look as if you need one.<br> Can you believe it?<br> Democrats.<br> Voting for segregation.<br> Southern Dixiecrats.<br> They started a petition for total integration.<br> There it is.<br> I already have over a thousand signatures.<br> I'd be happy to make it a thousand and one.<br> This is the new draft that needs to be delivered<br> to Hymie King in Agoura.<br> Wait, Agoura, I thought the Kings were in<br> Hollywood.<br> No, these are the rewrites, that are to be<br> shot tonight, Hymie needs them on<br> set, right away.<br> Agoura's forty miles.<br> Yes, I'm sure Chris knows that by now.<br> Well, he can't --<br> -- I'm sorry?<br> He has a date.<br> He's taking her to a movie.<br> Well, all right, then Nikola, you'll deliver<br> the draft.<br> I have a protest.<br> Since when do protests have hard start times<br> -- ?<br> I'll take it --<br> Nicola.<br> Will do it.<br> I said, I can't --<br> Young lady, you will --<br> -- this is important --<br> -- so is this --<br> This is important to me -- the date's important<br> to Chris -- so figure something else out --<br> Move on, he needs those now.<br> She hasn't been gone that long, it's not that<br> late.<br> This is a<br> blatant attempt to manipulate worry.<br> Do you know when I realized that I had to<br> leave Hal?<br> Hal, Hal who?<br> My first husband, Hal.<br> Jesus Take The Wheel...<br> It was my wedding night.<br> My first wedding night.<br> With Hal.<br> If we're going to travel back in time to that<br> unholy coupling, I have a medical obligation<br> to drink.<br> I saw this was not a man I could have children<br> with.<br> He'd bully me, them and we'd end up like every<br> miserable family since forever.<br> But you, I knew you would never be like that.<br> Whatever happened out there, all that'd matter,<br> really matter, was us.<br> All that matters is us --<br> No, not anymore, you have no idea what you<br> could lose --<br> Oh, please, my career, the first amendment,<br> our country?<br> Am I missing anything?<br> Us, you're losing us.<br> Since prison, you don't talk or ask, you just<br> snap and bark -- I keep waiting for you to<br> start pounding the dinner table with a gavel<br> --<br> So in addition to being a pariah out in the<br> world, I also have the supreme joy of battling<br> insurrection --<br> -- battling, "insurrection" --<br> -- in my own home, where these ten fingers<br> literally, clothe and feed and shelter us<br> --<br> This isn't just happening to you.<br> We all hurt!<br> Niki, me, your friends --<br> Friends, what friends?<br> Who the hell has the luxury of "friends"?<br> I've got allies and enemies, there's no room<br> for anything else!<br> We know.<br> Good, then this discussion ends.<br> This isn't a discussion, it's a fight.<br> I will not let our children be raised by a<br> bully.<br> I didn't want to fight in front of my friends<br> --<br> -- but I'm not going home.<br> -- I didn't come here to fight --<br> You know your mother is a quiet person.<br> Normally.<br> The effect of which is that she can actually<br> make me hear myself.<br> It's extraordinary and lately, it's not a<br> sound I like much.<br> Mostly because what I hear is just how, how<br> afraid I am.<br> Afraid that I'm scarring you, all of you...<br> and what if it's all for nothing?<br> What then?<br> Well, so I fight.<br> It's all I know how to do anymore, just...<br> rage... at anyone who gets in my way.<br> But you have never been in my way,<br> Nikola, not once...<br> It's crazy how mad you make me, since all<br> I ever wanted was to be just like you...<br> Well, I'm afraid to say that you've succeeded.<br> We know.<br> Okay?<br> It's a small town and the gossip's always<br> true.<br> Fire Dalton Trumbo and the rest of 'em or<br> you got pickets, headlines and boycotts.<br> We will put you right out of business.<br> We...?<br> The Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation<br> of American Ideals.

Who gets the thing<br> if it wins?<br> Well, maybe it won't.<br> I mean, it's not that good.<br> No offense.<br> None taken.<br> And now I'd like to say two of the most beautiful<br> words in the motion picture<br> industry. Deborah Kerr.<br> The nominations of best motion picture story<br> are.<br> Robert Rich for The Brave One.<br> Leo Katcher for The Eddy Duchin Story.<br> Jean-Paul Sartre for The Proud and the Beautiful.<br> And Cesare Zavattini for Umberto D.<br> The envelope please.<br> The Brave One!<br> Robert Rich!<br> Mr. Jessie Lasky Jr., vice president of the<br> Screen Writers branch of the Writers Guild,<br> will accept the award for Mr. Rich.<br> On behalf of Robert Rich and his beautiful<br> story, thank you very much.<br> So weird.<br> We can't find Mr. Rich anywhere, he apparently<br> doesn't --<br> Who the hell is Robert Rich?<br> I gotta go.<br> It had better not be who they say.<br> Mr. Trumbo, are you Robert Rich? Did you write<br> The Brave One?<br> Well, you see, its' my policy not to claim<br> credit for any one movie.<br> That way, it's possible that I had something<br> to do with all of them.<br> Except the stinkers, which were all written<br> by my enemies.<br> What's your position on the blacklist?<br> Well, on it.<br> Along with thousands of others.<br> Are you using this Robert Rich controversy<br> to try and end it?<br> You see, the Brave One is a nice little picture.<br> And, if rumors of my involvement can help<br> sell tickets, then good.<br> And if the strange circumstances of its authorship<br> raised a few questions,<br> well even better.<br> Trumbo?<br> Yes.<br> Phone for you<br> Well who is it?<br> Some crazy guy says he's Kirk Douglas.<br> Really?<br> Well thank you Nikola.<br> Niki?<br> Kirk.<br> Kirk.<br> Dalton.<br> My apologies.<br> We've had more than our share of crank calls<br> lately.<br> I can't imagine.<br> Please have a seat.<br> May I get you a drink?<br> No, no thank you.<br> All right.<br> So.<br> I'm doing a new picture.<br> And I just got the script.<br> Must be seven hours of entertainment there.<br> And not a single page is entertaining.<br> But there's a good story in there, somewhere.<br> About one man...<br> ...who tried to take on the whole world.<br> Well, you've got me so far.<br> He was a slave who led a revolt against the<br> Roman Empire...<br> And what's the title?<br> Spartacus.<br> ...no, no, no I can't tell you what I'm working<br> on now except to say, the blacklist is alive<br> and well and so is the black market.<br> Well, yes, you can quote me on that.<br> Seeing my name in the papers drives certain<br> people out of their minds...<br> Kirk, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine,<br> Bob Stripling...<br> ...House Un-American Activities Committee.<br> Douglas?<br> Mr. Stripling.<br> Drink.<br> No, thank you.<br> You said it was important...<br> Only if you hired Dalton Trumbo.<br> Who I hire is my business.<br> No, Mr. Douglas.<br> It's ours.<br> Why?<br> Because we have to keep this country safe.<br> And how're you doing that?<br> Well why don't I show you by putting you on<br> the stand?<br> Hedda, is your friend trying to scare me?<br> He's just trying to show you the way things<br> are.<br> Maybe I don't like the way things are.<br> Kirk we've known each other a long time.<br> Since when did you become such a bastard?<br> I was always a bastard.<br> You just never noticed.<br> Yes.<br> I wish to see the man who wrote this.<br> Please come in.<br> I am Otto Preminger.<br> The director.<br> Forgive me, I just finished work a few hours<br> ago.<br> A copy of which I've read.<br> But I just had that delivered this morning.<br> I am Otto Preminger.<br> The director.<br> Please.<br> Oh yes, my youngest believes I can end the<br> suffering of all broken birds.<br> As can I.<br> With a broiler.<br> Are your duties completed for Mr. Kirk Douglas?<br> No, but I do have two weeks off for Christmas...<br> During which time you will work with me.<br> Will I.<br> If you are as intelligent as your writing...<br> and as greedy as your reputation.<br> It is an adaptation of the novel Exodus.<br> You've read it?<br> No.<br> A colossal best-seller.<br> Very nearly a perfect piece of shit. But --<br> -- there's a good story in there, somewhere.<br> I have no idea.<br> But I have Paul Newman.<br> We have spoken.<br> He is a little reticent but I believe at the<br> right price.<br> So you're doing it?<br> I think it's the only way to get him to leave.<br> Poor Mr. Preminger... thinks he's the cat<br> and you're the mouse...<br> Oh, look at that.<br> Absolutely perfect.<br> What is this, Santa?<br> Oh, just a little something for Mrs. Claus.<br> I'll open it later.<br> You know Christmas is over?<br> Well? Did you read my new scenes?<br> Dreadful.<br> Keep up this level of work, and I will see<br> to it your name is on my movie.<br> To take the blame.<br> There you go.<br> Oh hello, hi Sammy.<br> Do you know Kirk Douglas gave me his bird?<br> It's a distraction.<br> No, not at all.<br> I named him Sam Jackson.<br> He wrote Spartacus.<br> Well?<br> Better.<br> Thank God.<br> But.<br> It simply... lacks genius.<br> Otto.<br> If every scene is brilliant, your movie is<br> going to be utterly monotonous.<br> I tell you what.<br> You write every scene brilliantly. And I will<br> direct unevenly.<br> What is it dear?<br> Thank you.<br> Hello Kirk. Merry Christmas.<br> Thank you Ritchie.<br> Otto.<br> How are you?<br> I'm very well.<br> I, uh, didn't mean to interrupt --<br> No, no, not at all.<br> Otto would you mind if we had a little chat?<br> It won't be a second.<br> I sort of feel like I walked in on my wife.<br> Do you love him?<br> Oh, it's far more lurid than that. He's paying<br> me for my services.<br> So am I.<br> And you'll get them again, January second,<br> as promised.<br> I just need you a few days on some the new<br> scenes.<br> Of course, but not until the second...<br> I wouldn't ask but I've never had a director<br> who's a bigger pain in my ass than Stanley<br> Kubrick.<br> Worst part is, he's right.<br> Well, I wouldn't refuse, but...<br> Well, I really...<br> This should remain between us.<br> Of course.<br> Well, Preminger has declared that... well,<br> what he said was, "You keep up this<br> level of work and I'll see to it your name<br> is on my movie."<br> Really.<br> Those were his exact words.<br> Be in touch.<br> Very well.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> I suppose he wants you back?<br> No, no.<br> He just stopped by to talk about, ah, a screen<br> credit.<br> On Spartacus?<br> Well, I really shouldn't have said anything.<br> You understand.<br> Five minutes, back in five minutes everybody.<br> Kirk, Hedda Hopper just told me the American<br> Legion is going to boycott us<br> unless you get rid of Trumbo.<br> Ed, he's not done with the script, his name'll<br> never be on the thing, what's anybody boycotting?<br> Kirk, just, just, just a second please.<br> Please just give me five seconds.<br> Please listen.<br> Twenty-million Americans are saying loud and<br> clear they will never buy a ticket to our<br> movie unless you fire one writer.<br> Here's fifty.<br> Pick one.<br> Mind if I stick my nose in?<br> Please.<br> He knows.<br> He sees Kirk Douglas coming in and out of<br> here.<br> And Otto Preminger and his Rolls.<br> He's an idiot, but he's not stupid.<br> Has he called the FBI?<br> Congress?<br> No.<br> Because everything they can do, they've already<br> done.<br> That Oscar belongs to you.<br> Get it.<br> My God, you're nothing like me.<br> You're worse.<br> For the record, you're Robert Rich.<br> I am.<br> I've been through the whole list Ed, they're<br> all hacks.<br> And you wrote The Brave One.<br> I did.<br> Ed, let me call you back.<br> Why come forward now?<br> Well, as someone who's been thoroughly investigated<br> by the House Un-American Activities Committee,<br> I started wondering...<br> ...why hasn't anyone taken a good, long look<br> at them?<br> And their work in the movie industry?<br> You see, they were convened to uncover enemy<br> agents, expose Communist conspiracies and<br> write anti-sedition laws.<br> Well, here we are, thousands of hours and<br> millions of dollars later: agents uncovered<br> -- zero; conspiracies exposed -- zero; laws<br> written -- zero.<br> You see, all they do is deny people the right<br> to work and they can't even get that right.<br> Academy Awards --<br> -- two.<br> And how does that feel?<br> To have so undermined the blacklist it's almost<br> a joke?<br> A joke.<br> I know the blacklist that produced Robert<br> Rich, I've seen its horror, cruelty and hideous<br> waste of life as I've marched in the long<br> line of its anonymous.<br> And I can not invent one more witticism about<br> Robert Rich or the Oscar he can't claim...<br> because that small, worthless, golden statue<br> is covered with the blood of my friends.<br> I'll get it.<br> Hello.<br> Oh, hello Otto.<br> I've read your latest draft.<br> What do you think?<br> My answer is on the front page of today's<br> New York Times.<br> You hated it that much.<br> Merry Christmas, Mr. Trumbo.<br> Ed, have a seat.<br> But why doesn't he kill him?<br> Kill him!<br> Kill him!<br> Kill him you imbecile!<br> Great, great.<br> Morty, have them put up the scene with Varinia<br> and Crassus.<br> Thank you.<br> Listen, Kirk.<br> One Second.<br> Warren, I'd like you to put out a press release,<br> the screen...<br> ...one second Warren.<br> What do you remember when you think about<br> Spartacus?<br> He was a man who began all alone.<br> Like an animal.<br> Yet on the day he died, thousands and thousands<br> would have gladly died in his<br> place.<br> What was he?<br> Was he a god?<br> He wasn't a god, he was a simple man, a slave.<br> I loved him.<br> Warren, the press release will say the screenplay<br> for Spartacus was written by Dalton Trumbo.<br> Thank you.<br> Kirk, If you won't get rid of Trumbo, I will.<br> And right after I quit, you can re-shoot all<br> my scenes.<br> See, Ed, for better or worse... I am Spartacus.<br> There's a picture coming out. It's called<br> Spartacus. It's starring Kirk Douglas.<br> And it is written by Dalton Trumbo.<br> If there's some other writer's name on it,<br> don't believe it.<br> We're onto them!<br> Yes.<br> Now listen Ed, we'll picket every theater<br> that movie is in unless you pull the<br> prints, tonight, and get that traitor's name<br> off it.<br> Hedda, you can't put me in this position,<br> that's expensive and pointless.<br> Then kiss your movie, your studio and your<br> miserable ass goodbye!<br> Hollywood turns out in force to hail UI's<br> new film spectacle, Spartacus on the<br> premier of the twelve million dollar picture<br> in the film colony.<br> The protesters also showed up to remind everyone<br> of the political controversy<br> surrounding the making of this film.<br> Cleo?<br> What is it?<br> It's over, isn't it.<br> Yes.<br> And we made it...<br> Yes.<br> President Kennedy enjoyed a rare evening off,<br> attending the new Kirk Douglas film, Spartacus.<br> Mr. President, Mr. President, it's a very<br> controversial film, what did you think?<br> It's a, ah, fine picture and...<br> ...I think it's going to be a big hit.<br> The implication of Kennedy's approval of this<br> film are wide-ranging.<br> The novel was written by a former Communist.<br> The screenplay was adapted by a former Communist.<br> And this signifies the blacklist may be over<br> as Kirk Douglas and Otto<br> Preminger have openly hired and credited blacklisted<br> writers. This is a clear<br> repudiation of the decades long fight by anti-Communists<br> to punish...<br> ...this next award is for the member who has<br> advanced the literature of motion pictures.<br> Occasionally there appears among us a person<br> whose virtues are so manifest,<br> who so subordinates his own ego to the concerns<br> of others, who lives in such<br> harmony with all the standards of the community<br> that he is revered and loved<br> by everyone. Such a man, Dalton Trumbo is<br> not.<br> It gives me great pleasure to present The<br> Writers' Guild of America Laurel Award to<br> Dalton Trumbo.<br> Thank you, thank you very much.<br> Thank you, thank you very much ladies and<br> gentlemen.<br> Often, when I stand before the film community,<br> there is an elephant in the room -- me.<br> And I, I thought I might address that.<br> The blacklist was a time of evil.<br> And no one who survived it came through untouched<br> by evil.<br> Caught in a situation that had passed beyond<br> the control of mere individuals,<br> each person reacted as his nature his needs<br> his convictions and his particular<br> circumstances compelled him to.<br> It was a time of fear and no one was exempt.<br> Scores of people lost their homes. Their families<br> disintegrated, they lost.<br> And some, some<br> even lost their lives.<br> But when you look back upon that dark time<br> as I think you should every now and<br> then. It will do you no good to search for<br> heroes or villains. There weren't<br> any. There were only victims, victims because<br> each of us felt compelled to say<br> or do things that we otherwise would not.<br> To deliver or receive wounds we truly did<br> not wish to exchange.<br> I look out to my family sitting there and<br> I realize what I've put them<br> through and it's unfair.<br> My wife who somehow kept it all together amazes<br> me.<br> And so what I say here tonight is not intended<br> to be hurtful to anyone.<br> It is intended to heal a hurt.<br> To repair the wounds which for years have<br> been inflicted upon each other and<br> most egregiously upon ourselves.<br> Thank you. Thank you kindly.<br> There ain't nothin'<br> I can do<br> or nothin' I can say<br> That folks don't<br> criticize me<br> but I'm going to do<br> Just as I want to<br> anyway<br> And don't care<br> just what people say<br> If I<br> should take a notion,<br> to jump into the ocean<br> Ain't nobody's<br> business if I do<br> If you receive the Oscar, what do you intend<br> to do with it?<br> I had a, I had a daughter,<br> thirteen years<br> old.<br> I've been blacklisted since she was three.<br> She's known the title of every motion picture<br> I've written in this study and<br> she's kept that title secret.<br> A soldier.<br> When her, when her friends say to her as children do<br> "my father does so and<br> so, what does your father do"<br> this, this confronted her<br> with a very real problem<br> It confronts her with the problem<br> and has since she was three<br> who her father really is and<br> what her father really does.<br> I uh, think, I will give this Oscar if I get it<br> to that girl<br> I, I think I will tell her<br> well here is one secret you no<br> longer need to be burdened with.<br> I'll tell her we have our names back again.<br>
