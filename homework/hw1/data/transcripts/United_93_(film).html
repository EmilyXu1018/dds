Tony.<br> Stand by one second.<br> Yesterday, we had<br> two ground delay programs.<br> One at Atlanta<br> and one at O'Hare.<br> And we had 850<br> aircraft delayed.<br> Hit a 56-minute average<br> and a very modest<br> Benny, that is like, $2,000<br> a minute we are talking about.<br> You are into<br> a hole already for...<br> No, no, no.<br> ... 90 million bucks, Ben.<br> They're not even my delays.<br> I started today.<br> Ben, we need you<br> on the floor.<br> We're getting more information<br> on that American 11.<br> Oh, all right.

The ops<br> manager of Boston Center.<br> Hi, this is Ben Sliney.<br> Boston thought it may<br> have been a... They heard<br> some kind of oddball Yes.<br> transmission.<br> Right.<br> So she called the company,<br> she said their airplane<br> was being hijacked...<br> All right.<br> Has he changed altitude?<br> ...don't know if it's a person<br> or people who've been stabbed.<br> All right.<br> All right, we're pulling<br> it up now, and, listen,<br> if you get any further information on<br> the track or the altitude, let me know.<br> All right.

I don't know.<br> I'll tell you what, that is<br> not a small plane. No way.<br> It's huge.<br> A Cessna would have bounced off<br> that. Look at the size of that hole!<br> Look at all them<br> people sitting...<br> I got a bad feeling about<br> this. I'll tell you right now.<br> Is that American 11? Is<br> that who they were tracking?<br> Nobody's telling us anything.<br> No info. I have no info.<br> Well, which way are we looking<br> here? If we're looking...<br> It looks like the sun's on that side<br> of the building, so we're looking north.<br> He came from our left.<br> He had to come from the west.<br> That aircraft came in from<br> the west into that building.<br> Who could it be?<br> Now where's American 11?<br> You know what I want you to<br> do? Get in touch with the NYPD.<br> See if they have any information on<br> what caused that in the Trade Center.<br> Look at the size<br> of that explosion.<br> ...Sean, you're on the air right<br> now. What can you tell us about...<br> And, folks, Captain Dahl.<br> We've reached our cruising<br> altitude of 35,000 feet<br> and I'm going ahead and turn<br> the "Fasten Seat Belts" sign off.<br> That is your signal you are<br> safe to move about the cabin.<br> We got<br> the seatbelt sign off.<br> However, when you<br> are in your seats<br> I'll ask you to keep your<br> seatbelts loosely fastened,<br> as you never know when we'll get<br> some bumps we're not expecting.<br> Our flying time today again<br> is 5 hours and 25 minutes,<br> and in spite of that short<br> delay back there in Newark<br> I'm still projecting an on-time<br> arrival in San Francisco.<br> I'll update you on the weather<br> as we get a little closer.<br> In the interim now, I'll<br> ask you to sit back and enjoy<br> the outstanding service<br> of our fine flight attendants.<br> If there's anything we in the cockpit<br> can do to make your ride more enjoyable,<br> please don't hesitate to ask.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey, can I get<br> a copy of the manifest?<br> Oh, sure.<br> Thanks.<br> Here you go.<br> I appreciate it.<br> Yeah, no problem.<br> Looks pretty good, huh?<br> I love these light loads.<br> I do, too.<br> I knew you were gonna<br> say that, so I've planned.<br> We've got...<br> We have reservations there.<br> And there.<br> Fedex 7852, we heard it was a small<br> plane that hit the World Trade Center.<br> That's the last that we heard.

We've given you people...<br> Listen, I know it's not your job to do<br> this, but you've gotta do what you can.<br> We gotta get jets on every one<br> of those aircraft on that board.<br> Are you in direct contact with the<br> Pentagon or are you talking to some liaison?<br> No, no, no,<br> I'm talking to them.<br> They understand the gravity of the situation.<br> I'll give you the best update I can...<br> No, I need action is<br> what I need.

I don't<br> think it's a hijack.<br> He took a turn of a 330<br> heading. It doesn't matter.<br> They said he was hijacked.<br> They placed a phone call.<br> Keep working him, all<br> right? I'm just telling you.<br> I don't know if we have<br> one or two,<br> but I know he is descending<br> on his own without a clearance.<br> Wait a minute. Delta.<br> What about Delta?<br> Delta's answering. Delta's fine so far.<br> The only one I don't have is the United 93.<br> He's not responding,<br> and he is...<br> He was descending on his own.<br> He appears to be climbing now.<br> Cleveland just called.<br> There's a United 93,<br> the controller heard screams<br> coming from the cockpit.<br> Sounds like the American 11. Jesus.<br> This is starting to look<br> like a pattern.<br> Where was that aircraft<br> last known? Do you know?<br> Which way is he heading?<br> We gotta get track information<br> on these guys.<br> He was a Newark-to-San Francisco<br> flight. He's still on course.<br> All right, get all the<br> adjacent centers. Notify them.<br> In every direction.<br> And keep me advised<br> on flight 93.<br> Hey, Ben? Ben?

What did she say?<br> American 77 coming<br> out of Dulles<br> heading west, going to LAX.<br> Light me up every track, guys.<br> What do you got?<br> I don't know how many more there could<br> be in the air, sir, but the point is this.<br> We've gotta get them before<br> they're within range of Washington.<br> We gotta get them<br> before they're 60 miles,<br> not gonna have a play.<br> We're not gonna be able<br> to protect the Capitol.<br> Come on. Come on, guys.<br> Answer it, please, answer.<br> Oh, my God, there he<br> is. He's on the floor.<br> We need something<br> to bandage him with.<br> Anybody a doctor?<br> Medic?<br> She's an EMT.<br> I keep trying to call the<br> cockpit.

Ident, please.<br> Yes, I did, 797, and we couldn't<br> tell what it was, either.<br> Okay. United 93, Cleveland.<br> If you hear the Center, ident.<br> I got you.<br> Hi, my name is Sandy Bradshaw.<br> I'm on United flight 93<br> from Newark to San Francisco.<br> The airplane has been hijacked<br> by three guys with knives.<br> One of them's got, like, a<br> bomb strapped around his waist.<br> How many did you guys see? Three.<br> She thinks there were three. You<br> were sitting in first class, right?<br> They said there were...<br> They saw three.<br> No, they stabbed<br> a first class passenger.<br> Thank you.<br> Did they answer?<br> What did they say? They<br> couldn't tell me anything.<br> They didn't tell you<br> anything at all?<br> It was just the maintenance<br> department.<br> I got through to United. I got<br> through on the maintenance line.<br> I told them that the plane was hijacked.<br> I mean, I don't know what else to say.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> He didn't tell us anything!<br> He's a maintenance guy!<br> No, no, no! You back!<br> You back! You back!<br> Okay.<br> Sit! You!<br> Ziad!<br> ...you heard that also?<br> Yes, sir. Twice.<br> Roger. We heard that also. Just wanted<br> to confirm it wasn't from interference.<br> Victor, 956.<br> Victor, 956, go.<br> I wanted to answer your call.<br> We did hear that yelling, too.<br> Copy that.<br> I think we're turning.<br> Wait. We're turning.<br> Are we turning?<br> That means it's all right. It's okay...<br> We're gonna<br> go back to the airport.<br> They're going to ask for ransom. What?<br> I hope so.<br> In 1977 in Mogadishu, they<br> asked, you know, for money.<br> They will ask for ransom.<br> They will let us go.<br> We're going back<br> to the airport, all right?<br> We're going back<br> to the airport.<br> They're trained to deal<br> with this situation. Okay?<br> And they'll get us down on<br> the ground, all right? Okay?<br> I'm a pilot. I've been flying<br> all my life. But it's... I just...<br> What?<br> Something's wrong here.<br> We're okay.<br> Anybody know<br> where 77 is?<br> Cleveland Center was the<br> last one to talk to United 93.<br> Cleveland Center is the last<br> one who spoke to United 93.<br> But what about the military<br> response on this?<br> I'm talking to them now. I'm letting<br> them know where we are with this.<br> Listen, you got<br> to get somebody...<br> Where are they when<br> we need them?<br> ...down the hallway<br> to talk to them.<br> They are supposed to be<br> liaisoning with the military.<br> And I've got this colonel here, he's<br> not giving me the answers I need.<br> We're giving you the best we can,<br> sir. The best information I've got.<br> We're trying to get this<br> CAP established over New York.<br> I don't give a shit<br> about the CAP!<br> Listen to me. I've got<br> a board full of planes.<br> American 77's missing! United<br> Where are those fighter<br> jets? Are they...<br> You've got to get them into position<br> to do something about these aircraft.<br> We've got Selfridge on<br> the command post right now.<br> They've got two jets that<br> can fly from Alpena right now.<br> Get them on frequency. Hand<br> them off to that. Copy that.<br> What do you got, Foxy?<br> What do you got?<br> We got two F-16s<br> out of Selfridge,<br> Chevy flight, airborne,<br> coming to our freq now.<br> They're unarmed, but that's<br> all we've got. Copy that.<br> We're gonna need more support<br> and I've got to know, sir.<br> When they get there,<br> what can they do?<br> ...for a real world<br> military mission.<br> I understand it's<br> a commercial airliner, sir.<br> There will be casualties.<br> But what...<br> Think about what happens<br> if they hit the ground.<br> Think of what...<br> If they hit the Capitol, sir.<br> Go ahead, MCC.<br> Go ahead, go ahead.<br> We got two F-16s coming out of<br> Selfridge, but they're unarmed.<br> But how many more are out<br> there? That's the question.<br> We've got a report of at least<br> one more. May we engage?<br> I think<br> we shouldn't provoke them.<br> Just do what they want.<br> And then they'll land and let<br> us go and let the authorities...<br> Shouldn't somebody<br> try to talk to them?<br> the police, they'll<br> take care of them.<br> Give them<br> what they want.<br> Maybe we can<br> negotiate with them.<br> Quiet.<br> Just listen to me, sweetie, I<br> want you to call the authorities...<br> I'm calling from the Airfone.<br> You believe me,<br> don't you, Mom?<br> Did he stab him?<br> We got to go up there.<br> Just take us back<br> to the airport...<br> It's all right.<br> It's just us.<br> Let us see the passenger.<br> Just the passenger.<br> Richard, it's Jeremy.<br> I'm on the plane.<br> Let me talk to Lyzzie.<br> I'm on the plane.<br> Let me talk to Lyzzie.<br> Okay... You.<br> There's the passenger<br> he stabbed.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Okay. We're just<br> checking the passenger.<br> Did you contact<br> the pilot?<br> No, nobody said anything. We<br> can't get through to the cockpit.<br> We can't get through.<br> Okay, okay, okay.<br> Sir, okay. Okay, sir.<br> We're United flight 93. We've been<br> hijacked. There's three men with knives.<br> One of them has a bomb<br> strapped around his waist.<br> See if he has a pulse.<br> Is he breathing?<br> No, there's nothing.<br> There's nothing.<br> Ahmed.<br> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br> You've got to come<br> back here. What is it?<br> Come back here, come back here. What?<br> Oh, my God. Come on.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Stewardess, what's happening<br> up there? What is happening?<br> This is awful. Listen...<br> What is happening?<br> Just... We're going back to the<br> airport. Everything's gonna be fine.<br> Call the pilot.<br> Listen...<br> I don't know.<br> We're just finding out<br> what we can find out.<br> Get back here. Get back here.<br> Listen, listen, listen.<br> Listen! The pilots<br> are on the ground.<br> That was the pilots. They're on<br> the ground outside the cockpit.<br> They're on the floor.<br> She saw the pilot what?<br> What? What did she say?<br> The stewardess just said the<br> pilots aren't flying the plane.<br> She saw two bodies in front<br> of the cockpit on the floor.<br> They said they saw the pilot<br> and the co-pilot on the floor.<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> Flight United 93, call in.<br> MCC? Cleveland is saying that<br> Delta 1989 is considered a hijack.<br> They're considering<br> Delta 1989 a hijack.<br> We got Delta 1989, suspected<br> hijack, heading west.<br> Hit me up every track.<br> Did you copy that, sir?<br> Two planes?<br> Yes.<br> This is a second plane,<br> sir, coming in.<br> We got the one going west out of Boston,<br> and American 11 coming into Washington.<br> We still got the<br> Selfridge planes, sir.<br> Yes, sir. These guys<br> are not armed.<br> These fighters are not armed,<br> and we could ram...<br> If we ram them and eject, sir.<br> Do we have the authority, though?<br> Just spoke to Cleveland, they said that<br> US Air 2619 was headed towards Chicago.<br> They've just evacuated<br> the Sears Tower.<br> Jesus Christ!<br> United 93 is now<br> reported as NORDO.<br> No transponder, and now heading<br> eastbound, over Cleveland.<br> Let me know what<br> the hell is going on.<br> Six miles southwest<br> of the White House,<br> Boston Center's tracking<br> a primary moving fast.<br> Call Dulles tower.<br> Give me this again.<br> Give me this again.<br> Can you get me some<br> verification on that?<br> Sir, we have a VFR aircraft<br> southwest of Washington,<br> headed straight in now.<br> Sir, I got another flight<br> coming up south.<br> We have a plane headed<br> toward the Capitol.<br> I got an unidentified plane...<br> Yes. I need to know about<br> the ROE. Can we engage?<br> I want you to give me a 30-mile<br> circle around Reagan National.<br> Right now, you hit me up<br> every track on every aircraft.<br> Do we have any communication<br> with the President at all?<br> Where are the fighters?<br> How long can that take?<br> Air Force One's taken off.<br> They don't know anything about it.<br> They don't know where he's going.<br> Ben, they're evacuating<br> the White House!<br> All right, thanks, Carol.<br> They're evacuating it<br> right now.<br> Hey, are we gonna get<br> an intercept on this, though?<br> Okay. Good!<br> Go get yourself out of<br> your chair and go down...<br> There's no coordination between<br> what NORAD has and what we have.<br> You know where they're headed.<br> Just get the fighters<br> up there!<br> How about the Vice President, sir? Do<br> we have a location on the Vice President?<br> Well, then the Vice President<br> can make the call.<br> The Vice President can make<br> the call. We can engage.<br> Holy shit.<br> Yes, sir. Yes, sir. What's<br> the ETA on those Langley birds?<br> Foxy!<br> Spiders are airborne at 0930,<br> but they brought them out on an eastbound<br> heading rather than our northbound.<br> We're gonna get them turned<br> as soon as possible.<br> What the fuck? They're what?<br> They're heading east?<br> What the hell is wrong out there?<br> Why are those planes off-course?<br> It looks like they came out on a standard<br> scramble heading instead of the one I gave.<br> We're trying to get clearance<br> to turn them now.<br> How the fuck<br> did they get out there?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> What the fuck are they doing<br> out over the water?<br> I don't care, God damn it, if they break<br> windows, you turn them back over land!<br> Roll quad sevens. Turn<br> them towards Washington now.<br> Keep looking for him.<br> Keep looking for him.<br> It was a plane<br> that crashed at the Pentagon.<br> And the Pentagon<br> is being evacuated.<br> There is a large fire there,<br> and that is the smoke you see<br> in the shot that you<br> are looking at now.<br> Whether that fire is in the<br> building itself or outside,<br> we have not yet confirmed.<br> There is a fire on the Mall<br> in Washington.<br> The cause of the fire in the Mall in<br> Washington, we cannot yet tell you.<br> Oh, my gosh!<br> Foxy!<br> Sir.<br> I want those Langley birds<br> over Washington.<br> ...that two planes have crashed<br> into the World Trade Center.<br> Surveillance, I want you to hit<br> up tracks west of Cleveland...<br> Get back into position....<br> heading towards Las Vegas. Hit up.<br> Light me up every track<br> you've got. Let's go.<br> Let's go, let's go! Let's keep<br> going here! Let's keep working!<br> ID, what do you got?<br> All right,<br> he's off-course, he's<br> deviated, and we don't know why.<br> Confirmed.<br> Yes, sir. Yes, sir.<br> Confirmed hijackings.<br> That's the question.<br> What are we going to do now?<br> There's a lot of confusion here<br> at the Pentagon. It appears that<br> something hit the Pentagon on<br> the outside of the fifth corridor,<br> on the Army corridor.<br> Several Army officers I talked to<br> reported hearing a big explosion.<br> Listen, I'm not taking<br> any more chances.<br> We got stuff flying around<br> we have no control over.<br> And I don't want a board full of these planes<br> hitting every building on the East Coast.<br> This is a national emergency. Everyone<br> lands, regardless of destination.<br> That's gonna cost billions.<br> Just do it!<br> We have hundreds of<br> international flights coming in.<br> They're already in the air.<br> No. No, I don't want any more<br> international flights crossing the borders.<br> They'll have to go back<br> where they came from.<br> Nobody's coming into<br> the country from now on.<br> Everyone?<br> Everyone.<br> Shut off the East Coast. Shut off<br> all the internationals from Europe.<br> Shut off South America,<br> shut off the West Coast,<br> nothing over the top, either.<br> We're gonna call Canada<br> on that?<br> Yeah, Canada, too.<br> We're gonna shut down<br> the airspace.<br> No, I can't exempt anybody.<br> Nobody comes in,<br> and nobody takes off.<br> Land them all. Take a<br> moment. Think about this.<br> We're gonna shut down<br> the entire country right now?<br> That's right. Listen,<br> we're at war with someone,<br> and until we figure out what to<br> do about it, we're shutting down.<br> That's it. We're finished.<br> ...can handle<br> the emergency situation.<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Does anybody know<br> about the pilot yet?<br> They don't know.<br> No. They don't know.<br> What?<br> Two planes hit<br> the World Trade Center.<br> What?<br> In New York. The World<br> Trade Center.

They<br> are not gonna land this plane.<br> They are not gonna take us<br> back to the airport.<br> I don't think there's any<br> other option we have.<br> If we're gonna die,<br> we're gonna die.<br> They're flying us into<br> a building. We're gonna die.<br> We should not interfere<br> with them.<br> There's a lot of us,<br> but we gotta do something.<br> You see how low we are?<br> Is there a weapon?<br> Is there something we can use?<br> Go back.
