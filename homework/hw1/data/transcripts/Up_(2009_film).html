Big eyes.<br> Every night it<br> sneaks into my yard<br> and gobbles my poor azaleas.<br> I'm elderly and infirm.<br> I can't catch it.<br> - If only someone could help me...<br> - Me, me, I'll do it!<br> I don't know, it's<br> awfully crafty.<br> You'd have to clap<br> your hands three times<br> to lure it in.<br> I'll find her,<br> mr. Fredricksen!<br> I think its burrow<br> is two blocks down...<br> Two blocks down. Got it!<br> Snipe! Here, snipie, snipie...<br> Bring it back here<br> when you find it!<br> Snipe!<br> And stop.

Take all the<br> time you need, sir.<br> That's typical. He's probably going<br> to the bathroom for the 80th time.<br> You'd think he'd take<br> better care of his house.<br> So long, boys!<br> I'll send you a postcard<br> from Paradise Falls!<br> bSOUTH AMERICA/b<br> We are on our way, Ellie.<br> Hi, mr. Fredricksen.<br> It's me, Russell.<br> What are you doing<br> out here, kid?<br> I found the snipe and I<br> followed it under your porch.<br> But this snipe had a long tail<br> and looked more<br> like a large mouse.<br> Please, let me in.<br> No.<br> Aw, all right. You can...<br> come... in.<br> I've never been in a<br> floating house before.<br> Goggles...<br> Look at this stuff!<br> Are you going on a trip?<br> "Paradise Falls, a<br> land lost in time".<br> Are you going to South<br> America, mr. Fredricksen?<br> Don't touch that!<br> You'll soil it.<br> You know, most<br> people take a plane.<br> But you're smart,<br> because you have your<br> TV, clocks and stuff.<br> Ooo, is this how<br> you steer your house?<br> Does it really work?<br> This makes it turn right<br> and that way is left.<br> Hey, look! Buildings!<br> That building's so close,<br> I can almost touch it!<br> Wow, this is great!<br> You should try this,<br> mr. Fredricksen.<br> Look, there's a bus that could<br> take me home two blocks away!<br> Hey, I can see your<br> house from here!<br> Don't jerk around<br> so much, kid!<br> Well, that's not gonna work.<br> I know that cloud,<br> it's a "cumulonimbus".<br> Did you know that<br> a cumulonimbus...<br> Aaa, I stayed up all night<br> blowing up ballons... for what?<br> That's nice, kid.<br> What are you doing over there?<br> Look!<br> See? Cumulonimbus.<br> My bag!<br> Got you!<br> Uuu, I thought you were dead.<br> What happened?<br> I steered us. I did<br> it! I steered the house.<br> You steered us?<br> After you tied your stuff<br> down, you took a nap.<br> So I went ahead and<br> steered us down here.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> I can't tell where we are.<br> O, we're in South<br> America all right.<br> It was a singe. I used my<br> wilderness explorer GPS.<br> GP... what?<br> My dad gave it to me.<br> It shows exactly where<br> we are on the planet.<br> With this baby<br> we'll never be lost!<br> Ups.<br> We'll get you down,<br> find a bus stop,<br> and you'll just tell the man you<br> want to get back to your mother.<br> Sure, but I don't think they<br> have buses in Paradise Falls.<br> There, that ought to do it.<br> There, I'll give you some<br> change for the bus fare.<br> No, I'll just use<br> my city bus pass.<br> It's just gonna be like a billion<br> passes to get back to my house.<br> Mr. Fredricksen,<br> how much longer?<br> Well, we're up pretty high.<br> It'll take hours to get down.<br> I think that was a<br> building or something.<br> What was that,<br> mr. Fredricksen?<br> We can't be close<br> to the ground yet.<br> Wait, no, no!<br> Wait, wait!<br> Hang on!<br> Pull back!<br> Where... where are we?<br> This doesn't look like the city<br> or the jungle, mr. Fredricksen.<br> Don't worry,<br> Ellie. I've got it.<br> There it is!<br> Ellie, it's so beautiful!<br> We made it!<br> We made it! Russell, we<br> can float right over there.<br> Climb up, climb up!<br> Do you mean... assist you?<br> - Yeah, whatever.<br> - Ok, I'll climb up!<br> - Watch it!<br> - Sorry.<br> When you get up there,<br> go ahead and hoist me up.<br> Got it?<br> Are you on the porch yet?<br> What? That's it?<br> I came all this way here to get stuck<br> on the wrong end of this rock pile?<br> Ah... great.<br> Hey, if I could assist<br> you over there...<br> would you sign<br> up for my badge?<br> What are you talking about?<br> We could walk your<br> house to the fall.<br> - Walk it?<br> - Yeah.<br> After all we weigh it down, we<br> could walk it right over there.<br> Like a parade balloon.<br> Now, we'll walk to the<br> falls quickly and quietly,<br> with no rap music<br> or flash dancing.<br> We have three days at best till the<br> helium leaks out of those balloons.<br> And if we are not at the<br> falls when that happens...<br> we're not getting<br> to the falls.<br> There... I found sand!<br> Don't you worry, Ellie.<br> We'll get our<br> house over there.<br> It is fun already, isn't it?<br> By the time we get there,<br> You're gonna feel so<br> assisted... Oh, mr. Fredricksen,<br> if we happen to get separated,<br> use the wilderness<br> explorer call.<br> Wait, why are we going<br> to Paradise Falls, again?<br> Hey, let's play a game.<br> It's called: "See who<br> can be quiet the longest".<br> Cool! My mom loves that game!<br> Darn thing...<br> Come on, Russell, hurry it up.<br> Ah, I'm tired.<br> My knee hurts.<br> Which knee?<br> My elbow hurts and I have<br> to go to the bathroom.<br> I asked you about<br> that five minutes ago.<br> I didn't have to go then!<br> I don't wanna walk anymore...<br> Please, stop...<br> Russell, if you don't hurry<br> up, the tigers will eat you.<br> There are no tigers<br> in South America.<br> Zoology.<br> Ah, for the love of Pete... Go on<br> into the bushes and do your business.<br> Ok. Here! Hold my stuff!<br> I've always<br> wanted to try this.<br> Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose<br> to dig the hole before or after?<br> That's none of my concern.<br> Oh, it's "before"!<br> Tracks?<br> Snipe.<br> Here, snipe.<br> Come on out, snipe.<br> Snipe!<br> Got you. Don't be<br> afraid, little snipe.<br> I am a wilderness explorer,<br> so I'm a friend<br> to all of nature.<br> Want some more?<br> Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.<br> Come on out.<br> Come on. Come on...<br> Don't be afraid, little snipe.<br> Nice snipe. Good little snipe.<br> Nice giant... snipe!<br> I found the snipe.<br> Oh, did you?<br> - Are they tall?<br> - Oh, yes. They're very tall.<br> Do they have a lot of colors?<br> They do, indeed.<br> - Do they like chocolate?<br> - Oh, yeah...<br> Chocolate?<br> What is that thing?<br> It's a snipe.<br> There no such<br> thing as a snipe!<br> But you said...<br> Go on, get out of here! Go!<br> Careful, Russell.<br> Look, mr. Fredricksen,<br> he likes me.<br> - Russell!<br> - No, stop! That tickles!<br> Get out of here!<br> Go on! Get!<br> No, no, no. Kevin, it's ok.<br> Mr. Fredricksen is nice.<br> - Kevin?<br> - Yes, that's the name I just gave him.<br> Bit it, boo, scram!<br> Hey, that's mine!<br> Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!<br> Go on, bit it!<br> Can we keep him? Please?<br> I'll get the food for him, I'll walk<br> him, I'll change his newspapers...<br> No.<br> An explorer is<br> a friend to all,<br> be it a plant, a<br> fish or a tiny mole.<br> That doesn't even rhyme.<br> Yeah, it does.<br> - Hey, look, Kevin.<br> - What?<br> Hey, get down from there!<br> You're not allowed up there!<br> You come down here right now!<br> Can you believe this, Ellie?<br> Ellie?<br> Hey, Ellie, can<br> I keep the bird?<br> Aha.<br> She said for you to let me.<br> But I told him<br> no. I told you no.<br> N<br> - o!<br> I see you, back there.<br> Go on, get out of here! Shoo! Go<br> annoy someone else for a while.<br> Hey, are you ok over there?<br> Hello?<br> Oh, hello, sir.<br> Thank Goodness.<br> It's nice to know<br> someone else is up here.<br> I can smell you.<br> What?<br> You can... smell us?<br> I can smell you.<br> - Hey!<br> - You were talking to a rock.<br> Hey, that one<br> looks like a turtle.<br> Look at that one! That<br> one looks like a dog!<br> - Ah, it is a dog.<br> - What?<br> We're not allowed to have<br> dogs in my appartment.<br> Hey, I like dogs!<br> We have your dog!<br> - I wonder whom he belongs to.<br> - Sit, boy.<br> Hey, look, he's trained!<br> Shake.<br> Aha. Speak.<br> Hi, there.<br> Did that dog just<br> say "Hi, there"?<br> Oh, yes!<br> My name is Dug. I just<br> met you and I love you.<br> My master made me this collar.<br> He is a good and smart master<br> and he made me this collar<br> so that I may talk. Squirrel!<br> My master is good and smart.<br> It's not possible.<br> It is because my<br> master is smart.<br> Hey, cool! What<br> do these do, boy?<br> Would you cut...<br> I'd use that collar... I<br> would be happy if you stopped.<br> Russell, don't touch that.<br> It could be...<br> radioactive or something.<br> I am a great tracker. My master<br> sent me on a special mission.<br> All by myself. Have<br> you seen a bird?<br> I want to find one and<br> I've been on a scent.<br> I'm a great tracker.<br> Did I mention that?<br> Hey, that is a bird. I have<br> never seen one up close,<br> but this is the bird.<br> May I take your bird up<br> to camp as my prisoner?<br> Yes, yes, take it.<br> And on the way, learn how<br> to bark like a real dog.<br> I can bark.<br> And here's howling.<br> Can we keep him, please?<br> Please, please, please?<br> - No.<br> - But it's a talking dog!<br> It's just a weird<br> trick or something.<br> Let's get to the fall.<br> Please, be my prisoner! Oh,<br> please oh, please, be my prisoner!<br> Oh, here it is! I picked<br> up the bird's scent!<br> Wait a minute, wait a<br> minute. What is this?<br> Chocolate. I smell chocolate.<br> I'm getting prunes<br> and ginger cream.<br> Who are they?<br> Oh, man, the master<br> will not be pleased.<br> We'd better tell him someone<br> took the bird, right, Alfa?<br> No.<br> Soon enough the bird<br> will be ours again.<br> Find the scent, my compadres,<br> and you, too, shall have<br> much rewarding from the master<br> for the toil that you did.<br> Hey, Alfa, I think there's<br> something wrong with your collar.<br> You must have broken it.<br> Yeah. Your voice sounds funny.<br> Beta, Delta!<br> Perhaps you<br> desire... Squirrel!<br> Perhaps you desire to<br> challenge the right that<br> I have been assigned by<br> my strength and cunning.<br> No, no. No.<br> But maybe Dug would.<br> You might wanna ask him.<br> I wonder if he's found the bird<br> on his "very special mission".<br> Do not mention Dug<br> to me at this time.<br> His fool's errand will<br> keep him most occupied...<br> Most occupied, indeed.<br> Do you not agree with that<br> which I'm saying to you now?<br> Sure. But the second the master finds<br> out that you sent Dug out by himself,<br> none of us will get a treat.<br> You're unwise, my<br> trusted lieutenant.<br> This is Alfa. Calling<br> Dug. Come in, Dug.<br> Hi, Alfa. Your<br> voice sounds funny.<br> I know, I know!<br> Have you seen the bird?<br> Oh, yes. The bird<br> is my prisoner now.<br> Yeah, right.<br> Impossible. Where are you?<br> I am here with the bird<br> and I will bring it back<br> and then you like<br> me. Oh, gotta go.<br> Dug, who are you talking to?<br> - Wait, wait!<br> - What is Dug doing?<br> Why is he with<br> the small mailman?<br> Where are they?<br> There he is.<br> Come on!<br> Please, oh, please,<br> be my prisoner.<br> Dug, stop bothering Kevin!<br> That man over there<br> says I can take the bird.<br> And I love that man there<br> like he is my master.<br> I am not your master!<br> I am warning you<br> once again, bird!<br> - Hey, quit it!<br> - I am jumping on you now, bird!<br> At this rate we will<br> never get to the falls!<br> I am nobody's master, got it?<br> I don't want you here<br> and I don't want you here!<br> I'm stuck with you!<br> If you two don't clear out of here<br> by the time I count to three...<br> A ball! Oh, boy,<br> oh, boy, a ball!<br> Ball? You want a ball?<br> Yes, I do! I ever<br> so want the ball!<br> Go get it!<br> Oh, boy, I will get it<br> and then bring it back!<br> Quick, Russell, give<br> me some chocolate.<br> - Why?<br> - Just give to me!<br> Bird! Bird!<br> Come on, Russell.<br> Wait! Wait, mr. Fredricksen!<br> What are you doing?<br> Hey, we're pretty far now.<br> Kevin's gonna miss.<br> I think that did the trick.<br> Hi, master.<br> Afternoon.<br> Well, thanks for keeping<br> us dry, anyway, Ellie.<br> Which one is the front?<br> Well, boy...<br> Is this step<br> three or step five?<br> There.<br> All done. That's for you.<br> Well, tents are hard.<br> Wait, aren't you<br> super wilderness guy<br> with the GPS and the badges?<br> Yeah, but...<br> Can I tell you a secret?<br> - No.<br> - All right. Here it goes.<br> I never actually built a<br> tent before. There! I said it.<br> You've been camping<br> before, haven't you?<br> Well, never outside...<br> Well, why didn't you ask<br> your dad how to build a tent?<br> I don't think he wants<br> to talk about this stuff.<br> Try him sometime, maybe<br> he'll surprise you.<br> He's away alot, I<br> don't see him much.<br> He's gotta be home sometime.<br> I call, but Phyllis told<br> me I bug him too much.<br> Phyllis? You call your own<br> mother by her first name?<br> - Phyllis isn't my mom.<br> - Oh!<br> But he promised he'd come<br> to my Explorers Ceremony<br> to pin on my "Assisting<br> the elderly badge".<br> So he can show me how<br> about the tent then, right?<br> Hey, why don't<br> you get some sleep?<br> We don't want to wake the<br> travelling flea circus.<br> Dle Fredricksen, Dug says he<br> wants to take Kevin prisoner.<br> We have to protect him.<br> Can Kevin go with us?<br> All right, he can come.<br> Promise you won't leave him?<br> Yeah.<br> Cross your heart?<br> Cross my heart.<br> What have I got<br> myself into, Ellie?<br> Good morning, sweetheart.<br> We'd better get moving.<br> The bird's gone. Maybe<br> Russell won't notice.<br> All right, everybody up!<br> Where's Kevin?<br> He's wondered off!<br> - Dug, find Kevin! Kevin!<br> - Find the bird, find the bird!<br> Point!<br> Oh, look! There he is...<br> Point!<br> Hey, that's my roof!<br> Get off my roof!<br> Yeah, get off of his WROOF!<br> What is he doing?<br> The bird is calling<br> to her babies.<br> Her babies!<br> Kevin is a... girl?<br> Her house is over there,<br> on those twisty rocks.<br> She's been gathering food for her<br> babies and must get back to them.<br> Wait, Kevin is just leaving.<br> But you promised<br> to protect her.<br> Her babies need her. We gotta<br> make sure they're together.<br> Sorry, Russell. We've<br> lost enough time already.<br> Yeah...<br> It was her favorite chocolate.<br> Because you sent her<br> away, there's more for you.<br> Kevin?<br> Where's the bird? You<br> said you had the bird!<br> Oh, yes, oh, yes.<br> If I had said that,<br> I can see how you<br> would think that.<br> Where is it?<br> Oh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and<br> then I will again have the bird. Yes.<br> You lost it. why do I not<br> have a surprised feeling?<br> Well, at least you now<br> have led us to the small<br> mailman and to the one<br> that smells as prunes.<br> The master will be most<br> pleased we have found them.<br> He will ask them<br> many questions. Come.<br> Wait! We're not<br> going with you.<br> We're going to the fall.<br> Get away from me!<br> Down!<br> You came here... in that?<br> Yeah.<br> In a house? A floating house?<br> That is the darnest<br> thing I've ever seen!<br> You're not after<br> my bird, are you?<br> But if you need to borrow a cup<br> of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige!<br> Well, this is all<br> a misunderstanding.<br> My dogs made a mistake.<br> Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?<br> Well... yes.<br> The Charles Muntz?<br> Adventure's out there!<br> It's really him!<br> That's Charles Muntz!<br> It is?<br> Who's Charles Muntz?<br> Him!<br> Carl Fredricksen. My wife and<br> I, we were your biggest fans.<br> Oh, well, you're a<br> man of good taste.<br> Now you must be tired. Hungry?<br> Atention, everyone! These<br> people are no longer intruders.<br> They are our guests.<br> Yeah!<br> All right! I like<br> you temporarily.<br> I will not bite you.<br> The small mailman<br> smells like chocolate!<br> I'm sorry about the dogs,<br> I hope they weren't<br> too... rough on you.<br> Go ahead and pull your<br> airship right next to mine.<br> We are not actually going inside<br> the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?<br> Oh, would you like to?<br> Would I?<br> Wait up, mr. Muntz!<br> Jiminy Cricket!<br> - Not you!<br> - What do we do with Dug?<br> He lost the bird. Put him<br> in "the cone of shame".<br> I do not like "the<br> cone of shame".<br> Most of the collection is housed<br> in the world's top museums:<br> New York, Mnich, London.<br> Of course, I kept<br> the best for myself.<br> Did you ever. Look at that!<br> Oh, yes. The Arseloterium.<br> The beast charged while<br> I was brushing my teeth.<br> I used my shaving<br> kit to bring it down.<br> Oh, yeah, now, surprise me.<br> The only way to get it out<br> of Ethiopia at the time was<br> to have it declared<br> technical weapon.<br> Oh, my Gosh! The giant<br> Somalian Labradodis!<br> Oh, you recognize<br> it? I'm impressed!<br> There's an interesting<br> story there.<br> Excellent choice.<br> I found it on safari,<br> with Roosevelt.<br> He and I fell into a habit of<br> playing Gin Rummy in the evenings<br> and did he cheat!<br> He was horrible.<br> Master, dinner is ready.<br> Oh, dear, broken translator.<br> I think it's that<br> loose wire again.<br> - There you go, big fellow.<br> - Thank you, master.<br> I liked his other voice.<br> Well, dinner is served.<br> Right this way.<br> So, how are<br> things States side?<br> Almost tempted to<br> go back a few times.<br> But I have<br> unfinished work here.<br> Please! I hope you're hungry.<br> Because Epsilon is the<br> finest chef I've ever had.<br> Epsilon, you've done it again!<br> Yeah!<br> Hey! Hey!<br> My Ellie would have<br> loved all these.<br> You know, because of<br> you she had this dream<br> to come down here<br> and live by the fall.<br> I'm honored. And<br> now you've made it.<br> You sure we're not a<br> bother? I'd hate to impose.<br> No, no, it's a<br> pleasure to have guests.<br> A real treat.<br> Treat?<br> Where's my treat?<br> I want my treat!<br> Hey!<br> I shouldn't have<br> used that word.<br> Having guests is a delight!<br> More often I get thieves trying<br> to steal what is rightfully mine.<br> No...<br> They called me<br> a fraud, those...<br> But once I bring back this<br> creature, my name will be cleared.<br> Beautiful, isn't it?<br> Oh, I've spent a<br> lifetime tracking it.<br> Sometimes, years go by<br> between seeings.<br> I've tried to smoke it out of<br> that death land where it lives.<br> Can't go in after it.<br> Once in, there's no way out.<br> I lost so many dogs.<br> Here they come tnose bandits who<br> think the bird is theirs to take!<br> is a very dangerous place.<br> Hey, that looks like Kevin!<br> - Kevin?<br> - Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird!<br> I trained it to follow us.<br> Follow you?<br> Impossible. How?<br> She likes chocolate.<br> - Chocolate?<br> - Yeah.<br> I gave her some of my chocolate.<br> She goes wild about it.<br> But it ran off.<br> Let's go now.<br> You know, Carl...<br> these people who<br> pass through here<br> A surveyor making a map...<br> a botanist<br> cataloguing plants...<br> an old man taking his<br> house to Paradise Falls.<br> That's the best one yet, I<br> can't wait to hear how it ends.<br> Well, it's been a wonderful<br> evening, but we'd better be going.<br> You're not leaving.<br> We don't want to take<br> advantage of your hospitality.<br> Come on, Russell.<br> But we haven't even<br> had dessert yet.<br> Oh, the boy is right.<br> You haven't had dessert.<br> Epsilon here makes a<br> delicious cherries jubilee.<br> You really must<br> stay! I insist!<br> We have so much<br> more to talk about!<br> Kevin?<br> It's near.<br> Get them!<br> - Hurry!<br> - Kevin!<br> Hurry! Dogs! Hurry!<br> Master! Over here!<br> Here!<br> Go on, master!<br> Left!<br> Russell!<br> Get back!<br> Go on, master! I<br> will stop the dogs!<br> Stop, you, dogs!<br> Help!<br> Give me your hand!<br> Hang on to Kevin!<br> Kevin!<br> No, no, no. Kevin...<br> Stay down.<br> She's hurt real bad.<br> Can't we help her get home?<br> All right. But we gotta hurry.<br> - You lost them?<br> - No, it was Dug.<br> Yeah, he's with them.<br> he helped them escape!<br> Wait. Wait a minute.<br> Dug.<br> - See anything?<br> - No, my pack is not following us.<br> Boy, they are dumb!<br> This is crazy.<br> I finally meet my chidlhood<br> hero and he's trying to kill us.<br> - What a joke.<br> - Hey, I know a joke!<br> A squirrel walks up<br> up to a tree and says:<br> "I forgot to store acorns<br> for winter and now I am dead".<br> It is funny because<br> the squirrel gets dead.<br> Careful, Russell.<br> You ok, Kevin?<br> You know what,<br> mr. Fredricksen?<br> The wilderness isn't<br> quite what I expected.<br> Yeah? How so?<br> It's kind of... wild.<br> I mean, it's not how they<br> made it sound in my book.<br> Get used to that, kid.<br> My dad made it sound so easy.<br> He is really good at camping,<br> and how to make fire<br> from rocks and stuff...<br> He used to come to all<br> my squad lodge meetings.<br> And afterwards, we go<br> get icecream that fattens.<br> I always get chocolate<br> and he gets butter brickle.<br> Then we sit on this<br> one curve, right outside<br> and I'll count all the blue cars<br> and he counts all the red ones<br> and whoever gets<br> the most wins.<br> I like that curve.<br> It might sound boring,<br> but I think the boring stuff is<br> the stuff I remember the most.<br> Look, there it is!<br> Hold on, Russell, stand still.<br> Look at that bird go! Wait<br> up, you overgrown chicken!<br> That's it! Go, Kevin!<br> Go find your babies!<br> Run, Kevin, run!<br> Oh, no!<br> Russell, d-mi cuitul tu!<br> Get away from my bird!<br> No!<br> No!<br> Careful, I want it in good<br> shape for my retirement.<br> Let it go!<br> Stop!<br> Kevin!<br> You gave away Kevin.<br> You just... gave her away.<br> This is none of my concern.<br> I didn't ask for any of these!<br> Master, it's all right.<br> I am not your master!<br> If you hadn't shown up, none<br> of these would have happened.<br> Bad dog, bad dog!<br> Whether you assist me or not,<br> I am going to Paradise<br> Falls, if it kills me!<br> Here.<br> I don't want this anymore.<br> Russell?<br> - Russell!<br> - I'm gonna help Kevin<br> even if you won't!<br> No, Russell, no!<br> Russell?<br> I was hiding under your<br> porch because I love you.<br> Can I stay?<br> Can you stay? Well,<br> you're my dog, aren't you?<br> And I'm your master.<br> You're my master?<br> - Oh, boy!<br> - Good boy, Dug!<br> You're a good boy!<br> Yes!<br> Don't worry, Kevin,<br> I'll save you.<br> And they wouldn't believe me.<br> Just wait till they<br> get a look at you!<br> Master.<br> The small mailman<br> has returned.<br> What?<br> Let me go!<br> Where is your elderly friend?<br> He's not my friend anymore.<br> If you're here, Fredricksen<br> can't be far behind.<br> Where are you keeping Kevin?<br> Let me go!<br> Scream all you<br> want, small mailman.<br> None of your mailmen<br> friends can hear you.<br> I will unleash all my<br> wilderness explorer training!<br> Alfa, Fredricksen<br> is coming back!<br> Guard that bird.<br> If you see the old man,<br> you know what to do.<br> Where are you going?
