                        This is what I get in return for 30 years<br> of service for my company?<br> And they send some yo-yo like you<br> in here,<br> to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?<br> They should be telling you<br> you're out of a job.<br> You have a lot of gall, coming in here<br> and firing your No.1 producer.<br> Then you're going to go home tomorrow and make<br> more money than you've ever made in your life<br> and I'm going to go home<br> without a pay check. Fuck you.<br> I guess you leave me dumbfounded.<br> I don't know where this is coming from.<br> How am I supposed to go home as a man<br> and explain to my wife I lost my job?<br> On a stress level, I've heard that<br> losing your job is like a death in the family.<br> But personally,<br> I feel more like<br> the people I worked with<br> were my family and I died.<br> I can't afford to be unemployed.<br> I have a house payment,<br> I have children.<br> I don't know how you can live<br> with yourself,<br> but I'm sure that you'll find a way<br> while the rest of us are suffering.<br> Who the fuck are you, man?<br> Excellent question. Who the fuck am I?<br> Poor Steve has worked here<br> for seven years.<br> He's never had a meeting with me<br> before or passed me in the hall,<br> or told me a story in the break room.<br> That's because I don't work here.<br> I work for another company that lends<br> me out to pussies like Steve's boss<br> who don't have the balls<br> to sack their own employees,<br> And in some cases for good reason, because<br> people do crazy shit when they get fired.<br> Did I do something wrong?<br> I mean, is there something<br> I could do differently here?<br> This is not an assessment of your<br> productivity. Try not to take this personally.<br> Don't take it personally.<br> Steven, I want you to review this packet.<br> Take it seriously. I think you're gonna<br> find a lot of good answers in here.<br> I'm sure this is gonna be very helpful -<br> a packet.<br> Thank you... A packet.<br> Well, anybody who ever built an empire<br> or changed the world sat where you are right now.<br> And it's because they sat there<br> they were able to do it.<br> That's the truth.<br> I'm gonna need your keycard.<br> Great. OK.<br> Now, I want you to take the day, go get<br> together your personal things, then tomorrow<br> you get yourself some exercise.<br> You go out for a jog,<br> you give yourself some routines<br> and pretty soon you find your legs.<br> How do I get in touch with you?<br> - Don't worry, we'll be in touch with you soon.<br> This is just the beginning.<br> I'll never see Steve again.<br> To know me is to fly with me.<br> This is where I live.<br> When I run my card,<br> the system automatically prompts the desk clerk<br> to greet me with this exact statement:<br> Pleasure to see you again,<br> Mr Bingham.<br> It's these kinds of systemized friendly<br> touches that keep my world in orbit.<br> All the things you probably hate<br> about travelling -<br> the recycled air, the artificial lighting,<br> the digital juice dispensers,<br> the cheap sushi -<br> are warm reminders that I'm home.<br> Do you want the cancer?<br> The what?<br> - Do you want the cancer?<br> The cancer?<br> The can...sir?<br> - Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.<br> How much does your life weigh?<br> Imagine for a second<br> that you're carrying a backpack.<br> I want you to feel the straps<br> on your shoulders. Feel 'em?<br> Now I want you to pack it with<br> all the stuff that you have in your life.<br> You start with the little things,<br> the things on shelves and in drawers<br> the knick-knacks, the collectibles.<br> Feel the weight as that adds up.<br> Then you start adding larger stuff -<br> clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens...<br> your TV...<br> The backpack should be getting<br> pretty heavy now. And you go bigger.<br> Your couch, bed, your kitchen table.<br> Stuff it all in there.<br> Your car, get it in there.<br> Your home, whether it's<br> a studio apartment or a two bedroom house.<br> I want you to stuff it all<br> into that backpack.<br> Now try to walk.<br> It's kind of hard, isn't it?<br> This is what we do to ourselves<br> on a daily basis<br> We weigh ourselves down until we can't<br> even move. And make no mistake...<br> moving is living.<br> Now, I'm gonna set that backpack on fire.<br> What do you want to take out of it?<br> Photos?<br> Photos are for people who can't remember.<br> Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn.<br> In fact, let everything burn<br> and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing.<br> It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?<br> Welcome back, Mr Bingham.<br> Ryan Bingham's office.<br> - You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City.<br> They were out of all full-size sedans.<br> - Did you try...<br> Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable<br> No.1 Gold Club status and years in the program.<br> They are literally moving mountains<br> to see you in a Sebring.<br> Fair enough. Any other messages?<br> - Er...your sister Kara called.<br> Needs to speak urgently<br> about your sister's wedding.<br> I told her you were mid-air,<br> and not even I knew your final destination.<br> Well done. - And you got an invitation<br> to speak at GoalQuest in Vegas.<br> GoalQuest 20?<br> Every once in a while, I do speaking engagements,<br> motivational kind of stuff. But GoalQuest?<br> We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.<br> It's got a hologram on it.<br> They're calling it Dos Equis.<br> All right, I'll check in.<br> - I've got Craig Gregory for you.<br> Wait...ah.<br> Fuck.<br> How is my little road warrior?<br> Hey, 20 minutes from boarding<br> into a world of bliss.<br> Real good numbers out of Phoenix,<br> Ry guy ...<br> and you know that Big Auto is about to cut<br> another 10K before the end of the month?<br> No kidding.<br> - Christmas came early.<br> Wish I could have you in five places at once, but I do need<br> you back here in Omaha by the end of the week. All right?<br> I thought you needed me everywhere.<br> - Well, we got something real big, a real game changer.<br> What are we talking about here?<br> You'll see. Today I took my first crap<br> in two weeks - hallelujah.<br> That's me hanging up on you.<br> - Great, love that sound.<br> Are you satisfied with Maestro?<br> Yeah, I am.<br> A little stingy with their miles.<br> I like Hertz.<br> No, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.<br> If a car has over 20,000 miles, I won't drive it.<br> Maestro doesn't instant checkout.<br> I like the park-and-go.<br> Hertz doesn't guarantee navigation.<br> - That's funny; you don't seem like a girl who needs directions.<br> I hate asking for directions.<br> That's why I get a nav.<br> That new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.<br> Is that a joke?<br> - Yes.<br> Their kiosk placement blows.<br> - They never have available upgrades.<br> Basically, it's a fleet of shit boxes. I<br> don't know how they're still in business.<br> I'm Ryan.<br> - I'm Alex.<br> Aww...Maplewood card.<br> How dare you bring that into this palace?<br> Hilton offers equal value and better food but<br> the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check-in.<br> I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality.<br> There's an industry term for that.<br> It's a mixture of faux and homey - faumey.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I wasn't sure this actually existed.<br> This is the American Airlines...<br> - It's a Concierge Key, yeah.<br> What is that, carbon fibre?<br> - Graphite.<br> Oh, I love the weight. - I was pretty excited<br> the day that bad boy came in.<br> I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers.<br> That's not bad.<br> - Don't patronize me.<br> What's your total?<br> - It's a personal question.<br> Pleace.<br> - And we hardly know each other.<br> Come on, show some hubris.<br> Come on, impress me.<br> I bet it's huge.<br> - You have no idea.<br> How big?<br> What is it, this big? This big?<br> - I don't want to brag.<br> Oh, come on! Come on.<br> Let's just say I have a number in mind<br> and I haven't hit it yet.<br> This is pretty fucking sexy.<br> - Hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.<br> We're two people who get turned on by elite status.<br> I think cheap is our starting point.<br> There's nothing cheap about loyalty.<br> So, we came up with this master plan,<br> which was for me...<br> ...to put gauze,<br> to put bandages on both my hands.<br> Then we got on the plane,<br> transatlantic, flying to um...Zurich.<br> Walked up, waited till it was dark,<br> and I walked up to the bathroom with her.<br> Everybody was watching the movie and I was like...<br> Opened up, went inside. She opened the door for me,<br> and came in like she was gonna help me.<br> We gave it our best shot. It wasn't<br> great. But it was fun. It was tricky.<br> Give me some details.<br> - It's not so easy. Have you ever tried it?<br> It's not so easy.<br> - Yes, I have.<br> Really?<br> - Really.<br> You've done that?<br> - I have done that.<br> On a transatlantic flight?<br> - On a domestic flight - regional, actually.<br> At night-time?<br> - Daytime.<br> What?<br> - How do you do that?<br> Oh, I'm really flexible.<br> Look. Ohh.<br> Ah, I should throw these out.<br> We can always use that room<br> with the ice machine.<br> Not in there. Look.<br> Good call on that towel rack.<br> I like how you burritoed me<br> in the sofa cushions.<br> I was improvising.<br> Shame we didn't make it to the closet.<br> We got to do this again.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I'm in Newark on the 12th,<br> Modesto on the 13th...<br> Oklahoma City on the 15th...<br> Any Southwest? I'll be swinging by<br> Albuquerque week of the 16th.<br> No, I'm in Florida on the 20th.<br> - Fort Lauderdale?<br> Miami.<br> - That's nothing. - 40 minutes.<br> I should probably go back to my room<br> so I can wake up in my bed.<br> I think that would be<br> the ladylike thing to do.<br> Nice meeting you.<br> - A pleasure.<br> Hello?<br> Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?<br> Every family has the one person<br> who keeps the genealogy in check.<br> That's my sister Kara - the glue.<br> Fine. You and the kids?<br> Missy's outstanding,<br> Matthew made varsity. How's the road?<br> Couldn't be better.<br> Good. So, Ryan?<br> Yeah?<br> I didn't even want to have to ask you this, because<br> I know how you are about doing things for others.<br> But we're coming up on three weeks to go to Julie's wedding<br> and there's something we could really use your help on.<br> Yeah?<br> We've been sending people these kits,<br> so they can print out photos<br> of Julie and Jim on cardbord,<br> and then take photos of them in interesting places,<br> kinda like that gnome in the French movie.<br> Why?<br> Because it's Julie's wedding and she thinks<br> it would be fun. Does it matter why?<br> How is Julie?<br> Would you call her.<br> She thinks you've turned to butter.<br> You're awfully isolated the way you live.<br> - Isolated? I'm surrounded.<br> So your assistant said<br> you were gonna be in Vegas.<br> Did he?<br> Can you get a photo of the cut-out<br> in front of the Luxor pyramid?<br> The place is a shithole.<br> Nobody stays there.<br> Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check in.<br> Can you just take a stupid photo?<br> I'll try my best.<br> Thank you for trying your best.<br> Last year,<br> I spent 322 days on the road,<br> which means I had to spend<br> Hey, neighbor.<br> I signed for this while you were gone.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> I hope it wasn't too much of a bother.<br> - Nah.<br> It's my sister. I haven't met the guy yet.<br> They're getting married.<br> Lots of luck.<br> - I know, right?<br> What are you doing tonight?<br> You wanna come over later?<br> Um...I've started seeing somebody.<br> Oh. OK. Great.<br> Hey, it's good to see you.<br> You too.<br> - It seems like it's been a while this time.<br> I'm thrilled that everyone's back<br> under one roof. Welcome home, boys.<br> I know there's been a lot of whispering about<br> why we're here, so let me jump right in.<br> Retailers are down 20%.<br> Auto industry is in the dump.<br> Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat.<br> It is one of the worst times on record<br> for America.<br> This is our moment.<br> Now, last summer, we received<br> a dynamite young woman here from Cornell.<br> And she had some pretty big ideas<br> that she challenged me with.<br> And my first reaction was,<br> "Who does this kid think that she is?"<br> But after I gave it a listen,<br> she really knocked me out. So...<br> With a peek into our future,<br> Natalie Keener.<br> If there's one word I want to<br> leave you with today, it's this.<br> Glocal?<br> Glocal.<br> Our global must become local.<br> This company keeps 23 people<br> on the road at least 250 days a year.<br> It's expensive and it's inefficient<br> When I came to Craig<br> three months ago with this,<br> he told me, and quite astutely, it's only<br> a problem if you have a solution.<br> Well, today I stand before you<br> with just that.<br> You all know Ned in reception.<br> Today I'm gonna fire Ned.<br> Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR<br> will hire you back this afternoon.<br> We'll see about that.<br> Now Ned could be any employee in any one<br> of our clients' locations worldwide.<br> Strategy packets<br> will be shipped in advance.<br> Ned will be given a seat and find one<br> of our transition specialists waiting for him.<br> Mr Laskin,<br> the reason we're having this conversation<br> is your position is no longer available.<br> I don't understand. I'm fired?<br> Hearing the words<br> "You've been let go" is never easy.<br> Change is always scary,<br> but consider the following:<br> anybody who ever built an empire or<br> changed the world sat where you are now.<br> And it's because they sat there<br> that they were able to do it.<br> That's my fucking line.<br> But what happens now?<br> This is the first step of a process that<br> will end with you in a new job that fulfills you.<br> Yeah, but how does it work?<br> Take the packet in front of you.<br> Review it - all the answers<br> you're looking for are inside.<br> Start filling out the necessary information and<br> before you know it you will be on your way to new opportunities.<br> Now Ned, I need you to go back to your desk<br> and start putting together your things.<br> As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it<br> if you didn't spread the news just yet.<br> Panic doesn't help anyone.<br> I understand.<br> Give it up for Ned.<br> You can start the morning in Boston,<br> stop in Dallas over lunch,<br> and finish the day in San Francisco.<br> All for the price of a T1 line.<br> Our inflated travel budget<br> is eviscerated by 85%.<br> And more importantly,<br> to you guys on the road,<br> no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa,<br> no more hours lost to weather delays.<br> You get to come home.<br> Tell me you're not taking this seriously.<br> That's why I brought the entire company in<br> from the road,<br> because we're not taking it seriously.<br> There is a methodology to what I do.<br> There is a reason why it works.<br> Coke and IBM have been doing this<br> for years. Are you familiar with them?<br> Like anything else, it'll take a few months<br> to sort of transition and everybody will settle in.<br> Who are you taking off the road?<br> - How are you not getting this?<br> You are grounded.<br> Everybody's grounded. It's done.<br> What we do here is brutal<br> and it does leave people devastated.<br> But there is a dignity to the way I do it.<br> By stabbing them in the chest<br> instead of the back. Is that right?<br> You wanted to see me?<br> - Well, uhm...<br> You know what? Yeah, come on in.<br> - Great job out there.<br> Thank you. How's everyone taking it?<br> - Great.<br> Listen, I admire your...zeal.<br> And I think you have some very good ideas.<br> But you know nothing<br> about the realities of my industry.<br> You can set up an iChat,<br> but you don't know how people think.<br> Actually I minored in psychology.<br> - Nice.<br> OK, kiddo, fire me.<br> - Ryan...<br> If she's gonna do this regular basis, don't<br> you wanna know if she can fire somebody?<br> She's fired Ned.<br> - My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.<br> You don't need to do this.<br> - No, it's OK. I got this.<br> Mr Bingham,<br> I regret to inform you that your position<br> at this company is no longer available.<br> Hm. Who the hell are you?<br> My name is Miss Keener. I'm here<br> today to discuss your future.<br> My future? The only one who can fire me<br> is Craig Gregory.<br> Mr Gregory hired me to handle this for him.<br> - Handle what? Handle Me?<br> Mr. Gregory hired me,<br> he's the only one who can fire me.<br> You know what? I'm gonna go talk to him.<br> - Mr Bingham...<br> No, no, no. You can't follow me.<br> You're on a computer screen, remember?<br> Right.<br> - Let's try this again. Fire me again.<br> I just did.<br> - Actually, you didn't. Fire me.<br> That's enough. I think we get it.<br> Mr Bingham, I'm here to inform you<br> your position is no longer available.<br> I'm fired?<br> - Yes, you're fired.<br> Never say fired.<br> - You've been let go.<br> Why?<br> This is a mythical situation.<br> How could I possibly know why?<br> Why doesn't matter,<br> you never know why.<br> It's important to not focus on the why, and rather, spend<br> your energy thinking about your future.<br> Well, I'm gonna spend<br> my energy on suing you<br> unless you give me a good<br> reason why you're firing me.<br> Mr. Bingham, the reason's not important.<br> S you're firing me without grounds?<br> Now I really have a lawsuit.<br> I get what you're trying to say, Ryan.<br> - Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.<br> Personally?<br> This is the most personal situation<br> that you are ever gonna enter,<br> so before you try to revolutionise my business,<br> I'd like to know<br> that you actually know my business.<br> That's a hell of a way<br> to welcome her to the team.<br> Am I the only one that sees that by doing<br> this we're making ourselves irrelevant?<br> No, frankly,<br> we're making you irrelevant.<br> Nice.<br> - Don't blame me.<br> Blame the high fuel costs, blame insurance<br> premiums, blame technology.<br> Watch yourself. You're a little too young<br> to become a dinosaur.<br> I'm not a dinosaur.<br> - I want you to show her the ropes.<br> What do I know what goes on here?<br> Get Ferguson to do it.<br> I'm not talking about here.<br> No.<br> - Yeah.<br> You're very very confident<br> this girl doesn't know what she's doing. So...<br> I'm sorry. I don't think a MySpace page<br> qualifies you to rewire an entire company.<br> Great. Here's your chance. Go out there, show her<br> the magic, take her through the paces.<br> I'm not a fucking tour guide.<br> Now here we go.<br> - Bingham, here's the boat.<br> And here's you.,<br> Do you want to be in the boat?<br> Yeah, alone.<br> We're ringing the bell,<br> we're rounding everybody up.<br> You want to stay out there a little bit longer, you're<br> welcome, but you will not be alone. Okay?<br> You let me know.<br> Oh, Christ.<br> What?<br> - Follow me.<br> I really like my luggage.<br> That's exactly what it is - luggage.<br> Know how much time you lose<br> checking in?<br> I don't know. Five...10 minutes?<br> - 35 minutes a flight.<br> I travel 270 days a year.<br> That's 157 hours.<br> That makes seven days.<br> You willing to throw away an entire week on that?<br> You don't need this.<br> Sorry, you don't need that.<br> You're not gonna need that.<br> They have neck pillows on the plane.<br> This - they have better ones there.<br> I'll get rid of this.<br> I can just meet you at security.<br> Thank you.<br> Bingo - Asians.<br> You can't be serious.<br> - Never get behind people traveling with infants.<br> I've never seen a stroller collapse<br> in less than 20 minutes.<br> Old people are worse.<br> Their bodies are littered with hidden metal<br> and they never seem to appreciate<br> how little time they have left on earth.<br> Five words: randomly selected<br> for additional screening.<br> Asians, they pack light, travel efficiently,<br> and they've got a thing for slip-on shoes, God love em.<br> That's racist.<br> - I'm like my mother, I stereotype. It's faster.<br> Are you mad at your computer?<br> I type with purpose.<br> What is it that you're working on<br> so furiously?<br> I'm building a workflow<br> of firing techniques.<br> It's questions and responses,<br> actions and reactions.<br> A script taking you through the steps<br> of firing someone.<br> Who's it for?<br> Well, theoretically,<br> you could put it in the hands<br> of anyone and they'd be downsizing immediately.<br> All you have to do is follow the steps.<br> Natalie,<br> what is it you think we do here?<br> We prepare the newly-unemployed for<br> the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting,<br> while minimizing legal blowback.<br> That's what we're selling.<br> It's not what we're doing.<br> OK, what are we doing?<br> - We are here to make limbo tolerable,<br> to ferry wounded souls across the river of dread<br> until the point where hope is dimly visible.<br> Then stop the boat, shove 'em<br> in the water and make 'em swim.<br> That's really impressive.<br> Are you gonna put that in your book?<br> I gotta grab this.<br> I'll meet you at the car rental.<br> Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.<br> I'm in Hotlanta and I need<br> a rib-joint recommend bad.<br> Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.<br> You never called.<br> - I wasn't sure what was appropriate.<br> Appropriate? Ryan, I'm not some waitress<br> you banged in a snowstorm.<br> That word has no place<br> in our vocabulary.<br> I'm the woman that you don't have<br> to worry about.<br> Sounds like a trap.<br> - Listen...<br> the next time that you're worried<br> about manners, don't.<br> If you wanna call, call.<br> Just think of me as yourself, only with a vagina.<br> When am I gonna see you?<br> Well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD,<br> with a connection in ORD into SDF.<br> Sorry.<br> Yeah, tell me about it.<br> How long's your layover? They got<br> multiples into SDF. Think you could push?<br> Yeah, I can push.<br> All you have to do today<br> is watch and listen.<br> And when I talk about a strategy<br> packet, hand them one of those.<br> Sounds great.<br> So although I wish I were here<br> with better news,<br> the fact is that you and I are<br> sitting here today because<br> this will be your last week<br> of employment at this company.<br> Why me?<br> - What am I supposed to do now?<br> Am I supposed to feel better<br> that I'm not the only one losing my job?<br> This is ridiculous!<br> I have been a fine employee for over 10 years<br> and this is the way you treat me.<br> How do you sleep at night, man?<br> Huh?<br> How's your family?<br> They sleeping well at night?<br> Electricity still on?<br> Heat still on, refrigerator full of food?<br> Gas tank full of gas?<br> Going to Chuck E. Cheese<br> this weekend or something?<br> Not me.<br> No, my kids,<br> we're not gonna do anything.<br> What do you suggest I tell them?<br> Perhaps you're underestimating<br> the positive effect<br> that your career transition<br> can have on your children.<br> The positive effect?<br> I make about 90 grand a year now.<br> Unemployment is what -<br> Is that one of your positive effects?<br> We'll get to be cosier cause I'm not gonna<br> be able to pay my mortgage on my house.<br> So maybe we can move into a nice<br> fucking one-bedroom apartment somewhere.<br> And I guess without benefits,<br> I'll be able to hold my daughter as she,<br> you know, suffers from her asthma<br> that I won't be able to afford<br> the medication for.<br> Well...tests have shown that children under<br> moderate trauma have a tendency to<br> apply themselves academically...<br> ..as a method of coping.<br> Go fuck yourself.<br> That's what my kids will think.<br> Your children's admiration is important to you?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, it was.<br> Well, I doubt they ever admired you,<br> Bob.<br> Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed<br> to be consoling me?<br> I'm not a shrink, Bob.<br> I'm a wake-up call.<br> You know why kids love athletes?<br> - I don't know. Cause they screw lingerie models?<br> No, that's why we love athletes.<br> Kids love athletes<br> because they follow their dreams.<br> Well, I can't dunk.<br> - No, but you can cook.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Your rsum says that you minored<br> in French culinary arts.<br> Most students,<br> they work on the fryer at KFC,<br> but you bussed tables<br> at Il Picador to support yourself.<br> Then you get out of college<br> and then you come and you work here.<br> How much did they first pay you<br> to give up on your dreams?<br> - And when were you going to stop<br> and come back<br> and do what makes you happy?<br> Good question.<br> I see guys who work at the same<br> company for their entire lives,<br> guys exactly like you.<br> They clock in, they clock out,<br> and they never have a moment of happiness.<br> You have an opportunity here, Bob.<br> This is a rebirth.<br> If not for you, do it for your children.<br> He just waltzes in and cuts in line?<br> We reserve priority assistance<br> for our Hilton Honors members.<br> The promotions are great.<br> You should check it out.<br> Hungry much?<br> Our business expense<br> allots $40 each for dinner.<br> I plan on grabbing<br> as many miles as I can.<br> Okay, you gotta fill me in on the miles<br> thing. What is that about?<br> Are you talking about...<br> like frequent flyer miles?<br> You really want to know?<br> - I'm dying to know.<br> I don't spend a nickel if I can help it<br> unless it somehow profits my mileage account.<br> So what are you saving up for -<br> Hawaii, South of France?<br> It's not like that.<br> The miles are the goal.<br> That's it?<br> You're saving just to save?<br> Just say I have a number in mind<br> and I haven't hit it yet.<br> That's a little abstract.<br> What's the target?<br> I'd rather not.<br> - Is it a secret target?<br> It's 10 million miles.<br> OK. Isn't 10 million just a number?<br> - Pi is just a number.<br> Well, we all need a hobby.<br> No, I... I don't mean to belittle your collection.<br> I get it. It sounds cool.<br> I'd be the seventh person to do it.<br> More people have walked on the moon.<br> Do they throw you a parade?<br> - You get lifetime executive status,<br> you get to meet the chief pilot,<br> Maynard Finch...<br> And they put your name on the side of a plane.<br> Men get hard-ons putting their name on stuff.<br> You guys dont grow up.<br> It's like you need to pee on everything.<br> - Now who's stereotyping?<br> Fear of mortality. It's like,<br> yeah, you're gonna die one day.<br> Why do you suppose that is singular to men?<br> Probably because you can't have babies.<br> - The baby argument.<br> If I had that many miles...<br> I would show up at an airport,<br> look at the destination board,<br> pick a place and go.<br> Thanks for the advice.<br> OK. Closer.<br> Way closer.<br> Still closer.<br> Closer.<br> Uh...a little left.<br> Down a little.<br> Too far. Up. Up one more inch.<br> I don't get it. Why does your sister<br> want a fake photo?<br> My sister is kooky. She thinks<br> this is charming. It's like the gnome thing.<br> No, I mean, why would she want a fake photo<br> in front of the St Louis airport?<br> Are you kidding - Lambert Field?<br> The Wright brothers flew through there.<br> That domed main terminal,<br> is the first of its kind, it's a precursor<br> of everything from JFK to de Gaulle.<br> Pretty sweet.<br> - Just take the picture.<br> Well, that's a keeper.<br> Let me see it.<br> Why she wants dozens of reminders of all the<br> places she hasn't been is beyond me.<br> I'm sure she'll be crushed<br> for having missed this airport.<br> Look, before Lindbergh could cross the Atlantic,<br> he took off from one of those runways.<br> You ever wonder why they called it<br> the Spirit of St Louis?<br> No.<br> - Well...<br> Do you know how fucked<br> this place is now?<br> I am the one thing - the one thing-<br> preventing this place<br> from being totally fucked in the ass.<br> Sometimes they just need to vent.<br> Please, for the love of God,<br> can I fire the next one?<br> Miss Barnes, thank you for joining us.<br> - I'm here to be fired, right?<br> Well, we're here<br> to talk about your future.<br> You don't have to sugar coat it.<br> I get the drill.<br> What are they offering?<br> Inside the packet, you'll find a clearly<br> worked out severance package.<br> Give me the bullet points.<br> It's actually pretty good -<br> three months' pay, six months' medical.<br> And a full year of placement services<br> through our company CTC.<br> Placement services. That's generous.<br> Commonly it takes one month of searching<br> for every $10,000 you expect to earn in salary.<br> So I could be looking for a while.<br> - Not necessarily.<br> Don't even sweat it.<br> I'm pretty confident about my plans.<br> Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> There's this beautiful bridge<br> by my house.<br> I'm gonna go jump off it.<br> Natalie.<br> Hey!<br> Natalie!<br> People say these things all the time.<br> It's part of the trade.<br> They do?<br> - Yeah.<br> They say crazy things.<br> They get worked up.<br> She was really calm.<br> I think that's a good sign.<br> So they don't ever actually do it?<br> - No. No. It's just talk.<br> How do you know? Do you follow up?<br> - I mean, no, nothing good's gonna come of that, but..<br> I wouldn't worry about it.<br> This is what we do, Natalie. We take people<br> at their most fragile and we set em adrift.<br> Ready to go back in?<br> All right, let's go. Come on.<br> No, I'm fine. Tell me something sweet.<br> I'll be back soon. I'm not really sure how long<br> this exercise is supposed to last.<br> No, I don't even think of him that way.<br> He's old.<br> I- I'm done?<br> - I wasn't expecting this. Not at all.<br> Just like that?<br> I'm disappointed that I've given<br> so much of my life...<br> This is not fair.<br> There are people that are gonna be<br> way more qualified than me now.<br> I don't know what to do<br> when I wake up tomorrow.<br> You OK?<br> Are we going?<br> - Yeah.<br> This is how I start every day of my life.<br> Now, this is gonna be a little difficult,<br> so stay with me.<br> You have a new backpack.<br> Only this time,<br> I want you to fill it with people.<br> Start with casual acquaintances,<br> friends of friends,<br> folks around the office.<br> And then you move into the people that you trust<br> with your most intimate secrets -<br> your cousins, your aunts, your uncles,<br> your brothers, your sisters,<br> your parents,<br> and finally your husband, your wife,<br> your boyfriend or your girlfriend.<br> You get them into that backpack.<br> And don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you<br> to light it on fire.<br> Feel the weight of that bag.<br> Make no mistake, your relationships are<br> the heaviest components in your life.<br> Do you feel the straps<br> cutting into your shoulders?<br> All those negotiations and arguments,<br> and secrets and compromises.<br> You don't need to carry all that weight.<br> Why don't you set that bag down?<br> Some animals were meant to carry each other,<br> to live symbiotically for a lifetime -<br> star-crossed lovers, monogamous swans.<br> We are not those animals.<br> The slower we move, the faster we die.<br> We are not swans.<br> We're sharks.<br> Never?<br> - No.<br> Ever?<br> - No.<br> You never want to get married?<br> - Nope.<br> Never want kids?<br> - Not a chance.<br> Ever?<br> - Never.<br> Is that so bizarre?<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, it is.<br> - I just don't see the value in it.<br> Right, sell it to me.<br> - What?<br> Sell me marriage.<br> OK, how about love?<br> - OK.<br> Stability, just somebody you can count on...<br> - How many stable marriages do you know?<br> Somebody to talk to,<br> someone to spend your life with.<br> I'm surrounded by people to talk to.<br> I doubt that's gonna change.<br> How about just not dying alone?<br> Starting when I was 12, we moved each one<br> of my grandparents into a nursing facility.<br> My parents went the same way.<br> Make no mistake, we all die alone.<br> Now, those cult members in San Diego,<br> with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers...<br> they didn't die alone.<br> I'm just saying there are options.<br> Oh, fuck.<br> Brian left me.<br> All right.<br> OK. Ok. All right.<br> All right. Shh, shh.<br> Natalie, this is Alex, my friend.<br> This is Natalie.<br> I should give you both a moment.<br> No. No, that's fine.<br> I'm fine. It's a pleasure to meet you.<br> Maybe we should just all<br> go up to our rooms and freshen up.<br> Maybe a drink?<br> - Now you're talking.<br> He broke up with you<br> with a text message?<br> It's kind of like firing someone<br> over the internet.<br> What a weaselly prick.<br> - Yeah, but what does that make me?<br> Someone who falls for a prick.<br> - We all fall for them.<br> Pricks are spontaneous,<br> they're unpredictable and they're fun.<br> Then we're surprised<br> when they turn out to be pricks.<br> I followed him to Omaha.<br> - You did?<br> I had a job waiting for me in San Francisco<br> when he got an offer from ConAgra.<br> He said we could start a life together.<br> So I followed him.<br> - To Nebraska?<br> I thought I'd be engaged by now.<br> No offense.<br> None taken.<br> - That's all right.<br> When I was 16,<br> I thought by 23 I'd be married,<br> maybe have a kid, corner office by day,<br> entertaining at night.<br> I was supposed to be driving<br> a Grand Cherokee by now.<br> Life can underwhelm you that way.<br> I mean, where did you<br> think you'd be by um...<br> It doesn't work that way.<br> - At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.<br> It can be a little counterproductive.<br> I don't want to say anything<br> that's anti-feminist.<br> I really appreciate evrything that<br> your generation did for me.<br> It was our pleasure.<br> - Well done.<br> But sometimes it feels like,<br> no matter how much success I have,<br> it's not gonna matter<br> until I find the right guy.<br> You really thought<br> this guy was the one?<br> I could have made it work.<br> He um... He really fit the bill.<br> You know?<br> - The bill?<br> White collar, college grad.<br> Loves dogs, likes funny movies.<br> Six-foot-one, brown hair, kind eyes,<br> works in finance but is outdoorsy...<br> you know, on the weekends.<br> I always imagined he'd have a single<br> syllable name like Matt or John...<br> or Dave.<br> In a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner, and<br> and the only thing he loves<br> more than me is his Golden Lab.<br> And a nice smile.<br> What about you?<br> - Let me think.<br> You know, honestly, by the time you're 34, all the<br> physical requirements just go out the window.<br> Like you secretly pray<br> that he'll be taller than you.<br> Not an asshole would be nice. Just someone who<br> enjoys my company, comes from a good family.<br> You don't think about that<br> when you're younger.<br> I don't know...<br> someone who wants kids.<br> Likes kids. Wants kids<br> Healthy enough to play with his kids.<br> Please let him earn more money<br> than I do.<br> You might not understand that now,<br> but believe me, you will one day.<br> Otherwise that's a recipe for disaster.<br> And hopefully some hair on his head.<br> But I mean even that's not<br> a deal breaker these days.<br> A nice smile.<br> Yeah, a nice smile.<br> Nice smile just might do it.<br> Wow, that was depressing.<br> I should just date women.<br> - Tried it.<br> We're no picnic ourselves.<br> I don't mind being married<br> to my career.<br> And I don't expect it to hold me in bed<br> as I fall asleep.<br> I just don't want to settle.<br> You're young. Right now you see<br> settling as some sort of a failure.<br> It is...by definition.<br> Yeah, but by the time someone is right<br> for you, it won't feel like settling.<br> And the only person left to judge you<br> will be the 23-year-old girl<br> with a target on your back.<br> So what's the plan for the evening?<br> Well, we were gonna hit that party<br> for the tech conference at the hotel.<br> I didn't know you could just attend<br> those. I thought you had to be registered.<br> Technically,<br> I don't think it's open to the public.<br> Stop by.<br> - You're gonna crash it?<br> Wel, they throw a pretty nice party,<br> have a good time, usually.<br> - No, no, I get it. I'm in.<br> Jennifer Chu?<br> Shit!<br> - Ah, it'll be fine.<br> Doing all right?<br> Yeah. This was a great idea.<br> You're so pretty.<br> You're exactly<br> what I wanna look like in 15 years.<br> Thank you, Natalie.<br> - You should dance.<br> Come on.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Come on.<br> - Oh!<br> I'm Dave.<br> - I'm Natalie.<br> Who's Jennifer?<br> I don't know.<br> How's everybody doing out there?<br> Right about now, give it up<br> for a very special alphaTECH guest.<br> Young MC!<br> What's up, alphaTECH?<br> I got a busted computer at home.<br> Can somebody fix it for me?<br> I want you to have a key to my place.<br> Wow. I had no idea we were<br> at that point in our relationship.<br> Oh, yes.<br> - Wow.<br> Where is she?<br> Back home I don't get to act the way<br> I do with you.<br> That's why I don't have a back home.<br> - I know.<br> You're so cool.<br> Mr Empty Backpack.<br> You know about my backpack?<br> - I Googled you.<br> You did?<br> It's what us modern girls do<br> when we have a crush.<br> Does it bother you?<br> - It depends.<br> Is the bag empty because you hate people or<br> because you hate the baggage that they come along with?<br> I don't hate people.<br> I'm not exactly a hermit.<br> You just don't want to be tied down<br> with the whole responsibility thing.<br> I don't know what<br> originally sparked the backpack.<br> Probably needed to be alone.<br> Recently, I've been thinking<br> that I needed to empty the backpack<br> before I know what to put back in it.<br> Oh, no!<br> - I think we're out of gas.<br> Hey. You're up.<br> I have to fly standby<br> and make a meeting in Cincinnati.<br> I made you feel cheap.<br> It's all right.<br> Just leave the money on the dresser.<br> I'll text you later<br> so we can swap schedules.<br> I really like you.<br> I like you too.<br> - Good.<br> Go catch your plane.<br> Last night uh...<br> It was kind of out of hand.<br> I said things um...<br> I'm not actually sure<br> everything that I said.<br> But I didn't want you to think...<br> - Just relax.<br> It was nice to see you cut loose.<br> Did you wake him up or slip out?<br> What?<br> - This morning. Your new friend.<br> Did you wake him up<br> for an awkward goodbye, or did you<br> just slip out<br> and make him feel like a whore?<br> I just left.<br> - Protocol's always tricky.<br> What happened to Alex?<br> She had to leave town early<br> to get to a meeting.<br> That's too bad. Where does she live?<br> - Chicago.<br> Thinking of going to see her?<br> We don't really have that<br> kind of relationship. Try it over there.<br> What um...<br> kind of relationship do you have?<br> Well, you know...casual.<br> Sounds pretty special.<br> - It works for us.<br> Do you think there's a future there?<br> I never really thought about it.<br> What's going on here?<br> Really never thought about it?<br> - No.<br> How can you not think about that?<br> How does it not cross your mind that<br> you might want a future with someone?<br> It's simple. You know that moment<br> when you look into somebody's eyes<br> and you can feel them staring into your soul and<br> the whole world goes quiet just for a second?<br> Yes.<br> - Right. Well, I don't.<br> You're an asshole.<br> No. I'm just dicking around. Come on. Give me a hand.<br> - Don't you think it's worth giving her a chance?<br> A chance for what?<br> - A chance at something real.<br> Natalie, your definition of real<br> will evolve as you get older.<br> Can you stop condescending for one second<br> or is thta one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy?<br> Bullshit philosophy?<br> - The isolation, the travelling.<br> Is that supposed to be charming?<br> - No, it's simply a life choice.<br> It's a cocoon of self-banishment.<br> - Wow. Big words.<br> Screw you.<br> - Ahh, screw you, too.<br> You have set up a way of life that basically makes it<br> impossible for you to have any human connection.<br> And now this woman comes along andsomehow<br> runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous life choice,<br> and comes out on the other end smiling<br> just so you can call her "casual"?<br> I need to grow up?<br> You're a 12-year-old.<br> I don't have a gauntlet...<br> Now listen, these Detroit guys can be tough.<br> They've been getting hammered.<br> So you don't get distracted.<br> Stick with the simple stuff.<br> Get these packets in their hands<br> and get them out the door, OK?<br> Hey, welcome to Detroit.<br> What's going on here?<br> I've been looking at those great numbers over the last few days.<br> I thought we should nut up and give this a try.<br> We could use a little more time.<br> Well, you gotta leave the nest at some point, huh?<br> This a real company, Craig.<br> We're here to do some damage.<br> I know. It's a good thing we brought<br> our best. Okay, let's stop screwing around.<br> Just give me a minute to prepare<br> and get my things together.<br> I was thinking that Natalie<br> was going to take this one.<br> She's hardly ready for that.<br> I've been watching her results<br> the last few days. She's great.<br> This is a whole other animal.<br> You know, she created it and everything, right?<br> Natalie, are you not up for it?<br> Yeah, I'm game.<br> That's my girl.<br> Just remember, don't apologize,<br> don't tell them how hard this is for you.<br> Today's one of the worst days they're ever gonna<br> have in their life. How we feel doesn't even compare.<br> Got it.<br> - Just keep it professional. You'll be fine.<br> What's all this? What's going on?<br> Hello, Mr Samuels.<br> I wish I were here with better news.<br> However, your position here<br> at Wertheimer's is no longer available.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You've been let go.<br> Just like that?<br> Who are you?<br> My name is Miss Keener and I'm here<br> today to talk about your options.<br> I worked for this company for 17 years<br> and they send a 4th-grader to can me?<br> What the fuck is this?<br> It's perfectly normal to be upset.<br> However, the sooner you can<br> tell yourself that greater opportunities...<br> Greater opportunities?<br> I'm 57 fucking years old.<br> Anybody who ever built an empire or<br> changed the world sat where you are now.<br> And it's because they sat there<br> that they were able to do it.<br> There's a packet in front of you. I want<br> you to take some time and review it.<br> All the answers you're looking for<br> are inside those pages.<br> The sooner you trust the process, the sooner<br> the next step of your life will unveil itself.<br> I need you to go back to your office now<br> and put together your personal things.<br> Mr Samuels,<br> that's all we can discuss now.<br> Mr Samuels.<br> Mr Samuels.<br> Mr Samuels!<br> You did good.<br> You OK? You want me to take over?<br> No, I'm all right.<br> Look, we just got here. That's one place.<br> I think we need to try a few more.<br> Maybe it doesn't make a difference, but it's<br> comforting to know we're in the next room.<br> I know you don't give a shit<br> about my ...<br> I think we could try a few more,<br> that's all I'm saying.<br> Fine.<br> All right. OK. All right.<br> He thought you did a great job.<br> You did.<br> I'm real proud of you.<br> - Thanks.<br> They're pulling us off the road.<br> We're going home.<br> Really? For good?<br> - Yeah.<br> Good job.<br> I'm sorry what I said about Alex.<br> That was out of line.<br> It's all right. I understand.<br> I mean, who am I to be doling out<br> relationship advice, right?<br> No kidding.<br> Are you gonna be OK?<br> What do you mean?<br> - In Omaha?<br> I don't know.<br> It's better than you think.<br> Ryan.<br> Ryan. Where are you going?<br> - I'm grabbing another flight.<br> Something I've got to take care of.<br> I'll see you back at ... home.<br> OK, just walk it in a little.<br> A little more.<br> Yeah.<br> Got it.<br> They're a cute couple.<br> You think so?<br> - Yeah, they'll make cute kids.<br> How do you like Wisconsin<br> in February?<br> I like it if you're there.<br> I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.<br> Northern Wisconsin.<br> What are you doing this weekend?<br> No.<br> - What, I haven't...<br> You want me to be your date?<br> - Yeah. Yeah.<br> At your sister's wedding?<br> - It's not like I know her that well.<br> Look, I'm not the wedding type, right?<br> But for the first time in my life I don't<br> want to be that guy alone at a bar.<br> I want a dance partner,<br> I want a "plus one."<br> And if you can stomach it,<br> I'd like it to be you.<br> Excuse me. Are you available?<br> This line's for members<br> of our Matterhorn Program.<br> Hey...Ryan.<br> Hey.<br> - Kara. Hi.<br> Alex, this is my sister Kara.<br> - Hi.<br> Well, hello.<br> Ryan's told me nothing about you.<br> So you two are dating?<br> Not exactly.<br> - Well, hey, don't worry about it.<br> We're all getting a little old<br> to be calling someone girlfriend.<br> I remember when Mom<br> used to call Jack her boyfriend.<br> Drove me up the wall.<br> Boyfriends are for kids, right?<br> So what are you doing at the hotel?<br> Yeah, OK, uh...Frank and I<br> are trying out a trial separation.<br> I'm sorry. So you're not staying at the house?<br> - No, there was a room on hold here,<br> so I thought I'd just take it for the weekend.<br> So the rehearsal dinner?<br> - Oh yeah, tonight. I'll see you there.<br> Nice digs.<br> There's a packet.<br> Hey, look who's here.<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Ryan!<br> - Hey.<br> Oh, you must be Alex.<br> - Yes, I am. Hi. How are you?<br> You are so beautiful. Kara was right.<br> Gosh. You look so grown-up.<br> I do?<br> You're the one that's getting married.<br> Oh, I know, right?<br> Oh. You haven't even seen my ring.<br> Oh, look at that.<br> - Oh, it's lovely.<br> Jim designed it.<br> Hey, Jim.<br> Hey.<br> - How's it going?<br> Hey. I'm Ryan.<br> - Jim. Good to meet you.<br> Alex. Pleasure.<br> - Pleasure.<br> Thank you, guys, for coming.<br> Brother!<br> It's true, though.<br> - Yeah, it's crazy.<br> I got the pictures you asked me to get.<br> - You can just put them right there.<br> Yeah, OK.<br> You got so many of them up there,<br> I almost didn't have room.<br> I know.<br> It's so great, everyone just chipped in.<br> What gave you the idea<br> to do something so...<br> Substantial.<br> - Well...<br> Jim has a lot of our nest egg<br> invested in this real estate venture.<br> Mm-hm. It's a real estate investment.<br> It's exciting,<br> but we went over our finances and...<br> A honeymoon just kinda at this state in the game<br> doesn't really seem affordable.<br> So, you know, we just thought,<br> just because we can't travel<br> doesn't mean we can't have pictures.<br> I think that's a fabulous idea.<br> - Yeah, it's a good one.<br> The concept is turnkey everything.<br> You buy a maintenance contract when you<br> get the home. We'll whack your weeds,<br> we'll change your light bulbs. Furniture - you can bring<br> your own or else you can pick one of our beautiful packages.<br> Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks.<br> - Nice.<br> We all need a place to call our own.<br> This is America. This is what we were promised.<br> It's a nice touch.<br> - What?<br> The bit at the end about the promise.<br> I like that part.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> You uh...you still renting that one bedroom?<br> - No. I gave it up.<br> So you own now?<br> - No.<br> But you're looking?<br> No, not really.<br> So you're just good?<br> I'm good.<br> - Well, that's good.<br> Can you believe it's tomorrow?<br> How are you gonna sleep?<br> I don't know.<br> Well, do you want some Xanax?<br> - I don't think that's for sleeping.<br> Yeah. No, I think I'll just have<br> a glass of warm milk.<br> That would do the trick.<br> - OK. See you tomorrow.<br> There's another box inside.<br> I'll grab it.<br> - You sure?<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> Jim seems like a good guy.<br> - Yeah, isn't he great?<br> He's going to make a great husband.<br> You know, Julie, I was thinking,<br> you know, with Dad not being here, um...<br> I was wondering if you had anybody<br> to walk you down the aisle.<br> No, Jim's uncle is gonna do it.<br> - He's been really supportive.<br> He's been great.<br> Well, good. That's great.<br> I just wanted to make sure that you...<br> I wanted you to be covered, that's all.<br> So, I should be there, what?<br> The other guests are arriving around<br> five and things get going at five-thirty so...<br> around then.<br> - OK.<br> Oh. Let me...<br> I'm gonna help you with those.<br> Got it.<br> It's OK. It's OK, it's OK.<br> None of that was here.<br> This is all new.<br> Really?<br> Is that all you got?<br> - What?<br> Give me a boost.<br> Watch...<br> Hang on.<br> I took geography in here.<br> You ever fool around<br> with one of your teachers?<br> No. Did you?<br> - No. Not until college.<br> That's me on the right.<br> It's kinda hard to tell.<br> - You can tell by the eyebrows.<br> You played basketball?<br> - I was a point guard. Don't act so surprised.<br> I didn't know you were such a jock.<br> That's me too.<br> And that.<br> My first fight.<br> - How'd it go?<br> Got my ass kicked.<br> This is where we used to go to make out.<br> - Oh, yes. Yep. This is very romantic.<br> I'm really happy I came here.<br> - So am I.<br> It's Kara.<br> Ryan, where are you?<br> We're having a meltdown here.<br> What's going on? What happened?<br> It's Jim. Can you get back here?<br> We need your help.<br> OK.<br> We gotta go.<br> I'll grab your suit.<br> - Thanks.<br> What happened?<br> - Jim's got cold feet.<br> Today?<br> - Yeah, that's how cold feet work.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> - Talk to him.<br> You want me to talk to him?<br> - Hey, it's either you or me.<br> You know my track record.<br> I've already struck out once.<br> I haven't been to bat.<br> I haven't been in the dugout.<br> Don't you talk for a living?<br> Motivational type stuff?<br> I tell people how to avoid commitment.<br> What kind of fucked up message is that?<br> - It's a philosophy.<br> - It's stupid.<br> Hey, it could have helped you.<br> - Ryan.<br> You haven't been around much.<br> Fuck - basically, you don't exist to us.<br> I know you wanna be there for her.<br> Well, here it is. This is your chance.<br> Hey. What's up, Ryan?<br> Jim.<br> - You ever read this before?<br> Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.<br> - I'll say.<br> Uh...Kara mentioned that you were<br> having some thoughts.<br> I don't think I'm going to be able to uh...<br> to do this.<br> Why would you say that...today?<br> Well, last night I was just kinda laying<br> in bed and I couldn't get to sleep.<br> So I started thinking about the wedding<br> and the ceremony,<br> and about our buying a house<br> and moving in together.<br> And having a kid,<br> and having another kid and then<br> Christmas and Thanksgiving<br> and spring break.<br> Going to football games, and then<br> all of a sudden they're graduating.<br> They're getting jobs, they're getting married.<br> And, you know, I'm a grandparent.<br> And then I'm retired.<br> I'm losing my hair, I'm getting fat.<br> And then the next thing you know<br> I'm dead.<br> I'm just, like...I can't stop from thinking,<br> what's the point?<br> I mean, what is the point?<br> The point?<br> - What am I starting here?<br> Jim, it's...marriage.<br> It's one of the most beautiful things on earth.<br> It's what people aspire to.<br> You never got married.<br> - That's true.<br> I mean, you never even tried.<br> - Well, it's hard to define try.<br> I don't know, just you seem happier<br> than all my married friends.<br> Look, Jim, I'm not going to lie to you.<br> Marriage can be a pain in the ass.<br> And you're kinda right. This all is just stuff<br> that leads to your eventual demise.<br> Yes.<br> - And we're all on running clocks.<br> And they can't be slowed down<br> or paused.<br> And...we all end up in the same place.<br> - yeah.<br> There is no point.<br> - There is no point. That's what I'm saying.<br> You know, uh...<br> I'm not normally the guy<br> you would talk to about stuff like this.<br> If you think about it...<br> your favorite memories, the most<br> important moments in your life.<br> Were you alone?<br> No, I guess not.<br> Come to think of it,<br> last night, the night before your wedding<br> when all this shit is swirling around in your head,<br> weren't you guys sleeping in separate bedrooms?<br> Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment and<br> I was just by myself in the honeymoon suite.<br> Kinda lonely, huh?<br> - Yes, it was pretty lonely.<br> Life's better with company.<br> Yeah...<br> - Everybody needs a co-pilot.<br> That was a nice touch.<br> - Thanks.<br> So uh... what's the mood like out there?<br> - It's not good.<br> She's pretty pissed?<br> - Just upset.<br> What should I do?<br> Go get her.<br> I'm such a fuck-up.<br> I love you so much.<br> Will you be my co-pilot?<br> Yes. Yes.<br> Welcome home.<br> OK, this is your stop.<br> When am I gonna see you?<br> - You're just gonna have to come visit.<br> Oh...so settled.<br> You're not gonna change on me, are you?<br> - No. Same guy. Just one address.<br> This is your final boarding call for<br> American Airlines Flight 3972 to Chicago.<br> Right. Call me when you get lonely.<br> I'm lonely.<br> Some guy sits down in a conference room somewhere<br> and our server routes his session<br> to one of our termination engineers.<br> "Termination engineers"? Really?<br> I preferred "terminators"<br> but it bumped with Legal.<br> Can't imagine why.<br> They follow a workflow that takes them through anything<br> from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor.<br> What are they doing now, practicing?<br> Beta testing, role-playing.<br> We go live at the end of the month.<br> Kyle, you're running through the events<br> too quickly.<br> You need to give them time to acknowledge<br> each statement. Okay? It's a legal thing.<br> Ryan?<br> - Mm? Oh. Yeah. There's more?<br> This is ridiculous.<br> Legal's starting to come hard<br> at me on this term "terminate"...<br> Ladies and gentlemen. Put your hands<br> together for today's challenge speaker,<br> Mr Ryan Bingham<br> Go get 'em.<br> Last year I flew 350,000 miles.<br> The moon is 250.<br> I want you to imagine for a second<br> that you're carrying a backpack.<br> I want you to feel the straps<br> on your shoulders<br> You feel 'em?<br> Now I want you to pack it with<br> all the stuff that you have in your life.<br> Start with the little things -<br> the things on shelves and in drawers.<br> Excuse me.<br> What the fuck are you ...<br> Relax. We'll have<br> your next guest out in one sec.<br> Hey, you gotta sign.<br> - OK.<br> OK, thank you.<br> Hey, you forgot to give me<br> your Hertz No.1 Gold Card!<br> So I was in the neighborhood.<br> Hey, honey, who's at the door?<br> - It was just somebody who was lost.<br> Alex?<br> What were you thinking,<br> showing up at my door like that?<br> What do you mean? I wanted to see you.<br> I didn't know you had a family.<br> Why didn't you tell me that?<br> Sorry I ruined your evening but you could<br> have seriously screwed things up for me.<br> That's my family. That's my real life.<br> I thought I was a part of your real life.<br> I thought we signed up<br> for the same thing.<br> Try and help me understand exactly<br> what it is that you signed up for.<br> I thought our relationship<br> was perfectly clear. I mean...<br> you are an escape.<br> You're a break from our normal lives,<br> you're a...<br> a parenthesis.<br> I'm a parenthesis?<br> I mean...<br> what do you want?<br> Tell me what you want.<br> You don't even know what you want.<br> Ryan, I'm a grown-up, OK?<br> So if you would like to see me again,<br> then ... then give me a call.<br> OK?<br> Ladies and gentlemen, we<br> have a special announcement to make.<br> Our pilot has just informed me that we<br> are passing over the city of Dubuque,<br> which might not mean much to most of you,<br> but means a lot to one of our flyers today.<br> Oh, no.<br> - because he just hit 10 million miles!<br> Congratulations.<br> - Such an amazing accomplishment.<br> You must be very very excited.<br> Hi, Captain.<br> - Captain.<br> That seat taken?<br> No. No.<br> You're the youngest yet to hit 10 mil.<br> Don't know where you found the time.<br> Yeah.<br> I don't know.<br> Here you go.<br> Seventh card we've made.<br> Small club.<br> We really appreciate your loyalty.<br> You know how many times<br> I thought about this moment?<br> Played out the conversation<br> that you and I would have right here.<br> Really?<br> What did you want to say?<br> You know, I don't remember.<br> That's all right.<br> It happens to all of us.<br> Where are you from?<br> I'm from here.<br> Hello, Mr Bingham.<br> How did you know it was me?<br> This is your dedicated line. We reserve them<br> for our most loyal and appreciated flyers.<br> I'd like to transfer some of my miles.<br> Can I open up an account to Jim and Julie Miller?<br> Certainly. How many miles<br> would you like to transfer?<br> How many miles does it take<br> to circle the globe?<br> We have our round-the-world tickets.<br> They're 500,000 miles each.<br> That'd be fine.<br> - Got a second?<br> I'll call you back.<br> What the hell happened to you yesterday?<br> I was trying to get hold of you all day.<br> I was ... some personal stuff.<br> What's going on?<br> Do you remember Karen Barnes,<br> part of a 30-person reduction<br> a few weeks back in Wichita?<br> Natalie fired her.<br> - Fired dozens of people a day. I...<br> She killed herself - jumped off a bridge.<br> Fuck.<br> I need to know if you remember<br> any woman that gave you any signals,<br> depression...<br> - They're all depressed. We're firing them.<br> Hey, I need to ask you this stuff, OK?<br> - No, I don't remember anything.<br> You never think that they're...<br> You don't remember any woman<br> that gave you any signals?<br> Anything at all, Ryan?<br> - No, nothing stands out.<br> Is Natalie all right?<br> - Natalie quit.<br> She quit?<br> - Text message.<br> Fucking nice, right?<br> No one's got any manners any more.<br> Did she say where she was going?<br> - No. She was a little upset.<br> I should give her a call.<br> I need you back in the air.<br> Hey. Did you hear what I said?<br> I thought you'd be thrilled about that.<br> It's fine. What about<br> the videoconferencing?<br> CTC is going to pause the new media front.<br> They're gonna give it some more thought.<br> We are gonna get our workhorses back<br> in the air doing what they do best, OK?<br> How long are you sending me out?<br> We're gonna let you sail and sail.<br> You send us a postcard if you ever get there.<br> So what happened?<br> How exactly do you mean?<br> You graduated top of your class.<br> You seemed to have your pick of<br> employment, including right here.<br> Instead you went to Omaha<br> to fire people for a living?<br> It's challenging work.<br> - I'll say!<br> I can't imagine doing that,<br> day in, day out.<br> Not in this climate.<br> I followed a boy.<br> I guess everybody does that<br> at one point or another.<br> This guy says I'd be lucky to have you.<br> To whom it may concern.<br> I can't even count the number<br> of people I've fired in my lifetime.<br> So many that I've actually forgotten<br> what it's like to hire somebody.<br> We've never met, but I know you'd<br> be lucky to have Natalie Keener.<br> My advice?<br> Take her and don't look back.<br> She'll be the best decision<br> you've made in a long time.<br> I sure hope he's right.<br> Well, I don't have a lot of hope,<br> and I really don't know<br> when it's gonna get better.<br> There's a lot of people unemployed.<br> And I really don't know when there's<br> gonna be light at the end of the tunnel.<br> I can't find much to talk about.<br> Talk about being proud.<br> I'm proud of my kids.<br> I think the anger comes from the fact<br> that I just wasn't needed any more.<br> I would say, you know, uh...<br> without my friends and my family,<br> I wouldn't have made it.<br> It would have been a lot tougher<br> if I would have had to make it on my own.<br> When I wake up in the morning<br> and I look over and I see my wife,<br> that gives me the sense of purpose.<br> It's not all about the money.<br> Money can keep you warm.<br> It pays your heating bills.<br> It can buy you a blanket.<br> But it doesn't keep you as warm<br> as when my husband holds me.<br> Let me get up. Let me get out.<br> Let me find something.<br> So my kids are my purpose.<br> My family.<br> Tonight most people will be welcomed<br> home by jumping dogs and squealing kids.<br> Their spouses will ask about their day<br> and tonight they'll sleep.<br> The stars will wheel forth<br> from their daytime hiding places.<br> And one of those lights,<br> slightly brighter than the rest,<br> will be my wing tip passing over.<br> Hi, Jason. My name is Kevin.<br> And I recently lost my job.<br> I wrote this song as sort of<br> a statement about uncertainty<br> and having a certain amount of anxiety<br> about the future.<br> So maybe you can use it in your movie.<br>
