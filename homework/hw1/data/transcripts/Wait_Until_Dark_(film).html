Come on.<br> You think the place is bugged?<br> -You want something?<br> -You, Mr. Talman.<br> And you too, Sgt. Carlino.<br> l want you too.<br> ln fact, l want both of you,<br> and l've come here to buy you.<br> Sgt. Carlino, if you'd<br> just shut that door, please.<br> Don't call me "sergeant."<br> Why? Are you a touchy man?<br> -Just don't call me "sergeant."<br> -No matter. Sit. Sit.<br> We'll have a little chat.<br> -We'll start with, who are you?<br> -l'm Harry Roat Jr. From Scarsdale.<br> Scarsdale?<br> Well, now, may we have<br> weapons on the table?<br> We'll have explanations first.<br> Well, this goes back a little.<br> -So go back a little.<br> -Alrighty.<br> Once upon a time...<br> ...there was a fairy princess<br> named Lisa.<br> And she had two very good friends,<br> who shall remain nameless.<br> Now, these three were fond of performing<br> little dramas for select audiences.<br> Their most memorable performances<br> were that of outraged husband...<br> ...and detective breaking in upon<br> guilty wife in the arms of her lover...<br> ...or vice versa.<br> They were adaptable.<br> The detective, it's worth mentioning, was<br> particularly convincing in his performance...<br> ...but then he had had the benefit<br> of previous on-the-job training.<br> -Man, you're a charmer.<br> -Thank you.<br> Things went trippingly<br> for our three heroes...<br> ...until one day, a certain stockbroker,<br> a Charles F. Parker, wasn't it? Got nasty.<br> And then our poor heroes went to jail,<br> or two of them did.<br> Lisa, well....<br> Well, she....<br> She escaped.<br> What's the point?<br> Lisa would like to do something<br> for her two friends...<br> ...now that they're back<br> in circulation again.<br> -What does she want?<br> -A doll...<br> ...for which she will pay handsomely.<br> Now may we have weapons on the table?<br> -l'm clean.<br> -Scout's honor?<br> Lisa says you favor brass, sergeant.<br> That pocket looks a little lumpy.<br> l cannot negotiate in an atmosphere<br> of mistrust.<br> Why, you?<br> -And, you, what's your favorite toy?<br> -Geraldine.<br> What does she do?<br> -May we have Geraldine on the table too?<br> -No, we may not.<br> -Why the hell not?<br> -Because she's the referee.<br> Now, Lisa will pay you $2000 each<br> for a couple hours work.<br> lnterested?<br> What kind of work?<br> Finding Lisa's doll.<br> -Are you serious?<br> -l am.<br> -What kind of doll?<br> -An ordinary doll, a child's doll.<br> What's in it?<br> -Do we hurt anybody?<br> -Not a fly.<br> -Do you care?<br> -No.<br> -What do you think?<br> -What's to think? He's a creep.<br> Yeah, baby. Not like us, huh?<br> We want an advance.<br> Lisa and l thought more like 500 each.<br> Why so generous?<br> So you don't ask what's in the doll.<br> So now we know what's in the doll.<br> Well, win one, lose one.<br> lt's all straight.<br> What do we do?<br> What you always do, Mr. Talman,<br> lie and cheat and play-act.<br> -Go on.<br> -Lisa gave the doll to a man named Hendrix.<br> She met him on the plane from Montreal.<br> Lisa's friendly.<br> Why?<br> Somebody waiting for her,<br> she hadn't expected...<br> ...so Hendrix brought it home here.<br> Hendrix? Who's he?<br> He's...nobody.<br> Mr. Clean. A photographer.<br> Looks like he has a wife. Where's she?<br> Out.<br> She goes to school.<br> Come on. This is a hell of a place<br> to be talking.<br> Don't panic, sergeant.<br> -Why not?<br> -Because it's arranged. lt's all arranged.<br> By you?<br> Photographer Hendrix is in his studio<br> waiting to photograph a certain Miss Lejiana.<br> But a little while ago,<br> her male secretary phoned...<br> ...very efficient, very humble,<br> grovelingly polite...<br> ...to say that she had been delayed.<br> -He's terrific.<br> -Last night, Lisa called up about the doll...<br> ...but Mr. Hendrix couldn't find it.<br> He looked all over for it,<br> but he couldn't find it.<br> Doesn't that strike you odd?<br> lt strikes me odd too, Mr. Talman.<br> -Was he lying?<br> -l don't know, but we're gonna find out.<br> Now, look around.<br> Familiarize yourself with the place.<br> We're coming back here tomorrow.<br> And the doll is here, you're sure?<br> Lisa and l checked earlier.<br> We didn't see it. lt's here, though.<br> Did you look in here?<br> Well, anyway, we don't work safes.<br> l know, but you talk, and that's why<br> you've been invited to this party...<br> ...to talk your way into that big,<br> black safe, sergeant.<br> -There's a locked closet in the bedroom.<br> -Not there. Just clothes.<br> -How do you know?<br> -l looked.<br> -You got the key?<br> -lt's on the ledge above the door.<br> No, it isn't.<br> They must have taken it with them.<br> Lock the closet when they<br> don't bolt the front door?<br> They're strange people.<br> They lose dolls.<br> l think you just made a mistake.<br> l'd like the key.<br> Well, if you--<br> All right, fat man, over there.<br> Both of you through the door, backwards.<br> lf you'd only said please.<br> And now l'd like the key.<br> Please?<br> Go look.<br> Well, she was trespassing, Mike...<br> ...poaching...<br> ...going into business for herself.<br> Bad news.<br> Things like that go on,<br> what do you have?<br> Anarchy.<br> No discipline, no sense of order.<br> Bad news.<br> Out!<br> -Haven't you forgotten something?<br> -We just earned the money.<br> l mean fingerprints.<br> You just signed your names<br> all over this place.<br> Even if you could remember, it'd<br> still take you hours to wipe them up.<br> lf not days.<br> As for me...<br> ...well, l've only touched one thing<br> since l've been in here.<br> And now it's clean...<br> ...like me. No police record,<br> no known associations with Lisa.<br> Nothing, in fact.<br> l could let you go and what would happen?<br> l'd evaporate.<br> But you? Bad news.<br> Don't forget this, sarge.<br> And the icebox, don't forget the icebox.<br> Carlino, knock it off!<br> We can prove where we were<br> when this happened.<br> Oh, and when did it happen?<br> -Just before you let me in?<br> -So?<br> So if you do exactly what l tell you...<br> ...there will be no police,<br> there will be no problems.<br> Go on.<br> First, get her out of here.<br> Roll her up in this.<br> l got a van by the corner.<br> l'll bring it out front.<br> Why not the back, where<br> there's less publicity?<br> There's no back door.<br> We'll dump her where l found this.<br> Give me a hand.<br> -She'll be found.<br> -l hope so.<br> All she's got on her is a hotel key.<br> When they check...<br> ...they'll see she's Mrs. Harry Roat Jr.<br> -From Scarsdale.<br> -Right.<br> This changes things a little, you know?<br> That's what l figured.<br> We'll talk about it later.<br> No, we'll talk about it now.<br> lt was 2000 each. Now it's 4.<br> Get behind the door, and, you, back there.<br> Stay dead still.<br> She's alone. Don't breathe.<br> Sam?<br> Sam, are you here?<br> No, Susy, l'm not here.<br> Gloria?<br> -Hendrix here.<br> -Hendrix here too.<br> l called to tell you l was the best<br> in blind school today.<br> -That's my girl.<br> -l really truly was, cross my heart.<br> And I believe you.<br> So can l tap my way over to your studio?<br> Not now.<br> Some female with the unlikely name<br> of Lejiana is due any minute for a sitting.<br> Well, l'll wait for you here, then.<br> Look, I'll tell you what. Since<br> this Lejiana character is already late...<br> ...I'll just stick around<br> a few more minutes.<br> So can l come over and wait for you<br> in the coffee shop downstairs?<br> Sure.<br> Won't be hard to find me.<br> l'll be the one reading Peter Rabbit in Braille.<br> -Bye.<br> -Bye.<br> Damn it. You're supposed to be there.<br> Gloria, l know you're there.<br> Mr. Hendrix won't wait forever.<br> Shall we go to work, children?<br> Two plus two, 4000.<br> Two plus two, Mr. Talman.<br> Highly recommended.<br> Disposable, you buy them in enormous rolls...<br> ...from Hammacher Schlemmer.<br> Spread out the rug.<br> Trouble.<br> Trouble.<br> -Hi, Susy. Hey.<br> -Hi, Shatner.<br> Let me help you with that mess.<br> Oh, you're a lovely cavalier,<br> only don't tell Sam you helped me.<br> l'm supposed to be learning<br> total self-sufficiency.<br> Why don't you come down<br> for a drink tonight?<br> l can't. l'm off to Vermont for<br> a couple of days of chasing stretch pants.<br> By the way, l haven't been able<br> to get in touch with our slumlord all day.<br> And my skylight's still broken.<br> -lf you see him--<br> -We never see him.<br> He's owed us a new refrigerator since we<br> moved in, so he doesn't come around.<br> Don't let it get you down.<br> Have a good weekend.<br> On Monday, we'll form a tenants committee<br> or something jazzy like that.<br> Some committee. Me, you, Sam,<br> Gloria and her mother.<br> Oh, well.<br> -Ciao.<br> -Ciao.<br> -Susy?<br> -No, Batman.<br> -Safe to open the door?<br> -All right.<br> -You want to give me a hand, darling?<br> -Sure.<br> Who are you doing?<br> Gloria.<br> She's been after me for weeks<br> to take some pictures.<br> l promised l'd have these done.<br> l've got to go to Asbury Park--<br> -Asbury Park? l thought you--<br> -Sorry, l only found out this second.<br> That's all right. l was just<br> planning something silly.<br> -Will it hold till tomorrow?<br> -Sure.<br> Someone called from the chemical company.<br> They saw my Sunday Times spread.<br> They want me to make their new factory<br> look like the U.N.<br> Another night shot.<br> They're paying handsomely.<br> That's the last one.<br> -Can l go with you?<br> -Sure, but l'll--<br> Be home much quicker if you don't.<br> You know there was a murder<br> around here last night?<br> They found the body this morning.<br> A lady from Scarsdale.<br> l heard it on the radio.<br> So?<br> What if l get chopped up in little pieces<br> and dumped in the river?<br> Little tiny pieces that nobody<br> could ever recognize...<br> ...as having been a poor,<br> defenseless, blind lady...<br> ...whose husband was off in Asbury Park.<br> -You're not listening, Sammy.<br> -Sure l am.<br> Why don't we have some light<br> around here?<br> They're always finding bodies in New York.<br> Not in the parking lot<br> practically next door, they don't.<br> -You're making it up, Susy.<br> -No, l'm not. l promise.<br> l told you l heard it on the radio.<br> Really, l did.<br> Come on, Susy.<br> The police don't have<br> the first notion who did it.<br> Pretty spooky, don't you think, Sammy?<br> Tell you what l think.<br> l think it's a ploy to make me stay home.<br> Well, there was a murdered woman<br> found from Scarsdale...<br> ...and that's a true fact.<br> And you're afraid for your life,<br> that's a true fact?<br> No, but it was worth a try.<br> Fourteen.<br> -You sure he'll go?<br> -Yeah.<br> -He'd better hurry or he'll miss the bus.<br> -He's got time.<br> This is some day for a schlep<br> out to Asbury Park.<br> -When does your bus leave?<br> -Five.<br> Time for another cup of coffee?<br> Maybe half a cup.<br> lf that doll woman calls,<br> tell her l haven't found it yet.<br> Let Gloria look around for it while she's<br> down here. lt must be somewhere.<br> l don't want Gloria today.<br> l don't need her.<br> -Yes, you do, for your shopping.<br> -No Gloria!<br> -Give me a hint?<br> -You can find it by yourself.<br> lf you couldn't, l'd tell you.<br> -What have you got against Gloria?<br> -A lot.<br> The problem is, she's in love with you,<br> which makes me the villain.<br> Susy, she's a kid.<br> More to your left, in front of you.<br> l'd rather have a dog.<br> Dogs can't shop at the supermarket.<br> They can't rearrange the furniture either<br> so l trip over it.<br> That's her latest hobby.<br> l nearly broke my leg last night.<br> She's been sneaking cigarettes too.<br> l smelled smoke when l came in yesterday.<br> Susy, give her a chance.<br> Her father's run off again. Her mother's<br> flitted out for a weekend uptown.<br> Poor old Gloria gets slammed around<br> like a Ping-Pong ball.<br> On top of that, she's wearing glasses.<br> Kids are giving her the treatment...<br> ...calling her the "monster from outer space."<br> lcebox needs defrosting, darling,<br> only my way this time.<br> lt's more practical.<br> Use plenty of boiling water.<br> -What if l burn both my hands off your way?<br> -Don't.<br> The Unguentine's in the emergency drawer.<br> lf the weather's okay, try walking<br> to the studio and back.<br> No cheating.<br> Do l have to be the world's<br> champion blind lady?<br> Yes!<br> Then, l will be.<br> l'll be whatever<br> you want me to be.<br> Tell me what you want,<br> and that's what l'll be.<br> -Susy--<br> -l mean it.<br> l don't want you ever<br> to be anything but Susy...<br> ...because that's the way l love you.<br> Do you? Do you?<br> What do you think?<br> -Do you want me to stay home?<br> -Yes.<br> But you can go to work anyway.<br> l'll clean up here...<br> ...then when you get back,<br> l'll be all scrubbed and polished.<br> You sure it's okay?<br> Then, l got to rush.<br> Where does the icebox plug in?<br> You'll find it.<br> No fair asking Gloria either.<br> Sam.<br> Are you looking at me?<br> -Bye, dope.<br> -Bye, dope.<br> Thanks for everything.<br> Okay, Mr. Talman,<br> it's time for your soft-shoe.<br> And remember, there's a nice, little, pink kid<br> running around the house.<br> And she wears glasses.<br> Sam.<br> Gloria!<br> Somebody!<br> Operator.<br> -Please....<br> -Fire department.<br> There's something burning.<br> l'm blind, and l can't locate it.<br> -lt's getting worse!<br> -Can I have your address?<br> Wait, l think somebody's here.<br> Come in!<br> The door's open.<br> -You all right?<br> -There's a fire.

What is this?<br> He was supposed to photograph a girl,<br> and she didn't turn up.<br> Nobody can verify he was there<br> or what he was up to?<br> Are you questioning her<br> for a reason?<br> -l'm not questioning her.<br> -Why are you taking notes?<br> l'm allowed to talk, you know.<br> Sure, but she's allowed not to.<br> She doesn't have to answer.<br> Don't they study the Constitution<br> at police school?<br> -You some lawyer?<br> -No, but l know her rights!<br> l didn't think you were.<br> Well....<br> Goodbye, Mrs. Hendrix.<br> l'll probably be back.<br> -Mike?<br> -Well, he was certainly a big help.<br> ls--? ls this room dirty?<br> No. Why?<br> The sergeant kept dusting things.<br> -Did he?<br> -Yes.<br> Over by the refrigerator and...<br> ...the banisters.<br> Here.<br> l'll get it.<br> Sergeant probably forgot his badge.<br> Forgive me for bursting in on you<br> like this, Mr. Hunt.<br> No. Mr. and Mrs. Hendrix live here.<br> Hendrix. Oh, l'm terribly sorry...<br> ...but is this 27B Saint Luke's Place?<br> l'm Mrs. Hendrix. Can l help you?<br> My name is Roat. Harry Roat Jr.<br> What is it, Susy?<br> -Mr. Roat, Mrs. Hendrix is blind.<br> -Oh, l see.<br> l'm sorry for intruding upon you<br> and Mr. Hendrix--<br> -No, my name's Talman.<br> -Yes, well, whatever.<br> Mrs. Hendrix, has my father been here?<br> -The old man?<br> -Yes, do let me explain.<br> l'm so embarrassed.<br> lt all must be just a terrible mistake.<br> He made a mess of Mrs. Hendrix's things.<br> You better straighten him out.<br> Well, he's not crazy, l assure you.<br> He's not crazy.<br> He's just very old, and he thinks<br> a photographer named Sam Hunt lives here.<br> He's very old, my father,<br> and very worried for my sake.<br> He thinks that my wife has been...<br> ...seeing this Mr. Hunt.<br> And that's why l've troubled you with my--<br> Hi, Susy, l've got the groceries.<br> Thanks, Gloria.<br> l'll put them away.<br> Okay.<br> -See you.<br> -Bye.<br> You know, you really do have<br> the wrong house, Mr. Roat.<br> -Here.<br> -We don't know anyone named Hunt.<br> l don't know this man Hunt either,<br> dear lady. May l explain?<br> Three years ago...<br> ...my wife was on vacation in Montreal<br> with my mother and father.<br> And while she was there,<br> my wife became acquainted...<br> ...my father says, with this photographer<br> named Sam Hunt.<br> Now, my father says<br> that they've been seeing each other...<br> ...from time to time ever since.<br> My wife is...<br> ...very beautiful.<br> -What is all this about, Mr. Roat?<br> -Well...<br> ...l believe my father followed my wife<br> to this apartment.<br> You're wrong.<br> You see, the other afternoon,<br> there was a big scene.<br> There were testy words<br> between my wife and my father...<br> ...and my wife stormed out of the apartment<br> with her doll.<br> Her doll?<br> Yes, the doll was what started<br> the bad words that day.<br> lt was especially made for my wife<br> in Montreal to play her favorite tune.<br> The point is that when my wife left<br> the house, my father said to me:<br> "Sam Hunt gave her that doll.<br> Do you know that?"<br> And then he ran out<br> of the house to look for her.<br> Later, my father called and said<br> he lives at 27B Saint Luke's Place...<br> ...in the basement apartment.<br> And then this morning, when l told Dad<br> that Lejiana hadn't....<br> Lejiana?<br> Yes. Lejiana, my wife.<br> When l told Dad that she hadn't<br> come home last night...<br> ...he got terribly excited<br> and drove off in my car...<br> ...so l finally decided to come here<br> on the off-chance that....<br> -Your wife didn't come home last night?<br> -That's right and--<br> Want me to get it, Susy?<br> Hello.<br> Yeah. Hang on.<br> Susy, it's that Sgt. Carlino.<br> He wants to speak to you.<br> Why?<br> -May l take a message?<br> -l'm leaving now.<br> -No, l'll take it.<br> -Forgive me for intruding.<br> Well, his son's here now.<br> Don't go. He wants to talk to you.<br> -Who? Who does?<br> -The police.<br> -Say l've gone.<br> -lt's about your wife, Mr. Roat.<br> Hello.<br> Speaking.<br> That's right. No, she didn't.<br> ln fact--<br> Was she hurt?<br> No, tell me now.<br> -Mr. Roat!<br> -Mike!<br> Oh, l'm frightened.<br> l'm very frightened.<br> Don't worry, Susy.<br> He's gone.<br> Mrs. Roat is dead.<br> She was murdered last night near here.<br> -What did you say?<br> -And the police think Sam did it.<br> -Sam?<br> -Yes. The doll.<br> The doll.<br> The one Mr. Roat Jr. described.<br> Sam brought a doll exactly like that<br> back from Canada.<br> l was trying to help him unpack from the trip<br> when something fell on the floor.<br> The something played a little tune.<br> The something was a doll!<br> Mrs. Roat's special-made, handmade,<br> made-in-Canada doll. Sam had it!<br> l thought it was a surprise<br> for me, but it wasn't.<br> lt was for a little girl in the hospital.<br> A woman at the airport<br> asked Sam to carry it for her...<br> ...so that her other girl, who was meeting<br> her, wouldn't see it and get jealous.<br> The woman called yesterday about getting<br> the doll, and Sam couldn't find it.<br> Sam never met the doll lady<br> in his life before. He told me so.<br> Don't do this to yourself, Susy.<br> Then there was the woman<br> he was supposed to photograph.<br> Sam said she didn't show up.<br> But he was away a long time<br> waiting for her.<br> And her name was Lejiana,<br> and so is Mrs. Roat's.<br> Well, suppose he did know her.<br> lt's not so serious.<br> Oh, but it is.<br> All right, then.<br> Let's say that it's serious.<br> Let's try to figure this all out.<br> From the beginning.<br> First, the old man came in screaming<br> about Sam and Mrs. Roat.<br> He went into your bedroom<br> and tore it apart.<br> He messed up your dresser.<br> Why did he do that?<br> He must have taken something, Susy.<br> He just must have.<br> Come here.<br> Now, look.<br> Check, feel around,<br> see if anything's missing.<br> Our wedding picture's gone.<br> The one of Sam and me.<br> Do you see it anywhere?<br> No.<br> That's the meanest thing l ever heard of.<br> l'm calling the police.<br> No!<br> No, Mike, we can't.<br> We mustn't say anything<br> to the police. Nothing.<br> They've got to forget all about us, Mike.<br> They think Sam did it!<br> Please.<br> What is it?<br> -That's funny.<br> -What's funny?<br> There's a police car pulling up outside.<br> They're just standing there.<br> Susy, l think they're watching this house.<br> Don't worry.<br> lt's no good, Mike.<br> What?<br> The doll. l can't find it.<br> Hold on. l just found another suitcase.<br> What?<br> l just found another suitcase.<br> Any luck?<br> Well, just some papers.<br> And some letters.<br> Well, if any of them are from Mrs. Roat,<br> don't bother to read them to me.<br> Oh, they're from you, Susy.<br> You type very well.<br> l didn't know Sam was a hoarder.<br> Listen to me. We've got to face<br> the fact that Sam's in trouble.<br> We've got to find that doll.<br> lt's the one thing that proves<br> that Sam's connected with this.<br> But it's not here.<br> We've looked for it.<br> Well, now, wait a minute.<br> You're the one who told me.<br> You said that Sam brought a doll<br> back from Canada.<br> You said it's the same doll<br> that Roat described.<br> You went right down the line<br> and told me that it proved...<br> ...that Sam and Mrs. Roat were connected.<br> And now Mrs. Roat's dead,<br> murdered right next door.<br> -Maybe l was wrong.<br> -That doesn't matter.<br> lf you thought that way,<br> the police will think that way.<br> Without the doll, it's a lot of ranting<br> and raving from those crazy Roats...<br> ...but with it,<br> the police have a case involving Sam.<br> -Mike--<br> -Do you understand?<br> Mike, did you notice how l jumped<br> when Mr. Roat Jr. came in here?<br> -Have you been listening to me?<br> -For a moment, l thought it was the old man.<br> He had on the exact same shoes<br> as his father. New shoes.<br> And one of them squeaked a little bit.<br> -You probably didn't notice.<br> -No, l didn't.<br> And another thing, it's winter.<br> -lt's dark early now, isn't it?<br> -Yes.<br> Then why has everybody been<br> playing around with the blinds?<br> -What?<br> -Mr. Roat did it.<br> And Sgt. Carlino did it too.<br> Mike.<br> ls that police car still outside?<br> l'll check and see.<br> -Yes, and they're looking this way.<br> -See their faces, the policemen in the car?<br> -Not very well. lt's pretty dark.<br> -Try. This is important.<br> -Why?<br> -ls one of the policemen Mr. Roat?<br> -ls it?<br> -No.<br> No, it isn't.<br> There'd be a radio inside a police car,<br> wouldn't there?<br> Yeah, l suppose.<br> What are you getting at?<br> Sgt. Carlino fiddles with the blinds...<br> ...and immediately, the police phone<br> and ask to speak to him.<br> Then Mr. Roat Jr. fiddles with the blinds,<br> and Carlino calls him.<br> No, l don't think the police<br> work like that. lt's too cops and robbers.<br> Mr. Roat's story and Sam's<br> don't go together.<br> And l've been forgetting something<br> very important.<br> -What's that?<br> -That l know Sam...<br> ...and l don't know Mr. Roat.<br> You've got to get this through your head.<br> lt's what the police think that counts.<br> lf we wanna help Sam,<br> we've gotta find that doll--<br> -But it isn't here! lt isn't here!<br> -lt must be!<br> -lt's got to be in this safe.<br> -But l told you, it couldn't be.<br> -And why not?<br> -Because it isn't ours. Not really.<br> The woman who had this apartment<br> wanted to sell it to us when we moved in.<br> When we convinced her that we<br> didn't want it...<br> ...she locked it and deliberately dropped<br> the key down the drain outside.<br> -Susy, you're making that up.<br> -l am not. Why should l?<br> -Be careful.<br> -Why should l?<br> On second thought, l don't suppose<br> l'd open my safe in front of a stranger.<br> Have l been treating you like a stranger?<br> l wish the doll were in the safe.<br> lt is your problem, isn't it?<br> Yours and Sam's. You have to do<br> what you think is best for him.<br> Where are you going?<br> To pick up my things at the apartment.<br> l can't miss the last plane.<br> -You said you'd stay.<br> -Sam will be home soon.<br> Will you give me a phone number?<br> What phone number?<br> Where you're going,<br> in case l find the doll.<br> l'll phone when l get there.<br> Give me the name of your friend<br> so l can call lnformation.<br> Well, yeah, l may have it<br> written down someplace.<br> -Here it is. Can you remember it?<br> -Yeah.<br> -Cl2....<br> -242. That's like ours. Go on.<br> -4598.<br> -242-4598.<br> Right.<br> Mike?<br> Thank you.<br> Five, nine.<br> -Where's Roat?<br> -Who knows?<br> Out beating up old ladies.<br> How goes it inside?<br> She's something, man.<br> She is really something.<br> Yeah.<br> You're on next. Give her a minute,<br> then push her as hard as you can.<br> Really push. Keep hinting at<br> that safe and the doll.<br> lf it's in there and she can't open it,<br> she will after you've gone.<br> What about Roat Jr. from Scarsdale?<br> Yeah. What about him?<br> Who's that?<br> lt's only me, Susy.<br> Thank goodness.<br> When l got upstairs, l found l'd left<br> a stick of butter in the bag.<br> Do you remember the man who was<br> here when you brought the groceries?<br> -Which one?<br> -Not Sam's friend. The other one.<br> -Sure.<br> -What did he look like?<br> Kind of dumb-looking, l guess.<br> -You'd recognize him, wouldn't you?<br> -Yeah.<br> Come.<br> Get up on a chair<br> and look out the window.<br> There's a police car out there. Can you<br> see the face of the man inside of it?<br> There's no police car.<br> -Are you sure?<br> -Yeah, l'm sure.<br> There's no car out there.<br> Well, yes, there is, a kind of squatty<br> truck. Right by the phone booth.<br> Phone booth?<br> ls there anyone inside the truck?<br> Well, there's a man standing near it.<br> ls it the man who was here<br> when you brought the groceries?<br> l don't think so.<br> Susy, he's coming this way.<br> Watch out. He's looking<br> through the window.<br> -Can he see you?<br> -No, but he's still looking.<br> l think he's going. He's go--<br> You had it!<br> -l was only borrowing--<br> -We've got to hide it.<br> -Where is it? Give it to me.<br> -Under your feet.<br> l was only borrowing it.<br> That's why l brought it back.<br> Where are we going to put it? ln<br> the washing machine. Come. Help me.<br> -Gloria?<br> -Yeah?<br> How would you like to do something<br> difficult and terribly dangerous?<br> -l'd love it.<br> -Can you see the phone from upstairs?<br> -From mother's bedroom, l think.<br> -Good.<br> Go upstairs and watch that phone booth.<br> Don't take your eyes off it for a second.<br> Now, if anyone from the truck<br> goes in and makes a call...<br> -...phone me as soon as they come out.<br> -Got it.<br> Just let the phone ring twice and<br> then hang up. Remember, twice.<br> -l know. Like a signal.<br> -Good girl.<br> Susy, if you need me for anything, just<br> bang on the water pipes in the corner.<br> -Who's that?<br> -Sgt. Carlino.<br> Quick, under the stairs.<br> l'll be right with you, sergeant.<br> Just a minute.<br> Coming.<br> l'm sorry to keep you waiting.<br> l'm glad you dropped by, sergeant.<br> Some children were playing out back,<br> and l think they broke a window.<br> -Would you mind taking a look?<br> -ln here?<br> l think so.<br> There's nothing broken here.<br> Well, maybe in the bathroom.<br> lt's hard for me to tell.<br> There's nothing broken anywhere.<br> Look, Mrs. Hendrix, l understand<br> Mr. Roat called on you this afternoon.<br> Yes, he was here for a moment.<br> You've been looking for something, l see.<br> l couldn't find the garbage bags.<br> No?<br> Do you know what l think?<br> You can't find that doll.<br> lt's not that. l couldn't<br> find the garbage bags.<br> No, the doll! The doll your husband<br> brought back from Canada.<br> -The doll he gave Mrs. Roat.<br> -My husband did not know Mrs. Roat.<br> l'm sorry, Mrs. Hendrix,<br> that's just not true.<br> Mr. Roat recognizes your husband<br> from a photograph his father has.<br> And old man Roat remembers seeing<br> your husband and Mrs. Roat together.<br> Now. Now, l wonder where<br> that doll can be.<br> -ln that big, black safe maybe?<br> -No, there's nothing in the safe.<br> There is no doll, and my husband<br> never knew Mrs. Roat.<br> He did, as a matter of fact, know her.<br> Now, if you don't open that safe...<br> ...l'll get a search warrant and drill it.<br> lt'll take me less than 1 0 minutes<br> and before your husband gets back.<br> -Who are you phoning?<br> -The 6th Precinct.<br> l want to speak to Mr. Roat.<br> -Operator?<br> -Wait a minute.<br> Mrs. Hendrix, l'll get him.<br> l can get through quicker.<br> -Hello?<br> -Sixth Precinct, Carlino speaking.<br> Go ahead.<br> Is Mr. Roat Jr. still there?<br> Mrs. Hendrix wants to speak to him.<br> Hold on, l'll see.<br> lt's for you, Roat Jr.<br> -Hello? This is Harry Roat Jr.<br> -Mr. Roat, this is Mrs. Hendrix.<br> My lawyer has advised me...<br> ...that if your father makes any more<br> accusations against my husband...<br> ...he will have to take immediate action.<br> Do you understand that, Mr. Roat?<br> Yes. Yes. Right.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Hendrix.<br> Thank you.<br> That lawyer friend of yours isn't<br> going to stop me, Mrs. Hendrix.<br> Be right back.

Carlino hounding me...<br> ...l could have told you earlier.<br> Okay, Susy, fine. l'll go get it.<br> Where is the studio?<br> Just two blocks away, 78 West Eighth St.<br> lt's on the top floor.<br> And the desk is in the far corner,<br> away from the window.<br> lt's a big old thing with a roller top.<br> You know the kind l mean, with<br> cubbyholes and pigeonholes and--<br> -Yeah, l know the kind you mean.<br> -lt's in the left-hand drawer, the doll.<br> Gloria said so.<br> Susy, l'm gonna ask you once more.<br> This is no time for mistakes.<br> Are you sure the little girl saw the doll?<br> Are you sure this is all true?<br> l'm saving my husband's<br> life, aren't l, Mike?<br> l'll be right back. You stay put.<br> -Make a cup of hot coffee or something.<br> -Whatever you say, Mike.<br> Susy! Susy, it's me.<br> Those men who just went out,<br> who are they?<br> -Where are they now?<br> -Careful. Two of them went up the street.<br> -The one that looked in the window--<br> -Carlino. Yes?<br> Well, he's outside.<br> Guarding or something.<br> Now...<br> ...the first thing we have to do<br> is stay calm.<br> l'm calm, Susy.<br> Yes, l know you are. l really know.<br> lt's the best thing l ever heard.<br> -Are they detectives?<br> -No, they're not detectives.<br> They're sure not detectives.<br> The one out on the street,<br> can l get by him?<br> -Not without his seeing you.<br> -Then l have to stay here.<br> -You've never really met him, have you?<br> -No.<br> Good.<br> You know the Port<br> Authority Bus Terminal?<br> lt's near 42nd Street. Take a taxi.<br> The driver will know where it is.<br> -42nd Street.<br> -Here. You'll need this.<br> What should l do?<br> Ask if the bus has arrived from<br> Asbury Park.<br> -Asbury Park. Say it.<br> -Asbury Park.<br> Meet every bus from Asbury Park.<br> Stay all night if you have to.<br> Sam will be on one of them.<br> Can you do that?<br> Of course. What shall l tell him?<br> Everything. All about the three men.<br> Sam will know what to do.<br> -As soon as you're safe, l'll call the police.<br> -Okay.<br> l wish something like this<br> would happen every day.<br> Oh, l'm a Girl Scout.<br> Wanna buy some cookies?<br> Sure you don't wanna buy<br> a few boxes? l get points.<br> Buzz off, kid.<br> Well, okay. Guess l better try to make<br> points with someone else.<br> Operator.<br> No. No.<br> Oh, no. No. No.<br> They can't. They can't.<br> They can't do this. Please, Sam! Sam!<br> Oh, God.<br> All right, all right,<br> l'll meet you in the parking lot.<br> Okay, bad man.<br> Susy?<br> Susy. lt's me, Mike.<br> How long have you known?<br> You've been to the studio, Mike.<br> -Oh, that's right.<br> -And there was no doll.<br> More fun still, there wasn't even a desk.<br> Poor Sam. He really ought<br> to have a desk.<br> But you don't know Sam<br> and about him needing a desk.<br> -Mrs. Hendrix--<br> -Susy. We're not strangers.<br> All right, Susy. Game time's over.<br> l want the doll.<br> No.<br> -l'm afraid you don't have any choice.<br> -Oh, but l do.<br> -l do have a choice.<br> -No, you don't.<br> Damn it, you act as if<br> you're in kindergarten.<br> This is the big, bad world full of mean<br> people, where nasty things happen.<br> Now you tell me.<br> Look, Susy, you listen to me,<br> and you listen to me good!<br> l'm through playing around.<br> You give me that doll,<br> and you give it to me fast!<br> Give it to me!<br> Okay, Susy.<br> You win.<br> Sam didn't kill that woman, did he,<br> Mike? He didn't even know her.<br> He met her at the airport,<br> just exactly like he told you.<br> Did you kill her, Mike?<br> -No.<br> -Mr. Roat?<br> That isn't important.<br> lt hasn't got anything to do with you<br> or with Sam. lt never did.<br> lt was a whole separate thing<br> for me and Carlino and Roat.<br> -You don't belong to any of it.<br> -lt's different with Mr. Roat, isn't it?<br> l think it's more than the doll with him.<br> He said he wants to do evil things.<br> You don't have to worry about Roat.<br> Roat's dead.<br> He didn't like us, you know. Any of us.<br> So we had to get rid of him.<br> We flipped a coin. Carlino won.<br> Anyway, it doesn't matter.<br> What are you gonna do now, Mike?<br> Disappear. Like magic.<br> You're a good, strong lady...<br> -...Susy Hendrix.<br> -World's champion blind lady.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> You're all of that.<br> -And, Susy?<br> -Yes?<br> l want you to know--<br> What is it?<br> Mike?<br> Mike!<br> What are you doing, Mr. Roat?<br> Gasoline!<br> Well, Susy--<br> Now all the children have gone<br> to bed, and we can talk.<br> -What are you gonna do with gasoline?<br> -Well, you just guess.<br> Now guess.<br> No!<br> Please, no!<br> -All right!<br> -l thought that would save time.<br> l'll get you the doll.<br> Oh, that's a good girl.<br> Go to the head of the class.<br> Mike.<br> lt's just a chair, Susy,<br> so you can sit down.<br> Did you know they wanted to kill me?<br> l did. l knew it even before they did.<br> They were awful amateurs, and that's<br> why you saw through them.<br> -l saw through you too.<br> -No, not all the way, Susy.<br> Even now, not all the way.<br> The lovely thing was the way<br> l let them set it all up.<br> All that silliness of meeting<br> in the parking lot, the whole thing.<br> They had comic-book minds, so we did<br> it their way, right until the end.<br> And then topsy-turvy.<br> Me topsy and them turvy.<br> -Where's Sam? Where did you send him?<br> -Clever, Susy.<br> -Where is he?<br> -He's on his way to Bellevue Hospital.<br> There was a message for him<br> when he got to Asbury Park.<br> One of those short, formal things.<br> Your wife has had a slight<br> accident, you know.<br> So he took the first bus<br> and is racing to your bedside.<br> So we don't have<br> too much time together.<br> -You killed that woman, that doll woman.<br> -l don't wanna talk about Mrs. Roat.<br> -Are you gonna give me that doll, Susy?<br> -l can't--<br> l don't believe you, Susy.<br> l can't! l don't have it anymore.<br> Look, what is that? Stop it!<br> Now, l'm not gonna<br> ask you again, Susy.<br> When do you wanna tell me where?<br> You're gonna tell me.<br> -l can't! lt isn't here!<br> -You're lying again.<br> -What is that?<br> -lt's just--<br> lt's just my hand.<br> Well, now.<br> Why don't we stand up?<br> l said, stand up.<br> Now, go into the bedroom.<br> Mr. Roat?<br> -Are you looking at me?<br> -Yes, Susy--<br> Stop!<br> Don't touch that!<br> l have your knife, Mr. Roat.<br> And l've got the matches, Mrs. Hendrix.<br> No, no.<br> No, no, no! No more! No, no, no!<br> No! lt's out! lt's out. lt's out, l said!<br> Cut it out!<br> Stop!<br> Try lighting your match now, Mr. Roat.<br> Throw your matches over to me. Go on.<br> Don't move. l still have your knife.<br> Pick up the cane.<br> Tap on the floor right where you are<br> so l know where you are. Go on. Tap.<br> Tap.<br> Keep tapping.<br> Keep tapping.<br> Keep tapping.<br> Tap.<br> Keep tapping.<br> Tap. Tap.<br> Tap.<br> Louder.<br> Louder!<br> Tap.<br> Well, Susy.<br> lt's all over.<br> Drop the knife.<br> And the matches.<br> Down we go.<br> All right.<br> All right, you can have it.<br> You can have the doll.<br> l'll give it to you<br> if you'll just go and--<br> -Yes, Susy?<br> -Not hurt me.<br> Say, "please."<br> -Please.<br> -No, that's not quite it.<br> "Please may l give you the doll?"<br> Please may l give you the doll?<br> You may.<br> The doll.<br> Catchy tune.<br> Well, Susy, now l want you in the bedroom.<br> -You said you wouldn't hurt me.<br> -Did l?<br> l must've had my fingers crossed.<br> Good girl.<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> Window.<br> Where is it?<br> Where is it?! Oh, God!<br> Wait! Wait!<br> You stay here. Do you understand?<br> All right, come on. Look out.<br> Hurry!<br> Here! Let me try.<br> Take it easy.<br> Don't waste your time.<br> Susy!<br> Susy, where are you?<br> -Susy!<br> -You know this man?<br> No. Susy, for God's sake, where--?<br> Must be in the bedroom.<br> l tried. lt won't work.<br> All right, bring your flashlight.<br> l got some bulbs in here.<br> My God, where is she?<br> l'm gonna have another look in the--<br> God in heaven.<br> -Susy!
