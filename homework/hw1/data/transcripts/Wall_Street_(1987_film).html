are you<br> offering me?<br> at a half.<br> Put it on the tape,<br> a few thousand up.<br> Your company,<br> ladies and gentlemen,<br> Your company,<br> ladies and gentlemen,<br> is under siege<br> from Gordon Gekko!<br> Teldar Paper is now<br> leveraged to the hilt<br> like some piss-poor<br> South American country.<br> I strongly recommend you<br> to see through Mr. Gekko's<br> shameless intention here<br> to strip this company<br> and severely penalize<br> the stockholders!<br> I strongly recommend you<br> to reject his tender<br> by voting for management's<br> restructuring of the stock.<br> My thanks.<br> Well, I appreciate<br> the opportunity<br> you're giving me,<br> Mr. Cromwell,<br> as the single<br> largest shareholder<br> in Teldar Paper, to speak.<br> Well, ladies and gentlemen,<br> we're not here<br> to indulge in fantasy,<br> but in political<br> and economic reality.<br> America... America has become<br> a second-rate power.<br> Its trade deficit<br> and its fiscal deficit<br> are at nightmare<br> proportions.<br> Now, in the days<br> of the free market,<br> when we were<br> a top industrial power,<br> there was accountability<br> to the stockholder.<br> The Carnegies, the Mellons,<br> the men<br> that built this empire,<br> did it because it was<br> their money at stake.<br> Today, management has<br> no stake in the company!<br> Altogether,<br> these men sitting up here<br> own less than 3%<br> of the company.<br> Where does Mr. Cromwell put<br> his million-dollar salary?<br> Not in Teldar Stock.<br> He owns less than 1%.<br> You own the company.<br> That's right.<br> You, the stockholder.<br> You are all being<br> royally screwed over<br> by these...<br> these bureaucrats<br> with their steak luncheons,<br> hunting and fishing trips,<br> their corporate jets,<br> and golden parachutes.<br> This is an outrage!<br> You're out of line, Gekko!<br> Teldar Paper, Mr. Cromwell,<br> Teldar Paper has 33<br> different vice presidents,<br> each earning<br> over $200,000 a year.<br> Now I've spent<br> the last two months<br> analyzing what<br> these guys do.<br> I still can't figure it out.<br> One thing I do know<br> is that our paper company<br> lost $110 million last year.<br> I'll bet half of that<br> was spent in the paperwork<br> going back and forth between these<br> vice presidents.<br> The new law of evolution<br> in corporate America<br> seems to be<br> survival of the unfittest.<br> Well, in my book,<br> you either do it right<br> or you get eliminated.<br> In the last seven deals<br> that I've been<br> involved with,<br> there were<br> who have made a pretax<br> profit of $12 billion.<br> Thank you.<br> I am not a destroyer<br> of companies.<br> I am a liberator<br> of them!<br> The point is,<br> ladies and gentlemen,<br> that greed,<br> for lack of a better word,<br> is good.<br> Greed is right.<br> Greed works.<br> Greed clarifies,<br> cuts through,<br> and captures the essence<br> of the evolutionary spirit.<br> Greed, in all of its forms...<br> greed for life, for money,<br> for love, knowledge...<br> has marked the upward surge<br> of mankind,<br> and greed...<br> you mark my words...<br> will not only save<br> Teldar Paper,<br> but that other<br> malfunctioning corporation<br> called the U.S.A.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Great!<br> Thank you.<br> Buy me 20 June<br> eurodollar CDs,<br> and sell 10 September deutschmarks.<br> Right.<br> Talk at you, babe.<br> Aww!

offshore account.<br> Come on in.<br> So... what's the problema?<br> Do you know what the fuck<br> the problem is?<br> What?<br> You don't know?<br> No.<br> I get a strange call<br> from the SEC.<br> They asked to see<br> my records.<br> This is heavy,<br> Bud...<br> Relax, Roget.<br> You're 82M<br> in the account numbers,<br> and I'm the invisible man.<br> That's good<br> for you, Bud.<br> They're always looking<br> for red flags.<br> Gekko's always<br> getting checked by them.<br> They never come up<br> with anything, Rog.<br> Hey...<br> we're invulnerable<br> on this one.<br> I just want to<br> slow down, Bud,<br> all right?<br> No more lunches,<br> no calls, all right?<br> We suspend our business,<br> all right?<br> Whatever you want, Rog.<br> It's cool.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hey, Rog.<br> Come back in.<br> Bring the cost report.<br> They're starting again.<br> Gekko's asked us<br> into the Bluestar deal.<br> We're reviewing<br> timetables.<br> You want to come?<br> He didn't tell me<br> about that.<br> You're only the president<br> of the company.<br> What the hell<br> do you know, anyway?<br> Guys, new chief of Bluestar,<br> Bud Fox.<br> Yeah, hi.<br> Look, guys, what's the problem?<br> It's time to kill.<br> Gekko's got 12%<br> of the stock and climbing.<br> He's got the unions<br> in his back pocket.<br> Everybody knows<br> the stock's in play.<br> By next week,<br> the street's going to own Bluestar.<br> Is the bank financing<br> in place,<br> or will we have<br> more ridiculous meetings?<br> Our firm committed weeks ago<br> long-term debt structure,<br> and unless you guys<br> sign this paper now,<br> I'm going to pull<br> and go to another bank<br> for the 75.<br> And go to another bank<br> for the 75.<br> We've got 30 banks<br> ready to participate<br> in a four-year<br> revolving credit line,<br> but we must have your assurance<br> you will pay back<br> most of the loan<br> in 12 months.<br> The only way we can<br> see this happening<br> is liquidating the hangars<br> and the planes.<br> Can you people guarantee<br> the liquidation of Bluestar?<br> No sweat!<br> We got the Bleezburg brothers<br> ready to build condos<br> where the hangars are.<br> The Mexicans are dumb enough<br> to buy the airplanes.<br> I got Texas boys<br> drooling at my kneecaps<br> for the routes and slots.<br> What's your problem?<br> It's done.<br> These are the price tags<br> on the 737 s, gates,<br> hangars, routes.<br> We got it nailed right down<br> to the typewriters.<br> The beauty of this deal<br> is the overfunded pension.<br> Gekko makes<br> $75 million there.<br> annuities for 6,000 employees,<br> and he walks away<br> with the rest.<br> I figure he'll make<br> $60, $70 million...<br> not bad for a month's work.<br> Your boy really did his homework,<br> Fox.<br> You'll have the shortest<br> executive career<br> since that pope<br> that got poisoned.<br> Now he'll really<br> start believing<br> he's Gekko the great.<br> Can you change<br> that appointment?<br> Hold this.<br> He's in a meeting!<br> A really ingenious way<br> for us to...<br> Didn't know<br> we had a meeting<br> scheduled today, sport.<br> I didn't, either.<br> I think we should talk.<br> Would you gentlemen<br> excuse us for a second, please?<br> Come this way, gentlemen.<br> Thank you, Alex.<br> What the hell<br> do you want?<br> I found out about the garage sale<br> at Bluestar.<br> Why?<br> Last night<br> I was reading Rudy<br> the story of Winnie the Pooh<br> and the honey pot.<br> He stuck his nose<br> in the pot once too often,<br> and he got stuck.<br> Maybe you should<br> read him Pinocchio.<br> You were turning Bluestar around,<br> not upside-down.<br> You fuckin' used me!<br> You're walking around blind<br> without a cane.<br> A fool and his money<br> are lucky to get together.<br> Why do you need<br> to wreck this company?<br> Because it's wreckable!<br> I changed my mind.<br> If these people<br> lose their jobs,<br> they got nowhere to go.<br> My father has worked there<br> for 24 years.<br> I gave him my word!<br> It's all about bucks, kid.<br> The rest is conversation.<br> Buddy, you'll still<br> be president.<br> When the time comes,<br> you'll parachute out<br> a rich man.<br> With the money you'll make,<br> your dad won't<br> have to work anymore.<br> When does it all end?<br> How much is enough?<br> It's not a question<br> of enough, pal.<br> It's a zero sum game.<br> Somebody wins,<br> somebody loses.<br> Money itself<br> isn't lost or made,<br> it's simply transferred<br> from one perception<br> to another,<br> like magic.<br> This painting here,<br> I bought it 10 years ago<br> for $60,000.<br> I could sell it today for 600.<br> The illusion<br> has become real.<br> The more real it becomes,<br> the more desperate<br> they want it.<br> Capitalism at its finest.<br> How much is enough, Gordon?<br> The richest 1%<br> of this country<br> owns 1/2<br> our country's wealth,<br> $5 trillion.<br> comes from hard work.<br> from inheritance,<br> interest<br> on interest accumulating<br> to widows and idiot sons,<br> and what I do...<br> stock and real estate<br> speculation.<br> It's bullshit.<br> You got 90%<br> of the American public<br> out there<br> with little or no net worth.<br> I create nothing.<br> I own.<br> We make the rules, pal.<br> The news, war,<br> peace, famine, upheaval,<br> The price of a paper clip.<br> We pick that rabbit<br> out of that hat<br> while everybody wonders<br> how the hell we did it.<br> You're not naive<br> enough to think<br> we're living in a democracy,<br> are you, Buddy?<br> It's the free market.<br> You're part of it.<br> Yeah, you got<br> that killer instinct.<br> Stick around, pal.<br> I still got a lot<br> to teach you.<br> Obviously.<br> I was going to tell you about it,<br> all right?<br> We'll have dinner tonight.<br> You bring Darien.<br> I can't make it tonight.<br> Hey, Buddy...<br> are you with me?<br> I need to know<br> if you're with me.<br> I'm with you, Gordon.<br> Natalie, I'll be right there.<br> Yeah.<br> Ollie, tell them<br> I want zip-locked mouths<br> on the Bluestar deal,<br> or I'll personally rip out<br> their fuckin' throats.<br> Bud.<br> What's going on?<br> I've been played<br> like a grand piano<br> by the master,<br> Gekko the great.<br> Today was the big crash.<br> Liquidation sale.<br> He's going to carve Bluestar<br> into little pieces<br> and sell it all off.<br> Bastard.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I was afraid something like this<br> could happen.<br> I handed it to him<br> on a silver platter.<br> I told my father,<br> those people...<br> Bud, it's not your fault,<br> and it's not your decision.<br> I won't let it happen.<br> Don't cross Gordon.<br> He'll crush you.<br> If Gordon doesn't<br> buy Bluestar,<br> someone else will,<br> and who's to say they won't<br> do the same thing?<br> At least I won't be<br> pulling the trigger.<br> Why are you doing this?<br> You've worked hard<br> to get where you are.<br> We're so close.<br> You don't want to<br> throw it all away.<br> Look, I can stay with the firm,<br> and you're doing fine.<br> We can survive<br> without Gordon Gekko.<br> I'm not looking<br> to just survive.<br> I've been doing that<br> all my life.<br> Cut this self-pity crap, Bud.<br> What the hell's<br> that supposed to mean?<br> It means if you make an enemy<br> of Gordon Gekko,<br> I can't be there<br> to stand by you.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Do you really mean that?<br> What did he promise you?<br> Take you public?<br> I guess without Gordon's money<br> and seal of approval<br> I'm not such<br> a hot investment anymore.<br> You're just the best<br> money can buy, Darien.<br> You're not exactly pure, Bud.<br> You went after Gekko<br> like you went after me.<br> Look in the mirror...<br> I'm looking,<br> and I sure don't like what I see.<br> Fair enough,<br> but it's not that simple, Bud.<br> When I was down<br> and had nothing,<br> it was Gordon<br> who helped me.<br> He got me all my clients,<br> you among them.<br> He can take them away from me<br> like that.<br> You may find out<br> one day<br> that when you've had<br> money and lost it,<br> it's worse than never having<br> it at all.<br> That is bullshit!<br> Hey! Hey!<br> You step out that door,<br> and I am changing the locks!<br> You may not<br> believe this, Bud,<br> but I really do<br> care for you.<br> We would have made<br> a good team.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Get the fuck<br> out of here.<br> The market<br> is dead right now.<br> Even the rich<br> are bitchin'.<br> Only thing moving is the termites<br> and cockroaches.<br> With my commission...<br> Save the rap.<br> Just sell the fucker fast.<br> There he is.<br> Where you been<br> the last two days?<br> Call my father.<br> Your father, he's, um...<br> He had a heart attack.<br> He's all right.<br> He's at St. John's.<br> Mom, how is he?<br> He was complaining<br> about chest pains at work.<br> Next thing they know,<br> he's collapsed.<br> You got to talk to him.<br> He's a tough old nut,<br> your dad.<br> He's got<br> another 20 years.<br> Is he conscious?<br> Hiya, dad.<br> You're looking<br> younger every day.<br> Didn't I tell you never to lift a 747<br> by yourself?<br> You even got me<br> smoking now.<br> It's your second<br> heart attack, Dad.<br> You're pushing your luck.<br> I hope you know that.<br> I guess I never told you...<br> but I love you, dad.<br> I love you so much.<br> I'm sorry<br> about the things I said.<br> You're the only<br> honest man I know...<br> the best.<br> I got a plan, dad.<br> I can save the airline.<br> You got no reason<br> to believe me,<br> but you have to<br> trust me.<br> I need to speak<br> to the union members.<br> Can I speak for you?<br> Your words, not mine.<br> O.K.<br> Thank you.<br> I got to go.<br> I'm proud of you.<br> Thanks.<br> The stock's at 191/4,<br> and it's going up.<br> Gekko figures<br> by breaking up Bluestar,<br> it's worth at least<br> $30 a share.<br> He'll buy up to 24<br> and think he's profiting.<br> How do you know it'll go up?<br> I have some friends.<br> O.K. What happens now?<br> When it hits 23,<br> go to Gekko, lower the boom.<br> When he learns he has no union<br> concessions, he'll sell everything.<br> What's to prevent<br> some other shark<br> from devouring us?<br> We have an appointment<br> to see Mr. Wildman.<br> Sir Lawrence...<br> can I call you Larry?<br> What about<br> owning Bluestar Airlines<br> with union concessions<br> at $18 a share,<br> and in the process<br> hanging Gordon Gekko<br> out in the wind to twist?<br> I might be<br> very interested.<br> Why you, mate?<br> What are you doing<br> mixed up with Gekko?<br> Let's just say<br> me and Mr. Gekko<br> have a serious<br> conflict of interest.<br> We all want to see<br> this airline work.<br> These figures show<br> that it can.<br> You're prepared to take<br> these large salary cuts?<br> We are,<br> but we want a contract agreement<br> that's ironclad.<br> If you buy it,<br> you can't break it up.<br> I'm still listening.<br> Hi.<br> Oh, hi.<br> You get the hell<br> out of my office.<br> I've been a schmuck.<br> I want to apologize.<br> You've been<br> a real schmuck lately.<br> Go thou<br> and sin no more.<br> I want to<br> make it up to you.<br> Bluestar.<br> Put all your clients<br> in it.<br> O.K., Buddy, Buddy.<br> We are back in business<br> on Bluestar.<br> Bluestar, Mr. Mannheim.<br> Put all your clients<br> in it.<br> It's going to move.<br> I don't know where you get<br> your information,<br> but I don't like it.<br> Money makes you do things<br> you don't want to do.<br> It's a quick scalp<br> for you.<br> at 191/2.<br> The Chronicle's on 7.<br> Hold, Marty.<br> Listen, Blue Horseshoe<br> loves Bluestar Airlines,<br> Got it?<br> Got it.<br> Right.<br> Marty, you still there?<br> Bluestar's in play.<br> Let's check it out.<br> I do love it so.<br> It's 215/8.<br> I don't know<br> what to make of it.<br> The word is out, pal.<br> Your union buddies<br> are talking.<br> You get me in<br> at a 45-degree angle,<br> all the way in.<br> Buy everything in sight<br> up to 22,<br> then call me.<br> When I get the son of a bitch<br> who leaked this,<br> I'll suck<br> his fuckin' skull.<br> Stock's going to Pluto, man.<br> Start unloading.<br> Sell?<br> Dump it all.<br> Where's Lou?<br> Right over there.<br> Ken, Marv<br> at Jackson-Steinem.<br> We gotta dump this baby.<br> Take the money and run<br> on BST.<br> It's gotta be<br> a big hitter.<br> There's a batch of people<br> from Bluestar Airlines here.<br> What the hell<br> do they want?<br> We know what you're<br> up to, Gekko.<br> You can go<br> straight to hell.<br> No way you're going to<br> break up our airline.<br> That's the first<br> I've heard of it.<br> We have an agreement<br> which I expect you<br> to honor.<br> You better hope to have<br> your pilot's license.<br> We won't let the engines<br> fall out of the planes.<br> A lot of the baggage<br> headed for St. Petersburg<br> could easily<br> wind up in Pittsburgh.<br> Somebody else wants<br> to buy your airline.<br> You want to be gobbled<br> by Attila the Hun,<br> be my guest!<br> We'll take<br> our chances.<br> Nice to see you,<br> Gekko.<br> Fox says Bluestar<br> just hit 23.<br> What do you<br> want him to do?<br> Sell it all.<br> What the hell?<br> So we only<br> make 10 million.<br> Sell it.<br> Sold!
