A murderer!<br> A deposer of kings!<br> A colossus!<br> A fresh wind! A cleansing force!<br> What does your father say<br> when he hears you?<br> We don't talk about things like that,<br> my father and I.<br> - How is he?<br> - The doctors say he'll die any moment.<br> - Have you been to see him?<br> - I'm waiting to be asked.<br> In heaven, all things will be arranged.<br> I believe that's the rumour.<br> This is your home<br> when you want it to be,<br> and the Rostovs are your family<br> when you want them to be.<br> I smoke too much.<br> Isn't it lovely? How can you bear<br> not to go with them?<br> I can bear it.<br> If I were a man, I'd be down there,<br> riding a terrible black horse,<br> waving a sword.<br> It's so unfair.<br> Men are the only people<br> permitted to have any fun.<br> What is it, Natasha?<br> Those handsome young men<br> marching away to fight.<br> They could be killed.<br> Don't be frightened. Come on.<br> Nicholas!<br> Now, what's this?<br> You look so dazzling in your uniform.<br> And you're going so far away.<br> Austria's miles,<br> I looked it up on the map.<br> That brute, Napoleon.<br> The Austrians make beautiful<br> bracelets. I'll bring you one.<br> - Two! They're wearing them in pairs!<br> - Two.<br> Pierre, you remember our cousin,<br> Sonya. She's come to stay.<br> Yes, though she was considerably<br> younger the last time I saw her.<br> Girls grow up, Pierre. Very fast.<br> Doesn't he look glorious?<br> Mama and Papa have<br> such handsome children!<br> Did you hear that?<br> Now, attention!<br> Ensign Count Nicholas Rostov,<br> I decorate you with the Order of...<br> ...Absolutely Everything!<br> Don't laugh when she jokes<br> about the army.<br> Well, Petya,<br> you have to humour women a little!<br> You do look shiny, Nicholas.<br> If only I was old enough.<br> That'll come.<br> By that time, there won't be<br> a Frenchman left to be killed!<br> Don't worry, there'll always be<br> plenty of Frenchmen.<br> - Good luck.<br> - That's very civil of you.<br> - But why not take a commission?<br> - It's so easy for you men.<br> You decide to do something, then do it.<br> If you were a man, what would you do?<br> I'd become enormously powerful.<br> I'd become the Czar's most trusted<br> minister, and he'd consult me.<br> And you would sit at my right hand.<br> Whenever anything was complicated,<br> the case would be laid before you<br> as judge.<br> Why me?<br> Because your heart is pure<br> and you're good.<br> Well done, my dear.<br> On that note, I think I should leave.<br> If you had that power,<br> what would you do?<br> I?<br> I would hesitate. Now I must go.<br> - Pierre, come again soon.<br> - I'll walk you to the door.<br> - "Au revoir."<br> - Come soon again.<br> Come again soon.<br> Mama and Papa will be awfully<br> lonely with Nicholas gone.<br> - They do love seeing you.<br> - Of course. I love the whole family.<br> The whole family?<br> That's not as simple as you think.<br> What do you mean?<br> There are currents and counter-currents.<br> Au revoir.<br> Now, where are you going?<br> Dolokhov's rooms?<br> I am. How did you know?<br> I hear things, I hear things.<br> Go. Go to your night of disgusting,<br> fascinating debauchery.<br> Au revoir.<br> Bravo! Bravo!<br> - Careful, there's a bet on here.<br> - Fetch me a bottle of rum!<br> You two, break this out.<br> Now, let's get this straight.<br> Fifty imperials against Prince Anatole<br> that I drink a bottle of rum<br> without taking it from my mouth,<br> balancing on the outside ledge<br> without touching the sides of the window.<br> - Want to make it a hundred?<br> - Fifty is enough for you to lose.<br> Get down from there, you weaklings.<br> - Hercules, come on!<br> - Come on!<br> You do it!<br> Hail Moscow!<br> Give me that!<br> Don't be crazy, you'll be killed.<br> Touch me again,<br> I'll throw you down there.<br> That goes for every one of you.<br> Play! Play!<br> What are we paying you for?<br> Now then, my friends.<br> Remember, without taking the bottle<br> from your lips.<br> Bravo!<br> Fifty imperials, Anatole!<br> And double for anyone else<br> who will do it.<br> I'll do it for nothing, without a bet!<br> - You get dizzy walking up steps!<br> - Out of my way!<br> Give me a bottle!<br> Get down from there.<br> - Get down from there, Pierre.<br> - Let him do it.<br> Your father is calling for you.<br> Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> I suggest a little cold water first.<br> I'll wait for you.<br> Prince Andrei,<br> is the old boy really dying?<br> The doctors are certain<br> Count Bezukhov won't last the night.<br> - Are my father and sister there?<br> - He was there. She was expected.<br> That's good. I don't have to go.<br> The family's well represented.<br> Careful, careful.<br> You disapprove of me? Of course.<br> You'd be wrong if you didn't.<br> Arriving at the deathbed of my father<br> bleary-eyed, stinking of alcohol.<br> He disapproves, too, my father.<br> That's fair enough. I disapprove<br> of many things about him.<br> Chiefly, I disapprove of the fact<br> that he didn't marry my mother.<br> Perhaps, if I was legitimate...<br> I have sinned, Lord,<br> but I have several excellent excuses.<br> With all that, Andrei,<br> you still disapprove?<br> You're not being worthy of yourself.<br> You're not living up to the best things<br> in yourself. Be somebody!<br> That's where the puzzle begins,<br> be somebody. Be what? Who am I?<br> Am I the next Count Bezukhov,<br> lord of vast estates,<br> with a fixed position,<br> fixed responsibilities?<br> Not quite!<br> My father cannot quite acknowledge<br> that I am his son.<br> But he cannot quite acknowledge<br> that I am not his son.<br> That makes everybody uncomfortable,<br> including myself.<br> - You must aim at something.<br> - You're right, I agree with you.<br> Each morning I wake up,<br> I'm disgusted with myself<br> with what I did the night before.<br> I tell myself, "Today, a change."<br> If my headache is bad enough,<br> I say, "Pierre...<br> "...today you must take steps<br> to become a saint."<br> I drop into the club<br> and watch the card-playing,<br> just order a glass of water to prove<br> how marvellously I resist temptation.<br> Then someone comes along<br> and says, "Just one vodka, Pierre."<br> Next morning, my headache is worse,<br> my pockets are emptier.<br> There must be<br> something you want to do.<br> I want to discover... everything!<br> I want to discover why I know<br> what's right and still do what's wrong.<br> I want to discover what happiness is,<br> and what value there is in suffering.<br> I want to discover why men go to war,<br> and what they really say<br> deep in their hearts when they pray.<br> I want to discover what men and<br> women feel when they say they love.<br> There's enough to keep me busy.<br> It's hard to understand someone like me.<br> Everything is so clear for you.<br> - You know exactly what you must do.<br> - Oh, exactly!<br> You're different from me.<br> You study, you become enlightened.<br> I study, I become confused.<br> You love, you marry. You believe,<br> you act. There's a war, you serve.<br> If only I really answered<br> to your description.<br> - You do.<br> - Shall I show you how wrong you are?<br> - I know you. I'm not wrong.<br> - Know why I'm going to the war?<br> Because I regard Napoleon<br> as a monster?<br> Because I believe we should fight<br> Austria's battles 2,000 miles away?<br> Because Russia will be<br> a greater nation after the war?<br> Then, why?<br> Because I married the most loving<br> and attractive woman in Moscow,<br> and I can't stand it.<br> Never marry, Pierre.<br> Or only when you're old<br> and good for nothing,<br> or else everything noble in you<br> will be lost.<br> You'll waste yourself on trifles.<br> Yes. Don't look at me like that.<br> You talk of Bonaparte's career.<br> If Bonaparte had married young,<br> he'd still be on half-pay,<br> carrying his wife's handbag,<br> inviting idiots to his house because<br> his wife wanted invitations to theirs!<br> - Prince Andrei.<br> - Princess Hlene.<br> You told my brother he was expected?<br> - I did.<br> - Isn't he coming?<br> I believe not.<br> Thank you.<br> How is he, Prince Vasili?<br> His confessor is with him.<br> They are giving him extreme unction.<br> He was asking for you.<br> I hope you are in a proper condition<br> to see him this time.<br> Follow me.<br> Go ahead. I'll wait for you here.<br> If you please, Monsieur Pierre.<br> He wishes you to kiss him goodbye.<br> This is for you.<br> Now he would like to sleep.<br> Pierre...<br> So late.<br> Finally, at the end, he loved me.<br> So late.<br> He gave me this.<br> This letter is for the Czar.<br> - And this one for you, Pierre.<br> - Open it.<br> "Your father, in his letter to the Czar,<br> "he begs that you be legitimately<br> acknowledged as his son<br> "and the next Count Bezukhov,<br> the sole heir to all his estates."<br> Be worthy, my boy.<br> Be worthy of your great father.<br> How often we sin.<br> How much we deceive, and for what?<br> It all ends in death.<br> Kiss your cousin, Hlene,<br> he has been reborn.<br> Embrace him. Wish him well.<br> It's a good thing<br> we're going back to Moscow.<br> After three weeks in the country,<br> I can hardly keep my eyes open.<br> Still, it was a profitable trip,<br> wasn't it, Pierre?<br> Very profitable.<br> I'll see how long we have to wait.<br> There's no hurry. It'll give Papa<br> a few extra winks of sleep.<br> Andrei!<br> Pierre!<br> - Where are you going? Your father's?<br> - Yes. Tell me your news.<br> - Are you alone?<br> - No. Prince Vasili is with me.<br> And his daughter, too.<br> We made a tour of inspection of<br> my estates. It's huge and backward.<br> Now I'm Count Bezukhov,<br> I must do something about it.<br> That's why you went<br> with Prince Vasili and Hlene.<br> Prince Vasili helps me<br> with the administration.<br> Of course.<br> Say hello to Lise.<br> She's miserable at being<br> stuck in the country.<br> Hlene loves the country.<br> It was her idea to come.<br> I'm sure.<br> - Children, go away!<br> - How long are you here?<br> For ever.<br> Months and months and months!<br> Until after the baby is born.<br> No, thank you.<br> Andrei's leaving tomorrow.<br> He thought it'd be better for me here<br> than alone in Moscow.<br> How do you feel about it?<br> I dread it.<br> Even so, you consented<br> to bury yourself down here?<br> Andrei wants me to.<br> If it were I,<br> I'd find something else to do.<br> I suppose so.<br> But we're very different.<br> Indeed we are.<br> - Have you asked her to marry you?<br> - No.<br> Are you going to?<br> I don't know yet.<br> - Do you want some advice?<br> - On any subject. Not on this.<br> All right.<br> Andrei! Lise!<br> We thought you'd never come.<br> Lise, you look so beautiful.<br> - You, too, Mary.<br> - No, I'm just a country mouse.<br> It isn't true what you wrote,<br> that you're only staying overnight?<br> - I'm afraid it is.<br> - Lise, talk to him. Make him stay.<br> - I've tried.<br> - Lise's very tired. She'd better rest.<br> - Yes?<br> - Your father would like to see you.<br> Thank you.<br> You'd better go upstairs, Lise.<br> You'll see him at dinner.<br> Come!<br> Here's the warrior!<br> Here's the Bolkonsky<br> that's going to beat Napoleon.<br> How are you, my boy?<br> I'm well, Father. How is your health?<br> The same, boy, the same.<br> Only fools fall ill.<br> You know me,<br> busy from morning till night.<br> Little to eat, less to drink,<br> of course I'm well.<br> - Thank God.<br> - God has nothing to do with it.<br> Just a moment, please.<br> - Don't refuse.<br> - What is it?<br> Father's father used to take it<br> along with him... in all his wars.<br> If it's not too heavy<br> and won't break my neck.<br> Promise that you'll never take it off.<br> - Promise?<br> - Yes.<br> Kiss me here.<br> Thank you, my boy.<br> - Why do you thank me, Father?<br> - For doing your duty.<br> For not allowing yourself<br> to be tied to a woman's apron strings.<br> The army before everything.<br> Thank you, thank you.<br> About my wife, Father...<br> Your wife? Go on, speak.<br> When her confinement is due,<br> send to Moscow for a doctor.<br> - A doctor?<br> - No one can do nature's work.<br> But they've been telling her things<br> and she's had a dream.<br> She's frightened.<br> All right, all right.<br> Give this to Michael Kutuzov.<br> We were at school together.<br> He wasn't exactly a bright lad,<br> but never mind.<br> I've written to tell him<br> to keep you away from headquarters.<br> They're bad places.<br> Tell him I remember him<br> and admire him.<br> Now, goodbye.<br> Remember this, Prince Andrei.<br> If they kill you,<br> it will hurt me, your old father.<br> But, if you don't behave like the son<br> of Nicholas Bolkonsky, it will be worse.<br> I shall be shamed.<br> You needn't have said that to me, Father.<br> I... also wanted to ask you,<br> if I am killed and I have a son,<br> don't let him be taken away from you.<br> Let him grow up here.<br> With you. Please.<br> What are you waiting for?<br> We've said goodbye. Go! Go!<br> Andrei, you're leaving already?<br> Don't go, don't leave me here.<br> I'll be so lonely.<br> I'll leave you here<br> with my father and Mary.<br> Stay until tomorrow.<br> Stay another day.<br> I can't, Lise, you know that!<br> You're delighted to go.<br> You're delighted to get rid of me!<br> Andrei, Andrei...<br> Bye, Mary.<br> Katya, get some smelling salts.<br> Tell the silly horse to stop shaking<br> its head. I'll never get it.<br> You heard the lady,<br> stop shaking your head.<br> You see? Animals are much<br> more reasonable than people.<br> Might I offer you a million roubles<br> to paint my portrait?<br> But you must make me<br> look at least as good as the horse!<br> It's not fair to look at it<br> before it's finished.<br> - Very unpromising, isn't it?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> You needn't be<br> in such a hurry to agree.<br> It's not meant to be a work of art.<br> Papa bought the colt for Nicholas.<br> I'll send him the picture<br> to show him what it's like.<br> - Have you finished?<br> - For the moment.<br> Charge! Come on! Hurry!<br> Come on! Come on!<br> - Have you heard from Nicholas?<br> - Papa received a letter. Not me.<br> Men forget about women when at war.<br> - Men don't, boys do.<br> - Nicholas would be furious at that!<br> - He'd challenge you to a duel.<br> - It's a better reason than most.<br> The reason he wrote<br> was for more money.<br> He lends money to his captain<br> who loses it at cards.<br> The captain sounds a lot like Papa.<br> His name's Denisov.<br> He's got moustaches out to here.<br> He lisps and he's the bravest man<br> in the world.<br> Nicholas says<br> he's having a glorious time,<br> and we'll win the war soon.<br> He's beginning to feel quite sorry<br> for Napoleon.<br> Kill them! Come on, men!<br> Take that! Come on, charge!<br> There's no doubt,<br> wars must be very amusing.<br> - I must put it on my list.<br> - What list?<br> My list of the greatest human<br> pleasures in order of importance.<br> - I'd neglected war.<br> - What are the other pleasures?<br> The opera, eternal friendship,<br> summertime, dancing the mazurka,<br> the country in spring<br> and welcoming soldiers home.<br> - Have you any suggestions?<br> - Let me think.<br> To be able to believe in God,<br> to cause happiness, to love.<br> Love! Sonya's in love with Nicholas.<br> She cries every day in the morning<br> for a full hour.<br> - Don't you intend to fall in love?<br> - Many times but only for recreation.<br> And I'll keep changing partners<br> like a dance.<br> When I finally say,<br> "I love you," and mean it,<br> it'll be like a defeated general,<br> surrendering and handing his sword<br> to his enemy.<br> You'll change.<br> When you're young, everybody's<br> always telling you you'll change.<br> - Are you dining with us tonight?<br> - I have a previous engagement.<br> Oh? With whom?<br> My cousin, Princess Hlene.<br> Oh. I'd like to be like her<br> when I grow up.<br> I'd have to fill out around here, though.<br> Tall, proud, beautiful, cold<br> and untouchable.<br> With regiments of men<br> dropping at my feet.<br> I'm going to marry her, Natasha.<br> Gently, gently.<br> Who's surrendering his sword,<br> you or she?<br> Be happy, dearest Pierre.<br> I order you to be supremely happy.<br> I'll be leaving again directly. Wait.<br> I must deliver a message<br> to General Kutuzov immediately.<br> Well, I...<br> There's the General's aide.<br> Talk to him, Ensign.<br> I've just come from the picket lines.<br> I've a message<br> for the Commander-in-Chief.<br> His Excellency is in a council of war.<br> Give me the message.<br> A verbal message.<br> Deliver it to me now.<br> My squadron is on picket duty.<br> We saw the French put out their fires.<br> - The enemy's on the move, sir.<br> - Is that all?<br> Is that all?<br> I'd say you've seen no action yet,<br> am I right?<br> Good luck, my friend.<br> ...it's apparent the enemy<br> has regrouped his position.<br> Surely now, you should consider<br> changing the orders for tomorrow.<br> Or rather for today,<br> for it is past midnight.<br> Gentlemen...<br> Gentlemen, the orders for tomorrow<br> cannot now be altered.<br> You've heard them,<br> and we shall all do our duty.<br> But, before a battle,<br> there is nothing more important...<br> ...than to have a good sleep.<br> Goodnight.<br> - Goodnight, sir.<br> - Goodnight, sir.<br> - Goodnight, sir.<br> - Goodnight, sir.<br> But, sir, if the French are<br> that far south of Austerlitz...<br> Plans!<br> After the battle, they'll have a hundred<br> reasons why the plans didn't work.<br> They'll blame everything<br> but themselves.<br> How do you think it will go tomorrow?<br> I think the battle will be lost.<br> We shall not have lost the war,<br> Andrei, because of this one battle.<br> There will be a peace...<br> ...and then a new war.<br> Men like Napoleon can never stop<br> till their own ambition destroys them.<br> The only important battle is the last.<br> Goodnight.<br> Fire!<br> Sir, it looks as if the French<br> have broken our flank.<br> Captain, the Hussars must charge.<br> - You're wounded.<br> - The wound's not here, it's there!<br> Stop them!<br> Stop those cowards, Bolkonsky!<br> Forward, lads! Forward!<br> Forward!<br> Forward, lads! Forward!<br> That is a fine death.<br> Oh, he is alive!<br> Have him attended to<br> and take him to my bivouac.<br> Let my doctor examine his wounds.<br> - So early in the morning, Pierre.<br> - It's 11 o'clock.<br> - So early!<br> - We have a lot of shopping to do.<br> Oh, Pierre, I'm so tired.<br> All right, I'll go myself<br> and come back early.<br> - The morning papers, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Anything amusing in "The Gazette?"<br> - No, we've lost again.<br> An armistice is going to be discussed.<br> Prisoners and wounded on both sides<br> will be immediately returned.<br> In a word, we're suing for peace.<br> - You sound bitter.<br> - Maybe I am.<br> What difference does it make,<br> a piece of Poland changes hands?<br> It's so boring<br> to worry about things like that!<br> - So, no more war.<br> - For the time being.<br> For the time being.<br> - Then the armies will be coming back.<br> - I suppose so.<br> Moscow will be very gay and exciting.<br> Pierre, why don't we stay here<br> and not go to the country?<br> Not this year.<br> It'll be such a gay season.<br> I'm not interested. Besides, I have<br> work at the hospital, the school.<br> They'll do just as well without you<br> in the hospital and the schools.<br> I promised those people.<br> Well, I never liked the idea!<br> Pierre, come here.<br> Listen, you know what we can do?<br> You go to the country all by yourself.<br> Do what you have to do.<br> Get the house ready,<br> then I'll join you in the spring.<br> The country's so dreary in the winter.<br> Please don't force it on me, Pierre.<br> If you must stay, stay,<br> but I'll be lost without you there.<br> Nonsense.<br> It will be good for the both of us.<br> And you'll appreciate me more when<br> you haven't seen me for some time.<br> I couldn't appreciate you more, Hlene.<br> If you only knew how many things<br> I have to do, dresses to have made,<br> lots of shoes and...<br> Why are you looking at me<br> like that? Why?<br> What does it mean?<br> Nothing, my dear.<br> They were defeated.<br> What are they cheering about?<br> Because they fought, because they're<br> alive, because they've come home.<br> I hope nothing's happened.<br> - Gracious! The young Captain!<br> - Prokofy!<br> Prokofy, is everything all right?<br> - The Lord be thanked. Yes.<br> - Good!<br> Nicholas!<br> Natasha!<br> You're back!<br> It's you, my dearest Nicholas!<br> Sonya!<br> - Look, it's him!<br> - Nicholas! Hurray!<br> - Papa!<br> - Nicholas!<br> Nicholas!<br> Nicholas...<br> Mama.<br> - You must be...?<br> - Your son's friend.<br> I know, Nicholas wrote to us.<br> Natasha, Sonya!<br> Welcome.<br> - Welcome.<br> - Sonya, it's wonderful!<br> Nicholas!<br> You haven't said hello to Sonya yet.<br> What's the sense of coming home<br> from a war, if that's all you do?<br> - Good morning.<br> - Ah, my pipe.<br> Rostov, wake up!<br> - Why, is it late?<br> - "It's 10 o'clock. Get up, Nicholas!"<br> Directly.<br> Is this your sabre? Or yours?<br> Get back, you Frenchman!<br> - Here I come!<br> - At last!<br> Why did you stay in bed so long?<br> I've been waiting for you to get up.<br> You're quite a man, aren't you?<br> I'm awfully glad you're my brother.<br> I want to know what men are like.<br> Are you the same as all of them?<br> - Natasha... Sonya's so young.<br> - Sonya's my dearest friend.<br> If she loves someone, she does it<br> for life. She loves us like that.<br> Remember before you went away?<br> She told me you're to forget all that.<br> "I will love him always, but let him<br> be free." Isn't that lovely and noble?<br> - I'll never go back on my word.<br> - But it won't do.<br> Because if you marry her<br> because of a promise,<br> it'll seem you're marrying her because<br> you must, and that wouldn't be right.<br> We'll talk it over later.<br> I'm so glad I have you!<br> - Are you still true to Pierre?<br> - Don't be silly!<br> I'll be a dancer and never marry.<br> Don't tell anyone.<br> Get dressed and we'll have breakfast.<br> Andrei!<br> Did you get my letter?<br> I met the doctor at the last relay point.<br> Are we in time?<br> - Let's hope so. We must pray for her.<br> - What a strange fate.<br> My darling, God is merciful.<br> I love you. I love you all.<br> I've never done any harm to anyone.<br> Why must I suffer so?<br> Andrei, please help me!<br> My boy, you have to leave now.<br> There, there, my dear.<br> No... no!<br> Upon my word, Rostov,<br> if I were to see fifty more operas,<br> I wager I might wind up liking them!<br> But... I do like the intermissions.<br> - I say, Rostov, that one, there.<br> - Yes?<br> She's superb.<br> But wait. Well!<br> - Where's the husband?<br> - Pierre...<br> He spends most of his time<br> in the country nowadays.<br> If I were the husband,<br> I'd come up from the country fast!<br> To the Emperor!<br> Listen, we took the bear<br> to the house of that actress,<br> and when the police tried to arrest us,<br> we tied one of them<br> on the back of the bear<br> and shoved them both into the river!<br> There they were, both swimming,<br> the man and the bear.<br> - Wake up! The party's still young!<br> - Don't be rough with him.<br> Always be polite to the husbands<br> of pretty women.<br> Let's drink to the health<br> of beautiful women!<br> Yes, to the health<br> of lovely women, huh, Pierre?<br> And to their lovers!<br> Here, look at this. It's a new song<br> written about General Kutuzov.<br> - That interests me.<br> - What?<br> I said that interests me.<br> Express your regrets<br> and he'll accept them.<br> No. What is there to talk about?<br> Is everything ready?<br> - No apologies.<br> - First, tell me how to use this thing.<br> It's very simple.<br> You cock it, there's the trigger.<br> Yes, I know, I just forgot.<br> No apologies. None whatever.<br> On the count of three,<br> begin to advance.<br> One, two, three.<br> Get away from here!<br> It's not over!<br> To your barrier! Stay where you are!<br> Cover yourself, you fool!<br> Well, now, the hero!<br> The dashing duellist!<br> My protector!<br> Thank you for defending my honour.<br> You believed that Dolokhov<br> was my lover. What did you prove?<br> That you are a fool! Now I'll be<br> the laughing stock of all Moscow!<br> Everyone will say<br> that you were drunk.<br> Challenging a man that<br> you were jealous of, without cause!<br> A man that is a better man<br> than you are in every way!<br> - We'd better separate.<br> - Separate?<br> That's a charming idea!<br> It's a wonderful idea!<br> It's the best idea you've had<br> in your whole life!<br> We'll separate, but you will pay for it!<br> You'll give me a fortune for it!<br> No!<br> Get out!<br> The count is waiting for you upstairs.<br> - What have you heard?<br> - Dolokhov won't die.<br> Thank God.<br> It's only easier to kill good men.<br> Men like Dolokhov<br> are only good for wars.<br> In between wars, they ought<br> to be locked up in cages. Here.<br> I'd like to leave Moscow.<br> I want to get away from these people<br> who believe it's normal to kill.<br> At the banquet,<br> when Dolokhov made the toast,<br> I looked across at him smiling at me,<br> I was convinced<br> of the guilt of my wife.<br> Is that a reason to kill?<br> Hlene was guilty, not Dolokhov.<br> I might have done the same thing.<br> Maybe it's even certain.<br> There we were, in the snow,<br> facing each other with pistols.<br> - You know who's guilty? I, only I.<br> - Pierre, don't be silly.<br> And you know why? Because<br> I married her without loving her.<br> I had to have her,<br> so I made myself blind.<br> I lied when I said to her, "I love you."<br> Because of that<br> there's Dolokhov stretched in pain,<br> alive only by the grace of God.<br> Because of my weakness, my lie.<br> I'm guilty. I must suffer for it.<br> You must stop thinking like this,<br> or it'll become an obsession.<br> Look, if you'll agree,<br> we'll all go to our place in the country.<br> And Nicholas wants to show it<br> to Denisov. Come with us?<br> Of course you'll come.<br> I'll tell the family. Mama!<br> Natasha, Sonya, Petya! Hurry!<br> We start for the country tonight.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> Pierre was here?<br> We must start while the moon is high.<br> Ilya, what has happened?<br> What moon are you speaking of?<br> Is there more than one, my pet?<br> How long must we wait for Nicholas?<br> I'm happy you made up your mind.<br> The snow will be gone tomorrow!<br> Sonya, hurry.<br> - Order the troikas.<br> - Immediately!<br> We're off! Hurry, Nicholas,<br> you're delaying the trip to the country.<br> - The country?<br> - You can show Denisov. Come on!<br> - You'll like this.<br> - I was just beginning to enjoy Moscow!<br> Faster, faster, faster!<br> Faster, Nitka!<br> As we ride in the troika, you and I<br> Stars are twinkling up in the sky<br> Strains of sweet balalaika soft and low<br> Sleigh bells tinkling across the snow<br> Hold me close and kiss me, Katiusha<br> Let's be happy and gay, hey!<br> When I'm gone you'll miss me, Katiusha<br> Miss me many a day!<br> Nicholas!<br> - Come on, Pierre, it's your turn now!<br> - Hurry, hurry!<br> Young Nicholas!<br> Petya!<br> Ever since Nicholas joined the army,<br> he's become terribly efficient.<br> - I quite agree with you.<br> - Just a minute...<br> That's my friend, Prince Andrei<br> Bolkonsky. Can he join us?<br> - By all means!<br> - Do ask him.<br> Come on, Natasha!<br> Greetings! Good to see you.<br> I didn't know you were in the country.<br> The Rostovs invite you<br> to join the hunt.<br> I'm afraid anyone else's society would<br> give me more pain than pleasure.<br> Prince Andrei, may I present<br> the Countess Rostova.<br> And her brother, Petya Rostov.<br> I hope Pierre's convinced you to come.<br> It's the year's best hunt.<br> The huntsman's found a wolf<br> and cubs. We'd be so delighted if...<br> What I mean is you would enjoy it.<br> Perhaps I'll join you later.<br> - And stay to dinner?<br> - Possibly.<br> But you just said...<br> - Shall I come now?<br> - Wonderful!<br> - I'm glad you stayed tonight.<br> - So am I.<br> - The Rostovs are charming, no?<br> - Charming.<br> It's wonderful to watch them together,<br> like a race of handsome, healthy,<br> thoughtless animals.<br> - Thoughtless?<br> - Their most charming characteristic.<br> - All of them?<br> - All of them.<br> No.<br> Within a year or two,<br> Natasha will begin to think.<br> It'll make her even more charming<br> but less of a Rostov. Follow?<br> I think so.<br> Andrei, I think it's bad for you,<br> it's wrong to stay down here,<br> year after year, brooding,<br> living the life of a hermit.<br> Bad? Wrong?<br> Only two things in this life<br> are really wrong, Pierre,<br> remorse and illness, and<br> when I've recovered from them both,<br> - I'll go out in the world again.<br> - Why are you remorseful?<br> I was too late.<br> I let Lise die feeling unloved.<br> I was too busy on the trail of glory<br> to take the time to comfort my wife.<br> Well, I found glory.<br> I stopped the retreat of 100 men<br> for five minutes.<br> I was left for dead on a lost battlefield<br> in a lost war.<br> I'll stop being a hermit,<br> when I can forget all those things.<br> Well, I think I'd better go to bed now.<br> Goodnight, Pierre.<br> And thank you again.<br> Goodnight, Andrei.<br> - Natasha, come to bed, you'll catch cold!<br> - I can't sleep.<br> After a day like this,<br> it's impossible to sleep.<br> Come and see the moon.<br> Look how glorious it is.<br> - Sonya?<br> - Yes?<br> - Do you think Prince Andrei likes us?<br> - Of course.<br> He's so silent. It's as though<br> he's passing judgement on us.<br> - I'm frightened of him, aren't you?<br> - No.<br> I'm a little frightened, and yet<br> I wanted to take him by the hand,<br> look in his eyes and sing just for him.<br> Poor man, he'd never come again<br> if I'd done that.<br> Did you notice<br> he almost never smiles?<br> While I was singing,<br> I caught him looking at me.<br> He was smiling then.<br> And I felt...<br> It's almost impossible to describe.<br> I felt as if someone had given me<br> the most enormous, beautiful present.<br> - Come to bed, Natasha.<br> - You try to spoil everything!<br> On a night like this, I feel like<br> hugging myself tight and flying away!<br> - Take care, you'll fall.<br> - All right.<br> But it's a shame to go in<br> on such a night.<br> It's like hearing wonderful music,<br> and you know it's going to be<br> the most beautiful you've ever heard.<br> And being pulled away<br> and missing it for ever.<br> - For ever.<br> - Natasha!<br> All right.<br> - Nicholas, the expression on my face.<br> - What about it?<br> - Do I look disdainful?<br> - No!<br> - I'm sure I look disdainful.<br> - What for?<br> If I look disdainful, nobody will<br> notice this is my first ever ball.<br> - How's this? Better?<br> - That's much better.<br> Good.<br> You must promise<br> not to dance with me.<br> - No!<br> - No matter if no one says a word to me.<br> - Promise not to dance with me.<br> - Why?<br> Because it would be humiliating<br> if only my brother asks me to dance...<br> ...out of pity.<br> - Promise?<br> - I promise.<br> - Nicholas, is everybody looking at me?<br> - Can't you see for yourself?<br> Not without changing the expression<br> on my face.<br> - There's one awful thing about you.<br> - Tell me! The whole truth!<br> No girl I'll ever meet<br> will be able to amuse me like you.<br> Don't talk like that.<br> Go and leave us to our fate.<br> - Nicholas, look after your mother.<br> - Comfortable, Mother?<br> Yes, my darling.<br> What a horrible mistake.<br> I shouldn't have come.<br> Nothing is going to happen.<br> The night is going to be one horrible,<br> black, degrading zero.<br> Count Denilov, meet my family.<br> Madame Maria Peronskaya.<br> You know my wife.<br> My niece, Sonya,<br> and my daughter, Natasha.<br> May I have the pleasure?<br> Oh, dear.<br> Perhaps I shall be more fortunate<br> later on. I shall try again.<br> - "Adieu."<br> - "Au revoir."<br> Denilov is our hostess' first cousin,<br> worth millions!<br> Second cousin, dear.<br> Ah, there's the French ambassador!<br> He looks as if he were a king.<br> You're rather late, you know?<br> Most of my dances are gone.<br> Why must I keep thinking<br> of Prince Andrei?<br> Am I so much in love with him<br> that all others seem ridiculous?<br> We saw so little of each other,<br> and yet I remember every moment.<br> If only he could have<br> brought me here tonight.<br> Why doesn't he like the city?<br> It isn't right for a man<br> to shut himself off as he does.<br> I am so delighted to see you again.<br> Will you honour me with this dance?<br> - Pierre, nice to see you.<br> - Pierre, my boy.<br> Will you honour me with this dance?<br> - Don't you just love dances?<br> - Not ordinarily.<br> - This is my first in two years.<br> - I'm so glad you did come.<br> I mean... Mama and Papa said it was<br> nice for you to visit after the hunt...<br> Tell them I intend to come and visit often.<br> - Very often, if they'll permit me.<br> - I shall tell them.<br> On moonlit nights, do you still want<br> to fly off to the moon?<br> - Where did you hear?<br> - My window was just below yours.<br> What a disaster! You heard everything.<br> No. You disappeared too soon.<br> - You must think I'm an utter idiot.<br> - No.<br> I don't think you're an idiot. I think...<br> Permit me. May I have<br> the pleasure of this dance?<br> Thank you.<br> What a joy it is to dance with her.<br> Like holding springtime in your arms.<br> Like holding a branch of lilac,<br> or a kitten.<br> Look at her now.<br> If she looks back at me<br> and smiles on the next turn,<br> she'll be my wife.<br> Guide us with thine infinite wisdom...<br> ...teach us to abide in thy mercy,<br> and if it be thy will,<br> let this bed be my grave.<br> - I must talk to you just once more.<br> - Well, well...<br> It's about Prince Andrei, I suppose?<br> Thursday, Friday,<br> Saturday, Sunday, Monday...<br> Five days he hasn't been heard from.<br> First, he comes to see me every day<br> and quite turns my head,<br> then nothing happens.<br> Now, I'll tell you about myself<br> when I was young.<br> I had a cousin,<br> a handsome young man.<br> Yes, really handsome.<br> I know. Cyril Matveich.<br> - Must everything end up in nothing?<br> - You're being impulsive.<br> You must be patient. Very patient.<br> Wait till a proper proposal has been<br> made to you. He'll show up.<br> The last time, his proposal was<br> on the tip of his tongue.<br> He seemed so in love.<br> I'm always a little afraid<br> in his presence. What does it mean?<br> Does it mean that it's real love?<br> - Are you asleep?<br> - No, my pet.<br> I'm a little frightened myself.<br> - Now go.<br> - All the same, I shan't sleep.<br> Such a thing has never happened<br> to me before.<br> Could we ever<br> have thought it last spring<br> that we should meet at the ball?<br> It must be fate.<br> Clearly, it must be fate,<br> if everything led up to this.<br> Need one be ashamed of a widower?<br> No, darling, pray to God.<br> Marriages are made in heaven.<br> Mama, how I love you. I'm so happy!<br> Little Countess, are you asleep?<br> Yes, dear, I'm asleep. Goodnight.<br> Marry? Marry?<br> As though life were not<br> complicated enough as it is!<br> In such a hurry! You thought you<br> knew what you were doing last time!<br> - This is completely different.<br> - It always is!<br> Before I met her, life was sad,<br> meaningless, hopeless.<br> When you're over thirty, a man's life<br> should be sad and hopeless!<br> - Father...<br> - All right, all right.<br> Let's be reasonable.<br> Her family is nothing.<br> Nothing, compared to the Bolkonskys.<br> Her father was known<br> to chase every woman in Moscow.<br> Without success!<br> Now that he's grown older,<br> he's known to play<br> in every card game in Moscow.<br> Equally without success!<br> They're a happy family.<br> That's a success, too.<br> Perhaps the greatest success.<br> But you think<br> you're being fair to the girl?<br> You're much older than she.<br> You have a son to bring up.<br> Who'll take the responsibility?<br> A little chit of a girl?<br> I beg of you, put it off for just one year<br> and go abroad.<br> There's a peace mission to Prussia<br> for the signing of a treaty.<br> I know you wanted to go<br> on the mission.<br> After a year, if you still have this love<br> or obstinacy, you marry her.<br> That is my last word on the subject.<br> It's my last word!<br> Is it possible that I, Natasha, will be<br> the wife of this strange, dear man,<br> whom even my father looks up to?<br> Can it be true that there can be<br> no more playing with life?<br> That on me now lies the responsibility<br> of my every word and deed?<br> I have loved you<br> from the first moment I saw you.<br> - Do you love me?<br> - Yes, yes!<br> What is it? What's the matter?<br> I'm so happy.<br> - Did your mother explain?<br> - There's nothing to explain.<br> She told you it can't be for a year?<br> You're young, I want you to be sure.<br> - I am sure.<br> - One year's not long and you'll be free.<br> Lf, within that year,<br> you find you don't love me...<br> Don't say anything like that again!<br> - A year? I'm not going to see you?<br> - Of course.<br> - I must go to Poland for a few months.<br> - Is there nothing that can be done?<br> It's awful, I'll die waiting a year!<br> It's impossible, it's...!<br> No. I'll do anything, whatever you say.<br> We have the rest of our lives!<br> At Tilsit in Prussia,<br> on June 13th 1807,<br> Napoleon met with<br> Emperor Alexander of Russia,<br> for the purpose<br> of discussing a treaty of peace.<br> They can't help liking me.<br> I'm so willing<br> to do anything they wish.<br> So ready to be fond of him<br> for being his father.<br> - I'm Mary Bolkonsky.<br> - Charmed. My daughter, Natasha.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Good afternoon.<br> Excuse my father. He's not well<br> and asks me to welcome you.<br> Some tea?<br> - That would be...<br> - No, thank you.<br> No, thank you.<br> I suppose you've heard from Andrei?<br> Yes.<br> Father!<br> You're the young Countess Rostov.<br> I didn't know<br> you were paying me a visit.<br> Excuse my costume,<br> I came to speak to Mary.<br> Why wasn't I told?<br> Count Rostov? I've heard a great deal<br> about you, a great deal about you.<br> As the Lord is my witness,<br> nobody told me they were here.<br> This house, utter confusion, chaos!<br> People coming and going.<br> You can't find anything.<br> Even the papers in my desk.<br> You must excuse me.<br> I'm not prepared to entertain.<br> I can't stand Moscow, anyhow.<br> I wouldn't be here, except I've no<br> alternative. I'm forced to be here.<br> We'd better leave now. Princess.<br> Wait, I must talk to you.<br> Dear Natasha, I'm certain my brother<br> has found happiness.<br> Princess, I think it is not convenient<br> to speak of that now.<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> Aren't you glad you came?<br> Until Andrei comes back,<br> I can't be glad about anything.<br> It's only a few weeks.<br> - You see that tall man over there?<br> - What about him?<br> When we passed, I heard him say,<br> "That's the Countess Rostov.<br> "The one who's going to marry<br> Bolkonsky. Lucky man."<br> - He said, "Lucky man"?<br> - "Lucky man."<br> I must write that to Andrei.<br> He can tell his horrible father.<br> - Countess Bezukhov has arrived.<br> - Bezukhov?<br> One of my favourites!<br> I must call on her.<br> Countess Bezukhov, I'm delighted<br> to see you back in Moscow.<br> The city hasn't been the same<br> in your absence.<br> I've brought my two girls with me,<br> as you can see.<br> Well...<br> Magnificent woman!<br> You can understand<br> how men must fall in love with her.<br> Dolokhov, see the girl in that box?<br> Yes, she's lovely, but...<br> ...for you? No, Anatole,<br> she's not exactly your type.<br> May I borrow your daughter<br> to sit with me in the next act?<br> Countess, how charming.<br> Natasha, come along.<br> - Isn't it exciting?<br> - Yes.<br> Enchanting! You mustn't bury her<br> in the country again.<br> You're too kind. Natasha, sit down.<br> Now we can tear<br> all our friends to pieces.<br> No one in the theatre is talking<br> of anyone but you and your match.<br> - You know?<br> - It's the news of the season.<br> Prince Andrei Bolkonsky!<br> Every woman here is jealous of you<br> at this moment.<br> Why, Anatole!<br> May I present my brother?<br> Countess Natasha Rostov.<br> He's the centre of fashion in Moscow.<br> He drinks too much<br> and plays for too high stakes.<br> He also sees<br> the most amusing people.<br> Get him to tell you<br> everything to do this season.<br> - Countess!<br> - You've been neglecting me.<br> I was convinced you were dead.<br> When I saw you at the ball,<br> six weeks ago,<br> I thought, "What a pretty girl."<br> That's all I thought.<br> But tonight...<br> - But you felt it, too?<br> - I felt...?<br> When our eyes met. Don't look guilty.<br> What's there to be ashamed of?<br> Are you enjoying the opera?<br> It's very good, isn't it?<br> Oh, is it? I haven't noticed.<br> I haven't looked at the stage tonight.<br> I must see you again.<br> You must come to my sister's house.<br> Very soon.<br> I think...<br> My mother's in the country,<br> I may go up to be with her.<br> She's enchanting.<br> - Go away, Anatole, you'll distract us.<br> - All right, all right.<br> You'll come.<br> I'll take this as a pledge.<br> My brother is very amusing, isn't he?<br> Bravo, bravo!<br> How lovely she is.<br> I don't think so when I look at you.<br> Natasha, come!<br> - Did you enjoy it?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> You're enchanting.<br> From the moment I saw you,<br> I never ceased worshipping you.<br> - I hope you don't think us too informal.<br> - Oh, Countess, well...<br> I'm madly in love with you.<br> - Papa, we must leave.<br> - We can't go now.<br> ...like one big heart,<br> palpitating with emotion.<br> His Majesty the King was so moved,<br> tears came streaming down his face...<br> My cloak, please.<br> I can't. You know I can't.<br> "Dearest Natasha, my fate has been<br> sealed, to be loved by you or die.<br> "Your parents won't give you to me<br> for reasons I will reveal only to you.<br> "But if you love me,<br> you need only say the word yes.<br> "Anatole."<br> You're back.<br> How was your evening?<br> Did you amuse yourself?<br> Yes. I made excuses for you.<br> I was worried about you.<br> How's your headache?<br> - You read that letter.<br> - Yes.<br> I'm glad. I couldn't keep it<br> from you any longer.<br> - "You know we love one another."<br> - But Anatole Kuragin?<br> - How happy I am.<br> - And Andrei?<br> You don't know what love is.<br> You don't understand. Listen.<br> How can you love a man for months<br> and suddenly...? Why?<br> You've only seen Anatole three times.<br> It seems to me<br> I've never loved anyone before.<br> I've heard it's happened that way.<br> It's only now I feel such love.<br> I felt he was my master and I his slave<br> and I couldn't help loving him.<br> Yes, whatever he commands,<br> I must do. What can I do?<br> If he loves you, why doesn't<br> he ask your father honestly<br> for your engagement to be broken off?<br> - Why all this secrecy?<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> Whatever his reasons,<br> they are good ones.<br> - I have no will, I love him.<br> - I won't let it come to that.<br> I shall tell.<br> You wouldn't tell anyone. Don't<br> torture me, I can't live without him!<br> What are you saying?<br> Think about your father and Nicholas.<br> I don't love anyone but him.<br> Go, Sonya.<br> I don't want to quarrel with you.<br> Go away!<br> Anatole, where do you mean to take her?<br> They'll find out about that Polish girl<br> you had to marry. It'll mean jail.<br> It will be worth it. Even if it is for<br> one month or one week with that girl.<br> Some things in life<br> are impossible not to have.<br> - The driver you sent for.<br> - A drink. You have to drive far.<br> - Get Metrevna to bring my cloak.<br> - A gypsy girl again?<br> - An elopement.<br> - I like it. Romance, excitement!<br> There is a priest waiting.<br> Don't let anyone stop you.<br> There's a man for you!<br> - You want me?<br> - Now, take this. Listen to me.<br> The girl will be shivering,<br> she'll have forgotten everything.<br> Wrap her up, or she'll stampede<br> back to the house for furs.<br> Papa awakened, Mama screaming,<br> tears, recriminations, challenges!<br> Always keep a young girl warm,<br> my boy.<br> Up with the collar and whoosh!<br> - Take it.<br> - But my coat.<br> I will get you another one someday.<br> All take glasses!<br> Now, comrade and friend of my youth,<br> we've had our fling and revelled,<br> now farewell.<br> - To your health.<br> - To your health!<br> - How sad it is.<br> - Sure.<br> - I still think you shouldn't do it.<br> - So do I.<br> Sonya? Sonya!<br> No, I won't open it.<br> And I've sent for Pierre.<br> I'll hate you for ever for this.<br> Open the door.<br> No, I won't open it.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Your sister can't keep things quiet.<br> - Things such as gossip.<br> - What?<br> I know all about the money<br> you had to send to Poland and why.<br> - It's not true.<br> - You must leave Moscow.<br> Don't tell anyone. Besides your<br> pleasure, there's others' happiness.<br> You'll ruin a whole life<br> for your amusement.<br> Then amuse yourself with women<br> of your own rotten breed.<br> As a man of honour,<br> you can't talk to me that way.<br> - Is it satisfaction you want?<br> - Yes.<br> I take it back. I'd take it back,<br> I'd beg you for forgiveness.<br> Drive this gentleman<br> wherever he wants to go.<br> He's gone.<br> She's in her room.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I came to stop you.<br> - Nothing will stop me.<br> - What do you plan to tell Andrei?<br> - I wrote to him telling him everything.<br> - He's not good enough for you?<br> You crawl after a gambler, a liar,<br> and a notorious womaniser!<br> I'm going to marry him!<br> Whatever he's told you, he's lying.<br> He's married already.<br> It isn't true.<br> Look at me, Natasha.<br> Could I purposely deceive you?<br> - The rumour's all over Moscow.<br> - Who started it?<br> Prince Andrei has sent back<br> all her letters.<br> - That's bad. I am sorry.<br> - She's been quite ill.<br> When she knew you were coming,<br> she insisted upon getting up.<br> Don't tell her everything. One hasn't the<br> heart to scold her. She's to be pitied.<br> I hear he's in Moscow now.<br> Ask him...<br> - Ask him to forgive me.<br> - I will tell him, but...<br> I know that can never be.<br> All is over.<br> Only I'm so tormented<br> by the wrong I've done him.<br> Tell him...<br> Tell him I beg him to forgive...<br> forgive me for everything.<br> I will tell him everything.<br> But remember I'm your friend.<br> If you want help<br> or to open your heart to someone,<br> not now, but when your mind is clearer,<br> think of me.<br> - I shall be happy if it's in my power.<br> - I'm not worth it.<br> No. You have your whole life<br> ahead of you.<br> Ahead of me? No. All is over.<br> Nonsense, Natasha.<br> Listen to me, look.<br> Were I not myself, but the handsomest,<br> cleverest man in the world,<br> and if I were free,<br> I would not hesitate for one moment<br> to ask for your hand and your love.<br> - It's not cold, Mishka.<br> - It must be well below zero.<br> - Wonderful.<br> - Where to?<br> Where? I don't know, Mishka.<br> Are you looking at the comet, sir?<br> They say it means war and famine.<br> - All sorts of woes.<br> - Nonsense. Life is beautiful. Go!<br> - Where to? The club?<br> - No.<br> - Home?<br> - No. Just go, Mishka!<br> "If Your Majesty wishes to avoid<br> shedding our people's blood<br> "and consents to the withdrawal<br> of Your Majesty's troops,<br> "I will forget what has happened<br> and agreement will be possible.<br> "Otherwise, I shall be forced<br> to repel an aggression<br> "that has been<br> totally unprovoked by me.<br> "The decision whether to preserve<br> humanity from the disasters of war<br> "lies in Your Majesty's hands.<br> "I am, et cetera, Alexander."<br> So... this letter is very polite.<br> Very eloquent.<br> And it is full of fraternal expressions<br> of devotion from your Czar.<br> Sentiments, which, I assure you,<br> are reciprocated by me.<br> - However, in essence, Colonel...<br> - Bolkonsky.<br> ...Bolkonsky,<br> what does this letter express?<br> It is not for me, as a mere messenger,<br> to express the wishes of the Czar.<br> Come, come, my dear fellow,<br> you must have an opinion. What...?<br> Where? Where have we met before?<br> Your face is familiar to me.<br> On the field at Austerlitz, sire.<br> Austerlitz... Austerlitz...?<br> Yes, I do remember.<br> You were lying<br> with a banner in your hand.<br> Yes, sire.<br> I thought you were dead!<br> Well, well, here you are again.<br> I'm glad to see you.<br> Now, Colonel, this letter,<br> what do you think it represents?<br> It can only represent<br> the Czar's sincere wish to avoid war<br> and to prevent the shedding<br> of both Russian and French blood.<br> A praiseworthy aim,<br> and one in which I completely concur.<br> However, what else<br> would you say was in this letter?<br> Since you press me, sire,<br> for a personal opinion, I would say<br> it is a request for the withdrawal<br> of your troops from our country.<br> A personal opinion! That's how<br> the Czar told his messenger to put it.<br> You personally say withdrawal, do you?<br> Say retreat!<br> I'm a soldier and I use soldiers' words.<br> I am not a fool!<br> I've been asked to put my head into<br> a noose while my enemies conspire!<br> Sire, it is not my opinion when I say<br> the Czar is not your enemy<br> and that he is not conspiring<br> against you.<br> If you read his letter carefully...<br> I will read the letter more carefully<br> and send the Czar my answer later.<br> Goodnight to you, Colonel.<br> Gentlemen, tomorrow at dawn<br> we cross the Neman into Russia.<br> We'll talk of peace... in Moscow!<br> And on 12th June 1812,<br> Napoleon Bonaparte, at the head<br> of an army of 200,000 men,<br> crossed the River Neman into Russia.<br> To combat this aggressive invasion<br> of their homeland,<br> the Russians welcomed the French<br> with a destroyed storehouse,<br> a widely desolated land.<br> Looting, burning!<br> As soon as Napoleon approaches,<br> the peasants run off with their grain.<br> What they can't take with them<br> they burn.<br> If we don't put a stop to it somewhere,<br> it'll be a desert, a scorched earth!<br> We must fight. The army demands it,<br> the Czar demands it.<br> And the people demand it!<br> What does the army want?<br> To be destroyed?<br> Because that would be<br> what would happen if we fought now.<br> Does the Czar want<br> to be brought to his knees?<br> Because that would be<br> what would happen if we fought now.<br> What do the people want?<br> To be the subjects of Napoleon?<br> Because that would be<br> what would happen if we fought now.<br> Gentlemen,<br> I have been put in command<br> to give the army, the Czar<br> and the people what they want.<br> And what they want is to drive the last<br> Frenchman from the soil of Russia!<br> And that I propose to do when I can.<br> - But the looting and the burning...<br> - Let it continue!<br> Let it increase!<br> - Soon they'll be at our gates!<br> - We'll stop him!<br> - They should call up more men!<br> - Kutuzov is afraid!<br> - He's a doddering idiot!<br> - What's wrong with the Emperor?<br> We will show Europe<br> how Russia rises in defence...<br> "Lord God,<br> hear us when we pray to Thee.<br> "Strengthen with Thy might<br> our most gracious sovereign,<br> "Emperor Alexander Pavlovich,<br> "and give him victory over his enemy,<br> as Thou gavest Moses victory,<br> "Gideon over Mideon,<br> David over Goliath.<br> "Smite down our enemies<br> and destroy them swiftly<br> "beneath the feet<br> of Thy faithful servants.<br> "Preserve our army, give a bow<br> of brass to those armed in Thy name<br> "and gird their loins with strength<br> for the fight.<br> "Take up the spear and shield<br> and arise to help us.<br> "Confound those<br> who have devised evil against us.<br> "May they be, before the faces of<br> Thy warriors, as dust before the wind.<br> "May Thy mighty angel<br> confound them and put them to flight.<br> "Let them fall<br> before Thy servants' feet<br> "and be laid low by our host."<br> I came to say goodbye.<br> I'm leaving Moscow today.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To the army to fight Napoleon.<br> You're going to join up finally?<br> I don't know...<br> I have to see what it's like,<br> what it means for myself.<br> Prince Andrei is in command<br> of a regiment. I'll find him.<br> - When did you decide to do this?<br> - A long time ago.<br> - Even you, Pierre?<br> - You will stay to dinner?<br> - By all means.<br> - To say goodbye.<br> That's good. Come along.<br> - Lots of my school friends are going.<br> - You must study.<br> - Every man is needed.<br> - Every man not every infant!<br> I can't study<br> when our fatherland is in danger.<br> Be quiet!<br> - You heard from Andrei.<br> - Yes, one letter.<br> Did he...?<br> How is he?<br> Well enough, but sad. His father died.<br> I know. Although his father was<br> my enemy, I prayed for him.<br> He was the first person in the world<br> to disapprove of me.<br> You're not really grown-up<br> until that happens to you.<br> Did Andrei say anything about me<br> in his letter?<br> No, Natasha.<br> Will he ever forgive me?<br> He has nothing to forgive.<br> - You must promise me something.<br> - Yes.<br> Don't let anything happen to you.<br> If it did, I'd...<br> Did you hear me, Pierre?<br> Yes, I heard you.<br> I promise.<br> - And Pierre...<br> - Yes.<br> If you do see Andrei, tell him...<br> Tell him I prayed<br> for the soul of his father.<br> Can you tell me<br> where I'll find Colonel Bolkonsky?<br> This gentleman's<br> been asking to see you.<br> Pierre!<br> Andrei!<br> - At last.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> It's still hard to say.<br> I came to see the battle.<br> Why?<br> It's hard to explain, Andrei.<br> It's such an enormous event.<br> Our lives will be different because<br> of what will happen here tomorrow.<br> - I'm sorry about your father's death.<br> - He was an old man.<br> He couldn't live with the thought<br> of being driven away.<br> How are they taking it in Moscow?<br> Mary has gone to your aunt's.<br> It was Nicholas Rostov<br> who got her out just in time.<br> So Anatole Kuragin did not honour<br> Countess Rostov with his hand.<br> He couldn't. He was married already.<br> It was all very long ago. She's had<br> time to forget her disappointment.<br> - Remember our old discussion...?<br> - Yes.<br> I said a fallen woman should be<br> forgiven. But I can't forgive her.<br> But you can't compare<br> Natasha to a fallen woman.<br> What romantic dreams I had.<br> You mean, ask for her hand again?<br> Yes, that would be very noble.<br> But...<br> I'm sorry.<br> How are you?<br> You seem so strange, disturbed.<br> The night before a battle is fought,<br> men are likely to seem disturbed.<br> It's more than that.<br> Perhaps it is.<br> I've been in many battles, but<br> for the first time I feel I'll die tomorrow.<br> - Nonsense. Why?<br> - I just feel it.<br> Why are you really here, Pierre,<br> when you hate violence and war?<br> I don't know.<br> Because I realised you can't hate<br> something you've never known.<br> How will the battle go?<br> Our position's good.<br> Success never depends on positions,<br> orders, plans or even on numbers.<br> A battle is won<br> by men determined to win it.<br> Despite those men at headquarters<br> who consider war a game,<br> war is the most horrible thing in life,<br> and I'd never take prisoners.<br> The French are my enemies,<br> they destroyed my home,<br> exiled my sister and my child.<br> Now they hope to destroy Moscow.<br> Taking prisoners is playing at war.<br> Take no prisoners! Kill and be killed!<br> Without playing at war, we'd fight only<br> when it was certain death, as now.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Why should I burden you with all this?<br> If we're both alive tomorrow night,<br> we'll have a bottle and laugh.<br> Forgive me, you're sleepy.<br> Time for me to sleep, too.<br> I'd like to stay here.<br> Go. Go!<br> I have no time for you now.<br> My only friends now are the men<br> who'll fight at my side tomorrow.<br> Goodbye.<br> Whether we meet again or not.<br> Take down a proclamation<br> to all troops.<br> Soldiers, this is the battle<br> you have all longed for.<br> Victory depends on you.<br> It will give us all we need.<br> And a speedy return to our country.<br> Act as you did at Austerlitz,<br> Friedland, Vitebsk and Smolensk!<br> Let posterity say with pride<br> of each of you,<br> "He was in the great battle<br> before Moscow."<br> - What is Paris saying?<br> - All Paris regrets your absence.<br> I should say they do. What's in there?<br> - A surprise.<br> - What's that?<br> A present from the Empress<br> for Your Majesty.<br> My son.<br> The King of Rome.<br> Admirable.<br> Take him away, De Beausset.<br> It is too soon for him<br> to see a field of battle.<br> Follow me, De Beausset!<br> You must not leave. Stay and<br> we'll give you something to tell Paris!<br> Fire!<br> There's a lot of wind up there.<br> It's made of iron!<br> Get down or next time it won't be<br> your hat that blows off.<br> - Excuse me. I didn't realise.<br> - Number 3, you're too slow!<br> Ready, fire!<br> You can't stand here,<br> you're in the way.<br> I'll try to keep out of everybody's way.<br> Up with your sights, you're firing low.<br> Number 5, quicker with the charges!<br> - You're not afraid?<br> - Are you?<br> They have no mercy, when they<br> come singing over. Heaven help us.<br> Ready. Fire!<br> - Having a pleasant morning, sir?<br> - Interesting morning.<br> Interesting?<br> You hear that, mates? Interesting!<br> - Here comes a live one!<br> - Not this way. Towards the infantry!<br> Found your friend, eh?<br> Know him well?<br> Beyond the trees, the French infantry<br> are advancing en masse.<br> - Hold your fire!<br> - Hold your fire!<br> Lower your sights<br> and wait for the order to fire!<br> Fire!<br> Sire, our infantry regiments<br> have turned back and are retreating.<br> The cavalry should have gone first<br> to clear the way. Send them now!<br> - There's only four more charges, sir.<br> - Bring up more.<br> I'll go, too.<br> Water.<br> Take me to a dressing station.<br> Help me.<br> Doctor, he needs help.<br> - How far have you carried him?<br> - I don't know.<br> You should have saved yourself<br> the trouble. He's dead.<br> Damn you, Napoleon.<br> Damn you to hell!<br> Well, we've stood our ground.<br> We've taken the worst<br> that Napoleon has to offer.<br> We must attack tomorrow morning.<br> You agree, sir?<br> Yes, I agree. Theoretically.<br> According to all the rules that<br> we've ever learned about warfare,<br> we must attack tomorrow morning,<br> but we cannot attack.<br> - We're too exhausted to attack.<br> - But if we retreat...<br> We give the ground to the enemy.<br> But he has paid too high a price for it.<br> He will bleed to death from this victory.<br> But we can't make a stand<br> before Moscow.<br> Yes, General, you're right.<br> You mean to abandon Russia's<br> ancient and sacred capital?<br> Russia's ancient and sacred capital.<br> Let me tell you, that question<br> has no meaning for a Russian.<br> Such a question cannot be put.<br> It's senseless!<br> The question I've asked you<br> to discuss is a military one!<br> The question is of saving Russia.<br> Do we give up Moscow or accept battle<br> and lose the army and Moscow?<br> Well, I see I am the one who<br> has to pay for the broken crockery.<br> Gentlemen, I've heard your views.<br> Some of you will not agree with me.<br> But I, by the authority entrusted<br> to me by my sovereign and country...<br> ...order a retreat.<br> Oh, faster! The French will be here<br> before we're ready to leave.<br> Now, come on, up!<br> Put all the glass things<br> in the front wagons.<br> And the books... put them<br> in the low wagons.<br> Take this and this. And these gloves.<br> I'll never wear them again.<br> Thank you.<br> They are the wounded from Borodino.<br> Vera, hurry!<br> Vera, come!<br> Give me some water.<br> - Have you seen the wounded men?<br> - Yes. I said they can live here.<br> Someone badly wounded?<br> Just about alive. It's a miracle<br> His Excellency has lasted this long.<br> - His Excellency?<br> - Our colonel.<br> Miss Sonya.<br> Don't tell anyone about this. Not yet.<br> Promise me.<br> Aunt, Prince Andrei is here,<br> among the wounded.<br> - Andrei?<br> - He's unconscious, terribly wounded.<br> - Natasha?<br> - She doesn't know.<br> - She mustn't know.<br> - He's dying.<br> Natasha must not know.<br> All right, get those wagons moving.<br> Turn them around!<br> We've got another load of wounded<br> back there!<br> After we've left and<br> the wounded are here, what then?<br> I don't know. My orders are to get<br> back and pick up more wounded.<br> They're to be left here, deserted,<br> to be taken prisoner, to die?<br> - That's in other hands than ours.<br> - Take those chairs down.<br> - That's enough. Put it down.<br> - Papa, we can't do this.<br> - Oh, the settee...<br> - The three men will become prisoners.<br> What three men?<br> But of course. If we leave the settee,<br> what will happen to your mother?<br> - I'll speak to Mother.<br> - Back in!<br> You three are to come with us<br> on that cart.<br> - Your men must use my house.<br> - Count, please help.<br> - Is there a cart for this poor fellow?<br> - Of course.<br> Hurry, hurry!<br> - All those men, Papa.<br> - I know, it's very sad.<br> - Still, in a war...<br> - We must take them with us.<br> We're going to unload everything<br> and take every man who can travel.<br> You're right. So very right.<br> Take those back. Put that down.<br> Unload all the carts. Do as you're told!<br> - Tell your men there's room for all.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Take those off!<br> Take this off, take it all down.<br> Unload the cart.<br> Unload this cart completely.<br> Overboard with that.<br> Take all that down!<br> Take down that table, we don't need it.<br> Empty the cart straight away.<br> All this out. Come and help!<br> Llya, what is this?<br> They're unloading everything.<br> - To make room for the wounded.<br> - But our things!<br> Things! Things can be bought.<br> Think what it means to be left behind.<br> The government ought to care<br> for the wounded.<br> Mama, you can't object.<br> Look at them.<br> You'd leave them behind<br> to save some furniture? Mama!<br> Suppose Nicholas was one of them.<br> Or Petya.<br> Nicholas? Petya?<br> Of course, you're right, darling.<br> I'm sorry, llya.<br> The chicks are teaching the hen!<br> Ten more minutes!<br> We leave in ten minutes!<br> - I'm ready now, llya.<br> - Come along, girls, in you get.<br> - In God's name, off.<br> - In God's name, off!<br> Dear Moscow, everybody's leaving you.<br> - Look! Over there by the corner!<br> - Who is it?<br> Pierre! Over here! Pierre!<br> Over here, Pierre!<br> You're safe. You promised<br> you'd come back and you have.<br> You mustn't stay. Come with us.<br> - Did you see the battle, Pierre?<br> - Yes, I saw it. I saw too much.<br> - Come with us.<br> - I must stay in the city, I've...<br> - Stop the coach!<br> ...something I must do.<br> Go on!<br> Remember me. Remember!<br> Why wouldn't he come with us?<br> I don't understand.<br> - Natasha...<br> - Sonya!<br> You're crying. For Pierre?<br> For us, because we're leaving?<br> What, then?<br> - I have to tell her.<br> - No.<br> There's someone we know<br> among the wounded.<br> Andrei?<br> He's travelling with us now.<br> Is he badly hurt?<br> Why didn't you tell me before?<br> I didn't know how to tell you.<br> He told you not to tell me.<br> No. He's asleep or unconscious.<br> He didn't speak.<br> He didn't speak?<br> Moscow!<br> Asiatic city of innumerable churches.<br> Lots of them.<br> Moscow the holy, here at my feet.<br> At last!<br> On the ancient monuments<br> of barbarism and despotism,<br> I shall inscribe great words<br> of justice and mercy. Mercy.<br> What a splendid reign the Emperor<br> Alexander's... might have been.<br> Now, I'm ready to accept<br> the surrender of the city. Now.<br> Well, where is the deputation?<br> There is no one, sire.<br> The city is empty, half of it on fire.<br> There is no government.<br> No one to surrender to you.<br> That's impossible.<br> Impossible and ridiculous!<br> There must be a surrender.<br> This is an insult!<br> They're going to pay for this.<br> The skyline, look. It's a village on fire.<br> - It could be Mytishchi.<br> - It's further away than that.<br> - Moscow's on fire!<br> - It's so windy and dry.<br> Moscow! God have mercy.<br> Oh, it's Moscow, poor Moscow.<br> Natasha, Sonya, come and look.<br> Moscow's on fire.<br> Moscow? Oh, no!<br> How terrible!<br> - Natasha!<br> - Let's go back to bed.<br> - I must talk to you.<br> - Again?<br> - Go back to bed.<br> - Give me permission to join the army.<br> You already know it. It's no.<br> I must go where I can do<br> the most good for my country.<br> Your duty now is not what you think.<br> Your duty is to stay with us.<br> I'm sorry, Papa.<br> I've already made up my mind.<br> Do look. The whole city's on fire.<br> You can see it from the window.<br> - You didn't even look.<br> - Yes. Really, I did.<br> Go back to sleep.<br> You'll catch your death of cold.<br> You, too, Natasha, darling.<br> Go to sleep.<br> - Is it the French or us burning the city?<br> - Who knows?<br> Please, your officers, where are they?<br> Officers, Miss?<br> I don't know. Down there somewhere.<br> Forgive me, forgive me.<br> I love you.<br> Forgive me.<br> Forgive what?<br> For everything I have done.<br> I love you more. Better than before.<br> - I want all these fires put out.<br> - Yes, sire.<br> Let me go! Take your hands off me!<br> No!<br> Let me go!<br> - Where did he come from?<br> - I don't know.<br> Ready!<br> Aim!<br> Fire!<br> Cut them down!<br> - Two others, quickly!<br> - No, no! Help me! Please!<br> Please don't let them! No!<br> No! No!<br> Please! No!<br> No!<br> No, please!<br> Ready!<br> Aim!<br> Fire!<br> Cut them down!<br> No, that's all.<br> The orders were to shoot<br> only the incendiaries.<br> Take them back to prison.<br> Forward march!<br> Don't brood. It's not for us to judge<br> whether we're to be spared or not.<br> Finally, in the world to come,<br> God will give us a word of explanation.<br> Here you are. Come here, boy.<br> You found me again, eh?<br> That's the little fella. That's right.<br> Sit down there, be a good boy.<br> Do you like cold potatoes?<br> At dinner the potatoes were delicious.<br> Here you are, boy.<br> Perhaps you'd like some salt.<br> - That's better now, huh?<br> - I'm all right.<br> - Why did they have to shoot them?<br> - What a sin. What a sin.<br> Where there's law, there's injustice.<br> Come on, boy, get up.<br> But the maggot eats the cabbage<br> yet dies first.<br> What?<br> Things happen not as we plan,<br> but as God judges.<br> Have you got a family estate, sir?<br> A housewife?<br> Your old parents, are they still living?<br> Perhaps you've got little ones?<br> Never mind, you're young yet<br> and may have some still.<br> The great thing is to live in harmony.<br> Well, I was still living at home,<br> you know?<br> We had a well-to-do homestead,<br> a nice piece of land,<br> and a house you'd thank God for.<br> When we went mowing,<br> we were seven. Real peasants.<br> Well, one day, I went into someone<br> else's forest to cut wood.<br> The keeper found me, I was flogged<br> and sent to serve as a soldier.<br> We thought that was a misfortune,<br> but it turned out to be a blessing.<br> If I hadn't sinned, my brother would've<br> gone and he's got five little ones.<br> Whereas I only had a wife to leave.<br> We had a little girl,<br> but God took her before I left.<br> You've had hard luck.<br> We can make it into misery or into joy.<br> Hard luck's like water in a dragnet,<br> you pull and it bulges.<br> But when you've drawn it out,<br> there's nothing in it.<br> That's how it is, dear boy.<br> Now I think it's time to sleep.<br> Lord Jesus Christ, Holy Saint Nicholas,<br> Frola and Lavra have mercy upon us.<br> That's the way.<br> Lay me down like a stone<br> and raise me up like a loaf.<br> - What prayer was that?<br> - I was praying. Don't you pray?<br> Yes. But what did you say?<br> Frola and Lavra?<br> The horse's saints.<br> One must pity the animals, too.<br> Come over here.<br> Get warm and lie down.<br> That's right.<br> - I thought you were asleep.<br> - No. I was watching you.<br> Enjoying you. Being thankful for you.<br> - Sleep, my dearest.<br> - No, not yet.<br> I want to keep my eyes open.<br> I want to look at you.<br> You know, you're not the girl<br> I saw dancing all night.<br> The girl who whispered<br> on the balcony to the moon.<br> You're something much better.<br> How serene you are. How valuable.<br> I love you so much.<br> It's a terrible thing. Only at a moment<br> like this can one talk so openly.<br> Until now, I knew nothing about love.<br> I was a great hater, Natasha.<br> I hated so many things,<br> but most of all I hated you.<br> You had every right.<br> I love you more than I've ever loved<br> anything on this earth.<br> Maybe this monastery<br> has something to do with it.<br> Maybe the monks<br> really know about love.<br> Now I'm beginning to understand, too.<br> Maybe death<br> is my private monastery.<br> Where is he? Can I see him?<br> - Of course. But is that his son?<br> - Yes.<br> - And he's called...?<br> - Kolya.<br> What a lovely boy.<br> - Where is he?<br> - We've sent to ask.<br> You must be tired, Princess.<br> We've prepared rooms for you.<br> - Where is Petya?<br> - He left. We couldn't control him.<br> He kept on about going into the army<br> until we just had to let him go.<br> The war will probably be over<br> before he gets his commission.<br> - Did you receive my letter?<br> - Yes, that was a good piece of news.<br> - You and Mary.<br> - I'm worried about Sonya.<br> - It's all right, I told her immediately.<br> - But I wanted to tell her myself.<br> - Mary.<br> - Will you stay with us, little man?<br> Now, my dear...<br> Come with me, Mary.<br> Nicholas, you come along.<br> - Nicholas, I've read your letter.<br> - I know.<br> She's a fine woman, isn't she?<br> - If you want to, Nicholas, you're free.<br> - Forgive me, Sonya.<br> Natasha, no one will tell me anything.<br> How is his wound, his condition?<br> What did the doctor say?<br> Is he worse?<br> - Andrei.<br> - Hello, Mary.<br> How did you manage to get here?<br> Have you brought little Kolya?<br> - How are you now?<br> - You must ask the doctor.<br> You see how strangely<br> fate has brought us together?<br> - She looks after me all the time.<br> - Mary came from Ryazan.<br> - You've missed Count Nicholas?<br> - Yes.<br> He took a great liking to you.<br> It would be a good thing to marry him.<br> Why talk of me, Andrei?<br> Would you like to see Kolya?<br> He's outside.<br> I'd be very glad to see him.<br> Is it too much for you, all this talking?<br> No. I want to tell Mary<br> so many things but I'm unable to.<br> Kiss him, Kolya. Kiss your father.<br> Kolya...<br> ...no one is permitted to cry<br> in this room.<br> Not children and not grown-ups either.<br> I think you'd better<br> go out and play now.<br> He's a handsome little boy.<br> What is it, Mary? Is it about the child?<br> You know the gospel.<br> "The fouls of the air sow not, nor reap,<br> yet your father feedeth them."<br> That's why you mustn't cry.<br> Come sit beside me.<br> The hardest thing<br> is to keep alive at sunset.<br> I had a wonderful dream.<br> I saw a door. I could see beyond it.<br> I dreamt that I died.<br> And as I died, I awoke.<br> Yes...<br> ...death is an awakening, you see?<br> It's all so simple.<br> Is it over?<br> Where is he now?<br> Where has he gone?<br> What is this? What is this?<br> We are masters of the capital<br> of the largest country in the world,<br> not a single civilian mouth to feed<br> and I get these reports!<br> "The stocks are dwindling,<br> food is disappearing,<br> "the danger point is approaching."<br> Who writes out these reports?<br> Who is taking steps to correct them?<br> I brought the greatest army<br> in Europe into this city.<br> What do I see?<br> A mob of looters and drunkards.<br> They are not soldiers any more!<br> They are rag-pickers. Junk men!<br> Kutuzov must have sent emissaries<br> to ask for the terms of surrender.<br> What happened?<br> Are they detained? Shot?<br> Sire, I myself have given explicit<br> instructions to all the commanders.<br> There have been no emissaries from<br> the Russian Commander-in-Chief.<br> The city's burning down<br> around our ears. House by house!<br> I've given orders to shoot incendiaries<br> and even here, you cannot...<br> ...cannot get the stink of smoke<br> out of your nostrils!<br> Gentlemen, take hold or<br> I promise you I will replace you all!<br> With all your titles<br> and decorations and batons!<br> I'll go and pick the first soldiers I find<br> who are not drunk...<br> ...and put them in your place!<br> I warn you, gentlemen,<br> I cannot sit here much longer,<br> watching my army decay.<br> Close the windows, someone!<br> Already the wild geese<br> are flying south.<br> What if we are trapped here<br> through winter?<br> Time and patience,<br> patience and time.<br> The grand army's wounded,<br> but is it mortally wounded?<br> An apple should not be plucked<br> while it's green.<br> Patience and time.<br> Yes? Who is it? Come in!<br> A special courier, Your Excellency.<br> Excellency, the French are preparing<br> to leave Moscow.<br> Come closer.<br> Excellency, would you like me to...?<br> O Lord, my creator.<br> Thou hast heard our prayer.<br> Russia is saved!<br> I thank Thee, O Lord.<br> Russian women.<br> They're the lice<br> that live on the conquerors.<br> They have to leave with them or die.<br> Attack.<br> The word "attack"<br> is always on your tongues.<br> Gentlemen, they came<br> into our country like locusts,<br> leaving nothing behind,<br> food nor shelter.<br> Now they are going back the way<br> they came, through the desolation.<br> A cold, hungry army,<br> doing what every Russian wants,<br> leaving our country<br> with all possible speed.<br> The country is destroying them.<br> And the Russian army?<br> Since Borodino, we've been in retreat.<br> - Now, it must attack!<br> - For what?<br> I wouldn't give one Russian soldier<br> for ten Frenchmen!<br> Those retreats...<br> ...they've brought about<br> the destruction of the French army.<br> And will bring about the liberation<br> of our country.<br> The animal is running.<br> We will follow it...<br> ...and flick its haunches with whips<br> to encourage it to keep moving.<br> We will follow it<br> to the borders of our country.<br> We will offer the French<br> a golden bridge to the West.<br> Get moving, there! Get moving!<br> All stragglers will be shot!<br> Get up.<br> Get up! Keep moving! Get up!<br> Come on, get into line.<br> - Get up! Come on, get up!<br> - I can't.<br> Get up. Now!<br> Please...<br> All right.<br> ...73, 74...<br> Get up!<br> Get moving!<br> Clear the road! Out of the way!<br> Stand aside! Out of the way!<br> Move on.<br> Move on! Keep moving!<br> - Move on. Move on!<br> - One, two, three...<br> What are you counting all the time?<br> I count to a thousand and start again<br> to keep my feet going.<br> You've never needed them before,<br> have you?<br> Gentlemen ride in carriages<br> or on horseback.<br> I've lived my whole life on foot<br> and yet you outlast me.<br> Start again. One, two...<br> ...24, 25, 26...<br> Get up!<br> Come on, keep moving!<br> Are you afraid, too, friend?<br> One, two, three, four, five...<br> Halt! Who are you?<br> Ensign Rostov. I have a dispatch<br> from the Commander-in-Chief.<br> Come, then.<br> - How did you find us?<br> - Peasants in the village told me.<br> - Dragoons?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - How many infantrymen?<br> - Maybe 100.<br> - Or 200?<br> - Yes, sir. Perhaps 200.<br> Perhaps? Get out<br> before I lose my temper! Out!<br> - When was he captured?<br> - Last night. We won't keep him long.<br> I usually do not take prisoners.<br> - What is this dispatch?<br> - It's my general's dispatch, sir.<br> - Who are you?<br> - Rostov.<br> - You have a brother, Nicholas?<br> - Yes. You know him?<br> Yes.<br> "All patrols are to fall back<br> immediately to join the main army.<br> "Prepare for a general attack<br> "when the French attempt to cross<br> the Beresina River."<br> Rostov, you didn't find me<br> to give me this till tomorrow.<br> Why, sir?<br> Those French stragglers, I'll attack<br> them tomorrow. One last fight.<br> Let me come. I'll say I didn't find you,<br> if you let me fight.<br> - No, no!<br> - Let me come.<br> It's a bargain. But keep out of trouble<br> or I'll be in trouble with the General.<br> Thank you.<br> Go and eat something.<br> Now, I will move in through the forest.<br> You go to the other side of the valley<br> and attack at my signal.<br> - Right. Any reserves?<br> - None.<br> This is our last fight,<br> and we'll hold back nothing.<br> - Ensign. You want some?<br> - Thank you.<br> Hungry? Have this.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Stay behind me at all times.<br> Charge!<br> The Cossacks! The Cossacks!<br> You must've wished<br> you'd killed me in that stupid duel.<br> You probably haven't heard<br> that Hlene died in St Petersburg.<br> Finally, I want to ask you<br> to forgive me for the harm I did you.<br> Halt!<br> Take them away.<br> You know what to do with them.<br> He wouldn't stay behind.<br> It was a game for him.<br> His sabre was a toy.<br> I never take prisoners!<br> Stand by your guns!<br> Stand by your guns!<br> Fire!<br> Yes, burn them.<br> - Hurrah, lads!<br> - Hurrah!<br> Hurrah! Hurrah!<br> I thank you all for your hard<br> and faithful service.<br> The victory is complete,<br> and Russia will not forget you!<br> Honour to you for ever!<br> Hurrah! Hurrah!<br> Well, shall we see what's happened<br> to the rest of the house?<br> Come on, Mary.<br> Sonya, see what the kitchen's like.<br> Prokofy, you might find some tea.<br> - Will you look in the cellar?<br> - Very well.<br> Mama, Papa!<br> The north wing is just as it was!<br> Nothing's happened.<br> We have a house. Half a house!<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> Mama, you can come and rest.<br> We're home.<br> Dunyasha,<br> make Mama a cold compress.<br> Take this footstool.<br> She always liked that.<br> The baby can go in my room.<br> Up you go! There.<br> I hope we find a bottle of port.<br> You see, Mary? You'll have<br> a born optimist as a father-in-law.<br> I have loved you<br> from the first moment I saw you.<br> Hurry up, Nicholas! You're delaying<br> the trip to the country!<br> Pierre!<br> We were so worried when we heard<br> you were taken prisoner.<br> You've come back.<br> You're like this house.<br> You suffer, you show your wounds,<br> but you stand.<br>
