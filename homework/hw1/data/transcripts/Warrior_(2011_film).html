                        Hey, Jenny.<br> That was a wonderful share, tonight.<br> "Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck.<br> "Enter Ahab. Then, all.<br> "It was not a great while<br> after the affair of the pipe,<br> "that one morning, shortly after breakfast,<br> Ahab, as was his wont,<br> "ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.<br> "It's a white whale, I say," resumed Ahab,<br> as he threw down the top-maul.<br> "A white whale.<br> Skin your eyes for him, men,<br> "look sharp for white water,<br> if ye see but a bubble, sing out. "<br> Tommy?<br> Jesus!<br> What are you doing here?<br> Well, I was just passing through<br> and I figured why not have a belt<br> with the old man.<br> Yeah.<br> She looks good.<br> Yeah, she's hanging in there.<br> Well, you always did take good care of her.<br> Paddy Conlon.<br> Man of priorities.<br> I got a little something for you.<br> Mom always said,<br> "Never go anywhere empty-handed."<br> She did.<br> That's not for me anymore, Tommy.<br> What? You changed brands?<br> Let's go inside, huh?<br> Tommy!<br> Come on, let's go inside.<br> I like what you've done with the place.<br> Yeah, I appreciate that.<br> There's not much of a woman's touch<br> around here.<br> Yeah, well...<br> And no more women for me, Tommy.<br> Yeah.<br> It must be hard to find a girl<br> who can take a punch nowadays.<br> Here you go.<br> Coffee?<br> You haven't seen a guy in 14 years<br> and you're not gonna have a drink with him?<br> - Come on.<br> - I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.<br> I'm coming up on 1,000 days.<br> - Come on, it's just a drink.<br> - No.<br> He's a school teacher down in Philly.<br> Remember Tess?<br> They had two beautiful little girls.<br> So, you found God, huh? That's awesome.<br> I think Mom kept calling out for him,<br> but he wasn't around.<br> I guess Jesus was down at the mill<br> forgiving all the drunks, huh?<br> Who knew?<br> So, you gonna ask about her,<br> or you just gonna sit there all sober?<br> - I know.<br> - You know? What do you know? Huh?<br> Do you know it wasn't enough to drive west<br> to get away from you,<br> that once we hit the water,<br> we drove north, too?<br> When I got sober, I hired a man to find you.<br> And is that one of the 12 steps?<br> Or does a guy like you get 24?<br> Just 12.<br> Did your guy tell you<br> what you needed to know?<br> Just that your mother died in Tacoma.<br> But you were in the Marines.<br> That was all.<br> That was enough.<br> Well, that's too bad,<br> 'cause you could've gotten<br> some good details.<br> You could've heard about her<br> coughing up blood on her knees<br> in a shit box with no heat.<br> Having me rub her down with holy water,<br> because, well, she didn't have no insurance.<br> All the time waiting for your pal,<br> Jesus, to save her.<br> Did your man tell you that?<br> I'm sorry, Tommy.<br> Well, it's good to know<br> that you're sorry, Pop.<br> It goes a long way.<br> I think I liked you better<br> when you were a drunk.<br> All right, then. All right, all right, all right.<br> You say I can, but you say I can't.<br> - What about if we all get a unicorn?<br> - No.<br> - Don't you want a unicorn?<br> - No.<br> What's going on up here?<br> - Oh, my goodness.<br> - Well, I'm not sure,<br> but I think Daddy is now a princess.<br> - Daddy, you look so handsome.<br> - Do I?<br> - He's a very pretty princess.<br> - We're painting Daddy's face.<br> Yeah, you are.<br> Okay. Yeah.<br> Em, you wanna open your presents?<br> - Yeah? You wanna do present time? Okay.<br> - Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?<br> - All right!

What is it?<br> Let's start with this one.<br> How about that, Emily?<br> - All right.<br> - Happy birthday, Emily.<br> - What did you get? What did you get?<br> - Babe?<br> It's an awfully big box.<br> It's her birthday. Come on.<br> I know, babe,<br> but that's why you call it a budget.<br> You set it and you don't budge.<br> - This one's mine.<br> - Hey, open the big box!<br> It's okay.<br> - I love you. Be good, okay?<br> - Bye, Mommy.<br> Daddy's gonna give you a bath.<br> - Hey, babe. I'm late.<br> - Hey.<br> Mom's saying goodbye to the girls,<br> she's got to get on the road.<br> - They've been fed, they just need a bath.<br> - I'm on it.<br> Okay, can you get them to bed<br> at a reasonable time tonight?<br> Because, after the party,<br> they're just exhausted.<br> Where's the rest of that skirt?<br> Babe.<br> Listen, if any guys give you a hassle<br> in that joint tonight,<br> you give me a call, okay?<br> Yeah, just like you gave me a call<br> when those Temple frat boys<br> decided to smash up your face.<br> I told you, most nights,<br> I sit on the stool and grade papers,<br> but, every now and then,<br> I need some action.<br> All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.<br> I'll see what I can do about that.<br> Promises, promises.<br> And we return here on MMA Live,<br> Jon Anik, alongside the billionaire<br> fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,<br> the Tapout crew is here,<br> Punk and Skrape are in the building.<br> Now, J.J., what led to this project<br> that is really redefining<br> mixed martial arts here in the States?<br> Well, mixed martial arts is a sport<br> I've been incredibly passionate about,<br> and as far as where<br> the idea for Sparta came from,<br> I've always really dug the Grand Prix format,<br> so I tracked these guys down.<br> And when J.J. Came to us,<br> he said he wanted to create<br> the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts.<br> And he decided to put up<br> the $5 million purse, too.<br> Well, there you have it, it shall be done.<br> Hedge fund king, J.J. Riley,<br> going from the lions' den of Wall Street<br> to the cage,<br> and promoting the biggest winner-take-all<br> tournament in MMA history. Sparta...<br> Doing good.

There's a lesson in this, too, okay?<br> Hold on, Tito.<br> So, we have a body at rest,<br> and you have the bat which needs...<br> - Acceleration.<br> - Acceleration, okay.<br> If you have enough acceleration,<br> you might have a chance<br> of breaking the body at rest.<br> - Okay. All right. You ready?<br> - Piece of cake.<br> Everybody got the glasses on? Okay, go!<br> Piece of cake!<br> Come on, man!<br> Come on, son!<br> All right! All right. There we go.<br> Well done, Tito. Well done.<br> Remind me not to mess with you.<br> Sit down, everybody. Dial it down.<br> So, have we got it?<br> Force equals mass times acceleration,<br> we got it.<br> All right. Has everybody else got it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yes? Okay, good. All right.<br> The third law...<br> How many laws this dude got?<br> - The dude?<br> - Yes, the dude.<br> The dude has three, all right?<br> Newton, the dude, says that<br> for every action,<br> there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br> For example,<br> if K.C. Does not stop the action<br> of sending texts in class<br> and tell her posse outside to beat it,<br> then my reaction might be<br> to send her down to Principal Zito's office.<br> Thus setting the world back<br> in proper balance.<br> Mr. C, I put it away.<br> All right, before you go,<br> I have your tests from last week.<br> Just work it out.<br> Stop clowning.<br> Pick up the hands.<br> Tighten it up!<br> Use your right.<br> Seal his hands, come on.<br> Seal his hands. Keep your hands up!<br> Go light!<br> I said, go light!<br> God damn it!<br> Where do you find these girls?<br> We got a tournament coming up,<br> you're gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?<br> Oh, jeez.<br> Fenroy, get me some ice.<br> And call that Puerto Rican kid,<br> the one that fights out of the bottoms.<br> If he's here in 20 minutes,<br> he gets 200 bucks.<br> Yo, I'll fight him.<br> Do me a favor, guy, go back to your bag.<br> We don't need anybody else getting hurt.<br> Take a walk.<br> Let's go. Watch his neck.<br> Yo, Rock, what did you do,<br> did you leave Mick and Paulie<br> at home today?<br> His phone's disconnected.<br> Then go through the list.<br> Find me somebody. Get me Joe Bones.<br> All I'm saying is<br> that if you need somebody to help you,<br> I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.<br> You ever fought before?<br> Yeah.<br> Hey, this guy signed a waiver?<br> All good.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Tommy.<br> - You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tom.<br> - Sure, no problem. No problem.<br> Come on in.<br> Let's go. All right, let's go.<br> Hey. Watch that teeth.<br> Are you gonna be a hero? All right.<br> Come on. Check that kick.<br> Easy.<br> Come on, Dog, you can do it.<br> Let's go, come on.<br> - Good jab. Good jab!<br> - There we go!<br> No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.<br> Don't let him take your back!<br> - Dog, get up.<br> - Get up!<br> Cover up, cover up!<br> Don't give him your back.<br> Don't give him your back!<br> - Cover up!<br> - Come on, Dog!<br> Cover up, damn it!<br> You owe me 200 bucks.<br> This one here.<br> See, this is the new appraisal figures<br> - that came in.<br> - Yeah.<br> And this is how it affects the monthly,<br> it turns into that.<br> And the total value of the loan,<br> over the life of the loan, is that.<br> As you can see, that's just the way it is.<br> It puts you upside down,<br> that's the problem.<br> It's the county that did the assessment,<br> not the bank.<br> So, the numbers are what they are,<br> Mr. Conlon...<br> - Brendan.<br> - The numbers are what they are, Brendan.<br> I mean, you're a math teacher, right?<br> You can appreciate that.<br> I'm a physics teacher. I teach physics.<br> Physics, okay. But the bank has got to go<br> by the new appraisal figures.<br> And, according to these figures,<br> you're upside down on your mortgage,<br> - you understand?<br> - God, you said that like three times.<br> I'm sorry, but I get that.<br> I am asking you,<br> is there something else you can do?<br> Not the bank, you.<br> Can you shift things around, restructure?<br> You refinanced twice already.<br> 'Cause you advised us to do that.<br> - You told me.<br> - Well, I presented you with that option,<br> but that was your choice.<br> I'm also showing that you netted<br> a substantial payout with the refi.<br> We had that conversation.<br> I was paying medical bills.<br> Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's kidney?<br> - Heart.<br> - Heart. Right, sorry.<br> A lot of stories.<br> All right, so, if that's my option,<br> I have no options.<br> You're not even gonna try and help me.<br> You're not even gonna try.<br> No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan,<br> I can get you 90 days to get even.<br> Ninety days is not enough.<br> My wife and I,<br> we have three jobs between us.<br> And that doesn't cut it.<br> So, what do you suggest?<br> Well, let me ask you a question?<br> Have you thought about bankruptcy?<br> It's a viable option.<br> There's no shame in this these days.<br> That's not how I do things.<br> Okay, well, then<br> you're looking at foreclosure.<br> Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,<br> the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.<br> The prodigy has yet to yield a single point<br> in the entire tournament.<br> Tommy, trained by his father<br> since the age of five.<br> - Talking about Paddy Conlon?<br> - The controversial Paddy Conlon.<br> Say what you will about the methods<br> of the former Marine,<br> but he's led his son<br> to six straight Junior Olympic titles<br> and now just moments away<br> from a High School State Championship.<br> And there it is! Wow!<br> There's just no limit<br> to what the future holds for this kid.<br> Tommy told me that he's chasing<br> the record of Theogenes,<br> apparently, a mythical Greek fighter<br> said to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.<br> Hi, how're you doing, sir?<br> I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.<br> - Who?<br> - Tommy Riordan.<br> My name is Colt Boyd.<br> What business you got with Tommy?<br> Well, none yet, that's why I'm here.<br> I manage fighters.<br> So, Tommy's been working out at my gym,<br> and he put a beating on the number one<br> middleweight contender in the world today.<br> So, I want to know<br> a little bit more about the guy.<br> Maybe help him out.<br> I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.<br> Conlon. The name is Conlon.<br> And anything you wanna know<br> about Tommy,<br> you gotta ask him yourself.<br> Look, I'm just asking<br> for some general information here.<br> Like I said, anything you wanna know<br> about Tommy,<br> you gotta ask him yourself.<br> Look, I don't mean<br> to interrupt your night, okay?<br> He just put this address down<br> when he signed up at the gym.<br> He doesn't live here.<br> - All right, then.<br> - Okay. Good night.<br> All right, listen, kiddo.<br> I need you to put Mommy back on, okay?<br> I love you.<br> Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling in,<br> I'm gonna have to go.<br> No, they got an open mic night thing on,<br> it's gonna be a quiet one.<br> All right, sleep well.<br> You, too. All right, bye.<br> It's about time for your next contest.<br> Introducing first, in the red corner,<br> he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.<br> Please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore.<br> Say, "Uncle!"<br> Go, Mike. Go!<br> And his opponent in the blue corner,<br> he fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<br> Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon.<br> This bout is scheduled<br> for three, five-minute rounds,<br> and when the action begins,<br> your referee is Mr. Rick Fike.<br> Fighters to the center.<br> Come on, gentlemen.<br> I want you to obey my commands<br> at all times.<br> I want you to protect yourselves at all times.<br> If you have no questions,<br> touch gloves, back up.<br> And on my signal, let's come out fighting.<br> Fighter, are you ready?<br> Are you ready?<br> Do it!<br> Come on, Mike, let's go!<br> You gotta move with that one.<br> Come on, Mike!<br> Don't let him do that to you, Mike!<br> Get up, Mike, get up!<br> - First five minutes, out.<br> - Another 15? Great.<br> Hey! Hey, kid!<br> Nice fight.<br> Two more wins, you take home the bacon.<br> Hey, good job...<br> Hey, babe.<br> Hey.<br> How was work?<br> Oh, my God!<br> What happened?<br> You said it was gonna be a slow night.<br> I'm not bouncing at a club.<br> What do you mean you're not bouncing?<br> You've been lying to me?<br> I went in to apply<br> and they were paying nine bucks an hour.<br> Then I saw a sign for this other thing.<br> They're putting us out of the house<br> in three months.<br> We're running out of options.<br> Then they put us out of the house<br> in three months.<br> I'd rather go back to the old apartment<br> than see you in the back<br> of an ambulance again.<br> I thought we agreed<br> that we weren't gonna raise our children<br> in a family where their father<br> gets beat up for a living.<br> We're not giving up the house.<br> It's our home.<br> We're not going backwards.<br> We'll figure it out.<br> This is what we're not going back to.<br> You wanted to talk?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm gonna start fighting.<br> Is that right?<br> Don't play babe in the woods with me.<br> I know that guy from the gym<br> came to see you.<br> Colt Boyd.<br> Yeah. I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.<br> I wouldn't be sitting here<br> with you now if you did.<br> - Paddy, can I get you more coffee?<br> - No. Thank you.

Part of the reason...<br> Part of the reason I stuck around,<br> 'cause I thought I'd finally get you<br> all to myself.<br> But you didn't have any interest<br> in training me.<br> - You thought Tommy was the one.<br> - Brendan, I was a drunk.<br> I mean, you know, Brendan, I'm sorry.<br> Forget it.<br> You were always a frontrunner.<br> Never had any interest in the underdogs.<br> - But I was your son.<br> - You are my son, Brendan.<br> - Am I?<br> - Yeah, you are.<br> I'm just asking you if you can find...<br> Find a little bit of space in your heart<br> to forgive me a little bit.<br> Yeah?

J?<br> "Hearing the tremendous rush<br> of the sea-crashing boat,<br> "the whale wheeled round<br> to present his blank forehead at bay.<br> "The whale wheeled round<br> to present his blank forehead at bay.<br> "But in that evolution, catching sight<br> of the nearing black hull of the ship,<br> "seemingly seeing in it<br> the source of all his persecutions,<br> "bethinking it,<br> it may be a larger and nobler foe.<br> "Of a sudden,<br> he bore down upon its advancing prow,<br> "smiting his jaws<br> amid fiery showers of foam.<br> "Ahab staggered,<br> his hand smote his forehead.<br> "I grow blind..."<br> Now, the only person missing<br> from the event<br> was dark horse entry, Tommy Riordan.<br> Recent revelations that Riordan<br> was not only a United States Marine,<br> but a hero in the Iraq War,<br> has cast an even wider spotlight<br> on a fighter<br> who seems to have come out of nowhere.<br> Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's<br> Web testimony to Riordan,<br> who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq,<br> is now spreading like wildfire<br> throughout the media.<br> Tommy!<br> And the bridge just crumbled.<br> Tommy, come here.<br> Come on. You got to see this.<br> The amtrac was upside down<br> and water was coming in from everywhere.<br> And the water pressure was too much.<br> We couldn't get the back hatch open.<br> We were all drowning, man.<br> It was a death trap.<br> I couldn't have had more<br> than another minute.<br> Then suddenly,<br> the back ramp gets ripped off.<br> There he was.<br> And before I could get out and thank him,<br> he was gone.<br> - He just vanished like a ghost.<br> - Tommy?<br> - Tommy, did you... Where you going?<br> - Taking a walk.<br> Tommy!<br> I really just wanted to say thank you.<br> You saved my life, brother.<br> And anyone seeing this at Sparta,<br> anybody out in Pittsburgh,<br> you reach out to Tommy Riordan<br> and tell him Mark said, "Thank you."<br> Footage taken from a helmet cam<br> on the ground in Iraq<br> captured the heroic incident.<br> Hello?<br> Brendan?<br> Been looking all over for you.<br> How's it going?<br> It's going.<br> I was thinking we should go grab a coffee.<br> I don't drink coffee, man.<br> What do you want?<br> You don't wanna go sit down somewhere?<br> I'm good right here.<br> Okay.<br> Shit, Tommy, how was I supposed to know<br> I was never gonna see you guys again?<br> Yeah, well, you were briefed.<br> You had the information.<br> You chose the old man and the girl.<br> She wasn't just some girl.<br> I married her.<br> She's my wife.<br> See?<br> That's Tess.<br> That's Emily and Rosie.<br> They're your nieces, Tommy.<br> I don't know them.<br> I know you don't know them.<br> Of course you don't know them.<br> So why am I looking at pictures<br> of people I don't know?<br> 'Cause that's my family.<br> And who are you exactly?<br> I'm your brother, man.<br> You were in the Corps?<br> What?<br> - I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.<br> - I wasn't in the Corps.<br> Then you ain't no brother to me.<br> My brother was in the Corps.<br> Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.<br> I was a 16-year-old kid.<br> What the hell did I know?<br> I don't know what you know.<br> Why don't you go ask your girlfriend<br> about it?<br> She's my wife, Tommy.<br> So, that's it? I stay with Tess,<br> I never get to see you guys again?<br> Not a single phone call? Nothing?<br> God, man, I don't understand this.<br> What? You...<br> So, you won't forgive me,<br> but you forgave Pop?<br> No, he's just some old vet that I train with,<br> you know? He means nothing to me.<br> And what I hear,<br> he means nothing to you, either.<br> You got balls talking about forgiveness.<br> That has nothing to do with forgiveness.<br> I got children, man. I got a family to protect.<br> Everything I do is for them.<br> I forgave Pop.<br> Just like I forgave you and Mom.<br> You forgave us?<br> Yeah.<br> Well, I'm not surprised<br> you made the tournament, Brendan.<br> You got some stones, man.<br> I fell in love.<br> What the hell was I supposed to do?<br> You were supposed to stick to the plan.<br> You were supposed to come with us.<br> Mom needed you, I needed you.<br> You're my big brother. You bailed on me.<br> Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.<br> Everything worked out for you.<br> God.<br> You leave, you get the opposite. Okay?<br> You leave, you get to bury people.<br> You're not the only one<br> that suffered, Tommy.<br> I didn't even know she was sick.<br> I never even got the chance to say goodbye<br> to my own mother.<br> You had no right to keep that from me.<br> That was not your decision to make!<br> You know what?<br> You walk around<br> with your pictures of your wife,<br> and you're all, "I forgive you.<br> "I forgive Pop.<br> "I forgive everyone."<br> Brendan, you know,<br> you're full of shit.<br> Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?<br> You realize you're supposed to seek<br> my wise counsel<br> while school's actually in session, right?<br> - Yes, Principal Z.<br> - Tell him.<br> Okay, we wanna use the auditorium<br> this weekend<br> to watch Mr. C in Sparta.<br> What do you say?<br> So, you want to use the auditorium<br> to watch a suspended teacher engage<br> in the activity that he was suspended for?<br> - Right.<br> - Am I hearing this correct?<br> Right. Okay, we thought you would say that,<br> so it could turn into a fundraiser,<br> you know?<br> You know,<br> I think you need to talk to your parents,<br> because you guys might need<br> to be in summer school.<br> - Everybody wants this.<br> - Come on, Mr. Zito.<br> We've been telling everybody<br> about it already.<br> - Exactly.<br> - And the gym's the only place<br> - that's big enough to fit everyone.<br> - Look, it's never gonna happen.<br> - What if we get a petition signed?<br> - We'll get the whole school to sign it.<br> - The power of democracy.<br> - What are they gonna do about that?<br> Mr. Z, please?<br> Look, look, you guys. I appreciate the fact<br> that you love your teacher, I really do,<br> but there is nothing I can do for you.<br> The roof is about to blow clean off<br> Boardwalk Hall Arena.<br> It might be Fourth of July weekend,<br> but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.<br> This is Atlantic City.<br> This is the War on the Shore,<br> and this is<br> what everyone's been waiting for.<br> Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet<br> duking it out over a 24-hour period<br> for the largest purse<br> in mixed martial arts history.<br> In the town everyone knows<br> from the game of Monopoly,<br> we got ourselves a winner-take-all affair.<br> Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice,<br> and take a ride on the Reading.<br> Sparta is here!<br> Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,<br> along with bestselling fight author,<br> Sam Sheridan.<br> Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,<br> he wanted to create, quite simply,<br> the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle<br> in history.<br> $5 million, Bryan. $5 million.<br> J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is<br> and put up the biggest purse<br> the sport has ever seen.<br> It's unprecedented, Sam.<br> As is the hoopla surrounding<br> one Tommy Riordan, the war hero,<br> who has become an overnight sensation<br> and captured the imagination<br> and attention...<br> ...Jujitsu black belt Francisco Barbosa,<br> who has a 19 to four record<br> in his mixed martial arts' career.<br> Our rules of the cage are brought to you<br> by Tapout.<br> - Five minutes, Paddy.<br> - Okay.<br> It looks as though the moment of truth<br> has arrived,<br> - because here comes Tommy Riordan.<br> - Wow!<br> Tommy Riordan's<br> captured the media's attention,<br> but the question still remains.<br> Who is this guy?<br> And more importantly,<br> can he compete in this talent pool?<br> Can he win?<br> I wish I knew. I wish I knew who he was.<br> And I say the fact that I don't know<br> is very strange.<br> In an Internet age<br> where there are no secrets,<br> this guy's a complete mystery.<br> I can't find out anything about him.<br> Tommy Riordan is officially Google-proof.<br> Get your hands off me.<br> Okay, let's go.<br> You gotta love this guy, Sam.<br> No walk-out music,<br> no sponsors, no interviews.<br> He skipped the press conference,<br> wouldn't have his picture taken<br> for the program.<br> He's breaking every rule.<br> The only reason, really,<br> that Tommy Riordan is in this tournament<br> is an MMA video making the rounds of him<br> beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.<br> But the reason<br> that a lot of his fans are in the stands<br> is because of another video.<br> It's even more stunning<br> than the Mad Dog Grimes video.<br> This guy... Let me describe it to you, folks,<br> for the few that haven't seen it,<br> and I don't know anybody who hasn't,<br> but Tommy Riordan ripped the door<br> off a tank<br> in the heat of battle,<br> saving lives in the process,<br> and then walked away<br> without claiming a medal.<br> - Listen...<br> - He ripped the door off a tank.<br> Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero.<br> I'm not taking anything away from the guy,<br> he's a very, very tough guy,<br> - but the tank don't hit back, you know.<br> - Sam...<br> We've seen YouTube sensations fail<br> on a big stage before.<br> Sam, he ripped the door off a tank!<br> Tommy Riordan,<br> he has definitely got his hands full<br> in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa.<br> - Francisco Barbosa...<br> - He's nothing to scoff at.<br> Yeah, he's the octopus. He's the real deal.<br> He's a very, very tough guy,<br> a very high-caliber fighter.<br> Now, Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere,<br> and I'd imagine he's gonna disappear<br> just as quickly.<br> It's a great story,<br> but I think your boy<br> is gonna be exposed here<br> - as a YouTube sensation.<br> - Well, well,<br> a lot of fans here in Boardwalk Hall<br> hope you're wrong, Sam.<br> All right, gentlemen,<br> you've been given your instructions.<br> I expect a clean fight.<br> Obey my command at all times,<br> defend yourselves at all times.<br> Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.<br> Tommy, cut off the corners,<br> feel this guy out,<br> just like we know. Just like we know.<br> We're about to get the big answer<br> to the big question.<br> Is Tommy Riordan for real?<br> - Gentlemen, you ready?<br> - They are both game fighters.<br> - And here we go.<br> - You ready?<br> Let's go to war!<br> Keep your focus, Tom.<br> And here we go. We're gonna see this.<br> Barbosa's gonna be looking for a takedown.<br> He's definitely looking for a takedown here.<br> Barbosa is down!<br> Barbosa has been knocked out!<br> Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real.<br> And now he's walking out of the cage.<br> He's leaving the cage.<br> Hey, Tommy!<br> There goes another rule, out the window!<br> Where you going?<br> Francisco Barbosa is out cold,<br> and he is out of this tournament, Bryan.<br> - A huge left hook, launching...<br> - Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.<br> ...Tommy Riordan into the second round.<br> - One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.<br> Good. Two, three.<br> Good. Good, good, good.<br> - Good. Come on. Good. One, two.<br> - Tommy Riordan is the real deal.<br> - Showtime.<br> - All right. Come on, give me eight.<br> Yes! That's my boy.<br> Let's go, move your head around.<br> You ready?<br> Look at me.<br> You can do this.<br> I wanna hear you say it.<br> I can do this.<br> Let's go do this.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> J.J. Riley only had 48 hours,<br> less than 48 hours, to fill the spot.<br> And basically, he had to go on the road<br> to Frank Campana.<br> Well, then he chose Brendan Conlon,<br> which is really something<br> I don't understand.<br> I just... I'm shocked.<br> Hey, Brendan. Brendan, go get him.<br> Go. Good luck.<br> Let's go, Brendan.<br> You go get him, Son!<br> You know, I can understand<br> coming out to no music,<br> but why in the world would you choose<br> classical music as your entrance?<br> This is Beethoven.<br> This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.<br> My apologies, Mr. Renaissance Man.<br> Go get him, Son.<br> If you wanna talk about Renaissance men,<br> you gotta talk about Frank Campana.<br> Very unorthodox trainer,<br> but one of the best trainers in the game,<br> and he's well known for using classical<br> music to teach his fighters to remain calm,<br> to remain patient,<br> and to remain composed under pressure.<br> You know, I'll tell you, classical music<br> is about as fitting to this setting<br> as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.<br> - Come on.<br> - In fact, let me show you something.<br> Right here. Let me tell you...<br> - What?<br> - You see that, right there?<br> That, right there...<br> That, my friend, is Brendan Conlon.<br> Okay? Brendan Conlon's about<br> to be dropped into a shark tank.<br> He's a feeder fish.<br> Come on, give the guy a break.<br> You know, the guy...<br> At least we've seen him fight.<br> I mean, he's fought real guys.<br> He's been in the UFC.<br> - We remember him from that.<br> - I remember him, too.<br> I remember him being very unmemorable.<br> Midnight Le getting ready<br> to climb into the cage and go to work.<br> When the brackets were announced,<br> he thought he'd be going up<br> against Marco Santos.<br> He's got to be thrilled to be seeing<br> Brendan Conlon across from him.<br> Hey! You asked for it.<br> Brendan retired from fighting<br> some years ago.<br> He's actually<br> a high school physics teacher now,<br> and Midnight had some fun with that<br> at the press conference yesterday.<br> Well, he said he was going to give<br> the teacher a serious lesson,<br> and that getting killed was no way<br> to spend a summer vacation.<br> Midnight is known for talking trash,<br> he's also known for backing it up.<br> No question, Bryan.<br> He's in a lot of trouble here.<br> - Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.<br> - Gentlemen.<br> Go get him.<br> All right, guys,<br> you've been given your instructions.<br> I expect a clean fight.<br> Obey my commands at all times.<br> Defend yourselves at all times.<br> Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.<br> Go have some fun, baby.<br> Gentlemen, you ready?<br> You ready? Let's go to war!<br> Work your kicks!<br> Work your kicks!<br> Come on, Brendan, come on.<br> Move! You gotta move, you gotta move.<br> Let it out! Come on, move!<br> Stay away from the legs! Circle!<br> In and out!<br> Get off the fence!<br> Get through this. Sprawl down!<br> Get off the fence! Get off the fence!<br> There he goes!<br> Come on, Brendan. Get out of there!<br> Come on!<br> Get up!<br> - Come on! Come on!<br> - Watch the back of the head!<br> - Relax, you're okay. You're okay!<br> - Midnight is all over Brendan.<br> Well, this can't last much longer.<br> This won't last much longer.<br> The teacher just has no answers.<br> Get out of there! Get out of there!<br> - And now, he's got the hooks in.<br> - The hooks are in.<br> - Brendan in very big trouble.<br> - The end is close.<br> Can Brendan make the end of the round?<br> Well, he's got the choke.<br> - He's got 20 seconds left in the round...<br> - Come on.<br> ...and Conlon's face is turning purple.<br> This looks like it's over.<br> Get up! Find his legs!<br> Hips! Hip down!<br> Hip down! Get your weight down!<br> Get your weight down!<br> Well, Midnight is squeezing<br> with all his might. He's got it very deep.<br> - Ten seconds! Don't you tap!<br> - Ten seconds, Bryan, 10 seconds.<br> Don't tap! Brendan, don't you tap!<br> Hold on, Brendan.<br> Conlon doing his best to hang on,<br> 'cause his whole world's about to go<br> from day to night.<br> Don't you tap! Don't you tap, Brendan!<br> I cannot believe that, Sam!<br> I thought for sure this guy<br> was going to sleep.<br> Midnight can't believe it either, by the way.<br> Jesus.<br> What are you doing? What are you doing?<br> You should've had him in the first round.<br> You should've had him in the first round.<br> Beautiful. Beautiful.<br> He doesn't know what hit him.<br> He doesn't know what hit him. Breathe.<br> Deep breaths. Come on now.<br> Small sip, small sip. Small sip.<br> Deep breath, deep breath.<br> I want you to do something.<br> I want you to get him to pull, okay?<br> When he pulls, I want you to hit him a bit<br> and I want you to shoot on him.<br> I'd love to be a fly on the wall,<br> listening to Frank Campana right now<br> and hear what he's saying in there.<br> In and out. In and out. In and out.<br> And I want you to trade punches<br> with him, all right? You're doing beautiful.<br> Let's go, seconds out!<br> Knock him out. Knock him out.<br> Knock him out.<br> This round, knock him out.<br> - Let's do it.<br> - He doesn't deserve to be here.<br> Beautiful. Breathe.<br> Let's go!<br> And here we go. The teacher<br> answering the bell for round two.<br> Nice and easy!<br> Set the pace! Set the pace, Brendan!<br> Gentlemen! Let's go to war!<br> Circle around! Circle around!<br> Nice and easy!<br> Good, good!<br> Shoot! Shoot on him!<br> Get out of there! Hitch him! Hitch him!<br> Hitch him!<br> Get out of there!<br> Get out of there! Get out of there! Come on!<br> Do something.<br> Shoot! Shoot on him!<br> Shoot on him!<br> Yes!<br> Conlon shoots on Midnight Le<br> and gets him down.<br> Midnight is trying to get to his...<br> - Scissors takedown.<br> - A beautiful scissors takedown.<br> - Really nice.<br> - Conlon showing signs of life<br> and not backing down.<br> Knees, knees!<br> Good!<br> Take his arm! Good!<br> - He's got a kimura lock!<br> - He's got a very good kimura.<br> Turn your hips in! In!<br> Up! Stay with him. Turn your hips in!<br> Hips up! Turn your hips in!<br> Turn your hips in!<br> You got it, Brendan. Your round. You got it!<br> Turn your hips up and in!<br> Hips up! Very good!<br> He's in a lot of trouble.<br> That's it! Come on! Come on!<br> - Wow! He's got it very, very deep.<br> - Midnight is in a very, very bad position.<br> Midnight is in big trouble.<br> Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!<br> Brendan Conlon is going<br> to finish it right here!<br> Brendan Conlon has got<br> him in a very, very dangerous position<br> - and Midnight is in big trouble.<br> - Midnight...<br> I don't think Midnight has anywhere to go.<br> You got it! You got it!<br> Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!<br> And this isn't... This isn't happening!<br> - This can't happen.<br> - It just did, Bryan.<br> He tapped!<br> Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!<br> - I can't believe that.<br> - Oh, my goodness!<br> You got him! Way to go, Brendan!<br> Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.<br> Honey, he tapped him out!<br> He did it! He did it! He did it! He did it!<br> Way to go, Brendan! Way to go! Yeah!<br> This is what's so great<br> about mixed martial arts.<br> There's so many ways to lose.<br> One tiny miscalculation,<br> anyone can win at anytime.<br> Which is probably why Frank Campana's<br> embracing his man.<br> And I honestly don't think either<br> one of them can believe what just happened.<br> Great show of sportsmanship here<br> from the teacher.<br> Well, that's a hallmark<br> of Frank Campana's philosophy,<br> something all his fighters buy into,<br> and, obviously, none more so than Brendan.<br> And Midnight Le is shocked.<br> He thought he'd get a free pass<br> into the second round,<br> but, instead, he's going home.<br> Dominated the fight the entire way,<br> but he falls prey to a very technical finish.<br> A very technical finish, but that's a fluke.<br> - I don't care what anybody says. That is a...<br> - I don't know.<br> You can call it a fluke, but I'm gonna call it<br> a guy maintaining composure<br> and waiting for his opportunity.<br> Conlon beats Midnight! Unbelievable!<br> I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.<br> Yes!<br> Okay.<br> We're down to eight fighters,<br> and soon to be seven,<br> as Koba prepares to go to work<br> for the second time tonight.<br> - Right hand.<br> - Huge right hand.<br> - Huge right hand.<br> - Oh, my goodness.<br> Oh, my God! This is over.<br> Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.<br> You got to be kidding me. I'm afraid<br> he might have broken something else.<br> That's certainly possible.<br> Koba moving on to tomorrow night.<br> - Koba! Koba!<br> - Koba! Koba!<br> Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed.<br> Like a man with something to prove,<br> reminding everyone why he is a<br> serious contender to win this whole contest.<br> He wanted to send a message to<br> Tommy Riordan, and there it is, right there.<br> Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.<br> The teacher miraculously<br> passed his first test,<br> but now he's got to face The Dane.<br> Brendan! You can do it.<br> Halfway through round three, now,<br> and the beating continues.<br> I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon<br> can take this kind of punishment.<br> He has been battered without mercy<br> - in both of his fights today.<br> - Relax! You're okay!<br> He's still standing, Bryan.<br> Beethoven!<br> No! No, no, no!<br> Good, take him down!<br> Look at this, he's taking The Dane down!<br> Hold on to him.<br> He's looking for that arm.<br> He's looking for the armbar.<br> - He's got an armbar.<br> - He's got that armbar.<br> He's looking to be boss of it, once again.<br> Tap, tap, tap! Come on, tap, tap, tap!<br> Palms flat! Palms flat! Thumbs up!<br> He's got that arm, Sam!<br> - Break, break, break, break!<br> - Yes!<br> Are you kidding me?<br> Yes!<br> Do it once, it's a fluke.<br> Do it twice, and it's something else.<br> Pull the bandwagon over,<br> I think I am hopping on.<br> I think I'm a believer.<br> You did it! Way to go, Brendan!<br> - I'm doing this!<br> - Okay.<br> - I'm doing it!<br> - Okay.<br> Okay, Son.<br> The crowd catching fire<br> for the hero Tommy Riordan.<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> He doesn't seem to want<br> anything to do with all this adulation.<br> He's just here to fight.<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> Gentlemen, you ready?<br> Are you ready?<br> - Let's go to war!<br> - Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!<br> Well, here he comes again like a buzz saw!<br> - Yeah.<br> - He is all over Diego Santana.<br> He's swarming all over him,<br> and now he's beating on him without mercy!<br> Oh, my goodness!<br> There he goes again,<br> storming out of the cage!<br> Tommy Riordan marching off<br> through the crowd<br> and straight into the final four,<br> ladies and gentlemen.<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> - So where is he?<br> - Yeah. Mr. Conlon.<br> Make a right at that white sign...<br> Hey! Can't sleep, huh?<br> I know that that other thing is<br> bothering the hell out of you.<br> I'm proud of you, Tommy.<br> What you did for that kid in the tank,<br> that was really something.<br> How about deserting my unit?<br> Is that really something, too?<br> Yeah.<br> I was on my way out of the country<br> when I came across those guys.<br> What was I supposed to do?<br> Let them drown?<br> No.<br> - What did you do?<br> - What did I do?<br> I took off.<br> That's why you go by Riordan.<br> That's why they can't<br> find your service records.<br> What the hell happened over there, Tommy?<br> That is none of your business, man.<br> Come on, kiddo. You know, I've been there.<br> I've done it, I've seen it.<br> You can trust me. I understand.<br> Will you spare me the<br> compassionate father routine, Pop?<br> The suit don't fit.<br> Tommy.<br> I'm really trying here.<br> - You're trying?<br> - Yeah, really. I'm trying.<br> Now?<br> Where were you when it mattered?<br> I needed this guy back when I was a kid.<br> I don't need you now.<br> You know, it's too late now.<br> Everything's already happened.<br> You and Brendan<br> don't seem to understand that.<br> Let me explain something to you, okay?<br> The only thing that I have in common<br> with Brendan Conlon<br> is that the pair of us,<br> we have absolutely no use for you.<br> Look at you.<br> Yeah, I was right.<br> I think I liked you better<br> when you were a drunk.<br> At least you had some balls then,<br> not like now,<br> tiptoeing around,<br> like some beggar with your cup out.<br> Take it somewhere else.<br> In fact, you know what?<br> Here's a cup.<br> Why don't you take this and go get yourself<br> some more of your shitty tapes...<br> - Don't do this, Tommy.<br> ...and you go back to the room<br> - and you listen to some more...<br> - Don't do this.<br> ...fish stories that no one gives a shit about.<br> Now get out of here.<br> Get the fuck out of here! Go on.<br> God pity them!<br> All shall perish except me!<br> Bastards. Bastards!<br> You bastards. You bastards!<br> Stop the ship, you bastards!<br> Ishmael. God pity them.<br> Stop the ship. Please, stop the ship.<br> Stop the ship! Somebody.<br> Ahab.<br> You godless son of a bitch!<br> You stop the ship!<br> You godless son of a bitch!<br> "The whale! The ship! '<br> Cried the cringing oarsmen.<br> "Oars! Oars! Slope downward..."<br> Stop it.<br> "O sea that ere it be for ever too late,<br> "Ahab may slide this last,<br> last time upon his mark!"<br> Captain...<br> Stop the...<br> Captain, stop...<br> Stop the ship, Ahab.<br> For the love of God.<br> They're lost.<br> Stop it... The ship.<br> Ahab...<br> You stop the...<br> Oh, no.<br> - Come on, give me the Walkman.<br> - No.<br> - No, no.<br> - Come on.<br> Come on, come on.<br> Come, give me the bottle.<br> Come here, come here, come here.<br> - Come on. Give me.<br> - No.<br> Tommy.<br> We're lost.<br> We're lost, Tommy.<br> It's over. We'll never make it back.<br> - Stay down.<br> - We'll never make it back.<br> I'm here.<br> I always loved you.<br> You know that, don't you, Tommy?<br> I always loved you.<br> You and your brother. My two boys.<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> Tommy Riordan coming down the tunnel<br> without his trainer.<br> Once again, no walk-out music.<br> I'd hardly say no music, Sam.<br> Bryan, it sounds like V-J day<br> in Times Square.<br> I've never seen anything like this.<br> Tommy acknowledging his comrades<br> for the first time<br> and climbing into the cage.<br> Mad Dog Grimes has been<br> waiting for revenge<br> ever since the day Tommy Riordan<br> walked into his gym in Pittsburgh<br> and turned his life upside down.<br> It's been a very long and very miserable<br> few months for Mad Dog, to say the least.<br> Grimes mocking Riordan by having<br> a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,<br> and the Marines are really<br> letting Mad Dog have it.<br> All right, gentlemen.<br> All right, gentlemen,<br> we've been over your instructions.<br> I expect a clean fight.<br> Obey my commands at all times,<br> defend yourselves at all times.<br> Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.<br> It's not gonna happen again.<br> Mad Dog chomping at the bit here.<br> He can't wait to get a piece of Tommy.<br> He predicted an early knockout.<br> He said he was gonna<br> take Tommy out with one punch.<br> And by the way, he said,<br> "They're gonna have to pull me off him."<br> We'll see what Tommy has to say about that.<br> Gentlemen, you ready?<br> You ready?<br> - Let's go to war!<br> - Here they go and they are off!<br> Tommy tackles him, and he's on top!<br> He's raining bombs!<br> - Cover up!<br> - Come on, work it.<br> - Raining bombs.<br> - Mad Dog is out.<br> Mad Dog's in trouble. Please stop this.<br> Stop it! Stop the fight!<br> Break! Break! Break!<br> That's the fastest knockout I think<br> I've ever experienced!<br> Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.<br> He is not moving.<br> You do that to someone on the street,<br> they lock you up and throw away the key.<br> Break out the yellow tape, Sam.<br> This guy's walking away from the cage<br> like he's leaving a crime scene!<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> - Tommy! Tommy!<br> - Everybody through. Come on, move it out.<br> - Sparta!<br> Yeah!<br> Mr. C! Mr. C!<br> I'm on your side.<br> Let's go.<br> - Principal Zito, there he is.<br> - Nice.<br> Let's go, Brendan.<br> Brendan Conlon came into this tournament<br> as 1,000-to-one underdog,<br> and now here he is in the final four.<br> The crowd showing their appreciation.<br> He's getting quite the reception.<br> He's got a huge reception.<br> I mean, this guy shocked everybody.<br> Come on, come on. You all right?<br> You've got a visitor.<br> Second row, 10 o'clock.<br> You all right with that?<br> I love you.<br> And here comes the great Russian, Koba.<br> Koba is so intimidating<br> and his reputation is larger than life.<br> - Koba! Koba!<br> - Koba! Koba!<br> I want you to look right at him<br> when he comes in here. Look right at him.<br> All right? Don't take your eyes off him.<br> I'm proud of you, brother.<br> This is your cage.<br> Gentlemen.<br> All right, gentlemen,<br> we've been over your instructions.<br> I expect a clean fight.<br> Obey my commands at all times,<br> defend yourselves at all times.<br> Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.<br> Should I be nervous for Brendan?<br> 'Cause I am.<br> I wanna stop the fight<br> before it even gets going.<br> - Well, here we go.<br> - He's like a machine. Look at him.<br> Gentlemen, you ready?<br> You ready? Let's go to war!<br> Keep your hands up, Brendan. Hands up.<br> But now, the question is, how long<br> can Brendan Conlon stay alive?<br> Angle out of it!<br> Keep moving!<br> Get out of there! Get out of there!<br> Keep moving! Keep moving!<br> Get away from him!<br> Hit him, babe! Hit him! Get in there!<br> - Crushing body shots.<br> - Relax, you're okay.<br> Conlon's down,<br> and Koba pounces and starts pounding!<br> Get up! Get up!<br> He's just pounding on him<br> like a side of beef.<br> Go, go, go. Get up!<br> He's getting his ass whooped.<br> And now he's got him in the air!<br> Oh, God.<br> Relax, tie up his arm! Tie him up!<br> I think Campana has to think<br> seriously about...<br> - How much abuse can one man take?<br> ...continuing another round of this.<br> Go to war!<br> Just relax! Relax! Relax! Off the fence!<br> Brendan's going for a ride!<br> That one shook the entire building!<br> Man, he just threw him against the fence<br> like a rag doll.<br> Get up! Get up! Come on!<br> Hold on! Turn it in! Turn in!<br> And now he's on top! Koba's on top,<br> and he's finishing him, here. Look at this.<br> On the edge of blowing it.<br> Get off the fence, Brendan!<br> You wonder how Conlon can<br> take this kind of beating on his arms.<br> - His forearms and his hands.<br> - Drop that neck!<br> How much can one man take?<br> Break! Break! Break!<br> Everybody has got to be<br> a little bit concerned<br> about Brendan Conlon's bravery<br> getting him in trouble here.<br> His bravery could get him killed, frankly.<br> And by the way,<br> he's got nothing more to prove.<br> - He's lasted two rounds with Koba.<br> - That's true, that's true.<br> And you wonder what's keeping this guy up.<br> Sit down. Sit down.<br> Breathe. Breathe!<br> Look at me. Look at me!<br> Wait up. Small sips. Hold it.<br> Hold it, small sips.<br> Why are we here?<br> Why are we here, Brendan?<br> Why are we here?<br> Are we here to win this fight?<br> Are we here to win this fight?<br> You tell me.<br> 'Cause if we're not, I will throw in the towel.<br> We will get Tess and we will go home.<br> We'll go home, okay?<br> You don't knock him out, you lose the fight.<br> Do you understand me?<br> You don't knock him out,<br> you don't have a home.<br> Let's go! Seconds out! Seconds out!<br> Gentlemen! Let's go to war!<br> Conlon somehow<br> answering the call to round three.<br> And Koba's all over him once again.<br> Brendan's giving back, Bryan.<br> I mean, there's signs of life<br> in Brendan Conlon.<br> He's starting to mix it up.<br> Pummel, pummel, pummel.<br> He's taking Koba down,<br> but the Russian's back up.<br> Brendan shoots him again,<br> pressing him against the cage.<br> - Yes!<br> - Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.<br> Well, Conlon trapped in an iron vice here,<br> and Koba now squeezing his neck<br> for all it's worth,<br> trying to choke the teacher out.<br> Hips, hips, hips! Breathe! Breathe!<br> Ride it out! Ride it out!<br> Conlon looking for a way out.<br> - What is this?<br> - Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?<br> He just shook off a guillotine<br> and tossed Koba.<br> Conlon's looking for an armbar.<br> He's looking for that armbar,<br> - and he's trying to submit the Russian bear.<br> - Hips, hips, hips!<br> Yeah, you got him!<br> You got him! You got him!<br> Koba slips right out.<br> Conlon's staying after him.<br> He's squeezing the bear.<br> The tables have turned and the boy scout<br> is actually messing with the bear.<br> The teacher springing off the fence and<br> going for a mountain,<br> - but Koba's on his feet.<br> - Get up, get up!<br> He does not want to be<br> on the ground with Brendan<br> and his endless bag of submissions.<br> Koba trying to reestablish his dominance<br> with brutal shots to the face.<br> But Conlon's showing no fear.<br> This is a fight!<br> We have got ourselves a fight!<br> Wow, that's a huge elbow to the head.<br> And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar.<br> He's got it very deep!<br> He's got it very, very deep!<br> He's deep on that.<br> He's got Koba in a lot of pain.<br> We saw this with Midnight,<br> we saw it against The Dane,<br> and we're seeing it here! Brendan Conlon...<br> Break it! Break it! Break it!<br> Not letting out!<br> Conlon wrenching that knee<br> for all it's worth.<br> He's putting everything he has into it.<br> And Koba is screaming in pain.<br> Koba taps.<br> Koba has tapped!<br> Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!<br> I can't believe it!<br> Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!<br> He's tapped Koba!<br> And Frank Campana can't believe it.<br> This whole place can't believe it.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba.<br> - Tess!<br> - You got it! You did it!<br> Brendan taps the world Sambo<br> champ with a knee bar!<br> - Babe, you did it!<br> - Brendan Conlon!<br> - I don't know what to say. It's amazing!<br> - I don't know what I just saw.<br> I just don't know<br> how to put this into context.<br> That's gotta be the biggest upset<br> in MMA history.<br> I have never seen anything like this.<br> He tapped a world Sambo champion<br> in a knee bar!<br> Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba!<br> Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!<br> Brendan Conlon, the civilian!<br> He's done the impossible.<br> He has done the impossible.<br> He's pulled off a miracle.<br> This place is going crazy<br> because they've just seen a miracle.<br> This is CNN Breaking News.<br> A surprising turn in the story<br> of Iraq War hero, Tommy Riordan.<br> CNN has learned that Riordan's true identity<br> is that of Marine Staff Sergeant<br> Thomas Conlon,<br> who went AWOL from his unit<br> earlier this year,<br> following the friendly fire death<br> of his brother-in-arms,<br> Sergeant Manny Fernandez.<br> Fernandez's wife, Pilar Fernandez,<br> spoke with me<br> in an exclusive interview, moments ago.<br> The bombs started dropping.<br> They were coming from US planes.<br> Tommy and Manny were waving their flags<br> to let them know they were Americans,<br> but they didn't stop.<br> Everyone died.<br> Everyone except Tommy.<br> And, you know, my Manny used to say,<br> that Tommy was the brother he never had.<br> Conlon, who is fighting in the mixed<br> martial arts mega tournament, Sparta,<br> is expected to be taken into custody<br> by military police,<br> following tonight's winner-take-all finale<br> in Atlantic City.<br> If victorious, he has pledged<br> his $5 million purse<br> to the widow of his fallen comrade.<br> We've just got some incredible news,<br> that I'm having trouble<br> putting into context, but here it is.<br> The two men<br> fighting for the championship tonight,<br> for the $5 million prize,<br> for the middleweight championship<br> of the world,<br> are brothers.<br> All right, let's get this off.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> I'm gonna fight him.<br> - Mr. C, Mr. C!<br> - Mr. C, Mr. C!<br> - Tommy!
