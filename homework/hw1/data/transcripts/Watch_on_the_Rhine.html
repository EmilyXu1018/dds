                        So the moment has come.<br> This time, it is of the utmost importance.<br> Please do not talk.<br> Please do not seem nervous.<br> [SPEAKING IN GERMAN]<br> Papa told you it is good manners to speak<br> the language of the country you visit.<br> Therefore, speak in English.<br> I said, whenever we have<br> crossed a border...<br> ...I so fix my feet<br> from one country to the other.<br> I have found it to be of good luck.<br> - And so I advise all of you...<br> - Yes.<br> You are one of the many people<br> who are so pleased with what they say...<br> ...that the 10th time they have said it,<br> it is as fresh to them as the first.<br> Spare us.<br> - I can't believe it, darling.<br> - I give you orders to believe it.<br> And now you are in your own land, Sara.<br> And that is good.<br> Your face is most happy, Sara.<br> And most pretty.<br> [TRAIN WHISTLE BLoWING]<br> Are you comfortable?<br> Oh, yes, Mama. This is most luxurious.<br> I am surprised.<br> The United States of America...<br> ...is a sun-lighted, dusty country<br> with vegetation of no great height and...<br> You are ready to write a book about it?<br> SARA:<br> This part of it is, Bodo.<br> But this part of the country<br> is strange to me too.<br> Perhaps all of it will be strange to me.<br> It's been 17 years.<br> Carterville, next stop. Carterville.<br> There are, I think, others here<br> who are not Americans.<br> You do not know that people from<br> the utmost different parts of the world...<br> ...have found refuge<br> in the United States of America?<br> We know that.<br> [WHISPERING]<br> I did not imagine houses in America...<br> ...to be as those I have<br> seen from this train.<br> Do you think the house<br> of Mama's mother is one such?<br> [WHISPERING]<br> I do not know.<br> Is it that you have been<br> accustomed to palaces?<br> I do not complain. I only ask.<br> I live where Mama and Papa take us.<br> But it is only natural<br> I have curiosity for our relatives.<br> Joseph.<br> - Morning.<br> - Good morning, madame.<br> - Everybody down?<br> - No. Nobody down. I'll get your tea.<br> Breakfast is at 9:00 in this house,<br> and will be until the day after I die.<br> - Ring the bell.<br> - But it ain't 9:00 yet, Miss Fanny. It's 8:30.<br> Well, put the clocks up to 9<br> and ring the bell.<br> JoSEPH:<br> Mr. David told me not to ring it anymore.<br> He say it got too mean a ring, that bell.<br> It disturbs folks.<br> That's what it was put there for.<br> I like to disturb folks.<br> Yes'm.<br> I couldn't sleep.<br> I kept thinking of Sara coming home.<br> But you slept well, Anise. You were asleep<br> before I could dismantle myself.<br> I woke several times during the night.<br> Did you?<br> Then you were careful not to stop snoring.<br> Now that Sara and her family are coming,<br> we must get around to moving your room.<br> Jenny's daughter<br> is still going with that actor.<br> An actor. Fashions in sin change.<br> In my day, it was Englishmen.<br> Oh, my mail looks dull.<br> Anything in anybody else's mail?<br> The usual advertisements for Mr. David.<br> For the Count and Countess de Brancovis...<br> ...nothing but what seems to be an<br> invitation to a lower-class embassy tea.<br> And some letters<br> asking for bills to get paid.<br> That's every morning. In the weeks Marthe<br> and her husband have been visiting us...<br> ...they seem to have run up many bills.<br> Yes, I told you that.<br> Why do you suppose anybody would give<br> charge accounts to Romanian nobility?<br> Perhaps because they are the guests<br> of Madame Joshua Farrelly.<br> Perhaps.<br> How does David's flirtation<br> with Marthe get on? Anything happen?<br> Happen? I don't know what you mean.<br> You know very well what I mean.<br> Oh, that. Oh, no. I don't think that.<br> I must...<br> - Joseph.<br> - Yes'm.<br> [BELL CLANGING]<br> Little birds, I don't blame you.<br> Joseph, stop that.<br> It ain't me, Mr. David. I don't like any noise.<br> Miss Fanny told me.<br> - She didn't tell you to hang yourself.<br> JoSEPH: I ain't hung.<br> MARTHE: Good morning, David.<br> - Good morning, Marthe.<br> I'm going to have a chicken house<br> fixed up as a playroom for my mother.<br> I will hang it with bells and she can go into<br> her second childhood in the proper privacy.<br> [CHUCKLES]<br> She'll only make us have breakfast there.<br> FANNY:<br> David. Come to breakfast.<br> Shall we go down together?<br> Couldn't you ask your admirer<br> if it would be possible...<br> ...to have a breakfast a little later<br> than 9:00?<br> I don't mind that<br> as much as having to eat it on the terrace.<br> Any morning<br> it's not positively snowing.<br> Anything Madame Fanny's<br> long-dead husband did...<br> ...she thinks God intended<br> everybody else to do.<br> It's unfortunate that early American liberals<br> were such a hardy people.<br> Breakfast promptly at 9, outdoors.<br> Dinner promptly at 8.<br> I won't be in tonight to dinner.<br> Does that please you?<br> - You might have it with David.<br> - I might.<br> With whom are you dining?<br> Oh, you will not bump into me.<br> I'll be at the German Embassy.<br> Teck, I've asked you...<br> You slept well.<br> It doesn't seem to matter to you...<br> ...that your sister whom you haven't seen<br> is coming home.<br> But they aren't coming today, Mama.<br> I lay awake most of the night<br> thinking of Sara and of your father.<br> Wondering what<br> he would have thought...<br> ...coming home<br> with her husband and children.<br> Three grandchildren.<br> He'd have liked that.<br> - I hope I shall.<br> - You will.<br> Anything in my mail, Anise?<br> - Advertisements only.<br> - Thanks.<br> You and Mama save me<br> a lot of time reading.<br> I cannot speak for Madame Fanny,<br> but I have never opened a letter in my life.<br> You don't have to.<br> For you, they fly open.<br> It's true. You're a snooper, Anise.<br> It shows an interest in life.<br> - Bonjour, Mademoiselle Anise.<br> ANISE: Bonjour, madame.<br> Oh, there you are. Don't people<br> ever get out of bed in Romania?<br> - Good morning.<br> - Not if they can help it. But, my apologies.<br> [BELL RINGS]<br> JoSEPH:<br> Here I am, Miss Fanny.<br> Has science a name<br> for women who enjoy noise?<br> Fanny's excited.<br> You're excited too.<br> A few more days<br> and your Sara will be home.<br> I am excited. And I'm afraid too.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't know. It's been so many years.<br> - Afraid she won't like me anymore, I guess.<br> - Oh, but she will.<br> Of course.<br> I remember Sara.<br> Mama brought me one day<br> when your father was stationed in Paris.<br> I was about 6 and Sara was about 15,<br> and you were...<br> You were a pretty little girl.<br> Do you really remember me?<br> You never told me.<br> - I wanted you to remember me, but l...<br> FANNY: Well.<br> Monsieur Chabeuf the upholsterer says,<br> not a pincushion...<br> ...not even so much as,<br> could he reupholster in two days.<br> In the matter of four chairs,<br> a chaise longue, and two...<br> oh, nonsense.<br> Your Monsieur Chabeuf is lazy.<br> Is he on the phone?<br> - Everybody's lazy. Except me.<br> - Indeed.<br> Madame Fanny has energy.<br> I find it most attractive.<br> Perhaps because you're not related to it.<br> But it works wonders.<br> What sort of man<br> is the husband of your sister?<br> I've never met him.<br> My mother did once, in Munich.<br> The day Sara met him, I think.<br> I remember Mama telling me about it.<br> It was rather a scandal, wasn't it?<br> The Farrelly daughter marrying a German<br> who was poor and unknown.<br> Oh, Mama wouldn't have minded that.<br> If only they'd come home and allowed her<br> to arrange their lives for them.<br> But Sara didn't want it that way<br> and that made Mama angry.<br> But all was forgiven a long time ago.<br> And now that they are coming home...<br> They're fortunate to be able<br> to get out of Germany.<br> Oh, they've been out of Germany<br> since the early '30s.<br> Oh?<br> - Where have they been living?<br> - They've moved around a great deal since.<br> Sara's letters<br> come from all kinds of places...<br> ...Switzerland, Czechoslovakia,<br> Denmark, France.<br> Kurt is an engineer. But I'm not sure...<br> Well, you'll have a house<br> full of refugees soon. Us and the...<br> Are you a refugee?<br> I'm not sure I know<br> what you're a refugee from.<br> From Europe.<br> From what Europe?<br> - Just Europe.<br> FANNY: David. David!<br> This is one of Mama's screaming days.<br> I'm going to the office before she finds<br> any more errands for me to do.<br> I've got to ask Penfield<br> about the best school for 12-year-old girls.<br> Ask Walton about a school for boys.<br> Buy boys' books, buy girl's books,<br> buy bicycles...<br> ...three puppies...<br> From what Europe?<br> I'm not sure<br> what we're refugees from either.<br> Aren't you?<br> A great many mistaken people seem to have<br> given you a great many charge accounts.<br> It'd be nice<br> to be able to pay bills again.<br> Do not act as though<br> I refuse to pay them.<br> I did not sleep well last night.<br> I was worried.<br> We have $85<br> in American Express checks.<br> - That is all we have, Marthe.<br> - Maybe something will turn up. It's due.<br> David?<br> - Money does not worry you?<br> - It worries me very much.<br> But I just lie still now and hope.<br> I'm glad to be here.<br> We've come to the end of a road.<br> It's been true for a long time.<br> Things will have to go<br> one way or the other.<br> Maybe they'll go well for a change.<br> I have not come<br> to the end of any road.<br> No? I admire you.<br> Perhaps because you think the road<br> will lead you back to Europe again?<br> You can't give up that dream,<br> can you, Teck?<br> That you can get back<br> into their good graces again?<br> That they'll let you come back and play?<br> You ought to stay away from them.<br> - You have political convictions?<br> - I don't know what I have.<br> But I've never liked Nazis<br> and you should have had enough of them.<br> They seem to have had enough of you.<br> They're smarter than you are<br> and it's time you let them alone.<br> I think you're trying<br> to say something to me.<br> What is it?<br> That you ought not to be seen<br> at the German Embassy.<br> And that it's insane to go on<br> playing poker there with only $85 left.<br> Suppose you lose this time? I don't think<br> they'd like your not being able to pay up.<br> - I shall try not to lose.<br> - But suppose you do and you can't pay?<br> Everyone in Washington<br> will know it in an hour.<br> And we'll be out of here.<br> I think I want to be out of here.<br> I find that I do not like<br> the picture of you and our host.<br> There's no picture, as you put it,<br> to like or dislike.<br> Not yet, eh?<br> I am glad to hear that.<br> Marthe, you understand<br> that I'm not really a fool?<br> You understand it's unwise<br> to calculate me that way?<br> Yes, I understand that.<br> And I understand that I'm getting tired,<br> just plain tired.<br> The whole thing is too much for me.<br> I've always wanted to ask you,<br> since you play on so many sides...<br> ...why we don't come out any better.<br> I've always wanted to ask you<br> how it happened.<br> I'm tired, see?<br> And I just want to sit down.<br> Just sit down in a chair and stay.<br> You have thus arranged it, with David?<br> I have arranged nothing.<br> But you are trying, eh?<br> I think not.<br> I would not like that.<br> I would not like that at all.<br> [TRAIN WHISTLE BLoWING]<br> BoDo:<br> I like to talk to foreigners.<br> It is not polite to speak of people<br> in a country you are visiting as foreigners.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> It was swell of you to take him<br> off our hands a while.<br> That little Joe.<br> He knows when he's with nice people.<br> - May I borrow him again?<br> - Yes.<br> He's a fine baby.<br> - And you have fine children.<br> - Thank you.<br> - May I come with you?<br> - Yes.<br> BoDo: You are Italian?<br> - Italian, yes, but American.<br> Do you know a Tullio Tipaldi<br> who fought in Spain with Papa?<br> - No.<br> - You ought to.<br> He was a soldier<br> of much excellence in Spain.<br> So was Papa. Papa was brave, he was calm,<br> he was expert, he was resourceful...<br> My biographer.<br> And as accurate as most of them.<br> - You are German?<br> - Yes.<br> - What side do you fight on in Spain?<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> Be still, Papa says.<br> I fought with the army of the Republic.<br> I am not a Nazi or a fascist.<br> I'm a big fool. I beg your pardon.<br> Don't... Forgive me, please.<br> I might have known which side<br> a man like you would be on.<br> It used to make me feel good...<br> ...that Italians and Germans<br> went to fight against the fascists in Spain.<br> Kind of showed people<br> that all Germans and Italians weren't...<br> - Are you just come from Europe?<br> - Yes.<br> What's happening over there?<br> I can't make any sense out of what I read.<br> Nobody seems to be doing anything,<br> and no fighting, I mean.<br> It will come soon now, I think.<br> But ain't there some chance the German<br> people themselves will kick Hitler out?<br> You read about men<br> in underground organizations.<br> - Is that just talk?<br> KURT: No.<br> It is not talk.<br> These men, in what you call<br> underground organizations...<br> ...work most hard and in great danger.<br> But...<br> Well, it looks bad to me.<br> It is not all black.<br> Take my word.<br> There are men in your country<br> and in mine who fight on.<br> I know.<br> - I have friends among them.<br> - What do you do?<br> - I mean, what's your trade?<br> - I?<br> I fight against fascism.<br> That is my trade.<br> [VACUUM BUZZING]<br> Try it there, Horace.<br> - It won't fit in there, Miss Fanny.<br> - Nonsense. Try it.<br> No, that's awful.<br> It looks like a dentist's waiting room.<br> Take it out of there.<br> MELLIE:<br> Fanny. Really.<br> I've been sitting here waiting<br> for an hour to drive you to Washington.<br> All you're doing<br> is messing up this lovely room.<br> Joseph. Joseph.<br> - Yes'm?<br> - Find a place to put that sofa.<br> Put it back where it's been doing all right<br> for 15 years.<br> And you'd better get back<br> to your gardening.<br> There will be children. My grandchildren.<br> They will climb on furniture. I always did.<br> My grandchildren<br> will be healthy children...<br> ...so don't use any of your dainty,<br> sleazy materials.<br> - This isn't Mrs. Sewell's house.<br> - I had no children.<br> Therefore, it's impossible<br> for me to have grandchildren.<br> If I'd had a daughter,<br> I'd have named her Emmeline Lou.<br> Well, everything turns out for the best.<br> Have you got that list?<br> We're going into Washington.<br> [MUMBLING]<br> Very well.<br> You'll never have time to get all that.<br> I've got to have a fitting<br> on my evening dresses.<br> I never understand why you need<br> so many evening dresses, Mellie.<br> Do you lead a secret life at your age?<br> [SCoFFS]<br> MELLIE:<br> Oh, hello, Marthe.<br> Hello, Mrs. Sewell.<br> I think Marthe is a very pretty girl,<br> don't you, Fanny?<br> What? Oh, all the Randolphs<br> were good-looking.<br> - No matter what else they weren't.<br> - I reckon men find her most attractive.<br> Don't you think so, Fanny? Don't you think<br> she is most attractive to men?<br> I'm sure I don't know. I'm not a man.<br> Of course, Jennie Randolph<br> wanted her to marry nobility.<br> It was a brilliant wedding.<br> Remember, Fanny, in Paris?<br> Now, doesn't it seem strange<br> that she's back here?<br> And the circle is completed, as they say,<br> right in your house and...<br> What circle? What are you talking about?<br> Candy. I'll buy messy candy.<br> That's what my grandchildren would like.<br> Messy candy.<br> If you'd had grandchildren, Mellie,<br> heaven forbid...<br> ...they'd have been children who never ate<br> between meals, who were sickly.<br> All your family were sickly.<br> I think you've made up a good deal of it.<br> Licorice. That's what I'll buy.<br> MELLIE: Really, Fanny,<br> you've wasted all afternoon for me.<br> Now it's too late to try on my dresses.<br> Oh, do be careful of the candy, Mellie.<br> Close up the box.<br> Acting like a 6-year-old<br> over Sara's homecoming.<br> It might be better if you spent your time<br> worrying a little about David.<br> It isn't that I believe everything that Cora<br> says, but she says everybody is talking.<br> Especially after he took her<br> to the colonel's dinner party. People said...<br> What are you chattering about?<br> You must get new upper teeth, Mellie.<br> Nobody can understand a word<br> you say anymore.<br> - You used to have lovely teeth.<br> - You can't understand me.<br> You can't even understand that all<br> Washington's talking about your son...<br> ...and the Countess de Brancovis.<br> Everybody says it's serious too.<br> Not just, you know.<br> If it was just, you know,<br> people would gossip a little and then stop.<br> What is "just you know"? Mellie,<br> you're old enough to say what you mean.<br> Let me off at the next block.<br> I promised to fetch David.<br> Take these things home for me, darling,<br> and thanks for the car.<br> Do be careful of the packages, Mellie.<br> Don't let them bump around.<br> And be very careful when you take them out<br> and give them to Joseph himself.<br> Bye-bye, dear.<br> - Hello, Miss Drake.<br> - Hello, Mrs. Farrelly.<br> FANNY:<br> Come. Take me home.<br> I don't like that picture of your father.<br> It's not big enough. Get a bigger one.<br> Goodness, my Joshua was handsome.<br> Wasn't he?<br> C YRUS:<br> - Upon the warranties...<br> FANNY: Hello, Cyrus. Hello, Miss Hall.<br> - Fanny.<br> Cyrus, my German son-in-law<br> is coming tomorrow. He's an engineer.<br> The government or somebody<br> must have use for engineers.<br> Find him something really good, Cyrus.<br> How's Marjorie?<br> Looking her age, Fanny,<br> which you never do. It's remarkable.<br> Not very remarkable.<br> I was a great beauty. You remember, Cyrus.<br> We always remember. When Joshua<br> snapped you up, I was heartbroken.<br> All of Washington was heartbroken.<br> Most of it. Anyway...<br> Goodbye, Cyrus. And thanks for arranging<br> the fine job for my son-in-law.<br> Fanny, what kind of engineer is he?<br> What kind? Any kind.<br> What does Cyrus mean?<br> There are kinds of engineers.<br> Civil, mining, electrical.<br> He used to work for Dornier.<br> - I guess that would make him...<br> - He's all kinds of an engineer, I'm sure.<br> Goodbye, Cyrus.<br> Bring Marjorie for dinner.<br> But not soon. In about five or six years.<br> [GIGGLING]<br> How much longer do you think the<br> de Brancovises are going to be with us?<br> I don't know.<br> Now that Sara, Kurt and the children are<br> coming, even our house might be crowded.<br> I feel sorry for Marthe.<br> I suppose, after all, her mother was my<br> good friend, and Teck rather amuses me.<br> Plays good cribbage and tells jokes.<br> But that's not enough for a lifetime guest.<br> And they've been here six weeks.<br> Have they borrowed<br> much money from you?<br> - None.<br> - Don't bite me. I didn't know.<br> I hope you haven't<br> been urging them to stay.<br> You invited them, Mama.<br> They're your guests.<br> Oh, they were mine. But that was before<br> you became enamored of Marthe.<br> She was such as pretty young girl.<br> - I think she's still pretty.<br> - Naturally, or you wouldn't be so ardent.<br> I don't know why I say that.<br> You were ardent with that Carter girl.<br> And you couldn't<br> have thought her pretty.<br> She had a nice disposition.<br> Why not? Who would have spoiled her?<br> Oh, look here, David.<br> What is going on between you and Marthe?<br> I don't like that question, Mama.<br> Nothing is going on.<br> I like her very much. I hope she likes me.<br> I can assure you she does.<br> So can all of Washington.<br> There's a great deal of gossip<br> about both of you.<br> - Gossip?<br> - Oh, nothing serious.<br> Most of it is rather amusing.<br> There is nothing to gossip about.<br> That's never stopped anybody<br> from gossiping.<br> You and Marthe haven't been very good<br> at hiding whatever there is to hide.<br> You know, I wonder<br> whether it has reached Teck.<br> - Now, look here, Mama...<br> - I only wanted to say, David...<br> ...that I have a feeling that he isn't really<br> a very good-natured man.<br> Underneath the manners<br> and the calmness...<br> ...I have a feeling<br> he isn't good-natured at all.<br> - Enchanting evening. Good night, admiral.<br> - Good night, madame.<br> - A most pleasant good night, sir.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> - Good night, admiral.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> [SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]<br> [SPEAKING IN SPANISH]<br> [SPEAKING IN GERMAN]<br> [SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]<br> WoMAN 1: It's been a great pleasure<br> to have been here. Good night.<br> GENERAL:<br> Thank you. Good night.<br> MAN 1: I hope your stay,<br> Your Excellency, will be long.<br> GENERAL: Thank you. Good night, sir.<br> MAN 1: Good night.<br> I do not think I envy you, Dr. Klauber.<br> Envy me? Of course not.<br> Perhaps publishing a pro-Nazi paper<br> in the United States...<br> ...isn't the best of all occupations.<br> There may be no future in it, but it pays.<br> PHILl: Good night.<br> - I'll be expecting you on Wednesday.<br> PHILl:<br> Yes.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, baron.<br> - Glad to have seen you again.<br> - Good night.<br> [MAN 2 SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]<br> - Good night.<br> WoMAN 2: Good night.<br> Well, that should be enough<br> of the handshaking.<br> Are we ready?<br> PHILl:<br> How many of them come here?<br> Our Herr Hitler violates their morality<br> in the morning...<br> ...but by the evening, they've recovered<br> and they're here to dinner at the embassy.<br> And so it's gone in most places<br> in the world for over seven years.<br> One might almost suspect their morality.<br> KLAUBER: That would be cynical.<br> - I daresay.<br> Good evening, Blecher.<br> Herr Blecher, here first, as usual.<br> How was the tea party?<br> It was a distinguished gathering.<br> A tribute to the diplomacy<br> of the fatherland.<br> Don't put this in your paper...<br> ...but His Excellency acts the host<br> as if he were on a beer party in a cellar.<br> He's a dull man.<br> Ribbentrop did not send him here<br> to amuse people.<br> Then he's doing very well.<br> In my paper, he is all things to all men.<br> Tomorrow we will have a little talk<br> about your paper. You and I.<br> Gladly. The cost of everything rises.<br> Paper, ink, wages.<br> That is not what we will talk about.<br> It is generally supposed, Mr. Chandler...<br> ...that these little talks of Blecher's<br> are most instructive and unpleasant.<br> Baron von Ramme,<br> too much may be generally supposed.<br> A threat, Butcher Boy?<br> Butcher Boy. That is funny, yes.<br> We Nazis are always funny.<br> And we have a funny leader<br> with a funny mustache.<br> His name used to be Schicklgruber<br> and he was a paperhanger.<br> That too is funny. Yes.<br> And so we have divided the world<br> into two parts.<br> Those like you who want to work for us<br> or with us.<br> And those others who lie awake trembling<br> and hating us because they are afraid of us.<br> Tell me, is not that also funny?<br> No, I wouldn't threaten you, Phili.<br> You could not be handled that way.<br> With all your duties,<br> you still had time to make a study of me.<br> - You are not complicated.<br> - No?<br> No. Aristocrat.<br> Bred to government service.<br> Contemptuous of us and our methods,<br> but chiefly because we are not gentlemen.<br> Would be satisfied enough<br> doing the same things...<br> ...or worse,<br> under some stupid Hohenzollern.<br> Got too cynical to be really dangerous,<br> Baron von Ramme.<br> Bravo.<br> You make me ashamed<br> of being so simple.<br> Do Klauber for us.<br> Money. That is all. Nothing else.<br> He becomes too expensive.<br> But he will remedy that before it is too late.<br> - One makes a living.<br> PHILl: And Mr. Chandler?<br> A man who wishes to sell us<br> quantities of oil...<br> ...he has by some means<br> come into control of.<br> Later and always, he will<br> have other things to sell.<br> They always do.<br> - Now, look here. L...<br> - And oberdorff?<br> Oberdorff, I do not know. I have tried.<br> A pale lump of a man.<br> He sits. He observes. He says nothing.<br> He writes no letters. He gets none.<br> Perhaps he is of the secret police.<br> Perhaps he is even writing a book.<br> I do not give up. But I do not know.<br> His credentials are of the best.<br> We must see more of one another.<br> You've stumped Blecher.<br> Your credentials are of the best.<br> Perhaps he's a member<br> of the underground anti-Nazi movement.<br> [KLAUBER CHUCKLES]<br> That should be very amusing.<br> Perhaps he is even Max Freidank.<br> No, oberdorff's not Max Freidank.<br> I know Freidank.<br> You know the legendary hero<br> of the underground movement?<br> No legend. We were in school together.<br> Yes. And you and he met by accident<br> on a street in Prague in 1936.<br> He had with him a man called Gotter.<br> Oberdorff, I admire you more and more.<br> I feel slighted, Herr Blecher.<br> You haven't spoken of me.<br> Because it has not been necessary<br> to consider you, Count de Brancovis.<br> One knows, of course, the routine things.<br> Romanian, former diplomat. A gambler.<br> Like Phil, an aristocrat<br> who would rather be with his own class.<br> But the career goes a little wrong.<br> I do not know how or why,<br> but I make the guess.<br> I also make the guess that you, like<br> Mr. Chandler, are a man who sells things.<br> But I would guess also that at the moment,<br> you are a man who has nothing to sell.<br> - I'll call on you when I have.<br> - Good.<br> That's why I'm here.<br> TECK: Another stack of blues, please.<br> BLECHER: All right.<br> Your deal.<br> [BELL CLANGING]<br> Sara. Sara.<br> Been such a long, long time.<br> I got to thinking it would never happen.<br> David. David, darling.<br> Isn't it strange to see each other?<br> Where is everybody?<br> That's Mama.<br> She's expected you every minute,<br> though she knew when you were coming.<br> Now that the time's here,<br> she's off someplace else.<br> I'll find her.<br> I've always known you must have grown up<br> in a lovely house like this.<br> Sit down.<br> Be comfortable.<br> Is it allowed?<br> Yes, it is allowed.<br> The door of the home was not locked.<br> We just came in.<br> You find it curious to believe<br> there are people who live...<br> ...and do not need to watch, eh, Joshua?<br> It is strange. But it must be good, I think.<br> Yes.<br> Isn't it a lovely house?<br> I'd almost forgotten.<br> That was my father...<br> ...when he was the famous<br> Joshua Farrelly.<br> We were very proud of him.<br> Almost 18 years.<br> You were born here, Mama?<br> Upstairs.<br> David and I used to have<br> our own garden across the pond.<br> I like a garden.<br> I've always hoped that some day we'd have<br> a home of our own and settle down and...<br> [SIGHS]<br> I'm talking so foolish.<br> Sentimental.<br> At my age.<br> Gardens and homes.<br> - I haven't wanted anything.<br> - Now stop that, Sara.<br> This is a fine room, fine place to be.<br> Everything is so pleasant<br> and full of comfort.<br> That will be a good piano<br> on which to play again.<br> And it is all so clean. I like that.<br> You must enjoy your house, Sara.<br> You shall not be a baby. You shall not be<br> afraid that you will hurt me...<br> ...because I have not given you<br> a house like this.<br> - Yes?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> It's strange, that's all. We've never been<br> together in a place like this.<br> Oh, but that does not mean<br> and should not mean...<br> ...that we do not remember<br> how to enjoy what comes our way.<br> We are on a holiday.<br> ANISE:<br> Miss Sara.<br> Miss Sara.<br> SARA:<br> Anise.<br> I would have known you.<br> Yes, I would. I would have.<br> You look the same.<br> I think you look the same.<br> Just the way I've always remembered.<br> This is the Anise<br> I've told you so much about.<br> She was here long before I was born.<br> How do you do, sir? How do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> Thank you. We are in good health.<br> Madame Fanny will have a fit.<br> Where is she?<br> - You are French, Madame Anise?<br> ANISE: Yes. From the Bas-Rhin.<br> Sara's husband, that is nice. That is nice.<br> Yes, your accent is from the north.<br> That is fine country.<br> We were in hiding there once.<br> ANISE: Hiding. You were in hiding?<br> FANNY: Sara.<br> Hello, Mama.<br> Sara. Sara, darling. You're here.<br> You're really here.<br> Welcome. Welcome.<br> Welcome to your house.<br> - You're not young, Sara.<br> - No, Mama.<br> - I'm 38.<br> - Thirty-eight. Of course.<br> You look more like your father now.<br> That's good. The years have helped you.<br> Welcome to this house, sir.<br> Thank you, madame.<br> You're a good-looking man for a German.<br> I like a good-looking man. I always have.<br> And I like a good-looking woman.<br> I always have.<br> [SPEAKS IN GERMAN]<br> Yes, I am your grandmother. Also,<br> I speak German, so don't talk about me.<br> I speak languages well.<br> But there's no longer anyone to speak with.<br> Anise has half forgotten her French and...<br> oh, it's good to have you home.<br> I keep chattering away...<br> JoSHUA:<br> Now you have us, madame.<br> We speak ignorantly but fluently<br> in German, French, Italian, Spanish...<br> And sometimes boastfully in English.<br> There is never a need of boasting.<br> If we are to fight<br> for the good of all men...<br> ...it is to be accepted<br> that we must be among the most advanced.<br> My goodness. Are these your children<br> or are they dressed-up midgets?<br> These are my children, Mama.<br> This, Babette. This, Joshua.<br> This is Bodo.<br> You were named for your grandfather.<br> You bear a great name.<br> Two great names.<br> My last name is Muller.<br> Yes.<br> You look a little like your grandfather.<br> And so do you. You're a nice-looking girl.<br> That's good.<br> You look like nobody.<br> Yes, I am not beautiful.<br> Well, Sara, well. Three children.<br> You've done well.<br> You too, sir, of course.<br> - But you don't look well.<br> - Oh, it is only that I am a little tired.<br> - In a short while, I will be all right. L...<br> FANNY: You look more than tired.<br> - We must take good care of you.<br> - Thank you. Thank you.<br> That was my Joshua.<br> We were very much in love.<br> Hard to believe of people nowadays,<br> isn't it?<br> No. Kurt and I love each other.<br> But there are ways and ways of loving.<br> - How dare you, Mama.<br> - Ladies. Ladies.<br> I was almost mad then.<br> I don't think I've been mad<br> since I last saw you.<br> We must not get angry.<br> Anger is protest and should only be used<br> for the good of one's fellow men.<br> That is correct, Papa?<br> If you grow up to talk like that<br> and stay as ugly as you are...<br> ...you're going to have one of those careers<br> on the lecture platform.<br> [JoSHUA LAUGHING]<br> It is a great pleasure<br> to hear Grandma speak with you.<br> I think I shall wash you.<br> Wash us? Do people wash each other?<br> No. But the washing is a good idea.<br> Run along now and change your clothes.<br> Come.<br> SARA: And then we'll all<br> have a fine, big lunch again.<br> FANNY:<br> Again?<br> Don't you usually have a good lunch?<br> No, madame, only sometimes.<br> We do all right usually.<br> It's good to be here.<br> I want to see everything.<br> My old room, and the lake and...<br> - Haven't I fine children?<br> - Very fine.<br> You're lucky. I wish I had them.<br> How could you? All the women you like<br> are too drafty, if you know what I mean.<br> [CHUCKLING]<br> None of them could have children.<br> Which, as God in his wisdom,<br> would have it.<br> Mama hasn't changed. That's good too.<br> - I hope you'll like me.<br> - I hope so.<br> I have fine plans.<br> I'm having the wing done over for you,<br> walls taken out...<br> oh, that's very kind of you, Mama,<br> but we won't make any plans for a while.<br> A good long vacation for Kurt and...<br> A vacation? You're staying, of course.<br> David is seeing schools for the children.<br> Cyrus Penfield has promised<br> to find an engineering post for Kurt.<br> But I have not worked as an engineer<br> since many years, madame.<br> Haven't you?<br> Well, didn't you work for Dornier?<br> Yes...<br> ...but before '33.<br> You must have worked in other places.<br> Many other places.<br> Every letter of Sara's seemed<br> to have a new postmark.<br> KURT:<br> Well, we moved most often.<br> You gave up engineering?<br> Gave it up?<br> - Well, one could say it that way.<br> - What do you do?<br> - Mama, we...<br> KURT: It is very difficult to explain.<br> - Lf you'd rather not...<br> - No, I'm trying to find out something.<br> - May I ask it right out?<br> - Let me help you, madame.<br> You wish to know<br> whether not being an engineer...<br> ...buys adequate lunches for my family.<br> It does not.<br> I have no wish to make a mystery<br> of what I've been doing.<br> It is only that it is awkward<br> to place it neatly.<br> It sounds so big. And it is so small.<br> I am an anti-fascist.<br> And to answer your question,<br> that does not pay well.<br> But we are all anti-fascists.<br> Yes, but Kurt works at it.<br> What kind of work?<br> Any kind. Anywhere.<br> - I will stop asking questions.<br> - Yes, Mama, that would be sensible.<br> Darling, don't be angry.<br> We've been worried about you, naturally.<br> We knew so little<br> except that you were having a hard time.<br> SARA: I didn't have a hard time. We never...<br> KURT: Do not lie for me, Sara, please.<br> I'm not lying.<br> I didn't have a hard time<br> the way they mean. Not ever.<br> For almost 12 years,<br> Kurt went to work every morning...<br> ...and came home to me every night<br> and we lived modestly and happily.<br> As happily as people could in a starved<br> Germany that was going to pieces.<br> Sara, please.<br> - I do not like you to be angry.<br> - Well, l...<br> Let me try to find a way<br> to tell it with quickness. Yes.<br> I was born in a town called Frth.<br> And we have a holiday in this town.<br> We call it Kirchweih.<br> It was a gay holiday with games, music<br> and hot white sausage to eat with the wine.<br> When I grow up, I move away to school,<br> to work, get married.<br> But I always come back for Kirchweih.<br> For me, it is the great day of the year.<br> After the war, the First World War,<br> that day begins to change.<br> The sausage begins<br> to be made of bad stuffs.<br> Country people come in without shoes.<br> Children are too sick.<br> It is bad for my people, those years.<br> But always, I have hope.<br> In the festival of August 1931,<br> more than a year before the Nazi storm...<br> ...I find out that hope by itself<br> is not enough.<br> On that day, I see 27 men murdered<br> in a Nazi street fight.<br> I cannot longer just look on.<br> My time has come to do more.<br> I say with the great Luther:<br> "I must make my stand.<br> I can do nothing else.<br> God help me. Amen."<br> We had seen the evil coming every day,<br> more and more.<br> But that festival<br> was the symbol of the end.<br> It hit Kurt hard.<br> It doesn't pay in money<br> to fight for what we believe in.<br> But I wanted it the way Kurt wanted it.<br> I always will.<br> Kurt is not very well.<br> There aren't many parts of Europe<br> anymore where... Where he could rest.<br> You've always said you wanted us.<br> So Kurt brought us home.<br> If you don't want us, we will understand.<br> DAVID:<br> We want you very much.<br> Forever, or however long you want.<br> I'm old and made of dry cork<br> and bad-mannered. Forgive me.<br> Oh, be still, Mama.<br> We're all being foolish.<br> I only want to be foolishly happy.<br> - Is our old garden still there?<br> - No.<br> But we've made the pond larger<br> and put blackberries on the island.<br> Oh, let's go.<br> Go on.<br> You're a kind woman, madame.<br> That's what she's always said.<br> I have disrespectful children.<br> [KURT CHUCKLES]<br> My children are together again.<br> That makes me feel good.<br> Come now,<br> you shall have a rest before lunch.<br> I shall send you up a sherry<br> and some biscuits.<br> And perhaps an eggnog too.<br> I'm a great believer in eggnogs<br> if they have enough liquor in them.<br> - How do you do?<br> - This is the Count de Brancovis.<br> He and his wife are staying for a while.<br> My son-in-law, Kurt Muller.<br> KURT:<br> How do you do?<br> Would it be impertinent for one<br> European to make welcome another?<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Have we met before, Mr. Muller?<br> Did you live in Paris?<br> I was in the legation there and I thought...<br> No, we have not met before.<br> If it is possible to believe,<br> I am the exile who is not famous.<br> Strange. I have a feeling...<br> It is interesting. I have always had<br> a good ear for the accents of your country.<br> But yours is most difficult to place.<br> Is it South German or...?<br> My accent is difficult to place,<br> Count de Brancovis...<br> ...because I speak other languages.<br> - Yours would be Romanian?<br> - Goodness. Is it as bad as that?<br> My grandchildren are charming.<br> You shall see them.<br> - Your grandchildren have to be charming.<br> - Of course.<br> Papa, this is the house of great wonders.<br> Each has his bed.<br> Each has his bathroom.<br> The arrangement of it,<br> that is splendorous.<br> You're a fancy talker, Bodo.<br> Oh, yes. In many languages.<br> Please do correct me when I am wrong.<br> Papa, the plumbing is such<br> as you have never seen.<br> Here, each implement<br> is placed on the floor.<br> And all are simultaneous<br> in the same room.<br> You will therefore see<br> that being placed solidly on the floor...<br> ...allows of no rats, rodents or crawlers,<br> and is most sanitary.<br> Papa likes to know<br> how each thing is put together.<br> And he is so fond of being clean.<br> I am a hero to my children.<br> It bores everybody but me.<br> Yes, it is a fine bathroom.<br> Better than in Brussels, eh?<br> Well, trapping the mice there<br> was most interesting.<br> Goodness. And now you must have<br> your rest before lunch.<br> I hear they've arrived.<br> Have you met them?<br> What has David told you<br> about Herr Muller?<br> What has David told me?<br> Nothing more than he's told you.<br> - What is there to tell?<br> - I do not know, but I would like to.<br> David said they'd been in Czechoslovakia,<br> Denmark, Poland, France and Switzerland.<br> These are all countries that Germany<br> has either threatened or gone into.<br> It is the German practice to send into<br> such countries men to prepare the way.<br> I had thought Herr Muller...<br> ...might be such a man.<br> I do not think so now.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Wondering why luggage is unlocked.<br> And a shabby briefcase<br> is so carefully locked.<br> You're very curious about Mr. Muller.<br> I'm curious about a daughter<br> of the Farrellys...<br> ...who marries a German<br> who has bullet scars...<br> ...and broken bones in his hands.<br> Is he any business of yours?<br> - Why, anything might be my business now.<br> - Yes, unfortunately.<br> Well, you sound very bitter<br> about me, Marthe.<br> Are you in love with David?<br> - What kind of talk is this?<br> - Answer me.<br> I like him.<br> Yes, and he likes you.<br> Please find out from him<br> about Herr Muller.<br> I will certainly do no such thing.<br> Ask your friends at the embassy.<br> They always know their nationals.<br> Yes. But I do not like to ask questions<br> without knowing the value of the answers.<br> Teck, leave these people alone.<br> They've evidently had a tough enough time.<br> I won't let you interfere.<br> Won't let me interfere?<br> You are in love with David.<br> Do not make any plans, Marthe.<br> You will go with me<br> when I am ready to go.<br> On Saturday, Madame Fanny and I<br> arrived at Savitt's.<br> Before that I have taken<br> all the measurements in secret.<br> First, Madame Fanny has delivered<br> a most sharp ultimatum...<br> ...that all must be finished in a week.<br> Savitt's?<br> What must be finished in a week?<br> Clothes for all of you. In an amount<br> you have not previously considered.<br> Dresses, suits, summer clothes,<br> stockings.<br> All must be done with the hand sewing.<br> How nice. How very, very nice of Mama.<br> What is so nice of Mama?<br> You are to say nothing. I gave my word.<br> Everything is nice of Mama.<br> Mama is a great darling.<br> Certainly. We've been in the attic<br> looking over some old books.<br> You know, I find that Joshua<br> is an educated boy.<br> Your father would have liked that.<br> Goodness.<br> You are a handsome woman, Sara.<br> - Where did the dress come from?<br> - From me. I make it.<br> Remember when I was a little girl<br> and you taught me to sew?<br> That came in handy years later.<br> Often when Kurt...<br> When Kurt was away for a long while...<br> ...I made dresses and earned enough<br> to pay the rent and food...<br> ...and send the children to school.<br> FANNY:<br> You sewed for a living?<br> Really, were these things necessary?<br> Why couldn't you have written to us?<br> Mama, you've asked me that 20 times<br> in the four days we've been here.<br> I think it is only that Grandma<br> feels sorry for us.<br> Grandma has not seen<br> much of the world.<br> She does not understand that a great many<br> work hard in order that they eat.<br> Now, don't you start giving me lectures.<br> I get enough from Bodo. Come along.<br> Psst.<br> [WHISPERING]<br> Ask Herr Muller to come up here.<br> - Why?<br> - Why? Why?<br> Because he is a man in love with his wife<br> and because his wife looks most beautiful.<br> You are getting so old<br> you no longer understand...<br> ...the matters of delicacy<br> between the men and the women.<br> [LAUGHS]<br> Me?<br> I had forgotten.<br> Liebe, Sara. You are beautiful.<br> How many years<br> have I kept you from looking like that?<br> It makes you have tears.<br> It also makes me have tears.<br> If you say that, I'll tear it off.<br> No. No.<br> Then I do not say it.<br> I do not think it.<br> I only think with pride<br> how beautiful is my Sara.<br> Anise has put me together with pins.<br> I'm a porcupine.<br> If you had not married me<br> so many years ago...<br> ...would you have married me today?<br> I'm so tired, so shabby.<br> And you are so...<br> I would have married you<br> any day in my life.<br> With Mama, what you need is not to be<br> afraid of making a fool of yourself.<br> Anything she doesn't like,<br> she makes seem silly.<br> Yes. And it's worked<br> for a good many years.<br> She thinks of me only<br> as a monument to Papa.<br> And a not-very-well-made monument<br> at that.<br> Yes. And since you're worth a good deal<br> on your own, do what you want.<br> Marthe's a nice girl, I think.<br> Kurt thinks so too,<br> and Kurt's smart about people.<br> You are very much in love with Kurt.<br> Oh, yes. I've been a happy woman.<br> David, Kurt's a sick man.<br> Sicker than he knows.<br> The wound he got in Spain<br> never healed right.<br> And then about six months ago over there...<br> oh, he's better.<br> Even the week here has done him good.<br> But he'll never be able to go back<br> and do the kind of work...<br> You know, darling...<br> ...I don't think I understand<br> what kind of work he was doing.<br> SARA:<br> Come along, Babbie.<br> How long has Marthe<br> been married to the count?<br> I don't know. When she was very young.<br> You know,<br> the Count de Brancovis scares me a little.<br> Scares you?<br> You and Mama,<br> most people here, I guess...<br> ...you don't know what it is<br> to be frightened.<br> Unfortunately,<br> I think you'll have to learn.<br> Uncle David, I have invited<br> the Countess Marthe...<br> ...to join our sightseeing trip.<br> I hope you find it agreeable.<br> Very, very agreeable.<br> - You're a nice girl, Babbie.<br> - Thank you, Mama.<br> To look down at such a great height<br> makes even me dizzy.<br> Where is our house?<br> Uh...<br> See beyond the city?<br> Yes.<br> Where the road bends away<br> from the river, through the trees?<br> - Yes.<br> - Back of that.<br> JoSEPH: But, Miss Fanny, you know<br> I've always been a good silver cleaner.<br> - You're getting out of practice.<br> - I have given it careful thought.<br> Miss Sara is better-looking.<br> Don't you think so, Joseph?<br> Don't you think Miss Sara<br> is better-looking than Miss Fanny?<br> You call that good cleaning?<br> That silver has lasted for 200 years<br> and it's going to last for 200 more.<br> Not the way you treat it, Miss Fanny.<br> Why, sometimes you scratch it.<br> I watch you at the table<br> and I say to myself:<br> "There's Miss Fanny,<br> doing it to that knife again."<br> I was using a knife and fork<br> before you arrived to show me how.<br> You told me the next time you screamed<br> at me to remind you to ask my pardon.<br> FANNY: You call that screaming?<br> - Yes'm.<br> All right.<br> I ask your pardon.<br> Now clean that silver.<br> It's very warm in Washington today.<br> You'll forgive us.<br> We are dining in town tonight.<br> - I will forgive you.<br> - You seen Marthe?<br> She went on the sightseeing trip<br> with the children.<br> - And David.<br> - Oh.<br> Well, I daresay she'll be back<br> in plenty of time to dress for dinner.<br> I hope so.<br> Baron von Ramme, please.<br> Phili? How are you?<br> The other night in the poker game,<br> you mentioned a man called Freidank.<br> Wasn't that his name?<br> Yes. Max Freidank. I think you said<br> you went to school with him.<br> What does he look like?<br> That is not my department.<br> That I have not as yet reached.<br> Blecher, the bloody Butcher Boy,<br> is perhaps your man.<br> If you're up to what I think,<br> you're wasting your time.<br> Max Freidank, more dead than alive<br> from wounds...<br> ...was arrested in Frankfurt<br> a few days ago.<br> - What?<br> PHILl: It's in the papers this afternoon.<br> You've come a long way,<br> haven't you, Teck?<br> Hello. L...<br> Hello.<br> Home again.<br> Shall I wait for you, Sara?<br> SARA:<br> No. Go along downstairs.<br> I find I'm becoming very vain.<br> It takes me a long time to get dressed.<br> Each night now, I wait for you<br> to tell me if I look nice.<br> Herr Muller, all day a discussion<br> has been raging.<br> You shall settle it.<br> Who is the better-looking,<br> Miss Sara or Madame Fanny?<br> Many years away, of course.<br> FANNY:<br> I don't consider him an impartial judge.<br> Both are of a great beauty.<br> I am not a man<br> who walks himself into trouble.<br> No. I should not think you were.<br> [KURT PLAYING PIANo]<br> - Mellie Sewell called this afternoon.<br> - With more gossip?<br> Mrs. Sewell brings Mama<br> all the news of Washington.<br> She gets it all wrong,<br> but that doesn't worry either Mama or her.<br> Mama fixes it.<br> "Wits it up," Papa used to say.<br> Certainly, I sharpen it.<br> Mellie has no sense of humor.<br> - Twenty-five.<br> - Did you know the old Baron von Ramme?<br> Yes. He was stationed in Paris<br> when I was there.<br> FANNY: I forget that you were a diplomat.<br> - It's just as well.<br> Something insane<br> about a Romanian diplomat.<br> Pure insane. Twenty-eight with a pair.<br> Well, I could have married<br> old Baron von Ramme.<br> Any American, not crippled,<br> whose father had money.<br> He was crazy about me.<br> Most men were in those days.<br> Later, when he was ambassador and had<br> married the rich, hideous Calloway girl...<br> ...someone asked<br> if I didn't regret not marrying him.<br> I said, "I regret it every day<br> and I'm happy about it every night."<br> You understand what I mean?<br> Styles in wit change so.<br> DAVID: We understood.<br> TECK: Go.<br> [WHISPERING]<br> The briefcase has been opened.<br> [SARA PLAYING PIANo]<br> There's no money missing,<br> but the case has been examined.<br> The gun was put back<br> in a different place.<br> TECK:<br> Seventeen for goal.<br> FANNY: Oh, as I was saying,<br> Mellie Sewell told me...<br> ...that you were playing<br> in a gambling game...<br> ...at the German Embassy<br> with the young Phili von Ramme...<br> ...and Sam Chandler, who is a relative<br> of mine and who's always been a scandal.<br> Nazis and Sam Chandler<br> must make an unpleasant game.<br> I do not gamble to be amused.<br> Oh, really? Then we'll certainly stop.<br> I owe you $8 and 50 cents.<br> Herr Muller,<br> the young Baron von Ramme...<br> ...was your government military attach<br> in Spain.<br> My government attach?<br> He was the German government attach<br> in Spain.<br> I know his name, of course.<br> But he was not attached to the side<br> on which I fought.<br> TECK:<br> I thought you might have known him.<br> We do not know Nazis,<br> Count de Brancovis.<br> No? I should have known that.<br> You are people who have lived<br> close to the borders of Germany.<br> You, therefore, must have had hopes<br> that National Socialism...<br> ...would be overthrown<br> on every tomorrow.<br> We have not given up that hope.<br> - Have you?<br> - I never had it.<br> Then it must be most difficult<br> for you to sleep.<br> What is that you're playing?<br> It was a German soldier's song.<br> They sang it as they straggled back in ' 18.<br> I remember hearing it in Berlin.<br> - Were you there then, Herr Muller?<br> - I was not in Berlin.<br> - But you were in the war, of course.<br> - Yes, I was in the war.<br> You didn't think then you'd live<br> to see another war.<br> Many of us were afraid we would.<br> All of us haven't been so isolated<br> as you seem to have been in this house.<br> What are the words?<br> This is what you heard in 1918 in Berlin.<br> [SINGING IN GERMAN]<br> [SINGING]<br> We come home, we come home<br> Some of us are gone<br> Some of us are lost<br> But we are friends<br> Our blood is on the earth together<br> Someday, someday we shall meet again<br> Farewell<br> And then at quarter to 6 in the morning<br> on November 7th, 1936...<br> ...18 years later, 500 of us Germans<br> were walking through the Madrid streets...<br> ...on our way to fight the fascist swine<br> along the Manzanares River.<br> We felt good that morning.<br> You know how it is to feel you're good<br> when it is needed to be good?<br> So we had the need of new words<br> to say that to ourselves.<br> I translate, of course,<br> with awkwardness, you understand?<br> [SINGING]<br> And so we have met again<br> The blood did not have time to dry<br> And we lived to stand and fight again<br> This time we fight for people<br> This time we'll keep their hands away<br> Those who sell the blood of other men<br> This time, they keep their hands away<br> For us to stand, for us to fight<br> This time, no farewell, no farewell<br> Well, we did not win.<br> It would have been a different world<br> if we had.<br> Herr Muller, it does<br> not seem natural to me...<br> ...that you should settle yourself<br> into this quiet, country life.<br> Perhaps.<br> When did you leave<br> the diplomatic service, count?<br> In 1931.<br> After the Budapest oil deal?<br> [CHUCKLES]<br> That must have been a thing<br> of high comedy, that conference.<br> Fritz Thyssen, who made the money<br> available for Hitler, was buying oil.<br> Everybody was trying to guess<br> whether this talk of National Socialism...<br> ...was just a smart blind of Thyssen's<br> or whether his rivals were...<br> It is too bad.<br> - You guessed an inch off, eh?<br> - More than that.<br> - And Nazis have good memories?<br> - Most uncomfortable memories.<br> You seem to know more about me<br> than I do about you.<br> And yet, I still have a feeling<br> that I've seen you or heard about you.<br> And that feeling has been so insistent<br> that I make guesses.<br> But bad guesses.<br> I thought you might be Max Freidank.<br> Freidank is a great hero to my people.<br> - You do me too much honor.<br> - Yes.<br> I found that out.<br> This is in today's Washington papers.<br> "Zurich, Switzerland:<br> Zurich papers reprinted today...<br> ...a dispatch from the Berliner Tageblatt<br> on the capture of Colonel Max Freidank.<br> Freidank is said to be the chief<br> of the anti-Nazi underground movement.<br> The son of the famous General Freidank,<br> he was a World War officer...<br> ...and a distinguished physicist<br> before the advent of Hitler."<br> That is bad news for you, Mrs. Muller?<br> I'm most sorry.<br> He was a friend of yours?<br> He was a friend to all decent Germans.<br> A friend to all decent people,<br> Count de Brancovis.<br> Well, it's what often happens to heroes,<br> unfortunately.<br> Marthe must be ready by now.<br> We will be back early, Herr Muller.<br> I do not like long dinner parties.<br> Your hands are shaking.<br> My hands were broken.<br> They are bad when I have fear.<br> Fear for Freidank, you mean?<br> I am a man who has many kinds of fears.<br> I do not think<br> you would understand that.<br> No. I do not think<br> I have ever been very frightened.<br> That is bad.<br> It is sometimes the road to trouble.<br> I daresay. Good night.<br> Kurt. Kurt.<br> It may not be true.<br> I am going to use the phone in your study<br> for a long-distance call, please.<br> - What is it, darling? What...?<br> - What is this all about, Sara?<br> I don't know all of it yet.<br> I do know that he broke open<br> Kurt's briefcase.<br> And he saw what we carry with us.<br> And he knows about Freidank...<br> ...which probably means<br> he's guessing about Kurt.<br> What do you mean, what you carry with you<br> and guessing about Kurt?<br> - L...<br> - Kurt works in an illegal organization.<br> He has for seven years.<br> We're carrying with us $23,000 dollars.<br> It's been collected here and in Mexico...<br> ...from the pennies and nickels<br> of poor people who don't like fascism...<br> ...and who believe in the work we do.<br> It was to be picked up and taken back<br> by the first men going.<br> Max and Kurt.<br> They loved each other.<br> They were in the war together.<br> And they were in Spain together.<br> Once in Spain,<br> Max made a medal from a ring.<br> "I make you a medal<br> because you're a fine soldier," he said.<br> And once, six months ago...<br> ...Max rescued Kurt from the Gestapo<br> on a train and Kurt was badly hurt.<br> Max carried him on his back<br> for seven miles across the border.<br> But they caught him in the end.<br> If Max was caught...<br> ...nobody's got much<br> of a chance anymore.<br> Nobody.<br> But wasn't it careless<br> to have $23,000 lying around to be seen?<br> No, it wasn't careless.<br> We've carried money that way for years.<br> There didn't seem to be any safer place<br> than my house.<br> It was careless of you and David<br> to have a man like that in this house.<br> - Yes. It was very careless.<br> - But how could we know?<br> The world has changed, Mama.<br> And some of the people in it<br> are dangerous.<br> It's time you knew that.<br> It is true.<br> But he is not dead.<br> Hans and Ernst were taken with him.<br> Max is not an easy man to kill.<br> But most of his face and one arm...<br> It is not nice when it comes.<br> Well, Sara...<br> - No.<br> - It must be yes.<br> But Max knows you're not well enough.<br> He sent you here.<br> But now I am more well than he is.<br> When?<br> I think tonight, Sara, darling.<br> But I do not know.<br> It will depend on<br> the Count de Brancovis.<br> What will depend upon the count?<br> Did he steal the money?<br> He's not a man who steals.<br> It will come another way.<br> But why are you afraid of him?<br> You're in this country now.<br> There's nothing he can do.<br> We will see.<br> We will wait and we will see.<br> Kurt's not going to be in this country.<br> He's going back to get them out.<br> Is that right, Kurt?<br> Is that right?<br> Yes, darling. I must try.<br> They were taken to Sonnenberg<br> and guards can be bribed there.<br> It has been done once before<br> at Sonnenberg.<br> I will try for it that way.<br> Of course you must go back.<br> I guess I was trying to think<br> it wouldn't come.<br> Kurt's got to go back.<br> He's got to go home.<br> It's hard enough to get back...<br> ...but if they knew he was coming...<br> They want Kurt bad.<br> All right, Kurt.<br> You'll do it. You'll get them out.<br> Kurt will do it. You'll see.<br> Don't be afraid, darling. You'll get back.<br> You'll get Max out all right.<br> And then you'll do his work, won't you?<br> And you'll do a good job.<br> The way you've always done.<br> Don't be afraid, darling.<br> You'll get home.<br> Yes, you will. You'll get home.<br> [SARA CRYING]<br> What is it, Mama?<br> You will be told later.<br> Don't worry now.<br> Will you go in to dinner, please?<br> We'll come in a minute.<br> Marthe...<br> ...much has been going wrong.<br> With us and between us.<br> But suppose... Suppose we could go back<br> to Europe again.<br> And with a little money.<br> Do you think we might pick up again<br> what we've lost?<br> What we've lost?<br> I don't think there was ever<br> very much to lose.<br> And I left nothing in Europe<br> that I'd want to go back to.<br> You have other plans?<br> If so, you're wasting your time.<br> I will tell you what to do.<br> We are leaving the Farrelly house.<br> You and I. You understand?<br> Anything going wrong back there?<br> - Drop me at the German Embassy.<br> - Like a hot potato, boss.<br> Now, go on to dinner.<br> I'll pick you up later.<br> Well, how did you manage<br> in the game the other night?<br> Count de Brancovis,<br> in this room I work.<br> That is commendable.<br> Your people caught Max Freidank.<br> Are there any others close<br> to Freidank perhaps that you want?<br> BLECHER:<br> We want them all.<br> If I should know where one or more<br> of such men could be found...<br> ...what would that information<br> be worth to your government?<br> It would depend on who they were<br> or where they were.<br> In the United States,<br> they would be worth very little.<br> - Nothing.<br> - Nothing at all?<br> What are we to do here?<br> Have them assassinated in an alley?<br> Kidnap them?<br> Follow them for months, hoping we'll know<br> when they go back to Germany?<br> Here are the lists.<br> With such men as these, that is not easy.<br> But show us where we can put our hands<br> on one of them in the fatherland...<br> ...or in any of the countries where we have<br> influence, that is another matter.<br> You could name your own price,<br> in reason.<br> We might also manage a visa for you.<br> I'm sure you are homesick<br> for shabby palaces and gaudy cafs...<br> ...and the rest of the decaying things<br> that represent Europe to you.<br> Blecher, we do not like each other.<br> But that will not stand in the way<br> of our doing business.<br> Would you stop that pacing about?<br> Please.<br> And tomorrow,<br> because it's Babbie's birthday...<br> ...I shall go and buy presents<br> for everybody.<br> We always do that here.<br> It started because I didn't like not getting<br> presents on other people's birthdays.<br> And we'll have music in the evening.<br> Yes. Yes, we'll have a fine time.<br> - You think you fool us.<br> - What?<br> Something has gone wrong.<br> Always Mama and Papa look like that<br> when it happens so.<br> You must not be nervous<br> for our sake, Grandma.<br> We will do whatever it is<br> Mama and Papa will ask of us.<br> Yes, you... You always have.<br> Now, would you go upstairs?<br> Later I will come and say good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> You're going away again,<br> aren't you, Papa?<br> Yes.<br> You must let me come along.<br> I will help in... In small ways.<br> I will learn. You will teach me.<br> I am not as yet a man...<br> ...and it would not be of such importance<br> if anything happened to me.<br> I will give you some rules now.<br> Please remember them, Joshua.<br> And never to disobey them.<br> Our forces are small.<br> Therefore, we must risk no more men<br> in any enterprise...<br> ...than it is needed to carry it out.<br> Always in our work,<br> a man will wish to go with you.<br> That is wrong.<br> We are not here<br> to show that we are brave...<br> ...and not to be modest, either, and say:<br> "I am not important.<br> Let me take the risk."<br> He takes the risk who is entitled to it.<br> Soon you will be a man.<br> Never have I doubted that for you.<br> Also...<br> ...this will be what a man<br> should most do.<br> I'm right?<br> Of course, Papa.<br> You are young.<br> You are smart. You are strong.<br> You are a fine investment for our work...<br> ...when the time comes.<br> In the meantime, I give you orders.<br> You think...<br> ...you've trained yourself<br> in mind and body.<br> Your day is not so distant.<br> If it should come<br> and I have not as yet returned...<br> It is not wise, perhaps,<br> to speak so far in the future...<br> ...but the world goes bad...<br> ...and who knows<br> how long that will last.<br> Therefore, with delicacy and care,<br> I wish you also to prepare Bodo...<br> ...when his time too shall come.<br> God help us.<br> Go upstairs now.<br> Say nothing to the others.<br> I will come later.<br> FANNY: Does Kurt intend<br> to bribe his friends out of prison?<br> - Is that what he said?<br> - Yes.<br> FANNY:<br> It's all very strange to me.<br> I thought things were so well run that...<br> What wonderful work<br> fascists have done...<br> ...in convincing people<br> they are men from legends.<br> They've done very well<br> for themselves, unfortunately.<br> But not by themselves.<br> We don't like to remember, do we,<br> that they came in on the shoulders...<br> ...of some of the most powerful men<br> in the world.<br> That makes us feel guilty<br> so we prefer to believe...<br> ...that they're mysterious men<br> from the planets.<br> Well, they aren't.<br> They're smart and they're sick...<br> ...and they're cruel.<br> But, given men who know<br> what they fight for, and will fight hard...<br> Yes.<br> Given men<br> who know what they fight for.<br> I will console you.<br> A year ago last month,<br> ...Freidank and I,<br> with two elderly pistols...<br> ...raided the home of the Gestapo chief<br> in Konstanz.<br> We got what we wanted,<br> and the following morning...<br> ...Freidank was eating his breakfast<br> three blocks away...<br> ...and I was over the Swiss border.<br> FANNY:<br> You are brave men.<br> I do not tell you the story<br> to prove that we are remarkable...<br> ...but to prove that they are not.<br> Would you like a drink?<br> You look... You look very tired.<br> It is waiting...<br> ...waiting that is bad for me.<br> FANNY: But I really don't understand<br> what you're waiting for.<br> Now, I mean.<br> I think the Count de Brancovis<br> will try tonight to find out who I am.<br> I wait now to see<br> if he has so found me out.<br> Beyond that, I myself,<br> do not understand.<br> But there's nothing he can do.<br> Waiting.<br> Once, in Spain...<br> ...I waited two days for the fascist planes<br> to exhaust themselves.<br> I say finally to myself,<br> if I must reach up with my naked hands...<br> ...I will stop them.<br> It is such waiting for which I am not fit.<br> You will not think that<br> when the time comes.<br> - It will go.<br> - Of a certainty.<br> But must it always be your hands?<br> For each man, his own hands.<br> He has to sleep with them.<br> That's right.<br> I guess it's the way we should all feel.<br> But... But you have a family.<br> Isn't there somebody else<br> who hasn't a wife and children?<br> Each could find his own excuse.<br> Some have bullet holes, some have fear<br> of the camps and many are getting older.<br> Each could find a reason. Many find it.<br> And my children are not the only children<br> in the world, even to me.<br> That's noble of you, of course, but...<br> one means always in English<br> to insult with that word, noble?<br> - Of course not.<br> - It is not noble.<br> It is only the way I must live.<br> FANNY:<br> But I was thinking of Sara.<br> I want it this way, Mama.<br> The way Kurt wants it.<br> You wanted a good life for your children.<br> We want it for ours too.<br> This is Kurt's way<br> of trying to get it for them.<br> Good evening.<br> There's something bad happening,<br> isn't there?<br> I have been to the German Embassy<br> tonight, Herr Muller.<br> Yes. That's where<br> I thought you would go.<br> I don't know what this is all about,<br> but I'm guessing, because I know Teck.<br> I have nothing to do with any of it. And<br> I have nothing to do with Teck anymore.<br> If you do not mean what you're saying,<br> change your mind.<br> You are talking most unwisely.<br> You are trying to frighten me.<br> But you're not going to anymore.<br> I'm not going away with you<br> and I'm never going away with you.<br> - Shall we talk about this alone?<br> - You can't make me stay with you.<br> You can't make stay now<br> that I'm not frightened anymore.<br> - No, perhaps not.<br> - Then there's nothing to talk about.<br> You're in love with him?<br> You never can understand anything<br> that hasn't got tricks to it.<br> I don't like you, Teck. I never have.<br> We will not leave here together<br> and we will not meet again.<br> Not now.<br> Good night.<br> Well...<br> A great many things have been said<br> in the past few minutes.<br> David, am I to understand...?<br> You are to understand anything you like.<br> Without Marthe,<br> I shall be a very lonely man.<br> Already, I'm a very poor one.<br> Before I go tonight,<br> I should like to have $ 10,000.<br> - You, blackmailing with your wife, you...<br> KURT: No, David.<br> The Count de Brancovis is not bargaining<br> with you or Marthe.<br> He is talking to me.<br> Is that correct?<br> Good.<br> I see that you understand.<br> I got from the embassy<br> a list and descriptions...<br> ...without, of course,<br> saying why I wanted them.<br> But if I have to take any more of that,<br> I shall go immediately back to them.<br> You will not again be interrupted.<br> Very well.<br> There were many names on the list.<br> And among the descriptions is this,<br> of a man we shall call Gotter...<br> ...because that is the name<br> he has most often used.<br> "Age, 40 to 45. About 6 feet.<br> One hundred and seventy pounds.<br> Many descriptions.<br> All of them unreliable.<br> Married to a foreign woman,<br> either English or American.<br> Three children.<br> Has used the names of Gotter,<br> Thomas Bodmor, Karl Francis.<br> Thought to have left Germany in 1933 and<br> to have joined the notorious Max Freidank.<br> Known to have crossed border in 1934,<br> February, May, June, october.<br> And again, with Freidank in 1935...<br> ...and in August, october,<br> November, 1936."<br> An active man, this Gotter.<br> Yes. Very.<br> It would've been impossible for a magician<br> to have crossed that often.<br> Really? Well, to go on.<br> "In 1934, outlaw radio station announcing<br> itself as Radio European begins to operate.<br> Gotter was known to have crossed border<br> before and after three of the broadcasts.<br> Gotter believed to have then appeared<br> in Spain with Madrid government army.<br> Known to have lived in France<br> the first months of 1938.<br> Again, crossed border<br> sometime during week...<br> ...when Hitler's Hamburg radio speech<br> was interrupted off the air."<br> That was a daring deed, Herr Muller.<br> I remember it well. It amused me.<br> - It was not done for that reason.<br> - No?<br> "Early in 1939, an informer in Konstanz<br> reported Gotter's arrival with Freidank...<br> ...carrying money<br> exchanged in Paris and Brussels.<br> Following day,<br> home of Konstanz Gestapo chief...<br> ...was raided by two men<br> who took spy list and escaped."<br> Herr Muller, that job took two good men.<br> Even you admire them.<br> TECK:<br> Even I.<br> Now, I think you are Gotter,<br> Thomas Bodmor, Karl...<br> Please do not describe me<br> to myself again.<br> I think that because Freidank has been<br> taken, you'll be traveling home.<br> If I am wrong, and you will not be going<br> back, the German Embassy will...<br> KURT:<br> I am going back.<br> I will start tonight.<br> So. You tell me free of charge.<br> Well, I will tell you free of charge...<br> ...that I do not believe<br> they've forced information out of Freidank.<br> Thank you.<br> But I was sure they would not.<br> I know all three most well.<br> They will be able to stand up under...<br> Under whatever is given them.<br> Yes. There is a deep sickness<br> in the German character.<br> A love of death, a love of pain.<br> - Spare us your moral judgments.<br> - Yes, they're sickening.<br> - Get on with your dirty business.<br> - Fanny and David are Americans.<br> They do not understand our world.<br> And if they are fortunate, they never will.<br> All fascists are not of one mind,<br> one stripe.<br> There are those who give the orders...<br> ...and there those who take them.<br> They came late.<br> Some of them were, up to a point,<br> fastidious men.<br> For these,<br> we may someday have pity.<br> They are lost men.<br> Their spoils are small.<br> Their days gone. Yes?<br> You have the understanding heart.<br> - Someday, it will get in your way.<br> KURT: I will watch it.<br> We are both men in trouble, Herr Muller.<br> The world, perhaps ungratefully, seems to<br> like your kind even less than it does mine.<br> Now let us do business.<br> You will not get back<br> if I inform the embassy that you are going.<br> - They will see that you are killed before.<br> - You are wrong.<br> I will not be killed before I get there.<br> I will get back.<br> There are men<br> they would like to have besides me.<br> I would be allowed<br> to walk directly to them.<br> Until they had all the names<br> and all the addresses.<br> Romanians would pick me up<br> ahead of time.<br> Germans would not.<br> - Still the national pride?<br> - And why not, for that which is good?<br> I haven't felt what I feel now. Whatever<br> you are and however you became it...<br> ...the picture of a man<br> selling other men's lives...<br> Is very ugly, Madame Fanny.<br> I do not do it without some shame.<br> And I must therefore<br> sink my shame in large money.<br> - You have over $20,000 in your briefcase.<br> - Yes. You are an expert with locks.<br> For $ 10,000 you can go back<br> to wherever you go.<br> No one will know that you go,<br> I will give you my wishes.<br> - What?<br> - No.<br> That money will go back with me<br> as it is.<br> It was not given to me to save my life<br> and I shall not so use it.<br> It is to save the lives<br> and further the work of more than I.<br> And it is important to me<br> to carry on that work.<br> And, Count de Brancovis...<br> ...the first morning when we arrived<br> in this country, my children were hungry.<br> That is because we were not able<br> to buy sufficient breakfast for them.<br> If I wouldn't touch that money for them,<br> I wouldn't for you.<br> It goes back with me as it is.<br> And if it does not get back,<br> it is because I will not get back.<br> TECK:<br> I do not think you will get back.<br> You're a brave one, Herr Muller,<br> but you will not get back.<br> I will send you a postal card<br> and tell you all about my bravery.<br> Is it true that if this swine talks,<br> you and the others...?<br> SARA:<br> Will be caught and killed.<br> If they're lucky enough<br> to be killed quickly.<br> All right. We'll give him the money.<br> Let's give it to him<br> and get him out of here.<br> Do you want him to go back?<br> Yes, I do.<br> DAVID:<br> All right.<br> You're a good girl, Sara.<br> If we give you the money, what's to keep<br> you from selling to the embassy?<br> I do not like your thinking I'd do that.<br> Look, I'm sick of what you'd like<br> or wouldn't like.<br> We'll get this over<br> without fancy talk from you.<br> I can't take much more of you<br> at any cost.<br> But it is your anger which delays us.<br> I suggest that you give me<br> a small amount of cash now...<br> ...and the rest in a check<br> dated a month from now.<br> In a month, Muller should be home,<br> let you know that he is safe...<br> ...and that I have kept my bargain. We are<br> taking chances on each other, of course.<br> But I suppose one always does<br> on a deal of such delicacy as ours.<br> DAVID: Is a month all right?<br> - What?<br> I do not know.<br> Two months. How do you want the check,<br> how do you want the cash?<br> One month. That I will not discuss.<br> One month. Please decide now.<br> All right. How do you want it?<br> Seventy-five hundred in a check,<br> Leave your address.<br> I'll send the money.<br> Address? I have no address.<br> And I wish it now.<br> I haven't that much cash in the house.<br> I have 15 or 1600<br> in the sitting-room safe.<br> Very well, that will do.<br> Make the rest in a check.<br> Get it, Mama.<br> The new world has left the room.<br> I feel less discomfort with you.<br> We are Europeans,<br> born to trouble and understanding it.<br> - My wife is not European.<br> - Almost.<br> They are young.<br> The world has gone well for most of them.<br> For us, the three of us...<br> ...we're like peasants<br> watching the big frost: Work, trouble, ruin.<br> But no need to call curses at the frost.<br> There it is. There it will be again.<br> Always for us.<br> Me and my husband and I do not have<br> angry words for you.<br> It goes deeper than that with us.<br> We know how many there are of you.<br> They don't, yet.<br> My mother and brother feel shocked<br> that you're in their house.<br> We have seen you in so many houses.<br> I do not say that you want<br> to understand me, Mrs. Muller.<br> I say only that you do.<br> Yes, you are not difficult to understand.<br> - Whiskey?<br> - No, thank you.<br> Brandy?<br> Thank you, I will.<br> You, too, wish to go back<br> to Europe, huh?<br> Yes.<br> But they do not much want you there.<br> I do not think the embassy<br> would pay you in money...<br> ...for a description of a man<br> who has a month to travel.<br> But I think they would pay you in a visa.<br> And I think you want a visa<br> almost as much as you want money.<br> I conclude that you will try for the money<br> here and for the visa from the embassy.<br> I cannot get anywhere near Germany<br> in a month and you know that.<br> I've been bored with this talk<br> of paying you money.<br> If they are willing to try you<br> in this fantasy, I am not.<br> Unlike you, I am not a gambler,<br> I do not take chances.<br> Get up, please.<br> [SPEAKS IN GERMAN]<br> I wish nobody to come outside.<br> Hello?<br> What time is your next plane?<br> To...<br> To south.<br> To El Paso or Brownsville.<br> Yes.<br> - Where is he, upstairs?<br> - They went out. Outside.<br> - They went outside?<br> - No, David. Don't go out.<br> Yes?<br> Oh, that's all right.<br> No, the ticket<br> will be picked up at the airport.<br> Uh...<br> Ritter.<br> R-l-T-T-E-R.<br> From Chicago. Yes.<br> Sara, what is this? What's happening?<br> No.<br> Don't interfere now.<br> Either of you.<br> I know when I'm a loser. I give my word.<br> Your word. What guarantees, what bonds<br> could hold such a man as you?<br> No substance to you.<br> Nothing that could be held to anything.<br> You are not even a coward.<br> If I try to frighten you into silence, by<br> tomorrow, you'd have forgotten your fear.<br> You are a fool.<br> You play with men's lives<br> to have money to live in worthlessness.<br> You and all your shabby kind.<br> Tonight, before you come home,<br> I pray for you.<br> I pray that you will have done nothing.<br> That I will not have to touch you.<br> I do not like to kill this way.<br> TECK: Listen to me, l...<br> - I have seen many men die.<br> I give you advice.<br> It is easier without words.<br> They will not now do you good.<br> You will be better without them.<br> [GUNSHoT]<br> I think it's all over now.<br> There's nothing you can do about it.<br> It's the way it had to be.<br> He's going away now.<br> I don't think<br> he'll ever come back anymore.<br> Never. Never, never.<br> I don't like to be alone at night.<br> I guess everybody in the world<br> has got a time they don't like.<br> Me, it's right before I go to sleep.<br> And now it's going to be for always.<br> All the rest of my life.<br> I've told them.<br> I've made you a reservation<br> on a midnight plane to Brownsville.<br> In the name of Ritter.<br> Liebe, Sara.<br> It is hard for you.<br> - I am sorry.<br> - Hard? I don't know.<br> I don't...<br> Before I come in...<br> ...I stand and think.<br> I say I will make Fanny<br> and David understand.<br> I say, "How can I?"<br> Does one understand the killing?<br> No.<br> So in the end, what is there to say?<br> Then do not try to explain, I say.<br> I do what must be done.<br> I have long sickened the words<br> when I see the man who live by them.<br> I've stopped a man's life.<br> I sit here and listen to him.<br> I want only for you to believe<br> that I pray it will not have to be...<br> ...and then I know<br> I will have to kill him.<br> I know if I do not,<br> it is only that I pamper myself...<br> ...risk the lives of others<br> as well as my own.<br> So I want you from the room.<br> I know what I must do.<br> All right.<br> Do I now pretend sorrow?<br> Do I now pretend<br> it is not I who acts thus? No.<br> I do it. I have done it before.<br> And I will do it again.<br> And I will always keep my hope...<br> ...that we may make a world<br> in which all man can die in bed.<br> I have great hate for the violent.<br> They are the sick of the world.<br> Maybe I am sick now too.<br> Oh, stop it, Kurt. That isn't true.<br> It's late. You have to go soon.<br> Yes.<br> Now I am going to take your car.<br> I will take him with me.<br> After that, it is up to you.<br> Two ways: You can let me go<br> and keep silent.<br> I believe I can hide him in the car.<br> At the end of two days,<br> if they have not been found...<br> ...you call your police, tell them as much<br> of the truth it is safe for you to say.<br> I will have left the country,<br> there'll be no doubt who did the killing.<br> If you will give me those two days...<br> ...I believe I will be far<br> enough away from here.<br> And if the car is found before then,<br> I will still try to move with speed.<br> I do not think for the world<br> you will be in bad trouble.<br> Inside yourselves...<br> ...that is for you to decide.<br> You may take the other way.<br> I'm going to say goodbye<br> to my children now.<br> That will give you time to call the police.<br> I will still leave,<br> but I will not get home.<br> Papa wrote it years ago.<br> Papa said the only men on Earth<br> worth their time on Earth...<br> ...were the men<br> who would fight for other men.<br> Papa said...<br> ...we have struggled through<br> from darkness.<br> But man moves forward with each day...<br> ...and each hour to a better, freer life.<br> That desire to go forward...<br> ...that willingness to fight for it...<br> ...cannot be put in a man.<br> But when it is there...<br> Please let him go back.<br> Of course, darling.<br> He'll have his two days.<br> We'll take care of things here.<br> It's a fine thing<br> to have you for a daughter, Sara.<br> I would like to have been like you.<br> We have said many goodbyes<br> to each other, huh?<br> Well, we will now<br> have to say another one.<br> But this time,<br> I will leave you with good people...<br> ...to whom you, I believe,<br> also will be good.<br> Would you allow me to give away<br> my share in you until I get back?<br> - Lf you would like it.<br> - Good.<br> Then, to Mama, her share.<br> My share to Fanny and David.<br> It is all and it is the most I have to give.<br> There.<br> I've made a will.<br> But now we will not joke.<br> I have something to say<br> and it is important to me to say it.<br> You are talking to us<br> as if we were children.<br> Am I, Babbie?<br> I wish you were children.<br> I wish I could say to you, love your mother,<br> do not eat too many sweets...<br> ...clean your teeth.<br> I cannot say these things to you.<br> You are not children.<br> I took your childhood all away from you.<br> We have had a most enjoyable life, Papa.<br> You are a gallant little liar.<br> And I thank you for it.<br> I have done something bad tonight.<br> - You could not do a bad thing.<br> BABETTE: You could not.<br> Now, let us get straight together.<br> The four of us.<br> Do you remember<br> when we read Les Miserables?<br> You remember<br> that we talked about it afterwards...<br> ...and Bodo got candy on Mama's bed?<br> I remember.<br> Well...<br> ...the man in the book stole bread.<br> "The world is out of shape,"<br> he said, "when there are hungry men."<br> And until it gets in shape,<br> men will steal and lie...<br> ...and kill.<br> But for whatever reason it's done,<br> and whoever does it...<br> ...you understand it, it is all bad.<br> I want you to remember that.<br> Whoever does it, it's bad.<br> But you will live to see the day<br> when it will not have to be.<br> All over the world,<br> in every place, every town...<br> ...there are men who are going<br> to make sure it will not have to be.<br> They want what I want.<br> A childhood for every child.<br> For my children, and I for theirs.<br> Think of that.<br> It will make you happy.<br> In every town, every village,<br> every mud hut in the world...<br> ...there is always a man<br> who loves children...<br> ...and who will fight<br> to make a good world for them.<br> Goodbye now.<br> Wait for me.<br> I shall try to come back for you.<br> Or you shall come to me.<br> The boat will come in<br> and it will be a fine and a safe land.<br> And I will be waiting<br> on the dock for you.<br> And there will be the three<br> of you and Mama, Fanny and David.<br> And I will have ordered<br> an extra big dinner...<br> ...and we will show them<br> what our country can be like.<br> Of course, Papa.<br> That is the way it will be.<br> Of course.<br> [SPEAKING IN GERMAN]<br> Do it well.<br> - Good night, baby.<br> - Good night, Papa.<br> [SPEAKS IN GERMAN]<br> - Good night, son.<br> - Good night, Papa.<br> [SPEAKS IN GERMAN]<br> You go with our blessing.<br> We will take care of things here.<br> David and I would like to give you<br> this money to use for your friends.<br> A thank you is too small. L...<br> Goodbye.<br> Good luck.<br> Men who wish to live<br> have the best chance to live.<br> I wish to live.<br> I wish to live with you.<br> Seventeen years.<br> It is as much for me today.<br> I have loved just once, and for all my life.<br> Come back for me, darling.<br> If you can.<br> I will try.<br> Goodbye to you all.<br> JoSHUA:<br> Bodo cries. Babette looks very queer.<br> I think you should come, Mama.<br> Bodo talks so fancy.<br> We forget sometimes he is a baby.<br> [ENGINE REVS]<br> Well...<br> ...we've been shaken out<br> of the magnolias.<br> Yes. So we have.<br> Yes.<br> Well, tomorrow will be a hard day.<br> But we'll have Babbie's birthday dinner<br> and we'll have music afterwards.<br> I think you'd better go up to Marthe now.<br> In the end, she will have to know.<br> Be as careful as you can.<br> Well, I think I'll go up and talk to Anise.<br> I like Anise best when I don't feel well.<br> Mama?<br> We're going to be in for trouble.<br> - You understand that?<br> - I understand it very well.<br> We will manage.<br> I'm not put together with flour paste.<br> And neither are you, I'm happy to learn.<br> Maybe we'll get a letter soon.<br> You can't tell.<br> After all, it isn't so easy to send word.<br> There have been long times before.<br> Don't you think so, Joshua?<br> Don't you think, maybe?<br> Maybe.<br> But you can't find Papa on a map.<br> JoSHUA:<br> No?<br> Are you using the map for your lessons?<br> No.<br> What do you mean, no?<br> What are you doing with that map?<br> Answer me, Joshua.<br> L... I was thinking<br> about ways to get home.<br> What are you talking about?<br> In five months, I will have a birthday.<br> If by then we have not yet had word<br> from Papa, I shall be going, Mama.<br> You have known it and I have known it.<br> But we have not wanted to speak of it.<br> What kind of talk is that?<br> You will not go.<br> You're only a child. I will not let you.<br> Do you hear me, Joshua?<br> I will not let you.<br> I do not believe that.<br> I believe that you will let me go.<br> I believe that when my time will come,<br> you will want me to go.<br> I believe too, and I'll say it now...<br> ...that you will tell Bodo<br> the things he needs to know...<br> ...and if the world stays bad so long...<br> ...you will send him after me<br> when his time comes.<br> You are a brave lady, Mama.<br> And that is the way<br> you will want things to be.<br> Thank you, son.<br> That was a nice thing to say.<br> I'm not brave.<br> It isn't like that at all.<br> When the time comes...<br> ...when it comes...<br> ...I will do my best.<br>
