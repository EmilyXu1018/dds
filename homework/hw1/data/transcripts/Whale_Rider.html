                        In the old days, the land felt a great emptiness.<br> It was waiting...<br> waiting to be filled up...<br> waiting for someone to love it...<br> waiting for a leader.<br> And he came on the back<br> of a whale...<br> a man to lead a new people.<br> Our ancestor, Paikea.<br> But now we were waiting<br> for the firstborn of the new generation...<br> for the descendant<br> of the whale rider...<br> - For the boy who would be chief.<br> Paikea.<br> Paikea.<br> There was no gladness<br> when i was born.<br> My twin brother died<br> and took our mother with him.<br> Rawiri.<br> Everyone was waiting<br> for the firstborn boy to lead us...<br> but he died...<br> and i didn't.<br> Where is the boy?<br> Son.<br> - What's done is done. Come home.<br> Come home.<br> Start again.<br> You mean just pretend<br> it didn't happen.<br> - That's not what i'm saying.<br> - You didn't even look at her, dad!<br> She died.<br> - Son...<br> - no, no, no!<br> No. No, all you want<br> is your boy.<br> - It's all right.<br> - That's all you want. Isn't it?<br> - You can start again.<br> - Hey, i've got a child.<br> Her name's Paikea.<br> - What?<br> - You heard me.<br> No. Not that name.<br> - It's Paikea.<br> - No!<br> Porourangi...<br> porourangi.<br> Porourangi!<br> Take her away.<br> - I told you to take her away.<br> No. You acknowledge<br> your granddaughter.<br> She likes you.<br> He'll have another child.<br> He just lost a child and a wife.<br> Isn't that enough?<br> You give that boy some time.<br> You hear me?<br> He'll be back<br> when he's ready.<br> Stupid old paka.<br> You say the word,<br> and i'll get a divorce, bub.<br> Just say the word.<br> - What'd he say to her?<br> - Same old story.<br> Not good enough<br> for him, is she?<br> He start that early<br> with me?<br> You're a man.<br> You can handle it.<br> Here. Better get used to it.<br> This one's gonna need someone<br> to look out for her.<br> Yeah. All right.<br> My koro wished<br> in his heart that i'd never been born...<br> but he changed his mind.<br> - Hey! You old paka!<br> Quick!<br> They were quick.<br> Must have let them off early or something.<br> - You've been smoking.<br> - Says you.<br> Maori women have got<br> to stop smoking.<br> We've got to protect<br> our childbearing properties.<br> You coming<br> to the concert?<br> - Might.<br> - Bet she's got her best gears<br> all laid out on the bed.<br> - My dad's coming.<br> - Nay? Better get my flash dress out then.<br> How long's he staying this time?<br> Five minutes?<br> Longer than that.<br> That's good, 'cause i blinked<br> and missed him last time.<br> What time's the concert, bub?<br> Gee, she's bossy,<br> that one.<br> And you'd have to be smoking in a pretty funny<br> place to wreck your childbearing properties.<br> If you ask me the name of this house,<br> i will tell you.<br> It is whitireia.<br> And the carved figurehead at the top?<br> It is Paikea. It is Paikea.<br> - No good to you, you reckon?<br> - Shh!<br> - What are they feeding you?<br> - You look different.<br> - Hmm. You do too. Must be growing up.<br> - Am not.<br> - Sorry i was late.<br> - It doesn't matter. It was stink anyway.<br> Oh.<br> Gotta look my best for your brother.<br> - Hey, bro.<br> - Rawiri?<br> - Good to see you, man.<br> - Yeah, put on a bit of weight<br> since i saw you last time.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey, this is<br> my new lady.<br> - Kia ora.<br> - Kia ora.<br> How many of my sons<br> you need, girl?<br> Give us a hand with the food.<br> Make yourself useful.<br> You too, Pai.<br> Come on, mate.<br> Let these important guys have their talk, eh?<br> Take your time.<br> They've been<br> waiting for you.<br> Been a while<br> this time, son.<br> Been away.<br> Didn't you get any of my postcards?<br> Your mother put something on the fridge.<br> I don't know what it was. A bridge or something.<br> France, probably.<br> I've been spending<br> a bit of time in germany too.<br> - Like you there, do they?<br> - Some of them do.<br> - So, you've been busy, then?<br> - Yeah. Yeah, it's been good.<br> You know, i got a gallery interested.<br> Had some good shows.<br> How about you?<br> We've been all right.<br> It's good to see you, dad.<br> It was my father's waka...<br> but after i was born he didn't<br> want to carve it anymore.<br> He went away.<br> Everybody did.<br> - Sorry, mum.<br> - You've come a long way.<br> I think you can have a sleep in.<br> - Isn't he having any breakfast?<br> - Septic tank's blocked down at the marae.<br> Can't somebody else do it?<br> Eat your breakfast. You're too skinny.<br> Can't hardly see your bum in those pants.<br> Thanks, ma.<br> Thanks, ma.<br> Your timing's spooky, boy.<br> Nerd!<br> Putt-putt-putt!<br> - Ah! What was that for?<br> - For the concert last night.<br> You have more respect next time.<br> - That teacher of yours got herself a husband yet?<br> - Don't think so.<br> She still got those things on her teeth?<br> Paka, at school we gotta do a speech<br> on where we come from and that.<br> So anyway, you know how<br> we all came on a whale?<br> That's right.<br> But where does<br> the whale come from?<br> - From hawaiiki.<br> - Where's that?<br> It's where we lived before we came here,<br> where the ancestors are.<br> - So, Paikea came from there.<br> - Ae.<br> - How long ago?<br> - Long time.<br> But how long?<br> See that there?<br> Look at it closely.<br> What do you see?<br> - Lots of little bits of rope all twisted together.<br> - That's right.<br> Weave together the threads of Paikea<br> so that our line remains strong.<br> Each one of those threads<br> is one of your ancestors...<br> all joined together and strong...<br> all the way back<br> to that whale of yours.<br> Useless bloody rope.<br> I'll get another one.<br> Paka! Paka!<br> It's working!<br> It's working.<br> - I don't want you to do that again.<br> It's dangerous.<br> That's a good one.<br> Come in.<br> - A seat for you over there.<br> - Kia ora.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi. Kia ora.<br> Have you met Pai's father?<br> Porourangi...<br> this is miss parata<br> from the school.<br> - Kia ora.<br> - Kia ora.<br> - Thought she'd appreciate seeing the show.<br> - No problem.<br> This is some of my work<br> from my last exhibition in germany.<br> Start again, from the beginning.<br> She wants to see all of it.<br> All right.<br> Yeah, like i was saying,<br> uh... oh, sorry.<br> Who's that, bro?<br> Anna. It's a woman<br> i've been seeing.<br> Actually, she's pregnant.<br> We're expecting a child.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> Congratulations, bro.<br> You always get the good-looking ones.<br> Where is she?<br> Why don't you bring her?<br> Uh, she lives in germany, mum. You know.<br> She wanted to have the child at home.<br> - But you'll bring her back here.<br> - Yeah, of course.<br> Well, um, bit of a visit<br> when baby gets big.<br> Rawiri, take miss Parata back to town.<br> Come with me, Pai.<br> When were you gonna tell me?<br> The day you left?<br> I've been trying to tell you<br> since i got here.<br> Look, dad. It's not forever.<br> It's just it's anna's first child, you know?<br> Her work's there,<br> her family.<br> Family?<br> Yeah, i can't expect her to move<br> to the other side of the world.<br> Don't you use that girl as an excuse.<br> You can't wait to get away. I see it in you.<br> You never stay, because it hurts you<br> to see what's happening to us.<br> Yeah, it does.<br> You still walk away from it.<br> Leave that waka of yours out there to rot.<br> I'm not here shoveling shit,<br> but, dad, i'm doing my share.<br> Did you even see my work?<br> Did you... did you even look at it?<br> You call it work.<br> It's not work. It's souvenirs.<br> Those young men you turn your back on...<br> they've got something to learn from you.<br> You've got something to offer.<br> Don't you turn away!<br> Yeah, you've got<br> the privileges...<br> but you forget you've<br> also got the obligations!<br> Look at me, dad, for once in your life.<br> Go on.<br> Ah, you don't even<br> know who i am.<br> I know who you're meant to be,<br> who you were born to be.<br> Oh, yeah, right.<br> But i failed ya, eh, dad?<br> Yeah, because why?<br> I had a daughter?<br> Well, i'm probably gonna have another daughter.<br> And you know what?<br> I'm not gonna let you treat<br> another child of mine like that.<br> Then take her with you! You don't like the job<br> i'm doing, take her! Go on! Take her!<br> - Stop it!<br> - She's no use to me.<br> Pai?<br> No, leave her.<br> I'll get her. Pai!<br> You all right?<br> Gotta watch that koro sometimes.<br> Big mouth of his gets away on him, eh?<br> He didn't mean it...<br> about me.<br> Well...<br> you know, maybe<br> we should think about it.<br> Think about what?<br> You coming to live with me<br> for a while.<br> What do ya think?<br> Why doesn't he want me?<br> Oh, Pai, it's not you.<br> It's not even about you, in a way.<br> Koro is just... he's just looking for something<br> that doesn't exist anymore.<br> A new leader?<br> They exist.<br> Yeah, they do,<br> except i think...<br> it's become<br> even more than that.<br> In his head, your koro,<br> he needs a prophet.<br> What's that?<br> Well, somebody who's gonna lead our people<br> outta the darkness...<br> and who'll make everything<br> all right again.<br> Only problem is, you can't just decide who those<br> people are just because you want them to be, eh?<br> Like my brother?<br> Yeah.<br> Your koro made himself believe so strongly<br> that he was gonna be the one.<br> But what if he was?<br> And what if he wasn't?<br> You know, your koro,<br> he did the same thing with me.<br> Is that why he's<br> so hard on you?<br> Yep. Pretty much.<br> Because i can't be<br> what he wants, eh?<br> Me neither.<br> You think about it, okay?<br> You know you'd make me really happy<br> if you'd come and stay with me.<br> Mmm.<br> Just think about it.<br> - Ready, Pai?<br> - One more go.<br> You be good<br> to that girl.<br> That's right.<br> You look.<br> I'm gonna need<br> all the firstborn boys.<br> - It's time they learnt.<br> - Learnt what?<br> When she was born,<br> that's when things went wrong for us.<br> That's where we'll find the answer.<br> You all right?<br> Stop the car.<br> Pai?<br> What is it, Pai?<br> Can we go home now?<br> But why? What is it?<br> What's wrong?<br> - I have to go home.<br> - Why?<br> I just have to.<br> I know.<br> It's okay.<br> There are some discussions about the...<br> Paka!<br> I'm back.<br> Not now, Pai.<br> But i'm back.<br> I'm back.<br> Anyway...<br> where does<br> that information come from?<br> It comes from the books.<br> - You shouldn't be smoking.<br> - Tryin' to give up, aren't i?<br> - How come you didn't go with your dad?<br> - I did.<br> Hmm. For one day.<br> I would have gone.<br> When my dad gets out,<br> i'm gonna go with him.<br> - Where?<br> - Wherever. Get outta this dump.<br> Koro's gonna be pissed off<br> when he sees you smoking.<br> No, he won't,<br> 'cause he's not coming.<br> - Is so.<br> - No, he's getting the school ready.<br> What school?<br> For us fellas, to teach us<br> the old ways and that.<br> Probably gonna be stink.<br> - You can come on the bus if you want.<br> - I'm waiting for koro.<br> - But he's not coming.<br> - I said, "i'm waiting."<br> - When you're ready.<br> - When everyone's here, i'll be ready.<br> They are here.<br> Those boys have waited half an hour.<br> You tell her you weren't<br> going to pick her up?<br> She could have come<br> on the bus.<br> You pick her up every day for years<br> and she's just supposed to guess?<br> Good. Let's go.<br> Do the welcome, bub.<br> Go on.<br> What do you think you're doing?<br> Pai.<br> You're a girl.<br> Go to the back.<br> What did i say?<br> What did i say?<br> Then leave.<br> Go on!<br> For you boys, this will be<br> a sacred school of learning.<br> You'll be taught<br> in the old ways...<br> in all the qualities<br> of a chief.<br> You will be tested<br> for your strength...<br> your courage,<br> your intelligence...<br> and your leadership.<br> Paikea's canoe sank...<br> and he called on the ancient ones for strength.<br> You're going to learn that chant.<br> All of you. Learn it exactly.<br> And if you break the chant,<br> you will suffer the utu...<br> the consequences.<br> Like what?<br> Someone dying or something?<br> Like your dick'll drop off.<br> So, hold onto your dicks.<br> Enough. Hold onto your dick.<br> Now, repeat after me.<br> The taiaha is an instrument of war...<br> a tool for fighting.<br> If you want to master it,<br> you've got to show it respect.<br> Hemi. Here.<br> Peh!<br> Pick it up.<br> Good.<br> Be angry.<br> Anger's part of your battle.<br> You gotta learn to control it.<br> Now, take a break.<br> Get a drink of water.<br> The rest of you in pairs.<br> - Koro know you're doing that?<br> - I'm not doing anything.<br> How come you're hiding<br> around here then?<br> Koro's cool, eh?<br> He's teaching us to be warriors, man.<br> Gonna be chiefs.<br> We're gonna smack<br> all those other ones.<br> You shouldn't have hit<br> koro like that.<br> He was all right.<br> He was real patient, eh?<br> - How come he won't let you do it?<br> - Girls aren't allowed.<br> You could sit up the back.<br> Long as you were quiet.

And if the knowledge is given<br> to everyone, we can have lots of leaders.<br> And soon,<br> everyone will be strong...<br> notjust the ones<br> that've been chosen.<br> Because sometimes, even if you're the leader<br> and you need to be strong...<br> you can get tired.<br> Like our ancestor, Paikea,<br> when he was lost at sea...<br> and he couldn't find the land,<br> and he probably wanted to die.<br> But he knew the ancient ones<br> were there for him...<br> so he called out to them<br> to lift him up and give him strength.<br> This is his chant.<br> I dedicate it to my grandfather.<br> - She all right?<br> - She's asleep.<br> That old man know<br> she's staying the night?<br> If he doesn't like it,<br> he can sleep in the road.<br> Might be time for us to leave, eh, dear?<br> What is it?<br> You'd better come<br> have a look.<br> Who is to blame?<br> I called them and they came...<br> but it wasn't right.<br> They were dying.<br> Hey, keep it away from the blowhole, bro.<br> That's it. Just around the edges.<br> You okay?<br> He died.<br> Koro knew what it meant.<br> It was Paikea's whale,<br> sent to us because we were in trouble.<br> Dad?<br> - We've got to turn it around.<br> - How?<br> Get a tractor down here<br> and some ropes.<br> We'll wait for the tide.<br> If... if we can move it,<br> the others will follow.<br> - Get the men.<br> - They're stuffed.<br> Half of them have<br> been up all night.<br> They'll do it for you.<br> It was a test...<br> but for koro this time.<br> Leave it.<br> You've done enough.<br> Now!<br> E pana e!<br> E pana e!<br> He wanted to die.<br> There wasn't a reason<br> to live anymore.<br> It's no use. They're too tired.<br> We'll try again later.<br> Let them rest.<br> - Come on, dear. We'll come back.<br> Come on.<br> It's gone!<br> Where is she?<br> Where's my moko?<br> Where is she?<br> Pai!<br> It's okay, paka.<br> I wasn't scared to die.<br> Hurry up!<br> Hurry!<br> Let's go!<br> Which one?<br> What do you mean, which one?<br> Yes?<br> Thank you, dear.<br> I've been praying to god<br> about it.<br> If that little one wakes up,<br> i'm gonna give up the smokes.<br> She'd like that.<br> Wise leader,<br> forgive me.<br> I am just a fledgling new to flight.<br> My name is Paikea Apirana,<br> and I come from a long line of chiefs...<br> stretching all the way back<br> to the whale rider.<br> I'm not a prophet...<br> but i know that our people<br> will keep going forward...<br> all together,<br> with all of our strength.<br>
