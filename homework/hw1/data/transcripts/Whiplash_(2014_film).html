Isn't it subjective?<br> No.<br> Does the studio get you a job?<br> No it's not an actual studio, it's just the name of the ensemble<br> but yeah it's a big step for my career.<br> Well I'm so glad you figured it out, it's a nasty business I am sure.<br> Oh are you gonna tell them about your game this week?<br> Lived up to your title<br> I scored 93 yard touchdown<br> School record, school record!<br> It's division III.<br> It's Carleton football, it's not even division II, it's division III<br> You got any friends Andy?<br> -No. -Why's that?<br> I don't know, I just never really saw the use.<br> Well, who are you going to play with otherwise?<br> Lennon and McCartney, they were school friends, am I right?<br> Charlie Parker didn't know anybody 'til Joe Jones threw a cymbal at his head.<br> So that's your idea of success, huh?<br> I think being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody's idea of success.<br> Dying broke and drunk and full of heroin at the age of 34 is not exactly my idea of success.<br> I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me<br> than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I was.<br> Ah, but your friends will remember you, that's the point.<br> None of us were friends with Charlie Parker. That's the point.<br> Travis and Dustin? They have plenty of friends and plenty of purpose.<br> I'm sure they'll make great school board presidents someday.<br> Oh, that's what this is all about? You think you're better than us?<br> You catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?<br> I got a reply for you, Andrew. You think Carleton football's a joke?<br> Come play with us.<br> Four words you will never hear from the NFL.<br> Who wants dessert?<br> And from Lincoln Center?<br> Alright guys, get out of here.<br> Pick up the new chart by the door on your way out.<br> Rehearsal 9PM sharp tonight, that's how long you have till then to learn it.<br> Neyman, just come over here.<br> See the tempo marking on there?<br> Quarter note equals 330<br> That is a double-time swing.<br> That's what got you in here right?<br> Oh yeah.<br> I recently stumbled across another kid<br> In the practice room working on his double time swing.<br> So I'm gonna give him another shot.<br> Am I late?<br> Perfect timing.<br> Come on in Connelly<br> You two know each other right?<br> Yeah, yeah, Nassau band.<br> Hey, what's up Andrew.<br> Now Connelly I've made Neyman a temporary core.<br> But with this competition coming up I just wannna make very sure this chart's in the best shape it can be.<br> Yeah it's the one right here right?<br> I gave Connelly the chart this morning.<br> All you need to do now is to just give both of you a crack at it, alright?<br> So Neyman go ahead jump on the kit we'll take it from the top.<br> Ok.<br> I don't want you to worry about the hits right now, just tempo.<br> Ok?<br> All set?<br> Not quite my tempo.<br> -Connelly? -Ok, I'll take.. from the top.<br> -I can do... -No, we'll go with Connelly now.<br> Hey do you mind?<br> -Ok? -Yeah<br> Perfect Connelly<br> See this to me is the beauty of Studio Band.<br> You walk in here an alternate, who knows you could be the new core.<br> Oh my god, are you serious?<br> That shit?<br> Fletcher.<br> Thanks man.<br> Don't worry about Fletcher, he's more bark than bite.<br> -Hey look, I can play these charts. -Now's not the time.<br> -I can play. -I said not now!<br> If you want the fucking part, earn it.<br> I'm just gonna lay it out there.<br> This is why I don't think that we shouldn't be together.<br> And I thought about it a lot.<br> And this is what's gonna happen, ok?<br> I'm gonna keep pursuing what I'm pursuing<br> And because I'm doing that it's gonna take more and more of my time<br> And I'm not gonna be able to spend so much time with you.<br> And when I do spend time with you, I'll be thinking about drumming.<br> I'll be thinking about Jazz and my charts and all that.<br> And because of that you're gonna start to resent me.<br> And you're gonna tell me to ease up drumming, spend more time with you<br> because you're not feeling importrant<br> And I'm not gonna be able to do that.<br> And I'll just start to resent you for even asking me to stop drumming.<br> And we'll just start to hate each other.<br> And it's gonna get very... it's gonna be ugly.<br> And so... for those reasons, I'd rather just break it off clean.<br> Cuz I wanna be great.<br> And you're not?<br> I wanna be one of the greats.<br> And I'll stop you from doing that?<br> Yeah.<br> You know I'll stop you from doing that. You know that for a fact.<br> Yes.<br> And I barely see you anyway<br> -Yeah -And when I did see you you treated me like shit<br> because I'm just some girl who doesn't know what she wants<br> And you have a path, and you're going to be great, and I'm gonna be forgotten<br> And therefore, you won't be able to give me the time and day<br> because you have bigger things to pursue.<br> That's exactly my point.<br> What the fuck is wrong with you?<br> You're right, we should not be dating.<br> I'm ok, thanks.<br> Fuck! Fuck!<br> Fucking piece of shit!<br> Fuck you! Fuck!<br> Sorry we have a new player<br> Ryan Connelly<br> I'm sorry.<br> Can you just... put your instruments down, for a minute?<br> Just listen for a minute.<br> Six years ago<br> I came across a kid in the practice room working on his scales<br> He was early second year<br> and he started in Shaffer with a lot of hope<br> Like all you guys.<br> but the truth was... He barely squeezed in to begin with and..<br> He was really struggling.<br> The faculty were all telling him, maybe this isn't for you.<br> But they didn't see what I saw.<br> That scared, skinny kid,<br> cursing himself because he couldn't get the scales right.<br> I saw a drive in him.<br> And I put him in Studio Band.<br> When he graduated<br> made him the third trumpet in Lincoln Center.<br> A year later he was the first.<br> And that's what you're listening to now.<br> His name was Sean Casey.<br> I found out this morning that... Sean<br> died yesterday.<br> in a car accident.<br> And I just...<br> want you guys to know he was a beautiful player.<br> I just thought you should know.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Ok.<br> Let's get to work, how about...<br> Caravan, bar 105<br> One and two and<br> It's not... not quite right Connelly<br> I'd like to try Neyman on this.<br> Maybe now is the time for Neyman to earn the part<br> One and two and<br> No, I guess not.<br> Tanner<br> One and two and<br> Motherfucker!<br> Connelly get your ass back on the kit<br> We'll stay here for as long as it takes till one of faggots can play in time.<br> One and two and<br> looks like it'll be all night. Neyman.<br> One and two and<br> Not my fucking tempo!<br> Sorry guys, hate to put you through this<br> If you need to fucking take a dump or get a coffee whatever<br> now might be a good time<br> because we're gonna stay here until I find a drummer who can fucking play in time<br> I apologize to the musicians.<br> Seriously, take ten, twenty, a fucking hour<br> You hear me cocksuckers?<br> You better start shitting me perfect 400<br> Connelly get your fucking ass back on the kit<br> This is really the fastest you can play, you worthless himey fuck?<br> No wonder mommy ran out on you. Get off the fucking kit.<br> And here comes Mr. Gay pride of the Upper Western side himself<br> Unfortunately this is not a Bette Midler Concert, we'll not be serving Cosmopolitan and Baked Alaska<br> So just play faster than you give fucking hand jobs, will you please?<br> One two one two<br> Not even fucking close<br> Let's go with the Irish mick fucking paddy-cracker now<br> You... you actually do look quite a bit like a leprechaun<br> I'll start calling you Flannery<br> Get off!<br> What the fuck you looking... there's not a pot of gold down there<br> Oh adjusting the seat, really?!<br> That's been your fucking problem the whole time? The seat height?<br> So now you have it right?<br> Go.<br> Bullshit! Fuck you!<br> Neyman.<br> Maybe, it's time to finally bring this home, what do you say?<br> Show me.<br> Don't slow down!<br> Pick it up!<br> Faster!<br> Faster!<br> Faster!<br> Faster!<br> Keep playing!<br> Keep playing!<br> Keep playing!<br> Neyman<br> You earned the part.<br> Alternates, you wanna clean the blood off my drum set?<br> Ok, we can start now.<br> Give yourself at least two hours to get there from the city this time alright?<br> Save your travel receipts.<br> Or no, I don't give a shit.<br> Excuse me, do you know where the cabs are?<br> -You have to call the cabs. -I konw, they say the cabs suppose to be right here?<br> No you gotta call them, it'll take forever.<br> Ok how do I get the Hardrove?<br> Come on please, come on, you're still open! You're still open!<br> Come on, come on!<br> -Yeah hello? -Where the fuck are you man? Call time is 5<br> I know, I know, I'm almost there. I'm almost there man. I'm right there.<br> -We're on stage in 20 -I know we're on stage in 20<br> -Fletcher got Connelly warming up... -God fucking damnit!<br> You just tell that little fucking redhead I'm gonna be there ok?<br> Fuck<br> Hey, Sorry I'm late.<br> Glad you finished on your busy schedule, darling.<br> I know. Look, I'm sorry, but I'm here man, ready to go.<br> Connelly's playing the part.<br> Like fucking hell he's playing my part.<br> What the fuck did you just say to me?<br> It's my part.<br> It's my part, and I decide who to lend it to.<br> Usually to somebody that has fucking sticks.<br> I left in the car, I'll be right back<br> -Take me 5 minutes. -I'm warming up the band now.<br> -Look I can use Ryan's sticks -Neyman you lost the fucking part<br> No I didn't, look you can't fucking do this to me!<br> -Can't?! -Yeah!<br> When did you become a fucking expert on what I can or cannot do?<br> You fucking weepy-willow shit sack?<br> I earned that part.<br> You never earned anything. God you're a self-righteous prick<br> The only reason you are a fucking core is because you misplaced folder.<br> The only reason you're in Studio Band to begin with is because I told you<br> exactly what I'd be asking for in Nassau<br> -Am I wrong? -Yeah<br> -I'm in Studio Band, cause I'm the.. -Why don't you just back off?!<br> Hey you, fuck off Johnny Utah, turn my pages bitch!<br> Hey, I can cut you any fucking time I want.<br> You wouldn't cut me by now.<br> Try me you fucking weasel!<br> At 5.30, that's exactly 11 minutes, my band is on stage.<br> If your ass is not on that stool with your own fucking sticks in hand<br> Or you make one fucking mistake<br> One<br> I'll drum your ass back to Nassau where you can turn pages untill you graduate or fucking drop off.<br> By the time you are done at Shaffer, you're gonna make daddy look like a fucking successful story<br> Got it?<br> Or, we can let Johnny Utah play the part. You choose.<br> It's my part, I'll be on your stage.<br> Fuck... you got ten minutes you fucking pathetic pansy-ass fruit-fuck<br> -Hey tell Fletcher I'm coming. -What took you so long man, we're moving on stage right now.<br> I know I got locked in my car. It's fine, I'm coming.<br> "Left turn, 200 feet"<br> Are you driving man?<br> -No -What the hell is that noise?<br> Ok look why don't you just tell Fletcher, that I am coming you motherfucker!<br> Are you ok?<br> -Are you ok? -Yeah I gotta get my sticks.<br> No no no no, stay away from the car.<br> -I'm calling 911, it's ok. -Just a couple more blocks.<br> Sir, you don't have to...<br> Shaffer Conservatory, Studio Band.<br> Neyman, what the fuck?<br> Neyman<br> You're done.<br> Gentlemen and ladies, I apologize on behalf of Shaffer Conservatory.<br> I'm gonna fucking kill you!<br> Get off me!<br> Fuck you!<br> Fuck you Fletcher Fuck you!<br> You fuck... piece of shit!<br> Fuck you!<br> When did you start talking to her?<br> Your father got contacted this week.<br> Does the name Sean Casey mean anything to you?<br> Do you know about his death?<br> Last month he hung himself in his apartment.<br> What's that have to do with me?<br> Sean suffered from anxiety and depression.<br> His mother claimed this started during his time as Fletcher's student.<br> Now Caseys aren't wealthy, they don't wanna file suit<br> So... what do they want?<br> To make sure that Terrance Fletcher's never allowed to do this to another student<br> He didn't do anything.<br> What's wrong with you? It's over ok?<br> He's out of your life, why would you let him get away with what he did to you?<br> Would you characterize his conduct as extreme Andrew?<br> Did he ever intentionally inflict emotional distress?<br> This will not be a public hearing, you know?<br> Fletcher will never know it was you who spoke up.<br> Why would you do this to me?<br> Do you think that I would let him put my son through hell<br> And just walk away scot-free?<br> Don't you know I would never let that happen?<br> That there is nothing in the world more important to me than you?<br> Don't you know that?<br> Andrew?<br> Andrew?<br> Just tell me what to say.<br> -Hi, and... I loaded your pantry with Gushers. -I saw that.<br> Thanks<br> Andrew<br> Hey<br> Don't know if you heard...<br> I'm not in Shaffer any more.<br> Yeah I did hear that.<br> Did you quit?<br> Not exactly.<br> Some parents got a kid from Sean Casey's year I think<br> to say somethings about me.<br> Although why anybody would have anything other than peaches and cream to say about me is a mystery.<br> That's a good laugh right?<br> -I'm sorry. -No I get it.<br> I know I've made enemies.<br> I'm conducting though<br> They brought back JVC fest this year<br> They got me opening in a couple of weeks with a pro band.<br> That's great.<br> It's alright.<br> Truth is, I don't think people...<br> understood what it was I was doing at Shaffer.<br> I wasn't there to conduct.<br> Any fucking moron can wave his arms and keep people in tempo.<br> I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them<br> I believe that is...<br> an absolute necessity.<br> otherwise we're depriving the world the next Louie Armstrong<br> the next Charlie Parker.<br> I told that story about how Charlie Parker became Charlie Parker<br> -Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head. -Exactly.<br> Parker was a young kid. Pretty good on the sax.<br> Gets up to play in the cutting session<br> And he fucks it up.<br> And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.<br> and he's laughed off-stage<br> crie himself to sleep that night, but the next moring, what does he do?<br> he practices.<br> and he practices and he practices, with one goal in mind<br> never to be laughed at again.<br> And a year later he goes back to the Reno.<br> And he steps up on that stage and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard.<br> So imagine if Jones just said.<br> "Well that's ok Charlie"<br> "That was alright, good job."<br> and Charlie thinks to himself<br> "Well, shit, I did a pretty good job."<br> End of story.<br> No bird.<br> That to me is an absolute tragedy.<br> But that's just what the world wants now.<br> People wonder why Jazz is dying<br> I tell you man<br> Every Starbucks' Jazz album just proved my point, really.<br> There are no two words in English language<br> more harmful than "good job".<br> But is there a line?<br> You know maybe... you go to far, you discourage next Charlie Parker from ever becoming Charlie Parker?<br> No man, no.<br> Because the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged.<br> Yeah.<br> The truth is, Andrew<br> I never really had a Charlie Parker.<br> But I tried.<br> I actually fucking tried.<br> And that's more than most people ever do.<br> and I'll never apologize for how I tried.<br> Alright, see you later.<br> Hey Andrew<br> Listen I have no idea how you gonna take this, but...<br> the band I'm leading for JVC<br> The drummer's not cutting it.<br> You understand what I'm saying?<br> -No. -I'm using the Studio Band playlist.<br> Caravan Whiplash<br> I need somebody who really knows these charts.<br> What about Ryan Connelly?<br> Ryan Connelly ever was to me is an incentive for you.<br> Tanner?<br> Tanner switched to premed<br> Guess he got discouraged.<br> Hey, take the weekend, think about it.<br> -Hello? -Hey Nicole, it's Andrew.<br> -Hi -Hey<br> Been a while since...<br> I talked to you<br> Look...<br> I'm really sorry<br> about everything, that's not.. not but.. I'm just<br> really sorry.<br> But anyway I got... I actually have this show this weekend<br> It's a... JVC thing, I don't know maybe if you wanna go<br> it's in Carnegie Hall and.. we.. maybe get some like.. pizza afterwards<br> like.. complain about our schools.. again.<br> What... is that JV?<br> No it's JVC, it's like a.. it's Jazz... thing.<br> Ugh... I don't know if I can come.<br> I have to check with my boyfriend.<br> Ok<br> Yeah<br> I'll check, but I don't know that... he's into Jazz, so...<br> Yeah I mean, not for everybody.<br> Ok, well I guess maybe I'll see you guys there.<br> Ok.<br> Ok, bye.<br> Alright gangs, listen up.<br> Now for those of you who are new with this<br> which looks like might be everybody except Karl<br> Tonight can change your life.<br> The folks out there make a phone call<br> You can be a blue note signee<br> An EMC client<br> A Lincoln Center core<br> On the other hand, if you drop the ball<br> you might be looking for a new line of work because<br> the other thing about these cats is<br> they never forget.<br> We all set?<br> Alright, let's have fun.<br> You think I'm fucking stupid?<br> What?<br> I know it was you.<br> Thank you ladies and gentlemen<br> We're very excited to be here kicking off the JVC festival this year<br> I'm Terrance Fletcher, and these are some of the best musicans in New York<br> which means some of the best musicians in the world.<br> And we're gonna do some old standard for you but first<br> we're gonna start out with a new tone By Tim Simonec<br> called Upswinging<br> What the fuck are you doing?!<br> Come on!<br> Yeah I guess maybe you don't have it.<br> Come on, let's go home.<br> What are you doing?<br> I'll cue you in!<br> Caravan.<br> Three Four!<br> "FUCK YOU!"<br> I'll gouge out your motherfucking eye.<br> Andrew what're you doing man?<br> I'll cue you!<br> Hasan Imam, demoniac.axiom@aol.com<br>
