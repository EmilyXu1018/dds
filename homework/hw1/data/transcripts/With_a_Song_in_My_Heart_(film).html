Taxi!<br> Of course, if you'd take<br> my advice and get married...<br> you wouldn't have to worry<br> about where you're gonna eat.<br> We could just go home and eat.<br> - Please, let's not go into that again, not tonight.<br> - I'm sorry.

I've never been here.<br> We're right on schedule.<br> - What time is it?<br> - 6:44, Lisbon time.<br> Oh, my goodness.<br> I'm in the wrong seat.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> I'll take yours.<br> But that nice young man, Mr. Burn,<br> told us to occupy the same seat.<br> What possible difference can it make whether<br> Jane Froman sits there or Jennifer March?<br> - To them, we're just seat numbers anyhow.<br> - Yes, I guess you're right.<br> But I can't imagine<br> what I was thinking of.<br> [No Audible Dialogue]<br> [No Audible Dialogue]<br> - [Explosion]<br> - [Screaming]<br> [Air Raid Siren Wailing]<br> [Speaking Portuguese]<br> [Sirens Wailing]<br> [Chattering]<br> [Man]<br> Nurse? Nurse?<br> [Latin]<br> Hey, nurse.<br> Will somebody stop this babble<br> long enough to tell me what shape I'm in?<br> Do I need an aspirin<br> or an operation?<br> Nurse? Nurse?<br> - How many have been brought in?<br> - [Portuguese]<br> I thought I heard<br> somebody say 15.<br> Fifteen out of 39.<br> I want to know how many.<br> [Portuguese]<br> [People Chattering In Portuguese]<br> Could I have some water?<br> Water, somebody?<br> How do you say...<br> Water? Agua?<br> Doesn't anybody around here<br> speak English?<br> Take it easy, kid. You'll get water<br> when the doctor says so and not before.<br> - You're an American.<br> - And what's wrong with that?<br> You keep still till<br> the doctor gets finished.<br> - Is it bad?<br> - You'll be all right.<br> I'm supposed to be in London.<br> Will I be able to sing?<br> Like a nightingale<br> in Berkeley Square.<br> Put this under your tongue.<br> Nurse, can you find out if a girl by the name<br> of Jennifer March has been brought in?<br> Listen. Will you stop worrying about<br> who's here and who isn't.<br> Leave that to St. Christopher or whose-ever<br> business it is to take care of those things.<br> And you keep this thermometer<br> under your tongue.<br> [Man Speaking Portuguese]<br> [Portuguese]<br> Senora, do you wish the truth?<br> Your right leg is almost severed<br> below the knee.<br> It's a compound fracture.<br> There are also three broken ribs<br> and a crushed left ankle.<br> It may be necessary<br> to amputate your right leg.<br> If you do decide to amputate,<br> would you please tell me first?<br> I will tell you.<br> - Get her ready for surgery immediately.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> What were they saying about him?<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing at all.<br> Just a lot of<br> Portuguese double-talk.<br> They don't think<br> he has much chance, do they?<br> Where'd you get that idea?<br> He's fine.<br> The doctor was saying it would be just<br> a waste of time to operate, wasn't he?<br> Wasn't he?<br> Look. They'll operate, and they'll save him.<br> I don't care what they say.<br> Or I'll burn this joint down.<br> All right, boys, she's all yours.<br> Take it easy.<br> Watch her leg now.<br> Good luck.<br> [Nurse Narrating] Now, don't ask me<br> how we did it, but we pulled them through.<br> All 15 survivors,<br> including John Burn.<br> Of course it was touch and go<br> for some of them these past weeks...<br> but we did it.<br> Unfortunately, Jennifer March, who had<br> changed seats with Jane for that one landing...<br> wasn't one of them.<br> Don't ask me how or why<br> things like that happen either.<br> Any more than why,<br> when they raised the plane...<br> the only thing of Janes<br> they recovered...<br> was this little gold cross<br> which had been given to her...<br> by a kid from Syracuse<br> she'd never even seen.<br> On the other hand, if you're interested<br> in such things as courage and morale...<br> drop around with a bottle of scotch<br> some afternoon when I'm off duty...<br> and I'll be glad<br> to grant you an interview.<br> Because on that subject,<br> I am now an authority.<br> [John]<br> Mmm. Oh, boy.<br> Oh, if I could just get<br> a little lower.<br> - Feel good?<br> - Oh, words fail me.<br> Nothing in the world like it.<br> I know.<br> I can stand pain... anything.<br> But to itch and not<br> be able to scratch it...<br> that I can't stand.<br> The man who thought of making these<br> knitting needles out of plastic...<br> so he can go around corners<br> ought to get a D.S.C.<br> D.S.C., my eye.<br> He oughta be canonized.<br> - Ah, Miss Stomach Bump of 1943.<br> - All right.<br> - Open your traps and swallow these down.<br> - Not again.<br> You oughta be grateful I'm not still<br> stickin' you in the caboose with a needle.<br> - Here you are.<br> - [John] Thank you.<br> [Gasps]<br> Mercy me! If it isn't a reptile!<br> - How'd this get in here?<br> - Why, I haven't the slightest idea.<br> - Go on. Drink it.<br> - Me? Drink that?<br> - Down the hatch.<br> - What are you trying to do, poison me?<br> - It's a tempting idea.<br> - General, you ought to be ashamed of yourself...<br> scaring a poor angel<br> of mercy like Clancy.<br> Listen. You couldn't scare<br> this Flatbush Florence Nightingale...<br> - with Rommel's whole Africa Corps.<br> - Is that so?<br> Well, for that crack you're going to eat<br> intravenously from now on.<br> Wait a minute, Clancy. There's something<br> I've been wanting to ask you.<br> First of all, how did you ever<br> get to be a nurse?<br> Second, what are<br> you doing over here?<br> Question one:<br> I was hit over the head...<br> with a pair<br> of forceps at birth...<br> and when I came to,<br> I was in uniform.<br> Question two:<br> When the war broke out...<br> I joined an ambulance corps<br> from Flatbush to get away from my relatives.<br> - Does that answer you?<br> - Right on the nose.<br> Okay. Here we go,<br> General Pershing.<br> Hey! Give us back our frog.<br> Ask the mother superior for it.<br> - She's gonna find it in her bed tomorrow morning.<br> - [Jane Laughing]<br> - Don't you just love her?<br> - I'm crazy about her.<br> I'd probably elope with her<br> if I weren't already in love with you.<br> Oh, stop it.<br> I mean it, Jane.<br> I had no right to say that, did I?<br> No.<br> Even though it's true?<br> I know you're not happy<br> the way things have been.<br> - [Door Opens]<br> - Good morning.<br> Oh, good morning, Father.<br> - How are you feeling today?<br> - Very well, thank you.<br> Good.<br> [Door Closes]<br> Shall I go on?<br> Or have I already said too much?<br> I admit there's a bond between us.<br> That's only natural<br> after all we've been through.<br> And then being here together<br> every day since the accident...<br> It's more than that.<br> You know it.<br> Ever since that first night,<br> we've clung to each other.<br> We've depended on each other.<br> Maybe that's because<br> we like the same things...<br> the same books, the same music.<br> Jane, people can't go through<br> what we've been through...<br> and then go right on acting<br> as if nothing had happened.<br> [Door Opens]<br> - Pardon me, but somebody's got company.<br> - Hi.<br> - Don!<br> - Remember me?<br> - Where in the world...<br> - Flew over. How else? F.D.R. Gave us a priority.<br> Wants me to bring you on home.<br> Let me look at you. I didn't know<br> what to expect, a crack-up like that...<br> - but you look swell.<br> - Well, I'm all right.<br> They tell me you're gonna be fine.<br> Maybe a little operation or two on the leg...<br> but at least<br> everything's under control.<br> That's what they tell me too.<br> I hope they're right.<br> Don, this is Mr. Burn.<br> John, my husband, Don Ross.<br> - Oh, so youre John Burn,<br> one of the pilots. How are you?<br> - Very well, thank you.<br> And this is Clancy. Miss Clancy.<br> - We met.<br> - Yes, in the room.<br> Look. I've got passage for us...<br> on a Portuguese steamer<br> sailing next Tuesday.<br> It may be a little rugged, but I want to get<br> you home where we can really take care of you.<br> - Think you can make it?<br> - We'll make it.<br> Clancy! You'll go with us?<br> Remember those relatives<br> I was telling you about?<br> I just got a wire.<br> Two of them have been drafted.<br> They're just as likely<br> to show up even here.<br> So it's back to Flatbush for me.<br> - You ready to go to your room?<br> - Uh, yes, please.<br> Why don't you<br> come with us, Mr. Burn?<br> - I think I can fix it.<br> - Thanks. I'll wait and fly back.<br> But, John,<br> I thought you said we'd...<br> Sorry, l...<br> It's nice to have met you, Mr. Ross.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Glad to have met you.<br> - See you later.<br> - You bet.<br> - Seems like a nice guy.<br> - He is.<br> - Hurt bad?<br> - His back... a couple of fractured vertebrae.<br> Tell me, did you have<br> a nice flight over?<br> Yeah. Yeah, sure. Just a breeze.<br> Not a bump all the way.<br> [Don Narrating]<br> And then home sweet home...<br> through submarine infested waters<br> and straight into another hospital.<br> They'd done their best<br> for her in Lisbon.<br> But now she needed<br> more than the best.<br> She needed a miracle.<br> Oh, excuse me, Doctor.<br> I didn't know you were here.<br> - That's all right, Sister.<br> - I can come back later.<br> No, no. Come in.<br> - Aren't they lovely?<br> - [Jane] Beautiful.<br> Wouldn't you like one<br> for your lapel, Doctor?<br> - May I?<br> - All doctors should wear roses in their lapels.<br> Then maybe they wouldn't look<br> so serious and so infallible.<br> Also prettier.<br> I'll take those, Sister.<br> Thank you.<br> You must have a rich admirer.<br> Anybody I know?<br> - John Burn.<br> - Burn? He sent those all the way from Lisbon?<br> Well, he arrived<br> in New York this morning.<br> Pretty quick work.<br> Well, Doctor?<br> Am I still photogenic?<br> It's a beautiful picture, but I'm afraid<br> it's not such a pretty break.<br> That bone's not knitting<br> the way it should.<br> What are we gonna do about it?<br> I know. Let's send it out<br> to Max Factor in Hollywood.<br> He makes over old faces.<br> Maybe he can make over an old leg.<br> [Chuckling]<br> Well, that's a possibility.<br> In the meanwhile,<br> I would say a bone graft is indicated.<br> And that's a very delicate operation.<br> I can't guarantee success.<br> What percentage of such operations<br> are successful, Doctor?<br> Oh, between 50% and 60%.<br> A great deal depends on the patient.<br> A good patient, one with a lot<br> of desire to get well...<br> can make a bad doctor<br> look awfully good.<br> - Are you a good patient?<br> - Terrible. I'll probably kick and howl.<br> - When will you operate?<br> - Personally, I would say the sooner the better.<br> What would you say<br> about tomorrow?<br> Well, I was booked to ride<br> in the fourth at Belmont tomorrow.<br> - You can always be scratched.<br> - Then see that I am, Clancy.<br> No use our keeping the doctor on pins<br> and needles any longer than we have to.<br> Will you come with me, Mr. Ross? I want<br> to show these to Dr. Jameson, my associate.<br> - I'd like you to be present.<br> - Of course.<br> Take it easy.<br> I'll be right back.<br> They're gonna<br> take my leg off, Clancy.<br> Who said so?<br> He didn't have to say so.<br> I know.<br> Ah, you don't want<br> to pay any attention to doctors.<br> They gotta view with alarm,<br> so that later they can point with pride.<br> You know?<br> Like... Like politicians.<br> [Phone Ringing]<br> I'll get it.<br> Hello?<br> Well, welcome home.<br> [Chuckling]<br> Sure, I'm true to you. Wait a minute.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Don't be so nosy. Here.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hi.<br> John! Where are you?<br> Doctor's Hospital.<br> I'm in the X-ray room trying to find out<br> when they're gonna take this crate off me...<br> after which, in case<br> you didn't suspect it...<br> I'm gonna beat a path<br> right straight to your door.<br> What do you know about that?<br> Well, l... I'm not gonna be able<br> to see anybody for a while.<br> Well, how are you?<br> How was everything in Lisbon when you left?<br> Don't change the subject.<br> You have missed me, haven't you?<br> Never mind. Don't answer that.<br> I just wanted to hear your voice.<br> - All ready, Mr. Burn.<br> - Okay.<br> Sorry. I gotta run now. They want me<br> to pose again. But I'll be seeing you.<br> Oh! Tell Clancy I love her too.<br> Good-bye.<br> Here you are. Thank you.<br> - You gonna see him?<br> - If he wants to come.<br> Is that wise?<br> No, I suppose it isn't, but...<br> [Crying]<br> Oh, Clancy, what am I going to do?<br> There, there.<br> None of that now.<br> I've never known anyone like him.<br> When he's with me,<br> I don't even hurt as much.<br> I've learned to lean on him so.<br> I know. I know.<br> I don't want to hurt Don.<br> But, Clancy, I'm in love.<br> For the first time in my life,<br> I'm really in love.<br> I've tried not to think about him.<br> I keep telling myself<br> that nothing can come of it.<br> But I need him...<br> and I want to see him.<br> [Crying]<br> What should I do?<br> Well...<br> The first thing you should do<br> is blow your nose and powder it...<br> before somebody<br> comes back in here.<br> Here. Use this.<br> Now this is no time to get yourself<br> all worked up emotionally...<br> and start acting like a female.<br> When you're through with all this,<br> you'll have plenty of time to decide.<br> But right now,<br> let's do what the doctor said.<br> Give him a break. Right?<br> That's my girl.<br> [Groans]<br> [Slurring]<br> Clancy.<br> I'm here, honey.<br> Now you go back to sleep.<br> Rest is what you need.<br> - Clancy?<br> - How you feel?<br> Still a little woozy?<br> [Slurring, Indistinct]<br> Don't worry, kid.<br> It's still there.<br> Sister Marie! A piano?<br> Yes, Sister.<br> It's for Miss Froman.<br> She's going to rehearse<br> for a new show.<br> Rehearse? In her condition?<br> Why, she can't even walk.<br> Dr. Taylor considers work<br> a very good therapy, Sister.<br> Also, Miss Clancy says<br> she can use...<br> I hope you'll pardon<br> the expression, Sister...<br> but Miss Clancy says she<br> can also use a few "bucks."<br> Excuse me, Sister,<br> they're waiting for us now.<br> - [Knocking]<br> - [Clancy] Come in.<br> Well, here we are.<br> Where would you like it?<br> Uh, right over here I think.<br> That oughta do right there.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I'll take care of that.<br> Thank you, fellas.<br> Thank you, Sister.<br> We'll try to be as quiet as we can.<br> Don't worry about the noise.<br> That heart case next door has gone home.<br> - You won't disturb a soul.<br> - Good.<br> Oh, I don't suppose you'd want<br> any outsiders to hear you rehearse?<br> Well, I guess our secret will be safe with you,<br> Sister. Stick around if you want.<br> May I? Oh, thank you.<br> I'm so crazy about music.<br> I promise to be as still as a mouse.<br> It's all right.<br> Glad to have you.<br> First I'm gonna play<br> your theme song.<br> This comes right after the opening number<br> when the artists come on.<br> As the curtains part,<br> you're sitting there...<br> better still, standing... if we can figure<br> some way to prop you up.<br> You're posing for this artist, the tenor...<br> That's you, Clancy.<br> Well, that's typecasting, all right.<br> [Don]<br> As it happens, you're nuts about Jane...<br> but there are reasons<br> why you can't tell her so yet.<br> I know one good reason.<br> I ain't a boy.<br> Well, he walks over to you,<br> and you have a few lines of dialogue.<br> You know, love stuff. You say, uh,<br> "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."<br> And then, Clancy, you say,<br> "Blah, blah, blah, blah..."<br> Who wrote this, Eugene O'Neill?<br> [Don]<br> After which, you go into your song.<br> I'll play it for you.<br> But before I play that...<br> I want to do the opening for you<br> so you can picture the whole scene.<br> First we bring<br> the artists on like this.<br> % Montparnasse%<br> % We are the artists<br> of the Montparnasse%<br> % And though our paintings<br> are comme ci comme ca%<br> % What do we care%<br> % Ooh, la, la%<br> % We love to share our<br> savoir-faire in Montparnasse%<br> Right here we bring<br> the chorus on, the models.<br> That's you, Sister.

Oh, I'm sorry, Sister.<br> I didn't mean to offend you. L...<br> Oh, I'm not offended<br> in the least.<br> Yeah, but l... You see, I sort of<br> got carried away in it.<br> - Let me get you a chair.<br> - You mean you're not gonna use me anymore?<br> Well, after all, Sister,<br> this is a bunch of chorus girls.<br> But it's the first time<br> I've ever been in a chorus.<br> And if I have to go back and tell the other sisters<br> I was fired, they'd never forgive me.<br> - But I couldn't ask you...<br> - Let me do it, Sister. I'm more the type.<br> - You can be the tenor.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Okay, professor.<br> Let's go. Swing it.<br> % Montparnasse%<br> % We are the models and we pose... % %<br> % % [Orchestral "Montparnasse'"]<br> [Clancy Narrating]<br> I'm here to tell the cockeyed world...<br> stage history<br> was made that night.<br> To be perfectly frank,<br> none of us knew what to expect.<br> Here was a girl<br> with a 35-pound cast on her leg...<br> who'd have to be carried on and off<br> the stage 22 times a performance...<br> making her first public appearance<br> since the accident.<br> The big question<br> in all our minds was...<br> would the audience<br> take her this way?<br> More important still,<br> could she stand the gaff?<br> There you are, honey.<br> - [Grunts]<br> - [Gasps]<br> - [Clancy] What'd you do? Are you hurt?<br> - No, I'm all right.<br> - What happened?<br> - I just dropped my handkerchief.<br> Watch your leg.<br> You know better than to lean over like that.<br> I wouldn't have caused this much excitement<br> if I'd ridden in on a horse like Lady Godiva.<br> - That's a good act too,<br> but your hair ain't long enough.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - All right. Then clear. Clear the stage.<br> % % [Finale]<br> - Gee, I hope she's...<br> - Don't worry. She'll be fine.<br> % % [Orchestra Swells]<br> [Clancy Narrating]<br> Well, we had our answer.<br> They still wanted Froman.<br> But even while they were still cheering<br> in Boston, we had to close.<br> That leg had begun to act up again.<br> Now the really rugged days<br> were beginning.<br> Ahead lay long<br> dreary weeks and months...<br> of suffering, of uncertainty,<br> bitterness, despair...<br> more doctors, more consultations,<br> more X-rays, more bone grafts.<br> Seldom if ever out of pain...<br> excruciating pain.<br> Once or twice,<br> near death itself.<br> In and out of a dozen hospitals,<br> always facing another operation.<br> Ten, 20... So many in fact that even I<br> began to lose track of them.<br> Twenty-one, 22...<br> Tumors, abscesses,<br> nervous exhaustion...<br> endless hours with psychiatrists...<br> sometimes not caring<br> whether she lived or died.<br> And always with the threat<br> hanging over her head...<br> that next time that leg<br> would have to come off.<br> Here we are.<br> Mmm. That looks good.<br> [Sniffs]<br> - Smells good too.<br> - Hmm.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - I'm not hungry.<br> None of that now.<br> You've got to eat.<br> Why? Why do I have to eat?<br> I'm sick of it. I'm sick of all of it.<br> Why don't they just go ahead<br> and cut it off and be done with it?<br> They know I'll never walk again.<br> Why don't they admit it?<br> - Who says you'll never walk again?<br> - I do.<br> And I'm fed up with hearing<br> you and everybody else say that I will.<br> I know I'll never be<br> a normal woman again.<br> I'll never dance.<br> I'll never go shopping.<br> I'll never do any of the things<br> other women do.<br> I can't even remember what it was like<br> to wear a decent pair of shoes.<br> So why go on fighting it<br> and kidding myself?<br> I hope they do take it off.<br> I'll be glad to get it over with.<br> Now wait a minute. That's just about<br> enough of that kind of talk.<br> Sure, you've had your share of it.<br> Do you think I've sat around here day<br> after day watching you suffer...<br> without knowing what<br> you've been going through?<br> Why do you think<br> I stayed with you?<br> 'Cause I thought you had it in you to keep on<br> punching without feeling sorry for yourself.<br> But don't you see?<br> I'm tired of punching.<br> I'm tired of fighting.<br> I've had enough. I'm sick of it!<br> You're sick of it?<br> Well, I've got news for you.<br> This has been<br> no picnic for me either.<br> But I said to myself, "This baby's got what<br> it takes.

Yes or no.<br> Me or him?<br> Do we have to decide that tonight?<br> I've got two shows to do.<br> You can't keep putting<br> these things off forever.<br> Well, can't we wait just a few days<br> until I can think more rationally?<br> - % % [Continues]<br> - You wouldn't have to think...<br> if you'd just make up your mind<br> not to see him again.<br> Would that solve anything?<br> Please, Don.<br> All right.<br> But what am I supposed to do?<br> Exit laughing?<br> Don't my feelings count?<br> I know it's a tragic thing that's happening<br> to us, to our marriage...<br> Don't talk as if we'd done something wrong,<br> because we haven't.<br> Okay. But there has to be a showdown<br> sometime, and it might as well be now.<br> - [Jane]John.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Burn. Glad you could make it. How are you?<br> - Fine, thanks.<br> I forgot to tell you. I asked Mr. Burn<br> to have dinner with us tonight.<br> Slide in next to Jane for a minute<br> while I make a phone call.<br> - What'll you have... scotch, cocktail?<br> - Uh, martini, thanks.<br> I'll send the waiter right over with it.<br> Excuse me.<br> - He didn't have to make a phone call.<br> - I know.<br> - He thinks it's time for a showdown.<br> - % % [Ends]<br> [Applause]<br> So do I.<br> - % % [Orchestra Resumes]<br> - What's the answer?<br> I'm not going to see you again.<br> Is...
