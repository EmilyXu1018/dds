I think so.<br> We have tickets to Baltimore.<br> Where is that train, please?<br> It's delayed three hours...<br> you'll hear it announced<br> when it's time to board.<br> - Take a seat right over there.<br> - But I-<br> Just take a seat.<br> I have to wait on these people.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - There?<br> Mama, look, what's that thing?<br> Don't go far, Samuel.<br> Mama?<br> It's over there.<br> Samuel.<br> Hey. man!<br> What the fuck you doing, man?<br> - Washing my hands, man.<br> - What?<br> - Let's get out of here.<br> - Hold tight.<br> I already did that.<br> Just checking again.<br> Move these people back,<br> they shouldn't be this close.<br> Get Schaeffer on the phone,<br> get him down here, now.<br> Right.<br> - Precherd, who found the body?<br> - Right over there, sir.<br> How you doing, pop?<br> You found the body?<br> Not me, daddy, I just reported it.<br> It was the kid.<br> - What kid?<br> - How the hell do I know what kid?<br> It was the kid<br> in the funny black threads. Over there.<br> Thanks, pop.<br> How's he doing?<br> I'm a police officer, ma'am.<br> I have to talk to the boy.<br> What's your name?<br> Samuel.<br> - Samuel Lapp.<br> - And he's your son?<br> We were on our way to Baltimore.<br> My sister is expecting us.<br> Soon our train is leaving.<br> We'll get you on another train.<br> Sam, the man who was killed tonight...<br> was a policeman, and it's my job<br> to find out what happened.<br> I want you to tell me everything you saw<br> when you went in the bathroom.<br> There were two.<br> - There were two men?<br> - I only saw one.<br> Does anybody know about this?<br> No, nobody's had a chance<br> to talk to him.<br> What did he look like?<br> The man that you saw.<br> He was like him.<br> He was a black man?<br> He had black skin?<br> But not schtumpig.<br> Schtumpig? What's schtumpig?<br> On a farm,<br> when a pig is born small like that...<br> he's schtumpig.<br> A runt.<br> So, he wasn't a runt.<br> He was a big guy, like me?<br> Big guy.<br> Subject is armed. He's wanted<br> for the stabbing deaths of a narcotic...<br> I should have been there, John.<br> I told you.<br> That's not the point. That's the risk.<br> Undercover, one mistake,<br> bang, they kill you-<br> Where are you taking us?<br> I'm sorry.<br> We're looking for a suspect.<br> We got reason to believe<br> he's still in the neighbourhood.<br> I want the little boy<br> to take a look at him.<br> You have no right to keep us here.<br> Yes, I do. Your son<br> is a material witness to a homicide.<br> You don't understand.<br> We want nothing to do with your laws.<br> Doesn't surprise me.<br> A lot of people I meet are like that.<br> What did he say?<br> He asked who you are. Your name.<br> I told him we didn't need<br> to know anything about you.<br> Book. John Book.<br> Hey, man, where're you hiding?<br> Have a seat.<br> Young blood, where're you going?<br> Looking good, T-Bone.<br> - Hey, man, how're you doing?<br> - What the fuck?<br> - I'll sue you, man!<br> - Gotta get his arm. Let's get his arm.<br> Is this the man, Sam? Is this him?<br> You sure?<br> - Back off.<br> - You listen to me.<br> I want no further part of this,<br> nor does my son.<br> Okay. Get back in the car.<br> Honest mistake, all right.<br> John, what are we gonna do with them?<br> - What?<br> - A hotel or what?<br> Put them in a hotel,<br> they won't be there in the morning.<br> - I'll have to send to Baltimore for them.<br> - Well, what?<br> I got it.<br> This is my sister, Elaine.<br> This is Mrs Lapp and Samuel.<br> Where do you want them, Elaine?<br> The back bedroom, blue room?<br> Yeah, sure. The blue room.<br> - Can I help you with something?<br> - No.<br> Right back there, Sam. It's in the back.<br> How could you do this to me tonight?<br> It's important.<br> Just keep going straight through,<br> there's a folding cot for your son.<br> He turned on the light, good.<br> I told you I had company.<br> - Where's Jason and Billy?<br> - Upstairs, asleep.<br> You got a man in the house<br> and the kids are upstairs?<br> That's none of your business. So keep<br> your holier-than-thou mouth shut.<br> - Anyway, they like Fred.<br> - Fred? Now we got a Fred.<br> - Who are these orphans, anyway?<br> - They're Amish.<br> - Everything okay?<br> - Yes. Thank you.<br> - John says you're Amish.<br> - Yes.<br> Do we have to stay here?<br> No, we don't. Just for the night.<br> Say Your prayers.<br> - Hi, Captain.<br> - Hi, Bob.<br> When can we leave the city?<br> I'm trying to get this over with<br> as quick as I can, then you can go.<br> Good.<br> Samuel's probably going to have to<br> come back and testify. I'm sorry.<br> No, you're not, you're glad.<br> - Glad?<br> - Because now you have a witness.<br> Yeah, now I got a witness.<br> I just don't like my son spending all<br> his time with a man who carries a gun...<br> - and goes around whacking people.<br> - Whacking?<br> Come here, kiddo.<br> Big guy.<br> Now, don't be frightened. You can<br> see them, but they can't see you.<br> I want the hats and the sunglasses off.<br> Straighten up.<br> I want you to tell me<br> if any of these men...<br> are the man that you saw<br> in the bathroom. Take your time.<br> Look real carefully.<br> Make sure.<br> Are you sure?<br> Okay.<br> Three dogs to stay.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - These, we call Wurst.<br> - Sure.<br> Your sister said you don't have a family.<br> No, I don't.<br> She thinks that you ought to get<br> married and have children of your own...<br> - instead of trying to be a father to hers.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> Except she thinks<br> you're afraid of the responsibility.<br> That's interesting, anything else?<br> Yeah.<br> She said that<br> she thinks that you like policing...<br> because you think<br> you're right about everything...<br> and that you're the only one<br> who can do anything.<br> And that...<br> when you drink a lot of beer,<br> you say things like:<br> "None of the other police know<br> a crook...<br> "from a bag of elbows."<br> I believe that's what she said.<br> Good appetite.<br> Captain.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Sgt Carter for you on Line 23.<br> Thanks.<br> How are you doing?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Little boy.<br> Look, he's shy.<br> Hey! Knock it off.<br> Knock it off!<br> I'll get it.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi, Kathy.<br> Dad!<br> - Hello, Marilyn.<br> - Hi, John.<br> It's McFee, Paul.<br> He's one of them, anyway.<br> Positive ID from the Amish kid.<br> McFee? Lieutenant Narcotics?<br> Right.<br> I hope you don't have<br> any doubt about that.<br> It all fits, Paul. Four years ago...<br> Narcotics runs a raid<br> in which, amongst other things...<br> is confiscated.<br> They put it in Police Storage.<br> Philadelphia supplies all the<br> major cities in the country with speed.<br> They need this P-2-P stuff<br> to make the speed.<br> They pay up to $5,000 a pint for it.<br> I call Police Storage...<br> no record of 1055-gallon drums<br> of P-2-P.<br> That's $22 million, Paul.<br> Guess who ran the raid four years ago?<br> - McFee.<br> - Right.<br> - Have you talked to him about it?<br> - No. On vacation, Florida.<br> All right,<br> what do you need to clean this up?<br> People from outside the department.<br> Put some guys on this McFee,<br> watch him, wait him out.<br> Right. FBI or maybe somebody<br> from Treasury. I'll take care of that.<br> I want maximum security on this.<br> Where's the boy?<br> At my sister's house.<br> He's going to have to be moved.<br> Who else knows about this?<br> - Just you and I.<br> - Let's leave it that way.<br> Twila, get back!<br> Police! Back in the elevator!<br> That's our car!<br> - Get in the elevator!<br> - I don't give a shit.<br> You idiot!<br> Get down!<br> I know you, asshole!<br> - It's John. Says you have to leave now.<br> - What?<br> He says it's urgent. I don't know.<br> Get dressed quickly.<br> John!<br> Put my car in the garage<br> and close the door.<br> John, I don't understand any of this.<br> You don't know anything. Okay?<br> I borrowed your car. All right?<br> I didn't say why.<br> You never heard of that woman<br> and her boy.<br> John, please tell me why.<br> Just do it.<br> You said we would be safe<br> in Philadelphia.<br> Well, I was wrong.<br> Did you deliver the kid's interview<br> to Schaeffer?<br> No.<br> I want all the paperwork<br> on this job disappeared tonight...<br> you understand?<br> John, do you know<br> what you're telling me to do?<br> Just do it, man.<br> I'm going to disappear<br> for a couple of days.<br> John, what's going on, man?<br> What is happening?<br> I'll call you when I can.<br> And, partner, watch your back.<br> Schaeffe's in this thing, too.<br> - Shit!<br> - What're you doing?<br> Working late, man.<br> What's going on?<br> That's it.<br> Hey, Fergie?<br> Told you I hit him.<br> He's in trouble. I want to help him.<br> I want you to help him.<br> - We need to know where he is.<br> - What kind of trouble?<br> It's a departmental matter,<br> you don't have to worry about it.<br> If we can just talk to him,<br> we can straighten it out.<br> - A departmental matter?<br> - Right.<br> You're saying he's involved<br> in something illegal?<br> I'm afraid so.<br> Anybody who knows John<br> knows that's a goddamn lie.<br> Of course it is, Elaine.<br> But as long as there's any doubt...<br> it's better that John<br> should come in and clear his name.<br> It's better you should<br> get off my property.<br> I don't want to have to take you in<br> for questioning.<br> He left with the Amish woman, right?<br> - She say where he is?<br> - I don't think she knows.<br> - What about Carter?<br> - Tight.<br> But I'm working on him.<br> Samuel!<br> Opa.<br> You should rest.<br> I'll make us some coffee.<br> No, I can't stay.<br> Will you be coming back<br> to take Samuel to trial?<br> There isn't going to be any trial.<br> Rachel?<br> What happened? Who was that man?<br> Mama.<br> John?<br> My God,<br> why didn't you get to a hospital?<br> No doctor.<br> Gunshot wound,<br> they have to make a report...<br> and if they make a report, they find me...<br> and if they find me, they find the boy.<br> - Is the English dead?<br> - No.<br> Looks dead.<br> Come.<br> He's upstairs.<br> I feel burning.<br> The bullet entered there...<br> and came out there.<br> There's danger of infection.<br> He's lost a great deal of blood.<br> I'm not a doctor.<br> This man should be treated<br> in a hospital.<br> - There's nothing I can do for him.<br> - No.<br> No. He must stay here.<br> What if he dies?<br> Then the Sheriff will come here.<br> They'll say we broke their laws.<br> But then we must pray that<br> he doesn't die...<br> but if he does, then we must find a way,<br> so no one knows.<br> But, Rachel, this is a man's life.<br> We hold it in our hands.<br> I know that.<br> God help me, I know that, Eli.<br> But I'll tell you if he's found...<br> the people who did this to him<br> will come get Samuel.<br> Then make a poultice.<br> Three parts milk, two parts linseed oil,<br> for the infection.<br> I will send Mary by with some teas<br> I will brew myself.<br> Thank you.<br> Lapp, I'll have to speak with the elders<br> on this matter.<br> As you see fit.<br> You shouldn't.<br> Don't do it.<br> I'll fucking kill you.<br> You asshole.<br> He's the one...<br> John?<br> Are you trying to tell me that there's<br> no way we can locate this woman?<br> We're talking about 20th century<br> law enforcement, Sergeant.<br> Well, there's your problem, Chief.<br> Your Amish man doesn't live...<br> in the 20th century,<br> doesn't think in the 20th century.<br> Chief, if the Amish have taken<br> your man in...<br> I wouldn't want to hang from a rope<br> until you find him.<br> The problem is, about every third<br> Amish man around here is named Lapp.<br> And we've got upwards<br> of 14,000 Amish men around here.<br> - That's just Lancaster County. Over in-<br> - Very interesting, Sergeant...<br> but this is a very important matter.<br> It involves the murder of a police officer.<br> Now, there must be a directory of some<br> sort of these people somewhere.<br> Sure. Tax rolls, voter registration,<br> but tell you right now...<br> I don't have the manpower<br> to send a deputy to every Lapp farm...<br> in Lancaster County<br> to see if they've got your Rachel.<br> Maybe, Sergeant,<br> you could do a little telephoning?<br> Yeah, maybe I could.<br> But since the Amish don't have any<br> telephones, I wouldn't know who to call.<br> Thank you, Sergeant.<br> It's been an education.<br> Who are they?<br> The leadership of our district.<br> They decided to come see you<br> for themselves.<br> Except Stoltzfus.<br> He came the first day.<br> - I think he saved your life.<br> - No, that was not I.<br> - Who else knows I'm here?<br> - No one.<br> How long have I been here?<br> Two days.<br> Rest, Mr Book, that's the ticket.<br> And drink my tea, lots of my tea.<br> Tell him his tea stinks.<br> You can tell him when you're able.<br> We're all very happy<br> that you're going to live, John Book.<br> We didn't know what we were<br> going to do with you if you died.<br> It's not our place<br> to ask how he came to us.<br> He'll leave as soon as he's able.<br> Don't move!<br> What are you doing?<br> Come here.<br> Come here, Samuel. Sit down.<br> This is a loaded gun.<br> This is very dangerous.<br> Never, ever...<br> touch a loaded gun.<br> Now I'm taking the bullets out,<br> now it's safe. Okay?<br> Okay, Mr Book.<br> Look, call me John.<br> I just don't want you to get hurt.<br> I don't mean to yell at you.<br> I just don't want you to get hurt.<br> Look, it's all right for you to look<br> at it now, it's unloaded. It's safe.<br> You want to handle it,<br> you can handle it while I'm here...<br> but that, that's not right.<br> Samuel, wait for me downstairs.<br> John Book, while you're in this house,<br> I insist that you respect our ways.<br> Right.<br> Here, take it.<br> Put it somewhere where it's safe.<br> Where he won't find it.<br> This gun of the hand<br> is for the taking of human life.<br> We believe it is wrong to take life.<br> That is only for God.<br> Many times the wars have come...<br> and people have said to us...<br> you must fight, you must kill.<br> It is the only way to preserve the good.<br> But, Samuel...<br> there is never only one way.<br> Remember that.<br> Would you kill another man?<br> I would only kill a bad man.<br> Only the bad man, I see.<br> And you know these bad men by sight?<br> You are able to look into their hearts<br> and see this badness?<br> I can see what they do.<br> I have seen it.<br> And having seen, you've become<br> one of them.

What?<br> Maybe.<br> Well, what about<br> one of those reporters?<br> Those investigative reporters?<br> No, it's too risky.<br> They'd want to talk to the kid.<br> Listen, I'll make a couple of calls.<br> Let you know when maybe<br> you can come in.<br> - I got to go, take care of yourself.<br> - Yeah. You, too.<br> Here.<br> Don't put them in the peaches.<br> See this stream?<br> It goes to the wheel<br> and it makes the wheel turn around.<br> And then it goes, it makes...<br> this wire pump the pump...<br> over there, into the well...<br> and the well's water<br> goes into the house.<br> Yeah?<br> This place really echoes.<br> Hello!<br> - What's up there?<br> - Corn.<br> Would you like to hold my kitten?<br> I'll show you how to do a back rub<br> on him.<br> You hold them like that.<br> You push their head back,<br> and you start rubbing the neck.<br> Is that you, Book?<br> What you doing there?<br> Just trying to get the car started,<br> the battery.<br> If you are well enough to do that...<br> - you can do work for me.<br> - Yeah, what can I do?<br> - Milking, maybe.<br> - Milking'?<br> Cows, you know.

Daniel Hochleitner.<br> How do you do?<br> You look plain, Book.

Maybe not yet.<br> But, Rachel, it does not look...<br> You know there has been talk.<br> Talk about going to the Bishop<br> and having you shunned.<br> That is idle talk.<br> Do not take it lightly.
