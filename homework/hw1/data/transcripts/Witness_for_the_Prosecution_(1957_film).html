                        Silence. Be upstanding in court.<br> All persons who have<br> anything to do before my lords,<br> the queen's justices of oyer and terminer<br> and general jail delivery<br> for the jurisdiction<br> of the Central Criminal Court<br> draw near and give your attendance.<br> God save the queen.<br> What a beautiful day. I've been hoping<br> for a bit of sun for our homecoming.<br> It's worth having the fog just to appreciate<br> the sunshine. Is there a draught?<br> - Shall I roll up the window?<br> - Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.<br> If I'd known how much you talked<br> I'd never have come out of my coma.<br> - This thing weighs a ton.<br> - Now, now.<br> We've been flat on our back<br> for two months, we'd better be careful.<br> Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely<br> to live and work in the Inns of Court.<br> How lucky you lawyers are.<br> I almost married a lawyer.<br> I was in attendance for his appendectomy<br> and we became engaged<br> as soon as he could sit up.<br> And then peritonitis set in<br> and he went like that.<br> He certainly was a lucky lawyer.<br> Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember<br> we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.<br> Oh, shut up!<br> Williams, my cane.<br> Here he comes!<br> Good afternoon. Thank you very much.<br> Everybody back to work.<br> Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like<br> to read you a poem to welcome you back.<br> Very touching. You can recite it<br> after office hours in your own time.<br> Now back to work.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Nothing. I'm just happy<br> that you're your old self again.<br> Any more sentimentality around here,<br> I shall go back to the hospital!<br> They won't take him back.<br> He wasn't really discharged, you know,<br> he was expelled for conduct<br> unbecoming a cardiac patient.<br> Put these in water, blabbermouth!<br> Come on in, Carter.<br> Look at this room.<br> It's ugly, old and musty.<br> But I never knew<br> I could miss anything so much.<br> - Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.<br> - Oh, thank you, sir.<br> I'm not a religious man, but when they<br> carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.<br> - Why, thank you, Carter.<br> - Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.<br> If anything happened to you,<br> what would happen to me, after 37 years?<br> Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October<br> The chemist accused of putting<br> cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.<br> My first murder trial.<br> I was more frightened than the defendant.<br> First time I rose to make an objection,<br> my wig fell off. Where's my wig?<br> Right here.<br> - I've guarded it with me life.<br> - I hope it still fits.<br> I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.<br> Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.<br> What's all this?<br> - We've put it in mothballs.<br> - Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?<br> Of course. The solicitors<br> have been breaking down our doors.<br> - I've got some interesting briefs for you.<br> - That's better.<br> Divorce case, a tax appeal,<br> and an important marine insurance claim.<br> - Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.<br> - No, Carter.<br> I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake<br> any criminal cases. Your doctors have...<br> Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol,<br> tobacco, female companionship.<br> If only they'd let me do<br> something worthwhile!<br> Sorry, sir.<br> Might as well get a bigger box,<br> more mothballs, put me away too.<br> - 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!<br> - Oh, get out!<br> Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now,<br> get undressed and lie down.<br> - We? What a nauseating prospect.<br> - Upstairs, please.<br> Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,<br> I seriously considered strangling you<br> with one of your own rubber tubes.<br> I would then have admitted the crime,<br> retained myself for the defence.<br> My lord, members of the jury, I hereby<br> enter a plea of justifiable homicide.<br> For four months this alleged<br> angel of mercy has pored, probed,<br> punctured, pillaged and plundered<br> my helpless body<br> while tormenting my mind<br> with a steady drip of baby talk.<br> Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.<br> Take your hands off me,<br> or I'll strike you with my cane.<br> - You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.<br> - What cigars?<br> - The ones you're smuggling in your cane.<br> - Cane?<br> You could be jailed for this.<br> You had no search warrant.<br> In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy<br> all over the place.<br> We called him Wilfrid the fox.<br> - I'm confiscating these.<br> - Can't I have just one?<br> No. Upstairs.<br> A few puffs after meals? Please.<br> I'll do it. Some dark night when her back<br> is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer<br> and plunge it between<br> her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.<br> Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've<br> installed something for you here. It's a lift.<br> A lift? I'm sick of this plot<br> to make me a helpless invalid.<br> I think it's a splendid idea.<br> Let's try it, shall we?<br> Out of there. I'll try it.<br> It's my lift because it was my heart attack.<br> Here you are. Simply press this button<br> for up and this one for down.<br> Carter, I warn you,<br> if this contraption should collapse,<br> if the barrister<br> should fall off the bannister...<br> Remarkable.<br> Smoothest flight I've had in years.<br> - Upsy-daisy!<br> - Once more to get the feel of the controls.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?<br> I didn't make an appointment,<br> but this is urgent.<br> If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're<br> full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.<br> I'm sure he'll want this brief.<br> Serious criminal matter.<br> Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.<br> Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.<br> He can't accept anything<br> of an overstimulating nature.<br> Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.<br> Hello, Mayhew.<br> Hello. Distressing news about your health.<br> It's tragic. You'd better get<br> a man with younger arteries.<br> If you could just give us a few minutes.<br> This is Mr Leonard Vole.<br> - He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.<br> - How do you do, Mr Vole?<br> Well, according to Mr Mayhew,<br> I'm not doing at all well.<br> Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!<br> - You're dawdling again!<br> - Oh, shut up!<br> Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when<br> you've something not too stimulating.<br> Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.<br> I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but<br> I quite understand. Take care of yourself.<br> Mayhew! Mayhew!<br> Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.<br> Don't worry, we won't take the brief,<br> but an old friend needs help.<br> Surely I can give him a word of advice.<br> Come on, I'll give you five minutes.<br> No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.<br> Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!<br> You go ahead. Start it without me.<br> This is your fault.<br> You should not have permitted it.<br> It is not my fault. I distinctly told<br> Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.<br> Well, if it's anyone's fault,<br> I expect it's mine.<br> Seems silly to me,<br> but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.<br> - He thinks I may be arrested any minute.<br> - Arrested for what?<br> Well, for murder.<br> Oh!<br> It's the case of Emily French.<br> You've probably seen reports in the press.<br> Middle-aged widow, well-off,<br> living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.<br> Mr Vole had been with her earlier.<br> When the housekeeper returned,<br> she found her dead,<br> struck on the back of the head<br> and killed.<br> Vole seems caught<br> in a web of circumstantial evidence.<br> Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd<br> suggest the strongest line of defence.<br> - I'd probably think better with a cigar.<br> - Of course.<br> No previous convictions. He's of good<br> character with an excellent war record.<br> - You'd like him a lot.<br> - They've confiscated the matches. A light.<br> The defence may turn on establishing<br> an alibi for the night of the murder.<br> - I haven't got any. Let me get you some.<br> - Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.<br> This will take all our cunning.<br> Young man!<br> Come here, please.<br> Your solicitor and I feel you may be able<br> to enlighten me on an important point.<br> - Yes. Thank you.<br> - Sir Wilfrid!<br> You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!<br> - Give me a match.<br> - Sorry, I never carry them.<br> - What? You said I'd like him.<br> - But I do have a lighter.<br> You're quite right, Mayhew,<br> I do like him. Thank you.<br> Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face<br> if she saw me now?<br> Then let's make absolutely sure<br> that she doesn't.<br> Splendid. All the instincts<br> of a skilled criminal.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Here.<br> Whether or not you murdered<br> a middle-aged widow,<br> you certainly saved the life<br> of an elderly barrister.<br> I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.<br> Christine, that's my wife, she thought<br> I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.<br> That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.<br> Now he thinks he needs a lawyer<br> and now I have two lawyers.<br> It's rather silly.<br> I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.<br> Only a barrister can actually<br> plead a case in court.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> - She shall not even find the ashes.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> I saw in the paper that Mrs French had<br> been found dead with her head bashed in.<br> It also said the police were anxious to<br> interview me since I visited that evening.<br> - Naturally, I went to the police station.<br> - Did they caution you?<br> I don't quite know.<br> They asked if I'd like to make a statement<br> and said they'd write it down and it might<br> be used against me. Is that a caution?<br> Well, it can't be helped now.<br> - They seemed quite satisfied.<br> - They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.<br> He thinks that he made a statement<br> and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious<br> that you will be regarded as the principal<br> suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.<br> I've done nothing!<br> Why should I be arrested?<br> This is England! You don't get arrested<br> or convicted for crimes you haven't done.<br> We try not to make a habit of it.<br> But it does happen, though, doesn't it?<br> Of course. There was that case of<br> that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.<br> In jail for years and they<br> suddenly found it was another chap.<br> - He'd been innocent!<br> - Unfortunate, but restitution was made.<br> He received a pardon, a bounty from the<br> crown, and was restored to normal life.<br> That's all right for him. What if<br> it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?<br> How would they have restored him<br> to his normal life then?<br> Mr Vole, you must not take<br> such a morbid point of view.<br> It's just when you say these things<br> are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.<br> Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,<br> most experienced barrister in London.<br> Let's get this straight. I may have done<br> something highly unethical.<br> I've taken your cigar<br> but I'm not taking your case. I can't.<br> I'm forbidden. My doctors would never<br> allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.<br> But if you'd like the case<br> handled by these chambers,<br> - I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.<br> - Yes. A very able man.<br> - I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.<br> - All right, sir, if you say so.<br> Hold this.<br> Carter?<br> I would like to see Brogan-Moore here<br> as soon as he comes in from court.<br> Sir Wilfrid, I have never<br> known such insubordination.<br> Not even as a nurse during the war.<br> What war was that?<br> The Crimean War, no doubt.<br> You'll like Brogan-Moore,<br> he's had excellent training. Under me.<br> This morning I had no lawyers at all<br> and now suddenly I have three.<br> We should explain<br> that I have very little money.<br> I shan't be able to pay<br> all the costs and fees.<br> We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.<br> He won't get very much.<br> I haven't had a job in four months.<br> - What sort of work do you do?<br> - Well, uh...<br> My last job was as a mechanic.<br> The foreman kept riding me all the time.<br> - I took it as long as I could, then I quit.<br> - And before that?<br> I worked in a department store, in toys,<br> demonstrating children's building sets.<br> Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.<br> Before that I tested electric blankets.<br> - Electric blankets?<br> - I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.<br> It's true, in a way,<br> but I'm really not like that.<br> My army service unsettled me. That and<br> living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.<br> It was fine there, though.<br> That's where I met my wife.<br> She was an actress, and a good one.<br> She's a wonderful wife to me, too.<br> But I haven't been much of a provider,<br> I'm afraid.<br> Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle<br> down now I've come back to this country.<br> - If I could just put my eggbeater across.<br> - Eggbeater?<br> Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.<br> Nothing big, just little household things.<br> Pocket pencil sharpeners,<br> key chain flashlights.<br> But my best is really this eggbeater.<br> It not only beats,<br> it also separates the yolk from the white.<br> Is that really desirable?<br> If you were a housewife,<br> you'd see it right away.<br> The trouble is, I need money<br> for manufacturing and promotion.<br> I was really hoping that's what Mrs<br> French might do for me after I met her.<br> - Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?<br> - That's rather funny in itself.<br> It was 3 September. I remember<br> because it's my wife's birthday.<br> I was window-shopping in Oxford Street,<br> daydreaming about what I'd buy for her,<br> if I had any money.<br> - You really like this one?<br> - Very much.<br> - You don't think it's too mad?<br> - Mad?<br> Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't<br> recommend it to every woman. But you?<br> - Why shouldn't you attract attention?<br> - You think so?<br> Absolutely. But if I could<br> suggest one little thing.<br> Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back<br> a bit like that. Show more of your face.<br> (squealing brakes)<br> - My bus. Goodbye.<br> - Good...<br> You buy that hat. I insist.<br> Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat -<br> a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.<br> I'm constantly surprised that women's<br> hats do not provoke more murders.<br> Go on, please.<br> I was only trying to be nice<br> to make her feel good.<br> I never dreamed I'd see her again.<br> Or the hat.<br> - But you did?<br> - Yes, a few weeks later.<br> Again, by accident. I was peddling my<br> eggbeaters and business was a little slow.<br> (gunfire and action-sequence music)<br> Would you mind, madam? Your hat.<br> - Oh, it's you!<br> - Hello!<br> It's your fault, you know.<br> You chose it yourself.<br> - May I?<br> - Sure, if you like.<br> Thank you. It's such a bother<br> taking it off and putting it back on again.<br> That chap is Jesse James. They've led<br> him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.<br> - Don't worry, he shoots his way out.<br> - He does?<br> - I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.<br> - You do?<br> I get restless so I go out. Then I find<br> I've no place to go so I go to the movies.<br> Sometimes I see the same one<br> two or three times. Ooh.<br> - Toffee?<br> - Oh, yes, please.<br> At this time you had no idea<br> that Mrs French was well-off?<br> No. Absolutely not.<br> We were sitting in the cheap seats.<br> All I knew was she seemed to be<br> very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.<br> She and her husband<br> lived abroad in British Nigeria.<br> He was in the colonial service.<br> He died in '45, of a heart attack.<br> Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.<br> Go on, young man.<br> Well, they finally<br> polished off Jesse James,<br> and after we left the movie<br> she invited me to her house for tea.<br> (Mrs French laughs)<br> I think it's the most fascinating thing<br> I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.<br> I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.<br> But this beats so quickly<br> and it separates too!<br> It must be cen-trifugal<br> or centrifugal, which is it?<br> It's specific gravity,<br> but it whips cream too.<br> Did you hear that, Janet?<br> It whips cream too.<br> We must have one. Is it expensive?<br> Compliments of the inventor,<br> manufacturer and sole distributor.<br> Thank you. We'll use it constantly,<br> won't we, Janet?<br> Come, we'd better get out of here.<br> Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.<br> Ha!<br> It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?<br> Shall we have a fire?<br> Why not?<br> This is a charming room.<br> Hubert and I collected all these things<br> when we lived in Africa.<br> Hubert was my husband.<br> Well, now, there's a loveable chap.<br> That's the mask of the witch doctor.<br> He wore it when he pulled<br> our servants' teeth.<br> So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.<br> - Hubert was so witty.<br> - Yes, I can see that.<br> Oh, here's tea.<br> - Let's use our good silver and china.<br> - Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.<br> - This is perfectly all right.<br> - Lemon or milk, please?<br> - I don't really care.<br> - Would you prefer sherry?<br> - That'd be fine.<br> - We've no' got any.<br> Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,<br> the one we bought last Christmas.<br> If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted<br> egg in the kitchen ready and separated.<br> Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.<br> It's just that she's terribly Scotch.<br> Oh, is she? I thought<br> she came with the collection.<br> You know, maybe<br> I'll take a glass of sherry myself.<br> I feel like Christmas, somehow.<br> After that I saw her once or twice a week.<br> She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.<br> We'd talk, play canasta,<br> listen to gramophone records,<br> Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.<br> It's so weird to think of her now,<br> lying in that living room, murdered.<br> I assure you she's been moved by now.<br> To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,<br> and unsanitary.<br> Tell Sir Wilfrid about<br> the evening of the murder.<br> I went around to see her<br> about eight o'clock.<br> She fixed a sandwich,<br> we talked, listened to The Mikado.<br> I left about nine. I walked home.<br> I got there about half past.<br> I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out<br> of court, in the witness box, anywhere!<br> How much money did you get<br> from Mrs French?<br> - Nothing.<br> - The truth. How much?<br> - Why should she give me any money?<br> - Because she was in love with you.<br> That's ridiculous. She liked me.<br> She pampered me like an aunt.<br> But that's all, I swear.<br> - Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?<br> - I did!<br> But you never took your wife along<br> when you went there. Why not?<br> - Because...<br> - Because what?<br> Because she was under the impression<br> we didn't get along too well.<br> - Is that true?<br> - No! We love each other.<br> - Then how did she get that impression?<br> - She just seemed to want to believe it.<br> - You never corrected her. Why?<br> - I was afraid she'd lose interest.<br> Because she was rich,<br> and you were after her money.<br> Well, yes, in a way.<br> I was hoping for a loan for my new<br> invention. Just a few hundred pounds.<br> An honest business proposition, that's all.<br> Is that so wicked?<br> You knew it was<br> the housekeeper's day off?<br> - Well, yes.<br> - You went there because she'd be alone?<br> No, because I thought<br> she might be lonely.<br> All right, lonely. You and the rich<br> lonely widow all alone in that house<br> with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.<br> Perhaps you turned up<br> the volume to drown her cries.<br> - When I left her she was alive!<br> - When Janet came back she was dead.<br> The house had been ransacked! It said<br> in the papers. It must've been a burglar.<br> I didn't do it. No matter<br> how bad things look, I didn't do it!<br> You must believe me.<br> You do believe me, don't you?<br> I do now, but I wasn't sure.<br> That's why I subjected your eyes<br> and my arteries to that ordeal.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - That's all right.<br> As for things looking bad, they<br> don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.<br> - Apparently you've no alibi at all.<br> - But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.<br> - By bus or underground?<br> - No, I walked. It was a fine night.<br> - Did anyone see you?<br> - Christine saw me when I got home.<br> It was 9.26. I know because I went right to<br> work on a clock I've been tinkering with.<br> - My wife will tell you.<br> - Your wife loves you, yes?<br> Very much.<br> We're devoted to each other.<br> You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a<br> devoted wife does not carry much weight.<br> People might think<br> Christine would lie on my account?<br> It has been known, Mr Vole.<br> Blood is thicker than evidence.<br> - Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.<br> - So good to have you out of hospital.<br> I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on<br> parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.<br> - This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - The Emily French murder.<br> - Oh, how do you do?<br> - Badly, thank you.<br> A mass of circumstantial evidence.<br> No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.<br> - Tossing it into your lap.<br> - Much obliged.<br> Your line of defence,<br> however, will be lack of motive.<br> You will agree that we can rule out<br> a crime of passion, hm?<br> That leaves us with a murder for profit.<br> If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs<br> French, why cut off the source of supply?<br> Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,<br> why kill the goose before it was laid?<br> No motive. No motive whatsoever.<br> - You find some flaw in this reasoning?<br> - No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.<br> Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole<br> very responsive and quite candid.<br> So candid, he's already told me<br> we'll have to sue him for our fees.<br> Oh, we'll simply put a lean<br> on Mr Vole's 80,000.<br> - What? 80,000?<br> - The? 80,000 Mrs French left you.<br> Left me?<br> They opened Mrs French's<br> bank vault today and found her will.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - ? 80,000!<br> And I was worried about a couple<br> of hundred for that silly eggbeater.<br> I must call Christine.<br> Oh.<br> This doesn't make things<br> look any better for me, does it?<br> - No. I wouldn't think so.<br> - So now they'll say I did have a motive.<br> They will indeed.? 80,000 makes for<br> a very handsome motive.<br> I thought you were crazy<br> but now they will arrest me!<br> It's not unlikely.<br> (car pulls up)<br> As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.<br> They're on their way up now.<br> I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea<br> she'd any intention of leaving me money.<br> - If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?<br> - We'll certainly bring that out in court.<br> - It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.<br> - Chief Inspector as of last month.<br> Chief Inspector? They must think<br> a lot of you at Scotland Yard.<br> You're getting the de luxe treatment.<br> - Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.<br> - Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.<br> That's perfectly all right.<br> I never object to the actions of the police<br> - except once in a great while in court.<br> - Yes, sir, I still have the scars.<br> You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.<br> This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search<br> him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.<br> - Is your name Leonard Vole?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> I have a warrant for your arrest<br> on the charge of murdering Emily French.<br> I must warn you that anything you say<br> may be taken down and used in evidence.<br> Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?<br> That won't be necessary, sir.<br> I've never been arrested before,<br> not even for walking a dog off a lead<br> - or having a beer after hours.<br> - There's no disgrace in being arrested.<br> Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,<br> even barristers have stood in the dock.<br> - Somebody better call my wife.<br> - I will, don't worry.<br> I'll go too, see you're properly charged.<br> - You will see to it that he is well-treated?<br> - We will.<br> Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.<br> - That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.<br> - I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.<br> We ought to be going, Mr Vole.<br> One thing I've learned for sure, never<br> look in a window with women's hats.<br> Good day, sir.<br> Makes a very nice impression,<br> doesn't he?<br> - Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?<br> - Passed with flying colours.<br> I hope he does as well in the dock.<br> This is sticky, you know.<br> Of course. The prosecution will<br> blast in with their heaviest artillery.<br> All you'll have is one little popgun,<br> an alibi furnished by his wife.<br> Isn't that an intriguing challenge?<br> I think I'd like it more if it was less<br> of a challenge and less intriguing.<br> Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.<br> In bed in one minute or she'll resign.<br> Splendid. Give her a month's pay<br> and kick her down the stairs.<br> Either you take care of yourself<br> or I, too, shall resign.<br> This is blackmail.<br> But you're quite right.<br> For my first day this has already<br> been rather hectic. I should be in bed.<br> I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole<br> and have her come over. Will you sit in?<br> Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope<br> with emotional wives drenched in tears.<br> Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,<br> waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.<br> Take me, I'm yours.<br> Oh!<br> About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,<br> especially when you tell her of the arrest.<br> Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare<br> for hysterics, even a fainting spell.<br> Better have smelling salts ready,<br> box of tissues and a nip of brandy.<br> (woman) I do not think<br> that will be necessary.<br> I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully,<br> and I never use smelling salts<br> because they puff up the eyes.<br> I'm Christine Vole.<br> How do you do?<br> This is Mr Brogan-Moore.<br> How do you do?<br> - I am Wilfrid Robarts.<br> - How do you do?<br> My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid<br> we have bad news for you.<br> - Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.<br> - There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.<br> Leonard has been arrested<br> and charged with murder. Is that it?<br> - Yes.<br> - I knew he would be, I told him so.<br> I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.<br> Call it what you like.<br> What is the next step?<br> Your husband will have<br> to stand trial, I'm afraid.<br> Will you explain the procedure?<br> Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.<br> Oh?<br> - You will not defend Leonard?<br> - Regrettably not.<br> My health, or, rather,<br> the lack of it, forbids me.<br> It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described<br> you as champion of the hopeless cause.<br> Is it, perhaps,<br> that this cause is too hopeless?<br> I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It<br> was a mistake to let you come back here.<br> I should have taken you<br> to a rest-home or a resort.<br> Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.<br> Shut up. You just want<br> to see me in those nasty shorts.<br> Come now, Sir Wilfrid,<br> you must not think of it.<br> You must get ready for sleep,<br> think beautiful thoughts.<br> Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,<br> tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.<br> After your rest<br> we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.<br> Then perhaps<br> we'll have a walk around the square.<br> You know, I feel sorry<br> for that nice Mr Vole.<br> And not just because he was arrested,<br> but that wife of his. She must be German.<br> That's what happens when we let our<br> boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.<br> The government should do something<br> about foreign wives. Like an embargo.<br> How else can we take care of our own<br> surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?<br> All right. Hop in!<br> Sir Wilfrid?<br> Sir Wilfrid!<br> Come back!<br> Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had<br> been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.<br> Go on.<br> I knew when he came home with a pair<br> of green socks she'd knitted for him.<br> That's quite natural.<br> I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.<br> Leonard can be very endearing.<br> He hates that particular shade of green<br> and the socks were two sizes too large,<br> but he wore them just the same<br> to give her pleasure.<br> Leonard has a way with women.<br> I only hope he has an all-woman jury.<br> They will carry him from court in triumph.<br> A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know<br> Mrs French left your husband money?<br> Yes. A lot of money.<br> Of course, your husband had<br> no previous knowledge of this bequest?<br> Is that what he told you?<br> Surely you're not suggesting different?<br> Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.<br> Clearly, she had come to look upon your<br> husband as a son or favourite nephew.<br> You think Mrs French looked<br> upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?<br> I do. An entirely natural<br> and understandable relationship.<br> What hypocrites you are in this country.<br> Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.<br> - Do you mind if I ask you a question?<br> - Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.<br> You realise your husband's entire<br> defence rests on his word and yours?<br> - I realise that.<br> - And that the jury will be quite sceptical<br> of the word of a man accused of murder<br> when supported only by that of his wife?<br> - I realise that too.<br> - Let us, then, at least make sure<br> - the two are not in conflict.<br> - By all means, let's.<br> I assume you want to help your husband?<br> Of course I want to help Leonard. I want<br> to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.<br> There. Isn't that<br> more comfortable for you?<br> Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.<br> On the night of the murder your husband<br> came home before 9.30. Correct?<br> Precisely. Isn't that<br> what he wants me to say?<br> Isn't it the truth?<br> Of course.<br> But when I told the police,<br> I do not think they believed me.<br> Maybe I didn't say it well.<br> Maybe because of my accent.<br> My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts<br> we accept the evidence<br> of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian<br> and who must have an interpreter.<br> We accept the evidence<br> of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,<br> as long as they tell the truth.<br> You're aware that when you're<br> in the witness box you will be sworn<br> - and you will testify under oath?<br> - Yes.<br> Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely<br> and did not go out again.<br> The truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth. Is that better?<br> - Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?<br> - Leonard thinks I do.<br> - Well, do you?<br> - Am I already under oath?<br> Whatever your gambit may be,<br> do you know that, under British law,<br> you cannot be called to give testimony<br> damaging to your husband?<br> How very convenient.<br> We are dealing with a capital crime.<br> The prosecution<br> will try to hang your husband.<br> He is not my husband.<br> Leonard and I went through<br> a form of marriage,<br> but I had a husband living somewhere<br> in East Germany, in the Russian zone.<br> - Did you tell Leonard?<br> - I did not. It would have been stupid.<br> He would not have married me and<br> I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.<br> But he did marry you<br> and brought you safely here.<br> Don't you think you should be grateful?<br> One can get very tired of gratitude.<br> Your husband loves you<br> very much, does he not?<br> Leonard?<br> He worships the ground I walk on.<br> And you?<br> You want to know too much.<br> Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.<br> Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.<br> Your visit has been most reassuring.<br> Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him<br> an alibi and I shall be very convincing.<br> There will be tears in my eyes when I say<br> "Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."<br> You're a very remarkable woman,<br> Mrs Vole.<br> And you're satisfied, I hope?<br> - I'm damned if I'm satisfied!<br> - Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?<br> That woman's up to something. But what?<br> The prosecution will break her down<br> in no time when she's in the witness box.<br> This case is going to be rather<br> like the charge of the Light Brigade<br> or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.<br> Quite one-sided.<br> With the odds all on the other side.<br> I haven't got much to go on, have I?<br> The fact is, I've got nothing.<br> Let me ask you something.<br> Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?<br> Do you?<br> Do you?<br> I'm not sure.<br> Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.<br> Of course, I'll do my best.<br> It's all right, Brogan-Moore.<br> I'll take it from here.<br> I have called Dr Harrison and given him<br> a report on your shocking behaviour.<br> - Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.<br> - Sir Wilfrid!<br> Did you hear me? A match!<br> Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are<br> going to represent me. I'm very grateful.<br> I struck a bargain with my doctors. They<br> exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.<br> - Thank you.<br> - There's hope that we'll both survive.<br> - Get into these. We need a photograph.<br> - Why?<br> This is what you were wearing that night.<br> We'll circulate a photo on the chance<br> that someone saw you on your way home.<br> Over here against the wall, please.<br> Hold it.<br> One more in profile, please.<br> Do we really need this? My wife knows<br> what time I came home that night.<br> A disinterested witness<br> may be of more value.<br> Yes, of course,<br> Christine is an interested witness.<br> I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.<br> I don't understand it.<br> Why hasn't she come to see me?<br> Won't they let her see me?<br> I mean, it's been two weeks now.<br> Mayhew, give me the reports.<br> Have you been talking to her?<br> Is there something the matter?<br> I want to read a portion of the evidence<br> of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.<br> "Mr Vole helped Mrs French<br> with her business affairs,<br> particularly her income tax returns."<br> Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms<br> are very complicated.<br> There's also a hint you may<br> have helped her draft her new will.<br> Well, that's not true!<br> If Janet said that she's lying.<br> She was always against me,<br> I don't know why!<br> It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into<br> the wheels of her Victorian household.<br> Now, this cut in your wrist.<br> You say you cut yourself with a knife?<br> Well, that's true, I did.<br> I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.<br> But that was two days after. Christine<br> was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.<br> Are you keeping something from me?<br> Is she ill? Was she shocked?<br> All things considered, she took it well.<br> Though that may be only on the surface.<br> Wives are often profoundly<br> disturbed at such a time.<br> Yes, it must be hard.<br> We've never been separated before.<br> - Not since our first meeting.<br> - How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?<br> In Germany in 1945.<br> It's rather funny. The very first time<br> I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.<br> I was stationed outside Hamburg,<br> with an RAF maintenance unit.<br> I'd just installed a shower in the officers'<br> billet, so they gave me a weekend pass.<br> (music and cheers)<br> (woman) Come on!<br> [ Join the party ]<br> [ Have a hearty glass of rum ]<br> [ Don't ever think about tomorrow ]<br> [ For tomorrow may never come ]<br> [ When I find me a happy place ]<br> [ That's where I wanna stay ]<br> [ Time is nothing<br> as long as I'm living it up this way ]<br> [ I may never go home any more ]<br> [ Dim the lights<br> and start locking the door ]<br> [ Give your arms to me<br> Give your charms to me ]<br> [ After all that's what sailors are for ]<br> [ I've got kisses and kisses galore ]<br> [ That have never been tasted before ]<br> [ If you treat me right<br> This could be the night ]<br> [ I may never go home ]<br> [ I may never go home ]<br> [ I may never go home ]<br> [ I may never go home ]<br> [ I may never go home any more ]<br> [ I may never go home any more ]<br> Hey, Frulein, show us some legs.<br> They rob you blind<br> and then throw you a ruddy sailor!<br> - Come on, let's see 'em.<br> - We want legs!<br> Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!<br> All right, Frulein,<br> if you won't show 'em, I will.<br> (cheering)<br> (whistle)<br> All right, outside, everybody.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Come on.<br> Bring him round to the other truck.<br> We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!<br> Gesundheit.<br> - What are you looking for?<br> - My accordion.<br> Oh, let me help you.<br> (discordant noise)<br> - I think I found it.<br> - Step on it again, it's still breathing.<br> (discordant noise)<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> You better go. We've had trouble enough.<br> Well, it's your own fault. That costume<br> in the picture gave the boys ideas<br> - then those trousers let them down hard.<br> - That costume went in the first raid.<br> Then raid by raid, my other dresses,<br> and now you've bombed my trousers.<br> Cigarette? Gum?<br> You're burning my nose.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - That's all right.<br> How about a cup of coffee?<br> I've got a tin of coffee.<br> How much?<br> I don't know.<br> What's the rate of exchange?<br> - Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.<br> - It's instant coffee.<br> Got any hot water at your place?<br> - Sometimes.<br> - Let's take a chance. Where do you live?<br> Nearby.<br> Come.<br> Sorry, it's the maid's night off.<br> This is pretty horrible.<br> In a gemtlich sort of way.<br> Oh, it's fine now.<br> I used to have a roommate. A dancer.<br> She had luck, she married a Canadian.<br> She now lives in Toronto.<br> She has a Ford automobile.<br> Make yourself comfortable,<br> the stove is slow these days.<br> That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.<br> No, not that chair. It holds up the<br> beam and that holds up the ceiling.<br> You'd better sit down on the cot.<br> The cot?<br> Getting more gemtlich all the time.<br> Are you married?<br> - Why?<br> - Well, the, um...<br> Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.<br> I just wear it when I'm working.<br> Gives a little protection with all the men.<br> - Didn't work too well tonight, did it?<br> - No, tonight was bad.<br> But it's getting better.<br> - Where's the coffee?<br> - Ah, coffee, ja voll.<br> Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand<br> that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.<br> Is that a fair rate of exchange?<br> Very fair.<br> Would you be interested<br> in having the whole tin?<br> I would.<br> - How are you fixed for sugar?<br> - I could use some.<br> Milk?<br> Sure.<br> Milk. Sugar.<br> It's a pleasure to do business with you.<br> Yeah.<br> I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,<br> - bacon, marmalade.<br> - I don't know if I can afford it.<br> Don't worry, we'll work out something,<br> like an instalment plan.<br> [ I may never go home any more ]<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> Now you have no ceiling.<br> - Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.<br> - Why fix it? It's not raining.<br> Ooh.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I think so. My head aches a little.<br> Maybe I can fix it.<br> I'm good at it.<br> I had a weekend pass,<br> a month's pay in my pocket.<br> - And she already had a wedding ring.<br> - Yes, that's right.<br> We got married. When I got out<br> of the service I brought her here.<br> It was wonderful.<br> I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.<br> First time she saw it, she was so happy<br> she broke down and cried.<br> Naturally. She had a solid roof<br> over her head and a British passport.<br> You don't know her, how she feels about<br> me. You will when she gives evidence.<br> Mr Vole, I must tell you<br> I am not putting her in the witness box.<br> You're not? Why not?<br> She's a foreigner, unfamiliar<br> with the subtleties of our language.<br> The prosecution could easily trip her up.<br> I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.<br> We can't take chances.<br> Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll<br> is waiting in the car with her pills<br> - and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.<br> - Officer.<br> - But Christine must give evidence.<br> - Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.<br> For no other reason than I'm a mean,<br> ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.<br> Let us wish each other luck.<br> Look, I can't face this without Christine.<br> I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.<br> Touching, isn't it?<br> The way he counts on his wife.<br> Yes. Like a drowning man<br> clutching at a razor blade.<br> Leonard Stephen Vole, you are<br> charged on indictment for that you,<br> on the 14th day of October,<br> in the county of London,<br> murdered Emily Jane French.<br> How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?<br> Are you guilty or not guilty?<br> Not guilty.<br> (murmuring)<br> Members of the jury,<br> the prisoner stands indicted for that he,<br> on the 14th day of October,<br> murdered Emily Jane French.<br> To this indictment<br> he has pleaded not guilty.<br> And it is your charge to say,<br> having heard the evidence,<br> whether he be guilty or not.<br> Members of the jury,<br> by the oath which you have just taken,<br> you have sworn<br> to try this case on the evidence.<br> You must shut out<br> from your minds everything<br> except what will take place in this court.<br> You may proceed<br> for the prosecution, Mr Myers.<br> May it please you, my lord.<br> Members of the jury,<br> I appear in this case with my learned<br> friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.<br> And my learned friends<br> Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore<br> appear for the defence.<br> I trust we are not to be deprived<br> of the learned and stimulating<br> presence of Sir Wilfrid?<br> My lord, may I assure my learned friend<br> that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.<br> He's slightly incapacitated,<br> but will be in his seat presently.<br> My lord, may I express my regret that<br> Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.<br> You may, Mr Myers. You may also<br> proceed with the case for the prosecution.<br> Thank you, my lord.<br> The facts in this case are simple<br> and, to a point, not in dispute.<br> You will hear how the prisoner made<br> the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,<br> a woman of 56.<br> How he was treated by her<br> with kindness and even affection.<br> On the night of October 14 last,<br> between 9.30 and 10,<br> Mrs French was murdered.<br> Medical testimony<br> will be introduced to prove<br> that death was caused by a blow<br> from a blunt and heavy instrument,<br> and it is the case for the prosecution<br> that the blow was dealt<br> by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.<br> That's not true! I didn't do it!<br> (murmuring)<br> Among the witnesses,<br> you will hear police evidence,<br> also the evidence of Mrs French's<br> housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,<br> and from the medical<br> and laboratory experts,<br> and the evidence of the murdered<br> woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.<br> I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,<br> Criminal Investigation Department,<br> - New Scotland Yard.<br> - (man) Chief Inspector Hearne.<br> - Chief Inspector Hearne.<br> - Chief Inspector Hearne.<br> This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.<br> I always get it the first day of a trial.<br> You shouldn't be here at all.<br> - I should be in court, the trial's begun.<br> - Syringe, please.<br> Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.<br> It may interest you to know<br> that I am descended from a warrior family<br> which traces its brave past<br> back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.<br> You're to have a calcium injection daily,<br> - tranquillising pill every hour.<br> - I'll set my wristwatch alarm.<br> Any pain or shortness of breath,<br> pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets<br> under your tongue.<br> Oh, and I'll leave you some...<br> That's enough, Doctor.<br> The judge will be asking for a saliva test.<br> Carter, I'd better take<br> that Thermos of cocoa with me.<br> - Helps me wash down the pills.<br> - Let me see it, please.<br> My learned patient is not above<br> substituting brandy for cocoa.<br> It is cocoa. So sorry.<br> If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,<br> I would strike you.<br> Take care of this, Carter.<br> Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,<br> you must avoid overexcitement.<br> Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.<br> Watch your temper.<br> Keep your blood pressure down.<br> Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,<br> what with the pills and the cocoa.<br> Come along, Carter.<br> From the body temperature<br> and other factors,<br> we placed the time of death<br> at between 9.30 and 10pm,<br> approximately 30 minutes before Janet<br> McKenzie returned home and called us.<br> Death was instantaneous, caused by one<br> blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.<br> Were there any signs of a struggle?<br> None. Just the one blow.<br> Would that indicate that the murderer<br> had taken Mrs French by surprise?<br> My lord, I must object.<br> My learned friend refers<br> to the assailant as "the murderer".<br> We have not yet determined whether<br> the assailant was a man or a woman.<br> It could quite conceivably<br> have been "the murderess".<br> Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in<br> time to catch you on a point of grammar.<br> Please rephrase your question.<br> Yes, my lord. Inspector,<br> is it your opinion that the assailant,<br> whether he, she or it,<br> had taken Mrs French by surprise?<br> My lord, I am taken by surprise<br> that my learned friend should try to solicit<br> from the witness an opinion, not a fact.<br> Quite so. You'll have<br> to do better than that, Mr Myers.<br> My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.<br> - Is that better?<br> - That's much better.<br> (murmuring)<br> Silence! Silence!<br> (gavel)<br> Very well, Inspector,<br> let us proceed with the facts.<br> After establishing the cause and the time<br> of death, what did you then do?<br> A search was made, photographs were<br> taken and the premises fingerprinted.<br> - What fingerprints did you discover?<br> - I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,<br> those of Janet McKenzie, and some which<br> later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.<br> - No others?<br> - No others.<br> Did you say the room had the appearance<br> that a robbery had been committed?<br> Yes. Things were strewn about and the<br> window had been broken near the catch.<br> There was glass on the floor,<br> and fragments were found outside.<br> The glass outside was not consistent with<br> the window being forced from the outside.<br> You're saying that someone made it look<br> as if it had been forced from the outside?<br> My lord, I must object. My learned friend<br> is putting words in the witness' mouth.<br> After all, if he insists<br> on answering his own questions,<br> the presence of the witness<br> would seem superfluous.<br> Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?<br> Yes, my lord.<br> Inspector,<br> did you ascertain if any of the murdered<br> woman's property was missing?<br> According to the housekeeper,<br> nothing was missing.<br> In your experience, Inspector,<br> when burglars or burglaresses<br> break into a house,<br> do they leave without taking anything?<br> No, sir.<br> - Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Is that the jacket?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - That is exhibit P1, my lord.<br> Where did you find this, Inspector?<br> That is the jacket<br> found in the prisoner's flat,<br> which I handed to our lab<br> to test for bloodstains.<br> - And did you find any bloodstains?<br> - Yes.<br> Though an attempt<br> had been made to wash them out.<br> What tests were made?<br> First to determine<br> if the stains were human blood,<br> then to classify it by group or type.<br> And was the blood<br> of a particular group or type?<br> Yes, sir. It is type O.<br> And did you subsequently<br> test the blood of the dead woman?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - What type was that?<br> - The same. Type O.<br> - (murmuring)<br> Thank you, Inspector.<br> No further questions.<br> Inspector, you say the only fingerprints<br> you found were those of Mrs French,<br> Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.<br> In your experience, when a burglar breaks<br> in, does he usually leave fingerprints<br> - or does he wear gloves?<br> - He wears gloves.<br> So the absence<br> of fingerprints in a robbery<br> - would hardly surprise you?<br> - No, sir.<br> Can't we surmise the burglar might have<br> entered a presumably empty house,<br> suddenly encountered<br> Mrs French and struck her,<br> then, realising she was dead,<br> fled without taking anything?<br> I submit, my lord,<br> that it is entirely impossible<br> to guess what went on in the mind<br> of some entirely imaginary burglar.<br> With or without gloves.<br> Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,<br> but confine ourselves to facts.<br> Inspector, when you questioned<br> the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,<br> did he not show you<br> a recently-healed scar on his wrist,<br> - saying he had cut himself slicing bread?<br> - Yes, sir, that is what he said.<br> And were you not told<br> the same thing by his wife?<br> - Yes, sir. But afterwards...<br> - Just a simple yes or no, please.<br> Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife<br> and tell you that her husband<br> had cut his wrist while slicing bread?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - I will ask you to examine this knife.<br> Just test the edge of it<br> with your finger. Carefully!<br> You agree that the point<br> and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Now, if such a knife were to slip,<br> might it not inflict a cut<br> that would bleed profusely?<br> Yes, sir, it might.<br> Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains<br> on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,<br> as was the blood of Mrs French, and<br> they were both found to be of group O.<br> - That is correct.<br> - However,<br> if the prisoner's blood<br> were also of this same group,<br> then the stains on his jacket<br> may well have resulted<br> from the household accident<br> he described to you.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Did you examine<br> the prisoner's blood, Inspector?<br> No, sir.<br> I have here a certificate<br> stating that Leonard Stephen Vole<br> is a blood donor<br> at the North London Hospital.<br> And that his blood is group O.<br> (murmuring)<br> Thank you, Inspector.<br> Inspector, granted that the cut<br> on the wrist was caused by that knife,<br> is there anything to show<br> whether it was an accident<br> or done deliberately after the murder<br> to account for the bloodstains?<br> - Oh, really, my lord!<br> - I withdraw the question.<br> You may stand down.<br> - Call Janet McKenzie.<br> - Janet McKenzie.<br> - Janet McKenzie.<br> - Janet McKenzie.<br> I swear by Almighty God<br> that the evidence...<br> (buzzer)<br> ...the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth.<br> Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.<br> - Your name is Janet McKenzie?<br> - Aye, that's my name.<br> - When did you first come to London?<br> - That was many years ago. 28 years ago.<br> - Where do you live?<br> - Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,<br> I've moved in with my niece<br> at 19 Glenister Road.<br> You were companion-housekeeper<br> to the late Mrs Emily French?<br> I was her housekeeper!<br> I've no opinion of companions,<br> poor feckless bodies, afraid<br> of a bit of honest domestic work.<br> I meant you were on friendly terms, not<br> altogether those of mistress and servant.<br> Aye. Ten years I was with her<br> and looked after her.<br> She knew me and she trusted me.<br> Many's the time<br> I prevented her doing a foolish thing.<br> Please tell us, in your own words, about<br> the events of the evening of October 14.<br> It was a Friday and my night out. I was<br> going to see my niece at Glenister Road,<br> which is about five minutes' walk.<br> I left the house at half past seven.<br> I promised to take her<br> a dress pattern that she admired.<br> - Och, is this thing necessary?<br> - An excellent question.<br> However, it has been installed at<br> considerable expense to the taxpayers,<br> so let us take advantage of it.<br> Please continue.<br> Well, when I got to my niece's,<br> I found I'd left the pattern behind.<br> So after supper I slipped<br> back to get it as it was no distance.<br> I got back to the house at 25 past 9.<br> I let myself in<br> and went upstairs to my room.<br> As I passed the sitting room, I heard the<br> prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.<br> - No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!<br> - (court murmurs)<br> Talking and laughing they were.<br> But it was no business of mine,<br> so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.<br> Now, let us be very exact as to the time.<br> You say that you<br> re-entered the house at 25 past 9?<br> Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my<br> room next to my clock so I saw the time.<br> - And it was 25 past 9.<br> - Go on, please.<br> I went back to my niece. Och,<br> she was delighted with the pattern. Si...<br> Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11,<br> then I said good night and I come home.<br> I went into the sitting room to see<br> if the mistress wanted anything<br> before she went to bed.<br> And there she was, dead.<br> And everything tossed hither and thither.<br> Did you really think<br> that a burglary had been committed?<br> My lord, I must protest!<br> I will not allow that question<br> to be answered, Mr Myers.<br> Miss McKenzie, were you aware<br> that Leonard Vole was a married man?<br> No, indeed.<br> And neither was the mistress.<br> - Janet!<br> - My lord, I must object.<br> What Mrs French knew or did not know is<br> pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.<br> Let me put it this way.<br> You formed the opinion<br> that Mrs French thought<br> Leonard Vole was a single man?<br> - Have you any facts to support this?<br> - The books that she ordered.<br> A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,<br> and the one about Disraeli and his wife.<br> Both of them about women that married<br> men years younger than themselves. Oh!<br> - I knew what she was thinking.<br> - I'm afraid we cannot admit that.<br> - Why?<br> - (laughter)<br> Members of the jury, it is possible<br> for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli<br> without contemplating marriage<br> with a man younger than herself.<br> (laughter)<br> Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs<br> French made to dispose of her money?<br> She had her old will revoked<br> and a new one drawn up.<br> I heard her calling Mr Stokes,<br> her solicitor.<br> He was there at the time.<br> The prisoner, I mean.<br> You heard Mrs French<br> and the prisoner discussing her new will?<br> Yes. He was to have all her money,<br> she told him,<br> as she had no near relations nor anybody<br> that meant to her what he did.<br> - When did this take place?<br> - On October 8.<br> One week to the day<br> before she was murdered.<br> Thank you.<br> That concludes my examination.<br> Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.<br> Would you...? Thank you.<br> Miss McKenzie, you have<br> given evidence about two wills.<br> In the old will, that which was revoked,<br> were you not to receive<br> the bulk of Mrs French's estate?<br> That's so.<br> Whereas in the new will, except for<br> a bequest to you of a small annuity,<br> the principal beneficiary<br> is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.<br> It'll be a wicked injustice<br> if he ever touches a penny of that money.<br> It is entirely understandable<br> that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.<br> I'm not antagonistic to him.<br> He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.<br> But I'm not antagonistic to him.<br> (laughter)<br> I suggest you formed this opinion<br> because his friendship with Mrs French<br> cost you the bulk of her estate.<br> - I've never liked him.<br> - Your candour is refreshing.<br> Now. On the night of October 14<br> you say you heard the prisoner<br> and Mrs French talking together.<br> - What did you hear them say?<br> - I didn't hear what they actually said.<br> You mean you only heard the voices?<br> - The murmur of voices?<br> - They were laughing.<br> What makes you say<br> the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?<br> - I know his voice well enough.<br> - The door was closed, was it not?<br> - Aye, that's so.<br> - You were in a hurry to get the pattern<br> so you probably walked<br> quickly past the closed door,<br> yet you are sure<br> you heard Leonard Vole's voice?<br> I was there long enough<br> to hear what I heard.<br> Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest<br> to the jury that you were eavesdropping.<br> It was him in there.<br> Who else could it have been?<br> What you mean is that you wanted it to<br> be him. That's the way your mind worked.<br> Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes<br> watch television in the evening?<br> Yes. She was fond<br> of a talk or a good play.<br> Wasn't it possible when you<br> returned home and passed the door,<br> what you really heard was the television<br> and a man and woman's<br> voices and laughter?<br> There was a play called Lover's Leap<br> on the television that night.<br> - It was not the television.<br> - Oh, why not?<br> Because the television was away<br> being repaired that week, that's why.<br> (laughter)<br> (gavel)<br> Silence! Silence!<br> Odd. It's not time yet.<br> If my learned friend has no further<br> questions, I'd like...<br> I have not quite finished.<br> You are registered, are you not,<br> under the National Health Insurance Act?<br> Aye, that's so.<br> Four and sixpence I pay out every week.<br> That's a terrible lot of money<br> for a working woman to pay.<br> I am sure that many agree with you.<br> Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply<br> to the National Health Insurance for...<br> - (quietly)... a hearing aid?<br> - For... for what?<br> I protest against the way<br> in which this question was put!<br> I will repeat the question, my lord.<br> I asked you in a normal tone of voice,<br> audible to everyone in open court,<br> did you apply to the National Health<br> Insurance for a hearing aid?<br> Yes, I did.<br> - Did you get it?<br> - Not yet.<br> However, you state that you walked past<br> a door, which is four inches of solid oak,<br> you heard voices,<br> and you are willing to swear<br> that you could distinguish the voice of...<br> (quietly)... the prisoner, Leonard Vole.<br> Who? Who?<br> (murmuring)<br> No further questions.<br> Och, maybe you could help me,<br> Your Lordship.<br> Six months ago I applied for<br> my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.<br> My dear Miss McKenzie, considering<br> the rubbish that is being talked nowadays,<br> you are missing very little.<br> You may stand down now.<br> (laughter)<br> (Myers) Call Police Constable Jeffries.<br> - Police Constable Jeffries.<br> - Police Constable Jeffries.<br> I swear by Almighty God<br> that the evidence I shall give<br> shall be the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth.<br> Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?<br> No, my lord. I now call the final witness<br> for the prosecution, Christine Helm.<br> - Christine Helm!<br> - Christine Helm.<br> Christine.<br> I swear by Almighty God<br> that the evidence I shall give<br> shall be the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth.<br> My lord, I have the most serious objection<br> to this witness being summoned,<br> as she is the wife of the prisoner.<br> I call my learned friend's attention<br> to the fact that I summoned<br> not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.<br> - Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?<br> - Yes. Christine Helm.<br> And you have been living<br> as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?<br> - Yes.<br> - Are you actually his wife?<br> No.<br> I went through a marriage ceremony<br> with him, but I already had a husband.<br> - He's still alive.<br> - Christine, that's not true!<br> There is proof of a marriage<br> between the witness and the prisoner,<br> but is there any proof<br> of a so-called previous marriage?<br> My lord, the so-called previous marriage<br> is, in fact, well-documented.<br> Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage<br> between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,<br> the ceremony having taken place<br> in Breslau on 18 April 1942?<br> Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.<br> I don't see any reason why this witness<br> should not be qualified to give evidence.<br> You're willing to give evidence against the<br> man you've been calling your husband?<br> Yes.<br> You stated to the police that on the night<br> that Mrs French was murdered,<br> Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30<br> and returned at 25 minutes past 9.<br> Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?<br> No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.<br> Christine, what are you saying?<br> It's not true. You know it's not true!<br> (murmuring)<br> Silence!<br> I must have silence.<br> As your counsel will tell you,<br> Vole, you will very shortly<br> have an opportunity of<br> speaking in your own defence.<br> Leonard Vole returned, you say,<br> at ten minutes past ten.<br> - And what happened next?<br> - He was breathing hard, very excited.<br> He threw off his coat<br> and examined the sleeves.<br> Then he told me to wash the cuffs.<br> - They had blood on them.<br> - Go on.<br> - I said "What have you done?"<br> - What did the prisoner say?<br> He said "I've killed her."<br> Christine! Why are you lying?<br> Why are you saying these things?<br> - What an awful woman.<br> - She's evil. I've known it all along.<br> If the defence so desires,<br> I will adjourn for a short time<br> so that the prisoner<br> may gain control of himself.<br> My lord is most gracious,<br> but pray let the witness continue.<br> We are all of us caught up<br> in the suspense of this horror fiction.<br> To have to hear it in instalments<br> might prove unendurable.<br> - Proceed, Mr Myers.<br> - Mrs Helm,<br> when the prisoner said "I have killed her",<br> did you know to whom he referred?<br> It was that woman<br> he had been seeing so often.<br> When questioned by the police, you told<br> them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.<br> Yes. Because Leonard<br> asked me to say that.<br> But you've changed your story now. Why?<br> I cannot go on lying to save him.<br> I said to the police what he wanted<br> because I'm grateful to him.<br> He married me<br> and brought me to this country.<br> What he has asked me to do I have<br> because I was grateful.<br> It was not because<br> he was your husband and you loved him?<br> I never loved him.<br> It was gratitude, then,<br> that prompted you to give him an alibi<br> - in your statement to the police?<br> - That is it. Exactly.<br> - But now you think it was wrong to do so.<br> - Because it is murder.<br> That woman, she was a harmless old fool,<br> and he makes of me<br> an accomplice to the murder.<br> I cannot come into court and swear that<br> he was with me at the time it was done.<br> I cannot do it! I cannot do it!<br> Then this is the truth?<br> That Leonard Vole returned<br> that night at ten minutes past ten,<br> he had blood on the sleeves of his coat,<br> and that he said to you<br> "I have killed her"?<br> That is the truth.<br> That is the truth, before God?<br> That is the truth.<br> Thank you.<br> Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm,<br> which do you prefer to be called?<br> - It does not matter.<br> - Does it not?<br> In this country we are inclined to take<br> a rather more serious view of marriage.<br> However, it would appear that when<br> you first met the prisoner in Hamburg<br> - you lied to him about your marital status.<br> - I wanted to get out of Germany, so...<br> You lied, did you not?<br> Just yes or no, please.<br> - Yes.<br> - Thank you.<br> And in arranging the marriage,<br> you lied to the authorities?<br> I, um, did not tell the truth<br> to the authorities.<br> - You lied to them?<br> - Yes.<br> And in the ceremony, when you swore<br> to love, honour and cherish your husband,<br> - that too was a lie?<br> - Yes.<br> And when the police questioned you<br> about this wretched man<br> who believed himself married and loved,<br> - you told them...<br> - I told them what he wanted me to.<br> You told them that he was at home<br> with you at 25 minutes past 9,<br> - and now you say that that was a lie?<br> - Yes, a lie!<br> And when you said that he had<br> accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?<br> - Yes!<br> - And today you told a new story entirely.<br> The question is, Frau Helm,<br> were you lying then, are you lying now?<br> Or are you not, in fact,<br> a chronic and habitual liar?!<br> (murmuring)<br> (coughs)<br> Carter, Carter!<br> The other pill. Under the tongue.<br> My lord, is my learned friend to be<br> allowed to bully and insult the witness?<br> Mr Myers, this is a capital charge<br> and, within the bounds of reason,<br> I should like the defence<br> to have every latitude.<br> My lord, may I also<br> remind my learned friend<br> that his witness, by her own admission,<br> has already violated so many oaths<br> that I am surprised the Testament<br> did not leap from her hand<br> when she was sworn here today.<br> I doubt if anything is to be gained<br> by questioning you any further.<br> That will be all, Frau Helm.<br> (muttering)<br> Mrs Helm, I presume you know the<br> meaning of the English word "perjury"?<br> - In German, the word is Meineid.<br> - Yes. Meineid.<br> It means to swear falsely under oath.<br> And are you aware, Mrs Helm,<br> that the penalty in this country for perjury<br> is a heavy term of imprisonment?<br> Yes, I'm aware.<br> Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,<br> is the evidence that you have given<br> the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth?<br> So help me, God.<br> Then that, my lord,<br> is the case for the prosecution.<br> - Want a tissue?<br> - Yes, thanks.<br> It's the first murder trial<br> I've ever been to. It's terrible.<br> Silence.<br> Sir Wilfrid.<br> Are you ready for the defence?<br> My lord, members of the jury,<br> the prosecution has very ably presented<br> against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,<br> a case with the most overwhelming<br> circumstantial evidence.<br> Among the witnesses you have heard<br> Chief Inspector Hearne,<br> who has given his testimony in a fair<br> and impartial manner, as he always does.<br> He has put before you a clever theory<br> of how this crime was committed.<br> Whether it is theory<br> or actual fact, however,<br> you will decide for yourselves.<br> And then you have heard<br> the evidence of Janet McKenzie,<br> a worthy and devoted housekeeper who<br> has suffered two most grievous losses.<br> One, the death of her beloved mistress<br> and, second, in being deprived<br> of an inheritance of? 80,000,<br> which she'd fully expected to receive.<br> I will not comment<br> further on her evidence,<br> but will express only<br> my deepest sympathy for her<br> in both these... mishaps.<br> And most damaging of all, the prosecution<br> has produced a surprise witness,<br> one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner<br> brought from the rubble of her homeland<br> to the safety of this country, giving her<br> his love and the protection of his name.<br> I objected to her testimony<br> because a wife cannot give evidence<br> harmful to her husband.<br> But it has been proven that her marriage<br> to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.<br> Therefore, her evidence must be admitted<br> and you must consider it.<br> For what it is worth.<br> Such is the prosecution's case.<br> Now it is the turn of the defence.<br> We could present, on behalf of<br> the prisoner, witnesses to his character,<br> his war record, the lack of criminal<br> or evil association in his past.<br> However, only one witness<br> can shed new light<br> on this tragic riddle.<br> The prisoner himself.<br> Members of the jury,<br> I call Leonard Stephen Vole.<br> I swear by Almighty God<br> that the evidence I give will be the truth,<br> - the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<br> - No.<br> - Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?<br> - It is.<br> - Where do live?<br> - 620 Edgware Road.<br> Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did<br> you not on the night of October 14 last,<br> murder Emily Jane French?<br> - I did not.<br> - Thank you, that will be all.<br> (muttering)<br> Have you, in fact, concluded your<br> examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?<br> The prisoner has endured three days<br> of profound mental agony and shock.<br> The defence feels<br> his faculties should be spared<br> for the cross-examination<br> by my learned friend for the prosecution.<br> This is not a plea for any indulgence.<br> I am confident that<br> no matter how searching this may be,<br> the prisoner will withstand it.<br> At the time you made the acquaintance<br> of Mrs French, were you employed?<br> - No, sir.<br> - How much money did you have?<br> - A few pounds.<br> - Did she give you any?<br> No.<br> - Did you expect to receive any?<br> - No, sir.<br> Did you know that in her new will,<br> you were the beneficiary of? 80,000?<br> No, I didn't.<br> Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit<br> Mrs French for the last time,<br> did you wear a trench coat<br> and a brown hat?<br> - Yes, I did.<br> - Was it this coat and hat?<br> Yes, sir.<br> My lord, the defence, in its efforts<br> to establish an alibi for the prisoner,<br> circulated this photograph,<br> hoping to bring forth a witness<br> who had seen him leaving<br> Mrs French's house or entering his own<br> at the times that he has stated.<br> Apparently, this splendid effort<br> was without results.<br> However, the defence<br> will be pleased to learn<br> that, at the last moment,<br> a witness has come forward,<br> and that the prisoner had been<br> seen wearing this coat and this hat.<br> Lamentably, he had not been seen on the<br> night of the murder but one week before.<br> On the afternoon of October 8, were you<br> not in a travel agency in Regent Street?<br> And did you not make inquiries about<br> prices and schedules of foreign cruises?<br> Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?<br> Not at all. Many people go on a cruise<br> when they can afford to pay for it.<br> - But you couldn't pay for it, could you?<br> - Well, I was hard up. I told you that.<br> And yet you came to this particular<br> travel agency with a clinging brunette?<br> A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?<br> My lord, the lady was so described to me.<br> She was very affectionate with the<br> prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.<br> Oh.<br> You then admit that you made inquiries<br> about expensive and luxurious cruises?<br> How did you expect<br> to pay for such a thing?<br> - I don't know. It was...<br> - If you don't know, perhaps I can help.<br> On the morning of the very same day,<br> you heard Mrs French change her will,<br> - leaving you the bulk of her money.<br> - I didn't!<br> And in the afternoon,<br> you started plans to dispose of it.<br> No! It was nothing of the kind.<br> I was in a pub and I met a girl.<br> I don't even remember her name.<br> We had a drink and walked out together.<br> We passed the window and saw the fancy<br> posters, all blue seas and palm trees.<br> The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went<br> in for fun and I started asking for folders.<br> Well, the man gave me a funny look<br> because I did look a bit shabby.<br> Anyway, it irritated me,<br> so I kept asking for the swankiest tours,<br> all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck,<br> but it was just an act!<br> An act? You knew that in a week<br> you were going to inherit? 80,000!<br> No! It wasn't that way at all.<br> It was make-believe and childish but...<br> it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought<br> of killing anyone or inheriting any money.<br> It's just a coincidence that Mrs French<br> should be killed only one week later?<br> I told you! I didn't kill her!<br> Do you know any reason why Christine<br> Helm should give the evidence she has<br> - if it were not true?<br> - No. I don't know why my wife...<br> I don't know why I still call her my wife.<br> She must be lying or out of her mind.<br> She seemed remarkably<br> sane and self-possessed.<br> - But insanity is all you can suggest?<br> - I don't understand it.<br> Oh, God! What's happened?<br> What's changed her?<br> Very effective, I'm sure.<br> But in this court we deal with fact.<br> And the fact, Mr Vole,<br> is that we've only your word for it.<br> That you left Mrs French's house<br> at the time you say,<br> that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes<br> past 9, and that you did not go out again!<br> Somebody must have seen me<br> in the street or going in the house!<br> One would think so. But the only person<br> who did see you come home that night<br> says it was ten past ten<br> and that you had blood on your hands.<br> - I cut my wrist!<br> - You cut your wrist deliberately!<br> No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.<br> But you make it sound as though I did.<br> I can hear it myself.<br> You came home at ten past ten!<br> No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.<br> You've got to believe me!<br> You killed Emily French!<br> No, I didn't! I didn't do it!<br> I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!<br> God, it's like a nightmare.<br> Some ghastly, horrible dream.<br> Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.<br> How did it go today?<br> Oh, Sir Wilfrid.<br> I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've<br> brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.<br> What?<br> - You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.<br> - I'm in the middle of a murder trial.<br> It'll all be over by the afternoon,<br> and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.<br> You work it out. You know my shape,<br> you've stabbed it often enough.<br> Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath<br> and your calcium injection.<br> And there's a lot more packing to be done.<br> It's ridiculous having boat reservations.<br> The jury may be out for days.<br> Not on this case, I'm afraid.<br> It seems too open-and-shut.<br> I watched when Frau Helm<br> was on the stand. They didn't like her.<br> No, but they believed her. They liked<br> Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.<br> And that travel agency business<br> doesn't help either. Cigar?<br> No.<br> - Wilfrid, do you think she lied?<br> - Well, don't you?<br> I'm not sure.<br> I am. She lied. Whether she calls it<br> Meineid or perjury, she lied.<br> The only question is why. What's<br> her game? What is she up to? What?<br> I hope that in your final speech you<br> won't become too emotionally involved.<br> - You must think of your condition.<br> - He's right.<br> I want to see you save yourself.<br> This isn't going to be your last case.<br> Yes, it is. But until it's over,<br> I'm still a barrister.<br> My client's life is at stake.<br> That's all that matters - his life.<br> He's entitled to the best that I can do.<br> If I can't stand up to make my final appeal<br> for him, I'll make it sitting down.<br> If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,<br> or two pills, or all of them and the box too.<br> (telephone rings)<br> - Yes?<br> - (woman) This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?<br> - Well, yes, it is.<br> - Let me talk to the old geezer.<br> - Who is this speaking, please?<br> - Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.<br> I'm afraid that's impossible.<br> What is the nature of your business?<br> It's business all right.<br> I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.<br> Well, really, madam!<br> And what I want to sell 'im,<br> believe me, 'e'll want to buy.<br> - It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.<br> - Leonard Vole?<br> It's about that German wife.<br> I've got the goods on her and it's for sale.<br> This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.<br> Now, what is this all about?<br> Well, hello, ducky.<br> What is this you said<br> about Mrs Leonard Vole?<br> I'm not just saying.<br> I've got it in black and white.<br> - You've got what?<br> - Listen to this carefully, ducks.<br> I'm at the buffet at Euston Station<br> at the far end of the bar.<br> I'll be here for 30 minutes<br> because that's when me train leaves.<br> If you want the lowdown on<br> that German bag, get yourself here.<br> What lowdown?<br> What do you know about her?<br> Uh-uh. Not on the phone.<br> You'd better get on over here,<br> and bring plenty of money.<br> Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?<br> That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.<br> You get those in every murder trial.<br> Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in<br> Balderdash.<br> I'm too old and too sick<br> to go on a wild-goose chase.<br> - Come on, Mayhew.<br> - Where to, Sir Wilfrid?<br> Euston Station, where do you think?<br> Now, sir?<br> Shortly.<br> Cigar!<br> Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?<br> Your bath, your massage,<br> your dinner, your injection!<br> Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.<br> (train announcement on PA)<br> - You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?<br> - I would.<br> Didn't recognise you without your wig.<br> Lovely you all look in them wigs.<br> Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.<br> This is Mr Mayhew,<br> Leonard Vole's solicitor.<br> - Well, that's all right, then.<br> - And your name, please?<br> No need for mine. If I did give you a name<br> it mightn't be the right one, might it?<br> 'Ave a drink, boys.<br> Two whiskies for me gen'lmen friends.<br> Now what is this information<br> you allegedly have?<br> You realise that you're duty-bound<br> to give any evidence that you might have?<br> - Come off it. Did you bring any money?<br> - What is it you have, madam?<br> Letters. Letters that German wife<br> of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.<br> - Letters written to the prisoner?<br> - To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.<br> Poor bleeder, he's been took in<br> by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.<br> If we could see these letters, we could<br> advise you as to how pertinent they are.<br> Well, I don't expect you...<br> Well, as I say, I don't expect you<br> to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.<br> If these letters get the boy off,<br> it's? 100 for me, right?<br> If these letters contain information useful<br> to the defence, I'm prepared to offer? 10.<br> What? Ten bleeding pounds<br> for letters like these?<br> Take that piece of glass<br> out o' yer eye. Good night.<br> If these help prove my client's innocence,<br> ? 20 should, I think, not be an<br> unreasonable sum for your expenses.<br> That's if you're satisfied with 'em.<br> - ? 40.<br> - All right, blast yer.<br> 'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.<br> How do we know<br> these are from Mrs Vole?<br> Oh, she wrote 'em all right.<br> It's all fair an' square.<br> I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.<br> I've had messages from Mrs Vole.<br> It looks like her handwriting.<br> Good heavens, look at this.<br> Juicy, ain't they?<br> - There's one that's even better.<br> - How did you get hold of these?<br> What's the difference<br> so long as she gets what's coming?<br> - What have you got against her?<br> - Ha!<br> I'll give you something<br> to dream about, mister.<br> Want to kiss me, ducky?<br> Ha!<br> - I didn't suppose you would.<br> - Christine Vole did that to you?<br> Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was<br> a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.<br> Then she come along, started seeing 'im<br> on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.<br> I found 'em together. I said what I thought<br> of 'er and he cut me face up proper.<br> - Did you go to the police about it?<br> - Who, me? Not likely.<br> It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im<br> away from me, turnin' 'im against me.<br> But I waited me time to pay 'er back.<br> And it's come now.<br> I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.<br> We'll make it another? 5 for the letters.<br> 'Olding out on me, were yer?<br> I knew I was being soft with yer.<br> Cold-blooded vindictiveness.<br> Read this one.<br> Unbelievable.<br> We'd better have the full name of the man<br> to whom these were addressed, Miss...<br> Miss, um...<br> Where is she?<br> On that train, I should think. Doesn't want<br> her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.<br> - Care for another, sir?<br> - Hm?<br> Good idea.<br> (gavel)<br> Silence!<br> Be upstanding in court.<br> All persons who have anything<br> to do before my lords,<br> the queen's justices of oyer and terminer<br> and general jail delivery for the<br> jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,<br> draw near and give your attendance.<br> God save the queen.<br> Since the defence has called<br> but one witness, the prisoner,<br> it has the right to be heard last.<br> Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have<br> the final address for the prosecution.<br> My lord, members of the jury,<br> I will be brief in my final speech<br> because I think we've proved so obvious<br> a case of murder against Leonard Vole,<br> that a verdict of guilty<br> must be the only possible conclusion.<br> - I will briefly summarise these facts...<br> - (footsteps)<br> You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.<br> That is, if Sir Wilfrid<br> is at all interested in our proceedings.<br> I am, indeed, my lord. The speech<br> for the crown, however, is premature.<br> I ask that the case for the defence be<br> reopened. And that a witness be recalled.<br> I most strenuously object to the case<br> being reopened at this final stage.<br> Evidence of a startling nature<br> has come into my possession.<br> The course my learned friend<br> proposes is quite unprecedented.<br> I have anticipated this objection<br> and can meet it with ample precedent.<br> There is the king vs Stillman, reported<br> in the criminal appeal reports of 1926<br> at page 463.<br> Also, the king vs Porter in volume one<br> of the king's bench division reports,<br> And lastly there is the case<br> of the king vs Sullivan<br> in which this issue was raised, which<br> I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,<br> since you appeared for the prosecution.<br> I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.<br> What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?<br> Letters, my lord.<br> Letters written by Christine Helm.<br> My lord, the prosecution<br> continues its objection.<br> If my memory serves me well,<br> Your Lordship's similar objection<br> in the king against Sullivan<br> was sustained.<br> Your memory, for once,<br> serves you ill, Mr Myers.<br> My objection then was overruled<br> by Mr Justice Swindon.<br> As yours is now, by me.<br> (muttering)<br> Call Christine Helm.<br> Christine Helm.<br> - Christine Helm.<br> - Christine Helm.<br> If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I<br> wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.<br> Mrs Helm, you appreciate<br> you are still under oath?<br> Yes.<br> - Do you know a man named Max?<br> - I don't know what you mean.<br> It's a simple question. Do you<br> or do you not know a man called Max?<br> Max? Certainly not.<br> It's a fairly common name and yet<br> you've never known a man named Max?<br> In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.<br> I shall not ask you to go back that far.<br> Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.<br> - What have you got there?<br> - A letter.<br> I suggest that on October 20<br> - you wrote a letter...<br> - I don't know what you're talking about.<br> ...addressed to a man named Max.<br> - I did nothing of the sort.<br> The letter was but one of a series<br> written to the same man.<br> Lies! All lies!<br> You seem to have been, well, let us say,<br> on intimate terms with this man.<br> How dare you say a thing like that?<br> It isn't true!<br> I'm not concerned with the general trend<br> of this correspondence, only one letter.<br> "My beloved Max,<br> an extraordinary thing has happened."<br> "I believe all our difficulties<br> may be ended."<br> I will not stand here<br> and listen to a pack of lies!<br> That letter's a forgery.<br> It isn't even my letter paper!<br> - It isn't?<br> - No!<br> I write my letters on small blue paper<br> with my initials on it.<br> Like this?<br> (muttering)<br> This is a bill from my tailor for a pair<br> of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.<br> (laughter)<br> Wilfrid the fox! That's what we call him<br> and that's what he is.<br> Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough<br> to identify your letter paper.<br> Now, if you like, I can have an expert<br> identify your handwriting.<br> Damn you!<br> - Damn you!<br> - Leave her alone!<br> - Damn you!<br> - Mrs Helm!<br> Let me go!<br> Let me get out of here! Let me go!<br> - Mrs Helm!<br> - Let me go!<br> Usher, get the witness a chair.<br> (Christine sobs)<br> Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter<br> in question so that the jury may hear it?<br> "My beloved Max,<br> an extraordinary thing has happened."<br> "All our difficulties may soon be solved."<br> "Leonard is suspected of murdering<br> the old lady I told you about."<br> "His only hope of an alibi<br> depends on me and me alone."<br> "Suppose I testify that he was not at home<br> with me at the time of the murder,<br> that he came home<br> with blood on his sleeves,<br> and that he even admitted to me<br> that he'd killed her?"<br> "Strange that he always said<br> he would never let me leave him."<br> "But now, if this succeeds,<br> he will be leaving me<br> because they will take him away forever<br> and I shall be free and yours,<br> my beloved."<br> "I count the hours until<br> we are together. Christine."<br> Mrs Helm?<br> Will you go back to the witness box?<br> I now ask you again, Christine Helm,<br> did you write this letter?<br> Christine, tell him you didn't write it.<br> I know you didn't.<br> Please answer my question.<br> Did you write this letter?<br> Before answering, Mrs Helm,<br> I wish to warn you that the law regarding<br> perjury in this country is very severe.<br> If you have already<br> committed perjury in this courtroom,<br> I strongly advise you<br> not to add to your crime.<br> But, if this letter<br> has not been written by you,<br> then now is the time to state this fact.<br> I wrote the letter.<br> (muttering)<br> And that, my lord,<br> is the case for the defence.<br> I keep asking which is harder,<br> your head or your arteries?<br> Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.<br> We're all packed and ready.<br> I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.<br> I concede.<br> - Congratulations, here are your cigars.<br> - Not yet.<br> Come on, it's all over,<br> wrapped up neat and tidy.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - It's a little too neat, too tidy,<br> and altogether too symmetrical,<br> that's what's wrong with it.<br> - The jury is back.<br> - You're not worried about the verdict?<br> It's not their judgment<br> that worries me, it's mine.<br> Come along.<br> Where's my wig?<br> The prisoner will stand up.<br> Members of the jury,<br> are you all agreed upon your verdict?<br> We are.<br> Do you find the prisoner at the bar,<br> Leonard Stephen Vole,<br> guilty or not guilty<br> of the murder of Emily Jane French?<br> Not guilty, m'lord.<br> (shouting / gasping)<br> Silence!<br> Silence!<br> Leonard Stephen Vole,<br> you have been found not guilty<br> of the murder<br> of Emily Jane French on October 14.<br> You are hereby discharged<br> and are free to leave the court.<br> Persons with anything more to do<br> before the queen's justices<br> of oyer and terminer and jail delivery<br> for the jurisdiction of the Central<br> Criminal Court may depart the area.<br> Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.<br> Thank you, Mr Mayhew.<br> Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.<br> Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.<br> You were wonderful.<br> - I'd say we were lucky all around.<br> - Yeah.<br> I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,<br> Mr Vole, and we can release you.<br> "Mr Vole." They didn't call me Mr<br> when they charged me.<br> - I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.<br> - Let's go before they change their mind!<br> Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,<br> he had one foot on the gallows<br> and the other on a banana peel.<br> You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.<br> Aren't you?<br> Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows,<br> but there's still that banana peel<br> somewhere, under somebody's foot.<br> (commotion)<br> - (woman) Every word you said was a lie!<br> - (man) You ought to be locked up! Liar!<br> You'd better wait here<br> until we get rid of that crowd, madam.<br> Thank you.<br> Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.<br> Let me finish the last of the cocoa<br> while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.<br> Would you excuse me,<br> Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.<br> I never thought you British could get<br> so emotional. Especially in public.<br> - I apologise for my compatriots.<br> - It's all right.<br> I don't mind being called names or<br> pushed around or even kicked in the shin.<br> But I have a ladder<br> in my last pair of nylons.<br> In case you are not familiar with<br> our prison regulations, no silk stockings.<br> Prison? Will I go to prison?<br> You heard the judge.<br> You will certainly be charged with perjury,<br> - tried for it, and to prison you shall go.<br> - Well, it won't be for life, will it?<br> If I were appearing<br> for the prosecution, it would be.<br> You loathe me, don't you?<br> Like the people outside.<br> What a wicked woman I am,<br> and how brilliantly you exposed me<br> and saved Leonard's life.<br> The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.<br> Well, let me tell you something.<br> You didn't do it alone. You had help.<br> What are you driving at?<br> I'm not driving at anything.<br> Leonard is free and we did it.<br> - We?<br> - Remember?<br> When you said that no jury would<br> believe an alibi given by a loving wife,<br> no matter how much she swore<br> he was innocent? That gave me the idea.<br> What idea?<br> The idea that I should be a witness, not<br> for my husband, but for the prosecution.<br> That I should swear Leonard was guilty<br> and that you should expose me as a liar<br> because only then would they believe<br> Leonard was innocent.<br> So now you know<br> the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.<br> I'll give yer something<br> to dream about, mister.<br> Want to kiss me, ducky?<br> I suspected something, but not that.<br> - Never that!<br> - Thank you for the compliment.<br> It's been a long time since I acted<br> and I never played such a vital role.<br> All those blue letters!<br> It took me hours to write them,<br> to invent Max. There never was a Max.<br> There's never been anyone but Leonard.<br> My dear, could you not have trusted me,<br> worked with me truthfully<br> and honourably? We would have won.<br> I could not run that risk.<br> You thought he was innocent.<br> And you knew he was innocent.<br> I understand.<br> No, Sir Wilfrid,<br> you do not understand at all.<br> I knew he was guilty.<br> That can't be true! No!<br> Listen to me, once and for all.<br> He came home after ten,<br> he had blood on his sleeves,<br> he said he had killed the woman,<br> only I could save him. He pleaded.<br> And you saved him? A murderer?<br> Again, you don't understand.<br> I love him.<br> I told you she was an actress.<br> And a good one.<br> Leonard!<br> I knew she'd do something,<br> but I just didn't know what or how.<br> Leonard, Leonard.<br> - Fooled you completely, didn't she?<br> - It was you, Vole, who fooled me.<br> Oh, easy. Easy. We both got<br> out of this alive, let's stay this way.<br> - Where are your pills?<br> - You've made a mockery of English law.<br> Who did? You got me off<br> and I can't be tried again for this.<br> - That's English law too, isn't it?<br> - You can't touch him now. Nobody can.<br> The scales of justice<br> may tip one way or another,<br> but ultimately they balance out.<br> You'll pay for this.<br> Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather<br> pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.<br> Suppose we double your fee? There'll be<br> lots of money once the will goes through.<br> I'm not cheap, I want everybody<br> to get something out of it.<br> There's Janet McKenzie.<br> We'll get her that new hearing aid.<br> And we'll get you a new one of these.<br> And when they try you for perjury<br> there'll be? 5,000 for the defence.<br> I don't care, just so we'll be together.<br> You don't know what I've been through.<br> Standing in the witness box, having<br> to face you, saying I never loved you.<br> What is it, Leonard?<br> The luggage is in the car and we've<br> only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.<br> This is a nice young lady<br> I met during the trial.<br> Len!<br> Oh, Len!<br> Len...<br> Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep<br> me away. It's had me nearly crazy.<br> Leonard, who's this girl?<br> I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.<br> Tell her, Len.<br> Leonard, is this the girl<br> who was with you in the travel bureau?<br> The girl you said you hardly knew,<br> didn't even know her name?<br> That's right. That's who I am and I know<br> all about you. You're not his wife.<br> Never have been. You're years older than<br> he is. We've been together for months<br> and we're going away on a cruise,<br> just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.<br> - Yes, Len, tell me yourself.<br> - All right, Diana, come along.<br> You can't, not after what I've done.<br> I won't let you.<br> I saved your life<br> getting you out of Germany,<br> you got me out of this mess,<br> so we're even. It's over now.<br> Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!<br> Don't, Leonard! Don't!<br> Pull yourself together.<br> They'll have you up for perjury.<br> Don't make it worse<br> or they'll try you as an accessory.<br> And you know what that means.<br> I don't care. Let them. Let them try me<br> for perjury, or an accessory, or...<br> - Ready?<br> - Or better yet...<br> let them try me for...!<br> Argh!<br> (Diana screams)<br> (sobs)<br> - Call a doctor.<br> - It's no use. No doctor can help now.<br> - What happened?<br> - She killed him.<br> Killed him?<br> She executed him.<br> Carter, what have you done<br> with the luggage?<br> I sent it on ahead to the station,<br> and I've got a cab waiting outside.<br> - A remarkable woman.<br> - You can just barely catch the boat train.<br> Better bring the luggage back,<br> and you can dismiss the cab.<br> We are not going yet, are we?<br> Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.<br> Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers,<br> and Mayhew too.<br> We're appearing for the defence<br> in the trial of Christine Vole.<br> Sir Wilfrid?<br> You've forgotten your brandy.<br> The management of this theatre suggests<br> that for the greater entertainment of<br> friends who have not yet seen the picture,<br> you will not divulge to anyone<br> the secret of the ending<br> of "Witness For The Prosecution".<br>
