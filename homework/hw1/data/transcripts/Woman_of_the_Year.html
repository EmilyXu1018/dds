                        Miss Harding and Mr. Kieran<br> both have their hands up.<br> - Full title.<br> - "Nights in the Garden..."<br> - Hello, Sam.<br> - Hi, kid.<br> Hi, Sammy. You missed most<br> of the Information Please!<br> I guess I have lived around a lot.<br> With my father, that is.<br> Tess Harding. Treat for the intellect.<br> Rest your intellect and give me<br> a Scotch and water.<br> The Chronicle ought to form<br> a cheering section for her.<br> Because we write on the same paper?<br> Did you ever meet her, Sam?<br> I understand she don't talk if you<br> haven't signed a nonaggression pact.<br> Prescott lists four seaports...<br> ... which have had great<br> strategic importance in this war:<br> Dakar, Narvik, Derna and Singapore.<br> Were any of these ever under<br> the American flag?<br> Derna, in 1803.<br> - The war with Barbary pirates.<br> - Right. Most of us...<br> Can you figure a dame that knew<br> what was going on in Libya in 1803?<br> Fadiman says she's number-two dame,<br> next to Mrs. Roosevelt.<br> So they're giving them numbers now,<br> like public enemies.<br> Well, Mrs. Prescott does not receive<br> $ 25 and a set of the Britannica.<br> The next question comes from<br> Mr. C.A. Copeland of Glenport, Florida.<br> What is the most frequently run<br> distance in American sports?<br> - Hundred yards.<br> - No, no. It's a mile, counting horses.<br> I'll try our guest expert first.<br> Miss Harding.<br> Ninety feet, sister.<br> I really don 't know anything<br> about American sports.<br> Mr. Kieran?<br> - Ninety feet.<br> - Care to explain?<br> The distance between<br> home plate and first base.<br> Yes, or between any of the bases<br> in the game of baseball.<br> Thousands of men and boys<br> run it every day.<br> Really? Seems like<br> a frightful waste of energy.<br> There's an awful lot of energy<br> wasted in the world these days.<br> That's telling her, John.<br> - Isn 't anything more wasteful<br> than war.<br> However, all the more reason<br> people ought to give it their full attention.<br> What would you suggest,<br> Miss Harding?<br> Abolish baseball for the duration<br> of the emergency?<br> I think that's a very good idea.<br> - Have I said something wrong?<br> - Just a minute...<br> - Things they let them get away with.<br> - Maybe she was kidding.<br> She knew what she was saying.<br> Know what that does?<br> Take it easy, Sam.<br> Don't blow your top.<br> We're concerned with a threat to<br> what we call our American way of life.<br> Baseball and what it represents<br> is part of that way of life.<br> What's the sense of abolishing<br> what you're trying to protect?<br> That's a beautiful thought, Sammy.<br> - You ought to write a poem about it.<br> - I'll do better than that.<br> "...and she might remember what the<br> Duke of Wellington said about sports.<br> The duke was the baby<br> who whipped Napoleon at Waterloo...<br> ...and made an ex-champ out of him.<br> After it was all over, the duke let out<br> that the battle was really won...<br> ...on the playing fields of Eton."<br> What?<br> Well, that's about all, Miss Harding,<br> except at the end he calls you:<br> "The Calamity Jane<br> of the fast international set."<br> Yes, Miss Harding.<br> I've got my pad right here.<br> Ready. Yes.<br> "Mr. Craig cites Wellington's<br> observation concerning Waterloo.<br> I assume his purpose is to demonstrate<br> that at one time or another...<br> ...he was subjected to<br> a grammar-school course in history.<br> Naturally, Mr. Craig doesn't realize<br> times have changed since Waterloo."<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - What do you think?<br> Swing with both hands.<br> We men have only ourselves to blame.<br> Women should be kept illiterate<br> and clean, like canaries.<br> Hello? Yes.<br> Oh, yes, Mr. Clayton.<br> Yes, sir. Yes, I'll be right up.<br> - She's waiting for you.<br> - Thanks.<br> Come in, Sam. Come in.<br> - Haven't you met Miss Harding?<br> - Yes, in a belligerent sort of way.<br> - He hit me first. Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Now, fellows, I realize as much<br> as anybody that controversy...<br> ...is a very stimulating thing. Very.<br> I encourage it when someone<br> on the paper gets into a good fight...<br> ...over an important issue. Always.<br> But not intramural fights. Never.<br> It's my job to think in terms<br> of the paper as a whole.<br> I'm dead sure that it just doesn't<br> do any one of us any good...<br> ...for one department to rap another.<br> To come directly to the point, I'd like<br> to see you drop this business right away.<br> How about it, Sam?<br> You ready to kiss and make up?<br> I'll kiss. I don't know about making up.<br> - How about you, Tess? Wiling to quit?<br> - Sure.<br> - Okay?<br> - Fine, thank you.<br> I'm always delighted to quit<br> when I'm losing.<br> Glad to be able to reconcile<br> you two. Very glad.<br> Cooperation is the essence<br> of efficient organization.<br> The essence.<br> Sorry.<br> Isn't the sports department<br> downstairs?<br> Why, yes, yes. I guess it is, but I...<br> Then aren't you going<br> in the wrong direction?<br> Well, maybe I am. I...<br> Are you always much too busy?<br> What for?<br> - I was wondering about this afternoon.<br> - Sorry.<br> Tomorrow afternoon, maybe?<br> What's on your mind?<br> I'd like to take you to a baseball game.<br> Okay.<br> Are all these people unemployed?<br> No, they're all attending<br> their grandmother's funeral.<br> - He's got Tess Harding with him.<br> - Where's your manners?<br> No women in the press box.<br> A rule as old as baseball.<br> - No women.<br> - So what?<br> She's a newspaperman,<br> and she's pretty. Hi, Sam.<br> I haven't seen it happen in 20 years.<br> Worst scandal since the Black Sox.<br> - Phil, I want you to meet Miss...<br> - Harding, I know. How do you do?<br> Chronicle.<br> You mean our paper sends<br> two men to cover one game?<br> No. I cover the game,<br> he kicks it around in his column.<br> - We've only got one man at Vichy.<br> - Vichy? Are they still in the league?<br> Who's pitching?<br> The hat.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey, buddy, tell her it ain't raining.<br> Fella wanted me to tell you<br> that it ain't raining.<br> - Who's playing today?<br> - The Athletics and the Yanks.<br> The Athletics will bat first, you see,<br> and after they've made three outs...<br> ...then the Yanks come to bat.<br> I see. Then they have to make<br> the same number of outs.<br> That's right. That's right.<br> And each team has nine innings.<br> But wouldn't it always come out even<br> if they made the same number of outs?<br> No, no, no. You see...<br> You see, an out... An out is...<br> Well, it's just an out.<br> - Come on! Play ball!<br> - Play ball!<br> Okay.<br> Now, there's the first batter.<br> Now, he's gonna try to hit the ball<br> as far as he can...<br> ...and get around as many bases<br> as he can.<br> If he could get around all the bases<br> and back to home plate...<br> ...that would mean a run for his team.<br> The pitcher's gonna try<br> to make him miss it.<br> - Which one is the pitcher?<br> - The one pitch...<br> The fellow in the middle.<br> One out.<br> No. No, one strike. That's a strike.<br> Two more of those before he's out.<br> - Why?<br> - Well, because it's... Are you kidding?<br> How could that be a strike?<br> He didn't even swing at it.<br> Well, he doesn't have to swing at it.<br> You see, it's a strike as long<br> as he puts it over the plate...<br> ...between the batter's<br> shoulders and his knees.<br> I see. If the batter were really smart,<br> he'd stoop down and fool the pitcher.<br> I'll bet you this next one's<br> a double upcurve in the side pocket.<br> Yeah. Maybe he'll hit<br> into a quadruple play.<br> Do you think he will?<br> Wouldn't surprise me a bit.<br> Safe? He's out a mile!<br> How much are they paying you,<br> you one-eyed chiseler?<br> What do you do in the winter,<br> burn down hospitals? Grave robber!<br> - Ain't there no laws in this country?<br> - Shut up, will you?<br> What do you mean, shut up?<br> You got a lot of nerve.<br> That guy was out a mile. By six miles!<br> I'll beef all I like!<br> You'd think I didn't buy a ticket.<br> Well, I did. You wanna see it? Here!<br> $ 1.65 of good American dough.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Took his foot off the base,<br> and he's claiming he didn't.<br> Got as much right here as anybody. More<br> than most, because I'm here all the time.<br> Ask the usher, the ticket office.<br> First in line at the opening game.<br> - If the shortstop had kept his...<br> I mean, if the short...<br> Maybe I could draw you<br> a diagram of it here a little.<br> - Come on, Joe!<br> - Come on, Joe!<br> - Two on, two out.<br> - Have a peanut.<br> Thanks. A homer would win<br> the game, wouldn't it?<br> - Nothing less.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - You're wonderful.<br> - Of course. Didn't you know?<br> I had you mixed up.<br> What is your name again?<br> - Just call me Tessie.<br> - Hi, Tessie. Call me Sammy.<br> - Come on, Joe!<br> - Come on!<br> Run!<br> - Well, we win.<br> - No.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - He's out. That's the end of the inning.<br> - The score is tied?<br> - Like a wet shoelace.<br> What a shame. We almost won.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> - Wait, the game isn't over.<br> - You said nine innings.<br> At the end of nine innings, if the score<br> is tied, they play until somebody wins.<br> - What time is it?<br> - 4:30.<br> I'm late already.<br> I've got a rehearsal at NBC.<br> You stay and finish. I'll be fine.<br> - So long.<br> - So long, pal.<br> - Wait, I'll go with you.<br> - Oh, please...<br> Looks like the ball game isn't<br> the only thing that's tied up around here.<br> Sounds like a hit. Two-bagger.<br> NBC, and hurry, please. 9:00.<br> I'm sorry, I must... I thought...<br> Looking for Miss Harding.<br> - Well, come right in.<br> - Is this Miss Harding's?<br> Yes. May I have your hat?<br> - Oh, I don't... I don't...<br> - Sam.<br> Sam, I'm so glad you came. Who won?<br> - Who won what?<br> - The game.<br> - The Yanks in the 10th.<br> - How nice.<br> Everyone in Philadelphia<br> must be so happy.<br> You dropped your flowers.<br> Thanks.<br> - Flowers.<br> - Sam, you're sweet.<br> Shall we pass them around again now?<br> Come on. A few people always<br> come in after my broadcast.<br> Why do you broadcast?<br> Just wait and tell them here.<br> Are they kidding<br> with that "da-da-da"?<br> You don't speak Russian,<br> they speak nothing else.<br> Now, let's see.<br> I wonder who you'd get along with.<br> There's Madame Laruga<br> sitting over there.<br> - Probably don't speak Slovenian either.<br> - No, just a little broken English.<br> Hello. Sam, will you excuse me?<br> He doesn't know anyone here.<br> How did Harry come out with that<br> Customs deal he was working on?<br> He didn't. I even went to the consul,<br> and he couldn't do anything.<br> - He stopped you?<br> - Absolutely.<br> - Why didn't you go the limit for Harry?<br> - I went to the Mexican authorities...<br> Dr. Livingstone, I presume.<br> Yes?<br> Yes. Sit down.<br> I get kind of lost at these big parties,<br> don't you?<br> Yes.<br> The situation is pretty warm<br> in your part of the world, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> - Having fun?<br> - Yes.<br> We haven't met. My name is Craig.<br> - What's yours?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> You don't speak English,<br> do you, Charlie?<br> Yes.<br> You're a silly-Iooking little jerk<br> with that towel around your head.<br> - You know that, don't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - That's all, brother.<br> - Yes.<br> Yes.<br> Yes.<br> Hey, ask her if it's true about<br> Rudolph Hess' toenails, will you?<br> I don't think we'll make a definite<br> reservation for the return flight.<br> Just a moment, please. Sorry.<br> Either tomorrow night<br> or Monday morning. Thank you.<br> - My name is Sam Craig. It's all right.<br> - Will you kindly be seated?<br> It'll just be a moment.<br> This is Gerald Howe,<br> Miss Harding's secretary, speaking.<br> I'd like to make a call<br> to Havana, Cuba.<br> Miss Harding calling the office<br> of Seor Batista.<br> Colonel Fulgencio Batista.<br> Just ask for the president<br> of the country. Right.<br> You read Chinese?<br> Fluently.<br> - You may go in now.<br> - Thanks.<br> Yes? Hold on a moment, please.<br> Cuba on the wire.<br> Nice party you had last night.<br> It was a nice baseball game.<br> - Thanks for the thing.<br> - Not at all.<br> I'd like to talk to you, Tess.<br> Shoot.<br> No, no. It's nothing in particular,<br> you know.<br> I thought the two of us<br> could sit down somewhere...<br> ...and kick the thing around.<br> I thought I'd have<br> a chance last night...<br> ...but when I walked into<br> the League of Nations...<br> ...with two sparrows under my arm...<br> They're lovebirds, Sam,<br> and they're wonderful.<br> How did they get here?<br> How the dickens do you think<br> they got here?<br> Get your hat, and we'll go<br> get lost in New Jersey.<br> I'd love to, Sam. But gosh darn it all!<br> I have to speak at a meeting<br> up at Riverside Hall this afternoon.<br> - Hey, pick me up after the meeting.<br> - All right. What time?<br> - About 5: 15. Meet me backstage?<br> - All right, 5...<br> Wait. I wonder if that'll<br> give me time. I have a 6:00 plane.<br> - Plane? What...?<br> - I'm going to Washington.<br> - Washington?<br> - Yeah. Sure it won't be inconvenient?<br> - To go to Washington?<br> - No, to take me to the airport, silly.<br> - No. Where do I pick you up?<br> - Riverside Hall.<br> Yes, hold on please.

I flew out.<br> - What time?<br> - 1:00.<br> - How long were you there?<br> - I left about 5:45.<br> - I got through about 5:30.<br> - We could've come home together.<br> - It didn't occur to me.<br> - There was so much...<br> - Why didn't it? It would to me.<br> I don't know why it's such an issue.<br> How could I have told you?<br> - Call the press box at Soldier's Field.<br> - I couldn't know that.<br> - Your whole point's about nothing.<br> - It's not whether we could have...<br> ...it's you never thought of it.<br> - How do you know?<br> - You just said you didn't.<br> Well, all right.<br> Yesterday, I wasn't anxious enough<br> to be with you.<br> So we're even.<br> How do you figure that out?<br> Because...<br> ...today you aren't anxious enough<br> to be with me.<br> If you were, you wouldn't waste<br> all this time arguing.<br> - Gonna put Red in?<br> - This is marvelous.<br> This is great being on the inside,<br> right on the player's bench.<br> You must have influence, Sam.<br> Hey, suppose I could work this sometime<br> when you're not around?<br> Where did I pick you up this morning?<br> Secretary of state's office?<br> - Sure. Why?<br> - I'm a man with influence.<br> - Where'd you play?<br> - Tackle.<br> - No, what college did you go to?<br> - I went to lots of colleges.<br> Have a chew?<br> Thanks.<br> Best I could find.<br> - The picture and the son-in-law.<br> - Thanks.<br> I'm gonna give you a treat.<br> Is that the stuff they carry around<br> in those political portfolios?<br> It'll dissolve an aspirin tablet<br> as quick as anything.<br> Thanks.<br> Know when I realized you're<br> the right man for my daughter?<br> - No, when?<br> - When I heard you'd asked her.<br> I felt whoever had the courage<br> to propose deserved to be her husband.<br> A privilege, I hasten to add, which I<br> don't underestimate in the slightest.<br> - It's a privilege.<br> - You're also the man...<br> ...who's responsible for making me<br> feel my age lately.<br> - Why?<br> - Nothing makes you feel your years...<br> ...so keenly as the sense<br> of being alone.<br> - There's no reason you can't see Tess.<br> - Oh, it's not that.<br> There were times she was miles away,<br> but I still felt, wherever she was...<br> ...she was my girl.<br> Now she's your girl. That makes me<br> admire your courage more than ever.<br> I once knew a woman who was<br> an even more difficult case than Tess.<br> If such a thing is possible.<br> Ellen?<br> That was an easy guess.<br> What happened?<br> Nothing happened. That's the point.<br> I don't know.<br> Just never seemed to be quite<br> the right moment.<br> Fifteen years of wrong moments.<br> Fifteen years of having what I've got<br> instead of what you've got.<br> What one courageous<br> moment can make.<br> I can't see that<br> what you've got is so little.<br> Well, let's look at the evidence.<br> I come back to this.<br> Unless I can think of an excuse not to.<br> But you go home to someone.<br> Someone to talk to, to live with.<br> - Share each other's work and ideas.<br> - Yeah.<br> Unless you've missed out on it, you're<br> apt to underestimate how important it is.<br> That other person existing who cares<br> as much about your interests as you do.<br> Yeah, it doesn't always<br> work out so perfectly.<br> Sam, it's a lucky thing you're not<br> a salesman. You'd starve to death.<br> Here's to the continued happiness<br> of both of you, Sam.<br> To the continued happiness<br> of both of us.<br> - What's the matter, somebody sick?<br> - Just because a wife waits up...<br> Darling, you must be tired. Hop into bed,<br> I'll fix you something to drink.<br> - I'm not thirsty.<br> - Help you sleep better.<br> Good morning.<br> I think I overslept.<br> Alma forgot to wake me.<br> You don't have to be there till afternoon.<br> I checked with your office.<br> Don't get up. It's silly to get up<br> if you don't have to.<br> Tess, what's all this about?<br> Breakfast.<br> All right, let's have it.<br> Well...<br> As a matter of fact, there is something<br> I'd like to talk to you about.<br> I figured that. What is it?<br> - Darling?<br> - What?<br> Are you...<br> ...perfectly...<br> ...satisfied about us?<br> What do you call being satisfied?<br> I mean, do you think that...<br> ...maybe there's a reason for the friction<br> we've been having lately?<br> Could be.<br> Do you think...<br> ...perhaps it's because...<br> ...there are only two of us?<br> What?<br> What would you think<br> about having a child?<br> Tess.<br> Tess, is that what this buildup is...?<br> Did you think I'd have to be<br> sold on the idea?<br> I thought I'd better get you<br> into the right frame of mind.<br> Get me into the right frame of... Me?<br> The sooner, the better.<br> It's already been done.<br> It's already been done. Well...<br> - Well, you gotta lie down. Go to...<br> - I'm all right, Sam.<br> Tess, but you've gotta be careful.<br> I'll have Mom come East for this.<br> She'll walk from Wisconsin for this.<br> What did the doctor say?<br> - I haven't seen the doctor.<br> - You've got to see the doctor.<br> You gotta stay off your feet,<br> you know...<br> Tess, I hope it's a boy.<br> - Oh, you sweet...<br> - It is a boy.<br> It is a boy? What...?<br> Well, how...? Who...?<br> He's... He's a refugee.<br> A little Greek refugee.<br> He's ours.<br> Two weeks ago, they made me chairman<br> of the Greek Refugee Committee.<br> I accepted without thinking much<br> about it.<br> While you were away,<br> they had a meeting.<br> And some idiot suggested<br> I should take the first one, so I did.<br> He thinks you don't like him.<br> - What's his name?<br> - Chris.<br> Sam, he's been to two baseball games<br> while he's been in New York...<br> ...and he simply loves it.<br> So you'll have lots to talk about.<br> When he learns to speak<br> a little English.<br> Hi, Chris.<br> Do you suppose we could<br> take him out with Alma?<br> - I'd like to talk to you.<br> - He won't understand.<br> He seems good at sensing attitudes.<br> I wouldn't want him to think<br> that mine was anything personal...<br> ...as far as he's concerned.<br> - All right.<br> - We can't keep that kid.<br> - You said you wanted a child.<br> I thought you meant<br> a child of our own.<br> You know that's impractical.<br> How could I have a baby?<br> - How could you have a baby?<br> - I'm not saying we never will.<br> I don't see what that has to do<br> with Chris. This is a humanitarian idea.<br> If we had a kid of our own, he might be<br> a swell addition to the family.<br> But as a substitution, he won't do.<br> Besides, we haven't got a home<br> he'd be happy in.<br> Sam, you cannot send that child back.<br> I'd look perfectly idiotic.<br> Besides, it isn't a question of pride.<br> I wanna help.<br> I know, your heart is in it.<br> Your heart is in everything you do.<br> If you could spare about<br> ...from the world at large<br> and apply it here at home...<br> Hello.<br> It's Gerald. He says there's something<br> important on the Teletype...<br> ...six or seven items back.<br> - All right.<br> Yes, I told her.<br> Yes, I told her it was important.<br> Sam, look.<br> Operator, I want to speak to Miss Ellen<br> Whitcomb at New Milford, Connecticut.<br> This is Miss Harding,<br> at Atwater 9-0599.<br> Yes. Will you call me, please? Thanks.<br> Hello. Pop! I was just gonna call you.<br> Well, I don't know,<br> it's so unexpected. I...<br> Yes. They're going to present<br> a plaque at a banquet...<br> ...a week from tomorrow night.<br> You will? Oh, that's wonderful.<br> Yes, I'm sure she will.<br> Well, I haven't spoken to her yet.<br> I have a call in now.<br> I can't wait to tell her.<br> Thanks, darling.<br> All right, I'll see you then. Goodbye.<br> Would you have voted for me, Sam?<br> Hello.<br> Ellen, Tess.<br> The most wonderful thing that's ever<br> happened to me has just happened.<br> Darling.<br> Do I look like the husband<br> of the Woman of the Year?<br> You look fine.<br> I guess I got time<br> to go say hello to Chris, huh?<br> I never been to a woman's banquet.<br> Is the food better than at a man's?<br> Chicken instead of steak,<br> but we get a prize for going.<br> They won't ask me to make a speech,<br> will they?<br> I don't see why.<br> Hello, Chris.<br> - Hello.<br> - Attaboy, Chris.<br> Why, you'll be spouting English<br> in no time.<br> Nice set of toys you got here.<br> All you need<br> is a baseball diamond and...<br> ...a football field, a playground and...<br> ...eight other guys, and you're all set.<br> Chris, maybe tomorrow<br> we'll go to the zoo.<br> Get some peanuts for the elephants.<br> Yeah, get some for us too, huh, Chris?<br> Good night.<br> - How do I look?<br> - Beautiful.<br> That's a great collection of toys<br> he has in there.<br> Sam, Ellen's downstairs.<br> It's 8. They'll think I'm<br> trying to make an entrance.<br> What were you planning to do,<br> come up out of the floor?<br> - You get him those toys?<br> - Gerald did. Was he playing?<br> He was playing<br> a set of tennis with himself.<br> I'll get him some myself<br> in the morning.<br> Alma's no playmate<br> for that kid, anyway.<br> Where is Alma?<br> She's going to the banquet. She feels<br> responsible for winning this thing.<br> - The banquet?<br> - He'll be all right, he's old enough.<br> We'll be home by midnight.<br> - He can cry a lot in 4 hours.<br> - The elevator boy'll look in on him.<br> - Yeah, they all speak Greek.<br> - Sam, we've got to go. Ellen's waiting.<br> - You go. I'll stay till he falls asleep.<br> - Sam, don't be idiotic.<br> You simply don't want to come,<br> that's why the paternal act.<br> I'm not putting on any act.<br> We accepted responsibility.<br> - What shall I say you're doing?<br> - Say I'm at home minding the baby.<br> I don't care what you tell them.<br> Tell them I had something to do.<br> Who would believe you had anything<br> that was important enough to do...?<br> It's too bad I'm not covering<br> this dinner tonight...<br> ...because I've got an angle<br> that would really be sensational.<br> The Outstanding Woman of the Year<br> isn't a woman at all.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You coming?<br> Chris, we're getting out of here.<br> We try not to be too strict with them.<br> They're so high-spirited.<br> I suppose you're interested<br> in an application.<br> - We have a waiting list...<br> - I'm afraid you don't understand.<br> - I just brought one back.<br> - One of our children?<br> Yes, yes. His name is Chris.<br> He just ran upstairs.<br> Seemed to meet a friend.<br> My wife brought him home<br> before she talked to me about it.<br> Didn't you like the child?<br> Oh, yes. The boy has nothing to do<br> with it, I just didn't like the idea.<br> It's a great responsibility, and it seems<br> to turn the house upside down.<br> I see. Will you come in?<br> Never forget that Adolf Hitler...<br> - What did you say your name was?<br> - Craig. Sam Craig.<br> - Whose pathetic distinction is the number<br> of male children she contributes...<br> ... to the very state<br> which holds her in bondage.<br> That contrast increases the pride<br> with which we now...<br> ... bestow this plaque on America 's<br> Outstanding Woman of the Year.<br> Why, aren't you...?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who so magnificently symbolizes...<br> ... the full and rounded life...<br> ... of glorious emancipation<br> of womanhood...<br> ...in this country.<br> Our distinguished guest:<br> Tess Harding.<br> Sam should be here any minute.<br> While we're waiting,<br> let's grab shots of you working.<br> Yes, we need some informal stuff.<br> I seldom work in these clothes.<br> I'll change. I won't be a minute.<br> There she is.<br> Where do you do your work?<br> What Clayton wants most<br> is you and Sam.<br> I work in there. If you don't get me<br> with my husband, I mean...<br> ...if he doesn't get home, you could get<br> a shot of me with my... Just a minute.<br> - You name it, Miss Harding.<br> - A shot of you with who?<br> With my typewriter.<br> That would be interesting.<br> Yeah, that would be something new.<br> Don't you see? We made an exception<br> in your case.<br> We only put people on our list who have<br> children or who want two of them.<br> - There's a nice Greek-American family...<br> - What you're saying is sound.<br> But I accepted Chris.<br> I intend to keep him.<br> There's no doubt that Chris<br> must be very fond of you.<br> But I gathered Mr. Craig doesn't<br> share your sympathy for children.<br> - It's my experience...<br> - Would you have him brought down?<br> - Tomorrow. He's sleeping.<br> - I'm sure he'll like to come home.<br> Very well.<br> - Hello, Chris.<br> - Hello.<br> We're gonna go home now.<br> Chris.<br> Oh, I'm sure he doesn't mean it.<br> Telegram.<br> Extension 558, please.<br> Hello, Sam.<br> This is Tess Harding. Remember me?<br> That's nice.<br> Sam...<br> ...something's come up<br> which seems to concern both of us.<br> Wonder if you'd mind<br> dropping up here for a minute.<br> No, honestly, it's a telegram.<br> Quite important.<br> I'll be right down, Sam.<br> - Hello, Mr. Craig.<br> - Hello, Miss Harding.<br> We got an invitation.<br> Connecticut, tomorrow night.<br> I'm afraid I can't make it.<br> - Won't be any fun alone.<br> - Sorry, I have to cover the fight.<br> - What fight?<br> - Championship.<br> Couldn't you duck it,<br> give some excuse?<br> No.<br> It's quite important.<br> In an unimportant sort of way.<br> I'll phone Ellen, tell her we'll drive up<br> tomorrow afternoon.<br> Don't bother.<br> I've got a pretty heavy week.<br> But, Sam...<br> ...Ellen won't understand<br> our not being together.<br> She'll think there's something<br> funny about it.<br> At first, maybe, but...<br> ...later on, she'll see the serious side.<br> Last night was quite a night.<br> Among other things, it seems that<br> both my men walked out on me.<br> Oh, Chris'll be all right.<br> He just needed a home.<br> I know.<br> We agree about that.<br> We're making progress.<br> Sam.<br> Why can't we sit down like adults<br> and patch this thing up?<br> I'm afraid that might become a habit.<br> Then we'd wind up with<br> a patchwork quilt instead of a marriage.<br> What do you want me to do,<br> just throw out everything we've had...<br> ...when it was so perfect?<br> Is that what you think it was,<br> a perfect marriage?<br> Didn't you?<br> I don't think it was either.<br> Perfect or a marriage.<br> I don't understand.<br> That's just the point.<br> I guess it wasn't much use,<br> my conniving my way down here.<br> Depends on what you were after.<br> I was sort of hoping<br> that you'd kiss me goodbye.<br> I was sort of hoping<br> that you'd ask me.<br> Bye.<br> Harriet.<br> Hello.<br> Asa. I'm so glad to see you both.<br> Land's sake, you're just in time,<br> Mrs. Craig.<br> In time for what?<br> Where's Mr. Craig?<br> He's not coming.<br> What goes on here?<br> - You're both in a dither.<br> - Miss Ellen's upstairs.<br> What's the mystery?<br> - All right, you're ravishing.<br> - Tess.<br> What goes on?<br> - How are you, dear?<br> - Quit stalling. What goes on?<br> Well, it...<br> ...seems there's going to be a wedding.<br> If there's one thing I'm not<br> in the mood for, it's a wedding.<br> - Who is it? Anyone I know?<br> - Yes, I should think so.<br> Me.<br> - It's Pop, of course.<br> - Of course.<br> I think it's wonderful.<br> I was hoping you'd say that.<br> Isn't it strange how you can<br> know someone for quite a long time...<br> ...and never quite... I mean...<br> - Yes, it is.<br> I hope you don't think we needed<br> you to give us the idea.<br> - Matter of fact, we did.<br> - Should've asked my permission.<br> You modern fathers have no respect<br> for tradition.<br> I was sure you'd approve my choice,<br> and I intended to ask for your blessing.<br> - Dr. Potter here?<br> - You bet. I went and got him myself.<br> I'm taking no chances. Where's Sam?<br> Isn't he downstairs?<br> He had to work.<br> World's championship. Fight.<br> But I wanted him for my bridesmaid.<br> I was his best man.<br> Oh, getting married without Sam.<br> He'd feel worse<br> if you put it off on his account.<br> Dr. Potter's ready,<br> wants to know if you are.<br> Go on. I'll take care of the bride.<br> Can't marry my father<br> looking like somebody's aunt.<br> Were you really surprised?<br> Frankly...<br> ...yes.<br> Somehow, I never thought of you<br> as being anyone's wife.<br> Well, I know I'm not<br> a magazine-cover bride, but...<br> No, I don't mean that.<br> You're my woman of the century.<br> I always felt that you were<br> above marriage.<br> Well, that's a nice consoling way<br> of looking at it.<br> Can't live alone in this world, Tess.<br> It's no good.<br> Success is no fun<br> unless you share it with someone.<br> I'm tired of winning prizes.<br> They're cold comfort.<br> This time, I want to be the prize myself.<br> Come on, Ellen. There's no reason<br> for you to pretend...<br> ...you've been miserable<br> all these years.<br> I'm sorry I said it.<br> There's no way you could understand<br> what I've felt.<br> No reason why you should.<br> No chance of your making<br> a wrong choice.<br> You have Sam now,<br> while you're still young.<br> They're waiting, Miss Ellen.<br> Come on.<br> Dearly beloved...<br> ...we are gathered here together<br> in the sight of God...<br> ...and in the face of this company...<br> ...to join together this man<br> and this woman in holy matrimony.<br> Which is an honorable estate...<br> ...instituted of God...<br> ...and therefore is not by any to be<br> entered into unadvisedly or lightly...<br> ...but reverently, discreetly, soberly...<br> ...and in the fear of God.<br> You are performing an act<br> of utter faith.<br> Believing in one another to the end.<br> As the bride gives herself<br> to the bridegroom...<br> ...let him be to her<br> father and mother...<br> ...sister and brother...<br> ...and, most sacred, husband.<br> As he gives himself to her...<br> ...let the bride inspire and sustain him...<br> ...let her unite with him<br> in all the experiences of life...<br> ...to which their paths shall lead.<br> The great moments and the small.<br> That the joys of each<br> shall be the joys of both.<br> And the sorrows of each,<br> the sorrows of both.<br> If you wish your new estate<br> to be touched with lasting beauty...<br> ...cherish those gracious visions<br> of your first love.<br> Let them not be blurred<br> by the common events of life.<br> Be not moved in your devotion.<br> Believe in the ideal.<br> You saw it once.<br> It still exists.<br> It is the final truth.<br> William...<br> ...wilt thou have this woman<br> to thy wedded wife...<br> ...to live together after God's ordinance<br> in the holy estate of matrimony?<br> Hey. I wonder if you could<br> let me into my apartment.<br> Your apartment?<br> - I'm Mrs. Craig.<br> - Mr. Craig married?<br> Obviously. I've been out of town.<br> He took this place in my absence.<br> I'll take a chance.<br> Goodbye.<br> Flour.<br> "Separate three eggs."<br> Good morning.<br> What now?<br> I've come home, Sam.<br> Afraid I can't agree with you, Tess.<br> But, Sam.<br> This is our apartment by the river<br> you've always wanted, isn't it?<br> - I'm going to be part of it.<br> - What's the gag?<br> Sam, Pop and Ellen were married<br> last night.<br> I listened to the words.<br> You can't listen to them without...<br> You listened to them once before.<br> But I didn't hear them. Honestly,<br> I didn't. I heard them last night, though.<br> I love you, Sam.<br> Will you marry me?<br> You mean love, honor, cherish<br> and obey until death do us part?<br> - Yes, Sam.<br> - You're gonna live here with me?<br> Kiss me goodbye and wait for me<br> to come home...<br> ...with stories about<br> what you and the girls did?<br> Yes, Sam.<br> Gonna run up diminity curtains<br> and sew my underwear?<br> - Yes.<br> - Cook and sew...<br> ...and put on your rubber gloves<br> and wash the dishes?<br> This is the top phony of them all.<br> You've pulled some dandies, but<br> you've really reached the heights now.<br> Barging in here at dawn,<br> flushed and starry-eyed...<br> ...and expect me to see rice<br> and old shoes floating through the air...<br> - Sam, why won't you believe me?<br> - I'll tell you why I won't believe you.<br> Every time you've tried to duck an issue,<br> you've made love to me. And I fell for it.<br> Until, in the office yesterday,<br> you realized that I was wise to you.<br> Now, why don't you drop the curtain<br> on this act.<br> But, Sam, you don't understand.<br> I'm gonna give up my job.<br> Really? What are you gonna do,<br> run for president?<br> I'm going to be your wife.<br> You don't think I can do<br> the ordinary things any idiot can do.<br> - No.<br> - Why not?<br> Because you're incapable of it.<br> You can't expect Seabiscuit to stop,<br> drink a glass of water and count to 7.<br> - That takes training.<br> - Well, I'm not Seabiscuit.<br> Fourth down, you better kick.<br> Sam, I can't do it.<br> I've tried, but I can't.<br> Tess. I'm disappointed in you.<br> I've been mad, but this is<br> the first I've been disappointed.<br> Make them stop.<br> Why do you have to go<br> to extremes, Tess?<br> I don't wanna be married<br> to Tess Harding...<br> ...any more than I want you to be just<br> Mrs. Craig. Why can't you be...<br> ...Tess Harding-Craig?<br> - I think it's a wonderful name.<br> Miss Harding... Miss Harding!<br> They told me at the office<br> that you'd telephoned for this address.<br> You've got to launch a battleship<br> at 8:30.<br> Gerald.<br> I've just launched Gerald.<br>
