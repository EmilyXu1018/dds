                        Enjoy !<br> - Did you make a wish?<br> - Yeah.<br> No lunch. I got speech class.<br> What do you need speech class for?<br> You talk fine.<br> All right. I'll pick you up at five,<br> we'll ride back together.<br> I can't. I got Emerging Markets<br> seminar at 5.30.<br> Jeez, it's your birthday. Can't they<br> emerge without you just this once?<br> - What time is my surprise party?<br> - What?<br> Come on.<br> I'm supposed to take you to drinks<br> and have you home at seven.<br> I'll cut out early and be home at 7.15, OK?<br> - All right.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Morning, Tess.<br> - Morning.<br> - Hi, Tess.<br> - Hi.<br> Mr Turkel's line.<br> Who's calling, please?<br> Hold on a moment.<br> Mr Lutz?<br> Hold on a second, all right?<br> Mr Turkel?<br> Mr Alagash... Hi.<br> - Mr Alagash is real anxious to talk to you.<br> - You couldn't maybe get him to hold?<br> You got him in Dentitech -<br> the one I said go short on.<br> It's fine, but he don't wanna<br> hear it from a secretary.<br> - There's no paper.<br> - What?<br> There is no goddamned paper<br> in this stall. Get me some?<br> Thanks. You're very kind.<br> You're short on Dentitech at 18.<br> He'll be right here.<br> See Dentitech closing? 17 and 1/8. Come Monday,<br> I bet it's 16 and still sittin' there.<br> - How you figure?<br> - They went public at 23 with one product.<br> Plaque-removing mouthwash?<br> You rinse, you get this glob of plaque<br> you gotta spit out.<br> Maybe it'll be big, but no one ever got rich<br> overestimating what<br> the American public wants to taste.<br> Maybe.<br> Before I run, Tess, I have some<br> good news and some bad news.<br> The straight shot is they turned you down<br> for the entre programme again.<br> - Why?<br> - We did all we could, Tessy.<br> You've got to remember you're up against<br> Harvard and Wharton graduates.<br> You've got some night school,<br> some secretarial time on your sheet.<br> - Christians and lions, Tess.<br> - That's right.<br> - And the good news?<br> - Dave has a friend.<br> Bob in Arbitrage. You're so hungry,<br> they're looking for hungry down there.<br> - Really?<br> - Hungry's the name of the game down there.<br> Bob's looking for a new assistant<br> and wants to meet you for a drink.<br> This isn't another setup?<br> Do I look like a pimp?<br> Bob says he's looking for hungry,<br> I think to myself "Tess". The rest is up to you.<br> - Bob in Arbitrage.<br> - Bob Speck.<br> Extension 256. Expecting your call.<br> Go get 'em, Tessy.<br> You should have told us.<br> Congratulations, Tessy.<br> Thanks.<br> Mick?<br> Surprise.<br> Happy birthday.<br> You look great.<br> Come here.<br> You know, Mick, just once I could go for,<br> like, a sweater or some earrings.<br> You know? A present that I can<br> actually wear outside of this apartment.<br> So...<br> Is this where you usually meet for drinks?<br> This is a big week.<br> A super week. We are celebrating.<br> So, Arbitrage. Talk about adrenaline, huh?<br> What do you think is the most<br> important quality for a great arbitrager?<br> - Well, we'll go through all that at the hotel.<br> - The hotel?<br> The company keeps a suite<br> at the Ritz Carlton.<br> When it's empty they give it<br> to us boys on a bonus basis.<br> We're gonna party.<br> I'm sorry. Allow me. I'm so sorry.<br> - Hey, Bob. Please.<br> - Sorry, I just... I get a little carried away.<br> You know what? Arbitrage has put out this sort of<br> "Introduction to..." tape for the business schools.<br> - Why don't we put it in. If you have any questions...<br> - That would be great. Thanks.<br> It's the wrong tape. Unless of course you...<br> Bob, you're not seriously looking<br> for a new assistant, are you?<br> Not exactly at this moment. But I'm always<br> on the lookout for new blood.<br> I am hungry, Bob, but I am not that hungry.<br> - I wouldn't put it that way.<br> - I would.<br> - Would you just pull over right here, please?<br> - What are you doing?<br> Party, Bob.<br> Hello, Tess.<br> You're late, Tess.<br> Yo, David.<br> Little bitch.<br> You gotta see this to believe it.<br> Take it easy.<br> Bastard.<br> - Tess... Tess... Tess...<br> - I know.<br> You don't get ahead in this world<br> by calling your boss a pimp.<br> Well, he is.<br> Been lookin' at your file here.<br> This is the third time in six months<br> I've had to place you.<br> - It wasn't my fault.<br> - Where have I heard that before?<br> Ruth, look it.<br> I'm 30 years old.<br> It took me five years of night school,<br> but I got my degree with honours.<br> I know I could do a job.<br> Ask any of my bosses, even Lutz,<br> if Tess McGill hasn't called a few.<br> You ask 'em. I don't think<br> they're gonna sing your praises, Tess.<br> Here's something for you.<br> Transferring down from Boston.<br> Mergers and Acquisitions.<br> Name is Parker. Starts Monday.<br> - You go home and cool off.<br> - OK.<br> Tess...<br> This is the last time I can help you.<br> Four strikes, you're out.<br> - Tess McGill for Katharine Parker's office.<br> - It's the last desk. At the end of the aisle.<br> Hi. I'm Katharine Parker. You must be Tess.<br> Hi.<br> Great bunny.<br> I don't usually have a bunny on my desk.<br> It was my birthday a few days ago.<br> - No kidding. Mine's next Tuesday. How old?<br> - 30.<br> Really? Well, I'll be 30 next Tuesday.<br> We're practically twins.<br> - Except I'm older.<br> - Just barely.<br> I've never worked for somebody who was<br> younger than me before. Or for a woman.<br> Well, there's a first time for everything.<br> It's not going to be a problem, is it, Tess?<br> - No.<br> - Good.<br> Why don't you pour us a couple of coffees<br> and come on inside? I'm light, no sugar.<br> The stock is at 38, the tender's at 56.<br> Come in.<br> Yeah, what do we do about that?<br> Well, I just checked my three.<br> What are yours?<br> Yeah, I have that one.<br> I think he's in an underwater position.<br> All right. That's our first and second call,<br> and then we'll see where we are.<br> I'll count the minutes. Bye.<br> Thanks.<br> So, Tess, a few ground rules.<br> The way I look at it,<br> you are my link with the outside world.<br> People's impression of me starts with you.<br> You're tough when it's warranted,<br> accommodating when you can be.<br> You're accurate. You're punctual.<br> You never make a promise you can't keep.<br> I'm never on another line, I'm in a meeting.<br> I consider us a team, Tess,<br> and as such we have a uniform.<br> Simple, elegant, impeccable.<br> "Dress shabbily, they notice the dress.<br> Dress impeccably, they notice the woman."<br> Coco Chanel.<br> How do I look?<br> You look terrific.<br> You might wanna rethink the jewellery.<br> I want your input, Tess. I welcome your ideas<br> and I like to see hard work rewarded.<br> It's a two-way street on my team.<br> Am I making myself clear?<br> Yes, Katharine.<br> - And call me Katharine.<br> - OK.<br> So, let's get to work, shall we?<br> This department's profile last year was damn pitiful.<br> Our team's got its work cut out for it.<br> OK. Thanks.<br> Damn. I forgot my pills again.<br> It's the third time this month.<br> Did you hear about that shot<br> they got in Europe?<br> They're giving it to women, in their arm.<br> It's good for five years.<br> Damn pills. I'm always forgetting 'em.<br> - I thought you might like this.<br> - Thank you.<br> Tess, would you come in here, please,<br> and bring a notebook?<br> They've sold the paper and printing divisions.<br> They sell Distribution too,<br> we're talking real scorched earth.<br> Come on in.<br> Tess, this is Ginny. Ginny, Tess.<br> Being new in town, I thought I'd throw a little<br> cocktail thing to introduce myself to the department.<br> Ginny here has some great ideas.<br> Will you jot them down?<br> The caterer is called Acme Eats.<br> You can get the number from Information.<br> They do the usual hors d'oeuvres and such.<br> The Raging Bull has a bartender service.<br> And the liquor store<br> on Broadway and Liberty delivers.<br> - Got that, Bess?<br> - Tess, yeah.<br> - If that's the way that you wanna go.<br> - You have another idea?<br> Well, I was just reading in W about dim sum -<br> these little Chinese dumplings.<br> A restaurant on Mott Street<br> does them for cocktail parties.<br> - I love those little dumplings.<br> - It might be more fun than the usual tidbits.<br> - I have it on my desk. I could get it.<br> - You read W?<br> I read a lot of things. You never know<br> where the big ideas could come from.<br> I guess you're right. If dumplings<br> can be considered a big idea.<br> - Well, that oughta get you started...<br> - Ginny, thank you so much.<br> - Back to the gold mines.<br> - Right.<br> - You'll set those up?<br> - Right away.<br> Dim sum, Tess. I like it, contribution-wise.<br> Keep it up.<br> The chief says "We will respect your wish.<br> We will give you an honourable death."<br> "But first, keke."<br> Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> - Dim sum?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> Come on, Katharine. What do you say?<br> Jim, the man who spends<br> every weekend in August glued to his desk,<br> that man knows that I can't<br> just sneak out of my own party.<br> I'll tell you what, though. You get me<br> in on the Southeast Air divestiture plan,<br> I'll buy you a drink.<br> Bottle of Cristal, two straws.<br> - Deal?<br> - Okey-dokey.<br> - Dim sum?<br> - Hi.<br> Thank you. What a slob.<br> You were so smooth with him.<br> I probably would have...<br> Never burn bridges. Today's junior prick,<br> tomorrow's senior partner.<br> - So, how do you think the party's going?<br> - Pretty well, I think.<br> Should I stop serving now?<br> - Better make one more round.<br> - Right.<br> I'd love to help you, but we can't busy<br> the quarterback with passing out the Gatorade.<br> Arnie, my hero. You've come.<br> Yeah?<br> I have an idea<br> and you said I could come to you.<br> Shoot.<br> Well, you know how Trask Industries<br> has been looking to buy into broadcasting?<br> - Something about that the department is...<br> - Working on it, yeah.<br> I've been following it myself,<br> and all of a sudden I thought "radio".<br> - Trask is looking for television stations.<br> - So is every Tom, Dick and Harry.<br> My idea is that they get their feet wet in radio<br> and build from there.<br> It's not as glamorous<br> as jumping right into TV,<br> but it's a solid place to start<br> and there's a lot more of them for sale.<br> Plus it would solve Trask's problem with<br> the Japanese competitors trying to take him over,<br> because FCC forbids foreign ownership<br> of radio as well as TV.<br> Interesting. You've been<br> following this, you say?<br> Yeah.<br> No chance you overheard it,<br> say on the elevator?<br> - No, no way.<br> - Somewhere.<br> It's my idea.<br> Good, good.<br> - Discuss it with anyone else?<br> - Nope. You think there's something there?<br> Well, I can think it through for you.<br> Why don't you leave me your notes?<br> I'll have a look-see.<br> OK.<br> I've been trying to get into the entre<br> programme and this would be a big push.<br> - If anything happens, you'll...<br> - Absolutely, Tess.<br> Two-way street, remember?<br> Yeah, thank you.<br> It's just... It's so exciting.<br> I mean, she takes me seriously.<br> I know you hate when I say this,<br> but I think it's because she's a woman.<br> There's none of that<br> chasing-around-the-desk crap.<br> And it's like she wants to be my mentor,<br> which is exactly what I needed.<br> I feel like I'm finally gettin' somewhere.<br> That's great, but let's step on it<br> or the pizza's gonna freeze, honey.<br> Maybe we could all go out sometime.<br> Dinner in the city.<br> You would like her, I think.<br> God. Remember when all you had to do<br> was a few buckles?<br> Yeah. Those were the days.<br> I called the inn. All they can give you<br> is a ground-floor single in the new wing.<br> Did you tell them it was me?<br> Well, I said Parker.<br> It's this tower room with a canopy bed<br> and a fireplace big enough to stand in.<br> Perfect. Everything's in place.<br> - For what?<br> - The man I've been seeing for a while.<br> I think he's it. And I think<br> this could be the weekend we decide.<br> He said there was something very important<br> he wanted to discuss with me.<br> I think he's gonna pop the question.<br> - You do?<br> - I think so.<br> We're in the same city now.<br> I've indicated that I'm receptive to an offer.<br> I've cleared the month of June.<br> And I am, after all, me.<br> What if he doesn't pop the question?<br> I really don't think that's a variable.<br> Tess, you don't get anywhere in this world<br> by waiting for what you want to come to you.<br> You make it happen.<br> Watch me, Tess. Learn from me.<br> By the way, I ran your Trask radio idea<br> by some of our people.<br> It seems Trask is dead set on television.<br> But it wasn't out in left field either.<br> I really liked the idea.<br> You just keep plugging and bring me<br> your ideas, and we'll see what we can do.<br> - Thank you, Katharine.<br> - Tess...<br> Look at me. Who makes it happen?<br> I do.<br> Who does?<br> I do. I make it happen.<br> That's right. Only then<br> do we get what we deserve.<br> Miss Parker's office.<br> Hi, Katharine.<br> - You what?<br> - Broke it. Skiing.<br> They won't be able to move me for two weeks,<br> so this is what I need you to do.<br> Water plants. OK.<br> Cable comes on Friday.<br> Easy with the leg, will you?<br> Quit staring up my gown.<br> Now, I'm staying at my parents' house<br> and the housekeeper is in Barbados.<br> What a mess. You need to let in<br> the flower man and the cleaning lady.<br> Sort through the mail.<br> The entrance code for the front door is...<br> It's 754-3-2000.<br> I know there's more, but I can't think of what.<br> Go through the calendar on my desk.<br> There's a bunch of invitations to be RSVP'd.<br> I know I'm asking an awful lot, Tess,<br> but I don't know what else to do.<br> - I need you to take over.<br> - OK. Bye.<br> Regarding those horrid little<br> knick-knacks from the Alberts...<br> Dear Eleanor and Gary.<br> Thank you for the salt and pepper shakers.<br> Not only are they the perfect house-warming<br> gift, but it was so dear of you to think of me.<br> Dear Sister. It's hard to believe it's been eight<br> years since we said goodbye to Wellesley,<br> but of course we never really say goodbye.<br> On behalf of the Alumni Giving Fund,<br> I am writing to you to ask...<br> Dear Sister. It's hard to believe it's been eight<br> years since we said goodbye to Wellesley,<br> but of course we never really say goodbye.<br> On behalf of the Alumni Giving Fund,<br> I am writing to you to ask...<br> To ask... To a... To ask... To... ask...<br> I am writing to you to ask...<br> Dear Momo and Baa.<br> Here I am living in Mummy's house<br> while I brave the New York real-estate market<br> looking for a place of my own.<br> I miss you all terribly, but it will be so lovely<br> to see you when you return from Barbados.<br> Till then, have fun. Much love to you<br> and, of course, to Claudette.<br> Love, Kiki.<br> To Jack Trainer,<br> Dewey Stone & Company, from me.<br> Re: Trask Industries -<br> radio network acquisition.<br> Hard copy on this from the home<br> computer. Do not go through Tess.<br> To Jack Trainer,<br> Dewey Stone & Company, from me.<br> Re: Trask Industries -<br> radio network acquisition.<br> Hard copy on this from the home<br> computer. Do not go through Tess.<br> "Two-way street."<br> And "You make it happen".<br> - What? No class?<br> - No class.<br> Tess, this is not what it looks like.<br> I mean, it is what it looks like,<br> but I can explain.<br> - Well, not exactly explain.<br> - You snake.<br> Shit.<br> Come on, Tess. I'm sorry, I really am.<br> I love you. Come on.<br> Come back and hit me.<br> Please.<br> Hello. Mr Trainer's office, please?<br> Hello. Tess McGill calling from Petty Marsh.<br> May I put her through?<br> Thank you.<br> Mr Trainer?<br> Hi, this is Tess McGill. I work with Katharine<br> Parker over here in Mergers and Acquisitions.<br> I have a proposal that<br> I'd like to discuss with you.<br> Not over the phone, though.<br> I have an opening<br> tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.<br> OK.<br> I'll messenger an outline<br> over to you right now.<br> Bye.<br> Yes, I'm calling for Katharine Parker<br> in regard to your invitation.<br> Miss Parker is out of town, but Miss Tess<br> McGill will be attending in her place.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Why does it do that?<br> - For cleaning.<br> - Are you kiddin' me?<br> No.<br> What is this thing you're going to anyway?<br> The closing party for the Minidyne-Dalton<br> merger. Dewey Stone is throwing it.<br> That's where Trainer works.<br> It's the perfect time to meet him.<br> Mix business with pleasure.<br> Fringe times are crucial.<br> What'd you do, snatch her invite?<br> Well, she can't use it.<br> It's important for me to start interacting<br> with people, not as a secretary...<br> But as a total impostor. Right.<br> This is it.<br> It needs some bows or somethin'.<br> No. It's simple, elegant,<br> yet makes a statement.<br> Says to people: confident, a risk-taker,<br> not afraid to be noticed.<br> Then you hit 'em with your smarts.<br> Here. Shoes. I need shoes.<br> $6,000? It's not even leather.<br> $6,000?<br> $6,000.<br> - Cyn, I can't breathe so good.<br> - Oh, God. Come here.<br> Sit down. Let's see<br> if she's got anything soothing.<br> Valium. In the convenient economy size.<br> - You sure?<br> - Just chills you ever so slightly.<br> You won't even notice it.<br> Are you sure about this?<br> You wanna be taken seriously,<br> you need serious hair.<br> Go for the jugular. Look, I've been<br> telling you this for thre weeks.<br> There are 19 million shares outstanding.<br> We got 25%. We get another 5%,<br> we've got 'em by the throat.<br> - Trainer, let's grab 'em by the balls.<br> - Leave our hearts at home.<br> Cut 'em off at the knees. They'll be<br> eating out of our hands. What do you say?<br> - Anybody thirsty?<br> - We need this one, Trainer.<br> - You need this one.<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> - I've been looking for you.<br> - Why? Do you know me?<br> No, but I promised myself that,<br> when I saw you, I would get to know you.<br> You're the first woman I've seen in one of<br> these damn things that dresses like a woman,<br> not like a woman thinks<br> a man would dress if he was a woman.<br> - Thank you, I guess.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> I'm looking for someone myself. His name<br> is Jack Trainer. He works at Dewey Stone.<br> Do you know if he's here?<br> Why are you looking for him?<br> Well, because I have a meeting with him tomorrow.<br> I thought it might be nice<br> to say hello and get a head start.<br> Well, he just left.<br> - I should be going myself.<br> - Have a drink with me.<br> I can't. What's your name?<br> No. No names. No business cards.<br> - No "You must know so and so".<br> - What is this?<br> No rsums. Let's just meet<br> like human beings for once.<br> It's nice to meet you, whatever your name is,<br> but I really do have to go.<br> Please. Please. One drink.<br> OK, one drink. But I'm buying.<br> OK, but it's an open bar.<br> I knew that. I meant that<br> if it wasn't, I would be buying.<br> Yeah.<br> - Tequila Gold. Doubles.<br> - Tequila?<br> Yeah. I promised myself that<br> when we met we'd drink tequila.<br> No Chardonnay, no frog water.<br> Real drinks.<br> These things are usually so boring.<br> I wouldn't know.<br> Power to the people.<br> The little people.<br> Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.<br> Oh boy, oh boy...<br> - You OK?<br> - I'm fine. I'm just fine.<br> I took an antihistamine before,<br> and it just makes for a nice little buzz.<br> I didn't know they let<br> bad girls into these things.<br> - Do I look like I don't belong here?<br> - No.<br> No, no. I'm sure you're a real ace<br> at whatever it is that you do do.<br> - Damn straight.<br> - But how you look...<br> I have a head for business and a bod for sin.<br> Is there anything wrong with that?<br> No... No.<br> Hello. Hi.<br> I have to go now.<br> - I'll come with you.<br> - No.<br> Hey, Tess.<br> I need some air. Meet me outside. Thank you.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hello?<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Where do you live?<br> Where do you live?<br> Park, trees, tall building.<br> - 166 Morton. Near Hudson.<br> - 166 Morton.<br> Might be kind of a mess.<br> The cleaning lady<br> keeps changing days on me.<br> Anybody's guess.<br> I'm just warning you cos,<br> if it's the day before, it could be pretty bad.<br> I don't notice so much myself,<br> but some of the people I've had over have,<br> you know, remarked on it.<br> It's not so bad.<br> Would you...<br> Would you like a nightcap?<br> I guess not.<br> I guess it's too late for coffee.<br> Herb tea? Herb tea...?<br> I don't have any.<br> It always sounds good when people<br> offer it to me when I'm in your shape.<br> I might have a little brandy myself.<br> Boy...<br> You sure are pretty.<br> Don't fuck up. Don't fuck up.<br> Hi. Tess McGill to see Jack Trainer.<br> - May I take your coat?<br> - Yes, please.<br> Gentlemen, Tess McGill.<br> Miss McGill, I'm Jack Trainer.<br> How are you?<br> This is John Romano and Bernie Kotar.<br> Sit down, please.<br> - Coffee?<br> - Sure.<br> - Milk or sugar?<br> - Both, thank you.<br> I suppose we should just get right down to it.<br> Sure.<br> I've lost my briefcase.<br> In each of the last three quarters,<br> Trask Industries has announced plans<br> to acquire a major market television station,<br> each time unsuccessfully.<br> At the same time they've expended time<br> and money fighting off a hostile takeover attempt<br> by one of their Japanese competitors.<br> Buying into radio would, in one fell swoop<br> accomplish two important tasks.<br> It would give Trask<br> a solid base in broadcasting,<br> and, because of FCC regulations forbidding<br> foreign ownership of radio stations,<br> it would wipe out the threat<br> of a Japanese takeover.<br> Interesting idea.<br> But I don't like it.<br> Trask has got a lot of cash<br> on their balance sheet.<br> That's why they're a takeover target.<br> A radio station is small potatoes.<br> I can't see him biting.<br> I've already thought of that.<br> I figure that we look for a radio network -<br> one with a real high profile.<br> And with the surplus cash,<br> we implement a major stock repurchase.<br> So Trask is protected and their stock goes up,<br> and everybody's happy.<br> Or not.<br> Shoot me. Just shoot me.<br> Would you cut that out?<br> They didn't throw you out, did they?<br> Well, they don't exactly have bouncers.<br> They're a little more subtle than that, Cyn.<br> Oh, God. And last night.<br> Yeah. I should've checked the milligrams.<br> Live and learn.<br> Maybe he'll feel sorry for you, and make it<br> up to you doing your deal or whatever it is.<br> I'm not looking for sympathy.<br> You know, I had a shot at...<br> It's him. He's here.<br> Do me a favour. Be me. Be my secretary.<br> - Tess.<br> - Cyn, please, do it for me.<br> OK...<br> Tess.<br> - May I help you?<br> - Jack Trainer to see Miss McGill.<br> Let's give her a shout, shall we?<br> You decent?<br> A Mr Jack Trainer to see you, Miss McGill.<br> Thank you, Cynthia.<br> - Hold all calls, Miss McGill?<br> - Yes, Cynthia. Thank you.<br> Can I get you anything, Mr Trainer?<br> Coffee? Tea? Me?<br> Isn't she a riot? That'll be all, Cynthia.<br> Why did you say you weren't you last night?<br> Because I knew what would happen.<br> All mergers and acquisitions.<br> No lust and tequila.<br> That was... That just happened, OK?<br> I wanna make it clear...<br> What did happen exactly?<br> The earth moved. The angels wept.<br> The Polaroids are...<br> are in my other coat.<br> Nothing happened. Nothing happened.<br> I woke up in my underwear.<br> I'll bet you looked nice.<br> Did you get me that way?<br> I... I took off your shoes and dress,<br> I put you on the bed.<br> I kept my eyes closed the whole time.<br> And that was it?<br> I might have peeked. I don't remember.<br> Look, I don't have all day to hang out here<br> and discuss your sex life.<br> Here.<br> - What's this?<br> - Open it.<br> What's this for?<br> I thought you could use a better briefcase<br> if we're gonna put this deal together.<br> - You liked it.<br> - It has possibilities.<br> I wanna go first to Metro Radio Systems.<br> They're a solid family-owned,<br> mid-sized network in the South.<br> They had offers before and rejected 'em, but<br> the father's about to retire,<br> and the son's just been forced out<br> by his board of directors.<br> A lot of squabbling. A good time to go in.<br> OK.<br> Why didn't you just put it together<br> with your people here? Why come to us?<br> Will you excuse me for one second?<br> Sure.<br> You're not helping. No.<br> Bess, my computer's down.<br> I need Katharine's office right away.<br> Sure. Of course. No problem.<br> I'll be with you in five minutes.<br> - I need it five minutes ago.<br> - I'll be right with you.<br> - What's going on in there?<br> - She's dusting.<br> Jack, listen. My one o'clock is getting a little antsy,<br> so can I walk you to the elevator?<br> Sure, but first answer my question.<br> Right.<br> I came to you because<br> I wanted an ace on this. The best.<br> Good thinking.<br> Well, I'll fly down to Memphis<br> in the morning and feel them out.<br> Absolutely. Fine.<br> -...you'll just have to wait.<br> - Ginny, go right in. I'll be with you in a minute.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Can I get you anything? Coffee? Tea?<br> - Are you free for dinner tonight?<br> - No, sorry.<br> How about tomorrow?<br> I'll be back around eight.<br> - I can't.<br> - When, then?<br> I don't think we should<br> get involved that way.<br> What are you talking about?<br> What about last night?<br> Look, I'm not that girl.<br> Last night was special.<br> It wasn't so special. I had to<br> carry you up three flights of stairs.<br> I meant unusual special.<br> Look, we're in a business deal<br> together now,<br> and I just don't think we should<br> get involved that way.<br> My life is real complicated as it is.<br> I don't wanna complicate it either.<br> I just thought dinner, maybe a movie.<br> - We both know what we're talking about.<br> - I certainly hope so.<br> You know, maybe I just don't like you.<br> Me? Nah.<br> - You sure she's gonna show?<br> - It's my engagement party.<br> She knows she's dead meat if she doesn't.<br> Hi, Tess.<br> I'm real sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.<br> You're gonna be outta work,<br> you keep scamming like you are.<br> Look, I'm nervous as hell and I think Mick's<br> about to drown himself in a Scotch bottle.<br> - He's bad, huh?<br> - Throw him a bone, will ya?<br> I want happy humans here tonight.<br> Tess.<br> Snake.<br> You look different.<br> I'm not the same pathetic, trusting fool<br> that I was a couple of days ago.<br> - It shows, huh?<br> - Hey, Tess. How you doin'? What are you havin'?<br> Stow this behind the bar for me,<br> will you, Tony?<br> And I'll have a Chivas,<br> and buy Mick one of whatever.<br> You got it.<br> No, I just meant the hair, the duds,<br> and the briefcase. What's goin' on?<br> - Make fun if you want.<br> - No, no. You look good.<br> Classy.<br> Did you have to go<br> to traffic court or somethin'?<br> No, I just got off work.<br> I sort of got a promotion.<br> Well...<br> To Cyn and Tim.<br> To you and me.<br> To you and your promotion.<br> - To me getting a boat loan.<br> - You what? You did?<br> My loan was approved just this morning.<br> Put a down payment on Jimmy Noonan's old boat.<br> That's so great.<br> "Hours of fun for the entire family.<br> Love, Tess and Mick."<br> Thank you.<br> I put from both of us. I didn't know<br> if you'd gotten something or what.<br> OK, toast. We need a toast.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> From me and Tess and everybody here,<br> may your life together be long and happy,<br> and may the road always rise up to meet you.<br> When are we gonna toast<br> the two of you, Mick?<br> - We haven't really discussed it. Not recently.<br> - No.<br> You don't discuss it, boy. You just ask.<br> Here?<br> - Now?<br> - On your knees, man.<br> Mick.<br> Tess, will you marry me?<br> Maybe.<br> That's an answer?<br> You want another answer, ask another girl.<br> - You fuckin' humiliated us in there.<br> - You set us up, doing it like that.<br> What did you expect me to do?<br> Lie in front of all of those people?<br> Didn't know you'd have to lie.<br> I thought you'd want me to ask.<br> Three nights ago,<br> I find you in bed with Doreen.<br> We have a drink, a dance, and boom -<br> you want an answer about the rest of my life.<br> All right. OK.<br> Here we are, just the two of us.<br> Will you marry me or what?<br> Jesus, Mick.<br> Do we have to decide this right now?<br> I want to get things solidified.<br> Things in my life.<br> You're not the only one<br> who's got plans, you know.<br> - I said maybe.<br> - Maybe means dick.<br> Fuck maybe. I want an answer now.<br> Please don't yell at me.<br> You treat me like I'm...<br> Why do we always talk about<br> how you get treated?<br> Who the fuck died<br> and made you Grace Kelly?<br> I am not steak. You can't just order me.<br> Look, I don't need this. You get<br> your priorities straight, maybe we'll talk.<br> Right now, we're history.<br> Katharine Parker's office.<br> I'll switch you over.<br> Tess, it's me.<br> I couldn't find the red shoes...<br> Tess McGill's office. Who's calling?<br> One moment, please.<br> Jack.<br> It went well in Memphis. Yeah...<br> Really well, I think. But we're gonna<br> have to move fast and hit 'em high.<br> Armbrister thinks that Metro is family,<br> and you know how that can be.<br> He's willing to listen,<br> but you gotta get Trask to talk sweet.<br> He's thinking about 70 mil.<br> I've been up here all night,<br> working the numbers.<br> I'd like to go over it with you.<br> Can we meet for lunch?<br> Lunch is all right, isn't it?<br> Daylight, a lot of people around.<br> There's that real romantic souvlaki stand,<br> out in front of your place.<br> You're in no particular danger, I think.<br> Yeah. Meet you there around one.<br> OK, I'll see you then. Bye.<br> Mick's really raw.<br> He says he's gonna throw<br> the rest of your stuff out.<br> He kept me there talkin' at me<br> till five this morning.<br> Oh, God, Cyn. I'm sorry.<br> - How hard would it be to crash a wedding?<br> - What are you talkin' about?<br> Oren Trask's daughter is getting married<br> tomorrow. The reception is at the Union Club.<br> So I figure I blend in. I get to Trask.<br> I mean, how hard could that be?<br> The wedding party's not gonna admit<br> that they've never seen you before.<br> Nobody knows everybody at those things.<br> - Tess... Wait a minute.<br> - All I need is five minutes with Trask.<br> Tess, I'm talkin' to you.<br> What?<br> First of all, look me in the eye<br> and tell me you're not thinking,<br> even in your wildest dreams,<br> Mr Briefcase "Let's have lunch" there<br> is gonna take you away from all of this.<br> We're doing a deal together, that's all.<br> Cos you know you'll get your heart stomped,<br> just like you're stompin' Mick's.<br> Hey, it wasn't me poppin'<br> Doreen DiMucci in our bed, OK?<br> - How come you're all on his side?<br> - I'm not.<br> But you're not even giving him the chance<br> to make it up to you, and that's not like you.<br> Look, if you're so smart, why don't you act<br> smart and save your ass while you still can?<br> Else they're gonna find out,<br> you're not gonna have your job, or any job.<br> You lost your man and your home already.<br> I'm gonna come clean as soon as<br> I get my end set up. I swear.<br> - I know what I'm doing.<br> - So do I. Screwin' up your life.<br> No, I'm trying to make it better.<br> I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life<br> working my ass off and getting nowhere<br> just because I followed rules that<br> I had nothing to do with setting up, OK?<br> Tess McGill's office.<br> Katharine... No.<br> Of course it's still your office. I was just...<br> I'll see you, Tess.<br> Cyn.<br> Sometimes I sing and dance<br> around the house in my underwear.<br> Doesn't make me Madonna. Never will.<br> - Are you there?<br> - Yes, Katharine.<br> Don't get too used to those long lunches.<br> I'm coming back a week from today.<br> A week from today?<br> Isn't that faster than you thought?<br> Well, the doctor says I've got great bones.<br> Of course, his aren't too bad either.<br> Anyway, I need you to summarise<br> the Baron Oil prospectus...<br> Hi, Schatz.<br> And send that to me along with<br> the last two quarterly reports.<br> - You are a sport.<br> - Yes, I'm a sport.<br> OK. Bye.<br> So what kind of figures<br> have you been throwing at 'em?<br> Well, no exact figures yet.<br> What's their ballpark?<br> I want to get them excited about the concept<br> before I start throwing actual figures at them.<br> - Are they excited?<br> - They're going to be.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I've been working on this thing<br> for 36 hours straight.<br> I got a progress meeting with<br> the head of my department at 2 o'clock.<br> - Where the hell exactly are we?<br> - Don't yell at me.<br> Answer me.<br> As a matter of fact, I'm gonna see<br> Trask himself tomorrow.<br> I feel that we're strong enough<br> to go right to him.<br> Where are we meeting him? What time?<br> He's not expecting both of us.<br> Are you trying to fly this thing without me?<br> - No. I wouldn't do that.<br> - You go and set up this meeting without me.<br> What the hell kind of a way<br> to do business is this?<br> - Would you calm down?<br> - How am I supposed to calm down?<br> One lost deal is all it takes<br> to get canned these days.<br> The line buttons on my phone all have<br> an inch of little pieces of tape piled on.<br> The names of new guys over old guys.<br> Good men who aren't at the other end of<br> the line any more, all cos of one lost deal.<br> I don't wanna get buried<br> under a little piece of tape.<br> No one's trying to bury you<br> under a little piece of tape.<br> OK, so I've been in a little bit of a slump.<br> I'm not afraid to admit it. Give me<br> a break here. Don't go leading me on.<br> If you got some doubts about me,<br> say 'em to my face. Give me that much.<br> I don't have any doubts about you.<br> OK.<br> You need me, you know.<br> - I mean any doubts about your ability.<br> - You need me at that meeting.<br> Is he jet-lagged from somewhere,<br> or he just lunches late?<br> Three o'clock's a late lunch.<br> Well, it's not exactly lunch,<br> but there will be food there though.<br> - What's the story, Tess?<br> - It's his daughter's wedding.<br> - That's the meeting?<br> - It's the perfect opportunity.<br> He's happy, he's had a little champagne.<br> We look for an opening. Trust me.<br> What are we supposed to do?<br> Jump out of the wedding cake?<br> Don't be silly.<br> Welcome to our party. Come in.<br> Hello. Nice to see you.<br> Do you know which table you're at?<br> - No...<br> - Yes. I do, darling.<br> I see Phyllis. Come on.<br> Glad you could make it.<br> Oren and Barbara Trask.<br> - Tess McGill. What a great idea.<br> - Jack Trainer.<br> - It's so nice to see you again.<br> - Well, the kids thought it would be fun.<br> - You must be friends of Mark's.<br> - Well, let's get you over there.<br> Actually, I should go powder my bathroom...<br> nose. Darling, will you wait here?<br> It's so nice... See you later.<br> I think I'll get a drink.<br> Bunny.<br> Isn't he gorgeous?<br> Get a grip. Get a grip, Tess. Get a grip.<br> We're not even invited to this thing, are we?<br> OK, so we're not exactly invited. But he's here<br> and we're here. So that makes us...<br> - Total idiots.<br> -..in the right place at the right time.<br> You're like one of those crazed cops.<br> The kind nobody wants to ride with,<br> whose partners all end up dead or crazy.<br> Just act like you belong.<br> Do you love it or do you hate it?<br> - Love it.<br> - So do I.<br> But Mark says it looks like Nicaragua and<br> that we're making some kind of statement.<br> Oh, no. It's just like paradise.<br> It's like a paradise with little gold palm trees.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> I hope I'm not being rude, but who are you?<br> I'm Tess. I'm... I'm a friend of Mark's.<br> I'm just so happy that<br> I could be here for you today.<br> Glorious. Fabulous. Stunning, really.<br> Super. Elegant. Perfect.<br> You're right. This is crazy, so let's just go.<br> Excuse me.<br> The woman that's dancing with Oren -<br> what's her name?<br> - Elizabeth Stubblefield?<br> - That's right.<br> - Liz? Beth?<br> - Bitsy.<br> Bitsy. That's right.<br> Jack...<br> You wanna do it, do it.<br> Excuse us. Bitsy, don't break my heart<br> and tell me you don't remember me.<br> - Of course I do.<br> - Excuse us.<br> Talk about a small world, huh?<br> I mean, here we've just met and yet I feel<br> I've spent so much time working with you.<br> In a way. I'm in Mergers and Acquisitions<br> at Petty Marsh.<br> I really wish we were having more luck<br> with your team.<br> So do I. So do I.<br> I've been trying to set you up<br> with a radio network,<br> but my bosses think you're stuck on<br> acquiring television and won't even listen.<br> - Well, that's not true.<br> - That's what I said.<br> I said that the man who in 1971<br> looked into the future<br> and saw that it was named<br> microwave technology,<br> the man who applied Japanese management<br> principles while others kowtowed to the unions,<br> the man who saw the Ma Bell break-up<br> coming from miles away,<br> this man did not get to be<br> this man - you, I mean -<br> by shutting himself off to new ideas.<br> Am I right or am I right?<br> - I think you're right.<br> - Damn straight I'm right.<br> If you've got the right property, I'd love to hear.<br> - You would?<br> - Well, absolutely.<br> - What looks good now?<br> - There she is.<br> I just realised that I...<br> I'm hogging the father of the bride.<br> And I see Phyllis coming... What do you say<br> that I give you a call on Monday?<br> - Our media consultant is Tim Draper.<br> - Tim. Right.<br> - Honey, I'm starved.<br> - So am I.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Go ahead and laugh. He wants us to meet<br> with his people first thing Monday.<br> Oren Trask? The man who said "What if<br> we sliced the bread before we sold it?"<br> All right...<br> No, no, no. I loved it.<br> I had fun. And you were amazing.<br> - You think so?<br> - Amazing.<br> The Fort Worth station - projected revenues<br> should read up 8%, not 6%.<br> And where it says the FCC ruling on<br> Metro's Memphis transmitter is pending,<br> that's outdated. FCC approved it Friday.<br> Doubles the signal reach.<br> Ups the station's value by 30%.<br> And now back to our regularly<br> scheduled programming.<br> I guess we're ready.<br> - Trainer and McGill.<br> - Yes. Top of the stairs.<br> Are we waiting for Mr Trask?<br> Mr Trask doesn't sit in at this level.<br> Of course he doesn't.<br> Here's the way we see it. Trask Industries<br> has two important needs to meet at this time.<br> By acquiring Metro Radio Network,<br> you nail two birds with one stone...<br> Excuse me. Do you have any<br> other proposals besides Metro?<br> - No. Why?<br> - Metro's a terrific opportunity.<br> I'm sure it is, but a Chicago group<br> just put a bear hug on Metro this morning<br> and the company's in play.<br> - Just this morning?<br> - Who?<br> The Slade brothers.<br> Trask isn't aiming at radio anyway.<br> We certainly don't want<br> to get into a bidding war.<br> A moment, please.<br> Armbrister looks at Metro as if it were part<br> of his family. He cares who he's selling to.<br> Yes. And he holds the majority of the stock.<br> Look. If the Slades are uninvited,<br> and I'm sure they are,<br> and Armbrister and Trask can agree<br> on a deal, then we won't have a war.<br> If I get Armbrister up here,<br> will Trask take the meeting?<br> A lot of ifs. We really<br> don't want to get involved.<br> - 24 hours.<br> - Sorry. Not interested.<br> Yes, sir.<br> All right, sir.<br> Yes, he'll take the meeting.<br> - That was Mr Trask?<br> - Yes, it was.<br> How did he know?<br> He knows everything.<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> - Thanks.<br> How'd you get this scar?<br> Some guy pulled a knife in Detroit.<br> Really?<br> No. No.<br> I was 19 and I thought<br> it'd be cool to have a pierced ear.<br> My girlfriend stuck the needle through<br> and I fainted and hit my chin on the toilet.<br> Have you been telling that story ever since?<br> You're the only one<br> who knows the true story.<br> Except the girlfriend.<br> I had her disappear.<br> It's too bad. Nice girl. Real shame.<br> Jack, there's something that I have to tell you.<br> Hello.<br> Hi.<br> I know. No...<br> Can't wait.<br> Yeah, OK. Well, call me when you get in.<br> OK.<br> Me too.<br> OK. Bye.<br> Bye.<br> OK... There's this woman.<br> It's over.<br> But technically it's not. I just haven't<br> had a chance to break it off yet.<br> It's OK. You don't have to explain.<br> No, really. We were supposed to go away<br> together a couple of weeks ago<br> and I was gonna tell her then.<br> But I had to work through the weekend<br> and never got there.<br> It's just a... a timing thing.<br> It's just she broke her leg skiing<br> and was laid up<br> and I couldn't see doing it<br> over the phone, you know.<br> Kicking somebody when they're down.<br> I wouldn't mention it, except<br> she's in your department at Petty.<br> - You mentioned her the first time you called.<br> - Katharine.<br> Parker. Yeah.<br> Now what did you wanna tell me?<br> It's not important.<br> Miss. Miss, you forget your book.<br> Tess. It's me. I'm back.<br> Thanks.<br> She took a muscle relaxant for the flight down.<br> - Let's all have one, shall we?<br> - I don't think so.<br> Telephone. I need a telephone.<br> Tess, take care of the bags.<br> I'll meet you at the car.<br> I love these pills.<br> Just for a minute, Jack. Please?<br> I must see you, darling.<br> My apartment in one hour<br> and I won't take no for an answer.<br> No, I won't take no for an answer.<br> Oh, I'm home. I'm home, I'm home.<br> Oh, God...<br> - Did you happen to see this?<br> - What is it?<br> It's an outline of your idea<br> for a Trask radio acquisition.<br> I was planning to send it over to Jack Trainer.<br> I thought I'd give your idea one last go-round.<br> It just occurs to me, looking at it,<br> that it reads as though it were my idea.<br> Jack got burned once. He was accused of<br> stealing a plan for taking a company private.<br> He's very sticky about the ethics of<br> reviewing other people's strategies.<br> He wouldn't do it if it was from a colleague,<br> and I couldn't say it was a secretary's notion.<br> Anyway, the point is, Tess,<br> that I'm still trying to get you heard.<br> What am I saying? If you had seen it,<br> you simply would have asked me about it.<br> Trust.<br> I'll need help bathing and changing.<br> I need something to cover this cast.<br> There's an afghan on the chair.<br> - Perfect.<br> - If that'll be all...<br> And some perfume.<br> Shalimar, on the dresser.<br> He loves Shalimar.<br> - He, who?<br> - Jack Trainer, who.<br> He's on his way over.<br> I have to go. Doctor's appointment.<br> One last thing? Run down<br> to the drugstore and get me my pills?<br> - I really have to go.<br> - The doctor will understand.<br> Thanks.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Jack.<br> - Katharine?<br> - In the bedroom.<br> Jack.<br> Katharine.<br> Boy, did I ever miss you.<br> - Does it hurt?<br> - Look at you.<br> - You said it was urgent, Kath.<br> - I'd forgotten how damn handsome you are.<br> Thanks. Look...<br> I meant what I said. I really am swamped...<br> Boy, some welcome home.<br> I haven't even gotten a kiss.<br> There's some champagne in the little fridge.<br> You wanna get it for us?<br> Sure. And then, I really do have to go.<br> - Where are the glasses?<br> - Try the dishwasher.<br> Here you are.<br> You know I love you, Jack. You know that.<br> Katharine, I really do have to get going.<br> These past few weeks, I've heard this<br> funny little sound, way deep down inside.<br> Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.<br> - My biological clock.<br> - Big deal going. Principals are all meeting...<br> And I've been thinking "Let's merge."<br> You and I.<br> Think of it, darling.<br> Mr and Mrs Fabulously Happy.<br> Katharine, it's really not a good time to talk.<br> You're right.<br> Can Big Jack come out to play?<br> - Little Jack really has to get going.<br> - Little Katie's been so lonely...<br> No. No. No.<br> Jack. What is it?<br> There's something I have to tell you.<br> There's someone else and I...<br> There's someone else?<br> Someone else that I have to be meeting<br> right now. Big deal going.<br> Can't be in two places at the same time.<br> Talk to you later. Bye.<br> Here we are.<br> OK, I've gotta run. Sorry. Bye.<br> Tess, you forgot your notebook.<br> That little slut.<br> Goddamn little bitch secretary.<br> Hi. I have a meeting with Mr Trask.<br> - Your name, please?<br> - Tess McGill.<br> All right. It's at the top of the stairs.<br> Miss McGill.<br> Good afternoon. Let me take your coat.<br> - Thank you.<br> - This way, please.<br> Thank you.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi. Is everything OK?<br> Yeah, yeah. You're the only one<br> from Petty here so far. What's going on?<br> - Flying solo on this.<br> - Good.<br> Old Armbrister and Trask are over there.<br> We're waiting to see what colour smoke<br> comes out of the chimney.<br> Tell me something. If a colleague of mine<br> had a strategy they needed help with,<br> - would you look at it if I asked you to?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> No ethics problem? You know,<br> open to accusations about stealing?<br> I look at stuff all the time.<br> Nobody's ever accused me of stealing.<br> What's it about?<br> I don't know. I'm so nervous,<br> I can't stand still.<br> You'll be fine.<br> I love you.<br> I love you too.<br> Gentlemen?<br> There was a story on the news last night<br> showing life imitating<br> an old children's riddle.<br> A truck got stuck at the entrance to the<br> Holland Tunnel. Too high for the clearance.<br> For hours, the experts tried to find some way<br> to unwedge the vehicle, but to no avail.<br> Finally, a 10-year-old girl in a passing car<br> suggested simply letting<br> the air out of the truck's tyres,<br> thus lowering it to the clearance level,<br> which they did.<br> And it worked.<br> Well, by letting some of the air out of<br> our strategy to expand into broadcasting,<br> Miss McGill and Mr Trainer have effectively<br> shown all of us here at Trask<br> the light at the end of our tunnel.<br> Gentlemen and ladies.<br> I've decided to sell Mr Trask<br> the Metro Radio System<br> for $68.5 million in cash and securities.<br> Now, of course, this is<br> an agreement in principle.<br> As to what constitutes principles<br> in this day and age,<br> I'm gonna leave that<br> up to you barracudas to squabble over.<br> I'm certain they'll want to hear this.<br> Miss, this is a closed meeting and you can't...<br> Thank God I'm here.<br> - What the hell is going on?<br> - You're being tricked. That's what's going on.<br> - Katharine, what...<br> - Jack, just trust me and sit down.<br> I'm Katharine Parker. I'm an associate partner<br> in Mergers and Acquisitions at Petty Marsh.<br> And this woman is my secretary.<br> - She's not.<br> - Oh, no? Ask her.<br> - You're not her secretary.<br> - I can explain, Jack.<br> Oh, Jesus. You are her secretary.<br> While I was laid up with broken bones,<br> she rifled through my desk, found my memo<br> outlining a Trask radio acquisition<br> and has been passing it off as her idea.<br> It was my idea. She stole it from me, I swear.<br> Good God, Tess.<br> Don't you know when to stop?<br> But you're lying.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you all so much.<br> The upside is that I have found out<br> in time to control the damage.<br> We have containment<br> and we have a deal on the table.<br> I say pass me a set of papers<br> and let's get on with it.<br> Who's running this thing?<br> Just a second, please.<br> I know you don't believe me, but...<br> It doesn't matter. I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<br> Well, gentlemen.<br> The players may have changed,<br> but the game remains the same.<br> The name of the game is "Let's make a deal".<br> If you all turn to page 22 in your prospectus,<br> I'll take you through the terms of transferral.<br> Well, they did it.<br> Yeah. They sure did.<br> You really look great.<br> - How are you?<br> - Good, good.<br> - Business is great and...<br> - Mick, did you see me?<br> I caught it one-handed.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey, Doreen.<br> And my boat's booked through three weeks<br> from now. Doreen's workin' the lines for me.<br> That's great. Really.<br> So how's life in the fast lane?<br> Well, it's fast.<br> It's real fast and busy and...<br> It's good to see you, Mick.<br> I guess I'd better get.<br> Yeah, it's good to see you too.<br> Cyn told us about what happened.<br> It really bites the big one, Tess. Really.<br> - We took up a little collection.<br> - Thanks.<br> It's not much. Just enough to go out and get<br> toasted some night when you really need it.<br> Don't say no. We really wanted to.<br> And no paying the Con Ed with it.<br> OK. Thanks.<br> So what are you gonna do now, huh?<br> You know... Play some golf,<br> redecorate the country house.<br> I don't know. Start all over.<br> Find a job, a place to live.<br> And just wise up and not take<br> the whole thing so seriously.<br> I'll be OK.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye, sweetie.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Miss you.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Bye, Tess.<br> - Don't work too hard.<br> - Bye, Tess.<br> Sorry.<br> - I've been trying to find you.<br> - Just leave me alone.<br> Just one thing. Was you and me<br> just part of the scheme too?<br> No.<br> If I'd told you I was just some secretary,<br> you never would've taken the meeting.<br> Think about it.<br> Maybe you'd have fed me a few drinks and<br> tried to get me into the sack. End of story.<br> - That's not true.<br> - Are you sure about that?<br> Can you honestly tell me it wouldn't have<br> made a difference? Who's fooling who here?<br> What's this? More stolen files?<br> No, it's my stuff from the desk.<br> - Your stuff? Now there's a broad term.<br> - No, it's my stuff.<br> Maybe you can fool these guys<br> with this saint act,<br> but do not ever speak to me again<br> like we don't know what really happened.<br> Tess, this is business.<br> Let's just bury the hatchet, OK?<br> You know where you can bury your hatchet?<br> Now get your bony ass out of my sight.<br> And if you really think that I said I loved you<br> as part of some scheme, then that is pathetic.<br> - My God. She'll stop at nothing.<br> - What kind of show are you people running?<br> Oren, I'm sorry you've had to see this,<br> but it means nothing to us.<br> Jack, let's get upstairs.<br> - Not without her.<br> - Jack.<br> Trainer, are you trying to blow this deal?<br> No, sir. I'm trying to make sure<br> that it gets done right.<br> Tess put this deal together.<br> We shouldn't proceed without her.<br> And you shouldn't go letting your johnson<br> make business decisions for you.<br> I'm not, sir. I'm telling you, she's your man.<br> - What brings you to that conclusion?<br> - She said so and I believe her.<br> I'm afraid that's not good enough.<br> Now, are you with us or not?<br> No.<br> Jack, I forgive you. Now get on this elevator.<br> - Sorry, Katharine.<br> - You will be sorry, Jack.<br> Ask her to tell you about<br> the hole in your deal.<br> - What hole?<br> - She's playing games. Let's get going.<br> - Fine. Go.<br> - No. What hole?<br> Look.<br> The People Page? Now, this is ridiculous.<br> "Former Miss America Dawn Bixby<br> has been house-hunting."<br> "Seems Dawn and hot, hot, hot<br> DJ hubby Slim Slicker<br> are getting ready to take<br> a bite out of the Big Apple."<br> - So?<br> - Slim Slicker's one of Metro's major assets.<br> Syndicated to all their stations.<br> The cornerstone of their programming.<br> Lose him and Metro's just<br> real estate with falling ratings.<br> And you're not buying it for a write-off.<br> Better make sure he's locked in<br> before they sign.<br> Oren, I have this covered. Upstairs. Shall we?<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> Hear the lady out, sir.<br> There's another elevator.<br> You're on.<br> OK.<br> This is Forbes. It's the basic article about how<br> you were looking to get into broadcasting.<br> OK, the same day, I'm reading the Post<br> and there's this item on Bobby Stein,<br> the radio guy who does those gross jokes<br> about Ethiopia and the Betty Ford Center.<br> Anyway, he's hosting this charity auction -<br> real blue bloods, and won't that be funny?<br> Now I turn the page to the society stuff<br> and there's a picture of your daughter.<br> Nice picture. And she's helping<br> to organise the charity ball.<br> So I started to think Trask, radio. Trask, radio.<br> And then I hooked up with Jack,<br> and he came on board with Metro,<br> and... and so now here we are.<br> Oren, we really don't have<br> any more time for fairy tales.<br> Miss Parker, let me ask you a question.<br> How did you come up the idea<br> for Trask to buy up Metro?<br> How did I...?<br> Well, let's see. The...<br> The impulse. What led you<br> to put the two together?<br> Well, I would have to check my files.<br> I can't recall exactly the...<br> Generally. It's not as if<br> it was in the mainstream.<br> You know, it would have to be the...<br> Jack, help me out here.<br> Oren, I beg your pardon,<br> but if you are insinuating...<br> Miss Parker, if I were you, I'd go to your office<br> and take a long last look around.<br> Because in about five minutes, I'm going<br> to see to it that you get the boot but good.<br> Oren, this is a simple misunderstanding.<br> I... You cannot...<br> I can and I will.<br> Now get your... What did you call it?<br> - Bony ass.<br> - Right.<br> ..bony ass out of my sight.<br> I'm sorry, but I simply<br> won't stand for that kind of talk.<br> Will you excuse me, please?<br> Why didn't you tell us all this<br> in the boardroom that day?<br> No one was gonna listen, sir. Not to me.<br> You can bend the rules upstairs,<br> but not while you're trying to get there.<br> And someone like me<br> can't get there without bending the rules.<br> You've got a real fire in your belly. Or was<br> this just a one-time stunt that you pulled?<br> I have something in my belly,<br> but I think it's nervous knots.<br> Are you willing to go out on that limb<br> every day, working for me?<br> - Legitimately?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Have to be at the entry level. Any problem?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Gumption, Miss McGill.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - See you tomorrow.<br> - OK.<br> Trainer, Dwayne. Let's go to my office<br> and see about Slim whatshisname's contract.<br> Be right with you, sir.<br> - Way to go, Tess. Way to go.<br> - Beauty.<br> For you. You like it?<br> Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br> Milk money.<br> Twinkies.<br> Pen, pencil, ruler. Apple for the teacher.<br> Remember. Play nice with the other kids<br> and make sure you're home before dark.<br> Hi. Tess McGill.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> The director is out sick today, so she'll<br> want to see you first thing tomorrow.<br> Miss Baxter's already up there.<br> She'll show you the layout.<br> - It's all the way at the end of the hall.<br> - All right. Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> Anybody'll be an improvement<br> over that terrorist.<br> I mean, something semi-human.<br> I didn't hear you come in.<br> - I'm Alice Baxter.<br> - Tess McGill.<br> I was just using the phone.<br> Yes, well, that happens.<br> - How about some coffee?<br> - Sure. Just tell me where.<br> No, I'll get it. How?<br> Milk and sugar, please.<br> Thank you.<br> - Miss McGill.<br> - Yes?<br> That's your desk, in there.<br> I don't think so.<br> Oh, yes. I sit out here.<br> I'm sorry. I thought<br> the secretary would sit out here.<br> That's right. I'm the secretary.<br> If it's OK, I prefer "assistant".<br> You've got a 10 o'clock meeting<br> with Slater from Development - here.<br> from Logistics - his office on 23.<br> And lunch with Mr Trask -<br> his office downtown, one o'clock.<br> It's all right there on the computer.<br> Just hit shift-S for your schedule.<br> When I saw you in here<br> on the phone with your feet up,<br> I figured this was your office.<br> I'm sorry about that, Miss McGill.<br> It won't happen again ever.<br> It's OK.<br> Maybe now would be a good time<br> to go over what you expect of me.<br> I... I expect you to call me Tess.<br> I don't expect you to fetch me coffee<br> unless you're getting some for yourself.<br> And the rest we'll just make up<br> as we go along.<br> OK?<br> OK.<br> - I'll be right outside if you need anything.<br> - Fine.<br> Cyn.<br> Guess where I am?<br>
