                        I call it a hit.<br> What'll your review say?<br> - I like it too, so I guess I'll pan it.<br> - That's logical.<br> My publisher resents Cohan<br> impersonating the president of the U.S.<br> Says our young readers dream<br> of being president.<br> "I'd rather be right than be president."<br> Cohan may find out he isn't either one.<br> - See how George does it at his age.<br> - I remember him when I was little.<br> Congratulations, George, old boy.<br> You did a great job.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Congratulations, Mr. Cohan.<br> - You had him down to a tee.<br> - But we're still on dangerous ground.<br> Imitating the president,<br> a lot of people won't like it.<br> It's good, clean fun.<br> Didn't they enjoy it in Boston?<br> Never could do anything wrong in Boston.<br> Greatest man in the U.S. Played by the<br> greatest actor. Nothing wrong with that.<br> Especially when the greatest actor<br> is my husband.<br> - This could be treason.<br> - A dollar-a-year man will take care of you.<br> A lot of them would like<br> to shoot actors.<br> Save these telegrams.<br> Government needs paper.<br> You've got a list with everybody<br> but Hirohito.<br> - We'll bring him in.<br> - Here's the one I sent.<br> - Will you read our cleverness?<br> - What makes you think I didn't?<br> I didn't know there was that much love left<br> in the entire Western Union codebook.<br> Hold that. Thank you. Thank you.<br> - Don't bother me.<br> - It's from the White House.<br> - Well, that bothers me.<br> - Here.<br> You read it.<br> These aren't my reading glasses.<br> "George M. Cohan,<br> The Alvin Theater, New York.<br> The president requests that you call<br> upon him at your earliest convenience...<br> ...in regard to a personal matter.<br> Kindly reply for definite appointment<br> at White House.<br> Stephen T. Early,<br> secretary to the president."<br> There you are, Sam.<br> There you are. What did I tell you?<br> Coming at a time like this,<br> with everything on his mind...<br> ...this is not just a casual invitation.<br> This is important.<br> - I think we're in trouble.<br> - Don't worry.<br> They don't telegraph you<br> to come and be shot at sunrise.<br> - He doesn't get up that early.<br> - I've got a run-of-the-play contract.<br> Fine time to make lame jokes.<br> I'm worried, Sam.<br> I'm really worried.<br> Halt!<br> - What can I do for you?<br> - I've got an appointment.<br> - The name, please?<br> - Cohan. George M. Cohan.<br> All right, sir. If you'll wait<br> just one moment, I'll call.<br> This is Sgt. Lewis<br> at the Pennsylvania Avenue gate...<br> - Good evening, Mr. Cohan.<br> - Good evening.<br> - We've been expecting you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Why, your coat's wet.<br> - Didn't you come in a car?<br> - No, I walked up from the station.<br> Washington's a great town to walk in.<br> Always get a kick out of it.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> Won't you come with me?<br> I was supposed to be off duty<br> this evening, Mr. Cohan...<br> ...but when I heard you was coming, I<br> thought I'd like to see if you look the same.<br> - That depends on when you saw me last.<br> - It must have been 30-some years ago.<br> I was valet for Teddy Roosevelt.<br> He got me a seat up in the gallery.<br> The play was George Washington Jr...<br> ...and you was just singing and dancing<br> all about the grand old flag.<br> Mr. Teddy used to sing it in his bathtub.<br> - It was a good old song in its day.<br> - It was.<br> And it's just as good today<br> as it ever was.<br> Come in.<br> Well, hello there.<br> How's my double?<br> Your double isn't too sure.<br> Give me time to work on that.<br> - I was told you knew all the answers.<br> - There was a time when I thought so.<br> - Right now, I wish I did.<br> - Yes, so do I.<br> - Sit down, Mr. Cohan.<br> - Thanks.<br> You know, I'm a little bit nervous.<br> - I'm sorry I missed the opening of your show.<br> - Maybe just as well.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> We understand each other perfectly.<br> I think so.<br> Herald Tribune says that you make a better<br> president in I'd Rather Be Right than I am.<br> Don't forget,<br> that's a Republican newspaper.<br> I can remember you and your family<br> very well. The Four Cohans.<br> Do you really?<br> That's a long time ago.<br> Yes. It was while I was<br> attending school near Boston.<br> I was a pretty cocky kid those days.<br> Pretty cocky kid.<br> A regular Yankee Doodle Dandy.<br> Always carrying a flag in a parade.<br> - I hope you haven't outgrown the habit.<br> - Not a chance.<br> That's one thing I always admired<br> about you Irish-Americans.<br> You carry your love of country like a flag,<br> right out in the open. A great quality.<br> I inherited that.<br> I got that from my father.<br> He ran away to the Civil War at 13. Proudest<br> kid in the whole state of Massachusetts.<br> So you've spent your life telling the<br> other 47 states what a great country it is.<br> I never thought of it that way before,<br> but that's about the size of it.<br> And I lost no time either.<br> It started with a very funny incident<br> about 60 years ago.<br> It was in Providence, Rhode Island,<br> on the 4th of July.<br> There weren't so many stars then,<br> in the flag or on the stage...<br> ... but folks knew more were coming.<br> They were optimistic,<br> happy and expectant.<br> The beginning of the Horatio Alger age.<br> My father played in a variety theater,<br> breaking in a single.<br> No one was more expectant than he was,<br> unless it was Mother.<br> She was busy on a smaller production.<br> - Message come yet?<br> - No word, Jerry.<br> - Take a bow.<br> - I can't. I gotta get out.<br> - Watch that border!<br> - I gotta find out what's happening.<br> Oh, for heaven's sake, Jerry.<br> Take up number three.<br> You're on. Go ahead. Lights up.<br> - Bye, Sally.<br> - You can't run through the streets in that.<br> - They'll put you in jail.<br> - They'll have to catch me.<br> - Don't forget, you're on again at 4:15.<br> - Don't worry, I'll be back.<br> - These things take hours sometimes.<br> - My wife never held up a show in her life.<br> - Can I get through here?<br> - The Irish are up in the head of the parade.<br> - I'm not in the parade. I wanna get through.<br> - Not a chance, brother.<br> You don't say!<br> We'll get you there in a jiffy.<br> Here, this'll give you courage.<br> Charge!<br> Nellie.<br> - She all right?<br> - She's fine.<br> What is it?<br> Well, all signs point to its being a boy.<br> He just got here,<br> and he's sleeping already.<br> All babies sleep 20 hours a day.<br> That's why most<br> never amount to anything.<br> - What'll we call him?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What do you say?<br> - Seeing that he arrived on the 4th of July...<br> ...what about George Washington Cohan?<br> Has a nice patriotic ring to it.<br> What do you think?<br> The George is fine, but the Washington<br> may be too long for a billboard.<br> How about a nice, short Irish name?<br> Dennis or Michael.<br> George Michael Cohan.<br> Yes, I like that name.<br> Gosh, I forgot.<br> Hey! It's a boy!<br> Oh, Jerry.<br> Heavenly day, Nellie,<br> he's crying with a brogue.<br> The first thing I ever had in my fist<br> was the American flag.<br> I hitched my wagon to 38 stars<br> and 13 stripes.<br> I was 6 or 7 before I realized they weren't<br> celebrating my birthday on the 4th of July.<br> Then my folks had a real break when<br> my little sister, Josie, made her entrance.<br> She grew to love show business<br> just as she loved everybody and everything.<br> We toured the kerosene circuit on a show<br> called Daniel Boone on the Trail.<br> Everybody doubled in brass.<br> Dad walloped the bass drum.<br> They teamed me with a donkey.<br> I was a good Democrat even in those days.<br> Mother and Josie threw out handbills.<br> Their smiles would've sold tickets<br> to wooden Indians.<br> They kept putting new stars in the flag, and<br> the Cohans kept rushing out to meet them.<br> We had jokes to match every cornfield.<br> We sang at every milk station.<br> We trouped through depression and inflation,<br> part of the country's growing pains.<br> Froze in winter, and roasted in summer.<br> But it was a good life.<br> It's a lucky family<br> that dances together every day.<br> 1891 found our fortunes<br> flat as a pancake.<br> Then came jobs for the whole family<br> in a show called Peck's Bad Boy.<br> We opened in Brooklyn.<br> The town was known for spirited audiences<br> even before it had a ball team.<br> - Hammering on opening night!<br> What are you doing here?<br> - I'm the star of this play.<br> - You have the leading part, yes.<br> That means I'm a star...<br> ...and there should be a star on my<br> dressing-room door. Law of the theater.<br> - Yes, Jerry, give the devil his due.<br> - I know, but I'm nervous.<br> I'll go blank.<br> I won't be able to remember a line.<br> Don't worry. If you stick,<br> I'll throw you the line. You too, Mother.<br> - It's to jail you're going, me boy.<br> - Oh, there.<br> Henry's not really a bad boy.<br> He's just mischievous, that's all.<br> Mr. Schults, that should take care<br> of the damage, don't you think?<br> Henry, I want you to promise<br> the cop and Mr. Schults...<br> ...that from now on,<br> you will always be a good boy.<br> I'll promise, but I can still lick<br> any kid in town!<br> - Fine work, Georgie.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Great, Georgie. Great!<br> - Nice going, kid.<br> - Real piece of acting there.<br> - Son, you're going places.<br> - Boy, you sure rolled them in the aisles.<br> - Thanks, but why are you surprised?<br> You could've told during rehearsals<br> that I'd be a sensation.<br> Listen, there's nothing<br> to this acting business.<br> I wonder what took me so long<br> to become a star.<br> Excuse me. Hey! Call rehearsal<br> for 10:00 tomorrow morning.<br> Jerry, the time has come<br> for George's first spanking.<br> That's right.<br> I'll hold him, you hit him.<br> Not me. I don't hit hard enough<br> to make an impression.<br> I can't do it. He'd think I'm jealous<br> because he got more laughs.<br> Don't think I'm not, either.<br> Several gentlemen to see you outside,<br> Mr. Cohan.<br> Gentlemen of the press, I presume.<br> It's started already.<br> Will you excuse me?<br> Let's see how tough he is!<br> Ought to be arrested,<br> every one of those hoodlums.<br> It seems to me you're taking this<br> very calmly, Jerry.<br> Your own son almost murdered<br> in cold blood.<br> The way I figure, it's a fine tribute<br> to Georgie's acting.<br> The way he plays the part,<br> every tough kid...<br> ...will want to take a punch<br> at Peck's Bad Boy.<br> What? Have I gotta go<br> through that every night?<br> Yes. And matinees Wednesdays<br> and Saturdays.<br> Georgie, those boys did you<br> a great favor...<br> ...and they saved me a lot of trouble.<br> Most actors give their whole lives<br> to their profession without scoring a hit.<br> You're lucky.<br> You're a hit at the age of 13.<br> I've been in this business a long time.<br> I've never met a performer...<br> ...who in the long run wouldn't rather<br> be a great guy than a great actor.<br> That is, until I made your acquaintance.<br> Can't I be both?<br> Chances are, the way you're going,<br> you won't be either.<br> If the hoodlums don't get you,<br> a committee of actors will.<br> Actors are considered a very bad risk<br> by insurance companies.<br> Any actor with a conceit like yours,<br> we just couldn't afford the premium.<br> What your father really means<br> is you're too sensitive.<br> You're too anxious to make good.<br> You love the theater too much.<br> Oh, I know you can improve<br> if you want to.<br> Sure I can. Just watch me.<br> From now on, I'm Peck's Bad Boy<br> only from 8:30 till 11 in the evening.<br> - That's a boy, Georgie.<br> - I promise, Mother.<br> And don't forget, Wednesdays<br> and Saturdays, 2:30 till 5.<br> Yes, sir. And the other 21 and a half hours,<br> I pattern myself after Dad.<br> Well, you could find a better example,<br> but that's the general idea.<br> Jerry, what do you know!<br> Ed Albee's coming backstage to see you.<br> - Albee!<br> - Albee! That's B.F. Keys' partner.<br> That's bigtime vaudeville!<br> We're big time!<br> He didn't send for us.<br> He's come here to see us!<br> It may be better<br> if I spoke business to him.<br> I thought you said<br> you were going to reform.<br> I'm sorry.<br> When he comes in,<br> I want you to keep quiet.<br> - Look at the condition of this dressing room.<br> - Get the cheap makeup off the table.<br> Hurry up!<br> Quick, Georgie!<br> Get the stuff off that shelf.<br> That's right.<br> Albee will be right in.<br> He just stopped at the water cooler.<br> If he offers you a cigar,<br> don't take it.<br> I'll take it. It'll impress him<br> if he thinks I can smoke.<br> - Get behind that curtain.<br> - But...<br> Hurry up! I don't wanna hear a word.<br> I don't want to even hear you breathe.<br> Josie, fix the chairs.<br> The other one.<br> Here, take this.<br> Oh, Jerry.<br> - Sit down, Nellie. Sit down.<br> - All right.<br> Come in.<br> Mr. E.F. Albee.<br> - Hello, Cohan.<br> - Albee. Meet Mrs. Cohan.<br> How do you do?<br> - Sit down, Mr. Albee.<br> - Thank you.<br> I saw your show tonight. Not bad.<br> Have a cigar?<br> No, thanks.<br> Your show's no good for vaudeville, but<br> I've seen a lot worse right here in Brooklyn.<br> We're opening a new theater in Philadelphia<br> on the 4th of July.<br> If you fix up a good vaudeville act...<br> ...we'll double your salary, give ten weeks'<br> guarantee and third or fourth billing.<br> - Double our salary?<br> - You'll be with the best variety artists.<br> Vesta victoria, Eddie Foy, Ward & vokes,<br> Lottie Collins, Charlie Case...<br> Just a second.<br> I'm George M. Cohan. You're opening<br> a theater in Philadelphia on July 4th?<br> - Yes, that's right.<br> - That's my birthday.<br> That isn't why we're opening the theater.<br> The salary's all right,<br> but how have you got the nerve...<br> ...to offer us third or fourth billing<br> after my performance tonight?<br> Is this kid in your show?<br> Am I in the show! Who do you think<br> was Peck's Bad Boy?<br> I beg your pardon.<br> I didn't quite recognize you.<br> You didn't? Then maybe you're not<br> the showman you're cracked up to be.<br> - George!<br> - George!<br> Well, now, maybe I'm not.<br> Maybe you're not quite ready<br> for the big time yet.<br> Mrs. Cohan. Mr. Cohan.<br> Good night.<br> Mr. Albee!<br> - How do you do, Mr. Albee?<br> - Good evening.<br> - Can I call you a carriage?<br> - Lf you will.<br> Carriage for Mr. Albee!<br> You see what happens<br> because you wouldn't lay a hand on him?<br> A mother doesn't do any punishing.<br> She gives her permission.<br> Have I your permission?<br> You certainly have.<br> Shouldn't you get my permission too?<br> - Not on the hand, he has to play the violin!<br> - All right, not on the hand.<br> Not on the mouth, he has to sing!<br> All right, not on the mouth.<br> Come here.<br> Here's one place without any talent!<br> - Who were Lewis and Clark, George?<br> - Acrobats?<br> - Look at this swell write-up we got.<br> - Write-up?<br> You found us whenever new states<br> sprouted on the prairie.<br> We played every town in America<br> that had a theater.<br> - Any mail for Mr. Cohan?<br> - No. Your father picked up his mail.<br> I mean for Mr. George M. Cohan.<br> The next 10 years rushed by<br> like a circus train.<br> Dad seemed content with the sticks,<br> but I was straining at the leash.<br> - Here's your mail, Mr. Cohan.<br> - Thanks.<br> Couple of tickets for the show.<br> We were playing stock in Buffalo.<br> And being versatile,<br> I was playing my mother's father.<br> - Oh, Daddy, he's left me.<br> - All is for the best, my daughter.<br> In life we trip, but right ourselves.<br> I was correct about man's love.<br> First, he considers his pleasure<br> or his honor or his purse.<br> Only secondly does he think<br> of the woman he says he loves.<br> Now I must go life's journey alone and<br> struggle on my weary way to find peace.<br> Courage, Emily, courage.<br> Living has taught your father<br> many things.<br> Among them,<br> to take the bitter with the better.<br> The road to happiness is paved<br> with heartaches and stones.<br> They're all yours, sweetheart.<br> Good luck, honey.<br> There's a young lady. One of those<br> stage-struck kids would like to talk to you.<br> Show her in.<br> All right, miss.<br> - Mr. Cohan will see you.<br> - Thank you.<br> He's all yours.<br> I'm 18. I sing and I dance,<br> and I'm going to New York.<br> Should I?<br> Oh, Mr. Cohan. You're so old,<br> and so experienced in the theater...<br> ...so fatherly.<br> Do you think it's wise?<br> I mean, my being 18, singing<br> and dancing, and going to New York.<br> Well, that's very wise.<br> I mean, being 18 is very wise.<br> As for New York, The Four Cohans<br> open there this fall with their new show...<br> ...with a new cyclorama<br> and two carloads of scenery.<br> - Really? When are you leaving here?<br> - Tomorrow night, right after the show.<br> Oh, I can't leave till Wednesday.<br> I graduate from high school Tuesday.<br> That's too bad.<br> Georgie... Excuse me. You haven't forgotten<br> we have a date tonight, have you?<br> Oh, no, no. Of course not.<br> We're going roller-skating.<br> Roller-skating on a night like this?<br> Why, there's a moon out.<br> I'll be ready in five minutes.<br> - Pipperino, isn't she?<br> - Yes. Is she your daughter?<br> - I'm not married.<br> - Your niece, perhaps?<br> She's just a kid with the show.<br> We've been dating.<br> Isn't she a little too young for you?<br> No. She's getting along in years.<br> She's 17.<br> Well, shall I sing for you?<br> I know I have talent,<br> even if I am from Buffalo.<br> We haven't got any piano handy.<br> Then I'll dance.<br> That's rather old, isn't it?<br> Everybody's done that.<br> You don't want to be just an imitator.<br> Oh, no.<br> Here's a step I made up myself.<br> But on the other hand, you don't want<br> to be too original, either, do you?<br> - No.<br> - I'll tell you what you do.<br> You sit right here,<br> and I will give you an idea of what I mean.<br> It may not be much. I'm not the dancer<br> I used to be, but then who is?<br> Now watch carefully, now.<br> Oh, no, no!<br> - Don't you like it?<br> - But your heart!<br> My heart is every bit as good<br> as it ever was.<br> Oh, so fast!<br> Such excitement at your age.<br> - Sit down and rest.<br> - Thanks.<br> Maybe I have overdone it a little.<br> Look at the perspiration on your brow.<br> Your wrinkles!<br> What happened to your wrinkles?<br> I do have to make up older<br> than I actually am.<br> How old are you?<br> Not yet 70.<br> You seem different from when I first came in.<br> Even your voice sounds younger.<br> It's a gift I have.<br> I'm always as young as the people I'm with.<br> And you've made me feel very young.<br> - Very young.<br> - I'm glad.<br> Now, let's make plans.<br> Which manager shall I take you to see first?<br> Erlanger? Good old Abe's a very nice fellow,<br> but maybe a little bit too soon.<br> Tony Pastor?<br> Well, that's better.<br> Albee, Coster, Beall and Proctor...<br> Wait a minute, little girl. Don't let an old<br> white beard and eyebrows frighten you.<br> In show business,<br> you'll see a lot of those.<br> I'm not sure I wanna go<br> into show business now.<br> A girl with your talent and ability? There<br> are very few who can sing, dance and act.<br> How do you know I can do those?<br> You've never seen me.<br> I don't have to see you.<br> I can tell a trouper a mile away.<br> I feel as though I've known you<br> for years. What's your name?<br> - Mary.<br> - That's a very pretty name.<br> Now, Mary, you calm down.<br> Let's go and have a bite to eat.<br> I always eat after the last show.<br> Are you hungry?<br> I've been sitting in the theater since 2:00<br> trying to get up courage to come backstage.<br> You must be hungry after seven shows.<br> We'll have a nice cold bottle and a bird.<br> What's a cold bottle?<br> That's what we in show business<br> call a piece of pie and a glass of milk.<br> Aren't you going roller-skating<br> with that pipperino?<br> I'm tired of picking her up.<br> What's the matter, darling?<br> Got it.<br> Pretty good.<br> There's a contract on my desk already<br> made out. Get it.<br> Hey!<br> If any of The Four Cohans ask how<br> you like their act, tell them it was fair.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> my mother thanks you.<br> My father thanks you.<br> My sister thanks you.<br> And I thank you.<br> - Nice going.<br> - That's tearing them out of their chairs.<br> All set up for you. Go get them.<br> After the way we went tonight<br> we're ready for New York.<br> If we're a hit here,<br> it's a cinch in New York.<br> - Nice going, kid.<br> - Thanks.<br> Oh, Mr. Cohan, just a minute.<br> Pretty fair act you folks have got.<br> - They seemed to like it.<br> - That's a soft audience.<br> - Got any open time?<br> - From now on.<br> - I'll make an offer.<br> - We'd be glad to talk.<br> Fine. Fine. You know, they're always a<br> soft audience here on Wednesday. Pushover.<br> - Did you catch it?<br> - Oh, you were wonderful, George.<br> - But I don't know, I miss that beard.<br> - Did you get up on that number?<br> It's a lovely song, George.<br> I've learned it by heart.<br> Good. I rehearsed it with the orchestra.<br> You'll do it this show.<br> He knows your key.<br> You just follow him for tempo.<br> But there's a notice. You can't<br> change your act after the first show.<br> The manager expects me to sing<br> "The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."<br> Who were they applauding,<br> the manager or me?<br> - Now go on out there and do it.<br> - Oh, George, I can't move.<br> I can't go out there,<br> not without rehearsal.<br> What are you worried about?<br> You're doing a George M. Cohan lyric<br> to a George M. Cohan melody.<br> - Yes, but it's my voice.<br> - A George M. Cohan discovery.<br> Nobody ever had a better start.<br> There's your introduction, go on.<br> Good luck, kid.<br> Ten consecutive weeks in New York.<br> That's the big time.<br> When you leave New York,<br> Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago...<br> - Just look at her.<br> - Excuse me.<br> What's going on here? Take your<br> makeup off. I'll be back in just a minute.<br> Bill, what is this? What's she singing?<br> Who told her to switch that number?<br> She's supposed to sing<br> "The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."<br> - Who told her to switch that number?<br> - I don't know.<br> You don't know!<br> Bring down that curtain! When she finishes<br> the chorus pull out the houselights.<br> Wait a second. See how that song goes.<br> - The song is gone. Pull out the lights.<br> - Don't do it, Charlie.<br> Say, who does she think she is? Who<br> does she think is running this theater?<br> The only reason I put her on was<br> because the dog act got drunk.<br> - It'll be all right in the morning.<br> - She was your idea.<br> - And a very good idea too.<br> - Now I know who got the dog act drunk.<br> Who, me? Why I've never been<br> in a saloon in my life.<br> Now look at that. Could you ask<br> for anything more than that?<br> Mr. Dietz, she's wonderful.<br> Don't you think so?<br> Don't do that! Don't do that!<br> Pull out the lights.<br> Pull down that curtain.<br> Get your props together, you're on next.<br> Start limbering up, you follow the jugglers.<br> You get that curtain up. You can't ring<br> down on a George M. Cohan song.<br> A George... oh, I see!<br> It's your song. You wrote it.<br> You can tell that by the applause.<br> Now, Mary, I want you to do an encore.<br> Do one more chorus and really do it.<br> Oh, no, you don't.<br> Young lady, listen.<br> If you're gonna try junk like that,<br> you'll do it on a split beat time.<br> But you'll not be singing<br> that in my theater.<br> You take a little tip from me.<br> Start packing.<br> If you've got any squawks, unload<br> them on me. I started all this.<br> Listen, squirt. Any more interference and<br> you'll be blacklisted in show business.<br> You won't be able to get<br> into a stage door of any theater.<br> What's more, as for those songs of yours...<br> ...they won't be played on a hurdy-gurdy.<br> - Are you trying to threaten me?<br> - Mary, don't pay any attention to him.<br> - Get me the key to your dressing room.<br> Drunk or sober, the dog act goes on<br> on the next show. And look here...<br> Bring down the curtain!<br> Cohan, you're fired! You're canceled.<br> You're washed up!<br> You and your whole family!<br> Oh, things were tough.<br> But at least I was in New York.<br> I had a trunk full of songs and play<br> scripts and a heart full of confidence.<br> I'm glad I had it.<br> I'm sorry, I can't use this, Cohan.<br> Youth needs confidence. I'd learned my job<br> the hard way, all over the United States.<br> Guys who'd never been past the corner<br> cigar store said my stuff was no good.<br> A kid had to believe<br> in himself to buck that.<br> - What do you think?<br> - I didn't like it. Didn't appeal to me.<br> What do you mean it didn't appeal<br> to you? I'm the senior partner.<br> - I make the decisions.<br> - Well, what did you think?<br> - It didn't appeal to me either.<br> - Which proves you have no ear for music.<br> He's got no ear for music. I'm the senior<br> partner. I have a wonderful ear for music.<br> - The libretto is a grand story, isn't it?<br> - I laughed all the way through it.<br> That's my cue. If Harold laughs<br> then I know it isn't funny.<br> Why don't you have Mr. Cohan sing?<br> Maybe you didn't like "Harrigan"...<br> ...because I haven't got much of a voice.<br> - I think you have a lovely voice.<br> - Don't you think so, Mr. Dietz?<br> - Yes. If you'd like a job answering phones...<br> Are you or are you not going<br> to produce my play?<br> If you think I'd put my wife's money<br> in that trash, you're crazy.<br> That's it, Mary. That's enough.<br> They've had their chance.<br> - Have you an appointment?<br> - Yes. I'm Sam Harris.<br> I want to see them<br> about this melodrama.<br> - We don't teach them their business.<br> - We're busy. We have no time.<br> You don't know it,<br> but your days are numbered.<br> You're making room for the likes of me.<br> Someday, Mr. Senior Partner...<br> ...you're gonna come to me and<br> admit you were wrong.<br> In 20 years of show business, I never<br> once admitted I was wrong.<br> - That's his department.<br> - And your wife's money...<br> - Excuse me. I have an appointment.<br> - Who are you?<br> My name's Sam Harris. I have a<br> melodrama here called Wildflower.<br> Wildflower.<br> One, two, three, four, five, six,<br> seven, eight, nine, ten. Horses.<br> Oh, and Indians.<br> Come on. Don't let a couple like that<br> get under your skin. No sense in crying.<br> - Buffalo is such a beautiful city.<br> - Is that what you're crying about?<br> It's a beautiful city,<br> but I hate to go back to it.<br> Don't worry, you won't have to.<br> I'll show them.<br> I'm gonna have my name posted and<br> plastered up and down Broadway.<br> Now, you stick along,<br> we'll whip them to a standstill.<br> - I never really thought of leaving.<br> - We'll make this business holler for help.<br> That's what we'll do. They'll all hear<br> from us. Every one of them.<br> I'm the senior partner.<br> I'll do the throwing out.<br> You don't have to throw me out.<br> I know the way.<br> That's the last time I'll<br> ever bring you a play.<br> That's my department.<br> I will take it to Clower and Erlanger.<br> They don't always think of box office.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Too expensive.<br> Didn't even read the second act. Probably<br> the biggest forest fire ever on a stage.<br> I think he's a little upset.<br> by this time in Buffalo.<br> The juggler just paid<br> three weeks back board.<br> Put him at the head of the<br> table so he doesn't reach.<br> Where shall I put the magician?<br> Until he's paid he sits at the foot<br> of the table with the Cohans.<br> - Starvation corner.<br> - And put the goulash at the head.<br> Keep everything but the noodles and<br> syrup out of the reach of the Cohans.<br> Noodles and syrup are just<br> enough to keep them alive.<br> Anybody who owes me two month's<br> board bill I just keep alive.<br> I don't have to wait on them.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening, madam.<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> From now on, this is your seat.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - And you, master magician...<br> ...you sit over there with the Cohans.<br> Madame, some day I hope you will give<br> me the pleasure of sawing you in half.<br> I just heard today that Hammerstein<br> was bringing over the Scotch actor.<br> Harry Lauder at 2500 bucks a week.<br> Hammerstein's a great showman. A lot<br> of people have never seen a Scotchman.<br> Take some goulash, Mrs. Cohan.<br> Did you have that appointment<br> with that man about your booking?<br> Oh, yes. He's gonna give work<br> to the act any day now.<br> What happened to that Boston offer?<br> That was a mighty sweet proposition.<br> Four weeks' guarantee, $300 a week,<br> and top billing.<br> Well, we didn't take it.<br> You see, it just wasn't right.<br> Any act that lays off as long as<br> you have, any offer's all right.<br> - Butter?<br> - Thanks.<br> We just thought we'd rest<br> a few more weeks.<br> Yes, my brother's writing some new<br> material. We're just not ready to open.<br> You're not fooling anybody.<br> Everybody knows that you, Nellie and<br> Josie can get work anytime, any place.<br> But nobody wants Georgie.<br> He's made trouble in every theater<br> this side of San Francisco.<br> You can't lay off just because every<br> manager in town has blackballed Georgie.<br> His family hasn't blackballed him.<br> We may take a lot of hard knocks and<br> make a lot of sacrifices...<br> ...but if they want our act, they'll take him<br> too. We're not breaking up our act or family.<br> All right, all right. Let the blackballs<br> fall where they may.<br> Madame Bartholdi,<br> champagne for everybody!<br> - Swell.<br> - Even if I had it, who would pay?<br> Dietz & Goff. They're producing<br> Little Johnny Jones.<br> - George, really?<br> - They went crazy about the book.<br> Dietz said to heck with his wife's<br> money. He's gonna use his own.<br> Second round of champagne on me, if<br> you had it. Pass that goulash down.<br> Oh, George. Think of those billboards.<br> Book, music and lyrics all by<br> George M. Cohan.<br> - Oh, Georgie, l...<br> - Take it easy, Josie.<br> There's enough water on the goulash now.<br> Dad, I'm gonna be tied in rehearsal<br> for the next few months.<br> Why don't you and Mom and Josie<br> take other offers in the meantime.<br> Well, I hate to see the act split up,<br> but if you think so.<br> Oh, sure. Play all that stuff<br> around Chicago for Sullivan.<br> - The money's good. The jumps are short.<br> - Good idea. You get tired resting too long.<br> But it won't be the same going back<br> on the road without you, Georgie.<br> We'll be like a carriage<br> with only three wheels.<br> But you will admit I was a bumpy wheel.<br> You'll roll along easier without me.<br> - No, Georgie, no.<br> - You will.<br> If there's a part for a bicycle rider, I<br> used to be known as "venus on Wheels."<br> I always knew you weren't a cook.<br> - How's everything going, George?<br> - Not so good. Not so good.<br> I've been pounding the pavement<br> so long my socks have bunions.<br> - Mac, would you put a head on that?<br> - You bet I will.<br> The villain turns and says:<br> "I'll tell who you are unless<br> you help me hold up this train."<br> Think fast. It's due in 10 minutes.<br> You'll have the audience standing.<br> I know, I know. The hero helps him.<br> Gets shot in the leg.<br> - And the girl nurses him back to health.<br> - No. He gets shot in the arm, not the leg.<br> - Do you know what happens?<br> - I won't be in the theater to find out.<br> I will be on the street watching<br> a musical comedy.<br> Before I put $ 10,000 into a show...<br> ...it must have songs, dances,<br> and a lot of girls.<br> Women, women. Little rose petals.<br> The big scene is where the hero saves<br> the girl from a burning forest fire.<br> It won't be terribly expensive.<br> I know where I can get a cheap fire.<br> You don't need much of a fire.<br> Just enough to burn that manuscript.<br> - I've been looking all over town for you.<br> - What?<br> We gotta go to Dietz & Goff<br> and sign papers.<br> - Papers?<br> - What papers?<br> - What papers?<br> - I see. You don't want to talk about it.<br> - You haven't discussed our musical?<br> - Musical?<br> - Remember what we promised.<br> - I haven't said a word.<br> Good. Dietz said it was the best musical<br> he's read. Even allowed Goff to agree.<br> When I told him about those 20 ponies<br> and 20 showgirls all coming...<br> - Ponies and showgirls?<br> - Just a minute...<br> ...would you tell me what<br> you're talking about?<br> - You got the check?<br> - Yes.<br> - That's mine.<br> - No, no, no. We won't argue about it.<br> - Glad to have met you.<br> - That's minor.<br> - Come on. We can't keep Dietz waiting.<br> - You are a fine guy.<br> You have girls up your sleeve, you have<br> ponies and showgirls and you don't tell me?<br> - What's it about?<br> - We gave our word to Dietz.<br> We haven't got time.<br> It's about Todd Sloan.<br> - The famous jockey.<br> - Yeah. Come on.<br> Jockey sounds swell.<br> Just my luck to miss out on it.<br> Well, good luck, boys.<br> You forgot your manuscript. Say, before<br> we sign up with Dietz & Goff...<br> ...I made some change in<br> the lyric of "Yankee Doodle."<br> - "Yankee Doodle"?<br> - You shouldn't have. It was perfect.<br> You'll like this.<br> It gives the number added value.<br> - May I listen a little?<br> - Think we should?<br> - Well, I don't know.<br> - Lf you promise to be quiet.<br> - I promise.<br> - All right. Come on.<br> - There's a piano in the private room.<br> - "Yankee Doodle." "Yankee Doodle."<br> - Yankee Doodle Candy.<br> - Dandy. "Yankee Doodle Dandy."<br> Yankee Doodle Candy.<br> Thank you. Yankee Doodle Candy.<br> I have heard enough.<br> I will never forgive you for trying<br> to pawn a forest fire on me...<br> ...when you had that musical.<br> - Yes, but we gave our word to Dietz.<br> I can't understand it. Why is Dietz's wife's<br> money better than my wife's money?<br> Why?<br> Must you give it to Dietz & Goff?<br> Must you give it?<br> Well, I don't know. I like Dietz,<br> but I'm not too fond of Goff.<br> I'm crazy about Goff but<br> haven't got any use for Dietz.<br> Gentlemen, you are in perfect agreement.<br> - I will give you a check to bind the deal.<br> - Here.<br> - Thank you. What's your partner's name?<br> - I don't know.<br> What's my partner's name?<br> Well, don't toy with the kid at a time<br> like this. Tell him. George M. Cohan.<br> George M. Cohan. C-o-H-A-N.<br> - And what is my junior partner's name?<br> - Sam H. Harris. Shake.<br> - Hello. What should I write?<br> - Cohan and Harris.<br> Cohan and Harris.<br> That's it, ladies and gentlemen,<br> it's all over.<br> Yankee Doodle let them down.<br> So they'll either pasture him in clover or<br> have him hauling rubbish in London town.<br> Women, women. Little rose petals.<br> It's wonderful. You got them<br> eating from your hand.<br> - My congratulations.<br> - Thanks.<br> - As long as those critics don't eat my leg.<br> - Don't worry.<br> You have a smash hit. It's in the air.<br> You can't stop anything that's in the air.<br> All right. On the boat.<br> Remember, Jones, watch for the<br> skyrocket. If it goes off, you'll know...<br> ...that I've obtained papers that'll prove<br> you innocent of throwing the Derby.<br> It'll mean complete vindication. So stick<br> on the pier and watch for the skyrocket.<br> Thanks, pal. I'll be watching.<br> Goodbye, Johnny. And don't worry,<br> we still believe in you.<br> - Thanks, kid. That'll help a lot. Bye-bye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> That was your department!<br> Is it the robin that heralds the first<br> breath of spring?<br> How can you think of robins in the<br> spring when we're freezing in Illinois?<br> Hey, Jerry. Did you see the way<br> they're billing you in Waukegan?<br> - Come here. Look at that. Funny, isn't it?<br> - "Jerry, Nellie and Josie Cohan...<br> ...family of George M. Cohan,<br> the Broadway sensation."<br> - Hey, the kid's doing all right.<br> - Look at that.<br> Well, that's true. He is<br> the biggest thing on Broadway.<br> I know, but it ain't right.<br> We can build our own reputation.<br> - We'll be billed as The Three Cohans.<br> - All right. No need to get excited.<br> Don't think I'm jealous of Georgie's<br> success. Even though I am a better actor.<br> Of course you're not jealous.<br> Everybody knows that.<br> There'll be no stopping George. All he<br> needs is experience and he'll be a genius.<br> He mustn't know I'm a better actor.<br> It might interfere.<br> Still, it does look a little funny,<br> George being the toast of Broadway...<br> ...and you folks gathering crumbs<br> in the tank towns.<br> - Is either of you fellows Jerry Cohan?<br> - I am.<br> It's from George.<br> "Lmpossible to find three clever actors<br> named Cohan for my new show...<br> ...anywhere in New York.<br> - Return immediately for rehearsals."<br> - What'd I tell you?<br> The four of us back together<br> again. And on Broadway!<br> Even in the kitchen<br> you sound like a Tetrazzini.<br> In Buffalo they say I have a nice little voice.<br> A lot they know in Buffalo.<br> In Buffalo they thought I was an old man.<br> - Well, how do you like your part so far?<br> - Oh, I like it.<br> It's small.<br> I'd be afraid to try anything bigger.<br> You got something on the leading lady,<br> the best song in the show.<br> Here it is. It's finished.<br> - Come on.<br> - Well, what about the lyrics?<br> I'm gonna give it to you now.<br> Sit down and give me a pickup.<br> Yeah.<br> Gee, I never cared much<br> for my name before.<br> It's kind of common.<br> Gee, there are millions of Marys around.<br> I didn't write it for the millions of Marys.<br> I wrote it for one particular,<br> very special Mary.<br> It's a wonderful feeling<br> having your name written in music.<br> - Not bad music either, huh?<br> - Nope, it isn't.<br> How will everybody know I'm the Mary?<br> I want to make sure that everybody<br> knows it was written for me.<br> They'll know, all right.<br> When they look at you singing that song<br> and then look at me looking at you...<br> ...they'll know.<br> - Oh, George.<br> - Take it up an octave.<br> - George.<br> - Better.<br> Excuse me for butting in,<br> I've been looking all over town for you.<br> Strange that I should find you here.<br> Hello, Mary.<br> George has just written me a new song<br> for the show. Think I'll be able to do it?<br> Of course.<br> You've got a nice little voice.<br> That is not a little voice.<br> You need an ear trumpet.<br> We've got to go. We've got to see<br> Fay Templeton before she goes on.<br> - What does she want to see us about?<br> - We want to see her.<br> You need a leading lady,<br> you've got your ingnue.<br> - George!<br> - Fay Templeton, not bad.<br> If she can do two years in the turkey<br> she's in, she can do four for us.<br> - Will she take it?<br> - I don't know.<br> - At least you can get her autograph.<br> - Or she can get mine.<br> - Bring her back to supper after the show.<br> - We will, if she's still speaking to us.<br> A flower, mister?<br> - Here you are.<br> - Would you like to buy it?<br> Thank you.<br> One thing in our favor<br> is Erlanger's on our side.<br> - He's got influence with Miss Templeton.<br> - You take Erlanger and I'll tackle Templeton.<br> You don't tackle a star like Miss Templeton,<br> you approach her and very tactfully.<br> Well, if it's tact that does it, it's done.<br> If you get me in to see Miss Templeton<br> I'll get you passes to my next show.<br> Look, Dietz.<br> Looks naked without Goff.<br> - Where's Miss Templeton's dressing room?<br> - Upstairs.<br> Tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna see<br> that Miss Templeton gets your flowers.<br> My respects to Mrs. Dietz.<br> Now that was a very sweet gesture.<br> You've got to remember,<br> Fay, we're having a tough time...<br> ...lining up a vehicle for you.<br> Now, you should listen to this man.<br> - He's just written a big hit.<br> - One hit.<br> He may be a flash in the pan,<br> for all we know.<br> And I heard about Little Johnny Jones.<br> And I read the critics.<br> Of all the loud, vulgar, flag-waving...<br> Well, it was a wow.<br> I haven't laughed so much in years.<br> That fellow's got the golden touch.<br> Maybe so, but not for me, Mr. Erlanger.<br> What I want is a quiet,<br> dignified musical play.<br> I want to perform in a theater,<br> not a boiler factory.<br> Come in.<br> - Hello, Harris. How are you, Cohan?<br> - Hello, Abe.<br> - Everything's all right. She'll see you.<br> - That's fine.<br> - Fay, may I present Mr. Harris?<br> - How do you do?<br> And Fay, this is Mr. Cohan.<br> George M. Cohan.<br> How do you do?<br> We were just talking about you.<br> Miss Templeton's never seen your work.<br> Been sick or in Europe?<br> No. I've been right here<br> on this stage for two years.<br> Oh, buried.<br> Don't misunderstand me,<br> Miss Templeton.<br> Well, I've never been<br> at a loss for words before...<br> ...but right now, standing<br> in your presence, why, I hardly...<br> Well, I'd prefer to have<br> these flowers speak for me.<br> - Why, Mr. Cohan, how sweet of you.<br> - It was nothing at all. It's something...<br> Excuse me for breaking in on you,<br> Miss Templeton...<br> ...but I would like to present<br> my own flowers, my own way.<br> Mr. Cohan, I thought...<br> - Drunk.<br> - Is he?<br> May I have the honor of supping with you<br> at Rex's tonight after the show...<br> ...and drinking champagne out of your...<br> Pardon me, slipper?<br> Mr. Dietz, haven't you forgotten that<br> your junior partner does all the drinking?<br> Yes, but on special occasions I take over.<br> - May I put these in water for you?<br> - Well, really, l...<br> I never saw Dietz drunk before.<br> - Well, shall we get down to business?<br> - Lf you like, Abe.<br> George, how would you like to do a play<br> with one of the biggest stars in America?<br> What do you think I've been doing?<br> You see what I mean, Fay?<br> Isn't he a card?<br> Positively a riot.<br> Yes, well.<br> George, what's your new story like?<br> That is, I mean, can you write<br> a play without a flag?<br> Miss Templeton, I can write a play<br> without anything except a pencil.<br> - Laugh. Well, look...<br> - There's really no use discussing anything.<br> I'm afraid I would never please the people<br> who revel in your antics and fireworks.<br> You're being modest, Miss Templeton.<br> If you'd let yourself go, you'd be<br> just as entertaining as the rest of us.<br> You might even have fun yourself.<br> Abe, isn't it about time<br> for the curtain to go up?<br> If you haven't time now,<br> maybe you'll give us time after the show?<br> I'm sorry, after the show<br> I'm going home to New Rochelle.<br> It's only 45 minutes from here.<br> Thank heavens, it's like a thousand miles...<br> ...from all the noisy,<br> neurotic people in our profession.<br> - Now, Miss Templeton, you can't...<br> - Fay, I wanted...<br> That tact of yours, that wonderful tact.<br> What are you thinking about?<br> - Well, have you thought it over, Fay?<br> - I'm not interested in Mr. Cohan or his plays.<br> Now, you're making a great mistake.<br> He's the most original thing on Broadway.<br> You know why? Because he's the whole<br> darn country squeezed into one pair of pants.<br> His writing, his songs,<br> why even his walk and his talk.<br> They all touch something<br> way down here in people.<br> Don't ask me why it is, but it happens<br> every time the curtain goes up.<br> - It's pure magic.<br> - I'm bored by magic.<br> I know his formula. A fresh young sprout<br> gets rich between 8:30 and 11:00 p.m.<br> Yes, that's just it, Fay.<br> George M. Cohan has<br> invented the success story...<br> ...and every American loves it because<br> it happens to be his own private dream.<br> He's found the mainspring<br> in the antique clock.<br> Ambition, pride, patriotism.<br> That's why they call him<br> the Yankee Doodle Boy.<br> Now, if you'll take a tip from me<br> you'll do just what I'm doing.<br> You'll hitch your wagon<br> to his star right now.<br> Abe, I've got to change for the second act.<br> Fay, don't make up your mind too quickly.<br> Take a little time to think it over.<br> Who's locked my door?<br> - Who is it?<br> - What's going on here?<br> He'll be through in a minute.<br> Excuse me, Miss Templeton,<br> I didn't realize who you were. Come in.<br> - May I?<br> - Well, of course.<br> What does this mean?<br> Mind telling me why you're still here?<br> - It's ready and waiting and dedicated to you.<br> - What?<br> When you made that speech you said<br> you lived 45 minutes from Broadway.<br> That struck me as a perfect title<br> for a show and a song.<br> During the first act<br> you've written this new song?<br> - Strange surroundings, so it took longer.<br> - He's worked so hard. At least hear him.<br> - It'll only take a minute, won't it?<br> - Depends on the encores.<br> Well, you certainly are persistent.<br> All right, go ahead.<br> - Mind if I change?<br> - Thank you, Miss Templeton.<br> Thank you very, very much.<br> Go ahead, George, play it.<br> That's good. It's rather different.<br> You like it, Miss Templeton, do you?<br> Excuse me!<br> That's only a chorus number.<br> He's got one number called "Mary"<br> that's just perfect for you.<br> - She doesn't sing that.<br> - She is going to!<br> Shut up. Wait till you hear this,<br> it's the best thing he's ever done.<br> "Mary"?<br> This looks very interesting.<br> - You wouldn't like it.<br> - Lf it's like "45 Minutes From Broadway"...<br> - Well, it isn't, and besides...<br> - George!<br> - Don't spoil everything.<br> - She can't have that.<br> - You gotta let her have it.<br> - She's gonna sing it!<br> - She can't sing it!<br> - She will sing it.<br> With Abe's money and your brains<br> we'll be able to make a million.<br> Come in.<br> A little early for Christmas, isn't it?<br> Well, I was just passing the flowers<br> and they threw in the candy.<br> George, I'm sure our song will live forever.<br> I've been playing it since you left<br> and the neighbors haven't complained once.<br> What happened with Fay Templeton?<br> Oh, she's dying to play the part,<br> but I haven't made up my mind yet.<br> - Ham or bacon?<br> - Bacon.<br> Good, ham makes me self-conscious.<br> You're hesitating about having<br> Fay Templeton in your show?<br> Big stars are always temperamental<br> and hard to get along with.<br> Asking impossible terms and conditions.<br> I'll take my coffee black.<br> - I think you ought to give in to her.<br> - But, darling.<br> - No matter what she asks?<br> - No matter what she asks.<br> Why are you so concerned<br> with Fay Templeton?<br> I don't care for her,<br> I'm looking out for you.<br> Think what it means for you<br> to have a star like Templeton in your show.<br> Always worried about me, aren't you?<br> Ever think about yourself?<br> Not much lately. Haven't had time.<br> The minute I saw you without your beard...<br> ...I knew here was a little boy<br> who needed a lot of looking after.<br> So I gave myself the job.<br> There are a lot of singers, you know,<br> but very few really good looker-afters.<br> Darling, how would you like<br> a lifetime job of looking after?<br> Leading lady, run of the play. Maybe a few<br> heartaches after the curtain goes up...<br> ...but I can guarantee you some laughs.<br> - How does it sound?<br> - I think I might like it, Mr. Cohan.<br> Could I see some of the script?<br> Not bad for a first reading.<br> The coffee's boiling over.<br> - Darling, something I forgot to tell you.<br> - Yes, dear?<br> I gave your song to Fay Templeton tonight.<br> Darling, did you hear me?<br> - I gave your song to Fay Templeton tonight.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> I knew you did, dear, when you<br> brought the candy and flowers.<br> It's a wonderful song, George.<br> Best you've ever done. It'll live for years.<br> Thanks, Sam, but I still think<br> Mary should have sung it.<br> Oh, that's all right.<br> Fay has the song, but I have the author.<br> Look at Cohan.<br> He's got them lined up at the box office.<br> I've never seen the guy and his name<br> all over the place, look at that.<br> "Cohan and Harris present<br> George Washington Jr.<br> Starring the author and composer<br> George M. Cohan."<br> I wonder what the M is for?<br> Oh, modesty.<br> - Hello, Mr. Foy.<br> - How are you?<br> - Enjoyed your show last night.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You always appear in the kind of stuff I like.<br> - Thank you. That's very nice of you.<br> "George M. Cohan and his royal family.<br> Books and lyrics, music and directed by<br> George M. Cohan. Printed by Sam Divensky."<br> That must be Cohan's alias.<br> Certainly gave himself good billing,<br> this George M. Cohan.<br> You don't have to memorize it,<br> they're all over town.<br> I'd like to forget it. Hey, fella,<br> you connected with this turkey?<br> - You think it's a turkey? I hear it's good.<br> - That's a malicious rumor to gyp the public.<br> Who is this Cohan? Where is he from?<br> - Is he an upstart?<br> - He's been through the mill.<br> Played everything: Bigtime vaudeville,<br> rep shows, even followed dog acts.<br> Must have looked like an encore.<br> Say, is he as good as Foy?<br> - Who?<br> - Foy, Foy. Eddie Foy.<br> - Oh, pardon me.<br> - Pardon me, I didn't quite catch the name.<br> - Would you mind spraying it again?<br> - Eddie Foy.<br> The star with the big show down the street<br> with a chorus of 70.<br> Why, I thought they looked<br> a little younger than that.<br> I hear now that Cohan's in town,<br> Foy's gonna retire.<br> Foy won't retire till he's 90.<br> Will it take him that long<br> to discover he has no talent?<br> I hear when he tries to sing<br> the orchestra puts up umbrellas.<br> Tries to sing? Why, he's a genius.<br> He keeps his audience glued to the seats.<br> That's one way to keep them in the theater.<br> Cohan does it with talent.<br> He produces his own plays,<br> writes his own books, lyrics and music...<br> ...plays the leads, and is a great dancer.<br> - He dances, eh? When does he practice?<br> When you write your own plays you don't<br> have to practice. Cohan's done all right.<br> He's given the world Yankee Doodle Dandy.<br> What's Foy done for his country?<br> He gave them seven kids.<br> - Does he dance?<br> - One of the best.<br> When does he get time to practice?<br> Say, listen, young fella,<br> my name's Eddie Foy.<br> I know it. I'm George M. Cohan.<br> Oh, so you're Cohan?<br> Well, if I said anything accidental<br> to make you mad, I'm darn glad I did.<br> I don't blame you. I'd feel the same way<br> if I were up against Cohan.<br> - What do you like to drink?<br> - Oh, Moxie.<br> I can supply it.<br> The attraction inside is bigger than I am.<br> Come and see it when your show closes.<br> We took the red from the flame of dawn.<br> The dawn of a new nation.<br> And the white was the white<br> of the snow at valley Forge.<br> The blue was the blue of the free, open sky.<br> And the stars were<br> the 13 sisters by the sea...<br> ...who built their home<br> and called it "Liberty."<br> Right!<br> Right again!<br> That's the spirit!<br> And that government of the people...<br> ... by the people,<br> for the people shall not perish...<br> ... from the earth.<br> May I have your autograph, Mr. Cohan?<br> To what do you attribute<br> your continued success, Mr. Cohan?<br> Oh, I'm an ordinary guy who knows<br> what ordinary guys like to see.<br> Front row center, the greatest<br> show on earth, the people.<br> To the people. God bless them.<br> Here, chick, chick, chick, chick!<br> Oh, it's such fun, Mother,<br> having cows and chickens.<br> Everything's running so smoothly.<br> It's always been a dream of ours, Mary.<br> We kept hoping for 20 years<br> it might come true someday.<br> Imagine knowing how to feed chickens,<br> or how much to feed them.<br> And you're a farmer only three weeks.<br> Jerry and I've seen<br> a lot of chickens in train windows...<br> ...and we always wanted some of our own.<br> You know, watch them hatch<br> and feed them, and eat them.<br> If we only could. They're so pretty.<br> - Georgie?<br> - Yeah?<br> - What'd you get Dad for his birthday?<br> - Nothing much, just a smoking jacket.<br> - Is it bright? Will he like it?<br> - It's silk, and very red, and very yellow.<br> - That'll do it. Look what I got him, Georgie.<br> - Now, there's a present.<br> - That must have set you back.<br> - Dad needed a new watch.<br> His old one's so loud,<br> you can hear it right through his coat.<br> My future husband helped me pick it out.<br> Your future what?<br> Husband. We're getting married<br> as soon as Fred's road tour is over.<br> So Little Josie's gonna get married, huh?<br> It doesn't seem that long ago...<br> - What happens to The Four Cohans?<br> - Oh, just a simple case of subtraction.<br> You know, one from four leaves three.<br> Three Cohans.<br> That's only arithmetic.<br> One Cohan from Four Cohans<br> leaves nothing.<br> Mom and Pop know?<br> Mom's been working on<br> the wedding dress for weeks.<br> What are you thinking about, Georgie?<br> I'm going to write you the most<br> terrific wedding march ever put on paper.<br> It'll pack the pews.<br> Dad, tell Josie just because she's getting<br> married that's no reason to break up the act.<br> We're just as much an institution<br> as marriage is.<br> No one knows that any better than I do...<br> ...but we want to settle down<br> and raise a family.<br> What's the matter, can't he raise a family<br> and be a stage manager too?<br> Oh, George.<br> George, I'm afraid your mother and I are<br> breaking up the act before Josie is.<br> You hear that?<br> All three of them, walking out on me.<br> - Well, it's been a 40-year run, remember.<br> - We're giving our two weeks' notice, George.<br> All we'd like to do now is spend<br> the rest of our days here on this farm.<br> You can't do that. You can't put an actor<br> out in the grass, fresh air kills him.<br> We've gained nearly 10 pounds apiece.<br> You can work it off,<br> the show's ready for rehearsal.<br> - They're grand parts in it for both of you.<br> - No, George, I...<br> We've had good times together.<br> Well, new shows need new faces<br> and new feet to go with you.<br> From now on, it's just you alone, son.<br> - Well, what's this?<br> - A surprise, Dad.<br> - Happy birthday!<br> - Happy birthday, Mr. Cohan!<br> - Here we are.<br> - Which one do you want to open first?<br> - Make your wish.<br> - I have.<br> Good one, Dad.<br> - Which should I open first?<br> - How about opening this one?<br> I'll open this one, you open that one.<br> - This will match your new suit.<br> - I think someone gave me that last year.<br> - It looks fine.<br> - It looks grand.<br> It's made from that old backdrop you<br> like so well. Fireproofed and everything.<br> - Oh, darling, that's a lovely watch.<br> - I'm so glad you like it, Dad.<br> - This is better than being on next to closing.<br> - The only trouble is it's three minutes fast.<br> Dad, press the little button on the side<br> and see what happens.<br> It plays "one on one"<br> and segues into "Dixie."<br> - Here's more ties that you won't like, Jerry.<br> - Well, I'll have to open up a store.<br> - Here's a letter from George.<br> - Don't read it now. That's between us.<br> You haven't written me in 20 years.<br> I'll open it now and read it.<br> George, this isn't your party.<br> Now sit down and let him read his letter.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Come on, Dad.<br> Probably only a bill for his jacket anyway.<br> "Dear Dad, this is your 62nd birthday,<br> and God bless you.<br> Maybe I've never told you before,<br> but no son ever had a better dad...<br> ...or one to be prouder of.<br> You and Mother have always given me<br> more love and understanding...<br> ...than I ever deserved.<br> And all the luck I've had is due<br> to the things you two have taught me.<br> Nothing I can do could<br> ever repay the debt...<br> ...but here's a little present<br> for you and Mother.<br> From this day on,<br> you and I are partners...<br> ...in every theater and<br> theatrical property I possess.<br> Half and equal.<br> The Cohan Theater,<br> the Astor, the Gaiety...<br> ...and the Grand opera House in Chicago.<br> And all my plays and songs,<br> as long as they...<br> ...or you and I, live."<br> These are not my reading glasses.<br> Why didn't somebody give me<br> some reading glasses for my birthday?<br> "Wish you all my love.<br> Your son and partner,<br> George."<br> Well, George, on behalf<br> of your mother and myself, l...<br> There she goes, stealing the scene again.<br> One success followed another.<br> But there was one challenge I hadn't met.<br> Critics said musicals and cheap<br> comedies were all I could write.<br> I'd wave a flag, they said.<br> Nothing else.<br> So I wrote a legitimate drama.<br> Very deep and very significant.<br> No music, no gags, no flag-waving.<br> I called it Popularity.<br> The title showed how hard I was hoping.<br> I couldn't attend the opening because I was<br> appearing in The Yankee Prince.<br> - Open it up.<br> - Keep it closed, Buck.<br> Cohan, you're surely not going<br> to your dressing room now.<br> - You're good for another five curtain calls.<br> - That's enough for tonight.<br> - Mr. Cohan, are you sure you're feeling well?<br> - I feel all right.<br> - Any news on Popularity?<br> - No, but they should be ringing down now.<br> You'd think Sam would let me know.<br> Well, it's a good sign. They probably<br> couldn't tear themselves away.<br> - What time is it?<br> - 7:30, sir.<br> - That clock right?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Wonder what's keeping them.<br> They ought to be here by now.<br> Maybe something's wrong.<br> Got the reports on the minstrel show.<br> - What'd we lose this week?<br> - Oh, 10,000, more or less.<br> - What's the total loss so far?<br> - A few dollars under 200,000.<br> That include the cost of the red ink?<br> Popularity better be a hit.<br> A lot of dough sunk into that too.<br> Eddie, find out what's keeping them.<br> - What did the papers say about the show?<br> - Here they are. Rave notices again.<br> Rave notices. That's bad.<br> The better notices you get,<br> the more it costs you.<br> All except the last act.<br> - Alexson suggests a new finish.<br> - Oh, I see, a new finish.<br> How about Saturday night?<br> - Close it?<br> - Close it.<br> Saturday night.<br> - Give the company two weeks' salary.<br> - All right.<br> - Well, good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Hello, dear.<br> - Hello, Mom. Darling.<br> Well, Dad, I was worried about you.<br> Sit down, sweets, right there.<br> You sit down.<br> That theater's awfully cold, George.<br> - Better have more heat put in.<br> - Take care of that.<br> Remember that skating act from Camden?<br> They were there.<br> I wonder where they got the money.<br> Fagan, Feeny and Riley.<br> I remember them well.<br> Well, come on. Tell me.<br> How'd it go?<br> The audience loved it.<br> Every minute of it.<br> The sets were beautiful, George.<br> - Why so quiet, Sam?<br> - The toughest house I've ever seen.<br> The critics walked out<br> at the end of the second act.<br> Come on, Dad. Come on.<br> Let's have it.<br> Well, there's no use<br> beating around the bush.<br> Pretty bad, George.<br> Could've been a lot better.<br> All right, you write a bad play.<br> The only thing to do is forget about it.<br> Everybody's entitled to one failure.<br> Let's go to Delmonico's, have the party.<br> Just as if the show was a hit.<br> You take the girls on over there,<br> and I'll see you in about a half-hour.<br> I got some things<br> I want to talk over with Sam.<br> Those critics have been after me for years.<br> They'll gang up on me and do a good job.<br> But I'll beat them to it. I'll take an ad<br> in every paper alongside their reviews...<br> ...telling the public we got the greatest show<br> in town, sold out for 10 weeks in advance.<br> It'll be my word against theirs.<br> - Georgie, you can't do that.<br> - Why not?<br> You got too big a reputation.<br> Listen, you can't disappoint the public.<br> We stuck our necks out,<br> we got clipped.<br> Georgie.<br> You can't do this.<br> You'll always regret it.<br> - Sit down and take this.<br> - We'll be sorry.<br> - To the theatergoing public.<br> - George...<br> To the theatergoing public.<br> I wrote a play called Popularity.<br> Mr. Harris and I produced that play.<br> In the opinion of people we respect,<br> it is a bad play.<br> In this, we heartily concur.<br> It is a very bad play.<br> I do humbly apologize and ask forgiveness...<br> ...for having presented anything<br> of which you couldn't possibly approve.<br> There will be five more performances.<br> Please miss them.<br> Signed...<br> Happy?<br> It's a wonderful second-act curtain.<br> Send copies of this<br> to all the New York papers.<br> Extra! Lusitania torpedoed<br> by German sub! Extra!<br> This is it, George.<br> And we were worried about<br> the success or failure of a show.<br> Now we've really got<br> something to worry about.<br> Seems it always happens.<br> Whenever we get too high-hat,<br> too sophisticated for flag-waving...<br> ... some thug nation decides we're<br> a pushover, all ready to be blackjacked.<br> And before long we're looking up anxiously<br> to be sure the flag's still waving over us.<br> Left foot.<br> Right foot.<br> On your toes.<br> I used to be a model.<br> You'll look awful pretty peeling potatoes.<br> - On your way, wise guy.<br> - Next.<br> Left foot.<br> Right foot.<br> Take this paper and report<br> to Sgt. Cooper for your examination.<br> Next. Name, please.<br> Oh. George M. Cohan.<br> Occupation:<br> Actor, author, composer and producer.<br> Address:<br> Devonshire Hotel.<br> - How do you know so much about me?<br> - Don't you recognize me, Mr. Cohan?<br> I was a clerk at the Friars Club.<br> - Age: 39.<br> - Doesn't even give me a chance to lie.<br> Thirty-nine? I'm sorry, Mr. Cohan.<br> You're overage. Thirty-one's the limit now.<br> What's 8 or 9 years? The Germans<br> won't ask me for a birth certificate.<br> Oh, I know how you feel, Mr. Cohan.<br> But you've got to be young and tough.<br> It's no picnic. All those hardships,<br> the mental strain...<br> ...trenches,<br> the fighting, the marching.<br> - The ma'am-selles.<br> - I hope.<br> No, you'll never be able to stand it.<br> Hardships and physical strain?<br> You don't know what you're talking about.<br> This war's a coffee klatch compared<br> to a musical show.<br> I'd like to see one of you do what I do in a<br> performance and be on your feet at the end.<br> I'll give you an idea of what I mean.<br> Thank you very much<br> for your entertainment, Mr. Cohan.<br> But I'm afraid we have more need<br> of you here than over there.<br> But that'll make the war last a year longer.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Cohan.<br> - Thank you, major. Thank you.<br> Pick it up, soldier.<br> Keep singing, Nora.<br> - Where are the lights?<br> - I suppose the generator's gone again.<br> Hit your lights and play them on the stage<br> so we can keep going, will you?<br> Boys, hit your lights and keep them on<br> the singer until the others come up, will you?<br> Everybody sing!<br> We'd won the world war.<br> Manhattan went wild with postwar hysteria.<br> But I spiked my shows with prewar stuff.<br> The sentiment and humor an older<br> America had aged in the wood.<br> Still, it was lonely on the main stem.<br> Mother and Josie were gone.<br> Dad was by himself on the farm<br> and had grown very old.<br> Every night I went to the theater,<br> I expected a phone call.<br> Well, finally, it came.<br> You'd better give him two more cc's.<br> May as well try to make him<br> as comfortable as possible.<br> Yes, doctor.<br> If you have to get<br> back to town, Dr. Llewellyn...<br> ...l'll be here all night.<br> - It's all right. I'll wait till George gets here.<br> - Cigarette, doctor?<br> - Yes, I will. Thanks.<br> I remember I was a kid in medical college in<br> Baltimore when I first saw The Four Cohans.<br> They were a great act.<br> Yes, they were.<br> I always thought George M.'s sister<br> was the loveliest dancer I'd ever seen.<br> I can't help thinking<br> a theatrical era is dying in there.<br> His sister and his mother gone<br> and now the old man.<br> In some ways, I think he was<br> the best performer of the lot.<br> Well, I'd settle for his age.<br> There never was anything dull<br> about his life, either.<br> And he's lived to see his son<br> an American institution.<br> I'd settle for that too.<br> - Hello, doc.<br> - Hello, Mr. Cohan.<br> - How is he?<br> - Resting quietly.<br> I think you'd better go in alone.<br> We can't... We can't do that.<br> Wait till George gets here.<br> - Where's George?<br> - Here I am, Dad. Here I am.<br> Oh, that's good.<br> I'm glad you came.<br> The booking office has<br> been calling up all day...<br> ...and they want us to play Des Moines...<br> No, don't worry about that.<br> We're not going to. I've canceled it.<br> We're gonna pick it up on the way back.<br> - How'd it go tonight?<br> - Oh, fine. Fine. Yeah.<br> It's not every kid that gets<br> a chance to play Peck's Bad Boy.<br> That's right.<br> Were you...? Were you nervous?<br> Did you remember your lines?<br> Oh, sure. Every one.<br> I can lick any kid in town.<br> Don't you upstage your mother,<br> or I'll whale the tar out of you.<br> Oh, don't worry, Dad.<br> I'll never do that.<br> I'll play the show<br> with one foot in the trough.<br> No, no. We'll be billed as The Four Cohans.<br> You're not going to break up the act.<br> Don't worry, Dad. They never will.<br> We won't let them. Won't let them.<br> - How many curtain calls did you take?<br> - Six. Six curtains.<br> - That's pretty good for a drama.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Did you make a speech?<br> - I thanked them for us.<br> I said, "My mother thanks you.<br> My father thanks you.<br> My sister thanks you.<br> And I thank you."<br> Well...<br> ...it was a good combination, Sam.<br> Worked well for a long time.<br> Now that it's all over, who was the senior<br> partner and who was the junior partner?<br> You mean who was Dietz<br> and who was Goff?<br> I'll bet it was the first firm in the history of<br> show business to have two senior partners.<br> - You know how I feel, don't you, Sam?<br> - Sure. I understand.<br> When Dad died, with him went<br> the last link with The Four Cohans.<br> All the backslapping and the applause,<br> well, became unimportant. No more fun in it.<br> Didn't mean anything anymore<br> with Dad, Mom and Josie gone.<br> So Mary and I are going away<br> to enjoy ourselves...<br> ...visit all those places<br> we've always wanted to see.<br> Old theaters where nobody<br> ever even heard of us.<br> You'll have to go to Timbuktu.<br> Got it booked.<br> George, you've always been<br> the one with the words.<br> I never was much of a hand at saying things.<br> But we've done more than<br> make a lot of money.<br> And lose a little.<br> Sometimes friends drift apart.<br> Let's not let that happen to us.<br> No matter how legal dissolution<br> of this partnership is, Sam...<br> ...50? of me will<br> always be in this office.<br> I'll remember that when the rent is due.<br> You'll be more successful than ever.<br> But if ever the rent does come due,<br> and you can't meet it, well...<br> And, by the same token, if I get stuck<br> in Madagascar, you'll hear from me.<br> You'd better get out of here.<br> That ship will sail without you.<br> Seasick pills.<br> I won't go to the boat with you.<br> You know how red my nose gets.<br> We thought you guys weren't<br> speaking to each other.<br> Can we have a picture of you<br> tearing up your contract?<br> Well, that's impossible.<br> We never had a written contract.<br> The only contract we've ever had:<br> Hold that pose, will you?<br> We want to show it to our legal department.<br> Life was less full, but it was<br> by no means empty.<br> I still had Mary.<br> A playmate as well as a helpmate.<br> We set out to rubberneck at the world.<br> Nelson Monument. It's a good thing<br> I wasn't born an Englishman.<br> With the history their flag has,<br> I'd have waved myself to death.<br> Oh, George.<br> I didn't know you could yodel.<br> Learned it on the farm.<br> Nothing but hog-calling with frost on it.<br> It takes two men to impersonate<br> a horse on Broadway.<br> And you always have trouble<br> catching the front end.<br> Folks always come back to where their<br> heart is. And we came back to the farm.<br> The farm we Cohans had dreamed of<br> when farmers were envying us.<br> Hey, mister. Our radiator needs some H2o.<br> Can we use your well?<br> Sure, go ahead.<br> Help yourselves.<br> Come on, Jack.<br> - Let's make this hop-up solid.<br> - Okay, Jackson. Come on.<br> - Radiator busted?<br> - No, it's only got high blood pressure.<br> What are you gonna do<br> when the tires give out?<br> Oh, it'll run a lot smoother on the rims.<br> "Stix nix hix pix."<br> - Greek. I'll bet that's Greek talk.<br> - That ain't Greek. That's Russian.<br> - "Stix nix hix pix."<br> - That's show business talk.<br> Here, I'll translate it for you.<br> Stix: Small towns. Nix: Refuse.<br> Hix: Rube. Pix: Pictures.<br> Small towns refuse rube pictures.<br> "Stix nix hix pix."<br> Stix nix hix pix.<br> - I thought that was new jive talk.<br> - New what talk?<br> - Jive talk.<br> - Oh.<br> - Are you an actor, sir?<br> - Used to be.<br> - What were your pictures?<br> - Oh, not in pictures.<br> I was on Broadway,<br> the legitimate theater.<br> - Oh. What's your name, sir?<br> - Cohan.<br> - Coen?<br> - Cohan. George M. Cohan.<br> - I guess you must've been before our time.<br> - Yes, guess I was.<br> - Were you ever in some big shows?<br> - Yeah, a few.<br> - Like what?<br> - Oh, like Little Nellie Kelly...<br> ... The Tavern, Ah, Wilderness!<br> Raised in a vacuum bottle.<br> I guess your parents must have seen me.<br> Fathers and mothers.<br> Maybe they have.<br> I never heard them talk about it.<br> Ever hear of a song called<br> "Give My Regards to Broadway"?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - No, sir. Who sang it?<br> - Who sang it?<br> - Was it a theme song or something?<br> A follow-up to<br> "Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar"?<br> Or "Jeepers Creepers."<br> Come on, kids. Time's a-wasting.<br> We gotta scram now.<br> Swinging session!<br> Thank you very much, Mr...<br> - What was your name again, sir?<br> - Cohan. George Cohan.<br> Goodbye, Georgie.<br> You're cute!<br> - Nice old guy. Let's go!<br> - We've got places to go and things to do.<br> Bye!<br> They did that.<br> I'm not angry,<br> but it's very discouraging.<br> Kid asked me my name, I said, "Cohan."<br> He asked me again, I said, "Cohan."<br> Never even heard of me.<br> But you've been away from<br> the theater for years, George.<br> Nine or ten generations<br> have grown up since then.<br> Naturally they don't remember you.<br> Nobody's got that good a memory.<br> Why not? Many generations remembered my<br> father and mother in vaudeville.<br> That's because they were real troupers.<br> They stayed with it.<br> Your father could do a good buck<br> and wing when he was 60.<br> - What makes you think I can't?<br> - I'd hate to see you try it.<br> Your father never sat around an orchard,<br> listening to his arteries hardening.<br> Nothing wrong with my arteries.<br> No, not right now because<br> those kids got you all worked up.<br> You're picking on me for a reason, Mary.<br> You're trying to get a rise out of me.<br> Come on. Let's have it. What is it?<br> All right. Here it is.<br> I got a long-distance call<br> from Sam Harris this afternoon.<br> What about?<br> He's producing a new show<br> by Kaufman and Hart.<br> They're good writers.<br> Nothing I can do to improve their stuff.<br> Sam thinks you could,<br> if you played the lead.<br> Play the lead?<br> What is the matter with that man?<br> Hasn't he got any sense at all?<br> - What's he trying to do? Spoil all our fun?<br> - But are you having fun, George?<br> When we were in Europe,<br> you haunted every theater...<br> ...not knowing a word<br> that was said on-stage.<br> Going back, congratulating the actors.<br> They didn't know what you were saying.<br> Just to smell the greasepaint again.<br> You think I'm stage-struck. I only go<br> to the theater to get out of the night air.<br> Fun? I'm having a wonderful time.<br> I'll have nothing to do with Broadway.<br> Sam says it's a great part. No other actor<br> in the world but you could do it.<br> That's just more of that Harris con.<br> He needs me as much as<br> he needs a hole in the head.<br> He really does need you, George.<br> He's in trouble.<br> If positions were reversed,<br> he'd help you out. You know he would.<br> Besides, he never said so,<br> but Sam's broke.<br> - Can you think of any more reasons?<br> - Yes. I want you to.<br> Well, that settled it.<br> I've never refused you anything, have I?<br> We'll do it.<br> - Come on. Let's get packing.<br> - We're all packed.<br> - What?<br> - We're all packed, dear.<br> Now you can start getting mad all over again<br> because I told Sam I'd talk you into it.<br> What are you laughing about?<br> Just full of news, aren't you?<br> Telling me all kinds of things.<br> I want you to know<br> I knew it all the time.<br> I was listening in on the phone downstairs<br> while you were talking to Sam.<br> Why, you devil!<br> You knew it all the time!<br> And what's more, I phoned Sam<br> right back and told him I'd play it.<br> Oh, I ought to pop you.<br> You... oh!<br> Good work, kids.<br> I'll see you at 11 in the morning.<br> And then came your wire.<br> And I was really worried.<br> Here I am going on like Tennyson's Brook,<br> giving you my life story.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You should've stopped me.<br> Why, I wanted to hear<br> the story of your life.<br> It has a direct bearing<br> on my sending for you.<br> Do you know what this is?<br> Congressional Medal of Honor.<br> Let's see what the inscription says.<br> "To George M. Cohan.<br> For his contribution to the American spirit.<br> 'Over There' and 'Grand old Flag.'<br> Presented by act of Congress."<br> I congratulate you, Mr. Cohan.<br> I understand you're the first person<br> of your profession to receive this honor.<br> You should be very proud.<br> I am proud.<br> In fact, I'm flabbergasted.<br> For the first time in my life, I'm speechless.<br> - You're sure there isn't some mistake?<br> - Quite sure.<br> But this medal is for people who've given<br> their lives for their country.<br> I'm just a song-and-dance man.<br> Everybody knows that.<br> A man may give his life to his country<br> in many different ways, Mr. Cohan.<br> And quite often, he isn't the best judge<br> of how much he has given.<br> Your songs were a symbol<br> of the American spirit.<br> "Over There" was just as powerful<br> a weapon as any cannon...<br> ...as any battleship we had<br> in the First World War.<br> Today we're all soldiers.<br> We're all on the front.<br> We need more songs to express America.<br> I know you and your comrades<br> will give them to us.<br> Mr. President,<br> I've just begun to earn this medal.<br> It's quite a thing.<br> Well, it's the best material we could find,<br> what with priorities and all.<br> Goodbye, sir.<br> And I want you to know that<br> I'm not the only one that's grateful.<br> My mother thanks you. My father<br> thanks you. My sister thanks you.<br> And I assure you, I thank you.<br> And I wouldn't worry about this country<br> if I were you. We've got this thing licked.<br> Where else in the world could a plain guy<br> like me come in and talk with the head man?<br> Well, that's about as good a definition<br> of America as any I've ever heard.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Cohan, and good luck.<br> - Goodbye, sir. And good luck to you.<br> What's the matter, old timer,<br> don't you remember this song?<br> Seems to me I do.<br> Well, I don't hear anything.<br>
