                        Why do they always put braces on teenage girls<br> at the exact moment when they're most<br> self-conscious about their appearance?<br> I don't know<br> Tom<br> I see him<br> Tom! Jesus!<br> Tom!<br> Hello, Amy<br> Hi, Darryl<br> Amy, would you tell the kids you'll be right back<br> And, shut the door and step outside...<br> talk to us for a minute<br> Okay<br> Be right back, you guys!<br> You're not supposed to go out, Amy<br> She's going to smoke a cigarette<br> Rudy, come on, I'm really late! Come on<br> How was school?<br> Stupid<br> Why do you say that?<br> We're supposed to write a story<br> for English homework. But they didn't tell us<br> what it's supposed to be about<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean, they didn't tell us what it's supposed<br> to be about. They said do whatever you want<br> Well, what's wrong with that?<br> I don't know, I just think it's unstructured<br> Well I'm sure you'll think of something<br> If you can't, I'll help you<br> Okay, here... Don't forget your backpack<br> It's not a backpack, it's a knapsack<br> Then don't forget the knapsack<br> Hey, Give me a hug. Okay<br> Guess who's been asking for you?<br> Oh no, really? Is that his car?<br> Oh yeah<br> Yeah, come in<br> Mister Everett<br> Oh yeah, Brian<br> Brian, hi. I'm Samantha Ann Prescott<br> I'm the lending officer<br> Yeah, hi. Hi. How are you. Have a seat<br> I am so sorry I was late<br> Yeah, we missed you before...<br> I got held up...<br> Believe me, it's nothing I make a habit of<br> I'm sure it's not<br> Actually, would you get that door for me, please<br> So I always run out at 3:15 to meet him...<br> then run real quick over to the sitters house<br> Anyway, Larry never seemed<br> to mind about it, so I was...<br> just hoping you'd feel the same way about it too<br> Well, Samantha, I realize that Scotsville...<br> is not exactly a major banking center<br> No, it's not<br> No, I know it's not<br> But it's kind of a personal challenge to me to see<br> what we can do to bring local service up to<br> the kinds of standards that we'd try to meet<br> if we were the biggest branch in the state<br> Now, that means I don't want anybody<br> running out at 3:15 or 3:30 or whenever<br> the bus happens to come in that day<br> So is there anybody else who can<br> pick up your son after school?<br> Does your husband work in the area?<br> Ahh, no. Rudy Sr. Isn't on the scene<br> so to speak<br> Well, I can give you a few days<br> to make some other arrangements. But...<br> Well, Brian...<br> I understand what you're saying<br> and I think it's great. I do<br> Because there's a lot of things around here<br> that could use some attention. Believe me<br> But I've been meeting this bus<br> every day for 3 years now<br> And it really does, it takes 15 minutes<br> And if I take the time out of my lunch hour...<br> Well, I'd prefer if you would<br> make some other arrangements, Okay?<br> I'll do my best<br> So, how old's your son?<br> He's eight<br> That's a terrific age<br> You got a letter from Uncle Terry<br> What?<br> What room is he going to stay in?<br> He can stay in the little room<br> You know what, he's not going to live here<br> He's only coming here, to stay for a little while<br> And it's okay if you don't remember<br> him because<br> you were only six the last time he was here<br> But I think it'll be nice<br> if you got a chance to know each other<br> Don't you think?<br> Rudy, would it distract you<br> if I put on some music?<br> No<br> Did you think of a story?<br> Uh-huh<br> What's it about?<br> My father<br> What... What about your father?<br> It's just a made-up story about him<br> Can I read it when you're done?<br> It's not very good<br> Don't say that<br> Anyway, Bob, it's kind of this adventure story<br> Rudy's father is a secret agent...<br> or something, working for the government<br> And it made me feel kinda weird. Because<br> I've never said much to him about Rudy Sr<br> Because I don't know what to say<br> And I don't know if I should just let him...<br> imagine what he wants to imagine<br> Of if I should sit him down sometime<br> and you know, tell him...<br> that his father's not such a nice person<br> Well I don't know, Sammy<br> what have you told him already<br> Not much. He knows...<br> He knows I don't have the highest opinion<br> of him<br> He knows I don't want to see him<br> That I don't want to know anything about him<br> Or to have anything to do with him<br> But I've tired to keep it kinda neutral<br> Well anyway, I could go<br> into a lot more detail, believe me<br> It's an interesting problem<br> I don't really know what to tell you<br> It's a little outside my personal field of experti<br> Alright<br> I'd be glad to give it some thought<br> Okay<br> What?<br> No, nothing, I'm just glad to see you<br> I'm glad you called me<br> I bet you were surprised<br> Yeah, a little<br> I should get going<br> Really?<br> Yeah, I've got the babysitter<br> But, thanks for a lovely evening<br> Oh, thank you<br> Hey<br> Hey, Terry<br> Where'd you get that hat?<br> Got it on the street for a dollar<br> It's nice<br> Well it's pretty much your standard woolen hat<br> I had a very similar reaction to it<br> Umm... Umm...<br> Can I get that money from you?<br> Yeah, sorry<br> That all you have?<br> Yeah<br> Can you borrow some more from your brother?<br> That would involve speaking to him<br> Well I'm definitely gonna be gone<br> for a couple of days, Sheila<br> Why do you have to stay for so long?<br> Because my sister's not a bank, okay?<br> I can't just show up...<br> You think my brother's a bank!<br> Can we just cut the puerile crap!<br> I'll be back as soon as I can, okay!<br> I'm not the kind of guy everyone says I am<br> I know you're not<br> Okay, ahh... l'll call you tonight<br> Don't you want to tell me that you love me?<br> I love you<br> That was really convincing<br> Well, after this is over I think you should<br> seriously consider moving back home<br> Yeah<br> Alright<br> So you gonna call me tonight?<br> Definitely<br> Hello? Terry!<br> Whoa... Terry...<br> That's me<br> How's it going?<br> Going good...<br> Give me a hug<br> How you doing, good to see you<br> You too<br> Where you been?<br> Man I've been all over the place<br> Where you headed?<br> Just going up to see Sammy<br> Yeah, yeah. So she said you've been to Alaska?<br> Oh hi, how you going Mr. Parker<br> Good to see you again. Take care<br> So you working?<br> Yeah, yeah<br> Got a postcard every once in a while<br> Yeah, kinda been all over<br> Good to have you back here<br> Thanks, Darryl. You keep enforcing the peace<br> lt'll be a little harder now that you're here<br> but I'll do what I can<br> No man, I'm just visiting<br> Hey, I'll see you around<br> Don't be a stranger, alright<br> Sorry about yesterday<br> I don't care<br> I was studying the bus description<br> And I got on the wrong bus<br> I missed my stop<br> I don't care, Terry. I'm so glad to see you<br> I'm glad to see you too, Sammy<br> So you're coming from work<br> No, it's Saturday<br> Yeah, no, it's just that you dressed so formally<br> Oh, no, you know, I thought I'd...<br> I thought it was special occasion. Which it is<br> No, it's good, it's good<br> I thought I'd get dressed up too<br> It's okay. You look fine<br> Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of garments<br> What?<br> Nothing. Nothing. So how are you?<br> We're fine, Terry<br> So, how's Rudy?<br> We're fine, Terry<br> How are you?<br> Yeah...<br> Where have you been lately, Terry?<br> I know, I haven't been...<br> I got a postcard from you, from Alaska<br> Yeah, yeah I was up there for a little while<br> That was in the fall, Terry<br> Yeah I know, I've been out of touch<br> I was a little worried<br> I've been a lot of different places. I was down<br> in Florida for a little while<br> I was doing some work<br> in Orlando. I've been all over the place<br> Well I just wish<br> you had just let me know you were okay<br> Yeah, I just didn't realize it had been so long<br> You staying in town for a little while<br> Well I don't know<br> I got all these things<br> I got to do back in Worcester<br> Oh<br> Yeah, so I'm probably not gonna<br> be able to stay more than a day or so<br> Oh...<br> I'm kind of trying to keep to a schedule of sorts<br> Oh, that's alright<br> It's a long story and I don't want<br> to trouble you with it right now<br> Are you expecting someone?<br> Who would I be expecting here?<br> You just keep looking around, that's all<br> No, I was just wondering if we could<br> get some more refreshments, that's all<br> I actually got to confess to you, Sammy<br> That's the reason<br> you may not have heard from me for while<br> is I've been unable to write on the account<br> of that<br> I was in jail for a little while<br> You were what?<br> I sort of did a little time, I guess<br> down in Florida, it was just bullshit<br> What?<br> It was bullshit!<br> What did you do?<br> I didn't do anything! Maybe I was wronged?<br> No! Could I please... Oh my god!<br> Please let me tell you what happened<br> What happened?<br> I got into a fight in a bar in Florida<br> I was not the one who started it<br> But they worked up all this bullshit against me...<br> and they threw me in the pen for 3 months<br> I didn't write you because...<br> I didn't want you to get all upset about it<br> I thought, you would figure that<br> I was on the road for a while<br> It was stupid, I'm sorry<br> I didn't mean to make you worry<br> But you know what. I can't run around<br> doing stuff for not doing stuff<br> because it'll make you worry<br> Because I come back here<br> and tell you my fuckin' traumas<br> and I get this wounded<br> I've let you down, bullshit. Over and over again<br> It just cramps me<br> I just wanna get out from under it<br> And now I'm back in this fucking hole<br> explaining myself to you again!<br> Please stop cursing at me<br> I mean, I realize I'm in no position<br> to basically say anything<br> but it's not like I'm down there<br> in some redneck bar in Florida<br> having an argument with some stripper's<br> boyfriend<br> and I suddenly say to myself, hey<br> this would be<br> a good time to really stick it to Sammy<br> and get myself locked up for a few months<br> You don't write me for 6 months<br> I don't know where you are<br> I don't know if you're alive or dead<br> Then you show up out of nowhere<br> and you tell me you were in jail!<br> I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Sammy<br> I'm really sorry<br> Sammy...<br> What?<br> I'm in the midst of a slight predicament<br> What do you need, money?<br> Um, yeah. I'm broke<br> I gotta get back to Worcester tomorrow<br> I got this girl there<br> and she's kind of in a bad situation<br> So... I just need to borrow some money<br> Whatever you can spare<br> I'll pay you back, man<br> I'll pay you back<br> I just...<br> I really wish mom was here<br> So do I, man<br> No one knows what to do with you<br> I know how they feel, man<br> Terry, can I ask you a question?<br> Sure<br> I mean, do you ever go to church anymore?<br> Sammy can we not talk about that shit?<br> Do you?<br> No, Sammy. I don't<br> Can you tell me why not?<br> Yeah, because I think it's ridiculous<br> Well, can you tell me without denigrating it?<br> It's primitive, okay, it's a fairy tale<br> Well have you ever considered maybe that's<br> what's making things so difficult for you?<br> No<br> That you've lost hold...<br> not just your religious feeling<br> but lost hold of any kind of anchor<br> Any kind of trust in anything<br> No wonder you drift around so much<br> I mean...<br> what's to stop you. How would you ever know<br> if you ever found the right thing<br> I'm not looking for anything, man<br> I'm just trying to get on with it<br> Here we go<br> Thank you<br> Thanks, Sammy<br> I'm really going to pay you back<br> Where we going?<br> Pick up Rudy<br> Well, do you even want me to visit now?<br> Because I can catch the bus at five o'clock<br> if that's what you want<br> Of course I want you to visit, you idiot!<br> I've been looking forward<br> to seeing you more than anything<br> I've told everybody I know that<br> you were coming home<br> I cleaned the whole fucking house<br> so it would look nice for you<br> I thought you'd stay at least a few days...<br> I had no idea that you were just broke again!<br> I just wish you'd send me an invoice!<br> Hi, is that, is that Malcom? Hi...<br> this is Terry Prescott<br> I've been trying to get a hold of Sheila...<br> and the phone isn't picking up<br> And I was wondering if...<br> She what?<br> Well is she alright?<br> Can I talk to her, please?<br> Okay, could you please give her a message<br> And tell that I...<br> That girl I'm with tried to kill herself<br> What?<br> She tired to kill herself<br> You have everything you need?<br> I think so<br> What are you going to do?<br> I don't know. Send her the money I guess<br> Maybe you should stay home for a while<br> Yeah, maybe a good idea<br> This 15 year old says<br> she's sick of her brother trying to control her<br> Dropped out of school, she's doing drugs<br> says there's nothing he can do about it<br> I'm going to bed<br> You have everything you need?<br> Ahh, yeah, thanks<br> Goodnight<br> Goodnight<br> Terry, I'm really glad you're home<br> Yeah me too, Sammy<br> So we'll drop Rudy off at the bus, then all<br> you have to do is drop me off at the bank...<br> and then pick Rudy up at 3:30<br> and drive him over to Carol's house<br> And that's it, she lives on Harvey Lane<br> Okay<br> Rudy knows where she lives<br> Okay<br> God, Mabel, don't those colors hurt your eyes?<br> Oh no, keeps me fresh<br> Yeah?<br> Hi Sammy, what can I do for ya'?<br> Umm, Brian, did you want us<br> to hand these time sheets...<br> in at the end of the day or<br> at the end of the week?<br> Oh, yeah. The end of the day will be fine<br> Just seems like an awful lot of extra paperwork<br> I like paperwork<br> You showed up<br> Looks that way<br> Put on your seatbelt<br> It pushes on my neck<br> What?<br> It pushes on my neck, it's uncomfortable<br> Well, when somebody slams into us<br> and you go sailin' through the windshield<br> that's liable to be uncomfortable too<br> Now put on your seatbelt<br> Mom's parents died in a car accident<br> Yeah, I know. They were my parents too<br> They are?<br> Yeah, your mom's my sister<br> Yeah, I know<br> So that means we have the same parents<br> Oh yeah<br> Oh yeah<br> Umm, Carol just called<br> She said Terry and Rudy<br> never showed up at her house<br> You've got to be kidding<br> It's supposed to filed by number<br> the account number, not alphabetically<br> Sammy? Sammy!<br> Hey. Look, if you hold it further down, you're<br> gonna get a lot more power<br> You should be able<br> to hit that nail in with two or three hits. Look<br> See? Go ahead, try it<br> That's not the way I hold it<br> Well they way you hold it, is wrong<br> Why can't I just hold it my own way<br> You can...<br> Alright, good, that's good<br> Sammy, please see me, ASAP!!! Brian<br> Brian, did you want to see me?<br> Yeah, I was kinda wondering<br> what happened to you today<br> Didn't Mabel tell you<br> I had a false alarm about my son<br> Yeah well I kind of thought<br> you were gonna work that out?<br> I did work it out. More or less<br> Then what are you doing<br> leaving here in the middle of the day<br> Without so much<br> as a word of explanation to me, Sammy<br> Brian, don't yell at me...<br> I'm not yelling at you<br> I'm just... getting a little frustrated here<br> Well...<br> Sorry, would you close the door, please<br> And Eddie Dwyer lives in Buffalo, with his wife<br> and two kids, if you can believe it<br> That's depressing<br> Why?<br> I just never expected him the marrying type<br> Who are you talking about?<br> Some wild kids we use to know<br> Were you a wild kid?<br> Not as wild as your mom<br> Yeah, right<br> You don't believe me? No<br> Ask her<br> Mom, were you?<br> No comment<br> What are you doing?<br> Oh... Just reading some of your compositions<br> Why are you smoking?<br> Uhh, because it's bad. Don't ever do it<br> I won't<br> You know this used to be my room?<br> Yeah<br> Do you want it back?<br> No<br> Did you fight in Vietnam?<br> No. I wasn't even born yet<br> Were you ever in the Army?<br> No<br> My father was in the Army<br> I know<br> Unfortunately he didn't fight in Vietnam either<br> Were you friends with him?<br> Not really, I mean<br> we had some friends in common I guess...<br> I didn't like him very much<br> Why not?<br> Well... He wasn't very likeable<br> Why do you say that?<br> I don't know<br> he was always better than you at everything<br> Like if you were all playing basketball or<br> something, everybody's have like a friendly game<br> he was ready to kill somebody<br> if his team didn't win<br> Or if you told a joke or a story<br> he always had to tell a better one<br> Kinda gets annoying after awhile<br> Plus it was pretty scummy<br> how he split on you and your mom<br> He was a prick. Probably still a prick<br> Fortunately for you though<br> your mom is like the greatest<br> So you had some bad luck<br> and some good luck<br> You mind if I ask you a personal question?<br> I don't know<br> Do you like it here? I mean, in Scotsville<br> Yeah<br> Why?<br> I don't know...<br> My friends are here, I like the scenery<br> I don't know<br> I know... lt's so... There's nothing to do here<br> Yes there is<br> No there isn't man, it's narrow. It's dull<br> It's a dull<br> narrow town full of dull narrow people<br> who don't know anything except<br> what things are like right around here<br> They have no perspective whatsoever<br> No scope<br> They might as well be living in the<br> because they have no idea of<br> what's going on...<br> and if you try to tell 'em that<br> they wanna fuckin' kill you<br> What are you talking about?<br> I have no idea<br> you're a good kid<br> Sammy, please see me... Brian<br> Yeah, this doesn't apply to you<br> Sammy, but...<br> I've noticed that some of the employees<br> are setting their PC monitors...<br> to all kinds of crazy colors<br> Purple, polks dots...<br> what have you<br> And it's no big deal, but really...<br> this is a bank. You know?<br> It's really not appropriate<br> So I'm just asking that<br> people use the more quote unquote...<br> normal range of colors in the future<br> Like I said, this doesn't really apply to you<br> No. My computer palette's pretty conservative<br> Bob Steegerson<br> What are you wearing?<br> Mom?<br> What's up?<br> Do you know you have an enormous leak<br> coming from the upstairs hallway?<br> Yeah, I did<br> You guys sure you're going to be okay?<br> Yes. Yes<br> What is happening here?<br> It's just the problem is, the pipe is corroded<br> the whole length of the hall<br> So every time I put in a new piece<br> it starts leaking further down<br> Why don't I just call the plumber?<br> Why? He's not gonna do anything<br> different than what I'm doing<br> Yeah, we're making it worse<br> No we're not. Shut up...<br> Thanks. Thank you<br> So call if there's any problems<br> and if I'm not there. I'm either<br> on my way back home or on my way<br> Okay<br> Nice to meet you, Bob<br> You too<br> So lights out at ten<br> and don't spend the whole night watching TV<br> What's your idea of the whole night?<br> This kid is a sure bet to lead the way<br> for the next generation of California Surfers<br> What's your feeling about Bob?<br> I don't really know him that well<br> I have bad news for you<br> No...<br> Great. What are we supposed to do now?<br> Do you know how to play pool?<br> I've played it<br> I don't think they let kids in here. What?<br> I don't think they let kids in here<br> Well, we're not allowed to watch any more TV<br> so it's this or nothing<br> But if we get into trouble<br> let me do the talking. Okay?<br> Okay<br> I got a hundred bucks here says<br> me and my nephew can beat anybody in here<br> Only we gotta get the next game<br> because he's gotta be in bed by 10 o'clock<br> Just hit it nice and soft, nice and soft<br> One, two, three<br> Sorry<br> God damn it, Rudy<br> I thought you said you could play<br> Boys, it's all over but the cryin'<br> Bob, are you serious?<br> Yeah<br> I don't know what to say...<br> Look... I mean... I know that umm...<br> I haven't been the most...<br> decisive guy in the past<br> But, I don't know. I am tired of fooling around<br> And I love you<br> I... l'm totally... I don't know what to say<br> You could say yes...<br> or you could think about it some more<br> Would you like to think about it?<br> I want to think about it<br> Okay. Alright, fair enough<br> It's all yours, baby<br> Just make sure to hit it really gentle. But firm<br> And hit it a little low so you get some back spin<br> Okay. Don't even hit it, just kiss it<br> What do you mean, kiss it?<br> I mean tap it<br> Firm but very, very softly<br> And don't take the shot until you know<br> you're going to make it. Okay?<br> Okay<br> Let's go! Go! Go! Go...<br> What is going on here?<br> We were out doing some stargazing<br> and Rudy lost track of time<br> I totally warned him about it<br> You are a bad kid...<br> Hey, I think it's okay<br> just don't tell her where we went<br> Because she'll be really mad at me. Okay?<br> I won't<br> Hey, I mean it, Rudy, I'm not kidding<br> I won't<br> Did you know mom used to take me and Uncle<br> Terry out at night to look at the constellations?<br> Yeah<br> Did you see that one, what's the one...<br> It looks like a big W...<br> Cassiopeia<br> Yeah<br> Oww! Shit!<br> I've got a great idea...<br> What's that?<br> Why don't I call the plumber<br> Do whatever you want<br> Oh, what? What? That makes you mad?<br> No<br> Sorry<br> Brian, get off my ass<br> Excuse me?<br> I did not change the colors<br> on your stupid computer screen<br> Well then that's all you got to say!<br> There's nothing wrong with the work I do here<br> I didn't say there was<br> I've been doing fine the whole time<br> before you got here<br> And if you think that riding people in this pretty<br> ridiculous way is the way to improve service...<br> in this bank or anywhere else<br> you're out of your mind<br> May I respond?<br> No, that's all I really have to...<br> May I respond?<br> First of all, I would appreciate it<br> if you would not speak to me that way<br> I don't talk to you that way<br> and I would appreciate it...<br> if you did not talk to me that way<br> And second of all<br> if you tell me that you did not change my screen...<br> then of course I accept your answer<br> But you and I are going to have to<br> work together<br> And it's not going to happen with the attitude<br> with the lateness...<br> I do not have an attitude<br> You're fighting me every step of the way!<br> Okay, not you, you're not late<br> Well then don't say I'm late, if I'm not late<br> I would like to finish<br> Okay, you're all set<br> Dave, this is my wife, Nancy<br> Mabel, this is my wife, Nancy. Mabel...<br> Hi Nice to meet you<br> And Chuck...<br> Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you<br> This is Sammy, our lending officer<br> Sammy this is my wife, Nancy<br> Hi, it's nice to meet you<br> Brian, I gotta sit down<br> Yeah. Sure, let's go in my office<br> I'm fine!<br> Brian? Yeah?<br> Mom<br> Rudy!<br> Look, I am really glad<br> you guys are getting along so well<br> like you have no idea but<br> if I can't rely on you...<br> to remember to get him once a day...<br> You can!<br> You took him to play pool<br> in the middle of the night...<br> and then telling him to lie to me about it!<br> I don't know<br> Get out of the car<br> What are we doing?<br> You're going to Carol's and I'm going home<br> Why can't I come with you<br> Because if you're such a baby<br> that you gotta tell your mommy...<br> about us playin' pool when I asked you not to<br> And I gotta listen to her shit all day...<br> then you're going to the babysitter's<br> so you can stay at the baby house<br> But I didn't...<br> You know what? Don't even fuckin' talk to me<br> I didn't!<br> Get out<br> You're working late<br> How did your wife like the bank?<br> Oh fine. She wasn't feeling so great<br> That's too bad<br> Oh no, I don't mean... She's not ill<br> She's just... I don't know<br> Pregnant<br> Yeah, that's right. She's pregnant<br> Well it can make you kind of cranky<br> Yeah<br> Look, I'm sorry we've been<br> stepping on each other's toes<br> Yeah, so am I<br> I'm really not that bad of a guy<br> I know you're not, Brian<br> But you're driving everybody crazy<br> Well, I'm trying to do my best here...<br> and I'm getting it from all sides<br> I know you are<br> Anyway, we'll work it out<br> Well, I could use a beer<br> I could use a tranquilizer<br> Last I heard, Rudy's Dad was living over<br> in Auburn. But that was a year ago<br> Must be so tough trying to raise a kid<br> on your own<br> I'm not sure but I think my wife<br> It's just hormones<br> Well, no, it isn't. But never mind<br> Thanks. Thank you...<br> Well, here's to improved<br> employee-management relations<br> Amen<br> You know you can't judge all of Scotsville<br> by the people in that bank, believe me<br> Well umm, let's... let's not talk about the bank<br> Okay<br> Let's just forget about the bank for tonight<br> Good idea<br> Sammy? Sammy!<br> Yeah?<br> I want you to tell me who changed<br> the colors on my computer screen<br> I'll never tell<br> Bob called<br> Where were you?<br> Nowhere, I had dinner with my boss<br> Kind of a late dinner, isn't it?<br> Yeah<br> How was Rudy?<br> Fine, he's asleep<br> Did the plumber come?<br> Yeah the fucking plumber came, geez...<br> Terry, just give me a break<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Nothing! I'm just tired<br> Want to smoke some pot?<br> No, I don't. Why, you got some?<br> So... Bob asked me to marry him<br> What are you going to do?<br> I don't know<br> if he'd asked me this same time last year...<br> I probably would have said yes<br> But the minute he asked me...<br> it was like someone was trying to strangle me<br> Whoa, bad sign<br> Yeah, I know. Plus, Terry, I fucked my boss...<br> What?<br> I know, and his wife is six months pregnant<br> Jesus Christ, Sammy<br> I know. I know<br> I'm sorry I got so ma at you before<br> I just don't want him...<br> you know, terrified of telling...<br> Well, that's not real his problem, Sammy<br> Oh? What do you think his problem is?<br> I think his problem is, he's totally sheltered...<br> you treat the kid like's three, instead of eight<br> So that's how he behaves<br> And how do you think he should behave?<br> I think he shouldn't have to run and<br> tell mommy...<br> every time he does something<br> she might not approve of, for one thing<br> Uh-huh<br> I mean, I took him to play pool<br> It was a little clandestine thing we did for fun<br> It wasn't a big secret, I mean, you care<br> I was actually trying to be nice to him<br> but he's so freaked out...<br> that he disobeyed your orders<br> that he has to fuckin' squeal on me...<br> and then I got to listen to your shit all-day<br> And I didn't fucking do anything<br> Okay, first of all, he didn't say anything<br> Darryl did. Okay?<br> Second, I don't give a shit<br> if you took him out to play pool<br> I was mad 'cause you left him<br> at the bus stop in the rain<br> No, I don't want you telling him not to squeal<br> Because I don't want him put in that position<br> Well that, is a perfect example<br> of what I'm talking about<br> You are an idiot<br> So what are you saying? Darryl told you?<br> Yes!<br> Sammy, please see me<br> Good morning<br> Yeah, good morning<br> Could you shut the door please<br> Brian, I just wanted to...<br> Brian...<br> You're awfully quiet<br> I'm sorry<br> So have you thought at all about what I said?<br> Sure, I've been thinking about it<br> So, any decisions, or...<br> Do you want to think about it some more?<br> Well I mean, I don't know, Bob<br> It's not like we've been going steady for<br> the last few months. You know what I mean?<br> Yeah, no... I know...<br> And then we see each other twice<br> and you suddenly say you want to get married?<br> No, you know, you're right<br> So what are you tallking about<br> I don't know... I umm...<br> Last year, I thought that maybe you were<br> possibly<br> interested in that idea but I was the one...<br> who was ready at that point<br> So that's why I thought things slow down<br> with us<br> Don't make me feel bad for you<br> I don't want you to feel bad for me<br> It's Brian<br> Brian, where are you?<br> I'm buying milk, I just thought I'd say hello<br> Look, I know it's probably too late, but is there<br> any way you can come out for a little while?<br> Brian, I think you're going crazy<br> I know I am. Can you meet me?<br> Umm, okay<br> Umm, I have to go out for a little while<br> do you want anything?<br> Like what?<br> I don't know<br> Where are you going?<br> Yeah, where you going?<br> I have to go out for a little while<br> Where? Yeah, where?<br> I'm going to Mabel's house<br> Why?<br> You know what, Rudy? It's personal<br> It's a personal matter<br> That has to do with Mabel<br> And I just have to go<br> see her for a little while<br> Listen. Listen<br> I'm sorry I said you squealed on me<br> I was totally out of line...<br> and I really owe you an apology<br> Did you hear me?<br> I don't care<br> What's on your mind, Sammy?<br> Well, a lot. But principally...<br> I was just wondering if you had an opinion<br> If you know someone, in your family<br> or even just someone you really care about...<br> and they just can't quite get a hold of<br> themselves<br> So, guess who these are for?<br> Me!<br> That's right, my little friend<br> Hello, we're going fishing<br> I got a new rod and reel, five lures...<br> a hat, a knife and a fish scalier<br> That's great, sweetie<br> I'll get it<br> Well, I'm not really sure why you're here, Ron<br> I know I haven't been the model citizen<br> since I got here<br> But considering how things have been<br> going for me lately...<br> I thought I was doing pretty well<br> And I also find it kind of discouraging<br> that you seem to think that I'm...<br> in need of some kind of spiritual guidance<br> or what have you. So much so<br> that you're willing to disregard the fact that<br> I don't believe in any of this stuff at all<br> Well I didn't mean to discourage you<br> I mean it's really kind of insulting<br> Can I say something here?<br> Sammy asked me to come and talk to you<br> because it's her opinion that<br> you're not gonna find what you're looking for<br> the way you're looking for it<br> How would she know?<br> I'm really not here to try to get you to do<br> anything, or to get you to believe anything<br> And I'll tell you the same thing I told her<br> Which is, as far as I'm concerned<br> the only way she can help you...<br> is by her example<br> By trying to be a model for you<br> In the way she lives her life<br> And that doesn't mean she's supposed to be<br> a saint, either if that's what you're smiling abou<br> I didn't realize I was smiling<br> You know, Terry, a lot of people come to<br> see me with all kinds of problems<br> Drugs, alcohol, marital problems<br> sexual problems<br> Good job you have, man<br> Well... I like it<br> Because even in this little town, I really feel li<br> what I do is very connected with<br> the real center of people's lives<br> I'm not saying I'm always Mr Effective...<br> but I don't feel like my life is off<br> to the side of what's important<br> I don't feel that my happiness and comfort<br> are based on closing my eyes to trouble...<br> within myself or trouble in other people<br> I don't feel like a negligible little scrap...<br> floating around in some kind of empty void<br> With no sense of connected-ness to anything...<br> around me except by virtue of whatever little<br> philosophies I can scrape together on my own<br> Well...<br> Can I ask you, Terry... do you think<br> your life is important?<br> You mean, like, me personally?<br> My individual life?<br> Yeah<br> I'm not really sure, what do you mean?<br> It's important to me, I guess<br> And like, to my... you know<br> the people who care about me<br> But do you think it's important?<br> I...<br> Do you think it's important in the scheme<br> of things?<br> Not just because it's yours<br> or because you're somebody's brother<br> Because I really don't get<br> the impression that you do<br> Well I particularly don't think anybody's life<br> has any particular importance besides whatever<br> you know, like whatever we arbitrarily give it<br> Which is fine. I mean, you know<br> we might as well<br> I think my life is as important as anybody else<br> I don't know... A lot of what you're saying<br> has real appeal to me<br> A lot of the stuff they told us when we<br> were kids<br> But I don't want to believe or not believe<br> in something because I might feel bad<br> I want to believe in it and not believe in it<br> because I think it's true or not<br> Yeha, I want to think my life is important<br> That it's connected to something important<br> Well isn't there any way for you to believe<br> that without calling it God or<br> religion or whatever term it is that you<br> object to?<br> Yeah, I believe that<br> So Sammy, what example<br> are you setting for us tonight?<br> What time are we getting up to go fishing?<br> We're not going fishing<br> What do you mean?<br> Why not?<br> I think you should go fishing with Father Ron<br> I don't want to go fishing with Father Ron<br> Well, I'm not gonna take you<br> I'll take you sweetie<br> I realize that you're mad at me...<br> I'm not mad at you<br> but he didn't do anything to you<br> And you cannot promise a little boy<br> that you're gonna...<br> I just, you know, after all that<br> religions conversation, I realize...<br> it's probably not so good for him to be<br> spending so much time with someone...<br> who doesn't believe that his life is important<br> in the scheme of things<br> Would you please...<br> I'm serious<br> Listen. I am sure if you put your mind to it...<br> you can think of some other way<br> of getting back at me besides this<br> So would you please just give it some thought<br> and take him fishing tomorrow?<br> I would, Sammy, but I really don't think<br> it's good for him<br> You suck<br> You know my wife, Nancy<br> Yes, hello<br> Nice to see you<br> Father, nice sermon<br> Anyway, I don't know what the churches...<br> specific position is on fornication<br> and adultery these days<br> But I felt really hypocritical not saying<br> anything to you about it before, so...<br> what is the official position these days?<br> Well... lt's a sin<br> Good. I think it should be<br> But we try not to focus on that aspect<br> of it, too much, right off the bat<br> Why not?<br> Well I think you should<br> Maybe it was better when you came in here<br> and they screamed at you for having sex<br> with your married boss<br> They told you what a terrible thing it was<br> They were really mean to you<br> Maybe it'd be better if you told me<br> I was endangering my immortal soul<br> And that if I don't quit...<br> I'm going to burn in hell<br> Don't you ever think that?<br> Umm... no<br> Well it would be a lot better than all this...<br> why do you think you're in this situation...<br> psychological bullshit you hear all the time<br> Well, why do you think you're in this situation?<br> With which one?<br> All of them?<br> I feel sorry for them<br> Isn't that ridiculous?<br> I've never been so bored in my whole life<br> We should have been here around 7 or 8 AM<br> What time is it now?<br> Was my father a good fisherman?<br> Yeah, he was good at all that stuff<br> He knew every<br> thing about the woods<br> everything about hunting<br> everything about fishing, everything about cars<br> If he wasn't such a pain in the ass<br> he would've been a lot of fun to be around<br> Maybe he's nice now?<br> I doubt it<br> Well, I think he is<br> How would you know?<br> Did you ever meet him?<br> No<br> Were you ever curious about meeting him?<br> I guess so<br> He lives near here<br> I thought he lived in Alaska<br> No... I lived in Alaska<br> He lives in Auburn, as far as I know<br> We could look him up in the phone book<br> Wanna try it?<br> Alright<br> But, Rudy...<br> I'm sure I don't have to tell you this<br> But I'm not kidding, man<br> Don't tell your mother<br> Can I get you something?<br> Hey, you want to go for a walk? Or a drive<br> it's really nice out<br> No, I'm not going to stay long<br> Bob, I don't wanna get married<br> Okay<br> I've been thinking about it fo a while...<br> and if you had asked me last year<br> I'm sure I would have said yes<br> Oh, thank you<br> But I'm not sure it would have been<br> an good idea then either<br> I've been going through a really hard time lately<br> I think that getting engaged to you or<br> anybody else<br> would probably be the stupidest<br> most self destructive thing I could possibly do<br> Okay<br> And I really think you need to grow up<br> Well how about we fix<br> my personality some other time?<br> Okay<br> I really hope we can still be friends<br> Oh yes, me too...<br> Bob...<br> Bob... l...<br> I don't know... Sammy, I love you, I really...<br> I love you<br> I love you too<br> Oh shit, I got to go! I'm sorry<br> What? Where do you have to go?<br> I have to get Mabel her car<br> Now?<br> I don't understand, how are we leaving things?<br> I don't know. Call me later<br> This is incredible<br> That is not what I mean<br> Maybe we should call first?<br> Well we're right here<br> Come on<br> There he is<br> His last name is Kolinsky?<br> Yeah<br> Go ahead, knock<br> Yes?<br> Hi, we're looking for Rudy<br> Who should I say is calling?<br> An old friend<br> Who is it!<br> He says, an old friend!<br> How old is he?<br> Hey!<br> Hey, Rudy<br> Hey<br> Hi, I'm Terry<br> Hello<br> This is Rudy<br> You don't say<br> Rudy, meet Rudy<br> I'll just be in the kitchen<br> Nice meeting you<br> Okay if we come in for a minute?<br> What the hell are you doing?<br> What do you mean, what am I doing?<br> Could you back away from the door please?<br> We just wanna come in...<br> Back away from the door please?<br> What are you doing here?<br> Just wanted the kid to see you, man<br> Well now he saw me<br> Now you saw me, alright?<br> Now, do you mind?<br> Man you are really...<br> I'm trying to be polite, alright<br> So just take off, okay, just take off<br> I just wanna...<br> Do you know what you're doing here?<br> Just get out of here, alright<br> You know what, man<br> you're still a fucking asshole<br> I'm an asshole?
