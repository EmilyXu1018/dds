                        One can prevent mildew<br> by spraying with copper sulfate.<br> There are 2 classic solutions used,<br> one from Bordeaux,<br> the other from Burgundy.<br> Burgundy being a region in France<br> which is reputed for its wine.<br> Three sprayings a year are required.<br> The first when the shoots reach<br> two or three centimetres long,<br> the second just before or after<br> the flowering,<br> and the third a month later.<br> The treatment is preventative<br> and must not be neglected.<br> Gentlemen, I'll finish my speech<br> on mildew prevention.<br> I remind you<br> that as in previous years,<br> airplanes and flyers will be placed<br> at your disposal<br> to remind the farmers that mildew,<br> a disease that destroys vines,<br> appeared simultaneously<br> with that other ideological disease<br> which has devastated men.<br> But the Chief of Police<br> will develop this point.<br> Any similarity to actual persons<br> or events is deliberate<br> As the Under-secretary<br> of Agriculture said,<br> An ideological illness<br> is like mildew<br> and requires preventive measures.<br> Like mildew,<br> it is due<br> to septic germs<br> and various parasitic agents.<br> So the treatment of men<br> with appropriate solutions<br> is indispensable.<br> The 1st stage occurs<br> in the schools<br> where,<br> if you'll pardon the metaphor,<br> the sprouts are still very young.<br> The 2nd treatment<br> occurs when they begin to bloom<br> as college students<br> or young workers.<br> The draft is the best time<br> to spray and save the sacred<br> tree of national liberty<br> from the disease<br> of ideological mildew.<br> Air-dropped leaflets are telling<br> our peasants of a new kind<br> of ideological mildew<br> beginning to ravage our land.<br> This new variety<br> is spreading insidiously.<br> It's a sly enemy<br> pushing us away<br> from God and the Crown.<br> It's against this enemy<br> that our action is aimed.<br> Don't take notes!<br> It's all in our pamphlet.<br> With the outbreak of isms,<br> like socialism, anarchism,<br> imperialism or communism,<br> sunspots start to multiply<br> on the face of the golden orb.<br> God refuses to enlighten the Reds!<br> Scientists forecast<br> an increase in sunspots<br> due to the arrival of the beatniks<br> and pacifists from certain countries<br> such as ltaly,<br> France and Scandinavia!<br> As head of Law and Order<br> here in the north,<br> I wish to tell you,<br> who are high civil servants,<br> we must preserve<br> the healthy elements<br> of our society<br> and heal those that are ill.<br> Tonight the enemy's holding<br> a meeting on our city.<br> But we are not an ism!<br> We are a democracy!<br> We won't forbid the meeting.<br> Nor will we forbid<br> the opposition from demonstrating!<br> With these healthy anti-bodies,<br> we must fight all diseases<br> of both the vine<br> as well as Society!<br> That's all I have to say.<br> Bear it in mind<br> during the days to come!<br> - Having lunch?<br> - Rapidly!<br> I'll take you to your plane.<br> - Thank you!<br> - It's my pleasure!<br> Tell my wife<br> I'll pick her up this evening.<br> An excursion<br> for the Bolsho ballerinas!<br> From Moscow?<br> The Bolsho Ballet is here<br> for 4 days. They open tonight.<br> - Stay over! You can sit in my box.<br> - I must return to the capital.<br> Ah, the capital! The palace!<br> The Palace thinks well of you!<br> What if one of them<br> chose freedom here?<br> Like that famous dancer...<br> No, none of that!<br> For freedom they pick London<br> or the US where the money's stable!<br> We have enough hot-heads in town!<br> Enough problems!<br> Stop! Take that down!<br> No permit's needed<br> for a meeting indoors!<br> I don't want any trouble!<br> Get a permit to use the hall!<br> Do as I say!<br> Bring me your permit!<br> Or meet elsewhere!<br> Take it down!<br> How can we find<br> another hall now<br> and tell 3 or 4 thousand people<br> about it?<br> - It's a rally!<br> - You signed the receipt!<br> Now it's unsigned! Here's your check!<br> I'll pay you compensation!<br> You got threats!<br> I don't know what you mean!<br> You don't cancel a rental<br> unless you're pressured!<br> - You lawyers are...<br> - Bozini, you're an honest man.<br> Who's behind all this? Why?<br> I don't want you in my hall,<br> that's why!<br> If you don't like it, lump it!<br> There must be a reason!<br> My father died today! OK?<br> I'd gladly let you see it<br> but the city inspector came by.<br> When?<br> Yesterday.<br> The seats must be specially set.<br> We can set 'em up this afternoon.<br> No, fastened to the floor!<br> It'll take a week at least.<br> Since when!<br> We cancel or meet in the street!<br> And without a permit!<br> That'd mean instigators and cops!<br> We won't find a hall.<br> They'll all refuse!<br> I say we have to cancel it.<br> He'd never agree!<br> We cancel it<br> and go quietly off to bed<br> or better yet,<br> to the Bolsho opening!<br> And we take him there too?<br> And send his audience there?<br> - You got a hall?<br> - The Bolsho!<br> A plot on the doc's life!<br> - Says who?<br> - My wife.<br> Who told you? None of my business?<br> What'll we tell the police?<br> Don't hang up!<br> She won't say. The guy didn't know<br> the doctor's due today.<br> This is George Pirou.<br> You must tell us who...<br> Certainly not!<br> I trust him. He didn't know<br> about tonight's meeting.<br> He overheard a discussion.<br> He won't tell you. Me neither!<br> He's had enough trouble!<br> He has a family!<br> Now they know!<br> Now you know. So do something!<br> It's for you.<br> I know, darling. See you later!<br> What do we do?<br> Call the Red Cross!<br> Attorney-Gen.!<br> It's all quite vague.<br> An anonymous witness.<br> An overheard conversation!<br> Maybe it's a hoax or a chronic liar!<br> Like those who<br> phone there's a bomb in a plane...<br> Who'd want to kill your president?<br> Marie, open the door!<br> Shall we go?<br> I'll call the Head of Security.<br> He'll provide protection,<br> unofficially!<br> We've no basis for any action!<br> Yes, I'm interested<br> in the Paris Commune!<br> - I'm late!<br> - You'll come to the theatre tonight?<br> As for a hall, I can do nothing.<br> The colonel!<br> Property rights<br> can't be infringed upon,<br> even though<br> some may want to change that!<br> - Yes, Papa?<br> - Niki, see to our guest.<br> In 2 seconds!<br> He's a fine magistrate!<br> He's out? Give me his duty officer.<br> You know about tonight?<br> Not the Bolsho!<br> Yes! The Doctor's life<br> has been threatened.<br> - No, but he's due to arrive...<br> - Shortly.<br> He'll arrive shortly.<br> No... on the phone.<br> Like you say...<br> Tell the Col. I phoned.<br> "All quite vague"...<br> "No basis for any action".<br> The Doctor'll be mad when he hears<br> we asked those puppets for help.<br> - Puppets?<br> - Of the USA!<br> What can they have to do with it!<br> Always blame the USA!<br> Even if you're wrong!<br> Cut it out! You're not always funny!<br> There they are!<br> The police?<br> They've tailed me for 3 days.<br> Everything's set?<br> No. We lost our hall<br> and no one knows it!<br> They want to sabotage the meeting.<br> Who can fix it?<br> Only the Head of Security.<br> We'll see him after lunch.<br> Let's go now!<br> Then, to the hotel.<br> Your life's been threatened.<br> A guy overheard some talk about it.<br> - We'll ask the cops...<br> - For nothing!<br> Just for a hall, that's all!<br> This hall does not meet<br> safety regulations.<br> It was in use 2 weeks ago!<br> Here's the report.<br> - It has no emergency exit!<br> - It never did!<br> With a normal show<br> there's no danger.<br> Your rally might excite people.<br> It's in no way dangerous!<br> I've no reason<br> to hinder your meeting.<br> My decision is based<br> on reports.<br> I'm neutral in this affair.<br> Then why're we being tailed?<br> For your safety! The Minister<br> of lnterior ordered us<br> to protect your committee members<br> from any possible extremists.<br> Whom you are using!<br> Other halls meet<br> the safety requirements,<br> like the Employees' Union Hall<br> opposite your hotel.<br> You simply cross the square!<br> I'm neutral in this affair!<br> Alright, Col.<br> There, on the 1st floor! Not room<br> for over 200 people!<br> We'll look stupid! In a city<br> of 500,000, only 200 would hear you.<br> The rest'll be outside.<br> Ask the Col. to let us hang<br> loudspeakers from the trees.<br> Permit or not, people'll be here!<br> We'll go now...<br> ...and try to alert people.<br> Print posters<br> with the rally's change of address!<br> Manuel, come discuss my speech!<br> George, you too!<br> I'll hold on.<br> Hello, darling! How are you?<br> Fine... yes.<br> Problems with the hall as usual!<br> Why should there be any fights?<br> Why any fights?<br> Yes, tomorrow.<br> George sends a kiss.<br> Till tomorrow, darling!<br> The kids?<br> Fine, but I don't see them enough.<br> Helen?<br> We're not always eye to eye<br> but it's not serious.<br> They say a hungry bear<br> won't dance!<br> The bears are going to read that!<br> Your pen!<br> Go!<br> Hold your meetings in Russia!<br> We'd rather stay here!<br> Do as you're told!<br> Hey, you!<br> What's the idea!<br> - Never mind!<br> - Better than the Bolsho?<br> - I only came to please you.<br> - Your dancers are old-hat.<br> Except when one chooses freedom!<br> And the Warsaw Pact?!<br> We're against the bomb,<br> Russian or American!<br> Disarmament!<br> Long live the Bomb!<br> You could sell 'em<br> to the "Daily Worker"!<br> No more NATO bases!<br> Calm down!<br> No fighting! No provocation!<br> Ya just ease 'em away!<br> Ya don't push!<br> Leave 'em alone!<br> Calm down!<br> Don't provoke 'em!<br> Mr Lawyer!<br> Start now!<br> There's no more room up there!<br> Squeeze 'em in!<br> Get the speakers.<br> Ready?<br> I'll get 'em!<br> Go on in!<br> Let 'em in!<br> - So that's it!<br> - What?<br> The new opposition!<br> Women go for him!<br> Communist?<br> Never! He's anti-foreign!<br> Next elections, he'll win!<br> Good-looking!<br> Ex-Olympic champ, doc,<br> college prof and honest politician!<br> Perfection!<br> He's at the Bolsho!<br> - He must cancel it!<br> - We back down!<br> To avoid provoking the crowd.<br> The students could maintain order.<br> - A free-for-all!<br> - You and your non-violence!<br> We must respect the law!<br> The law of the jungle!<br> They stuck us in that hall.<br> It's a trap!<br> Set by whom?<br> The ClA! We want<br> the foreign bases to be dismantled!<br> You think too much!<br> There are some stubborn extremists...<br> The threats?<br> It's not the 1st time.<br> We've all taken risks.<br> They're all at the Bolsho!<br> Keep trying.<br> The police must face<br> their responsibility.<br> We're going to our rally.<br> Rotten politicians!<br> We'll put ya in your graves!<br> We'll kill ya all!<br> Stay outside!<br> - And you?<br> - I'm a mason.<br> OK, let's go.<br> They hit me.<br> Why?<br> Why do our ideas<br> provoke such violence?<br> Why don't they like peace?<br> Why don't they attack<br> other organisations?<br> The answer is simple.<br> The others are nationalists,<br> used by the government<br> and don't upset<br> our Judas allies who betray us...<br> General, they're getting out of hand!<br> I'll have the loudspeakers cut off!<br> It'd excite the others.<br> Don't do that!<br> Where's the Chief of Police?<br> I was told he's here!<br> Really? He must be over there!<br> We lack hospitals and doctors<br> but half the budget<br> goes for military expenditures.<br> He's the one!<br> A cannon is fired<br> and a teacher's monthly salary<br> goes up in smoke!<br> That's why they can't<br> bear us or our meetings<br> and use hired thugs<br> to jeer and attack us!<br> Around the world. too many soldiers<br> are ready to fire<br> on anything moving toward progress.<br> He's your guy?<br> - You sure?<br> - I think.<br> An Olympic champ?<br> Stop!<br> Finish him off!<br> Shit! It's not him!<br> - I told ya it wasn't!<br> - They said it was!<br> Take off!<br> I'll go around to avoid the cops.<br> Tomatoes out of season!<br> They cost a fortune!<br> Fix your muffler!<br> I can't even make<br> the monthly payments!<br> Shit! The cops!<br> But our fight is theirs too!<br> We live<br> in a weak and corrupt society<br> where it's every man for himself.<br> It's blocked off here too! Hide!<br> Even imagination is suspect<br> yet it's needed<br> to solve world problems.<br> The stockpile of A-bombs is equal<br> to 1 ton of dynamite<br> per person on earth.<br> Horny again?<br> Yeah!<br> They want to prevent us<br> from reaching<br> the obvious political conclusions<br> based on these simple truths.<br> But we will speak out!<br> We serve the people<br> and the people need the truth.<br> Send them back to the Bolsho!<br> The truth is the start<br> of powerful. united action.<br> Get those hoodlums out of here!<br> Down with the police state!<br> No more foreign bases!<br> Inspector!<br> Chief!<br> What're you waiting for?<br> Watch out!<br> Throw him off!<br> It's my cousin. He fell off!<br> By his feet!<br> I saw you hit him!<br> - What?<br> - What's going on?<br> I hit the brake<br> and my cousin fell off.<br> - He's bleeding and needs care.<br> - Your papers!<br> Just a moment...<br> Here they are!<br> He's bleeding! He needs care!<br> He hit him with a club!<br> See? It's nothing!<br> This is nothing?<br> - He tried to kill him!<br> - Dummy!<br> - My truck?<br> - lt'll be OK.<br> Call in for a patrol car.<br> Sure, call the station!<br> Stay there!<br> Look...<br> I'm goin'.<br> Pretend to try and stop me.<br> I can't explain but I gotta go!<br> Just play dead!<br> One move and I'll slug you!<br> What time is it?<br> I got a date I can't miss!<br> The regime can't change that!<br> All the Russians want<br> is to live like Americans!<br> Quick, sir, it's serious!<br> Come with me!<br> The Attorney-General!<br> We'll talk later.<br> And the ballet?<br> I had to miss it!<br> Why wasn't I told?<br> During the performance? How?<br> - What is it?<br> - A stupid traffic accident!<br> The culprit?<br> We'll have him soon.<br> - The victim?<br> - The hospitaI'll tell us.<br> I'll go there in your car.<br> Certainly!<br> Have the papers heard about it?<br> I doubt it.<br> I must call the Ministry!<br> Editorial room!<br> What on earth's wrong?<br> There was a demonstration.<br> We taught the bastards a lesson!<br> They hold a meeting?<br> Well, we can demonstrate too!<br> It's like a biological reaction.<br> Society's healthy elements,<br> the anti-bodies...<br> We beat the hell out of 'em!<br> What do you want from me?<br> Write...<br> ...that I was there and beat 'em up!<br> What for?<br> So my pals'll know!<br> OK, if you want.<br> Get fixed up at the hospital<br> so they'll know<br> both sides were hurt!<br> Go now and I'll put<br> your name in the lead!<br> We warned you<br> but you said it was a hoax<br> - or a crackpot!<br> - Please!<br> This attempted killing<br> is your responsibility!<br> The police has proof<br> it was an accident.<br> Go easy!

You have a copy.<br> Then he saw some university students.<br> Students!<br> Call our students!<br> That one's a mad dog!<br> He wants to make the most of it!<br> - A Jew!<br> - Only half.<br> They think they're superior<br> even to other Jews!<br> - The Att.-Gen.!<br> - Good!<br> Stay on him night and day!<br> We were expecting you!<br> - The 2nd culprit?<br> - We have him.<br> He turned himself in.<br> Come into my office!<br> Please sit down.<br> He's boss now, officially.<br> So you're to give him<br> your initial findings<br> and then follow his instructions.<br> - My deputy'll keep me posted.<br> - The Col.'s men have checked...<br> Can I see the 2nd culprit?<br> Whenever you want to!<br> It seems he was asleep<br> on the truck, dead drunk.<br> So he's innocent,<br> if it all checks out.<br> Their whereabouts earlier?<br> The driver's statement and photo.<br> They'd been drinking<br> at the Chinaman's bar.<br> We have Chinese tradesmen in town?<br> The owner was in the Korean War<br> and now he's called the Chinaman.<br> He backs them up.<br> I'll read his statement.<br> "l, Bertrand... alias the Chinaman...<br> etc... bar owner... etc...<br> "do state<br> that on 22 May of this year,<br> "Yago and Vago<br> came into my bar at 7 p.m.<br> "and stayed until 10 p.m.<br> "They were drinking Pernod."<br> It's not allowed, Madam.<br> "l saw Yago and Vago<br> drinking Pernod all evening.<br> "They left at 10 p.m. drunk.<br> "The Chinaman said<br> Not in the Kamikaze!"<br> Kamikaze?<br> The pickup truck. It's Japanese made.<br> You'd think we're in the Far East!<br> I think it's clear.<br> Though we lack some details<br> on the culprits,<br> - it's obviously an accident.<br> - I agree.<br> Besides, the Minister phoned<br> and wants this settled very quickly<br> to cut short<br> political speculation abroad.<br> I think the prosecutor<br> must make a statement<br> about the accident today<br> and say the culprits are caught<br> and accused of drunken driving<br> and assault and battery.<br> And wilful flight.<br> Naturally!<br> And the man<br> who took him to the clinic?<br> It's for you.<br> He just died.<br> That doesn't change the statement.<br> Instead of "assault and battery",<br> say "manslaughter".<br> Go away, Shoula.<br> I'll wait for you.<br> Who are you?<br> An admirer of your husband.<br> A reporter.<br> No photos!<br> Only a few questions!<br> The public has a right to know!<br> Was it an accident?<br> Or not at all?<br> Yesterday his life was threatened.<br> Did you know?<br> You expected it?<br> You said So they finally did it!<br> What did I say?<br> To the hospital director<br> you said So they finally did it!<br> Who're they?<br> Go away!<br> The culprits have been arrested.<br> You thought of them?<br> Go away!<br> They know already?<br> Yes, and it's only beginning!<br> Unmask the killers!<br> The police is an accomplice!<br> Wait, I don't understand!<br> The fall didn't kill him?<br> Not at all.<br> The skull fracture<br> was due to a blow<br> struck on the head.<br> That's our conclusion.<br> The fall caused minor bruises.<br> You're sure?<br> A blow? You mean by the truck?<br> The truck hit his body.<br> It wasn't serious.<br> The death blow hit his skull<br> and was made by an instrument<br> such as a club,<br> an iron bar or a gun butt.<br> But no one's mentioned a weapon.<br> Continue, Doctor.<br> The skull fracture can only be due<br> to a weapon that struck from above.<br> That's the sole condition that causes<br> symmetrical lesions on the brain<br> touching the subjacent area<br> and the area opposite the wound.<br> An autopsy showed the lesions,<br> the right cerebral hemorrhage<br> and the fracture of the left temple.<br> In the case of a shock<br> due to a fall<br> on a hard surface like the street,<br> such lesions couldn't exist.<br> Why didn't you tell us sooner?<br> Yesterday!<br> Mr Deputy, he was still alive!<br> We needed an autopsy.<br> Time for other tests<br> would've shown the same facts.<br> Another hypothesis is<br> if the truck dragged him,<br> his skull could've hit the curb.<br> It's a fact that he was hit<br> in the middle of the street.<br> Then a fall couldn't cause<br> such lesions.<br> - A phone?<br> - Next door.<br> Yago was driving.<br> The 2nd man was drunk<br> and couldn't have been so precise.<br> A demonstrator.<br> Their story's odd.<br> - Know them well?<br> - Very well!<br> Political?<br> Maybe.<br> - Communists?<br> - Not if they work here!<br> The opposition?<br> One never knows.<br> The General, please.<br> I wanted to see you<br> to clarify a few points.<br> It all seems clear enough to me!<br> A new fact has come up.<br> It's stuffy in here!<br> You saw the accident?<br> How did it happen?<br> In what respect?<br> When the truck arrived,<br> what happened?<br> The Col. and I were there<br> when he walked out<br> waving to the crowd.<br> They didn't applaud him either!<br> He didn't see the truck<br> zigzagging toward him<br> and he was hit!<br> The Col.'s men ran after the truck.<br> but, due to the crowd,<br> they didn't fire.<br> The truck zigzagged<br> and finally got away!<br> The police cleared the square<br> and helped put the victim<br> into a VW to go to the hospital.<br> No trace of the VW driver?<br> Not yet but he must be<br> a friend of theirs.<br> He helped them at once.<br> When the victim was run over,<br> could his head<br> have hit the curb?<br> No, it occurred in the square!<br> - You're sure?<br> - Positive!<br> But what's this new fact?<br> The autopsy says<br> he was killed by a club.<br> A club? Why did the doctors<br> do an autopsy?<br> It's the legal procedure.<br> Yesterday it was all settled!<br> Now you'll foul us up...<br> A new witness.<br> He claims he has proof<br> the senator was assassinated.<br> He'll be here today at 2 p.m.<br> There you are! An assassination!<br> Soon they'll say it was a plot!<br> I saw him! He's drunk!<br> He nearly fell in front of the truck!<br> What happened? You saw it?<br> Yes, he slipped and fell.<br> Anybody here?<br> Anybody here?<br> I'm the Chief of Police.<br> I was on my way to testify<br> and as I walked along...<br> You fell and hit your head.<br> You suffer from epilepsy?<br> Someone hit me!<br> I was on my way to testify<br> the senator was assassinated!<br> It was no accident!<br> Yago told me so himself!<br> I was gonna testify!<br> But someone hit me on the head...<br> from a truck... with a club...<br> ...to keep me quiet.<br> They tried to kill me!<br> I don't know who told you<br> to say this, or why.<br> I don't want to know.<br> We can forget all this.<br> Let's say you were influenced.<br> You're almost one of the family.<br> Your cousin's a policeman,<br> brother-in-law's got<br> a government job. Forget all this.<br> They're coming!<br> If you need anything,<br> come and see me.<br> I'll drop by again.<br> I'm a bachelor and live with my ma.<br> - Profession?<br> - I got a varnish shop.<br> You know Yago?<br> Sure! He makes<br> deliveries for me!<br> The other 2 I don't know.<br> The killing...<br> The accident.<br> ...was the day I phoned Yago<br> about a delivery.<br> Varnished coffins! And I can't<br> even pay off my Kamikaze!<br> Come back this afternoon.<br> I'll be busy.<br> - Tonight then.<br> - I'm busy too.<br> I'm gonna make a real big mistake.<br> It'll be a murder.<br> Next day I learned<br> he'd killed the senator.<br> Yago told you all that?<br> You belong to the party?<br> I never belonged to any party!<br> I like soccer!<br> What is this?<br> The Gen. says I'm epileptic!<br> - General?<br> - The Chief of Police!<br> - He was here?<br> - Just before you came.<br> But I'm no epileptic<br> and never belonged to any party!<br> - Go on about Yago.<br> - That's all. He left.<br> He's the lucky one!<br> What about the delivery?<br> I tried to set him straight<br> but he does as he pleases.<br> Who told you to call<br> the inquest judge?<br> No one! I saw Yago's picture<br> in the papers!<br> On the front page,<br> like a Minister!<br> - Jealous?<br> - You made up this tale.<br> No, someone advised him.<br> Even Ma was against it!<br> She said to keep quiet!<br> - Come and eat.<br> - He killed him.<br> - Who?<br> - A senator.<br> - In the government?<br> - No, a leftist!<br> He did right!<br> What's it to you?<br> His picture too!<br> - Eat and let 'em kill each other!<br> - Not hungry!<br> Later my sister came.<br> So you wanna be a big shot?<br> Just doin' my duty.<br> Your duty's to see to your family!<br> I always have!<br> Ya got an idiot who sees to you!<br> Don't call my husband an idiot!<br> Ya think they'll give ya a medal.<br> I came anyway. Or I would've<br> if they hadn't slugged me!<br> You didn't fall?<br> I'd have to be an acrobat<br> to land on my head!<br> You can sign a statement later<br> if you still want to.<br> Of course! I'm not crazy!<br> They lost no time!<br> Tomorrow you'll have 10, then 15.<br> They'll say Yago did this or that...<br> anything!<br> Vague, worthless statements<br> that'll create unrest!<br> They sent him<br> and beat him up<br> to turn a witness into a martyr!<br> They left him hospitalised<br> yet able to talk!<br> You admit I was beaten<br> and didn't fall?<br> You realise what perjury means?<br> It's not perjury!<br> I wanted to help, but if I'd known...<br> Told ya so! Why'd ya get involved?<br> Weren't ya alright at home?<br> Eat!<br> Suppose you say<br> you slipped on an orange peel?<br> I didn't slip!<br> Why're ya so pigheaded?<br> Listen to me for once!<br> The 1st and last time!<br> - Like always!<br> - Really the last time!<br> Say you slipped and we got<br> no troubles. You won't go to prison.<br> I'll send others to prison!<br> I got 'em!<br> Yago and his picture!<br> Who sent ya?<br> The cops or your daughter?<br> Yes, it's me!<br> Ya wanna ruin my home?<br> Mama, leave!<br> Leave us alone!<br> - Don't argue!<br> - Go outside!<br> Ya hate me<br> 'cause I've succeeded in life!<br> You and your husband hate me!<br> Never mind him!<br> You've caused him enough trouble!<br> Ya wanna ruin my life!<br> When Papa died,<br> I hoped you'd take his place.<br> I needed protection. You neglected me<br> and never took me anywhere!<br> You preferred soccer... and slobs<br> like Yago! See what it's got ya!<br> Prison, maybe... for perjury!<br> And my husband'll lose his job!<br> Come here... Listen!<br> You hear a guy's gonna be killed.<br> Ya don't believe it.<br> Then ya hear he's dead.<br> Would you tell the cops?<br> That's all I did, to help them.<br> Help who?<br> To help the cops find the murderer.<br> You're helping the others!<br> What do you want?<br> Your mother sent me. I'm a reporter.<br> I'll tell you what truly happened<br> 'cause you print just anything!<br> Sure?<br> He wasn't hit. Either he slipped<br> or felt dizzy and fell<br> or else leftists hit him<br> to create trouble.<br> So say the police!<br> They say he's crazy<br> but can't prove it. Can you?<br> - No, I can't!<br> - Then why try?<br> I never said that!<br> He's stubborn as a mule!<br> He never changes his mind!<br> If he doesn't,<br> the inquest'll continue!<br> What if he is crazy?<br> And had epilepsy as a baby?<br> Tell him you and your husband<br> are rightwingers<br> and how ya got your jobs!<br> Yes, I do belong!<br> The cop!<br> - She woke him.<br> - Sleeping?<br> Pictures?<br> For the Press?<br> That's no good!<br> But that way people'll see<br> you were slugged<br> to keep you from saying<br> something important. See?<br> They'll beat me again?<br> They won't dare!<br> You're famous now!<br> But the Press must talk about you!<br> Tell me who saw you here...<br> your sister, the judge...<br> The General! He can't stand me!<br> I wanted to help<br> and got a cold shoulder!<br> They asked if I was a Commie!<br> - Are you?<br> - No! I only like soccer!<br> We'll be on the front page<br> for a week!<br> Sorry!<br> Who was it?<br> I know him!<br> And you're a cardiac case?<br> It's an old fracture!<br> Name and profession?<br> Any convictions?<br> - 4 times.<br> - 4!<br> Yes, 4!<br> Carrying arms illegally,<br> public outrage,<br> theft... and rape.<br> Rape?<br> Not really!<br> I was counselor at a boy scout camp.<br> Why were you in the hospital?<br> The Head of Security put him there.<br> My client has a weak heart.<br> The police doctor certified it.<br> I know but why the plaster cast<br> and a cane like a club?<br> It's 'cause of an old fracture.<br> I was broke when it happened.<br> I needed X-rays and 10 days in bed.<br> and I starve!<br> It was a rich man's fracture!<br> The rich get a cold.<br> A week in bed!<br> For the poor, a fracture means<br> work or the grave!<br> So I had it seen to<br> while I was in the hospital!<br> Where were you that night?<br> At the Chinaman's with Yago till 10.<br> You see Yago often?<br> We're friends and cousins.<br> Was he drunk?<br> Yago drinks a lot!<br> The Chinaman told him<br> not to take the Kamikaze.<br> I got in back and fell asleep.<br> The shock and the yells woke me.<br> I thought we were in a ditch<br> but we were still going!<br> Then a guy leaped onto the Kamikaze<br> as lithe and fierce as a tiger.<br> He grabbed me and threw me off!<br> In the street!<br> He leaped like...?<br> - A tiger.<br> - Before that?<br> Lithe and fierce.<br> Yago used the same words.<br> Yet he didn't see him.<br> A simple coincidence!<br> They haven't met since the accident.<br> The police can swear to it.<br> Continue!<br> I was in the street<br> and almost got run over!<br> Then?<br> I went home.<br> Next day when I read the papers,<br> I went to the cops<br> who put me in hospital.<br> There he got lost in the halls<br> and met that reporter...<br> ...by accident.<br> That agrees with the other testimony.<br> Yet one phrase makes me wonder.<br> It could change my investigation.<br> You're a Red!<br> You and Yago too!<br> Something you said<br> makes me think so.<br> "The rich get a cold. A week in bed!<br> "For the poor, a fracture<br> means work or the grave."<br> You gave yourself away.<br> I hate the communists!<br> Words! I want proof!<br> Only a Red would say such a thing.<br> I belong to an anti-communist group.<br> Yago too!<br> What one?<br> CROC! Christian Royalist<br> Organisation on Communism!<br> You created a storm!<br> Vago's jailed for collusion<br> and that means premeditation!<br> The judge believed you<br> and found out...<br> Vago and Yago belong<br> to a secret society!<br> - Secret?<br> - Yes, the CROC!<br> Anybody knows that!<br> The cops use 'em<br> to keep order at parades!<br> You've nothing to fear now.<br> But in a year I'll be forgotten.<br> No one can touch you.<br> Know anyone<br> who'd show me CROC members?<br> I'd pay.<br> - Sure, it's them!<br> - So help me!<br> Know anyone?<br> Yes.<br> But don't say I told ya!<br> It's Dumas!<br> He was born in Russia.<br> CROC's got a hold on him<br> 'cause of trouble with his brother.<br> He'd like to get to Germany,<br> so if you can get him<br> a passport...<br> I can get one through my newspaper.<br> - Pictures?<br> - Here.<br> I've kept my promise.<br> Now it's your turn.<br> Don't like it?<br> Sure!<br> The questions?<br> Does CROC meet regularly?<br> Where?<br> At a guy's place on the edge of town.<br> Are there many of you?<br> Sometimes.<br> - What goes on?<br> - The boss talks.<br> Religion and the monarchy are<br> the 2 pillars of our eternal land<br> and Western Christian civilisation.<br> If ya don't listen, ya get no work.<br> What else?<br> In Russia a worker can't strike<br> or believe in God<br> or have his own house and garden.<br> He's crushed<br> by a totalitarian regime.<br> You agree?<br> I even read it in the papers.<br> The individual belongs to the State.<br> Yago went to the meetings?<br> Always.<br> They'd talk about capitalists.<br> No more capitalists or workers<br> or Left or Right.<br> A unified people is what we need!<br> We need a clean sweep!<br> Starting with the intellectual scum!<br> The bookstore next door!<br> He'd talk<br> about political youth groups.<br> What'd he say?<br> Unite the youth...<br> And give them a common ideal!<br> Abroad, some say<br> "Make love, not war!"<br> We say "Make war<br> "on corruption and on liberalism<br> "and on indiscriminate liberty!"<br> I say OK, but I don't give a damn.<br> And Yago?<br> He agrees 'cause he wants<br> to pay off his Kamikaze.<br> Now he'll be able to.

I can't!<br> He told me about it.<br> Barone, your picture's<br> in one of the capital's papers!<br> Mine?<br> One that arrives at 10!<br> So at 10:45<br> you go see Pirou at the hospital.<br> Raise hell! Say you're innocent!<br> Scream and shout!<br> Reporters'll be there.<br> Now tell me again?<br> I rush to the hospital...<br> Get outta here!<br> ...to see Pirou.<br> But tell me his name!<br> I can't! He's too big!<br> Alright. Follow me, please.<br> I'm innocent!<br> I only wanted to testify!<br> It's all leftwing politics!<br> This important man...<br> He helped you?<br> Yes, in my work and for my birds.<br> They wake the neighbors.<br> I was gonna have to move!<br> But my birds are pretty!<br> You should see 'em, Judge!<br> He helped me in my work too.<br> My market permit and all that.<br> The day of the accident<br> you saw him?<br> Yes, Jimmy said<br> "The head's downstairs."<br> He was in his car.<br> Get in!<br> You know it's tonight?<br> Impossible!<br> I got some figs due in!<br> They gotta be uncrated.<br> To sell them, you need a stand?<br> I got one.<br> And you need a permit?<br> I got one.<br> But for how much longer?<br> - 6 months.<br> - And who renews permits?<br> He does?<br> Yes.<br> Then he dropped us off.<br> Do a good job tonight.<br> I'm counting on you.<br> You'll get a permanent permit and<br> maybe a new house, for your birds!<br> I said "Colonel, I'll do my best."<br> The police colonel?<br> Yes!<br> Let's start at the beginning.<br> Can you come in, Deputy?<br> Prolonging the inquest<br> gives the opposition<br> fuel for subversive action.<br> - You've sided with them?<br> - It's not a prolongation.<br> It's a totally new case.<br> Some points are awkward<br> but the case is clear!<br> On the contrary.<br> We began with an accident<br> and 2 drunks...<br> Some ice, dear!<br> Their testimony<br> coincides in detail.<br> Confirmed by the Chinaman!<br> Next day, the autopsy says<br> death was due to a blow by a club.<br> A 2nd autopsy will say no,<br> and a confirmation'll disprove<br> the initial autopsy!<br> I'd had no time<br> to examine this new theory<br> when a witness says<br> it was an assassination.<br> Based on a vague discussion!<br> On his way to see me,<br> the witness is clubbed<br> - and is still in the hospital!<br> - What do you mean?<br> I'm only stating facts.<br> Then comes the reporter. He's not<br> a militant and that's important!<br> I learn<br> Yago and Vago belong to CROC,<br> the Christian Royalist...<br> I know, I know...<br> ...along with the assailant<br> of the 2nd senator<br> and most of those<br> at the demonstration.<br> It seems the police know<br> and use them as auxiliaries<br> to maintain order for state visits.<br> That's yet to be proven,<br> like the fact<br> that the Police Col.<br> drove this man<br> to the demonstration.<br> Really!<br> He wouldn't be involved<br> with such a person!<br> Not openly! No one'll believe it!<br> My conclusion is this:<br> As a case of drunken driving,<br> it's simple<br> but impossible.<br> If we accept<br> the premeditated act of a group<br> aided or simply abetted<br> by the police,<br> it all becomes clear<br> and fits together.<br> This is serious!<br> I must phone the Minister!<br> I favor the accident theory.<br> Premeditated, if you wish<br> by 2 drunken fanatics.<br> Yes, you don't smoke!<br> You must settle this quickly!<br> The country, even the whole world<br> is watching and waiting.<br> Our country's honor is at stake!<br> Don't bother with these fools!<br> Your future lies before you!<br> This case can either make...<br> ...or break your career!<br> Trust in my experience!<br> My group is authorised by the State.<br> We are honest citizens,<br> healthy elements of Society,<br> anti-bodies<br> in the fight against infection.<br> We want to protect<br> Western Christian civilisation.<br> But it is a moral struggle.<br> No members of my group<br> were at the demonstration.<br> Where were you that night?<br> I was at the Dockers' Union.<br> Alibi confirmed.<br> I was playing cards with my dentist.<br> Confirmed.<br> I'm a baker.<br> I slept till midnight at my shop!<br> Alibi confirmed.<br> I was at the Chinaman's.<br> Confirmed.<br> At the Chinaman's.<br> Confirmed.<br> I played cards with my dentist.<br> Confirmed.<br> That's not you at the demonstration?<br> It does look like me.<br> Indicted for perjury...<br> ...along with those<br> who confirmed his alibi!<br> Plus obstructing justice!<br> Take him away!<br> Witness 27 has died<br> of a heart attack.<br> He owned the CROC meeting hall.<br> Earlier you stated Yago<br> hit you with a club<br> like a police billy-club.<br> - Do you maintain that?<br> - Yes, Judge.<br> The Att.-Gen. says he phoned you<br> that the senator's life<br> had been threatened.<br> Your superiors<br> never got his message.<br> Yes, I forgot to tell them.<br> That's a serious error!<br> I'll answer to my superiors,<br> not to you, Judge.<br> That morning,<br> you were warned of death threats<br> against the senator.<br> Who told you about them?<br> A colleague's wife.<br> She can't tell us the name.<br> She'll have to.<br> The man says I can tell you.<br> He's waiting in the hall.<br> Bring him in.<br> His name's Coste.<br> - On the assassination day...<br> - The incident!<br> ...he came to my office<br> to tell me of a conversation.<br> But he'll tell it to you better.<br> Don't mention me in the papers.<br> Not my name!<br> Why? Isn't your story true?<br> Yes, but I want no trouble.<br> If you do, come see me.<br> Wait in the hall, please.<br> Name and profession?<br> Ilya Coste, deliveryman.<br> On the assassination day...<br> Day of the incident!<br> An assassination's not yet proven.<br> The day of the incident was rainy...<br> I work myself to death<br> and the bank gets<br> half of what I earn!<br> Someone's calling you!<br> Again!<br> Which one?<br> That one!<br> Go on!<br> I heard Yago say...<br> - If it rains?<br> - So?<br> - We'll skid!<br> - It won't!<br> It won't rain!<br> But I got payments due!<br> We'll cover you.<br> All the payments!<br> The varnisher phoned!<br> He wants ya this afternoon<br> to deliver some coffins!<br> It's a good sign! See you tonight!<br> Then he came over.<br> I'll buy you a drink!<br> As he sat down I saw the club.<br> What's that for?<br> Tonight! A delivery job<br> that'll take care of a lot!<br> What kind?<br> A delivery into hell!<br> A senator from the capital.<br> A dirty job!<br> No one knows.<br> If they do, it'll be by you!<br> Later, the same man came back.<br> He's different in civvies.<br> You knew him?<br> I'd asked for a truck permit.<br> Every 6 months I went to him<br> about it. He was always in uniform.<br> But why pick Yago?<br> He's the best driver in town.<br> You should see him<br> with his Kamikaze.<br> He has a political record.<br> He was in the communist<br> underground in the war<br> - then deported to the islands.<br> - His testimony...<br> ...is suspect, of course.<br> I wouldn't use it.<br> Never mind.<br> They want to eliminate<br> all troublesome witnesses!<br> They just tried to get me!<br> What?<br> Attempted murder! Just now!<br> The plot continues!<br> And will continue!<br> I don't need your advice!<br> This involves the top brass!<br> The police's their toy!<br> And cops haven't the possibility<br> to commit such a murder<br> without being protected!<br> The guilty ones are<br> in the government or at the palace<br> where the General<br> is head of the guards.<br> And the palace<br> takes orders from abroad!<br> One more word<br> and I'll charge you<br> with defamation of the State!<br> This isn't a rally!<br> What happened?<br> They tried to kill me! They knew<br> I had important info for you.<br> So a car tried to run me down<br> on my way here!<br> Any witnesses?<br> Here are 3 honest,<br> God-fearing housewives<br> who'll testify, plus a park guardian,<br> a war vet with medals!<br> What's this information?<br> The police own the VW...<br> That took him away to the hospital?<br> But no cops were allowed<br> in the car to finish him off,<br> so the driver took<br> the longest route. I know!<br> I was there!<br> But the car belongs<br> to one of your friends!<br> He must be a friend!<br> He helped them at once!<br> Who told you such a tale?<br> The car disappeared!<br> No trace of it at the hospital!<br> The page was torn out<br> of the registry!<br> Don't you find that odd?<br> I think you did it<br> to add grist to your mill!<br> Is this the car?<br> Yes.<br> Find the owner of this car!<br> If you wish to wash...<br> Thanks, I'm alright.<br> Sit down.<br> Tell me what you know.<br> But I warn you,<br> you risk indictment for perjury.<br> Go ahead.<br> The car was waiting there,<br> hidden by the police.<br> And when the truck came?<br> He came forward.<br> Inspector!<br> Chief!<br> He wanted the General<br> to clear the square.<br> Come on!<br> What're you waiting for?<br> I saw the truck arrive.<br> Watch out!<br> The man in back was standing up?<br> Did he hit him?<br> I dunno. It happened too fast.<br> And then?<br> He fell to his knees.<br> His knees?<br> His head hit the pavement?<br> No. he was on his knees<br> surrounded by the demonstrators.<br> The police did nothing.<br> Which demonstrators?<br> Impossible to say.<br> We pulled him free.<br> Then he collapsed.<br> A VW arrived<br> from where, I don 't know.<br> ,<br> Finally, the cops intervened<br> and tried to get into the car.<br> Come on!<br> Get to the hospital!<br> Get going!<br> Faster! Honk your horn!<br> Is it broken?<br> Turn right!<br> This way avoids traffic!<br> He did it to waste time.<br> Then, he hit another car!<br> ,<br> Keep going!<br> I need a damage report!<br> A man's hurt!<br> It's a matter of life or death!<br> OK, go on!<br> He did it on purpose!<br> And the cops would've<br> killed him in the car!<br> On purpose?<br> I did my best! They were upset,<br> I can understand that.<br> No one noticed me at the hospital.<br> I'd rented the car<br> for an afternoon date<br> and was on my way home.<br> Roadblocks were up.<br> I must not have noticed the police.<br> At the hospital I washed<br> the seats of the blood.<br> You said "I'm a part-time chauffeur".<br> But you're a serviceman!<br> - I'm doing my military service.<br> - What branch?<br> As a policeman.<br> You're a police chauffeur!<br> What section?<br> One close to the General.<br> How close?<br> Personal.<br> Since when?<br> The General's driver for 1 year.<br> You were at the scene<br> of the murder by accident.<br> Shall I write "murder"?<br> You said "murder".<br> Do you know who has arrived?<br> The Nat'l. Att.-Gen.!<br> Leave us alone.<br> The Nat'l. Att.-Gen.<br> has come to talk to you...<br> ...totally incognito.<br> Yes, he's here.<br> I'll bring my files at once.<br> So it's you... Sit down.<br> You're ready to indict<br> the Chief of Police?<br> It's inevitable.<br> My friend,<br> only Divine Will is inevitable!<br> Proof is overwhelming, sir.<br> Proof? Hearsay!<br> So-called proof<br> by so-called pacifists<br> who want to create a hero!<br> That's certain, sir,<br> but police complicity<br> with the demonstrators is certain.<br> Those 2 men circled in red<br> are plain-clothes men.<br> They admit being<br> in the demonstration.<br> We also know<br> the Police Chief met Yago that day<br> plus other demonstrators.<br> The General said<br> he didn't know the driver of the VW.<br> But he's the General's<br> personal chauffeur!<br> I won't mention<br> the police's passiveness.<br> Then comes<br> the intimidation of witnesses.<br> Vago is hospitalised secretly<br> with a police medical certificate.<br> He's found near the room<br> of a major witness, with a club!<br> Then there's Yago's club<br> during the demonstration.<br> Several witnesses saw it.<br> It disappeared when he was arrested.<br> But the agent admitted<br> rewriting his report.<br> You shouldn't mention<br> the club in your report.<br> But it's done, sir!<br> I'm the Police Chief General!<br> At ease!<br> Don't worry. You did your duty.<br> You've been a policeman how long?<br> Just rewrite your report.<br> Ah! The Att.Gen.!<br> And then you arrived, sir.<br> He couldn't lie. On the contrary!<br> His confession'll cost him a lot.<br> There is a case for indictment,<br> but not enough for a jury<br> to condemn the police.<br> The jury'll do its duty.<br> I've done mine.<br> You'll discredit the police<br> and the court<br> who will be blamed<br> for absolving them.<br> As if it's not enough<br> our country's been invaded...<br> by long-haired atheists and addicts.<br> Now you want to cast doubts<br> on our armed forces,<br> the sole healthy elements<br> in our country.<br> We dream of a renewal<br> of a land with no parties,<br> left nor right,<br> obedient to God.<br> You want to ruin it.<br> Listen...<br> I have a proposal for you.<br> I understand your scruples.<br> They honor you.<br> My idea should suit you<br> and the government and the palace.<br> We'll divide the case in 3.<br> Let justice be done!<br> Their negligence is evident<br> but can't be tried<br> by a circuit court.<br> It's strictly<br> an administrative matter.<br> against the rally organisers.<br> They and their loudspeakers are<br> responsible for the ensuing violence.<br> An old rule of thumb<br> is to always look for those<br> who benefit from a crime.<br> The Minister of Justice<br> thought you're a Leftist.<br> I formally denied it.<br> Here's a list of helpful witnesses.<br> It seems no one wanted to kill<br> the senator. Just intimidate him.<br> I trust I've convinced you<br> to save the honor<br> of the forces of law and order.<br> But you're the sole master<br> of your conscience, after God.<br> I won't be disgraced!<br> Indict me and I'll commit suicide!<br> Dishonor is unbearable!<br> My blood'll be on your hands!<br> Name and profession?<br> You must answer.<br> Sign your statement.<br> You are indicted<br> for premeditated murder.<br> The law allows 24 hours<br> to superior officers<br> before their imprisonment.<br> To avoid the reporters,<br> use that door.<br> You're indicted<br> for premeditated murder.<br> It's unbearable!<br> You've no right!<br> I've been thrown to the hounds!<br> Name and profession?<br> You're indicted<br> for premeditated murder.<br> Sit down.<br> For me there's no choice!<br> Either I'm cleared<br> or I'll commit suicide!<br> Name and profession?<br> It's routine, General!<br> What did you do that day?<br> I was to attend the Bolsho Ballet.<br> Not out of love for the dance!<br> I'm not one of those perverts!<br> But it was a chance<br> to spot some Reds.<br> The day of the assassination<br> you were told<br> his life was threatened.<br> No one told me about it!<br> I'm sure it was only a tactic<br> to justify any incidents.<br> My men couldn't stop the truck<br> but a man leaped<br> on the rear platform,<br> lithe and fierce as a tiger.<br> I know no one in that organisation.<br> I've had no contacts<br> with this... CROC.<br> You're seen here at a banquet<br> you gave for them.<br> To thank them for keeping order<br> during a state visit.<br> Is he a Red? Why's he after me?<br> His father was police chief.<br> The photo's phony! It's not proof!<br> You're indicted<br> for premeditated murder!<br> Are you a martyr like Dreyfus?<br> Dreyfus was guilty!<br> Helen! They're all indicted,<br> even the General!<br> The judge didn't back down!<br> Helen, it's like he was still alive!<br> It's a real revolution!<br> The government'll fall<br> and extremists'll be wiped out!<br> Elections'll be a landslide!<br> THE TRlAL<br> The Deputy was not at the trial.<br> He died of a heart attack,<br> according to the coroner.<br> before the trial.<br> A car accident,<br> a gas explosion,<br> a suicide, a drowning,<br> a work accident,<br> a 2nd car accident<br> and a heart attack while driving.<br> "Foul play is doubted"<br> says the new Chief of Police.<br> Vago was sentenced<br> to 8 years in a farm prison<br> where 1 year equals 2 years.<br> Yago got 11 years of the same.<br> of paying it off.<br> The 4 indicted officers only<br> received administrative reprimands.<br> Yet the government had to resign.<br> After the trial, the Leftists<br> seemed certain to win the elections.<br> Prior to the elections, the army<br> seized power and dismissed the judge.<br> Senator George Pirou died in a police<br> car of a clot on the brain,<br> said police officers.<br> Deported to the islands.<br> During questioning,<br> fell from the 7th floor<br> trying to escape,<br> said the police.<br> official documents.<br> Also. the military regime banned<br> long hair, mini-skirts.<br> Sophocles, Tolstoy.
