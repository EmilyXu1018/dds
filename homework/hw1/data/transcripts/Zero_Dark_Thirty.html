You're<br> a garbageman in the corporation!<br> What should I respect you, huh?<br> - Why?<br> - And you're a moneyman.<br> Paperboy.<br> A disgrace to humanity. You and your<br> uncle murdered 3,000 innocent people.<br> Yeah.<br> I have your name...<br> on a $5,000 transfer via<br> Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker.<br> And you got popped...<br> with 150 kilograms of high<br> explosives in your house!<br> And then you dare question me?<br> Come on, man, I'm fucking with you.<br> No, I don't want to talk about 9/11 yet.<br> What I want to focus<br> on is the Saudi group.<br> That, there, is Hazem al-Kashmiri.<br> And I know this dude is<br> up to some serious shit.<br> What I want from you is his Saudi e-mail<br> Ammar, bro, I know<br> that you know this dude.<br> Just give me his e-mail, and I<br> will-I will give you a blanket.<br> I will give you a blanket<br> and some solid food.<br> I know that you know him.<br> I told you before, I won't talk to you.<br> Have it your way.

You<br> guys met in Iran back in the nineties.<br> I don't know!<br> Fuck you!<br> I want the e-mails of the<br> rest of the Saudi group.<br> Give me one e-mail and I will stop this.<br> Who's in the Saudi group?<br> And what's the target?<br> Where was the last<br> time you saw bin Laden?<br> Where was the last time<br> you saw bin Laden, huh?<br> You know when you lie to me, I hurt you.<br> This is what defeat looks like, bro.<br> Your jihad is over.<br> Get him up.<br> Try to understand the concept here.<br> Okay, I have time. You don't.<br> I have other things to do but you don't.<br> It'-it's cool that you're<br> strong. I respect it, I do.<br> But in the end, everybody<br> breaks, bro. That's biology.<br> Can you open the trunk, ma'am?<br> It's clear.<br> How'd it go the other night?<br> It was good. I mean the local cops<br> need a little tactical help, but...<br> he's tier-fucking-one, baby.<br> That's your money maker right there.<br> And this is the guy that's KSM's nephew.<br> - Yeah.<br> - And what's his issue?<br> He's being a dick.<br> Well, if he's tying to outsmart you,<br> why don't you tell him about your PhD?<br> Yeah. No, but I am gonna have to<br> turn up the heat on this asshole.<br> He needs to give up the Saudi group now.<br> He's gotta have that,<br> given the family ties.<br> He's tight with his uncle. He's<br> got his prints all over 9/11 money.<br> He's got 'em in his head,<br> he needs to disclose 'em.<br> Good.<br> Bill, she's good to go. I'll<br> get her the right one tomorrow.<br> Was I lying or what?<br> Uh, Maya, this is Joseph Bradley,<br> our illustrious station chief.<br> Joe and I did Iraq together.<br> - It's nice to meet you.<br> - You too, sir.<br> - How's your flight?<br> - Fine.<br> Um, she's been having a great time<br> since she got in, isn't that right?<br> - Good. How do you like Pakistan so far?<br> - It's kinda fucked up.<br> - You volunteered for this, didn't you?<br> - No.<br> Third floor, northeast corner.<br> You don't think she's a little<br> young for the hard stuff?<br> - Washington says she's a killer.<br> - Hmm.<br> Children's crusade, huh?<br> They wanna put the next<br> generation on the field.<br> Listen, I've got a meeting<br> with ISI in twenty minutes.<br> They're slow-rolling us on Lahore,<br> you might wanna bitch about that.<br> Did I tell you this? That, uh, this dude<br> in Malaysia, tells a Malaysian<br> station that his nephew...<br> - works with a guy, who knows a guy...<br> - Aww, here we go.<br> No, hold on. He goes to a big<br> feast in Bangkok, about a year ago.<br> Guest of honor: Osama bin Laden.<br> - Except if it was Tupac there...<br> - This is worth 5 million bucks.<br> You know we gonna have to chase it down.<br> He's like, "Hey, that's<br> me, man. No job too small. "<br> That's why I have a<br> gift for you, my friend.<br> Everyone, Agent Maya. Maya, everyone.<br> Please don't ask her how<br> it's going with Ammar,<br> 'cause she's not gonna fucking tell you.<br> Ammar is withholding.<br> Washington assesses Abu Faraj<br> as officially the new "Number 3".<br> He's the best man for it.<br> Uh, yeah, the...<br> London station's already asking if<br> he's contacting anybody in the UK.<br> - Like we're just keeping it from them?<br> - Yeah.<br> Jordanians are being really<br> helpful with Ammar's transit papers.<br> Any imminent threats in here?<br> Oh, we've one on the consulate,<br> the Marriott, it's low-security.<br> Um, and they've got Maj Khan talking<br> about, uh, gas stations in the US.<br> And that's a conversation?<br> Honestly, there's 600 questions in<br> there. I'd do Heathrow, the Saudis.<br> Does it matter what Faraj<br> thinks about Heathrow?<br> How much latitude does<br> he get to pick targets?<br> Um, I think he'll give up the<br> Saudis, but Heathrow's gonna be tough.<br> Anyway, uh... anything from last night?<br> Qatar Base Six have a bead<br> on the Arabs that escaped.<br> They're meeting with ISI this afternoon,<br> hopefully set up a raid down there.<br> Great.<br> And Lahore reporting, ISI was<br> painfully slow last night, again.<br> They're beginning to think<br> it's not incompetence.<br> Okay, agree. I spoke to the chief<br> about that. Yeah, anything on bin Laden?<br> Uh, farmer on the Afghan<br> border near Tora Bora...<br> reports a diamond-shaped<br> pattern in the hills,<br> tall male in the center of the<br> diamond, flanked by four guards,<br> consistent with UBL's movements.<br> That's supposed to be his Royal Guard.<br> No, that's pre-9/11 behavior.<br> We have no reason to believe<br> he's changed security tactics.<br> We invaded Afghanistan, that's a reason.<br> Hey, boss. I got a guy,<br> for 5,000 bucks, he can set up a<br> taxi stand, and snoop around a bit.<br> No, don't need him. Sorry, the<br> diamond sighting is bullshit.<br> Uh, see if the Paks will send someone<br> to talk to the farmer. Anything else?<br> No?<br> All right, let's put some runs<br> on the board against Faraj, okay?<br> Talk to the case officers who didn't see<br> fit to make it today, and "thank" them.<br> Tora Bora, yeah?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Good.<br> Come on, here we go.<br> Here we go.<br> All right, let's just, uh...<br> Let's take it easy today, huh?<br> You hungry?<br> Food in here sucks, so I<br> brought you some of this.<br> Pretty good, huh?<br> Richard Reid.<br> Oh, man, I was thinking about him.<br> The guy gets a bomb in a shoe on<br> a plane. Un-fucking-believable.<br> You know him, don't you?<br> Yes.<br> I'm glad you said that.<br> Okay, uh, I got an e-mail from you to<br> him, with all your comms for years, bro.<br> Who, um...<br> Who else is in your Saudi group?<br> I just handed out some cash for them.<br> I didn't know who the guys were.<br> When you lie to me, I hurt you.<br> Please.<br> I believe you. I do, I believe you.<br> It's good, huh?<br> Do you want the water again?<br> Or do you want something else?<br> - Water?<br> - Please.<br> Just... give me a name.<br> I don't know!<br> Come on, let's go!<br> Bring him up.<br> Here we go.<br> You see how this works?<br> You don't mind if my female colleague<br> here checks out your junk, do you?<br> No? Good.<br> Dude, you shit your pants?<br> You stay here, I'll be back.<br> Your friend is an animal.<br> Please, help me.<br> Please.<br> You can help yourself by being truthful.<br> This is a dog collar.<br> - No!<br> - Hang on.<br> You determine how I treat you.<br> Come on.<br> I got you.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> You're my dog, I gotta walk you.<br> What the fuck do you<br> think is going on, Ammar?<br> Walid has already told<br> me that you know, hmm?<br> Here we go.<br> This box here. This box sucks.<br> And I'm gonna put you in it.<br> When is the attack?<br> When is the attack?<br> - S...<br> - What?<br> - What?<br> - "Ahad. " (Sunday)<br> Sunday, where? Whoa... Sunday, where?<br> Sunday. This Sunday or next Sunday?<br> Where?<br> What?<br> Come on, Ammar, is it Sunday or Monday?<br> Partial information will be<br> treated as a lie. Come on, let's go.<br> Come on, which day is it?<br> Partial information... You<br> gonna go in the box, huh?<br> Partial information is<br> treated as a lie! Let's go!<br> - Saturday!<br> - In the box you go!<br> - Sunday!<br> - Almost.<br> Monday!<br> - Tuesday!<br> - Huh? There we go.<br> - Friday!<br> - Come on, let's go! Come on!<br> - Hang on...<br> - Sunday.<br> - Monday.<br> - Shh...<br> Thursd...<br> Ammar, which day is it?<br> Which day?<br> Frid...<br> - Ammar, which day?<br> - Thursd...<br> Frid...<br> "Yalla! Yalla! Yalla!" (Let's go!)<br> "Yalla! Yalla! Yalla!"<br> ...attack against<br> westerners and foreigners.<br> When you look at the<br> break-up of casualties,<br> you can see that non-muslims were<br> killed, and so were Americans...<br> You don't worry about the Saudis,<br> they'll take care of business.<br> Yeah, now.<br> You warned them, they<br> didn't take you seriously.<br> This is what happens. It's not on you.<br> Oh, and who said that, huh? Zayid? Fuck<br> him. This is on me. Ammar is on me,<br> - and it's on her. And, we do not,<br> - No, no, no. Now, you had what, days?<br> - we cannot let this be a win-win for AQ<br> - Brief custody, unresponsive ally.<br> The way you do this, is look ahead.<br> London, Heathrow, mass casualties.<br> The plan is still active.<br> Ammar doesn't have a<br> clue about what happened.<br> - Oh, he knows.<br> - How?<br> Oh, you have to be really careful with<br> people in KSM's circle, they're devious.<br> He's not gonna talk about<br> attacks in the homeland.<br> He's gonna withhold operational<br> details on the KSM network...<br> and probably bin Laden.<br> But he's been in complete isolation.<br> He doesn't know we've failed.<br> We could tell him anything.<br> What? Bluff him?<br> He hasn't slept in. He's clueless.<br> You don't remember, do you?<br> Well, short-term memory loss is a<br> side effect of sleep deprivation,<br> so it should come back to you.<br> I don't know.<br> How can I remember?<br> After we kept you awake for 96 hours you<br> gave us the names of<br> some of your brothers,<br> and you helped save the lives<br> of a lot of innocent people.<br> Which is a smart thing to do when<br> you're starting to think for yourself.<br> Mm-hm.<br> Come on, eat up, man.<br> Some hummus, tabbouleh, don't know<br> what that is, some figs. You earned it.<br> So uh you flew via Amman to Kabul, yeah?<br> Hang out with your uncle.<br> Mukhtar.<br> - How did you know that?<br> - I told you, man, I know you.<br> All right, you got me.<br> You did, you got me.<br> Flight manifests.<br> It must be pretty fucked<br> up for you guys after 9/11.<br> And what did you do, um, what<br> did you do after the invasion?<br> Before you went back to Pesh?<br> After 9/11, we had to choose.<br> Fight to protect our turf or run.<br> And you chose to fight, yeah?<br> We wanted to kill Americans.<br> Yeah.<br> We tried to get into Tora Bora, but the<br> bombing was too high. We couldn't cross.<br> I'm sorry, who's the<br> "we" in that sentence?<br> Me, and some other guys who<br> were hanging around at that time.<br> You know, I can always go<br> and eat with some other dude,<br> hang you back up to the ceiling.<br> Hamza Rabia.<br> Khabab al-Masri.<br> And Abu Ahmed.<br> Who's Abu Ahmed? I've<br> heard of the other guys.<br> He was a computer guy<br> with us at the time.<br> After Tora Bora, I went<br> back to Pesh, as you know.<br> Mm-hm.<br> And they went north, I think, to Kunar.<br> What's his family name?<br> Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.<br> Abu Ahmed means "father<br> of Ahmed", it's a kunya.<br> Ammar, I know the difference between<br> a war name and an Arabic name.<br> She got you there, dude.<br> I swear to you both, I<br> don't know his family name.<br> I would have never asked him something<br> like that. It's not how my uncle worked.<br> I know.<br> My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden<br> Um, I did see him, once,<br> about a year ago, in Karachi.<br> He read us all a letter<br> from the "Sheik".<br> A letter?<br> What'd it say?<br> Cigarette?<br> It said, "Continue the jihad. "<br> "The work will go on<br> for a hundred years. "<br> You and I are gonna talk about some of<br> the guys at the training camps, yeah?<br> Okay.<br> Some of these brothers<br> have done some bad things.<br> What I wanna do is, I wanna separate<br> them from the people like you.<br> Definitely, yeah.<br> All right, a guy called<br> Abu Ahmed, from Kuwait.<br> Yes, I remember him. The nice guy.<br> How close was he? What was his<br> relationship to the leadership?<br> I don't know.<br> Did he eat with you guys?<br> Did he eat with the good guys,<br> or did he eat with the leadership?<br> I don't know, sir. I<br> have no idea about it.<br> That's something you<br> don't need an idea about.<br> When you met Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,<br> was this one of the facilitators?<br> Is this Abu Ahmed?<br> - KSM, your boss.<br> - Mukhtar.<br> "Mukhtar"... "Potato"...<br> You say, "Po-tah-to"; I say, "Fucking<br> KSM"; you say, "Mukhtar", okay?<br> Now, after Mukhtar was<br> captured, what did Abu Ahmed do?<br> Abu Ahmed. I believe... I believe,<br> he went to work for the "Sheik".<br> Is that him?<br> - Say it.<br> - Abu Ahmed.<br> - Say it again.<br> - Abu Ahmed.<br> Abu Ahmed.<br> Abu Ahmed.<br> How's the needle in the haystack?<br> Fine.<br> Facilitators come and go.<br> One thing you can count on in<br> life is that everyone wants money.<br> You're assuming that al-Qaeda members<br> are motivated by financial rewards.<br> They're radicals.<br> Correct. You're assuming that, uh,<br> greed won't override ideology<br> in some of the weaker members.<br> Money for walk-ins worked great in<br> the Cold War, I'll give you that.<br> Thank you.<br> He says it looks like Abu Ahmed.<br> Who did he work for?<br> He was mostly with Abu Faraj.<br> They were always together.<br> What did he do for Faraj?<br> He carried messages from<br> Abu Faraj to bin Laden,<br> from bin Laden back to Abu Faraj.<br> We need to ask him something to<br> see if he's telling the truth.<br> We don't know if he really knew Faraj.<br> He just told me the names of<br> all of Abu Faraj's children.<br> I think he's telling the truth.<br> Twenty detainees recognized<br> that photo of Abu Ahmed.<br> They say he's part of an inner circle...<br> of guys that was hanging<br> out in Afghanistan pre-9/11.<br> A lot of them say that after<br> When KSM was captured, he<br> went to work for Abu Faraj.<br> Primarily as a courier,<br> from Faraj to bin Laden.<br> That's good, but you still don't have...<br> Yeah, but we don't know if Abu's<br> on the outside of the network.<br> A series of cut-outs and dead drops,<br> or if he has a direct<br> connection to bin Laden.<br> I mean, does bin Laden invite<br> him into the living room,<br> and hand him a letter directly,<br> or is Abu just the last guy...<br> in a long line of couriers, and<br> that's why everybody knows him.<br> That's not all you don't know.<br> You don't have his real name.<br> - You don't have a clue of where he is.<br> - Yes, but we know that he's important.<br> The fact that everybody's<br> heard of Abu Ahmed,<br> but nobody will tell me<br> where he is, suggests that.<br> Maybe.<br> Detainees can withhold his<br> location for any number of reasons.<br> Perhaps they don't know.<br> Perhaps this "Abu" is actually a cover<br> story and he's really a fucking unicorn.<br> But the withholding doesn't reveal<br> what you want it to, does it?<br> No.<br> And if you did find him, you don't<br> know that he'd be with bin Laden.<br> We don't know what we don't know.<br> What the fuck is that supposed to mean?<br> It's tautology.<br> Listen, not one single detainee has said<br> that he's been located with the big guy.<br> Just that he delivers<br> messages, am I wrong?<br> No.<br> It's still good work. Let me know when<br> you've got some actual intelligence.<br> Preferably, something<br> that leads to a strike.<br> This is what remains of the No. 10 bus,<br> which was travelling through<br> Tavistock Square, near Euston station.<br> There'd been explosions near Liverpool<br> Street and Edgware Road stations too.<br> Dozens of the survivors<br> were critically injured,<br> but many of the wounded were<br> also keen to share their stories.<br> We just pulled out of Edgware Road,<br> and next thing I know, is a<br> loud, um, large flash of light.<br> Uh, I felt a burning sensation on my<br> hands, put my hands up to my face...<br> Uh, I was on the floor by that point...<br> Yeah, I can't recall anything prior<br> to that anymore. Any noise, any bang...<br> Normal life in one of the busiest parts<br> of the capital has now been suspended.<br> Just a few yards down the road here,<br> they continue to care for the injured.<br> And all around, groups of Londoners are<br> standing on corners, asking themselves,<br> "What has happened here, and who<br> could possibly have done this?"<br> Come on.<br> You too, come on.<br> You agency guys are twisted.<br> Detainee's ready for you.<br> Come on. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...<br> I want you to understand that I know you<br> I've been following you, and<br> studying you, for a long time.<br> I chased you in Lahore.<br> I had you picked up<br> instead of killing you,<br> because you're not a violent<br> man, and you don't deserve to die.<br> Thank you.<br> But you do have deep ties to<br> al-Qaeda I want to ask you about,<br> before you get sent to your next<br> location, which might be Israel.<br> However, depending on how<br> candid you are here today,<br> I may be able to keep you in Pakistan.<br> What do you want to know?<br> I'm gonna ask you a series of questions,<br> based on your knowledge of al-Qaeda,<br> and your position as key<br> financier for the organization.<br> I have dealt with the horrors.<br> I have no wish to be tortured again.<br> Ask me a question, I will answer it.<br> What can you tell me<br> about Atiyah Abdul-Rahman?<br> He works for Zawahiri. He's<br> in charge of military tactics.<br> In what context have you<br> ever heard the name Abu Ahmed?<br> He works for Faraj and bin Laden.<br> He is his most trusted courier.<br> What makes you say that?<br> He brought me many<br> messages from the "Sheik".<br> Where did you last see<br> him, and where is he now?<br> - You will never find him.<br> - Why is that?<br> Even I couldn't find him. He<br> always contacted me out of the blue.<br> He's one of "the disappeared ones".<br> You're in luck, I got you<br> a one-on-one with Faraj.<br> Seriously? Thank you.<br> Don't you thank me until<br> you hear what I want for it.<br> I want you to take care of all<br> this before your favorite subject.<br> Deal.<br> Don't you wanna see whats in the folder?<br> You want family ties, financial networks<br> media sources, disgruntled employees,<br> imminent threats, homeland plots,<br> foreign sales, health status,<br> financial resources, tradecraft,<br> recruiting tactics, anything else?<br> - No, I think that covers it.<br> - Yeah.<br> Huh?<br> "What they say is true. The Shaolin<br> and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous. "<br> What do you like to be called?<br> "Faraj", "Fareej", "Buzzie"?<br> C'mon, dude, what do you<br> like? You like a bit of, uh...<br> You guys like a bit of Bob<br> Marley, with the Reggae?<br> Kick back, take it easy after<br> you've blown some shit up?<br> Huh?<br> No?<br> Got some Libyan music you like?<br> You did the UK bombings, right?<br> Well, you're the second "Number<br> Can I be honest with you?<br> I'm bad fuckin' news.<br> I'm not your friend.<br> Not gonna help you.<br> I'm gonna break you.<br> Any questions?<br> No?<br> All right, you haven't eaten in 18<br> hours. We need to keep your energy up.<br> You hungry?<br> A lot of brothers told us,<br> Abu Ahmed was Bin Laden's courier, and<br> that he worked very closely with you.<br> You are thinking of Abu Khaled.<br> - Who?<br> - al-Baluchi, my courier for the "Sheik"<br> Okay, so you're telling me, all<br> the other brothers are wrong.<br> And there's some famous "Baluchi"<br> guy, working for you and bin Laden,<br> that I've never even heard of.<br> - Why should you have heard of him?<br> - What does this Baluchi guy look like?<br> Tall. Long white beard.<br> - Thin. He uses a cane.<br> - Kinda like Gandalf.<br> Who?<br> When was the last time you saw him?<br> A month ago, in Karachi.<br> But I don't know where he is now.<br> Sometimes, I wouldn't even see him.<br> He would just tell me,<br> where to leave the messages.<br> You're not being fulsome in your replies<br> You cannot force me to tell<br> you something I don't know.<br> You do realize this is not a normal<br> prison? You determine how you're treated<br> And your life is gonna be<br> very uncomfortable, until...<br> you give me the information I need!<br> Where exactly is Abu<br> Ahmed living at the moment?<br> Faraj is completely<br> denying knowing Abu Ahmed.<br> That's using every measure we have.<br> Well, he's either gonna keep withholding<br> or he's gonna die from the<br> presssure you're putting on him.<br> Hey, you wanna take a run at him?<br> No.<br> No?<br> - No.<br> - Since when? No.<br> You know, I was meaning to tell<br> you, I'm getting outta here.<br> - You okay?<br> - Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just...<br> You know, I think I've<br> seen too many guys naked.<br> It's gotta be over a fucking<br> hundred at this point.<br> I need to go and do<br> something normal for a while.<br> Like what?<br> I'll go to Washington, do the dance,<br> see how that environment works.<br> You should come with me.<br> Yeah, be my number two. You're<br> looking a little strung out yourself.<br> I'm not gonna find Abu Ahmed from DC.<br> They killed my monkeys.<br> Some bullshit about escaping,<br> you fucking believe that?<br> Sorry, Dan.<br> Look, Maya, you gotta be real<br> careful with the detainees now.<br> Okay, politics are changing,<br> and you don't wanna be...<br> the last one holding a dog collar,<br> when the Oversight Committee comes.<br> - I know.<br> - Yeah?<br> And watch your back when you get back to<br> Pakistan. Everyone knows you there now.<br> Sorry. Fucking checkpoints.<br> - Maya?<br> - Yeah?<br> We're socializing. Be social.<br> Okay.<br> Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby,<br> but it is time to cut the umbilical cord<br> - No, it's not.<br> - So Faraj went south on you, it happens<br> There are still cells<br> in London and Spain,<br> who are planning the<br> next round of attacks.<br> I could work on it at the same time.<br> Plus, I think it's a good thing he lied.<br> No, not at the expense of<br> protecting the homeland, you can't...<br> Wait a minute. Why is it a good thing?<br> You sound just like Bradley. He<br> doesn't believe in my lead either.<br> It's a good thing,<br> because the fact that Faraj withheld<br> on Abu Ahmed is very revealing.<br> The only other thing Faraj lied about,<br> was the location of bin Laden himself.<br> That means Faraj thinks Abu Ahmed's just<br> as important to protect as bin Laden.<br> - That confirms my lead.<br> - Or it's confirmation bias.<br> Mmm...<br> We're just worried about you,<br> okay? Is that okay to say?<br> I mean, look how run-down you are.<br> Where's Jack?<br> Probably stuck in some<br> checkpoint, somewhere.<br> You two hooked up yet?<br> Hello, I work with him. I'm not that<br> girl that fucks. It's unbecoming.<br> So, a little fooling<br> around wouldn't hurt you.<br> Hmph...<br> - So, no boyfriend?<br> - Mm-mm.<br> You got any friends at all?<br> That's Jack.<br> Hey.<br> That's okay.<br> Come on!<br> Come on!<br> Go!<br> Come on, over here!<br> The blast left a crater, 10 meters or<br> Police tell CNN, the driver of the<br> truck bomb tried to talk his way pass...<br> the hotel's steel security<br> gate. When armed guards said no,<br> police said, the driver detonated<br> more than 2,000 pounds of explosives.<br> The Marriott, one of the most popular<br> destinations for locals and westerners..<br> in Islamabad, now destroyed.<br> The Jords have a mole.<br> What?<br> He made this video to<br> prove his bona fides.<br> Shut up.<br> Humam Khalil al-Balawi.<br> He's a Jordanian doctor.<br> He's right there in the inner circle.<br> I don't buy it. Didn't you tell me<br> yourself, nobody turns on al-Qaeda?<br> The Jordans have worked him for a year,<br> dinners, money. They convinced him...<br> it's his patriotic duty to turn<br> on al-Qaeda, and get rich doing it.<br> - Yeah, well, so the Jords say.<br> - Yeah, you're right.<br> We can't rely on this or the Jords.<br> We've gotta evaluate him face-to-face.<br> He may not be that smart,<br> he may be full of shit.<br> But we have to talk to him and find out.<br> The key is to meet him,<br> so we can figure out for<br> ourselves what he can actually do.<br> He really asked for a dialysis machine?<br> Maybe we can fill the<br> damn thing with poison.<br> The meeting with Balawi is<br> off. He can't come to Islamabad.<br> - Can't or won't?<br> - He's not gonna travel. Security risk.<br> ...and, uh, I've said repeatedly,<br> that America doesn't torture.<br> And I'm gonna make sure that we don't<br> torture. Those are part and parcel of...<br> an-an effort to regain, uh,<br> America's moral stature in the world.<br> Can you give us some sense<br> of when you might start...<br> He... wants us to go to him.<br> He'll meet us in Maidan<br> Shar with the Tribals.<br> He knows you're white,<br> we'd get kidnapped there.<br> Could we do it somewhere else? Germany?<br> in the UK? He's got a clean passport.<br> He's not gonna travel<br> out of al-Qaeda territory.<br> - And you're not going to him.<br> - I'm not, believe me.<br> We're stuck.<br> What about Camp Chapman...<br> Afghanistan? That can be safe territory.<br> This may be going overboard,<br> but I baked him a cake.<br> Muslims don't celebrate with cake.<br> Don't be so literal, everyone likes cake<br> It's not too late for you to<br> come, you know, it'll be fun.<br> No, I don't want to be a straphanger.<br> It's your show. You were the<br> first to see the potential in this.<br> Oh, come on, we've got lots of wine.<br> Cool, bring me back a bottle.<br> That, I will do.<br> Not to get technical,<br> but this guy is actually the first<br> big break we've had since 9/11.<br> To big breaks, and the little<br> people that make 'em happen.<br> So far, everything he's said, we've<br> cross-checked, and it's proved legit.<br> And I think the money is persuasive.<br> That buy's a new life.<br> Do you think he might be<br> exaggerating his access?<br> Possibly.<br> But, al-Qaeda needs doctors, and<br> they are short-staffed, and...<br> that could explain his rise.<br> In six months to a year,<br> if he doesn't fuck up, he could<br> be called in to treat bin Laden.<br> At that moment, with 25 mill on the<br> table, I think he gives up the big man.<br> And if he doesn't, we kill him.<br> - John.<br> - Yeah.<br> When he arrives, let me set the<br> tone, and then I'll flip it to you,<br> and you can talk about asset protection.<br> - Roger that.<br> - Uh, Lauren,<br> I know you wanna get some questions in<br> there, but give Balawi a little time.<br> After John speaks, we'll cover<br> the basics, have his birthday cake,<br> then we'll get into the nitty-gritty.<br> Is that order okay? Or d-do<br> you wanna introduce everyone?<br> I'll introduce you,<br> you introduce your team.<br> - He knows this is a high-level meeting.<br> - Quick question.<br> All this taking place<br> inside our main building?<br> Right, and, uh, Lauren,<br> Washington will want...<br> real-time updates, so<br> please, stay on top of that.<br> Be concise, the director's in the loop.<br> And I wouldn't be surprised,<br> if he doesn't update the president.<br> Yeah, I'm on it.<br> Now, I just gotta get his ass down here.<br> Why are there gate guards there?<br> We talked about this, no one is supposed<br> to be there when my source arrives.<br> You might have spooked him already.<br> Well, procedures only work<br> if we follow them every time.<br> This is different. I'm sorry, I can't<br> explain, but it's for a good cause.<br> Look, I'm responsible for everybody's<br> safety, okay. It's not just about you.<br> I just need them to go away for a minute<br> You can search him as<br> soon as he gets here.<br> All stations, this is Whiplash.<br> Go ahead and stand down.<br> Copy that.<br> Thank you.<br> Okay, he's coming.<br> - We gonna search him when he gets here<br> - Sure.<br> Okay, let's go.<br> - Is he supposed to limp like that?<br> - Get your hand out of your pocket.<br> - Hey.<br> - "Allah hu Akbar. " (God is Great)<br> - Hey!<br> - Get your hand out of your pocket<br> - Do it now!<br> - "Allah hu Akbar. "<br> - Get your hand out of your poc...<br> - "Allah hu Akb... "<br> The CIA says, seven of<br> it's employees were killed,<br> and six others wounded, in a suicide<br> bombing in a base in Afghanistan.<br> It was one of the deadliest<br> attacks in CIA history.<br> The Associated Press has learned that...<br> the chief of the CIA's post in<br> the province, is among the victims.<br> Former officials say, she<br> was the mother of three.<br> The Taliban claimed<br> resposibility for the bombing...<br> - You okay?<br> - Mhm.<br> I, um, didn't think this<br> day could get any worse,<br> But, uh...<br> bad news from Saudi<br> intelligence. The, um...<br> courier guy, Abu Ahmed, is dead.<br> It's a detainee video.<br> He's dead.<br> In Afghanistan, 2001, I<br> buried him with my own hands.<br> He's dead. In Afghanistan, 2001...<br> And where was this?<br> Kabul.<br> No, I don't believe this.<br> I don't believe this.<br> Sorry, Maya.<br> I always liked this lead.<br> Sorry I just got here.<br> What are you going to do?<br> I'm gonna smoke everybody<br> involved in this op.<br> And then I'm gonna kill bin Laden.<br> Right.<br> Right.<br> I wanna make something absolutely clear.<br> If you thought there was some...<br> secret cell somewhere, working al-Qaeda,<br> well, I want you to<br> know that you're wrong.<br> This is it.<br> There's no working group<br> coming to the rescue.<br> There's nobody else hidden<br> away on some other floor.<br> There is just us.<br> And we are failing!<br> We're spending billions of dollars.<br> People are dying!<br> We are still no closer<br> to defeating our enemy.<br> They attacked us!<br> On land, in '98,<br> by sea in 2000, and from the air in 2001<br> They murdered 3,000 of our<br> citizens, in cold blood.<br> And they have slaughtered<br> our forward-deployed!<br> And what the fuck have<br> we done about it, huh?<br> What have we done?<br> We have twenty leadership names.<br> We've only eliminated four of them.<br> I want...<br> targets.<br> Do your fuckin' jobs,<br> bring me people to kill.<br> Hi, I painstakingly combed through<br> everything in the system and found this.<br> It's him.<br> He was one of ten names on a watch list<br> sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11.<br> Ibrahim Sayeed.<br> They told us to watch<br> out for him. Apparently,<br> they think his whole family and extended<br> family is bad, and has ties to KSM.<br> He was picked up for fake papers and a<br> doctored exit visa leaving Afghanistan,<br> traveling through Morocco, en route<br> to Kuwait. Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.<br> This must be Abu Ahmed.<br> Doesn't matter. God, I wish<br> I had that five years ago.<br> - How come I never saw it before?<br> - Nobody saw it, most likely.<br> There was a lot of<br> white noise after 9/11.<br> Countries wanting to help out.<br> We got a million tips, and...<br> you know, things got lost in the shuffle<br> Human error.<br> Anyway, I thought you<br> should know about it.<br> I just wanna say, I've<br> heard a lot about you.<br> You've inspired me to come to Pakistan.<br> Maybe you'd let me buy<br> you a kebab sometime.<br> Don't eat out.<br> It's too dangerous.<br> - Yup.<br> - Dan, Debbie found Abu Ahmed.<br> Really?<br> Yeah, he's been in the files this...<br> whole time. The family's name is Sayeed.<br> Okay, but he's, uh...<br> he's dead, so doesn't that make him<br> a little less interesting to you?<br> He may not be. We now know Abu<br> Ahmed is one of eight brothers.<br> All the brothers in the family look<br> alike. Three of them went to Afghanistan<br> Isn't it possible that when...<br> the three eldest brothers grew beards in<br> Afghanistan, they started to look alike?<br> I think the one calling himself<br> Abu Ahmed is still alive.<br> The picture we've been using is wrong.<br> It's of his older brother,<br> Habib. He's the one that's dead.<br> Okay, and what are you basing this on?<br> We have no intercepts<br> about Abu Ahmed dying.<br> We just have a detainee, who said he<br> buried a guy, who looked like Abu Ahmed.<br> But if someone as important<br> as Abu Ahmed had died,<br> they'd be talking about it online,<br> in chatrooms all over the place.<br> Plus, the detainee said<br> that Habib died in 2001.<br> We know Abu Ahmed was alive then,<br> trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar.<br> That means it's probably<br> one of the other brothers...<br> that's dead.<br> - In other words, you want it to be true<br> - Yes, I fucking want it to be true!<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down.<br> - Calm down.<br> - I am calm.<br> State your request.<br> Move heaven and earth.<br> And bring me this fucking<br> Sayeed family's phone number.<br> Okay, I'll go and talk to the Wolf.<br> - As-salam alaykum. (Peace be unto you)<br> - Wa-alaykum salam. (And unto you peace)<br> I need a couple of<br> hundred thousand bucks.<br> Four max.<br> - Where're you gonna get that?<br> - From you.<br> - You think so?<br> - Yeah.<br> This could crack open...<br> the facilitator Maya's been looking<br> for, by giving us a phone number.<br> She's your killer, Wolf,<br> you put her on the field.<br> Come on.<br> "Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem" (In the<br> name of God,most Gracious,most Merciful)<br> Allah rewards those that strive and<br> fight, over those that sit behind a desk<br> As you know, Abu Ghraib<br> and Gitmo fucked us.<br> The Detainee Program is now flypaper.<br> We got Senators jumping out of our asses<br> And the director is very concerned.<br> They will not stop<br> until they have a body.<br> I ran it.<br> I'll defend it.<br> Done.<br> I tell you what, man, it's<br> good to be back in Kuwait.<br> It's good to see you again.<br> Huh? It's been a while.<br> I need a favor.<br> Why I should help you?<br> Because we're friends.<br> You say we are friend.<br> How come you only call<br> me when you need help?<br> But when I need something, you<br> are too busy to pick up the phone.<br> - I don't think we are friends.<br> - All right, fair enough.<br> How about a V10 Lamborghini?<br> How's that for friendship?<br> Poor fucker had to get out of bed.<br> Hey.<br> - As-salam alaykum.<br> - Wa-alaykum salam.<br> - Thank you very much for this.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Appreciate it.<br> All right.<br> - Ooh, is this a Balboni?<br> - Yeah.<br> Fuck me dead.<br> It's nice, really nice.<br> What are you thinking?<br> Huh? Maybe a convertible? Get a<br> little bit of wind in the hair?<br> huh? Put the top down?<br> I think I will choose this one.<br> Give us a minute? Thank you.<br> That's a nice choice, my friend.<br> Speed yellow, go big or go home, huh?<br> Nice choice.<br> Sayeed.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Who do you think?<br> Guy's a terrorist.<br> His mother lives here.<br> I just need her phone number.<br> There will be no repercussions in Kuwait<br> I mean, somebody might die,<br> at some point, in Pakistan.<br> We got a deal?<br> Hey, Jack.<br> Sayeed family call in progress,<br> but you're not gonna like this.<br> The ground branch guys<br> are dragging their heels,<br> there's no team deployed right now.<br> Fuck.<br> He hasn't said anything incriminating,<br> but he's at the Rawal<br> call center in Rawalpindi.<br> Hey!<br> Why haven't you deployed a<br> team to stay in Rawalpindi?<br> For one thing, it's dangerous.<br> For another, the area is too<br> congested for us to be effective,<br> - without some predictive intelligence.<br> - Yeah, but that's why...<br> you should forward deploy, so<br> you can shorten the response time.<br> - It still wouldn't work.<br> - Why?<br> The guy never stays on<br> the phone long enough.<br> - You haven't tried.<br> - Look, I don't have the personnel.<br> - That's bullshit, man.<br> - Yeah?<br> As it is, my guys don't get any sleep,<br> tracking the threats within Pakistan.<br> Right, I understand.<br> But, you know, I don't really<br> care if your guys get sleep or not.<br> This guy you are obsessed with.<br> What's his name again?<br> Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti<br> is the nom de guerre.<br> His true name, we<br> think, is Ibrahim Sayeed.<br> Family lives in Kuwait. We've<br> been listening in on their calls.<br> Wasn't it,<br> like, eight brothers and a<br> million cousins that we know about?<br> - Anyone could be calling home.<br> - I know.<br> I mean, it's not like he's saying,<br> "Hey, Mom, it's me, the terrorist. "<br> Yeah, I know. But, look,<br> over the course of two months,<br> He's called from six different payphones<br> from two different cities,<br> never using the same phone twice.<br> And when his mother asked<br> him where he was, he lied.<br> He said that he was in a place in<br> the country with bad cell reception,<br> implying he was in the Tribals. When,<br> in fact, he was in a market in Peshawar.<br> I'm sorry but that's not normal<br> guy behavior, that's tradecraft.<br> Or maybe he just doesn't like his Mum.<br> Look, if he talks about an operation or<br> refers to anything remotely<br> fishy, I'll get on him, okay?<br> No, no, not okay, look.<br> Abu Ahmed is too smart to tip his<br> hand, by talking about ops on the phone.<br> He works for bin Laden.<br> The guys that talk about ops<br> on the phone don't get that job.<br> A lot of my friends have<br> died, trying to do this.<br> I believe I was spared,<br> so I could finish the job.<br> It is in surveillance video and pictures<br> like this of the explosive-laden vehicle<br> just moments before it was parked,<br> that police hope to find the man,<br> who wanted so badly last night, to<br> leave a body count in Times Square.<br> There are some people around the world,<br> that find our freedom so threatening,<br> that they're willing to<br> kill themselves and others,<br> to prevent us from enjoying it, but<br> we're not gonna let that happen...<br> Hey, I really need to talk to you...<br> about beefing up our surveillance<br> operation on the caller.<br> We don't have a surveillance<br> operation on the caller.<br> Someone just tried to blow up Times<br> Square and you're talking to me about...<br> some facilitator, who some<br> detainee, seven years ago, said,<br> - might have been working with al-Qaeda?<br> - He's the key to bin Laden.<br> I don't fucking care about bin<br> Laden, I care about the next attack.<br> You're gonna start working on<br> the American al-Qaeda cells.<br> Protect the homeland.<br> Bin Laden is the one who keeps<br> telling them to attack the homeland.<br> If it wasn't for him, al-Qaeda would<br> still be focused on overseas targets.<br> If you really wanna protect the<br> homeland, you need to get bin Laden.<br> This guy never met bin Laden.<br> This guy's a freelancer working<br> off the fucking internet.<br> No one's even talked to bin Laden<br> in four years. He's out of the game.<br> He may well even be dead. He<br> might as well be fucking dead.<br> But you know what you're doing?<br> You're chasing a ghost while the whole<br> fucking network grows all around you.<br> You just want me to nail some<br> low-level molar-cracker-doler,<br> so you can check that box<br> on your resume that says,<br> while you were in Pakistan,<br> you got a real terrorist.<br> But the truth is, you don't understand<br> Pakistan, and you don't know al-Qaeda!<br> Either give me the team I<br> need, to follow this lead,<br> or that other thing you're<br> gonna have on your resume,<br> is being the first station chief to be<br> called before Congressional Committee,<br> for subverting the efforts<br> to capture or kill bin Laden!<br> You're fucking out of your mind.<br> I need four techs and a<br> safe house in Rawalpindi.<br> Four techs and a safe house in Peshawar.<br> Either send them out,<br> or send me back to DC, and explain<br> to the director why you didn't.<br> I've been looking for you.<br> But more importantly,<br> he's been looking for you.<br> Yesterday, your caller<br> bought himself a cell phone.<br> And every time his phone rings,<br> this phone will ring.<br> Did I hook you up? Did I?<br> My guess is that he lives close<br> to where he's making the calls.<br> And it makes sense he'd<br> be living in Rawalpindi,<br> because there's an Al<br> Jazeera office there.<br> It'd be convenient for<br> him to drop the tapes off,<br> if he's messengering, either from<br> Bin Laden, or to an intermediary.<br> So, when he wants to make a call,<br> he leaves the house, walks a few<br> blocks, then switches on the phone.<br> We need to keep canvassing the<br> neighborhood until we find him.<br> We got a shooter.<br> We're blocked.<br> Let me talk to them.<br> They said whites faces don't belong here<br> If they don't move, shoot them.<br> He's still on?<br> - He's east of us, try the market.<br> - Okay, heading east.<br> Fuck.<br> We got a signal on Tipu<br> Road for ten minutes.<br> Then he went to Umar Road for 5 minutes,<br> NoGaza Road, Darya Abad,<br> that's in the Umar Road area.<br> In Rawalpindi,<br> Haider Road.<br> Roomi Road.<br> He went to the Convoy Road, which<br> is near the hospital, all right?<br> So that's Haider, Roomi<br> Road, Zahid, NoGaza, Taimur.<br> He made a call from Hapur<br> Street. That's the Spice District.<br> Lahore Street, which is also in Pesh<br> - 30 minutes.<br> Wazir Bagh Road - 5.<br> Nishtarabad - 5.<br> Phandu Road - 5 minutes.<br> The Grand Trunk Road - 45 seconds.<br> There's no pattern.<br> Sometimes, he calls every two<br> weeks, sometimes, every three.<br> There's no consistency.<br> I can't predict when he's gonna make<br> another call, 'cause the guy's erratic.<br> Meanwhile, our chief foreign<br> correspondent, Richard Engel confirms...<br> the CIA's top spy in Pakistan<br> has been pulled out of there.<br> He's been receiving death threats,<br> after being named publicly in a lawsuit,<br> by the family of a victim<br> of a US drone attack.<br> Richard Engel quotes a senior<br> intelligence official as saying,<br> the officer is returning to the US,<br> after the decision was made that...<br> terrorist threats against him, in<br> Pakistan, were of such a serious nature,<br> it would not be smart not to act.<br> ISI fucked you.<br> I'm so sorry, Joseph.<br> Still on tower three.<br> Signal getting stronger, 10...<br> Signal's getting weaker.<br> We lost him, no signal.<br> Heading south.<br> He's up at 5 again.<br> He's moving fast, he's in a vehicle.<br> Weaker now, he shifted. Go back to 5.<br> He's close by here, somewhere.<br> I don't get it.<br> He's driving in circles.<br> - No change?<br> - No.<br> Now let's hope he comes back around.<br> Okay, 15...<br> We're within ten meters of it.<br> Back to 40.<br> - He's here somewhere.<br> - Look at the cars.<br> Look at the cars, he's in a vehicle.<br> The guy with the phone in the white car.<br> You see him?<br> - Is that him?<br> - Could be.<br> - You got him?<br> - Got him.<br> Okay, breaking off.<br> The guy you've been looking for,<br> geolocated,<br> on his cell phone,<br> in his white car.<br> Thank you.<br> If you're right,<br> the whole world's gonna want in on this.<br> So, you gotta stick to your guns now.<br> Okay. No, it's great to speak to you too<br> I'm-I'm amazed that you're still here.<br> Well, I-I can do, um...<br> Let me have a look, um...<br> Why don't we say 1:30.<br> Yeah.<br> Uh, can you just hold the line, please?<br> I need a picket line along the G Highway, and men spaced at intervals...<br> - along the road, and at every exit.<br> - Maya, I know.<br> So, you agree with me<br> now, this is important.<br> No, I've just learned from my<br> predecessor, that life is better...<br> when I don't disagree with you.<br> Our current hypothesis is that he<br> lives somewhere along the highway,<br> in one of the towns, or a<br> medium-sized city called Abbottabad,<br> or up near Kashmir.<br> Kashmir is interesting because<br> it's a way station for the Tribals.<br> Abbottabad is interesting because we<br> know from detainee reporting that...<br> Abu Faraj stayed there, briefly, in 2003<br> The good news is he's<br> driving a white SUV.<br> SUVs are actually<br> pretty rare in Pakistan.<br> If he was driving a sedan<br> or a compact, we'd be fucked.<br> Obviously, this assumes<br> he doesn't change vehicles.<br> - Morning.<br> - Morning, Hamad.<br> "Yalla, yalla... "<br> Any American in Pakistan is a target.<br> They don't necessarily know I'm CIA.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> You're on a list.<br> Yeah.<br> And you, of all people, should<br> know that once you're on their list,<br> you never get off.<br> Next time, there may not be<br> bulletproof glass to save you.<br> We'll keep up on the<br> surveillance as best we can.<br> The high-res version, can<br> you get closer than that?<br> Yeah, well, you can up-res this image.<br> Even more?<br> Okay, that's good. Thank you.<br> I'll take that. Thank you very much.<br> - Take that too.<br> - You got it"ch".<br> ...to clean that audio as<br> well, just take the low one out.<br> Hey.<br> All right, so tell me<br> how I'm doing so far.<br> Basically, we had a guy who rolled<br> with al-Qaeda, and did services for him.<br> - Mm-hm.<br> - We lost him for seven years.<br> Now we find him again, and... boy,<br> does he have a really nice house.<br> - Is that it?<br> - Pretty much.<br> All right, let's go talk to the boss.<br> Oh, you, uh, you should sit back there.<br> - Sorry.<br> - No.<br> So they're gonna ask,<br> if bin Laden is at the<br> end of this rainbow.<br> Is the Pak military with him?<br> The question isn't: Are the<br> Paks protecting bin Laden?<br> The question is: Would he allow<br> himself to be protected by the Paks?<br> I mean, why would he trust<br> them? He tried to kill Musharraf.<br> - Hello.<br> - Sir.<br> All right, go ahead.<br> So a little context here, if you<br> take a right, out of Islamabad,<br> drive about forty-five minutes north,<br> you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad.<br> Now it's a mostly middle-class<br> community, some ex-military.<br> Not particularly interesting to us.<br> Except we did find this<br> compound, which is unique.<br> We got a 16-foot wall<br> around the entire perimeter.<br> The windows are blacked out.<br> There's even a 7-foot<br> privacy wall here, so,<br> even if we got up high, we<br> couldn't get a vantage point.<br> I mean it's-<br> it's a fortress.<br> Well, can't you put a camera somewhere?<br> In these trees here, maybe?<br> Get a look in the main house?<br> it would probably be discovered.<br> Well, we have to get a look<br> into the house, don't we?<br> All right.<br> What's this? This cluster<br> of buildings down here?<br> The PMA. It's the<br> Pakistani Military Academy.<br> It's their West Point.<br> And how close is that to the house?<br> About a mile.<br> to eight-tenths of a mile.<br> But who are you?<br> I'm the motherfucker that<br> found this place, sir.<br> Really?<br> All right, I wanna know more about who's<br> inside this house by the end of the week<br> Sir.<br> Motherfucker.<br> Good.<br> Morning, George.<br> It's been 21 days since we found<br> the house, nothing's happened.<br> Yeah.<br> Maya, it's Steve.<br> - Swing by, I wanna show you something.<br> - Okay.<br> Okay, you can leave it paused for now,<br> but we're gonna play through that...<br> Hey!<br> - Maya, come see.<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay, this is from a<br> few minutes ago, okay?<br> Yeah.<br> So remember, we've got two<br> males, two females and seven kids.<br> What's that?<br> Okay, I'm saying that's<br> Bushra, the brother's wife.<br> Whoa, whoa, how do you know the gender?<br> Well, look, this is a clothesline<br> right here for laundry.<br> Men don't mess with the wash.<br> Okay, now watch, it takes her about<br> four seconds to move from there,<br> to the front door, so<br> she's on the older side.<br> - What's that up there?<br> - Uh, those are kids, they're...<br> shuffling around, sword fighting<br> or something, with sticks.<br> You can see their height<br> relative to this. These are cows.<br> So, they're probably between 7 and 9.<br> - Boys, definitely.<br> - Wow, your female's moving fast.<br> Okay, that's what I wanted to<br> show you. Can we pause this please?<br> That's not the same lady.<br> That's female number three.<br> - So you found two males, three females.<br> - That's correct.<br> So, if there are three females,<br> there ought to be three males.<br> Observant Muslim women live with<br> their parents, or with their husbands.<br> We think there's a third<br> family, living in the house.<br> So, this third male that you've<br> identified as possibly being bin Laden,<br> do I give up all hope of ever<br> seeing a photograph of him?<br> Hope? Yeah.<br> You give up your hope, right now.<br> We scan for heat signatures,<br> but we can't validate if it's<br> a man or a woman up there.<br> We talked about burrowing a<br> pinhole camera, but there's a...<br> high risk of discovery.<br> We found a safe house,<br> but we can't get a vantage point to<br> fire a telescope over the balcony wall.<br> We have explored the possibility,<br> of digging tunnels, of<br> sending hot air balloons,<br> of rerouting supply C-130s to take a<br> peek, but that might be too alerting.<br> We've looked for ways of collecting<br> available DNA from his trash,<br> you know, looking for his<br> toothbrush, but they burn the trash.<br> We started a vaccination program,<br> sent a doctor to the house,<br> see if he could pull blood,<br> but that didn't work out.<br> We thought about sending<br> a guy with a bucket,<br> to pull a sample from the sewer,<br> to analyze his fecal matter.<br> What was wrong with that, exactly?<br> What was wrong with that? That, uh...<br> The sample would be too diluted.<br> And it's asking too much to get a voice<br> confirmation with him on the phone?<br> They don't make telephone<br> calls from the compound.<br> We pulled the cell tower nearby.<br> And I'm also going to give up hope that<br> he might ever get in that white SUV, and<br> drive around a bit and we could see him.<br> Don't they get groceries?<br> The unidentified third<br> male does not get groceries.<br> He does not leave the compound; he does<br> not present himself for photographs.<br> When he needs fresh air, he paces<br> around, beneath a grape arbor.<br> But the leaves are so thick,<br> they obscure our satellite views.<br> This is a professional<br> attempt to avoid detection.<br> Okay? Real tradecraft.<br> The only people we've seen...<br> behave in this way, are other<br> top-level al-Qaeda operatives.<br> We did a red team on your analysis.<br> According to them, this behavior could<br> belong to someone other than al-Qaeda.<br> They did give a 40 percent chance<br> that the unidentified third man...<br> is a senior al-Qaeda operative.<br> But they also said there's a 35<br> percent chance he's a Saudi drug dealer.<br> a Kuwaiti arms smuggler.<br> the relatives of the brothers.<br> Basically, we agree with you.<br> The house screams security.<br> It screams someone who wants<br> privacy; it even screams bad guy.<br> - But it does not scream bin Laden.<br> - You get the point?<br> If you can't prove it's bin Laden,<br> at least prove it's not someone else.<br> Like a drug dealer.<br> You know we lost the ability to prove<br> them when we lost the Detainee Program.<br> Who the hell am I supposed to ask? Huh?<br> Some guy in Gitmo who's all lawyered up?<br> He'll just tell his<br> lawyer to warn bin Laden.<br> You'll think of something.<br> He'd be the first successful drug<br> dealer never to have dealt drugs.<br> He has no internet access to the house;<br> he makes no phone calls either in or out<br> Who's he selling to? Who's he buying<br> from? How's he making his money?<br> And if you were to say, "He's retired,"<br> I'd say, "Where's the swimming pool?"<br> Where's the gold cage with the falcons?<br> And why does he send his courier...<br> to the two cities in Pakistan,<br> we most associate with al-Qaeda,<br> that have nothing particularly<br> to do with heroin production.<br> The president is a thoughtful,<br> analytical guy. He needs proof.<br> Go ahead, you guys.<br> I gotta say, your job...<br> - Hmm.<br> - Huh.<br> I just don't get the rhythms of politics<br> Oh, you think this is<br> political? If this was political,<br> we'd be having this conversation in<br> October, when there's an election bump.<br> This is pure risk, based on deductive<br> reasoning, inference, supposition,<br> and the only human reporting<br> you have is six years old,<br> from detainees, who were<br> questioned under duress.<br> The political move here is to<br> tell you to go fuck yourself,<br> and remind you, that I was in the room,<br> when your old boss pitched WMD Iraq.<br> At least, there, you<br> guys brought photographs.<br> You know, you're right, I agree<br> with everything you just said.<br> What I meant was, a man in your position<br> How do you evaluate the<br> risk of not doing something?<br> Hmm?<br> The risk of potentially letting<br> bin Laden slip through your fingers.<br> That is a fascinating question.<br> Hey.<br> I'm not saying we're gonna do it,<br> but the president wants to<br> know, if we were gonna act,<br> how would we do it?<br> Give us options.<br> Technically, these don't exist.<br> I actually tried to kill this<br> program a couple of times.<br> They've gone through, uh,<br> an initial round of testing,<br> and they have excellent radar defeat.<br> We just haven't tested<br> with people in them yet.<br> You'll notice these stealth panels,<br> similar to what we use on the B-2.<br> The rotors have been<br> muffled with decibel killers.<br> It's slower than a Black Hawk,<br> lacks the offense and the stability.<br> But, it can hide.<br> So, uh, e-excuse me, but what do we-what<br> do we need this for in-in Libya. I mean,<br> Gaddafi's anti-air is<br> virtually non-existent.<br> Maya, do you wanna brief them?<br> There are two narratives, about<br> the location of Osama bin Laden.<br> The one that you're most familiar with,<br> is that UBL is hiding in<br> a cave in the tribal areas.<br> That he's surrounded by a large<br> contingent of loyal fighters.<br> But that narrative, is<br> pre-9/11 understanding of UBL.<br> The second narrative, is<br> that he's living in a city.<br> Living in a city with multiple<br> points of egress and entry,<br> Access to communications, so that he<br> can keep in touch with the organization.<br> You can't run a global network of<br> interconnected cells from a cave.<br> We've located an individual, we<br> believe, based on detainee reporting,<br> is bin Laden's courier.<br> He's living in a house,<br> in Abbottabad, Pakistan.<br> And we assess,<br> that one of the other<br> occupants of the house,<br> is UBL.<br> General.<br> Excuse me.<br> Uh, so, UBL, you got-you got<br> an intel source on the ground?<br> - No.<br> - No?<br> Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden?<br> 'Cause the truth is, we've<br> been on this op before.<br> It was '07, and it wasn't bin<br> Laden, and we lost a couple of guys.<br> Totally understand.<br> Bin Laden uses a courier, to<br> interact with the outside world.<br> By locating the courier,<br> we've located bin Laden.<br> That's really the intel.<br> That's it?<br> Quite frankly, I didn't<br> even wanna use you guys.<br> With your dip and your velcro<br> and all your gear bullshit.<br> I wanted to drop a bomb.<br> But people didn't believe in<br> this lead enough to drop a bomb.<br> So, they're using you guys, as canaries,<br> in a theory that if bin Laden<br> isn't there, you can sneak away,<br> - and no one will be the wiser.<br> - Hmm.<br> But bin Laden, is there.<br> And you're gonna kill him for me.<br> They're nervous downtown.<br> I don't think we'll get an approval.<br> This decision is not going...<br> It's her against the world.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I'm about to go look<br> the president in the eye.<br> And what I'd like to<br> know, no fucking bullshit,<br> is where everyone stands on this thing.<br> Now, very simply, is he there,<br> or is he not fucking there?<br> We all come at this, through the<br> filter of our own past experiences.<br> Now I remember Iraq WMD,<br> very clearly. I fronted that.<br> And I can tell you the case for that,<br> was much stronger than this case.<br> A fucking "yes" or a "no".<br> We don't deal in certainty,<br> we deal in probability.<br> And I'd say there's a 60<br> percent probability he's there.<br> I concur, 60 percent.<br> I'm at 80 percent, their<br> OPSEC is what convinces me.<br> - You guys ever agree on anything?<br> - Well, I agree with Mike.<br> We're basing this mostly<br> on detainee reporting,<br> and I spent a bunch of time in those<br> rooms. I'd say it's a soft 60, sir.<br> I'm virtually certain there's<br> some high value target there,<br> I'm just not sure it's bin Laden.<br> Well, this is a little bit<br> of a cluster fuck, isn't it?<br> I'd like to know what Maya thinks.<br> We're all incorporating<br> her assessment into ours.<br> A hundred percent he's there.<br> Okay, fine, 95 percent 'cause I<br> know certainty freaks you guys out,<br> but it's a hundred.<br> They're all cowed.<br> - What do you think of the girl?<br> - I think she's fucking smart.<br> We're all smart, Jeremy.<br> May I join you?<br> How is the food down here anyway?<br> Uh, it's okay.<br> - How long have you worked for the CIA?<br> - Twelve years.<br> - I was recruited out of high school.<br> - And do you know why we did that?<br> I don't think I can answer that<br> question, sir. I don't think I'm...<br> allowed to... answer.<br> All right.<br> What else have you done<br> for us, besides bin Laden?<br> Nothing.<br> I've done nothing else.<br> Well, you certainly have a flair for it.<br> No?<br> Yeah.<br> All right, let's be serious now.<br> Yeah don't fuck around on this one, dude<br> You're just fuckin' around,<br> 'cause you see I'm up by two games.<br> How many you got?<br> Patrick, be honest with me.<br> You really believe this story?<br> I mean, no offense, no<br> offense, I know, but,<br> Osama bin Laden?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What part convinced you?<br> Her confidence.<br> That's the kinda, concrete<br> data point I'm looking for.<br> I tell you, buddy.<br> Her confidence is the one thing...<br> that's keeping me from getting<br> ass-raped in some Pakistani prison.<br> I'm gonna be honest with you, bro.<br> I'm cool with it.<br> Yeah.<br> Maya, I wanted you to hear it first.<br> You know that thing we talked about?<br> It's gonna happen.<br> - When?<br> - Tonight.<br> Good luck.<br> - Fifty bucks?<br> - Fifty bucks.<br> - Fifty bucks?<br> - Representing.<br> Fifty bucks.<br> It's a lucky shot.<br> Fuck.<br> Go.<br> Copy.<br> Copy that.<br> Thirty seconds to first turn.<br> Hey, Justin, what're you listening to?<br> - Tony Robbins.<br> - Tony Robbins, really?<br> You should listen to it.<br> I got plans for after this.<br> Big time. I wanna talk<br> to all of you about it.<br> Who here's been in a helo crash before?<br> OK, then we're all good.<br> We've just crossed the<br> border, now entering Pakistan.<br> Pakistani comms, no chatter.<br> Three minutes, stand by for doors open.<br> Two minutes.<br> Should be coming up just<br> off our nose, eleven o'clock.<br> Eyes on target.<br> Stay tight.<br> Three seconds.<br> Hey! Slide right! Slide right!<br> Too much updraft! Now, hurry up!<br> - We've lost power<br> - Go to lock-out.<br> Hey!<br> Hard landing!<br> Prince Five-One is down.<br> Black Hawk down in the animal pen.<br> This way!<br> This mission is still a<br> "go", I repeat, we are a "go".<br> Alpha Team is in the animal<br> pen, making entry for AC1.<br> No ropes, wheels down.<br> Prayer room's clear.<br> Breacher!<br> Echo Team is away, Prince<br> Five-Two exiting Alpha-Oscar.<br> Three...<br> Two...<br> One...<br> Execute!<br> Ibrahim!<br> C'mon out!<br> "Erfa Edak!"
