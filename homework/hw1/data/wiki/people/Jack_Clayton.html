<p><b>Jack Clayton</b> (1 March 1921 – 26 February 1995) was a British film director, who specialised in bringing literary works to the screen.</p>
<p>Starting out as a teenage studio "tea boy" in 1935, Clayton worked his way up through British film industry in a career that spanned nearly 60 years. He rapidly rose through a series of increasingly important roles in British film production, before shooting to international prominence as a director with his Oscar-winning feature film debut, the landmark 1959 drama <i><a href="/wiki/Room_at_the_Top_(1959_film)" title="Room at the Top (1959 film)">Room at the Top</a></i>.</p>
<p>Clayton looked set for a brilliant future, and he was highly regarded by peers and critics alike, but a number of overlapping factors hampered his career. He was a notably 'choosy' director, who by his own admission "never made a film I didn't want to make", and he repeatedly turned down films (including <i><a href="/wiki/Alien_(film)" title="Alien (film)">Alien</a></i>) that became huge hits for other directors. But he was also dogged by bad luck and bad timing - the Hollywood studios labelled him as 'difficult', and studio politics quashed a string of planned films in the 1970s, which were either taken out of his hands, or cancelled in the final stages of preparation. In 1977 he suffered a double blow - his current film was cancelled just two weeks before shooting was due to begin, and a few months later he suffered a serious stroke which robbed him of the ability to speak, and put his career on hold for five years.</p>
<p>Although Clayton worked almost constantly on a wide range of significant projects during his years as a director, most either never made it into production, or wound up being made by other directors, and he was only able to complete seven feature films before his death in 1995. However, despite this relatively small <i>oeuvre</i>, the films of Jack Clayton continue to be appreciated, and both they and their director have been widely admired and praised by leading film critics like <a href="/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, and by film industry peers including <a href="/wiki/Harold_Pinter" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro" title="Guillermo del Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="François Truffaut">François Truffaut</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>.</p>

<p>During the war years Clayton worked on many notable British features, including the first British Technicolor film <i><a href="/wiki/Wings_of_the_Morning_(film)" title="Wings of the Morning (film)">Wings of the Morning</a></i> (1937), and worked with visiting American directors, including <a href="/wiki/Thornton_Freeland" title="Thornton Freeland">Thornton Freeland</a> on <i><a href="/wiki/Over_the_Moon_(film)" title="Over the Moon (film)">Over the Moon</a></i> (1939) and <a href="/wiki/Tim_Whelan" title="Tim Whelan">Tim Whelan</a> on <i><a href="/wiki/Q_Planes" title="Q Planes">Q Planes</a></i> (1939).

<p>While in service with the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> film unit during World War II, Clayton shot his first film, the documentary <i>Naples is a Battlefield</i> (1944), representing the problems in the reconstruction of <a href="/wiki/Naples" title="Naples">Naples</a>, the first great city liberated in World War II, ruined after Allied bombing and destruction caused by the retreating Nazis.

It was during the making of <i>Moulin Rouge</i> that Clayton met his second wife, French actress Katherine Kath (born Lilly Faess), who portrayed legendary <a href="/wiki/Can-can" title="Can-can">can-can</a> dancer "<a href="/wiki/La_Goulue" title="La Goulue">La Goulue</a>" in the film; they married in 1953, following Clayton's divorce from Norden, but the marriage was short-lived. It was also during this period that Clayton first met rising British star <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Harvey" title="Laurence Harvey">Laurence Harvey</a>, with whom he worked on both <i><a href="/wiki/The_Good_Die_Young" title="The Good Die Young">The Good Die Young</a></i> (1954) and <i><a href="/wiki/I_Am_a_Camera_(film)" title="I Am a Camera (film)">I Am a Camera</a></i> (1955).</p>

<p>In 1959, with funding from Romulus FIlms, Clayton directed his first full-length feature, a gritty contemporary social drama adapted from the novel by <a href="/wiki/John_Braine" title="John Braine">John Braine</a>. Although it was the first and only occasion on which Clayton took over a project from another director (in this case <a href="/wiki/Peter_Glenville" title="Peter Glenville">Peter Glenville</a>), <i><a href="/wiki/Room_at_the_Top_(1959_film)" title="Room at the Top (1959 film)">Room at the Top</a></i> (1959) was a huge hit both critically and commercially, and it was one of the first British films to benefit from wide distribution in the USA. It established Clayton as one of the leading directors of his day, made an international star of lead actor <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Harvey" title="Laurence Harvey">Laurence Harvey</a>, won a slew of awards at major film festivals, and was nominated for six Oscars (including Best Director), with <a href="/wiki/Simone_Signoret" title="Simone Signoret">Simone Signoret</a> winning Best Actress, and scriptwriter <a href="/wiki/Neil_Paterson_(writer)" title="Neil Paterson (writer)">Neil Paterson</a> winning for Best Writing, Screenplay (Based on Material from Another Medium). A harsh indictment of the British <a href="/wiki/Class_system" title="Class system" class="mw-redirect">class system</a> that has been credited with spearheading Britain's movement toward <a href="/wiki/Realism_(arts)" title="Realism (arts)">realism</a> in films, it inaugurated a series of realist films known as the <a href="/wiki/British_New_Wave" title="British New Wave">British New Wave</a>, which featured, for that time, unusually sincere treatments of sexual mores, and introduced a new maturity into British cinema, breaking new ground as the first British feature film to openly discuss sex.</p>
<p>Following the success of his feature debut, Clayton was offered many prestige projects, but he rejected all of them, later commenting that he felt that they were "carbon copies" of <i>Room At The Top</i>. Among the titles he turned down (according biographer Neil Sinyard) were <i><a href="/wiki/Sons_and_Lovers_(1960_film)" title="Sons and Lovers (1960 film)">Sons and Lovers</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Jack_Cardiff" title="Jack Cardiff">Jack Cardiff</a>), <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_and_Sunday_Morning_(film)" title="Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Karel_Reisz" title="Karel Reisz">Karel Reisz</a>) and <i><a href="/wiki/The_L-Shaped_Room" title="The L-Shaped Room">The L-Shaped Room</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Bryan_Forbes" title="Bryan Forbes">Bryan Forbes</a>), all of which became major hits for their respective directors. An alternate interpretation was offered by film editor <a href="/wiki/Jim_Clark_(film_editor)" title="Jim Clark (film editor)">Jim Clark</a>, who would work with Clayton on his next two films - he claimed that "Clayton's inability to make a decision was legendary" and that this was why he took so long to decide on his next film.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Innocents_.281961.29"><i>The Innocents</i> (1961)</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Jack_Clayton&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: The Innocents (1961)">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Setting a pattern that continued through the rest of his career, Clayton took a completely different tack with his second feature, on which he was both producer and director. The period ghost story <i><a href="/wiki/The_Innocents_(1961_film)" title="The Innocents (1961 film)">The Innocents</a></i> (1961) was adapted by <a href="/wiki/Truman_Capote" title="Truman Capote">Truman Capote</a> from the classic <a href="/wiki/Henry_James" title="Henry James">Henry James</a> short story <i><a href="/wiki/The_Turn_of_the_Screw" title="The Turn of the Screw">The Turn of the Screw</a></i>, which Clayton had first read when he was 10. By a fortunate coincidence, Clayton was contracted to make another film for 20th Century Fox, as was actress <a href="/wiki/Deborah_Kerr" title="Deborah Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a>, whom Clayton had long admired, so he was able to cast Kerr in the lead role as Miss Giddens, a repressed spinster who takes a job in a large, remote English country house; there working as the governess to an orphaned brother and sister, Giddens gradually comes to believe that her young charges are possessed by evil spirits.</p>
<p>The film has consistently received high praise on many counts - Kerr's superb performance, which is often rated as one of the best of her career; the powerfully unsettling performances of the two juvenile leads, <a href="/wiki/Martin_Stephens" title="Martin Stephens">Martin Stephens</a> (Miles) and <a href="/wiki/Pamela_Franklin" title="Pamela Franklin">Pamela Franklin</a> (Flora); the eerie score by renowned French composer <a href="/wiki/Georges_Auric" title="Georges Auric">Georges Auric</a>; and especially the lush black-and-white widescreen cinematography of <a href="/wiki/Freddie_Francis" title="Freddie Francis">Freddie Francis</a>. Although Clayton was initially dismayed at Fox's insistence that the film be shot in <a href="/wiki/CinemaScope" title="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a> (a format he greatly disliked) Francis was able to use it to great advantage, carefully framing each scene, and using innovative techniques, such as placing protagonists at the extreme opposite edges of the screen during dialogue scenes, or focussing on the central region while using specially-made filters to blur the edges of the frame, creating a subtle but disturbing sense of unease in the viewer. Capote's screenplay (with uncredited contributions from <a href="/wiki/John_Mortimer" title="John Mortimer">John Mortimer</a>) was mainly adapted from <a href="/wiki/William_Archibald" title="William Archibald">William Archibald</a>'s stage version of the story.</p>
<p>Although it was not a major commercial hit, it earned strongly positive reviews on release and its reputation has grown steadily over the years. <a href="/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a> praised it as "one of the most elegantly beautiful ghost movies ever made", and on its release, veteran <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Express" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a></i> reviewer <a href="/w/index.php?title=Leonard_Mosely&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Leonard Mosely (page does not exist)">Leonard Mosely</a> raved: "It is at least 20 years since I sat in a cinema and felt the skin crawling on the back of my head through sheer nervous tension, but I felt that creepy sensation once more this week. I was terrified by a film in which no blood is visibly shed and no graves are dug up." Both Francis and Capote subsequently rated their work on the film as the best of their respective screen careers, and it has been widely acclaimed as a classic of psychological horror by many leading directors. <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="François Truffaut">François Truffaut</a>, on spotting Clayton in a restaurant, famously sent him a note, scribbled on a napkin, which read, "<i>The Innocents</i> is the best English film after Hitchcock goes to America.".<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

A psycho-sexual drama, set in contemporary London, it examined a marriage in crisis, with <a href="/wiki/Anne_Bancroft" title="Anne Bancroft">Anne Bancroft</a> starring as an affluent middle-aged woman who becomes estranged from her unfaithful and emotionally distant husband, a successful author (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Finch" title="Peter Finch">Peter Finch</a>).

Despite critical praise, the film failed to connect with audiences, and Clayton later expressed the view that, like several other of his projects, the film was a victim of "bad timing".</p>
<p>Although film editor Jim Clark recalled the production as a largely happy experience, it marked the end of his working relationship with Clayton. After a screening at Cannes, Clayton decided to cut five minutes from the film and although Clark objected, Clayton eventually took most of the footage from the pivotal scene in which Anne Bancroft's character has a breakdown in the middle of <a href="/wiki/Harrods" title="Harrods">Harrods</a>. Clark privately confided his misgivings to Clayton's assistant Jeanie Sims, but later suspected that Sims might have told Clayton, because after Clark had started work on his next movie he received a vitriolic letter, apparently from Clayton, who blamed Clark for the failure of the film, and claimed that he had "never been behind the project" - although Clark suspected the letter might not have been written by Clayton at all, since it was typed and Clayton "never used a typewriter".<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The sets and costumes and most of the performances are exceptionally good, but the movie itself is as lifeless as a body that's been too long at the bottom of a swimming pool."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Canby was also critical of the casting of Robert Redford, ("hardly an ideal choice") and concluded his review by dismissing the film as "frivolous without being much fun".<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Critics also targeted a supposed lack of 'chemistry' between its two leads, a view no doubt fuelled by comments from Farrow herself, who subsequently revealed that she found it hard to establish a rapport with her co-star, who was obsessed with the unfolding real-life drama of the <a href="/wiki/Watergate_scandal" title="Watergate scandal">Watergate scandal</a> and who, when not on camera, spent nearly all his time in his trailer, watching the coverage of the Watergate hearings on TV.</p>
<p>Ironically, in spite of the poor reviews, the movie did good business at the box office and became one of Clayton's most commercially successful films, taking over $26 million against its budget of $6.5 million. It also fared well in major industry awards, winning two Oscars that year (Best Costume Design for Theoni V.

<p>Clayton returned to directing in 1982, after a five-year hiatus forced on him by his 1977 stroke. His new film was another dream project that originated more than twenty years earlier, but which he had previously been unable to realize. Even before it came into Clayton's hands, the <a href="/wiki/Something_Wicked_This_Way_Comes_(film)" title="Something Wicked This Way Comes (film)">film version</a> of <a href="/wiki/Ray_Bradbury" title="Ray Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Something_Wicked_This_Way_Comes_(novel)" title="Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)">Something Wicked This Way Comes</a></i> had a chequered history. Bradbury wrote the original short story in 1948, and in 1957 (reportedly after seeing <i><a href="/wiki/Singing_In_The_Rain" title="Singing In The Rain" class="mw-redirect">Singing In The Rain</a></i> some 40 times) Bradbury adapted it into a 70-page screen treatment and presented it as a gift to <a href="/wiki/Gene_Kelly" title="Gene Kelly">Gene Kelly</a>. Clayton evidently met Bradbury ca. 1959 and expressed interest in directing the film, but Kelly was unable to raise the money to produce it, so Bradbury subsequently expanded the treatment into the novel version of the story, which was published in 1962.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to a 1983 <i>New York Times</i> interview with Bradbury, he and Clayton reconnected and revived the project thanks to a pair of coincidental meetings. In 1969, while walking through <a href="/wiki/Beverly_Hills" title="Beverly Hills" class="mw-redirect">Beverly Hills</a>, Bradbury met <a href="/wiki/Peter_Douglas" title="Peter Douglas">Peter Douglas</a> (the son of actor <a href="/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>), who was hoping to become a movie producer; he asked Bradbury if he had any suitable screenplays, so Bradbury suggested "Something Wicked". Coincidentally, Clayton was having lunch with Kirk Douglas on the very same day, and when Douglas asked the director about films he might like to make, Clayton also mentioned <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>. Peter and Kirk Douglas then optioned the rights to the book, and Bradbury spent five months editing down his unwieldy 240-page script to a more feasible 120 pages. As noted above, the script was approved for production by Paramount, but at this point it fell foul of the power struggle between Paramount head of production, <a href="/wiki/David_Picker" title="David Picker" class="mw-redirect">David Picker</a> and the studio's new president <a href="/wiki/Barry_Diller" title="Barry Diller">Barry Diller</a>. According to Bradbury's account, Picker loved the script, but Diller "hated anything Picker loved" so he ordered the production to be shut down.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Clayton later admitted that he was so enraged by Diller's decision that he put his fist through a Paramount office window.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>in the early 1980s, after Clayton had recovered from his stroke, Peter Douglas was able to sell the project to the Disney studios, with Clayton again signed to direct. Unfortunately, the film was fraught with problems throughout its production. Clayton and Bradbury reportedly fell out after the director brought in British writer <a href="/wiki/John_Mortimer" title="John Mortimer">John Mortimer</a> to do an uncredited rewrite of the screenplay. Clayton made the film as a dark thriller, which saw him to return to themes he had explored in earlier films - the supernatural, and the exposure of children to evil. However, when he submitted his original cut, the studio expressed strong reservations about its length and pacing, and its commercial potential, and Disney then took the unusual step of holding the film back from release for almost a year. Clayton was reportedly sidelined (although he retained his director credit) and Disney spent an additional six months, and some $5 million overhauling it, making numerous cuts and removing the original score (to make it more 'family-friendly'), and shooting new scenes (in some of which, because of the long delay caused by the reshoots, the two child stars were noticeably older and taller).</p>
<p>The version of the film that hit the screens in 1983 was a compromise between Disney's insistence on a commercial film with 'family' appeal, and Clayton's original, darker vision of the story. To reduce costs, original editor Argyle Nelson Jr was fired, and assistant editor Barry Gordon was promoted to replace him (resulting in the film's dual editor credit). Gordon was given the task of re-editing the film, and at Disney's insistence, he was obliged to remove some of Clayton's completed scenes. The most prominent casualty was the pioneering <a href="/wiki/Computer_animation" title="Computer animation">computer-generated animation</a> sequence that was to have opened the film, which depicted the empty train bearing Dark's Carnival arriving in the town and magically unfolding itself into place. The much-heralded sequence (which was discussed in detail in a 1982 edition of <i><a href="/wiki/Cinefantastique" title="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a></i>) would have been the first significant use of the new technology in a major Hollywood movie, but it was almost entirely deleted, and in the final cut, only one brief CGI shot was retained. Another Clayton sequence that was removed featured a giant disembodied hand that reached into the boys' room and tried to grab them - this was deleted by the studio on the grounds that the mechanical effect was not realistic enough, and it was replaced with a newly filmed sequence in which the boys' room is invaded by spiders. (In 2012, co-star Shawn Carson recalled the harrowing experience of having to film the new scene, which was entirely done using real, live spiders). Bradbury was asked to write new opening narration (read by <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Hill_(actor)" title="Arthur Hill (actor)">Arthur Hill</a>) to help clarify the story, and new special effects were inserted, including the "cloud tank" storm effects.</p>
<p>Another major disappointment for both Clayton and his musical collaborator, Georges Delerue was the loss of the original score, which Disney rejected as being 'too dark' - it was removed at the studio's insistence, and replaced by a new score, written by American composer <a href="/wiki/James_Horner" title="James Horner">James Horner</a>. Delerue's soundtrack (which the composer considered the best of the music he wrote for Hollywood films) remained unheard in the Disney vaults until 2011, when the studio unusually gave permission for the French Universal label to issue 30 minutes of excerpts from the original 63 minutes of studio recordings on a limited edition CD (coupled with excerpts from another unused Delerue score, for <a href="/wiki/Mike_Nichols" title="Mike Nichols">Mike Nichols</a>' <i><a href="/wiki/Regarding_Henry" title="Regarding Henry">Regarding Henry</a></i>).</p>

<p>Despite his high critical standing, Clayton encountered repeated career setbacks after the release of <i>Our Mother's House</i> and over the 15 years between the release of <i>Our Mother's House</i> and <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, he was only able to complete one feature as a director, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, in 1974. One reason was Clayton's own perfectionism as a filmmaker; he was known for his discernment and taste, his painstaking and meticulous approach to his work, and his desire not to repeat himself, and in his biographer's words, Clayton "never made a film he did not want to make".<sup id="cite_ref-Neil_Sinyard_2000_p.207_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Neil_Sinyard_2000_p.207-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Consequently, he rejected many notable films in the wake of <i>Room At The Top</i>.

<p>Clayton's output was also compromised by the inherent riskiness of the film business. As his biographer Neil Sinyard elucidates, Clayton worked intensively on many projects throughout his directing career, but for various reasons most never came to fruition. Among the projects that Clayton was never able to bring to the screen, or which were eventually made by other directors, were:</p>
<ul>

Richler's biographer Reinhold Kramer suggested that the real problem was that Clayton was unable to raise enough money to get the movie into production, but Neil Sinyard asserts that Columbia cancelled the film after Clayton refused to accede to changes the studio had ordered to Richter's script, and he and Richeler resigned from the production. Clayton himself also opined (in a letter to Le Carré) that he suspected that Columbia was short of money after the expensive failure of <i><a href="/wiki/Casino_Royale_(1967_film)" title="Casino Royale (1967 film)">Casino Royale</a></i>, and that the studio had bought the rights to the novel without realising that it was "not James Bond". The project was eventually revived under director <a href="/wiki/Frank_R._Pierson" title="Frank R. Pierson" class="mw-redirect">Frank R. Pierson</a>, who jettisoned Richler's screenplay and made the film from his own adapted script, although that proved to be a critical and commercial flop.</li>
<li><i>Zaharoff, Pedlar of Death</i> (1969) was one of Clayton's most cherished projects, a biopic about the notorious early 20th century arms dealer and political manipulator <a href="/wiki/Basil_Zaharoff" title="Basil Zaharoff">Basil Zaharoff</a>. It was originally slated to be made for Universal, and Clayton reportedly did an enormous amount of research for it, but it was never given approval. He tried to revive the project twice more, in 1978 and 1990, but was never able to get it made.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/The_Tenant" title="The Tenant">The Tenant</a></i> (1969–75) - Clayton was originally attached to make a film adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Roland_Topor" title="Roland Topor">Roland Topor</a>'s psychological horror novel for Universal ca. 1970, but this project never made it into production. He revived it while working for Paramount in the early 1970s, intending to make it after <i>The Great Gatbsy</i>, but to Clayton's great chagrin studio head <a href="/wiki/Barry_Diller" title="Barry Diller">Barry Diller</a> wrongly assumed Clayton had lost interest in the film and gave it to <a href="/wiki/Roman_Polanski" title="Roman Polanski">Roman Polanski</a>, without consulting Clayton. When he discovered this, Clayton phoned Diller and excoriated him for taking away a project that had been acquired specifically for him, and giving it to another director without his knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another complicating factor in Clayton's career was that several film projects were cancelled without warning when pre-production was well advanced - in one case, just two weeks before shooting was to have started. Neil Sinyard nominates three major projects, <i>Casualties of War</i>, <i>Fall Creek</i>, and <i>Silence</i>, the successive failures of which reportedly devastated Clayton, and Clayton himself later opined that these setbacks contributed to his subsequent health problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Casualties_of_War" title="Casualties of War">Casualties of War</a></i> (Paramount, 1970) was a controversial Vietnam War drama, based on a true story by Daniel Lang, published in <i>The New Yorker</i> in 1969. The story concerns four American soldiers who are charged with the rape and murder of a young Vietnamese woman after one of their comrades (who had refused to take part in the crime) informs on them. An early script by Peter Hammill was rejected, and many leading writers were considered for the project, before novice screenwriter <a href="/wiki/David_Giler" title="David Giler">David Giler</a> submitted a first-draft script that Clayton deemed "magnificent". According to Neil Sinyard, Paramount cancelled the film at the behest of <a href="/wiki/The_Pentagon" title="The Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>, who feared that it might erode public support for the war effort. It was eventually made for Columbia by <a href="/wiki/Brian_De_Palma" title="Brian De Palma">Brian De Palma</a> in 1989, with <a href="/wiki/Michael_J._Fox" title="Michael J. Fox">Michael J. Fox</a> in the lead role.</li>
<li><i>Fall Creek</i> (1976), another collaboration with producer <a href="/wiki/David_Merrick" title="David Merrick">David Merrick</a>, <i>Fall Creek</i> was a 'revisionist' look at the American frontier, in a similar vein to contemporary "new wave westerns" like <i><a href="/wiki/Little_Big_Man_(film)" title="Little Big Man (film)">Little Big Man</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/McCabe_%26_Mrs._Miller" title="McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller">McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</a></i>. The script by <a href="/wiki/Larry_McMurtry" title="Larry McMurtry">Larry McMurtry</a> was adapted from the novel by <a href="/wiki/Jessamyn_West_(writer)" title="Jessamyn West (writer)">Jessamyn West</a>, and dealt with a notorious 1824 massacre of native Americans in Indiana, and the racial and political crisis that followed. The project was originally conceived with <a href="/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a> as the star, but he turned it down. Larry McMurtry discusses the production in his book <i>Hollywood: A Third Memoir</i>, calling the screenplay "one of my better early scripts" and describing Clayton as "much the most fun" of any director he worked with. According to McMurtry, the project collapsed after David Merrick (ominously) suffered a stroke that left him permanently confined to a wheelchair.<sup id="cite_ref-Larry_McMurtry_2010_pp.109-112_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Larry_McMurtry_2010_pp.109-112-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Its cancellation was a bitter blow for Clayton, who was an ardent fan of the genre, and had long hoped to direct a western.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li><i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Silence_(1977_film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Silence (1977 film) (page does not exist)">Silence</a></i> (Fox, 1977) was a contemporary urban thriller about racial tensions, based on the <a href="/wiki/James_Kennaway" title="James Kennaway">James Kennaway</a> novel about a white man who escapes from a pursuing black gang by hiding out in the apartment of a mute African-American woman. The film was reportedly cancelled just two weeks before filming was scheduled to start, and according to Sinyard this was a devastating blow to Clayton. In a curious turn of events, Hollywood executive <a href="/wiki/Barry_Diller" title="Barry Diller">Barry Diller</a> was responsible for the demise three of the films Clayton planned to make in the 1970s. In 1970 Clayton's film adaptation of Ray Bradbury's <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i> fell foul of a power struggle between Diller (who had just been appointed President of Paramount Pictures) and Paramount's head of production <a href="/wiki/David_Picker" title="David Picker" class="mw-redirect">David Picker</a>, and Diller cancelling the project. Five years later, Diller took <i>The Tenant</i> from Clayton without consulting him, and gave it to Roman Polanski. Finally, in 1977, <i>Silence</i> was cancelled just two weeks before it was due to go into production - ironically, again by Diller, who had recently left Paramount to become the head of <a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1977, as compensation for the cancellation of <i>Silence</i>, Fox offered Clayton the chance to a new science fiction script co-credited to David Giler and <a href="/wiki/Dan_O%27Bannon" title="Dan O'Bannon">Dan O'Bannon</a>, but Clayton turned down the film (<i><a href="/wiki/Alien_(film)" title="Alien (film)">Alien</a></i>), and it was ultimately given to <a href="/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Ridley Scott">Ridley Scott</a> who, like Sydney Pollack before him, scored a career-making hit. A few months later, Clayton suffered a major stroke which robbed him of the ability to speak. He was helped to recover by his wife Haya, and a group of close friends, but he later revealed that he deliberately kept his condition secret because he feared he might not get work again if his affliction became known.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> He did not commit to another assignment for five years.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Bourne Identity</i> (1983) - after completing <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, Clayton was hired to direct a film adaptation of Robert Ludlum's best-selling espionage thriller, which was to have starred <a href="/wiki/Burt_Reynolds" title="Burt Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a> as Jason Bourne. Clayton had met Reynolds several years earlier, while working with Reynolds' then partner <a href="/wiki/Sally_Field" title="Sally Field">Sally Field</a> on another unrealised project, and Clayton felt that Reynolds was a star whose acting potential had not been fully explored. Unfortunately, the production was repeatedly postponed due to location issues and problems with Reynolds' schedule, and it went into "development hell" for almost 20 years before finally being made into the hit version with <a href="/wiki/Matt_Damon" title="Matt Damon">Matt Damon</a> (which bore little resemblance to Ludlum's novel).</li>
</ul>

<p>When asked his religion, he replied: "ex-Catholic". Clayton was married three times, his first was to British actress <a href="/wiki/Christine_Norden" title="Christine Norden">Christine Norden</a> in 1947, but they divorced in 1953; the same year he married again to French actress Katherine Kath, but this was short-lived. His third marriage, (some time in the mid-1960s) was to the Israeli actress <a href="/wiki/Haya_Harareet" title="Haya Harareet">Haya Harareet</a>, and this lasted until his death. Clayton died in hospital in Slough, England from a heart attack, following a short illness, on 25 February 1995.</p>
<p>On the first anniversary of Clayton's death, BAFTA held a ceremony to celebrate his life and career, which featured a screening of <i>The Bespoke Overcoat</i> and a solo flute performance from Delerue's score for <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, which was a favourite of Clayton's wife Haya. Tributes were delivered by Sir John Woolf, Harold Pinter, <a href="/wiki/Karel_Reisz" title="Karel Reisz">Karel Reisz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freddie_Francis" title="Freddie Francis">Freddie Francis</a>, Clayton's editor <a href="/wiki/Terry_Rawlings" title="Terry Rawlings">Terry Rawlings</a>, his agent Robert Shapiro, and actors <a href="/wiki/Sam_Waterston" title="Sam Waterston">Sam Waterston</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scott_Wilson_(actor)" title="Scott Wilson (actor)">Scott Wilson</a>, with whom he had worked on <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. In his professional tribute to Clayton, <a href="/wiki/Harold_Pinter" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a> said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Jack Clayton was a director of great sensitivity, intelligence and flair. He was a gentle man, with a quiet, wry sense of humour, but professionally he possessed the utmost rigour and a fierce determination. I wrote the screenplay of <i>The Pumpkin Eater</i> in 1963. It remains, in my view, a film of considerable power and, of course, absolute integrity."<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Former colleague <a href="/wiki/Jim_Clark_(film_editor)" title="Jim Clark (film editor)">Jim Clark</a> was given his major break by Clayton, who hired him as the editor on <i>The Innocents</i>. They became close friends (and regular drinking partners) during the making of film. In his 2010 memoir <i>Dream Repairman</i>, Clark offered a number of insights into their personal and professional relationship, as well as the often contradictory personality traits exhibited by the director, whom he recalled as "a very complex personality. The iron fist in the velvet glove."</p>
<dl>
<dd>"He was a complex man - he drank too much, smoked too much and was dangerously unpredictable. Jack was a barroom brawler who would, if provoked, attack people with his fists. He was also charming and seductive, which masked his many faults."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Clark quickly came to share the high esteem in which Clayton was held by colleagues, saying that Clayton "... mesmerized me, having a Svengali effect. He was absolutely revered by the crew, and I cannot deny falling under his spell." Clark recalled the experience of editing <i>The Innocents</i> as easy and pleasurable, thanks to Clayton's meticulous approach to filmmaking, recalling that Clayton had "a very certain approach to his material, having worked out everything beforehand. He was a perfectionist who left nothing to chance, and was very precise in his approach to work."</p>
<p>In contrast, however, Clark also remarked on Clayton's "legendary" indecision, which he claimed was the reason it took him so long to settle on a new project, and which (in Clark's view) made Clayton prone to 'agonising' over sequences he was unsure of, screening them again and again and making tiny adjustments until he was comfortable with the sequence.&#160;:</p>
<p>Clark also described Clayton as "a big drinker who used to tipple all day - mostly brandy - and he was a chain smoker". He considered that Clayton had "a perverse sense of humour", and that the director (who, in his view, had been "highly influenced" by his contact with <a href="/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a>) also emulated Huston's "sadistic sense of practical joking". Clayton's personal assistant Jeannie Sims (who had previously worked for Huston) had been badly burned as a child, leaving her with scars on her hands and face, and she was terrified of fire, but according to Clark, Clayton "made it his business to try and set Jeanie alight as often as possible. He would go to enormous lengths, preparing bonfires that Jeanie would supposedly be put onto."</p>
<p>As noted above, Clark also revealed that, while often charming, Clayton could be temperamental, and was sometimes prone to outbursts of extreme anger. He recounted one incident in which Sims was unavoidably late calling Clayton with the reviews from the pre-released critics' screening of <i>The Innocents</i>. When Sims finally contacted him, Clayton (who had been too nervous to attend) reportedly flew into a rage, viciously berating Sims over the phone, and when Clark arrived at Clayton's studio office the next morning, he discovered that Clayton had completely smashed a large plaster scale model of Bly House, and was refusing to speak to them. Although Clark worked with Clayton on both <i>The Innocents</i> and <i>The Pumpkin Eater</i>, their working relationship and friendship effectively ended after the latter film, after Clayton apparently sent Clark a vitriolic letter blaming him for the failure of the film. The two met again at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, while Clayton was working on <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, during which (according to Clark):</p>
<dl>
<dd>" (Clayton) upset everyone by hurling a chair through his office window. The office window was on the first floor and the chair landed on some executive's parked Mercedes."<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
